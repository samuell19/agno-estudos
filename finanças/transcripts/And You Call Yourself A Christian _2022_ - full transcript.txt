Hi! Hello, hello. Thanks, Lydia. I hope I'm not too late. No, not at all. I'm actually glad you're a little late. Remember what I taught you about being fashionably late? Come on in. Okay, now they are prepped and ready for you, okay? Don't be nervous. You got this. I have faith in you. Ladies, our guest of honor has arrived. I would like to introduce all of you to Ms. Unique Gray. Now, while she is not our newest representative, she is here to show us some of our new seasonal line as well as some tried and true must haves. So again, while she is not new, this is her first product party. So please give her your full attention and a bountiful round of applause. Thank you. Hello, ladies. Thank you so much for allowing me to introduce myself and our new products today. Thank you for coming, girl. You know you are the bestest! Now let's get this thing started so I can get my gifts for coming to this thing. Now, if you ladies don't mind, I would like to start with a prayer before we get started. A prayer? Girl, I didn't come here to go to church. I came here to get my free products, a bottle of Satin Hands, the big one. Yeah, girl. Listen, I am here for the food, the goodies and the wine. Okay? Right. Father God, I thank You so much for these beautiful sisters standing before me. I thank You that each and every one of them got here safe, sound, and without harm. I thank You in advance that they return to their dwellings, families, and mates safe as well. God, you must love me so much to be in the presence of such strong, honorable women. Amen. I wish nothing but blessings and favors in their lives, to whatever dreams and goals they may have. Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, God, for making these women the head and not the tail, the lender, not the follower. Let them know that you don't need makeup to be beautiful. They already are. Now repeat after me, ladies. I am beautiful. I am beautiful. No. Say it like you mean it. I am beautiful. Again. I am beautiful. Wait a minute. I was just getting into that. That's my jam. I humbly thank you in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Now, who wants to buy some products? - Yeah. - Yes, girl! - Hey, girl. - Hey. Girl, you now know I don't drink and party and cuss like I used to. Drink? Girl, you ain't seen drinking yet. The night just started. It's just a pre-game for a pre-game. - But you did good up there. - Thanks. Trying to get these uptight women up here to buy things they don't need? I couldn't do it. No, ma'am. No, I'm not judging. I used to be heavy in the life and in the streets, but not anymore. Now I'm focused on my career and getting ahead. Girl, with a little entrepreneurial spirit, I like a go-get attitude. That's why I came when you invited us here. Oh, I'm glad you came. Of course, girl. You look good. Satin looks good and everything. Thank you. Hello, Mother. Well, how did it go? I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Nick was supposed to come over here, but, you know, he had to work, so I stayed at home. It went fine. I sold a lot of product. Okay. Are you able to get on the train or take an Uber? You know, I got the girls here and I do not like to leave them by themselves at night. I understand, it's okay. I'll make it work. Unique, honey, what's wrong? You just had the most successful product party and you look like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders. Yes, ma'am. I'm fine. That was just my ride canceling on me. Oh, no worries, I'll take you home. That's no problem. No, that's okay. I can walk. The train is not that far. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. There is no way I'm going to let you walk with all that stuff. There's just no way. You stay put, I'm gonna go get my purse. Okay? Stay put. Okay. That car's been running hot, so you need to make sure you stop and put some water in it if it overheats. And there's some oil in the trunk if you need that too. I already put gas in the car, and now I've got to put oil in it, too? Look, I'm letting you and your boys stay here while you get yourself together. And I'm letting you use my car. How're you gonna complain? 'Cause I can let you walk. Thank you. Miracle. You're right. Four wheels beat two heels any day. That's right. And bring it back on time so I can get to work. I always bring it back on time. There's a first for everything. You're going to see one of your trifling baby daddies, ain't no telling what's gonna happen. Ain't nothing is gonna happen. I'm just going to pick up the child support he owe me. Girl, you need to take that jerk to court. All this running around, collecting money, like you're the sheriff? That's not cute. Come on, boys, Let's go. It's your favorite station, 92.5. - Hot. - Really hot. I'm sorry, babies. Ain't anything I can do about this heat. When I borrowed Aunt Miracle's car, I forgot it had no air conditioner. I promise we won't be long, okay? Okay. I just need to go see Dante's daddy. This is getting old. Sweet Jesus, cover me with your love and protection. Which daddy are we gonna see, Mama? We are gonna see Big Dante. That's Dante's daddy. What about my daddy? We never get to see my daddy. Well, we can't right now, we have to wait until he gets out. How long is he gonna be in the army, Mama? Army? Who told you your daddy is in the army? He's not in the army. - Grandmama told me, he was in the Army. - Dante! Grandma was mistaken. She made a mistake. He was not in the Army. He is in the Marines. Oh! The Marines! What about my daddy? Is he in the Marines too? Well, sometimes when grown people do things that aren't good things, they have to go away for a while. It's like... It's like time out for grown-ups. That boy needs a daddy? I can be his daddy. I can be his daddy, you can be his mama, we can make some beautiful babies together. Y'all stay by the car. Don't lock it, remember? You can't open it from the inside. Don't lock yourselves in. It's hot. I told you I can't help that. I'll be right back. I need you to be Mama's big boys, okay? No. Now, watch your brothers until I get back, okay? Okay, Mama, I can do that. I know you can. And you'll do a good job. And when I come back, we'll go get ice cream, okay? Yay! Can I please buy two ice-creams? Don't lock it. I'll be just a minute, okay? Go take them, Mama. What's up, y'all? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? How you doin'? Well, well, well. I never expected to see you here. Well, he wouldn't come to me, so I had to come to him. Where is he? How do you think I'm supposed to know? 'Cause you are his boy. You're never more than two steps away from him. That's why I call you two steps. Where he at? Follow me. Oh damn. Wait right here. All right. Hey, boo. Don't call me that. You used to like it. I used to like a lot of things. I used to be of the world. I'm a woman of God now. Washed in the blood of Jesus and walking in the light of the right path. Yeah, if you say so. I say so and I mean it. What can I do for you, boo? You know why I'm here, Dante. I need that child support you owe me. I owe you? What them other players doing? Don't worry about them other players. Worry about what you do for your child. You're looking good. You got your hair did, new clothes, and you got your nails done. I do all that with the money I make from selling cosmetics. I am doing okay. But I got three boys, and they need food and clothes and shoes. Our own house. Their own beds. - My boys need more. - My boys. We're living with my sister, sleeping on palettes in the back room. That's not what I see for us. Our boys? Our boys? I have one boy with you and you won't even let me see him. Why would I let you see him if all you got to show him is this? This ain't what I've seen for our boy. But you want this money, right? Come on, Dante. Use this for my son. Not the other two. They got daddies. I take care of all my boys. That's why you came here, right? Whatever. I got your whatever. Boy, stop. I ain't got time for you. Unique, we've always made pretty babies. You're silly. Everybody want pretty babies. And I got time for you. I got three in the car and I need to go. Man, we got to go. Hey, hey, let's get out of here. I need to get to my boys. - Unique. - Dante. - Unique! - Come on! No wait, Unique! I have to get to my boys. Dante, my boys. Freeze! Don't move! Man, let me go. Unique! Oh, there she is. The princess awakens. Where am I? Did I hit my head? Yeah, while resisting arrest. Resisting arrest? What are you talking about? Why would I be arrested? Because it's illegal to sell drugs. I didn't... I don't sell drugs. What is this on me? All right, you were at a known drug house with a known drug dealer. If you weren't there selling drugs, buying drugs, or even doing drugs, why were you there? I was picking up child support for my son. Well, child support. That's a new one. No, really. I just went there to pick up money. Okay, okay, so let's say that's the case. You were there to pick up money for "child support." Why were you resisting arrest? And why did the police on the scene find drugs on you? I didn't have drugs on me. There was a foil wrapped package, full of drugs, in your bag. No, no, that was money. Dante gave me money for his son. For his school supplies and uniforms... My baby is starting school and he needs those things. So where's your son now? I mean, you've been here for two days, - and school started yesterday. - Two days? He was by the car with his brothers. Oh, my God. Can you take this off? Okay. Just calm down. Where is this car? I parked by the house. I parked it around the corner of the house. I'll be right back. Take this off. This is Detective Brad Davis from 27. Yeah, uh, I need to talk to your supervisor. Yes. I don't know where the hell Unique is. She's been gone two days. Two! I had to get the bus to get to work. Who is it? Who is it? I said, who the hell is it? What the hell? Girl, let me call you back. Young lady, you're in a lot of trouble. You a lie. I ain't do nothing. And I don't know nothing. You're a piece of work. Whatever. You think you're pretty tough, huh? What gets me, is how you think you can get away with it. I done told you. I didn't do nothing. Oh really? You think leaving three babies in a hot car on a hot day is nothing? What? Oh, my God! Are they? Are they? What do you think? Wait, where is my sister? Your sister? Who the hell is your sister? I'm busy here. So, let me get this right. That woman in there loaned her car to her sister. Her sister then took it and those babies to a known dope house and left them in the car, when it's hot enough to fry fish, and she hasn't been seen since? Pretty much. She submitted a police report three days ago, that said that her sister stole her car and went to visit one of the boy's father's house. Does that missing sister have a record? No. - This one? - No. So we got to let her go. Yeah. We gotta let her go. Where in the hell is that damn irresponsible sister? All right, listen up. There is no car with three little boys in it. The place... where the place you got caught buying drugs. I told you I wasn't buying drugs. Okay. I need you to help me out here. Okay? I'm trying to help you out, so I need you to help me out. Now, if you can help me, take down Dante, maybe, just maybe, I can get your sentence lightened. But I don't need you lying to me about some fake boys that's in distress... My boys are not fake! Trying to get some sympathy from me? I mean, that's a lie that can't be sustained. - Come on now. - I'm not lying. Then where are the boys? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe my sister got them. I mean, she knew where I was going, and she needs her car to get to work. All right, so you have a sister? All right. Give her a call. I don't know her number. Okay, put yourself in my shoes. We pick you up at a known drug house. Okay? Resisting arrest, with a bag full of drugs. Then you send me on some wild goose chase out here looking for some boys who don't even frikkin' exist. They exist! Then you claim you got a sister, that you want to call, but you don't know her number. Doesn't that sound kind of suspicious to you? She got a new phone. I don't know the number. It's in my phone. Can I get my phone? You know what? You want a lot. But you gotta give to get. And right now you've given me nothing I can use. I need to talk to my sister. You know what? People in hell need ice water. I'll be back. Father God, I need your help on this one. Lord, help me to be right about this woman. I do not believe that she's some misguided soul out here, selling drugs and doing drugs. But, Father God, the evidence. The evidence is so strong against her. My gut tells me that she's innocent. Please, God, let me be right about this one. Let me be right. As soon as I get off today, I'm gonna stop by the store, pick up some ice cream, maybe we could have the boys over, give Unique a break. That would be nice, but I haven't heard from Unique in a couple of days. And she was supposed to have a cosmetic demonstration for me and some of the ladies at the church. It's not like her to space out like that. I know. She has been better at being a woman of her word ever since she got saved and started her own business. Did you call her? Of course I called her. Her not showing up is a direct reflection on me, and I have a stellar reputation at New Day Baptist Church. You have a stellar reputation wherever you go, baby. And that's why you love me. Babe, let me call you right back. Okay, I'll talk to you later. What do we... Excuse me. What do we have here? Three little boys. Someone abandoned them in a car. - My God - It's awful. Whoever did this is gonna burn in hell. I pray they didn't suffer long, but I know they did suffer. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, I'm Detective Davis. Are these kids? Yeah, it always seems worse when it's babies. Oh, my goodness. - You mind if I look? - Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. We see this more times than we should and it never gets any easier. Where's the mother? Don't know. We got dispatched through 911. Not our first time there, though. Last time it was for an overdosed junkie in the middle of a stairwell. Were the bodies found on Hipner Street? Yes, sir. In an abandoned car. I know these boys. I know these kids. They're my girlfriend's grandbabies. Excuse me, gentlemen. I need to get these bodies to the morgue. This ain't happening. All right, Detective. No need to be over-zealous. We need to go easy on this one. I don't think she took it easy on those three kids that died, Detective. Just do it right, man. Proper. Why should we show her that same respect? Just do it proper, Detective. All right, fellows, we discussed this. We can do it better. Unique Emerald Gray, you are under arrest. What's going on? We discussed this. Detective, I have three dead kids on my hands. I'm not concerned about her emotions nor coddling her motives. She's been here two days. Three dead kids? What are you saying? - Read her rights. - You have the right to remain silent. What's going on? Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Where are my boys? Your boys are dead, dead, dead. You're lying! Listen, Unique, they found your boys dead in the car. - I don't believe you. - Let's go. Get out of here. Why are you doing this to me? Hey, where are you going? Not your business. You know, everybody needs a friend in here. Especially you. My friends list is full. Play it that way. Sooner or later, you're gonna need a friend. Benson. Yeah, okay. I'll go get her. Gray. You have a visitor. Tell her to go away. It's not a her. It's a them. And both of them claim to be your mama. You got two mommies, girl? I don't recall this being any of your business, inmate. Stay in your lane. I just said what you was thinking. You instigating is what you're doing. I'm not going to have to tell you this again. Let's go. Unique has two mommies. It's not even like that. Who are you anyways? Well roomie, when you get back, you tell me which one breasted you and who is the good mommy and who is the bad mommy. Unique has two mommies. Unique has two mommies. Unique has two mommies. Ladies, we have a problem. If you two are not her mothers, but both of you are her mother, we have a problem. I'm Unique Emerald Gray's mother. I am Unique Emerald Gray's mother. Well, I'm no science teacher, but I know a person can only have one mother. Which one of you is it? It's complicated. No, it's not. I raised that girl and I'm the woman that she calls Mama. I gave birth to that girl. Then you threw her away. It wasn't like that. Oh yeah, what was it like? It's complicated. It's not complicated at all. You laid with a man, you get pregnant, you had a baby, you raise the baby. Not complicated at all. You don't know me. I don't need to know, I know the girl I raised, and I know the woman she has become. As entertaining as this has been, and as entertaining as I know it's going to be, I don't have time to play word games with you two. I'm just going to go ask the inmate who she wants to see. - I love Unique. - And I love Unique. I was young, I was lost. I hadn't seen the light or found my path. I hadn't been touched by God or been washed in the blood of the lamb. When I gave up Unique, I did what I had to do. It was the best at the time for the both of us. No, it wasn't the best. It was just the easiest. You can't judge me harder than I can judge myself. You can't even hold it against me harder than I can hold it against myself. Now, I lost Unique. But God, in His infinite wisdom, gave me another chance with those two beautiful girls. And I will not make a mistake. Satan is behind me now. Well, Satan might be behind you now. But he is in front of Unique and she got a fight on her hand that's going to take all of our strength and all of our prayers and all of our love to help her win. Well, she's made up her mind who she'd like to see. It's her. Hello, baby, how are you? They're dead, Mommy. My babies are dead. Guard. Guard. Ma'am, I want you to calm down. How can I calm down? You got my baby in handcuffs like she's a natural born killer. She is! She left them babies in the car and in the heat. Girl, it's your... Oh-ho-ho, I can't. Young lady, I don't know you, but so help me God, you better keep my daughter's name out of your mouth. Your daughter? Your daughter's name is all over TV. So I ain't gotta say it. So I ain't gotta say Jack. - I don't have to. - Why's... TV? Why would my name be on TV? The story made the news, baby. What are they saying about me? You a killer. You know what you did. - Oh, my God! - I will come in here... Ma'am, I suggest if you don't want to be behind bars like your daughter, you better come with me. But that woman over there harassing me and my child. You punishing me? That's not fair. Life ain't fair. Ask those little boys. You biased and that's why you letting that woman harass us. That's enough! Why? Why have you forsaken me? Sweet Jesus. What did I do to deserve this? Has my past caught up with me? Am I being punished? I know that this is my fault, Father God. I know it is. But you have to know I wasn't in that house backsliding. I wasn't buying drugs, or up to any shenanigans. I was just there to get child support. No, no, God, it wasn't worth it. No amount of money would have been worth it. This is my fault. My greed cost me my children and all I wanted was child support. I deserve to be here. Even if it means being here for the rest of my life. What are you staring at? Stalker. Don't flatter yourself. You ain't all that. So what's your story? You know all my business. What about you? So, there was this girl I knew, in love with this guy. One day, he asked her to prove her love for him. So he asked her to deliver a package. Thing was, she had to swallow the package to make the delivery. You know? So she wouldn't get caught carrying it. Problem was, the girl got real sick, 'cause one of the packages blowed up inside her. She woke up in handcuffs, and... the doctor told her that, the package that almost killed her, killed the baby she ain't know she was carrying. Then what happened? She lost her baby, she lost her freedom, she lost the guy. What happened to the guy? Cousins found him. She ain't seen or heard nothing else from him. I'm sorry. Three little boys, three precious souls, losing their lives in broad daylight, whilst their mother Unique Emerald Gray was in that house over there buying drugs. Three boys, two days, excessive heat... ...and neighborhood indifferent. This is Maria reporting live from WDBN. Who is it? Girl, why didn't you use your key? I don't know. I'm just so discombobulated. What's going on? She chose her, Mama, she chose her. Who chose who? Unique. She chose that woman over me. I don t know what you're saying. I went to see Unique, but when I got there, there was another woman there saying that she was her mother. I don't understand. It was Korica, her adoptive mother. Only one of us could go in and see her and Unique chose her. She chose her to talk to. I have to go back there tomorrow. But when I get there and that woman is there, she might choose her again. And I would have wasted another day. Baby, it's not a waste, if you do what God has led you to do. What did God lead you to do? God led me to see her. And to be there for her. God led me to do what's right. Then you don't have to think about it. You just have to do it. If that means going to see your child every day, then you go see your child. If she decides to pick Korica, then you will be there when she decides to pick you. Sweetheart, this is not about hurt feelings anymore. Because all your hurt feelings won't bring back those boys. Baby, you have your freedom. You have two beautiful girls and a man that loves you. You have so much. But right now, Unique, she has so very little. Oh, my baby. I know. I know. Come here, sweetheart. It's okay. It's all right. It's going to be okay. It was only after the car sat here for two days that one concerned citizen made the call to the authorities. Even though they have captured the neglectful, drug-taking mother, sources say, that the father of one of the boys was the leader of a drug ring... How are you doing, big man? It's been on all day. You might need to eat something to keep up your strength. My son is dead! Both him and his brothers are dead. I know me and Unique wasn't together no more, but they're making it seem like she's some cracked out chicken head. That's bullshit right there. I don't know whether she gonna get more time for carrying the drugs or the boys. She had more drugs on her than you usually carry. I gave her the wrong package. It was supposed to be the money. Accidents happens. My son is dead. Accidents happens, man. Did you guys see what she did? She actually killed her kids. She left them in a car. Oh, my God! How can you do that to kids? - They're just boys. - Who leaves their kids in the car? Exactly. Who would do that? She deserves to burn. Oh yeah. She needs to go. Yes, absolutely. That is insane. How are you just sitting here, just calm, like... It'll come, whatever is supposed to come to her. Karma is gonna hit her hard. Definitely hit her. Lord, I know that by no means am I worthy to be in you, but my God... I thank you that I'm not what I used to be. A might long way, God. That's where You brought me from. A mighty long way. Are you talking to God again, Mommy? Yes. You talk to God, does he ever talk back? You know what he said? What'd he say? He said, if these boys of yours don't brush their teeth, wash their faces and get ready for bed, I want you to tickle them to death. Where's your foot? Girl, I told you when I let y'all move in here that it needs to be quiet in here at night so that I can get up and go to work in the morning. I'm sorry, Miracle. Boys, tell your Aunt Miracle, we're sorry. Sorry. Y'all ain't sorry. Y'all just loud. Inmate Gray, get up! Grab your stuff. You're being transferred. Transferred? Where am I going? Women's Correctional Facility. I haven't even had my trial yet. Not my rodeo, not my bull. Just grab your things. I haven't been here long. I don't have anything. Then you should be ready to go. Never say I never gave you nothing Thank you. You were right. I did need a friend in here. I won't forget. I promise I'll stay in touch. You better, and don't thank me. It's what I do. By the way, I ain't write all that stuff on the first one. I understand some things sometimes. Ladies and... We're here at your new home away from home. I need you to stand up and exit the bus in an orderly and timely fashion. That includes you, sunshine. I don't feel good. What's the matter? Stomach? Nauseating? Yes. Yeah. Well, I can help you with that. Here in my left pocket, I have a can of no one gives a shit. No one gives a shit, if you feel good or not. No one gives a shit, if you puke your head off. No one gives a Kentucky fried shit about you. All we care about is you getting your black ass up and off my bus. Let's go. Come on. What are you doing? Now you know that you're going to clean that shit up, with your shirt. Hey. Yeah. Come on in here. Let's see what you got. I don't have anything. Oh, we'll find out. We'll be the judge of that. Now strip. Strip? Yeah, strip. Take it all off. This ain't your annual gynecology exam. We're a little more thorough up in here. Now strip. Everything? Everything. Everything. Come on. Come on. You're moving mighty slow for crackhead baby killer. Today, sis. Today. Oh, tears. Aw! Mm. My babies. Look at the crackhead killer crying. Girl... hah! I ain't got time for this. No, you're taking too long. No, mm-mm, no. Come on, you got to go out. Out! - Let's go. Let's go. - Come on! Get in there. Take your shower. Now! Move. You stink. ...killed your kids. Got a nerve to be crying. Stinking murderer. I'd be crying too. You stink. No sympathy for you. She gotta take a shower. Let's go. Hurry up. You got two minutes. On behalf of New Day Missionary Baptist Church you have our thoughts, our prayers and our sympathy., No one can imagine the pain that you and your family are experiencing right now. Thank you, Sister Paige. It's a stressful time for us. The television is saying such terrible things about my baby. And I'm afraid people will believe it. I'm afraid she won't get a fair trial. I need the church to help me to find a good lawyer, who isn't swayed by public opinion and will do everything to get her off. Mm-hmm. She has already been through so much. Of course, of course, I already talked to the pastor about it. The church elders, they agreed, also. Unique is one of us now. Ever since she left those streets, and joined our church, she's one of us. You know, it's hard, when someone of the world, gives up worldly things, - and chooses to follow Christ. - Amen. Sorry, I'm not gonna be able to honor your request. But why not? Ms. Gray, you're responsible for the death of three little boys. In the eyes of the law, you're a murderer. In the court of public opinion, you're the worst type of offender. I cannot in good conscience allow you to attend a funeral. But, Your Honor... I'm a warden, not a judge. Well you're judging me now and I haven't even had my trial yet. The facts are the facts. Please, Your Honor... Warden. My boys were all I had. It was for them that I went to that house to get the child support. You know, that story doesn't sound convincing, no matter how many times you tell it. It's the truth. And truth be told, I will not bend, I will not fold, I will not be moved. You call yourself a Christian, right? Surely you can appreciate my steadfast beliefs and adherence to the rules. Are you a Christian? No, I'm a warden. Are you a Christian? I was. Well, maybe one day we can sit and discuss your fall from grace. No, Warden, you and I have nothing else to talk about. I haven't dismissed you yet. What are you gonna do? Put me in jail? It's a shame I had to meet her under these circumstances. This is the part of my job that I do not look forward to, especially under these circumstances. Three little angels. Dante Jr., Javion, and Kajarvis. I'd like to introduce to you Pastor Williams who will lead us in prayer. Lord, we come now at this most difficult time, understanding, God, that You are the author and finisher of our faith. So, God, certainly You know, what is going on and what this family is going through right now. Three young boys that you chose to call home to glory. God, we come with many not understanding why. So, God, these families need You right now, like never before. God, You promised to be our comforter in our time of need. So, Lord, right now, in the name of Jesus, we come calling upon Your holy and righteous name, praying, O God, that you would saturate these families with peace. That you would touch their hearts and remind them that you are still their God. God, it's hard. Don't know how we're going to make it. Because we know that you're able to see us through. Lord, we just thank you for how you've blessed. Thank you for how you've kept. And we thank you for what you're going to do. We bless your mighty name. Let the church say - Amen. - Amen. Oh, God. Mm, thank you. It was a beautiful funeral. Yeah, you did a good job getting everything together. Mm. I still can't believe that the Warden wouldn't let my baby out of jail. They still think she was buying drugs while my grandsons died. Justice will be served. Well, I have to believe that justice, goodness and righteousness will prevail. But time and time again, the system failed us. We see that justice is just us. And I don't want my grandbabies deaths reduced to a hashtag. It was a horrible accident. And all our lives have changed because of it. But Unique has suffered more than anybody can imagine. Justice could be merciful. And I pray that one day soon she can join us here. Yeah, I don't have to have children in order to understand your feelings on this. You a good man, Nick. Ooh, I still can't believe I had doubts about marrying you. What? I said I had, not have. What? You had your doubts about marrying me? How could you say that? I stood by you through this entire ordeal, and before that, I waited patiently while you struggled with being true to your faith and being intimate with me. I've accepted parts of you, Loraine, when I wanted and needed and deserved all of you, I think you need to decide what you want from me, because I know what I want from you. And like I said, a part of you ain't it. Nick. Nick? Where are you going? Nick. Nick. Where are you going? As your attorney, I have to advise you that what you want to do is not in your best interest. I know the church hired you and I really appreciate it. You're way better than the public defender I had. But you still work for me and I've made up my mind. Pleading guilty to causing the death of your boys is not smart. It was an accident. We all know it was an accident. The only reason why they are throwing the book at you is because of where the boys were found. This is a mistake, Unique. I've already made the biggest mistake I could possibly make. I chose to leave my boys. I chose to go to that house. I did that. I know there's a hell, because this place is hell. Let me tell you what I know. I am very good at what I do. Let me help you. Do you know how many black women are in here with extended sentences for possessing small amount of crack? I mean, the amount of no larger than two pennies. I had thirty grams of crack, and two hundred pills on me. I'll get more time for possessing the drugs that I didn't sell than for the murder of my kids. My babies lives are worth less than an envelope. So I don't care what y'all think. I just need you to plead me out and I don't care which one. I don't feel like fighting. I understand how you feel. No, you don't. You have your freedom. Ye of little faith. Ms. Gray. Ms. Gray. Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying. I'm here to talk to you about your sister. I don't have nothing to say. I'm her attorney and I wanted to talk to you about being a character witness. Can't some of those good Christian people down from the church do that? I'm too mad at her to be a character witness. Why are you mad at her? Lady, I don't have time for none of this. Unique borrowed my car and drove it down to the crack house. She went to see that deadbeat, when I told her to take his trifling butt to court. They still have my car in the impound, and I can't get it back because they're saying it's a part of the crime investigation. I missed two days of work because I keep going back and forth to that jail and she won't see me. I have to catch a ride because I don't have a car anymore. And all of this is Unique's fault. Hi. Hi. - Mrs. Middleton? - Yes. Nice to meet you. My name's Janai Rodriguez. - We spoke on the phone? - Yes. Please come in. Have a seat. Mrs. Middleton, thank you for having me. Oh, it's nothing. I'm actually happy you called me. I'd love to be a character witness for Unique. She was such a hard-working and dedicated soldier. Ever since she got saved and turned her life around, none of the women in my charge worked as hard as she did. She moved her product and she was finally making some leeway. Were you aware of her buying, selling, or using drugs? Of course not. She was high on life. There was no room in her heart. There was no room in her spirit for anything, but her three boys. God bless their hearts. And the word of Jesus. They're saying such horrible, horrible things about her. Making all kinds of assumptions. That's very un-Christian like. Would you be willing to say this in court? In court? Honey, I'll scream it from the mountaintops. Hey, bro. You seen this guy? I don't know that man, and I ain't seen him. I didn't ask if you knew him, I asked if you've seen him. No and no. All right, look here. You're not answering my question correctly, which gives me pause. Man, I don't care if that gives you pause. I don't know that man. All right, really? Assume the position. - I ain't did nothing. - Come on, come on. Come on. See, you're mouth is saying one thing, but your body language and your whole reaction, says another. And right now, everything about you is making my spidey-sense tingle. And I'm a man who follows his instinct. All I know is, you taking me in and I ain't did nothing. Of course, we're just going down to the station to talk. Let's move. - We can talk right here. - Nope. I know he's a good man, Mama. I know. It's just that sometimes we need to know who we are. So that, other people can believe in us and the goodness we have to share. Nicholas is a good man. And I'm a good woman. But until I can reconcile that I deserve that goodness, the two of us can't be together. I needed this time to focus on Unique and give her all that I have to give. Nicholas is going to have to wait. I know that. And you're feeling some kind of way because you weren't always there for her. And then seeing that woman that raised her, sent you over the edge. But, Unique is in a different kind of head space. Now that's the space you can't get next to. She's going to trial. And she might end up going away for a long time. Baby, you can't punish yourself and hold off on your happiness out of some misguided guilt because your emotions are running amok. Oh... I love Nicholas. I really do. But I can't let my love for him get in the way of me trying to save Unique from a fate she doesn't deserve. If Nick is the man that I think he is, he'll understand that and he'll wait on me. Sometimes, my dear, you have to put your feelings and your happiness to the forefront. I mean, love doesn't always wait for us to get it together. You know, especially, when there are a lot other those single, hungry women at church dying to experience just a sliver of what you have. What are you saying, Mother? I'm saying, everyone that says that they are a Christian, is not. Well, I am. And although Nick is of the world... Hmm. He knows that I'm a Christian. He knows what I was, and he knows what I am. Be that as it may, many good Christian women have lost their men because they can't figure out when to be a Christian. Well, I'm always a Christian. Oh, I am too, but then after your father died, I decided to stay single. Uh, no offense, Mother, but we're coming from two totally different places. I hear you. And I am honored to have a daughter strong in her faith and convictions. You make me so proud. But I pray, sweetheart, you don't make me right. Okay? Okay, bye-bye. See what happens when you don't bring my car back on time. Oh, my God, Unique. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry about your car. I don't care about that car. You don't have to lie to me. I know you loved that car. Not as much as you loved those boys. Stop crying. We can't talk if you're crying. Can't we get the guards to give you some tissue or something? I can't stand looking at the snot. Guard, can my sister get some tissue? Keep getting loud and you're gonna end up in here too. You ain't gotta be nasty. My sister just needs some tissue, that's all. No tissues for baby killers. You had to go there. It's okay. They can't do that. She can't talk to you like that. They all talk to me like that. Some of them whisper under their breath. Some of them not so shy. Baby killer, murderer, unfit mother, I hear it all day every day. They can't do that. This is prison. They can and will keep doing it. At first it got to me, I mean, really got to me. But then I realized, they're right. I am an unfit mother. I deserve this hell I'm in. Don't beat yourself up like that. At first I was mad. I was angry. It's a raggedy car. But it was my car. And it ran, it kept me off the bus. It got me to and from work. But when I didn't have the car, I realized how much I liked it. It was my first car and it was mine. When they gave it back to me, I didn't even want it. I couldn't. I can't drive it. I'm still catching rides. You might as well go ahead and drink it, we already have your prints, and we know who you are. It's not your first rodeo, Clarence Little. That's the name my mama gave me. Why did Dante give Unique the drugs? Man, I don't know what you talking about. Can I get a sandwich to go with this soda? You interrupted me before I got a chance to finish my lunch and a fella get a little peaky when I don't eat on the regular. I'm sure I can send somebody out. - Roast beef sound good to you? - No. I'm cutting back on red meat. Turkey is fine. Mm-hmm. Sure I can take care of that for you. Chips? Potato salad? All that. Yeah, all that. - And a pickle too. - Oh, a pickle? Do you want two of everything to go with that order? Because there was two sandwiches in your bag. I got a big appetite. Right. All right, and while we wait on those sandwiches, let's talk. I don't talk that much. You go right ahead. I'll listen. Well, No need beating around the bush. I didn't think you would. You don't seem like that type of a man. Oh, you can read me that well? Yeah, like an open Bible. Some people are closed off. Others show their hand while holding their other hand behind their back with a knife in it. Well, people like you, they come at you all clean, saying read me. I pride myself on reading people. Oh, you know, me too. You know, I rely on my instinct and my gut. Just like I know you know where Dante is. And my gut tells me Unique Emerald Gray was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and she got caught up. And it was a horrific thing what happened to her kids. Nothing to be locked up for. So you're right. Oh, so you do know the people I'm talking about. Nah, brother, the only thing I know is what I see on the news. And that girl's name and face has been all over it. Even had the nerve to have pictures of those three little boys smiling and looking so angelic. It was a shame. A crying shame. But if you ask me, it was popo's fault, charging up in there, slamming that girl against the wall so hard, she fell out. Excessive force. Police brutality. All that is the reason why them boys are dead. Here's your lunch. Thank you. I like a good sandwich. Enjoy that sandwich. I'll be right back. Like you said, don't take too long. Like I said, this ain't my first rodeo. So if you ain't holding me with nothing or charging me with anything, I'm out of here as soon as I finish my lunch. Oh, one more thing, how do you know she was thrown up against the wall? This is Janai Rodriguez. Yes, Pastor, thank you so much for calling. We're putting together character witnesses for my client, Unique Emerald Gray. And having someone of your standing in the community vouch for her would mean so much. Yes, of course, I can meet you after service. You want me to come to service? Sure, sure. Yep, I certainly can. Thank you so much. It's a beautiful day here at New Day. Amen. Amen. Now you know how we do it here. Turn to your neighbor, one that you don't know, introduce yourself and say, I am blessed and highly favored. How about you? I am blessed and highly favored. How about you? I'm Bradley. Bradley Davis. Janai Rodriguez. I'm blessed and highly favored. How about you? Likewise. Now, today, I am not going to preach. Mm-mm. Today I would like to talk to you. Today we are going to have an intimate conversation about forgiveness. But not forgiving someone for wronging you, but forgiving ourselves for being human. And making mistakes, bad choices, and bad decisions. Even if those bad choices and bad decisions have life-altering consequences. Even if those bad choices and bad decisions are hard. Even if they are wrong, today is about owning our part in all of the dirt and grime and ugliness that is the aftermath of our choices. In order to move forward, we must forgive ourselves for being human and sometimes weak. Like I said, I'm not preaching today. We're going to talk about our famous brother Job, and all of his trials and tribulations that he experienced. And how his experience is being mirrored in our dear sister, Unique Emerald Gray. But unlike Job, her choices are being played out in the media, and she is being judged before she is rightfully judged. And I'll give to you the thought that it is just possible that she has sunken so low, into the depths of self-doubt that she is unable to forgive herself. That she has sunken so low into a place where she cannot see the light of day. Let alone the love of Jesus. Forgiveness. That is what I am talking to you about today. Forgiveness. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Hi, that was an incredible sermon, Pastor I'm Janai Rodriguez. Um, I spoke to you about my client, Unique. - Yes. - Yes. Those were very touching words, and and they really, really touched my heart. I wish Unique was here to hear them. And by only hearing them, she would have her burden lifted. You Ms. Gray's lawyer? Yes. I'm Detective Davis. I'm the lead investigator in her case. Well, I see you two have met. Yes, we were sitting next to each other during your sermon. Well, I said I wasn't preaching today, but won't he do it? Why don't we go in and break bread and figure out a strategy? Come on. My brother, I heard the popo got you. He ain't had nothing, he was just fishing. But he is showing your picture all over the place. My picture? Yeah, the ones you do know, ain't saying nothing. The ones you don't, well, I think it's best we get out of Dodge. That's right. What's this? It's your stuff. I was gonna drop it off at your baby mama's house. You know, when you got out, I put a little something-something in there for you too. I don't understand. This thing with Unique, I've been thinking, we done done some dirt. I can't change the past. I can't bring the boys back. But I can help Unique. This decision, my friend, is something I had to make. What you saying? Dawg, I'm saying, it's time you dust off that electrician license. What you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'll figure something out. Yeah, sometimes a man gotta do what a man gotta do. Yeah. Unique, it's so good to see you. I have great news. Did you get the deal? How much time I'm getting for the murder of my babies? I went to your church home and I spoke with your Pastor, and I have so many statements from people that want to be character witnesses. In addition, Bradley, I mean, Detective Davis feels as I do, that the police used excessive force and that caused your injury and you weren't able to alert anyone that the boys were in the car. If you don't do what I say, I can fire you, right? Technically, you didn't hire me. Your mom did. I can still fire you. I saw it on TV. I know how you feel. You do not. I am sorry. I can only imagine how you feel. I can only imagine that you're beating yourself up for what happened to the boys. But you can't keep doing this. You have to go on. You have to keep on. There is so much to live for. And if I have it my way, you won't be doing it in here. We just need one more win. We just need someone to say that you weren't in that house to buy drugs. I said it. My sister said it. We need someone in the house. Unfortunately, most of the people got away and the others were not in such good shape. They couldn't corroborate that you were there not to buy drugs, but we have three more weeks and that's still time for us to get someone to testify. All right, I'll give you three weeks. But if you can't find anybody who can admit that I wasn't in that house to buy drugs, we will go with my plan. I'm tired, beaten. I can't keep going like this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, you go ahead. I'm sorry. I was coming by tonight when I finished my rounds. I didn't like the way we parted last. I was coming by to fix it. I don't like the way things ended either. I was coming by to say, let's talk. Well, however it ended, it won't happen again like that again. - Hmm. - I love you, and I want to be with you and whatever issues we have, we need to discuss them. I agree. Well, I got to go back and finish my rounds, but I'll be back tonight and we can work out anything. I love you and I want to fight for this relationship. We worked it out, Mother. We worked it out. Me and Nick. Yeah. He's not going anywhere. He's the man that God sent me. We were meant to be together. So I'm going to stop doubting the word of God. Hallelujah! Praise God! Prayer answered. You know, God is good. All the time. All the time. Yeah, God is good. Amen. He surely is. I love you, Mom. I love you too. Aww. Oh, that's so good. So, so good. What's going on? It's been like this ever since Channel Two did that story on the baby killer this morning. The phone is ringing nonstop and those people just keep coming. That baby killer is my daughter. Well, maybe you should have done a better job of raising her, and she wouldn't be in here. I don't appreciate your tone. And I don't appreciate all the double work I get whenever we have some kind of celebrity inmate. I think I need to talk to your superior. Well, honey, you're going to have a long wait because my superior is God. Your earthly superior. Honey, my boss is outside with that crowd. So do you want to see the baby killer, or do you want to wait on my boss to get back in here? I will see my daughter then I'll have a conversation with your boss. Really? Well... Looks like you're going to have to come back tomorrow. She has had her maximum number of visitors for today. Are you kidding me? Bye. No, I am not. I... I think... I think we got off on the wrong... I think we got off on the wrong foot. I mean, look, I apologize for anything that I did to play a part in that. I've driven a long way. And I'm tired of all this attention, and I'm tired of the grief. You just lost your grandbabies, huh? Yes. I've got three babies and I have never left one in the car. Ever. Okay. Okay. I'm going to let you back there. All right? Thank you. - God bless you. - You welcome. God bless you. Yeah, sending one back. Yeah, just one. Thank you. Mm-hmm. You would have been so proud of your mama. Mom, that lawyer you got me is doing her own thing. She isn't listening to me. What are you saying? She doesn't want me to confess to the boys' murder. Why would you do that? That doesn't make any sense. Why would you do something like that? It's the smartest thing. I just want to get this over with. We are working on getting you no charges. There will be charges. Just because I'm in here doesn't mean I don't know what's going on out there. Unique, you sound hopeless. You sound faithless. What about your faith? That's what sustains us. That's easy to say on that side of the table. It's on this side where it's hard. No, no, no, no. When you have faith, you have it. All you need is a little bit of it. With a little bit of faith, an ant can move a mountain. I know, because I have had a faithless life and a faith filled one. In my faith filled life, I have had the girls, Nick, and you. That's what faith did for me. Now I call myself a Christian, because I am one. But you can't call yourself a Christian, if you're only one, when... things are convenient and easy. Trust me on this, Unique. Trust me. It's me, Lord. I know it's been a while since we last spoke. I didn't want to talk to you. I felt alone and abandoned. I felt like when I needed you the most, you weren't here for me. I wanted to give up and rot in here. But my family, biological and church, even Miracle, they tell me that you're still with me. I will take them by their word. Whatever your will, I'll abide. I just need a sign. Just give me a sign. I just need a sign. I'm here to see Detective Davis. Tell him Dante is here. Okay, sure. Detective Davis, you have a visitor to see you. Name is Dante. Okay, sure. He'll be right out. Someone here to see me? Me. I didn't expect to see you here. I didn't expect to be here. Before we begin, let me reiterate that my client is here of his own volition. And that the prior deal is still in play. Now, if there's no questions, my client will proceed. Can I have some water? Unique didn't do drugs. She barely drank. You know, the sweet stuff with the little umbrellas, lots of fruit, that was her jam. Anyway, we were supposed to meet up. I was supposed to give her some child support. Um... She was always working, and I was always busy. She said she was going to stop by and come get it. I was trying to convince her, you know, to get one more time. But she was going on about being saved and how God didn't want her going in reverse. Whatever the hell that means. I gave her a package. The wrong package. I didn't know about it until I saw it on TV. Those were my drugs. Not Unique's. And the only reason she didn't say nothing about the boys in the car, is 'cause y'all slammed her up against the wall. She passed out. The mother of my son, was passed out on the floor, and I ran. I just left her. It never dawned on me to go back and check on the boys in the car. So, that is on me as well... There. I finally said it out loud. Those baby deaths, are on my hands as well. If I had given her the right package, if we had met somewhere else, if I just went outside to talk to her, instead of having her come in, things could have gone a lot differently. Are we done? I believe we're done. I need you to come with me. Where are we going? It's too early for visitors. The Warden wants to see you. Ms. Gray, the last time we spoke, I asked you if you were a Christian. I'm not sure if you came to a conclusion yet, but today is your lucky day. What are you talking about? What do you want from me now? Look, if you put that attitude on the shelf, I'll tell you. So, apparently, something happened. He's confessed. He gave her the wrong package. All rise for the Honorable Judge Chambers. You may all be seated. - District Attorney LaRue. - Your Honor. Attorney Rodriguez, and Ms. Gray. This has been a very difficult situation for all. Whereas you made a very poor judgment call, I do not believe that you had malice in your heart or you were there to do anything other than what you said. Now we have all been made aware of the impropriety that has been going on with our police department. I am very aware that the officers involved used excessive force. Just because it has not come out in the public yet, please know, I'm quite aware. Like a statement my grandmother used to say, every closed eye ain't sleep and every goodbye ain't gone. We know what's going on. And it's that excessive force that caused your injury and indirectly caused the deaths of your children. Leaving you incarcerated serves no purpose. You will have the unfortunate task of living with your mistake forever. And the internal feeling of a parent who has outlived her children. This is something that no parent wishes on any other parent. Nonetheless, the circumstances show, that you have paid your debt to society. What? Your Honor. In more ways than one. You've paid a great cost. So today, we hereby release you from custody. You are free to go home. - Your Honor, wait. - You're free. Thank you, Your Honor. This is my judgment. It is time for you to leave, to get a new start in life, to make good decisions, and to be a productive member of the society that I know you can be. This meeting today is adjourned. Thank you, You Honor. Thank you. Congratulations. Great news. Ms. Gray, can I have a moment with you? Ms. Gray, are you a Christian? Yes. Yes, ma'am, I am. Then please allow me to give you my personal Bible. I'm a judge who has to use the law of the land. But there is no judgment that I can make without consulting this Bible first. Read it. Allow it to penetrate your heart. I want to tell you that it was the grace of God that showed up in this court today. And it's that same grace that will cover you and that same deep abiding love from God that will guide you. It was his grace that allowed you to show up in this meeting today. And to get the freedom that you need to move forward. Find solace in your family and friends, through this difficult time. It's time that you need for your healing process and to heal your heart. Thank you, Your Honor. You're welcome, dear. God's got you. - Hello. - Oh, my God, Tiny, you made it. I'm so happy. - It's actually Juliana. - Who? My name. Juliana. Never knew your name. We're right in the living room. Guys, ladies, this is Tiny. Tiny, this is everybody. Ah! It's so good having everybody together. Yeah. You people seen me through this difficult time. You helped me up when I couldn't help myself up. You nourished me when I couldn't eat. You comforted me when I couldn't sleep. I owe you all more than I could ever think of. I just ask you guys to do one more thing. Let us pray. Our Father, who art in heaven... Hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen It's all for you, my boys. It's all for you. Hello to all of you, and thank you for watching this film. My name is Marquis and I play Nick in the film. And I've come briefly just to extend an invitation to each and every one of you, for those who may not know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You may be wondering in this moment right now, while you're watching this invitation, are you talking to me? Is this me who you are really engaging in to come into this invitation? Just to know that if I'm not saved, how can I become saved? I know you've been misused. I know you've been ridiculed. I know you've been stabbed in the back. You've been talked about. You've been frustrated. You are indecisive about life's issues, conditions, and even where you are. But guess what? There is somebody who is here, who can help, who can deliver you out of anything. There is nothing that you have done that God cannot forgive you for. Guess what? Peter was just like you and I. At one point in our lives, he was saying, "God, how can I come to You? "How can I receive You?" And Jesus said, "Step out on the water." And Peter said, "If You bid me, I'll come." And when he came, he may have lost sight. But when he continued to understand who Christ was, he lifted his hand down reached him up and brought him back to where he was. Guess what? That's you and I. We were there. We were lost. We were drowning. But Jesus Christ, picked us up from where we are and brought us to the place where we are now. The Bible declares the only way that we can even come to him is unless the spirit of God draws us. So I'm happy to let you know that if you feel that tugging, can you feel it? Can you feel the power whispering in your ear to say, "It's your time"? Guess what? It's your time now. All you gotta do is repeat after me. If you believe that you are here today for a specific reason and assignment, guess what. Just repeat after me. Say, God, I believe that You raised Jesus from the dead and he now has ascended and sits at the right side of God with all power and authority and strength in His hand. If you believe that prayer, guess what, you're saved. There's nothing anybody can do about it. The Bible says the Angels are rejoicing just because of your singled out decision to live for God. Guess what? You are now a kingdom partner. You are now living in the kingdom that is not of this world. But you now have the opportunity to do what God has called you to do. Find yourself a good Bible based church, find yourself some people who can pour into you, who can love on you and to give you the unadulterated word of God to help you to mature, to become perfected in your Christian walk. That's you. You've made that decision. I'm so happy for you. The kingdom is happy for you. Guess what? Welcome to the body of Christ. May nothing that you do, stop you from coming to where God has called you to be. And I hope that you enjoy the rest of living your life for God. Thank you, God bless.
