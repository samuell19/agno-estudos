Well, my reaction was... isn't anybody watching the factory? It's not like when you go on a vacation you bring a dozen back with you. This guy was bringing thousands and thousands of them over. Scott was furious that this was happening. So, his mission was to find out who was doing this. ♪ [sneaky music plays] [Richie] I was a police officer for 20 years, and I started my newsletter, Pez Collectors News, in 1995. As a collector, the idea of the newsletter was to get the word out there to other collectors and just, what's out there, and what's real, and is-- is there any fakes going around. In a lot of senses, Richie was the number one spy for, uh, Pez USA No, I wasn't a spy. People thought I was the Pez police, but no, I really didn't tell them anything. Did he report back to Scott? Yes. Not a doubt in my brain. Scott McWhinnie absolutely had a reputation for kind of, "the Pez company hates collectors." And he's not a particularly likeable guy. He's a little pompous, he's a little full of himself, he's a little insecure. I was told by many people that-- that Scott McWhinnie had spies in the Pez world. That anything we would say would get back to him. [Bud] Scott was very aware of the growing collectors market. He was also very well-aware of the illegal activity going on in the collectors market. So, one of the first things we did to get information out to them, was we invited Richie Belyski up to the factory. He had a tour of the factory, um, he interviewed Scott for an hour or two, and we went to lunch. [Richie] It was interesting. It was the first time I was ever in there, and they don't give tours to people. ♪ [interviewer speaking] Um, yeah. Yeah, he did. He was sort of a little bit like a PR agency in a way. [Richie] That one's worth about $700. There's another sticker on the back. An original sticker. [man] Wow, that's terrific. Well, thank you, Richard. We appreciate it. We all love Pez, and now we know why. [Richie] I remember when I went to the Pez factory, Scott McWhinnie pulled one out of his pocket. He goes, "Hey, you see this dispenser? -You know what this is?" -And I said yeah. And he says, "Yeah, I'm gonna be sellin' it soon." [bubble pops] Bubble Man was designed by Scott McWhinnie. He loved it. Absolutely, [coughing] he was passionate about it. That was his. [cheerful music plays] He had the character developed and designed. Even went as far as having the name, um, registered. ♪ Um, and it was a project that Scott pretty much worked on himself. And I-- I think he-- he cared very much about it. ♪ [bubble pops] However, that project was put on hold. And when Scott heard that people were bringing Bubble Man over into the United States and selling them for an obscene amount of money, that burned him up. Most expensive one here right now is this guy here. And he's not old. He's from 1992. He's called the Bubble Gum Man. He's a prototype. Scott McWhinnie was watching, um, some news reel of a Pez convention, and he saw the Bubble Man. Some girl had one for sale. [woman] There's only about 20 known in the whole world. It was something they designed that they didn't have to pay licensing for. Manufactured a few, and looked at it and said, "what were we thinking when we made this?" -And that was the end of that. -It's butt ugly. -[woman] That's right. -[laughing] [John] And Scott McWhinnie had a fit. [woman] And right now his asking price is $1200. [reporter] Wow, $1200 for a Pez? That's amazing. [music intensifying] At this point, when Scott became aware of the-- the abuse that was going, the best way of killing that was to take those dispensers and put them into the direct marketing program, and sell it to all the collectors at a reasonable price. [Johann] Okay, this is Bubble Man. It's worth nothing. Everybody shouted, "Bubble Man! Bubble Man!" These are absolutely rare. They will not produce it. And then it-- then they produced it. Maybe actually on purpose to-- to-- to-- to damage the collector scene. The reason that anybody was willing to pay 1200 to begin with was because, at the time, they thought that there were less than ten. [Bud] I gotta tell you, when we put Bubble Man out there, it was insane the amount of orders we got. People want 'em, you know, for a $1.99. You got a $1200 dispenser. [laughing] So, it was like-- They've sold more Bubble Boy than any-- probably any damn dispenser ever, and it came out of Scott being so mad that he couldn't see straight, and ordering the product to stomp on us. You deal with the devil. And in all honesty, Scott McWhinnie was my arch-nemesis. Oh, I hated his guts. And that's when I decided to become the Pez Outlaw. [upbeat music playing] I needed a vessel. A person. I needed to build him. So that I can draw him in when I need him. I definitely viewed the whole thing as an adventure. The money, the travel, the quest. My goal from that point on was for accumulation. I needed the product so I could beat Scott. Every sale I could take away from Scott McWhinnie was a nail in his coffin. As the Pez Outlaw, ain't nothing stops me. I mean, for good or ill. [car horn honking] [Steve] I will win. I will win. In the end. At that point, we were going to Europe about every three or four weeks. And going to shows in between that. Sometimes even landing at shows and going directly to them. [cheerful music playing] [Josh] We had so much cash a-- after some of these conventions that, you know, you-- you did feel like a rock star. I had so much money that I was absolutely drunk. And ta-da, we have a basement. [Steve] But I mean, we bought a ton of things. We bought a new house. Well, guess what? Here's my house in the ditch. [Moriah] My mom really was able to have the freedom with them coming into a little more money to really pursue what she wanted to do. She went to schooling to become a therapeutic horseback riding instructor. [Kathy speaking] Steve had become nouveau riche at this point. His Pez market was booming. He was making tons of money, which he never had before. Hey, that's how I was doing things. I just-- talk to my bank. Do this, do that. He was so generous with his money, he paid his family and all his helpers well. I benefitted, 'cause I got to go to college without having to pay for any of it. It was magic. The whole time was magic. I won the lottery. Pez Outlaw was so dominant in the marketplace that Scott McWhinnie, the Pezident... He was losing. They advertised nothing. I had two full-page ads in one publication, a full-page ad in another publication... every month. He was blatantly advertising these things. There's the easiest way to find out. Steve was his own worst enemy. You know, put a billboard up, here I am, guys. Come after me. [laughing] So, it's like-- Well, you gotta remember, at the end of the day, Pez is a brand. It's a registered brand. You go over there on vacation, you bring back, you know, a dozen, yourself. You can sell them online. Nobody cares about that. When you start selling thousands of 'em, and you're running full-page ads... now you become a business. Scott took it very seriously, "I'm gonna protect my product, I'm gonna protect my brand. They're not gonna get away with that any longer. [crickets chirping] ♪ [Josh] After I couldn't go with him anymore, um, I wasn't scared for him, but I definitely was surprised, uh, that, you know, he was able to-- to go alone. [Steve] It was very nerve-wracking headin' off on my own. [Kathy speaking] I think his mental health, uh, state of mind, ex-drug persona, has to-- it-- it can't not play into paranoias. [ominous music playing] [car engine whirring] I learned to protect my space. [clock ticking] Getting off the highway, taking back roads. Totally paranoid. I saw people following me all the time. If I thought there was somebody behind me, man, I'd ditch 'em. [tires screeching] [David] He had things to be paranoid about. So, I would imagine that he didn't know who to trust. [Steve] Coming from the Midwest, I had never seen officials with machine guns. So, every border crossing was a threat. Not just the people with machine guns... [indistinct chatter] ...but the biggest nightmare would be losing the load. That mattered. -[dogs barking] -[man] [indistinct] Every bag out on to the blacktop. Every bag open. Every bag dumped. Could I have possibly gotten arrested? Yes. Would traps have been laid? Yes. Sometimes, all he really wanted was a bribe. I learned, if something happens of that nature... Hand out some money, you're done. Being that close to illegal, maybe illegal. Of course you're paranoid. [Bud] Scott never, ever went to Europe to go chase down Steve. So, there-- there's none of this, you know, Scott in a dark suit, you know, trying-- you know, hiding behind corners. You know, "I got you, Glew." You know? [laughing] There wasn't any of that drama. None of that ever existed. [Steve] Would Scott McWhinnie have tried to have people follow me? Yeah, he would've done that. In a heartbeat. But if they were following me, I did shake 'em. [music fades] [garage door whirring] Steve Glew was standing here. This was the place-- the place Steve Glew was waiting for me. I just decided to go visit Johann. I don't know how I had his address, where I got it, I have no idea, but I did. He came to me without appointment. He just was standing in front of my door. All of a sudden, a guy pulls up on a, uh... mo-- motorbike. And I said, "You are lucky, I am Johann Patek." And he said, "Oh, I am Steve Glew from America and I want to buy Pez." I just wanted to buy Pez. My answer was, "Oh, yes, let's do." Let's do some deals and I will show you something. I ask him to wait outside, and then I went in and brought him some Pez. [Steve] I had to sit on the curb outside this house he owned. While he went in and got the product. [Tina] Johann Patek. Yes. I do not know very much about him that I would tell. It's all very basic here. [Richie] Johann is a collector in Austria. You know, is this off the record? -[interviewer speaking] -Oh, okay. "What's in there?" I don't tell you. I will tell you later. There's not much to tell there. I mean, he's basically just been a competitor of mine. [Johann] And now, something dangerous will appear. Let me see. Uh. Hi, guys. Hands up, or I shoot you. [gun clicks] It's a genuine Pez shooter. Now, Zorro. Oho. I am fighting for the poor. I am taking the money from the rich. I am Zorro and I-- so everybody could recognize me, I have Zorro written on my stem. Otherwise, somebody would say, "I am a bank robber." [Tina] He knows everybody. But, yeah, he's a-- [interviewer speaking] Um... [laughing] He was in the right place at the right time. Steve happened in and kind of got in that territory. Um, and I don't know if they're friends. [Johann speaking] [interviewer] Can we go up there and film? -No. -[interviewer] No? -Okay, well, why not? -No. Because this will-- in-- affect my business. Oh, I have to... [slaps wood] ...be silent because I'm on a tape. I have no business. I never was a businessman. I always wanted to be part of the collectors game. [Steve] He just didn't want me to see. If people knew how much he actually had, like, if I had opened my mouth to the world that he had one bazillion... uh, the value would have plummeted. Then, all of a sudden, he wasn't interested anymore. Because he thought he-- he could get it for an apple and an egg. But this was not so, and so we parted our ways. He did not even know what he was doing. I mean, every dedicated collector is crazy a little bit in his mind. Because otherwise he would not be a collector. Collecting is, um, more or less a-- a disease. [saw whirring] [Steve] I think my symptoms of anxiety, depression, the highs, the lows, where you-- you-- the minute you've-- you get high, the immediate thought... is what you know is coming. The low. So, you don't even get to enjoy it. [melancholic music playing] [drill whirring] [Kathy speaks] [Steve] In my brain, I decided that what was going on-- well, I just made something up. [drill whirring] I have a very good... imagination, and... my heart is in creation. Hah! It's actually straight. [Kathy speaks] -[music fades] -[crickets chirping] [Steve speaking] [both laughing] [upbeat music playing] [Josh] By that time, I had my master's in business. And I'd always envisioned, you know, coming and working for my dad, uh, anyways. He had the momentum, he had the pockets, he had the mechanism in place. [Steve] We had six employees, Josh was on the team. And I continued my adventures as Pez Outlaw. I enjoyed messing with Scott McWhinnie. He'd go into boardrooms in Europe, screaming and yelling and calling everybody names. Here he is, some president of an international corporation. -I am Pez USA! I am-- -[Steve] And yet, I'm the number one thing on his mind? Oh, my God, I think I love you. We could've, um, sued him. Brought him to court. The time, the money, the frustration, to sue this guy. I have other ways I could do it for a lot less money. [tires screeching] [Steve] I doubt literally that people were following me. [interviewer speaking] Yeah, the Shadow. The Shadow was following him. [laughing] That's fun. That's fun. It ain't paranoid if it turns out to be true. [shutter clicks] [Bud] Scott would call his counterparts over in Europe and discuss these illegal dispensers that Steve was importing and selling, and about having a stop put to it, and the Europeans agreed to hire a private investigator to put an end to it. I don't know who that was, 'cause they're private. Did they find out anything? It-- it seemed like there was pieces of the puzzle that were hard to put together. I mean, I have my own personal theories... that... you know, I think that maybe there was some people with-- inside the company at the time that were doing things they shouldn't have been doing. [interviewer] Steve has told us that... Gunther Leitner was actually selling things under the table to him. No. I mean, my experience with Gunther, he was always an upstanding man. Upstanding businessman. Gunther was well-known in the Pez organization because he was in charge of the factories. You know, he was the-- the top guy, so... that-- that would be beneath him, to do that. [church bells tolling] ♪ -[Gunther] Dog, come here. -[dog barks] [Gunther speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer] David Welch? Do you know that name? [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [interviewer speaking] [Gunther speaking] [interviewer speaking] [foreboding music playing] [John] Steve Glew became so notorious... that even over there, they had pictures of Steve Glew in the factory. And Pez even decided, let's put video cameras here-- there-- there, 24/7 on the lines, so if somebody came in at night or whatever, we can see them. [VHS player clicking] [Steve] It was definitely a cat and mouse game between McWhinnie and I. -[banging] -I was a threat. [Bud] So, yes, there were meetings a-- amongst myself and Scott and other people within the company. But he was passionate about it. And-- and passionate that, you know, that he wanted 'em stopped. [Steve] I had to be very careful. Very careful. Where I went, how much exposure I gave myself. They just knew who I was. Everybody knew who I was. ♪ [planes whooshing past] On one of the last trips to Europe... it's like visiting this very special, wonderful place. And the door to the factory offices was wide open. And Gunther... [laughing] ...Gunther happened to be there. And he came running out of the offices into the parking lot, and he just goes, "You cannot be here! You cannot be here! I cannot be seen with you! I don't know you! I don't know you!" [Steve] After that, I knew I was persona non grata. And if I went near the place-- I mean, poor Marcos saw me and, you know, it's just, big hearted wonderful Marcos, who you love dearly. Won't look at you, won't say a word. They were afraid of me because I could get 'em fired. Um, they were afraid to lose their jobs. Every one of 'em. Even knowing me or saying they liked me could cost them their job and their livelihood. And eventually it did shut their factories down. [interviewer speaking] Uh, Kolinska turned into a... a ketchup factory, and soup. Ormoz turned into a dustpan factory. And, uh, I don't say it with a brag. But I accept responsibility for both being shut down because of me. [Bud] It had nothing to do with Steve Glew. There wasn't one decision made regarding a factory that had anything to do with Steve Glew. Zero. [chuckling] [Steve] I could see the writing on the wall. I was headin' down the tubes. Scott McWhinnie was winning at that point, because when you make it impossible for somebody to buy the thing that competes, you win. Yeah, it was deeply frustrating. I got the hell out of there and... it was just sad. -[cricket chirping] -[wistful music starts] Once I got home... there really wasn't room for old me anymore. Kathy's hands started twitching. And, uh, the Parkinson's started coming on. I can't do that. Not gonna do that. Not doing that. [interviewer speaking] [chuckling] The whole story's about her. I was busy. Being what I call Pez Outlaw, and doing what I needed to do to earn what I thought was being a man then. But I knew that I needed to be better. It's okay, you'll be all grown-up and spotted, and we'll show you these pictures. [Josh] As things became more difficult for my mom... he stepped up to a new level of being that I don't even think the closest people, you know, in our lives, would've ever expected to happen. Um... but that... that's how much he loves her. My mom. [hopeful music playing] [Steve] I used to think I had to ride a horse... to be the man she could love. She liked horses, so, "Ooh, I gotta be a cowboy." So, I tried to be a cow-- You ain't gotta be a cowboy. Be useful. Be decent. Be kind. Tell her you love her. [Kathy speaking] I went out and did this crazy thing because this crazy thing took care of my family. But if I was gonna continue with Pez, I realized that I had to take action. We gotta find other ways to do things. And that is what led to... the big decision. [Steve] Trying to find... There we go. [upbeat music starts] After buying all this product for so long, i-- it finally occurred to me, why don't I create my own? Um, I had a lot of good ideas, just like Marcos. He's gonna hate me for this. [laughing] Steve was very creative. He kept coming up with all these different interesting color variations like, um, crystal Pez with see-through heads. [David] If the order was, you know, large quantities, anyone can get anything directly from a factory. I decided to create my own designs. I'd named 'em the "Holiday Colors." The half million-dollar order was my attempt to come out of the shadows, and do business openly. I was trying to go legit. Yes, definitely I was trying to go legit. And not have to talk in code. And, uh, be able to say, "Yes, this is my product." -[buttons beeping] -[dial tone] I mortgaged my house. I took out a line of credit. -That got me 250 of it. -[cash register dings] And then, believe it or not, I had 250 cash. You know, we went from bringing it back in, uh, duffle bags, to importing it through a broker in Grand Rapids. And we were spending huge amounts of money. [upbeat electronica playing] They created all my product... in the name that it was going to, like, Taiwan. And Taiwan packaging. [whistling] Rerouted it to me. Legally. On paper, legally. I laid out the whole business plan, and... I could afford to pay just under five bucks per to have them made. And then sell 'em for 25 and be on a good profit margin. And I'd been assured that this was going to be exclusive to me. [dial tone beeping] And I have faxes of those assurances. [fax machine whirring] We were set. Half a million dollars was gonna turn into... a minimum of 2.5 million dollars. And then Christmas time rolls around, and I was just so excited.

And Scott McWhinnie, I'm not done yet. [upbeat music playing] We started selling it at conventions, I started selling it at toy shows. [Tina] Everybody wanted his colors. You know, he had five different stems of a yellow snowman and of the red snowman. You could only buy them from Steve. It was so different than what Pez was putting out. So, this is Pez's version of the skull. Right? So, this is his variation. You know, he did the black face with the yellow eyes. It just popped. It looked cool. Steve Glew had so many color variations of things, that I was in shock when I saw those all out at one table. [Steve] They were selling like a madman. And it was more than I could dream of. To have my own product line that I was proud of. And I was, I was extremely proud of it. That was the year that I did a million bucks. It was magic. Going legit had worked, but it was the briefest moment ever because, oh, man, did the shit hit the fan. [ominous music playing] [Tina] Steve and David Welch and I were walking from our rooms upstairs down to the convention floor. And we walked through the door, and the first thing we see is this huge display. [Bud] I had a job to do, and I executed the job. And the job was to help stop this. This is what Pez did with the Misfit. This is how they packaged it. To them, it was misfit, it was ugly. The ones that Steve had done were on Pez cards. They were made at the factory. They were on the-- a stripe candy card. But then when we walked into the ballroom that day, they were on a completely different card, and they were actually labeled on that card as Misfits. Scott came up with the name Misfits 'cause they didn't fit into the rest of the assortment. The Misfits were manufactured as a way to put him out of business. Where he was selling them for, say, 20, 25 dollars, we're selling them now for $1.99. [Steve] He sold for less than I paid to have it made. So, basically... pulled the gas right out of him. Scott used the marketplace. He used the market to-- to kill him. [Tina] The Pez company decided to put him out of business. Steve and David turned around and they went back to their room, and they never came back that day. [somber music playing] It was horrible. It was just horrible. They hurt him. They hurt him financially, really bad. [interviewer speaking] Yeah. Yeah. A little-- a little satisfaction. The man was broken that day. [Steve] I dropped my prices, pushed it out into the market as cheap as I had to. It didn't work. Worthless. [downhearted music plays] [Mike] I didn't realize how devastating it was to him, though, initially. This was right around the time my wife and I got married, and Steve was supposed to drive up from Michigan for our-- for our wedding. And, uh, he just was a no-show, and I didn't know why. We lost contact after that, and Steve stopped calling. I think he-- I think he stopped taking phone calls, too, because of what-- of what happened to him. [somber music playing] That's when he went into his-- his period of seclusion. Where he just, like, dropped off of the, uh, off of the map. [Kathy speaking] [Bud] You know, he just sort of went off the radar. Which is exactly what the plan was. [music fading] [Steve] I lost all my money and went $250,000 in debt. You know, you fight for-- to pay your bills. You damn near lose your house so many times it's tiresome. [melancholic music playing] [grunting] Josh had to slowly let go of all four of the employees, including my son-in-law. And his last job... was he fired himself. [Kathy speaking] [Steve] Yeah, I went through some pretty bad years. Financially and mentally. But I think that... the crash was important to find me. I had a decade of what I call a primal scream. Scott McWhinnie decided... that he finally had the way to kill me. And he was right. He did. Okay. [upbeat music playing] After the crash, the story was all I had left. And that's when I wrote my blog, Pez Outlaw Diary. You don't just create a product. You create a story. When Steve started writing his blogs... nobody knew any of that about him. [Mike] Steve feels that this is his legacy now. He wants people to know what happened. He wants the story to be out. It validates it. It says, "Yes, this happened." [Steve] I think everyone wants to be remembered in life. They wanna make their mark. And they wanna get it right. At least once. Honest to God, if it wasn't for Pez Outlaw, nobody would remember Scott McWhinnie. He's a plot point in my story. If I can get this character of Pez Outlaw... deeply ingrained enough into the history of Pez, then... that will be enough. It's a good story. It's a good story. [cheerful music] [people shouting joyfully] [Tina] It was 20 years before I saw Steve again. And he swore he'd never go to another convention. I said, "Steve, everybody wants to know about you, Steve. Everybody wants to hear your story." [Richie] Nowadays, I think that, you know, with all the new collectors coming into the hobby, they-- they don't know of the backstory. They don't know-- they weren't there when it happened, and... [Jim] For a guy like me who wants to collect everything Pez, his history was-- was part of the influence of-- of even why I collected. [audience cheering] [John] Steve Glew was a featured person at the convention, and he hadn't been heard from for years. And I mean, there was many, many, many people that wanted his signature. He definitely has a great cult following. [Jim] He-- he was just this... I don't know, Pez God. [laughing] I mean, how-- how else do you say it? [David] I think everyone wants someone just to say, "I see what happened to you and it-- and it matters." It's-- it's a huge thing to find out that you're not alone. [Steve] Everybody wants their story told. Everybody wants to be remembered. The story of Pez Outlaw is an act out of my mental issues. Learning to cope with anxiety, depression... and... the voices in your head, so to speak. And in some cases, some of the things that you have are actually tools. They are not burdens. Honestly, I think his story is good, and it's fun, but I think the human side of Pez Outlaw is way more valuable. I can be who I am and be miserable... or I can be who I am... and try and find the good in it. And if you're lucky, like me, you married your therapist. [Kathy speaking] [Steve] She's been everything to me. Everything. [music fades] [Johann] I hope you have success. I wish-- I wish you-- because you're very sympathetic man. But I think you picked the wrong topic. That's my impression. Let's see... if you-- if you also have to take out a mortgage for your house. Then I-- I-- I-- I keep right. You picked the wrong person.
