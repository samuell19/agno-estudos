He's a handsome guy, l wish he weren't deaf. Has he ever called you? Zeynep receives voiceless calls, they say. Oh, you are vey disgusting. Towards the windows... l opened up myself... Amidst time, l left my soul... lt's easy to die, Close the doors! Living in loneliness, no hope. l'm afraid oflove l'm afraid ofdeath l'm afraid of passers-by l'm afraid ofwords unspoken Hello Just look at me while talking. l think you were leaving, did l disturb...

Oh that's it, l'll ty. You don't have to do anything. Do you think l am here because l feel myselfbad? Do you say eveything you think? Who are you tying to protect, me or yourself? Are you afraid?

Shall l ask you what to call you for, my girl... answer me, is Zeynep there? Probably she hasn't come. She hasn't come? What do you mean? Cousin, it is none ofyour business, you got separated, Ieave her alone. ln the meantime don't forget to call aunh. Today is her birthday. Don't poke your nose into eveything. Good morning, love. Who the hell are you? Each person speaks in one's own language and no one understands a word the light in the mind utters. l haven't had such a breakfast for months. l haven't had such a breakfast for months. By the way, where do you know Vedat from? Right, he rows, too. Did you study cih-planning, too? Graphic design. Where do you work? ln the libray? l'm working in the call center. Have a nice day, this is Zeynep, how can l help you? l'm late forwork. l have to leave. Thanks a lot for the breakfast, see you. By the way, l made an appointmentwith Leyla for this evening, would you like to come? Leyla is my housemate. Right, l'll call you after l leave work then, okay? l'll send you a message, ok. Ohh... sory! Bye bye. Aras has reserved tickets for all of us for the concert. Zeynep, he has bought one foryou, too, You can't turn it down this time, we're going. l'm working hard, let me not promise. Even coming here was diMcult. : Stop whining, you are coming, Zeynep, my dear. Do you remember the festival we went to last summer? We stayed there with Zeynep after you returned. One night, we were sleeping in a tent, it rained all night continuously until morning, ...everwhere was muddy, we wanted to go to the toilet, a queue often meters, like this. My girl, you insisted on staying in the tent. l know, butwe had great fun. We really had drunk a Iot, don'tyou remember? l don't remember a concert orwhatever. Itwas diMcult for us even to find the way to the tent. l tried real hard until l could make her go to sleep. She was talking continuously, ''l want to go to the toilet'', ...l can't breathe, l feel thirsh... l don't remember any ofthat. Of course you wouldn't remember, you shouldn't have drunk so much. We woke up in the morning, with blasting music next to my ear. Ofcourse she closed the window - We're in the tent l'm saying - l know After thatyou called me morning, Do you remember? Did you answer? You didn't, l hanged up, He'll call in the morning... music is on... l know he'll say he wants to come.. l have to leave early Breakfast is ready...See you Rent,Electricih, Apartment Expenses, Water... l say Kamuran,... Why don't you collect the rents from now on. Let me not deal with it. And look, let's not increase Onur's rent. He has fallen in love, now a lot ofexpenses. What would you say? What an excuse! l wantyou to listen to me for a second. Because ofthe demonstration you made a few days ago, in order to compensate for the loss caused to our company, those who didn'tjoin the demonstration will pay the same cost as those who joined it. All nextweek long, you will all do overtime. l hope, it's worth it. ''Shall we go to the movies?'' Where are we going? Why did we come up here? We couldn't talk for quite a long time. You don't tell me anything. What shall l tell you, fine. Words come out ofyour mouth with diMculh. l wonder ifyou've fallen in love, you're grinning at eveything. Oh, come offit, what love? Ladies, your break is over. Each passing second comes out ofyour pocket. Come on, back to the telephones. Mr. Aras, you know, Tamer's foot has been broken. He won't be able to come to work for a week. l left the report on your table. A week? Only then he will be able to walk. We'll take him from home, nothing will happen. Girls, we're not having a match on an Astro pitch. He'll sit and work with his hand and mouth, that's all. Looking into our mirrors smiling, we're opening the telephones. Now, we are giving a strong applause to ourselves for the big turnover today. Yes, thanks. - Your orders. - Give them. You give me the money first. You bastard, if l catch you... You'll dream ofit, you first come out to the front ofthe door. Son ofa bitch! l came here suddenlywithout notice, but this did not push you into a diMcult situation, did it? Afterwork, l didn't want to go home alone. l just got it today, they say it's a vey beautiful film. Maybe tonight before falling to sleep, we can finish a film. You know, l getvey tired... ...probably l snore at nights You mean, it's not a problem. Don'tyou get it?,... ...l say l'll come in halfan hour.... Will you be a bit quiet, my friend,... ...look eveyone's studying. Hey, why do you interfere? Mind your own business. No, my love, l'm not telling you. Man, what are you doing? Hey Kamuran, look at them, how sweet they are. What? Will you say something? No, l won't say anything. Aras calling Missed Call Opening message l missed you Delete message? These flowers came to you. They gave them to me while coming upstairs. Thanks. The director said Zeynep should see him before leaving. Allright. ''Can we make up now?'' Zeynep, what happened again? Why did he call you? So to speak, my break time is long... ...,he brought the conversation to the demonstration and tried to find out who had organized it. They are just doing whatever they want and we don't react to anything. My dear, the men say, ''ifit suits your book'', as simple as that. But it does not... Then they show the door. Why are we going, do you know how many times l've changedjobs. This is our problem, we're running awaywhen it comes to the crunch. Whatwill we do then? ln my opinion, we can take some risk. Yes. Let's write to newspapers, or else go to unions,... ...lsn't there a union related to ourwork? There must be but it is something overyour and my head. Then, let's set up a group at the Internet first,... ...This waywe will be evaluating people's reactions... ...Then we can get in touch with the other call centers. Yes, this is a vey good idea. l mean, let's start from somewhere. l'll get offat the square. We'll talk tomorrow, okey? Many thanks. lt's related to work, not important. There is nothing to say, l'm working like mad all day. How was your day? Onur, look, what a nicejob you have. lfyou prepare a web page you'll earn many many times ofthe moneyyou make at the libray in a month. l'm not faulh. There is something wrong with the adjustment of the oarlock. The oar came out ofits place while rowing. You could continue with one oar. What happened to your hearing aid? l bought it at Gaes. It's waterproof. l see. Guys, let's stop makingjokes. We have to get ahead ofthe big team. How shall we do it? The men are vey strong. This doesn't have anything to do with strength. We have to work harder. Right. We can do it ifwe believe. l'll tell you a big secret, l'm afraid ofyou. What is that mean? What did you do with the photographs? l've just transferred them to the computer but l'll send them this week. - Promise? - Promise, l'll send them. Good, right. How are the lessons? l getyour news. Good, good, l'm studying. Probably going on well with our man. Eveyone said itwould end but you made a big surprise. Aa, what happened now? lt is as ifyou never talk about the lovers ofyour friends. Okay, but this is more ofa gossip than conversation. Tell the curious ones Onur and l get along veywell with each other. Actually, l don't get together with them because of their silly, stupid behaviour. We can't talk about anything with you. Ok, bye. Let's go. Nothing happened, l just wanted to leave. No, no, there is nothing, let's go. Welcome, my boy. Have you lost some weight? A little. Zeynep. Welcome Zeynep, how are you? She doesn't know sign language. l'm so sory. l... lt's not important at all. Let me take these to the kitchen. Your mother is vey beautiful My mother. Zeynep, you didn't eat anything. No, l ate too much, in fact. You sit down, l will serve. - l don'twant to putyou into trouble. - Why should it put me into trouble? Mom, did you like Zeynep? l did. Don't get angy right away. l'm thinking ofyou. l don'twantyou to feel sory. Do her parents know aboutyou? How old was Onur in that photograph? What did she ask? Your age in the photograph. Three. Wait a minute. Let me bring the photograph album. My head is ringing. Hello, Onur. Shall l make tea or... No, no thank you. They're waiting downstairs. l won't be able to stay long. l couldn't show patience and came over here to tell you. The toy company my brother is working for is Iooking for someone to have a web-site made. l thought of Onur. l told this to my brother and he spoke with those in the company and they said okay. This is great. Onur, you'll do it, won'tyou? i would but no time i work all day Perhaps you can take a leave, right? Not this week we'll have new books. Ty it once. Maybe you'll get rid of that boring place. You think l haven't tried they'll understand l can't hear and theywon'twork with me. Onur, my brother talked, there won't be any problems. Eveything is OK Onur,you see, no problem. l'm sory but they're waiting downstairs, l have to leave. Onur, you consider that, you'll let me know. Bye Why are you behaving this way, you did wrong to her. l justwanted to help you so that you could do your own business. What ifyou ty to get leave? l want to take my annual leave, l kindly submit it for necessay action. You sign it, l'll send it to the Personnel head-oMce. Good morning, good morning. l love you a lot. l'm afraid ofyou. Thank you. Please. Good night. ltwas great. But... but it was going to be a surprise. Ma'am, ma'am, butyou're not listening to me. No Ma'am, ofcourse itwon't work ifdon't plug it in. Look, you have to wash the cooking unit in. No, Ma'am, l don't think you can't cook stufFed pepper in deep fyer. l don't know it in fact. Look, l'm tying to explain for ten minutes, butyou're not listening to me. Ifyou don't listen,... ...how can l help you, Ma'am? Look, l'll putyou through to another friend ofmine,... ...he'll help you, please stay on the line. Ah, l can't do it. l can't do thisjob. Either these people are abnormal or l am a bit strange. l'll go crazy here. l can't explain. Either l can't express myself... Allright, give a five-minute break, that's it. Come on, come on, come on. l'll go nuts here. Right. We're going on friends, going on. Let's not lose our motivation. Go on, go on. Wov! l'm learning sign language. ls he worth this effort, l wonder? l would do such a thing probablyjust foryou. And l'm doing it for him. Chats within the breaks friends. Let's go on. l liked it a lot. l didn't know there was such a place. Where is your Mom? ln the kitchen, she'll come right away. Welcome! Hello! Whatwould you like to drink? Do you want lemonade? Allright. You, lemonade, too? Lemonade is my secret recipe. Onur likes it a lot. Have youjust had your hair cut? lt's nice. l'm bringing it now. Welcome, Zeynep. Thank you. How are you? l'mjust rushing around. How is eveything going? A little hectic. You are working at a Call Center, aren'tyou? Yes, l startedjust a few months ago. Are you content with it then? Not really but l'm not considering leaving either. After all It's vey diMcult to find ajob these days. Right. l'm going to the toilet Sure, nothing happens without spending effort. For instance, l had opened this place for Onur but he neverwanted to work here. He wants to show he can stand on his own feet. This understanding behavior ofyours towards him is so nice. l assume you've started to learn sign language. lt is different, isn't it? It looks entertaining when you look at it from out. You surely feel enthusiastic at the beginning but it fades away later. l don't think itwill be like that in my case. l hope so. Look, ifyou repeatwhat he tells you while talking, he'll see that you understand him, and this can encourage him to talk. Allright! Onur, come again, l miss you. ls this Elifyour old girl-friend? What's all that intimacy then? The girl knows even your hairdo. l'm sure there was something in bemeen you and this girl, l understand. Probably you think l'm stupid. ''Look at me while talking.'' Friends, our turnover today is a little low. A bit more motivation, let's not get demoralized. We are a good team. The more you sell, the more you earn, friends. The more you sell, the more you earn, don't forget. Now, we are looking into our mirrors with smiling faces, answering the telephones and attacking. Attack, friends. The more you sell, the more you earn. Come on. We are answering with smiling faces. That's enough, enough. Enough, l can't stand it anymore. That's enough, do they think we are slaves. l can't stand it anymore. Ok, friends, ok. Nothing's wrong. My ear can't hear any longer. Enough. Eylem, allright, calm down. Allright friends, go back to yourwork. There is no problem. She is just a bit nervous. Cologne, anyone has got cologne here? Ok, nothing wrong. Nothing to exaggerate. Friends, don't panic, take her out for five minutes. Let her take some fresh air, she'll feel better. Go back to yourwork, friends. Eveybody, please do not leave yourwork. Do not lose your motivation. Continue, there's nothing wrong. Allright friends, you go back to yourwork, come on. Okay, let her take some fresh air, she'll feel better. Yes, let eveybody go back to work. Let us not lose our motivation. Go on friends, go on, go on. What are you doing? l'm increasing the motivation, that's myjob, my superiors force me. You can't motivate anyone like this. Aren't you aware? Eveyone hates you. Pay attention to the people a bit, ty to understand us. You work here, too. This is a work place Zeynep, don't take it personally. This is the system, the one who wants to earn moneyworks, the one who doesn't leaves. Take your seats please. Yes, let us not lose our motivation, okay, we're going on. We shouldn't get demoralized. How come? He humiliated us all. And eveyone went back to their places and workedjust like sheep. See, eveyone is not the same. They'll also see it isn't, in course oftime. You'll see. l don't know how long more l can stand like this! How is it going with Zeynep? Great. You'rejust a chip ofthe old block. Don't tell me about my father. My dear, there isn't anything to be angy about. You found a girl and forgot me. You don't come and visit me. My father did not Ieave us for a woman. Don't start blaming yourself again. Your father left us for a woman. lt has nothing to do with you. How do you get along with Zeynep? Don'tyou still speak? My son, you studied, worked hard and struggled so much to speak. l'm fine like this. No one looks at me pihing. ln any case no one looks at pihing. You shouldn't be ashamed, let them be ashamed. Look, speak whenever you want to say something. lf Zeynep really loves you, she'll support you, she won't be ashamed ofyou. l have to go. Zeynep has forgotten her key. I Sister Sister, sister What's up? What's happening? Sister, come, look down, let her not sit in the road all alone at this time. What're you saying Kamuran? Sister, l'm telling you ''Please go! Sister go, look down'' Who, Kamuran? Go and look, roads are dangerous at this time. Ok, ok dear, come, sit, l'm coming. Please sister, come down, please. Sister, please come down. Zeynep, are you ok? Where's Onur? No problem. Onur hasn't come yet, so l got locked out. Come on, let's go up. l'll make coffee, too. Kamuran, my dear, calm down. Look, Zeynep is great, come on. You take a seat too, l'll make the coffee and come back. Allright? you're never to leave that girl out in the road all alone... ...at that time ofthe night again, do you understand? Do you get it? Do you get it? Kamuran calm down a bit. Hey, do you get it? Do you get it? Do you get it? Kamuran, what're you doing? Do you understand me? - Please don't. - Do you understand me? Kamuran, come on. Come on, get calm. Leave me. Okay, you please go to the living room. l beg you. Kamuran gave me a big supportwhen my husband died. Eveything would get better when my dear AslI joined us. Kamuran got engaged before going to the army. My dearAslI waited for him. She made the preparations for the wedding. One day, AslI was in our home for dinner. What meals l had cooked, you should've seen the table. Anyway. Kamuran left to take Asli back home. Then l fell asleep in the armchair while waiting for him. l woke up with the ringing ofthe telephone. While AslI and Kamuran were walking in the road mo man had stopped them and asked for money. When Kamuran put his hand into his pocket to take the wallet out,... ...one ofthe men thought itwas a knife,... ...and stabbed him with the knife in his hand. Kamuran, got wounded on his leg and fell down,... ...when my dearAslI interfered to protect him,... ...and that's when it happened. Kamuran did not say a word the first month, they said major depression,... ...lots ofmedicine so forth, l thought he was recovering slowly, but thatwasn't it. After he came back from the hospital, he never left home. This is why he's so nervous tonight. l am so sory. He got real worried when he saw Zeynep all alone downstairs. Well, were those men caught? One was caught that night. And the other one hasjust been caught. Just? Yeah, a paper arrived from the court. They are calling Kamuran for confrontation. Will he go? l haven't told him yet. What ifthat casts him down again? What ifsomething worse happens? ln my opinion, you should tell him, perhaps he'll go. l don't think so. Then, water doesn't clean anything when you are so dirh... ...don't ty in vain... ...only a handful ofblood to clean you... ...the blood flowing from your chest to your palm... The temperature in Istanbul is 30 degrees tomorrow,... ...however, because of the high humidih, the weather can be a bit sulty. Long live my tutor. Cihan taught it. You mean, you studied in secret. Are you angy? ''Aras calling'' You see, this club provides all our needs,... ...not a penny comes out ofour pockets, what's their expectation in return? To do ourwork properly and find a place in the team. lfthere is no sufFering, there's no success. ''Your Break is Over'' Yes, l think itwould be great. l'vejust come to Onur. Allright, l'll tell them. See you. You know, eveybody atwork is talking only about our site for a week. They also learned you made it. They're vey curious aboutyou. This site served its function. You saw who supports and who doesn't. - Would you like to drink tea? - Ok. l missed you a lot all day. l'm thinking ofwhat to wear to work tomorrow. Halfofmy things are there and halfhere. Why don't you move here? Move? Here? Shall we live together? Don'tyou want to? No, it's not that l don'twant to but... Then, let's go and getyour things But l need to talk to Leyla... We'll settle it later. Let me take a few ofmy things today,... we can come and pack the rest tomorrow. Allright? l'll be right back. Girls, we're arguing just for nothing, l see Zeynep at work eveyday,... l know what her problem is. The ladywants a change. And she'sjust being stubborn. lfthis is a change at all? She could go on a holiday then. l agree. That afFair can't go on anyway, it'll finish soon. Any one who wants to drink something? l'll help... What's up Zeynep? l don'twant to interfere, l'vejust come to pack my things. What do you mean ''pack my things''? l'm moving to Onur's place. Zeynep, you did go real nuts Zeynep... lt's none ofyour business. My girl, at leastwe could talk about it.... What's happening? Zeynep is moving. Have you thoroughly thought about it? There's nothing to think about. There is, Zeynep, my dear. Because you don't know what you're doing. And how can you leave me so abruptly. Zeynep, don't move all together? Look, you're only at the start ofthe road, l know you veywell. l've been your friend for so manyyears. Don'tyou see the consequence ofthis afFair? Are you aware ofwhat people are saying behind your back? l know it all but l don't care at all. Onur is waiting for me. l think you should care. Let's sayyou don't mind us, think ofyour mother, your father. How will they feel when they learn Onur's situation. Stop it Leyla. Oh, sory. l'm your friend. l'm telling this for your own good. Leyla? Which afFair of yours did l interfere so far? Why are you interfering? l haven't had a single abnormal afFair, Zeynep. Let's put them back, go in and sit. This is whatyou think ofa normal afFair and how you look at people Come here. Onur! Onur! Zeynep fainted, come here, quick. You see, ifsomething happens to you, he won't know it. Is this normal? l'll come later to get the rest ofmy things. Why aren't you answering my messages, my girl? What message? Leave it, Aras. l won't. Stop, we should talk. - Give it ! - Why do you hury, stop, let's talk! Hey, what's up? What's wrong with you? Fuck you! Onur calm down! Aras, Aras, ?ome here! Hey, don't bellow, don't bellow.

No more exploitations, no more exploitations at the call center! Who is in charge of this demonstration? lt's me. We're tying to publicize our problems. Ok, you did it, now disperse. We'll disperse anyway after reading the press release. Ma'am, this demonstration is against Iaw on meetings and demonstrations,... ...ifyou don't disperse, the police will have to interfere. Fine, Sir, butwe're saying... ...we'll disperse after walking and reading out the press release. Sir, don't you understand my words? Your demonstration is illegal, l say. lfyou don't disperse, we'll have to interfere. Ok, but, you also know we don't need permission for this press release. Butyou don't have the right to walk. No, there is no such clause in the law. Then, do it carefully. Bring the pancards down, take this, you leave that. Onur, don't. Pressures can't discourage us, pressures can't discourage us. What are you doing, you, without understanding, without listening? You threw so manyweeks' work into the garbage. The men had given us permission, you screwed eveything up. l'm fed up with your nervous attitude, fed up, fed up... Ok, ok, ok, ok. Go, go. Sir, Chief-lnspector Adnan has arrived. With your permission. What did you do, my girl? Why do you make us feel sory like this? What did l do, Mom, we wanted to get our rights, we anyhow had the permission. No, no, l'm not talking about it, my dear, you have an afFairwith a deafand dumb guy... ...the oMcer told me. Is that right? Don't drive me crazy Zeynep, answer me. For God's sake my girl, weren'twe able to give you whatyou needed? Now, you are with a disabled man. What are you saying? Onur isn't disabled, it's you who is so actually. Look at me, don't be rude! You, arrogant! Salih, please! For God's sake! Don't do it! Come on, we're going. l'm not coming anywhere with you. Come on, l tell you, we're going home. Behave yourself. Salih, you go out and take some fresh air. Zeynep will recover in the meantime, then we'll go home. Com'on my dear. Don't drive your dad so mad. Mom, l won't come with you, l'll wait for Onur here. Don'twory, they let him go. How come? l don't know how, he's gone. ls Onur gone? Zeynep, come on, my girl. l'm not coming. Look, don't irritate me anymore, get in that car. Don't... Zeynep! My girl. Look, do you see, she's gone. The mother and father have taken her... You did this eventually, this was the last thing you hadn't done - attack a policeman. l'm not guilh. What do you mean ''l'm not guilh''? What else would it be? l was tying to protect Zeynep. Now, did you protect Zeynep? Look, l have a son and l can't stand to lose him. Pull yourselftogether. Look what you've done. You don't know a thing, and you talk. l talk knowing nothing, do l? Ofcourse, it's always you who knows what's right, we haven't lived at all. Cut it out. We won't and we'll solve the problem together. What problem? The problem is this. l told you you couldn't get along, butyou didn't listen to me. We get along well. Ofcourse, dear, it is obvious you get along well. You've faced all this because ofher. The employees at the call center is none ofyour business. We give support to each other. Support? What kind of support to each other? You got arrested. Ok, Mom. Don't say Ok. You keep on putting the blame on yourself, just like at other times. Ok, stop talking. l won't stop talking. lt's time you faced certain things. Grow up, it's enough, grow up! Don't talk, that's enough. l don'twant it. Don't talk. l fell in love. Don't interfere with me! Ok. l'm sory. l don'twantyou and me to feel sory anymore. Stop getting angy with yourself and me. You're doing exactly the same thing as my father did to me. l am sory for this. What am l doing to you? l'mjust tying to protectyou. No. My fatherwanted to keep me away from other people because he was ashamed ofme,... ...,you're keeping the people away from me because you're afraid. No... Right, he was ashamed. He felt offended... ...My father got ashamed of the strange sounds l produced while... ...tying to talk near my father's friends. Please... Why didn't he ever take me to my grandmother and my grandfather? Why? He didn't take me as his son,... ...he always looked at me badly and strangely,... ...Do you think l didn't feel it? l know. But l didn'twant to lose your father. l always wished he would see his fault one day. That man did notwant me to talk... l kept silent so that people wouldn't look at me as he did. l was always afraid,... ...ifmy father looks at me thatway,... ...how would the others look, l thought. l don'twant to get afraid anymore. Come on, let's go. What's up? Some ofthose whojoined the demonstration were fired. Didn't you talk with Aras? Didn't help. Decision was taken last night. Take it easy, we weren't happy here anyway, we'll find something new. Zeynep, my dear, you don't need to look for anything. Aras hasn't touched you. What are you saying? He fired the last ten people in the Sales Department to threaten others. He can fire neitheryou, nor me. This is exactlywhat it is. Friends, today ten people have been fired. And l am resigning this moment. We had the demonstration to improve the working conditions. lfour punishment is getting fired,... then we should all stand behind whatwe've done... ...Only then can we change certain things. Because what is important is us in those boxes, we should realize it. They can't fire us all because ...they can't replace us in a week That's why we're being punished with the firing of ten of our friends. Let us not limit ourselves with yesterday's demonstration, let's keep on struggling. Ok, now let's give an applause to ourselves. Bring the cup here ... 1,2,3, Cim Bom Bom. Righteous l thought. Liar l chased To me lacking Faith l traced No hope have l At each step l take Desperate Dreams l chased My sorrows haunt me As ifalways... l wentwrong l talked with my parents, you can stay as long as you want to. l'm sure there's nobody over there at this time. l have to go and get my things from Onur's place when he isn't at home. Close the doors! Never open up yourself lt's easy To force to love lt's hard to die Patient l am Fearless l am ls life so diMcult? Shall we be sent offfrom the game lfwe are different? Need a pretext, Need an excuse? What a shame. What a shame. A taxi to Hayat sokak, No: 35. Did l leave myjacket here? The End
