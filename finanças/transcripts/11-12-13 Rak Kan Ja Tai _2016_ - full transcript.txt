[radio announcer 1] Good evening, today's April the tenth, our last working day before the Songkran Festival holiday begins. People have already hit the road on their journey back home. [announcer 2] A large number of people are making a trip home for the Songkran holiday. Many are going upcountry to celebrate the Thai New Year. [announcer 1] Let's take a look at how the festivity is shaping up. Travelers and foreign tourists have arrived in many places. The celebration of our water festival is going to be as lively as it is every year. [announcer 2] Now let me wish you a very happy Thai New Year. May all of you have a safe and joyful Songkran celebration. What's all this splashing? [Tar] I told you we should stay away for a while. This is too much. It's killing me! See, you're not pregnant. Som, don't pull this trick on me. We're not going to make it. [sobbing] Tar, I'm sorry. I don't want you to leave me. I want to break up. [sobbing] Tar! Don't go! If you leave me... [sniffles] I'll kill myself. [Som continues sobbing] I love you. What did I do wrong? Tell me and I'll make it better. Give me another chance. Please love me like you once did. Why don't you come back! -Come back to me. -[dance music playing] The bitch won't leave me in peace. Hey, I haven't seen you in ages. I've been busy with work. With work or with girls? Nothing like that. -So... -So? So will you come with me later? -Are you serious? -Of course. [giggling] [cell phone chimes repeatedly] [sighs impatiently] Excuse me. [clicks tongue] Damn it! Drama queen. [sighs] [inhales sharply] [sobbing] Asshole, you've fucked me enough and now you're dumping me. Why do you have to be so rude? That's it. I'm leaving you. No, I won't let you. -I won't let you leave. -[grunts] I won't! If you leave... I'll kill myself. I won't let you leave! Go on, I'm sick of your empty threat. [Som sobbing] Tar, fuck you. Som! Fuck! Shit! [Som] I won't let you. [gasps] [Som sobbing] [sobbing] Som. I won't let you break up with me. Don't do it! No! Som... No... No! [gasps] [Som] Tar... I won't let you. [Tar yells] [breathing heavily] [object clatters] [gasps] [whimpering] [continues breathing heavily] [gasping] What the hell! Shit! [sobbing] What the hell is this mess? This is so fucked up! [screams] Shit! Get off me! Bitch! Get your hands off me! -Let me go! -[Som grunting] [gasps] [whimpering] [breathing heavily] [inhales sharply] [grunting] [sniffing] [retching] [voice calling from distance] [voice calling from distance] [engine starts] [tires squealing] Just my luck. [police] Good evening. Have you been drinking? -Not a drop, officer. -I'll have to check you. [blowing] [device beeps] You're good. Where're you headed? Home, in Chanthaburi. Really? That's my hometown, too. -[banging] -[Tar gasps] Open the trunk, please. Hey, open the trunk. [officer, knocking] Hey! Can't you hear me? I said open the trunk! -[brakes squeal] -[crashing] [alarm blaring] [bells jangling] [sighs] [sighs heavily] [grunts] [gasping] [choking] [retching] [vomiting] [breathes heavily] [Som] Tar... [gasps] I won't let you leave. [bones creaking] No! Don't come near me! [Tar breathing heavily] Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! [whimpering] Don't! Don't! Don't! -[knocking at window] -[gasping] Hey. Are you all right? Your change. ♪ Morning News Hours ♪ [female reporter] As usual, the crowds are heading upcountry during the long holiday. The splashing has already started, and pretty soon we're going to get real wet. Traffic on major highways isn't as bad as expected because many drivers left the city before the holiday began. -[brakes screeching] -[horns honking] [women cheering] [brakes screeching] [tires squealing] [gasps] [brakes screeching] [bones creaking] [screaming] [horn honking] [heart monitor beeping] [groans] [bubbling] [creaking] [gasps] [creaking continues] [breath trembles] [breathing heavily] -[Som] You can't leave me! -[gasps] Damn it. [groans] Shit! My goddamned arm... [groans heavily] [exhales] [gasps] [Som screaming] [breathing heavily] [grunting] [Som] Tar... I won't quit you. Som! I won't! [bones creaking] [gasps] [groaning] [straining] [screams] [gurney rattling] [Tar grunts] [breathing heavily] [metal squeaking] [exclaiming] What is this mess? I won't fucking leave. [exclaiming] Tar! [screams] [whimpering] [continues screaming] [grunting] [grunts] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [screams] [metal squeaking] [gasps] [coughing] [breathing heavily] [Som] Tar! [exclaiming] I won't! [whimpering] Som! [gasps] [exclaims] Som. Please. Just leave me in peace. I won't. Don't... Get away from me! [bones creaking] [panting] Tar! Help me please! Get off me! Get your hands off me! Let me go! [grunting] Bitch! [gasps] [retching] [gasps] Som, I'm sorry. [gurney rattling] [screaming] [bubbling] [brakes screeching] [screaming] [shrieking] [screaming] -[crickets chirping] -[dogs barking distantly] [leaves rustling] [whimpering] [voice snarls] [dogs barking] You hear that? God damn it! I'm outta here! What the... Shit! Me too! Coward! [wind howling] [whimpering] Shit! No! Holy crap! Shit, no! No! [laughing] [Den] Cut! [all laughing] [Den] Dickhead, why are you laughing? Can't you see? He's crushing my balls! The prick! You suck. You were supposed to let Kay run away first. My character's scared, so I ran. You idiots should take this seriously. It's Songkran but I didn't get to go home or party. And you guys treat this as a joke. It's not funny! Morons! I work my ass off editing our movie while you monkey around. Don't blame us. We'll help you. [dialogue inaudible] -[all exclaiming] -Staring, staring! Ouch! Gotta hit me so hard? Yes, I'm annoyed. -Make a move, will you? -Right. -Go chat her up. -Right. -A dog looking at a bone. -Right. None of your business. -Right. -Right what? [Kay] Get moving. Go! -[Odd] Don't push me! -Go on! [Kay on video] Shit, I'm outta here. Mod, come look at this. -It's so cool. -What? Your shadow, it's headless. [laughs] Cut again? Why? [Den] You're holding the flashlight in the wrong hand. It doesn't matter! It's the camera angle. Angle, my ass. Look. Kay, Odd, come look at this. Mod's shadow has no head. What? I'll show you. Right! Awesome! Hey... That's a bad omen. [Kay] What omen? Seriously. A headless shadow means your time is over. Odd... That's bullshit. It's just the camera angle. Look. It looks real. Right. [dog barking] -Headless for sure. -Yeah. Nah, a trick of light. You photoshopped it? It's a raw file. Wait... Who's that? It's Ning. Yeah. Make your move. Hey, Mod. This is your chance. You snooze, you lose! -Smartass! -[laughing] -Go. -Go! Go on! Be a man! Uh, hello. What're you doing here all alone at this hour? The street's so dark. I'm too scared to walk by myself. No more motorcycle taxi. What're you going to do? I've just called my friend to come pick me up. She's in the shower, but told me to wait. Got her number? She's waiting for her friend to come pick her up. Tell her you'll walk with her! I'll walk with you. I don't want to trouble you. She doesn't want to trouble me. Huh. It's all right. Our place is at the end of the street. I can walk with you, we have to go in anyway. She'll call her friend first. C'mon! Why do you have to report to us? Do what you have to do! Moron! Dumbass! Go on! [boys chattering and giggling] Look at their hands! [mimics moaning] [all laugh] [boys continue chattering indistinctly] [Odd] Shit, a headless ghost. I... I'll go back to the editing studio. [whimpering] I'll go help him. I... [footsteps approaching] Young man, is the bus still running? My grandson's sick, I'm taking him to a hospital. [sighs] Ning. I'm not sure. You have to ask again at the main road. [brakes screeching] [tires squealing] [all shriek] [screaming] [brakes screeching] [tires squealing] [brakes screeching] [crashing] In the old days, people believed that spirits would return to this world. Let's hear more from our expert. In three or, at most, seven days, the spirits of the dead will return. [man 1] In three days to seven days? And why do they come back? [man 2] To settle their unfinished business. They'd come back for love or for revenge. To reclaim what's theirs, or to resolve issues. Or maybe they just want to say goodbye. [man 1] From what I've heard, when dogs sense the presence of a spirit they'd let out a long howl, then you'd feel a faint breeze. Or sometimes a sudden gush of wind. You'd feel a chill. Your hair would stand up for no reason. Is it true? -[man 2] It is. -I see. [dogs howling] [whooshing] [knocking at door] [softly] Who's that? [knocking continues] Faint breeze... Howling dogs... Goosebumps! [knocking continues] Holy shit! Mod! [Den] Hey! Mod, what happened? You look completely messed up. Did you run into a lynch mob or what? I can't remember shit. God damn it. It must be one of those gangs that drug and rob people. They must've drugged you and beaten you up. I'll find out who did this! Do you remember my name? My head's exploding. Mod... Go clean yourself up. You'll feel better. -[Mod grunts] -Be careful! Go slowly, bro! [cell phone ringing] CALLER MOD It's Mod's number. Hello, who's speaking? The police? What? Dead? That was the police? What happened? They said... Mod... Mod's dead. In an accident this morning. [reporter on TV] This chaotic scene is the aftermath of a shocking accident that happened earlier. The police have reported deaths and injuries. We'll keep you updated. This is it. [water running] I told you the headless shadow was an omen. Now, you believe me. "In three or, at most, seven days, the spirits of the dead will return." This one came back on the first day. I think he doesn't know he's already dead. [all whimpering] [all yell] [shop door beeps] [door creaks opens] Go check it out. Go on. Nothing here. Wait! What? -[floorboard creaks] -Shh! Shh! [inhales deeply] -What! -Are you nuts? What? Why are you so violent? To break down the door! Mod's inside, he'll get mad at us. Idiot You imbecile! Idiot! But you said it's okay when the sun's up. Well, just in case. -In case of what? -In case I'm wrong! Do you think I even believe what I said? Asshole! -You go inside! -No! You go first. [whimpering] [screaming] He's gone! -Yes, he's gone! -He's gone! -Gone with the wind! -Mod's gone! [all] Yeah! Look... Mod was our best buddy. We should make merit for him. So he'll have peace in his next life. Rest in peace, my friend. We make this offering for you. So you'll have something to eat over there. [monk chanting] [all exclaim] [whimpering] [monk chanting] Why didn't you tell me you'd be making merit? Don't worry. I already made the offering on your behalf. So you guys will have something to eat in the next life. [clicks tongue] What now? He refuses to leave. Did you see the horrible bruise on his neck? I think he's rotting. He's come back because he has unfinished business. We have to find out what it is. That way we can help him move on to the next life. [wind howling] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] Turn on the light. [clicking] Light's not working. [all screaming] What the hell's wrong with you? Don't be such a chicken. Just because there's no light. Say it. [Odd whispers indistinctly] [all whispering] Hey. Why are you so scared? I'm not going to eat you alive. Odd! I, uh... I brought these back to you. Keep 'em. Take them, please. I've watched them enough. Mod, this is the money I owe you. You're broke, keep it for yourself. No, I want to return it to you. Just take it, please. -Hey. -Huh? Den, do you have anything to return to me? I don't think so. Thank you, bro. [all chuckling] I love y'all. -[thunder rumbling] -[all scream] [all] He's gone! He's gone! -Hey. -[all shriek] Why are you celebrating? It's just the light coming back. [shop door beeps] [gasps] I got it! It's because of you, Den! What did I do? How could you forget it? Mod's ordination ceremony. I didn't do anything. I wasn't even there. Precisely! You weren't there. You were rushing to finish an assignment and you missed his ordination. You should've been there. That's Mod's unresolved issue. Now you have to become a monk for him. Isn't that a little hardcore? [temple bell rings] Do I have to chant something? Shit, I don't know! Sorry. I don't know, sir. No need then. -You think? -[Odd] Yeah. [breathes deeply] [together] He's gone! Ta-da! Mod's not here! Yippee, let's dance! Told you, he wouldn't have come back just for the 200 baht and some shitty porn. He came back to hitch a ride on your saffron robe. Sir... He wanted to go to heaven and he needed you to become a monk for that. But do you think Mod is tricking us again? No, I think he's gone for good. Sir, let's take a nap. We haven't slept in days. We'll go back to the temple in the evening. Right. Good. As you wish. Hurry up, are you going to disrobe today or not? Take it easy. I'm in a hurry too. How about the water party on Khaosarn Road? Shall we? Mmm-mmm! After you, sir. [chanting] Khaosarn Road! [all exclaim] [all whimpering] Bless... Bless... Bless you, Mod. What the hell's wrong with you? Especially you, Den! You didn't come to my ordination. Now you didn't tell me when you were becoming a monk! Do you still think of me as your friend? I became a monk for you-- Shut up! We're through! [thunder rumbling] [screaming] [whimpering] [chanting] -[lightning crashes] -[yelps] [continues chanting] [gasps] Kay! Why did you lock the door? You dimwit. Help me down. [exclaims] [Mod] Open the door! [thudding on door] I said open the door! Leave me alone, asshole! Leave me alone, please. Are you going to open it or not? [chanting] Buddha, help me. [screaming] [whimpering] Mod, please don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! Please. [screaming] Is he packing? I'll leave you guys alone! Mod! Where are you going? I remember it now. I was going downtown. I bought some flowers. I was going to see Ning. I knew it! Your unfinished business is... You didn't get to tell Ning you loved her. You knew it? So why did you tell me to become a frigging monk? Hey, Mod! Ning. Hi. I have something to tell you. But I don't know how to put it. [Kay] All's well that ends well. It's one heck of a ride. Yeah. I told you he'd clear up the unfinished business. [Den scoffs] When I disrobe, I'll smack your head real nice. Easy, sir. Easy, easy, sir. Let's go back to the temple. This way, sir. After you. Careful. Take it easy, bro. I've been waiting... Shit! [chuckling] [panting] Mod must be in peace now. On his way to heaven, I'm sure. I remember it now! Shit! I remember everything! [brakes screeching] [siren wailing] -Can you walk? -Yes, I can. [indistinct shouting] So... [all] You're not dead! No, I'm not. You thought I was already dead? Then the one who died was... [Ning] Mod. I have something to tell... [all exclaiming] [all whimpering] NEXT YEAR I'LL DRAG YOUR ASS TO THE WATER FESTIVAL. LATEST HIP: THIS SONGKRAN, I'LL BE AT CHANG PHUAK GATE. [dinging] [Hip] Jane, why're you smiling? [Jane] Just smiling! [Hip] Where will you celebrate the water festival? [Jane] Dunno. [Hip] Come up to Chiang Mai? [Jane] Nah. Never been. Don't wanna go solo. [Hip] C'mon! Dying to see you! [Jane] Okay! [Hip] Yeah! [Jane] I'll trick my friend to come along. [Hip] Bring ten! I'll take care of you. [Jane giggles] No. The nightclub strip is full of drunks. Khaosarn Road then. Nope. Silom? Silom is full of drunk white gays, they'll grab your ass. Then... Let's play outside my condo. No. Why not? I don't want to get splashed. Songkran is a water festival. Everyone gets splashed! I hate it. It's sticky, mucky, filthy. Count me out. It stinks. But I play it every year. Then you can go play by yourself. -Really? -Yeah. Okay. What? You said I can go by myself. Whatever you want. Thank you. Are you really going? Yes. [cell phone ringing] Hi, Jane. Songkran in Chiang Mai? Two pretty girls like us, would that be a good idea? Chiang Mai is the capital of handsome hunks. What? Groping? Scary. I'm in. I'm going to Chiang Mai with Jane. Bring me some northern sausages. What? Sure, I'll bring some. [camera clicks] DON'T FORGET THE NORTHERN SAUSAGES. STUPID BOYFRIEND! [Hip] Jane, where are you? [Jane] On the way to the airport. [Hip] Finally, I'll meet you! [Jane giggles] It'll be my first Songkran in Chiang Mai. [Hip] I'll be waiting at Chang Phuak Gate. I'll wear a yellow shirt. [Jane giggles] [Hip] Did you trick your friend to come along? Chiang Mai, here we are! It's going to be fun! There'll be so many people! I'm so excited! [Cat] Wait here. Cat, where're you going? Just a sec. [camera clicks] IN CHIANG MAI FINALLY! HIP: LIKE The famous red bus! Not so red with all the powder. A swarm of zombies up ahead. It's the Songkran crowd. Chiang Mai's water party is super-crazy. [crowd cheering] [Cat yelps] Kid, I'm not playing. I said no splashing! I'm not playing! [Jane chattering indistinctly] It's so far. It's a detour. Why? If we go straight, you'll get drenched and be upset. -[groans] I'm soaked anyway. -[giggles] [Cat] Aren't you tired? Not at all. Keep walking, Chiang Mai's so beautiful. Don't you like it? [Jane] Slow down! Hurry up! The hotel is just up ahead. -Hurry up! -So impatient! [both screaming] Kid, make some donations to ward off your bad luck. I'm fine. It's Songkran, you have to cleanse yourself from negative energies. This scented water will purify your karma... -I don't want it. -Just 100 baht. Thanks, auntie. You're in for a rough ride. A spirit is following you. -What? -A Buddha amulet for protection? Just 50 baht. I'm fine, really. The auntie senses something, we should make merit at a temple first. If I'm being shadowed by ghosts, why do we go to a temple? Haven't you seen horror movies? Of course I have. [laughing] In the movies, where do people run away from ghosts? To the temple. -And where do we cremate bodies? -The temple. So which place has the highest density of ghosts? -Whoo-hoo! The temple. -Yes! -[laughing] -Bitch, are you nuts? You're a grown woman, are you still afraid of ghosts? Ghosts aren't real. And you're not afraid? I'll be damned if I listen to you. I'll tell the ghosts to go after you. What a motormouth. Then get the Buddha amulet. -It's just 50 baht, I can afford it. -I'm sure you can. [both] Shit! This auntie is so creepy. -I feel bad about this. -Same here. -Let's dash. -Exactly my thought. -Go now. -Run like the wind! [both chattering indistinctly] [groaning laughter] [Cat] This is our street? [Jane] Right, so spooky. -[cell phone vibrating] -Who's calling? Must be your boyfriend. Pick up! -I won't. -Why not? Look, how many missed calls? Just one. Right. We've agreed on a rule. When I'm angry, he has to call 100 times before I pick up. No messages. He has to call. Oh, you're sick. I think I'm sick. But you're way sicker. Let's post a photo to get his attention. Sweet. ON THE WAY TO HOTEL WITH JANE. CREEPY STREET! HIP: LIKE Done. Let's go, I'm so sleepy. -Jane, where are you going after this? -Chang Phuak Gate. Why? Only tourists go to Tha Pae Gate. They go to Chang Phuak Gate to take pictures too. Lots of splashing there? Whooee! Nope. It's as dry as a desert. -Are you sure? -Yes. Picture as proof? This one, nice? Let me see. [screams] -It's a ghost! -What? A ghost! A ghost! What ghost! It was right there, help me! [whimpering] You're such a drama queen. We should hurry up. I can't move. Dead legs? [whimpering] You're so heavy! Speed up! -Wait. -What? Look, look. What? Here we are, Buddy Hotel. Seriously? Boss! Maybe our guests will cancel the reservation. Stop it! Don't say that. I was just kidding. Don't jinx it. They will come! Our hotel is the best in the zero-star class. All reviews talk about one thing, the ghost with a backpack. Well, I still have no idea what "the ghost with a backpack" is. You're my only staff -because you don't know what it is. -[rattling] Customer! Keep it. Good evening. Excuse me, is this a hotel? Yes. We have a reservation. Your name? Cat. Here it is. Good that you've arrived. We're fully booked. I almost gave your room to another guest. Anyway, the room is 2,000 baht. Wait! What do you have in the room? We have everything. -A closet? -Yes. A big one. -Remove it. -Huh? -There're always ghosts in the closet. -"Ghosts in the closet." All right, I'll see to it. -AC? -We have it. Cool as ice. -Remove it. -What? -Thai ghosts come out of AC too. -"AC too?" Please have the grills covered. I'll take care of that. The concierge will look into it. By the way, do you want the bed removed? How're we supposed to sleep? Ghosts come out from under the bed too. Thanks for reminding me. No beds. Just beds with no space underneath. If you don't have them, give us some futons. [mouths] What a pain! Jane, rest in peace. Fourth floor. Where're you going next? -Well... -No. I will go down to help at the reception. Excuse me, I'm talking to my friend. So are we going out later? It's late, I'm so tired. I'll stay in and rest. -I need a shower. -Me, too! Buddha, please help me. -Do you hear that? -What's wrong with him? I knew it. I knew it! Knew what? There must be a ghost in this elevator! Hey! You! Tell me. Is there a ghost in here? -Is there a ghost in here? -Buddha, protect me. Where is it? Tell me! Don't ask him! [Cat] Where is it? [Jane screams] I told you! Faster! [elevator bell dings] [chanting] [monk] She died so suddenly that she isn't aware of her own death. Your girlfriend can still see Jane because their minds have a bond. Jane's corporeal body has gone, but her spiritual presence remains. If she doesn't come back before the cremation, she'll turn into a wandering spirit. [woman sobbing] Boy... Keep calling Cat. She has to bring Jane back! [sobbing] [Cat] Nooks and crannies... I'm not sleeping here. C'mon. That freak will come up to arrange it. [sighs] -Cat. -Yeah? Do you think it's kinda hot in here? No. It's quite chilly in fact. Or... This room is haunted? Oh, not again! Stop being so paranoid. You'd better charge your phone and go take a shower. Then you should have a long good sleep. Because tomorrow, we're going to Chang Phuak Gate. What's wrong? -The mirror. -And? There's where you see ghosts! Not again! Idiot. Cut the crap, there's no ghost! [scoffs] [chuckling] [gasps] What now? -This is the proof. -Proof of what? Where there's a Buddha, there's a ghost. Listen, people think ghosts are afraid of Buddha statues. That means ghosts can see Buddha, and that can only mean one thing. Where there's a Buddha, there's a ghost. -Hey. -Shit! Where're you going? Weren't you over there? Right. So where're you going? I will return the Buddha and make them come up to arrange the room. They're so slow. Boss... What is it? Here she comes. So? Miss, please be patient. I'll send my staff to take care of the room. [muttering indistinctly] [screaming] This isn't right! Help! -Take the closet out. -Cat! Cat! Cat! What's the problem? Well... Just making sure you're okay. So what now? Right. Can you arrange the room as I've asked? If you can't, we'll move to another hotel. See? She said "we." -I heard it. -You heard? Take this back. I don't need it. All right. [whimpers] [screaming] Boss! What's wrong? [hotel owner screams] [Cat] What's going on? You take it. Buddha doesn't like me. [Cat exclaims] You take it! What's wrong with them? -You're acting so weird. -Yeah. [Jane] What's going on? This is ridiculous. You're getting on my friend's nerves. You hear that, her "friend" is upset now. Are you stoned? Please tell your friend to calm down. We'll do everything you ask. [staff breathing heavily] Thank you. Let's go. "Let's go..." What does she mean? What does she mean? Now you go and keep the Buddha safe. See, now you believe me. I never knew Buddha makes you see ghosts. Same here. Put this away. [screaming] Jane, come! Stop talking to them. [Jane] They're acting like they're seeing a ghost. Boss, are we really going up to their room? Not "we." You are. What? Me? They're taking forever to get their asses up here. [creature chitters distantly] [continues chittering] Boo! Oopsy-daisy! I'm so scared! So you're not scared? I'm scared of real ghosts. But a ghost like you, no way. Aw! Why not? I'm such a vicious ghost. Vicious? [laughs] You're not cut out for the vicious kind. If you really happened to be a ghost, you'd be a cutesy, Lolita kind of ghost. [chuckles mockingly] When I die, I'll come to spook you first. -Make sure I'm scared! -You bet. -Cutesy, sweetie ghost! -[laughing] -You're sure you're not scared? -[laughing] Are you sure? -You're not scared? -[gasps] [screaming] -What happened? -I saw a ghost in the mirror. -In the mirror? -Yes. I saw one too. -You too? -Yes! Did our eyes play tricks on us? It's just you and me here. If it wasn't a ghost I saw, then it was you. You're saying I look like a ghost? Maybe. [whimpering] Boss... I hate going up there by myself. The horror! Fourth floor, here I come. [elevator bell dings] [woman] Are you here for holiday? No. I work here. And you? You're here by yourself? [woman] No. I've been here since before you joined the hotel. Holy crap! I got a double jackpot tonight. I never got to leave the elevator. -Are the rooms here nice? -[screams] Whoa! You made me jump! We can talk, just don't come too close. I've never seen the rooms here. Can you show me? Huh? Show you the room? -Please. -[exclaims] Oh! Don't touch me! Please. Show me the room. Please, please. Please. Please. Please. [screaming] I really saw it back there. Let's go home, I won't be able to sleep. Cat, get yourself together. Look here. I have this amulet. My mother got it from a famous guru monk. -[clatters] -What? Why did you do that? Same logic as the Buddha. An amulet will bring ghosts. [yells] But if you don't have it for protection, the ghosts will come for you. Just leave it there. My mother will ask for it when I get home. Where is it? [clicks tongue] [both screaming] I saw it again! -Damn it! -[Jane babbling] I saw it too. -Jane! -What happened? -My legs got cramps, I can't move. -What? -Count to three and kick. -Okay. One, two, three! [strains] It's not working! I can't move! One, two, three! [Cat screams] They sprung back! Isn't it better? Not yet. Try this! [screaming] Better now? [grunting] -Good? -No! -You're okay now? -I'm fine, just go away! -Are you sure? -Don't touch me again, it hurts! -You. -Huh? Let's move out. I'm frightened. Not now. I'm tired. Don't worry, we'll be okay. But I can't stay here. I just can't! Let's move. Or let's go home, please. Cat, close your eyes. Breathe and try to sleep. -Soon you'll forget everything, trust me. -[sobbing] I'm right here, no need to be scared. [whimpers] ON THE WAY TO HOTEL WITH JANE. CREEPY STREET! CAT, CALL ME NOW. Boss, I saw it with my own eyes. "The ghost with a backpack." -So you saw it! -Uh-huh! -[elevator bell dings] -Now, please don't run away. Stay here with me. Eed. Here comes trouble. Why such a hurry? Come on! Let me drop the key first. Are you checking out? No, I'll be back. She's not leaving. [owner] Did you have a good night's sleep? Are you kidding me? -As good as a ghost! -Stop it. Well, it was wonderful. Not a single ghost in sight. Maybe that fat demon is gone. The key. Hey, hey. Let's test it. It's gone, isn't it? Great, now we can put the Buddha away. [screaming] You moron! Speak faster! I was going to tell you it's right there! [crowd cheering] [dance music playing] HIP: "I'LL WEAR A YELLOW SHIRT." Don't splash the water. Are you Chinese or Thai? Don't you understand Thai? [exclaims graciously] Yes, we're at Chang Phuak Gate. -Hey! -What's up? -This is Chang Phuak Gate. -Yeah. You said it's as dry as a desert here. Usually there's no splashing here. -You fooled me. -I didn't! You lied! Maybe it's an exception this year. [exclaims] Then why am I the only one who gets soaked? How the hell would I know! [in English] No water please! [in Thai] A man in a yellow shirt... I'll come back. Jane! Hey, Jane. Jane! [shrieks] Jane! No water, please! Oh! Where did he go? I'm here, Jane! Jane! [all screaming] [Jane] Cat! [shrieks] Holy shit! [cheering] Cat! Hey, Cat! Cat! Take it easy! Cat! I'm beat, let's go back. Stay a little longer. Aren't you tired? We've been here all day. I haven't got a drop of water on me. Is it my fault no one wants to get you wet? Okay, let's post a photo of us at Chang Phuak Gate first. -Come, we can upload it now. -Yeah. -Which way? -Your hand's stumpy. -No, no, no. No! -[squeals] -What? -Give me my phone! A message from a guy! [laughs] Give it back! -Let me see it first. -No! It's my job to filter out shitty men for you. No. What kind of guy calls himself "Hip Chang Phuak?" That's my type. "My dear Hip, I'll see you in Chiang Mai." "DID YOU TRICK YOUR FRIEND TO COME WITH YOU?" So this is the real reason you wanted to come to Chiang Mai? No! I wanted to spend time with you. We haven't taken a trip together in a long time. I'm leaving. Cat! Let me explain! Cat! Key, please. -The key. -Right. Are you leaving? Yes. Just realized I was such a fool. Can you believe it? The friend coming with me-- We believe you. So you knew? Everyone knows, except you. She told me she wanted to come and spend time with me. Who'd have known she was coming for a guy? There's another male ghost! -I'm checking out. -What? -But my friend's staying. -No! [both whimpering] -Excuse me. -[screams] Not another ghost! I've had enough! Miss, take a deep breath and listen to me first. I'm not a ghost. I'm Hip. I am not a ghost. Your friend Jane, isn't she coming with you? How do you know Jane's my friend? I've been chatting with Jane on Facebook for months. She talks about you all the time. Sometimes she sent me pictures of you two together. She also said she'd ask you to come to Chiang Mai for Songkran. So why isn't she here? She's here. With me. No, you're here by yourself. I was with her until an hour ago. In that case I must've seen her. But you've been alone all this time. That's the truth. Don't you get it? I get it, it's you who don't get it. I'll show you the photos. Where's your friend, huh? When you posted pictures, you always tagged them to Jane's Facebook. I'm her friend, so I saw your photos. I've been following your movements but you're always alone. -Jane's not in any of the photos. -[phone vibrates] [Cat] Must be Jane. Boy... Cat, calm down and listen to me. Jane's dead. She died on the way to the airport. A car rammed into her taxi... [brakes screeching] [screaming] ...and it crashed into the barrier. [screaming] [tires squealing] [Boy] Jane broke her neck and died on the spot. I'm at her funeral now. What're you talking about? This isn't funny. [inaudible] Isn't it kinda hot in here? Everyone knows, except you. [Boy] Jane still doesn't know she's dead. You have to bring her back, or she'll turn into a wandering spirit. [gasps] What if... What's with her? Jane, you crazy bitch! [sniffles] You crazy bitch! You died... And you played me for a sucker! What kind of friend are you? You know I'm scared of ghosts! You don't pity me at all! You fooled me! -[elevator bell dings] -[door closes] The stupid haunted elevator! -Cat! -Shit! Oh, are you still mad at me? -What's wrong? -[shrieks] You hate me that much, huh? Please don't play trick-or-treat with me anymore. You're mad that I didn't tell you about Hip? I didn't trick you to come to Chiang Mai. I really wanted you to come. I feel safe when you're with me. I'm not talking about that. Forgive me, please. -Please! -[screaming] No! C'mon... Your legs have gone stiff again? I've got cramps! Cramps? Stand straight up. Let me go! Just leave me! -Your legs got cramps. -Yeah. My mother once told me, the cure for cramps... Is to squeeze the upper lip. [muffled screaming] Or was it the lower lip? Huh? [wailing] Better? No. How come? I got it! Maybe both lips together. [groans] -Feeling better? -No, not at all! -Are you okay now? -I'm not okay! -Is it gone? -Not yet! [coughing] Are you crazy? [elevator bell dings] -[door opens] -[exclaims happily] We're getting out. [Boy] Cat, listen to me. Jane's dead. You have to bring her back, or she'll turn into a wandering spirit. Come on out. -What's this? -[sniffling] [sobbing] Why did you leave me alone? When did I leave you? I love you. Well... I love you too. [sniffles] What's wrong with you? So toothing. It's "touching." Let's go. Shall we? Look, they love each other. [both] Hmm. [dialogue inaudible] -Good luck. -Mmm-hmm. If you don't want to get splashed, we can go to the mountain together. No water fight there. I have to go back. So soon! Stay with me another day. I have to attend a friend's cremation. Oh... [clicks tongue] You. Don't be sad. She's gone to a better place, believe me. [sobbing] Come home with me. I don't want to go alone. I feel safe when you're with me. Aw. Stop crying. I'm going back with you. Such a crybaby. -Let's go. -[sniffles] [sniffles] Aren't you afraid of ghosts? [sobbing] I'm one of them now. I'm afraid of ghosts, but a ghost like you, no way. [sobbing] Cat! [sobbing] Thank you for coming back to spook me. [all] Thank you. -Yes, sir! -[Den] Shut up! [chuckles] [all sigh] [Ning] Mod. [all exclaim] Mod. I've been waiting for you. [all exclaiming] [Tar] Your love is a shadow. I can run but I cannot hide. [chuckles] We'll be together forever. [Hip] Who's this? This is Hip Chang Phuak speaking. I've got plenty of girls on my list! This is nothing! Hip Chang Phuak? [chuckling] Right. All right, I'll tell you more later. See you at the bar. [softly] Hippo's more like it! Prick! See you. Asshole! What was that?
