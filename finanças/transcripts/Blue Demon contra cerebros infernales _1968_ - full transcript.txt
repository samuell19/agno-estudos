Blue Demon vs. The Infernal Brains I've just been sent from the Orient by the great heirarchs. They've become impatient. They want to know when the experiments will be completed and what they can expect from them Just a few days ago Drs. Sanders and Randall finished them with the greatest success and will soon carry out the first operation on an atomic scientist, Dr. Robles What sort of operation is that and what will be the result? It will be a brain extraction, and through the portentious discoveries of Dr. Sanders it will give up all it's secrets The same will happen to all the scientists whose knowledge you'd like to buy Excuse me... but all this would have to be observed by one of our own scientists, Dr. Cadar, to whom I will give orders to come here from New York immediately I want you to let the doctors know about his arrival so they can prepare an introduction There's no problem, I understand that before buying you want to confirm the truth of the discoveries One last question The disappearance of a well known figure like Dr. Robles, wouldn't that have grave consequences? No, because there will be no disappearance They will transplant another brain to Dr. Robles' body, he'll live with that for a few hours and later when they find him dead no one will be able to guess the cause or attribute it to them Magnificent. You already know how well the Organization takes care of it's scientists so I hope Dr. Cadar will be in no danger He will be at no risk, no one knows a thing about these experiments There's only one person, a masked wrestler who's been snooping around over the disappearance of some wrestlers who served as guinea pigs for the experiments He'll be eliminated in his next match by his opponent, The Caveman who's been bribed to take him out for a good long time Well, you should be very careful, as I'm holding Drs. Sanders and Randall personally responsible for Dr. Cadar's safety and you know the punishment for those that fail Let them know. Dr. Cadar. Let's go. How was your trip Dr. Cadar? Long, very long. And Dr. Sanders? He's making the final preparations. I don't suppose there'll be a delay? Absolutely, everything is going as planned We've followed closely the last instructions sent by Code Z6 You've taken all the necessary security measures? I graduated from the same political school that you did Dr. Cadar and Kathia, our magnificent collaborator, is in charge of security I'm satisfied with that When a woman is that beautful she tends to take care of her duties better than any man Matahari is still well remembered You're quite gallant Dr. Cadar. Hopefully I can reaffirm the validity of your theory Something happened, we lost contact There's nothing to be done, I'll take you home Let me go! Careful boss! You can't harm me with your little gun Welcome Doctor Dr. Sanders This is our workstation, Kathia is in charge of it Very interesting Kathia knows the function of every one of our machines from oscilloscopes to this extraordinary apparatus What does it do? It's a codifier of the intelligence of the human voice It splits the vocal or mental wavebands into five frequency segments and translates or inverts them to be recombined later Ah, I understand, on being recombined the transmitted signals are made understandable, a type of lateral wavelength We've recently perfected this system thanks to the genius Dr. Sanders Stupendous, I congratulate you colleagues and most of all you Kathia Thank you Dr. Cadar I will present you to my control personnel They're also in your charge? Yes Doctor And these are your guard corps? Masterworks of Dr. Sanders Their reflexes are conditioned soley to our ends A type of zombie Please Dr. Cadar, we're men of science It's best we call them... robots. This way Doctor, you're about to see the final results Raise the voltage Martha Raise it to the maximum value It's at full capacity It's incomprehensible It looks like the brains we're removed There's no grey matter, no convolutions, no matter in the cranium at all We need to solve this enigma. I'll have an autopsy carried out on those two bodies immediately This is incredible. Your hypothesis turns every known concept of Z potential and electrolytic volts on its head It isn't a hypothesis Doctor, it's a fact It isn't possible, our scientists have spent years working with the current theories on Z potential, how are you able to isolate Beta, Phama and Gamma waves? Easily, with a new principle of ethereal physics, Nexalism. - Nexalism? Yes yes, nexalism Totalism applied on the electrolytic cephalus Well, even if that's so, how does that resolve the issue of scarification that's practically a matter of cellular regeneration? Through the electronic saturation of tildic chloride And how can you achieve the necessary temperatures to accomplish this? We get it done Doctor, we get it done It seems today will be a day of great and... pleasurable, surprises I sincerely hope so Dr. Cadar. It wasn't long ago that the laws of physics were absolute dogmas for me but every minute science brings us new discoveries and what was a certainty yesterday is merely a memory today Copernicuses, Kepplers, Eismans, there are dozens of them these days Incredible I'll have to change our entire scientific organization Millions and millions spent on nothing You didn't want to give us visas to enter your country Well, if you want... No, we're quite comfortable here Doctor No one bothers us or worries about what we're doing You know you have all the support of our government And the checkbook Oh yes, of course, the checkbook Here are the reciepts of all the deposits we made into Swiss accounts No, no need. Don't forget we're gentlemen Kathia, get the Doctor a cognac Serving Dr. Cadar will always be a pleasure for me Thank you Kathia Nothing, there's nothing Empty craniums... I never thought such a thing could exist What will you do? Consult Dr. Jimenez, he's the greatest authority in neurology And the subjects? This will be the final pre-operation phase We will lower the patients temperature to absolute cold Absolute cold? The temperature is different for every person but we know them through the amount of endurance every subject has But that will break the equilibrium of matter No Doctor, the electromagnetic procedure he'll undergo will compensate for it As you can see, we don't interrupt the key organic functions There's no danger of losing valuable genetic information You have it all, chromosomes, genes, and cardiokineses is normal Stupendous, stupendous This other subject is an Bulgarian you sent us He put our operation at risk and was punished We were authorized Doctor The order came through code Z6 I suppose our illustrious colleague will be satisified Within a few hours we'll start the operation Electromagnetic currents Z potential third phase The brain waves are being collected Let's begin the transplant There's no other wrestler like Blue Demon, when can you teach me to fight like that boss? Whenever you want, just not right now Wait for me in the car, I have to talk to Demon Alright boss We've destroyed his alcoholic coefficient When he wakes up in an hour he'll start drinking liquor desperately He'll die of alcohol poisioning within 48 hours Ingenious, that way we'll avoid suspicion Dr. Robles Let me congratulate you again, the plan and execution were perfect Yes, and very soon the Doctor's brain will be ready to reveal all its knowledge Very well, let's toast to success and most of all a toast for Kathia, that lovely woman whom I don't know if I should admire more for her beauty or efficiency We owe this small celebration to her efficiency seeing as how she was the one that's prepared everything I would have preferred seeing her do this dance, but no matter, I'll wait to have a dance with her when she shows up She won't come, she has more important matters to deal with and until we're done with our work there won't be time for such things, this little party included, which is now over And now it's time to rest for tomorrow Very well, but I'm telling you now, that woman will come with me Everything in it's own time Doctor, I think you have the means to convince her but you'll have to wait for the right time - And now goodnight - Goodnight What happened to Dr. Robles is very strange Our colleague is a quite normal man, he isn't addicted to alcoholic beverages but this morning he was detained by the police for causing a disturbance in a nightclub Of course as soon as they realized who he was he was set free and taken home by the police But the strange thing is that this morning Dr. Calvin, his assistant, went looking for him and discovered he was missing There's something more grave, when they took him to his house he had forgotten our language, he spoke in a strange tongue, surely a slavic one Sir, due to the ultra-secret nature of our work, well, I haven't dared to give word to the police What do you plan to do? We're already taken the necessary steps and in its own time we'll let you know about them Mr. Don Juan, would you let me accompany you? Martha, I didn't tell you to come here I took the liberty to be with you Does it bother you that I came? Don't forget I'm working and I came here looking for information Sure, I know what kind of information Don't worry, I won't interfere unless it's necessary Some inheritance I got from agent I took over for An inheritance you enjoy, right boss? Wait here Do you know Dr. Robles? Robles, Robles The name doesn't ring a bell They told me you were drinking with him last night Oh, the old man from last night, my countryman Countryman? Yes, he was speaking Bulgarian and since the owner couldn't understand him he called me over to see what he wanted Is this him? That's the one, and that old man could drink We drank three bottles of rum He was completely smashed when he left and I was pretty wasted myself Do you know where he went? No, did something happen to him? I need to talk to him A strange type, he started talking about our country, if I knew this place or that, and what I did, and times he would change and say things that made no sense I think something's wrong with the old man Bear, as a Bulgarian could you tell if he was a native or he was just trying to pass himself off as being from your country No sir, the guy was more Bulgarian than me, too bad he was short a few marbles Thanks Bear, you have to keep helping me Whatever you ask, you know I'm always at your service If you see the old man again don't leave his side for an instant, contact me through the usual means Don't forget, it's very important and I repeat don't leave him alone Don't worry, the Bear always keeps his promises - What did he die of? - Alcohol poisoning We found him near death in a cheap hotel room filled with empty liquor bottles Are you sure it was alcohol poisoning? I've been practicing my profession for a few years now Sir I don't doubt your diagnosis but I'd like to be absolutely sure When will the autopsy take place? I'd be able to give you the certificate tonight I'll come by for the report You're a butterfingers Get that please Hello? Who's asking? Just a moment please The forensic doctor Yes? What's going on? Something incomprehensible, it wasn't possible to do the autopsy What? In less than two hours Dr. Robles' body disintegrated completely He became an unformed mass Demon! Where'd he go? The beggar has insufficient coronary mitochondria Magnificent, that way Dr. Jimenez will die of a heart attack We need to finish our work immediately In my opinion it's very urgent, the masked man and his friends put our operation at grave risk Those meddlers are running out of time I understand Mind if I sit down? Not at all, go ahead I know I'm probably being rude, but- Not at all, everything's fine I've noticed that your companion has been gone for a while and I said to myself "That gentlemen is in trouble, I should rescue him" Good idea, I always have problems with that girl Your girlfriend? Just a friend Did she leave? Yes, I bet she did If I were in her place I'd never cause any problems No? You're quite sure of that I am, because I like you I know you're the kind of man that I can get close to, and that's only a first impression I like you too, and very much, though I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before How strange, I've come here very few times Me too, but we must have coincided at some point Let's hope we keep coinciding You can be sure that I wouldn't want it any other way Dr. Jimenez I enjoyed this very much Now if you'll give me a moment to freshen up Naturally I hope you won't leave in my absence No, no Tell me if I'm range This is Serenaika, am I in range? Am I in range? Attention Poker Ace, attention This is Poker Ace Oscillator at full power, perfect QSL QSL, I'm at the site and have completed my objective, the agent is in my hands Very good Serenaika I'll entertain him until you send for him but be careful, he's an able and intelligent man, over Very good, I need him alive, I'll send for him Perfect, I'll hold him, Serenaika out Damn! They've been listening to us This machine belongs to the masked man and his allies One of them must be nearby They'll have to come from their transmitter and it will cost them dearly Boss, I've just learned that- If you've just learned it then I know it too. Where's that Serenaika? I asked you where she is She just came out of the ladies room with two women Let's go, we have nothing more to do here What are you doing here? I don't know how you could've been so careless It was just a matter of abandoning the body of Dr. Jimenez there and no more, why attack and mortally wound a stranger? Yes, that could help the police and our enemies locate us We couldn't have foreseen the situation How will we handle these things in the future? I'd like to say that the responsibility is all mine as the organizing and defense of our organization is my duty Sadly I was busy with other duties that night, as you know but that is neither an excuse nor a reason You're a brave woman to recognize your mistake I know that a system based on improvisation and omissions leads to failure and I also know that when an error is commited it should be corrected immediately And how will you do that Kathia? I've found out what hospital this man is at, he's gravely injured and is awaiting an operation Before the operation he won't be any danger to us, he won't be able to talk And..? I'll take care of the rest I congratulate you Kathia, that's the spirit is the that should be everywhere in an organization like ours But forgive me, I have a small misgiving Don't our dead robots present a hazard as well? Not at all Dr. Cadar, the dead don't speak Like in the first case, the bodies of these men found at the amusement park show nothing There's no brain No circumvolutions or vestiges of a cerebral cortex Just a mass of liquid that at one point must have been a brain But thats diabolic Boss man, I'm scared Scared? Really? Well, can't I say one thing and mean another once in a while? Has he had any reactions? We need this man to answer some questions He's in a critical state, he won't be able to answer any questions Within half an hour we'll start preparing him Many lives in danger depend on what he could tell us You can count on all of our collaboration but up to a point This too is a life, and a human being You're right doctor, sometimes impatience leads us to ask for too much, but can you do something for me? Of course, I'm at your service I'd like to see the remains of Dr. Jimenez Very well, follow me if you please Impossible Less than an hour ago this was a dead man's body, but in a normal state We're in the midst of a mystery whose solution is nowhere in sight Doctor, have the remains transferred to the Atomic Institute at the University to be given to Dr. Calvin It's important to know what reduced him to this state A wise and prudent decision You and I will go see our friend Demon Mission accomplished That man will never talk He'll arrive dead to the operating table You're marvelous Kathia Dr. Cadar, it was an improvisation to correct an error commited, it won't happen again Explain yourself Easily, before I arrived at the hospital with that man the special agent was there They don't do a thing. So then what? Just as that agent overestimates us we overestimate him He's a very able man Very well Kathia, how serious is this business? In your opinion, what should we do? We're listening I saw that the special agent and his partner were led by the medic to the autopsy room And? There they found the remains of Dr. Jimenez But it wouldn't be his body anymore, just disintegrated and mummified remains That's the danger, to be exact, the danger and the stroke of luck Why dangerous and lucky? I think I can explain. Dangerous because the special agent will have those remains examined, it's logical Where? At the Atomic Institute at the Univesity. But why's that dangerous? Because the man in charge there is none other than Dr. Calvin Dr. Calvin, eminent researcher. Yes, he could discover the cause behind the disintegration Bad, very bad. And now what's the lucky part? I can guess, but I'll let Kathia explain For the same reason, we know Dr. Calvin will analyze them, and since that isn't in our interests, we'll pay him a little visit and convince him permanently It's a marvel to work like that, with enthusiasm and intelligence, but this lovely woman has to do so much hard work This woman knows that behind all this is a check with a number with many zeros behind it Oh yes, the check. Very well, I'm proud and want to reward you Thank you, I'll bring Dr. Calvin here. She's very valuable to our organization. It would be very expensive for anyone who tried to hire her Oh, a ping pong strategy? Very well, I don't care. Money, checks, whatever you want, I like that woman and she must be mine, understood? Those women have just fired at Demon! You don't want to believe me. Quiet! Let me see it all well, let me observe it all well Go now, I feel better Luckily the effects aren't of the permanent sort Do you feel alright Demon? I thought the match was going normally until... Until they shot me with one of their paralyzing rays we ran into before. But who? Two woman who looked alot like that Serenaika you met the other night, but it wasn't her. Yes? Yes, this is the place. For the first time I'm getting desperate during an investigation. Yes, he's here, just a moment. Urgent call for you boss Hello, Lieutenant Reyes here. That's quite a surprise. Hear me well: order a strict watch over the Atomic Institute at the university A moment Lieutenant. Hold on, don't hang up. Ask for protection for the science faculty I want you to set up a group of agents to be in charge of taking care of the lives of every member of the institute, is that understood? Yes, yes, I'll be there later. What happened boss? I'll answer Ms. Martha. Dr. Calvin has disappeared as well, he was kidnapped How did you know Demon? A logical deduction. We're facing an organization that kidnaps men of science Calvin was in charge of analyzing the remains of Dr. Jimenez Calvin was the next candidate to disappear. Of course Demon, how could I not have seen this coming? I'm the one responsible for what's happened I'm going crazy here, never in my career have a come across a case like this Don't worry boss, you'll solve it Yes yes, I'll solve it Indubitably, because justice always triumphs and it's our duty to achieve it I only want to know one thing: how? Of course there'll be danger, a lot of it. We'll need to risk it all That won't stop me, many times we put it on the line for insignificant things and this time we're dealing with a fundamental issue, one which I'd love to get to the bottom of I'm willing to do anything, anything Demon. The problem has a very simple answer. We said we're dealing with an organization of assassins dedicated to kidnapping men of science Yes, that's so. The solution is this: The eminent sage Vicente Morales arrived in the city today. His lectures on problems and perspectives of the atom will be invaluable for anyone interested in this new scientific discipline. That marvellous Kathia works better than the best Swiss clock Dr. Vicente Morales, atomic sage. We're in luck, and this marvellous lady's always looking for something to do You'll soon see Doctor, that I always aim to please The important thing is this, that if manage to get a hold of Dr. Morales, then we'll have completed our investigative cycle. That's true. Our work and toil would be over, and we'd be out of danger Then? I'll bring Dr. Morales here within 24 hours. Marvellous, marvellous. Alright colleagues, the preparation of Dr. Calvin has been one of the easiest His brain will be ready to be extracted after 5 pm with absolutely no trouble Stupendous. What's going on? What the hell are you doing here? The same thing you are. I ordered you not to leave the laboratory, you'll get instructions there But you forgot that there's quite a few kilometers between here and the lab Anyway, no one suspects I would be with you. What will I do with you? Tear you limb from limb or just throw you out the window? Don't be angry with me boss, I have the micro-radio to keep up and help you. Well, theres nothing to do but to deal with it now. Luck is always on my side, it seems. We should be in constant contact through the micro-radio Don't worry boss, I'll follow orders. Attention Blue Demon, attention. This is XE1FFT, do you copy? The special agent was captured, leave your line open, I'm going to locate him now Do you copy? Over Very good Kathia, incredible efficiency You'll get a special award for your magnificent work and something more Thank you very much Dr. Cadar. Vircos, prepare the electroscopes, we're going to examine the patient Attention Blue Demon, attention, the signal is coming from the west, I repeat, the west. Do you copy? Over. Close the connectors properly, there's a lot of static The connection is properly closed Vircos, check the generators, there's interference Attention Blue Demon, attention, I'm heading northwest, repeat, northwest, over USL, I'm going northwest, USL, I'm going northwest Look Doctor, a micro-radio! I've lost contact! Attention Blue Demon, he's been discovered, I repeat, he's been discovered The Counter-Espionage is on to us, this microwave transmitter is only carried by its agents We need him alive! He's more valuable alive. I should have guessed. Reanimate him! Dr. Morales, or would you rather I called you Mr. Counter-Espionage agent? What is your number? Hello Serenaika. I'd be very interested in learning how you managed to discover us The only thing I managed to learn I picked up in Elementary school, but I forgot it in High school Now that you've discovered our secret you're going to talk fool! I lament not showing you more than those brains, but it was all I needed. Look at them. It surprises you, doesn't it? It took me 20 years of work, 20 years of fleeing from one country to the other. Travel is enlightening Professor, I congratulate you. Shut up and listen. Know this: I did it! I did it! Those brains are alive, and with all of their creative power They speak and tell me their secrets, don't you hear? Their secrets! As you had so much interest in learning my secret I'll let you know, because in a short while your brain will be there and it will reveal the password of the Counter-Espionage agency. Of course my brain is at your disposal Professor. Connect it! The perforations are turned into electrical impulses that are radiated to the exterior. Quite a novelty, eh? Dr. Robles, tell us all you can about your theory on mass equilibrium. The potential mass of the of the cerebral cortexes. is regulated by Rath frequencies. I'm closing in on the location of the last transmission, I know where he is. I'm almost to the place. This same theory also applies to the expansion of the universe. Fantastic. Einstein's theory was correct. We need confirmation of the Damov theory. Is it true that the elements that make up the universe were created at the same time as the expansion Doctor? I'm speaking to Dr. Robles about that problem. and we believe we have the solution. I have it Dr. Jimenez. From Copernicus to Einstein, there's been a direct path to the truth Here we have Dr. Robles and his assistant Dr. Calvin When can you work on the matter? Immediately. We'll have to work on some equations. Very well Dr. Robles. Coefficient 6. Endocrine saturation. The brains are fatigued, they have to rest We have very valuable information there, we can radiate them in an hour Your country will be satisfied Dr. Cadar And now it's your turn Agent X Soon you'll be frozen and your brain will reveal Counter-Espionage's code word Sounds good, I'm dying of heat here You won't catch me alive! Never! I'll destroy my labor, the most portentious discovery in the world! But everyone, everyone will die with me! No Dr. Sanders, don't do it, I don't want to die! Everyone! That villain, they've killed all the doctors and all that science was lost No, their lives may have been lost but their work will live on All their investigations have been recovered and recorded Science and progress are immortal Who is Blue Demon boss? One day you'll know that Blue Demon is the incarnation of good and justice. The End
