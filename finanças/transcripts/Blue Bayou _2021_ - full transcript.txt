You know, I can fix just about anything. You know, I can fix motorcycles, you know, cars. - Hell, I can fix a lawn... - What'd you steal? Motorcycles. You know, but that was... A long time ago. You know, I could... If you give me a chance, you know, I could be a real asset to your workplace. I don't think so. Sir, you got kids? I've got a couple. Um... I got this baby on the way, and I'm just looking for another job. Where you work at now? Tattoo parlor. I think you're better off there. Can't help you. Okay. Thank you. Come on, let's go. Keep up! Come on! Baby, you're gonna need to sign up first. You need to come back! She looks healthy. "She"? Yeah, it's a girl. - Okay, we can wipe off the gel. - Wait. Can we hold a minute?

It's a good choice. Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late. What's wrong? I just want to spend one last day with you before things change. - What you mean? - You know. Once the baby gets here, you're gonna pay less attention to me. That's not true. Who told you that? It's okay. She'll be your kid. - Hey. - You're supposed to love her more. - Hey, hey, stop right there. - You'll leave me like ace did. I'm-a love you all the same. Okay? I ain't going nowhere. You hear me? We'll see. Stay right here. All right, we're not going to school today. Get on. I'm too short. Well, you're gonna need to grow, because I can't be picking you up all the time. I'm gonna grow. I'm gonna grow taller than you. Then I'm gonna get a motorcycle that you can't get on. Oh, yeah? Well, we'll see about that. Who be paying $600 on some goddamn shoes? I mean, what kind of fucking diamonds they got in 'em? Don't make no sense, man. She's the one that should be paying me, not the other way around. - He's talking so much. - Hear me out, bro. I been eating all this nasty-ass healthy food for about a month now, and then on top of that, on top of that, I been working out - every other day. - You want to try? I ain't missed a day yet. I mean, shit, look at me. I mean, I know I look chiseled like a Greek god, bro. You can't tell me - no different. - You skipped a couple days, merk. Ain't that some bullshit. Whoa, man! Come on, man. What the fuck you doing? Hey, man, chill. I wasn't gonna let her. - Somebody find a goddamn babysitter. - Hey. - Just let the girl tattoo you. - What? - All right, you done. Get the hell out of here. - Shit. - Get your whining ass out the chair. - Well, you come sit right here and let her tattoo you, - goddamn it. - You want to do one on me? - Let me see this shit. - Look at it, bro. - Really? - Yeah. - Shit look dope, huh? That look like a dog took a shit on your back. - That's what it looks like. - Fuck you, bro. All day, - you've been giving me shit. - Why is you putting that on? What you mean? You want to see me naked? You got to clean it and wrap it. If you knew what I was dealing with on a regular day... - Put it on my hand right here. - That's why I don't want - to shake your hand, merk. - I don't want to shake - your raggedy hand, either. - You know I can get shut down - for this shit. - Hey, chill out, man. They're having a parent-child bonding moment. Don't mess that up. How would you know what that is? Your mama done dropped you on your head. Ooh, watch it, sweetheart. I'll come back by tomorrow and shut this whole place down. You better have papers for Rodrigo's ass over here, - 'cause I'll deport him, too. - Bitch, I was born here, old ugly-ass motherfucker. Shut the fuck up, you meth head-looking motherfucker. - Ooh. - Please, stupid motherfucker. - Good job. - Antonio, you wanted to talk? Yes, ma'am. Hey, stay right here, okay? - What you need? - You know, I'm having a baby soon, and, uh, you know, I was just wondering if maybe, you know, you could float me some clients. I'm... I'm just a little tight on cash. How can you ask me for favors when you haven't paid your station fees? Yeah. Okay. I'm working on it. - Is that it? - Yes, ma'am. What's that thing do? Oh, this? This so the bad guys can't hurt me. You see, we got a lot of bad people in this country. So, my job is to find them and kick 'em out. Why would you tell her that? She asked me a question. The only bad guy in here is you, merk. Rent-a-cop-looking-ass motherfucker. - Yeah, merk! - Yeah, merk. - You have bad tattoos. - You're supposed to be on my side. Stay out, deporting motherfucker. Shit, I'm going to work right now. I'm done with y'all. - How's your mom been, Jess? - She's good. How come you don't visit anymore? You got to ask your mama that. What is this place? Where we going? Uh, it's my secret spot. - Really? - Yeah. Not even your mama know. Really? See? - Look at this. - Hey. - Can I go in? - You want to swim with the gators? - Yeah. - I mean, if you think you brave. Which rock? - Seriously. - You trying to skip a rock? There's no skipping right there. That just went straight to the bottom. Yeah. Hey, Jessie. Can I ask you a question? What you said this morning, was that a blue thought or a true thought? What you mean? Well, was you saying that because you was sad, or you really think that's true? 'Cause, you know, the real truth is, I chose you and your mama. Jessie, why you call me dad? - Hmm? - Because you're my dad. Because you chose me. Just like I choose you. Then why did you cry at the hospital when you saw the sonogram? You never cry for me. I cry for you all the time. When? Like when I see the way you dance. When I see the way you run. Not funny. When I see how your face look like in the morning. When I smell your stinky breath. - When... - I brush my teeth! - Least my head's not small. - You say - my head's small? - No. Don't. - Oh, you gonna have to pay for that. - No, I didn't. No. - You're gonna have to pay for that. - No, don't! Don't! You gonna have to pay for that. - You gonna have to pay for that. - No, I didn't say that. One. Two. - I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do that. - Obviously. Where'd the cow go on a vacation? Where'd the cow go on vacation? - Moo York. - Moo York? Okay, that was a pretty good one. Ha! Wait, what? Hey, be careful. Don't... Don't... I got you! You know what this is? That's Spanish moss. Oh. Hey! - Stop tricking me. - I'm not tricking you. Take this. This is yours. Hey, don't tell your mama. - Okay? - Okay. What? - I believe you now. - Believe what? That you're gonna love us the same. There's a fly on your face. Come on, let's go. How about this one - right here? - Beautiful. Here, put it on my ear. - Okay. - You gonna put it on my ear? - And I'll give you one. - How I look? - It looks good. - Okay. Hey, now we all have flowers. Gonna eat it? - Come on. - Eat what? Hey, I was thinking of going back to work. Just part-time. - Hey. - All right, Kathy, you need to let me see my daughter. I told you, she's been sick. She can't be sick every weekend. Well, she said she wants to stay home this weekend. Kathy, you listen to me right now. You are gonna let me see her on Saturday. - No, ace. I mean it. - You're trying to keep me from seeing my daughter, that's what you're doing. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - Yes, you are. - Hey, you turned your back on us. You left us. You gonna hold that on me forever? You don't get a say in this anymore. Finished? - Yeah. - Don't. Don't you dare try and put this on him. He's always been there for me and Jessie. No, you can't just call whenever you want. Hey. Everything all right with Jessie today? You're doing good. She told me you were looking for another job. Mm. Hey. Don't worry. It'll come. Okay? You stay right, and... Things will work out. Okay? I promise. Hey. You think, uh, Jessie should spend more time with ace? Where's this coming from? You know, I just think that maybe... She need to spend more time with her daddy. You're her daddy. I know. I mean, I've tried. I can't make her. She doesn't want to. You ever think about how ace feel? Not even on my best day. They barely knew each other. Kathy. What's all this? Huh? Just stuff she wants. Put it back. We don't need any of this. I can do that. No problem. Bye. Who is that? Rhonda's just asking if I can cover her for a day. Why is she asking you? "Win a trip to Hawaii"? Can I have some tapioca pudding? "Can I have "some tapioca pudding," what? Can I have some tapioca pudding, please? No. Now put it back, okay? Here. Jessie, now hurry up. We've got to pick stuff up from grandma's. Hey. Hey, you get the picture I sent you last night? - Picture? Picture of what? - Yeah. Of the sausage. So, it's a kind of andouille. Yeah, some new cajun shit. I picked it up at winn-Dixie. Look at that. Why are you showing me a picture of that? Huh? You got to order this shit online, it's so fucking good. - You get your sausage online? - Huh? Yeah, well, when it's premium sausage like this, I do. Yes. That's for sure. Hey. Hey, why don't we go on a trip? Why don't we decide what we're gonna buy for dinner? No, I'm serious. We never been on a family vacation, okay? I'd love that. But... we can't afford it. - Chips, chips, chips... - Yes, we can. - With what money? I'll sell my bike. Okay. Okay, excuse me, folks. We're on duty. We're gonna need some service. Uh, hey, you guys have any of the premium sausages? Hey, where you want to go? - Just stop. Just stop. - Hawaii! Just... you don't think I want to be the fun parent, too, huh? Let's go to Hawaii. Hey, what you need to go to Hawaii? - I might need some sunscreen and bathing suits. - Stop it. Bathing suit. What else? Some cheetos. Cheetos? Hey! I'm done, okay? Let me show you a picture. Something like that. I asked you a question. Did-did you take Jessie to school yesterday? 'Cause I got a call saying she never showed up. We needed to spend some time together, okay? We needed to spend some time together. You need to be her parent, not her friend. I mean, of course I want you to spend time - with her, but... - Kathy? She don't look that sick to me. Hey, baby. Hey, darling. Hey, where you going? - Where you going, baby? - What's going on here? - Huh? - It's okay. What's going on here? Hey, isn't that your kid? Y... nah, it's okay, Denny. Oh. You the guy who won't let him see his child. - Den, just go wait in the car. - No, no, no. - Let's figure this out. - Just go wait in the car, Denny. We all here. Let's figure this out. Why don't you go wait in the car while we talk, okay? What'd you say to me? Listen, I'm an officer of the law. - You don't tell me what to do. - Why don't you go wait - in the car. We talking, okay? - Okay, you will address me - as "sir." We can talk. - We talking. Okay? We talking. - But you will address me as "sir." - Okay? - Okay, okay, let's, let's go. - "Sir." Let's try it. - "Sir." - come on. Let's go. - And did I say you could leave? - Bye, baby. Bye, sweetie. - Don't you walk away from me. - Bye, honey. Hey, look, you don't walk away from an officer of the law. - Denny. Denny, let's go. - Stop. Stop! I'm-a tell you one last time! - Okay, that's it. - Jesus fucking Christ, Denny. Put your arms behind your back. Stop! - Let him go! - Don't hurt him! - Do not resist! - Ace! Ace, get him off of him! - No...! Jesus fucking Christ, Denny. - No! Don't hurt him! - Fuck you! - No! Stop! - It's okay. - Daddy! - Give me your hands. Give me your hand. - No, daddy! - Get on your knees! - Ace, what the fuck?! Do something! No! Stop! Don't hurt him! No! Stop! It's okay. It's okay. Go back to your mama. Okay? I posted bail. He should have been out by now. I'm sorry. It looks like something came up. It's just gonna take a little longer to process. - Just have a wait. - What do you mean? H-How long is this gonna take? You're just gonna have to wait. I'm sorry. Miss? Miss. Can you please help me? I have a little girl here. Okay. Just give me a second. I'll try to find out. Thank you. Kathy, I'm gonna take Jessie to my house. She should wait here, with me. This is no place for children. No, mom, we're gonna wait here for Antonio. Okay. So, it looks like he's not here anymore. Ice took him. - What? - Yeah. Immigration and customs enforcement has him now. I really wish y'all would have come to me sooner. Once a judge makes the decision, it's hard to get it overturned. I just don't understand how they can deport him. He was adopted. When'd you come to this country? 1988. Well, there was a bill that was passed in 2000 that grants, uh, citizenship to adoptees, but it only protects kids who were adopted after 2000. Looks like maybe your parents... They're not my parents. Well, whoever had custody of you, looks like they didn't follow the proper procedure to change your status. How's that his fault? I'm not saying it's his fault. It's a loophole dhs is using to deport people. You also have a criminal record. They dropped the charges. No charges were filed. No, from before. He has a past record. Ice is targeting people like you, adopted or not. - Where were you born? - Korea. We're married. Doesn't that Grant him citizenship? Even if you're married, the proper steps would've needed to be taken for him to get a green card or naturalized. I don't... I don't... I don't understand. Can't we do something about this? H-He has two kids. I mean, listen to him. Look at him. - He's American. - It doesn't matter what he look like. It's immigration policy. I was brought here when I was three. I've been here for over 30 years. Well, sometimes with these international adoptions in the '80s, the... - The proper paperwork wasn't filed. - Yeah, but, like... Like I said, I've been here for over 30 years. Okay? Can't you just tell them that-that... That I was... I was adopted by white people. I understand your frustration. I really do, but... That's not how it works. Now, here are your options. You can... Depart voluntarily... No, fuck that. And have a chance of receiving status. Or you can stay and appeal. But if you do that and the judge don't rule in your favor, you forfeit any opportunity to return to this country. What does that mean? It means, if he fights and loses, he can never come back. I'm not leaving my family. At this stage, we don't have a lot of options. But let me see what I can do to get you back in front of a judge. So, I need to talk to you about my retainer fee. Now, I usually charge $5,000 to start. And then, depending on how the case goes, we can talk about that at a later time. You have a right to be here. You won't have to leave 'cause they made a mistake. It's not your fault. Okay? We're gonna figure this out. I'm gonna borrow some money from my mom. - Hey, don't do that. - Why not? We already borrowed money for the bond. How are we gonna pay for the lawyer? I'll talk to Ms. Jacci, okay? Don't worry about it. Give me the keys. We barely have enough money. I can't support two babies on my own. Kathy, you're not responsible for him. Yes, I am! This isn't right, what's happening to him. This is all too much for you. Well, they're trying to deport him. - He's American. - No, he's not, Kathy. - He's not American. - What do you mean? You know he was adopted. Hey, baby girl. Are you okay? I'm okay. You? I'm good. Are you getting kicked out? Nah, baby girl. I ain't going nowhere. Tattoo! Tattoo! Who want a New Orleans tattoo? See you tonight. Oh. Oh, baby. Tattoo! Tattoo! Who want a tattoo?! I live on the other side of the river. I'm just trying to make some money. - Hey, you want a tattoo? - No, bro. - No, thank you. - Who wants a tattoo?! Y'all want a tattoo? Hey, who want a tattoo? Hey. Antonio? Oh, yeah. At the hospital. Right? - Yeah. How are your girls? - H-Hey. Excuse me. Hey. Hey. Tattoo. Yeah, y'all want some tattoos? Y'all look like you're in love. Sir. Tattoo. You want a tattoo? Come on, man. Hey. Hey, come on, man. How-how about I put a nice eagle on your back. - Okay? - I don't need it. - Come on. You know, you could get a tattoo... - No. Come back to the quarter, get yourself a nice date. Hey, come on. I'll do it for cheap. Hey! I'll do it for cheap! I'll have a tattoo! You for real? You gonna give me a tattoo or not? Uh... okay. Um, but how'd you get here? Uh, bus. You scared of motorcycles? No. Okay. Well, you know... Yeah, I only got one helmet for now, but, uh, you know, y-you could wear mine and then I could... Here. Yeah, you take this. Stevie. Put that down, huh? All right, guys. Come on. Put the balls away. Time for lunch. Good job. Good hustle. It ain't right, how Kathy treats you. I didn't ask for your help. I was just trying to help you, trying to put him in his place. I don't solve my problems like you, Denny. Okay? That's our difference. Well, because of what I did, you're probably gonna get to see your daughter all the time. What you mean? He's getting deported. Yeah, he's a fucking illegal. Kathy! Kathy. Kathy, you're not - taking my daughter. Kathy. - I'll be right back. No, no, no, no. You can't come in here. Are you gonna touch me like...? Take your hands off me. - What are you doing here? - Oh, you gonna deal with me, huh? - Yeah, I'm gonna deal with you. - Kathy, I told you all I want - to do is talk to her. - Shut up and stop talking. That's all I want. What makes that so difficult, huh? You can't come to my work and do this. I can't? It's been three months. Three fucking months, Kathy. - It's bullshit. - I'm not forcing her. You can't just decide if you want to be part of her life... It don't matter! It don't matter whether... I-If she wants to or not. You need to let me see my daughter. It's not my fault she doesn't want to spend time with you. - That's the situation you created. - It's my right. - You weren't around. - It's my right. She don't know you. Get out. You better not think of leaving this country with her. We're not going anywhere. You're the one who created this mess. I'll go back to court if I have to. Oh, look, you need to get out. - You need to get out! - All right? - You need to get out of here! - Okay? - Get out of here. - Okay. - Want to get started? - Mm-hmm. Okay. So what you want? You want a dolphin? You want a Rose? You want... "Thug life" on your stomach? What you want? I want a Fleur-de-lis. Oh, fuck, you serious? Why? What's wrong with that? Oh, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just, you know, you from New Orleans. It's like getting a palm tree if you're from California. Well, that's what I want. Okay. Where you want it? Um, on my wrist. - Right here? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, ma'am. You ready? Okay. Oh... - You okay? - Yeah. So, why a Fleur-de-lis? Um, it's my favorite flower. Do you know what kind of flower it is? Never thought about it. Thought it was cliché. You born here? - No, Vietnam. - Mm. Where's that? I'm kidding. I see y'all around. You remember anything? Um, I remember the Fleur-de-lis. Oh, they got that over there? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. For your information, a Fleur-de-lis is a water Lily. I used to look at them in the delta next to my village. I told myself if I ever get a tattoo, that's what I would get... A Fleur-de-lis. So why now? 'Cause I'm dying. What? You thought I was wearing this wig for fun? How much I owe you? It's on me. What? No, no, no, no. I want to pay for this. Here, take it. No, you know, I ain't gonna take your money. Put it back. You can't offer a service and not take the money. We can stand here and argue all day. But I ain't gonna take your money. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Do you have a business card? I get together with my family once a month for a big cookout. You're gonna come and eat. Bring your family, too. Don't even think about not showing up when I call you. - I'm serious. - Yes, ma'am. Yeah! Bitch-ass, where q at? - Oh, lord! - What's up? What are you here for, bro? Come on, what you here for? Y'all busy these days? Nah, bro. You been doing too good, man. And your girl not about to kill me, so I don't... - I don't think I could... - I'm getting deported. You know, I need money for a lawyer. Fuck. Hey, come on. We gonna figure something out, bro. Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. What? What did you do? What's going on? Why's her hair look like that? She said she wanted to have the same hair color as you. - I hate it! - Why is it bleeding down her face like that? She did that all on her own. Okay. Calm down, okay? We're gonna wash it now. It's okay. It's okay. Come here, baby. Come here, come here, come here. Hey, Jessie, it don't look that bad. - Yes, it does! - Jessie, it don't look that bad. That's what I've been saying, okay? - It looks interesting. - Hey. Hey. Jessie. Hey. Hey. Hey. It look like, um, it look like one of them movie stars. - Yeah, you do. - Really? Like, uh, uh... - Who? - Uh, well, what's her name? - Uh, Kim... - Kim? - Kim. - Do you know Kim? Kardashian? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah! - You totally do. Look at you. - Kim Kardashian, that's the one. - Look at you. - You look like her. - You're so pretty. Only a confident person can have a hair color like that. I mean, I wish I could change my hair like that. - Oh, come on. - Okay. - No, I-I take that back. - Uh-huh. - Hmm. - Oh. I mean, I didn't mean right... hey. Come on, don't walk at me like that. Don't walk at me like that. Don't... Oh, no! Hey, hey. Come on, have some mercy, okay? How about let's change it to black? - Okay? - It already is black. - We're not going to do that. - How about, uh... Come on, help me out here. Daddy needs to keep his promise now. - Okay. - Yeah. I think... What are we gonna do? Jessie? What color? That one? - Oh, come on. - Perfect. - Get that in there, okay? Both... yeah. - Oh, it's a lot. - Oh, man. - Okay. Use both of your hands and just get in there. This is like spreading with butter. I like that. You like your new hair? - I feel so confident. - Oh. You know I'd go to the moon with you, right? I ain't scared. Man, I want to see the pyramids and shit. Cave drawings and shit. Fuck your pyramids, bro. - Hey, fuck you, man! - Man, if I'm on vacation, I ain't trying to see no fucking pyramids, riding around in the Van and shit, bro. - What the fuck you trying to do? - Trying to be on a motherfucking beach sipping a motherfucking Mai Tai. Fuck that Mai Tai. You don't even know what the fuck a Mai Tai is. Always talking about a damn Mai Tai. Don't worry about it, motherfucker. I just want to drink the shit, how about that? Yo, Antonio!

All right? Do you have any ailing relatives - that require your assistance? - Uh, no. How about children under the age of 18 that would be left alone here if you were to depart? Uh, yeah, yeah. I got a-a stepdaughter and I got a daughter on the way. But would they be left alone? Uh, no. Okay, um, it looks like you work. Yeah. So you're not the sole provider. Uh, no. We both work. Oh. Okay. And you, um, didn't come here as a refugee, so there's no threat of violence in your homeland. So that doesn't apply. Okay. It looks like our best bet here is, uh, to try to prove that you are a valued member of society. Which is going to be quite a challenge because of your criminal record, but at this point, it's-it's all... It's the only option we have. Now, we're gonna need a lot of support here. All right? Friends, family, uh, parents. Uh, members of your church if you attend one. Anybody that can paint a picture for the judge that you're a positive part of this community. Yeah, we can get some people together. Good. Um, how about your adoptive parents, Antonio? They passed away. Oh, okay. Any other family members from your parents' side? - Uh, aunt, uncle, grandparent? - Uh, no. Okay, so we'll just have to go with what we got. Were you able to put together the retainer fee? So, uh, we were... Uh, yeah, uh... I was able to get an advance from work. - Man, how you did that shit? - Man, I told you, man. Ain't no way that's the same bike. You must've did some voodoo to this shit. What the fuck you think I do here, merk? I thought you just swept, I didn't know you worked on 'em. And you got to pay for this shit. - Pay for it? - This ain't no charity shop, merk. If you're gonna charge me for it, you could've cleaned - the motherfucker first. - Hey, hey, shut that bike off! I'll impound that shit so fast. Get over here. Can I help you officers with something? Shut the fuck up. What the fuck you doing here? You illegal motherfucker, ain't they kick you out yet? - You got a problem, bro? - Who the fuck are you? - Ice, bitch. Who are you? - I don't give a fuck. I should write you a ticket for disturbing the peace. - Write me a ticket? That's cute. - Yes, sir. Just like that coconut you're walking around with. Yeah, I'm real cute, ain't I? You guys hear anything about a dealership getting hit a few days ago? - No, sir, we don't know... - What'd I fucking tell you? Keep your mouth shut. I'm talking to this motherfucker. You're still getting deported? - Getting what? - Oh, shit. You didn't even know your own friend was getting deported. Damn, they must be training you good over at ice. Hmm? If you do get deported, Jessie stays here. Now, I don't give a shit what you do with your own kid. But Jessie stays here. I know you stole those bikes. Come on, Denny, let's go. I still owe you a good beating. You all came. This is it. Uh, where's your restroom? It's in the hallway, to the right. Thanks for inviting us. We're happy to have you. Oh, is that, - is that soup? - That's soup. - Right. - That's pineapple soup. - Pineapple soup? - Pineapple soup. With okra and fish sauce. The okra I know. That's my mom. - There? - Mm-hmm. Who's this? My older brother. Lilies were my mom's favorite flowers. When we escaped from Vietnam, our dad decided to split us up on two boats. They didn't make it. We came to the U.S. as refugees. Why'd your dad split y'all up? Better chance that half of us live. I like your hair. You ever eat this stuff before? Mm-mm. Mmm. It's really good. It's really good. My dad says you have a kind face. Good, good. Good. Good. Good. Being here make me feel like I'm somewhere else. Like I'm in Asia or something. Kathy used to always ask me if I remember my time before I came to the U.S. I told her no. But that was a lie. I remember my mom. You remind me of her. What? Come up and sing a song.

I don't understand what you're saying, - but I'm trying to help you. - Uh-huh. Just... you have to hold on to this, okay, in order for me to help you walk. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. Uh-huh. Antonio, I know that you, um, you said that your adoptive parents were not around, but I did some digging into your records and found out that your foster mother is still alive. You need to tell susanne to come to the hearing. I told her the hearing was next week, but I couldn't get her to agree over the phone. She said she wants you to come in person and talk to her. Yeah, of course. We'll go today. Good. She's about two hours away. - In St. francisville. - I can't do that. Look, it's all I could do to convince the judge to get you another hearing. - This is your last chance. - No, she don't need to be there. What are you talking about? We need everyone we can get. We need her to come, Antonio. You're running out of choices. Well, what about merk, hmm? I got a friend, he work for ice. What about, what about merk? - That's not enough. - He's enough! He's not, he's-he's not enough. We need to send the strongest messaging to the judge... - Fuck messaging. No, fuck that! - Do you want to keep - our family together or not? - No, I don't want her there! - We need this. - I don't want her there! The people that you have coming are your friends. Susanne is your parent. She ain't my fucking parent. Yeah, that's right, because you told me she was dead. Okay, come on, guys, look, look. I know this is hard. I've done a lot of these cases, and it brings up the past. It's painful. You need to tell her to come to the hearing. No, fuck that. I won't do it. How come you didn't tell me? Hey! Antonio, I'm talking to you! Were you ever gonna tell me?! You have to talk to her. If you want to stay, you have to. Hey! Wait a minute. - You got my money? - I don't got the money, Ms. Jacci. You better have my money. I don't got the money, Ms. Jacci! Okay? Let me get you straight. No money, no job. I don't got the money. No job? Okay. - Pick up this shit and get out. - Okay, I'll pack my shit and I'll leave. What you doing here? I came here for another tattoo. What you think this is, huh? Free therapy? You think getting a tattoo gonna save your life? Leave. Hey, Jessie. Hey, Jessie. Hey. Hey, d... hey. Hey. Hey, where you... hey, hey, where you going? Where you going? I ain't gonna hurt you. I ain't gonna hurt you. I'm your daddy, okay? How you doing? How was school? Listen, I need, I need to tell you something. Okay? I need you to listen, really hear me. Okay? I know I messed up. And I-I know I-I shouldn't have left y'all. And I'm really sorry. Okay? But I'm gonna make up for it. Okay? I promise. Jessie. Come here. Hey. You okay? You know, at some point, we're gonna have to figure this out. You can't keep her from me forever. If Antonio gets deported, I'm filing for custody. And there's no way no judge is gonna think you taking her is a good idea. And what if I do, huh? What if I do take her? You know he's been stealing motorcycles again, right? Let's go. Hey. Hi, Jessie. Hi, dad. I got you some flowers. Y'all ain't gonna talk to me? Kathy? Who is that? It's my mom. - What is she doing here? - What do you mean? Kathy. I'm gonna get a few things together. - Okay. - What's she talking about? - We're done. - Hey, what's she talking about? Come here. Yeah. Is there anything you want to tell me? What you mean? Okay. It's okay. It's okay. You, you can talk to me. - Yeah, I know... - Yeah. - Yeah, I know that. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Yeah. Have you been meeting up with q? No. No. No, Kathy. Hey. Hey. What's going on? - Hey, Kathy, what's going... - You're a fucking liar! Fucking... fucking lying to me. Hey. You think I'm fucking stupid? I-I knew jacci didn't give you that money. Hey, come on. Hey, let me talk to you. - Don't touch me. - No. Hey. No. Hey, Kathy, let me, let-let me, let me talk to you for... - I'm done! I am done. - For one second. How was I supposed to get that kind of money, okay? What was I supposed to do? Yeah, I'm trying to keep the family together. No, you're not. We needed a lawyer, so I got the goddamn money, Kathy. You think I care about the money?! I would g... I would go with you to... To anywhere if you had tried. But you... you won't even talk to your mom. That's crazy. Do you see how crazy that is? You won't even talk to her to stay here, but you think stealing is the right way? You don't know what you saying. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - You don't know what you saying, no. It's simple. You won't even talk to your mom and ask her to come so you can be with your family. How come you never told me? How are we married when I don't even know that your mom's alive? - I don't know you. - Yeah. Yeah, you don't know me. Okay? You don't know nothing about that. Okay? Okay, you don't, you don't want to know that the people who brought me here... You don't want to know that the people who brought me here gave me up after six months, okay? You don't want to know that I went from foster home to foster home and-and when I... - You never told me that. - I know, and when I finally thought I ended up with some parents, okay, that man beat the shit out of me every goddamn day and she didn't do shit about it! And you want me to go back there and beg her. No, you want me to go back... She ain't gonna help me, okay?! If she didn't help me before, she ain't gonna help me now! - It's time to go, Kathy. - Dawn! Get the fuck out my house. Come on, Kathy. You need to leave. Well, you never told me. Get in the car, baby. Coming, daddy? Nah, baby girl. Go with your mama. Jessie, let's go. You done fixing that man? Just go. When did Henry die? About ten years ago, give or take. I'm here to ask you, uh, if you'll come to a merits hearing for me. They're trying to deport me. Will you come? Susanne? You just have to show up and talk to the judge, that's it. Susanne. I am just asking you for this one thing. Will you come? Why'd you have me come all the way over here? I don't know. Okay. You want to know why I left? 'Cause when we used to get beat up together, I always tried to protect you. And that day I asked you to leave with me, you stayed. You never chose me. Susanne, you never chose me. That's all I wanted. You okay? Your body holding up? Uh-huh. Your dad don't mind I'm doing this? He's just happy that I'm happy. You think he'd mind if I ask him something? He doesn't mind. Can you ask him if he regrets splitting y'all up on two boats? Never. Do you know why I like the Fleur-de-lis, Antonio? Because water lilies look like they have no roots. But they do. They can't survive without them. Hmm. When I was 12... Henry, my dad... He told me I got a letter from my real mama. At first, I didn't believe him because why would she send me a letter after all that time? He kept talking about it. Every day. He asked me if I wanted to see it; I told him no. But when I finally asked if I could... He told me he threw it away. Like it was nothing. But then I found it. What did it say? It was written in broken English, so it was hard to read, but... It said she tried to drown me. She held me under that water. I guess she couldn't go through with it, so she gave me up. She kept me as long as she could. It's okay. You have to put it on. Just for a little bit. Okay. Faster. This is your daughter. Hey, Jessie. Come here, it's okay. Come here. I talked to susanne. My mom. You did? She ain't coming. That's it? You three? Where's Antonio? What are you doing here? If Antonio stays, Jessie stays. Thank you. All rise. Court is now in session. The honorable judge Adams presides. You didn't think I was gonna pay you back, did you?! Don't you dare. Come on. Let's go to your room. I got to go. Got to go. Hey. You drive. I'm gonna take all that leftover shit... Fat, lard, dick, ears... From all different animals, and I'm gonna stuff it in goddamn intestines. That's how they make sausage? Huh? I can't believe I've been eating that shit. Now, when I eat it, all I can think about is... Denny, can you shut the fuck up?! For just one goddamn minute in your fucking life! All right. Jesus. I was just sharing. You're welcome, by the way. What you mean? I took care of him. Took care of... what you mean? - What you talking about? - I told you. I told you I'd take care of him. Me and a few friends, we found him at a diner. So we picked him up, took him out to the woods, beat the shit out of him. I thought we killed him. You should've seen him. He kept going, like, uh... "No, no, please stop it. "I have to go to court. Please, please. Let me go to court." I'm like, "nah, you ain't going to court." Actually, it's kind of funny when you think about it, because... We're always trying to put 'em in court, huh? Hmm. - Oh, Denny. - What? I'd like to shake your hand. - All right. - Yeah. Huh. There we go. What are you...? Hey. Come on. What is this? Ace, come on. Stop being silly, now. - We got to go to work. - Look at me. What? You're going to fucking jail. What? What? Hey. Hey. Hey, you better think about what you're doing! We're supposed to stick together! You just fucked up, ace! Fucking sh... Oh, this motherfucker. He better be bluffing, his ungrateful ass. What the fuck?! You know what the hell you did to us?! - What? No. What'd I do? - Huh?! - Say something, you piece of shit! - Fuck! Fuck! Stupid fucking ass! You don't know what you did to us! Hey, Kathy, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Fuck. My brother. Take care of yourself, man. I will. Last time I saw my mom, she didn't want to let me go. She held me tight. That's what I remember. We always want the best thing for our families, Antonio. It just don't always turn out the way we thought. Good morning, bro. Look, man, I know you're busy, but I need to know if an Antonio leblanc checked in today. Hold on. Yeah, he's here. Can you tell me who's escorting him? It look different in the morning. I see why you like it out here. It's beautiful. If you run... I won't catch you. - Love you, brother. - Okay. Miss, you're gonna follow me. Ma'am. Ma'am. - Ma'am, you have to follow me, okay? - No. You can't. Can't. - They gone, ace. - What? - They-they left already. - Who left? Did Jessie go? - Yeah. Yeah, they're all... - Where'd they go? - They all gone to the airport. - Shit. - You might catch them. - Shit. Come on, Jessie. Come here. Hurry up. Antonio! Antonio! Excuse me. What are you doing here? We're going with you. Sir, you can't leave your car there. Sir! Okay. Come on. Come on, come on. This is my family. Okay. Okay. Excuse me. - Okay. - Sir, next. Come on, let's go. Oh, excuse you. Stop! Jessie! - Oh, my god. - Jessie! Hey, buddy. Excuse me. Jessie! I just want to say goodbye to my daughter. Okay. Okay. Say goodbye to ace. Hey. I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. Can I have a hug? Yeah? I'll see you, baby, okay? I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Y'all need to stay. What? No. - What are you... - No, Kathy. Y'all need to stay. - No, w-we're coming with you. - Yeah. - We're going with you. - No, no, I have, I have to go by myself, okay? Jessie wants to be with you. I want to be with you. - I know. - We're going with you. We're family. - We're family. - I know. Just listen to me, okay? I don't even know where I'm gonna stay at. I'll go first. I'll get everything set up, and y'all meet me there later. Don't-don't do this. - We're... - It's-it's for the kids. Kathy, it's for the kids, okay? - It's gonna be okay. I promise. - We'll-we'll come. We'll come. Give me the baby. Give me the baby. Jessie, I got to go, okay? Come on. You had your time. Come on. Okay. I love you so much. I love you so much. Okay. Okay. Don't go! Please! - Don't go! - Hey! Please! - Just stay with us! - I would stay for you, I would. - You've had your time, sir. - I would stay for you, I would. - Stop! We want you to stay! - Jessie. Hey, everything's gonna be fine. Hey, everything's gonna be okay. I'll see you soon. I choose you! I choose you! Please, daddy! Don't leave me! Please! I choose you, too. I choose you, too. - Mr. Leblanc, let's go. - I can't stay. No, I choose you! I choose you! I can't. I can't stay. I can't stay. Jessie, he's got to go now. No. No! - No! - It's gonna be okay, all right? - Hey! Hey! Hey! Take it easy. - Daddy! She won't let go. - Let him go. - Don't leave me! Daddy! - Please, daddy! - You have to let go. No! Don't go, daddy! Don't! Please! No! Stop! - It's okay. - Don't take my daddy! - Don't! - It's okay. Please, don't go, daddy! Don't! Please don't take my daddy!
