Let's skin him out. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How sweet the sound... ♪ Colter, Paiute! [WOMAN] Here on Goose Creek, I first saw him with woman. End of fall. Winter was coming. Trees and leaves gave me answer. Gold and red was on forest. First snow came and went. He frightened me. Only seen one white man before. When I was ten, my father traded with one for cloth at Williamson river. I was gathering firewood for cooking. We were here two days, all women and children, our warriors on attack with Modocs on a river named after white man. Call it "Rogue." We call it "swift one." [BELLS JINGLE] Hello. Hey, good morning. This your place? Oh, yeah. Kinda something, ain't it? Uh, you mind if this Indian woman sit down over there in the corner and warm up? Oh, I'd be real hurt if she didn't. You hear me? You come on in here. Go on, now. Got her all settled down there. My name's Matt. Uh, what? Matt. Matt. I'm Tolbert. Hello, Tolbert. Glad you could stop by. What can I do for you? Well... I need a few things. That's what I'm here for. Where you headed? I'm going up the road. Trapping? Yeah. And I need... Oh, I don't know what I need. Well, I'll tell you one thing you're gonna need for sure. A piece of rawhide to tie that hair you're on with. [COUGHING] My friend... I've come across the Great Divide and all the Rocky Mountains, and I still have it on my head, as you can plainly see. My friend, you ain't crossed Paiute country yet, neither, as I can plainly see. Pi... what...what's that? Paiute. [MATT] Payoot? [TOLBERT] Paiute. That's funny, 'cause she sa-- Oh, could I have something warm for her to drink? Mm-hmm. Uh... kind of stout? Mmm...why not? Hot coffee and rum. Rum? Mm-hmm. Uh... you ain't got any whiskey, do you? Lookee here. [CHUCKLING] You know, you're not a bad man to run onto, are you? You betcha. I would like one of those. You're gonna get one. Coffee's right over there. [CLEARS THROAT] That'll be 15 cents. Well, you can pay me when you get back over here. [CHUCKLES] I forgot about that. Yep. And there's coffee. You know, she said something about that when we passed a camp yesterday. Indian camp, you know? She said that. "Paiute." One of them squaws saw us. They didn't do nothing. I mean, what's so special about them? It ain't squaws you got to worry about. It's the men you got to hide from. You don't believe it. Look right here. Let me show you something. Look at that. Look right there. About six years ago, them damn Paiutes jumped me one morning when I was setting some traps. How far does that go? Way down there. Healed up good though. It just pinched right together. It's a long way from your heart. What did the other fellow look like? Well, I kept one of them's head on a stick out back for the rest of that winter. [LAUGHS HEARTILY] Come summer, though, he started to thaw out on me. He did. Just thawed. Began to stink so, I finally had to throw him away. [LAUGHS] Yeah. Uh...how's the... trapping been up there in them lines for the fellas for beaver and mink? Trapping's been real good. I mean, more mink and more beaver this year than ever I seen. I suppose that means that... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] there's going to be a lower price for the hide, huh? Oh, lots of hides does bring down the prices. What is that? That, uh, that real pretty new rifle over there? What the hell is it? That's a Henry... Repeater. Huh? A re...repeater. What do you mean? I mean it'll fire 15 times before you have to reload it. [LAUGHS] All right, you're a trading man. Now listen, I'm going to need about six number four traps. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look at that. Look here, now. That's .44 caliber. It'll fire 15 times. You don't got to do nothing but pull this here down. I... I need things, now. Come on. Don't make jokes and... Yeah... plug your ears! Just plug your ears! Plug your ears! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Yeah. .44 caliber, it'll fire 15 times, my friend. Could... may I hold that for a minute? Yeah. Careful. Brand-new. How in the hell does this work? Push. Push that thing. Push it down. See the shell-- What-- [GASPS] You! Fire, right over that way. Yeah, yeah, right over there. [GUNSHOT] [TOLBERT] Do it again. Push that thing down. My God. Go get 'em. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHS] I better hold that. I better-- yeah. Now-- now, wait. W--wait a minute. What do they get for those? It'll take a $20 gold piece to get that rifle. Well, I haven't got a $20 gold piece. Now... I've got a fine Hawken here. It shoots straight as an-- you... you look like a trading man, aren't you? Got a whole rack full of Hawkens. I want it, trader. Well, why don't you come on back and look at it from time to time? It'll be right over here. $20 is all it takes. You keep that here, 'cause I'm gonna be back for it. [MATT] Fifteen times without reloading it. You wouldn't have been scared and hurt and everything. You wouldn't have lost your friend. God! Fifteen times... A Henry Repeating rifle. There'd have been a dead bear and... a live horse. [woman] A brave reached camp. told of battle between our warriors and Modoc people and river of swift water. Many hurt, some killed. We were to meet and bury warriors before second sun. It's hard for me this time. Two days before, I lost my new son of only one moon to Great Fever. Come on! Whoa! [Matt] Now, that's funny. I don't know. Old Patrick Shay, gave me that map to rendezvous. He didn't say anything about the cabin being torn down. I'll build a fire up here. You know, I've never asked you before. Where did you... get that name, Little Doe? Mother gave. "Mother gave." No, uh... Now say. My mother... My mother... gave it... gave it... to me. to... me. My mother gave it to me. My mother gave it to me. Good girl. You see how-- like these... things are notched already and hewn and stuff? That's 'cause there was a cabin before. The thing just fell down here. It's not gonna take any time at all to put it right back up. It's going to be a lot of work, but... we're going to pull them up, put it right up there, where it used to be. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] Make a house. Fine house. Like some of the ones I showed you in St. Louis, huh? Hyah! [NEIGHING] Get up! Now... come here. [ AMAZING GRACE PLAYING] Come on with the mud! Come on, strong, strong, strong. Stop it! Stop that! Stop that! [LAUGHING] Stop that! Colter, stop! [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [PLAYING AMAZING GRACE] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Uh, why don't you get my coat? I'm going to run that trap line up on that upper creek. And when I get back-- [HORN BLARING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] The Paiute. That's Paiute. What the hell do they want around here? Boston man! [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Uh-uh. What do you want? [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [WOMAN] It was him and pretty woman again. I did not expect to see them. Parley! [woman] I say nothing of seeing them in forest. Now maybe I should have. It was like the spirit trying to say something to me about my own son through him and pretty woman with child. I felt coldness through my body as I watched them. [CHANTING IN PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [CHANTING] [WHOOPING] [CHANTING] Well, they're leaving. They will return. I feel I know why they are here, yet I cannot say. Well, how do you know? You mean, uh... You understand it? Paiute? Paiute? You speak-- You understand it? No Paiute. How do you know what's going on? It's that hill. Spirits in the wind each day blow around me and my child. Spirits? What do you mean? What kind of spirits? Now, listen here. You're acting like you know what's going on here. You've got to tell me. You know I don't understand everything about your people. You got to make me understand it. Spit it out, woman! Hill. Sacred ground. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Sac... sacred, you mean like, uh... graveyard? Like... burial ground? [SIGHS] Well, I'm a damn fool. Well, that's got to be it, then. All of them women with them travois tied behind the horses, they... there ain't no tribe bringing a bunch of women on a raiding party. they're coming here to bury their dead, huh? No one... will stand between our dead warriors and great spirit. No one! [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [CHANTING] [CHANTING] Oh, Lord. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [WHOOPING] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [WHOOPING] All right. I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to just pack up a few things and get the hell off this mound. Right now. [GROANING] What's the matter with you? Baby pain. Baby pain? Oh, honey. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] You wouldn't go have that now, would you? Please don't have that right now. [WHOOPING] Please don't have that right now, please. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SIGHS] When they come back, I'm going to have to go down there and meet with them to somehow figure out a way to make them understand that you just cannot be moved yet. [KISSES] You say your prayer now for the child to be... strong. Sun coming up. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [WHOOPING] [SCREAMING] Huh? Huh? Huh? [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [CHANTING] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] I'll get you to water. Get out of my way! [SHOUTING IN PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] You hear me? Get out of my way! Huh? Huh? [MOANING] Huh? [CRYING] [CHANTING] [GROANING] [LITTLE DOVE GRUNTING] Uh-uh, uh-uh. Push! Push! [CHANTING] [MATT] Push! [GASPING] Now... Now! Push! [GRUNTING] Push! [LITTLE DOVE GROANING] Come on. Push! [LITTLE DOVE GROANING] Again! [BABY CRIES] That is a good sign, for he has given new life back to this sacred place. [BABY CRIES] My child! She's dead! You've killed one of your own kind! [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [AMAZING GRACE PLAYING] The Lord is my shepherd... I shall not want. [BABY COOS] I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Hey, Prairie Fox, it's me, Lum Witcher! I'm coming in! I bet you didn't expect a surprise from me, eh? I've got some fish for you, Prairie Fox! Are you ready? [CHUCKLING] Coming in, Prairie Fox. Howdy, Prairie Fox? I'm coming in. Warm up one of them squaws for me. [LAUGHS] Howdy there, Prairie Fox? Ain't seen you since last summer. I got some bear claws here for you. And I got you a Cheyenne scalp. I know you'd like that. Uh... What the hell's going on? I gave you a fair deal when I traded with you last year over on the Rogue. I was gonna give you a better deal this year. Hell, I got some fancy claws here from a trading post up on the Hudson Bay for you and your women. You're out of your damn mind. Hyah! [HORSE NEIGHING] [LAUGHTER] Hey, hold up there! Lum Witcher. Colter. Where you headed? Back there where you come from. Man, don't go down there. There's a Paiute war party out there. Somebody I've been trading with. I've traded with them Paiutes for eight years. Now I ain't never been treated so unhospitable. You don't talk much, do you? I'll be damned if you ain't as touchy as them Paiutes. Whole world's going to hell. North America fighting South America. The Paiutes stop trading with me. Now in the middle of nowhere, I meet a stranger with a chip on his shoulder. Which side you on, the North or the South? I don't understand that. Where'd you come from when you come out here? Three hundred miles south of St. Louis, about the 1st of June. Damn, you're an enemy! You're from the South! Get them hands up! Cock that and I'll blow your throat out. Oh. [CLEARS THROAT] [BABY CRIES] What the hell you got there? A human child. What did you think it was, a little baby buffalo or something? Hell, man, I stump broke many a buffalo in my day. I once kept a buffalo cow tied up behind my cabin for three years. Fed her the first year. Fell in love with her the second year. The third year, I shot her and ate her. [LAUGHS] [BABY CRYING] Unwrap that thing. Let me take a look at it. I'll be damned. It's a-- It's a real baby. What you been feeding it? A little berry juice. Berry juice? Hell, man! You can't feed a baby like that, just berry juice. Kid like that's got to be breast-fed to survive. I still do! [LAUGHS] You say you run onto a Paiute war party up there somewhere? Yeah, about a mile down that creek there. You know, I've been trading with that sub-chieff Prairie Fox for a long time now. But I come across him by midday today, and he ran me off. You better take that kid of yours and get through that pass there. You can make Fort Klamath in about five days. The child won't survive five days. Come on. You know, when we hooked up, you said something about the North fighting the South. What is that? There's a war going on down there out of these mountains People killing their own kind. Ain't you heard about it? No. Just as well. People gone crazy. You know, they call it a civil war. You tell me, what's civil about a man killing his own kind? [BABY CRYING] Come on. Uh... Ever think about asking Prairie Fox to have his women help you with feeding the young 'un? Huh? Prairie Fox always travels with his women. One of them had a kid a few months back. I've seen her when I ran onto them this morning. She's a looker. How old is the child? Old enough to be off her breast, that's for sure, if it's alive. Paiutes lost a whole bunch of kids to yellow fever a while back. If I was to go in there and talk to Prairie Fox about his woman feeding my child, how would I recognize the woman from all the others? Now, why are you asking that? 'Cause he's going to starve to death, and I'm in a hurry. For whatever reason you're asking, she'd be in the only lodge they got set up. The Paiutes only set up one lodge when they're having a burial party. And she'd be the only looker in the lodge. The rest of them would all be my kind. [LAUGHS] Now, if I was to go in there and ask old Prairie Fox about him letting his woman feeding my child, how would I go about that? Go in the morning. You go in real polite, real slow, and real easy. Yeah. I'll go real polite, real slow, real easy. [HUMMING] Busha, we give you thanks... for you have given us everything. They did not listen to the voices of nature. They destroyed the trees, wounded the earth, scattered the game. The white man's law is the thunder sticks that kill us. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Hyah! Hyah! [GUNSHOT] [BABY CRYING] [MATT] If you don't stop your damn squalling, you ain't gonna die of natural causes. You're going to die of mountain man-choking. How I ever get myself in these messes, I'll never know. Why your Pa wanted me to wait out here in the damn cold, I can't figure out. In the meantime, shut up. Here comes your dinner, and about time. [WHOOPING] Get down! Come over here behind these horses. [YELLS] Get down. Tell her to feed the child. Feed it! Feed the child! Take my advice, Injun, you'll give that baby some of your breast. I wouldn't waste a lot of time, either! [LAUGHS] Tell her in Paiute. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SCREAMING] Feed it! [BABY CRYING] [WHOOPING] You got a pack of trouble coming. If you talk Paiute, you should tell him if he comes any closer, I'm gonna blow his head off. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] What's he saying? You got trouble, all right. I don't figure he's gonna leave here without his woman. I'm gonna send him his woman on the back of a travois, dead behind your horse the minute he comes any closer. Now you tell him. My horse? Tell him! You realize if they decide to rush us, we only got two shots between us. Yeah, one's gonna be for her and the other's for you if you don't straighten this out right now. Why don't I just tell him as soon as she finishes feeding the baby, she'll go back to him? I'm taking the baby to Fort Klamath, and when I make sure that it's safe, I'm gonna release her. So you just tell him that. Yeah. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Now what's he saying? He says he ain't leaving until he gets his woman and the baby. He figures the baby belongs to them. No! Take it and ride. Take it! Don't see why I get stuck with the damn baby. Them Paiutes they're never gonna trade with me again! I don't know what you did to make them think the baby's theirs. [BABY CRYING] You leave me alone! Come on! [WOMAN SCREAMS] Come on! Come on! You do not follow me! I'll blow her head off! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! I guess this is about as good a place as any for me to be leaving you. I don't know what you've done to Prairie Fox, but I'm going to get out of here while I can. What's the big hurry? What's the big hurry? I've been hung up with you and your problems for two days now. That's longer than I ever stayed with a squaw. It's your decision. It seems like you'd have a better chance if you stuck with me. Besides, you know old Prairie Fox won't be thinking too highly of you, either, you know. Let me tell you something. He ain't going to stop till he gets his woman. And for some reason, he wants the kid too. You know, I thought when you got the baby fed, you'd just go on to the fort. Why don't you let the woman go? Maybe he'll forget about the kid. Uh-uh. No. I'm gonna keep her with me all the way to the fort... for security. I might not even let her go when I get there, either. [LUM LAUGHS] Well, suit yourself. Your chances are a lot better without me, though. Well, you can make up your own mind. You see, the Paiutes only send one warrior after a lone enemy. It's sort of like a... a code of honor or something. Is that true? I've heard that from somebody. You mean, like, just she and I... she being a woman, they'd only send one? But if it's you and me, they'd send a war party? I'll be damned. I don't think it matters none anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if the only ones that gets out of here alive is the squaw and the baby. Who's gonna take care of you? I've been surviving out here for over 40 years. I still got my hair, and that's without you around! [LAUGHS] Yeah. One thing I don't understand. Never seen a squaw take up with a white baby before. Well, maybe that's 'cause she knows what would happen to her if she didn't. [CHOPPING] What the hell is that? A piece of bark off of a tree. If it's supposed to be a shield, it's kind of heavy, ain't it? Well, I'm trimming it down. I reckon I'll run into you again this winter. You're gonna be trapping up the Rogue, are you? That's none of your business. None of my business. I guess it ain't. You hang on to your hair, and you look after that young 'un. Uh... there's about... 3-400,000 beaver and a whole herd of mink up there around that Paiute burial ground. You go ahead and get them. 'Cause of the kid, I'm gonna get a little late start this year. Well, I'll be damned. What? You mean to tell me you've been hunting and trapping around that mound? I went and rebuilt Williamson's cabin right on top of it. Well, no wonder they're after you. You just don't go fooling around their sacred mounds! I found that out in a very difficult way. It really is time for me to go. You know what you've done? You made 'em mad. You made their spirits mad. The way they look at it, when their dead's restless, they just roam around up there in heaven, and they never get to their happy hunting grounds. I know that. I hope to see you again, friend, and I hope you're alive. Thank you. I hope you're alive! [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] They crossed yesterday. Two ponies say they are camped across river. We attack? No. He will kill her. We might hurt the child. Clouds are gathering. [GEESE HONKING] Wounded Leg is ready. Bring Wannetta and the sacred white child back to me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] Wounded Leg... is dead. We must take the child and kill the tall one. We will stop the tall white one. We will get... the woman... and the sacred child back. Place this in their path. And place the branch of the white snowberry... in its jaws. She will know what she has to do. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You know what that is. Hello! I've great... respect for your medicine! I know that's the shallowest part of the creek and that you know that I was going to come here and cross the creek here and all that. But I'll tell you one thing. That little one... that child... this, you know, baby? Child? That's my child! And I'm not afraid of that at all. This is no disrespect here. Just leave me alone. [GUNSHOT] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Good hunting. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] That's a hell of a shot. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Yeah? Peace. I'll have to save that one. [WINGS FLAPPING] [BABY CRIES] [YELLING] [SCREAMING] [SHOUTING] She has disobeyed us. You have also dishonored me and your people. I do not want to look upon your face again! Such pain. You must go! [SHOUTING] [WANNETTA] No way for me to say how I felt that cold morning. I not speak out against the medicine men of my council. I say, "I, too, been shown way of spirits." No one listened. Prairie Fox made decision. I will remain strong. My spirit will never break. [AMAZING GRACE PLAYS] I got to find a nail. [BELLS JINGLE] Hello. [COUGHING] Where's your woman? Mmm... she been dead... oh, better than a week now. I guess when you get to feeling better, you'll be heading back south? No. No, I'm going back up north to get my boy. The woman had the child? Yes. The Paiutes got him. They'll raise him like one of them. No. I'm going to have to buy a horse off you. I ain't got one to sell. I have to have one. I got one you can use. I would sincerely appreciate that. It's gone! Damn it, it's gone! I told you! I tell you, you help a stranger, he pays me back by stealing my only Henry Repeater and my only damn horse! [WANNETTA] I prayed to great spirit that day. I ask him to give me more strength than I ever received. I was in deep thought, not for me, but for child. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] I'll be damned. Witcher! Witcher. I'll be damned. I'll be damned. Matt! I'll be damned, Matt! Son of a gun! By God! Son of a gun! What the hell are you doing here, Matt? I didn't think I'd ever see you again. It's good seeing you. You damn near didn't. Where's the kid? Oh... the woman run off with him. Figures. How'd she do it? Well...it's kind of a long story. We were going along and come some Paiute medicine-- a skull stuck on a pole in the middle of the creek. There was a bush in his mouth. I blew it all to hell and went on. Was that a horse's skull you come across? I believe it was, yeah. Some kind of a bush in his mouth. Yeah, that's what it is. That's what it is. She's in big trouble. Them was orders for her to kill your horses. See, them Paiute, when a horse goes lame, they take a thorn off a snowberry bush and shove it in one of his veins. Dies quicker than a crow can fly across this river. Well, I'll be damned. So they wanted us afoot, you mean. That's right. She didn't follow orders. I tell you, she's in some kind of trouble. What's gonna happen to her? Most likely she's outcast. Well, do you suppose they're going to take care of my child? Not the woman, I'll tell you that. Probably one of his other women or something. Don't worry. They'll take care of it. For whatever reason it was, they really wanted that kid. Well, we'll find out. It's your doing, if you think it'll work. I think I'll just sit over here and watch. That's the last one. It's going to get real interesting before the day's over. It sure ought to. [GROANS] Dang fool. [FIRE CRACKLING] Won't be long now. Well, then what the hell we gonna do when all them Paiutes come riding in on us and there's just you and me? Kind of uneven, ain't it? Fifteen times. They don't understand that. What you talking about? [BREATHES DEEPLY] Well, lookee what we got here. It worked, all right. There he goes. Probably won't be back till tomorrow morning, and he ain't gonna be alone. No. He will not be alone. [CHANTING] [PANTING] Tall one and crazy one at sacred mound. Make warriors ready. Maybe you ought to take that torch and head up the mound. You know damn well they're watching us. Uh-oh. Told you, you should have been on that mound with that torch! You better wait till they get down that river. Hell with that. Watch this. Six for me, and one for you. Missed him. Six for you and two for me. [CHEWING] [COUGHING] Good morning. Snow. You're eating your breakfast. How can you think about eating at a time like this? It's easy whenever you think it may be your last meal. Hey, didn't I tell you we're gonna have some snow? Didn't know it'd be so damn much. How many he said they gonna send this morning? Well, I don't know. Probably the whole damn Paiute nation. Hey. [BABY CRIES] There's only one of them. Looks like the woman brung back the boy. I'll be damned. They're going to give him back to me. Probably some kind of a trick. You want me to drop him? No! You might hit the child. Hell, I'm better than that. Just keep a bead on her. I'm going to go get the boy. Careful. That ain't no woman. Anything goes wrong, you take that torch and you go burn them dead, you understand? [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Come on across and out of that water. I told you you can't trust him. Watch out, Matt. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] What the hell is he talking about? He's telling you to throw your rifle in the river. You tell him he harms that child, he'd be dead and drowned himself. Better do what he says. He'll kill that kid sure as hell. [CRYING] [GUNSHOT] Damn it, would you hold your fire? [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] Come on out of there. [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING PAIUTE LANGUAGE] [CHANTING] Hey, hey, hey... [IMITATING CHANTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [BABY CRYING] [GRUNTS] Damn. Damn Paiutes. Hyah!
