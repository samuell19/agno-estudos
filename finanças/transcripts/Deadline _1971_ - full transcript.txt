Forward march! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Halt! Aim! Fire! To my daughter, Lena, who gave me the idea. Welcome to what I hope will be a very enjoyable trip. Maybe I should start by telling you about Moelle. It's an old fishing village... ...at the bottom of the hill on Kullaberg Peninsula in northwest Skaane. I'll show you here... Kulla peninsula... Moelle... Nowadays the fishing here is mostly for pleasure. The main source of income is from you... ...the summer visitors during the holiday months. Moelle has permanent population of about 450 people. Are there any real fishermen here at all? It's a bad situation for them. They're on the verge of extinction. The first people in Sweden lived in caves on the other side. Some excavations have been made... ...and lots of utensils which have been found, indicate... ...that a disaster of some kind had taken the people by surprise. Then you had to run a long way... stand in long queues to get something. – Daddy! – Grandpa! Beach Boardinghouse Any success on the golf course today. It was lying this close to the hole, and...! Can I have some of that? Why? - I want to give him... - Not at the table. Look! Go on! A bit more. - Can you pass me a little bit? - Of the herring? - Only ONE potato? - And you're so thin! Grandpa! Grandpa!! Grandpa!! Why isn't your name Olofsson? Ask Mummy what her name was before she was married. Mummy! What was your name before you got married? What did you say? What was your name before you got married? Yes, what was my name?! We're called Olofsson because it'd Daddy's name. Mummy's called that too. Mummy! Do dogs eat flies? Wasps? Haven't you seen him trying to catch flies? Mummy... Mummy! Are we having dessert today? What do we get for dessert, Mummy? Eh? - There'll be no dessert today. - Yes, ice-cream! We have ice cream in the fridge. In a cone! Mummy! Mummy! Do you eat flies? Do I eat flies? No. Can you guess what Uncle Olly ate? Wasps? Bumblebees? That's why I'm so thin. Turn on the radio, so I can hear the weather. We'll go out and look at the boats. Wasn't that funny, when Annika asked about the name? She seemed so confused. – Can we come with you? – How far? – To the crossroads. – Get in then. Kent-Arne, could you pick up some Danish newspapers for me? We can keep up with them! 'Bye! ♫ We must do something ♫ Before the end of the day Hey, Lena... Lena! Can't we go home? I can hardly see you. Hi, Rickard, have you been with Lena and Annika? Let's take a look. Can't they come home on their own? - I'm afraid. - There is nothing to be afraid of. Elsebeth...? You...? I almost didn't see Lena even though she was standing... I hope the skiffs have come in. Annika was scared all the time. Have you been dreaming? I feel sick. Do you have a cough? You feel a bit hot. Crawl in between Daddy and me.. Stig... Move! Goodnight. Do you have to sleep here? Are you feeling off, too? I feel awful. What's up, sweetie? You're hot. I'll get a damp cloth. You're stupid, you can't speak Swedish. You talk and I can't fall asleep. Can you be quiet so I can sleep in peace? How you going? Is it hurting anywhere? Can I listen for a bit? Lie down... put your legs out. That's the way... Now we'll listen. Sore there...? Nope. There...? Little bit. Charlie, phone for you. Berntssons. Can you get up yourself? It was the fishmonger. His mother is ill. She'd called Welander, but he was on a home visit. – County medical officer Eriksson. – This Ringstrom. I'm in Moelle. We seem to have an epidemic here. Welander suggested I ring you. About 15 cases. Gastroenteritis- symptoms and cerebral effects. It's spread across the whole district. It seems to check out. – What do you mean "check out"? What do you mean? Were you expecting this? –In a way. –What is it then? We're in the middle of it here. I've no idea... Can you tell me anything? There's not much you can do. A foreign aircraft, loaded with a new biological weapon... ...has exploded off the coast. So how dangerous is it? Stop! Turn around and drive back. -What has happened? Is it an accident? - Turn the car around and drive back All traffic for Moelle is blocked off. - This is the regular bus. - This also applies to the bus. I live there, my family is there. An epidemic is suspected in Moelle. So no one is allowed to pass either in or out of Moelle. What kind of epidemic? We do not know. I suggest you go to Hoeganäs. Ask the police there for information. We know nothing. We're just blocking traffic. You in the yacht leaving Moelle. Return to port immediately. It's an order. Can I get a cloth. Can you get a cloth? From the kitchen. Come on, Lena! Have you seen my dice? - Have you seen my dice? – Look for them! I have looked. Are you still sick? You were spewing last night. You weren't any better. You filled the loo. They're in the kitchen. Annika says that swallows don't walk on the ground. Can't they? Yes, they can. Go out and look. Are you sure? Really sure? Yes, really... hurry now! Lift yourself up a little. You have to be 3 to have twins? That's what Rickard says, anyway. No, 10. And then you have to be very fast. Can't you go out and play for a bit? Shall I take the kids for a swing? Come and we'll pick some flowers. – Is that you, Elsebeth? Exchange here... Where are you ringing from? A 1412. That's the Hoeganas district. – Hoeganas, yes. – It's just that... – It's hard to ring. – Yes, but... I have to talk to them. This is the only way I can. It's blocked, in connection with the police cordon. – Phone lines are blocked. – Blocked? But I mean ... There must be SOME way to communicate! You will help with the evacuation. You're driving the bus here, right? We shall evacuate Strandbaden, Nyhamnslage, Rekekroken, and Svanshall. We'll split into 3 groups. First group... Kristoffersson. You'll take the western area. Nilsson take the east. Krister takes the only radio car together with Aakesson. You take the central area. Hi. Would you like a coffee? A little more to the right. Is this only for pensioners? Some others will also join. Big smiles! – Good to see you, Kent! – Karin and Liselotte! I know nothing, just that we're going to a camp in Helsingborg. The stock must be put out to pasture, but we don't have time. Hear that, grandad?? Great grandma's in there, isn't she? In all my good time! No one has the right to push me around! Policemen! Just come along, Ma'am. No! We were being shot at from the yard. I've called for tear gas. Janne! It's me, Kent-Arne! I'm coming in! Don't shoot! It's me! Kent-Arne! Hey! This is not a trick! Don't shoot now! It's okay. Everything's under control. It's alright. They'll come this evening. They've a heifer about to calve. It'll be OK. No exceptions... They'll come with us now. Do you think the heifer gives a damn about it? The evacuation continues as planned. However, we've been visited by a working group from the army. For the sake of simplicity, Sven, Adolf and Sten. We'll review all our actions. Arne, would you please update us on police measures? The peninsular is closed off with a line from Nyhamn to Stensnas. From the explosion point and time, and the altitude of the aircraft... ...we've calculated the spread. After an hour, a change of wind pushed the cloud southward. After 5 hours, it reached the peninsular. We have calculated that the strongest risk of infection is here around Moelle. We're counting on this line being well-positioned... ...and that any infection will reach there only after 7 hours... ...and that the risk of infection will have gone away. It seems to be involving a performance-impairing virus. We anticipate the acute symptoms could be over in about a week. That's why we're counting on any significant reaction from the population. Are there any existing medications that may be of use? I'll leave it to Arvid to tell how far he has got in that direction. One difficulty is that we don't know how active this virus is. You get relieved when we manage to get more police here. Go further away, so we can cover a larger area. You must have eye contact with each other all the time! I have asked you to come so we can discuss the situation. Some of you probably don't know what it is that's really happened. But rest assured, nothing dangerous has happened. Everything that is in my power to do so... ...shall be done. Your lives will all soon be back to normal. But what IS this thing? WHAT? I mean... People are sick! The peninsular is closed off. It's police and Home Guard here. We don't know a thing! If you know something, come out with it! Let's keep ourselves calm now. I am, and so should you be. Alright? Okay... The thing simply this... The police have training exercises here as they would have had anyway. It's probably more about the police getting variety than countering viruses. There's a sick girl on the beach. Over there. She was in pain. But the first one sick is already better... Kristin, can you take the kids? See if Bengtsson can come. Well, it's serious, for sure... worse than you and I understand. Locations have been closed off before. In Tampa, in Florida, we were barricaded. Terrible things happened. It must not happen here. Get hold of people in uniform who can guard different places. Lay up a supply of food. People are sick, they have to eat. - They must have food. - An be seen to be well taken care of. I don't think that comes into it. This is serious! Anything can happen. Anything at all. And we must stop it in time. We have to be aware that this could become truly terrible. Hi. I guess you heard that old Mrs Berntsson is dead? So now it's two. Lottie is lying dead down there on the beach. ...but now we're on the safe side. What information have you received? That it's a virus, specifically for humans. Has your presence to do with the nationality of the aircraft? No it hasn't. We're neighbours after all... The rumours have been so strong, of course we needed to be observers. - Was the plane from a NATO country? - It definitely was not Danish. - But was it a NATO plane? - That I don't know. You must know what the plane was. It WAS a NATO plane. It has to be at government level to answer that. Is biological warfare material manufactured in Sweden? Not in any quantity. Not that could be used in weaponry The Defense Research Institute doesn't make weapons. But there are probably ready-to-start plans, full of biological weapons. These are just rumours. We certainly refute them. You say you don't know what it is, but you say it'll be over in a week. How dangerous can such weaponry be? Q-fever has been researched, for example. That just needs five or six virus particles in the lungs... ...for the disease to break out with a likely fatal outcome. About ten grams is enough to kill the entire world's population. Hello. We're here with ambulances and Red Cross staff.... We're grateful you came. You're certainly needed. We have medical stations at the Strand Boarding House, Hotel Kullaberg... ...together with Vita Nova. Dr Ringstrom couldn't get away right now. Dr Welander is up at Vita Nova. Hey... What day is it today? Thursday... the 18th, I think. That was the day I'd promised my brother to go to the liquor store. What'll he say? He thinks I'm sick. But the worst of it is over. It's nice to see you can still stand there and paint. Really? But I'd better try and sort things with my bro. You'll manage. Stop! Calm down, boy. I'm not going anywhere. Stop, or I'll shoot! I want to get a message to my brother. Coming out here was the only way. I said stop! Could you go to the grog shop and get a half litre of Skana? That's his medicine. It's getting cold. Shall we go home? Can't we pick some more flowers? Alright, a few more. Tell me... is that true that everyone in Moelle is infected? Is that why Kent-Arne can't come here? No, he'll come in a couple of days. - Are you infected too? - No, coz I can suck my thumb! I think the fog had the infection. It was in the paper. Is there something everyone can just... There are a lot of things in the paper, Lena. Don't touch me! Then maybe I'll be fine. Lena, come and pick some more! Lena! Now we've been in contact with the researchers who dealt with the virus. We were told it was a mutant. The situation is worse than we thought. All our assumptions are worthless. What does it mean from an action point of view? There must be a total blockade until the situation is clarified. This is what we should have known before. We'll sent in a contingent. Everything's been turned upside down. That means we can expect things to be very different to what we thought. The infection picture has worsened. The first two deaths have occurred. Can you somehow try to... Can you somehow try to outline what is likely to happen? The infection will attack a larger part of the body than we expected. We won't know much until autopsies have been done. We know nothing now, except that it has higher virulence than normal. Can we do anything at all? Unfortunately we already have... This is still a fantastic opportunity to gather information... ...in an area that you never would have expected. We have been given the means for a human trial. A trial using living people. The police protect the researchers! The police protect the researchers! Talk to us! Do you hear that? Come out! – Come out! – Come out! Tell us what's happening with our friends in Moelle! We can't communicate like this. SCIENCE SHUTS UP FOR GENERALS FOR POLITICIANS - FOR MONEY So you make stuff for destruction and then stand back helpless? We don't make stuff for destruction. We're just here to observe. MURDERERS EXPERIMENT WITH US FOR MONEY You and your foreign colleagues have the same interests... The ruling classes' military and political systems! – And you're willing servants! - Now we get into politics... You're lying! Yeah! Crush capitalism! Crush capitalism! Can you listen to me for a moment? You ask a lot of questions. I can't answer them. I'm not going to argue with you. I'll just say one thing...: We'll be doing everything in our power to do whatever we possibly can. All you are achieving here, is to hinder us. Boo! What the hell are you doing here? How did you get through? Shut the door! We've got some damned vermin here. What did you say? We've got some damned vermin here. It's a biological weapon. – Where's Elsebeth? – There's no war, is there? A plane blew up off the coast. It was loaded with that stuff. – Who's that guy? – Someone who knows about it. He'll see what he can do. Have a look what you've done! It's not allowed. Go back. No, I have to talk to you. Come in. Well I'm coming out, then. I need to talk with you. Come on. You have to keep away from me. - You're not sick. - Yes, I am. We're all infected. Not you. I don't believe it. We'll drive from here now. It's best that you and I drive from here. Don't cry! Everything will work out. It's been such a long time. Listen, Kent... Come done here. Your dad is dead. Surely not...?! This is fucking crazy! If you know anything about Lena... - Hey! Where have you been? - Playing. Where have you been? With Eva, painting with felt pens. – Felt pens? Where? – At Eva's. Didn't you look for Lena? - Have you seen Lena? - No. You didn't come across her? Do you know where Lena is? We're very worried about her. Why did the priest say it was an accident that grandpa was shot? He says so to calm us down. But it was not an accident. It was not an accident. Anyone who approaches the border-line is shot. So listen now, Annika. You can not walk near any barricades or guards. - You have to promise! - They're afraid of us. Is it true that the sentry shot himself? So it's said, anyway. Has the mail come? It's delayed. How are things otherwise? Pretty good. But getting worse. Have you seen that What do you mean? You’ve seen newspaper pictures of mass graves in wartime. But here? 23 people died last night. They have to be buried in clay. That'd be right. Don't get attached to your belongings. Throw them away. The frying pan, too. We've nothing left to put in it, anyway. Are you serious? Daddy? Pretend it's you. Yes... What do you want? To talk. What should we talk about? Is it you who painted? Yes. I'm the one who painted. Think it's nice? Messy. Do you think it's messy? Why? - Do you think the colours are strange? - Yes. And my colours? What did you say? And MY colours? I think mummy has them. Ask her to smear the silly colors. - Should I really? - Sing! What should I sing, then? The usual. Which do you mean? "Boil the Kettle". Boil the kettle full... There were three tramps on the road Boil the kettle full There were three tramps on the road The one he was lame the other, he was blind The third has such tattered clothes Have you obtained any medication? Have you seen the newspaper today? It's the fever... Elsebeth... Look. The infection. The same as on my eye, see? Was that why you painted yourself yesterday? We'll paint over this, too I'll go get the kids' colours. Did you see...? A yacht has come in. What? A Dane. Can't understand it. It seems empty. - See anything? - No. There's no one here. Rather strange. Diving outfit. Could be useful... To get away. These are full tanks. - How long can you be under? - 40 minutes. Hi. - Is this your boat? - Yes. - Where's everybody? - Where's the harbourmaster? He's ill. Haven't you heard about it? It was an accident here. An aircraft... With bacteriological weapons that have spread stuff all over the peninsula. Why do you paint yourselves. What happened? It gives you an eruption. A lot of people here got eruptions. - What sort of eruption? - Can't you see? What can you do about it? There's nothing for it. We have ointment. It doesn't help. There is no treatment for it. Nothing can be done. No Claus! We have to get away from here! Don't! We're fully guarded here. We need to talk it through. Come on back. It's swarming with patrol boats. Might I have some whiskey? How did you get through? How did you get here? We went into Hamnnas No, it was Lerhamn Then we followed the coast. It wasn't hard at all. - No patrol boats? - Not one. Then you can go through with a dinghy! With a rowingboat. Have to do it at night. If we only get some through, they have to see to the rest. We could get through with frogman outfits. We need to get them to react. It's going great, don't you think? How nice! Is this a party? Good Lord, wine and shrimp...! Can you toast the bread? Listen... I was talking with some guys on the dock. We'll get out of here tonight. God, that's great...! That sound okay? What? Getting out of here tonight. We have to make a go of it. I've got the eruption. You... Then we have to... Eva-Britt... We have to get away tonight. Lena... But... Rickard and I and Annika can. We need to get help. Yes, you go. Let's eat something. The bread...! I'll do some new ones. Have some shrimp. See you soon. We can get those over there! What is it? Something terrible has happened. Some people were washed ashore down there. Their boat had probably been hit. Annika... I have to... I have to find Annika. The situation in Moelle now seems to be calm. The flags are flying at half mast in Moelle... ...which normally would have been welcoming summer guests. Of course, there are rumours about what happened in the closed-off area. Here are the facts: Some deaths have occurred among the old and the weak. The barrier has worked perfectly. No shootings have been reported. There are no longer concerns felt in the neighbouring areas. Only a few have left the area or evacuated their children. The population in the disaster area has met the situation with remarkable calm. Where the hell did you get to? We won't be going out today. You might have left without me. No, you know the way. We don't. Elsebeth is gone. Disappeared. - We can wait. - But Claus... We wouldn't go without you. I have to find her somehow, because... Give me a little time. Then we'll go. Annika is still in the sea. Annika... Elsebeth...? Elsebeth! Annika! Annika! Who is it? Don't come closer! Lena, is that you? Annika! Stay there! Lena, I'm not dangerous. I'm not contagious. – Come on, Lena. – Annika! Yesterday we rowed out, me, Dad, Rickard and Uncle Svensson and some others. At night we rowed, and it happened that a big boat drove into us... ...and Daddy screamed "SWIM!". There's Kent-Arne! Where's Mummy? When we get moving... sit still and hold on! When we get out... Listen! When we get out, I'll swim ahead. You swim behind... And you take the raft. Okay? - Is that clearly understood? - Yes! Put the blanket around them. Kent-Arne! Kent-Arne! Kent-Arne! We need to have more children. How the hell could you let go of the raft?! He was forced to. How the hell could you let go of the raft?! I'm sorry, it just happened. Lena! Lena! Annik... Annika! Lena! Mummy! Where are we going? I'm cold. We'll go home and warm up. Mummy... Subtitles by FatPlank for KG.
