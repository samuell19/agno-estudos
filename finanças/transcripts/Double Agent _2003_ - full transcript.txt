Han suk-kyu goh so-young double agent Workers' party anniversary at Kim ll-sung square April 25, 1979 Produced by koo bon-han Co-produced by han sun-kyu Executive producer park mu-seung cinematographer: Kim sung-bok lighting director: Shin hak-sung Edited by Kim sang-beum and Kim jae-beum Music director Michael staudacher First assistant director choi Chang-won Original story by koo bon-han Screenplay by shim hyae-won Producer park min-hee Directed by Kim hyun-jung June 1980, checkpoint Charlie, east Berlin Open the gate! I have to catch him! Not without a permit. He's a north Korean criminal! I'm a south Korean agent. Nice to meet you. I'm lim byung-ho. Congratulations on your defection to land of freedom. First, I'll take you to the nearest hospital. One week later, interrogation room 102 at kcia Lim byung-ho! Sleepy? You better not sleep, you bastard! Get up, you commie! Hey commie, talk. Out of breath? I could easily kill you, you know. So hurry and talk. Why did you defect? Hey asshole, you should have a reason for coming down! What? Freedom. I wanted freedom. Freedom? What freedom? There's none of that here, too. You worked for north Korean intelligence, and you don't even know that? Hey, breathe. Want a taste of electricity? Long live freedom. Long live freedom. Idiot. As a n.K. Agent in east Berlin, he was in charge of collecting eastern Europe intelligence. 19 of the 23 top secret files he brought over were confirmed accurate. That is all. Let's put him on a leash, and use him. Chief im. I understand, sir. Why did you defect? If I answer, will you let me live? It all depends on how you answer. I came because I wanted to see actress jung yoon-hee. Today, I will introduce a very special person. Far from the north, he struggled his way here for freedom. For a brief introduction, he was born in nampo city in 1952. After graduating from the people's school in moranbong, he joined the people's army, and became a top elite in the administration. Now, for escaping North Korea's totalitarian regime, let's give a big applause to lim byung-ho for coming to the land of the free. Let's hear what Mr. lim has to say. Long live the land of the free! Long live! Long live! My name is lim byung-ho, and I came for freedom! I came because I was very, very hungry! My south Korean comrades, I'm very grateful for this warm reception! Long live the land of the free! Freedom! Freedom! Long live the president! Long live the south Koreans! Long live the land of the free! Long live free democracy! Long live the land of the free! Freedom! You were great at that reception earlier. Why'd you use your northern dialect? Because I thought I needed to stir up the people's spirits. Is that what you were taught? Yes, sir. I was taught psychological warfare. Psychological warfare... Don't think that you can easily deceive people. If you came here to live, I can help you. If not, I'll shoot you to death. 1982 Christmas Eve, spy training camp in kangwon province Attention! Remember this sound. A 7.62 caliber Chinese rifle makes a unique firing sound, so if you feel that you're within the gun's range, take cover immediately. As far as 250 meters away, northern soldiers are trained to shoot the enemy's head. Before more soldiers arrive, finish your mission swiftly, and never leave anyone behind. That is all. That was "Rudolph the red nose reindeer." This is our first Christmas Eve without the year-round curfew. When the curfew was temporarily lifted on Christmas Eve in the past, many people crowded the downtown streets. The day once a year when people could stay up all night will now be a memory of the past. But maybe because of the white snow that falls on us, the faces you see on the streets will look happier than on other Christmas days. If there are people out there who'll spend a lonely Christmas, while watching the snow fall, how about thinking about someone who might also be thinking of you. Before I go, I'd like to play this last song for these people. Bringing you classical music, this is yoon soo-mi. How long have you worn that uniform? Almost two years, sir. I was getting used to seeing you in that uniform, but I guess I won't anymore. Pardon? Starting January 4, you'll be in charge of analyzing north Korean intelligence. So rather than being just a trainer of spies of North Korea, you're now an official agent. Congratulations. Two months later, national security & planning office Agent lim. Why is the army moving around? For the workers' party's anniversary. The main army is being sent to participate in the ceremony. When it's over, things will return to normal. I was worried we'd suddenly have work on our hands. How was it at yangpyong district? Any troublemakers there? Since everyone is 'naknak', they're listening well. 'Naknak'? - It means they're tamed. - I see. You must be having fun after agent lim arrived. What are you gonna do with a north Korean dictionary? Just wait and see. When we reunify after Kim ll-sung dies, we'll need it then. Don't you think? It's from the intelligence bureau. Let's go, agent lim. Agent Kim, I brought him over. Oh yeah? Come to think of it, he's the first north Korean to come in here. Anything checked out must be logged, but prohibited to leave. And keep in mind that it's your duty to maintain security. Stop being so uptight. Sir, what's in there? It's top secret stuff, so it doesn't relate to you. North Korean intelligence is over there. I'm late, but you shouldn't have done it all by yourself. It's no big deal. Shall I pick a few good ones for you? Before things change here, we should take some to remember. How's this? It's a unique one that arrived today and it has a fun message. Nice picture, huh? Is it Alaska? It is unique, but it gives off a weird feeling. Oh yeah, I heard you turned down doing the new program. But I thought you wanted to do it. I don't know. I wanted to catch up on things. And meet friends I haven't seen for a while. How about this for later? It would be nice to hear something new for a change. So what does Mr. baek talk about over drinks? Why? Just that I heard he was feared ever since he was in the army. I feel nervous just looking at him. Agent lim. Yes, sir. Subordinates get off earlier than their superiors. What a great company. Sang-wook, we'll go in my car so you can go home. But sir, I'll need approval if agent lim doesn't go with me. It's okay, just go home and rest. Okay, then good night, sir. Good night. I bet he's bothersome. No, I don't mind him at all. Let's go. I know I told you this before, but you should get settled down. She seems nice, so why don't you meet her? Sir, you can't make me go to church because of a woman. So why do you think people go to church? I'm not sure. The main reason why is that the church has a system that people want to live by. But they are selfish to those who live outside the system. So it's also the reason why you need to settle down. Out of the 555 confined political activists, 250 of them were released today. Since they've been released, it seems we'll be very busy. I have something regretful to announce. Our classical music program will be cancelled. Kim eun-sook's 'music scent' program will start next week. I'd like to thank our listeners for tuning in to our show. Here is the last song of our program. I have a postcard here from Mr. jang sang-soon, who hasn't sent one for a long time. Mr. jang, are you listening? Thank you for the postcard. His request is Mozart's 25th symphony g minor, number 183. I'll bring you this song, and say good-bye. This is yoon soo-mi for classical music. Make first contact. In January of 1981, 26 criminals were selected from samchung prison and underwent training for two and a half years. After fulfilling all espionage and infiltration training, they've been transformed into the perfect spies. This is a display of how they'd face any attack. Now let's proceed to the next demonstration. Sir, how is your dictionary coming along? Great. Thanks to your notes last time, it's running smoothly. Sir. Can we stop by the radio station on our way back? There's an album that I've been looking all over for. Really? You should've told me so. It worked out. I have a friend who works there. You should've asked me before. What did you say you needed? Shall I call the person in charge? No, that'll be fine. I'll slowly look for it myself. Okay, then have a look around. - Let's go have some coffee. - Sounds great. Yes, I'd like to speak to yoon soo-mi. The workers' party and people praise your heroic achievements. You've arrived faster than I thought. Pleased to meet you comrade. You'll receive instructions through me from now on. I will follow the orders of the great Kim ill-sung, and devote all my efforts to revolutionize the south. A kcia agent will arrive soon. We have to change the way we meet. You know baek seung-chul, right? It's been hard to keep in touch. Agent lim, did you find it? Yes, I'm done. How do you do? I'm glad you're here. I thought you'd never come. It'll be awkward at first, but you'll get used to it fast. Oh right, I have someone I'd like for you to meet. One moment. So what changed your mind to come? I was thinking about coming all along. Now I finally have the chance to introduce you two. This is lim byung-ho, the one I mentioned. And this is yoon soo-mi. Hello, I'm yoon soo-mi. Hello. How come the weekdays go by so slow, and the weekends fly by like this? Will you be going to church again tomorrow? Why? It's nothing. Just that I didn't expect for you to go so often. How old are you sang-wook? Me? I'm twenty-six. You're the same age as my younger brother. Then think of me as your younger brother. Agent lim... Please stop it. Take this. Don't run away! Easter charity eair Can I have some more? Please take some from soo-mi. It looks delicious. Here you go. Isn't it inconvenient using matches? I bought it at the charity, and I'd like for you to have it. Please take it. But why are you giving this to me? Hearing you talk about north Korean food reminded me of my father. I can't even remember his face now. But I only remember that he used this type of lighter. Sometimes comrade blue river tells me news about him. Have you ever gone to the north? I was born and raised here. Is it strange? Not at all. My father would risk his life for the workers' party. What is your father's name? His name is shim jong-kil; He works in state affairs. Have you heard of him? No, I've never heard of him. It's very late. Have a safe trip home. I'll see you again next week. 16 of our spies disguised as fishermen will depart from samchuk port at 1:00am on may 23, and approximately at 3:00am, they will naturally enter north Korean waters. Within three hours, if the north's patrol boats seize it, they will arrive at wonsan port at approximately 9:00am. As usual, they will be deported through panmunjom within two months. Six of them will remain disguised as defectors. Please, you don't have to. Just take the medicine. But you were so generous before. Thank you. Please don't, it looks like an expensive handkerchief. It's alright. What's this? It's your favorite. But you shouldn't have. Good-bye. Give her the medicine regularly. Yes, thank you. Okay, okay. Let's go. He did well. May 27, 1982, 1:00am, samchuk port, kangwon province It's been four hours since they went up, but why is it so quiet? Let's wait until the new satellite photo comes in. Let me see it again. If it goes as planned, the north's patrol boats should've spotted them within a 100-mile radius an hour ago. But so much time has passed. Agent lim. Could the north have done something unexpected? I'm not too sure. Either they captured our boat faster than expected, or it's hard for our men to communicate with us. Agent lim. The 16 spies to North Korea drowned to death. How is it? Why is it so bland? Isn't she stingy on the salt? You're supposed to eat that fish dish without salt. It's your loss if you didn't know. I heard the flatfish dish tastes good here. Can you wrap some up for us? Agent lim, do you like baseball? I'm not too sure. This is my first time seeing baseball. You're missing out on a lot. Look at the ball and swing. Have you batted before? No, it's my first time. Have you ever felt alone or scared? Never mind. You're not supposed to feel those things. Do you remember what you said on your Christmas program? Pardon? Never mind. Please go inside. Don't worry about following up on the job. Everything will be taken care of. Goodnight. You were batting well for your first time. Could it be because soo-mi was watching? Next time, let's take soo-mi to jamshil stadium. Okay, let's do it. Oh yeah, Mr. hwang wanted me to buy some chicken. I completely forgot. I'll go buy some, so please wait a sec. Sure. I'm always the errand boy. Do you prefer Russian? Maybe it would be better... I'm an international reporter, my name is Sean Howard. It smells great. Mr. hwang better pay me back for this. I'm sick of cleaning up after him. Doesn't seem like his daughter. What a lucky old man. June 2, 1983, near daechung reservoir north Korean spies' refuge, location 143 Gentlemen! It's raining, so why don't you eat and stay at our place? We're going before it rains harder. But if you have pretty girls, maybe we won't, right? Will it be okay? Don't worry. There you are. It's raining and it's late, so I came to ask if you wanted to stay at our place. That's okay. We're about to leave. If you change your mind, then please tell me. Why is it raining so hard? Let's hurry. What's wrong? The bicycle is gone. You go on ahead without me. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, don't wait for me and go. I want to go with you. No, there's something for you to do. If I don't return by then, you have to take care of what's inside here. Emotions can kill a person more easily than a gun. Having no emotions will protect you. Be careful on your way down. Hello? Hello? Agent lim. Agent lim. Yes. The chief wants you in the interrogation room. Know who's the number 58th man in the workers' party? Ki hyung-chul. Have you seen him in the north? No, he was never at any official meeting. Of course he wasn't, since he wasn't in the north. Ki hyung-chul. Ranked 58th in the workers' party. Spy leader of the south. Code name blue river. For twenty-six years, you lived by the name of song gyung-man. After deciphering a code, we discovered a new fact. And there was information on our northern spies. But we thought the north's patrol boats had made a mistake. Was the person found who leaked the information? They think it leaked from the Navy. So we can feel relieved. But the details seem unclear. If you interrogate these types of scum, they'll be as stubborn as a martyr. I thought it would help if you question him. Since you know about north Korean conditions. Comrade blue river, I came from the secret training center. As you know, we get harsh training there. So that's why I have a bad temper. Our recent spy mission was top secret and known by only a very few people. We want to know who handed over this information. I don't speak to scum who betray the north. What made me a scum is the Democratic people's Republic of North Korea. I'll ask you again. Who gave you the information? When I was a child, I went with him to the park. I begged a photographer to take my picture with him. Then he consoled me and said, "a picture can't capture the sky and this whole park since it's small, so it's useless.” I didn't know then. About why he didn't want his picture taken. Byung-ho, you did what you had to do. I'm sure he understands. Byung-ho. He's okay, right? He'll be okay, right? Shit, he hit his damn head on a nail. With six holes in his head, he went to the hospital. Those damn commies have to show that they're tough. Thank you everyone. I've been appointed as the new chief of intelligence. Yesterday, I was updated on blue river's condition. Currently, he's still unconscious. The doctor believes his chances of recovering are slim. So some may think capturing the spy network is difficult, but I think differently. I'm sure about one thing. After blue river's capture, I won't just stop here. In order for leftist pro-communists and overseas radicals to never set foot here, I will root out the sources of evil. It's ki-young; I just arrived. How's mom? Yes, I'll be home soon. Kim ki-young! Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? So how's your work going? I'm working as hard as I can, sir. That Kim ki-young we just brought in. The one who committed treason? I may have mentioned this, but wouldn't it be a waste if blue river died? Pardon? Sir, everything is ready. Okay. Anyway, we can link blue river to Kim ki-young. Handle him well. Yes, sir. I think there's a misunderstanding. I'm only an average student studying abroad. So you participated in a student movement. Is there some problem with that? And you went to study in Germany in November 1980. Yes. The next year you went to east Berlin, right? I went with my west Berlin friends only out of curiosity. Don't worry too much. But since you visited an enemy-state, you'll be educated about security for a few days. I was in east Berlin as well. Did you happen to go to the north Korean embassy there? No. On four dordea street. Past the guard post, a gravel road leads to the front door. I worked there. Ever seen a workers' party certification? Here's both the certificate and the party application form. Party converters receive two to three years of training, and are sent to the south to become spies. One, two... I'm sorry about last time. There's still no word from the hospital. Anyway, were there any orders from above? I think they want us to wait it out. Luckily, the agency is focusing on Kim ki-young instead. So don't worry too much. Things have settled down. Please don't talk about it anymore. Wow, what a beautiful couple. How about a picture? No thank you. Come on, just one. No, we're fine. Excuse me! Move this way a bit. Here it goes. One, two... I'm sorry. Mr. go, all you need to do is follow my orders. It's important, so do your best. All I will do is follow your orders, sir. Agent lim is here, sir. Tell him to come in. Agent lim, you remember go choon-mo, right? It's been a long time. How have you been? Fine, thanks to you. I'll be leaving now, sir. Sit. So how's it going with that student? I've pretty much covered the basics. But I've yet to... Then you've done enough. Good work. Gu choon-mo will handle the rest, so just get the paperwork ready after the deposition. By the way, my wife wants you to come over for dinner this week. Is soo-mi free, too? Yes, I think she's free. It finally looks like a garden after three years. I started it when I met you at the agency. We've known each other for a quite a while now. I remember what you first told me at namsan tower. You said if I came to live, you'd help, but if not, you'd kill me. If you hadn't looked useful, then I wouldn't have said that. But lately when I look at you, sometimes I don't understand why you came. Are you happy being here? Sir, have you ever seen a batting range? You mean where you bat the ball shooting out of a machine? Sounds peculiar for someone who grew up without baseball. Sounds good, huh? Frankly, about that tree out in front... I should've invited you sooner. I hope you liked the food. Yes, it was delicious. Let's have some fruit. Soo-mi, please have some. When we were kids, we fell in there often. It's from work. Excuse me. The fruit is very sweet. What a relief. Sure that car is the one? I understand. If anything else comes up, report to me immediately. They found blue river's car. Honey, bring some rice nectar. - Please, don't. - That's okay. Our rice nectar is the best. Soo-mi, do you like rice nectar? Yes. The embassy is on four dordea street. The bus takes you there in 10 minutes from the station. Also, there's a guard post at the front gate. If you pass the gate, there's a gravel road. You can follow that road to the office. Now you're doing well after lying before. So why'd you go there? To become a commie, right? No, sir. Seen this application before? There had to be someone who showed you this. You met some spy and signed this, didn't you? Please save me. Please save me. I can't stand the weather here, especially summer. I don't mind the heat, but it's the stench I hate. I saw a prayer room downstairs. South Korean cigarettes aren't so bad. I'll give you exactly a week. It'll be enough time to clean things up. It'll be good not to think too much. It'll take your courage away. And regarding that traitor, this is a good chance to prove your innocence. Comrade. Haven't heard from your family in a while, right? Soo-mi, let's go to your place. Was there any news from above? I haven't been contacted yet. Then why does the party think I'm a traitor? Is it because you didn't give me these instructions? What happened? Tell Mel after stealing the intelligence, eliminating blue river was your last assignment. So why didn't you tell me? Don't you get it? That order means that their getting rid of us. And if you had carried it out, you'd obviously die. Who told you to interpret the order? I risked my life to revolutionize the south. So who are you to screw things up? I didn't want you to die. Sure. You chose to come down here. But I had no choice from the beginning. After my father left for the north, I had to change my name and live like someone else. Then one day my father sent a letter. "So0-mi, I'm so proud of you." That was the last I heard from him. I found out later that he was executed, but I was scared of the party, so I pretended not to know. But when I'm with you, I feel fortunate to be alive. You know you didn't take the photo just out of pity for me. Can't we just go somewhere? A place without the north and south. Stop your rebellious talk. If they want me to die, then I will. Agent lim. You've done a good job until now. Since his deposition is over, we can catch the rest of them. You can just get the paperwork ready for the court depositions. But what about the tape recording? Don't worry about it. You can just organize what's been written here. Your name's lim byung-ho, right? I'm glad I didn't get it wrong. What do you mean by that? It's nothing much. They just asked for your name. Get up! How may I help you? I just needed a reference for that student's deposition. Do you have tapes on that revolutionary party case? Revolutionary party? It'll take some time. Do you need all the tapes? Yes, if that's possible. Okay. So why did you convert your classmates to your side? On last may 31, I was trained at the north Korean embassy in east Berlin and returned on June 6. After persuading my fellow classmates, Lee dong-min, jung gyung-ho, and kwan sae-joon, I linked them to spy leaders, song gyung-man and lim byung-ho, and made them into espionage agents. This is all that I have now. What are you listening to? Agent lim. Agent lim. It must by hard staying at your assigned quarters. Your restrictions will be lifted, so be a bit more patient. Then I'll take you wherever you want. With three years of experience, I know all the streets. If you just tell me where... Sang-wook, stop. Please. I think I ate too much for dinner. I'll go walk around for a bit. Okay. I know it's too late for me, but I have something to say. The party needs you, so if you return quickly... How long were you waiting there? I'd like for you to meet someone. So00-mi, have you ever believed in hope? Miss. Does this look like her or does this one? Try remembering harder. If you get it right, a 15 million won reward is yours. Well... I'm not sure, since I only saw her briefly. Was there anything they exchanged with each other? I do remember her bringing in something. But it wasn't out of the ordinary. I think it was some bakery bag. My child cried so much that day. Miss, what did you just say? I'm at a point where I can't turn back. I may have only one more day left to live. But with the choice that I made, I know that I could spend the rest of my time in regret. But at this moment, I'm hoping that I can live differently from the past. Yes, is this koryo bakery? Where are you located? The bag was found in a sack in blue river's basement. Yes, thank you. I got the location. It's across the jungdong radio station. Radio station? Sir, we're taking the suspect's picture to koryo bakery now. Have any other orders, sir? Take this also. And report to me only when you find something. I understand, sir. Find out where agent lim is now. That damn defense ministry in your workers' party is expanding by three bureaus. I should've helped you sooner, but I'm sorry I was busy. You don't know how hard it was without you. Agent lim. Yes, sir. So there you are. Let's have lunch. I need to talk to you. Yes, sir. But you seem to be tied up. No, it's not urgent, sir. Is it okay, sir? Of course, go ahead. Have a good lunch, sir. Let's go. Has something bad happened to soo-mi? Sir? Just that she looked so pale when she came over last time. It's nothing serious. She just has a cold. So you had something to tell me, sir? I got a call from the military hospital. They said that blue river died this morning. If he had been alive, we could've gotten more out of him. But even so, he never would've talked. You may be right. But from my own experience, most commies always gave in. While being an officer at the dmz, I admired the north Korean guards there. They looked more like real soldiers compared to ours. But after interrogating some who had defected, that thought completely disappeared. They were selfish filth who sacrificed their families. So lately I've been thinking that we have to keep a closer eye on people like them. Thank you. Can I have some water? Oh my goodness. I'm sorry. How clumsy of me. I'm very sorry. Sir, I'll go clean up in the restroom. I'll clean it up quickly. Is everything fine? Need some help? Then can you hold this for me? Sir, they wanted to report to you in person, so I gave them the number here. Hello? Sir, I'm at the radio station. The bakery owner said it was her in the photo. She said she bought items there often. Sang-wook. Sang-wook. Agent lim, have you finished lunch? No, I have to go back in. Anyway, why'd you want me to park here? Sang-wook, I've got a favor to ask. What is it? I have to pick up some stuff at Kim ki-young's place, but I can't leave the table. You'll have to go for me. Sure, where is it? Paju geumchon apartments... I can get off geumchon station after taking highway one. I got it. We made plans to go to the baseball stadium, but we never had the chance. That's okay, we'll go next time. Sang-wook, thanks for everything. What's wrong with you all of a sudden? It's my job. All I need to do is pick up what's here? Yeah, thanks a lot. I'll be back soon. Three days ago, an agent saw him in the surveillance room. According to him, lim byung-ho was examining all the major checkpoints. Okay, I understand. Sir, a government car just went by nokbun checkpoint. I think it's Lee sang-wook's car. Block off all roads out of Southern Seoul. And tell all forces to dispatch to imjin river. Yes, sir. Tell them to arm themselves, and arrest him immediately. Yes, sir. - Agent lim. - Yes, sir. I'm locking up soon, so quickly find what you need. Hey, have you heard? Agent lim is a spy. What a sneak. Lim byung-ho! Mr. park. A bullet from a 22-caliber doesn't Pierce the skull. It sticks inside the brain and you slowly die in pain. Passengers, in 15 minutes we will land at Rio de Janeiro international airport. Thank you for flying with us. We hope you had a pleasant trip. Thank you very much. Have a good night. This is an inspection. Please show me your ID. My government badge... Where did it go? Sir, we've caught Lee sang-wook's car. But lim byung-ho has been moving separately by himself. Turn it off. A letter came in yesterday. Is something wrong? It's nothing. I thought about resting for a while. Come to think of it, we've never traveled. Something must really be wrong. Can you give me a glass of water? "Sometime in the future, My hair enclosed in this letter, please throw it on any street in the north. By this day, the name lim byung-ho will be forgotten." Two years later, Rio de Janeiro, Marica harbor Hello? What are you doing? I'm making dinner. When will you be home? Let's eat out today. I'm almost done, so come eat at home. No, let's eat out together. Will it be okay? It's fine. Let's go out tonight. Okay. I'll be home soon. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! My car broke down, so could you help me? Do you know how to change a fan belt? Thank you. I had a very important date. You're a life-saver, thanks. Now I can meet my girlfriend. Thank you very much. Your welcome. Wait! Please wait! I don't know how to thank you. Please take this. No thanks. Just think of it as a small token of my gratitude. Thanks again. Thank you. Thank you. Lim byung-ho.
