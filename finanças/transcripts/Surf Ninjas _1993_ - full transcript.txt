RULED BY ONE LINE OF WARRIOR KINGS, WAS THE MOST PEACEFUL PLACE ON EARTH. THEN ONE DAY, THE PEOPLE GATHERED TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF CROWN PRINCE AD-HAM... OF WHOM THE PROPHECIES FORETOLD WOULD BECOME A TRUE VISIONARY. AND HIS BROTHER, CROWN PRINCE YOW-NI, WOULD BE EVEN A GREATER WARRIOR KING THAN HIS FATHER. IT WAS FORETOLD IN THE SEVENTH CYCLE, AFTER MEN FLEW AS EAGLES TO THE MOON-- Adam: WHOA, BABE. YOU JUST LOST ME. THE PEACE WOULD BE BROKEN BY BLOODSHED. AAH! AAH! AAH!

MAC WAS A FORMER AMERICAN SAILOR. OY. AHH! [GUNSHOTS] AAH! [GUNSHOTS] AAH! [CRYING] [CRYING] MAC HAD WORKED FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS. HIS LOYALTY TO THEM WAS BEYOND REPROACH. IT WAS INTO HIS ARMS THAT I ENTRUSTED THE 2 CHILDREN. YOU WERE THOSE CHILDREN, YOUR HIGHNESSES. FOR COLONEL CHI, YOU ARE THE LIVING THREAT TO HIS RULE. TO ME, YOU ARE THE LIVING PROPHECY WHO WILL FREE OUR COUNTRY. DON'T YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TO DO THAT? MAN, I REALLY WANT TO DRIVE. LISTEN, WE DON'T WANT TO FREE ANYTHING, TONTO. WE WANT OUR DAD BACK. THAT'S ALL. MAC IS INCONSEQUENTIAL. THE REBELLION IS WHAT COUNTS NOW. YOU MUST RETURN WITH ME TO PATUSAN. HEY! OUR DAD IS NOT INCONSEQUENTIAL. YOU, YOUR PROPHECY... YOUR REBELLION...

WE SHALL EITHER BE VICTORIOUS OR IN OUR GRAVES. THERE'S NO GRAY AREA WITH YOU, IS THERE? I MEAN, THE GLASS IS EITHER HALF-FULL, OR WE'RE DEAD. COME ON! NOW STAY TOGETHER ON THE TRAIL. WATCH OUT FOR LARGE RED ANTS, LIZARDS WITH SHARP TEETH, AND BLACK PYTHONS, WHICH CAN SUFFOCATE A MAN IN ONE SQUEEZE. THANKS. ♪ THIS IS THE DANGEROUS WORLD WE CHOOSE... ♪ JUST BEYOND THAT RIDGE IS THE VILLAGE OF MEE GROB. WHILE IN PATUSAN, GUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION STAY AT THE MEE GROB HILTON. THAT'S THE MEE GROB HILTON, SERVING STRANGE THINGS IN SHELLS SINCE 1207. IT'S THE BIRTHPLACE OF A GREAT HOPE. WOW. THEN I GOT TO GET A T-SHIRT. I CAN SEE THE MORNING COOKING FIRES. THERE WILL BE MANY SUPPORTERS. THEN WE'LL GO TO THE CAVES OF KWANTZU, THE CAVES OF THE ANCIENTS. WHAT'S THERE? YOUR INHERITANCE. MONEY? NO... SOMETHING NOT EVEN MONEY CAN BUY-- THE KNIVES OF KWANTZU. KNIVES? OH, YEAH. SERIOUSLY, THAT'S SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY--KNIVES. ONCE I WENT TO A CUTLERY STORE AND SAID, "HERE'S $100,000. CAN I BUY A KNIFE?" THEY SAID, "NO. MONEY CAN'T BUY KNIVES." GEE, I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU HARDLY EVER SEE ANY OF THEM AROUND. ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE EXPEDITION, THEY CAME ACROSS A GIANT RUBBER PLANT. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY COULD NOT CUT IT DOWN. FOR, AS WE KNOW, MONEY CAN'T BUY KNIVES. WALKING AROUND THE PLANT, THEY CONTINUED ON THE SHORES OF PATUSAN. IS THERE NO WAY WE CAN SHUT THIS CHATTERING MONKEY UP? YOU KNOW, I'D CUT HIM, BUT I DON'T HAVE A KNIFE. WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS? I'LL GIVE YOU 3 GUESSES. BUT WHY DID THEY SPARE THAT OLD MAN AND THOSE FEW OTHERS? SO THERE WOULD BE SOMEONE LEFT ALIVE TO TELL. TELL WHAT? TO WHO? TO ANYONE WHO'D HELP US. THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM. WE'RE NEAR KWANTZU, BUT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE IS HIDDEN. OH, THAT'S GOOD. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND IT? IT'S NOT MY DESTINY TO FIND IT. OF COURSE NOT. I AM THE KING. OK. WHAT IF I FIND IT? Adam: MAYBE DOWN HERE. HEY! COME BACK HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT? I'M TALKING TO YOU. FREEZE RIGHT THERE. WHOA! COOL! YOU KNOW, BOY, DON'T YOU? WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT? [RUMBLING] AAH! JOHNNY! ARE YOU OK? YEAH. HEY, I FOUND WALDO! REALLY? PSYCH! SERIOUSLY, 3 YEARS AGO, MY COUSIN WENT IN A CAVE, NEVER CAME OUT. THEY NEVER FOUND HIM. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. THEY THINK MAYBE HIS BODY WAS EATEN BY BATS. Spence: IF YOU KEEP ON TELLING THEM CAVE STORIES, THEN YOU AND YOUR COUSIN WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THINGS IN COMMON. THE WEAPONS OF KWANTZU. JUST AS THE PROPHECIES FORETOLD, THESE WEAPONS WILL BE YOURS, YOUR HIGHNESS. 4,000 YEARS... OF WARRIOR BLOOD, SPIRIT, AND ENERGY ARE HELD IN THESE WEAPONS. THAT SPIRIT NOW... WILL ENTER YOU. STAND AND DEFEND YOURSELF! NOT YOU, HIM! DEFEND MYSELF? LISTEN-- KWANTZU! HAH! YAH! LISTEN, WHAT IS IT WITH YOU? YOU KNOW--AAH! LISTEN! HOLD ON! LISTEN! HOLD ON! HOLD ON! HOLD ON! COULD WE JUST STOP THIS? YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A REALLY BAD AURA ABOUT YOU. AAH! I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED, BUT EVERYWHERE WE GO, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT... AND THAT MEANS YOU GOT A PROBLEM, AND I THINK IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF A DEEP-SEATED EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. AAH! HYAH! HYAH! THE WARRIOR SPIRIT'S WITHIN YOU. HYAH! LISTEN, I DON'T WANT ANY SPIRITS IN ME! I DON'T WANT ANY SPEARS IN ME! I DON'T WANT ANYTHING IN ME! YOU MANIAC! HYAH! HUH! YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU. LISTEN, SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT, IF YOU SWING THAT THING AT ME ONE MORE TIME, I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR BUTT! AAH! OK. OK. OK-- [CHOIR SINGING BEETHOVEN'S ODE TO JOY] OK! HYAH! NEVER MESS WITH ZORRO. WOW! JOHNNY'S AMAZING. I KNOW. HE CAN GET A JOB AS A SUSHI CHEF, NO PROBLEM. [EXPLOSION] WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A CHAIN GANG. WHAT DO WE DO? WE HAVE TO GO AROUND THEM. IF WE'RE PICKED UP BY ONE OF THE PATROLS, WE'LL END UP PRISONERS OURSELVES. WHOA! THIS TRAIL IS MASSIVELY NARROW. WHAT IF SOMEBODY FELL? WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! OOF! AAH! ADAM! WHAT HAVE I SAID?
