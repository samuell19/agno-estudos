God. - You feeling okay, baby? - What's that supposed to mean? I mean, you were pretty drunk last night. I'm fucking fine, Chip. Except for the fact that rent's due. That means I got to go see the fat fuck today. What's your problem? You look like someone shit in your cereal. What's wrong? I don't know. I just hate thinking about you being with Ken. Yeah, well, imagine having to actually do it. How else we're gonna make any money? - I work. - Fucking hell. Come on. Come on, it's not a big deal, alright? It's not a big deal. He's just a sugar daddy with a itty-bitty wiener and a big old bank account. The opposite of me. Is that what you're saying? Well, you can always grow your bank account. Stop that. Stop that. Forget about me and Ken, okay? Don't mean shit. Okay. Oh, my God. Does that hurt? Yeah. - I was a bad girl last night, wasn't I? - Yeah, you were a bad girl. What did I... what did I do? Did I do this? - That is how I got that. - Yeah. You know what I thought I did? I thought I also... ...did... this. Yeah? I did all kinds of terrible things? Terrible, terrible things because I'm a... ...I'm a bad fucking girl. Shit. Hey, babe, we got anything to eat? I don't know, Chip, did you go to the grocery this week? No. Well, then I guess that answers your question. - Hey, Clint, come on in. - Chip, you about ready? Is it 9:00 already? I'm just gonna grab a shirt. Be back. Okay. Okay. I got to go, baby. See you later. - Hey, Liza, you looking fine. - Yeah, Clint, I know. - Alright, let's go. - Alright. - Wait, hold on, let me grab my wallet. - Come on, Chip. - What, you ain't gonna lock up? - Nothing in there worth taking, Clint. - Besides Liza's got the keys. - You're a kept man, Chip. - You blame me? Look at her. - I already did. I got a better look when she used to work at the Crafty Beaver. Well, she doesn't work there anymore. Problems with management. - That's typical. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, one time my buddy got a lap dance from her... ...and she pulled a knife on him because he didn't tip enough. He said she damn near slashed his throat. - How long ya'll been dating? - Coming up on six months. - No shit. - Yes. No, I heard she was dating that Dane Erickson back in January. Well, I guess that ain't true? Seeing how she was with you and everything. With milk like that, no need to buy the cow. You know what I'm saying? You wouldn't know by looking at her, but my Heather... ...used to be a hell of a piece of tail until the pregnancies wrecked her body... - ...and then her face followed after that... - Turn the pump, Clint. You ain't got to worry about that with Liza. She don't strike me as the motherly type. She ain't about to be tamed, Chip. I bet you she does everything. Seems like the adventurous type. - Goddammit, what's the deal with you today? - What do you mean? I mean, you won't stop talking about my girlfriend. What are you trying to say? I made a lot of mistakes in my past... ...and each and every one of those mistakes can be blamed on one thing. - And you know what that is, boy? - What is that? That sweet pussy. It'll cloud a man's mind. It'll have him doing shit he ain't never dreamed of. Pussy used in the wrong way will fuck a man up. Pussy used in the right way ain't no better either. There would be less people in our prison systems if it wasn't for pussy. Then again... ...the great pyramids wouldn't exist if it wasn't for pussy. - It's a conundrum. - What the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about that girl of yours, son. Look, kid, I just don't want to see you get in a bad situation because of pussy. Jesus Christ, man, that's my girlfriend you're talking about. It's not some piece of pussy, okay? I love her. Okay. Okay. Okay. I didn't mean to get you all bent out of shape over this. Man, I got a lot of problems in life but my relationship with Liza isn't one of them. You really want to help me out, you know what to do. Thank you for the money. As for the advice, you can keep it. You know you're going to listen to me on the way home. - Liza? - Back here, baby. What the fuck? - Where did you get those, Liza? - I got them from Dwayne. Where did your psycho brother get guns from? I thought he was on parole. Well, who is it? What do you need guns for? Those aren't loaded, right? I will answer both of your questions... ...when I'm done with you. Now, take off your fucking clothes. - Liza, I'm... I'm... - I said take off your fucking clothes. Okay, lady, I will do whatever you want just don't shoot. Yes, you'll do whatever I want for the rest of your life. Get... in... here. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! - Oh, baby. I love you so much. - Oh, my God. Be quiet. Sorry. You're really something else, babe. Don't you forget it. God. So, seriously, what's the deal with the guns? We're gonna use them to solve all our problems, baby. - Tonight. - What do you mean? I went to see the fat fucker at his house today. Daddy, oh, my God. Daddy, oh, my God. Fuck! You are... one sweet piece of ass, girl. Worth every damn penny. Speaking of all that, rent's comin' up, Daddy. Of course it is, sugarplum. You let big daddy take care of you. I got something I wanna show you. I think you're gonna like it. - Feast your eyes on that. - Daddy, is that all for me? You're sweet. But you ain't that sweet. Sixty-eight big ones. Got a line on a slightly used Lambeau... ...canary yellow, of course. Pickin' it up on Monday. You be a good girl, I might let you take a ride with me. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Of course I would. But you got to get out of here. Madge will be back from the club soon. Go on, get. I'll call you when I need you. $68,000. It's enough to get us out of this shithole forever. You know what we're gonna do? Tonight, you and me... ...we're gonna sneak in there after they fall asleep... ...and we're gonna grab that money and be hundreds of miles away... - ...before they even realize it's gone. - We're just sneaking in. - Why do we need guns? - Well, in case. In case what? What, they wake up and we'll just shoot 'em? I was planning on never shooting anybody, Liza, like ever. Well, if, and it's a big if, it's ever gonna happen... ...but if we run into trouble we'll just, you know... - ...use them to make sure they cooperate. - I don't know. It's a lot to think about. It's not a lot to think about. Yes, it is. How is that not a lot to think about? I'm tired of living like this, Chip! I'm tired of living like this. You shovel shit for a living. I suck dick. And I'm sick of it. What do you want out of life, Chip? I just want to make you happy. Baby... ...I gotta be honest with you. I'm not happy. You know what'd make me happy? 68,000 fucking dollars. They're alone out there? They don't have any kids or anything? - No. - They have a dog? Ken's allergic. I'm not a burglar. You'd be the cutest burglar in the state if you were. - Stop. - Those dimples. I love 'em. Stop it. - How do we sneak in without waking them up? - Trust me. I've got a plan. Listen, I have a plan. We'll be in and out like nothing. I promise. - And nobody will get hurt, right? - That's right. Say it. In and out like it's nothing. Nobody gets hurt. And then you and me... ...we get to live happily... ...ever... ...after. I love you. I know you do, Chip. I know you do. Jesus, Chip, calm down. You're making me tense. - What the fuck are you doing? - Unloading this thing. It makes me nervous. - Don't be such a pussy. Put the bullets back. - I don't understand why we need bullets. If I can't rely on you to simply hold a loaded gun, how can I rely on you at all? Now, Chippy, can I rely on you? Yes, you can rely on me. Good. Reload the goddamn thing and hurry up about it because we're here. Liza, wait. - What now? - You forgot this. - Thanks. - They don't have an alarm, do they? No security, no kids, no dogs. We already went over this. Sorry, I forgot. Fuck! Were you standing at the back of the line when they were handing out brains? - I'm not stupid. - Baby, I know. I know. So stop acting like you are, okay? Come on. Crap! - Shit! - I told you to shut the fuck up. Lion scare the shit out of me. Did he kill that thing? No, the lion stuffed itself when it found out it had cancer. I thought he was some old dude. You never told me that he kills giant animals. You said they'd be asleep. I didn't know he was filming. I'd have made him pay more. We got to get out of here. Liza. What the fuck? What the fuck? Grab her! You little... - You motherfucker! - I can't breathe! I can't breathe! - Fuck! - Shit, this thing is hot. - Take your mask off, idiot. - What? Well, they're dead. They're not gonna see your face. - Fucking jerk. - Why did you fucking kill them? Why? Because he's a slimy piece of shit. And she married a slimy piece of shit. I don't know. Fucking, whatever. They're dead. What are you so upset about? I agreed to steal money, Liza! Not fucking kill people with knives. Jesus, relax, take a chill pill, okay? You act like you've never killed anyone before. Because I never have! Well, you'll get used to it. Trust me. Oh, God. Goddammit. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Come here, come here, come here. Come here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please. Please don't be mad at me. Come here. Come to me. You got to listen to me. I'm really amped up right now. You know how I get, you know how I get. Hey! Hey! We have to finish this job, okay? We have to. Now go get the money. Get your head in the game for me. Come on. Drop that shit, come on. Let's go. You lost your gun. You are a shitty little burglar. Put that right here. The safe is behind the painting. What the shit is that? Fucker thought he was James Bond or something. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, baby. Fuck, baby. We did it. Here it is. 68,000 fucking dollars, baby. We did it. Fuck. I thought you said no one else was here. No one's supposed to be. Go fucking check it out. Go. Hi. - No! Please let me go! - I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. No, no, no, slow, slow, slow. - Leave me alone. Get out of here. - No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait. Wait, wait, I'm not gonna hurt you. I swear to God I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. Tell me your name. I'm gonna move my hand. Tell me your name. - Violet. - Violet, listen to me. Here's what's gonna happen. I have to tie you up and put you in a closet... ...but I swear to God we're not gonna hurt you, okay? Like, hell, we aren't. Throw her ass in there. Fuck! Fucking pulled this off, baby. - Great, fucking great. - Can't you just be happy for one second? Happy? Are you crazy? Two people are dead because of us, Liza. Now we're kidnappers. Why'd we take her with us? - I got a plan for her. - Are you gonna tell me what that is? I am gonna tell you what that is but right now I want something from you. - What? What? - You fucking know. Get in! - Fuck me! - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Let me out! - Fuck! God! Shut the fuck up! Shut up in there. Shut the fuck up in there or I will shoot you through this trunk. - Do you hear me? - Okay, I understand. I'll be quiet. Alright, good. Get the fuck in the car. We're getting the fuck out of here. You poor thing. Had a rough night. Saw a lot of shit you probably weren't expecting to see. But don't you worry, little man. Pretty soon we'll be hightailing it out of this shithole... ...with our hard-earned money and maybe you can get that stick out of your ass. You know, you don't have to be such a bitch all the time. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. - Doesn't your brother live around here? - Yeah. - Is that where we're going? Why? - Yeah. Because she's cute. I'm pretty sure I can sell her to him. - You think you can sell her to Dwayne? - That's only exactly what I just said. Sorry, I just... what makes you so sure that Dwayne's gonna buy a girl from you? - He's bought girls from me before. - What the fuck? You've sold Dwayne girls before? Gave me three grand for the last girl and she was only a skanky little crack whore. I'm pretty sure I can get at least 5Gs for this one. So your brother's like a human trafficker or white slaver or some shit like that? Does my brother strike you as the kind of guy who can run a human trafficking operation? No, he strikes me as someone who's living off of disability checks in a shitty part of town... ...that never leaves his house because he's a complete fucking weirdo. That's not a very nice way to talk about my only living relative, Chip. Fuck, it's true. So, I guess I'll let it slide. So what does he do with the girls you bring him? You sit tight. You know how Dwayne is around other people. Best if I deal with this by myself. This is crazy. This is fucking crazy. Where the shit does a retard like Dwayne get three grand? I haven't seen three grand... Shit. Fuck! Oh, fuck, shit! She was hard to deal with. What the fuck are you doing here, Chip? Hey, Dwayne. Liza, what the hell? I've been waiting in the car for like half an hour. - How long is this gonna take? - You left her in the fucking trunk. Are you fucking stupid? What if she starts screaming again? God, you're such an idiot sometimes, I swear to God. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? Dwayne, pause this shit. I don't want to miss it. You look mad, Chippy. - Why do you treat me like this, Liza? - Like what? Like making fun of me all the time and belittling me. Because sometimes I have to, honey. Okay? Being with you is like having a small child instead of a boyfriend. Now, what I need you to do is go out there... ...bring the girl in here, that's it. Think you can manage? Oh, my God. I know. It's a trip, ain't it? Dwayne's really into his new hobby. Is this what Dwayne does with the girls you sell him? I've only sold him one, and that's her so, yeah, I guess so. And you're okay with that? What Dwayne does is his own business. Okay? That girl has to go either way and I could kill her myself or... ...you know, make a few extra bucks. I figured make a few extra bucks. There you go, loosening it up a little bit. I'm starting to think you turned into a total wuss. Are we done here? Alright. The fuck? Dwayne, I can hear it playing. I told you to pause that. Rewind that shit for me. The fuck's your problem? You look all tense, Chip? No, I'm just... I'm just super tired. Long day. I think, maybe we should... go. Fuck that. We're gonna hang out here for a while. Dwayne said that I can watch him perform with his exploratory surgeries... ...on the new girl. - Ain't that right, Dwayney? - Sure thing, sis. That sounds pretty cool. I should probably go grab the girl then. I'll get the girl. Do you have the keys? - I think I'll go with you. - You see, I got it. I can handle that. Just getting her out of the trunk. I got that. Got that on lockdown. I don't know about that. Let's just do this, cool. Let's go. We'll be right back. Whatever. Awfully quiet back there, Chip. What you thinking about? - Nothing. I'm not thinking about anything. - Really? Baby, you got the shittiest poker face in the world. You can't lie to me. - What the hell is bothering you? - It's just... It's just what, Chip? It's just... tonight's been a lot for me, Liza. I always knew you were crazy. It's one of the things I like about you but... ...I feel like tonight I'm seeing a side of you that I've never seen before. And I'm not gonna lie. It's... it's fucking scary. Wait a minute. Are you... are you breakin' up with me? - No, no. No, no, no, no. - You better fucking not. ...'cause I swear, I'll sell you to Dwayne, and I'll help him cut you into pieces... ...because every single thing that I have done tonight, everything... ...was so that you and I could have a better life. You know that! I know that! I know that. Let's just get this over with. I know that. Okay, shit. Fucking hell. Fucking shit. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. God! Jesus. If this is how you plan on breaking up with me you better finish the job. Stand aside, Liza. I don't want to have... Yo, motherfucker, what the fuck you doing with that girl? It's not what it looks like! It's not what it looks like! Get the fuck away from her before I... shit. What the fuck? I am impressed, baby. Really, I am. But you picked a piss poor time... ...and I do mean a piss poor time to grow some fucking balls. I guess now I'm gonna have to fucking kill you. Baby. - You gotta be fucking kidding me. - I'm gonna get you, Chip. - What the fuck! - Shit, shit, shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Yeah. Fuck! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Alright. Alright. What the fuck? Now what... Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Pull over, baby. Pull over! - I'm pulling... - Pull the fuck over! Fuck! Fucking hell. Hold me. I said fucking hold me. Hold me! That was the most fun I've had in ages. - You know what I mean? - I know what you mean, but it's just... ...it's kinda hard to feel the same way knowing that you want to kill me. - I don't want to kill you, you silly goose. - You said that you wanted to kill... That, no, like the heat of the moment kind of thing, you know? It's... You hit me upside the head, so, of course. - I also shot your brother. - Shit, yeah. He's pissed about that. Fuck him. He'll live, right? So, what you just forgive me like that? No. Fuck. Fuck. We got to kill her. Dump her body somewhere. - When I say we, I mean you. - I'll make it up to you some other way. - I swear to God. - Shut up. You're not getting out of this one. Okay? You will kill her... ...or I... will kill you. - Understand? - I understand. Okay, good. Honey, I'm so glad we're working this out. Well, fucking open your mouth. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Baby. - I don't feel so good, baby. - I'm sorry, but I gotta go. I'll send someone as soon as I can. Hey, I'm still in here. Shit. Violet, listen to me, I know that you're scared... ...but I really, really don't want to hurt you. I promise. - Some help here. - Sorry. - You can let go now. - Sorry. Careful. You okay? - On your knees. - Don't shoot me. - I said on your knees, Chip. - How do you know my name? The trunk isn't soundproof, dude. I heard everything. I mean, everything. Where's Liza? She's not here, okay? It's just me. Look, just calm down, okay? Calm down? You hit me in the head and stuffed me in your trunk. - No, I didn't. That was Liza. - And you murdered the McKenzies. - No, I didn't. That was her too. - And you just went along with it? No, I... yeah... yes. But I didn't know that she was... fuck! Your girlfriend sounds like a real piece of work, Chip. She's not my girlfriend anymore, okay? Not after all of this. Look, can we... can we please just talk about this? I can explain everything. Can I at least get up? My knees hurt. Alright, but do it slow and keep your hands where I can see them. Now, lift up your shirt. Turn around slowly. - See, I'm not armed. - I wasn't checking for weapons, Chip. - Who are you? - That's not the real question here, Chip. The question is... what now? Come on, Chip, I thought we were past that. What makes you think I won't? You're not a killer, Chip. Not even close. Crap, fucking shit! Fuck, shit. Fuck, shit. Fuck, shit. Fuck. Fucking shit! Fuck, shit. Fuck, crap. Fuck! It was supposed to be so fucking easy. "In and out. Nobody gets hurt." That's what she said. Crap! Fuck me! Fuck! And you know what? You're right. I'm not. I'm not a killer. Okay? So, what the shit am I supposed to do with you? - You could leave me here. - I can't do that. You... You... you've seen my face. You know what car... - ...you know my goddamn name. - I won't tell anyone. I promise. I wish I could believe you. I honest to God wish I could... You know what I really wish? I wish that I had a goddamn time machine. I would go back in time and make tonight never happen. 'Cause I am so fucking fucked. - And why? Just for some stupid money. - Money? What money? The $68,000 that we stole from the McKen... You thought we were just here to kill them? Alright. You can't kill me. And you won't leave me. - There's always another option. - Yeah, what option is that? So, Chip, where are we goin'? - We? - You're stuck with me now, Chip. You should've killed me when you had the chance. All I know is that we gotta put as many miles behind us as possible. - Can I see it? - See what? I've never seen that much money all at once before. Holy shit. Oh, my God. It's just... The smell, you know. There's nothing else like it. Holy shit. I love this song. I knew it. - Stop, seriously. Take it easy. - I was making it rain. Come on. - Well, don't. Stop making it rain. - Alright. Jesus. - Seriously, pick it up, Violet. - Okay, whatever, party pooper. I'm not trying to be a party pooper. It's just I went through way too much shit... ...for that money to let it just get thrown around like that. What if somebody sees it? Come on, Chip. Who's gonna to see it? Fuck! - What are we gonna do? Shit. - We're gonna pull over. We're gonna pull over. We can't pull over. He's gonna freaking arrest us. You're not gonna outrun him in this hunk of junk, okay? Just calm down and pull the car over. - Hi! How... - What did we do, Mr. Officer? License and registration, please. Oh, my God, okay. I will try and find it for you. Is it in here? Nope. I'm gonna check the back, slowly. Is it back here? Man! Fucking... Daggone it! I just... I don't know. I can't seem to find it anywhere, officer. Poo. Where are you two guys going to this late at night? Well, I found this guy at the bar and I was like... "...you need to take me home so I could avoid drinkin' and drivin'." Met at a bar? - You've been drinking tonight too, sir? - I wish. - Oh, my God! Officer, officer. Officer. - No. I... no. I've not been drinking. Excuse me, Chip. Okay, listen, listen. I'm a little buzzed right now, okay? But when I get a little buzzed around a handsome fella... ...I get a little frisky. So, I told him... ...if you get me home safe... ...I'd let you put it in my ass. Step out of the car, sir. Go ahead, baby, I'll be right here waiting for you. Come on, you can do it. You look a little nervous, son. - You got something to be nervous about? - No. No, not... - You sure? - Yeah. But should I be nervous? I hope not for your sake. You get too nervous, you won't be able to get it up. And that, my friend, would be a terrible thing. It ain't often you get a sweetie like that... ...offer up her pooper, no questions asked. Man, I've been trying to get that. You about to have one of the best nights of your goddamn life, boy. So get your mind right and get your head in the game. Go on before she change her mind. And tell her to get her taillights fixed. That's why I pulled you over in the first place. I will. Holy shit! How did you know that was gonna work? I didn't. Cops are pigs and men are pigs... ...so I figured he'd be a double pig. I guess I was right. What if it didn't work? - Plan B. - What was Plan B? Shoot him in the face. You're funny, Violet. Good. You look like you need a little funny in your life, Chip. Shit. You got a problem with this? Not in the slightest. I need 40 bucks worth of gas. Which pump? The one that has a car parked in front of it. - That'll be 40 bucks. - Sorry. Sure is a lot of money for a guy with such a shitty ride. What did you do? Rob a bank? Yeah, funny. Can I just get my change, please? I'm kind of in a hurry. Why are you in a hurry at this time of night? - You always this nosy? - I mind my own business. Most of the time. Well, how about most of the time is right now? Maybe you robbed a bank and maybe you didn't. Either way, that's a lot of cash you got right there. So? What if the cops come by asking if I saw anybody suspicious? It does happen, you know. I don't know what you're talking about. I just want some gas, okay? And I just want two of those bills in that envelope. You leave them right here, and I won't pick up the phone... ...and tell the cops I saw some shady-lookin' asshole in here... ...with an envelope full of cash in a 2004 red Mustang... - ...with a license plate number... - Fine, okay? Fine. Here you go. Don't even think about it, skank. Now, listen up, you little emo cunt. I heard what you were saying to my boyfriend. You have got some nerve... ...but this, this is my money. If you want my money, you're gonna take it from me, not him. You think it's gonna be easy to do that because you wear black makeup... ...and cut yourself to sleep? You think you can take me because I'm a pretty girl? Well, go ahead, try it. I am begging you. The day that I've had, I'm just looking for an excuse to put somebody in a coffin. Though by the looks of it, you'd probably like that. So, what's it gonna be, Hot Topic? 40 bucks worth of gas... ...or 200 bucks worth of whoop-ass? Yeah. Whatever, bitch. Come on, Chip. What the hell were you thinking, Chip? I can't believe you were just going to give her the money like that. - It's just a couple of hundred bucks. - That's not the point. - Well, what is the point? - The point is... ...in the last few hours I've known you, you've let a woman manipulate you... ...into murder and kidnapping and that one would have extorted you... ...if I hadn't stepped in. Chip, you got to learn how to stand up for yourself... ...otherwise you're gonna get eaten alive. Maybe you're right. Okay, yes, you are definitely right. Look, it's been a long day. There's a hotel up the road. Let's just go there. We'll get a room. We'll grab a few hours sleep. No. You got to go back in there and kill her. What? No. That... the last thing we need right now is more vio... No, Vi... I'm not gonna go back in there and kill her. That is exactly what I'm talking about, Chip. See, it's not so hard now, is it? - This place is a dump. - Yeah, the Ritz Carlton was booked. Good God, what a day. I am dead on my feet. Take off your clothes and get in here, Chip. What's wrong? - We don't have to. - Yes, we do. And we're gonna... ...and we're both gonna like it. There's just something you need to know first. Don't worry, I have a condom in my wallet so if you have herpes or whatever... No, Chip, no. - I don't have herpes. - Good, neither do I. - What is it? - Well... ...I was at the McKenzies tonight because... ...well, I guess you could say I sort of worked for them. Doing what? Doing stuff for them. Sex stuff. I never ever told anyone that before. Not like I have anyone to tell. People think I'm weird. Don't say that. Why not? It's the truth. I used to work for Ken... ...like real work, administrative stuff. He'd always flirt with me while I was in the office and... ...I'd just put up with it. Well... ...Madge came into the office one day and... ...took one look at me, and pretty soon Ken is pressuring me for a threesome. I mean, really pressuring me. I told him I wasn't interested and he fired me. But that wasn't enough for Ken. I guess he was golf buddies with my landlord and... ...he made one phone call, and the next thing I know I'm out on the street. So there I am with no money and no job... ...and no place to live and no one to turn to for help... ...so they finally got me. - I was desperate. You understand? - I do. Believe me I do. - I'm not a whore. - I don't think you are. I didn't say that. Well, I'm not. That didn't stop them from treating me like one though. Now, I kind of wish it was me that killed them. I don't. Better that Liza did it. She was already foul. You're a good guy, Chip. I knew you were sweet from the moment I saw you. - You're not disgusted by me, are you? - No, of course not. Of course not. Good. It's been a long time since I made the decision to make love... ...and how and with who. You want to help me break that streak? Jesus, how did I sleep so late? My head feels like I drank a fifth of whiskey. What did you do to me last night, Violet? Fuck. Violet? No. No. No. No. No. Violet? Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Where's my fucking clothes? You fucking thorough-ass cunt. Hallelujah, you're fucked, Chip. You're so fucking stupid, Chip. Every time a pretty face pops up your brain turns into a goddamn potato. Shit. Calm down. Calming down in three, two, one! Get calm. Get it fucking together. Fuck. No. Liza. - Hi. - Problem, sir? Yeah. Yeah, I guess you could say that. Look, I'm... I'm in a little bit of a situation here... ...and I was wondering if I could maybe use your phone? - What about the phone in your room? - It's out of order. Your situation... it has something to do... ...with that party last night perhaps? - What? - My nephew told me all about it. Said there was quite a bit of ruckus. Look, I'm so sorry, but honestly, I don't... I don't remember anything. She must have roofied me or something. That... Shit. That's exactly what she... She freaking roofied me. Look, just last night I was drugged, okay? And now my, my clothes, my money, my car and my phone are all gone. But if I can just use your phone I can fix it all, okay? I just need to make one phone call, please. You may make your call. We have a lost and found box. Perhaps we can find you some temporary clothing there. That'd be so awesome. Thank you so much. - You must dial nine first. - Okay. - Who the hell is this? - Who do you think it is? Chip? Where in the fuck are you? I've been trying to call you all morning. You know exactly where I am. The question is where the fuck are you? Hey, just got back from a night in the hospital thanks to you, you asshole. Now the cops want to question me and the Camaro is impounded... ...and you got my fucking car and my fucking money. Now, where in the fuck... ...are you? Chip? Did you hear me? Chip, are you there? If you aren't back in this trailer in 30 minutes with my car and my money... ...I will find you. I will hunt you down and I will cut off your dick... ...and feed it to the neighbor's dog. You hear me? Don't think I won't do it. I will find you, Chip. I swear to God. Are you listening to me? Bad news, Mr. Delacroix? Yeah, you might say that. This party that your nephew saw, did he happen to see anybody going into my room? Hadi said many people were coming and going all night. He did mention one girl in particular. Said she was a real... ...you know? No, no, I don't. What... did he say what she looked like? Hadid said she looked like a dead girl. - Dead girl. - You know, pale skin and the black makeup. Fuck. Is that your car out there? Yes, it is. Why? I'm so sorry about this, sir. Sorry about what, Mr. Delacroix? Please don't be dead. Please don't be dead. - Hey, what are you doing? - I am so sorry. I really am. But I am really in a bind and I need your car. No! And a couple of bucks just in case your car needs gas. Please don't look at me like that. I don't want to do this either, okay? Fucking. Sweet. Fucking clog. Fuck! You've reached the White Rose Motel on Route 41. We're unable to take your reservation at the moment. Leave your name and phone number. We will return your call as soon as possible. Have a wonderful day. Hey there, Amy. - Yeah, can I help you? - You know what, I sure hope so. I'm looking for the girl who was working here last night. - Skinny, dark hair, looked kind of gothy. - You mean, Monica? Yeah, Monica. Do you have any idea where she might be? Aren't you a little old to be sniffing around that bitch? - I'm not even... I'm not even 30. - Could have fooled me. It's the shitty outfit that threw me off, I guess. Thank you very much. You know, you're not so bad yourself. Cool. Do you want to go in the back and eat my pussy? Well, that is one hell of an offer but I am in a real rush... ...and it is very important that I talk to Monica right now. Well, I can tell you exactly where to find that whore... ...and I don't even care if you're a stalker or something. You can cut her head off and flush it down the toilet for all I care. But that info isn't free. Amy, look, I've only got a few bucks on me. But I'd be willing to... I'm not looking for money. What do you want? Lucky for you I forgot the panties today. It gets a bit sweaty down there otherwise. If I do this, you'll tell me where to find Monica? Jesus, you're slow. Ain't that what I just said? Yeah. I guess it was. Well, come on. Hurry up. I ain't got all day. Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Drop the club, shithead. Nice gun. You like it? I stole it from this dumbass I roofied last night. - Hey, baby girl. - Good, you didn't start without me. What the fuck? You told them I was coming? Genius, you figured it out. Your detective skills are about as good as your pussy-eating skills. Hell to the yeah. This is gonna be good. I left work early to see this. Better be worth it. Where my bitch at? Give me a goddamn minute, Amy, Jesus. Help me. Chip. Heard you were coming. - How's old Cody today? - Couldn't get it up as usual. Why are you still fucking for cash, Monica? You're rich know, girl. It's easy money, fatty. This pussy's like a man. Sixty-eight grand is a decent score but it ain't no retirement fund. You like the view? Yeah, you better enjoy it. These are the last tits you're ever gonna see. You should've just stayed in bed this morning, Chip... ...like you were supposed to. You ran off somewhere else. Anything but come here. Coming here was about the dumbest decision you ever made. Let me see that. I do believe the little dummy is pissed at me. If you're gonna kill me, just do it. You're giving up already, pussy? I'm not ready to kill you just yet. No, we're gonna have a little fun with you first. Well, fun for us anyways. Hey! Who's the pussy now? Now, give me my money, give me my clothes, give me my wallet and my fucking car keys. Please do something stupid again, Chip. Because I'm dying to blow your kneecap the fuck off. The kid. Kid? You mean that little shithead with the perfect timing? He's a neighbor. I sent his little ass home. - Mommy's home, y'all. - Hey, baby girl. Party favors. Look who's finally awake. - You ready to party, Chip? - I think I'll pass, actually. Well, you're the guest of honor. That was for punching me, Chip. And this... ...that was for trying to escape. This... ...well, that one was just because I fucking felt like it. Get his pitiful ass back in the chair, Leroy. Upsy-daisy, dipshit. Thanks to you and your money, Chip, we're gonna get fucked up tonight. And the more fucked up we get the more fucked up it's gonna get for you. - Why? - You're the one who came looking for trouble. You should be asking yourself that question. Why did you kill her? Yeah, well, I killed her because she was mouthy. Not fucking emo and I sure as shit don't shop at Hot fucking Topic. And you, well, you were supposed to get busted for it. The cops come, see you and the body in the room, cart you off to jail. Nobody believes you when you start crying about missing money. Why did you take my clothes and my car then? Didn't want you fleeing the scene, dumbass. Doesn't make any sense. The cops would just wonder what happened to my stuff... ...and it made it look like the frame-up that it was. We were high as fuck, asshole. Seemed like a great idea at the time. Well, who's the dumb ass now? That attitude, well, that ain't gonna make your night any easier. Anymore stupid questions before we get this party started? Yeah. Can you just please let me go? What a fuckin' idiot! "Can you let me go?" If it was just about the money, Chip... ...I might consider that. But a guy like you, nah... ...you're not gonna forget the girl. Might take some time, but you'll come back looking for revenge and I can't have that. Also I'm gonna enjoy killing you... ...because I'm just bent that way. Turn that music up so I don't have to hear his cryin'. And get me some rails lined up. It's gonna be a long night. Bitch! I ain't afraid of nothing, bitch! I feel bad for you, Chip. We're gonna put you out of your misery. It's a mighty big mess you're standing in there, Chip. I'm so sorry for what happened to you, Violet. I know, baby. It's not your fault. You tried. We were supposed to get away and start fresh. Now, look at it. I can't even use it. It's ruined. It's just a little bit of blood. All money's got blood on it one way or another. Be a shame to leave it there like that. I'd rather have you. I know, Chip. But it's not in the cards right now. Where are we? It's... Shit, I'm dead, aren't I? Not yet, but you will be if you don't wake up. I've told you before, you have got to start learning how to stand up for yourself. Otherwise, you're gonna get eaten alive. And that is exactly what's gonna happen if you don't wake up. So wake up. I said wake up. Liza? Jesus, look at you. They really messed you up, didn't they? They put flip-flops on you? Those sick fuckers. - Please tell me your dick's still okay. - How did you find me? I told you I was gonna hunt you down. What? You didn't believe me? Listen, these people are crazy. You don't know fucking crazy, honey. - Where's the money? - I don't know. I don't know. They took it. Who the fuck are you? The adults are trying to have a little discussion over here. I'll deal with you in a second. You have no idea who you're fucking with. I think I do. I just don't give a shit. Enough of this shit. Kill them both, Leroy. A woman calling the shots. I like it. If you ask me, there should be a few more of us in the world, but... ...right here, right now... ...I'm Queen Bitch. Put that gun down before someone gets their dick shot off, Leroy. Fuck you. I warned you. - Holy shit! - Holy shit! - Hey, Chip. - Hey, Dwayne. - Holy fuck. - Yeah, holy fuck is right. You're kidding me. Jesus, Chip, get up off the floor before you catch the AIDS or some shit. Where is my fuckin' money? It's in a box under the bed in there. Just take it. Take him and get the fuck out of here. Thank you... ...for giving me permission to take back what's already mine. Dwayne? There you are. - Go check that out for me, would you? - You're so pretty. Yeah, well, it's not like we can actually keep them alive. Go on, do what you're gonna do. Hurry up, big brother. We don't got all day. I need privacy. Oh, my God, okay. Take them back there. Get my money when you're done. I'm gonna talk to Chip. Don't you fucking touch me. Don't. No. Get... no! Stop it! Get off me! Get off. Chip! Chip, come on. Chip. Fucking annoying. Where's what's-her-name? That whore from the trunk? - You mean Violet? - Yeah, whatever. She's dead. They killed her. You son of a bitch. Seriously? One night without me and you fall for a dead tramp? Are you fucking kidding me? You hit me on the back of the head. You steal my money. You cheat on me with a whore. This is not exactly what I call a healthy relationship, Chip. - Yeah, no kidding. - Dwayne says I should kill your ass. Says I can frame you for everything. The McKenzies, everybody here, even his dead crack whore. He's not altogether wrong. Dwayne's got some weird ideas about stuff. I mean, I'm a little left of center but... ...the idea of running off in the sunset with Dwayne isn't exactly appealing. I mean, I'm crazy, I'm just not incest crazy, particularly with him. He doesn't understand our dynamic. The nature of us. If someone else stole my money, they'd be dead by now. Dammit, Chip, I love you. - You do? - Yeah. Of course. You never said that to me before. I understand, okay? I know what's going on. You got scared. You strayed... ...like a little puppy on the Fourth of July. The fireworks are a little too much for him. Right? But as the owner of that dog, you just got a few options. You can let him run away, you can hunt him down and kill him... ...or you can discipline him. Teach him to heel or whatever he's supposed to do. So, Chip... ...what option do you want? Violet said there's always another option. She did, did she? And what option is that? I'm not your dog, Liza... ...and you're not my owner. Where are you going? Away. You're not leaving me. Yeah, I am. What about the money? Hey! You don't get to just walk away from me like that. You're gonna stop and you're gonna turn around and you will come back to me. And then, you're gonna kiss the back of my hand. Beg for my forgiveness. Because the next step you take in that direction... ...is gonna be your last. Good job, sis. I'm sorry, Liza. I didn't want to. It's okay. Normally, I can't get off twice like this but... ...you're so hot. It's not gonna be any problem for me. You're so pretty. I'm really gonna enjoy doing... Oh, my God! You saved me from that freak fucking pervert. Jesus, God, thank you. Look, I know I did some fucked up shit, okay? It's just... ...it's the way I am. I can't help it. I'm sorry, okay? It's over now, Chip. You saved me. We can take that money, you and me. Get the fuck out of here. I'll do anything you want, Chip. Anything I want? Yeah, baby. Anything you want. I want you to bring back Violet. That's fucking nuts. When they come in... Shit, that's not good.
