Today is a very special day. Whoa, look at her go! - Hey! ♪ Hey hey hey hey ♪ - Look at me, I graduated! - That's my big sister. Okay, so, here's what's happening. Our dad is asleep right now. Look at that. My gosh. Hi! - Happy birthday, Mom. - Thanks! Aw. - Happy birthday, dear. You're still as beautiful as the day I met you. - Aw. - Aww. - Don't forget, you're opening tomorrow. - Aw! - That's great, Dad. - Happy birthday, Mom. - Thanks! - I love you so, so much. Thank you for all that you do. - Thank you for being here! - Aww. Thanks for cleaning my dirty underwear. - You're welcome. - That is so gross. Can you, like, grow up? - For sure. - Anything else to say? - Yeah, where's our food? I know, that's exactly what I was thinking. No, you're meant to say something, like, nice. - Okay, Mom, thanks for birthing me. - Gross. - You're welcome! Get some more rotation on the ball when you're shooting. - More what? - More rotation. Good. Better. - You sure this thing's not gonna break? - It hasn't come down in 20 years. It's not gonna happen today. Okay? Now hustle up, school starts in the morning. - Dad, I'm tired, and Vee's gonna be pissed. - Valerie's gonna be fine. She'll have extra time to do her hair. - That's a bit sexist. - How's that sexist? - Well, it's definitely not woke. - Me being non-white makes me woke by default. Okay? Yeah, Dad, that's that's not how it works. Jake, don't sass me. Okay? I came home early to help you with this. Okay, don't use me as an excuse so you can play hooky. Please? Shit! - You okay? - Yeah. It's that shit knee again. I'm fine. Now you're stuck. Don't double dribble. Square up your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through- - The wrist. God, Dad, I know. - What was that? You didn't follow through. - I did. - Okay. Let's try again. Okay? This time, drive to the hoop. - Dad, can we just please- - Come on. Let's go. Shit. Jake, you all right? - No! You smashed the ball into my hand. - Let's see. Your uncle used to do that to me all the time. - Yeah, and look at you now! - You'll be fine. Shake it off. - Sh... I'm done, Dad! - Jake. Goddammit. I don't have any new one - Hey. This is all I could find in your closet. Thanks. - So, what, he just, like, smashed the ball back at you? - He's an over-aggro washed-up sack of leftovers trying to relive his... What? Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I drove too hard to the net when I wasn't open. - So what's gonna happen with tryouts now? I don't know. Stay on as Coach's assistant. - Social media manager. Right, thanks. - On the bright side, if you can't try out for basketball, then that means more time with me. Maybe we could finally, you know. So, my sister finally caved and bought me a pack of condoms. Wow. That's, that's so- - Awesome of her, right? - Yeah. Yeah. Are you crazy? - What? Your dad's still shooting hoops. Janet's out, and no one else is home. - Vee, this feels kind of risky, maybe we- - Yeah, that's what makes it hot. - Okay, Vee? Vee. I love you. - And I love you. - We said we would wait. - Until we move in together? That's like a year away. - This is just, this is a big deal. - I like your big deal. - Soon. Soon, okay? Seriously. I promise. - Well, how's the kitchen doing? I don't know, in an hour or so. Well, this was important, too. For Jake. Yeah. Hold on. How's the hand? Just, take it easy tonight, okay? They're gonna be, drinking at this thing? - Yeah, like you didn't drink at our age, Dad. Come on. - How do you think I became a dad so young? Just, don't overdo it. Okay? And if you do, wrap it up. - What time are you gonna be home? - Don't worry, he's in good hands, Mr. Wong. - All right. Have fun, you two. - I told you. - "Wrap it up, Jake." "Wrap it up." - "Wrap it up." "Wrap it up." Bye! What up, boys? - What up, man? - Yo yo. - What's up? - Looks like Penny finally filled out. - Nice. Dude, did you see that new bikini shot on Mary's Robogram? Look, look. - You know, you guys ever try actually, like, talking to these girls? - Dude, I barely had the nerve to invite them, so, like, what am I gonna say to them? You too cool for boobs now? Valerie finally cave? - Shit. Are you getting some? - No, okay? Trust me, I've tried. She still won't budge. - After almost two years together. - Yeah, she's waiting for marriage. Whatever. - I mean, at least she's doing hand stuff, right? God's okay with hand stuff. - And mouth stuff. - Yeah, yeah, totally. Totally. - Jake, milk it for as long as you can. She's the one milkin' it, right? What happened? - My dad played on the rough side. - You gonna be okay for tryouts? - Yeah, don't worry about me. I got my right. Yo, not to sound like an asshole, man, but- - You've never made the team with a good hand, so don't know how you're gonna pull this off. Yeah, screw you guys, man. No, where's Val? - Hey, hun, how was the... What'd you do? What happened to cooling it with the basketball? - I like basketball. - You screw up your knee whenever you play. - I don't always. - And while you were out training Jake for a sport he doesn't even like- - Don't say that. He likes it. - He likes being- - He's trying... - He likes being the coach's assistant. - He's only doing that so he can be on the court where he wants to be. - We got slammed, and now what? How are you gonna help out with that limp? Can we please not start 30 seconds into my arrival? - You're right. - I'm sorry for jumping down your throat. I should have been here. - I'm sorry, too. - I'm gonna go check on the kitchen. You're a cook now? - Don't start. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I see? - Okay, if I could afford a new lens, they'd turn out, like, way better, but... These are great, babe. Yeah. - Can we? Here. - Yeah. - Happy Labor Day, everyone. Can't believe we start our last year of high school tomorrow. So exciting! The most exciting. Leopards rule! - Catch you leopards in the AM. No, my hair's messed. Can we do it again? - Yeah. Okay. - Hey. - Babe... What? - One second. Okay. - Happy Labor Day, everyone! Can't believe we start our last year of high school together. - Pass it, pass it! - Pick it up. - Whoo! - Watch your back. Here. - Ron! - Nice. - Let's go. - Here we go. - Come on. - Post up, post up! - Yeah, on me, on me, on me. - Get off me! - Nice! - Okay, okay. - Ooh! - Kid's on fire. - Okay. - Sam. Hey, Jake. You want in? Shit, wait wait! - Shit, dude! - Ron! Shit! What did you do that for? - Sorry, Val. I was just trying to get Jake in the game. Just thought he'd like to get off the bench for once. Ball didn't hit you, though, did it? - Ew. Are you okay? - He's an asshole. - I know. - Shit, dude. Does it hurt? Come on! Goddammit! - Ron, look what you did. - Not cool, man. - He dropped it. Not me. - Screw you! - What? - We playing or what? - Why do you hang out with him again? - He's the team captain and the MVP. - We need him. - Those are lame excuses, guys. Cheers! - Yeah. - I know. - Well, don't let me hold you up. - Jake. Come on, don't go. - Yeah, I can't play, Sam, so... - Yo, boys, let's go! Play! - Thanks for the party. - Hey. - Hey. - You hungry? - Always. What are you doing home? - I live here, too, you know. Do you? Har har. - I'm taking it easy tonight. Gotta get my head screwed on straight for this next semester. Okay. Here you go. - Shit, Janet. That smells amazing. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna try my right hand. - Okay, let's see you do it. Well? - It's good. - That's it? - Yeah. What do you want, a medal? Yeah? Well, does it not remind you of anything? - It reminds me of noodles, so that's pretty good. - Look behind you. - Shit, you found her recipe book? - No, just going from memory. - Well, you nailed it. Says the palate of a 17-year-old. - Hey, I'm refined. Okay? - Really? Let me see. - Hey, just eat your own. What is wrong with you? - Let me try. Something's missing. Excited about school starting? - Nah. You? - Yes and no. I mean, this term's focusing on baking, and I'm no baker, so... - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - How'd you know for sure that you, like, you know, wanted to go into culinary school? Felt it in my bones, as they say. - Why? I dunno. - What do your bones tell you? And please don't say basketball. My God, sometimes I just wish that... - Hey, you two. - Hey, Mom. - Is your Dad here? - Nope. - Don't fill up on that. I brought home wrong orders. But I cooked. Mom. Mom? I cooked. - Grandma's noodles. - Yeah, but something's missing, though. Maybe you can help? I started work today at 10:00 AM. I've been starting at 10:00 and finishing at 11:00 for almost 20 years. Do you really want to work hours like that? - If it's with food, yes. You know, we are not even asking you to be a doctor or a lawyer like our parents did. You know, why not be a plumber? Do you know how much they charge to fix a clog in the middle of dinner service? You know, it's just, all that tuition and for what? - Which I'm paying myself, thank you very much. - Yeah, but we'll be paying for whatever it is that you decide to do once the kitchen burns you out. - You should try some, though, Mom. Like, seriously. It's freaking good. Just give it a taste. - See? It's, it's good, right? - You don't get into the restaurant biz. Do anything else. Anything. I'm going to bed. - Night! - Where do you think Dad is? So you don't remember? No. - Hey! How you doing? Listen, we've talked about it, and we're sorry about what happened yesterday, we didn't- - Yeah, don't worry about it, we're all good. - Yeah? - Yeah. We're good. - All right. - Cool? - Yeah. - Hey, we'll see you at lunch, then. - See you at lunch. - See ya. - Hey. So yesterday in your room was really hot. Can we do it again? Soon? Today? Yes? - You know, I want to, but, like, Janet might be home, and I don't know her schedule this term. - Like she even cares. Besides, we'll just tell her that we're looking at university brochures in your bedroom. Which we should actually start doing, by the way. - Okay, yes. Okay. Brochures. I promise. - And the other thing? - Yeah. And the other thing. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Shit. Sorry, I didn't see you there. - It's my bad. - You live across the alley, right? - Yeah. Yeah, that's me. - Yeah. You moving in on Labor Day? - Yeah! Yeah. Not by choice, believe me. - Um. - Um... - Dude, you look lost. - I... I am. - You are. - You are, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Can I see that? - Yeah. Ooh, Mr. Roberts? - That's brutal. Trust me. Final bell's about to go. Follow me. No, this way. - I just went that way. - Yeah. Come on! - You sure you know where you're going? - Yeah, trust me. This is it. All right, everyone, today- - You're pretty fast. - Yeah. You're not too bad yourself. I'm, I'm Jake. Jake Wong. - Hey, Aleks Chen. Hey. Shit, you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm okay. It's just, you know, it's an old basketball injury. We're gonna jump into- - I actually, um, I play, too, you know. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sweet. We should play some time. Once this gets better. - Yeah, that sounds like fun. - Cool. - Cool. Well, thanks for the GPS. - Don't mention it. - 231, up the stairs. - Good luck. - Cool. Shit. - Let's take a break. It's the weekend! - I'm already taking a break. I've been taking a break for the last two hours. What have you been doing? Come on! Wait wait wait. - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Why don't you wanna have sex? - Okay, it's, it's not that I don't want to have sex. - What? I want it to be special, too, but what makes it special is that it's you and me. - I know that, but this is, like, this is a big thing we're talking about here. - We've done, like, everything else, what's the difference? Is it me? Or... - No. Hey, no. - Girls want sex, too, you know. - I know that. I don't know, Vee. I think I'm just scared. - Of what? - Of everything changing. - Nothing's gonna change, I promise. - No, you can't promise that, Vee. - I can because I love you. - I love you, too, Vee. You're my best friend. Take this off for me? - Yeah. - You know, if I had two hands, it'd be million times easier. - I know, I know. Be careful. Your hand. Slowly, slowly. - Okay. Wait right here. - Are, are, are we, really? - Yeah. I got it. - You sure? - Yeah. I love you so much, Vee. - I love you too. Andrea. Andrea. Andrea! Where you been? We're getting hammered out there. Lucy called in sick, and you're doing what, exactly? - Dealing with a supply order. - Stop daydreaming. We need to clear those tables. The office next door took the entire staff out for dinner, and I can't handle it with my knee. - Okay. Just give me a second. - For what? Andrea, hurry up! - Don't talk to me like this is my problem. This is your family's place. Jesus. - My, my family? We're family. - I'm done. - Where are you going? I'm sick of Chinese food! - Just be careful. - Thank you. That was amazing. - You're amazing. - Get outta here, Vee. - See you, J-Pop! - Bye! - Hey! J-Pop. You heard that? God. Sorry. - Nah, don't be. It's cute. My boyfriend used to call me Sexy Leksy. Ex-boyfriend, I mean. So you're, um- - A top. Yeah, I thought the whole school knew. - I was, I was gonna say single. - And yeah, they, they know you're a top. - Good. - Been out here long? - Yeah, just um dribbling up and down the alley. I don't have a net yet, so... - Hey, you, you can play on mine if you want. - I mean, it looks like it's gonna fall apart. - Yeah, no, it's definitely a million years old, but... You break it, you buy it. How about that? - You sure your hand is up to it? - Yeah! I'll be fine. - Okay. You did that practicing for tryouts? Yeah. You trying out? - Yeah, definitely. - Cool. - Okay. Everyone on the team as good as you? Well, I've never actually made the team, so... - I can see why. - Shut up. You want friends at school or not? - I'm teasing! - Yeah, all right. - Look, you only shoot and dribble left-handed, right? - You gotta learn both sides if you wanna make it on the team. Cool? Yes. Cool. Just like that? - So, line it up. There you go. Control your nerves. And follow through with the wrist. You got it. - Yeah. Yeah, I got it. - See? Damn! - Stick with me, and I'll get you there. One-on-one? - One-on-one. Hi. You've reached Andrea Wong. I'm sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message at the sound of the beep. Thanks. - See? - That's my Dad. - I'll introduce you guys. - Cool. - Hey. Who's this? - This is Aleks. He just moved in behind us. - Hey, Mr. Wong. - Call me George. Good to meet you, Aleks. See you're helping with Jake's game. - Yeah, trying to work on his right-handed approach 'cause, well, you know. Right. Where's your mom? - You tell me. Usually right behind you. - Right. Maybe Janet'll know. She here? No, she said she's, like, on a dumpling tour or something. - Dumpling tour? - Dumpling tour? - Yeah, it sounded weird when she said it, but I thought- - Dumpling tour? That sounds awesome. You know what that is? - I don't know anything about that. Doesn't matter. I'm sure she's fine. Both of them. So, you mind if I get next? - Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Great. Bring it. - Aggro much? - Calling foul, Jake? - No. What's gotten into you? - Nothing. Aleks, your ball. - Okay. - Yeah. Let's see what you got. Good check. Good check. It's not like it's gonna be forever, so, like, why am I worried? - I have no idea. - Hey. - Hey, Jake. - Hey. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. - Hey, what's up? - I can't believe she gave it up to you, of all the people. - What the hell is your problem? What'd you last, like, 10 seconds? See you two on the court. - "See you two on the court." Why are the hot ones always such assholes? - Yeah. Hey, you got a charger I can borrow? - Yeah. - Hey. - What's up? - All right! Partner up and warm up! Time to shine, people. - Hey! - Hey. - Listen, I've, I've got you, and you got this. Okay? - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Hustle! Hustle! Hustle! Come on! Okay, high knees, let's go. Let's go. Ooh! - Let's do it again! Whoo! - Let's see what you got. Come on, get him! Divvy up into two teams, run a game, see who stays and who goes. Let's see something! Where's the pick? - Go! - No, no, no! There we go! There we go. - Whoo! Get on him. All right! Here we go. - Never even saw it, right? So it was like sore, and yeah, it was hilarious. There's this huge scar... - Playing with the new kid paid off. You know, just be careful he doesn't give you any gay. Otherwise, Val might find bigger and better things. God, are you miming yourself getting a blow job from Valerie? 'Cause that's masturbatory, creepy, and I'm gonna tell her. - Whatever. You know, Val deserves better than you, Jakey Two-inch. - Lay off him, Ronald. - How is he getting laid? By her? Wait, he didn't tell you two? Yeah. Jake is finally a man now. Check the Gram. - Dude, is that true? - She caved? - Who cares? It was probably so bad, it'll never happen again. - You are such an asshole! - Yeah? - Yeah! Yeah, no one likes you. And we only put up with you because you're the captain and, until now, our best player. And no, no, Aleks didn't give me any gay. That's not how it works, you caveman. - Me thinks the jock doth protests too much. - The hell does that mean? - It means for a straight guy, you're a little too obsessed with Jake's virginity. - I'm not gay, you dick! I'm pissed that he got Valerie's V-card! - Are you sure about that? Nice. - Get a room! - If you're still not hard, you should see a dick doctor. - Back off! You, you fucking fa- - What? Yeah. That's what I thought. Hope you all enjoyed the show. If I make the team, there's plenty more where that came from. Boys. - Hey, man. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. - Is it true about Valerie? No, man. Come on, I told you. She's waiting for marriage, remember? - Yeah, yeah. Shit. - Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Okay, okay, um... Only a few dozen likes, thank God. No one super gossipy saw it or, you know, our parents. - How could you be so careless, Vee? - It was an accident. I didn't see the wrapper. I was just trying to commemorate our special night. You know, like a little secret between you and me. I didn't mean to out us. Besides, why do you even care? You're a guy. If this had gotten out, you've be getting high-fives all around school. What do you think people would've said about me? - Fuck. Okay, yeah. You're right. I'm sorry, I just, I just can't... It just freaked me out to have that choice taken away from me. Our choice, from us. - Do you regret it? - Of course not. - Why don't we put out a different story? - What do you mean? - Like, um, we'll erase the old one, and and then we'll find something new that'll distract everyone. Hey, Robogram, here is a special episode of J-pop and Vee. Where are we going, babe? - Where it all began! Whoo! - It's time for... - J-Pop and Vee origins! Once upon a time, there was an eight-year-old J-Pop, and he got this plastic ring from the dentist. And he crushed hard on his classmate Vee. Then, at this very park, he saw his big shot. He, yeah, got down on both knees, and he proposed. - Both knees. What a gentleman. We got married at recess under the monkey bars. I'm all yours. Forever. Promise. - We broke up the next day. - Well, marriage is a big deal for a kid. - We finally made it real and official when he asked me out on this very spot just two years ago. - Two. - I think it worked. No one's talking about that other post except for Ronald. And thankfully, he's too stupid to have screen grabbed it. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just, I guess I'm just tired with the training and then the tryouts. What? I, I can't like basketball now? - I thought you're just doing it for your dad. I don't know. Yeah, maybe I'm just growing to like something new. - You over photography now? - Maybe. - You haven't finished your school application? - It's September. - Yeah, but school deadlines are like really soon. Do you need a push in the right direction here? - No, I'll get it done, okay? - Okay. - You get bored of shooting me, too? - No! Vee, the lens is still broken, that's, that's why. You're the only one I care about. I'm all yours. Forever. I promise. What's the word? I made it. - You made it? - I made it! - You made it! - I made it! - Way to go! Whoo! Dude, we're on the team! - We are gonna dominate. - Boys, let us celebrate. Come on! Hey, come on! - Whoo! Whoo! Jake, can I come in? - Yeah, just a second. Dad! - Ooh. Hey! - Aren't you supposed to be at work? - Come here. I'm on the way out, but I wanted to wish you luck today. It's your first game! - Yeah. Yeah, it's no big deal. - Yeah, it is, man. It's a big deal. We worked hard for this. I'm proud of you. Okay? - Okay. - Good luck today. Put some clothes on. - Don't barge in. I'm gonna jump today. Low gravity day. - Do it. - Yeah. - Do it. But you gotta tie your shoes first, man. Those are fucking ankle-breaking. Tipoff in 20 minutes, boys. Do the school proud. - All right, Coach. - Let's do it, Coach. - Hey! - Hey. - You okay? I don't know, I feel kinda sick. You're clammy as fuck. - Dude, I've never played before. - Want some water or something? - Aw! The back alley boys are having a moment. How sweet. - Screw you, Ronald. - Yeah, I bet you'd like to. Does that do it for you? - For God's sake, Ronald, we're about to get on the court. - You're our team captain, man. Act like it. - Why'd you join the team, Aleks? You just wanted to see more D, didn't you? Faggots. - Don't call us that. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell is going on in here? So you and Ronald started the fight? Not a peep from you as my number two, now you're attacking friends. - I wouldn't call them that, Coach. - Teammates, then, we're a team. Haven't you learned anything? Your father is gonna be crushed by this. He dreamed big. He dreamed even bigger for you. You're both suspended from the team. - He called us faggots, Coach! What was I supposed to do? - That's a very serious accusation. - Yeah. - I'm gonna have to get the administration involved in this. - So am I still gonna be suspended? - Jake, you broke Ronald's nose! - He deserved it. - He deserves punishment, not physical violence. Look, I love that you're playing this year. You impressed me, even, but actions have repercussions. We'll see about bringing you back in December. That is such bullshit. What a joke! You weren't there! Fuck! You did what? - I had to do something. That jerk bullied Aleks. He helped me. - I helped you. The whole summer. God. Mom, can you just... - You're making way too much out of this, George. It is just basketball. - Just bask- - Yes. - Did you even want this? I mean at all, Jake? Seriously? - Dinner? - I'll eat later. - I'm not hungry. I'm gonna go back, see if the kitchen needs help closing. - So? What'd you think? - You know, when I was your age, I didn't have anybody except for your dad. You know, my parents died when I was young. - I know that. - Just hear me out. They left me with just enough money to come out from Edmonton, go to school, where I met your dad. - Why are you telling me this again? - Because I was at a crossroads like you are now. And your dad was there for me, sure, but it's not the same as having my own family offering me wisdom. - Mom, I asked how dinner was, not for life advice. - As your family, I am telling you to please consider a different path. So, my choices get questioned to hell and back, but Jake's is just... Okay. What wisdom do you wish you got, then? - To not drop out. Either of us. To find something other than your grandparents' restaurant. - They made you guys take it over. You didn't have a choice. - Well- - So, stay in school is the moral of your story? - No, that's actually not what I'm trying to- - Well, I do have a choice, Mom, and that's what I'm going to do. - You're twisting what I'm trying to tell you. - Mom, I have a path that I love. Maybe you're the one who's searching for the right thing. You, making fortune cookies now? - I'm wiser than I look. - It is not bad. It just needs a bit more salt. - Thank you. Fine. My turn. - Hey. - Hey! Congrats on the win. - Thanks. And I never got to thank you, for, you know, what happened in the locker room. You're a good guy. - Yeah, man. I had to. You know? - You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. - Yeah? - Yeah, I think I'm just, like, tired or something and... What? You know, just like school applications and shit, it's just like so much, - you know what I mean? - Right. - The future and shit. - Yeah. - By the way, I saw the damage control you guys posted. My God. Thanks for keeping that to yourself. That was- - Stuff like that, it's, it's nobody's business. - Exactly. Yeah. So you know where you're applying yet? - Probably back east. I know we just moved here, but, um, I miss my friends. Your friends or your ex? Sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean like- - It's okay. No. Not him, anyway. I just, I don't know, I miss the vibe. I didn't wanna come out here in the first place, but Dad got transferred, and blah, blah, blah, blah. - Cool. Well... - Hey, you wanna come in? Watch a game? - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah, I've never actually like punched a guy before, so that was pretty sick. My God, my boys are imploding. Why do you do this to me? - Yeah. Sorry, pal, they're not coming back from this. You done? - Yeah. Why don't you seem more riled up by this? - What do you mean? I am so riled. I, I can't even understand what's happening... - Okay, then, who's your team? - Toronto. Duh. My God, are you just saying that because they're my favorite team? - Dude, come on. Hey, sorry if I crossed the line earlier. You know, about your ex. - It's cool. - Does it still hurt? - Less and less. - Good. Okay. Next question. - Yes. Shoot. - Who's your favorite player? for skill or hotness? Hotness. - Linsanity. - Nice. - Yeah. - Lin's dope. Us Asian ballers never get enough cuteness credit. What, you got hots for Yao Ming, too, I bet? - Hell yeah. Have you seen the size of his... feet? Yes! Hey! See? You have to drive to the outside and then drive it... Drive to the net. - Wait, wait. Just let me look at you, okay? - Okay, cowboy. - Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just wait. What's wrong? - This is a big deal. - Yeah. - But I've wanted to kiss you for a really long time. What was that? - I, I didn't hear anything, what? Shit. Those are my parents. - What? - Here. God. Here. Can you just hurry up, please? - You goddamn asshole. Why? Why did you do this? - I don't know. Bullshit. - I was feeling lost. It's a tough time for me. Look, can we just- - Do you think that you are the only one with bad times? Do you think that is the life that I wanted? I gave up on everything for you. This marriage, a fucking restaurant. But I would never betray you. - She's nothing. She doesn't matter. I swear to you, Andrea. - You made a promise to me. This isn't it. Get out. Get out! - Andrea. - Get out! Get out, you fucking cheater! Get out! Get out, get out, get out! - Hey, hey, Jake. Look, I'm sorry that this is happening, just, just talk to me. - You need to go. Right now. - What? Really? - Go. Yeah, go. - You're just upset, - Just go. - hold on a sec. - Go. - Hold on a sec. Is this about your mom and dad, or is it about me? - This was just a mistake. I'm sorry. - Are you, are you for real? - Go. - Jake- - Just go! - Jake. Don't- - Fucking go. My God, what happened? - My fucking hand. Just go. Please. - I'm sorry. - Mom? Mom? Hey, hey, hey, why are you... Are you okay? It's okay. It's okay. - Is that the last of it? Yeah. Should be. - Um, when am I gonna see you guys next? - Just call us when you're settled in. - Jake? - Yeah, Dad, I don't know. I'm, like, swamped with like school applications and stuff. - Right. Miss you, pal. Why don't you friend me on your Robogram so I can see your face, you know, when I'm feeling down. - Yeah. Yeah, maybe. - How's the hand? Well, maybe shoot some hoops when you're feeling better. - Yeah, Dad, look, I don't know. Okay? It's not 100% - Well, not with me. Make sure you practice with Aleks. Stay sharp. - Is that everything? I'm gonna head back inside. - Hey. - Is that her? No. God, no. We're not a thing. I haven't seen her since... Look, kids, none of this was planned, alright? - Yeah. - I was just trying to- - Alright, cool. - What's up with him? - Is that even a serious question? - Hey. Can we talk? - You're a cheater. - There's no need to put disparaging labels on it, is there? - Mom looks so sad all the time. Do you know that? - I didn't mean to hurt her. I love your mom. I'm just not in love with her. Does that make sense? Look, I guess more than that, I wasn't in love with me and who I became. I want to be the kind of guy you look up to, the kind of guy you want to be. - I don't want to be you, Dad. Ever. - Look, we can talk about this as much or as little as you want. Hey. - Hey. - You being moody? - Always. What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. I just, I just have a lot on my mind right now. You know? My parents. - Shit, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. You don't have to be sorry. It's not your fault. - I got a new dress for winter formal. Do you wanna see it? - Yeah. - It's lilac, so I'm thinking you should probably get a lilac tie to match. - Wait, what's lilac? - You know what lilac is, it's like a light purple. See? What do you think? - I love it. Just gimme one second. - Isn't that still broken? - It doesn't matter. Ready? There we go. Nice. Yeah, strike a pose. Come here. I'm all yours, okay? Forever. I promise. - Okay. - So, hey. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Will you be my date for winter formal? - Ooh... - Come on, please. You're like my last resort. - Do you even have to ask? Okay. And, I also wanted to show you something else. - What is it? - Okay, just think of this as an apology for me being so distracted. Okay? - Okay. - One second. It'll be great, you'll love it. Okay. - Ta-da. My God, you finished your college application. - Yeah, it was important to you. Important for us. Come on, come on! Party! Party! Party! Party! - Whoo! We won! Yeah, we won! Shit, my dumbass admirer's here. What are you doing? Stop. - Yeah, I don't care who knows it! I love you! - I'm gonna get a drink. - Get me one, too? - Yeah, okay. - What's up, people? I'm at this party right now. Sam's house, my boy. I don't know why you're not here, but you need to be, and if you're not, I'll tell you about it tomorrow. I'm so sorry that I'm gonna see y'all, but I'm excited to see y'all, okay? Cheers. - What the hell? Stupid. Occupied. - It's Aleks. I'm worried about you. - I'm fine. - We haven't talked since, um, since you find out about your dad. Are you okay? - It's really none of your business. - Please don't shut me out, okay? I know how lonely this can be. - Your parents are together. - That's not what I'm talking about. - How can you be alone? You're on the freaking team, winning games and taking names- - Because I miss you. Why are you ignoring me? - I just made a mistake. - Ignoring me was a mistake or everything else was a mistake? - You know which, come on. - Why are you here? Look, um, Coach talked to me today. He's putting in a good word with the local college coaches instead of, instead of going back east. - That's good. Happy for you. - Look, what are you doing, Jake? You wanna play ball, and then you don't. You kiss me, and then you just run away. Are you just giving up on what you want now? Stop hiding and look at yourself. Shit. Jake? You in here? Jake? Jake? Shit. - What's going on? - Valerie, don't look. I can explain, okay? This is just like a huge, stupid mistake. Just... No, I can explain. Hey! Vee, wait. Vee! I don't understand, we... How long has this been going on? - Guys, this is my parents'... - What the fuck. - Shit. - Vee, please! - Just get, get your clothes on before coming downstairs. I'll try and calm her down. - Okay. - Hey, it's gonna be okay. - No. No, okay? I don't wanna talk to you. - Jake. - Okay? - Jake. - I don't wanna talk to you. - Valerie- - Don't fucking touch me! You're fucking gay? Tell me. How could you? W-was everything just pretend? Say something! - Stop telling me what the fuck to do! - And you! Wait, wait, no, no, no, no. He doesn't mean anything, Val. I swear, okay? Don't fucking touch me. - Hey. I'm not the bad guy here. - Fuck. I'm so sorry, man. Ask auto sales, and we'll tell you the... A 49-year-old unidentified man went berserk last night, opening fire with a 12-gauge shot... Happy birthday, Mom! Thanks! Happy birthday, dear. You're still as beautiful as the day I met you. Aww! Happy birthday, Mom. I love you so, so much. Thank you for all that you do. You're fucking gay? How could you? W-was everything just pretend? Say something! Stop telling me what the fuck to do! - Valerie's not answering at all. Sam and Gary can't find him. - What kind of video was this, again? About him being gay. - We've been driving in circles for hours. We have to find him. - I don't understand why Jake did this. Why didn't he just tell us? - Pull your head outta your butt for more than two seconds and see what you're doing to your kid. You both hate the restaurant, and you hate what it did to you two. That sucks, but don't take your resentment out on us. All Jake wanted was to make you happy, so much that he doesn't even know what he wants anymore. And, you know, all I wanted to do is cook goddamn Chinese food, and yet, you can't see past your own failed dreams to let us find ours. - Janet, check his Robogram. - That's like the first thing I did. Nothing. - He still hasn't friended me. Of course he hasn't. - He's friended you? - That's so not what it's called. - Of course he has. I'm his mom. - Guys, he won't post where he's at, he just wants privacy. It's time for... J-Pop and Vee origins! Once upon a time, there an eight-year-old J-Pop... - Wait, I think I might know where he is. - I'm so sorry, Vee. Shit. Shit, shit. - We must have just missed him. He's there, he's on the hoop. - Andrea. - Dad. I know, I know. - Stay here. - No way! I need to do this. - Mom! Mom. Mom, mom, mom, mom, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. - Jesus, Jake! Get down from there, you're gonna hurt yourself! No. - Listen to me, okay? Dad has to be the one to do this. - Shit. Jake, are you all right? - Am I all right? Wha, what the fuck? No, Dad! I'm very clearly not all right. Okay? I haven't fucking been all right since... I'm gay. What? What, Dad, you're just gonna fucking hug me now, like that's just gonna fucking solve everything? Jake, it's all gonna work out. - How? How, Dad? - Because we love you. Why didn't you just tell us? Tell me. - Are you serious, Dad? Are you fucking serious? What, what about the dream, Dad? How is being gay part of the fucking dream? - You can still play sports. You can still play ball. - I don't want to fucking play basketball! Wake up! I don't wanna fucking play ball! I don't wanna do what you want me to do. I don't want to anymore. I'm fucking done. Okay? You and your stupid... Do you know what your dreams did to me? You know what your stupid... I can't... Can you just hear me, please, Dad? I can't be who you want me to be. Okay? I can't be who anybody wants me to be. I'm not your goddamn trophy. - Jake, just let me- - No! Fuck, no! No, okay? You let me. Everyone... Everyone keeps pushing me. They all want me to be someone else, and I can't do that. - I'm sorry, Jake. I didn't know. - Everything that happened tonight, Dad. They... Fuck, they put me out there. - Hey, listen. - They fucking put me out there before I was ready. I don't even... - Listen. It's okay. It's okay. - Dad, it's not. Valerie hates me. - She'll understand. - Aleks and the whole school. I can't, I can't go back. We have to move. We have to go. - I know, no, no. - I want to fucking die, Dad. - No. No, no, no. - I want to fucking die. - I know. Jake, listen to me. You can still choose who you want to be. Okay? From this moment. Hear me? Who do you want to be? What's your dream? - I just wanna be happy. I just wanna be happy, Dad. - I know. I love you, Jake. We love you. It's okay. It's okay. - I don't know what to say to Valerie. Or Aleks. - It'll take time. But they can't hate you, for any of this. You know, it's just growing pains. - And if they do end up hating you, I'll give them all food poisoning. - Janet. - What? What? I, I'm serious. - Yeah. Thank you, Janet. - Yeah, you're welcome. It was nice seeing you two behave around each other today. - Yeah. Yeah. But, um... - We're, we're not good for each other. Not anymore. Um, we'll, um, separate for a while, make sure that's what we really want before we, you know. - What about the restaurant? - Your dad will look for a new business partner, someone who can buy me out of the restaurant. - Gonna be some big changes there. - What are you gonna do, Mom? - I think it's time I, um, go back to school. Find myself again. Right, Janet? - There you are. Wanted to say something before I left. So, everything you said this morning, I hear you loud and clear. I'm sorry I didn't before. - Don't let some stranger buy half the restaurant. They'll screw with the concept, force you out. - That's the point. Janet, you don't want this life. The hours, customers, inspectors, money. - It's not about the money. - You're a year into culinary school. You don't know what you want. - Yeah, I do. I do know what I want, Dad. - Janet, it's a terrible existence. - You hate it because Grandma and Grandpa made you do it. Right? No. The truth is, they didn't make me. I asked for it. I begged them. - You begged them? - I, I couldn't play basketball after my injury. I had no other skills. Then your mom got pregnant. So, I did it to support us all. I did it for you and Jake. - Well, do you, do you blame us? Me and Jake? - No, absolutely not. Looking at you now, it's the best thing I ever did. It's always been about you two. You know, you're close. Grandma's noodles, I mean. - Please don't do it. - You really want a taste of it? Weekends first. You start at the bottom, learn the ropes from the kitchen staff. Finish school. Then, maybe. One day. - Thank you. - I said maybe. And one day. And if you prove yourself, then you can buy me out. - Thank you. - Hey, man, Gary and I are worried about you because there's people talking at school, and there's rumors going around. - We just want to hear from you, man, make sure that you're okay. Will you please hit us back? Yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah. My gosh. - Hey, Jake. Please talk to us. Dude, we love you. All right? And we just want to hear from you. We know you're hurting. - And, and we get that it must have been hard keeping this a secret, but you don't have to anymore. - We're here for you. For anything and everything. Okay? So please, please, please hit us back. - Hey. Thanks for meeting me here. - Here's your shit. This whole thing was a goddamn trick, wasn't it? - Of course not. - Then you lied to me, this whole time? What, when I accidentally posted that picture, were you just ashamed that you lost it to me? - Of course not. - How can I believe you? - You've been lying to me for two years. Maybe even longer, I don't know. Jesus, if you lied about this, then what else- - Valerie, just stop! Just stop. I didn't lie to you. Okay? It's more complicated than that. Just, just try and put yourself in my shoes. Please. I've been trying to find me. Okay? The, the real me, this whole time. I just liked wearing this ring, back in grade two. But then you said that you thought it was pretty, so you made me give it to you, and then, you made me marry you at recess the next day. - I don't remember it like that. What, so you're saying I should have known you were gay 'cause you liked to wear a plastic ring to school? - No, I'm just saying that I did what you asked me to. And I've been doing that ever since. Vee, you are my best friend, okay? Please, don't leave me on my own like this. I need you. - Jake? What are you doing? - Students of Layton Secondary! - Hey, stop it. - My name is Jake Wong, and Valerie Ahmadi was my best friend, and I let her down. I need her to forgive me. I need her by my side. I'm lost without her. Please. I'm lost without you. - I'm sorry I hit you at the party. - I'm sorry for cheating. - Yeah, well... I really loved you. I still do. Really, it, kind of hurts. - I know. - Hey. - Hey. You, you weren't at practice today. - Yeah, I wasn't feeling well. Saw you turned down your spot on the team. - Yeah, I did. To be honest, I hated playing, and the only time I really had any fun was, when I was playing with you. - At your house and at the party, what you did to me was awful. You really hurt me. - I know. And I'm so sor... Can you please forgive me? - I don't, I don't know who you want to be, Jake. Hey. - Have you seen my shoes? I am gonna be late. - Yeah, I got 'em. Here. Thanks. - So, who is it tonight? - Waleed. From class. He wants to take me dancing. You don't dance. I haven't seen you- I was like. You look fab. Is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll be fine, Mom. - This is your night. Okay? - Okay. I love you. - I love you, too, Mom. Have fun tonight. - You too. - Yeah, go, you'll be late. - Ready? - I'm ready. - Boys, we are looking good today. - Looking fresh, dude. - Hey, guys? - Yeah? - See you guys in there. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. - Okay, man. We'll see you in there. - Hey. - Hey. It's, it's good to see you. - You too. You look... different. - Really? It's just the same thing that I posted earlier. - I didn't see it. Do you, do you like what you see now? - Do you? - Yeah. I just, I'm, I'm really sorry about everything I did to you. I hope you can forgive me. - Let's, let's work on it. Together. You wanna dance? - I'm actually really busy right now. - Are you? - Yeah. Just kidding. Yes.
