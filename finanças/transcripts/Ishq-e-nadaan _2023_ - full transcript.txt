Are you serious, Mr. Ashutosh? Should you be sleeping at this hour? I was on the night shift, Mr. Motilal. But what brings you here? Opening your eyes, what else? Look around. Construction is almost over on all the other plots. Except for you who isn't willing to leave. I will soon. I am looking for a new place. I'll move as soon as I find something. Mr. Ashutosh, you clearly said, you will leave when this plot's turn comes up. So it's time now. If you are having trouble, can I give you a hand? The world's making progress, but look at you. The world's making progress, but look at you. I am looking to my right. I don't see any orange car. No... It's so crowded. Line of cars, you say. It's like an amusement park. Where are you? I can't see you. Well... Here's what I'll do. I'll wait here for you. Wait a second. Let me tell you where. I am at... gate no. 3. Okay. Come here, okay. Found you. -Hello, mum. -Hello. -Did you have to wait for too long? -Yes. How was your flight? Don't ask. The seats are so cramped, one can end up having arthritis in the knees. one can end up having arthritis in the knees. -Allow me. -This way. Is Meenu at the office? She is having a busy week. Why do you two work so hard? What will you gain from all this? Well, work is a must. Madam. Madam. What... Careful, child. -Piyush, pass me the water. -Sure... What am I... What am I doing here? You passed out. Drink some water. -I need to go. -Drink some water. Cover your head when you venture out in the sun. Feeling better now? Sorry. -I... I just... -Call your family. -Someone will pick you up. -It's alright. -Should I call someone? -No, I will manage. I will manage. It's locked. Sorry. Child... where do you stay? Bandra. We're headed that way. We'll drop you. It's alright, aunty. I will manage. It's really hot out there. -We'll drop you. It's okay. -Fine. Yeah, not a problem. Okay. Piyush, drop me home first, and then you can drop her off. You seem new to Mumbai. Since you're not used to the heat. Though I was raised here-- But I was living in the US for the past couple of years. But I was living in the US for the past couple of years. College. Then job. Later I decided to come back. You did the right thing coming back. Just get married now, so you always have someone to-- Mom... -So sorry. -That's okay. No, aunty. I haven't given marriage a thought yet. I just want to work. Yeah... don't you want to get married at all? And just work. Mom, she regained consciousness two minutes again. Give her some room to breathe. -I am so sorry. -That's okay. Be quiet and focus on the road. You can get a view of Mumbai from here. Seventh floor, mum. Sit here. Relax. I'll see you. Since I'm running late for the office. I'll see you. Since I'm running late for the office. Meenu will be late, but Meghna will be home by evening. Actually, she has dance classes after school. If you need anything, Seema is here for you. -You can tell her. -Okay. Seema, take her downstairs and show her around. Yes. See you, mum. I'll see you in the evening. Okay. -Take care, Seema. -Yes. Would you like some tea, aunty? Yes, please. But where is my room? Your room? It's up ahead. Let me show you. I cleaned up your room yesterday. Come. Later I'll make a nice cup of tea for you. Come. It's so hot out here. Can I keep it here, aunty? Yes. Please. Did you have tea? Yes. I had one in the morning. And too much tea makes me unconfortable. And too much tea makes me unconfortable. I'll be in the kitchen. If you need me, just call. Thank you. Bye. I'll sit in the front. Drop her home, okay. Yes, mom. Please, go. The gas-pipeline guy will be here. Thinking about the gas-pipeline guy. You are unbelievable. -Bye, Siya. -Bye, thank you so much. Bye, mom. She's so sweet. -Shall we? -Yeah. Hey, I am sorry about my mom. Hey, I am sorry about my mom. She gets carried away. Don't worry about it. I guess at her age, every parent behaves like a prototype. So what do you do? Matrix Solutions. It's a consulting firm. I am a project manager. Nice. I hope you're not getting late for anything. Don't you get an off on weekends? No, I do have an off today. Sorry, I assumed you were in formals, so-- This. This-- It's a little embarrassing. Actually, for the past couple of weeks, mom likes to play 'matchmaker' on weekend. -So-- -Wow. So for her sake, I dressed up decently for the occasion. Of course. Is it a marriage or an interview? Things people do in an arranged marriage, God! Everyone is just following a protocol. Everyone is just following a protocol. So... am I? So, how was today's meeting? Any luck? Wow! That's so impressive. Meaning you'll get promoted in a year or two. And you can start your own firm after a couple of years of experience. Maybe? And, what about the future? Do you want to settle in Mumbai? I really like Mumbai, but spending my life here-- But we cannot ignore the luxury, money and lifestyle here. Yeah, I know-- And outside Mumbai, no one pays as much. -I know that. -But... don't mind. When we have a family, we'll have added responsibilities. You know how it works. Don't both people share responsibilities, right? I mean sounds weird. When I meet up with other guys, I am the one asking these questions. I am the one asking these questions. I know how it sounds. It is a little weird, but... But I wanted to be honest with you. Actually, I am looking for someone, who is career-oriented. Someone who doesn't get entrapped in family responsibilities, and starts ignoring her career. You know. I mean I want someone with a stable income. And even I can take care of household chores. In fact, I like doing all that. You mean you won't have a job. Of course, I will have a job. Of course, I will. But, it's not my first choice. Poonam, honestly I don't want to get in the work-life balance. I just want a life. Are you serious? No wonder she didn't say yes. What kind of a weird demand is that? Ouch! I mean don't get me wrong. I mean don't get me wrong. I have a lot of respect for anyone, especially, for women who can balance life and career. In fact, I find it hard to look after my own home since I got back. The point is with this laid-back approach, you will be just a house-husband. What's the future? Life will be stagnant. Exactly what I want. I want to get out of the cycle of growth-scope-blah-blah. Shortcut to happiness. Fair enough. Logically you are right. But you'll never get married being so blunt. You sound exactly like my parents. Just trying to help. I don't want to lie. I don't want to get married. What? Why? I don't know. I guess I could never understand loving just one person your whole life. Life gives you several opportunities. We should grab those and move on. And those who fail in doing so, And those who fail in doing so, are left alone even in a crowd. Don't you think? Deep. It's true. So what according to you is the solution to this problem? It's simple. Stay together if you are happy. No need to drag relationships unnecessarily. As they say, there is plenty of fish in the sea. Try swimming. Why do you want to deep dive? But falling in love, then consoling a broken heart. Not my cup of tea. Feel free to do so. Thank you for the advice. The world is on a different track, and you're heading down a different route. Nice. I must say you are pretty unique. You. Yes, you. Come up for some coffee. Maybe some other time. Sure? If you need anything, give me a call. Asking for my number? Asking for my number? No. Offering you mine. Help and number. Thank you. Much appreciated. Mama, I don't want to eat this. I don't like this. Meghna, no excuses. Finish your food or no phone today. Granny, I don't want to eat this. Don't force her if she doesn't like it. Mum, you don't know her tantrums. Meghna. Eat. She is right. I wonder how you eat this food. I don't like it at all. Mom, that's the kind of cook you get in Mumbai. What to do? Manage work or home. You know home-making is a job. We've grown used to this. You will too. But why settle for this? I am here now. I can cook-- Meghna, I am looking at you. -What were you saying, mom? -Sorry, that was from the office. So... what's up? Granny is going to cook from tomorrow, and Seema is fired. Not at all. What's wrong, mom? That's what I am saying, mom. That's what I am saying, mom. We invited you to Mumbai so you can finally enjoy your life. Well, I sit idle at home all day. I like cooking. So I will cook. Big deal. -Mom... -And you two are always busy. So what? You can go sightseeing. Explore the city. There are several amenities in the building as well. Like a garden, club, there's a library. In fact, there is an old-- I am sorry. There is an activity club. You should attend that. You will like it. As long as my hands and feet are intact, I can cook easily. Meghna, take that roti back, or I will make you eat one more. Let her eat, okay. You are always so daunting. Leave it. Mahesh, she is becoming very undisciplined. -Please don't interfere. -Mom, you should try this 'Paneer'. It's Seema's speciality. This is so oily. It's been four years, Ashutoshji, since your wife Suman passed away. You should make a place for a new picture. This photo belongs right here, Sanjay. -At least think of Pihu-- -I have a reservation at the hotel, please. Excuse me. Sorry, ma'am. Welcome to the Blue Blossom International Hotel. How may I help you? I have a reservation at the hotel under the name of Ramona Singh, please. Sure, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, your suite is ready. I would just need your ID. Thank you. And in case there is a guest with you, And in case there is a guest with you, I will need their ID as well. I am all alone. Sure, ma'am. Is there a problem with that? Does your hotel have a policy, that a single lady cannot stay in the room? I am so sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean that. And it's definitely not that way. I should hope not. Because, whether I stay here alone or with someone, it's really nobody's business. You're absolutely right, ma'am. Can I have my key, please? Just a second, ma'am. Thank you. I'm... really sorry. I didn't mean that. Sanjay... Hi. I have a booking. Good evening, sir. Welcome to the Blue Blossom Hotel. Ashutosh, please have some. Please. Please. I cannot finish the entire thing. Don't doubt yourself at all, Sanjay, You can eat another sandwich after this one. Are you going to find out Ramola madam's entire history? At 30 she started her own soft drinks and soda business. And now she is successfully running the company. "What inspires me the most is creating impact," "and making a difference through innovation and entrepreneurship." It's not an ordinary feat, Sanjay. Rich people must have an exceptional life. Not like us. Why? What's wrong with our lives? At least they don't get displaced from their own house. Did you start looking for a house? Suman, Pihu and I spent some quality time together in that house. Suman, Pihu and I spent some quality time together in that house. Won't be easy, Sanjay. Ashutosh. Memories are like a cage. Do you get it? Once you come out of that house, you'll come out of the cage. And the builder will stop at nothing. Shouldn't you have informed me first? My mom's visiting us. Stop shouting. Everyone's sleeping. No, okay fine... Do as you wish. No, okay fine... Do as you wish. Even I am having second thoughts now. No. This is not done. Okay. What happened? Seema isn't coming today. She didn't inform me earlier. What's the problem if Seema isn't coming? Mom, please. I don't like my day starting like this. It's 8:30. I haven't had my cup of coffee yet. I'll be late for office. I will make coffee. Silly. Mom... -Mom... -I told you to let me cook. Let's make coffee for you first. Go take a shower. Go take a shower, until then I will ready the coffee. Sugar? Sugar. Wait. Reminds me of my childhood. Remember, how father and I eagerly waited for your 'Pooris' every Sunday. Your father used to wait for the 'Halwa'. That's why he got diabetes. Come on. Come on. -You take the vegetables and I'll get the 'Pooris'. -Okay. Mom, let's have breakfast on the balcony today. Just like we did in Indore. On the terrace. No, it's fine in here. Why? You loved having breakfast under the sun. In Indore I did. But there are weird people here. -Weird people? -Yes. Who? A guy was strolling around in his towel. -Towel. -Yes. Must be a housecoat, mom. Do you know who Subhash Kapoor is? The film director. 'Inteqaam ki Jung, Bulava, etcetera... he's made several of them.' Him? He lives here. He's no big shot right now. His films stopped working, but the director is still going at it. You know how these film personalities are. Poor guy. He is no poor guy. He's a pretty scandalous. There are several rumours about him. He lives here away from his wife and children. He lives here away from his wife and children. Doesn't get along with anyone in society. Mom, you stay away from him. Fine. Go call everyone. Breakfast is getting cold. Meghna. Child. A usual day, usual events. Usual habit, usual fears. I am turning over a new leaf... The feeling of your existence, the chime of your anklets, The new beginning. I am changing. Such is the effect when you pass by. Wonder what may happen, if you stay. With a few moments to spare, say you are beside me. That you are a companion too. Do you feel any of this, Do you feel any of this, Or is it just me turning over a new leaf... You should definitely come and visit if you ever get the chance. -Maybe someday. -Maybe someday. I hope you had a pleasant stay. -Thank you so much. -Please. Please. Thank you. Hello, Ramona ma'am. How are you? Oh hi, Mister... Ashutosh. Aren't you the one who... I am really sorry for that day, ma'am. It's fine. I hope your stay is good. If there is anything you need, please let me know. Actually, there is something I need. Sure. Can you get me a drink? I am really sorry, ma'am, but the bar is closed. I suggest you order from room service. I suggest you order from room service. God, you guys always say "can we get you something", and then tell us to order from room service. It's just not done. I am really sorry, ma'am, but it's not like that. Then what is it like? Sorry. I am just kidding. Actually, I am flying back to Delhi tomorrow. So I had a little... But you are booked with us until day after tomorrow if I am not wrong. Yeah. So I can't check out tomorrow? Absolutely. You are unbelievable. I feel bad for your wife. If you can ask me so many questions, I can imagine her dilemma. Actually, you guys... Sorry. You men have it so easy. Look at us. We spend years giving answers, but the questions never end. but the questions never end. Please. Ramonaji, anything else in this city except for our hotel that you may have liked. I did go sightseeing today. But could have been much more fun if it was less crowded. Ramonaji, Mumbai would lose its charm without the crowd. I guess so. But you must try the ice cream sandwich at S Rustom. -Is it? -Yes. Okay. I will on my next trip here. Great. Goodnight, Mr. KBC. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. See, Ashutosh. These rich people are just like us. They talk to anyone after a few pegs down. Ramonaji was right. Mumbai is pretty crowded now. What is your problem with going to Bandra? But traffic is inevitable. Yes, I've been waiting-- Hello. Come over first and then I'll tell you the destination. Fine. I'll pay cash. Do you have change for 2000? -Hi! -Hi, what sup? I am so sorry. I couldn't think of anyone else who lives in the area. No problem. I am so sorry for calling you like this. Again with the formalities... -What? -What? Nothing. Come... Sorry. -Sorry. Sorry. -You okay? -Sorry. Sorry. -You okay? Yeah. -Let me help you with the door. -I'll do it. So I guess all is okay with you. Yeah, all good. -And you? -Yeah. Great. You never called. But I guess I understand. You didn't call either. How is your mom? She is fine. Still trying to embarrass me. You didn't take my advice yet, did you? I cannot lie. And I don't like liars either. Suit yourself. So these days people go to the gym to build muscles. And biscuits all over their belly. Biscuits... Also called abs. But I say why take the trouble? Only 15 minutes... Try laughing only 15 minutes a day, and you get those six packs. and you get those six packs. Our body... develops several hormones and antibodies... I mean you have no clue... Satpal, why did you stop? Tell us which hormones. How do you give this overdose of fake laughter? Even I want to see this. I was saying... What are you doing among these old folks? You are too early. ...being happy has several benefits. By the way, you belonged on the silver screen. You would have ruled many hearts. Honestly. Raise your hands, everyone. And laugh aloud, okay. See... he ruined his own life first, and now he's taking the help of fake laughter. Hello, excuse me. Subhash sir. Yes. Sitting here is not compulsory. You may leave if you want. You too, Charulataji. Come, let's go. You can come back after 10 years. There is still time. Come on. Bye. They don't know how to treat an artist. Such idiots they are. Look at the view. Can we sit here, Charulataji? No, I am better like this. But I am not. I mean if these distances never shorten, never will I break down in your arms. Do you always misbehave with everyone? No. Only in the first meeting. Then they get used to it. By the way, I've never seen you here before? I arrived here some time ago to stay with my daughter. I arrived here some time ago to stay with my daughter. I see... So our friendship is short-lived. Can't imagine why I listened to you and left? You know something, I can be quite irresistible. Just joking. Do you watch films? Yes. And I've seen a couple of your films too. But I don't watch them anymore. I don't want to. Imagine. You stopped watching films and I stopped making them. You don't make films anymore. What people make these days are not films. It's a joke. And I cannot joke with art. So you didn't abandon films, films abandoned you. And now you are blaming the world for it. I am not furious at all, Charulataji. I've been so polite to you for so long. You've been showing hostility. Well... actually... actually... After my husband, Pritamji passed away, I was pretty lonely. And since I lived all by myself in Indore, maybe... I forgot how to behave around people. Pritamji, huh. Nice name. Did he love you at all, or did you have to make amends? Well, enough personal questions. The interesting part here is, you came here to get rid of your loneliness, midst people who are already lonely. See you then. My granddaughter will be arriving any minute. Of course. We'll be meeting often now. I mean... see you soon. Hi. Come. Keep it here. Sunita will take these. Sunita, please. Sorry. Keep the juice in the fridge. Come, sit. Where? Sorry. Sit. Here. Beautiful view. Yeah, I love it too. By the way, you were right. You can't take care of your home. Shut up. I know I still haven't unpacked completely. -But I will do it over the days. -Thank you. Did you find a job? Not yet, it's been a little difficult. Oh right, of course. What 'of course'? Don't pregnant women work? No-- And why do you look so pale since you saw my belly? Nonsense. I am normal. I mean I was acknowledging, it is difficult. So... your husband/partner whatever... Where is he? So sorry. I didn't mean to-- -It's none of my business. -No, no, chill. It's okay. He's actually the reason why I left the US. We used to work together. Everything was going smoothly, but... once he got promoted, things changed. He suddenly became controlling, as if someone made him the boss in our relationship. To be honest, I deserved that promotion. And having another boss at home, no thanks. I can't carry such heavy baggage. -And cabs are difficult to get. -But flights aren't. So I took a flight to India. The day we met, that was the day I found out I was pregnant. So due to stress and heat... Anyway, I guess it is what it is. Once I find a job, everything will be sorted? What? I worked at one of the biggest sustainable architecture firms in the US. I've six years of experience on my resume. If someone bothers to read it. I wasn't doubting you. You are doubting me with that look. What are you doing by the way? I... Sorry. I cannot see things in disarray, so I thought-- Don't judge me. I am pregnant and managing everything alone. -Help... -Did you see that? That console. Made from reclaimed wood. Nice, nah. Also, I want to add some indoor plants. Actually, I've several things to do. Ma'am, this is Mumbai. Landlords don't let you do anything. I own the house. Actually, my father owned it. But he never got used to the place. Then a makeover is inevitable. If I get some time to breathe. Ex? Does he know? No. And I don't even feel the need to tell him. We weren't married so I don't have to tell him. We were living-in together, and we broke up. And I am fine. Thank you. -Sunita, get some snacks. -Please, no. -No need for formality-- -I am hungry. Sorry. Please get something. Two watches. This is for my notification and work. And this one belongs to my mother. It's always been with me. I keep it since it still works. Look at me Why follow time? Live on your own terms. These things sound nice in theory. Live freely and all. Well... you have your mom's watch. What about your dad? No peace at night either. Pihu. Pihu. How is it? How is it? Am I looking nice? Mama's makeup kit was getting spoilt. And I thought why don't I use it. So Pihu wants to be like mom. No. I was just missing her. And I was just going through her stuff. Did you finish packing? You must be a little scared. Scared about what? I am going to boarding school, not jail. Pihu, Panchgani is nothing like Mumbai. I know, father. Mumbai is swarming with people. But they are all selfish. Selfish! Good God. Pihu is a grownup now. Do you know, Pihu, next time when you come for your holidays, we may not have this place anymore. You mean we're getting a new place. Something bigger and better? Why not? Yes. And for that I want you to go to Panchgani and study hard. And become successful in life. Successful enough that... one day, your picture is on the cover of a magazine. And the caption will read "The next big thing". And then I will take you on a world tour. -Promise? -Yes. What did you do all day? Watched the view from here. It's so beautiful from up here... It's so gorgeous... -So you didn't step out of the house? -So pretty, grandma. -So you didn't step out of the house? -So pretty, grandma. Aah... is this grandma? Yes. -Thank you. -Show me. But Meghna looks prettier. Isn't this from before my birth? Just one year after my wedding. Papa was a lucky man. You looked so gorgeous. Now go get changed. Don't come to the dining table in these formals. Yes, mom. -And tell Seema to serve dinner. -Yes You also want to change pretty girl. But you look nice anyway. -Thank you. -Okay, go. Go with mama. Grandma said you are cute. Are you cute? Are you cute? Nice? How is the activity club coming along, mom? People here are different. I met the director today. Subash uncle? He is a very peculiar man. But he is a lot of fun. He always has an fascinating story to tell. Oh hello. Don't talk nonsense. Mom, I told you to stay away from that man. God knows what goes on in that mind of his. Mom, tell us what you felt about uncle Subhash. He is weird. Weird. He is actually eccentric. In fact, he sends his house help Alok to the society meetings. What's the line he uses? "Artists don't have time for everyday affairs." I think he really enjoys troubling the other members. Yes. It's exactly what he did today. I see. But if Meenu doesn't like it, I will stay away from him. Meenu doesn't like me either. -Sometimes you don't like me, Meenu. -Shut up. You have to agree. What is your papa saying? It's Bellagio. What's the matter, Sanjay? Is everyone having an off day at Blue Blossom today? Is everyone having an off day at Blue Blossom today? The room branch of our hotel is celebrating its golden jubilee. So these fliers have to be kept on the front desk, and distributed amongst guests. And the winner gets a trip to Rome. Four days three nights stay at Blue Blossom Hotel, Rome. Wow! But I doubt anyone will win this contest. Look at these questions? Never heard of them before. See here. "Bellagio is one of the most beautiful towns in Italy," "is located on which lake?" Does anyone know? Must be Powai Lake. That's all I know. Lake Como. -What? -Lake Como. Splendid. What about this one? In which Italian museum can one find Micheal Angelo's only surviving Hazel painting. In Florence. Uffizi Gallery. You know this too? Have you been to Italy, Ashutosh? Ashutosh has been around the world from where he's seated. Ashutosh has been around the world from where he's seated. Right. It's just a hobby, Sanjay, nothing more. So I keep reading about them. And I also keep talking to the guests. Ashutosh, employees can take part too. You should fill out the form as well. Maybe you can win. Oh, please. How can I go? And all by myself... What is the problem? Don't people travel alone in the world? Manik sir. The guest in 205 is calling. Again. I just took a break. Didn't even finish my tea yet. Check what he wants. He wants to speak to someone senior. God, these people won't let me catch my breath. Finish your tea, Manik. I'll deal with it. -Thanks. -It's okay. And anyway, Manik is not used to hard work. Anything you need, please let me know. -Sure. -Good day. sir. Thank you. Ramonaji. Welcome back. Sorry, I seem to be trying the wrong room. Any problem, ma'am? My key card doesn't seem to be working. No worries. May I, please? Sure. Just a second. The system needs a reset. -Just a minute please. -Sure. By the way, ma'am, I am really sorry for that day. I unnecessarily asked you too many questions. No apologies. Actually, I was just joking with you, and maybe I overdid it. Let me try my card, ma'am. Let me try my card, ma'am. Please. Thank you. Thank you... Ashutoshji. But you can call me Mr. KBC also, ma'am. Sorry, I just feel so stupid. -Sorry. -No ma'am. I will make it up to you. But right now can I get my key card back? Ma'am, I think there is something wrong with the card? It's not working. I suggest you keep my master key. I'll quickly send someone with the replacement. -Are you sure? -Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you. No worries, ma'am. Ma'am... I just wanted to take this opportunity to say, I really admire your personality. I have a daughter. I hope she grows up to be like you. That's very kind of you, Ashutoshji. Thank you. No worries. My pleasure. Good day, ma'am. -Hi. -Hi. Let me guess. Another rejection? Why do you think I am here? If I had gone home, I wouldn't have heard the end of it. And what makes you think I won't. Listen, I am serious. How long will this continue? You'll get fired with so much distraction. The place bores me. And the company won't sink without me. Come on. You got to keep it together until you find a rich wife. Some tea? Got ginger? Good afternoon, beautiful. You here? Well, Charu, I love drinking tea. And with a company like this, is like the cherry on the icing. What? Yes. This is what I meant. Your grace, your simplicity... It's just unique. Say that again. "What?" I've already had my cup of tea. Go find another company. I am in no mood for tea. No mood for tea? How is that possible? I am closing the door. Move your hands or they will get trapped in the door. I am already trapped... Siya. What happened? -Nothing, just a little-- -Wait... Not with that. Thank God. Sunita would be yelling at me. Who keeps milk in this vessel? Let that Sunita come. Listen, please don't scare her away. Otherwise, who will feed me? Hire me. I am completely trained. Hire me. I am completely trained. Are you giving an interview here as well? Nice. Okay. I will consider it. Don't worry, you are safe with me. Why don't you-- Yes? Sir sent this for you. Bye. Hello. Hello. Charu, I had made up my mind, about sharing a cup of tea with you. You are incorrigible, Subhashji. It's a good thing Meenu and Mahesh are not at home. They couldn't have stopped us either. You worry about everyone except for me. I do feel slightly jealous of Pritamji. He must share tea with you every day. What's the point of getting jealous anyway? Your company is pretty invaluable to me. Of all the people in this society, you had to pick me? This place is filled with jokers. You do not want to strike a conversation. Most families have only one breadwinner. And usually, it's the guy. And you are looking for exactly the opposite. It would sound weird to anyone. This blasted society and its rules! Does it seem weird to you too? No. As a kid, I saw my father do all the household chores. And you know, he had a job too. You never talk about him. How was he? He was an ordinary human being. Lived an ordinary life and died. Don't you miss him? It's been four years, Piyush. You have to find a way to move on. But you know, I realised growing up, that we both were very different people. He lived in the past, and I in the future. And me in the present. And I think in the present we should take a seat. Do you tire so quickly? -Grow some stamina. -I am pregnant. -Careful. -I am fine, thanks. Thank you. Ma'am. Done? Your sustainable makeover. Is it so obvious? Actually, I've always been a workaholic. I thought I'll take a two-month break. Fly back to the US and find a job again. Clearly, life had other plans. Can I ask you a personal question? Did you ever think of, you know... Not having the baby? No. After mom passed away, papa was a single parent too. And if he could do it, I can certainly do it better. Give me some of the responsibilities. Give me some of the responsibilities. -We can do it even better. -I see. "All the paths I had taken were never easy." "But you make this city feel familiar." "Everywhere I look I see glimpses of you." "With you every day feels like a dream." "let the city converge at your feet." "overwhelmed by your colours of love." "dedicating all it's narratives to you." "This city is now crazy about you." "This city is now crazy about you." "Innocent love." "Innocent love." "Innocent love." "Innocent love." "Innocent love." Yes, papa. Tell me. What do you mean? This isn't right, Pihu. I've been waiting for you to call. Well, one of the girls at the hostel threw a birthday party. Leave that, papa. Was it something important? No, nothing important. I just wanted to ask how you are. Papa, how long will you keep waiting for my phone calls? I... I-- Papa, my friends are calling me. I have to go. Okay, okay. Go and enjoy. Papa, did you finalise a house or not? Yes, child. I did. I saw two places that are-- Pihu? Hello, Pihu? Hello, Ramonaji. Do you wanna have some ice cream? Hello, Ramonaji, do you remember that famous ice cream stall? [indistinct chatter] Sir. Very good. Very good. Go through the entire thing first. It's very good, Roshni. Just change the last two slides. -Okay. -Good work. Hi. You tell me, what's up? Nothing. Just wanted to ask what Sunita is doing? You lectured her about slow and high flame. So she's pissed off. Did the plumber show up? Shit, I completely forgot. Piyush, he is still in the bathroom. Then why are you not with him? He will make a mess of the bathroom, Siya. Calm down, Piyush. I will handle it. Calm down, Piyush. I will handle it. I can see that. If you are getting so paranoid, then you come down here. Okay, I am hanging up. I am expecting an email. I am very stressed. Siya, listen. Stress is harmful to the child. He's my child. Stress will be the default for him. I hope this kid brings me some luck, Piyush. Because mine has expired. Wow. So you will give him stress, and he will bring you good luck. Moms are not so selfish, Ms Siya. You are more than welcome to be a selfless mother. One sec. Oh my, God. Piyush! -Oh my, God. Piyush! -Hello. Siya. I got the job. I freakin' got the job. I am a project lead. Oh my, God. Congratulations. That's amazing. What company is it? We have to warn them in advance. Shut up. Okay, bye. Charuji. I am sorry I was changing. And that idiot Alok is fast asleep. Won't you come in? Since you've been insisting for the past couple of days, I decided to-- This way. Sit. Doesn't this wall look empty? Do you feel the same way? I said this to Alok. I was thinking of, putting up a huge painting of my next film's heroine. Why the heroine? Put up your own picture. Since you are all over the place. Sorry. By the way, who is the heroine of your next film? Do you want to see it? She is my next heroine. I thought you are really making a film. I will make a film, Charuji. It's just taking some time. Finally, you're up. See. This idiot sleeps more than me. It's hard to sleep longer at your age. What? My age. Wise guy? Get lost. See... This is the current generation. No manners. This is what they show in films now. When I make my film, several people will go out of business. See for yourself. What are they making in the name of youth content? Trash. They prepare a story in one day, shoot in two days, and release it on the fifth day. and release it on the fifth day. And what are these stories all about? True love comes to an end in one day. Half the world is carrying guns and swords. And what's it called... number... -Item number. -Item number. No depth. No ideology. You seem worried. Is something wrong? No. It's nothing serious. Tell me. Anything wrong? Chetan, my son called. He said my story wasn't approved, because it doesn't have the X-factor. What the hell is this X-factor? And our company is going through rough times. He was saying, we'll have to sell this house to make the film. But there is nothing wrong with it. You can use the money to make your film. Are you serious? Sell the place. As long as I ran the show, I was in control, As long as I ran the show, I was in control, it never came to this. These people want to keep me away from filmmaking, which is my love and passion. So... what have you decided? What's there to decide? He may be running the company, but I am still his father. I'll play something for you. I... composed this. You? Are you a musician too? Absolutely. Come. May I? Please. Come on. "I see you still standing there," "down my memory lane." "down my memory lane." "Cheating on my dreams," "and in my reality." "Covered in a silhouette." "You claim this is just a mask." "Just a mask... " "Each layer has a mark of your soul." "Yes, a mark." "Yes... it's you." "Someplace beyond this reality, where you exist, and you don't." "Someplace beyond this reality, where you exist, and you don't." "where you exist, and you don't." "Keeping the soul intact," "is one of your weird hobbies." "Gleaming in my sad eyes," "are your fake smiles." "Take a look... " "You are a mystery, you are the solution." "The solution." "The solution." "Yes... it's you." "Someplace beyond this reality, where you exist, and you don't." Ashutoshji. Come with me. Sanjay, I am done for the day. If it's anything you want, say it here. Come with me, please. Someone is calling you. -Me? -Yes. But I am not in uniform. Who is it? Fine. Just come with me. Come on. -Who-- -Just come with me. Come on. -Ashutoshji. -Hello, Ramonaji. Actually, I need your help. Ma'am, my shift just got over. My colleague Mr. Sanjay can help you... No, I need to speak with you. Sure. I never imagined mango ice cream could be so yum (tasty). Ice creams can never be bad. It's true. Have you ever tried Gelato? It's really famous in Italy. You must have been around the world. I am sure there's still some time before it's introduced in India. Gelato is amazing, Ashutoshji. You must try when you- How can I? Why? Why not? You told me about that competition the other day. You remember. Yeah. We middle-class people are not that lucky, to bag the jackpot. But it's not too bad either. I got an opportunity to share this ice cream with an accomplished person like you. Were your friends too busy today to join you? Were your friends too busy today to join you? Okay. There you go again. By the way, what friends are you talking about? Well... those who live in this city. I mean... how did you think of me today? You gave me this idea about the ice cream here. And there are rare moments in my life, when I can just go out and do what I want. You don't have to take the trouble for things like these. That's the misconception, Ashutoshji. The things a single lady has to do to run her business. No, I... No, I... I can imagine. Must be tough. Employees and colleagues doubt you. Media wants to get into your private life. As for family and friends-- I don't know. They feel just because you are rich and famous, everything is easy. But the truth is... we still have to struggle. So do failure and... heartbreak. But... we must keep showing our face, with confidence. Can't cry me to sleep at night now, can I? Trust me. You're doing a fine job at it. It's rightly said, Ashutoshji. It can be lonely at the top. Anyway... ask your next questions? Next question? Come on, ma'am. Ma'am? It's just Ramona. Ma'am makes my grey hair stand. Don't stroll down my deserted lanes... For I'll get used to your independent laughter. Don't linger at the end of every verse. My words will fall in love with you. Commotion is all I've ever known. Don't take that away from me. My heart will be blessed with tranquillity. What are you thinking? Nothing. How long will all this continue? Until you don't tell Siya about your feelings. Siya? What? How did she get into all this? You spend all your time with her. And meet girls on weekends for my sake. What do you think? I don't understand. It's not that way, mom-- Fine. None of this from next week, okay. Maybe I misjudged you. You want someone who doesn't just love you, but also respects your choices. You never respected them. You never respected them. Shut up. But don't take too long to tell her. She is the right girl. Siya. Siya. Wake up. Wake up. We're in a meeting. -Soon... -Am I late? No, no, you are not. -Coffee? -Thank you. Listen, I must discuss something important with you. Why did you bring me this coffee-flavoured water? That's all the caffeine pregnant women are allowed. Hear me out. Thank you. Just pass me my laptop. Here. Thank you. So... What are you doing? My meeting starts in two minutes. So we have two minutes. So we have two minutes. Piyush, this better be an emergency. Tell me. I resigned. As in? You're moving to another company? Maybe? Maybe not? I don't understand. Don't you want a job? I will get one, Siya. I mean not right now. There should be a choice, right? Yeah, sure. But you cannot take impractical decisions in the name of choice. When did you even decide this? I'll tell you everything. Finish your call. We will talk after that. I just wanted to let you know. You are so weird. This is big news and you want me to get on with the call. Anyway, you better stop dreaming about getting married. You will never find anyone without a job. Not even you? What do you mean? I mean I want to be with you. Okay. Piyush, you know I'm in no mood to get married-- Siya, I want to be with you. We don't need these name tags for it. And I am not afraid of being alone. It's... I just like being with you. Why are you saying this now? I don't know. It just feels right. You. Me. Us. You are right. Maybe I should have said it earlier. But Siya, I couldn't muster the courage. And the way you understand me, No one does. And you are a workaholic, ambitious, and I am exactly the opposite. It's a match made in heaven. But could be a disaster on earth, Piyush. I mean... you know my situation. I mean... you know my situation. This is just... Did you think of my state of mind before coming and saying all of this? Or did you just show up abruptly... I've been doing this for the past couple of months. And I thought of asking you directly. Was I wrong? Siya, listen. We don't need to rush this. I know right now it's too overwhelming with everything. The situation. You take your time. And see how you feel. Look... the point is I can manage without you. But when you are around, everything seems better. And I can't deny that. So I am here. Always. Please, before everything speak to him. And say what? This is his child too, Siya. No matter what happened between you two, he deserves to know. I'll think about it. I have to get back to my meeting now. Okay, I'll just say now... Piyush... Your timing, I tell you... Hi. Can I say something if you don't mind? I don't have a mind, why will I mind? How can you drink this black tea every day? I have had enough. Tomorrow I'll make tea for you, which everyone likes. Everyone likes? But whose tea do you prefer? All your life you made tea for everyone, but don't know what you prefer. That's not true. I have no preferences. Bravo, Indian woman. Always concerned about everyone's preferences, but personally you have no preferences at all. Anyway... look at me. My family doesn't understand me. Instead of wasting my energy on them, I built this beautiful world for myself. And also looking for a producer for my next film. Charuji, never in your life did you feel, that you should live for yourself once. Just once. I am sure you did. You are so beautiful. I am sure you were presented with opportunities. But you thought about others, and not yourself. Charu... Life always gives a second chance. And we get to decide whether we take it or not. And we get to decide whether we take it or not. There was one such chance in my life, but feels more like an accident now. There's just me, and all your secrets are safe with me. Believe me. This happened nearly 20 years ago. I went to Europe with Pritamji to celebrate my birthday. I was waiting for him at the hotel, and he was nowhere to be found. And when he came back, he was empty-handed. I got very angry. And I told him everything I'd been wanting to tell him for a long time. And stormed out of the hotel in whichever direction my mind took me. Amazing. Sounds like a scene from an amazing European film. Sounds like a scene from an amazing European film. What happened next? I sat down in a cafe. Thought of spending some time alone. The waiter came along and said "madam, order". And I just froze. I realised that I have no identity without Pritamji. Didn't feel nice. I was about to leave the cafe when, I bumped into a stranger. We were the only Indians in that cafe. I don't know what happened next, but I poured my heart out to him. Seemed like that stranger was in the cafe to hear me out. So that night you felt a connection with that stranger. So that night you felt a connection with that stranger. I don't know. When you look at your troubles from another point of view, you feel lighter. You feel better. But you have to face it alone. And then? Then what? Nothing. I returned to my life. I got over him, but he couldn't get over me. He would send a poem on my every birthday. Every year? Now that's the mark of a true lover. By the way, did you ever try to meet him? Strange. I understand you must have several admirers, but this gentleman was worth the effort. Maybe... Maybe... But all this has no meaning now. It's exciting to follow your heart, but we cannot forget the reality. The sun gives you light as long as it's in the sky. Darkness prevails after it sets. But when it sets here, it's giving light somewhere else. Isn't that right? Can I ask you a question? What did you tell your family about our friendship? They doubt me... -But-- -You do what your heart tells you to. Right? So the sun hasn't set yet. See you then. Time for Meghna to return. Listen. Did Mr. poet send one of his creations on this birthday too? So when are you reading it out to me? If the mirror's a little hazy, you can borrow my sights. Leaning over my shoulder, you can divulge all your desires. If it's so uncomfortable, then why wear it? -Shut up. -Your order, ma'am. Thank you. You wanted to go in a formal date. Otherwise, we could have ordered at home. And miss watching you struggle in this dress? Siya, did you talk to Raghav? Is this why we are here? No, I mean... Actually, I've been meaning to... Actually, I've been meaning to... In fact, I have... Look, Siya, regardless of what type of a guy he is, we are right. There is no wrong or right, Piyush. Hey... Hi, Siya. What are you-- He was calling you repeatedly, so I just thought-- Piyush, why did you pick it up without asking me first? This is really not done. Not done? And what you are doing? And why talk to him? Talk to me. I am here now. So go back the way you came here. Siya, let's just talk calmly. You need to talk this out. If you want to talk then talk, okay. More than welcome. -I am not interested. -Siya, please don't... That's the only solution you have for everything. Run away from the situation. Such important news, and you didn't feel like telling me once? No. No. -Siya, please just-- -Do you have a problem? Nope. Just a bit surprised you haven't changed in all these months. You only think about yourself. Yes. I am selfish. I think about myself. How many times are you going to say this, Raghav? Siya, please sit down. Please. Okay, you want to talk? Let's talk. Sit. Let's talk. Yeah. Tell me. Look, Siya. I didn't know you are pregnant. -As soon as I found out-- -You came down to assert your right. Raghav, let me remind you... This is my child. Only mine. Just like I deserved that promotion. God's sake, Siya. don't start with this. As long as you were getting promoted, you liked the job and the company. When I started getting promoted, started doing well, you started having problems. With me, the company, everyone. You realise you always do this. No one should exceed you. You know, that's why you don't have people in your life. You always want to be superior. And unfortunately, that doesn't work in a relationship. Isn't that why you broke up with me? Call for the check, Piyush. Wait a second. You two-- Piyush, please. This is more complicated than you think... Yes, complicated because it's true. You broke up with me because you couldn't take me to be more successful. Is this the truth, Siya? Yeah, I am done here. Siya. Siya. Siya, please stop crying. Should have thought about that before calling him here. If I hadn't called him here, I would have believed this lie for the rest of my life. What? Nothing. No, say it. -Nothing, Siya. -Say it. Let's talk later, Siya. Even you think I am selfish. -I only think about myself. -Did I say that? -I only think about myself. -Did I say that? You feel that way. You've been doing favours to me all these months. Excuse me? What favours, Siya? Mom is right. When we don't respect ourselves, others stop respecting you. Excuse me. Let me remind you, Piyush. You wanted to be involved in my life. You proposed to me. My life was going smoothly without you. Yes, and it would have continued smoothly. Because everyone is dispensable to you. You can continue living smoothly without anyone. You know what, I have realised something. If someone decides to stay with you, then he must compete with you. And he must lose to you. You are not even worthy of competing. You wanted my company, because all the girls in the world had already rejected you. Ashutoshji, you have only two days. What for? Your special guest is back. But only for two days. Have you thought of what you are going to say? Last time you had ice cream in your mouth. What is there to say? I don't have time for all this. I am busy. Hurry up. Ashutoshji. It's now or never. Don't, Pihu. Please. Don't, Pihu. Please. At work it;s Sanjay and here it's you. Sanjay uncle is absolutely right. It's now or never. I made a big mistake telling you two. Even you are making a mistake, papa, by not giving yourself a second chance. I know mama was your best friend. But she is no longer here. Papa. You must move on. Does a peaceful place like this exists in this crowded city? Pretty amazing. You wouldn't have come here on your own. So I thought of inviting you. That's true. Maybe... I will never come to Mumbai again. I am just done. Actually, I... wanted to tell you something. I... wanted to tell you something. I... I've grown so old, I also have a daughter. But I am still scared like a little child. This... is Suman. My wife. She died four years ago. She was my best friend. I am sorry, Ashutoshji. I didn't realise... As you guessed earlier, maybe Suman was tired of my questions. That's why she left me. After Suman died, I thought maybe no one can fill the void. But then I realised I should give myself a second chance. And I... I felt this way when I... When I met you. I know I... You... Ashutoshji... just give me a second. -Just hear me out, okay. -Yes. We are good friends. And you have done a lot for me. But I never thought of you that way. But I never thought of you that way. That's alright, I am not in a hurry, -and-- -No, that's not it. I can... I can never think of you that way. Remember the other day when I was standing outside my room, and you opened that door with your master key. So... that was actually my partner's room. And... I was trying to enter it. I accidentally tried to use my key. Bhargavi. My partner. We meet here in the hotel. Ma'am, I understand. I am not a fool. We are no match. But for that, you don't have to lie. Lie? Ashutoshji, this is the truth. Maybe we'll spend our lives meeting at hotels. I can't change it. If that's the truth, then no need to keep it closed behind hotel doors. The world is not a convenient place for people like us, Ashutoshji. When two people decide to spend their entire life together, then nothing can be convenient. Not for a 45-something guy to share his feelings with you. Nor for an independent/successful lady like you to hold hands in front of the entire world. No, I understand. No, so... I've added the PPT. No, I have. Just have a look. Okay, sure. Give me until tonight. There will be no delays. So, the thing is, I had informed them about this. I had a situation at home, and I couldn't get out of it. I had a situation at home, and I couldn't get out of it. So... It's a deadline, Ritika. Sorry, Ritika, just give me a second. You eat it. Isn't brother Piyush coming? Yes, sorry. Done. Done. It'll be done for sure. And I am going to mark every one. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Thank you so much for understanding. Do you have some money? Who was that? That was my husband. Here to ask for money? Does he do any work? Why were you giving him money? Sister, he is looking for a job. He did have a job as a driver. But his boss fled from Mumbai. Now... he works as a cat feeder. We don't get to pick and choose. What to do? Well... I run the house now. No, that's a good thing. You are the boss at home. But careful. Or you will have to shoulder all the responsibilities. Isn't it? But, sister, how does it matter? It's our house. So we both contribute in any way we can. And this is not a race where defeating him will make me happy. It's alright. 'Poha' is really nice. -Really? -Yes. Brother Piyush taught me. I don't know how to make all this. Then make what you like. Take it away. -But you just said you are hungry. -No, I am not hungry. Hi. What are you doing here, Raghav? Can I come inside? I am leaving. Come on time tomorrow. What the hell do you want, Raghav? Look, Siya. All I am saying this is my child too. Yeah, but you're not carrying it in your belly, right. -Right, but that doesn't change-- -What? You want custody of the child? -Is that why you are here? -No, Siya, I don't want, custody of the child. Why do you get so insecure over everything? I am not here to take you away, or take the child away from you. Keeping the child was my decision alone. I do not need you to bring up my child. Of course, you do not need me. You need someone you can feel superior to. Isn't that why you went for Piyush? Excuse me. Don't drag him into this. You just... You met him only once. Yes, Siya, and all my questions were answered. Listen, Siya. Whether you like it or not, I am the father of this child. And I just want to be acknowledged as that. I am not asking for anything unfair. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind, can I go ahead? -I'll move to the next counter. -Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Hello, Ramonaji. -Hi. -Hi. How may I help you? I don't have a booking today, Ashutoshji. I don't have a booking today, Ashutoshji. Actually, I am permanently shifting to Mumbai. That's good news. Ashutoshji, can you show me the previous bookings? Sure, ma'am, but-- Please, it won't take that long. Sure. Check who was in the room next to mine. Certainly. That's... Mr. Rajiv Patel. And before that? Sure ma'am. Mr. Patel again. One minute, Ashutoshji. Hello, Ashutoshji. Hi. Actually, Rajiv Patel is Bhargavi's brother. What? -Hi. -Hi. Actually, only he knew about us, so normally he would make hotel reservations. You know, I thought, it would put my reputation at risk. But after what you said the other day, I felt why don't I show some courage as well. I mean, how long will I keep postponing my own happiness? I am actually... Whatever I said to you the other day, Ramona. I know... it wasn't required. -I am really sorry. -No, Ashutoshji. If you hadn't said all those things, then our relationship wouldn't have got a second chance. And maybe I would have never moved to Mumbai. So thank you for that. I must say you look exceptionally happy today. At least one of us doesn't have to be lonely anymore. At least one of us doesn't have to be lonely anymore. What have you decided now, Ashutoshji? I mean what's next for you? For me it's... Gelato. Gelato? I won the lottery, Ramonaji. You're going to Italy, Ashutoshji? That's amazing. What are you doing here? Subhashji. I... I had an important question to ask. Hurry up. Did Mr. Poet's explanations, bring any change to your relationship with Pritam ji? bring any change to your relationship with Pritam ji? What? I mean how was life after that. Same as always. I see... Do you have his address? Address? Yes. His home address. He lives somewhere here in Mumbai. Here in Mumbai-- Here in Mumbai. You are unbelievable, Charuji. A man loved you so much, and you were sharing a cup of tea with me all these days. So what? There was nothing between us. Charuji. The world wants to separate us from our dreams. And we shouldn't let that happen. Get changed and meet me downstairs. I am waiting for you in the parking. Parking. We are going to see Mr. Poet. We are not going anywhere. Everyone's at home. Leave. Go. I am waiting for you in the parking. And yes, bring all his poems along. And yes, bring all his poems along. Such a stubborn man. -How can I leave so suddenly-- -Who was it, mother? You are awake early today. I have a presentation. Who was it? He was at the wrong flat? I will go finish my prayers. See, Alok. What did I tell you? You are great, sir. Charuji, just a few moments. Then it will be just you and Mr. Poet. Then it will be just you and Mr. Poet. I don't know why I am going? I have lost my mind. You are unbelievable. You are going to do what you should have done a long time ago. How could I just-- Charuji, if you want to keep up with society, then you must make impulsive decisions. Behaving your age is not being orthodox. Just imagine how glad Mr. Poet will be to see you. Isn't it? Isn't it? Well, I am very excited. I've dedicated a part of my destiny to you, And adorned every corner of my room with your silence. I have no complaints, filled my pen with hopes. You can keep those thresholds, I have befriended the anticipation. Is this Ashutosh Rane's house? Yes. Who are you? May I? Yeah, please. These are post-dated. What is the matter? Papa gave me this box four years ago. And said Pihu you must post these letters every year on 4th June. Don't forget. Since it was his last wish, I didn't ask any more questions. Ohh... You mean to say he's... Yes. I am sorry. I am so sorry, aunty. I... I didn't know. Maybe I never understood what papa was doing? I thought it was madness. You know someone is never coming back, and you still keep trying. How can you make place for someone else in life? Guess he was stuck in a different time. You are right, dear. You can't make place for someone else but, some people cannot be replaced. There are certain people who, make a place in your heart in a single meeting. I wish I could have understood him then. Aunty, you... can keep this box. Maybe these letters will help you feel closer to him. I could never spend time with him. Aunty, if you don't mind me asking. How did papa and you meet? Child, do you remember your papa travelled abroad? Yes, he won a competition and through that he... Yes, he won a competition and through that he... Rome. Yeah. That's where they met. It's a very interesting story. You must hear it. Charuji. Please tell her that story. Oh my, God. Her water broke. Piyush isn't picking up the phone. He is an idiot. Anyone else we can call? Raghav. Who is Raghav? The father. -What name did she say? -Raghav. Hi. How are you feeling? Are you okay? Raghav. He is beautiful. As I am. Piyush. Get some rest. You are probably still drowsy from the medicines. Where is Piyush? Where is Piyush? Subhash sir. I am a big fan, sir. Selfie, please. -Should I stand up? -No, sir. Please, keep seated. -Thank you, sir. -Welcome. A big thank you from me too, Subhashji. What thank you, Charuji? Mr. Poet took an early exit. I know but, for the first time I feel, I did something for myself. Seems nice. You are right. Life does give a second chance, but it's important to grab it on time. Absolutely. Otherwise, the sun actually sets on your life. By the way, Charuji, I missed my second chance. Charuji, I was thinking, if I can't make content for the youth, at least I can watch it. Would you come with me... Movie? Yes, movie. She has called 50 times since morning. Yes, dear. I am with Subhashji. I'll be home in a while. Don't worry. Yes. No, I'll manage on my own. Okay. Okay. Bye. She forgets that... That... I am a mother. I am a mother. But I am something else too. You are much more. But if you don't forget that, they won't either. Correct. If I don't forget it, she won't either. Correct. Then shall we? -Let's go. -Come. Hi. Siya. -Siya Rane. -Yes sir. Thanks, Raghav. For calling. I had. She is taking your name even after being sedated. Go meet her. Listen, did you speak to her after that night? Who can ever talk to Siya once she's made up her mind? Siya is an amazing girl. Siya is an amazing girl. But we aren't compatible. We can't live together even if we want to. We'll keep fighting all the time. So are we. But it's different. Siya is my past, but maybe your present and future too. You have to decide what you want. Baby. -Baby. -Siya. Piyush, where the hell were you? I am so sorry. Last night I had a little extra. New colleagues, you know. You got a new job? Still mad at me? Leave all that, Siya. And just relax. How much more relaxed will I be, Piyush? Can I? Be careful. You okay. Keep your arm under his neck. Baby. It's a strange feeling, isn't it? Hearing his heartbeat against your chest. It's amazing. I told you it will be a boy. Siya. I really needed you. I completely scratched the poor nurse. Well, thank God my arms were spared. I am serious. I really needed you. Why? You could manage on your own. You could manage on your own. How many times are you going to rub it in? Don't selfish people deserve love? Listen... I can't replace you. Okay, fine. I have one condition. No more lying. To yourself and me. Look who is talking? Left your old job without telling me. You got a new job and I have no clue. I applied it out of ego because of you. I got the call back in two days. What for I'm so good? I am sorry, Raghav. What is it now? For whatever happened between us. I guess I am still trying to understand myself. I know I could have dealt with things in a better way. It's okay. Now that we are parents, for Nirvaan we'll have to do a lot. Take care. You too. Here you go. Here. Keep it. Where to, sir? Italy. Where is that? Europe. Business or vacation. They serve a special ice cream. Gelato. So far for ice cream? Maybe along with ice cream life will get a second chance.
