♪ (chatter) (car alarm chirps) Morning. (woman) So, Jessica. Just to be clear... Given the merger, there are now going to be two music programs? For now. Can you reach this hook? You're taller than me. Already decorating for Christmas, huh? My therapist told me to find things to keep my mind off the merger. Something less stressful, like Christmas. Less stressful. Like Christmas. Right. I know you hate it Diana, but just give me this, hang this for me. Oh, I'm feeling better already. Merger's going that badly, huh? Merging an all-girls school with an all-boys school. Are you kidding? There are so many issues to resolve. (wolf whistling) Get your hands off her! Making sure that proper behavior is observed. Having to make sure that the existing facilities are co-educational. (Jessica Gedler) Attention, please. The boys are reminded to please lower the toilet seats after using the washrooms. Hello, boys. You know, even the little things like merging our athletic program. But the thing I hate most of all, eliminating unnecessary... duplication. Okay, now I'm stressed out. (bell ringing) I'm gonna go set up for class. Composers have been arguing for years about what feeling certain keys convey. For example... (loud music begins playing throughout) C major is usually thought of as bright and sunny. But... Composer Hector Berlioz, 1803-1869 called C major serious, deaf, and dull. (chatter) One, two, three, four... B minor is about accepting one's fate. (music continues) It's usually referred to as the key of patience. (chatter) Okay, I can't take this anymore. I'll be back in a minute, just shout quietly amongst yourselves in the meantime. One, two, three, four, one, two... Yeah! One... two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Other side. One, two... ah! Three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Can I talk to you for a minute? Can I talk to you for a minute? I can't hear you. Can I talk to you for a minute?! Okay, okay. I hear you. Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Excellent, I love it. Five minutes I'll be right back. (chatter, laughter) What was that all about? What? That... noise? It's called rhythm, you know? As in, I got... Really? 'Cause I call it pounding, as in, headache. I'm trying to teach a music class right next door. What do you think I'm doing? Well, pounding everything in sight isn't exactly music. It's self-expression. Yeah, well, so are facial tattoos, but I don't think we should be encouraging those. Okay, well, you can't make music without a beat. And if you'll excuse me, I got students waiting. (sighs) Can you... Oh, wow. (chatter) Hi. Sorry about that, sorry. (music resumes) (scoffs) I can't hear myself think. I don't know how I'm supposed to teach music if I can't even teach the basics of rhythm. Well, there are things called textbooks. You can't teach music from a book. Really? What do you think I've been doing? Don't you know either? Oh, very funny. Look, I am just trying to teach my students the fundamentals and history of music, I think that's pretty important. Okay, that's fine. I mean, really-- And all I'm trying to do is teach these kids to find the music within themselves. Enough! It's-- Now, please stop arguing about who is teaching the right way. Just be thankful you've got jobs. Are you trying to tell us something? Nothing specific, no, it's just that we're under budgetary pressures and as usual, the very first things to get trimmed are the arts, and here we are with two music teachers who cannot agree on what to teach. It's just that without-- You have to get through to these kids that they... All I'm saying is that they need to-- have the music within them... It's important for them-- No, this, this is exactly what I mean. Now, look, we all agree that music is a vital part of education, but eventually, I am going to have to face the board, who are gonna sit there behind their ledgers, and they're gonna want proof. I don't know how you prove something like that, I mean... With public support. If you can get the alumni and the parents to protect the program, then you've got a chance at keeping the program alive. We could organize a recital. Again, recitals. The only people who come to recitals are the ones who like the music program already. No. No, we need-- we need a bigger tent. Now, have a look at that. Christmas song contest. That could be interesting. Forget interesting. This is going to be televised. That is the kind of exposure we need. Yeah. Gee, if I may, it just seems like we may be exploiting the students. I'll do it. Good. How about you, Ken? In or out? Kasdan and Cresswell can submit two entries? Well, it says, it says right here, one entry per music program, now, since we have two separate music programs still, I don't see why you both can't enter. You realize, don't you, that eventually, your positions will be merged. The board will have to choose one of you as the sole music director. Well, would winning this contest help? It certainly couldn't hurt. Then I'm in. Me too. Good. Well, then may the best music director win. Give 'em a call. ♪ So, we've got a judge with a musical background. We'll be relying on her opinion, but also the phone and text votes for each competitor. This makes me look pasty. Excuse me? Uh, sorry, I was thinking about something else. Anyhoo, we're looking for teams. So duos are preferred, but we will take a trio. Absolutely not. Oh, we-- we weren't planning on doing a trio. Yeah. What? No, no, no, no. When I said absolutely not, I meant a tie. I was talking about a tie. Right, right, what about a tie? What happens in the case of a tie? The right one makes my eyes pop. I'm sorry, I'm not following. What? Look, it's-- It's very simple. Any Christmas carol, any arrangement. Could be a classic, could be contemporary. Mm-hmm, classic. Contemporary. Like I said, it's your call.

And this, this is a chance to showcase herself, you know, and if she doesn't put the work in, then she's the one who comes across looking bad. Yeah, maybe. Hey. What about Amy Barnes? She didn't audition. Oh, that's too bad. She babysits for me sometimes and she sings when she puts Harry down. She has a beautiful voice. Really? Yeah. I don't think I've ever heard her say anything. I know, she's kind of shy. Well, that could be a problem for a television appearance. I mean, no matter how good her voice is. Yeah, but you know, it could also help bring her out of her shell. Well, with all due respect, I've got bigger things to worry about than bringing Amy out of her shell. Gedler as much as told me that this could mean my job. Wow.

I need a huge favor. Do you think you could possibly substitute as a chaperone for me at the winter formal this Saturday? I agreed to do it, but out of nowhere, Scott proposed this big romantic weekend in the mountains, so. Fun. Yeah. But, I mean, if you're busy, you know. Me? No, no, I've got nothing on. Go have fun with your husband. Ah, okay. Thank you, I promise I'll make it up to you. Oh, don't even sweat it. Like I said, I've got nothing happening Saturday. Okay, well, that's what I kind of fi-- Um... I didn't, actually. It's okay. I was hoping. Well, that's not much better, either. That's fine, no, it's fine. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have presumed. Look, we're friends. You know how my weekends are, it's fine. I do know what your weekends are like. We need to change that. Agreed. But, I guess after the winter formal. Yeah. If you're all right with that. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. (chuckles) (rock music playing) Hello. I was assigned to keep an eye on the parking lot with you. Oh, hi. Oh, I didn't know it was gonna be you. Yeah, I know, I was just a last-minute replacement filling in for Jill. A-ha. (laughs) It's a little early for the winter formal, isn't it? Yeah. Coach Willis doesn't like interfering with basketball practice in the winter, so. Ah, right, of course, I should have known. Everything revolves around sports. Yeah. Why let a silly thing like the seasons mess you up? No. You kids can't be out here. No... hi, hi. It's-- We're-- It's Ken and-- Diana, hi. Diana. Thought you were a couple. (laughing) I guess I better get that laser eye surgery, huh? Yeah. Well, I'm glad to see you two finally getting along. See you inside. Okay. Okay. (sighs) Hmm. They must consider this a pretty important post, getting two people to patrol it like this, huh? Are you kidding? Parking lot of a high school dance? Number-one action spot. Don't you remember? No, I was more likely to be in the band than on the dance floor, to tell you the truth. And our family vehicle was actually a hearse. You're kidding. No, no. My stepdad was a-- Was an undertaker. He didn't see any reason to buy a new vehicle when we had a perfectly good 1972 death master in the garage. (laughs) Well, we had an AMC pacer that was not only the ugliest car ever built, but it was completely glass, so you could see through it. My dad knew exactly what he was doing when he bought that car. I'll bet. (car rocking) Look at this. (knocking) Hey. Come on, guys. You know better than this. Inside. You can't hang out out here. Inside. So you were in a band, huh? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was. You any good? We thought we were, but we really weren't. Oh, you were probably better than you think. We weren't. (both laugh) What'd your parents think about that? Oh, God, my mom hated, hated the idea that I wanted to become a musician. Totally fought me every step of the way. So she was overjoyed when I eventually got my education degree. What about you? You a performer? Um, obligatory piano recitals, that sort of thing, but no real performing. You sure that's not you tickling the ivories to Billy Joel's lesser-known "Turnstiles" album? No, I sort of tend more to a Chopin polonaise. Right, right. Well, you're very good. I've heard you play for your class. Thank you. Yeah. Good enough for a high school class, but not quite good enough to perform. No, don't sell yourself short. I've heard professional keyboardists who aren't half as good as you are. Oh, yeah, but that's pop. That's not as demanding. What, popular music isn't demanding? Uh, no. Not really, not if you want me to be honest. So anyone can do it? Well, no, I mean, but it's, you know, usually three or four chords played over and over again and not really much of a melody. Yeah, but you have to feel it, though. See, that's the difference. You can't hide behind technique. You don't just rely on technique, but you do require skill to learn it, and discipline. It's got to come from the heart. There's no reason the brain can't get involved, though. Oh, so pop music is mindless? I didn't say that. Why are you putting words in my mouth? I didn't say that. No, no. No, I'm not putting words in your mouth. I'm just repeating what I'm hearing here. It's not... Let's just stop arguing about this, it's silly. Who's arguing? We're not arguing, we're just talking about what we think. Well, you wanna know what I think? I think I'm gonna beat you in this contest. (laughs) Okay. Well, maybe if all the judges are over 80, you might have a chance. Okay, wow. Well, we'll see. Yeah. Yes, we will. (bell ringing) You made the right choice, I promise. Christmas carols can be a lot of fun. We don't really celebrate Christmas at my house. Don't celebrate Christmas? Who doesn't celebrate Christmas? My mom thinks consumerism has corrupted the message. Well, you don't have to celebrate Christmas to enjoy the music, take it from me. Liz, Amy, Amy, Liz. Hey. Hey. So can I just tell you, I am, like, crazy excited. I've never been on television before. Well, except on YouTube. You're on YouTube? Someone posted a clip of me at a party one time. I didn't find out until a week later. By that time, it already had 300 likes. Okay, you know, let's... Let's get started. I want you to take this home and work on it on your own before we start putting it together. What song did you pick? Here you go. "Angels We Have Heard on High." In two-part harmony. (huffs) What's the matter? My mother sings this. In church. It's totally lame. Well, then it'll be up to us to make it exciting. We'll sound like old bags singing this. It's all in the arrangement, I promise. Let's at least try it. I mean, yeah, it's really old-fashioned, but it's got a basic melody that we could really embellish. Embellish? It means, you know, decorate. I know what it means. I've just-- I've never heard anyone use it in a conversation before. Just try it. If the arrangement is too complicated, I could help you with it. I think I can figure it out for myself, thanks. See ya. Bye, Liz. Don't worry about her. She'll be fine when she starts working on the material. You just... learn your part. You can be the good example. Right, Miss Thiessen. (chuckles) Diana? I'm glad I got you before I left. Do you have plans for next Saturday night? Um, not that I'm aware of, no. Well, then I apologize for the late invitation, but I am hoping you can join me for Christmas dinner practice. Christmas dinner practice? Yeah. It's part of my stress-reduction program. I have always been concerned about Christmas dinner being perfect. No longer. Okay. I'm having a trial run. You're making Christmas dinner twice. Right. And that's gonna be less stressful? Well, this way, I can get reviews for the food before I serve it to the real guests. Oh, not that you're not a real guest. So it-- It wouldn't just be me? Oh, no, no, no. I need more than one opinion. (singsong) My nephew will be coming. (laughs) He has just come out of a very serious relationship and I would like him to meet somebody special. He is a great guy. I think you two would really hit it off. So, will I see you then? Well, if it's gonna help relieve your stress, why not? Oh! Shall we say... 5:00 for drinkies? 5:00 for drinkies it is. And thank you. No. Thank you. (long exhale) How do you do? My name is Diana. (doorbell rings) Hi, I'm Diana. You can call me Dee Dee. (quietly) Dee Dee? Who calls me Dee Dee? Hi, I'm Diana. You can call me anytime. Hello? Hi. (laughing) Hi. Oh, Diana, don't you look lovely? Oh, thank you. I got you a bottle of pinot. Oh, thank you. Now, unfortunately, my nephew won't be able to join us 'cause his car broke down, but it's all right. Oh. I've invited somebody else from school. Come. Hey. Hey. (Diana) Uh-huh. (laughs) (dishes clank) Great. Mm-mmm. So... So, how is the stuffing? Oh, it's-- Excellent. Do you like the tarragon? Did you taste it? Tarragon, yeah. Mm-hmm. I think so, yeah. Is there enough onion? I thought so, yeah. I don't know if this is spicy enough. I know some people say a spice rub, but I say wrong, wrong, wrong. A spice rub is okay for the skin, but to get down deep into the meat, nothing beats deep brining. That is what my dad always used to say. Every Christmas, we would brine the turkey together. Brining. No, deep brining. Of course. Well, even better. Well. Oh. Well, then, I'll clear the table for dessert. I'll get-- I'll get that. Oh, hey, let me do that. Oh, no. I got it. No. No, no, no, no, no... I'll get this, I'll get it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've got a system, you'll just be in the way. Are you sure? Oh. Okay. I think I'm gonna get a little fresh air, counteract the tryptophan. Hey. I'll-- I'll join you. Do you know what would be fabulous? I'm already done decorating the front yard, but I haven't finished the backyard yet. You decorate the backyard, too? Well, it's the little things that make the holiday perfect. The devil is in the details. Right. Like deep brining. You see, he gets it, he gets it. He's been around the block more than a few times. I think you're wonderful, Ken. Oh. Okay. Thank you. That's-- I-- Well, this wonderful person's gonna help you put up some Christmas lights in the backyard. How about that? Okay! Okay. Okay. Oh, I see you got-- Well, then. Here-- Oh, my goodness. Whoops. Could you give me a hand with this? Okay, yeah, sure. I got that. Now. Thank you. All right, but no shop talk, all right? Let's just forget about school this weekend, all right? We'll do our best. (laughing) Okay, have fun. Hey, let me get this. (clearing throat) (Ken laughing) She hasn't finished decorating the backyard? Wow. (laughs) Hey, listen, I'm actually glad we got this time alone together because I just wanted to apologize. You know, there's no need for us to argue. It's ridiculous. I mean, we're mature, responsible adults. And we're acting like third-graders, right? Truce? (laughs) Truce. ♪ You know, this used to be my favorite part of the Christmas meal. Not the eating 'til you're stuffed, but the conversation afterwards, you know? It's different than the talking before? Oh, yeah, sure, absolutely. You know, before it's all catching up and, you know, what's going on in your life, blah, blah, blah, but after, when everybody's just sort of skirting on the edge of falling asleep and people tend to, you know, talk a bit slower and let their guard down, and it's less about just socializing than it is really communicating. You know what I mean? I never thought about it like that before. Yeah, well. I have my moments. Ooh. Colder than I thought out here. I'm gonna go get my other coat. No, no, here, take mine. Oh, no, you'll catch a cold. No, don't be silly. I insist. I'm hot-blooded. I'm never cold. It's true. Are you sure? Yes, absolutely, I insist. Okay. So... Now what? (laughs) You know, I'm glad Jessica invited me over tonight, because I was actually planning on cleaning out my cupboards. Ooh, that's depressing. I like to do mine at Christmas. What? Christmas? (chuckles) How dare you? Christmas is supposed to be all, you know, music and parties and lights and mistletoe and biting the head off of delicious gingerbread men, right? Well, at least we've got the contest to look forward to. You're not really looking forward to it, are you? Of course, aren't you? Not-- No. Not at all. I can't wait for it to be over. You really like things like that? Well. Can't win if you don't compete. Wow, you're the second person that's told me that this week. Oh, you're gonna be fine. You'll be fine. (laughs) Thank you, yeah, I'm-- I'm sure I will, too. (laughs) Well, then. Let the best coach win. (Gedler vocalizing) Wow. Hello! Who's ready for some croquembouche de Noel? Huh? (chatter, laughter) Hey. (music playing) Nice. Ah. Whoa. There he is. Sorry. Lost track of time. It's okay. But just please, please, in the future, try to be on time, okay? Uh, Billy, Carlo, Carlo, Billy. You know each other? Uh, no. Hi. Hey. He's the other singer? Yes, he is, yeah. He's fantastic, he gave a great audition. You both did, we're gonna win this thing. Cool. So what are we singing? Uh, I haven't decided yet, but I will let you know as soon as I do and I'll have a rehearsal schedule posted as well. I'm available pretty much whenever, so. Perfect. I have to work around wrestling practice. Billy. I told you at the audition, if you were chosen, this is gonna have to take priority, right? Yeah, but I'm the captain of the team now. I kind of have to show up. Don't worry, I'll figure something out. See ya. Come ready to work.

I don't think so. She owns the TV station. Then that's great for us, isn't it? I don't know. She may hold you to a higher standard to appear unbiased, you know? Is she a musician? Well... let's just say that she is-- She's very enthusiastic about the arts, but she doesn't-- Doesn't really know anything about them. So how's she gonna judge? Well, she's gonna really very heavily on the phone-in vote. Well, if she's insecure, I mean, she might just go for the tried and true, sort of classical sort of Christmas carol.

I'm Amy's mother. She told me this morning about the singing contest. Oh, she didn't tell you before? No, because she knew what I would say. I wish you had asked my permission before casting her. I don't want her competing. But Amy has such a gorgeous voice and she's so excited about the contest-- I know all that. But Amy can't handle the stress. Things build up inside her. She... She can't sleep or eat and finally, she's a nervous wreck. With all due respect, Mrs. Barnes, I think you're underestimating your daughter. I think Amy can handle more than you think she can. And what better way to prepare for life than to take on things that challenge and scare us? With all due respect to you, Miss Thiessen, my husband and I have gone to great lengths to teach our daughter the true values of Christmas. Giving, love, togetherness. We've done missions in Mexico just to get away from the very commercialism and consumerism Christmas has become, and now you want to put her on a television show sponsored by the very consumerism we loathe so that she can sing like some kind of trick animal? Oh... I don't think so. Your job is to teach, Miss Thiessen. I'll do the parenting. I would never, ever allow your daughter to be treated like some sort of trick animal. I mean, I really-- I truly believe this has been great for Amy and ever since she's been singing, she's... She has come alive in class. She participates. She raises her hand, she's involved. She's really starting to come out of her shell. I genuinely think this is good for her. Would you please reconsider? If I can see that it's too much for her, I'm pulling her out. Agreed. And thank you. Thank you so much. Wow, who hates Christmas that much? Do you know, I don't even think it has anything to do with Christmas. I think she is a mother so afraid of her child getting hurt that she'll do anything to protect her, which, of course, just ends up hurting the child more in the long run. Obviously, I can't tell her that. Yeah, no, obviously. What's that strange little inflection in your voice? Nothing. Uh... I'm a person who makes my living using my ears. I know a strange inflection when I hear one. It's just kind of funny listening to you talk about somebody else sabotaging. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Forget it. What do you think I'm sabotaging? Come on, Diana. You've been talking about how you haven't had a personal life A.D. A.D.? After Dave. Oh, come on. I don't have time for that. Time for that, I know. You know how I know? 'Cause you've been saying the same thing for the last four years. You were just saying at lunch how you're gonna spend another Christmas alone. I mean, come on, Christmas is just a day. Yeah. No, it's not. And you know it's not. It's meant to be spent with the people you care about who care about you. Come on, girl, get off your butt, go find somebody. Ugh, I just hate the bar scene and I can't even imagine going to one of those ridiculous singles clubs. It's just not my thing. Wow, you are so far behind the time. Let me bring you up to speed. We have this nifty little tool now called the Internet where you can go on it and there are tons of sites where you can meet men. Ugh, I just don't think-- I don't know. I just can't do that. Why? You just look at it like a screening process, you know, you-- you find somebody, you have a drink, go for dinner. If there's no spark, who cares? You just start over. Maybe. It would be nice to meet someone. Yes. Right now, I gotta concentrate on winning this contest. Yeah. Hey, did you hear that this Estelle Barlowe is one of the judges? Yeah. She's on the board of governors. You knew that, right? I just found out. It's starting to feel less like a Christmas concert and more like a job interview. This is crazy. I can't believe that you're gonna lose your job if you lose the contest. I can. More and more every day. Well, you know what? You gotta win. I'm working on it. See you tomorrow. Bye. Hi, Liz. Not now. I have a major tweet to send. What's up? I just heard Miss Thiessen say that she may lose her job if we don't win this carol contest. That doesn't seem fair. What if Mr. Stoddard loses? He'd be out of a job. There. Lucky for Miss Thiessen, she's always been nice to me, huh? Hey. Hey. Liz just tweeted whatever teacher wins the contest gets to keep their job. Oh, dude, please don't tell me you subscribed to Liz Strait's Twitter account. Are you really interested every time she gets a triple-shot six-pump soy vanilla latte? No. But I want to find out what the competition is up to. Good for you. It's about time. I thought you forgot this is a contest. No. So we have to win or Mr. Stoddard gets axed, huh? That's what it sounds like. There's got to be ways we can get an advantage. (bell ringing) Great. (chatter, laughter) Good morning. Hey. Hey. Why are you so happy on a cold Monday morning? I took your advice and signed up for an online dating site and they sent me a match. Are you serious? That is so exciting. (gasps) What's his name? They don't give out names or addresses. It's a security thing, so you go out with them and then you decide if you want to give them your number, but judging from the answers on his personality quiz, he seems perfect. Yeah? Oh, wow. So when do you get to meet him? Uh, day after tomorrow. We're having dinner. Ooh! I want to hear all the details. I'm serious, don't leave anything out. Hey, I will, I promise, but keep it down, I don't want the whole school knowing. Don't worry, I won't say anything, I promise. I have got a great feeling about this. Really? Yeah. (instrumental Christmas music playing) (chatter) It's gonna be good, it's gonna be fine, it's gonna be-- Sorry, just thinking out loud. Hi, I think you're number 29-- What are you doing here? I have a horrible feeling the same thing that you are. Well, there must be some kind of mistake. Yeah, I'm-- I'm sure there is, but I am 29-82. Yeah. Wow. Um... Hmm. Well, I guess there's no reason to stay. No, no, wait, wait, wait. I mean, since you're here already and you obviously spent a lot of time getting ready. Not a lot. Well, you look great. Thank you. Beautiful, actually. Oh. Thanks again. Do you want to sit down and have a glass of wine and we can figure out how all this happened? Yeah. (laughs) Oh, thank you. (clearing throat) So why did you say your favorite music was classical. Ah, because it is. What I teach in class doesn't necessarily reflect what I listen to at home, you know? Like Brahms? Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I can barely get through his horn trio without crying. (laughs) I played the piano part in recital once. It was one of the most incredible moments of my life. To, uh... Yeah. So do you have classical training? Me? Oh, no, no. I'm, uh... more of a pop kinda guy when it comes to performing. Oh, you don't like pop, I forgot. That's not true. No, no, it's enjoyable. It's not important. Well, important like Beethoven or Brahms? No, I don't think it is. So what's your definition of important? Will people 100 years from today be performing it? Do we live 100 years from today, though? You know, I-- Popular music is important to people who live today. That's fine, but I just want to show people that there's more available than what they hear on the top 100. I mean, there are over 300 years of some of the most incredible sounds man has ever created just waiting for them. Sure, but you can't force people to like classical music by putting down what they like. I'm not putting it down. Mm. You know what? This isn't gonna work. What do I owe you for the wine? Don't be silly. No, I insist. No, really, I invited you, I'll pay for the night. Fine. Thank you for the short but lovely night. Enjoy your dinner. So she thinks my music is simplistic and my class is a bunch of imbeciles. She said that? Okay, yeah. She said that? Well, I mean, some reading between the lines here, but basically. Man, that's tough. That's-- Well, on the lighter side, at least you know the next date's gonna go better. Oh, no. There's not gonna be a next date. Trust me. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You gotta get back in the saddle when you're thrown off. Yeah, that's assuming one wants to ride again, okay? I'm giving up, I'm-- I'm done. You can't do that. Why not? You can't-- You can't do that. Why not? So I'm alone. Big deal. It's easier that way. Easier? Yeah. Who said anything about life being easy? Life is complicated. That's what makes it interesting. Oh, Gary, honestly, don't... No, no, listen to me. Listen to me. You can't just settle, dude. You know what's settled? What? The sludge. The sludge at the bottom that nobody wants. You gotta figure out what you want from life, man, and you gotta fight for it. Give it another chance. Oh, God... Give me the-- give me the-- the printout with your answers on it. Why? I got an idea. I got an idea, hear me out. Okay. We are gonna write in the opposite answers of what you put in the first time. Uh, what is it, favorite food. What's your favorite food? Italian. Italian. All right, Italian. Now it's Thai. Why? Why are you bothering? Because this way, we're guaranteed to find someone completely opposite of what you got tonight. That's what you want, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I want. Okay, so Thai it is. Yeah, but you can't just give up. I'm no good at it, okay? Romance just isn't my game. (laughing) Well, now, that's interesting. What? How you just described romance. Please, no amateur psychoanalysis. Okay. Because it meant nothing. Okay. It's just a figure of speech. Okay. Would you please stop saying "okay" like that? Let me ask you a question. You competitive. Yeah, I'm competitive. Okay. And every time you get involved in a game, what do you want to do? I want to beat my opponent. Diana. In romance, when you wind up in first place, you don't win. You only win when you both win. ♪ (chatter) That's great, guys. Whoa. Another one. Fantastic. (bell ringing) Oh, morning, Liz. Seriously?

This will make your eyes pop, okay? Uhn. Come here. Stay still. (Billy) They're using glamour shots. It isn't fair, they know we can't compete. Ugh, guys, get this down. You, you two.

(laughter) Christmas has always been a source of inspiration for composers, so just-- Over the next week, while you're on holiday, listen out for the music you're hearing. So, like, "Jingle Bell Rock." (laughter) Well, I was thinking a little bit more along the lines of the music you might hear at, you know, church. (drum beating) Uh, church bulletins are usually really good about listing the names of composers, but if you-- you can't-- (sighs) If you can't hear it. Hear it? Can't hear myself. Ha ha, that's it. You know what? You want loud? I'm gonna give you loud. Girls, I have a very special Christmas treat for you. Now, Tchaikovsky wrote this to commemorate the defeated Napoleon when he invaded Russia. It juxtaposes two melodies. "God save the Czar" and "La Marseillaise," and it's always, always meant to be played really loudly. (music blaring) Ha ha! Can you hear that, boys?! Feel that? Come up here, come up here, girls, come up here. Come up here, everybody, everybody! He used actual cannons while recording this. What is going on in here? (music stops abruptly) You, you, in my office. Now! (chatter) Call me old-fashioned, but I expect my teachers to be a little bit more mature than their students. He started it. Not what I want to hear, Diana. Look, I don't think either of us was in their right mind today. And I-- I'm as much to blame as Diana is here. It's the contest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is, you know? It's supposed to be a celebration of Christmas and... It's bringing out the worst in everybody. Myself included. Look. I'm sorry for the way things have turned out and I'll try to reign my team in. Me too. Well, it's a little late for that. The whole school's in an uproar. And for the record, I never encouraged them to act that way. Nor did I. And I promise to stop at the rhythm section, too, I'm... You know what? It's fine. At least you're getting your kids interested in music. I mean, maybe-- Maybe my approach is a little dry. No, don't be silly, it's-- You're teaching facts. It's a school, that's what you're supposed to be doing. Do what you can and let's just be thankful this whole thing will be over in two days.

You think I did this on purpose? How else? No, no, no, no, let me tell you something. I did everything in my power to have it not be you, okay? You know the questionnaire? I changed all my answers to the exact opposite to be-- So did I. Which is why the computer matched us up again. It makes perfect sense. Wow. Yeah. I'm starving, should we-- Do you want to just eat? Should we have a meal? We both know that the computer messed up twice, which is amazing to me. But no pressure. A meal between colleagues. As long as I can pay half. You don't-- No, please, I know what teachers make. (laughs) Let's go. (Ken) You know, I figure if I make the most of the time I'm living now, I'll be ready for whatever the future brings. Have you always been this practical? Mm. (laughs) Well, my father lived in the future, which kind of made the present a little difficult. You know, hard to feed a family on a tip jar, right? Tip jar? I thought your father was an undertaker. Mm. My stepfather. My biological dad pretty much lived on the road, playing honky-tonks and bars. Yeah. He was the original piano man. Except he played the trumpet. That's where you get your love of music. Yeah. Were you close? Um, he passed when I was 17. I didn't really know him. I mean, I knew him, he was charming and funny and everything, but more legend than father. That must have been hard. Yeah. You know, I tried hating him for years, I did, but I just-- I couldn't, you know? And every time I missed him, I could just put on his old records and he was right there with me. Hank Williams, Dean Martin. God, Elvis. Yeah. The music kind of kept us together. That's beautiful. Yeah, I played his "Elvis Live in Memphis" album so many times, it had so many scratches, I actually had to throw it out. (laughs) There is such a thing as downloading, you know? No. Something about vinyl. I'm telling you. It's funny, 'cause you know, my dad, it was always his dream to perform live on television, right? He never did. And now here I am with this contest, on TV, and the only thing I might get is a chance to keep my job. God, it's... Pathetic, isn't it? Pathetic? (chuckles) You want pathetic? I married my high school sweetheart. We were in love. Everything was going right until, of course, it wasn't. It was Christmas Eve and we were having a Christmas party. He would later say he was innocently getting eggnog from the spare fridge in the basement, but I went down there and there he was, my husband. Kissing another woman. I replayed that moment over and over and over again. Where did we go wrong, you know? Was there something I could have done? To this day, I haven't cleaned out that refrigerator. Now, that's pathetic. No. No, it's not. It's not. I'm sorry. Don't be. It wasn't meant to be. Well, I guess we just have to make the most of the time we're in.

Miss Thiessen and Mr. Stoddard are an item. You're right, I don't believe it. Some guy posted a tweet about it last night. Apparently, they were staring lovingly into each other's eyes for hours. You're kidding. Yeah, that's what I said. But he said they were there for hours. This is a problem. What happens when one of them gets fired? Yeah. Wow, that's harsh. I don't want her to get fired. But if she keeps her job and he doesn't, he'll dump her. Why? Because she's undermining our team. He's gonna stop wanting to win. How do you know? Amy. Because I know men. Oh, come on, man. Adults aren't like that. Are you serious? Carlo, read your history. Caesar and Cleopatra, ring any bells? Well, I guess there's nothing we can do about it. It's just not fair. I mean, for Ms. Thiessen to find someone at her age? And then lose him? Or lose her job. Do you think we should take a dive? Deliberately lose? Uh, no. We should just try our best and hope that everything works out. He's gonna stop wanting to win and we have to fight back. Oh, Billy, Carlo, the studio just called to remind us of the technical rehearsal on the 23rd. 4:30, right? Yes. Billy, do not be late. Yeah, I'm on it. No, I'm serious. No-shows are disqualified. No, Mr. Stoddard, got it on my calendar, we're good. Okay. See ya. See ya. Oh. Hi, Hi. Hi, Miss Thiessen. Hi. Hey, you. Hey. How are you? Just want to come by and say thank you for last night.

Listen, Diana... Ken, I... (laughs) Sorry. No, no, no, no. Go, you go first, please. Um, I just-- I just wanted to say, no matter what happens, it's just a job, you know, and I-- I just wanted you to know that. And I'd really like to see you again. That's-- That's great. I was about to say the exact same thing. Really? Yeah, I'm-- I'm serious. I have this, like, overwhelming desire to sit and listen to old records with you. Are you asking me over to listen to old records? I know, I know. It sounds incredibly high school, but I don't have an MP3 player, okay? Okay. But I think it could be fun. Definitely. After the contest, I'll definitely take you up on that. Great. Good luck. Yeah, hey, you too. You too. Hi. Oh. Hello. Can I sit here? Um. Yeah, sure, no one's using it. (distant chatter, laughter) I knew I'd find you here. I hate the cafeteria. You drop a bunch of boys into an all-girls school, you're bound to get a food fight or two. (laughing) I wanted a chance to talk to you. I-- I want to wish you good luck in the contest. Yeah, right. No, really. I've overheard you rehearsing a few times and you're really good. Thanks. Of course, I think we're really good, too. But I guess that's up to the judges to decide. (sighing) I... I just wish this was over. Oh, so do I. Yeah, I just thought we were gonna rehearse and go out and sing. Who thought it would get this involved? I mean, half the school is cheering me on and the other half wants me to drop dead.

See you at the rehearsal, girls. We can't wait any longer. I'm sure they're gonna be here any minute. But you did tell them that rehearsal started at 4:30, right? Yes, of course, I mean, they said they were coming right after their rehearsal. Something must have happened. Hey, this is Liz, can't come to the phone, but I'm dying to hear what you have to say. (beep) Liz, where are you? We're here at the studio, we're waiting for you. Please, please, call me back as soon as you get this. (phone beeping) Come on, give me at least one bar. Why didn't you check the gas before we left? Because, my father always takes care of it, okay? I don't even think about it. Obviously. Oh, don't start. This has never happened before. They're gonna kick us out of the contest. You know what, Amy? It's not our fault, okay? No, it's not our fault. Running out of gas is your fault. Great idea. Let's fight, because that's what we need right now. (sighs) We need to hitch a ride. Hitch hiking's dangerous. We're not asking someone to take us to Hollywood, just the television station. Shut it down. (alarm buzzing) Shut it down. Look, it's 12 past. I gotta disqualify your team. I'm sure they'll be here any minute. (phone ringing) Liz, where are you? We ran out of gas, I couldn't get my cell phone to work, so this nice lady picked us up. We should be there in about 20 minutes. They ran out of gas, they'll be here in 20 minutes. Yeah, but my crew's on overtime already. I gotta say no. (sighs) We're disqualified. What? They can't do that. Yes, they can. Look, I'll meet you outside the station to pick up your car with some gas, okay? Look, I'm-- I'm sorry, but we did publish the rules. No, I know, it's not your fault, it's just-- it's rotten luck. Thanks anyway. (sighs) Oh, they nailed it. Yeah, both of them, it was-- One second. I wanna talk to you. Looks like you got one less competitor. I'll call you back. What, what? The girls ran out of gas. They missed the deadline, so they're out of the contest. Oh, no. Well, it looks like you're a shoe-in. I'm-- I don't wanna win like that. Oh, you probably would have won anyway. Your team sounds amazing. They're really good. You're a good coach. Thank you. I'm-- I am so sorry. That's... Thanks. Do you wanna get out of here? Can I buy you a coffee or something? That's really sweet, but I'm gonna go, just bring the girls back to their car and... Okay. I'm just gonna go to sleep. I think it's... It's been a long day. (sobs) Hey, hey, come here, come here. If there's anything at all I can do, just-- just let me know, okay? (sighs) Just stand here for a minute. (chatter) Liz' father filled up the gas tank just the day before. There's no way she ran out of gas. Maybe he had the wrong date. He didn't. He had the receipt and Amy told me she only drove to school that morning. Somebody drained that tank. Come on, you don't seriously think that-- What am I supposed to think? You know what? I knew it, I knew it. It's always the quiet ones, the ones that say they don't care about winning, it's all about playing the game. Okay. So you're telling me that you think that Ken drained the gas tank. Oh, maybe not him, but he probably put one of the boys up to it. What else am I supposed to think? I don't know, Diana, why don't you ask him? Because I am never gonna talk to him again. Okay, well, you can't do that, that's impossible, he teaches right next door to you. Just talk to him. You know what? He's probably in there right now gloating and laughing. Diana... But do you know what the most infuriating part is? The most infuriating part is that I fell for it. That's the thing that slays me, I fell for it. Okay, well, for what it's worth, I think he's innocent and I think you think so, too. What? I think you like him and I think that scares you and I think you are finding every reason to just push him out of the way. That is so stupid. Oh, really? If it were anybody else in the world, you would not be jumping to these conclusions. But you are so afraid of getting hurt that you are protecting yourself before it happens. Look, I thought we had something, you know? I thought... I thought for the first time in years, I actually connected with a man. You did, honey, and that's what's driving you crazy. You've been through the fun part, this is the scary part, 'cause now you have to trust him and it's tough, I know, but it's worth it. He's a good guy, just talk to him, give him the benefit of the doubt. (drum pounding) Hey. Hey. So how's it feel to be a winner? There's still other teams to beat. Yeah, we're the best and you know it. Especially after I took care of the competition. No need to thank me, just admire my genius. Oh, yeah? What are you talking about? Well, you know how they use sexy posters? I used my own methods. What did you do to their car? It's fine. I just borrowed one of those cell phone blockers from one of the computer geeks and taped it to the inside of their bumper. Oh, yeah. And I drained most of their gas out. Billy, you're an idiot, man. What? They could have gotten into an accident. Yeah, but they didn't, they're fine. No, look, you have to tell Mr. Stoddard. Are you kidding? I don't win by cheating. So you're gonna go crying to Mr. Stoddard about it and tell him the truth like a little baby? No. You are. Make me. All right. Oh, what? You think I can't because I'm in this chair? Look, I'll tell you what. You win and I keep quiet. I win and you tell Mr. Stoddard. Come on, Carlo. I'm the captain of the wrestling team. Yeah, so what? I move more weight with my arms every day than you do in a month. What, are you scared? Come on, you little chicken, put up or shut up. Or are you scared of a kid in a wheelchair? Count of three. One. Two. Three. (Billy grunts) Call the station. The number's already in my phone. Hello. Yeah, hi. Can I speak to whoever's in charge of the Christmas carol contest? (Ken) What are you doing here? I got a call from Estelle Barlowe telling me to come as soon as possible. Yeah, same. Mrs. Thiessen, Mr. Stoddard, walk with me. Is there some sort of problem? Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, a rather large one. I had a phone call from one of your boys, Mr. Stoddard, confessing that he had drained the gasoline from the girls' car and that's why they missed rehearsal. I should have known. Maybe you did. Excuse me? No, no, no, no, no, please, I have a more pressing problem. This telecast starts in a few hours. Now, how am I to deal with this revelation? Well, I totally understand if you disqualify my team. Ah, but I understand that it was just one boy who was responsible. I have a pretty good idea which one. It's not fair to punish the other boy as well. Let me think about this for a minute. (Estelle) Hmm. Ooh, ooh, ooh, I have an idea. I am judging this contest on a point system of my own devising. Now, I am counting phone-in response, texting response and of course, my own assessment of song choice, uniqueness of arrangement, performance and appearance. It was a very nasty trick for your boys to play on the girls, and so I am going to allow the girls to perform. And I'm going to give the boys, your team, a five-point disadvantage going into the contest. Does that strike you as fair? Absolutely. Can you get the girls here in an hour? Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Good luck, both of you. Thank you, thank you so much. Thanks, great. Uh, hey, hey, listen. I didn't know anything about that, okay? I don't-- You know what? I don't have time to talk about this right now. (door knocking) What are you doing? Miss Thiessen just called. They're gonna let us compete after all. Amy. No. Mom, I'm going to do this. I have to. You cried yourself to sleep last night over this stupid contest. I told you it was a mistake and now you're gonna set yourself up to fail again. I'm not gonna fail. And last night was different. Amy, no. You're not going. Yes. I am. Mom, I know you only want what's best for me, but what I want, what I want is to do this. I know I can, I just need the chance. Honey... This is breaking my heart. I'm just trying to keep you from getting hurt. But the only way to never get hurt is to never do anything. I don't want a life like that. And I don't want some contest deciding whether you're a winner or not. That's not Christmas. But don't you see? I'm not doing this contest to win, but to give. To give to myself, and Miss Thiessen, and if that's not the meaning of Christmas, then I don't know what is. There's one more thing. Can I have an early Christmas present? Could you be in the studio audience when I sing tonight? Mom. Let me get dressed. Thanks!

So make sure the audience hears it, all right? Don't let Ethel Merman over here drown you out. She'll be great. Where are you gonna be sitting? Oh, oh, they stuck me next to Mr. Stoddard, but that's all right, it's just for an hour or so. Listen, don't look for me, all right? You just focus on your song, you're gonna be great. (host) All right, that's time. Could all the stage moms, all the coaches please find their seats in the audience? Thank you. Good luck! Did you hear that? Yeah, don't look for her in the audience. No, the part about her getting stuck next to Mr. Stoddard. Guess that romance fizzled, huh? No, I think she blames him for what Billy did. Harsh. Look at me. Forget everybody else, okay? They don't matter, you're not in competition with them. You're competing against yourselves. That's it. You know the material, you've got the technique, you've got everything you need, okay? Now, just get out there and just-- hit your personal best, all right? You can do it, you guys are great. Okay, Mr. Stoddard, I just want to say how sorry I am for everything. Yeah, it's fine, we'll talk about it after. It was such a stupid thing to do, and I just feel terrible-- Agreed. It was. But just concentrate on the song, we'll talk about it after, okay? You guys are gonna be great. Trust it. (host) All right, last call. If you're not performing, you don't belong backstage. Please, find your seats. Okay. (chatter) (host) How are y'all doing tonight? You ready for some singing? Now, obviously, you're gonna want to cheer for each and every act tonight, that's a good thing, but what we don't want is for you to heckle either any of the performers or your host. (cell phone ringing) All right, we have a few rules we've got to get to first. First up... Hello? It's Amy. (Diana) We're not supposed to be talking right now, the contest is about to start. I had something to tell you, I just remembered. The day we were late for rehearsal, we were walking toward Liz' car and Mr. Stoddard asked if we needed a ride. He did? If he knew our car was going to run out of gas, he wouldn't have offered us a ride. (host) Please, take a moment and find the one closest to you. You're right. Now is the time for you to turn off all electronic devices and cell phones. I've been totally wrong about everything. I said now's the time to give your cell phones a rest. Oh, I gotta go. Thank you. (man) Okay, folks, here we go, we're ready in five, four... I need to talk to you. Great timing. (cheering and applause) (host) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the fifth annual Christmas carol singoff. You're in for a night of incredible music and Christmas cheer. But first, a round of applause for the owner of this station and our very special judge tonight, Miss Estelle Barlowe! (cheering and applause) And now, please give it up for the dynamic duo from Zbigniew Brzezinski High. (cheering and applause) Are you crazy? Look, they're in love. It's this contest that's driving them apart. Yeah, but all contests do that. But maybe this one doesn't have to. Okay, I was thinking... (whispering) I-- I can't. It has to wait. Amy, that's a great idea. Yeah. All right, I'll send a note to the judge, and here, turn around. Let's hope she lets us do it. ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh (cheering and applause) Incredible. Congratulations. Just fantastic. Well, we were supposed to have two more teams competing tonight. Instead, we have one special surprise. Estelle? Until a few months ago, Kasdan and Creswell were two different schools with two very different ideas on how to teach music. When they merged last summer, they kept both music programs, and so we agreed to allow two separate vocal duos to compete tonight. But I learned just before the program that the teams want to merge just as their schools merged, and so... Our final contestant is the double duo of Kasdan-Creswell! (cheering and applause) ♪ ♪ The first Noel ♪ The angels did say ♪ Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay ♪ ♪ In fields where they ♪ Lay keeping their sheep ♪ On a cold winter's night that was so deep ♪ ♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪ Sweetly singing o'er the plains ♪ ♪ Noel Noel ♪ And the mountains in reply ♪ Noel Noel ♪ Echoing their joyous strains ♪ ♪ Noel Noel ♪ Noel Noel ♪ ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ Noel Noel ♪ Noel Noel ♪ ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ Noel (trumpet playing) ♪ Noel Noel ♪ Angels we have ♪ Heard on high ♪ Noel Noel ♪ Sweetly singing o'er the plains ♪ ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ And the mountains in reply ♪ Noel Noel Noel Noel ♪ Echoing their joyous strains ♪ ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ (cheering and applause) (laughs) Wow. Yay! Well, the votes appear to be flooding in with Kasdan-Creswell taking and early and commanding lead. I've got to say, it's neck and neck between the boys and the girls' duos. It looks like it's gonna be a photo finish, I just-- I don't know how we're gonna be able to predict the-- Um... I think the computer crashed. I don't-- I don't think that it could handle the volume of calls. Oh, for heaven's sakes, forget all those computer-doodles. Get that silly thing out. I know who the winner is. Yes. All right, here we go. And the winner is... Kasdan-Cresswell! Woo! (cheering and applause) Bravo! Woo! Woohoo! Diana. Ken. Congratulations. Oh, you must be so proud. I was just talking to Estelle, who was obviously very impressed with what she saw tonight. And we both agreed that there's just-- It's just a tragedy when any excellent teacher is made redundant. Well, I can't argue that. Now, you know that she is a very close friend of many of the school's donors, and she knows... Well, now, how did she put it? She knows just what buttons to press and where all the skeletons are hidden, so I have a feeling that they will be able to come up with the funding for at least one more year of the program. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, isn't that great? That's fantastic. You were both so wonderful tonight. Oh, thank you, yeah. Merry, Merry Christmas to you both. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Yeah, Merry Christmas to you. That's great. Wow. Wow. Hey, Miss Thiessen! Um... (muttering) Yeah. Merry Christmas. It's-- It's not much. Are-- Are you kidding me? It's not much? "Elvis Live in Memphis"? Wow. Um... This is incredible. Where did you even find this? Well, contrary to what our students think, the Internet is good for things other than downloading music. eBay. Wow. Diana, I-- I didn't get you anything at all. Oh, don't be silly. This has been the most amazing Christmas. Really. I just wanted to say... Your father would have been really proud of you tonight. You played beautifully and from the heart. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, uh... You got any plans for Christmas? As a matter of fact, I do. Oh, really? What are they? I am gonna live every single moment. ♪ (laughing) ♪
