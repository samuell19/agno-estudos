Big Boss ordered us to stay low until the situation's checked Boss, I know a small cafe In the countryside It's very remoted should I make a call? There's too many of us People will notice, so not there Then...how about an island? They'll check our lDs on boarding, Bro We'll sneak in then The cops'll search there first And if we get caught, there's no way out, No! Then where can we go, boss? Cops will be everywhere They'll check for lDs We can't even go 10km like this I can't stand this anymore, Bros... What other choices do we have now? We'll end up in prison We'd be better off as bald monks There's no way out of this May I help you? Tell your boss to come out Mk. Dae-bong! Mk. Chung-myung! Mk. Myung-chun! What's going on here? We're running this temple now! I don't know why you're here, but this is a monastery for monks What's going on here? So... Monk Sir. Put that knife down Screw you... Are you the boss? What's going on out here? I'm the Master of this temple Whatever it is, let's talk inside Haven't you eat yet? What? I said have you eaten? So what do you want? We wanna stay here just for a week Well, it's not that easy living in a temple... Think it's easy to live as a gangster? Whether you like or not, We're staying here Tea is getting cold, take it Hey, Mr. Monk! We didn't come herefor fun. Our lives are in danger It looks like the fire in your eyes, Wonderful! But... Here are living conditions, No matter how he's older, be polite to all the monks Whether it's helping with firewood or cooking, you have to work for your meal And don't touch anything in Buddha's shrine Specially be careful not to disturb the monks' studies I'll let you stay here for a week It's not that complicated Just do as you've always done at our clubs You watch over that monk looks like a peanut. You take fatty, and you take toothpick The old man and kid are yours Got it, Boss The monks might call the cops Stick to them like glue Yes, Boss! Hey, monk You're pretty strong What were you before? I've always wanted to ask a monk that Why? Think I was some gangster? It looks like to me. Right? Yeah, I used my strength But not in a bad way like others Really? A man has to use his strength if needed Is that so? Then, let me ask you one thing Do monks get a hard on in the morning? I saw it on TV a while back Why do they ring the bell 33 times on New Year's eve? I mean, it's not ten or even twenty times But why does it have to be 33 times? Hey, monk...monk... Come on. This is like fate, so let's try to get along Monk, monk, monk... What shake on it Monk, so why did you become a monk? You look still very young to me Did you have a broken heart? Monk! You can tell me, I won't tell anybody...go ahead Monk...monk...Hey! Hey! Can't you see that I'm talking to you? I can't believe this Think I'm some clown? Think I'm not good enough? Think I'm some clown! If I ask you a question, you should answer Why are you ignoring me? Damn monk! What are you shouting for? Monk Myung-chun is on training of silence I know! But shouldn't he tell me that? Why doesn't he talk? He's being too silent! I'm only doing like this for our Master I've been here for just ten years, but I'm not as patient as my Master So do me a favor, stay out of trouble If you cause any problems... Well... What if I do? You should be silent whenever you eat Have a good lunch, Boss! You guys, too Yes, Boss That's enough How can they live of just vegetables? Hey, you. Come here! What are you doing? Please calm down Who the hell is he? Who is he? He's studying to be a lawyer Why didn't you tell us? You've never asked He rarely leaves his room, sometimes we couldn't see him in a month Does anyone come visit him? Not at all What the hell is he doing? Isn't it obvious? - As you seeing it that? - I don't know Hey, how's everything? I want play with you but don't enough time I have to study... have to find a water vein and do laundry, too so try to understand me I have to study for my classes, and even phys ed... I need to take out a loan then I'll need a signature stamp To make a stamp, I'll need wood then I go to mountain I don't know where I'm going then I have to lundury too...where... I'll start, Boss In this temple, there's one old man, four men and even a kid. so six people total There's that lunatic, too Then seven, plus Jogging Pants Hey, Rookie You take Jogging Pants Yes, Boss Damn Jogging Pants... Go on! In my analysis, he's the first to watch out for Senior monk Chung-myung He's the second in command here First, his body is built And I hate the way he looks at me The worst of thing is his double eyelids What else? Myung-chun Strangely, he never talks, but he's not a problem The problem is... this bastard. Hyun-gak He cuts the firewood I looked at the way he uses his ax and he's really awesome at it Then we'll just stop him from axing You're right. Bro Next is Dae-bong He's usually cooking stuff I saw him cook in the kitchen today He's very skillful with the knife Boss, let's take their tools Who know that? They might attack us in our sleep Yeah, Boss Just give an order I'll wipe all of them out If I chop two fingers, he can't use the knife That is my conclusion this temple... Hey! Think this is some Shaolin temple? What I mean... Stop talking nonsense Just watch over your man Control them with words And stay on guard at night, get it guys? Yes, Boss One, two, three... one, two, three... Break it Come on... Come on... Hey, Rookie! Is it working yet? One sec! I got a signal Boss, it's on! - It's working...woking... - You get it? We got three, three We're saved! I'm getting more! right here, boss! Here! Here! Three tiles from the end! Yes, three We're saved! So all the batteries are dead? Yes, Boss. The last one on the roof is almost out - Wait. Isn't it strange? - What is? Think about it. When we went to attack them, they were waiting for us It means that they knew we were coming So then? You mean one of us is a rat? - Forgive me, Boss - Forgive what? The ones who made that plan are Chang-geun and me And all of you... Damn it! I didn't want to tell you before, but when I called Big Boss, he said Chang-geun also got stabbed If Chang-geun's not the traitor, then it's me? You low-life scums. shit~ Anyway, Big Boss said he'll handle it himself So he'll probably call So how long will it last? Probably one or two hours at most Tell Rookie to come down We can still get a message if it's off, right? Yes, sir Let's stick here a few more days But boss. If we stay longer, the monks won't like it. Boss, let's just wipe them out Any longer, I'll turn into a monk Boss, I'm so bored I think I'm going nuts We have to stay here until we get the call So let's do what we can You said for only a week But now you want to stay more?

We are your followers, but why are you favoring those beasts? You dumb fools That's enough, so go away Master! Why are you siding with us like this? Who's siding with who? But, sir... I'm letting you stay since you solved my riddle. But who said I took your side? To live an honest life, or not to bother others There must be some reason for you to do this? Are you that curious?
