Bitch. Oi. Oi! Come on. Dyke. Cunt. Right. Next. Cat. Why don't you show what you have for us this week? Erm. He looks really cute here, I think. Erm. That's a very nice shot. Why don't you tell us a little bit about it? So, err, this is my Cat "Mr. Sniffles". This is his favourite place in the house. He likes to sit here a lot. What do you think the image evokes? I think it shows that he's looking out into the world from behind a sheet of glass. And he's in a safe place but it's also really lonely. It's good work Cat. But I tell what, how about your next portrait is of a person, someone close to you? Okay? Yes. What's going on? You good? Yeah, yeah - you good? Yeah man, I'm alright. I'm alright. Where have you been? I was just chillin' over there. Obviously with her, so... Oh that's her? Yeah. She's fit. Well I told you. What she like? What do you mean? Don't tell me you've not hit that. Oh. Bruv it's been weeks! Yeah, no, no, yeah. Like a bunch of times. Actually. Right, sure you have. I have. I have. How many times? I don't know, who counts? Well, you should. Why? How was it? Was it good? Was it bad? It was good. It was good. She's good. How long did it last? What do you mean, "it"? It's been more than once. Yeah, hang on, the first time. How long did it last? The first time you did it with her? I don't know man, I'm not timing it. So like it's just...it is what it is. What - 5 minutes? Half-an-hour? Two hours? Probably in-between that. In changes. You know. In-between what? Well it depends how many times you want to do it. So, you did it more than once in one night? Are we timing like, you know... ...if I'm doing it... How long did it take? That's what I want to know. How long did it take? I don't know. I don't know. Right. Yeah, okay, ten minutes. Give me details then. Why you so into details? Cause' I want to know! Well, I'm trying to respect her... You're my boy! I'm looking out for you here. I want to know. How are you looking out for me? Cause' you know I can tell you if you're doing something wrong or not. There's nothing wrong. Look at her. There's nothing wrong. Come on, I know what I'm doing. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I'll show you, but I've got to go see her now. Right. Show me. Show me how? I don't want to see you. I don't want to see! That's not what I meant. I've got to go. Shut up. You go show her. Fucking hell. Watch out. Fuck. Maybe if I switch the light on you'll appear. All your photos will be ruined! Then again, that would be a shame. I guess I'll just keep it then. Look, she's beautiful. What do you care? You're just a cat. Hey? We don't like him. That's better. Oh, wait. What's the rush? No rush. No rush. You know, I just... We can wait. We can wait. Okay. Where're you going? Home. I thought you were going to stay the night? That's sweet. But you know my mum doesn't like me staying over. What's this? Whose is this? That's mine. Don't you think I look rather good? Yeah, but, who took it? Some photography student at college. What's his name? It's a girl. And I don't know her name. Oh, that's alright then. If it was a guy it wouldn't be? No. Just why is she taking your picture? I don't know. You want it? Yeah, it's mine. Give it back. Give it back. It's mine. Maybe she's stalking you. Oh! Shut up. Just give it, give it back. Why do you want it? Cause it's mine. I have to go. Bye then. Seeing Mum tomorrow. Night Dad. I hope you're okay. On your own at home. Mum, I'm fine. Besides, I've got 'Mr. Sniffles' to look after me. How is the old grump? Mum. Well, shouldn't be much longer now. I'll be home in no time. Right, college is waiting. You'd better get going. That's a nice jacket. Your father used to wear one just like it. Bye Mum. Hello? What are you drawing? Nothing. Why have you been taking photographs of me? What are they for? I saw you, you know. The other day at the skate park. Anyway, I'm sorry I took your picture. I shouldn't have it's yours. It's fine. Okay, I'll go. Wait. What's your name? April. I'm, I'm Cat. Nice to meet you Cat. You can keep the photograph if you want? Really? Thank you. Are you doing anything...later? Are you doing anything, erm, tonight? I'm gonna go watch a film. You can come if you want? Okay, cool! Is it okay if I bring a friend? I've just got to go for a minute. Let me know if I miss anything. So that picture you took of April was nice. Thanks. Is that sort of your thing...taking pictures of girls? Models? No, not really. But you like taking pictures of April? She's very photogenic. Yeah, she is. Is it not just weird though? Is it not a bit...kinda awkward? No, I didn't find it awkward. You just sat there being miserable and you didn't even make an effort with her. Aw. I'm sorry that wasn't enough for you. No. I did try. I tried but she was...a fucking little moody bitch. No, she wasn't. Yes, she was. You ruined my whole night. I ruined your night? It was supposed to be our night. I was nice to invite you, I didn't have to invite you. Oh lovely, thanks for inviting me, that's great. Look can we just talk about it for a second? Can you just fucking stop for a second?! What is your problem? I don't want you to see her anymore? Why? Hey, leave her alone! Can you leave us alone you faggot! What the hell are you doing?! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, I don't know what happened. Just leave it, we'll talk about it another day. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We'd ought to get that seen to. Come on. Sit still. Sorry. You don't talk much, do you? So, you fancy me? You do, don't you? It's the only reason you'd be taking pictures of me. It's alright. I don't mind. I think it's quite sweet actually. There, all done. Thanks. Come on Jim, hurry up. Thanks. Here, you take this. Be careful. Heavy. April, darling, aren't you going to introduce us to your friend? Oh, Mum, this is Cat. Aha, the photographer. That's a serious lip ring you got there. Didn't you want one of them April? Yes, but of course, it's out of the question. Mum! Haven't you got homework to do? I think it's about time Cat went home. Sally...they don't have homework anymore. They're at college. She needs to practice, even if it is music. Mum! Come let's go. Sally, just let them go. Sorry about my mum, she can be a bit of a pain. Can you play me something? No. I'm not very good. That's not true. Just one piece. No. How about you show me some of your photography skills? Maybe you can teach me something. There is something you could help me with. I need to take a portrait of someone other than my cat. Yeah. Wow. It's so old and heavy. It's my dad's. Relax. Okay, erm, if you just want to look over there for me? Yep. Brilliant! That's...really good. April, these look amazing. Erm, do you just want to face me? Okay. Brilliant. Okay, my turn. Erm. Okay. But... Right, you got to let me show you how to use it first. Okay? Okay. Okay, so that's the shutter speed. So, this is your iris, so it allows a certain amount of light into the camera. And then this focus' it. So, you get a sharper picture. Okay, so when you're ready, you just press the silver button. See. Just focus it. Click. And then just wind it up. Okay. Okay? But you need to hold it the other way. No, I didn't mean... I didn't mean any... No, no, no, no. April? How else am I going to learn? I don't have my picture taken. Ever. Oh, come on, one picture? April? Just one! Please give me the camera. Just one picture? One. Okay. Okay, right, you need to hold it like...like that. Okay? Then just focus it. Ready? I like this one. They're nice. Look. That one. This one is my favourite. You look...beautiful. I mean look at your eyes. No, I look like a slut. You couldn't look like a slut even if you tried. Where's the one of the two of us? Oh, I don't know. I don't think I even put it in there. It wasn't very good in the end. There, that one. Really like that one. You should use that in your presentation. I'm never going to use that photo in my presentation. What would everyone say? So, what's it like being a gay then? I'm not really sure how to answer that. Have you had many girlfriends? No. So, have you fantasized about girls then? Well yeah. Have you ever fantasized about me? No. I do worry about you. Being on your own. Don't worry about me, I'm okay. I'm so sorry. I should be there for you. Instead I'm here with all these tubes feeding into me. Mum. It's okay. You'll be home soon. Besides, I've met someone. Really, who is he? Or should I say she? Mum. Tell me about her. She's wonderful. She's beautiful. And smart. And when I'm with her, I think I can do anything or nothing at all... Mum, I'm so happy. Sounds like you found someone really special. Hey. Hey. Haven't seen you much lately. I've been really busy. Practicing. Yeah sure, that's cool. Do you want to go to this gig tonight then or...? I... I don't think I can. I'm really behind with my course work. I'd really love to but it's just... I've just got so much to do... Right I see. Can't really. Sorry. How about next weekend then? Yeah, sure. We'll do that. Hey. Hi. So, I was thinking of going to a club tonight. Are you coming? To a club? Yes... Why not? I don't do that dancing and stuff. Dancing and stuff? Okay, fine. You don't have to dance but you're coming with me. Come on Cat. Do it for me. Come on Cat. Come with me...! Stop it! Come with me...! Stop it! Stop. Okay. Okay! Fine. Okay. You win. Great! But I'm not dancing. Okay you're not dancing. Deal. No, I don't like that. How about wearing the one I got you for your birthday? Hm? Ah, the photographer. Come in. Take a seat. I'll let April know you're here. So beautiful. April! Your friend's here! Come on, let's go. Hold on. Where're you going? Dancing. I told you. I thought you were going with Steven? No, he can't make it. Oh April, let me call him, I'm sure he'd like to go. No Mum! I don't want to see him. Oh, I see. Cat, is it? Don't get my daughter into any trouble. Come on. Is this it? April do we have to go? Don't worry, it's a really cool place. (there you go) Thanks (cheers) Let's go dancing. April, I... I don't dance. Come on! April! April, I don't dance. I don't dance. Oh sorry. Can you buy me another one? Back off! Are you okay? Yeah... It's just my top. It's ruined. Come with me. Totally ruined. My mum's going to kill me. Sure it'll be alright. Right. Give me your hoodie. Come on. It's nothing you haven't seen before. Right. How do I look? Good. Good? Good will do. Didn't realize this was a gay club. Why don't you just leave her alone? What are you? Her girlfriend? No...no I'm not her girlfriend. Bitch! Cat, wait! Cat wait up! Cat! Hey! What?! Please don't leave. We were having fun, weren't we? We can go somewhere else, somewhere quiet. Just the two of us? We can go anywhere. You can choose. Where do you want to go? Not back in there. Okay, agreed. Not back in there. Do you see that? Look it's a cat. There's its tail...and its legs and its body...and its little pointy ears. It's quite shy though, so it's kind of hard to see it. Let's go swimming. Wait, what? Come on! Ah! It's so cold! Aw. You're soaking. Can't sleep like this. Do you have anything I can borrow? You just going to stand there and watch? No. I'll just be in there. The bathroom. I'll just be... ...just... Oh hello. You're cute. Hey? Can I come in? What you doing? I'm going to sleep. Not down there you're not. Come up here, there's plenty of room. Who's that in that picture? Erm. It's my dad. Is that you? Yeah. My dad passed...passed away a few years ago. He had a heart condition. I remember him. Sometimes... It really feels like he's still here. Is that silly? No. And my mum... My mum is in hospital. I'm sorry. She's got lung cancer and, surprisingly, that hasn't stopped me from smoking. Sometimes I feel... Like I've made this all up... Like all of this couldn't happen to one person. I didn't want any of it to happen. But it did. Morning. Hi. You're quite the snuggler. Oh shit, my mum's going to kill me! What? I am so late. Can I borrow your hoodie? Yeah. Thank you. I've got to get changed. You okay? Alright, just tired. That's what you get for staying out all night. And whose is that horrible jumper? I never bought you that. Yeah I... heard you had a good time. Good band was it, or was it a DJ? They're okay. You and Cat have become quite good friends. Mind you though she's a little quiet. Can we talk about something else besides that girl? She's a bad influence! Well she seems fine to me. You really don't care do you? She went out and she had fun. And she's home safely now. So, what have you got to worry about? I'm worried, that girl will get our girl into trouble. Her name is Cat. I'm sorry, what was that? Her name is Cat! That was beautiful darling. I'm so proud of you. Thanks dad. Everything okay? I miss Cat. Why don't you go and see her? I can't. It's forbidden apparently. I know your mum said that you couldn't see Cat anymore. She's only doing what she thinks is best for you. But, to be honest. I don't think your mum always knows what's best for you. And neither do I. Only you know what you want. Sometimes in life...you've got to be a little bit selfish. I think, maybe, you've done enough practice for today - don't you? Hello? Yeah. Yeah. That's my mum. Mum? I'm sorry. I should have been here for you. Please get better mum. I really need you. Oh, what's wrong? I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I think you should stay here tonight. No, I don't think that's a very good idea. No, you should stay. April darling, I thought we could talk... You. What the hell do you think you're doing? Get up! Get out! Mum, stop! Stop it! Please! Sally what on Earth are you...? Stay out of it Jim! I'm giving this little brat a lesson that she'll never forget. Don't you dare come back! Cat? Fuck! April darling. I know you're angry with me. She's a bad influence. It's just a phase you're going through. Just a phase? It's not just a phase. Don't tell me what it is. April calm down. You dragged her down the stairs. What's gotten into you? Look at what she's done. All this is her fault. She opened my eyes, to you, to Steven, I know who I am now and I know what I want. You don't know what you're saying. Why's it so hard for you to believe? To accept me for who I really am. Because I won't have my only daughter think that she's a... A what?! A what Mum?! Get out. Get out! Get! Out! April. I hate you! What do I do dad? I really like her. It's just such a mess. What have you got for us today? No more cats I hope. Her name's April. I mean these are all very nice...why did you...why did you take them? She's very photogenic. So, I mean the...the image of your cat had so much more...more context. I mean these feel...these are staged. I wanted something personal, something...something moving, something from you. Is there anything, anything else you'd like to show? No. That's all. What your mum did was wrong. Don't tell her I said this but... Don't let anyone get in the way of your friendship with Cat. I think it's a bit late for that. I can't get in touch with her. No, it's never too late. Just got to try a bit harder. I mean it's not every day that someone comes along and likes you for who you are. Don't let anyone take that away from you. So, you don't hate me for liking her? April, you're my daughter. It doesn't worry me whether it's boys, girls, both... ...or even if you run off and be a nun. It's whatever makes you happy. Anyway. Hey. Thought you might be missing this. I took really good care of it. Yeah, it's fine. Oh, yeah, your hoodie. Keep it. Are you sure? Thanks. Can I come in? Don't. Leave it. April. Cat I'm sorry. It's all my mum, she's insane. Will you let me explain? Leave. But it's not my fault. Please let me be here for you. Get off. Are you okay? Go away. Now seriously, what's wrong? Leave me alone. I'm going home. Well can I offer you a lift then? No. I'm fine. Come on. Where're we going? Somewhere we can talk. Just take me home. I'm not in the mood. What are we doing here? This is where we had our first date. Don't you remember? How happy we were? Right, look. I know things haven't been great between us. I know that. I just thought we could make...you know, make things right, that's all. Do you know how much you mean to me? You mean so much and the thought that... That I fucked things up between us is unbearable. You're all that I want. You're all that I want, you're all that I need. I know you might not love me now. I get that and... I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. But I can't help the way I feel about you. No. Oh, come on, just a bit. No. Oh, come on. No! Take me home. You always do this. You're such a tease. Take me home. Now! You know what? No. That's not fair. I deserve this. That's what you deserve. Stop. April? April, it's just me. It's just me.
