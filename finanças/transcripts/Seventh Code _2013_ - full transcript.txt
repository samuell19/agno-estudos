SEVENTH CODE Matsunaga! Er, have we met before? We met at Roppongi in Tokyo. You invited me to eat with you. When? A month ago. Oh... But it was just the once, right? We never met again. Since that time, I've been unable to forget about you. And ever since, I've been looking everywhere for you. And I heard that you weren't in Japan, but in Russia. So I came here. I'm overwhelmed. Is that your luggage? Yes. You can't leave it there. Sorry. Come on. At that time I did invite you to chat with me at the restaurant, but I was with my friends, and I was also drunk. I just wanted to eat with everyone instead of eating alone. I don't have any feelings towards you. Is that so? You left the restaurant and totally forgot about me? Yes. I'm a little shocked. Listen to me: I'm Japanese, so it's fine. In a foreign country please do not believe strangers blindly. Especially when a man suddenly invites you to eat with him. Yes. Now... Where are you going? I'm just going to pay the bill. Matsunaga...? This is Matsunaga. This is Matsunaga. I'm Matsunaga, nice to meet you. I'm Matsunaga, nice to meet you. Matsunaga! Please wait! What should I do now? Please don't follow me any more. Matsunaga... What do you want? This place is not for tourists. Are you alright? There are cuts all over your body. Where are you from? China? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat at my house? Don't worry about me. - Do you need the menu in Japanese? - Yes. You are... I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese. What is that? Payment. It's not enough. This is all I have. This is bad. Please wait a minute. Eating without paying? Japanese tourists rarely do things like this. My passport, wallet... and suitcase were stolen. Then staying here is pointless. Go to the embassy quickly. I will definitely be deported back to Japan, right? Of course. I can't go home yet. I want to stay here for a while longer. I'm looking for someone. Who? A man? - Yes. - A Russian? No. A Japanese. Hmm... How are you going to find him without money? I... just realized... I can see people passing on the street from here, right? Yes. He'll probably pass by here. Can I stay here for a while? Eh? Allow me to work here. No, not possible. As you can see, we have few customers. In fact, we've decided to close the restaurant next month. But I still have to settle my bill. I understand. You don't have to pay. So, just leave and not pay? Yes, something like that. I don't like that. Then why not go to the embassy and borrow some money? I cannot. Then what do you want? What is your name? Akiko. Akiko, my name is Xiao Yan. Nice to meet you. Yes, nice to meet you, too. All your plans have been disrupted. It can't be helped. I was too careless. Xiao Yan, how did you end up in this place? At Da Lian I met that man. I was supposed to go to Japan. You mean the restaurant owner? Yes, his name is Saito. I followed him because he wanted to take me to Japan, but somehow we ended up here. I can't believe we've lived in this city... - ...for half a year already. - I see. You shouldn't get too involved with Saito. He's stingy. In Japan, he was a useless man. He's useless overseas as well. You're searching for someone in the city, right? Yes. If you don't hurry, you might not find him at all. Russia is huge. You don't have flour in stock? How can that be? I can't wait for one month. What will I do with my restaurant then? What? Marijuana? I don't need stuff like that; that has absolutely nothing to do with me. Okay, I'm not going to ask you to help me again. I'll find another way. Really?! I'm not sure whether this country actually has nothing or is lacking something. You can buy flour at a supermarket. Too expensive; we can't afford it any more. Then just make food that doesn't need flour. How can I make bread without flour? Just use a little trick. Replace it with wild rye or wheat. I want to make this place the most famous restaurant in Vladivostok. You said your dream is to make 100 million yen. That's true. How will you do that? I don't know. Dreams will eventually be just dreams. You're not trying hard enough. I've tried, it's just that I don't have any luck. After coming to this place, I failed here, too. It feels like ever since I left Japan, I was destined to fail. It's okay. There'll be a way to overcome it. How can you understand my feelings? Coward! Sorry, I only have this. This is enough for me. I can sleep anywhere. No Japanese will come here. Akiko, if you meet with this person, will the two of you continue to live in this city? Or will both of you return to Japan? Maybe. I don't know. I... don't really know him. Is that so? That's why I have a lot of things to ask him. How would he answer me? After hearing the answers, what will I do? If I can see him once more... maybe then I'll get my answer. Very interesting. Xiao Yan... Why did you stay with Saito? I don't know. Maybe because I have no problem staying with anyone, so long as that person can give me power. Power? I want power... Power that can change the world to the way I want it. For this, you definitely need money, right? But, Saito still cannot understand that. Although I forced him, he'll still say, "I will definitely get 100 million yen." But he wants to follow his own way, like to start a family, or to eat a delicious meal. He's only interested in things like that. He thinks that we should gain power first, then we can make money. I think that once you have money, the desire to gain power will follow. Do Japanese people think differently? I don't know. Thank you very much. No need to rush. I don't think there will be any more customers. All right. Why...? I want to sell cheap, tasty food. Russians! Always eating tasty food at home, but when they eat out, it doesn't matter, as long as as they are full. It seems like a hangover from Soviet Union days. Saito, did you open a restaurant in Japan? Me? Never. I worked in health insurance at the mayor's office. I thought I was going to do that for my whole life, and wasn't satisfied at all. That's why I left Japan, and travelled to many places. Well, something like that. Why come to Russia? Because I thought caviar will become popular in Japan. - Caviar? - Yes, caviar. It's very cheap here, about one-tenth of the price in Japan. I tried to sell it in department stores and supermarkets... but I failed. Japanese don't like caviar. That's true. Then I tried to sell honey... it was also a failure. Russian's honey is very famous, but it's not popular in Japan. I think there is no future. I always felt I was cursed. - What is it? - Sorry, I'm going out for a while! That car was heading towards town, right? - Which way is it? - There's a shortcut this way. - Saito, what about the shop? - Don't worry about it. No... Over here. Here! Over here! This way. Faster, through here! I'm going that way. Those are the guys who met with Matsunaga. You think he'll meet Matsunaga soon? Maybe... Wait! It may be dangerous. Matsunaga may be in there. - Then it will be dangerous. - Why? That is a mafia warehouse. I've heard about this place from someone. If Matsunaga has something to do with that place... Wait! It's too dangerous for us to go any further. No! I think it's best if we go back home now. I'll check that place out. Until we know what's going on, you shouldn't meet him. It's too dangerous. Don't underestimate Russia. Moreover, if I leave you alone, who knows what you'll do? Even though I'm a coward, I've encountered a lot of problems because of it. Alright. Thank you. I will leave this place. Oh? The time has come. Returning to China? No, I would like to explore more of Russia. I'm sure I'll find something. The power to change the world? Right! Someday Akiko will also follow me? "Now, for my heavenly days Moving golden vehicle The east winds of the hurricane Come now and encourage me" What is that? Yosano Akiko. Oh... Bye-bye. Hopefully, we'll meet again. Yeah. Good bye. Umm... - Last night, Xiao Yan... - I know, I was awake. Is that so? Let's leave that aside. I... Whether it's safe or not, I want to take a chance. - Chance? - Yes. Since yesterday, I've collected a lot of information from people I know. It seems there's a Krytron stored in that abandoned warehouse. A Krytron? An electronic part used in nuclear bombs. There aren't many left in the world. That's why they're really expensive. One of them is located in that warehouse. Impossible. Matsunaga would never do something like... No. He's involved in this, too. What do you mean? He's not a good person. If I die, it will be for a good cause. Saito? Some Asian who broke in here last night. I'll take care of the body later. Anyone else with him? I don't think so. Yes, let me think about it. Thank you. Good doing business with you. I will see you again, thank you very much. You're welcome. Stop. So it really is you! - What're you doing in a place like this? - Matsunaga! I really wanted to see you. A lot of terrible things happened to me. There's no one else I can count on. I don't know what I should do now. That's why I said not to trust any strangers. Yes... It can't be helped. Want to come to my apartment? Okay, come on. Let's go. Sit down. - Want some vodka? - Alright. By the way, I still haven't asked your name? My name is Akiko. Akiko? Yes... Wait a minute. Alright. Akiko? Akiko? Just who are you? It can't be! I've been deceived? I got the Kryton. As for the reward. I'll leave it up to you. I don't mind if it's not in Japanese yen. Right. Then half in euros and half in roubles. Yes, please. See you tomorrow. Sorry for the trouble. It's fine. No doubt that it's the Krytron? It's finally back in my hands again. Please help me take care of it. Me? I can't do it. After all, I'm a politician. Now? Please, by all means. I'm so relieved. Goodbye. Take care of yourself. You, too. I want to go to Moscow. I can drop you at Khabarovsk, but you'll have to sit in the back, It's okay, thank you. Don't touch the boxes. They contain dynamite.
