** You know, baby, I-- I don't think I ever told you before, but I loved you the very first time I saw you. There's one thing you can say about the marriage of Tim and Emily-- it started in bed. ** Back in college, Tim and his buddies spent weekend nights trying to pick up secretaries in the bars along the Boston Post Road. -Hey. -Hello. Raincoats, boys. Heaven forbid we knock one of these bimbos up. The guys called it "posting." Ah, the intoxicating scent of estrogen mixed with cheap perfume. Hello. -Hello. -Hey. -Hey. -Hey. Hello. Wow, twins. Emily never had any trouble spotting the college boys. They were the ones with ironed shirts. And, of course, they were terrible dancers. Virgin. Virgin. Jailbait. Come on, I bet she's never had a period before. You got to stop picking these virgins, man. You're never gonna get laid that way. Oh, boy. Ma√±ana, Tim-o. Tell Phayer we got a ride, okay? I don't bite. Oh, shit! Shit. Sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. So... how come no one's snatched up a pretty girl like you? You think I'm pretty? -Yeah. -Timmy, my boy. Miss, um... Jo Ann. Yes, Miss Jo Ann here, uh, doesn't have a ride home. You think you could, uh, catch a lift? Let's go already. I mean, I can come back and pick you up. I can give him a ride. I don't mind. Such a generous lass. If I don't show up in the morning, send in the Marines. Okay. He's funny. Yeah, yeah, he's... He's funny. You know, you don't look old enough to have your driver's license. I'm older than I look. I'm 26. I get my nursing degree this year. Well, you know what they say about nurses. Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Shit. That's okay. We can fix that. Ooh. Wait. Call me. Okay. Hey, Tim, Mrs. Tamberelli wants a tuna salad on rye toast, just shy of burnt and no crust. She'll absolutely die if there's even a speck of crust. You get laid last night? -Three times. -Welcome to the club, buddy. Yo, Lerner, guess who popped his cherry last night. -Ah. -Yeah, you know, we did it with her roommate right there on the other bed. Christ, what a slut. Yeah, you can say that again. You know, you should have nailed the roommate as well. Hey, no members in the kitchen, pal. Oh, how ironic-- I'm not allowed in, but riffraff like you run rampant. Say, uh, I don't suppose either of you bozos would want to join me for a set or two. You know, my trust fund just ran out. You! Word is you became a man last night. Ah, three times. Oh, making up for lost time, I see. Hey, you know, she was almost 26. Oh, a spinster, huh? Well, on the other hand, if you marry, you'll die around the same time. Women live longer than men. I'm not gonna marry her. Hey, did she, um... Did she do that little-- that little maneuver on you? Yeah? That's none of your fuckin' business. Oh, that means she did. Huh? It's fuckin' freezin'. Hey, quit hoggin' the scotch, Timmy boy. I hate the cold. I like it. Crewneck sweaters, cashmere scarves. It's like I just stepped off a Brooks Brothers catalogue or something. Hey, Jo Ann! Yeah, that's her. Hey, where's your fourth musketeer? Who, Phayer? I never see him around anymore. Oh, well, he's up at Yale, don't ya know. Yeah, but the Poz is always available. When they're your size, I throw 'em back. Ooh. Fuckin' broads. Ah, it's kind of weird with Phayer back at school. Weird? It's great! Phayer's around, you get a broad in bed, all she's thinkin' about is Phayer. I was thinking of writing a book-- "Living in Phayer's Wake," huh? Yeah, I think James Joyce got there first. Hey, pass that back. Hey. Yo, AnnMarie. -Hi. -Wait up. I'll see you guys. Hey, how do you know that's not my twin? 'Cause yours had the mustache. This fuckin' guy. Hey, isn't that your little nurse? Oh, yeah. Well, if you're not gonna dance with her... Hey, Vinny, let me get a Cutty on the rocks, huh? Make it a double. Bowwow, what a dog! Come on. At least part of you likes her. Yeah, well, my kid sister's got bigger tits. So what? You know what? Tits aren't everything. Okay, Mahatma Gandhi. There were so many reasons for Tim not to get involved. At 26, Emily was surely looking for a husband. Tim was terrified at how easily she'd taken him into her bed. And if he took things any further, would there be any going back? Hey. Want to dance? So, how'd you like my friend? Which one? Jon. Posnick, the guy with the leather jacket. Oh, he was all right. Kept trying to press his thing into me, though. I like your other friend. Which one? You know, the one with the gray hair. He's nice. Is he here tonight? Uh, he's back at-- oh, he got married. Really? You sound disappointed. No, just surprised. The Posnick taking the evening vapors. What the fuck are you doing here? Got out of econ early. And who can resist the clarion call of Hogan's? Yeah? Well, miss you, man. It's a lot easier wrangling chickies with you around, you know? Well, let's get to it. All right. ** I thought you were gonna call. Yeah, I was, but, you know, I just got busy gettin' back to school, and then I lost your number, so... Mind if I cut in? Your wife lets you go dancing? Uh, yeah, I told her you got married. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, it's-- Yeah, it's in the pre-nup. She has-- She gets unlimited pedicures, and I can go out with the guys on Friday nights. It's fantastic. Um... Well, don't let me disturb you. Oh... Go home to the wife. Like I said, I tried to find your number, but I didn't know your name. I'm Tim. I'm Emily. ** When Emily thinks of where their relationship began, it amuses her that Tim has turned into such a romantic. It's Tuesday night. What's with the candles? Lord, are you in bed already? No, I'm playing shortstop for the Yankees. It's 10 after 8:00, this is the time born-againers in Kansas go to sleep. I don't think what time you go to bed has anything to do with how chic you are. In Rio, they're just now getting dressed for dinner. I hate going to bed on a full stomach. Don't worry about the Brazilians. They work it off on top of the sheets, thongs halfway up their crotch. Unbelievable. 49 years together, and you're still talking about sex. Well, I can't do it anymore. No kidding. -More Dickens? -I told you, I'm gonna read every word he wrote before... you know. Better hurry, "Nickleby's" over a thousand pages. Could be touch and go. It was the mid-'60s. With the sexual revolution raging all about them, Tim and Emily were married and not long after had a child. Mommy, I can't sleep. Oh, sweetie, you scared me. I have a tickle right here. Good thing Mommy's a nurse. A "pediactress" nurse. That's right, in just two months, Mommy'll get her advanced degree to be a "pediactress" nurse. Taking care of cute little children just like you. Ahh. Well, no wonder you have a tickle. You have a little sore throat. This'll make it all better. All right, just go right up to bed. Mommy'll come kiss you good night. Go on. Marriage was turning out to be much more difficult than Emily had imagined. With Tim working late every night, she was lonely. Still, she was doing everything she could to bring out the warmth she knew was in there. Tim. -How was your day? -Don't ask. Jason has me line-editing Hilda's latest oeuvre. What a hack. -Oover? -Oh, Christ, Emily, "oeuvre." Oeuvre, it's French for an artist's body of work. I'm using it ironically. It's the biggest piece of shit I've ever read. -You hungry? -Goddamn weathermen. Not a drop-- Oh, damn it! Goddamn it. Well, next time they say it's gonna be sunny, you should pack an umbrella. Is that fish? -It's a surprise. -Oh, you know I hate fish. Well, you like fish sticks. And that's fish, kind of. Why don't you wash up? I'll go put Meg to bed. Could we please have one dinner where we look at each other? I thought you had to study for your anatomy final. Half an hour is all I'm asking for. Take some salad, I made the sour cream dressing you like. So it is fish. Yes, lemon sole, on special at King's. How much was it? Here, knock yourself out. Wow, $2.86. Unbelievable. You can get a whole pack of fish sticks for $0.70. What are you doing? Where are you going? It's too expensive. I'm gonna take it back. -You've already cooked it. -It's going back. All right, I'll eat it. I wouldn't want us going broke. Back in college, Tim had dreamed of girls who wrote poetry, played the violin, and here he was, married to a practical nurse. Emphasis on "practical." They wouldn't take it back, would they? They have a policy. Once you've cooked it-- Here you go, big spender. Oh, my God... Hey-- Every last one of your 286 cents! And if you don't believe me, you can get down on your hands and knees and count them! Hey, come here! Come on. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Hey, I'll get up. -No, I'm up. I'm up. I've got to get up anyway. I'm meeting the guys at the golf course at 7:30. -You're playing golf today? -We play every Saturday. I don't know, with Meg sick? You realize I worked over 60 hours this week? Okay. Okay, you're right, I'm being selfish. Just do me one favor. See if Raymond'll give you a ride. What's with Raymond all the time? Raymond lives down the block. How come you always call Jon and Ethan by their last names but Phayer's always "Raymond?" Goddamn it, just call him now. Mommy, I don't feel so good. I know, sweetie. It's just a nasty little cold. Phayer's already left for the golf course. Damn. From now on, could you please try to get a ride? I hate being without the car on weekends. You know what, I'll just stay home. No, go, I don't want you hanging around, looking miserable all day. I've got a briefcase full of manuscripts. Go. Me and Miss Margaret'll be fine. Won't we, sweetie? And how's my little princess? -My throat hurts. -Oh, no. What's 3 times 9? -27. -And 8 times 6? 48. Daddy, stop. Such a smart little girl. She's way ahead of other kids her age, isn't she? Go. Get out of here. All right. It's supposed to rain. You should take an umbrella. I'll be okay. What's 56 divided by 8? -7. -Unbelievable. I don't think it's gonna break. You keep saying it's gonna break. It's gonna break. Whoo. I do believe you've out-driven me for once, old boy. -Good one. -Fuckin' Cary Middlecoff here. Guys, we're never gonna get in 18. -We're going to kick your ass. -I wish you the best of luck. Come on, this is nuts. Yeah, but you and I will have a side bet. You should've brought your umbrella. Does Sheila pack you your umbrella these days? Don't tell me about Sheila. You're kidding me. Check it out. Same time next week? Yeah, but can one of you guys give me a lift? Emily's pissed that I left her without the car. You can count on me, "Timo-thee." See you punks later. Hey, anybody wanna grab a beer? Sheila's on the warpath. I got to take her to the cinema. Hey, great playin' today, Tim. For real. 25 bucks. Guess who kicked Phayer's butt. Excuse me, where's the emergency room? Okay, nice, deep breath. One more. I'm concerned about her breathing. Emily! Em, what's going on? Let the doctor speak. I'm afraid your daughter's having a severe asthma attack. -It's not bronchitis? -No, definitely not. -Why didn't you call me? -Any asthmatics in the family? Yes, his mother. We're gonna start her on a nebulizer. And then if her breathing doesn't improve, we'll give her a shot of adrenaline, all right? All right, you sit tight. I'm gonna get that set up. Hi, baby. How you feeling? Huh? Do you have $5? The nurse lent me the money to pay the cab driver. You took a cab? What did you want us to do, wait for the bus? I took 25 bucks from Phayer. Bully for you. How could you leave me alone with a sick child and no car? I don't see you all week, and then the first chance you get, you're off to play your fucking golf game. Sweetie? Sweetie, it's okay. Just relax. Nurse, Doctor, anyone, we have an emergency here! Hey, Meg? Hey, Meg, look at me, sweetie, look at me. You're gonna be fine, okay? Sir, please step back. Out of the way, please. You can't die from an asthma attack, can you? Of course you can. Especially if you're only four years old. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. Stop pacing. -What? What is it? -Everything's going to be fine. -Is she all right, is she-- -Let the doctor speak. The asthma has broken. Now, there's still a fair amount of congestion but the worst is over. She's gonna be all right. Oh, thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. Now, I do need to tell you, though, we lost her for just a little while there. Oh, my poor, poor baby. "Lost her," what do you mean? She actually stopped breathing for about 30 seconds. Now, with an attack this severe, that is not unusual. Look, the important thing is we got her through it, and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be just fine. "Pretty sure," what-- what does that mean? Brain damage, what? The brain can go quite some time without oxygen, Mr. Hanratty. Now, you two, you need to go home and get some sleep. Your daughter's going to be fine. If anything is wrong with that child... Emily, I'm home. Tim? I'm late for my anatomy exam. Can't you take a make-up exam? It's been 10 days. Meg's fine. Oh, hey. Are you fine, baby? -Yeah. -Are you fine? -Yeah. -So, after the exam, me and a couple of the girls are going out to Hogan's. "A couple of the girls and I..." Yes. All right. Night, sweetie. You be a good girl. There's a cold chicken in the fridge. -All right, kiss. -I'm late. Mommy's-- Mommy's going to take a test, just like the ones I give you. What's 4 times 6? I don't like that game anymore. Oh, sh... Em, are you awake? Emily? As troubling memories of the past began to roil Tim's sleep, he turned, as he always did, to Emily's body. Even after all their years together, he never stopped loving her scent, the feel of her skin. Some of you might think it's not sex, but it's not... not sex, either. I'm asleep! The Swinging '70s. Tim was promoted to editor-in-chief, with only one person to report to-- the legendary publisher Oscar Dystel. Yeah? Anything you need before I go? Not really. Uh, any calls? Dr. Snider's office. Your tests are in. They want you to call in the morning. Did they say anything else? Just to call in the morning. -Okay, um-- -Henry. How are you coming with "Spirited Cooking"? Uh, I'm drawing a blank here. "Spirited Cooking." 200 fun-filled alcohol-based recipes. It's young Helayne's project. The manuscript is a hoot. Truthfully, I've been so busy getting Mary's novel ready to launch-- Look, I know a new Chaneau novel is a big deal, but it's the "how-to" books that pay the rent. There are 45 million alcoholics in this country, every single one of them looking for more ways to sneak booze into their gut-- Hmm? Helayne, I thought I killed that stupid food-for-alcoholics book. Oops. -You gonna fire me? -I should. What'd you do, slip it into his briefcase? No. I just dangle these whenever I hear him coming back from one of his many trips to the men's room. Jesus Christ! Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Give you an update on "Spirited Cooking." You are unbelievable. Sorry to barge in on you like this. Only way to get hold of a doctor these days is if he's in your foursome. Take a real deep breath for me, Bryce. Things were going well for Emily too. She's been made head of her department. Clear as a bell, Raymond. I would suggest you take him home, give him a baby aspirin, and put him to bed. How can we ever thank you? This lad's got so much to live for. Shut up. Hey, how's Miranda? At an orthodontist convention in Scottsdale. Staying an extra week to get in a little golf. Hey, I've got an idea. How about Bryce and I take you and Meg to dinner? Double date. Hmm. Tim's working late, so... why not? I'll go change. But you look so good in a nurse's uniform. You know what they say about nurses. Hey, sweetie, did Daddy call? How should I know? Guess what. Raymond Phayer and his cute, little son Bryce are gonna take us out to dinner. Ugh! Yuck! -Oh, come on. It'll be fun. -For who? We'll go out for pizza. I hate pizza. Fine. Suit yourself. You want to come up for a drink? Make you my special Brandy Alexander. On top of the two martinis? Who knows what'll happen. Nah, I, uh... I got to haul ass, or I'm gonna miss the last train. Stay over. I don't think that's a good idea. Au contraire, it's the perfect idea. You don't waste two hours of your life commuting, you get in early, impress the shit out of Oscar. He'd love that-- me sleeping with the only editor he's got his eye on. Not with or atop or on or in. Merely at one of your editor's. The lady knows her prepositions. Good night. Comme les fran√ßais. ** Night, sweetie. I thought you'd be home at the regular time. You scared me. -I was worried. -I'm sorry, I, uh... I was literally out the door when Chaneau comes storming in wanting to go over every one of my edits. When we finally surfaced for air, it was after 11:00. You could have called. I lost all track of time. Well... you must be starving. Want me to make you an omelet? We ordered in Chinese. How about you and Meg? What'd you do for dinner? Oh, we just ordered in pizza. For the first time in their marriage... they lied to each other. Everything okay with Meg? Actually, no. -What's the matter? -She finally got her period. Well, isn't that a good thing? In school this morning. Oh. Well, at least she got it. Apparently, she was trailing droplets of blood throughout the cafeteria before a gym teacher brought it to her attention. -Oh, God. -She came home in tears. Poor kid. She's so fucking sensitive. She's just gonna have to toughen up is all. Bye, Daddy. Hey. What-- What the hell? -Oh, God... -Oh, no. Who did that? Hey! Come back here! Hey! Hey, Eddie... I know your mother. -Daddy, don't. -No, it's just-- Hey, excuse me. My daughter just got her... Never mind. Oh, baby. I love you so much. That's what you got to think about, okay? When shit like this happens, "Daddy loves me." I don't want to go to school today. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You got to go. You got to go. Hey, remember what my... my soccer coach used to say? Don't let... Don't let the bastards get you down? Yeah, don't let the bastards get you down. Don't let the bastards get you down. Don't let the bastards get you down, yes! Don't let the bastards get you down! Fuck. We found a little lesion right here and nowhere else. The important thing is, your Gleason score is low -- 6.2. That's good? Yeah, 6.2 means it's not a very aggressive tumor. So what I'm gonna recommend is that we just watch and wait. No need for surgery. At least for now. So, let him watch cartoons for an hour, and then read him "Pat the Bunny." Always gets him straight to sleep. "Pat the Bunny"? I read "Pat the Bunny" to Meg when she was a year and a half. Yes, well... Em, come on. We're late. And this is his bottle and his diapers. Diapers? Boom-boom here is a bit of a late bloomer. Uh-huh. I'm ready. Oh, wow. -You know Mary Chaneau. -Wait a second. -You're Mary Chaneau's editor? -Yeah. Well, in New York. Ellen Crutchfield in London. Well, the next time you see her, you can tell her from me that lesbianism so infuses her work, it's like she's selling it. If you knew Mary, you'd know that that's-- Come on. I want to dance. Yeah... in a minute. I-- I need to explain something to Sarah. Look, if-- if it's not on the page, it doesn't matter. No, I totally understand that. I know. I-- I'm just saying that there are a lot of overtones of lesbianism. Sure, but if you didn't know she was a lesbian, -it wouldn't inform-- -I know, but I-- I do know. So, now, how can I not know? It wouldn't inform, you know, your opinion in this way. -I completely disagree. -Well... -I mean-- -You can disagree all you want. Every chick in her last book is either wearing a lumber jacket or slipping into a pair of Birkenstocks. Oh, Tim... Tim, for Christ's sake, I'm asleep. Tim, don't. You're crazy. You're soaking wet. You're so hot. Such a little whore. Don't think I don't know who you're thinking about. Voil√†. Page 37. Chou-fleur en Chablis. Join me. It's delicious. Now I know how to get you drunk. Hey, sweetie. How was your day? I assume you finished all of your homework. Daddy called. He says he has to work late, not to wait up. Huh. I'm going out for a few hours. That's not a fanfare. And now the pi√®ce de la r√©sistance. Very nice. Mmm. Very good. I shouldn't do this. It'll be our little secret. Is everything okay? Oh, no, actually. What's up? I seem to be having a little bit of a prostate issue. It's a hell of a dessert. Ray, what's a six-letter word for a lake in Siberia? I have a house on Lake Hopatcong. I saw on the bulletin board that you have folk dancing at night. I drive an Olds. A '98. I remember, '98s were beautiful. -Since when do you know about cars? Miranda was born in Minneapolis. She's adopted. The man is totally out of it. That's a terrible thing to say. You were the handsomest of all the men, Raymond. The best-looking of all. You take care, Raymond. We're going home tomorrow. Good-bye now, Raymond. We'll see you next week. When you said he was the handsomest, did you mean better than me? Of course not, you're the handsomest. Ah, I bet way back when, there was something going on between you two. You're an idiot. Uh, no, it's... Oh, my apologies. I'm sorry. -Thank you. -Here's the salad. Please... enjoy your meal. -Oh, yes. -Thank you. Oh, he's adorable. Emily! Em! Wake up! Come on! Christ's sakes, what is it now? Sit up! I want you to look at me! You always do this to me. I have the most amazing idea. -You're crazy. -Not just me, the two of us. The breathing will improve, it's just a phase. No, it's not just the breathing, you idiot. It's everything. No golf, no sex life, no friends left, no one to illustrate my books. What about Levenstein? Levenstein died last November, for Christ's sake. There are lots of young artists who would love to work with you. Nobody wants to work with an old man. What about my headaches? Do you hear me complain? If life doesn't give you exactly what you want, you want to take your ball and go home? And what's worse, you want to take me with you? Only if you want. Well, I don't. Helayne? You wanted to see me? Tim! Come on in. I hope this won't take too long. As you know, Emile is being operated on as we speak. Won't take a minute. We're retiring you. What? Just like that? This is so sudden. I mean, what about all the manuscripts I'm working on? I've given them to the younger editors. It's your time to enjoy. Enjoy? I enjoy editing. It's all I enjoy. Take up bridge. You and Emile learn how to tango. Well, what about... my own imprint? It doesn't have to be big. One or two novels a year. Look, Tim, H.R. has put together a great disengagement package, hmm? With Social and Medicare, you'll be fine. Decent fiction is still important, Helayne. Hasn't earned its keep in this house in years. Well, if I'm gonna go, then I'm gonna take Mary with me. No one under 40 knows who she is anyway. Think of it this way. Now you'll have time to concentrate on your own writing. Funny little cash register books, they sell. Funny, I-- I started working on one when you took over last fall. "88 Ways to Bring Down Your Boss." -Funny. -Make me an offer. I'll be happy to look at a completed manuscript. Look, I've got a meeting with Bresna. Remember all those years ago when you had me up to your place? Wined me and dined me and tried to get me to go to bed with you. Yes. Boy, am I glad I didn't go along with that. Why? Maybe if you had, you'd still have a job. It was 1989. Boom times were over. Tim had to have his prostate removed, and three weeks later, lost his job, which gave him plenty of time to help Em recover from heart surgery. Here we go. Your chamomile tea. My God. I heated the milk. Almond butter. All this niceness is scaring me. Why? You did it for me. Yeah, but for me it's easy. I'm a nurse. You know, it just... makes us even, I guess. You don't have a prostate and... I've got a pig's valve in my left ventricle. Don't start oinking at me. You can go back to work, you know. Honey, it's been five weeks. You stay out too much longer, they'll forget who you are. Well, we'll see. Maybe it was their newly empty nest, or maybe just old-fashioned need, but Tim and Em began to take a deeper comfort in each other's company. Want to see it? Want to see what? Wow. That looks amazing. -Really? -Yeah. It really doesn't look bad at all. It's... it's kind of sexy. Oh, shut up. Well... Is it okay to be in the sun? It's vitamin D, baby. What could be bad about that? What's the worst thing you can hear when you're blowing Willie Nelson? Um... I'm not really Willie Nelson. I'm actually Bea Arthur. Oh... wow. "Dear Emile, "hope you are feeling better. "Miranda and I send our best wishes "for a speedy recovery. "I know it's last minute, but it would be our pleasure to have you and Tim..." That's nice. "...join us for a casual dinner at our club. Love, Raymond and Miranda." At their club? La-di-da. I knew that was him in the bushes. Oh, my God, he saw my scar! "Oh, my God, he saw my scar!" -Give me a break. -Would you get out of here? I'm losing all the steam. Are you up to it? Raymond's club? Are you kidding me? -Close the door! -Okay! ** Um, hello. I'm standing here. You look great. -Oh, God! -Answer it. -It's Meg. -You don't know. Well, who else is gonna call us on a Saturday while we're going out? Hello? Hi, sweetie. Hi. How's everything up in Boston? Uh-huh. Anything going on tonight? I am not prying. I'm just making conversation. Shut up. Uh-huh. Uh, yeah. Let me see if I can find him. Actually, uh, you know what? I think he's down in the car. Yeah, we're going to this big thing at, uh... He's not standing two feet away from me, I swear. You know what? Actually-- Oh, wait, I think I heard him in the kitchen. Let me just call him. Tim, Meg is on the phone! Hi, sweetie. No, Dad's not a secret bitch. He just cares about you very much. Oh, you... You've met somebody. That's wonderful. Well, so what if he's not age-appropriate. Well, an older man can love you just as well as a... Oh, he's younger. How younger? And about seven years later, she had a mitral valve replacement, and the amazing thing is-- Okay, here's Mom, she's 89 years old. Athena, can-- can we please talk about something besides heart conditions? -Oh, thank you. -Oh, sorry. It's okay. I'd like to propose a toast. To our gang of eight. Back together again happily. Hear, hear. Now that we have our captain, our champion, our... knight in shining armor, back with us all healthy and healed, his radiant self once again. Hear, hear. -Hear, hear. -Hear, hear. Thank you, Raymond. Thank you. -Cheers, to Emile. -To Emile. Didn't we clink glasses at the beginning of the meal? Darling, at this age, one can't clink glasses often enough. So, Raymond... what do you think of Emile's scar? Um... I don't know quite what you mean, old chum. Well, I think it's healing beautifully, don't you? -Timothy. -I love a man with a scar. Oh, for Christ's sake, Raymond. What, you don't think I saw you hiding in the rhododendrons? You mean the Japanese maple. Oh. Em, I didn't even see a scar. Well, what do you want? Who's sexier than Emile? Uh, Pee-wee Herman. Oh, come on! With these legs, are you crazy? You have the best hair. You still have that great body. I mean, you look really good. I second that emotion. -To Emile. -To Emile. Well, I guess at this age you can't clink enough. That's right. -Speech. -Speech. -Really? -Speech. -Speech. -Speech. Well... I, um... I just want to say it's a funny time, you know, at this stage of our lives. The eight of us... Oh, my God, we go way back, don't we. I mean, we used to be so young and good-looking, and now cancer... diabetes... Fucking stents. Yeah. It's like dodging bullets, isn't it? I mean... The only thing that makes it bearable is that we're all here for each other. You all make me feel more loved than... my own parents ever did. I keep telling him he's gonna outlive me by a hundred years. If Sheila outlives me, the first thing she's gonna do is have sex with my billionaire brother. Oh, come on! I most definitely will. -Wow. -That's a good idea. Woodward and Bernstein said, "Follow the money, honey." Who can argue with that? I hope that Sarah finds someone after I'm gone. I just want her to be happy. Oh, my God. How wimpy can you get? Where are you going? Well, I have something that might cheer us all up. It would appear that our Bryce and your Meg -have become an item. -Wow! -What? -All in the family. Meg and Bryce? Meg is 12 years older than Bryce. That's supposed to cheer us up? Tim always hates it that I kiss everybody on the lips, but from now on I'm kissing each one of you every time we're together. -I love you. -I love you too. Don't be such a hater. -I love you. -Love you. Raymond, it was a lovely evening. You are so generous. -Oh, yeah. -Thank you so much. We're happy to have you back. Thank you. Can we leave, already? Just saying good-bye. Tim still found himself wrestling with jealousy. He rationalized perhaps every couple has a Raymond Phayer in their life. Didn't Freud say intercourse is a union of four people? The two doing it, the two they're thinking about. -All right, what's bugging you? -Nothing. I'm fine. "Thank you for such a lovely evening, Raymond. Can I suck your cock now?" Oh, come on. Please don't start this again. Well, you always say you're not attracted to him. Could have fooled me. -Why? Because I'm nice to him? -'Cause you flirt with him. Maybe 'cause he does things like throw dinner parties for us. He wants to get in your pants. God, you are a full-fledged paranoid. Well, he's a closet case. We both know that. -And Miranda should get tested. -Stop it. I'll bet he told his idiot son to hit on Meg just to spend more time with you. They've been friends since they were children. I know he's a bit younger than her. I actually think Bryce is retarded. He is somebody, okay? I mean, she's-- she's almost 30 years old, she's never had a boyfriend. He looks like he could be her son. I can't bear her being alone anymore. I can't stand it. What are you working on? Hmm? Haven't seen you working in your notebooks for ages. Mm. Which one is it? Helayne giving you a hard time again? I have to tell you something. What? She fired me. Oh, my God. When? The day you were operated on. You've been keeping this from me for a month? She called me in, 8:00 a.m. I said, "Emile's being operated on today." And she said, "Oh, this'll only take a minute." I thought I was getting a midyear bonus for the Balkan states book. Go figure. Oh, honey. Come here. No, I don't want to be hugged for getting shit-canned. She couldn't carry your shoes. Not as an editor, no, but she's a much better in-fighter. Yeah, well, you never were a very good fighter. I always wanted to be, I just... guess I don't have the stomach for it. That's what I love about you. You're not a fighter. Most men, that's all they wanna do. I'm okay. You sure you want to do this right now? Mm-hmm. I'm not really feeling it so much. You will. What about your heart? Isn't it too soon? Look, I don't see the cardiologist till Wednesday. That gives us four days to fuck our brains out. Okay. But you have to promise me one thing. What? Stop pretending I'm Raymond. Oh, Raymond... Shit. That feels good. So good. And what about Meg? -Here comes the guilt trip. -She has issues. How do you think she'll feel knowing her own father doesn't love her enough to stay alive? Oh, now she has issues. Last week she was just "quirky," like a TV character. And what about Riley? Starting fullback and only a sophomore? -Well, what about him? -We're supposed to go see him play a Thanksgiving day game, we already have tickets. Flying 2,500 miles to see a high school football game in fucking December? Last time I looked, Thanksgiving was in fucking November. It was now 1997. What a dump, Emily. I didn't think it was so bad. My bed vibrated. My bed sagged. Such a positive attitude. Tim and Em were both retired and for the last several years raising their grandson, Riley. Why the hell we couldn't stay at the Marriott like everyone else I'll never understand. Dad, because Bryce can't see the dress. It's bad luck. Well, plenty of that to go around. Hush up, Tim. No-no-no-no-no-no, you let me get in first. Then you come in, okay? Yes, yes-yes. I want to sit on Mommy's lap. If you sit on Mommy's lap, you'll crush her beautiful dress. I want to sit on Mommy's lap now. Tim, stop him. Riley. I don't like you anymore, Grandma. I wanted to sit on Mommy's lap. Riley, that's not nice. In my day, we used to get married first and then have the kid. Dad, shut up. This is my day. I wish you would just get into the spirit of things. I'm trying, baby. I'm trying. Where Raymond gets his money... Oh, he inherited it. And if that weren't enough, he married an orthodontist. Well, I think it's very generous of them. I mean, it's usually the bride's family that... Well, if we were paying for it, Meg, we'd have to work for the rest of our lives. And you must be the Hanrattys. Hi, Mom and Dad, this is Valerie, the wedding planner. Nice to meet you. -You look lovely. -Thank you. -Are we early? -No, no, don't be silly. Meg, why don't you come with me up to hair and makeup? -Okay. -And you can just... hang out wherever you want. I could use a drink. There's a bar around the corner. Okay, come on, Riley. Grandpa'll buy you a soda. I want to be with Mommy. Oh, okay, it's okay, Dad, it's okay. -It's your day, sweetie. -It's all right. Going up to hair and makeup. You're gonna sit quietly with Mommy. That kid has an Oedipus complex. Thank you, Dr. Spock. Careful. You don't want to get drunk at your only child's wedding. That's precisely what I do want. You're crazy, you know that? This should be the happiest day of your life. Can I have another scotch, please? Make that a double. What? I'm Irish. You're an idiot is what you are. I can just see Posnick and Lerner as the "young" couple come walking down the aisle. "He's marrying his fuckin' mother!" Oh, they will not! Believe me, I know those guys. Absolutely not. It's such a godawful compromise, Emily. Oh, please, everything's a compromise. That's what life is. He's a major pothead. She's twice his age. So? Lots of women marry younger men. -20 years? -12. And what difference does it make? They love each other. No, Emily, they need each other. And we didn't. * You okay, baby? I'm great. Okay. Then I'm great too. Wasn't it ironic, that with all the young men in the world, Meg had to pick Phayer's kid? Now Raymond would be in their life more than ever. Something funny, guys? What's so funny? Dearly beloved, please be seated. Why is Grandpa crying? Because he is so happy for Mommy and Daddy and you. -I want Mommy. -Not now, sweetheart. -Dearly beloved... -Oh, Jesus, come back! It's okay, Dad, I don't mind. Aww. All right, everybody, all right. Now, our lovely bride and her handsome father are going to dance for us to a very special tune. Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I've been such a pill to you. It's okay, Dad. I don't know, I just get so anxious sometimes. Riley. The job situation. -The age difference... -Shh. Everything's going to be okay. Okay. And now the handsome groom and his beautiful mother. It is such a beautiful day. And Meg is such a beautiful bride. Bryce looks so handsome in his tuxedo. So dignified. -Grandpa? -Hmm? Yep? I need to make a poo-poo. Okay. His daughter's wedding had Tim thinking about his first night with Emily. Had it been the same with Meg and Bryce? After all, bed hadn't been a bad place to begin. -Wipe me, Grandpa! -Mm-kay. Get in the wiping position. Wow, that's a man-sized poo-poo for such a little boy. Where's Daddy? Over there. Where's Mommy? Right there. Where's Grandma "Em-ah-ree"? Um... She's with Grandpa Ray. Yeah. Grandpa Ray. Don't you guys play something people can dance to? People are dancing. No, I mean something... You know, something fast. We're just playing what the bride wanted, Mister. Well, I'm the father of the bride, and I'm requesting something high-energy. How about, uh... "Rock Around The Clock" or something like that? Don't know it. What about "U Can't Touch This"? Touch what? What about "Push It"? "Push it"?! There's this song we play at Jewish weddings. It gets everybody up and moving. It goes "Da-da da-da-da..." Da-da da-da-da... Sure, play that, play that. Ahh, Riley, this is going to be interesting. Raymond Phayer knows how to make you feel at home. Let's go, boys! I always thought Phayer had a little Jew in him. Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila, ve-nis'mecha! Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila, ve-nis'mecha! Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila, ve-nis'mecha! Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila, ve-nis'mecha! Hey! Obsessed with his and Emily's ending it together, Tim combed through local cemeteries looking for couples who had passed at the same time. He didn't find one. He shuddered at the idea of living on without Em, and he certainly didn't want her living on without him. It wouldn't be long before she found someone new. Wouldn't it be romantic, then? Stepping into the great unknown together? If you're gonna off yourself, you're gonna have to do it alone. Emily? Em? Oh, Jesus! ** I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem like she's gonna come out. I'm so sorry, sir. She's resting comfortably now. Are you comfy? Tim... this is it. Oh, come on. All the women in your family lived well in their nineties. Well, you always said you wanted to have sex... with other girls. Who would have me? And if they would, I don't think I could. You've never been with anyone... but me, have you? Have you? You're the only one. Have you? Raymond? It never meant anything to me. Okay, you don't have to be telling me this, I... it doesn't matter, I don't care. Just tying up loose ends. Where are the pills? Em, no. This way, we won't use up Meg's inheritance. ** Married so many years now, and, for so much of that time, believing they'd had a choice. Emily. Everything is going to be okay. I promise you. Never realizing that, the moment they locked eyes, that was it. Yes, even with all the hurt and the pain they'd caused each other, it had to be. And now... neither would change a thing. You know, baby, I don't think I ever told you before, but the first time I saw you... I loved you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Em. Don't leave me, don't leave me. It's not supposed to happen this way. Em? I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there with you. Oh... I... God. ** * Do, do, do * Do, do, do * I see lilacs in the rain Like I said, uh, you know, I tried to find your number, but... I didn't know your name, so... I'm Tim. I'm Emily. * In my heart * Do, do, do * Do, do, do * When we parted in the lane * The skies were tearful with rain * * The scent of lilacs remained in my heart * * Two other arms around you now... ** **
