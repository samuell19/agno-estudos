You know the new guy The cute one? He's way too young for you and will probably quit in a few months You think? He's totally absorbed I like watching a soap opera You were like that in your first week Was l? What's with the sunglasses? I heard he has an eye condition Is that right? What a pity!

Toward Sumi, of course My dear Sumi Then suddenly her outstretched hand and her mouth started moving in slow motion Not just her but my mom, dad and my little sister, too I gotta run to Sumi and touch her hand but my body kept leaning to a side How many fingers? Two and three It's like this What it is is... That's right. Faster! This, this and this Bird This way I've only read about it in the book Dynamic Visual Acuity, i.e. the ability to see moving objects He has an exceptionally acute vision in that area Not all the time but only when he intentionally focuses on something I did look at Sumi with enormous concentration Every day, a lot You should make him play baseball He looks at the ball, it slows down He'll hit every ball Like in slow motion, you know? Your kid has that function incorporated in his system How? Like this Strike! Like so Why do I fall when I run? Because it makes you feel diZZy When he runs his eyes will automatically adjust to focus Your brain registers that you're running But the visual information gathered through the eyes slows down So, it confuses the hell out of the brain Messing it up completely It won't be as bad when riding a bike or a car So I guess no baseball for him In other words, he can't run because his eyes are too good Let's watch his progress In the mean while you might get diZZy easily if it's too bright Dad reassured me that everything will be fine He went to a faraway country to make money to fix my eyes I was sad that dad had to go away because of my eyes but it wasn't always so bad Things I saw in slow motion were so remarkable They inspired my artistically What's with the shades? - The kids thought I had freak eyes - Freak! Like this or like this Sumi was the only one willing to be my friend The spring has finally come to my life Inspirations, too But hanging out with me she became an outcast, too The spring was short If I could run I never would've let her drift away I can't run because my eyes are too good Is he gonna kiss her? Now? Hey! What's wrong with him? I watched television closely to damage my eyes But the soap operas were so good They had a lot of really cool men I learned everything from them Like, how to talk Can I smell your scent? How to act I thought I could have you if I did this Even though I had no use for what I learned I rarely left the house except for biannual eye check-ups I had no visitors or any friends to meet outside My bang is a perfection today This tiny room became my entire world Dad never came home for holidays to save the airfare He had an accident and died on the job Now the only adult male I know is my ophthalmologist Jangbu, let's give it a serious thought this time I need to get out there before it's too late The world is calling my name SLOW VIDEO I got curious about people Not the ones on TV but the real people Watching from here their lives are much like the TV shows The difference is that there is no set script There are no supporting actors Everyone's a protagonist in all 200 TV series It can never get boring When the night falls all the busy people vanish and the lonely ones emerge onto the street This kid who pushes his cart up the hill everyday And this guy who plays ball alone every night He looks lonely I could keep him company Will he mind? I don't think he has any friends He rarely talks Only to me when he does He talks to you I have a professional approach Plus, I'm like a brother figure to him So, he must feel more comfortable I see He's the first male employee we've had in months Look out for him, Dr. Bang Don't worry I think of him as my successor I'll take a good care of him for the rest of my term Ball! Ball! What the heck? Acting like a social misfit Hey, doc Wait What on earth is he up to? He didn't throw anything Pretend you didn't see anything Just ignore him and go to your desk Don't look at him You must be tired It's been a long day for me 1 3, 1 4, 1 5,... 1 7, 1 8, 1 9, 20, 21 I don't think that our lives are any different from soap opera It's nice working here with all these screens, isn't it? With all the channels to choose from Eventually, you end up with your favorite channels I'll share the information eventually Old man Let's give it some time, shall we?

It's all in the first impression Gotta play hard Old man Where do you usually go? Just in-general Sorry? Me? See? It's all in the first impression Well, you know... Just... Market Mom's favorite bakery Bathhouse Sister's school What's missing? Girlfriend! Do you have a girlfriend? Where's her house? Isn't girlfriend something only the cool men on TV can have? There is someone that comes to mind, too Are you going somewhere? The weather's beautiful at the moment You can't fight the urge to be in the nature in fall She was always with the sunshine Hey! What are you doing here? Your interest... I'm already giving you every cent I get from my tenant So, why not pay us directly? I was just giving her the account number I'm sorry about this It's nothing to worry about It doesn't matter who I pay I just don't want any trouble I'm sorry Do you have to come this freaking early to harass me? I know things are hard for you I was just gonna do my job quietly then go Why are you going this early? Even your sleep is pretty Hey! I'm talking to you dear customer You're barely paying back the interest Sell the house and pay off all your debts Your father was so thoughtful as to leave this house along with his debt What the hell is your problem? Are you a goddamn shadow? Do you know this woman? Maybe She's in the sun The address is the same Did you borrow from someone else? What the hell are you staring at? Watch what you're looking at Sumi! - Or not - Hear me out, will ya? We got to see the same things It's the boy from the screen It's the first time meeting him in person Do you know that you're the earliest to rise in this town? Good to meet you, man I watch you every day It's the baseball guy I'm so happy to see him How can I express my excitement? Was it a ball? Psycho!

It's all about the line The first thing you say when you hand her the umbrella Chicks dig that kind of stuff Take your cue from me and she'll be yours in no time Stop following me In the rain there you stand What the...? Who is this creep? Pervert! Sumi was a good runner, too She ran the relay every year Maybe we went too far with the line Girls are complex Even for someone with a Ph. D. I know another man with a Ph.D. It was all about flowers in my days But these days... Well, I know all about the eyes No, I think you have a valid point What do you need flowers for? Commencement ceremony What else? Graduation Right? And yet Flower shops open every day Isn't that amaZing? Who would buy flowers for whom? Ha! Their logic is impeccable Are you sure about this, mom? Hair is my career of 20 years Girls love this style I don't think so She's the last one Hello? Hi!

It's not the 80's If you want to give me something I prefer a box of noodles And for what it's worth get rid of those shades They make you look all the more creepy Sumi Bong! It's me, Jangbu So, that's why Isn't it some fascinating coincidence? But my name is Sumi Oh It wasn't because of the hair... Was it? She liked the hair, right? It's all on you, mom You wouldn't have done that to a paying customer She's Sumi alright A 'Sumi Oh' not 'Bong' My Sumi couldn't have grown up to be that pretty She wasn't pretty at all I really tried hard to make her look pretty Aren't you going to work?
