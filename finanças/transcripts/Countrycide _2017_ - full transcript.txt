Dammit! Keep moving. Oh god! Now what? Ah, what about those travel games we brought? - Why don't you pull those out? - Hmm. Um... Um... I don't think these were designed for the driver to be playing too? What! Come on. Ugh. I suspect these were meant to distract kids, on long drives. What kind of games do you have for distracting drivers? I'm not sure drivers should be distracted. We should have brought those trivia games. You could ask me questions while we drove. - Crossword puzzle? - You have one? - Awesome, let's do it. - Alright. Can you take a look to see what we have to do next? Oh! We on this stretch of road, for at least another two hours. - I'm gonna need a break soon. - That's OK. You can break whenever you like. - That's the plan remember. - Yeah... yeah. Sorry I don't drive. Why don't you drive? Everybody drives. People don't believe me, it's sounds weird but it's true. When I was a kid, my friends and I were interested in cars. There was an old drive-in movie theater, about a mile from my house, and we used to dream about being old enough to get our driving licenses so that we could go there without our parents. But the drive-in closed and... we all started doing other things. Driving just never came up again. Next thing you know, I'm in my 20's, and I don't have a license. It's not too late? I didn't say I was never going to get my license. I Just don't have it now, when it would be very convenient. Sorry. I know it must be tiring being the only driver on a long trip. It's exhausting! But... we are saving a bundle on travel, so! Well say the word, and I'll start looking for a place to camp out for the night. - Start looking. - OK. Thanks for doing this, by the way. What! Don't even sweat it. I love an adventure. The bridesmaid dress my sister had me buy, was crazy expensive. Flying to her wedding would have wiped me out. Well, ah... Thank you... for making me your plus one. You too good to me Mike. Nah. There's a ranger's station about twenty minutes away. We can ask there about camping options? You direct us and I shall get us there. Where the heck are we? Better I don't tell you, so you don't get too discouraged. We still have about two thirds of the trip to go. You know what... it's all good. I'm having a great time. So... nice hanging out with you. Well I hope you feel that when the whole trip is done? Well... Just don't eat anything that makes you too gassy! - Let's go in. - OK. - I hope they have a washroom? - They have to have a washroom! I'm sure it's requirement or something. I don't see anyone? Hope this isn't one of those unmanned rest stops? Massive ranger station, so... worst comes to worst, we could look in a brochure or something. But ranger station implies there is a ranger! There is! Oh my God! Sorry I did not mean to spook you. That's OK. I don't get a lot of people coming through here and... I was taking a nap. We sorry to wake you. You don't have to apologize for me, not being at my post. I normally have a bell above the door that... Well, never mind. What can I do for you folks? We've been driving a really long time. We were just thinking about finding a place to camp? Well, if you think you can drive for another hour, there's a bunch of motels up by the highway. We'd rather not. I've been driving a long time. I'm the only one who drives and my eyes are really tired from the road. You don't drive? It's a long story. Plus we are trying to save on hotel costs. We traveling across the country to get to a wedding. Yeah, sure. Well... we do have camping permits. How long were you thinking of staying? Just overnight. I got to warn you though, we don't get a lot of people through here. So it's not as well maintained as some of the more touristy spots that you might find on your trip. That's totally fine, we just need a place to crash. OK, that we can do for you. What you want to do, is go back to the road. On the other side, you'll see an arrow. Follow that until you come to a fork, take the left side. You'll see a place to park. And after that, the whole forest is your campground. Huh. When you say you don't get a lot of people around here... You're it! I think you the only campers we've had in over a year. Seriously? Seriously. When the big highway went in, people stopped coming. Good thing you don't get paid per visitor. No offense. Don't worry about it. I'm technically a government employee, and I have seniority, so I'm fine either way. Yeah. Well, thanks a lot. And how much do we owe you? Don't worry about it. You kids just have fun. - Oh? - Are you sure? Will you get into trouble? If I told them I had campers, they wouldn't believe me anyway. - Well thanks again. - Be smart out there. Don't leave food out, in case of animals. - Will do. See ya. - Thanks. Have a good one. This is nice. It's the forest! Of course it's nice. You know what I mean! Pop the trunk, I'll grab our things. Just grab what you need. Travel light, that way, we can take a bit of a hike. - I thought you were tired? - Well... Well, my eyes are tired, but... Don't mind stretching my legs a bit. - Take in a bit of nature? - At least it's still early. You got it! Let's have some good natured fun. Ugh, very funny. ...I spit on a guy who is trying to date my mom... That is actually mean. I wouldn't spit on anyone else, just this guy. I swear, he is really bad news. ...bad news. Do you know what he should've got instead? He should've got a hippopotamus. Ahh... Ok. What's that? - What about this? - Nice. Yeah right. For our camping spot? It's a little far from the car. Yeah, but it's a nice spot. A bit of clearing, a little bit of shade. Sure, I suppose. Are you going to remember where we parked, when you wake up in the morning? Course I will. I'm the master tracker. Huh, course you are. Yeah. Now watch as the master sets up some shelter. Yeah. Hey, Abby... there's something I want to talk to you about. Oh, oh. Oh no. No, no, nothing bad. I want to thank you again, for bringing me along to your sister's wedding. Of course. I mean, I know I'm your plus-one and not technically your boyfriend or anything... What do you mean? Well... I really enjoy your company and... that's why I wanted to come along on this trip with you. No. What do you mean, you aren't really my boyfriend? Huh? Well... we spend almost all our time together. I mean, you've met my parents, who like you, by the way. And... you came along with me on this trip, with no questions asked. I'd say you are, indeed, my boyfriend. Hmm... but we never formally... I don't think that's necessary, is it? Jeez! I already told all my friends you were my boyfriend. - You serious? - Yes. Oh no, you weren't just about to let me down easy, were you? What? No! No! No. I was... just going to ask you... you know... wanted to be my girlfriend, or something? Oh yes! Sure, of course. Oh... good. Weird, I didn't think it would go down like this. I think we should probably kiss now. Ah... how long ago did you tell all your friends that I was your boyfriend? Three months ago. Well, happy three month anniversary. - Let's get this tent up. - Right. How you doing? - I'm alright. - You comfy? It's not the most uncomfortable I've ever been. Should have brought those lawn chairs. No, no. You wanted to hike a bit? They would have been, a pain to carry. Well, maybe we should have camped closer to the car, like you wanted? Mike it's fine! Don't worry about it. I'm having a good time. Would you be happier if I got the chairs? If you would be happier with a chair, that's up to you. I'm actually tired from hiking and the drive. I might not be able to keep my eyes open much longer. I should go get those chairs. Mike, don't worry about it. The snacks are in the car too. Oh. That's different. Mike, don't go. It's dark and you don't know these woods well enough to do it. Look, I'm just kidding. OK. I am not going to go to the car. I'm just going to check the woods, take care of a little business, if you know what I mean? - Promise? - Promise. I'll be back before you know it. Mike? Mike? Dammit Mike, I told you not to go to the car! Where the hell is the car anyway? Dammit! Mike? Mike? Where are you? Mike? Mike? Mike! Mike? Mike? Help! Mike? Where is it? Abby. It's me. Mike? Mike, thank god! You have to be careful, Abby, There's a wolf nearby. I heard it, I think it's been following me. I know. But it's OK now, I'm going to get you out of here. I'm so tired. I know you are Abby, but you have to stay awake. If you don't, the wolf will come back. Where've you been, Mike? I wanted to do something romantic for you, but... I got lost. But it's alright, I'm here now. I found you, and I'm never going to leave you again. My leg's really messed up. I can barely walk. I don't know how much longer I can make it out here? I need to eat something! It will all be over soon Abby. Don't leave me again, Mike. I have some bad news sweetheart. - What is it? - The fire went out. Where are you, you bitch! Come and get me! Not as easy to kill me now that I'm awake, you sneaky arsehole! Come and get me! Hey miss, are you alright? Man, she's all kinds of messed up. Miss, are you alright? I don't think she heard me? She can hear ya. I think she's in shock or something. - Who are you? - whoa! - Who the hell are you? - Hey, whoa, whoa! We friends, all right. Look, see... friends. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm gonna take my jacket off and put it on you, OK? You might be in some sort of shock or something? This is just gonna help warm you up. We have a cabin nearby. Let's get you out of these elements. Come on now. Let's get you inside. Do you live here? No, we come here to hunt. Sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. Glen. Albert, Why don't you get the stuff out of the truck. I'll help the lady get inside. Nope! No. Not that cabin. This one. What's in that cabin? You don't want to go in that cabin. That's where we take the animals that we've hunted, and skin 'em, cut them up... things like that. Not a place you want to be, right now. Thank you. Don't mention it. Oh my god, thank you. Can you please take this trap off my leg? It hurts so much. In a minute. You may have hit an artery or something, we don't want you to bleed out. Do you have anything to eat? I'm starving. I have some jerky. Thank you. Do you have a phone? No. No phones. What about a cell phone? One of you must have a cell phone? Look, we come here to get away. Go off the grid as people are fond of saying. First rules is no phones. What if one of you has an accident? We don't have accidents. Right! Maybe one of you guys saw my friend? Your friend? I came here with my boyfriend, Mike. We got separated and I haven't been able to find him. I don't... remember seeing anyone. What did he look like? Brownish, curly hair. Late twenties. He was wearing a blue T-shirt. I don't remember seeing anyone like that. Do you remember seeing anyone like that? I haven't seen anyone like that. What about you Albert, do you recall seeing someone like that? Nope, I don't think so. You know what, now I think about it... I do seem to remember someone down by the highway. Do you remember that, Glen? You know what, I think you right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A young fella down by the highway. You remember that Albert? Yeah, that kind of rings a bell. Yeah, I think he was hitchhiking. Hitchhiking? Yeah, if he caught a ride he could be miles away. We didn't stop to pick him up. You never know what kind of weirdo's are out there. I don't know why he would be hitchhiking, we came in a car. Look I don't know what to tell you, Maybe we saw him? Maybe we didn't? But right now, your leg's really messed up and we should probably do something about that. How far away is the hospital? Don't you worry about no hospital. We can fix you up fine, right here. Right. I think I'd rather go to the hospital, if you don't mind. Look, with you right now like that, you can barely move. We'll fix you up here, then... go to the hospital later. I don't know... Let me get my stuff. Can one of you, please take me to the hospital? Can one of you guys please take me to the hospital. No hospitals, all right. Look... good ol' Tom's gonna take care of you, OK. Boys, grab her arms. What? This is really gonna hurt. Oh... oh. I told you this was gonna hurt. Oh my... Oh my god. - Mike? - Run. Wakey, wakey, little snakey. I see you found your boyfriend. My mistake. I guess he wasn't hitchhiking. Who are you? What do you want? Relax... you'll hurt yourself. Why did you kill Mike? He didn't do anything to you. I don't think you get it sweetie. We're hunters. He's not an animal. You don't hunt people. We hunt whoever we damn well feel like. Are you going to eat us? What are you talking about? We're not fucking weirdo's that eat people. Then why are you doing this? We kill things... because we like to watch them die. That's it. Oh my god. You're sick! I really don't think you are in a position to judge me right now. You can't do this. The cops will come. That ranger! He knows we're here, he'll send for help. What ranger? The ranger at the station, near the parking area. He saw Mike and me come here. He'll know we missing. I thought that place was abandoned? Haven't seen anyone there for years. Still... she says there's one back there, we can't take any risk. Albert, go to the rangers station... get rid of their car and kill anyone you find there. Thanks for the heads up sweetie. Here we thought we were all alone. Now we really gonna have some fun. Hello there, how are you? What can I help you with today? Well, there you go. Looks like Albert's done his job. What are we going to do with her? What do you think we going do with her, stupid? We came here to hunt. We're going to hunt! She's all fucked up? It's not going to be much of a hunt. Killing's my favorite part anyway. What are you going to do? Well... you going to die, you can be sure of that. But... we gonna give you a fighting chance. What? We gonna let you go. You going to let me go? You get a thirty minute head start. Head out, take a direction. And thirty minutes... we gonna come find you. When we catch ya, we going to enjoy ourselves. Nothing we ever catch ever dies... fast! You're insane. We can start the second part now, if you prefer? No! No. Better get moving. This is gonna be the easiest kill ever. No. This is gonna be the easiest hunt ever. I plan on making the kill hard. Dammit! Keep moving. How long it's been? It's been a half hour? Close enough. Come on out! We're getting closer. Oh god. It's ok Miss. Help is here. This guy came to my cabin, tried to shoot me. But I heard him coming. There's two more of them, they're after me. Well then... Let's get moving. His friends would have heard that. Who the hell fired that shot? It's likely Albert. He might have met up with the girl. Shit! I hope he didn't kill her? Let's go find out. Come on, you can do it. My cabin isn't too far. We'll radio for backup. Get you the hell out of here. Hey! Are you still with me? You made it this far, you're almost out of this. I'm sorry Mike! I'm so sorry! Come on. Just a little longer. Son of a bitch! Did the girl do this? No. Must have been that ranger. Now she' got some help. That makes things a little complicated. That makes things more interesting. Let's go. The sun's going down. If we can stay out of sight till dark, it will be a hell of a lot easier to avoid these guys. I don't know how much longer I can do this? Come on kid. Didn't you tell me you had wedding to get to? You've got to get through this, you've got places to be. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Whose wedding is it? Talk to me. Whose wedding? - My sister. - Older or younger? - Hey? - Huh? Older or younger? Older. My older sister, Shelley. Are you in the wedding party? Hey! Stay awake. Are you in the wedding party? - I want to sleep... - No, no! Not yet. Oh, please not yet. Come on. Are you in the wedding party? Come on! - Talk to me? - Bridesmaid. She would have made me the Maid of Honor, but she had a friend who guilt tripped her to making it her instead. Less responsibility for you then, right? Come on, let's go. I need a doctor. Yeah. Yeah you do. Parking lot is closer. Maybe I can get you in my car instead. Are you ready? No. - But I've places to be. - That's right. Let's move. What's wrong? Stand back kid. I think I tripped something. Get... to the car... Well, there's one problem down. I wish he'd given us the curtsey of living a few minutes longer. We could watch the life leave his eyes. Can't win them all, I guess. Let's make up for it with the girl. Sure as hell couldn't have gotten far. Then let's keep the chatter down. Come on. This kid's given us more trouble wounded than her boyfriend did. He was in tip-top shape. Yeah, but it's not all bad news. She's only got one place to go. That ranger station! Besides she's so fucked up! We've the upper hand. - You're right. - I know. And what I say about the chatter? - Hear something? - Yeah. - You think it's her? - Shut up for a second! Go check. Wasn't her. It was a raccoon. Ow! Glen, I'm coming! Go! Get that bitch! Where are you? Come out where I can see ya! My leg! You stay away... I'll kill you! Come on! This's getting tedious. You're almost dead anyway. May as well let me put you out of your misery. You're dead meat. Get away from me. No. No! No! Help! Please send help!
