[Rushing water] To give us a hydroelectric dam with dubious capacity and of doubtful utility, you would drown the natural habitat of countless wild animals. Why, you would wipe out thousands of acres of pristine wilderness. Ladies and gentlemen, this dam is wrong. It is wrong! From the bottom of my heart, I oppose it. Hogwash! Pure hogwash! $10 words wasted on a worthless, bug-infested, back country rat-hole! [Applause] Mr. Bishop... Mr. Bishop-- uh, senator... Lizzy Allison is my neighbor-- Adirondack born and bred. But she's been brainwashed by the bird and bunny nuts! Boo! Boo! In my years as a senator for New York, I find that there is nothing more controversial than an issue forcing us to choose between jobs and the environment. At the head of the cabin where Cindy is holding an important... It's round 10, Elizabeth. If you leave now, the battle wilts away and dies. 300 miles away there's a person who very well may be dying without me. I've got to get there. Lizzy! Lizzy! Shut up! Shut up! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Morrison. We're presently cruising at 18,000 feet. The outside air temperature is -30 degrees fahrenheit. We've got a pretty good tailwind, so we're now estimating our arrival in Burlington at 2:45. The temperature there is 25 degrees with partly cloudy skies. We hope you have a pleasant flight, and thank you for flying Allegheny. [Jazz music plays] You pack your heavy coat, Lizzy? We get an early snowfall, you're gonna need it. ...above all, the Lord our God will ask whether we got down on our knees and offered everlasting Thanksgiving for the gifts he has bestowed upon us. Let's go, Lizzy! We're running late. Ready? Up. Very good. That's good. A little more. Let her down. Good. Fine. Timmy, you and your sister get the gear from the house. O.K. Come on, Lizzy. Lizzy, get the packs. I'll get the poles. Old noise bucket! Mike Allison, the toughest man I know, and he owns a noisy sack of nuts and bolts. I need one. I got to haul your drunken carcass home every Saturday night. Ha ha ha! I'll drink to that! Pete, the children. Oh... Shoot. Put this inside. Something for tonight. Fried chicken! Mike, I really could use you this week. For my sports. I got one hell of a week coming up. Not interested. A man should work at what he knows, and you are one top Adirondack guide. Amen. Still not interested. What's it pay, Pete? My city pups? Oh, they pay pure beef gravy. Makes my mouth water just to think of all them easy greenbacks. We could use the money. Once and for all, you two quit pestering me. I been guiding in these mountains for a good many years. I make a pretty decent living for this family. But today I am taking this boat north. I'm going to drop it in the Chain Lakes. I took the kids out of school, and I'm going to show them what I been yakking about for years. Pete, the woods have changed, you know that. You can read the signs. You know that they mean winter kill. There's going to be a winter kill so bad that the animals are going to take years in recovery. Pauline, our kids have got a right to see the woods as they are now-- before they change forever. You got me. I'm coming with you. Good. Go ahead. Keep an eye on 'em. Pete can't go. He's on a spree. Aw, I can be sober by Tuesday. Make that Wednesday. [Engine rattles] Lizzy and Tim, you be careful in that boat. Mind your father. Do as he says. Hey! You can drop me off. Bye! Bye! Bye! Godspeed!

Maybe he missed. I don't know. Your brother's a pretty good shot. Tim Hood isn't my brother-- not my real brother. No... No, he isn't. But he lives in the same house. He eats the same food. I'd say he gives you the very same love that a natural brother would. That's got to mean something. Well, I guess I like him well enough. But there's no blood between us. He's only family because my mother died and you married Pauline. Ahem. I know if Tim gets the right seasoning, he's going to make a real good woodsman. Sure hope there's a place for him. What about me, father? What can I be? One thing for sure-- you're not going to be a woodsman. [Gunshot] See? He missed the first time. Hey! Lizzy, wake up. I got something to show you and Timmy. Come on. [Sighs] Wow. Those are the northern lights, the Aurora borealis. I can hear mother now-- "all for the glory of God." No church or cathedral ever held such glory. Father? They're right over the Cold River-- right over the entrance. [Timmy] Cold River. Can we go, dad? [Waves lapping] Hey, Lizzy. What's better, looking at deer... Or eating 'em? The current's picking up. Yeah! Yeah. Bet if we listen real hard... Shouldn't we carry her around? What's up ahead, it's called big nasty. We're sure going to carry her around that. Let's try it, dad! Let's go get big nasty. Uh...Mmm. [Moaning] Dad? Shouldn't we get in to shore? Lizzy! Lizzy! Father? What's wrong? I can't move. Father? Timmy, get the paddle. You got to paddle us to shore. Tim! Tim, hurry! Tim! Hurry up! Timmy, get the packs. Packs. Tim. [Strikes match] Timmy, use the candle. Don't waste your matches. We've got some beans. I'll boil them up. Timmy, Lizzy. Father? What can we do? Sit closer. I'm really sorry, kids. I don't know what happened. Something gave way just when I needed it. [Coughs] [Bird calls] Timmy... No! Tim Hood, come back here! Come on, Lizzy. If the woods are so full of food, how come we still only got beans? You just cook the beans. I'll get the rest. [Bird flies away] [Timmy] Breakfast? I found some old raspberry leaves. They sort of make a weak tea. What are you making? Oh, a spear. You mean like for a bear and such? For bears. And partridge, goose, and... Turkey. No. Roast turkey... With gravy and mashed potatoes. And peas. Peas and carrots. Ham. Ham and eggs. Roast beef. Apple pie. Ice cream. Chocolate bars! Come on. Let's have some tea. Not bad. A little chewy. What's in it? Um, uh, plants and a few things I found lying around. Well, if you don't want yours, let me have it. Heh. [Breathing heavily] Uh. When we get out of here, I'm going to come back for my father. Maybe I'll get Pete to help me. Well, I'll come, too. I could have stopped him from coming down this river. What are you talking about? Father gave his word to Pauline. I heard him. He promised that he wouldn't come down the Cold River. If I had told him that I knew, he never would have come this way. My poor mother. Pauline? She'll survive. She's a tough old bird. Tough old bird? What do you mean? Nothing. I mean, she'll get along. Oh, you hate her. I know that. You always gave her a hard time, thinking you were so much better. Jerk. Pauline will drown herself in religion. When you get back, she'll thank the Lord 10 times a day for the next 50 years. She married your father. You got mad 'cause you didn't have him all to yourself, and now you're mad because she's alive and he's dead! Just like her. Pig iron strong and just as dumb. Just shut up! Anything's better than talking to you, you moron. Tim. Timmy. Shut up! You know, if this snow gets much deeper, we won't be able to move. If this snow gets any deeper, we'll be dead. Tim Hood... A real joker. Tim! Aah! Lizzy! Lizzy! Lizzy! Hello! Hello out there! Hello! Is anybody out there? We need help! Help! Ow! Ow, my leg. Yeah, but it's not broken. It's pretty banged up, though. Boy. How did I get here? Well, I carried you. You're quite the guy, you know that? Tomorrow I'm going to shore up the lean-to... Try to get some food. We're going to be here quite a while. We need more wood. We better get more wood tomorrow. [Footsteps] Timmy. I see we were favored with an early snow. You got yourself in one plain fix. Lucky you ain't throwing snowballs at the pearly gate this very minute. How far is the nearest town? 8 miles down the lake and three days of hard walking. Will you show us the way? We just want to get home. Our folks are worried. By now, your folks have given you up for dead, gone, and buried. You'd cause double grief showing up alive. If you'd just help us get there, I'm sure our family would make it worth your while. Worth my while? Worth my while. Ain't that a pip? You think I'm some sort of a gribbling nitwit? This is my business. Next couple of weeks, them animals all gonna be putting on their best furs-- getting ready for winter. Look, we don't want to be here any more than you want us. Miss Moppet, have you ever seen a man like me before? If you mean colored... Some. I guess. Around the hotels in summer. You? No, sir. I had a boat... It sank four years ago, so I bought a sled. Next couple of weeks I'll have my furs. Then, Miss Moppet, you can ride in style. Furs won't mind. Boy, you can pull-- save my old bones for walking. You mean you'll take us? I'm saying I'm going anyway. I might as well take you along. Those people are my mother and father. They look very nice. Who's he? The other one is John Brown. Great man. He lived a long time ago. Was he your friend? Yep... For a time. But... John Brown died when I were a young'un... Before the Civil War. He would have freed the slaves. That John Brown. We learned about him in school. Remember, Tim? Nope. Look at this clean, boy. Ain't it disgusting? Females. They just won't let a man be. [Trapper] Ha ha ha ha. "My day has been too long. "In the morning, I saw the Sons of the Delaware happy and strong. "And yet, before the night has come have I lived to see the last warrior of the wise race of the Mohicans." I read the whole book. As a firearm, it's seen better days. You think you'd like to tinker with it? Sure! Thank you. I said I read the whole book. I don't even get a thank you? And I said... The white man left the book on a trip through here many years ago. Tomorrow we go for venison! Young lady... Thank you. Two years ago... This same wind... These same cracks, they were of no account. Now... The damn cold... Getting to gnaw at me. Sometime it aches... My every bone. Hell ain't no hot place, no, ma'am. I expect it's cold... Cold all the time. Why not move into town? Get a warm room in a regular house. I don't want nothing from town or town people. Not in--not in all my years. End up like my father? Working to give pleasure to rich folk? My father worked for rich people. He guided them in the woods. He cooked their meals and shot their deer. He was brave, and he was strong... But he's dead. We could surely use some help around the house. Come home with us. Of course, you'd have to bathe regularly. More than... once a year? Will you come with us? Go back to sleep. I said go back to sleep. You--you come here uninvited, you accept my hospitality, and now you're going to give me a world of grief. You're a girl that understands nothing. Stay out of my life. He let the fire die for the first time. Ever. Oh, he's gone, all right. [Timmy] Maybe he's a friend of the trapper's. No. That fella just spotted the cabin. Besides, the trapper doesn't make friends. [Clanking] [Clanking] I made fresh coffee. I saw you in the distance. Who lives here? My father, me, our friend Pete. Where are they? Out running our trap lines. They should be back anytime. Sister, my name is Knat. K-n-a-t. I'm one hungry man. Do you suppose I could share some of your food? Whosever in there-- man or beast, if you value this cute little neck, get out here! Now! What is this, a Boy Scout camp? Show your hand, you little whelp. Drop it. Drop it! Drop it! Ugh! I'm painfully hungry. What's this, your maid? Those are the parents of our friend. Pete's his name. No wonder this place stinks. You got a pet nigger. You thief! You dirty thief! You took everything we need. Don't you care? Don't you care if we live or die? No, I do not! When your old man gets back, you tell him thanks for the food. [Clicking hammer on rifle] Fish head soup? I'd rather eat muskrats. Raw. I once knew somebody who'd kill for fish head soup. Where do you live, a barn? I don't see what's so wrong with fish head soup. It's good for you. Tim! Timmy! Tim! Timmy! Help! Tim! Timmy! Tim! [Bear growling] [Click] Oh, no! Ohh! Tim! [Growling] [Click] [Click] [Gunshot] [Bear growling] Come on. Let's go inside. Think of it, Lizzy... Just think of all that meat on that bear. That stupid piece of junk almost got you killed. I know what's wrong. I can fix it. Give it to me. I'm going to throw it in the stupid lake. No, you aren't! I don't want that in the cabin, Tim, not ever, ever again. He said, "8 miles down the lake, three days of hard going." You sure you can make it? The trapper helped us, Tim. Without him, we could have died. We don't know where he is or when he'll get back. There's nothing we can do. We can wait just a little longer. When he does get back, he may need us. He may need us just as much as we needed him. He may need us, but I can sure bet that he won't tell us... Or thank us. One thing, Tim-- something I think you should know. If we stay here, that means Christmas in the cabin, not home. Christmas. He'd better show up, that old goat. ♪ Let earth receive her King ♪ ♪ Let every heart prepare Him room ♪ ♪ and heav'n and nature sing ♪ ♪ and heav'n and nature sing ♪ ♪ and heav'n ♪ and heav'n and nature sing ♪ ♪ Joy to the world ♪ the savior reigns ♪ Let men their songs employ ♪ ♪ While fields and floods ♪ ♪ rocks, hills, and plains ♪ ♪ repeat the sounding joy ♪ repeat the sounding joy ♪ repeat ♪ repeat the sounding joy Wait right there.

You're the provider, a true woodsman. I bet soon you'll be known far and wide. Tim Hood--one top Adirondack guide. As good as Mike Allison? As good as your father? You're getting there. You really are. Merry Christmas, Lizzy. Merry Christmas to you, Tim Hood. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon-- Aah! Merry Christmas. [Scraping plate] Sweet thing, for a hermit girl, you do pretty good. That food was meant for us. Yeah. Before I heard your singing, I was a sure goner. Funny... How Christmas singing... Warms you up inside. When my father gets back, you'll wish you'd died out there. Holidays and all, your old man is out running traps? I need sleep. I don't need no more evil eyes and smart lip. Besides... It's Christmas. I'm just as sentimental as the next guy. Merry Christmas, boy. You pig! Heh heh! Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Sweet thing. Oh... Ain't it pretty? Oh, what a ring-tailed jasperoo I was, oh, Mr. Houdini himself. I was the stud, figured I'd head for the mountains, away from where the cops would look. He and old Mr. Quick, I figured they'd never come looking for me out here. Turns out they never had to. This godforsaken place does their work for 'em. Ah, glory. [Lizzy] I think you're right. [Knat] I'm right? Right about what, sweet thing? About God... Having forsaken this place. You think major thoughts, don't you? For a little girl I'll bet's never been kissed. I wasn't going to tell you this. No, I wasn't, but you rile me to no end, both of you. You just sitting there just as high and mighty thinking, "Reuben Knat... He ain't no better than frozen turd." I do believe I saw your pet nigger out there-- out there in the damn woods not three days ago. Yes, indeedy. That old codger was covered with the whitest damn snow you ever saw, and he was frozen solid. Solid. Stay put, sonny boy, or she gets hurt, real hurt. [Knat] Will you listen, for God's sake? Just-- You killed him! Listen! Listen to me! I didn't kill no man out there! I didn't have to. The winter did it for me. Appeared like he fell through the ice, got soaking wet, got to where he couldn't move no more. He froze right there-- half in, half out of that water, the ice just locking him in solid. Sure a godawful way to die. Death is on your mind. I don't fancy joining no dearly departed. A little light keeps us all honest. Easy, easy, easy. It won't last long. But it's gonna be something-- something you'll remember for the rest of your life. Tim! Tim-- - Shut up! - Tim! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You're gonna get it now. Argh! Lizzie... Lizzie, it's okay. Everything's okay. It's all over. It's okay. Everything's okay. [Grunts] Aah! You little... Tim, run! Aah! Tim! Dirty, bloody animal! I got you now! [Gasps] Stupid move, boy. A one-way ticket, boy, right in my hand. Please, God. Please let me find it. Two shots, boy. Two shots left. A lousy, stinking, animal inside. Please? [Door creaking] Boy? Show yourself, boy. [Rope creaking] [Hammer clicks] One shot, boy. One shot left for you. If that don't do it, I'll rip out your black heart with my bare hands, you living chunk of hell! [Hammer clicks] No! Tim? [Timmy] How did he die? I'm not sure. He could have been shot. He was shot. For sure, Lizzy. [Panting] Tim... I think I hear a bell, a school bell maybe. A school bell? Nah, not out here. I think you've got school on the brain. You jerk. Can't you hear it? Even if there was a bell, it wouldn't be a school bell. Maybe a church bell, but not a dumb old school bell. Will you just shut up and listen? Will you just keep walking? [Bell ringing in distance] [Bell ringing] Tim. Oh, Tim. Tim, that was such a long time ago. A long time. And we made it. We made it. And to think, after all these years, they want to forget that place and build a dam, but they can't take that river away, Tim. Not now. Not ever. Hey! That river of ours-- the Cold River. Godspeed!
