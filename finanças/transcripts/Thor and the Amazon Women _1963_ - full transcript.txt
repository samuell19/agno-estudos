NARRATOR (VOICEOVER): Where now all is sea and desert there once existed, countless ages ago, a region called [INAUDIBLE] In these mountains rose and grew a matriarchal civilization so frightful that dim echos of it's cruelty and violence have come down to us across the abyss of 18 thousand years. The men were considered inferior beings and destined from birth to a condition of slavery. Forced to work in the mines, they had lost the last vestige of a rebellious spirit. All power was in the hands of the women, who, trained in the arts of war, spread terror in all the surrounding countries, bringing with them everywhere. The rare women who dared rebel against this form of government was segregated and trained as the Gladiatricies to fight against each other. This was the first time in history that human beings were forced to kill one another in mortal combat, for the inhuman pleasure of a blood-thirsty queen. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I have summoned you, gracious Queen, to tell you that your kingdom will remain in the hands of women until such time as there shall appear a man so powerful and strong as to overcome the concerted strength of 101 of the strongest of your one. He will not combat with any weapon. He will exercise only his bare physical strength. If you should not succeed in defeating this man he will overthrow your throne. You will seek his name among the descendants of Thor. I have told you only that which time will verify. -Have a proclamation issued, Yamad. Whoever brings me tidings of a man so powerful shall be rewarded with 1,000 male slaves. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING RHYTHMICALLY] -Distant land I once saw a powerful man rescue a young maiden sacrificed to the god Sidac. This man fought against a gigantic beast in it's very cage. After a long struggle, he succeeded in killing the beast with the sole strength of this bare hands. -Where is this man? -Mountains of Har. -You, now. -Once, while returning from the hunts I saw something incredible. A man was in a lair, with very high and jagged walls, where a family of lions had made their den. The wild beasts not only did not attack him as though fearing his strength, but played with him as though he were their friend. -Go. You. -Your generosity, oh Queen, permits you to give heed to one of your Gladiatricies. My name is Ghebel Gor. Will you grant me freedom, and may I hope to become part of your glorious army if I bring you the powerful man you seek? THE BLACK QUEEN: You know him? How do you know him? -Yourwal captured me in the Forrest of Har, the home of Thor, for that is he name. -Thor? What does that signify, Thor? -The name Thor derives from Taris, from whom he descends. And it is said that his strength is beyond measure. -Thor? Yamad, prepare and expedition and speed to the Mountains of Har. The Gladiatrix Ghebel Gor will act as your guide. I want this man brought before me alive. MAN: Come on, come on, you. Hurry up, hurry up. Round and round we go. Now, then everybody tumble down. Ha, ha, ha, ha. [VILLAGE PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN: Round and round, round and round, and round, and round, and round. Faster, faster, round and round, and round. Now, then, come on, now, then everybody tumble down. CHILD: There's Holmolke! -Now tell me where you got this lamb kin, Holmolke. -While I was fishing I saw a tiger astride a broken tree trunk, escaping down the stream. -A tiger? Come, take way this lamb kin. Come, tell me. Ah, tell me. -Yes, I saw the tiger. -You did? [MUSIC PLAYING] HOLMOLKE: Now I know why we were never able to find or face her. She escapes by leaping onto a broken trunk in the middle of the stream. Killing of our sheep will end if you would allow me to go and capture this tiger. MAN: It's very dangerous, Holmolke. How will you be able to kill her? -I'll follow her tracks and you, you can have them prepare me a trap. And the most likely-- TAMAR: Sire. If you will order your men to prepare the trap I shall help my brother kill the tiger. I'll keep watch near the trap. -You, Tamar, are a woman. -Yes. But Nalian blood runs through my veins. -This sign was made at birth by the King, my father. My sister has one just like it. -You'll be king one day, Holmolke. MAN: When your father died I promised I would teach you the virtues of courage and justice, so that one day you might reconquer the thrown that rightfully belongs to you. Go now, and may the gods protect your youthfulness. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHEEP BLEATING] -This is the hour. Tamar? -Shh. Not so loud. -Do you know who it was killed the King, our father? -Yes. I know. It was a conspiracy of women who wanted to rule over men. Remember our beautiful and happy city beside the lake, and the tragic night when, from every direction, there came warriors on horse back, who attacked and over came our defenses. They destroyed and killed without pity. After fighting bravely until the last breath, our father was dragged to his death, bound to a racing steed. Of our city not a trace remained, and our people were made prisoners and taken away to a destination unknown. Of our family, only you and I were able to escape. But don't think about it now. It's all very sad. -One day I shall avenge my father. GHEBEL GOR: Here, this is the place. -We will approach silently, so that the strongman won't be aware of us until the very last. Remember that our gracious Queen wants him alive. We'll divide into six groups and surround the area. You will advance only at my signal. You will act as guide. -If you free me of my feathers it will be easier to show you the way. YAMAD: Set free Ghebel Gor. If you try to escape you will be killed instantly. -I won't try to escape, Yamad. YAMAD: The first group, there. The second group, that way. The third, down there. -Tamar, Tamar. -The tiger. -Who are they? -I don't know. -Now the tiger's gone away. -But who are they? They seemed like women. Strange. -We must continue our watch. Let's hope they go away from here. -That is Thor, the man we're looking for. -If that's him, we must capture him. Follow him silently and surround him. Then, all together, we will pounce on him. Let's go. -Homolke, the tiger. -Look, we got him. Thor! -Good work. -Tamar, instead of the tiger we captured Thor. We didn't do it on purpose. THOR: I should think so. After all, we're friends, aren't we? [LAUGHING] YAMAD: Don't move, if you hold life dear. We have come to capture you, Thor. You must come with us. The Queen's to see you. -I do not know your Queen. And I do not know why she wishes to see me. I am free in this forrest. A forrest I shall stay. -Thor, you must come with us even against your will. -You go away from here. Then you must take me by force. -Seize him! -Stand back! Stop, all of you! I don't fight against women. Stay back! Don't move! Stay where you are! Stand back! -Thor. THOR: I repeat, I do not fight against women. Oh. -Thor. I'll carry you. SOLDIER 1: He must be there. SOLDIER 2: [INAUDIBLE] rock. SOLDIER 3: He's disappeared. SOLDIER 4: How can it be? SOLDIER 5: He seems to have vanished! [MUSIC PLAYING] -But you, who are a friend of Thor, must know how it was he was able to disappear. -I do not know who you are, but I see that you are a prisoner, like me. And I know you should never have led these women against Thor. -No one has ever succeeded in taking Thor against his will. And certainly never by women. -Oh, you keep still. Uh! -Ghebel Gor, you stop it. It's my duty to conduct the prisoner to Babylos safe and sound for the mortal duels in the arena. GHEBEL GOR: You are in command, Yamad. -March on! -What is your name? -Tamar. -We will become friends, I think. [MUSIC PLAYING] YAMAD: Ghebel Gor, come forward. -Our very own people have made us prisoners. -We won't be prisoners for long, Tamar. -You are so young, Holmolke. What can you do? -Escape and seek allies among all the people's of the mountains. The Nalian kingdom is ours, Tamar. And we shall reconquer Babylos, and you too must escape and try to reach the Shepard King. -Yes, Holmolke, we will keep the promise made to the king who has brought us up as his own children. YAMAD: The child will be conducted to the state camp for children. Tamar, to the school for Gladiatricies. Take them away. -Tamar! Tamar! Tamar! Tamar! -They struck you with this weapon. In my tribe this weapon was used to capture wild animals alive. -What is it? I've been asleep for three days. -You see these thorns? They are dipped in juice extracted from the berries of the red plant of Loc, which has the power to put to sleep any animal, even the biggest, for a-- a week or more. -They have taken me for an animal. -Yes, Master. -Where are Tamar and Holmolke? -Who? I saw you alone. -They had caught me in the trap by mistake. -I heard the voices of women. Then I saw you falling from the top of that cliff. I caught you and brought you here. -I must find out what happened to them. -No. Lie still. -It hurts. -Let's see. -Yes, that's it, there. -Mm. A bone is out of joint. I'll put it back in place, but it's going to be very painful. -Don't worry about that. Go ahead and do it. -Give me your other arm. Huh! -Uh! -How is it? -Good. I think it went into place. -Lie back. Easy. Master, now you must lie still a while to heal up. You mustn't move you're shoulder. -But I cannot stay here. I must find Tamar and Holmolke. -But you cannot do anything with that shoulder. And if they've been taken prisoner you certainly can't help them now. You can leave in a day or so, and I shall wait here fishing the best salmon for you. -I expect you to come with me. -To do what? -Perhaps to fight. -Women? -Come forward, Tamar. -You are now enrolled in school for Gladiatricies. It will be your duty to exercise your body and intelligence for combat. When you have achieved sufficient preparation you will fight in the arena, for the glory of our gracious Queen and for the delight of the women of Nalia. I shall encircle your arm with 21 rings, a sign of your qualification as Gladiatrix. With each victory in the arena, we'll remove one ring, thus bring you nearer to liberation. 21 victories will mean your freedom, and the possibility of becoming part of the glorious army of the women of Nalia. If you are brave and strong, Tamar, you have nothing to fear. Any attempt at rebellion will be punished immediately with death. And death is the penalty if you should refuse to kill your rival in the arena when the signal for death is given. -How many Gladiatricies have so far been able to regain their freedom? -You wish to know how many? Not one. -Out, out, out, out, out, out. Lu, come here! -Ah! -Go there! Out, out, out. -Listen, slave. Come here, immediately. If you don't come here quickly I'll have you whipped. -What do you want from me? -I want to know where you found the skin you're wearing. -This? It's the skin of a bear that I myself killed while I was out hunting. -You mean you killed a real bear? But bears are wild and ferocious and live in the forrest. -I, too, live in the forrest. And I'm also a hunter. -Listen, little boy, will you give me your bear skin dress? -I cannot. It is all I have. -But I'll give you mine in exchange. -I would never think of wearing girls clothes. -Well, if you really don't want to. Why don't we go kill a bear so I may have a dress like yours, which I like so much. Would you? -But to kill a bear one must go deep into the interior of the forrest. -You're afraid, aren't you? -I'm not afraid, but I'm a prisoner in here. -Of course. All the men in here are prisoners and cannot run away. But tonight I shall come for you and conduct you out of our city. -You will? -But if the Nalian women see a boy running loose they'll kill him. So for this once you must dress like this. Very well, if it's to escape I accept. You'll bring me a girls dress then. -This very night, as soon as the moon rises try to be here. -I'll be here. Huh! SOLDIER: Get back to your work you little worm. Move! Move! [MUSIC PLAYING] SOLDIER: Take her away. You, too. Go! -I haven't been able to find out anything about my brother. -Don't you worry, Tamar. The Nalians don't kill children. -What do they do with them? -The children are brought up in camps run by the state. And there is no difference between prisoner boys and those of the Nalians. They all share the same fate. They are raised to be slaves in the service of women, and destined to perform the heaviest labor, and made to push like beasts the great wheel in the grotto where salt is mined. -Have you been here long? -Ever since my people were annihilated. The moon has waxed and waned 14 times. -Why haven't you tried to escape? -My father and my eight brothers tried to escape in order to save me. I saw them killed before my very eyes. -You must have suffered very much. What can you hope for now? -I have no choice. The only hope is for an early death. Once before I fought in the arena, you know. And my adversary fell in combat. Fortunately for me, the signal was to spare her. -And what if the signal had been death? Would you have killed her? -No. No, I'd prefer to die myself rather than kill my opponent. -The combat which we must undertake in the arena gives us, however, the possibility of having weapons of our own? -You forget that among us there are women like Ghebel Gor. See her? She has only two rings left. If she succeeds in killing two of us she will obtain her freedom. She's the first Gladiatrix to reach so near the goal. TAMAR: How does she win? She doesn't seem so powerful. -She isn't, in fact. She has always won through deception. Beware of her, Tamar. -Where are you? Wake up! Wake up! -Hm? LOULI: Hurry, I brought you the dress. Hurry! Climb over, hurry! They mustn't discover you. -How will we be able to get out of Babylos? -I know a secret passage. Trust me, come! Hurry! -Ghebel Gor, 19 victories. -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. YAMAD: The purpose of my visit is to inspect the state of training of the Gladiatricies, and refer the results to the Queen. -Today what would you like to witness, Yamad? Perhaps the triangle of death? -I think a simpler mode of combat designated by chance. The triangles of death are better for the spectators in the arena. Agarit, come and select the colors. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] YAMAD: But she's wounded. -Yes I was wounded while training yesterday. -Not her, another. Go. GHEBEL GOR: Allow me, Yamad to offer myself as a volunteer to fight against this woman. -You were not selected, Ghebel Gor. You cannot choose. I shall choose your opponent. The weapons! Begin. May the best win. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SWORDS CLASHING] -The verdict is death. -Oomach, but we're in practice. -To death. [LABORED BREATHING] -To death. -No! I won't kill her! Never! -She must be executed. -She will be executed by her own fellow warriors. No one may disobey the sacred laws of the state. SOLDIER: Forward! Halt! Right face! Ready! She will die for refusing to kill! -I'm hungry, Homolke. We've been walking for days. -Louli, you wanted the forrest. Well this is the forrest. -Look, there! Here you are, Homolke. -Eat it, it's good. -It's very good! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Thor! -Ah, you're awake. You must be very hungry. -Uh huh -Come, drink this milk. HOLMOLKE: Yes, Thor. THOR: Ah, ah. Where are your manners? [LAUGHING] -That's enough, now. The milk is for Homolke. Come, drink. Come on. Do you remember, Homolke, the trap you set for me? Ubaratutu found you right near that spot. -Louli's hungry too. THOR: Drink. There's also enough for her. Try to wake her. See if she wants a little milk. Go on. -Louli, Louli. Louli. Wake up. Louli. THOR: I think Louli should sleep. She's very tired. But you haven't told me anything about her. Who is she? -She's a friend of mine from Babylos. It was she who helped me to escape. -Where is Tamar? HOLMOLKE: Tamar is prisoner of the women of Nalia. She is destined to become a Gladiatrix. Louli told me that they are compelled to kill each other. [HORNS SOUNDING] -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [HORNS SOUNDING] [HORNS SOUNDING] -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SWORDS AND SHIELDS CLASHING] -Ah! [SWORDS CLASHING] -Ah! FALLEN SOLDIER: No. No! Oh, no! No! No! Ah! -As you see, Tamar, one can also win. -Ghebel Gor, you have won 19 times. You have killed 19 of our fellow women. -Do not hold it against me, Tamar. I too, for 19 times, have run the risk of being killed. -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [DRUM BEAT] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ha! -Huh, ah! -Ha. -Eh. -Ah. -Ha! -Oh! -Ah! -Ah! SOLDIERS: Oh, oh, oh, oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [WEAPONS CLASHING] [GRUNTING] -Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ah! [GRUNTING] -Ah! [WEAPONS CLASHING] -Ah huh! [CRYING] GHEBEL GOR: I am your friend, Tamar. -Would you still be if one day we were to face each other in the arena? To win or die? -I hope I shall never have to fight against you, Tamar. You are very gentle. But also strong. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] THOR: Thank you, friends. HOLMOLKE: Louli, there's the king! THOR: Go on! -Ah. My dear Homolke. Oh, oh, ah. THOR: You see? I brought you back Homolke. -This very day we shall set out in search of allies to join us in making war against the Queen of Babylos. -I shall go with you. -Make preparations, two [INAUDIBLE] THOR: Allow me, oh King, to help this boy and your people in the liberation of Babylos. While you seek alliances Ubaratutu and I will attempt to enter the underground city to find out what forces they dispose of, and in what way it is possible to surprise them, and liberate their men who are treated by those women as nothing but worms. -Thank you, Thor. Your offer of help is too important for me to refuse lightly. -We will leave when the sun goes down. UBARATUTU: Uh, but Master. I cannot come with you. There will be no one here to protect all these good people. -You can go in all tranquility, Ubaratutu. -But I don't want to go to a country where the men are treated like worms. -You're coming with me because this fight is a fight for justice. -Mm, uh. -And you too are a Nalien, just as I am. -Yes, Louli. And one day you will sit at my side as Queen. [GIGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] UBARATUTU: These are the dead bodies of men, Master. -Then we've arrived. UBARATUTU: But, Master do all the men of Babylos end up like this? -Many of them do. UBARATUTU: Oh. -Ah, come on. We must go beyond that cliff. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: No, no! Let go! SOLDIER: Move! MAN: I don't want to die! SOLDIER: Move! MAN: Let me go! No! Don't kill me! Help! Help! No, no! Help! Help! Don't kill me! Oh, I don't want to die! Help! No! No! Help! Oh! Don't kill me! Oh, I don't want to die! -Why do you want to kill him? What has he done? -He was the Queen's husband and she doesn't want him anymore. MAN: I don't want to die. THOR: Run away! SOLDIER: Let me go! Let me go! -Ah! [YELLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOLDIERS YELLING] -Uh, huh! SOLDIER: Who are you, man? What are you doing here? -Um, I'm, uh, oh, no. -Come with us. March! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come. Step up here. Step up. Now stand still. Obey the voice that you will here. THE BLACK QUEEN: It is useless for you to guess where this voice is coming from. Don't be afraid. Do as I tell you. Raise your arms. I said raise your arms. Relax. Now flex your muscles. Display the muscles of your back. Now your chest. That's enough. I have chosen you as my husband. -M-- me? [MUSIC PLAYING] -What are you doing there? Are you mad? -If they notice you they'll kill you. -Get back to your work, prisoner. -I'm not a prisoner. They were pursuing me and I hid in this grotto. But what are you doing? How is it there are no overseers? -The overseers here are not many. What use would they be? After all, there's no possibility of escape. We'd all be killed before we had time to reach the entrance to the grotto. -The life of a man in here is worth nothing, much less than that of an animal. -But you are stronger than the women who hold you prisoner. -They are armed. We are not. They are free in their movements while we are practically buried in these caverns. They are sound in body while we exist on a handful of food barely enough for us to survive. How could we ever think of gaining freedom? -You are very strong and still free. Run away before they discover you. -I have come to this city purposely to free all of you. But now I must go away. Wait for the signal to revolt. And keep ready. And if possible, warn all the other prisoners. I shall return. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You will soon witness the games in the great arena, seated by my side, as my husband and king, Ubaratutu. You deserve the honor. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] -How dare you enter here, man? -Thor, it's my Master. Master. This is my friend Thor. -Come away and leave this woman. UBARATUTU: What are you saying, Thor? Why, this woman is the Queen. Don't you understand? A-- a-- and I'm her husband. Go on, tell my friend that I've become the King. THOR: You are not king, Ubaratutu. In a few days this wicked woman will have you killed as she had all her other husbands killed. She only thirsts for blood and death. Come away. -But, are you really so wicked? She has done no harm to me. On the contrary. Don't be afraid, Thor. She knows you're my friend. Isn't that so? Oh, don't just stand there looking like a mummy. THOR: I have come here to save you. But it's dangerous to waste time. -But I don't need to be saved. I am the king. -Don't you understand? When this woman becomes tired of you she will have you killed. -I don't believe you. THOR: Your throne is shaking, false Queen. As free men, we are here to restore justice. Ubaratutu, if you don't come with me I'll take you away by force. -No. THOR: What? -No. -No? -Ooh! -Ooh! -Ugh! Oh! -Ugh! -Uh! Huh! -Argh! -Ah! [GRUNTING] -Ugh! Oof! [GONG SOUNDS} -Uh. -Did you call, my Queen? THE BLACK QUEEN: Guards, I order you to seize that man, who dared to enter here. Arrest that worm of a man. -Come. [GRUNTING AND STRUGGLING] -How can you allow them to do this to my friend? [BOING] [BOING] [BOING] [BOING] [BOING] THOR: Ow. -Thor. THE BLACK QUEEN: Good, Ubaratutu. You struck him neatly. -Me? But I didn't mean to strike him. THE BLACK QUEEN: No? Who did you want to strike then? -Thor was my Master. I wanted to help him. THE BLACK QUEEN: Then you will share the same destiny as your friend. Take him away. -What you're saying? I'm the king. How can you? -No, you are no longer king. UBARATUTU: What? Then what Thor said is true. You are a wicked woman and always changing husbands. -Step aside. Take him away. -That's why your throne is shaking. Because you're wicked. Yes, a wicked woman, that's what you are, a wicked woman. [HORNS SOUNDING] YAMAD: Pick your weapons. -Give me that weapon, it's mine. -Stop it! I order the immediate suspension of all practice. And let each warrior retire to her own cell. -Holmolke, are you sure it was here you were to meet your warrior allies? -Of course. These are the streams of Sedec. -No one has come. They have abandoned you. -Oh, unfortunately everyone is afraid of making war against the women of Nalia. Our very own people have deserted us. -I know why, because no one has the courage to fight against Babylos. Even without allies we can still do something. If we find the secret passage we can liberate Tamar. -We who? -We three. Are you afraid? -You are right, my child. We shall go. So forward, to Babylos. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What are you dreaming of, Tamar? -The distant mountains of Har. Huh? -What is this sign? -I don't know. -But I do. It was the sign of the royal family of Babylos. -How do you know? -Of the royal family the only ones to escape were a girl and a young boy, heirs to the throne, children of the old king. -You wish to denounce me? Do so. -I shall not denounce you, Tamar. -Why do you tell me this, Yamad? -We have need of you, Tamar. You must help us. And you will gain your kingdom. -And why? Why do you have need of me? Tell me, who are you, Yamad? -I am Captain General of the Nalian army, responsible for the Gladiatricies and-- -And? -And leader of conspiracy to overthrow the Queen, and put an end to her ferocious dictatorship. We must be cautious, Tamar. This place is swarming with spies. And even I, who enjoy the confidence of the Queen, am always watched by my General's staff, ever ready to get rid of me at the first sign of weakness. -But if you are the leader of this conspiracy why do you lead the armies of the Queen? Why do you spread death and destruction everywhere? Why do you have the Gladiatricies put to death as you did with the gentle Agarit? Why are you so inhuman and insensible? -Do you think I like acting this way? I must do it. -I believe in you, Yamad. And I am ready to do whatever you say. But how long is it since you decided to act in this manner? -Ever since I realized that the rule of women was a most frightful and horrible form of government. Ever since they killed the man I loved. Ever since they took away my children and put them in state camps. Ever since I began to understand that a woman cannot deprive herself of every human sentiment, in the name of a superiority the nature never meant to assign to them. -Yamad, you have lived this double life in order to be able to free our people. -Yes. But now we are about to go into action. The men whom the Queen has reduced to slaves in the mines have already been informed, and await the signal for revolt. Keep ready, Tamar. Tonight I'll help you leave here and hide you. You belong to the people who must be liberated. And you will be the symbol of the restoration. -I shall do all you tell me to, Yamad. For me and for my brother, the king of Babylos. My brother is young. I have survived the slaughter of my family bringing to safety little Holmolke, educating him in secret, attending the day of vengeance. When I have reconquered for him the throne of our fathers you can ask for anything you wish. -My best reward would be to build a happy life again, at the side of a man who is stronger than I. -Have faith, Yamad. -The two of them are traitrices. -What do you know? -Just overheard a conversation Yamad had with Tamar in her cell. Your Captain General is leader of a conspiracy to overthrow your throne and to kill you. -And the other? GHEBEL GOR: The other is daughter of the last king of Babylos, whom you, oh gracious Queen, thanks to your wisdom, did overthrow. The marks on her shoulder is proof that I do not lie. -The conspiracy has failed. But others will rise after my death who will put an end to the mad dictatorship of women. Those are the women you will have at your side, false Queen. Women like Ghebel Gor. -Your life will be spared, Yamad, only if you give me the names of those who helped you to weave such a conspiracy against me. -No one helped me. -Take her away! And as for you, you were sentenced, and your family was sentenced many years ago, to the penalty of death. GHEBEL GOR: My gracious Queen. -Speak. What do you wish? -If the people knew that in Babylos there is the heir to the king whom you overthrew, they would begin to become superstitious. Besides which, by having her publicly condemned to death how could this fact be kept secret? -What do you propose? -My gracious Queen. You must know that only two more victories now separate me from acquiring my freedom. Let me fight against Tamar, and another, whom I shall select, granting me the choice of weapon. Thus the problem of eliminating this woman without scandal will be solved. -When you have won and acquired your much longed for freedom, you will have earned the highest position in the army, which is now vacant. That of Captain General of Nalia. TAMAR: Nothing says that you will [INAUDIBLE] to a death. -You will also be [INAUDIBLE] -Well, haven't you made up your mind to confess, Yamad? You'll [INAUDIBLE] then? -Ah! -Speak, I tell you! Who helped you to organize the conspiracy against our gracious Queen? -No. You can kill me, Oomach. It's what you wanted for a long time. Uh, ah! Oh, ah! Dictatorship of women is about to end, Oomach. My work will not remain uncompleted. Others will find happiness. Ah, ah! Ugh. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You, Ubaratutu, whom I had chosen as my husband, have dared help this stranger against me and against the royal guard. The Council of State has condemned you to death. However, I have decided since you were my husband, not to have you executed immediately, but only after I have passed sentence on your friend. -You've cannot condemn us. I have done no wrong. Nor has he. THE BLACK QUEEN: You, Thor, lived in the mountains of Har. Why did you come to my city? -I've got other Byblos to save my friend. -Your friend? Who are your friends? -All those who need me. -The friends you are seeking of are my prisoners. Therefore they belong to me. -You are inhuman and cruel. And your power is based on the hunger of men whom you have forced into slavery. -The government which I overthrew, and all governments of men, what is their power based on? On force. -Because that is the characteristic of men, the use of force. -You think like that because you're a man. But we, after a long period of slavery under the rule of men, realized that women were superior to men. They procreate children, they are internally stronger than men, they know how to resist physical and moral pain, therefore they must command. I have reduced you to slavery with the use of force. Can you free yourself with the use of force? We were told by the Sybil that a strong man would come and overthrow my throne. Are you that man? -Put me to the proof. -In the great arena you will have to win against the combined force of 101 of my women. If you succeed in this, the throne is yours. -Here's Babylos. -We must watch out for the sentinels. -We finally found the secret passage. Yes, this is it. I remember it now. -Get down. Be careful. [MUSIC PLAYING] UBARATUTU: Help! -That sound like Ubaratutu. Ubaratutu! UBARATUTU: This is Ubaratutu! -In that crevice. UBARATUTU: Help! -Help me up. Coming, Ubaratutu! Coming! UBARATUTU: Homolke! Holmolke! Help, free me! Hurry! Hurry! Untie me. Untie me! Oh, it hurts. Come here, like that. Good, Holmolke. Good boy. Ah, at last. -That way. -That way? -Yes. -I can't fit through there. Now how do we get out? -Courage. Courage, I'll help you. UBARATUTU: Yes. Come on. Let's try together. [GRUNTING] UBARATUTU: Easy. Careful, Holmolke. Easy, easy. This way. Come on. [HORNS SOUNDING] SOLDIER: Hail to the Queen! -Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. -Gladiatrices of Babylos, you all do remember the prediction announced by the Sibyl? If there exists a man capable of winning against the combined strength of 101 of our strongest women our matriarchy will come to an end. Thor, the powerful man from Har, will now attempt this feat! And here is the squadron of women against whom he will compete! [MUSIC PLAYING] -And at the very same time, in the triangle of death, Ghebel Gor, the Gladiatrix who lacks only two victories, will engage in mortal combat to obtain her freedom. [DRUMS PLAYING] [HORNS SOUNDING] [HORNS SOUNDING] [WEAPONS AND SHIELDS CLASHING] -Ah! -You coward! [WEAPONS AND SHIELDS CLASHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] UBARATUTU: Here they are. -Get up! Get up! -Get up! -Hurry now! Hurry, we've come to liberate you. Hurry! Help us push the grating, together! All of you! HOLMOLKE AND LOULI: On you feet! [MUSIC PLAYING] [WEAPONS AND SHIELDS CLASHING] -Don't kill me, Tamar. I promise I'll do anything you want me to do! Yes, Tamar, believe me! I'll speak to the Queen. Believe me, the Queen will listen! She'll save your life if I ask her to. Uh! -Oh! [GRUNTING AND STRUGGLING] -Uh, ah! [SCREAMING] THOR: Give them weapons, Tamar! TAMAR: Come on! The weapons! -Come on, come on! [YELLING AND WEAPONS CLASHING] TAMAR: Holmolke! -Tamar! -Holmolke! [MUSIC PLAYING] THOR: [LAUGHING] Look out! TAMAR: Holmolke, watch out! Ugh! LOULI: Holmolke, the Queen is running away! TAMAR: Ugh! -Ah! -Tamar! Tamar! -Holmolke, she's dead. The reign on terror is over. I give thanks to the gods who prepare to receive me. -Do not leave us, Tamar. Now that your father's kingdom is yours. -I did not fight for myself. I am a woman. My brother Holmolke will sit on the throne. And with him the authority of men will be restored. Oh. Listen, I feel a new world approaching. If I should die, promise to destroy the symbols of violence and of evil. -You yourself will destroy them, Tamar. You must not leave us. -I-- oh. I-- uh. -Louli, didn't I tell you that someday you would become Queen? [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING]
