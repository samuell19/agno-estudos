Hector. Let me guess. Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea? Actually, I was going to say we should talk. So, now you want to talk to me! It's only been a week! - I was hurt! - Well, you hurt me too. - I didn't go out with Eunice! - I didn't go out with Eunice! Yes, you did! And you stayed out till three o'clock in the morning! There were other people there, too. - Who? - People who work on the programme. You mean other women who work on the programme. Yes, and men - why not, huh? I knew it! So, who is she? - Who? - The other woman. There is no other woman! Huh! Annie, listen. Excuse me. Hello. Hi, Debbie. How are you? Good. OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then. Bye. So, was that her? - Who? - Debbie. The other woman! That was Debbie from the make- up department, confirming my call time for tomorrow. Some excuse! - Hector. - Yes. Please could you pass me your fork? Here, I'm going. You can have my dinner! You should have seen Eunice's face! She was furious! When Eunice gets angry, she is a very scary lady! Hello. Yes. Excuse me. No, no, to her... Bye, Bridget. All right, Hector. Bye. Hola, Lola! - Guess what? - Prince William wants to marry you? I know that! No, I've got a promotion! That's nice. Nice? Nice! It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live! Eunice is no longer my boss! Is that Hugh Grant? It's Bridget Evans here. Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live. Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today? Fab! Ciao! Eunice is so jealous! Now, that is good news. Annie, what are you doing? I'm doing my own editing. Why are you cutting up photos of you and Hector? Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend. Really? Why? Because he is having an affair! Really?! Who with? Well, I thought it was Eunice, but now I think it's Debbie. Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola. Lola? Who's she? Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola! He's women mad! It's fantastic!

Hi, Nick. What are you doing? I am not doing, I am being. What are you being? - Can't you guess? - A man on the toilet? A Sumo wrestler? Can't you see? I am an egg. Of course, you are an egg. Now, what sort of egg am I? Hard- boiled. - Scrambled. - Scrambled? - Fried. - Nearly! Poached! Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg. Yeah. Well, you're making a mess on your bed! Anyway, why are you being a poached egg? It's my new acting class. Total Being. What are you next week? A piece of wood? - A piece of wood? - Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting! Anyway, can poached eggs talk? Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk. No, no, I mean, when you are 'being' a poached egg, can you talk? Yeah. Anyway, I want to stop now, my arms are hurting. So, what do you want to talk about? It is Annie. She thinks I am having an affair. - Who with? - Eunice. - And Debbie. - What? Two women, Hector! You cheeky thing! But I am not! - So tell Annie then. - I have but she doesn't believe me. - Why not? - I don't know. Excuse me. Hola, Lola. I'll take this outside. How are you, Lola? So, it's not Eunice, it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola? Stop, please! I knew it! It had to be a selfish man- driver! Please, I have a voucher. I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish. Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry? I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus! People park on yellow lines and then are surprised when they get a parking ticket! There was this one guy today - 'Please, I have a voucher.' No excuse! Mind you, he was quite cute. Nick. Nick, are you OK? Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector. Well, there's something wrong with Nick. - Well, I could have told you that! - No, he won't speak, he won't move. I know. He is being a poached egg. - A what? - For his new acting class. Hi, Nick.
