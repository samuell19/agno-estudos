It's OK Great look at this comic book Xu-rui, come on Hi, Grandpa Here's Tian-wen with Mr. Ye Mr. Ye sorry to drag you in from Yokoham so early Nice to see you Mr. Ye says the older he gets the more he loves to eat This way... Mr. Ye It's good to see both your sons doing so well, Mr. Yang Well, I may be guardian to both Kenichi and Tian-wen... but to them I'm just an old man who talks too much There's a Hongkong chef... at the new Fujian place, too They're competition Tian-wen's worried He's smart. He can hold his own against anyone Those Fujian people want to move here into Shinjuku, too Be careful We should serve Cantonese food in our Yokohama place, too Just Taiwanese isn't enough Chinese come to Japan now from Beijing, Shanghai... and even Wenzhou They all like Cantonese food Haven't you talked to him yet? To hell with it Just seeing Yuan Cheng-gui is no big deal If Yuan and his Shanghai thugs lay a hand on you... the old man loses face Don't worry. I'm sure he'll help you out Let's go back to the others I'm fine here They're speaking Taiwanese and I don't understand That's because you never bothered to learn NO, that's because no one ever bothered to teach me If I win the New Year's lottery in Hongkong... I'll start a restaurant in Shibuya, too Guan-yao call up your friend Cui-hu Get him to see Kenichi at noon Say I asked him to All right Kenichi, the rest is up to you You mean Beijing Cui-hu? Why are you mixed up with him? Come for New Year's dinner You remember that work Mr. Ye suggested in Hongkong Why not think about it again He mentioned it again today You could even leave tonight There'd still be time Why? What have you heard? The reason Fu-chun is back Is that bad for me? There's a storm brewing A sacrifice might be needed Talk to me about Hongkong after you see Yuan Kenichi, let's go to the game center Listen, will you do something for me? Sure! Is it dangerous? Spy work Xu-rui Come here In a minute Xu-rui Why does the Taiwan group... suddenly want my help? I'm not in the Taiwan group Oh, that's right... You're mixed Taiwanese and Japanese You killed Taiwanese guy didn't you You and that guy Wu Fu-chun. Were hanging out with all those war orphans kids that gang of losers called Dragon not follow the game to play Why are you running to me for help now? OK, let's hear it. I'm not here for help I'm offering a deal You talk too much You want to get into underground banking You need a Japanese citizen as a front I might let you use me for that Isn't that something A half-breed who deals in his own blood You piece of shit You want my help and you act like it's making a deal? What have you got to lose? OK. Let's say this looks like a good deal I'll call Yuan Cheng-gui and tell him to leave you alive I wouldn't want to lose out on a good deal, would I... Looks like lunch was on you Or was Cui-hu buying? How do you like Beijing food I wonder why everyone thinks I want to hurt you Mr. Yang and even Cui-hu come rushing to your side... When you first came here as a student, Mr. Yuan... you read The Romance of The Three Kingdoms You may remember it was me who lent it to you I'm sure you remember that Everyone says Ryu Kenichi is very shrewd It would seem so In that book you remind me of Lu-bu who served three masters Every tit he sucked he called Mother He had to live on his wits, too Just like you and your partner Wu Fu-chun You're a busy man, Mr. Yuan so perhaps you forget... my partnership with him ended... a year before he killed your man Yes, that's what you said, isn't it Talk Fu-chun's got nothing to do with me We split up Care to see more? I've had two favorite videos over the past year... this one... and the one of my man's funeral You're the only one Fu-chun can call on in Shinjuku Bring him to me by New Years' Eve That's three days Then you can go play mah jong and enjoy your New Year Mr. Yuan... I've compromised enough We Shanghai people are too generous for our own good I'll do what I can Oh, your book... I'm not sure did I ever return it to you? What was Natsumi like? Like a hostess Real pretty You ought to meet her OK, enough of that... She went back to her place then left right after that I pretend to make a mistake and knocked next door The lady there told me all about her She said Natsumi came from Nagoya four days ago... and borrowed her phone to call back there It's that building... number 203? Keep this quiet OK I'd never been to Nagoya I didn't even know how far away it was What would someone from Nagoya... be wanting with me? Instead of fooling around about this woman... I should have been scouring Shinjuku for Wu Fu-chun My mission is find Fu-chun for Yuan Or have forgotten everything and simply left town But I was used to waiting I'd always been waiting for something it was better to wait inside than out Who's there? Don't move So you're Natsumi... You wanted to sell me something... So you're Mr. Ryu... I'd given up on you I was checking. I don't deal with people I don't know So you broke into my room? And with a gun That's how it goes Just in case there was someone bad with you You could take off your shoes We do that in Japan, you know That's how that goes If he's big and bad, I might have to leave in a hurry through the window Hi. I'm Ryu Kenichi And I'm Sato Natsumi You're Chinese... Japanese. Raised in China Where? Up north. Heilongjiang Oh, a war orphan's kid... So what? You're returned from Taiwan, aren't you? Can I have one? How did you hear about me? Answer a question of mine first You're sure no one name Wang works for Yuan Cheng-gui? A lot of guys work for him There could be a Wang there, or a Chin You're not from Shinjuku Who told you about me? Wu Fu-chun I'm from Nagoya. I'm his girlfriend What's wrong? Where is he now? I don't know You don't know? You're his girlfriend. Why don't you know? Don't you want to know what I want to sell you? Don't change the subject Wu Fu-chun What? I want to sell Wu Fu-chun I ran away from Nagoua I came to Shinjuku because I knew he'd follow me here I knew there'd be a price on his head here I figured I'd lure him up here... and sell him to you You deal in anything but children's organs, don't you That's what he said about you Got any ideas? That's where you come in... isn't it? I haven't said I'll do it I'll be back For now I had to get away from her I had the feeling she already had me on a string Hi, Kenichi Go on in Is Tozawa here? How are you How are you getting on? Here's the God of Luck Wait. I'll pay back everything Have you ever won here? No, But only the Thais will give me credit My Korean friends won't even let me in their place How much can you give me? 200,000 yen, Half up front... the rest when you finish What do you want to know? About Wu Fu-chun A war orphan's son, Japanese name Sakamoto Tomio Came here in 1984 from Jilin lived in Chiba That much I know Yeah, you were partners... A long time ago What do you want to know? He never said much about his past especially his family I'm pretty sure his parents are still in Chiba Is he in touch with them or not? One more thing... Who's he been with lately? Didn't you write an article about war orphan's kids once Go to it OK, I can handle it I'm in a hurry By when? Before I get killed What happened? Wu Fu-chun shot up... the Shanghai Sea Said he was after a woman What's going on? You don't know? Fu-chun attacked Yuan's mistress's club He was after a woman Yuan's men are after three people Wu Fu-chun, his woman... and me This place is too near Shinjuku Where are we going? Lidabashi. I look after a client's place there what's so funny? I'm just happy... nothing This is no time to laugh But you're worried about me Don't get me wrong You're my trump card in this deal, that's all Oh, really? Natsumi had lured Fu-chun to Tokyo... telling him she was... in the hands of 88an Cheng-gui Was a woman capable of that a card in my hand... or was I a card in hers? This is a nice place Not really finished, though. We take our shoes off in Japan, you know Sorry Hey... does the shower work? Can I take a shower? Thank you Papa Yang? Kenichi? Where are you? Somewhere Yuan can't find me He was looking all over Shinjuku for you I've calmed things down a bit Really? I told him that even you... wouldn't be stupid enough to help Fu-chun attack his club But you've got to hand Fu-chun over to him. Any luck so far? I'll need money How much? Two million Why do you need that much? I've looked everywhere I can think of myself Now I'll need to hire help When do you want it? I'll send a woman over for it Then I'm going to disappear for a while Good idea I'm going out. I'll be right back OK The Report shows that Your Natsumi is a fake This is the real one She died in a car crash It's easy Her passport remains valid The woman at your place buys it She take out credit cards... and sets up a new identity Great. Tell the Colombian to give you what you want... and put it on my account Thanks I have to go I knew you were capable of anything but I didn't think you were that devious Why? You looked at my wallet and my passport We've never dealt before I'm sure you'd do the same Wouldn't you, Sato Natsumi? So in my room... did you feel around in my trunk? Did you touch my panties... and get all excited? What's wrong? Don't you want me? Cut it out Get changed. I've got a job for you We're going out? I just took a shower I need your help Sure It's Kenichi I need a car right away No, no, not that... This. But then I'll have to put on make-up Do that, then You haven't asked why I left Fu-chun I don't have to ask No one stays around him very long. Especially women But one strange thing... He's never been the type to get stupid over a woman Day 2:12:23 a. m. Go straight for 50 meters to a lane... called New Center Street On your right... is a Chinese medicine store called Seikando The owner's an old guy Tell him Kenichi sent you Hello? Kenichi? Just two days left, you know Mr. Yuan is concerned about you Kenichi? Where are you? Xui-Hong... Fu-chun charged into the club yelling and screaming... The guys tried to stop him and there were gunshots Someone knocked me flying I don't remember much I think maybe I fainted When I came to he was right in front of me He stuck a gun in my face and said, Where's my woman? Who's your woman? I said I thought he'd shoot me I fainted again When I came around the police were there I guess he didn't shoot because we all used to be friends Mr. Yang says he calmed down Yuan Cheng-gui He didn't calm him down he made a proposal A proposal? They were on the phone for a long time They made a deal Do you know what? No. Only that something's ready to happen in Kabukicho and that Fu-chun being here could start it there's a storm brewing A sacrifice might be needed What? That's what Mr. Yang said Shouldn't you get away? It's too late I'm not leaving now Because of her? I'll see you later Who was that? This is for you So how was Kabukicho? Quiet. Just some drunk wanting to know You made me dress like this There's only Oh, yeah... I took 100,000 You did? Surely what I have to sell is worth more than that That's different Stop fooling around Let's get going I need money to take care of myself Give it back Lend it to me, then It's 20 per cent interest, payable in ten days If that's OK with you... Tightwad Oh! There was someone who wa wanted to see you Who? You're the third person today who's told me to hide I don't know who else, but... it's you I'm thinking of, elder brother Give up this yakuza shit Maybe you can be a straight businessman, but I can't And you know why? Because just like Yuan and Cui-hu and the rest... you're living in the past. You're behind the times Everybody's going global. To keep up with the times... there has to be... a revolution in Kabukicho The little guys will be eliminated And now Fu-chun shows up A perfect chance to get rid of anyone in the way Don't you get it? Mr. Ye in Yokohama and the Fujian group in Ikebukuro... want to take over Shinjuku Mr. Ye, with the port in Yokohama... controls guns, drugs... and foreign prostitutes The Fujian group investing in Japanese real estate Papa Yang will become Mr. Ye's man in Shinjuku Little Wen... I need a favor from you I want to bring Yuan to your restaurant... and turn Fu-chun over to him I want you to get Papa Yang to come along as insurance At my place? Don't worry Yuen won't live to make it into the restaurant You know I hate stuff like that OK. I'll do what I can But we aren't brothers any more And you don't call me Little Wen any more Sure. You don't have to call me big brother any more, either One last thing... Keep away from that woman This is Faye Wong... a H.K. Singer from Beijing You're really cold aren't you Why? Little Wen admires you, You know How would you know? Anyway, nothing good happens to people who end up with me Friends, or lovers So are you afraid for me if I'm with you? Or are you afraid of me? What do you mean? I don't know these streets... but I do know that we're just driving around Is that because you don't want to be alone with me? Don’t waste your time Hey... did you ever do it in a car? Don't you like Faye Wong? What's this song? You like it? My mother had this boyfriend ...a Black pianist He used to fuck her to this record Ah, childhood memories I like it Then it's yours Do me a favor We're going to be together for a while Even if you don't mean it, treat me as your lover Even for a few days Whatever you like Yeah? I'm glad This can be our song Whatever you like To get some food go home Here we go Hello? Fu-chun Where are you? I'm on my way Get a taxi Can't I come? No Hey. Let's go for a drive Hey, wait Where you going? Get lost How are you? No, how are you? Good If I said I wanted to kill Yuan Cheng-gui... would you lend me a hand? Let me ask you something first What? You never cared about any woman before Who's this woman you're looking for now? You know why I had to leave Shinjuku last year? You killed Yuan Cheng-gui's right-hand man You Know why? No, I don't I don't have time for 20 questions What's your hurry? Do you have to go somewhere? I've been hiding for three days I haven't talked to anyone OK, let's talk We had to form gangs when we first got here... to protect ourselves from the Japanese kids That's why I started the Dragons I know that A girl from my home town in China got gang-raped One of the guys who did it was from Shanghai The girl was only 14 She ended up working as a bar hostess She came to me for help She became my woman And this guy from Shanghai... was Yuan's man, the one you killed... Three days ago Xiao-lian phoned, and said Yuan had her Xiao-lian? Xiao-lian My woman You get her away from Yuan, then we'll go kill him It's a good thing you didn't kill Xui-Hong She thinks you didn't because we were partners I'll kill anyone who's with Yuan That shithead Sun-Chan showed up I got the hell out of there I was just about to put a bullet in Xui-Hong, too She doesn't know that She might be able to help I'll ask her. Where do I find you? You know the dragon... Yeah... Shinjuku Station, West Exit Look for the dragon Look for what? You'll be surprised But you still haven't said you'll help me kill Yuan... Hello, Kenichi... I hear you're with a woman That might not be such a good idea Sleep well last night? I didn't sleep at all What's wrong? A nightmare What about? I don't remember You weren't dreaming of making love to me? Where'd you go? I was awake, so I went shopping Then I cleaned the place Finally it looks like someone lives hare. See? If I'm your girlfriend, I must act like it, shouldn't I Then maybe you should tell the truth About what? You're not Sato Natsumi What did Fu-chun say? That you grew up with him China That's right He lived near me Our mothers were Japanese, left behind after the war I met him again here Is that all? Then why all the lies? How can I trust you if you won't tell me the truth? When I was small, my mother and father hit me And then later Fu-chaun hit me Are you going to hit me, too No, I'm not... Kenichi, Kenichi But you're not serious about killing Fu-chun, are you? Yes, I am. When I was 12, he raped me You happy now? All the men I've known have only wanted one thing But with you, I don't mind I want to believe you... but I don't... Lovers or not I don't care I shouldn't have gone into her room I shouldn't have opened her trunk Kenichi, Kenichi, be gentle You're not like the rest of them I'm sorry, I shouldn't have compated you to them I didn't think it would get so complicated Can you still do it? I've never been to a hot spring Why don't we forget everything and go to one? A hot spring is no big deal It is to me, even just once Fu-chun once said... there are two kinds of people The cheaters and the cheated We'd steal credit cards and use them at department store Kids' clothes, mostly A few days later Xui-Hong would return them... and say they didn't fit No one suspects a housewife returning baby clothes Have you ever killed anyone? Just once Hello? Tian-wen... What? Now? You're going to use her? She's Fu-chun's girlfriend She's the bait She's how we get to him So what's the plan? Tomorrow I call Yuan I tell him some Malaysians have got Fu-chun... and I'll hand him over somewhere Yuan will feel safe... somewhere Yuan will feel safe like Tian-wen's restaurant... at say, 5 p.m. I need you there as insurance so Yuan will come But really, before Yuan reaches the restaurant... Fu-chun steps out and puts some bullets into him Think it'll work? The Shanghai group won't sit back... and let us kill Yuan Cheng-Gui You know the Shanghai group is riddled with factions Qian-bo's looking to be number one himself Xui-Hong always tell me the truth If we give them Fu-chun's corpse... they'll make a bit of noise and that'll be that You think so? I'm the one in danger All you have to be is a guarantor Looks like New Year's Eve dinner might be a bit late... How's business? Very good, thanks Tian-wen... thanks Excuse me Raise up OK The wife says you be sure and come to dinner, too It's at Tian-wen's, so you'll be close by Mr. Ye wants to see you Looks like fun Want to come for a drive? Yes, yes, yes Very nice Where'd you get her? She's Fu-chun's girlfriend His life is in the hands of you and Mr. Yang right now Since you invited me to be in this little play... I'd like to study my part So what's going to happen in Kabukicho tomorrow? How can I help if I don't know? If it's too late How can I help? That's easy. We give Wu Fu-chun to Yuan Cheng-gui You know, this guy is so mean Let's ask you Maybe we'll go somewhere and I'll show you what I'm like we'll see who you prefer... Him, of course How will you know that until you've tried me? Stop it OK. Fu-chun's going to kill Yuan Good idea Makes me want to come in my pants I'll have this woman someday You can have her till then Stop here Kill that bastard Wait here You were gone so long... I went to the toilet The toilet? Not the telephone? What do you mean? You don't trust me yet? I haven't decided to trust you yet I don't know anyone in Tokyo Who would I phone? Someone wanting information Where did Cui-hu spring from just now Maybe you called him so you'll be sure of a way out I don't know his phone number Why would I call him? I hate him There's always the phone book... What are you doing? If you won't trust me, what else can I do? Can you stand up? You OK? I just went to the toilet I did something else, too A guy like you wouldn't know what day this is... Happy Valentine's What's wrong? Did I blow it again? Don't you like chocolate? You want to be a bat, like me? Sure I do Where are we going? A bat follows its instincts Then we should play our song Isn't the owner here? Are you sure... We can go in? Terrific If only it would snow... You can't have everything... Let's not have sex tonight Just hold me Sex was the furthest thing from my mind... Day 3:Midnight, Chinese New Year's Eve Mr. Yuan... the Tao Yuan restaurant at 5 Don't bring any more than two men with you Too many and things will get difficult There Fine Thanks You eat first. I've got some thing to do And call my call phone in 15 minutes Why? Just do it. 15 minutes, OK? Fu-chun Fu-chun Remember Jiro? The ex-police inspector... I'll go wash. Take your time They'd look all over Shinjuk and never find you here The best place to hide is in plain sight Well? Did you find where Xiao-lian is? Don't worry Xui-Hong convinced Yuan to let her take Xiao-lian Now I can kill the bastard Without having to worry Today at 5... Yuan and two of his men will pass here I'm supposed to meet them at the Tao Yuan restaurant At 4:45 a boy will come and give you a sports bag In it will be a shotgun and a walkie-talkie Wait till I tell you Xiao-lian? I'm with Fu-chun Tell him you're at Xui-Hong and you're all right Xiao-lian You're safe Don't worry. I'm going to Kill that son-of-a-bitch Until then... Xiao-lian? She hung up Xiao-lian? Anyway, once it's done, get the hell out of there I'll bring Xiao-lian to the cemetery in Takadanobaba Oh, yeah... the place we used in the old days... Just a minute... One last thing Buy a lottery ticket for tonight's draw For me... and Xiao-lian Hello... I'd like the number for Mistral in Shinjuku... What the hell are you doing? Sorry about that... but who sent you? Don't be so violent I wanted you to ask him I thought you wanted me to kick him Tell Mr. Ye I appreciated his concern, but I'll be fine You called Papa Yang and said we were there, didn't you I did what? No one knew we were in that coffee shop But I never thought he'd have us followed When you went to pick up the money, did he say... you can't trust Kenichi I'm your insurance if anything happens If you knew that, why ask? So Papa Yang called Cui-hu yesterday, too Remember? The cheaters and the cheated We're the side that chests Think Why were you able to fool me? If you can't trust me, try someone else Anyway, the plan won't change Take care Hello? I'm glad I was in time I don't die that easily. So? Fu-chun's father died of lung cancer five years ago His mother's on welfare in Chiba His elder brother's in prison for murder Fu-chun's the next brother Then there's two girls. One died at four in China The younger one's Japanese name is Machiko... Fu-lian in Chinese What? Her family calls her Xiao-lian She's wilder than her brother She ran with a gang in Chiba did robberies, everything She had trouble with a guy... then slept with her eldest brother so he'd help her He killed the guy, went to prison... So she did the same thing with Fu-chun She's the kind who'll do anything Rumor has it she even killed someone Do you want to kill me? I didn't think you'd come back... That I'd never see you again No, no... I'd like to know more about. Fu-chun's little sister You found out, hub... I'll tell you the truth. If you like. We've still got some time When we came to Japan we couldn't speak Japanese... We had no money... Kids picked on us... I already knew I was raped by a gang The leader owned me He'd give me to other gangs. ...and let then do what they liked with me I couldn't take it I went to my older brother I slept with him He killed three of them for me... and went to jail And then... Fu-chun came to me... wanting me to sleep with him I ran away when I was 17 Then last year Fu-chun found me in Nagoya I swear to you... it was rape He moved into my place took all my money... He'd hit me... He even got me pregnant I was pregnant with my own brother's baby I had an abortion Kenichi... let's run away Forget everything... the plan, killing Yuan... I've got some money Let's go somewhere... we don't have to think about who's betraying who Let's go now It's too late, Xiao-lian. We can't go back now It's gotten too big. There's nothing I can do alone Even if I know it'll fail, I have to go through with it Anyway, the place you want to go... is only a dream Get changed. It's time You kill Fu-chun Boss... Hello? Oh, hello, Mrs. Yang Fine, thanks His wife's there, too There won't be a problem Mr. Yuan's on line 2 Let's get this over with and have New Year's dinner Hey, what's going on?

Your guys shot Fu-chun... Who killed Yuan? Cui-hu's men. Thanks for bringing him into it That's it Papa Yang's taking Shinjuku from Mr. Ye Cui-hu joins him... Without Yuan the Shanghai group loses power... It's like The Romance of the Three Kingdoms... Now I get it! You want to be boss of the Shanghai group! Which makes this guy the cur who betrays his lord for a woman I'm tired of being kept Mr Yang's going to give me all the clubs in Kabukicho Not bad, huh? So where are we going? You wanted to kill Fu-chun, didn't you? Hey, Can I have a smoke? Sure Can I get that? Make it quick Hello? OK The lottery's out What's the number? Freeze Xui-Hong Freeze Xiao-lian... Xiao-lian... Xiao-lian... Xiao-lian... Do your brother a favor Send me away Goodbye... big brother Go to the Tao Yuan with all these cops around? Papa Yang and Mr Ye are having a meeting I have to get things straight for us right now Let's go back Already? Let's go Kenichi Hi, Kenichi Kenichi What's wrong? Surprised I'm still alive? I have to talk to you three gentlemen again Especially Mr Qian-Bo the new Shanghai group boss What happened tonight? Well, let's say Xui-Hong and her boyfriend Sun-chun joined up... with Wu Fu-chun... to eliminate their boss, Yuan Cheng-gui But they fell out, shot each other to death... and now the police get an anonymous tip from me... that there are three bodies at a certain place What do you think? That could work What do you think, Mr Ye? Mr Ye says that's fine with him... but that we'll need the Shanghai group to agree Sun-chun was an ambitious man The people under him will confirm that Let's leave it at that for now That settles Kenichi, then The problem of this woman is a little more difficult What problem? Three days ago Mr Ye had a phone call from Nagoya... asking him to find Wu Fu-chun and his girlfriend It seems they robbed an underground bank there... killed two of its staff and stole 60 million yen Now, if Wu Fu-chun is dead... then perhaps we might have this lady return the money If she can't this is a serious loss of face for Mr Ye He will not be happy What happened is... she started this whole thing She schemed to have Yuan kill Wu Fu-chun... so she'd have all the money This was all about money? Mr Ye suggests people be told... that she put Xui-Hong and Sun-chun up to it What if she returned it? That would only be a start Where's the money? I bought a condo A smart move... or a stupid one... If she sold the condo? Mr Ye says he cannot wait that long This must be settled tonight Then how about this... Enough of this Be grateful we've left you alive No, wait... It's Mr Ye who's behind all of this He's trying to take over Kabukicho Mr Ye and Qian-Bo They had a falling out and shot each other And now Yokohama and Shinjuku are yours, right? It's OK Why didn't you kill Yang? Someone's got to tell the police what happened We might get split up You take this How did you know Yang would kill Qian-Bo? He was setting Xui-Hong up... so he'd control the Shanghai group And he'd been aiming at Ye's position for a long time I got him there that much faster That's why he let you go? He's very smart, is Papa Yang... He sure is He thought you'd get away from Xui-Hong... and show up back here But you're clever, too, Kenichi Imagine! Leaving by the roof But I'm a smart guy, too Shall we take a drive? All this shit you've stirred up tonight is a godsend for me I won't be Yang's stooge forever All I was supposed to do was deliver you two to Yang Now if I need a witness about today to keep Mr Yang honest... I can have one of you Just which one of you isn't going to be an easy choice The one I choose has to die, you see Dead men tell no tales It'd be nice to have a pretty girl to play with... Can't you just let the both of us go? If I do that, he'll just send someone else to get you No. One of you dies and the other goes free Wouldn't you like to be with me? Hands off You think I didn't know you had a gun You're a smart girl. Think about it I don't think you'll shoot me Kenichi What did I tell you I told you to give her to me Go on, Xiao-lian, Shoot What he says makes sense Don't think about it Go on Shoot Great What a climax Damn That bitch was really going to shoot you She blew her chance Well, that's how it goes Sooner or later she'd kill whoever ended up with her, you or me She's bad luck. That's all it is Finish her off I shouldn't have gone into her room I shouldn't have opened her trunk She was stronger than me She knew exactly what she wanted... and she'd do anything to get it Maybe she was the only way I had... to get out of this shithole of Kabukicho Kenichi... It's snowing... That's nice How long did I stand there holding her? Did it really snow? I don't really remember I vanished from Kabukicho for a while Later Cui-hu invited me to join him He said I'd become emotionless... a completely cold-blooded animal And that made me the perfect partner for him Two years later, Mr Yang became don of the Chinese mafia in Tokyo For his 70-Th birthday... People came from all over Japan There was a rumor... I would appear to avenge Natsumi That was wrong I was there to take Shinjuku from him But Natsumi... who was Natsumi, anyway?
