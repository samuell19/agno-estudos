You can just take me prisoner. No! How about you? Where are you from'? Are you the daughter of a big store'? Are you an evil spirit bewitching me'? Perhaps I am. Well then... bewitch me for my entire life. I know some more. Kyo, mistress of Manjiya. She died because of you. Kyo'? No! I know it well! She hanged herself. It's even on the news board! Oh, that thing! It wasn't what it seemed to be. You said she was pitiful. To her, it wasn't. Let's say I overdid the treatment. To tell the truth, she died happily - What'? - She said so. She said so after she got pregnant by me, and dumped by her husband. The first time she tasted a vvomawsjoy she felt it very deeply She wanted to be forced to die. She wanted to die then'? She died 1O days after. Her husband suspected me. Even so, there's no evidence. Even if it's her wish, you don't think it's your fault? - What fault? - A person is dead! Stop kidding. She wanted to be forced to die. That's her wish! L'cl rather think... I saved a person. Do you understand? VWI you understand? Let's drink! Yes... yes! Let me! Beautiful. Very beautiful. Musashiyafs mistress... the same way? Musashiya? Tell me about... Musashiya. You keep me on the edge! Musashiyafs mistress... is called Sono. What a woman! To tell the truth, I've had so many women, I've never had someone like her! The first time! She had to have many men. What a mistake to take that man as husband! Mistake? He's gentle, won't ever raise his voice, good for a son-in-law. But he doesn't know how to handle a woman. A cold fish. He's a cold fish! A fool! Useless! She needs me as her medicine! Poison... He's poison to a woman like Sono! - Poison? Why'? - Why'? Mino, you still don't understand. Listen. This woman... is like fire. Yes. She's always burning. That husband of hers... was a useless piece of firewood. He had TB. He's recuperating in their Kameido villa, but they all burnt to death. Why do you know all this? I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you! Pillow talk... That woman... was always having fun with me. Then she told me. About herself. Her husband. She told me everything. They made me blush! You two laughed at the patient? Why not'? He's laughable. They died, now you laugh. It's all over. Laugh! I said it's all over. Now you're the one I love. Forget the past. You're not human! Your hands! Put them clown! Your sedan was stopped. You were beaten up by 3 men you didn't know. I know how much you paid them. 5 ryo each. "Beat up the one in it, but take it easy" You... You'll divorce your wife? A lie. You want her to leave on her own. People at Tokushima told me... No matter how hard they work, you won't give them the shop. This room... Manjiya, Musashiya... here! Yes'? You are'? Musashiyafs owner... he's my father. Sono... my mother. You said you laugh. You laugh, instead of being laughed at. Now... laugh! There's a camellia tree beside a small pond, Dad. You're beside that pond. H! Come soon. After I punish those men who made you suffer. You told me the story of oamellias. I still remember it. Good. The branches too. Reminds me of my childhood. I miss them... There's a camellia tree by the pond inside the bush. Its roots are in the water, its branches extend beyond the pond. At a certain season, flowers drop, covering the entire pond. So beautiful. It's in Kawasaki, where I was born. You nevertold me this. Wherever my parents scolded me, wherever I had fights with friends, wherever I felt sad and weak, I went to see those camellias, alone. I miss them! Why didn't you tell me'? I've always taken camellias... I'm just the son-in-lavv of our dead owner. All I think about is this store. I haven't thought about the camellias until today I miss them. I'm back. The mistress said she's sick and can't come here. Tami! Why go and fetch her'? I know she won't come! Sorry I have things to discuss with her. Discuss? The doctor... said we should take good care of you this time. He said you should forget the store and rest in Kameido. I won't go! I don't need to! - But Dad... - I'm OK! Please, Dad! Please! The air is better there. Rest and have some good food. Do what the doctor says! I know better about my sickness! I don't need to go! - But... - Shut up! I know I get weak when I'm sick! What's wrong? Get a grip! Someone! Come! Are you OK'? Dad! Thanks. Sorry I don't know you're here. - A visitor? - Yes... no. Just then... they're busy Soon... You're beautiful. You've got more and more beautiful, Shino. But look after your skin. A visitor! But aren't you sick and resting in bed? There's no visitor. I'm so tired... I was sleeping. Tami must have told you, Dad is very sick. - Lots of blood... - Don't tell me that! So disgusting! The doctor said we should take very good care of him. Dad should forget the store and stay here. No! - No way - But Mom... No! Don't you understand? He shouldn't come here. When you see him, you'll know. Let me introduce him to you. If you tell him to come, Dad will come here. You want to make me laugh? Please, Mom! Please tell him to come and rest here! Please do me this favour! On my life! On your life'? It's no big deal. You think I'm cruel, because you only think about him. VWI you think about me sometime? After Dad gets well, I'll be good to you. So please do me this favour. You win. Tomorrow... the day after tomorrow... I'll come in the evening. - Thank you! - I don't want to... but if it's for you... But I can't guarantee. You will come'? Didn't I say so'? But you... you should get a fashionable hairstyle. And some rouge. She wasn't there. Not there'? What for'? She went to Enoshima for worship. She left on the 29th, with the mistress of lsekyu. 29th'? That's the day after I came! She said she'd go on the next clay or the clay after. Masa from the villa said so. It'll take 7 days, to and fro. Mastertold you to join him for the New Year greeting.

I planned to wait until I save 1,000 ryo, but I saved only 870. V\/hytell me this? It's for you. I planned to leave this place with you and with the 1,000 ryo. Then start a new business. It's from my share of the profit, and some other money Sono is a bad woman. I don't want to leave you with her. Dad. Listen. I worked and suffered a lot. If it weren't for the dead master, vvho asked me to look after here, and you, I'd have left long ago. If I did, things would be much worse. Stop this. I hate hearing this! Listen, just some more. Less than 1,000.. You can still start a business. If I... If I'm gone... - take the money and go with Tokujiro... - Stop this! I'll be frank. I'm dying. I knew it when I collapsed on New Year's Eve.

He gave up his life for Musashiya. What's his joy in this life? Only hardships. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Ifs too much! She's too cruel! Oh God. Don't let him die. Make my life shorter. Take some of my days. Just don't let him die. So she's not in Enoshima'? She didn't go. She stayed here with Yoshiiya's mistress until yesterday Then where did she go'?

Makes no difference now. I'll go myself. Don't. Stay here. I'll tell Tokujiro to go again. Tomorrow. You or him. Mom, come home. Come home! Never saw such a patient! Honestly his body is already dead. But his heart is going strong. He's alive by sheer will. Miss. Master said to take him to Kameido. If she won't come, I'll go! I must... tell her this thing before I clie. The doctor said it's impossible. On a stretcher. I won't... die before telling her. Please! Shino! In such a state, you'll just suffer. I don't care. For 20 years... it's been a living death! I'll go there. Please! Dad. Are you in pain'? Shall I wrap your neck? What'? Soon. Hang on! One thing. - To her. - What'? One thing. While I'm alive...

How about my meal? I'll do it. Are you staying? That man, you don't mind'? It's OK. More people the better. We'll sleep in the stove. He's Kikutaro, an apprentice of Harimaya. She's the daughter that I talked about. Shino. Nice to meet you. Let's drink again! It's so cold! When it snows, it's so hard to walk on the road. Shino, get in the stove. Sit here. Sit here and warm up... warn up the saké. Seems like fun to sleep together! From my first impression, Shino is a resolute person. She has a sense of purpose. Oh! You have a crush on her'? Yes! She's now in my heart. - You're drunk! - It hurts! Ouch! You're so naughty! Shino. Shino. Shino. Kikutaro is sleeping. What are you doing'? Smells so bad! Who's sleeping there'? Dad. Stop kidding. He's too sick to come here. Dad... wants to tell you one thing. That's why we brought him here. He died on the way Died? Dead? Oh! It's not true! Let go of me! I don't vvant a dead body here! Calm clown and listen to me! Let me go! _ Mom! ' Let Don't you know you're wrong? What I did see... is for 20 years, Dad worked to his death for Musashiya. He didn't go to plays. No pleasure trip. Perhaps not for you, but it's for Musashiya for sure! You should have treated him as your husband! You're still young. - That's why... - I'm young but I know a lot! Since he fell sick 3 years ago, what did you do'? You... Who are you talking to'? Before New Year I told you he's critical. I begged you to come see him. You promised to. You remember'? I said so to get rid of you. And you take such a boy with you to Hakone! No. I went to Enoshima with lsekyu's mistress. Shut up! I asked her myself! She told me to ask Sakichi, then he told me. Oh... you did a lot. Dad collapsed on New Year's Eve. The doctor said this time he's dying. To tell you that Dad's dying, that's why I looked for you! You traced me! So bad! Bad'? How about you? You played with men while your husband's dying! That's not bad'? Even if I explain to you, you won't understand. It's a mistake to marry this man! He's hardworking. But he's such a boring man. He's so bland! He doesn't know a woman's feeling! Mom! Listen. A woman... wants a man who'd abandon everything... and loves her head over heels! If not for the store or the wealth, - he won't... - You're wrong. You're just going to plays, playing with actors, - drinking, eating, doing what you like... - Yes! You'll understand... - when you're a woman. - You're selfish! You're so cruel to Dad! Now he's dead, you still say he's dull! Tasteless! Boring! Dad... he's so pitiful! You shouldn't feel so sad about him. Now I'll tell you. He's not your real father. What'? You don't know what you're saying! I know. Your real father... isn't him. Mom. Such stupid talk! Some more. Seeing you're so sad about him, I'm telling you the truth. When I married him, you're already inside my body It's a bit shameful. I made a mistake with a big store owner and got pregnant. He's married and has kids. If people knevv, it'd be bad for both stores. So my father... in exchange for this store, convinced this man to marry me. Of course this man knew about you. Is this... true'? Can I joke about this? If you don't believe me, go and ask him. - Your real father... - No! Don't tell me. Go away! Go away? I have things to think about. Please go away! OK. Let's drink! Another round! So cold! You're bad! Mom's blood is flowing in me. Dirty! She's dirty! My body too! Dirty! One thing. To her. What'? One thing. Before I die. Dad. You knew. All. You knew, but you treated me like your own daughter. Camellia. Blooming near a small pond. You told me to go there. I will, soon. Show me the way I'll die after I kill Mom. Shame of women. Shame of all humans. So dirty! It shouldn't stay this way Someone has to pay! Someone. I can't die now. There are other men. Yes! Those who committed adultery with Mom and humiliated Dad. These men have to pay! End of Part One Part Two Those camellia murders, a shamisen player and a doctor were killed. - Is the murderer caught? - Any suspect? It's a pretty girl with fair skin, what a waste! - Kill me too! - Fool! V\Ath your face? - My daughter? - You're mistaken! - Get them in. Hey! It's not her. She may go. - Mom! - Daughter! That girl won't hurt a fly Not a murderer. That's the 3rd suspect. We won't ever get her. I sensed nothing. She killed two men in their prime, there must be something that could be sensed. A flat hairpin. The same method. Victims are all infamous men. The murderer must be a woman. One more thing. Red camellia. "Take it. Do some business." Yes. 50 ryo. I'm not related to her. Why gave me such money'? Big trouble. All the lOUs are gone. It's on the news board. How happy are the debtors! I don't understand. Why gave him 50 ryo? The I O Us. Perhaps that's not the aim. Killing the men is the goal. S fill, such young, and exceptional beauty... WW? Why kill those men one after the other? I don't understand. Yes. Thanks. - The woman? - Yes. - Looks alike? - Not alike. It's the same person. - Everyone says so. - When Chyodayu was killed, it was the same maid. They may forget it, but I remember very well. That woman? Hairstyle and clothing have changed, but the body face and voice can't change. - Sure'? - Yes! I looked after her that night, it must be Riu. Someone came after. But I didn't see what happened. I took leave today and came to visit my sister here. Then I saw her at the corridor. I'm shocked! I want to look at her in secret. Yes. Just a moment. Well... If she's really Riu, any reward for us'? You want a reward'? No... I work hard, still I can't buy a new kimono for my daughter. I'm just a country girl... If she's not the one, you'd disturb an innocent person, you may be punished. I took a day's leave, just to help you. How could you... - Yes, yes. - I'm serious! OK. You'll get a reward if she's the one. It's ready This way please. I changed her room. I'll take you to the room next to it. It's a "special interest" room. I'm revealing a secret... It's a picture on that side. Be careful when you look. No. Not a murderer. Well...

Rin a murderer'? That's impossible! Yes, she's a men's killer... Seiichi! No! ISEYA No. My daughter is called Soi. She's my only daughter She just got married. My grandson will be born soon. It must be a mistake. OK. But this Rin... you know someone like her'? Your daughter's friend? A neighbour'? There are 2 or 3 friends... - Who are they? - Yes. There are 2 of them in this area, both unmarried. And the drugstore's daughter. It's called Musashiya. - Musashiya'? - She's called Shfno. We're best friends from childhood. But she died in January You're back. Shichizo! Come with me. That girl lied! RIN TEA INSTRUCTOR I didn't notice it 2 days ago. I was so busy at work. She's smart. Terribly smart. She moved out yesterday morning. She came and said goodbye, said she's moving back home. No one knew she had that plan. - We're going to Kavvaracho. - Now? That man lives there. Better hurry Come in! Sorry to disturb you. Is Seiichi Koya here'? His home said he's here. He came'? V\/hen'? - Just then... - He didn't come. He didn't. He was at the door. We threw him on the ground. He won't ever come again. Then where is he'? Anybody know? - His friend... - Friend? She's about 20, pretty... That woman! She gave us her dowry, 2,000 mo. She told usto take it and forgive that man. That lustful man. Is she Rin? Yes. She's called Rin. She's showy! “Ifs for the funeral.“ How admirable! Are we beggars? Hey! Stop it! Kavvaracho. He may not be back. - Is the deceased working here? - Yes, she's one of us. - She hanged herself at the temple. - Shut up! Why keep this a secret? - That dandy killed her! - Shut up! You officials won't give a damn? Tell me more. Yes. V\1aka vvas the top geisha of this area 5 years ago. That Seiichi... is a dandy and fools around. They got together, that's fate. She gave him money She ran up debts so she had to sell herself cheap. Such story happens all the time. Seiichi vvas here that day but forgot all about it! 5 years ago? Listen well, sir. No one can get lower than this. It's hell! No. Hell may be better. Sorry madam. But sir, it's possible to get out of this life. Like chess. She hopes to do so. She worked hard to pay her debts. She's looking forward to marry him when she clears her debts next spring. But he... heard about her somewhere. They told him she's not pretty anymore, like an old woman! Then he did a beastly thing. He brought 5 friends here and asked for her. 5 men in just a moment! Cruel! When she saw his face, she was so shocked! She realized his wickedness and turned pale instantly Long time no see. You're popular. Which is the best? This one? This one? Tell us. We're waiting to hear it. How bad you are! Wbka! Wbka! Then she's gone, we were all looking for her. In the yard of the temple... "Wéka! "Wéka! Wbka! Poor girl! You fool! That beast! The thing that he did! If he's a beast, just treat him like a beast! You're stupid! Why kill yourself? Fool! He's scum. He may be killed. I must hurry. That girl is smart. She'll kill again. Unbelievable. To kill someone... she must have felt something. But it won't be her. Impossible. Rm is just a disguise. But who's that girl? - Afire! - Afire! Afire! Musashiya. That Kameido fire. Parents and daughter perished. So... lseyafs daughter's best friend. Musashiyafs daughter. A strange incident. Not just the critical patient, but the healthy wife ancl daughter too. That's why... I investigated it. The bodies? Burnt to bones. The doctor identified two bodies, one man and woman. And a smaller body with young bones. So he thought it's the daughter. Burnt to bones? Because of oil. Lots of lighting oil in the storeroom. Musashiya is a drugstore, but they sell oil as well. Here's the sketch of the scene. Oil. Drunk mother. Tired daughter. Very sick father who can't move. The maid on leave after dark. Nothing suspicious. But... too many coincidences. I want to look into it. Oh'? Mr. Aoki. - Killed? - Him. Red camellia. The victim is 34, 35 years old. The scene is an inn called Yamatoya. - Men'? - Just then. Shall we talk to Mr. Uchimura, your superior? This is the third man. I've let you take full charge of this case. Yes. Fine if you know this. Tell me more. Cheer up. You're still down'? He's your superior, of course he'd give you that look. - It's strange. - Stop and eat! I'm chasing the murderer, but that Seiichi... is so hateful! Notjust hateful, he's despicable! Not just because he fools around. I too, play sometimes. But while he's having fun, he trampled on honest people. It's natural for him to get killed. Hey! You shouldn't say this. This thing... her killing such people, is considered to be right. If I don't arrest her soon enough, she will commit more crimes. I want to stop all this. Kasai, am I too naive? No... Is she very beautiful? - You have a crush. - No! - Read this. - What is this? I didn't show it to Uchimura. It was found at the scene. It's addressed to me. Stabbed to death. With this. Hairpin. It's for you, Mr. Aoki. I'll turn myself in and tell you everything. Now I can only say this. This is a crime not punishable by the law of this world. Rin. Not punishable by this law. Soon, Dad. Soon. Wait for me. There are still men that should be punished. Those who trampled on you. Crimes not punishable by this law. It was close. It was real close. Long time no see! I saw you before at the shop in Nakacho. You're Riu? I stopped breathing. H's stuck at my throat. My eyesight turned dark. But he saw it! His gaze was like a needle pricking me. Is she the one? Yes! She's the one! Be honest! You know this maid? I committed no crimes! Are those murders? If they are, then are they crimes? If so, I'd have felt it. To take away someone's life is a frightful thing. But I don't feel I committed a crime. V\/hy'? Look at this hand! It's not at all dirty! There's no blood stain, nor any smell! Dad! Wait for me! Soon. Dad! Give me strength! Dad! Miss! Get a grip! Please get up! Geta grip! MUSASHIYA I'm a relative. It's a pity to see this store close down. So I came back and took over this place. Don't ask me about the mistress. She and the master are dead. I don't vvant to badmouth them. Please forgive me. Some left this place. Tokujiro started his own store. Also Masa who helped at the villa. And you see who's still here. I don't care about the mistress, but I feel sad about Shino. Not yet 20. Very beautiful. A very well behaved girl. You pity Shino and her father. But not the mistress, why? I can't say it. But it's a punishment from heaven. To die like that! Tell me more about her. She had someone else? Well... She always had someone. Dig up the graves'? To do what? Look at the bones. Dr. Saito will look at them. No... I'm not doubting you, but I want to look into it. For what? I investigated... the mistress. She's a nymph. She had lots of men from early on. This is Shino, vvho was also dead. Her real father... is not this man. There are rumours. And? V\Ath such a complicated background, the fire won't be so simple. But the whole family is dead. How could the girl be involved in this? I don't know. Suppose... the dead Shino... is alive'? Hey! Is this a ghost story? But it fits many clues. The shamisen player... the bad doctor... were involved with the mistress. And Sakichi, the teahouse worker, comes in the picture. This kind of person... is right at the centre of actors, artists and dandies. He vanished since summer. If we find him, he'd be very useful. You win, then you leave'? Sure! Bastard! Where did you get such a job'? 1 ryo per month'? 1 ryo pays for 1 girl and 1 cat. Or a kept woman. Is he a kept man? Sakichi! I'm looking for Sakichi! He used to work at the teahouse. Is he here? - That man... - Sakichi? - Sorry but he's left. - He came'? Where is he staying? Somebody knows? He's the lonely type. You want him for what'? Stupid! You don't know how to lie'? Ifs hot. Is my body hot? Your skin smells good, Yone. Wherever it gets dark, I get so distressed. It feels so hot in my body I'll be dead soon. '(one. So beautiful! The autumn moon! Don't make such a face. '(one. Tell me the truth. Who are you'? Why keep me waiting? You promised you won't ask who I am. I love you. We meet when we want to. That's enough. We'll separate. Well then. Goodbye, that's the end. Fool! I'm angry! We're man and woman. You don't understand. We can't get married. A woman can't just make a clean break like a man. It's hard for a man to wait like this. So... Actually I... tonight... Excuse me. - Yes. - Is your guest Mr Maruume? - Yes. - What's the matter? Someone wants to see him. She's Tsuru, taking two kids with her. How could she! Tell her I'm not here. She said she followed you here. Tell her to wait. He'll come. No! I won't! Tell her to wait. What are you thinking? You must have made her cry Who is she'? Made her cry? Don't think so dirty A teahouse waitress. The devil got me. When my wife was off for a spa cure, I need a woman, so it's natural to play with a waitress. Now what? I'm angry! She's taking me from you! There's no need to see her. I'm so stupid! All women are, at such times. I am, anyWEW I was just 16, just arrived from the countryside. It could be happiness or misery I thought I could just wait for him. He told me to be patient. I thought I could. He rented a place for me. A servant too. I was well supported for a year. He bought me clothes and stuff. I felt that's a woman's happiness. But the rootless life of a kept woman... Then he stayed away The money stopped. When I had this child last year, he said it wasn't his. "I only came once a month." "I knew you have other men. I have witnesses!" I'm rootless... I made up my mind to confront him. This is all I have. I have no place to stay These are just a man's excuses. I know. I could still support myself by taking jobs. But I can't when I was pregnant. I stayed in storerooms. I sold my kimonos. I did some handiwork until I gave birth. But... it's so tough. Someday we'll starve to death. I thought of going back home and raise them. I did. But with these two, I have nothing to contribute to my brother's family And this is embarrassing in the country So, I plucked up my courage this very last time. I went to Maruume. Did he see you'? No. The mistress came out, saying he's not home. Then she scolded me. "You ungrateful bitch!" I can take any humiliation. I won't talk back. But... saying that their mother is a bitch in front of them! And spat at me! But she didn't cry When vve left, this child made me squat down, and wiped the spit off my hair. At that time, hovv I wanted to die! I only thought about dying once. I gave up that thought right away I won't die no matter what! I won't die for him! Stop crying- You must be strong from now on. Raise them well. Show him what you can do! This. A gift. Go home. Just take it. Why? You don't know me! So much money! I don't need this money So... Are you OK'? Nothing. I'm OK. Be a good kid. Can you'? A promise. Thank you! But who are you, really? At least tell me your name. You're a woman, lam too. That's enough. What's wrong? Why cry now? Don't cry in front of them. Don't! Sorry Sorry! Don't apologize! L... really... still miss him. I miss him. Somewhere deep in my heart. But no more now. Not a bit. Thank you for being so kind. First time in my life! How stupid I was! Women are stupid, really Why did I think he's reliable? He's not the reliable type. In bed, he talked about the women he's had, in vivid details. He once made a drugstore's daughter pregnant. Her father married her off in a hurry The child was born as the child of the son-in-law. So cruel! But he made fun of it. He's a beast! Which... store is it'? It is in Hongoku, Nihonbashi. You knew it'? Such a cruel story I even remember the name. Musashiya. What is it'? What is it'? Dear! That's not your dad. He's my dad! That beastly man! No! She gave a strict order. Until the fever's gone, she'll see no one. But it's been 5 days! It lasted that long! It has nothing to do with it. She won't see you. Stubborn girl! Oh. You're up. You OK'? Do you know a detective Aoki'? - He knew something. - What'? He's digging up the bones. He said the Kameido fire is suspicious. Master was sick. Mistress was drunk. Not you. Why couldn't you run'? That's why he wants to see the bones. He took a forensic expert to the temple. Today they'll... I must hurry. If I don't... So unlucky A blood-coloured sunset. - Is Sakichi here'? - What'? Yes. The boat is ready You're drunk'? It's cold. It'll be colder out there. I drank a bit. But not drunk. How about Maruume'? No. Shino, let's talk about this tonight. Maruume won't run away - Row it. - Yes. I thought he wouldn't find anything with the bones. But experts are experts. They know their job. They found what? When the forensic doctor saw your bones, he shook his head. "Not a woman." “ifs a young person.“ “But a man's hipbone.“ "After a girl gets 16 or 17," "the hipbone would be different." "it'll get wide like this." "So the hip and thighs get bigger." "But this is a young man aged 16 or 17." Shino. It's the end. Kikutards parents have been looking for him. They'll soon know he's involved with the mistress. Chyodayu. Tokuseki. Seiichi Koya. - They'll know... - You too. What a nerve. Time is running out. They're looking for me. Shino, you... paid me to help you. But I've done nothing myself. Even they interrogate me, it makes sense to believe that I know nothing. Really? Really? Hey you... You did nothing'? Not true'? Not true. You not only helped me, you helped Mom too. No. Other mistresses too. Many artists and actors. Rich dandies. - Yes? ' Wilit! Don't say so. How many were betrayed and cried because of you? You caused misery My family too! You can't blame a beggar for having sores. When one drifts off the road, it's natural to be punished. Hate yourself. I didn't plan to tell you this. Shino. L... vvant to live and die with you. I've been loving you so long. I'm an insignificant man! Bottom of the pile! You're the flower that I can't pluck! I can just peep! I can't even look at you! But... but... it's different now. We're in the same hole! If I'm filthy then how about you? You're a bloody wolf! - No... - It's closing in on you! You must leave Edo! You're just 20. You lived a sheltered life. You can't go on your own. - So... - I understand. Is this what you want to talk about? No, it isn't. What I meant... is to... marry you. You'll need a travel pass to leave Edo. A couple can get it easier. And I... I've been loving you madly! I said I understand. I was going to propose this. - What'? - Your hand... your hand. So soft! This... how did you use it'? I can testify against you. We could die together on the scaffold, as lovers. No! Blackmailing me'? Sorry You won't kill me. I know it's suspicious. No woman would give herself to me without reason. Yes? No violence! The rower. He won't. He went ashore. Stop it! Hey! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Let go! No! Put out the light. Shadows. It hurts! It was you who introduced the men to Mom! The pain... more of it... Feel my dad's pain! This is the 4th one. When vvill she stop? Frightful woman. Made my hair stand on end. Whatever the motive, I can't sympathize with her. Avillain! No! She's not human! A demon! Sorry! Miss Shino is alive! For some time she lived in Kanda. One month after she moved away without telling me. Then I lost her trace. Sorry to hide it from you. Miss Shino asked me to wait for a year. She'll contact me next year. Until then, say nothing. It was 37 days after the Kameido fire. A letter was sent to me without a sender's name. It was from her. She said the dead master liked me. He wanted me to help Miss Shino. And told me this and that. Why no sender's name, what is she going to do, she said nothing. The 870 ryo that the master left for Shino, I brought it out secretly in two trips. What is she going to do with it... she won't tell me. She told me to treat her as dead, and asked me to ask no more. Later she moved away without telling me. I left Musashiya in May and started my store. I never forget Shino. That Shino is the one behind all these murders... and started the fire in Kameido, I can't believe it! You made a mistake! She's kind and considerate. She won't do such things! Camellias'? There is one in the Kameido villa. But no relation. You're still here'? Camellia is a spring flower. There's winter camellia in winter. There's an autumn camellia too. When the flower drops, it's like a chopped head. This is probably the "Tama" or "Yachiyo" camellia. Yachiyds colour won't fade. It's a rare species. VWke up! Dictionary The camellia at the scene... could mean something. I thought you got crazy She's really not sane. She's out of her mind. Uchimura thought it's worse. The killed men were all involved with her mother. Is the girl so squeamish, so she plotted this revenge'? But that doesn't explain everything. There must be something more to that. That camellia... must be the clue to that obsession. Is it a request? A prayer? And... I'm sorry to get you, the authority in trouble. It's difficult to talk about the matter, so! Write it down. I can't forgive my mom. She bore a bastard child, I, being this child, feel so shameful. She's not home all day playing with men. She fooled around in the same house where her husband's body was lying. She sullied human morals and sincerity She threw them in mud and laughed at them. Can she be forgiven? H's a crime not punishable by this world 's law. But ifs unforgivable in human terms. Mom and the men who committed it, just one left. I might forgive Mom, but not this one. He's the most sinful one. What are you doing? Just some leftover for the beggars. What'? No leftover! Every grain of rice belongs to the master! Chase them away! Throw salt at them! Go away! Away; You bring misfortune! What is it'? You naughty girl. I was dazed when I first met you. But real happy I could give up my wealth for you. In fact, I came to see how your wife and kids are living. It's me who should be angry You won't let me have you. You were so cruel and just left. V\flthout telling me. Tsuru told me about you. That's enough to cool me down. Fool! Men will promise you everything. Your wife and kids live an unhappy life. But you just enjoy yourself. Are you evading me again? I told Tsuru to go home. I gave her something, but not much. Two cute children. I didn't feel that they were strangers. Gave them something? Money? It's not your business. She has a tough life before her. She might make her kids die with her. But that's fine! You don't feel a thing anyway - Shut up! - Sorry... Let's drink! You have lots of women other than her'? After having your fun, you threw them out like cats! It's only the man's fault? Love and sex are just sparks of the moment. The fun... is much more enjoyed by the woman. So why blame us men? But it's the woman who suffers after the fun. Tsuru might suffer for her whole life. But you won't feel a thing and just go home. You play in secret. Have you ever thought you're wrong? Your moods are bad tonight. L... am leaving you tonight. You're drunk. You turn has come. My 'turn'? Yes. It has been the women who suffer. Now it's your turn to suffer. You don't care'? After tonight, you will just leave next morning'? - Somebody may come... - Ignore them. I know here well. Yes? Well! Get me up. OK. - Oh no! - Why? Change first. Yone! Ready? Vhéit. Don't tie it on. Let me! Now's the time! No! No! - I said no! - V\/hy'? At this time? You love me. You can't leave me. Am I... beautiful? Yes. More than Sono'? Sono of Musashiya, in Hongoku'? Musashiya? Sono'? Think. Remember? Long time ago... 20 years? Stupid girl! Somebodytold you'? You had a daughter with her'? Tell me, you're the father of her daughter? Yes? I said it's long time ago! So it's true. You're her father? Answer me! Is it true'? Yes. Who told you'? Why not let me tell you'? I know some more. You were married when you were involved with Sono'? Musashiya had to get a son-in-law quickly to cover this up. The head clerk, Kihei. He said yes. He would take the responsibility And that's not all. You did some more bad things! After she gave birth, you were still seeing each other! V\Ath Sakichi as go-between. Relax. These three are all dead. The dead won't talk. The fire in Kameido. You know so much... And things you don't know! They dug up the bones of the Kameido fire victims. What was thought to be Shino, is actually a teenage man! Man'? And... So stupid! Yes! Shino is alive! But Musashiya had a funeral for three persons! If she's alive, why doesn't she turn up'? You heard? Since November, men are being murdered. The suspect is a 20-year-old girl. The weapon is a silver hairpin. And she left a camellia. The four men killed were all involved with Sono. The 4th man is Sakichi, your go-between to Sono. The night her husband died, the drunk Sono said, "This is not your father." "You're a bastard daughter." It was all new to Shino! Her father said he wanted to tell Soho something before he died. Why didn't Shino know it then'? Her father had been keeping this secret from her. He knew she'd be hurt and sad if she knew. Until his last breath, Shino noticed nothing! How come you know this in such detail'? Shino told you'? Shino loved her father more than any daughter in the world. When she knew she's a bastard, and what her father wanted to say before dying, she couldn't forgive her mother... and the men who betrayed her father. So Shino told you all this. She's really alive. You know her'? Where is she'? At the crime scene, she left a camellia. Sure you know this? Camellia... was her father's favourite flower. He had no hobbies. This is his only consoling. The murderer... Stupid girl! - It's her! - Yes! Shino killed them! Shino? I'm Shino. Your daughter. Hold me! Touch my breasts! Love me tonight! No! Shino! No! Stop this! To me you're a beast. You chase after your daughter and get her in bed. I'll kill you beast! What'? Hold me! Sleep with me! You won't'? Forgive me! I changed my mind. I won't kill you. I'll let you live in pain! I will now turn myself in. I'll tell them everything. Setting the Kameido fire. Killing Mom and Kikutaro. What'? You'? They were drunk and asleep. I poured oil around the whole house. Then I set the fire and watched it burn! - You're just scaring me... - I'm not lying! L, your daughter, burnt my mother to death! Then I killed 4 men! The world will know... you're the father of this cruel murderer! You're just scaring me'? Me... me... You'll suffer! This is worse than death! You'll suffer until you die! You committed adultery The daughter from that affair will be executed for murder! The world will know! You'll suffer until you die! A lie! It's impossible! Impossible! Don't do this! If you're really Shino, don't die like that! I won't let you! I've sinned. But I won't let you die! So... let's talk about it. Talk about it'? Please! Please sit clown! Please listen to me! Shino! Live. You're young and pretty You'll be happy if you live. Shino, don't turn yourself in. Just don't turn yourself in! I'll do anything to atone. So please listen to me! I'm a murderer! I killed my own mother! How will I be happy? You think it was nothing'? Your suffering begins now. And you vvill suffer from now on! L... I will stop you with all my power! Try with all your power. I will turn myself in. I'll get the police here and tie me up! A prisoner to be executed. By the order of Mr. Sagakibara, get me the female prisoner... Chyo, age 28, wife of Yasugoro. For killing her father, we'll take you for show in Edo, then we'll execute you. Take her! Incredible girl. Even the most wicked criminals, facing a looming execution, will get depressed. They'll lose their appetite. But that girl gets prettier. She took the doctor's medicine smoothly She doesn't look like someone to be crucified. - So, crucifixion'? - It's unavoidable. We're waiting for the orders from above. Maybe 5, 6 days. What about her real father? Marrume is a renowned store. It has closed its doors. He never came out. I see. In fact, just then... someone above asked me to reduce the punishment. I can't spare her life. If we trace back, that plea comes from him. A father's love. But don't tell her about this. If the ministry... decide that the law doesn't apply in this case, how would they find a verdict'? Well... they'll judge by past cases. What if there's none'? Then they'd make a different interpretation of the law. They'll take the motive and the impact into account. Is that good'? The present law is in force for 70 years. The social structure and living habits... are all different now. Can this law be useful? Aoki. You're not allowed to criticize the ministry Look at this. She sewed this herself. A baby's clothes. An inmate of the cell next to hers is pregnant. No one asked her for this. The cloth came from her clothes. She's in peace. Let her die in peace. Every second matters to me. There are some babies here. I got lots of orders. They say it's pretty but I can't make money out of it. My clothes from home will be here tomorrow. I know it's not right, but can I keep the needles and scissors at night'? There's not enough time. I could finish this one tonight. It's bad for your health if you work at night. No. I stop coughing and the fever is gone. My health gets better since I came. The right place for me! I spend such busy days here. I didn't expect it. Doing this makes me so happy And people are so nice to me. I feel that this is a recuperation trip. Isn't it strange? A condemned person like me. Honestly I'm looking forward to my execution. Like when I'm a kid, counting dovvn the days before New Year. Say something. Today you told me nothing from the outside. The jailer talked about a giant weasel in Ryogoku. What big weasel? What is it'? You're funny I can't make such a face. No... Sorry if I offended you. I'll come again. Don't forget the needle and scissors. Maruume's wife hanged herself! - Sorry - Really? Last night. I went to inspect the body Her husband was like a soulless body sitting under the dangling body Shall we tell Shino'? Now... better not. I agree. I have something to do. That girl... didn't think about this. Sorry to disturb you. This is your case, so we want you to know. Shino. It's me. Can you see'? Get some rest. Lie down. L... am wrong? Crimes not punishable by law, but unforgivable in human terms. I took matters in my hand, and became a judge outside of the law. I'm shameful! Unpunishable by law, but the criminal has to pay for it himself. Kill him. Threaten him. Still the crime isn't paid for. Yes? I don't know what to say But you really have to do this, right'? Yes? If so, don't regret it. But... Mrs. Maruume... is dead. She... hanged herself. It has nothing to do with you. - You don't have to... - No. That's not true. That's not true. Up to now, I felt no remorse of what I did. But I felt horrified when I knew her death. I used to think what I did is guiltless. But somebody else got hurt! I can feel the pain of Mrs. Maruume. She spat on the woman who took away her husband. She cared for him! She shouldn't die! She shouldn't! Shino! Get a grip! Shino! I'm so scared! You're so hot! I felt like dying after I killed Mom. I'm afraid to die! I got scared just to think of it! What would I... Jailer! Jailer! - A doctor! - V\/hatvvould I... Shino! Get a grip! I'm so scared! Please leave. Shino. Shino. Bad news! Dead? V\Ath the scissors. Poor girl. She cried all night. Left neck. 1 inch under the ear. Artery is out. This came last night. Nice. Put this on her. Here. THE END
