From where is this ringing? Dhanya! Dear Dhanya! What? -Phone for your dad. Dad is taking bath, mom. You go & give him the phone. I'll be back now. Here. -Hello! Who is on the line? Dominic uncle! My dad is taking bath in a water falls. Uncle! Call up after 5 minutes. I'll give the phone to my dad at that time. Dad! Dominic uncle called you from your office. He will call up now also. Oh! These guys don't work self. What, Dominic? I'm performing a site inspection in the 6th ward here. How can be there a water falls in 6th ward? In that case assume as 11th ward. Why do you smile, man? Building inspector! It's enough if you stay in that position. If you play with A.T.P, you will face the consequences. I don't need your sorry. You tell me the matter. Is that Kuwait man's house? That is built full if violation. I'll inspect there according to my convenience. I'll decide my needs. I'll destroy his house if its needed. Did you only tell Dominic as I was taking bath in water falls? Should I not tell him, dad? Did you tell him where we are now? -I didn't tell him that. Dad! You went into the water without taking leave in your office. Right? Shall we go? Dhanya has to practice music. There are only 4 days for youth festival. Music teacher will come by 6 O'clock. No. Where are our jeep and that Joker? Oh no! Sir! Has your bath got over? It's over. It's enough if you start the jeep now. You come here. You've earned taking tourists in the Government jeep, when I was not here. Right? Who told you? -I've seen you getting money from tourists. If the jeep is idle here, it's not useful for anyone. So... So... You'll use the Government jeep as your taxi. Right? Can you go for picnic by Government jeep. Right, sir? You'd remember that you are not a permanent driver. If I think, I'll spoil your job. Keep our items into the jeep, man. Sir! You've called me as bloody fool. Right? You spoke without any respect on me in front of my wife & daughter. I too feel a lot as you insulted me in front of them only. Everybody is winning the prize giving bribe to judges nowadays. Will you get me such a situation? My daughter doesn't need such a worst prize. My teacher has composed a very good, dad. If I get the music com petition prize money, can you get me the medical seat, dad? You'd write the entrance exam for that. If I don't get even after I write my entrance exam ...I asked whether you can get me or not. People ask 40 or 50 lakhs for a medical seat now. I'm not interested in Engineering or Computer. I too wanted to study in medical college in my young age. It didn't happen. So, it is a luck of patients. What did you say? I asked you why you didn't do medicine, then. I understood later on that I should a pass a pre degree to do medicine. Girija! What's your qualification? I studied in 8th standard for 4 or 5 years. But my body doesn't stay in the place, where I ask to stay. Teachers hesitated to teach a student, who studies so deeply in the same class. I was ready to study after that also. It means he didn't have common sense on that day itself. Sir! What did you say? I told that it is going to rain. I too felt it. Who is he? He doesn't give any respect after seeing a Government jeep also. Girija! -What? -Don't give way for haughty people. I agree this, sir. Leave him, Gopi dear. He may have some urgency. His urgency...! He'd understand the range of ATP officer's jeep. Right? -Then what? He is playing with us. No need, Girija. I can't leave him, ma'am. Idiot! Are you playing with a Government jeep? I want to see your haughty face. If I hit you, you'll get over. You didn't give me way, when I'm going to hospital with my wounded daughter. It's a public property. It's not your own property. Move, man. Gopi dear! -Dad! -Oh no! I'll call him to the court for damaging a Government jeep. Oh! I've forgotten to write his car number. If you file a case, they will ask why did you go to Tamil Nadu by Kerala Government jeep. We can catch him straightly in some other situation, sir. Our jeep's position has become very bad like a pregnant lady. Very bad. Greets, sir. Greets, sir. -Hey! Sir is very strict. He doesn't like greetings. Who is the owner of this property? -it's he, who is greeting you, sir. Is this a house? Aren't Parliament ministers coming here? How many people are staying in this house? 500 people...? 1000? Tell me. Sir! I built it according to the plan, what our corporation has approved. It means you are telling that I'd not reject it as an ATP officer. Okay. I won't reject it. But you don't come to me for a completion certificate. Don't try to trap our sir talking legally. He will finish you. Go & apologize to him. Why sorry? I'd have not approved this plan if I got it after I took charge here. Your house is there in the country, where crores of people don't have a shelter too. Pity people don't have water to wash a tea glass also. But you've built a wide swimming pool. Have you repaired the rain water harvesting system in your terrace? I'll repair it before rainy season, sir. Will the rain come asking your permission only.' You can't get the completion certificate in any way. First cement. Then Charcoal. Then sand. Again cement. Then net. You'd build such a system to purify the water. You hold it. You hold it in that corner. Hold it in the ground perfectly, man. You gave 38 feet in the plan. But you've built 40 feet. You'd break this wall completely. You'd build 2 feet inside. Sir! I don't know the calculations. When I gave for a contractor... -Don't tell anything. I will never agree the violation. You've spoiled everything. Pooja room...? Bathroom only should come here. Right? Pooja room should come there only. Right? He might be using that Pooja room as a bathroom, sir. Sir! Sorry. I made the Pooja room as bathroom according to our Vastu consultant. In that case, ask that man to give you a completion certificate. You've changed an experienced architect's plan according to Vastu or something. Sir! I'd go to Kuwait on this 4th. -If he goes to Uganda, it is good. What are these? These are waste things. This man doesn't have any problem in getting our certificate. Girija! Let's go. -Okay. It's become a great problem, sir. Don't under estimate our ATP sir. He is not a person, who can act against the rule. That man told that he would give us Rs.20,000. If he had told that in time, I'd have not spoken this much. Start the jeep. There was raining, when my son got down to go for school by today morning. Ramani asked me a question. You man! How can our son go to school without an umbrella? I told her at that time as we are pity. I asked him to go keeping a banana leaf on his head if we don't have an umbrella. There's no any word, which she didn't use in scolding me for it. There was a great storm in my family, when I went there last night. Electricity person removed our fuse & took away that. How can I blame him? Board is already in loss. If we don't pay our current bill also... My son asked me as how he can read in a small candle light. I told them that Abraham Lincoln studied in the street light only. He became an American president studying in that way. He tells that lf l promise him that I'll make him an American president... He will also study sitting in the street light. Sugar candy is Rs.45. I can't tell about provision items rates. I'd pay Rs.15 if I want to buy meals outside. If this continues, how can we survive? Why don't you tell anything, sir? Didn't you hear, what I told until now, then? What did you say? I told about my family's present situations. You'd be ready to agree that, sir. Kuwait man will give you Rs.20,000 by today noon. If it is 2% commission that you fixed, I'll get only Rs.400. That's not enough for anything. You'd pay me 5% at least, sir. In that case I'll get Rs.1000. Or I won't move further. Let us get that money first. You start the jeep, man. A cool feeling is there in my heart like the deer, which comes out in the Sun light. A soft thought, which is like somebody stretched their fingers with black die. When my skirt gets rubbed in the wet sand... Grass will enjoy singing and dancing while seeing that. Crops also will enjoy singing with desire. A cool feeling is there in my heart like the deer, which comes out in the Sun light. A soft thought, which is like somebody stretched their fingers with black die. My playful friend, who asked me a riddle! If you forget your tears itself... If you forget your pleasureful pain also in that... When I lied to you, beautiful moon also got disappeared which took fruits. Colourful parrot's dream also has gone. Cool moon has got disappeared. Rainy night has gone. Cool moon has got disappeared. Rainy night has gone. A flower whose desire has not get satisfied by the affection... It cried seeing the Sun. Asking him to show his face again. A flower whose desire has not get satisfied by the affection... It cried seeing the Sun. She stood with semi stupor. It's a song, which nobody knows in a forest path. My desire is a hot moon, which can't get diminished. A cool feeling is there in my heart like the deer, which comes out in the Sun light. A soft thought, which is like somebody stretched their fingers with black die. When my skirt gets rubbed in the wet sand... Grass will enjoy singing and dancing while seeing that. Crops also will enjoy singing with desire. Dhanya is angry on you. What's the problem? She has got the prize money for her music. Right? Your didn't promise her regarding her medical seat even after this. It's her complaint. Let her write her entrance exam first She doesn't have a great hope in that. If I promise her now itself, she will write her entrance exam badly. If she doesn't get good percentage in entrance, can you get her a medical seat? You don't tell her this. Shouldn't you arrange lakhs of money for that seat? I can arrange lakhs of money if we need it, Raja Lakshmi. How? Oh. You're getting bribe for that only, right? Who told you that I am getting bribe? My friend Sathidevi, who studied with me in 10th standard, told me one day. Hey! Your hubby Gopi is getting bribe, right? She told me to give her also. Didn't you reply her for this? Should I reply for it? You fool! We are helping our clients, who come regarding construction works. They are giving us their compliments for that. Can we call that as a bribe? Government is paying you the salary for that job only, right? You lady!Job is different and help is different. Can Government pay me the salary for my problems? I made 3 operations for my dad last year. He was in hospital for 6 weeks. I spent 12 lakhs. Did Government give me that money? For how many lakhs we purchased in last grand Kerala Shopping festival? Even if it is only 2 years since I came to this post... I've done these things. Right? I need to help some people for that. I will get their compliment also. That is not called as a bribe. Oh! Is it so? You lady! I'll tell you something else. Getting money secretly is called as bribe. It's not like that. We do this by understanding mutually. Politicians. Police. Vigilance. Including ministers. I'm a binomee of many people. Do you know how many people's treasure keys are there in my hands? Tell me now. Am la person, who is getting bribe? No. -Oh! Accept like that. Get me something to drink. My throat has become dry by talking with you. It's enough if you give it in that counter. -Okay, sir. -Go, then. Sir! What's this? India is not even developing because of this only. Intelligent people will form a queue in such a place. People! You'd go & watch in Europe & America. You pay us the flight ticket. We will go & watch it. Look him. -I won't get anybodys application if you don't stand in queue. Ifs a corporation office. Not a fish market. Don't create confusion. Everybody is having necessity. Stand in queue. I'm asking you only to stand in queue. Sir! Can I meet your ATP today at least? I'm walking here and there because of you people only. Government has created the building construction rules. Panchayat & Corporation can't give permit to even small houses. We can't be able to fix the permit fees. This is not my problem. Right? This is our problem. Right? I've told your matter to our sir yesterday itself. You just wait. Let me tell him again & see. Greets. -Greets. Sir! Did you break that marriage hall? Shall I ask you a question, sir? As we don't know any gazzetted officer till now... Which evidence is there to prove me & Srikumari as married couples? That too 2 gazzzetted officers. This country is full of rules, which betray people. Oh! Is that a marriage certificate matter? That can be a simple matter for you, sir. But I am struggling in between life and death, sir. I didn't create this rule. Sir! Can you give me a solution for this? Let me finish this work. I'll call you. You'd call me soon, sir. -Okay. Next person. Where should I submit the house building application? Token number 16. Token number 17. Where should I submit the house building application? This long queue is there for that only. Go & stand there. Sir! You've given all the documents. Right? Everything is there, sir. You just see my particulars. Plot lay out is okay. Building plan okay. Sir!-You...? -I'm Sukumaran. Not that. How can you say that it's not my name? No.l am asking... How did you come in front of me? You man! Everybody is friends in front of all of us. We can't be able to differentiate anybody. Come. There's time. Let's discuss everything later on. What can we discuss? Do you think everybody as a fool? If you sing for some more time, I can build a stage for you. You'd pay Rs.50 there. You'll get a token at that time. If you come, when your token number comes, I'll give you your receipt. If it passes soon before the rainy season, it will be good. I want to do the house warming ceremony. If it delays, we can prepare butter milk. Who is next? -You go. Be careful. You'll break this it seem s. Why do you laugh? -Token number 26. This man's trick was wonderful. Did you watch it, brother? I've no other way. I have to go my daughter's school and pick up her. If I stand in this queue, she'd be there in her school only until night. Brother! Did you also come to get the house building permit? I can't tell you about that. Astrologer told me that my time is bad. But I've understood that it is very bad after coming here only. A small alteration in my home. Just a slope. it will be only 600 square feet. But I renewed my permit little late. They've asked its explanation now. lf it is not up to their satisfaction, they'll break it. Should you break it and alter it? Then... money, which you spent? -This is not a problem. It will take place if I give them bribe. I killed enemies for our country working in military for 27 years. Should I pay them bribe? Brother! Are you a military man? I am very glad in meeting you. I'm Sukumaran. Brother! How many people did you kill in military? What? Killing... -How can I count the expired people while attacking them? I could not kill anybody until now. Sukumaran! Are you working in military? No. I'd not be a military man only to kill a person. Right? That's not needed. It's enough if you become a thug. How many worst news we're seeing in the newspaper daily? But nobody is ready to kill this ATP here. ATP Or...? Who is that? Town planners are in leave. So, he is taking charge. If we want to see his face, we have to pay minimum Rs.500. Sukumaran! You've applied for your house permit. Right? You are going to meet him. -Let them be finished. Who asked you bribe? -No idiot has told me about it. If they ask me bribe, I have no money to pay it also. Your slippers will get rubbed like me, then. Yes. It's 10 years since Me & Srikumari got married. We got 2 children also. We went to Guruvayur to worship God. We took a room in a lodge. What can I tell about that bad time? There was a police raid suddenly. Police arrested me & my wife in prostitution case. How can they arrest a married couple in prostitution case? Police should believe us a married couple for that, right? They asked us our marriage certificate. They should give me that. I should get the signature of 2 gazetted officers in that. Register of our marriage hall. Our wedding photo. I'm asking these only here. What's there for it? Isn't it enough if we arrange these things? Can you get me these things? He is talking without knowing anything. They broke that marriage hall & altered that. No gazetted officer is signing telling that they don't know me. Our marriage photo has gone somewhere while shifting our house. What can I do? Sir! Here is the file. I told about the corruption king ATP, didn't I? It's he. Everything is there, sir. There are some mistakes. Head it & correct everything. -Okay, sir. Greets, sir. What a job did you do? Is that this man? -Sister! Don't beat me. What's going on here? -This man has broken my table, sir. Catch him, man. I've told you already, right? I'm very busy, dear. Understand...? Girija! Start the jeep. At present, jeep won't move. Has it got repaired again? No diesel. -You filled up diesel for Rs.200 yesterday only. right? But, it has gone somewhere. Are you filling diesel in our jeep? If you blame me like this, thunder will fall on your head. Watch it, then? Not like you. Thunder knows the truth. That will fall on my head only after falling on your head. Sir! Shall I call a car? Why.' -Sir! You told on that day as you want to inspect my house. I'll inspect your house in a convenient time. Why are you wasting your time staying here? Matters will take place in proper time. Let your turn come. I'll come & inspect at that time. Sir! Please show grace on me. Girija! If you have grace, show him. I'm a Government servant. I can't show grace on anyone. Leave the place. Fill the diesel and come. Only Rs.100...? Rs.10 is enough. Move away, man. Com e. Leave me down, dad. Leave me down. What should I leave you down? Leave me down. What's the problem? -My friends are teasing me. As what? -Somebody had seen you lifting me. They are asking me, am I a kid. You tell them that you are always a kid for me. Okay? She's become a stylish. Assembly has got started. -I am sorry. Go & stand. lf l delay in the evening, you'd go to Principal's room. Why do you come late, dad? I told you as a precaution. Go. Girija! This case is not very easy as you think. Sir! Listen to my words. That car parking is not there in needed place. There is a rule as they should build their building leaving 45 meters from state highway. That place is not proper according to building construction rule. Do you live so luxurious by refusing bribe money, then? Sir! See the buildings in Kozhikode hill side, when K.P.K Mohammad was P.W.D minister. Everything is violation building. People are holding 5 to 10 televisions in minister's house. How did minister buy this much of televisions? Television packing. He's filled lakhs of money inside that. Bribe money for permitting the violation. Such people only are brave people. See. They are waiting there. Come there & say okay. Say okay. -Ha]I ! where do you take this? Some guests are there, aren't they.' To give them ...! Don't you have any other work? They are not our guests. Whoever m ay com e. You'll come with a tray. Apple and sweet. I don't get this freely in the market. Sir is a different Government officer. Giving water to our guests is not a great mistake. That's correct. They may give you a flat. Or 30 to 35 lakhs. We'd take some risk, then. You have to arrange a great amount for Dhanya's medical seat. Right? Sir! You earn bribe money by chasing & threatening ordinary people. You got that money's curse. They are giving this money happily, aren't they? I -Come! He's Vinay Kumar. -Hello! -He's Benny. -Greets, sir. We are doing our works in partnership. This is our dream project in true. You've submitted your application. Right? -Yeah. We've submitted, sir. Let the time come. We can think what to do. If we get a green signal from you, we will get confidence. We are thinking about some more protects also. Give & take is our policy. That only is my policy also. We don't want to waste your time now, sir. Okay. Let's go. Let me go with them and come immediately here. Hello. No. I'm there in a meeting here. No. I won't do that. -Greets, sir. If I had known sir's such a honorable posting, that incident would have not happened. I've repaired your office table there. I'll compensate my guilt of dashing your office jeep also. What's your name? Sukumaran Kolapulli.-Kolapulli...? -Kolapulli is my house name, sir. I need all the details including your car number. Sir! That's not my car. One of my friend's car. I don't have even a cycle as my own. Whoever's car it may be. I need its number. I want to get you 2 years of imprisonment at least. I've come to apologize to you accepting my guilt, sir. I've told you that car number as you'll be happy only if you send me to jail. My house is there in Katapanai. There was some rubber. I sold them. I've admitted my daughter in 3rd standard here. I've come here to give her a high level education. You need not tell me this much of details to file a case on you. No. I have to tell you. I've bought a plot in Kundanthotu here. I've planned to build a house there. I've given an application in town panchayat office here. Sir! If you help me... Oh! That's okay. Dad! Let me go. She's your daughter, right? -Others daughter won't call me as dad, right? Your daughter is very fair. But you are medium colour. This girl only sang wonderfully in school on that day. Right? You're the father of a good singer, then. Right? This is not the matter now. Right? No... In order to talk sweet... Sweet conversation will be there in between friends, right? I can start talking sweet to have your friendship also. Right? Tea. -Keep it there. Who asked you to bring tea now? Daughter told that a fat man has come to meet you. This man... On that day... Nothing. It's enough if you get inside. I've understood the cause for your daughter's fairness now only. Did you come to test the colour & complexion of my family members? Leave the place. I won't talk official matters in my house. Why are you standing yet, man? Blow the horn. Nobody has come out. This is that military man's house. Right? -Yes. If he is there at home, call him. A government jeep...!! They are calling you, dad. Oh no. It may be that person,then. Why are you sitting in the jeep yet, sir? Come & sit inside, sir. That new paint house might be the house, which you built without permission. My son-in-law had a bus as his own. He lost his bus & house in settling his credits. They & their 2 children are going here without hailing any other go. Is this a reply for my question? I had the permission while starting the building work, sir. Here. That permission period got over 3 years ago. Right? I didn't know that there is such a rule. Or... I would have forgotten it. That's why I didn't renew it. If we want to get a current connection in this house, you have to renew it & give me, sir. This road is going to be widen. So your house is allowed beyond 15 meters only. They decided this road extension matter only after I built this house. Right? If I renew it now, it will be against our present rule. Right? No. This order... -Here only. Hold it. Take it there. Is it so long since sir has come? -What? -Is it so long since sir has come? I don't know. I've come just now. Sir has come by this jeep. Right? -I've come by this jeep. As I drive the jeep looking straight, I won't look who is there in jeep. We've met somewhere here before. Right? Sir! You don't watch anyone. How did you see me, then? How fast you've questioned me & got a goal? You're the one, who beaten my sir on the road, when we came from Kutralam. I went to sir's house and apologized to him. When did it happen? -Your name is Girijan. Right? You're his right hand. I know that. -How it will be if you say so, sir? No other go except of breaking your house. Sir! If you expect anything else, you need not expect I'm the one, who killed many people in my 27 years military experience. More enemies are there still. Come killing everybody. I'll give you the permit at that time. Girija! Start the jeep. Have you forgotten me, sir? Kolapulli Sukumaran. Sir! My plot is near by only. Just 5 minutes... -What should I do now? Sir! Not 5 minutes. Just 2 minutes, sir. -Start the jeep, man. Jeep is not getting started. -No problem. Let me help you. Sir! Sukumaran! Don't forget me, sir. Don't forget this Kolapulli Sukumar, who pushed your jeep & helped you, sir. Don't you have honor to push his jeep? You're the image of supporting the haughty officers. Is this your house? Did you get the permit for this house, military man? Get inside. He is asking about the permission. Dad! There are more mosquitoes here. Dad! There are more mosquitoes here. Mosquito! Your grandpa is not paying this flat's rent. I'm the one, who pays Rs.7000 rent every month here. If you bite my daughter here, I'll kill you immediately. Do mosquitoes have sting, dad? -Yes, surely. Even some people also have that. You're one among them. Right, dad? Do you know how mosquitoes have come here, dad? Come. Let me show you. Did you see? There are egg's outer covering full of this. If we keep this here, mosquitoes will come. This dad doesn't know anything. You need not tell that. You took birth as I know some things. Right? What does it mean? -It means nothing. Go & study. -Dad is a fool. Boss! I've got my marriage certificate. Do you know that? How did you do it? I made the witness document ready with 2 gazetted officers seal. I've found that marriage hall's register also. We wore wig, garland & made our wedding photo ready. I've got my marriage immediately. Didn't they find this as duplicate? Boss! When I gave Rs.1500 for selling my old scooter... He only gave me this idea. Finger prints are duplicate. Officers & we are also duplicate. Living in this duplicate world is also a luck. Lord Guruvayurappan saved you. Oh no. I won't go there hereafter. Please give me that. -Do you want it? Thanks. Greets, sir. -Greets. Sir! I'm Sukumaran. Sir! Don't you know me? I pushed your jeep. I came to your house before that. I came to Kutralam before everything. Sir! Sukumaran Kolapulli. When your wife gave me sweet, you ordered me to keep it in plate. If you come regarding your house matter hereafter... I'll file a nuisance case on you. Move away, man. Sir! I have to put the basement before rainy season. Sir! If you come to my site just for 5 minutes... In pay commission report... According to staff standardization... Take it, man. These files are pending. Right? -Yes. -I got such troubles along with them. Where is your site, man? In Kundathotu side...! 18,19...Come& meet me on coming 23rd. If I have convenience, I'll come & see. -Thank you, sir. Yes. It's me. From where do you call me? I'll come now itself. I had some work in the corporation office. I got your phone while coming out from there, Meera. Aditya's number has got changed. Truly... I attended your call without knowing who is calling. I tried your number many times. I didn't call you after when I knew that your number was not in use. Do you want to take coffee? -No thanks. I hear your voice only after 6 months. Right, Meera? If I heard it already, I'd have not got this thrill. It's better late than never. Right? Our daughter is troubling me to see you. What can I do? Can I get her mom to her from my bedroom wardrobe? When we went to Kutralam, our daughter fell down on rock & got slight wound. She has cured now. Good. Nothing took place wrongly. -I too thought that only. We can't converse frankly in between this crowd. Right? We see light Sun light & pleasant breeze outside. How beautiful place is this! I'd have brought you here, Meera. I've come to know this place's beauty now only again. I feel that our separation for sometime is good. I realized my mistakes & ego because of that only. Right? I was a senseless fellow. I was very adamant. I didn't understand a wife's expectation & a mother's feelings. I went to my world pushing you to a lonely atmosphere. I've got a job. -Is it so? Where? In a call center here. -Very good. I ordered you not to go for job. It's my another guilt, which I realized. I didn't come here to analyze the right or wrong. I didn't have a confident shelter while going out on that day. I didn't have a job & money. I've got a job now. I want my daughter hereafter. Iran here happily as you called me after some months. Did you come to tell me this? When should I come to take my daughter? Meera! Don't talk to me so cruelly. I don't have any idea to argue. I only know my pain of staying apart from her for these months. Do you only have the suffer & problem, Meera? Impossible. I won't give my daughter at any cost Don't have such a temper. I want to see my daughter. In which school she is studying now? Do you want to take her from there knowing this matter? I'll complaint in police. A mother, who didn't even think about her daughter for these months...! A mother, who doesn't have conscience...! She wants to take her daughter thinking about her now. I'll come now itself. I'll be there. I was struck in a great problem. You should arrange somebody else to pick up your daughter, then. Really sorry, ma'am. Don't create such an apologizing situation hereafter at least. Nothing will go without money. -Girija! Let's go. -Sir! Sir! Today is 23rd. This jeep will make you late. That's why I've brought a car, sir. A/c car, sir. A/c, sir. Please come. Com e. Is it enough if I stand here? Let me come. -Sir! Can you eat fish & egg? -Why? -To order your lunch, sir. Where is your site in Kundanthotu? Near M.L.A Marotti Sathya Pradaban's house. Oh! I told next to Marotti Sathya Pradaban sir's house. I'm also coming with you to guide you. Right? In this same with along with me...? Is there any problem in that, sir? -Hello! What eligibility do you have to travel with such a great officer? I only brought the car. -It may be you. So... Take the car to Kundanthottu. Sir! I am -Leave the way. What should I do now? -Can you ask that question to me? Sir! My plan. -Hold your rubbish plan. How is the party? ls there any chance to object his project? You don't interfere in this case. Let me take care of it. That's okay. It means I won't get any percentage. Am I right? Stop here. Oh no. Why do you like this, man? It's 15 minutes since I started waiting here. I have 4 more site inspections. Do you know that? Sir! You've come by the car, which I brought there. I didn't get any other auto immediately. That's why... That's not my problem. Where is your plot? It's that only. Please com e. Com e. What are these things? I don't understand. Don't you understand this, sir? I have marked the basement according to my plan. Girija! Remove everything. -Okay, sir. -Oh no. Before I approve your plan... You have marked the basement. I'll blast your plot inside. I didn't expect the blasting & smoke, sir. Remove and cut it. -Come here, man. Sir! If sir asks me to remove it & cut it, I will do it. What, sir? There is a rule about coastal regulations. According to that you can build your house beyond 50 meters only from the shore. You have to build a cowshed here. Why? -To keep 2 cows here & take care of them. What's this, sir? -Leave the way. -Don't laugh. I'll tell another matter also. This plot has got notified by Green Belt. You have to chase some other plot to build a cowshed also. How did they build this much of houses there, then? That survey number doesn't come under Green Belt. Why is it so? I don't have any responsibility to tell that reason to you at present. I have to ask you this, sir. Sorry. Girija! Let's go. -Okay. You remove the balance sticks also. I bought this plot for a great price. If you buy a plot, where people can't live, it will be like this only. Mister! If you buy this plot from defense, you should leave 100 meters. If it is railways plot, you'd leave 30 meters. This is procedure. Do you know that? Sir! You please help me. -How can I help you? Sir! He is looking pity. -I didn't ask your opinion. You'd tell this always. -Girija! He says Girija let us go, always. What a kind of man he is! Are you okay? -Very good. Is this the car shed? Give me that, man. Here! Hold it, man. They are standing still. Let me remove these also. Hold it down, man. Good stick. -Hold it tightly, man. You'd have one and half meters space for a car shed from the wall. This is not even 1 meter. It means if you wash your cars, the water will fall in your neighbors kitchen. Let me tell my neighbor to build his house leaving some space, sir. This is kitchen. Petrol bunk is there nearer to your kitchen. What will be the state if any spark flies to bunk from your kitchen? Let me take care so that any spark doesn't fly there, sir. Can you catch the spark by flying, then? I can't approve this plan in away. Girija! Let's go. I don't understand anything. He's left you helpless. Sir! You've got a speed post You'd sign here. Enough, sir. This is advocate John Sebastian's house. Right? Give the phone to him . It's taken place as I expected. Meera has sent a lawyer notice to give her my daughter. That's impossible, John. I can't give her my daughter. Okay. Let me come there by tomorrow morning. What, dad? -lf l ask you a question, you'd tell the truth. Right? Whom do you like more? Is that your dad or mom? I don't like you both. You are telling that just for fun. Your dad only got you this toy. Right? Your dad only drops you in your school & combs your hair. Right? Mom also will do these works. She's not here now. That's why... right? Okay. Let me ask you a matter. If your mom comes & calls you, can you go leaving this pity dad? I want to go to toilet. Today itself I will draft for this reply? Still I've not read it fully. She didn't care about her daughter's future also while going out from my house. There's no any logic in her sudden demand. My daughter has got settled in her new school. If we change her from there suddenly, that will affect her studies. You'd highlight this letter with that point. I can do that. But trying for a compromise before taking this case to court, is good. Right? I don't have any hope, John. I know about Meera's character, don't I? She is very adamant. She'll stick on her decision. She's got a decent job also now. She might have got self confidence. If she takes my daughter also, my life will be zero. Let's hope that it won't take place. Whatever it is. I'll talk to Meera before sending your reply. Let me call you in the evening. Take your seat. I didn't see your husband here again. Did he get transferred from here? No, ma'am. He's busy in work. What's the matter, then? Ma'am ! You know about Dhanya's character. Right? If she gets any wish, she will be very adamant until she makes that true. Doing medicine is her present adamancy. Is that a craze? That's a good matter, isn't it? It may be. But if she doesn't get her seat in this year itself... Her state will become very serious. Dhanya is very intelligent & well studying girl. right? If she writes the entrance exam, she will get definitely. If she doesn't get a seat... Isn't it enough if you think about it later on? What I wanted to tell you is...! She has a great respect on you, Principal. If you advice her, she will obey that, ma'am. I don't understand. You'd tell her not to be adamant. If she doesn't get her seat in this year, no problem. If you ask her to try next year... Or... Ask her to join in any other course. Do you want to meet her? What? -3rd standard Anu's mother wants to meet you, ma'am. Ask her to come. Sorry. -No problem , ma'am. I have no any objection. Take your seat. I was not in station, when he admitted my daughter here. I've come here some days before only. I would like to see her once. What? Didn't she come today.' I don't know. We won't allow visitors in class time even if she had come. Ma'am! Don't include me in visitors group. I have to go for my duty at 11 o'clock. That's why... -What's your name? Meera. Meera! Sorry! I have to obey according to the instructions those I got. I won't allow anybody to see his daughter. I'm her mother. Pity! She's crying. Her husband only admitted her daughter in our school. I have to obey his words only. Right? Then her husband & she... -They may have some problems. Whatever it may be. He may be a cruel man. That man, who doesn't allow a pity mother to see her daughter. That will be correct, when we think from a mother's side. But... who knows about the reasons for what he decided like this? That Principal is a good lady. But... What can she do? Where do you work? In a city Call Center...! My daughter is also studying in this school only. In plus 2. Can you wait here for 5 minutes? I'll come now. I've come here at correct time. But I didn't see my daughter. Didn't you see her? Michael! Go there & search. See whether girls are talking there or not. -Okay, ma'am. Let me also go & have a look. What are these, sister? I don't have any mood to have anything. Meera! You're younger than me. Right? You got a confidence to create a situation. Shouldn't you have a guts to face that continuously? Do you know how difficultly I found my daughter's school? Didn't that cruel man tell you about her school also? I know. Although I was patient. Meera! Where do you stay now? In a women's hostel of Punjab association. I think that is Dhanya. Is this your house, sister? -Yes. Come. Mom! Do you know howl felt without seeing you, dear daughter? Why didn't you come to see me, mom? My child! Meera! Get inside with your daughter. It's a way, where many people walk. Mister! -Sir! -Did you see my daughter? -No, sir. Go! Where were you? Do you know howl felt without seeing you? Where did you go? Tell me. Dad! I've come now, haven't I? You're a child, aren't you? You can't come & go according to your wish. You can watch the TV. later on. Where did you go with whom? Tell me that first Why do you cry? Who dropped you here now? That's my friend's mummy. Have you started lying to me nowadays? Why didn't you tell me as your mom only dropped you now? Tell me, dear. Can you lie to your dad? Mom told me not to tell this to you. Did our daughter take her breakfast? -No. Call her. She told that she doesn't want to eat anything. Today only---? Or... Always...? This girl is very adamant. I was trying to tell you last night itself. Medicine entrance result has come in net. What happened? -She didn't get her seat. She is crying from that time. Where's she'!? Dhanya! This entrance exam is just a formality. You've got a good percentage in plus 2, right? All India entrance result is going to come. Even if you don't get in that also... I'll take care of that. Com e. Dad! In this academic year itself... I told that I would take care of it. Right? Come. Oh! Snake has bitten a person, who got affected by thunderbolt. When? Is he alive? Which snake, sir? Why do you spoil my peace coming to my house always? Peace of everybody, who com es to your office, is getting spoiled always, sir. It's enough if you just see this for one minute, sir. Here. I've changed the kitchen to North side. I've removed that sin & altered my plot, sir. There's no any petrol bunk up to 5 kilo meters, sir. Look, sir. I've removed the car shed. Sir. I've removed the Pooja room also. Then, refuse house also. Why do you say so, sir? Pooja is here, right? -Yes. Did you leave 50 meters from here or not? That alone is enough. Nearly... -I don't want to hear your doubting words. Sir! If you show mercy... -Who are you to me to show mercy on you? Are you my relative? I didn't get the luck of becoming your relative, sir. In that case, leave the place. I'd not see you in this area. Have you heard my words? Be ruined. Be spoiled. Tell me. What's the matter? Let that incident come to vigilance court. No. I can't do anything before that. Listen to me. This stay has got created by Government anti corruption bureau. They've sent me here making me as a chief. By their faith on me as I would act honestly. You're a Government official. If you yourself interrupt like these... It's not fair. This is called as fence graze the crops. Mr. Murthy! Please don't call me regarding this matter hereafter. 14. Here! 15. Okay. Sir! A client Vasudevan has come to meet you. Ask him to come. -Sir! Greets, sir. Sir! I will tell you my complaint with evidence. City ATP Gopi Krishnan has asked me bribe. I can't support such a great crime as I served for our country in military for 27 years. That man is torturing me for many days just for a small house alteration, sir. That's good. We are suffering from many months to trap this Gopi Krishnan. We've received 100's of complaints about him. But everything is without from address. What can we do without getting any clear evidence? When did he ask you that money? On coming 12th. We can catch that man on the spot on that day. Dy.S.P Nandha Kumar is the squad leader here. I've got a person, by whom we can trap ATP Gopi Krishnan. He is there in my cabin now. That man has asked money from this person. Only if people like you come forward to help us... lf l say truly... We will have work. Giving bribe is easy for people. They don't have awareness. Sukumaran! I'm Dy.S.P Nandha Kumaran. Kolapuli Sukumar character is our plan to trap Gopi Krishnan. You both got introduced already, then. Right? Yes, sir. Sukumaran is my friend. That was his plot. I went to meet Gopi Krishnan as Sukumaran & requested him to approve that. We can stop that drama now. Shall I take him, sir? Shall we all discuss about our further moves? Sorry, sir. -You can go. Umbrella! -Okay. Will any confusion arise? -Nothing. Let's talk inside. Inside...! Please come. You wait outside for sometime. Sir! Please enter. All the numbers of these notes are there in our record. We've applied Phenolphthalein named powder in these. This powder will get stuck in that man's hands while getting this money. We will come at that time. We will immerse his powder hand into Sodium Carbonate line. That line will turn into pink at that time. That will become our primary evidence. You hold that money little tightly while giving him. If you give little pressure... It will be easy to make the power to stuck in his hands. We will be waiting in many places in that office. Vasudevan! You'd go there at correct time. You'd give him this. You'd do that much only. You wait here. -Okay. Where do you go? -I'd like to meet ATP. What's the m after? Sir knows that. -You can't meet our sir today. Is it enough if you meet somebody else? -I don't want to meet anybody else. Go to Chennai,then. Chennai. -Military brother. Sir has gone to Chennai by yesterday evening itself. No. That is... Lord Eswara! What happened? Come carefully, man. What, sir? What happened? -Start your auto fast. Go. What happened? -I don't understand anything, sir. Go fast, man. -I'm going, sir. Dad ! Dad ! Leave the way. Please come. This is an unlucky dying pain of a person, John. Husband and wife have filed case for their own child. I've spoken many times with Meera. She is not ready for any type of compromise. There's no use in thinking hereafter. Com e. Our case may be the first case. Opponent Nandha Kumar was an irresponsible husband. He treated his wife... My client Meera as a slave. He tried to dump his wife in the kitchen & treat her as a cook. He didn't allow her to go for any job. He's an irresponsible husband. I can tell confidently as he will be an irresponsible dad too. Mr.Nandha Kumar is a 100% committed Government servant. He could not reach home at correct time many times. He thought his wife to take care of her child freely only. I don't know for which reason opponent is insisting him to give his daughter. She went out from home without thinking about her child also. She didn't even turn back & see her child for the past 6 months. How did she get affection on her child suddenly? My client didn't have any other go to take care & bring up her child on that day. It means she has got a situation to take care of her child. If her situation again becomes bad, we have to think that she won't take care of her. Opponent is a selfish lady. She is young. She may marry somebody else in future. She can get children also in that relationship. We can guess about this child's situation at that moment. Who won't get married? Can you say confidently that Mr.Nandha Kumar won't get married & have children? We have to think about child's care & safety only in this case. He doesn't drop his child in school at correct time. He doesn't pick up her at correct time also. That child is living in a great tragedy only. He took his daughter somewhere for picnic. His child fell on the rock & she got wound. We have to save her child from such an irresponsible man. I tell this only. Let's meet, then. Why.' -I told my advocate in some situation as our daughter fell on rock. I didn't think that he would tell that in court. That's not a problem. If the war gets started, our aim should be the victory alone. Other things are secondary. Meera! Do you want to com e? Let me drop you. You man! Stop there itself. You man! Not only for animals and birds. A permanent shelter is necessary for all the creatures in this world. You didn't help a person, who tried to build that. Not only that. You've spoiled him also. What do you stop me? What happened? You don't know anything, do you? You'll get punished definitely. This is a curse of a pitiable person. Just a second. Sir! Do you participate in tournaments? Are you a member in this club? If you are not a member, think about it. Good club & good court. You are not a member now, aren't you? Who brought you here, man? Nobody brought me here, sir. I've come myself. Go out. Get out. I've changed my plan. -Don't you understand m y words? It's not an office, mister. We are friends. My mood has gone. You people play it. Who's that, Gopi? -An interrupting person. Sir! Let me tell you a truth. I have a great problem, sir. Problem less people are not there anywhere. I don't want anything to drink now. Sir! This plan is 45 meters beyond from the shore now. I've forgotten to tell you a matter. I've shown some lakhs in plot to get saved from capital gain tax. I know that it is a crime. Although if you have any need, you can use it, sir. If you don't have any need, you can return it. That money is not necessity for me. I've told it thinking that it may be useful to you. Who's that? Girijan! How did you get my number? We've taken that from your application that you submitted in our office. I have to tell you an important matter. Where do you stay? Let me come there. -I've stayed in distance now. Tell me the matter over phone. That matter should not be told over phone. That's why I told that I would come there. Finding my place is very tough. That's not a problem. It's enough if you tell me your area. I'll come there. Let's do one thing. I'll come to my site. Yes. There only. Dad! I'm ready. You just wait for 5 minutes. It's emergency. -If it becomes late, they will make me to stand outside, dad. If they make my daughter to stand outside, I'll beat them. If they beat you, dad... He won't be alive, then. You're a lucky person, Sukumaran! How did you convince him? Did you admire our sir? Sir told me in the morning. That Sukumaran is a honest & intelligent man. We have to help him. I've got stunned truly. Is it so? I can't believe it. What should I do hereafter? Sir is a person, who didn't get bribe from anyone until now. You told that you got some amount in your hand. Right? Sir doesn't need that amount freely. He told that he'd use that money now & return it back. I don't have any problem even if he doesn't return that to me. Oh no. Sir is very honest in that matter. You'd not be without getting his money, when he return it to you. Not only that. Sir asked you to come to his house afternoon. Did he take my whole plan, then? He's taken everything. Sir used to approve close people's plans with seal in his house only. Shall I go? You've taken the goal, haven't you? Okay. Okay. Dad! You've applied more powder on your face. What happened? Is it more? Dear! I'm trying for a seat in Chennai's Shanmuganandha medical college. You'll get it by next week. Thanks, dad. Can I tell everybody boldly hereafter? To whom you want to tell? Principal asked me to go to school. Shall I tell this to my teachers? Tell them. How can you go to school? Girijan uncle told me as he would drop me in school. Is he there outside? -Yes. Let me get down & send back your jeep, dad. Mom! Let me go. Good morning, sir. -Welcome. Is it not late, sir? -No. Com e. Let's sit inside. -I'll come. Take your seat. You pushed me in the road on that day. That pain was there in me for these days. That's why I treated you badly. That's not a problem. You've shown grace on me at least now. Right, sir? I only troubled you, sir. But I will become a friend today, whom you can never forget, sir. I didn't bring my house plan. There are some corrections in that. You can alter it to any level. I won't even inspect it. Isn't it enough if I approve it blindly? This is... Brother! Please receive it. Give me. Arrest Kolapulli Sukumar. What's this? I don't understand. Getting bribe is alone not a crime. Giving bribe is also a crime. Arrest him. Everybody knows that here, mister. Each & everything knows that matter. I've given complaint in police against Dy.S.P, who tries to arrest a honest officer. That's why they arrest you. Words you told have become meaningful. I'll become a person, whom you can never forget from today. In kids games police will arrest thieves in different costumes. Mr.Nandha Kumar. I only called them. If a matter takes place, everybody should know that. Right? Move away. Please. Dy.S.P Nandha Kumar got arrested while trying to trap ATP officer in corruption case. The incident took place in Gandhi nagar ATP officer's house. Local police only arrested Dy.S.P Nandha Kumar. Come immediately. They show your hubby in television. Why? -Come & see. They tell that they arrested him. -Arrest...? Dy.S.P tried to trap a honest officer & he got trapped himself now. ...We knew this only now. Over to our reporter Arun Shukla's report from corporation office. To talk about this matter to us... ATP Gopi Krishnan is there with us to tell about Dy.S.P. Let's hear his words. Sir! I'm an honest Government officer. I can't be involved in any crime against the law & order. He told that I asked bribe. I hate the word bribe itself. I asked him to bring bribe & taught him a lesson through police. Society thinks that all the Government officers are getting bribe. This incident will be useful to change that opinion. How much'! -Rs.?.0. Mom! Anu's dad didn't come to school today. She got hidden, when I came out from Principal's room. She told me, when I asked her. If she stands in front of Principal's room Her dad will come there. She will meet our Principal & complaint about her. So she was hidden. Why didn't he come to take his daughter? Who knows that? Dear! Come here. Sit here. We can find any solution. Okay? Do you know what happened here after when you went out? What, mom? Dad made a person to get caught by police, who came to trap your dad. Our house was full of media people & police. A great commotion took place. They are showing that now also in 'l'.V. Look. That thief came to our house for many times like an innocent man. You've seen him, haven't you? We knew this much only now. Dear! Why do you cry.' He is my dad. Dear! You don't worry. I'll call the police & tell them now itself. As they should release your dad immediately & Anu is waiting here. Your dad will come now. Don't cry. You stay with her. Is that Punjab association Women's hostel? Can you give the phone to Meera, who is staying there? Meera! I'm Raja Lakshmi sister. Yes. It's that person only. I too have seen the T.V. Is that your hubby, sister? How did my daughter come there? Okay. Let me come there immediately. Sir is a tricky person. He's caught the cock waiting cunningly. Will anybody think that humble person as a vigilance officer? Sir! How did you come to know that matter already? Whatever it is. You've trapped a very great person. Sir! You'd accept it. It will be a lesson to other officers also, who try to catch us. Whatever it is. Gopi sir is the star now. Tell as in this century, man. My daughter asked the reason of the excess powder on my face. She doesn't know that my beautiful face is going to come in TV. right? Sorry for the interruption. Let's meet later on. -Giriia! Let's go. I wanted to tell you that I'm going to go with them. Only 2 pegs. 3... 5... Did you see me in all the channels? Who is this child? -Police arrested her dad only from here. But... How did this child come here? Mom! Dear! His wife. Anu also is studying in Dhanya's school only. We got introduced in that way only. There are misunderstandings in between us. That is the primary cause for our separation. I know very well that Nandhu would have not done any crime. But... How did this incident take place? I've planned to go to Delhi. I have postponed that program to tomorrow. In true... I planned to break that Dy.S.P's hands & legs though my goondas. But Gopi Krishnan's this plan is very nice. Is Kerala there under this Dy.S.P's control? We've created many buildings in Green Belt with many great officers consent than him. We've got many flats approval against the rule also. What is his loss because of these matters? Dy.S.P Saravanan was there before him. He was a very good person. What did I do him? I renovated his house. I'd have got only Rs.50000 at that time. -That amount only. I used to give him 1% in my profits. He didn't even come to our office for raid after that. That pig didn't know about Gopi Krishnan's power. That's why he got arrested. My garbage plant is there in Puttandharai. Right? That health officer told many health reasons objected that protect. This Gopi Krishnan told him. As I am the deciding authority. You go & mind your job...! That man did his duty. I built my plant also. I'll be there with such people always. -That's how K.N.C has become K.N.C. I've forgotten to tell a matter. Minister Thangappan called me as soon as this news came in T.V. He told me to tell his thanks to Gopi Krishnan. I told him at that time. Thangappan brother! Nandha Kumar may get the bail in future. This case also may get postponed. But his shadow also should not fall in vigilance department. Thangappan brother has promised me as he would do that. That's the correct treatment for him. Okay. Why didn't you people give me a drink? Oh! We've forgotten that by our excitement of seeing K.N.C. I'll get you now. Shall I go? Did you take your breakfast? Do you want some juice, biscuit or anything like that? If you have any inconvenience, you can tell me that too. I will help you. Shall I tell what you may think now? Why did you try to trap me? Right? I only should answer for it. Have you seen worms after killing a rat? I've come to enjoy that feeling and situation. Let me advice you also. You vigilance officers should stop using this Phinaphthalene & Sodium Carbonate. That's an old concept. You can arrest silly thieves only by that concept. In the beginning of last year... Another officer tried to arrest me with the same concept. I got money wearing glouse in my hands. I threw the money & glouse somewhere in the next minute before his move. They went off with disappointment. I went to my home with money after sometime. Consequence. He lost his money & he didn't even get succeeded in his attempt. In a ruling, where the government has gone to thieves hands... A government employee shouldn't try for this level. Defeating you people is not my aim. But I understood later on...! Destroying me completely is your idea. About my excess properties. I'm a binomi of somebody else. I know that you people are watching me keenly. I also wanted to keep you in jail. You can't even stamp vigilance office steps hereafter. You may think that you are very clever. But cleverness alone is not enough to face somebody. You should have wisdom also. You don't have that. Shall I leave? -Please wait, sir. No need of more days. I'll destroy you completely one day. It's just a dream . -No. It's an incident, which is going to take place. If you think about the rule alone, is it enough, lawyer? Is there no any value for poor people's tears? He's destroyed my house worth 1 and half lakhs, which I saved difficultly. That man told about the road extension. It's a clear cut lie. But we can't give evidence of his words only. Right? It was a building without permission. That's why he destroyed that. This only is therein notice. Then... How did you tell... Court doesn't understand about a person's true feelings sometimes. Lord Eswara! -Okay. Let's meet on 14th as I told. Lawyer! Nothing else. I'll get my pension by next 5th only. I'll pay your fees at that time. -That's not a problem. Let's meet later on, then. -Okay. Take your seat. Sir! This is S.P's letter. I want to trace the numbers from which ATP Gopi Krishnan received calls recently. Wait for 2 minutes. Is there Sunny? -He's there in lawn, sir. Why did you come here, sir? I wanted to see you in lock up. You've got bail, haven't you, sir? I want to talk something to you. -Just a minute. Meera has filed a case in court as I'd give her my daughter. Sir! you've told me that already, haven't you? What's the position of your case now, sir? Let that be in any position. I involved over in my profession. That's Meera's complaint. It means I loved my profession more than my family. But I can't bear this matter ever. -What happened, sir? You don't know anything, do you? Rascal! You're a criminal, who betrayed a person the one, who believed you. I don't have any idea to talk with you here. S.P. Abraham sir is waiting for you. Come there. If you talk to roughly as you're a higher official... Who told you like this? Didn't you inform about vigilance movements to Gopi Krishnan often? My God! From where did you get this information? -Shut up, scoundrel. I have all the information about your mobile's calls. Come with me. Where? I'm not a dog to come behind you obeying your order. Get up, man. All the people have watched the arrest of this person in many channels. Her child is there a great tragedy now. Not only that. Other children will tease her saying her as an accuser's daughter. This is her state in the place, where she stays. My client got arrested while trapping an accused, who got bribe. My client got released by his higher officials orders... Stamping him as an accused is the greatest guilt. I'm talking about my client's daughter's sentimental problems. No any channel or paper has revealed about Mr. Nandha Kumar's release. That's why her daughter's problems are getting continued. That's why I request the court to order him to give his daughter to my client soon. I'm K.N.C here. How is Koniac? No...? Shit. You've spoiled my mood. I'm coming to this resort driving from a long distance is for relaxation only. What? I won't take whisky and all. If you have any Indian brandy, you send me that. Is that Gopi? Come. Didn't they com e? -They've taken some other cottage. I've stayed here in order to get relaxed lonely. Good matter. In which cottage are they? Cottage number 20. Gopi! Come. Take your seat. Money transportation is risky. So we've brought the gold coins of worth 35 lakhs exactly. Get that. If you sell your coins & change it as money while paying medical seat capital fees. Enough? That's not a problem.-Then go. Come here after finishing your job. Let's enjoy here together. Please come, sir. Greets ! Did K.N.C tell you the matters? -He's told me. It's good as you people involved him also in your project He will be a great support to all of you. We can do many protects united hereafter. -Surely. Benny! Get us that bag. There are 272 coins according to today's rate. Do you want to count it? -Hey! No need. In that case, accept this valuable box, sir. Let your project get succeeded. My wishes for that. -Thank you, sir. You should co-operate with us. Gold coins. Right? Enough. We can file a case on you for having an excess wealth. You tried to send me out from vigilance believing talkative words. But department had a great confidence on me. I promised them at that time. As I will be peaceful only if I send you to jail...! I told that I'd destroy you completely. Do you remember that? You teased me at that time. What do you say now, Gopi Krishnan sir? If a person is smart, I'll appreciate him even if he is my enemy. A dedicated person only can trace out our such a secret dealing. I'm very glad in getting defeated in front of you, Mr. Nandha Kumar. Accept it. What's that? -I'm okay. Sir! Vigilance! Giriia! Let's go. Where is that man? -Who's that, sir? I asked about Gopi Krishnan, who was there in this jeep. I also have come in search of Gopi Krishnan sir only. It's 2 or 3 days since I had seen him. Why did you drive your jeep in such a great speed, then? Look it, sir. It's showing a speed limit up to 140. But I never had gone beyond 110, sir. Is that an over speed, sir? He asks about Gopi Krishnan. What happened? -What will happen? A great problem has got solved very easily. Sir! Get inside. If I don't get her flowers daily, my wife will fight with me. Excuse me. Raji! Get me a Horlicks in a pure glass. I'm very tired. My body has become lean after many days. Sir! Do you want to have Horlicks? Don't you want it? If you want to take rest, you can relax inside. I'm going to lay down inside. You didn't even call me, did you? Did you forget that today is the judgment day? I didn't forget it, John. I feel that my time is very bad now. If my fate is there against me, I don't have an ability to hear that. I can't lose my daughter, John. How will it be if you become childish like this, Nandhan? I'm waiting here. Come immediately. While considering about all the aspects in front of the court in this case... When we think about that child's care & safety are important... This court gives judgment as child's dad Nandha Kumar... ...should give his child to his wife Meera. Where should I bring our daughter? I'll call you. Child! Change your dress. I've asked you to change your dress. -Let this program get over, dad. It'll become late, then. -Today is a holiday. Right? Why should I change my dress, then? We have to go out. -Let's go after 10 minutes, dad. If I tell, won't you listen to me? Come here. -Leave me, dad. Did you take birth to trouble me? Move inside. -I won't come. I want to watch T.V. I won't com e, dad. I want to watch TV. -Listen to me. Here. Dad! I won't com e. Where are we going, dad? You don't question me. Come. I could not tell anything to my daughter. It's enough if you tell her everything, Meera. These are daughter's dresses, toys & books. If I have these, I will worry a lot thinking my daughter throughout my lifetime. Com e, dear. Isn't my dad coming? -Your mother is your father, mother & everybody hereafter. Mom! Do you know? We are going by flight tomorrow to Chennai. Is it so? But your dad didn't tell me anything. Dad told me not to tell you this now as he wants to give you a surprise in airport. But I could not hide this secret until then. Is it enough if I wear saree while traveling through the flight? Not enough. You have to wear jeans minimum. Hey! How can I get jeans now? I'll get defeated in front of my mom. We have our flight at 110' clock in the morning. We'd reach the airport before 10 o' clock at least. Girijan uncle will come here in Jeep in time. We have to pack everything now itself. I'm going to pack my things. Oh God! Did police arrest Gopi sir? Don't you people know this person, then? No, sir. He is not belong to this area. I didn't call you without disturbing you in the morning itself. A person is dead here, sir. Suicide. I think he has consumed poison. We've got a small bottle. We can't identify that person. Move! All of you move. Sir! Do you know this person? Sir! Do you know this person? No.l don't know him. It's enough if you both sit there. Let me come finishing the check in. Com e. Dad! Do you want anything to drink? -No need. -Mom! For you? Let me come having a cool drink. Today is not good totally, Raji. What happened? lam also watching you. You don't have any excitement. Do you feel seeing that expired person by today morning? It may be. I'm getting afraid thinking about him. Will our matter get succeeded or not! Everything will take place well, dear. You have to identify your bag. Please come. I'll be back now. Which is your bag in these? -This is my bag, sir. Okay. Open it. I've identified my bag. Right? Why do you ask me to open it? We are enforcement officers. We want to check your bag. Where did my dad go? How many lakhs are there in this? -35. For my daughter's medicine admission. That's not a problem. You can go telling this matter to our senior. Get inside. Sorry, Mr.Gopi. We tried to trap you, when you agree in contact in this airport obeying the rules here. That's why, we called enforcement officers. You could not run and get saved as it is a heavy bag. Right? Your intelligence & wisdom didn't work out here. Right? Pity! Do you remember my these words? That only took place here. Like the story of an old king, who won trying again & again after many failures too. We can trap any intelligent person also if his time is bad. Each & everybody, who is involved in corruption, should analyze themselves. As we have a bad mindset or not...! Gopi Krishnan! You didn't think about that. That's why you've got caught as your time is bad. Gopi dear! -They've announced the boarding, dad. We didn't think about you. You need to postpone your Chennai journey to some other day. It's good if you go home now. For our daughter's admission...! It's an important matter more than that. We have to take Mr. Gopi Krishnan. What happened? Why do you take him with you? Don't worry. Let me tell you a matter. Valmiki monk was a criminal. But his family was not ready to share his sins. That has affected that monk very much. His mind got changed. He did penance, became a great sage & wrote Ramayanam. I don't ask your hubby to write Ramayana. But a wife & children only should correct a person, who gets bribe. You both didn't do that. Court only will decide his fate hereafter. Com e. Let's go. Com e. Oh mom! Mom! Accused Gopi Krishnan is the one, who is fully involved in corruption. We'd not find the birth place of 35 lakhs, which we seized from him. An ATP officer can't save a huge amount of 35 lakhs... ...from his salary in such a short period. We've seized only 35. It means he might have earned more than that. He might have bought many properties on his wife & daughter's name. That's why we need to take the accused to many places for enquiry. We need to question him. That's why we request you to leave the accused in the vigilance custody for 4 days. Bag, which they seized from the airport is not my client's bag. How can be that 35 lakhs be my client's money, then? Vigilance department Dy.S.P. Nandha Kumar... ...only created this case on my client for his revenge. My client made Dy.S.P to get arrested in a bribe giving case here before. This man is keep on threatening my client from that onwards. If we let my client under that cruel Dy.S.P's custody... ...I suspect that my client will come in present state. Not only that. My client is a heart patient also. So... I request this honorable court not to leave my client in vigilance custody at any cost. Defendants argument as it is not accuser's bag is a great lie. Vigilance was keep on watching the accuser's family until they reach the airport. They've noted his bag before when they got into the jeep itself. Not only that. Accused has agreed that bag as his own bag to enforcement officers. He tells him as a heart patient, then. Public says that this man doesn't have any heart. I leave the accused under vigilance officers custody for 24 hours from today 3 o' clock. Do you believe that... ...you can destroy the corruption in corporation by arresting Gopi Krishnan? It's a warning for other officers, who are involved in corruption. Many days thief will get trapped in net one day. We are glad by arresting this criminal, who were torturing people from many days. Kerala without any corruption. That's our dream. We calculate him as a beginning step of our project Allow us to go now. We have to enquire him hot. Move away. Which hospital? Mr. Gopi Krishnan. Please come with me. Come! I got a call while getting started from the court. We can face these mishappenings only if we understand the reality of our life. I know that advising others is very easy. When the advising people get any mishappening in their personal life... They will get broken also. Let that doesn't happen in your case, Gopi Krishnan. Your daughter has taken suicide attempt. She's in a critical stage in l.C.U here. Sister! Sir! Gopi dear! Our daughter...! Ramesh! You call the advocate. It's ringing, K.N.C. What a job did you do, man? I told you not to leave him in their custody at any cost, didn't I? Gopi Krishnan is involved in our association dealings. Do you know that? If vigilance officers enquire him , who knows that he won't tell anything? We have got 100's of problems. Which is secret or not...! If that comes out, do you know what will take place? What do you know? You've left him. Go & eat well, fool. We have to do something immediately, K.N.C. We should do. We have to do. The problem has gone beyond our hands. We've got a limited time only to question you. How it will be if you cry like this? My only daughter is struggling in between death & life. Kill me also now. You worry a lot as it is your own daughter suffers, don't you? Military man has committed suicide. There's a value for his family's tears also, mister. Enjoying by harming a person, is not a good character. You need only peace now. Okay. We will come in the morning. Come. That man has got broken, Mahesh. Although, sir! He had tormented us well! Right? Somebody is fearing about the truths, which are going to come out from you. You may know about them. They might be your close friends until you got trapped under our custody. You should not be alive. They want this only now. This will be the price of relationship with them, who save wealth in an illegal way. I'm working in vigilance anti corruption bureau from the past 12 years. We'd not catch this accused on that day, ...who got 35 lakhs worth gold coins from Samorin builders. Accused ran off & got saved. When we got the information as the accused... ...go to Chennai changing the coins as currency... We went to airport informing to our seniors. We took this accused in custody, who got caught by enforcement. We've seen 35 lakhs in his bag. They are telling that gold coins got changed as 35 lakhs. Why did they delay to produce these material objects in the court? This is my question. They got sometime to count those currencies & submit. They got to note those numbers also. -No. They got to create those evidences exactly. It's just an imagination of defendant, sir. From which bag did you seize his money? From a pale pink colour bag. Can you identify the bag if you see that again? I can identify that. Produce the M.O. Is this his bag? -Yes. Show the M.O. What's that? Sir! This is a bar soap. I'm telling from the beginning as they filed this case to revenge my client. Enforcement officers seized these soap bars only in the airport. It's an united plan to spoil the honor of a prestigious Government officer. That's why he misused the Government officers. Sol request this honorable judge to file a case against Dy.S.P, ...who is the cause for this plan. Do you want to tell anything? They've changed it. It's like a hoodwinking art of changing 35 lakhs as soaps. It won't take place in any other place except India. This incident implies the cruelty of criminals, who earn violating the law. Finding such criminals as soon as possible, who cheat our judicial trial... I can only produce them in front of the honorable judge now. I knew these matters. I also prayed for her. It'll be good if you come with me just for 5 minutes. Please. I'll be back soon. It's our office. Please get down for a minute. Our chief S.P.Vinod Abraham sir wants to meet you, Mr. Gopi Krishnan. I don't say that violation & corruption only... ...will win according to your reply in our enquiry. But we can bring the criminals in front of the society totally. Some amount of black money will come out. It'll give peace in people's heart, who feel that our country has got corrupted fully. Let that at least happen. I have a practical opinion. I can bring at least one person in a good way. If we both get united, we can do many good things. That's why we've changed the evidence in the court discussing a lot together. Please come. An assistance town planning officer's statement has brought out many crimes. 'Vigilance & anti corruption bureau have raided in many places at the same time. They break & alter 55 buildings partially or fully... ...those got built violating rules in our corporation. Officers have found many black money & binomi properties. Honest vigilance Dy.S.P has got a great appreciation by our Government. Dad ! I could not manage this child. She is crying always in order to see her dad. Let me leave, then. If she cries to see her mom hereafter... Mom! Why didn't you sing after when I gave you a song? Oh Moon! “My didn't you look at me after when I blossom ed like a lilly flower? Oh Breeze! I can't express you my love in a word. -My wish won't get satisfied by only look. Sing again, you moon! Why didn't you sing after when I gave you a song? Oh Moon! “My didn't you look at me after when I blossom ed like a lilly flower? Oh Breeze! I've forgotten my words without having capability to tell my wish. My inner golden dreams are coming out. I've got admired in that. Two thoughts, which have joined in the story. Showering pleasureful feelings...! Unknowingly... Why don't you take care of me secretly, breeze? Why didn't you sing after when I gave you a song? Oh Moon! “My didn't you look at me after when I blossom ed like a lilly flower? Oh Breeze! I can't express you my love in a word. -My wish won't get satisfied by only look. Sing again, you moon! Why didn't you sing after when I gave you a song? Oh Moon! “My didn't you look at me after when I blossom ed like a lilly flower? Oh Breeze!
