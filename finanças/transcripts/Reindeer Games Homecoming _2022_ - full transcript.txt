Are you ready to get your Reindeer Games on?! Keep it together, man. I don't think I can do this. - Five! - You have to do this. - Four. - Do I though? - Three! - It's now or never, Chase. - What's it gonna be? - Two! Alright, is there a trick to this madness? One! Just turn your brain off and jump. Hey! Ready for the games, Mac? Oh, I was born ready! Hey, make sure you have the EMTs standing by, Kyle. We don't want to relive the mishap of '07. You ever gonna let me live that down? Oh, not a chance. I absolutely told you I was going home for Christmas this year, remember? You said you were flying your family to you in Lake Como. Different client, Teri. It's me Chase, the one with the pregnant sister who needs help this year. Oh. My bad. That's cray cray. You totally sounded like George. You still haven't answered my question. What do we need to do to push the needle on this project? You gotta give me a chance, Teri. I'm perfect for this movie. You know it and I know it. All we gotta do is convince the director and the studio as well. Come to think of it, I'm not sure that the writer had you in mind either. Well, let's just try to make them see the light, okay? You got it, killer. I'll call you when I land. Please, don't. Hey, guys! - Hey! - Hey, Mac! Make us proud this weekend! Always! Miss you, Pop. Take the plunge. Dive. I own you Wednesday crossword. Yes, I do. So... Oh, yup. 24 across is "serendipitous." - Ow! - No helping! That is a nonsense rule that you just made up. Crosswords are supposed to be fun. I find it very fun to finish my crosswords by myself, Simon. You're such a 32 across. Square. Mm. Well, at least I'm not a 17 down. Oh, I don't have that one yet. No? Hm. I'm sure you'll figure it out. So, how are you doing? I'm good. I'm fine. I'm gonna do my thing with the Boys tomorrow. So, speaking of the Boys. Mm-hm. Should we be focusing more on our brains or our brawn? Do not pump me for information. What? Me? I take my Emcee position very seriously, - thank you very much. - I know, I know. You will learn about the events a the theme for the Reindeer Games this weekend at the opening ceremonies like everybody else. Mm-hm. Not that you need my help. You ever gonna let someone else take the Kris Kringle Cup? Never! I knew that. Hey! Okay. Nothing yet? It's been five hours. Take a breath, brother. Sorry, I'm just... I will call you when I hear something. Focus on the good stuff. You've gotta great thing going with your current franchise. Convention crowd is eating you up. You gotta get me that movie, Teri. I just cannot be the Deathly Panic guy forever. Oh yes, baby! Wait! Wh-What happened? Did the email come in. Did I get it? No, that was something el... That was, um... That was for another client. Don't you say it. It was for Brad. Look. Patience, brother. Freaking Brad. Is that Chase Weston? Did he see you? Glad that's in there. One round left to go. Who will be the Science of Christmas Trivia champions? Will it be the Genome Gyroscopes? Or the Mitochondrial Mesmers? Can I get a drumroll please? Genome Gyroscopes, you're up. Okay. We're going to take Marine Life for 1500. Bold move, Jeremy. And the answer is the reason aquatic animals don't freeze solid during the winter. What is blubber? Blubber helps to insulate aquatic mammals like seals and whales in freezing conditions, but what about the animals that only live under water? They would freeze solid if it weren't for this fact... Because ice floats! Nice one, Kit! And the Mesmers have just tied the game! You know what this means. Students: Lightning round! That's right! It is lightning round time! Know the answer, yell it out! Okay, and go! The Arctic Tundra! Sucrose! The tilt of the earth's axis in relation to the sun! Because... The speed of light! Hexagonal rings! Tryptophan! Coal! And the Genome Gyroscopes are the champions! Yes! Alright, guys. Have a great Christmas break! I hope to see all of you at the Reindeer Games. I know I'm going to see you guys. See ya. Bye, Ms. G. Oh, GGs for the W! Uncle Chase! What's up, Jeremy? Hey, buddy. Oh, you guys. Uh, hold on a second. Pre-med? Is that you? It's me, Chase. Ah, yes, yes. I am aware. So, the legend is true. Harrison High's golden boy has returned home for the holidays. Yeah, well, I, you know, missed too many Christmases with these guys and I came to help my sister while my mom's away. Cool. God, how long has it been? It's been a minute. I'm gonna go get something from my locker. Yeah, okay. I'll see you outside. See ya, Jer. Bye, Ms. G. You just look so great. Oh. The last time I saw you, you were... I mean you had, like, the... Yeah, the braces, and the glasses, and a love-hate relationship with Proactive? That's not what I meant. Relax. I'm over it. Mostly. It's not like there's a constant reminder of my unfortunate youth displayed in a public shrine that I walk by every day of my life. Oh, wait. Thank you for that. It's really good to see you. Yeah, you too. If it isn't the Pirate King himself! Simon Augustus Cook! I mean, it's so good to see you. Oh, wow. Wow. Wow, hi. Wait, what are you two doing here? Oh, well, I teach English and Drama, you know, obvi. Someone had to carry on the legacy of the Huskies Theater program after you left us - for fame and fortune. - Fair. My husband and I loved Deathly Panic by the way. Chad actually camped out for tickets to number six. - He's a little obsessed. - A little bit. Yeah. Uh, wow. That's awesome. Thank you. What about you? Are you here inspiring the youth of today to follow you in the medical field? Actually, I work here too. Oh, what about the... I teach AP Bio and Chemistry, and my students are so inspiring. Your nephew is actually one of my best. Yeah. Speaking of which, I should probably get him home. I would love to catch up properly in the next few days. Are you guys going to the Reindeer Games this weekend? Are we going to the Reindeer Games? Um, yes. What? - Five time champion! - He's the Emcee, so. - Right there. - Yeah. Okay. I got it. We'll be there. - Okay. - Yeah. Uh, so I guess I'll see you there. Simon. Pre-med. Oh, my god. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mac. Mac! Chase Weston remembered my middle name. He is still so nice, and he called you by your old nickname. "See you later, Pre-med." Yeah, I hate that nickname. You used to like it. And you used to love him. He doesn't do it for me anymore. Super mega action star Chase Weston does it for everybody. Plus you actually have history with that Adonis, so I do not accept that statement. I'm sorry, history? He kissed me one time in a convention center at the science fair in Poughkeepsie and then proceeded to totally Danny Zuko me, so... He dressed you in leather and permed you hair? Can we please stop talking about Chase Weston? Are you kidding me? All I wanna do is talk about Chase Weston. This is the most exciting thing that's happened to me in years. To you? Yes! To me. I am old and I am married and I have been asking to live vicariously through your love life forever and you have never delivered. This might be my only chance. Oh, my God. Oh. Alright, a couple of minutes. Watch it. Oh, yeah. Yeah? Okay. Man: One more? Yeah. Straight Poker, one draw. You're going to hate me forever for this. Hey, boys. Sweetheart! Hiya, Mac! Ricky. Hi. How ya doin', kiddo? Ah, you know, it feels different every year, but it's never any lighter. I know what you mean. Come on, let's do this thing. Yeah, let's do it. Everybody ready? Mm-hm. We miss ya like crazy, Charlie. You were tough as nails, and funnier than most. And one good lookin' son-of-a-gun. We dedicate this year's Reindeer Games to your memory. Merry Christmas, Pop. Merry Christmas. Gotta be honest. I think he'd be mad we keep wasting good scotch. It's tradition. I'm just saying. It's good scotch. Mm. I know, what're ya gonna do with this guy? Come on, let's play some cards. I'm not sure I trust you to deal, Ricky. You calling me a cheater? I mean, if the boot fits. Get outta here. - Come on. - Alright. Let's go. I'm so happy that Santa's on his way Been waiting all year long For Christmas Day I feel alive when I look up to the sky We're gonna go find Jasper. Okay. Hey. Good luck, buddy. Chase. Yeah? Chase? Yeah, Serena. What's up? What's going on? You've been buried in that thing since you got here. I'm on the short list for a movie, so I'm just checking emails and texts and other stuff. Hoping that this project will put me back on the map. It's just been a few years since I've done a big movie, and freaking Brad keeps booking my gigs. "So jazzed to be working with this Academy Award-winning genius." That's a stretch. "Hashtag blessed, Hashtag grateful. Prayer emoji, prayer emoji." God, I hate that guy. Okay, so when you said that you were checking emails and texts and stuff, what you were really doing was stalking your rival on social media. Now, does that make you feel good or not so good? I'm gonna take that as a "not so good." Hey, Mac! Morning, Serena. Hey! Oh, my goodness. Look at this belly! Any day now. Oh, Lord, I'm ready, but my due date's not 'til after Christmas. Well, must be nice to have your brother in town to help out. Chase is a god-send. With Michael deployed and my mom needing to help Nanna in Florida, I don't know what I'd do without him. Yeah, happy to help. You getting deja-vu? Wanna try your luck and join a team? Ha! No. Thank you very much. But I will enjoy watching you all freeze to death though. When did the Reindeer Games become such a production? When Simon took over. Right. Say no more. Ho-ho-ho! And there he is. Ah! Merry Christmas to everybody! Hey! Hey, boys! How's our competition look? - Like nothing we can't destroy. - Yeah. Wait, this is your team? Hey! Welcome to the 37th Annual Harrison Falls Reindeer Games! Hoo-whee. So, this year we are playing to benefit the Harrison Falls Hospital children's ward. And now... Are you ready to get your Reindeer Games on? Now, as is our custom, we will open the games with The Polar Bear Plunge! Six brave teams have registered for the Games. How many will be left after the Plunge? Only one way to find out. Jingle Jangles and Donner Dads, you're up first. Come on up. Let the games begin! Yeah, let's see what you got! And three. Two. One. Plunge! Ooh. I'm feeling physical pain just watching them. Don't tell me Hollywood's made you soft, Chase Weston. - Jasper's out. - What? He ate way too much caramel corn last night. He's puking everywhere. We need three to compete. What do we do? Up next, Santa's Sisters and the Mistletoe Misfits. Come on down! If you can find a replacement, you can still play. Who's gonna join our team last minute? One. Plunge! Three, two, one... Uncle Chase? Hilarious. No. Come on. It'll just be like that thing you did, The Arctic Fox. Come on, man. You know that was a stunt double. You know I hate the cold. Come on, Chase. I know for a fact you did this exact plunge your senior year. Yeah, and then I got pneumonia and I couldn't finish my final performance of Oklahoma. Randy McLeod had to step in, and that kid can't even hit a high G. Blitzen Boys, Kringle Kids. Let's go! Oh, hang on one sec! We might have a teammate replacement maybe. - Jerry: Come on! - I'm sorry, Jer. I might have a big movie coming up. I can't risk getting sick. I'm so sorry, honey. I know how much this means to you. And if your father were here, he'd be in there with you in a heartbeat. It appears we have our first forfeit of the game. The Kringle Kids have failed to produce their third teammate. No, they haven't! I'll do it! Yes! Oh, wow, and, well, just like that they are... I can't believe you talked me into this, sis. Thanks to a last minute save by Harrison Paul's very own super star, Chase Weston. Is he taking... Oh, wow. Okay, Hollywood. Let's go. Yeah! Come on, Uncle Chase. Let's go! Here, hold that. Come on, we got this! Woo! Yeah! Hey, buddy. Keep it together, man. I don't think I can do this. - Five. - You have to do this. - Four! - Do I though? Three. It's now or never, Chase. What's it going to be? Two. Is there a trick to this madness? One. Just turn your brain off and jump. Right. Plunge! Where you going, Hollywood? Yeah! Let's go! I hate you! Come on, who's next? Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Here you go, you're welcome. Hi! Okay. Okay. Here, take a swig of this. It's 10:00am. I'm good. No, you're not. You're two shakes from hypothermic. You're clearly freezing. I am toasty. I'm warm. I'm fine. That's your toasty look? No, it's good. You should go into acting. That's hilarious. Just take a swig. It'll warm you right up. Doctor's orders. Wait, so you are a doctor? Technically yes, but paramedic now. Volunteer paramedic. Whatever, just drink the booze, man. Fine. Geez. So pushy. No fraternizing with the enemy. Or sharing our booze with them. Oh, he needed it way more than we do, Saul. Come on, an action star like yourself? You'd think you'd be used to extreme situations. Well... You know who's a great action star? Oh, please don't say Brad. Clint Eastwood. - Yeah. - Do you know Clint Eastwood? I mean, I don't... I mean, I know who he is, but I haven't... He doesn't want to talk about Clint Eastwood. Well, why wouldn't he wanna talk about Clint Eastwood? Everybody loves Clint Eastwood. I love Clint Eastwood. I am holding in my hand six envelopes. Each contains a list of the three games that will be played this coming week, culminating in our Annual Christmas Eve Dance right here at the Fire Station, where the Kris Kringle Cup will be awarded to the last team standing. Your judges to my left will award points for creativity, skill, wit, and will. And now for the theme. The 37th Annual Harrison Falls Reindeer Games theme is... The beloved novel, A Christmas Carol. You will be given points for incorporating this theme into each of the events. So, use these next few days of prep very wisely. Alright, teams. Begin! Alright. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Uncle Chase! Let's go brainstorm! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Uh, okay. Okay. I'm keeping this. Let's go. Okay. Look... Uh, guys, are we allowed to be in here? Perks of being the wood shop manager. Oh, okay, Jeremy and I, we'll head to the shop, and Chase, you hit the drama department for wardrobe. On it. Cool. Yes. Mm... Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hey, Teri. It's, uh... It's me again. Just checking in. You don't have to call me back, but if you want to, you know. I'm just... I'm just... I'm really hoping for some good news after a long, frustrating season. Anyway, I'm rambling. Ah, take care. And Merry Christmas. Oh! I'm still here. Yup. You good? Yeah, I'm great. What's up? I'm sorry. Your face is really good. Mm-hm. Well, I mean, you kinda just manifested out of nowhere. I'm very scary. I mean, you're terrifying. We done now? I don't know. I'm still thinking. Well, it looks like you and I had the same idea so let's, uh, back it up there, shorty. Okay. Um... Did you leave some for the rest of us? Oh, Simon is obsessed with Victorian England, I promise there's plenty to go around. Well, this is an interesting choice. I thought the theme was A Christmas Carol, not Mars Attacks. Am I missing something? You'll just have to wait and see. Hm. Hm. Can I? - You what? - I just have to... - What? - I'm gonna go. 'Cause, uh... 'Cause, uh... - Oh, my bad. It's my bad. - Yeah. 'Cause you're... Sorry. - Excuse me. Sorry. - Yup. Yup. Bye! Hold on a second, um... Could you just help me? For old time's sake. 'Cause you clearly are an expert at this, and I have zero idea what I'm doing. Mm-hm. What? No, it's just, this feels very familiar. Oh, come on. You charming me into doing all the work on our lab reports and then high-fiving when we got an A. That's just... All I heard was you think I'm charming. Oh, my gosh. I don't want to let Jeremy down. Okay, you know, fine. I will give you this one thing, and then that's it. No more help from me. So, just think about the themes weaved through the story of A Christmas Carol. Generosity, community, redemption, transformational growth. Just pick a theme and go with it. Doesn't matter what you wear as long as it's connected to the theme. - Hey, stop! - Ow! Do your own work. Yes, ma'am. Copy that. Transformational growth? Uh, one more thing. Don't be afraid to, you know, think outside the box, make a fool of yourself. What's the point if it isn't fun, right? Huh. Um... Ooh, what's this? 2015 Weston blockbuster. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Chase Weston. Holy... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Human Dog Sled Derby! Maybe the chains were a bad idea. Yes. Now, our judges are currently awarding points for creativity and wit, but points are meaningless if you don't get across the finish line quickly, because the bottom two teams will be... Eliminated. Christmas Future? Yup. I see what you did there. Thought I told you to think outside the box. Well, I got the making a fool of myself part down, so. Alright, teams, mount up! Oh, and God bless you, every one. Ready. Set. Go! Go! Pick up the pace! They're gaining on us! Faster! They're gaining on us! Oh! Go! Go! Go! Go! Let's go, let's go! We got this! Go! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Go, go, go! Yeah! Yes! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Trouble in paradise? Thank you. No. It's annoying, I'm stuck. We talking life or career? Well, I was talking about Tuesday's crossword, but now that you mention it. You do crosswords now? Yeah, thanks to you, I've been addicted since high school. I'm still terrible, though. I can barely get through Monday's without help. Well, I can help you. I'm sorry, don't you have a rule against that? I don't accept help from others, but I'm happy to give it, you know, I mean, if you need it. I'm sure you are. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I get a pic with you? Hi. Yeah, sure. Awesome. Can you? Oh? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Thanks. There we go. Good. - Thanks, bro. - Thanks, man. I am so sorry about that. It's totally, totally fine. Not weird at all. What were we talking about? Hi, I saw you taking pictures and my daughter would kill me if I didn't get one, so. - Oh, Yeah. - You don't mind, Mac, do you? Oh, no. I don't. I don't mind at all. Ready? Here we go. Oh, you wanna look in this direction, though? Oh, oh. There we go. This is super fun. Nice. Thank you. Thank you, Chase. Ah, you're very welcome. Uh, there's a bunch of people behind me right now. Mm-hm. Uh, Chase. Don't you have that meeting? - The... With the director? - You know what? I do. - I do have that call. - Sorry, you guys. - He has a meeting. - Oh, I'm sorry, guys. I gotta go. I think we'll be safe up here. Oh. I do not see that couple happening. He is not good for her. What? You just pulled me into the high school make-out spot. What? No. Oh! No. That was... That was not my intention. I... It... It's dark and quiet and away from people. Yeah. Exactly. Are you trying to take advantage of me, Pre-med? You... You know what? Shut up! You're welcome, by the way. I'm sorry. Thank you for rescuing me. Yeah, I didn't exactly frequent this spot, or spots like this in high school. So, you know, honest mistake. Well, I did frequent this particular spot, quite a few times. Yeah, with which cheerleaders? By myself actually, thank you very much. Came up here to get away from the noise. Sort stuff out when I felt stuck. I put a lot of pressure on myself back then. Still do. It can't be easy living in a fishbowl like you do. Is it always like that, with the fans, I mean? Yeah, sometimes. But, you know, I don't mind that part so much. It's more the pressure to be more, do more, stay relevant. Whether I'm actually enjoying any of it or not. That sounds exhausting. I mean, do you enjoy it? Do you love it when you're doing it? Well, yeah. Of course. I mean, I'm living the dream, right? Right. I'm sorry, I... No. Don't be sorry. I asked 'cause I'm interested. I remember this about you. What? How easy it is to talk to you. You know what you need? What do I need? In my experience, the best way to get out of your head is to go do something for someone else. So, you're coming with me. Where are we going? Alright, there you go. I got one for you, Saul. Macaroni and Chase. Classic combo. No? Okay. So, you got the treats? Mm-hm. Great, and Meera is meeting us here? - Yeah. Just texted her. - Okay. Hollywood, glad you could join us! Hope you warmed up your pipes. Haven't caroled in a while, but I promise I will do my best, Sir. Well we need all the help we can get to drown out Ricky. What I don't have in talent I make up for in volume. - Wow. - It's a motto to live by. - Mac! - Hey, Meera! - You guys ready for us? - Absolutely. We've been waiting for this all week! I can't tell you how much it means to us that the Games are benefiting the hospital this year. Well, you were an easy sell. Alright. - Alright. - Let's go. I'll take that. Saul: Start here, and then Ricky, you're up here. I'll catch up. You go up here. We should switch, so I would be here. You want me to hit the high notes? Um, no, I think we'll be... Sorry to interrupt. Are you okay? Yeah, I was just lighting a candle for my dad. I'm so sorry, Mac. It's not your fault. That looks like it's seen better days. Oh, yeah. It's from Pop. Is it one of your Christmas Eve letters? Yeah. How did you know? Well, you guys would write a letter to each other every year and exchange it on Christmas Eve, right? Yeah, I just can't believe you remember that. Well, I remember a lot of stuff from back then. He wrote this one to me a couple days before he died. Looks like it's still sealed. Yeah, I haven't read it yet. I keep trying to. I carry it around with me everywhere, just waiting for the right moment or something. Well, he was such an amazing person. You must really miss him. There you guys are. Everybody is waiting. Come on! Alright. Okay. Christmas Eve, the lights are glowing In the hallway and in my dreams Somewhere in my heart it's snowing In the place that still believes Silent night, the stars are shining Ice is forming in the dark We stay warm beneath the covers Winter wonder in our hearts Frozen whisper, I still hear you Singing sweetly of our love Tender songs will keep me near you Underneath the moon above Hey, Ruthie, guess who's coming by the warehouse today. Your friend Mary from school, and her mommy. Murphy: Wow! Mary's such a good elf, Dad. She made two PB Can I have grape jelly, please? I love this movie. This is great. You know, I've always wanted to work with this director? What's going on with you? Did you get the part or something? What? No. I haven't heard. I actually haven't checked my phone in hours. Then something's definitely going on with you. I'm great actually. I just went caroling. With Mac? You did Mac's caroling thing? Yeah. It was... It was nice. Say more. There's not much more to say. Ooh, hey! Nachos! Hey, make your own! Ow! But these are amazing, and they're right here in front of me. Really? I can't have a nacho? Stop deflecting and talk to me. I wanna know what's going on with you. Nothing! I feel better today than I have in a very long time, and I think it has something to do with this place and the people here. Any specific people? Mm. Fine. Mac is... You know, she's... She's Mac. She's a breath of fresh air and it was nice to see her again. Have I shared enough? Are you happy now? Can I please just have a nacho? Thank you. Mm-hm. Here you go. Enjoy. Would you like some butter on this one? Don't do that. We only have one cube, so we have to do this properly. - Okay. - Okay? What? Oh, hey. You on fuel duty too? Oh, yeah. I don't need a pick. Just give me a smaller chisel right here. Okay, okay. Don't get your panties in a bunch. Ricky's blood sugar is low again. Tell him to take a break. We don't have to present the sculptures till tomorrow. I dunno, they want this win as bad as I do. I don't think that's humanly possible. Hey, um, take a break with me. With you? Yeah. I just need help with one little thing. I thought we talked about this. No, no, no. This is different. I don't need your direct help. I just need your access to the atrium. What does an atrium have to do with ice sculpting? Well, if I told you that, it'd be cheating. Okay. Whatever. Be my guest. - Mm. - Go. Turn around. - What? - No spying. It's my... It's my classroom! I'm done. Geez! Hey, do you know there's this new thing called the internet, where you can, like, look up any pictures of any atrium in the entire world? - What? - Yes! Oh, that's so amazing, except none of those would be our atrium. You know, it still smells like AP Bio in here. Formaldehyde and overachievement? Oh. Look, Pre-med. We used to sit right over here. It was actually over here, and I don't like that nickname. Well, you used to call me Fancy Pants. The fanciest of all the pants. At least yours was a compliment. You were younger and smarter and at least a foot shorter than everyone in class. Late bloomer, but... Kind of like Doogie Howser. Except way cuter. So... What did happen with you becoming a doctor? It was literally all you could talk about back then. I, um... I was actually finishing up my residency when my dad died, and when he did, I... I just fell apart. I could barely function, let alone take care of anyone else. He left me the house, so I left my residency in Boston, and moved home and then just eventually started teaching and volunteering. Wait, you're gonna go back, right? Yeah, I want to, I plan to, it just hasn't really felt like the right time yet. Plus, I... you know, I've got responsibilities here now, and I still get to do what I love with the people that I love. It's a good life. And it's enough. How do you do it? Do what? Know that you could have so much more, but you're content with what you've got. I wish I could do that. Yeah, I think... I think big grief puts a lot of things in perspective. I know I'd be totally lost without my community, that's for sure. And look, I mean, I'm not totally content with my work. I miss my residency every day. But my life is really full because I know that I matter to a few good people who know me and love me well. And that's the good stuff. I mean, it's the best stuff. And that's all you really need. Look, I know I've said this before, but you're just really... Smart. Oh. Oh, it's Jeremy. Oh? Hey, Jer. What's up? Oh, hi. Mom's water just broke. Oh! Okay, I'm on my way, and I am bringing help. Yeah, come on. Come on, Mom. You got this. Okay. Oh, my god! This hurts. I forgot how much this hurts. I can't believe Michael's not here. How am I supposed to do this without him? I got you, sis. I'm here. Look at me. Okay, Chase, I got this. - You got it? - Uh-huh. No! Stay with me! Oh, my God! Uh, Jeremy. Yeah? How are your driving skills? I have my learner's permit. Everybody okay back there? Eyes on the road, Jer. Hands on the wheel, ten and two! How far apart are your contractions? They keep coming faster. Like, every minute or two. Oh, boy. Yeah, you are close. I'm just gonna take your pulse now, okay? Are we gonna make it to the hospital? We better make it to the hospital. I refuse to birth my daughter in a lame rental car! Hey, hey, hey. Serena, grab my hand. Just like that. You got it. Oh, my... Yup! That was a big one. Well done. Well done. Um, okay, Jeremy, we're gonna need to pick up the pace. Baby's heart rate's a little elevated, so. What? What about her heart rate? It's gonna be okay. You are doing great, Serena. Baby just wants out and we need to keep her snug a little while longer, so I need you to breathe, okay? - Breathe. - Big breaths in. In. That's it. Yes. Outta the way! Baby coming through! Did you just run a red light, Jer? Yeah, but I did it safely, Mom. I looked both ways. Oh, buddy, you're doing such a good job. No, he's not! Serena... I want to push! All: Don't push! Dude! Dude, come on! Hey, uh, we need some help here! - Mac? - Meera! Thank God! We're having a baby right now! Call I and D. Tell them we're on our way. Okay, gently, gently. There we go. Okay, I'm still here. Contractions are one minute apart. Baby's BP's slightly elevated. She is crowning and ready to push. Okay, got it. Thanks. Serena. Dr. Gupta here is the best of the best, she's gonna take great care of you. Okay? Okay. I'm just gonna need my hand back now, though. Okay. She did it! Healthy baby girl. Happy mama. Proud brother. You wanna meet her? Yeah, yeah! Um, yeah. Okay. Oh, my goodness. I'm naming her Holly. It's perfect. She's perfect. The most beautiful Christmas gift in the world. Do you want to hold her? Oh, hey, baby. Hello. Oh, my goodness. I don't know what we would have done without you. Thank you so much for everything, Mac. Yeah, that was crazy. You're like a real life superhero, Ms. G. No, your mom's the real superhero here, and you weren't so bad behind the wheel either. It's Dad! Here you go. Thank you. I don't want to impose on family time. I'm just gonna head home. Well, hang on, I'll drive you. Okay. Just give me one second. Chase. Yeah? Mac is amazing. Just don't be an idiot. Not again. You were incredible back there. So were you. No, but you, you were calm and focused and in control. I am telling you, Mac, you have to go back to your residency. You cannot deprive the world of these gifts any longer. Yeah, I remember this about you. What? Just the way you make me feel. Like I can literally do anything. You literally can do anything. Look, I only speak the truth. When you are in the presence greatness you have to acknowledge it. And I'm standing here... in the presence of greatness. What are you doing to me, Chase? I have wanted to do that again for a very long time. I'm glad you did. - I missed you, Mac. - I really missed you. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! I'm coming. It's a Christmas Miracle! Tell me everything. Go. How could you possibly... We have been neighbors since we were five. I have watched every awkward doorstep scene you've ever had. You think I was gonna miss 2012's MTV movie award winner for best screen kiss when he rolled up here? Please. Now spill the tea! I... I... I don't know what happened. I'm just... I'm still waking up. Well, maybe this will jog your memory. Now, give me the deets. And honestly, can I just say, I'm kind of offended that you didn't text me, like, right away. Oh, my God. You're glowing. Oh, my God. You're actually glowing. This is nuts. This is nuts. What am I thinking? Mac, don't you dare. No, he's, like, he's on another planet. This is fantasy land. What is the future here? Stop, stop, stop. You always do this! You always come up with some excuse for why it won't work out for you, right when it is working out for you. No, I don't. There was Johnny the finance guy who was "too distant." Yeah, well... There was Rhett the realtor who was "too clingy." Oh, and let's not forget Marco, who had literally nothing wrong with him. I did not respond to his love language. Who doesn't respond to gifts?! Mac, what if this is it? What if everything that has happened has brought you and Chase back together? You're glowing again. Good gentlepeople! Our judges have reached their decision. After a a tremendous showing of frozen frivolity, icy insight, - and cold hard creativity... - I got this. Don't worry. The Kringle Kids have jumped from 4th position to second position to advance to the final round. That's what I'm talking about! Yeah! That's right the Kringle Kids and the Blitzen Boys will face-off tomorrow at the Harrison Falls Hockey Bowl for some good old fashioned holiday ball hockey! Looks like you're still in the game, fancy pants. Well, I don't wanna brag, but it was my idea. Hey, we wouldn't have won if it wasn't for Kit. Very true. Ice Pick Picasso over here totally crushed it. Thank you. Oh, I'm going to go grab my bit box. I'll come. Your idea, huh? What? The "transformational growth" of Ebenezer Scrooge as represented by a transforming butterfly? It's so weird. Where'd you get that idea? Yeah. It's just great, right? You know what? I'm gonna treat you to a consolation cocoa. Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm feeling more like a you got lucky latte. Hm. Everything is better here. Christmas. The town. The people. Even this hot chocolate tastes better. What's in this stuff? I don't know what they put in yours. Ooh! Oh! I may never go back to LA. Okay, right. I mean, I don't really need to be there anymore. Everything works remotely nowadays... Wait, you're not serious. Well, I don't know. I'm just so happy, Mac. I mean, I feel like I can actually breathe again. You are. You are serious. I mean, there's this movie I've been waiting to hear about that would take me to Prague for a few months. Oh, wow. Okay. I've been obsessed with it, actually, about getting it, but now I'm not even sure I want the gig anymore, which sounds insane to say. So, you don't want the movie now? I just kinda wanna be with you. I'm crazy about you, Mac. Whoa. Whoa? Those are some pretty big declarations, Chase. Well, I have some big feelings, Mac. Last night was perfect. Wasn't it? Um, of course it was. I... Just so we're clear though, are we talking, like, "Science fair in Poughkeepsie" perfect? 'Cause I'm just trying to manage expectations here. What's going on, Mac? You just have this history of getting swept up in the moment and shining your very bright light on people and then, you know, moving on when the moment ends and leaving bodies in your wake. I don't think that that's fair. Really? Come on. I was everything to you on that science fair trip and then we got home and I wasn't anymore. I was back to Pre-med, your quirky little lab partner. Look, it's fine. It's fine, I promise. We were young, we didn't know any better, but I'm... I'm just telling you right now that I cannot do that again. I'm sorry I hurt you. The truth is... I liked you a lot back then. I was scared. I didn't know what to do with those feelings. So, I was dumb and I ran, and... I've always regretted that. You sure it had nothing to do with the fact that I was me and you were you and when we got back to school we didn't really fit? 'Cause I'm still me... and this amazing little holiday bubble we're in right now will eventually burst. This isn't your real life, Chase. Maybe I want it to be. All I know is I just want to be around you. So... please... give me a chance to redeem myself. Please. Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Come on. Cins of Harrison Falls, Citizens of Harrison Falls, it is time for holiday ball hockey! One, two, three! - Pre-med. - Fancy Pants. - It's on. - You're mine. Ah, come on! There you go! Yes! Go, go, go, go! Whoo! Yeah! Get it! Get it! Dancing the night away Let's go! Whoo! Oh, yeah! Simon: Can you believe it, folks? A tie game after the third period! You know what that means, sudden death overtime! That's right! Whoever scores first brings home the Kris Kringle Cup! All right, guys, change of plan. It is sorry to say that I am not in ball hockey shape. So, I'm gonna take the net. That's a good idea. Me and Kit will tire them out and I'll look for a weakness in their defense. I don't know how much longer I can keep up with these kids. You're just sitting in the net. We're the ones chasing them! Okay, they got youth on their side, but we got experience, right? So, no need to get too aggressive. We just play our game... Tough D, we fill the lanes, wait for them to make a mistake. Yeah? You got it, kiddo. - Kringle on three? - Chief on three? All: One, two, three... - Chief! - Kringle! Ooh! Good job, guys. What? This is amazing. It's like The Mighty Ducks meets Grumpy Old Men. This is so inspirational. We gotta develop this. Teri... what is happening? I'm just spitballing. What are you doing here? That's a very good question. What in the world would make me leave my beautiful family on the day before Christmas Eve and fly all the way to God-knows-wheresville, Indiana or where ever this place is? Wait. Wait. Did I get the part? Heck yeah, you did! Bring it in, brother! Hoo-hoo! That... that's... Wow, that's... that's... That's great. You don't seem excited. Why aren't you excited? No, no. I am, I am. I just... - you know... - Okay, okay. Wait till you hear the deal. Okay? - Okay. - Three picture deal, back-end participaish, and an up front fee that puts you in the big leagues. Yeah, I told Brad, and he was pumped... and he was a little bit jealous. Oh. Uh... I-I just can't believe you're here. Genius move by the way. Playing that small-town hero stuff? The Gram is, like, going off with videos of you connecting with the normals. I mean, caroling at the hospital? Who are you? George Bailey? Keep it up, though; it's totally working for you. All that heat, that's probably what tipped the scales with the studio. Oh. Terri, thank you so much. Um, but I gotta go. Okay. Just don't go falling for the local librarian, all right? Hah! - Later! - Later. - Big League! - Thank you. See ya. Peanuts! We're officially into overtime, folks. Mac Graves clearly done playing games. She is ready to end this thing once and for all. Very aggressive move by the five-time champion. Mac! Right away, Mac Graves is on the attack! I'm open! Oh! Goal! It's all over, folks! Mac Graves with the game-winning Goal! And the Blitzen Boys bring home the cup... once again. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you okay? Hey, your head. I'm, uh... I'm... Okay. All right, look at me. Look at me. - It's just my wrist. - I'm fine. I'm fine. I just feel a little lightheaded. Follow my finger. Follow my finger. You got it? Oh, that's not so bad. No! Chase! Saul? Saul? Saul? What's going on? - No, I'm okay. I'm okay. - You're okay? All right, well, let me check, let me check. This one? Saul: Yeah. - All right, hang on. - Okay. Okay. Oh! Ow. Okay. Yeah, We need to get them both checked out. - Help me get them to my car. - Yeah. Come on, old-timer. - Chase? - Yeah. Yeah. Slowly, slowly. You good? - I'm fine. Okay? - Yeah? Mac... - Yeah. - I'm fine. Oh! Possible hairline wrist fracture on Saul here. Don't make a fuss. My legs still work. And this one has a head lac. Guys, I really don't need a wheelchair. - I'm fine. - Any nausea or emesis? No, but he did loose consciousness for a few seconds. That's only because I stood up too fast. Pupils are equal and reactive, but he'll most likely need some stitches. Let's get them checked out. Thanks, Mac, we'll take it from here. Yeah. Oh. Oh. I come in peace. Don't throw a candle at me. I'm unarmed. Are you okay? I'm fine. My head's been through worse. CI... I can't even begin to express how sorry and mortified I am. Come on, it was an accident. I mean, I hope it was an accident. It was an accident, right? Yeah, obviously. I'm not a monster. I just was mad. I... Yeah. Yeah, I got that. At me? No. No. I... yes. Not... And... I think I'm more just mad at myself. You and I were both supposed to have these epic lives, and you've had the guts to go out and do it, and I'm just... I don't even... I don't even know. Well, at least you won the Reindeer Games again. Congrats, champ. I don't care about the games. You sure? 'Cause the four stitches on the side of my head tell a very different story. I do this. I do this every year, thinking that, somehow, if I just win the games, I'll... I'll... feel closer to Pop or something, and then, I'll have Christmas with my family again, and then I'll finally be ready to move on, to get back to my life. And every year I win, and it never... It just... It just leaves me feeling more stuck. I'm stuck, Chase, living in his house, playing this game he loved, with his friends, just desperately trying to keep him alive, when he isn't. He isn't alive. You still can't open it? If I do... If I do, that's it, I'll never hear from him again. I'll have to let him go, and I don't want to let him go. I miss him so much. Look... I don't know what your dad said in that letter, but whatever it was, he's waited a really long time for you to hear it. Maybe it's time for you to listen. I... I-I can't open it. Chief Graves: "My dearest Mac, "I'm so proud of you, I could burst. "Ask the boys; "they can't get me to shut up about my daughter, the doctor!" "You've got a big brain. Everyone knows that about you. "But what's gonna make you truly great "is your heart, and my girl, "you've got one of the biggest ones out there. "I'm so lucky that I got to be your Pop." "Don't forget... "the reason you heal people is to help them live, "not to just keep them breathing. "So, don't forget to keep living yourself. "Work hard and play harder. "Take chances and make a mistake or two. "You've got one wild and precious life, "so laugh hard, "and love big, "and dive in. "I love ya to the moon and back, kiddo, "always have, always will. "Merry Christmas. Pop." So? I know what I need to do. Oh, yeah? Thank you, Chase. You're... welcome. I... I want you to have the best time on your movie. It was so good to see you. Wait. Wait. What just happened? This isn't... goodbye. I'm the... local librarian you're not supposed to fall for. Mac, no that was Terri just... being Teri. - I don't feel that way. - No. You don't now. But come on, Chase, she's not wrong. No, Mac. Don't do this. Don't shut this down before we even try. I loved our little holiday bubble. It was magic. But now, I gotta return to reality. Plus, you got your thing in Prague, and... and I'm about to go after mine. So, I think its best if we just leave it. We'll always have Poughkeepsie. Okay. How's your head? Jeremy just filled me in. And so did the internet. She looks mad. What did you do to make her so mad? It's a long, sad story, but it's... Over. No, it's not. Oh, I assure you, it is. Come here. Ow! Serena! I'm injured! I told you not to be an idiot! Seriously? Okay, little brother, I gave birth, like, two minutes ago, and I need a nap, so I'm gonna make this real quick. Over the past few days, I've watched you light up from the inside out. I've watched you put your phone down and truly connect again. And I'm pretty sure we both know who's responsible for that. I have made my feelings for Mac very clear, but she does not want me. Oh, yes, she does. She absolutely does. She just doesn't think you would ever actually choose her, which is stupid because she's amazing and you should so lucky. And if you hurt her, you will have to reckon with me, Chase Weston. And that is not a thing you're gonna wanna have to do. And congratulations on the baby, Serena. I have been meaning to come by. She is so cute. Does anyone else want to weigh in on the situation? He's right... about her wanting you, and about the other part, also, except that you're gonna have me to deal with, as well. I may be old, but I can still throw my weight around in a scrap. He's my ride. And I was eavesdropping. Great. Is that everyone? I'm with them, Uncle Chase. Phenomenal. So, what are you gonna do about it? Well, I think I'm gonna need some help. The holly and the ivy When they are both full grown Of all the trees there in the wood The holly bears the crown. The rising of the sun And the running of the deer, The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir Sweet singing of the choir Hey. Why aren't you getting dressed? What do you mean? The award ceremony isn't till later. Okay, let's go. What? Simon! What? Uh, Simon, what are you... What are you doing? Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh... Ugh. Why don't you have anything cute? Excuse me? I swear to god, this is my one failure as your best friend. Ugh. So much flannel. Okay, what is happening right now? Oh! This could work. Oh, these heels are nice. Simon, stop being weird. I need you to do something for me and it's not negotiable. Okay? I need you to put on this dress, and these heels, and put on a little makeup, and do your hair, and be ready for the boys to pick you up at 6:30. Why does it matter what I wear? Do not question me right now! It's Christmas Eve, and you are the Kringle Cup Champion, and I want you to look cute! Is that too much to ask? No? Good. Well then, my work here is done. This dress, those heels, hair, makeup. 6:30 sharp! What? "Reindeer Games Bonus Round for Mac. "Follow the Clues." One down... "Einstein, Darwin, Hawking to name a few." "Genius". Six down.

Chase... No, no, no. You told me you would give me a chance to redeem my... I'm sorry. Um... Were you... Were you saying something? Yeah. I had a whole speech prepared, and now my brain's a little foggy for some reason. I'm sorry. There was a scavenger hunt and a speech? I'm pretty good at stuff, too. I love you. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Well, I'm glad we're finally on the same page. Okay. How do we gonna do this? You in Prague, me in Boston, maybe? Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa Time-out. Your residency? Well, I reached out.

Come and claim this Kris Kringle Cup! Merry Christmas, Fancy Pants. Merry Christmas, Pre-med. Technically, I actually finished med school a while ago, so you're gonna have to think up a new nickname.
