You should stay in the water longer. Took you the whole morning to read 28 pages? Bad eyes. So early? Early? You'll be graduating from university soon. Alright, wait till I get my pay check. I'll get you a pair of glasses. So that you won't be so uneasy. Please don't, let it be. Give your eyes a rest. Look at the view. Look. Since Mom is not here... My students taught me a new phrase. What phrase? "Pork chop". "Pork chop" is out, Dad. Don't say it, others will laugh at you. Look at that boat. How much would it cost? Around $300,000 to $400,000. All my classmates have boats like that one. They're a drag. Yes. Dad. You fought with Mom again? No. Fights are normal. Your Mom doesn't fight. I'd rather spend the time on that brat. He failed all 6 subjects in his exam. You never expected him to get into university. What else can he do if he doesn't study? Work. He doesn't know a thing. What can he do? Yue didn't go to university either. Isn't he quite happy now? Yue is not my son. If you treat him as your student maybe you'll worry less? 1587 A.D. Hmm... Do you think someone will write about a father and a son chatting at the beach? No one will read it. You never know. A story about a housewife or a fishmonger may have historical value. 2001... July 29, Sunday. This is my Dad. Whenever someone says we're alike, he'll say "I don't want him to be like me." He seldom tells stories. When we were young, he used to read us Chinese poetry. But today, he suddenly starts to tell a story. Who is Wu? Wu works for the King of Chai. He is a minister. Does Wu have something to do with Mencius? Wu is a friend of Mencius and he is his "squealer". That is, his informer in Chai. Mencius was well-prepared before he met the King. "The King, seated aloft... beheld a man passing by with an ox." So the King went to worship at the temple. He sat there. He could sit any way he liked. Like this... Or I guess, like this. He saw a man with an ox walking by. "The King beheld" means the King saw. "King asked: To where the ox goes?" Notice there are two "chi"s in the passage. The first "chi"... is a pronoun, representing everything the King saw. And the second "chi"... is a verb. A verb meaning "go". The sentence means "Where is the ox going?". "In reply: For consecrating the bell." What does "consecrating" mean? It's what you see in the news nowadays when politicians paint the eyes of dragons at opening ceremonies. They used to use chicken blood. Now they use red paint. In the old days, whenever a new bell was made people would kill a cow and drip its blood on the bell. This ceremony consecrates the bell. "King said: Let it go." See the word "tze"? It means give up. He said... Let go of the cow. Why did he want to let the cow go? "I cannot bear its tremors." What does "tremor" mean? It means trembling. Cows tremble too. When we see gangsters we tremble. "Love and respect the elderly. Protect the children. Do this and the world is yours. Book of Poetry says: Be kind to widows... and extend it to your brothers, fief and kingdom. A King extends his kindness to others. Thus, one will be able to protect the world. If not, one cannot even protect one's wife. Ancient sages surpassed others because they extend their kindness to others. So how can you be kind to animals and not to your own people? By weighing, you know its weight. By measuring, you know its length. It is so with all things. Please measure your own heart." That's it. We've finished the most boring chapter of the term. I know. Preaching is boring. That's why priests do standup comedy now. I saw it. Not funny at all. Not funny? You should have told me! I bought the tape. Any new recommendations? Sure! "Gold Finger of the 22nd Century". It's porno! In this weather with your figure, watching this kind of tape will make your nose bleed. Mr Lam is sore! Lozenges, anyone? Here, Mr Lam, gum. Thank you. Our next class will be a lot more interesting. Really. Luxun He's out! What, out? You have no taste. Luxun is very modern. He was one of the first Chinese to study and shop in Tokyo. He was living in Kanda. Just ten stops from Shibuya. He speaks fluent Japanese. You guys only know konnichiwa and arigato. Anyways. It's sayonara now. Thank you. Goodbye class. Goodbye Mr Lam. Bye. The fish is overcooked. - Really? - No good. Sorry. And you said you didn't add anything into the soup? - Yes... - Bullshit! I'm so sorry... Tell the chef. I will. How about complimentary dessert and a fruit platter? - That sounds more like it. - Please wait. All telecom salesmen are cheats! A thousand-dollar phone... comes down to a few hundred dollars in less than 2 months You can't make a living out of selling cell phones. Business is tough. Trust this guy. - What model are you using? - This one. - Look. - A "shaver"? I thought it was an antique! You think so? I think a "shaver" suits you most. Why? One day, I bumped into this guy with dyed blonde hair, red tinted glasses and shiny plastic pants. Really scary! You sure it was him? What's so strange about it? Our Yue is always that cool! Are you jealous of my hair? Bald, if you can drive a golden convertible why can't I dye my hair blonde? Right. get him! Hey guys, it's 10 pm already. I need to go to school tomorrow. Alright, let's get back to business. The school board only has $5,000,000. We hope to raise $4,000,000 more from some of our prestigious classmates. We're only rebuilding a swimming pool. Why do we need 10 million? We're talking about a pool fit for the Olympics. - Not just a pool for kids. - So? Wait, we've to talk about the library too. That's easy. Just get someone to order some Playboys. And give everyone a break. Will you stop bullshitting? This is a very important project. Our old school is being attacked. Hey, if no one talks about it... how can it claim to be an elite school? Right, we're going to show those folks... the grand style of an elite school. The fund-raising letter has to be bilingual. English will do. No. One language is not grand enough. We need two. Anyways, we've decided. Oxford boy, you will take care of... ...the English. And Lam will do the Chinese. I'm not good at writing publicity stuff. What did you say? Come on. Lam. You were our Chinese scholar. Sorry GUYS- I've to go back to the Dow Jones and Nasdaq. I give you my full support in any of your decisions. I've taken care of the bill. Please enjoy yourselves. - Let's pitch in. - No need. It's Nasdaq's treat. No. Let's share. How much? Let him treat. It's only once in a while. Am I that poor? You can afford to pitch in but maybe Yue can't afford it. I'll gladly pay for him. Maybe he wants his treat and not yours. It's their own business if they're rich. Do you think they're just showing off in front of you? You've to take care of Yue's feelings. You think he really wanted to go? He went so that you wouldn't be the worst there. What's "the worst"? Everyone leads his own life. Is being a teacher so shabby? Cho begs me to tutor his son! How old is Cho's son? Grade 4 in International school. Send one of your colleagues then. You think I shouldn't take the job? Cho is very generous. Are you that poor? Rocky? No one called Rocky here? It's for me. Dad. He doesn't like others calling him Stone! Some of his friends even call him Stove. Kids are really bad at composition nowadays. No one can write up to 400 words. Look. What crap! "Chung Yueng Vignettes" What is "Chung Yueng"? Hiking, flowers, incense and graveyards. "Chung Yueng" is a celebration of the dead. Quiet skeletons stretch their bones beneath the soil. "Who is disturbing our dreams?" What is a "Vignette"? Memories, impressions, knowledge and imagination. "Vignette" is a word of the dead. No breath, no pulse. Long frozen and buried in a dictionary. On this the day of "Chung Yueng"... The dead comes back to life. I'm giving you back your compositions. Mr Chong Ms Cheng... The exhibition will start on Friday All of the staff together with the science students must be there. Who is going to present the flowers? Form 5A Beauty Chan. Okay. There will be a seminar on the following Saturday. The guest speaker will be a professor from Fudan university. Teachers should encourage students to attend. Provide them with sample questions so that they'll have something to ask after the talk. Remember when the Literature Nobel Prize winner was in HK... one student made headlines. Since the school board wants to focus on science studies as a way to reach our long term objective of elevating the school from Band 3 to Band 2... we need to complement the effort by improving teaching standards etc. However, publicity gestures are essential as well. Principal Leung, phone call. Thanks. Is the class over? You wish! Looking for me? Didn't you want to chat? Yes, I didn't know you were still in school. Only for you. You're welcome. Come on, have a seat. Your acting skill in class is pathetic. Experienced actors like us... aren't really acting anymore. Why did you give me 60 for my composition? The reason I asked you to come... 60 is the worst! You can give me 40 or even zero. That... Don't lecture people all the time. But you guys are always lecturing me! Are you talking back? You're driving me nuts! My wife is waiting for me at home. Would you please let me go? Dinner this early? Old people... Need time to digest. Why did you get married so early? Do you have a son in university? None of your business! Is your son cute? I have two...take your pick. I can make you a copy if you like. I gave you 60 for your composition because you weren't answering the question. But it was quite creative and interesting. If you don't mind writing it one more time... Of course I mind. I never visit my ancestors' graves. I have nothing to write! Oh, I see. Can you use your imagination to make up a story? I'm not an editor and you're not a reporter. It doesn't hurt to try. Why don't you use your imagination to come up with better composition topics. Alright, what if you don't like every question in next year's General Exam? How can you know? You aren't setting the questions! Can't you knock first? What? Can't you concentrate on your homework? You're the one who is distracting me. Wow! What kind of music is that? They're all swearing! That's why I'm using a headphone, man. It's time for your public exam! So what? You need to revise a little. The earlier I start, the sooner I forget. If you start revising early you won't have to worry when the time comes. That'll bore me stiff. - Son. - What? Do you like Ricky Martin? You think I am a Filipino maid? Dictionary ls Ang back? He just called saying he will be back soon. Go to sleep. He's no longer a kid. That's true. He's always been a good boy. What now? Turn off the lights. Let's sleep. Ms Chiu and Mr Yip went to see the principal for quite a long time. Shit, it'll be our turn soon. Mrs Mak, Mr Lam, bye. I don't know about you but I'm safe. Who cares about Chinese Literature. That's what you think. Those composition contests will stress you out if you can't get a piece or two into the finals. The principal will definitely want to see you too. It's like this every year and it's getting worse year by year. It's Wu's friend. You better be careful. Me? She likes you. All her classmates know. Stupid! Exactly the same. The Yangtze Gorges Hold... Pause. I didn't ask you to stop. It's broken. Now for the "Red Cliff". Son, where is the tape? I don't know. Teaching "Memory of a Beauty" again? Yes, it's been a year already. You have a Yangtze River tape. Yangtze River is changing every year. Dad wants to record the Wushan Gorge. After a year or two, Wushan will be flooded. Ching Where's my "The River Flows" CD? How would I know where you put it? Have you tried? Can't find it. No, it isn't here. Listening to this always reminds me of the "Red Cliff Prose Poem". That's been cut from the syllabus for a long time. We had it back then. "Sailing a boat with a dear friend" "Drinking and laughing" "People in the world" "Seem small and trivial" "Lamenting the limitations of life" "Envying the eternity of the Yangtze" "Soaring with fairies by our side, we travel" "Holding the moon in our arms, we die" Hey, the soup is drying up! - Lam - Cho Come in... Daddy - He's Uncle Lam. - Hi, Uncle Lam. Alan. - Hello. - Hello. Do you like Chinese? Yes. I've brought you some books. Sit over there. Have you read this book? - No. - No? This is very simple. You'll understand it even if you don't read Chinese because it has a lot of pictures. This one. You know what the kids are watching? The moon. Right. And the poem is called "Walking under the Moon". It's written by Li Bai. He stank. If we were packed in the same bus with him, we'd die. Smelly asshole. And now, he's now doing great in business. Using $800 to hire a private tutor for his kid. He's really something. It nothing to him. You know what? He pays $7,000 management fee every month. Wow! One more. What? - Enough. - What? Don't you have tea? Yes, Manhattan Ice Tea. You want me dead? Have you ever been drunk? How can you claim to be Li Bai's fan? It's never too late to cut my card and quit membership. You? You'll never change. Look, we all live our own lives. Understand? Why the lecture all of a sudden? It's called putting you down when you're sick! You were always number one in our class. Here. I'll take down the dartboard for Stone later. What's this? Here... Closing. Business is good. Why close it? The leasing contract is over. What are you planning to do next? Next? Go to Shenzhen maybe. One of my friends is opening a pub. He's offering me a salary plus boarding. And living standards are low up there. Shenzhen, aren't you afraid? Afraid of what? I'm the type who'll always be around. Give me your address. I'll pay you a visit sometime. You don't have the permit. Cockroaches? No, a book worm. A big one. When others keep mistresses... you keep a book worm. Me? It crawled out from this book. Isn't it yours? From Shing, 1979 It's a gift to you and you leave it here to feed worms. I just want to share it with others. Share? No one borrows it. Is it a gift from the author? The author is my teacher. Oh, I see. When will you write a book and give one to me? When? Why don't you try writing one yourself? Shouldn't you financially support the students? Right. You better finish your essay on drug abuse and incorporate it in your book, alright? You're naughty! If I write a book, I'll write about you. . Me? . Why not? What about me? How would you know when you're not me? There're so many varieties. Try this one. Childish. This one is better. Mr Shing is back. Let me do it. What else do you need? Those. I've chosen the famous writer... Ah Shing's "Common Sense and Knowledge" as our comprehension. One of the articles should be quite popular among you guys since it's about Love. "Love and Chemistry" Simplified characters? I'll give you 5 more minutes. Reading time limit is 20 minutes. If you can't understand any of the words, you can ask me. You may start now. "I have traveled" "every corner of my country" "Among everything I've seen" "I've never discovered the beauty of Xishan." Lam, please go on reading. Isn't the article easy? Okay, first question: the author states... that Love comes from Chemistry. What does he mean by Chemistry? Anyone? Anyone...No one. Ching Ching Not in? No such person. One of your students has the same name as Mom? Bad eyes. Or perhaps... Your Mom used to sit in front of me. All I saw was her ponytail. And that's why... I wish I were the teacher. Then I could see her face all day. Time to eat! Let's eat! When did she know you like her? Afterwards. Who is Ching? No one is picking you up? Concerned about my extracurricular activities too? Who is Ching? I just got the name wrong. Liar. I'll get off at this stop. I'm getting off here too. What're you doing? Don't. You want to hurt me. You're my student. Why would I hurt you? You're hurting me already. What do you want me to do? Act like a mute? Pretend that I don't know? You should respect my freedom. Whatever I feel is my own business. I do respect your freedom. But I worry about you... You don't have to. You better worry about yourself. The last stage of bladder cancer. Has to wash the bladder every day. A social worker helps him out now. Where's his wife? He's divorced long ago. No treatment center is taking him? He doesn't want to. I want to help him. To see him through his last journey. Do whatever you want. But I want your consent. Since when did I become the Chief Executive? Not just for him. I need to deal with my own problems. I thought that was solved years ago? I thought so too. Well, treat it as my holiday. I really want to settle all this. No matter what, I will come back to make dinner. Ah, yes. You've been a model wife for 20 years. Even Filipino maids have vacations. This afternoon, someone reminded me to respect others' freedom. Do whatever you like. "My old friend left me at the Yellow Crane Terrace" "To visit Yangzhou in the misty month of flowers" "His solitary sail becomes one with the blue sky" "Yet I see only the Yangtze on its way to heaven" And now, my favorite poem: "Seasons never end but how much do we remember" "An east wind stirs the night, and in the moonlight" Scallions? Don't you want it? Eat more of it and get smarter! I'm smart enough. I don't need it. Take some of these, you will be smart and diligent. You always like to tease me when we're eating. Don't be petty. And you're not petty? You just want to borrow it. Take it. Keep your word. Borrow what? Money again? What's all this about? Dad, he wants to borrow my digital camera. Go ahead and eat. I'll give you 2 rolls of film. Mom, digital cameras don't need film. How does it develop photos then? Plug it into the computer and print it out from the printer. Thanks. Mr Lam Sir Wu's composition won 3rd prize. - Really? - Yes. The award ceremony is next week at the Amenities Center. You should bring along some other students. And remember to take photos. Aren't you going? I'll be busy that day. Remember to take photos. Okay. Mr Lam... What award? Wu's "Drug Abuse" essay. Ah, it's so her style. No wonder she won. How'd you know? She always sleeps in my class. That means she parties all night. Nothing strange if she tried drugs. Time for class. I need to pee, Dad! Come in. Why are you watching me? Why are you so angry? When you were little, I held you to pee. Don't take so long! Be snappy. Wash your hands! What is the code for the character "fan"? H-J-J-U So slow. Aren't you tired working day and night? You go to sleep first. The prize for the champion is these pens. Don't mind the judges. They're dumb. I think your essay should've won first prize. The 2nd runner-up is Ms Wu from Ren Secondary. "2001 Award Ceremony of the Essay Competition." Ms Wu, please. I'll think about it. Want to see something else? I'll come again. Okay, thank you. Hello. Hi. Stupid! Is that it? Not excited at all? I'm excited seeing you. Choose one for your wife. Half price since my boss isn't around. Business is quite good here. This is a famous plaza. Every shop pays $10,000 rent. There's one cheaper down the hallway. I plan to open up a shop with two friends. You must be rich. I'll talk to my Dad. I have a Dad and he loves me. I'm not one of those poor darlings who lacks parental love. So why... Why do I like you? Because I'm your teacher? Don't you have confidence in yourself? Am I wrong? I'm old. I've a wife and kids. I'm not handsome. I'm not rich. Why do you like me? Excuse me...hello! - Welcome! - Hello! These are new. - May I try? - Please do. Excuse me. You look cute! Not really suitable. Next time. - It's okay. - Sorry. Excuse me. You speak Japanese? A little. A Japanese boy kept trying to date me. Ask your Dad to send you to Japan for university. I thought we have no class today. Don't you want to go to university? My Dad, brother and sister all went to university. We don't need so many graduates in a family. Let's go. To where? Just come. Ah Bo, you look after the shop. I'll be back soon. There's a fast food court and a fishball place downstairs. It's coke! Yeah, it's coke! Haven't had cola cola a long time, He asked about you. He liked you the most out of the whole class. Not really. Look at it separately. Everyone knew he liked you more than anyone. The management office was complaining about the leakage in our toilet. The water leaks into the apartment below. Alright. I'll buy a tube of glue and fix it tomorrow. The old tube is not used up yet. The old tube has been there for ages. It's all dried up. Look. The house is small but crammed with people. And trash. The old toys and clothes take up 10 boxes already. They're Ang's old toys. He doesn't want to dump them. I'll take the old clothes to the Salvation Army soon. Soon? When is soon? You're like my Mom. You never throw anything away. She treats all trash like treasure. You think I'll have money to get a bigger house? What are you trying to say? Nothing. Whatever. We've been together for so long. Can't you understand my situation? Believe me. Just once! I believe you, Ching. I believe you haven't changed at all in 20 years. You really think so? The truth is right in front of me. But it's not your fault. It's mine. They're fighting. About what? Who knows? Find out yourself. Go and look. $10 No, $20. Whatever, quick. Over as soon? Yep, my money! What? Why not? It's not my business. Quick. You're worse than a loan shark. No way. That's embarrassing! Every disc has a security bar code. Are you sure? That stupid? Really? Really embarrassing. Gotta go. My boyfriend is staring at me. Alright, bye. It's okay! This isn't a video phone. Who knows who my boyfriend is? I heard you failed Economics. I can give you lessons. Are you joking? Or you want to ease your guilt? I'm not falling for this chick. I only want to give her tuition. Why can't life be simpler? You sound democratic and open-minded in class. But you're just a piece of antique after all! I am a piece of antique all along! I've been a stiff all my life. After being the best student, I want to be the best father the best husband and the best teacher. Stiffs attract people to try and bend them. And you're here to bend me? Bend a little and take a holiday. Non-stop examination without a holiday can kill. Your eyes look scary. The way you stared at the old man... You hate people having "disabled" meals? Really? I thought you were sympathetic. That you'd give him a tissue. He reminds me of someone... A relative. Someone you dislike? I don't dislike him. But... You won't understand. I'll tell you a story. It's easier for you to understand. There's a beautiful girl. She has a pair of long legs. And she is my neighbor. When I was eleven or twelve my heart beat faster whenever I saw her. One day, I looked out the window and saw this beautiful girl again. She was waiting for a taxi. I thought I could look to my heart's content. Then, I saw her... spit and wiped it... with her shoes. I stayed back because I didn't want her to spot me. It's my fault. I shouldn't say you're not sympathetic. Then you won't have to tell a dumb story... to defend yourself. Tell me a better story. Nothing left to say, really! Quick. Think of something! Nothing. Nothing? How did you flirt with girls in the past? I use my sincerity to move them. Dad Where's Mom? Mom called to say she can't make it. Told me to buy dinner. Hey, it's... Can't she play mahjhong? Come on, let's go out to eat! Call Ang to join us at the restaurant. Thanks. Dad, eat. Come on, eat. Enough? Eat. He fainted. I sent him to the hospital. Sorry. What did the doctor say? What did the doctor say? I don't think he'll get out. Did you... Did you tell him about it? What? Ask your Mom when you have time. She will tell you. Let's go. - Know what? - Don't know. "Page of Swords" is a woman with swords. Ferry's here! Dad, let's go! Wait for me. The ferry, Dad! Hurry up! Yangtze River is the longest river in China. She is beautiful. She passes through a lot of provinces. And one of them is called Hubai. Hubai has a city called Wuchang. In Wuchang, there's a place called Yellow Crane Terrace. Right here. We now know where Yellow Crane Terrace is. So we can start studying the poem for day. "Farewell at Yellow Crane Terrace" The poet is the one I mentioned before. The famous one. - Li Bai - Correct. "My old friend left me at the Yellow Crane Terrace" "Ku ren" is an old friend. Same as old buddy? Lam, quick! Right, old buddy. Where is he heading? "To visit Yangzhou in the misty month of flowers" In March... It's foggy and flowers start to blossom. He has to go to Yangzhou. "His solitary sail becomes one with the blue sky" Li Bai saw his friend aboard the boat disappearing into the distance. "Yet I see only the Yangtze on its way to heaven" What is left is only the River Yangtze flowing to the edge of the sky. Have you been to the Yangtze? Lam, you'd better train up. When you finish your university exams we'll go to the Yangtze together. We studied so many poems about the river. We should go there in person at least once. I've never been there. Are there any sailing boats left? Ask your Dad to bring you there. Then you will know. Okay? Come on, read it to me! "My old friend left me at the Yellow Crane Terrace" "To visit Yangzhou in the misty month of flowers" "His solitary sail becomes one with the blue sky" "Yet I see only the Yangtze on its way to heaven" Aren't you afraid? You know those brats. Principal Something wrong? Yes, don't you know? He was very pissed off. Really? He bumped into Wu this morning. She was swearing. He scolded her and wanted her to write an apology. So that girl started cursing all his ancestors! A lot of people were watching. And then she said she is quitting school. Don't you think that's something. Mr Lam Choose one out of the two. Due by the end of class. - Mom - Why so early today? Sore throat. So I came back early. You're ill. Take some medicine and you'll be ok. Mom, may I look at photos of you and Dad when you were young. I'll find them for you in a minute. Mom Dad told me the first half of a story. He said you will finish it. Where did he stop? He mentioned your Chinese teacher, Mr Shing. Have you told your parents? No. But this is serious. Am I pregnant or did I get AIDS? Mom and Dad understand me. What about the general exam? Should I talk to the principal? Isn't it better if I am not your student? Do you think I'm sexier in uniform? I'll wear it if you like. My treat. Bingo. Sorry. You're naughty. Lam, you're detained after class. 1979, a day before the school results were out everyone was worried and perplexed. So was I. Pregnancy Test: Positive I wished that tornadoes and earthquakes would crash the world. Then everything can be settled. But the world is never that perfect. You'll get a heat stroke running that fast! I remember it was very hot that day. The crickets were noisy. I have resigned. I have to go to Taiwan. My father-in-law got me a job there. It's the editor for a university press. Before I came back to teach I used to work as an editor. My wife's family is in Taiwan. His wife is Taiwanese. She dislikes Hong Kong. He said when the baby's due it will be easier to handle. They've been married for ten years with no kids. Why at this time? I was very angry- Not because I found out his wife was having a child. It was the way he told me. Whatever he said afterwards meant nothing to me. Didn't he know that you were pregnant? When a teacher you loved suddenly turned into a person you despised there was nothing left to say. I was very nervous when the train was at Lo Wu. I wanted someone to help me. You knew he liked you? I only knew he would do me this favor. When was your last period? Is that your boyfriend outside? Is he over 21? Our rules here state that an adult relative must be present with a minor who is going to have an abortion. When I came out, I started to cry. He asked if I was afraid. Our family started on that day. In fact... Did you love Dad? What do you think? If I married him only to solve my problem do you think we could stick together for 20 years? David is here. Bring your friends over. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for coming. Please go to that room. It's so packed and stuff here. The air-conditioning over there is a lot better. Melinda, ask Susan to bring her friends here. Nice meeting you. Thank you. Have a seat and I'll talk to you later. Bring me some beer. Linda, get some beer for our boss! Fortune telling! Sir, $5 for a life. Very cheap, choose a card. Amy, leave him alone. He's my friend. Read your palm elsewhere. Are you deaf? This place is pretty classy. Yes. Like a flea market. I never thought I would end up here and open an air-conditioned flea market. David Copperfield will be performing soon! Really? Yes, of course! China is a huge country littered with talents. Our David Copperfield has a beard. You may say he's Chinese. You can play with him, you know? Whatever. I'll get you some lamb satay. Be back in a minute. Make yourself at home. I'll talk to you later. Excuse me... Here, lamb satay! Delicious, eat while it's still hot. There're a lot of pubs on this street. Yeah, this is the Lan Kwai Fong of China. Then business will be tough. That's why we need gimmicks. To stir up the place and attract more people. Once we get reputation, we're on! Gimmicks? Your gimmicks are a little... Take it easy. It's opening night. I'm just interested in business. Gal, you're driving me nuts. Ten years back and I'd have gobbled you up. Why not now? Nah. Now I like women in their 30s, the administrative kind who can support me. Change the place into a gigolo bar! There's too much competition from hookers. Very interesting! I'll come back to you later. Don't go! This chick is really something! Ang means unharmed. Your father gave you that name. Why is he a teacher? I mean... He taught at a night school while he was studying. He had to pay the rent and feed you. I wouldn't be a teacher if I were him. Will you lay the table? That man, why do you still care? Didn't you say you despise him? Ching... Ching! I once fantasized marrying him. Seeing him everyday. Then I blamed him for everything. I told myself I was the victim. And that I hated him. I was torn between these two feelings until... I see a sick old man all alone at the end of his life. Suddenly, both my love and my hatred were gone. I only feel sorry for him. No one mentions him in this house. Courtesy saw your Dad and I through a twenty-year marriage. When can we stop evading the issue? Ten! Ten! All. Five. This is fun. 5, none. 10! 10! It's ok, I'll do it. Mom, are you alright? People like novels... to have a beginning and an ending. But not every ending fulfills your expectation. Perhaps I want to be there for him at his end. Perhaps I just want to see him suffer. Drink! Drink! Drink... Teachers have no power now. If they discipline students they get beaten up after school. When we were students teachers love to grill Yue. Of course! He was skinny, lazy and loathsome. Whoever gave him a place in Form 1 should be blamed for everything! And that's why you protected him. I was truly a clever student. I knew... having a friend like Yue always makes me superior. Isn't that true? He was involved in gang fights. He was dumped by hundreds of girls. He even went to jail once. He is super! Are you drunk already? Like tonight... What about tonight? Coming all this way here to visit Yue... It's his grand opening, right? What a good excuse. People must've forced you to self-reflect when you were young. As for me... I never doubt myself. Let's go. It's still early. We have to cross the border before it closes. Is that important? You have to get used to it. Get used to what? Not seeing me in class. Maybe it's a good thing. You'll know when the time comes. You're beginning to miss me already. What are you thinking? An excuse for your wife? An excuse for yourself? Why do we need to explain? No exam is great. Life is a never-ending examination. Life is really hard for you. You're always joking in class. Did you learn all the jokes from a book? I don't know why I fell for you. I think... I remember how it started. It was during dictation class. You sat there staring at the window. Like what you did just now. I tore out a piece of paper and drew you. When I become a director, I will definitely film that scene. You think it's funny? I always get what I want. What's taking you so long? Fixing my hair. Dad Dad Take off your clothes. lam doing the laundry now. Ching I slept over in Shenzhen last night. How's Yue? Not too bad. Business is good. Last night... You're late. Get changed. My class is at 9:15. I was in Shenzhen... I told him the whole story. Really? I finally have the guts to tell him. How is he? Talk to him when you have time. I will. Ching... Mom, you haven't signed my letter. Alright. Hurry up, I'll be late. It's hot. Chan, time to eat. Good, good. Get your wallet. Lam, time to eat. Let's go. - I'm not going. - You have to eat first. Work later. I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead. - Sichuan Noodles. - Leave him alone. Let's go. "My First Time" This is a composition topic I gave my students. When I was marking them I suddenly recalled my unforgettable first moments. The first time I realized I love Chinese Literature was because Mr Shing became our teacher. The first time I fell in love was with my classmate. Her name was Ching. She was sitting right in front of me. I enjoyed smelling her shampoo every day in class. The first time I felt I was important was on the day you were born. That wrinkled face sleeping in the cradle. Crying like a kitten. When I held you, I didn't know what to do. But I felt this splendid feeling rushing up inside me. The world became tender. And I became essential. In no time, you were no longer a kitten. But an adventurer setting off to look for his first time. In a quiet corner there is a brand new "First Time" waiting for him. He's been unconscious 3 days. Mr. Shing Mr. Shing I'm Lam. Haven't talked to you for a long time. Remember the book and the two pens you gave me? I threw some away and gave out the rest. But whatever you asked to memorize is still in my head. Let me recite one piece for you: "In the autumn of the year jen-hsu A friend and I went out on a boat that passes the Red Cliff. The breeze is fresh and the water is unruffled. As I drank with my friend I hummed a poem and sang a phrase on its strange beauty. The moon rises from the eastern hills and wanders among the stars. White dew above the river draws a line beneath the sky. Letting the boat go where it pleases we drift over the endless flow. Sailing the void and riding the wind we know not where to stop. Leaving the world and standing alone we sprout wings to join the immortals. As I drink the wine I compose a song: Oars of orchid wood row through the moon's drifting light. Thoughts fly far away for my loved one in a corner of the sky. A friend plays a flute, harmonizing my song. The flute makes a wailing sound resenting, longing, lamenting, protesting trailing the night like endless silk" You better write a good one or I'll get someone to beat you up. How dare you say that? Okay. I'll write "He's a Rambo". Okay? You can be a cop, security guard or even a salesman. That's fine. I want two copies. One for job application; another for Form 6 application. Just in case. In case? Okay, I'll write... "Super hacker and lady killer". Alright? I'll write you something good. Mr Lam, write "Big breasts no brains" for her. What? Did I break your heart? - Kiss and tell? - Go to hell! Hey, keep it clean until the elderly are gone. Him? He's leaving. Thanks for coming. Stay seated, please. Pills, anyone? No, you're the King of pills! Sir Hi! I've called you many times. My phone was stolen. I changed my package. It's Wu. Wu, payback time! Hurry up! Come on! Can I use my credit card? Long time no see. How are you lately? Never been better. I saw your boyfriend with a new BMW outside. Chi is there drinking wine. Let's join him! How're you? I'm opening a shop. You convinced your Dad? Easy. I'm going to India to buy stuff for my shop. I thought people go to Japan for that. Too expensive. Indian is in! You don't know this kind of thing. Of course. I may go to Kashmir too. Very dangerous. So? I'll call you when the shop opens. Okay. The air-conditioner is getting noisier. I'm too used to it to notice. Now that you mention it, it is noisy. In fact... If you don't want to live with me, let me know. I can always look for a job. True, you know how to type Chinese. The mortgage is settled. When I have time, I can come home to see the kids. Let's talk about it after our trip to Yangtze. We studied so many poems by Li Bai and Du Fu. We should at least visit it once. The weather is a bit hot. But if we don't go now the gorges will be flooded and nothing will be left.
