History is our witness. Because of traitors like Vibhishan and Jaichand we became slaves. This is a story about the enslavement of a tribe that was once the pride of Rajputana Army. We were called the Khameran. We had a glorious past. The jungles of Rajputana were our world and our home. RAJPUTANA When the Mughals set their eyes on Rajputana, our brave and valiant ancestors stood by the Rajputana army to face the Mughal Empire. Then Time turned our world upside down. The Mughals defeated Rajputana and we, the Khameran, were uprooted from our land and driven into exile to Kaza, North India. Caste divisions dominated life in Kaza back then. Drunk with arrogance, Kaza's upper caste threw us out, believing that we were low caste. Centuries passed. Generations changed. And slowly Kaza's desert swallowed us up, one by one. The end of the Khameran was near. That is when he appeared, to write a new chapter in our story. He cared little for history, nor hungered for praise. He would say: Bandits by duty, freedom our faith. Such was the glory of us Khameran. SHAMSHERA. 'Bandits by duty, freedom our faith' Shamshera A storm encircling his breath Eyes of an eagle in flight No one can stop him As he breaks across the sky like the dawn A dagger dug deep in his back Darkness all around The one who defies death Is a man called Shamshera Under Shamshera's leadership, from brave soldier we became fearful dacoits. We no longer endured tyranny, but inflicted it on Kaza's upper caste. They imagined us attacking every wedding and festival. Shamshera Shamshera Shamshera Shamshera Shamshera Shamshera 'Shamshera.' We are the stars battling the darkness We shall spread bright light across the sky In our hearts dwells a single obsession That the world know us as 'Shamshera' Know us as 'Shamshera' Fearing Shamshera, Kaza's upper caste rushed to their new masters, begging them for protection. Shamshera and his tribe have made our lives hell. Only you can save us from these savages, Governor Sahib. These Khameran are the rewards for your sins. How long can animals endure whipping? Ah, Inspector Shuddh Singh! Yes, sir. You know animals live in filth. These wretched Khamerans have made our jungles filthy. Whereas we upper caste never leave dirt out in the open. We gather it. There's a twofold profit for you in this. You'll get slaves for free, and 50,000 grammes of gold. Shamshera and his tribe are our problem now. Shamshera! Anyone who challenges his might Will be turned into dust Anyone who tries to catch him is in peril Warn them loud and clear Even nature trembles before him When he lifts his weapon No one dares to come in his way When he strides forth Pir! Shuddh Singh, have heard many tales of Shamshera's bravery. Now I have proof of it. Spare the white soldier's life. How long can you hide in these jungles? They are many in number. They have guns and gunpowder. All they can do is to sever our proud heads. Besides, what use is living branded as low caste? Look, Shamshera, I may work for the British, but I am an Indian at heart. That's why I bring my Indian brother a proposal of great benefit. The whites have given their word. Your savages will live amongst them in dignity. You'll be given land miles away from this whirlwind of prejudice. Make your homes there. The Khameran will rise again. All you have to do is surrender! It could be a trap. Maybe it is. But if they keep their word, our next generations will live in dignity again. When we had surrendered, the British gave us land next to the Azaad river. A so-called free land. Inside the fort of Kaza. When Shamshera entered the fort, he knew he had made a fatal mistake. A mistake that every Khameran would have to pay for. With chains around our choking necks and shackled wrists, we were led into the fort, now as slaves. First our bodies were flayed, then our souls were beaten down. Our self-esteem was so deeply damaged that every Khameran feared to even dream of freedom. You wanted to see me, Shamshera? I trusted you. And you put a dagger in my back. Because I did not have a sword! Double the amount of gold your upper caste gave us, and you could have the freedom of your tribe. Kaza's upper caste gave us 50,000 grammes of gold to wipe out your tribe. Double it and free your precious savages. I accept, I accept. On one condition: Give it to me in writing, on official paper. What have you done, Shamshera? How can we find the gold to buy our freedom? - Is this the future you promised us? - Enough of this madness. We regret trusting you. We won't do it again. Enough! Let's go. Listen to the Azaad river's waves. Do you know why the river has such life and force? Because it is not imprisoned within the walls of a fort. Bandits by duty, freedom our faith. Such was the glory of us Khameran. I have wounded our pride, Pir. I will restore our lost glory, come what may. 190 years ago when Nawab Kazak-ud-Daula built this fort, he dug a secret tunnel in it, so he could escape his enemies. This tunnel is said to lead to the Azaad river. If Shamshera could escape, he'd find a way to pay the price of freedom. Like one possessed, he began to search for the tunnel. The tunnel must be under these dark waters. Even if the tunnel exists, we do not know how deep it is. - That's what I will find out. - Meaning? The higher l climb, the deeper I'll fall. What you are about to do is pure madness, Shamshera. I'll throw the dice for the last time. If I win, then freedom is ours. And our unborn child? I want him to be proud of me. Remember, if I get caught, disown me. Disown me. Think it over again, Shamshera. I can only think of my people, Pir. The Scholars came from God's mouth. The Warriors came from His arms. The Wealthy came from His thighs. The lower caste came from His feet. And you are the dirt beneath those feet. When the Maker Himself made no place for you, what gives you the right to breathe? You live thanks to the kindness of the British. And you wished to abandon your people? Why? You wanted to escape? To leave Shuddh Singh's kingdom? Don't you have a wife and child? How old is this unborn insect? Shall I hang you both with your husband? Shamshera is a traitor. He was deserting us, running away like a coward. His wife has exposed him! If a termite dies a termite's death, all the more fun! Remember, when a stone hits his skin, he must bleed. - The traitor! - Cheat! - Don't spare him. - He must die! Well done! - Put him to death! - Hit him! The enemy believed Shamshera's death would crush our dreams. But our story was about to begin. Because the tide was impatient to turn again. 25 YEARS LATER The water has come! The water has come! Move! Keep moving! Get away! My belt? It's gone. Jump! Here, Balli. White ladies wear them. They keep your hands cool. Not all hands are the same. Even ice can't cool the hands of a Khameran. What did you steal? An English comb. Put it in your hair and watch it move. Let's see. Ghungroo! You need English hair for it to work. Now tell me. You are Khameran, so what am I? An officer! You scoundrel! Look what's happened to us. Don't turn them into thieves too. Thieving runs in Khameran blood. - I like making their blood boil. - So, what are you? I am not a Khameran. Can't you see my uniform? Be off with you! You're the expert at escaping. It runs in your blood. You son of a damn traitor! Tell me something new, Khajoori. I've heard that line all through my childhood. Catch the traitor's son and I'll return the stolen goods. Stop right there! Yes, my lord! Throw me a salute Day and night Here comes the great one Don't hold yourself back Throw me a salute Day and night Here comes the great one Don't hold yourself back We thieve from thieves We fill every lane with our madness Say after me: 'Yes, my lord!' Say after me: 'Yes, my lord!' Yes, my lord! On your guard! Heads that bow are loyal Everyone here is at my beck and call My breath blows through these lanes My hopes don't believe in the impossible I'm a man who dances to his own tune So what if I'm impatient? That's a good thing My breath blows through these lanes My hopes don't believe in the impossible I'm a man who dances to his own tune So what if I'm impatient? That's a good thing Yes, my lord. We steal from thieves We fill every lane with our madness Say after me: 'Yes, my lord!' Yes, my lord! My lord. Say after me: 'Yes, my lord!' Say after me: 'Yes, my lord!' On your guard! Heads that bow are loyal Everyone here is at my beck and call At my beck and call Yes, my lord! Come on, you Khameran. Want to become an officer? Ruin these children and hell will close its doors on you. Come. She'll take care of him. Let's go. Father ran away. Looks like mother is going to run off too. Does it make you happy teaching children to steal? It makes me happy making trouble for these savages. They are not bad people, Balli. They're just scared. And fear makes us humans do terrible things. Scared of what? Do you know what they call me? 'The traitor's son.' Stop this nonsense! They have filled my heart with poison. Give me some more. What great feat did my father pull off to earn me this title? Traitors are often cowards. Was he a coward? I'm giving you the chance to rid yourself of your sin. When I become an officer, I will never come back to this hell. Mark time! 1, 2, 1. Turn right. Mark time! According to the new rules, if any savage, insect or Khameran is seen here, he'll be shot on sight. Upreti Sahib, I keep telling you, I'm not a Khameran. I've trained for years. Just help me meet the Inspector. I'll win medals too. Why so keen to become an officer? Come to the training grounds tomorrow. - Sure? - Sure! You'll be the force's first Khameran officer. Khamerans, step aside! An officer is approaching! Pir Baba, you'll go up in flames, cremating all these Khamerans. I am not cremating them, I'm putting them to rest. The dead cannot know peace till all our people are free. You made trouble again? Balli, if the officers see you, they will shoot you. So when can I show off your training, Pir Baba? What I teach you isn't for show, Balli. If I don't show them my skills, how will I become an officer? How will I escape this cage? Like this. Hold your breath longer. That isn't enough. But what for? - What is this, Pir Baba? - A new lesson. Run! You make me chase chickens, geckos and bees. You call this training? Want to be an officer? When I'm an officer, I'll have a gun, and my own police station. I won't be chasing bees. Then stop. Don't run. Enough for today, Pir Baba? This is for your children. Bloody bribe-taker! Here comes the merchant's son. What have you brought us? The usual. Salt, oil, wood. And here. - Illiterate fool, what use is to you? - The pictures make me dream. Queen's crown will tour India. Who owns this crown? The Queen of England. The Queen's crown will soon tour the whole country. You can join the tour. - Why not! - Go! I'll take my Sona with me. Is she coming? Sona refuses to go anywhere, but just loves coming to the fort. - Who knows what attracts her here. - If you had a heart, you'd understand. - What don't I get, fool? - Here's your money. I don't want to invite sin by touching Khameran money. As if you were the son of the Lord of Wealth. - Your father became rich by stealing. - Quiet, you rascal! My father is a respectable Nagina citizen. - You'll get shot someday. - Only if I'm caught. The effect of your bewitching eyes Is renouncing the world in the name of love Eyes that do not lure have no price here Words that do not seduce have no worth here Feel my heart beat fast, it will never learn I tease and taunt Make you drunk with love These bewitching eyes These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job They've cast their spell, sullied my name They've cast their spell, sullied your name These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job Your dark eyes have weaved magic Then why does kohl get blamed? Your dark eyes have weaved magic Then why does kohl get blamed? Come, beloved. Let me hide you under my lashes Come, beloved. Let me hide you under my lashes I will look at no other lover nor will you These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job Wonderful! Bravo! Move! Closed doors Broken promises Love has turned many princes into paupers Laila lost her life for love Manju lost his faith Tales of their romance are told in the cities of poets Laila died, Majnu betrayed Laila died, Majnu betrayed But I won't break my promise to you He never breaks his promises You are all I want, so don't turn your eyes away Just look at this poor lover Reeling in love You fell for my alluring looks And paid a hefty price These bewitching eyes These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes have done their job These bewitching eyes of yours These bewitching eyes of yours Excellent! These bewitching eyes of yours These bewitching eyes of yours When our eyes meet, I surrender to you When our eyes meet, I surrender to you She is my beloved, why would she test my love? She is my beloved, why would she test my love? Don't ask her to light a lamp When her beauty can set the city on fire These bewitching eyes of yours These bewitching eyes of yours The magic of your eyes Your eyes The magic of your eyes The magic of your bewitching eyes has done its job Bravo! Why do you keep following me? What do you want? You. Where are they? The Inspector is looking for them. Will you wear them? Like hell I will. Wait, Sona. Marry me. Why? What's special about you? Where are those rascals? I'll keep you like a queen. I'm already a queen. Right? But the day you become a king, I might consider it. Done? Can we go? You look handsome in your uniform, Balli. Sir, he's here. Who? The man who wishes to become the first Khameran officer. Wishes? Or has a death wish? Go away. Go on, you can start! - Damn you! - Get away. Wonderful! You're really amazing. Act like an officer. You're a proper officer. Tell me, what is an officer's primary duty? To punish criminals, sir. Bravo! You're smart too! Shall I get you a criminal? Balli... Punish the culprit. - He's just a child, sir. - No, he's a Khameran. An insect, filth, thief. Thirty lashes. Let's go. Either you do it, or I'll do the honours. No matter what, a Khameran will be punished today. Punish me instead of the boy. So be it! Let Kesu go, sir. Why? Let him watch. One Khameran must watch another being whipped. If not, who will? An upper caste? Kesu. Look there. Kesu. You could never be an officer, you fool. A Khameran always a Khameran. Balli... With your background, your caste and your status, he wanted to rule over you vermin. Can a lowly insect ever touch the sky? Anyone who has tried has been punished. Move aside. Balli! The traitor's blood flows again. Shall I ask them to start the stoning? Shall I give him the same death as his father? Your blood is cursed, woman. If we had hung you with your husband, you would not need to see this day. Why doesn't mother tell me how father died? Did they kill him? Come. Let me apply medicine. I got thirty lashes, Pir Baba. But your silence stings more than those lashes. What could your mother have said? Your father had a heart of gold. Even so, they stoned him and then hung him. It was I who threw the first stone. It was I who defamed him by calling him a traitor. My Shamshera was not a traitor. He was our leader. Your savages will live in dignity. Just surrender. You cannot save your tribe from our onslaught. But if they keep their word, our future generations will live in dignity. I accept. 'Bandits by duty, freedom our faith.' We were once so glorious! I will restore our lost glory, come what may. The higher l climb, the deeper I'll fall. Do you know what they call me? 'The traitor's son.' The traitor's blood flows again. Shall I ask them to start the stoning? Your blood is cursed, woman. Balli! Shamshera's blood runs in your veins. I was worried that you'd become fearless like him. Balli! Come down. Balli, get down! Give me that gun! Get down. Get down, you damn traitor's son! We fled under the cover of night, while he blinds us with sunlight. A storm encircling his breath Eyes of a flying eagle No one can stop him As he breaks across the sky like the dawn Sir, we've found the rascal's body. But we can't identify him. The well creatures have chewed up his face. Once you leave the fort, they'll take you for dead, Balli. They'll think the dead Khameran was you. Memorize this map. AZAAD RIVER, KAZA FORT, JUNGLE Follow the Azaad river's flow. It will show you the way. Once you enter the world outside, remember, every Khameran's dream of freedom is now tied to you. You do not know the way nor do you know your destination. If you should lose your way, listen to the Azaad river. It will take you to a high mountain. You must cross that mountain. When night falls, keep your eye on the brightest star in the north. It will show you the path ahead. At dawn, make your way to the valley. There you shall see the mountain's shadow. It will point you to Nagina City. There's a small town on Kaza's southern border. With the Goddess's blessings, you'll find Doodh Singh there. He'll help you in your mission. That is if he's still awaits his leader, Shamshera. Hey, Uncle. Stop, will you? Let go of me, you fool. What are you doing? - Why are you making my life hell? - Where is Nagina? Perched on my head! Stop, you rascal. Raasho? - Raasho? - Who's that? - Balli. - Balli! - What are you doing here? - I escaped. Catch that thief. He's selling Nagina's temple bells. The atheist! Shamshera? I heard my father speak of him. Balli, these white rogues won't spare their own fathers even. So can you trust them? Even if you give them the stolen gold? What matters to them is the gold's glitter, not where it came from. Their greed will free us. 'This jungle was once ruled by a fierce lion. 'He kept leaping high, trying to touch the sky. 'No garland around his neck, no crown on his head. 'But his gait was that of the king of the jungle. 'He could dethrone any king, this strong-minded Khamera. 'An embodiment of courage! His name was Shamshera.' Did you know my father? Tell me. The same eyes, the same features, the same charming gait. Just like my old friend. Untie me. Give me your hand. Who are you? I was your father's companion. I drew this map. I'm the man you were looking for. Uncle to you. Doodh Singh? Shamshera was far-sighted. He always said: 'If friendship is based on fear and vulnerability.' 'it can never be fully trusted.' So when he surrendered to the English, he left behind some of us Khamerans. Nagina! This city of temples gave us shelter. Hide your mark. This city is full of people with something to hide. Some hide their shadows, others their sins. What could be a greater cover than religion? BABA HAS TAKEN AN OATH OF SILENCE... PLACE DONATIONS IN THIS BOX So that's what we did. We hide our identity and blended in with the folk here. NAGINA CENTRAL ARMOURY How dare you touch my horse? Think you're better than this animal? You good-for-nothing, you dirty vermin. Move! For twenty-five years, many of us lived amongst people who despised us. The Nagina city ends here. And the jungle starts here. As time passed, the weak-willed accepted their new lives. But others still dreamed of freedom. So whenever we could, we met in this jungle. We believed our Shamshera would return in some shape or form and free us. Dada. 'If unseen, a Khameran can escape death.' This became the mantra for our survival. Some of our men died waiting for Shamshera. And those who live stand before you. Dada, Gulfi, Gajendra, Malhaar's son Bhura and Pitambar. Look at him! The boy stands tall as a mountain. But that is only natural, after all, he's the son of Shamshera! Our time has come. Draped in a shroud, he came to bury the enemy alive Like a healer, he gave his foes a dose of his own medicine What are you staring at? If you like them, wear them. Balli? Where the hell were you? - I went on a trip. - A trip? A trip! - I'll show you a trip. - Are you mad? - Thick-skinned fool! - The tent's on fire. So you drowned? The others fell for it. I didn't. I know that. What do you want? Have you gone mad? Shuddh Singh is already after my blood. Fool! You want to challenge the English all alone? I'm not alone. I have a gang. A gang...? Now tell me. Will you help me? This time you're dead. See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star A fierce lion once ruled this jungle See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star He kept leaping high Trying to reach the sky See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star No garland around his neck, no crown on his head But he behaved like the king of the jungle See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star Go there! Move it! Look inside! Open up! Open the door. 'Dacoits have attacked the armoury in Nagina.' Read this, sir? Draped in a shroud, he came to bury the enemy alive Like a healer, he gave his foes a dose of his own medicine Kaza is heaving with gold, Balli. But we don't have enough men. - Who are you? - Chooha. I was the horse, donkey and cook at the merchant's wedding. I breathed again when I saw you robbing the merchant's house. I've had it. I cooked for them, saying I was of another caste. - But I am a pure Khameran. - Bravo! So even merchants are eating food cooked by Khamerans now! Let me join you. I can dig. Then dig! I hear there's a new dacoit in Kaza. He robbed Thakur Maan Singh. A Thakur? Don't forget this is a Nawab's shop. - Nawab Sahib! - Where's my safe going? RAM NARAYAN GOLD-SILVER SHOP Give me a puri. You'll find Khamerans hiding everywhere. They won't come out in fear of the British. They were scared. The Khameran have turned into mice like me. Shamshera's return has made them roar like lions. Every mouse, jackal, fox and wild bull will have its day Their time will come Whoever confronts us will die a sweet death Their time will come They will spray gunfire in every direction To the beat of the drum, if lightning strikes, we'll strike back See it fall. See it rise Like a rising star No, no. We know nothing. Swear to God. Even if we knew, would we tell you? MASKED DACOIT INFORMER GET A REWARD OF FIFTY GOLD COIN 'Attention! 'Anyone providing information on the masked dacoit will receive 'a reward of fifty gold coin.' Brother Balli. Look! There are posters of you on every Kaza wall. Excellent! They call you 'the masked dacoit'. What is it? Why are you closing the door? What if the masked dacoit shows up? Open the door! Open it! Long live our Guru! Long live our Guru! Let us cross the skies Cry out as we attack As we forge ahead We are the weapons all enemies fear Stop! A dagger dug deep in his back Darkness all around The one who defies death Is a man called Shamshera Draped in a shroud He came to bury the enemy alive Like a healer, he gave his foes a dose of his own medicine The British have assigned an army officer to catch the masked dacoit. Have they lost complete... faith in you? He has robbed weddings and festivals. You know that dancing girl, Sona? Her tabla player was saying, before they can even their show, the dacoits show up. When was the first robbery? The night of the officers' party at Nagina armoury. 18 March. - Who was performing there? - Sona. And the second robbery? On the 22nd. Thakur Maan Singh's mansion. And without Sona there's no celebration. The 25th, Lala's new shop opening. Sona was performing there too. On the 26th, Lala Haldiram's. Bring Sona here! Let her entertain me this time. First, I will skin you alive. Then stuff you with straw and hang you in the village square. Anyone who helps the masked dacoit will meet the same fate. Well? Do you think he'll come? She's pure gold, sir. How long can he resist? The day I saw you dance at the fort, I wanted to cover you with kisses. Now I want to whip that same body till you bleed. It would be painful either way, Inspector. Hope that didn't hurt? 'You're inviting trouble by eyeing the lioness.' Who was that? Who spoke? 'The lion is now awake. 'There's no hiding place under the sun 'All you can do now is run. 'Run, run!' - Why did you come? - Huh? Why did you come, you fool? - To save me, or to get me killed? - No, not now. Gold in any shape or form does not suit you, Inspector. Uncle, get the paint. It's time to leave our mark. KAZA POLICE HEADQUARTER. 'SHAMSHERA.' Get moving! Tell me. Where did this new Shamshera appear from? What the hell is going on here? Stop this madness! He's the white officer who's come to catch the new Shamshera. Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! 65 of your men are wounded, but not even one of his. Colonel sir. Indian dirt, only Indian hand can clean. White hand get black, sir. No need, sir. You go back, sir. Inspector Shuddh Singh, this is our Queen's crown. We protect it. Do you know why it's been touring India for the past three months? So that all Indians will know who their rightful ruler is. The Queen must be respected. Shamshera is the dirt on this crown. And that dirt will fall on me first. Indian dirt make hand get black. Today the Indian hand needs the hammer of the British. Inspector sahib, have a good day. Wear this. What is this? Why did you bring me to this jungle? There she goes again. Why did we invite more trouble? - She's all right. - Quiet. She's your sister-in-law. Why did you rescue me? Should I have married you off to Shuddh Singh? Why not? At least I'd be an Inspector's wife. Now I've had it. He used to suspect I was your spy. Now he knows it's true. So tell me. What do I do? She asks what to do. I say: 'Marry him'. So, marry me. Marry my shoe if you want. Then I'll have to live at your feet. Stop dreaming, Balli. I'm wide awake. Now marry me. You're not that special anymore. In your shade I could sleep In your mist I could lose myself Lose myself I could wander the world with you And teach you the language of love In your shade I could sleep In your mist I could lose myself You are that intoxication That makes me want to touch the sky Your love, my madness I can be the one you want Your love fills me with heady joy I can become the colour of your desire I am lost in my love for you I can take the form you want Your love, my madness I can be the one you want The rain of your love fell Flooding me with desire This boundless love Is ours for all to see The rain of your love fell Flooding me with desire This boundless love Is ours for all to see The rain of your love fell Flooding me with desire This boundless love Is ours for all to see Don't indulge in purposeless talk Or you'll loose the magic of this moment If you allow this idle night to pass us by in vain You cannot blame me for leaving Wait! Let me open my heart to you Let my heart say what it will I live for you and only you Seeking myself only in you Your love, my madness I can be the one you want Your love fills me with heady joy I can become the colour of your desire Your love, my madness I can be the one you want The rain of your love fell Flooding me with desire This boundless love Is ours for all to see The rain of your love fell Flooding me with desire This boundless love Is ours for all to see A white officer has come to catch Shamshera. I hear he put Shuddh Singh in his place. So, they've called an army officer? He came of his own accord. They say he chooses his own missions. It's not a calamity in name. Not good news all the same. Rumour has it he was about to be promoted and sent back to England, but he refused to go. He said he was too attached to India. He speaks Hindi like an Indian. - I see the merchant likes him. - Be quiet, you fool. - What does he look like? - He's tall and strong. Freddy Sahib loves playing 'lath-baazi'. He'll be chief guest at the wrestling bout. We'll meet him there. - What are you saying, Balli? - You'll meet him? You'll die, fool. You're digging your own grave. I want to thank him for showing that nasty Shuddh Singh his place. Come on! Get him. 'Lath-baazi' competition I'm sure you're dying to get in there. Come, Colonel Sahib! Taste Indian soil and face our fighters. Why not? Why not? Attention, everyone! Our chief guest, Colonel Freddy Sahib, will join in the contest. Is there anyone worth his salt who can take him on? Is there no young man who will meet his challenge? No one? Looks like you've won the bout before even it's begun. Colonel Sahib! Finally! Have you lost your mind? Are you mad? Shall we start? That's great! Finally, a lion. You'll meet many more lions when the time comes, Sahib. Lions don't wait for Time. Twenty-five years ago, a lion fought before its time. But he was killed. I have heard many rumours. Now I see it with my own eyes. What? That an army officer is here to catch Shamshera. Dead or alive. Alive, hopefully. Looks like Sahib is enamoured with Indian rebels. I love the country, not its rebels. So why alive? Every rebel has a story. It's important to understand it. For that you must know his history and people, Sahib. They are called Khameran! Shamshera dreams of their freedom, and I will fulfill that dream at any cost. Shamshera! Now is not the time to call out my name. Shamshera has not come to kill you, but to test you. You've passed the test. Surrender and you will live. Sahib. You are our guest, Sahib. So you must be respected. For that you must know his history and people, Sahib. They are called Khameran. They signed a treaty of freedom but were turned into slaves. Shamshera? I saw him dying, sir. He was stoned to death by his own people twenty-five years ago. Who knows where this new Shamshera has come from. 100,000 grammes of gold. It's insane that he even thinks he can collect that. It's not insane, Wilson, it's desperation. They were free men once and they want that freedom back. According to our estimate, they're halfway there. Sir, does he really believe that the British government will accept his stolen gold for the freedom of his tribe? Shamshera's plan hinges on the greed and corruption of the Empire. Colonel Sahib... Move! It's a wedding, sir. You must all come. Whose wedding is it? Mine, sir! What! Old wife dead, sir. So, bringing new fresh wife. Very fresh. Attention, everyone! Come, Colonel Sahib! - Our chief guest... - Shall we start? Shamshera dreams of their freedom. What are you looking for? 'The British government of Kaza must prepare to welcome us. 'We have started to amass the price of our freedom. 'Shamshera. 'See you at the wedding.' Shamshera's next attack will be at your wedding. He can't be that big a fool. There will be enough gold at your wedding to end his looting. This could be his last robbery. He wants to show us our place and prove his own importance. Very well, Sahib. How can one stop an uninvited guest? Reconsider. The white Sahib's army is waiting for you. If we're successful today, then this will be the last time we'll need to rob to gain freedom. Shall we go? - Pour the ghee into the sacred fire. - Why not? 'Piping hot the ghee is flowing. No trace of shame showing.' Svaha. You making halva? Balli, the Inspector is watching us. So what! Pay your respects. My respects. Inspector, did that hurt? - Pull me! - Come on up! Who'll straighten me up? Your father? This shiny gold will blind you. Out with it! Give me your gold. Shall I dig it out? Take this, lady, and go. Don't come back again today. Go, child. Go! Hold it! Shuddh Singh, what the hell? Forgive me, Colonel sir. We'll meet again, Sahib. Pitambar! Pitambar! Hold onto him! Balli! Bhura, the bag of gold will fall. Pitambar! Pitambar, Pitambar. Pitambar, Pitambar. Pitambar. You'll be fine. Pitambar! Brother Balli. Look! There are posters of you all over Kaza. Bravo! Excellent! - She's all right. - Quiet. She's your sister-in-law. If we stay here, those scoundrels will find us. They will take the gold from us. We must separate and go back to our old lives. Balli...he's right. For now, it is safer for us to live in disguise. What do you say, Bhura? Pitambar! You'll be fine. Very well. We'll split up for now. And meet here at sunrise on the morning of Diwali. The blood in your veins is yet to flow It matters little if you die Your name will last forever Your name will last forever Bhura. He died in my place. You can be frightened Yes, you can be broken In time you will learn to gather yourself And be mighty again You are that phoenix That shall rise again Uncle... Any work for me? You'll get one paisa a day. Take it or leave it. Come on. Move along. TILAKRAM PANSARI The sky belongs to you Drape yourself in bravery Forge ahead This is your final battle The blood in your veins still flows Even if death comes It won't be able to destroy you You can be frightened Yes, you can be broken In time you will learn to gather yourself And be mighty again You are that phoenix That shall rise again That shall rise again Move! You shall rise again You shall rise again The earth or the sky has swallowed Shamshera. We have to find him. That scoundrel has polluted my house. Now Shuddh Singh will wipe him out. Easy. Sit. Are you here to work? Or laze about? Coming, Sahib. Don't move from here. Diwali is a few days away. Stay strong till then. Am I anything like my father? Or am I just leading them to their deaths? Calm your thoughts, Balli. You said the day I became king, you'd accept me. Didn't you say that? I could not become king for you or for the Khameran. I could not become a king. You were always a king. Only you didn't know it. And now, we won't let you forget it. Listen, O man of the world Listen, O man of the world Water! Those who thunder down their path They do not live in doubt Those who are ready for the sacrifice Do not live in the fear of death BABA HAS TAKEN AN OATH OF SILENCE... PLACE DONATIONS IN THIS BOX Sahib, it's almost Diwali. Will that demon's shadow fall on our festival? When will you catch Shamshera? Without your help, it's impossible. Speak! The white officer says if you see any strangers near your shop or home, let us know at once. Thakur, may I speak? Colonel Sahib... Now that you have gulped the ocean And have survived hell You are proclaimed the saviour You are the saviour Your fury is like a whirlwind The divine speaks through you You are proclaimed the saviour You are the saviour The blood in your veins still flows Even if death comes It won't be able to destroy you It won't be able to destroy you You can be frightened Yes, you can be broken In time you will learn to gather yourself And be mighty again You are that phoenix That shall rise again You shall rise again You shall rise again You shall rise again You shall rise again The gold is safe. And our men? We set out as a whole group, but return broken. Pitambar dying was the beginning of our end. We will die chasing the illusion of freedom. So, we'll die. If we die for each other, who will enjoy the fruits of freedom? Our people will, Bhura. They're still enslaved in the fort. The enemy is too strong for you. They will feed on us like vultures. And I am not ready to die. Bhura! I told them you could not be persuaded. - Go inside. - Uncle, Balli? Save Balli! Sona! Balli! Sona! - Sona! - Balli! Balli. Bhura! Balli! Sona is back there. Sona is back there. Oh, you're pregnant? Come here! You've told us everything. Now tell us where the gold is. - No, Bhura, no. - Quiet. Tell us where the gold is. No, Bhura, no. You scum! You have endangered our future. Fire! No end to your breeding. Enough. You had your fun, Shuddh Singh, now stop. Your wife and child are safe with the white officer. We must go, Balli. Listen to me. As long as you're alive, they'll come to no harm. Hey you, old lady! Old lady! Old lady! Who'll unload the goods? My father? The situation is desperate. Dada, Gulfi uncle and Bhura are dead. Sona and the gold are both in their custody. - And Balli? - Balli... Balli and Doodh Singh have escaped. But I don't know where they are. Come on, hurry. I am a father now, uncle. But my wife and my child are in the hands of the enemy. And so are thousands of Khameran who dream of freedom. What you are about to do is pure madness. I'll throw the dice for the last time. If I win, then freedom is ours. And your Shamshera will stand proudly before you. Smile, sir. Smile. You may not smile now. But at least, you can face the Queen. You, mother... Mother Queen's crown coming to Kaza, sir. We both go salute, sir! ROYAL TOUR OF ST. EDWARD'S CROWN, INDIA Anyone who challenges his might Will be turned into dust Anyone who tries to catch him is in peril Warn them loud and clear Even nature trembles before him When he lifts his weapon No one dares to come in his way When he strides forth A dagger dug deep in his back Darkness all around The one who defies death Is a man called Shamshera A dagger dug deep in his back A dagger dug deep in his back Darkness all around Darkness all around The one who defies death The one who defies death Is a man called Shamshera Is a man called Shamshera SHAMSHERA DAINIK DARPAN 'Shamshera steals the Queen's crown.' Master, he's stolen the crown! A government who couldn't save their Queen's crown, can they protect us merchants from that devil? He stole the crown under their very noses. Who the hell is this Shamshera? How dare he humiliate the Empire? I'll get the crown back, sir. Just the crown will not satisfy the Queen. I want this Shamshera's head with it. Or I'll have yours. Hello? They say you couldn't even save your Queen's crown. What heartless people they are! Don't worry, sir. I am with you. What was that? FREDDY YOUNG. COLONEL. 59 SCINDE RIFLES. 'In 48 hours, Shamshera will meet you at the Kaza fort. 'He will return your honour to you and take our freedom.' Close the gates! Quick! No one is allowed out. Shamshera has stolen the crown to save the Khameran. - What? - Yes. If he keeps his word, he will come to the fort tomorrow morning and free his people. Really? He stole the crown! You dare laugh! No Khameran should stay inside. Drag them out of their houses. Attention! Balli! You should've trusted us, Sahib. Balli, we've been cheated. We haven't been cheated. The white officer has. Get out of the way, my friend! Didn't you show me that English newspaper? Now you will read this news in heaven. 'The white man died at Shamshera's hands. 'Shamshera died at Shuddh Singh's hands.' In whose hands did the crown land? In yours, sir! Brother Balli! Balli is alive! Balli! - He stole the crown to save us. - Has he come to free us? Balli is Shamshera. Balli! Master! How do I look? Like the king of Hindustan! Take this. The first gift from your king. Balli! Balli! You people killed Balli's father. You stoned him. You will have to answer for every drop of his blood. Answer for what? He was a damn traitor. He ran away to save us. His wife called him a traitor to keep us all alive. Balli! Balli! Balli! If you are already dead within what's the point of living. Our fear that killed Shamshera twenty-five years ago, that same fear will kill my son now. Your name will last forever A corpse dangling on a rope. Its head split open. Maggots crawling from it. And a body without life. That's how your father died. Be grateful I'm granting you an easy death. Balli! This jungle was once ruled by a fierce lion. He kept leaping high, trying to touch the sky. He could dethrone any king, this strong-minded Khamera. An embodiment of courage! His name was Shamshera. I trusted you. And you put a dagger in my back. So you would not live to see this day. Shamshera is a traitor. Go. Pir Baba! Found it! Time to be purified, Inspector sahib. A corpse dangling on a rope. Its head split open. Maggots crawling from it. And a body without life. That is how our Shamshera died. Be grateful I'm granting you the same fate. 'I leave something of greater value than the price of our freedom, 'your honour. 'Shamshera.' Shamshera! Shamshera! Bandits by duty, freedom our faith. Such was the glory of us Khameran.
