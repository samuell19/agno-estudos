Good night, sir. Hey, miss. Oh, thank god. Someone's here. Please, I need your help. My car always breaks down. I just need to use the phone. This area's... restricted. But there's nowhere else for miles. Miss, no. Oh, let me help you. Lars, I'm on vacation. Sit down. Have a pastry. Look... we have a situation. What about Malcolm, he's in Berlin. No. He's back in the states. Anyway, you're it. Relax. It's fast and easy. It's a babysitting job. May I get you something? No, thank you. I'll have another one of these. You sure you don't want a pastry? Tell me. Galina Konstantin. She's a high-tech thief who's been slipping us information for years. Now she's acquired some critical information from a reactionary party in Slovakia. I need you to handle the extraction. Specs. Her cover. She's some kind of circus freak. You leave for Slovakia tonight. You meet her near the border and take her to Munich. You'll be out of the country before the government knows what's up. We're going by train? The airport's too hot and all the other outs are blown. Here's her down payment. 50.000, American, unmarked. She gets the rest when she delivers the goods. Any ideas how to explain this to my wife? No. Your son needs a father who's around. You can't go running off. I'm not running off. I get time off from the hospital, too. But you're away for two days and... You think I like that interrupting? I don't know. June, you're in Rome. July, Washington. We've postponed it so many times, we had to pull the kids out of school. But Vladimir is an important client. They all are. When do we get to be important? Maddie, you and the kids are my life. My life. Come on. Why take the train? Can't you just leave later and fly? Vladimir will not fly. He's too heavy to leave the ground. Look, I'm sorry, ok? I... You're gonna miss your birthday. I know. We need to spend more time together, Jacques, as a family. I love you. I'll be back soon, ok? I promise. I love you. I love you too. And you stay out of trouble, ok? Show me what you've got. Good. One more time. Come on, faster. Yeah. That's right. Love you. Love you Dad. Who are you? What did you expect? I said, who are you? Jacques Kristoff. Go to the stage, keep your hands where I can see them. Move to the light, now. Keep your hands where I can see them. Walk towards the light. I wouldn't trust you if your tongue came notarized. Show me your I.D. You're sitting on it. Where's my money? Here's your money. And passport. We're taking the 681 to Munich. Let's get a few things straight. You don't tell me what to do. I don't need you, nor do I want you. This way. No. This is my show. Galina Konstantin. Come on. We're going up. Hold your fire. We want her alive. Stop shooting. Stop shooting. Jacques. Don't let her get away. Sorry, Jacques. Galina Konstantin is escaped. Let's move out of here. Hey, I just saw that girl. Evening, madam. Sorry. Emergency. Get down! Oh shit! Don't look back. Keep walking. Yeah, right. You want me to play it cool after you've blown up half of the city? What are you doing? Going to the ladies' room. Situation calls for a little finesse. Something you wouldn't understand. Make it quick. Hello? You call this a babysitting job? Fast and easy, hm? Oh, something went wrong? Did you hear what I said? Half the army's on our ass. But you'll make that train? Give me an out. I told you, there are no other outs. Now do whatever you have to do to get on Train 681. You hear me? Just get across that border. You got it. Not bad. By the way, I won't be needing this. Due to increased security measures, all passengers must have their passports ready for customs inspection. All packages and luggage is subject to search. Thank you for your cooperation. What do you want? Ladies and gentlemen. Train 681 to Munich with stops at Linz, and Salzburg, is now boarding. Go ahead. You, come with us. What have I done? Right now. What have I done? Come on. Don't... Hurry up. Where are your papers? Here. You are booked to go to Munich, sir. Enjoy the train. Excuse me. Yes, sir? I'd like to change compartments. Yes, sir. But... Do you have one with large Pullman bed? This is a very special trip for us. Thank you madam. I can move you to 1-B. It's in the next car. Please follow me. So, you're a musician, hm? Musician? And you're pretty insightful. Must be real interesting, all the songs and such. Yeah. It's amazing that I can keep them all straight in my head. Excuse me. Shot down? Bad luck, mate. I'm Angus Reilly. Bob Sterling, Alexis Oil. Oh, really? I'm in oil, too. Really? I'm always tinkering with me bikes. Keep 'em runnin' smooth. I hope they loaded me bike on good. It looks like they just threw it on. Got some pictures of my bike here. Wanna take a look? Not really. Bartender, bring my partner another drink here, would ya? You Limeys got a good sense of humor. Train 681 for Munich's now departing. Nice. Train 681, Train 681 you are now being tracked by the Railways Authority Board. Have a safe trip. The toughest border on the Eastern bloc. That's the first step. It's the hardest. Let's celebrate. I'm getting champagne. My job is to keep you alive. That means... That I'm under house arrest? In jail? You sound just like my son. And I feel very sorry for him. But you don't know where she is? I know she did some relief work in Bosnia for The WHO. They told me that she could be headed back for a spell. But you don't have a... phone number, an address or an email? No. Fax. I lost it, didn't I? They told me that she caught this very train 3 weeks ago. I mean I know it sounds cheesy but you could say that I'm following in me true love's footsteps. That is a beautiful story. Beautiful. Beautiful. Hey bartender, line 'em up here, two more right here please, would ya? Thank you. These are on me. In fact all the drinks tonight are on me. Conductor told me, he'd pick up my bar tab if I'd switch compartments. Sweet. Miss, can I put this up there? Oh, no, no, please, please. I saved for 10 years to buy this. Ok. Keep it right there. Thank you. All right, take care, partner. I'll see ya. It's the wrong time for this... right feeling again. It's like runnin' in a windstorm, just can't win. Looks like winter but it feels like spring. My mind says no... But my heart's just singin', it's the wrong time for the right feeling again. See it's the wrong time... Your attention please. Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich is now arriving on Track F. Your attention please. Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich is now arriving on Track F. Watch your step, miss. Let me help you with that, sir. Hey. Natasha. I'd appreciate if we weren't bothered. Thank you, sir. Unbelievable. It's the most beautiful little island I've ever seen. Safe passage. Thank you, Carl. Your attention, please. Hey, what do you want here? Engine's ours. I'm rolling. We're ready, Mason. You better be ready with the cell phone blocker, William. There we go. Take your positions. Be calm, be cool. You got it. Hello. Jacques. Yes. How's the compartment? Comfy. Fine. Now we're all set for Munich. William, you better be ready up there. Cell phone blocker's on. Over. Hello? Hello? Sure you don't wanna grab a drink? No. You're no fun, you know that? I don't have to be. I'm married. Really? I like married men. I bet you do. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Who is it? Ticket check. One moment please. I'm coming, I'm coming. Maddie. Happy Birthday. I can't believe you. I can't believe. Surprise. Surprise. Say something for the camera, Dad. We thought we'd surprise you. Here, here, open your present. Open it. Dad open it. Ethan! Ethan! This is my new client. New client? I'm Galina Konstantin. And what exactly do you do? I'm in acquisitions. Acquisition. Interesting. And you're helping my husband with what exactly? I'm... Maddie! Let me explain. Ok. Ok. Start by explaining how Vladimir ended up looking like that! Madeline, it's nothing. Ok. I'm overreacting. I find my husband alone with a prostitute at one AM. She's not a prostitute. It hurts that you acted like you were upset to leave us. I was upset. I still am. Don't. Don't. 20 years together and I never knew how good you were at lying, Jacques. Madeline, please listen to me. Please. I love you. That's the truth. I'm finding the kids and getting off the train at the next stop. Hey. Madeline. Oh, fuck. Stay put. Let me try to save my marriage. Be back in 5 minutes. I hope I didn't cause any problems. Lock the door. Hey, hey, hey! Where is she? Where is who? I don't know what you're talking about. She's not in 2C. She's booked into 2-C. Check again. Conductor swapped my room, partner. Hands up! This way! Move it! Move it! Wake up. Wake up! Wake up and look alive. Now! Come on! Move it! Move it! Everybody out! What I wanna know is what's going on. Who's that lady with Dad? Move! What are you doing? Take it easy. Just point the gun at me. Move it. Please, my kids are on this train. Let me find them. They're not in here. Lady, sit down or you'll never see your kids. Why don't we all try to calm down. Calm down. Galina. Oh shit. Move lady! She's not on the train, sir. No? Of course she is. Move the first class passengers into the bar car. I'll be there in a minute. Let's go! They're going to kill us all. Mom. Oh thank god. Thank god. They're my kids. They're my kids. Are you ok? Have you seen your father? He's not with you? Galina Konstantin. Mason's here? He can't wait to see you. I don't have anything. Go ahead. Keep them calm. Stop! What are you doing? I have to get off. No! Fuck you! I'm getting off! My family. Fuck you. I have to get to Munich. You'll kill yourself. Better than Mason Cole gets me. Mason Cole? He's here on this train. He finds me, I'm dead. Hey. Shit! Oh shit! Shit! Give that to me! What in the hell is this? None of your business. Don't! Some kind of drug? What is it? Don't. You'll infect all on the train. A biological weapon? They call it SP-43. It's a mutated strain of smallpox mixed in with several other pathogens. You can kill millions with this. Did Lars know? Of course. He's buying me a ticket to a new life. I'm finding my family and I'm keeping this. Give those to me. Lars owes me. He'll send you a check. Come on. Please be careful with that. French. Eighteen hundreds I'd say. No! Hello my fellow travelers. Sorry if you're uncomfortable but I've needed to relocate you to achieve a goal of mine. Now I'm not here to make any political or religious statement. As a matter of fact, I'm not here to make any statement at all. I'm looking for someone. A woman by the name of Galina Konstantin. Any of you men would remember her. She's quite striking. She was accompanied by a man, tall, dark hair. They're on this train. Perhaps one of you knows where. You, maybe. No? Please do not test my resolve. I'm going to ask you once again. Has anyone seen the people I've described? Well, if you don't know, you don't know, do you? Well if one of you has a sudden memory flash... please let me, or one of my associates, know. You've got 29 minutes. Sweep the train. Check the toilets, check the baggage car, pull up the goddamn carpets, but find them. Behind us! Stop shooting! Stop shooting! See you can't find good help these days. Hand them over. I don't have anything. Please don't insult my intelligence. Natasha. She doesn't have it. Check him. That's not it. That's more like it. Those are mine! Oh, no. Oh god. I'm dead. We're all dead. Oh no. Henry. Henry. It's ok. But I could die! You're not going to die. Trust me. We still have jobs to do and we're gonna do them. Since neither of you remembers science class, let me remind you that while this liquid is highly infectious, we can and are going to make an antidote, a vaccine. Why do you think it's so valuable? But we must proceed exactly as planned. If you don't I will kill you. Fritz. We have the package. Prepare for rendezvous. Copy that, sir. I'm 15 minutes out. Mason? I'm so sorry. Natasha, it's ok. I'll take care of you. Throw her off the train. And kill him. Get up Kristoff. Come on Mr. Kristoff. Come on, now. You tough, right? Come on, come on now. Show me what you got. Come on. If they get it, they'll leave us alone. We're witnesses. They'll kill us all. There's no way we can take 'em all on. They got guns bigger than I am. What're you going to do with me, Mason? I haven't decided yet. I could keep you around or scatter you over the tracks like Monsieur Kristoff. Are we gonna have a problem here? She's scared, that's all. Didn't your parents tell you it's impolite to stare? You're hurting me, Mason. Wouldn't want that, would I, Galina? No. No. Ethan. You thought you could do this job on your own? When I found you, you were only a cheap circus tart hustling the locals. I made you what you are. I know. I'm sorry. I messed up. I gave you everything. And this is how you repay me? Give me another chance. Please. Mason. We were good together. I'll make it up to you. I missed you. Here you go. You call me when we slow to 40 kilometers, ok? I need to go check the hydraulic lines. You got it. Please, please, don't kill me. I will do whatever you say. I'm not one of them. Hey, you're the conductor. Yes, sir. Vincent Gruber. Vincent. I need your help. Listen, I need to get to the engine to take control of this train. I can't make it up there, sir. My leg. But I can help. I know everything about this train. Ok, you've got it. Oh Vincent. Yes, sir? Call me Jacques. We are stopping. I'm getting out of here. Everybody sit down and be calm. Train 681, Train 681, you appear to be making an unscheduled stop. Are you having problems? Over. Hey. Vincent. We're losing speed. How to keep moving? I think I can tell you. You're burning up. I'll get you water. Mom, I'm fine. No. Where do you think you're going? I just need some water. For my kids. Can't you stop that? Cynthia? You all right? Pull the pressure off the brake lines. Got it. Find the fuel compressor. Is it empty or full? Empty. It's now time to start the engine by pressing the red button to your left. Careful! Give it too much and you'll rupture the brake lines. Yes? Lars, I'm carrying a bioweapon. Jacques, slow down, ok? We had to keep a low profile on this. Low profile? Mason Cole is on train! Mason? Jacques, where are you? In the engine to keep this train moving. Ok, good. Just keep working. You'll have backup in no time. You should know that... Hello? Hello? Something is really wrong. I hurt all over. We're screwed. Everybody's getting sick. Would you shut your mouth? You're not the only one who's scared here, pal. Have your head in the sand, Elton John, but I don't. Terrorists, plus sickness, equals biological warfare. Sir, I'm a doctor. I'll bet med school didn't prepare you for this. Or this. So what is it? Tell me what your professional opinion is, Doc. We're fucked. I can't help these people if you keep riling them up. Maybe we should all remain calm then? 'Cause pretty soon we're all gonna be knocking at the Pearly fuckin' Gates. Mason. Mason! You wanna strike out on your own? Fine. You're on your own. Bastard. Don't you leave me here. Don't leave me. Hard to say, isn't it? It's time. How you feeling? Getting ill? I hope your end is painful. Fuck you. You're already dead. Vincent. Vincent. We're stopping. Vincent. Listen baby, after we kill this fucker and get all the money, we're gonna buy our own island. You hear me? Our own island. Sir, two of them are on the way. Slam down the accelerator, the pressure... pump the fuel... prime the starter engine... careful! Give it too much... careful! Rupture the brake lines! Prime the starter engine. He's not here. Slam down the accelerator... rupture the brake line... careful! Stavros, tell me why we're moving. I don't know. It started on its own. Fritz, get back in the air and follow this train. You're pulling us out. That's affirmative, sir. Looks like the engine's leaking, Mason. Then fix it! She was the love of my life. Fritz. We're having problems down here. Pull us out. Copy that. I'm deploying the ladder. Damn it! There's too much blockage. It's no good, Mason! I'll get you on the other side of the mountain. Pull us out, now! No Mason. There's blockage. God damn it, do it! Get up on the roof. Get up to the roof! Fuck. Damn it. Just fucking die! Fuck. Fuck! Shit. She's got the vials. I'll take care of her. You make sure Kristoff is dead now. I don't want your word. I want his head! You need to lie down. Let me help you. What's wrong with us? Ok, that is it! You are out of here! You're a sicky and you're... I want you out. You. Move it. Come on, let's go. Why don't you just get a... You're a prince, you know that? You ok? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a cold. Since a week. I'm here to help you. Why don't you get her a glass of water. Yeah. Mom. Mommy. Mom. It hurts so bad. Oh baby. We need to pump liquids into them. Juice and water. Wet down all the bar towels and anything else you can find to make cold compresses. All right. You got it. General Zakev? Jacques Kristoff. Jacques, how is the vacation? I'm on Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich. We've been hijacked... by Mason Cole. Any idea why? 3 vials of SP43. We've had reports that it was stolen from the Slovakian government. Consider it confirmed. It's on this train. Did you contact Lars? Yeah. There has been exposure. My god. Do you have the vials? I'm doing everything I can to get them. Unless you recover it, stop that train. I know the procedure, sir. Jacques! We've got to clear the tracks, now. Then call the WHO. Lorenzo! He's up here! Kill him! Kill him! No fuckin' way! Are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. Do you know what's going on around here? I'm not sure. Everyone who's sick had to be exposed at the same time but... nothing has an incubation period this short. I think it might be smallpox. Smallpox? But wasn't that wiped out? Yeah, it was eradicated back in 1973. Kristoff's dead. You're sure this time? Yeah. I saw him fly off the top of the train on a motorcycle. No way he could have survived. You better be right. And Galina? No sign. I need those vials, Henry. Well at this rate I'll be down to me knickers soon. It's just wrong that the young ones have to suffer. I can cover myself up if you want. No, that's it. Most countries stopped inoculating against smallpox in 1979. We've had our shots. So our immune systems still have a trace of the vaccine. But anyone born after that has absolutely no protection. So what you're saying is that we're safe. We can't get it. No, we can. It'll just be delayed or not as strong. Mom. Mom, get over here. Cool her down. I need some room! Give me some room. Good girl. It's ok. No! Get ice! If we don't get this fever down... Bob, you need to go help that lady. I can't go over there. I'm afraid. We're all afraid. Oh come on. Angus, please, bring the ice. More, more. It's ok. It's ok. Come on baby. No, no... Train 420, this is an emergency. Come in. Reiner. Reiner. Come in. What? You must stop your train at Linz. What's going on? Mom? Your fever's broken. Angus, please. No problem. Pull her out. Look out! Let me have some medical supplies. You're responsible for this... Don't waste bullets on dead people. Mommy? Passports. Yours and the brats'. Now! Jacques? I've got to stop this train. The engine's on fire. Can you shut it? I'll try. If you can't, get out of there! Happy Birthday, Jacques. I've had my initial consultation with the firm of Kristoff... Kristoff and Kristoff. So here's the deal. You've got 2 minutes to get to Compartment 5-B. And Jacques, I don't like killing women and kids, but I will if I have to. Don't come any closer. Or I'll shoot you. I swear to god, I'll shoot you. You've got the vials. Don't fucking move or I'll kill you! You're sick. If you had let me go, everything would be ok. I would be fine. Listen. With the vials we can cure you and everybody else. It's too late. No it's not. You've got to trust me. Kristoff. Ok? 30 seconds. Ok. I'm gonna make things right. Otto, what's going on? That drunken moron hasn't stopped! Reiner. Stop the train! There's no way to avoid a collision. Just a few seconds to go. 3, 2... 1. Jacques. Dad! Let's put that weapon down, Jacques. Drop the clip. Let him go. I've got a proposition for you. As you pretty much decimated my entire crew, I need someone to go find Galina and those vials. That someone is you. Fail and I'll shoot your whole family. And just to let you know I mean business, I think I'll shoot the boy right now. Wait. I've got it. I've got it. I don't believe you. Let Ethan go. Give it to me first. I must say, you made for a rather challenging journey. Why are you doing this? I like long vacations. Say your prayers. What about our deal? Our deal! Get the boy! Fucking Ethan. Fucking kid. Reiner. Reiner, come in! Fuckin'? You must stop! No! Easy. Easy. Careful. It must've hit the tail of the train. Ethan? Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Eth... Oh, oh my god, you're hurt. It's fine. Leave it. No. No. Leave it! No! No! No, Jacques! I'm fine. 20 years you've lived a different life. Our son is dead. And our daughter... I'm sorry. I have to go. They need my help. They need my help, too. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you so much. The train is only 50 miles from Munich. My orders are to be prepared for the worst. Are the troops in place? Yes, sir. If they reach the bridge at Charles, we have a squadron of Apache gunships in place loaded with thermal chemical bombs. Those bombs carry enough heat to destroy the virus. Dr. Reno? It's our only choice. If this virus gets out millions will die. Vincent. We must stop this train. They will. They have to. But the engine... We don't need it. Let's disconnect it. Come on. Come on, I will show you. Your husband's a good man. How long have you worked with him? Since last night. No. Your husband's a loyal man. Pull the handle. Handle. That's enough. Once we get disconnected we'll have to use the handbrake. Jacques! Help me. Help me here! The brakes! Use the brakes. Take the handle. Any word from Kristoff? No, sir. Get me NATO Command Center. I can't give him any more time. Take your positions. Over. On my signal. Push. Push. It's going. Detonate the bridge. Yeah! Yeah! Yes! The car. Let's all take this slow. Easy now. Ethan? Ethan. Kept this for you, Dad. Ethan. Get out! Attention all passengers. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. As you can see, the train is being tented. Once tenting is completed, you will be disembarked in an orderly fashion. We are establishing a quarantine area by the side of the tracks where you will receive medical attention. We appreciate your patience and your cooperation. Attention all passengers. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. As you can see, the train is being tented. Once tenting is completed, you will be disembarked in an orderly fashion. We are establishing... Ethan. You were so brave. I'm proud of you. I love you. Thanks Dad. Excuse me please. Thank you. It's gonna be ok, sweetheart. I know. She's right. Everything will be fine, baby. Ok? I promise. Ok? Dr. Reno. Dr. Madeline Kristoff. They all had high fevers, so monitor their temperatures. Get them on I.V. Fluids. It will be done. Do you know if any of the virus had been recovered? 2 vials of live virus. More than enough to cure everybody affected. Listen. You get better now, you hear? Soon as you're out of the hospital I'm gonna buy you a new fiddle. It was a violin. Sir, I'm going to need some room. You're going to be fine. Shot down again, mate. I don't think so. Listen, I'm sorry. I was behaving badly back there and I... It's ok, mate. Thanks. Maybe when we get out of here I'll buy you a drink. Oh. A drink for me and my lady friend. What? Didn't I tell you? She works for the World Health Organization. Don't you, Petra? Angus? Jacques. General Zakev. Thank god you made it. Lars. You came here quickly. You're alive. The virus, you have it? Yes I do. I just have one question. How much you gonna get for the virus? What are you talkin' about? You're still a little disoriented. No, I'm thinking clearly. Mason's plan was impossible without inside information. Mason Cole is a topnotch criminal. It's more than that. You told us to get on Train 681. There was no other out. There's always. What was with Galina? You were on a needto-know basis. It is not the first time this happened. This is the first time you've caught on. Then explain to me how Mason knew which compartment you booked us in? You're delusional, you know? Delusion this. Zakev, arrest this man. With pleasure, Jacques. Soldiers, take him away. Some birthday, Jacques? Do I have to tell you how much I love you? No. Let's go see the kids. Where's Galina? Oh, I'm sure she'll turn up somewhere.
