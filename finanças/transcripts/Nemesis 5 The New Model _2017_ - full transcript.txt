[beeping] [rumbling] [upbeat electronic music] [wind whistling] [eerie electronic music] [eerie humming] [chaotic electronic beeping] [door creaking] [guns firing] [gun clicking] [Alex gasps] [grunting] [computerized groaning] - [Ari] It was 12 years ago, the day I met Alex. I couldn't believe it. My parents had been killed as a result of the 60-Year Cyberwar, and I'd been by myself for a few months. I had almost given up hope when I found that alley, and when I found the war goddess. My whole life changed at that moment. Alex wasn't very interested in my company at first, but my persistence finally paid off. I must have asked her a thousand questions that day. She maybe answered three of 'em. She took me to where she lived. It was a very secluded place in the wastelands, a place where no one would ever bother her. As time went on, she would open up to me. She even started to train me. [crossbow snapping] [arrow thudding] [crossbow snapping] [arrow thudding] Alex told me of the cyborg war between the Red Army Hammerheads and the LA Police, how both sides claimed to be protectors of the humans, but due to all the death and destruction, the humans no longer cared. She showed me a journal that she had been writing in. It documented all that she had been through, fights, friends, enemies, time lapsing, everything. Alex told me how at one point in 2084, the war was about to be over, how the LA Police had been making significant victories against the Red Army Hammerheads and that an end to the wars was in sight, and that's when the Hammerheads tried a new tactic. That had launched a massive coordinated attack on the four major national media centers. The Hammerheads' non-stop propaganda made them out to be the saviors of humanity against what they called the fascist LA police state. Videos of state atrocities committed by the Hammerheads were made to look like the LA Police flooded the airwaves. So willing to believe what they saw on the screen, the humans had taken the Red Army Hammerheads' side. [gun firing] The army-held media fed human's act. They would be totally submissive within a generation. She thought she had failed humanity, but could fix that by training and teaching me. Over time, as I got stronger, Alex would get weaker as her cybernetic parts would break down, but her emotional strength would get stronger. We knew the only way to do this was send me back to 2077 LA, seven years before the national media takeover. The Hammerheads had a stronghold on the media there at that time. I would go back to find their leaders and put an end to the propaganda machine. Alex felt that this was the right thing to do, because now she can hear the angels singing for her at the end of her existence. [machine humming] [chaotic synthesizer music] [computer beeping] - [Man] I have the subject on the phone. What do you advise? - [Man] Go in. Go in. [dramatic music] [gasps] - Move and I'll crush your throat. [tense electronic music] Hmm. Had to make sure you weren't armed. Can't be too careful these days. Undercover police are everywhere. Relax baby. [laser gun humming] [gun firing] [upbeat electronic music] [sighs] - Goddamn bitch cop. - Goddamn terrorist! [gun firing] [upbeat electronic rock music] [singing in foreign language] [tense electronic music] [electronic warbling] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [dramatic music] [guns firing] [dramatic music] [guns firing] [laughing] [guns firing] - She got away. - Not for long. Get a drink and mourn the martyrs. [static crackling] [alarm blaring] - Good evening. Firstly, all of us here with the Red Army Hammerheads would like to thank you for your help in decimating the oppressive power of the fascist Los Angeles Police. Without you, the strides we have made would never have been possible. Unfortunately, the battle continues and we still need your help. The LAPD continues to recruit others against you. This was the scene earlier where a member of your Red Army Hammerheads, as well as three fully human citizens, were viciously killed by this woman. If you have any information as to her identity or whereabouts, please find any of your Red Army Hammerhead officers, so they may apprehend this terrorist against you and give you the recognition and thanks you deserve for not only helping your Red Army Hammerheads, but also your family and your country. Remember, see something, say something. We can't do this without you. Goodnight. - John Walker is very good. - Yes. Excellent. Calls are coming in already. - Who is she? - [Man In Glasses] No ID on her yet. [dramatic music] - Come on, we gotta go. - What's the rush? - I got free of the ambush by the building! - You are all over the news! They have footage! - [Ari] Oh, that was fun. - Who was it? - I don't know, some guy in a trenchcoat and two white-haired twin girls. - Shit, Harley and her twin. They've each been modified in the right eye. It's got a camera. It goes straight to the network. You got it? - Yes. - Good, Eve should be able to do something with this. [knocking] It's Ari. - Alright, clear! - We're all clear. - So, you got a bit popular all of a sudden. - So I've heard. - Harley and the twins were there. - Well, they do like to watch. - Nice. - How much time do you think we have? - Not much. - Yes. - They're at a building on 12th and Ed Street. Time to redeem yourself, no human martyrs this time. - Yes sir. Let's go. [tense music] - Do you guys have it? - Here it is. - Thank you. - Well, knowing that Diane was a close contact to Mel, her card probably has his location in the wasteland somewhere on the memory. Once we got that, we can go meet my contact for transportation into the wasteland and be out of your hair forever. - Good, I can't wait to get you guys out of here. I mean, I'm all for the cause and everything, but not for the price of my head or my building. - Alright, here we go. Last several weeks, preset locations, there's even a spot here in the wastelands. - Are you sure it's not an outpost? - Uh, I don't think so. It's further out than most of he outposts. - I'm game. - It's a bit of a ride out there. I can study the rest of the disk on the way there. - Good, let's start packing. - About fucking time. - [Adrian] They're here! - Fucking hell! - How many? - So far I see the twins. - No Harley? - No, he's probably coming in on the other side. - Oh fuck, oh fuck! - Calm the fuck down! If you don't calm the fuck down, I'm gonna shoot your right in the head. [dramatic music] - I can't, I'm sorry. - No, don't! [guns firing] - Aim for their eyes! Shoot out their cameras. [guns firing] - [groaning] Fuck! [guns firing] - How bad is it? - It hurts like hell, but I will be fine. [electricity crackling] - Jesus! [computer buzzing] - Hey sure, you think you can hack these? - Um, what are we looking for? - If they're constantly recording, then maybe we can get some actual footage of them killing humans. - I probably can. It'd be nice to finally get some truth out there. - Yeah. - Ari, get the door. How long till we meet your transportation contact? - About four hours. - That is a long time. - Then we got a long walk. - Good times. [dramatic music] - It appears that Harley Stone and he twins were destroyed. - That is is unfortunate. Were they able to upload? - No, their eyes were removed. - Impressive foresight on their part. - There was one martyr. - Mm. He never was very good at taking direct orders. Let's have a camera crew out there to capture footage, have John Walker spin this the way that he can. - I'll have a strike team assembled to strike and find them. - No. - Reasons? - I'm more interested in their mission now. I believe Diane A was targeted. Have we heard from the Turncoat? - No, it appears he was destroyed as well. - That's too bad. He was a bit twitchy. It's hard trying to be human and be one of us. The next appearance of her on camera, let's send in a drone, try to find them. - Yes, maybe intel can get in and piece together just enough information to find out what their mission is and who she is. - Who are you? [eerie electronic music] - Okay. Dill, Dill, Dill! - Why are you here? - We're here to see Dill. - State your purpose! - Transportation. - To where. - Out of the city into the wasteland. - You got payment for that? - We'd like to see the transportation first. - Alright, let's go. - It appears they plan on leaving town. They're in a garage, section eight, at the edge. - There's no way I can get strike team there in time. - We could at least send in a drone. Make it a little bit more difficult for them. - Yes, I do not want their escape to be without incident. - Right this way. SO here it is. - [Eve] It's not a toy, guys. - Yeah, what do you think? - We'll work it out, it's fine. - That's what I thought. [dramatic music] [guns firing] [lasers buzzing] [gun firing] Hey, I think you're gonna need this. This has maps to the outposts, and everything you're gonna need. - Thanks. - Good luck. [door humming] [engine revving] - [Blonde Woman] It appears that they have escaped into the wasteland, thoughts? - Send out word to the outposts. The outposts are not to engage in hostilities, but are to treat them as they would any other paying customer. They'll be rewarded for the information ♪ Time flies [ethereal music] ♪ Time flies ♪ Lying inside my time machine ♪ Let me take you on a ride ♪ Should we go into the future ♪ Or go into the past ♪ Should we take it slow ♪ Or go real fast ♪ You have got some choice to make ♪ ♪ I know you want it bad ♪ It's the timing of our lifetime ♪ ♪ I know you won't forget ♪ My time machine ♪ My time machine ♪ Time flies ♪ Time flies ♪ A millions years pass us by ♪ Take a closer look into the hands of time ♪ ♪ Time goes by and moves so fast ♪ ♪ And we want to make it last ♪ And time has gone by so fast ♪ And the last is in the past ♪ So take your time ♪ To fly [upbeat electronic music] [eerie music] [wind whistling] - Let's see, according to this, that outpost is called The Zoo. It leans more Hammerhead, but cares more about being paid. - What do you think? - It's the only one on our way. - The next house is about three miles out. - Well, it looks like that's our only option. - It would be kind of nice for Eve and I to get a little patched up. - Yeah. - Alright, well, stay sharp down there. - And get your fuck ass outta here and don't come back! [gun firing] Hi! I'm Jason. Welcome to the Zoo Bar! Nobody knows your name here, and nobody cares. All are welcome. Just don't pull any shit or you'll end up like that dead fucker outside. - My kind of place. - You look wounded! Aww! That's okay, we got a good nurse. She's very clean and sterile. - That would be kind of nice. - Mm-hm, well, fill out a supply request form at the bar and we'll get you set up while you enjoy yourselves. - Nice. - Stay frosty in here. [upbeat dance music] - This is Jamie, your host. - Welcome! - I already gave 'em the lay of the land. They've got two wounded. - Thank you. - Oh, you're very welcome. - Again, welcome. - Great place. - We try to have a little civility in an uncivilized part of the of the world. We have everything you could want here. We have food, drink, sex, supplies, speed loads, et cetera. Nurse's station right this way. I'm only trying to help her. - I'm sorry, it's been a really long couple of days. It'll be okay. - Relax, I will be with her the entire time. - Fine, but we're only here to get supplies and to get patched up. Only Dan. - I completely understand. Most people that come here have had really long days themselves. May I? He'll help you with the supply cubes. - Shit. You could just fucking relax. I mean, you gotta remember, we're fighting for an actual life here. - Yeah, I'll start living when the mission is over. - Well, that'll be a start. - Need a supply sheet? - Yes. - Got a beer? Cold? It has been a long time. - Y'all better get out sooner. - Tastes like life. - Yes sir, everything will be added to your supply bill. - You want one? - No. - Thank you. You know, you really gotta take a moment of life and freedom when the opportunity arises. Well, it looks like you got the supplies under control. I'm gonna go up and catch a show. Be back when I need a couple more beers. We'll get started on this right away. [dramatic electronic music] [arrow thudding] [upbeat dance music] - Your friend is right. - About what? - Taking a moment of life when you can. - I can't. - Your friends can. See? It's not that hard. - Ha, she's smiling! - So what's a pretty girl like you doing in a classy joint like this? - Really? Cheesy pickup lines? - What can I say? I'm romantic. I just figured a pickup line would be better than just coming out and asking if you'd come back to my office. - Oh, are you the nurse? - Ha. Michelle down there, she's the nurse. I'm the owner of this little slice of heaven. Don't worry, don't worry, all are welcome here. In the wasteland, none of us have time for war. - On any other day I might actually take you up on that offer. - Really? - It's been a while since the last time I had brains fucked out. [chokes] If everything goes well, maybe I'll be back. Cheers. [glasses clinking] Thanks for the drink.

I'd don't think they'd be so extreme, especially not with one of their toys resting down below. - What if they decide to turn their toy on. - You entertain them. I'll call the Hammerheads. - Wise decision on your part. - Entertain only. - Yes sir. [upbeat dance music] Who's ready for some extra fun? - Oh...

[upbeat dance music] - Excellent news to hear. Remember, do not engage in hostilities, and you will be rewarded. We'll have a task force out there within the hour. - Where are they? - A detestable place called the Zoo. - Hey.

[groaning] Looks like you're due for an upgrade. Am I really that big of a bitch? - So what am I dealing with here? Human or borg? - All human down here, baby. - Hmm, very nice.

[glass breaking] [guns firing] [intense rock music] [bodies squelching] - To Dan! - Dan. - Dan. You guys were pretty close, weren't you? - We've been fighting this war for the past five years. - I always knew this day would come. - Fighting a war with friends, you tend to fight a little harder. - You tend to fight a little harder. - Maybe I will have another drink. - For moments of life and freedom. - Let's go. [electronic beeping] - [Man With Glasses] I didn't expect to hear from you again. - Yeah, things didn't go exactly as planned. - Oh, that is most unfortunate I'll have to call off the task force. Try something different. - So, they got away? - Yes. - Mm, the Zoo does house a nebula, does it not? - I believe it does. - Mm, well I will contact Mel about possibly letting it loose. - I should get in touch with him. - The media office is asking for the nebula to be released from the Zoo. - It'll be a good test for her. - She doesn't need a test! She's just another human that needs to be dealt with! [electronic beeping] [computer clicking] [computer screeching] [computer clanking] [humming] [dramatic music] - Oh shit! [screaming] Fuck, whoa! [groaning] [screaming] - Fuck you! I don't need this Hammerhead shit! [computer clanking] [eerie synthesizer warbling] [beeping] [clanking] [beeping] [wind whistling] [clanking] [engine rumbling] - What the hell? Those fuckers were shorting us on fuel! - [sighs] Well, it looks like we have about 30 miles to go. Alright, take what you can. [clicking] [synthesizer warbling] - Ari, can I ask you something? - Yeah? - How human are you? - What do you mean? - Just what I asked. How human are you? Most cyborgs show very little emotion. I know they started off as human. Some either by their own free will or by force were modified with cybernetics. They still have wants and needs, but they seem to be motivated. - Primary goal is what it seems. Seems like there's no soul behind these emotions or wants and needs. [dramatic music] - There's an old saying that a person I looked up to as a mother used to say, that 86.5% was still considered human, but I don't know if I ever really believed that. As a child, I remember her trying to be nurturing and caring, but those emotions were foreign to her. And I know that's the way that she was being raised. She was designed in a lab to be a genetically superior human. She was trying to save the world, and she was trained as a warrior, and she excelled at that. Throughout her life, it was hard for her. She lost her birth mother as an infant, and she lost her adopted family when she was in her early childhood. And people disrespected her because of her appearance, but she was the most physically fit and muscular person I have ever seen. They used to call her a war goddess, but the way that people treated her, she wanted to be better, so she got cybernetic implants, and her whole body became a hunter herself. And that's when she lost most of her humanity. All she ever knew was to be a warrior, and she trained me as such. But then one day, when the cybernetic parts failed, I got to see that true emotion. And on and on, as more of the cybernetic parts failed, more of that true emotion came out. She used to call me the new model. She wanted the new model to fully human, and she never wanted me to be cybernetically engineered or implanted or anything. So, as a warrior and a hunter, I keep my emotions in check. So, to answer your question, I am fully human. I'm just really good at fighting and killing. - Who was she? - Alex Sinclair. - Hmm, you know her? What is it? [energy humming] - It's one of Mel's nebulas. Brace yourself! [upbeat electronic music] [guns firing] [fists thudding] [gun firing] [groaning] - Daughter of Alex Sinclair. - You know who I am? - He knows. - Who? [gun firing] [synthesizer warbling] - Goodbye Adrian. - Let's go. [eerie electronic humming] - It appears that she has defeated the nebula. - Hmm, very impressive. - I've defeated one of your nebulas. - Yes, yes you have. - I believe that she had two accomplices with her at the time. - I understand the point you're trying to make, Barbarella. - Do you? - We should get ready for our guests. - [sighs] Guests! I believe that you are only interested in the one. Any others can and will be discarded. - I don't see any guards down there. Probably lurking inside. - You know, for such an important individual, there's really not a whole lot of security. Here, take this. Good luck. - Thanks. [dramatic music] [gun firing] [groaning] - Weak human. [sighs] Didn't even hear me coming. [sighs] Okay. Let's see what Little Miss Save the World is doing. [upbeat electronic music] [eerie electronic music] - Freeze! Don't fucking move! [dramatic music] [groaning] - Do you like it? It's lavender. I was always a big fan of flower aromatics. So? - So what? - So do you like it? - It smells nice. - Thank you. It's so nice of you to say that. I was able to grow that here. Most of the people that I interact with can't appreciate even the simplest things in life. Like the scent of a flower. - My sister Barbie here is not able to enjoy the scent. She can detect that there is a scent, tell you what it is, but if you were to ask her to describe it, she's unable to do it because of the cybernetics. Barbie cannot tell me it smells nice, how my tea tastes. Or even how pretty you are. Does this at all sound familiar to you? - How do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean. Your own childhood. The relationship you had with your, uh... Uh, let's just say adopted mother during your childhood. - How do you know? - I know who you are, Ari. And I know who Alex Sinclair is. Take a sip, I think you'll like it. Well? - Tastes nice. - Come on, you can give me a better answer than that. - I both smell and taste it. I smell the scent of a flower and the taste of a wood. It makes me feel calm and at peace. - [Mel] Thank you. I've been waiting for an answer like that for a long time. I've been searching for an answer like that forever. I've been searching for an equal, someone lie you, to join me here. - Why me? - [Mel] Because of Alex. - How do you know Alex? - I heard stories about a perfectly... Unique human woman, a woman who as a warrior and could rattle any man or cyborg. I had given up one of my nebulas to find her. And when I discovered that she had defeated it I was even more interested in her. Oh, by the way, I commend you for defeating the one earlier today. I time lapsed around myself to find her. Which I did. At first I observed from afar, and one day I approached her and talked to her. [laughs] At that time she was fully human and beautiful. Since she had already left the tribal upbringing, she wasn't corrupted from the cyber technologies. She was a goddess. Unfortunately, society was not kind to her. She was... She was mocked continually. After a while, she felt imperfect, just like my sister did. She felt she needed upgraded. They just... First, I loved her. And it broke my heart to see her lose her humanity like my sister did. [sighs] She became... Nothing but a coldblooded killer for hire. I lost interest in her and society for what they had done. Soon I began to set in motion me to lead the Red Army, to take over. I would use the media and propaganda to change society itself. I knew how much people hated us, 50 year war. That's how we're gonna change it. This war was caused and fought by cybernetics. I knew that I could... that I could sway the full humans with the media. It didn't matter, no... For which way. Humans would rise up against anyone who would come against them. That's why I chose the Red Army's side. - What about all the people that fought and died for your cause? [sighs] - So weak! - I call them martyrs for the better good. If society comes back together, their deaths will not be in vain. - Well you did misjudge one thing. - What was that? - Alex. You should've kept coming back to visit her. Because while in my early childhood that might've been true, she did change. - How so? - Her cybernetic parts started to fail. And she never upgraded. With every part that would start to fail, I'd get to see that real, true emotion, and most of her humanity had come back. She became more human and more emotional. - Obsolete and broken! - Barbie! - No, I don't wanna hear any more of this! You feel like your life is imperfect because I cannot taste your tea or smell your stupid flowers? [sighs] I am exactly who I am supposed to be! I am better and stronger than Alex ever was. And I'm stronger and more advanced than you! [breathes deeply] I always hated your obsession for Alex! You talk about time lapsing back to see her? You talk about her every chance that you've had. - Barbie! - And your obsession with her! - [Mel] Please! - It's what I myself feel imperfect! [sobs] - No, no no no. - You did this to me! [dramatic music] But [sobs] what's amusing is how easy it was to get Alex to upgrade. - What, what? - You think you're the only one who can time lapse? I went back once and I found her. I was just being on the side of the lake pretty. I showed her a few of my simple upgrades. Alex was very interested. It was like planting a seed and watching a tree grow over the span of time. That sounds like something you would say, doesn't it. [laughs] She became like an addict to becoming more perfect herself. - Barbie, help me. [heart throbbing loudly] - Look at this weak, sick human. This will never happen to me, because I've been upgraded enough so that I will always remain strong. So? How do your flowers smell now? [heart beating slowly] I don't deny that you have some skills. Join with me and get the upgrades that you need, and become as powerful as I am. [Mel groans] - Sorry Barbie, but I like myself the way that I am. - So be it! [grunting] [dramatic electronic music] [grunting] - John Walker, you'll be going on in just one minute. - You're right about one thing. Society will change. But it'll be done with truth and free will. - Hey, you can't come in here! [gun firing] [electricity crackling] [electronic beeping] [computer whirring] - Firstly, all of us here with your Red Army Hammerheads would like to thank you for your help in decimating the oppressive power of the fascist Los Angeles Police. Without you, the strides we have made would never have been possible. Unfortunately, the battle continues and we still need your help. The LAPD continues to recruit others against. The fascist Los Angeles Police have been making a tax on the civilian population again. Our director has this to say. - [Recording Of Man With Glasses] Have John Walker spin this the way that he can. - Uh... Uh... Uh... Matt? - [Ari] That's how the fall of the Red Army Hammerheads began. The people rose up, not believing the lies anymore. They took back control of their own lives. The cybernetics business even took a hit as people learned of the fuller lives that they can lead just by being human.
