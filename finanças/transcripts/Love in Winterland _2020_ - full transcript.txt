RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Next week on "Happily Ever After", we're down to the final two. Tanner Dylan, international man of many hats, has a decision to make... who will be the one to join him on the Final Date Week, and will she prove to be his "Happily Ever After"? Ally, you've almost made it to the final date. This is huge! I can't even believe I got this far. Is Tanner Dylan the type of guy you can fall in love with? Well, nobody actually goes on TV to fall in love. That's not why I signed up. We know that. I signed up to promote the hotel, which is what we should be doing right now. Admit it. You like Tanner. I mean, he checks off a lot of boxes. How many boxes? All of them. Every single box. So you do like him. Maybe a little? But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm probably gonna be going home next week, and that will be the end of my merry little adventure into spectacle dating. So can we please get back to work? Okay, okay. Thank you. So unromantic. You missed a spot. And over there, too. There's an extra shovel if you wanna back me up a bit. You couldn't pay me enough. And you don't. Hey, I could use some help in the kitchen. When are you gonna get a snow blower? I've been telling him that for years. Guys, guys, snow blowers are over-rated. All right? Okay, well, you missed a spot. So I wanted to kick off our winter campaign with a "style the snowman" for the kids, outside... it's a big hit with families. And then inside, I wanted tones of gold and white, and all things that felt very fresh... still appropriate for California, but definitely brings you back to Christmas. And our White Hot Chocolate Bar has been a huge hit. So, in sum, "Park Swan Hotels... You do you... and leave the rest to us". Nicely done. No one sells winter quite like you can. Thank you, Trish. You know who you remind me of? Well, I'm hoping you. Some would say that's not a compliment, but yes. Now... let's talk about "Happily Ever After". Any idea where you'll be going for your Final Date Week? I haven't been chosen. You will be. I can feel it. Trish, I just... I want to make sure that no matter what happens with the show, my position here won't be affected. Don't worry. Rosie will oversee all your projects when you're away. If I'm away. When you're away. Listen, this whole experience has been a real boon for all of us. Swan Hotels gets free publicity, and you get to date a wonderful man. Win-win. Hi, Mom! Hi, sweetie. We saw the promo. We're so excited! And you looked adorable. You're in the final two. Yeah, which means there's a 50/50 chance that I can go home. Hey, look who came by to help your father. Did you want to talk? No, thank you. I'm okay. Come on. You broke up years ago. You don't have to spend the rest of your lives avoiding each other. Now... talk! Talk! Hi, Alice. Please don't call me that. Congratulations on reaching the Final Two. You're watching? No. Everyone else in town is. So it's come to this? A dating show? Says the guy eating cupcakes with my parents on a Friday night. You're missing out! Pretty darn good. And by the way, the night is young. Is it? Because it's 10 p.m., so I think there, that means the night's over. You've been gone too long. We've stepped it up around here. 10:30 on weekends. Better get to it, then. Okay. Lotsa luck on your TV date. You guys are so cute together. Mom. I know. I just want my baby girl to be happy. Right, dear? Hi, sweetie! So what's with this Tanner fella? It doesn't even look real. Probably because it will disappear after tonight, along with me. I disagree. I think it's gonna be Ally and Tanner all the way. Hi! Welcome back, Ally. - Thank you. - You ready for a big night? Yeah, I guess so. Great. Let's do this. Good luck. - Hey. - Hey. Now, remember... this isn't a contest. It isn't? We prefer the word "journey". I have a good feeling about you and Tanner. Do you say that to all the girls? Yes. Great. Any last questions? Actually, yes. Why do so many people cry on this show? It's, like, three dates. A lot can happen in a few dates. Some people fall in love in a moment, others take longer. Love's funny that way. All right. Your mic is good. Perfect. We'll see you out there. Okay. Welcome to another journey for love, where tonight, Tanner Dylan will choose who will be by his side for the romantic Final Date Week, and together, they'll see if they can find their "Happily Ever After". And here we are. Hi! Again. Indeed. So, how was your week since last we chatted? It was great. I... I got a lot of work done. Marketing's kind of a non-stop job, especially for a company like Swan Hotels. You know, we have locations in Santa Monica, Santa Barbara, and San Diego, that are excellent destinations for people looking to go on a journey. The, cameras aren't rolling at the moment. Sorry. No, it's okay, I get it. What did you do? I don't know, I've been, fairly busy with this television program called "Happily Ever After". I don't know if you've heard of it? I have heard of it. Okay, good. So... have you found your "Happily Ever After"? I think I could be getting closer. But I must admit, it's tricky, isn't it? We've had, what? Six dates? I feel like we've barely scratched the surface getting to know each other. What do you want to know? Absolutely everything. Okay. Some people... think that I can be competitive. That can be healthy, when properly applied. Yes! Thank you! That's what I think. What else? I've lived in a studio apartment in West Hollywood for over a year and haven't fully unpacked. Because you're always working. Yes. I eat takeout, mostly, because I'm a horrible cook, and I have an impressively long list of allergies to plants and trees, and... my last serious relationship was in high school. Because you're always working. Yeah. Well, then, it seems to me that the only way to get to know the real Ally Wilson... is to get her away from work. All right! Is the game on? What are we watching? Looks like your ex-girlfriend. Real funny. This has been the hardest decision I've had to make, but I think I would like to spend my final week with... ...Ally. Me? Yes. Are you sure? I'm quite sure. Ally and Tanner... get ready for romance, because you two will be spending the week of your final date in Ally's hometown of Winterland, Vermont. Yay! She's coming home! What was that? We're going to Winterland? You sure are! What could be more romantic and perfect than spending winter in Winterland? I think I'm gonna cry. How do you feel about going home? I'm still a bit dazed, to be honest. And kind of nervous. I mean, the town I grew up in is so small that even if you don't know what you're doing, somebody else will. Day and night, night and day. And you're excited to be reunited with Tanner? "Reunited" is a bit dramatic, but... But you're thinking about him. I mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things. Snow... snowmobiling, snowshoeing, snow-shoveling, snowed in, snowed out... what are my parents gonna say on national television? Am I gonna have to go into hiding forever? - Mom! - You're home! Hi! This is Lauren. Lauren, this is my mom, Molly. Oh, Lauren. It's so nice to meet you in person finally. You too! Your house is gonna be so beautiful for the show. What's happening here? Your mom has been so helpful. Where's Dad? In the basement. He'll be up in a sec. Lauren, I'll be honest. Tom's a little concerned about all the cameras hidden around the house. That is perfectly natural. You know what? Here is a list of all the places that we've discreetly placed cameras so we can capture the important moments without getting in the way, and these are the "no camera" zones. Gotcha. Thank you. Are you sure you're okay with this? Of course. And... as a token of our appreciation for bringing our girl home... Thank you, Molly. It's beautiful. Is this sweater from your store? Handmade for you. She makes everything. She once knit a shower curtain. I did! And Tom has a ski shop, right? Yes. 30 years now. But when they met, he was a stockbroker in New York, and he gave it all up to come here... from Wall Street to Main Street. And this is the street we like. That's beautiful. Why don't I show you the room Ally grew up in? I would love to. I don't know that we need to do that. - Yes, please. - No. I think... okay. You know, nothing makes for better TV than a close-knit family. Kinda nice in real life too. 'Course, we'd be closer if Ally lived closer. Mom, we FaceTime every day. Face-to-face time is better than FaceTime anytime. Well, just to be clear, my parents visit me all the time in L.A. Yes, she puts us up at her hotel, but we'd rather stay at her apartment. My apartment doesn't have a spare bedroom or room service. Well, as you can see, we left a few of her things up. These are her trophies from the Annual Chili Cook-Off. I thought you didn't cook. I don't cook, but chili is not cooking... it is art. She's very serious about her chili. Clearly! First place three years in a row, no big deal. And very competitive, our Ally. Well, maybe you'll have a chance to win again with Tanner. So we have five scheduled dates planned, ending with the Festival of Lights and a romantic dinner, where Tanner and Ally will decide if their journey continues. And do all of these locations have "discreet" cameras as well? Yes, which is why it's important to stick to the pre-determined locations. And our editor, Sandra, is the best in the business. What's this? That is... something that should've been thrown out a long time ago. They're lovely memories. Well, that was fun. Dad! Hi! I thought I heard your voice. Lauren, this is my Dad. Tom, Lauren. Lauren, very nice to meet you. - You too. - Welcome. Thank you. And this is Brett Hollister. - So great to put a face to the name. - Pleasure. Hello, Al. What are you doing here? I was just helping Tom here put in a water heater. We're putting in a tankless. Okay. So I've got you and Ally checking in at the inn... I've got you in for a late check-in. Figured you'd want to hang out with your folks. No. I'm staying here. Honey... didn't Lauren tell you? Yeah, we booked the Winterlight Inn for the cast and crew. Your mother got us a great deal. What are you doing? You love the inn. She worked there during high school. Great! Well, you'll be right across the hall from Tanner, in the "Snowbird Suite". You know, Ally actually named it the Snowbird Suite. Really? Perfect. Well, Brett, thank you so much for everything. You've been so accommodating. Easy. And that's Brett for you. Nothing he wouldn't do for Ally. I could think of a few things. And you know what, Lauren? Just 'cause, well, I... I'm feeling generous, I'm gonna throw in a complimentary basket of muffins and some extra pillow mints. They're the best. They're the finest, actually. See you guys at the inn. - Thanks again, buddy. - Thank you! - He's great! - We like him. What are you doing? Mom. Promise you won't spend all week trying to get Brett and I back together? Honey, we're just glad to have you home. So, when is this Tanner fellow showing up? Tomorrow. Yeah, Lauren and I wanted to get things set up here first. Oh, yes, right, I forgot, you're producing the show now. No. Maybe next season. So, we're really excited about meeting Tanner. Aren't we, Tom? P.O.P., in my opinion. P.O.P.? "Perfect on paper." Not a good sign. Like that Kyle P. fella from last season. What? Who is this man, and what have you done with my father? Everyone needs a guilty pleasure. Guilty pleasures. Mom, do you have any of your Six-Layers-of-Snow Cake? Are you kidding? She was up all night making it for you. Yes! Do I know my girl? You do, you do very well... too well, actually. Oh, my goodness gracious. Come to mama. Now, isn't this much better than FaceTime? Back off, sir! Back off. This is so much better than FaceTime. I'm gettin' right in here. Let's switch these parts around, though. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah, that... No, that frame, that's good. Okay. Hang on a sec. Hey, come on in. Okay. This came for you... Oh, great. I'll just leave it right here. Thanks. If there's anything else you guys need, just let me know. ...On national television. Am I gonna have to go into hiding? Actually, there is one thing. You were in a relationship with Ally, right? Yeah. Why? Did she say something? I saw her high school vision board, where you were prominent. Yeah, well, high school was a long time ago. So there's no lingering feelings? No. No. None whatsoever. Okay, because she could fall in love this week. And then we will throw a party in the lobby. That sound good? - Great. - All right. If you guys need anything, just let me know. Thank you. Thanks, Dad. - Drive safe. - We will. Good night. Good night! I'll call you tomorrow. Walter! You still work here! Oh, my... Where else would I be? Hi! Gingerbread? Of course. You remembered. It's the exact same. How? It's so good! Tanner Dylan... entrepreneur. A.K.A. unemployed. ...Formerly in the coffee business. Barista. Musician, chef, pilot... Also an astronaut! How is this guy still single? Because he's not real. Who's not real? Bigfoot. Thank you, Walter. I'll take it from here. Good night, Walter. Good night. That my key? Yeah. Awkward. Not for me. Thanks to your TV date, we're all booked out. You're always booked out. You've been gone a long time. Tourists follow the snow, Al, and when the snow goes, so do they. There's nothing but snow outside. Which has been incredibly beneficial this year, but I'm telling you, every season is getting shorter and shorter... Just really impacts businesses. My parents didn't mention anything. They probably just didn't want you to worry. Let me show you to your room. I know where the room is. I know. But I insist. It's part of our... old-school charm. You don't have any charm. Well... So... this Tanner guy. Is he someone you could really see yourself with? Maybe. Well, that's surprising. Why? The Ally I remember wouldn't go on TV to find love. Well, maybe you don't know me anymore. Ooh. That's fair, that's fair. Although your mom says you've been avoiding relationships by burying yourself in work. That's not entirely true. Yeah, she says you've been on six one-hour coffee dates since July, half of which were decaf. That is not true either. No, no. You're right, you're right. One was green tea. Okay, well, at least I'm not in and out of relationships every three weeks. Oh ho! Remind me not to tell Molly anything again. That's not gonna stop my mother. And you're excited to be reunited with Tanner? I mean, "reunited" is a bit dramatic, but... But you're thinking about him? Day and night. Night and day. "Night and day"? I didn't say that. Well, is that not your voice? Yes, but it was in a completely different context. Hey. If you say so. Let me just help you with your bag. Okay, I got this. It's fine. - I'm gonna give you a hand... - I got this. - Let me just help you. - Look... - I have it! - Come on, don't be so... ...Stubborn. Nice. Sorry. Great. You know, that reminds me of your jacket... Remember, it ripped right up the back, senior ditch day? I do. That was also your fault. In my defense, if you remember, I told you not to climb in that side of Sam's truck. Well, you said a lot of things back then, so... Yeah. And I meant them. Like about coming with me to California? I was young. We were young. - We had a plan. - You had a plan. You said you were coming with me, and you didn't show up. I thought that... if we were meant to be, then you and I would find our way back together. Or maybe you just loved the town more than the girl. Oh, come on. That's not fair, Al. Hi, guys. Good night. Welcome home, Al. He just... he frustrates me. Tanner? No. Brett. Who's Brett? The ghost of boyfriend past. Is he cute? Objectively, yes, but that's not the point. Anyway, how are bookings? Through the roof. Trish is thrilled. You get engaged, we'll be booked for years. That's Tanner. I gotta go. Good luck. You didn't have to... I didn't. It's from one... Tanner Dylan. Let me ask you something. Why does this guy have two first names? Or is it two last names? Tanner Dylan, Dylan Tanner. Whoa... That's a nice snowflake. It is, isn't it? You, left this in my truck 10 years ago. Gee, thank you. I wish I remembered to bring your "Who let the dogs out?" sweatshirt. Are you kidding me? I've been wondering where that was. Okay. Look. I've been thinking a lot about what happened between us, and... I know it's a bunch of years too late... but I am sorry. I just wanted you to know. It wasn't all your fault. Who has a vision board in ninth grade? Yes, thank you. I just had plans. I had a five-year plan, I had a ten-year plan. I... You were right not to show up. I wouldn't say that. I mean, I... I guess we just wanted different things. Guess so. You know... I think what messes us up sometimes is that picture we have in our head of how things are supposed to be. Maybe you're right. Excuse me? I'm sorry... I thought I just heard you say I'm right. I said "maybe". This is a moment. I'm right. It was a big moment. Okay, why don't you show me what you've done with the inn? Let me just sit in this for just a moment. It feels good! Oh, Buddy. Yeah. I really do need to get another dog someday. He was the best. The inn looks great. I mean, your dad would be so proud. Thank you. He's the whole reason I got into the hotel business. I mean, he hired me. He encouraged me when I had those crazy ideas. Remember when you had that idea with the candles? "Winter By Candlelight." That's it. You know, we still have 500 unused candles in the basement. - Really? - Oh, yeah. My dad meant to do it. His dream was to light up all of Main Street by candlelight. He just never got around to doing it. Then, when he passed away, I planned on putting the place up for sale, you know? Then I thought about it... What else would I rather do? Extra marshmallows... how you like it. Thank you, Walter. What about my cocoa? Get your own. Thank you, Walter. It's been so long since I've been in a lobby like this. What are you talking about? You work in a hotel. Yeah, but I work in the offices. I don't get to see the guests or, you know, get that feeling when you're in a lobby. But you're happy, right? Yeah. I mean, they relocate me every year, so there's that, but... I think I might stay put for a while, try and climb the corporate ladder. And how do you know when you're at the top? I don't know. You hit your head, I guess. Well... You know what? We have a ladder. It's a step ladder. Two rungs. But, man... I can see for miles in all directions. You know what? Come with me. This looks a little bigger than I remember it. You have been by the beach for too long. I could beat you in a kid's sled. These are kids' sleds. How many times have you beat me? What...? Still so competitive. Get out of my way! What, you barely won! That's not fair. One time. One time. Ally? Tanner! You're here. I am here. This is... This is Brett. - Hi. - He's... ...Ye olde keeper o' the inn. Good to meet you, Brett. Welcome to... Winterland. I'll, get you checked in. Are you cold? Freezing. Yeah. Hot chocolate? Yeah, let's go. So, this is your town. Used to be. I haven't been back in a long time. Hey, Lola. Hey, Ally! Welcome home. Thank you. You seem to have left quite an impression. That's the antique shop. That's the Winterland's barbershop, home of the Avalanche Barbershop Quartet and a haircut. That's Sebastian, he owns the candy store. Ruth! What happened? Ally, nice to see you. It's not the same without our long winters. I gotta run. You all right? Yeah. No, I'm... I'm just... I'm surprised. They've been here forever. So, does everyone know everyone around here? Pretty much. It's charming. You think so? What, don't you? I never used to. Okay... I need you to keep walking. Do not make eye contact. With who? "Mean Helene". Hi, Ally! - Hi... - Mean Helene. She doesn't look very mean. No, of course she doesn't. She looks super-sweet as she pretends to forget your name, puts snow in your boots, and then tries to steal your boyfriend. - Recently? - Junior year. College? High school. But she obviously hasn't changed. Did you see that smile? Clearly a lunatic. Clearly. Thank you. This is brilliant. Exactly what I hope for in a small-town American diner. Ally! Darla! This is Tanner. Oh, goodness. You're even more handsome in person. Thank you. Now, don't you break her heart, if you know what's good for you. We'll put that in our vows. I'm serious. I assure you, Darla, my intentions towards Ally are purely honorable. Follow me. Morning. Hey, Darla, do you think maybe there's anywhere else we can sit? There is nowhere else. Just pretend we're not here. Hello, Brett. Good to see you, Tanner. So, your usual? Can we get a minute? You can. But you already know what you're having. I will have a Winter Scramble... ...Winter Scramble and a Mountaintop Muffin. ...and a Mountaintop Muffin, please. Make it two. You know the menu by heart? I mean, it hasn't changed in 20 years, so. Before I forget. What? It's so cute! Thank you. It's a koala bear. Your favorite animal. The, polar bear is her favorite animal. That would be the correct answer. I love all animals. Here we go! Are you ready for Tanner to meet the parents? I'm sorry, what? Dinner, Tanner, your parents? Are you emotional? No, I'm allergic. Oh, right, flowers! Sorry. They're for your mother's house. Decoration. Are you okay? Yeah. Laur, can I be honest with you? Of course. I came on the show for the wrong reasons. To promote your hotel. That obvious? So obvious. It's just, being back here, I'm feeling... unexpected things. About Tanner? More about Winterland. Seeing everybody I haven't seen in so long, I think I never... I guess I never let myself think about what I left behind. Maybe that's why you haven't been back in so long. What do you mean? It's easier to forget how we feel about something... or someone... if we don't ever see them. I know what you're doing. What am I doing? You're trying to create some dramatic storyline between me and Brett, and there isn't one. Okay. Okay, it's just nobody likes to see their ex, that's it. Okay. Especially when they're everywhere. Ally, I have done a lot of these Hometown Dates. People come on Happily Ever After for all kinds of reasons... and sometimes they find what they're looking for, even when it's not what they thought. My advice? Just let things happen however they're gonna happen. Go! Get in there, get in there, get in there! Oh no! I hope you don't mind. Sam said I could putter around a little bit. Yeah, sure. It's... You know there are no cameras in here, though, right? I welcome the reprieve. All right. What are you doing? I'm baking a rhubarb pie to bring over to Ally's family tonight. Of course! He bakes. It's my mother's recipe. Rhubarb, huh? Yeah. Why? Does Ally not like rhubarb? I have no idea. But... the important thing is, you do. I don't. You don't? I've never tried it. Then why are you doing it? I wanted to do something impressive for Ally's parents, and I thought it'd be impressive to bring something from my mother, and now I'm uncertain. And I have half a pie. I don't suppose you know what type of pie Ally likes? It's been a really long time since we hung out, so... Right. Of course. But when we did... She really loved French Silk Pie. That's my absolute favorite. See? It was meant to be. Brett? Thank you. Thank you. Pleasure. I should probably warn you, my parents can be a lot. In what way? Embarrassing questions, mild to moderate interrogation. So they're parents. Actually, they're pretty great. I'm lucky. I look forward to meeting them. Hi! This is Tanner! Hello. Lovely to meet you, Tanner. Mrs. Wilson. - Molly. Tom. - Yeah. Nice firm handshake there. My father always said it was important to have a good handshake. Smart man. I brought this for dessert. Brett let me borrow his kitchen. Oh, my, I'm impressed. It's French Silk pie. Brett said it was your favorite. - He did? - Isn't it? It is. Let me take your coats. - Thank you. - Thanks, Dad. Thanks, sweetie. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What happened in here? Lauren rearranged a few things. Why? Better for camera. - Let me take that. - Thank you, dear. Mom, I'm excited for Tanner to try your Blizzard Stew. Honey, I didn't make dinner tonight. Lauren brought in catering. Looks better for camera. I was looking forward to it. I'm sorry. Tanner... I've got something I think you'll be interested in. Mom, I don't... Oh, boy. She hates this. Well, as you can see, she was always very goal-oriented. Takes after her father. Yeah, but I learned to smell the roses, didn't I? Before I met Molly, I was working 24/7. Sometimes that's what it takes. I thought so too, honey, but there's a lot of life you can miss out on if you're not careful. Her first cider stand. I love cider! Did she make a tidy profit? Well, she sold out in the first hour. Why am I not surprised? Here she is winning the chili contest three years in a row. And it would have been four, but Helene Green sabotaged her. "Mean Helene". We don't call her that anymore. Here's Ally in seventh grade. That's... Yikes! It was her awkward stage. I think that's enough, probably. If you want a future together, you need to know the past. Wherever Ally ends up, this place will always be a part of her. That's a lovely sentiment, Tom. And true. Tanner, I think I should show you Ally's room. I don't think you need to do that. I think so. I forgot how beautiful this view is. So how are things at the shop? Could be worse. But could be better? Dad. It's business, that's all. Come on. I've got someone to interrogate. So, Tanner, what I can't quite figure that out. Well... lately, I've been working with this coffee company that I created with a friend after we visited Tanzania. But I must admit, recently, I have become somewhat restless, thinking about venturing out, trying new things. Well, you want to be careful about that. You don't want to become a Jack of all trades, master of none. Quite right, sir. So... if you and Ally were to fall in love and get married, where would you live? Do you want children? Mom! What? Grandchildren are important to me. You don't have to answer that. No, no. It's fine. I very much want to have children... eventually. How eventually? Mom! Well, when I met Molly, I knew right away. I'll get it. Yes, well... we do have our ups and downs. At times, he drives me crazy. Likewise. But we love each other no matter what, right? Sure do. S'mores, compliments of the inn. What? Lauren ordered it. All right, I'll set this in the kitchen, and I will be on my way. Great. I think you should stay. I... Yeah. No, I really shouldn't. Come on, take some of the heat off Tanner here. You sure? Absolutely. All right! Tell you, Tom's famous for grilling Ally's dates. Well, you hung in there and kept coming back for more. Well, Ally was worth it. And what made you sign up for the show? Actually, I didn't. A friend of mine signed me up for it. Same with Ally. I was surprised when they picked me. Not as surprised as I was when you picked me. Why wouldn't he pick you? I'm just saying, you know, I picked you once. I'm sorry about him. We all have histories. Ancient history. Although, if we're remembering accurately, I think I asked you out first. No. No, no, no, no. I asked you to go sledding. Sledding behind the inn is hardly a date. It was to me. I mean, albeit I was 15. 14. Tanner... I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be. I came here to know more about you, and I am. Okay, okay, all right, Tanner, I think there's one question that all of us are wondering... what was that one thing that made you choose Ally, hmm? I don't really think there was one thing. I think it was more of an intangible quality. Intangible, hmm? I... Could you be more specific? I could... but I'll save that for a more private moment with Ally. Save it for the cameras. Gotcha. Brett, can I talk to you for a second? Okay. Yep. What are you doing? I'm trying to make sure that you don't get mixed up in all this craziness. Look... He seems like a nice guy, this Tanner guy, but what do we really know about him? - "We"? - Yeah! So he's good at everything. Who's good at everything? Who? Yeah! And what's your end game? Proposal? A ring? I don't know, and even if it is, it doesn't concern you. I'm trying to make sure that you don't get hurt. Thank you very much, but the only person that's ever hurt me was you, so I can take care of myself. Thank you, Tanner. Feel free to run down Main Street, screaming. Believe it or not, I think I've had worse. I'm sorry about Brett. No. I understand his concern. He cares about you, they all do. As they should. You are amazing. And you are smart and beautiful and funny, and your smile lights up the room. But most of all, you are genuine, just like this town, and that is precious and incredibly rare. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's fine. You owe me an apology. You're right. You're right. I'm... I'm butting out. Your personal life is none of my business. And? I am incredibly sorry, Ally. Good. I mean, you can hit me with a snowball, if you want. It's tempting. You probably don't remember how to throw one, do you? Okay. Rusty! I can't believe you did all this. It took me way too long. It's beautiful. Thank you. I should probably sell it, though. What? You can't sell this. It's kind of big for just me, don't you think? Well, maybe one day it won't be just you. I hear you have an endless string of dates. Your Mom. I'll tell ya. Who else? Well, take a seat. They never last, though, you know. Maybe I'm just... fated to be single. Well, she says that you... Never give anyone a chance. I know, I know. The thing is... you know when you know, right? I mean, it's either there or it's not. I don't think that's true. I mean, for me, it is. But some things just take time. Okay. How long have you known Tanner? Five episodes. That's practically a lifetime. Actually, six. You know, there was a meet-and-greet. A meet-and-greet. You know, maybe I should go on a dating show. "Small-town guy looking for his Happily Ever After". Not an entrepreneur... but he is a painter, if you count houses. Sure, I mean, girls'll eat it up. Right. I thought so. So what's today's romantic encounter? I thought you were butting out. Was I? Yeah. Skiing. Of course, he skis. He does, so stay off the mountain. Yes, ma'am. I'm serious. Okay. Coffee? I'm leaving. Okay. Be careful on that mountain. Yeah, right. Been doing this my whole life. Tell Dylan I said hi. You know his name. The mountain looked pretty quiet. You know, it's an up-and-down business. Dad, you don't have to protect me from reality. I'm on a reality show. Well, you can't change Mother Nature. There. How's that feel? Good. You can't change Mother Nature, but you can change human nature. I mean, I market winter in a place that has no winter, so maybe I can help. And I appreciate that, sweetie, but you're busy with your own life and career, and now maybe a relationship. Your mom and I agree... it's not your job to worry about us. You worry about me. We can't help it. We're parents. We're family. It's not worry, Dad, it's love. You ready? One second. Good. You have everything. Good. - Now we're ready. - Perfect. One more thing. Tanner... I've been thinking a lot about you. Oh, you have? And I'd feel more comfortable if I could see your tax returns from the last two years. I'm messing with you, man. Just kidding. Go on. You guys have fun. Okay. It's beautiful. You sound surprised. I guess it's just been a while. I used to be on this mountain every day. I took it for granted, I think. My trees are all grown up! Your trees? Yeah! I helped plant that grove with... Brett? Yeah, he may have been there. I'm sorry. No need to apologize. Let's talk about your exes. Okay. I'm an open book. Would that book be a romance novel? I don't think I've ever read one of those. Probably for the best. Have you ever been in love? Tough question. Is it? Let's just say I thought it was, at the time, but it turned out not to be. What was her name? Daphne. Did Daphne break your heart? Split it right in two. But that's what life's about, isn't it? Learning from our past mistakes? Yeah. Tanner Dylan has a difficult decision to make. And will she prove to be his "Happily Ever After"? Hey, what are you watching? Sharks. Look, come on, man. I'm just trying to get caught up with the show, and... What? All these years, and you're still stuck on her. You know what? She'll be gone in a few days, and then everything can get back to normal. Except you won't. Sam, cut me some slack, would ya? She was my first love. You know that. She was my first date, my first kiss. I mean, nobody ever truly gets over that. I got over mine. Ditto. You're both heartless. If this is about you and Ally, you need to make a move before it's too late. There's no move. Walter, come on. Guys. Like, if it were meant to be, we would be. Not that again. Yeah. Coming from this guy, the sage of Winterland, huh? He's right. You can't rely on fate. Sometimes you need to make things happen. Look, I make things happen. You want to make the inn busier, but you won't advertise. We've always run on the word of mouth. And how's that been going? How long did it take you to fix up your house? A few years. Try five. And what's going on with getting a new dog? I'm waiting for one to show up with a leash and a bag of kibble. All right. Fine. Sam... I'll go to the shelter. Better yet, talk to Ally. A lab mix would be nice. Buddy was a lab mix. Yeah... Yeah. Good. You can name him "Loneliness". I'm the king of the world! Hello, hello! Unbelievable. What? Someone put that up as a joke. "Al"? People used to call me that. I mean, one person used to call me that, who we've already spent way too much time talking about. So... You want to start with something a little easier? There's a blue run over there. No, I'm good with this, if you are. Really? Yeah, what do those two black diamonds mean again? Okay, so you're just one of those guys that's good at everything? Would you like a list of my flaws? I would, actually. Do you have one? Well, I will give you a list... at the bottom! Go! You weren't kidding! This is awesome! This goes on every year? Yep. It's a long-standing tradition. We once did it in a blizzard. It's fascinating. What do you get if you win? Glory. And a trophy. And valuable life lessons like never touch your eye after handling cayenne pepper. Duly noted. - Here they are. - Hello! Well, good luck, although you're not gonna need it with Ally as a partner. It is just a friendly competition. That's not what you said in '07. Well, sabotage changes people, so... Sorry. I'll be right back. Hello? Going stir-crazy in Winterland? Actually, I forgot how cute it is here. I'm having fun. But you're still plugging the hotel? Every chance I get. Good. And speaking of fun... we just closed a deal on the Swan Hotel Phoenix, and you are going to run it. How fun is that? What? Of course, it'll mean more hours, but that's you, right? More hours... there's only 24 in a day. Look, Rosie will be the new you here, and you'll be the new me there. In Phoenix. You'll love it. It's all sun, no snow. Start thinking "cactus" and "sand." I'm gonna have to call you back, Trish. I have got a literal pot to stir. A what? Oh, hi. Hi. I didn't know you were entering. It was a last-second decision. And look who you're with. I wouldn't say "with". It's a chili thing. You're trying to throw me off my game. Or maybe I just needed a partner? And you just happen to choose Mean Helene. Ally, she doesn't really go by that anymore. Right, because she's a completely different person now. Aren't we all? No. She runs a nursery. Oh, those poor plants. Pre-school. Children. - Hey. - Hey, teammate! Ally, nice to see you. You too. Good luck. Good luck. Okay. Hey. Focus. We have got to win this cook-off. Hope you brought your fire extinguisher. Why, are you making molten lava again? Molten lava? You liked it. Yeah, until my throat closed. Well, I think it's better than "I Cayenne Stand the Heat". Yes, I'm sorry, that was the winning chili. - Fluke. - Twice? Double fluke. You are just jealous. I don't get jealous. I get trophies. Don't you even think about it. No. Stop! No! Careful! Careful! No, no... You! Get off my chili. Get off my chili. Get off my chili. Lucky I don't want mine to burn. Are they always like this? Always. I can't tell if they like each other or if they never want to see each other again. That's how they are. When Ally left town, I thought I'd have my chance with Brett, but we never had what they had. I see. But you and Ally seem great. Thanks. No, no, no, no! That is too bad for you. As usual, this was a tasty and tough decision... but we've got a winner. And the trophy goes to... Bowl number three! That's mine. Working solo, to Walter Spradling and his "Yes, We've Got No Banana Peppers". Attaboy, Walter! Hey. We'll put it on the menu. How much are ya willing to pay me, boss? Eh... "Eh..." Congratulations. I'm gonna have to up my recipe. Well, there's always next year. Give you an excuse to come to town. Funny how the things we try and run away from become the things we miss the most. What's with all the onions? In case he tries to kiss her again. What are you, 12? I'm not bringing that out to the table. That's okay. I'm gonna sneak it in his Greek salad. Come on. What kind of friend are you? Tell her how you feel already. How could she not know how I feel? Because you refuse to come out and say it? Same way you lost her the first time. So, we're all set up for tonight? Good. Good morning, everyone. Ally, what are you doing here? Did something happen with Tanner? No. Tanner is fine. Winterland... not so much. What's this? This is a possible solution to the problem that no one is talking about. Okay. A very special man, who I get to call "Dad", told me that no matter where I live, this place will always be a part of me, and he's right. When Winterland is hurting, I am hurting. So, the problem... how do we get our tourists back? Change is constant. The only thing we can do is react to it, and that's what matters, so I think what we need to do is react by fixing our branding, because Winterland is about so much more than just snow. It's about hiking and canoeing and mountain biking and fishing. It's about people who remember you, even if you've been gone for years. It's the strength of spirit, and that is so special and so hard to find, trust me, I know it all too well. Winter Scramble and a Mountaintop Muffin? Thank you. Yes, please. So... here's what I'm thinking. You know, we're never gonna be the Swan Hotel. That's okay. They don't have what you have. And what would that be? Heart. History. Cocoa with extra marshmallows. So when you get back to L.A., will you be implementing a new marshmallow policy? Actually, I got promoted. To Phoenix. Phoenix? Yeah. I mean, congratulations. Thanks. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just didn't think that I'd be moving again. And starting over. Again. You know, you'd think living in a city of millions of people, you wouldn't get lonely, but I... I do. I mean, when I'm not working, which is almost never... but I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Because you can. We know each other, right? The good and bad. You know, I have known you longer and better than almost anybody else. Ditto. You know... ...I did show up back then. - What? - In California. Yeah, I know. It was a couple months after you left, and... I just... I realized what a mistake I had made, and how much I missed you, so I showed up at your dorms. I had this whole speech planned out... But then I saw you at the end of the hallway, with your new friends, laughing... What? Why didn't you say something? You looked so happy. Like you belonged. You were living your dream. I didn't want to get in the way of that bigger life for you, you know? So I left. You broke my heart. I left because I loved you. And if it you makes you feel any better... I broke mine too. I mean, it makes me feel a little better. Ally. I know that this is... really bad timing, but... Do you think... maybe... Ally, we've been looking for you everywhere. We need to get you ready for the Festival of Lights. Just one second. What were you saying? It was... it was nothing. Nothing. You guys go ahead. Have fun. Okay. Okay. There. Microphone's good. Thank you. You know who you look like? Who? You look like the girl who's gonna take the prize. What prize? Tanner. I thought this wasn't a contest. Of course it's a contest. You're gonna have your romantic dinner, and then we will finish at the Festival of Lights. Cold feet? Cold everything. Hey. Don't worry, that happens to everyone at this stage. You want my advice? No. You are a career-obsessed workaholic with no social life, just like me, so, no. Please, don't give me your advice. Fine. What's your advice? Follow your heart. I thought you were gonna say something about making good TV. Well, following your heart is good TV. What is this? It's a present for Tanner. You have been working on it all week. Have I? Good for me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. Thank you. So are you. Handsome. Or beautiful. Or both. Sorry. Is he doing what I think he's doing? No. Everything all right? It's just my microphone. Yes. Yes. Everything is great. Maybe not. Actually, I have a present for you. Something for you to remember our journey by. How thoughtful. Interesting. That's... unique. And... awkward. You know, Tanner, I've been thinking. We've spent so much time together, but I don't feel like I really know that much about you. Okay, what would you like to know? Everything. What happened with Daphne? We met at Oxford. Took a lot of the same classes. Fell madly in love... but then I got caught up in all sorts of distractions and lost focus. She wanted stability. And I suppose I just didn't want to be in one place, doing one thing... forever. But nothing really stuck. So then you came on this show to try and fine something that would... ...stick. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Hey, what happened? Seems the town's circuits have overloaded. - What? - Don't worry. We can film your scene with the backup generator. But what about the Festival of Lights? Maybe they can reschedule? Reschedule? It's the 100-year celebration. The entire town is out here. I'll be right back. Ally, I... Hey! "Winter By Candlelight"? Yeah. There you go. Here you go. Just be careful. Got it? Woo! You know... I don't think Main Street's ever looked more beautiful. I guess it's a good thing I kept all these candles, huh? But I got to admit, it's actually... it was inspired by this lovely lady, that we all know, Ally. She came up with this idea a long time ago... She always said that all you need for a perfect winter's night was candlelight and friends. And hot chocolate. And family. You know... I guess it just took a long time to realize that what we've always wanted was right here all along. Maybe you're right. Say that in my good ear. Did you just say I'm right? I said "maybe". - I'll take "maybe". - Okay. Here, let me take one of those. Thanks. Ally? Can I say something? Sure. I wasn't very nice to you when we were younger. In fact, I was awful. You didn't deserve any of that, and I'm sorry. Thank you. And I'm sorry for calling you "Mean Helene". Yeah, well, I had it coming. And you always were good at branding. Friends? Of course. Ally. Tanner, I can't believe that I'm here, never mind this far along this journey with you, but I'm so glad that I am, and I'm so grateful, because you are such an amazing person. I feel the same way about you. Thank you. It's just that... I... Both of us, we just... I'm not sure that we... We're not quite "it". What? Look, Ally, I think you're amazing too. I really do, but I think that we can both agree that "amazing" isn't necessarily a match, and you and I are not a match, at least not romantically. You have no idea how relieved and how happy I am to hear you say that. Can you just say it... just say it one more time. Ally Wilson... you are not my Happily Ever After. Tanner Dylan, you are not mine either. "Gwartz". I'm sorry? My full name is Tanner Dylan Gwartz. So you don't have two first names? More like three last names! Finally, I can just be myself. Friends? Yes. Hey. Where you going? Tell me when she leaves. Who? Who else? You were right. I waited too long. She chose him. Good, you're back here. We can pick up where we left off. We broke up. What? But we're good. In fact, I'd say we're great. Good. I am thrilled for you both, truly. But you're gonna have to break up again. On camera this time. Has anyone seen the cameraman? I'm sorry, Ally. I know that you'll find someone great. But you are not my Happily Ever After. I'm... Sorry, I'm not... I'm not crying. It's these onions. I can't. Thank you, Tanner. Coming back to Winterland made me realize what I've been missing. I left to try and find something better, and I was so focused on climbing this ladder that I had forgotten to live along the way... so I guess I did find what I was looking for... even if it wasn't what I expected. Well, I, for one, am very glad to hear it. And Park Swan Hotels are like home, but Winterland is home, and if I can get one more plug in, the Winterlight Inn on Main Street is having a holiday special... Cut! Ally. Can I get a lift? Of course. But we have to hurry. I have a plane to catch. Where are you going now? Oklahoma. Going home to visit my family. A hometown date. Sounds lovely. What can I say? You inspired me. You're welcome. And I've edited out several of your crying episodes from the show. I'm sorry, "several"? How many times did I cry? Well, you'll have to tune in to find out. Thank you for everything. Okay, let's go. Okay. - Ally! - Mom. Aren't you supposed to be with Tanner? No, it turns out, I... I have a new five-year plan. Trish offered me a promotion, and I turned it down. To be with Tanner? No. Not that he isn't a nice guy... No! Very nice. I agree. But I turned Trish down because I want to spend time with the family and the friends and the people that I love. I'm not gonna go back to Los Angeles. I'm staying. In Winterland? It's home. Oh, honey! This is the best news. And you can move back into your old room. Thank you, Mom, but I'll probably get my own place. Why? Because I'm 30. You'll always be our little girl. Actually, on that note, I have plans for the ski shop. I have plans for all of Main Street. I'm going to restore this town to its former glory. Hold on! Is that your... Blizzard Stew? It is... okay... Save me a bowl of that. I've just got something I need to do first. Where are you going? On a journey. Yay! I'm looking for someone imperfect. Someone who makes me think and laugh and makes me better. Someone who I can annoy and who annoys me. Because when you love someone... I mean, you should feel everything. Right? I know it's probably way too late, but if there is any way... that I can get another chance with you... I'll take it. Turns out... I'm looking for someone imperfect too. With a dog?! - Hi! - Hi! I think I've been putting off the important things for far too long. Meet Buddy. Hi, Buddy. So where's Tanner? Tanner is on his own journey, and I wish him well. But...? But... he wasn't my Happily Ever After. He wasn't you. I'm... so sorry. Are you? Not even a little. Have I told you that I also like romantic walks? Are you making fun of me? No. Never. Ally Wilson... you know you were the very first kiss that I ever had. Great, right? And if you'd let me... I would really, really love it if you were my last, too. I would like that. Yeah? We aren't on camera, are we? Definitely not. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
