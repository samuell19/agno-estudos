JOSEPH VISSIONAROVICH STALIN, MOSCOW COMRADE STALIN, THE KREMLIN MOSCOW 800TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOSCOW USSR POST OFFICE 60 KOPECKS From a tiny spring, a cold river did flow... Just so sprang up our Moscow! -- Of stone as white as snow! Moscow was built by a glorious Russian prince, A Russian Prince, The son of Tsar Vladimir Monomakiw! And this prince was called Yury, Prince Yury Dolgoruky! Where once beasts roamed in forests leafy, And hermits' songs sometimes were heard, Magnificent, and unperturbed, The Kremlin rose up, turrets gleaming! The great Ivan III, Tsar of all the Russias, grandson of Dmitry Donskoy, built the great Russian national state, TSAR IVAN III, TSAR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS and freed our people from hundreds of years of the Tartar's yoke! 240 years of the Tartar's yoke are over! Here's a loaf of Russian bread for you! The prince built these mighty and majestic walls and towers of the Kremlin! Years passed, Ivan the Terrible and Boris Godunov's reigns passed into history. The Russian land was usurped and pillaged by foreign interlopers. In Moscow the Polish knights usurped our people. But citizen Minin and Prince Pozharsky rose up and cried out, â€œOur cause is just! Fight to the death!" And the people rose up and formed a people's army, to free the Russian land, to free Moscow! "We won't put down our swords till not a single thief and invader is left on our Russian land!" TO CITIZEN MININ AND PRINCE POZHARSKY A GRATEFUL RUSSIA, 1818 200 years passed. The year was 1812. The Grand Army of Napoleon swept through our land approaching Moscow desecrating our Russian soil. THE LOSS OF MOSCOW DOES NOT MEAN THE LOSS OF RUSSIA. AS LONG AS OUR ARMY IS PRESERVED. IN GIVING UP ON OUR CAPITAL WE ONLY PREPARE DOOM FOR THE ENEMY! FIELD MARSHAL M.I. KUTUZOV BLAZE UP GREAT MOSCOW, AND BLESSED BE MOSCOW, RUSSIA! FIELD MARSHAL MIKHAIL KUTUZOV The endless course of history once again made Moscow its centerpiece. Moscow was ablaze again, but this time with the flame of the 1905 Revolution! DOWN WITH TSARISM! LONG LIVE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION! Bathing in the blood of the workers slaughtered in 1905, the last Tsar claimed to promote peace and domestic tranquility. But the struggle of the working class did not cease. ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS! - LENIN In 1917, the Party of Lenin and Stalin gave the people the gift of the Great October Socialist Revolution!
