"Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha." "And a rise of unrighteousness then I manifest myself." "In order to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants," "as well as to reestablish the principles of religion," "I event myself millennium after millennium." Beware. Beware. The glory of the Yadav clan. Protector of righteousness. Upholder of justice. King of Mathura, Ugrasen is here. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Glory to King Ugrasen! - Hail. Hail the king. Tell me! What's the news? Some important personalities of the town want to meet you. Bring them with due respect. I'll be pleased to meet them. - As you command. Minister, what could be the subjects' problem? I don't know, king. Hail the king. Come. Tell me. What brings you here? The subjects are like the sons of the king. So why this hesitation? King, we have a complaint against prince Kans. - What? About prince Kans? How dare you? Commander-in-chief. We should have subjects' rights in mind too. I would like to know about prince Kans. Tell me. King, his bodyguards take money from the traders forcibly. And rob their shops. King, the prince tarnishes our honour everyday. Daughters of so many families have been raped. When we could not take it any more, we came to you, king. Subjects, I sympathise with you. You'll get justice. But king, Kans is a prince. - So what? A prince should be the protector of the subjects. Not their exploiter. Everybody is equal in the eyes of law. Tomorrow prince Kans should be present here. This is my command. King Ugrasen's justice.. - Is immortal. King Ugrasen's justice.. - Is immortal. With my power, heaven has descended on earth. Liquor, beauty, fame, wealth and attraction. What more does heaven have? Hail the prince. - Come, Pradyot. Is everything fine? I'll be the happiest when you become the king. No, Pradyot. Till king Ugrasen is alive, this is not possible. Tell me. Any news of the kingdom? Yes, prince. Some important personalities in town have criticized your deeds in the court. Displeased with that, king has commanded that you'll have to be present in the court for justice tomorrow. Father dared call me to the court as a culprit? I tried to explain to the king and prime minister, but they didn't agree. I should do something immediately. You've time till sun rise, prince. Give me the command. I'm with you. You and Kesi imprison father and prime minister tonight and inform me. As you say, prince. Commander? Why are you here at this hour? Is everything fine? Everything is fine except you. What do you mean? Prince Kans wants you to be imprisoned. Prince has given this command? - Yes, king. Nobody will attend to your calls. Because all your bodyguards have been killed. The scoundrel dared to do this? I'll punish him right away. It's of no use. Prince's soldiers have surrounded your chamber. Soldiers. Imprison the king. Hail the king. Come. Tell me the news. As per your command, king and prime minister have been put in the dungeon. You've all the powers. Your soldiers are all over the town. If anybody tried to oppose, he'll be killed. - Great. Go and make arrangements for my coronation. As you command, king. We have to inform you rather sadly that because of King Ugrasen's sudden illness, prince Kans has to become the king. Priest, begin the ceremony. Begin the ceremony. I'm the king of Mathura now. And I declare that commander-in-chief Pradyot will be my chief minister. And Kesi will become commander-in-chief. King Kans wants to expand his kingdom. So he needs a strong army. It's the subjects' duty to give lots of money as tax and help him to achieve it. King Kans should be.. - Glorified. I think they're lying that the king is ill. I think its Kans' game plan. Only god can protect this kingdom. Think about your protection. - We arrest you for being traitors. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Great sage, Narad? Earth? The two of you here? God, sinner Kans' atrocities are increasing on earth. Yes, lord. He is slaying your devotees. And he's killing the followers of truth. Lord, if you don't find a solution to this, I'll lose my identity. I'll go to the netherworld. Protect me, lord. Protect me. Narayan. Lord, what are you thinking? In all the eras till date, you've rid the earth of sinners and protected truth. This time too, reincarnate and enact such a divine play, that the world never forgets it, lord. So be it, great sage. When it's time, I, with my powers, will be born at my devotee Devki's place. Lord, you are great. And Vasudev and Devki are great too. Brother, bless me. So that I can obey my father's values. I have a request, brother. Don't forget me. No, Devki. Today I'm really pleased. The great Yadav, Vasudev has married you. And soon you'll give birth to my nephew. And I'll be an uncle. I'll be too glad. Beware, Kans! You are pining for Devki's child. But Devki's 8th child will bring your death. Your death. - What? Devki's 8th child will bring my death? No, Devki. No. I won't let this happen. Devki. I'll destroy the very root that is about to cause my ruin. - Don't do this, King. - Move away. I want to kill Devki right now. Narayan. Mighty Kans hitting a vulnerable woman? This doesn't suit you. You don't know, great sage. Devki's 8th child will bring my death. I've come here to explain that. Devki's 8th child will bring your death. Devki wouldn't. Even I know this. If you do, then do some thing, king Kans, that'll solve the problem without too much damage. What do you mean? It's clear. Vasudev will give you all his children. Am I right, Vasudev? Yes, king Kans. I'll hand over all my children to you. Soldiers. Yes, king? Take both of them and imprison them. As you say. Narayan. This is injustice, Akroor. King Kans is crossing limits. Earlier he imprisoned his father. Now his sister and brother-in-law. But what can be done? You are Yadu clan's leader. Can't you explain to Kans? When someone is so arrogant and egoistic, no one, including me, can explain anything. We'll have to endure Kans's atrocities till Devki's 8th child is born. Citizens, when sin crosses it's limits, the sinner is punished. Have faith. Because of Kans's sins, god will come to earth again. Hail the king. - What's the matter? Devki has given birth to her first child. What? The first child. Look, my master. Our son is so handsome. Devki, give. I'll hand him over to Kans. No. Save him anyhow. No. Nobody can save him. Give him to me. Have mercy, brother. Spare him. He is my first son. Be it 1st or the 8th. I don't want any risk. I'll kill all your children. Give. - No. Brother, I beg you. I beg of you brother. How can this innocent child harm you? You can kill me. Return my son to me. - No. This won't happen. No. Narayan. Come, great sage. What's the news, king Kans? Do you know something, great sage? - What? I have killed Devki's 7 children. And now I'm waiting for her 8th child. Not just you, the entire world is waiting for him. Narayan. The 8th child will bless everybody. He'll give life to some and kill some. Narayan. It's time for me to reincarnate. Yogmaya. You start heavy rainfall and storm in Mathura. After that, go to Gokul and take birth in Nand's house. As you say, lord. "The ball of light is heading towards the earth." "Where the darkness of sin had spread."

Our son has reached Yashoda's place safely. And I have brought her daughter. Have patience, Devki. Have patience. How can I be patient, my master? My 7 children got killed. And my 8th son has been separated from me. What should I do? Devki. You do as usual. Give me your 8th child. I was waiting for him. And now lord of death is waiting for him. But brother, she's a girl. A girl? - Yes, brother. She's a girl. At least spare her. Never. Be it a boy or a girl, it's your 8th child. I won't spare her at any cost. No. I'll kill her too. - No. Sinner Kans, how will you kill me? Listen to me carefully. Your slayer has reached Gokul. He has reached Gokul. Kesi. - Yes, king. Go to Gokul and kill all newborns. - As you say, king. Snatch the child. No! Catch them! Don't do that. No! Leave my child. Leave, don't hit my child. My child. Leave my child. No. Leave my child. Devi. Give me this child. - No. I won't give you my child. King Kans will sack me. I have a family. No. I won't give you my child. I beg you. I implore you. Have mercy.. - What's going on? She's not giving the kid. - Snatch it. You do that. Move, coward. - Sir. Give me the child. Give me the child. - I won't give you my child. Move. - No! Use your strength. Very good. - No. There. Where did he disappear? Where did the child disappear? Again he disappeared. Ghost. Run. - Ghost. Run. - Ghost. God heard my prayers. King, we have killed all newborns in Gokul. Wow. This is what I expected from you. Narayan. What's the matter, king Kans? You seem to be very happy. Great sage, I killed all newborns in Gokul. And I proved the prophecy false. - No. You don't know anything. Nand's child in Gokul is still alive. - What? What happened? - Yes. How is he alive? You should have killed him too. - Yes. Otherwise how and when will these warriors come to your aid, king? - Yes. Putna. Go to Gokul immediately. And kill Nand's child anyhow. As you say. Narayan! "Demon Putna has arrived."

Krishna can't escape from me. This is what I expected from you. "When Drinavat was kicked." "He got stuck in the pot." "He got stuck in the pot."

Glory to the king! Tell me, what's the matter? A messenger is here from your father-in-law king Jarasandh's place. Bring him here. - As you say. Glory to the king. I'm holding Ashwamedh veneration to become the invincible king. I need your help to make this veneration a success. So I've sent you this invitation. And I hope that you'll come. Jarasandh. Messenger, go and tell king Jarasandh that I'll surely participate in this veneration. - As you say. Kesi. - Your highness. Prepare the army. I'll leave tomorrow itself. - As you say. Yashoda. Look, Yashoda, I wanted to caress him and he held my nose. Your Kanha is very naughty. "Don't envy my fate." "Don't envy my fate." "My son plays in the courtyard." "Gopala is playing."

My master, our son has become 5 years old. Yes, Devki. It's my son's birthday. I'll bathe him. Make him wear new clothes. I'll distribute sweets. I'll celebrate his birthday with great pomp. Devki, control yourself. Compose yourself. How, my master? You don't know. I feel as if my body is broken into 8 pieces. I just want to die. Devki. My master, I'm so unfortunate. I couldn't even hold my son. And Yashoda is so lucky. She has all the happiness in the world. Hail lord Ganesh. Son, give the offering to lord Ganesh. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Kanhaiya, why did you offer only five sweets? I'm five years old today. So five sweets. Brother Kanha, I'm famished! - Come with me. C'mon. It's so high. Do one thing, brother! - Yes. We'll stand over each other and reach to the pot. Okay, stand on each other. Oh god. - We are gone. Run! Kanha, what's going on? You've become very naughty. You'll be punished. Mother, don't tie me. Today I'll surely tie you. - Mother.. I won't listen to you. You've become so naughty. Let me see who releases you today. Wait. Is that so? What is this? Naughty child. It's Mansukha's mistake. - I only sneezed. What else did I do? You should've stopped your sneeze. He says he just sneezed, what else? Look. Here comes Kanhaiya. Kanha, we were really worried. What did your mother do? Mother tied me. And then she released me. Now are you all satisfied? Kanha. - What's the matter? Its dusk. Let's go home. - Okay. Chabili. Stop it. You're already so fat. If you eat so much of butter, you'll put on more. Manjire Ram. Before marriage I was so fat. Had I seen you before marriage, I wouldn't have married you. What did you say? Nothing! Oh god. Since the time I have married you, I've just been working. I don't rest at all. My beauty has been ruined. I've reduced so much. Eat more butter if you have reduced. You are feeling jealous. I am your beloved sweetheart. If I don't eat butter, who else will? It's night. Let's go to Chabili's house. - Yes. Let's go. C'mon. Come. Come. Come. Wife. Are you listening to me? Just check what this noise is all about. What's there to check? There are too many rats in Gokul. I think these rats are not scared of cats. But there are no cats. You are not less than a cat. This is over. I think something is fishy. Wait. May you all rot. What is going on? You broke my pot. Thief. Oh my god. Run. Quickly. Run. Where are you going? Today I won't spare you. Come on. Stand here. Today I'll go and complain to your mother. Wait. Yashoda. Yashoda. Chabili. What's the matter? If there's a shortage of milk, curd and butter here, I'll send some pots. What are you saying? - What else will I say? Your Kanha entered my house with his gang. Apart from eating butter, he broke the pot too. See it for yourself. I've tied him to the pillar. No, Chabili. This is not possible. Kanhaiya is asleep inside. Sleeping? - Yes. Call him. Kanhaiya. Kanhaiya. Come here. What is it, mother? Did you see Kanhaiya? Oh my god. Kanhaiya is here. Who did I tie there? What a strange woman. Who tied you? - You. Who else? Now will you untie me? Yes. - Come on! I had tied Kanhaiya with the pillar. Good that you just tied me to it thinking I was Kanhaiya. At least you didn't beat me to death! No matter what you say. I had tied Kanhaiya. Fool. You want to tie the Kanhaiya who has charmed the entire Gokul? Yashoda. Yashoda. - Coming, my master. What's the matter? Look. A sage has come to our place. Greetings, sage. - God bless you, dear. Kanhaiya, you greet him too. - Greetings. God bless you. Please come. C'mon. Let's play ball. - But Kanha isn't here. Let's go and call him. - Yes. C'mon. Kanha is here. Kanha, let's play. Come on. Dodge. Caught you. - Yes. Ball. Dodge. Radha, give me the ball. No. I won't. - Please. I'll give it to you. But you've to play the flute for me. Okay, I'll play it. You wait under Kadamb tree. Radha. Radha. I won't talk to you. You came so late. You got upset. Calm down. No, I won't? You won't? Kanha, why did you stop playing the flute? Sage has come at home. I've to go. What kind of a kid are you? Eating the food offered to god? I didn't eat it at my own will. You only had called me lovingly. I? - Yes, you. "Sage, who was engrossed in the devotion of god, Couldn't understand the secret." Couldn't understand the secret." "Whenever he worshipped god, why did this child appear?" "Why did this child appear?" "Sage's wisdom awakened." "He saw lord in the child." "Sage's wisdom awakened." "He saw lord in the child." "He fed him with his own hands." "Only you know your divine play." "Nobody can fathom your plans." "Only you know your divine play." You churn the butter. I think you're distracted. Really, I'm missing the butter thief. Butter thief? Naughty Kanha? Yes. Really. Yadhoda's Kanha is very naughty. He steals hearts along with butter. Till the time I see him, I don't feel content. Yes. Today he was nowhere to be seen. Eat the butter quickly. Quickly. This is empty. Jayanti, what was that? - Let's go and check. They are Kanha's gang. They ate butter and broke the pots too. It's Kanha. He's running away. Kanha, listen. Yashoda. Yashoda. I understood. Today Kanha must've eaten your butter. - Yes. He must've broken the pot too. - Yes. You wait. I'll teach him a lesson. Now Kanha is in trouble. "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "The whole house is filled with curd and butter." "The whole house is filled with curd and butter." "So why will I steal?" "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "I didn't eat butter and I didn't break any pot." "I didn't eat butter and I didn't break any pot." "Smearing my face with the butter." "Smearing my face with the butter." "These girls brought me in front of you." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "The whole house is filled with curd and butter." "The whole house is filled with curd and butter." "So why will I steal?" "O mother, you're very innocent." "The whole day I take the cows for grazing." "And I serve you." "The whole day I take the cows for grazing." "And I serve you." "You believe them" "You believe them" "and their false tales." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "O mother, you're very innocent." "The whole day I take the cows for grazing." "The whole day I take the cows for grazing." "So why will I steal?" "O mother, you're very innocent." Yashoda. You're under our oath. Don't hit Kanha. Gokul has abundant butter. If Kanha has some, it won't finish. Yashoda. Under this pretext we had come to see Krishna's play. Is that so? Come here. Here. Eat as much butter as you want. But I don't want to hear taunts everyday. Kanha is eating butter. - Let's go there. Kanha, we'll have it too. - Okay. Everybody can eat it. We too. - Eat it. Today I'm so happy, brother. Henceforth we won't steal butter. Okay. We won't steal. We'll ask for it. Kanha, why did you stop playing the flute? Thinking that your delicate feet might get tired. No. My heart wants you to play the flute like this forever and that I should sway like this forever. Don't know what magic your flute has. What magic? I can't tell you that. But when you play the flute, not just my heart but my soul starts swaying too. Radhe, why do you love me so much? Because I feel life is worthless without love. I'm indebted to you for your love. What debt? I love you just as much as you do. Radhe. By conquering the world I have proved, that nobody can compete with Kans. So many kings accepted defeat as soon as they heard my name. Narayan. I'm pleased to hear this. But I regret that Kans who can defeat many kings, couldn't defeat a child? Who is this child, sage? Nand's child Krishna. Even Putna and Drinavat couldn't kill him. - What? Krishna is still alive? Radhe, what is this? - Kanha. You don't play flute all the time. Why? Because when you play the flute, I can't control my heart and I lose my senses. What is my fault? Try to understand my helplessness. And I can't live without you. Isn't that my helplessness? But there's a difference between the two. What is it? Because you are a man and I am a woman. Just think. What will people in Gokul say? What? What not? "Under the pretext of filling water," "take this burden for my sake." "Radha, come to the banks of Jamuna." "Radha, come to the banks of Jamuna." "No, our secret." "O Kanha, everybody knows our secret." "Now no excuse can work." "Kanha, now don't play the flute." "Kanha, now don't play the flute." "O Radha." "O Kanha." "O Kanha."

"Your name will be taken before my name." "Go away! I know. Naughty Kanha." "You know how to steal hearts." "Kanha, now don't play the flute." "Under the pretext of filling water," "take this burden for my sake." "Radha, come to the banks of Jamuna." "Kanha, now don't play the flute." "O Radha." "O Radha." "O Kanha." "O Kanha." "O Radha." "O Kanha." "O Radha." "O Kanha." "O Radha." King, if you permit, I won't spare Krishna. Yes. He shouldn't live. - I grant you the permission. Narayan. Help. Kanha, help. Kanha, help. Don't spare it. Don't spare it, Kanha. Beat it. Take this. Careful, Kanha. Hit it, Kanha! Kanha, beat it! What is this? Mighty Bakasur is in this plight. King. It's very difficult to escape from Krishna. What? What are you saying, Bakasur? I'm telling the truth, king. Kalia. King, you are here at this hour? Any special reason? - Yes! You've to go to Gokul right away. Why? Go to Gokul and kill Krishna with your poisonous power. So be it, king. Don't worry. Who will solve our problem? Who will protect us? Only god can protect us now. You don't worry. I'll think of a solution. Kanha, we were coming to your house. - Why? To play. - Yes. Not here. We'll play by the banks of Jamuna. - No. Not there. Don't you know there's a dangerous snake in Jamuna? It is inside Jamuna, right? - Yes. It hasn't come out, right? We'll play outside. Okay? Yes. - No. This place is fine. Move back. Come on. Kanha, throw it. Here. Oh my god. The ball fell in Jamuna river. Now what? Kanha threw the ball. He'll get it. - Yes, I'll get it. No, Kanha. Don't venture into the Jamuna. There's a snake. It's just a snake. Not death. Kanha. Kanha. Oh my god. Uncle Nand. Uncle Nand. Uncle Nand. What's it, Mansukha? - Kanha jumped into the Yamuna. What? - Jumped into the Yamuna? Yes. - The snake lives there. O my Kanhaiya. O my Kanhaiya. "Seeing Vishnu in the river of Jamuna the serpent hissed." "Seeing Vishnu in the river of Jamuna the serpent hissed." "Seeing Vishnu in the river of Jamuna the serpent hissed."

Kanha has come. Radha. Radha. Look, Kanha is here. Kanhaiya. Why did you go into the Jamuna? To get the ball. - Kanhaiya is so strong. He brought the ball from Jamuna. - Yes. Not just that. I got rid of that snake too. Really? It's great. Holi will be fun. "Holi has arrived." "Let me sprinkle yellow colour on your attire." "Let me sprinkle yellow colour on your attire."

What? Krishna killed Kalia too? That boy has so much daring? Yes, king. Narayan. King Kans, Until the time cattle grazers and Gokul residents keep on having milk, curd and butter, They'll keep on growing stronger. Great sage, what are you trying to say? I mean if all of Gokul's milk, curd and butter is brought to Mathura as tax, Krishna and people of Gokul will lose their strength. King, great sage is right. Kesi. - Yes, king. All of Gokul's milk, curd and butter should be brought to Mathura. And if people of Gokul don't agree, get all their cows here. As you say, king. Narayan. This butter won't be sent to Mathura. This butter will surely reach Mathura. I won't let this go. - Yes. Such audacity? Whatever you think. I think you won't agree easily. I think that you won't either. Now bear the results. Commander-in-chief. Dead. What? - No. Commander-in-chief. Survived. Soldiers, you, in this condition! You had gone to get milk, curd and butter. Commander-in-chief, we had gone to get the butter. But Krishna thrashed us black and blue. - Yes. And he thrashed me badly too. Stop this nonsense. Tell me the truth. What happened? The Gokul residents were getting the milk, curd and butter. But Krishna stopped them. We couldn't tolerate this. We tried to teach him a lesson. But he taught us such a lesson that we'll never forget. Shut up. Dudambi. Go with all the soldiers. Right now. Abduct all the cows of Gokul. Stop. Why did you abduct our cows? It's king Kans' command. It won't work here. I think you are Krishna, their leader. You are very intelligent. You recognised me. And it's better for you all to release our cows. - Never. Kans' command can't be flouted. We won't release them. So along with our cows, take me too. I can't live without them. - You can't? Soldiers. Tie him too. - Take him. Krishna, by coming here to commander Kesi, you've come to death. Tell me if you have a last wish. I'll surely fulfill it. My last wish? I want to play the flute. Play it. Play it as much as you want. Dudambi. - Yes, commander-in-chief? Untie his hands. - As you say. Run. Run. Run. Commander-in-chief. The cows have broken the ropes and are coming here, crushing everyone. Cows? - Yes, commander. And this is the magic of Krishna's flute. The flute? - Yes. Let me see him and his flute. - Come. Wait. I'll kill you. Look. Kanhaiya is there. My Kanhaiya! - Kanhaiya. My son. God bless you, son. You've done a great deed by protecting the cows. The one who worships cows. The one who protects cows. Hail Gopal Krishna. - Hail. "Govinda Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Govinda Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Gopala!" "On the tune of your flute, not just me," "On the tune of your flute, not just me," "all damsels are dancing here." "Gopala!" "Gopala!" "The flute made of bamboo torments my heart."

"Govinda Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Govinda Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Gopala!" "Gopala!" Narayan. Come, great sage. - Why should I, king? It's so lonely here. There's just silence. What do I tell you, great sage? Krishna has killed all my warriors. Kesi and Dudambi, who had gone to Gokul to get milk, curd and butter got killed too. - Narayan. That's really sad. King Kans, what happened was destined. Tell me. What now? Great sage, you can see what I have thought of. Shankchur. Come. Tell me, king! Shankchur. Go and kill Krishna with your magical powers. As you say, king. Did you see that, great sage? - Yes. I saw him leaving. But.. Narayan. Not just Krishna, I'll set the entire Gokul ablaze. Kanha, he is a magical demon. He is setting the entire Gokul ablaze. Come on. Let's run away. Kanha. Kanha. No. No. Krishna. You killed all the men king Kans sent. But remember, the day you confront Kans, he'll kill you. And you remember too. The day Kans comes in front of me, he'll be killed like you all. Did you hear? - What? Kans wants to kill Kanha. - What are you saying? It's true. The entire Gokul is talking about this. - Oh my god. Great sage, what is this? Narayan. Narayan. Its strange, great sage. You are usually possessive about the Veena. Why are you carrying it on your fingertips? Narayan. I'm just carrying the Veena. Krishna playfully upheld the entire Govardhan mountain on his fingertips. That too on his little finger. What are you saying, great sage? Krishna has picked up the entire Govardhan mountain? How can he be so strong? How do I know, king Kans? But if he could kill all your men, who could that child be? Great sage, if you know, tell me. Shall I? Yes, great sage. King Kans. That child is none other than Devki's 8th child. What did you say? Krishna is Devki's 8th child. Devki's 8th child is still alive. Krishna is Devki's 8th child. Devki's 8th child will kill you! Yes, your highness. Call the prime minister. - As you say, your highness. Glory to the king. Come, Pradyot. Yes, king. Pradyot I want to call Krishna to Mathura under any pretext. King, Dhanushya (Bow) veneration is to be performed in Mathura. We can call Krishna under the pretext of showing his strength. But on whose invitation will Krishna come to Mathura? If Yadav's trusted Akroor goes to bring Krishna, he can surely bring him. Go and personally give my command to Akroor. As you say, king. No. I can't do this. I won't bring Krishna here. Akroor you've to bring Krishna from Gokul. This is king Kans's command. Narayan. Akroor, what kind of message has prime minister given? What do I tell you, great sage? King Kans has given the command that I should bring Krishna to Mathura from Gokul. Do that. What's the dilemma? Narad, you don't know. Kans thinks that Krishna is Devki's 8th child. If I get him here, Kans might kill Krishna. Narayan. You are so innocent. If Krishna is Devki's 8th child indeed, it's possible that Krishna might kill Kans? What are you saying, great sage? - I'm telling the truth. Krishna is Devki's 8th child. Kans is inviting his death in the form of Krishna. Now it's time. Bring Krishna to Mathura and help to liberate the world from sinner Kans' atrocities. As you wish, great sage. This is not my wish. This is lord's wish. Narayan. No Akroor. I won't send Krishna to Mathura. Kans wants to kill Krishna. You don't know. The entire Gokul is talking about this. Yes. Even in Mathura, people are talking about this. But didn't you hear that prophecy? That Devki's 8th child will kill Kans. I've heard it. Listen. Devki's 8th child is none other than Krishna. What are you saying, Akroor? I wish your birthday is celebrated each day. So that I feed you like this. I want it too, mother. Mother, enough. I'm full. Have one more sweet. - No, mother. Yashoda. - My master. Come, my master. My master, what's the matter? We have to send Kanhaiya to Mathura. - Why? Akroor has come to take him. - So what? I won't send Kanhaiya to Mathura. Yashoda, Dhanushya veneration is going to be performed in Mathura. And Kans has invited Kanhaiya to show his bravery. No matter what. I won't send my Kanhaiya to Mathura. But Yashoda.. Yes, my master. Why did you stop? How do I tell you? - What? Kanhaiya isn't what you think he is. I don't understand. Kanhaiya is Devki's son, not yours. What? Yashoda? Yashoda? Yashoda? Yashoda? My master, what did you say? I've lost everything. But who can rebuff the truth? I. - Yashoda? Yes, my master. If Kanhaiya is Devki's son then, why was I kept in the dark? Maybe this was destined. But I don't accept it. Because I have nursed Kanhaiya. I've always kept him close to me. And today, when he's the apple of my eyes and my life support, You're telling me that Kanhaiya is not mine. Yashoda, maybe this is what god willed. That Devki's son should remain with you. So now he'll be here. My master, had Kanhaiya been my son, I would've thought of sending him to Mathura. But now as long as I live, no harm can befall Devki's son. Have faith. Nobody can harm Kanhaiya. My master, how can you say that? Because Kans is destined to be killed by Kanhaiya. What's the proof? - I'll give the proof. How? - By killing sinner Kans. No son. This is not possible. Mother, nothing is impossible in this world. Still, my dear. How do I explain? That I can't let you go. I can't let you die willingly. My son. How will you understand a mother's affections? Maybe I don't understand. But I do know that there is someone greater than mother. She is called mother earth. Today she is plagued with Kans's atrocities. She is tied. To liberate her can't you sacrifice, mother? O lord. What kind of a test is this? Mother, it's my test. Your son. If I don't win the Dhanushya veneration, shame on me and my life. Mother, do I have the permission? Go, son. I don't have a right on you. No, mother. This is not true. The one who raises the child is greater than the one who gives him birth. That's why I say that I'll be known as your son. Nand's son. - My son. Mother, bless me. Go, son. My blessings are with you. May you win the Dhanushya veneration. Come, son. Father. - God bless you. Greetings. I'm sending Kanhaiya with you. Please look after him. - No. Krishna won't go to Mathura alone. Balram will go with him. Balram, you too? - Yes. Bless me. Go, dear. May your names remain eternal like the sun and moon. Now permit me. "While bidding him farewell, mother's heart cried." "For her, you are still the little Gopal." Kanha. Kanha. - Mansukha. Kanha. Kanha, today when I left home to meet you, a cat crossed my path. I didn't know that I'll not meet but part with you. Mansukha. No, Kanha. You won't go to Mathura. No. I've to go. We will come, too. Mansukha, my duty is calling me. Bid me farewell. Bid me farewell, my childhood friends. "Don't go. Shyama." "Stop." "Every childhood friend is crying." "I'm taking Gokul along with me to Mathura." "Gokul along with me." "Ride the chariot over my body." "Make me silent forever." "When Radha is not alive, who will block your path?" - Radhe? What is this? I won't let you go to Mathura. Kill me if you've to go. Radha listen to me. Get up. Radhe, not to Mathura, I'm going to my land of duty. There I've to complete the task for which I was born. Fine. You fulfill your life's purpose. My life has been a waste. - No Radhe. You are my inspiration. You are my strength. - No, Kanha. I am alive because of you. I can't live without you. I can't tolerate this separation. Can you tolerate countless innocent people being exploited by Kans and their lives being taken in Gokul and Mathura? Radhe, everybody lives for themselves. Those are great who serve others. You are right, Kanha. But still, this separation makes me feel as if I'm dying. I'll leave my dear flute with you with you as a memoir. It will always give you solace. And I promise, I won't ever play flute without my Radhe. Radhe, now bid me farewell. "You have given me your flute." "But you are taking my life." "Without you, beloved, life is as good as death." The lord of my dreams, farewell. The goal of my life, farewell. The melody of my heart, farewell. "I bid farewell." "I didn't even ask," "after parting now, when will we meet next?" "When will we be together again?" What are you all doing? We are waiting for Krishna. - Why? We'll welcome him. Don't you all know that nobody except king Kans can be welcomed in Mathura? Move from here. We won't move without seeing Krishna. Yes. We won't go. Soldiers. Whip them and move them from here. Stop. Stop this atrocity on the subjects. Who are you to interfere with my order? I? Krishna. - And I'm Balram. I request you again. Take your command back. - No. No? Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. King Kans. King Kans. Something terrible happened. What happened? Who wounded you? - Krishna and his brother Balram. Krishna has reached Mathura? Not Krishna. He is Yamdoot (Lord of death)! King Kans. We have to do something to kill both the brothers immediately. Don't worry, Pradyot. Krishna and Balram will be crushed by the mad elephant before they enter Dhanushya veneration. Run. The elephant has come. Run. The elephant has come. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Brother. What? My mad elephant got killed too? Yes, uncle. Anybody who comes between us will be killed like this. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Come, Krishna. I've heard many tales of your bravery. Uncle, I've come to show you that bravery. Akroor have a seat. All the warriors participating in Dhanushya veneration are requested to show their art. Now we want to see Shri Krishna's bravery. - Yes. You all want to see Shri Krishna's archery? - Yes. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Hail Shri Krishna. - Hail. Krishna, I wanted you to follow me to this magical palace. And you are here. Now as you can see you can't escape. Yes. And I can see that your death has closed all doors of your escape. The decision about who'll live and die will be made today. Not on it's own. I'll make it. Is that so? My fire weapon will burn you to ashes. All your weapons will be useless today. - No. It's impossible. You can't escape from my invincible weapon. No matter where a person is, it strikes his chest. Then use this too. I think you have some magical powers too. But I have such a dangerous weapon that will surely hurt you. This one. Uncle, you think about your safety. What is this? - My victory and your defeat. I am so powerful that even gods can't defeat me. But death can. My death? That's it, uncle? This is all the strength that you have? My powers? You want to see my power? See this. Did you see my power? Now see this. Uncle, I'll end the magical power that you're proud of. You don't know that even in this ordinary form, I have enough power to kill many youths like you. Uncle. Krishna. No. You can't kill me. Who kills whom, uncle? A human's sin kills him. But I'll kill you. Your magical powers can't scare me. I'll kill all of you. Has anybody killed death till date, that you think you can kill me? "Lord Vishnu who was bound by his oath," "incarnated as Krishna" "and for the sake of earth's enhancement," "he killed the wicked man." "After killing Kans, he joyously met his parents."
