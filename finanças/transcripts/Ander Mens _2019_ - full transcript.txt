- You're going to pay for my brother. - I should be the one paying. - Okay, new plan. You get Erica, we get Daniel. - Shit plan. - Okay. Fuck everything. - Shit. It's my turn. It's probably only fair. Considering the amount of death I dish out, he was bound to come my way. Don't let my peaceful expression fool you. I'm quite unhappy, and hurt like hell. How did we get here? Well, it's all Daniel's fault. No, that's not Daniel. And this isn't heaven either. Here, I'm still full of life. Well, alive at least. That's me, in my special place, with a special kind of guy. This is my special kind of day. - Do you think people can change? - I'm not that deep. - You're not answering my question. - No. - No? - I believe people can make changes to their lives, become vegan, religious, taste in music, but we are who we are. Thieves steal, murderers murder, and pedophiles, well... I love crocodiles, but they give most people the creeps. Those dead eyes, they just stare across the water. But they're bloody clever. She catches her prey, drags it to the bottom, weighs it down, where it stays and rots. I love crocodiles. Merciless. Fearless. Timeless. - Sir, you're a highly regarded client. Really highly regarded. I just think we needn't hang up on each other again. This, it's business. We're grownups. We're not kids at some farm trying to hit each other with clay sticks or something. Yeah. No, Wyngaard's gone. It's Daniel. Daniel Niemand? Yeah, from Accounts. Yes, sir, the fact is, let's just, your account's 1.78 million in the red. And this call is because, see, sir, I see your wife and children are in New Zealand? Looks fun. And that you've recently sold your house? Congrats. Which brings me to the question, it's just really just a question, sir, are you going to settle your account with us, or are you gonna emigrate? Sir? Hm. Hey there. - Hey, hey, you stop that. Stop it! Stop. Don't spray me, hey, don't. No, you don't, hey. Don't. Stop. Naughty child, stop that, stop. - Excuse me, what the hell are you doing? - No, no, nothing. Leave my kid alone! - She's throwing... - You sicko, don't touch her! I'll call the cops! - Okay, I'll go. - I'll call the police, watch me. Just get away. - Hey, babe. - What the fuck happened to your suit? - A little girl threw a doughnut at me. - What did you do? - Nothing. I just gave her a doughnut. - Why would you do that? - I was just sitting there, then she liked my doughnut, so I thought I'd be nice and, you know, give her the doughnut, you know. - Bloody hell, what happened? - Apparently, the girl he was with did that. - I wasn't "with" a girl. - Whatever, Daniel. - Come in, no one cares. - But, babe. Babe. - Thank you so much. - It'll be one of the... - Excuse me, Reverend. - Sure, sure. - It'll be amazing. Cousin Daniel. - Cousin Daniel. - I'm so glad you could make it. Thank you. - Sorry. Why is Schalk here? - You got my email about the dress code, right? - Yeah. - Magriet will squeeze my balls blue if I forget. - I can imagine. - Daniel? - Babe. - Oh. Oh, it's the other Cousin Daniel. Oh. For a moment there, I thought your friendly cousin had brought home a hobo again. - They're people too. - You're probably putting something else on for the photos, right? - Don't worry about him, Magriet. He'll look perfect. Come. - Excuse me. - There's a bit on your nose. Oh, come on, it's totally fine. - It's your family. - It's fine, they'll clean him up. - Ugh. - It's fine. It's fine, babes, just breathe, babes. - I thought your dad walking out on us would be the biggest disgrace. - Mom, it really wasn't my fault. - Why do you keep doing this to me? - Doing what? - Ugh, what a mess. - This was one of Daniel's old ones. It might fit. - That was the best I could do. Mm. - I wanted to do this sooner, but you were late. - I'm not having a great day. - Schalk and I are together. - Schalk? Our marriage counselor Schalk? - Yes. - Since when? - I would say somewhere around the third session. One of our individual sessions. It was one thing and then another. You know how these things happen. - Have you two... - It doesn't really matter. - Doesn't matter? - No, I wanna chat about something else. - Chat? - It's Schalk's professional opinion that if I wanna be healed, we should get divorced. He says he's seen this happen to lots of couples. - Maybe we should just connect a bit. Come here, just... - Mm-mm. - Just come here. Is this about the money? 'Cause if it's about the money... - Daniel, please, just sign the papers. I won't ask for anything. I just want the house. And the money. But all your things are at your apartment, anyway, right? Things are actually working out wonderfully, don't you think? Go on, Daniel, take this off. God, it stinks. - Taking these photos... - Mom? - Before the wedding's a great idea. - Cousin Daniel has always been forward thinking. - We have to talk. - Oh. - Thank you. - Yes, pardon me. - So she gave it to you. - Mom? - You're holding her back, Daniel. - Back from what? - She's outgrown you. I mean, you're without any ambition, and lately, so passive. It must have been very frustrating for her, I can imagine. - Hi. - I'm sorry, son, but everyone thinks it's for the best. - Who's "everyone"? - It's all my fault, Pauline. - Mom. Mom? - I should've known after 30 hours in labor... Just like his dad. Imagine what could've been if I'd rather introduced you to our dear Cousin Daniel. - Oh, don't worry, Mom. I really loved your Daniel very much, once upon a time. - We all did. At least, now, you have Schalk. - Oh, yes. - Hey, Daniel. - Hey, Schalk. Schalk. - Hm? Okay, look at me. Everything will be okay. I promise. Okay? This is for the best. Come here. Just like we practiced. In deep. That's it. And out, okay, cool. Chat with you later. - Chat? - All right, is everyone here? All right, can the family please step up? Bride and groom in the middle. - See you soon, all right? - See you soon. - Uh-huh, all right, that's good. All right, Granny, Grandpa, over here. Yeah, all right, let's get all the children to squeeze in. All right, yeah, it's starting to look nice. - Cuz. - Hm? - He's not in the color scheme. - He's my cousin. - What about the color scheme? - Schalk is in the color scheme. - What? - Come on. - Oh, Schalk. - No, no, no, I can't. - Come on. - It's not my place. If you insist. I love photos! - Oh, perfect. - Oh, this just feels right. - Oh, yeah, this looks good. Excuse me. You. - Yeah? - What's your name? - Daniel. - Would you mind holding the ladder, please? - No, no, all right. - Oh, thank you, Daniel. All right, here we go. All right, okay, I'll count to three, then all of you say "family!" One, two, three. - Family! One, two, three. Family! - Family! - Family! Let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! I love dark humor, but a chopped up body in a shape of a smiley face on a beach is a bit much, even for me. When you're a civil servant, a sense of humor is crucial, but this is a big middle finger for a grumpy, old bugger. Detective Johannes Ackerman. - Has the body been identified yet? - Yes, a certain Petrus Wyngaard. Or, at least, bits of him. - Mm. Well, whoever did this has a sick sense of humor. - Apparently, one of Frank's previous accountants. - Oh, jeez, get your dog under control! - Hey, fuck off! - Speak of the devil. Frank Redelinghuys. Are you the latest oil tanker to crash the beach? What are you doing here, Frank? - How are retirement plans coming along? I suggest you take it easy, you know, for the last few weeks. One wouldn't want to break a hip, huh? I hope the minister of police will at least wash your feet the day you leave. - You want one of my feet up your ass, Frank? - If you worked for me. I like to thank my employees personally on the day they leave my service. - People appreciate the personal touch, Frank. - Yes, that's true, isn't it? - Mm-hm. - Yes, I think so too. - Captain. - A little something for your selfless service. - What's that? - A warrant. - That's the first one you gave me. I kept it for 20 long years. I thought you might want to frame it. Enjoy your day, Captain. Always a pleasure. Come. - Shit! - Captain! - What? - The scene can't be, you know... - Ever since I put this on 35 years ago, I haven't broken a single municipal regulation. And you know what the hell that got me?! Fuck all! It got me fuck all! - Daniel. Look at me. Hey! Hm? How long have you worked for me? - Two years and three months. - Who saved your ass at city council? - You did, sir. - Who appointed you Mr. Wyngaard's position? - You did, sir. - Yes. I did that. Have you ever handed in incomplete work? - No, sir. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again. - Is there something I should know? Daniel, I only expect two things from my employees: They must be loyal and consistent. And a change in behavior indicates a change in loyalty. Did you steal money from me? And also, did you speak to people who perhaps you should not have? Then why are you crying? What the fuck is your problem? - My wife left me. Pauline left me. - Oh, yes. Oh, sorry, man. You know, what can I say? You know, all couples have their issues. Did you go for counseling? - She left me for our counselor. - Hm? - No wonder he's late with the books. - I'm sorry, sir. I shouldn't bring home to work. - You don't have to apologize. I understand. My wife and I also had our stuff. May she rest in peace. So what do you want to do, huh? - I thought maybe if I could have an extra week for the books, it'd help. - Sounds good. - Thank you, sir. - Please, call me Frank. - Oh, thank you. - Okay. Daniel. So what are you going to do with him? The counselor. Will you break his nose, scratch his car? Personally, I would've bashed his teeth out. - Or his balls. Hurts more. - I'll ask for my money back for the counseling. At least my half. - This guy, what's his name? - Schalk. - You trusted Schalk. You thought he'd save your marriage, instead he bonked your wife. - I guess. - Hansie, get the car. I think we should pay Schalk a little visit. - I'd be happy to, Frank. - Mr. Frank, I don't wanna be any trouble. - Hansie... - It's no trouble at all. We got you. It's good, this is good. Okay, oh, let's go. Aim for the nose, it hurts like a bitch. Or his balls. - And then we start fighting? When do we stop, like, how do I know it isn't a fight to the death? Shouldn't we talk about it first? Lay down some rules so that, you know, it's... - It's simple, just punch him. - Okay. Okay. Okay! - So why are we helping him, Frank? - As Dad said, a good accountant is someone smart enough to do your books, dumb enough not to know they've been duped, and honest enough not to steal from you. And that's Daniel. - Mm. - Daniel. Nice to see you again. Okay, Willem, remember, next Tuesday, stay strong. We'll get through this. Okay, remember, those tears are healing, right? Okay, every morning, do your exercises in the mirror. - My name is Willem, and I'm worth it. - Okay, okay, all right. Well done, doing great. Oh, Willem, remind Karen to phone me for those private sessions, okay? All right. Well done. Well, this was bound to happen. Come on, step inside. Come on. Looking good. Technology makes the clients feel a bit uncomfortable. Hence the teddy bear. Teddy bears are just so comforting. Yeah? Daniel? Have a seat. Come on. Daniel. Dan. Dan the man. You, you're better off. - Please explain how you think I'm better off. - When it's said and done, she cheated. And, oh, unfaithful people remain unfaithful. Yeah? It's a vicious cycle, it never ends. - Yes, but it was with you! - Yeah. Yes, yes, it was. So who you'd feel better having the conversation with? Because what's happening now between you and me is real. And Pauline wanted to keep this a secret. She wanted to hide it in that deep, dark secret-filled hole in her soul. But I said, "No, this man, "this Daniel, deserves a chance to move on." You deserve that new beginning. Pauline didn't want to. I came and laid myself down on the altar of your freedom and said, "No, Pauline, no. "Take me, me." There and here and there and there a couple times. Mm. It's been a pleasure. Mm-hm? Right, so what we need now is closure. That rage inside you, the dark cloud that you're feeling, and you're allowed to feel it, you must, you must feel it. It's valid. But it needs, like, an outlet, a release, a channel towards healing. Come on, get up. Yes, I can feel it. Let's change this into an exercise. Come on, come, get up. Okay, here comes a breakthrough. A breakthrough's coming, something special, just stay with me. Take your hand, okay? Make a fist, then take its rage. Take this rage, okay? - Yes. - Let's name this rage. - Schalk. - Let's go with Pauline, okay? - Pauline? - Now, push this rage to the top, push it to your fist, okay? All right, now, say it with me: Rage, you won't get me down! - Rage, you won't... - Louder, Daniel, louder. Rage! - Rage. - You won't get me down. - I'm in control. - I'm in control. - I'm in control! - I'm in control. - Now, hit me, right here, okay? - Rage, you won't get me down. I am in control. Rage, you won't get me down. - Daniel, hit me right here, okay? - I am in control. - Okay, you're in control. - I am in control. You won't get me down! Schalk? Schalk? Schalk, sit, sit, sit. What? Phone? Phone? What's your passcode? What's your... Okay, put your finger on it. Put your finger on it. Put your finger on it. Oh. Schalk? Schalk. Schalk. Schalk. Ugh. Okay, Schalk... Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Schalk, Schalk, Schalk. Let go, hey, I'm trying to perform a tracheotomy, okay? I'm gonna cut a hole in your throat, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Fuck, still waters. - I said "nose," not "throat." - Fucker's still alive. - Come, we must take him to the hospital. Come on, guys. Come on. One, two, three. - Why do you want to save him? I would've fed him his own dick. - I made a hole in his throat after smashing him in that same throat. I truly hope it makes him a better person. He's slipping, he's slipping. Oh, wait. - Where did you learn that, that thing with the pen? - Scouts. Sir, why do you have a gun? - The fucker gave me a fright. - I'll be right back. - I'm in control. I'm in control. - I'm so sorry. - I'm in control. So, what, are you guys gangsters? - I'm not very fond of that word. Let's just say, not exactly above board. - Mr. Wyngaard, your previous accountant? - Tragic accident after he stole from me. - What about Coetzee? Van der Merwe? Le Roux? - Prostate. - Where does this go? - On the shelf. - Okay. - So have you touched anything else? - I touched Schalk. - That won't be a problem. - Then nothing. I promise. - We believe him, right, Hansie? Let's get rid of this thing. - What will you do with it? - There's always some kind of temptation. And some people simply can't resist temptation. - Such temptations can lead to tragic accidents. - Now, Daniel, if that little devil comes and sits on your shoulder, then you'd better tell him "bugger off," because if you don't, I'll cut you up into little pieces and feed you to my fucking dog. - I won't talk to anyone. I swear. - I didn't think you would. - Goodness, Danny boy, watch out. My heart isn't as soft as my brother's. I'll eat you up myself. - Okay. - Great. Shouldn't we cut him up and chuck him in too? - Do you want to get in line at the IRS too? - Hello? Schalk? Baby? Oh. Are we playing a little game of hide-and-seek? Schalk? - What time was that, ma'am? Okay, please hold. I'd wait with those if I were you. - Don't mess with me, Louw. - Captain, there's someone on the phone who messes around much better than me. - Daniel. Are you awake? I thought we had an understanding. - Hm? - If someone talks to the police, there's, unfortunately, only one question. Beef jerky or chili bites? - She's saying jerky. Those books won't do themselves. - I'm on it. - Mm-hm. - Sit down, you're making me nervous. - My sincere apologies. I'm the only one worrying about that little shit wandering around like a ghost. The others will notice he's weirder than usual. - Stop giving him grief. His wife left him. That's what people will think. - Excuse me, can I help you? - The circus is back in town. Gentlemen, you have to make an appointment to see me, and I'm sorry, but my schedule's full. - We're not here for you, Frank. Maybe later. - That's him, get him! Daniel Niemand, I'm inspector Xander Louw, and I'm arresting you for the assault on, or murder of, Schalk Bosch. You have the right to choose your own legal representative. If you want, the state can provide you with one. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer, and have them present. - Cheers, gentlemen. Enjoy your day. Seems you jumped the gun with your farewell gift. See you at the party, Frank. - Don't you all have work to do?! - Please, don't smile, sir. Next! - What does Z stand for? - Sir, I'm not gonna ask you again. - Hey. - Is it Zoe? - Hey, hey, hey! - I said leave me alone! Hey, fuck you, man. I'm watching you! I'll dream about you tonight, baby! - Put him in cell three! - I love you! - All right, give me that file. Come on. - Can I use the bathroom? - No, there's no time. - Next. - Why are you so fucking calm? - Well, hopefully, Daniel will bark the right tune. In which case, we'll make his time in jail as pleasant as possible. - Or he's a little tattletale and spills the beans. - Then I'll have something to feed to my dog. Is that scene clean? - Of course that scene's clean, Frank. This isn't my first rodeo. - It's bothering me. So how does Acker know? - Ooh, I want your healing. - Just want my healing? - Heal me, God, do what you have to do. I deeply need it. - I'll give you some healing. - Oh, God, oh, give it to me, baby. - Okay. - No, no, keep watching. - You know what I mean when I say deep? - Give it to me. Oh, I'm with you. - That deep enough for you? - Oh, God, yeah, yeah - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Why are you showing me this? - Deep. - How could you not know about the camera? It's not like he tried to hide it. - Do you feel that? - Yeah, your wife's a star, in quite a few of these. Believe me, she's a star. - My ex-wife. - Ex-wife? According to her, she was ready to make the gem's sequel last night. - Only, when she got to Schalk's house... - There was no Schalk. - But there was this video. - Daniel, hit me right here, okay? - I am in control. - Okay, you're in control. - I am in control. You won't get me down! - Seriously, though, didn't you realize there was a camera? - He told me to hit him. Schalk told me to hit him. - We heard that. - "You won't get me down, you won't get me down." - But what we didn't hear was him asking you to cut a hole in his throat. - I saved his life, okay? He wasn't dead. - Then what happened, Mr. Niemand? - I accidentally hit him in the throat, so I did an emergency tracheotomy. - An emergency tracheotomy? - Dr. McDreamy, where'd you learn that shit? - Scouts, okay? I saved his life. - And then you took him to hospital, except there's no Schalk Bosch in any hospital. See, we followed up on this, Mr. Niemand. Where's Schalk? - He's dead, isn't he, Daniel? - Where's his body? - I can't say. - How long have you been working for Frank Redelinghuys? - Two years, three months. - You must've seen plenty in that time. - Plenty. - I work in Excel a lot. I didn't see anything. - Mm-hm. Mr. Niemand, I think this is what happened: You didn't mean to kill Schalk Bosch, I understand. But this guy fucked your wife. I know I would've lost my temper, but when things started cooling off, you had a problem. - An emergency trache, tricheo... - Tracheotomy. - Tri, trichemy. Yeah, all right. There must've been lots of blood, and then the body, not things that tend to clean themselves. - And, Louw, who would you have called to help you get rid of the body? - Hmm. It's hard to say, Captain. I don't really hang out with people like that, but, mm, but if Frank Redelinghuys was my boss... - Mm-hm, Louw, I think you're right. That's what I would've done, Mr. Niemand. - It's not what happened. - Then what happened?! - Speak! - What happened?! - I can't tell you. They'll kill me, okay? - Who will kill you? - I can't tell you. - What?! - Captain? - Come on, move it. - You're joking. - I don't have sense of humor. There isn't a single print or pube anywhere in the house. Nothing Schalk Bosch can be identified by. - So it's been professionally cleaned. Again. - Yeah, absolutely. I would say if it wasn't for the video, there would've been, like, no way to say who or what did it. I'm sorry, Hannes. - No, it's okay. - Surely, you don't think that miserable son of a bitch did it. He can't go to prison, they'll hand him around like a package of Jelly Tots. - No, this is Frank and Hansie's work. - And you know his testimony isn't enough for a conviction, right? If he goes to court, even. - Frank's legal team will eat him alive. - That's if Frank lets him into the court in anything other than a body bag. - Mm. Right. - And now? - Frank's strong point has always been our weak point. The slippery bastard is unpredictable, except for one thing: His informants have a tendency to disappear, or worse. - So what do you suggest? - Well, for now, we have his witness. I suggest we put him somewhere safe, and in the meantime, we're gonna keep an eye on Frank. When Frank catches up with this guy and does his thing, we got him. - Surely, you mean before he does his thing. You want this poor idiot killed? - Life gives each of us a handful of cards. How we play, well, that's up to us, but play we must. - My cards are shit. - Yeah, they are. But what if I could deal you a new hand, hm? Hm? Do you know anything about WITSEC? - Witness Protection. - We could hide you away. Give you a new identity, a new life. - I'm in. - Give me something I can use, and we'll send you off to your new life. And Frank Redelinghuys to his new one. Jail. - Sounds good. - Our program's one of the best. And Lieutenant Kruger is the best of the best. - If Lieutenant Kruger hides you, no one will find you. - I don't know if you heard, but I said I'm in. Let's go? Please? - Tea or coffee? - Just some water. And then I was back at work and everything was back to normal. And that's it. - Everything will work out, Mr. Niemand, you'll see. Yes? - Lieutenant Kruger's here. - Okay, thanks. Lieutenant Kruger, I'm glad you made it. - Louw said it's urgent. - Extremely. The man in there is Frank Redelinghuys's accountant. He refuses to testify in court, but we have a recording of it. And I suspect, as soon as Frank finds out, the shit hits the fan. There's enough to send him to prison for life. - So he has to disappear? Exactly, right away. According to him, Frank's already threatened his life. Plus, witness protection... Look for the devil, and you will find him. Too many pedophiles, they all start looking the same. Shame. - So, when... Shame for both of us. - I'm Lieutenant Kruger. If you want to live, do exactly as I say, understood? - Yep. - Anything else from your side? - Are you leaving already? - This is what will happen next: When I walk out the door, you will wait 10 minutes, then you move to the lowest level of the parking area. Wait for me there. - Am I going with her? - Daniel, for the record, can you please use his full name? - Frank Redelinghuys. Frank Redelinghuys shot Schalk Bosch in the head. - See, I've watched you and Acker dance with each other for years now, it's beautiful. He catches you, and you slip through his fingers. - Blood is slippery. - So I've heard. My point is, Frank, I don't like losing. I'm fed up with it. - You want to play for the other team? - I wouldn't put it quite like that, but yeah. - By giving me the recording? - Uh-huh, by giving you something better. - What's that? - This is Daniel Niemand. - That little dot? - He's at your police station. - At the moment, yeah. But in a few minutes, even I won't know his location. - Are you taking me for a fool, Inspector? - Maybe, but this GPS is the only way to find out. I suggest you do it before the battery dies. I'd say you have about six hours. Hmm? Bon appetit, gentlemen. I heard the moussaka is fantastic. - Okay, wait! - Frank. - What do you want? - Okay, cellphone, wallet, any other personal items? Keep your arms stretched out. Last chance, get into the car, and your new life begins. Lie low and hide your face. - Captain, yeah, he took the bait. - To reach the middle of nowhere, you have to drive very far. Past all the somewheres out there. But I like nowhere. - Wow. This is pretty. So what's next? - See, there's a house in the mountains I often use. No one knows about it except me. We'll wait there until your new identity's in the system. Few weeks max. - Sounds good. Will I get a new name? - Yes. - Okay, can it be something badass? Something like Jack Ace, or Tom Black. - You'll get a name from our database. Something commonplace from your year of birth, Jan, Johan, Fourie, Van der Merwe, something like that. - Okay. - Captain, you know we can cut off their GPS signal. - Why would we wanna do that? - I'm just saying, we don't have to follow through. I'm sure we can think of something else. Lieutenant Kruger's one of the good ones. What about her? - Did you leave your balls in Cape Town? How many people have suffered under Frank? How many more will get trampled underneath his feet? If we don't stop him now, their blood will be on our hands. I'd rather dip my toes in a bit of blood than drown in a swimming pool full of it. - Yeah, think bigger. - Yes! The bigger picture. Besides, I think Kruger can take care of herself. She's used to hard-asses. - Can I help you? Oh, this is neat. - Keep that closed. - So which side do I sleep on? - This one. - I was just joking. You'll see as you get to know me better... - We're not friends. I have no desire to get to know you better, and even less desire for you to know me better. In this suitcase is your new identity. As soon as your new life starts, my job's done. Until then, stay out of my way. Get dressed, we're going for a walk. - You know what? I don't have to be here, okay? I'm doing all of you a favor. I don't know what you know about me, but I've been through hell, okay? My counselor bonked my wife, then I hit him, then I saved him, then he got shot in the face by my boss who's clearly a psychopath. - Wow, shit life. - Yes. Yes, it is. It's the shitty week of a really shitty life, and all this is class A shit. We don't have to be friends. I'm used to it, that's fine. But you don't have to treat me like a child. You can go by yourself, I'm staying. - Erica. My name is Erica. - Erica? That's beautiful. With her, I can go for a walk. - Frank just stopped about one kilometer from them. We're still about five kilometers away. - He'll probably walk further, sneak up on them. - Should we stop and walk the rest of the way? You know, sneak up on him? - Louw, if the corridors at the station weren't so narrow, I'd have driven there too. I don't walk anywhere if I don't... Well, it's no use sitting here. Someone has to change the tire. - Um. - "Um" what? - That was the spare tire. - Damn it! Bring the GPS. - Stupid! - Now, that's a waterfall! - Wanna swim? - I didn't bring a swimsuit. - So? - And where are you, what's going on? - I'm here. I could easily take out Daniel, but the agent might be a problem. - You know what to do. - All right. - Sometimes, I think this place is too good for people like you. - People like who? - Pedophiles! - What? I'm not a... Hansie, Erica, Hansie! - Bitch. - You should've just run, Daniel. Taken that paunch of yours, and fled. But you're too good. You return to the dog that bit you. - Fuck it, old man. You can't hot wire cars anymore. These days, you need lasers and shit. - Shit! - When you wake up, we're gonna have a little chat, woman. When you wake up... Okay, come. The bunny goes through the hole, then he comes out the bottom, and fetches all of his friends. - Come. Come, time to pee. Go on. Pee pee. Come on, little brother, answer it. - Help me, someone help! - Okay. What the fuck?! - Louw! - Yeah? - Tracks. - I'm coming. - Mm-hm. Okay, okay, okay. - Louw. - Are you okay? - Wait. Can you hear something? - No. Why? - Nothing. I think my heart's beating inside my head. - Hey, hey, sit still. Hey, sit still. Sit still! Sit still! Why did you try to shoot me? - Why did you hit me on the head?! - Because you tried to shoot me! - Untie me! - No! I see what you do with that belt. Be glad I left your bra on, it's probably just as dangerous. Sit still! - So now what? Are you gonna kill me? - Maybe. Maybe I will. Shut up, I'm trying to think. - Look, if I were you, I'd get off the road ASAP before Frank finds me. Your cover's blown. We need to make a new plan. - Fuck! Is this my life?! - Where are you taking me? - I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Shut up! - I have a place. - I said shut up! Okay? Now, you listen to me, and listen well. Okay? From now on, I'm in charge, okay? I'm in control, I'm in control, I am in control! - I can see that. - Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You have a place nearby? - I have a safe house in the next town. It's not far from here. - Okay, but if you try any of your ninja shit, I'll snuff you! I'll snuff you, you bitch! - Whoa! No! - Hm. But I will. I can. - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, guys! Guys! What, no! No, guys, hold it. Just wait. We're all gentlemen. Look, we can, like, sort this out... - Just drop him, cuz. - Where's the fucking money? - What money are you talking about? Bro, listen, I got, like, six kids at home. Six, kids! That's a fuck ton of kids! - What the fuck happened here? - Anything? - Just this. - Fuck! - Oh, shit. - Jesus. - Sorry, Captain, I... It's Frank. - Hello, Frank. - No! - It's your favorite detective speaking. - Where is Hansie? - Well, depends on your religion. - You're gonna shit bricks, Acker. I swear, I'll pull the trigger myself. - Why so aggressive? I was about to do you a favor. - I'm listening. - His body's here, deep in the mountains. It's quite a mission to find the place. In exchange for his body, how about we help one another? - What are you suggesting? - Meet me tomorrow. 8:00 a.m. My partner will send you one of those pin dropper things. See you, Frank. - Boss? - Hansie is dead, we must fetch him. - So now what? - Okay, here's what you're gonna do: You'll untie me and give me those keys. There are clean clothes in my bag. There's food in the kitchen, and then we'll discuss... Daniel? Hey. Daniel. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! - I wasn't necessarily honest with Daniel. This isn't a safe house. This had been my parents' place. Murdered by the first of all those bodies now lying at the bottom of that pool. I guess that's something we have in common. Life has dealt us both a sad set of cards. - Where are Daniel and Erica? - Hang on. About 15 kilometers from here. Why, should we pick 'em up? - No, Daniel's served his purpose. We have everything we need. Daniel can have his new life. - Whew. - Daniel! - What the? What? What the hell? - Daniel! Let me out! - Fuck it, Louw. You bought jerky, you don't have to eat your fingers. - I know why they call it wrap, if the filling falls out, but fuck, it was nice. Mm. - Come. Come on. - Can you please untie me so I can eat like a normal person? - You're not a normal person. You'll stab me in the eye with this fork. - I have to pee. - So why do you wanna kill me? - I'm doing society a favor, you filthy bastard. - Really? Okay. Okay. Let's see what I've done to society. - I have to pee. - Look at this lovely photo of Daniel Niemand. Hey, sexual harassment. Wowie, huh? Assault, feeling up a four-year-old. A lad. That sounds exactly like me. Hey... - I said I have to pee! Are you kidding me? - Then piss yourself, I don't care. Who is this lady I beat up? I really gave her a go. What are you doing? What are you doing? - I told you I had to go to the bathroom! - No, stop it! Hold it. Hey, stop, Erica. That's gross! The chair's made of oak. No! Do you have paper towels? You're cleaning that up yourself. - Daniel, I'm tired. I'm dirty. I wanna take a bath. Please untie me. Come on. My legs are covered in pee. - What are you doing?! Why do you wanna keep trying to kill me?! - Because bastards like you get away with murder! The system's screwed, that's why! The world's better off without people like you! - Okay, okay, look at this! Look! - I've read your file, thanks. - No, look! - I know what you look like! - No, read! - Clive Jenkins? - I've never been Clive Jenkins, okay? This isn't my file, I've never had a file! I've smoked one joint! By accident. And three traffic fines, maximum! I'm hella boring! The system is screwed, you're right. - What are you doing? - Go ahead and kill me, I don't care anymore. - The best part of being a child is that the world constantly changes. So when you come to the realization that you're wrong about something, at least it doesn't hurt. - Ugh, I think that beef jerky is off. - No, it's Hansie. - Oh. - This is my room. - The other rooms didn't have bedding. - How? Why didn't you leave me at the waterfall? - It didn't feel right. - Daniel, I'm sorry. - It's fine. - You would've been number five. Where did you learn to tie a knot? - Scouts. - Whoa, whoa, hey! What the hell? Okay, no. - This is how I sleep. Yeah. Yeah. Erica? - Who are you beating up? - No one, I thought you, that you wouldn't have woken up. - Sit. Eat. Hurry up. - Do you think Frank's on our trail? - I have a house in Namibia. Think it's best if we go there. Cross the border, wait for the dust to settle. They'll eventually give up. - How many places do you have? - Enough. Eat. - It's a bit hot. - Louw, pop the boot. - What now? - I think Frank wants a picture of his brother. - Fuck. - Daniel. - Shit, shit, shit. Shit! Fuck! Coming. Namibia? - Yep. - Mm. - You don't know where to go. - Namibia. It's north. Hop in. - Hansie was a few shits behind. - Okay, that's fine. They're almost here. - Where? - Go and hide up there, and don't shoot until they shoot. - That photo showed shit style. It's my brother, you fuck! - Sorry, bud, that's how I found him. - So, last night, I thought you'd wanna apologize for trying to kill me, and maybe reward me with your body. - It's okay. - It was stupid of me. The thing is, the old Daniel never would've done something like that. - Daniel... - Yeah, no, he wouldn't have. But I thought that this new Daniel... - Daniel, look! - Get Hansie! - Come on, help Rona. - Louw! - Captain! - Come! - Okay! - Shit, shit, shit, shit. - Shit! - Now what? - Just drive, drive! - I'm driving! - What's Acker doing here? - I don't know. - Drive. - I'm driving. - Drive! - I'm driving! - Turn left. What the hell? I said turn left. Daniel, are you mad? It's a wedding! - If you can't run, you gotta hide. What, you've never been bullied? - It's a shit idea, Daniel. - You're a shit idea. - Mm, well, what do you know? - Whoa, whose was this? - Number one's. I know we're at church, but you're not fully protected. This is a shit idea. So what's your plan? - Okay, I thought you're my girlfriend. Okay? Karlien. No, no, no, no, wait, Natasha. Yeah. And I'm the groom's cousin. - Daniel. - Fuck. - I don't know if I should give you a hug or a whooping. I knew you were innocent, but your phone is off. I left you 200 voicemails. - Hello, Mom. - Magriet took you off the guest list. We all thought you weren't coming, now you're here with a bloody date? - Hey there, Daniel. - Hello, sir. Hello, Grandpa! Dan, Daniel! Keep breathing, keep breathing. Come. - Shit! - Mom. - Oh, my child, doesn't your mother feed you? Mwah. - Hello, Granny. No, Granny, I left home. Granny, this is my girlfriend, Natasha. - Hello, Pauline. You look lovely. Mm! - It's not Pauline. - People, take your places. The bride's coming. - Thank you. - Apart from your granny's spit all over my face, this isn't a bad idea. - What are you doing here? Leave. This is my family. No, Grandpa. Grandpa, no. No. Don't. Not here. What are you doing, we're in church. I told you... That's my niece. - Sorry. - Will everyone please stand? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Sorry. - That's my grandpa. - Everyone, out. - You may be seated. - If you do what I do long enough, and have seen everything I've seen, you get a hunch when you've reached the end of the road. - Shit style, Frank. That was his grandpa, you fuck. - Yes, you took me for a fool. - Mm. - You used Daniel as bait? - What? What, why, what? You substandard policemen, okay? And you, you're a substandard boss, so fuck you. - Eh, I'm crying. This little shit is mine. You're going to pay for my brother. - I should be the one paying. - Okay, new plan. You get Erica, we get Daniel. - Shit plan. - Okay. Fuck everything. - Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant. It is not rude. - It's not irritable. It does not keep a record of wrongs. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things. It endures all things. Love is eternal. - Say hi to my brother, you fuck. - At fucking last. - You may now kiss. - Woo, Daniel! - Woo! - Upstairs, they have a happy ending. But down here, it's a different story. - Erica, hey. Hey. Erica? - Someone phone an ambulance. - Go. - Daniel Ignatius Niemand! - Go. - I'm not Daniel Niemand! I'm a different person. As the saying goes, no one gets out of life alive. I'm proud of mine. I wouldn't change a damn thing. Except maybe for Daniel. If we only had a bit more time, who knows? As I leave this world, I think of Daniel on his way to Namibia. Has he really changed, or has there always been somebody behind the nobody? If only we... Wait. He doesn't have a passport. He'll be okay. Everything will be okay.
