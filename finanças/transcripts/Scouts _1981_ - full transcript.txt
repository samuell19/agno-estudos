Dear parents, Our trip is going really well... my friends are really nice to me, and I'm having a lot of fun. For three days We've boon playing paperchases We were split into teams of two, with maps... and a compass and we set off towards an abandoned chapel The Chapel of Angels! It's in the middle of the mountains so we have the climb all the time. As the priest said, it's to develop our senses of initiative and orientation. The initiatives are always taken by me! I'm not too bad at orienteering The boy I'm with is called Alain and I'm always having to save him despite him being elder then me. He never says anything. He lets me do everything. We have same enjoyable chores, some unpleasant ones, and we share them. One time it's him. Another it's me. We've brought some clothes, some biscuits, some gingerbread... and the tubes of concentrated milk you sent me in your last parcel. Every has to do their chores. Ange and Diego are lucky the priest has gone with them. In this heat he must be really hot under his cassock. He says it's because they're more resourceful then us. But... I know them! We've spoken. They're biding their head! I'm sure they're his boy-wonders. He needs to keep his eye on them because they're always making mistakes. We've learned some new prayers. The priest said to us, "Love one another" And every day we have to do our good deeds. I like doing my deed for the day because our motto is: "All for one and one for all" The priest hasn't asked me to help him say Mess. Often, in the afternoons, he stays alone with his service book. He's often saying his prayers but he never wants us to stay with him. This afternoon the priest came to watch us. You know, mother, he's very nice, the priest. This morning I found a rock that overlooks the entire valley. I called Alain. And whilst running to me he sprained his ankle. It's lucky that we're done first aid. I had to massage him for ages. And the pain went. Afterwords... he was much better! In the evenings we're tired by all we've done! Medhi and Jean-Paul kept watch at the camp. They must be really bored! We set up camp next to a mountain stream. It's great... a bit like a beach! Every morning we wash. The water's freezing but it wakes us up quickly! I always need to hide my soap. I don't know what the others do with theirs but it vanishes every time. As for David and Claude, according to their itinerary I expect they'll run into big trouble! They have to cross dangerous waters and climb rock faces. They've the shortest but most difficult route! Well... And now, my dear parents, I'll leave you because I'm going to have a siesta. I hope to camp again with my friends next year. Lots of kisses. Hello to Auntie Yvonne. Ah! Mother... I... think that my shorts are too... short. Subtitles: JDC Studio Adaptation: James Coates
