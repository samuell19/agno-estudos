Marid! What? You're not making me late again. Dirty clothes in the bathroom, I'm washing tomorrow. Ever heard of a washing machine? I wish! I'll ask Father Christmas, okay? Come on, get up. Hey, get off my case! Last time I checked you weren't my mother. Yes, but I'm your older sister, so same thing. I'm the boss around here. - Hey! Where's my coffee? - First brush your teeth. Jeez... Wow, chill out, cuz... Hey, voetsek. - Jeez... - Relax, Nazeem. We're on our way. I think it's crazy you like Nazeem. That guy thinks we're his property, sis. Leave Nazeem alone, he's alright. Uncle Amir just puts a lot of pressure on him. You make nice excuses for your boyfriend, hey? Yes, and you keep moaning. 'Lantis Central! Yeah, yeah, right here. Hello, my auntie... Morning, driver. Hello, Auntie. - We need to move! - Bloody rude! Ooh sorry, Auntie. Why are you going shopping, Auntie? Hot day like this you should be on the beach showing off your bikini. Uh-uh, mind your manners. I need to shop for my daughter's wedding. Oh... do I know your daughter? I certainly hope not! No man, Auntie... Shush, you. Hey, where's the cash? - You should be ashamed of yourself! - Shut your mouth, Auntie! Hey, shut the fuck up. Just give me the... Voetsek! Get lost! Go! - Are you alright? - What's this place coming to? Auntie, that's our Atlantis for you. Atlantis... Drop off my mother-in-law here! Give her some discount! 'Lantis Central! Mother with the red dress! Protea Park, Avondale! There must be something better out there for us. What can you do, brother? Another day, another dollar. - A dollar for Uncle Amir, yes. - Just remember how lucky we are. - For working like dogs? - Watch it, okay? You were still a kid when Mommy passed away. Uncle Amir didn't owe us anything but he was always there. Made sure that cheeky little mouth of yours always had something to eat. Yeah, yeah, play another tune. I've heard this happy family song before. It's like talking to a bloody wall. Show some respect! Check out your boyfriend's new buddies. What are those thugs doing with Nazeem? Those guys are nothing but trouble. Hey, I'll take the cash. Stay out of Nazeem's business. You! Can't you see we're busy? Marid? Come on, bring the money. Come on. Why must I go? Like they give a damn if I pitch. Same old shit every Friday... Do you really want to discuss this again? - I'm just saying it as it is. - That's not true. Only because you're Uncle Amir's favourite girl. And you're Auntie Aliyyah's darling little boy. It's family dinner once a week... It's the least you can do, please. Those people aren't my family. Auntie Aliyyah is Mommy's cousin... do the math. - Then why do I feel like a charity case? - Hey... Without them it was straight to the orphanage. Think about that for a change. Must you always complain? Alright. You go on, I'm just going to swing past Junaid's on the way. No man, Marid, you're gonna be late. I don't want to keep Uncle waiting. No, no... Have I ever let the side down? I'll be quick. Cross my heart. And? What do you think? So all of this is for Nazeem? Gotcha! Hey! Get lost. Don't be late. - Salaam, Ra'ida. - Salaam, Auntie Aliyyah. - Look at you... - Thank you. Sorry, am I early? You're right on time. And where's my baby? Marid's on his way. He wouldn't miss your cooking for the world. - Great. - I'll sort it out tomorrow morning. - Ra'ida! - As-salamu alaikum, Uncle Amir. Not a moment too soon. Come, I want to show you something. You look beautiful, Ray. Guys, it's a quick in and out. We only take a taster, okay? Hey, check this out. - Check this out. - Jeez, let me see! - Hey, are you insane? - What did you go buy that for? No, it's just a backup, man. Jeez... Now we just need a bow and arrow, hey? What the fuck's wrong with you? I'm Robin from the Hood, bro! We steal from the rich and give to the poor. That's for sure! - You heard that? Robin from the Hood! - Right! The Robin of the Hood. No, man. There's fuck all here! It must be here somewhere. Hey... what's this? - Loaded, guys. - Hey, move up. Jeez! - Jackpot. - Guys, we don't have to take everything. Don't be greedy. Shh... What? Hey, wait for my signal then we go. Nazeem, is it you? Come on, Marid! - How's that? - Sounds great. No one has an ear for a motor like you. That's why the boys are scared of her, Dad. Whatever. - Where's that brother of yours? - He knows what time dinner is... He just had to go past Junaid's house. Junaid? That's Marid's buddy? He'd better watch out who he's friends with. He'll probably leave home any day now... Keeps saying there's more to life. He should be careful of leaving the nest... Without family we're nothing. Yes, Uncle. I keep telling him that. Amir, hello? What? Thanks for letting me know, I'll send Nazeem. Hey... - There's a problem at the garage. - What problem? Go find out. Come, my child. Let's eat. - Hello, what's going on here? - Sir... And this? What's the story here? He only started last week, sir. Sorry to hear that. No... No... no. Fuck! Hey, Dad? No, no, don't worry. I'm sorting it out. Okay, okay... - Captain Grootboom. - Captain... - No problem here. - Are you sure? They tried with the safe, but we don't keep cash on the premises anymore. We interrupted them before they could finish. Good job. Shout if there are any medical expenses, okay? Thank you, sir. I'll look around. We have to meet. Same place? Safe... Where's Nazeem? The garage. We don't have to wait for him. Amir, surely he's not working on a Friday night? He'll be here soon. I'm going to wash my hands. - Sis? - Where the hell are you? What's going on? Jeez, sis, sorry. I'm on my way. - Are you? - Five minutes, sis. What's wrong? I'll be there now. Guys, I'm gonna split, but I'll check you tomorrow, and... we need to sell this shit fast, okay? You... I just figured out your problem. - Uh? - You are whipped. And by your own sister, not even a proper goose! You, shut up! Wait, if I pitch now it'll be the perfect alibi! By the time Nazeem finds out what happened I'll have been with the family all night! They're gonna think it's the other gangsters. - Nazeem, no! Nazeem, please! - You, shut up! Nazeem, it's not what you think. It's not my fault. Don't talk shit to me! You can't shoot me, I'm family. Family or not, no one steals my stash. It's time you youngsters learnt that. It was a mistake, Nazeem, I know. I won't do it again, I promise. You're right. You fucking won't. - Voetsek, you. - Get up. Nazeem... What will Ray say? You can't. You know what, cuz? You're right. You're dead right. - Huh? - Take it... Take it. If you want to be part of this family... now's the time to decide. The wrong decision will be your last. Or... you do what a real man would... and show which side you're on. Marid... - Marid, please... - Shoot the fucker. Hey, shoot him. Marid, please! Marid... Shoot him, you fucker. Please, Marid... Please! - Hey, what's wrong with you? Shoot him. - Please. Please, Marid! - Shoot him, you! Shoot him. - Please, please... - Please, Marid, please... - Shoot him, you fucker. Shh... it's alright. It's alright, cuz. Come on, you fuck. You're not such a fucker. Come on. Amir, the food's getting cold. Then dish up, my darling. I'm ravenous. Sorry, Uncle, I don't know what's keeping Marid. He said he'd be here. Maybe he has more important things to do. - Bismillah. Dish up. - Thank you. Where must I go? Don't worry, cuz... Everything's sorted out. Maybe you must lie low for a bit. Just till the heat is off. Hey, my daddy will know what to do. What's this? We don't want Ray to worry, do we? Maybe you must write her a letter. What must it say? - Are you sure I can't drop you? - I'm fine, Uncle. - Okay. - Thanks for tonight. It's a pleasure. Hello? Okay. I'm too busy for you, bro. Drop me a line. Marid, if I get hold of you you're in deep shit. Phone me. It's terrible. The police are here. Are you on your way yet? Gotta go. I'm Captain Grootboom. Can I please speak with you, Miss Hendricks? You phoned us at about quarter past ten. Why were you here in the first place? My brother... It's his buddy's place. - And his name? - Marid Hendricks. I phoned him at about 8 o'clock and he was still hanging out here. He was just leaving when we spoke. - Okay, and where is he now? - I don't know. I'm worried, he's not answering his phone. So Marid was the last person to see them alive... What are you trying to say? Don't get upset with me, miss, I'm just putting all the facts together. Now I have to talk to Marid. We meet again. I see you're busy tonight, hey? He's not here. Don't worry. I'm sure he'll show up. I'm sure nothing happened... Maybe you just need some sleep... I'm too busy for you, bro. Drop me a line. Hi, Auntie Ray! She went jogging. - Jogging? - Yes. When? What time? - Miss Hendricks. - Hello. Can we come in, please? Come in. - Both of them? It's both of them. - That's shocking. He hasn't come home yet. - His bedroom's through there. - Okay, please start. Please come with me. Don't worry, it's just part of the procedure. If you don't mind... - Then we go index... - And this? Am I the criminal now? No, it's just to compare with the other prints we find. We need to know what Marid's prints look like. Do you mind if I borrow this one? Sure. Okay. Okay, you can finish up now. I need to get to work. Ray? What's your little brother playing at? - This is really bad. - I have no idea, Uncle. He didn't come home last night. I heard the police found drugs at Junaid. Drugs? I didn't see any drugs there. They think the kids had an argument and Marid ran away with the drugs. Bullshit! Sorry, Uncle, but... Marid isn't like that... stealing drugs and killing his friends. No, Uncle, you know him. He's not like that. - Are you sure? - Dead sure. There's a difference between playing a rebel, like him, and picking up a gun. Don't get worked up, Ray. Let the police do their job. What can they do? I'll look for Marid myself and find out what happened. This is no job for a woman. What if something happened to you? I couldn't allow that. - Do you hear me? - I know you really care about me, Uncle... - but this is my little brother. - Ray... Look here... We'll sort this thing out, okay? Huh? Nazeem... keep an eye on your cousin. That girl's full of guts, but she's looking for trouble now. On it. - Hello, where does Hadiyah live? - Straight, and right. Okay, thanks. - Hey, boetie, is Hadiyah here? - Yes. Please call her. Mommy, someone's here for you. Salaam, Hadiyah. Sorry for your loss. You're out of your fucking mind if you think you're welcome here. - Sorry, do I know you? - I know you. - Can we talk? I just want to hear... - I don't talk to bitches like you. We have nothing to say to each other. - Junaid and Marid were friends. - Doesn't matter... It's not just Marid, it's the whole lot of you. Your family thinks they're the cream of the crop, hey? You! You're all rubbish, man. Hello! Don't you talk about my family like that! You don't know us! Nothing in the world is more important than a man's family and his community. I hope that with this new building, we as a community can come closer together. It's a place where we can spend time together again as families... A place where our kids can play, and where we as parents can discuss important matters. This is something I never had growing up here. - Our playground was the streets... - Yes... And what rough streets they were. But today? Today we can raise our kids differently, show them a better way. So, it brings me great joy... to declare this community centre open. That's it, let's celebrate. Oh boy, I'd love a boerewors roll... Thank you. Najwa? I'm really sorry about Nusrah. I have nothing to say to you. What do you want from me? Nusrah's your brother, you must know something. What were the kids up to? Why should I know? Did you? How would I? All the young guys here mess up. - Maybe Nusrah got what he was looking for. - I just want something... Anything that can help me find Marid, please! Hey, keep it down! The police already think this is about drugs. Our brothers were young, they had no idea what they were doing. If you want to know about drugs... Go ask your dear Nazeem. Nazeem? - What do you mean? - Oh please, Ray! I know they're your family, but it's time you catch a wakeup. Nazeem isn't involved with that stuff. Don't drag me into your love life, okay? You're not the one with a brother in the coffin. You definitely have no idea how that feels, huh? Sorry, can I try this one on? You look so pretty. - Salaam, Auntie. - Salaam, Ra'ida. Ooh, let me quickly give him one. There you go, my darling. Heard anything from Marid? I'm really worried. Don't you worry. I'm sure you'll hear from him soon, hey? Grab a plate, you need to eat something. No thanks, Auntie, I'm not hungry. - Where's Nazeem? - No idea. These men of mine lead their own lives. You would do well to do the same. Captain? I'm on my way. So... we keep it business as usual. What about old Grootboom? What about him? They're fucking useless. It'll take them a while before they find Marid. I know my brother... Marid would never have a gun. The good news is that they fast-tracked forensics, thanks to your uncle. He had a word in someone's ear. That's good. The bad news is that the fingerprints we found in Marid's room... are the same as on the gun. The gun that shot his friends? I'm sorry. It must be a mistake. No mistake. Marid isn't some druggie gangster. - Yeah, who knows with the kids of today? - I know my own family. If you say so, but ask Nazeem how these things work. - Maybe it's in the genes. - What are you talking about? The fancy clothes, that car he drives... Pretty flash for someone who only runs taxis. Hi, have you seen Marid? Okay, thanks. Hi, Auntie. I'm looking for my brother, Marid. Have you seen him? Okay, thanks. Bye. - Zulpha, have you seen Marid? - No, I haven't. I'm looking for him everywhere. Hi, a newspaper please. Thanks. Hello, guys. Sorry, I'm looking for my brother. - Have you seen him anywhere? - No. Hey, listen, have you seen this boy? - No, sorry. Haven't seen him. - Sorry. Sorry, I'm looking for him. Have you seen him? Sorry, I'm looking for my brother. Hey, voetsek! We don't want your kind, your family, around here. Don't drag us into your shit, okay? Get lost. Shoot. - Hey... - I've been looking everywhere for you. If you're looking for me then it's my lucky day. Stop it. I've been hearing things about Marid and the boys. What boys? - I thought I was the only boy for you. - Not now. Nusrah and Junaid, what do you know? As they say, if you play with fire you're gonna get burned. Marid should've known better. And now? What is it with you and... And now Marid's taken off. Trust me... That's the best thing he could've done. The best thing would've been to stay and explain what happened. If he had something to do with it he must take responsibility and tell the police. If he shot his friends, he must lie low. He must stay wherever he is. No, Nazeem. Marid must come home so I can help him. If you know where he is, you'd better tell him that. If you know and you don't tell him... I'll never forgive you. Ray... Ray! Wait. - You're late. - Haven't you seen Marid yet, Uncle? Stop worrying about Marid, you promised to drive this one for me. - Sorry, Uncle. - Sorry? There's no "sorry". I've got big money on you. I really can't concentrate on this now. Can't you scratch tonight, Uncle? Scratch? That word doesn't exist in my vocabulary. There are no quitters in this family. What about Nazeem? Nazeem? No... I'm not here to lose. This is your job and you know it. - Fine, but I don't promise anything. - Hey... Just do your best, my child. Okay? Hey... Good luck. Check here... You know how important this is to him. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm alright. - Hey... - Hey. You did good. And you made Dad proud. - Hey! What are you doing? - You deserve it. - Pride of Atlantis. - No, man, stop it. - Open the door. Come on, open it. - Okay, wait. And now, why are you carrying me in? Are we married? Don't be silly... How can I marry my cousin? Hey, that was a joke. I'm playing with you. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Ray, don't worry about me. You don't need any trouble. I had a problem and have to go away. Keep your head above water. Things will come right. Love, Marid. Mrs Abrahams! Sorry, Auntie, have you seen Marid this morning? Sorry? I can't hear you! Did you see anyone at my door? Why would I see anyone? Auntie, we know you see everyone and everything. - Maybe a car? - What kind of car? It was dark. - Did you see anyone inside the car? - I couldn't say, it was just a car! - A fancy car. - Fancy car? That's if there even was a car. Oh no, Auntie. That's just Nazeem, my cousin. Thanks. - Salaamu, Ra'ida. - Wa Alaikum, Auntie. - Heard anything from Marid yet? - No, Auntie. - Is Uncle here? - No, he's out with Nazeem. Come through and chat with me for a bit instead. - Would you like some tea? - No, I'll just have some juice. No, someone made a mistake somewhere. Marid... was always my favourite. My cousin's baby boy. Sorry, Ra'ida. Don't get me wrong, of course I'm mad about you too. It's just that Marid has a cute little smile, doesn't he? Back when he was a little boy he was so naughty... But one always forgave him because he has a good heart. - He wrote a letter. - Oh? Said he's gone somewhere. What? Who gave you this? I don't know, I wanted to show it to Uncle. It's no use waiting for him. Sometimes I don't even know where he is all day. I don't know what to make of this... Marid has gone away? I'll let the food simmer... Are you okay, Auntie? Don't get so upset. No, I... I just need to lie down a bit. Okay... - Captain? - Miss Hendricks... Ra'ida. It's just Ra'ida. Can we talk for a moment, please? Alright... How can I help? - Are you sure this is Marid's handwriting? - Definitely. I taught him, I know how he writes. Now what? Look, your uncle? He can help you way better than I can. If Marid's out there... Amir will find him. What can my uncle do? You're the detective. Your uncle has more connections in this town than I can ever dream of. Marid's case is filed under pending, we'll just have to wait until he turns up. - Is that it? - Look... If I were you, I'd be hoping my brother was halfway to Mexico by now. There's nothing left for him here in the ATL. Thanks, Detective. What are you doing, huh? Do you know who I am? You think I don't know who you are, driver-bitch? You're a pain in the arse just like your brother, you know that? What do you know about my brother? Relax, you. Relax, relax, relax... I know your little brother has split. If you carry on snooping around... you're going to vanish just like him. Do you understand me? Hey, wrap this up. Did you hear me, bitch? This is your last warning, okay? I don't want to see you again. Let's go. Don't look so serious! You look lovely, so cute. - Where's your dad? - He just left. Can I help you? I don't think so. What happened? I walked into a wall. Ray... You must be careful, okay? Now that Marid's gone... you're a woman alone. Let's go for a drive somewhere. I can't sit alone in that house. Sure, let's go. The usual for me, and for the lady? Just Tab, please. And make sure your crayfish is fresh, okay? Gansbaai, not Mozambique. Certainly, sir. How's your father doing? Yeah, he's fine. - Seems everyone knows your dad. - It's obvious, he's the King of Atlantis. Oh, does that make you the Crown Prince? I knew someday my prince would come. Flattery gets you everywhere. You're someone who knows people, right? - I like to keep my finger on the pulse. - I'm desperate. I have no one else to talk to. Marid left me a letter. And, isn't that good news? Maybe. But other people are definitely involved in this. - The captain thinks so too. - That detective? Really? I'll tell Dad to chat to him. He'll know what to do. If Uncle Amir wants to help he must hurry up. Marid is his cousin's child, after all. Sort of... only by marriage. Sir... - And for the lady. - Thank you. And you? What about you? Why haven't you married? Don't you want a husband, or kids running around? And look after Marid as well? No, that's impossible. That kid's enough of a handful. But he's out of your hair now. Maybe get on with your own life. Don't you want to know what Marid wrote? Sure... If you want to tell me. That's not true. Only because you're Uncle Amir's favourite girl. Those people aren't my family. Gotcha! Why must I go? Auntie Ray, come look here! No! Marid! Uncle! Ray? Okay, okay... We'll meet you there, okay? Ra'ida? Uncle, help me, please. He can't just lie here like this. No, leave him alone. We can't leave him like this for everyone to see. - Give me your jacket, please. - Leave him, the police are on their way. No! - It's my brother, your family! - Hey! Leave the child. This is evidence. It's the Law, Ra'ida. We have to accept it. - Who's responsible for this, Captain? - I can't tell yet. Whoever's drugs these boys stole must've been very upset. Wrap this up, I don't want this hanging over my family. Ra'ida, I'm sorry, you must come with me to the station. There's paperwork that you need to sign. My son and I can bring her later. She needs to shower and change. Sure. See you later. Who could've done this? It seems Marid upset someone badly. You could say it's a warning to others... "You step out of line, this is what happens." Marid wasn't a gangster. That's one thing I'm sure of. If you say so. How did you know where to find me? Nazeem told me. Nazeem? Really? Yes. Anyway, it's not rocket science. That place is a dumping ground. - A dumping ground? - Sorry, I... Marid's not the first one we've found there. When can we have Marid's body? I'm sure you'll understand we need to bury him before sunset. It's our law. Ra'ida, I need you to sign. I can't believe it. Even if it's true and Marid really murdered his friends... we still need to find out who killed Marid. Oh, Ray... let it go. Stop trying to play Cops and Robbers, I'm serious. Leave it for the right people. No, I'll never leave it. I want justice. There's only so much you can do. Marid was just a cheeky kid... He didn't deserve any of this. No one does. He was shot like a dog by these cowards and left on the sand for the birds! The car's outside, when you're ready. Let's go, my child. Come inside, your auntie would love to see you. I need time to think, I'd rather walk home. Nazeem... make sure she gets home safely. Something else is going on here... something dangerous, and I don't want you to get involved. Here's a little something for you. Maybe you should just stay home awhile. I don't need your money. We all need to think carefully about what happened here, Ray. This family needs time to heal. I just want to bring him home. Bring him here. That's what everyone expects anyway. - But Uncle... - No. I'm done talking. What have you done? I gave her some money. That's not what I'm talking about. Then what are you talking about? My cousin's child... Marid. They're bringing his body here... You can cook, leave the rest to me. Are you coming in? Remember when someone phoned you on Friday night? - Who? - It was the police. When they broke into the garage. And? Do you think that has anything to do with Marid? Marid? Nah, that's a whole different story. - What do you think they stole that night? - Nothing, Ray. They're not connected. - It was just a false alarm. - You're lying. I saw the seats from your cab. - My cab? - The old one. Someone ripped the seat up. So? It's an old cab. You obviously had something that someone wanted! Why can't you just be honest? What do you want from me? What? I want the truth. I want to know what really happened that night. It's no secret... - Everyone knows about you and the drugs. - What drugs? Just be a man and say it! Okay, sure... I've moved a few things here and there, that's it. But there's money in this business, so sue me. People want product and I supply. It's not like I stand outside a bloody school with the stuff. Okay, relax... I'm not judging you. What then, Ray? What is it? So Marid's buddies stole your drugs, hey? So that's what you think? You think I shot them? Tell me, what must I think? Whoever shot them... did me a favour. - Those fucking thieves deserved it. - And Marid? Do you really think he shot his own friends? How must I know, Ray? That's not like Marid, so it's obviously that other gang. Ra'ida... It's a dog-eat-dog world out there in the streets of ATL. You need to wake the fuck up. You hear me? What are you doing here, Ray? You have people waiting at home. They're not my people. They're only there for Uncle Amir. They're there for the whole family, and you're part of the family, Ray. Do you know what Marid always said? That we're not really part of this family. Are we? Hello, Grootboom speaking. Captain, sorry to disturb you. No, it's okay. I was about to phone you. The coroner's report is out... Is there news? Yes, Marid's time of death. Sometime between 9 pm and 11 pm on Friday. That's just after Nusrah and Junaid's. An hour or two. - How is that possible? - Exactly. What does that tell us? His letter... He said he was going somewhere, but I got it two days later. You see now? So whoever took Marid's letter had no intention of letting him go. The only place Marid was headed was straight to the dump. Anyway, you called me. How can I help you? Something you wanted to ask me? No it's okay, thanks. What's going on with this business? - I thought you were on it. - I am. I'm trying. - But I know Ray, Dad. She won't stop. - It's bad for the family. I can't allow her to run around the streets asking questions. I know. It's embarrassing. But she's sharp. - I don't know what else to tell her. - Nothing. How do we get her to drop the bloody thing? I don't know. But what the hell does she want? Justice. That's what she said. Justice? I think it's time you marry her. Then this thing can blow over and we can all be happy. What are you doing here? Dad isn't here yet. The captain said you're the one who phoned him when I found Marid. Yes, Dad asked me to. How did you know where to send the police? Lucky guess? Mm... and what about Marid's letter? I know you left it for me. What are you talking about, Ray? But by then Marid's body had been lying dead in that sand for ages. Why would I want to do something like that? We're family. Now we're family? Someone shot my little brother in his forehead. Surely it wasn't his own blood. I will kill whoever did that. I swear to God... I didn't shoot Marid. Okay? If it wasn't you, then who was it? And don't lie to me, you know something. Stop this shit now and forget about it. How can I forget about this? You just need to accept that Marid fucked up, okay? He didn't know his place, and he paid the price for it. If you don't cut this out, you're fucking next, okay? You're just a gangster, Nazeem. Am I? Am I! Because if I pull the trigger, you're finished, girl. Then you can join your fucking brother. Sorry, Nazeem. Tell me what happened. - What's going on? - Dad... Nazeem? Nazeem? No! Nazeem! No, please, Nazeem! Please, no! What the fuck? He was going to kill me with this gun. The same one he used to get rid of Marid. Calm down, Ray... It wasn't Nazeem. Then what happened? When Nazeem asked me what to do with the boy, I... I had no choice. I'm not an educated man, Ray... but one thing I've learnt in life... is that nothing hurts as much as love that turns to hate. It wasn't Nazeem? No, my child. It was my decision. Mine alone. I am the King of Atlantis. I need to maintain the respect that I've earned. You knew about this? The drugs... the gangsters, everything? Everything that goes on in Atlantis affects me. Your brother had to pay for what he did. A king must be obeyed. In even the smallest matter. And if you can't even rule your own family... then who else is going to obey you? Amir, that's enough now! No! Now I see... Ra'ida! - You did this to me. - No, Amir... You did this to yourself. It's over.
