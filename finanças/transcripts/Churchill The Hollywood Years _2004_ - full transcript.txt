We shall fight them in our breeches. We shall fight them on the shores. We shall fight them on the land, and in the cities. We shall fight them in the air. We shall defeat this enemy with all that we have. We shall never give in. Come on, guys, you are winding me up, huh? Winston Churchill, one of the greatest British heroes of the century, was actually an American G.I. I mean, that's like, uuuuh... You want a war, Adolf? You got it, pal. We have before us, many long months of war. What these files contain could rewrite history as we know it. I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. Do we really need to dig up our history in this way? I mean, what's it to you? Winston Churchill was my father. Just what the hell are you trying to do, Lieutenant? Kick as much Nazi butt as I can. Sir. Drop the hammer, Fritz! I fail to understand, if this man was Churchill, then who was the man we all thought was Churchill? You know, the old man with the cigar? His name was Roy Bubbles. He was a stooge for the British Government who used him for propaganda purposes. "Roy Bubbles, after-dinner speaker and character actor. Any work considered." That's incredible! That's just the beginning. Blimey, there's ten tons of cod in there. What you gonna do with all that paint, Ron? There he is! Mr. Churchill? Will America come to our rescue? It ain't for me to say, I'm one man acting alone here, but I'll tell you this. I'll do everything I can to stop the Nazis taking over Europe. What can one man do alone, Mr. Churchill? Just give me the tools, I'll finish the job. - What about peace in our time? - I'll give you peace. A piece of Hitler's ass. Thank you very much, gentlemen. It's an honour to be in this great country of yours. - Is that Winnie? - Hey, Denzil! What the hell you doing here? I came to bring your gung-ho ass back to London. - That's the President's orders, sir. - Let's hit it. We got time for burger and fries? I'm starving. This is England, Churchy. Nothing but bangers and mash and warm beer. Ah, shit! Your Sweetie Wheats, Your Majesty. Oh, bugger! Another bloody sub. I have three of these already. Ah, Margaret, there's something we need to discuss. Oh, God! Yes. Yes. You can't go marrying this Hugh Hefner fellow. You're second in line to the throne. It's out of the question. I'm just going to be a Bunny Girl for six months, that's all. Margaret, there are people out there without butter or coal. Oh, don't come the people's princess with me. God, I hate living at home. You know, I wanted to marry a lovely, slim, young flapper girl from Godalming. But one simply can't do that kind of thing. Look, there's a war on. We have to set an example. War? The war with Germany, Daddy. Oh, Lillibet, darling, that was over 20 years ago, you know. - Forgive and forget, what? - This is a different war, Daddy. I think you're being extremely selfish. Our country needs us desperately. Well, you go and fight the Germans, then, Miss Lilly-Perfect-Bitch. Very well. I shall. Headstrong thing, that one. I don't know what I'm going to do with her. I'll get her to marry a Greek or someone. Slap her about a bit. Your Gracious, Divine, Royal Highness. A very good morning to you. Ah... Bendle. A word, please. I want you to take this to the King's bedroom. Place it beside his bed. "Me in Camp F." What's this, a gay prison story? No, it's Mein Kampf. It's by a German. Full of very interesting ideas. Make sure the King sees it. I might do. Mr. President, the British are trapped here in North France. It's game over, sir. America stands alone. Oh, my God. Collect your uniform from section A and report to the War Room. - Next! - I've come to join up. And you're quite prepared to fight for your country? You're aware of the sacrifices involved? Oh... Well, I don't like fights. But I'm quite prepared to ride in cars with other people and share a wing of a house with others, if necessary. Your name? Oh, Jane, er... Common... er- - Jane Commoner. - Yes. Well, collect your uniform from Section A and report to the War Room. Thank you. Have you been a soldier long? Next! Strange girl. Standard! Standard! War in Germany! Standard! Wow! The British War Office. Nerve centre of the Allied Campaign. This er... thing here is erm... is gonna win the war for us, huh? That thing there is the salvation of Europe, Denzil. If what you're saying is true, the Brits are about to make you into a national hero. All the pussy we can get. Don't forget your boy. I'm sorry. What do I do with this fleet here? Just push them anywhere. The trick is to look busy. Ha. All right. I say. A new young filly in the stable. Ooh, what fun! You ought to watch out, Rebecca. This one's a very tasty bit of crumpet. Excuse me, Lord W'Ruff? The third fleet has just sailed into Switzerland. Oh, Baxter, do you mind? I'm taking my tea. Oh, sorry. Must have a tea. - Piss off. - Yes, sir. Lord W'Ruff. - Do I know you? - Lieutenant Churchill, sir. - I have orders to give this to you. - What is it? It's the German Enigma machine, sir. It decodes German signals telling you when and where the Nazis are going to strike next. Really? That's splendid. Well done. What are you expecting me to do about it? Plug it in, turn it on and win the war, sir. Oh, that's very clever. - Win the war? - Correct, sir. How do you propose we do that? Well, by deciphering the codes and feeding back misinformation, sir. Can I borrow that for a second, sweetheart? Thanks. Okay. We land a task force here in Normandy. Then we kick their asses down to Paris. - I think he means arses, sir. - Oh. Then while our boys are driving tanks across Rome and Sicily, Patton's across the Rhone... and he's up the Rhine. Before you can say "Heil Hitler", we got Fritz on the ropes... and Hamburg... in the top pocket. Then it's hello and good night, Berlin. Or you can just hang around here and stick that fruit bun up your butt. Sir. Well, it's very good of you to come all this way, Mr. Churchill, - and tell me what to do with this fruit bun. - No problem, sir. Well, it may not be to you, but... I should have checked my brains at the door, then this guy and I would've been even. I'm sure this whole rotten business will be sorted amicably. We generally win in the end, you know. This ain't the end, princess. And it ain't the beginning of the end. But it's sure as hell the end of the beginning. Auf wiedersehen, pal. What a dreadful man. See that he's deported immediately. Rather. "The beginning of the end, the end of the beginning." What the fuck's that mean? Hell if I know. I just open my mouth and shit comes out. What the hell is it with these guys? They act like they don't want a war. Excuse me. Don't give up on the British people. We need someone like you with spirit and courage to stop those beastly Nazis. Everyone's scared honey, just like the French. But you're not scared, are you? 'Ey, 'ey, excuse me. I'm getting a little parched. You want a beer? We can set the world to rights in the Jeep. Oh, well, I er... Hey, come on. Hang with us... Err, Jane... Commoner. I've never drunk a beer but I'd be happy to sit and watch you have one. A sober Wren? I ain't never heard no shit like that. There you go! Why don't we find ourselves a couple of Cockneys and show you a good time? Take the next right up, Big D, we're going to London's East End. Home of my ancestors. There you go, Jane! I got you. - Ah! God bless you, Mr. McChurchill, sir. - Hey! There's a warm welcome for you in the East End. Will you be having a drink with Jim Jim Charoo? - You better believe it. - Who are all these people? - I've never seen anything like this before. - Where you been hiding out? The Irish Cockneys. The good people of England. Ah, bejesus, simple yeomen and chimney sweeps with hearts of gold. Well, heaven be blessed, at last the Americans are here. Come on, boys, we'll show you some fun. - Hey, come on, Jane. - Oh! You stick with me, Missy. I'll show you a craic! If you want him, young duchess, you best hoick up your dresses and dance for him. Come on here, Jane! Come on! Go on! Dance with your whole heart. Show him your knickers, that's the Fenian way. Let's see you, come on! Yeah! Dance your heart out honey! Let me see you! Jane! Jesus! Sit down! C'mon! - Ow, Jeez! - Don't touch me! I should never have come here! I feel so utterly humiliated. - I didn't mean to hurt you by bringing you there. - Didn't you? Honey, you gotta lighten up. I mean, look at this as a life-learning curve experience, that's all. Oh, you're such a pretentious rotter, you really are! Hey! Such a rotter? Sieg heil. Seek hell to you too, sir. Mein Führer. Welcome to England. Mein Führer, it's such an honour to be the pilot who flies you here on such a top secret mission. A secret that I will not impart to a living soul. Please... let me take your bags. Wh-What a fun evening. We'll soon be there. I promise you. Now... Right. Next stop, London. You, you, go stand somewhere else. You look Northern. You've got to treat your bitch with more respect. That's the difference between what you're talking about. You know? You just got to lighten up. Nah. Why couldn't I just tap into the softer feminine side of myself? Well, cheery-bye, Mr. Churchouse. It really was lovely to meet an American. We all thought you were very amusing. - A bloody good laugh. - Is that right? Now, then. Your boat is over there. Off you go now. Let's hope you're still laughing when you go down the plug speaking German, pal. We actually like the Germans. I think it's far better for everyone concerned if you take your slave and fuck off back to the colonies. - Who do you think you are, man? - Whoa, whoa. No. Don't hit her. That's Hitler's bitch, ain't that right? I have a telegram for you. "The King requests the pleasure of your company for dinner and dance at the palace." Sounds to me like the King finally wants to talk to me about the war. - We're keeping the King out of this. - Shut up! Oh, bloody fuck! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to bump-start it. Bump? Was ist bump? It means that we all get out of the car and then we push it. Not you, mein Führer, of course. Now, perhaps, mein Führer, you can release the handbrake when I say. Now, now, jam it into third and sort of jerk the clutch in out, in out. Oh, and then, then pump up a little gas, but don't flood it, mein Führer. Here we go! Right. Three, two, one, push! Right, let the clutch out, yeah, let... let... Let the clutch out, you bloody idiot. Now! Go right! Go right, you idiot! I mean, mein Führer. God! Oh, it's so ghastly. Here, there you go. - Cyanide pill. - Oh, thank you. A what? So the King of England has got a palace? Yeah, just remember 200 years ago we kicked their fruit butts back into Boston Harbour. Man, that is homophobic. You cannot say that every Englishman is a shirt-lifter. Hello, gentlemen, and welcome to Buckingham Palace. - Don't you look lovely all dressed in white? - You look like a big store on Christmas Eve. Shut up. Keep hold of that. That'll get you a free drink. Back up. Would Your Majesty care for some more "talcum powder"? Ooh, I love talc. Ooh, your maj. If only it was Christmas, you'd be on top of the tree. Do you think it's too much? No, any more lovely, you know, and I'd have to start using your blusher. Oh, here... Here's a car. We'll be all right now. We've got... Hey! If you wouldn't mind... Oh, God! I wish I was dead. Oh, heavens, hello, I'm Princess Margaret. How nice to meet you. What do you do? - We're US Marines, ma'am. - How lovely. We were just having a vote on who has the best uniforms, the Germans or the Americans. I vote you win, hands down. So, er, what's my prize? Prize? I expect you like jazz, don't you? Because I'm black? No. Well, yes, actually. Oops! Come along in, boys. Come on through. You must meet Daddy. He's a little deaf. So you'll have to shout. - You do know I'm a princess, don't you? - Yeah, you said that. It's just that some people actually think I'm a film star. Now, who can I introduce you to? Oh, Prince Ludwig! He owns Austria. These are my American friends. Hey, what's up, partner? How you doing? A'ight. Cool. Daddy. - These two are both American marines. - Hey, dog, you cool? Sir, an honour and a privilege. I thought Lillibet was just having a few chums round for supper. I mean, look at all these chaps quaffing my champagne. I told them two glasses each, then it's pay bar. Have you any idea who these people are? No, sir, I don't, but I understand this must be a very tense time for you, sir. Most certainly is, yah. You see that chap over there. That's his fifth sausage roll. - Shall we pop upstairs and smoke a reefer? - What did you say? Sir, it was my understanding that you wanted to meet with me. I'm sure you're aware that the great people of this nation are anxiously waiting for you to make a move, sir. Move? Oh yes, yes, good idea. As a matter of fact we had a... Knight Frank round on Monday to value the place. You wouldn't believe what it's worth. House prices have shot through the roof round here... particular part of London. Where the hell is Lillibet? Ladies and gentlemen. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Elizabeth ♪ Happy Birthday to you The Germans always look dangerous going forward. But the French defence was diabolical. Moving away from football. German invasion, any thoughts? - Oi! - It'll never happen. Not in a million years. Where to, guv? To London, now! I do apologise, mein Führer. Look, I've taken the liberty of drawing up a-a... Friendship Pact between our two countries. Everything's 100% in your favour, of course. It is you, isn't it? You are him, ain't ya? Ha! My old lady loves your stuff. I must say I did laugh when- when you- when you ate your boots in that film The Gold Rush. Ah, but to be honest, I always found your stuff a bit cold. Fuck off! No, I'm more of a Laurel and Hardy man myself. So er... what you up to at the moment, Mr. Chaplin? I imagine it was all over for you when the Talkies came in. You are wrong, English working person. My boyfriend, he is the Chancellor of Germany. I haven't seen that one. Ha! Good gag. Did you nick that off Buster Keaton? Yeah, I bet you have a right laugh doing them films. Prince Mario of Naples. Your Royal Highness, even this, the largest diamond in the whole of Italy is not more beautiful or more voluptuous than you are on this day. Thank you so much. Have you come far? Prince Hendrik of Denmark. Your Royal Highness. This Egyptian vase once given to Cleopatra is my humble gift to you on your 18th birthday. Thank you. That's very nice paper, did you wrap it yourself? An American, ma'am. Hi. How kind of you. What is it? Stockings. They, er... They go on your legs. Make 'em feel nice and silky. They also look good on the back seat of a Chevy. Ah! Er, Lillibet, could you get the band on, please? They're charging by the bloody hour. - Daddy... - Okay? - All right. - Good girl. - Thank you so much for coming, everyone. - Thank you, everyone. If you could put your... all your gifts, whatnots over there, there's dancing now, okay? It's all change here, mate. What... The 14 goes to St. James. Not at this time of night, mate. If you want to get to St. James', you get the 27 or the 31 to Marble Arch. Then if you cross the road, you get the No. 6 or the 27 to the Strand. Oh, fuck. Or is it the No. 11 you want? No, it's the 144. 144 goes to Edmonton, what am I talking about? No, it's the No. 73. Some of those only go as far as Knightsbridge on a Thursday. Where is the English King? Why is he not here to welcome me? The King is attending to his daughter's birthday, mein Führer. You see, they're having a bit of a ball in there. A little ball... - Er, thank you, Brenda. - Bendle. This is your Royal suite, mein Führer. I do hope the ball won't disturb you. Well, should you want anything, don't be afraid to talk into this horn here. - Now what time would you like breakfast? - Mr. Hitler don't get up before noon. Breakfast stops at ten, I'm afraid. Well, it can start again at two minutes past, can't it? Name, sir? My name is Hermann Goering, you schweinhund. Drive on! Drive! Oh... Waffles! My little Waffles. You little liebchen Waffles. My Waffles, puffly, wuffly, puffly, woof, woof, woof. Waffles, you've been on an aeroplane. Mein glorious Führer. England is yours. Oh, Waffles, look who's here. Say hello to the Reichsmarschall. Sieg heil. Would the Frutrer want any supper before bedtime? Yes. The Führer would like a steak. - Certainly. - With no meat in it. - Now there's a challenge. - It's called a tofu steak. A toffee steak. Right. You better stop taking it up the arse, mate. I said tofu. You don't sound very German. That's because I was born in Leyton. Bormann's the Butchers. The family moved to Frielstrat when I was eight. Now fuck off, or you'll be propping up the autobahn. Hmm! Oh, scheiße! We'll be back in a couple of months. You can take the frame an' all then. Precision bombing, Martin, it's a myth. What do you say we liven this party up a bit, huh? Oh, no, no, no. Not here, man. Oh, yeah. She's lost that loving feeling.

Put that glass down and fuck off. Come on. You heard what the King said. Yo, Church? So... you're a princess? Why didn't you tell me? Oh. I couldn't. It would have spoiled everything. You ought to have a little bit more faith in people, Your Highness. Have you seen that creep they've got lined up? No, Winston, not here. Where is it? Oh. Hey, yo, Winston! Party's over, man. Yo, Church, man. Get your shit together. The party's over. I've had some very nice dreams about you. I've had some real nice thoughts about you too, sweetheart. I must get back to my guests. Oh, my God. Look at that. Well, well, well. Adolf Hitler. I'm proud to say, Hitler's just what this country needs. Over my dead body, asshole. At last you're talking my language. Get him! Get him out! Go on! - What are you doing? Let him go. - You stay out of this. You're gonna burn in hell, man! You and your Nazi friends. - Look at the Princess, she's all fizzed up! - She's been on the Babycham all night. Fellas, stop! This man is an American. He's straight. Get your hand off my ass! Argh! Hysterical bitch! Calm down! Yes, calm down! The people of this great island will never be defeated! Give her a couple of these every three hours. - Right. - That should sort her out. Come on, come on. Open your mouth. Night, night, ducks! It's my friggin' wanking hand. Hmm. The little princess. ♪ Falling in love again... You wouldn't dare! You've had it now, you fat fuck! Sir. Sir. Your special guests are here for dinner. Who? The German Chancellor, sir. He's just invaded France. Good. About time someone did. Very nice to meet you, Mr. Hefner. What can I get you to drink? What's your poison, whisky and soda? Gin and tonic? I do not drink. Glass of champagne, then? I do not drink. - How about some wine? - I do not drink. Jolly good. Well you're a better man than me. Er, a beer for Mr. Hefner. What would you like, you lovely big lump? Two huge flagons of wine, a pig stuffed with a chicken and put a couple of steaks on its ears. Give us a lemonade top. I don't want to get psychotic too early. So I hear you're giving the French a ruddy good seeing to. Good for you, well done. The blitzkrieg has been a complete and utter success. I will be in Paris by June. Well, that's a lovely time of year. Not too hot. And when I have conquered France and subdued the Low Countries, I will invade Russia. Oh, very good. Mein Führer. That's next mate, that's next. Rather you than me. Sounds like awfully hard work. Wine, Mr. Hipster? What an interesting man you are. Tell me, do you have time for any fishing? Lovely spring day like this, almost makes farming worthwhile. Yes, how's Angela? - I was hoping you wouldn't have asked me that. - Why ever not? Because last night on the way home from Borchester she got a parking ticket. I think the idea of the Nazis crossing the Channel is absurd. I mean, now they've got Poland and Czechoslovakia, I think they'll call it a day. We will advance across the Atlantic and conquer America. We will strike here first at Washington. And then we sweep up the Eastern Seaboard to the factories of Philadelphia. And then we sweep inland to the oilfields of Texas. And then we sweep again to California for the oranges. The Führer loves a satsuma. America will crumble like a cookie! Very good! Wonderful. You're a madman! I've suddenly realised who you are. I've seen you in a film. And you had this shoe... and you ate it. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. I say, stay away from this chap, he's an absolute fruit. Chaplin. That's it. Good man, Chaplin. Have a drink. Right. - Come on, you, out! - Take it easy. - Come on! - Take it easy! Oh, you are going to get it. Look, hey, Pitmaster W'Ruff, I don't know if this is about the white girl. I don't know if it's about the song we performed, but that was all improv. - We got better stuff. - Ready... Aim... Wait for it! Wait for it! I'm going to give you a gun each. And then you can make a run for it. That's jolly spiffing of you, old man. - It will be much more fun for all of us, won't it? - Yes. Oh, shoot them in the back! Oh, great! Off you go. I'm going to count up to 20. - One, two, three... - Is this about the weed? That was her shit! Come on, Denzil, let's go! Oh, bollocks! Fire! You stinking English bastards! Tally ho! Incoming! Come on, Denzil, come back. I'm hurt! Come on. Oh, hello! I've bagged a Yankee! Get away from me, you English twat! Oh, God! I'm gonna enjoy this. Mummy! Mummy! Come on, we gotta go, man. - Let's get that plane. - Plane? Oh, how convenient. - Shit! - Go! Go! Go! How many more times I got to save your ass? - I think we've bagged one. - I'm all right! - Get outta here. Head for the plane. - Not without you! I'm okay! Just get back to the States. I wanna fight these guys on my own for a little while. - I'm just the token black guy here? - Exactly! Get outta here, before we run out of clichés. One day I'll be back, Church! Detail unit, Hitler asked me to check the oil, you know, restock the fridge, turn the beds down. - You got soul, man. - Halt! - Won't be more than one minute. - Halt! Was machts du? One more white boy touch me! One more white boy touch me, I swear to God. La, la! Eva! What? I did it for you. It's your favourite outfit! On me, yes. Well, don't worry. I mean I'll wear a dress when we meet the King. Oh, Eva! Eva! You know that I cannot, I will not be seen with you. I am the Führer. The Führer is untouchable. Therefore you do not exist. Verstehen? God! You are so anal! Anal Adolf. - That's what all your friends call you. - I have no friends. Mmm... Don't do that, please. Mussolini shows his girlfriend a good time. Why can't you?

I'm fine. Agh! Are you hurt? Where are you? I'm... I'm okay. I'm near some place called Frothington on the Waddle. Does that mean anything to you? Yes. I went to school with Bubbles Frothington. I know, I'll meet you there at the station about eight o'clock? Honey, you're an angel. So what do we do now, Winston? We're gonna fight 'em, honey. We're gonna fight 'em... on the beaches. We're gonna fight 'em on the landing grounds. We're gonna fight 'em in the hills. And we're gonna fight 'em- Hello? Assholes! Oh! So pretty. Thank you. I am the Führer. I'd like you to know I have a complete set of testicles. One is very pleased to hear that. Now. Your father has invited me to attend the Royal Variety Show to see the famous Tommy Trinder. And I would like you to sit... Oh, Eva! My little sister. Cook. Thing. Hello. Hello, Poo Poo. Now, how much testicles do you got? We fight all the time. Eva, halt! Where are you going? Where I'm appreciated. I am going for shagging a beefeater. Ha! Eva, halt! Eva, here! Eva, don't... Leave him! Eva! Sit! E...! Oh, where's she gone? Mein Führer. Eva, no, it's you... You I want to come to the famous Tommy Trinder show. Princess? Princess? I'd... Oh... Ah... Shit. Chester, quick! Stoke up the Royal Train and take me to Frothington On The Waddle. - Very good, ma'am. - Oh, get the door, Chester. Stoke her up, driver! ♪ Hitler has only got one ball ♪ Goering has two but very small ♪ Himmler is somewhat similar... We don't have to stay if you don't want to. It's just, erm, traditional East End Irish Cockney humour. I get ribbed all the time. Ha! Good man. Hello, it's me, Lillibet. Look, have you heard of Winston Churchill? One second. Yes, Chester? It's your favourite, ma'am. Devilled kidneys and kippers. No, thank you kindly, Chester. I couldn't eat a thing. Very well, ma'am. I shall bring it back later for elevenses. Thank you, Chester. I don't know what you're blinking on about gossiping when you should be shovelling coal. You never said that last night behind the gas works. You was all steamed up as I recall. I was never! I haven't got time for your wanton pleasures, Alfie Trellis. I've half a mind to give you a knee trembler right now. You keep your sticky fingers off my back buns. All right, men. Search the station. - I'll take the first carriage, sir. - Come on, men. Shoot on sight! Ready... Shoot him! So, you win again. It's your turn. And again. Excuse me, Chief. Sorry to interrupt. Message from Otto Karlov: "Permission to commence Operation Stag Night?" Yep. Proceed. - We're closing now, miss. The last train's gone. - Are you sure? That'll be one and six for two teas and a cream bun. Oh, I don't carry money. I'm sorry. Well, it's not coming out of my wages. - This one's on me, honey. - Oh, Winston! I've been sick with worry. All these terrible thoughts going round and round in my head, waiting here for hours, drinking disgusting tea, then she asked for one and six, but that's seven, isn't it? Okay, okay, sweetie. Shh! We need to calm down. We gotta get out of here. - All right. - You're too late, Churchill. Jim Charoo, my Irish Cockney friend. As soon as I heard you were in trouble I came here but... Sandwich? All the roads and fields are blocked by the Duke's men. There's no way out of this. - We're caught in a ring of steel, I tells ya. - I have my train if that helps. Mm! I say, you there, stop! Run, Churchill! Save yourselves. I'm just cannon fodder. - Jim, don't! - Go away with yer! God bless you, Churchill. You mad Yankee bastard! There they go! That's my train. Stop, Chester! Stop! Well done, Chester! Isn't this exciting? Close your eyes, honey. - Help! - I gotcha! Come in. Wow! You, er... seem like you're a mile away. Shall I put on some music? Good idea. You know something? I love you, sweetheart. Jetzt, schnell. Komm doch! You will sign this new accord giving me full control of the British armed forces, and the dissolution of your parliament. - But that was not in our agreement, sir. - You will sign it now, or you will be shot. No other alternatives? You're so fair, sir. Auf wiedersehen, mein Führer. Auf wiedersehen! Chester, where are you? Winnie's been hurt. Chester! - Get the Princess. - What are you doing in my train? Get out! Chester! Chester! Such den zug! Schell! Come along, sir. Can't dilly-dally! Message from Lieutenant Churchill, sir. The Nazis have made it into the King's palace. - Ah! - Good day. You have some scheiße on your shoes. Raus, raus! Mr. President, our boy needs backup and air support. Mr. President, we have an election coming up. Mr. President! The American people want our boy home. You cannot desert Churchill now. I know he's the best we've got, but one man alone cannot beat the Nazis, he needs help. - Sarnie here. - Dried milk again, lads. All right, look Top Trumps again. - Sorry, guys, it's for King and Country. - Sodding joyriders! He's right. Eisenhower? I'm making you a General. You tell Adolf Hitler, I'm gonna kick his ass right across Europe, goddammit! Ja! Ja! Shake the breast board. Oh, that's so bad! I love it! Ja. Ja, I'd like to order a fräulein. - Reichsmarschall Goering! You are degenerate. - I thought you'd gone. All you think about is alcohol and fallen women. Mein glorious, beloved Führer. I-I... thought a little relaxation in a fabulous schloß like this could cause no harm, surely? Ja, you are permanently schloßed. I'd have you strung up with piano wire if I didn't think you'd enjoy it so much! ♪ Falling in love again... - Oh, no stop! - ♪ What am I to do No! Stop it! ♪ Never wanted to You want to ruin me and become Führer yourself, don't you, you schweinhund? Of course not, mein beloved Führer. ♪ Falling in love again ♪ What am I to do Are we still playing sardines? Hello! Is there anyone still here? Turn the bloody lights off, why don't you! You think I'm made of money. God! Turn the heating off. Bloody weather... Where the hell am I? Achtung! Hm. Today at three, we will be married. It will be a perfect marriage between the glorious thousand-year Reich and the British Empire. And by six, you will be installed in a glorious new schloß deep underground in Hanover. Half a mile of reinforced concrete will lie between you and the shops. You will want for nothing. You will have four sons. One every five months. They will be named Adolf, Randolf, Gandolf and little Ralph... who will be our favourite until he gets too big, and then we will have him put down. That's the last of the coal, Chester. I don't know how we're going to make it in this thing. - We've got to make it somehow, sir. - Yeah. English oak, sir. That'll get us there. We got the leg up on them now, don't we, Chester? Very funny, sir. Very good. There will be no intimacy or sex between us. Dr. Clutterstrauss will attend to all of that. You have made a great mistake, Mr. Hitler. I think you're a beastly man and your ideas are beastly. You Germans have behaved abominably in this war and you're the... you're the stinker in charge. And I would never marry a stinker. - Besides, you're far too old for me. - Enough! Our marriage will be joyous and happy. Verstehen? I see the palace, sir. Here we go, Chester. Blood, sweat and toil. Good luck, Mr. Churchill. Win the war for us, won't you, sir? You bet! God Bless America! I wish I was American. How dare you treat me like this! Don't you know I'm second in line to the throne? From what I hear she's the heir and you're the spare. Oh, so rude. - And your hair's dyed. - Get in. - Night, night, sweetheart. - Bastard! Are we still playing sardines, Margaret? I mean, no-one else seems very keen, do they? Oh, shut up, Daddy. Look, I demand a gin and tonic. You're far too old for me. Bormann! Look. I'm so sorry, sir. I warn you. Mr. Hitler is very highly strung. You're a big soldier, aren't you? Sir, this is Mr. Teasy Weasy. He's a... hairdresser. Hello. What on earth are we going to do with you, then, eh? - This. - Ooh... Well, that's what I'm here for. Now let's have a look at this. Now... Yes, I'm not too sure about this. What's this-this quiff? I mean, it's very nice, very young. But how adventurous are we feeling? Hmm? Wouldn't you like a little bit more lift, you know, a little bit more height? More height, I like. Not that I'm short or old. We're going to make you 18 again, Mr. Hilton. Heil Hitler! Chief's got a new bird, so you're surplus. Here's your ticket to Portugal and a thousand marks. Right, okay, Alan. I'm just going to pop this on your head for half an hour. There we go. Now would you like a tea or a coffee whilst you're waiting? I'll just go and wipe your gunk off my hands. Adolf? If I go... Waffles goes too. No! And I want the hunting lodge, you know, the one with the gold taps and the open-top Mercedes. Yes, to the last two but not Waffles. Ja, I want Waffles. I'd rather he was shot than you have him. Then you shoot me too. No! Waffles? You come to Daddy! You... Waffles! Bormann, stop her! I want my Waffles! Mein gracious beloved Führer. I feel I must return to Berlin to ensure your plans for your glorious Third Reich are being carried out. You intend to leave now? On the brink of the invasion? You sneak out like a rat, just when I need you? It seems to be a tad too fluffy. You think that's funny? You gutless coward. You dare to laugh at me, your Führer? I swear you will take months and months to die. - ♪ Falling in love again - Stop it! ♪ What am I to do - Stop! Where is that stinking piece of film? Don't worry, my lovely Führer. It's safe in my schloß. You swine. You rat, you hog! You filth! You pervert! You disgust me! You lowlife piece... Tweezyman, raus, raus! Well, here we are at Buckingham Palace. The magnificent State Room before me festooned with flowers. It really is a riot of colour. A wonderful setting for this joyous occasion. A wonderful day in the history of the Royal Family. The marriage of Princess Elizabeth. Are you going anywhere nice for your honeymoon, then? This year it is the turn of Greece, North Africa and the Balkans. Oh, she'll love that! And now the main north door is opening and, oh, here comes Satan. I mean, Joseph Goebbels... dressed in a magnificent black cloak and horns. Who's that, Margaret? He gazes fondly at the congregation. And removes the cross, the 13th-century crucifix... and replaces it with a live chicken. What a complete arse! Oh, wait. No. Not too much! No, no wait, wait! I still want it to be a little bit... how do you say, you know, fluffy, so... No. Is that fluffy enough for you, pal? - Who are you? - Churchill. Winston Churchill. And it's game over, pal. You haven't the guts to kill me. Ah, shut up and sit down. What's it all about, Alfie? Huh? Did they tease you at school? So you're gonna make the whole fucking world pay? Come on, tell me your story, I'm all fucking ears. Come on, asshole! What is this with you Americans? With the "fucking" this and "fucking" that and "up the butt" and "in the ass". You can't even say this word properly. As the English taught you, it is arse! Arse! Arse! And ja, Sherlock Holmes, I was teased at school. But I got over it. I bricked up the teachers in that school and set fire to it. Well, that's a real nice story, but now it's time for you to kiss your arse goodbye. ...der Führer, wer unser Reich... And here she comes, Princess Elizabeth, gliding effortlessly towards the altar. Now approaching her father, the King. Your mother blubbed the whole way through our wedding. So embarrassing! Now the distinguished German dictator steps forward to take his vows. What do you want? I wish... we had never come to this country. Listen, why don't you get me out of here, huh? Come on. Go get those keys. I'll take care of us both. Ja, but... He's going to marry her. Do you, Adolf Timothy Philip Hitler take Elizabeth Kylie Britney Spears Windsor... I thought you were marrying Hefner. ...to be your lawful wedded wife, to honour and obey you for ever and ever? I do. Okay. I owe you. ...Britney Spears Windsor... ...Philip Hitler to be your lawful wedded husband? Who's paying for all this? ...and obey at all times, under pain of a terrible- Don't go away, gentlemen. We'll be back right after this. Sit back and enjoy the show, Alfie. I think you missed your calling. ♪ Falling in love again ♪ Never wanted to Stop laughing! Stop laughing! - Fall them in. - Excuse me, sir, do you have a warrant? Like that? Try something new, Jerry colonel ass motherfucker. Stop laughing! You will... Not... Laugh at me! Got you! Don't think I'm not here, motherfuckers! Yes! Oh, Winston, you gorgeous thing! Honey, I'm home. Drop your toolies. Ain't nobody leaving this bitch! Come on! Here we go! Come on! Ein, zwei, drei. - Oh, where are you taking me? - To Germany in a submarine. - Ain't you Adolf Hitler? - You're Adolf Hitler, ain't you? Oi, mate! I'll vote for you. Margaret? Ain't you Hitler? Where do you get your hair done? Dewhurst's? Ah, come on now, show us your toes, lady. Out of my way, you Irish Cockneys! There he is. Where is my submarine? Where are they? Can you see anything? Yeah. I got a clear shot. I see him. Ah, shit! Shoot him! I can't do it. Oh, nonsense. It's like shooting grouse. Pull the trigger and I'll wring his neck. I never killed a man in cold blood, honey. Oh, don't be so wet! I'll nail the Jerry bastard. - Hey, don't be crazy! What are you doing? - Let her go. - She took my goddam gun! - Right, Winston, it's no way to defend justice. You can't be judge, jury and executioner at the same time. It's not the American way. You'll never get to be president on that policy. Your decadence depresses me. - Darling, you ain't seen nothing yet. - Mr. Hitler? It's me, Lillibet. I'm coming out. I've decided I will marry you. Oh, don't do it. She'll make your life a living hell. Let her go or I'll blow your other motherfucking ball off! See what I mean? Sounds to me like it's all over, Alfie. Nah! Your finest hour's over, mate. Ah, the Luftwaffe. Now do I get to be president? You okay, honey? You got a little scratch. Oh, Winston. God save the Queen. Listen up, people of Britain. - So is your Royal ass all right? - God, do I need a gin and tonic. - The battle is upon us... - Go faster, Bormann! But we shall not fail or falter. We shall not weaken or tire. Nor will the long trials of vigilance and exertion wear us down. And if our Empire lasts a thousand years... people will still say, this was our finest fucking hour! Arise, Sir Winston Churchill. So what happens now, Winston? Maybe some day... in another life we'll meet again and things can be different. But... right now, the world can never know how we feel about each other. Just has to be our secret. I know. But I love you... and I always will. You'll always be my little princess. Ma'am? Er, your next appointment's waiting. Thank you, Sir Winston. And good luck with your endeavours. Thank you, ma'am. Hey, what you doing with that Spitfire? I'm taking it to the Battle of Britain, baby. Let's hit it. Never in the history of this island has so much been owed by so many to so few. All our thoughts are with the courageous airmen, who bravely defend these shores day after day, night after night, in this, our battle for Britain. Look at that, Margaret. I think the fellow's pissed. The Prime Minister will see you now, gentlemen. But that is just so not going to happen. It's just about the most minging country it's been my displeasure to visit. What I want to know, sir, is what happened to my father? Well, as far we know, Lieutenant, he died tragically but heroically in the Battle of Britain. He was lost over the Channel and was not seen again. Well, if he died a hero, how come Roy Bubbles gets all the glory? I know, that is awfully unfair, but hey, you know, life sucks! Well, it's time your people learned the truth. Maybe for your mother's sake... you may want to keep this to yourself. My mother? My mother died 12 years ago. I received... this... today. You might want to, er... swing a little look. So what happens now, Winston? I don't know. I'm just a soldier and you're going to be a queen one day. But I don't want to be Queen. I want to be an American woman, like you. Well, what do you say? You wanna... You wanna marry me? Yes. Oh, Winston! Dad. Your finest hour is about to come. God bless America. Mother? Mother! All right, I admit it, it was a cover-up. But let's be clear about this, you know, the same cover-up has been going on all the way through history. You know, Francis Drake, Charles Dickens, Charlie Darwin, even Shakespeare, huh? They were all American too. - Shakespeare was American? - Yeah. Born in Nebraska, son of a cattle rancher. Wrote his first plays by 16, The Merchant Of Idaho, Two Gentlemen Of Texas, then at 20, moves over here to Stratford. The rest is history. And action, Nev. Your gracious, divine Royal Highness. A very good morning to you. Er... Beadle? Er, Bendle. Oh, Ben, I never get your name right. I want you to take this to the King's bedroom. Make sure he's in bed... Oh, fuck. Why are you choosing now to have such a mid-life crisis? Eva, my strudel, relax, this is for the good of Germany and the world. Don't strudel me. If I go, so does Waffles. No! I want Waffles, the hunting lodge, you know the one with... Okay, I can't take it any more! Very well. I shall. Waffles, you fetch! Oh, Waffles! Fetch! Waffles. Oh, no, Waffles. Waffles, no. I'll fetch, Waffles. Cut. Chief's got a new bird, so you're surplus... Again, sorry. Keep running. - Chief's got a new bird, Harold, fuck it! - Still running. Harold. - Still running. - Oh, my gawd. Sorry. - And again. - Method. So, should you want anything, please just talk into this horn here. That's my mobile phone, I do apologise. I'm going to make you 18 again, Mr. Hilton.
