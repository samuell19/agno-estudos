Catching up is hard. It takes a lot of concentration. Yes, you can train for it. But even the training takes a lot of concentration. Especially under pressure. And when you're catching up you're practically... Attention pilot! You are entering the contaminated zone! Put on your oxygen mask! Put on your oxygen mask! See, it's possible. Faith can move mountains. If you give yourself the necessary push. Now the comrades will brag about how they messed up. The radical sentences they wrote and how much they've risked. I didn't write a single word. Me, Hille Wawra, the empty page. But who does, when all hope fails, and he still wants to get ahead and still achieve tenure and eat crabs with his radish and buy musical instruments for his talented kids and read his Berthold Brecht for two hours each day under his own lime tree and still be a decent guy to all he does not like and swallow everything and forget all consideration and stand on his left leg and then on his right leg and always keep the goal in sight who does, under these circumstances that claim his day and night where your own opinion costs more than it's worth under these circumstances left by Chlorophyll and spring who has a sense for beauty and significance and for the sensuality of an empty, pristine mythical white page. Okay, sure thing start fresh, tackle things one by one identify problems, be methodical, catch up, reel in, overtake. The path is clear. If I approach it systematically. Where there's a will, there's a way. Yes Dad, thy will be done, it's probably about time. Why give up, just because it's hopeless? No surrender, yes Dad. You even faced the Fuhrer. Saved your bells throughout the war. Found a new home for your family. And never turned in an empty page. Hille, is that you? How was the exam? It was about chromosomes. I didn't worry. With biology, I thought, you'd do fine. It's not like it's Latin. And after all the help of Dr. Merkheimer, I figured you'd do fine. The trick is to be passionate about something, like father with his bells. During the war, the Fuhrer requisitions them, after the war, he is driven from his home. And today his old, Silesian bells ring in his new parish. How father managed that or how Dimuth did. That would be great. My sister just leaves, because she knows she'll make it and then she does. Today, people in a metropolis are crazy about her. She's a star. And never graduated high school. Really? No one ever took your picture? With your looks? Impossible. Come over here. Come over here! ...you'd be great, I can tell. I've taken pictures for years, especially in this field sensual photography. This could start your career. Get you exposure. With your looks. The photo is the beginning, Dimuth, the stepping stone. Dimuth was always the greatest. But the photos also created trouble. But without the fight, she would never have gotten out. Here we go! "Suggest solutions for overpopulation?" "Gas them!" Pletsch! Weber! Disrespectful pack! 5 more minutes! Hey, Hille, heard from your sister? Dimuth took Rome by storm. Has a great career and forgets all about us. Even though I discovered her. Yes, young man? I'll take these Latin translations? Let's see – The pocket size probably? Exactly! They have helped many graduate. I'll take all of them. Sure. Now you're set. Thanks. Your change. Hello? Hey young man? Forgot something? That way you'll never graduate. Thanks! Your schedule must be flexible. If you don't finish your Latin in one day, you have to reschedule. Our inherent guilt must be overcome. Thanks. It would be wrong to worry about every minute spent without your nose in a book. You’d be the slave of your own schedule... See you later! Relaxation is as important as concentration. Hey, schoolboy? Wait, I have to call my husband. Yes, please? Honey, can I tell you something? Darling, I'm overworked as it is. Too bad, the boy is really cute, and very enterprising. Sibylle, listen to me... Okay, then not. Too bad. I'm just not in the mood for erotic games right now. So please... Sibylle? Sibylle, can you hear me? Hello. Are you in bed already? I'll tell you later. Bye! Who is it? Sibylle? My husband has so much trouble with his company. People are way too nervous these days. How did he get in? Who does he think he is? Anna! Quick, get Anna. You're not even safe in your own home. Guys, come quickly. Ready? Let's go! Dump the trash in his garden! Come on! Open the gate! Madame, please come! Dump all. Fuck him. Shut up, grandma! He'll know why. Grab her, grab her! You'll all go to jail when he gets back. He'll apologize to us. Good day, Madame. We're the reprobates. Grab her, grab her! You'll all go to jail! Locked away! To think about what you've done. That's animal cruelty! Break down the door! It's too late. Call the police! So cruel! If they were human, they'd have survived somehow. But the poor animals never had a chance. Take away their license. But we have to do something. Call the police. They're all dead! I know the owner. She's out of town. She's visiting her dying brother. She asked a student to look after her store. If I get my hands on him. He's worse than a murderer. One should let him die of thirst. Very slowly so he knows how that feels. Please let me through. I would break the door down. But that would be destruction of property. But it's justified! Without the right key you never open the door. That's the young man! Frau Meier told you to look after the animals! He has the key. That's him. But he promised Frau Meier. Criminal! Murderer! Let go! Go outside! Get out of here! You dirtbag! We won't let him get away! I won't leave before he goes to jail! He does not even care! Look at him! No remorse! I've never seen anything like it! It's your fault! Dimuth also had her share of problems. At least in the beginning. Her real success didn't come until she got to Rome. That's how it goes, you stumble with every step. You just have to persevere. I wouldn't want to be popular with everyone. The downside of being popular is: Disappointing someone. I'd be totally embarrassed. Better not to create expectations, then people will be pleasantly surprised. But you also have to be lucky. Do the right thing at the right time. And that's what I'm the least good at. No! That's impossible! Our daughter! Dimuth! Come here! You godless, pathetic thing! You'll kill her! Leave! Get lost! Friends, let's not get nervous. But if we don't act now, it will be too late, Reverend. Once before the church has... I'm not planning on making a statement. The bells belong to the Silesians. Right, not to the church. Definitely not to Bonn. Right, because chancellor Brandt is a traitor. It's five to twelve. If not later. Hanging two Silesian flags left and right, would be okay with me. And a big banner. From here to over there. We can't forget our Silesian homeland. Mother Silesia, we stand by you. Good day, Reverend. Good day, Mr. Ondix. Sounds wonderful already. Should we try together one more time? Soprano and bass – And pronounce the final syllables. Speak clearly. Oh, if I had a thousand tongues, And a thousand mouths. I'd sing with them in unison From deep in my heart. Okay, let's take it till here. Does somebody volunteer to get the Silesian flags off the steeple? Who volunteers anymore? Youths? Thanks. We'll continue. That's nice of you. You tell him. Just ask him. Hille, will help us get the flags? Roswitha will be pleased. Don't be a coward! Well? Gabi, but you'll come! No. If you don't, I won’t either. Don't be stupid. Just go! But don't stay too long. Hille, where are you? I'll piss down on you. You can't. You won't. See, there it comes. Do you already have to? No, doesn't work. Oh shit, your dad. What is this? I'll show you! You should be ashamed! And you, come here! I won't do it again. Opening your fly in front of all these people, you little bastard! I'll lock you up the steeple. No, I don't want to go under the bell! But opening your fly is fine with you? Sit here until the bell tolls. Careful! My glasses. Now we are all alone. But promise not to do anything! No, they're waiting for us. But I'm not doing anything to you. Am I? What now? What am I supposed to do here? I'm not doing anything to you. My glasses! What if my uncle sees this? What am I doing now? I'll pay for new ones. Now this hellish noise again. Every 15 minutes, for years now. Come here young man. Ask your father, why he is doing this, hasn't he heard of human rights, we still have a constitution. If this noise continues, I will personally sue him, I'll finally take legal action. Tell him. He refuses to see me. Fine, I'll tell him. You certainly should. As a Christian, he cannot ruin the health of his fellow man. Terrible, these bells. My nerves are shot. In B! Pay attention! Three, four. Don't worry. I can wait. Mr. Director. So good to see you. Same here, Reverend. This is my son. My wife has told me a lot about you. He's studying all day. We'll sponsor your celebration, even though we're under financial pressure ourselves. But we won't abandon old friends. All this empty land over there and here we are crammed in like sardines. And rents are going up. The nursing home is overcrowded. We're doing what we can, Reverend. Old people don't cough because of bad air, but because they're old. And if the slander continues, we'll simply close shop. We are a big company, it will be done in no time. Okay, Reverend. Are we clear? Yes, of course. Thanks. I didn't mean it like that. And thanks again. Goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, you know that this is the last lesson before our Latin exam. We live in a meritocracy which expects more and more achievements from us. Most of you have realized this and have performed accordingly. So far so good. But every class has someone in it who makes his teacher question his own profession. But you all can attest that I did what I could. I have repeatedly warned you that Latin, like all good things in life, does not come easy. For years I preached that you should not fool yourself when it comes to Latin. Who is to blame for the fiasco coming upon him? Those concerned should ask themselves, if they have the courage, if they were not just lazy but also spineless. Which would not surprise me. Not at all. Oh, you're already here? Hi, Hille. I would have picked you up but I'm really stressed. No problem. So close to exams. This time it has to work. I can't stay in school forever. It's only a matter of concentration. A test of will, nothing more. I've developed a great method: Learn with a metronome. Strange that nobody thought of it before. Learn rhythmically, you know? Then you can increase the pace. Learn more, but faster. You have still not graduated? This time, it can't go wrong. I planned it exactly. With work allotted for every day until then. Monday... Tuesday... So. My God, Hille and I've always thought you might finally succeed. Can I borrow 50 Marks? What? You don't have any money? Money? Forget it. Hi, Dimuth. Should I prepare a bath? What's the area code for Rome? I got it. Daddy, tell me. For Rome? Tell her if she wants to know. I'll fill the tub. 00396 Hello? I'm so happy that we're all together again. Don't you think? Yes, Hille? Good morning! I knew from the start there would be trouble. We were just sitting down to eat. If he doesn't lose his appetite. He cannot let this stand. Reverend, there’s trouble. Haven't you read? You can't stay out of this. Please come in, my friends. We have to stick together. Nobody knows what to do. I'd prosecute them! Look, Reverend. The Poles have more national pride than we do. "Eastern rider, Wawra rides for Germany." And on a bell. Blasphemy. Yes, Reverend. The disaster is closing in. We have to defend ourselves. Just stupidity and ill will. We are being sold out. This is not just about Silesia, but about Germany and European freedom. Reverend, I really can't go on practicing. You have to. The celebration is on Sunday. But I'm nearly deaf. We have to do something. We have to act now. So I was a member of the "master race" What will remain of Silesia? Reverend, I'm sure you did not do these things. Great to read something like this about one's father. They give everything away. Travel agencies write Wroclaw instead of Breslau. West German travel agencies. Just to make nice. Did somebody ring the doorbell? Hille, where are you? One moment. Yes. Hey, everything okay? Hey, Hille. We've been waiting for ages. You promised us, if needed, we could get into the steeple. Now is the time. What do you think? The Left has to start preparing. Which is what we are doing. But we need a safe place to plan some political actions. A place that secures the element of surprise. According to Regis Debray, that's the basis of our strategy. When will we get the keys to the steeple? Would be nice to work efficiently. The Left has to learn to defend itself. We must train systematically. Make sure that nobody sees you go in. You'll get in, but maybe not out again. A place with one entrance can be a trap. Don't forget: the enemy is everywhere. They are all in it together. That's what we try to find out. You see, the Reverend prohibited a scientific commission from entering the nursing home. People are starting to talk. Why a harmless medical examination is being prohibited. Big business must be behind it. Nobody shall know how poisoned our air is. An industrial city is no spa. Nobody said it was. Let's stay objective, shall we? Friends of ours live in the nursing home, that's why we care. Let's talk to the reverend first. The church cares for the industry. Not for us. Why the elderly? They don't care about your political stuff. Let the elderly be. And suddenly you're in the middle of the forest, You smell fir trees. You practically hear the birds sing. Dimuth! What a surprise! A can of compressed air for 5 Mark 80. Hi Uli. 5 – 70 – 80 Goodbye. Well, Dimuth? Can we talk? One moment? I believe your film has arrived. Walter... Yes, that's it. I dared to take a look. Beautiful colours. Great shots. Great, the new Super 8 Want me to screen it? Sure. I have a new projector in my studio. Please, come on in. You're coming? There it is. Small but great. Bought it especially for my customers. Let's switch it on and it's ready to run. See, it has an autoloader. Put the film in at the front and it comes out at the back. I also sell these projectors. So, did you film more beautiful rats? Sorry, this time it's fish. They used to be fish. They are dead now. If fish could scream, they would have done so for 5 to 6 hours straight. That's how long it took for them to die. That's practically hydrocyanic acid. Roughly what the Nazis used in the concentration camps. And once again everybody's innocent. Or they blame it on a few poor garbage men who cannot defend themselves. So what did you want to tell me? Can I borrow some money? I'm owed 50.000 Lira for a commercial, but until it arrives... - Well, why not? We can talk about it. Here comes the funny part. Saving Jakob the swan. Come to my place tonight. - That's me. I had to save him because he has a tumour on his neck. His kind expelled him. They are like humans that way. So, what about tonight? No, please, I don't want to anymore... The animal was pretty wild! But I'm sure you didn't act like a nun in Rome? Have you already forgotten me? Let me go. There! He bit me! You can clearly see it. Powerful beak. Let me touch you! Hands off, you scumbag! That's my mother. And my aunt Else. This is our kitchen. I haven't seen you for so long. Come over for a glass of wine some time. Sure, why not? He won't last long, if you ask me. Cyanides are no picnic. See, this is his tumour. I also got it in close-up. Dimuth! There's the tumour again. I don't know if I can save him. My mother was afraid of the swan. Come children, let me tell you about our bell celebration. The bells in the steeple used to ring in our homeland. We Silesians loved out homeland. And when the bells ring, we remember it. How beautiful it was. That's why on Sunday we will ask God to lead us back there. Okay, take your positions. Come on. Work with me! Bells, take your positions. The Small Laudamus and Big Berta. This way, like we practiced. Small Laudamus right, Berta in the middle. And Kunigunde to the left. Okay kids, quiet now. Who is Kunigunde's voice? Is she around? Make yourself known. Me, me, Reverend. I'll be her voice. And I'll speak Big Berta! Then step in front of your bell. I hung in Gleiwitz for 300 years, ringing for fortune and danger. They ripped me down in winter, to melt me into cannons. Very good. Now Berta... Not here. Berta is over there. I hung in Gleiwitz for 400 years, then I was moved to Hamburg. Amid 1000 other bells. And not allowed to ring. Wonderful. Now you. Stop, stay with your bell. During the war I was taken... That's not how it starts! In Gleiwitz I was... off the steeple... Kleber here. Yes, please? This is Wawra. - Yes, Hille. What's up? No. Reverend Wawra. - Excuse me? Sir...because my son... Who is this? - Well, you know... He has now... He what? ...became sick. He cannot take the Latin exam... Sorry, I don't understand... Your father is sick? No, my son is. This is all very confusing. He can't... you understand... Keep in mind how important the exam is. Young man, the summons is in the mail. Tell this to your father. I'll see him in court. This is irreversible. I was patient long enough. And then a bell celebration. But that's over now. Okay, I'll tell him. I asked for a temporary injunction. Ah, there is your true nature, the apple does not fall far from the tree, like father, like son. Nothing will change. Egoism, brutalism. And doom is closing in. It's quite possible that rats will rule our planet one day. And they will experiment on us. We are on our way there. There are many examples of species extinguishing itself. Ask any biologist. Humans have problems surviving in the environment they changed. But rats do it well. In our civilisation more dirt means more revenue. I can see it at my purification plant. It's not just the excrement of 10,000 households. Two giant slaughterhouse dump their shit there. Let alone all the industrial waste. And the rats thrive. Really well. And not just the rats. Worms, bacteria, insects. They can change generations in 5 to 7 hours these days. Can't we talk about something else? Life is full of beauty. Why always talk about those subjects? Hille, get some more nuts for our guest, will you? Let me give you some money. But I remember there being 50 Marks? I'm really sure there were 50 Marks in there. Where could the money have gone? It's us. The situation became more acute. You need the keys? We need to hide an army deserter. I still have to learn math. I'll swing by later. Don't overextend yourself. You'll fail anyway. Come on in. Reverend, it makes no sense. I got this humming in my ear. My whole head hums. I trust you with this. - We brought the materials. Lots of good stuff. - Then we can start. We're counting on you. With this, I could blow up the cathedral. It's falling apart on its own. Hille? Join us later? If you haven't blown yourself up by then. Did you find your money? Your teacher called me earlier. You should be ashamed, lying to your teacher. You're lucky that your father is so busy. Maybe I'm sick... - Why? Maybe I'm genetically a criminal. What? Some signs point to me having two Y-chromosomes. That would be twice the normal male disposition. Many criminals have two Y-chromosomes. Did you take the 50 Marks from my pocketbook? Can't this wait until later? The stores will be closed then. Now my hearing aid is completely broken. B! Mr. Baier! - I simply can't do it. Beethoven was also deaf, Mr. Baier! But I'm no Beethoven. We are well aware. - Then stop torturing me. Hille! Don't shout. But it's important. What's up? Roswitha can't stay with her uncle anymore. It's your fault. He said I was just like my mother. And then he tried to molest her. But Roswitha, if I wasn't so busy at the moment. I'm under a lot of pressure. Can Roswitha at least leave her suitcase here? See Roswitha, right now it's all about you. But look at the world around you. Traffic accidents, torture, thousands of kids starving. If you look at all that... Do you still even like me? Of course, you know that. Her uncle wanted to rape her. Yes, but you can't stay at the rectory. ... Roswitha, come, we'll see you later. It will be okay, Let me figure it out. Chin up! I'll make it work. I'll figure it out. Later, okay? Those were weapons, clean and silent. People who can't handle a knife should not be handed a gun. And done! If the box doesn't work now, I'll smash it against the wall. These days the cowards want to poison civilians with bacteria. No soldier should stand for that! A few hours and the clock works. The timer. With this, I'll blow up everything. At the exact second... - And your first target? The cathedral, of course. The first political action to blow one up. The smell here! Damned murderers! He has not cleaned up after himself. Ugh! Next time you empty the shit-bucket. Better shit than Molotov-cocktails. Snow faintly falling. I find sitting in the steeple quite symbolic. Are we changing anything? Any contact to the outside world? Does anyone know who we are? They will talk about us once the bomb goes off! And boom! As long as there's a bang. No deeper thinking needed? From the beginning a lack of analysis. No wonder you fail in practice. You should have analyzed your own needs first. Bragging first and then doing nothing. One has bombs, the other biological weapons. And now they're big shots. Individual actions have always hurt our cause. The garbage strike is going strongly. But, Hille, that's just 50 guys. The working masses have to strike. Here a bomb, there a bomb. That's kid's stuff. The vulnerable points are the water and electricity plants. If we can't wait, our actions will fail and only amuse the bourgeois. I always hear wait, wait. While down there the garbage men get beaten up. The last humanist. How romantic. It's true! Go and get yorself beaten up, too. Poor asshole. You have to admit that not every moment is the perfect one to start. - He just wants to delay us. I've had it. Sometimes I think the police sent him. With the pretty hippie-look. If he gets on my nerves again I'll throw him off the steeple. If we start fighting now – - Come you asshole, you are not any better. He thinks he's got the army by the balls. I can practically dictate my demands. How so? He wants to prove that they have biological weapons. He stole a can of Black Death bacteria. How much do you need to kill one human? A millionth of a gram. We can't stay up here forever. The longer we wait, the worse it all gets. What else could we do? I'm not going back to school, and bow to the system by graduating. The teachers don't understand. They all think I went to East Germany. None of you showed solidarity and also quit. Otherwise we'd have an alternative graduation up here. Danger! Danger! You millions, I embrace you. What are you doing, you idiot? Bring the can in or I'll smack you. It's probably just a dummy! Let's try it out. Depending on the wind, half of Germany could be dead. You really think this can could change the world? You have no idea what could happen. This is no toy. Let's ring the big bell and let it rain down. Bring it back, dammit. In the corner and no more touching! Put it up your ass. It won't be you who goes to jail. We are complicit. But he won't change a thing. Or do you think they'll change their strategy for him? Just assume we would be very disciplined. And just use it for blackmail. They would take counter-measures. So that we can't even strike. Bacteria Clostridium Botulinum. Death rate 60-70%. Danger of inhalation. Poli, drop it. If somebody hears you'll be caught right away. He will rain fiery coals and burning sulphur. Hille, would you be so kind and give your father a message? This is our new base commander, General Fuchs. We both want to help with the celebration. It's possible for him to sent 800 troops to your father's bell celebration. Would you tell him, please? Have a nice day – let's go. Bye! Uli, Wawra is here! Come in. - Hello! Hey, Wawra! I'm really busy. On my own, without help, fighting big money. I found an old grammar book. All these things in there. What you're seeing is how big business ruins our water. "For evil does not come out of the dust, or trouble out of the earth but trouble is man's fate from birth" From the book of Job. And we call this drinking water. Profit for a few, filth for all. Mama! I want to show you something. Mama! Can Jakob see visitors? Uli, did you see Ms. Weibel? She didn't show herself yesterday. No. Come, I'll show you our sick Lohengrin. Hey, Jakob! His death will also be on their conscience. If only I had a mud sample from the canal. But they won't let me on factory premises. I know the director. Maybe I can help? That would be great. If he dies from the tumour, I'll serve him to the director. As Sunday dinner: tumour swan seasoned with cyanide. Prepared by way of the company. Over here, Heiner! A gas-main is polluting mother nature. Where do you want to go? - To India. To India... Crazy. Hitchhiking to India. Well, look who's here? Look who's blocking the road again? Our director! Maybe he wants to give us a tip. No, he wants to apologize. Maybe confess that we are not to blame for this mess, but his company is. Mr. Director, die illiterates can't find the dump. It's humming again. Doesn't work. Sibylle! Open up Sibylle! It's me! I know you're in there! Pretty crumbly, your cathedral. Like flaky pastry. No matter where you touch. There. You see? I never thought it was that bad. Try it. You can break it all off. You can't do any more damage. My God! That's the sulphur dioxide. If you don't act soon, you can offer your cathedral to a Kindergarten. As a sandbox. I've had it! I'm just a fragile human being! All my fault! I'm pulling the plug! Leonhard! Mr. Grabowski, I'm sorry. I did not want to scare you. You brutal person! Stay away! Don't come closer! No, don't beat me! Is Mr. Walter in? Come on in, don't be shy. I'm sitting on my ass, examining your filth. Let me see. There are two others. Even the rats die from this stuff. But I'm going to get you gangsters, even if my hair turns grey. Now the snake plants are also dying. One by one. Why even bother. It takes the fun out of it. Working day and night and for what? Careful. Sorry. I never complained. Hi Dimuth? Have you settled in yet? It looks good on me, too. Don't you think? Have you seen the doctor, Elisabeth? No. Hello Hille What do you think we get together? Talk a little? Maybe going out for a drink tonight? When do you have to retake the exam? Tomorrow. No, Monday. You can't do that. You'll fail again. It's been four days now. Mrs Weibel? Can you hear me? Mrs Weibel! We haven't seen you for so long. Mrs. Weibel! Please answer me. Should we call the police? There's the reverend. Good evening, friends! Here's the newest insult. Let him first catch his breath. There's room at the table. I think this is slander. Let's see. Good evening. This is just to rile them up. Read him the pamphlet. You do it, Otto. You're better at it. He'll have to hear it at some point. Read, Otto. "The Song of the German Bells – Silesian version When the Fuhrer took the bells from their churches during the war, the clerics were inconsolable. That's what we read today. But many Germans like Reverend Wawra gave them willingly, to turn them into cannons. In January 1940 he mounted his dignified Silesian belltower, and blew a French horn to say goodbye to the Swastika-adorned bells. Where is the part about Silesians? "The charity of our spiritual leaders was so great, that the Fuhrer could not turn all bells into cannons." We all know that this is a lie. The part with the cannons was unnecessary. "This is how, after the war, there were 10,000 cannons left at the storage site, where the preachers found them due to divine intervention." This is a love letter to Moscow... ... clearly new Soviet foreign policy! "Maybe Reverend Wawra wants to offer up his bells once more to use the new cannons to re-conquer his old homeland." I've been doing this for 35 years. The reservation was for 3 seats. At this table. We are good customers like everybody else! He did not want to sit with the Reverend. I can sit where I want to! She did not want to sit with the Reverend. And don't you deny it! Don't start with politics. If Silesian or not, a guest is a guest He just has to behave. May I sit? - Yes, please. You all did a number on me. But that about the gas chamber is no laughing matter. I never denied my past. Compared to what the pharmaceutical industry does today, our racial heritage project was harmless. It was meant to improve our hereditary disposition. We didn't do it for profit. We had idealistic motives. Maybe you were just unlucky. This is all too complicated. If I want to know, how a man is in bed, I watch how he eats. Now I won't dare eat in front of you. This is the high life. Darling, you're so funny. I can't help myself. Hey, kid. Let me pass. Well, Hille. Women like their men confident. It's bad if you have troubles. I don't mind modern lifestyle, we should enjoy ourselves to the fullest and one’s erotic life should not have limits. Exchanging sexual experiences, swinger ads, switching partners, I'm okay with all that. I'm not a small person, but it should not be directed against a partner – otherwise, where's the fun in it? Life would not be worth living. How can your personality grow, if it's put under too much pressure? It's the same with capitalism. Why do they want to slow our momentum with rules and regulations, with pressure from the outside? Technology has always regulated itself. They just have to let us, without slowing us down. Hille, if you need reinforcements against the teachers, I can bring my policemen. "Homeland, Homeland Eternal Homeland Homeland, Homeland Eternal Homeland" But... This is terrible. Now you need mineral water just to make coffee. Hello Hille? Let's not talk about Latin today? The cake is a little fresh. I hope you like it. I once heard the way a man eats... Yes, Hille... Something you wanted to tell us? Me? No. Sorry, coming through. Oh my God. One can't even eat in peace. Where are the pennants? Harald stole my pennant. Kids, let's go over there. Wait until we call you, okay? Good morning, Reverend! Good morning! - Good morning. Kids, shush! We have set up. One moment. Oh, our guests. So nice of you to come. Well, Reverend, we wanted to personally introduce ourselves. Beautiful. Just like in the homeland. Nice to have a Silesian girl on my arm once again. Sorry, could I use your phone? Sure. No time for family anymore. Are you looking for someone? Sorry for the interruption. We are looking for Hille Wawra. What's this about? It's a police matter. Your son is involved with a deserter. Why would you think that? - It is like this: The deserter has deadly biological weapons in his possession. But that's impossible. Please wait outside, I'll get my son and send him to you. As you can see, it's pure chaos here today. I'll send him to you, just wait please! Oh my! But it could be worse. I'm just so nervous today. Here's the rest of it! - Thank you. Please darling, just wait until I get there. I'll be back this evening. No, darling. I'm in the reverend's apartment. A nightmare of a place. Unbelievable, but true. And everywhere people in traditional costumes. Around five... Hille, the police is looking for you! Dimuth! Please not today. Your father has been looking forward to this. Oh, my. All my animals are dead. All dead. Mr. Wawra! You promised to take care of them. See what you have done! Mr. Wawra, stop! We need a moment of your time. Think of what you're doing. Don't become an accomplice. He's still wearing all his clothes. He probably got drunk and fell in. He seems to be dead. I can't watch anymore. Call an ambulance! Fast! Go, daddy, go! Is your husband home? - Yes, please come this way. Reverend! Reverend? We raised the flag for your celebration. You greet them alone. I'm not in the mood. It was your idea! Mr. and Mrs. Merk, we are happy to finally meet you in person. Good morning, Dr. Raucheisen. We quickly have to take part in a celebration. Would that be an imposition? No. I'll just sit next to your wife. It won't take long and then we go to our place, if it's okay with you. - Sure, that's why we're here. Ah, Fritz. Back from jail? Greetings, comrades! Mingle and don't be too obvious. Don't loiter here too long. "Matches, matches, girls have snatches. Boys have a jumping jack, girls like to pull it back." Mr. Wawra! A moment, please! You better talk to us. Mr. Wawra! Hille, wait. My uncle wants to talk to you. Young man. Roswitha is my niece. Uncle Heinrich, let him be! Well, then have your fun without me! ... and we met that goal in time. And you call that revanchist? When one does not give up his homeland? I resent the German networks ignoring our homeland. Do you also want so go to Silesia? - Why would I? No! No! None of us should answer. Come over here! Guys, you should run! The police is after you. No need. The bomb is already ticking. And then it goes boom. - You must be kidding. Depends on your sense of humour. But you can't. Especially today. We'd get holiday pay. - Eugen, you can't be serious? And suddenly it goes boom. -You're completely crazy. Tell me immediately where the bomb is. Try to find it – - You are insane. What does your daddy's bible say? Better to pull your eye out, than to die completely. My father wanted to let you perform in church. But others don't like beat music. Don't worry. Happy holiday! Mr. Wawra! Don't work against us. Should we? You could regret it. Hille, listen! Your fly is open. Mr. Wawra! Look what you have done. All the birds are dead. You can't just run away. The poor bird. That was you. You just wait, boy! Good morning, Lieutenant! Good morning, Reverend. Watch out! They keep on coming. Let's go. Like the Middle Ages with the Huns invading. This is a disgrace. Let me go, you pigs! Pull his pants down. - Let go! Come Leonhard, this is terrible. This is a disgrace. Communists! Join your friends outside. You're not welcome here. Ah, the preacher's daughter! Miss Deadly Sin goes to confession. Battleship Potemkin takes the cathedral! We don't have to put up with this! But you put up with it! - What should I do? You have a gun! What are our taxes for, if you don't use it? Revanchists, revanchists. Move to the East, if you don't like it! "Our rivers Oder and Neisse are already full of German shit" You dirty scum! Why betray or country? Don't you see that you're working for Moscow? Willy, pull it down! Pull it down! Hille, my uncle is waiting downstairs. Ouch! Shit! Damn! Fucking shit! Makes me sick! Stupid stuff! What's up? Maybe you'll be dead soon? Why? - Maybe I'm a murderer? Don't be silly! Maybe I have two Y-chromosomes. Scared, he? - No, Hille. And now? - No. And now? - No. Now? And now? Down with it! Finally down, the shameful banner. Roswitha! Wake up! Gentlemen, please. This is not what our town is like. Come with me. These things should not be emphasized. As the mayor, I can assure you... Come with me, I'll show you the view from the steeple. Der Silesian countrymen – I beg you, dear friends – I'm happy about the animated discussion, but please, don't get provoked ... by a few misdirected... You're an idiot, but you don't have to act like one! You loser. - Cheap tramp. Every Mark spent on you is too much. Elisabeth. - Come Leonhard. Come with the uncle, you innocent girls. Dimuth! That is a beautiful egg! You have a beautiful wife. - You are not so bad yourself. First something nice to eat then we'll send our cook home. She needs some rest. What's on the menu? Bananas for desert, in any case. If God is for us, who is against us? As Paul the apostle said. It's working again! Oh Lord, you have shown once again who believes in you, will be by your side. And our bells, that you saved from our homeland, will now carry our elation and gratitude to you. Oh Lord, who guided our paths to all that is good. Well, that worked out in time. Mr. Baier! Attention pilot. You are entering the the contaminated zone! Put on your oxygen mask! Put on your oxygen mask!
