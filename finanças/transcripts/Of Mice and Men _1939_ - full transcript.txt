- George... - What do you want? - Where are we going? - Forgot that already, did you? I forgot, I tried not to forget, honest I did. Ok, Ok, I'll tell you again, I got nothin else to do. Might as well spend my time... telling you things, you forget them and I'll tell you again. I tried and I tried, but it didn't do no good. - I remember about the rabbits George. - Oh yeah, you can remember a thing, rabbits. Don't you remember us going into Johnson and Beaties in Frisco... and they give us the bus tickets and the work cards? Oh sure, I remember that now. - George... - What? I ain't got mine, I must've lost it. You never had none, I got them both here, you think I'd let you carry your own work card? I thought I put it right here in my side pocket. I think we're getting to there, I'm going to ask the driver. How far to No. 3 ranch bud? Didn't I take you guys to Weed just a short time ago? Don't strain your memory, just answer my question. Ok, Ok, don't get sore. It's just a little stretch down the road, you'll do better if you get off here. Come on Lennie. Ranch No. 3, 10, 10 miles? Soledad Land Company. 10 miles. It's just a little stretch up the road, he says. 10 miles and the hottest day we've had. If I ever see that bus driver again, I'll bust his nos.. Lennie. Hey Lennie... Hey Lennie, don't drink so much water, you going to be sick. Lennie, do you hear me? You going to be sick. Lennie... That's good George, you drink some too, you take a good big drink. And I ain't sure its good water, looks kind of scummy- Tastes alright. It don't seem to be wrong in the water. You never ought to drink water, when it ain't running Lennie. You'd drink out of a gutter, if you were thirsty. - What you take out of your pocket? - I ain't got a thing in my pocket George. I know it, you got it in your hand, what you got in your hand? Oh, I ain't got nothing in my hand George, honest. - Come on, give it here. - It, it's only a bird. A bird? - A live bird? - No. Just a dead bird, I didn't kill it though, I found it, I found it dead. Alright, give it here. - Ah, let me have it George. - Give it here. What do you want with a dead bird? Last week it was a mouse. I was just petting him with my thumb while we walked along. You petting no bird while you walking with me. Oh, why ain't we going the ranch to get some supper? - They got supper at the ranch. - No reason at all, I just like it here. Lennie, tomorrow we'll be going to work. Busting our backs lifting up them barley bags. For tonight- I'm just going to lay here and look up. And I ain't caring a grain bag or a boss in the world. - Oh, Ain't we going to have no supper? - Sure we are. If you get us some dead willow sticks... me, I got three cans of beans here in my bimbo. You get that fire ready and I'll give you a match when you get the sticks together. - We'll heat up these beans and have supper. - Oh, I like beans with ketchup. We ain't got no ketchup, now go on, get them sticks. Don't you fool around none neither, going to be dark soon. I guess they're about done. You got enough beans there for 4 men. - I like them with ketchup. - I told you we ain't got none. Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want. If I was alone, I could live so easy. At the end of the month I could take my $50 and go into town and get whatever I want. Gallon of whiskey, sit in a poolroom, play cards or shoot pool and what do I got? I got you. You just keep me shoving, all over the country, all the time. And that ain't the worst, you do bad things. You get in trouble all the time and I have to get you out. Like what you've done up in Weed. They had lynched you if they had caught you. Just wanted to touch that girl's dress, because it looked so nice and soft. Just wanted to pet it, like it was a bird or a rabbit. And what you hold on for, when she started yelling her head off? - Why shan't let her go? - Oh, I, I wasn't going to hurt her. I wish I could put you in a cage with about a million rabbits and leave you there. And let them pet you. You, you want I should go away and leave you alone? Where could you go? I, I could go right up in them hills and someplace find a cave. Alright, how you eat? You ain't got sense enough to find nothing to eat. Oh, I'd find things. I don't need no nice food with ketchup on it. I could lay out in the sun, where nobody hurt me. I've been mean, ain't I? - Ain't I? - Well, if you don't want me... You only just got to say so. Oh, I could go right up in them hills and live by myself. And I won't get no birds stole from me. Somebody shoot you for a coyote, if you was by yourself. Better stay with me. - George... - What? Tell me, like you done before. - Tell you what? - About the Rabbits. Now you ain't putting nothing over on me. No George please. Tell me like you done before. You get a kick out of that, don't you? Alright, I'll tell you, go ahead and eat your beans. - Go on George. - Well... Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They come to the ranch, they work up a stake. They go into town, they blowing that stake, And then the first thing you know, they're pounding their tail in another ranch. They got nothing to look ahead to. Well, that's right but not us. Now tell how is with us. Well, with us it ain't like that, we got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a hoot about us. We don't have to set in no bar room blowing away our... jack because we got no place else to go. If them other guys get in jail, they can rot for all anybody care. But but not us and why? Because, because... I got you to look after me and you got me to look after you and that's why. Go on George. Won't you do it yourself, you know all by heart. Oh please, I forget some of the stuff. Go on George, tell how it's going to be. Someday we're going to get the jack together. And we're going to get a little house. A couple of acres... - a cow, chickens, pigs... - And rabbits. Go on George, tell about the rabbits and cages, the rain in the winter and the stove. And the cream full enough you can't hardly cut it with a knife. Tell about that George. I don't know why you don't do it yourself, you know it all- Oh please, it ain't the same if I tell it, go on George. Tell about the rabbits and how I get to attend them. Well, we're going to have a... a big vegetable patch. - And some chickens and a rabbit hutch. - And we can live on the fat of the land. And live on the fat of the land. And in the winter, when it rains, we going to say, skip the work. We going to light a big fire in the stove, We going to sit around and listen to the rain coming down on the roof. I ain't got time for no more, let's hit the hay. Look Lennie, what you going to say tomorrow when the boss asks you questions? Eh? I, I ain't going to say a word. Good boy, say, that's fine. Look Lennie, I want for you to look around here. - You think that you can remember this place? - Sure George, I can remember here. - Didn't I remember about not saying a word? - Yes, of course you did. Now look Lennie... Lennie... If you just happen to get in trouble, like you always done before- I want for you to come back here... and hide in the brush. - Hide in the brush. - Hide in the brush until I come for you. Now, can you remember that? Sure George, I can remember. Hide in the brush till you come. Until I come but... You ain't going to get in no trouble, because if you do... - I ain't going to let you tend them rabbits. - I ain't going to get in no trouble George. - I ain't going to say a word. - You got it, at least I hope so. Alright, let's hit the hay. Oh, it's going to be nice sleeping here- - Looking. - With the leaves. Boy, you sure feel free when you ain't got a job. And if you ain't hungry. Let's have different color rabbits George. Sure we will. Red and blue and pink ones Lennie. Millions of them. Furry ones, like I seen at the fair in Sacramento. Furry ones... Of course, I can just as well go up in them hills and... - find a cave if you don't want me. - Shut up. - George? - What? I, I'm shutting up George. Come in. - Some new guys have come boss. - Bring them in. - Got your work slips? - Yeah. Well, I see isn't Johnson and Beattie's fault. Says right here on your work slips, you should've been here last night. Ready to go to work this morning. Bus driver gave us a bum steer, we had to walk 10 miles. I had to send the barley wagon outside without two buckers. What's your name? My name is George Milton. George Milton. Milton. Yours. His name is Lennie Small. Lennie Small. Let me see, it is Friday the 20th. About 1:35, half an hour yet before you have to work and make it at 2. - Where you boys been working? - Around Weed. - You too? - Yeah. Him too. He ain't much of a talker, is he? No, he's a good worker though, strong as a bull. I'm strong as a bull. - What can you do? - He can do anything. - Listen Small, what can you do? - Anything you like. A good skinner, he can wrestle grain bags, drive a cultivator, anything you like. - Just give him a try. - Then why not let him answer? What are you trying to pull over? I don't say he's bright, he ain't but I say he's a good worker. He can put up a 400 pound bale. Say... - What are you selling? - What? What stake you got in this guy? You taking his pay away from him? Of course I ain't. I've never seen one guy go to so much trouble for another guy, I'd just like to know what your percentage is. He is my cousin. I told his old lady I'd take care of him. He got kicked in the head by a horse when he was kid, he's just ain't bright. But he'll do anything you tell him. Alright. I guess it don't take much brains to buck barley bags. But don't try to put anything over Milton. I've got my eye on you. Why did you quit in Weed? - Ah, job was done. - What kind a job? Digging a cesspool. Alright. But don't try to put anything over. I've seen wise guys before. Show these guys to the bunkhouse, then take them out to Slim. Yes sir. - Candy... - Yes sir. Do not forget to tell them what a nice guy the boss is. I wasn't going to say nothing boss. Hi Crooks... - What you got there? - Ross' busted saddle. - Them two guys is the new stiffs. - I know. Did the boss raise enough Cain with me when they didn't show up? He sure did. The boss always takes it out on Crooks when he gets mad. Got that crooked back when a horse kicked him. - He reads a lot, got books in his room. - Yeah? Alright, what kind of a guy is the boss? Come on, come on, what's he like? Well, he's a pretty nice fella for a boss. He gets mad sometimes but he's pretty nice. - Oh, you know what he done at Christmas? - What? Brought a gallon of whiskey right in the bunkhouse and says that... Drink hardly boys, Christmas comes but once a year. - A whole gallon, eh? - Oh, by golly, we'd fun. What were you saying? - They let Crooks come in that night... - Yeah? Well sir, a little skinner, named Smittie, takes after the black boy. The guys wouldn't let him use his feet, so Crooks got him. The guy says, on account of the black man got a crooked back. - Smittie can't use his feet. - I see. After that, the guys went into town and they tore her to pieces. I didn't go in there, I ain't got the steam no more. Pretty old dog, eh? Had him ever since he was a pup, he was a good sheep dog when he was young. Over here. - You can have them two beds there. - Alright, thanks. Alright, I'll take the top one, I don't want you falling down on me. What's this? What's this? - I don't know. - No? Says, positively kills fleas, lice and other scourges. - What kind of bed you give us? - No no, I'll tell you what. Last guy had that bunk was a blacksmith, as clean a fella as you'd want to meet. He used, used, used to wash his hands even after he ate. Then how come he got pillow pigeons? Well, he's the kind of fella put that stuff around even if there wasn't no bugs. Now, he peeled his boiled potatoes, he picked out every little speck before he'd ate it. If there was a red blotch on an egg, he scraped off and then he finally quit. I'll bet he did. No, about the food. That's kind of guy quite he was, clean. If I find a single pillow pigeon in this bed, you going to hear from me. Ok, now you two fellas get set and I'll come back in a minute to take you to Slim. Seen my old man Candy? Just left him back at your house a little while ago. I'll try to catch him. You the new guys my old man was looking for? - Yeah, we just come. - Let the big guy talk. - But if he don't want to talk? - He's got to talk when he's spoke to. - What are you shoving into this for? - Him and me travel together. And you won't let the big guy talk, is that it? He'll talk if he wants to tell you anything. We just come in. Well, next time answer when you're spoke to. Oh, what are you picking on him for? He ain't done nothing to you. Are you drawing cards this hand? I might. Well, I'll see you get a chance to ante. What's he got on his shoulder? Lennie didn't say nothing to him. Well, I'll tell you what, Curley is like a lot of little guys, he hates big guys. It's kind a like he's mad at them because he ain't a big guy. You've seen lots of little guys, ain't you? Always scrapping. Curley sounds like a skunk to me, I hate mean little guys. It seems to me like Curley is worst. Got married a couple months ago, his wife lives over in the boss' house. Seems to me like Curley is worse since he got married- Like he's sitting on an ant hill. Maybe he's showing off for his wife. Yeah, you just wait till you see Curley's wife. One, two. One, two. The two new buckers showed up Curley. I've seen them Dad, don't like their looks much. Well, I'm not going to hold that against them. We wouldn't have a man on the place if I waited for you to like somebody's looks. And if I didn't watch them like a hawk every minute, we wouldn't have a place. - Seen Mae? - Oh, let her alone for a minute. Why do you keep pestering her? She ain't do no harm. How do I know that? You know, maybe if Mae had some women to talk to... It ain't women I'm worried about. Ah, stick to your job and forget your wife for an hour. - You sure trust me, don't you Curley? - Far as I can spit. - Who's in there with you? - There ain't nobody in there. You punch drunk pug, I ain't even seen the boy, he must've just come in. Get out of here, next time, they'll carry you out. This will happen to any guy I catch with you. What did I ever do to give you the right to treat me like... Nothing but I ain't taking no chances. You got a home, you got a husband. - You got no business messing around. - Sure I got a home. You think all I want to do is sit in that 2 by 4 just waiting for you? I want to see somebody. Just see them and talk to them. I tell you, I just want to talk to somebody. - You got me to talk to you. - Yes. I lead with my left twice see, then I bring the old right cross. One, two. One, two and down. One, two, I can hear it even in my sleep. - Where did you get that pup? - Was given to me. - Slim gave him to you, didn't he? - What if he did? No guy is giving my wife presents. - You're giving that pup back. - Oh, yeah? If you're not giving it back, Slim is going to take it back. No, he wont, he's not afraid of you. We'll see whether he is or not. Wait till he takes the old one-two. One, two. One, two. Hey Slim, come on down here. Looks like we're going to have fun. I know you're the best skinner my old man is got on the place. And I know he won't let me can you... but he can't stop me from tangling with you if you don't lay off my wife. - What is it this time Mr. Jackson? - You gave her one of your pups. And? I don't want no ranch hand giving my wife presents. And? She won't give it up, so you've got to take it back. Curley ain't never going to tangle with Slim, not with Slim, he ain't. After work Slim, I'll give it to you on your own time. Hey Slim... I'm riding over to the barn, I'm going to make sure you got no more pups to give away. - Holy Smoke, that guy tried to kill us. - He was aiming at Lennie. It's like I told you, he hates big guys. Well, come on you fellas. This here is Slim fellas, what Slim says goes around here. - Ah, lay off Candy. - Candy is right. Boss tells you what to do but if... you want to know how to do it, you got to ask the mule skinner. My name is George Milton, he's my partner here, Lennie Small. - You fellas travel around together? - Yeah, we kind of look out for each other. There ain't many fellas traveling around together. - Go on George, ask him. - What's eating him? He heard Curley talk about your pups, he now he wants one of them. - Pup brown and a white one. - Ok big boy. When we get back to the barn, I'll give you one. Brown and white one. You guys ever buck any barley? I'll say, I'm nothing to scream about but this big guy... Watch this mister. You all right? - Ready Lennie? - Let her go. Hey Slim, Slim, get this. - Get out from under that wheel. - He won't drop it till I tell him. Unless the supper bell rings. There you are. Alright Lennie, let her down. Easy now, easy boy. Ok. You sure was right about him. I've never seen such a strong guy. - Give us the word Slim, we'll show you. - Hey Slim. Ok boys, let them buck. There is Curley's wife now. Don't you know what I think? I think Curley's married hisself a pack of trouble. There's plenty done that. You look her over mister and see if I ain't right. You're the new fellas that just come, ain't you? - Yeah. - Yeah. What Candy says about her is right, Curley has got a pack of trouble. - Gosh, she's pretty. - Now, you listen to me. - Don't you even look at her. - Ah, I never done nothing George. No you never but when she was standing here, you wasn't looking the other way neither. I never meant no harm George, honest I never. She was so pretty and she had a pup. You keep away from her. Yes. Let Curley take the rap, he let himself in for her. I don't like this place, this ain't no nice place, I don't like this place. Listen, I don't like it no better than you, but we got to keep until we get a stake. Come on George, let's go, let's get out of here, it's mean here. Shut up and get up and get to work, here comes that skunk again. You've seen a girl around here? Get back to work. - Couple of minutes ago, maybe. - What was she doing? - I didn't ask her. - Which way she go? I don't know, I didn't want to go. You know Lennie? I'm scared I'm going to tangle with that palooka myself. I hate the sight of him. - You ain't mad George? - I ain't mad at you, I'm mad at this Curley. You keep away from him. - Sure I will, I won't say a word. - Don't let them pull you in. But if he takes a sock at you, let him have it. - Let him have what George? - Never mind. Look, if you get into any kind of trouble, you remember what I told you? That if I get in any trouble... - you ain't going to let me tend the rabbits. - That ain't what I mean... You remember where we slept last night? - Down by the river? - Oh sure, I remember that. I go there and hide in the brush till you come. That's it, you hide until I come for you, now say that over. Hide in the brush by the river. Down in the brush by the river. If you get into trouble. - If I get into trouble. - That's it. Hide in the brush by the river. Down in the brush by the river. Hide in the brush by the river. I'll take them Slim- I've just given the pups some milk Slim. - She's feeling fine. - Thanks Candy. Curley ain't been messing around with the pups, has he? I ain't seen him Slim. - How you Slim, how it go today? - Pretty good, got two good men now. - That so? - Glad to know you, my name is Carlson. My name is George Milton. This here is my partner, Lennie Small. He ain't very small. No, he ain't small at all. Here you are Lennie, a brown and white one. - How many pups you got left Slim? - Well, I gave this one to Curley's wife. - Got two left. - You going to keep them both? I don't know, got to keep them a while to drink up Lula's milk. You know Slim? That old dog of Candy's, he's so old he can hardly walk. Every time Candy brings him in the bunkhouse, I can smell him for two or three days. Why don't you get Candy to shoot the old dog and give him one of them pups to raise up? Come on, let's wash up, there be nothing left to eat in a few minutes. - Kind of put you on the spot, eh? - Yeah. Lennie, put that pup back a while, come and wash up. I'm coming George. - Very nice of you to give Lennie that pup. - Ah, that was nothing. You don't have to thank me for that. Well, it wasn't much to you maybe but it's a lot to him. I don't know how we going to get him to sleep in the bunkhouse... tonight, he'll want to stay right out here in the barn. Going to have trouble keeping him from getting right in that box with them pups. - What we do? Catch a shower? - You can catch a shower any time. The only dish out that grub once. Lennie. You sure were right about him, I've never seen such a worker. I thought he was going to kill you bucking that barley. You just tell Lennie what to do and he'll do it, if it don't take no figuring. Funny, you and him stringing along together. - What's so funny about it? - I don't know. Just seems kind of funny, cuckoo like him and a smart guy like you. He ain't no cuckoo, he's dumb but he ain't crazy. And I ain't so smart neither or I wouldn't be bucking barley for my 50 and fun. If I was bright, if I was even a bit smarter... I'd be having a place of my own, be bringing in my own crops. Instead of doing all the work and not getting what comes up out of the ground. Yeah, I'd kind of like to do that. I sometimes would like to cuss out a string of mules if was my own mules. Sure. It ain't so funny about me and Lennie traveling together. We growed up together, at first I made fun of Lennie. I used to play jokes on him because he was too dumb to take care of himself. He was too dumb to even know a joke is being played on him. Yes, I had fun. You know, it made me seem smart alongside of him. Yeah, I seen it that way. I'll tell you what made me stop playing jokes. There was a bunch of us standing along side the Sacramento River. I was feeling kind of show-off see, so I turn to Lennie and I says... - jump in. - What happened? He jumps. He couldn't swim a stroke, so he nearly drowned. And he was so nice to me, because I pulled him out. See, he clean forgot I told him to jump in. I never done anything like that since. Now it makes me feel kind of sick talking about it. Lennie... - I'll go wash up pretty soon George. - You go now. I'll tell Slim getting out of letting have that pup. Oh, I'm going... Just like a kid, ain't he? Yeah and there's no more harm in him than a kid neither. Except he's so strong. Oh, he ain't got enough sense to take care of himself. That's alright, nice fella. A guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella. You know, Lennie is a nuisance most of the time, But you get used to going around with the guy and you can't get rid of him. You want to get rid of him? He gets in trouble all the time, like he done in Weed. You wouldn't tell anybody, would you? - What did he do in Weed? - You wouldn't tell anybody, would you? - No, of course you wouldn't. - What did he do in Weed? Well... there was this girl come along in a red dress... Here he comes, I'll tell you later. - I done just like you told me George. - Alright, that's fine. Now and eat your supper. It's brown and white, just like I wanted. Ain't you going to take me to the movies, like you promised? I seen it the other night with some of the boys. - Hello Slim. - Hello George. - Don't neither of you play any horseshoes? - I don't like to play every night. You guys got a slug of whiskey? I got a cramp. - I ain't. - If I had I'd drink it myself. I ain't got no cramp neither. Cabbage does it to me, know it was going before ever ate it. You ought have seen that stable buck Bitshune. He never give nobody a chance to win. My, that dog smells. Candy, get him out of here. I don't know nothing smells as bad as old dog smell. I've been around him so much I... - I've never noticed how he smells. - Well, I can't stand him in here. That smell hangs around even after he's gone. Look at him Candy, the old fella is all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, why don't you shoot him? I tell you what Mr. Carlson... I had him so long, I herded sheep with him. You wouldn't think to look at him now, He was the best darn sheep dog I ever seen. I knowed a guy in Weed with an Airdale that could herd sheep. Learned from the other dogs. This old fella just suffers hisself all the time- Now, if you was to take him out and shoot him... right in the back of the head, right there. Why, he'd never know what hit him. - So you won't shoot him. - No, I couldn't do that. - I had him too long. - But he don't have no fun no more- Besides he smells bad. I tell you what I'll do. I'll shoot him for you, then it won't be on you to done it. Oh, let him alone Carl. It ain't a guys dog that matters, it's the way a guy feels about his dog. Me, I wouldn't trade my mutt here for one of them field trial pointers. Candy ain't being nice to him, leaving him alive. Listen, Slim's hound get their litter now- I bet you he'd give you one of them pups to raise up. Wouldn't you Slim? Yeah, you can have a pup. Carl is right Candy. That poor dog ain't no good to himself. I wish someone shoot me if I get old and a cripple. Maybe it'd hurt him, I don't mind taking care of him. He'd be better off dead, the way I'd shoot him, he wouldn't feel nothin. Say, have you guys seen this? Right here, read that. I don't want to read nothing. It'll be over in a minute Candy, come on. - Did you see it Slim? - What is it? Read that, read it out loud. - Dear Editor? - Yeah. I've been reading your mag for the past 6 months. I think its the best on the market, I like stories by Peter Rand. I think he is a wingding. - What you want me to read that for? - Oh, read the name at the bottom. Yours for success William Tanner. What you want me to read that for? You don't remember Bill Tanner, worked here about three months ago? Oh, sure. Carl, you remember him, a little guy... Yeah, that's him, that's the guy. Candy, if you want me to, I'll put the old fella out of his misery right now. There's nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't hardly walk. You ain't got no gun. Yes I have, I have a Luger right here in my bag. The way I'll shoot him, he won't feel nothing. Maybe tomorrow, let's wait till tomorrow. I don't see no sense in waiting. You know, I ain't got no hankering for this, I'm a doing it for you. What do you say Candy? Candy, you better let him go. Alright, you can take him. One of my lead mules got a bad hoof, got to get some tar on it. I bet Lennie is out there in the barn with his pup. Yeah, bet he won't never come back in here, now that he's got a pup. Anybody like to play a little Rummy? I'll lay out a few with you. OH, what's taking him so long? Lay out some cards, why don't you? We get no Rummy played this way. I'm working. Hey Slim, I think I'd better get that other brush. Hey Lennie, you got to quit petting that pup for the night, ain't good for him. Put him back with his mother and run over the bunkhouse. I'll do whatever you say that's good for the pup, you bet. I'm going right now. Thanks for sending the big guy out, I got to talk to you. - You got nothing to say to me. - Please Slim... I got to talk to somebody or I'll go crazy please hear me. I ain't meant to live like this. I'd leave this place only I've got no money, my mother won't take me back. I only married Curley because I want to get away from her. Maybe I ought not say this but I don't like Curley. No, you oughtn't, you oughtn't be here. You ought not talk to me or any guy on the ranch. Go on back to the house where you belong. I don't want to listen to your troubles. You got no troubles except what you bring on yourself. Poor kid, I should've let her talk. - Any of you guys seen my wife? - Ain't been here. Where Slim? He went out to the barn, said he had to put some tar on a split hoof. - How long ago he go? - Oh, 5, 10 minutes, I don't know. - I think I might like to see this. - Let's all take a look. Curley must be spoiling or he wouldn't start for Slim. Curley thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he? Yeah, it looks like it, Of course Slim ain't. At least I don't think Slim is, come on. Did you see Slim out there in the barn? Yeah, he told me not to pet that pup no more tonight. - Did that girl come in there? - You mean Curley's girl? Yes, Curley's girl, did she come into the barn? Yeah, I seen her. Ok, I guess them guys ain't going to see no fight. Lennie, if there is any fighting... are you going to get out the way and stay out? I ain't going to say. Lennie... Both ends the same, why is both ends the same George? Because they just build them that way. - George... - What do you want? How long is it going to be before we get that little place and live on the fat of the land? I don't know, you got to get a big stake together first. I know a little place we can get cheap but they ain't giving it away. Tell about that place George. Now Lennie, I just told you just last night. Ah please, tell again. Alright, well... we'll have a couple of acres... and it'll be a little windmill and a little shack on it and a chicken run. It's got a kitchen orchard with cherries, apples, peaches, cots, nuts... It's got a few berries and a place for alfalfa with plenty of water to flood it... - it's a pig pen... - And rabbits. I could easy build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to them rabbits now there. They'd nibble and they'd nibble, like I've seen them do. Do you know that we wouldn't have to sleep in no bunkhouse no more? And nobody could fire us in the middle of a job. Tell about the house George. Yeah alright, we'd have a little house and a room to ourselves, And when we put that crop in, we'd be there to take that crop up. And what else? Go on George, you know more something else. Alright, now wait a minute. Yea, I know, you know what? We could've a few pigeons to fly around the windmill. Like they've done when I was a kid. And it'd be our own and no could nobody can us... and if we didn't like a guy, we can say, git and he'd have to do it. But if a friend come, we'd have an extra bunk and you know we'd say? Eh? We'd say, Hey, why don't you spend the night? And by golly, he would. And we'd have a setter dog, a couple of striped cats. You'd have to watch out them cats didn't get after the little rabbits. You just let them try. Oh, I'll break their neck, I'll smash them cats right with a stick, that's what I'll do. - You know where's a place like that? - What? - You know where's a place like that? - Suppose I do, what's that to you. Don't have to tell me where is at, might be anyplace. Yeah, that's right. Why, he couldn't find that in a 1000 years. How much they want for a place like that? I could get it for 600 bucks. The old people that own it are flat bust, the old lady needs medicine... Say, what's that to you? You got nothing to do with us. I know I ain't much good with only one hand. I lost my hand right here on the ranch, give me a job swamping. And gave me 250 dollars because I lost my hand. I got 50 more save up, that's 300 and I got 40 more coming at end of the month. Tell you what, suppose I went in with you guys. That'd be 340 dollars I'd put in... - How that be? - No, I got to think about that. We was always going to do it by ourselves, me and Lennie. I never thought about nobody else- I tell, I'd make a will and leave my share to you guys in case I kicked off. Maybe we could go there right now, you guys got any money? Sure... we got ten bucks between us. Now look, if me and Lennie work for a month... and we didn't spend nothing at all we'd have 100 bucks. That'd 4, 440... I think we could swing her on that. And maybe you and Lennie could go and get it started... and I'd get a job and make up the rest. I think we could swing her, I think we could swing her. I got hurt 4 years ago, they'll can me pretty soon. Just as soon as I can't swamp out no bunkhouses. They'll put me on the county. Maybe if I give you guys more money... you let me hoe in the garden, even after I ain't no good at it. And I could wash dishes and do chicken stuff like that. But it would be on my own place and I'd be left to work at our own place. You've seen what they done to my dog tonight... They said he's no good to hisself and nobody else. When they can me, I wish someone shoot me. They won't do nothing like that. And I won't have no place to go. I can't get no more jobs. We'll do her, Candy, we'll do her. Yes, we'll pick up that little old place and we'll go live there. And look, if there is a carnival or circus come to town... or ballgame or anything like that, we'll go to it. We wouldn't ask anybody if we could. We just say, we'll go to it and we would. And we'd milk the cow and we'd take the grain and sling it to the chickens... And we could. And put some grass to the rabbits, I wouldn't forget to do that. When are we going to do it George? In one month, right smack in one month and you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to write those old people that own the place that we'll take her. Maybe Candy would give us 100 bucks to bind her? I sure will, I sure will, I got it right here. - They got a good stove there? - Oh yes, it's a nice stove, isn't it? - It, it burns both coal and wood. - You can have the whole 300 right now. I'm going to take my pup, bet by god he'd like it there. No, no, wait a minute. Now don't tell anybody about this. Just us three and nobody else, now you got that? Because they're liable to can us and we, we won't get no stake. We just go on as if we were going to buck barley for the rest of our lives. And then one day, all of a sudden, bang. We'll grab our pay and we'll scram. - There's, there's $300 right there. - And we won't tell nobody, George. - You bet we won't. - And we won't tell nobody George. - Right Boy. - George... Yes? I shouldn't ought to let a stranger shoot my dog. I'd have shot my dog myself George. Alright, now you know. Well, I'm just asking, you don't have to get sore about it. I ain't sore about it, I don't want any more questions, that's all. Just don't want any more questions. Well, I didn't mean nothing Slim, I just asked. Well, you've been asking too much, I'm getting sick of it. If you can't look after your own wife, what you expect me to do about it? You lay off of me. Now I'm just trying to tell you I didn't mean nothing, I just thought you might've saw her. Why don't you tell her stay home where she belongs? You let her hang around the bunkhouse... first thing you know you'll have something on your hands. You stay out of this, unless you want to step outside. Why you palooka, you're as yellow as the bottom side of a frog. If you ever come at me, I'll take your head off. He tried to throw a scare into Slim too, but he couldn't make it stick, we seen it. Yeah, I seen him. What do you think you're laughing at? Get up on your feet. No big lug is going to laugh at me, I'll show you who's dumb. - Put up your hand Lennie, fight him back. - Don't make me, leave me alone. - No, don't let him do it, get him Lennie. - Fight back Lennie. - You'll kill him if you fight back. - George, make him stop. - Put your hands up Lennie. - Fight him, why don't you Lennie? - George, George... - Fight him Lennie. Get him Lennie, I said get him, don't let him do that you you Lennie, get him, get him. Let him go, Lennie, let him go. Lennie, that's enough Lennie, let him go. Let go of him Lennie, let go of his hand Lennie. Get some water Whit. You told me to George, I heard you tell me to. Got a knife? Looks to me like as if every bone in his hand is busted. Carlson, get out the buckboard, we'll have to get him to town to see a doctor. Right. - I didn't want, I didn't want to hurt him. - Alright Lennie. Wasn't your fault Lennie, he sure had it coming to him. Slim, George and Lennie going to get can now? - Going his old man going can them now? - I don't know. You got your senses enough to listen? Now you listen, I think you got your hand caught in a machine. If you don't tell nobody what happened, we won't. But if you do tell and try to get this guy canned, we'll tell everybody. Then will you get to laugh. I won't tell. Oh, Nelly. Say, this is a swell joint. Oh, what I tell you? Even get a shot here for only 15 - cents and no water in the whiskey neither. - Hi you Whit. Oh Susie. Get your coats on girls, it's the sheriff. Hey George, shake hands with Susie. She's a card, always cracking jokes. - Hi. - Hello. - Sit down. - Boys, sit down. - Take a weight of your feet. - You boys know Pops. I'll pop you. This one here is Marlene Dietrich. Ah no Susie, you know I don't look much like Dietrich. You don't look nothing like her. - And that's Hedy Lamarr. - And that's Greta Garbo. I want to be alone. See what I tell you George? Ain't she a laugh? She can keep it up all night. What's that? A posey for getting nosey... What's so funny? Why don't you take a walk? Nobody is talking about you. - Drink up pie faced pal. - Be sure you don't. What's eating him? Say, I bet he came down here special to see... that nobody talks about what happened last night. - What did happen? - No, nothing. He won't be satisfied till he slugged somebody tonight. Didn't do so good the last time. I ain't even going to get a chance of make it because I ain't staying long. Well, what's your hurry? Lennie is on the ranch, I don't like leaving him alone very long. You got no right to come in my room. I ain't wanted in the bunkhouse and you ain't wanted in my room. Oh, why ain't you wanted? Because I'm black, they play cards in there but I can't play because I'm black. Everybody is gone to town. George says I got to stay here and not get in no trouble. I've seen your light. Don't see what you'd do in the bar anyway. My pup, I just come in to see my pup. Come on in and sit a while. As long as you won't get out and let me alone... might as well come in and sit down. All the boys gone to town, eh? Everybody but old Candy, he just sits in the bunkhouse sharpening his pencils. Sharpening and figuring, sharpening and figuring. - Figuring? What's Candy figuring about? - About the rabbits. In the bunkhouse, what rabbits you talking about? About the rabbits we're going to get and I get to tend them. That's baloney, I don't blame the guy you travel around with to keep you out of sight. You think its a lie but we're going to do it. We're going to get a little place and live on the fat of the land. You can ask George. You've been traveling around that guy a long time, haven't you? Sure. Sometimes George talks to you and you don't know what he's talking about. Ain't that so? Ain't that so? Yeah, sometimes. George knows what he's about. Just tells you things, it don't matter to him if you understand or not. It's just having someone to talk to. It's just being with another guy. That's why he travels around wit you. Sure, him and me goes everyplace together. Suppose George didn't come back no more. Suppose he took a run out powder and ain't coming back. - What would you do then? - I... Suppose George went to town tonight and you never heard of him no more, just suppose so. He won't do that, George won't go leave me, he'll come back. Don't you think he will? You want me to tell what would happen? They'd take you to a booby-hatch. They'll tie you up with a collar like a dog. Then you'd be just like me, living in a kennel. - You hurt George. - I was just supposing, George ain't hurt. What you supposing for? Ain't nobody going to suppose no hurt to George. Of course they ain't. But maybe you can see now, you got George. You know he's coming back, suppose you didn't have nobody. Suppose you can't go on the bunkhouse and play Rummy because you're black. Suppose you have to sit out here and read books. Books ain't no good, a guy needs somebody to talk to him. I tell you you get too lonely, you get sick. George won't go away and leave me. Oh, I know George won't do that. Lennie, Lennie... Look Lennie, I've been figuring out something about the place. You can come on in if you want. Oh, I don't know, of course if you want me to- Oh, come on in, everybody is coming in, you might just as well. Going to be like a racetrack. Nice cozy little place you got here. Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way. Sure and a dung heap under my window, all to myself. About the place, you said about the place. I got it all figured out. We can make some real money on them rabbits, if we go about it right. Oh but I get to tend them, George says I get to tend them. You guys just kidding yourselves. You'll be a swampier here till they take you out in a box. I've seen hundreds of guys come by on the road, knowing ranches. Figures on the back and same fool thing in their head. Everyone is got a little piece of land in his head and never a one of them gets it. - Oh, we are too. - It's just like heaven. Nobody ever gets to heaven and nobody gets no land. Well, we're going to do it. George says we are, he's got the money right now. - He's got the money? - Yeah. Well, he's got most of it- There's just a little bit more to get and George is got the land picked out too. - Now, you take 12 rabbits. - I've never seen a guy really do it. I've seen guys most crazy with loneliness for land- But every time a dame or a blackjack game took it away from him. Well, they ain't going to get it this time. Let's go to Chuck's Roadhouse, I got twenty bucks left. Whatever I got, that goes for me too, Monday starts another month, yippee. Twelve rabbits. At six months... If you guys want a hand to work for nothing. Just for his keep, I'd come and lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a mischief. Well alright but we got to talk to George about that. - Now, you take 12 rabbits. - 12 rabbits... Different color rabbits. Sure, sure. Twelve rabbits and six months time... got it right here. For a second there George, I thought that little place you told me about was a goner. It's off, ain't nothing going to stop us now. ♪ There's a meeting here tonight, there's a meeting here tonight. ♪ ♪ I know you by your daily walk, there's a meeting here tonight. ♪ ♪ There's a meeting here tonight. There's a meeting here tonight. ♪ I know you by your daily walk... ♪ I told them they oughtn't be here but they come in anyhow. Couldn't go to bed like I told you, could you Lennie? No, have to get out in society and flap your big mouth. I never done nothing bad George, honest. Look George, George, I've been figuring and figuring... I've even got it doped out how we can make some money on them rabbits. - I thought you wasn't going to tell nobody. - Well, I didn't tell nobody but Crooks. What you tell him for? Look George, Crooks says that if we let him come in with us... - Get out of here, both of you. - But George, Crooks said he'll work... Maybe you better go, I ain't sure I want you in no more. Listen Crooks, ain't nothin against you. It's just that we said that we wouldn't tell nobody else. I know, them guys coming in here, sit and made me forget. I suppose you're looking for Curley, well, Curley ain't here. I know Curley ain't here, it's Saturday night, ain't it? Got his arm in a sling and he went anyhow. - I come to ask Crooks something. - Don't ask me nothing. Saturday night, everybody is out doing something. What am I doing? Standing here, talking to a bunch of bindlestiffs. You ain't wanted here, wee told you that. You ain't got sense enough in that chicken head to see we ain't stiffs. You do not know that we got our own ranch to go to. And our own house, we ain't got to stay here. We got a house, we got chickens, we got fruit trees. And we got a place 100 times better than this and we got friends. - That's what we got, we got friends. - You old goat. If you had two bits, you'd be in town getting a drink and sucking the bottom of the glass. I know you guys. Maybe she'll ask Crooks what she come to ask and then get home. What happened to Curley's hand? So it wasn't a machine, Curley didn't act like he was telling the truth. - Come on Crooks, what happened? - I wasn't there, didn't see. What happened? I won't let on to Curley. He said he caught it in a gear, who done it? Nobody done it. - So you done it. - No. - Well, he had it coming. - I didn't have no fuss with Curley. Maybe now you ain't scared of him no more, maybe you'll talk to me sometimes now. Everybody was scared of him. Say, I didn't sock Curley. If Curley had any trouble, its none of our affair, ask Curley about it. Look, I'm going to try to tell you something. I tried to tell you to get out, that didn't do no good. So I'm going to try to tell you in another way... Now you see, us guys got something that we're going to do. But if you stick around, you're going to gum up the works. It ain't your fault but... Look, if a fella steps on a round pebble, he falls down and breaks his neck... it ain't the pebble's fault... but the guy wouldn't have done it if the pebble hadn't been there. What you talking about pebbles for? If you didn't sock Curley, who did? Nobody socked Curley, he got his hand caught in a machine. Where you get them bruises on your face? He caught his hand in a machine. So it was you. Well, maybe you're dumb like they say you are. And maybe you're the only guy on the ranch with nerve. - You're a nice fella. - Listen... I've tried to give you a break... but I'm not going to let you mess up what we're going to do. Now, you let that guy alone and you get out of here. You won't tell me what to do. - I got a right to talk to anybody I want. - Milton. You couldn't hardly wait for your pup to get home from his night's... drunk so you could snitch on me, could you? But you didn't tell him what I know to tell him. Who busted your hand Curley? - I told you I caught it in a machine. - I saw that machine last night. I told you. Why didn't you tell your old man so he can him? - Double crossing... - I'll tell you why. Because you was scared if you talked, they'd talk too. You were scared to get the horse laugh. Like I'm giving you now. There's a pug with a crippled hand. I ain't even going to slug you. I'm going upstairs and pack your junk. You're getting out of here, you and me are through. One, two. The old one, two. - Toothpick? - That sure was a good breakfast George. Probably the last one we'll get in this place. George, Slim says not to worry. He's went to talk to the boss. If you'd only stayed in your place like I told you. George, did you send off the money when you was in town last night? How many times do I have to tell you? You guys drive me crazy. No, no, don't get sore George. I only asked you, George... What? Did you have fun in town? We just sat around. Susie was cracking jokes guys was just starting out to raise a little puny Cain. I never been like this in my life. You know, just pushing out a dime and a nickel to buy a drink. When I think what a lot of carrot seed you can get for 15 cents. Not to belittle you and all but bulk seed, you sure can. Seeds, seeds, I can't think of nothing else. Well, a guy is got to have some fun. I went to a dance hall in Bakersfield once. What a place, went upstairs on a red carpet. There's big pictures on the wall, sat in a big soft chair. There was cigarettes on the table and they was free. Pretty soon a chap comes in with drinks on a tray and them drinks was free. You take all you want, pretty soon a girl comes in. Said she was hostess. She was so polite and nice, quiet and pretty... it made me scared to ask her for a dance, that was a long time ago. Are you saying all this was free? Right up till I was leaving. And then how much them soft chairs set you back? 15 bucks. You had a cigarette and a drink and a look at a pretty dress and that cost you 15 bucks? You just shot a week's pay to walk on the red carpet. A week's pay? Sure. But I worked weeks all my life. I don't remember none of them weeks. But this, nearly 20 years ago, I remember that. The girl I met was named Arline. On a pink silk dress. Well, its Ok, you guys ain't going to get canned. You sure Slim? Lucky for you, the boss is got to move that grain. I bet Curley's wife catches it though. I went clear out the gate when I remembered your, your foolish little face. You coming with me. What you covering up there? Just my pup, just my little old pup. - He's dead. - He was so little. I was just playing with him and he made like he was going to bite me. And then I made like I was going to smack him... - and then he was dead. - But don't worry none. He was just a mutt, you get another one easy, the whole country is full of mutts. Yeah, it ain't that so much. George said if I done any more bad things... Wait a minute, where you going? I ain't going to have nothing to do with you. George said I ain't to talk to you nor nothing. Listen, don't worry about talking to me. You know those guys yelling out there? They got a tournament. None of them ain't going to leave till its over and it ain't going to be over till dark. I ain't supposed to, George sees me talking to you, he's going to be mad, he told me so. What's the matter with me? Ain't I got the right to talk to nobody? George says you're going to get us in a mess. What harm am I doing to you? Seems like they ain't none of them cares how I got to live. Confidentially, I'm going away from here. I got to make something out of myself yet, I ain't used to living like this. I come from Salinas, come there when I was a kid. There was a show coming through there once and I met one of the actors. Wee going to have a little place and rabbits. He said he was going to put me in a movie, says I was a natural. Soon as he got back to Hollywood, he was going to write me about it, you listening? I never got that letter, I always thought my old lady stole it. Oh, I ain't going to stay in no place where you couldn't get nowhere or... make some money yourself or they stole your letters. I asked her if she stole a few and she said no. So I went and married Curley. And went to the Riverside Dance Palace that same night. Oh, I hope George ain't going to be mad about that there pup. I don't like Curley. I'll leave him, I'm going to thumb a ride to Hollywood. We going away from here pretty soon, this ain't no nice place. I'm going to get in the movies and wear all them nice clothes. I want nice clothes like they wear. And I'll set in them big hotels and they'll take pictures of me. When they have them opens, I'll, I'll go and talk on the radio. Won't cost me nothing, I'm in the picture. I want nice clothes like they wear, this guy says I'm a natural. We going away, far away from here. Course, when my old lady hears I run away from Curley... she won't ever speak to me no more. She'll think that I ain't decent, that's what she'll think. Well, we ain't really decent, know what my old lady tries to hide. My old man was a drunk, put him away. One night when I was just a little kid, him and my old lady had a terrible fight. They was always fighting. In the middle of the night he come into my room and said, let's you and me run away. He said we got to live together... we got to live together because you're my own little girl. Why you, you bake little cakes for me and I'll paint pretty pictures all over the wall. And in the morning they caught us and put him away. I wish I would've went. They locked him up for drunk and... in a little while he died. Maybe if I took that there pup and trowed him away, George wouldn't never know. Then maybe I could tend the rabbits without no trouble. - You goofy. - No I ain't, George says I ain't. I just like to pet nice things, smooth things. Well, who don't? Everybody likes that. I could feel silk and velvet, you like the feel of velvet? You bet by golly, I had some too. A lady give it to me. Aunt Clara, she give it right to me. About this big a piece, I wish I had that velvet right now. I ain't seen it for a long time. - I must've lost it. - You goofy. But you're kind of a nice fella, just like a big baby. A person can kind of see what you mean- Sometimes, when I'm doing my hair, I just sit there and stroke it because is so soft. Some people got kind of coarse hair, you take Curley. His hair is just like wire, mine is soft and fine. Here, feel. Right here. Don't you muss it up. You're messing it up, stop and let go. Please don't please don't yell, George is going to say I've done a bad thing. Don't do that, you're going to get me in trouble just like George says you will. Lennie... Lennie... George is going to be pretty mad at him taking that pup out. Slim says I can have one of you guys. I'll ask him. Oh, Slim- It's Ok Candy, your old dog wouldn't mind. Lonesome for a guy be without a dog. - Can have a lot of fun at our little place. - Sure he could, you seen Lennie in the barn? His pup wasn't there, he must be out playing with him some place. Now don't be mad with him, George. I got to get him or he won't remember to get any supper. Candy, did that dog follow you out of the barn? Come on. What done it? George, what done it? I should've know it. I think way back in my head, maybe I did. What we going to do now George? What we going to do now? - We can't let him get away. - No, we ought to let him get away. You don't know that Curley, Curley going to want to get him lynched. - Curley get him kill. - Yes, that's right. Curley will and the other guys will. You and me get that little place, can't we George? You and me can go there and live nice, can't we George? Can't we? It's all off, I know, it's all off. He was such a nice fella I didn't think he'd do nothing like this. Lennie never done that meanness. All the times he done bad things, he never done one of them mean. I ain't going to let them hurt Lennie. Listen, listen, I'm going over the bunkhouse. Then in a minute you come out and tell the guys about her, I'll come along and make... out like I never seen here, will you do that? Sure George, I'll do that. Give me a couple of minutes and you come run out yell like you just found her. You done it, didn't you? I suppose you going to act, everybody knows you'd messed things up. You wasn't no good and you ain't no good now. I could have hoed the garden, washed the dishes for them guys. Could've had pigs and chickens and in the winter, the little fat stove. And the wind and the rain coming and us just sitting there. Hey, hey, hey you guys. - Someone is murdered Curley's wife. - What? I know who done it, that big guy done it, I know he done it. Why, everyone else was out there playing horseshoes. - Hey, my Luger is gone, it ain't in my bag. - Maybe you lost it. No, no, I seen it there this morning, it's been took. Then he's armed. Listen Mr. Jackson... the poor guy didn't know what he was doing, tell them not to shoot him. Not shoot him? He got Carlson's gun, eh? Sure I'm going to shoot him. - I'm going to get him myself. - Here they are Mr. Jackson. - I suppose we couldn't let him get away? - Not a chance. Couldn't we bring him in and then lock him up safe? If we could only keep Curley here. But you heard him, he's still mad about his hand. Supposing they catch him... they'll bring him back, strap him down and then lock him up in a cage. - That's ain't no good George. - I know it, I know it. You got any idea where he might've went? I think there's only one way to get Lennie out of this. You want I should go away? I'll be close by. Lennie? You see George? I come right back here, just like you told me. You see, you wasn't going to go away and leave me, was you George? I heard them guys walking through the woods, What was them guys doing in the woods George? - Hunting. - Why we go with them? I like hunting. Is it because I've done a bad thing? That don't make no difference. Is that why we can't go hunting with them guys? That don't make no difference. George, ain't you going to ball me out? - Will you have it? - Sure, like you always done. Like if I didn't have you, I could take my 50 bucks, Lennie, you can't never remember nothing that happens... but you remember every word I say, don't you. Ain't you going to say it? Go on George, say it. If I was alone, I could live so easy... could get me a job, never have no mess. And when the end of the month comes... and when the end of the month comes, I'd take my 50 bucks... Go on George, tell how it's going to be. Lennie, I want for you to sit down there. And I want for you to look across that river... because I'm going tell you like you could almost see it. Go on George. - We're going to have a little place... - Oh, wee got to to have a little place- We're going to have cows, pigs and chickens. And down on the flat, we're going to have a field of alfalfa. - For the rabbits. - For the rabbits. - And I get to tend the rabbits? - Tend the rabbits. And we can live off the fat of the land. Just keep looking across the river, like you can really see it. Where? - Right there, can't you almost see it? - Where George? Keep looking, just keep looking... Oh, I'm looking George, I'm looking. It's going to be nice, ain't I right? There ain't going to be no trouble... no fights, there ain't going to be nobody mean... Yeah, I can see it, right over there. George, I can see it.
