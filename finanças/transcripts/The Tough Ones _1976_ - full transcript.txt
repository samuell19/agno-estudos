Hello? Hello? Listen without interrupting. Tell captain tanzi that the dog will bark tonight at 7pm, at the same place. I repeat, the dog will bark at 7pm, at the same place. Hello? Hello? Good evening, captain. I haven't seen you in a while. I was about to call you. Captain, you want to ruin me. If someone finds out about us meeting, do you know what would happen to me? I know what will happen to you if you stop collaborating: An expulsion order and a report for violating it. I'm at your service. I didn't say anything. Let's just say it didn't happen. Alright. Go ahead. The guys from marseilles are opening a new gambling joint tonight. Ferrender will also be there. Where? 16 Marco vilneo street parioli district. Please, captain, I'm not involved. Don't compromise me. Thank you. Hello? This is tanzi. Tell polliana to bring two cars to parioli, 16 Marco vilneo street. I repeat, 16 Marco vilneo street. A hundred thousand a hand. A card... Your card, your card, your card... Get lost! Stay put! Identity papers please. Police! Get up, quick. Clear off! Help! No! Quiet! Everybody against the wall. Remain calm, make it easy for us. - Show me your identity papers. You too. - Listen... Stand up and give me your identity papers! - Give me your identity papers. - I left them at home. You? This was useless. Bring a couple of them in.. Alright. Come on, quickly. Go. So, how did it go? They got us one more time. Calm down, Leonardo. We'll get ferrender sooner or later. I wish I was half as confident as you are, caputo. While we're here wasting our time this guy is screwing up the whole city. But I assure you that if I catch him... What's going on? Stop, don't move. Ferrender's one-armed henchman is here. It'll take me two hours. Come pick me up around midnight. Savelli! Who are you? Do I know you? You're carrying a weapon, aren't you? Go on, move! I want my lawyer. I didn't do anything. Ferrender Emmanuel Dominique, born in Marseille, August 6, 1931. Seen in Italy for the first time in 1972 in Milan, during the robbery of a jewelry store in monte napoleone street. He's been in Rome since the spring of 1974, he's been indicted for 6 robberies in as many banks. After a brief war with the local underworld, he manages to take control of drug trafficking, illegal joints and prostitution. He was mastermind behind two kidnappings: "Industrialist boggio's and property developer longhi's." That's enough, colantoni. So, "dead hand", where's your friend, ferrender? I'd like to point out that my client doesn't have to answer any questions without a judge present, and he'll be taking legal action against you, tanzi, for personal injury. You're doing nothing, 'moustache'. Your client was carrying a gun. Yes, a 7.65, that he has permit for, and he didn't use it. - It's true. - Shut up! Or you'll end up in the hospital. Leave him alone, don't be stupid. They're trying to get you into trouble. Excuse me, captain tanzi... - Mr ruini is asking for you. - Tell him I'm busy. Leonardo, listen... We've been friends for six years, since you joined the mobile brigade. Listen to me. Listen to someone who's been a cop for 20 years: Calm down. This is how they screw us, hiding behind the penal code. Yes, I know. Unfortunately it is like that. Listen, captain. Given that there are no charges against my client, I'd like to know if he's under any restrictive measure or if he's free to go. Yes, he's free. So, we can go then? Good bye. Carry on, captain. Come on, I'll buy you some coffee. This is 198. Believe me, it's another false lead. First the gambling joint, then the bachelor pad. We've been to a hundred places and came up empty-handed. It's wasted gasoline. You're probably right but we have to try, right? Alright... I'll check this last building. - Help! I'm being robbed! Help! - Mommy! Get up, motherfucker! - Let go of me! - Scumbag! What are you doing? Relax. Juvenile court. - How old are you? - 15, miss. - And you? - 16. - What's your name? - Nicola. What does your father do, Nicola? My dad's in jail. What did he do? He killed my mother. Who do you live with now? With some friends. Is he your friend? Yes. How do you support yourself? I steal. Snatching handbags, wallets, stuff like that. And you? I drive the scooter. He's really good, miss. He used to work as a mechanic in a shop, but he only earned 800 lire a day. So, you know... Favorable opinion. Released on bail. Don't move, this is a robbery! What's happening? Get over there! Help! Get on the ground! On the ground! I said get against the wall! Move! Come on, hurry! Hurry up, quick! Fast or we'll get caught! We got it! Let's go! One of the robbers had an artificial left hand. It's clear that it was savelli. Yes, I know what you're thinking. If we had listened to you... Please! We have another dead body but we respected the law. That's what's important. Listen to me, Leonardo. No, you listen to me. We can't keep going like this. It's not only a matter of emotions but of principles. Those guys aren't afraid of anything anymore. They laugh at our powerlessness, - at our scruples. - Yes, maybe it's like that, but what can we do? Let's create a special brigade. A brigade empowered by the magistrature to fight crime with more freedom of action. Tanzi, as a citizen, I can agree, but as a vice-prefect and as your superior, I must say no. We've made an effort to improve our system these past few years to be on par with other European countries. These are just words, Mr. ruini. Reality is different. France and Germany have passed special laws. Even the Swiss don't beat around the bush when interrogating smugglers. In the meantime, we allow savelli to steal and murder because of legal bureaucracy. Tanzi, the law sets precise limits. Yes, only for us. We can't stoop to the same level as the criminals. He's right. Just imagine the reaction of the press. The press, the press! I want ferrender, and to catch him... Go see what's going on. Enough, I said! Let me go! Let me go! What's going on? What's all this racket? This man refuses to sign the statement. He says he'll only do it in the presence of his lawyer. What did he do? He ran over an old man with his car in a pedestrian crossing. What are you waiting for? Lock him up! Who gives a shit. My father's lawyers will get me out by the end of the day. You see, Anna, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's cynicism. Especially in young people. You don't want to understand them. What do you know about their problems? To you, young people are just good or bad, period. Don't be silly. Leo, I'm not being silly, it's the truth. The truth is that criminals have to be prosecuted. You're always looking for extenuating circumstances for them: Society, family, lack of affection and other sociological drivel. Of course, I should be more like you. Don't you realize you're becoming a kamikaze for state violence. Oh, I'm sorry! Next robbery, instead of going after ferrender, I'll call his lawyer to ask him for his sociological profile. Ok? Hello? Yes, this is he. What? Ok, I'm coming. I'm sorry dear, but I have to go. See you at the restaurant, ok? - Did you call the forensics team? - They're coming. - Leonardo! - How did it happen? They had just robbed an old pensioner, then, the truck came out of the corner and... How is this possible? I arrested them 2 days ago. Who let them go? It was the juvenile judge, under pressure from the psychologist. - Anna? - Yes, I think so. We're so stupid. We kill ourselves to catch them and a stupid, naive chick feels sorry and lets them go. - You're talking about Anna. - No. I'm talking about two young kids dead by excess of humanity. Those two boys would've been better off at the reformatory than dead. Are you convinced now? You don't want to understand. I helped others and I assure you that I was able to change their lives. Not all of them, of course, but I think prison makes them all criminals. I keep arresting them every couple months, your favorites! Please, lower your voice. This is what your compassion does, it encourages more criminality! Leonardo, you're exaggerating. Forget it, francesco. Thank you, but it's useless. Come on, Anna, he only meant that... No... let her go. She'll calm down. There it is, moretto's car. Are you sure? As sure as the fact I'll never have a car like that on my salary. Be careful, the pigs are here. Of course they have to come and break my balls when I'm working. Good morning. He said good morning. Polite people always answer. When polite people meet a surgeon about to perform an operation, they ask him: "Are we disturbing you professor moretto?" And being the polite person I am, I answer: "Not at all. What can I do for you?" Don't be a smart ass. Get down! I said get down, hurry up. Understood? What's up, tell me. Why are you giving information to savelli? - Who? - Savelli. Who the hell is savelli? Be careful, moretto, your hump doesn't bring you good luck anymore. Neither do rabbit's feet, as a matter of fact. Good one, huh? Go ahead, laugh. It just so happens that savelli is married to your sister. Leave my sister alone, she can fuck whoever she wants, got it? You hurt me! You're taking advantage because I'm handicapped. Go fuck yourself. Quit it with the drama. Drama, my ass! Got it. You tell me my hump doesn't bring me luck and you break my balls. Leave those alone at least. Come, let's have a look at your car. Shall we go? Go where? I've got work to do here! - Hurry up. - I've got to work! Move it. I'm not playing around here! - You're wasting my time. - Give me the keys. Here. What do we have here, huh? If this is not baking soda, you're screwed, moretto. This stuff ain't mine. - It's not mine! Someone planted it. - Come with us in the meantime. We'll have a little talk. I can't talk right now... Vincenzo! Where are you taking him? - Sandra, stop it! - Cowards! Cowards! Sandra, call the lawyer, these guys want to castrate me. Sons of bitches! Don't worry! Don't worry! I'll handle it! Don't worry, Vincenzo! Let's go back to the old methods. Do you mind? Answer! Answer! What am I supposed to say? That I like it? That I don't? I don't know! - What do I have to say? - You must say: "I don't dislike it, sir." I don't dislike it, sir. See? You can be polite when you want to. Listen, moretto, I'd talk if I were you. Under the new laws, I can keep you in police custody for 48 hours. Think about it. 48 hours, just you and me. Yes, and my lawyer as well. I want my lawyer, dammit! We'll tell your lawyer you banged against a door. Tell me, where are savelli and ferrender? I don't know shit! I know nothing! Have mercy! Leave me alone! Where are savelli and ferrender? - I don't know! - Talk! I don't know! I know nothing about it! Have mercy, for Christ's sake, have mercy. I'm just a cripple! I beg you. I beg you. I have... I have to piss. Fine, go with him. But bring him back as soon as he's done. I must piss. Hurry up. Screw you! Screw you! I'm gonna piss in my pants... I'm gonna piss in my pants... Here. Here you go! Here, you miserable bastards. You worthless bastards. Fucking pigs... Filthy pigs! I'm gonna destroy this son of a bitch. I'm going to get rid of you. I swear I'll get rid of you. Come on, moretto... Come on, come on, let's do it! Help, I'm dying! I killed myself! Help me! Motherfuckers! Antonio, get an ambulance, quick! Understood. Yes, thank you, keep me informed. Nothing serious, luckily. He'll be out in two days. Good. What measures should we take? None. We'll take no measures against Vincenzo moretto. What about the drugs? Come on, tanzi, even a newbie lawyer could prove that you were the one who planted the drugs. Got it. So I'm the one who's under investigation. No, for the time being I'll just transfer you from the crime squad to the office of business licenses. This way we'll avoid the investigation. And just like that, once again, justice won, right? Maybe not, but we'll avoid a scandal. Imagine the newspaper headlines tomorrow: "Police officer hits defenseless hunchback." There she is. What do you want? Let go of me! - No! Help! - Let's go! Let me go! Should we wait or should I serve the antipasto? No, I'll wait. Thanks. Listen, can I make a phone call? Of course. Are you sure that the miss went out? Yes, more than a half hour ago. Thank you. No! What did I do to you! Shut the fuck up, bitch! No! Let go of me! - Leave me alone! - Would you shut the fuck up? Come on, hurry up! Quickly! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! What will you do to me? You'll see. - But why? - That's enough. What did I do to you? You're scared, aren't you? Go ahead! No! No! No! No! Stop! That's enough for now. Want to bet the bitch wet her pants? Here you go, gorgeous, this is for that bastard boyfriend of yours. Shall we go? We'll be there soon. Don't even think about it. She's in a state of shock. No injuries. Yes, they kidnapped her to give me a lesson. And I think I know who's behind all this. She suffered a violent trauma. We'll keep her under observation for 48 hours then we'll send her back home. How do you feel? Did you see their faces? No. They had... they had masks on. Where did they take you? I don't know. I don't remember. It was a Meadow. Don't make her too tired. She isn't in a condition to talk for a long time. I'll come back as soon as I can. Bye. Leonardo... Please, no retaliation. It was just a work-related accident. Captain. She was holding this bullet tightly. We didn't notice it earlier. Maybe it can be of use to you. Maybe. What did you say your name was? Angela antonini. I have a tobacco shop on dei gracchi street. One moment. I've been waiting for a decision since march. I'm sorry Mr. gerace, but there's no file about your billiard room. That's impossible. Keep looking. I told you, there's no file. I don't want to teach you how to do your job, but prefect farnese assured me my file was processed. The prefect can assure anything he wants, but your file isn't here, got it? Excuse me, why don't you take a tranquilizing pill, commissioner? You need one. - Here you go, madam. Thanks. - Thank you. How long have you been working here? - 22 years, sir. - Are you crazy? I've been here 2 days and I've already had enough. - Somebody's got to do it. - Yes. But I joined the force to fight crime, not to do paperwork all day. Excuse me. Hello? Licences office. You called the wrong place. You have to call the immigration office. You're welcome. Shooting in tormarancia unknown people shoot machine guns from a white BMW if someone asks for me, I went to the barber, ok? Yes, sir. What do you want? - Savelli. - You're wasting your time. Do you understand? I haven't seen that son of a bitch. He left me here alone with the kid. You're his wife, I can talk to you, right? I've got nothing to say. I've never been a whore nor a rat. Sandra! Who's breaking balls over there? Well, well... look who it is. Paying a little visit to your sister? Why, is it forbidden? No, not at all. Did you send me this? No, you're wrong. Must've been someone else. Swallow it. - Excuse me? - Swallow it! You're kidding, right? I said, swallow it! Ok, I'll swallow it. Where do you get off? Watch... You happy? Sorry, captain. Cheers! Let's go, it's late. I've got a busy day at the coffee shop tomorrow. I have to work with the soccer betting pool cards, you know? A little longer, Paola, it's only 9pm. - Franco! - Who are you? What do you want? Get out motherfucker! Get out or we'll kill you! Help! No! Let go of me! Let go of me! Franco! Franco! Son of a bitch! No, Franco! Let go of me! Franco! - Stop moving! - He needs to be taught a lesson! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Guys, put him in the trunk. Yes, take the keys. Come on, Stefano, quick! Inside. - Inside, inside! - Yes, go on! Franco! Leave him alone! Franco! And now, we're gonna fuck your girlfriend, you fucking proletarian! Cowards! Come on, guys, on the grass! - Let me out! - Let go of me! Come on, let's get busy! Come on, beautiful! Come on darling, don't be a bitch! Come here. - Take your clothes off. - No! - Wow, not bad! - No! Come on, beautiful, don't be ashamed. We won't hurt you. On the contrary, you'll have fun. No! No! No! Please! Leave me alone. No! Hello, is it you? Meet me at tormarancia. Yes, at the square. There's a coffee shop. Hurry up, please. What do you know about savelli. I don't know him. I only know pierino pradi. He has a big pair of balls. Unlike the pigs in here. Guys, let's give her a big stick. Yes, go ahead! Of course. Go ahead! You like it, don't you? I went by savelli's. Guess who was there? The hunchback, I suppose. There's surely something happening and moretto is in charge. Exactly. If we want to find ferrender and savelli, we have to keep an eye on him. I got it, I'll spend the night here. Good. Call me at home if there's anything new. Captain, weren't you working in the business licenses office? As you said, I was working there. Take my spot. Bye. Stop! Stop. We've been attacked, they raped my girlfriend. Help me, please. Get in. - Where is she? - Over there, by the grass. Paola! - Paola. Paola. - Franco... Franco, take me away from here, please. Don't cry. It's ok. Calm down, I'm here. - I want to die. - Fucking cowards! Try to calm down. - I don't want to go to my place. - No, no, no. Calm down, it's all over now. We have to take her to the hospital, quick. - Wait, let me help you. - Thank you. - Can you stand? - Yes. Come. Let's go. Come, get in. It's over now. Would you be able to identify them? One of them was wearing a white sweater and had the face of a spoiled child. Come on, let me play. Gaetano, you're about to see a champion at play. Don't break my balls. Let me play. Is this yours? It's your sister's. What's going on? Hey you, stop! No! No! I'll make you forget about women forever. Got it? You stupid daddy's boy! I want to see you try to do it again! And you too, you're of the same kind! Bastards! Coward! Coward! Speed up, we're losing him. Speed up, he's on our ass! Tanzi here. Lungotevere, acqua acetosa. Intercept a blue dino Ferrari, license plate b-707-12. Hurry up. We're screwed! Run him over. Go! Run him over! What are you waiting for! Stefano... Stefano, answer me! Stefano! No! Stefano! Stefano! - Get out. - No, leave me alone. Stefano! Stefano! I've had enough, do you understand? I've had enough of this shit. He was supposed to stay at the licence office and leave his gun in the bottom of a drawer. The fact remains, Dr. ruini, that they tried to run him over. It was a matter of self defense. That's not the point. You would have acted differently! And I would've probably gotten killed. Where's tanzi now? He's at the prosecutor's office, making his report. I'm gonna tell you a secret. This boy's father was my schoolmate. He's a good person. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. I understand. Do you need anything else, Dr. ruini? Yes. You're in charge of ferrender's case until further notice. Whereas tanzi, it'd be better if he stays out of my sight for a while, understood? Very well. Hello? Hello, mom, it's me. Marta! Hello, marta! Hello? Marta! Were you calling mommy? No, Tony, I swear. Why do you keep lying to me? You know you're not supposed to call your mommy. You know it, right, bitch? I won't do it again. I won't do it again. Come here. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Go away! You disgust me! - Stay still! - Don't touch me, you're disgusting. I hate you, leave me alone. I hate you... no! No! There you go. You'll feel better soon. You're better now. - You like it, right? - No. Stupid bitch. We'll check the files. Excuse me, where's the licenses office? Last door on the left. - May I? - Come in, madam. - Excuse me, I'm Maria assante. - Can I help you? The widow of sergeant assante. Yes, I remember. How are you, madam? Have a seat. Mrs. assante. Good morning, captain. I was looking for you. You know, my Antonio liked you very much. He even talked about you the day before... He got killed. That's why I came to see you. Do you need anything, madam? Yes. I can't take it anymore. I'm desperate. It's about my daughter. Marta went down the wrong path. In the beginning I tried to warn her, to help her, but it was useless. It's been weeks since she left home. She left with a low life. A guy named Tony. They say he's a drug dealer. Did you file a report? Yes, but they told me that she's 19 years old, that she's an adult. And she can go wherever with whoever she wants. I see. - Tony, you say? - Yes, Tony. Were can I find him? I don't know. I remember marta telling me she met him in a night club. "The Morocco," I believe. Damn. Do you need help? Yes, thank you. I can't start it. Let me take a look. It must be the carburetor. - You think? - Look. Help! Help! - Stop! Stop, you coward! - Fuck off! Stop! Help! Stop! Stop, you coward! So long, bitch! Help! Bastard! Leonardo... It's unbelievable, where there's trouble, there's you. Did they transfer you from the licenses office to the anti-theft squad? Take him in. Or do you like playing vigilante? Come, we've been waiting for you for half an hour. Here, madam. Captain tanzi, judge bennato. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Here's the body. Been buried for a long time. Before coming up with a hypothesis I'd like your opinion. What do you think about this? It won't be easy to identify it. Unless the finger prints are already on file. But the mutilated left hand reminds me of something. A ritual from the marseilles men. That's what I wanted to hear you say. Would you mind explaining what it means? It's a signature, judge. Almost certainly ferrender's work. Probably settling a score. If you say so... I'll have the body taken away. Go ahead. Keep me informed. It could be important. - Of course. - By the way, do you know a night club called "Morocco"? No. Why? Nothing. I'll probably go dancing. Do you know him? I never saw him before. And that filth Tony, when was the last time you saw him? Tony who? Don't think I haven't recognized you. You still have a year left, don't you, carmine? - Only 8 months, captain. - Tony! 73 coronari street. He has an attic. I didn't say anything. Please, captain. It's good that you're asking nicely. Hello? Hello? Is it you? Look, tanzi is looking for you. Tanzi? Who's tanzi? Oh, thanks. Marta! Marta! Come on stupid, wake up! - Get up! - What's happening? Wake up! I'm taking you to your mommy. Get up, piece of shit! - Get up! - Please, I'm sick. I want to sleep. Hurry up, if you don't want me to beat you up. Hurry up! Get dressed! Hurry up! - You're still there? Stupid bitch! - Tony, I'm really sick, I can't make it. - Too bad for you. Let's go! - I can't make it! Mommy... You know what? You're starting to piss me off. Send an ambulance to 73 coronari street. Hurry. Stop! Don't move or I'll slit her throat! I said don't move! Don't move. Where are you going? Get out of the way! You don't want to be a smartass. I'm tanzi. - Sarti, narcotics. - Where's the girl? The ambulance just took her. She was in bad shape. She probably had an overdose. Given to her by some bastard, to kill her. But managed to escape. But I'll find him, even if I have to search the whole city. Marta, my baby! Marta... why? Let's go. I didn't feel like working anymore after what happened, so I took 6 months off. What are you gonna do now? I'll go to Milan, to my cousin's. Don't you think maybe being apart for a while will be good for us? Maybe. We have to work on our relationship, Leonardo. When are you leaving? Saturday morning. Fine. I'll take you home. Poor girl. Yes, poor girl. Beautiful, aren't they? They're beautiful, no doubt about it. But I can't give you more than 2 million lire. What are you talking about? This is rich people stuff. Sorry, moretto, but I can't give you more than 2 million. Come on, moustache, don't be like that. Half a million more. Come on. I have to make a payment on the Porsche in 2 days. Times are hard, moretto, people are afraid to invest, and this stuff is hard to sell. Moustache, let's make an 'historical compromise'. [, the hunchbacked proletarian, will only steal for you. You, the smart capitalist, will only do business with me. But, to do this, you have to give me half a million more, understand? No, I can't. Times are hard as I told you. Come on, moustache, don't be like that. I'll even let you touch my hump. Go ahead, touch it, it will bring you luck. I thank you, but I don't believe in those things. You're wrong. You're really wrong. Now you're dead. Caputo. _ yes. I arranged everything. The commissioner gave us carte blanche. - Did you start the operation? - At this time, Rome is completely covered. I want a report every 15 minutes. I'll take care of the rest. Another thing, always keep a free frequency for the patrol cars. - Got it? - Got it. How careless of me! Do you know what day it is today, caputo? No. Today is my 25th wedding anniversary. Go, leave, come on, what are you waiting for? - Puntato! - Yes, sir? Is there a florist shop nearby? A florist? But it's almost midnight. I need a dozen red roses. Right now! - What do we do with him? - Take him to colantuoni's. Ok. I want my lawyer. - Hey, you seem pissed off. - Very pissed off, sorry. - What's going on? - What, you don't know? No. We don't know anything at the licenses office. They kidnapped mancuso two hours ago. Who, the famous jeweler from via veneto? Yes, that one. He had millions in jewels with him. Excuse me, see you tomorrow. Let's go, boys. If you knew how much it bugs me to see the others in action while I rot in mountains of paper. And maybe they'd like to rot, right? Yes... By the way, has the castelfusano body been identified? No. I think the file will be closed. I see. Ferrender gets away one more time. - Leo. - Yes? I'll be right there I'll give the keys to the doorman. Ok. Fine, tomorrow I'll arrange everything... Excuse me, do you have a lighter? Move! Go on, get in! Leonardo! Excuse me, I have to make an important phone call. With Mr. caputo, please. It's urgent. No funny business! Get out! It's not my fault. I told you, she injected herself. Scumbag. You're the one who killed her! Who's giving you heroin? Talk! - I don't know them. They're south Americans. - What are their names? I don't know. Give me the names! - I don't know the names. - Of course you know. I don't know them. What are you doing? No... what are you doing? Are you nuts? You're cra zy! No... No, no! You can't do that! No. You showed her no mercy. No... wait. If you spare me, I'll give you some precious information. About ferrender. What? Don't you know that ferrender... Leonardo, what happened? Hello. Caputo here. Get me the flying squad. There's been a homicide at the olympic village. Inform prosecutor bennato. Over and out. Well done, you tore him to shreds. But why didn't you kill that asshole cop? Why? Because he'll have to look me in the eyes when I kill him. He'll have to look at me and shake with fear. The motherfucker will shit his pants. Got it? Speaking of a motherfucker... This morning, I went to the can. I felt something weird... I told myself: "Damn, what's happening?" I push, I shit, I get up, and look what I found in the crapper. How is it possible? How is it possible? Because I'm miraculous. Do you know that Saint Clair who was spitting daisies? Because she was protected by god. But, since I'm protected by Satan, I shit lead, understand. It's with this bullet that I'm gonna sort this fucking cop out. Fuck him! You'll see. So, tanzi, you weren't on duty and you were just there by chance. I see. And you, caputo? Me... I arrived just before they shot from the overpass. I saw the drug dealer fall to the ground and, at the same time, the citroen taking off at full speed. Are you sure the shot was fired from the citroen? Or are you associating the 2 facts because they happened at the same time? Stop playing around with words, be clear. That's what I'm looking for: Clarity. No, you're insinuating that parenzo was killed in a different way. If you want to pin this murder on me, go ahead. But don't beat around the bush! Keep your voice down. I won't keep anything down! It's not my career that's at stake, but my reputation! Listen, Leonardo, I think... No, caputo, let me talk! Enough! To be clear, I'm not the one putting your reputation in doubt, your methods are! You care too much about the code, about politics and the press. Maybe you forgot that you got where you are by use of your fists. Here's my badge. You'll get my resignation later. As you wish. 3 gangsters attacked the people's bank at piazza Zara. They're locked inside with 10 hostages. - Caputo, let's not waste time. Hurry. - Right away. I'll inform the commissioner. Get her up! They're really wrong if they think we're kidding. We have to leave here with the money otherwise it'll be a massacre! I'll kill you all like dogs! How's the situation outside? Calm. Way too calm. Shoot anyone who tries to get close or tries anything! When will they make a decision? Caputo, how is it? I sent the anti-terrorism squad to the roof. - Anything else? - No, nothing. They gave a new ultimatum. A judge as hostage and a car. Or they'll kill a hostage every 20 minutes, starting at noon. We don't have much time. You two, get a little closer. Listen, did you already make the report? Yes. Answer. Hello? It's that pain in the ass prosecutor, he's asking us to free the women. I won't free anyone! I want a judge and a car. A judge and a car. - Good, thanks. - You're welcome. That's enough. How did it happen? It was the guard who locked them up, but the getaway driver fled in a white BMW. And now? And now prosecutor bennato is trying to negotiate, but, knowing ferrender's gang, talking is totally useless. Either we budge or it'll be a massacre. Shouldn't we try at least? Yes, and ruini skins us alive. Right now they're going to skin the hostages alive. I know. Marchi, give me a cigarette. - So? - It's a mess. Let's hope for the best. I know almost all of the bank employees. Were you a banker? If only! My son installed the air conditioning three years ago. I helped him a few times with part of my salary. - You said air conditioning? - Yes. Let me go! I want to leave! - Calm down. - Let me go! Make her shut up. She's pissing me off, tell her to stop! Tell her, you fucking accountant! I want to go out! No! No! Calm down. - Do you know who I am? - Yes, of course. - Are you a good shooter? - Good enough, captain. Come with me. - Hurry up. - I'm almost done. Done. 500 lire, sir. - Your name? - Galeazzo labire. "Galeazzo la pira, I'll pay with my dick because I haven't one lira." What a fucking scumbag... Didn't you hear the news? That must be the gangsters' car! Hello, 1137? I just saw a white BMW. Don't do anything stupid. Calm down. I repeat, nothing happened. I just fired a couple shots in the air. But if you don't agree to our conditions in 10 minutes, I won't answer for the hostages safety anymore, understood? Go on. Get over there! You! Face the wall! Do you understand? Move, hurry up! If in 2 minutes the phone doesn't ring you're dead! Dead! Understood? We're here. I'll kill her! If the car isn't here in a minute, I'll shoot her! I'll kill you all! Carlo, take me away from here! Calm down. It's over now. - Let's go outside, please. - I don't feel well. Calm down, madam. It's all over. It's all over. Don't worry. Alright, fine. Listen, tanzi... I won't take back what I said. I'm convinced that policeman must always respect the law. "Car 21, attention to all cars." We've intercepted the robber's BMW at the start of marconi boulevard. - "I repeat..." - What are you waiting for? You're still the chief of the special forces squad, aren't you? If you'll allow me, Dr. ruini you're a son of a... Leave it at that, tanzi. Now, go. Go! What do you want? - Get out. - Are you crazy? Get out! Turn around. Go! Hurry up! Someone is dying in there. I don't give a shit. Keep going straight if you don't want to die too. Don't worry, hang on. What's going on? What's going on? Why are we turning around? What do you want? I want to know where we're going. I can only tell you where you're going. To the cemetery, motherfucker. Go. Go, go, go! "Car 15, the robber with the BMW has stolen an ambulance, license plate 46912. He's in portuense district." - I repeat... - Let's go. - What's your name? - Oronzo. Oronzo, don't be a "stronzo", if they catch us, they'll fuck us. Good one, isn't it? Go. Speed up. "Car 15. We're trying to intercept the ambulance" with the robber in the eur laurentina district. "I repeat, eur laurentina district." "Car 15, we hear you loud and clear. Let's meet in the mentioned area." Tanzi here. Don't lose him. And try to push him towards the ring junction. Over. Pass him! To the left. Be careful! They're both dead. He had... he was a hunchback, the fucking son of a bitch. A little longer and he would've killed me too, captain. You see? I was right. Send two teams, one to the slaughterhouse and one to his sister's. - You can go. - Thank you. Let's go. Hello? A call from Milan? Yes, I'll take it. Hello? It's you... Sorry? The two killed in the bank? Yes, that's them. I'm sure of it. The third one was called albino. I know I should've told you before but try to understand. I just wanted to keep you out of trouble. It's in the past, let's not think about it anymore. Do you remember where they took you? In a scrap yard outside the city. Listen Leo, I don't think I'll come back to Rome. At least for the time being. I think it'll be better for both of us. As you wish. Anna! - Do you know Vincenzo moretto? - No, I don't know him. Do you know them? No, I've never seen them before. - Nothing, captain. - Ok, let's go. - I've never seen them. - Thank you. Have a good day. - Are you the foreman? - Yes, why? - Who is the owner? - It's two brothers. Luciano and Giovanni ciotti. They've had it for 2 years. Before, it was someone else's. Are they renting? The land belongs to someone else. Yes, it belongs to a guy named geraci... Gerace... something like that. I see. Let's go. You'll see, it'll be our fault if moretto starts killing people around Rome. What the hell does the press want? This time they're right, caputo. Why? Yes, maybe. They're probably right. The poor couple in the ambulance died leaving two young children behind. I swear that if I find moretto... Mr. tanzi! I found that file in the end. I don't give a shit about your files! But, you asked me to get it. Don't you remember? Gerace, the guy from the billiard room. Ferdinando gerace. - Hunchback! - Hey! Hunchback! I'm here! Everything good? Fine. Mancuso's brother gave me half a billion lire. Half a billion... I'm kidding, stupid. - When does the boss arrive? - In one hour. Ferdinando gerace, 42 years old, no criminal record. He bought the place only 6 months ago. - What do you think? - I don't know, Leo. We've hit so many brick walls. This time we nailed it. Can you see the citroen? It's the one used by the killers of the drug dealer. What are we waiting for? If my intuition is right, ferrender is already here or he'll come soon. What do you want to do? I don't know. While we were driving here, I was thinking that if I met them face to face, ferrender and moretto, I would kill them. Now, I'm not so sure. This time I have no doubts. "Car 20. A few minutes ago, mancuso, the jeweler, was set free in the settebagni neighborhood." "To the cars on duty on the ring junction: Make roadblocks." Hey! "I repeat: To the cars on duty on the ring junction." Maybe that's him. 10% to cover the expenses. 15% for you. Albino will take the rest to Switzerland. Do we have an agreement? Meh... Is something wrong? That's right. Something is very wrong. What? The cut. Life is getting more expensive, you know? The meat, shoes, gas... And a very important thing went up as well. - What? - Artillery. So what? So, it's not enough. Fine, you'll get 20%. Is it ok? It's better. - Hands up! - Don't move. Give me the suitcase. Look! Fresh, straight from the bank. I bet this is mancuso's ransom. It's starting to be clear now. I bet we'll find the rest inside. Here, take this. Come on, let's go. I'll go this way. Don't move. Sorry if I'm interrupting you, buddy. Let's go back to the old methods, do you mind? Let's go back to the old methods! Don't be like that. Do you recognize it? I shat it just for you. You can kill me, but you and ferrender are screwed, the place is surrounded. Are you listening, albino? He's still talking about ferrender. Stupid fuck. I killed ferrender 3 months ago, asshole! Who do you think was the body you found in castelfusano? Huh? Who do you think it was? Drop your gun! Drop it! Turn around. There won't be any suicide attempts this time, because I'll kill you like a dirty dog! No, caputo! You can't! Caputo! No! Freeze!
