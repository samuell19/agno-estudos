You always know what you want. If the idiots at the agency knew we finished three hours early... Imagine the hard time they'd give us! I've never worked with bigger jerks! They think they rule the world just because they're in advertising! Seriously. "A wine glass a day sure is the way"... Can you imagine a dumber slogan? If it wasn't for the paycheck, I'd tell them to go to hell. And their demands! Posing nude for twelve hours straight! Know what I'll tell them someday? That they should have their pretty wives pose naked, that'd be a real show! Like meletti's wife. Picture that. She's so fat you could never squeeze her into frame! Don't tell them we finished early, seriously. They'll want to pay us half! See you tomorrow, bye! See you! Good morning. I need a box of culebras, thank you. I'm sorry, we don't carry those. Take this brand, they're even better. I'm sure you're right, but he's very particular about his cigars. - Can I return them if he doesn't like the brand? - Of course, miss. - How much is it? - 5000 lire. - Here. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - See you. - Good morning! - Good morning, miss francoise. - Can I pay you tomorrow? - Of course, any time. Back already? Done. This thing between us has run its course. Why? Why? Hey... Goodbye, love. You've reached emanuelle's answering machine. I'm not home right now. You have one minute to leave a message. Starting now. You've reached emanuelle's answering machine. I'm not home right now. Yes, it's her. We found this letter among your sister's belongings. It's for you. It was from the address on the envelope that we were able to track you down. Read it, please. I'm afraid we had to read it as well. We hope it sheds light on why this poor girl took her own life. "Dear emanuelle..." I read your article in Sunday's paper about the missteps taken by... Certain progressive feminist movements. You're right when you say that a woman shouldn't lose her womanhood. Be brave and fight your battle, I'll always be by your side. I'm in good health. My thing with Carlo hasn't been that good, though. He likes me and I feel protected... But you know how he is. He always needs money. You'll look amazing dressed as a Mexican revolutionary. This is the film that will make you famous. I can't wait to see you on set, acting like a star. No way, sweetie. I don't want you on set. I'd feel like an amateur with you watching me. Besides, who knows if they're gonna pick me. Being an actor is a tough job. You need connections and more. You also need to be good, and you're the best, Carlo. Sure, tell that to the producer. He casts his actors from photographs. Good! We can ask Franco to make a giant picture of you! We'll send it to the producer, what do you say? Right, and he can stick it in the garden of his villa to scare crows! Stop busting my balls and tell that idiot director that the money's mine, got it? - Hi what's-your-name! With you in a sec! - Hit! Tell that asshole he can go back to his cooperative and make shitty art flicks. I guess getting a real meal every day has gone to his head. He'll be back eating scraps in no time if he keeps acting like this. Let's pretend this meeting never happened and no changes to the set! Get lost! - I know you're good workers, don't worry. - Thank you, sir. - Hey, wait for me! - Boy, was he pissed! - Maybe he had a rough night! - It took me forever to do these sketches! - Hey. - Good morning. - Hello. - This the girl you were telling me about? Let's go, follow me. Not even the Americans have a set like this one! Sergio Leone shot a scene for his second film here. The title escapes me. What I'm trying to say is that my films have a real budget. You can earn a lot of dough in this field, right, Carlo? Take your time paying me back that money, by the way. Now, doll, I'm gonna show you something interesting. Do you remember the ending of "god forgives, Ringo doesn't!"? I got a lot of satisfaction out of that flick! Yes, sirree! Anyway, this here was the sheriff's office. - I forgot the cigarettes in the car. - Sure. - I'll be right back. - Carlo? Follow me, francoise. You're not scared, are you? What's taking Carlo so long? He's a good boy, that Carlo. Not very lucky with cards, though. Yes, sirree. Well, this was the saloon. Oh, francoise! We want to find that man at all costs, and you can help us. I'm sure this wasn't the first letter your sister sent you. Some people don't deserve to exist. Unfortunately, our investigation hasn't turned anything up. It seems that your poor sister was leading a double life. Not one of her friends or coworkers ever met that man. Please, carry on reading, I didn't mean to interrupt you. You know how much I love Carlo. I can't live without him. Things aren't always bad. He loves me, too. Perhaps in his own way, but he loves me. Carlo is like a little boy who needs to be protected and supported. I've acted like a worm. Yes, a worm. You're right, you know. But I'd never thought it'd come to that. That rotten bastard! I owe him money. You should leave me. I don't deserve you. I love you so much, but... But I'm not the right man for you. You see, francoise, these things are disgusting. But it doesn't matter, the only thing that really matters is love. True love. Love that comes from within. I can't go on without you. But you should leave me. I'll never leave you. I need you in my life. Thank you. Come on, come on! Don't hold him back! Let tigellino run a little! Easy, easy. You can relax. - You have to be in shape. - Go now. Don't overwork the horse, Lorenzo. I want him in top shape for Sunday. And stick to the diet that the vet gave him. Yes, madam. - What's with those three? - The shorter guys are bookies. A couple of small-timers, but the tall guy is a big time gambler. Word is he's up to his neck in debt. Probably a pimp or worse, a scumbag dealing in illegal trafficking. Long story short, not somebody you want to get involved with. Did you hear what I said? Quite the contrary, Lorenzo. I heard you loud and clear. That tigellino is a nag, don't you see it? That's just your opinion and I've got mine. Get out of here, Carlo. Imagine the betting odds for that nag. - No way. - A horse with a one in a thousand chance. How fucking incompetent can you possibly be? Here's some free advice, Carlo: Bet on dog racing. - You have a better chance with those. - Yeah. - I'm serious. - That's the horse you need to win big. There's only one guy I know who'd bet on that horse. - I leave him in your hands, Lorenzo. So long. - Don't worry. Bye. I always wondered whether you prefer horses or women, Carlo. - See you later, guys. - See ya. - He's really something, this guy. Standing straight and proud, with her narrow flanks and abundant breasts... The noble horsewoman rides through the pasture and its herds. It was quite amusing. Well, I hope you liked it. It wasn't that bad. Original, right? Have you ever heard better verses? I believe a poet created them quite some time ago. Does it count? - Maybe. - Well, I stole them, then. But seriously, I'd love to get to know you. I'm Carlo, what's your name? Does it matter? You're tiring the horse, just one more lap and get him back to the stable. Can't you see he's drenched in sweat? Hey, horsewoman! You still haven't told me your name! I often wish I didn't exist. That I'd never been born. Love and hate aren't opposite feelings, not really. I hate Carlo as much as I love him. I'm completely under his thumb. Under his... 50000 lire. Deal. 50000 more. I see your 150000. Pair of aces. Wait. Three 9's. They're yours. Alright. So long, guys. It's been a pleasure playing with you. See you soon. Goodbye. How did it go? Did you win? Well, I held my own. Cut it out. Oh, come on, Carlo. Oh, Carlo... Carlo! Who are they? What do they want? No! Let me go, Carlo! No, I don't want to! I don't want to! - Let me go! - Keep still! No! Carlo, no! Carlo, no! Let me go! Carlo, please! Please, no! No! No! Please, no! - Well played! - Really? - A couple more lessons and you'll see! I'm parched, I'm going to get something to drink. I'll take a shower, see you later. - A pernod, please. - Right away, madam.

And the serpent said to Eve... "Taste the forbidden fruit and you'll know the delights of lust." The forbidden fruit is supposed to be eaten slowly. - Is it a written rule? - Yes. A man like you doesn't happen along very often. I want to remember this experience for my whole life. And I guarantee you'll remember it, too. You're so unpredictable, that's what I like about you. I am, Carlo. Be quiet, now. Wait here. I was so happy that night. Carlo hadn't been that kind to me in months. He was gentle with me, in his own special way. I was so happy I was afraid to speak, afraid to break the spell. Carlo took me out to dinner. What is it, Carlo? Nothing. Did I do something wrong? Or maybe you're not feeling good? I feel great and you did nothing wrong. Waiter. - Yes, sir? - Another bottle, please. - Yes. You're trying to get me drunk? Like that night you came back from Paris. Do you remember it? Yeah. Of course I do. I love you so much, Carlo. I've been thinking about us for a while, you know. I was almost convinced you didn't love me anymore. I was feeling desperate. But I'm feeling so happy today. So happy I'd like to shout it to the whole world. - Did you hear what I said, dear? - Yes, of course. Here's the wine. I'm feeling so much in love tonight. I'd do anything you'd ask me to do. - You really mean it, francoise? - What? Anything I'd ask you to do. Of course. Why do you even ask? Nothing, just an idea. What is it? What's wrong? I can't hide anything from you. I'm in big trouble. I've lost a lot of money recently. I tried to win it back, but you know how luck goes. I haven't had the luck, and now I owe... 3 million lire. To the guy from marseilles. I owe another million to valeri, that prick. He's a loan shark. What happened to that land management business of yours? Why don't you tell them about it? Maybe they'd give you more time. They don't give a shit about that. They want their money, and they want it now. - Or... - Or what? You'll have to bid me goodbye. Wait, we could sell the car. The furniture. I have some gold jewelry. We'll find the money, you'll see. That won't work, don't be an idiot. We'll never manage to, even if we sell everything we own. But... There's one way. What?

How else am I supposed to dry them? Come on, be a good boy. Stop acting like a baby. No! No! I'm too embarrassed! There's nothing to be embarrassed about, and I don't bite. But, you see, I... All done. Stay here, I'll be back in a moment. Take it easy. You're a good looking man. And I like good looking men. You have the body of an ancient Greek warrior.

It's a personal question. If you don't mind, obviously. I'm usually the one who interviews people, but go ahead. It won't take long. I wanted to talk about Carlo. I'm afraid I don't know who you're talking about. How can you not remember it? It was at the hippopotamus club. You looked like two old friends. That tall guy. That was just a brief encounter. Nothing else. He's vanished into thin air. We were living together and now his creditors are hassling me. He had debts with everyone. I wouldn't worry if I were you. Carlo is a fickle individual with shifty moods and a passion for chasing women. But don't worry, I'm sure he'll come back if he really loves you. - You think so? - Sure I do! Sooner or later, men always come back. Anyway, I notice you've already found a handsome replacement. No, that's just a loser who's trying to get me into the sack. I'm afraid that the men in this country only want one thing. Even your Carlo tried to get me into bed. Sometimes I feel like men disgust me. Sure, they only want us for one thing. Anyway... I'm Mira. I'm emanuelle. I think we could be good friends, Mira. I think I could help you, I do portraits as a hobby. And I'm in desperate need of a model. Why don't you swing by my house tomorrow? I can pay you well. - Tomorrow at your place? - Yes. Sure. - You see those two? - Yeah. - What are you doing tonight? - I'm really busy. Hello, Mira. - Am I late? - You're right on time. Come in. - I brought my friend Pamela. - Good, you can both pose for me. She has a perfect body, she'll be the ideal subject for your paintings. Mira... I've always wanted to pose. Great, you can pose together. Two beautiful woman, right out of a poem by sappho. - Have you heard anything from Carlo? - Nothing at all. I don't miss him like I used to. I've got a new circle of friends now. You were right, men are disgusting. Have you ever made love with a woman? - Is it very different? - A totally different experience. Making love with a man is brutal, one-sided. The woman is passive. Making love with another woman is sweet, passionate, and complete. Both sides are free to please themselves and each other. It sounds marvelous. - You're an incredible woman, emanuelle. - All women are. Sappho the poetess, little lesbia, the great Elizabeth I... They were women who loved only their own kind. They hated men and the oppression they represented. - You must be loaded, living in a house like this. - Less loaded than you think. Me and my friends beg to differ, considering what you're buying. Cut the bullshit, it doesn't scare me. Come on, you know I'm your friend. - I can do without friends like you. - But you can't do without my stuff. Wait a second. Let's drink a toast. Cheers! - Hello, sweetheart. - Get out of here. Why? Did I do something wrong? Get out of here. Out! Emanuelle! - How was it? - It was fantastic! Here, let me give you a hand. It's incredible! You go so fast it's like you're flying! I'm so happy! And Rodolfo is such a marvelous man. You should marry him, you know? He's such a marvelous man. You should marry him, you know? He's such a marvelous man. You should marry him, you know? I love you so much, emanuelle. I love you so much. - Why? - Because it'll make you feel better. It'll make you dream, you'll see. - What are you doing? - Soon you'll be free. Free to return to your sordid businesses. But there's one thing you'll never do again. You'll never hurt another woman again. Does the name francoise mean anything to you? She was just a young girl. A naive young girl without a care in the world. Except for loving... Except for loving a rotten thing like you. You destroyed her love. You made her a slave. A slave unable to resist your depraved will. Francoise was so fragile. You gave her no choice. All that was left for her was killing herself. Look at me, Carlo. Do you know who I am? I'm her sister. The only person she loved who loved her back. You killed her. But I'll make sure you can't kill another girl like francoise. You know the world is full of girls like her. Don't worry, I'm not going to kill you. I won't do that. That would be letting you off too easy. Death would be a liberation. Instead I'll make you something less than a man. You'll crawl back to the world like a worm. You'll be broken and humiliated. You'll always remember the pleasures you've seen here... But you won't even have the satisfaction of jerking off. Broken and humiliated, Carlo. Just like poor francoise. Feel free to press charges against me when you're free. It will be a cold consolation for you, worm. I've got no more reason to live in a horrible world with horrible people. People like you. What's going on? Help! - Find the main switch. - Yes, sir. Hello? Get me the homicide squad. Is that you, cerruti? Listen, there's been a murder. Yes. Quite a messy scene. A woman axed to death. No clues. The culprit must have fled right after the killing. Establish roadblocks around the area. Yes, call the morgue to send an ambulance to collect the body. I'm at cimarosa street, number 32. Hurry up, come on. Bye. Death wasn't immediate, she must have suffered. I think this is the work of a sexual predator. Everything here points to it. This wasn't just a robbery, that's for sure. The victim's only relative was a sister who killed herself months ago. There's nothing we can do other than an autopsy. - All right. I want a full lab report within 24 hours. - Yes, sir. Come in, you two. How quickly can we get an autopsy report, doctor? Cause of death by tomorrow. But I'll need a week for the full report. Good. I'll see you in my office on Monday. A solid mirror, like they used to make. I was just thinking that this mirror saw what happened. It's like a photographic plate that no one can develop. - Get more pictures before leaving. - Take your time. - Did you see all the fingerprints on this lampshade? - Blood stains, too. We'll make some blow-ups. No! No! No! No! Help! Help me! I don't want to die! Get me out of here! Help me! Help! Help!
