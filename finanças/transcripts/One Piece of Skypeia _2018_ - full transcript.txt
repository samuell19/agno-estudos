Here are your refreshments. Oh, thank you. Here you go, Nami-san. Thank you. Let me know anytime you want a refill. Hey, Usopp! Usopp! What? Don't bother me now-- Chopper! What in the world are they doing? I like how it's cheerful. Monkey D. Luffy, a boy who aspires to become the King of the Pirates, and his crew, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Chopper, added Nico Robin to the group at the desert kingdom Alabasta, and were continuing their journey on the Grand Line. Navigator-san, by the way... Is the Log Pose working? Straight to west-northwest! No problem! We're on our way! Okay. If I remember right, the island next to Alabasta is Autumn Island. Rain? What? Ouch. It's not rain... It's... A galleon?! How?! What is it? What?! Hey! What?! More stuff's falling! Watch out! Wow! Cool! What's happening?! Luffy, protect the ship! It can't take this! Okay! Count on-- What's this? Hey, Nami! I got something! This is no time for that! Why the heck did a ship fall from the sky? How weird! There's nothing in the sky... What's wrong, Nami-san? Our Log Pose is... ...broken! It's stuck pointing upwards! What should we do? We can't get to the next island without it! That's not it. What? It was updated by an island with stronger magnetism. What?! If the Log Pose needle is pointing upwards... ...that means the log has been caught by a sky island. Sky island?! Oh, yeah. Earlier, I found... What's that? Skypiea? A map of a sky island?! What?! No way... Does this mean that there's really an island in the sky?! Let's go, Nami! It's a dream island! We can go to a dream island! Yay! Awesome! Skypiea! Skypiea! Come on! --Skypiea! --How are we gonna get there? What? This map doesn't show how to get there! Even if there's a sky island, we don't know the way to get there! You're the navigator! Figure something out! There are some things you can't just "figure out," you know! Monsters! "One Piece Episode of Skypiea" "Jaya" It's good that we arrived at this island called Jaya, but if the Log Pose stays like this, we have no choice but to go to the sky island. Well, it'll be all right. All right. Nami-san! Your "Unprecedented takoyaki just for ladies" are ready! Well, I wasn't counting on you guys from the start. I got information. The town drawn on the left is Mock Town, where we are now. And you see an X on the other side, right? I heard a man who doesn't blend in on Jaya lives there. Doesn't blend in? "Eastern Coast, Jaya" --A... --Amazing! Idiots! Look closely. What the--?! It's just a board?! What?! Hello? I'm coming in! No one's home... Hello! "Noland the Liar" Hello! "Noland the Liar" "Noland the Liar" A picture book... A picture book... This is quite an old book. It's titled Noland the Liar. Wow, that's a cool title! "This is a story from long, long ago... A story that took place 400 long years ago. A man named Montblanc Noland lived in a North Blue country. Noland, an explorer, always talked about his incredible adventures. However, the villagers couldn't tell if those stories were true or not. One day, he reported to the king after coming back from his travels. "I saw a mountain of gold on an island in the great sea.' The courageous king set sail on the great sea to see if the story was true. After surviving great adventures, the king and Noland made it to the island. However, what they found there was just a jungle. In the end, he was sentenced to death for the crime of lying. Noland's last words were as follows: 'That's right! The mountain of gold sank in the sea!" The king and the others were dumbfounded. No one believed Noland any longer because Noland continued to lie until his very death. The end." Liars always end up miserable. Don't keep looking at me! Noland the Liar, huh? That takes me back. I often read it when I was a kid. You know it, Sanji-kun? But it says it was published in the North Blue. Yeah. I was born in the North Blue. This is a famous story in the North. There's a weird bird. You're right. What are you doing?! "Montblanc Cricket Last Boss of the Pirate Group 'Monkey Mountain Allied Force'" "Montblanc Cricket Last Boss of the Pirate Group "Monkey Mountain Allied Force'" Who the hell are you?! Who the hell are you?! You're after the gold, aren't you? Die! What? Hey, Usopp! Go grab Luffy! G-Got it! Sanji! Sanji-kun! Don't worry. It didn't hit me. The bends? Yeah, it's a sickness that divers sometimes get. Sorry I caused you trouble. I thought you were just more idiots after gold bullion. Gold bullion?! Pops, don't get up! Thank you, Doctor. You're quite skilled. Your compliment doesn't make me happy, you fool! What is it that you wanna ask me? Pops! Are those giant monkeys your pets? Is that what you had to ask?! They're Masira and Shojo. They're my underlings. I've been diving into the sea to search for gold every day. Nice! Then, one day, they suddenly came, saying they wanted to help search for gold. Well, putting the monkey story aside... Why even ask?! I wanna go to the sky island! Please tell us how to get there! You believe in the sky island? What?! There's no sky island? No one knows... I know someone who said there is. But people call him a legendary big liar, Montblanc Noland. There's a picture book about him called Noland the Liar. What? I'm Montblanc Cricket. Noland's my grandad's grandad's grandad's... He's my distant ancestor. The Montblanc family was driven out of the country then, and has kept a low profile. People continue to denounce our family to this day. But no one in the family hates him. Why? Because Noland was an extraordinarily honest person. Noland's last excuse in the picture book is like this: "That's right! The mountain of gold sank in the sea!" A stupid-looking face is drawn in this book, but he shed many tears and died a regrettable death. Noland insisted that the ruins had submerged due to crustal movements, but everyone thought he was making excuses out of desperation. In front of the laughing onlookers... ...Noland was executed. Oh, I see! You're looking for the city of gold on the seabed in order to clear the Montblanc family's name! No... If it's there, that's fine. If it's not there, that's fine, too. It's not that I want to prove his innocence. This is a duel with the man, Noland, who threw a wrench into my life. I wanna go to the sky island, Pops! Yeah, I did tell you, right? The witness to the sky island is that Noland the Liar. What?! A logbook?! Could it be Noland's? He mentions the sky island in it. What?! Let's see... Hurry up! Don't rush me! I heard there is a vehicle called a waver on the sky island. Oh, yeah! A waver! What? Let me see! It also says he saw skyfish. Skyfish?! Skyfish, huh? That's something to look forward to. It's such a valuable logbook. Look over here! "The sound of the giant bell made of gold resonated far and wide." So there's a gold bell! And here! "I saw gold in the skull's right eye." You're so quick at finding where it mentions gold. There's a strange phenomenon that occurs in these waters a few times a month. It'll turn to night even though it's the middle of the day. There are clouds known as "Imperiocumulus Clouds." When those giant clouds appear high in the sky, even sunlight is blocked out, bringing afternoon "nighttime" to the ground. Listen. If a sky island really does exist, that'd be the only possible place! What do you mean? Go above the Imperiocumulus Clouds by getting on the Monstrous Current! A current that shoots up into the air. That is called a Monstrous Current. The accepted theory goes like this: Deep beneath the sea floor, there are large cavities, and low-temperature sea water seeps into them. The heat from the earth below turns that water into steam, and the resulting pressure causes a huge explosion on the sea floor. It occurs five times a month. But if the sky island doesn't show up above the current when we rise up, we'll all slam into the sea surface and end up at the bottom of the sea. We reinforced your ship. Masira and Shojo did their job. Strength, speed, weight... All the adjustments are done. Go for it! Let's go to the sky island! How exciting! I thought we got blown away! The ship's going straight up a pillar of water! How is this happening?! We're not gonna fall?! All right! Go, Merry! Now we can go into the sky at once! It was falling... Yeah, it was... Definitely falling... What should we do?! Is that what'll happen to us?! We'll die! We'll slam into the sea and die! Spread the sails! Right away! What? This is the sea! Not just a pillar of water! It's a rising current! And the wind blowing from below is a rising air current produced by the geothermal heat and steam explosion! If we're dealing with wind and sea, I can navigate it! Who's this ship's navigator?! You are, Nami-san! We're gonna fall! We're gonna fall, Nami! Do something! No, we can make it! Awesome! The ship is flying! Is this for real?! Nami-san! You're wonderful! We did it! Kid! There's one thing that's a definite fact. No one in history's ever disproved the city of gold or the sky island. Right! People might laugh and call it foolish logic, but it's enough for me. That's what romanticism is all about! What's that? A wall of clouds?! We can't slow down... We'll plunge into it like this! Can't... Can't breathe...! What's happening?! An ocean in the sky? Clouds?! We're in the clouds? How are we staying on them?! Of course you can stay on them! They're clouds! No, you can't! You sure?! "God's Temple, Upper Yard" For six years... "God" For six years...

Must be hard to talk while you're biting your lower lip. How careless of me. So let's put an end to this island and set forth... ...for the world of dreams! What's the matter? A group of seven... They're trying to invade my country. Only the almighty God Eneru could tell that! He's out of our league! Somebody, give unto them Heaven's Judgment! I am the God. Wh-What the...?! What?! What's going on?! A lobster?! Where is he gonna take us?! Ask the lobster! What is this?! A river of clouds?! I don't think it's naturally occurring. It's definitely unnatural! Something's written there! "Godland"... ..."Skypiea"? An island! It's a sky island! Are you Blue Sea people? What's that? Who are you?! I am the Sky Knight. "Blue Sea people" is the term for those who live beneath the clouds. In other words, did you come up here from the Blue Sea? Yeah. That's right. Old guy, what are you drinking? This? Pumpkin juice. It's my favorite. That sounds delicious. Hey! There are so many other important things that we have to ask! Is that a skyfish?! I wonder if it tastes good! Hey! Pierre! "'Sky Knight' Gan Fall" "'Sky Knight' Gan Fall" I am the Sky Knight! "'Sky Knight' Gan Fall" "'Sky Knight' Gan Fall" Gan Fall! "'Sky Knight' Gan Fall" --Yay! --Old guy, you're strong! --Yay! Oh, no!

There's no sail to catch the wind... How did you propel it on the sea? Oh, you mean you're not familiar with dials? Dials? Seashells like this. This is a little small, but it's a Wind Dial. The waver moves by blowing wind that was stored in this Wind Dial. Oh... That's amazing! Guys! Hey, she's riding it! How awesome! This is like a dream! Yahoo! Yeah! It's so cool! Gee! I can ride it, too! Hey! What is he doing? Seems like he's a power-user, but this sea has no bottom. What?! Jeez! He almost dropped through the bottom! I felt... my foot... coming out of... the cloud... Heso! I found you, criminals! Criminals?! Did we do something? Who are you? "Satori of the Forest God's Vassal of Skypiea" My name is Satori!

Don't we have to take care of them? Not now! It's more important that... ...we don't miss this chance! They're gone... Looks like we're not their targets. Who are they? They're... the Shandorians! They're guerrillas who rebel against God Eneru and his vassals. "'Sky Breeder' Ohm God's Vassal of Skypiea" "'Sky Boss' Gedatsu God's Vassal of Skypiea" That was close! I almost got involved. Don't tell me... this island is... Sky Knight! What did you do?! I can't move! Is something wrong, Gan Fall?! This is my String Challenge! Don't assume you can match me in midair! If you want a shoulder, you can have one. An impact, huh?! Such things can't defeat me! No, it's ten times the energy. Reject! The long-standing battle between the Shandorians and the people who live on the sky island... It began 400 years ago... ...when the Great Warrior Calgara, who was protecting Shandora, the city of gold, met a man. "400 Years Ago" Calgara was a brave warrior who single-handedly sank many pirate ships to protect his people. "Great Warrior Calgara" to protect his people. "Great Warrior Calgara" That year, they had a bad crop, and the Shandorians became sick one after another. They feared it was the work of an evil spirit, and decided to offer the Kashi God, a giant snake believed to be the village's protective god, a young girl as a sacrifice. At the same time, a visitor arrived on the island. "Montblanc Noland Admiral of an Expedition Ship From Lvneel Kingdom of North Blue" A the same time, a visitor arrived on the island. "Montblanc Noland Admiral of an Expedition Ship From Lvneel Kingdom of North Blue" "Montblanc Noland Admiral of an Expedition Ship From Lvneel Kingdom of North Blue" His name was Montblanc Noland. His name was Montblanc Noland. As soon as he entered the forest, he noticed the plague that was ravaging the island. It's the Kinetsu plague. He hasn't been treated at all. Doctor! Do we have any Conine left?! Inject this lad and all of us immediately! In exchange for this girl's life, please save our village! The ceremony is over. You must've been really frightened. You're safe now! There's no need to die! I am an explorer from the North Blue, Montblanc Noland-- It doesn't matter who you are! Is this how you've eliminated all the few, yet vital, advancements?! You're in no place to criticize! Atone to the gods where you stand! There! Use that knife to take your life! What?! A sacrifice meant to save the village, crying because she wants to live... Have you no shame?! Don't be a fool! Stop! The deadly sin of God-killing! You, alone, won't be enough! You and all your men will pay with your lives! "Lives" this, "sacrifices" that! Will those make your gods happy?! These ceremonies are insults to all of us! Give me time! I'll banish this so-called curse of yours! And if I can't, you can do whatever you like! In return, if I do save this village from tragedy, swear to me you'll never hold these ceremonies again! To save the village from the crisis, Noland went into the forest alone, but at that time, suddenly, an anomaly appeared on the earth. Noland got stuck in a fissure and couldn't get himself out. Calgara, who believed in gods, thought that they gave him a crushing blow. What you're doing is less than human! You think so? Even if the girl you saved yesterday... ...was my daughter?! You would tell your own daughter to end her life?! It's you people who don't understand how much power there is in the words our Pandori hear from the gods! Obeying them is the way of this village! I can't beg an exception just because she's my child! The Kashi God?! It must be the Kashi God's child! Sixty years ago, my own land lost hundreds of thousands of lives to the Kinetsu plague that is ravaging your village now! But, in recent years, there've been absolutely no deaths to this disease! Do you know why?! Because we discovered a cure for it! What I'm holding in my right hand is the bark of a Cona tree! The Conine I can extract from it is the cure! If I return with this, I can save the village! Do you know how many man-hours have been spent around the world, and how many victims there have been?! And you people are trampling all over this great advancement! That's why I say your "ceremonies” are insults to those people! Are you that afraid of gods?! Answer me. What did I just kill?! A snake. No! I just broke our commandments and killed a god! But you call it a snake! And you call the deadly curse that kills our villagers a curable disease! Will you really save my beloved village?! Can you save it?! I can! Hey, Calgara! Look at this! What a shock! I didn't know that snake had a grandchild... "That snake"? A snake, huh? Soon, the village was saved by the cure that Noland made. "Shandora, City of Gold" "Shandora, City of Gold" The city of gold... "Shandora, City of Gold" It's like I'm dreaming! This bell's ringing has words to it. Words? So that the spirits of our ancestors who were greeted by the heavens can return to this land at any time without getting lost, we continue to ring this bell, as a way to say, "We are right here." We call this bell the "Light of Shandora." That explains why it has such a majestic sound! Do you think so?! Yes! I heard this bell in a storm... ...where it shouldn't have been audible. Noland and his people thought they had a good relationship with the Shandorians, but one day, they were rejected. The reason was that Noland and the others had, without permission, cut down Ancestor Trees that were important to the Shandorians. Botanist, my ass! But that was a misunderstanding. I see. Those trees were where their ancestors' spirits dwell... We've done something that can never be taken back... The villagers are right to be angry. But, Admiral! We had no choice, given-- No excuses! I only did what satisfied me! I'm told that aside from proclaiming the city's existence, that bell also served to guide their ancestors' spirits to the island. And we cut down... ...those trees! What?! Leave all the gold behind?! Dad! Go quickly and stop them! Don't be a fool! You know what they've done! If we part now, we'll regret it for the rest of our lives! It'll probably sound like an excuse... ...but for the admiral's honor, I must say this. Those woods of yours were already dead. What?! The true horror of the Kinetsu plague is that it can also infect plant life. It was because he knew this that the admiral pleaded with you without regard for his own life. From people to forest, forest to people... Several small islands have been destroyed in exactly that way. But there's nothing to worry about now. We finished checking the entire forest yesterday. I'm sorry that we cut down your beloved woods without knowing or explaining... It'd probably still be unforgivable even with an explanation, but a botanist would never harm a forest without good reason. The admiral doesn't hate gods and spirits and stuff... It's just that he always knows... ...what's most important. I'm sorry, Noland! Don't go yet! At that moment, the bell rang loudly. As though it was trying to rebuild a precious friendship that was almost lost to a misunderstanding. It rang beautifully. Noland! Calgara... Come back again! Noland... I'll be waiting for you here! I'll keep on ringing the bell! So that your ship won't get lost at sea when you return... So that you won't lose sight of this island during a storm... I'll ring this bell and wait for you! Let's meet again... my friend! It's okay to come back? I will... I will come back again! We'll meet again! I promise you! Oh! There it is! The Going Merry! Nami-san! Robin-chan! Coots-chan! Seems like they're all okay! Hey! According to Noland's picture book, when he revisited Jaya years later, the ruins of gold were no longer there. We know why now. Before Luffy and the others returned, Zoro, Robin, and I went to check. Look over here! Is that...? The "city of gold" that once existed on the ground and was seen by Noland... ...didn't sink into the ocean. For 400 years... This part of Jaya has been... flying in the sky all this time! This is the other half of the island that was ripped up. This island was part of Jaya! See! This is how Jaya looked 400 years ago! Whoa! It looks like a skull! Well? Awesome! Noland was referring to the shape of the entire island. But only half of it is left now, so nobody could solve the mystery! I see! Then, the "skull's right eye" is... Right here! "I saw gold in the skull's right eye." Treasure! We did it! Way to go, Nami-san! It's a nice morning. I no longer have to hear the voices of the same old lower-world losers. You guys, even if you're only doing it to kill your boredom, you're too careless. Like Satori and Shura, if you have a pathetic showing, I won't take you to the Endless Varse! Then, it's complete? Now, let's play the game! Everyone, look at the map. We're here now. The search team will go this way. This "right eye" should have some sort of ruins, so watch out for enemies and bring some gold back! You make it sound so simple... All right, let's get going! Yeah! Chopper, you've got a lot of spunk! I thought this forest would be a scarier place, but it's not so bad! Run! It's a giant snake! How the hell can something so big move so fast?! Poison?! I think we should run away... Definitely. Yikes! It is said that Upper Yard appeared in Skypiea some 400 years ago. Until then, Skypiea had been a peaceful sky island. Items from the Blue Sea that sporadically rode up the Monstrous Current were valuable to the sky people. Sky people? That's us who live in Skypiea. Okay. All the earth on the sky islands came into the sky in this way. But earth the size of Upper Yard was an unimaginable miracle. Neither greenery nor soil is naturally found in the sky. We call the earth "Varse" with a sense of admiration. And those people who shot up into the sky with the Varse are the Shandorians, indigenous people living on Upper Yard. So those guerrillas originally lived on Jaya in the world below? Yet you guys kicked them off the island? Yes. The sky people stole their homeland due to their own greed. The Shandorians are simply trying to take back their homeland. Wyper! You wanna die?! I can't believe you used the Reject Dial! If you use it one more time, your body's gonna blow up! Wyper! I'm a descendant of the Great Warrior Calgara! I'll take back the Varse... and bring back the Light of the Shandorians! The Light of the Shandorians? It's impossible... The bell of the Shandorians... doesn't exist! You think I didn't know?! You've searched through Upper Yard, but you can't find the bell! It's just a myth! Shut up! Today... ...Eneru's head will roll! Who is this "God Eneru"? Until six years ago, I was God. Did you hit your head, old man? When I was God, he suddenly appeared from some sky island and took control of Upper Yard. My Divine Squad was defeated by them and is now being forced to do hard labor somewhere. That's already over. Eneru! It's been a while, former God Gan Fall! You son of a-- I won't hurt you as long as you stay quiet. Understood? What are you up to?! Give me back my subordinates! They worked very hard for me. Thanks to them, I have no use for this island anymore. Oh, I decided to play a game! What?! It's a game in which the survivors are winners! The participants are 50 from my side. Twenty Shandorians. From the Blue Sea people, the four that entered the forest. And the one here. Me, too?! The wounded old man can't fight, obviously. Seventy-five people in total! How many of them will remain after three hours? That's the point of the game! How many do you think? Five! Wait! Eneru! This is terrible! I wish Chopper were here... I'm sorry, but I've got to chase Eneru! Hey! Are you gonna leave us ladies?! Jeez! Thus, on Upper Yard, the survival game between the Straw Hats, Eneru's Divine Squad, and the Shandorians began. One Million Volt Varie! Whoops. Twenty voices disappeared after that discharge. Cloven... ...Cross! I can go below! This is Shandora, the city of gold! What was that?! Burn... Gum-Gum... --...Bazooka! --...Bazooka! I think I recognize this place... Or not... No, I do. Did you laugh just now?! Huh?! Hey! Wait! Hey! Dammit! Let go! Ruins up here, too! What's with this place?! The ground's all crooked... What? What are you looking for? The gold you're looking for isn't here any longer. Come to think of it, I can't find any. It must be you who took it from here. Gold is a nice thing. That glittering metal suits me well. Then you took the golden bell that used to be here, too? Golden bell? Hey, let me down! You stupid bird! You little--! That took its toll...! That bird's gonna pay! Chopper! Such a shame. Do you want to get revenge now or something? I don't like to fight with a motive. But... ...I can feel one coming on. The Dial Boat in the back seems worn out, so I'll go check. Okay. Nami-san? No! No! Go away! Golden bell, huh? What did you learn by reading the letters? Nothing. Unfortunately, if it wasn't here when you first came, it didn't come to the sky after all. No, wait... Yes! It's here. It's here... in the sky! When this island was blown into the sky 400 years ago, it's said that the chimes of a bell rang. I see! That bell was made of gold! Wonderful! I've already taken aim at your heart. Pray to God, swordsman from the Blue Sea! You fool! I'll never pray to God! First, 36-pound... Second, 72-pound... Third, 108-pound... Three-Sword Style! 108-Pound Phoenix! No way... The Iron Clouds were repelled! No! What is that Blue Sea person doing?! What?! Sango Smash! Oh, the weird knight! Damn! What're you--?! I invited your friends here! Why have this many chunks of ruins fallen from above? Swordsman-san! Don't tell me you fell all the way down here with these... The giant snake is acting strange. It looks like it's looking for something... Hey, weird knight! Pierre! Stay with me! What happened to that bird?! I guess when he landed, he hit his head hard. Is it possible... that this place is...? This is our homeland? The bell! Where's the bell?! It's not here. Eneru! Oops! Ball Cloud! Wait a little. The game isn't over yet. Game, you said?! I started a survival game three hours ago. My guess was that there'd be five survivors including me. That's exactly five people, right? Good, he hasn't noticed I'm here. In three minutes, it'll be three hours. In other words, it won't do if there're six people here right now. Doh! He knew! God's prophecy cannot fail. Let's see, who shall disappear? You are the one who should disappear! A bad choice. What an annoying snake! El Thor! A Devil Fruit's power?! It's probably the Rumble-Rumble Fruit. Among the many kinds of powers, it's one of those said to be "invincible." The power of lightning! Eneru! I've just come from God's temple up above. A tragedy... It was utterly destroyed! Just what is your goal?! There is a place I must return to. Land has a place for land! Humans have a place for humans! And the God has a place for the God! Each has a place to which it must return! D-Don't tell me you... That's right. I will drag down every human from this sky! Return everything to nothing! What?! You're going to destroy the country! That is only natural. Don't be conceited, Eneru! This is a world of humans! There is no such thing as "God"! 20 Million Volt... ...Varie! Well, it's exactly the time that I prophesied. Now there are five! I'm glad you've survived! I shall bring you along with me to the Endless Varse that I'm setting off to! And what if we refuse? What? Who said we're coming with you? We just want you to get out of our way! Oh, boy... Then... ...you'd better die here. Robin! She's a woman! I can see that. Until I teach your body a lesson, you probably won't understand our overwhelming difference in power. Burn Bazooka! Kari Krash! Can't be! He erased the bazooka's powerful fire! You still don't get it, do you? The energy that you can handle is nothing to me. 30 Million Volt... ...Hino Bird Zap! Lightning Beast Kiten! I don't believe it...! Even Zoro! Follow me... I'll show you something interesting. "God" "God" This is the Ark Maxim. "God" "God" In this ship, we can travel to the Endless Varse! "God" This can't be real... I made it out! Cool! Where am I?! It looks like ruins. So it's here? The huge golden bell? Zoro! Hey! What're you doing?! How could this happen... ...when you were here?! Luffy... Robin! Navigator-san... was taken. As I thought, it's apparently not one of the five that survived... What? How truly irritating... It means my prophecy was wrong. Are you the guy? Are you Eneru?! Luffy! What did you do... to my crew? Watch your mouth! I am the God. I don't see anything God-like about you! I don't see anything God-like about you! You'll know soon enough. You're only a Paramethia. You haven't got a chance! Luffy! El Thor! Luffy... It seems that you dodged it well... 60 Million Volt Lightning Dragon! Luffy! 100 Million Volt Varie! Is it possible that lightning doesn't affect Luffy? Stop it! Because he's rubber? It could be... that Luffy is Eneru"s one and only... ...natural enemy! What the hell... are you?! I'm Luffy. I'm a pirate and a rubber man. Rubber? Lightning doesn't work on me! Mantra... Gum-Gum-- Gum-Gum... Gatling! Luffy! Once I know lightning won't work, I'll fight accordingly. Max 200 Million Volt Varie! Don't tell me... I don't have time to play with the likes of you. I'm God. I am creating the world as I see fit. What is that?! It's a thundercloud. Look! Something is floating in the sky! Everyone! Please escape right away! Eneru is planning on obliterating this island! Huh? He what?! Don't be ridiculous! She's telling the truth! There is an imminent danger! Everyone! Leave the country! What creepy clouds... What on earth is he up to? Luffy and Navigator-san are on that ship, too? What's that?! The thunderclouds are turning spherical... I'll show you something interesting. Witness true divine power! The sky's falling! Kingdom Come! Feast your eyes, rubber man, on the falling island's despair. No one can stop it now. Stop it! Luminous Forge! Ow! Ouch! Luffy! Oh, no! Luffy! Damn you! Fight me! Eneru! He's just an idiot whose body happens not to be affected by lightning! I don't want... If I have to abandon those guys and go with you like this, I don't want any of it anymore! Including your life? Or would you rather place your hope in the two rats that've snuck on? What? It seems they're serious about rescuing you. How utterly ridiculous. Do you remember the name of the Great Warrior Calgara's close friend? Montblanc Noland. That's right. Calgara vowed he'd keep on ringing the bell for him. "Bring back the Light of Shandora"? Right. But the sound of the bell didn't reach Noland. Marie Jois has... ...finally granted us permission to enter the Grand Line. As such, I wish to send you on another mission. Yes, it would be my pleasure! But I've decided my soldiers will join you on this journey, as will I. Understood? Yes! Calgara! Seto. You're off to ring the bell, right? I'll help. Hey, Nola. You've sure settled into these ruins! Say! When do you suppose Noland-san and the others will come? That's all you ever ask when you come here. It won't be so easy for him to come back. He was born in the far northern seas. He also has a family back home. But he did promise. As long as we keep ringing this bell here, he'll show up sooner or later... What's this?! This looks bad! Come, Seto! We have to protect the village! Why? Why does the island drop off here? You fool! Did you deceive me?! Where is all the gold you said there'd be?! Where did the village go?! What happened to this island?! Calgara! If you're alive, let me hear it! The sound of the gold bell! Answer me, Light of Shandora! Noland's public execution's about to start! Hey! This way, guys! Six years ago, I saw a giant city of gold on the Grand Line island called Jaya! The city of gold does exist! Then let's hear from one of your crewmen. Is this man telling the truth? No. It's an absolute lie. What?! Noland-san is a liar?! Then were all his stories fake?! What a horrific man! He lied to the whole kingdom and acted like a hero! Who's that witness?! He's not part of our crew! Did you see Calgara and the others?! Admiral! What happened?! Seize them! Dammit! M-Men... For his heinous lies, Montblanc Noland the Explorer is hereby sentenced... ...to death by beheading! Liar! --Liar! --Liar! He's a liar! The admiral'd never lie! Admiral! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar...! At that time, the bell rang. It truly sounded like a voice singing in praise of that miraculous land. God-sama! It's a giant Varse! Yes. Did you hear that? The singing voice of this beautiful Varse... It is truly the birth of holy land. That is where... ...I must live! What happened?! What is this?! I can't breathe well! Is everyone all right?! Pull yourselves together! Tend to the wounded! Hurry! Calgara! Intruders! I hereby claim this Varse as mine! I am God! That's no God! Stop them, warriors! We cannot let him take this land! We made a promise, didn't we, Noland...? We said we'd meet again someday. Calgara... Where are you now? When you return to Jaya, what will you think when you see we're gone? Just wait a little longer! I'm going to tell you! That we're right here! Are you alive...? I have so much to tell you... Calgara... I'm just worried for your safety... Let's meet again someday, no matter what, Noland! Bring back the Light of Shandora! Bring back... the Light of Shandora! Robin! Luffy?! What's that gold on your arm?! Robin! The gold bell is at the top of this vine, right?! What?! And Eneru's after it, right?! That's right! All right, then! The bell! The gold bell is up there?! You're going for it, too? If it does exist, it'd have to be there. But Eneru's already after it. Where are my shooter and bazooka? Your shoes were smashed up, so I left them below. Your bazooka, too. What?! When I transported you, I noticed that you were all beat up. Thunder Ball! You amuse me, girl. It worked! But... But it won't help you if I change the scale! I'm busy. Begone! You begone! Special Attack! Exploding Star! ...I'm sorry! Usopp! So it was you, huh? I met you on the boat... Glance-- Usopp! Nami! What? Save me. Screw that! The waver! Let's jump off on that! Jump off?! Are you crazy?! At this height-- If we can land on the Island Clouds in the center of the forest...! I see! Usopp! Grab on! Usopp! Go. Sanji-kun! El... ...Thor! So they jumped off... But they haven't escaped me in the slightest. Hey, God... There's one thing I wanted to say... No, but first... Thanks... I was just thinking... how I wanted a light... And? What else? Oh... Drop dead... No... you didn't! Damn you! What were you doing inside the ship just now?! Damn you, Blue Sea person! Nami fell safely onto some Island Clouds! Usopp Hopping! Long-nose-kun?! Yes. There they are! Navigator-san! What? Luffy went up?! Yes. Okay. I'll go after him on the waver! We gotta get off this island! This ship is not so easily brought down. Now, then. I'm above Giant Jack. I doubt anyone would come searching for something in these skies above God's temple. Where is the golden bell...? Brilliant! This is the great bell tower, the pride of the legendary city, Shandora! Wonderful! As the God, I'll take this with me and finish my ascent to the Endless Varse! Luffy! What? Nami! What're you doing here?! It's bigger than the last one! That bastard! Luffy! Get on so we can go back down! I can't. You can't? Why not?! Even if I don't have to save you now, I still have unfinished business here! Will you quit it, already?! You-- You saw it yourself! Saw what? The city of gold... it existed! What? He's gonna ring the bell? Yeah. It is important that we, the inheritors of Calgara's wishes, ring that bell! What does this have to do with Straw Hat?! Four hundred years ago, an explorer told a lie that he saw the city of gold. Although people laughed at him, his descendants believed his words and are still searching for this city of gold. That's why Luffy... It wasn't a lie! He wasn't lying! So I have to let the old guy and the others below know... ...that the city of gold was in the sky! Luffy... I can't let Eneru take it! I'm sure the huge bell can be heard from anywhere... ...so I'm gonna ring that golden bell! Oh! Watch out! Some... Something's falling! Everyone, heads down! What? What's that? "Cut down this huge vine so it falls towards the west." Is it from Nami?! Reject! We're gonna jump, Luffy! Okay! Here I come, Eneru! Gimme the golden bell! They're a bunch of... Enough of this! I'm sick of you! Kingdom Come! Disappear with the land! Nami, thanks! There's no way I'll let your help go to waste! Huh? What?! Gum-Gum Fireworks! Golden Peony! What is this abnormal electric discharge?! That's right...! He has gold, which can transmit electricity, on his hand! Let the sun shine! Ring it! Straw Hat! The "Light of Shandora"! Here I come! I'll ring it, and you right along with it! You insolent brat! 200 Million Volt Amaru! Gum-Gum... ...Golden Rifle! Reach! Reach! When you return to Jaya, what will you think when you see we're gone? Just wait a little longer! I'm going to tell you! That we're right here! Bring back the Light of Shandora! I saw a giant city of gold on the Grand Line island called Jaya! The city of gold does exist! Reach! No one in history's ever disproved the city of gold or the sky island. That's what romanticism is all about! Reach! Sorry to have kept you waiting so long, Montblanc Noland. I hope this reaches your descendants! Can you hear it?! Old diamond-head! Monkeys! The city of gold was... ...there! This is romanticism. My ancestor wasn't a liar. You rang it to tell me that from the sky... Right, kid? The city of gold was there, huh?! I appreciate it. The sound of the bell was the "Light of Shandora,” which boasted of the glories of the vanished city. It declared the end of the fighting with a love song, the "Song of the Island"... After being silenced for 400 years, the golden bell fulfilled its promise. Once, its people entrusted words to the sound of that bell. "We are right here." It rang... Yeah. I wonder... if the old guy and the others heard it. Yeah, I'm sure of it. My heart throbs at the thought of you Limitless power surges As long as you wish, we'll brandish our unchanging bond We are hope The joy of letting our true feelings fly at each other The pain from how we laughed our heads off to dry our tears We connect them together and in the wind Ah It's fluttering higher and higher Why did you give up on your search? Why do you keep fighting by yourself? Say, what kind of future did you prepare for? Have you fulfilled your dream? My heart throbs at the thought of you Limitless power surges If you're bemused, let's wish quietly to the world for a sunrise Close your eyes and listen carefully Let's look for your answer As long as you wish, we'll brandish our unchanging bond We are hope At the broad, blue end of the world There is a place I have to return to with you The sea route that we take decided long ago in the past
