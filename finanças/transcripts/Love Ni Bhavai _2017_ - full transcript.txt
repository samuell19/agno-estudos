Yes, I am on my way. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Sorry. I am coming. Take your time. I just thought of reminding you that half a million listeners are waiting. I hate you, Krishna. From the aroma of the coffee To the golden rays of sunlight Every morning feels like a new one After slowly waking up From the world of sweet dreams Every morning feels beautiful Like a tune on the radio Like a song sung by the birds Infinite songs fill my heart Infinite musical notes Are calling out to me Wake up Wake up and get up It's a beautiful morning Fly high in the sky Dance and rejoice this morning I love you, morning I love you, morning I love you, love you I love you, morning Why are you so late today? Actually, I had a problem today. -The shower was not functioning... -Not you. I know you're always late. I was talking to him. Were you jogging or were you talking with someone? I am tired. I can't get along with her. She's always shouting. Am I still a child? Come closer. Come a little bit closer. Open your mouth. Okay. He has definitely smoked about three to four cigarettes. You can keep shouting at him. Hey! You always take her side. That's a lie. Antra never lies. Wake up Run and run The delicious combination of flavor and aroma that can only come from Paras Chili. It will make you... Who will listen to the radio when there are so many advertisements? Traffic is always in a jam Hey, hero! Make way I am not interested in waiting Hey, miss. Listen. You can't park here. You've blocked the entrance. Listen, miss. Tell whoever is going to park next to move it, okay? She never listens to anyone. I'm sure you don't read the newspapers. Antra, listen. This political scenario is very important. We must cover it in the second link. RJ is busy with something else. He won't listen to me. -Hey, K. -Yes. Tell me something. Should I get a dog? I think that you should get a boyfriend. Yes, sure. Will he be available given his tight schedule? Come on, hurry up. It's late. Link 1 is about to start. An apple in the studio? You know that apples aren't allowed in the studio. An Apple phone is allowed, but not the fruit? -This is unfair. -Antra. Sweet fights are yet to make Let this morning halt for a moment Wake up and get up It's the beautiful morning I love you, love you I love you, morning What was the saying? If you really desire something from your heart, then the universe will help you get what you want. That's a big conspiracy. I mean, I don't know what is wrong with the universe, but today, trouble keeps coming my way. I know, I am late. What can a poor girl do? First of all, I was solving a murder mystery at midnight. I had gotten the last clue. Just like Daya, I was about to break open the door, and then... And then my alarm rang. First, the mystery in my dream remained unsolved. And then my shower gave up on me. That's not all. While balancing an apple, my bag, my shoes, and coffee in one hand, I finally got to the office. I came in late, but I came in one piece. It's a fun rise with the sunrise, only on Love Line. Live from your heart. Okay, you have any interesting, funny, or weird news? Take this. Anything else? Shall I write down the link for you? Don't taunt me. Where's the monkey? I don't know. Maybe he's on his way. None of you come on time. Don't act smart. After 20 years of being married, a husband drove away his wife for not cooking his favorite dishes. God might be late, but he always does his work. Ma'am, do you have to party? Seriously. If you're listening to me, then trust me. You're all set, boss. And for the man, just marry a chef. And then you will be happy. On 94.3 MY FM. -Hey, stop. Stop. -Greetings, Ahemdabad. -You're with RJ. -Hold this. Live from your heart. Does this look like sweat? Does this look like sweat? Idiot. Antra, don't forget RJ's message in the next link. It's very important. See. The producer of the show enters after the show has started. No, actually. My scooter got a flat tire. So I had to push it for a while. Then I got it repaired. Where could you get it repaired at 7:30 in the morning? -It's near my house. -Where? Nehru Nagar. I just came from there. None of the car repair shops are open. Jaydev, give him some water. I gave him some, but he didn't drink. Why? He just poured it on himself. Not "sorry." Say this, "I am a monkey." Hey, I am not a monkey. I'm Manan Kapadiya. Here's your coffee. I have a severe headache. I think I have to drink more tea. Boss, that's exactly my point. What? Tea is like marriage. It's like that couple in the newspaper. People drink tea because they have to, not because they want to. And your bitter coffee? -It's like the hot girlfriend. -Or boyfriend? Yes, or a boyfriend, with whom people share a special time. They spend hours enjoying each other's company. Tea is routine. Coffee is special. The person with whom you share the coffee or tea with makes it special. How many references will you use to teach me about love? Until you believe in love. In your dreams. -But K. -Yes. I think Salman will marry before me. What do you think? This years' Young Achiever Award of Media goes to... RJ Antra. Cheers to all those who broke up in your show. Who does a show to win awards? Right! Who does a show to win awards? I do it, only to help lost lovers get back to living their life. So this is Antra, the most popular RJ in Ahmedabad. She's surrounded by people, but is really all alone. She is always smiling, but she's quiet, as if she's in constant search of something. Whether she's sipping coffee alone on her balcony, or when she's jumping from a height of 100 feet. She's fond of adventure sports. But the biggest adventure of her life is on its way, and she's unaware of it. So, let's begin with your favorite segment. Your questions and Antra's answers. "Love ni Bhawai." Antra, my girlfriend wants to take a selfie with me every day. How do I refuse her? Tell this to her next time, "Let's take a selfie. Your friends say that I look cute." He's always busy with Facebook and WhatsApp. What do I do? It's very simple. Open your account on Facebook, and write "I love you" on his wall. He will then deactivate his account. Swati. Tell me, Swati. What do you want to say? Actually, I don't know why I called you. You can talk to me casually. Now that you've called, let's talk. Are you single or committed? Actually, I have a boyfriend. But, nothing. Swati, people in love say that they love each other. They never say, "He loves me." Swati? No, it's not that. Okay, let me ask you. What's your boyfriend's name? Sagar. She's Sagar's girlfriend. Where is he? Where's Sagar? What are you all talking about? We've been waiting for Sagar since this morning. Call him up. Message him on WhatsApp. Take a cab and bring him out of his house. Yes, correct. This is perfect! Welcome. Welcome, sir. Welcome. And go on! Keep taking selfies. Take as many as you want. With as many people as you want. And while all the computers in the office are down, you will take selfies. -I wasn't taking a selfie. -Then what were you doing? I was taking a photo. And informing my boss that I've arrived at your office. -Is it? -Yes. Come here, you fool. Do you think I will believe you? Are you trying to fool me? Do I need to fool you? What? What did you say? -I will throw you out. -Software. There was no need to code any software. You should have called me. I would be here immediately. -Now, let's go. -Come on, make way. Make way. I need to do all of this very carefully. Everything is messed up. Listen. Yes. Why are you all looking at me like that? I get performance pressure. Please, go back to your work. Pintu. -Yes, Sagar. -Come here. -Please sing me a song. -What? Look at their faces. Sing me a song. I'm feeling really nervous. -Come on, sing a song -Start, idiot. Sanedo, Red Sanedo Try and understand if you can Sanedo Red Sanedo It's done. Come on, everyone. Get back to work. The problem is solved. Wow, son. May God bless you! Yes, definitely. But you better bless me now. Here's your bill. Yes, bill. Of course. I must pay your bill. -Such a big amount? -Yes. Do you want a check or my kidney? Here's the bill. -Hey! -What? Sir, do you want fast service for the price of an ordinary one? You might be a sweet talker, but you're a genius at work. You're amazing. Come on, give me the money. Here. Count it. -Sir. -Yes. I don't need to count the money in selected transactions. Wow, that's great. Yes, Mehul. Did you listen to Antra? Swati was there. What Swati? What Antra? -Who's this Antra? -Hey, Antra. -The radio jockey. -Is she the one? My wife listens to her radio program every day. Swati was on a call with her today. You can tell me if you had a fight or something. There are many women named Swati in the city. Why do you think of my Swati only? Hang up now. Mehul. He's totally crazy. -I heard something. -What? "My Swati." I mean, your Swati. Who's this Swati? Sir, she's my girlfriend. Save the date! It's in June. You must attend my wedding. I would go even if you didn't invite me. Go! Selfie. Just one selfie. Stop flirting, you've been caught now. Madam, will you eat momos today? I don't have any cabbage. There's nothing else. This is not enough to make momos. This is Antra's boyfriend. This is her 2-minute relationship. Maggi noodles can turn her bad days into good ones. If there would ever be a boy in her life, he would be her number two. Hey, move! Stop honking, please. What's your problem? What's the problem? People have a habit of finding shortcuts. So, naturally, a traffic jam will occur. Sir, please relax. Just a minute. Please. Please, keep quiet. Don't honk. One minute. Move little bit this side. You move back little. Wait a minute. You, sir, please go. Please. Just a minute. There's an ambulance. There's an ambulance. Please, get back. Antra. All of my friends have girlfriends except me. All of them tease me a lot. -Listen. Do you have PS4? -Yes. That's better. At least you will have the control. Yes, okay. "Love ni Bhawai." We have been married for 25 years. Now, we are just living together. But we don't feel like we're together. Sir, have you shared this feeling of yours with your wife? -No. -That's it. Your love is hidden in those unshared feelings. Start sharing everything that you have in your heart. I love you, morning I love you, love you I love you, morning To welcome our next young awardee, I would like to call to the stage, the young and emerging politician. Please, welcome Mr. S. K. Pujara. Usually, we wake up with our alarms. But Ahemdabad wakes up with Antra. Today, I'm reminded of my school teacher. She had told me to start studying and to stop speaking. Thank God, I stopped studying, but not speaking. I just want to say, please speak up. Speak up if you don't like something. And you must speak up if you like something. If your thoughts or ideas are kept in your heart, you won't be able to get anything out of them. That's all I want to say. Under the section of education, he has transformed 35 municipal schools into smart schools. I had started with a small thought. I've heard a lot of discussions on the problem of the education system. And then I realized, that if we think of the solution, instead of discussing this problem, then the world will be a better place to stay in. Very good, isn't it? What? I was stuck in a traffic jam just a few days ago. The traffic was really heavy. I was stuck there for 45 minutes. Because of their frustration, people were honking and shouting. And suddenly, a girl came on the road and she took the initiative to clear the traffic, Soon people joined her. And within five minutes, she managed to clear the traffic. By the way, that girl was none other than your favorite RJ Antra. Everyone who is here becomes a part of such solutions. -Exactly. -K! Yes. Shall we go now, K? Aditya. Krishna. I'm Antra's boss. Well, I am sorry I don't listen to the radio that much. No, don't be. I also don't listen to it. Everyone listens to her. But she doesn't listen to anyone. You two can keep talking, I'll join you soon. Okay. So how long have you been in that field? You're always the center of attention. Don't you feel tired? They give me 24 hours of their time, and expect just 5 seconds for a selfie. It's their right. I must give it to them. Are you originally from Ahemdabad? You can address me informally. And if our conversation is going to be little longer, then I need to eat something. I am hungry. Relax, I am just joking. It occupies space on the plate as well as in the stomach. I will eat proper food. Well, I am not a regular radio listener. But I will definitely listen to you. Every time I visualized you With my eyes closed I've seen you much more than what you are Give it. -Sagar. -Yes? Are you all going to celebrate Valentine's Day with just your friends? Hey, listen. This Valentine's Day is very special. Why is that? I am going to propose to Swati. To Swati? Sagar, you had 23 breakups until now. Do you think you will succeed this time? Yes. This time I can really feel it. She's the final one. She will definitely say yes. -On this note, let me say something. -Please go ahead. "The band will play in his marriage. The band will play in his marriage." -Great. -Yes. Stop. "After marriage, you will see blisters on his entire body." -Well said. -Slap him. You might spill the tea. One more! -It was very nice. -Can you repeat that? She was better. -I'll tell you once I remember. -Have tea. Swati. -I will also contribute. -I will, too. Give it. It's busy. Hey, Manan. Look at this. Hey. They look good together, don't they? Why do you put him up to it? You know Antra. She will fry him in a moment. Really? -Let's try it. -No. -Let me fry you. -No. -Right, monkey? Come on. -No. Come on, monkey. Come on. -Come on. -Don't call me a monkey. I will throw this mic at you. "She will fry him." Still, you look good together. Please don't make any rumors about me. Hi. Aditya here. Can we talk for a minute? People are talking all over the city. That's the problem. You give solutions to everyone, but you can't give me one? Ignore it. How can I ignore it? For the first time, I'm on the gossip page instead of the business page. And these people used my old photo. You know what? People are congratulating me. People will always say something. It's their job. But what do you want to say? I wanted to ask you if we can meet. But it will be a little awkward, right? Not at all. So shall we meet? Another photo will be published tomorrow. May I come in, sir? Sir, actually the traffic in the DCP... Stop your excuses. Okay, sir. My newspaper is not interested in your DCP. Not, what? It's the four C's that are important. People enjoy them the most. I hope you remember. Sir, I told you about this C last time. And you had lost your temper. Do you want me to say it again? -Stop. Not that C. -No! The four C's are important in journalism. -Put it in your head. -Yes, I already have. -What are they? -You tell me. Comedy. And... celebrity. Bring some news about this RJ. Then we'll have an interesting story, a story that no one else except Padkar will have. It's yours. What? A challenge. I see. -I make the rules and decisions. -Decisions. Sir, please take this. Put that down. Put it down. Give me this one. This one. This one. And this one. I have to change my Facebook status from single to committed. I am not getting married, but I'm going to propose. Then buy the red roses. They're very common. I want to do something different, something special. -Really? -Yes. Then do this. Buy jasmine. Stop telling me and just give me a bouquet. You're Swati, right? I wanted to ask you something. Tell me. I knew you wanted to say something that day. Actually, my boyfriend is going to propose me today. God, listen. I prayed for your blessing for me to pass the tenth grade, but you didn't help me. I prayed for your blessing for me to be admitted to Xavier, but you didn't even help me a little. This time, please bless me with a happy life with Swati. What I feel for Swati is something that I've never felt for anyone else. It's from inside... Yes! He's here! He felt the same for those 23 ex-girlfriends. -Exactly. -Hey. I don't have time for all of you. Hey, we are also coming. I am not going to a party. So please, don't interfere. I am going to propose her. Sagar, please allow us. We will watch from afar. How could we miss the historic moment when a girl would say yes? But you won't come. No way. None of you will come. Get out. Come on. -Hey, Sagar, please. Please. -Sagar, please! Oh, no! Is she bailing on us? It's been nearly half an hour. She will come. Keep quiet. She's like the police in Hindi movies. She will definitely be late. Quiet. She's here. Yes, she's here. That's great! -Near the seashore -Both of them are matching. -They're both wearing black. -Yes. I object. -He has never offered us a seat. -Please keep quiet. Just watch. Hey, she stood up. She threw down the flowers. The 24th girlfriend has also left. What now? Let me say something. -I won't encourage you. -Never mind. He started as a romantic hero. But now he became a comedian. He lost his love on Valentine's Day. It's too bad. Yes, Mom. It's 10:00 p.m. When are you coming home? It's 9:30 p.m. I might come home late. Please, go ahead and eat dinner. No, it's Valentine's Day. I will wait for you. How long will you wait, Mom? Until you get your life partner. Listen. Make some porridge for me. I have an upset stomach. Why don't you care about your stomach? Stop eating too much of those fried snacks every day. And then everything will be normal. The starting tomorrow, I won't. I promise. Now, please make porridge for me. -And listen. -What? Drink some medicine for your digestion before going to bed. I can tolerate your snoring, but not the other things. What's this? Why didn't Sagar come and pick me up? I waited in school for an hour, so I went home on my own. He is not even answering my calls. Sagar didn't pick you up? Do you know where he went? Why didn't you pick me up? Is there a problem between you and Swati? Don't look at me like that. Every time you've quietly locked yourself in your room, it's always because of a girl. What happened? Forget it, Dad. I don't want to talk about this. All right. I will talk to Swati. We broke up. Swati broke up with me. Now, please don't ask me anything. All right. I won't ask. But can I say something? Kavita and I were from the same college. This was before I met your mom. We were in love with each other. We had decided to get married. But her dad was against it. He said he would drink poison if she goes for inter-caste marriage. She never met me after that. At that point, I thought that I would never be able to love anyone in life. And then I met your mom. And I never realized that we fell in love. With every heartbreak, someone will enter your life to love you again. Remember that. And yes, I want to stay on your mom's good side, so don't tell her about all of this. She doesn't know. But she might ask you someday. She already asked me. She still asks me today. Do you like Kavita? And I tell her that I still like it. What? I like poetry composed by Gulzar. I think we should organize a prayer for peace. Why? For all those whose love life ended, with your counseling yesterday. Krishna. When one falls in love, they never consult with me. They consult with me when they want to break up. But we can reason with them. People usually consult with people who say exactly what they want to hear. We don't consult to be reasoned with. I see. Sagar, look at my Pokémon shirt. It's Pikachu. Be careful. Someone might pull on your shirt in an attempt to catch pokémon. -What are you saying? Go away. -Yes, if they want Pikachu. Tell me. -Sagar. -Yes. -Did you get that? -It's Mehul. What? The audio. It is viral on WhatsApp. The reason of your breakup. It became viral, Sagar. Please be specific. What are you saying? Swati's audio recording with RJ Antra. Are you there? Send it to me. Send it to me now. What happened? -What happened? -Sagar, what happened? Look, Swati, you're in control of your own life. All decisions related to it should be yours to make. But I am ready to wait. It's useless, Sagar. Close your eyes and ask yourself what you want. This is viral on Facebook as well. I don't want anyone to get hurt. Swati, if you're not sure, then you will get hurt and you will hurt others as well. We will only hurt each other if we are together. Antra, what would you do if you were in my place? I would refuse. I would break up with him. It's not so easy. It will be difficult later on, Swati. It's your choice, but my advice is to break up with him. Swati. Do you know what you're doing? Do you? Yes. I have to meet this Antra now. I am coming to pick you up. Are you always so stubborn? Come on. I'm not being stubborn. I can even pick you up. You! I see. You will feel ashamed, won't you? It's the male ego, right? It's nothing like that. Are you nervous? Fasten your seatbelt. I hope you brought your license. Yes, I do. Do you need it? No, the traffic enforcers might need to see it. What? Because I don't have my license with me today. No, it's okay. I drive every day. I don't know why the brakes aren't working properly today. I got it checked yesterday, I don't know why. Yes. I got it checked yesterday. This is very risky. Slow down. Use the clutch. And pull over to the left. You can leave. He will take my order. What's the special? Yes. And I know his order. I think you also sleep in a suit, right? Actually, I never sleep. Once the US clients wake up, I start getting calls and e-mails. Wow, do you play the piano? No, I've just bought one. I will learn it when I have the time. I'll learn it in five years and play in a concert in ten years. Should you plan for doing something you like? Trust me, it works. With planning, life is easy. With planning, you can do projects. You can't live your life. So how should we live life? Like the radio. The next song that will play on the radio is always a surprise, right? Similarly, the next minute of your life should be a surprise for you. There's no fun in living with planning. But, I mean... A girl and a boy can never be friends. This Bollywood trope is fixed in our minds and is the main reason for all the confusion. Boys are often confused between love and friendship. If a girl wants to befriend a boy, she's in love. But now they are even confused between love and a cup of coffee. Please explain to them that going out for coffee isn't the same as saying yes to marriage. Aditya. Since when did you start listening to the radio? It just happened. The cook gave it to me. It plays in the background, you see. You didn't even ask for the newspaper today. Because I read it in my room. Actually, I'm getting late. Tell Dad to come home straight, all right? -Remember one thing. -What? Going out for coffee isn't the same as saying yes to marriage. That... Here. Cold drinks for this party. Mehul, what about you? Give me a small glass. Did I call you over just to enjoy the cold drinks? Hey, you. Put that down. -Let's do something extreme! -Then go and jump. Look. You know about Romeo and Juliet. -Yes, -And Bajirao and Mastani, right? The heroine will be impressed when she sees the hero's action. -Right? -Absolutely. Hey, RJ Antra is not my heroine. RJ Antra is my enemy, so please. Just listen. This guy will whistle at Antra. Okay. Then you will come and beat him up, okay? Then she will fall in love with you. Idiot. Look at this. Look. A celebrity will always fall in love with another celebrity. Look at him. Our Katappa. Does he match with her? Look at his T-shirt and jeans. Do they match? So how will he match with her? Wow, it's a very nice photo. Hey. Sagar and Antra. We will take a photo of them together and publish it. Really? You idiot. Hey, this is my house. Okay, go ahead. My boss is already mad for this RJ Antra. He wants news about her in his newspaper. What if we take your photograph with Antra and publish it? We'll call it an affair. But what am I supposed to tell her? That I'm her fan and I want to take a selfie with her? What nonsense. Think of something else, you idiot. No, I didn't mean that. Listen. We'll take a photo of you and her. And you'll look like a celebrity couple. It's fake news. We will publish the news. "RJ Antra's Second Affair." She will be ruined. Great. Yes, tell me. What were you saying? I didn't know that you go on coffee dates, Antra. Just a minute. It was not a date, okay. Actually, I had come to talk about another date. I'm going to have a small party on the day after tomorrow. A party without reason, right? It's my mom and dad's 35th anniversary. Oh, but I am so sorry. We'll keep each other company. -You are invited, too. -Yes, sure. But actually... Did he just order me? Bhura. You didn't serve us tea. He's acting like nothing is wrong. He couldn't take a single photo. Not a single one. Take your breakfast later. Be a good photographer first. Are you a crime reporter? I don't think so. You can't even take wedding photos. -Throw away this breakfast. -Keep quiet. Enough! Keep quiet. Sagar, your photos will be taken. Your photos will be taken. I will take them. Photos of you and Antra will be taken. I promise. It's a promise. But I won't compromise my breakfast. Oh, no. He wasted the bread. -Get me another plate. -He has wasted it. "Do waves ever ask the sand? 'Would you like to get wet?' So you can't fall in love by asking permission." That's great! "So, you can't fall in love by asking for permission." Amazing! Yes? -Yes. -Dad. That's it. -How are you? -Bless you. Bye, son. Isn't she RJ Antra? How did Aditya meet her? When I was younger, I used to attend events like these with a Walkman to avoid the fake gossip of fake people. When I was younger, my mom would force me to go to these parties. "Adi, sing that song. Adi, do that dance." I don't know if people had noticed your performance at that time or not. But right now, almost everyone is watching you. It's nothing like that. I'm going, now. Let's have dinner. I have a morning show. It's already very late. But I don't want to give you the wrong idea. So I hope you understand. -What? -We are... You're not giving me the wrong idea, all right? Because I know, that going out for coffee isn't the same as saying yes to marriage. Who is this from? You can't buy cassettes anymore. So what do I do with this Walkman? Did you ever think of why it is called Walkman? But how do I convert this walk-woman into a talk-woman? How do I get the cassettes? You will have to manage that. Shall we meet tomorrow? Sorry. I am going on a trip. But we will definitely meet after I return. Where are you going? Ask Google. Hey. I have breaking news. Let's go to the washroom. No. Stop moving too much. I have breaking news. So what are you waiting for? Come on, tell me quickly. -RJ Antra... -Yes. She's going on a trip. It's confirmed! So what are we going to do? We will follow her. No one will interfere. You, her, and my camera. Where is she going? Tell me. I don't know where. You idiot. You might as well take photos of the dead. You can't remember anything. Get lost. -Hey. -What happened? -What... -Stand straight. Give me just one chance. One chance. And then you watch. I will get all the details. Give me just one chance. You just follow me. Do you see that man? Who? Who are you talking about? The one standing beside Antra. Yes. He's her colleague. Okay. He will definitely know about Antra's trip. There he is. What? I'll stay late in the office. Please eat your dinner. Yes, I will come home late. I am coming. Two? Seems like he's having an affair. He has two. And look at you. Follow him. Girls pull him in. But what about you? Why do you always tease me? Let's go now. Who's this? It's the courier. You ordered something online, madam. What's she doing? My shoes have come. -Give it to me. -Yes, it's here. Just a second. What are you doing? Darling. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing? We are couriers from the angel of death. You have one final call. -Very good. -Oh, no. -One from this angle. -Another from this direction. Yes. Should we send these pictures to his wife on WhatsApp or upload them on Facebook? Hey, I don't know you. Why are you doing this? -You don't know? -No. You don't know me? Okay, let me add you on Facebook. Shall I send you a friend request? What are you doing, man? Just do as we say. What do you mean? One question. Just answer one question and we will leave. -Darling, who are they? -Just wait, baby. Wait a minute. Stop moving this swing. I am scared. Go ahead. Ask. Your RJ. What's her name? -Mantra. -No. Santra. Antra. Where is RJ Antra going? I don't know. Don't know? He doesn't know. Wait. What should be the caption on his photo? Let me think... Someone is caught red-handed. Too good. Also add this, "feeling unfaithful." And the hashtag, palpitation, you know? Then put a smiley face with shades. And then the grinning smiley face. I would have definitely told you if I knew. Please, delete my photos. Now your wife will delete you. You had danced like a serpent in your marriage, right? Now your wife will show you how a serpent will react. Just a minute. Darling, what are they talking about? Wife? No, darling. I will explain everything. Tell her later. Tell us first. Otherwise, we will start posting. Look, this will be on Facebook, on Twitter. Then on Snapchat, LinkedIn, Instagram, and you're gone. After two days, the 8:00 a.m. bus to Diu. Diu. Wow, what a location! Wow! It's my favorite place. Give me a high-five. Hey, Mehul. You will be with me. Get up, you idiot. Are you coming with me on vacation? What I mean is, you're going to follow me. Follow us and take photos, okay? I'll only take photos when she allows you to stand near her. Don't challenge me. Just don't challenge me. -Sagar. -Mom is coming. -Hey, close it. -Yes, mom. Packing? Where are you going? Mehul, didn't you tell her? Should you not tell her? Mom, actually, we are going to Diu for a few days. -We're also coming? -Keep quiet. I hope you're not going with Swati. Stay away from her. No, Mom. We all are going. Just for a change. To clear our minds. I wouldn't have refused if you had told me. You never say anything to me these days. You just keep quiet. Okay. Sorry, Mom. I will cancel the trip if you want. -Shall I cancel? -See, he's refusing. But all of you planned this, so you should go. Yes. But come and have lunch now. And what time will you leave in the morning? I will prepare some flatbread. Mom, what's this? Why do you make flatbread every now and then? Bring them back if you don't want to eat them. But you must take it. Remove a few T-shirts to make space for the flatbread. -Come on! -Put in extra flatbread, Mom. -Hey, fatty, get out of the car! Hurry up! -Get out of the car! Hey, Mehul! I have the luggage! Hey, go for it. Take good photos! -Make sure to secure the luggage, okay? -Okay. Hail, Lord Krishna. Where? There is. Exchange with that woman. How? Shall I go and sit on her lap? Idiot, sit quietly. Don't irritate me. How do I tell her to get up? Do something or else you'll play around until we get to Diu. We working women have to manage so many things. Home, family, office. No one understands. Frankly speaking, we do have cooks and servants at home. Still, we have to manage everything. We can't leave the house to the men. -Excuse me, ma'am. -Yes? Yes? May I say something? Because I cannot stop myself from saying this. Yes, what is it? You're exactly like my friend's mom. -Really? -Yes. -We call her a superwoman. -I see. Multi-talented. She can manage everything. Oh, that's so sweet of you, son. Good. At least someone recognizes my work. Yes. Do you have a plastic bag? Plastic bag? No. But what's the problem? Tell me. Ma'am, I have motion sickness. -I see. -If I'm not by the window, I feel like... Sometimes it happens. It's all right, son. Don't worry. I'm sitting by the window. Let's do this. Let's exchange our seats. Okay? -Really, ma'am? -Yes, son. It's not a big deal. You're too much. What a relief! Okay. Usually, I book a window seat. But this time, I did not. Usually, I book both the seats, so that no one sits next to me. It's just that I didn't book this time. Yes. Hello. Yes, mom. Yes, I am in the bus. Yes, sitting by the window. I don't want to eat your flatbread. Will anyone start eating as soon as the journey starts? Why do you ask constantly? We just started on the road. Yes, I will eat them later. Is flatbread something so precious? Keep quiet. Don't call me again. I will inform you as soon as I arrive. Yes, bye. Okay, mom. Don't talk to only your mom. Hey. I didn't tell you my name, did I? Because I didn't ask. You might have thought that if you ask me my name, it might give me a wrong signal, right? So let me introduce myself. I have a boyfriend and he says that I am a terrorist. If you had a boyfriend, he would have sent you a lot of messages and called you by now. And in reply, you would have sent him... many selfies with a pouting face. Don't worry. Since you've started the topic, let me tell you. If she speaks to little, then how will it be when we reach Diu? It will be difficult. Go away. Just sit there and take photos. Okay? Because there was no other vacant table. Don't give me that look. Chill. Okay? Don't you have to call your mom? Flatbread? -It's very tasty. -Who will eat my fried chapati? Take this homemade flatbread and keep your fried chapati. This is the signature dish of the Gujarati family. It's sure to be in everyone's bag while traveling. It's not in my bag. Doesn't your mom pack flatbread for you? Don't ask about my mom. She would rather unpack my clothes to make space for the flatbread. But I have a rule. Mom is like a villain. You must keep her happy. Hi, this is Love Line and you're listening to Ruchi. I know, Antra is not there. I wish you to be mine My heart has many hopes Will this dream ever come true? From the falling stars I ask you in my life Will this dream ever come true? It's magic, let me be under its effect Let me express My love for you today You happen to come across You happen to smile You happen to call me often I happen to see you And hear you everywhere And understand you all the time Yes, Mom. What is it? Yes. I already ate the flatbread. You kept asking me if I ate flatbread or not! Okay. I want you to do something. It's very important, so do it carefully. Call me later tonight. Okay? I'm still on the way. I'll call you when I get there. Okay? Bye. Hang up now. Wow, Deepu. While God was busy making people, he must have thought of creating a unique one. And that one must be Deepu. She's flawless. Drink some water. Do you need some medicine? "I think she's okay, honestly." Are you so in love with Deepika? You must be a fan. I am not just her fan. I am in love with her. What do you mean? Do you mean to say that you have never experienced one-sided love before? What nonsense? Shah Rukh Khan? Ranbeer Singh? Fawad Khan is the new hero. There must be someone from Bollywood. I mean, not exactly love. But Jagjeet Singh. I like him. I get a sort of feeling from his voice. It's like a special connection. And the rest... Like the ghazals? What about your other experiences? Did you have many breakups in life? I did not, but I've made many breakups. Listen, darling. You didn't tell me your name, so naturally... Antra. Sagar. Imagine if our wedding invitation is printed. It will be stylish. It will have flowers. Just imagine it. Ours? The imagination can go anywhere. Where do you work? I'm a radio host. So you're RJ Antra? I am sitting next to RJ Antra. I thought so. What did you think? You're a celebrity. That's why you're not smiling so much. Can we share? -What? -Can we share the earphones? Don't speak incorrect English. You can talk in Gujarati. It's okay. There's still two hours before we reach Diu. It's such a sad playlist. -Give it back. -I mean it's good. It's not bad. This is also a feeling, right? Call Mika Singh. Wait. I mean, even Arijit Singh is good. They both have the surname Singh. Hey, you got it? -Yes. -What? She's in the next hotel. I see. Sir. A double bedroom for both of you, okay? Yes. Sir, shall I upgrade you both to our honeymoon suite? Mister. What do you mean? We both are straight. -I am also straight. -Yes, you are. I know. But sir, we don't have a room with twin beds available. Only rooms with a double bed are available. Is that okay? Mehul. Mehul. What's it? You go if you want to. You have to woo her. Not me. Then who will take the photos? Mr. Pradyuman? -Who's he? -Your dad. -Hey, don't use my dad's name. -Exactly. I am leaving. I have the key to this room. Once you get up, come out and take the photos. Quickly. Bye. Yes. Are you following me? No, I was following my workout. At 11:30 a.m.? You didn't have breakfast, right? Why? Just say yes or no. No. That's why. You'll feel irritated when you have an empty stomach. I mean, I am going to have breakfast. Would you like to have some snacks? Actually, I always take the deal with complimentary breakfast. -But today, you know what? -Yes. And here's your breakfast. Don't you have flatbread? Yes, I have it. It is in my room. You're a smart girl. Is the flatbread an excuse to come to my room? What's your hobby? Is that question from the manual for arranged marriages? And sometimes I write. Where? On Facebook? For myself. I mean, not for myself. But sometimes you feel that you want to say something, but not to anyone. Only girls feel like that. Boys always speak whatever comes to mind. Just a minute. Why do you always differentiate between girls and boys? Boys are always very simple. If a girl passes by, he has to stare at her. If they see a big stone on the road, they will kick it like a football. And the moment they get injured, they will use foul language. The point is, boys will never understand girls. Girls are a total mystery. They have to have best friends. So then, the BFFs will be the problem. Many times the best friends become the big problem. So what will they do? They will not share their problem with their best friend. They'll share it with a friend, so the best friend feels bad. And the other friend thinks, "Yes, I am the best friend." The actual problem will be pushed aside and it will create a new problem. So who's your best friend? It's like, you don't know whether to grow your hair out or keep it short, whether to wear heels or flats, or which filter to use on Instagram. When you push these problems aside, you would have made a new problem. Applying a different color of nail polish on one nail and the other. Once. Losing track of Dawood's location makes sense, but applying a different color of nail polish on your third finger doesn't make sense. Do you that boys aren't confusing? Not at all. They don't know whether to send the friend request or not. If a girl asks you to get coffee with her, you don't know if she's going to be your friend or your girlfriend. "I will look like a kid in a clean shave. But with a beard, I'll look unruly." If I remove my T-shirt, I'll look like Anil Kapoor. If I get a wax, I'll look like Sonam Kapoor. What do I do? And you boys are not just confused, you're a little slow too. For example, sitting here and talking to you, I know that a few boys sitting there are watching me. But you didn't realize it. You won. Pay the bill. -Hey, mister. -I said, you won. Catch. Look there. The hashtag "couple." They came to Diu. You're strange. Wouldn't they take some photos? I take photos, but I don't put hashtags and show it off to others. I take photos for myself. In love, people... But how blind? Look, that girl will post her photo on Instagram. And her "best husband ever" will comment, "Love you too, baby." Idiot, you're on a honeymoon. Stop using your phone. Hey, you got a call. I am not on a honeymoon. I need you right now, but you're not here. Why? What happened? There's a traffic jam and no one is here to clear it. My mom isn't the only one who calls me. Shall we go? Are you going to drop me off at my room? No, actually... Yes. What? Actually, it's too dark. Yes, so? And there are many dogs. So? I am afraid of going alone. You mean, I should drop you off? No, if you don't mind. I can even tell the guard. And he will accompany me. That's it. Nothing wrong. You're so cowardly. If you're scared of dogs, what will happen to you in adventure sports, tomorrow? I am not afraid. I'm just afraid of dogs. And I'm afraid of cockroaches the most. Otherwise, I enjoy adventure sports. Please, accompany me now. Let's go, you coward. Let's go. Oh, a cockroach! -Mehul. -Yes. Have you come here to enjoy spending your company's money? Show me the photographs. Show me. Idiot. Show me. Give it to me. You just continue eating. I see. Whose photographs have you taken? You haven't taken a single photo of ours. Whose photographs are these? You're just saying sorry? If you won't take my photos tomorrow, I will send you back. And listen to me, I have a plan for tomorrow. Come now. Oh, gosh! I tripped! You don't want me to drop you off today? No, no need. I've befriended the guard who has befriended the dogs. They won't come near me when the guard is there. -And what's your plan for tomorrow? -What do you mean? We are on a holiday. We don't need plans. Photos are already being taken. -What? -I mean, you're already taking the photos. Don't you take photos of the sunset? -Not that. -Then? What's that? You'll see tomorrow, at 11:00 a.m. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Hey. No, she is going to eat flatbread today. I've already packed some. So if the class extends, we don't have to worry. Let's go. Let's go. Will you go to Pakistan like that? Okay, take a five-minute break from time to time. You get tired very quickly. What do you mean? I am an engineer, not a soldier. And by the way, in engineering class, we work harder than this. Okay, like? Like in a batch of a hundred, there are only ten girls, five of which are very studious. But we work so hard for the rest of the five. You won't understand. So did you impress any of the girls that way? You're asking me in a subtle way. Are you asking me in a subtle way if I have a girlfriend or not? In fact, I am asking you directly. Did anyone show interest in you that way? -Hey, I was in demand, you know. -Okay. It's a different thing when Punjabis took over the market. Those people who drink lassi. Looking at you, it doesn't seem like you've ever had a girlfriend. It's like you're window shopping. Yes, I mean the story never goes ahead. It just lets you watch. I see. You seem to be interested in my story. Tell me about yourself. You have a boyfriend or boyfriends? You seem like a don, you know. I see. Can you tell me why? Your boyfriend is with you all the time. "Yes, ma'am. Okay, ma'am. Yes, boss. Okay, boss." Rather than being a girlfriend, I would love to be a don. You have so much attitude. It's not that. But I find all of this fake. Relations are formed and changed as you need them. There's nothing like love or unconditional love. What do you mean to say? You haven't liked anyone yet? I've liked a lot of people. That notion of love is hard to believe. Let's go. The love hidden in my eyes Reflects in my talks with you It doesn't listen Despite having thousands of dreams I'm stuck dreaming about you I'm enamored As if you're a kite and I'm your thread You're taking me somewhere very far As if you're a kite and I'm your thread You're taking me somewhere very far Even after losing once I've placed a bet again Such foolish this gambler heart is I've become crazy for you I've become crazy For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you For you As if you're a kite and I'm your thread You're taking me somewhere very far As if you're a kite and I'm your thread You're taking me somewhere very far Even after losing once I've placed a bet again Such foolish this gambler heart is I've become crazy for you I've become crazy For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you For you What are you writing? I've become crazy for you -Show me. -Go away. I've become crazy for you You made me walk so much. I am so tired. Is there a spa in your hotel? You want to go to a spa? Come with me. I will make you experience the world's best spa. It was too good to be true. Have you worked in a spa before? Talking is a part of my job. You speak like the people from the TV shopping channels. "Hi, my name is Ms. Lolo. Earlier, I was very upset. Boys would run away from me. Then this product came into my life. Magic shoes. It has changed my world. Now, I run behind them with this." Will you drink some beer? A girl is asking you to drink, right? No, this a confused look. Even after I became an engineer... I don't drink. You mean never even occasionally? Not even occasionally. Come. It is good. You played well, although it was your first time. Let's play a game. You must answer every question truthfully. Yes, but what will we do for dares here? Truth or shot? What's that? Where did you get all of these from? I will speak nothing but the truth. Where did she get it from? -Come on. -Yes. Something about you that no one knows. I will tell you. But you won't tell anyone. When I was very small, my mom made me wear a girl's dress. And she also had some photos taken. And there's one more secret. You must not tell this to anyone. When I was small... I used to... stammer a lot. I stammered too much. But my parents are very loving ones. They didn't stop trying until I learned how to speak properly. They relaxed only after I started talking normally. Okay, tell me. When did you kiss someone for the first time? Just 15? I used to enjoy popsicles at that age. So are you still on the waiting list or have you got your number? What's your intention, ma'am? Do you want to open an account? My turn. Did you ever pee in the swimming pool... Anyone would do it in a swimming pool. Especially children. I hope you didn't do it after the banana boat ride. Are you done? Now, tell me. What is the biggest secret of RJ Antra's life? I told my mom to divorce my dad. Two people live together only because of social pressure. And in our case, it was me. If I wasn't in their life, Mom would have already divorced Dad. She needed the courage to take that step. And I gave it. With whom do you live now? With your mom or with your dad? I... I live alone. Don't you talk to your mom or dad on the phone? But that does happen. You see these loving people living together. All that looks good from the distance. But if you look closer, you will start to see the problems. But you... Your turn is over. Now, it is my turn. How many did you like until now? Twenty-four. -Twenty-four relationships? -What relationship? Eighteen and a half didn't even know that I was in a one-sided love with them. It's like I've graduated from love. It's very simple, Antra. When you like someone, you start liking everything. Here, drink some water. Finally, you gave up. What? Yes, just a minute. Always speaking incorrect English. Your mom never calls you up? My mom always calls me. She's like a villain that way. Your mom never calls, but my mom always does. Come. I am okay. Do you think I am not fine? -No, it's nothing -It's my rule. Drink, but set a limit. -This much. -Have you ever drunk before? -It's the first time, so... -I see. -Otherwise, I'm okay. -Come here. This way. I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I'll never drink again. It's 10:00 a.m. I have to checkout at 11:00 a.m. -Are you leaving? -Yes. What's your plan? Nothing. After two days, I'll return to Ahmedabad. So I guess now we will meet in Ahmedabad. Listen. Will RJ Antra give me her personal number? She'll give it to you. Shall I drop you off? No, that's okay. I don't like being dropped off or picked up. Oh, look who's here. My hero. You've done wonders. You didn't return the entire night. You must share all the details with me. Did you do anything special? We only planned to take the photographs. But you've done more than that. The entire night? I kept searching for myself But always found you With a heart full of emotions You're the companion of a long run You're the meaning of my poetry You're the closure of the incomplete story This is the sweetest punishment Even the pain is enjoyed Come, my beloved When you like someone, you start liking everything. Come, my beloved Come, my beloved It has all started With the meaning of love Come, my beloved -Come, my beloved -Please come to me -Listen to me. -Pack up, we are returning tonight. -Pack up. -Please come to me What affinity is this Between the hearts? Come, my beloved You should go on such trips three to four times a year. It's for your own good. Go away. You look very happy. Do you want to say something? Will I only know from the radio that you're back? Well, I am really sorry. I came back yesterday evening. I was going to call you, but... Don't just call me, we have to meet. -I want to speak to you very urgently. -Yes. Tell me. At what time? At four o'clock. It was the traffic. It wasn't my fault. You look so fresh. That's the magic of world's best spa. Aditya, the activities were really fun. You must really try if you haven't yet. Like parasailing, you'll feel like you're Superman. I've decided that I will always go on a holiday at a beach. Trust me. It was so amazing. I called you here to talk about something. I kept on talking. Now please, tell me. Mom is looking for someone to marry me. I met one recently. Wow. And then? Did you tell her? -You can sit while I bring the tea. -It's not funny. I just met Sanjana. But we hardly met after we grew up. But if you meet her a couple of times, you will know if you really feel like meeting her again or not, and if you really wish to know her more or not. When you are together, you forget about your phone. And when you are not together, you think about her only. If that's going to happen, then the arranged marriage can be a marriage out of love. I thought you were against love. You became like a love guru. Come, beloved Come It has all started With the meaning of love Come, my beloved Hey, Mr. Coward. When you can type the message, why don't you send it? Is this a truth or dare? Come, beloved Come It has all started With the meaning of love It has all started With the meaning of love Come, my beloved Can you call someone to meet you in the supermarket? So what? We can talk as well as shop for groceries. Yes, that's really strange. My mom also said the same thing. Enough, it is the end of the shop. This is enough. Don't you have brown bread? Brown bread? Why so? Is there racism in bread, too? What? Perfect. Enough. Enough, you will be like me if you eat too much Maggi noodles. She's going to open up a noodle shop. Hey, even I love rasgulla. Then what do you actually love? Pudding. Semolina pudding or... Cooked by my mom. I've become crazy for you For you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you Your silly talks I get anxious to hear you I enjoy all your talks I get anxious to hear you I enjoy all your talks Even after losing once I've placed a bet again Such foolish this gambler heart is I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you Hey, sir. You know what? After so many calls, even a god would come down to meet his devotee. At least answer my calls. Stop your jokes. I have great news. My boss has decided to publish your and RJ Antra's so-called affair in next week's issue. Mehul. Not so fast. There's no need to hurry up. -I will keep the pen drive with me. -Why do you want to wait? I've already submitted the photos to my office. This is your copy. Let's just publish it. Show the entire city. -This RJ Antra. -Hey. It's nothing like RJ Antra. You will not publish these photos. Let me go. Why did he change so much? -Tell me. -Make some time tomorrow evening. Why? We have a surprise birthday party for my sister. And you're invited. -Actually... -Don't worry. Not many people are there. And frankly speaking, my sister knows that it is her surprise birthday party. Okay. I had ordered a chocolate-strawberry cake. That means just one cake. Not two cakes with two separate flavors. What do I do with the two cakes? Idiot, why don't you understand? Hurry up now. -Hey! Is the playlist ready? -What? Honey Singh's full volume. I drink four bottles of vodka per day Hey! Will you drink vodka in my sister's birthday party? I'll punch you really hard. Sagar, please come here. Yes. Please blow up the balloons. I hope we didn't forget sending the invitations. No. My friend is coming. Antra. Is she the one who likes pudding? Hey, fatty. Do it properly. Yes! Smile, please. Sagar! Come. What's she doing here? I have a beautiful surprise for you. Salman Khan. Sagar is here. Make way. Happy birthday, my dear sister. Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, dear Jhanvi -Happy birthday to you She's the best one so far. Quiet. She's my friend. Just a friend? I'm in tenth grade now. Hey, look here. -Come here. -Yes. Yes! Sagar. Listen. You have it, too. It's nice. Now what? Give it later and spare little for me. -Enough. -Hey, come on. Boys, let's go. Hey. What's with all the ego? Ego I can find it on my own. -It's next to my room. -Okay. -If I can't find it, I have Google Maps. -Come on, hurry up. Take our photo. You hail from which village, girl? You hail from which village, girl? I hail from Gondal Let's play now It's drizzling And the clouds are thundering It's drizzling And the clouds are thundering This heart is restless This heart is restless This heart is restless This heart is restless It's drizzling And the clouds are thundering It's drizzling And the clouds are thundering You hail from which village, girl? -Where are you going? Let's dance. -I come from the village Gondal You hail from which village, girl? You hail from which village, girl? You hail from which village, girl? Antra. Antra. Antra. Antra! If you want my photographs, tell me next time. Every moment in Diu was so special to me. Was it just a game for you? To be famous? Or was it to blackmail me? Why? Why? Swati and I got to know each other a year ago. When she called you, you told her to break up. And she did. Perhaps you won't even remember her name. It was also a game to you, right? But this moment... So this was the revenge. You've succeeded in your quest for revenge. What was her name? Swati, right? I seriously don't remember. But if Swati really trusted you, she would not have called me. Did you ever ask permission from anyone? Whether you should love Swati or not, or whether Swati should love you or not? She asked for it. If not me, someone else would have given it. You have no right to decide what happens in my life. What I should or should not do From now on, I don't even want to see your face. My heart is on fire It has lit up the entire city My heart yearns for your love The rest of the world Is insignificant to me Antra. What happened? Where are you? What are you talking about? Where are you at the moment? Everyone is selfish. Everyone. Antra, I am coming to you. I am not at home. And I won't even go home. Antra. I kept searching for myself But always found you With a heart full of emotions You're the companion Of a long run You're the meaning of my poetry Hi, Ahemdabad. This is Antra. Actually, I never had a good night. I worked all night and couldn't sleep. So I talked to myself. I contradicted myself. And I consoled myself as well. But let's forget about the anger, and let's bring smiles on your faces. Don't look at me like that. Please. It's no use asking what had happened. Right? Because you won't tell. That's why I had called you. Otherwise, it is my problem and I will deal with it. You might not solve a problem by sharing it, but sharing will definitely make you feel a little bit better. All of my problems are inside my heart. I wish our heart would come with a remote control. Can I ask which channel it is that you want to switch off? I'm getting a link, K. We give our feelings to someone's heart like we're depositing it in a bank, and when there's a problem, we accuse the person as guilty. Isn't this wrong, whether it is friendship or a relationship? Stop reading the newspaper and listen to Antra. Terms and conditions are always applied to everything. Such a famous RJ had come to our house. I just can't believe it. Aunt Ritu and Kiran had called me up. She said that Sagar had celebrity friends. She asked me if Sagar was going to marry her. Antra. I didn't bring my lunch box today. Shall we go out for lunch today? Sorry, K. I am not in the mood. Oh, I forgot. You're upset. So you will go home early. Lock yourself up in your room and cry, right? What? I want to eat pizza only. Nothing else. What are you doing here? Take this. She doesn't use it. Give that phone back to me. I'm not giving it away. Thank you. I am sorry. I was busy. Yes, Rupesh. Yes. Please continue. I have some work to do. Please. So how did you have the time to have lunch on a workday? Well, I just finished a meeting. Krishna called you, right? Don't compromise your work for me, for lunch, or make an extra effort. "I am poor, sad lady." Have you seen your eyes? You didn't sleep last night, did you? You cried a lot, right? This morning, I could tell that you were trying to sound fine on the radio. I know you enough to understand when you're fine and when you are not. And I think I have the right to know what happened. What do I say? What do I say? That I made a big mistake? That I broke my own rules? Everyone is selfish in this world. And me? My trip to Diu is over, but my emotional trip is still not over. Everyone is selfish. Everyone. And it's selfish of me to want to see you happy. Seriously. If someone is bothering you, then I will run after him like the hero of the movie Ghajini. Please have some. Every day and night Every now and then I talk With your thoughts Your lively eyes would reveal All the secrets Get the details about this man. Quickly. I feel myself lost all the time Come, beloved Come, beloved It has all started With the meaning of love Come, beloved Come, beloved Come and let your heart Be drenched in this rain Come, beloved It has all started With the meaning of love It has all started With the meaning of love Why does he keep calling me? I've reached the client. Okay. Shall I send you the photo? As proof? At least trust me. Yes, sir. What's the problem, sir? Exactly my question. What's the problem? What? Antra. I don't know what happened between you and Antra or what the matter was between you two. I don't even want to know. I only have one problem. I get hurt if Antra is hurt. Look, sir. It is our personal... Those who share personal relations can be part of the problem. Keep away from her. And forget her. I've already committed one mistake, sir. Now, I won't make another mistake of forgetting her. I have never had ice cream on the road like this. Actually, I'm experienced in business proposals only. So I will talk in that manner only. If I don't meet you or listen to you, my life feels empty. I get nervous. I want your partnership. I want to share every small joy in every season with you. I've prepared myself a lot for this. I know you had said that we are just friends. But I have a simple dream. You should be happy. That's it. Everything that you like, even if I don't like it, it will be part of my life forever. I have only one goal. After waking up in the morning, you should feel that this is the best day of your life. Just change your address. This is the lovesick fool. Don't worry. I didn't call you up to ask for permission. I mean, not yours. Then what are you calling for? Yes, it's my girlfriend. She ignores me. She doesn't speak to me. She doesn't reply to my phone calls. You must have given her a reason. I agree that I've made a mistake. But if she wouldn't talk, answer my calls or reply to my messages, how could I find a solution? You tell me. Not replying is also a reply. If you didn't get it, understand that message. Forget everything. Days, dates, roads, I can forget everything. But not her. Sorry, but we don't have much time, so... Just a minute. Will you please play this last message of mine for her? I mean... she will listen to me wherever she is. She's your biggest fan. The joy of listening to the songs through a single earphone. I really miss it. I also miss the joy of sharing flatbread. I look at life like how I look at software. I can't concentrate at anything without her. My boss tells me to do something and I do it. My boss tells me to do something and I do it. You know what I did? I kept washing my jeans with my mobile phone in the pocket. I tried to start my bike using my house key. In passwords, wallpapers, and conversations... Everywhere, it's you. It's just that you're not with me. I agree, it's my mistake. But will you not give me a second chance? I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you Is this because of Swati's phone call? Antra. I don't know what all happened at Diu. I don't know Sagar. But I've never seen you affected so much. I don't want to see you like this in the future. A life partner should be the one who would always make you feel happy and secure. According to me, Aditya is perfect for you. Aditya. What? What did you say? Nothing. But I am not in a right state of mind to make such a decision. I can give infinite reasons to give say yes to Aditya. But give me one reason to refuse him. You talk a lot on the radio. But ever since dinner, I've noticed that you're very quiet. -Why? -It's not that, ma'am. Actually, I like to listen to people too. Same here. Especially stories about you. Aditya talks a lot about you. I am sorry. Actually, things happened so suddenly, so I had to call Krishna. Really. Before meeting you, I didn't know the world outside of my laptop. Well, I wish we can eat dinner together every day. It's yes from my end. -Really? -Yes. If you want I will talk to Aditya about your proposal. If you won't say yes, I will. Really. A life partner should be the one who would always make you feel happy and secure. I have only one goal. After waking up in the morning, you should feel that this is the best day of your life. I want your partnership. I want to share every small joy in every season with you. Your silence Will express your love Nights spent sleepless will express Some things that are yet unspoken Let me remain besotted It's the state of mind Let it enjoy this state I happen to come across you I happen to smile I happen to call you often Mom. Tell me. Antra. I don't want to listen now. Hey. I happen to smile I happen to call you often Oh, my God! Without you, Shyam Where's Sagar? -Here he is. -What happened? Sagar, Antra is engaged. Ma'am, Mr. Sagar is here. He said he will not leave without meeting Antra. Sagar? Krishna. I'm Antra's boss. I want to speak to Antra only. How much more will you trouble her? I want to meet her once more. Please. She's going to start a new life. She was deeply hurt after so many years. If you really want to see her happy, then stay away from her. Noe one can make her happier more than I can. No one can hurt her more than you. She accepted this marriage proposal. She wasn't pressured by anyone. She doesn't wish to be with you. So stay away from her, please. FOR ANTRA Because you've been ignoring my phone calls and my messages, I thought of trying an old-fashioned letter. It will be delivered without my name so you can at least read it. I have nothing else to say, Antra. I just want to give you a dare. One last dare. Answer my three questions. Does he make you laugh the most? Do you think about me when you're with him? Who do you remember when Arijit Singh's song is playing on the radio? It's okay if you don't tell me your answer to these questions. Just answer them to yourself. The box contains garlic bread with cheese. Both are made for each other. With right combination, life becomes tasty. I've become crazy for you I've become crazy for you Tell me. Which do you think is the best? All of them are beautiful but this one. You know what? This is my favorite color. That's it. You will perform the rituals while wearing this saree. Who would do it if not you? You always act like my mom, anyway. So you must do this too. No melodrama, please. I told you a lot of times to stop watching those soap operas, please. RJ ANTRA, WHO SOLVED THE PROBLEMS OF PEOPLE IN LOVE, IS IN LOVE -Sagar. -Yes. -Son. -Yes, I know. These days, WhatsApp is faster at showing news compared to the papers. But what happened all of a sudden? It was my mistake. I deserve this. Now, I just want to see her happy, with me or without me. Bye. Look at the time. -Why? -I have the morning show. Unlike you, I am not my own boss. Let me just change. Please be quick. Shall we go? I hope you're not taking this decision under any pressure. I mean, you're making this decision from your heart. Right? Is there anything bothering you? I mean, any tension? It's just that all of this is happening very quickly. This is a big change for me. If you want, we can postpone the date. No. There's no reason to postpone the date. Antra, don't forget that we are friends first. You can share anything with me. No, I don't know Why I am searching Your name In my henna pattern? What's with that look? Do you want to say something? Who? Aditya? Yes, tell me. There's a problem. What problem? -Those photographs of you and Antra. -Yes. My Boss wants to publish them tomorrow. On the day of Antra's marriage, there will be news about this. Mehul, come here. Sagar. Tell me. Antra is troubled enough because of me. -Yes. -But not now. Okay, but what to do. Do whatever you have to. But they must not be published. Tell me. Where is his office? Come. Every passing moment Is becoming heavier This heart wants to go Far away from this decoration Come, beloved Come and awaken desires Come, beloved Now can you still publish the photos? Completely? The system has crashed. A challenge. Over here, I have the final say and the final decisions. What were you doing? Playing a video game? Yes. Which one? A challenge. Mehul. Did you forget? I always carry a backup. I have the original photos here. Okay, now go away and do your job. Mehul, hold him. Hold him. Mehul. Attack him! The top turns round and round -Where are you running? -Catch him! -Hey! -The top turns round and round He's the minister's son. -Get him! -It turns round and round Your room is that way. Do you know? What? You know everything. What? I want to meet Antra. Right now. Wait for a while, and then you'll have your whole life together. I'm worried about our life together. Right now. Both of you are going to be married to each other soon. -The guests are here. -That's what I'm saying. Krishna, I want to say something to you. And I want to hear something from you. -Aditya. -Just a minute. You can answer people without meeting them or without even seeing them. You can read everyone's mind. But not your own? Antra, will you play a game with me too? Truth or dare? Antra, when you wake up and when you go to sleep, whose face do you wish to see? I just want to see you happy. It doesn't matter if you're happy with someone else. Actually, you will not be comfortable in those heels. These will be more comfortable. Give me the key. Where do you want to go? Why won't he pick up the phone? Do you have his home number? Oh, right. Hello. Is Sagar there? He isn't receiving my calls. He isn't receiving my calls as well. Just a minute. Antra, you were supposed to get married today, right? Yes, but it's a long story. I will tell you when we meet. Tell Ahmedabad to find him. RJ Antra escaped with the famous businessman and her fiancé, Aditya, before their marriage. Antra! -Krishna. -Yes, Vishal. What? Yes, she's on-air. She came in here wearing her wedding dress. I have to listen to the radio. This is Antra on Love Line. I know I've come at the wrong time. But that's the point. It's not that the timing is wrong, it's the situation. And me? Being the victim of the situation, and without asking the priest, I've come here in my wedding dress to find my real groom with my best friend Every time you faced a problem in your love life, you people have called me. But today, I need you. Will you help me, Ahmedabad, to look for him? What does your groom look like? He's a strange one, a unique one. God must have thought that he made so many normal people, that he should make a strange and unique one. That's why God must have created him. It will be difficult to find him from that description. Okay. His height is around 5'10". And his body... you can say that he's healthy. He keeps fixing his hair and biting his nails. He rides a bike. And jokes, he likes telling jokes. If you tell more than one joke, you feel like laughing in the way that he's laughing. If you find any clues, then please, Ahmedabad, please call me immediately. Aunt, has Sagar come home? No, not yet. Aunt, turn the radio on. Antra is on-air. Okay. Hello, Antra. I can see someone with that description. Okay, can you describe him? He has oily hair and is sitting on his bike. -And? -And he is smoking. No. He doesn't smoke. He only drinks tea. Kettle tea. If anyone listening is near a tea vendor, then please look around. He must be around there. Antra. RJ Antra? Yes, I am RJ Antra. Tell me. Antra, I am your biggest fan. Only your station is played at my tea shop all day. Sir, thank you very much for listening to me every day. But right now, please help me find the one I am looking for. That's why I called you. One boy has been sitting here for the past three or four hours. His height and body match your description. He's wearing jeans. What else he is doing? This is the fifth cup of tea that he's having. And he's sitting very quietly. Is he shaking his legs? Yes. He is shaking his legs. And also biting nails. Sir, please let me hear his voice. How do I do this, my dear? Wait a minute. Let me try. Please, hold. Listen, shall I bring piping hot tea for you? Do you want bread-butter? Sir. Sir, listen. Ask him if he will eat flatbread. Listen, I make the best flatbread. You will never get to eat such tasty flatbread anywhere else. My mom's flatbread is the world's best. Make him stay there, sir. I am coming. Where are you at the moment? I am coming, sir. How much is the bill? Don't worry about the money. Take this. Drink this special tea I've made. And you will be all right. I don't want to drink your tea. Just tell me how much. Eight years have passed. In the evening, people line up to have tea at my stall. Yesterday, my wife complained about my tea. I mean, if somebody told the superstar actor that he can't deliver the lines, wouldn't he lose his temper? Wouldn't I lose my temper if someone complained about my tea? All right. Please, spare me. Let me go. Yes, but please have some tea first. Do it for me. Please drink this tea. I don't want to have your tea. I am done. Why is the media here? Have some tea for my sake. Quickly. I never insist people to drink my tea for the wrong reasons. And I don't allow others to do it either. Drink this. Drink it. -Take it. -Sagar! Come, beloved Memories have Started fading My world is completed With you in my life I came here to breakup with Sagar who has hurt me, and who has lied to me. I want to forget that Sagar. I want the Sagar who is like his mom's flatbread. He drinks tea, but he's like coffee. It's like he's part of my life. You can't even handle two pegs. Will you be able to handle me? I was very upset earlier. My 24 ex-girlfriends used to ignore me for an entire day. And then you came into my life. My life became colorful. Now, it will be colorful. Will you go on the scariest adventure of the world with me? I'm scared of adventures. Will you marry me? Let me ask my mom. Wait a minute. Where's my mobile? My mobile. Sagar. Allow me to take your photographs and then I'll give this back. Just a minute. Take my photo first. Take my selfie. Antra, I made your groom stay here. I forced him. He wanted to leave. Sir, if you take a photo with her, the headlines tomorrow will say that she ran away with the priest. Shut up. Don't laugh. -Mehul. -Yes. Take everyone's photos later. Take a photo of me and him first. I've been a longtime fan of his. -Do you remember my words? -Yes. If Antra is bothered... Then you will be bothered, I remember. I will call you anytime for coffee. But I will drive. And Antra's real adventure began now. Not an adventure of falling in love, but an adventure of flying in love. Now, she has two wings. If you believe that love is only about being with someone, then you will never understand the true meaning of it.
