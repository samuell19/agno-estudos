- So, to sum things up, know the story you want your customers to have from day one. The bigger the journey you take them on, the stronger your relationship will be with them. That way you are able to create a stronger brand and a stronger business. Thank you. If you have any questions, I'm here. I look forward to working together. Excuse me, one moment. Oh, hmm... Okay! Here you go. - Thank you. So, did you knock 'em dead? - I really did! Honestly, they're probably still lying there like a bunch of upturned June bugs! I'm glad. - But now I'm actually feeling guilty for feeling so good. - Ugh, sweetie. It's just the next step, learning to embrace and enjoy all your positives again. Exactly as Mike would have wanted you to. - I might actually give the group a skip tomorrow night. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. - Bereavement support isn't just for the bad times. I know the girls would appreciate hearing about how you knocked it out of the park today. - Thank you, but... I actually have a thing. - A date? - No, no. Um... No, it's... it's a wish. Something I've wanted for a really long time, and today, it might be coming true. Hi, I have an appointment today with Dr. Shaw. - The good news, the embryos you and your husband had frozen with us are in great shape. But I'm afraid your reproductive system is not. It's not in the state we need it to be for you to carry a baby to term or to give birth. I'm so sorry. - Dr. Shaw... my husband, he was... He was the love of my life. This baby is all that I have left of him... and the life that we were going to build together. Surely there's something we could do. A medical trial or... anything. - Nothing that would guarantee your health and well-being. - Well, I could sign a waiver, or... - There are other options, of course. There's adoption. - Um, no, thank you. - I want Michael with me. I want to know that we're having our child. - Well, there's always this. Surrogacy can be an excellent choice. And one that's worked well for many of our patients. We can set you up with a carefully screened match and make introductions. - You mean have someone else that's not me carry our child? I don't know that I could do that. - Of course, I respect whatever choice you make. And you don't have to decide today. But I wouldn't leave it too long. - You know... giving birth isn't the only thing that makes a mom any more than a marriage is defined by a wedding day. - Do you remember our wedding day? - Of course. It was beautiful. - Those are the only memories I have left of him. That's why every piece of physical evidence is... Well, it's so important to me. So precious. Especially this baby. I just need to know that it feels right. I can't go through losing him again. I really can't. - I know. - How you doing, nugget head? Thought I might find you here. Grace told me what they said. What a pair we are, huh? If Mom and Dad were still around, do you think they'd be disappointed neither of us have managed to give them grandkids yet? - No. No, I think they would completely understand. Miracle babies, right? That's what they called us. "You wait years for one baby to show up, and two arrive practically together!" - Honestly, I think Mom wanted us so badly that she willed us into being. - But we don't have to do that. We've got 21st-century medical science at our fingertips. Grace and I, we're doing IVF. And you have the surrogate option. I don't know what Grace has told you, but we've been trying for three years now, and we're really feeling the strain. I kinda wish we had some nice lady show up and just be like... - It's not as simple as that. - I know, I do know... I guess what I'm trying to say is you've got options. In a year's time, you could have your miracle baby. Just pick up the phone and say, "Yes, Dr. Shaw!" Not everyone has that chance. - That doesn't necessarily make it right for me. - Remember Mike's mantra? "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good." - The best candy bar in the world. Thanks. - You're welcome. It's not a baby, but it comes pretty close, right? Can I walk you back? - No. Thank you. There's actually somewhere I want to go. - Okay, sure. See you later, nugget head. - Here I am again, asking what you would do. What should I do? I know. I know what you would say. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Hi. Yeah, I would like to speak to Dr. Shaw, please. I need to make an appointment. Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - It doesn't look like Susie's meetings with potential surrogates went very well. - It's just bad news all around today, isn't it? It's even worse when you see it written down, isn't' it? Hey. - So... surrogates? No good? - Dr. Shaw, she pulled together a really lovely group of women. But... I don't know, it just seems so impersonal. - I said no to all of them. - Ah... I'm sorry. - Where is Andy anyway? - I mean, you should know by now timekeeping isn't his strong suit. Oh, wow. Speak of the devil. - Hey, everyone. - Hey, Andy. Um... Are you going to introduce us? - This is Lorna. Paul Morgan's sister. You remember Paul, from our street? They had that dog with the crooked tail 'cause it got hit by the ice cream truck, and Paul never wanted ice cream that whole summer? - Right, um... Lorna! You were just a little dot the last time I saw you. What brings you here? - I've just moved here. Paul said I should look you guys up, reconnect with some friendly, familiar faces. - Hope that's alright. We always over-order. - Um... Right, okay. Well, I will... I'll just put out another place setting. Come on in. - Thanks. - Go on in. - So, Lorna, um... Are you here for work, or studying, or... - Or a man? - Grace! - Or a woman! Because that would be fine. It'd be great, actually. - No. Nothing like that. I got a job working at the Law Help Centre over on Huron Avenue. It's just admin stuff, but I'm also studying part-time and saving to go travelling. - Oh, wow. Finding rent, and saving and paying for college? That... That can't be easy. - It's not. - Lorna needs a side hustle she can basically do in her sleep. - Am I missing something? - Suze? What do you think? About Lorna being your surrogate? - I really do want to help, Mrs. Ashcroft. - Oh, please. Uh, call me Susie. - People were very kind to me a few years ago when my mom got sick. And I remember how kind your mom was to me and Paul when we were growing up. - Are you going to say something? - If you could excuse me just for a minute. - Suze. - It'll be fine. Eat. - I am so sorry. I didn't know he was gonna do that. - It's okay. It's not your fault. - He means well, but he is not subtle. - No. - You know what? You stay here. I'm gonna talk to him, get him to take Lorna home. This was completely inappropriate. - No, wait. You heard her. I mean, she knew my mom, dad... Our street. Our family. Maybe... Maybe this is right. I mean, maybe she is the one that should carry my baby. I just said that, hey? My baby? Yeah. - Do you hate me? The baby thing... it's not really working out for me and Gracie right now. I just... I want to see it work out for you. Besides, I promised Mom I'd always look after you. - From candy bars to surrogates? - Whatever it takes. - Okay. I... I'll talk to her. - Yeah? Come here. - Lorna, I just... I wanted to check with you. Are you sure about this? I mean, you're very young, and well, nine months is a while, and it could cramp your style for a bit. - Oh, uh... I'm not into partying or anything like that, Mrs... Susie. I just want to get my degree and get on with my life. - Okay. I can't tell you how much this means to me. You'll be very well taken care of. And I can pay you a generous amount. I earn a good living, and I was left life insurance when my husband passed away. - Um, we can talk about all that later. - Okay, sure, right. Um... Thank you. - Um... Well, thanks for dinner. And I'll just get out of your hair. - Oh, no, you don't have to leave. I remembered, I actually have some photos of all of us when we were little kids in the garden. I can find them and show them to you, and we can sit and chat and get to know you better. Unless there's somewhere you need to be. - Oh, no. That sounds great. - Okay. I'll be right back. Sounds like we have a plan then. Okay. Hey, Andy, can you give Lorna a ride? It's getting really dark out there. - No, it's okay, I can walk. - Are you sure? It's really no trouble at all. - Honestly, I'm good. I get some of my best thinking done when I'm walking. - Okay. Night. - I can't find my damn keys... and there they are. - Andy, she's out there walking alone. It's dark out there. She's not gonna be able to do that when she's got the baby. - We're ready. - Good luck. - Well, that was flawless. Get some rest and let me know if you have any questions. - Thanks. - Okay, take care. - Hey. - That was so fast. Wow, how do you feel? - I feel good. A little uncomfortable, but good. I think I'm due for a cup of tea and a nice nap at home. - Oh. Um, did the nurse say that was okay? Did she give any notes or instructions? - Susie, it's all good. I'd never do anything to put the baby in harms' way. Promise. - Okay, but... - Look, communication is key. I swear that I will keep you in the know on everything to do with the baby. But you need to trust me for this to work or the next nine months will be a lot crazier than it needs to be. - You're right. You're right! It's a partnership. And partnerships require trust, honesty, and great communication. I... I promise I will do my best, but... the anticipation is going to kill me. Do you want a ride? - Sure. - Okay. - Are you sure we shouldn't have stayed a little longer? Just to make sure everything was okay. - They said it was fine. Besides, I feel good, and I'd rather be at home. Susie, we just talked about this. - Well, at least we both have a mama bear look sorted out. - If only that look worked on everyone. Oh, right here's fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Well, I'll see you when I see you. - Okay... Oh, boy... - Hi! Delivery for Mama Bear! - Come in. - Is this right? - Yeah, I think so. I mean, it looks great. - Then why do I still have this? - Hmm, good question. Oh. Ah, this is my work calling. I've gotta take this. - Okay. - Hey, yeah, Steve, it's me. Yeah, I'm sending over the amended files right now, Steve. Let me know if you get 'em, okay? So, this is the size that you are right now, huh, little baby? I hope you're okay away from Mummy. - Hey! Are you snacking and slacking right now? - Did you know that the little one is the size of an apple right now, according to this? - Aw... That's amazing. - It is weird... if I say that I miss my baby? - No, of course not! Hey, why don't you call Lorna up, invite her over? - Okay. She's not picking up. You think she's okay? I don't know, maybe I should go over there. - I'm sure she's just fine, Susie. She's probably napping. Pregnant on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I know I would be. - Right. - The nursery is not gonna decorate itself. - Perfect. Cheese! Aw. - Okay, great. This looks so great! Okay, I'm gonna get a photo of the crib, and I'm gonna send it to Lorna. Oh, wow. She responded right away. - What'd she say? - Oh, she says... "It looks fantastic. I can't wait to see it in person. And I'm stuck at home with a bit of a cold right now." - Oh. - I... I don't know. I feel like I should go over and see her. Do you mind? - No, no, not at all. Go be with both of them. I can finish up here. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Thanks, Grace. - Bye. Thanks for coming by. You really didn't need to. - Oh, no, no. I couldn't leave you here alone. All by yourself and you're feeling ill? - Oh, it's just a sniffle, it's nothing, really. I keep to myself mostly. My life is really low-key. I do feel like I'm carrying around a Faberge egg in here. - Do you mind? May I? - Um, sure. - I just think it's so neat that they can hear from the inside out. - I do find myself talking to her. - Do you? - Yeah. - I can't wait to tell her all about her dad. Any kicking so far? - Uh, not yet, but any day now, according to Dr. Google. - Okay, well, be sure to tell me as soon as it happens. - Of course. I'm looking forward to it, believe it or not. - I believe it. So how's your brother? How's Paul? - He's good. - Yeah? Is he working, or...? - Uh, this and that. He struggles to settle on one thing you know? - Yeah. Yeah, he was never one to concentrate. He went from one thing to the next. Totally. - Did you find, or do you have any photos of when you guys were kids? Or when we were all kids together? - Actually, I do. Um, they're just in the back room. I'll go grab them. Found them! Here they are. I knew I had them somewhere. - Aw! Oh, your mom. She's very... very sweet. And this is you. You're what, maybe...? - About five, I think? You know, I actually have a test on Monday, and I should really start studying. - Oh. Sure, yeah. - I just, I don't want to be up crazy late. - Of course. I should probably go. This has been really nice, to spend time with both of you. Goodbye, little one. I hope we can do it again sometime. - Sure. - No, don't get up. Um, I'll let myself out. Here. You need to sit down and properly relax. - I can move around. The baby's not gonna fall out. - Lorna, I wish you would consider staying with me. It just would feel so lovely to have her close by. And of course, I would help take care of you. - That's kind, but I want to keep my independence. - Right. Maybe we can discuss it again further down the line. - He looks really nice. - He was. I think he would approve of us. I mean, of this. - You're really lucky. I haven't had the best track record with men. - Oh? You know, I did kiss a lot of frogs before I met Mike, so I get it. But what about you? You've never...? - No. Not right now. Not for a little while. My last relationship was... - You know, you don't have to get into it. - No, I'm not ashamed. It wasn't me. It was him. David Michael Reese. Let's just say he wasn't a very nice person. And he loved motorbikes more than he loved me, or anyone else, for that matter. Eventually, I got up the courage to leave him. - He's not still around, right? - Oh, no, I doubt it. He's actually part of the reason I moved to the city. To get a fresh start. - Well that's good. Hi! - Sorry to just drop by out of the blue. - No, no, come in. - I went by that new mom and baby store on Myers Street. And I couldn't resist! - Oh! How adorable are these? Thank you. - Oh, I have one more thing for you, and I hope you don't think it's too much, but I could just picture it in the nursery. - Okay. - One sec. - Oh my goodness, he is adorable! She's really gonna love playing with this. Thank you. - I'm sorry, it's just... - Oh, no! No, sweetie, please. One day, this will be you. - I know. I know, and she'll have a cousin to play with. - Two cousins. Maybe three. - Oh! Okay, now, slow down there. - Do you want to come in for coffee? Lorna's in the living room. - Oh, no, no, it's okay. I actually have somewhere to be. - You sure? Yeah? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay, bye. - Today was really fun. - Yeah. Thanks for letting me get to know you better. - Thanks for the ride. - No problem. Goodbye, little one! Are you okay? That was close. Are you okay? - Honestly, I'm fine. - I think I should take you to a hospital. - No! No, Susie, please. I just want to go upstairs where I feel safe and can get comfortable. Please. - Okay, okay, let me at least help you upstairs. - Okay. - Oh, my God. Lorna, who did this? Ah, oh God! Oh God! - Sit down! Sit down! Just take a deep breath, please. Please, just... This is crazy, I'm phoning an ambulance. Hi, I... I need to get an ambulance right away, please. Just take a deep breath. Lorna. You should come home with me. - No. No, I'm fine. I promise. I'm sorry, this has all been such a fuss. - No, no! We need to know that you're both safe. Besides, your place is probably still crawling with cops. - Look... I appreciate your generosity, I do, it's just... I've been on my own for a while now, and I really like it that way. You know, feeling like I have it all together, my independence. I just really don't want to lose that. And your baby is my priority, sure, but I have to look after myself too, you know? - Listen... I hear you and I totally respect your privacy. But I can reassure you that you both will be safe at my place. Please? Please, just come with me. Both of you. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Everything's fine. I... I made you tea. I... I was gonna bring it up. - Thanks. Susie? What's going on? - I just, I... I thought I heard some racoons in the trash or something. I'm coming right in. Hello? Hi, Detective Mayhew. Uh, no. Lorna's not actually here right now. Um, this is... Yeah, no, this is her mom. You can talk to me. No, she's gonna stay with me for an unforeseeable timeline, so I know she's safe. Have you guys found anything, like any kind of suspect or... anything? What about the guy on the motorbike? What about the fact that someone tried to break into our windows later that same day? No, I don't have any concrete link between the two. Yes. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I do anything to help with dinner? - No, dinner's pretty much prepped. Lorna, there's not anyone that you would be on the wrong side of, is there? - No. - Someone you may have hurt their feelings? College or work, or anything? - There's no one. - I remember you saying that your ex, he really liked motorbikes. - Yeah, along with a lot of other guys on the planet. - Right. Dinner's almost ready. You can go wash up if you want. - 'Kay. - Ah-ha. Found you. - Hey, why don't you take five? I'll make you coffee for once. - No. I have so much work to do, and I just, I really want to finish tidying up. - No, I told you I'd help, okay? Let me tidy, and I'll make lunch too, okay? I just need to make a phone call first. What's this number? I'm just gonna see who called. - Don't. - What's the matter? - I might have answered your phone when you weren't here. It was the police, and I pretended to be your mother. - Why would you do that? - To save you a hassle. - From my own phone calls? From the police? What else are you keeping from me? - I'm not keeping anything, I swear. If you had just come home... - This isn't my home. - If you had just come back here... I was worried about my baby, and about you. The police have said that your place is fine to go back to, but I've decided that... - Susie! You don't get to make those decisions for me. - I get to make them for her. - No. This isn't care. This is coercive control, and it's not good for me or my baby. - Your baby? - I'm going upstairs. - Hey, uh, Grace. It's me. Uh, do you have time to meet up for coffee? Hey. - There you are. - Thanks. Oh! Excuse me. - Grace, what's...? What's going on? - We've come to the end of the road with the IVF. No baby. Hugely decreased chances of there ever being a baby. Just a whole bunch of enormous bills. Oh, please. Please don't be kind to me. I'll bawl my eyes out if you are. I've come to terms with it. I mean, we've done everything we can, and more. We're just so bruised and exhausted by all of it. - How's Andy taking all of this? - Well... The money the procedures cost and how it made me feel, it put a lot of strain on us. A lot of strain. Suze, that's what I wanted to tell you. Andy and I are... We're taking a break from each other. He's moved out. - Grace, I am so sorry. I had no idea. I've been so wrapped up with Lorna and the baby and my own life that... I haven't been there for you. I promise that that's gonna change from this moment forward. - Well, it would be nice to see more of you. And the baby. - Of course. - When she comes. - My gosh. You know, when you and Andy first got together I... I thought you were such a perfect match. That that's what I wanted in a relationship. And then when I met Mike... I thought to myself, well now I can have what Grace and Andy have. - Well... We are simply on different paths, sweetie. And that's okay. - Look at what I got you. This is the picture of our little girl. Right now she's the size of an apple, maybe bigger. I'm gonna tell her everything we did, everywhere we went, and everything we've achieved together. Especially her. Lorna! I'm back. Listen, I don't want to fight. Are you here? Lorna?! - Hi, this is Lorna. You know what to do at the bee. - Lorna, hi. It's me. I keep trying to get a hold of you, I just... Can you call me back and let me know that you're okay? Please? Lorna? Where are you? Has Ms. Morgan telephoned at all to say why she isn't here? - Sorry, we haven't heard from her. - Okay. - Hi, this is Lorna. You know what to do at the bee. - Lorna, hi, it's me, um... I'm really sorry that we fought. Can you please just call me or text me? Just let me know that you're okay, okay? Thanks. Andy? - Hey, sis. - Hey, um, what are you doing here? Where is everyone? - Well, after Mike passed, I let the admin staff go, the business contracted, and I got stuck with the lease. You alright? - No. Lorna's gone. - Gone? What do you mean? - We got into a fight and she left. I don't know where she went and she's not answering her phone. I haven't been able to find her. Do you have her brother Paul Morgan's phone number? - Slow down. When was this fight? - It happened earlier this morning. - This morning? She's probably sulking at a friend's. - No, it was like six hours ago. - Oh, Suze, you went AWOL for two days one summer and you were only 18. And Mom and Dad were having kittens. - Yeah, I wasn't pregnant, Andy. And... I saw footprints at the backdoor and then I found... her necklace. - Footprints? Don't you think you're getting a little afternoon murder mystery? - You think I'm overreacting? - A little, yeah. - So what, you think she's just... gone home? - Eating for two, binge-watching cable. You can't spend the rest of this pregnancy dialled up to an eleven, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack. You should just, um... try to enjoy it. - Grace told me everything. - That must have taken quite a while. - I'm so sorry. - I just gotta give her some time and hope she comes around. - From everything I've gathered from Grace, it seemed like you were the one that initiated the break. - To be honest, I could just see that her heart wasn't in it. In me, in us anymore, so I made it easier for her. Go home. Make your surrogate a nice, hot cup of cocoa with marshmallows and cream and chill the heck out. - Okay. Lorna? Lorna?! - Hi, this is Lorna. You know what to do at the bee. - Lorna, it is dark out. Please, just call me back. I wanna know that you're okay. - What can I start you off with? - Hi. I have a question. Um, have you ever seen this guy before? I really need to talk to him. He's standing out front of your restaurant. I'm worried he's gonna hurt someone. It's my baby, and I know that sounds crazy, it's really hard to explain but... I'm desperate. - He's not the person you think he is. Not anymore. That community outreach thing he did... It really changed him. - He's in the catering core? - That's South Korea. He's been there for the past six months. - Thank you. - Hello? It's Helen. - Hey, it's Susie. I really need your help. I'm coming to pick you up. You know, you can stay in the car if you want. - No, of course not. Besides, what's the point of me coming if I just hide? - Okay. - Excuse me, what do you think you're doing? - My friend, uh, lives here, and they're not answering. - I don't know you, I can't just let you in. - Can you help me? I'm looking for this person, Lorna Morgan. That's not Lorna, that's Madison. - Madison? - Madison Clark. But I haven't seen her in days. - This is a dead end. Okay... - Thank you. I should phone the police, right? What if I do and then what if they do something to the baby? My baby, oh gosh. I feel like I'm going crazy. - There is another way. But you need to find out everything you can about Lorna Morgan. - Okay, um... We could start with her brother, I mean, his old place. - Yeah. - I just need to know that they're safe. - You need to get some sleep. - Oh, God. I must be out of my mind. Panama? Oh my God. Okay. Okay, I'm calling the cops. - No! No, please, the note says, "Do not call the police." I don't want to risk my baby. - Okay, Andy told me that Lorna had reached out to him, that her brother Paul had told her about your problems and she wanted to help. I know he asked her questions, so he must have been satisfied with the answers. - Yeah, well Paul is a whole other issue altogether. Apparently he smashed some guy over the head with a bottle and ended up in prison and just got out six months ago. And then I went by Lorna's apartment, and there was a woman there, and I showed her a picture of Lorna and she said her name is actually Madison. - Andy was just trying to help, Suze. - I know. I just wanna find my baby. - I know. - Madison Clark... Who are you? - Suze? What are you doing out here? I saw you downstairs. - I wanted to see where Mike... Where it happened. - I know. Let's go inside, we can talk. - Do you think he kept secrets from me? Like, do you think Mike didn't tell me things? - I didn't see much of him in that last year, truth be told. It wasn't like in the early days. I mean, I was always out seeing clients day in and day out and he was here holding down the fort. - When did you last talk to Paul Morgan, like, face to face? - I haven't. I mean, I did reach out to him via instant message when Lorna showed up just to see if he wanted to go for a beer, but I never heard back. Why do you want to know? Suze, I'm worried about you. - I'm worried about my baby. That's all I can think about day and night. Oh it's Helen, she's calling. Hey, Helen. It's me. I've got you on speaker. What do you got for me? - So, my brother Pete, who was a cop, he has a buddy from those days who went into private investigation. According to him, Madison has loads of massive debts, mostly with one company. The company operates out of a complicated shell system that... - Let me guess, Panama. - Yeah, Panama. I see you've been busy digging too. Anyway, Pete's friend is confident he can unravel it all. So far it's pointing to an entity in the US, probably on this side of the country. He said he'll get back to me in the next 24 hours. If he can track down copies of the documents that prove all of this, he'll send them over. News as it happens. - Thank you. - I... - Oh, we're here. - Stay here. I'll handle this. - You were told to come alone. - Hey, I'm her brother, you talk to me, not her. Listen, all we want is... Hold on, take it easy. Take it easy. - Help! Help! Help! - Lorna! They're getting away! No! I should have done what he said. I should have come alone... and we'd have her back by now. - Ow. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Susie, we have to call the police. I mean, you can't deal with people like this. Kidnappers, gunmen... - And you think that was Paul and he's involved somehow? - I don't know, I mean, I didn't get a really good look. Andy... Wouldn't Mike have known Paul? - I don't think so. Mike? Susie, what's going on? I don't even know anymore. - No, Andy, you can stay here if you'd like. I can get some blankets for the couch. - Ah, it's okay, I think I'll just head back to my place. - Okay. Susie, I'm calling the police now. - No, can you just... I just need a few more hours. Helen is sending over the documents that she talked about in the car. They're transferring right now. I know digging like this... it seems like a last resort, but... I will search to the ends of the earth to find my baby. To the day I die if I have to. - Come on. Don't die on me now. And... uploaded. Ah! - Helen! Where is she? Oh dear! What did you send me, Helen? Oh, my God. Michael Ashcroft... It's Mike. - Hi there, this is Grace. I can't get to the phone right now, so leave your name and number and I will call you back. - Grace! It's Mike. - It can't be, it doesn't make any sense. - I know. I know it's not actually him but... what if it is? What if Mike was never really who I thought he was? - Susie, we buried him. - It's crazy but... I'm just grasping at straws, at like anything at this stage. What? Grace, what? - Okay, I never told you at the time, it was right before Mike passed away, about 18 months ago, and I was having a day out in that little arts and crafts type place about 20 miles outside of town at Barford. I was at a bistro there and I saw Mike. With a girl. And they were together, together, you know? But I was behind her so... I couldn't see, but it was so strange because for a fleeting moment, I thought it was you. But like, when we first met. - Lorna? - I don't know, sweetie. It's possible. It is possible, I mean, he wouldn't be the first person to take out life insurance on himself and then try to throw a scam to get his hands on it. - Didn't you say I reminded you of her? - Yeah. But like, ten years ago. I'm phoning the police. - Oh, finally, the... Oh, sweetie, you're shaking. Have a brandy and I'll call, okay? - Okay. - Hello. Yes, I'd like to report a crime. Kidnap, extortion, harassment, possibly fraud, we don't know. 271 Woodview Drive. I will. You know there's something about Lorna that just never sat right with me. - Stupid thing is, is that she actually seemed quite lovely when I Googled her. - Well, Mike has good taste. - What was that? - Wait here. - Grace? Oh, my God! Ah! Oh, ah... - Susie? - Is my baby okay? - Baby's fine. She was just kicking a half hour ago. - Oh, thank God. Thank God. Oh I need to get out of these hand ties. - Susie, you're gonna hurt yourself. - Help! Help! - I tried that. Nobody's coming. - I'm not stupid, Lorna. Or should I say, Madison? I know that you two are working together. Where is he? Where is he hiding? - What? - Mike. The two of you, I mean, I've seen the proof... His signature, his... it's all over the documents, and his papers, and you two were spotted out. What is your plan? Are you... Are you gonna try and steal my baby? - I don't have any idea what you're talking about. - I don't know what kind of games you're trying to play here... but they're not gonna work! What is this, some kind of insurance scam? Where is he? - Susie... You got it all wrong. - I've had it wrong since the moment I met you. - It's not me! It's not Mike, I've never even met Mike! Because he's dead. - No... - Mike is dead. - I almost wished it was him. Just so I could see him one more time. Why should I believe you, anyway? - Because I can tell you the truth. I was about to go to college and my mom got sick. So I dropped out to stay home and care for her. That's when I got into debt. Really bad debt. At first, he even introduced himself to me as Mike. Andrew. He's been masquerading as Mike, forging his signature. - What? - Andrew lent me money. A lot of money. But he was charging me crazy high interest rates and my situation just got worse and worse. When I couldn't pay, he had me helping out with some small time grifts, making scam phone calls. And... the big one. You. - Me... - The life insurance payout Mike left you. You know, I didn't even want to be pregnant. But now, it's amazing how protective you get. Anyway, I had to pretend to be some guy's little sister. Paul, someone Andy knew. Paul had just gotten out of prison. Andrew got him in debt up to his eyeballs too. - That was Paul on the motorcycle... I knew that was his house. - After I got pregnant, something must have happened because Andy got really desperate. He pulled together some documents so he could run as soon as he got the money. But I managed to grab some of them, to have something to protect myself in case something went sideways. - Lorna, you've got to get me out of these hand ties, hurry. - Hey, sis. I guess Lorna's been filling you in? - Yeah, she's told me how... how badly you've messed things up. - Yeah. I messed up and I messed up and I messed up and I messed up. And now I'm at the end of my rope. Don't. - Andrew it's... it's okay. We can talk about this. - You don't understand. I owe a lot of money to some really, really bad people and they're not just gonna come after me. One gamble would have paid off, I would have been fine. But I had to borrow and shark just to keep them at bay. Now they're coming after me. - Andrew, you need to pay these people! - It is too late for that! They're gonna come for me and make an example out of me! - Lorna! - Ah! Suze, get back here! There's nowhere to run! Suze! Suze, where are you?! - Okay, go, go, quick! - There's no way out. Come back here. - What are you doing? - There's gotta be a paper trail. I'm not gonna let him shred it. Ah, this, Helen sent me some stuff but it doesn't tell the whole picture. I gotta find something else. - What's this? - Bingo. - Michael Ashcroft. - It's his signature but... It's not right. Holy hell, he really did borrow a lot of money from these guys. - They are coming for him. - You dropped this. - We already know everything, Andy. - You were never supposed to see that. - Push the table! Lorna... dammit. Let's try over here. Um, try the elevator. - Okay. No... - It's not working. Maybe here. We have the roof key, we can go to the roof, there's gotta be a fire escape or something... - I don't do well with heights. - Lorna... Madison. When I first found out that you were someone else online... I saw someone who was generous, who was kind, who was brave. You can do this. - I can't let you go, sis. - Just let Lorna go, please. - No, not either of you. - Andy... Andy, I would have given you the money if you had just asked. - It's too late for that now! I gotta get away, and I can't leave any loose ends. - What are you gonna do?! You're gonna shoot someone? You're gonna run away from the police? - I don't know! Why did you have to be so nosy?! - Grace! - Andy! Andy, you're not gonna shoot anybody. - Grace, be careful. - It's okay, it's okay, come on. Give me the gun. - I thought we had a plan. - We did. We did. Get rid of Susie. And keep Lorna until the baby's born. - What? You planned this? - You make it sound so cold. - Then what is it, Grace? - Survival. You have what we need, a large enough lump sump to disappear and never be found. And a baby... to share it all with. - What about me? We'll see how willing you are to play ball. You two go! Up the stairs! Now! Hurry up. Ah! - Come on, Lorna! Run! Ah! - Ah! Ow! - Mike found out the hard way too. - You killed Mike? - I didn't. Andy did. I genuinely like you Suze, but we really need that money and I really, really want that baby. - Grace, stop it! She's my sister! - And I'm your wife! - Well, my flight takes off soon. - Where are you heading off to first? - Vietnam. Then off to Thailand, then hopefully Malaysia. I have some friends who opened a bar there. I'm gonna live the good life for a bit. - No one deserves it more than you do. - Well, I better get going. - Okay. Be good, Michelle Lorna Ashcroft. - Please be sure to send us tons of postcards. - You two are the top of my list. - Great. You wanna wave goodbye? Bye. Hi! Yeah. Subtitling: difuze
