[orchestra playing] He's a swell guy. [knocking] Overture started. Three minutes, kids. Let's get ready. Okay. Well, thanks a lot. Is Virginia here? No, she's not. It's a good thing she's a friend of the producers. ...and has a rich father. Hey! What are you doing here? [interposing voices] Hot dog! Goodness s-- Overture started. Ms. Kitt, three minutes. Ms. Darsling, three minutes. Ms. Carroll, three minutes. Not now! Let's go, kids. Speed it up. Look out, mister. [knocking] AL: Mr. Clary? Mr. Clary? I'm down here, Al. AL: Three minutes. Okay. Have you seen Coocoo? No. She isn't here yet. Oh, here she comes. Good. Coocoo, darling, where've you been? Ronny's been looking all over for you. Coocoo, do you have it? Only half of it. How dumb can you get? Hey, hey. Any more of that, and you'll have me to deal with. My dear, Ms. Virginia De Louce Clayborn. The Man's here. He wants his money. You promised me, and I promised him he'd have it. All of it before curtain time. But Daddy just won't until he sees what I do in the show. You see? I told you to give her something more important to do. --[gruff sigh] You gave your solemn oath. You said, A true Texan never breaks his word. Remember? But Daddy changed his mind. There's nothing I can do, Ronny. Places, everyone. Gee wizz. I've just gotta get dressed. -Oh, all right. AL: Places everyone. Here. Take this. Give it to that man over there. I've got to hurry. -But what should I tell him? -Stall him. Tell him I'll have the rest of it in an hour. But, Ronny-- why me? Monsieur? This way, please. I have something for you. Everybody on stage. [music playing] This way, please. [music playing] AL: Curtain, Mr. Clary. Curtain. [knocking] Hurry, Clary. Change the blackout. [opening music] (SINGING)You've never seen us before. We've never seen you before. What a pleasant place to finally meet. So much pleasanter than a busy street. We vocally take your hand. And vocally shake your hand. And ask you to regard this hullabaloo as our equivalent to How do you do? How do you do, Mr. Orchestra? How'd you do, Mrs. Mezzanine? How'd do you do, Lord and Lady Balcony? You're the welcomest sight we've ever seen. We say it again, Encore! You've never seen us before, but we hope before our musical ends that New Faces and you will be good friends. (SINGING IN FRENCH) (SPEAKING)Cadillac car. Mink coats. [speaking french] Crazy, no? [singing in french] (SINGING)He takes me off this in income tax so when he buys me Cadillacs the FBI won't watch his movements. He writes me off as property improvements. He takes me off his-- Stop. (SINGING)--income-- (SPEAKING)Now? Now. All right. (CLEARS THROAT) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are about to present a new television panel program. We now take you to Washington D. C. (SINGING)He takes me off his income tax. It's time for "Meet the Senate". Each week at this time, an ordinary American citizen meets two members of the Senate. Nothing official. Just a friendly investigation. Good evening, folks, and welcome to "Meet the Senate". I am your genial moderator district attorney, Otto Holly. Our distinguished panel this evening consists of Senator Harold Marble, Republican of Vermont, and Senator Eli Hutchison, Democrat of Missouri. Tonight, we are going to investigate the effect of jazz music on the young people of America. Our guest witness is a musician who specializes in a branch of jazz known as Bop. It promises to be an exciting session. Officer, would you bring on the witness? Mr. Daz Rocko. Greetings, gangs. What's the story? You are Mr. Daz Rocko? Who else, man? My card. I can't stand nothing square. Yes. This is Senator Hutchinson, Senator Marble, and I am the moderator for the panel, Otto Holly. Skin, man. Raise your right hand. Just the right hand. Do you swear the testimony you're about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? Where'd you get them crazy lyrics? Mr. Rocko, it has come to our attention that you as a musician and bandleader exert a tremendous influence upon certain large segments of American youth. They consider you a tangible manifestation of a superior temperament. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Man, I couldn't say that. But let's stop goofing. I'm here to hep you investigating cats. You dig? I know just how you feel, Jim. Mr. Rocko, this panel is interested in finding out something about the nature of your work. You are an orchestra leader, are you not? Mean do I front a combo? Yea, man. In other words, you work is comparable to that of say Mr. Guy Lombardo? That did it! I won't take that even from the government. Please, Mr. Rocko. Be seated. Don't touch the suit, man. You'll make the colors run. Now could you tell us where you and your combo are currently employed? Oh, it ain't no secret, Jim. We make it every night at Booby's Bop House. Just where is this establishment located? On 52nd Street. I don't know the exact address, but it's the only building in the block that moves. Do they serve liquor on the premises? You mean groove juice? They certainly do. Man, every night about 12 o'clock, that joint is the groove juiciest. In other words, if one of your teenage fans wanted to see you, he'd have to come to this night club where intoxicating beverages are sold? No. They don't serve no juice to the kids. We do a special session for the junior jazz licks. Starts at 4 o'clock every Sunday afternoon. When does it finish? Thursday. You mean you stay awake for four days? Doesn't everybody? Man, it's easy if you know the magic word. What magic word? Benzedrine. That's just plain crazy. It's the craziest. But who looks after your little boys? I do, man. Why every morning I give them a nice breakfast-- hot avocado seed soup and a cold glass of maltese milk-- You mean malted milk, don't you? No. Maltese. It's cats' milk. It's awful hard to get, though. You gotta use a very low stool. You dig? Now after that, I give a little Daz's music lesson. Man, that kid's going to be a great musician. He don't know what a melody is. What's his story? Go on, Mr. Rocko. Well, come 10 o'clock, it's time to go to work. So I pick up my horn, which has got a special de-nicotine f-- filter in the mouth piece so's you can blow and smoke at the same time. And I cut out for the [inaudible] and them cats are screaming for me. I get up on the stand. Put out my hand. Kick off the band. Then I pick up the horn and I blow. And the cats line up in a row. And I follow whatever I go. Go. Go. Go. [jazz music playing] Senator! Senator, where's the rest of the committee? They're gone, man. Real gone. ALL:(SINGING)We're awaiting the arrival of a brand new face from France-- a figure of romance who has us in a trance. We hope that he'll be pleased to us waiting by the door. To see us waiting for the man whom we adore. His shadow comes in view. Our senses start to reel. Voila! And sacrebleu. Here is our ideal. (SINGING)Bonsoir. Bonsoir. I'm sorry that I'm late, but I've been signing autographs since a quarter after 8:00. Cheri. Cheri. (FRENCH) In case you don't speak French, it simply means that I love you. I love you all. [inaudible] If I was tall, I'd love you more. But since I'm not, accept me as I am. And who can [inaudible] a mademoiselle you may be my madam. (SPEAKING)Call me madem. (SINGING)Pardon me, monsoir. I'm from the "Morning Star". It's evident that you're a man of fame. It's also very clear I should know who you are, but somehow I just can't recall your name. What! You don't know who I am? What! You don't know who he is? No! Who is he? Yes. (SINGING)I am the man of the hour. I am the man of the year. I am the fellow who is not from here to here to here. I'm the meaning of debonair. (SPEAKING)Who am I? (SINGING)I'm Lucky-- -Pierre! --(SINGING)Pierre. I am the man of the century, the man of the age. Why, my name will be in history on every single page. I'm the man who is always there. (SPEAKING)Who am I? (SINGING)I'm Lucky-- -Pierre! --(SINGING)Pierre. I'm the boy mais oui oui. What a joy to be me. If you think that I'm bragging, if you think that I boast, just be quiet, and you'll hear them shout my name from coast to coast. And the air could resound in the-- Pierre! (SINGING)--air! [inaudible] Lucky Pierre. Pierre! (SINGING)Though he's not very handsome, and he's not very strong. In a cabin in a blizzard, he's the one you bring along. He's a [inaudible] prayer. (SPEAKING)Who is he? He's Lucky Pierre! From the banks of the Hudson to the banks of the Nile, just repeat my name and voila! You'll be serviced with a smile. From [inaudible] to Harold Square. [inaudible] Lucky Pierre. Yea! Yea! (SINGING)He's the bee. We're the flower. (SINGING)Busy bee. Lucky flower. I'm the man of the hour. I'm the man of the year. I am the man that every living husband has a right to fear. [inaudible] where she is, there I am. (FRENCH) Yea! (SINGING)Who am I? I'm Lucky Pierre. (SINGING)Life has been kind to me. I've riches enough to buy whatever catches my eye. But nothing catches my eye. My appetite has faded. Alas, the lady's jaded. When I was a little girl, poor and plain, all I asked of life was in this refrain. Penny candy. Candy for a penny. I wish I could still get a kick from a penny peppermint stick or an indigestible gummy hat that stuck to my teeth and made me fat. Penny candy. Candy for a penny. I wish I could bounce a red ball on the brick of a tenement wall and never ask for more at all, at all. Candy, candy. the candy store I could never pass without pressing my nose against the glass. Candy, candy. And, oh, how I'd [inaudible] for a doll made of sweet chewing wax. Penny candy. Candy for a penny. I ask for more than a penny now. I've grown very wise, you see. But I wish that a sweet were still fun to eat. Now a penny's a memory. CHILDREN:(SINGING) Penny candy. Candy for a penny. (SINGING)I wish I could still get a kick from a penny peppermint stick or an indigestible gummy hat that stuck to my teeth and made me fat. CHILDREN:(SINGING) Penny candy. Candy for a penny.

I've grown very wise, you see. But I wish that a sweet were still fun to eat. Hi, June. Hi, June. Gee. You got your old lady's perfume on? Gussie! Hey, Gussie, we've got two cents left. Should we get a jaw breaker or a liquorice swip? Well, if we get the liquorice swips, we can each have one. CHILDREN: How about us? And besides, the jaw breakers cost two cents each. Well, We could go dibs on it. I could break my jaw for awhile, then your turn. Okay! -Who you hitting? -Look out! You're gonna get hurt. Hey, I'm first naturally. It's my two cents. Hey, mister. Can we please have a jaw breaker? No, not the white one. We like pink. No, not that one on top. That one way down there on the bottom. Oops! Don't spill them. (GASP) Nice shiny pink one. Thank you. Good Gussie. No, it's not your turn yet. You know what I'm gonna be when I grow up? A movie star like Nita Nalley. Mama told me what you're going to be. An elephant. CHILDREN: (LAUGHING) Gee, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Gussie. Maybe when you grow up, you get skinny like a snake. CHILDREN: (LAUGHING) Don't cry, Gussie. Please don't cry. Here. It's your turn for the jaw breaker. If you stop crying, you can keep it. CHILDREN:(SINGING)Penny candy. Candy for a penny. (SINGING)I ask for more than a penny now. I've grown very wise, you see. But I wish that a sweet were still fun to eat. Now a penny are memories. (SINGING)Tropical nights. Orchids in bloom. Sultry perfume. [inaudible] and angels with passionate strangers. I've seen it all. As I recall. I met him in Boston in the native quarter. He was from Havoc just across the border. It was a magical night with romance everywhere. There was something in the air. There always is in Boston. We went to the Cav Bar-- that's an Irish bar there-- the underground hideout of the DAR there. Something inside of me said, watch your heart, mademoiselle. And it might be just as well to watch your purse in Boston. We went to the Common-- that's a pretty park there. As I remember, it was pretty dark there. In this exotic locale by a silver lagoon underneath a voodoo moon, we fell asleep in Boston. That was the story of my one romance there. Our dream of adventure didn't stand a chance there. How could we hope to enjoy all the pleasures ahead when the books we should have read were all supreme in Boston? Exotic Boston. Land of the free, home of the brave, home of the Red Sox, home of the bean, and home of the Boston [inaudible] [music playing] How does it look? Does he like it? It's too dark. I can't see him. Why are you worried? Because my father doesn't want me to be an actress. He's done about everything to try and stop me. Now I guess he succeeded. What do you mean? I have a terrible feeling about the money. So we won't get the money. So the show closes. You still won't go back to Texas. You don't know my father. Well, tell him-- tell him you won't go back. And why? Because-- because [french] Mr. Clary, you better get ready. And that's why. Oh it's right fancy things about love. They complicate it so. [singing french] Love just as I know. Love is a simple thing. Love is a silver ring, shiny as a ribbon bow, soft as a quiet snow. Love is a nursery rhyme. Oh there's the tick of time. Love is so many things right, as an angel's wings, gentle as the morning light, long as a winter night. Love makes an old heart sing. And it feels every empty space. Love is a warming place. Love is a simple thing. Love is a simple thing. Love is a silver ring, shiny as a ribbon bow, soft as a quiet snow. Love-- [singing french] Love is unforgettable. [singing french] [singing french] [singing french] Love is a simple thing. Love is a breath of spring. Love is a simple thing. Love is a magic ring. More fun than a puppet show, right as a scarlet bow. Love is the thunder and rain. Love is a soaring plane. Love is a pink balloon and as a old buffoon, wild as a storm as sea, love is sheer insanity. Love is a touch of spring, and it gives a sudden grace. Love is a special place. Love is a simple thing. Love is a simple thing. Love is a silver ring. [speaking french] Love is a touch of grey, and it gives you a sudden grace. Love is a special place. Love is a simple place. I've been called names by many a bride. I admit, they cause me pain. But lately I've been classified as a long-term capital gain. He takes me-- Now. Ladies and gentlemen, the next scene is about a famous author. To quote from the jacket of his latest book, quote, "Mr. Kaput is 30-years-old, wears a checkered vest, has black hair, and bangs," unquote. He takes me off his income tax. Hi y'all. I just wrote another book and I've been aching to tell somebody about it. I do all the writing, right here in this little old hamlet. Now the leading character in my book is one Jerald Fenwick. I was going to have two Jerald Fenwick's but there ain't enough women to in here to go around as is so we'll leave him alone. Now Jerald and his mother [inaudible] live on remains of their plantation, Fenwick's Folly. I like to read a little bitty here just to give you a sort of idea of what's happening inside. "Jerald decided there was only one thing to do about the matter, even though the thought of doing anything about anything filled him with revulsion and fright and a kind of a fear too. 'My choice leaves in one direction only,' he said, 'and that is to marry Melanie Monticello.' There was something alive about Melanie. Something alive! And I swear Jerald could not stand something alive. But that night he told his mother of his decision anyway. There she was in the living room, rummaging through the mail due contents of an old copper trunk. 'Mother,' said Jerald, 'I have something to tell you. I'm going to marry Melanie Monticello.' 'Now don't you be a silly dear,' said his mother, 'you know she's your sister on your father's side, so you just shut your mouth. Shut it up.' Just then the house gave a slight lurch as the termites finished with the south wing. 'Mother?' 'What now?' She smiled softly as she settled slowly into the trunk for the last time. And as the lid nipped off the end of her itty bitty nose, she look at her son significantly and she said, ouch." But I ain't going to read no more of my book now cause I want y'all to buy a copy when it's published. So you could read for yourself in the next chapter, the very strange and decadent and even amusing way I pick to get rid of everybody. Then for 232 pages, they ain't no people. Oh, before I go, I would like to say one thing. A lot of literary critics have been telling y'all that I'm a an unhealthy author. I ain't unhealthy, folks. I'm sick. "We were too rich, too beautiful for true love." That's what mama and papa said. I wonder if they were right. Mama is gone. Papa too, leaving two little girls with nothing to do. Time for tea. Time for tea. [inaudible] come to tea. Dusty, dusty tea pot, you're as old as I. Can't anyone be as old as I. They can if they try. They can if they try to be as old as I. Just [inaudible] with a memory, in an empty house and see. You should be old as-- should be as old as-- should be as old as me. As I. You'll soon be as old as we. Poor old house, aren't you weary of us? We'll never leave you. Never go out the door. What for? We were born in this house, you know, trillions of years ago. But just a year apart. We were [inaudible]. House you were young then like us, and oh what beauties we were, we three. The house, and thee, an me. Remember our debut, in 1902. I was 18 in 1902. My gown was made in France by [inaudible] for the dance. Mine was from [inaudible] with pale pink saffron bow, and silver bells and cockle shells, and pretty old [inaudible] in a row. The musician's played encore, encore. I barely flew around the ballroom floor. But I failed to fall in love that night. Though the men were handsome and my [inaudible]. I never fell in love. Through the door came John, and he met me with a smile. And we waltzed and we waltzed, then we stopped for a while to dream. John was the man for my heart, though we'd only met to part. For papa appeared with a righteous flare. He saw us kissing behind the stair. And his eyes were as cold as the sea. His eyes were as cold as the sea. That was the last I saw of John, and the last John saw of me. Remember our debut in 1902. I never fell in love. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. "We were too rich, too beautiful for true love." That's what momma and papa said. I wonder if they were right. Time for tea. Time for tea. You'll soon be as old as-- soon be as old as-- soon be as old as me. As I. You'll soon be as old as we. [inaudible]. I refuse to paint this. I can't get Alouette out of my mind. Everybody think that Alouette is a girl. But it's a bird. You know, when I was a little kid in France, everyday I used to sing about Alouette. Allouette, [inaudible] Alouette. Alouette, I pick up your feather. Alouette, [inaudible] Aloutette. I pick up your feather from your head, from your eyes, from your beak, from your neck, from your-- from your this, from your body. Alouette-- [singing in french] Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me. I've been an awful good girl. Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight. Santa honey, a '54 convertible too, light blue. I wait up for you dear, Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight. Think of all the fun I've missed. Think of all the fellows that I haven't kissed. Next year I could be oh so good, if you check off my Christmas list. Santa honey, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot. Been an angel all year, Santa baby. And hurry down the chimney tonight. Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed to a platinum mine. Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight. Santa baby, and fill my stocking with a duplex and checks. Sign your x on the line, Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight. Come and trim my Christmas tree, with some decorations bought at Tiffany. I really do believe in you, let's see if you believe in me. Santa honey, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring. I don't need on the phone. Santa honey, and hurry down the chimney tonight. Hurry down the chimney tonight. Hurry, tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention. You are probably quite aware that the Marquise de Quiver has done it again. In societies circles his latest masquerade ball was rated second, only to the crowning of Elizabeth. Well at great expense and time, we will do with this masquerade ball as a command performance, with original music, lyrics, and choreography. In other words, a musicale entitled, "Waltzing in Venice," or, "Take off the Mask." Waltzing in Venice with you, isn't so easy to do. If you should take one more step and you are daft, you will be doing the waltz under water. Oh! What joy could ever compare with waltzing in Venice with care. What a thrill when the waltz is fast one, knowing each step may well be your last one. For [inaudible] waltzing in Venice with you. Waltzing in Venice with you, isn't so easy to do. If you should take one more step and walk off, you will be doing the waltz under water. Oh, what joy ever compare, with waltzing in Venice with care. What a thrill when we're waltzing a fast one, knowing each step may well be your last one. For [inaudible] waltzing in Venice with you. Take off the mask, please take off the mask. I love you. I love you anyway so I ask you, take off the mask you wear. Please prepare, won't you lose your aplomb and take off the garment. Oh your hiding behind it. It's no secret to me that you'll turn out to be my ideal. Oh! But I feel that I've known ya, in Estonia. And I want to laugh for ya, down in Latvia, or the things I've been to ya, in India. Oh, India. [laughing] Oh, well. I haven't forgotten, so please don't be rotten, and take off your mask, that's all that I ask you to do. But please take off your false face and just let me waltz space to face with you. No, no, no, you naughty boy. Although you may think me haughty, boy. I must refuse what you're asking me. You must not think of unmasking me, before 12:00, that is how the day will see. [laughter] Put the mask away. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you saucy miss. No! I will be bold and force you, miss. Till midnight, I don't choose to wait. Matter of fact, I refuse to wait. So take off your mask. That's just what I'm going to do. Put back the mask. That's all that I ask you to do. [inaudible] with you. I hope I was all right. You think they liked it? Virginia, your father wants to see you out there. Mr. Clayborn, wait until you see Virginia in the last half of the show. That's fine. Fine. That's what I'll do. But the man's waiting for his money, and-- Well, tell him you'll just have to wait for it. Ronny's been so wonderful to me, Dad. Please give him the money now. You see, I promised him you would. Oh, Virginia, I've told you right along, before I give you all the money, I have to see all the show. But you don't understand. Oh, I understand very well, my dear. I'm more anxious about your career than you are. I appreciate how you feel, sir, but you see, I promised the man he'd have his money before showtime, and-- I'll come back before the show is over. And don't worry about the money, son. A Texan never breaks his word. It's just a matter of good business, right? A program, Mister Clayborn. Oh, thank you very much, sonny. [knocking] [uptempo music] [applause] Girls, the Trip of the Month club is very happy to announce that last month's prize winner is here with us today. And I'm sure that Mr. Canker has a very interesting story to tell us about his prize-winning pleasure trip to darkest Africa. Mr. Canker? Hola! Va va va America. Who ba ba la la Africa. Hello, America. Hello, America. Africa says hello. [chuckling] I've just come from Africa, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are responsible for my being sent to the Congo. Your generous donations far exceeded anything my late wife or I anticipated. And the only way I know of really showing my thanks for those four swell days is to share with you some of the highlights of our trip. Just keep your seats. I'm going to be all right. One of them cobra snakes struck me right between the eyes. You know how that feels. The doctor wanted to take a look at it, but I'm set on finishing this tour, so I've just been taking aspirin and doping a little. There are several approaches to the jungle. My wife and I tried them all. But we found being dropped from a plane the most satisfactory, although our guide had trouble with his parachute, and jumping them broke both his ankles. [chuckling] But guides are a dime a dozen down there, and we got us another guide right away. The safari was there already waiting for us, and we jumped. And they all began yelling and throwing flowers and fruit at us. Made you feel warm all over. After an hour or so of this tomfoolery, we hit out on the trail. Our destination for that first day was the source of the Nile, the longest-- and I might add, the dirtiest river in the world. Oh, but it was stinkin'. Our pack mules would fall down and play dead when it came time to water them. It gets dark fairly early in the jungle. We pitched camp about a quarter after 4:00. In spite of the stench, I slept like a tot. That jungle area is wonderful for sleeping. So you want to take along plenty of blankets and guns. The next morning was one of those mornings when you hear the screech of the orangutan, the roar of the lion, and the trees were full of beautifully colored birds and snakes. Rembrandt couldn't have captured that beauty. It was one of those mornings you feel like just running around barefoot. But we'd only been tramping on the trail about four or five hours, and my wife began to complain of her feet. The only shoes she had with her were those high-heeled sling pumps. Well, she just couldn't take it, so we had to leave her there out on the trail. A couple of days later on the way back, I found this piece of her dress along with her purse and gloves. And to this day, I don't know what happened to her. [chuckling] But what I really remember about that day was it was the only day it didn't rain, and I got to take some dandy snapshots. They're not quite as good as I'd like to have them, but I lost the negatives when I was washed over a waterfall. Now, I'm sorry. As you can see, this first picture is a little blurry. But while I was taking the picture, I got pretty badly gored by a rhinoceros. That laid me up for a couple of day. Luckily though, luckily though-- two woman missionaries pulled me through that scrape. I guess they had gotten gored once or twice themselves, so I suppose they knew what to do. This next picture is a picture of a chief of a friendly native tribe. There aren't too many friendly tribes in Africa. In fact, this is the only one our bunch ran into. Most of them get a little out of hand when you run out of trinkets for them, especially them headshrinkers. Say, they really become sassy. [inaudible] hat on when you talk to them. Well, say-- say, I can see my time's running out here. What I've tried to do is tell and show you some of the things about Africa that aren't in the travel forms. It isn't the nicest place in the world. No, I won't say that. I'll say this. I don't believe I'd recommend it for the whole family. If the children don't hunt, there really isn't too much for them. Thank you. [music playing] (SINGING) It's raining memories. I don't need a weatherman to tell me that. It's raining memories. And it's also raining rain. Just look at my hat. It rained the day that I found you, waiting for a cross-town bus. It rained the night that I lost you. The gods were playing "House on Fire" with us. It's raining memories. Memories of days when you and I were one. It's raining memories! And it's also raining like a son of a gun. Romance is just an empty fizzle. In its grip, I'm a drip in a dreary drizzle. Raining memories on me. You know, he was late today. [singing in turkish] You know, in the old days in Turkey, they say many women had male secretaries. Oh, those Turks. (SINGING) He takes me off his income tax. But after his taxes in '53, he used to have a secretary and a yacht. Now he's left with just a wife and an old TP. He takes me off-- stop! And now, ladies and gentlemen, an exclusive about a boy who fell in love with guess who. He takes me off his income tax-- Well, how am I doing? Great. Just great. But what's the good if the show has to close? Do you think you'll get the rest of the money? (SINGING) What's the matter with me? What's the matter with me? School has let out, and it's way after 3:00. But I'm sitting here with my chin on my knee. Say, what is the matter with me? I should be at home, and I want to go home. But I know darn well I'm not going to go home. So I just sit here with my chin on my knee. What the heck is the matter with me? What if the gang saw me sitting like this? They'd think I was waiting for some girl. So what if they saw me? They couldn't hee-haw me, because I'm not waiting for any girl. Then why am I waiting here for? And why am I watching the door? I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with Miss Logan. I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with Miss Logan. Though I still hate arithmetic, I'll pass arithmetic, long as Miss Logan is teaching arithmetic. I'm in love with Miss Logan, and I wish, I wish I was not. I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love. That's my slogan. With an angel who flies up above. That's Miss Logan. Though the study of history still is a mystery, she teaches history, I love my history. I'm in love with Miss Logan, and I hope nobody finds out. [whistling] Though I don't even know the first name of Miss Logan, I'm in love, I'm in love just the same with Miss Logan. Every school day I speak at her five days a week at her, yet here I sit waiting for one more peek at her. I'm in love with Miss Logan, and I wish that she'd hurry up. Oh, hello, Andre. Hello, Miss Logan. Are you waiting for someone? No, mademoiselle. Everybody's gone home. I'm the last one. I know, ma'am. Did you want to see me? Oh, no, ma'am. Andre! Is there anything wrong? No, ma'am. Are you sure? Yes, ma'am. All right, then. Coming, Andre? -No, ma'am. -Andre. Mary! Darling! Sorry I'm late. Easy. Not in front of the little boy. Good night, Andre. See you tomorrow. He's a funny little fellow. Sweet, though. If there's one person that I don't love, it's Miss Logan. If there's one person I'd like to shove, it's Miss Logan. She could talk to me, sing to me, candy bars bring to me, hold me and cling to me, don't mean a thing to me. I don't love old Miss Logan, and I wish-- I wish I was dead. "Harry the Heel, notorious pickpocket, believed seen in local area." Hello, Harry. -Hello, May. -You look tired. How'd it go today? Oh, what's the sense in talking? The little man ain't got a chance. Today, in order to get someplace, you gotta be a big operator. What happened, Harry? I made $8. Is this what a man should bring home to his wife? May, I'm 53 years old. I made $8! And I was darn lucky to make that. Thank goodness there was a parade today, or I might have ended up with a lousy $2. Then you made $6 at the parade. Now, tell me about it. Well, there were a lot of cops around, and I was nervous. May, something's happening to me. I'm getting so I can't pick pockets when cops are around. I was never like that, was I May? No, Harry. You were never like that. Tell me I was never like that. You were never like that, Harry. I was never like that. You were never like that! I was never like that. By the way, where's the kid? Oh, he's around. Around where? Well, he just went down to the corner to-- he's down in the playground playing baseball with the other boys. Baseball? Harry. This is how a boy amounts to something? This is where my teaching and training go? Wasted all, wasted on a boy who takes a bat in his hand and smashes his father's hopes and dreams. Come on. Eat your spaghetti, Harry. It's getting cold. May, this country's going insane. All a boy thinks of is becoming a Joe DiMaggio. Sit down, Harry. I talk to him, and he doesn't listen to me. May, I've failed. I've failed as a father. No, Harry. And he won't fail you. He's got your blood in him. I'm not a well man. I'm not a well man. Hello, Mom. Hiya, Dad. You're not ashamed to say hello to your father? No, I'm not ashamed. Am I, Mom? Hiya, Dad. You're not ashamed to waste your time in playgrounds when you should be learning your craft? Why, when I was your age, I was breaking into candy stores already. Why's he gotta holler? You're no good. You're well liked. Stanley, I'm your father. And believe me, I know what's best for you. I'll help you. I'll teach you. Stanley, oh god, don't you ever want to become a criminal? Sure, Dad. Then in the name of Dillinger, why don't you listen to me? Because you holler. Stanley, I know how hard it is to start. I'm not asking you to do impossible things. Begin at the bottom. Start small. Put slugs into pay telephones. Steal at school. Punch your buddy in the mouth. Stanley, listen to your father. Sure, Dad. Hey. Hey. That reminds me. This is the end of the term, isn't it? Uh-huh. OK, where's the report card? I lost it. Show your father the report card. No, I won't. Come on, give me the report card. No, I won't. All right. I guess there comes a time in every boy's life when he thinks he can lick his father. If you think that time has come, I'd like to know about it. Harry. May. May! Think you can whip your old man, huh? The old man [inaudible], son. Come on, son. May! Why won't the boy listen to me. Stanley, show your report card to your father. Oh, sure, Dad. Gee, I wish you wouldn't look at it. A? I'm sorry. B-plus? Look, Dad, I tried-- A? He didn't mean it. B-plus? A? A? (SHOUTING) A! A! A! A! A! A! You're killing that man. That's a sick man. Pay attention! Oh, Stanley, follow in his footsteps, or you'll put your father in his grave. Stanley! Stanley! Remember, you're an only son, and you mean so much to us. Oh, please. For his sake and mine, steal something. Anything! I know you can. I know deep down inside, down where it really counts, you're rotten. Thanks, Mom. Mom, I love him and I love you too. You know that. [inaudible] wrong with me. I got crazy blood in me. I'm a misfit like Uncle Fred, the cop. You must never mention that man's name in this house. Oh, Mom, I gotta tell you something. I know it's gonna sound strange, but you got me-- Ma, I got a job. An honest job. I told you never to use that kind of-- Stanley, oh, son, you've come through! A Tommy gun. My boy's got a-- what the heck is this? It's a violin. I love it. I want to be a great musician. You want to be a-- Dad! There'll be no musicians in this house! Do you hear me? [screaming] Stanley, come back! Let him go. He's not my son. We'll go on together alone. Go get my tools. I'm gonna crack a safe tonight. When I'm lost in my work, I kinda forget the pain of life. Now, don't forget what you went through, Harry. It's a Thompson safe with a 4.4 tumbler combination. Don't use too much nitro, and don't forget to eat your sandwiches. And remember, the watchmen are changed at 10:15. And Harry, don't look-- Nag, nag, nag! There's the man. Harry the Heel, my father. OK, where's the reward? Here you are, son. $500. May! May, the boy turned in his own father. His own flesh and blood for a filthy reward, May. Our boy's a stool pigeon! He's gonna be all right! He's gonna be all right! He's gonna be all right! [knocking] Everything will work out, honey. You'll see. If your father doesn't give the money and the show closes, well, there'll be other shows. For you, yes. But not for me. What are you saying, darling? Daddy's right. I don't belong here. I guess I better go back and [inaudible] Texas with him. At least everyone there won't laugh at me. I don't laugh at you. You are a charming, talented, beautiful girl. Where I go, you go. Because-- because [speaking french]. That is, if you want me. Why, Robert, what are you saying? [speaking french]. In English. Well, I look at you through my heart, and I see the only girl in the world for me. Oh, Robert. (SINGING) I just got in from Salem, and I'd like to get the facts. Someone named Lizzie Borden has done something with an ax. And you're worried because the hoedown usually held on Saturday night might be ruined because of Lizzie. Is that your problem? Right. What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown now? Something wrong with the hoedown? What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown now? What went wrong with the hoedown? What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown since Elizabeth...? What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown now? What happened? Don't you know what happened yesterday morning, some time between 10 o'clock and noon? The thing that happened without any warning. The biggest news since Mr. Hughes went up in that balloon. What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown now? You mean the trial of Lizzie? What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown now? It's gonna keep you busy. What in the world's gonna happen to the hoedown? Will we let the hoedown go down? What in the world's gonna happen since she caught her parents napping? What in the world's gonna happen to the Saturday afternoon hoedown now that Lizzie Borden took her ax and gave her parents 81 whacks, Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave them whacks! Now, as I see it, Lizzie Borden is slightly out of step, because she made them put off the hoedown. Is that the problem? Yep. That means the regular social function can't be held because of the trial. Of course we get an injunction. Or else we could-- Wait a while. Go tell Mrs. Elmer Drury to come down here and sit on the jury. Go get Ebeneezer Bernie. Who is he? District attorney. And tell Mrs. Jones to leave her fudge and go to the bedroom to wake up the judge. Get Miss Lizzy to bring that ax and come on down with a couple of facts. I got a plan that'll make you smile. We'll have the hoedown with the trial. Come on, everybody. We'll have the hoedown with the trial. Howdy, Lizzy. Howdy, Judge. Where's Mr. Bernie? District Attorney? There he is, Judge. There he is, Judge. Order in the court. Lizzie, don't budge. Hello, folks. Howdy, sonny. Yesterday in old Fall River, Mr. Andrew Borden died. Now they got his daughter Lizzie on the charge of homicide. Some folks say she didn't do it. Others say, of course she did. But we all agree Miss Lizzy B is a problem kinda kid. Because you can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Not even if it's planned as a surprise. No, you can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. You know our neighbors love to criticize. Now, she got him on the sofa where he's gonna take a snooze. And I hope he went to heaven, because he wasn't wearing shoes. She sorta rearranged him with a hatchet, so they say. And then she got her mama in that same old fashioned way. Because you can't chop your mama up in Massachusetts. Not even if you're tired of her cuisine. No, you can't chop your mama up in Massachusetts. You know it's almost sure to cause a scene. Well, they really kept her hopping on that busy afternoon, what with down and upstairs chopping while she hummed a ragtime too. They really made her hustle, and when all was said and done, she removed her mother's bustle when she wasn't wearing one. Because you can't chop your mama up in Massachusetts. And then blame all the damage on the mice. No, you can't chop your mama up in Massachusetts. That kinda thing just isn't very nice. Now, it wasn't done for pleasure and it wasn't done for spite, and it wasn't done because the lady wasn't very bright. She always did the slightest thing her ma and papa said. They said Lizzie, cut it out. And that's exactly what she did. Because you can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. And then get dressed and go out for a walk. No, you can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a far cry from New York. Now, what do we do now? Let's have a hoedown. What do we do about her? About me? About you? [inaudible]. Did you do it, Liz? Dear me, no. - Is that good enough for you, Judge? - I guess so. Is that good enough for you folks? -Yes! -Then, Lizzie, you're free. Yes! Oh, you can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Shut the door and lock and latch it. Here comes Lizzie with a brand new hatchet. You can't chop your mama up in Massachusetts. Cross your fingers, knock on wood. Local gal is making good. You can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Such a snob, I heard it said, she met a pa and cut him dead. You can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Jump like a fish. Jump like a porpoise. All take hands and habeas corpus. You can't chop your papa up in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a far cry from New York. Oh, Lizzie Borden, Massachusetts is a far cry from New York. [whistling] You know, in France, we usually celebrate our Fourth of July by having what you call a block dance. We dress ourselves as American jitterbugs and cowboys. [speaking french]. She says, it was the 14th of July. [speaking french]. The streets were all decorated with lanterns. [speaking french]. She meets a boy. [speaking french]. And naturalement, they fall in love. [singing in french] When I first met you, there you stood under a lantern all alone. Blue, green-- your bright shining eyes made my head turn upside down. Remember the old man who tried to talk politics? We could scarcely hear him. For us, [inaudible]. It's a night I'll always remember. [singing in french] [humming] It was wonderful. Wonderful. Virginia, you were great, dear. Just great. Oh, thanks, Dad. I always knew you'd be a hey cuckoo. I mean Virginia. Well, here you are. Dad, I've got a surprise for you. I'm going to be married. Married? Well, congratulations, son. How tall are you? Oh, about six feet, I guess. Six feet? Oh, that's wonderful. That's the way we like them in Texas. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me, Virginia. Dad, this is the man I'm going to marry. (SINGING) Everyone gets into a dull routine if they don't get a chance to change the scene. I could not be wearier. Life could not be drearier if I lived in Siberia. I'll tell ya what I mean. I met a rather amusing fool while on my way to Istanbul. He gave me the Black Sea for my swimming pool. Monotonous. For 30 days, salt air I sniffed while I was shipwrecked and cast adrift with a man who looked like Montgomery Clift. Monotonous. For what it's worth, throughout the earth, I'm known as femme fatale. When the yawn comes up like thunder, brother, take back your Taj Mahal. Jack Fath made a new style for me. I even made Johnny Ray smile for me. A camel once walked a mile for me. Monotonous. Monotonous. I could not be wearier. Life could not be drearier if I lived in Siberia. Traffic has been known to stop for me. Prices even rise and drop for me. Toscanini played bop for me. Monotonous. Monotone-eous. Ah! There are such demands for me. A man of distinction switched brands for me. Macy's and Gimbal's shook hands for me. Monotonous. Monotonous. Monotonous. Everything's going to be all right, Robert. Are you sure, darling? Daddy's going home tonight. Oh, I almost forgot. EARTHA: (SINGING) Ah! Here. I better hurry. I could not be wearier! Life could not be drearier if I lived in Siberia. Though I know I've acres of dough, I'm not sure of the amount. It might be exciting someday if I learned to count. Chian Kai-Shek sends me pots of tea. Gaylord Hauser sends me vitamin D. They wrote for me. Monotonous. Monotonous. Monotonous. (SINGING) I take him off my income tax. I buy him anything I please. He doesn't cost very much. And goodness, he's so nice to squeeze. Now? Now! Ladies and gentlemen, the next number really needs no introduction. And so, we won't make any. Now? Now! I take him off my income tax. I buy him anything I please. He doesn't cost me very much. We hope to see you again. We hope you see us again. What a pleasant way to finally be. We hope you can [inaudible]. We vocally took your hand. And vocally shook your hand. And asked you to regard this hullabaloo as our [inaudible] our thanks to you. Our thanks to you, Mr. Orchestra. Thanks to you, Mrs. Mezzanine. Thanks to you, Lord and Lady Balcony. You're the nicest people we've ever seen. We say it again. Encore. We're ready to [inaudible]. And we're hoping as our musical ends that new faces and you are now good friends.
