NETFLIX AND DINGIE PRESENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH DUTCH FILMWORKS WITH THE SUPPORT OF L'OFFICE TOURISME LES GETS AND THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT THE CLAUS FAMILY 3 What's keeping them? The train will leave any minute now. - I'll go and look for them. - I'll join you, we do everything together. - Noor. - What? Jules, Grandpa. Where were you? The train is leaving soon. Bad start, Noël. And the holiday hasn't even started yet. - We're going skiing, we're going skiing. - Hey, how old are you, really? - I'm ten years old. - More like five. Jules, Noor, stay here. Where did Jet go? At platform 1, the 11:34 Dingie Ski-Express to Inssbruck will depart… That's our train. Jules, Noor, we're leaving, let's go. - Alright. - Come one. Watch out. So guys, finally we're all going on holiday together. Very nice. Really so nice. Just amazing. Jet? Do you have it? Beautiful. - Is it a good idea? - Of course, it's an amazing idea. Isn't it too soon? For the kids? The kids also think it's amazing, you told me yourself. And this skiing holiday is the perfect opportunity. That's why we're going on this holiday. The only thing we need to do now, is to find the perfect moment to propose. And I've brought everything I might need. I just fell in the snow, head first. Only thing you could see, were my ski's. - Do you think that's funny? - Yes. Okay Felix, focus. This is your schedule for today. If you ever want to be a champion skier, you'll have to train really hard. We'll start with… You don't have time for that. I told you to focus. Your training is all that's important. Winning is the only thing that matters. You want that, right? Just like your dad. Yeah… We start in the morning with 20 minutes runs, and after that… - Are you going skiing? - Me? On those little slats? Never in my life. I am. I'm going to be the best skier ever. I don't think so. You bet I will. - Yeah? - Yes. Okay. - First put on your PJ's. - No, I'm not going to sleep. If you want to become the best skier ever, you need to be well-rested. - Go on. - Alright then. - But I'm taking the top bunk. - No way. Yes, I am. Five years old, really. Jules, Jules. Later, in my cabin? - Okay, once Noor is asleep. - Make sure no one sees you. Okay. Noor? - Hey, Grandpa. - Hey, Jules. - Is Noor asleep? - Like a baby. - Time for the presents. - Jules, wait. Sit down. Son, if we use our magic snow globe to go to the North Pole right now to get the Christmas present for the kids and bring them round and then want to go back, we won't come back here. We'll come back to my home, at my shop in Belgium. While your mother, Noortje and the others are in a hotel in… - In Austria. - Yes. We need to wait for now. We need to wait until we have a room in the hotel and then we can… - Reset the home button of the snow globe. - Exactly. In the meantime, we should come up with a plan to stay away from the hotel without anyone noticing. What was that? - What's all this stuff you brought along? - Just some nice scarfs. - Nice scarfs? - Yes. You never know. It's definitely going to snow, but it could also be suddenly become really hot. You never know. - There you go. - Thank you. So, did I tell you the truth, or not? Ella. - Hello. - Hi. - What do you think? - I'd wouldn't mind working here as well. Maybe in about ten years or so. - Shall I show you the rooms? - Yes. - Guys, are you coming? - This way. Yes, I'm the first one. Very nice. There you go. Jef and Suzanne's room. Jet's room. I'll see you later as well. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. - Can you get into every room? - That's the advantage of my job. - There, Noor and Jules' room. - Wow. - We're sharing a room. - Yes. - And here's Noël's room. - I'll give you a hand. No, that's not necessary. You go and explore our room. - So you can pick the best bed, little one. - I'm not little. Of course not. Alone at last. I'll reset the snow globe. Wait a minute. What's this? What? I definitely heard something. I don't hear anything. I think you should get your ears checked, Grandpa. - Ouch, you're sitting on my hair. - I can't see a thing. - You're on my hair. - I'm sorry. A little bit of light would… Holger… - Her idea. - Yeah. But the gifts station is in good hands, Mr. Claus. - Yes? In which hands? - Well, Ikka. And Joel. Joel? - A teddy bear for Fleur. - What? A teddy bear? No way, that's old news. Girls don't want teddy bears, they want dolls. She'll just get a doll. I WOULD LIKE A LEGO FIRE STATION A fire station for Alejandra? Who makes this stuff up? I'll tell you exactly what girls want. Girls want a unicorn with long lashes, extensions and… Purple lip gloss. Girls go crazy over purple lip gloss. And why couldn't a girl play with a fire station? Girls can like that too. What you're saying is ridiculous. Mr. Tough Guy. - Don't fire us. - Mr. Claus would never do that. Right? Right, Mr. Claus? This is perfect for our honeymoon. Is this our bed? Are the springs broken? - Ella. - Hi. I forgot my cuddly toy in Grandpa's room. Could I get the key to go get it? - I can't do that, I'm sorry. - But I miss him so much. - And Grandpa wouldn't mind. - I'll go with you. You don't have to, you're already so busy. You don't want to get fired, right? Quickly, then. Bath beads. And rose-scented foam. And bath bombs. What's wrong with a simple bar of soap? - Do you think it's the maid? - Oh, sweetheart… Or a thief. Holgie, it could be a murderer. And I haven't tried the jacuzzi and breakfast in bed and a massage yet. Will it hurt? Is that the snow globe? - Just breathe, sweetheart. - Breathe… - Grandpa? - Noor? Who are you? I sometimes ask myself the same question. And what is this? Is Grandpa Santa Claus? After me, of course. What? Cool. So you are little Christmas elves? So we're on the North Pole with all the presents, right? - Correct. - Correct. And correct again. Does your grandpa know you're here? I wouldn't… No, wait. Noor, don't. - Mr. Claus won't like this. - No. - Joel, do something. - Who, me? - Look at how big she is. - Can't you… Gunna, Holger? Grandpa forgot his wallet and we need to rent skies, so… Jules? - It's a disaster. - What's a disaster? - Noor is in the cabin. - What? - Exactly that. - Yeah. Jules? What are you doing here? I should ask you the same thing. How did you get this? You're not supposed to know. - Why not? You know too. - That's different. - Why? It's not fair. - I'm Santa Claus, okay? You? Santa Claus? But what about Grandpa? - Grandpa too. We do it together. - Can I be Santa Claus as well? No, of course not. - Why not? - You're way too little. - Little? I'm ten. - More like five. - That's not true. - No, little one? "We're going skiing, we're going skiing." I don't think so. If you want to conquer those mountains, you need a good breakfast, little one. - I'm not little. - Noor, it was just a joke. Not a morning person, just like someone else I know. - Look who's talking. - Me? Almost just as beautiful as the North Pole. Jules? Is something wrong? Nothing I can't handle. Wanna race? - Yeah. - Wait. I won. Silly, right? So? Delivered all the presents? So you didn't think to tell me that your sister discovered the secret Christmas world? Jules? - I just wanted to take care of it. - That's exactly what I mean. I'm still here, I could help you. I thought you'd say that she could join us. And I don't want that. I'm Santa Claus. Waiter, can I get some more spiced wine? Thank you. Listen, Christmas is the most important thing. Dad thought so too. And you said it yourself. I just want to make him proud. Your dad was Santa Claus. The bonified Santa Claus. But he was also your dad and Noor's dad and your mother's pride and joy. For him, you, your mother and your sister were the most important in the world. And he wouldn't want you to exclude your sister. It already happened. So you'll have to work together. And remember, it's not a competition. What if she tells everyone? Then the Christmas world will be in danger. Your sister is more capable than you think. Okay. Thank you. Cheers. Do you call this skiing? On this hill for babies? Be careful not to fall, baby. Whoops, is your family not here to hold your hand? I can do it alone. So I'll have to go to the North Pole without you tonight? The North Pole? - Do you want to play a game? - I'm going to bed. Skiing is tiring. Sleep tight. Okay. Jules, Grandpa? I'd like to, but I think I'll hit the hay a bit earlier tonight. Noor is right. I'm going to bed too. Sleep tight. Good night. I'd like to play a game. Come here. - Did the kids go to bed? - Yes. Yes, this is the perfect moment for your wedding proposal. - Have you been drinking, Jet? - No, I haven't. But they have a jacuzzi here and I've got the perfect bath oil. Nice and soft, nice smell, very romantic. All you need. I don't know. I was thinking more like a candlelight dinner. A candlelight dinner? No, this is way more exiting. A jacuzzi. Yeah… - Did your mom kiss you good night? - Yes. - Alright. That gives us a few hours. - Us too. - Jet. - Mom? Jet. Bath oil. Bath foam. I used the wrong bottle. How could that happen? Noortje, are you sure you want to do this? Yes. I'm really experiencing déjà vu. Because there's no way back after this. - Yes? Okay. - Yes. Then I have one golden rule. You can't tell this secret… Because this is a secret. You can never ever tell anyone. Otherwise Christmas could be in danger. - Yes? - Yes. And don't touch anything. Exactly. Now there's only one thing left. There. Congratulations. We'll go to the North Pole first to get the presents and then we'll go to Mexico. Mexico. You shouldn't do that to your vocal cords, really. Oh, sweetheart… - Mexico. Jules, here. - Thanks. Look… A Christmas tree. And another one, look. Oh, cookies. - Don't touch anything. - Okay. Except when it's for Santa Claus. Okay. I heard something downstairs. Sorry… Enrico. My goodness. Okay… Hide. Who's there? Good evening. Good evening. I'm Santa Claus. Santa. - You're Santa? - Yes. I'm Santa. Are you listening, Enrico? The police, come. - Police. Come on. - Car me lit a, I'll call the police. No police, no. Oh no, not the police. Oh sweetie, yes. A bit more to the left. Exciting right, a honeymoon? Just as exciting as typing out toy lists. Did you say something, Holgie? Noor, I told you not to touch anything. - Now it is exciting. - Get out, I don't want to see you anymore. What happened? Where's Mr. Claus? Sweetheart, put those cotton pads back on your eyes. I'll do your other foot. Jules, do you know anything about Grandpa yet? After your ski lesson, you'll come back here with Jef to have lunch, okay? Jules, you too. - I'm going to have lunch with Grandpa. - Me too. Okay. So where is Grandpa? I haven't seen him all morning. He's on his way. He wanted to sleep in. - And is Jet not coming? - No, she has a headache. Good morning, Hotel Schnee Halm. Yes. Jules, Grandpa Noël for you. - Grandpa? From his room? - Room service? - Grandpa, where are you? - In some prison in Mexico. I don't know where exactly. But Jules, listen. This is the only call I am allowed to make. Don't worry about me, I'll be okay. But you need to take care of Christmas. The presents and everything. And do it with your sister, Jules. - Okay? - Yes. Are we going outside? It's so hot here. - Finally. - Yes, come. Give me your cell phone number. - Dude, seriously? - Yes, zero, four, - five, seven… - Eight. Enough. Your call is now over. Thank you. Grandpa? Grandpa, where are you? Alright, Noor. Ready for the next step? It's actually very simple. Stick your bum out and just sit down. But I'm very scared of heights. What's wrong? Are you afraid of the ski lift, baby? Calm down, boy. You should help her instead of making fun of her. As far as I know, people who help others don't win. And Felix is a winner. Come on, Felix. I'm gonna see where Jules is. I'm never drinking spiced wine again. Here you go. I thought this vacation would be different. What do you mean? I don't know. I thought we'd be together more. I haven't seen Jules this morning and I've barely seen Noor. And they only want to have lunch with Grandpa today. Little children grow up. Just let them. They'll come find you when they need you. You do know what that means, right? You have enough time to focus on Jef and to propose to him. Yeah, like yesterday, right? Just think of yesterday as a rehearsal. But this time it's for real and I know exactly what we'll do. "We?" - Jules? - What? - Do you know where Grandpa is yet? - No. - I'll help you look for him. - I'll do it by myself. I have no time to babysit you. Was that really necessary? Mr. Claus would want you to work together, really. Grandpa isn't here right now, is he? Okay, guys. Let's look up prisons in Mexico. I need to find Grandpa. Just a nice, hot sauna. Where are you going? We don't all have to look at that screen together, right? - And Mr. Claus said he was fine, right? - Yes. And apparently the spa is amazing here. I also want to go to the spa. Are you crying again? You really are a baby. Stop calling me that. It's not true, I'm not a baby. Okay, prove it. On the top of that mountain is an old cabin. I'll race you. Okay. But how? You're afraid of the ski lift. You'll see. Do you happen to know the coordinates for the mountain? - Why do you need to know? - Homework. We're learning about it at school and need to write down the coordinates of our holiday destination. I do have some maps here. Hold on. Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Are you sure you wouldn't rather have stayed in the valley? It's all for the good cause. There. I think that's the perfect spot, there. Just look at that snow and the fog. So romantic. Just like in a Christmas movie. Jef is coming. - What if he says no? - He won't. - How can you know for sure? - I'm a good judge of character. Look, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. That's true. And I've brought something which would melt the heart of a lot of people. Just open that. - Chocolates? - Yes, but not just any chocolates. This is a box full of love. Okay, I'll go before Jef gets here. - No, I have to pee first. - Here? Yeah, it's so fun to pee outdoors. Jet? - How will I ever find Grandpa like this? - There goes our honeymoon. Excuse me? It's awful. For Grandpa. - And our honeymoon. - Yes. Yes, there. You need to scroll down. He doesn't need to scroll down. Let him do it. And later we'll just… - We're taking a break. - We're going to the spa. To the spa. Who put bath foam in the jacuzzi? - Every day? - Yes. We're doing this every day. And we'll keep practicing until we can't anymore. Yes, I've beaten them here. Just because my dad can do it, doesn't mean I can. You just need to try it once, you'll be fine. Jet? Come on. - Hey, buddy. - I don't want to anymore. I want to go home, to my parents and my brother. Felix, I know it's lonely at the top, but tomorrow's qualification is important. - You need to win to become champion. - I don't need to do anything. You do and you know it. Let's go. Down the hill three times, in less than ten minutes. I just want to go home. What? How did you get here? This could help you. A snow globe? How can that help me? Are you making fun of me? Are you too afraid to try it or something? Baby. Why are you doing this? Why not? Okay, good. Do you happen to know your home's coordinates? Come. Here, sit down. I think a candlelight lunch inside is much better. - Now? - Yes, the kids are with Grandpa. - A candlelight lunch? Can I join you? - Definitely. - Nice, with the three of us. - The three of us? No, candlelight meals are always with only two people. Just the two of us. - Where are you going? - To have lunch. Like that? You're not going like that, are you? You, go to you room and freshen up a bit. And you come with me. You need to make a little efoort for a candlelight lunch. Turn around and let me see. What was that? Animals, over there. Animals? Oh… Sorry sweetie, but… This is not what you think. It's just… There were little people over there. Little people? I didn't expect this from you. But Jet, I really am innocent. - Jules? - Grandpa? Jules, I managed to get a phone, but I still haven't spoken to a lawyer. Mr. Claus in jail? I think it might be time for you to come and get me with the snow globe. Do you have more details for me? Details? Yes, well… I can hear water. And I can also hear seagulls. - I can see light. - Seagulls and light? We need more. Flashing light. I can't really explain it. Such a bummer that Mr. Claus doesn't know what the flashing light is. Okay, it's near a light, but we first need to know what light that is. - Hey, shouldn't you be skiing? - Hold on. Grandpa, does the light flash horizontally or vertically? Okay, do you know something that lights up like this? A flashlight? A siren… - A lighthouse? - Yes, that's it. - Thank you. - What are you doing? Something for school. You as well? Come get me, quickly. I have to go, Jules. It worked. - What did he say? - That Felix wants to quit his training. Can you imagine that? I never quit. Training, training, training. That's all I did. No fun trips, no friends, nothing. And what does he do? He just complains all the time. Honey, don't be so hard on him. He's still young. I was also young. And if he doesn't win, he's no longer my son. - I want to go back. - No… Felix, wait. Noor, did you do what I think you did? I just wanted to help. I found the solution. Holgie, tell him. - Jules… - That light flash is a lighthouse. How many prisons will be near a lighthouse? Just tell him. There, just one. - Jules… - Where is the snow globe? Right… - Where's the snow globe? - Very good question. You need to give it back, it's not mine. I'm going to use it to win the qualifications. - If I use it to get down, I'm way quicker. - That's cheating. Don't care, at least I'll have qualified. What if they see you? The snow globe is a secret and it'll get me into trouble. - I'll make sure they won't see me. - I thought we were friends. I don't need friends. What is going on here? You again? Don't you have any manners? Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Felix? Is this discipline? We'll go and get your stuff. Three times up and down the mountain. And you stay here. - Noor exposed the Christmas world? - I told you not to exclude her. Yeah, that was definitely said. I was right not to trust her. There's one golden rule. Never talk about the Christmas world and she did. Yes, but… - Jules. - Grandpa. Jules, hurry up. - Grandpa? - Calm. Grandpa? Are you still there? Grandpa? Come, come on then. Grandpa, are you okay? Come on, Grandpa? I need to find the snow globe. And Noor. Yeah, well… - Noor? - Is this your sister? - Yes. - Keep your eye on her from now on. - Where's the snow globe? - With Felix. And where's Felix? Noor, what did you do? Christmas is the most important thing. - You've betrayed that. - Oh no, Jules. No. And Grandpa. Because of you we can't get him back. He may even be dead already. Noor. Noor, what are you going to do? I'm saving Grandpa. You shouldn't do it by yourself. Wait. - Are we almost there? - No idea. And? Noor? Does he have it? What are we going to do? - I have an idea. - Okay. Help, help. Let me out of here. Help. He's in the closet. - Shouldn't you do this with Jules? - No. It's my fault Grandpa is in trouble. So I need to fix it myself. - This is not the prison. - I'm afraid of heights. Oh, no. The snow globe. No. Noor, stay there and hold tight. Don't move. Stay put, Noor. No, hold on tight. Don't do it. Oh, no. Stay calm. Okay. Grab my hand. Grab it. I need the snow globe. - For Grandpa. - I know. Okay. Hold on, Noor. Okay. Okay. Remain calm. Come on, you can do it. - Grandpa? - Jules, I'm okay. Grandpa. Gunna, Grandpa is still alive. Noor. - What did she do now? - Together… Lighthouse… Oh no, we can't. - Gunna, calm down. - Afraid of heights. - Grab my hand, but it's too small. - Gunna. Gunna, calm down. Tell me what happened. Noor wanted to get Grandpa with the snow globe, but we landed on the lighthouse and then she fell. - Help. - Noor, give me your hand. Come on. Jules, I'm sorry. No, I'm the one that should say sorry. I shouldn't have excluded you. From now on, you can be Santa too. - But together, not by myself. - Together, with Grandpa and with me. I'm sorry. - Shall we go and get him? - Yes. Nice, right? We deserved this. How do you think Mr. Claus is doing? He's a big boy, he'll be fine. I'm sure he's less hot than us. Right now. Completely insane. Santa Claus. Santa Claus? Hello? Santa? Is Grandpa in that cell? Yes. - But we have to stay undetected, okay? - Okay. How will we ever get Grandpa out of here? I have a plan, but we first need to go to the North Pole quickly. - Do you have the snow globe? - Yes. Okay, great. Okay, let's go. Go ahead. Ready? - Ready. - Okay. Go. Silence. Shut up. - Grandpa. - Jules. - Noor. - Where's the key? - In the top drawer. - Go, get it. I knew it. I knew you would come and get me. - Come here. - Grandpa. - I knew it. - Guards. Shake it. Santa? We're going on a honeymoon, she said. Nice and relaxing, she said. No problem whatsoever, she said. - What's keeping them? - And what do you call that? Well, I call that a fluffy hurricane. Yes, fireworks with flower petals. Sugar on strawberries… Mr. Claus, they saved you. Finally. We were incredibly worried. And you've retrieved the snow globe. Just in time to deliver the presents. Felix. Felix is still up there. Not by yourself. Wait for me. - Felix, are you alright? - You. You locked me in here. - Felix. - Don't. - Don't do it. - Don't. - Don't do it, boy. - Felix. Wait. Help. - Help. - Felix. Help. - Felix, give me your hand. - The snow globe, I can almost reach it. - Felix, don't. - I need it to make the qualification. - Otherwise I'll never win. - Not important, we need to work together. You're way more important than that stupid qualification. Give me your hand. I can't hold on. I told you we would do everything together from now on. - Grandpa. - Noor. Thank God. Noël, come. Come here. Jezus, Noël, the storm. Where were you? - We were hiding in a cabin. - They have a jacket just like Santa. Noël, you'll never do this to me again. From now on, the kids have lunch with me. They're back. Yes, luckily. Goodbye. - Come. - Just a second, mommy. I'm sorry, Grandpa. I should've never let Felix see the snow globe. Now it's gone and you can never go back to the North Pole. And no one will get presents anymore. Jules was right, I would be the worst Santa ever. Why did you show Felix the snow globe? He wanted to see his parents and he was all alone. I just wanted to help him. Someone who always teased you? And that's exactly why you're the best Santa ever. Go to your mother now, she missed you. Jef said he's really sorry. For whatever he did. Maybe I overreacted a bit. You think so? What's wrong? I don't know. I can't get the marriage proposal together. And it seems like you two don't want to be here with us. Maybe it's too soon and we should just leave it as it is. No, no. Noor and I just had a little fight. - Really? - Yes. It's already been resolved. Who can stay angry at such a little one? I'm not little. Five years old, really. Why don't you propose to Jef tonight, at dinner? When everyone's there. Is that what you want? Yes. Dad would also like it if we were a family again. - I can't find the ring. - What? - How can that be? - No idea, I had it in the train. Okay, no problem. You can do without. No, but… It'll be fine. Just ask him. What's that? Yeah, otherwise it would never happen. Yes. Really? Of course. Wait. No. No, I mean, yes. Yes. - Your food will get cold. - Yeah. Hey, Noor. Are you going up the mountain by yourself tomorrow? And then smooth skiing to the bottom? I don't know if I can do that. You know what I think? I think you can do more than you think. - Sleep tight. - You too. Okay Felix, watch out for that turn. And you see that one? You need to… Hey, focus. - Come on, Noor. - No, wait. Come on, you can do it. Jef is right, you can do it. Are you insane? It's almost your turn to qualify. Sometimes it's not about winning, but about working together with your friends. Together? Together. Felix. Alright, Felix. Now you're a real winner. Sorry, Grandpa. I messed up. That's weird. - Noor said the exact same thing. - What? No, that's not true. I excluded her. That's why she went to Felix. All because I wanted to do it by myself. Now what? Without a snow globe we can't deliver packages. Yes… No… But… How? - We need to leave right away. - We? Aren't you forgetting someone? - Noor. - I have to go to my brother. And… thank you. And don't tell Felix this time. Look. - Ready to deliver packages, family Claus? - Yes, yes.
