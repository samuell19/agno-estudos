My name is Surya. The sunshine in my name is missing from my life since a year now. If there's any reason I feel remotely alive today after this one year of dark phase, It's only Vaishali. There's a deep affinity that Kolkata and this place in Nepal shares, both in terms of my love life and my future. We met here for the last time, exactly a year ago. This personal battle spanning 365 days i.e. 8760 hours and over one lakh minutes is finally coming to an end. We lose kingdoms in battles, but I'll lose the purpose in my life without Vaishali's return. This very thought can take my breath away. Hey... Hey..that's my bag. Hey... Come on, get down. Sir, please listen to me..please How do you think you can escape after smacking a cop? Take him into custody Sir, please..this is very important to me.. I've come all the way from India to Nepal just for this.. Oh, you're from India? Where do you stay there? Yes, I am from Kolkata. Oh, a Bengali I suppose! No sir, we're Telugu speaking Oh..Telugu.. Even my wife is Telugu speaking.. It was a love marriage.. a painful one.. Sir, I've been waiting for tomorrow since a year now.. Let me go. Regardless of the country where you beat up a cop, be it India or Nepal, it's still a big crime. You'll be put behind bars for at least three years now.. Hey Alok... -Yes sir File a chargesheet. -Okay sir. Sir, Why bother to file a chargesheet for this petty issue? Give me only one chance to meet Vaishali, you're free to do anything to me, I don't even mind being hanged. Is this a love story? -Yes sir I like love stories, please go on. I'll tell my story once I return..let me go. Hey... Either tell me your love story or stay behind bars for three years, the choice is yours Hey silence, can't you see I'm listening to a song. Hey, take this. Where can I find Surya? He'll rise within five minutes. Even the kid isn't scared of me, go hunt for him.. Surya deserves a smacking at any cost today. By the way, where's Darshi? He's yet to recover from the shock that Revathi gave him yesterday. Who's she? His sister, since yesterday. Come, take a seat. Didn't get it. He's asking you about Revathi, who's she? Listening to a Kishore Kumar song as I was getting drenched in the rains, I asked her out for a coffee.. What happened then? And then she addressed him as her brother. Hey...Surya. Surya.. Yes. Hey, give me the keys Why're you staring at me? Look, Surya's there, try beating him up. Go, beat him up Why're you looking at him? Go, beat him up Do we have any score to settle with this group? -These look like a new set of faces. Look at them! Hello.. Who the hell are you? -Milkha Singh.. What are you standing for..go, run! - At least inform me before you leave. Hey..come fast.. Looks like Surya is lucky today.. -Hey, Milkha Singh? Who the hell are you Milkha Singh? Mithun Chakraborty.. No..Pranab Mukherjee. Mukherjee's... Phone. Hello... Boss, we caught Surya. What should we do. This isn't Surya.. This isn't the Surya that we want. What? It's a misunderstanding.. a confusion.. Do you kill people even as you're confused? A small confusion.. Because of a small confusion you're gonna beat me up. What's this spate of violence for, you haven't even thought about it, Violence is Impurity. put an end to all forms of violence. Have I walked on the same land as yours all these days? I feel like freezing the world this moment. My past didn't let me unite with you I feel like waging a battle against time. I've taken a leap of faith today Is this freedom? You've broken my shackles unknowingly. It's the first revolt for my heart of preserving me from you. I am freed from a prison-like loneliness. To your heart that never acknowledged my presence. Here I come to win it over Put an end to my loneliness With a mere glance I'll even dedicate my next birth to you Come, conquer my kingdom. Even though I'm a part of your silence. I'm transforming into the God (Shiva) that shields you from the venom. (Indistinct Voices..) Hey, where are you going? (Indistinct Voices..) Hey, go back. Due to sake of you people traffic is getting stuck. Silence. What happened...? Due to sake of them... we are getting late for our Programme. What's up with you dude? Grandma..grandma.. What is it, my dear? Where's sister Vaishali? She'll be here soon Hey..you've come at last. Dad.. -Yes Is there something that you want to tell me about? I don't think so.. By the way, your sister had just called.. They're planning to shift your niece to the US apparently.. What much can we say? You know I'm not talking about that What is it then? Weren't you drunk the previous night? It was only a single peg.. I swear. Trust me, only a single peg Okay, just a couple of pegs, why don't you call Gokhle uncle to confirm? Dad, you're a magistrate.. Falsehood doesn't augur well for you.. This is the last time. Vaishali -Yes, mom Hey..don't tell her about it! She'll create unnecessary drama now. Vaishali Let's see. Hey, you've climbed a pole? What's gotten into you? The girl has made me crazy.. The craziness does have a name called Vaishali.. She won't fall for you I don't mind dying at her feet then Is it? She'll even suggest you a way to die, she'll definitely like people who'll die for her What if I tell that I'll kill her. Hey..are you in love or are you setting up a land deal? We haven't even told you much about her.. She's like the English teacher for a Telugu medium student. She won't bother to hear us.. while we can't comprehend her words either. Then how do I make her fall for me? Oh..what a question? This is the answer that the humankind has been hunting for since centuries without much success. continue to try. What if she could rescue me? I don't get it.. We will catch a cold if we get drenched. You'll also be panting for breath as you run.. Guys, go smack that idiot! ( Indistinct voices...) Please save me, someone, I need help, Please save me! Please save me... (Indistinct Voices...) Please save me! Please save me! Catch this Goons. Don't spare him.,beat him to a pulp.. what are you running for, stop, you idiot! How many streets you will roam like this. Please help me someone.. Is there anyone around to rescue me? Wasn't he here sometime ago? Go find him, he wouldn't have run far..there he is Find him. Please don't shout. They're a group of ten.. And I'm alone and I won't be spared. Could you help me for once please? I'll take this off when you stop shouting. Oh..you? What..? You'd just promised me you wouldn't shout. They're a big bunch and they'll beat me to death. Please save me. Did you spot anyone on the run here? That way. He's gone that way, don't spare him guys! What's happening...? didn't you find any other place to make romance. Think he got caught up..let's move You'd promised you would not shout. These are the goons.... Smack them hard! Very thanks for saving me It's okay, why did you act as if you were so familiar to me before? I don't remember seeing you anytime. You may not know me, but I've known you since two years now How's that? I've been in love with you since two years What? I mean I've been following you since two years. you won't even get it..don't try asking me a reason. I get it, but I just don't care. Exactly..You haven't even noticed that I've been following you. I don't understand why's he chasing me either. He was about to kill me. luckily, If not for you... I wouldn't have been alive What are you talking about? Why should someone else feel bad that you're behind me? Who's he? How would I know? There are over hundreds like me who're going crazy about you. How do I pinpoint one person? What's wrong in admiring you from a certain distance? As long as you don't irritate me, I don't even care. I've been loving you since two years now Vaishu. Have I done anything..well..to irritate you? Don't dare call me Vaishu, It's only the near and dear who call me that way! My name is Surya. you don't have any choice but to call me that way! The senior citizens nearly ripped me apart. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been alive. Damn..I've missed. Coin, dude. You can't even hit the right target within this close distance and daydream of making Vaishali fall for you. and the girl doesn't even care two hoots for you even as you stand beside her.. She doesn't even respond to people Not even if they plead to her. Anyone would talk about the person who stands beside them. it's about making an impact even in one's absence. If I'm not wrong, the girl should already be discussing about me by now. It was your fault, it was your fault, but it was your fault that road was bad, and it was such huge hill and this happened, that happened. They're talking about everything except your matter. are they even doctors? I only hear adult jokes. The dirty talk that we have during our drinks is of no match to this. I'm being honest.. Like that quote where we talk about how the stains wouldn't perish despite repeated attempts. she isn't a girl who'll fall for you. I'd advise you to give up on her No. Destiny may not favour us every time.. It happens... but we need to make sure, it does so soon Hello Shailu... coming. A mild breeze invites a large wave That completely conceals me as it arrives. A heavenly beauty from a dream boards a train. To wander on the earth. The air starts talking The earth waters my feet The rain holds an umbrella, as you arrive I'm not in a hurry to meet you I don’t intend to leave until I make my dream a reality.. The time too fades away in your presence. The world has transformed all of a sudden The sky and the earth have united in my heart I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara. The world has transformed all of a sudden The sky and the earth have united in my heart I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara. I've written secretive letters Those are full of gestures and not alphabets. I've foreseen a future. Hey Vaishu.. Hi, how are you? -I'm fine. It's so nice to see you. -It's been a longtime indeed You've become so chubby What chubby, I've put on weight I know! You can't escape, come home now He didn't stop. He will stop. What the hell is this man? What are you thinking about yourself? You won't even offer a lift to a boy if he asks so, but for a girl, you do so even without asking? What are you talking about? He's disappointed because you offered to drop Vaishali to her home yesterday. Vaishali has been my neighbour for years, we're classmates in school and college He doesn't intend to spare you if he spots you with her next time. I get it. Alike smoking and drinking, I've now realised offering a ride to my neighbour is also injurious to health. Bat well, don't get runout Sure sir.. My eyes haven't spotted anything like this in the past So much that my eyebrows refuse to be shut. It seems like my heart would stop beating Drowning in this wave of beauty The storm hasn't moved past the edge of the umbrella You're the lava flowing in the heart A river, that's nowhere to be seen, is overflowing And it has merged with the seas as it met you. The world has transformed all of a sudden The sky and the earth have united in my heart I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara... The world has transformed all of a sudden The sky and the earth have united in my heart I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara... Hey..listen..Get up.. are you following me? Didn't I tell you about it yesterday? It's not fair on your part to talk to me in such close proximity.. What if he sees me? Who will see you? Who knows? May be your lover in exile. He created a ruckus even as I merely looked at you. What if he sees us conversing like this? When I prefer loving you from a certain distance, why do you intimidate me like this? Why don't you simply get it? Mr Surya... Mr Surya... Mr Surya... Yes. You aren't even leaving me here? What if he notices me in your company and kills me? I should consider myself lucky that he isn't here. Could you please talk in a language that I could understand. He has spotted us conversing. And then? He threatened to kill me if I loved..I mean..followed you.. Even a doctor wouldn't have known if an X-Ray could come to use in so many ways.. You're awesome! Being such a scarecrow, you should've told him you aren't in love with me.. I've made that mistake too. I've lied to him.. That I'm not in love with you But he didn't believe me. - Why...? I'd asked him the same thing. He'd told me that my words belied the truth in my eyes. Biscuit... -Idiot. Do you really see my love for you through these eyes? Yes..Yes..I see something. If he loves me so much, why's he chasing you and not me? He's scared. He's worried if you would reject him. He's worried if you would fall for me sometime. He's worried. How could you come up with such stuff in no time? All to satiate my hunger..what else can I do? Morning sir.. -Please sit. Hey Gokhle.. Hey, why did you ask me to come down suddenly? Sir.. I am also one among the crores residing in Kolkata.. Thanks for letting me be anonymous. Gokhle, the point I'm making is that a hardcore criminal like Dhanraj Pillai... who's reportedly committed over 40 murders is now seeking an MLA ticket and worse, there are several regional parties keen to give him that opportunity? Are you listening...? Yes. What's the point of being alive when I can't even question this?. I really hope you realise this an insult to this democracy and take some serious action and not let this happen. yours truly, an anonymous citizen. Hey..what are you doing to your hair? I'm washing my hair with a shampoo after applying oil. Boss is becoming a small kid day by day. Where did you go till now...? What's the matter? What happened? The cops are coming.. Who's so gutsy to come here? The magistrate Prakash is now in their control. Bribe him with any amount that he quotes.. It's tough, I meant, he doesn't stand by anything but justice.. Hello brother.. This Friday, the tenth day in the Telugu calendar. Yes..apparently, it's an auspicious day.. and also, the inauspicious hour is about to end in ten minutes. and I'm planning to kill you all. If you have any hopes of staying alive,we have option for that too.. If my boss comes out with in ten minutes you can reach your home safely. Are you thinking that anyone might come to save you. No way.. no one is around. Magistrate..Prakash. Yes, I saw you on the TV yesterday sir.. Wasn't it you who put Dhanraj behind bars?.. That was good riddance sir. You truly deserve all the praise..Let's talk over a cup of coffee. I don't like if someone places their hand on my shoulder. I fear my hand wouldn't be in my control then. Sir, please join me.. Who's he? he broke his hand something like it's a sugarcane. I think he is his fan. I'll kill him right after this cup of tea. You were calling it an inauspicious hour then, and now you talk of killing him after a cup of tea. Do you have any intention to kill him at all? Somanna would put his head down in shame if we threaten that boy now.. Do we have any scores to settle? How is it even possible? We'd just met.. Look at how he's staring at me with a rage in his eyes. Why? Don't you like it? No..someone please tell him to not look at me that way. Oh no... Look at the way he's beating them up. this is a behaviour of someone who deserves to be jailed.. Think you got it totally wrong here. keep going, I'll come soon -Where? Wasn't it you who talked about criminals being jailed? I am on it..please proceed.. Hello... -You b.... Oh man, relax. I don't know you, where you'd come from. but you have been a God-sent saviour for me today, your father must really be proud of you.. Padma, what's your problem in signing the divorce papers? Padma... Surya.. go and play outside. Why are asking me for a divorce Vivek? I just don't like this.. You, Surya and this family are roadblocks to my ambitions.. I am not able to handle this. What have we done to earn your wrath? Forget me, what wrong has the little one (Surya) done to you? Wasn't it you who insisted on this marriage? I'd always asked you to think twice before marrying me, didn't I tell you that marriage isn't merely about staying together... and that it needs two individuals who can't live without one another? What did you say then Vivek? Vivek.. I am asking you. -Don't shout. I'd liked you then and I felt it was right then.. I don't like it now, what's your problem? Just sign those divorce papers. - I won't. Surya needs a father at this age. - I don't feel it's necessary, I merely introduced him to this world as my son. Why should I protect him? What kind of shit is this Padma? What should I understand? And why should I? I am least concerned, I just don't care. Mom... Mom... Mom... Surya. -Mom... Mom, I don't need a dad. I don't need him mom. Even I don't need him. my son..that's why I'd sent him off. I'm there for you.. Why are getting wet outside? Come in. Mom, did you ever miss dad? What's your point in discussing it now? Get in.. Why don't you tell me? Once in a while, yes Maybe you should've left me, you would've been happy at least. Cut that crap.. Honestly..I wan't you to turn a child again. I wish I could carry you in my arms and relive those times all over again. (Song Humming in background..) I'll repeat my number, please note it down. It's an art to make a girl fall for me without her knowledge. Correct, Anything that you do subconsciously is a piece of fine art that comes to you by birth. You are? I am Gemini Natarajan sir..I'm an Oracle developer.. I think we've met before. -This face? No chance at all I don't like if someone places their hands on my shoulder. - Same here.! Oh, were you talking about yourself! Please take a seat.. Hello... You'd told me your number, but your name is..? Vaishali Cherukuri..How many times do you ask me the same question? Hello... You've told me your name, why don't you tell me a place and a time to meet as well? We've interesting unlimited night packages for young and beautiful doctors like you. You can call us so many times. Hi... Provided you say yes.. or you can say no as well, but if you try to act smart in front of many people, I'll catch hold of you at place where there's no network at all.. Hey, Gemini.. I remembered where I saw you? - No chance.. where? At the police station..I'm sure.. Impossible, I didn't even go to the cops when I lost my laptop. Oh, why are you here...? I'm lucky to be alive because this was a running train, imagine my plight otherwise? What do you say Gemini? -No chance. Hello..Shailu, a group of goons are creating a ruckus here. Are they even aware of what they're talking. We should just kill them right there. these idiots should be hanged till death.. You think you can whack those goons and make the girl fall for your heroics? No chance at all. I will see you soon..ha ha ha Next stop.. Looks like he'll get down from a running train. -Hey..stay there, I'm coming She has left, you've no chance to show your heroics. That's perfect.. That's what I meant too. Why are you staring at me that way? Call me if you want any night packages.. No chance at all! Hey..why did you whack me so hard..are you crazy? what's this? Why are you beating me up? Gods reside at that place where the women are respected..(in Sanskrit) Why are you speaking in Kannada language when I asked you something? I'll beat you up till you make sense of those words. Hey...sense it -Hey.. who's he? Get up... Did you get to know at least ? -No, brother! Find it out.. Oh my...Someone please rescue me... Do you want to know you about fashion? Here you go..What do you think of yourself? I think I finally remember.. I remembered our first encounter as you hit him, we had met at a police station previously.. How dare you tease women? Your wallet.. Weren't you telling something. -It's your wallet sir. Did I drop it somewhere? -No sir.. I stole the wallet at the time when we were discussing about the art of making the girl fall for you subconsciously. How could you notice it? Have you finally learnt your lesson? Would you dare tease women ever again? Oh my..Oh my.. I beg you..please tell me sense of that. -I don't know... you go from here. Did you get it? Got it sir..I won't ever do it in my life.. Why don't you tell me what's this all about? He's ripping me apart here. Oh, was this for you? I thought it was directed at me. Please sir... no... - I have a small doubt.. What's that? Any guy would try to show his heroics in front of a girl.. Which girl? -Get lost. sir, why did you start this only after she'd left? I was with the girl then. -Yes Didn't someone else beat up these guys? I thought you'd done it. Yes, I was the one to beat them up. but that guy was different who was with her. If the other guy was with the girl... why did I steal his wallet? Step aside. -It's better if you realise it now. I won't..you're free to do whatever you want, you wastrel! Aren't both guys the same? Only you and I know this.. Then what about Madam. So there's no chance that she would realise this. Why isn't this shutting. my bloody fate..Why did I even go overboard with my talk?. Oh God. Looks like he'll kill me here.. Anyone who gets this, please bother to explain. The Gods reside at a place where women are respected (in Telugu) Did you get it? -Oh yes..sir Sister. Sister. What are these blows? He'd hit me so hard that I even remembered my previous birth. I'd then realised that you were my sister in my previous birth. and I had got you married without your approval, for which I am leading the life of a fool this birth, Please help me. please free me off my sins by tying this raakhi. He'd hit you all just because you had teased me. Who's he? Don't you know him either? Actually, no.. I've only heard about him but didn't get to see him. Lordess Rukmini..She hadn't even met Lord Krishna. It's all thanks to Narada's enriching descriptions of his personality and his uniqueness that made Rukmini an ardent admirer of Krishna. Oh my Lord (Krishna) What are you upto? Why can't I see you? I've always listened to you I'm patiently waiting for you Why don't you put an end to this illusion? Destroying the demons Winning me over... You've played a lot of games Why can't you come down to meet me? Oh my lovely girl, why do you want me to come? Oh my lovely girl, what do you wish to say? Oh my lovely girl, I understand your pain Oh my lovely girl, I'm here to conquer... Oh my lovely girl, I was just playfully teasing you..Oh my love.. Oh Lord, the jewel of the Yadava kingdom The destroyer of the demoness Puthana. In the deep waters of river Yamuna You've destroyed the venomous serpent Kaliya You've helped many kings attain salvation. Why don't you grace us with your beautiful avatar? I've thought about you, Dreamt about you, Oh Lord, please grace us! Hey, the lord of several Gopikas, Hey Krishna, the giver of freedom. Oh my lovely girl, why do you want me to come? Oh my lovely girl, I was just playfully teasing you..Oh my love.. Oh my lovely girl, Oh my lovely girl. Where's your helmet? -It was too heavy on the head.. Show me your license then? I've left it at home.. File a chalan of Rs.500, he isn't wearing a helmet. Let me go.. -take that bike keys. Let me go..I don't have any cash with me..I really don't! Surya... Hi... I need to talk to you, can we talk over a cup of coffee? The invisible man who'd chased you.. do you at least know his name? The man who beats me up wouldn't tell me his name right? I don't know The same guy who ripped apart those idiotic goons on the train. Is it? -Yes.. That's my fear too... What if he sees us conversing like this? I am already scared for my life! But it's exciting, isn't it. You know what I'm beginning to like his madness. Even Rukmini had only heard about Lord Krishna and fell for him. From the time you and the other guys spoke to me about him. I am not able to get him out of my head, he is in my dreams, he is everywhere and I am like. I am not able to bear this. No idiot in this world should ideally face such a situation. Masking his true identity and acting like another person isn't any cakewalk. I can't..you know. Hi Mannav... -Hi. How does he look?..How tall is he? Guess he's as tall as me. Is his skin tone similar to yours too? Yes..but how did you know? Mannav... There's a guy wearing a green shirt behind you. He's getting extremely irritated as we're striking a conversation. Don't get scared. I'm here for you..My gut says that he's the guy. Could you confirm me if he's the same man. Please. isn't he? Right..! Right..! He's not. I guess you're upset..I didn't mean that. Who am I to get upset? After all whom am I? Yes, all whom am I? You're anyways a Rukmini And he's Lord Krishna? Then who am I? Maybe Krishna's cousin Sishupala? At least for the time being.. Then..I guess my end is in the hands of Lord Krishna? I understand your fears.. Damn... You're scared if he would kill you for following me..right? I think I have a solution.. What's that..? I'll tie you a rakhi and call you my brother... he wouldn't bother you anytime again. What say...? Hey...What are you talking? Don't take foolish decisions, it's my job to unite you both. I'll call you when he's about to beat me up.. you can leave. Promise?..Thank you. It should happen to you. You're a fraudster. you've no option but to fall at Vaishali's feet and tell the truth.. there's no other way around. there's no other way around. I nearly went to Vaishali's college to reveal the truth. but, this guy Shravan turned my plans tipsy-topsy. Who's this Shravan now, where he did he come from? You only told that... he'd come from an unexpected direction.. Hey..Where is she? She's inside. Vaishali is inside the lab.. -you wait.. Vaishali..I've been sincerely loving you since two years and you've always said no. Why..? I don't even have a chance to propose in the future.. I am leaving for New Zealand. Why you are being so weird? You continue to ask the same question despite knowing the answer..It's always a no. That's what I am asking you, why? Actually, it's none of your business. But still if you're curious, I've someone in my life now. Yes, I heard you're seeing someone named Surya! Oh..you imagined it that way! Hello Vaishu. -Surya. Did you get to know anything about him? I'm here for the same reason. By the way, why are you here? I've come here to tell the truth. I'm not sure how would you react to it. Tell me, it's okay How would you react if you know that Lord Krishna and Sisupala is none but the same guy in this love story? What do you mean? You're angry.. I could sense it..I was asked to lie to you. do they even deserve to be my friends? Oh, a lie. How mad would I be to tell you that I'm both Lord Krishna and Sishupala. There's no chance for that at all. We can't be the same. You were lying at me even for a petty anger. Imagine my plight when you repeatedly tell me you love that guy? Wouldn't I be jealous? tell me. What happened Shravan? Come. I don't know about you, but it looks like the other guy is jealous seeing us converse regularly. Who is he? He'd just left..a senior named Shravan. he'd dated my friend Latha for two years.. and the girl nearly committed suicide. He's now chasing me..these guys should be killed. But I'll be fine I think, he'll be in New Zealand tomorrow and my problem should more or less be resolved. It's a relief for me as well. Hello Your secret admirer has nearly killed me. You could see me alive if you come soon. Hope you'll come? Oh my god, he's found the guy it seems. Where should I come? Come down to Ballygunge football ground quickly. Hi Bro... Bro.. Who are these guys? They're friends. What's happening here? Do you want an answer or want to beat them up? Hey, take this. Hey... Hey, stop you... please.. Don't beat me.. Don't beat me..please. Don't beat me..please. Please.. Please.. Please.. beat me up. Hey..don't hit me. Hit him.. please. Beat him -He's finally smacked me. Hey..don't hit me. Oh God..! he is killing me. Shravan..? He didn't get hurt. Smack him in a such a way that he doesn't get hurt. smack him.. Oh my..he's whacking me.. he's ripping me apart.. Oh my.. He's here alone.and you guys are beating him up as a group. Are you shameless? Are you shameless? Glad I'd just come in the nick of time. -Yes Vaishu. Hey..What's the fight all about? -It's nothing.. Why have you all come together as a group then? -Bye, Shravan Oh no... Why did you have a quarrel with them now Vaishu? I'd already told you yesterday about my friend.. Latha, he was the guy I was referring to. If he's loving me... and following me, what's your problem? Did I ever tell you that I'm in love with you? Why don't you reply? What's your problem when Vaishu's loving me? Why don't you reply...? No problem brother. I've a flight to catch, I'll get going. What's this Vaishu? He and you both don't have an issue if I love you. I too don't have any issue. How wonderful would it be for us to love each other. Vaishu..Vaishu..Imagine my plight if you say no to my proposal? Seriously, what will be your plight? Should I lie or tell the truth? First tell the lie. I'll go mad. The truth? I never lie Vaishu.. Vaishu... Hey..It's okay as long as you follow me. aren't you stretching things far when you say you'd go mad without me? Even I..had opined the same..Actually Hello... Hello... Hello Vaishu.. Today we will discuss about Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor. Surya... Hello..I know you wouldn't lie to me. It's a quality that I like.. You think I could consider your proposal? Yes..without any hesitation whatsoever. Hello... Hey..I'd forgotten about it last time around. Why do you think I should like you? I mean, what's so special about you? I belong to ABO blood group. Very rare blood group. Only one in about a crore would possess it. do you need any more reasons? Isn't this funny? Vaishu..is there something that you want to tell me about? Do you remember me asking about the exam to secure an admission for a course in cardiology in London? We have exam on that in the next week. I expected something more important. Oh yes..I nearly forgot about this.. I'm beginning to like a guy off late. Is it? It does sound interesting. Who's he? ..What does he do?.. Where does he stay? Too many questions dad.. They were only three of them..the questions I don't know. I'll call him over for lunch tomorrow, why don't you directly ask him? Dad... -Yes. Only you can convince mom. Oh my..I can't do that..No Dad please..please..please.. Let's see. Thank you.. Hey..defend the ball..the ball Hey.. -Hey..tell me Vaishu.. Why are you so scared of Shravan? Some more guts would have suited your personality. I don't know how would you survive in the future, if left alone like this. Aren't you there for me? You're telling me everything but for the reason you called me for... Tell me once and I'll stick to your word and be as loyal as your dog. You're coming to my house for lunch tomorrow at sharp 1 pm. Dad doesn't tolerate those who aren't punctual. Where's the house with the number 7-50-54? Vaishali's house right? What's this hubbub for? Is anyone coming? Don't ask me anything. apparently, a special guest is due to arrive. Did he tell you anything about the guest? Not quite..As usual, I can't comprehend most of your dad's words. Hey driver..stop the vehicle.. just a minute. Stop it..did you recognise me? Sir, it's you. Thank God, you've recognised me I've come here to meet a friend In our colony? This is my house, why don't you come over for a cup of coffee? -Sir, I don't think this is necessary. Just a cup of coffee -I'll have coffee some other time. You don't stand a chance, you can meet your friend anytime. I'm alive today only because of you! My wife wouldn't spare me if I don't invite a God-sent messenger like you to our house. Sir, no, Sir. -It's an order. Please give me a minute sir. Where are you Surya? Dad's about to arrive, please come quickly. Dad's about to arrive, please come quickly.. Let me convince her, give the mobile to me.. -I'm coming in a minute.. I hope you're coming. -Yes..I am. Don't cheat me, this is an order. Hey dad..looks like he's arrived. Come. Do you know who's here. Who...? I can't recollect..sorry Is he the one who rescued you from that bunch of goons? Yes..that's true. Hello Surya..Where are you..Dad has already reached. I'm in the middle of a prayer.. I'll be there in five minutes. See girl, you may not know me, but he'll take at least half an hour to reach you. Half an hour? Hello...Hello... idiot. Come..come.. my boy. Please make yourself comfortable.. I'll be back in a jiffy. So, this is my wall of fame. Hello... It's with you. Let me start with my Law college days. Ofcourse...they are my certificates of verification. Oh wow! And you know what? I used to like playing the piano. And I must confess I was addicted to the instrument. Trust me. What? This is? This is? The girl on the right is my elder daughter, she now stays in the US. And the girl on the left? -The younger daughter..she's here. I think I must leave. Hey..where are you going? No sir..I think I'll come sometime later. Just that you've come..meet her and go. I'll be in serious trouble sir.. Let's call the emergency if that's necessary, now come over. No sir.. There she arrives. My daughter Vaishu.. Oh..How true are Lord Krishna's words? What is it? That karma is a bitch. Hello..this is Vaishali, the girl who stood left in that frame and you should know him, he's a gem of a boy, he's a very. Let me complete my sentence, that day when the goons created a ruckus, he. -Leave it sir, it's fine. Can I decide that please? He's that very God-sent messenger who rescued me from the goons that day. weren't you there that day to notice it? Only now, I've realised that we can kill people with flattery too. I think I shouldn't have saved you that day. It's rare to find a guy like you these days. could you come here once please? Don't know What's her problem. You speak to him. I'll manage that. Thank you. I've been trying to tell this to you for long now. Don't get confused. My dad has devised a plan to convince my mom. That you were the guy to have saved my father from the goons. Ok, it's fine... you also managed it well. What do you mean he's devised a plan? Why would he lie? It's a mistake. Anyways,how could your family lie so spotaneously? Damn...How? how's this possible? Why did you call me..? Isn't the guy apt for our girl? Why don't you ask about his caste? I won't get a great chance to manage her. What do you mean? About Vaishu's marriage, is it? Is it enough if you like him? Wouldn't I have a say too? Are you the one to marry him.. it's only Vaishu who needs to like him. You were about to say something..Vaishu? Now? Shall we talk about it tomorrow? Vaishu.. -Oh dad. Vaishu, give me a high five. I've somehow managed to convince your mom. Is it? Where's the boy..? He's here..right here. I'll be in a soup now for sure. Hey..you.. Oh he's seen me. yes, sir.. Poor girl, I wasn't talking about this gentleman. This is about Surya, it's already 1:30 pm, where is he looks like, he doesn't have any punctuality. Tell him I don't like it. call him. Son, I'm really sorry, I kept you waiting, I suppose you had to meet someone, please get going. I'd never forget how you'd helped me that day, would I be alive today without you? I wouldn't have even existed. Decided...I should repay your generosity in some form. Sir, you've already done a lot for me. you're not realising it. I'll make a move sir. Okay bye. Vaishu..please send him off. go. What's the time... why don't you tell Surya it's 1:30 pm already? Over ten people were chasing you..you got scared. -Vaishu... You made me a fool..nothing of it is true. I should blame myself for swooning over a guy like you. You'd told me to come down. and now, you're sending me off even without having a proper conversation. why don't you talk it out? I hate you. When did you even love me to say 'I hate you' all of a sudden? Hello sir. I've come here only with Vaishali's insistence. Get lost. Good afternoon and salutations ladies and gentlemen. I've come here to present you something special, Viewers and friends...keep your eyes glued and here we present, Dil Se... Hello..doctor, please rescue him.. he's had a heart attack..please.. What's the matter? With all heart.. With all heart... As I started from home. I had a heart attack. It was already late and the heart is fuming..with all heart.. With all heart.. With all heart... So please take care of your tiny hearts. Other than smoking, drinking and other food habits. Betrayal... being cheated on.. lying... can also cause heart failure. Though it's to the left is always right, Okay Any doubts? Yes. Side please. I hope everyone present in this show is a heart surgeon. I mean you're all heart surgeons, right. There's a problem with my heart. I think the rhythm is missing at times and my heart beats at a fast pace. Some times..it also beats slowly. This condition is called Heart Arrhythmia Is it dangerous? Of course it is..How long have you been facing it?. Well..I think Jan 18, 2014, ever since I met Vaishu Oh Vaishu..congratulations. My heart has lost its control..Is it because of you? It threatens to come to a halt without a yes from you. Could you do something to cure it, won't it be an insult for the medicos for me to die of a heart attack here? Isn't it..? -Yes.. Yes.. Vaishu.. The heart is a child, it is a novice.. The heart is a child, it is a novice I know I wasn't right. But it was for whom?..Wasn't it for you? Being a madcap girl that you've always been, why would you even care for me? Hey, Wow... Vaishu... you look so beautiful when you're angry.. Wow.... I wanted to do this in a public place though I know it's wrong.. What else can I do?. Vaishu... Vaishu... Vaishu... Vaishu... Vaishu... Hey...Here. Go, take a step forward My lips are on the move In many different ways Even as the heart says no... The heart is experiencing a rare weariness... Yet the lips crave for companionship. The gloom disappears as the lips unite I nearly lose my life and yet recover again The heart that rises after many a fall... Even during a calamity The heart seeks an acquaintance with the calamity Don't you know this is all about you? Oh my love, isn't this strange? Your warm hug doesn't let me experience the chills When you're prisoned by me, Aren't winters a season of warmth too? Even a raindrop undertakes a penance to reach your skin The spring season arrives in your footsteps You've hurled at me Words like a snare Here begins my journey The heart that rises after many a fall... Even during a calamity The heart seeks an acquaintance with the calamity Don't you know this is all about you? That one year went by like a breeze.. The story is beautiful indeed.. But I don't get what's the connection between Kolkata and a place that's 800 km away from the city (Kathmandu) The actual story is just about to begin.. Today we will talk about different types of Amnesia. anterograde, retrograde, postromatic... transient global people with this syndrome may present with widely wearing degree of forgetfulness we see a combination of... Vaishali? Yes sir.. Can you tell what is retrograde amnesia? The loss of memory access to events or information... that was learnt before the accident or the particular injury or the onset of the disease and. Yes..What do you want? -Vaishali. Oh..I am dead meat! Why are you here..? Baby... see you soon.. Hey... help me. You've finally come baby.. Yet again..do you plan to hug me publicly? What do you think of yourself? I mean..it's been two days since we met. I didn't believe writer Devulapalli when he'd said that every second minus the love of their lives feels like another thousand years.. Leave me now... - I'm forced to believe him now. You're acting too weird when we don't meet for even two days. Now I'm leaving for Nepal for a week's trip. How would you manage without me? Nepal? Poor boy..Why don't you ask the same writer for an advise? Okay, leave then. -Surya..stop. Hey... Is it necessary for you to leave for Nepal..? I'd told you more than a hundred times now that it's for a medical camp.. You look really cute today. What If I need it again...? Why don't you come to Nepal? That won't be right. Oh no..Dad. Oh my demoness. How many more days should I wait for? Sailu..We have checked this witness..okay.. Vaishu... -What...? Why are you here.? You'd only told me to come whenever I may... Kiss me now.. Why does your professor seem jealous looking at us together?. Wait at the coffee shop, I'll be there in a while.. I won't. -I'll come. I can't wait. Give me two minutes. -I just can't wait. Hopeless.. Come soon. Hey..sor... Are you shameless? Don't you even have common sense to say sorry? Culture less fellow. What you said..? You'd called me culture less? I don't have anyone to teach me culture. What do I do? Hey Surya, what has gotten into you?..what are you doing?. Sir, you're the author Vivek Ravipati. Surya, do you even know who he is? I am so sorry about his behaviour. -It's Okay. I am a big fan of your work..I regularly read all your books. Thank you so much. but I am sorry for everything that has happened. What, are you still angry? Look at them, how happy are they? That idiot doesn't know that his life would be an empty book in the future. What do you mean? Won't we be happy if we get married? Come, let's get married now.. I'll see how your life changes for the worse. I will stick here. Marriage? What are you talking? Hey, wait. You don't seem to be in a good mood today. let's talk about this tomorrow. what do you feel? Aren't we happy like this? Why do we need to get married? We're happy now right. We're happy, yes but I'm greedy. I want to be much more happier..I need more of this. I need more of this. -Then we should never get married. provided you want us to be happier. Stop joking Surya. Do you mean that we would forever be together and yet not get married? I think so... Surya... Surya, wait. I'm not against live-in relationships but I am uncomfortable about it. What's wrong. Oh... correct. Marrying you and making a claim that you're mine works for me. But why do we need the permission of the society to stay together? Tell me, what's your issue with marriages? The very idea of marriage itself. Do you notice how many couples are happy after getting married? Nothing. Every one is acting that they are happy. What are you talking Surya? Won't we stay happy if we get married?. Why will people stay together in a marriage even when they aren't happy? Compromise. No marriage would survive if the couple doesn't agree upon a few compromises and adjustments. Why are you talking of getting married when I'm saying we're happy this way? Don't irritate me with your talk on marriage. I'm trying hard. but I'm just not able to understand you as a person. Hey... Why don't you get this? Even my parents loved each other and got married. Out of the blues, My dad remembered about his career and left mom. Infront of mine. Why didn't the very concept of marriage keep them together then? That's why one shouldn't get married if the two plan to stay together all their lives...Vaishu we should only marry when we can't live without each other. My dad didn't quite feel that and even I frankly don't feel it with you today. Is there any assurance that you'd also not say this in this future? You can't. This one reason tells us why we shouldn't marry. To behave like my dad... understood. I'm really trying to understand you Surya..but.. How should I explain you then? I was mad to not understand this before. A distance between us, has grown apart more than ever before. This isn't working out.. let's break up Vaishu. Wait Surya. listen to me once. Do you even realise the outcome of your words? Why should we break up at the very thought that we won't stay together in the future? This is blasphemy, why don't you understand? How..? You're not understanding my intentions and I'm not convinced by yours either. Let's stop this here. We'll repent about this decision, maybe for days, months or a year at best. we'll get used to it later. You're right Surya. We should marry only when we can't live without each other. To realise it, we need to break up. I'm leaving for Europe next month..To do my PG course. We'll live in different countries, won't communicate through calls, no messages... and we won't be a couple, as you'd intended us to be. If either of us feel the need to revive this relationship, let's meet in this very location next year. Just give it a thought, I'll be waiting for you. And if you won't? It would've been a year without each other, we'll get used to being alone. It took a year's time and a 800 km journey to Nepal to realise my deep-rooted love for Vaishali. No girl would bother to return to you after that conversation. that too a doctor, I don't see any hope.. She willn't come. Please don't say that.. I've almost prepared to kill myself in case she doesn't come. I might not even think twice in killing you if you utter those words again. please don't let me do that sir. You'll smack me? You've cracked a very good joke. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir, be careful., are you fine now? Sir... What were you telling a few minutes before? Were you telling she wouldn't return again? She won't come... -Thank you sir..thanks.. She wouldn't have come for sure.. -Thank you sir.. Dad look at these pigeons. Wait Surya, I need more, more than this You aren’t understanding me I’m not going to be convinced by you. It isn’t going to work out, let us break up Vaishu Dad... Dad... Dad... Dad... Dad... Surya... Surya... Surya... Just because your dream is headed here, Just because this appears your destination. Don't tread this path, my love! Just because your dream is headed here, Just because this appears your destination. Don't tread this path, my love! Would you want to be enveloped by darkness all around? Would you want your heart to be stranded in the middle of a forest? Oh my beloved trust! Don't try to stick to your words! We've a wealth of memories together! Oh my rosy past! As a temple on the verge of ruin, Should I welcome you? Despite realising this isn't an ideal time, should I take a step ahead? Should I ask you how long would this pangs of separation be? Surya... Surya... Surya... Around 1900 die in earth quake in Nepal, thousand stuck in the rubble Surya, don’t touch She is coming to India after a year, instead of coming home straight. Get up. She goes to meet a friend, he nods in approval. None in the family have the common sense to inform me. She too doesn’t have the sense to call me over the phone. What is Ingitham (common sense)? -You shut up Did Vaishali call? Don’t make me talk Have you taken a vow not to talk? Settle the marriage discussion as soon she comes Didn’t you tell it is her wedding and it is her wish? I regret saying that, okay? We got the eldest one married to your side of the family, now get Vaishali married to Venkatrao’s son. My nephew is coming from America next month. Who that Chatur Ramalinga? She will never marry. Take my word. Hey... Sir... Please help me, I need to call Vaishali come with me. Hello... I am Surya, Is Vaishali there? We were just discussing about her marriage with my nephew next spring, you understand? Vaishali agreed? Vaishali need to agree right? Why won’t she....the boy is a doctor plus he is from America Hello... Hey you come here, bring him here Sir..Vaishali hasn’t come. She hasn’t come... Yes. A second back I was very happy when I learnt she hasn’t come. Even if she had come what would have happened? At the most we would have died. I am getting angry and hurt at the same time after having learnt of her marriage. Hey Surya, listen Surya... Surya... Need doctors..need doctors Yeah I am fine... I am bleeding a bit. But it's fine. I am serious along. That's Okay. Can I please make an emergency call... -Yeah sure.. but please make it fast. Hello... Hello Surya... -Vaishu, how are you? Where are you? At home. Just going out with Padma. Anything important? By the way how did you think of us suddenly? Called just to know if you are safe I’m safe. The earthquake took place in Kathmandu, not in Kolkota. Did you go to Nepal for me? Thank you. Who drew this. The girl who saved my life. Is it her. Do you know her. Vyshali. Say thanks to her. Vaishu... Surya hasn’t come to Nepal, Shalini Don’t worry, whatever happens is for the good wonder what would have happened if he came At the most we would have died, that’s all. I need my phone. Vaishu... hello. Thank you. Vacate this place Vaishu... Do it fast Vaishu... -Do it fast. Do it fast -Vaishu... Run, fast....got to run Vaishu... Vaishu... Vaishu... Hello... grandpa... Slowly... Slowly... Careful... be careful. Dad, I’ll be really fine We’ll go home if the doctor says the same Am I not the best doctor, you know Doctor please... How is your Delhi girl friend Rakesh I moved on Excuse me, what do you want? Did anyone by the name Vaishali get admitted? One minute Please... -Hey Surya, you are still here? Sir... What happened? -Vaishali came. but don’t know where she is Let us hunt for her. I’ll find out. You stay here... From where? -Indian citizen register Okay sir, take this. Hey Surya, Vaishali is safe she is fine right? Where is she, take me please She is in Kolkota, her dad took her Thank you sir Hey, take your vehicle. See you sir. Are you looking for Surya? He did not come. He went on a road trip. His mother too doesn’t know. Shalini... -Uncle. Take her inside Stay for some more time -Okay Maybe it isn’t right pining for one person. I feel low. I too have self respect. There is no person called Surya in my life. He doesn’t deserve me, you know. Vaishu... Vaishu...Don’t think too much. I will leave to Europe Shailu. There is enough time for that. To come out of his thoughts and become normal again, you need to occupy with something. Will talk to you tomorrow, take rest. Surya... -Aunty..Is Vaishali there? She has gone to the college. Thank you somuch for having me here Sir on such a short notice. You are welcome Vaishali. You have been a good student of this college. -Thank you Sir. Okay... -Okay Sir. It's just a matter of time Vaishu, trust me. See how you will forget Surya I have already moved on How are you Vaishali Madam after so many years. Surya Bhai... Vaishali madam has left to the railway station. Yeah I know...Vaishnu...Surya? I've escaped death...must have come to console me. Or else, he has come to convince me that he had been to Nepal for me. I lack patience to bear his lies. Please convey whatever I said to him in a way he understands. I don't understand what you say, how am I supposed to convey all this to him? If he has to stay away from me, this is correct. Sorry. He is your friend? Hi, I am Vaishali. Oh, in that case, I am Ilayaraja So nice, I'm getting late, I will leave. Bye Vaishu...wait. I lied to you that I stayed at home thinking you weren't in Nepal. Are you upset because I was with Padma? Padma is my mother. ..did you forget? We should have married on that day you wanted to...but it isn't late. There is a registrar office close by, let us go and get married. Come Vaishu... please. Come please. Who are you boss? Are you mad, what marriage are you talking about? Whom do you think you are talking to? Surya, I need to talk with you. It is my fault. I was made to ask for a break up... but does that mean she is not going to recognise me ? I don't know how to tell you, She is not the previous Vaishali. she lost some part of her memory due to the injury she sustained during the earth quake. What? It is retrograde amnesia in medical term Retrograde? Amnesia.... She won't remember any of her memories. She can't recollect many happenings related to her despite an effort. You are one amongst those acquaintances, Now she doesn't know you. Hey what are you talking? Are you mad? Why will she forget me? Believe it or not but that is the truth She doesn't know you. She doesn't know me? You have to believe the fact. You are just a stranger to her. don't try to help her recollect her past. It is risky. It is better you begin a new life and move on. Please move on. Hello... Hello Vaishu. Being a doctor, you made another doctor lie. It was very hard to manage him. Did he leave as soon as you spoke all that Actually he was shocked. He probably thought it wouldn't be good crying in my presence. Hey, already you are here. when did you come..? Did he leave immediately...as soon as you spoke I empathised with him. I don't think he will come to you anymore. I have been thinking of him for a year. Shalini... How can he give upon me so easily? Vaishu... I went to Nepal pining to see him... It is okay if he did not go to Nepal.. at least he came now, you should consider him. Oh yeah..he came. But left when you said I lost memory Isn't that what you want...to have Surya out of your life? Yes, but it pains when I learn that he left immediately. Hey Tell me Surya You said something some time back That is... You are just a stranger to her... Vaishali forgot me completely... and she wont remember me if I appear in front of her..right? You have seen that. Her memories... You are not there in her memories. Why are you laughing? So I can begin loving her all over again from tomorrow? I don't understand She will understand from tomorrow. Since how long he's been missing? Sign here. -Since ten days Don't worry, we will make an inquiry What happened? See, your son has arrived Go... Do you have any sense? -Mom... What will I think if you leave without informing. Couldn't you call once? next time I will break your legs if you leave home. -Listen to me mom. Had to go to a trip suddenly..listen to me mother Please... Mother...please Mother...Mother... road... Did you understand. How can she forget just like that. You went behind her, one year you pined for her, you leaving for Nepal..she forgot all that She doesn't remember who Surya is, so how will she know who went behind her, fell for her..? So what will you do now? Only one option... Will try for her again So are we going to run again? Yes. If Queen comes, it is a Show It is a Show if King comes Without rain effect, it is same to same... All same to same. Please save me, (Indistinct Voices...) Stop...stop. Ask her.. Did someone escape from here? This way Run... -Thanks Hey, stop you... Come here guys You said same to same, but this girl has reversed Her father is a judge. What do you know? we are getting scared. -What happened...? You didn't find him? Where are you going? I am hunting.... That fellow, he sneaked into that street.. (Indistinct Voices...) How much amount was robbed...? Hey, wait you.... He is a police? What is our position now? He might strip us and beat Why did you people run into this place? We were practicing football Shall I help you with a good practice? It's good for us. He only entered into our den. Let us not wait for a good time, let us go beat him black & blue We can come and play later. Can't you see me... nonsense. -You go that side. Where are you guys? You got into our hands in a correct time. When did you all make an entry in this confusion. I am in irritation... get lost. Why discuss when we kill and go fast. We left our work there in between. What...? -this is our profession. what...? won't you let us do our work? -What work are you talking about? Won't you let me do my work ? How can she forget me? How can she forget me? Loving her all over again is so difficult you know? Who? You know that? Hit me.. hit me He is telling you to hit...so do it now. Hit me. Hit me hard Excuse me Hey... even if people are hitting and killing me right in front of your eyes.. you don't seem to care I am asking you. Who are you to me that I should take a risk? Friend, relative or a brother? Boyfriend... You didn't understand? Though it is a bit confusing in the beginning, you will get connected in the journey. By the way I am Karthik See you. King... Queen... you know what you have become? You... Joker. After your framed story, we thought Surya will disappear. He came back as Karthik and seems to be quite stubborn in wooing you... He is a real hero. So am I a villain? You used medical terminology to ward him off but what if he gets to know you were lying? How will he know? No one gets a grade without proper preparation. How will you convince him that you have retrograde amnesia without proper research? Where is our coffee? How long has it been? Brother..it has been half an hour since we ordered coffee, where is it? You just had...did you forget? Forgot. Amnesia isn't it? You are not an ordinary actor Even God also cannot catch you... Are you waiting for me? You don't have any work other than roaming around girls? Sir..aren't you football player Karthik? Your goal yesterday was...went mad Shut up. -Just wait. Is madam your girl friend? madam..you are very lucky. They are planning to make him captain of the next Bengal team. He has elevated the power of Telugu people. Madam, sir..one selfie. sir..one selfie. Why did she throw it? Anger. But she need to throw you, for all that over action. If mine is over acting...what is yours? Sorry, my friend went a bit over board in praising. Did he expect me to fall...if he praises you? Why will you fall if he praises me, you will fall if you look down leave me. If I leave you, you might fall. I meant ..down Don't leave don't leave please. You will fall...even if I don't leave you.. I mean for me. Hey... here it seems change of colors. look at this, Surya is actually the captain of the Bengal foot ball team. your acts are confusing, the other day you rejected Surya I am saying the same now too Doesn't look like that too others. At least me. What wrong did he do? Loving me Tell this to him...not me Congratulations. looks like my friend is a big sports star. Hello... I don't need a promotion as a friend. The other day didn't you say a boy friend's post is enough. Don't be worried about not falling for me. You will, that's my responsibility. You will fall. you finish your shopping and come, I will meet Rakesh. Bye. No parking Hello... Hi... Doctor Rakesh? Are you Dr Vaishali -Yeah He is waiting for you Room Number? Thank You. Hi Rakesh Hey Vaishu... You are looking great. Thank you... Enough...sit We are fixed it... lift up.. lift up. Lift it... move... move. Fast... make it fast. Hey Surya... -Move... move. Hey, Surya... -The work for which I came here is done. Sir, please stop. I am very happy Surya... you are such a baddie... you know that. -I know. That is my car. -I know. I and Vaishu on a small ride, your car will be at your place by evening. Here is the keys. There is the taxi.. Taxi...Taxi... Yes... He came here too. Excuse me how did I come here? I remember coming in the car but I can't trace it. I came by a flight and I parked it somewhere here but I can't find it. These people come early in the morning, wonder where they come. If you remember where you need to go, I can drop you Oh God... what a heavy weight. Sure... Lets go... -Yes, lets go. Expensive bikes weigh more. Hey... hey... Move... move... loading is done. Tram Kishore kumar song in a tram background... and Vaishali besides me...what a combination. How many girls did you floor with such sweet talk? Only you... in my previous birth. I say this with Kishore Kumar as the witness, you don't remember but I do. Are you a Telugu person? I saw you somewhere sir. No chance, you must have seen me in my past life. Not past life you crazy fellow, just the other day I am saying no. Can't be you for sure. Do any girls fall for such rowdy guys? Your face. What I meant is there is no similarity between both of you though you look alike. She is an arrogant devil, you can't estimate her arrogance. Her thoughts get me irritated. I can't do you have a heart, whom are you cursing? Why are you getting affected when I call her names? If I abuse that old 'you', it means I am capable of taking care of this present you in the past. I wouldn't let even a fly fall on you. Damn... I am reminded of that day when you beat the pulp of some rowdies who teased her in the train. You are correct she is more than arrogant, wonder why! She is my old girlfriend aren't these girls the same? She is my new girl friend Both of them are the same sir We both are aware of that What about the girl? She don't know. Her chip conked. My steth.... You are just not arrogant, you are always anxious, you got down before I gave it to you What do you plan to do with it My mother is not keeping good health Sorry... and thanks. Surya... -yes. When she is refusing to that extent, how do you love her so much? She forgot Surya here. Not here. She is hurt a great deal for having forgotten him, and she is not able to express it. You are really such a baddie guy. Surya... Vaishnu's cousin is arriving next week. If everything falls in place, he will marry her and take her to America. Felt like sharing it with you. Alright see you. Yeah, Alex... Just reached my aunt's home to get married. Yeah of course with Vaishali. You guys should all come. Ramu I will call you back. Are you coming now...come...come Yes..just now After going to America, you turned fair I have already discussed everything about your marriage. -Sister, how is Vaishali? If I promise, it is enough..it is as good as getting married. -You haven't changed at all aunt, and uncle must have lost weight listening to your words Chatur Ramalingam from America, did you arrive just now? Yes uncle. Where is Vaishali, it has been ages since I have seen here. I'm dying to see her Is it... Here she is... we shall meet later Isn't she pretty? why did you give her photo? Isn't she at home? It is just 5 pm. By the time she reaches home, it will be midnight. We are used to this. You refresh and eat. Came to India to marry thinking it is normal in America, but if it has become normal in India too..what do I say? I like it, since I don't have a reaction like this... I came to get married from California to Kolkatta. Stop joking , thanks for the coffee Vaishu, come on. I am ready. He is the one... what do I do...I am coming wait. Uncle if you move a bit away, I will get to speak to Vaishali okay, carry on. You know Vaishu, during childhood we would run to school this way and you would come first Brother-in-law, mom said we studied together but I don't remember Till 6th class. From then onwards I started liking you What did you see in me in 6th class? You would never lie at all, isn't that enough? Sister, how are you? you didn't recognise me. I was in the train that day, next day rakhi... how is brother in law, good? I am fine... -Convey my regards. Confused fellow. I am there besides you, he should have asked me directly. Your brother lacks clarity Why are you crying dad? This generation girls have turned heartless. How can she say she forgot the guy whom she loved on his face? Worst generation. Whom are you talking about? About me. Thank You -It is okay My daughter Vaishali..you know right? I know sir she is the doctor who turned me into a patient, how will I forget her Vaishu... It should be a punishable offence Punishable offence. How can you arrive at a judgement listening to a one side argument? Tell me what is your argument about You.. -Karthik Chatur... what is the connection between your judgement and Vaishali's argument? Vaishali is calling. You can listen to the story while jogging For today...this is enough Dear... Who is the fortunate girl who has claimed to have forgotten you If you know who she is, you'll die of cardiac arrest. Why should I have a heart problem if I get to know something about your girl friend I meant she is very beautiful Sir.. sister... You have known him before? No, by his talk I could grasp that he is the brother of my future wife. You both came together? We met only after coming here..what sir? Yes sir I met sister and inquired about you. -I was standing besides her, saw. I am talking about him. I am talking about her. You are getting confused, I am talking about both of them I'll kill you I'll kill you if you keep creating relationships with the intention of making money. Don't presume he is innocent and alone, I am with him. What sir? - Yes sir I have changed sir. -Go..go. Go...he is telling right? Cool sir, cool... forgive me Why sir? He was trying to tell me some truth, I misunderstood you... presuming you were stopping him from talking. Please accept my apologies. Thanks for saving me. Okay Chatur... Okay. Okay. Poor guy, he is hurt. A for... Apple P for P for... -Phone Phone. -Good girl Hi Rakesh -why late? Same reason Surya alias Karthik.

She talks to me but she listens to someone else. Focus doctor. -Yes. So you doubt that her eyes are always looking for me and she is all ears to me?

Telling you one last time... whether Surya loves you or you love him, the one facing the problem will be you. Why are you troubling me? Don’t forget that... I’ll take leave Who is he? Listen...not today You seem to be in tension, don’t worry. Didn’t I tell you it is my responsibility to make you fall. Has everything got to be connected with you? Stop stalking me Are you mad? Why are you behaving like this. You appear close but you are so far that I can’t reach you. I hate to let you go you say. In another second you want me out of your life. I don’t understand your mind. If forgetting is your problem, I’ll take care of you Why don’t you understand..forget me What madam, any problem? Who are you..what do you want? I want her. you can’t give right...so you leave. Where have I lost you..Even as I'm with you What will I become..without you I've filled every page in my book with you You've thrown the book aside even without opening it You're that breath of fresh air flowing within me Yet you've taken my breath away I don't want to part ways with you Its only with your thoughts i’m alive I've lost a part of myself to you, Though I know this, I can't leave you Where have I lost you.. Even as I'm with you What will I become..without you Where should I go when you're all around me Your heart is where I reside I only dream about you Please don't turn into a dream. You're the boon that helps me overpower death Don't be the venom that separates me from you Where have I lost you.. Even as I'm with you What will I become..without you. How many times I told you not to call me..? Don’t you understand. I don’t like you at all Why you are irritating me so much... Don't call me ever. Hi, Karthik. I told you something, What did you do about it? Vaishali, she must be loving someone truly. No one is that fortunate here, really you are lucky boss. Mom... Sister, my daughter in law is calling you Mom... What..? -Did you see my file? You asked me 100 times now, I’ll punish you if you ask again Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law... Did you see my file? It’s been a week since I saw you, how will I see your file? I have been wanting to ask you something for a week now, but you aren’t available I know what you want to ask, our marriage won’t happen Why? I am already committed You are lying..aren’t you? Tell me truth. You are lying right...? You know I don’t lie. Does aunt know about your commitment? No Uncle? -He knows Infact dad knows the guy I loved Dad, can you come here once? What..? This marriage won’t happen Why? Vaishali is in love with someone I don’t believe. she is lying. Don’t show your intelligence to me. I gave a word to aunt that Vaishali will be my daughter in law. That is final Ramu..you liked the girl? You liked the girl... don’t give us tension Aunt has clue about what’s happening here, she is just asking with curiosity. My dad has half knowledge, refuses to listen. You know the entire story, why give us tension. What are you saying, I can’t understand? Vaishali is in love with someone Who...? You already know him These days she forgets to tell me many things. Chotu what happened? A football player met with an accident, he won’t survive He won’t survive Paper...paper. Do you know where Shalini is, she isn’t taking the call She is in the OT, emergency case. Some football player met with an accident. Unfortunately he has a Bombay blood group What..Bombay blood group? What happened? What happened? I was worried when they said it was Bombay blood group foot ball player. But I am so happy he is not him. What happened to you.? If you bump into him, you scold him... Now you are worried that he might have met with an accident. What is your problem? You are spoiling your life just because he did not come to Nepal. you are showing him hell. My Surya came to Nepal for me. Vaishu... Vaishu... Vaishu... Why did you hurt him knowing he came to Nepal If every strike happens with an intention of hurting, then the world would have ended in a mother’s womb. When did you come? -I don’t remember How are you feeling now? I’m very happy, Getting vanished with my old memories means... How lucky am I.. Even dad got to know my retrograde amnesia, he looked broken.. Now the thought of forgetting Surya kills me Try to destract yourself from his thoughts. It is impossible. If Surya gets to know of my amnesia he will flee I thought but he said he will make me fall. He did it. Every time I deny myself I fall in love with him, he doesn’t give me a choice. Now tell which stage am I in? Hippocampal atrophy... 40% already sunk Can you explain in a way I understand All the memories you had these days are like birds on a tree. A small noise is enough to make them fly away. Just a bloody sound. Mom... Mom... We don’t know if it exists biologically and scientifically, but we all imagine it... that is feelings. But brain is right within us, it needs logic but heart requires feelings. If the heart gets what it wants, you feel good otherwise you don’t. If you know how you want to live, infact how you are living... you have to ensure there is no gap between them infact you have to give up some things you like for it. Then you will know how to rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Sir I have a question. -Please... Sir, I am married but I am not happy... so as I have to compromises in my career. Infact 22 years back, I too faced the same situation. I divorced Padmavathi and I followed my dream... here I am. Is it so easy... to leave people whom you love. Well. It isn’t as difficult as living together I really need it Isn’t it cheating to give up after deciding on embarking on a journey together? Words like good, bad, cheating exist in the dictionary. Not here. If I had stayed with her, she would have suffered more, that’s why I freed Padmavathi. In fact she must be happy somewhere It isn’t enough if you think that way. The ones who loved you want to be with you till the end. You know why... bacause they are loving you. but this is concerned with feelings. You won’t understand, because you never had it I already told you I don’t have it. infact nobody has it. That's why, I told Padmavathi to forget me. if it is necessary to take pain to live together, why take the burden. It is not a burden, it is a responsibility. We cannot get far away from people who we love, only for the sake of difficulties. we will share or solve the problem. How does one feel when you tell them on the face that they have forgotten you. They are dying for not able to find a reason to live. You seem to be a victim for a non existing feeling. It is easy to forget, learn to move on and train your brain young man. Very simple. I didn’t know it was that simple, but it is difficult to live like this. You are happy forgetting everything, not us... we shall try to get used to it Taxi... Taxi... Surya... Surya... Surya... Hello... I understood where I went wrong. You said there is a register office close by.. shall we marry? What? I am waiting at the register office.. will you come Where do you have to go? Where do you have to go? Registrar office I troubled you a lot, I am sorry, there is no time. Our wedding should happen when I remember everything. There will be many formalities in a register marriage.. -I managed everything...you don't talk. Name... -Karthik Full name -Surya Ravipati Is it Surya or Karthik Surya..Ravipati Surya Parents Ravipati Padmavathi. No father Place of birth Anantapur... Dharmavaram. Well...date of birth 9-5... -06-03-1984. Stop joking 09-05-1986 There is the Registrar Office, let us go get married Come Vaishu.. -Who are you boss, wedding for us? Whom are you talking to? She is not the Vaishali you know, she doesn't know who you are If Vaishali has forgotten Surya she will not recognise me, if I appear before her From tomorrow I will be Mrs. Surya. Take your hand off, Take your hand off, Karthik will notice Surya, there is no one here..whom are you talking about? Oh you forgot him too? Karthik..she doesn't remember you There is nobody here, whom are you talking to? Can't you see him, he is besides you... What..? He became mad stalking you, that retrograde right. Sorry I forgot Why are you crying? He turned mad by professing love to you afresh every day. He should cry... Why are you crying...? Don't cry, it irritates me. Okay. I loved you so much that Surya had to die and Karthik had to be born, you had hurt so much..what wrong did I do? Inferiority... Because I loved you more than I love myself, I believed you when you said you had amnesia. No... I deserve all this.. you have done something very wrong Vaishu Surya.... Surya... Surya... Though I am outwardly angry, I am thrilled inside as I now know you have no Retrograde. Vaishu... Vaishu... Let us start your med school What a stupid question... Ravindranath Tagore Medical College Plus two -Avila convent Then High school? Try Vaishu. She forgot even her school name. Try to remember..please try. I don't remember In alphabetical order..O..for O for orange P for phone, S for stethoscope, T for thermometer. Can you repeat O for Vaishu..O for.. O for Orange S for.. P for.. Vaishu...P for.. Phone Vaishu I told you not to call, don't you understand I don't like you at all. Why do you irritate me, leave me. Poor Surya, Isn't it a better option to die, than live like this. When she realised her memory is fading gradually, she got worried about you Surya. She thought she will forget you, that thought killed her. She made me lie to all that she has no problem but to you she told the truth. She told you that she had forgotten you. That was lie for that moment. but that is the fact. Will you leave her as an orphan... Surya... or will you start loving her again..it is your choice. I will sign only if you tell me your husband's name. You wait..you tell me. Let her say...listen to me... she has to... Surya... That's it here are the garlands Take this. Hey... firstly you... When is the first night? -As your wish. We don't have to run again.
