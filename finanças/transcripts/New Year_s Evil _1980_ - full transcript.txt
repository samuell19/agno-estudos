We definitely have to consider and prepare for the one possibility that lle'll be right here at midnight, Pacific Standard time. Why? Because he has a compulsion lo kill on the hour. It's a sequential drama. With Miss Sullivan as the link. And it's building step by step to a grand climax with his ultimate victim. You.

All those psychopaths have had the need to he big in the media. You gonna tell me that he would try to kill me just for that? Not neccesarily, he's mutilated the breasts of most of his women.

I have had to beg her, through you, for every cent I ever got. -That's not true. -My allowance- Oh yes, it is. See you, you castrated me. And that is not nice. And now you're trying to do the same thing with our son. And I will not stand for it. What do you mean, Richard? Oh, he told me. We had a very interesting discussion while waiting for you. You really don't know. He auditioned for the lead in a series and he didn't tell anybody who he was. He didn't use his Iasi name, so they didn't know that he was Blaze's little boy. And he got it.
