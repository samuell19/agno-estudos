Hello? Hello? Hello! Anybody there? Why, it's a museum! I've always felt at home in museums. Hmm! Giant Robot. Beat you, cock. Cybermen, beat you. Daleks... Beat you. Davros... Davros. Phew! I beat him as well. I was irresistible in those days. Irresistible! Yeti. (LAUGHS) Gundan Robot. Oh! (BEEPING) No, no, no, no. Vervoid. Sea Devil. Ice Warrior. Krarg! Krarg? (SHOUTING) Shada! Shh... The untransmitted story. Why wasn't it transmitted? Oh... Of course, we didn't finish it. Starring Denis Carey and Christopher Neame, written by Douglas Adams. I thought it was a very good script and there was an invisible spaceship. Douglas said, "Anyone can design a visible spaceship, "but to design an invisible spaceship, that needs imagination.” I think he said that or did he say... I think he said "genius". Yes, he said "genius". Poor old Douglas. I wonder what became of him? Huh. That's right, Cambridge! About 1979, punting on the Cam. There was a choir on the corner as I biked by, singing Fauré's Requiem or some train song or other. Daniel Hill. I'd heard he'd become the manager of an old people's home or maybe he went into an old people's home, I can't remember. Or maybe he was always old, I don't know. And Victoria Burgoyne, ah. It was her first television and when she heard it was cancelled, she was so unhappy, she cried a lot. We all cried a lot. We were very sad. Shada. Shada! Shada!

Thanks. -(KNOCK ON DOOR) - Come in. Excuse the muddle. Creative disarray, you know. - Professor Chronotis? - Tea? - Oh, thanks. - Just put the kettle on. Er, Professor Chronotis, I don't know if you remember me. We met at a faculty party a few weeks ago. - It's Chris Parsons. - Oh, yes, of course. - Enjoy these faculty dos, do you? - Well, you know... A lot of boring old dons talking away at each other and never listen to a word anyone else says. - No, well, you said that... - Talk, talk, talk. Never listen. No, well, er... Look, I hope I'm not taking up any of your valuable... Time? Oh, no. When you get to my age, you'll find that time doesn't matter too much. Not that I expect you'll get to my age. - Oh, really? - Yes. I remember talking to the last Master of College but one or was it the last Master but two? Could have been three. - Three? - Yes, nice young chap. Died rather tragically at the age of... Run over by a coach and pair. What was it you said to him? Oh, I don't know. Long time ago, you know. Yes. Professor, when we met, you were kind enough to say that if I dropped by you'd lend me some of your books on carbon dating. - Oh, yes, of course. Happy to. -(KETTLE WHISTLING) Ah, there's the kettle. You'll find the books you want at the far end of this shelf. - Third shelf down. - Thanks. Or is it the second shelf down? Second, I think. Anyway, take what you want. - Milk? - Oh, yes, please. - One lump or two? - Two, please. Sugar? Ah, here we are. Oh, actually, Professor, I've just realised! I'm going to be really late for a seminar. Look, I'm terribly sorry, um... Look, I'll bring these back to you next week, all right? - Yes, of course. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Actually, Professor, could I just ask you, -where did you get that? - Oh, I don't know. I think someone must have left it there when I was out. Yes, well, I'll, er... I'll bring these back as soon as I can. DOCTOR: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell, Judge Jeffreys, - Owen Chadwick. -who? Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the history of Earth have thought here. - Newton, of course. - Oh, definitely Newton. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. That's right. - So Newton invented punting. - Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. (DUCKS QUACKING) Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so... - Restful? - No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in the other. Yes, genius. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours. It's October. I thought you said we were coming here for May Week? I did. May Week's in June here. - I'm confused. - So was the Tardis. Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the water, a punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole. The pole. Er, I think it's about time we went to see if the Professor is back in his room. - Ask me how. - How? For every reaction, there is an opposite and equally different action. (GHOSTLIKE VOICES BABBLING) - Did you just hear voices? - What? Chris Parsons went to the lab and discovered that one of the books he'd borrowed was written in a totally unknown alphabet. Here we are, St Cedd's College, Cambridge. Founded in the year something or other, by someone someone in honour of someone someone someone. In honour of someone whose name escapes me completely. St Cedd? Do you know, I think you're very probably right? - You should have been an historian. -1 am an historian. - Good afternoon, Wilkin. - Good afternoon, Doctor. Wilkin! You remembered me. Why, yes, of course, sir. An honorary degree in 1960. Yes, but how kind of you to remember me. - That's my job, sir. - And you do it splendidly. - Now... - Professor Chronotis, sir? He returned to his room a few minutes ago. Oh, good. Good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak to Professor Chronotis? Because that's who you asked for when you were here in 1964, 1960 and 1955, sir. Did I really? I was here in 1958. - Were you, sir? - Yes, but in a different body. (CHUCKLES) - Yes, sir. - Come along, Doctor. Nice to meet you, Wilkin. Bye-bye. (SIGHS) Yes. -(KNOCK ON DOOR) - Come in. Come in. Over there. - Shh-shh. He'll ask us if we want tea. - Tea? Yes, please. Two cups. - Milk? - Yes, please. - One lump or two? - Two please, and two sugars. Oh, Doctor! How splendid to see you. You too, Professor. This is Romana. Oh, delighted, delighted. I've heard so much about you. - Have you really? - Well, not yet, but I will have done. When Time Lords get to my age, they tend to get their tenses muddled up. - Would you liked some biscuits, too? - Well, I wouldn't have said no. - Crackers? - Oh, sometimes. - Three hundred years? - Yes, my dear. - And in the same set of rooms? - Ever since I retired from Gallifrey. Didn't anybody notice? One of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges. Everyone is so discreet. Now, Doctor, young fellow, what can I do for you? What can you do for me? You mean, what can I do for you? You sent for me. - Sent for you? - Yes, we got your signal. - Signal? what signal? - Yeah. Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, -would we come as soon as possible? - Yes. We come straight away. I never sent you a signal, but it's splendid to see you. - Have another cracker. - will. Professor, if you didn't send a signal, who did? You! You! - Were you addressing me? -1 want Chronotis. - Professor Chronotis. - Where is he? He will not wish to be disturbed. He is with the Doctor. A very old... A very old friend. - Wait. -what for? I've had an idea who sent that message. - Who? - Me. I thought you said you didn't. Yes, I know. Memory's getting a bit touchy of late. Doesn't like to be prodded about too much. But my dear old things, it must be ages since I sent it. I told you you'd got the time wrong, Doctor. - Yes, but you're always saying that. - You're always getting the time wrong. - Professor? - Yes? - What was it about? -what was what about? - The message. - I don't know. You've seen it more recently than I have. - Was it to do with the voices? - What voices? Well, when I was on the river I heard a strange babble of inhuman voices. - Didn't you, Romana? - Yes. Oh, undergraduates talking to each other, I expect. - I've tried to have it banned. - No, no, no, no! It wasn't like that at all. It was the sound of humans or... Or ghosts, very quietly. - Screaming. - Yes. Overwrought imaginings, Doctor. No, I remember what it was. - What? - Delicate matter, slightly. It, uh... It... It was about a book. And no sooner had Chris switched on the spectrographic analyser to examine the book, than smoke started to pour out of it. And then he tried to x-ray the book, which immediately started to glow. Chris switched off the machine, touched the book and burnt his hand. - I say. - Yes? Can I help you? Yes, perhaps you can. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) BAKER: Skagra opened the bag and the sphere emerged, attaching itself to the driver's forehead. The driver, not surprisingly, passed out, and Skagra took charge of the car. (VOICES BABBLING) - Did you just hear voices? - Professor, I think that... I just heard voices. Romana, did you just hear voices? Yes, very faint this time. Anything to do with that book, Professor? What? Oh, no, no, no. That's just a book I accidentally brought back with me from Gallifrey. From Gallifrey? You've brought a book from Gallifrey to Cambridge? Well, just a few knick-knacks. You know how I love my books, Doctor. Professor, you said you brought it back by accident. An oversight. I overlooked the fact that I had decided to bring it. Just for study, you know. And as I'm now getting very old... You thought that perhaps I'd take it straight back to Gallifrey for you. Well, as I'm retired, I'm not allowed to have a Tardis. Professor, I don't want to be critical, but I will. It's very risky bringing books back from Gallifrey. Isn't it? I mean, they could be so dangerous in the wrong hands, hmm? "On some nights, New York is as hot as Bangkok." I've read that. Hmm. Saul Bellow. "Once upon a time..." Read that. Ah! "And in the Great Days of Rassilon, five great principles were laid down... "Can you remember what they were, my children?" -It's just a Gallifreyan nursery book. -I know, I know. -I had it when I was a time tot. -Yeah, it's very good. Oh, that's just a memento. Not the right book at all. Where is it? Is this the one? Oh, dear, no. No, I know it's here somewhere! Professor? Professor? How many books did you bring back, for heaven's sake? Just the odd two or seven, but there was only one that was in any way... Dangerous? What does it look like? What's it called? The Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey. The Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey? Yes. Red book, about five by seven. Professor, how did that book get out of the Panopticon Archives? Well, what I did, you see, was I... I just took it. - Took it? - Yes. There's no one interested in ancient history on Gallifrey any longer, and I thought that certain things would be safer with me. - And were they? - Yes, in principle. Well, excuse me. Delicate matter, Professor, slightly. That book dates back to the days of Rassilon. Does it? Yes, indeed. - It's one of the artefacts. - Is it, indeed? Professor, you know that perfectly well. Rassilon had powers and secrets that even we don't fully understand. You've no idea what might have been hidden in that book. Well, there's no chance of anyone else understanding it, then, is there? I only hope you're right, but we'd better find it. - Romana? - Yes? - Little red book. - Five by seven. - Good, good. - Could be green.

British Book of Bird Life, in colour. - Alternative Betelgeuse. - Time Machine. Wuthering Heights. Tandoori Chicken for Starters? Huh! (SIGHS) Sweeney Todd. Yes, well, there's no sign of The Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey. - Do you really think it's important? - Of course. It's one of the artefacts. - Other than its historical value. - Yes. Each of the artefacts was imbued with stupendous power. I mean, the meaning of most of them has been lost by now but the powers remain and the rituals. I just mouthed the words like everyone else. What words? At the Time Academy induction ceremony. You know, "I swear to protect the ancient law of Gallifrey -"with all my might and main..." - DOCTOR: "With all my might and main." "and will, to the end of my days, with justice "and with honour temper my actions and my thoughts.” Yes. Pompous lot. All words and no actions. Oh, that's not true. What about Salyavin? Salyavin? Oh, yes. He was a boyhood hero of mine. Really, Doctor? A great criminal, your hero? A criminal, yes, but he had such style, such flair, such... - Panache? - Yes, yes. A bit like me in that respect. - Did you ever meet him? - I certainly did not! - All right. - He was imprisoned before I was born. - Where? - Oh... Do you know, I can't remember? - Professor? - Yes? Salyavin. He was a contemporary of yours, wasn't he? Where was he imprisoned? - I just remembered. - I've only just asked you. - What? - Where Salyavin was imprisoned. Salyavin? I'm not talking about Salyavin. Good riddance to him. We must find the book. Professor, what do you think we're doing? - I just remembered. - What? There was a young man here earlier. Came to borrow some books. He might have taken it while I was out in the kitchen making tea. What was his name, Professor? What was his name? Oh, if only I could remember. Oh, dear, I've got a memory like a... Oh, dear, what is it I've got a memory like? What's that thing you strain rice with? - What was his name, Professor? - Was he old? Young? Tall? Short? - I remember! - What? A sieve! That's what it is. I've got a memory like a sieve. What was his name, Professor? - Oh, I can't remember that. - Oh, please, do try. A? A? No, it doesn't begin with A. B? B? B? B? B? BOTH: C? BAKER: Chris Parsons told his friend Clare about the book. Clare decided to wait with the book at the lab while Chris went back to the college to find out more about the extraordinary illegible tome. P. Q. R. X! X! Y? - Young! - Yes! Young Parsons. Born 1956, graduated 1978, honours degree in chemistry. Currently engaged in sigma particles. Where would he be now, Professor? Physics lab, I should think. First left! Yes, yes, I'll be back in two minutes. If I'm not back in two hours, you and the Professor lock yourselves in the Tardis, Right. Right. - More tea, my dear? - Lovely. Two lumps, no sugar. (ENGINE REVVING) (TYRES SCREECHING) (BELL RINGING) (RINGS BELL) Is the Professor alone now? Oh, yes, sir. The Doctor left a few minutes ago. - Oh, dear. - What's the matter? We've run out of milk. Oh, I should think that's the least of our problems. I do feel so stupid losing that book. Don't worry, we'll find it. I hope so. I do hope so. (SHIVERS) You're shivering. Are you cold? No, it's just a feeling. Those voices unnerved me. - A cup of hot tea will do you good. - Mmm. Ah, no milk. I'll just pop out and get some. I don't think that's an awfully good idea, Professor. Why not? It's the only way I know of getting milk, short of having a cow. We've got plenty. Ah, splendid! - Type Forty, isn't it? - Hmm. Yes, came out when I was a boy. That shows you how old I am. -1 shan't be a moment. - Oh, yes, you will. The kitchens are too far from the control chamber. I've never known the Doctor use them anyway. Salyavin! Good riddance to him, Salyavin. Good riddance. Bah! - Undergraduates! -(KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in! Have to be lemon tea, I'm afraid. No milk. - The girl's just gone out to get some. -(VOICES BABBLING) How many of there are you, for heaven's sake? I've only got seven cups. - Professor Chronotis. - Where are the others? Professor Chronotis. -Who are you? -I have come for the book. - Book? What book? - You know what book. I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't got any books. That's to say, I've got plenty of books. What book would you like? The book you took from the Panopticon Archives. What do you know about the Panopticon? The book, Professor. You are to give it to me. - On whose instructions? - Mine, Professor. - Who are you? - My name does not concern you. -Give me the book. -I don't know where it is. If you will not give me the information voluntarily, I will...deduct it from you. I'm sure there is much else in your mind that will interest me. (GROANING) Do not fight it, Professor. Do not fight it or you will die. Then I arrived at the lab and met Clare. I decided to examine the book very closely. I've got the milk. Professor? Come on, K9. K9: Coming, mistress. Professor! -(KNOCK ON DOOR) -Who is it? It's me, Professor. I just came back to... - What's happened? Is he all right? - I don't know. I think he's dead. Negative, mistress. He is alive but he's in a deep coma. - What's happened to him? - Processing data. - Do you know him? - Hardly at all. He just lent me a book. A book? We've been looking for a book. - Chris Parsons? - Chris Parsons? Well, yes. - Have you got it? - No. I left it back at the lab. - You see, I couldn't... - Isn't the Doctor with you? Well, how would I know? I mean, how would I know the Professor was ill? - No, no, no. The Doctor. - What? Mistress, the Professor has been subjected to psychoactive extraction. Will he be all right? Physical prognosis fair, psycho prognosis uncertain. - It's a robot. - Of course. - A robot dog. - Yes. Neat! K9, did you say psychoactive extraction? Affirmative, mistress. Someone has stolen part of his mind. What did your dog say? Someone has stolen part of his mind. His attempts to resist have caused severe cerebral trauma. - He is weakening fast - Is this all for real? - Do you want to make yourself useful? - Well, if I can. Go and get the medical kit from the Tardis. - The what? - Over there. First door on the left, down the corridor, second door on the right, down the corridor, third door on the left, down the corridor, -fourth door on the right... - Down the corridor? No, white cupboard opposite the door, top shelf. For a minute I thought you were pointing at that police box. - I was. - But I... Please get it. What the... Hurry up! Professor, can you hear me? Professor? Professor? - Mistress, his mind has gone. - You said part of it, K9. Affirmative. The part that is left is totally inert Professor! No response, mistress. (CRASHING) (PANTING) Thank you. What are you doing to him? - (BEEPING) - He's breathing and his hearts are beating, so his autonomic brain is functioning. This collar will take over those functions and leave his autonomic brain free. - What good'll that do? - He should be able to think with it. Think with his autonomic brain? Don't be silly! The human brain doesn't work like that. The different functions are separated... The Professor isn't human. Ah. And Clare and I discovered that the book was minus 20,000 years old and decided it must be returned at once. In the ship, Skagra was able to see into Chronotis's mind and view the Professor's experiences. He saw the point at which the student came into the study to borrow the books, but the picture was too distorted fo be of any use. Skagra was determined to find any possible trace of the book in Chronotis's mind, despite the consequences. ROMANA: The collar is functioning. K9, is there any trace of conscious thought? Processing data, mistress. (WHIRRING) Far too early to tell - Good. - What do you mean, good? Well, don't you see? When one works as a scientist, one doesn't always know where one's going, or that there is anywhere for one to go. That there aren't going to be big doors that stay permanently shut to one. But I look at all these marvels and I know that a lot things that seem impossible are possible, 50, good. -I take it that you're... -Romana. No, I mean that you're... Well, you're not from Earth. Mistress, the Professor's condition is rapidly deteriorating. Isn't there anything we can do? Negative, mistress. The condition is terminal. But is he thinking? Can he hear us? Minimal cerebral impulses detectable, mistress. - Can he talk? - Negative. The speech centres of the brain are completely inoperative. Well, your collar was a nice idea but... - Shh! - What? Wait a minute. K9, can you amplify his heartbeat? Affirmative, mistress. (HEARTBEAT THUDDING) - Brilliant! - What? The Professor is a brave and clever man. Listen. I don't understand. He's beating his heart in Gallifreyan Morse. Professor, I can hear you. What do you want to tell us? (HEART BEATING IN RHYTHM) Beware...the... sphere. Beware... - Skagra. - Skagra? Beware...Shada. The...secret... is...in...the... K9: He is dying, mistress. ROMANA: Professor! All life function has now ceased, mistress. The Professor is dead. - Doctor? - Yes. (VOICES BABBLING) I am Skagra. I want the book. Well, I'm the Doctor and you can't have it. You attempt to hide it from me? Yes, it'll be taken to a place of safety. - Where? - Oh, a little place I have in mind. Doctor, you will give to me everything that you have in your mind. Your mind shall be mine. I'm not mad about your tailor.

(WHOOSHING) BAKER: Romana explained that K9 had traced the sphere after it had attacked the Professor. I decided to retrieve the book. Professor. (WHOOSHING) who are you? Chris Parsons, Bristol Grammar School and Johns. Never heard of you. You're the one causing all the trouble. - Me? Well, where's the book? - Where's the Professor? - Well, he just, just, just... - He just what? Well, I just don't know. His body just disappeared into thin air. Where was the body? There. It disappeared just before you arrived. - Here? - Yes. He's gone. He must have been on his very last regeneration. Did you say someone had stolen his mind? - Yes. - Yes. That's what Skagra threatened to do to me. - Skagra? - You know the name? Just before the Professor died, he said three things. - What? - Beware the sphere, beware Skagra. - And beware Shada. - Shada? - Do you know the name? - Shada, Shada. No. You? Doesn't mean anything to me. Well, Mister Skagra, or whatever it is you call yourself, you've killed a Time Lord and a very old friend of mine. It's time you and I had a little chat. - K9! - Master? K9, can you find any trace of that sphere? Affirmative, master, but it is far, far too weak to take a bearing. we'll have to wait till it's active again. Now, listen, K9, the moment the signal becomes clear... - Affirmative, master. - Good, good. - Right, we'll wait in the Tardis. - Excellent thought. Come on. You too, Bristol. (VOICES BABBLING) BAKER: Clare was woken from a deep sleep by the teleprinter. She tore off the text and rushed out Hello? BAKER: As I prepared fo dematerialise, K9 detected the sphere's activity. (WHOOSHING) Hello? (WHOOSHING) Look! - Did you just see what I didn't see? - No. - Neither did I. - It just vanished. That's what I said. Watch that cow pat. Come on, K9. BAKER: The sphere reported fo Skagra that I had escaped and was approaching the ship. - (STATIC) - Oh! Don't move. (HOLLOW BOOM) (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING) - K9, there's something here. - Affirmative, master. Then why didn't you tell me, you stupid animal? I assumed you could see it, master. -(HOLLOW BOOM) - What is it, K9? K9: A spacecraft mistress, of very advanced design. Many of its functions are beyond my capacity to analyse. If I built something that clever I'd want people to see it. Shh! K9, what's it powered by? Insufficient data. Aren't we all? Where does it come from? Insufficient data. - What does it look like? - Very large, mistress. - How large? - One hundred metres long. One hundred metres? That should keep the cows guessing. Hmm. There must be an entrance somewhere. What's that carpet doing there? Got to be an entrance. What's that carpet doing here? BAKER: Skagra instructed the ship to allow us to enter. (WHIRRING) - A door is opening, master. - Affirmative, K9, affirmative. - DOCTOR: Come along, K9, heel. - Affirmative, master. Finding no sign of the sphere, I suspected a trap. Suddenly a cube of light surrounded Romana, Chris and K9 and they disappeared. Skagra revealed himself to me and took me deeper into the ship, assuring me that my companions would come to no harm. I chided him for the death of the Professor, but Skagra revealed that he was only interested in the old man's mind. Chris? Chris Parsons? Professor Chronotis? Chris? BAKER: And in the ship's control room, I was shown the book by Skagra, who attempted to force me to reveal the code in which it was written. Of course I refused, but I kept on asserting my own stupidity. Responding to Skagra's gesture, the sphere attached itself to my head and I let out an agonising cry as I fell back in my seat. There's no door. We must have got here by some sort of matter transference. Very clever. Oh, I suppose you do this sort of thing the whole time. Yes, actually. K9, can't you pick up any trace of the Doctor? Negative, mistress. Every signal is shielded. I was meant to be delivering a paper to the Astronomical Society tonight. Oh, yes? Can you pick up anything now? Negative, mistress. Finally disproved the possibility of life on other planets. - Oh, yes? - Well, I can deliver it next month. - Now try. - Have to be a complete rewrite, though. Triple negative. Curious substance, this wall. Oh, blast it! Please duck. - Apologies, mistress. - Not at all. The wall is blast-proof. It was a good try, K9. Mistress, I am now picking up faint signals. - What is it? Can you let us hear it? - Affirmative, mistress. (VOICES BABBLING) - Sounds different this time. - A new voice has been added. - A new voice? - Affirmative. It is the Doctor. - Oh! - Mind where you're going. You don't know where Professor Chronotis has gone, do you? - Calm down. Isn't he in his room? - No, I've just come from there. Well, that's funny, he didn't come out this way. I'll tell you what. If you'd like to leave a message, I'll see he gets it. Well, look, it's terribly urgent. A book a friend of mine was taking to him, well, I think it's very dangerous. Well, what I say is people shouldn't write things if they don't want people to read them. No, you don't understand. The book itself, it's atomically unstable. It seems to be absorbing radioactivity. I think it's very, very dangerous. - What, a book's doing that? - Yes. We must find the Professor. All right, Miss, I'll tell you what. You go back to his room and I'll ring round the College and see if I can't find out where he's got to. Yes. But wait. Look, it's... All right, I'll go back. I don't know, nowadays they'll publish anything. Are you positive, K9? Absolutely negative? Affirmative. No signals on any frequency, mistress. (EXHALES) Oh, I wish I could get out of here. That's it! - Please explain. - That's what you have to say. I wish we could get out of here. I wish we could get out of here. Oh, I wish we could get out of here! Oh, blast! No! No, no, no, no, K9. No. Good dog. (WHIRRING) ROMANA: Where are you taking me? - Where are you taking me? - Quiet! Or I'll use the sphere on you as well. How did she get out and not me? Insufficient data. Insufficient data! Insufficient data. Oh, why did I ever let myself get involved in this? Insufficient data? (SIGHS) - Where are you taking me? - Your travelling capsule. If you think I'm going to open the door, you're going to be extremely disappointed. It's just as well I have the Doctor's key. Ow! (WHOOSHING) Hmm. (SHRIEKS) In the ship, I slowly came to. The ship wondered why I wasn't dead and I explained that I had let the sphere believe that I was stupid and so it didn't pull at my mind very hard. It had taken a copy of my mind but the original was intact. (EXHALES) Miss? Are you in there, Miss? (WHIRRING) With a fascinating display of illogic logic, I convinced the ship that I was dead in order to secure the release of my companions. The ship agreed, but shut down the oxygen supply. As I sank to the floor gasping for breath, the last thing I heard was the voice of the ship. "Dead men do not require oxygen." (DOCTOR WHO THEME) (EXHALES) Miss? Are you in there, Miss? With a fascinating display of illogic logic, I convinced the ship that I was dead in order to secure the release of my companions. The ship agreed, but shut down the oxygen supply. As I sank to the floor gasping for breath, the last thing I heard was the voice of the ship. "Dead men do not require oxygen." (SIGHS) Not a clue. BAKER: Chris and K9 were transported to the corridor, where they discovered the way to the control room. As they entered, the ship returned the oxygen level to normal. K9 informed me that the Tardis had gone. In fact, the Tardis was now on board a massive command ship. Skagra revealed little fo Romana except that he needed Time Lord technology to discover what the Time Lords had hidden. She was introduced to the Krargs, creatures made of crystallised coal Skagra took her to an annex in the ship which contained coffin-shaped vats of heavy gas. The Krarg Commander required new personnel and pushed a button near the vats. Crystals quickly formed around a basic skeleton. Rapidly, a Krarg was formed. Then it pulled itself out of the vat, Romana was appalled. Meanwhile, on the invisible spaceship, I decided to order the ship back to its last destination. The ship complied, but as the launch procedures commenced, unknown to me, a Krarg started to form in a generation room nearby. I was delighted, until I discovered the journey would take nearly three months. I ordered the ship to stop. I introduced the ship fo new concepts, including switching the conceptual geometer from analogue to digital mode and triggering feedback responses up to readings of 75-839. As the Krarg generation was completed, my voice was heard over the ship's intercom ordering the activation of all re-aligned drive circuits, which would enable the ship to travel anywhere in a couple of minutes. A familiar sound was heard as the ship dematerialised. (WHOOSHING) (HUMMING QUIETLY) (GROANS) Ah! (COUGHS) - What have you done with my machine? - (CLARE GASPS) (CONSOLE BEEPING) Tea? BAKER: On the carrier ship, Skagra was using the sphere to delve into my mind in search of the code that would unravel the secrets of the book. Images were thrown up on the screen, but one word kept recurring. Skagra was frustrated at my apparent lack of knowledge, but he knew the book was the key with which the Time Lords imprisoned their most feared criminals. As the crew and I prepared to dock, the Krarg burst into the control room, determined to kill the intruders. With the help of a booster power line, K9 was able to hold the Krarg immobile. There. May I ask who you are? I am, I was, I will be Professor Chronotis. Oh dear, we Gallifreyans have never managed to come up with a satisfactory form of grammar to cover these situations. Look, I don't understand what's happening. What situation? Timelessness. Standing obliquely to the time fields. Is that what we're doing? Oh yes, and very grateful I am to you for arranging it. Me? But all I did was just press a button and... Yes, I know. A very ancient Tardis, this. I rescued it literally from the scrapheaps. I'm not allowed have one, really, you know. Still, just as well, though, isn't it? Otherwise I'd be dead still. - Still dead? - Oh, yes. (CHUCKLES) Yes, I've been killed. Only your timely mishandling of this machine meant that you tangled with my time fields at the critical moment. You're not following me, are you? - Er, no. - Good. Think of me as a paradox in an anomaly and get on with your tea. Oh, yes. We must find Skagra. - Yes? - He has the book. - Ah! - You know about it? - Well, I sort of ... - It's a very dangerous book and I have been very careless. It is the key to Shada. - Oh. - The ancient time prison of the Time Lords. I see. They have been induced to forget about it. Yes. If Skagra is meddling with time control and time transference, he's only going to Shada for one particular reason and it is imperative -he be stopped. - Well, yes! Um, why? What on earth's there? It's not a matter of what, it's a matter of who. BAKER: Skagra decided the Time Lord code would undoubtedly involve time and reviewed what he thought where my last few hours. Then he took the sphere and Romana back to the Tardis. Chris and I left leaving K9 in control of the Krarg. DISTORTED VOICE: This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study of Advanced Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do not approach. Everything is under our control. DOCTOR: Where are we? - I don't know. - Neither do I. And I don't believe that we travelled hundreds of light years. Why not? You cannot travel faster than light. Einstein. What? Do you understand Einstein? Yes. What? And quantum theory? - Yes. - What? - And Planck? - Yes. What, and Newton? - Yes. - What? - And Schoenberg? - Of course. You've got a lot to unlearn. Ah. Institute for Advanced Science Studies. - ASD. Advanced State of Decay? - Shh. - What? - Shh. - Did you hear something? - No. Shh. A-hal Think Tank. - Quite interesting. - Quite interesting? This is fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. Do you mean to say that all this means something to you? Oh, yes. It's all terribly simple. You see, when... BAKER: Inn the Tardis, Skagra was pondering over the book. As he turned the pages, he realised the Tardis's central column operated as well. When he stopped turning, the column slowed to a halt He realised that time ran backwards over the book and that turning the last page would take him to Shada. Who are they? What are they, Doctor? Victims of Skagra's brain drain. Their intellectual powers have been stolen. But their memory patterns might remain. Yes. But if only they could tell us what happened to them. Yes. What? If only they could tell us what happened to them. - Bristol? - Yes? Bristol, I'd like you to do something for me. - Certainly. - It won't be pleasant. Oh. On returning to the command ship, Skagra informed the Krarg Commander to prepare for entry into Shada and warned Romana that she must prepare to meet one of the most powerful criminals in history, the linchpin of his plans, Salyavin! There we are. Bristol? Yes? I'm going to allow this man access to your intelligence reserves. - Oh. - It's all right, it's only temporary. It might just allow him to function. I just hope you know what you're doing. So do I. So do I. Now, take a deep breath. (CONSOLE BEEPS) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Skagra! K9's continuous blasting was still holding the Krarg paralysed, but the creature's strength was growing. - Who are you? - The Doctor. What are you doing here? Who are you? My name is Caldera. What? Not A St John D Caldera? - The same. - The neurologist? - Yes. - It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. One of the great intellects of your generation. - So are we all. - What? There's AST Thira, the psychologist. GV Santori, the parametricist. LD Ia, the biologist. RAF Akrotiri. Some of the greatest intellects in the universe. And Doctor Skagra. Skagra? Geneticist, astro-engineer and cyberneticist and neuro-structuralist and moral theologian. Yes, and too clever by seven-eighths. Who is he? Where does he come from? - We don't know. - What? But he was very impressive. He offered very handsome fees, so we agreed. To do what? - Don't you see? - No. The Think Tank was his idea. He set it up. He did? To do what? The pooling of intellectual resources by electronic mind transference. What? He conceived it on the grand scale. Just how grand, we didn't realise. Not at first, not until after we had built the sphere but by then it was too late. Why? What happened? He stole our brains! The Krarg was absorbing all the power K9 could pour into it. The blaster beam was now fused into the haze which surrounded the Krarg. He stole our brains. - Shh. Easy, easy. - Stole... Easy. Shh, shh. The whole of humanity. What? - The whole of humanity? - The whole! But he needed... What did he need? One mind. - Which mind? - One unique mind. What mind? - A man called... - What was he called? - A man called... - What was he called? Salyavin! Salyavin? Realising he had lost the battle, K9 headed for the door, followed by the lumbering Krarg. Bristol? Bristol? Are you all right? I feel marvellous! Good, good, it'll pass. You're fit. - What did you find out? - Not much. Not enough to locate Skagra, just enough to frighten me out of my wits. Master! K9! Why aren't you back at... K9, try and keep it back. Power supply at danger level (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) - CHRIS: Doctor, look out! - Ah! (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Bristol? Bristol? Are you all right? I feel marvellous! Good, good, it'll pass. You're fit. - What did you find out? - Not much. Not enough to locate Skagra, just enough to frighten me out of my wits. Master! K9! Why aren't you back at... K9, try and keep it back. Power supply at danger level (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) - CHRIS: Doctor, look out! - Ah! (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) - Bristol? - Yes? - You still feeling marvellous? - Yes. Fine. - Give me 10 seconds. - What? Well, come on, then! Well, come on, then! Doctor, come on! It's going to blow up! Danger, Doctor, Danger! CHRIS: Doctor! (COUGHING) (ALARM BEEPING) Danger, Doctor, Danger! (COUGHING) No, Doctor. (ELECTRICAL ZAPPING) (COUGHING) It's jammed! (BEEPING) ' Danger, Doctor, Danger! ' BAKER: As I rushed into Skagra's ship, I ordered her to lift off and dematerialise immediately. I was determined to find out where Skagra had gone, though the ship resisted telling me. So I asked to be taken to Skagra's home. The ship complied. Clever, eh? Oh! Look, I don't even know what I'm meant to be doing. We must get this old perambulator moving again. Well, it certainly moved when I touched it. Oh, a spasm, a mere spasm. I just hope it wasn't a dying spasm, because it has left us jammed between two irrational time interfaces. Time is moving away from us. If we do manage to disentangle ourselves, I'll just have to be careful, otherwise I shall cease to exist again. Oh. Really? - Now, do as I do. - What's that? - Forget about it. - Oh, Professor, that's easier said than done. (SIGHS) Who is this, uh, Salyavin person? Salyavin? He was a criminal. His exploits have been wildly exaggerated. He was a hot-headed, brilliant young man with a peculiar talent. Uh! -I can't fix this. - Can I help? Difficult, very difficult. To repair an interfacial resonator requires two operations which must be performed absolutely simultaneously. And to be honest, my dear, I don't think you have the knowledge. - So we're stuck? - Yes. Well, I can learn, you know. I'm very quick. What's the matter? Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. What I am about to do, you are never to speak of, and this is the only time I will ever do it. - What are you talking about? - Do I have your promise? - Well, what are you going to do to me? - Do I have your promise? Yes, yes, all right. What is that piece of equipment you have in your hand? - I have absolutely no idea. - Good. Now... What is that piece of equipment? This? Uh... It's a conceptual geometer relay, with an agronomic trigger, a totally defunct field separator. But it doesn't matter. We can dispense with it if we can get that interfacial resonator working again. - Splendid! - Well, let's do that, then, shall we? (CHUCKLES) BAKER: K9, Chris and I emerged into the carrier ship and came face to face with Skagra, Romana and a multitude of Krargs. With the aid of the sphere, Skagra intended to make the whole of creation merge into one single mind, one god-like entity. The universe would be Skagra. As the Krargs prepared to lock up the prisoners, K9, Chris and I made a break for it. Romana was dragged into the Tardis by Skagra and a detachment of Krargs, while the remainder of the creatures pursued my group. Suddenly, I spotted a door and decided to take cover. - Keightley! - Chris? Cup of tea? The Krargs attempted to break into the Professor's room. - Doctor, how do you like my Tardis? - Oh, ace. Ace. It's strictly unofficial. I'm not really allowed to have one. Yes, and what better way to hide it than by living in it, you old sly boots. What are you doing here? How am I supposed to know? Yeah, and what's the Professor's room doing here? (CHUCKLES) Oh, you may well ask. But ask the Professor. - Doctor, where is Skagra? - Shh. Not so loud. - He's just outside. - Oh. He's got Romana, he's got the Tardis, he's got the book. -1 thought you were dead, Professor. - Yes, so did I. - Did you really? - Listen, Doctor, if Skagra has the Tardis and the book, he can get to Shada. - Shada? Shada? - Yes, the Time Lords' prison planet. - You've probably forgotten about it. - I never forget anything. I never forget... Well, that's right. I had forgotten. The Time Lords' prison planet. Now, why would I have forgotten? Got it! Of course! Salyavin was imprisoned on Shada! Yes. - Ask me who Salyavin is. - Oh, now, he was a great criminal imprisoned centuries ago by the Time Lords. A great criminal. Unique mental powers. He had the capacity to project his mind into other minds. - Didn't he, Professor? - That's what Skagra's doing? No, no, no, no, no, no. Skagra, quite the opposite. Skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people but he couldn't put minds into them. That's why he needs Salyavin in his sphere -and that's why he's going to Shada. - Of course! - Doctor! - What? He must not get there. BAKER: Inn the Tardis, Skagra turned the pages of the precious book, activating the central column of the spacecraft by doing so. While Romana watched impassively, the craft proceeded to Shada. With Skagra's mind and Salyavin's in the sphere, Skagra will be omnipotent. What, you really mean he could just move himself into every mind in the universe? Yes, eventually. It might take thousands of years, but that wouldn't matter. His mind would be immortal. It would spread like a disease. CHRIS: It's quite a thought, though, isn't it? I mean, every mind working together as a single organism, a single mind? Skagra's mind. Not a pleasant thought. Well, Doctor, we've got to stop him -from getting to Shada. - Yes. But how? He's got a start on us and we don't know the way. - We must follow him. - CHRIS: But how? The same way as we arrived. You followed the Tardis's space-time trail. Of course! Of course. Let's go! BAKER: Taking Romana and the Krargs with him, Skagra searched the records of Shada to discover the whereabouts of Salyavin. Success! They set off in pursuit of Cabinet 9, Chamber T, leaving Krarg guards at the records centre. Doctor, we've arrived! - Good! Good! Now, you two. - BOTH: Yes? - Stay here. - Oh, but... Ah, no, no, no, shh. I am not at liberty to explain. K9. You can come along, but no tangling with any Krargs, unless of course you have to tangle with any Krargs. - Hurry! Skagra will be here already. - Come on. Come on, K9. The Professor seemed in some way able to know what Skagra was thinking and insisted they head in a particular direction. Skagra, meanwhile, revitalised the prisoners' cabinets. They began to stir. Oh, it's odd the way some days work out, isn't it? - Chris. - I mean, there I was, just cycling down King's Parade... Chris, there's something very odd about the Professor. - Why single out the Professor? - Well, because when I was... I want to know what's going on out there. - Chris, you're not listening to me. - I just don't like getting left behind. I mean, just because we come from Earth, it doesn't give everybody the right to be patronising towards us. Well, admittedly, all this does make us look a bit primitive. I mean, I haven't got the faintest idea how it all works. I have. - You do? - Yes. At least I did a while ago. What do you mean? Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you all along. It's something that the Professor did to me, to my mind. The prisoners were reviving from their sleep. Skagra approached Cabinet 9 and activated the revival as I and my group burst into the chamber. Skagra warned us to keep back. He reached into the cabinet and pulled out a pathetic dummy-like substitute. Skagra's anger mounted and then Professor Chronotis explained that in fact he was Salyavin. Now, let me just get this right. You say he just, well, just walked into your mind? Well, sort of. It was as if he just barged in through the front door and started shuffling all my thoughts about. But the Doctor said that that ability was unique to, well to the guy that Skagra's come here to find... On your feet, Keightley. Come on, let's see what's happening. Shh! Skagra ordered the sphere to drain Salyavin's mind but K9 blasted it into pieces. Each fragment reformed into another smaller sphere, one of which settled on the old man. Skagra was exuberant. "You shall see the beginning of the universal mind," he cried, as the spheres came together, discharging vast amounts of energy. And then each of them attached itself to one of the prisoners, who turned towards me. Chris and Clare entered the chamber, and the young man rushed forward to try to help. A sphere absorbed Chris's mind in an instant. The prisoners, including Chris, advanced menacingly towards me. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Skagra ordered the sphere to drain Salyavin's mind but K9 blasted it into pieces. Each fragment reformed into another smaller sphere, one of which settled on the old man.

A sphere absorbed Chris's mind in an instant. The prisoners, including Chris, advanced menacingly towards me. K9 was quick to the rescue. He fired at one of the prisoners, who collapsed. One of the Krargs lumbered over to K9, picked him up and hurled him through the door. Seizing my chance, I made a run for it with Romana and Clare in tow, and, with K9, burst through the nearest door. Quick, come on, come in. Come on, K9. Sit down! Got it! Well, what are we going to do? So far he's beaten us on every point. - Yes, he's even got Chris. - Mmm. Shh! Shh! Quiet, I'm thinking. I'm thinking, and it depresses me. Skagra's little zombie gang have got the brain power of the greatest intellects of the universe shared out among them. - The Think Tank. - The who? Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that Skagra's stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own and operating as one. And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind in there, too, they can now control anyone. They can control everyone. They'll be invincible. - Doctor? - Yes? - May I just remind you of something? - Yes. All the minds that Skagra's stolen are in the melting pot. DOCTOR: Yes. - That means yours is in there, too. - Yes! - Romana? - Yes, Doctor? Romana, I want you to do something for me. Stand there. Romana, I want you to wear this. (EXHALES) Well, now I can think. Skagra and his entourage of prisoners returned to the Tardis, where he announced his intention to return to the carrier ship. From there, each of them would be taken by small craft fo various population centres. The great mind revolution was about to begin. (EXHALING) - It'll be tricky. - And dangerous. Well, a touch. Doctor, it'll be terribly, terribly dangerous for you. - You'll stand about as much chance as... - As what? There isn't anything that stands as little chance as you will out there. Really? Well, I'll just have to be... I'll just have to be very brave, won't I? - Doctor, it isn't funny. - Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine. I'll try. You're a hero. Remember? - Clare? - Yes, Doctor? Hold on very tight. Skagra realised that something was wrong. - Ready? - Yes. - Clare? - Ready, Doctor. DOCTOR: Hold tight. Now! BAKER: I was travelling through the space-time vortex in the college room Tardis, which was generating a force-field. (LAUGHS) Got them. Well done, Romana. - We haven't got to the hard bit yet. - No, we haven't got long. - Clare? - Yes, Doctor, I'm holding on. Come over here and hold onto this, then. Now, whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a very, very rough ride. And twenty-thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time and distance have no meaning. But here in this little, little room... Oh, get on with it, Doctor! - Romana? - Yes, Doctor? I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area here. Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one little bit of timelessness and spacelessness. Over there, behind the tea trolley. I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it. I'm sorry, but it's very difficult. Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it. - Hold it! - I'm trying, Doctor. I'm trying! (SIGHS) Right. Now, this is a little trick I learnt from a space-time mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy. (GASPS) He did it! Hold that switch down! BAKER: The college room Tardis was just holding the police box in the force-field as I appeared in it Slowly, I half-crawled, half-swam up the tunnel in great pain. It won't hold much longer. It's fading even faster than the Doctor said it would. K9, K9, wake up and come here. (GRUNTS) Check out the sub-neutron circuits. Detect circuit malfunction, mistress. With increasing difficulty, I was able to reach the Tardis in the time tunnel. I just managed to get part of my arm through it. Impossible to effect repair in time available, mistress. Well, hold it, K9. Stop it deteriorating. Impossible to stop it mistress. I can only slow down circuit deterioration. The Doctor needs every second we can give him. This switch is getting very hot. You must hold it down. - But I can't. It's getting hotter. -(SIGHS) I seemed unable to get any further. In fact, I started to slide backwards. It's burning me. Oh, hold it down with a pencil. But I haven't got one. ROMANA: I can't reach it. Well, here, hold this. (BOTH GRUNTING) BAKER: And I vanished as the room and the Tardis spun wildly away from each other. What about the Doctor? I don't know. It was a very dangerous idea trying to make that crossing, and he didn't get as much time as he wanted. I just don't know. What should we do? Well, we'll just go ahead as planned. There. How's that? Oh, that's fine, thank you. It wasn't a bad burn. (SIGHS) Well, do you think the Doctor will be all right? We'll just go ahead as planned. Then I regained consciousness in a small equipment room in the Tardis. I rummaged through the equipment. In the carrier ship, the Tardis arrived. Skagra planned an infinite concert of the mind as he surveyed the stars from the command deck, unaware of my presence on board. - Repairs completed, mistress. - Let me see. Good boy, K9. Now we can go. Though I dread to think what we're walking into if... Oh, well, let's just do it. I managed to lash up a helmet-like affair made with bits of electronic equipment and a chunk of table top. The Professor's Tardis, now in its usual form of a door, materialised on the command deck. An unpleasant welcome committee was prepared for me, but it was K9 who emerged from the door. I'd been watching all this on my own Tardis screen and emerged wearing the strange helmet. All the prisoners turned to face me as Skagra threatened my life. I pressed a button on my helmet and looked hard at Skagra, as did all the prisoners in unison. With intense mental effort, Skagra tried to control the prisoners, but I told him he'd forgotten something, and that the deranged billiard ball had been used once too often, and that my brain was in there as well. Skagra strained for control. The prisoners nearest him turned to face me, the ones in the middle of the hall were confused, and the ones near to me were firmly fixed looking at Skagra. A mighty battle of wills took place, with me gaining the upper hand. Momentarily distracted by a Krarg, I lost control and a prisoner swung towards me. "Fire, K9," I called, and the metallic computer held the Krarg in a beam near the door to the generation annexe. The prisoners split into two groups as I regained some lost ground. The two groups wrestled with each other, obeying mental instructions from their two leaders. I manoeuvred Skagra nearer to the dangerously overheated Krarg. The evil genius ordered the Krarg to back off. It did, and fell backwards into its generation vat, where it dissolved. K9 was firing relentlessly at the reinforcements of Krargs who arrived. Skagra thought victory was within his grasp as Romana emerged cautiously from the door and into the generation annexe, where she tipped over the vats of heavy gas, which poured into the main command deck. She examined the wires of the main vat, pulled them out of the sockets and trailing the wires, marched forward to Clare. The girls made for opposite sides of the room, which was now swimming in the green gas. Skagra had turned the tables on me. I was being forced towards burning Krargs. Romana and Clare plunged their wires into the gas. The Krargs started to dissolve. As Skagra stood appalled, I took mind control, and the prisoners, in a solid phalanx, turned on Skagra and he ran for his ship. Onboard, he ordered it to take off instantly, but a block of light engulfed him and he vanished and was deposited in the ship's brig. Ship! Let me out of here. I am your lord Skagra. Let me out! SHIP: I am very much afraid I can no longer accept your orders. You are an enemy of my lord the Doctor. I am your lord! I built you! Release me, I command you. And-and-and launch instantly! SHIP: Do you know the Doctor well? He is a wonderful, wonderful man. He has done the most extraordinary things to my circuitry. Release me! Truly wonderful. If you like, I will tell you all about him. Let me out! Let me out! (SHIP LAUGHING) Romana and Clare were tending to the prisoners, who were in shock, while I was dissecting the spheres to restore the genii's minds to them. I intended to take them back to Shada, as I refused to play judge and jury. I informed them that Shada was only forgotten because Salyavin made the Time Lords forget. He didn't want his escape discovered, hence he stole the book when he left Gallifrey. Stolen a room? That is the only way I can describe it. Well, you see, sir, in my experience, people don't usually steal rooms very much. They may steal from rooms, but steal the rooms themselves? Very rarely. In fact, I think, uh, "never" is probably the word I'm looking for here, sir. I mean, where's the advantage in it? Not much of a black market in rooms, is there? Wouldn't get much for it. I know it's very difficult to understand, it's also very easy to be sarcastic. Sarcastic, sir? I don't know the word. Now, why don't you run over the salient points again? Oh, well, I got to the door of the room and I opened it and beyond it there was nothing. - Nothing at all, sir? - Absolutely nothing at all. Well, nothing except for this sort of blue haze. Ah, well, the blue haze, you see, sir, might be the vital clue we're searching for. And I was not drinking. Romana wondered whether Chronotis, or rather Salyavin, was still alive on Shada, considering that the reason the Professor called me to Earth in the first place was because he thought he was near the end of his lives. - So this is the famous door, is it, sir? - Yes. Behind which you saw your, uh, blue haze? Yes. DOCTOR: Come in! Well, whoever took it, sir, seems to have brought it back, don't they? "'Her little homely dress, her favourite,' cried the old man, "pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand. "'She'll miss it when she wakes. Hello. Can I help you? Routine inquiry, sir. Report that this room has been stolen. - (SCOFFS) - Stolen? I don't think so, Officer. Ah, here you are. Cup of tea and some aspirin. - Thank you, Professor. - Aspirin, sir? Yes, headache. Bad night last night, sir? Yes, you could say that. A lot of celebrating going on in college, was there, sir, last night? Nothing out of the ordinary. The normal hijinks that would be, then, sir, would it? Students roaming the streets stealing policemen's helmets, bollards and... Might I ask where you got that, sir? Yes, it's mine. - CONSTABLE: Oh, really, sir? - Yes, really. Come on, Romana. Bye, Wilkin, Bristol, Keightley. Goodbye, Professor, we'll keep your secret. - Bye, everybody. - Bye! Secret, sir? And what secret would that be? (WHOOSHING) Cup of tea? Where did that police box go? What police box would that be, Officer? Right. Right. Coats on, everyone. You're all taking a little walk with me down to the Bridewell. Romana explained how she found it hard to believe that the Professor was the great Salyavin when he was such a nice old man and I speculated that in a few hundred years someone would meet me and say, "Is that really the Doctor? "How strange. He seemed such a nice old man." (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
