Nikolayev, Vsevolod Larionov script editor Arcadiy Snesarev montage Margarita Miheyeva production manager Lyubov Butyrina What a bother this Divine Fire is... One's always guarding it... looking after it... I must hurry Hephaestus. Look, friend Hephaestus, what I brought you! - Ah, friend Prometheus... You always come with something new! What is it? I taught people to work with stone! Believe me, it wasn't easy. But now, by using stone, a tree can be hollowed out into a boat. you can tie it to a stick and dig up the earth. You can protect yourself against beasts, and... - HA, HA, HA, HA. Needless to say - you've taught them! Ha-ha-ha! Better feast your eyes on my latest work: The Divine Fire of our Lord Zeus will have a reliable guardian. What a monster! What are you wasting your talents on, friend Hephaestus? If you only knew how much the fire of Zeus is needed down there! To whom would it be useful there? - To humankind! It would warm the earth they stood on, inflame their hearts... ...and light their minds. - You're going on about people again? - I just came from there! Ye gods! Send us warmth! Send us the heat of the Gods! Light their thoughts? Do you realize what you are considering there? In fact if people get the Sacred Fire they become like us... Gods But who then could tell the difference between gods and people? Can you imagine what confusion it would give? Hey, no really! My bronze warrior knows one thing: Obey. Picture this: A thief comes stealing the Sacred Fire... Ah-ah-ah! Stop him! He's choking me! - How? How can I stop him? - The Key! Turn it! Hurry ... Well, well! - Did you see that? - Ha-ha-ha! Yes! You're an incomparable master, friend Hephaestus! Come what may! I will help them! It can't be! Prometheus. It could be nobody else... "Prometheus. Nobody else." Shut up! Shut up! - My finest creation! - I will console you, my son Hephaestus. You must catch and punish the defiant one. Me? I can not do that. Prometheus is my friend. Have mercy on me, my Lord! What's the delay? Anguish, doubt? Look, master, the hand of the gods can be heavy ... Remember how you once were thrown down from Olympus. You're limping until this very day. Lights! There are lights everywhere! We must extinguish them! All of them! All of them! - Whom have you drawn? - A Goddess! Very pretty... All the same, you're not the equals of the gods! - I want to find Prometheus, and talk to him. - Now nothing can be done. We must wait for the right moment. - I will never execute Prometheus! - You can calm down. Your friend isn't as simple to defeat as you think. While he is holding at least one lobe of the Sacred Fire - He is invulnerable! So that's why! And I didn't realize! This is why he is so daring. Ha! We know these Titans! Gestures, exploits, but they do not forget themselves! Oh! Another fire! And another! And more! - Help me! - It's useless. We can't put them all out now! Great Zeus! Great Zeus! All is lost!! Ha, ha, ha! Your laugh too early, Father of the Gods. While I live, fire will always burn on the earth! What did I tell you? One petal our Prometheus has kept for himself! Anyone in his place would have done the same. Now we can't do anything with him, right? Right. He's a sly one. He thinks of everything. Look! A fire! We're saved! Live, oh human race! - Oh! He's brought ruin upon himself! - Now he's in our hands! Well, who's won now? - But... You yourself are... Why did you do it? - Heh. If you didn't understand that just now, Hephaestus my friend, you will never understand it. Forgive me, friend Prometheus, I did not want this... They made me do it! - It's the will of Zeus? - It's the will of Zeus ... It is better for me to be chained to this rock, than be a slave to Zeus! It's done! Now tell me: why did you go do all this? What secret reasons did you have? Confess, and your agony will be lightened. Yes, yes. Think of your destiny. Think! What had you expected? I wanted to help mankind! You want us to believe that?! Now tell the truth! Will you speak? I wanted to help mankind! Lies! I wanted to help people! Gods, you are unjust! Confess! Only one word - and you will be spared! You still do not understand! Why don't you? It's so simple. Say: "I'm sorry. I wanted authority, strength, power." Everyone will understand. I wanted to help mankind. It's that simple. Don't you understand? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! He's laughing at us! You learned little from your suffering, so get the most terrible punishment: - oblivion! I wanted to help people! And I helped them! It is done! There is no Prometheus! And never was! - Do not leave me here! Save me. - The fire speaks! It's his fire! We have saved your gift, Prometheus! The End (subs by Chapaev, Eus & Niffiwan)
