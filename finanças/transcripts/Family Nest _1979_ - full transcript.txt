This is a true story. It didn't happen... ...to the actors in our film, but it could have happened to them, too. Presents THE FAMILY NEST With Music Production crew Sound engineer Assistant cameraman, producer Images Scenario and direction - Careful! - Hang on. You don't see it? Now? The twelfth? The next. - That means nothing to me right now. - 3.30 You sign where you want, or I just cross it.. Not even twice more. Excuse me. Where are you, Zoli? Zoli, come on then! That's terrible. Hold that for a bit. Well then. What's your name? Jonas, isn't it? Say hello to your husband. What's for dinner? There's stew with potatoes. Stew again! What else could I serve up? - Couldn't you make something different? - Like what? A bit of soup. You know I like that. Your dear daughter-in-law is making crepes. How do you expect me to make a soup? You expecting visitors or what? Yes, one of my colleagues, but you didn't give me time to explain. - This is my father-in-law - Kovacs, how do you do. You're inviting guests to my appartment? And when did you get back? - At five o'clock. - Don't bug me all the time. All the same you're not to invite guests here. In my appartment. But she also has to do the cooking, she has a child. So that's why you made the crepes? To give some to your friend? Yes, and I like them as well! And I can do what I want with my money! What? You do what you want with your money. That doesn't count at all. I do my own cooking. You should pay your own rent as well. - Better look for another place. - As soon as I can, I will! You can't do it while your son is doing military service. It's not a question of throwing her out. But you promised me that it was only for a limited period. And when is my son going to finish his service. That's what I would like to know. And it's not only me, it's your son, and your little grand-daughter too.... that you will be booting out. - Yes, him too. But not the child. - It's easy for you. You have an appartment. My little one! Here, grandpa is bringing you some nuts. Take them. I didn't start out like that. - I took all knocks and lasted through. - And on top of that she puts on airs. She invites her friends here to dinner. But she also has to prepare food for the child. If the child only liked what she makes one couldn't argue. But since we all have to live together... it's better that we cook one after the other. - Whoever comes back first. - We all live together, But when it's a question of money, suddenly that's forgotten. Expenses, food, it's always us who pays. It would be better after all if you lived with your mother. They're putting on an act. You see? She still doesn't know what it's about. She should be happy. If I wasn't working we wouldn't even have enough to buy paprika. You see this circus? You see? For her friends, there's enough. For them, there's always enough. Sausage at three crowns! Salami is more nourishing for me, it lasts the whole day. Janika, have you done your homework? What is he getting at with this appartment business? He says it because he owns it. He knows very well that I can't go anywhere else. I knew from the beginning that there were no appartments. But even if I had an appartment and ten kids I wouldn't behave like that. It makes me sick to watch him. And when he argues with you... I get so nervous. My sister-in-law is really well set up. I can't really tell them that they're in the wrong... because, after all, we're living in the same appartment. But they keep on complaining, "Why don't I find another place?" "Why do I keep getting in their way?" And they're also mean to the kid. I'm tense when I go to bed, and I'm tense when I wake up. Do I bug them so much? I can't wait to leave! But Laci is going to create a scene! You don't have to make up stories. He's being supported too! They're always sending him parcels! When he got leave he never had any money. - He drank it all up with his buddies. - I couldn't do anything. Even if he is my son, I'd give him a whack when he came home. They only get at me when he's not there. - Want some? - Just a bit. It's always difficult when one doesn't have a hubby on hand... to protect one. If I had a husband, I would come here only to visit. And I wouldn't stay, not even if it was real late at night. Daughter, so you have often said. If I had an appartment. Two days later, when you walked by here, you sent in your son, to ask how I was, since I'd been ill. Yes, I'd heard you were ill. Anything wrong with that? And you? Why didn't you come in? Beacause I didn't want to be thrown out. The government of the Hungarian Peoples Republic... and the Central Committee of the Young Communist League... have signed an agreement in the presence of... Ferenc Havasi, Central Commitee member of POSH... and deputy prime minister, and Laszlo Marothy, member of the politburo, and first secretary of the Young Communist League. The ninth Congress of the Young Communist League has declared... that it will oversee the construction work on the atomic reactor at Paks. It's for the men who work there, not us And if the men do go there, then they will given be an appartment. They won't give me an appartment just for the asking. Is there no other factory down there? - I'd even carry bricks and mortar. - It's work like any other. I might even break some. Just like that. So could you. Why me? I already have an appartment. Why should I do it? You want too many things, that's your trouble. You came back? I brought you your son. So nice, my son! You came back? Laci, my boy! You've been demobbed? You could say that. Long live civilian life. You didn't even write!? Did you desert? - You're not in uniform? - No, he's finished his service. I know it. You're very welcome. Sit down, take off your coat. Have you eaten? - Come, sit down here. - No, I haven't eaten. Well then, eat. And you, too. Eat...good. My husband has returned. This is my colleague. Good day, Iren. Your daddy is there. If you're not happy about it, why bother me? Go and see your mother. She's already nodding off. She's going to bed. Go to bed, my son. Sleep well. Breathe on me. How big he is! You know, I met up with Gabi at the bistro. We had a few glasses. I knew it, you smell of brandy. The main thing is, you're here. Here you are, a good healthy stew Go on, serve yourself I'll say straight out, I thought you would stay in a lot longer. No, not at all. A soldier's life is the finest there is. If you had accepted a commission you would have had an appartment that much quicker, it would have been easier for you. An officer's appartment, a good future, good pay. Or do you want to go back to the shipyards? As a welder? Yes, of course, it's better work. And then you cry all night because your eyes hurt, and I have to cut potatoes so as to cool them. They always argue with me. They always blame me... for not paying the rent, and for not eating with them... And they say I should leave. Now maybe we'll be able to leave. Sublet somewhere. You should look for a solution. - I'll go and work. - What? I'll do housework. We'll certainly get us an appartment that way. It's not so easy any more. I've already heard the talk about Paks. Even there, there's a wait of at least two years. I don't know how many years you'd have to work before you got one. If you have a family they give you... one and a half rooms until your appartment is ready. But you should both work. We'll leave. We'll certainly find a way. But now we should all be happy that he's come home. Isn't that right? Come, let's go and lie down while papa eats. Come, we'll let papa eat. I'm so happy to see my son come home. Where is papa? Papa is there, don't you see? Papa. Pour me some. You've already had two glasses like that. You mean it's you who've drunk two glasses like that... - No, he's hardly drunk. - Just a bit. Krisztike, don't snivel, or I'll give you something to cry about Well, what's the trouble? - Iren, you take some too. - I'll eat here with Laci. - Go on, take some. - No, that's enough for us. Water! For your friend also. - Here are the potatoes. - She's shy. Serve yourself like at home. But not too much, or there won't be enough to go round. That's not mine. Your health, my boy! In celebrate your return. It's not something you want to remember. I know how it is. It's a bad memory. I'll work there and I went to see her... to find out about the job, since she's worked there such a long time. You sign a contract... but I still don't know yet what the work's like down there. And where are you going to live? At the workers' hostel, it's already arranged. You know, Budapest is not as luxurious as you imagine. You would have done better to have stayed in your little village - That's true There you have all you need, and it's a lot cheaper. Whereas here, you can't buy anything. - But I want to have fun, too. - You think life is just is just a bowl of cherries. And there you also have the cultural center, the cinema. What more do you want? You can even dance there as well. - But here, it's different? - How different? - It's very expensive. - At Budapest... you have to pay through the nose, if you want to have fun. And if you have fun, you don't eat, and you can't buy clothes It's one thing or the other. But others manage! Certainly not on their salary alone. You haven't been a soldier like my father. Tell us about it. The army then wasn't like it is now. I was with the parachutists. We had to climb up on the plane while it was still moving. Not like today. We did it, we did. The planes had one or two motors, not like today with the jets. My commandant ordered me... to repair a broken motor... and I had to crawl out on the wing... in full flight to repair it. It's not like that today... the plane lands and the mechanics repair it on the ground. That's what I did, in 44 and 45. I told the other guys that we had to run. The Germans would have arrested us. I was a lad of 18 years. They sent us to the front. They put us into uniform. They gave me enormous clodhoppers. There were 4 or 5 chaps... from Auguszta. I was with them. I told them it would finish badly. We took with us whatever we could... a grenade in each hand... - Ace of spades. - The ace is called. We went to Koszeg, near the frontier. And that night we ran off... The military police came... and asked where were the Hungarians. We were deserters. We hid in the barns. Ace of clubs... - Listen... - Same, but hearts... The next day we left at dawn... A motorcycle cop saw us. They were on our tail already! Don't look at my cards! Sure, it's easy to play when you cheat. Ace of clubs. We got into a fight with the military police. Two of my pals died. Well, got anything? Oh papa! - That's a lot. - You're wrong there. - Why? - Because. That's not true. Because if you put in a small one, it's not enough. That's all I've got. - The ace of hearts was there. - Was it ours? Ace of clubs, that's Gabi. That's why I said it. Now it's your turn to spin a yarn. You were arrested? Yes? - 30 days. - 30 days! It's better than the front line. I'll bring you some water, OK? - Come. - By cheating. But now, we're together, us two. What is it now? - Who won? - That's 40, and then 20. You're not paying attention. What are you doing? But what are you doing? He's listening, but he's thinking about something else. What do you say? Your daughter-in-law... brings in this gypsy. She stuffs her with food, with coffee, with cigarettes... - You'll have to talk with your wife. - What do you say? They're not friends, they're vultures. - I'll forbid her. - I certainly hope it will be different now. I'll tell her, but let me play. She'll finish by giving them our beds. Only for a few nights, of course. That's her business. Better tell her immediately that there's room on my side of the bed. Gabi hasn't asked anybody to sleep here. - I don't want to defend her, but... - But yes! I don't defend her, but... I've got the cards, hee hee. That's it, trumps, isn't it? - And that girl. - That's it. - It was the ten of diamonds. - The ten. The ten. I'm out. I'm out too. - Dad, it's your turn. - Thanks for the dinner. - Sorry to have disturbed you so long. - Stay, stay. If she wants to go, let her. - How kind you are. - Yes. It's the first time that I've stayed in a workers, hostel. Is there something wrong? There are a lot of things wrong. Where are you going? Thanks for everything. Lets go out for a beer. Gabi will come too. We'll come right back. I'll tell Iren... never to invite anyone here. Please tell Iren that we are gouing to meet at the factory... ...at 6 a.m. - Good. - Good bye. - Good bye. - I'm so glad to have met you. - Cheers. Me too. We'll come right back. We won't stay long. Better return before midnight, my boy. I don't want to have to go looking for you. Let's make up the bed and turn in. It's half past 11. I'm curious to know whether he'll return before midnight. Let's hope so. Jansci's coat as well. Right, I'll make up the bed. No, no, let me go. No. Let me go. Let me go! No. Let me go. Why? Stay calm. Get stuffed. - Let me go. - What is it? My hands hurt. If you scream others will come. Is that what you want? - Let me go. - You prefer a longer queue, is that it? Now there are just two us. Why are you hurting me? Let me go. Go away. Why? Let me go away. Let me go. You can go away after. There are two of us. Let me go. Don't scream. You'll wake the whole neighbourhood. I hate you, I hate you. Two brandies and two beers. - 5,70. And two beers? - Yes. 14.70. 50 and 50, that makes 100. You're there? Don't pay any attention to what they say. And it will be OK. For sure. It will be better, then? For sure. Don't bother about what they say! Just concern yourself with me. You'll see... Everything will turn out for the best? Sure. In any case, certainly better than... It doesn't work like that. If only we could get away, it'd be different. I'm waiting for the sun, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, I'm waiting for the new day, yes, I'm waiting for the new day to arrive. It'll all be better and more beautiful And I'll be afraid of nothing. That's why I'm waiting for the new day The mist will roll away from the fields. I'm sure of it. Believe me, from my heart, we'd do no harm, if we were not afraid. Always let your heart sing Don't torment yourself, be care-free. Like the bird who rides the wind, and greets you with his song, Be always gay. All, all is well Only without this song will harm enter. And while we wait, let's sing, and the little bird will too, And a pretty girl is waiting for you somewhere. Attention! Bandi Sik and Gabi Cseh please come immediately to the entrance. Bandi Sik and Gabi Cseh's grandfathers are waiting at the entrance. Bandi Sik and Gabi Cseh's grandfathers are waiting at the entrance. - I want that. - You can have it after the soup. You eat it like soup? - What part's that. - A thigh. There. I want a chicken like daddy's got. You'll get some meat, but eat that first. You want everything like daddy. Do you like him that much? - I don't like him. - You don't like him? I'm giving you some potato in mummy's dish. - There. - In there, I'm bringing it. - There. - I want it there. It needs some salt. Put some in then! Better without salt than with too much. - Some meat? - Needs salt too. - Do you always have to criticize? - Stay calm. When it's me who looks after the kid... she doesn't play up. She eats everything. Must eat with a fork. - Mum, give me a potato. - Salad too? - Don't want. Mum's forgotten to add salt. Tell mum that she should learn to cook. No meat... Don't eat like a pig. It's not pig pate' so that... you need eat with your fingers. Why not? If she wants to. At least she'll put on some weight. You're bringing up your daughter a real treat. You were happy when your child could eat, even if it's with the fingers. Don't talk to me about the past. The point is what is going on now, here, at my table. That also happened at your table. Eat. Look at what she's doing now. Look at what she's doing with the salt. She's pouring it over herself, and over her father. Don't let the child behave like a savage. You have to bring her up properly, just as I did with my three. Krisztike, don't touch the salt because father will get angry. You see, my boy? Why don't you tell her to be more polite with me? I am polite enough, I think. All through the meal she has done done nothing but annoy me. - But not for much longer, I hope. - That's for sure. - You'll come to regret this. - I hope so. Don't do that, dear. I see it all, but I don't want to spoil the fun. I thought it might be possible to have a peaceful meal... but no, there are always these hateful remarks. You just can't stop yourself doing it. They never leave me in peace, not even when I'm alone. Eat Krisztike, eat. Broken. Lick your fingers clean, if your mother taught you to eat like that. - Eat any way you want to. - Good. Krisztike, make a good mess, I see that that pleases your mother. - Take it. - Go on, make a good mess. - Take it, Iren. - Thanks. - Want some? - Thankyou, I want nothing. And a glass of wine? No, later with father. - Drink, father. - Cheers. Everything is blended in. I see. When aunt Boszi was here do you know what she did? - She mixed the whole tart like that. - We had to scrape it off the walls. Yes, that's your system, beat it to death. For the whole year she's been living here. We'll talk about it when we have separate lives. Separate? That's what you always say. All the time you've been here. - Your health, father. - That's just a way of mocking me. You can't wait for something to happen to me, eh? That's what I call a dutiful daughter-in-law! I'll get indigestion if you start up again. You've got the digestion of a horse. Eat, Krisztike. What are you eating now? Tell me, what is it? Cake. There's not enough cream, I can't see your moustache. I'll wash her hands, there's no need to pick on her. Leave me alone, for God's sake. Can't you think of something else to do? - Of course. - Well, that's good. Don't eat like a pig. You don't look after your child nor your husband. That's no way to bring up a child, look how she eats. The pub looks after my husband, and I look after my child. Don't refer to my son as a pub crawler. You said yourself that he's always sober. Don't bring shame on my family by using such a term. Perhaps there are drunks in your family, but not in mine. My sons aren't drunks. - Aren't you ever going to stop. - I don't want to stop. Alright, I will stop, now! Come. - You're not angry? - Yes. Of course she's angry, when you nag her all the time. I'm allowed to talk. But not all the time. - Because you let her get away with it. - No, look. You never have an opinion about anything. - Yes, I do. - You never take part. We're going for a walk. In front of the others, when we're dining, it's always she who starts it. She can't stop talking. She's walks around half-dressed, and she never uses a serviette. Are we going for a walk? Shall we go? Drink something, dad. Do you think she can stay faithful? I've seen what she does. I didn't want to tell you. She always says that she's out with her friends. - I believe what I see. - You always believe her. She's double-crossing you, Laci, believe me, she is. It's possible. And you say nothing? Consider the example of your mother, who has always been so faithful to me. - You haven't noticed? - I don't know. She doesn't look after the child. I can't stand that woman. She'll ruin your life. She'll ruin ours too. All the family harmony. Think about it. You don't have to be so blind. - Think about it. - I don't know. Why don't you want to think about it? We'll leave as soon as we can. Somewhere. In fact that's no solution. Do you really want to live with this whore? She's not a whore. Are you blind as well? Not really, because I see things too. - I see her go out with men. - Why not now? Because you are in the house. Why does she always come back at night? Because now that I'm working, she does less overtime. She doesn't have to. I'm looking after the kid. - And it isn't her who sent you money. - Who then? - Where is this money? - I spent it. - How? - How what? - How did you spend it? - On drink. - On what? - On lots of things. - That can't be true. - But I tell you it is. You're not thinking clearly. To my way of thinking Iren is neither a wife, nor a mother You don't believe us, instead you believe this whore? Until I'm really sure, I can't do anything. Why don't you keep a watch on her? I'll try. I tried before as well. What? That's not true. I don't have time. I'm working too. Always so trusting! You can't ignore facts. The other day when you thought... she was doing overtime, why didn't you go to the factory? Because I didn't have the time. I came back late. Take a day off, follow her, find out what she's up to. I wouldn't want to go as far as that. But you'd believe Satan himself! Besides, I also noticed that you yourself... ...are always out with your buddies. - You're exaggerating a bit. Perhaps that's why your wife does it. But what you can do, she must not! You're a man, and she's only a woman. I will not allow our family name to be dishonoured by my son. It's shameful what you are doing. I've worked here since 1973... and the Supreme Court forced us out of the appartment... within fiteen days. But we had nowhere else to go, so we stayed with my mother-in-law. I have two children, and I'm expecting a third. One is being looked after by my mother, the other by my father-in-law. An old man took us in, but he was sub-letting from someone else. But we didn't know what was in the lease. The old man is dead, but the lease is still active. The Court judged us to be in breach of contract, but I don't know where to go. It might help if I had this appartment. Perhaps it might help if we had an appart... One room with kitchen would be enough. Just as long as I had a roof. Thanks to this old man, I've been able to take back my children. They are like strangers. I'm not married. We live apart. They go to school here, and I don't want my family to be split up. My husband works, and so do I. I've had problems with my lungs, but I've just had an operation. I'm able to work now, but nothing too heavy. We're still in the appartment, so long as we have no other choice. I don't know what's going to happen, because I'm expecting my third child in May. I have only one. My brother has one too, and his wife. They have been waiting two years for an appartment, but they always say, wait, wait. They say that they won't rent out a place for just two people. But if there is an urgent need, that can't be right? And if someone has a place without a permit, can they stay put? I don't know... what the rules are now. I still haven't received the papers from the tribunal, that's more than three weeks. We've been declared in breach of contract but we still haven't received the papers. I don't know whether they have it at the Council. This way please. You are living in a HLM? We are living with my mother-in-law. - How many of you in this appartment? - We are many. It's one room plus kitchen. That's why I'm here. If you are given an appartment how many will live there? Me, my husband and the child. Three, then. You are living in a one-room appartment, no hot water? Yes. Unfortunately we can't give you an appartment this year. According to your points, probably not next year either. It's possible that we might be able to give you, in 79 or 80, one-room with kitchen, as temporary accommodation. But I don't understand. When my husband came here last week... they told him to request an empty appartment, if we knew of one. It's illegal to do that. Nobody here said such a thing. You can't say that you know of an empty appartment. But we know such things exist, empty appartments, however... I don't understand. You might at least give us some hope. By 1980 I might be dead and buried... if we continue to live like this. My marriage will be on the rocks. I can't believe you're powerless. Excuse me... ...accommodation requests are classified in order of urgency. Here we have over 14000 requests. What would we say to the families... whose urgency index is twice yours? I know of single men who live all alone in their appartment. - We'll evict them - They've been there for over two years. That's not possible. It is possible, and those are the facts. Alright, give me their names and addresses. No, but if there was some temporary... As temporary accommodation we can offer one-room plus kitchen. Well, that would suit me, I just want to get out. We can't give temporary accommodation... to those who have already submitted an official accommodation request. We can't give you any appartment. I'm sure that you will find a solution. I understand, I understand very well, I understand everything. You there in your chair, it's easy to say. No, but I see fifty cases like yours every day. Fifty? All I am asking, is for you to try and understand what it means, not to be able... to sleep when you want, eat when you want. I am not paid to put myself in your place. Alright, but please understand... we must have something. You have made your request. Yes, and since then we've come every day. But so have 14000 others, and for the same reason. And what am I to tell them, if I accept your application for accommodation? What am I to tell them? I only ask you have some understanding... in this very difficult situation. We have accepted your accommodation request, it has been coded and stored on the computer. I don't understand. Each week they promised. Is it your impression that I am making you a promise now? No. Because now you have told me no, definitively no. That's exactly it. And while waiting, I might be run over by a tram, or I might hang myself, because my life is ruined. Those things happen. So you are telling me it's all in vain. - Here we deal with accommodation. - I see that, but please understand: Sooner or later you'll have to deal with it. Sometimes my husband will come, sometimes me. Quite useless. We only process accommodation requests once a year. Are you saying that it's entirely useless for us to come here each week? Absolutely. I must only come here once a year, and perhaps next year I might have an extra point... or maybe two. Each year the requests grow by 0.1%. But those houses, they are empty. It rains inside, they have no doors or windows, and it costs money to repair them. - But if someone could use them? - It's not a question of money. You could let them while waiting. Unfortunately I can't be of any further service to you. I believe you... but write something down, or do something. Like what? I won't write anything. I've told you what my situation is. Each week they tell me the same thing and I cry each week, and then they show me the door. And if you cry, do you think that that will help you get accommodation? And you are so proud of your social policy. Family planning, children! And then all the marriages which fail because of that. Because there is nowhere for young people to live. Even if all that is true, we still won't have more appartments. I know you have no comprehension, sitting there in that chair, and I wouldn't believe it myself, if I didn't see it with my own eyes. That's why I am asking you to come down and see how things really are. It shouldn't always have to be the concierge who comes... when there are fights and quarrels. He comes and then denounces us to the Council. Because this family is like that, because they are so many, and they can't live together. One can't go on for long under those circumstances. That's why you have come here, and made your request... to be given an appartment. - And you will have one. - Yes, I know. In 1980 or 90. When it is your turn. Not one minute sooner, or later. And these houses will continue to rot. And so will we. Because they are all empty. They won't always remain so. Yes, because they'll rot in the rain. You'd do better to give them away. One room at least. Or whatever. I already told you several times what we can and what we can't do. I can't tell you anything else for the moment. We understand your position very well, but unfortunately we can't do anything to help. That's about all I can say. I wouldn't know what to say either, if I was in your shoes. Here is your application. Next week at the same time we'll meet again... ...and I'll bore you some more. - As you wish. - Goodbye - Goodbye. You're hiding something from me. But I found a letter. - You have a child. - I know. Why didn't you tell me? Why do you hide everything from me? And in what way would it have been better if I had told you? We could have intervened, in one way or another. If the child is born, what is it to you? What are you going to do now? With the baby I mean? You can't keep it here. It's too crowded. - What are you going to do, then? - Nothing. You see, you are so irresponsible! It's not my problem anyway. It's hers! It takes two to make one, or so I believe. I wanted you, and you were born. We didn't want others, and so they were not. - Personally I don't want it. - I can well believe it. I don't want your mother to know. She's does housework... for doctors, for engineers, who kiss her hand. They respect her. It would be shameful if they came to know... that her son had had a natural child, as they say. What do you mean, a natural child? If you don't marry her, then they'll always remind him that he has no father. I'll give him my name, and that's all. - It's not as simple as that. - What should I do then? That's your business. But it's a great shame for me. - Not for me. - That's the problem. Because you talk like that. I don't agree with you. I'm ashamed when I go to the factory. - Why are you ashamed? - Because you are my son. And the neighbours will tell me that this Kovacs has children, which he doesn't look after. You take it so easily? So what? It isn't the end of the world. My dear boy. I work in a factory. They expect something of me. They like me. They appreciate me. I like the work. And I like being there. That permits me to make economies. But it's not for me, nor for your mother, but for you, for my other son, and for my grand-daughter. And you! All you want is to breed like a baby factory. And if you found another woman tomorrow, would there be another child? Would it be left in front of my door? You are 27 years old, and you refuse to act reponsibly? We brought you up right, your mother and me. We worked our fingers to the bone for you! But you! If your not screwing whores then you're screwing social security. You should die of shame. Me and your mother had a pile of trouble, bringing up you and the two others. After the factory I went to work in a private enterprise, to get more money... so as to feed and clothe you. And this is the result. We no longer have the energy. I'm 52 years old, and I'm ill, and decrepit. Don't you think it's time to give something back to your old parents? How will you live? You have to work hard, and save hard just in case... you marry a beautiful woman, and then you will have a long and happy life, just like your mother and me have had over 28 years. Don't you think? A balanced life, in harmony. Try and be like your old mum and dad. Lie back, dear. Put that under so it won't be cold. Don't be afraid, it's just a little prick. Lift your feet, put your hands there, breathe deep. Up. Turn Say "Ah". Krisztike, it won't hurt. I won't use the spatula if you open wide. Very good. Say "Ah" now. Louder. If I can see, I won't have to use the spatula. Very good. What a good girl. Well, this child, as usual, has problems with her lungs. When was she last in hospital? In 73, with the same problem. - Since then, it happens frequently. - Yes, quite often. Unfortunately it always comes back. Pipe down, Krisztike, so I can talk with your mother. She'll have to take an expectorant. Give it to her three times a day. Then a capsule... which you can give her each evening, dissolved in black tea. I know it's always very good. Also it's very important... that she should be out in the sun, in the fresh air. Take a trip each Sunday to the Buda mountains. We go there with the kindy. You must take mummy too, on Saturday or Sunday. When you have the time. There the air is pure. - Mum doesn't know where it is. - The doctor told you: Ssh! This is very important. We have already discussed it, remember? She has already been in hospital with that, and in the sanitorium too. Try and fix your housing problem too. Try and get out. - There. - Thankyou very much. Krisztike, say goodbye. And come back in three days. If she gets worse... come back tomorrow. If not, in three days, when she's finished the medicine. - Who made that? - Jancsika. He came back from school with it. You have to glue it. Already, on the first day, he did it. He was helping to stick it on the wall, but, as usual, he rushed things and he broke it. The teacher sent him home saying that it should be put on glass. But I don't see how. Glass on glass, I don't understand. The picture is torn as well. You can't simply put it on a glass. My dear girl, not like that. Try it like that, but don't put it on the back. - But yes, so that it sticks. - The paper, that's no problem. I'm going to cut my hand. I'll try it like that. There you are. Good. Good, now press it a little. Good, like that. - Good, wait. - It was his first day at school! You should tell the child to pay attention. He's so thoughtless. I have told him, but what can I do, now. Do you realize, if we had to buy a new one it would cost us 320 crowns. - I don't have the money for that. - I'm going to try and glue it... but we must wait 24 hours at least. - Lift that, yes. - Let's hope it works then. The teacher said that we need a new glass. But I don't understand how. We can't put it on the back either because the split will show. And the whole picture is stuck on the glass. In that case we can only... glue it like that. I was very nervous when I saw it, but he was with his friend... who said that it happened by chance. Lucky that he didn't do it purpose. - Yes. - First day at school! What will happen next? However it's the prize ornament in the schoolroom. It always has pride of place. I couldn't do otherwise. We have to scrape off the glue now, so that it doesn't show... because once it dries, we'll never get it off. You know how to fix everything. It's incredible. There, that should do it. Oh, it sticks perfectly! It should be OK like that. I won't give you a penny. Not a penny. Don't always come here asking for money. I don't get respect from you, just insults. But otherwise we can't leave. Why haven't you saved up? You've had five years to save up what you need. You only know how to dress up and have fun. - Oh, really! - How much do you earn? Very little. And do they pay me a fortune? Should I be giving you a tithe? I've been a soldier for two years? What else could she do? That's not my affair, the army. Other honest women... You had discounts, after all. Exactly. Your wife sould have been able to economise. I fed her, housed her. I paid for my grand-daughter's kindergarten. What did she do with the money? She came back at night. She always said she had overtime. - And that wasn't true? - It wasn't true. - You were there? - I had you followed. You didn't do it yourself? Why did you have me followed? I saw you many times with men on this side, on that side. - Don't talk to my wife like that. - And when payday came around... you always said that there was less... because there were all sorts of bills to pay. What bills? What do you mean, less? I've never told you how much I earn. I came here for help. But where is your money? Where is it? You never do your accounts. - She spends it on the child, and on me. - Oh, really? You were a soldier, supported by the army. And me, I brought up my grand-daughter, I bought her clothes, and I often paid for you as well. It doesn't concern me what you're saying. I've come here now to borrow money so we can leave. But you won't do that at my expense! No matter what it costs you, I'm not paying! What right do you have to demand to see my accounts? - Be quiet, you too. - Why should I be quiet? I have the right because you live here. Enough, he can't talk about anything else. I wanted you to have a bit of money when my son finished his service. So that you could leave. There are three families living here. And that's why I want to leave, and why I'm asking for your help. If you really want us to leave. No question of that. But you'll get by, just as you always have up till now. When I asked you for rent money, always very politely, because your mother was ill and wasn't earning, and because I also have dependents, and bills to pay. But you just laughed at me. I never asked you how you spend your money, nor my mother. - None of your business. - Where is your salary? You earn 3500 crowns, I found out. You came back with a false pay slip. If only that were true. Perhaps you earn that much, but I certainly don't. - Really? - Yes. Your pay is perhaps 3500 crowns. - Why are you lying to me? Why? - How come you know how much I earn? I know lots of things. When you have overtime, for instance. And why were you walking with Joska, hand in hand? Your child was crying for her mother. She works "overtime". Whore. You are a whore. - Whore. You are a whore. - It's not to your wife that you're talking. - Have you no shame? You... - No. Softly. Talk more softly. Where were you? You're asking me that as well? I was working. What a question! - Can you prove it? Why not? What's the matter with you? Are you siding with your father? - I know what I know. - You don't believe me either? Do you always believe rumour and gossip? I mean that you weren't at home during the night. Where have you been sleeping all these months? You always say that you finish late at the abbatoir. That you miss the last tram, and that you stay with yor friend. Don't you? Your child asked me all night through where his mother was. I told her that you were working overtime. With your friends! You were enjoying yourself all night. And you left me with your kid. And you gave your money to your friends. With whom you took your pleasure. You know how much that comes to, for you both? You owe me at least 20,000 crowns. When you have paid that, you can leave. Tell me, where were you, those nights? - You don't believe me either? - She's lying? - You don't believe me? - No. - How can I prove it to you? - With the pay slips. But how? What will the pay slips prove? Go and ask where I was. Alright, I'll go and get the pay slips. They're at the factory. - Why aren't they here? - You listen to your father, and not to me? What I understand, is that at night you were not in the house. He didn't see me. He forgot to put on his specs. Ask him where I was. At night, when I went to the toilet, your bed was empty. This is what I am asking you: Where were you at night? - Here. In the house. - How many times did your mother try and hide it! Not once. Not a single time, because I was always in the house... ...only it seems you forgot to check. And you, if you'd rather believe your father, well... - You don't have to believe me. - No. I believe you, but I believe him too. Almost. - Almost, only? - Yes. Prove it. It's for you to prove it. I have been alone for two years. Where do you suppose I could go? - Where were you at night? - Where could I have been? When I'm trapped with people like these, do you think I would dare to go out? Aha, now we're "people"! You're calling us "people" now? - Why? Isn't it true? - You know what I'm going to say? Leave. You will leave this house. And straight away. - I will, and I'll take the child. - Take your belongings, those you have... ...but you won't take my grand-daughter. - Yes I will. And you can go and fuck your daddy. What is yours you can take. But you leave the child. - You will not take the child. - Oh yes, I will. I am taking her. You will leave her here. You will not take her. Filthy bitch. You want to destroy your child as well. She wastes money like it was toilet paper. She spends it all elsewhere. And it wasn't her who sent you money in the army... ...it was me. - Your father, of course. - You're as blind as a bat. - You will only take what belongs to you. - No. I'm taking the child as well. No, not her. You can't take her. She stays here. - I'm taking her. - Let me go. - The child is mine, and mine only. - That's not true. You are not a mother. At night she is not yours. A prostitute shall not take away my grand-daughter. I swear to you that you won't take her! Stay, and sit down, OK? I cried yesterday, and the day before, and now I can't anymore. I don't know what's going to happen. The child is alright, she's staying with my brother... but I need some place where I can be alone. After that, I don't know, I suppose something will turn up. But now, it's so horrible, and I'm so alone. Just one room would be enough, or anything, share with somebody. Because now I'm sleeping here and there, I don't know where to go. And it's so bad. We had problems in the past. We've been married for seven years... ...but this time it seems so final. And we've never been separated, only now. That's why it's so difficult. I can't imagine my life without him. Perhaps we'll get back together when I on my own, you know? It's certainly because of that. I'm sure that if we were just two, on our own together, it would be different. It's certainly all because of that. I can't go on. If you can, please try and help me. Anything would help, even if it's at the end of the world. In the meantime, it would certainly help... and I would be calmer, and perhaps he would understand... that it's better to be two, and pay a rental. And there wouldn't always be that crowd looking at us, what we're doing, how we're doing it, and when. Why we close the door, why we don't open it... and so on, and so on. It's hard like that. And it's not easy at the factory, either. I'm tense, pretending all day so they don't see how it is, and when I leave, I can only weep. No, it's not easy there. You know, if one doesn't have money, one is ashamed to admit it, and it ruins everything. For example, if I didn't come back on time they said straight out that it was for... one reason only. But I was doing overtime, I was working like a slave. If I didn't visit my mother, that was for another reason. It's easily explained. We argued a lot recently. But nobody realized. It's not their business. I don't think I need to explain to you. When I couldn't go to the baracks they immediately asked why. Nobody ever gave me any money. Not a penny. We argued over trivia. First, because of the child. That I spoiled her, because already since December I'd had the child, and I let her do whatever she wanted. But he never hit her. Because I was her mother. Then, all the years we spent together. When I came back he went out to the pub. Then, when I asked him... what I should do around the house, he replied that it wasn't my place. So, I didn't know what to think. But even if I stay alone all my life that doesn't worry me. It would certainly be better like that. We were in love... You can't just walk away from someone like that. After all he is my child's father. I don't know what's going to happen. Why aren't you drinking? It's going to be hot. Sorry, that's the way it is. Dear Vali, let's have a drink. Just one drink. We'll be liberated. We can talk freely. What are you afraid of? I can see your heart beating. My heart is beating too. You please me, dear Vali. You please me greatly, dear Vali. Drink, drink. Be of good cheer. The night is young. Let's enjoy life, don't be sad. Come, come, let's be happy. You don't want to? Why not? What is causing you pain? - Are you afraid of me? - Why, no. I could have had my choice of so many women... but you're the only one who pleases me. Come, do you want a Chevrolet? A Polski, or a Fiat? My darling. - Excuse me, no. - Why not? - Don't get angry with me. - But I want to go. I want to be happy. Just one evening. A beautiful evening. You have a wife, two children. But I want to start out afresh. - Not with me. - Who with then? I can't love the whole world. I know that there is a strong attraction between us. But I won't breathe a word to anyone. I beg you, dear Vali, I beg you. - I love you so much - Calm down then. I wouldn't have believed it. To drop me like that. By what right? Why? I don't love you. I don't understand. I love you, I love you not. We'll have fun, a good time, a little romance. That's life. I would like to have had a wife like you. One beautiful evening. Don't refuse me. Don't refuse me. - Do you want? - No. Why not? Darling Vali! To say things like that to me. - Kiss me. - I'm going. Don't annoy me. Don't annoy me. I don't know what I'm saying. - I want to kiss you. - Don't get familiar. - let me kiss your your mouth. - Calm down, or I'll leave. Me? I've never been turned down by a woman. But I'll turn you down. - I also have my preferences. - No. You're not normal. No-one is normal in a situation like this. - I beg you. - Leave me alone, or I'm going. Don't do that to me. I love you so much. Come, come to me. - You love me? - Never! You also know how to be wild, hmm? You know what? I hate you! - Me? - And you can't imagine how much. Hate? Me? You're going to be sorry. - You'll cry whem I'm gone. - For what reason? Cry after you? - Don't play the little flirt. - I'm not. Be happy, that you have a man like me.... ...who even owns a motor car. - That doesn't interest me. Do you want a Marlboro? I'm going home. I don't even want to touch your hand. Why didn't you leave before? Because I felt fine before you arrived. But not after. - Really? - Exactly. Well, why didn't you inform me of it, may I ask? I would have let you go. I am a man. I have certain needs. Give me your hand. Let me go. Whore. I've never been treated like that before. "My mother struggled to raise me She worked day and night Ah! Her life was hard. But when I came home, the sky was open on all sides, and the stars looked down, but they didn't know that I was an orphan." My God! You're a good chap! And me then? "And the stars looked down, but they didn't know, that I was an orphan." I hope that they'll let me stay. I really hope so. I don't know why, but there are so many people here. 70% of young people come in for the night. And they've stayed. Like me too, since last month. And they say that if the police don't evict them within 48 houes... then no-one will disturb them. It's even happened that the residents threw someone out. Then he complained to the concierge who came with someone else. Obviously they both have accommodation. They removed all the doors. There's only only one left. It's nailed shut now. They simply can't imagine that people can't find somewhere to live. And they think that they are the Council. This man arrived with the concierge, he has an appartment, and even a dog. Even so, he helped him remove the doors. He even wanted to take away the bed. But I wouldn't let him do that. There is only one door left, but I believe that that's by chance. And this door is nailed shut, you can't go through. There's no lock, but inside... it's nailed down with planks. Here there is only the window. But there also when you want to walk a bit. Sure. There's the door, and the window. Both. People are like that. And he doesn't even live in the house. That's the weird part. He's been known to help the concierge... using his dog, so as to frighten people. And he succeeded, because if a child sees a dog he'll start to cry straight away. But I don't know where to keep my kid. I have no official residence, I don't want to put her in an institute or worse. One has children so as to live with them, to bring them up, to be happy with them. But not like that. First because there are 14 living in that appartment, and second because the doors are all broken. Then, because they don't have a roof over their heads, they squat in an appartment, and they don't know what's going to happen. Young people should be able to get married, have a family, and be happy. But for us all that is nonsense. We exist because we are wanted. One is so happy with a child! When we are sad, a child makes us happy. They are so gentle. And all this social policy nonsense, that they talk about all the time! One doesn't bring children into the world... just to increase the population. But because they are wanted, too. And it is so good when one has a child whom one loves, and for whom one does all one can. Me too, I can't sleep in the street, can I? And if it rains, or if there is a storm, what am I going to do? I can't tell her that I have no place to stay. If I had a place that would be so marvellous! But if I have to sleep one month, or one year on the ground, with no bed or other furniture. And... That would be marvellous! I don't know. I wouldn't know what to do, I'd be so happy. I'd certainly kiss the walls. It would be so great if I had an appartment. Even if I did have to sleep one month, or one year on the ground, without furniture. Because I'd know that it was mine, and only I would have the right to enter there, and no-one else. I am sure that is what will happen. And little by little I'll buy the furniture. I'll ask for a loan... ... from the factory. I don't know. I 'm sure that life can be beautiful. It was in January 1971. My wife was very happy. Because she had parents... who gave her nothing, but rather took everything from her. We bought her a coat on credit. A winter coat. She was so happy. She kept on repeating day after day... that she'd never owned such a beautiful coat. The following month I bought her a pair of boots for 800 crowns. And again she said that she had never had such boots. She couldn't, because her mother took her money. And I was happy too, to be able to buy her something. She was always in debt at that time, because she was supporting her mother. She could never buy anything for herself... because she was spending it all on her mother. She had a nervous breakdown... ...but she recovered. And now? She sublets from my father. It's the same as before. She is still sick. Just the same as in the beginning. Her hands and legs are shaking all the time. She is at the end of her tether. She wanted to leave, and she did. I don't know if she had anywhere to go. If only I had an appartment, and I will have one soon, that's for sure... I'll take Krisztike, and she will come too, She will come because she loves me. I know that. She often deceived me, but I love her in spite of that. I've never harmed her. During the six years of our marriage, I only hit her, perhaps, twice. That's not much, really. I have lots of faults. I used to drink too much... before the army. One week before the army I made a decision... not to drink any more. I only drank low alchohol... but I still stayed at the bar until she came home. When I was released it all began again. But perhaps I drink a bit less now. Since she left... ...nothing interests me. I go out to drink, I come back. I had problems in the army, too. Most recently, because of her. At the beginning, because of me. She was right. It was because of the drink. But the last one was because I already knew... ...that she went out at night, and she didn't always came back. Once, when I came back on leave... she wasn't in the house. She wasn't in the house. I was in the house. I folded over a corner of the sheet. Next day I came back out of curiosity. And I asked her if she had slept in the house the previous night. She said yes. Then I said to her that it wasn't true. Because I knew. The corner of the sheet... was just as I had left it. That's how I found out. That's the only possible conclusion. If we only had our own place we could start over. Which would belong to us. Which we could both furnish. And not an endless argument about when and where to live. When they were fed up up with us. When I was in the army they spied on her to find out what she was doing. She came back from work, she picked up the child... and then she went shopping. They spied on her, but of course... in such a way that she was unaware of it. It was too much for her, I think. Or else, she had a lover. Perhaps that's why she left. I can understand that it was all too much, my father harassed her too... ...in a bizarre fashion. He caressed her at night under the sheet. Once she whacked him with her shoe. Nobody knows about that in my family. No, the accommodation wasn't the best. And I love her, and she loves me. I'm sure of it. 100% sure. And if even she does have a lover, that doesn't worry me. If I have an appartment, she will come back. I'm sure of it. Want to bet? She will come back. When our house is ready... You will be our first guest If you come in the evening we will dine together... and you can sleep in our spare room. We will watch over your dreams. And while you sleep your dreams will come true. It will be such a nice little house. We will always have plenty of friends. We will all sing sentimental songs... ...when our house is ready.
