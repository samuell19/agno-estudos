TV Channel Russia CTB Film Company With Amselfilm Productions Sergey Garmash Vladimir Gusev Pyotr Logachev Don't even think about it. Dump it further away. Marina Alexandrova Aleksei Guskov Anton Shagin What the hell are you doing? I slipped It was freezing last night. You still don't know how to heat the place. Vladimir Petrovich! What will I do if I meet the Yeti? How could you meet him? You never go further than the garbage. What if he comes to eat our leftovers? Piss off! Idiot. THE WEATHER STATION - Hey Kolya - Hey No sleep last night? You look awful. Drank too much. - What's up? - We don't know. We got a garbled SOS message last night. But there's no-one here. Seems like the weather men just disappeared. I'll take the helicopter and check out the plateau. Hello, Andrey Vladimirovich. We haven't found much, but there are some interesting things. Were they shot? Yeah, God knows why Maybe there were hungry? There's plenty of food in the station. Take photos of them. TWO DAYS BEFORE Hello, Mashenka. - How are you up there? - Everything's fine. I'm ready 34.471. Yeah. 7.823 Romaha! Since you arrived, all the sweet milk's gone missing. Did they not give you anything sweet in the orphanage, huh? Not going to answer me? Romaha. I'm not Romaha - Who are you then? - Romash Yesterday I reached the 2nd level of the Eiffel tower Well done. It'll be ready next month. Slava, I have some bad news for you. What news? So Romash, were you a follower or a leader at the orphanage? A leader. One of the cool guys, huh? You're not cool. You're an oddball. Always hiding everywhere. In the navy, you'd be called a Rat. They're closing down the station. Masha just told me. - What? - They've sold the land. What do you mean? They sold it last month. And they're converting it into a hostel. You knew? You're getting the chop. And I'm staying on as chef. Bastards! They've sold us! Sold us out, bitches!! Have you gone mad? What the hell are you doing? They sold us out, the bastards! - Stop it! Do you hear me? - Romaha! Throw the bird on the garbage. - I'm not your dog. - Just do it, don't mess around. What'd I tell you?! - Are you completely mad!? - Go on! Go on! Go! Get a move on! Idiot! Go on! Go on! Their office is downstairs. The living area upstairs. There's no sign of a struggle except for the broken radio. And these? ...and these bullet holes From a handgun? Yeah, a Makarov. They were only licensed for a rifle. One of them must have hidden it. Or they had a visitor. There were two meteorologists in the Weather Station plus a 19-year-old boy. All they had to do was take measurements and report them a few times a day. Had the boy been here long? Only 2 months. The head meteorologist is Ivanov. 10 years of flawless service. Head of the weather service said he was very reliable. - You'd go mad living here. - Maybe that's what happened? The boy took care of the place He was the cook and the general handyman. - Was he a qualified cook? - He's from an orphanage - probably took a course there. - What's his name? Roman Shilov. Apparently, he caused a lot of trouble at the orphanage. The director described him as conceited, vindictive and ruthless. Sound like the perfect housemate. The other meteorologist is Drozdov, Vladimir Petrovich. 50 years old. Unmarried. Just like Ivanov. He's been here for 7 years. He's actually highly qualified. Even more so than Ivanov, who's his boss. He's been everywhere from the Urals to the Far East. What's this he's left behind? You'd kill a bear with one of these. What could he be hunting? Huh? There's nothing here! - What's that? - A yeti. - What? - A Yeti. It's a giant snowman One of Drozdov's hobbies. Strange, but Drozdov's supposed to be a normal guy. All this story needs is a Yeti. Has he recovered yet? He's not there. Probably scurrying around the place like a cockroach. We have to do something. We should write a letter. They can't just do this. It's illegal. Write to whom? To the Science Academy. After all, science is the reason we're here. I don't know. Maybe to the governor. The academy sold us out! And the governor's probably in on the deal. So we just do nothing? Slava, you think they care about us? They couldn't give a shit! Let them rot in hell. The pigs. Kolya, found anything? Nothing on the plateau. There's something else, though. Two tourists have gone missing around here. - Who are they? - A couple called Penkovsky He's some kind of big banker. The authorities are all over us because of them. The bastards should have gone to Bali with the money they have. - Anything here? - No. We've had a look. We'll do some analysis later. Time to go. It's getting dark. How many of you are coming back? - All four. There's no space for four. One has to stay. I'll stay. You guys go on! - Let me stay with you. - What for? It's risky. Something might happen Get outta here, go on. Have you gone crazy? You forgot the radio. You should have done what I said. They won't be back till the morning. At least we're in contact with them. Did it take long to get up here? - About 12 hours Was it rough? Couldn't have done it without the military jeep. I'm not surprised. The weather up here changes every minute. We wanted to come up by foot, but you'd need a week. Well, we rarely have guests. Even mountaineers don't come here. Come on in. The only visitor we get is our monthly supply man. Ever feel like escaping? We've gotten used to it somehow - Just the two of you here? - There was five of us. They got rid of three. Now there's just us two. Romash and him Vadim - Irina - Romash. How was your trip? - Fine, thank you. - OK choir boy. Go make the fire and lay the table. - Please, sit down. - I brought come cognac Great! We'll celebrate your visit. Where are you off to? We're going to a cave near here in the morning. Are you speleologists? Just amateurs. We went caving around here a few years ago. And our trip evolved into 5 years of marriage. We want to have our anniversary in the same cave. Can we spent the night here? I'm happy to pay. No need to pay. Just relax. You can sleep in the boy's room. He'll sleep out in the generator room. I just spoke to the Mountain Rangers. They won't be back tonight. Maybe not even tomorrow. - They're expecting thick fog. - Serves you right. I was right not to leave you alone. Well, just get that generator going. Andrey Vladimirovich! Look. I'll check it out. It's a bit like a prison. Maybe they held the Penkovskys here? "Around the World". You think they gave them magazines to read? - Why not? - Fried sweet milk... We ate this stuff in the scouts. Tastes great heated on the fire. There's something drawn here. - Where? - There. It's a tree. I think I've seen it before. Where? I don't know, but I'm sure I have. What was the boy's name again? Roman Shilov. Shilov? - I think I've heard of him. - Oh yeah? 14 years ago a police colonel named Shilov was killed at home with his wife. The killer didn't see their 5-year-old son. The kid spent two days with his parents' bodies before they were discovered. And then he was sent to an orphanage? I guess so What if it's the same kid? It means we're dealing with someone severely emotionally scarred. So, we have the matchstick sculptor, the yeti fantasist, and the kid who saw his parents killed. Do you think the weather service considered their psychological compatibility? I guess not. So, you're the cook? I'm the head housekeeper. Like Cinderella? More like a ghost. Been here long? About a month, why? - Need a hand? - No, I'll manage. - What are you doing? - Check it out. What's up there? The transmitter Hasn't been used for 15 years Looks like the lock hasn't been opened since. Look... there's that tree again! If we found the Yeti, it would be a worldwide sensation. We could make a lot of money. We'd just need to fund an expedition. Think about it. Ok. I'll think about it. A lot of people have tried to find him. But they're mostly amateurs. They do no research. They don't understand him. - And do you? - Yes I do. I've studied him for 20 years. Where does he lives? He lives near the caves you're visiting. Is he dangerous? He's very dangerous. You think it's funny? You don't believe me? - Let me show you something. - Vadim, maybe you shouldn't. We're getting up early tomorrow. So what's your hobby? - Listening to music. - In his little hiding place. - His hiding place? - He likes to hide. Go get some logs, invisible boy. I've photos of him, even sound recordings of his voice. Here. These are from last year. Look how big his footprints are. He must weigh over 300 kilos. Look at this. Here. I'm sorry, we need some fresh air. Stupid bastards! I'm wasting my time with them. They're just having a romantic holiday. They're rich but at least they didn't go to the south of France. - They should have gone to hell. - Come on, Volodya, Just because they're rich. We can't all be rich. They're rich because of what they stole. Why did you bring me here? Who are these people? You want to ruin everything? Why did you walk out like that? Go back in there and talk to them! - Don't tell me what to do! I agreed to go to the cave. Not this place. Please Vadim, just go in, wish them a good night. Shit! We're wasting time here. Either way, they're coming after us. Strange weather. What will it be like tomorrow? Dunno. The weather constantly changes here. Even the meteorologists don't have a clue. Why are you going to the caves? - Huh? - They're coming after me too. - What? They're coming for me too. Slava! - Did you take my rifle? - No. - What's going on? - How do I know? - Is the front door locked? - Yes. They shot someone who was behind the door. Why? It's too near to miss. The bullets would've stayed in the body, but they went through the door. It means someone was behind the door. That's logical, but unclear. Why would they want to shoot someone who was behind the door? Out of fear. Whoever was behind the door was trying to get in. - The Yeti? - Maybe. But how did they keep the door shut? Logical, but still unclear. Don't shoot! It's me! Open up! I was only joking. Idiot! - What did you think you were doing? You halfwit! You stupid bloody halfwit! - What if he shot you? - Don't you understand a joke? What? You call that a joke!? Cockroach! Where are you going? What's so funny? Huh? What if he shot his head off? Where did you get the gun? I've a license for it. Slava! - Don't move! - Don't shoot. It's me! - What are you doing? - I'm running. It's cold. - What are you shooting for? - So you could find me! I thought I heard someone so I came out to look, and I got lost. I tried shouting. But had to shoot the gun to signal to you. Andrey Vladimirovich, lets go back. Andrey Vladimirovich! You're the real thing. - You're a true professional - Thanks. The way you figured out the door! When I was a kid, I used to dream about being an investigator. What a bizarre dream! - I imagined being just like you. You're my mentor. To you. You might as well have become an undertaker. Everyone dies. It's natural. Those we deal with die unnaturally. Help! What's wrong? What happened? Where's Vadim? - Don't just stand there, help me! - What's wrong with her? - How the hell do I know?! Irina. What happened? Irina, where's Vadim? Her arm might be broken Vadim's dead How? We were attacked in the cave. Who attacked you? Did you see them? They came from behind. Vadim fell into a pit. This will help her sleep. Here, drink it. Could it have been the Yeti? We need to go there and see. At night? Are you crazy? What if he's still alive? She said he fell somewhere. Maybe he's not dead. We should call the mountain rangers. They won't get here till the morning - She's OK. She's asleep. - This is a disaster! First the gunshots. And now this! We don't have to tell anyone about the gunshots, OK? What are you sneering at? Let's move her to Romash's room. Come on. The radio's broken. Where's the lamp? What? Where did you put it? I didn't touch anything! It was either you or her. How could I have unscrewed the lid in that time? It's been unscrewed for ages!! Put your hands up. Come on. Maybe you'd like to give her a full body search too? Someone has to go to the cave. We'll get our answers there. - Nobody is going anywhere! - I'm going. I said no! Don't forget, I'm the boss here! Come on, Slava, what kind of boss are you really? Nobody is leaving this place. Confess all and we'll forgive you, Vyacheslav Igorevich. Shut up! Want me to put on some music for you? - Have you got a light? - Yeah. - Does it hurt? - It's not too bad. What are they doing about the radio? - How did you know about that? - I could hear them. So you weren't asleep? Wait. What's gonna happen now? I'm scared. I don't know. Drozdov's gone to the cave. My husband ripped off some serious people and transferred the money overseas. We were going to leave the country. We wanted to disappear in the mountains so no-one would come looking for us. Myself and Vadim havn't been lovers for a long time. Whatever we had was over as soon as it began. and now he's lying there. Here we are at the fireplace. just like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. What would they think of all this? Maybe everyone's alive and well And it'll all turn out to be a big mistake. Or there'll be no witnesses, investigators will spend years trying to figure it out. My dear Holmes, please explain your train of thought. Think about it. A beautiful woman comes up here. Madame Penkovsky. And there's a 19-year-old boy here. So what do you think happened? The 30-year-old woman arrives. And there's a kid here. And? - They have sex. - And? And they kill her husband. Bravo! Slava! I just came back from the cave and I have some questions. What questions? Why are there are no tracks? No tracks at all? How would I know? Where's the boy? - Probably out in the generator room. Without his jacket? Who do you think you are? I already told you we were attacked. How did you manage to get away? - I ran away. - Did they chase you? - I don't know. Somebody hit me on the shoulder. Very hard. I fell. Then I heard Vadim screaming. He fell into the pit. I escaped and just kept running. Your husband was lying in a 10-meter pit. And you didn't even check to see if he's alive? I was scared. And what's this? It's Vadim's knife. You think the Yeti stabbed Vadim with a knife? Look at it. It's covered in blood - Maybe you know better! - Maybe I do. I've been studying the Yeti for 20 years, but I've never heard he can use a knife. - Leave me alone! - I'll leave you alone if we come to an arrangement. What arrangement? Take it easy, Slava. I'll explain later. No-one will ever find your husband's body. He was in the mountains. He disappeared. That's all. Think about it. I'll give you till the morning. Let's go You killed him, didn't you? Slava! This is our chance. She killed him. It's as clear as day. And she broke the radio. It's all playing right into our hands. We'll hide the body and keep the knife as evidence, so she won't cheat us. - That's helping a murderer! - What do you mean helping? Did you see anything? Did you see her kill her husband? We just have to be calm. That's all! Everything will be fine. But maybe it wasn't her? Maybe it was the Yeti? The Yeti? Slava. There is no Yeti. He doesn't exist! What do you mean? He only exists in here, where I made him up! - But what about the tracks? - The tracks? I did them myself. I'm the Yeti! I didn't mean to kill him. It was self-defence. He was psychotic - he attacked me. He was shouting that he didn't need me anymore. I said it wasn't so easy to get rid of me. Then he grabbed me. I could feel the knife in his belt. I stabbed him, threw him off. He fell into the pit. So what happened you? When I was 5, a man came into our House and killed my parents. But he didn't find me. He will find me though. Definitely. We should both go away. Abroad. Together? Don't you trust me? You've wasted 20 years on it. Why? Why? I have no idea what I spent my life doing and why. You've been making this crap for 20 years! - Put it back! - Why? - Have you been to Paris? - No Have you seen The Eiffel Tower? - No Well, now you can see it. If we make that bitch pay up. You're retiring soon. Where will you go? To your daughter, who's seen you twice in her whole life? We've toiled our whole lives for those bastards. And she's one of them! And now they're sending us to the rubbish dump! Do you want to go to the rubbish dump? What about the boy? Stubborn little runt. What if he also fell into the pit? Don't be afraid, no one will find us here. Why did you return to the weather station? For you Tell me the truth. I have to know. There's $40,000 in cash in Vadim's pocket I can't get it, but you can. That's all you had? No. We had a safety deposit box in a bank We need two electronic keys to open it. The other one is hanging around his neck You want me to get it? You can't imagine how much money there is in that bank. We can be free. We can live wherever we want. Together. Romash, is that you? Slava! Romash! You're doing my head in with your games. If you don't come out, I'll rip your head off. Masha Masha Masha! Masha! It's the station. Masha, we have a problem. Romash Romash! - What's going on? - Come on. I'll show you. Everything OK? - Yes - Let's go We'll take the bodies to the cave. And leave the impression that everyone just disappeared. We're running out of time. Start with the door. Lets go. Are you ready? The weather keeps changing but we're still stuck in the fog. All we have are unexplained clues: The washing machine in the dining room, The tree which he drew everywhere. I've seen it somewhere. Definitely. Have a taste. Let's stoke up a banya, Andrey Vladimirovich? 12 years ago a police colonel Shilov was killed at his dacha with his wife. The killer didn't see their 5-year-old son. I'll go make the fire. Are you cold? It's warmer down there I'll bring the bodies in. Give me the rope. I'll climb down to him. I'll get the key, and we'll leave when its dark. Thank you. - Don't move! - Seryozha! - You're alive. - Where's Vadim? - Down there. - Put the torch away! - Who's he? - He's from the weather station. Hands against the wall - both of you! - Seryozha, I... Against the wall! Right now! Don't move. - Hands up! - I'll explain it to you Everything went wrong. I can see that. Put your hands up! Turn around. Tell me what happened. - Put down your gun - Stand still. Put it down! I'm not joking! - Where were you? - I got lost! I slept rough for two nights like a tramp! What happened you? We spent the night at the station and came here in the morning. Everything went according to plan, until I realized you weren't here. I had to do it myself. You killed him yourself? And who are they? They're the meteorologists. He did it. - Did you sleep with him? - Seryozha! Andrey Vladimirovich! Andrey Vladimirovich! Is the weather affecting you? What's gotten into you? Nothing's gotten into me I just remembered When I mentioned the banya, I remembered. He knew your birthmark. That's why he drew it everywhere. I used to send him money You know yourself what kind of a salary I have. I'd scrape money together for his birthday and New Years. I did it every year until he was 17. Then he left the orphanage, and I lost track of him. Who cares about the money? You killed his parents! I worked with his father. The boy was left alone. It was my duty to help him. The colonel got caught up in the crime wars. It's hard to explain, Slava. The world's bad. Just get the key and the money and come straight back. Anything goes wrong, I'll leave you down there. And if everything goes right? Get going. I trusted you. You were like a father to me. Slava, we all trust somebody sometimes. - I trusted you! - Put the gun down. Your arms will get tired. You hear me? I trusted you! It was only the colonel I was after. I didn't know his family was there. But I didn't find the boy. I was in charge of the case. I questioned him later. He said he saw nothing. Then two months ago I met him in a cafe and I realized. - Major. - He saw everything! - Major! - He knew everything. And I sent him all that money. Hand over the gun... or I'll shoot. Hold on a second. I have to think. Let me think about it, Slava. - It's not going to work. - What? Hand it over! The money. - OK. That's it. - Wait! - What? - There's more money Hand it over. Put the gun down. Put it down! Don't shoot! There's a first aid kit in the rucksack. We have to return to the station. A rescue team will be there soon. They'll rescue us and then they'll put us away. We'll blame it on Seryozha, don't you see? That won't work, Romash. Why didn't you tell me about him? I thought he'd abandoned me In the end everyone does. Don't abandon me, Romash. Promise you won't abandon me. Get rid of them. Don't you understand? I didn't kill the old men It was him. If you don't come out, I'll rip your head off! He came to kill me, but again he didn't find me. The old meteorologists just got in his way. You were in the basement. If he had found you, he'd have killed you too. That's why I hid you. I knew he would never give up. He was always going to come and get me in the end. I've spent my life running from him. But now I'm ready to face him. Irina. Is that you, my boy? Yes. Where's madame Penkovskaya? She's dead. I'd really like to see you. What for? Your father was a great man. I learnt a lot from him. He taught me how to kill with purpose. Then why did you kill him? I had to choose between my death and his. And I chose the latter. It was a choice I couldn't escape. Same with you, Roma. You can't escape it either. You're wrong. There's one place where you'll never get me. Romash. Romash. Romash The washing machine. Exactly.
