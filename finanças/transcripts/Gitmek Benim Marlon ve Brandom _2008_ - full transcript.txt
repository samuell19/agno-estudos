Go away, kids! Keep clear of this area, Yasemin. Put your handycam away, Hama Ali. We're starting. Hama Ali. Is that a storm, George? Yes Jill, and that's an understatement. It's so enormous that... Grade nine. All these tornadoes, twisters, cyclones... Yes, all these whirlwinds came from the East, dear spectators... ...only winds from the East. We have a disaster here: The penguins from the pole and the mice from the desert... ...who lived together for several years, are covered with petrol. Okay, stop. What you are doing is not clear. When you come forward to the front of the stage, you have to be much clearer. When the lights change you have to start the play. But most importantly, stop this over-acting. Another day done. What's wrong? Nothing really. Any news from Hama Ali? I keep calling all the time but can't get through. I don't understand what makes him so interesting. We should find you someone here. So I should be like you and get a new man each week? What's wrong with that? Nothing. But I'm not that kind of woman. Are you coming to the demonstration? Oh. Was it today? I met a guy on the internet. How could you? - He's 2 years younger than me! "MURDERERS USA - GET OFF THE MIDDLE EAST!" "GEORGE BUSH - YOU ARE A TERRORIST!" Good morning, Serkan. - Good morning, ma'am. Is there anything for me? - No ma'am, the postman hasn't come yet. Thanks anyway. Have a good day. America's Finger is on the Trigger USA Poised for Attack George, they burned down everything. There is nothing left. And to be sure of that, they even burned the tiny bit that was left... Where we were, dear spectators, people were literally buried. We saw it with our own eyes... Ayça... ...you're making too many gestures. You're using your eyes and hands too much. You don't need to. And now I've said this, you probably won't make any gestures at all. Come on Ayça, pull yourself together. Today a German spokesman said that Germany and France are against the war. Having contributed 2 billion Euros to world peace efforts... ...they will not be joining the Americans in their invasion of Iraq. If there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq... ...other peaceful methods should be used to resolve the problem. Mahir? What's happened? - They've cut off the water again. What are we going to do? We have a show this weekend. How can people use the washrooms? - How should I know, Ayça? Alright. We'll find a solution. Go and put something on or you'll get cold. Hello. How are you? Miss Ayça, I've got a package for you. Take it. - No, you're our neighbour. No, take it. There will be more packages coming. Thanks, Miss Ayça. Why always me? Why? I forgot to ask yesterday. Was Hama Ali in a Turkish movie? Yes, we were in the same movie. I met him on the set of that movie. Hama Ali was in Yellow Days? - Yes. Serkan told me. We had a drink together two days ago. So you only spent 25 days with him? Yes. He sent me a video love letter, you know. You told me the post doesn't work over there. So how did he send it? He gave it to a truck driver. The point is he sent it to me. And so, what's the big deal? It doesn't matter. Alright, I won't probe further. And anyway my internet lover is waiting outside. So, I'm off. Goodbye. I'm looking for a Kurdish dictionary. Yes, it's this one. We have this and also a smaller one. - A smaller one is better. Where are you from? - Istanbul. Are you Kurdish? - No, I'm not. Why do you ask? No, it's just interesting. Sorry to disturb you. I want to ask you something. I want to go to Northern Iraq. Is there anybody here who knows how to get there? Brother Soran, meet my friend. She has some questions for you. Hello. - Hi. Ayça. - Soran. The brother says you're from Northern Iraq. That's right. And where in Northern Iraq are you from? - From Suleymaniye. Really? Very good. When did you come here? Almost two years ago. I have a problem. I want to go to Suleymaniye. You know the situation... I don't know the safest way. Can you help me? I don't know how I can help you. If you want... ...I will try to find out... ...and then let you know, okay? - Okay. What do you do? I am a painter. Like this... ...and these. Did you paint this? Really? - Yes. They are very nice. - Thanks. I had no money and I was sitting here doing nothing. So I suggested to my friends that I should do some paintings. In return, they won't let me pay for tea whilst I wait to go to Europe. So it's free, please drink up. Hello. - How are you, Ayça? I'm fine and you? Do you know, last night someone left the apartment gate open again? Dear, we are afraid. What if thieves come? We are old. We will not be able to protect ourselves. They could kill us. I read in the newspaper last week... I kept forgetting to tell you. Mrs. Ariknas, I swear to God that I always close the gate. US Military Chief of Staff Richard Myers called a press conference in Washington... ...to say that some US soldiers are already in Northern Iraq. Myers said he couldn't reveal the whereabouts of the soldiers... ...but confirmed they are already in Northern Iraq... Hello, I want to reach this number. Telephone links are cut. You can't get through. I don't understand Kurdish. Could you say it in English? Today Saddam Hussein's chief military commanders... ...pledged their loyalty to him and country. Is that a storm, George? Yes Jill, and that's an understatement. It's so enormous that... Grade nine. All these tornadoes, twisters, cyclones... Yes, all these whirlwinds came from the East, dear spectators... ...only winds from the East. We have a disaster here: The penguins from the pole and the mice from the desert... ...who lived together for several years, are covered with petrol. I repeat, we have a disaster here. Yes, and I'm asking my cameraman to zoom in on what is happening behind me. Is this part of the play? - No, I think the electricity has gone. Maybe they cut the electricity. Silence please! And to be sure of that, they even burned the tiny bit that was left behind... Where we were, dear spectators... ...people were literally buried. SOLIDARITY WITH IRAQIS, PALESTINIANS, LEBANESE! LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS! War has started. The first stage of the US military operation against Iraq started... ...75 minutes after the final warning US President George Bush gave to Iraq. Operations started at 4:31 am Turkish time. In a speech George Bush gave at 5:15am... ...he warned that the war would be longer and more difficult than expected. The ultimatum that President Bush gave to Saddam Hussein expired at 3:15 am. What's the matter you bastard? Is there something wrong? The first bomb was dropped on Southern Iraq... ...77 minutes after the expiry of the ultimatum. Damn you stupid telephone! At the same time sirens warned of air attack in the capital Baghdad. Hello. Hello... - Hi Soran. How are you? I'm fine, please sit down. I think I've found someone who can help you. Really? Who is it? He is one of the people who brought me here. He has a shop in Laleli. He will meet with you. He doesn't understand exactly what you want... ...but said that he will see if he can help. Urmiye... ...Iran Miss Ayça, Urmiye is very close to Suleymaniye. Urmiye very near. Very close. Telephone. When you decide, call me. When you decide to go to Iran... ...call me. I have a boyfriend there. My beloved man is there. My wife and two daughters are in Iraq. The road is dangerous. First I will go to Europe. When I have my refugee papers, they will join me there. It's safer this way. Will you go illegally? - Yes I will, like I came here illegally. When are you going? - Soon, I hope. Is there anything I can do for you? - Actually I was going... ...to ask you a favour. I did some paintings whilst I was waiting here. I can't take them with me. Can I leave them with you? Of course you can. When I get there you can send them to me. Don't worry. They will be safe in my house. Soran, can I use your toilet? Okay. Okay, actually, I'll go later. Hello. Go in. Hello, welcome. - Hello, welcome. Your friends are all visiting? No, they all live here. And two other friends who stay here are at work. All the rooms are like this. There are 50 rooms... ...with more than 400 people living in them. More than 400? Yes, and there are rooms that are smaller and more crowded than this one. This area is full of this type of hostel. They're all overcrowded. Where are the paintings I need to take? - Behind you. Why didn't you wrap all of them? - The others are presents for my friends. Would you like tea? My friends will make tea. Hello, is everything alright? Where is Miss Vartanus? My dear, we lost her two days ago. I never thought I'd eat her halvah. She was five years younger than me. Is there anything I can do for you? My dear, don't forget to close the door when you leave the building, will you? Okay, don't worry about that. I am alone now. I am more scared than before. Come, Soran. Let's drink something. No, I should go. Come in. Why do you have to go? I really should go. Goodbye. Okay. Goodbye. - Thanks. Mahir, I decided to go to Northern Iraq, to Suleymaniye, to see Hama Ali. Anyway, you're away filming. I will be back in 10 days. Ayça, are you mad? How can you go now? There is a war there. Look Mahir... how can I explain this? I don't know. It is already difficult enough for me. I've never been with anyone like him before. I've never loved anyone as much as I love him... ...and nobody cares for me as much as he does. This happens once in a lifetime. If you don't fight for it... If you don't go after it, it slips away from you. Ayça, I do understand you very well. I've known you for 7 or 8 years. I've never seen you like this before. I know this man is very precious to you. It might feel different to everything else ...but can't you see that it can't work? Go see him, but you should know you will be very sad at the end. Look, however much it will cost me I want to be with this man. I want to spend my whole life with him. I want to share my existence with him. Okay Ayça, you want the impossible. No, he wants to come here but he can't cross the border. They won't let him, that's why he can't come here. Okay, Ayça. You're crying again... ...but now let's concentrate on your acting. We'll talk later. What is it? I'm trying to talk on the phone. Do you have a problem with that? That's enough! No one knows what you are doing. All these people in and out of your place... What are you trying to say? Are you calling me a whore? - You are immoral. Miss Ayça, please calm down. This man won't let me breathe. He is banging on my wall every night. He doesn't ring my bell like a normal human being. Can't you see he is a very old person? Calm down. You are a sick and senile old bastard! - Don't shout, Ayça. Go back inside. Who the hell are you to tell me how to live? In this building no one has the right to tell me how to live my life. You can't talk to old people like this. - To hell with you! God damn you! To hell with both of you! You are immoral people! Don't take him seriously, my dear. Don't worry. Madam, I am so sorry. I was just sad. He is old and nervous. Don't take him seriously. Madam, I am so sorry to put you in this position. I was sad and crying. Nothing else. He is old and nervous. Don't take him seriously. 52 illegal immigrants arrested We are arriving in Diyabakir soon. Miss, take a taxi or a minibus, both are safe. Saban, where is she going? She is going to the border at Habur. Look after her, she is a good person. Don't worry, my friend. Is he going to the border at Habur? - Yes, he is a good guy. How much? - It is cheap. Don't worry. Wait. Brother. Brother. Come on. Come on, light. Turn! Turn! Look, it doesn't turn. Come on. Turn green! Yellow, red, green. Okay. You see that? If it doesn't want to turn, it doesn't turn. Brother, please drive slowly. Can I put a tape on? - Okay. Do you like Ibrahim Tatlises? He is okay. When did you last cross the border? - Last night. The entrance was closed from this side. How did you cross then? I came from the other side. It was open but this side was closed. There are many trucks waiting. There is a war there, sister. Did you think it would be easy? You want to come and go as you please? You just want to wander around freely? Do you have an Iraqi passport? No, I have a Turkish passport. You'll get me into trouble. Pardon me? - Nothing. How long have you been doing this job? 7 or 8 years, I started before the war. Actually there was a war then too. Where are you coming from? - Istanbul. Is there a war there? Not exactly, but living is a kind of war there. What kind of war? Brother, life is hard in Istanbul. Expensive, no jobs, everyone digging each other's grave. But no one asks for your passport or ID there, eh? Don't laugh, sister. I asked you a question. No, they don't ask. - But what happens when you come here? Everyone asks you questions: Why are you here? What are you doing here? Am I right, sister? Yes. Where are you from? I am from Diyarbakir. But that doesn't stop them asking for our ID. Also for our passports, even when we are in Diyabakir! We always carry our ID with us. Of course you should carry your ID. - But the problem doesn't end there. If you show your ID it's a crime. If you don't, it's also a crime. Since we're already too late for the border, can I make a quick stop? Alright, but you won't be too long? - No, no. Just 5 minutes. Just 5 minutes. Thank you sister. Let's go. There is a line of tankers in front of the Habur border. Tankers crossings from Turkey to Northern Iraq are being stopped. 300 tankers are waiting for permission... ...to cross to get petrol in Northern Iraq. But most of them will have to turn back. Did they send all the tankers back? - Yes. Can you cross from Northern Iraq to here? Yes, you can cross from Northern Iraq to here. You can exit but you can't enter. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has stopped all imports... ...from Northern Iraq to Turkey. The Turkish military has created a security cordon at the border... ...and Turkish troops are firing warning shots into the mountains of Northern Iraq. Hello. Is the border open? - You should ask the policeman. Hello. - What do you want? Is the border open? - No, it is closed. When will it open? - How can I know that? Hello. - Hello. Why are you here? - How are you? I'm fine. - How are you? What are you doing here? Mother, I don't understand much Kurdish. Mother, what were you asking her? She doesn't speak Kurdish. Ask her why she is here. The mother is asking you why are you here? I am on my way to Suleymaniye to see my friend. Why are you going to Suleymaniye? - I want to see my friend there. She says: 'Your friend is there and so is my heart'. 'I haven't had any news of my son for the last two weeks'. 'I am waiting to get some information'. So she has not been able to get any information? He called me once and then he's never called again. I am waiting with hope in my heart for the border to open... ...so that I can be reunited with him... ...or I can ask drivers to get some news from him. 'Don't worry Allah is great. With His Will you will reunite with your loved ones'. With the permission of Allah and the help of the prophets... ...if all people could live together... ...and be honest to one another and trust each other, all wars would end. Our youths could come home, and all would be fine. Can I ask you a question? - Yes, you can ask. How can I go to Iran from here? You have to go to Van and take a bus from there to Iran. Ma'am, do you like music? - Yes, I do. What shall I play? I don't know. Whatever you have. - I have Ibrahim Tatlises. Shall I? Okay. - Okay, I'll play it. Sister, where were you? I was looking for you in the wedding for the last hour. I said to myself, "She's a foreigner. Where is she?" Sorry Brother. When I see a wedding I have to join the dancing. I even got them to announce on the loudspeaker: "Where is this lady?" Really? I didn't hear anything. Of course, you can't hear anything when you're dancing. Look, night is coming. Okay, we can drive late then. If we drive late the road will be closed. - How come? What's done is done. Let's see. I hope we run into a kind Commander. He might let us through. Otherwise we'll be sentinels here until the morning! I'll just start crying. The Commander will pity me and let us through. They don't care about your tears over here. I am irresistible. Insallah. Let's see. Driver, get all the IDs and bring them to me. I want to go to Urmiye tomorrow. There are two buses. One at 8.30am and one at 9.30am. There are two buses? - Yes. I'll take the 9.30. How much is it? - 20 Turkish lira. How long does it take? - Six hours. They'll check your passport at the border and then you'll continue. They don't detain people too long? - No, not usually. Is this the right bus for Iran? - Yes, it is. Wasn't it supposed to leave at 9.30? - It's not the Istanbul metro, you know. Dear passengers, we are at the border. Please take your passport and valuables with you. Leave your luggage on the bus. We will meet you on the other side of the border. Officer Ahmedi, please take Miss Ayça's passport... ...to the Commander. Mr. Huseyin, could you come to my room? Why did you go to Germany? As I told you I was working with a theatre group. We were touring. Have you been to the USA? - No, I have a visa but I never went. If you like you can see for yourself, there is no entry stamp. Cover your head! Did he take my passport because there is a problem? Don't worry. He will report to Tehran. You'll have to wait for an answer. - So how long should I wait? Maybe a few hours or you could be our guest here tonight. But my bus is waiting. How can I go on by myself? You'll have to. This is a border. Wait here or outside. Hello, Mr. Azad. Miss Ayça. - Do you remember me? Why are you waiting here? They took my passport and my bus left me here. Who took it? - The old man you were talking to. Mr. Mahmut? - Yes, he took it. Okay, calm down. Wait here. Welcome to Iran. - Thank you. How are you? - It was a little You are a friend of Azad's, aren't you? Yes, we met at the border and he helped me. Welcome again. - Thank you. I am putting some music on for you. Ibrahim Tatlises' new album. No, no. Anything else except him. Okay. I will put on... ...an old Iranian musician. Please not too loud! How come you speak such good Turkish? We watch Turkish television here. Also because this is an Azeri city. But we learned good Turkish... ...from the Turkish TV. Isn't it forbidden to watch Turkish TV? Yes, of course it is but we hide our satellite dishes in our houses... ...so that the police can't see. If someone informs the police we have to pay a fine. Are Iranian television channels not so interesting? They are okay but very boring. Also, there are only five channels. But Turkish TV has 70, 80 even 100 channels. When you start from channel one you need two hours to get to the end. When you watch our channels you sleep early and wake up early. But when we watch your channels we are always late for work! You should be careful about your hair and clothes. It is not like in Turkey. - What do you mean? You should wear a coat, otherwise you'll be disturbed... ...by all the looks you'll get. - But I am all covered up. We wear skirts in the house, not outside. Outside we wear trousers and coats. Not skirts. Ma'am, your SIM card is Iranian? No, why? Turkish phones don't work here. - Why not? Turkish phones work in Turkey, not in Iran. But I registered for an international line. If that's true it should be working now. Maybe it will work when we enter the city. No TURKCELL -Turkiye. Working? - No, not working. He says the same thing. Turkish ones are not working. Ma'am, why do you insist still? I've already told you several times. You can use an Iranian SIM card. - How much is it? 550 US Dollars. Too expensive. I can't buy it. - Expensive? 100-96... ...756... ...324... ...44-44. Can you give your passport? How is it? - Very good. It's a little tight, is that a problem? - No, not at all. Goodnight. Alright, time to close up. Hello. - Hello. How did you dare come alone... ...so late at night? Can I try calling this number again? Where are you calling? It's an international call. - We were just leaving. Can I try it once? Alright. Why did you come so late at night, as a Ione woman? I'm fine, I'm fine. Didn't the call go through? - Thank you. No. Be careful on your way home. My friend, I am a tourist. Tourist, don't you get it? Fuck off! Otherwise I'll kick your ass! Is everything okay? Nothing. Fine. Did someone call me? - No. Good night. - You too.
