We shall execute this sublime duty of ours without fail. In the name of God, of Law, and Justice. Amen. Don't worry, it's just for a few more days. [Indistinct conversation] Just while the gang is still out there. [Indistinct conversation] What are the police and FBI doing? They're looking for leads on the assassination of the President. I wonder what the gang will do next. It's kind of exciting. They've committed the most despi... They've committed the most despicable crimes. - What do you want? - The usual. The usual? It's your first time here. That's true, it's my first time in this weird place. Get out. Are you the Master? You don't seem to know me. - No. - Do you want to? You're in the gang? - [Sword clicks] - [Device beeps] No, the next poster along. Ah, you're Billy the Kid. [Machine gun fire] [Gunshots] [Gunfire ceases] What brings you here? This ad for part-time bodyguards. “WIPE OUT THE GANG AND EARN A REWARD” I have everyone I need. You're five hours too late. If you were serious … You'd have been at a station kiosk at 5 a.m to buy the job-listing magazine. You'd have called right away, then you wouldn't have missed out. Give me a break, I lost my horse. I've come on foot from Arizona. How about thinking again? This “get here first” thing is not working. The gang managed to kill the President. You need a skilled bodyguard. Hey, stupid … You haven't got a clue, have you? Huh? We could kill you and claim the reward! Close this place down … And go somewhere nice, far from the gang. - Am I right, Master? - What you say sounds reasonable. Ethical, even! It might even be what God wishes. Moses, the Ten Commandments, the law, the film censors! But hold your horses. I can't leave this place. Why not? My daughter. She doesn't want to move. [Machine gun fire] Billy, show us your skills. [Gunshot] How's that? Just 0.4 seconds. One frame faster than Alan Ladd. [Slow applause] So you'll hire me? Just wait … [Band swooshes] [Swords chime] [He breathes deeply] Is that it? Check out the cup. Nothing's happened. He is Miyamoto Musashi. [Dramatic music strikes up] THE STORY OF MIYAMOTO MUSASHI The conflicts in the final years of the age of civil wars in Japan … Produced many great swordsmen. The greatest of them all was Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi fought more than 60 duels in his lifetime. And won them all. He was a great sword-master. He believed that pursuing sword skills elevated the self. Musashi trained hard from his youth. He invented two-sword attacks. He travel led across the country to challenge other schools. He fought the Yoshiokas in Ichijo-ji, for example. And duelled with Shishido Baiken, the master of sickle and chain. The climax of his career was the famous duel … With the great Sasaki Kojiro … On Ganryu Island. Of course, Musashi was the victor. Musashi defeated Kojiro with a single sword-stroke. He is indeed the greatest of all. But, Master, there are four killers in the gang. You need more defenders. You can't have too many... Everyone here is a bodyguard. Except you. - All of them? - All of them...except you. Even that relaxed-looking guy? Fancy a game? [He scoffs] Can't be bothered. Did you do that? Shall I snuff it out? [Cigarette sizzles] Are you... a fan of sci-fi? His name is 104. [Upbeat music] LIFE STORY OF 104 [Telephone rings] In 1878, a cultural transformation … Brought the telephone to Japan. As telephone-use spread rapidly During the Ta is ho and Show a eras … Phone directories got thicker and thicker. That's why Directory Enquiries came in. Directory Enquiries proved very convenient. Many people used the service. It was always busy. After the war, automatic switchboards and privatisation came along. Directory Enquiries became “Dial 104” and was still very popular. So 104 has long been an idol. He's a star, the most entertaining of all the phone numbers. The phone company got the new name NTT. And his popularity was undiminished. His abilities are super-human. 104 doesn't know the word “impossible”. He can do anything. It all has something to do with science fiction? Sci-fi is my hobby. He has a friend called 177 … … who can even control the weather. Okay, okay. - They all have superpowers. - That's right. So we don't need your help. I can see that, old man. Bye, then. - Pop in when you're passing. - Never! Oh, we're having live music three days from now. With the band Zelda. Want a ticket? No way. [Playful piano music] [Music concludes] Er... Master … Who was that little girl? Daughter … My daughter. How come? She doesn't look at all like you. Leave it out! I don't want you standing there, we'll be opening soon. - Master … - What now? Let me work here! You don't need to pay me. What? I can work for you in exchange for food and lodging. You've changed your tune. I just had second thoughts. Well, if it's for free, I can take you. I'll get the reward for any gang-member I take down. Fair enough. But mark my words, kid. If you lay a finger on my girl, you won't last the night. You have a CV? [Lively guitar music] Our hero is a bright star in the history of the American West. The famous outlaw, Billy the Kid. In his 21 years, Billy killed 21 men. But he was a good kid, really. In the Lincoln County War … He bravely avenged his murdered boss. Aside from his determined eyes, he looked sweet. But his hell-raising earned him the nickname Billy the Kid. He has lived on the road ever since, chased by Sheriff Pat Garrett. Billy was eventually arrested. But he killed a guard and managed to escape. Furious, Pat Garrett continued the chase. And Billy just kept running. Billy was actually a sad soul. Nobody knew he was hung-up on young girls. I only just found out myself. [Branding iron sizzles] I'll introduce the others. [Rousing music] [Narrator] Sergeant Sanders is a brave US soldier. He fights on the European front in WWII. Alongside his colleagues … Lieutenant Hanley, Caje, Kirby and Little John. Sgt Sanders always takes the lead in defeating German soldiers. Their enemies never prevail … No matter how many seasons the show runs. We can see Sgt Sanders' bravery … Not only in combat but also in his style. His camouflage helmet and M1 Carbine are both anachronisms. So... he isn't... even afraid... of history! LEGEND OF MARX-ENGELS [Marimba music plays] To be frank, Karl Marx and Fried rich Engels … Are the Communist spectres who haunt Europe. Those banners boil down to "Workers of the World, Unite!" These writings are called "The German Ideology". "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts". "The Communist Manifesto", ”The Poverty of Philosophy". "The Peasant War in Germany", "Critique of Political Economy". "Das Kapital", "Critique of the Got ha Program", and so on. They apply dialectical materialism to their analysis of history … And claim that all histories of all societies to date … Are in fact histories of class-struggle. They predict that capitalism will evolve into socialism … And ultimately into Communism. Since Marx and Engels are communists … They've merged into one person! Pretty smart, no? Yes, that does it. [Melancholic music] NAKAJIMA MIYUKI SONG BOOK Can you hear me? I have searched for you for many years. She cries silently … Then laughs incredibly loudly. Everyone has gone. But now she wants to hear her own voice. She needs to feel that she is alive. So as to keep going with her life. So she turns her voice into songs and offers them to you. ”Tonight, let me say thank you” “Tell me that you love me”. The words she failed to say. The words she shouldn't have said. ”To my dear friend”. Singer, songwriter. Welcome home. Countless people whisper in your ears”. ”May I stay alive?” ”Month of parturition”, “Cold water fish”. ”Someone's breath, someone's presence”. ”A presentiment”, “How do you do”. ”From word to word, from song to song”. ”Dressing up”. Miss M. Japan's greatest poets are … [Writer: TAKAHASHI GEN'ICHIRO] Tanikawa Shuntaro, Tamura Ryuichi and Nakajima Miyuki. My friends … The gang can appear without warning. They could be anywhere. But reliable sources suggest … We should expect an attack. Examining the official records shows … A three-month interval between their attacks on shops and banks. So their next attack will be very soon. They could come at us out of the blue. Or they might pose as customers. We must be watchful. My friends... Don't ever risk lowering your guard. Are you ready to order? [Light instrumental music] How could you go to a place like that? Oh … Why shouldn't I? [Water runs] No, this piece goes there. [Music continues] For table 7. How can I help you? What will you have? There... Good! [IMPERIAL JAPANESE NAVY] [Thud] [Man claps, whoops] Let me join in. No, get lost. Hm? This is not making ice, it's broken. Fix it! Okay? Any move? No, just the same, nothing's changed. I'd like to discuss the depths of sexuality with you. In private, of course. Sure, it's 20,000 yen for 70 minutes. We may need to venture beyond discussion. Hence the depths, you see. In that case, it'd be 30,000 yen. - Listen, Master … - What? Isn't he suspicious? Could be a gang-member. He is a professor at a national university. One of the best universities. I see. What about that guy? Looking serious could be a cover. For being a gang-member. He's the pastor of the Catholic church at No 17, 6th Street. Stop worrying about such things and serve the customers, kid. What's your name? I am Popeye. That's an unusual name. Well, I was a magazine until two days ago. What do you mean? To be precise … I was a copy of "Popeye" from Magazine House … Published on 25th December 1979. Somehow I became a human. You must have been surprised. I was. Well, don't worry about it. It happens a lot. I know from my own experience. Try to have good times with your girlfriend. Forget about your past as a magazine … Now that you're human. - I totally agree. - I agree with you too. [Metal scrapes] Let me tell you, Pastor … Popeye is so funny. He knows a lot about group sounds … But he can't hold chopsticks properly. Why do you work as a bodyguard, Miyuki? - I think I like the tension. - The tension? The tension before the fight. I was once a gang-member myself. But I'm not one of them. Not any more. So my name is "Goodbye, Gangs". So I should call you... “Miss Goodbye, Gangs" from now on? Call me Miyuki. [Door closes] I'll serve her. I'll have spaghetti...vongole. Right away. [She taps table] Oh, this? My hand keeps shaking. I'm a keypunch operator. Don't worry about it, just a work habit. [Shutter opens] [He chuckles] [She whispers] Ta-bas-co. Oh, sure. Tabasco … She gets through a whole bottle. Keep an eye on her. I live on my own. Everyday is the same for me. I have dinner here every evening. Every night I get home exhausted and fall asleep. But lately I've been too tired to sleep. So I take some... sleeping pills. But... I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night. Maybe once every three months. The sound of grinding teeth wakes me up. The sound of my own teeth. I wake up to find myself... alone. [Wind blows] [Mop swoops] [Cash register dings] You'll pay me, right? - Promise you will pay me. - Of course. That's capitalism, right? Is "Das Kapital" interesting? De-Detective … I'm a policeman, not a detective. Hey, Miss, get me a cup of cocoa. One cocoa. You can tell that from my uniform. With plenty of sugar. You're all policemen, you detectives. That is not true. One of my friends is... … 87% policeman. My friends are 100% detectives. The ratio doesn't matter, Marx … Isn't my cocoa ready yet? Engels. You may have a point. However, I have a strong demand. Did you just use the word "demand"? Indeed, I used the word "demand". Spoken like a true future political offender. So, why do you demand? Well, because I have the right to demand. A right! Whatever the circumstances … Never forget to use correct socialist terminology. “Demand”, “right” and “struggle”. I will surely continue my struggle until my demands are fulfilled. How long does it take? You fascist! I will help you in any way I can. Then, listen to me … Stop shouting in this hostelry. This is not sweet! Not at all! [Scrubbing] I... I was told when I was little not to speak while eating. If I did, I'd swallow air … And end up feeling bloated. But today … you were by my side. I couldn't help doing so. [Rousing music plays on TV] [All the news shown on the screen...] Are you writing lyrics, Miyuki? It's another of my jobs. I'm not good at poems. Neither am I. There are only two responses when you read a poem … "Oh, that's nice," or "Oh, that's terrible". Okay … How about "It doesn't make sense"? I try not to think like that. [He mutters, clicks tongue] It's gone. - Do you enjoy writing? - I think so. But I still don't know how I write a poem. Without knowing how we write poems … Or even what we write at all … Poets live ephemeral moments … Before we're lost in the darkness of eternity. [...to all of you, I say...] [Machine gun fire] [Bullets ricochet] Master … We should get a new one. [Music - "Auld Lang Syne"] Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming... Thank you for coming... Good work, everyone! Get a good rest tonight … For a better tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. [Door closes] It's bedtime. What? You all sleep in here? [Gentle snoring] [He snores] [Water drips] [Bright, upbeat music] [Bustling conversation] One Americano, three chocolate parfaits. And one Neapolitan. - What's this? - Sorry? This is not what I ordered. I had a weird dream last night. [Harry Callahan] 100,000 standing on-lookers sang 'My Old Kentucky Home'. I was on the home stretch, trailing the field of 14 horses. Kentucky Shelly was in the lead by several heads. My great rival, Forward Pathway, was running third. I was going at 6 seconds per 100 metres. It was the 4th of May, 1968 … On Churchill Downs Racetrack, Louisville. I was catching up with Forward Pathway. I was confident I could win. As we took the final corner, the front runners slowed down. I made a final push. I overtook most of the front runners. I went past Kentucky Shelly and finally overtook Forward Pathway. I'm going to win the Kentucky Derby. Only 200 metres left! Then I saw something incredible. Three unknown horses appeared ahead of me. They blocked my way forward. Now we were on the home straight at Nakayama Racecourse. It was the 18th of May and I was caught in a trap. Ahead of those three horses … I saw Forward Pathway, which I'd already overtaken! See? The three horses ran unsteadily, keep me from overtaking. The gang-member riding me shouted "Let's do this!" I responded "But...", and he yelled … "I can't stand this!" He began firing his machine-gun. Ratatat! Ratatat! [Machine gun fire] [Callaghan laughs] The three horses were full of holes like Swiss cheese and I jumped over them. I soon overtook Forward Pathway … Who took refuge in the stadium. I kept going straight on … But I couldn't see any finish line. I've lived all my life with Gila Monster. My father used to say … "Gila Monster showed up at our place …” "On the very day you were born". So, I have one thing to ask you guys. Yes, sir! I want you... not to be like those three horses which blocked my way. Fix that! - Isn't this...? - Yes - I thought so. - Shouldn't we tell them? I usually eat it without complaining. They might think of us as know-it-alls. But we shouldn't accept it. She's right, if we don't tell them … They won't change, they'll think we're okay with it. That's right. Let's not be ashamed of our intelligence. Excuse me, waiter! - Yes? - Can you exchange these dishes? We ordered spaghetti vongole. These are what used to be spaghetti vongole. We don't like it. Young ladies... My father died fighting in the Philippines. My first husband was a trumpeter. He used to let Gila Monster sit on his lap … As he played a ballad. He died during the war. Poor thing, a bullet went through his cheeks. [Wind blows] You know... I've been thinking. Maybe you shouldn't order noodles … to avoid swallowing air. You're sweet. Well, I mean, so... Why don't you have pilaf or something? You're right. I really liked Paul. His bass was so low-slung! Stormy! Are you an idiot? Paul is hopeless, Sid is the best. I know I'm an idiot. Really? I'm an idiot too. Well, there's a coincidence! So am I! Oh, you too? [Murmured conversation] It's strange that you say I'm sweet. Maybe. - I am a bit strange. - That's not what I meant. I'm not good at words. They're strange. Words... I married again. I took Gila Monster with me, of course. My second husband never told me … What his profession was. He always said it was complex … That it required sensitivity and contributed to the public good. He was a lovely person. He was so nice to Gila Monster too. But... This husband also had … An unfortunate accident at work. His entire face got burnt. Somehow his head caught fire. As his face went up in flames … He let out a great cry … and ran away for 100 metres. The workmate who brought him home … Said it was as if the Olympic torch had raced the 100-metre sprint right after the opening ceremony. It was only three hours or so … From the time he was brought home to his last breath. He put his hands around his bandaged face, and kept saying … "I miss my face". Over and over again. His face was featureless, its contour had gone. Even he could not tell exactly … Where the eyes, the nose, and the mouth had been. So I cut a piece of card … Into the shape of a face. I made holes for the eyes and the mouth. And I attached the pieces as a nose, using adhesive. Then... I placed this mask made of card onto his face. "My dear, here is your face". "This is your face". I brought his hand to the mask. "Sure, I can feel my face”. "This is surely my face”. "I'm handsome, right?" After he touched the mask with his own hands … He finally calmed down. He said "Hey". Now that he had a face again … He seemed to be wondering what else he wanted to ask … Before he died. "What did our Gila Monster look like?" I could not answer him. I just couldn't describe in words what Gila Monster looked like. "I can't describe it". "Ah, that's a shame". So said my husband, and then he died. And you re-married again … With me. I still have my health. And we're happy because we're both in our old age. Don't you think? But we all die at some point. I am ready for my own death. But there's one thing I really want to achieve before the time comes. You want to describe what Gila Monster looked like. I can't... describe how I feel. I can't either. It's difficult to say how I feel. I don't like difficult words. Difficult words make me sad. A free person like you... never knows what an office lady feels. Like humans don't know what dolphins feel. That's why... I tend to swallow my words. That's why... you tend to swallow your feelings. Swallowed feelings become air. Swallowed air makes you bloated. And I explode every three months. Old lady, didn't it look like John Lennon? More likely, Takahashi Gen'ichiro. Nah. It must have a hint of London Folk. What's London Folk? Some kind of European rock? [Dishes rattle] - Billy. - Yep? I haven't told you about my daughter. I tell all my friends about her. Look, these were a bargain! My wife gave birth. She came out with the baby in her arms. "Look at this cute one!” "She'll become more beautiful than me," she said. The baby chuckled, looking at me. I took the baby and held her. She was light and warm. She smelt nice and wriggled in my arms. "Hello," I said. "I'm your daddy". The baby said "Da-da". See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - That's no good! You say "Thank you very much". - Come, come. - There she is. Come here. - Sorry … - You kept us waiting. I told you on phone. - Oh, did you? - Yes. I couldn't be bothered. She didn't get it at all. [They talk at once] Tatum has been my treasure. - Tatum? - Yes, her name is Tatum. I realised there were two things to teach her … For her to grow up to be a lovely girl by the age of five. You know what? How to hold chopsticks... and how to greet people? No. Dance and mathematics. - Tomorrow is now totally... - I know. I can't help feeling responsible. - No, don't feel that way. - You don't think so? But I don't want them saying those things. So I rang them back and an auntie took the call. She was so upset! It was a surprise. [Chatter continues] "Tatum, dance for me," I said. Tatum, with her hair grown to her shoulders, danced by the bed. "Daddy, am I good?" That's what she asked as she jumped on the bed. "Of course you are". Tatum could swing to any tune. Soaked in sweat … Tatum lay flat on the bed. "Daddy, let me dance to another tune!" I think it took two years to lose weight. Very slim now. "Tatum, what is one plus one?" I asked. Tatum bit the end of a pencil lightly. "Don't bite the pencil!" Tatum stuck her tongue out. "Um... one plus one is three". "One is Daddy, one is Mummy”. "So we have Daddy, Mummy and Tatum”. "Three of us”. "So, one plus one is three". [Plane engine rumbles, classical music plays on TV] All I want from her is a more serious engagement with sex. Mm. As she tells it … She is not frigid, not lesbian, nor into sadomasochism. She just feels it... - And climaxes. - … somewhere. She thinks she loves me. So why can't she have sex properly with me? Mm. No way, then I'd be dead! Listen to you and I'd get killed. Stop it, just tell us what it was like. They said "Hands up". It was the 26th of September, 1968. A sunny Thursday afternoon, around 3pm. The gang was pretty famous by then. So I spotted right away that it was them. The way they dressed made it obvious. - True. - Black soft hats. Black three-piece suits, white gloves. They all had the same machine guns. You know, like Al Capone, John Dillinger … And that Barlowe, something Barlowe. That was the way they stood. "We don't want to be rough with you," they said. So, we just had our hands in the air. Watching them do their job so smartly and swiftly … I think we were kind-of glad to be attacked by this famous gang. Even after they left … We still had our hands in the air. Still savouring the brilliant way they attacked us. - I see. - You see? America no. One America no. Hey, Billy … See if he is a gangster. - Sure. - Not so fast! You're not going to ask him directly, are you? - Why shouldn't I? - You want to die? Be subtle, okay? - You get it? - Yes. Hey, boss, fancy a hot chick? Easy, lad. I'm waiting for my girlfriend. She's 22, 172 cm tall. Her bust, waist and hips are 85, 59 and 87 cm. She just returned from the Sorbonne. She's prettier than Christine Kaufmann at her prime. She has perfectly shaped and malleable breasts. Her waist is better than Farrah Fawcett's. She wears Arpège by Lanvin. She has the flexibility of a trained jazz dancer. So she can manage all sexual positions, and she's a fine cook. She can play Schumann's 'Arabesque' faultlessly. She always tells me I am her only love. Now, lad … If yours is better than my girlfriend, bring the girl. But if she's not … I'll make sure you and she are dead in pieces. [Gunfire] [Sword swishes] My back!

It's not true. Any girl can be happy just by changing the way she views the world. You're saying I'm wrong? She's right, just look in a mirror. I bet you'll fall in love with yourself. I want to go somewhere far away. There are so many places I've never been. I'd like to travel to the north. It will be cold and snowing quietly. Everything covered in white. It will be vast and beautiful. But a places like this make you feel warm inside. The same warmth as in the colour orange. Can I ask you something? I'm relying on your superpower. What is it? Can you make some snow fall around Tatum? I'm afraid I can't do that. My friend 177 would be able to do that. But he's busy right now. I'm sorry. - Dad … - Mm? What is it, Tatum? - I have a question. - Go ahead. Where is "somewhere over the rainbow"? Well, I guess it's somewhere, somewhere over the rainbow. Then where is "somewhere, somewhere over the rainbow"? It's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere over the rainbow. I knew you'd say so. So where is "somewhere, somewhere, somewhere over the rainbow"? Answer within five words. "Some-where over the rainbow" is within five words, right? Mm... Somewhere over that. Dad … Yes? I agree it's a clever answer, in a way. But you realise I'll get scolded if I write that in my summer project? You actually don't know where "somewhere over the rainbow" is. Oh, well, I wonder who can tell me. [Wind blows] [Radio] This is the 12 o'clock weather report. [Man speaks English on radio] Huh? What's going on? [Door closes] You have no customers. Why? Is your business okay? I want my cocoa sweet this time. You hear me, miss? Hmm. Oh. Hey, Marx … I have some time today, so, for your ears only … I can pass on some top-secret information. Are you serious, detective? It's a news that came in this morning. Apparently, the gang … Just crossed the Rio Grande. Did they? What an amazing network the authorities have! I know! Kind of! You got it right. How long does it take?! My cocoa! The live concert is tomorrow. Can you re-paint the wall for Zelda? I'll leave it to you, do a good job. Work hard! Oh, bad, bad. This is bad. Does it taste that bad? It is bad. The Master was in high spirits yesterday. Going on about a 'stake-out'. - I mean, here. - What? See? It's bad. There are no customers. But I know what the boss is like. He will set up a stake-out regardless. Oh, I see. So, you're Jesus Christ too. Don't call me by an abstract name like 'Jesus Christ'. Just now, three teenage girls talking about a rock singer … Turned to me and said … "Oh, that was Jesus". No way! Understand? Anyone can tell I am Jesus Christ. But a good pastor would know what kind of Jesus Christ I am. I don't understand. What kind of Jesus Christ are you? [Indistinct conversation] I am Jesus Christ as written in the poetry of Kaneko Mitsuharu! Impossible... Jesus Christ written by Kaneko Mitsuharu isn't like you. I have clear views about Kaneko's poetry. What a stupid guy you are! You are talking about the 'Jesus Christ' in Kaneko's existing poetry. I'm the Jesus Christ that he will write in the future. I am the prototype. Are you saying... Kaneko will write a 'Jesus Christ' who is like you? A third-rate pastor like you will never understand. You assume the 'Jesus Christ' that Kaneko will write … Will be as hard-boiled as I am? I told you, I'm the prototype! Listen, if you still don't get it, read some Max Weber. 'The Religion of India'. That's the only piece of advice I can give you. Now, I have to go home. Where is your home? [He stamps] I'm going back to Kaneko's place! - Is Kaneko still alive? - Don't know. [Door opens] Does everyone smoke and talk about their life after sex? We could eat braised beef on rice instead. Or discuss the double helix of DNA, namely deoxyribonucleic acid. [Wind blows] [He rattles phone hook] Checkmate, it's White Rock,over. What's up? Looking forward to tomorrow, we'll have a crowd. We're doing okay, it's all ready for you. I've had the backdrop painted by a top-notch artist. It's expensive! He's the best. It's brilliant, you'll love it to death. Be ready for the best. See you tomorrow, bye-bye! No need to stay near her when she is not using tabasco, idiot. I wanted to. She is kind of sickly, you know. When I started swallowing air... now that I come to think of it … It was springtime and I was five. I was playing the park … And one of the kids next door said to me … "Your mummy...” "… is not your real mother". I looked at Mum's face at dinner. I realised that Mum was not pretty. I always wanted to ask her if it was true. Whenever I was about to ask … I saw Mum's gentle-looking, slanted eyes... and I lost the momentum. So I started swallowing air. I was a slow-eater because I had gastric ptosis. At school dinners … I was the last one to finish. That's why people started calling me … 'Billy Who Remains Till Last'. [Door opens] - Kojiro! - Musashi! It's good. I had some business nearby. I heard you were here. How have you been? Any news? Same as before. The scar on my left shoulder from that time aches sometimes. From what time? You know, Ganryu Island. See, this one, on my left shoulder. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hit you that hard. I couldn't control myself, I was young back then. No worries, that was long ago. Can you stay a bit longer? Great! Oh! I can feel teeth-grinding coming on. I always fear the teeth-grinding. Because it gives me an indescribable feeling. - Where is the toilet? - Just over there. Thanks. [Door opens, closes] “Anxiety and Destruction”. "Creation and Construction". Can't you write without muttering? - What? - Can't you write without muttering? No, I can't. I simply write down whatever words come out of my mouth. Okay, let me see. No! I don't like showing anyone my work-in-progress. Sorry. You're mean. I'll read it out to you when it's finished. Just be patient, okay? Emm... Could you see me off? Of course. - Did you see it? - See what? - Inside the case. - No, I didn't. - Are you sure? - I saw nothing. - You swear? - I swear. Is Zelda named after Zelda Fitzgerald? They're a band for kids, doing a live show tomorrow. Tomorrow? See you tomorrow. Hey... You should probably see your doctor. Leave it out! [Footsteps approach] Dad, this is my boyfriend, Ryan. Good to meet you. Those were the good times. They never said no to people who wanted to join. They were nice. You're right. Takenokozoku and roller-skaters … were so popular back then. But they've gone now. They quit, they've all disappeared. I suppose that's how time changes things. Well … [He sighs] Shall we go now? Huh? Boss, I've been chasing him since 1936. Every single day of my life. That's because … I'm certain that the reason the gangs have taken over … Is rooted in that fake Marx-Engels himself, an of fence to the public gaze. However... "However" what? He was born in 1951. The dates don't match up. It might not be important, but... It's certainly not! I was born in 1955. Shut up, stop it! How did you start writing poems? Individuals are weak. Don't you think so? Dunno. When a group confronts an individual, the individual will lose. No matter how superior the individual possibly be. Still, we must keep improving ourselves. But that strategy has its limitations. Phew! Samurai never... drink until they get drunk. And so on, right. I'm not drunk, am I? - No? - Drink, let's do it. We're all human after all. I guess so. We must have names. Names with power. Once a name gains power, we get an era belongs to that name. Then everything done under that name will be justified. - I don't get it. - I mean... I write poetry as a revenge of an individual against the group. Okay … [He mutters] Then why do you work as a bodyguard? That's also part of my revenge. You like revenge! Revenge is just a word. You can't rely on it. That may not be true. - What do you mean? - I'll give you a clue. That's... - Howard Hughes, the magnate. - No, it's his son. I see. Why do you carry his photo? He's my ex-boyfriend. [Classical music plays on TV] - Come again. - Thank you very much. - The concert is tomorrow? - Want to come? - Absolutely, see you tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Have a good night. - Have a good night. Well … What do you think he is painting? - Dad. - Hm? Stop treating me like a child. I know everything. Isn't this style called 'surrealism'? Hmm … Love is the desire to be loved back. Well, yes, something like that. He used to be in a motorcycle gang. Now he's an office worker, but... I'll see him again soon. He will come here soon. Why? [They snore] - Cheers! - Cheers! [He sighs] [Applause] [She plays country dance music] Do you get the concept of this painting, Marx? I'll explain it to you. I'm not supposed to, but we'll make an exception. It depicts John Lennon versus a Martian. This is John Lennon. And this is a Martian. And you can see a bird here. That represents Tyler. Get it? Can't you see? Why can't you get my feeling? [Music speeds up] Wake up, Musashi. Musashi, you're the only one who gets me. Please wake up! Mu-kun … [Music continues] - Master. - Yes? Have you ever been in love? Who do you think I am? Heading home? Bye then, goodnight. Goodnight. [Music concludes] Let's dance, Miyuki. Sure, but who'll play the piano? Oh, right. I'll play for you, I can play the piano. [She chuckles] [He plays "Piano Sonata No. 19 In G Minor" by Beethoven] Wow, this feels so good. - Right? - It does. This really feels good. I'm sleepy... Maybe the gang won't turn up after all. [Nakajima Miyuki] Something is flying in the air. But it's too dark to see. Between the winds … … dozens of streaks of stark light are entangled. They shine on a girl flying in the air. On her back … Are a pair of pure white wings. Much longer than her own height. She didn't know why she decided to fly on such a windy night. The winds toy with the girl, who can't control them. The girl dives down in a whirl until she's close to the water. Then soars up in the air for 100 metres. "Brother! Brother!" The turbulent air. Rips off one of her wings … By the root and blows it away. [Bright instrumental music] The girl falls, far down the river.

It's so hard bringing rain to the desert. - Sahara? - Gobi. - What lovely weather. - Ah. 710, the year the old capital Heijo-kyo was built. I mean, Zelda is fundamentally not a country music band.

[Engines rev] [Screaming] Bruce. [Screaming] Stick 'em up! [He chuckles] [Gunfire, screaming] We don't want to be rough with you. - Just as I said. - Indeed. [Customers squeal, murmur] You really are cute. [Engine idles] - It's been a long time. - It has. But I've waited, to bring you an end. I know. Right, all of you, move to the walls. Whichever wall is closest wall to you. You go that way. There. Be quick! Okay! Put both hands on the wall, okay? Hey, form a line, idiot. Hands on the wall, I told you! Why do I have to teach you everything? Use your common sense, huh? Don't you read the newspapers? Grown-ups read the papers. - Boss, what is happening? - Oh, you're here? Of course I am, we came together. Did we? Never mind. Hey, about this event … I warned you, didn't I? Yesterday morning, right? Well, but... What? Never mind. Master! I'm here! Where is the safe? [Master chuckles] What, are you sick? The gang is finally here! Stop acting theatrical. Take whatever's in the cash register. I've been waiting for this day for the past five years! Every single second of it! I've been waiting for you for the past five years. Sorry to make you wait. Your waiting is over. The author nicknamed me "Serious Gang-member". I'm a civil servant, working in the municipal office. But as a salary man, I decided one day that … I'd become the world's best salary man. To become the best salary man … I needed a world-class hobby. - That's why you joined the gang? - Right. I'm a gang-member in my free time. Salarymen like to have hobbies. [Sword clangs] [Gunshot] [Screaming] [Faint screaming, gunfire] Marx-Engels may die … But dialectical materialism … Historical materialism … Marxist economics... and the Communist Manifesto will never die! [Flag flutters in wind] My mission is now over. - Run! - Stop! [Clamouring] [Clamouring continues] [Master grunts] [Master grunts] Damn! Hey! [Blows, grunting] Master? My wife... … was killed by the gangs! Five seconds... Four, three... Hello, excuse me, how's it going? So-so. - You risk your life at work. - It's my job. - Any comment on the gang? - I don't know. Have you been in the police for long? Well, yes, since the 5.14 incident in 1977. When there were two deaths and 18 arrests? Right. - Is that you? - Huh? NTV's roving activist? Well, yes. Wow, I can't believe you're interviewing me! - My father respects you too. - I'm glad to hear it. Can you say something to your parents now? Sure. Father, Mother, it's me. My colleague was killed just now. But I am okay. I'll be home in the summer. - Wave to the camera. - Sure. And, cut! - Don't step on the cable. - No. Hey, Miyuki … 27 December 1973, a Wednesday afternoon. Do you remember that day? I do. It was a little cloudy. We took the Meiji Bypass at 152km/h … To see a baby rhinoceros in Higashiyama Zoo. Half an hour earlier … You'd read about the baby rhino … In the paper on bed in my apartment. That's right. You said we could go and see it right away. I was so excited that I rushed uncautiously... and put on mismatched socks. I know. We saw the baby rhino and its mother covered in mud. We shared pastries, one with bean-paste and the other with cream. And drank Meito milk. Didn't we? We did. You discussed the happiness of the rhinos covered in mud. You discussed the happiness of families, and the roots of all evil. And you left the gang. [She sniffs] But you … You haven't. And you went on to rob 292 people of their happiness. I never claimed the murder and plunder … Would bring creation or construction. We've never sought to justify our own actions. [Miyuki gasps] You're a bad boy. [He groans] [She pants] [Machine gun fire] [Glass smashes; Faint machine gun fire] What's that noise? [Gunfire] [Bullet ricochets] [Machine gun fire] [Table creaks] [Gunshot] Show them no mercy! [Machine gun fire] Oh! Father, Mother... Sorry, I won't make it home this summer. [He groans] Hey! My boys! Come back to me! Come back to me now! Aren't you coming? [Machine gun fire] We chose to become gang-members of our own free will. Nobody obliged nor forced us to join. It's true that what we do is sometimes unreasonably idealistic. It's not that we didn't realise that. But... that behaviour is part of our innate identity as a gang. When we've finished a job … And are back at our desks … We suffer from dizzying anxieties. The anxiety that we are gradually distancing ourselves from this world. The anxiety that what we achieved … And what we dream of achieving are in fact totally opposite. Gripped by such anxieties … We tell ourselves never to look away from what we've done … Even when our hearts desperately want to run away blindly. You can never hold a machine-gun … with your hands busy covering your eyes. That would mean abandoning your identity as a gangster. [Gunshot] [Machine gun fire] [He groans, roars] [Machine gun fire] [Thud] [Sombre music; Machine gun fire] [Music continues] [Sound fades, music builds] [Machine gun fire; Music continues] [Music stops] Tatum! [Water drips] Everything has completely changed. It will take a long time to tidy this up. - Does it hurt? - Maybe it does. But rather than feeling pain … I have sensed that there's a hole in my tummy. It's all in your mind. Maybe. I am a bit too sensitive. Look, a beautiful rainbow. It is beautiful. I feel as if I'm going to die. The worst was the worst. It's all gone. No, it's a new start. I'm leaving. - Take care. - I will. I'll stay here to rebuild this place. - Take care. - I will. Where are you going, Billy? - I'll go and find it. - Find what? Creation... and construction. - Be well. - I will. Billy! Stop by when you're around. Sure, I will.
