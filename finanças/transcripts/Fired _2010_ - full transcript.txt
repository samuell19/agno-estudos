Do we really have to fire..? 121 employees out of 137 in the London office. So that is integral to my plan. Have you thought of the negative publicity? In this day and age of economic downturns and recession, sir.. ..I think we can spin this. We can sell the story. (Lights Off) (Indistinct Conversations) (Door Opens) (Door Closes) (Door Opens) Cheryl? (Shushing) (Groaning) (Breathing Heavily) (Thunder Rumbling) (Beeping) (Banging) Should have fired you as well. You can stay. (Moans) Sorry, Chief. Just locking up. Incidentally, Chief. Congratulations! Is everybody gone? - Yes, sir. Only Anuj sir is in his cabin. In his ex-cabin. Check over there too. As you say, sir. (Knock On Door) Joy. I'm still the boss. For the next couple of minutes. Does it give you a warm fuzzy feeling to fire 121 people.. ..including your own mentor. I'm sorry. What can I do? What can you do? You've done it all. All the best for your future. Thank you, sir. (Door Opens) (Alarms Wailing) (Phone Ringing) Damn it! Hello. Hello, sir. Are you there?

Yes, Ruby too. And I fired 120 others along with her. You want all their names and designations? Shall I list them? Is this what you called for? Listen. I was phoning to remind you to take your medicines, okay. Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye. (Phone Beeps) Let's get this done and get out of here. (Keyboard Clacking) (Indistinct Conversations) The rumors that you hear.. All the rumors you've been listening to.. ..they are true. An Indian multinational OFS has taken over us.. ..and they've made me.. ..group CEO. But they have some conditions. They won't be able to keep you. You have to understand, it's not you. We, the whole Company is being downsized. I don't get this. What do you mean, they cannot keep me? You're fired. Joy, how could you do this? (Camera Clicks) I love you. No, you don't. Of course, I do. I'm going to look after you like an angel. (Door Opens) Thank you, Arnold. Crap! Crap! (Champagne Opening Sounds) (Beeping) Thomas? Milan. Are you around? Mark? Thomas?

Chief, I was doing paperwork. To hell with your paperwork! Do you know Ms. Harmison was in the office? Ms. Harmison? I did not see anyone, sir. I made a mistake firing only 121 people.

In fact I was about to leave the office.. ..so shall I email you the reports again? We need to file it before 10 AM Indian Standard Time. The legal guys have been waiting to review the same, okay. We need it ASAP. Yes. In about 30 minutes. Joy, I'm sorry but we don't have even 30 minutes. Okay? By right now I mean right now. I have kept all the secretarial staff back over here. Yes.
