♪ ♪ Taye: IT IS TIME FOR US TOGATHER VIRTUALLY, ALTHOUGH WE'D RATHER MEET IN PERSON,AND COLLECTIVELY REJOICE. NONETHELESS, THIS CELEBRATION IS A BRAND NEW ITERATION OF THE PARTY THAT IS KNOWN AS CRITICS CHOICE. YOU WILL SEE SOME FAMOUS FACES ON THIS STAGE AND OTHER PLACES TYPICALLY FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR HOME. AND OF COURSE WE'LL BE AWARDING LEAD PERFORMERS AND SUPPORTING AND THE TV SHOWS AND FILMS FOR WHICH THEY'RE KNOWN. WE HEARD THE SOUND OF METAL AND SAW NOMADS NEVER SETTLE, A PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN MADE MEN SORRY. DA FIVE BLOODS WERE DA BOMB. THEY BLEW UP IN VIETNAM. AND WE LEARNED KOREAN WATER CELERY IS CALLED MINARI. THESE MOVIES STREAMED INTO OUR HOMES AND FILLED OUR HEARTS DESIRE. AND THIS YEAR'S SERIES OFFERINGS WERE ALSO FULL BLOWN FIRE. "THE CROWN" RE-SHOT THE WEDDING OF PRINCE CHUCK AND LADY DI. "LOVECRAFT COUNTRY" MADE US WONDER IF WE ALL WERE HIGH. SAUL GOODMAN'S LIFE WAS COMPLICATED, SCARY, AND ABSURD. "THE MANDALORIAN" WAS LOVED BY EV'RY STAR WARS NERD. "THE UNDOING" SAW HUGH GRANT DOING SOMETHING PRETTY DRASTIC, AND OUR OBSESSION WITH "THE QUEENS GAMBIT" WAS SIMPLY PAWNOGRAPHIC. AND IF MY LITTLE SPOKEN WORD HAS LEFT YOU WANTING MORE, CHECK OUT ALL THESE SHOWS. SEE WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE! WE WILL SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHAT WE MEAN. YOU ARE CULTURAL DISRUPTORS. YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE. YOU WANT TO BE SOMEBODY OR NOT? I'VE GOT MY TIME COMING TO ME. IT ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE. IT'S ABOUT BEING IN THE ROOM. WHAT'S GOING ON? I LOVE THE WAY YOU SEE THE WORLD. ARE YOU RECEIVING THIS? I COULD BE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T EVER SAY A FINAL GOODBYE. JUST SAY I'LL SEE YOU DOWN THE ROAD. THIS MOVEMENT IS CALLED A STRUGGLES BECAUSE WE ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING! THESE ARE STORIES OF MEN AND WOMEN VERY MUCH LIKE YOU, WAITING FOR BETTER DAYS TO COME. Announcer: HERE'S THE HOST OF THE 26TH ANNUAL CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS. FROM THE CW'S "ALL-AMERICAN," TAYE DIGGS! Taye: HELLO, EVERYONE. I'M TAYE DIGGS, AND I'M HOSTING THE CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW. AND I'LL KEEP DOING IT UNTIL THEY ADD AN AWARDS SHOW CATEGORY. THIS YEAR'S SHOW IS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SOCIAL DISTANCING MEANS THAT MOST OF OUR PRESENTERS AND NOMINEES WILL BE WATCHING THE SHOW FROM AFAR. AND SINCE MOST OF THEM ARE IN THEIR LIVING ROOMS, I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON ON THIS SHOW NOT WEARING SWEATPANTS. I CALL IT AWARD SHOW CASUAL. FORMAL ON TOP. COMFY ON THE BOTTOM. ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE OF BEAMING INTO THE SHOW IS THAT YOU CAN BE ANYWHERE. WELL, ANYWHERE WITH WI-FI. WE HAVE STARS IN ENGLAND, GERMANY, ISRAEL, AUSTRALIA, AND ALL OVER THE USA, EVEN HAWAII. AND WE HAVE MORE LIVE NOMINEES ATTENDING THAN EVER BEFORE. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE VIRTUAL, WE STILL HAVE TABLES FULL OF CELEBRITIES AND FILMMAKERS. THERE'S CAREY MULLIGAN, STAR OF "PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN."

AND HERE'S "DA 5 BLOODS" TABLE. THE GREAT DELROY LINDO AND FILMMAKER SPIKE LEE. BY THE WAY, HERE'S A LITTLE TIP FOR THE WHITE FOLKS. DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO OVER-ENUNCIATE THE "DA" IN THE "DA FIVE BLOODS". LET IT COME OUT NATURALLY. "DA FIVE BLOODS". A LOT HAS CHANGED THIS YEAR. THIS WAS THE YEAR THAT FINDING YOURSELF IN "SCHITT'S CREEK" IS ACTUALLY A GOOD THING. THEY HAVE FIVE NOMINATIONS. THAT WAS TOPPED BY "THE CROWN," WHICH HAS 6. ONE OF THOSE NOMINATIONS WAS FOR HER PORTRAYAL OF PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER. SAY HELLO TO GILLIAN ANDERSON! HI, GILLIAN. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION. CONGRATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I JUST STARTED MY NEW SHOW "WALKER" BUT MY LAST SERIES "SUPERNATURAL" ENDED AFTER 15 YEARS AND 327 EPISODES.

I AM PRESENTING BEST YOUNG ACTOR AND ACTRESS COMING UP NEXT. Announcer: WHEN THE 26TH ANNUAL CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS CONTINUES. Taye: WELCOME BACK. LET'S CHECK IN WITH ANOTHER NOMINEE. SAY HELLO TO JURNEE SMOLLETT. JURNEE, HOW ARE YOU? I'M WONDERFUL, HOW ARE YOU? Taye: EXCELLENT. YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT. THANK YOU. Taye: CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION FOR BEST ACTRESS IN A DRAMA SERIES FOR "LOVECRAFT COUNTRY." I HAVE A QUESTION. THAT SHOW WAS PRETTY OUT THERE. HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR A PERFORMANCE LIKE THAT? IN ALWAYS. I TRY TO OPEN MY CREATIVE CHANNELS WITH AS MUCH RESEARCH AS POSSIBLE. WHAT LIFE IS LIKE TO BE A BLACK WOMAN IN JIM CROW AMERICA. THE PHOTOGRAPHY, MUSIC. THE WRITINGS. IT GAVE ME INSIGHT INTO HUMANITY. WOMAN WHO IS BATTLING WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE PATRIARCHY. Taye: ABSOLUTELY. DID YOU WATCH ANY OF MY PERFORMANCES FOR INSPIRATION? ALL OF IT. Taye: I THOUGHT I COULD SEE LITTLE BITS. PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT YOU'VE ALREADY WON A CRITICS CHOICE AWARD FOR BEST CHILD PERFORMANCE FOR "EVE'S BAYOU" BACK IN 1998. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT WHEN YOU WON THAT? MY FIRST TIME WINNING AN AWARD. I WAS VERY EXCITED. I REMEMBER BEING IN A ROOM WITH, LIKE, JAMES CAMERON. REALLY COOL PEOPLE. BEING AROUND ALL THESE COOL PEOPLE. Taye: YOU ARE WONDERFUL THEN AND YOUR WONDERFUL TODAY. THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK TONIGHT, JURNEE! AS YOU'VE SEEN, MUCH OF THIS YEAR'S SHOW IS BEING DONE VIA THE INTERNET BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. MANY OF OUR CELEBRITY PRESENTERS ARE SHOOTING THEMSELVES FROM HOME. IT SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH, BUT IT'S NOT. HOW YOU PRESENT YOURSELF FROM HOME SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. SO WE SENT OUR CELEBRITIES AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO OUR EXPERT HAS BEEN PRODUCING HIS OWN SEGMENTS FOR THE "DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH" FROM HIS HOME IN NEW YORK. HERE'S ROY WOOD, JR. THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF THIS YEAR'S CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS. THIS INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO IS FILLED WITH TIPS AND POINTERS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR CRITICS CHOICE APPEARANCE FROM YOUR OWN HOME. IT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS, BUT WHILE TELECONFERENCING, THE ITEMS IN YOUR BACKGROUND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE AUDIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, A FILLED BOOKCASE TELLS THE AUDIENCE, "I CAN AFFORD TO BUY BOOKS!" AND WHILE THIS IS BOUND TO IMPRESS, IT'S THE TITLES OF THE BOOKS THAT SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT YOU. SO YOU MAY WANT TO REPLACE YOUR COPIES OF "ART OF THE DEAL," AND "THE BEST OF LARRY FLYNT" WITH A FEW FILM CRITICISM BOOKS, ESPECIALLY ANYTHING BY GENE SHALIT. NOW WE'VE COVERED HOME DECOR, IF YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THE BACKGROUND, LET IT BE THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF HOME DECOR. CHILDREN. GET OUR OF HERE, CHILD! YOU ARE MESSING UP MY MOMENT ON TV. AVOID PLACING A TELESCOPE IN YOUR BACKGROUND. TO YOU, IT INDICATES THAT YOU ENJOY THE HOBBY OF STARGAZING. BUT, TO OTHERS, IT MAY SAY "MY NEIGHBORS DON'T HAVE CURTAINS." AND A WORD OF CAUTION, SOME OF YOU MAY THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH BEING NAKED FROM THE WAIST DOWN. BASED ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST IT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE PRODUCERS MIGHT DECIDE TO PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. AND EVERYBODY'S GOTTA STAND. THAT TIP IS FOR THE WHITE PEOPLE, I KNOW THE BLACK PEOPLE, WE AIN'T STANDING. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU HAVE EVER RECEIVED AN AWARD, I'M TALKING IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE, INCLUDE THEM ON YOUR BOOKCASE. IT COULD BE A NOBEL PRIZE OR A PEEWEE SOCCER PARTICIPATION TROPHY. IT DOESN'T MATTER. AN ACCOLADE IS AN ACCOLADE. AND, SUBLIMINALLY, YOU ARE TELLING THE AUDIENCE, "HEY, YOU! LOOK AT ME! I'M AN ACHIEVER." GOOD LUCK TO EVERYBODY AND THANKS AGAIN! ALL RIGHT. GET OUT OF THIS TUXEDO. Taye: THANK YOU, ROY WOOD JR. NOW, YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN OUR NEXT PRESENTER ON "BLACK-ISH", "MIXED-ISH" AND "GROWN-ISH". I WISH I COULD DISH OUT AN "ISH" JOKE HERE WITHOUT LOOKING FOOL-ISH BUT I CAN'T ACCOMPL-ISH THAT SO I'LL NOT ANGU-ISH AND JUST FINISH WITH A STRAIGHT-ISH INTRO: HERE'S YARA SHAHIDI. IN HOLLYWOOD, I GET TO WEAR MANY HATS. ACTRESS, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, DIRECTOR. BUT WITH THESE NOMINEES, I GET TO WEAR A NEW ONE. "ELDER STATESWOMAN."

[CRYING] Announcer: HE'S THE CREATOR OF THE PHENOMENON KNOWN AS "HAMILTON" AND COMPOSER OF THE UPCOMING FILM OF HIS OWN MUSICAL "IN THE HEIGHTS," HERE'S LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA. IT'S NO SECRET. SONGWRITING IS MY BLISS. WHEN THE RIGHT WORDS MEET THE RIGHT MUSIC TO TELL A STORY, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN THE FINAL CREATION IS OUTSTANDING, WHEN IT'S POSSIBLY ONE'S FINEST WORK, THE WAVE OF PRIDE AND SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IS INDESCRIBABLE. THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT'S NOMINEES FOR BEST SONG ARE FEELING. THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SPOTLIGHT EACH OF OUR NOMINEES ONE BY ONE BEFORE WE HEAR WHICH IS THE CRITICS CHOICE. OUR FIRST NOMINEE FOR BEST SONG IS "HUSAVIK (MY HOME TOWN)" FROM "EUROVISION SONG CONTEST: THE STORY OF FIRE SAGA." MUSIC AND LYRICS BY SAVAN KOTECHA. RICKARD GORANSSON AND FAT MAX GSUS.

IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THEY DELIVER COMPELLING STORIES AND TOP-NOTCH PERFORMANCES FROM ACTORS WE'RE OFTEN USED TO SEEING ON THE BIG SCREEN. AND WHEN THEY'RE OVER, WE CHECK AND CHECK AGAIN, HOPING THAT WE MISSED AN EPISODE. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF A MOVIE MADE FOR TELEVISION OR LIMITED SERIES. THEY ALWAYS LEAVE YOU WANTING MORE. AND SO DO THE ACTORS WHO STAR IN THEM. HERE ARE THE NOMINEES. ALL THIS IS GOING OUT OF THE HOUSE TODAY. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. AN ACCIDENT? THAT'S WHAT WE SAY. THEY ARE THE OTHERS. LINDBERGH IS THE OTHER. I DON'T THINK... PEOPLE LIKE ME. THEY'VE GOT THE UPPER HAND NOW. NOT FOR LONG. SIGH CAME BACK WHICH MAY BEEN SELFISH BUT I WANTED MY FAMILY BACK. I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.

WHAT'S THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE? FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE IS "REPO MAN" FROM 1984. EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE DELIVERS THESE WEIRD COMEDIC LINES 100% SERIOUS WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN FUNNIER. FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN MY OPINION. "THE CASTLE." I'M NOT -- I DON'T KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA WOULD KNOW THIS. IT'S AN AUSTRALIAN FILM. FUNNIEST MOVIE FOR ME, I WOULD SAY "BRIDESMAIDS." I WASH IT PROBABLY TEN TIMES. I LOVE SEEING THIS HILARIOUS GROUP OF WOMEN GETTING TO JUST BE OUTRAGEOUS. I THINK THE FUNNIEST MOVIE FOR LAUGHS FOR ME WAS PROBABLY RICHARD PRYOR, LIVE IN CONCERT. THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT IN HIGH SCHOOL. FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE IN MY OPINION, I CAN'T JUST PICK ONE. IT'S LIKE PICKING YOUR FAVORITE FAVORITE PIN PRINT PRINCE SONG. NINE TO FIVE, COMING TO AMERICA. Taye: HE'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND RESPECTED ACTORS IN THE WORLD. HERE'S OSCAR WINNER MORGAN FREEMAN. HELLO, EVERYONE. I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO PRESENT THE CRITICS CHOICE AWARD FOR BEST COMEDY FILM. YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT COMEDY IS TRAGEDY PLUS TIME, AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOST TRAGIC MOVIES I'VE STARRED IN OVER THE YEARS, THEY ARE COMPLETELY HILARIOUS NOW. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION? A DELIGHTFUL BUDDY COMEDY ABOUT A GUYS' TRIP TO MEXICO! MILLION DOLLAR BABY? A FALL-DOWN COMEDY WITH A REAL RUSH OF ADRENALINE. SEVEN? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S IN THE BOX. NON-STOP LAUGHS! NOW HERE ARE THE NOMINEES FOR BEST COMEDY FILM. WE ARE GOING TO DO A SPRAY TAN. HOW DARK IS SHE WANTING TO GO? WHAT COLOR IS BEST FOR A RACIST FAMILY?

I HAND THE BABY TO SOMEONE SO I COULD TIE MY SHOE AND MY HUSBAND WAS LIKE, DO YOU KNOW HER BUT IT'S A BLACK WOMAN. WE ARE FAMILY. COULD YOU PUT A COUPLE STARTLING, DISTURBING SENTENCES IN IT? THEY DON'T NEED TO BE TRUE. JUST SOMETHING TO JOLT THE AWAKE. APPARENTLY CANNOT JUST GO UP TO POTENTIAL SUITORS AND GO WHAT'S UP, MARK? SOME GUY TOLD ME GOES INTO THE HEAD, LOCKS ONTO A FEELING. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I'M GOING TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE THAT. THAT'S HOW BRAND MARKETING WORKS AND FASCISM. ALUMINUM. WHY WOULD YOU SAY ALUMINUM WHEN YOU CAN FLIRT IT. STOP IT, AMERICA.

HERE ARE THE NOMINEES FOR BEST DRAMA SERIES. TO YOU, THE COMMONWEALTH IS SOMETHING OF A DISTRACTION, A WASTE OF TIME. IN MANY WAYS, I HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE TO IT. ISN'T TRUMP PRESIDENT? NO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DIANE? YOU ARE SO ARROGANT YOU THINK YOU CAN FLIP AND FBI AGENT. YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THAT SOUNDS? IS A CRAZIER THAN KILLING SOMEONE? FIND TRUTH AND SEEK JUSTICE. YOU CANNOT SEEK JUSTICE WITHOUT FIRST KNOWING THE TRUTH. HE WAS SMALLER, HE TOOK THE BRUNT OF IT. I SHOULD HAVE PROTECTED HIM MORE. I ALWAYS FORGET THAT. I WAS YOUNGER AND SMALLER TOO TOO. EITHER WE END THIS NOW AND ENJOY THE TIME WE HAD AND GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. OR WHAT? IF I HAD BEEN THERE I WOULD'VE WALKED THROUGH LITERAL FIRE AND PULLED THAT MAN OUT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LIKEWISE. GOOD TO TALK TO YOU. Taye: I'M GOING TO READ YOUR LIPS BECAUSE I'M NOT GETTING ANY SOUND BUT AS LONG AS YOU CAN HEAR ME, WE ARE GOOD. FOR YOUR ROLE, DID YOU DO ANY TYPE OF RESEARCH? I DID. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME OR NOT. THE ROLE REQUIRED LEARNING A LOT OF SKILLS. I HAD TO LEARN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. I ALSO HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE DRUMS. THOSE TWO THINGS WAS A EIGHT AND A HALF MONTH PROCESS, FULL-TIME EVERY DAY. WEEK IN, WEEK OUT. QUITE INTENSE. IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS GRATEFUL FOR. LEARNING THE DRUMS AND LEARNING SIGN LAY WHICH KIND OF CHANGED ME AS A PERFORMER AT A PERSON. IT OPENED ME UP IN NEW WAYS. Taye: ALL RIGHT. YOU WOULD BE PROUD OF MY LIP READING RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A RAPPER. DID YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE DRUMS? HOW DID THAT WORK? I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE DRUMS AT ALL. WE DO MAKE MUSIC AND I THOUGHT STUPIDLY IT WOULD MAKE PLAYING THE DRUMS EASIER BUT KEEPING RHYTHM IS DIFFERENT TO COORDINATION THE KIND OF DRUMMING THAT WE WERE DOING WAS A BLAST BEATS, DOUBLE PEDDLING, USE ALL FOUR LIMBS IN DIFFERENT RHYTHMS. IT'S REALLY, I BLAME OUR AMAZING AND INSANE DIRECTOR WHO SAID EVERYTHING IN THIS FILM I WANTED TO BE AS REAL AS POSSIBLE. WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THE DRUMS ON SCREEN, I WANT YOU TO BE REALLY PLAYING THE DRUMS IN FRONT OF A REAL AUDIENCE, REAL NIGHTCLUB AND A REAL GIG. WE HAD TO GO ON THAT JOURNEY OF FORMING A BAND AND REHEARSING AND LEARNING THE INSTRUMENTS. Taye: ALL RIGHT, KEEP DOING YOUR THING. WONDERFUL WORK.

I AM HERE TO PRESENT THE CRITICS CHOICE FOR BEST TALK SHOW. AND, I HAVE TO SAY, THIS TALK SHOW FORMAT REALLY HAS EXPANDED SINCE I WAS HOSTING MY FIRST SHOW.

IT'S FITTING BECAUSE MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE MY EARLIEST CRITICS. THAT'S HALF TRUE. MY DAD IS A CRITIC. MY MOM IS VERY SUPPORTIVE. SHE IS LIKE AN AGENT. ALL SHE EVER TELLS ME IS THAT I'M CRUSHING IT AND SHE'S TAKING 10% OF EVERYTHING I'VE EVER MADE MADE. [LAUGHTER] GOOD JOB. THEY DON'T HAVE A TV BACKGROUND. THANK YOU SO MUCH. REALLY FLATTERED AND HONORED. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU ARE A FAN OF "BRIDGERTON," YOU'LL KNOW SHE PLAYED DAPHNE BRIDGERTON IN THE WORLD-WIDE HIT. HI FROM LONDON. I'M PHOEBE DYNEVOR.

TO MY FELLOW PRODUCER WHO TOOK SUCH CARE OF THE RIGHTS FOR THOSE YEARS AND TRUSTED ME WITH SHOW. INTO MY OLD FRIEND AND PRODUCING PARTNER, BILL, FOR REALLY PROTECTING ME FROM MYSELF. I THINK IF THIS SHOW WORKED AT ALL, THERE WERE A COUPLE REASONS. ONE WAS THE GREAT NOVEL WHICH WAS AMAZING. A HUGE GIFT FOR ME TO USE THEM TO WORK FROM. I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO TURN IT INTO A FILM. I HOPE HE'S HAPPY, WHEREVER HE IS. IT WAS A REAL HONOR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND FINALLY, I DON'T THINK THE SHOW WOULD'VE WORKED NEARLY NEARLY AS WELL WITHOUT ANYA TAYLOR-JOY, WHO OWNED EVERY FRAME OF THE SHOW AND HAS A FACE THAT LAUNCHED A MILLION NEW CHESS PLAYERS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CRITICS CHOICE. THANK YOU. HERE IS THE FINAL NOMINEE FOR BEST SONG. IT'S FROM LEE DANIEL'S "THE UNITED STATES VS. BILLIE HOLIDAY."

WHEN THE 26TH CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS RETURNS. Taye: AS YOU'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE EVENING, THE CRITICS ASSOCIATION HAS TEAMED UP WITH SEE HER TO RECOGNIZE WOMEN WHO HAVE PLAYED A POWERFUL ROLE ON AND OFF SCREEN IN ADVANCING GENDER EQUALITY IN ENTERTAINMENT. OUR PREVIOUS HONOREES HAVE BEEN VIOLA DAVIS, GAL GADOT, CLAIRE FOY AND KRISTEN BELL. ALL AMAZING WOMEN. TO TELL US ABOUT THIS YEAR'S HONOREE, ZENDAYA, IS THE STAR OF "BLACKKKLANSMAN," "TENET," AND "MALCOLM AND MARIE." JOHN DAVID WASHINGTON. IN HER YOUNG TEENS, SHE WAS A DISNEY STAR. BY HER 20s SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE THAT IS FILMING HER THIRD SPIDER-MAN MOVIE. ALONG THE WAY, ZENDAYA BECAME A FASHION ICON AND THE YOUNGEST WOMAN TO END LEAD ACTRESS EMMY. DURING OUR MOVIE "MALCOLM & MARIE," WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME THE MOST BEYOND HER INCREDIBLE TALENT WITH HER WISDOM AND HER DISCERNMENT. AT 24 YEARS OLD, ZENDAYA IS ALREADY A FORMIDABLE ACTOR BUT SHE IS ALSO A FORMIDABLE FORCE FOR GOOD, FEARLESSLY USING HER VOICE AND PLATFORM TO PUSH FOR CHANGE, INSPIRING HER INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS. SHE BELIEVES HER GENERATION HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD. ZENDAYA, ICU. I SEE YOU. OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR. MEDIA IS A MIRROR TO THE WORLD. HAS THE POWER TO IMPACT CHANGE, INFLUENCE CULTURE AND REFLECT HOW WOMEN AND GIRLS SEE THEMSELVES. COME ON. LIFE IS ABOUT FINDING EXCITEMENT AND HAVING ADVENTURE. MEDIA CAN INSPIRE OUR WORLD BECAUSE WHEN SHE CAN SEE HER, SHE CAN BE HER. LED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS, SEE HER IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL MOVEMENT FOR GENDER EQUALITY WITH THE MISSION TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS IN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT SO THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS THEY TRULY ARE AND ALL THEIR POTENTIAL. I BELIEVE THE PRIVILEGE OF A LIFETIME IS BEING WHO YOU ARE. IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT I WANTED TO PORTRAY A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT WOMAN. OUR JOB IS TO QUESTION OURSELVES, WHAT WE DETECT, HOW WE DEPICT THEM AND HOW WE WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THEMSELVES. BEING A WOMAN IS NOT ABOUT BEING BRAVE OR STRONG OR POWERFUL. IT'S ABOUT GIVING YOURSELF PERMISSION TO BE THE THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY ARE. EACH YEAR THE CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS, SEE HER RECOGNIZES ONE WOMAN WHO EMBODIES THE VALUES OF THE MOVEMENT. I THINK IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL. TO PUSH BOUNDARIES, DEFIES STEREOTYPES, AND ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHENTIC PORTRAYALS. ON AND OFF SCREEN. USING HER VOICE AND PLATFORM TO INSPIRE OTHERS. YOU HAVE TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN AND MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY AND MAD BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH YOU YET. THAT'S THE WHOLE PART. THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? REALLY. DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE? YES. THIS YEAR'S SEE HER HONOREE IS ZENDAYA. LOOK AT ME. I'M THE LAST PERSON STANDING. HOLD ON TO ME FOR NEAR LIFE. IT'S MY GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT THE 2021 SEEHER AWARD TO SOMEONE WHO IS ON-SCREEN AND OFF CHANGING THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER. ZENDAYA. I'M GOING TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU SO MUCH TO JOHN DAVID WASHINGTON. INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS A FRIEND AND A SCENE PARTNER. THANK YOU TO THE CRITICS CHOICE ASSOCIATION FOR THIS INCREDIBLE HONOR AND SEE HER. THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. I WAS THINKING OF THINGS TO SAY, THE ONLY REAL THING I CAN THINK OF IS GRATITUDE. THIS WORD KEEPS COMING TO MY MIND, ESPECIALLY WITH THE YEAR THAT EVERYONE HAS HAD. TO CONTINUE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE MOMENT BIG AND SMALL. TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD AND IN OUR LIFE THAT MAKE THE WORK WE DO POSSIBLE, TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE HOLD ON TO OUR LOVED ONES A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER. MAKE SURE WE CALL THEM, ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AND TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM. AND TAKEN MOMENTS LIKE THIS AND I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT BE HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE INCREDIBLE WOMEN THAT HAVE PAVED THE WAY FOR ME TO BE HERE. EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WOMEN. YES, THIS IS VERY, VERY SPECIAL. THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH. NOT TO OVERUSE THE WORD BUT I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS MOMENT.
