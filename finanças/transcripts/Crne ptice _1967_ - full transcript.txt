A film by auteur group "Most" (the Bridge) Zagreb Like water I spilt My bones went dry My heart became wax it melted down in me... You're watching and I became a thing to watch... BLACK BIRDS Sixty. They also have 4 machine guns. - A thrower? - No. - 160? - Yeah. 160 left. Zoran, you'll go to Ivan's room again. Sixty. With 4 machine guns. Sixty more. With 4 throwers. A wagon. Wagon. They're carrying... They're left with around 40 people with 2 machine guns. It's time. Splendid. You're so much perplexed by this plan you forgot about patrolling with machine guns. Every patrol has submachine guns. - Who will get rid of them? - Night. Night, yes. Night will get rid of them. What do you think, how many days of travel they have? I don't know. Listen to what the old partisan has to say to you. This is how the battle sounds when it's 2 days away from here. It's time. Go to Marijan. Hm? Go to Robert and stay with him. Maybe something will happen. - Is that all? - Yes. Vladan... Go to the women and tell them about tomorrow. We'll give them a signal with the siren. Three short sounds. Nobody should escape from the yard before that. Now go. No. I don't get it, hm? Prepare. Food. Run. Run, run. Stop! I stopped. Who's there? Ustasha. Ustasha forward, the rest - stop! Engineer? Yes, Mr. Lieutenant? Engineer? Yes, Mr. Lieutenant? Engineer... the guys set up the dynamite according to your plan. Here. And here. And here, not yet. You'll do that, with your people, maybe even tomorrow. Watch out, engineer. When the train passes, the bridge should be completely destroyed. Understood? I understood. Today he didn't bother us. We were saved from biblical quotes. Wherever he finds them... Engineer... You're a reasonable man. One has to be reasonable. Reasonable... Come here, clown. Come. I'll teach you a couple of quotes. Come, come... C'mon. Help me God 'cause water rose to my soul. Help me God 'cause water rose to my soul. I'm falling in a hole without end. I'm falling in a hole without end. I'm drowning in the deep of water. I'm drowning in the deep of water. And waves are covering me. And waves are surrounding me. Covering. Covering. Pull me out from the mud, not to fall deeper. Pull me out from the mud, not to fall deeper. Save me from the ones who hate me. Save me from the ones who hate me. From the deep waters save me. From the deep waters save me. So the main stream flow wouldn't take me. So the main stream flow wouldn't take me. So the open sea wouldn't eat me. So the open sea wouldn't eat me. So the pit wouldn't swallow me. So the pit wouldn't swallow me. This is a last chance. Nothing can be expected any more. There are 40 of them. And us... 20 against one if we make an agreement. And then? Then we'll wait a few days until ours come. Who prepared that? We. Then why are you hiding in shadows? You don't trust us? These two are for the eastern patrol. If you don't hit it, we will need to attack the main door. Where are you going? Out. Sit there. Sit there! That's right. - Sit there. - Let me be. Let me be. Go in. Open. Open up. Calm down. Nothing is lost yet. Dear Lord, be the enemy of my enemies, attack those who attack me! Take weapons and protect, help me. Throw a spear, block the road to those who hunt me. Tell to my soul - I'm your saviour. Let them be ashamed, those who want my soul. Let them retreat - those who want to do me evil. Let them be a dust in the wind and let the Lord's angel hunt them. Let their path be dark and let the Lord's angel chase them off. Get Vladan here fast. You get Robert. We need a saw for iron, quick. Tell everyone the 12th is in the camp. They will know what that means. Guys, let us not loose our nerves. These are the crucial moments. You know they'll take our backpacks. Yes. One saw and one knife is enough per wagon. We'll arrange ourselves. It's better for you to stay together. We need to try in other wagons as well. What are you waiting for? You too go see Robert. They'll need you in the boat. I'd rather stay. I have found a place. I'll hide. You to want to go six feet under? I won't withstand. Robert is waiting and counting on you. We need you. Do you hear me? You'll go by the river to the bridge. If you let us go, you know what will happen. Marijan, I can't... Tell the women. Go! Look, there goes a day that burns like fire, and all the proud ones and ones without God will be like an empty field, they'll be burned by the day that goes, says Lord of Armies, He will leave them no root, nor branch, What's with you, Robert? You're left alone. No I'm not, Mr. Lieutenant. Yeah. Too many of you have spawned. And from where I only wonder. From the earth. You said it well. We sent you in the earth, from the earth you grow. And those from the river? Two boats tomorrow. Have you prepared everything? Everything Mr. Lieutenant. Why is Milan so late? They must have caught him. He's probably in the transport, but he will be useful there. He buried himself like a mole, I know him better than you. But people, where's Milan? Why is he so late? Stop! 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Is freedom on the other bank? No, only after the hill. Stop talking. Engineer, here's another one for you. Who will go with us? Choose one of yours, but he has to know about engine. 9, One with them will have to chase us, but with no more than 4 horse powers. You said 4... Where did Ivan go? Who's that? Engineer, you go now. C'mon guys, cheer up. And you, engineer, full speed ahead. - Say friend, do you know the pathway? - I sailed once here. If we strand, they'll catch us. We're going at full speed. We'll run away. Enough of yodeling. Two or three hours more. We'll get by night, to the first station. What's this? Shackles? I hope not. It would cost us a lot. What are you doing? What are you doing? Withhold them. We're all doomed if we don't withhold them now. - Back off if you love your life. - Back off, friend! Give it to me. Comrades. Comrades! Friends. Friends! Stop! Stop! This is our last hope! Repeat what you said. Repeat! Calm down. The night is long. There will be time for everything. Where is Lieutenant? Where is Lieutenant? Where is Lieutenant? We have passed one. Two more to go. Shall we wait? - Engineer? - Yes? You know them? Yes, Are these yours? Yes. Oh, my luck. Why did I have to meet you... And who do you belong to? To whom should I? To myself. Run! - They'll hear us! - Quick to the bridge. Slow down. Turn around. Speak! - They killed Luka. - And you didn't fight? They... Machine gun. Start. Faster. I gave full speed. Faster. You'll fly like an arrow. He's my brother. Don't shoot, you'll kill him. Enough. Enough! Back to your position. Take the rudder. Hold the middle of the river. Engineer. It'd be better if we jump into water. Someone will save himself. Sit. Hey! Hey! Hey! Where are your ustasha? - They are sleeping. - Wake them up! I must not. C'mon! - Wake them up! - Just a moment. I can't. They'll kill me. Don't move. Now. Go back to the boat, Zoran. Leave it be. Zoran. Zoran, don't give up. It's nothing. C'mon. - What is it? - I knew it.... What? Rain... Rain... It could be enough. - You think? - Look. Only if we could wait for the dynamite and our people don't go crazy. And if not? Then we'll jump one by one. Marijan, for God's sake, don't wait. Forest is near, we saw it. Stop talking nonsense, they'd caught us all in the daylight. And we're not finished yet. Friends, remember. When it dawns, we'll hear the explosion. Good luck. You don't say that. You only had 3 bullets. With the 3rd I missed you. In the wall. It dusted me. What are you waiting for? Shoot! I'll give you life if you call them. C'mon. Call them. You won't? You won't betray them? Congrats, brother. We need people like that. Listen. You killed both of my comrades, but here... Jump into water. Jump into water! Jump. I promise. I won't shoot. You won't? Shoot! - Shoot! - You won't? Then I'll slaughter you. You killed two of my comrades. - I have to punish you. - Shoot, I'm stronger than you. Don't blabber. Am... Am... Ambush... Help me God 'cause water came up to my soul. Hey, where are you going? He pulled out... Fire! Fire! The bridge... The bridge. Put me on the prow. That's it. They're here. C'mon. There they are. C'mon. Leave me, run! Lord, be the enemy to my enemies. Attack those who attack me. Lord, be the enemy to my enemies. Attack those who attack me. Take weapons and protect, help me. Throw a spear, block the road to those who hunt me. Tell to my soul - I'm your saviour. Let them be ashamed, those who want my soul. Let them retreat - those who want to do me evil. Let them be a dust in the wind and let the Lord's angel hunt them. Let their path be dark and let the Lord's angel chase them off. I'm going. - Where? - There. There's a hill behind the bushes. And you? I have to blow up the bridge. - You really have to? - I have to. The bridge leads to death. - You know very well what is across. - A lot of bridges lead to death. Who will blow up them all? I will this one? Who's in the train? Your brother? Your wife? They hanged... It's your fault. We should have helped when we were passing through the woods. Open! Open! Open! - The wagon will go... - Strength to escape... - Open. - Escape... Open! Comrades! The train will set off before dawn. They'll kill us all. - Where? Here at the station? - Wherever. Open. Open! - Are you crazy? - Back off. They're nowhere to be found. To hell with them... What is it, Blackie? See. That bridge... How do you think? What? That. It's not easy... ...to blow up the bridge. Yeah. Listen, Blackie... What did you say, what's your name? It's not important. The bridge is already mined. Everything except for the last part. Ustashe did it according to my plan. We need to tie the boat to the first pylon on the east side. We climb up a little, tie the fuse, fire it up, and everything goes in the air. Of course, we need to catch the boat first. Engineer. You want me to bring you a ustasha? Count to 100 and go. Ustasha! Ustasha! Ustasha! Ustasha! My leg is wounded. I can't come to you. I surrender! Ustasha! Auch! Ustasha! Auch! There. That's it. Finished. Engineer. Engineer, I'll do it by myself. You go to your men. They will need you. Can you do it? Huh? Can you? Of course. Well, then... Blackie, what's your real name? You don't need to know. You screwed up again. But you won't get away with it this time. Run, engineer. Run. Someone's swimming in the river. Be patient until our men attack the ustasha wagon. Why wait! Let's run away! Not yet. Listen. Stay. Wait. Stop. Brothers ran away. They left us alone. Don't Marijan, don't. Marijan.... Open all the wagons. Stay with me. Faster. Come out, comrades. Fast! - Where's Vladan? - I don't know. Have you seen Vladan? Marko, where's Vladan? Vladan. Vladan? Alive? Vladan? Alive... There, where two or three of you will find yourself, and say the name of ustasha, I will be with you. What is it, Vladan? What is he saying? I don't understand. Vladan... Like water I spilt myself, all my bones got dry... My heart became wax. It melted down in me... You're watching, and you've made an object for watching out of me...
