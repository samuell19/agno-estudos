I offer thanks to thee, oh Lord almighty, for You have mercifully restored my soul... Yes? -Is he here? Not yet. -Has the plane landed? Yes. I've been waiting for 30 minutes. He better show up! Are you sure he's coming? -He confirmed he got the ticket but you know him... -He knows it's a matter of life and death? Yes, Tali, I told him. -In those words? -Maybe not in those words. -Then you should have! Tali, I can't force anyone to do something they don't want, not even my son. Correction: especially not my son. Maybe if you weren't so hard on him... Shlomo, don't start. Hold on. -What's going on? Shlomo, I'm going crazy... -Boy wonder is here. You'll tell her holiness? -Yes. Make an appointment for tomorrow, time's short. Mom, we agreed you'd call only in the evenings. -Anati, I'm sorry but... Your dad is here. -What? why? -I'm as surprised as you are. He heard you're getting married. -Suddenly he cares? He's still your father, he's excited for you. I don't buy it, I don't believe him. -Anati, it's important for him to see you. Really. This is bad, very bad... Israeli Arabs will protest the police trying to prevent them from praying on the Temple Mount. Haled El Batash, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad... Forgive the mess. I wanted to bring the cleaning lady in but I had patients and the vacuum cleaner's noisy. You're still seeing patients? -Only one couple now There's that family law judge, Shimon Levi, we served in the army together now there's a new law, mediation before divorce. Doesn't pay much, but it's nice to help people when we can. Let's put the suitcase in your room. Why is the world called "world?" From the Hebrew word for "hidden". This world hides the essence of God and presents us with distractions and temptations. Even at the most difficult times, when the world distracts you the most... Yes, Shachar? Forgive me, I know you're busy. What is it? -Not over the phone, let's meet. I'm in class, just tell me already. -I'll be outside the yeshiva in 10 minutes... I'm really busy and I have a gig tonight. Is it crazy urgent? -Yes, but I don't want to interrupt your holy studies... Just come out when you can, I'll wait. Well? What is it? -My father is coming to the Vort (engagement). Anati, in a few weeks we'll be husband and wife. With all due respect to your father... -I have no respect. -Hey! "Honor thy mother and father." -You're right, may God forgive me. You see what a bad effect he has on me? He'll ruin everything. -How? Maybe it is another test? -I don't know. And I don't understand why he chose to come now of all times. I don't know what to do. What should I do? -Anat, we're strong, you and I, thank God. When tested we have to persevere. Talk to God, pray in solitude. Everything will be fine. Withstand your tests as I withstand mine. The rabbi said, "Every evil man has some good in him." The rabbi obviously doesn't know my father. Good evening. You realize that if your father and I ask for your help, we must have exhausted all other options. Your father thought you're the only psychologist she might talk to. Tali, my father is much better than me at direct interface. He probably didn't tell you that he and Anat are not talking. As much as he loves her, he considers her turning religious a slap in the face. A betrayal of his values. They just argue and yell. It's awful. They don't want to see each other. It will end in a rift with all of us. Even with me. And when she'll have kids, which will be real soon, she won't let me see them. Heaven forbid I don't... lead them astray. Do you know the guy she's marrying? Shachar? Don't you know anything about your daughter? Tali, I didn't come here to fight. -They met a few years ago. He was into drugs - got her into a wild lifestyle. A year ago he found religion and she followed him. This is our last chance to save her from herself. And you got to pull this off use every dirty psychology trick in that sick mind of yours and stop this wedding from happening. Lord... I'm talking to you because I'm terrified. It feels weird to talk to you out loud, I feel like an idiot. I know he's here because you willed it for a purpose and like Shachar said, maybe it's a test, but it's ruining the joy of my wedding and I don't know what you expect of me. I've had it with you two and that judge! You're just two white pat... Patriarchs! You cover each other's asses and I'm just a piece of trash, right? Who are you to judge me? and criticize my motherhood. Do you have any idea what it's like to be a mother?! -Sari, we won't solve anything... Don't touch me, Rami. I'm no idiot and I'm not insane. I won't let you play me. No more. You see what I'm dealing with, Doctor? Sari, you can't leave, we have a court order! If you're not insane, don't act like you are! Dad? Are you alright? 50 years in this profession, you'd think you've seen everything. Why aren't you dressed? It's noontime. Aren't you going to see Anat? Excuse me? I'm looking for "Love of Grace" seminary. "Love of Grace" I like your hair like this. How are you? -Thank God. Good thing you came on time, I have duty today. Rachel in the role of the loved one, Leah in the role of the mother, the Sages say they are: "Like two beams that hold up mankind." Like I said, I respect what you're going through, it's important to explore and examine... I explored enough. The Torah is not a puddle that dries up, it's an ocean. I am not exploring. If you're going for psychological deprogramming like Grandpa, don't even try, it's a waste of time. -I'm sorry, exploring isn't the right word. Anati, I know I wasn't exactly father of the year. -That's for sure. You're older now, we can open it up. I was wrong to visit so rarely in recent years. We'll meet whenever you want and talk about it. -Forget it. You don't remind an offender of his transgressions, there's nothing to talk about. And I have a lot to do until the Vort, and the Le'chaim is one week after that. I'm sorry, I don't know the difference between the two. The Vort is when the parents and families meet and Le'Chaim is the signing of the engagement deed. -Oh. Forgive the question, but... Why the rush to get married? You're young. We've been together for 2 years and we've been through a lot. We finally found peace and direction. Anati, your mother and I were too young when we got married. Well, you and I, we're different. Actually, when you were little, everyone said we're so alike. They were dead wrong. Yonatan, you don't have to convince her to abandon religion, the crucial issue is the wedding. Focus on the groom. If she'll get married there will be a child and another and another. And then, when the groom's faults surface... There will be a custody battle much worse than that couple you saw this morning. You're a smart guy, and good at observations. Observe him up close, study him, his body language, see if he has a hidden agenda. Who said he has a hidden agenda? -Don't be a wiseass, everyone does. Sometimes it's so hidden they're not even aware of it. Watch the chicken so it doesn't burn. Hello? Good evening to you too. "Shachar..." Sari, the law demands that both of you attend the meeting tomorrow. And I'm obliged to do my best to help you and write down my professional opinion. Stop what you're doing Undress and shut the door I won't say a word Babe, forgive me my body understands another language Listen to the silence Let me reach out The body responds best when it's pliant I'm a slave for an hour... Teach me to accept when I'm in pain To open up my heart Show me how I lack for nothing Teach me to breathe... I asked you to watch over the chicken! -I'm sorry. Nothing has changed. -I'm a bit tired... Sorry, I apologize. -Alright, alright. Take responsibility for once. So, where were we? Oh, listen to this. Speak about the devil that just called. -What devil and who called? That woman who threw a fit this morning, she's belongs to a pagan cult. Pagan? In Jerusalem? -Yes, I'm serious. This cult is affecting their relationship and they have a child too. Didn't you publish a piece about cults in "American Psychologist?" Maybe you can help. I can ask the judge to approve a consultation. Dad, I haven't seen patients in years. -Then get back to it, what do you say? We'll work together. Every father's dream. You don't want word to get out that Shlomo Abadi has lost it, that he has one foot in the grave. Yonatan. Yonatan... Come on, let me sleep. -Get up, get up. Get up, lazybones. I cleared the desk, the coffee's ready. Let's go over the files before I introduce you to the patients. Obviously they have to agree to you working with them, but I'm sure... Wait, hold on, what files? -That couple we talked about. They'll be here at 12. Today? I didn't say I would. -So? It's work. What complicates matters is that there's a child involved. They each want full custody. The courts tend to award full custody to the mother. But here the mother is unstable, A potential danger to the child. Yonatan, what's your preferred setup? Behind the desk? Across from the sofa? Whatever's more comfortable. -Dad, let me finish my coffee, okay? Regulations say you can drink your coffee and check out the desk. Come, sit. This woman, Sari, she's from a religious family. She rebelled, had a falling out, decided to leave the faith... she met the husband, they had a child and then she joined this cult. I think they're here. Good day. -Whatever. -Hello, Doctor Abadi. -I was thinking... Yonatan... Yonatan! -Who's Yonatan? This is Dr. Yonatan Abadi. He's my son, but we won't hold that against him. He's an expert from Princeton University. -I don't teach there anymore, but thanks. Because he's doing greater things, he published 3 books. Only the first was a success. -He's modest. In any case, I think this man can help you very much. A child that makes you proud is the greatest joy. Absolutely. So, Rami, Sari. What do you say? -Any help we can get. I'd be happier if he was a female psychologist, I'd feel much more at ease. -Sari, I told you, you can ask the judge to replace me. -And replace himself with a female judge while he's at it? It's nice, but a bit too revealing, I want something more modest. I can sew that up for you. -Great, thank you. -You're so beautiful. The gown looks so beautiful on you. This is what a modest Jewish woman looks like. The jewel in the crown. Beautiful, modest, a delight to her parents... And to their credit card company... -What? Mom. -What? -Stop with the insinuations. -What insinuations? I just... She wants to sell and... she's saying what you want to hear, I respect that. It's not cheap, but, I respect that. Is the veil ready? I'll be right back. With all due respect to modesty, you have to breathe, okay? These sleeves are too puffy, they're not long enough... But it's summer! So they don't cover the... I'm not talking about that, the length isn't modest. Any more modesty and he won't know you're a woman. Don't start. -Okay, I won't. This is very special. Double fabric, imported from Italy. -Wow. It costs double too. What's this? Does that go on the head? The face? Like a hijab? Anati, this is too much, it hides your face. Can I have a glass of water, please? -Sure. What? -You promised. No arguments, jabs, or talking about my past. we're not there anymore. -I want you to be honest with yourself. I don't want you to repeat my mistake, you'll ruin your life. -I am not making a mistake. I don't want you to be upset with me, but we both know you're not marrying an innocent lamb... Shachar's faith is strong we want a family and a life based on absolute truth. Absolute truth... -I'm done talking about it. Here. -Thank you. Blessed are You, oh Lord.. -Amen. Did your father brief you? Are we going on a mission in Syria? You think what's happening to your daughter is funny? I don't know why you and my father think that I can... You can expose his weakness, but to do that you have to focus on him. Why can't you be the conniving asshole you used to be? I don't get it, you're like some zombie. Do me a favor, stop focusing on your own problems, okay? What problems? Come on, Yonatan, I'm a thorough gal. Don't you know me? I look into everything. I know about the lawsuit and the dirt. Let's go, we don't want to be late. Don't worry, I won't tell your father. -There's nothing to tell. It's a load of bull. In the end we understand a lot Heaven is waiting We mustn't let go We must become strong together And utter only what is good and beautiful If it were just us two what would happen Who would give in, who would persevere who would leave How about we ease the pressure how about we cleanse ourselves Did you see something? -I don't know yet. Have you met him? -Yes, when Anat lived at home. He gave her a hard time. He kept leaving her and coming back. The man is troubled. bad taste in men must be genetic, huh? isn't it forbidden to perform for a mixed crowd? No, men are forbidden from hearing women sing, not the other way around. Anat says he does it to bring the Orthodox and secular together. He thinks he's so special, performing for secular audiences so they see how righteous he is. In the end we only remember the choices of the heart Meanwhile we just try to beware Not to show fear Lest it arouses… I don't get the plan. -There's no plan, we improvise. They'll go for a drink after the show and we'll look for something incriminating, women, booze... There. Girls, no touching the man by Jewish law. -Thank you. Wait, I have to make a call. -Now?! It'll only take a minute. -What? Is she pregnant? Make it fast and quiet, say you're busy. -Okay. Do you mind? Hey, Diana, sorry I didn't get back sooner... -Schreiber sent some documents for you to sign and your doorman told him you're out of the country? I'm in Israel, sorry I didn't let you know. -In Israel?! Now? Jonathan, this lawsuit can go from civil to criminal in a heartbeat! And if it does... -It won't, Diana, please, We should not be discussing any of this on the phone. Yonatan, we're losing them, come on. -I gotta go, I'll call you back tomorrow. Hold on! Don't hang... -Are you done? Is there anyone in this world that doesn't hate you? -Let's go. -Put it on mute! -Fine. Who's Diana? The girlfriend? -No, a colleague. It's business. Monkey business? -Tali, come on... Yonatan... Check out the blonde closing in on our righteous man. He doesn't seem interested. Play us a Shachar song! -Yeah, Shachar... Where I grew up, women weren't allowed to look men in the eye, they couldn't talk about their period, or lock the door, read books, watch movies... Everything was forbidden. I once told my father I want to go online to check out a news website, to open my mind. What did he say? "Sari, "first you open your mind, then you'll open your legs.” What a disgusting man. Is he here? To what do we owe this honor? I thought we're not talking. Grandpa, I don't have time to fight, tonight's the Vort, I have to talk to him. Your father is in a session, he has another right after that. Can you ask him to come out? -No. You can wait. "No?" -"No" means you can't burst in here and take over. "No" means that people do things other than study Torah. I got it, thank you. Have you lost your mind? This is my turf. -Fine. What's with the violence? I thought you're all about righteousness, grace... you're annoying. Let me talk to him. not now! And even God won't help you, you hear me? Tell him to come to the seminary when he's done or I'll never talk to him again. -Alright. This cult sanctifies the feminine, female sexuality, woman as the source of life, all powerful They do strange rituals, with knives and she got our son involved… -Hold on. Do you know this for a fact? See for yourself. They have... this theory that to attain total independence they must shatter all the norms established by men Sari is prepared to sacrifice everything, Including our son. Fast forward to 20:00. Way to go! You're the psychologist, why tie up a child like that? We're only tying this rope... And everything is great, right? Maybe it's a game. -Does it look like a game to you? Who's my big boy? Who's mommy's big boy? Tell me the truth, what were you doing in that bar? You better not lie to me. You're marrying a man I don't know, so naturally I'm curious... So said the man who is so curious about my life, who sends me an email once a month and visits once every few years. Are you here to ruin this for me? You have an evil inclination to destroy things. Do you know how it feels when you realize your father doesn't care about you? One night you tuck me in and tell me not to fear the dark and the next you're gone. How many times have I thought, just get this nightmare over with, this black hole in my heart. Anati, please... Anati, please... Don't touch me. Stay away. You want me to jump? Is that what you want? Just get this saga over with? You came here as if you're a real father. No problem, let's see the act through. Come to the Vort tonight, come to the Le'Chaim next week, eat your drumstick, then disappear back into your life, but don't try to crawl back into mine, okay? Daddy! It's an amazing buy, not only because the apartment is fabulous. Elisa... Elisa, I have an urgent call, is it okay if Baruch gets back to you about the balconies? Thank you. Yonatan, hold on. Baruch, close this deal or... Yonatan... -Tali, She's furious. -Oh, he told her. -You have no idea. I hope you properly lied. -I think we should drop this, Tali. -Drop what? The whole thing. -What are you talking about? Think of everything she saw at home as a child, the example we set. -The example "we" provided her? We?! -Listen... -Tell me, don't you regret leaving your daughter? Doesn't it kill you sometimes? More than sometimes. -Cut the crap. I'm leaving for Jerusalem in an hour and picking you up at 19:30 and don't you dare say "drop it" again. You can scan the pictures and save them on the computer. And then no one will see them. I like touching the photos, they feel more real. I started organizing them when Mom was still here. You look good. -Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come to the Vort? -Look how cute you were. Dad... -No, I don't want to come. Look at this place. It's terrifying. Look! This is going to be her world. It's making me crazy. I can't take it, Yonatan. -Tali, calm down. There she is. -I can't handle this, Yonatan... -Please... Welcome. -It's good to see you smiling. This is great. Mom, it's customary to say congratulations. What's wrong? Mom, stop, what's wrong? I'm sorry, Anat, I don't want to cry but this is killing me. -Tali, please... I had this whole strategy worked out how to survive this. Okay, but it's not smart. -Okay. It's all good. -Alright. She's alright. At first we were shocked too, but finding faith saved him. Before this we had years of trials and crises. Did you have issues with Anat? -Uh... yes, there always are. Yes, but Shachar's problems became medical... It passed from his soul to his body. For years he suffered from terrible back pain and now, thank God, he doesn't even need meds. He's totally healthy. -Shachar, sing us a song. Torah of mine, forgive me, please talk to me I don't have the strength to do much but I do have hope That it's another path like madness Like love That begins with pain And ends in redemption follow me Heal everything and promise me... Excuse me a second, Mom. -Sure... I appreciate that you helped out with Mom. I know this isn't easy for you. Shachar's family is nice. -Very nice, praise the Lord. And I'm very impressed that you tore yourself away from work for 2 weeks. Actually I am working, helping your grandfather on a case, a weird divorcing couple. weird is normal for psychologists, isn't it? Yes, but the wife is in a cult, worships idols. Worships what? They have all these rituals and there's a child involved. The husband says the boy may be in danger. -Why? Has she done anything to him? I don't know yet. -And who watches out for this boy? I work with the parents, children are a different expertise. You don't have to be an expert to help a child. It's not right. It's not the child's fault that his parents are messed up. Hey, thanks for coming. I think that if you observe Izzy you'll see signs. It's not that he raises hell, but there's this quiet about him like he's hiding something. We're working in the garden. Your wife is okay with me seeing the boy? -Sure. Interesting, huh? It's painted by nuns in a convent in East Jerusalem. It's dangerous, I even carry a gun when I take tourists there. They love it, they buy paintings, I get a small commission. How are you, Izzy? You're watering the plants very nicely. What are you growing? -Cucumbers. Do you like cucumbers? -Pickles. Pickles? Me too. -We pickle them, Izzy and I. I'll give you a jar. We make the best pickles ever, don't we, Izzy? Izzy, Izzy... Tell Yonatan where pickles first appeared in history. In ancient Greece. -Right... And which Greek philosopher loved pickles? Aristotle. What areas did Aristotle study? Physics, astronomy, logic, politics. I told you, he's a prodigy. Look. Does this seem normal to you? There's more. I didn't want to do this, but you have to see this. Where are we going? -You'll see. A judge doesn't understand the danger, because "Idol worshipper" sounds like a joke, and it does sound stupid, but here, in Jerusalem, they used to sacrifice children to the goddess Asherah. Did you know Asherah appears in the Bible 18 times in connection with sacrifices? That was thousands of years ago. Is this her room? -Yes, but she's at work. Did she give you permission to show me? No, but you have to. -No, I don't have to. It's an ethical violation. I understand but a child is in danger. I told the judge, but he won't come here to see for himself and you know how it is, judges are overworked, but if you include this in your report… -What are you doing?! What's going on here?! Who gave you permission?! Sari, you're sick and you need help... -I'm not sick, you psycho, bastard, liar! Sari... -Is nothing sacred to you?! -Sari... We had an agreement and like a psycho, bastard, liar he can't respect that! Sari, I thought you knew I'm coming. -Sure! Sure! Your father's a bastard, you're a bastard and all the bastards work together! I'm done with you, Rami, kiss your life goodbye. Get out of my house! The Temple Mount is Mount Moriah, which is where Abraham took his son Issac, and where the First Temple and the Second Temple stood. This is the most sacred place to the Jewish people. This mountain that also houses two Muslim temples, Al Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock, is the third most sacred site in Islam... Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad! Why are you shouting? Why am I shouting? You frightened me. How was the visit? -No good, I got mixed up in something I shouldn't have. I don't get what's going on there. I told you, I'm out of practice. I should drop the whole thing. -Drop it? This thing gives you an advantage. Now you can shift from defense to offense, you can call in the troops. What are you talking about? What troops? Tali told me that Anat showed an interest in your treatment of this couple. Are you listening? Keep her interested, start a conversation going… make a connection, and then you'll regain your influence.. No offense, Dad, but I'm not following. -I'll explain my idea, which is contrary to regulations, but there have been precedents. And before you say "no," promise you'll talk to Tali tomorrow. Why is a sandwich called "sandwich?" There was this nobleman, Lord Sandwich, he lived in Kent, England, and one day in 1660, which is how long ago? 357 years. -You're amazing. Lord Sandwich was... -Izzy, go wear your shoes, we're late. Put your shoes on. -What? It's "put your shoes on," not "wear." Right, Dad? Please put your shoes on in your room. Thank you. Sari, give me a minute. -I'm late for work. I'm sorry, but... this is very important. As messed up as we are and our marriage a failure, our son is very gifted... -Rami, I'm no failure. The only messed up thing I ever did was marry you. The lies you spread about me, how you set me up when you brought Dr. Abadi to see my room when you knew I was coming home, because you knew I'd lose it... -Fine. I'm telling you now, Izzy will grow up to be the exact opposite of everything you wanted him to be. Because I've had it with all the crap you fill his mind with. I'm sick of you trying to show him that his mother is an ignorant simpleton. But I'm just teaching him... -Cut the bull! I'll teach him the exact opposite. I'll scrub him so hard to remove your influence, even if it hurts. -Why do you say such things? What did I lie about? -What did you lie about?! You promised me a new life. And? I'm a maid at home and at work, just like my father planned for me. But I said you could stop working. But I wanted to work! I wanted to make my own money, not like my mother and you knew that. -Fine, I respect that, but if you don't want to, you don't have to work. You can study, improve yourself... -Improve myself? You want me to improve myself? Do you have any idea how insulting you sound? You listen to me, Rami. you can spend the next 2 days filling Izzy's mind with crap, in a few months he'll hate you, just like I do. I promise you that. -Sari, you're killing me. -No problem. Die. Izzy! Are you ready? We're late. Come in. Thank you. Great place. The sea breeze is nice Yes, it's a must to get away from Jerusalem and breathe some air. That city is stifling. Remember how we used to love taking Anati to the beach? You see? Not all our memories are bad. I'm glad. Should we go out to eat or order in? Sit here and talk? That idea might be useful, a way to connect with Anat, but why do you think she'll agree? -Because she's sensitive and brave and empathetic. I know my daughter. Especially if a child's life is at risk. Your "colleague" again? What's with you and this startup? You don't even know the cost of cheese how did you get dragged into this? -I developed this method to assess personality in... let's say... job candidates, and predict their odds of success Forget it. We have a much bigger problem. It's fine, I think it's a great idea. I would have invested. Sorry, did I wake you? No. You can't sleep either? Do you want a sleeping pill? No, thanks. Since Anati moved out I can't sleep without a sleeping pill. You can't imagine this void I feel just from the thought of losing her. Of being alone. Would you like a cup of tea? Tali, I'm not sure about our plan... -Yonatan, let's do it, let's take a chance. It's our duty to try to save her. If I thought it was dangerous I would never suggest it. You're our only chance to gain some influence with her, Yonatan. I'll convince her, you convince the wife, okay? Okay? Hodaya, more cucumbers. Anati. Whoa, I better watch the knife, huh? What's wrong? -Nothing's wrong. I just came to apologize for... bawling at the Vort. I hope I didn't embarrass you. You got a lot more slicing to do? It's weird having your dad around. But it was nice he was there for you at the Vort. -That's true. Especially now that he's having a rough time. -Why? What's wrong? He has problems in America. And... that couple he's seeing for Grandpa... Did he tell you about it? -Yes. I'm worried, he's not focused. The boy has a serious problem, he may be in danger. -I know, I told him not to leave before he solves this. But your dad isn't that familiar with the world this woman comes from, not to mention the world she's in. He has this idea that involves you, but since that incident on the roof of... the seminary... -He told you? Yes, but that's not the issue. He has an idea that could save this boy, It involves you. Me? -You. But he doesn't want to make another mistake with you doesn't want you to hate him even more, so he's afraid to suggest it to you. -What? I'm terrified. I'm terrified to think how many calories there are in this thing. Okay, what am I butting in for? He can talk to you if he wants. Mom, what's his idea? -I don't know, he can tell you. I'm sorry, I called a few times but you didn't pick up. Why would I? -I get why you're angry, I came to apologize. I'm glad, now get outta here, I have work to do. Please spare me 2 minutes. -I can't. Then I'll wait until your break. Please. 2 minutes, what do you want? I know I saw something that you don't want people to see, but I want you to know it wasn't my idea. -Yeah, that bastard, he wants you to think I'm insane. -I don't think you're insane. I'm here to help. But you have to let me in. Take me to the ritual. -Are you nuts? It's for women only. I have an idea. It's a bit out there. Out there is a good start. No, no... it's a bad idea. You saw how Sari can be, she's violent. It's unlikely she'll try to hurt my daughter. You don't know these people. She agreed to meet your daughter only to recruit her. -That won't be easy. Look. This is my daughter and her fiancé. -She's religious. -Yes. Her fiancé looks familiar. He's a singer. -No, I saw him recently, somewhere you don't usually see these guys. What do you mean? I'm pretty sure I saw him, I thought it was odd. Odd? I admit, I'm addicted to the longing And moved only when the heart aches So I may send you away Just for the longing I'm not about harsh feelings I know the flesh will fail the spirit I remember my father And how the tree fell close to the apple... No, no, stop, stop. I'm missing an instrument, you want to play too? Okay, 5 minutes. Wedding issues. Let's do it again without him. No way, I told you it's too weird. -What's weird? Pagans in Jerusalem? It's a joke. People think reborns are crazy, you want to prove them right? It's a load of bunk. -I don't think so, Shachar. A child's life is in danger. And you're the one to save him? You of all people? There are social workers for that. Social workers need clear cut proof of threat… -So tell your genius father to get proof. -He can't. A professional can't prove that she's psycho and you can? You're not doing this. -I'm obliged to, Shachar. We're talking about a child's life You said yourself, it's a test, so please, trust me. I don't want you to do this. It's only a few days until the Le'Chaim. The rabbi said you should spend time with the wedding night counselor. Shachar, unfortunately I could teach her a thing or two… I'm sorry, but this is very important. She can guess how I feel about idol worshipping, I won't lie. -So don't. Then why cross examine me? She wants to ensure you're trustworthy. That you won't dismiss or distort what you see, that will be the basis for my report to the court. -Why would I distort? The experience may rattle you. Anat, if you're not comfortable... -Of course I'm not. But we don't always do what's comfortable. That's her, I'll wait here until you're done. Hold on... She looks just like you. Look at me. Is that you? Tell me the truth, it's you. -Yes. My mom would say this is a sign. As soon as we enter the bar, there it is. this must be from a long time ago? -Yes, thank God. "Thank God"... "Thank God." They got you good, huh? What you're doing there looks like fun. That singer found religion, didn't he? What a waste, he's hot. Is that real, all the humping and grinding? You look like you're having a good time. On the contrary, I hate it. It brings back bad memories. It's a nightmare. He asked them to stop playing it but it's good for the record company. What did you want to talk about? -Your father said you have an illustrious past. I can see that. What were you like before you found religion? Shall I tell you how it came about? No, it's obvious, happy people don't turn to God. I want to be sure that you can see beyond your religious dogma. That people who are not like you do as they please. My opinion is irrelevant. I'm attending your ritual to report to my father what goes on in the truest, most accurate way, God willing. I don't get it. -What don't you get? A person like you, so deep into "God willing." Why? Why go back there? Is it to please Daddy? You love your father that much? Who said I love my father? And now we will take a short walk to Via Dolorosa first stop: the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Now, we must keep quiet in there, so I will point out now: the fresco of the binding on the southern wall is right across the fresco of the crucifixion. Now, what's the connection between Isaac and Jesus, anyone knows? Take your time. In both cases God asks for a human sacrifice. Let's move on, this way please. Hey, Tali. -What time is it? -Sorry, it's a little after midnight. I have potential news about the groom. We have something on that Shachar guy? -A lead. He uses a drugstore far from his Yeshiva. Jews hardly go there. Why there? It's a drugstore where you can buy prescription drugs without a prescription… Opiates, painkillers, that can be crushed and snorted. Just like cocaine. Our guy used to be a heavy user, Also, watching him the other night I saw signs of Oxycodone addiction. Itching, neck rashes... He swore to Anat he's clean, Tali. Swore. So... what does Anat hate most? Liars! She hates liars. Yonatan Abadi, you're the best! I mean... you got lucky. Yonatan, you have to tell her, she has to know: The man she's about to marry is still a junkie. It's just a hypothesis, not verified yet. He can easily deny it. -Hence, "By wise counsel thou shalt make thy war..." Dad? Dad? Dad. Are you alright? -I'm fine. What were you doing in the closet? -I wanted to grab a box and slipped. I'm not sure about the color, but it looks good on you. What? Oh... Wiseass. -Are you alright? Yes, get that box out. Take it out. Night vision goggles, a relic from my army reserve duty. I forgot to return them. As they say, Denial is not just a river in Egypt. -Do you think something can happen tonight? The odds of a car accident are low, still you buckle up. We'll be close by. The slightest problem, she calls and we're there. Now, where does the battery go? The car keys aren't on the table. -Where are you taking him? We've been down this road, it's none of your business. -It is, he's my son. And mine. When you take him on your tours and such, I shut my mouth, don't I? Where are the keys? Izzy... Izzy, come. Sweetheart, let's get your sandals on. Izzy, come. You can sleep in the car. Does she look nervous? You look nervous. Want a snack? I brought fruit. Snack? Seems to me you're enjoying this a little too much. There she is. Here. I bet no one at the seminary knows you're out. No, but Shachar knows, and my father. Will they call the police if they don't hear from you? What are you talking about? You're so tense. Remember when Mom and I would take you on car trips I used to sit you in my lap and let you hold the wheel? You used to close your eyes and say you're taking a nap... and I would panic. You know I didn't really close my eyes. Now you tell me? Where are we? Izzy... Come, sweetie. Sari? -Come on. Where are we? Let's go, darling. -Where are we? Come. You have to change clothes. -Why? Because you'll get dirty. -I don't mind. To participate in our ritual, you have to leave your everyday behind. That's the way we do it. -I'm only here to watch. No, you're here to understand, right? So put this on. Let's see... What are you doing? -It's beautiful. They're beautiful. -They're disgusting. Why don't you remove them? -It's forbidden. Do me up. By Jewish law one must not wound oneself. -Oh my. Religion can be exhausting, huh? Ouch. Wait, your phone. Give it to me. -Why? No photos, no disruptions. Hand it over. Today you are worshipping the goddess Asherah, so let's summon the power of death, the knife that ruthlessly cuts away all burdens. Without mercy, but with infinite compassion. it's time now to unmask, shed every lie and falsehood because the goddess is truth. Only truth. Stronger... Yes... Yes... I don't like this. You want to run in there and get her out? You'll only upset her. She's a big girl. Then why are we interfering in her life? No one ever said parenting is logical. Out of our own private redemption, and our collective redemption, a new world is born! And now that we are born to this new world it is our privilege and duty to make a blood offering. I urge you to enter the domain of fear... -Anat! Anat! -Darkness and danger. Well, Anat? You have the guts? -Who is not afraid? Come. -No. Come. -No! Seize her! -Seize her! Seize her... Seize her! -Seize her! When were we taught to be ashamed of our femininity? Our sexuality? When and how were we taught to diminish ourselves? What were you told as girls and young women that made you feel ashamed, guilty and scared? "Be pretty and quiet." -"Women are whores!" "Cross your legs, slut!" -"Be modest." -"You're worthless without a man." -"Feminist!" -“Obey your man!” "Shut your mouth, stupid!" -"You're not 16 anymore." Are you feeling suffocated? Stifled? Terrified? Shall we end it? -Yes! Yes? Shall we just end it? Yes? I hereby set you free! you and your children! From the binds of the past, The world is ready for redemption! Dad... Dad. Wake up. Wake up. Well, Anat, be honest. Was it so bad? No, but I don't think it's something a child should see. It's also very late. Didn't your parents ever take you to some late night event? because they thought it important? My parents are... difficult. -Whose parents aren't? Parents do what they think is best. So yes, it's late, but you saw for yourself, there was no sex or violence involved. I want Izzy to grow up in a world where women are empowered. But why like this? I care about women's rights as much as you, but why the idolatry? Are you nuts? Do you really think I believe in some rock? Sometimes it's necessary to free yourself from childhood indoctrination. -I understand. But the way you do it, isn't it a bit extreme? -What's wrong with being extreme? Waving a chicken over your head isn't extreme? ritualistic circumcision on a baby boy isn't extreme? And you call me extreme? Ask me. -What? About the scar, you're dying to ask. You have one too. When did you do yours? My Bat Mitzvah. My dad did mine. You want to know how? No. Do me a favor, there's a sweater in back, tuck it under his head. But gently, so he doesn't wake up. Well, Izzy, a quick quiz before kindergarten? The gates of Jerusalem, 5 gates wins. -Jaffa. -Yes. Damascus. -Yes. -Lions. -Yes. Flowers. -And...? -Mercy. What a champ. Hold on. The smartest kid in the world, but forgetful when it matters. This is what matters. I love you so much. My daughter was a bit shaken by the ritual. with all the drumming and yelling, but nothing there seems to pose a threat to the boy. But it's not good for the boy, we just said... good or bad, that's a different matter we're assessing if the child is in danger… there's no indication that he is. But... she put on an act. They put on an act to throw you off. -An entire ritual to throw us off? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion... You must realize what's going on... You don't want Izzy's fate on your conscience if you don't get him away from her… Think twice before you write that. Yonatan, let me... Let me. Listen, she may not be an ideal mother but taking a child away from a parent is difficult, and usually unwise. We therapists say: the parents are the threat and the parents are the hope. So it's best for this war to stop, for the boy's sake and yours. Yes. -Miss Alter? your Attorney says the evaluation has arrived. Abadi's evaluation? -Yes. he wishes to inform you that all is fine. what does that mean? - based on the psychologist's report, you're not a danger to your child. So there is no case, am I right? -Something like that. He'll call you... Wow, that girl really came through. Oh no. -"Oh no" what? You're not planning a comeback are you? Of course not. -Believe me, you don't want your grandchildren to go through what I did. So if you ever want to see them, you'll have to sign a guarantee. We'll sign whatever you want. Do you have time for coffee? A small one. Don't start crying again. -I'm done crying, only joy from now on, God willing. Here you go, fat free, kosher, soy, brown sugar and saccharin. Thank you. Well, guys, I'm busy, so please make it snappy. To what do I owe this honor? Though it's not easy, we wanted to say that we respect your choices, your path, your decisions and we don't wish to cause trouble. You're getting married. And I think... we think... that we should get to know... your future husband. That we form a relationship of two people who love you. Anati, a wedding is a happy event, a new journey no point hashing up the past. There's nothing wrong with your father meeting Shachar. Man to man, to get to know one another. Scratch their balls together. Oh, Anat... I'm kidding. It's time we switch modes. It's a wedding! A happy event, right? Very happy. You'll tell him that we know everything, and that he must tell her tonight. And if he won't confess, you stick this right in his heart. I'd love to see his face when you show him what's what. I hope we're doing the right thing, Tali. -Yonatan, don't be a wuss. You were showing some improvement for a while there... What's that? Adult male with chest pain, what's your ETA? It sucks. We promised our investor 85% accuracy with our software. And we did it. -Then what's the problem? He claims our data is doctored, 85%. That Diana and I manipulated the stats to keep the money coming beyond the development phase. -And? Did you? -Tali... Kidding, I'm sure you didn't... But who knows how the trial will end. Judges are unpredictable and lawyers are expensive. And I am broke. "Fraud" is a serious charge. It could turn into a criminal proceeding and end in prison. Okay, don't go back. The trial can take place without me. And Diana is stuck there... I recruited her for this project. That's her problem. It's business... -You can go in. Dad, are you alright? Some parts are, some aren't. I guess it would be unwise of me to buy green bananas. Stop. What did the doctor say? That she personally feels fine. Well? Did her holiness allow you to talk to boy wonder? Forget about that. There's work to be done before you go back to your fraud trial. My what? I didn't tell him, I didn't know he knows. It was his idea to bring you here for Anat, not mine. He's shrewd, that Shlomo. Shrewd? I don't use the computer that often but in better days Anat taught me this Google thing to look for your name... A father must keep an eye on his son. Yonatan, you know as well as I do how it works. When a child is born, two children are actually born, the one you hoped for, and the real one. At some point you have to choose between the two. You become very aware of the time gone by and the time that remains. It's hard to admit, but you start to stress, and think about what really matters. So know this, I love you. Very much. And I miss you. A lot. Oh Lord, please make the meeting between Shachar and my father go well, so that I can truly rejoice at the Le'Chaim and start a new life. There are great emotions in play... How are you? How are you? I know we don't have much time, but... I still think we should talk. After all, we're about to be family and... the most important thing for a family is communication. There are plenty more important things. Talk, I don't have much time. Shall we sit down somewhere? The cafeteria? -How about somewhere more private? We'll probably talk about private matters. I... -Congratulations. Thank you. Can we go sit somewhere? Whatever you have to say, say it here. I've been away for many years, but... I'm here now and I don't want her to get hurt again. Why would she get hurt? -Because she loves you. And love sometimes... blinds us. I'll never leave her. I'm not like you. Maybe, but there are other ways to hurt her. Like not being truthful… What are you talking about? Are you sure you want to do this here? What private matters are you talking about? You used to take painkillers for your back. These drugs are highly addictive. Oxycodon, for instance. I quit that a long time ago. Besides, Oxycodon requires a prescription... I hear there's a drug store in East Jerusalem where they can hook you up. What do you want from me? I'm going to tell you a secret about me. I'm facing a trial. It involves my startup venture. The plaintiff, an investor, says I rigged the statistics to bilk him for more money. And what really happened? -It's complicated. We doctored the data. We had no ill intent, it was only temporary. Now there's a trial. My partner and I made a liar's pact. I hate lying, but if we tell the truth, we could wind up in prison. But you're not lying to a judge or some shady business partner, you're lying to the person you love. I'm just trying to keep you from repeating my mistakes. I suggest you talk to her. Right away. Are you threatening me? Are you going to tell her? Okay, so I use drugs. I don't want to disgust her like I disgust myself. Why do you disgust yourself? -Because we're all disgusting, Yonatan. We're afflicted with sin. And when I stand on stage, singing, I'm terrified to convey something so pure through a filthy vessel like me. I can only let go of this thought when I'm on drugs. But it's different with Anati. I will never hurt her. My love for her is pure. I swear. What do you want me to do? Hello! Welcome. -What a happy occasion! Thank you. Hello, Anat... Is the groom here? Not here. Congratulations. -Hi, Tali. Nice of you to come. Yes? -Doctor Abadi? This is Sari Alter, it's urgent. -Hi, Sari. He's not answering his phone, his car isn't here, I called the kindergarten, they said he picked Izzy up. Did he say anything to you? I have no idea where he is. Hello? -Is Shachar there? Not yet. Which is good, maybe he'll simply vanish. Are you coming? -I'll be late. Why? -The boy and husband vanished, the wife's hysterical. What does she want from you? This is a police matter. I don't know but I have to go over there. Give me 30 minutes. Yonatan, Anat will be crushed, you remember her Bat Mitzvah... He's here. I want that bastard to look me in the eye! What are you doing? Go back. I just want to congratulate the groom. This is the men section. -Okay! I know it's men only. Go back! Go back to the women's section. -Don't come in! Big deal, one second. -Only men allowed here! What is this, a feminist ploy? Go back to the women's section! I called the police, those idiots. -What did they say? To wait a few hours. They don't realize that meanwhile... -Sari, hold on. He... -Sari, calm down, let's think, maybe they just went to the movies. -No! And why isn't he picking up? -Maybe there's no reception. That man is sick, who knows what he'll do? On the surface he seems fine, holding everything in, but then he explodes… Anati, please. I promise I won't lie again. Anati, please open the door. I'm really sorry... -That's all very well, now leave. -But she must understand. Go away and let me speak with my daughter. -Tali, please... Anat, open the door, let's talk. If a painful truth is revealed, better before than after the wedding. Believe me, I know. Anat, what happened? Mom, you know exactly what happened, don't play games. Your plan worked. Shachar is a liar, a jerk, but you're way worse. I'm so stupid to believe you. Anat, calm down. -Where's your car? -What? Where's your car? -In the lot... Anati! -Anati! Anati, please! I get that something happened between you two. -Cut the act, okay? This is exactly what I ran away from. You and Dad are such liars. We're liars? Shachar is the liar! This is what we were afraid of, we're trying to save you, but you are blind. Believe me, this hurts me much more... -You again?! Did you ever stop to think what'll happen to me? At my engagement party?! That I'll be a laughing stock? -Anat, calm down. -No, because you didn't care! And my cowardly father didn't even have the guts to show up. Your dad wasn't there because that woman's son is missing. Missing? -I don't know. Dad's with her now. It's his duty. -Since when does Dad do his duty? Go there now. It's in Abu Tor. -What for? -Just go. I don't get it, my son is missing, and I'm on hold. It hasn't been 24 hours yet. How come you didn't see this coming? What are you doing here? Mom's outside, she wants to talk to you. Is everything alright? -No, but isn't it what you wanted? Go, she's waiting for you. Come in. This is awful. I heard what happened, you must be freaking out, if there's anything I can do, if this is my fault... Your fault? Of course not. So he told her. And how. She's through with him. I could hug you now, even though I can't stand you. If she'll see me hugging you she'll hate us even more. That's not possible, she hates us to the max. -I know. But we did what we had to, she'll get over it, one day she'll thank us. -I'm not so sure, Tali. We did her a favor. -We did ourselves a favor, not her. What do you mean? -You didn't want to be alone, Tali. You were afraid of losing her, that's why you wanted Shachar out of her life. And you heard what my dad said. He didn't send me a ticket to come save Anat, He wanted me close, he's afraid of old age. And me? This was a great opportunity to run from my own troubles. I didn't come here to save our daughter. We didn't do her a favor, Tali. She has no reason to thank us. Ms. Alter... -I know it hasn't been 24 hours, but there are special circumstances, no? A child is in danger, doesn't that count? As I said, We'll send someone tomorrow morning. It's not right, they should be here. It's protocol. -What protocol? He took my child. We still don't know why he did it. One thing's for sure, these people work full time at pushing each other's buttons. -How can you even compare them? That man is a psycho, he's a threat to my child. You'll send someone in the morning?! How will I get through the night? I'm petrified… No, I don't care. I am asking you to trust us. Why won't you trust us? Because you cannot be trusted! Hey, Diana. Put the camera on. I wanna see your face. The reception will not be good, Diana. -Turn the camera on, Jonathan! I've been calling you for three days and you're not calling back, I wanna see your face! You're gonna ditch me and leave me alone to face this mess that you cooked up... Aren't you? Jonathan, please don't do this to me. Please, it's not fair. Please don't do this... When did you last see your son? -At 07:45, I took him to kindergarten, he was just fine, I haven't seen him since, the teacher said that Rami picked him up. So he must have him. -Are their passports in the house? Yes, but his gun isn't, he has a gun license, because he's a tour guide, What were you looking at behind the painting? Looking for the address of the convent where it was made. Rami told me he's friends with the nuns. You think he's there? -I don't know. It's in East Jerusalem, so... Where are you going? -In my pants, if I don't get to the bathroom. Can you unhook me? -It's not that easy. How about a bedpan? -So now I'm officially an old fart? What can you do? Do you mind? The phone. -Just a second. Please hurry. I'm trying to avoid an ”accident". Yes? -Dad? Yes, Yonatan. -How are you? Chirpy. -When are you being discharged? At noon, for good behavior. Is everything alright? -So so. Tell me, did Rami ever mention a convent in east Jerusalem? How is he? -He's fine. Anati, no point in both of us going, it's unsafe. I want to go. -Why? It's my job. I'm involved now. -Don't you trust me? Riots in East Jerusalem. Two policemen were injured, three demonstrators were shot In confrontations between Palestinians and the Israeli police The policemen were attacked with stones and Molotov cocktails... "Shachar" Can I say something about Shachar? -No. You're acting like a little girl. The little girl you told you'd always be there and then ruined her life? Anat, please. I talked to Shachar, I told him he should talk to you, but I didn't do it to ruin anything. -You're a liar. No, I'm not, I get what you see in him. The fact that he came clean... -He was afraid if he didn't, you would. He pretends to be so pure and righteous, but truth is... he's a liar. Don't get upset, your reaction is a bit extreme. True, he can't promise that he'll always do the right thing, but the standards you set are impossible. Some things are more important than the truth. Like love, or family. Or just knowing how to forgive. -Are you defending him now? Or are you talking about yourself? Wait, Anati, wait. Wait, Anat... Good morning. Is there a convent nearby? Perhaps down the road? Yeah, 100 meters down the road on the left. But cars can't pass. Thank you. It's down here, let's walk. But it's blocked. -Only to cars. You want me to leave the car here? Fine. How do you know Arabic? From the army? From Fadi, this Arab guy I dated. So what's worse? An Arab son in law or an Orthodox one? Hello. How can we help you? Do you speak English? -A little. We are looking for a friend of ours, Rami Alter, he came here with his son. No Ram here. Have a nice day. Please. We will wait here for ten minutes. If Rami is here and you don't want to say, we understand. But please tell him Dr. Abadi is here and it is very important they talk. Please, do not open the gate to anyone without calling me, okay? Excuse me, Are the gentleman and his kid in their room or at the library? At the library, I think. Is everything okay? Yeah, sure. Continue painting, thank you. Wait here. Don't come in. -But I want to. Anati, let me do my job. Wait here. If you hear yelling, call the police. Thank you. It's nice here. It's quiet. -She's not taking my son. I won't let her control him. The police will arrive, eventually. Did you tell them anything? Nothing. Rami... -I don't want to use this, but she won't take my son. Rami, she's his mother... She will castrate him, obliterate him! His life with her will be hell! It's his mother you're talking about. -A kid with his capabilities, he will suffer with her and I won't let him suffer! -Rami, please, this is not the solution. You love your son, you don't want to hurt him. Who's out there? -No one. -No one, my ass. Who came with you?! Show yourself or I'll shoot the doctor! I mean it! Anati, don't come in. -I'm serious! -Anati, stay out there. Who's Anati? Come in or I'll shoot the doctor! I swear! -No, Anati... Who is she? -My daughter. I showed you her photo, remember? Remember? I'm taking her with me and we're leaving. With the boy. We're leaving with the boy. -Don't move. Don't move! Rami, please, put away the gun. Bite me. What? -I said bite me. My Dad used to say it a lot, you must know what it means. Izzy, come here, we're leaving. -No one is going anywhere! Don't move. -Izzy, don't be afraid. I mean it, don't move! Rami, please... Don't "Rami, please" me! Now get outta here, both of you. I'm not joking! -Wait, what... Your gun! It's not loaded. I wasn't going to shoot... I'm sorry. She knew if she drove me crazy I'd do something stupid. Are you alright? -Now the police will charge me with kidnapping… they'll take my son from me. I'll die... I have an idea. Anati, forgive me. It'll never happen again. Shachar, how do you expect me to believe you? I can't talk right now. -Anat... Good evening, sorry to bother you. -Where is he? -Who? My son, where is he? -He's here. -Izzy? Dad, we have company. -Izzy! Come out here, sweetheart. Come. My sweet Izzy! Sari, I apologize for the mess, it was a misunderstanding... I took him on a tour in the city and... Stop lying. You kidnapped him. I swear I didn't. I tried calling, there was no signal, we stayed the night there, and today I came here for my scheduled session... Liar. He's lying to you, he kidnapped my son. This shrink is covering for him, Arrest him, lock him up. Izzy, look at me, tell the officer, Dad forced you to stay with him, right? Tell the officer. Izzy, honey, tell the truth. Don't be afraid. Dad hid you somewhere, didn't he? Are you Dr. Abadi? -One of them. Did you bring him here? No, he came on his own for a scheduled session. Why would I bring him? -You're lying. A session? He's lying! Then what are we doing in my study? Playing Scrabble? We're in the middle of a session. -You're lying! Both of you! Ask her. She won't lie. -Can you confirm this? Is your father covering up for them, or did they show up on their own for a session? Tell the truth. You have to. I asked you a simple question. A simple question... They showed up for a session. Okay, I suggest you resolve this between you. Good night. This is what's going to happen, neither of you will get full custody. Is that understood? Get used to the idea. The child belongs to the both of you. My father is prepared to continue counseling free of charge, and if you end up divorcing there are civilized ways, but if you can't work it out peacefully, then you're both unfit. My father can revise the report to recommend removing the child Sari... Sari, Sari. Sari, I just wanted... Dad, stay back, this is between us. You lying bitch. You're a hypocrite, you betrayed me. -I didn't. Every person in my life either betrayed me or let me down. I've had enough. Sari, I want to help you. Do you want to lose your son? You think you know best, huh? Sari, I know you're angry, but to think we're always right, is wrong. This isn't the solution. For every time you slap me, I'll slap you back. Is it worth it? We'll both hurt, and then what? Good night, honey. Sweet dreams. Good night, Izzy... So what do you want to do? Tea. What? I want to make tea. Want some? Pull over at the corner. -Sure. Are you leaving tomorrow? I don't know. When will you know? Look... What should I do? Dad, I can take a cab, I don't want you driving back. Hi, Mom. I was worried, don't be upset. Dad said you went back to the seminary, how did it go? Okay. They decided that I'm ‘different' and I said people who are different often make a difference. Sounds like a bumper sticker. -You see? You taught me how to sell. I hope that's not all I taught you. Mom, I wasn't criticizing you. Do you want to talk to Dad? -No, I still think he's a fool for going back, but foolishness has its charm. Tell him to call me if it gets nasty, I'm the better street fighter. Have a safe trip and... take care. Thanks. You take care too. Dad... If there's a wedding, will you come? -I promise. If there's a God, I'll drop dead first. Is this automatic or stick shift? Can't you tell? -Not really. What kind of car did you get your license with? -What license? Don't you have a license? Someday, God willing. Wait, hold on... You don't have a license? I'm kidding, Grandpa, I've been driving for years. Wiseass. Just like your father. Another hour of great music ahead, starting with a new song from Shachar Elkayam. "The Other Story". Grandpa, is the music bothering you? -Not yet. I can turn it off. -Whatever. So, you like it? -It's... ...tolerable. -Tolerable?
