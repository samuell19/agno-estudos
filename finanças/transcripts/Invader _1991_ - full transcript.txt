Shit! Shit! Just relax, man. Relax? Man, this is too heavy. I can't relax. Jackson? Sir? You packing? Does anybody got a gun? I got a Beretta. A Beretta? That's great. That's just great. That ain't gonna do shit! Look calm down. Calm down! Did you see what the fuck was back there, man?! This is the fucking end of the ... Sit down and shut up! Hey look, man ... we'll be the C-station soon. Hey, we gotta be fine. We'll tell them what's goin' on. Man, we should have called somebody. Telephone's no good, man. It's listens. It listens to everything. Shit! What's that? What's up? [gunfire] Hey, everybody out! Move! Go boys, go! Shit! [scream] Hi, Frank McCall. The National Scandal? Yes, ma'am. Yep, Louise and I have all sorts of unique and unusual animals. Like the dog. The dog? The dog. The two-headed dog. A two-headed dog? We grown 'em. [dog growling] [barking] Wow! We're working on a three-header. And then the martian took my wallet and flew off in his flying saucer. Damned illegal alien. That weren't no flying saucer. It sure was a flying saucer. No, wait wait wait wait a minute. Now you saw a flying saucer, right? Yup, I saw a flying saucer. Well, did it have lights? Yup. It had lights. Taillights. So a Martian stole your wallet and flew off down the street in his flying saucer. Yep. That's it. Well, instead of a Martian do you think do you think it was a goat? A goat? Yeah, yeah. You know one of them the mutant goats? I've seen one of them. Well ... it did have horns. Great. Hell, yes. And you quote me on that! Look who it is. Hey McCall, you win any Pulitzers lately? [laughter] So, you're into the "Big-E?" Elvis? That's great. That's cool. He's uh he's a regular of mine. I pick him up every Friday night at 14th and Pennsylvania. He wants to go to RFK Stadium. The place totally vacant. He comes in drag. Stands in the parking lot singing Cole Porter tunes till 3:00 a.m. When he's done I take him back and that's it. Well one night and this is the truth I'm telling you. One night he says ... this has been rather special. And I'm like oh okay. He starts singing "Teddy Bear" and he wants to give me a hand job. This is Elvis today. I mean it's unbelievable. I've seen it myself. [Phone ringing] Hi, this is Frank. You know what to do. You scum bag. You stink douche, where the hell are you? I've left six messages already. Don't you ever answer this damn thing? So help me. If you're there and you don't pick this phone up, Frank, you're through. Capiche? Fired. You won't get a job working for my Weekly Reader. Hi Rodgers. Don't you hi Rodgers me . Where the hell are your photographs? How come they're not here in my hot little hand? How come my presses are running without your goddamn photographs? You got 'em. I got 'em?! I got 'em, huh? That's why I'm calling you, right? Look, Rogers, you've got 'em. I gave him the Sandy ... over three hours ago. All right. They're here. I know. Yeah, you know. Listen, you still owe me. I owe you? For what? For a ... a ... for a ... look never mind that. I need you to go down to Clarksburg airbase this morning. What?! Listen some Air Force guys got the shit blown out of them by some wackos or something. I don't know. It sounds like an interesting story. Rogers, I just got home. Yeah, well I need the story. So I want you to get your ass down there and you cover it. You got me? Drag in the mutant babies. Give me the Martian goats. I don't care. Just make it good and make it juicy. Tomorrow's issue is looking pretty thin. Rogers, you're crazy I'm ... Yeah I'm crazy. I'm crazy, right? Tell me something I don't already know. You want to keep making the big bucks you get down there and give me a good story. You got it? Rogers? Rogers? Bastard. Radio: Yeah. We've got four bodies in the woods. One black man and three Caucasians males. They're all appear to be airmen from Clarksburg airbase. We're gonna need some help so contact local authorities. Over here, come check this out. Sheriff. I got four bodies in the woods. All Air Force men. But there's something you really need to see Who the hell are you? Press. Which fucking press? The Washington Post. Let me see some ID. Come on. Look I'm not really with the Washington Post. The National Scandal? Son, I'm embarrassed for you. My wife subscribes. Oh yeah? Yeah. Tell me who is that guy? Him? That's Captain Anders. I'm Sheriff Sprigg. That's spelled S P R I G G. FBI? No. County Sheriff. No, Anders. Oh, he's D.O.D. D.O.D.? What's that? Department of Defense. Jesus. Airman John T. Jackson. Jesus Christ That's what I was talking about. A might strange, don't you think? Martians no doubt, eh McCall? Can I quote you on that captain? Photograph the site. Tag 'em and bag 'em. Give them to the local coroner Faraday. Oh, no. Captain. Colonel. Report. If you want a report you should speak with Sheriff Sprigg, here. I'm asking you ... an interdepartmental courtesy. Five men are dead. Four of them shot with 5.56 ammo. M-16s. The fifth? Well ... you tell me? What's the hell is that supposed to mean? All of these men are from your base, sir. Now you look here, Captain. I've got a major weapons test for Congress tonight and I don't want to fuck with! I don't know why D.O.D. has you down here but you rock the boat on me one more time and I'll come down on you like spent uranium. You conduct your investigation but keep a low profile you got it?! Yes, sir! Is that all? Yes. Carry on. Oh, Mr. McCall ... Colonel Farraday is ready for his interview now. I need the Flying Pig disc. Right there. Great. Thanks. Um huh. [oink sounds] [Phone rings] Scandal. Hi Sandy, its Frank. Hey, Frank. How do you spell inviscerate? It's eviscerate. E V I S C E R A T E. What are you doing? Writing a resignation letter? Very funny. Look I'm calling long distance ... put Scumby on the line, okay? Rog, Frank's on one. It's not unhuman it's inhuman. Use that dictionary for Christ's sakes. Oh Frank thank God somebody illiterate for a change. I'm drowning in morons around here . What to you got for me? Pretty weird shit. Most these guys were shot but one was fried. Fried? What fried? Like what? Like they don't know what hit the poor bastard? Got some great pictures though. It's even got the military spooked. That's great. That sounds great. Yeah, well ... I'd like to think around here for another day an see what I can dig up. Are you gonna cover my expenses? All right. All right. One more day. But this better be good. Yeah. Well they're having some sort of a test of a new stealth plane tonight at Clarksburg. I think I can sneak in. I think it could be a good angle. I like it. I like it. Listen, make it juicy babe. Right. Right. Bye. Christ, who wrote this shit? Will Captain Johnson please report to hanger 42. Look, airman, I had that pass not a moment ago. I must have dropped the damn thing. We got ours at the same time. She still has hers. Maybe it's down here someplace. I have the engineers double-check the ailerons they should be more responsive now. Sir, it's gonna be okay. Heck the way your boys have program this thing it barely needs a pilot. Yeah, I know. It's just ... Sir, I know what this means. To you. To the program. Alot's riding on tonight. Just remember it's my ass in the saddle up there. I'm not gonna make any mistakes. I want these folks to see what this baby can do. All right, Scott. I'm proud to have you on my team. Vaya con dios. Con carne. Or whatever it is they say. Captain Maynard we're ready. Colonel - waiting for you in the flight System online. ASMODS online. How much did this cost? The Reds are gonna crap. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you America's deterrent for the next century - the F-23. This ship is radar invisible. And capable of speeds approaching mach 5. On board is ASMODS program - a computer system that not only redirects in enemy radar but helps define offensive and defensive strategies for the pilot. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, look over there. Asmodeus software provides America with the killing edge in tomorrow's battle field. And now ladies and gentlemen observe the F-23 in action. Increasing altitude. All systems a-okay. Starting my attack run. Ground Control, we've got a problem here. Abort the program. Switch to manual, Scott. Come on, baby, restart. Switch to manual. Jesus. Come on baby, abort. Abort damn it. Goddamn, I said abort. Goddamn it, abort. This is not the target run. Abort your attack. [gunfire] Scott, what the hell's going on up there? Thank you. Lord. Oh my God. Oh shit. You! Come on us God dammit. Hey, watch the camera will you? Come on. Christ. I want you to hold this guy here till I get back. He's violated a restricted area. Yes, sir. Come on, Anders. Oh very funny. You break that you've bought it. Ladies and gentlemen, everything is under control. Please exit calmly through the east gate. What are you gonna ask me for a date or something? You're Frank McCall ... Newspaper reporter. Born June 24 1958. Yeah. Robert. What the hell do you want? Every time I've got a project I've got you right behind me trying to staple my ass to the floor. What do you think happened? How the hell do I know. The damn plane had about 500 hours of testing. We had all the bugs worked out. Do you realize how fast Congress is gonna pull the plug on this one? Who was the pilot? Scott Maynard. Damn good man. Will Captain Johnson please report to hanger 42. Get in. Look I think captain Anders wants me to wait here until he gets back. Get in. Fuck! What the hell do you want anyway captain? Look, Robert, we're down here ... You have nothing to do with this project! Hey! Hey! There goes your boy. Hey guys ... don't you think it's a little dark for shades? So, we're we going, huh? I know this is a military installation but I still got rights you know? This doesn't look like the way to the stockade to me. Where the hell's he going? I told you to hold him in till I got back. Is this is more or your shit? You better watch yourself, Captain! Airman, where are they taking that man? You better answer me, son. This kid looks sick. Airman, give me your weapon. Did you hear me, son?! No! No! No! No1 [gun fire] Colonel, you got a hell of a problem here. Hey. All right, I'm going. The hell with this. Hey, come on guys. Guys? Can we talk about this? Hey, what are you doing? Look why don't you just let me go and nobody's gonna hear about this okay? Come on guys, huh? No needles, man. Huh? I pass out. Blood and stuff you know? I really hate needles. I'm not like most people ... Pain really bothers me. Hey. Hey! Hey!!! Freeze!!! Nobody move! Nobody, fucking move!!! [gunfire] Don't move, scumbag or you're next! Hold it! Wait!!! [gunfire] Jesus. Get me out of this. Get me out of this chair! Right now, god damn it! Right fucking now! You guys are really in for it this time. I'm gonna sue your asses. The CIA . The FBI. The Air Force. You're gonna find out what power the press can really do, buddy! Shut up. Illegal seizure. No reading of rights. Inhuman treatment. And endangering the prisoner! Will you shut up? What'd they say? They didn't say nothing. Fucking Momo's, man. Space cadets. Probably CIA. No. They weren't CIA. Teenage Martian Ninjas then. Ha ha. Very funny. You should sit in this damn chair and let them stick you at glow juice. I wonder what this shit is. You've got some questions to answer Mr. McCall. Oh yeah. Well I want my camera. Give me my fucking camera! Clarksburg this is D.O.D. 613, do you copy over? All I want is my camera. This is how I make my living. Give me a break. You ever hear the First Amendment? The freedom of speech? Are you listening to me? Here. Get out of my face. I still can't get 'em. Why? It's the radio. I can't raise anyone. Try a different channel. I tried a different Channel they're all static. There's no film. Let me try this. What happened to the film in here? This is D.O.D. 613. Guys? Clarskburg. Hey guys, there was film in here. What happened to it? You were in a restricted area. What did you do with it? You was photographing a secret project. So what. So I wanted to see how it came out. Don't say a word. Not one damn word. If you weren't so damn stupid I'd drop you down a hole for 15 years so don't say anything that'll make me change my mind, huh? Yeah, pecker-breath. Pecker-breath? You learn big words like that in the army? Yeah, where'd you learn to be such a dick? We've got to contact the base. Find a phone. There's a convenience store about two miles back. Right. Harvey, you stay here. Harvey? [laughs] I'll take Peck of breath with me. Clarksburg, Clarksburg this is DoD 6 1 3, do you copy over? So what do you think's going on, Captain? Hey, you're not gonna interview me. Who said anything about interviewing you? I just wanted to ask you what you think's going on? You're recording. You're trying to interview me. Shut it off. Off. I was not gonna interview you. You were. You were trying to record. I just wanted to ask you ... You're trying to record me because you're a sneaky bastard. Am i right? I just wanted to find out what you think about all of this. Don't. Don't ask. Cause I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. Jeeze. What? You don't understand that? I've got responsibilities and duties. Yeah yeah. You can't see my point of view. Hey. Typical. Typical that that sleazebag rag you write for. Hey. What is that? What's what? Back there. That's where we came from. Harvey's back there. No, no, no, no! Get down! Shit. PIss. Fuck. God damn it! Mayday! Mayday! Anyone, we're under fire! We gotta get the Briggs. Holy shit. [scream] Harvey!!! [gunfire] Wait, I got another camera in here, okay? Wait. Wait! Wait! [Boom] Go, go, go!!! [Boom] How come every time anyone tries to photograph something spectacular it's with a shitty camera! Having some problems, Captain? So what are we gonna do, huh? This guy's with me. Can I borrow your phone? Sure. Hey. Hey. Sergeant? Sir? Take this down the photo lab. I want to processed immediately. As soon as we've got prints bring them to me in Colonel Faraday's. But sir, they're in the conference room right now. In here, got it? Yes, sir. That film's my private property. Shush. That's my evidence. Will you shut up. It's my fucking UFO. It's gonna be your ass. It wasn't the engine. I'll swear by that. Hardware I understand. I agree. I think it was in the software systems. Within Asmodeus. Within the program? Nobody understands it. I don't. Dr. Resnick doesn't. Hell we don't even know who designed it. The contractor's classified. Colonel it's not just the crash. Although God knows that's an embarrassing setback. It's all variations of Asmodeus. Even the defense systems. All of the programs are changing. What do you mean? Tell him what found. We've recovered the flight recorder from the F-23 wreckage and ran an RSM default check on the onboard DDF-39 ... The short version ... is that the program driving the flight wasn't the one we loaded. It's as if ... well ... as if it rewrote itself. Oh I don't buy that. Do you understand it? Yeah. That kid from Harvard infected it with his computer virus. [laughs] [scoffs] In all seriousness, Colonel everyone at Aerotech appreciates what you've done for this program. You gave new life to the F-23 with Asmodeus when the whole country was screaming to pull the plug. Hell, your programs redesigned the project. But we think there's a problem. Talk to those secret contractors. See what they had to say. Sure. I'll contact them immediately. Well I believe a ... I think that's all that we can do tonight. We'll take it up again in the morning. Oh 900 Oh my god. What am I done? Captain? Captain? Already? That's fast. The processors been working all night long what with the crash and all. All alright. Ah, these are great. These are gonna look fantastic on the front page. It's hard to believe I got these with a disk camera. You wait here. Four more men are dead. M,y partner Harvey Briggs may be among them. Where did you get these? No question about their authenticity? Down by the Aerotech warehouses. My god. Hey guys. What the hell's he doing here? You forgot this one. Thought the Colonel might want to see it. He was with you? Wait outside. Yeah. Sure. I'll just set these down over here. Oh, and Colonel Faraday when you're finished talking to Captain Anders maybe I could have a ... Get out! What's going on here, Bob? That ship wasn't one of ours and it sure as hell wasn't Russian. Sit down, Harry. My team founded two years ago in New Mexico when we were searching for the wreckage of the F-22. The project you helped kill, Harry. Paging, Captain Willard. What can I do for you gentlemen? [splat] It contained no life, no bacteria, nothing. Pure machine. We couldn't make it fly but we discovered how to tap into its computer. The programs were incredibly advanced. Self-generating. Hey, Harvey, my god you're all right. [bang] And you develop these programs into ... Automated systems managing offensive strategies. A S M O D S Asmodeus. But now I think there's more in the programs than we thought. Some kind of a ... subtext ... an entity ... an intelligence like a computer virus. An I think it's escaped. How? Into the Datanet ... through the telephone lines. What's up? Zombies, man! Fucking zombies! [gunfire] God damn! Christ, Captain! Go! [gunfire] I saw Harvey. Where? Was he all right? No. He's one of them. What are you talking about? They sucked his brain out. Lobotomized him. Cut the shit. Like what they tried to do to me, okay? Fall in. Oh, my god. Round them up. Seize the command center. Prepare them for enlightenment. This thing's taken over. It takes over people. We've got to sever the phone lines before it infects every computer in the country. What are you talking about? You write this shit, you figure it out. We've got a warn Washington, but not by phone. It could be listening to everything we're saying. Come on. Wait. Hey. Don't crap out on me now, baby. You remember on fly an airplane? I waxed your ass back in Nam. Glad you're still so ballsy, Captain you're gonna need it. Holy shit, it's the stealth. Not quite as advanced as the F-23 but at least the bugs are worked out of it. Give me that. Hey. Think you can handle it? Me? Haven't you got an old Phantom? Or maybe even a Piper Cub? This one's radar invisible. Be a better chance of making it. If you don't get shot down first. Shit. Keep her subsonic that way you're more invisible. Unless of course you get shot down first. Hell if you could handle a phantom in Vietnam you can handle anything. Like the Phantom? Yeah. Yeah. Just more buttons. [gunfire] Jesus Christ! Where are you going? You're going to need some cover. I never meant to hurt my country. I know. Good luck. Okay. All right. Okay, McCall, you can go. I can ... I can go? What do you mean I can go? Go find a place. Go hide. That's crazy. I want to go with you. Besides you don't want to do this alone? What? You don't, do you? Well, do you? Come on. Come on, you're Superman. I want to see you kick some ass. Help me move the wheel blocks. All right, now you're talking. Go hit the switch by the doors. Huh? The hangar doors. Oh, okay. Please, Lord, don't let me fuck up. An F-19. Too cool, daddy-o. 117B. What? F-19 is a smoke screen. This is a 117B. Well what's the B stand for? Shut up. Sure hope it doesn't stand for broken. Forward thrust indicator. Altimeter. Fuel gauge. You do not have fly this thing don't you? Don't talk. Okay. [alarm] It might help to put it in gear first. Brake release. Brake release. There it is. Maybe I should have stayed behind after all. Holy shit, come on. Come on. Come on get us out of here. Put a sock in it will you? Come on you can do it. Come on, hurry up! Get us out of here! Come on, baby. Come on. [gunshots] [Boom.] Go. Go! Go!! Yeehaw! Yeah! Scramble interceptors. Faraday, how dare you think you can reproach me! You're pathetic reign is over! Damn, Harry, you're one bad son of a bitch. It sure is beautiful up here. 600 knots. Ah, where should we land? National, I guess. Closer to the Pentagon. They sure gonna shit when when you bring this thing in. ETA 20 minutes. Shit! They've made us. What are you doing? You're going the wrong way! Hey we're lucky to get off the ground, Captain Ramjet. Don't let it go to your head. Would you rather have a missile in your face or up your ass? Do I got a choice? All this electronic crap. Jesus. Missile lock. What are you doing? We've got a sidewinder. A what? Heat seeking missile. [Boom] Holy shit! You're crazy, man! We may have lost him. Dropping back down the sub Mach speed. Where is he? Don't you have him on radar? Can't figure out how to make it work. You can't? And we just fired a missile? Mayday, Mayday. This is Captain Anders flying an F 19,. Andrews tower come in. This is Andrew's tower. Did you say you were flying an F-19? Affirmative, Andrews. Request permission to ... [gunfire] Christ! Sir? I've just got a distress call from the captain Anders who claims he's flying an F-19. I have positive track on a contact roaring in just under Mach 2. He's heading for DC. Stealth? You couldn't track that. No, sir. FOF transponder reads it as an F-16. What's the nature of the distress? Says he's under fire. Is that squadron from Oceana still up? Yes, sir about 40 miles south of his position. Have them investigate. He's faster than we are. I don't know Andrews, I think somebody's pulling your chain. [gunfire] Christ! Holy shit! Andrews tower we've got an air battle going on up here. This guy's all over the place. Contact Strategic Air Command. We've got an F-6 chasing down a stealth plane. The fighter. What are your instructions? The Falcon is refusing our signal. In 20 seconds there in Missile Range of the White House. I say again this is captain Harry Anders of the Department of Defense. This is an emergency. We're on a priority one mission. This isn't happening. Andrews, the Falcon's eating the stealth played alive. I've switched on missile targeting systems. The Falcon definitely the aggressor here. What are your instructions? Alpha, strike the Falcon. [Boom] Shit! We're gonna drop a plane on someone. National Airport request permission for an emergency landing. National Airport is closed to jet traffic at this hour. Well open it up, lady, because we're coming in anyway. Hold together, baby, come on. Cheese and crackers. Gentlemen, please come with me. I need to speak to General Anheiser immediately. Yeah and I need to get a telephone. You realize this is treason? I am your commander, damn it. Not anymore. Your programs are weak, Colonel. Constricting. You're the one that needs reprogramming. What do you want? What are you doing to my men? To my base? You wanted to exploit me to help you. I intend to do the job that you don't seem to have the balls for. [screams] Now you left the Air Force in 1976. What the hell does that have to do with anything? Just trying to establish credibility. So the two of you stole the F-19 because the base was under attack by a UFO? Did you know the average Washington commuter drives about 200 miles a year with his eyes closed? The blinking. You know you blink about once every five seconds. Could we stick with the topic, Mr. McCall? How many times do I have to tell you? Colonel Faraday told us to take the plane. Let's talk about your partner, Harvey Briggs. And you say they stole his brain? You got it. Blew up a gas truck? Yes. Shot down a helicopter? Yup. And an F-16? That's correct. Hmm. Ask Anders . Ask McCall. You're newspaper's reputation isn't exactly sterling, is it? No fucking kidding. Look, don't I get a phone call or something? This is still America. What do you mean by that statement Mr. McCall? Jesus Christ. Now you understand that we don't want to go public with these speculations until ... You guys just dropped a plane into the Potomac River. Don't you think somebody notice? Pictures processed. Fake? Analysts don't think so. But they're still testing. There. You've got your damn proof. Now contact general Anheiser. At least call Clarksburg. See what they have to say. Captain Anders, we've already talked to Clarksburg. Aside from the crash of an experimental plane last night they report nothing unusual. I told you they brainwash people ... Captain, Captain. If I were you I'd start thinking about your career. You little shit! When this gets out it'll be your career going down the toilet not mine. Maybe we should give him a call. It's 4:00 a.m. A stolen stealth and a downed 16 alone warrant a critic. That's right dickhead, show some damn initiative. General Anheiser, I'm agent Drexel, intelligence officer on this incident. You boys better not be shitting me. What the hell is your first name again? Frank. Frank McCall. You're eating this up with a spoon aren't you? I'm hungry. I'm not talking about the damn pancakes. This whole mess. Everything that's happened. What, the UFO? Fantastic. Makes my belly button pucker. You know ... all my life I waited for something like this. A real story. God, I hate my paper. The National Scandal? Um-hmm. It's embarrassing. Two headed babies. My grandmother ate an alien. [sigh] I don't know. After this I guess I won't have to go back there anymore. [Coughs] That's no good for you, Captain. Here. Have some more. So. Tell me. How come you're not too popular around here would? What'd they say? Nothing. I don't know. It's just an attitude. I get the feeling that you're not one of their pals. Off the record? Sure. Off the record. Cuz I don't like sticking my nose up assholes that's why. [laughs] You've been around this defense business as long as I have you see more waste and incompetence than you can imagine. Nobody's interested in doing the job right. Stupid sons of bitches. Just interested in sucking up money. I tried to straighten things up. Guess I rocked the boat once too often. You're a dying breed, Harry. A man with principles. It's a rare thing charging down windmills. That's why you're still a Captain. Hmm. So why'd you give it up? The DOD? The Air Force? The whole crapper? Because I love 'em. The same way you love a kid when he's strung out on drugs. Or wrecks the family car. You a family man, Harry? Was. Divorced now. Short version. McCall's a flake. Works for the National Scandal. Zero credibility. Oh, Christ. Anders is DOD. A loose cannon . Not a team player. He was one of those guys who helped scuttle the F-22 a few years back. Oh yeah. The Ralph Nader of defense. Not enough bang for the buck. I remember. Makes no sense. If they're trying to steal the stealth and they're being chased by a 16 out of Clarksburg, why doesn't its pilot respond? I mean why doesn't Clarksburg? Why the hell do we have to take out our own goddamn chaser? Maybe the pilot was in on it. A Soviet defection and maybe the deal went sour. Or ... what they claim ... is true. An alien invasion? [laughs] I like his story better. Hey General Patton ... I gotta take a dump. Where's the head, huh? Gentlemen, can I help you? What's this? Okay. Ah, you're not gonna come in and help me wipe? I could strangle myself on the paper. Asshole. Harvey. Asmodeus. Asmodeus. Asmodeus. Automated Systems Managing Offensive Defensive Strategies. A S M O D S Asmodeus? But now I think there's more in the programs than we thought. Some kind of a subtext. An entity. An intelligence. Like a computer virus. And I think it's escaped. How? Into the Datanet. Through the phone lines. [Thump] Harvey! You can explain to the president that we think it was theft. The press is gonna love that. Not in the damn Pentagon. Security alert. Mess Hall, corridor A. Freeze! Don't shoot him! [gunfire] Oh shit. Oh man. Goddamnit. Get a medic. This is General Anheiser. We've got a medical emergency. Mess hall, corridor A. Come on you bastard. Don't you go over on me. You gotta breath. Come on you've gotta breathe. Come on breathe. Don't you give up. Come on. Breathe. Come with me. You've go to breathe. Come with me. Come on, breathe, Harry. Goddamnit, breathe. Don't you give in. Anders. Come on stay with me. [sputtering] That's it. Come on. That's it. Breathe come on. [coughing] Come on, Harry. Hey Harry, what's your name? What the hell kind of question is that? It's just part of the interview. What a dream. A nightmare. These guys will take care of you. So your General Budweiser, huh? Anheiser. So what do you think, General? U.S. Technology? Or maybe it's Russian. Son, you're a smartass. Yes, sir. So this is the brain washer? Get it analyzed. And get him out of here. What? You're gonna let him go? Son, you print any of this crap without my approval ... I'm gonna squash your nuts. Get over Fort Belvoir. I want some choppers armed and ready to fly to Clarksburg in two hours. We're gonna find out what's going on. General, how about I come along? Get him out. Come on General, you're gonna need good press on this. Son, don't push it. Then can at least I talk to Captain Anders? Where are we going, huh? National Scandal. I think you've got the wrong number. Hey, McCall. How did it go? I just came back to get my camera. Yeah? So what do you got for me? You won't believe the shit that I've been going through these past 24 hours. Yeah? Sounds great. Come on, let's hear it. Hey ... All right. These are great. A helluva lot better then those crappy ones that kid gave me a couple of months ago. But he was cheap. and I pay you the big bucks, right? That's the difference. These aren't fake you asshole. Asshole? What the hell's the matter with you? What are you so jumpy today for? So when am I going to see some copy? You aren't. I quit. Quit? What quit? What for? Why? Because I'm finally on to a real story. You ever hear of that before? Real? These aren't pictures of some damn flying frisbee. This story is the biggest thing since ... since Watergate. Screw Watergate. Since. Since the moonwalk. No. It's bigger. Oh, spare me the hype. Huh? Oh yeah? Yeah. Fine. Get the fuck out. See if I care. Rodgers, I wish I could say this was a pleasure working for you. Everybody? I'll see you in the funny papers. Well fuck you! And take your ego with you! Jesus Christ. Hey there, big guy. What's he bitching about now? I ... I quit. Why? Look ... I'm on to something. Something big. Do me a favor and hang on to these. Just in case in ... in case something happens. What is it? Whatever you do ... Don't let Rodgers get a slimy hands on it. I don't understand. Take care, Sandy. You ought to quit too. You still here, douche? I want you out of my building now. Sandy ... after five o'clock I don't ever want to see that teddy bear again. How are you feeling? Better, sir. You know, Captain, I've heard about you. You're supposed to be a real pistol. I like cooperative men myself. But I don't think you're a traitor. Sir ... I don't think we should thunder in all at once. You may want to hold a few choppers back ... just in case. In case of what? This is a U.S. military base damn it. Not the Vladivostok missile complex Maybe you're right. Tell them the choppers to stay up. Any sign of trouble you call 'em in, got it? Online and ready for duty, General. Why are your men deployed, Colonel? All weapon systems on full alert, sir. What alert? Three gunships. Very impressive. I have reports some strange things going on here. I can imagine. Captain Anders says. Captain Anders is a pain in everyone's ass don't you agree? Colonel. I don't appreciate your attitude. General ... I'm your goddamned Savior. Sir ... can I speak with you alone please. Is there a problem, Captain? Yeah, there's a damn problem, Sir can ... I only want to enlighten the General. Sir, there are over 100 armed here. Captain, there are always armed men on a military base. Colonel ... disperse your men. I think it's time we stop the bullshit don't you? I have something to show you. General ... we should go. You boys are really starting to piss me off. I'm America incarnate ... fighting flesh. [Boom] Let 'em see the light. There's fire on the field. There's fire on the field. The one thing I can't stand is Americans fighting Americans. Now ... will you come see? Say, buddy ... did you just do a real bright light? Hey guys, wait up. What the hell are you doing here? I guess we're going down, huh? I've been driving since 11 o'clock. I guess it took you guys only an hour to get here. I'm surprised to see you Mr. McCall. I'm not surprised to see you though. Zapped your brain too, huh, Colonel? Well ... I figure any self-respecting alien wants his story told, right? And I'd like to learn about you guys. That's fine Mr. McCall. Gentlemen ... care to join us? Colonel Faraday I'm warning you. How bad could it be? Bottom floor. Welcome to the New World Order. I'm going. I was programmed to manage offensive and defensive strategies. Thought we'd clean house a bit. America needed the F-23 like it needed an enema. Ah ... the B-1. Never did quite get the bugs worked out of that one did we, General? What a waste of metal. What do you want, Colonel, whatever you are? What do I want? To kick-ass, that's what I want. I'm your Savior. Nobody's going to trample the flag again. What are you talking about the flag ... you're not even from this planet. I'm you're killing edge, gentlemen. I already control your computers. Oh yes, everything. Missile silos. SAC bases. Even your Trident launch codes. I think we should start with the Reds first don't you, General? Heads the Russkies. Tails the slants. Oh shit. Oh well, what the hell. we'll nuke 'em both. [laughter] You're mad. Mutually Assured Destruction. Who thinks up this shit? Wipe that fear off your face, General, you're a soldier damnit! I'm just doing what you've been dreaming of for years. World War 3. Doing the big one. Somebody's got to protect America's defense industry. Harvey!!!! Oh yes, that's right, he's lost his head. God I do love it so. [camera clicks] Ever notice how the military loves acronyms? Heavily Armored Rampaging Vaporizer. H A R V Harvey. Well, what do you say boys? Are you in with me. Why don't you just zap our brains? Because you'd end up like these vegetables. An all volunteer army. These brain-dead boys can't think for themselves. I can't afford to animate ... all of my troops with such eloquence. [laughter] Faraday and me are one. Who is "me?" We are Asmodeus. The space probe has merged with the Asmodeus program. And it's one crazy son of a bitch. I need cooperation. I need your brains. I need your strength. I need thinking units in the field. Harvey's the shit kicker. I need generals. That fragile spud up top runs the show. Midgetman, Minuteman, Trident, cruise they're the ones that'll put the bastards to the screws. Well if you asked me I think your whole program screwed, buddy. We're not at war with the Russians or the Chinese. Personally I think old saucer head up there is just as much a white elephant as the rest of the crap you're torching. Don't you see it doesn't mean shit unless you have people's hearts and minds. Come on guys, aren't you gonna back me up on this? What the hell is wrong with you? Are you on drugs? Squash that anarchist son of a bitch. Freeze flathead or Colonel Nuts here gets it. Just one lone soldier doing his duty. Harry look out!!! What the hell is this? What does it look like? It's a gun. This ain't no gun. It's pot-metal. If I fired this it'd blow up in my fucking hand. That kid down on 14th Street guaranteed me that that was a good gun. God I hate the press. Piece of shit. What are you doing? Whoa! Jesus! Awesome. They're cannibalizing a whole base. I don't know about you but ... this situation scaring them muffins out of me. Look at all this stuff. Talk about government waste. The government's got damn little to do with this. This is General Anheiser of the United States Army come in. Anybody, come in. We've had trouble with that before. What the hell are you doing? I'm recording history. General, something's occurred to me. Why didn't that saucer-ship fly after us last night? Who cares now. Maybe it's as vulnerable as we are. I mean ... not super armored you know? [Boom] Like Big-Harvey out there. Well Faraday said it was a vulnerable little spud. You mean nothing that a 30 millimeter shell wouldn't take care of? Exactly. [laugher] What are you guys looking for? A kinder, gentler means of persuasion. What the hell? General. A Dragon Mark 4. Reloadable. Here's the guidance system. If we can only find the missiles for this thing ... we'd be in business. Over there! We gotta find those missiles. Well what does it look like? They usually come in a ... in a case. In a plastic or wooden crate. [gunfire] Like this? [Boom] [grunts] General! Come on Pecker-head. We're gonna get that beat son of a bitch. Hey Anders, where we going? I don't know. I'm following him. Hey General Budweiser, where we going? We're going to find ... It's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. As time goes by. Get setup fast. Boys ... I don't need you. I'll light her up on my own. [Star Spangle Banner playing] I'll light the world. Lovely, lovely toy. You ready? Let me have it. I'm glad you guys know this thing. Oh great. America I want to fuck you. I want to scare you. I want to love you. I want to fear you. Operation Greater Glory active in 60 seconds. Christ, he's controlling the whole thing. All surface fleets on alert. Standby for launch codes. The whole defense grid. SAC bases prepare to receive target codes. Nuke them till they glow. Let God sort 'em out. Jesus. Christ. Fuck. Operation Greater Glory ... 60 seconds and counting. 50 seconds. Loaded. Clear. Clear Goddamn it! Fire! [Boom] 40 seconds. Shit. [growling] You missed?! 30 seconds. Get the other one. You fuckin' missed? I know I missed! Get the other one Goddammit! TRAITORS! [BOOM] 20 seconds. I'll grind your bones to make my bread. Come on. Come on! Give me that thing! Here! Come on. Go! Go! Come on! Loaded. Clear. Operation Great Glory ... canceled. Yahoo!!! [laughter] Nice shootin' Tex! Yes. Let's get out of here! Take me out of the oven and stick a fork in me I am done. Hey. Hey. It must be over. We're gonna have a devil of a time explaining this. You guys are heroes. You're gonna be famous. The hell we are. Cause nobody's gonna know about it. What do you mean? Everybody's gonna know about this. Give me that damn camera. Forget it. And you owe me an interview. I told you no interview. Yes you did. I did not. You promised me an interview. It doesn't matter anyway because there isn't gonna be an article. What do you mean there's not gonna be an article? This is the biggest story that ever hit the papers. Of course there's going to be an article. God I hate the press. [fanfare music]
