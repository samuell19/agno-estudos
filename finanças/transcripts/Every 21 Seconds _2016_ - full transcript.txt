(light music) (bright operatic music) - [Brian] It's the last thing you think of until it becomes the only thing you think of. It can happen to anyone, at any moment. (gentle music) - I tell Jim and Katie no running in the house, and then you come flying in here like a bat outta hell. - They're not even up yet. Come here, take off these clothes. - Oh, are you doing laundry? - I'll do whatever you want me to do. (Mary Beth laughing) (Katie and Jim laughing) - Oh, darn. If you had only run a little faster this morning. - Oh. I'll keep that in mind next time. - So, which of your buddies from Alcoholics not-so-Anonymous are going up to Wisconsin with you? - Oh, the usual suspects. Kevin, Joe, Henry. We're just going up there to finish up the deck. It's not like we're gonna be boozing the whole weekend. - Mmhmm. - Besides, you know that I'm a two beer guy. - Yeah, because anything after that, and I could have my clothes off and-- - How dare you? - Daddy! - Oh! (Brian growling playfully) Love you guys. I'm gonna take a shower. Fantastic, I'm gonna get this over to production right away and your ETA will be 28 days. No, no, thank you. All right, bye-bye. - [Thomas] Brian, can you please check on the status of these three orders please? - Yes, sir, I can. All right, these two went out yesterday. - Fantastic. - And this one actually went out this morning. - Great. - And this one I just collected the deposit on. - Wow. - Uh huh. - Is that a new account? - Uh huh. - Nice. - You bet your bippy. So, um, oh wait, I'm sorry, do you, do you smell something? What is that? I think I smell a bonus. - Yeah, we'll talk. - I'm gonna be looking for it. (bowling ball rumbling) (Kevin laughing) - [Kevin] Hey, don't be afraid to actually hit the pins, Henry, huh? - Wow. We've been playing for years, you'd think you would have actually gotten better by now. - Ah, you'll get it next time, you'll get it next time. - Don't lie to him, Brian. (guys laughing) - [Henry] Hey, shots! - Oh yeah! - Here you go. - Here's your drinks. - Thank you, Jen. - Thank you, Jen. - Ooh, Brian, you sure know how to score. - Um, yeah, thanks. You know who really knows how to score? Joey. Scored post season tickets like it was nothing. Real man of action. - One of the perks of being top salesman of the year. (chuckling) - I cannot believe in a million years that I'm actually excited to go back to Cleveland, huh? - No kidding. Thanks, Jen. - Yeah. - All right, to, uh, Cleveland. - Yeah! - Woo-hoo, just gotta rock. - Mmm, sweet nectar of the gods. - Get me a little something for Joey. (guys laughing) - Jenny is so far out of his league, they're not even playing the same sport. Come on Bri, you're up. - All right, all right, let's do it. (upbeat rock music) Oh! (pins clattering) Yes! - Oh, you're kidding me! - Fuck, Bri! At least make it look like you're trying, man. - Language, brother, you know I don't like that. - Sorry, I forgot how good of a Catholic you are. Or maybe, you know, it's because you had such a massive crush on Sister Alice, huh? You know, you used to curse like a sailor until she came along. Though, she was pretty hot. - Shh! - Who, Jenny? I know, right? So hot. Well, you can lay off Kev, I got her number. - [Guys] Oh! (insects chirping) - What? - Mary Beth, did you do something different with the mashed potatoes? - I did, I added some fresh dill. Do you like it? - It's different. - How's Joe's car coming along? Did you guys find the problem? - Ah, we gotta switch out the muffler first, but I'm sure it'll be okay. - It's a big job. - Nah, you know I like that kind of stuff. (armpit farting) - Jim, at the table, really? - That was grandpa, not me! - Oh, that wasn't me. At least, I don't think that was me. - Looks like we might have to switch out grandpa's muffler too. (kids and grandpa laughing) Nice chicken, mmm. - Thanks, babe. - Any chance there'll be room for me in that car tomorrow? - Yeah, right. You're not going up there. I don't even like it when he goes up there. I got a bad feeling about this, Brian. - Mom, you say the same thing every time. And every time, I come home in one piece just fine. Oh, I love you, ma. - [Mrs. Sweeney] I love you, too. (gentle music) - [Mr. Sweeney] Good night. - Have a nice night. - Good night! (Brian sighing) - The kids are finally... Asleep. - You like what you see? - Yes I do. Yes I do. - Good, 'cause then you can remember this when those trashy local girls try to get your attention this weekend. (Brian growling playfully) (both moaning) - [Katie] Mommy? - [Brian] Don't worry about it, she'll be fine. - [Katie] Mommy! (Mary Beth sighing) - I should go check on her. - No, let me. It's probably just the monsters. - You are such a good daddy. Now go get rid of that monster quick, then come back here, okay? - [Brian] Mmm, yes, ma'am. What's wrong, Snugglehead? - I think the monsters came back, and they're under my bed. I can smell them. - Really, you can smell them, hmm? Well, I thought I got rid of them last time, but I better double-check for sure, okay? All right, hello? Anybody underneath here? Any of you sneaky monsters? - Oh, maybe that's what I'm smelling. - Mmhmm. - Sorry, daddy. - Why, Katie? - Sorry, daddy. - Why didn't you tell me that old stinky hotdogs keep monsters away? - That actually works? - [Brian] Oh, that totally works. - Put it back! (Brian chuckling) - Katie, this is why you're not allowed to eat in your room. This is kinda gross because I don't even remember the last time we had hot dogs. How about this? Next time, why don't you try being brave? - [Katie] Brave? - Oh yeah, being brave is the very best way to keep monsters from coming back. Think you can do that? Bravery Bear, meet Katie. Katie, this is Bravery Bear. - That's Bubbles. - Well, he's been promoted. So, anytime you get scared, it's Bravery Bear's job to make you feel safe. So you just give him a big squeeze. Think you can do that? - Okay. - All right. I love you, honey. You get some sleep. Monsters vanquished.

Well, you can take this with ya! - [Joe] I rode with him in the ambulance. The cops drove Henry and Kevin to the cabin. The nurse said he'll be fine. That he has a hangover and just needs to sleep it off. - Thanks for calling and letting me know. I'm on my way, so I'll see you in a couple hours. - [Joe] Sorry again, we may have overdid it last night. - Shocker. Jim, Katie, go get dressed. You're going to the sitter's. (phone ringing and buzzing) Hello? (dramatic music) Yes, this is Mrs. Sweeney. What? - Brian has been stabilized and transferred to the intensive care unit. - I don't understand. How is this even possible? First I'm told that my husband has a severe hangover, and now you're telling me he has a severe brain injury? - Mrs. Sweeney, I apologize for the initial misdiagnosis upon his arrival. On the surface, it appeared to be a hangover. When there were no signs of improvement this morning, we began a round of testing. The CAT scan came back and revealed substantial brain swelling. That bar keeps us pretty busy and we thought he was another-- - Okay, whatever. What does this mean? - What it means is that if the swelling does not go down, we have to perform surgery. Look, Mrs. Sweeney, what I'm gonna tell you will not be easy. - Wait, wait. What? You are not saying that-- - Please, there's a strong possibility he may not make it. - No. No, you're wrong. - Please understand-- - No, you're fucking wrong! - I know this is-- - No! I want to see my husband right now! - I will get someone for you. Nurse Lisa to 1012, please. - Oh my God, Brian! - The bruising got much worse overnight. He didn't look like this when he was-- - Are the restraints really necessary? - A lot of times, patients with these injuries, when they wake up, they become combative. - Can I be alone with him, please? - Oh, of course. If you need me, I'll be right outside. - Hey... Oh my God, what did they do to you? Bri? Stay with me, okay? Can you hear me? Stay with me. We're gonna get you home, okay? (Mary Beth crying and sniffling) (dramatic music) - Mrs. Sweeney, if Brian recovers-- - When. - When Brian recovers, there's still no way of knowing to what degree, and patients with this-- - He's going to be fine. - There's a measurement called the Glasgow Coma Scale. Brian's current ranking is a three. - That's not bad, right? I mean, how many numbers are there? - The scale is from three to 15. Mrs. Sweeney, we're not equipped to handle the severity of his injuries. There's a specialist in Green Bay that we would like to transfer him to-- - No, no. Here. This is where I want my husband transferred to. He's one of the best neurosurgeons in the country. He's in Chicago, close to our home, and that is where I want him. I believe that's actually closer than Green Bay, right? - Yes, that's correct. Dr. Synkowski's a brilliant physician. I can see that you've done your research. - Yes, I have. I did some right after you told me my husband was misdiagnosed. - Oh my God! - Hey. - [Mrs. Sweeney] Oh my God! (dramatic music) - Joe, tell me what the fuck happened. - We didn't do a thing. One minute, we're leaving, and the next, we look back, and Brian's sprawled on the ground. - Where the hell are Kevin and Henry? Do they know something? - No, no, they're back at the cabin sleeping it off. They have no idea how bad this is. We were told he just had a bad hangover. - Let's go. - Steve-- - Steve! (sighing) - You ready? - Yeah. (rock music) - Hey, what can I get ya? - Can you tell me what happened here last night? - Always a good time, friend. - Can you be more specific? - From what I understand, a couple of big shots rolled in here from Chicago, throwin' money around, which we like, and uh, shootin' their mouths off, which we don't like. - Is that right? - And one of them shot it off a little too much, and he had to be rolled right out. Which is what he deserved. - That big shot happens to be my brother! Now cut the shit, old man, use your fuckin' head, and be more specific! - Whoa, I'm sorry. Uh, I thought you were lawyers. I didn't know you were crazy. I don't know what happened. I wasn't even here. I only know what I know from drunk folks, so, I can't help you. - What the hell, Steve, you're a cop! You know you can't pull a gun out like that! - [Steve] Just get in the car. - Where we going now? - Police station. - What, to turn ourselves in? - No, to see what they know. (dramatic music) - [Dr. Synkowski] Uh, Excuse me, Mrs. Sweeney? - Yes? - I'm Dr. Synkowski. How are you holding up? - [Mary Beth] Uh, I'm okay, I guess. - [Dr. Synkowski] I understand. Look, I'm gonna spare you the statistics for the time being. - I appreciate that, and please, you can call me Mary Beth. - Okay, Mary Beth. Um, I'm sure at this point, you're very well-versed on how serious the situation is. - Yes, very much so, but he's not a statistic, and he's not going to be one either. - Okay, I can't guarantee success, but I can guarantee that I will do everything in my power to help your husband. - I already like you more than the other doctor. - Well, you should, I'm quite good, as is my staff. You know, for starters, we know the difference between hangovers and traumatic brain injuries. Okay, look, stay as strong as your husband, Mary Beth. We might just walk out of this okay. - I hope so. (dice rattling) - [Marilyn] All right. - This game is so much fun. - This game sucks. - Oh, come on, you're the one who picked it out, buddy. And besides, there's still time left. You can come back and slay. - I like to play with my dad. He plays it differently, more fun. - Well, how does he do it? - Different. Just wait 'til dad gets back. - Daddy's not coming back. - Don't say that! - Yeah, Katie, don't, don't say that. Jim's right. - But it's true. That's why mommy cries. - Dad will be back! - Hey, guys, listen, you don't, don't have to worry about it, okay? He'll, he'll be back. (dramatic music) Hey, Bri? Can you hear me? I um... I just wanted to tell you that I love you. You know, that-that we all love you. Please wake up. (Marilyn sniffling and crying) I'm gonna need you to stay with me, you understand? You made me promise that you would look after me, and that job is not done yet, okay? Jim and Katie, they need you. Mary Beth needs you. We all need you, Brian. - Hey, Elaine, it's Mary Beth. I'm okay. Um, is Henry there? I've called a couple times... Okay, well, I just think it would help if maybe the guys would just, you know, stop by or something. I mean, he's in Chicago now, so the drive won't be so far. - I'll let him know. - Okay, yeah, um... Please tell him that I called. - Sure. I'm so sorry, Mary Beth. - Thanks, Elaine. - Henry, you really should go see him. - I know. I just feel so guilty. We-we should have done something. (dramatic music) (heart monitor beeping) - I knew something would happen. His mother said the same thing. I shouldn't have let him leave. - It's not your fault. - That piece of shit. Sue him to the fuckin' moon, Mary Beth. Sue him and that shitty hospital that thought he was taking a siesta. - Okay, we'll look into it, Joe. There are bigger issues right now. I'm focusing on Brian getting through this. - That guy deserves to be behind bars. - [Joe] Or worse. - I'm good with that too. - Stop it, both of you. (Mary Beth sighing) Hey... - Excuse me. - Doc, is he getting better? - Actually, he's regressing. Um, when he is awake, he doesn't say that much, and quickly goes back out. Seems like his only good moments are when his family and friends are here. - What is she doing? - Well, the nurses do a routine sternum rub. It's just to stimulate some sort of a reaction. - [Brian] What are you doing? - Um, like that. - Hey, hey Brian. Hey, Brian. - You pussy motherfucker... - Why is he talking like that? He never uses that kind of language. - He has no idea what he's saying. Basically, imagine if you took all of his thoughts, put 'em in a blender, and then just poured them out. - Shut up douchebag, please. (Brian mumbling) - Okay, but I-I mean, that's, that's still good, right? - Uh, yeah, we'll take it. (siren wailing) - I know you're focused on Brian right now, and as well you should be, but... We need to talk about Ricky Stubbs. - What about him? - He has to pay for what he did. - Steve, I can't do this right now. - Look, that piece of shit didn't even get arrested that night. I mean, the police talked to a few people, even though everyone knew what happened, nobody actually saw it go down. - Please, Steve-- - They know that Stubbs did this! They know it! What are we gonna do? (scoffs) - Steve, I, my husband is dying in the hospital. I have two kids at home, confused as all hell about their daddy. I can't worry about that asshole right now, I can't! All I care about is Brian getting through this. That is it. Okay? So, you do what you feel you have to do. But I know what I have to do. (somber music) (Brian screaming) I should have been there. - Okay, you are here more than I am, and I get paid to be here. - He was probably so scared to be alone. - Well, I suspect he was in too much pain to feel fear. Look, Brian has had a bleed into his spinal column, and this has caused an injury to the nerve root, which in turn has caused severe back pain. And now, here's the controversial part. I recommend removing part of the left front temporal lobe in order to relieve some of the pressure. This will also aid in preventing any additional damage to the rest of the brain. - Oh! - Mom! - I think we need to set up this procedure as soon as possible. As a matter of fact, I would like to schedule the surgery for tomorrow morning. - If there is any more talk about cutting out a piece of my husband's brain, I will take him out of here into another facility, Dr. Synkowski. - I understand your trepidation, but the fact that Brian has slipped back into a deep coma more than two weeks after the initial injury suggests that we will not have a good prognosis. Mary Beth, your husband has suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. Excessive compression of an area such as the brain stem, which is responsible for regulating consciousness and breathing can lead to extreme disabilities. Or death. - So then what, if you do it? He turns into "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", or something? - Doctor, I think what my mom is trying to find out is, what kind of person is Brian going to be if he gets this surgery? - Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to that. - So we're just rolling the dice then? I mean, I get that he's in a coma right now and our options are limited, but Jesus Christ, I mean-- - Doc, are you saying this will save his life? - [Dr. Synkowski] There's no guarantees. I'm saying that I feel this is his best option. - And if he was your family, your son, is this the decision that you would make? - Without hesitation. (dramatic music) Okay, I'll prepare the paperwork. - Brian has received his sacraments, and now the rest is in God's hands. Have faith. - Thank you, Father. Don't forget Bri, you promised. - [Mr. Sweeney] Miss, could you give us a minute? - Absolutely. - Hey. You're not going anywhere. So you might as well wake up. Please Bri, please wake up. I need you. I need you baby, please... (Brian clearing throat) Bri? Brian? - Oh, Brian! - Oh sweetie! - Oh my God! (all chattering) - Mary? - Yes, baby. - Oh, the doctor! - Brian, it's Dr. Synkowski. How are you feeling? - I've been better. - I think we can postpone the surgery. - Oh my God! (all chattering) (rock music) - [Jenny] Here you go, boys. - Thanks, hun. - Somebody die? You guys look depressed as hell. - Brian. Brian had an accident, he's... Not in good shape. - Oh my God, what happened? Is he gonna be okay? - He'll be fine. We're just a little pissed that he got hurt. Thanks for the drinks. - Sure. These are on the house. - [Henry] Thanks, Jen. - We should have been there. We gotta go see him, he probably feels-- - I just can't right now, man. I can't fuckin' stand to see him like that, and I don't even know if I can look Mary Beth in the eye right now. - It's not about you, man. It's not about us. I feel guilty as hell too, but he can't feel like we're turning out back on him! He's our friend! I don't understand, why wouldn't you want to go see him? - Don't tell me how to feel, Kevin! - All right, that's enough, fellas. Just calm down. - As with other TBI survivors, Brian's recovery is dependent on how quickly we can start working with him. - Okay, what do I do? - Well, being as for the past two weeks, he's been able to stay awake during the day, and the fact that we no longer consider him a candidate for surgery-- (Mary Beth chuckling) I think we can start the rehabilitation process. It is vital to his recovery. - Whatever it takes. (dramatic music) - Brian? You okay? - Fine. - [Dwayne] What's this? - A bird. - Good, one more, and then we're gonna start from the top, all right? - Okay. - Just get off me! I don't belong here! What are these people? I don't belong here! Get the fuck away from me! Dude, get the fuck away from me! - Amber, go get security. - I'm not like these people! I don't belong, back up! - [Dwayne] Hey, It's cool man. - It's not cool, it's not fucking cool! I don't belong here! I wanna go home, I wanna go home! I don't belong here, goddamn it! I wanna go home... What do you mean, what do you mean start talking? Where's my pudding? Come on, bitch! - Brian! Brian, stop! What-what's happening? - What the fuck? - He is all yours. - I will smash you-- - How come he's acting like this? - He became violent in the rehab center, and is demanding to leave, okay? He is not cooperating at all. You have to take your husband home. - What am, what am I supposed to do with him? Brian, stop. (Brian sobbing) - [Brian] Take me home, Mare. I don't belong here. - Okay, okay. (dramatic music) Wait. You wanna sit down? Good night, Bri. (Brian grumbling softly) (birds chirping) Yes, once a week. That's all I can work right now. I've explained this all in the paperwork a couple of weeks ago when my husband was kicked out of rehab. He needs my full attention right now. Okay, thank you. Bye. Katie, I can give you more of your own if you're hungry. Please don't touch your father's. Honey, you have to eat. - No, I need to go to the hardware store. - Okay, I'll drive you, Brian. What do we need from the hardware store? - Mm-mmm. I need more pop, but I can drive myself. - [Mary Beth] No. - Brian, you'll be driving soon enough, but it's just, it's too soon now, okay? - I can drive just fine. - [Mary Beth] You haven't eaten since you've been home. Please. - I'm thirsty. I need to go to the hardware store. - They sell pop at the hardware store? - Yeah. - Okay, but you can't live on pop, Bri. You need to eat. - Look Bri, you gotta eat, okay? You love cheeseburgers, right? - Come on, I want more Coke! Hardware store! - Okay, hey. Look at me, okay? If you eat that burger, I'll take you for a ride, and we'll get more pop or wherever you wanna go. - I don't want to go to the store. I want to play a game. - That's fine, I can, I can stay and watch them. - Thank you. All right, do you see anything? Honey, we have enough pop to last us a while, okay? Let's try and find something to eat that looks good to you. We have enough, Bri! Come on, you need food! We need to find something you'll eat, stop! - [Brian] What do you want me to eat, Mare? - [Mary Beth] Anything! - Pick something, or you want me to pick it? Great, what, dip? Need some dip. Here we go, chips. Oh, more chips. - Mister, you need to calm yourself down before I do it for you. - Let's just do it. You gonna calm me down, motherfucker? Calm me down. Calm me down! There, there! Eat up, pussy! - Brian! - [Brian] Eat 'em! - I am so sorry. I am so sorry, please let me explain, I'm so sorry. (Brian groaning) (sighing) (muted television conversation) (dramatic music) (loud rock music) (loud television conversation) - Brian! Brian! Brian! ¶ I'm rolling down into dreamland ¶ - Why are you blasting the music? Brian? Hey, are you okay? - Where are my power tools? - I'm not sure, Bri. Packed away somewhere. You need to take a shower, it'll make you feel better. - I want to build us a new deck. - Okay. That'd be nice, uh... Hey listen, so someone is coming over for a visit. We gotta get you in the shower. (Mary Beth clapping) - Great. - There are a couple of reasons for my visit today. Not only did I want to come by and say hello and see how you were doing, but I wanted to give you this. - Do you like to jog? Are you fast? I'm really fast. Do you want to go jogging? - Uh, yeah, I like to jog, I suppose. Not sure how fast I am nowadays-- - I'm really fast. We-we can go right now. - A-anyway, this is a call log from all your clients. Does he remember work at all? - I'm uh, I'm right here, you can ask me. - I'm sorry pal, just after your accident, the clients called in, some daily, to check in on you and see how you were doing. And that's a call log from all of them. - That's great, that's so kind of everyone. Please extend our gratitude from us if they call again. - Also, your coworkers took it upon themselves to put together a little collection for you, after they heard what happened. - I'm-I'm ready to go back to work again. - Mary Beth, as you know, Brian has a lot of friends at the office. And you know, we just want you to know that you've been in our minds this whole time. - Oh my gosh. Once again, please, thank everyone for us. This is beyond gracious. This means so much to us. - We just want you to know that your family doesn't ever have to worry, 'cause it seems that Brian qualifies for permanent disability. - Oh, uh, well, thank you, but don't you think it's a little too soon to make that call? I mean, I'd like to wait and see how his rehabilitation goes. - Well, if Brian accepts the permanent disability offer, then he can take all the time he needs. He doesn't have to go back to work right away. He shouldn't even have to think about it. - I'm right here! God, quit treating me like I'm a child! I can walk, I can drive, I can do everything I did before! I want to go back to work! Douchebag! I can work! - Bri, Bri, he won't let you come back. You're not well enough yet. I'm gonna find you someplace good to rehab, okay? I promise, we'll just start there and see what-- - No, I'm not fucking back there! (glass shattering) I'm not, goddamn it! - Hey, stop it right now! Stop! Don't fucking do that! (dramatic music) I'm sorry, I just don't know where else to go. He needs help. We need help. - Mary Beth, you have to understand that Brian's actions are symptomatic of the damage that was sustained to the injury to the left front temporal lobe. Uh, well, his short term memory and cognitive ability will be compromised as well. Most likely, Brian, he won't remember some of the things he does, even minutes after he's done it. There's a chance he will not recognize people, or even understand who they are in his life. - Well, he started having these outbursts of anger that I've never seen before. I mean, we have kids. - I know. Well, it's a concern. I can only tell you that this is going to be a challenging time for your family. Look, I want you to call this number when you get home. By the time you call, I will have spoken with them, and they will tell you when to bring Brian in to start the rehabilitation process. - [Mary Beth] But nobody will take him. - Call that number when you get home. (sighing) - Dr. Synkowski I... I don't have the words. You are just the best, thank you. - Those words are fine, and accurate. - Have a good day. - You too, Mary Beth. I'll see you soon. (doorbell ringing) - Hey man, your total is $14.50. (change rattling) - Yeah, oh, sorry man. Thanks, keep it. Hey, Brian? (upbeat rock music) Eat up, bud. Extra sausage. I know how much you like extra sausage. - No I don't. Hey, so uh, Henry and uh... The other one. - Kevin. - Yeah, yeah, I thought, I thought they were coming? - Bri, they feel really bad about what happened. - They-they shouldn't. I mean... You know what? We should all go bowling together. - A little soon for that, no? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I mean, this looks a lot worse than it is. I'm, uh, I'm almost fully recovered. - Fair enough. - Yeah, yeah. - [Joe] Don't worry about that, buddy. Those bottles are tricky. (car horn honking) - [Brian] Hey. - [Mary Beth] Hey. - [Joe] You win the lotto or something? - Sort of. (Joe laughing) Brian, you're going to the best rehab facility in the state. - That's great news! - Yes! I mean, paying for it will be a different story, but what matters is Brian will finally get the help he needs. - I'm not going there. - You have to go to rehab, Brian. You have to get better. - I'm fine. I'm good. - Hey, you're not fine. You're still in pain, honey, and your outbursts are becoming more frequent. Hey, this is a good thing, okay? - I'm not going. I'm fine! ¶ You better watch out, you better not make me late ¶ ¶ I say hey, hey, hey ¶ - Later, Brian. I'll set up the whole bowling thing, no worries. - Sounds good. I'll be there. ¶ Sweet home Chicago ¶ - Mmm. - Did you enjoy having Joe over? - Mmm. - Yeah? - Mare? - Yeah, Brian? - Am I doing better than I was yesterday? - [Mary Beth] Yes, yes you are. - [Brian] Hmm. - [Mary Beth] So, we're starting your therapy in a couple of days, Bri. Are you excited? - I don't need therapy! I'm not like those people. How many fucking times do I have to say it? - I think we should give them a try, Brian. I think they can help. - No, they can't. That place is for crazy people. Fuck! - Brian, you're going! Okay? You have to get better, Dr. Syn-- - Goddamn it! (tense music) - Brian, no, Brian... (Mary Beth breathing shakily) - Oh my God... (Mary Beth crying) (dramatic music) - Running away? - Going to rehab. I can't hurt you, Mare. I can't hurt the kids. I don't know who this person is. I just want to be myself again. I'm so, so sorry. I didn't think I was capable of hurting you. I didn't think I needed rehab, but obviously I do, if I could just turn into a monster like that. My mind, it's so... I'm just so confused. I-I-I don't get it, I-I just, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. (Brian crying) - [Mary Beth] You didn't mean to do that. They're gonna help you, Bri. I know they will. - I love you, I love you so much. - Don't worry about finishing. Let's focus on starting and seeing how far we can get, okay? - Okay. - How is this supposed to make me feel better? - Jon, we've been through this. This will strengthen your arms and get your coordination back on track. - My arms and coordination are fine! - Okay, keep doing the work and show me. - Asshole. - Excuse me? - Not you. Well, you too. (Brian groaning) - Who's crying over there? I didn't know this was a nursery. I thought it was rehab. - Go to hell. - Jon, go resume your work. - Ashley, men are talking, go clean something. (Brian grunting) What happened to you? - None of your business. - [Jon] Oh, he doesn't like me, Ashley. - Oh, it's hard to imagine why. - No, it's not. He's a prick. - Well, finish that step and do something about it. - Now, that's not appropriate. - At least I'm not grunting over here like a porn star giving me a woody. - You call that a woody? I feel sorry for your girlfriend. - What'd you just say to me? (Brian grunting) - Good, great job Brian. (clapping) Whoo! You're awesome, all right. Way to go, how do you feel? - Hi, Brian. How was rehab today? - Fine. - Good. That's a cool medal. - Yeah, my sister gave it to me. - That's sweet. Can I see it? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Uh... - So, when this timer goes off, ask me for your medal back, and I will give it to you. Okay? - Ask for it back? - Mmhmm. This goes off, ask for it back. - Okay, then what? Coloring blocks? - Your brain was injured, and we have to rehab it. And that comes in the form of reading, writing, memorization exercises, focus tasks, and critical thinking. (puzzle pieces clattering) - So we, we are talking about color, coloring books? I mean, this is, this is kid stuff. These are toys. - Well then, show me you don't need them. Red nine. - I know what a red nine is, doc. - Very good, Brian. Quite good. Very good. (timer beeping) Do you need something from me, Brian? - Um, mm-mmm. - No? Okay. - Oh, thank you. - [Dr. Jacobs] You're welcome. - Mom, can we go to the toy store later? - We'll see how daddy's feeling a little later. Okay, sweetie? - Yeah, I wanna go to the toy store too. - We're going home. - Yes, we're going home. - Home! (Brian pounding furiously) - Okay, everyone relax. - Daddy! - Hey, everyone relax, relax. You can't do that Brian, do you hear me? Bri! Do you hear me? You can't ever do that! Close the door! (Katie breathing heavily) It's okay, it's okay. Close the door. Close the door, it's okay. It's okay. (dramatic music) (water running) Bri? Hey, what did I say about running in the house? - If we did it again, you'd ship us off to Indian-Asia. (Mary Beth chuckling) - Indonesia. Do you know what they do to kids there? Nobody does. Whoa! (kids laughing) Where's your father? - Outside. - What? What's he doing outside? - He's in the car. - What? (suspenseful music) Brian? Whatcha doin'? - I was hoping maybe the driving thing would come back. Maybe even that I never lost it. - I'm sorry, honey. Do you want me to drive you around for a little bit? - Mare? - Yeah, Brian? - Am I doing better than I was yesterday? - Yes, Brian, yes you are. (Brian grunting) - Hey, yeah, you're flyin' today, Brian. Nice job. - Yeah. - It's only been a couple of months, and you're puttin' in the work, you're seeing the results. Great, great job. Hey uh, how are you sleeping? - Fine. - How many hours do you get? - Uh, I dunno. - Can you keep track for me? - Okay. - I've been through too much to deal with this shit! All of you motherf-- - Stop! Stop it. We're here to get better. - They're just making sure we don't get worse, moron! - No. They're here to help us get back to how we were before. - Things will never be how they were before, you dumb shit. There's no going back. This is who we are now. - Hey, you can get better, Brian. - Yeah. You can improve the same way waking up in the morning improves your chances of plowing Kate Upton later that afternoon. - Okay, who is that? She sounds familiar. - Seriously? Man, your eggs must have really got scrambled. Everybody knows who Kate Upton is. - Blonde, she has big boo... Blue eyes, the blue eyes. She's in a lot of movies, guys love her. I don't really see it, but, okay, you know, I totally see it. - Oh, oh, oh! - Yeah. - Ah. - Oh, okay, yeah, she's hot. - Yes, she's very pretty, yes. - So, when the timer goes off-- (timer beeping) Ask me for your medal back, okay? - Okay. - We're very excited about your progression, Brian. You're working very hard. - It's all for my family. - What about you? - Without them, nothing else matters. - You love them, don't you? - I do. I choked my wife. - You did? - That's why I'm here. That's why I'm busting my ass. That's why I'm gonna continue to bust my ass, until I get better, 'cause that's what they deserve. - Fair enough. (timer beeping) - Can I have, uh... - [Dr. Jacobs] What? - Can I have... - What do you need from me, Brian? - Pop, a pop. I'm thirsty. - Sure. - He didn't even want to come up here this afternoon. - Brian? - Bri, we drove all the way up here to speak with Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Hill. Can you please just listen to them? They're gonna ask you a few questions. - Brian, I uh, I do understand that this is something you probably don't want to talk about, okay? Now, being that you weren't at the pre-trial, you don't know that Mr. Stubbs was charged with felony assault with the intent to do bodily harm, due to his attack against you. - Look, Brian, your testimony can literally be the difference on whether or not he's convicted for what he did to you. - Brian, it seems that you and your family have suffered quite a bit due to Mr. Stubbs' actions that evening. Now, we can make sure that he pays for that. It's a felony charge. - Not only that, but you can move forward on a civic case for additional damages. - I'm not gonna testify. I don't even want to attend. I just want to focus on getting my life back together. That's it. - Like I told you on the phone, he didn't want to go to the pre-trial, he didn't want to come up here today, and unfortunately, he doesn't want to go to the trial. - Mr. Sweeney, we're banking on you as our star witness. It's imperative that you attend the trial. - I don't remember much. - That may be enough right there. - It's not enough, it... - Are you okay, Brian? - He gets headaches frequently. - [Leslie] Did he get those before this happened? - No. Nor did he have the memory loss, or the violent outbursts. - Violent outbursts? - Yes, very violent. And very intense. He goes from zero to nuclear in a matter of seconds, and usually without warning. The doctor told us that this was actually common for someone with Brian's type of injury, but before this happened, he, he rarely lost his temper. - All the more reason to go after this guy, there's no-- - We, uh, understand. Look, we'll keep him on the witness list just in case he changes his mind, okay? I hope you feel better, Brian. - Thank you, Mr. Sweeney. - [Ashley] Keep working. - Look somewhere else, Sally. - It looks like a little girl trying to play with a bowling ball. - Focus, Jon. - You're really sweating. Too heavy? Need a hand over there? - Keep talking, funny man. - Hey Ash, uh, should we step in there? - No, they talk crap to each other all the time. I think it's good for them, the whole competition thing. - Did mommy forget to pack you a bag? Huh? - Looks like you wanna go huh? - Oh jeez! - Damn it! - [Ashley] Hey, hey, stop that's enough! (trainers shouting) - Don't move! - Whoo! Yeah baby! - Let's go, let's go! - Come on! - Brian! - Hey, hey, down, down, down. - [Ashley] Hey, stop. - Unacceptable. You could have hurt yourselves, or worse, one of the other patients. Mr. Sweeney, you've already been kicked out of a rehab facility for being violent, right? - Nice. - Oh, you think this is funny? - You should be happy. We showed a lot of stamina and strength in there. - True. Couldn't do that a month ago. - It's a testament to the quality of this facility. I understand if you want us to be in a promotional video, and we accept your offer. If the price is right, of course. - And I'm gonna need my own trailer. - Two trailers for him. The second one's for his massive balls. Attacking a Marine? - A Marine? You look more like a hippie. Besides, you did kind of throw a medicine ball at me, so there's that. - All good points. - Enough, Abbott and Costello. Look, if this happens again, I'll be forced to remove you guys from-- - You asked if I skipped lunch earlier in there. I did, I'm starving. You? - I could eat. - We done here drill sergeant? - Yes. You both are free to get the hell out of my office. (people chattering quietly) (soft jazz music) - I didn't hurt you earlier, did I? - Don't flatter yourself, Sally. All right. (Jon chuckling) Maybe a little bit, but it's all good, no worries. It's part of the reason I gave you so much shit this week. - The only reason? - Because you can do this. I can see it in your eyes, but you-- (fork clattering) - [Brian] It's, it's, it's fine, it's fine. - But you whine, and crumble, and you're better than that. Things are different for us now. Mood swings, forgetfulness, strength coming and going, shot balance, all that stuff. The only thing we can do to get ahead of it is if we, if we work our asses off. - Will we ever be ourselves again? - We'll always be us. We'll just be a new us. - I kinda liked the old me. - Too bad. You think I wanted an IED bomb to explode in my face, kill my brothers and sisters in some desert shithole? - IED bomb? Wow, I had no idea. - So, what happened? - I don't know. I don't wanna tell you. - [Jon] Why not? - It's, uh, it's embarrassing. We think I was sucker punched outside of a bar. - We think? Well, there's some cowardly people out there. Got you and me both. Don't be ashamed of what happened to you. Wear it with pride. (birds chirping) - You hungry, Bri? - Mmm. Therapy is draining. (Mary Beth chuckling) - I heard you made a friend. - Hmm, Jon. Got nailed by a car bomb. Now he's got the PTSD. - Is he nice? - Mmm, he's sort of a dic... Tator. Um, always bossing people around. - Feeling better, daddy? - A little bit, Karen. - Why did you just call me that? (Mary Beth sighing) - So, how long did the jagoff that did that to you get? Seven? I'm guessing seven. - Nothing yet. The court proceedings are taking forever. - That animal is still out there walking around? - I guess so. - How's Mary Beth feel about that? - She's mad at me. - Mad at you? You're the one who got sucker punched. - Yeah, she's mad at me because I won't testify. - You won't testify? Why the hell not? - They're gonna ask me about that night. - [Jon] So the fuck what? - I don't remember. - You have to at least go, man. He can't get away with it, Brian. - I'll look like an idiot. - Well, all the therapy in the world ain't gonna help that. - So I thought that movie was pretty good. I mean, the story wasn't great but the acting was, it was good. What was that actress's name? - Which one? Kate Upton. - Uh huh. She was, she was pretty good. - Mmhmm. So um, don't we have to go get the kids from the sitter's? - I'll go grab 'em later. I thought that it would be nice to have a little alone time. - [Brian] I love you. - I love you too. (Brian's family talking and laughing quietly) - [All] Surprise! (all talking excitedly) - I love you, daddy! - I... - Honey, what's wrong? - I didn't see it coming. - Hey, that's how surprise parties work. - I should have saw it coming. - No, no, no, no, no, don't get mad at yourself. Everybody can be surprised by a surprise party because nobody thinks their family is gonna sink to such a level to do it. You know what I mean? - That's true. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - I gotta tell you, the day they wheeled you out, I knew you were a fighter. I knew you were gonna make it, and I knew that you would see a day like this. - Thanks, doc. And thank you for coming, that was really cool. Can I, can I ask you a question? I have this thing on the crown of my head. I'm scared to death to touch it. - And you just don't want to touch the top of your head? - [Brian] No. - Well, my first thought would be don't touch the top of your head, okay? Listen to me. I'm sure everything's fine, but the injury was only a few months ago, okay? So it is common to have weird little things happen. That being said, let's schedule an appointment, we'll take a look at it. - Daddy! - Hey, honey. - Play a song for us! - Oh, not right now, Snugglehead. I think everyone is-- - Come on, dad! You're awesome on that guitar! Everybody loves it! - Sure. - Come on, dad! - Yeah. - Maybe a quick one. Thanks, Jim. - You're welcome. - Okay. - Everyone be quiet, my daddy's gonna play a song. (guitar strings strumming) - I haven't picked one of these up in a while. I'm sure it's like riding a bike, right? (guitar strings strumming discordantly) (gentle acoustic guitar music) (all talking loudly) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Come here. - You're so beautiful. (Brian shuddering) Maybe next time. - I'm sorry if I rushed you, it just seemed like you've been doing so much better. It's okay. - [Steve] What's up, bro? - [Brian] Hey. Thank you. - I talked with Leslie Clarkson today. Remember her? - Nope. - She's the prosecutor. - Okay. - You need to meet with her. - No, I don't. - Brian... Ricky Stubbs made you like this. - I don't care about that stuff right now, Steve. - You act like that doesn't even matter. Okay, he needs to be in a cell somewhere. - Great, so what good is that gonna do me, putting his ass in jail? Is it gonna help me remember what I ate for dinner last night? Is it gonna help me do anything? I don't care about that shit right now. All I care about is getting better. - He's a piece of shit, Brian. He needs to get what he deserves, okay? And Clarkson is gonna do that, but she needs your help. - Steve, I don't care. - Man, you are not thinking straight right now. Okay, that's, that's why we're here, trying to help you. - I'm not that bad. I'm better than I was yesterday. - You are, bro. Look, mom and dad, I mean, they're gonna try to baby you through all this, but I'm not going to. I'm your brother, I'm the only one who knows what a thick head you have. I'm just trying to look out for you, man. (rock music) - [Henry] Hey, Brian! - Oh, good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Hey Bri, it's so great to see you, man. - [Brian] Yeah, you too buddy. - [Joe] That's for sure. - Hey, Brian! - Oh, hi! - How are you? - Great, almost 100%. - That is so great. Hey, Joe. - Jen. Okay, that's great, we better go get our shoes. - Okay. - Well, if there's anything you need, you just let me know. - Okay, thanks. - Did you see that? - Joe, I'm not looking, this isn't high school. - It's starting to get uncomfortable. You can tell she's undressing me with her eyes. - Who? - Jen. She needs to get over it. I'm just not into her. I got all these other babes. (Joe chuckling) - Yeah. You're up. (Brian shouting) - Oh, shit! Motherfucker! No, get off me! Fucking floor is wet! What kind of fucking joint is this? Clean your floors! 'Cause someone can get hurt. (dramatic music) - Hey man, we were all a little off tonight. You still did better than Henry. (tense music) (Ricky speaking muffled) (Brian gasping) (Brian mumbling) - [Mary Beth] Are you okay, what's wrong? Are you okay? - [Brian] I'm okay. - [Mary Beth] Just go to sleep, okay? - Yeah, as it turns out, I'm actually not so good at the whole shopping thing. - Well, exactly, and this will help. - Ah, mmm. Mmm, mmm. Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm. - Mmhmm. You know, I don't think they sell go fuck yourself at the supermarket, Brian. - Well, maybe they should. - Hmm. You forgot charcoal. - Gas grill. - And food. - That's, no, I... Damn it! - It's a start. - What do you mean it's a start? It's been several months. I mean... Just, I want to get better, I want to at least feel normal. - Okay, it's like losing weight. Nobody notices their weight loss as it happens, day by day, right? But as the months go by and the clothes don't fit as well, and-and people find the need to poke holes in their belts, all right, but when they see pictures of their old selves, they realize how tremendous their journey was. - Hmm. Okay, fine. (timer beeping) Medal, please. (gentle music) - Okay. - Would you like to talk to me about what's bothering you? Okay... I can't do this anymore, Bri. I feel like I've been demoted. Like I hardly matter to you anymore. The kids and I are walking on eggshells around you so you don't just fire off. I'm sick of feeling invisible to you, and feeling like less of a woman because of that. I have poured all of my energy into helping you get better. But what about me? I have needs too. I feel like I'm only half still in this marriage. It's not fair. Maybe you don't have any feelings for me anymore. Maybe you do. I wouldn't know. But I know I still do. I still love you. - I know. I see how you look at me when I walk through the door, desperately hoping to recognize the man that you married. And the kids... Hoping they'll see the father that they used to play with. I know how much you've sacrificed. I love you, Mare. I can feel it. I just don't know how to love. (dramatic music) (Mary Beth moaning) (Mary Beth chuckling) - Good morning, lover. - Good morning, good lover. Mmm. (both moaning) Hey, Mare? - [Mary Beth] Yeah, Bri? - Am I doing better than I was yesterday? - Um... Yes, Bri, yes you are, Brian, so much better. Hey! Thanks. - You should have some of that, it's really good. - I'm trying. - Morning, rugrats! - [Jim] Morning dad! - You look good, dad! - Oh, thank you Katie, I feel great. All right, see you guys later. Bye, lover. - Bye. (gentle music) - I ain't takin' any deals. Why you all even offering me a deal anyways? You ain't got a witness, which means you ain't got a case. You all ain't got shit. - [Miranda] Okay, Ricky, that's enough. You want us to do our job, then be quiet and let us do it, or you're out of this room. - Ricky, we got this. - The last thing I need on my record is another felony, not to mention five years of probation. - Although out of line, my client does present an interesting point, Leslie. You don't have any witnesses, do you? Trey, anything? - We have a case, Miranda. Don't kid yourself. We just want to save the family more trouble than they have to go through. - Yeah, and uh, just to be clear, this is a one-time deal. It expires once you leave this room. - What, is that supposed to scare us? Come on Leslie, we're not novices. Look, either drop the charges, or we'll see you in court, and we both know that you don't want that. (Mary Beth sighing) - Mom, why can't we go too? - Yeah, grandpa lets me help him drive. I'll drive all the way to 'Sconsin. (Mary Beth laughing) - I'll tell you what, maybe grandpa will let you help him drive to the sitter's, okay? Get your stuff, it's almost time to go. - Oh, hey Bri. Did you, uh, have a change of heart? - Nope. - Ms. Clarkson said she would keep you on the witness list in case you-- - Mare, I'm not going. I'm not. - Bri, for some reason, you don't give a damn, okay, but we do. We care about you, and we want to see you get justice for what this degenerate did to you. I mean, he ruined your life, Brian! - For fuck's sake, Steve, we've been through this. - What? - Brian-- - No, dad, please. I told you, I don't care about Ricky Stubbs, and I don't care what happens to Ricky Stubbs. - Well, maybe you should! - Don't tell me what the fuck I should care about, Steve! Don't! I barely remember anything from that night. Shit, I barely remember anything from yesterday. Do you have any idea what that's like? Waking up every morning, spending hours desperately just trying to remember what you did the day before, conversations you had, who you had 'em with. All I do is pray and work and do everything I can to just find one little shred, one little shred of the man I used to be. You think I care about justice? There is no fucking justice. - Brian-- - He's right. He's right. Leave him alone. We need to respect his wishes. (dramatic music) - Hey, Snugglehead. Look, I'm really sorry I got upset downstairs. Just, your Uncle Steve can be pretty frustrating sometimes. - It's okay. Here. Maybe you can hang out with him. - [Mary Beth] Katie, honey, we have to go. - Thank you, Katie. I love you, honey. - I love you too. (Jon humming softly) (car horn honking) ¶ And to keep our honor clean ¶ ¶ We are proud to claim the title ¶ ¶ Of United States Marine ¶ - I was hoping you had other plans today. Who pissed in your grits? - I don't even eat grits. Just drive. - You're missing out, grits are great. (Mary Beth sighing) - I see your coward of a husband didn't even show up. (Jerry chuckling) - [Jerry] He probably didn't want to get his ass beat again. (Mick and Jerry laughing) - No, stop, stop, stop. The only coward is the one sitting right there. - [Bailiff] All rise. - You should have gone up there. - Fuck, man, you too? We've been through this. I don't remember enough. - That's bullshit. - I wish it was. - I'm not saying you should lie, but at least go up there and spit in the guy's mouth or something. (Brian sighing) - Jon, I just wanna move on. I might be able to go back to work soon. - Yeah, a nine to five sounds great. - What's your fuckin' problem? - [Jon] The only problem I have is I don't have a medicine ball to throw at your face right now. - I don't need that shit today, Jon. That's not why I came here. - Why'd you come here? - To get better. - Yeah, yeah. You wanna move on and get better. The fastest way to move on is to see that justice is done. It's good for you, it's good for your soul. - Like I said, if I could, I would. - Unacceptable. - Goddamn it, why don't you just worry about your own fuckin' problems? - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, run away, Sally. You're great at that. Take this with you. (dramatic music) - [Ricky] Well, you can take this with ya! - Get your car keys. - No, I'm busy getting better. - Get your keys.

(Jon shouting happily) ¶ And everybody needs a chance once in a while ¶ ¶ Everybody wants to be ¶ - Dr. Winston, if a person were to suffer from damages such as subdural brain hemorrhage, lacerations to the brain, significant damage to the left frontal lobe, as well as bleeding into the spinal column, what sort of possible side effects could one expect from such injuries? - Objection, your honor. This line of questioning has nothing to do with this trial. - Your honor, on the contrary, Mr. Sweeney sustained such injuries due to Mr. Ricky Stubbs' actions on the night in question. Now in order for the court to understand the full scope of Mr. Stubbs' actions, it's important that they know the repercussions of damages suffered by Mr. Sweeney as a direct result. - Overruled. Dr. Winston, please answer the question. - Thank you, your honor. If a person were to come in with the injuries that you described, they would be diagnosed with a severe traumatic brain injury otherwise known as a TBI. In short, they would have issues with executive disfunction and stroke-like symptoms. In layman's terms, what that means is they would have problems with focusing, concentration, memory, mood stability, as well as muscle weakness. Survivors can also have problems with seizures, hydrocephalus, or be in a coma. - Now, you said survivors. Does that mean that person suffering from such injuries could possibly face death? - Absolutely, as well as permanent disability. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - Dr. Flemming, in your professional experience and after reviewing all the material presented to you by the state, can you say with certainty what caused Mr. Sweeney's injuries? - No. No, after reviewing the MRI, I cannot say with any degree of certainty what or whom might have caused the injury to Mr. Sweeney's left frontal and temporal lobes. - Well, is it possible that his injuries are the result of being intoxicated and simply losing his balance and falling? - Certainly. Falling head-first onto any hard surface such as concrete, or even the corner of a table could lead to this type of injury. (upbeat music) - Your honor, the prosecution has failed to provide a single, actual witness. We appreciate the testimony of Mr. Sweeney's family and friends, as well as the expert testimony of these esteemed physicians albeit in a hypothetical manner, as none of this proves that my client did this. At this time, we'd like to request that this case be dismissed, and all charges dropped immediately. I mean, unless the prosecution is able to produce a single witness that actually witnessed this alleged assault by my client. - [Judge Collins] Does the prosecution have any witnesses they wish to call? (dramatic music) - What the hell? - What is it? (all talking excitedly) - Order! Order in the court! (gavel pounding) Order! - Your honor, the state would like to call Mr. Brian Sweeney to the stand. He has always been on our witness list, which was of course provided to Mr. Stubbs' defense team. - Okay Mr. Sweeney, please take the stand. - Oh, come on! (men shouting) (Brian's family clapping) - Order! Order, order! (gavel pounding) Order in this courtroom! - Raise your right hand, left hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - Mr. Sweeney, can you recall the events of the night in question? - I was a different man before this happened. (soft music) You might get what you deserve today. You might not. I really don't give a damn. You've taken enough from me and my family. That all ends today when I walk out of this courtroom. All I care about... Is being the man that my family and my friends deserve. That's it. - Thank you, Brian. That'll be all, your honor. (Ricky crying) - We have no questions for Mr. Sweeney, your honor. - [Judge Collins] That will be all, Mr. Sweeney. Thank you. (Brian's family cheering and clapping) (gavel pounding) Order! - [Steve] Brian!
