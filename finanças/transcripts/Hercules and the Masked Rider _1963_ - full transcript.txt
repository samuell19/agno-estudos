[MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSES APPROACHING] [SHOUTING] [SCREAMING] [SOLDIERS YELLING] -Stop it! You mustn't mistreat my quary that way. Better than deer hunting, Captain Blasco. These rascals, here, are slower, but they're smarter. Let's go! [SHOUTING] [SCREAMING] -One more effort, Father. We're almost to the border. -I can't go any further. All my strength is gone. Run, while there's still time. -No, I won't leave you, I won't leave you, Father. -Felipe, she's your wife now. Take her to safety. Run quickly. Run, run. Quickly. -No! -Uh! Ahh! -He's dead. One less to worry about. SOLDIER: Keep moving! Get along, to the wagon! Move on! Hurry it up! Move on, I say. -Hurry, Dolores. The border is close. [LAUGHING] Dolores! Felipe! Having been married this morning at daybreak, a voyage for the honeymoon is in order, wouldn't you say? -But if they reach the other bank of the river, they'll be in the territory of the Prince of Valverdi, and out of your power forever, Don Ramiro. -We'll catch them, Captain Blasco, this or that side of the river. [LAUGHING] -Stop! Stop where you are! -After them, you lazy idiots. Capture the woman and you can have her. Hie! -The prince. -Don Francisco! -Oh, please, Don Francisco, save us. We're on your land now. -You don't have to worry. No one will touch you. -Don Francisco, I regret having crossed the line between our lands. But I request that you return these fugitives. -What crime have they committed to be pursued so ferociously? -The man is a farmer, who's running away from the service of the king. -The king doesn't force them. You sell them off for 100 gold ducats a head. You have depopulated your farmland to sell them to their deaths in Flanders. And the earth, without hands, will not give bread. -When their dying of hunger, I'll know where to send them. -Huh! Your ominous threats do not touch me, Duke. I have no mercenary troops or captains of fortune at my service. But don't suppose you may may abuse me, never. -Don Francisco, you are wise, but times have changed. And now we govern with force. Lay hold on those two. -Duke Now you are going too far. [HORSE APPROACHING] -Dona Blanca, after your stay in the convent at San Paula, you have returned more beautiful than ever. -If my cousin Don could be here, he would make you a repent all your arrogant behavior. -I'm grateful to Felipe and Dolores, who gave me occasion to see your daughter once again, prince. The two runaways are a gift for you, Dona Blanca. -But why? -A most negligible homage from an admirer. I wish you would wear a more precious one. A gift worthy of your loveliness. -Duke, order your men to return to your boundary. -Don Francisco, I think before long our lands will no longer need boundaries to divide them. [LAUGHING] -And the fat man? -I kill him, ha, ha. -And the Flemish officers? -Kill them, ha, ha. -And all the others don't worry about it? [LAUGHING] -In fact, without me, I don't know how they can continue the war in Flanders. [LAUGHING] -Hurry, Cavantita, or the hero will catch a cold. [LAUGHING] -Ah, ha! Fortunate are the men who marry you girls. After many days of traveling, you've made a new man of me. -Don Juan, it is we who are grateful that you have honored us with your presence. -Oh, we would be so happy if we belonged to the lands owned by your uncle, Don Francisco. The Duke Ramiro makes our lives impossible. -Oh, remember, don't tell a soul of my exploits in the war. It's a military secret. [LAUGHING] -Adios! Adios! -Adios! -Adios! -Adios! [CHURCH BELL RINGING] -My men are peasants and few. And more adapted to times of peace than to making war. And I and the mercenaries of the Duke of Medina could destroy them completely in a few days. And I want to no bloodshed. I don't want the people of my land to suffer the consequences of an invasion. Blanca, God only knows how much I love you. And how gladly I would give my life if this would put an end to the danger of war. I have struggled to see that my people's lives might be peaceful, secure. And now-- -Don't worry anymore, Father. You can say to Duke Ramiro that I accept his gifts of betrothal. -My child, is there already someone in your heart? Tell me. -No one, Father. Please forgive me if I leave you alone. -[SIGH] No, Felipe. Not here. -And where then, if we can never be together. Are we or aren't we married. -Uh, yes, but-- oh, Dona Blanca. Quickly, go now. -Then when are we going to act married? -Soon! -Why? Why? -You're in love with your cousin, aren't you? [GUN SHOT] SOLDIER: Hurray for Don Juan! -Juan! SOLDIER: Call out the guard. -He's here! They're announcing his return. [TRUMPETS BLOWING] -Dolores, Juan doesn't have to know yet. I want nothing to mar the pleasure of his return. Help me, now. The rose water. And-- and a touch of powder. I don't want him to notice. [BELLS RINGING] -Welcome back, Juan, to the land which will one day be yours. Esteban, open the granary and the cellars to the people. Today, will be a fiesta for the return of my beloved nephew. I know Blanca will be happy to see you and welcome you back. Come! -Let's begin preparations for the fiesta. -Blanca, I've dreamed of this instant for a whole year. -The war has not changed you or your gallantry, cousin Juan. -No, but my long absence seems to have made a change in you. -A year is long time, cousin. One can change a lot in a year. --[SIGH] And now you wish I had never returned, right? -Juan, we are truly filled with joy at your return. -Not true, Don Francisco. There are some who can put warmth and enthusiasm only in letters. What's happened? I want to know. DON FRANCISCO: Blanca is to marry the Duke Don Ramiro. -Is that true? The vows you've made, your promises, what's happened? What's made you change? -She wanted to satisfy my wish to preserve peace. Her wedding will spare us a war with Don Ramiro. -Better a war than this sacrifice. Don Francisco, tomorrow my soldiers will be back from the campaign in Flanders. Let's arm the people and make a surprise attack on the Duke. All his people loathe him. -I have given my word that as long as I live I will sacrifice anything to prevent the shedding of blood. -And who are you? -Felipe. I'm to serve as your personal valet. -You're new around here, aren't you? -I belong to the line of Duke Ramiro, until she and I made off for good. -Who's she? -Dolores, I'm married, in name, but not in fact. -What kind of a story is this? -Only the truth, senor. Not that I like it. Dolores has the honor to serve Dona Blanca, and she worries more for her lady's grief then she does about me. -Dona Blanca is grieving? -She does nothing but cry since she promised to marry Don Ramiro. -But then, it's not her wish. She hasn't forgotten. Felipe, stay by my side. And if all goes as I hope, I promise that you can spend this night with your Dolores. [LAUGHING] -You must be a miracle maker. [MEN APPROACHING] -Good night, Dona Blanca. -Good night, Dolores. -[GASP] Oh. -What is it, Dolores? -Blanca! -[SIGH] Oh, Juan! -Why did you make me suffer? Make me think that you had forgotten? -Juan, I couldn't possibly forget you. My heart could not belong to you more completely I-- I did not want you to know so abruptly, but my heart betrayed me. I know I was cruel to you, but you know why. I would rather die than hurt you, but I love my father. -Your unhappiness is something I can't stand. -No, Juan. There's nothing we can do. You know my father. He loves me, but he is convinced that the well-being of his people weighs more than our sentiments. -Then you'll come away with me. -Now then, Felipe, are you coming or not? -Impossible, I am a sentinel. -You insisted so much that we begin our honeymoon, and now you only-- -I know. But now I'm under orders not to move. [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS] -[GASP] Hide, hide yourself! -Ha, ha! What have we here? -Ah, ha. I'm going to my room, there. -Going on your rounds, you. And your husband, where's he? -Him, that drunkard. Sleeping it off somewhere. He neglects me, just like I didn't exist. hm. -Ah, I'll show you to your room, shall I? Shall I, Dolores, hm? Oh, you're beautiful. You lovely creature. -Let her go! -No! No, Felipe. [GUN SHOT] -Oh, please no! [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR SHUTTING] -We never wanted to do this, Don Francisco. But there was no other alternative. -Running away like burglars, like two thieves in the night. -Don Francisco, I have always respected your daughter. -Yet you're preparing to run away, casting scorn on the name of Valverdi, which one day would have been yours. And in my delusion that you would be the son that God denied to me, you betrayed me. -Don Francisco, I know that to you our love doesn't seem important, but please do not give in to Don Ramiro. -There shall not be a war. I am determined that my people shall not suffer from your selfishness. -And for this you are ready to sell year old daughter. -Well, if you think that is true, kill me. Juan, from this moment on you are no longer part of my family. You are banished. You will leave this castle immediately and never return. [WEEPING] -Bandits! Get the net. Hold it! -Ugh! -Get him off of the horse. Ah! You thought like we were fixing the net, eh? [LAUGHING] BANDIT 1: Get a knife. -Ugh! -Hold still! -Hm, I should break your pretty knee to pay a tribe of gypsies. I would say that your pocket size ain't as fat as you are. Probably we should kill you. At least we could use your skin. [LAUGHING] Palomito has a new way of tanning leather, and he would like to experiment with it using your skin. [LAUGHING] -Assuming he's able. Anyway, I have plans for making a good luck charm out of his head. -Of course we could always string you up on a tree and then cut the rope. -Now! [YELLING] -That's it, hold onto him! -Hold him tight. We've got another one, now Agh! Hold him tight. -I had an idea that a beautiful woman would also be generous. But you disappoint me. -We'll see if that's courage or only gallantry. Set him free. I prefer my men courageous. And I will give you a chance to escape. Hercules! [MUMBLING] -You will fight against Hercules. If you survive till the sand run out, you'll have your freedom. -Ah! -Uh! [CROWD CHATTERING] GYPSY 1: Come on Hercules, finish him. [CROWD CHATTERING] GYPSY 2: Come on, Hercules, come on. The stranger will lose. GYPSY 1: Come on, Hercules. GYPSY 2: Don't look at him, Herc-- GYPSY WOMAN: Hypnotise him. DON JUAN: Ha, ha, ha. GYPSY 2: Ah, he can take it too. GYPSY 1: Watch out! Hey! [THWACK] [THUMP] [THWACK] [CROWD CHEERING] [THWACK] GYPSY 1: Come on, Hercules, side step! Another one! GYPSY WOMAN: Come on you fellas. Come on. -Uh! GYPSY 2: Slim, I told you. Ha, ha, ha. He's got him. GYPSY CROWD: Ahh! GYPSY 2: Finish him now. GYPSY WOMAN: No, no! GYPSY 1: Take him now, Hercules, you got him. -It's finished, halt. GYPSY CROWD: Ahh! [CROWD COMMOTION] -Well done! Bravo for the stranger! -Quite a fight. You're free to go or remain with us. A man as brave and gallant as you is always welcome in a gypsy band like ours. -I thank you. It's kind of you to welcome me. But remember this, I will never betray my own code of honor. -Nor will we ask you to. Now you are one of us. I knight you in the order of the forest. There! Fiesta! Fiesta! Fiesta! [CROWD CHEERING] [GYPSY DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] -Here is my palace, and these are my subjects. Once there was a king for my love. Now he's dead and they obey me. When he went hunting. -Well, that may be. But that felt a lot like a fishing net to me. You have a lot of imagination. -Well, why not? But let's find a place where you and your man can stay tonight. -Felipe? I wonder what happened to him? -He's right over there, making friends. -It's kind of you to invite me, but even with a ladder, I wouldn't go up there. -Uh-huh, it's a bit high, but it has all the comforts of home. When you're actually up there, you'll feel more secure. Palomito! -Yes! Ready Hercules. Ha, ha. -One, two, three. -[LAUGHING] Come on, Felipe. -Hah! -Ha! -Oh! Ha, ha. [LAUGHING] -You made it even without a ladder. Let's go inside. -You may go. -There it is. We've stripped my vaults and cellars of whatever little remained. -Once you've been married to Dona Blanca you won't have room enough in your cellars for all the treasures which will come in her dowry. -Might as well let that go too. I'll get it back 1,000 times. Ruiz, put all the presents together to carry to Dona Blanca. -Do you wish me to go along? -One moment! Maybe it's more useful to have you here than on the road to Valverdi. Moreover, I want to discuss my plans for war. -You're planning war? Even now, sir? -Exactly! I propose to combine, to advantage, my roles as lover and warrior. -Halt! -Ho! -This way. HORSES WHINNYING] -What did you stop for now? -There's an obstruction on the road. -Well, clear it out of the way and get moving. [THUMP] -Ah! [GYPSY YELLING] -Man the horses! [GYPSY CROWD YELLING] -Are you exhausted from your journey? Or may we impose on your good nature, senor? One for the money, two for the cloak-- Hah, ha, ha. Off with your cloak. [LAUGHING] -Isn't that a funny? -He wears a shirt with Venetian lace. Bravo! GYPSY 1: Yes he is. GYPSY 2: Ah, some more, some more. DON JUAN: Oops! [LAUGHING] What's happened? Ah, the gentleman has dropped his defenses. GYPSY 1: Where's your guards? -Better help him with his trousers, then sweep the coach completely. You can send the horse's back to the castle. You're quite an entertainer. Did you ever think of going on the stage? Ha, ha. -Oh, Oh, ah, oh! [LAUGHING] -Stop it, imbecile, I'm stark naked. Let me have your cloak. [LAUGHING] -What? Are you that happy at the arrival of Don Ramiro's men? -Oh, no Dona Blanca, but it was so funny when I saw poor Don Ruiz. He's always so pompous. Someone had taken all their clothes away from them, ha, ha. And my Felipe once told me that one of the best ways to dishonor a man was to steel his pants. But don't you understand? This must be the work of Felipe. And you saw, there must have been someone else to help him. -Juan! So he wouldn't leave. -You see, Don Juan and Felipe haven't forgotten you. You don't need to despair. -Dolores! DON FRANCISCO: Be sure that I will have my men search all the country around to flush out these robbers. What kind of man was the leader? Did you hear his name? -A devil, my lord. He was wearing a mask and a great cape of scarlet, and a sword that betrayed his bad manners. -We'll get him, Ruiz, and put him on the end of rope. You wait and see. [CHICKENS CACKLING] PEASANT: Captain! -Huh, Ah, no. One see, I told you. -These were the only one's I had left, senor officer. -Give him a dozen lashes to balance his account. PEASANT: No, no, please let me go. -Either pay Don Ramiro, or find out how you like working in the salt mines. Come on, come on, hurry up. All right, leave that here. His Excellency, Duke Ramiro has plenty of soldiers to make you obey his orders. Hurry up with those sacks. Carry them over to the mill. Well, girls which of you sweet young things is going to be the lucky one, uh? SOLDIER: The masked rider in the red cloak! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] -And this is the moron who can't choose among three pretty girls, huh? Here's the rest! Uh! Ha! Hah, hah, hah. Hold it! -Uh! Hah! -And this is for the blond. -Ah! [LAUGHING] -Esteban, should anything serious happened to me and my daughter be in need of help, take this letter to the king. Blanca will become a ward of the crown. And the lands of Valverdi will thus be safeguarded. Esteban, no one needs to know. No word about Juan? -Nothing, senor. -Go! DON RAMIRO: Stay where you are. This time it's we who have found you. -It's a very small world, huh? -Seems too crowded to me at this moment. Bring him here! -Better look at what's behind you. My dear Duke, it would be very easy now for my men to kill you, but I prefer fighting you as a man of honor, hand to hand. -Go! Hurry! GYPSY: Look! They're coming back with reinforcements. -Ah! -I make you a promise, the next time we meet will be the last. GYPSY 1: The soldiers are coming. GYPSY 2: Come on, let's get out here. Hurry! GYPSY 1: Come on! Hurry up! Hey, men, come on. -Quick! [SOLDIERS YELLING] -Don't let them go! Help me [INAUDIBLE] them. -They obviously outnumber us, and they're better equipped. -But is there enough time? -No. They'll be waiting for us to attack. With their superior strength, they'd cut us to ribbons. They're prepared for force. We'll have to find a means to outwit Don Ramiro. -You're not in a very good humor, Captain. What's on your mind? -It's your plan, Don Ramiro. I am a soldier, and I can't forget-- -I'm glad you remember, Captain. And while I pay you, you'll obey all my orders. By the way, I wish you would bring me that masked rider for my wedding present. -We search for him all the time, but he's like a phantom. -Bring him to me. I'll show you how to change your phantoms into quivering flesh and blood. Ha! Ah, the sunset will find us at Castle Valverdi. I must prepare myself to play the part of the happy fiance. -The most noble and most excellent Don Ramiro. Duke of Medina and Malacaz. -My respects to you Don Francisco, Dona Blanca, my profound homage. -But Duke, where are the friends you invited? -Well, don't you see all the officers and men I brought here with me -I see them. And they look like they're going to war. Why? -My dear Prince, I hear you've disowned your nephew, Juan, leaving, you without a male heir. Unless you designate your successor at the moment of your death, the lands would remain in the hands of a woman. That is, unless, your daughter should decide, instead, to convey them to a lawful wedded spouse. But why wait for that? Don Francisco, if you care for your health sign an act of abrogation naming me as your successor. -Never! Soldiers, to arms! -I advise that you try to behave calmly. My soldiers have seized full control of the castle. [EXPLOSION] -Just listen, that's Captain Blasco giving me the signal that the flag of Valverdi has been lowered. [SCREAMING] Uh! [SCREAMING] -The Prince is dead! -Long live, Duke Ramiro. -I curse thee. -You all saw it was a duel. Admit It. I drew only in self-defense. -He's frightened you. Cowards! -By these events you will have to remain in seclusion until after you have overcome the grief of your loss and granted your bridegroom rule over Valverdi. -Never in my life will you have Valverdi. I would wish to be dead before that should happen. -With time, you'll forget all these bitter feelings. [WEEPING] -That girl could prove to be a problem to me. The village is yours until dawn, men. [CHEERING] -Don Ramiro, was it absolutely necessary to give the men liberty? -Yes, it's part of a plan to let people know they have a new master. Captain Blasco, would you be shocked if I showed you how I punished cowards? Captain Blasco, these are the soldiers who were taken by surprise in the woods by a band of ragamuffins. They must pay dearly for this humiliation. They'll battle with whips to the death. And the one who remains last in the saddle I'll let go. -But sir, I'm their commander. It should be up to me to inflict punishment. -My dear Captain, must I always remind you you're in my employee? [CHAINS RATTLING] -Ah, there goes our famous friend, Ruiz. -Don Ramiro, I've always been your faithful servant. Don't send me to the gallows. -You won't have to go to the hangman, Ruiz. Console yourself. But they always need extra hands at the salt mines. And you may still have some muscle underneath all that fat. Take him away. Aah! [GRUNTING] [WHIPS LASHING] [GRUNTS AND MOANS] -Oh! -Hiya! [THUMP] -Ah! [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] -Ee-yow! CAPTAIN BLASCO: You have one. -Never show mercy to the defeated, show generosity to the winners. [CLANK] [LAUGHING] -Juan, I'm sorry about the death of your uncle. And that Blanca is being held prisoner. -The soldiers of Don Ramiro have committed every sort of violence in the village. -He wanted to avoid war. He was willing to bargain his own daughter for peace. ESTELLA: Don Francisco is dead, Juan. -I'll have revenge. I'll never have peace until I succeed in liberating the land from that hoard of assassins. -What do mean? -In order to save Blanca, I've got to smuggle myself into the castle. -But that would be foolish. There is a price being offered for the head of the masked rider. And don't you see, someone would sell you. -But I have to try. I can't leave Blanca in the hands of that monster. -It must be marvelous to love somebody that way. Let me help you find some way to save her. -And you would risk your life for me, and for a woman you have never seen? But why? -I know what it is to be a woman in love. And my man was killed without mercy. -By Duke Ramiro? -I suspect so. I will go with my gypsies to the castle and learn the truth. I would have to see Blanca and study the defenses. Then you must take action. -I want to use this myself on the flesh of that misbegotten cavalier with the mask. -First we'll have to catch him, though. -You don't have to worry, Captain, we'll catch him. He's become so imprudent that very soon he'll fall into my trap. He mustn't get away, I want that bandit alive. -But this wall of silence that protects him makes it very difficult. -You'll find a way then. Send them one by one to be tortured. Someone will eventually start talking. CAPTAIN BLASCO: Now that-- -There's no time for that, my poor little Blasco. Aren't you a soldier? -A soldier, sir, but not a torturer. And so, Duke, I request that I be removed from the command of your army. -But you're not indispensable, Captain. I'll let you have your liberty. But only after you've captured that masked rider as ordered. SOLDIER: You there, wait a minute. You need to have permission from His Excellency, the Duke. -I'll tell him what I want. DON RAMIRO: No, Jogi. -Right. -May I remain here among my people? -If you want, you could even have my most personal attention. -Don Ramiro, I will do for you the dance of Cinivaha. -Uh-huh. -If you're not afraid. DON RAMIRO: Huh, how could I be afraid of a beautiful girl like you, unless it was fear of your strange fascination. -Beware, Don Ramiro, the magic nerves in my dance will point one day at the killer of the man I loved. -Ha, ha, I don't think that could be. But I'll be very pleased to watch you dance. But even more, I would like your company. -Why don't you say this to your woman? -Could you prepare a love filter for my fiance, to make her change her stupid and arrogant behavior? And her past hatred, turned to love for me? -Take me to the woman. But if you want me to perform my magic, you must leave me alone with her. -Captain Blasco, accompany her to Dona Blanca and give orders that the gypsies can remain at the castle. -Come. -A gypsy girl, Dona Blanca. And Captain Blasco is bringing her inside the castle now. -If only that woman could have some poison for me. -Don't say that. If you killed yourself, you would leave a free hand to Don Ramiro. -What else is left for me now? Juan has gone away. Or they have killed him. [KNOCKING] -Please excuse me, Princess. It's an order of Don Ramiro's. Please! -Shh! Now he's gone. You are worried for your Juan. -What are saying about Juan? Do you know Felipe? -I should have guessed that your Felipe's bride. Juan and Felipe are with my gypsies hiding in the forest, so I am here to help them find a way to rescue you. I don't want to fall in a trap. Aren't you being paid by Don Ramiro to torment me. -I was sent to by Juan. You were planning to be married at the Sanctuary of San Paulo, weren't you? -Please, forgive me, it was a dream we had told to no one. What was your plan? San Paulo is fifty leagues from here. You, Blanca, must tell the Duke that you wish to be married in that sanctuary. -I marry Don Ramiro? ESTELLA: You need only to pretend that you are going to marry him. He expects me to use my magic to make you love him. -That monster! -You must pretend you're willing to except him, so he will not suspect you. And will agree to marry at San Paulo. You do the trick, Juan and my gypsies will do the rest. [GRUNTING] [YELLING] [CLAPPING] -Captain Blasco, the gypsy has made good her promise. She has bought me an obedient and loving bride. Present this to Estella. She has merited it. -It's too dangerous. It's too obvious a challenge. -I wonder, too, Palomito. If he was the assassin, at last I'll know it. -Take this! -Go and be prepared for trouble. -How beautiful you are. Even if you look sad with this mantilla you wear. It makes you seem different, somehow. Almost as if you were in mourning. -What do you know of mourning? -I have encountered death many times on the battlefield. It has passed close to me, brushing my cheek. -Like this? -No, you are like life for me, and perhaps my last chance. -You have a cold and generous heart. Why do you serve so despicable a man? -Because I'm a soldier. But in a few days, I'll be free as soon as I've completed a mission. And then I'll come to you in your camp. Take this, this is gift from Don Ramiro. -Not this. Give me something of your own. -What could I give you? I'm just a poor soldier of fortune. -I will wait for you. [GUITAR MUSIC] [SINGING IN SPANISH] -Captain Blasco. That dance, it's so strange. What's its origin? -It's an ancient dance, sacred to the gypsies. -What is the purpose of the knives? -Now they will throw them in air. And then, according to an ancient legend, they should fall around an assassin who's gone unpunished. [DANCERS YELLING] -You criminal, you. The knives have enclosed you in the circle of the magic vendetta. It was you who murdered the man I loved. -Witch! Arrest that sorceress. [YELLING] -Ahh! [THWACK] [THUMP] Uh! Ugh! -Save yourself, Hercules. And save Juan. Go, I command you. [FIGHTING] Hurry! [SCREAMING] Go! Look out, Palomito! -Hey, one minute. Watch out, here you are. -Uhh! Ha, ha. [YELLING] -Look out! Ugh! [THWACK] -Oh, oh, -Ugh! -Well, now you'll talk. I want the true motive for your coming to the castle. -Mm. The knives have answered. You're an assassin! -Tighter! -Don Ramiro. -I didn't think you'd find this sort of thing pleasant, Blasco. -I don't. DON RAMIRO: You told me that you don't like to watch torture. -May I suggest that you consider my idea? -What is it? -Well, I know what gypsies are like. She would probably die but never open her mouth. -I don't care. We might as well make an example of this one. We'll burn her alive. -The cavalier with the mask, it might be that he's involved somehow in this strange affair. If you would let me watch her, I have a feeling we would find him right away. -You want me to set her free? No, Captain! -Then have her confined in the castle. Spare her the ordeal of torture. It's a very generous act, which might put her on your side. -If you want to risk your future on a girl, but if by dawn next Monday you've not delivered to me the cavalier with the mask, that delicious body will be consigned to the flames. CAPTAIN BLASCO: I promise I'll do my best, sir. -Don't let's despair, Dona Blanca. The gypsy has been taken to the Great Hall where Captain Blasco, will question her. -And if they torture her, and make her talk? -I was watching, and I kept my ears open, too. No one will get a word out of Estella, particularly, not Captain Blasco. -What makes you think so? -Huh, the Captain is madly in love with the gypsy girl. -How did you save me from the torture? -Don Ramiro has repaid a debt. Once, long ago, I saved his life. -You should have let him die. -Hm, you're right, he's a monster. But now if I left it would jeopardize our future. Besides, he pays his soldiers very well and they're are all faithful. What could I do alone against him? -I love you, Blasco. And you must believe in our future. Listen to me, if you were given enough men to make an attack on the castle, if I put you in contact with the cavalier who hates Don Ramiro even more than we do-- [OUT OF BREATH] -And Hercules? -Here he is. -What's happened? -Estella has sent me to warn you, I didn't want to leave her but I couldn't-- -We won't abandon her Hercules. Round up the men. You'll go too. -Don Juan, I'm in more pieces than my guitar. -Hurry! -Oh! -Juan, they are arriving. -Who? -Soldiers, many on horseback. -They're coming by the secret path. They'll be here before dawn. -Sound the alarm. We must stop them before they discover the village. MAN: What is it all about? -Why are they calling, uh? What's the matter? What's he saying? [HORSES APPROACHING] -Soldiers, on horseback. Open up those pearly gates. -Let's get moving. -Halt! Dismount! This way. [THWACK] [THUMP] -Watch out now. [SWORDS DRAWING] -Oh! -Ah! CAPTAIN BLASCO: Ah, so you organized this reception committee. -Blasco! -Juan! [LAUGHING] SOLDIER: Step lively there. It will take a big fire to burn a witch. MAN: Soap, Malagatto. Put soap on the rope. -Astagor, I'll bet my pay that Captain Blasco will never bring us the neck of the masked rider. -Then we'll make that gypsy girl dance in the air instead, like so. [LAUGHING] -Juan, your idea is really crazy. I don't see how we could possibly convince him. -Blasco, believe me, there is no other way to save Estella's life than to go myself. -But your death will not serve any purpose either for you or for her. There must be another solution. -No, we'll have to risk it. Duke Ramiro doesn't know who I am. And if I get the chance, I'm going to try to convince him that I can be more useful to him if I'm alive. Blasco, the sun is about to rise, you'll see that we can carry it off. -Let's go now, they're waiting for you. [DRUMS] [CHURCH BELL RINGING] -I have given Captain Blasco the opportunity of saving you. But he has failed. SOLDIER: Here comes Captain Blasco. -No, you don't want to go there and watch her die. I beg you, Dona Blanca. -Let go of me. Oh, what can I do? There must be some way I can help her? Juan! -Manuel! -We are good? -I've kept my promise. -The gypsy can go, and don't let me catch sight of her on my land. So we meet again. Finally, I seem to have the advantage. And this time I want to know, who are you? -Someone who might be useful to you, Don Ramiro. -I have use for the devil. -But living I'd be worth much more to you. -It's a little too late for you to enter my service, if that's what you were proposing. -Juan! Oh! Oh! Juan! My love. -Juan de Valverdi! You wanted to make a fool of me, eh? Thank you for your assistance, Dona Blanca. And so, the mysterious stranger in the mask and cloak is you're cousin, the man you love. Leave it to me, I'll make you die little by little until you pray for death. -I wouldn't advise it. If you're smart you'll do away with me, quickly. -Devil, I'll break your insolence. But for that, I'll have to have you alive. -I had to bribe the chugalla to let me see you. Don Ramiro no longer trusts me. -And Blanca and Estella? What about them? -Estella's gone back to her people, and Blanca's kept under lock and key in her own apartments. -Tell me everything, Blasco. Don't try to spare me. [DOOR UNLOCKING] -Juan, tomorrow the King's envoy arrives, and Don Ramiro has demanded that Blanca consent to the wedding and grant him sovereignty her lands in exchange for your life. -That monster. It was this he was saving me for. -Blasco, you have to reach the King's envoy. CAPTAIN BLASCO: But even if I succeeded, what good would it do? What good is the captain's word once he gets in touch with Duke Ramiro. -Wait a minute, there's still one possibility, before reaching the castle tomorrow the envoy of the king must make camp at sundown at the river on the borders of the Duke's land. -Lieutenant Serrato, why have you brought me here to this water? I am the envoy of the king, not the grand admiral of the ocean. -One more little moment, Excellency. I have the honor to announce that we have been able to find strawberries. -Ah! Ha, ha. Uh, how many? The little bitty ones, perfume? -From the forest, Excellency? -Ah! -They were brought to the camp by some gypsies, Your-- -Beautiful! Firm ones? -The strawberries or the girls, Excellency? -The strawberries, Lieutenant! The strawberries! The strawberries! Ooh! [SIDE CONVERSATIONS] GYPSY 1: Stop eating like a pig. Give me some more wine. And some more food! -Come on! I love the little pies you've made. -Fellow cavalier's, I-- -Your Excellency, -Hm? -Strawberries, Excellency. -Ah, ha, ha, ha. -I saved you some. -Oh! -Hurry Ha, ha, ha. -All right! -The sleeping potion worked quickly. Tomorrow, we'll be strangers for a few hours. He won't recognize his own men. -Ha, ha. Come, to your health. -And yours -Let's go. -Oh! Oh! -A comfortable trip I hope, Excellency. -Ah, Don Ramiro, no. But what's that gloomy thing doing there? I thought it was fiesta. -I was to of hanged a highway robber. -Oh? -But I pardoned him on the occasion of my marriage. -Ah, laudable initiative. And I'll mention this to His Majesty. -Eh, too kind. -Herman, accompany His Excellency to his room. -Thank you. Whew, oh. -Master Goha! [MONKS MURMURING] -I must be a little dizzy, I-- I almost feel I've never seen you before. -It was the strawberries, Excellency. -Oh, don't talk to me of those unfortunate strawberries. They seem to be fermenting in my veins. Ah! -Everything is read, Excellency. -And where do you keep her, the kings ward and your future spouse? -Here she is. -[SIGH] Ah, how beautiful! Yes. Really marvellous. [FOOTSTEPS] -I've never seen you so lovely. Come here. I count on you not to raise suspicion in the King's envoy. Once you've signed the papers, you may pull the cord at the head of the stairs. It will ring the bell in the courtyard and give the signal to the hangman to give Juan his liberty. Come now. -Pray with me, my son. -Make it quick, Father. Because when that bell rings, I have orders to send your client to his creator. -Do you want to make a poor Christian die without the comfort of a confessor, good hangman? -Oh, certainly not. But there are so many of you. -You. Are right, hangman, but his faults, too, are many. -Shh! -I Dona Blanca, Princess of Valverdi, hereby declare that I freely advocate in full knowledge of my actions my sovereign vow in favor of my lawful wedded husband, Don Ramiro, Duke of Medina. Dona Blanca, are you ready to sign? -All right, Duke, that's all. [SCREAMING] [SWORDS CLASHING] -Uh! Uh! -Argh! -Ugh! [SCREAMING] -Ah! Uh, uh, uh, aah! [PRISONERS SCREAMING] PRISONER: Open up! Let us out of here. -Out, you're free. [CHEERING] -Have them guard the door. Come, come. All right let's go! After the guards. -Ahh! [YELLING AND CHEERING] -Juan! -Oomph! [YELLING AND FIGHTING] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] THE KING'S ENVOY: Ha, so your wonderful day has come at last. I rejoice with all, with all the nice people around here. It's such a happy day for all. A happy day for all of us, in fact. My dear princess-- [CHATTERING] [CHEERING] [LAUGHING] -Here's the key to our house. Finally, were going to be able have our honeymoon. [LAUGHING] -Be happy, Dolores. -Thank you. -Ha, ha. -Let's go. [CHEERING] [BELLS RINGING] -Hercules! Give me back my key. -Oh, this is your key? -You thief! Adios, amigo. -Adios! [MUSIC PLAYING]
