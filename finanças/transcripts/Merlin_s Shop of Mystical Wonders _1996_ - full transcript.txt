( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( BURPS ) ( GIGGLES ) Excuse me, Thomas! ( SIGHS ) Well, what should I do now, Thomas? Go on, tell me! Thomas? Why have you stopped talking to me? Thomas? Thomas Dawnston, are you there? All right, who's the wise guy? ( THUNDER ) Well, if you're not Thomas, then who are you? Identify yourself please. Ahhh... Guuu... Staaa... Laaa... Oooh. Agusta Lao? ( THUNDER ) ( WIND BLOWING ) No! ( GLASSES BREAKING ) Why are you doing this? Noo! Nooo! Uh-oh! Oh, great! Now I'm gonna miss the movie. Well, maybe it's just as well. I'm not so sure your mother would approve of you watching all that scary stuff just before going to bed. It wasn't that scary. Oh no? Well you know, actually that toy monkey reminds me of a story I once wrote for television. Let's see, what was it? Of course, Merlin! Merlin? Merlin The Sorcerer. Only it didn't take place in the time of King Arthur. You see Merlin used his powers to come to our time, to set up a shop of mystical wonders for all to see. Mystical wonders? What are you talking about, Grandpa? I'm talking about magical things, crystal balls, enchanted stones, wondrous objects that Merlin has collected over the years. What does he do with them? Why... he sells them, or even gives them away. And then, something magical happens that changes a person's life forever. Like what? Young man, are you actually asking me to tell you a story? Yeah sure, until the lights come back on. Oh really? Well here. You hold on to that, and I'll tell you the story. Only, let me see, it's been a few years so you'll have to forgive me if I can't remember it exactly as it was written. Go for it! Go for it, eh? All right. Well, the story begins in a small town in Northern California. On a starry night... ( ALARM RINGING ) Nicholas, did you see where Mommy put her keys? Susan! Hi! How are you? I haven't seen you in ages! Great! How are you? I'm okay. So how are you and Mr. Excitement? Oh, we're fine. He's around here somewhere. How about you and Mel? Not bad, no complaints. Wow, I can't get over how good you look! You must have lost... ( DOOR CREAKS ) ( OWL HOOTS ) Well! Look who we have here, our first customer! Merl! We have a visitor! Have you found something you like? Cat got your tongue? Hmm? I got the results from my doctor yesterday. Oh I'm sorry. The thing is, we haven't been getting along that wellfor some time now and well, I know he resents me for not being able to get pregnant on our own. Just getting him to go to the fertility expert was a giant blow to his ego and now after everything, when he finds out there's no hope at all, he's just gonna... SUSAN: You mean, you haven't told him? I haven't had the nerve. I just... I really wanted this baby. SUSAN: You could always adopt. Jonathan would never raise someone else's baby, you know him. SUSAN: But having a child is so important to you. Wouldn't he... No. Hello, Susan. MERLIN: Well, Mother, what do we have here? Doesn't he remind you of someone? Arthur, you old hoot. Who else? Oh, yes! Of course! How foolish of me. ( LAUGHS ) But I bet your name isn't Arthur. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. And it's Nicholas. Isn't it? Well Nicholas, do you believe in magic? You do? Oh, I knew it! Oh, you see, Mother, we're not too late. There's still hope. ( GROWLING ) That's enough out of you, Gwen, behave yourself! Oh! ( GLASS BREAKS ) That's your fault! Yes, yes. You didn't pick her up last night, did you? You know how she gets! I know. It won't happen again. Now, what could we do for our young friend? Come here Nicholas, how would you like to see one of my favorite tricks? You would? It's one of my favorite tricks! Nothing up my sleeve, oh rrrrraaaa... Hahaha! Oh, now watch closely! ( LAUGHS ) Oh! Oh. There take good care of it. JONATHAN: That's very amusing. Is that the extent of your power as magician? Oh, I'm sorry, Merlin. May we help you? Yeah, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jonathan Cooper III. Interesting shop. Heavy atmosphere. No sign of contemporary influence in design or structure. Shop is at best, overly theatrical. Uh, excuse me, was there something you wanted? What I want is a story. Oh. I am a respected columnist in this town, and I'm here to decide whether or not your shop is worthy of my readers' time and money. Worthy? What do you mean, worthy? Nicholas, what are you doing in here? Come on, you know better than to wander off like that. ( CHICKEN FLYING ) Oh! ( LAUGHING ) Where'd that chicken come from? What chicken? SUSAN: Nicholas, come on, let's go. Oh Nicholas! Come back soon. Okay? Uh-huh. Take care, Susan. Remember what I said. Call me. I will. ZURELLA: Goodbye, my dear! SUSAN: Nicholas, what were you doing... ZURELLA: Isn't he precious? JONATHAN: Merchandise consists of knick knacks, statues, various psychic paraphernalia such as crystal balls, et cetera... ( SNAKE HISSING ) So, tell me, what's all this about? Why are you here? Why has Merlin, and his wife, I presume... Zurella. Zurella, come to the 20th century? I don't like your attitude, young man. What business is it of yours... Dear, dear. Mr. Cooper, I'm here to awaken the world. JONATHAN: Awaken the world? From what? To bring magic back into the lives of those who have let science and technology cloud their perceptions. Perceptions of the powers which truly govern the universe to believe in the unbelievable. Oh, there was a time when wizards commanded the respect of kings and all shared an undisputed belief in the mystical powers which guided their lives. The objects which you see before you, Mr. Cooper, are those magical, mystical, wonders which I have collected over the years. And with them, I shall allow people to experience that belief in magic again. JONATHAN: You really believe you are Merlin, don't you? ( LAUGHS ) Storeowner's an eccentric old man who suffers from delusions of being a wizard. MERLIN: I am, Mr. Cooper, who I say I am. JONATHAN: Sure you are, pal. And I'm Lancelot. Why, you insufferable rumpus. MERLIN: Mr. Cooper, I can assure you, my intentions are entirely honorable. This is so beautiful. I've never seen anything like it. It's a laurel, a very special stone. A wishing stone. JONATHAN: Come on. For Pete's sake, Madeleine, don't encourage them. It's nothing more than a rock. Make a wish, dear. Madeleine, it's people like you that allow this kind of exploitation to go on. A most endearing wish. All right, I've seen enough. I could be a sport about this. If you're really Merlin, prove it. Show me something. As they say, knock my socks off. Ha-ha-ha! We don't give demonstrations. Sure you don't. Listen to me, OB1. Either you give me something to write home about, or your quaint little shop is history. Jonathan, let's just go. Did you hear me, old man? Do you know who I am? I am the Supreme Being. I chew places like this up and spit them into the toilet. So I'm gonna give you one last chance. You prove to me that you're Merlin the Great Sorcerer, or get off the pot. For God's sake, Jonathan, just drop it. Leave these kind people alone. Dear, why don't you give him the book? The book? Yes, dear, the book. Your book. ( WHISPERS ) What's going on? Oh, Mr. Cooper, I may have something for you that will provide the proof you seek. JONATHAN: Oh, yeah? Looks like an old book. MERLIN: Oh, that it is, Mr. Cooper. It's a book of magic, my own compilation of spells and incantations. More talk of magic? I told you, the only kind of magic I believe in is the magic I have in these fingers to make this place... ( SNAPS FINGERS ) ...disappear. Mr. Cooper, if you would just take this book home and read through it, I assure you, you will be thoroughly satisfied. MERLIN: I'm sure you will find that it makes good reading. JONATHAN: All right, you've sparked my interest, old man. I'll look through it, and you'll trust me to bring it back? MERLIN: Why certainly. Oh, Mrs. Cooper, please keep the stone. MADELEINE: Oh no, I couldn't. Dear, it's a gift. Thank you. MERLIN: You're welcome. Come on, let's get out of here. I'm sure the compilations of a mad man will make good reading. Oh, and Mr. Cooper, a few words of caution. If you decide to dabble with any of my spells, for whatever reason, be sure not to toy with any that aren't entirely there. I'm afraid that over the years, some of the pages have become brittle and sections have been broken off. So please, Mr. Cooper, heed my words, for your own sake. GRANDFATHER: And so, Mr. Cooper took Merlin's book home. Wait a minute, what did Madeleine wish for? Well, what do you think? I don't know. You'll figure it out. I spoke to Dr. Collins. Oh yeah, what did that quack have to say? Nothing. Nothing that would concern you. Oh, for Pete's sake, Madeleine. Why is it so difficult for you to show a little compassion once in a while? Or to be nice? My God, just getting along is a major accomplishment. ( READING ) Well, it would appear that I too have succumbed to the old man's charm for I hold in my hand a book of spells. Merlin's book of spells which no less promises to make me a true believer in magic. Although I must admit, the mere thought of such a thing being real is intriguing. Oh, a warning. "He beware who layeth sight on pages within." Nice touch. Must be a fuse. Okay, what do we have here? Let's see, contents. Spells, love potion, worthless. Teleportation, mmm, rejuvenation, yes, we must stay young and vital. This is incredible. What kind of mind spends hours writing this crap? Look at this gibberish, typically in Latin. Who was it that first instilled the belief that words, perhaps in their purest form, could actually command the elements. Take this special for example, "to propel away. De-ri-sera" Oh! That's what I get for screwing around. Oh! Hey, Mif. All right, debating whether to continue on with this foolishness, Jonathan Cooper decides to play wizard in Name That Spell. Here's a good one, to Levitate. "Ari-se-dare, ari-se-dare!" Ha-ha-ha look at me, I'm with wizard, Merlin! The all powerful sorcerer! Ha-ha-ha! ( OBJECTS FALL ON FLOOR ) Ooh, to summon a spirit, say three times in a commanding tone, "Vin-e-chi-re, vin-e-chi-re, vin-e-chi-re!" ( WIND BLOWS ) ( EXPLOSION ) ( COUGHING FIRE ) ( COUGHING FIRE ) ( COUGHING ) SUSAN: ( COUGHING ) What on earth is going on down here? The lights just exploded in the bedroom. It nearly scared me to death! Why are you sitting in the dark? What are you doing? Are you trying to burn the house down? Jonathan, I'm sorry. I know it's been hard but we can get through this. Having a baby... Hey, there are thousands of childless couples out there. It's nothing to be ashamed of. We just have to stop blaming each other. You haven't heard a word I've said. Leave! What is going on with you? Jonathan, you're scaring me. Dragons breath? It works? This book really works! So where's the spirit? Anybody there? Maybe I wasn't commanding enough. This is incredible! The Homing Spell. "Upon proper orchestration of this incantation, "an object may be sent away to later return." Like a homing pigeon. This is what Merlin warned me about. What did he say, "Don't toy with any spells "that aren't entirely there." Old buzzard new damn well I was going to dabble. Far be it for me to go against the Master's wishes. Call forward "Vien-e-chi-ra". Vien-e-chi-ra, I thought that was to summon the spirit. Oh, the last letter's different. Vien-e-chi-ra! ( OBJECT CRASHES ) Vien-e-chi-ra! Oh God, look at this! Cass-sorhi-basa! Cass-sorhi-basa! ( LAUGHING ) I'm rich! I'm rich! Merlin I love you! ( LAUGHING ) Drop of mercury, pinch of salt, hair of master. Tru-cor-bi! Immediately feed creature three drops. Mifi! What's he gonna do to the cat? He's gonna turn it into a familiar. A what? It's an obedient, mystical servant. The potion, when done properly, turns an ordinary animal into a magical creature that will do anything at all for its master, even give up its life. All sorcerers have one. Cool! Mm-hmm. Oh by the way, there is one very important thing to point out. Because of all the magic that Jonathan's been doing, he's aged about 15 years. How come? Well, using one's psychic powers to do magic drains your life force and causes you to age. But it's common knowledge among wizards. Life force? Trust me, you play with magic, you're gonna grow old and fast. Okay, okay, go on with the story. Now where was I? The cat! Oh, yes! The cat, the cat. Well, without a moment to lose, Jonathan apprehends the unsuspecting feline and brings her to his workbench. Yes, now you're about to learn the true meaning of obedience. ( CAT HISSES ) Hold still, stupid cat! Mifi? Mif? Mifi? Mifi? Mif? Oh, there you are! ( CAT HISSES ) Ow! Ow! Vien-e-chi-re! Vien-e-chi-re! Vien-e-chi-re! Vien-e-chi-ra! Why couldn't he make that fork come to him before? He was using the wrong spell! Vien-e-chi-re is to summon a spirit. Vien-e-chi-ra is to call something forward. You see, when you're dealing with magic, you have to be very careful. One letter can make a big difference. What? Don't be so surprised, Mr. Cooper. ( LAUGHING ) After all, did you think your newly discovered power came without a price? ( LAUGHTER ) Do you believe in magic now? ( CRASHES AGAINST WALL ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( MIRROR SHATTERS ) He knew. That damn Merlin knew this would happen! It's gotta be here. It's gotta be here. "The Rejuvenation Potion acts to replenish "one's life force from the natural effects of aging "and the excessive use of one's psychic powers." Ingredients, a pinch of sulfur, oh no! Oh no! Merlin, you bastard! ( GROWLING ) What's one letter? Ingredients, a pinch of sulfur, blood of human donor. Oh, Madeleine! ( BED SHAKING ) ( SCREAMING ) Hello, Madeleine. Jonathan? What's the matter, dear? Don't you like my new look? What have you done? It's true! He is who he says he is, he is Merlin The Sorcerer! No! Not so fast, my dear. I have wonderful things in store for us. Wonderful things. ( CRYING ) Ow! Can't waste a drop! Bel-tor-viva-ses-tra. Here's looking at you, sweetheart. It's working! It's working, look! It's working! ( MIRROR SHATTERS ) ( SCREAMING ) She got her wish! You figured it out. GRANDSON: How could I not figure it out? The whole thing with the baby kangaroo made it pretty obvious. Too obvious, huh? GRANDSON: A little. So because Jonathan was a jerk, Merlin turned him into a baby? Well, now you can't blame Merlin. Jonathan turned himself into a baby; Merlin just gave him the book. Yeah, right. Merlin knew Jonathan was going to read the spells, and he knew what was going to happen to him once he did. Oh, you think so, huh? You know I'm right. ( LAUGHS ) Well, Jonathan should never have threatened Merlin in the first place. It's not wise to get on the bad side of a sorcerer. So what about Merlin's book? How is he gonna get it back? Remember the homing spell? Oh yeah. ( YAWNS ) Uh-oh. Time for bed, my boy. Well, now wait a minute, what about the toy monkey? Oh. Oh. Oh, the monkey! Yeah, come on! You're not too tired? Grandpa. ( LAUGHS ) All right. Now where were we? Goodnight, Gwendolyn. ( SCREAMING ) Merl! Merl, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! That horrible little monkey is gone! Oh, how could you let this happen? Oh now Eli, calm down. You know how your feet swell when you get all upset. Calm down. How can I calm down knowing that awful little imp is out there somewhere? I should never have let you put that thing on display. It was for show. It added character. And who would have though some vagabond would steal it? ZURELLA:That monkey has beentrouble ever since you got it. Don't think Morgana didn't know what she was doing. Who knows what demons she imprisoned in that thing! You should never have accepted it! It was a gift on my birthday. ZURELLA: I don't care! Trouble is that conniving witch's middle name. She's had it in for you for years! But you've just been too good-hearted to see it. If I recall, you were a little mischievous yourself when we first met. Remember? Oh, you! I practically had to drown you in my love potion just to get your attention. Oh! I was just playing hard to get! And besides, you know, since your father didn't like me, I had to play my spells right. What are you talking about? Daddy liked you! He liked everybody! Nope, not me! So, he thought you were full of crazy ideas. What else is new? Do you think he would have given you his favorite rocking horse if he didn't like you? Well... Of course not, you silly old hoot. ( LAUGHS ) Oh! This is awful, just awful! And it's all your fault! If only you placed that homing spell on that monkey, like I told you to, we wouldn't be in this mess. I know, I know. If I only knew where he took it, I could... ZURELLA: That's it! Oh! We've gotta get out there and track it down! That thief must have sold it by now or maybe even traded it for food. You've gotta get out there and find that thing before it gets into the wrong hands! But where do I start? It could be anywhere! I don't care! Just get out there and be creative, now go! Don't I get a kiss? You'll get a lot more than that if you don't go out there and find that thing, now go! ( LAUGHS ) Why is Zurella so upset? Because the monkey is no ordinary toy. What do you mean? An evil spirit lives inside the toy, and Zurella is afraid it might hurt somebody. How did that evil spirit get in there? Well, it was imprisoned by the evil witch Morgana, Merlin's archenemy. Oh, but that's another story. Okay, okay. Go on. You sure you're not too tired? Grandpa! Okay, all right. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Hey, it looks like a great day for the fair. DAVID: I know, I know. It's all I've been hearing about all week! ( LAUGHS ) Hey, what's going on here? Sorry girl, you can't come with us this time. Hey, come on. Sparkle, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Atta girl. Oh, come on, David, can't she come? DAVID: First of all, the name is not David. It's Dad to you. Okay, Dad, can't she come? Look, it's gonna be too hot in the car, son, you don't want her to get sick do you? MICHAEL: No. Okay. Hey buckaroo, how about if I take care of Sparkle while you go to the fair? Okay. PETE: Come on, Sparkle, let's go. Atta girl. DAVID: Thanks, Pete. Just put her in the garage when you go in, if you don't mind. Will do. Have fun, Buckaroo. ( CAR STARTS ) Bye, Sparkle! ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Merl, where are you? You've been gone so long. There you are. What are you doing in that store? You don't get ice cream at a time like this. No, no, no. You're in the wrong place. You've got to look further. Concentrate. Come on, be creative. Where could it be? I don't know. ( CLAPPING ) All right? Alright pilgrim, I want you to take a deep breath, make a wish, and blow 'em all out. ( LAUGHING ) ( CHEERING AND CLAPPING ) Come on, hurry up! Yeah, I wanna see your presents! Can we open my presents now? DAVID: Don't you wanna eat your cake first? Nah, we could eat it later. DAVID: All right, go for it. The big one! DAVID: Open mine! Open mine! GIRL: Open the red one! Hey, why don't you open Susan's first? Okay. DAVID: Here we go. Oh! Whoa! Where did you ever find that? Look at that! ( CYMBALS ) ( GIGGLING ) Thanks! You're welcome. Now let's open the big one. Yeah! DAVID: Yeah, yeah. PETE: Let's see what's that, what's in there? Oh, what's it gonna be? Come on, open it up! Yeah! Oh! Wow! ( KIDS PLAYING ) BOY: Chewbacca's dead. ( MUMBLING ) Ha ha ha ha. Martianstien. Rock and roll Martian. Rock and roll Martian, ha ha ha ha. ( LAUGHING ) Oh, I think it was a success. I think you're right. Hey, bring that thing over here a minute, would you, Mike? Can I play with it for a minute? Sure! Isn't he adorable? Hey, where'd you find this thing? Oh, you know that junk antique store off the boulevard? Yeah. I saw it at the window as I was passing by, and I just couldn't resist. I thought you said the monkey was dangerous? It is! But it hasn't done anything. Everybody likes it. Give it time. It may not do anything that night, but the next day. Well, strange things start to happen. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) What are you doing in there? ( LAUGHING ) God, you scared the hell out of me! Hey, I just came over to see what the hell you're tearing apart. Aw man, I'm gonna go back to bed. So far today, I have broken my toe and fractured my skull. Aw! I was tightening a clamp on the air conditioner hose, been meaning to do it for a while. Finally got to it. You know how long it took? Yeah. Five minutes. PETE: Uh-huh. Playing gardener today? Well, I was gonna put some shrubs in, but I think I'll work on the old scooter for a while. Oh yeah? Expecting a visit from Better Homes and Gardens anytime soon? One would have to wonder the way you've been attacking that lawn. I'm just trying to clean the place up. God knows I've neglected it long enough. Well, your lawn always looks, uh... Yeah, right. ( LAUGHING ) ( PHONE RINGS ) I'll be right back. Yeah, well, I'll be out here awhile. I got a little bit to do. ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello? Oh, hello, Mother! How are you? No, everything's fine. Michael's fine, we're all fine. Yeah. You enjoying your trip? Great. Great. When are you coming home? Okay, in three days. Well, call me. Call me and let me know when to pick... No, don't be silly, Mother. Look, don't you dare take a cab. I'm perfectly able to pick you up. Good. Okay, well, enjoy the rest of your trip. Yeah. Okay, I'll look forward to seeing you too. Okay, I will. All right, see you in a few days. Bye-bye. ( FLY BUZZING ) ( CYMBALS ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Get away from me. I have mace. Oh please, please, I mean you no harm. I'm simply trying to find this toy monkey. By chance, have you seen it? Um, actually yes. I'm... I'm sorry for the way I behaved. It's just that... There's no need. Well, no, it's just that this isn't a very good neighborhood. I mean, you wouldn't believe the weirdos. You just can't be too careful. You know, I mean, I know mace is illegal and everything... Of course, of course so. I understand. But you've said you've seen the monkey? Yes, um, yesterday this weird guy brought it in. I gave him $5 for it. You have it? No, I'm sorry I don't. It sold shortly thereafter. Blast it! Look, I should be getting back to work. Please, by chance, do you have any information on the person who bought it? No, I'm sorry. She paid cash for it. Oh, I see. It was yours? Uh-huh. Stolen from my shop. I hope you find it. Have a nice day. Bye. ( MONKEY'S CYMBALS ) Michael? Michael? Michael? Michael? Oh! God. Oh, Michael, you scared me to death. Hi, Dad! ( LAUGHING ) God. Come here, give me a kiss and a hug.Okay. Where's Sparkle? I though you were playing with her? I put her in the garage so when I scared you, she couldn't make noise. You rascal! You planned this whole thing? ( LAUGHS ) Yup! Well, it worked. You scared me. I think I'll go let her in now. Okay, go. ( TOY LASER GUN ) Charlotte. I think we must have given her too much food, son. Yeah, but she was so skinny. Well, she's supposed to be skinny. Fish aren't made to eat very much. Can we bury her now? Yeah, we can. We'll put her right out front, okay? ( SINISTER LAUGH ) I'm the old pincushion man, terror of bologna land. Folks all hate me, how they hate me... Oh, hi Mike! Hi. So, where's your dad? ( GLASS BREAKING ) Never mind! Hi! Hi. What did you do? I cut myself. Oh, Mr. Goodwrench. ( BANGING ON GARAGE DOOR ) PETE: Hey! Yeah? PETE: Hey, Dave? ( BANGING ON GARAGE DOOR ) Yes, Pete? PETE: Hey, are you in there? Yes, Pete. PETE: Well, get out here! I need some help working on a... All right, I'll be right out. Always wants something, doesn't he? ( DOG WHINNING ) Anything good on? Cartoons! Cartoons? What you need? I gotta time this thing. Could you get in and turn it over a couple of times for me? Sure. ( CARTOONS PLAYING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( YELPS ) ( DOG WHINNING ) ( CARTOONS PLAYING ) I'll get buff! I'll get tough. I'll just call his bluff. Oh no! Oh no! ( DOG CRYING ) ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) Do it again. ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) Hold it. I'm not gonna be able to do it like this, not mechanically. I'm gonna need my timing light. You wouldn't know where it, would you, old buddy? Uh, it's probably in my garage. You probably left it in there. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. ( LAUGHS ) I'll go get it. ( DOG CRYING ) Sparkles? ( MONKEY'S CYMBALS ) Sparkle? Sparkle! ( COUGHS ) Sparkle! Stay inside! Oh! Stay here, honey. David what happened? It's okay. You okay? It's out. Yeah. It's out. Where's Sparkle? I'm sorry, Mike. Sparkle's dead. No! The monkey killed the dog? I told you, it's a bad toy! What happens next? Does it kill Michael? Now you're getting ahead of me. First things first. You see, David, Michael's father starts to get suspicious, so he calls a psychic friend of his. A what? A psychic. You know, someone who can see into the future, talk to ghosts. You know, a clairvoyant... Oh, a clairvoyant. Why didn't you say so? Anyway. He tells her about the strange things that have been going on, and she, being sensitive in that area, senses that something in his house might be possessed by an evil spirit. Well, it doesn't take long to figure out what it could be. DAVID: So what did you learn from your reading? Just a refresher. I remembered that demons can only be brought into this world through someone who already exists here. They can't come on their own. Sometimes demons are brought here unwillingly, causing them to be volatile and hostile. Well, aren't they already volatile and hostile? I mean, they are demons. Yes. But they can be worse when they're conjured without their consent. Look Adrian, I've been thinking. My son just had a birthday, and one of his presents was this antique toy monkey. Oh, I see. Sit down right there, Dave. You're not going to like this, David, but we have a very serious situation here. Now unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to deal with it personally because of its nature; you're going to have to deal with it alone. Why do I have to deal with it alone? Well, listen to me, David. As a psychic, I have an aura of a certain nature that the demon would unquestionably sense. The moment I stepped into your house, all hell would break loose, literally. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do? I don't know anything about evil spirits. Get that toy out of your house. I have a feeling that's not going to be so easy to do. What's that? It's called a bethogram. DAVID: It's supposed to protect me from the demon, huh? Yes. Just keep it in your possession at all times. Great. Should I wear garlic around my neck too? My god, David! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I appreciate your help, but I just wish you could come. ADRIAN: I know! I am sorry. I wish I could do the exorcism for you, but this is something you'll have to do on your own. And remember, David, never let it know! PETE: Hey, Dave! Hi. Man, you look terrible. Thanks. When's the last time you got some sleep? I think it was the week before last. That bad, huh? Yeah, yeah. Is there anything I can do? As a matter of fact, yeah. Name it. Can you take Mike for about an hour? No problem. I'm gonna go downtown, get some parts for the car, run a few errands. Oh, great. Hey, if there is a friend of the year award, buddy, you get it. No problem. Listen, send him over as soon as you want, and we'll go. Great. Thanks, Pete. PETE: Get some sleep! ( MONKEY CYMBALS ) Hi, Dad! Oh, Mike! Come here a second, Mike. Hey, Pete's gonna go shopping. Why don't you give him a hand? In his old Chevy? Yeah! Yeah, take off. Go. Okay! ADRIAN: ( A MEMORY ) Remember, David, never let it know that you're aware of its presence. DAVID: Do you think it would know? ADRIAN: Yes. ( WHISTLING ) Damn! Bingo! Bye-bye. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Surprise! Hey, hi! What's in the bag? Well, Mikey and I went down to the store. You didn't look too good earlier so I though we'd poolour resources and cook tonight. Oh great! I feel fine now though. Yeah? You take a nap? No, I cleaned the house. Oh very interesting. And so of course, this makes you feel better, hm? DAVID: Exactly. Yeah, sure whatever. Say, do you do windows? ( LAUGHS ) ( KNOCKS OVER TRASH CAN ) Hey, baby. What's happening? Bug off! Nooooooo!!! Watch out! Oh, shit! ( CAR BRAKES ) Look out! DAVID: Michael! Hey, Pete! Get him inside, will ya? Hey, Mike, you all right? What the hell you doing? Get him inside! PETE:Why didn't you watch where you're going? I was! I didn't see him! Yeah, you're looking at pretty ladies. You okay? What's going on? Where are you going? Get Mike inside, I'll be back in 10 minutes! You're gonna have to do better than that, you little bastard! Let's see you get out of this! God help me! ( THUNDER ) ( LAUGHING ) Ahhhh! MAN: ( ON TV ) It's a trap! ( CARTOONS PLAYING ) ( PHONE RINGS ) Hello? Oh, hi, Mom! Where are ya? Okay I'll be right down. Oh, she is, huh? Okay, yeah. You did, huh? Yeah I'm sure he'll be surprised. Okay, I'll see you in a little while. Yeah. Bye-bye. Hey, grandma's at the airport. She'll be here in a little while. All right! Why don't you go make sure your room is clean, huh? Okay. And put on a clean shirt while you're at it, will ya? I like this shirt. Michael, that shirt is filthy. Will you change it so Grandma doesn't think I've been falling down on the job? Okay. Well, look at you. What gypsy ring do you belong to? Gypsy ring? Yeah, what's with the costume? It's certainly not Halloween. Forgive me. Jake Cosgrove. Nice to know you. Merlin. Of course. So Merlin, well, you look like a man who likes his trinkets. As it happens, I own a small trinket stand across the way. Well, it's uh... it's no use. Well, you never know. I got a lot of stuff. Well, no, no, no, no. It's my monkey. I've looked everywhere. I just, I can't find it. You lost a monkey? What, a chimpanzee from your show? No. A toy monkey. A toy monkey? You mean, the kind with cymbals? You've seen it? That's the damnedest thing. This morning, some bum walks up and says for a dollar, he'll give me this toy monkey. You know, like the one you're looking for. It was in good condition, so I said okay. You've got it? You're not going to believe this, not about an hour ago, an old lady pulls up in a car and offers me 20 bucks for it. Twenty bucks! I couldn't believe it. So, you sold it to her? Damn right. I would've given her half my cart for 20 bucks. Well, did you get her name or where she lives? Anything? Well actually, yeah. Her name's Marie Andrews. 312 Maple Drive. Granted I don't usually accept checks, but she looked respectful enough. ( CHATTERING ) Oh, thank you, darling, so much! I'll give you a call. FEMALE DRIVER: Oh, please do! Ok darling, alright. DRIVER: Bye-bye! Mary! Oh, my I've missed you! Welcome home! Oh, thank you so much! Why didn't you call me? Oh well, Sarah... I would have come to get you. ( GROANS ) Sand in here? Sarah was at the airport which worked out just wonderfully. You have the best luck, I swear. Oh, tell me, how are you, Pete? Fine. Oh, good. And do you have any new old cars to tell me about? Well, I sold the old Chevy, and I'm gonna start on the old Buick next. Oh, great. How is everything? Fine, except that son of yours is a lousy cook. Oh! ( LAUGHS ) And how was Hawaii? Wonderful! ( LAUGHING ) Well, Pete, I might just tell him you know. Grandma! Oh, Michael! How are you, darling? Oh damn, wouldn't you know it, Mary, there's my phone. I'll talk to you later. All right, Pete. Thank you so much! PETE: Welcome home. Oh, thank you! Michael, how are you? Fine. Is that for me? DAVID: Is that you, Mom? Yes! How was your birthday? Did you have a party? Yeah. Can I open my present now? Well, take it over to the table and wait till Dad comes. Okay? Okay. DAVID: Mom! MARY: Hi! Oh David! What has happened to you? Don't even ask, Mom. Have you been in an accident or something? Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Can I open my present now? Please, Grandma! Please? Yes, dear, you may. David, are you sure you're feeling all right? I'm sure, Mom, just fine. I'm fine. Hey, did you see how well I took care of your plants? Oh, they're beautiful! I can't believe how much they've grown! ( LAUGHS ) Dad, look! Isn't it, darling? Michael, go outside! David? Don't ask questions, Mom. ( BOTH TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ) David, David! Mom! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAVID: Open it! MICHAEL: I can't! David! Get out of the way, Michael! MICHAEL: Dad! DAVID: Run faster! Go! Get in the car! Mom, there's no time to explain now. Just get into the car! Michael, get in... Oh! You found it. Sweetheart, you can come home now. GRANDPA: And so with the monkey back in Merlin's possession, Merlin could return home with renewed hope. Of course he'd still have to decide what to do with the monkey to ensure nothing like this ever happened again. MERLIN: I'll deal with you later. But for now, content that everything was back to normal, Merlin could re-open his shop and continue his quest to inspire the hopes and dreams of all those whose lives would soon touch his own. Goodnight, boy. My goodness, you've grown big. There you are. ( MUSIC PLAYING )
