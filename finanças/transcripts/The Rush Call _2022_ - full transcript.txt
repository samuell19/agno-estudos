(static sparks) [Operator] Rosalie at 536. [Dad] And that makes us have a great house. [Officer] Yeah, I'll be 23 back on the found property case and I'll be 76 to the Williams Road address to see if I can find Amber. Mrs. Stevens, this is Detective Stokes. She's working on Jared's case. [Stokes] And you don't think your husband knew anything about it? No, he said she had an accent, British I think. Is Jared in trouble? Doubtful, we've ID'd the guy we think is behind it. His whereabouts are currently unknown. Maybe he fled the country. Have your husband call me if he has any further information. Thank you, detective.

Yeah, so? Those aren't the words. It says like a diamond in the sky. Yeah, well, I like my way better. Dress-up and diamonds are the best. Well, maybe someday we can buy our own rocket and fly away into our own sky. You're such a dreamer. Molly, it's time to go. I gotta go. You shoot for the stars, I'll shoot for the diamonds. [Reporter] 46 at Concord, our coolest reading in Bloom checks in at 36, 45 in Shelby, down in Lancaster in South Carolina, 46, Chester checks in at 52 degrees, fair skies down there. Nationwide, the southeast extremely warm. Look at that high today 87, Orlando, Miami 83. Temperature in Atlanta, Georgia, Nashville tops out about 70, Dallas, 70. Then we go into winter cool temperatures, 4 degrees. That's the high temperature in Minneapolis. High today in Bismarck, North Dakota, 6 below zero, high temp, 20. Good morning, my ladies. Morning, Dad. [Molly] Good morning, how'd you sleep? Oh, pretty good. Really, 'cause you talked in your sleep all night. Really? Well, I did have the strangest dream. I dreamt that we were kids again playing dress-up in the backyard. You had on your princess dress and I had on my spacesuit. Was it the spacesuit? - Yes, it was. - Ha! Wait, do you mean the spacesuit that Grandma has pictures of in her living room? Yeah, that's the one. I used to wear it everywhere. Grandma was just telling me stories about your spacesuit and she said one time you didn't take it off for three days straight. Yeah, that's until my dad got tired of it. He said I was too old to be playing dress-up and wearing a spacesuit. When I refused to take it off, he picked me up and put me in a bathtub. Did she tell you that? [Ellie] What? Yeah, it ruined it. I was devastated. I mean, you know that spacesuit was the one thing I can put on and feel like I could go anywhere, you know? I could do anything, I could be anyone. You know, when your mom found out what happened, she came over to my house the next day with a picture she drew of my spacesuit. She said she didn't want me to ever forget it. Aw, that's such a cute story. Well, he did promise to go to space and get me a diamond. Remind me, why space? Because I used to think the stars were actually diamonds. Well, maybe there are. I mean, there's a whole universe out there we don't know anything about. So many stars and each one has its own role to play. Oh, don't forget I have drama club, so pickup is later. That's right, you get to hang out with Ms. Dee. Yeah, she's awesome! She's always talking about you and mom. I wish I could go to performing arts school like y'all did. Well, maybe you can. I think you can do anything you put your mind to, sweetie. Speaking of performing, I actually have an audition tonight. Wanna help me shoot it? [Ellie] Yeah! [Jared] All right, ladies, I'm off to tackle the world. Bye. (phone rings) Pike Entertainment, Joe Pike speaking. [Jared] Hey, Joe, it's Jared. Jared, my man! It's nice of you to finally call me back. Yeah, sorry, man. Work's been really busy lately. I'm just trying to stay on top of my family duties. [Joe] Listen, I get it. You cranked out some really good auditions, you missed a few. I'm still submitting you constantly, but I can't have you miss auditions like this. In fact, you have self-tape auditions due today! Can I count on you to knock those out? [Jared] Yeah, I'm hoping to after work today. Have you even looked at the sides? [Jared] Not yet, planning to at lunch. You gotta be prepared to seize every opportunity whether minor role or audition. Auditioning's the work and you're missing it. Are you sure you still want this? Of course, I mean, I don't know. It's been awhile since I booked anything. I was kind of thinking of taking a break and just hanging up my spurs for a bit. I can stop submitting you if you want, but I'm gonna be cleaning up my roster soon. So I'm gonna need you to convince me to keep you on it. Copy that. (Jared sighs) Good morning, sunshine. Did you catch the game last night? Skiing? What are you serious? The game, I was in the box seats with JP and the whole crew. We were out I don't even know how late it was. I'm surprised I'm even vertical today. Sounds great, go team! I'm kind of busy, Myles, what's up? Word on the street is that Miranda's got some big company announcement this afternoon, you ready? No, yeah, look, I'm really swamped trying to catch up on this report, man. [Myles] You want my advice? Not really. Too bad, you're gonna get it anyway. Take a moment. At lunch, go outside and do your yoga breathing or whatever. Get focused, man. Focused. Copy that. This is possibly the grossest pizza I've ever eaten. It's cold and rock solid. Exactly. Anyways, it's great. You booked the lead role, Ellie. I'm in the presence of a star. May I have your autograph, Ms. Stevens? You, too, Jordan. Honestly, it's super crazy we get to co-star together and it's my first big role and I get to do it with you. Also, how did you learn how to speak like that? This accent? Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. That's so accurate. Where did you learn that. Well, we lived in the UK for a stint while I was in elementary school, so I just picked it up and it stuck with me. That's so cool. Do you think you could teach me? The British accent, seriously? [Ellie] Yeah. Sure, wanna run lines over lunch? Yeah, let me just text my dad real quick. Well, team, we are on the short list for the Morgan account. All right! (team applauds) This could be the largest account we land in our company's history and it would not have been possible without each and every one of you, thank you. I called this meeting because I wanna assign a dedicated project team to close this deal. Nice! I put a lot of thought into this team and the skill set that it takes to lead with the fast approaching timeline. You are in this room because I am happy to announce you are the team. All right! (team applauds) And your team leaders will be Myles and Jared. (Myles laughs) Awesome! [Miranda] These two will lead this transaction and gentlemen, your lives are going to change. Every news outlet in the country will announce this transaction, congratulations. Or every news outlet will announce we lost it. Is this a joke? [Miranda] Excuse me? You're letting newbie here run the deal? Are you questioning my management? No, what I mean... Back to what I was saying unless anyone else in the room would like to take it upon themselves to tell me how to run this company. Thanks for your vote of confidence, Miranda. We could not be more ready for this. Yes, thank you. Don't thank me, you earned this. Now, we will meet weekly to stay on top of progress and gentlemen, I'm sure you understand the time commitment that this will involve. Congratulations. (phone rings) Dude, what? Team leads, are you kidding me? It's like a dream come true working with my brother on the biggest project ever. Don't let Brooks get in your head, man. He's an idiot. "Why me?" I'll tell you why, 'cause my brother is awesome! Hey, let's get some drinks afterwards, all right? We'll celebrate. Sounds good, I just can't believe it, Myles. Why me? I mean, Brooks is a jerk, but he's been here longer, man, he's more experienced. I don't know why you do this. Why you? Because you're amazing. I know it, Miranda knows it. I don't know why you sell yourself short, man. You know what? I'm not gonna do this with you, so just stop. This is your path now. This is our path now. God put you right here, right here. Sorry, dude. Drinks, yes, but just one. Mom and Dad and coming over for dinner and I need to shoot an audition first. Audition, you're not gonna have time for that here pretty soon, big guy. It's gonna feel so good telling Dad about this. You know, he's gonna be ecstatic for you, but he may also be a little jealous. You know, he had the biggest... Ah, the biggest deal in the '70s when the two largest banks merged, it made his career, made him the man he is today. We've heard the story 1,000 times, Myles. You know, he just wants what's best for us. I would give my South Beach condo just to see his face when you tell him. Oh man, it's gonna be great. Can we grab that drink? Meet you at Dot's? (blues music) [Myles] Cheers, to the Morgan account. (blues music) It's a promotion, bro, thought you'd be a little more excited. Yeah, just I'm at a different place than I thought I'd be, you know? Well, when opportunity calls, you gotta be able to take it. You are destined to be fame and stardom. This probably seems a little mundane, huh? That makes sense. It's a good company. It's a great company. That's why I got you the job. It's a dream career. It's your dream career, Myles, it's not mine. Look, I know that you've only dreamed of lights, camera, action. Well, this is kind of like acting, right. You get to write your own script, that's the presentation. You learn your lines, you perform for the boss. You've always been a dreamer. That's one of the things I love about you, but maybe it's time you get your head out of the clouds, time to grow up. Now you sound like Dad. That's not a bad thing, man. You'll excel at this, you know, make some money. I know times are tight. It's not about the money, Myles. It's about time, you know, fulfillment, purpose. Your purpose is provide fulfillment for your family. Little Ellie of yours has got your talent. I'm pretty proud of her. She's gonna be a great actress. Oh shoot! [Myles] Dude, I'm just saying. No, I'm late to pick her up from drama club. (blues music) Head in the clouds, brother! Well, Bobby, I guess I am drinking both of them. Do you know what was going on with Connor today? I don't know, he could not get his lines right. It was exhausting trying to work with him. Yeah, hopefully it'll get better. [Jordan] Yeah, it better. You don't think it was Ms. Donovan, do you? [Jordan] No, she usually has it more together than that. Yeah. Anyways, do you wanna come over, hang out? We could order pizza or rehearse, watch a movie. My parents aren't getting home till late because they have some event at the country club. I would love to, but I have dinner with my grandparents and I have to help my dad with an audition. That sounds awesome. I cannot tell you the last time I've sat down to have dinner with my family. Anyways, I'll probably end up ordering pizza and watch a movie by myself, of course, using my parent's credit card. Are you sure you don't need a ride home? My dad should be here soon. I don't know where he is, though, I guess. No, it's fine, but I'll wait until he gets here. I can wait here with Jordan if you wanna get going. It's okay, sorry that he's late. I texted with him earlier today, but I guess he forgot. No worries, I'm fine waiting with her until he gets here. You know, he was always late in college, too. [Jordan] You went to school with Ellie's dad? [Ellie] Yeah, you knew this. You never told me. Yes, I did. Whatever. Okay, I'm just gonna call him again. Hey, sorry I'm late. Well, not much has changed, huh? Just kidding, no, I love waiting here with the girls. It's fine. Bye, Ms. Donovan. Plus Todd knows I never leave this place on time. He's used to it. Sorry I was late. Oh, wait. How is work for you? Well, actually going pretty good and I'm thankful for that. Does it leave you any time for acting? Not much if I'm gonna be honest. You know your girl, she is amazing. She is one of the most authentic actresses we've had here in years, she is. She's really gifted. Wow, thanks, Amy. Ellie loves it and I think she's pretty amazing if I do say so myself. I figure if I can't make it in this industry, I'll do everything I can to help her. Jared, all right, everything that is created begins within the mind, remember that? You've already made it, you just have to think whatever truly makes you happy to think. This is why we've been friends for all these years. I think I might start crashing your coffee days with Molly. Well, come join us anytime. I love that the two of you still make time to hang out. She always looks forward to her coffee days. That is the highlight of my week. We love complaining about our husbands. [Ellie] Dad, we need to go. Coming. Look, you're gonna get a earful about me being late for dinner tonight, so just do me a favor and take the blame. Will do. I refuse to stand by and watch this happen. I'm done sacrificing my integrity for you or anyone else. Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear? [Molly] Cut. Whew! Nice job, Dad, you still got it. Yeah, I never felt confident with my auditions and my slate always seemed so goofy, you know? I just hope I can juggle it. How do you do it? One step at a time, one role at a time and having good people around you. You know I couldn't do any of this without your mom. She is pretty awesome. Yeah, she is pretty and awesome. She's always been my greatest encourager. I wanna be like you both. I mean, I love acting, but it seems like Mom had some pretty important roles backstage, too. I just hope I can get into the drama program when I'm in college. I know it can be pretty expensive. Now, don't you worry about that, kiddo. The universe has a way of working these things out and your mom and I are behind you every step of the way. Some of my friends' parents aren't as accepting. Hm, I know how that is. It can definitely make the journey a lot more challenging, but just like a scene in acting, you look at your objective and you find tactics and strategies to work around your obstacles. And always stay true to yourself. What do you mean? Authenticity, if you deny the real you in order to pretend just so you can fit in, you end up frustrating yourself and disappointing those around you. Always be your authentic self, no matter what because you are the greatest gift you can give those around you. (light music) Molly, this is delicious. Thank you so much for making this lovely meal. Of course, my pleasure. So son, Myles tells me you have some big news? Of course he told you, Dad. I actually got a promotion at work. That's fantastic, son! Oh, that's wonderful news. [Dad] Tell us more. Well, actually, Myles and I both have been chosen to lead the team that is in charge of trying to land the largest acquisition in our company's history. Wow, like father, like son. Very good. It's exciting and I'm extremely grateful. But actually, Ellie has some news she'd like to share as well. Well, I got the lead in the school play and I would love for you guys to come see it. Good job, Ellie. Jared, that promotion means that you're in line now to be a partner in the firm. Possibly, Dad, but we're really proud of what Ellie has going on. I mean, she's worked so hard and she's shown such dedication. We're really proud of her. Ellie, dear, that is wonderful. Hobbies are good, but you have to know the difference between a hobby and a career. Just be sure you keep up at school. How are your grades? Ellie is a straight A student and we are very proud of her for that. But what makes her most outstanding is her passion, love for life and seeing the world through Ellie's lens. And in this house, we teach career and life is a road you enjoy traveling, even if it's a less traveled one. But you have to make a living if you travel. Lord knows it took Jared a long time to figure that out. Proud of you, son. (fire crackles) (fire crackles) Hey. Your mom was so sweet to help clean up before they left. And Ellie says she's going to bed early. She is happily exhausted from all the drama club excitement. You doing okay? At what point do you think he'll realize that maybe I won't grow up, you know, that this is the real me all grown up? He's not a bad father. He successfully loved my mom, he took care of us. He just wasn't... Present. Yeah. (soft music) My biggest fear is that I'd be just like him, you know, that some job would keep me so busy, take me away. Something else would keep my attention so I couldn't connect. You are a great dad and a wonderful husband. It's just your dad, he's from a different generation. Even when we were kids, I can remember him planning out every detail of your life and at the time being sort of jealous. (soft music) Forgive me, I sound so spoiled. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be insensitive to your situation. No worries, babe. Plus, I got to connect with you best on and off stage. (Jared laughs) (Molly laughs) But you were a good actress, too. Thank you. But you know I really liked tech crew, being behind the scenes, backstage, coordinating the wardrobe, helping with casting. That's really where I found my place. And from there, that's where I saw you find your place. You were so good at improv, moving from one unanticipated moment to the next, being present and authentic, no matter what role you were in. It's what I loved about you. It's what I still love about you. No matter if you're on stage or in real life, you just... You continue to live truthfully in any circumstance. (soft music) (soft music) (fire crackles) (light music) Time to come inside, son. Dinner's ready. (light music) After dinner, you have homework, okay? Middle school's no joke. You're getting older now. Don't you think it's time to stop playing around and give up on this make-believe? Go get your things. Take off that ridiculous costume, okay? (light music) Sorry, I guess I'll have to save you another day. I'll be waiting. [Dad] Son, let's go! Dinner's getting cold. Hey, Jared? Never give up on make-believe. (light music) (light music) Hey, I need to get going. Something wrong? Miranda called a meeting first thing, I just need to be sure I'm not late. Well, remember we're down to one car and I need it. Is that gonna mess you up? No, I just need to leave now. I'll take the train. Oh, then who's gonna take me to school? I'll take you. And remember it's a late night tonight. It's my last week of rehearsals. All right, break a leg, my little movie star. Shine like a diamond. Nothing less. Mom, I hate seeing Dad so stressed. Your dad is a man of many talents. Yeah, he's a little bit more stressed, but he loves the chaos life throws at him. He'll be okay. One day when I make it big, he's gonna be the star in my production. He would like that. Ellie, but remember your dad's favorite thing in this entire world is his family. He will do anything to provide and make us happy. And one day a door will open, even if it takes a little push. [Ellie] What does that mean, Mom? (station chiming) [Announcer] Always stand behind the white textured running strips. You look like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. Yeah. Sorry for the imposition, I just couldn't help but notice it. No worries. You a therapist or something? (stranger laughs) Yeah, something like that. More like a student, an observer of people 'cause I get around. I like to meet and make new friends, you know. Find that having a chat with a stranger is sometimes more beneficial than having a chat with someone you know. Tell me about it. So many conversations lately, I feel like no one gets it. No one gets me. Gets what? That you're a middle-aged man doing the best he can for his family and while also wanting more for himself, but second guessing all life decisions? Is it that obvious? Like I said, I get around. Are you happy? Yeah, relatively speaking, yeah. I have a great family, wife, daughter. Just feel aimless at times. I mean, I have options and opportunities, I just... They're just not the ones I thought I'd have at this age. Choppy seas. What's that? Choppy seas, you know, getting tossed to and fro in the waves of life. Just remember it's in those seas that you find out what you value most and you cling to what's most important to you. It's your anchor, you know. Can I ask you a question? If you could do anything in life and know that you wouldn't fail, what would you do? I don't know. See, that's what you need to figure out. Be bold, what's the worst that could happen? I lose my job, lose my family, lose my life. And what's the best that can happen? I gain everything. (light music) Is it really that easy to figure me out? (stranger laughs) It's normal, man. You're human. Just remember you are a human being, not a human doing. Life's not about what you do or we do. It's about, I don't know, it's about who you are, it's who you're becoming. I just never thought I'd be this ordinary. I mean, what's wrong with that? I mean, you don't have to do anything spectacular to make your mark on this world. You don't have to be outstanding in your field in order to find fulfillment. What's that supposed to mean? Means maybe you shouldn't neglect the present by looking beyond what you've been given here and now, that maybe living a life of wonder isn't about doing spectacular things, but living each day in wonderment and passing that on to your kids. I mean, you do that and maybe your ordinary life will be spectacular. (bell rings) (bell rings) [Announcer] Train to High Grain Park arriving in five minutes. (foreign language) Aren't you getting on? I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. You're the one who needs to figure out where you're going. (soft music) (light music) Thank you for waiting with Ellie. Jared's just been a bit off, so... Yeah, he seemed kind of stressed. He didn't really talk about it, though. Okay, I know I say this all the time, but Ellie is amazing! Her talent is incredible and you and Jared, you should really think about putting her into a special school or at least like an agency. She is amazing, but we can't afford it. You sure? Up until Myles got Jared this job, I thought we were gonna lose the house. Oh, Molly. You cannot tell anyone that. [Amy] Of course not. Jared would be so mad at me. To think I could just quit my job, stay home with Ellie, help Jared pursue his dreams and it all work out, so stupid. Okay, the best thing that you ever did was put Ellie first. She is a spectacular young lady. You should not feel guilty about that. Yeah, but Jared now has to take this stupid corporate job and give up on his dreams. And it is my fault. I'm just scared he's gonna resent me for it. Molly, Jared loves you and the last thing he's ever gonna do is resent you. In fact, he told Todd that you're the one that gave up your dreams to put your family first. [Molly] He said that? Yes, many times to Todd. You are an amazing wife and mother. Well, team, you've done it again. We are this close. The last step will be our trip to New York where we will talk through all the final details and hopefully sign on that dotted line. We've only got 48 hours to get everything prepared, so I will need you to stay here until everything is done. When do you anticipate we'll be needed in New York? Thursday morning with meetings all day Thursday and Friday and a possible onsite meeting on Saturday. Oh, I... Is there a problem, Jared? It's just that it's my daughter's play this weekend and I really... It won't be a problem, Miranda. It'll be fine. Okay, well, let's break for an hour and then meet back here to get started. I will take care of lunch and dinner. Thank you, team. This is our time. What in the world, dude? Ellie's play is this weekend, man. She'll be devastated if I'm not there. I know the play is important and that sucks, but this is your chance. We get this deal, you have financial freedom. You can send her to drama school, she can have it all. I know, I know, I just can't bear the look on her face if I'm not there, man. [Myles] Jared, where are you going? She said we have an hour. I need a minute to think. [Miranda] Hey, Jared, can I talk to you for a second? [Jared] Sure. I wanted to check in with you because I noticed some hesitation back there. I can't have anyone on the team who is not fully committed to what it takes to close this deal. There are plenty of people in this office who are in line for your position. Sorry, it's just that it's my daughter's play this weekend. I was really hoping to make it and I didn't want the meetings to conflict with the schedule. I can't promise you that, Jared. I wish I could, but I can't. I've missed plenty of family events and well, my family, they understand when I pay for all of our family trips and ivy league school. Children understand, Jared. But do they? I don't remember my father at anything. Your dad is one of the most accomplished men in this industry and frankly, I see him as a mentor. When he retired, I vowed to be as good as him. He's one of the reasons that I chose you for this project. Now, if you can't fulfill your duties, I understand, but I need to know now, Jared. I'm not gonna beg you to do this. Okay. I'm the man for the job. Okay. [Jared] Thank you for the opportunity. [Molly] How are you and Todd? Fine, you know, once he figured out that that business wasn't gonna sell for him anyway, he got over it. I feel like it was a little bit more of a blow to his ego than really our bank account, so we'll move on. We shall prevail. I'm so sorry sitting here complaining and you have enough on your plate. It's fine, really. Well, Jared and I will never ever, ever do business with those people again. Good, that's why I love you, Molly. (phone rings) Oh, it's Jared, let me catch this. [Amy] Go ahead. Hey, babe, what's up? [Jared] Hi, sweetheart. Looks like it's gonna be another late night. Again, I am so sorry. I was hoping this wouldn't happen. Yeah, Myles seems to think it's a dream job. I don't even know what my dreams are anymore. Well, your dreams are my dreams, honey. Just do what you gotta do until we figure this out, okay? Thanks, love. I don't know what I'd do without you. [Molly] I'm just doing my part. Now you go do yours. (Myles knocks) Come on, man, we're waiting on you. Be right there. (phone rings) Hello? [Caller] Hello, Jared. Yes? [Caller] We've received your submission. What submission? Who is this? [Caller] It's a rush call for an action-packed scene. Let's just say I'm a freelance talent scout who works with numerous casting directors. We've seen your demo reel. With your experience, we think you'd be perfect to improv with the other actors. It's a great featured shot, a real opportunity for exposure. The first AD, Chas, will fill you in at the details. Just meet at our studios off of Green Street and Simon Avenue. The old West Hills district? How will I know which one's yours? [Caller] You'll know our studio when you see it. Chas will be expecting you at 5 PM. An hour? I don't think I can get there in an hour. I got work to do. [Caller] Like I said, it's a rush call. We're on a tight schedule. Break a leg, Mr. Stevens. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Jared, where are you going? Jared! (dramatic music) [Automated] Hello, no one is available to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. (phone beeps) Molly, hey look, I don't have much time, but I just got a call from a casting agent. I got booked on a role. I don't really know which one. She sounded British or something. The phone call was super rushed. It actually starts tonight. I'm on my way there now. These are your dreams, too, babe. I gotta go. Wish me luck. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Hello? Hi, I'm Jared Stevens. I got a call saying to report here. Are you the lady that called me? Okay. New to the movie industry or something? [Jared] Yeah, can you tell? Yeah, you're the last one here. It's just now 5 o'clock. Yeah, but when you're late, you're a no show. You're on time, that means you're late. But of course, when you're early, then you're on time. I see. What's your deal, day job? I did some acting in college. I just thought I would get back into it. (Terrence laughs) Reliving the glory days, huh? Something like that. Is that the lady that called me? Don't know, she hasn't said a word to me since I got here. I think she's dating the director or something. Hi, I'm Hannah. Jared. Do you know anything about this film or this production company? No, I'm kind of new to the city. I'm working on my master's in film school. Someone in class told me about this opportunity, so of course I jumped at the chance. Resume-building and all that. No, it's not what you think. It's movie-making, kid. You'll see. So will you, father figure. It's nice that you're still into acting and all, that you didn't give up, sell out, move to the 'burbs. Well, I am a suburbanite. Oh. (Hannah laughs) It's cool, Hannah, full of adventure. Your wife lets you do this? Lets me, yeah, she encourages me to do it. We were both in the theater department in college. We loved it, but then we got married and everything changed. But did it? Got kids? Yeah, a daughter, teenager. Ooh. (Hannah laughs) Yeah, she's actually an actress, too. In fact, she should probably be here instead of me. [Hannah] Wish my dad could understand the creative life. What, he's not supportive? No, no, not in the least. Business school, fully paid for by my proud father. Film school, though, not a real profession. "We can't financially encourage that." So of course I jumped at the chance for a paid acting gig. My dad was the same way. And actually that's my biggest fear, you know, is turning into him, being like him, not encouraging my daughter, letting her down. I bet you're a cool dad. And I'm sure you're gonna crush your role today, so break a leg. Thanks, you too. Never give up chasing your dreams, Hannah. Good evening, everyone. I'm Chas, the first AD for this project. Glad you all could book with us. We're shooting a short action sequence for the film, however depending on your improv skills, your performance may land you a major part in the next production. So this is like a rush call audition... Hey, midlife crisis, stop flirting with the talent. Sorry, I was... No time. Look, all I can say is that this is a groundbreaking concept and the payoff can be huge. You won't regret being here. Everyone has a role to play. What will your part be? We need to get to set. I'll explain more on the way, follow me. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) The scene that we're shooting tonight is a diamond heist. The director, the actors and the background talent are already on set. Everyone has a role to play, just play your part and roll with the rest. There'll be numerous mounted cameras on set. This may go without saying, don't look at the cameras. Here are your weapons. Try not to use it. Rubber pistols? [Chas] Safety third. So what exactly do we do? Terrence will take the lead, the rest is up to you. (light music) What are you doing? Figured it's a heist, shouldn't we wear a mask or something? True acting isn't about wearing masks, it's about removing them. Hey, Jess, we're five minutes away, get ready. (light music) (light music) (siren wails) And action! Follow me. (siren wails) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (partygoer laughs) No, not at all. Ladies and gentlemen, nobody move. Well, not even a hello? Tell me to whom we have the honor of meeting. We're here for the diamonds. Humph, of course you are. Well... Jess, cover the door. 9 to 5, you cover the guests. College girl, get the diamonds. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (gun fires) Those are some crazy special effects. That sounds like live ammo. Rubber pistols? Did you even see any cameras? I've got a bad feeling about this. (gun fires) Go! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gunman grunts) (dramatic music) Here, here, here, take the necklace, I'll catch up. Hannah, I don't think that guy's gun's made out of rubber. Wow, you're really selling this. Use that fear, yes! We've gotta get out of here, come on. Go, go, go, go, I'll catch up, go! (siren wails) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) Don't you think it's time to stop playing around and give up on this make-believe? [Jared] Well, maybe someday we can buy our own rocket, fly away into our own sky. Ladies and gentlemen, we're here for the diamonds. This is a groundbreaking concept and the payoff can be huge. Your purpose is to provide fulfillment for your family. (Jared groans) (dramatic music) That's a wrap on Jared. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Where am I? You're at the hospital, sweetie. Sounds like you had quite the adventure, Mr. Stevens. You were shot in the leg, but it's a minor flesh wound. You're very lucky. I must say I'm more concerned about the concussion you sustained from the fall. But rest easy, we'll take very good care of you. Could I speak to you for a moment? (soft music) Mrs. Stevens, this is Detective Stokes. She's working on Jared's case. I saw on the news about this heist. And you don't think your husband knew anything about it. No, he got a phone call that he was booked on an action film or something. He just assumed it was a indie project associated with the film school. He was so excited because we moved here for him to pursue acting and he's been super stressed at work. Did he ever get a name of who called? No, he said she had an accent, British I think. Well, this director plays on the dreams of eager young actors. He booked for mock action scenes that actually turned out to be real robberies. They made off with millions of dollars worth of diamonds. Is Jared in trouble? No, from what we can tell, he had absolutely no knowledge of the scheme. Like all the other actors, he was just a pawn in the game. Thankfully he's okay 'cause it could've been worse. Is he in danger? Doubtful, we've ID'd the guy we think is behind it. He's a disgruntled college professor named Chas Lawrence. Poor guy had a nervous breakdown a few years back. He lost his job, lost his wife after a fling with a British film student. I guess he thought this was his comeback. Did you catch him? His whereabouts are currently unknown. Maybe he fled the country. You never can tell with this guy. Even before the nervous breakdown, he was an oddball, flighty, a bit off the grid. And the diamonds? We believe they're with Chas. Have your husband call me if he has any further information. Thank you, detective. We'll be in touch. (soft music) (dramatic music) The test results came back and his leg is healing quite nicely. He did lose some blood, but there's been no significant damage. So sit tight and we'll have you out of here before you know it. And if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask. [Molly] Thank you. Mm-hm. How could I have been so naive? I let my ambitions get the better of me. Don't worry, sweetie, you were doing what you thought was right. We're behind you cheering you on. What happened to the others? Well, like you, they were all ambitious actors eager to get a shot onscreen. Unfortunately, you were all duped by a con artist. Thankfully, no one was badly hurt. Was it that Chas guy? [Molly] Apparently, he's nowhere to be found. Where's Ellie? Myles took her for ice cream after rehearsals today. And the good news is the doctor says you're gonna be all healed up and out in time for her opening night this weekend. I got you something. I got you these. I love you. (soft music) (phone rings) Molly, is this some sort of joke? You need to answer that call. Hello? [Caller] Hello, Jared. Congratulations on your booking. Keep up the good work.
