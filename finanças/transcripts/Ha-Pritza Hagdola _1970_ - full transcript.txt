when they are sent inside do you understand what i mean oh yes i understand and what do you want from me i want to go to el muzir to take pictures of the life of the most notorious prison middle east and major i want to take pictures of you the most notorious commander el mozier's ever had either you are out of your mind or else you are really laughing at me mister coleman with a k mr coleman with a k you want to take a picture of me where the last time i had my picture taken sir it was from the class photo when i graduated high school is that a fact that is a fact buy or something might interest you major do you recognize this man how the hell did you get this from an old high school friend of yours take a good look major who gave you these israeli intelligence service sent them to

fact that is a fact do you know this man hey you to me yes you me you yes come here quickly show me your papers oh you will never succeed never we will succeed i'm sure you're familiar with this magazine it has over 50 million readers throughout the world i know i work for this magazine now our feature article next month is a pictorial article on el mozier prison your government press bureau has advised me to go to el musia prison to interview the israeli prisoners and to take new pictures to bring things up to date and give it a more let's say an objective point of view do you understand and now major if you'd be so kind would you lift your head and smile what come on take me to his room quick yes sir as oh you are fools if you try don't you understand perhaps no one has ever managed to escape from el museum no one i made it only weed luck and two bullets in your body supreme they are going to pay you more than they paid you for those pictures you make do you do you believe i did it for the money no i don't really understand you saved me the other day in the wadi and they didn't pay you i really don't understand i am a druze so they hate you as much as they hate us and that is not all i have children in israel where in romney we'll take you with us all right come on you are all crazy and i'm even crazier get it each car is checked twice first at the bridge then at the gate and the water tanker yes the tank or two even though it comes in every morning and everyone expects it a jeep with a major and somebody else is on its way to the prison it might be our man ellie come on sit down over there great michael himself is taking him into the prison look that's the signal isn't it take a look that's it they wake up at 5 30 breakfast at six physical training and then work who are they scum of the earth political prisoners spies traders that's amazing major you really have quite a fortress here be very difficult to blow up blow up oh i mean the walls are thick strong they don't make them that way anymore i would say this place was probably built before christ oh it's a very old building even before uh muhammad ahmad mr coleman i just remembered i must go up to my office my sergeant will show you to the cells right when you finish please come to my office i will ahmad go on see you later yes oh by the way major i really don't understand why everyone speaks so badly of you you show me such such courtesy so hello hello yes here we ask for the defense ministry the chief himself all right will you talk with the colonel samuel just a minute please connect me major hello hello michael speaking how are you yes small question does the name coleman mean anything to you coleman a reporter you gave me a letter for me what i see yes that's what i thought something very funny is happening down here you'll hear more about it yes i'll call you sit down is something wrong wait a minute tell me something do you think the israeli intelligence service is composed of idiots and oh oh no no you're full they are clever they are as clever and cunning as devils those israelis look the guy arrives and just about moves the mountain to get in here and then he goes around leaving me messages everywhere that he is in israeli like this shirt with his big made in israel label all these phony passport now tell me jamil if they are not idiots why would they do this why i don't know why to feed me with false information or as they say to confuse the enemy it can't be sir look he's an israeli i know that he's an israeli and he knows that i know that he's an israeli get it i see what you mean that's very clever major yeah come in major what's the matter something important something very urgent that's him are you sure it was him yes sir i'm quite sure ali returns welcome back so they're up to something one is outside and one is already inside i know these two have come to free the full israeli prisoners just the two of them no no my friend i'm willing to bet that several more of them are in the area we've got to catch them major of course we've got to catch them but let's use our brains brains jamil i want them all maybe there are 20 maybe a hundred a hundred why are they hiding they are not stupid they've got a plan carefully thought out why don't we ask the army to help no we shall take care of them on our own i don't want any bloody staff officer from our headquarters collecting medals at my expense let them be a hundred let them be more we'll take care of them on our own you know i've got a feeling i may be meeting an old acquaintance of mine who someone who i've been waiting for for a long time he spent two years here and he promised that he'd come back to settle the score do you mean the tall israeli i know who you mean what was his name dana do you remember him do you think he's one of them just the feeling they want to break in here they are welcome they are all welcome to come in to come in but not to go out that's very clever major to come in but not to go out unless they leave in coffins enough lieutenant yes sir go find that reporter and have him meet the israelis you know in which room yes sir leave him there alone and report back to me let him talk to them alone you heard me alone yes sir let's go i'm an american journalist i'm here to ask you some questions and i would like to have them answered truthfully okay what do you want to know everything i ask you okay only if you get rid of these two is that possible five minutes cigarette thanks hmm all right how long you been in solitary confinement three months hmm how about the food sweet or salted tea dry bread twice a day what's the matter with him he won't talk he hasn't said a word for three months they broke him and he tried to commit suicide since then he's he's been sort of strange he needs urgent treatment he'll get it sooner than you think now tell me about the water situation there isn't any here the wells are dried up they bring the water from farid every morning in a tanker in a tanker yes early at four o'clock in the morning you mean that a water tanker goes in and out of the prison every morning yes at four o'clock i don't understand keep quiet gather around i have something very important to tell you about we have a plan who are you my name is abraham but that's not important i bring a regard from colonel udi from beno and from your friend ellie ellie yes where is he he's all right you'll see him soon enough now let me tell you about the plan be careful they're listening up there all right listen carefully we're going to break through tomorrow night to get you four out of here what time midnight uh-huh you know where to find us in the solitary cells yes and the lost ones don't worry we'll find you see you tomorrow night hey may i have that cigarette now this should give back to me tomorrow night hey we've gone home soon come in come in have you got the transcription yes sir are you sure he said midnight yes sir well i dismissed i learned the prophet i don't understand he must have realized we were listening to him so you're beginning to catch on and they have a different plan he was trying to mislead us yes but if it isn't midnight it can't be done because they have to go 30 miles to get back to israel which means they would have to walk all that way in broad daylight and why not the israelis always attack at dawn remember at dawn hey wait a minute where is he now photographing in the yard come on let's go yes thank you for such an ambitious man you're very naive jamie so you think they wouldn't attack captain then why would he care about the time the water arrives and how in the tank the only vehicle that enters without any problems every morning i salute you mr coleman beautiful plan you son of a [ __ ] well mr coleman are you pleased yes major i am pleased very pleased frankly i'm impressed i had no idea your prison would be like this and major i can't
