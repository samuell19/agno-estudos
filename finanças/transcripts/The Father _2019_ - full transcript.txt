Where is the pleasure in life which is unmixed with sorrow? Where the glory which on earth has stood firm and unchanged? All things are weaker than shadow, all more illusive than dreams. Comes one fell stroke, and Death prevails over all these vanities. Wherefore in the Light, O Christ, of Your countenance, To her whom You have chosen grant repose, for You are the Friend of Mankind. What an agony the soul endures when from the body it is parting! How many are her tears for weeping, but none that will show compassion. Unto the angels she turns; Useless are her supplications. Unto men she extends her imploring hands, but none bring her rescue. My beloved brethren, let us all ponder well how brief is the span of our life. And peaceful rest for her that now is gone, let us ask of Christ, and also His abundant mercy for our souls. Vanity are all the works and quests of man. How can our glory go with us? For when death has come, all these things are vanished clean away. Wherefore to Christ the Immortal King let us cry, "To her that has departed grant repose where a home is prepared" "for all those whose hearts You have filled with gladness." Where is now our affection for earthly things? Where is now our gold, and our silver? Where is now the surging crowd of domestics, and their busy cries? All is dust, all is ashes, all is shadow. Wherefore draw near that we may cry to our immortal King: "Your everlasting blessings vouchsafe unto her that now has gone away," "bringing her to repose in that blessedness which never grows old." Which is he that is king? Or which is soldier? Which is the wealthy, which the needy? Which the righteous, or which the sinner? But to Your servant, O Lord, grant that with the righteous she may repose. My beginning and foundation was the form; Bestowing Word of Your commandment; For it pleased You to make me by compounding visible and invisible nature into a living thing. Out of earth was my body formed and made, but a soul You gave me by the Divine and Life-creating in breathing. Wherefore, O Christ, to Your servant in the land of the living, in the courts of the righteous, do You grant repose. Do you have your camera with you? - Yes, why? - Hold on, wait! Put away the lid. Take a photo of her. - Dad, she has so many fine photos. - Take her photo! Please. Does anyone have a camera? Alright, fine. - Close it. - Just one? It's enough. - Well, take a few more. - That's not necessary. - Give it to me! - Hang on! Get away from there. - Come on, that's enough. - Print them for me, yeah? Carry on. - I apologize. Sorry. - That's alright. Leave it. Your mother loved lemonade so much. My dear boy. Poor thing, those doctors, how they messed her up... Went in for a cyst and look how she came back. Poor thing. So young, couldn't even live to see some grandkids. And she wanted it so much. Forgive me, I have to make an urgent call. Where are you going now? - Where to? - I'll be right back. Pavka, please find that picture of your mother from the TV show. - OK, in a minute. - Just hurry up, yeah? Honey, how are you? Why haven't you been picking up all day? I just didn't have the chance. We're having lunch now, that's why I'm picking up. Tell me how you are, everything OK? Yes, I just wanted to read you something, but whatever. - Hello? - I'll be right there. I have to go, the director's calling me. - But you said you're on a lunch break. - I can't ignore him, you know that. - Fine. I'll call you later. - OK. Bye. Kisses. My idea is to draw the material and the spiritual world as a mirror. Pavka, find that picture, will you, I need it. Down here I will draw Valia, the way I last saw her at the graveyard. And up here, in the light, I'll draw her the way I saw her for the first time, pretty like an angel. No, the slice is perfect, leave it like this. Just enhance the black, but careful not to dull it, yeah? Pavka, leave that damn phone, will you! For fuck's sake, you have no respect at all! I'm sorry. This will be a portrait of her soul. In this photo that Pavel will show you, she's wearing a budenovka, holding a gun, but I will draw her with a halo and a baby in her arms, as the Virgin and Child. And the connection between the two portraits will be a spiral, whereupon the astral body ascends to the Beyond. - Go on, break your neck. - Holy Mother! Break your neck so that we can bury you too! - I'm fine. - You'll be the death of me. - Where was I? - The spiral. The spiral, whereupon the astral body ascends to the Beyond. By the way, I don't know if you know, but the scientists still cannot explain the phenomenon of instrumental trans-communication. Because a person's consciousness doesn't vanish after their death, but is preserved in a global energy-informational field. Also, I don't know if you know, but DNA itself has the shape of a spiral. - And as a juxtaposition... - Here. On this side I will draw The Big Bang. - Here. - Vasko, you speak so nicely. - You're just like Ruvi. - Who? What do you mean? Doctor Ruvi. Haven't you been to see him? - I don't go to doctors. - Wait, wait. What about blood pressure, does he cure blood pressure? He cures everything, not only blood pressure. Here. Doctor Ruvi is not a medic. He is an energy leader, a channeler with incredible skills and you should go see him by all means. - We'll see about that. - But I've been to him! It just came back to me as I saw the flyer. Some time ago, my colleague's mother had passed away and we were on business in the area. We were measuring the low-frequency radio waves. And she asked me to go with her for support. And he really contacted her mother. - Bullshit. - It's not bullshit, Gosho! - Don't make me laugh. - He doesn't believe in such things. He's a staunch communist. I've seen so many communists at Ruvi's. The Governor of Yambol, also a very renowned member of Parliament, Deputy-Minister of the Exterior... What was his name? - Blagoy Denchev. - Yes. - But I don't think he is a communist. - He's not. Many famous people go to Ruvi. I didn't get one thing. Why does he speak in different languages? Because, Tanya, he manages to access various channels, where he receives messages in various languages. There have been cases where during a single seance he's delivered messages in five languages. And the fact that your friend's mother is Bulgarian has nothing to do with the language in which her spirit speaks. It all depends on the vibrations' frequency. - Yes, and on the torsion fields. - Absolutely, yes. By the way, Soviet academician Anatoliy Akimov proves that the speed of the torsion fields is over one billion times higher than the speed of light. Why, isn't this our Valia in "The Dawn of the New Day" TV show? How did you manage to find it? Pavel searched for half an hour, tore down half the library and couldn't find it. - That's what I'm talking about. - "The Dawn of the New Day", yes. How did the song from the show go? The comrade bravely marches Through fire on to his death. Even if he perishes in the fight, He'll go with his duty fulfilled. Soon the hour will strike! Are you very tired? Kind of. What is this stupid ad anyway? Some wine. And how much will they pay you? How much? - A thousand. - A thousand? You should have asked for double that if it is so urgent and they want you to dance to their tune. They have to pay up. They should give you a box of wine at the very least. Hello? - Did you have dinner? - Yes, I did. But I feel like something sweet. Well, have some of those chocolates in the fridge. No, I don't feel like chocolate. I feel like... You know what I feel like? Quince jam. - Quince jam? - Yes, quince jam. Please, get me some! Think the power went out. Jeez. God knows what shithole of a hotel they put you in. If you bring home fleas, I'll kill you. Crap, these chocolates are horrible. OK. I'll buy you some jam on my way back. But not from a store, I want homemade. With geranium. And where would I find that? You're shooting in a village, right? Have one of the assistants ask the local grannies. Alright. I'll figure something out. Hello? I'll call you back, someone's knocking on my door. - Fine. - Bye. Good night. Why have you locked yourself in? - I haven't. - You haven't, but it was locked. Your door handle is broken on the outside. You can come to my room, if you don't wanna be alone. - No, I'm fine. - Come on. No need to play the hero now. It's warmer in my room. Did you hear that? What? Somebody's walking in the other room. It's the wind. No, those are your mother's footsteps. Bullshit. The window just slammed because of the wind. I know your mother's steps very well. There it is again! Dad? Are you OK? What happened? You mother's favorite vase. Don't worry, we'll fix it in the morning. No. Pavka, it broke by itself! I didn't even touch it. I was standing over here and suddenly it burst into pieces. Ok. Let's go to bed. Pavka, there's something I didn't tell you. Your mother and I had a phone call just before the surgery, and she said "I have something important to tell you". But then my phone... The battery died, I couldn't charge it... And in the afternoon they told me she had passed away. And now the whole time I'm thinking what's that important thing that your mother needed to tell me. - Look what time it is. - I don't care. - Come, you need to get some sleep. - No, no. This question just won't leave me alone. - What question? - What your mother wanted to tell me. Dad... Boy, if this isn't a miracle! This is just incredible! - Yes, the miracle of electricity. - No, this, this, look! - I don't have my glasses. - It's a "V"! "V" as in Valia! As in "vibration", as in "very important", get it? Yes, as in Vasil, violin, various reasons why a vase could fall. Pavka. Another "V". In Cyrillic. - Tomorrow you'll figure it all out... - No, no! Please! Leave them as they were, I want to see the full mosaic! Don't you understand that your mother is trying to tell me something? Alright. Let's do it like this. We let the full mosaic lie here, as it is, and we go to bed. Dad? I'll be on my way now. Dad? "Search for the answer..." - Dad, I'm saying I'll... - Help! Sweet Mother! Open up! - Aunt Lyubka, calm down! - Pavka, did you lock up? No, it's your shitty door handles. Stay calm, aunt Lyubka, we just... Lyubka, what happened? Valia is calling me on the phone! And what did she say?! I didn't pick up! How could you not pick up, you stupid cow! - She's calling me to the Beyond! - Where's your phone? - Where is it! - Let her go. Easy, easy! Lyubka, did you remember where you left your phone? Lyubka, if you can hear me, squeeze my hand. Dad, let them do their job! Lyubka, where did you drop your phone? Sir, please! - Doc, if she comes to... - Sir, please close the door! Cut it out already. No. Here. No one has been calling you. She's playing some tricks on me, that's it. I'm sure of it. We had a quarrel and now, knowing her... It's not the first time, she's playing tricks on me even from the grave! Dad, look. - Dad, listen. - What? Leave this and listen carefully! The dead cannot call the living on the phone. And what about the Chicago case? What case? Which planet do you live on? Don't you watch TV? In 1997 the Chicago Airport flight dispatch received a radio transmission from a plane which took off from Munich in 1947. The pilots were requesting permission to land! What do you make of that, Pavka? It was all over TV. - So, did it land? - Of course it did! Did it land... In Lyubka's backyard. It's impossible to talk to you sensibly. - Things got complicated. - What do they want this time? They rejected the ad, they said the chutney felt too bluish. OK. Send them a greenish version, a colder one, a yellowish version and also our version again, and let's see which one they pick. And if there's still a problem, call me right away. So long. Dad, look. I need to go, I can't stay any longer. Dad? Dad! You fucking... Dad, where do you think you're going? Pavka, get out of the way, I'm in a hurry. You've been drinking, you can't drive like this! - Your mother will watch over me. - Step out of the car. I'm not moving. What's going on? You didn't call last night. Sorry, I was beat and fell asleep right away. Sure, you need your sleep, don't worry. - Are you travelling? - Yeah, back there. What do you mean back there? Well, what can I say. That's why they came knocking last night. The hard drive with the entire footage got burnt and now we're on our way back for a reshoot. Jesus! You're working with morons! That's what I told them. How are your trainers, by the way? - Sorry, what? - The trainers I bought for you. They're great. Very soft. Like slippers. See? I was right... - And what about my request? - Which request? The jam. Have you forgotten? How could I forget? I haven't forgotten. Did you find home-made jam? - Yes, I did. - With geranium? With geranium, sure. You're the sweetest creature, and I'm having such a strong craving for it, I just can't take it anymore. - Someone's at the door, sorry. - Hello? Did she hang up on you? No, no, the connection dropped. I don't want to meddle, but not coming to your mother's funeral... She wanted to, but I didn't let her. It's just not the right time. It is never the right time for a funeral. Put your seatbelt on. If she loved you and cared for you, she would have come. What's going on? I forgot my shoes. We're going back. We're not going back, we can't go back! Dad, look at my foot ware. That doesn't matter, he is open until 2 o'clock. You have reached your destination. Your destination is on the right. No way it's here. It's here, dad. Look, it says here. The former Museum of National Revolt. Good afternoon! - Is this Rudi's place? - Yes, yes, this is it. Excuse me, do you have any quince jam? No, I have fig jam, apricot jam. No, no. Thanks. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. Your father's asking you to come in. Pavka, give me 120 levs. - How much? - 120 levs. No way I'm giving some crook 120 levs. Let's get out of here. Pavka, let's not make a fuss, give me 120 levs. Are you crazy to give them 120 levs? Have you no shame? You still owe your mother 200 levs. Excuse me? Don't play dumb. Your mom died with her eyes open because of this money. Hang on, dad, what are you talking about, what's this nonsense? Don't you remember, you cast her in that meat commercial, you promised she'd have a role, and then we only saw her hands? And you promised her 200 levs which you never gave her. Remember? You didn't send the money, though you said you would, and she, poor thing, was afraid to ask and. Pavka, it's not that we don't have money... You know very well that we have money. She just wanted to go out on the street and say: "This money I earned with my profession." Old man, my mother gave up her profession because of you. And that was more than 30 years ago. Your mother gave it up because of you, when you were born! Because you wouldn't help her out. - Me?! - Yes, you. I kept you both like the apple of my eye! Don't you remember?! Show me one painter, a single one, who could have provided you with the type of living standard that I provided you with! The others had their whole families crammed into single-room flats! That wasn't your achievement, it was my grandfather who made sure you win that mural commission in Dimitrovgrad. And then they awarded you the honorary title, they gave you a three-room apartment with an atelier on top. And all of this thanks to my grandpa, whom you didn't want to look in the eye because he was a communist. I'm a dissident. I don't want anything to do with the communists! A dissident with a party member ID in his pocket. I threw my party ID at the Artist Union Chairman's face in '74! I nearly got locked up! Yeah, thanks to grandpa for getting you off the hook. Why are you acting like this? Because of some measly 120 levs? Here, take as much as you need, take the whole wallet, take it. I don't need your wallet, I need 120. And you know very well I'll pay you back. I'm so sorry. Here you are. - Hello? - Sorry to bother you. - But things got quite heated. - Why? They rejected the spot again. That wasn't their chutney. OK, I'm back tonight and I'll come straight to the studio. They want the revisions done by tomorrow morning. - OK, don't worry, it's fine. - OK. Bye. Hurry up, cause I need to be in Sofia urgently. I'm staying. What do you mean? My aura is too heavy and the fine matter won't pass through it. I need to sleep over, cleanse myself and then come back tomorrow. I gotta be at color grading tonight. Besides, I need stop by the house and take my shoes. OK, Pavka, do what you have to, take the car, I'll take the bus back tomorrow, no problem. See you. Dad, wait! Here, take this for the bus and for some dinner. - And this is for the hotel. - I won't need a hotel. Where will you stay? In the woods. Hold on. What woods? Pavka, this is where those meteorites fell during the Jurassic period. I gotta sleep next to one of those meteorites and tell Ruvi my dream in the morning. This way, when he enters the global energy-information field, he will easily locate your mother's aura. Father, please, you can't sleep in the woods alone. I'm a grown man, what's the problem? Father, stop making a fool of yourself. Hang on, stop. You can't even sleep alone at home and you want to sleep in the woods?! - Are you headed to the meteorites? - Yes. See you. Dad! Pavka, please, stop being a smart ass. Do you at least have your phone with you? - Hello? - Hello, honey, how are you? - I'm sorry, did I wake you up? - Yes. I only wanted to tell you we're done and on the way home. I just need to stop by the studio first, I won't be long. Right, can I just read you something? OK, go ahead, I'm listening. Listen: "Three black-eyed women with long dark hair." "The oldest one, the middle one, the youngest one." "Naked, lying on each other voluptuously." "And the Queen's bottom is made out of dough." "He smiles dreamily." "Did I hold his hand?" "I think we are already in Japan." "Well done. Better done. Am I somehow to blame?" Well, it's good. - Not good, it's great. - You like it? Yes, I like it very much. I'm only not sure if it shouldn't rather be: "Well done. Am I somehow to blame?" - Well, the first one. - No, no, I don't think so. I think it should end with... "Am I somehow to blame?" The first one is no good, yes. Gimme the second one. "I think we are already in Japan. Am I somehow to blame?" - Yes, this one, that's it. - Really? Of course. Much better. OK. Go to bed now and think of a new one. - Bye. Kisses. - Night. Dad? I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Dad ! Dad! Can't you call up some search teams with dogs or something? The person has to be missing for at least 72 hours, which means you go home, wait for him and if he doesn't show up within 2-3 days, you come back. No, I can't believe it. So, what, you'll do nothing about it? I'm telling you my father is alone somewhere out there and I'm here to ask the police for help! Excuse me! Shame on you! And have you checked this Ruvi? He's a crook! He lures old people to give him their money and he sends them to sleep in the woods. Alone at night! How can this be? I guess then he kidnaps them and forces them to sign over their property. - Would you like to file a complaint? - Of course I would like to! Write. - Write what? - Everything. You mean all that I've been telling you for half an hour? - Yes. - And you've been taking notes? I need it written in your own hand. Man, can you make something out of this? It's some new stuff. Is this winning or what? You got nothing, brother. Want a slice? No. - Coffee? - Yeah, I guess. Excuse me, is that quince jam? Is that quince jam? With geranium? With geranium, yes. And did you buy it in the area? - I make it myself. Why? - Home-made. And do you, by any chance, have some extra jars? I do, yes. Could I buy one from you? Is this the marketplace or what? Keep writing and stop bothering my colleague. Let's step out for a smoke. Keep writing. What are you doing? What are you doing, dumb ass? Why are you rummaging in my desk? - Hey, mate! - I'll just clean it up. What are you doing? Stop it now! Stop! Mate! - I'm sorry! - Sit down. What's going on here? I wanted to take just a little bit for my wife. She's going through a tough pregnancy and she said she had a craving for this kind of jam. I'm trying to be considerate and I don't want to trouble her. I haven't even told her that my mother passed away. And then my father went out looking for her... Not my wife, my mom. She had something to tell him, but he didn't pick up the phone... And he went missing, and I'm looking for him. And I'm really worried for my wife. And for my father, of course. - What the hell are you doing? - It will be sticky otherwise. Come and sit here. Leave this and sit here. Let me just take my... Here's your spoon. I'm very sorry. I'll just go now, I honestly have so much to do. Wait, wait, sit down. My father is in the woods, I really need to help him. I don't know about your father's problems in the woods, but you're in for some problems tonight. I won't be filing any complaints anymore. Make sure all your personal belongings are here. Kalina - 10 missed calls Toshko Color - 4 missed calls Good morning. Did you sleep well? - How are you? - I'm good. Not too good, though. We spent the whole night in the studio, I am totally beat. - The whole night where? - In the studio, where else? - In the studio. The whole night. - Yes. And where are you right now? I'm just walking out of the studio. I'm out front, and I'm heading to... You are walking out of the studio? Right now? Yes. - I just walked out of the... - You are not in the studio. I am in the studio. What are you doing in the studio? - Why bother to go there? - Don't do this to me, please. We made a promise. I completely get it. - What do you get? - Don't do this. We made a promise! Hang on a minute. What are you even talking about? It's all clear to me. We promised to never lie to each other, never ever! Honey, please, calm down. I want you now, with Todor as a witness, to confess to me that there's another woman! I know I'm terrible and unbearable and fat! You're not, you look amazing, please, don't! It is not what you're thinking at all! I don't want you to lie to me! Wait, hello? Just relax, breathe! Hello? Please leave a message... - Hello? - What's going on with you, man? Hello, Tosho? Please, is she there, is she with you? - Yeah, she's here. - Is she OK? - Yeah, I guess. - Give her something, will you. Sprinkle her with water. Please, just calm down. How can I calm down when you're lying to me? I can't calm down. I want to know what's happening! Tell me! Want me to tell you what's happening? Yes, tell me what's happening! I was arrested by some cops, that's it. What? Because I borrowed a production car to get home to you faster and the crew guys decided to put all the shooting equipment in it and then those cops stopped me for a check. And they made a big deal over why I got no documents for the equipment, and they said I stole it. - No way. For real? - Yes. They said they had a procedure. I should have told you from the start, I just didn't want to upset you. That's why I called my father because the police station is very close to my parents' place and I called him and he'll be here to get me any moment now. Dad! Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry to bother you. Have you seen an old man with a beard and... Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad? Dad? Dad! Are you OK? Come now. Pavka, you woke me up at the best part. OK, come now. Wait. I need to finish my dream. Look at me now. Are you OK? Can you see that? How many fingers? Give it here. - Why are you undressing me? - I'm dressing you. - Why? - Because you're naked. Steady, steady. Can you see what's on my back, Pavka, over here? - What's that rash? - I don't know. Last night... Last night I was lying down next to that meteor on something very soft. - You've been lying on an ant hill. - Right, and then... I think I tripped. Come on, give me your foot. - Your right foot. - I tripped and then... Your mother and I... - Your mother and I started walking. - Give me the other one. This one. - Where were we going? - Give it. Pavka, wait, I remember where we were going, wait. - Wait, Dad. - No, Pavka, I got it. Easy now. Give me my shoes. Look how you're dressing me! What are you trying to do? Give me my shoes! - Dad, let me do it, please. - No, don't torture me. Don't torture me, I gotta go. Easy now. Please, be careful. Pavka, I'm late, don't you get it? - What are you late for now? - For Rudi! You can't go to Ruvi like this. You'll scare him. - Why? - There's blood all over you. We'll go see a doctor first. I'm not seeing any doctor. I'll piss on it and it'll pass. How will you piss on your head? Here's for two pairs. - Is everything fine? - Yes, everything's fine. Did they let you go? Yeah, I'm just waiting for the officer to finish his report. - Is your father with you? - My father's with me, yes. - Say hi to him. - Yeah, I will. He says hi too. - Call me when they let you go. - OK, go to sleep now. Your father is going through severe post-traumatic shock. In his state, it is for his own good, and for the good of those around him that he is temporarily hospitalized. Under psychiatric care. What's his name again? Vassil Angelov. Now, sign the form, please. This is to confirm that you agree that your father will be hospitalized. Name, surname, signature. His insurance is in order, right? Well... He's retired. Well, that's even better. Lovely. That means his treatment won't cost you a dime. All you need to pay for is the bed, 12 levs per day. And of course, for some sanitary essentials. At least one set of bed sheets, has to be new, unopened. And when will you discharge him? The standard procedure is a few days. A week at the most. But every case is individual. Now, of course, if you would like to help the hospital somehow, we can prolong his stay to a month, even two. - No. - Don't worry. This is just on paper. Did you sign it? - Where do I sign? - Here. Authorized person. - Name, surname and signature? -Yes, yes. - Or only a signature? - Name, surname, signature. Can I talk to my father first? Of course. Dad, you'll have to stay here under observation for a few days. In the looney bin? Yeah, you've left me no other option. You've been acting like a lunatic for two days now. Dad, I want you to promise me now that you'll cut the crap, and we'll go home. OK. No more Ruvi and spiritual seances. I promise. No messages from the Beyond or any other bullshit. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. OK, let's go. Hold on, where are you going? My father is feeling much better now. Did you talk to the doctor? Yes, it's been settled, don't worry. You didn't get a referral and you must pay for the check-up! The check-up, the injection, the bandage! How much? 35 levs for examination and consultation, 50 levs for the manipulation. Here's 90 levs, buy yourself a treat with the change. Your father shouldn't be left alone in his condition! Don't give this money to me, pay it at the register! You'll have to learn to live without mom, that's the way it is. You'll have to learn to cook on your own too. I can show you how to cook mish-mash. It's very easy. You take whatever vegetables you have, chop them up, not too small. You put them in a pan. You heat up some oil first... Pavka, pull over at that bistro, listening to you made me hungry. What, here? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Three kebapches, two slices of toast. - Hot chilies? - No. - None? - No. A cabbage salad. And a bottle of water. For you? - Are those kebapches big? - Medium. Two for me and a side dish. That's it. - Something to drink? - Water for me as well. Excuse me. - The toilet? - Right across. Thanks. Thanks. - What? - This cheese is terrible. - Did you even try it? - I did. - So what's wrong with it? - I don't like it. It tastes bad. Excuse me, is this actual cheese or some substitute? Mom? Is this cheese real or some substitute? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? Is it plant based, is it cow milk? - What's the difference? - I don't like it. I want to know what I'm eating. - I can't say. - And who can tell me? - How can I find out? - Come on now... I'll eat it if you won't, what's the big deal. - Anything else? - Nothing else! - Let's eat something at least. - No. Here. What's wrong? Would you please check if we blew a tire? - We didn't. - Go on, check it. No! Dad! Are you OK? Dad, wait! Wait a second, man, stop! Wait, damn it, you might have something broken! Stop, I tell you! Stop! Have you lost your mind, man? Stop, I tell you! Fucking stop! What are you doing, you wacko?! Dad! Go, go, go! Giddy-up! I'm sorry! Please, take your pumpkins! I'm sorry! Sorry, we'll return them to you! Vassil? You know the procedure, shoes off. What's up? Dad? I forgot my dream. Fuck this fucking shit! Dad, let's go now. I'm sick of your shit, you hear me?! I'll drag you by force, if I have to! I have my life too, I have my problems, I have my family! What kind of family do you have? She can't even give you a child. Get away! Get away! Comrade, allow me to go! I know where the telephone is. I'm not in danger. Nobody has seen me. They will not recognize me. I doubt there are any fascists up there. They're still at headquarters. Comrades, look how brave and selfless our young comrade is! Here, take this Luger, just in case. Hello? Comrades, do you read me? Hey, you on the other side! Do you read me? I have something important to tell you! Hello? Hello, comrade! Can you hear me? I have an important message for you! I'm on the other side of... The comrade bravely marches through the fire towards the enemy. Even if he perishes in the fight, He will have fulfilled his duty! Soon the hour will strike! A suppressed people will rise! Out of the deathly darkness the dawn of the new day will rise! The dawn of the new day! We have not the slightest doubt, sickle and hammer in hand, That our blood is the reddest of red, just like the flame in our hearts! Who is it? Aunt Lyubka, it's me, Pavka. Pavka, my lad, I thought you'd left. Well, not yet. Sorry for bothering you. That's fine, my lad, come on in. - How are you? - I'm fine. Come on in. They discharged you from the hospital? They discharged me alright, but they got me full of sedatives, I don't know where my mind is. Come in, will you! No, no need, I just wanted to ask you... Did you find your phone? I have to watch my blood pressure. - Don't get emotional. - It's in the drawer, I turned it off. - So you found it? - I don't want anything to do with it. - It's in the drawer. - This one here? Yes. She hasn't stopped calling me, you know! - There she goes again! - Wait, this is a voicemail. It's from the 27th. Before my mother died. She just couldn't reach you and she left a voicemail. - Would you like to hear it? - No, no, no. You take it, if you want to hear it. I don't. - So, I may hear it? - Yes, yes. Turn it off before you bring it back. Well? Did you find out what mom wanted to tell you? Nothing. Hello, Lyubka! Why can't I reach anyone anymore? Please tell Vassil to make the jam from the quinces before they go rotten. He's not answering my ca... Play it again. Hello, Lyubka! Why can't I reach anyone anymore? Please tell Vassil to make the jam from the quinces before they go rotten. He's not answering my ca... Play it again. Hello, Lyubka! Why can't I reach anyone anymore? Please tell Vassil to make the jam from the quinces before they go rotten. He's not answering my ca... I killed your mother. - Dad... - She called me from the hospital. Just before the surgery. And she said: "Vasko, I have something important to tell you". But I was just looking for my aerograph and I told her: "This important stuff can wait, you tell me where you put my aerograph." She got mad, she said: "Instead of asking how I am," "you're only thinking about yourself and your own stuff." So we had a fight. She said: "If I'm gone, how are you gonna get by?" And I lost it, and I smashed the damn phone into the ground. And I told her... "I hope you die then!" I have something to... - Sorry. - Go on, pick it up. - Pick up. - No, I'm not picking up. Keep cutting then. I'm going to be a father.
