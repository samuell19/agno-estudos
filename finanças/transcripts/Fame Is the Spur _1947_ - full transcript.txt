"Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise." "That last infirmity of noble mind." "To scorn delights and live laborious days." Come on, Mrs Hannaway. The buzzer will be going before you get your stays on. Up you get, Georgie lad. Tommy Rowbottom. It's just past five. You up, Mrs Radshaw? Time is getting on. Hello. Hello, son. What are you awake for? You go to sleep. Dad. I am off now. It's all ready. Just put the kettle on. - Alright. See he has his breakfast properly. It's a nasty morning. Get him off to school in good time. He was late yesterday. Don't you worry. I'll see to him. I wish I could go for you on a morning like this. Well, you can't. So you stay where you are. Well, goodbye son. Mind you come straight home from school this evening. And you and Arnold keep away from that Tom Hannaway. Alright, mum. Goodbye. Hey, you two. Keep away from them rats. Them rats are valuable. Leave it down there. Junk. No good to nobody. Not worth taking away. What do you think a lot like that is worth? Two rats please. What, two rats? You're barmy. Here. Take this and think yourself lucky. It's worth more than one. Look at that board. My decision is final, see. You get a buck for that. And if you bring me the rest of it I've a nice doe here. Do you want it? - Alright. That's the idea. That's a good idea. Get a buck and a doe and breed your own. A very good idea. I can't have every kid breeding his own. Where should I be? - But you said you'd give him a doe. That's what you thought I said, Arnold Ryerson. But the price of one end of a bed is a buck. So the price of the other end is a buck. That's sense, isn't it? I wish I had a rat. You do, eh? Well, you get away over there. Not too far away. Where I can call you. Then when I get someone here. I'll call to you and say: 'You was here and saw me buy this'. Whatever it is. What did I pay for it? Then you look down at my hand. And if I hold up my thumb like this. You say sixpence. Two fingers. You say a shilling. And so on. See? But we don't know what you gave for it. What's that matter, Arnold? This is business. Here. There you are. The loveliest buck I've got. But that's cheating. How about it? You want a rat, don't you? Come on, Hamer. You don't really want it. Your mother will never let you keep it anyway. That's right. You go home to your mother, Hamer Radshaw. You ninny. And don't you come back again, Arnold Ryerson. Or I'll kick your teeth down your throat. Then you go home. And what do you find when you get there? Five or six of you in a room that's only just comfortable enough for two. You can't afford more. And why can't you? Because you've got to pay rent to somebody. To Mr Jones or Mr Smith. But he doesn't get the rent, my friends. Oh no. He is just the agent for the Right Honourable the Earl of Lostwithiel. And does His Lordship work in the mill town? Does His Lordship have to sleep five in a room? No. His Lordship lives in luxury on the rents you pay him. The few poor shillings you earn by the sweat of your brow. My friends. Our forefathers had a cry. 'Bread and liberty'. That's all they asked for. Bread and liberty. We've a sword in our house. All about that. Shut up. I want to hear. We're not the first to have to put up this fight. This fight has gone on for hundreds of years. He shouted and banged his hands like this. And all the people shouted. He held up his hand and they were quiet. He told them to sing and they all sang. He could make them do anything. That will have been Sam Bamford. Sam Bamford? No. It wouldn't Sam. Sam Bamford has been dead forty years so it wouldn't be him. Then who could it be? There's plenty about with the gift of the gab and don't care what they say. It's not so rare. Well, he said 'bread and liberty'. Just like Grandpa's man. - Bread and liberty. Grandpa. Tell us about the sabre. - Sabre? You heard what your mother said. Sam Bamford. Dead forty years. Go on, grandpa. Tell it. Tell it yourself. I reckon you pretty near could. 1819 it was. And the battle of Waterloo was four years before it. I was a fine big lad then. Emma... Emma. Emma and me. Both worked in the same mill. But we didn't go to work that day. Nobody did. It was like a holiday. With everybody in their best clothes. Singing and a band playing. And there was Sam Bamford. With green leaves in his hat. And he says to me... 'Come on lad'. 'You two make a handsome pair to march at the head of the column'. I said, 'what's it all about, Sam'? 'You'll see soon enough', he said. 'It's about bread and about liberty'. 'We're going to march into Manchester'. 'And it's all got to be orderly and respectable and no-nonsense'. I never saw anything like it. The number of people. Poor Emma was tired when we got there. And there were so many of us we couldn't move. If only we had known. If only I had thought. Then it came at us like mad. I said to Emma, 'get behind me, love and hold on to my coat'. And I started to push my way through. And then I saw him on his grey horse. With his sabre all bloody. I couldn't believe it. I saw the people begin to fall. And I shouted to him. 'What are you doing, you crazy fool'? 'You're a poor man like us, aren't you'? Then he was on us. I saw the sweep of the sabre. And he was gone. When I got up and turned to Emma. She was dead. I went in search of that dragoon. I found him. Bearing into the crowd. With his sabre lifted to kill again. The sabre fell from his hand. And I picked it up and carried it off and hid it. And kept it all through the years. There it is then, young fellow. A sabre from Peterloo. Waterloo. 1815. Maybe Bonaparte. Peterloo. 1819. When harmless people were... Mind you. I could never quite see what Sam Bamford and them was after. But it weren't no harm. And they didn't ought to have killed people like that. Maybe, when you are older. You will see what it means. Better than I ever did. Waterloo. 1815. Peterloo. 18... 1819. Good lad. Dad. For goodness sake don't handle that darned blooming old thing. Now come on, son. Why not go upstairs and read your book? Bread and liberty. Hamer. Hamer. Yes, Mr Suddaby? Hamer. Where did we put that volume of Owen Meredith? I brought it back here, Mr Suddaby. Thank you. There you are, sir. Thank you. - Thank you. What are you on to now, Hamer? Rousseau. Poor old Jean-Jacques. You can manage that in the French? Oh, yes sir. Your French has been coming on very fast. I've been getting up at six and doing two hours before breakfast at it. What are you going to do with it all? What do you mean, Mr Suddaby? Well, how old are you? In your twenties? You've been here five years. That's alright. Not too much to do in the shop and all the books you want. I pay you ten shillings a week and maybe one day it will be fifteen shillings. But you've got a long way to go, Hamer. And you can't get far in a second-hand bookshop. I want to learn my job. What job, lad? The job I have got to do. To make things fairer. To get rid of all this poverty and dirt and... Well, to talk to people and make them see that... All this has to be changed. Everyone must have enough to eat. You're going to put the world right, eh? I'm going to try. That's not a bad thing to do when you're young. You might even make a living at it. Some do. But not everything you have to learn for that comes out of books. Here comes your pupil. Good afternoon, Miss Artingstone. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr Radshaw. Good afternoon, Miss Artingstone. What revolutionary stuff has he been giving you now? 'A Students introduction to Karl Marx'. I don't know what your father would say. - Neither do I. Luckily, daddy doesn't read much. If Hamer turns you into a radical... I disclaim all responsibility. Well, have you read it? Yes. At least... - All of it? Well, it is a bit solid. Solid but not hollow. I think it's all rather horrid. Of course it is. For the rich. I didn't mean that. It's horrid that there should be so many people as poor as that. Horrid. What a nice ladylike word. A wet day is horrid but... Poverty is horrible. Do you think what he wants is possible? Possible and certain. It must come. It would be good if it did. Not for you. Not for you either for that matter. You're not a worker. Not the way he means. Nonsense. Of course I am. I'm not a labourer, but I work. I earn my living instead of being a parasite. Who lives on other people's work. What should I read next, Mr Radshaw? Hello Hamer lad. Hello. Sorry to hear about your granddad. He did pop off sudden, didn't he. Aye, it was sudden. I only heard about it this morning. It fair took me back. - Nobody guessed how ill he was. What's you and your mother going to do now? I doubt the two of you will get very fat out of old Suddaby. No. I was going to say. If you was looking for a job... What? I want a man with me to go to the market in the morning to pick up the stuff. I've got a lot of interests, I have. I've hardly time to get around properly. What would you pay? Fifteen shillings a week. A bit more as it grows. It's heavy work, you know. Some of it. Alright. I'll do it. When do I start? Five o'clock tomorrow morning, lad. Wake up, Hamer lad. You've hardly started yet. Hamer. It's half past one. In three hours' time you have to be up. You must get some sleep, son. Sleep. Sleep never got anyone anywhere. But you can't work all day and all night too. You'll kill yourself. I am dead now, mum. This is going to bring me alive. Only four new branches in four years. Too slow, Hamer. I'll be a hundred years old before we've got a good business at this rate. Hamer. Arnold Ryerson. How are you, Arnold? Come on in. Sit down, Arnold. Well, how is everything? - Not too bad. You and Tom are going ahead. Tom is always going somewhere. Well. How is the printing trade? - Not so bad. You've done some public speaking they tell me. Down at the working man's club. I find politics quite a relief from selling cabbages. Would you like to add a bit more to it? How? Well, Old Rochester. The old MP for St. Swithins. Has died. - Yes? And they think it's time we ran a candidate of our own. Who do they think should stand? Well. They have asked me. A very good choice too. I congratulate you, Arnold. - Thanks, Hamer. I doubt there's much chance to get in. But we might give them a fight. The union is very strong there. That's the only reason they asked me. Because I've been doing the organising. Who's backing you? - You mean, money? A Miss Lightowler chiefly. It won't cost much. Of course I've no money. Who is against you? - Lord Liskeard. Old Lostwithiel's son? - That's right. What I wondered was, whether you would come over and give us a hand, Hamer. You mean, speak? - Yes. Nothing formal I mean. Just a few words to get the audience going. Well, if you don't mind something impromptu. Of course not. You've got the gift of it anyhow. Well, I'll expect to see you then. Well, If I can get away. Goodbye, Arnold. - Goodbye and thanks. Mister Chairman. Ladies. No. Madam Chairman. Madam Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen. When I entered this hall tonight it was not in my mind to address you. But there are times when the words that leap... That. Spring spontaneously to the lips... Hey! You. What are you doing here? - Reading. Is that a crime in England? Reading? You're trespassing, my lad. This is the Earl of Lostwithiel's property. Walk yourself off and be quick about it. - I'm doing no harm. No harm? You be off. You spit when you speak. Do you do it on purpose or can't you help it? Look, lad. None of your lip. Get out and quick. Or I'll... - You'll what? I'll show you. Keep your hands off me. Oh. So it's like that, is it? See this? Now you get going before you get a charge of shot in your backside. What on earth is going on here? Richard. Good afternoon, madam. I regret I was compelled to give one of your keepers a lesson in manners. What's been happening, Richard? This young fellow is trespassing and tossing paper muck about, Your Ladyship. This is private property. Will you kindly go? Yes, madam. I apologise for having made use of the view and... And even the air without paying you rent for it. It's more to the point to apologise for assaulting a man... Twenty years older than yourself. Your cap is on the ground there. And your paper bag. Or whatever it is. Good afternoon. While those who own the means of production take... Two million, 375 thousand pounds. Well now. Those figures show what the working man gets out of it all. And what we have to ask ourselves... What we've got to ask ourselves is... Is it right and proper... And justice. That one man should get more than he wants. And another so little he cannot keep body and soul together. It stands to reason it can't be, doesn't it. Well, that's what we say and... That's what we're fighting for. Now, ladies and gentlemen. Any questions for the candidate? Come along now. We don't mind if you agree with us or disagree. As long as we get the thing talked out frankly and intelligently. Madam Chairman. Yes, sir? I have no question to put to the candidate. But I have one that I have often put to myself. Which I should like to put to every man and woman in this room. It's a very simple question. You and I were born poor. Born without rights. Born to labour all our days. To keep roofs over our heads. To make a bare living for our loved ones. Yet. Some few others. With no gift, no special virtue. Are born to ease and luxury. The houses we live in are theirs. And we must pay to live in them. The very fields which with unconscious irony we call... 'Our land'. Belong to them. If we enter their fields we're bustled off as if we were trespassers. Why is this? My friends. You will remember Our Lord's question to the Pharisees. Is this... from heaven... or of men? That's the question I wish to put to you about the life of the poor and the rich. Did God ordain it? This contrast between sweat and ease, between want and luxury. Or is it the product of man's will? Of greed? Of selfishness? Hamer. That was grand. What would I give to be able to do that. - Nothing. They just needed something. The next meeting? - Tomorrow at Fortingall. But tonight? There's no time to be lost. - I've no hall booked for tonight. Well, get me a box and a cart and we'll go down to the market square. What now? - Yes. Now. You haven't met Miss Lightowler. She's the chairman of our campaign committee. Good speech, young man. - It was nothing. Maybe. But it sounded alright. My niece says she knows you. How do you do? It's years since we met. Yes. I hardly expected to meet you on a labour platform. But don't you realise? I'm one of your converts. Come on, Arnold. It's a long way to Westminster. Next stop, the market square. You coming? Of course he's coming. We're all coming Lead on, young man. Well come on, Pen dear. For our crusade. I give you a text. I saw a new heaven. And a new earth. But I ask to serve you. As my father served you. As. My grandfather served you. And. As his father served you before him. I therefore ask you to vote for me. Ryerson! Ryerson. Good morning, madam. Is your husband voting for Mr Ryerson and freedom? If he doesn't he gets the biggest hiding he's ever had in his life, Mr Radshaw. That's fine. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. I beg of you to listen to me, gentlemen. Please, gentlemen. So you've started to appeal to decency now? Let me tell you this, sir. A man who appeals to decency during an election is a man who knows he's losing. This is not a parish tea. But I felt this fellow Radshaw was offending some of the steadier elements. 'Steadier elements'? There aren't steadier elements. Any waster has got a vote now. To get every vote in the district, what you want are some men. Good reliable fellows who will pull him off his soapbox. And shove him in the river when he talks his revolutionary twaddle. Why, when my father was elected, his tenants held the bridge for eight hours. So the Whigs couldn't get to the poll. I know, father. But you can't do things like that nowadays. Anyway. I can't believe many people want to be represented by a man like Ryerson. Like Ryerson? He doesn't matter a tinker's cuss. It's this fellow who barks for him. Well, go on and get out. It's no good standing there and looking like a fish. Go out and fight them. You have the name and money and everything that you want. Go out and fight them instead of bleating about decency. Promise them something. That's what they want. Promises. Lip salve like this other fellow gives them. Send letters out to sell kisses for votes. Like Georgiana did for Charlie Fox. Anything. I doubt that would get him far. Don't believe it, my dear. They would vote for him for a kiss from you. I nearly would myself. Knowing him to be just a damp, wet fish. A pity we can't put you into breeches and put you up. You would get in. By gad you would. But I warn everybody that if I have to start kissing people in this election... I shall begin with the rival candidate. He is my fancy. - What, Ryerson? That ninny? - No. The other one. Radshaw? I admire your taste, Lettice. He's very handsome, isn't he Buck. Yes, my dear. He would look prettier still with a rotten egg in his eye. Go on, go on. Get on with it. You'd better go with him. He's not fit to cross the street alone. Come on, Charles. Are you Hannaway? Aye, Milord. Are you... a tenant of mine? Aye, Milord. I see. Well, look. I don't have radical tenants. I'm no radical, Milord. - Aren't you though? No. I'm one of the old school myself. Don't you employ this... This chap... this Radshaw? Aye, Milord. Is it good to employ a chap of that kind? It won't do, Hannaway. Either he goes. Or you do. See? Look here, Milord. The places I get from you I pay good money for. Better than you ever had for them before. If what you say is, if I don't do this or don't do that you'll give me notice. All I can say is: go on, give away. I'm not a widow with six kids. I can find somewhere else and I can pay for it. So if there's nothing more you want I'll just be saying good morning. So you won't get rid of this chap, eh? I'll do what I think is good for my business, Milord. Good morning. Mr Hannaway. Aye, Milord? Come and sit down and let me put this to you another way. I hope it's a better way than the last one, Milord. I ought to have seen you were a man of some independence. Sit down and let's talk business. Business, Milord. On that subject I'm always ready to talk with anybody. Now, this man Radshaw. Hello, Hamer. - Hello, Tom. This is a nice place you have here. Have you bought it or just renting it? It's Miss Lightowler's. I'm staying here. Are you sleeping here as well? - Yes. Well, that's rather what I wanted to talk to you about, Hamer. Things is not going too well with the shops. Oh. I'm sorry about that. What's wrong? You know how it is. Nobody in charge. Nothing getting done. When can we reckon on you coming back? Immediately after the election. In four days' time. Four days? That is a long time. It is what we agreed. - I know that. But that was before I knew there was going to be all this trouble. I reckon you ought to come back before that, Hamer. When do you suggest? Tomorrow. Or the day after at the latest. And leave all my work here? Your work here isn't going to make your living for you, is it lad? Why have you suddenly thought of all this? Come on. I'm not as dumb as all that. You want me out of this election. Why? Now look here, Hamer lad. You and me have known one another for a long time. We can afford to be frank. This work you do here. This tub-thumping and getting your name in the papers. It isn't doing you any good, you know. Why? Why? Because it puts you up against those you can't afford to be up against. Them that I can't afford to be up against either. Ah. So. You've been talking to His Lordship? Never you mind who I've been talking to. What I'm telling you is for your own good. Well, how much? What do you mean, how much? How much is it worth in cash to have me out of St. Swithins? Don't talk like a fool, Hamer. Tom. Business is business. You say I can't afford to be up against somebody. Well... What can somebody afford not to be up against me? Now look here, Hamer lad. You've got a good steady job. And maybe soon it might run into a bit more. How much more? Maybe ten shillings a week. Where's your profit in that, Tom? Look. I'll do a deal with you. You go back to His Lordship and get him to write out and sign a proper contract. 'In regard of Hamer Radshaw withdrawing from the St Swithins election I...' 'I hereby undertake to pay said Hamer Radshaw a bribe of not less than...' You are crazy. Goodbye, Tom. Alright. But don't think you can come back to me for a job. That's all. I don't think so. From now on I have to manage selling brains instead of cabbages. And Tom. This time sell them without putting dirt on them to make them weigh heavier. In ten minutes we shall know. There you are. That will show you who your benefactors are. Good old Buck. Good old Buck. Hello. There is Mr Radshaw. Talking of greengrocers. How do, Radshaw? Back to the carrots tomorrow morning, eh? Somebody offered me a bigger bribe to go into another business. What sort of business? Cheapjack? That's the man you want to watch. You may be alright this time with a bit of luck but... You watch that fellow. The by-election result. Lord Liskeard. 24 thousand. Six hundred. Mr Ryerson. 23 thousand eight hundred. What did he say? I can't hear. Liskeard is in by 1,800. Good old Liskeard. Hooray. I reckon if it had been Radshaw he'd have walked it. Radshaw? He'd have been kicked out you mean. What do you mean? Come on now. Good old Liskeard. Well. Within two years old Lostwithiel will die. Liskeard will go to the Lords. And may the Lord help them. There will be a by-election. I shall stand for this constituency. And I will win it. Will you help me, Ann? Yes, Hamer. If I can. The first step. Only the first. What are the other steps? They go a long way. Out of sight. Yes. They can go wherever you like. As far as you like. Come here. Will you go with me? To see where they go. You think that would help? - I shan't go if you don't. Nonsense, Hamer. You have no choice. Do you want to come with me? - Yes. But... I'm not sure how much good I can be. Come and see, darling. We want Radshaw. We want Radshaw. We want Radshaw. We want Radshaw. We want Radshaw. Honourable members on the other side of the house have called us agitators. We accept that title proudly. And we shall continue to agitate. Until we have driven home the lesson that, at the root of all our troubles... Lies man's inhumanity to man. That's splendid. I think it will raise the tone of debate above the usual squabbling level. There's only one thing. - What? When you're talking about working conditions. Couldn't you introduce some examples? - I mentioned the misery and squalor. Yes. But they're so used to hearing words like that. Can't you say what misery and squalor really means to a working family? My dear girl, it simply doesn't fit. I cannot suddenly introduce a... Mrs Jones or a Mr Smith who... I suppose not. It was just that I... Trouble is, you don't understand the technique of public speaking. Particularly speaking in The House. - Anyhow it's a fine speech. It's complete nonsense to say that I'm not being concrete. Honourable members on the other side of the house have called us agitators. We are agitators. We accept that title proudly. We agitate. For the widow. Struggling along on ten shillings a week in a leaky hovel. For the miner. Coughing and sweating as he hews. Yes. Yes, that's it. What do you mean? That is what I wanted. A moment ago you said I was not being 'concrete' enough. You don't listen, my dear. I am sorry, darling. Now, how about the letters? Doncaster on the evening of the 17th. Is that possible? You are in Glasgow on the 16th. And Edinburgh on the 18th. No. You can't keep on with these night train journeys, darling. I must. Hardy and MacDonald are both going. Accept. But Hamer, you'll kill yourself. Well, do you know of any better way of dying? Accept and find out about the night train. There's a darling. Hello. Listen to this. From Arnold Ryerson. 'This is to ask you if you could spare a day to come and give us a hand here'. 'There is no doubt that the strike is weakening'. 'It will give the men heart if someone with a name in the party comes down'. 'I've done all I can my way'. 'What we want now is...' 'Your sort of thing'. Poor Arnold. One of the best organisers in the country but not a spark of... Of spirit. They've been out five weeks. Some of them will be nearly starving. It's not easy to raise many sparks against that. Isn't it? Wire him I'll come right away. But you haven't a day free this week. Then I must make one. This thing matters. If you think I'll let the miners be beaten... And the strike collapse because no-one can give them a lead. The press have been crowing. But it can't last another week. I'll make them crow on the other side of their faces. Arnold is right. What's wanted is my sort of thing, and... By God they shall have it. Hamer. - Yes. You won't forget. You're pretty strong meat for an empty stomach. I'll remember that, darling. You've got a full house anyway. Hamer. What they want to be shown is that what they're doing is of some use. And you chaps up in London realise it. What they must realise is that this is a fight. Well. That's the army that's got to fight this battle and win it. Down here when they say fight they mean it. I've had to hold them off any sort of violence pretty hard. We don't want too much talk about armies, Hamer. They've brought the troops down here already. Well. Let's get going. Well boys, I only want to welcome on your behalf... Hamer Radshaw. You know all about Hamer. I want him to be able to go back and tell them in the House of Commons. That the miners of South Wales are solid behind this strike. And they're going to win. Hamer Radshaw. Friends. I want you... to look at this weapon. A foul murder was done with it. I want you to help me convict... And punish the murderers. They are still abroad in this land. Killing. Not perhaps with the sword. But with the slower weapons. Starvation. Cold. What change has there been? I ask you. What? A hundred years of civilisation we see. But those years have not civilised the treatment of the worker. The workers of Peterloo asked for bread. They called it an 'unlawful assembly'. And cut them down. Men, women and children. You. Ask for a living wage. And the answer is... Starvation for your wives and your children. There was only one possible answer to that charge of the dragoons at Peterloo. What was it? You know it. God help us. We are men. We see our wives and our children suffering and starving before our eyes. As men, what can we do? Are we to go crawling back to take what is sneeringly thrown at us? Or shall we... As men... Be ready to throw our very lives into the balance to win this struggle? Men of Wales. The choice lies with you. Come on, boys. To the offices! Steady, boys. You shouldn't have done that, Hamer. Stand steady, boys. They won't be stopped now, Arnold. Come on. Look, Arnold. There's going to be trouble if you don't watch out. They've got troops down there. - I know. Now listen, lads. Stop! Stop, lads. Is Ryerson there? - I can't see him, sir. I had better see. Shall I try? - No, no. This is a matter of public order. Now be quiet. Everybody. Is Mr Ryerson there? Yes, Mr Clark. - Now, Mr Ryerson. I must hold you responsible for bringing these men here. And as a magistrate... I must order you to take them away at once. Otherwise. I shall have no alternative but to read the riot act. He had better come in or he'll get one in the eye. They are off this time. Open the gates! Or we tear them down. Our Sovereign leader, the Queen. Charges and commands... That all persons being assembled immediately disperse themselves... Arnold, you'll have to come along. If you arrest him you'd better arrest me too. I don't know anything about you. If you had any hand in starting this. I hope you are proud of it. Come on, Arnold boy. Mr Radshaw. Mr Radshaw. Can you give me anything on this, Mr Radshaw? South Wales Gazette. Yes. I hope the owners and management realise that this man's death... Lies at their door. However statesmanlike the leadership may be... It cannot argue men into sitting quietly through growing want and misery. It's been said Mr Radshaw that the whole thing arose from a speech of yours. Of mine? - Yes. That you worked them up to attack the officers. Look, friend. I don't know what your politics are and I don't care. If you value honesty in public life you'll nail that lie at once. Well, we were told you used the word 'fight' rather a lot, didn't you. And showed them a sword and so on. If you tear bits of a speech from its context you make it mean anything. When the crowd rushed the office... We stood there shouting ourselves hoarse trying to bring them back. Is it likely that responsible men like Ryerson and I would advocate violence? Votes for women. Hello. - Hello, darling. Be quiet please, Hamer. I've got Lizzie in bed upstairs. Lizzie who? - Aunt Lizzie. Why is she in bed? They tried to break up a suffragette procession. Lizzie carried a banner. Some brute of a man hit her in the face. And given her a prize black eye. Don't tell Lizzie is mixed up with all that nonsense. Can I see her? - Yes. She is awake. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Why, Lizzie. Hello, Hamer. What have you been doing? - Agitating like no lady. I look nice, don't I. A man did that? - Hmm. On purpose? I don't know what he had in mind. He hit me with his fist. Why? He doesn't hold with votes for women. Nor do I for that matter. But I don't go around hitting them. You say you don't? Here you are. Ann. Your first job. Here in the home. And he means a vote in the House. Lizzie. You mustn't do this sort of thing. Really you mustn't. I'm a bit long in the tooth for it. - You might get seriously hurt. I was seriously hurt this time. I hurt like the very Dickens. You may get something worse. I might get something better. I might get votes for women. My dear Lizzie. Do you think men will ever allow petticoat government? You think businessmen will allow power to the labour party? That's a different thing. They can't stop us. Nor us. Here is a booklet. I wrote it myself. Poor English but good argument. You read it. Take him away, Ann. Bring him back when he's seen the light. I am going to get up in a minute. Talk to him about it at breakfast, lunch and dinner. And in bed. Some of our members say that is very effective. Why on earth did Lizzie have to get mixed up with that rowdy mob? She fights for something she believes in. I tell you it has no chance of success politically. Is that a reason for not believing in it? Look. Ann. You're not telling me that... What? That you are a slave to male tyranny. If you mean, do I support votes for women, then the answer is that I do. Oh well. So long as you keep quiet about it... Hamer. Lizzie has asked me to join her action group. I've said I will. You mean, she wants you to march in processions and... Carry banners? - Yes. My dear Ann. Be reasonable. If you won't consider your position you might at least consider mine. Yours? Yes. I have made a certain reputation both inside the House and... Out of it. Though I say it myself, I am regarded as a coming-man. It's absolutely essential that nothing should happen to damage my standing. It would damage your standing for your wife to preach what she believes in? Yes. Yes. All these processions and free fights. I've marched in processions before. But these women are simply crude agitators. But Hamer. Aren't we all agitators? Aren't you one? 'Agitators'. Said like that... There are times when agitation is justifiable but after a time you need... Something else. - What? Well. A certain amount of, shall we say... Statesmanship. Oh, Hamer. If you want votes for women I see no reason why you shouldn't press for it. But without all... All this nonsense. Did you see any reason why the miners in South Wales... Should not go on asking politely for a rise? You've no right to cast that at me. You know what happened in South Wales had nothing to do with me. I believe in fighting and fighting hard but... I've never supported hooliganism. Never. Never. Hamer. You heard? - Part of it. You know, he really believes that. Oh yes. Hamer can believe anything he wants to. Well, Ann. I shall go on of course. You're sure? There's no doubt about it. Besides. Hamer would want me to. It sounded like it. I mean, Hamer as he was. Hamer as he still is under all this... This statesmanship. Oh, Lizzie. I am afraid. I know, my dear. So are we all. But must is must. Votes for women! Votes for women. Votes for women. It's not as a well-known leader of left-wing thought... That Mr Radshaw speaks to us tonight. But as an Englishman. And as one of the most thoughtful of our younger statesman. No need for you to do anything unless you like to, Ann dear. He is an MP. The decision was to cover every meeting addressed by an MP. Good girl. He represents something that stands above party. Mr Radshaw. Quite a change from St. Swithins, huh? He is still very handsome. Mister chairman. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. It's not good for a country. Or for a politician. To fix eyes solely on internal affairs. Therefore. I welcome this opportunity to speak to you tonight on the subject of... Europe and peace. The two words have been coupled together... Does the speaker support votes for women? I do believe it's his wife. The subject before the meeting madam is Europe and peace. Your question is therefore... - Bunkum. Answer. Votes for women. Votes for women. Votes for women. Votes for women! Votes for women. The subject before the meeting ladies and gentlemen this evening. Is Europe. And peace. How long has Radshaw been on hunger strike now? Four days. - Nearly five, doctor. What do you think, Charles? - We can't leave it much longer. How does she seem? She's not there when you speak to her. I have seen it before. They're always the ones that go on. I'd say give her until tomorrow morning and then forcible feeding. Nothing else for it. - I hate that business. It's better than just letting her slip off. I don't like the look of her. Her chest is not at all good. Alright. Report to me at this time tomorrow. If she hasn't eaten by then, have the force-feeding team stand by. Very well, doctor. Come along, Charles. The subject before the meeting madam is Europe and peace. Well. Come on, Arnold. It's a long way to Westminster. These women are simply crude agitators. I shall stand for this constituency. And I will win it. The subject before the meeting madam is Europe and peace. Is Europe and peace. I know my dear. So are we all. Must is must. Lady Lostwithiel to see you, sir. Lady Lostwithiel? Please show her in. - Yes, sir. Mr Radshaw. I do hope you remember me. - But of course. I have seen and admired from a distance. Since the day you hit Richards and said nasty things about us at St. Swithins. That was a long time ago. - Longer than I care to remember. Won't you sit down, Lady Lostwithiel? - Thank you. I hope you'll forgive this intrusion. But I was anxious for news of your wife. My wife is in Holloway gaol. Yes. I know. This hunger strike business and so on. But is anything happening? I mean, is the home office acting? But my dear man, surely you're doing something about it? I respect what my wife has done. She wished it to be this way. I dare say. But if you don't do something she may die purely because papers get mislaid. You know the home secretary? Only as a political opponent. I only know him as a darling old bore at dinner. But he is quite nice. Supposing I were to go and see him? That is too kind of you. - For auld lang syne. Besides. My sympathies are entirely with your wife and the other people. I think they're perfectly splendid. You mean you are a suffragette? - Rather. I'm afraid I do not do things like your wife. I just haven't the courage. But I give a hand in other ways. No. No! No. Dear old Freddy was very nice. He's so worried about the whole thing of course. I cannot thank you adequately. - But I did nothing. The order for her release had already gone. Now get on round there. I have my carriage outside. If you drop me at Halton Street you can take it straight on. That's more than kind of you. - Nonsense. I told you. This is the only sort of contribution I make. Thank you very much. I can manage now. Goodbye. You go home, my dear. Forget all about it. Alright. Darling. Darling, don't. It's alright now. You know. I've got you. Don't cry. I'm not crying really. It's just... It's so lovely. We'll soon be home now. Then you can go to bed and rest. Then we'll go away somewhere. Somewhere right away. Whose is this? - What, darling? The carriage. It's all different. It's Lady Lostwithiel's. Lady Lostwithiel? - Hmm. The St. Swithins one? Yes. I happened to meet her and she offered it. But why? Partly because she's a suffragette herself I gather. Partly, as she put it. For auld lang syne. Yes. It is rather funny, isn't it. Now, steady. Steady. Well? I'm sorry, Radshaw. But there is very little I can do. No chance at all? There's always a chance of some sort but... I think you should be prepared to... lose her. Was it... This starvation business? No. The infection has obviously been there a long time. That will have accelerated it. She will want to know. - My dear man, she knows already. She knew before I did. I don't know that I like this housekeeper business. You'll probably get hold of some awful woman who will make you marry her. You'll be very eligible you know darling. Alright then. A manservant. One of those gentleman's gentleman who do everything. Much better. He will probably be very firm with you about your clothes. Yes. I believe... They are. What is the matter? I was just thinking how extraordinarily hardened one gets to this situation. To hear us, you might think we were on our honeymoon. That's not getting hardened. That is getting un-softened. That is quite different. Yes. Of course. I suppose so. Ann. Will you tell me something? If I can. What shall I do? Over my work? Do? Shall I go on? Of course. After what's happened? Go back into public life to speak and write and... Wrangle. But that will come right, darling. Of course it will. I suppose it may. Hamer. There's something I have to tell you. Something that will hurt. Nothing you could say could hurt me, my dear. Oh yes it could. But I have to say it now or not at all. Hamer. You do that too often. Do what? Ask questions when you really know the answers. You know you wouldn't... You couldn't leave politics. It is your whole life. Yet you pretend to me and yourself... That you might. You must stand on the balcony, darling. Look out at the mountains. And talk about whether you will go on. But it is all play-acting. You mean I'm insincere? No. It is not quite that. But you watch yourself in a queer way from outside. And you behave. As you think that man you're watching would behave. I don't know how to put it but... It all comes from outside somehow instead of from inside. How long have you felt this? A long time. Ever since I first knew you. I must have been very unpleasant to live with. Hamer, darling. Don't be angry with me. I would not have told you but... I can't stay with you and... I am so afraid. Afraid to make you unhappy. You're so good when you don't do it. Ann. Darling. Don't. It is perfectly true. I know it's perfectly true. I'm nothing but an actor. No. You are not. That is just the point. It's only sometimes. It terrifies me. There is nothing in the world to be terrified about because... I do know. I can do something about it. And you will remember? Yes, darling. I will. Truly. If only you could get back. To like it was when you used to lecture me in the bookshop. Or like it was when you first came to St. Swithins. Get back? Will I ever get back? One gets older and... Becomes more experienced. Sees better how to get things done. Oh yes. Yes, I do feel that. It's just... I am afraid. You might change your mind about what needs to be done. Darling. How could I? I was born poor. My whole life has been dedicated to the service of the poor. Things might change. My circumstances may change but... But could you really believe that could change? Ann. Look at me. Tell me. Could you believe that? I believe in you, Hamer. I always have. Darling. That's the last of the 'musts' done. Must? Things I had to do. Horrible frightening things. I couldn't get out of them. Darling Hamer. Only nice things left now. Mr Ryerson has called to see you, sir. Mr Ryerson? Show him in. - Yes, sir. Hello, Hamer. Nice of you to come, Arnold. Being up here on another thing I've just come in to say all the usual things. Thank you. Sit down, Arnold. - Thank you. Pen sends her love and sympathy. She's not in London? - No. She couldn't get up. Hamer. I know this is no time to talk about other things but... Have you seen the papers? Not for days. I'm afraid I'm completely out of touch. There's going to be a war, Hamer. You mean over the Serbian thing? - Aye. The Germans demand a passage through Belgium. And we've sent an ultimatum to Germany. Have we, by gum? Is the cabinet solid on it? - Near enough. Morley will go, I reckon. But that's about all. What is the party doing? - Well. There is a split. Hardy and MacDonald are standing out. I reckon Henderson will go in with the government. You are the man that matters in South Wales. Where do you stand? Well. I don't know, Hamer. I have been preaching non-violence all my life. I don't see how I can back out of that as soon as it comes to a test. Can we stand out? I don't know but I reckon we can try. If we stand out and yet the country goes to war we shall get nowhere. Arnold. If we play our cards right this may be a great opportunity. To do what? For Labour to take its place in the government. To increase its prestige. Maybe you're right, Hamer. I'd have said it was an opportunity for Labour to stick to its principles. Yes. But my dear Arnold we must deal with things as they are. Everybody disagrees with war in principle but nobody... Nobody is such a fool as to let his principles interfere with his practice. Well. I am sorry, Hamer. I didn't mean to come and start an argument. Not with things as they are with you. Alright. But I just don't see that the line you take is practical politics. I never said it was. But then. I suppose I am not a practical politician. Well. I had better be going. - Wait. I'll go along with you. I must go and see MacDonald. It will be a tragedy if he insists on standing out. Hello Hamer. - Lettice. I am so glad you were able to come. I have the minister of mines here. He very much wants a chat with you. I think he wants something. So be on your guard. - Thank you, Lettice. I will. By the way, I met an old friend of yours the other night. One Hannaway. Hannaway? - Yes. You know, Hamer. I think he was the most deliciously vulgar man I ever met. Masses of money. All made out of profiteering. And pointed for the next honours list like a compass needle. He has got it all fixed. Sir Thomas or bust. The fact remains. That these strikes are a serious blow to the country's war effort. They are the result of years of mishandling the industry. That may be so, Radshaw. But surely this is no time for private quarrels. I know your views and I honour you for them. But we need your help. What sort of help? You have the ear of these chaps. If you could bring South Wales... Wholeheartedly behind the government it would be the biggest thing you ever did. Something that wouldn't be forgotten. Either by the government or the country. You think it over, old man. There is a big opportunity here. May we be told who asked you come down here, Mr Radshaw? It wasn't Arnold Ryerson this time anyway. He's in jail. I was asked to come by the minister of mines. I accepted because I think... - He's a friend of yours, is he? He is no friend of ours. He's no friend of mine either but I think he's an honest man... Doing his best for the war effort. - The boss's war. Be reasonable. It's nonsense to call this a boss's war. Then whose war is it? - Ours. All of us. It may be yours but it's not mine, friend. Not yours? How can it not be yours? Do you think you can be a citizen of a country until it's in danger... And then contract out and say you're not concerned? Hasn't our cry always been that this is our country? Not the boss's. How can it ever be our country if you won't fight for it? Go home, man. Tell that where they haven't heard it before. Go home? You tell me to go home? I'm at home here among working men if I'm at home anywhere. Aye. We know. My friends. I've been fighting for the worker all my life. Now you think it's time he went and fought for you? They say in London that the miner is no patriot. If he were, he'd not be striking when the country struggles for its life. I say that's a damned lie. You're out of date, friend. The miner has had all that talk he can stomach. I don't believe you. I don't believe patriotism is out of date in Wales. Here's an offer. Get your men together and give me a quarter of an hour... And you'll prove black is white. You go home, Mr Radshaw. That's the best thing for you to do. You're afraid to let me speak? We're afraid of what might happen to you. To me? What does that matter when men are dying? Like Dai Evans did the last time you came here. Where is your sword? In your pocket? - Now, boys. Wait a minute. Mr Radshaw has come a long way. Aye. Let him go back a long way. The quicker the better. Trying to show wider issues to a crowd of working men is like... Trying to show a picture to a blind man. It's a rotten job... For a man like you to make yourself unpopular with the rank and file. One can only do what one thinks is right. Goodnight, Sir Hamer. Goodnight. Well, Templeton. We are in. Congratulations, Sir Hamer. Yes. We haven't got a clear majority but we are the biggest single party. There will be a labour government at last. Lizzie, my dear. This is sweet of you. You oughtn't to be out as late as this. I had to come to offer you my congratulations. We're in, eh? - Yes. No doubt about it this time. We've not a clear majority but still... We're going to drink to it. Thank you, Jane. I'm glad it has come, Hamer. I began to wonder if I'd ever see it. My dear Lizzie. I began to wonder whether I should. Forty years is a long time. What dear? I said, forty years is a long time to wait. Only two glasses. There should have been more. Yes. I wish old Arnold were here. We had our disagreements but... No-one has done more for the party. You know his wife is dead? Pen? She's dead. She died last month. - Pen dead. Everybody is dead. There ought to be more people here. Not just you and an old trout like me. All the people from the old days. General, you're victorious. But where's the troops? All killed. Or gone. Well, never mind. Here's to us and to victory after forty years. God bless you, my dear. Do you know yet what they're giving you? I saw Ramsay today. He asked me to take Internal Affairs. Foreign affairs? No. Internal Affairs. Well, well. Here is to it, my dear. Another glass? - No, Hamer. No more. It's long past my bedtime. I just came in because I had to. Thank you, my dear. You still have that old sword, I see. - Aye. That's always gone with me everywhere. You have a sheath for it now. - Yes. I had that made. That's rather nice. Very nice. Keep it bright, dear. These are all personal, minister. - Right. Thank you. You know the cabinet has been postponed until four? Yes. I took the papers directly after lunch. Would you like to see Parsons now or later? I told him to stand by. I will let you know. What time is this meeting? You should be leaving now. One other thing, minister. You asked me to draft a reply to Ryerson about meeting the hunger marchers. Oh dear. Yes. - If you'd just look at it. Read it to me. 'Dear Arnold'. 'It would have given me great personal pleasure to join with my friends'. 'In one more gesture in the interest of the poor and suffering'. 'But, as a member of the cabinet'. 'I am bound by the policy which we agreed'. 'And which I am convinced is correct'. 'All my experience leads me to deprecate mass action'. 'And to favour the constitutional use of the machinery of the government'. 'With all good wishes. Yours, etc, etc'. Just the right note. Get it off at once. Put 'private and personal'. Thank you, minister. Well done, comrades. Well marched. Alright, lads. Ten minutes for a cup of tea. Lizzie, my old dear. What the devil are you doing here? I always come to meet people who need me. How are you, Arnold? I can do with a drink and a sit down. But I am afraid. How many have we here, Lizzie? - Quite a few, my dear. Aye. It's a fine big crowd out of seven million. I expect there's a football match on. Anyone here who matters? - They all matter. Aye. So they do. No bigwigs. None of the cabinet. You mean Hamer? No. I wrote to him. And you thought he'd come? No. I suppose not. Well, Sir Thomas. Why so pensive? I was watching the lads running poor old Hamer around over there. If you doubt me, try looking at your own figures. Millions going out to keep men in idleness. I was up in Glasgow last week. There's just one blast furnace working on the whole of Clydeside. But no government that took a really strong line would last five minutes. You know Radshaw pretty well, don't you? Aye, as well as most people I suppose. The whole thing should be treated as a national emergency. Let's pull together and stop squabbling. - Ideally, yes. You chaps are in the saddle. You've plenty of support I can tell you. From the opposition? - I'm absolutely sure of it. Do you seriously mean... If you give a lead and call for national unity... You'd have every decent element in the country with you. Is it the same up north, Hannaway? I don't know much about decent elements. You see, I'm only a businessman. Anyway, why pick on Hamer here? Chaps like him and me who worked our way up from the bottom must tread careful. Why not go to the Prime Minister? Confound it all. Hamer is the most influential man in the cabinet. Maybe. Don't let them kind you, Hamer. You are sitting pretty. You can't afford to make mistakes. Very kind. But at the moment we're not discussing my personal welfare. Circulate, darlings. Circulated please. Hamer. You come with me. What did you say that for? I'd got him groggy. You see. Hamer is an old pal of mine. He takes notice of what I say to him. In a kind of a way. "This is the national programme." "Here is the news. Copyright reserved." "The national government." "It was announced from Downing Street this evening." "That the King has been pleased to approve." "The appointment of a cabinet of ten." "To undertake the task of balancing the budget." "Four members of this cabinet have been drawn from the Labour Party." "Four from the Conservatives and two from the Liberals." "Broadcasting tonight, the Prime Minister said:" "It is not a coalition government." "I would take no part in that." "It's not a government which compels any party to it, to change its principles." "Or to subordinate its distinctive individual..." Oh. Hello Arnold. Alright, Pendleton. You're to be at the Palace at ten, Sir Hamer. It's ten-to now. - Alright. I'm sorry, Arnold. It's good to see you but I have an appointment. It is true then. What? You are going in with them. MacDonald has asked me to stick to my post. I think it's my duty to do so. I nearly knocked Tom Williams down when he said that you were in it. Arnold, I am very sorry. Is it true that one of their conditions was a cut in the dole? There was no question of conditions. To hell with your parliamentary answers. Have you sold the unemployed? No. - You're a liar. You and I are old friends but if you only want to abuse me... Abuse you? God help you, man. It's you who abuse yourself. How can you do it Hamer, after what we went through all those years? And you married to a woman like Ann. Don't it mean anything? Didn't it ever mean anything? - Arnold. My dear fellow. There's far too much sentimental talk about the 'old days' in this party. We're no longer a little bunch of enthusiasts. Speaking at street corners. We are... The men who are responsible for the welfare of this country. It's not a personal matter. It is a matter of... Finance. High policy. I am very sorry, but I really must go. Must? There is no 'must' about it. You could do it yet. Send your car away. Ring them up and tell them to go to hell. Tell them you won't sell what you've worked for forty years. Sir Hamer. You're going to be late if we don't leave at once. Alright, Pendleton. I am coming. Very good, Sir. Come on, Arnold. Shake hands. Let's part as friends. After all, you and I have disagreed before. No. There's no grounds for friendship now. Lettice. - Hamer, my dear. How nice to see you. How are you? A little tired but otherwise well. Thank you, Lettice. I've a lot of people for you to meet. Well, my dear Lettice. I do nothing but meet people. The grandeur and spirit of England expressed in wood and stone. Lettice. If I brought the wrangling politicians here and stand them where I'm standing. They might... They might even become patriots. Hamer. Is that a proper sentiment for a democrat? My dear lady, what is democracy? Is it not a raising up rather than a... A levelling process? I said: 'Prime Minister, this is no matter to be settled without mature consideration'. 'In fact'. 'The maturest consideration of which we are jointly and severally capable'. Well, Hamer. When is the next election going to be? Well, well. I mustn't tell tales out of school. But... I think you can expect an appeal will be made to the country sooner or later. And. Sooner rather than later. And what will happen, Sir Hamer? My dear Prime Minister. Thank you for your most kind letter. I am too old a hand... To be disturbed by political defeat. But I'm now nearly seventy-five. Accordingly, I shall not seek re-election. The question of finding me a seat. Does not arise. I was deeply touched by the suggestion in your last paragraph. As you know. I have been in the past an opponent of the system of hereditary titles. But. As I have no children. It would perhaps be possible if His Majesty... Were so pleased to confer such an honour on me. To accept without sacrifice of principle. Yours. Etc, etc. Get that off at once, will you. - Yes, Sir Hamer. Rid of me. Rid of me. My Lord Mayor. Your Excellency. Your Grace. My Lords. Aldermen. Sheriffs. Ladies and Gentlemen. Pray silence. For the Right Honourable. The Lord Radshaw of Handforth. My Lord Mayor. Your Excellencies. Your Grace. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. Or, if I may use a shorter form of address. My friends. Tonight, my mind is drawn... Irresistibly. To thoughts of the past. The thoughts of that long road. That often bitter road. That a poor boy. From a Manchester slum. Stepped out to travel. So many years ago. My friends. It has been a long road. And many have fallen by the way. There must be few. If any here tonight. Who can remember the beginnings of that journey. If there were. I should call on them with confidence. To bear witness that... Despite all errors and failures and... Human weaknesses. I have striven. To carry a torch. A torch of... Fundamental principle. Which no personal consideration... Has ever been allowed to dim. I say I should make that claim. With confidence. With complete confidence. Are you alright, Milord? Yes. I just... I say to you... With confidence. That. After all, my friends. It is what matters. We must be confident in... In our destiny. The destiny... of our people. And their acumen. And don't forget, my friends. We must go on. What's the devil is the old boy talking about? I wish they'd stop him. It's pathetic. You ought to cut down on these affairs, Milord. They take too much out of you. - No. It's quite alright. Just a slight slip. The fire's not too much for you, Milord? No, no. It's fine. Thank you, Pendleton. You'll ring Milord if you want anything. And not get up. Yes, yes. Don't fuss. I don't want anything. Just to be left alone. Very good, Milord. Come on, Mrs Hannaway. The buzzer will be going before you get your stays on. I give you a text. I saw a new heaven. A new earth. We want Hamer. We want Hamer. We want Hamer. I believe in you, Hamer. I always have. Pendleton. Help me. What's happened, Milord? Draw it. Draw it. Milord, you really must not exhaust yourself like this. But it won't draw, Milord. It must have rusted in. It hasn't been drawn for so long. Give it to me. Milord, please. Come along, Milord. It's time for bed. No. Oh, yes it is. Let me take this. That's it. Now you can go to bed nice and quiet and read the report of your speech. I've put the evening papers beside your bed. By the bed? Do they...? Do they give it in full? Pretty near, Milord. Come along, Sir. ..s-d..
