I command you to appear before me. Plutarco Sat?n! I saved you from the justice of the world of the living... so that you can go on serving me. I have an important mission for you. Devil King! Father of Evil, King of the Dead. I'm tired! I want eternal peace. I shall never let you rest in peace! You shall return to the world, for that is my will. My Lord, I've been a faithful servant. Why should I be the one to carry out that mission? You can do anything. You think, as do all men, that my powers are unlimited. You are wrong! Only man can destroy man. Lucifer's wizard Yei Lin, will soon find the Sorensen formula... and will try to challenge me. Find the formula, and destroy Yei Lin! I'll find the formula, my Lord, and I will destroy Yei Lin. Beware! If you fail this time, you shall never have eternal peace. No! I won't fail, my lord. Let your hand continue to guide me towards eternal evil. So be it! Dr. Sat?n and Black Magic. Another failure. This formula is a fake. - Yei Lin does not tolerate mistakes. - It wasn't our fault. We followed his orders to the letter. - Boss! The formula that we... - I know all about it! I'll give you another chance. Your last chance. - It wasn't our fault. - Enough! The real formula will arrive tomorrow. Professor Sorensen. 12:30 p.m. Flight 103. You know what to do. You take care of everything, Dea. I'll go with you tomorrow. Yes, boss. There can be no mistakes this time. There won't be, sir. International Hotel. - Thank you. That'll be all. - At your service, sir. The lady who arrived first? Come in, please. - Take a seat, please. - Thank you. - Name, please? - Ang?lica Robles, sir. Do you have any experience doing this kind of work? Yes, I spent three years as a nurse and secretary to Dr. Benavides. The psychoanalyst. That's interesting. Why did you leave that job? The Doctor retired and moved to Europe. I see. This is the recommendation letter from Dr. Benavides. Your former employer holds you in quite high regard, miss. You have no family, do you? No, sir. I'm all alone in the world. Miss... Please inform the other applicants that the position has been filled. Thank you so much, Doctor! I really need this job. - I will try to do my best. - I'm sure you will. I'm sorry, ladies, but the opening has been filled. When do I begin? Right now. If that's... okay with you. I'm... at your... command. The others have just left. Thank you, Devil King. Father of Evil, King of the Dead. I take the soul and the body you have entrusted me. May its soul remain faithful to you for all eternity. Unbelievable! Professor Sorensen has been murdered? Wait for me. I'll be right over. From now on, you no longer possess a will of your own... or any memory of your existence in the world of the living. You will obey my orders... and you will worship the Devil King. And you will refer to me... as "My master". You are my master. Command and I will obey. It seems Sorensen opened the door with his own key... which is still in the keyhole. Any prints? Anything missing? Only a black briefcase, and his travel documents. We found his prints on the gun, but none on the knife. Besides, the receptionist said she didn't see anyone enter. Inform INTERPOL Tokyo. I'll expect a reply by tonight. Meanwhile, we must investigate those suspects who were... at the airport when the Professor arrived. Goodbye. You have a very important mission. Command, and we'll obey. I want to know the whereabouts of Yei Lin, the wizard... enemy of our Lord, the Devil King. We will search and we will find him. - You've done well this time. - Thank you, sir. It was easy, sir. - Only we had to... - I understand. Sorensen has been reunited with his ancestors. Be careful. INTERPOL and the police are looking for the criminal. - Is this the formula? - This is the one. Bromine, zinc, nickel... Almost all inferior metals can be transmuted into gold. My friends will have all they'll ever need. Provided that the formula works. You too will have a lot of gold. Gold was created by the Devil King to control the souls of men... but it turned out to be stronger than its creator. I figured that out... and I will become more powerful than the Devil King. Here I will control gold. Gold, to us, means power. With it, we can buy consciences and souls. The world will be in our hands. Inspector! I'm all done with the cyphering from Tokyo. Bring it to me at once. "Sorensen left four days ago, destination Mexico". "Unknown agent also flew to Mexico from Hong Kong". "Passport name Yei Lin". "Reliable sources confirm Yei Lin intends to steal Sorensen formula". - Anything else, Inspector? - No. You may go. Captain Mend?a, please report to my office. International Bank. I think the formula is correct. I did some minimum-scale tests, and this was the result. What metal is that? Gold. Pure gold. No doubt about it. - We did it. Success! - No. Not yet. We need to set up a large-scale laboratory. Marco, you will round up the materials. And Sergio, you will find a suitable location for the lab. And now, let's get some rest. It's been a fruitful day. - Is the alarm system on? - Of course. - I'll have a look at the garden. - I'll check the rest of the house. - We have obeyed your command. - We found Yei Lin. - Where? - A house on Road 32. But they will leave soon. Medusa had to kill one of his men. - How many left? - One man and one woman. Yei Lin possesses the Sorensen formula. He murdered the Professor and stole it. The Sorensen formula. Wonderful! It's all so clear. Yei Lin was turning lesser metals into gold. I'm beginning to understand just what kind of foe Yei Lin is. - I am pleased. - Thank you, Master. Gold. All the gold I want. I will most certainly carry out your orders, Devil King. We have the whole city under surveillance. Sooner or later, Yei Lin will fall. What about the other one? Still nothing. I need you. You will watch Yei Lin's house. When the time comes, I will deal with him myself. This is how the Devil King responds to your challenge. With death, Yei Lin! No human being can survive this poison! What's happening, Yei Lin? Open the door! Marco! Kick the door down! What's going on here? Nothing too serious. I was only giving the Devil King a display of my great power. - How do you feel, Master? - Much better. Where did that bat come from? That was Yei Lin himself. He can shapeshift at nights. He's a master of black magic. That's why he dares to challenge the Devil King. How will we kill him? According to tradition... this kind of wizard can only be killed... by driving a wooden stake through his heart. But... I'll come up with a much crueller death for him. - We're too late. - Yeah, the birds have flown. Something frightened them. Too bad. We were on the right track. We're right where we started. Unless they gave us the wrong address. No, this is the one, no doubt. - Bianchi. - Yes, what is it? What would you say this is? - I'd say it's metal. Lead or zinc. - But what does it mean? It means Yei Lin is testing the Sorensen formula. Now I'm certain that he or his men killed Prof. Sorensen. That much is clear. - Did you find out? - Yes, Master. They left that house and took a floor... in the tower in the center of the city. What did you find out? They've delivered many boxes branded with the name... of an electronics factory. The Sorensen formula. Yei Lin means to do some large-scale research. What shall we do, Master? We'll watch, and we'll wait. We must let them get set up and feel confident. Then they'll find out who Dr. Sat?n is. Why did you call me so urgently? We have news about the metal purveyors. One of them sold a large amount of zinc, lead and nickel... to a private individual. Could it have been a manufacturer? No, we checked. It must be for Yei Lin. And what about our other man? Nothing at all. It's as if the earth had swallowed him. Then we'll go there ourselves. - Marco's got news. - What is it now? Our enemies know we have settled in this place. - That could be dangerous! - Of course. But Marco's been watching them, and we know where they hide. What are your orders? Eliminate them before we start our large-scale experiments. Marco and I will take care of it. No. I'll do it myself. It'll be my pleasure. Zombies? Disgusting. Did you find what you were looking for? We meet again, Doctor. So it seems. Only this time you won't be so lucky. Perhaps. But who knows? Together, you and I would be invincible. You mean we'd share the secrets of the Sorensen formula? Exactly! That's what I propose! You overestimate yourself, Yei Lin. - Won't you consider my proposal? - No. My only mission is to take that formula from you... and to destroy you. And that's what I'll do. I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor. We would have been a great team. Come closer. Put me on the table. XX-38. It's in the safe. Quick. Inject me. Quick. Quick! Devil King! My lord and master... I need you! We must time it precisely. Three minutes of bombardment. Eastern Imports Inc. - Good evening, miss. - Good evening. What's that? Oh, Mr. Lin is testing some new equipment. It arrived just today from the East. Excuse me, miss, but I must investigate personally... just to see there are no safety threats to the building. As you wish, but... the test will be over in a moment. Take a seat, please. Thank you. Don't! It's still radioactive. I did it. I did it! It's gold! And having gold is like... like having the world in my hands! Look, Dea! - All this is gold. - It's wonderful! But... I had some problems outside. The guard was stubborn, so I had to take care of him. Dead? Pure gold, without a doubt. It's pure gold, Dea! Put him on the table. Cover your eyes, Dea. You can go blind. Our secret will be safe. Medusa. We have work to do. We have to repay Yei Lin's attentions. Command, and I'll obey, Master. Where am I? Who are you? - Answer me! - I will, miss. - You must be Dr. Sat?n. - Yes, I am. And you're Dea, Yei Lin's right hand woman. I'm just a mere servant. Don't try to deceive me. I know who you are. Why have you kidnapped me? Because I want the Sorensen formula... and the life of my enemy Yei Lin. We may be able to reach an understanding. That sounds interesting. I'm listening. In private. Okay. I like being on the winning side. Good for you. That's a very wise attitude. And I could be of great service to a man as powerful... and as pleasant as you. Let's talk about business first. And then, about some other things... Perhaps. What do you want from me? Call Yei Lin... and tell him that, if he wants to see you alive again... he must give me the Sorensen formula. If I do that, can I trust you? Can I trust you? Fine. I'll prove my loyalty to you. Hello? This is Dea. I'm being held prisoner by Dr. Sat?n. He says he'll kill me if you don't give him the formula. Your beautiful accomplice is telling the truth. How can I believe you? I know you want to kill me. All I care about now is the formula. As soon as I have it, I will give you Dea back. Alive. I want a guarantee. I need Dea, but I won't be tricked by you. No, no tricks. If you want to see her again... do exactly as I say. I'll be there. - No tricks. As promised. - So it would seem. I too have done my part. I trust you weren't foolish enough to give me a fake formula. No, Doctor. I know your power. I thought I'd killed you, and yet... Here you are, alive and well. That's right. Now, I want you to know I've injected Dea... with a very powerful venom. - Is that true? - It is. - Then you did trick me! - Wait a moment. That venom can be counteracted... if an antidote is given within 48 hours. What is that antidote? Speak! If the formula is real, I will tell you before that time. Fine, Dr. Sat?n. I gave you the formula, and I hope you'll soon give me the antidote. After that happens, we will meet again, Doctor. That's right, Yei Lin. The world is too small for both of us. Hello? Yes, it's me. Yeah, you delivered. The formula is correct. - What about the antidote? - The antidote? You don't need any antidote. Dea's injection was just water. Distilled water, to boot. See you soon, Yei Lin. See you soon, Dr. Sat?n. I'll take the pleasure of killing you with my own hands. - Have we been fooled? - No. We merely won a battle. I will win the war. - Did you give him the real formula? - Yes. Why? Then we are doomed. No. I made a small alteration to the atomic bombardment time. When he tries it, he won't stop the bombardment in time... and after two minutes... everything will be blown to pieces! - It's time. - We're right on time. - Go get the gold. - Right away. He must have an emergency shelter there. What will we do, Master? We'll keep an eye on them... and wait for the chance to get rid of Yei Lin. - We'll get closer to them? - Yes. With all due caution. This is Red Bird to Nest. Red Bird to Nest. - Red Bird to Nest. - This is Nest. Come in, Red Bird. Immediate report: Sorensen was a success. We can have all the metal we want. Repeat: Positive results. Metal, any amount at our disposal. Over. Report: Very satisfactory. Proceed in sending samples of metal. Over. The sample of the metal will go out through the south border. Any instructions for me? Over. Proceed to return. Everything will be settled by the usual means. Over. Understood. I'll destroy everything, as planned. Out. - I think they're pleased. - Quite. And with good reason! - The helicopter! - Right on time. We'll deliver the gold and leave as quickly as possible. Eveything is ready to blow up. Marco! Marco, come get the gold. They're almost here. Marco, can't you hear me? Marco can no longer obey you, honorable Yei Lin. - You again! - Yes. Me, all the time. Open that suitcase. You won't get away with this, Doctor. - You know what to do if they move. - Yes, Master. - Sorensen gold seems fine. - It is, Doctor. As fine as the finest. All the crimes you commited in order to get the formula... Was it personal greed? Or do you serve higher interests? An interesting puzzle for your great intellect to solve, Doctor. Too bad you won't be able to enjoy the results your efforts... because you will die, Yei Lin. Life is but a transit, Doctor. You know that. You can't die without your master's consent! And you can't live without serving others! Life is a constant act of service, Doctor. Now! Shoot! - I won once again. - Naturally. - Do we have to go inside? - Of course. We must make sure. Goodbye, Dr. Sat?n. It was a pleasure to fight an enemy like you. What about the gold? It's underneath all that! So what? We can have all the gold we want. Look! The helicopter is leaving! The cave's collapse must have startled them. - Wise of them to take no chances. - We'll have to explain this to Nest. Of course. We have the formula. It's a complete victory. Devil King! I heard your call, and here I am. Plutarco Sat?n! You have failed. Yei Lin is alive. He's cunning, my lord. But I'll fulfill your orders soon. You shall never have eternal rest. I curse you! No! Wait! Give me one last chance! If you haven't obtained the Sorensen formula... and killed Yei Lin by next full moon... you will know the full power of my wrath! You'll have the formula, and Yei Lin will die. Make it so. Here's to our triumph, and to you... beautiful as a lotus flower. Here's to you, the strongest and wisest of all men. - You are very kind. - I'm happy. Soon, you'll be the richest woman in the world. Whatever you want, you shall have just by saying the word. And you'll be the most powerful man in the world. Our future couldn't look better. Honorable sir, there's someone here to see you. Tell him I'm can't see him now. Teatime is sacred. He says he's a policeman. What are we going to do? We'll remain calm. Go tell the man I'll be honored to see him. Smile, please. You're much prettier that way. Good evening. Good evening, officer. May I ask why you honor my humble house with your visit? I'm sorry to disturb you... but INTERPOL Inspector Bianchi wants to see you. Have I commited a crime I'm not aware of? I don't know, sir. Tell the respectable Inspector I'll go to his office tomorrow. I'm afraid it has to be right now. Ah, I know. Orders are orders. Can I at least change clothes? I'm afraid that's not possible. You must come with me at once. I respect the law and its agents. I'm at your service. After you. Good job, darling. Thank you, my master. What shall we do with the body? We'll reunite him with his ancestors... after a convenient disintegration. When? After we've finished our tea. What a shame. That idiot stained my best carpet. We must get rid of him immediately. His superiors will send for him as soon as they notice his absence. You're beautiful and wise, Dea. We'll do as you say. But not before we've enjoyed our sacred beverage. - Good afternoon. - Hi, there. - Are you in charge of this office? - Can't you tell? - I'm sorry to interrupt your break. - Too late. What do you want? I'd like to rent a plane for a special trip. We don't have any. Would you mind asking the manager if there is a craft available? I told you we don't have any. Tell him that Red Bird sent me. It'll be a waste of both of our times. Yes, boss... Yes, boss. The boss says the plane will be ready by 9 p.m. Thank you. You are amazingly kind. What do you want? - Some minor reports. - You got the wrong office. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. What would you like to know, sir? Nothing much. All the arrangements are made. A plane will take us to the border. In two days, we'll be in the East, with the formula in our hands. I'll be relieved when we leave the country. - No news of him? - What news could there be? Dr. Sat?n is dead. And the dead don't talk, and don't haunt the living. I still can't believe it. That man was terrible. He seemed indestructible. Nobody can fight me and live to tell the tale. I know. Come on. We have work. We must destroy the equipment and get away from here. The police are closing in. We can't give them anything. - Yes, my master. - Let's go. 720 to HQ. 720 to HQ. Come in, 720. HQ is listening. The Easterner is in his office. I followed him from a building near the airport. Good. Don't let him out of your sight. We'll be over in ten minutes. We'll surround the whole block. Yei Lin will have to... perform a miracle if he expects to escape us this time. I'll give the general alarm. We'll go find Yei Lin and destroy him. I don't have much time. - Is he in the same building? - Yes, in his laboratory. Getting ready to leave the country. - Yei Lin will be wary. - Why should he? He thinks I'm dead. He has nothing to fear. He won't be expecting our visit. You're right as usual, my master. After tonight... the both of you will have eternal rest. No news. The man is still in his offices. Good. Everybody stand by. When we're ready, we'll get him. The microfilm will be easy to hide. Then, we'll destroy the book. I wonder what happened to the copy you gave Dr. Sat?n. - It must have perished with him. - What if it didn't? Then whoever finds it will get a huge surprise. Why do you say that? Remember, I put in an excess in the bombardment time of the metal. After 5 minutes of bombardment, the cannon becomes a nuclear bomb. A small one. Everything will blow up. You're right. It seems every risk is taken care of. Of course. When Yei Lin works, he works risk-free. All set, sirs. Not even a rat can escape our perimeter fence. Good. Let's go get him, then. Wait. We'll wait for a while. It seems Yei Lin has some very interesting visitors. It could be the other man we're looking for. Do you realize the power of science? This tiny film contains the whole Sorensen formula. Our bosses will have a right to be pleased with us. Of course! We're giving them all the gold in the world. Which means all the power. - Our reward will be huge. - And the thrill of a job well done. Of course. There are beautiful, long and peaceful days in our future. We'll use this timebomb to destroy the equipment. And now, let's get out of here. Could I have a small chat with you before you leave... honorable Yei Lin? - You! - In the flesh. No! That's impossible! I can assure you I'm no ghost. I'm just a man who's here to settle a score. Don't bother, Yei Lin. No black magic! Don't move! Don't think I won't shoot. You must go down. You must die! Damn you! Damn you! - Shouldn't we just go in? - No. I think we'd better wait for the visitors to come out. We'll take them quietly, and then we'll take Yei Lin. And now, you and me, honorable Yei Lin. Don't move. This is my pleasure. I intend to enjoy it with my own hands. The pleasure will be mine, as I destroy you with my own! Look out, master. I'm not an easy man to kill, Dr. Sat?n. You damned wizard! You'll only die when a wooden stake pierces your heart. Thank you... Devil King. I have carried out your orders. Our mission has been accomplished. You can rest now. Medusa, Erato... if the Devil King wishes, we'll soon meet in the Kingdom of Shadows. Won't you join us in eternal peace? Our lord and master has other plans. First, I must verify that the Sorensen formula works. Meet us soon, master. Only sixty more seconds. - We mustn't wait anymore. - Yeah, it's been a while. Let's get them. Alert the others. The End.
