Reporter: Several thousand Negro demonstrators are participating in this largest civil rights demonstration ever in Memphis, Tennessee. Today, as the march moves up towards city hall, Dr. Martin Luther King will speak to the striking workers and their sympathizers, now estimated somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000. Reporter: Chaos has just broken out downtown. Negro youths are smashing windows. Reporter: Well, chief, what is the condition of the city? Police chief: The city is under attack. Martin Luther King, jr.: Like anybody, I would like to live a long life, longevity has its place. Man: This is WMPS headline news at 8:25, Dick Weehan reporting, Washington. U.S. authorities have revealed a shortage of bombs in South Vietnam is curtailing air attacks on the Viet Cong. Reporter: The President has frequently interrupted his day-long conference on Vietnam problems to stay in close touch with the volatile racial disorders throughout the nation. King: The bombs in Vietnam exploded home. They destroyed the dream and possibility for a decent America. Lyndon B. Johnson: Let us close the springs of racial poison and make our nation whole. Reporter: The most massive series of demonstrations ever attempted is the promise of Dr. Martin Luther King, leader of a planned April Civil Disobedience Drive in Washington. Johnson: I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your President. King: I will die standing up for the freedom of my people! And they will know I spoke the truth. From Radio Memphis WMPS. ? W-M-P-S with the weather scoop! ? Here's the WMPS weather scoop for Memphis in the mid-South. Considerable cloudiness and mild with scattered showers through early Tuesday. Partly cloudy and continuing mild Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday. The low tonight, 55, the high Tuesday, 75, and the low Tuesday night, 50. Present barometric pressure, 29.7. This is Ray Sherman, United Press International in Memphis. 1,000 striking sanitation workers demanded Mayor Henry Loeb hear their grievances. The garbage collectors, predominantly Negro, want higher pay and Union recognition. James Lawson: We are insisting that justice must be done for the sanitation workers. All their just and fair demands must be met. And that at the same time, both private business and city government must provide a greater percentage of new and important jobs to Negroes. Henry Loeb: This work stoppage directly affects the public health. Let no one make a mistake about it, the garbage is going to be picked up in Memphis. PJ Ciampa: I recognize Local 1733 as the bargaining representative for employees designating exclusive or otherwise. He doesn't want to recognize the Union. Reporter: The Memphis chapter of the NAACP says the Civil Rights Group will begin protest actions Monday unless the city meets demands of striking garbage collectors. Reporter: Police used riot control gas and nightsticks this afternoon to break up a disturbance among a group of striking garbage men. Part of the group of about 1,000 marchers began rocking a police car, and police waded in. Man: If I were the Mayor of this city, I would be ashamed. Roy Wilkins: Anybody who runs around picking on peaceful people is building for trouble. [Applause] Lawson: We probably cannot expect protection of Negro people from brutality and from repression locally. The ear and the power outside of the city of Memphis. Reporter: Dr. Martin Luther King has urged the Memphis Negro community to engage in a general work stoppage and school boycott in support of the city's striking sanitation workers. King: So I come to commend you, and I come also to say to you that in this struggle you have the absolute support, and that means financial support, also, of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. [Applause] All over America, the vast majority of Negroes in our country are still perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. And it is criminal to have people working a full-time job getting part-time income. [Applause] Loeb: If the men do not return to work immediately, we will have no choice but to employ others to protect the public health. This is Ray Sherman on the scene. Several thousand Negro demonstrators are participating In this largest civil rights demonstration ever in Memphis, Tennessee. This massive downtown march on Memphis is now under way. Several thousand Negroes are marching toward City Hall at this time. Many of the demonstrators are carrying the sign "I am a man." They stretch out for several blocks. Later today as the march moves up towards City Hall, Dr. Martin Luther King will speak to the striking workers and their sympathizers, now estimated somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000. Police are on hand with about 600 officers. Almost the entire force is standing by here in case any trouble might break out. Chaos has just broken out downtown. Negro youths are smashing windows. I just saw a... [Loud bang] That sound you just heard was the sound of a tear gas fired by a police officer in an attempt to thwart this unruly demonstration. We repeat, several Negro youths started running down Main Street, smashing windows as they ran. Police are now moving down Beale Street. Another tear gas canister has just been fired by Memphis police. Negroes are running in every direction. Probably some more glass wreckage in the downtown section of Memphis. Tear gas is boiling up from the street, And the Negro youths are fleeing from the area. Police are scrambling down beale street now. There's been a call of help from other officers. Officers are in trouble. The Negro youths are shouting at this time, "Go, go, go!" Police have formed a cordon and are not permitting the march to move any further at this point. They are moving in with riot guns and tear gas canisters. Here comes the tear gas, and this reporter just got a sting of it. Main street is littered with pickets. Nearly every store has had its windows shattered. No doubt, one of the worst disturbances that have ever occurred in Memphis. This is Ray Sherman on the scene again. [Loud bang] There went another tear gas canister. Some youths are still hurling objects at officers. Police now have cordoned off the area around Clayborn Temple, where this massive demonstration that went wild and crazy began earlier today. Many of the negro demonstrators have taken refuge inside the church from the tear gas that still fills the air. And inside the leaders are appealing to the Negro youths and militants to stop and desist from this disorder and violence that has occurred in Memphis. Lawson: You obviously had a group of boys who were ready to do that, and they did it. They didn't come to the march. They didn't consult us. They are outside of our control absolutely, always have been. And this time they got their chance to break loose, and they took it. Sherman: What happened with Dr. King? Lawson: Well, we surrounded him with some ministers and moved him out of the area. Sherman: In an undisclosed location? Lawson: Yeah. Sherman: Do you think this event today will have any effect on the city government taking any different type of action than they have on the strike? Man: Oh, you can't allow this sort of terror and disruption to go on in a city like ours. You can be sure it will have an effect. Loeb: When the march, which was to be permitted, had it remained orderly, degenerated into a riot, abandoned by its leaders, the police, with my full sanction, took the necessary action to protect the lives and property of the citizens of Memphis. It is hereby ordered and invoked a curfew, which requires all citizens to be off the streets of the city of Memphis by 7:00 p.m. tonight and remain off the streets until 5:00 a.m. Persons on the streets during these hours who do not have legitimate business or emergency reasons will be subject to arrest. What needs to be done will be done. Claude Armour: There will be 4,000 troops in this city by 6:00 p.m., and the governor's message is that He is going to maintain law and order. We should not let fear get the best of us. And we're going to stop this thing and see that peace comes back to this community. Reporter: These troops are armed, are they carrying ammunition? General: Uh, yes. They will protect themselves, of course. If the situation demands it, they will return the fire. Reporter: General, do you have any idea of what the cost is of this operation to the taxpayers of Tennessee? General: No, I'd be afraid to make a guess offhand. It's no small cost. 4,000 National Guardsmen into the city. He's also ordered 200 riot-trained state patrolmen to Memphis and has placed an additional 8,000 guardsmen on standby alert at armories near Memphis. Henry Lux: The National Guard has been called in. We have had looting and burning, and several police officers have been hurt. We're trying to get it under control at this time. But at this time, it's spreading. Reporter: Was it spontaneous or planned? Coby Smith: Well, it was very much spontaneous. I think we better go on record as saying, anyway. Reporter: You mean it was not spontaneous, but on the record you want to say it's spontaneous? Smith: I think we'll just let these problems just iron themselves out, however people want to take it. Black people are tired. Reporter: Your group had nothing to do, then, with trying to take over Dr. King's march yesterday? Smith: Well, I can't actually say concretely whether we--we're glad to see the city of Memphis wake up to reality. King: I must honestly say that demonstration here yesterday was something that I had no part in planning. I was invited here by the leadership to take part, and we came cold. We didn't know all of the factors involved. I came here to make a speech two weeks ago, as some 15,000 people assembled. And I assumed that some of the ideological struggles that we find in most cities over the nation, particularly in the north, were non-existent here. Riots are here. Riots are a part of the ugly atmosphere of our society now. I would rather put my time and place my energy Into getting rid of these conditions, because as long as they're here, they're going to produce angry people. Lux: We're still having isolated incidents of vandalism and some fires, but certainly there is a tremendous decrease. And I think this is due in part to the guard men present and heavier patrols. King: I'm convinced that non-violence is the way, And that violence is not the answer. Reporter: Does that mean there will be no more violence in Memphis? King: well, I can't guarantee and go to Washington. I'm simply saying that we are going to have a non-violent demonstration here. Reporter: Dr. King, what are your plans? King: I will be leaving Memphis later today, going back to Atlanta. And my next step would be to come back to Memphis, And that, we hope, can take place in the next two or three days. Reporter: Dr. King... King: We've got to give ourselves to this struggle Until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. I want to thank God once more for allowing me to be here with you. I left Atlanta this morning, and then I got into Memphis. And some began to say the threats or talk about the threats that were out. Or what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. [Cheering] And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life, longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do god's will, and he's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over, And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! [Cheering] So I'm happy tonight, I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord! [Applause] [Gunshot] Reporter: Memphis Police report they have just confirmed that Reverend Martin Luther King has been shot. Dr. Martin Luther King, according to what one of his aides told this reporter, was standing on a balcony. Man: In the motel room, getting ready to go to dinner. He was going to my house for dinner, as a matter of fact. Jesse Jackson: And so I said, "Doctor, are you ready to go?" And he said, "Yes, Jesse. Let's get ready to go right now." Reporter: You did hear a shot? Man: We heard what sounded just like a firecracker, a loud, a real loud shot. Jackson: I said, "Dr. King," and that was it. And the bullet exploded in his face. Man: He had fallen backwards, and I heard somebody holler, "Oh, Lord!" Jackson: The bullet knocked him up off of his feet in that direction against that ledge over there. Reporter: Did Dr. King say anything? Man: He didn't say anything, he just-- He didn't say anything at all. Sherman: It's a hectic scene tonight. A bullet struck Dr. King in the back of the neck. He was rushed to St. Joseph Hospital in critical condition. [Siren] Man: Dr. Martin Luther King was received in the emergency room at St. Joseph Hospital at approximately 6:15 p.m. Nurse: Well, I just was told that he had been shot. The report I got was in the shoulder. It was serious. That's what I got from Reverend Andrew Young. Man: He is in the emergency room, and he is in critical condition. Man: And there was 20 or 30 doctors, and they tried external heart massage, and his respiration muscles were paralyzed, and everything else was paralyzed, and he had lost all his sensations. He still didn't have any blood. You have to understand, really a massive wound. I've never seen a wound like this. 7:05 p.m., April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was pronounced dead. Reporter: Do you attribute this to the violence that occurred last week? Or do you think that this is a continuation of it? Man: I just have no, no idea why anybody would want to shoot Dr. King. Jackson: God knows this is the most tragic thing that has ever happened in my life. Lawson: I cannot in any way try to describe to you the pain and the shock that I feel on this very dreary moment in the life of this city, and in the life of this nation, and in my own personal life. Jackson: The pathology and the sickness and the neurosis of Memphis and of this racist society in which we live is that that really pulled the trigger. To some extent Dr. King has been a buffer the last two years between the Black community and the White community. The White people do not know it, but the White people's best friend is dead. Robert F. Kennedy: I have some very sad news for all of you. Could you lower those signs, please? I have some very sad news for all of you. And I think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world. And that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis. [Screams] What we need in the United States is not division. What we need in the United States is not hatred. What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another. And a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country. My name is Ben Hooks. I knew Dr. King personally and intimately. I loved him as I would have loved a brother. And so I call on all of our friends here in Memphis to stay in your homes tonight. And rather than break windows or shoot or hate, go on your knees and pray to God that we might live for the things for which Martin Luther King, jr., died. Reporter: In Memphis, the manhunt continues. Police are looking for a young, well-dressed man seen leaving a brick building across the street from the Lorraine Hotel. William Morris: It's believed by the Memphis Police Department, Mr. Holloman, Chief McDonald, Director Armour, and myself that an emergency situation does exist, and at this time, we are asking that all people of Memphis and Shelby County observe as we put into effect our curfew, we request that all persons, unless it is absolutely an emergency to be on the street, to go to their homes and stay there until tomorrow when things hopefully will be in a better situation. Reporter: Well, Chief, what is the condition of the city? Police Chief: The city is under attack. This is John True, United Press International, Memphis. Police and fire department companies are scrambling in answer to reports of sporadic outbreaks of looting, fires and an occasional sniper fire. Two policemen have been shot. National Guard troops and highway patrolmen are being called in. A curfew is in effect in the city tonight and only emergency traffic is being allowed. Reporter: The President has turned his full attention to domestic matters, particularly the violence spawned by the death of Dr. Martin Luther King. Man: The Governor made the following statement, "I most earnestly ask the people of Memphis and Shelby County to remain calm in face of this most regrettable and tragic incident. I can fully appreciate the feelings and emotion which this tragic occurrence has aroused. But for the benefit of everyone, all of our citizens must exercise restraint and caution and good judgment at this time." Reporter: President Johnson has canceled his trip to Honolulu for a Vietnam Strategy conference with Commanding General William Westmoreland and others. Here in Washington, the D.C. National Guard troops have been called for active duty for the weekend as fires and other outbreaks of disorder continue to plague the nation's capital. Demonstrations are in progress across the street right now from the White House. Reporter: Widespread violence and looting broke out in two areas of New York city tonight. Extra police were being rushed into the two largest ghettos in the city-- Harlem and Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section. Reporter: 3,000 National Guardsmen are on the street in Chicago tonight. At least three persons are dead and possibly a fourth. Reporter: Students enraged by the sniper slaying of Martin Luther King went on a shooting and burning rampage here at Tallahassee early this morning. Reporter: Demonstrators in the Times Square section stood on street corners chanting, "Who died for freedom? Dr. Martin Luther King." Reporter: The racial violence has struck the windy city. Fires are blazing out of control on the west side and over it all, the stench of fear. Reporter: Pope Paul is profoundly saddened by the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. The Pope went to his private chapel to pray for the Negro leader as soon as he learned of his death. Man: Well, the only thing I can say is I wish we would quit shooting our best people. Man: We killed a President, and now we killed a saint. Man: It does not bode well for 1968. Ralph Abernathy: Every well-thinking American citizen ought to be concerned about who killed Martin Luther King. But I am not as concerned about who killed Martin Luther King as I am concerned about what killed Martin Luther King. [Applause] Reporter: Nationwide, slum rioting has claimed more than 30 lives, and damage is running into countless millions. Reporter: Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb has declared Friday, Saturday and Sunday to be days of community mourning in Memphis. Flags will be flown at half-mast during this time. Reporter: Police are still seeking the young White man who assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King, jr., Thursday night at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis. Reporter: Mr. Holloman, are you holding a suspect right now, sir? Frank Holloman: No, sir. Reporter: Do you have a material witness, sir? Holloman: No, sir. Holloman: There was 25 to 30 officers in the immediate area. The protection was so close that one of the officers actually saw Dr. King when he was struck by the bullet. It would have been impossible to have prevented a sniper assassin to have accomplished his purpose. Reporter: How could he get away with so many men in the area? Holloman: That's the question that we are trying to establish at this time. The Attorney General offered his complete assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this crime. Reporter: President Johnson, with his Honolulu high-level conference held in abeyance by the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King, will meet with unspecified Civil Rights leaders today at the White House. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ramsey Clark and three other Federal Officials have flown to Memphis. Ramsey Clark: We have no evidence that there was a widespread plot. The evidence at this time indicates that it was the act of a single individual. There are a number of items of physical evidence, more than you ordinarily have in a crime and a situation of this type at this time in an investigation. The gun itself and the projectile are in Washington, and they are under laboratory scrutiny at this time. That's all I can say on that subject. Your investigation is spreading? How far away from Tennessee? Clark: It will spread as far as the evidence takes us, and it has spread some several hundred miles from the borders of Tennessee at this time. Reporter: Police in Memphis remain mum on their investigation of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Here is what police know but say little about-- They are seeking a 30-year-old White man who spoke with a Southern drawl who called himself John Willard. There are indications authorities already know his real name. In a related development, a 20-year-old Memphis Negro youth died early today and became the city's first victim of the Thursday night rioting in Memphis touched off by the assassination of Dr. King. Scott Peters, United Press International, the White House. President Johnson was briefed this morning at 4:00 a.m. and again at 6:30 on the situation surrounding the rioting and looting since Thursday night. Washington looks like a city at war, and it is. There are something like 4,000 troops in the city and tanks rumble through the streets. A machine gun post was set up on capitol hill. Black smoke can be seen billowing into the air in many parts of northwest Washington, some of the trouble just three blocks from the white house. President Johnson has issued a proclamation declaring this Sunday as a national day of mourning throughout America. Man: We implore our Mayor and City Council to address themselves with swift dispatch to the mutually acceptable solution. We are persuaded that only when a spirit of flexibility and goodwill dominates can true peace and progress come to our city. Man: Mr. Honorable Mayor, I feel deeply that the apostle, the greatest apostle of peace in this decade, this age, has died. I feel that if any constructive and stabilizing forces are to come on the scene, it will have to come from our White brother, you. And it is in this spirit that you can speak most effectively and constructively. Man: You're a human being, too, and somehow we've got to communicate to you as a man. Man: Mr. Mayor, this is the third time I've come to you pleading. If we had been able to get a hearing as ministers of the Black community, we never would have needed to send for king or anybody else. Clark: When Mrs. King arrived, we met with her briefly on the airplane. We expressed for the President, for our government, for ourselves, and the nation, our profound sorrow. Reporter: They are now slowly rolling the gold casket containing the body of Dr. Martin Luther King into the chartered airplane sent to Memphis by Senator Robert Kennedy. Police here have had a difficult time controlling the crowds that have gathered around the plane. The funeral will be Tuesday. Dr. King's planned march in Memphis Monday will be carried out. Reverend Ralph Abernathy, who's destined to become the new leader of Dr. King's Southern Leadership conference, has announced we will return Monday. Reporter: The body of Dr. Martin Luther King has been returned to his home city of Atlanta. Reporter: It's a gray, overcast day here in Memphis as thousands of the city's Negroes gather to march in the interrupted sanitation men's demonstration. Reporter: The march is running a bit later than planned due to the late arrival of Mrs. King who was held up in Atlanta's Airport because of fog. Reporter: It seems like it is 10 minutes to 11:00, and the march is just about ready to get under way. It's an extremely large crowd. Reporter: Leading the procession, the widow of the late Dr. Martin Luther King and her three children, the Reverend Ralph Abernathy-- Dr. King's successor, Harry Belafonte, United Auto Workers' President Walter Reuther, and other Union leaders. The number of marchers, previously estimated between 8,000 to 15,000 by various sources, may be closer to 30,000 or 40,000. Reporter: Local police have provided the tightest security measures Ever imposed on the city. Off they step now, black and white, out here today, Because their leader had a dream they intend to make real. Reporter: They walk in total silence. An almost an unbelievable eerie quiet. Harry Belafonte: And I've come to reaffirm that I am as more committed today to the causes of human dignity as a Black man who draws strength from a departed Black brother. Walter Reuther: The whitest American cannot be free until he gives his hand to the blackest American to make him free. Coretta Scott King: We loved him dearly. I have always been at his side When I felt that he needed me. And so today I felt that he would have wanted me to be here. John Chambers, United Press International, on Capitol Hill. While Martin Luther King's funeral procession filed through the streets of Atlanta, the House Rules Committee sent the 1968 Civil Rights Bill to the floor for action. That could come tomorrow. Scott Peters, United Press International, the White House. President Johnson has signed the Civil Rights Bill of 1968. Johnson: Now with this Bill, the voice of justice speaks again. Reporter: In an east room ceremony, the President made the bill, with its controversial fair housing section, the law of the land. Man: The city of Memphis recognizes the American federation of state, county and municipal employees as a designated representative in the division of public works. Man: Go ahead, Brother Jones, take the vote. T.O. Jones: All in favor of the recommendation, let it be known by saying "Aye." All: Aye. [Applause] Lawson: And we're not going to let-- I am telling you now on the behalf of these preachers-- We're not going to forget the fact that we're bound by the blood of Martin Luther King as well as by the sweat and toil that we've all given. Reporter: The Justice Department has announced that James Earl Ray, the accused assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, has been arrested in London, England. It was said that Ray's arrest was the result of investigation by the FBI pursued in all 50 states as well as in Canada, Mexico, Portugal, England, and other countries. Hoover said that Ray was detained in England based on issues of fraudulent documentation of passport, and also on the fact that he was carrying a concealed weapon. Loeb: The citizens of Memphis are elated over the apprehension of James Earl Ray. And that's our duty, it'll be a privilege to carry it out. Lawson: I think it needs to be said clearly, that so far as the Black community is concerned in Memphis, many of us question the idea that only one man was involved. Knowing, as an example, how efficiently our police can block off would-be bank robbers from getting out of the city, we'd like to know how one man committed a crime, with the police on the scene within two minutes, could nonetheless get out of the city by himself. Reporter: Do you feel that James Earl Ray could have planned this thing and executed and done it completely by himself? Man: I think so. My position is that we have no evidence of a conspiracy. There are several indications in his background that he was anti-Negro and anti-Semitic. Ted Kennedy: To some, this is a day of sorrow. To some, this is an occasion for fear. To me, this is a day of hope. And if the lives and deaths of Dr. King and Medgar Evers and those four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham had any meaning, it was that we should use our power not to create conditions of oppression that lead to violence, but conditions of hope that lead to peace. Let us pray as Dr. King prayed in the universal psalm of brotherhood that meant so much to him and to you and to all of us and that should be the prayer of this, this holy day. If we can help somebody as we pass along, if we can cheer somebody in this life, if we can show somebody that he's traveling wrong, then our lives shall not be in vain. [Applause]
