MALE CASTING DIRECTOR: Well, you tell that cocksucker that the offer is off the table at 6 o'clock tonight - --at 6 o'clock. Bus comes, yeah, at 3 o'clock. MALE CASTING DIRECTOR: Yeah, you can call me. FEMALE CASTING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much. MALE CASTING DIRECTOR: I'm going to be here all fucking day. Stefanie will see you out. Goodbye. Yeah. Thank you. T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U. [chatter] Max, good to see you! Tony, what's going on, buddy? Hey! You get home all right that night? Yeah, why? You seemed upset and quiet. Oh. No, I just had a few beers, and, you know. I went home, I slept it off. - How is the play going? - Pretty good. I'm going to try to come again tonight. [pager beeping] And try to bring Lisa. Hey, it would be real good to see her. I gotta go look all these over, whew! Yeah, OK. Tony? They're only reading the first scene in there. They want an exact time? [sighing] Thanks, man. Yeah. [music playing] IRA GOLDSTEIN: Hey! I paged you. I know. Did I get it? No, we didn't, kid, not this one. Any feedback? Eh, you thought you had Andy Garcia quality, but you lack the John Goodman, and they wanted taller. Nothing. Like, nothing about my work? No. I could have gained the weight. What about today's audition? Five minutes of their time, Ira. I mean, five minutes of their time-- I don't think it's too much to ask. OK look, what you can do is you can just go in there and do your best. I drove my ass to the center of hell. Come on, it was Northridge actually. They acted like I wasn't even there. Well, they're assholes. Those are assholes, Maxie. We're in this for the long haul. I prepared four scenes, just like they asked, Ira. Good boy. And I get there, and they tell me to read only one. Jeez, that's terrible. That's terrible! I mean, that's a little late, don't you think? I don't get it. I just don't get it. You're perfect for the role. They need to learn some respect. I mean, I should have told them. I should have told them. I should have told them to fuck off. How about a bowl of soup, huh? IRA GOLDSTEIN: Come on, it was Northridge actually. MAX MATTEO: They treat me like I wasn't even there. IRA GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but those are assholes. [car horns] [continued honking] [engine turning] Could you please stop honking your fucking horn? [glass shattering] [honking] Asshole! [police sirens] [phone ringing] Hello? No, no, no. I'm sorry. Max-- Max doesn't live here anymore. OK, bye. [beeping] FEMALE SPEAKER (ON MACHINE): Hello, Mr. Matteo. This is Rosalyn from FC&P. It is imperative that you call us immediately regarding your account at 1-800-555-0109. Anyone here can help you. Thank you. [phone ringing] Hello, [inaudible]. Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty. MAX (ON MACHINE): Hi, this is Max. If you leave me a message, I'll get right back to you. Come on! MAX (ON MACHINE): Bye. IRA (ON MACHINE): Maxy, it's Ira. You there? Pick up. Yeah, it's me, Ira. IRA (ON PHONE): I just got the call. They want to see you again on "Final Rights." Oh, yes! Your inner monologue might have taken over the event of that first line. When you came out on that stage, brother, I could-- I felt it. You-- you-- I would have liked if you would have taken her in a little bit more. Let it breathe a little bit. No obligation to the script, you know that. What was that first line? Hello. There's a lot going on there, man. Next up is John Fiorentino. [italian singing] Come here, [inaudible]. Come on! [inaudible] - Look at this. You look good. Look at this mug over here, huh? Is that a mug? Thank god you got your mom's looks, not my primate brothers. Come on, let's go get the rest of the [inaudible].. You're out, Max. Maybe I can help. I never thought you were a bad consigliere. I thought your brother was a bad don. Rest in peace. This [inaudible] owes an apology. An apology! You think I give a shit what he thinks? His time has come, and so has mine. I say we move in now before someone else does. READER: Vinny, sorry to bother you, but there's a call for you. I don't give a fu-- I'm in a meeting, for fuck's sakes! Who is it. READER: It's your daughter. Hi, sweetheart. No, Daddy did not forget your birthday. Daddy loves you too much to forget your birthday. I love you too. I just made up my mind while I was talking to my little girl, and I want that son of a bitch dead. Tonight. Life is too fucking short. [music playing] [large audience applause] [smaller audience clapping] Hey. You were terrific. Did the second act work? I got it. I got the part. What part? The Bruce Willis movie! I got the Bruce Willis movie! - No way! Yes! Oh my god! Oh my god! When do you start? Um-- Oh, a week. My god, I should start dieting. This is, uh, Dayton. This is Max. - Hey. Hey. [inaudible] Oh, great. Great, thanks. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Oh, I'm so proud of you! JULIET (VOICEOVER): I got the part. MAX (VOICEOVER): What part? JULIET (VOICEOVER): The Bruce Willis movie. I got the Bruce Willis movie! MAX (VOICEOVER): No way! Yes! Oh my god! Oh! [music playing] It's very inappropriate, Tom. I was sort of hoping you were going to airbrush the bags under my eyes. OK. Well, when would be an appropriate time, then? You can see right there. You can do that, right? Tad, come on. This is the fifth time we've done your shot. If we airbrush it any more, you're going to look a little China doll. - Excuse me. - Wait. Hold on. Are you-- what, are you joking about my headshot? This is like the Michael Jackson of headshots right now. Look at you. --synonymous with manipulation! I'm just saying if-- the bags give you a little character. Character? No, no, no. Stop that train right there. Let me tell you something. For those of us that are working actors, I'm a leading man, OK? I don't-- I don't want any character, you understand? Character is-- bags is unemployment for me. Can I-- just pick up my pictures? Because they're already paid-- Who are you? Max Matteo. Give me a minute with this guy, all right? Hold on, Max. Let me ask you, Mike. So, you see those bags, right? Eight years of my life, you ungrateful fuck. Oh, now, there's a fucking character for you. Yeah. That's not-- a whole different thing. Can I have my phone back? I'm-- hello, who's in line here? What the fuck? Get a number system, pal. This is nuts. JODIE (VOICEOVER): "Final Rights" casting. IRA (VOICEOVER): Hey, Jodie. Ira Goldstein here. JODIE (VOICEOVER): Ira, before we get into it, I want you to know that I really like Max, he did a wonderful reading for us yesterday, it's just not going any further unfortunately. IRA (VOICEOVER): Well, can I ask why? JODIE (VOICEOVER): Well, to be honest, our producer has a nephew, and he's, um, pretty good, actually. IRA (VOICEOVER): You're out, Max. Come on, honey. Hurry up. Let's go. [gun clicking] [gunshot] You ever think about what we're doing out here, how fast time is going by? I try not to. Why? You living in denial? I just don't dwell on it, that's all. Yeah, well, there's dwelling on it, and then there's not dealing with it. Sometimes I think about marriage. Kids, family, sacrifices I made. Most guys my age are set up by now. I don't need to be rich, you know? But I just want to work. This is humiliating. Hey, remember the opening of "Star Wars"? There was a mob scene outside. We wanted to get in, but it was sold out. People were coming out of the first show. What did we do? We walked in backwards. Fucking right, we did. We found a way, and we're going to find a way again. We were 9. It'll happen. I just got the news this morning. Get this-- five weeks in San Francisco, three weeks in Chicago. Eight weeks? Can I get another shot? Get to go home a man. So when do you start? Three days. Soon. Our first rehearsals are at noon. WOMAN: You get to kiss Meryl Streep? MAN: It's unbelievable! WOMAN: I would kill to work with Meryl Streep. MAX (VOICEOVER): I think it's about luck, and maybe I just don't have any. [tv chatter] WOMAN (ON TV): Jack Lemmon! [applause from tv] [tape rewinding] WOMAN (ON TV): Jack Lemmon! [applause from tv] [knocking] Hey. My god. - Can you believe it? - No. What the hell happened? I can't fucking believe it. I broke it! How? That fucker on the boardwalk in Venice. That fucking unicyclist. You start shooting tomorrow. My god! [sobbing] Oh, shit! Ow! God damn it! God. Just [inaudible]. I'm sorry. Oh. Here. All right. It's going to be OK. It's not going to be OK. I think I'm going to move back to Boston. What? Come on. You can't leave me out here alone, huh? Fight the good fight by myself? You'll get another break. I promise. It took me four years to get this one, OK? And by the time this thing heals, I'm going to be all the way back to nobody. Fuck it. Look, you-- you can't just give up. I'm not doing it all over again. I am not. I am not humiliating myself all over again. I mean, you give everything. You give everything to this business, and at the end of the day, you can count on nothing. I was struck down by a fucking unicyclist. Can I have a glass of water? Yeah, water. And when I'm famous, I'm gonna put you in all my movies, I swear. Hon, don't you think it's time that you be a bit more realistic? What do you mean? I mean, how old are you? I mean, if it was going to happen for you, it would have happened by now. You know what I mean? I'm just looking out after you, Max. I mean, really, how much more of your life do you want to spend in acting class, barking like a dog? You really think people get work that way? Hey, if you want to quit, then quit. Don't expect me to, OK? It's not fair. I didn't mean it. Because you know what? The truth is, I so hope you make it. I really, really do. But I have got to go home. I can't take it. I'm sick of it. I'm fucking sick of it. If I have to wait for my agent to call me back one more fucking time, I'll kill myself. And it's-- you know, it's so much easier for you guys. I've got to worry about if my boobs are big enough. I've got to worry if my butt is small enough. I mean, you've got to be cute and talented all at the same time. It's terrible. You've got to look like you're a fucking Victoria's Secret model and be Meryl Streep at the same time. That's not easy. And it's fucking tiring. It's tiring. Do you want to be the first one to sign my cast? [music playing] Max Matey-a? Tie. Max Matey-- Matteo. Max Matteo. OK. [inaudible] [inaudible]. And we got the foreign territories covered. What, you think so? Domestically, of course, he's not worth shit. But he's got that terrible TV show that plays in every language all over the world. I would have gone with that Matteo. I think Bob feels the same way too, you know. MAN: Fuck Bob. What does he know? He's lucky to be directing this movie. No, if you go with Matteo, you've got to build a cast around him. With Inglewood, well, you're set to go. Well, so we build the cast around Matteo. The priest is an important role, you know. I'll tell you what. Whoever pisses the longest gets their choice. OK. I get Inglewood, you get Matteo. I guess that's fair. Shit. No, I'm done. And I'm done. Well, my good fella, Inglewood it is. You've seen the body of that redhead? Oh, I ride High Road just to look at her every day. All right. Everybody make a nice, deep sound. ALL: Ah! Good. Good, deal with how you're feeling right now. Talk to me. I feel angry. Angry, good. What else? What else? Aw! I'm tired of taking care of you. Leave me alone! Breathe. I can't. Leave me alone! Breathe! Breathe. That's going to be very precise. Exercise those senses. I'm a seagull! I'm a seagull! Yes, you are. IRA (VOICEOVER): You lack the John Goodman, and they wanted taller. Max, you seem very guarded today. JULIET (VOICEOVER): If it was going to happen for you, it would have happened by now. Make a sharp sound. Huh! OK. OK, what text are you working on? Um, Edmund, "King Lear." How do you feel? Uh-- Start the monologue. Thou, nature, art my goddess. To thy law my services are bound. Wherefore should I stand in the plague of-- You're very disconnected. I-- I gotta get some air. ALL: Ah! Whatever you are feeling, it is appropriate. Everybody, sound. ALL: Ah! MAN (VOICEOVER): Whoever pisses the longest gets their choice. I get Inglewood, you get Matteo. MAN (VOICEOVER): All right. That's fair. MAN (VOICEOVER): OK. EJ Inglewood? Yeah? [groaning] What the hell is your problem? I've seen you in something! God! Oh! God damn you, I have a shoot tomorrow. [gunfire] [inaudible] You'll never work in this town again! Bastard! I know people! [shouting] [car smashing] [water running] The bold and the ridiculous-- my wife thinks he's the cat's meow. My daughter watches the show. Terrible fucking actor. Your wife probably watches the show. My wife watches my kids. Looks like he's on his way to the gym. Way back. Back? [inaudible]. Stalker? If there was a female, she's got one hell of a sling. Everybody's talking about you, man. What do you mean? Max Matteo is hot. "Secret Scruples," you got that, right? Yes, I did. Congratulations, Max. You're on a roll. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm waiting to hear something myself. What is it? I don't want to jinx it. Hey, Max. They're ready for you. MAX: OK. Max Matteo. Max Matteo, it's good to see you. - Good to see you too, Bob. - Yeah. OK. So can you stand right up here? Max, you're going to play to this mark here for Billy. You're going to play to this mark here for Sharon. And we shoot down in Mexico for Billy insurance coverage. We'll have the beach in the background, all right? Where-- where are Billy and Sharon. Just play it to the marks, all right? OK. [inaudible] Roll sound. And action. It is not my practice to tell you what to do, but I will tell you this. If you will look to God for guidance, it is a very good start. MAN: But we're so confused, Father. If you would pray, it would quiet the mind, and you will hear the voice of God. The answer, it is within you. But if I'm first choice, then there's no other higher choices. So it's mine. I mean, is there-- is there a zero choice or a minus one choice? Well, why don't they just offer me the role, then? Oh, Christ. I mean, can't I just get an offer like everybody else? [sighing] Betty-- yeah. You know, I'm-- all right, all right. Yeah, I'll be OK. All right, bye. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Talk to you later. Thanks, Marty. Screen Actors Guild. Jimmy Stewart had one of these. Spill it. What's your hunch? Hunch doesn't mean much without motive. Hey, Lisa! Your agent just called, and it's official. I'm dating a waiter. [music playing] Afternoon. [inaudible]. I'm Detective Sanchez. This is Detective Coyle. What's your name, sir? Jimmy. We understand a Mr. EJ Inglewood used to frequent this bar. He'd drop in after work. Did he have any trouble recently? Anybody that might want to hurt him? Not that I can see. Never liked the guy. At least he died with a career. Excuse me? Hey, hey. He's had a few drinks. He's not a problem. He just lost his girlfriend. Let's go. Did you know Mr. EJ Inglewood? Sure. He was on TV. Everyone knows you when you're on TV, huh? He was a household name. I mean, really. Hey, do me a favor, huh? Burn this. I ain't no EJ Inglewood, lucky bastard. That lucky bastard, he got to go out on top. Jimmy. Call Mr. Felice a cab, please. He'll pick up his keys tomorrow. - Oh, no. Let's get some air, sir. Sir. Sir! I'm Tony Felice! Who the fuck are you? - OK, pal. Easy does it. Let's get you home. Hey, Jimmy! See ya, Tony. [music playing] [engines revving] [tires squealing] I hear you. You know, I hear you, but I don't care. I don't care. I don't give a fuck if the director was his mother. We're not going to settle for anything less than a 45-foot pop out with two cell phones. I mean, come on, Joel. How is the guy supposed to stay in character between scenes? How is he supposed to-- how is he supposed to-- no. No, n-- did I give you Julia? Yeah. So how about you get this for me? All right. Now you call me back, thanks. Sorry about that, guys. Just one second. OK, um-- - Inglewood, ma'am. Your client-- who else would have known about him doing the film besides yourself and this agency? The producers and casting, I would guess. They told me a few days after his death that he was going to get the part. It wasn't public information yet. Who ended up doing his role? Fuck. Jenny, who ultimately ended up playing the priest in "Secret Scruples"? JENNY (ON INTERCOM): Max Matteo. She doesn't forget a thing, this girl. Well, thank you for your time. If we have any further questions, we'll be in touch. My assistant will show you out. You know, I hope you catch that bastard. EJ was a good earner. Nobody ever went hungry when he was around. Yes, ma'am. Jenny, get me Brad on the line and that cocksucker doing the eight is-- who is-- why are we remaking "Eight Is Enough"? [music playing] Vodka, straight up, please. Hey, Max. Barry Daniels. Don't act so stunned. This isn't Ellis Island. So you're a player now? Excuse me? Well, you're here, not parking cars. WOMAN: Stole my idea in a pitch meeting! MAN: Asshole. WOMAN: [inaudible]. He will not have sex without putting two condoms on. He says he's not going out like that. I think that ecstasy is starting to kick in. WOMAN: I haven't seen an uncircumcised penis in this town. Hey, daddy-o. What's going on? - I just got here. Oh, yeah. You want a grape or something? No. What kind of cheese is that? I don't know. It's some kind of Sicilian maggot cheese or something. I'm not kidding. I gotta keep moving. They're watching me like a hawk. I'll see you later. Max. Hey! - Jules. Hi! I've been trying to call you. Where have you been? - I've been busy. - I heard. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. You're-- you're back. Yeah. What am I gonna do in Boston, right? I guess for better or for worse, I belong here. So, you want to go to dinner on Tuesday? Max Matteo. Yes? Saul Rubin. Excuse me. Studio acquisitions. I've been watching dailies of "Secret Scruples." I like what I see. It looks very good. Very good. Very fine work. - Thank you. Thank you very much. We're-- we're seriously vying for that film. - Great. - Yeah. So what are you up to? What's in the works, huh? - Oh, there you are. - Oh! Hi. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it's so nice to see you lovely. Because I-- I love the feeling I'm nothing. Come on, huh? It's good to be famous. Oh. Max, this is Kate-- not that she needs an introduction. This is Max, a fine young actor who just may be in our very next hit. '66 Mustang, right? Uh, '99 Mustang, silver. Ooh. Do you two know each other? Uh, kind of. Well, I'll kind of leave you alone together then. See ya. So, you must be on TV. You haven't seen the spot? Spot? What, do you live under a rock? On the moon? I don't watch much TV. Then you're my new best friend. [inaudible] said something like, a good marriage is that in which each appoints the other guardian of his solitude. Which-- - Nice. Yeah. No room for codependents. I would think not. No. I'll have to read it. I'll lend it to you. [party music playing] [knocking] WOMAN: Hello! Sonny! Sonny, are you in there? What? The old man wants to see you. MAX: Yeah, in a minute. Who's-- It's like the scene from "The Godfather" when James Caan was in the bathroom with the bridesmaid. I haven't seen it. I'll lend it to you. [music playing] Are you ever going to tell me what you're famous for? Is that you? All right, here we go. Robert Hoskins, 42, used to roll around in Madonna's garbage. That is, until one of her bodyguards shot him. I remember that. How's it going, boys? It's good. Just looking at these celebrity stalker files you wanted. This is fascinating stuff. Bernard Artiz pledged his love to Linda Ronstadt, promised to be there for her always. Is that the way it works over there, Sanchez? Gee, I don't know, Grattola. [inaudible] came all the way for Italy to take away Sharon Stone and marry her. Has that been working for your people? That was three years ago. How do you remember that shit? Just paying attention. We got our first real lead on this case, a Mr. Max Matteo. What's his story? He's the actor who took over the role Inglewood was going to do before he was murdered. Might be a long shot, but so far he's the only one with any motive. Ooh. Listen to this. "When I would go to see his movies, I felt he was inside me. I would have multiple orgasms in multiplexes all over the city." Mm-hmm, uh-huh. Yeah. For the last decade, I've been looking at women through a cracked windshield. I look at her, I don't know why she's with me. It's called success. It's been proven to clear your skin. She's so beautiful. She's-- she's together. So what's the problem? I feel like I'm going to be found out, and then it's going to be all over. Like I'm going to be invisible again. Max, she's lucky to be with you. Can I tell you something? Of course. It's pretty heavy. [knocking] MAN: Hey, Max, they're ready for you. Oh, shit. I-- I gotta go. Call me later. I gotta go to work. - Yeah. Um-- I'm going to be all right. I'll, uh-- I'll call you when I get back from Mexico. Uh-- Enjoy yourself, Max. You worked hard to get here. Don't worry so much. Is there any shit in my teeth? No, man. You're good to go. OK. [music playing] [muttering in latin] Did you bring half of Mexico back with you? OK. That's the last of it. Are you gonna stay here tonight? I'm going to go back to my own place. I got-- I got a lot of mail. I got cats. I got-- Will you stop for a minute and talk to me? It's been talked to death. For the hundredth time, we didn't do anything. We just took some ecstasy and sat on the beach. Do you know how fucked up that sounds? I mean, in one sentence you say you didn't do anything. And then you say you did ecstasy on the beach with those-- with those slimy British producers of all people. Come on. They're not that bad. I have a career too, you know. I was just meeting some new people. And you were never around. Doing ecstasy on the beach with two guys while your boyfriend is working his ass off, it doesn't give me great visuals, OK? I was just having a little fun. And you wouldn't touch me, Max. I mean, you wouldn't touch me. I was playing a priest, Kate. Priests, they don't have sex, OK? And I told you that before we left. I didn't think you were serious. [music playing] WOMAN (ON RADIO): Unit 453, please respond to a 10-05 [inaudible]. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Thank you. The buzz is out on "Combustion." It's the last casting session. There's a great supporting part, Max. I heard about this script. Are there any names going up for my role? There's always names involved, Max. Now, you just forget about them. You go in there, give them hell. [inaudible]. I specifically said I didn't want this green leafy lettuce. I wanted the white, heart-shaped lettuce. Crispy, crunchy! Snap, crackle, pop. And I absolutely do not-- I repeat, do not want fucking croutons! I'm sorry, sir. I misunderstood you. I'll get this right away. Hey. Everything all right here, gentlemen? Yeah, yeah. I mean-- I mean, everything is A-OK. Actually, my salad was terrific. How about you, Ira? This is the best bowl of soup I've ever had. - There you go. - It's the best. The service-- the service also was-- great service. - Very good. Very good, man. That was terrific. Why haven't I met you before? I don't know. You're the first one to get this guy's void, unfulfillable as it might be. Thanks a lot. Look, I'm obligated to see other people. But are your dates free? Uh, yeah. I believe so. They are. Yes. - Yeah? Good. We'll know in a couple of days. Max. Waste of time. They're going to offer it to Michael Lange. What are you talking about? I thought that guy was, like, blacklisted. Am I talking to you? Supposedly he's off the booze, the coke, and whatever else. It's a pretty physical role. Probably rewrite the whole fuckin' script just to suit him. I heard they wanted to go with somebody new for the flashy supporting part. Where'd you pick that up, with [inaudible]?? Independent film, no money, no choice. Maybe I need to get a drug habit. Then I'd get some work. Speaking of the devil. [music playing] Waste of my fucking time, cocksuckers. Hello, Mr. Lange. I'm sorry we're running a little late today. You don't want the director to feel rushed with your meeting. Can I get you something to drink? No. No, I'm good. Thank you. I'm sorry, Mr. Lange. But you can't smoke here. I could get in trouble. We wouldn't that, now would we? We usually sneak a smoke in the stairwell by the elevator. Sounds good. [inaudible] Gentlemen. OK. James Keyan. That's me. [elevator ding] [groaning] [interposing voices] My baby! My-- Cut. Love it. I love it. It's perfect. I want you to-- want you to print this one. Max, take the baby from her. She won't give me the baby. Rip it out of her hands. Do it anyway. Rip it out of her hands. - Great job. - Thank you. Great job, Max. Oh, Max, you're on fire. [interposing voices] Thank you. You've got great hair. Come in. Come in. It's the last 10 minutes. HOST (ON TV): We're back with Michael Lange. We're talking about how terrible accidents-- tragedies, really-- can change your life for the positive. Now, you mentioned to me earlier that at first you thought you were shoved, pushed down two flights of stairs. My god. Please explain. MICHAEL (ON TV): Well, that's true. And that's still true today. I was pushed. Pushed by the hand of God. [stammering] You see, I lived in denial for so many years over my drug and alcohol abuse that when I was regaining consciousness in the hospital, the first thing that occurred to me was, this isn't my fault. I was pushed. Once again, denial. The truth is-- [stammering]---- I was so stoned I don't remember anything, really. Anyway, about 5:00 AM one morning, I'm in my hospital bed awake. I could not sleep. I was so filled with anger over having put myself in this position when this voice spoke to me inside. And it said, (SINGING) you should be dead. You're not. It's time to start doing something good with your life. Give something back. So that's when I started the Michael Richard Lange Foundation-- Let's-- let's turn this. It's depressing. No it isn't. It's beautiful. This thing is on 24/7. WOMAN (ON TV): Hundreds of people coming to lay flowers down at the spot where television star EJ Inglewood met with his tragic and untimely death. I loved EJ Inglewood. This is precisely why I don't watch TV. Max! [door closing] Just read it. Just-- just read me the breakdown. Go ahead. OK. Come on. OK. "Jan, a handsome determined young Norwegian with long blond hair, intelligent blue eyes, a quiet leader with short temper, and a sweet smile." My god, that sounds fucking terrific. Why won't they see me? Because you're Italian, Max. I mean, this guy is Norwegian. Hey, come on. Johnny Depp, he plays Donny Brasco. Jason fucking Gedrick played the last don, huh? What about-- what about Christopher Lambert in "The Last Sicilian"? Wait a minute. No, no. Do you remember that debauchery? That's different, Max. I mean, the rules don't apply. They're stars. Hey, I do a lot of different roles on stage besides Italians, Ira. Come on. Well, what about that World War II movie I was going to read for. Where's that? It was cast. Hey, I didn't even get a chance to read for that. Hey, you know what? I don't care. I could be the last person that they see. Just get me in on Jan. And it's Yan, not Jan. The guy is Norwegian. - OK. - Yeah, Jan. What? My mom used to do that. Do what? Cut her steak into these ready, bite-sized pieces for me. Didn't your mom used to do that? No. My mother was a vegetarian. Actually, my mother was a liquitarian. That manager I met yesterday might want to rep me. So I might get a little more than pre-screens for a change. Good. I've got to get [inaudible],, or I'm going to be stuck like Brooke Shields in her damn Calvins. It took her a decade to outlive that. She had a break, and she took it. You're a beautiful girl, Kate. You're going to get plenty of opportunities. Are you going to go after a new agent? Why? You can't tell me you haven't thought about it. No, no, no. I can't just walk out on Ira now that I've started working. Everyone else moves to a more prestigious agency. Kate, this guy stuck by me, OK? He lent me money. He was the only positive voice I had when I was going to pack it in. I can't just walk away now. No, I understand that. It's just that-- it's like you're only hot for a minute, and then you're not. Actors would kill to be in your situation. It's just business. No, it's not. It's not just business, you know? It's loyalty, Kate. It's loyalty. I know that that's an unused word in this town, but I'd still like to use it every once in a while. OK. Will you relax? I'm just trying to help you take advantage of your situation. Yeah, well, I guess you would know about that, wouldn't you? Oh, fuck you, Max. I don't need this. Take care. Kate, just wait. The trick is hanging on to them, sport. [gunfire] Asshole. [music playing] [doorbell] [knocking] Are you going to forgive me? What for? For raising my voice. I think it was the content, not the performance. For not recognizing when my girl was being supportive. Getting warm. For being a self-absorbed prick. Bingo. [music playing] Hey. Hm? Can I ask you something? Sure, baby. If I wasn't working, would you be into me? Working? Mm-hmm. Just be honest, if-- if I wasn't working, do you think we would have ever hooked up? Well, when Saul introduced you to me as this hot actor in one of his films, that was really all I had to go on. Hm. Hey! OK, how about this? You like my ass, right? Right? Yes, I do. Well, what if I had no ass, not this well-rounded masterpiece that it is now? Or anything else that you weren't attracted to-- physically, I mean, superficially, as they say-- would you be here now? Probably not. But in the beginning, it-- it can't really be anything except superficial. Yeah. I guess so. Mm-hmm. All right. Bye. What do you want now? Captain, we want to get into the movie business. Oh, no. Not another one. Hear us out, Captain. We think our killer is an actor killing actors. And we want to stop this? If we can get the go-ahead, we go down to the Screen Actors Guild and get a list of all the movies being made. Cast. Pardon? They cast movies. That's the term. Jesus Christ. And you guys want to go under on this? I want to go under as the producer of these castings, and-- I can go under as an actor. You know, hang out, being competition. Oh. How far under do you want to go? Deep. How deep? I could get a new name, new car, new house, new life. Yeah? Well, uh, what makes you think you can cut the mustard? You done any acting? In the third grade I played a talking tree in "The Wizard of Oz." How hard can it be. Oh! Well, that's not good enough. I got a better idea. Uh, somebody once told me, you want to make moves. [chuckling] That's very interesting. Next. Don't keep anything around you can't walk out on in 40 seconds flat. Oh, man. No! I got a girl. Thank you very much. You can go now. If you feel the, uh, cops, uh-- on the corner, you, uh-- you know what? Fuck this. Yeah. So, if you're around me and you gotta go when I gotta go, I expect to keep a life. What are you, a monk? Well, what are you, smart ass? Stick to the script, please. Next. This is terrible. Hey, Frank, where is that script thing? I got it. I got it. Hey, don't get me stuck with Pasternak, will ya? Don't worry, John. I got it. READER: Next. A smart man told me once, you want to make moves, don't keep anything around you can't walk out on in 40 seconds if you feel the cops around the corner. So, if you're on me and you gotta go when I go, how do you expect to have a life. What are you, a monk? No. I got a woman. What do you tell her? She thinks I sell swimming pools. [applause] IRA (VOICEOVER): Jan, a handsome determined young Norwegian with long blond hair, intelligent blue eyes, a quiet leader with short temper and a sweet smile. MAX (VOICEOVER): That sounds fucking terrific. Why won't they see me? IRA (VOICEOVER): Because you're Italian, Max. I mean, this guy's Norwegian. MAX (VOICEOVER): I don't care. I could be the last person that they see. Just get me in on Jan. And it's Yan, not Jan. The guy's Norwegian. [horn blasts] So I'll need a stage name. What's your middle name? - Diego. - Good. What street did you grow up on? East 91st. That's not going to work. What street do you live on now? Las Palmas, you know that. There you go. Diego Las Palmas. I kind of like it. It's got a ring to it. Who taught you that? Strippers. They gotta have stage names too. I'm learning a lot from you, John. This-- this "Badge of Fury," It's really, really bad, Ira. Yeah. Well, it's a means to an end. I mean, you got some television Q and, you know, it will help in films. Look at those guys, you know, on "Friends." Jesus. OK, that's a bad example. How about "NYPD Blue"? Look, if [inaudible] writing this, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Max. Maybe I should get a publicist. You know, I've been getting calls from other agents, Ira. Maybe they wouldn't have such a problem getting me in on these A projects. Are you kidding me? I don't need acting classes. Wanna know the experience I got from working on an ambulance in New York? [inaudible],, you want to talk about pressure? Forget about it. Four callbacks. I finally go to the network, I get there, and the first thing they do is they shove these contracts in my hand, they tell me to sign them five minutes before I'm ready to go in. I'm going to make more on this series than my parents every did in their lifetime. Hey, that-- this is a colossal shirt. That's not "The Godfather." I'm expanding my repertoire. Hey, how come you never quote anything from "The Godfather Three"? "Godfather Three," what are you talking about? They made a third? That's what I heard. Pilates is the best. Keith says my ass has never ever been firmer. Yeah. So while I'm crammed in-- [inaudible] capture human behavior. He wasn't afraid to just let the camera role. Now everything's a god damn music video. It's going to be so good to finally get out of fucking debt. Gloria, they don't write parts like that for women anymore. You know, if you're not 19 and look like you're ready to suck dick, you're nowhere in this town. Sorry I'm late. Fucking traffic. Killing me. Hey, George. Maxy, the best. MAN: I knew this was-- [interposing voices] --and they're smiling, that's a good sign, right? It's a good sign, right? You're a little late, huh? I had to run some errands. And I [inaudible]. Hey, relax. Buy me a drink. I want to make a toast. [cheering] To my cousin Max. Hey, Maxy boy. Happy birthday. Go, Max! You had a great year, and you deserve it. Your hard work and dedication has always been an inspiration to me. If you work hard, you'll get rewarded. Hope you're making good money, man, because the next round's on you. [laughing] Happy birthday. Cheers, man. [interposing voices] Hi. Can I-- can I help you? Yeah. We saw your movie last night. You were great. Oh, well-- well, thank you. Can I bother you for an autograph? Uh, sure. Oh. Doreen. Doreen, OK. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, good luck to you. Thanks. Take it easy. I love the feel of nothing. You are so sweet. Oh! Hey! [applause] I'm sorry for attracting attention to myself. I don't-- I don't really like to. But I'm an actor. It's what I do. It's what we do to survive, right? Honestly, I'd prefer not to be noticed. You know me, I'm quiet. Listen. Listen, you ever hear of a play where nothing happens? Something has to happen for you to exist. That's what I'm saying. You know, I attract attention to myself, but I just feel sorry about it sometimes. Sorry? You don't have to be sorry? No, I am. I'm sorry now. You don't have to apologize to nobody for nothing. I don't know. If I hear that line one more time, I will fucking kill someone. Once I had the baby, all that career ambition went right out the window. I'd have a baby with Max. [inaudible] [inaudible]. Drink scotch, [inaudible]. At your place? Psst. I know. MAX (VOICEOVER): I don't know. You say it doesn't matter, [inaudible].. I don't give a fuck. ACTOR: [shouting] It is very, very interesting. [shouting] This guy has such edge, totally submerges himself in the character. I found him at dinner theater in Albany. [shouting] Are you ready, Danny? Are you OK, son? I'm working on the heat. You know, it's supposed to be really hot in the script. OK, man? [shouting] This is Max Matteo. Max, I'd like to introduce you to our director, Mr. Ratner, and our producer, Mr. Delancey. Max here did some very fine work in "Combustion" and "Secret Scruples." That's right. Yeah. What are you doing? Excuse me? Like they don't see my bag? Your bag? Yeah, that's right. My bad. What do you think that means? It means I could be sitting there. It's a simple rule of life, pallie. A guy's got a bag by his seat, it's his seat, hm? George [inaudible]. Yo. You're on. Watch my shift. You had me waiting for an hour. I'm sorry, Frank. I had all these people to see. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. All right. Nah, empty calories. Gotta stay lean. I picked these up off a bulletin board on the way out. You don't need that crap. You're a natural. Hey, John, you think acting makes you crazy, or crazy people are drawn to acting? Crazy is crazy, man. I gotta get going. So soon? Yeah, I got an audition tomorrow morning. Don't forget me when you're famous. Yeah, right. See ya. Thou nature art my goddess. Wherefore should I stand in the plate of customs-- the curiosity of nations to deprive me, for that I am some 12 or 14 moonshines lag of all brother? Wherefore base? When my dimensions are as well compact-- dimensions are as well compact, my mind as generous and-- my mind as generous, and my shape as true as honest madam's issue? Why brand they us with base-- with baseness? Bastardy? Base, base? Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take more composition and fierce quality than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, go to the creating a whole tribe of fops, got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then, my legitimate Edgar-- well, then, my legitimate Edgar-- well, then, my legitimate-- it's a fine word, legitimate. Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed and my invention thrive, then Edmund the base shall too be the legitimate. I grow. I prosper. I prosper. I-- I prosper. Now, gods, stand up for bastards. What the hell is this? They're doing a movie about Abbie Hoffman. It's a great story. Quite an education I'm getting. I remember that nut. What do you say we go get a beer? No, I can't. I got another acting class in the morning. Fine. Hey, will you run lines with me later after this? Run what? My name's Tony Felice, and I'm reading for McKinnel. Jesus, he didn't recognize you? I thought he might, but he didn't. He was so hammered, I think. He reminds me of that guy from Big Mike's. Thank you. Thanks. Now the ocean's not big enough, sky's not blue enough-- [beeping] MAN (ON VIDEO): Sorry. Didn't know the ringer was on. Maybe you should finish inhaling your lunch. He's got some anger. Maybe we should stop fucking around and grab this guy. This is it. This is the one you've been talking. What's it say? Huge studio film, and they want a fresh face. You land this part, you'll write your own ticket. All I've ever wanted is the opportunity, Ira. And I will get this role. KATE (VOICEOVER): When I want something, because I love the feel of nothing. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): I was pushed. Pushed by the hand of God. [stammering] MAN: Max Matteo. Next. COYLE: How did it go? I don't know. I think I nailed it. COYLE: You think he'll take the bait? What? Oh, yeah. COYLE: What's the matter? I don't think there's enough humor in my work. COYLE: Come on, Spencer Tracy. [inaudible] your new home. Gotta find the surprise in the sea. What is it, Max? You know, I put up with your shit because behind all your moodiness and your Italian angst, I can see that there's a good man. This constant refusal to let me in-- Michael Lange. What about him? It wasn't the hand of God. I pushed Michael Lange down the stairs. What the hell are you talking about? Oh my god. Why-- would would you do something like that? So I could get the part we were up for in "Combustion." What kind of person would-- would push a man down the stairs for a part in a movie? I needed a break. I mean, I never got a break. It was always someone else. The only reason why you're here now is because I pushed him. No, don't you turn this around on me or anybody else, you coward. You understand that what you did makes you sick? Do you understand that? This is-- you've got to get some help, Max. Whatever you do in this life, get help. [door closing] Where have you been? So did I get it? No, it's between you and another actor. Who is it? They wouldn't say. Nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. I don't fucking believe this, you know? I mean, how much blood do they want? [music playing] [glass shattering] I mean, who is this fucking guy anyway? Diego? Diego Las Palmas? You've got to be kidding me. I don't know who that is. How come I don't know that name? First fucking film? Oh, well, that-- a newcomer? I'm a newcomer, Ira. Yeah-- this was supposed to be my turn, remember? Fuck! Unbelievable! I should have taken care of this before the callback. I should have. Well, yes, yes. I know, I know. No. No. No, I won't! Fuck! [beep] MAX (ON MACHINE): Kate, it's. Me I'm sorry I've been a disappointment, but I just can't be a failure any longer. I do love you, Kate. [dialing] Hey, it's Max. Leave me a message. I'll call you right-- [dog barking] [police ambiance on tv] What are you doing for dinner? [phone ringing] Yeah? The actor is hungry? Yeah, starving. Well, I'm at this prick's mercy. So until I get relieved, if Max don't go out to eat, neither do I. All right. What the hell you watching? "Young Lions." Marlon Brando plays a Nazi, yet you feel for him. It's really a remarkable performance. Well, all is quiet on this Western front. Well, hopefully not for long. [doorbell] [knocking] Max? Max? [cats meowing] [phone ringing] [beeping] IRA (ON MACHINE): Max, you there? Pick up? You're not going to believe this. You've been nominated for an American Independent Film Award. "Combustion," best supporting actor. They're making the announcements tomorrow morning. Can you believe this? [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] Ah, real smart. Send a uniform. Not a great idea. Fucking-- [beep] Hey, just take it easy. No, no. You take it easy. Who the hell are you? Where are you from? New York. How original. You do any theater? - No. Not really. Member of the Studio? Studio? The Actors Studio. No. You got a picture and resume with you? No. My agent has it. I finally catch a fucking break in this unforgiving hole of a town, and now you come along. Oh, ooh! A fresh face! You took a part away from me. I don't see why they should go with you. Well, what do you got? Huh? You know what? You got a drug habit? Can you please not point that gun at me? Back off. OK, go ahead. Do it. Let's see what you got. Do what? The audition. Do it. Let's see what you got. Here? Now? Yes, you dumb fuck. I mean, where else? I'm going to be Bill. I'll be Bill. Which scene? All of them. Any time you're ready. So you say you were home the night of the murder. That is correct. Were you with anybody? Uh, no. I was at home reading, preparing for work the next day. I had a substantial presentation, one of those career-defining things. Do you usually work at home? Sometimes. I think you are lying, Bill. Your neighbor said she saw no lights on at your place. You don't work in the dark, do you? Tell you what, I gotta go make a few calls. When I get back, you will be straight with me, or I'm going to drag your sorry ass all over this room. Son of a bitch! [dialing] [phone ringing] [line busy] [car starting] I'm sorry about that. OK. Go ahead. I said, you follow? It's not going to be pretty. I want to see my lawyer. There will be plenty of time for that. Don't you worry, William. I'm sure you'll have a whole team of lawyers. Easy scene. Where's your inner life, huh? Where's your inner life? This guy, he is exhausted, is he not? His life is shit. Where's your fucking sensory? He's got a bad marriage, huh? Where's the pain? Where-- where-- where's that pain where-- where it's difficult to just get up in the morning, let alone deal with scum like me? [tires squealing] Pasternak, I can't get through to Sanchez. - Next scene. - The one where we're shot? Yeah, that's right. I'm going to be Tyrone. I'll be Tyrone. You mind if I sit on the couch for this? Well, it would make sense if you were shot, wouldn't it? Is that what you did in the audition, you sat on the couch? Yeah. You? On the floor. Where he was supposed to be. Nice. Oh, Jesus. Oh. Aw! Aw, Jesus. OK. Any time you're ready. Oh! Oh! Oh, Jesus Christ. [groaning] Oh, Jesus. I've been shot. There's nowhere to go, Bill! It's all over! 14 Mary 10, officers down. I need assistance. I repeat, officers down. Suspect is still at large. 14 Mary 10, requesting backup at 5020 Sierra Bonita. Officer down. I need backup. I need [inaudible]. You're gonna make it. You tell my wife-- you tell my wife I'm sorry. You tell her yourself. You hang tough. The cavalry will be here any minute. You tell her. You tell her that she should have had better. I was-- Come on, Tyrone. Don't you go on me. Come on. Come on, Tyrone. Stay with me. Jesus Christ! Who the fuck is Tyrone? Cops' wives. It's no life. Don't you go on me. No! [sobbing] You want me, Bill? You motherfucker! You come and get me! Do you hear me? Come and get me! LAPD, freeze! [gunshot] [gunfire] You all right? I think so. You? Yeah. Max? Yeah. Who the fuck is Tyrone? [police sirens] So you really believed I was shot, huh? Don't you go on me. Don't you go on me! Cops' wives. It's no life. [sobbing] You want me, Bill? You come and get me! You hear me? You come and get me! You should have walked away when you had the chance! Now you're all mine! [gunfire] Cut. Fucking brilliant. Only in the movies do people come out blasting like that. Suicide. Complete suicide. It's unrealistic. Let's do it again. Good work, you guys. [music playing]
