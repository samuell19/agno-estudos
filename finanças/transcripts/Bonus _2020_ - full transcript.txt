Kelya, come out now. There's no use splashing in the water. Let's go. I will... I will definitely succeed in a month. I hope you know that VFX can change anything these days. I think I've water phobia. Fear of drowning will teach you how to swim. Remember this. Great. Thank you preacher. Let's go. It's pretty late. Yes, let's go. I advise my patients to swim but I can't manage it on my own. Listen! Stop this and clean the car windows first. - Okay sir. - It has some spots. - Krushna, lemon tea for me. - Yes sir. - The compressor has conked out. - Then replace it. I'll take it and return it tomorrow. - Alright. - Not at all. I won't sleep without AC. Tell me if you can't manage to repair. I will install a new AC by evening. - Adi. - Sir, I will do something. - Adi. - Coming. Sir, I will repair it by evening. - Sure? - Yes. Yes sir. I can't tolerate their incompetence. Good morning. Good morning. Because of your vegan diet craze, my cottage cheese dish... ...got wasted yesterday. I eat everything except animals and animal products. It's as simple as that. Adi, I am talking about cottage cheese. Is that a fruit that grows on trees? Buffalo, milk, cottage cheese. Please don't get excited. I've sent a list to Krushna. He will bring everything. Sir. He's leaving. - I want it by the evening. - Yes sir. Okay. This is the receipt of your card swiped yesterday. Yes, it was Kelya's birthday. I gifted him a watch. Worth Rs. 48,000? It's classy. Outstanding. Nowadays, you swipe cards very frequently. Adi, I'm talking to you. Why do we carry cards? Every time we swipe a card, our economy grows. Has Noble Prize already been declared? It's basic economics. Earlier it was gold standard. Now, it's fiat standard. More credit will generate, more the money. That's why banks offer loans. Actually as a business entity, we should also take the loans. But it won't fit in your principles. So let it be. What if you can't repay? Escape to London. Loan is a must for running any business... ...but you should set your own limit. Similarly, there's a limit to the bonus amount too. Every year we give an increment, right? Should we still give the bonus? That's okay too. But generally, 2 to 3% of the profit is given in bonus. Whereas we give 15%. This year, we didn't even incur much profit. Still there's no change in the bonus amount. It's approximately 20 to 22%. It's crazy. Look, increment is linked with the inflation. - Bonus is not... - No office matters are to be discussed at home. I live here too. You all can discuss everything in your meeting today. Alright. I will take your leave. You come later. It's pointless to attend this meeting. My suggestions are never taken seriously. They will support him. You believe in grapevine? Today is actually your best chance. So, come well prepared. We will go together. Can the two rival empires travel together? - Okay, give me ten minutes. - Yeah. See you. Want some bread-butter? Butter? Watch out. Hey. You will collide. Hey. Slowly. Sorry sir. Sorry. I will take it. Come. What is the bonus? It's neither dividend nor interest. It's just a freebie. I'm fundamentally against the concept of bonus. Consider the present market conditions... ...and the conditions of banks. Are most of the companies opting to layoff... ...without a reason? At present, we should focus more on maximizing... ...the productivity by spending the least. I genuinely believe that in the present situation... ...our company can't afford to overspend on bonus. I am against it. I second his opinion. I've formed this company on a different principle. Accounting debit credit. These words can't express it. You might feel like an old school thought. It's okay. Never mind. But even in unfavourable situations... ...for whatever profits that we've earned... ...the credit goes to all those employees working outside. What made you laugh? Do you have any idea about the loss we incur due to human errors? That employee can't even do a menial job of pulling a trolley. Do you think he deserves such a huge bonus? How can you call it a menial job? He comes at 9:00 AM and works for 10 hours. When necessary, he works for 14 to 16 hours. How's that related to bonus? What do you know about him? You can't live his life even for a day. This is an overrated sentence. Okay? Studied under the streetlights and all that! If he wants to change his life, he should improve his efficiency. Many people live like that. If need arises one can live. Has that need ever arisen in your life? Do you want to see me in that state? Should we vote? Raise your hand if you are in favour of bonus. Well, four are in favour of bonus and four are against it. So, it's a tie. As per the law, you've the right to cast a vote, chairman Sir. Absolutely. One person can vote twice and we call it a democratic process. Okay then. We will take a month. We will discuss and explain our points to each other... ...and meet again in a month's time. Let's be as fair as possible. What say, Aditya? Drive slowly. What's this? You deliberately said that, right? What? That the boy pulling the stock is better than me. Did I say that? Really? It's your misunderstanding. No, it is not. Why can't you stand by one person firmly? You always escape confrontation. You didn't say it directly. But this is what you meant. I was talking professionally. You shouldn't have given a personal comment... ...in a business meeting and in the presence of so many people. If it has really hurt you, then there must be some fact. What fact? That he's better than me? He deserves everything that he is getting. But I do not. Nonsense. Listen. The question is not about who is better. You both are excellent at your respective places. The question is: Can you live or manage your life like he does? Why not? Try it. You've no idea. You won't be able to manage even for a day. Not just a day. I can live for a month. Then try it. Why should I? As if you will vote in my favour in the next meeting... ...if I prove myself. Okay, I'll vote in your favour. - You will? - Yes. But if you cannot manage to live... ...will you cast your vote in my favour? Done. Come on! What's this? Done? Now you're talking. Okay. How much cash do you have in your pocket? Don't know. May be Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000. So, it's more than 60% of Indian's monthly income. Okay. Live with Rs. 5000 and manage the rest. But you won't use credit cards nor will you reveal your identity. Stay anywhere. Do anything. Take up a job. Done deal. Leave tomorrow morning. One more thing. It's nothing personal. Strictly a business deal. Let's go. Adi, stop being adamant. I have a plan. You go and stay with your uncle for a few days. I will inform him. No one will know. Mom, grandpa hasn't forced me into this. I've challenged him. And not just grandpa, but I want to prove this to myself. How can I live with uncle? In that case, I was better here. - But listen to me... - Mom, I've decided. I'm going. Tell me. Is this how a company related decision is taken? What's wrong? Let's talk to Aditya. He isn't a spoilt brat. That's it! Don't you expect anything beyond that? Think of his mother. She's taken aback. He was alone in America for a year. You weren't worried. He went on a Europe tour alone. You weren't worried. Mumbai is just 4 hours away. Don't be overdramatic. As if he's going on an exile like Lord Ram. Are we done talking? Winter is coming. Both I and Serise Lanister are waiting. Kelya. Listen. Yes, where are you? I am going to Mumbai. - For a month. - Why? When did you decide? It was decided in haste. I will share the details later. Okay listen. I need your help. I need accommodation in Mumbai. For a month. Does your father know any agent? There's no need of an agent. I've a flat in Mumbai. No, I will live in a rented house. My budget is Rs. 5000. Rs. 5000?! Will you please tell me in detail? Don't irritate me now. Do as I say. I will tell you everything later. Tell me if you can help. Okay, I will send you the numbers. Okay thanks. Are you ready to take a splash in the water? You just come back. You will watch me swimming in a month. Okay, send me the number. What do you want boys? - How many? - Give me two. I want orange. I want green. - Okay. Hi. - Hi. - Myself, Bablu. - Aditya. Hail Ganpati Bappa! I hope you spoke with Sir. My Sir called up. He sends me customers with a budget below Rs. 15,000. He said your budget is very low. But don't worry. Mumbai incorporates everyone. It's just that you should be mentally prepared... ...to live anywhere in any condition. You're prepared, aren't you? Then it's okay. Your job will be done. - Yes, I am prepared. - Good. But I've some basic requirements. Please go ahead. I mean, I want commode in toilet. If there's no AC, cooler will do. Or it should at least be properly ventilated. That will be done. And it'll be good if the flat is on a height. So that you get a good view. - Most importantly, water. - Yes. It is a must. My friend said that water shortage is a big problem here. 24 hours water supply is a must. Tap should run water every time I turn it open. - You will get it. - Okay. Just see the place once. Come. Come with me. - Have we reached? - Yes sir. That's right. Let's see what happens next. We will know. Uncle, the marbles look great. Now, our Sai Baba will be living in the Taj Mahal. Good. Hello. - Yes, let's go. - Where? Meet Vikram uncle. He has spent from his pocket on the marble. - I can't hear you. - Okay. - He seems to be a new tenant. - Yes. I will show him the room. Let's see. Come, come sir. This way. Cleanliness mission is on. Come here sir. Come. Be careful. You said we've reached. You said we've reached. How far it is? Yes, we're almost there. Come. The room is too good. There's no comparison. Come. Come. Hello aunty. - What's the price? - Rs. 300. - Is it fresh? Let me see. - Yes. Take it for Rs. 250. It's very costly. Give it to me for Rs. 150. - Okay, take it. - Bablu. - I will take it on my return. - Bablu. - Yes. - Okay, I am keeping it aside. Yes, please go ahead sir. - I will take it on my return. - Okay. Come, sir. Aunty, how are you? Come, sir. Slowly. Be careful. Yes. Only this area is a little messy due to the fish market. Rest of the area is clean. The area is really good. And very quiet. This took more than my travel time from Nashik to Bombay. Oh! Hello! What's this? People are walking on the road. Can't you check before throwing water? Sorry. What sorry? Why do they do plantation in such a small place? Hey! I said sorry. It was just water. Don't react as if it was acid. - Go now. - Hey! And remove that mask. To whom are you giving this attitude? Come out. Don't you have any civic sense? Who's she? Hey 'tangled hair'! Are you scared? Boss, he's my prey. What do you mean? Listen. Don't mess with the shark. You will be chewed up. Try that. The bone will be stuck in your throat. And who's he? Did you hire a hooligan on rent? No sir. He isn't a tenant as yet. I was just showing him the room. Hey, take him inside. Otherwise we'd have killed him by mistake. Come sir. Come inside. Don't worry. Stop children. Stop. Come, sir. - Take it up. - Yes. Wow aunty! Are you cooking fish today? Hey, were you a tom cat in the past life? You're here smelling the fish. Actually, I've got a tenant for the room upstairs. Let me show it to him. - Okay. - Taking the keys. Come, sir. Come. Keep your bag here. - No, it's okay. - Keep it. I am here. Nothing will happen. - Keep it. - Please. They are familiar. Come. Call center, get aside. Come, sir. Slowly. Come, sir. Come. What's this? Only this much? This is the biggest room in the entire area. Especially for you. It's quite big for your budget. 80 sq. feet is quite a lot in Mumbai. Should we run the fan by our hands? No, you've this table fan. It works. See this. Open this door and you'll get the sea-view. Isn't it? In the evening, you get good aroma of dried fishes... ...when it's windy. I don't eat non-veg food. We don't consider fish as a non-veg food. Call it a sea fruit. You'll feel like it is a vegetarian food. Are you Jain? No, I am vegan. It's okay. Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jain, Vegan... All are accepted. No problem. Do you like it? If yes, finalize it now. We will pay Rs. 5000 to the old lady. What are you looking for? Washroom? There it is. The outlet is also provided. Yes, you can take a bath there. A tap is also provided. You get water for an hour in the morning. Store it in the drum and you can access water 24 hours. Toilet is outside. - Outside? - Yes. It's nearby. If you don't suffer from loose motion, you will need it once. Or else twice a day. In earlier times, the toilets were always outside... ...away from home. And what about these scrap? It's kept in the corner. Just ignore it. So tell me. Do you want to finalize it? No, let's check a few more options. No, let's go... - I don't mind if you want to see more options. But sir, it should fit in your budget. Sir. We will see another room. Sir. Listen to me, sir. There are many places in Mumbai. But your budget is very low. There are rooms rented for Rs. 25,000. Five people can share for Rs. 5000 each. You please drive carefully. There, you see a tower. There, we've reached. It will start. It was serviced just a day before yesterday. - It will start. - Let me try. Leave it. Leave it. It started. Give me your helmet. Sir, it was serviced day before yesterday. - Give it. - Please unfasten it. - Get back. - I will hold your bag. Where's the next room? There at the square. Guide me.

Actually, he committed a murder. And was imprisoned for 12 years. I somehow managed to run the house... ...by taking up domestic work. Why did she mention this?

You will have to manage breakfast on your own. Lock the deal only if you agree. Alright. 5... Rs. 5000, right? Yes. Rs. 5000. See you aunty. Fish was just too good. Take your commission of Rs.500.

You've taken so much unnecessarily. Take only the important things. Everything is important. What's this? Soya milk. Is this important? Place your order with Bhanu dairy.

It's so windy out here. So nothing remains a secret you see. What good? I can see the company is incurring loss. Should I still sit idle? Okay, tell me what's your present economic condition? Somewhat similar to Somalia country's economy. No money, zero income, no produces and no one will give any loan. I've Rs.70 to spend per day. But in our country, the threshold of poverty line is... ...Rs.35 per day. Compared to that, you're quite rich. How can you think of cracking a joke? Look, I can't afford to lose. It's too bloody important to me. But, how will you win? Do you realize that you can't manage in... ...whatever little you have? You need to earn money first. I know that already. But suggest me how. How would I know? Take up a shopkeeper's job. Take weekly salary. If required, take domestic work. You've invited all this. You're needlessly taking up stupid challenges... Look, my senses are not working already. Everything is going wrong with me here. There's no AC. Fan is not working. It's humid. The salty sea wind that comes from the window makes the skin greasy. I am losing my mind here. Moreover, you're suggesting me such menial jobs. Listen. Do this. You can't tolerate all this, right? Then come back. Huh! Where are you going? Come, I will drop you at the station. Come. Come quickly. Are you going to the station? - Yes, but... - Come, I will drop you. - Exams? - Yes. MBA? No, CA final. - Oh. - I must clear it this year.

Yes, I want veg food. But even in vegetarian food, I want vegan. I mean, I don't want any dairy products or animal products. Do you mean to say colostrums? - No. - Look, you won't get colostrums.

No, you're not. He's complaining of pain. Sir I... okay. You tell me how should I put it on... ...I will do that. So, you want me to teach you. Is this how you talk to the customer? You can see that I am doing it very softly. But he's complaining of pain. I don't know why your son is in pain. - What is troubling you son? - Because you're not putting it on properly. That's why I asked you to show me. I will do it accordingly. What type of staff is hired here? Is this how you talk to your customer? Let's just go to another shop. There are many shops in the area. We will buy from somewhere else. Let's go. - Okay, go. - What? How are you talking? How am I talking? Look at his attitude. Be in your limit. Worthless fellow. - What are you saying? - Aditya. What do you mean by my worth? Why do you comment on my worth? Aditya... - Your son is creating a problem here. - Cool down. - Can't you see? - Cool down. I will handle it. - Can't you understand? - Sir, I've no issues. - Aditya, cool down I say. Go to the store room. Go to the store room. Go. Go. Teach something to your hero. Sir, I am sorry. I apologize on his behalf. Is this the way to behave with your customer? - He's just a child. - I am sorry. Please sit down. Cool down. Cool down! Cool down! - Murugan - Yes. I will just come. Worth! What's your worth? What's your worth? What's your worth? What's your worth? What's your worth? What's your worth? Hip hop... Upon learning, I understood this world. Okay fine. Got it? - How will this help? - Come on, set it up quickly. Brother. Do you mind playing carrom? Yes, I do play carrom. Then come. Come. Come. Now you see. - Aditya! - Yes. Does he play? Don't know. Let me get up. Are you not playing? No, my bad luck is too bad today. You please sit. How come you are here today? Nothing. I wasn't sleepy and I saw lights here. So I came. Not getting the rhythm. - Not good? - Not getting the rhythm. You're not good at it today. Wait, something will come to my mind. Wait. Wait a minute. What's this? Bet now. Try your luck. Right? He has. - Ready? - Yes. You break. Don't cry. Just break it. Do not spare anyone if he messes with you. Uncle, come let's play a game. A partner is needed. No, I've to go to work tomorrow morning. Do this. Go home. Let me try one last time. Very nice. Style you see! - Wow! The second one. - Too good. Third one? Forget your 100 bucks. Yes, you have lost it for sure. Missed it. You asked me to forget Rs. 100? Now you just watch. Okay. Now my friend is going to play it very nicely. Listen to this. Go. Get lost. Who are you to teach me? Do you think you're smart and I am a nerd? Keep your smartness with you. Mind your own business, don't advise me. It's time to fight now. Do you underestimate me? I will show you my power. Just give me a mike. You may be a king at home, but over here, I'm the king. Speak a little, hit a light, flight a little, break a little. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. No one can learn the alphabets in just one day. Here, we've to struggle every day for our basic needs. Slowly, you get settled, you start liking then enjoying. And then you focus. You can't tolerate this crap, I know. Mind your own business. Do not mess with me. As I've lost my patience. What if I lose my mind? I will confront you on the battleground. The Henna will leave the beautiful colour. People will be stunned. Have patience. Even the venue is ready. Hot and beautiful. Waiting for the final consent. Don't be shy. Don't have any doubt. See all this, enjoy it. Have fun with people. Show them, make them famous. Prove to them. Make them dance. Play. Play the song loudly. Which one? Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. Boss never pays me on time. I am helpless. He's getting on my nerves. What do I do? Exam is near, I haven't studied. How would I appear in the exams? My girlfriend's attitude is taking heavy toll. Should I dump her? Should I break up? The other girl is hotter than her. But she's difficult to be wooed. I've lost my senses. I'm tired of this mess. Now call me. Leave it. Let me sing loudly. So, give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Give me a mike. Let the public know. Give me a mike. Let me say what I want to. Listen to the right thing. Or else just leave. There's a lot of difference in wearing shoes... ...and putting it on other's feet. But why a shoe store? Didn't you get a better job? That shop is air-conditioned. - Oh! - I am in AC for 10 hours. Good. And frankly speaking, I am staying in a place... ...where even a fan is luxury. Moreover, it's quite close to the house. - Good. - So, no need to commute by the crowded train. Besides, I get weekly salary. Life is set. How's your swimming practice going on? Good. Very good. I can float using the floater. But now, I will remove that too. And I will definitely dive in front of you. - It's decided. - Oh no. I had sent you a message. Oh no Kelya! If there's hell on this planet, then this is it. Why? This is that place. Thank God I said just one month. What happened now? I'd have gone mad had I challenged for a year. But why? Everything was set until now. Nothing. This locality is on the seashore. But water never flows from the tap. I will talk to you later. But Aditya! These notes will not dry like this. Get them ironed. You're too much. Go? This tap is very old. Let me tighten it. And yes. During the night, you better turn the main tap off. Okay. In Yerwada jail, I've repaired many taps worse than this. Did you actually commit a murder? You don't look like that type. Don't go on my looks. Once, people used to shiver with my presence. Earlier I was with the political party. One day, the opposite party members attacked. They were four. And I was all alone. Then what? I took a knife and stabbed him. Blood was flowing out like water. I took him to the hospital. Unfortunately, he didn't survive. Had I not killed him, he'd have killed me. It was a murder in attempt of defense. But a life was lost. So the culprit has to be punished. But it could be less as the murder was committed in defense. I was under trial. My party didn't even appoint a lawyer for me. I spent 12 years counting each day. I spent 12 years in prison. By the time I was released, the world had advanced a lot. But I was left behind. Many had changed in the opposite party. Their party workers joined our party and became the leader. And our party members joined them to become the minister. I'm telling you. Had that man survived, I'd be a minister today. I'd have taken control of the water department. But here I am. Became a plumber. Repairing the taps. See this. I've fixed it. Now, there won't be any issues. What else is left now? - Uncle. - Yes. Till I take my clothes to the laundryman for ironing... ...can I get something from you to wear? Yes. Sure. Iron these clothes for me. Okay. Give this one first. I will take the rest of them later. And yes, listen. Can you please iron these two notes? - Please be careful. - Yes. Don't charge me for ironing this. You're in the 10th class. Limit your use of mobile. Or else I will hit you. - Is that clear? - Yes. Also, take care of your studies. Let's go. - Is it done? - No, I am doing it. Please do it quickly. You look very smart uncle Mhatre. Hey! Did you take my picture, Minal? Wow! Hey, did you take my picture? - I will send it to you later. - Minal. Hey! Please delete that photo. Please delete. This is not done. I told you to hurry up. You're putting me in trouble. Iron one pair quickly. I am doing it, sir. Look at my condition. You please iron one pair first. Sorry, my house was flooded. Suddenly the tap broke and... Are you always after these shoes? No, actually. Do you know that this one shoe is my two months' salary? And the pair is worth my four months' salary. I wonder how much the buyers of these shoes must be earning! What would their salary be? Why do you think so much? Just don't think. Nice shoes. Okay now pack this up. Change and come quickly. Sir is already angry. Come quickly. - Yes. What do I do with this now? You know I don't like to waste food. No, I haven't had homemade food since quite a long time... ...that's why I ordered pizza. You and pizza? It's vegan. It won't get wasted. Come. Sit. Open the lunch box. We will eat. You eat. I will also eat some. Mom cooked prawns at home. And you want me to eat these grass and leaves! You better eat your vegan pizza. And do inform me the next time. Sorry. Oh my god! What's this? Listen. Oh my God! Listen to me. Our tenant has fallen down. Come quickly. - What? - See, he's injured. God! - Aditya. Look here. God! What happened to you? Aditya. Raja, come quickly. - What? - Hey, what happened? The tenant is sick. But he has good 'physics'. He doesn't even eat sea food. So naturally, his immunity would be weak. Yes, he didn't even drink in the wedding ceremony. Forget that. He doesn't even drink milk. That's why. Send him to me for 2 hours. If he will sit with me, he will become fit. Very nice. What are you doing? Keep that down. Only doctor is supposed to use it. I am Dr. Tandel. Get up. What's the trouble? Take a deep breath. Okay. Cough a bit. Open your mouth. Take your tongue out. It's nothing serious. You will feel better in two days. But, what's wrong with me? It's nothing. You're in safe hands. Trust me. You will feel good in 2 days. See this. These red and green tablets... ...are to be taken after breakfast. These blue and orange tablets are to be taken after dinner. And if you feel nauseated, vomiting or headache... ...then take this yellow tablet. Okay? What about the blood test? Won't you recommend blood test? Not required. We will think about it later if it gets worse. What do you mean? Trust me. Don't worry. Look, there's still time for the clinic to open. Until then, you can take rest. And if needed, a well-equipped oxygen cylinder is here. Saline is also there. So don't worry. Now sleep. Just relax. Sleep. Come on. There comes the doctor. Fatso, why do you block the way? How's he? Don't worry. I have treated him. He will be fine in 2 days. Let's go then. - Kelya. - Yes, tell me. I hope I will get some benefits with your degree today. I wasn't feeling good yesterday. I started feeling cold suddenly and was shivering. And then fell unconscious. Even now, I feel heavy headed. I'm in a strange clinic. The doctor gave me colourful tablets. Listen. I am scared. I hope it is not swine flu. First of all, I am a physiotherapy doctor. I'm nowhere connected with those tablets. If you doubt, you can get the test done. Swine flu test will cost you around Rs. 6000. Rs. 6000? It's very expensive. You find it expensive? This is a historical moment. Listen. There are some basic tests... ...that can be done for Rs.700 or 800. I will send you the details. Get those done. Thanks. Fatso, get aside. Why's she here now? Wait. I will see you. Okay I will talk to you later. Bye. No need to visit me. I am not that serious. Who are you? And why did you come here? - Huh? - Huh? Are you not getting it or trying to avoid? This is a clinic and I am unwell. Will you tell me why you've come here? To work. At least you should have deleted your facebook profile before coming. Alright. You don't want to tell me? Bye. No, stop. I will tell you. But please. Shall we go home and talk? I feel uneasy over here. Let's go home. Let's go. Challenge. So, you will go after a month. Is this a game for you? This isn't a grocery account. I'm an economics grad. What's my motive and why I am here? I need not tell you that. You're doing CA. Don't be sentimental. And it's a fact. Your world and my world are completely different. I can never be a part of your world. Accept it. Are you an alien? Have you come by the flying soccer? - Come on Minal! Where... - Hey... The point is that there's nothing like your world and my world. There's only one world. And all of us are a part of that one world. By the way, just staying here for 30 days will not make you a winner. Look, I am not in a mood to argue with you. Sending you some concoction. Take it. And take those tablets. If you die, people of your world will say that you died in our world. No, I will decide after the blood test. Go to hell. Hey, I know your area is quite windy. But better keep this a secret. Strange. What's this, sir? You bought it for Rs. 1200 yesterday. And today, you're selling it for Rs. 900. You made a loss making the deal. Mind your business. Don't teach me. I never make a loss doing deals. If you're done packing, just leave. Yes, it's done sir. Sir, two-three people have come for the pickup. It's good if you give something happily. But I am not happy. So why should I give anything? Now go. Don't get on my nerves. Don't get angry, sir. I didn't force you. He didn't even offer water. Come on, take this up. Let's go. Make it quick. Don't take so much time. Pick up. Rs. 700. Sir, these are your reports. It's normal. There's nothing. You charged so much to tell there is nothing? Instead, I'd be happy if I was suffering from a disease. I hope I will remain alive tomorrow. Aditya. Yes sir. If you take a leave next time, I will deduct your salary. Sorry sir. Actually I was unwell. I was shivering with fever. It's okay. Take this key. You will shut the shop tonight. - I am going early. - Okay. And yes. Tomorrow morning, you will have to come early. Open the shop early. It's the last day of the sale. - So there will be rush. Okay? - Yes sir. Hey... Is anyone dead? I asked because the crackers are bursting. Three students have passed the 10th grade in the first go. Wow! Did they get a rank? No 41%. 47% and 54%. So, what's there to celebrate? What do you mean? Leave it. You won't understand. - Did you eat? - No. Or you want me to send your lunch box home? Will you come home for dinner? You decide. Only if you want to come to 'our world'. Otherwise, I will send you the lunch box. Do I look like a filmy villain? Not exactly. But somewhat similar. Cruel. Coming. I will get fresh and come. - Okay. No fever. Colourful tablets have done wonders. I am sure the rainbow is formed in my body. Do you have a girlfriend? It's not easy to tolerate you. Not any. What about you? Do you have any? I had one. Same as you. Cruel. So? Nothing. Same old cliché. Ours is different. Yours is different. Our world and your world. You know. I wonder how people live and manage in little income. And still they are very happy. How's money linked with happiness? Obviously it is. I earn Rs.4000 by putting on shoes in people's feet. Then I feel like living a better life. So I buy an air cooler. Second day, I fall ill. If you want to live here, you should not fall sick. If you had some trust, you'd have got treated in just Rs.200. But you had not. How can I trust? How were the tablets? Colourful. This is how we get treated. Either by the tablets or by the trust. Amazing. By the way, who paid Rs. 200 to the doctor? He may not have charged.. ...or maybe boys have shared it. This is how we live. And you also paid for Bhendya uncle's funeral that day. So, call it a community kitty. My pocket money was Rs. 12000 in college. And now, it's Rs. 4000. That's a very little amount. My stipend is Rs. 3000. This isn't something to feel proud about. I am sorry. Look. You're not actually getting my point. Wait a minute. The point is that contentment is natural. Wealth luxury is artificial poverty. What luxury? At present, if I get a little extra curry, it will be a luxury for me. Right away. Will you try prawns? - Wow. Nice watch! - Yes. - Waterproof, right? - Yes. By the way, only five days are left. Aditya will win the bet. It's not over till it's over. Aditya will win when he returns, right? Yes. - Five days are left. There's still a lot of time. You remove that support now. I will teach you how to swim. You?! But will I be able to manage? Yes, of course. Remove it. Come on. - Are you sure I will manage? - No doubt. You can't learn with those floats like children. Come. Very good. Come here. Come. Come. Swim. Move your legs. - Hold me properly. - Move your legs. Keep moving. Come on. Keep moving. Bring your waist up. - Waist up. - Hold me properly. Yes, very good. Very good. Now leave my hand. - What are you doing? - Go there. Go there. Yes. Move your legs. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. What are you doing? I will die like this. See, you swam from there. - Now, let's go back. - No way. No. I'll be better off without you. - Sure? - Yes. - Will you go there again? - No. - Wow! - Yes sir. His flexibility is good. Slowly, it will shape according to your leg. Let's go there. Look at this. You want to buy t-shirts, right? You take a look. I am going. Let's go there. - Try it. - Uncle. - Excuse me. Just a minute. - Murugan. - Yes. - Take care of this customer. - Yes. - Check another one in light shade. - I will attend there. - Try both of them. - Okay. Yes ma'am. - This t-shirt. - Do you have more colours in this? This is a limited edition. 50% discount. Excuse me. Don't take it. Murugan, Amit is not around. Why is he late today? - Call him up. - Sir, I tried several times. But he didn't receive my call even once. - Call him again. - Okay. How many times should I call him up? No? - No thanks. - How does it look? Excuse me. Is anyone there? Yes! Coming sir. You couldn't take up the responsibility even for a day. He used to try these shoes in front of you every day. Why didn't you tell me once? Is this how you people work? Useless. Sir, I agree I should have told you. He used to try shoes at times. But I never imagined he would go to this extent. Sorry, it is my mistake. What sorry? It was worth Rs. 15,000. Are you worth it? Your salary is just Rs. 4000. Do you know my worth? Do you know? I can see. Through you, your family's worth can be judged. They must have deserted you. My family's worth can be through from me? - Look. - Look sir. Wait a minute. You saw Amit Kumar wearing the shoes in CCTV footage. You know he has stolen the shoes. I agree I made a mistake. And I apologize. You need not involve my family in this. Will your family pay Rs. 15,000? Have I stolen the shoes? Have I stolen the shoes? Everyone coming to the shop is judging my worth. What's your worth? Will you show me my worth? Will you raise your voice at me? Then what do you expect me to do? - I will see you. - Don't touch me. I'll buy both you and your shop. Take him in the custody. But I am innocent. Come. Sir, why don't you check the CCTV footage? - Will you teach me? - Come on. Come on. Is the owner lying? You raised hand at him and argued with him. Take him in the jeep. Constable. Ask him once. Want to settle the matter here or want to go behind bars? But I haven't done anything wrong. Give whatever you have. Otherwise you will have to spend a night in custody. Got it? Rane, did you speak with Shinde's PA? - Yes sir. - Sure? Yes. I've only Rs. 200. It's okay. Go. And don't get into such matters again. Understand? Go. - I will give you next month. - Okay. Rs. 5000. Rs. 5000? Is this Amit Kumar's house? He has left. Where? He left in the morning with his luggage. Thank you. No politics in the area. Don't cross this line. Let's see who will stop us. Hey. Brother. Now it's time. Show them. See this. They've hired a wrestler on rent. Hey! What's this? Boss, get up. Get up Boss. - What's this? Get up. - Boss. Hey! We will deal with you later. We won't spare you. Take him away first. I will deal with them later. Let's go. Didn't I say? I was confident about his 'physics' (physique). Yes. Aditya, eat something. Should I serve you now? No, I don't want to. It will get cold. Eat when it's warm... I said I don't want to. You can't vent your anger on food. I am going. I don't want to win over anyone. Wonder why, but I am missing my mom today. I've decided. I will transfer your mom's money once I reach Nashik. Are you crazy? If not yet, then I will go crazy for sure. I will definitely get mad if I stay here further. What is my mastery, Minal? Nothing. I can't even repair a normal tap in the house. I depend on Mhatre uncle for that. For repairing the footwear, go to the cobbler. At least Santya earns by selling pots. But look at me. I am good for nothing. I am good for nothing. I kept aside my self-respect and chose to work... ...in a shoe shop putting shoes in people's feet... ...but I got fired from there without being at fault. I felt like finding the real culprit and giving him a tight punch. But when I went to his house, I felt... ...maybe it's not his mistake. You know what? In Nashik, police would rush to me on a single phone call. Just on a phone call. Today, they were hitting me. Slapped me. It's very insulting, Minal. I never felt so helpless in life. Hapless. No. No. Grandpa established that company. And he was right. I am not worth it. Let him do as he wishes. I am going back. Aditya, you were anyway going to return. You didn't come to stay here permanently. Now if you return defeated, your grandpa will not like that. But yes. If you return as a winner, he will definitely be delighted. And I am ready to bet on this. You're still not getting it. Aditya, you're not getting it. Will you give up for such a petty matter? People 'earn and eat' over here. The day they earn, they eat. The day they do not, they sleep empty stomach. But they never give up. They wake up in the morning with a big smile. ...and get back to work. You're too good Minal. You can cajole anyone. You live in this locality, work and study. You're doing CA. You're earning for yourself. I really... I really respect you. Aditya, I strongly believe in free will. But now, my only expectation and wish is that... ...you don't go. I'd be happy to see you passing by... ...my balcony tomorrow morning. Did you get it? Please eat now. Minal, can you please leave me alone for a while? Okay. Take it. What's this? Hey Aditya. Where are you off to in the early morning? To the bus depot. Want to go home urgently. I will drop you. This is our truck. No, I will go. No way! I will drop you. Hey Kharat. Take this. And you also stand behind. Let's go. Come. I will drop you. Come on. Let's go. Yes. Give me your bag. Okay. - Come. - I'd have gone on my own. Let me serve you one day. Let's go. Drop him at the bus depot. Then go ahead. Aditya, give me that piece of cloth. Do you want a sanitizer? How many times do you rub this? Don't you get proper set of boots and gloves? Why do you discuss all this? We get one pair among five people. Let me tell you. After working for 24 hours, now the odour is fixed in mind. You know the flower? They blossom, wither and turn into garbage. And then it starts to stink. I can never get the smell of fresh flower. Only after taking two sips, I start getting all the smell. Now I am addicted. Hey, do you play lottery? I could never win even in a housie game. Forget about winning lottery. But I play. I buy a lottery ticket every Monday. Pray to the God. If I don't win on Saturday, I buy it again on Monday. You see, living becomes easy with hope. This Saturday, you will win. Because I've touched it. I will chop off your hands and keep them in my home. Should I give you a tight punch? Why didn't you open the door? I knocked it several times. Don't you have any sense? Can't you leave a message? Had you not been here... ...I'd have gone looking for you everywhere. When I saw you, I saw myself in a new form. Slowly, I've fasten this bond between the hearts. We will meet again, lose again and search those marks again. A new gesture. That I wish to get again. Your gesture that snatches away my heart. Unrealized, but on the same path... I feel a strange craze. Our hearts are restless. I enjoy this restlessness. Let's talk to each other. Listen to each other. And feel these moments once again. A new gesture. That I wish to get again. Your gesture that snatches away my heart. A new gesture. That I wish to get again. Your gesture that snatches away my heart. This downpour that followed the storm. Shares love drop by drop. Take me in your embrace, hold my hand. Let the eyes express. We will colour again, shape again. And embrace the shadows. A new gesture. That I wish to get again. Your gesture that snatches away my heart. A new gesture. That I wish to get again. Your gesture that snatches away my heart. Hi. Hi. I am sorry. I hope I am not disturbing you. No, not at all. Please join me. - Are you sure? - Yes, please. I've seen you here many a times. But we never met. - Aditya. - Vikram. - Do you stay here? - Over there. Oh I see. But my home is here. That's my house. I don't live there now. Still, that's my home. At present, I am living in my son's house that I built for him. And this is my home that my dad built for me. That's why I come here. I heard that you're returning. Yes, I came here only for a month. Okay. So, how was the experience? Enjoyed. What did I achieve and what did I lose. I've no account. You can never calculate. Credit and debit never tally here. Drink? No, I don't drink. Okay. Have fish. I'm vegan. Oh! Rules. You're stuck in your own rules. You must break it. Break. Cheers for that. There are a lot of memories in this locality. - And they are planning to redevelop. - Really? Oh I see. - Hi. - Hi. There's a dance going on in the pre-wedding ceremony. And both of you are chatting here. Go. I will see you later. What did he say Advised me. He said try and break your own rule at times. So, what did you decide? Wow! Not bad! How do you feel? Slimy but satisfying. Which type of fish is this? It's called Bombay duck. Do you want prawns? Should I bring some? Hey! Where's the call centre girl? She eloped with her boyfriend. Let me do the bowling. It's your batting now. Come, sir. This is the biggest room in the locality. Especially for you. Come. Wait batsman. Are you leaving, sir? Okay. Give the key. Ask him if you want to. He stayed here for a month. Please come. Come. The room is really lucky. Come. Throw properly. Come. Be careful. It's sea-facing. Come on! Throw now. This time, he will be out. Hey stop. Even if you didn't tell, we came to know. I use the pipes manufactured by your company. How can I accept rent from you? That's why I didn't tell you. If I told you earlier, you'd have treated me like this... ...for the entire month. Uncle, I was just your tenant. And this is the rent. Keep it. No, please take it. Do come back again. To stay without paying rent. Sure, I will. Okay bye. For what? Money? So, brother? Are you leaving? Yes. Leaving without letting us know? You never greeted us with a "Hi" when you came. And now you were going without saying a Goodbye. No, it's not like that. Had you told us the truth, we wouldn't have... ...involved you in our brawl. At least my physics (physique) came to use under that pretext. Okay bye. Will you come back? Am I an alien? We live in the same world, don't we? Am I right? I will come back. Should I leave now? Okay, uncle Francis. Hey, Aditya. See this. I won this lottery for the first time. Rs. 10 000! Really? Hey! Do visit us regularly. Otherwise I will actually chop off your hands and take them away. Reduce your liquor intake. Okay. Bye. This car? Who's he? I think he's his grandfather. Congrats. You're here all of a sudden? Without any intimation? You've won. You were well aware. In any case, you won't lose. You see, this is your age to win. But to experience the joy of losing... ...there's still time. You will have to become a grandpa. What's the time? It's cheap but it shows the correct time. 2:00 PM. We should leave now. Sit in the front. I will drive. - Sir, you take the backseat. - Yes sir. Should we take her along? Very soon. By the way, how did you know that I am here? Do you think Kelya is only your friend? Let's go. Let's go. What's it? Just a minute. A friend's message. I am sorry brother. I know what you must have been through. Murugan sir told me everything. But I had the chance only that day. Either here or there. So, I eloped with Jamuna and came to the village. And married her. Shoes are very important in our wedding ceremonies. You must have heard. Take the money and return the shoes. How could I have gone wearing torn shoes? My sisters-in-law would have laughed at me. The shoes were worth Rs. 15,000. I've spoken to sir. I've promised him to return the money part by part. I apologize once again. Please go back to work. I was going to send you a message. But I thought... ...though we've water shortage in the village, 4G network is full. So, please forgive me if you can. Amit Kumar, I forgive you. You didn't invite me to your wedding... ...but I must gift you something. I will pay for your shoes. You're working for him since many years. So, consider this a bonus of this year. And congratulations! Let's go. - Shall we? - Yeah. Let's go.
