Um... Cheryl? Almost done. Just checking the connection. You have people for that. Ah, there you go. You know I can't help it. I'm hands-on. Oh! Deputy Director! Merry Christmas, Senator! Merry Christmas. And this must be - your granddaughter, Josie! - Yes, it is. Josie adores science. Ah! You remind me of me. You're an astronomer? Well, I used to be. How did you end up here? Well, I'll tell you. You see, I bumped into Cheryl while I was visiting family in Wellsboro a few years back. And I read her very impressive resume, and... And here I am... And here I go, I'm afraid. Director Phillips, maybe you would like to show the Senator and Josie the visitor's center? And I'll sneak off and finish my work, - All right. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas! Yes, and I've never seen him before. Cheryl, where are you going? I haven't finished reviewing the grant proposals and I need to finish it by the end of the year. But you'll miss the party! Story of my life. I'll meet you upstairs. At least let me help with the grant proposals. You've already gone above and beyond, Janice. I can handle the rest. I just wish I didn't have to reject so many. I can only play Santa once for every 99 times playing Scrooge! Sounds like Christmas couldn't come soon enough. You still heading to your parents' tonight? If I can make my bus in an hour. Why not drive? Wellsboro's not far. But if I drive, I can't review next year's budget, return Senator Mihara's emails...I see your point. How about that... My comet. You have a comet? Almost. In grad school, I was trying to prove a comet exists behind Pluto's orbit. Looks like a team in Norway just confirmed it. Sorry. But this might lift your spirits. What's this? A Christmas present. For someone who's always short on time. Thank you. Janice, you're the best. Hey! Trish! Merry Christmas! Cheryl! Welcome home! I didn't think you were gonna be able to get away. And miss a hometown Christmas? Not a chance. Has work lightened up at all? It's more like a black hole. Nothing escapes its gravitational pull. It's because it's so important. You fund cutting-edge research! Like that bio-fuel thing you were telling me about last year. That has major breakthrough potential, it could lead to sustainable energy! Well, I am just happy that you are here, and Mom and Dad can't wait to see you. Me too. Fold-out couch in the den, here I come. They stored most of the Christmas decorations, so it won't be like old times. What's this? What's what? "Trish's Bistro"? I took the plunge. I signed the lease yesterday. I open my restaurant in two weeks. Congratulations! You have been talking about that for years. Are you sure you're ready? Okay, go on. You might as well say it. I can tell you have something on your mind. It's just opening a restaurant is risky. And you've already tried it once. That was a snack shack, and I learned a lot from that experience! Exactly, so why repeat it? You're big-sistering me again. It's called looking out for you. Restaurants have a lot of competition, and a really slim margin, and it's just... it's such a big risk. Well, my restaurant has to succeed, 'cause I already bought 500 fondue forks! So fingers crossed. I really miss it here. In the city, you can barely see any stars. The Christmas Carnival starts tonight, right? Yep. Runs all five days till Christmas. You wanna check it out after dinner? Absolutely! I'm there. And it brings back such great memories. Nothing changes here. Hey, plenty changes. For instance, we finally finished the new city hall, thanks to the youngest mayor in town history. Terrence finally got what he wanted... Mm-hmm. I still haven't gotten used to the idea of someone else living in their house, but the new owners are really nice. You should meet them. I'm sure they are. I would just rather keep my memories of our house as it was. Mom and Dad needed to downsize. I know. Time moves on, no matter what I have to say about it. They may have downsized, but I see the snowman did not get the memo. Do not get in the way of Mom and her Christmas decorations. Okay. It's such a nice surprise. We missed you so much. Sweetheart, we're so happy you're home. Well, I couldn't miss another Christmas and by all the decorations, neither could you! These were just the ones I could squeeze in. Most of our lawn reindeer are in storage till we figure out what to do with them. Well, the best thing about your new place is it brings all of us closer together. I know it takes some getting used to. Like not seeing Grandma's crystal angel on top of the tree. I miss that, too. I put your luggage in the den. Honey, are you sure you don't mind sleeping on the fold-out couch? Of course not, Dad! Okay, dinner will be ready soon, guys. Perfect. Look what I found going through boxes today. Look, that's the year that we went caroling with the church choir. Ms. Nelson. That's the day I won the Science Fair. Remember? It's hard to believe she's been gone for five years. I just wish I'd seen her more. Well, you did always make a point to drop in on her at Christmas. Except for the last one. I was too busy. If only I'd known. Oh, honey, no one could have known about her heart condition. She was my inspiration. And look who's is in that photo. Is that George Campbell photobombing your victory shot? Oh, that's George, all right. He got runner-up. He never missed a chance to try to outdo me. Science fair, spelling bee, student body selections, George always had to prove he was better. Dinner's ready, guys! And I hope you're hungry! I am. Just remember to save room for dessert at the Carnival. 97 years, and the Carnival's still going strong. I love the Carnival. It's our own little snow globe, frozen in time... Over there's where I ran into Dr. Phillips five years ago... sent my life spinning in a whole new direction... Five years ago? That was the year the freak snowstorm hit, right? I remember. Closed all the roads out of Willoughby. We've had the most amazing volunteers this year... Speaking of the past, look who's here. ...and so, I'd like to thank everyone for making this new city hall a reality. And now, as Mayor of Wellsboro, it is my pleasure to declare this year's Christmas Carnival officially open! I still can't believe Terrence Fletcher is the mayor. Mayor or not, he's still cute. And still single. You should ask him out? Oh, we went on a date once, that same Christmas I ran into Dr. Phillips. You had a date with Terrence? What happened? It would have gone great, but... I spilled my latte on him, tripped him on the ice rink, and to top it off, he was allergic to my angora scarf... No wonder he never - called me back. Tree coming through! Hey! Look out! I'm so... Cheryl Jenkins! George Campbell. I should've known it was you. Why, 'cause I'm still bowling you over? No, because you're still causing me pain. I'm sorry. Hey, Trish! - How you doing? - Hi, George. You two catch up while I grab some popcorn. So, you in from D.C. for a bit? Just visiting the fam' for a week. Think this town's big enough for the both of us? I guess we'll find out. Let me guess. You're a lumberjack these days? No, no, no. I still teach over at the junior high. I just got this for the science club. Fitting you work with kids... since, clearly, you still are one. You still mad 'cause I let you win the science fair senior year? You "let" me win? You finally admitted it. You know, that's the first step to moving forward, right? Actually, the first step starts with my left foot, then my right. Then I let momentum carry me off. Merry Christmas, George. I'd say that your dynamic with George hasn't changed much since school. Friendly competitors, or competitive friends. If he only knew the truth. What, that you're a big success? On paper, maybe. In reality, not so much. You'll get back to your own work someday. It's too late. Somebody already found my comet. And besides, science moves at a gallop, and I'm five years out of date. But you are so good at your job! I only took it because I was waiting for an astronomy job to open up! Sometimes, I wonder what would've happened if I'd never run into Dr. Phillips. I wish I could live that week over again. Oh! Snafu with a delivery to the bistro. I'll be back - in a couple of minutes. - Okay. Hello? Anyone here? What? Whoa. - What's his name? - His name's Brigs. Hi, Brigs. Take care. Bye. Cheryl? You okay? Yes, I'm... I just got dizzy from the carousel, but... I'm fine. What carousel? Right up there. At the end of the Carnival. There's a carousel here? Okay, I have to run. Time for caroling, but take it easy, will you? Hey, Cheryl! Looking forward to Friday! What's happening Friday? Our date! Don't tell me you had second thoughts. No... I... hold on a second, Mr. Mayor... Mayor? You know I'm only running for City Council. But thanks for your vote of confidence. I'll see you Friday. Mayor... What is happening here? Wait, what are those posters? But... New Year's Ball? That poster's five years out of date. Yeah, I thought I heard your voice. What is it now, Cheryl? The font doesn't meet with your approval? George! Look at the poster! Looks fine to me. You should buy a ticket. The money goes to a new science lab at the high school. But you don't understand... Oh, hey, I spoke to your Mom last week. She says you just got your Master's. Congratulations. Just got it? Now, don't go getting all big-headed about it. I can still beat you at Scrabble. Excuse me. I have to go. This doesn't make any sense. It can't be. Ms. Nelson? George? What are you doing here? I was asking myself the same question. You passed out. And... you carried me here? Yeah. The nurse should be back any minute. You all right? I think so. Maybe some sugar will help. Technically, these are for the kids, but I'll grant an exception for an old friend. George... something's not right! I saw Ms. Nelson, here, at the carnival! Well, I think she's entitled to a break, she's been grading papers non-stop! And the date on the poster. Wanna fill me in, or you wanna play 20 questions? Look, I know this might sound crazy, but I have to tell you something important! And you have to swear not to laugh! - Okay. - No, seriously. Promise? I do solemnly swear not to laugh. Okay, so I got on the carousel, and everything was fine, but ever since I stepped off, things are really odd. It's almost like... Like? I'm back in time? You said you were not gonna laugh! Why am I wasting my time talking to you? Wait, where are you going? To find the carousel! Have you seen the carousel? Why are you following me? Well, a mixture of curiosity and concern. And when the guys with the white coats show up, they might need a hand. You sure you're all right? Yes. No. I'm not sure. But finding the carousel is gonna help. There's no carousel at this carnival. Why does everyone keep telling me that? I was on it! Well, I'm a volunteer this year, and I assure you, there's no carousel. It had moving horses and bright-colored lights! Like a carousel? Look, have you been hanging out at the eggnog booth, huh? Please! Okay. Here's another hypothesis. You've been working very hard on your thesis. Probably in need of some sleep? Let me drive you home to your parents' place. No... The night air is going to help me clear my head. Good night! Merry Christmas! This can't be. I just saw the new city hall. - Can I help you? - I'm sorry. I must've knocked on the wrong door. Do you know which unit Jeanette and Robert Jenkins live in? Sorry. No one here by those names. But I'm... I'm sure this is their complex. I head the HO8, miss. I assure you, there are no tenants named Jenkins here. I... I'm sorry. - Good night. - Good night. Oh, hey, honey. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do if this yard was any smaller. I just found Blitzen behind the old mower. What do you think, Cheryl? Um... it's great, Dad. I think so, too. Hey, how was opening night at the carnival? I think it's safe to say this year, it really stands out. Nice! Maybe we can go together tomorrow. I know you got to get back to Boston in the next few days. Boston? Don't you mean D.C.? Mm, the last I heard, you were living in Boston. Unless M.I.T. suddenly moved. Robert, I found some more lights! Oh! Cheryl, honey. Do you want to come in for some mulled cider? No... I'm okay... All right. Do you want to ask Ms. Nelson if she'd like some? Ms. Nelson? Yeah. Down the street? Yes. In the same house she's lived in for the past 30 years? Yes! Yes! I will! Good. Cheryl! Ms. Nelson? Merry Christmas to you, too! You're here! Yes, last time I checked. Yes, I'm here. Everything okay? It's just been a crazy evening, but... I'm better now. It feels like I haven't seen you in years! Well, you did see me last night when you were caroling. I, um... guess that time flies when you're having fun? Ms. Nelson, can I ask you a crazy question? Of course! It's not like you haven't done it before. Besides, scientific inquiry demands asking odd questions. - I got a doozy. - Okay. Do you think... maybe... time travel could be possible? Theoretically... yes, but "how"... that remains to be seen. Crazy as it sounds, I think I might've stumbled onto a breakthrough! And I want to hear all about it, but, honestly, right now, I am late for the faculty Christmas party at school, so... why don't we have some coffee and catch up tomorrow, and you can tell me all about it? That is if you have the time? Time? Oh, yeah. I've got about five years, give or take. Okay, so... I'm going to be marking papers all morning in my classroom, so why don't you just stop on by? Great. - Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow! Tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Can I have my hands back? - Of course. - Yes. - Ms. Nelson. - Yes, Cheryl. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Oh, my gosh! Wow. Remember the Christmas morning Trish and I brought the snowman inside? We put it right here! Yeah. As I recall, you didn't want it to catch a cold. The carpet you weren't so worried about. And Grandma's crystal angel. Before it shattered. There's so many amazing memories here. Do you remember the Christmas you stayed up all night? Most kids stay up to see Santa, you stayed up to see the Ursid Meteor shower! You always were naturally curious about everything! Are you okay, sweetheart? Yes. I'm just... I'm just happy to be home. I'd forgotten - how nice it is here. - Forgotten? You were just here a month ago for Thanksgiving. You know how quickly the holidays go. That's so true. Nothing makes time go faster than Christmas. Whenever I look at that staircase, I still half-expect to see you and your sister racing down in your jammies on Christmas morning. Mom... What would you do... if you could go back in time? What a question. Well, I suppose I would spend more time with friends and loved ones. Maybe fix a few old mistakes. And do the things I'd always regretted not doing. What an interesting idea. A chance... to change everything for the better. Oh! ♪ Christmas Eve ♪ The lights are glowing ♪ ♪ In the hallway And in my dreams ♪ ♪ Somewhere in my heart It's snowing ♪ ♪ In the place That still believes ♪ Ah, what's this? Oh, just in time, hon'. I made pancakes for your dad. And not just any pancakes... - Santa pancakes. - Santa pancakes. Mom, how do you manage to always make Christmas so special? It's just a matter of managing your time right. And that... is exactly what I plan to do! You're in a fine mood today. What can I say? I feel like I have a whole new lease on life! One thing. Promise not to leave the cat alone in here with the tree on Christmas. Mr. Tibbles? Why do you say that?'Cause he might knock the tree down and break Grandma's crystal angel. Just trust me, okay? Okay. If you say so. Oh, by the way, my friend, Sally, called. Her brother's in town this week for Christmas. He's the Director of the Federal Science Association! She thought the two of you might want to have a chat. There might be a job opening. I don't suppose his name is Dr. Phillips, by chance? Why, yes! Do you know him? Not yet. And let's keep it that way. Good morning! Hey, Trish. Are you working at the cafe today? What? I've been at the bakery since September. Today's my long shift. Right. Then can we meet for our pre-Christmas brunch tomorrow? Sure. Oh, you're taking off early. Yes. I'm off to get something. And what's that? A fresh start! Good morning, Mr. Johnson! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Cheryl. Oh, you might want to fix those rain gutters. Something tells me it's gonna be a wet spring! Thanks. I will. Hi, Terrence! Fancy meeting you here! - Yeah. - I have a feeling your run for councilman - is gonna go great. - Thanks, Cheryl. I like your positive outlook. And I'm sorry I wasn't myself last night. So you didn't forget our date? Of course not! I am definitely looking forward to it... this time around. Great, uh, then Friday at 7:00? Perfect. By the way, are you allergic to anything other than angora? No, no other allergies. I'll be sure to leave my angora scarf home. See you then. Cheryl, I am so proud of you. So tell me what's next? Well, there aren't any job openings at the big observatories right now, but this time around, I am going to wait as long as it takes. Well, when one becomes available, I know that you will be at the top of their Christmas list. Well, if I am, it's because I learned from the best. I really hope we can spend some time together this Christmas. Let me lighten the load so you can enjoy yourself more. Well, I have been pretty busy. I haven't even had time enough to take off to go get my own Christmas tree. What's that? I thought that classes were done for the semester. Oh, they are, but George teaches the after-school science club. Oh! That's surprisingly nice of him. Well, actually, I'm supposed to be helping him, but he's taken on most of the work. Let's go and peek in - and say hello. - Oh... He won't mind. Come on. So while you might think a white Christmas takes place only here on Earth, NASA has discovered ice in craters on the moon and beyond! Sorry. Don't let us disturb you. Uh. And then there's Saturn's moon, Enceladus. And Mars has ice on it, too. But a snowball fight there would mean putting up with temperatures over a hundred below. No. There... there would not be... Uh. What's that in the back there? - You were saying? - Nothing at all! Sorry. Carry on. You sure? I mean, if you have something you want to say, you should share it with the rest of the class. Oh... well... uh... the ice on Mars is carbon dioxide, not water. So if there were a snowball fight, it would feel more like tossing dry ice. Ouch. I think you're overthinking it. Maybe you're underthinking it. Class, we have a celebrity in our midst. This is Cheryl Jenkins, a former student here. Would you like to step to the front in class and share a few words with the students? Please, go ahead, Cheryl. I'm sure the class would love to hear from you! - Yeah. - Go on. Come on. Floor is yours. Well... I... have a degree in astronomy, and science offers so many careers... about as many as the stars in the sky... So cherish this time in your life because it goes by so fast, and you still have choices. One choice can set you on a path towards your passion, or down the wrong path, and you do not want that. Uh. Well... all I'm saying is... choose wisely. All right. I... I'm sure you definitely inspired the students. To what, I have no idea. Next time, I'll speak more slowly so you can keep up. Oh, no, I heard what you said. It's just I didn't get the point. Wouldn't be the first time. Students, what we have just experienced here is a perfect example of the scientific term "friction". And I have a wonderful idea. George, what do you think about Ms. Jenkins assisting you this week with science club? You want us to work together? Yeah, I... I don't think so. - Finally, we agree. - Cheryl... didn't you say you wanted me to have more time for my Christmas? Yeah, but I... It's settled. Thank you. Thank you, and carry on. Uh. Talk amongst yourselves. Cheryl! You just had to outdo me. You had to outdo me. You're blaming me for this? Of course! You know, we've got to work with one another, so... why don't we figure out a game plan? I've got to run an errand later. You want to come with? Fine. So, how are you enjoying the past? I was hoping you'd forgotten all that. What do you do in the future anyway? Are you asking because you believe me? Of course not. Well, if you must know, I happen to be Deputy Director of the Federal Science Association. Wow! When you have a delusion, you really go big. So who else have you talked to about this crazy time-traveling story? Only you, and after how that went, my secret goes no further. Wise choice. But now that you're stuck in the past, what are your plans? I know you don't believe me, but fine. I'm on a mission to make positive changes. - Such as? - If you must know, spend more time with Ms. Nelson, avoid a job I do not want, and help my sister get her life on track. Oh! I also have a date with Terrence the day after tomorrow. Terrence Fletcher? He was my secret crush in high school, and I think he liked me, too. And why's that? He asked to borrow my stapler once. That it? It was the way he asked to borrow it. Mm-hmm. And what's so great about Mr. Fletcher? Well, for starters, he's handsome, successful, and well-mannered. Well, if that's the kind of thing you're into. George, I'll say this for you. You always could get me to laugh. Hmm. So can we focus on the matters at hand? Like science club? Yes. As a favor to Ms. Nelson, I will allow you to assist me. I'll text you what we need to go over, so you can share your vast knowledge. And then we'll see who does it best. So we're competing again, huh? Just like old times. Then game on. Hey, perfect timing. I just finished my shift. I'm taking you to brunch, remember? So I heard you're doing science club with George this week? Not by choice, I assure you. I always thought George was cute. Like a puppy dog. Yeah... the kind that barks too much and eats your slippers. But let's talk about something happier. Oh, my gosh. That's him! That's who? Dr. Phillips! The guy Mom's friend wants me to meet! Well, for goodness sake, let's say hi! Dr. Phillips... Shh! He doesn't know what I look like, so let's just keep it that way. Shall we? And here I was thinking I was the crazy sister. Thanks again for brunch. Now... do you want to tell me what's going on here? I always know when something is up with you, and something is definitely up. What? We're here to enjoy ourselves. Just some sisterly brunch. Okay... and why do I feel some sisterly advice on the way? Why would I be giving you advice? You are naturally gifted. As a matter of fact, you could thrive if you tried something new. Thanks, I agree. The bakery is okay for now, but the truth is I'm thinking about opening up a restaurant. I've already started saving! Yeah, about that... What? It's awesome you're thinking ahead... but the thing is... most new restaurants fail by the first year. I just sent the links. That was quick. But... I never told you about my restaurant plans. Chalk it up to us being on the same sister wavelength. Okay, if you're looking to change careers, why not play to your strengths? You're a people person after all. So what about a career that leverages around your circle of friends? Like real estate or insurance? But, Cheryl... Just promise me you'll take a look at the links? I have to get back to science club. See you later. Ho, ho, ho. So as the temperature decreases, the sugar comes out of the solution, and that's how crystals are formed... or better yet... red and green rock candy! - Now, who wants some candy? - Yeah! All right. Pass these around. Top that. Moving on, I'll be explaining electrons. Christmas lights work by a simple idea. Particles called "electrons" travel through a wire, causing the filaments in the lights to glow. What's a "filament"? A filament is a conducting wire with a high melting point, which conveys electrons via thermionic emissions. It's simple, really. Let me show you the equation. The Bohr model in Newton's second law of motion... Cheryl! So, tell me, how did science club go today? Honestly? Kind of a trainwreck. Well, you want to come in and tell me all about it? Over a glass of Merlot? Yes. And Santa-size it, please? Step into my lab. So things didn't work out so good with science club, huh? I don't know how you do it. The secret to teaching... is making it fun. Easier said than done. Oh, well, it's not as difficult as you might think. For example... instead of me giving you a long chemistry lecture, what if I asked you... to make cookies? Every recipe is a chemical formula. You've got the sugar bonding to the gluten in the flour. There's the chocolate and the vanilla mixing together when you add just the right amount of heat. Chemistry. Hmm. You know... people can have chemistry, too... like you and George. Oh, please. What's the chemical formula for oil and water? You know, when you first moved away... George asked me about you all the time. Keeping tabs on the competition, I guess. You know, I really hope the two of you are enjoying working together, because from where I sit, you are very entertaining. You have always had a sense of humor. I just wish... I had your gift. You make teaching effortless. Okay. Well, here's another tip. If you can link an idea... to a happy memory... it'll stay with you forever. Ms. Nelson. You are more irreplaceable than you know. Thank you. Are you gonna sample these? - We must. - We must! We must. Oh, yes. And afterwards, I... I think I have a quick errand to run. Thank you for meeting me. Ms. Nelson still doesn't have a Christmas tree and... I...I have a truck and you need someone to drop it off, right? Ah! You know your future! So do you think I got through to any of the students today? It's hard to tell. I think you lost a few of them around the "thermionic emissions" part. Well, I admit it, I'm not much of a teacher. Now you tell me! But I do have a great idea for science club tomorrow. You gonna go back in time and... keep yourself from delivering that lecture? I know you still don't believe me, but isn't the foundation of science to have an open mind? Science is about proof. You want proof? If I remember right, this week, a freak snowfall closed a main road between here and Willoughby. This week's forecast is nothing but clear, sunny skies. We'll see. This one's pretty nice. That's a way better tree over there. - You're doing it again. - Huh? Every single time I do something, you always have to try to outdo me. No, that's all in your head. The academic decathlon, the 4-H competition. Oh, I could go on... You remember all of that? That's just proof that you've been jealous of me ever since back in high school. What? You've always been jealous of me! Please. I love my life. Do you? Okay, fine. I admit it. My life is far from perfect. But this week, I have a second chance. And I'm gonna make a difference. Starting with getting Ms. Nelson that tree... - Oh, watch out! - Oh! Ah! I'd say... the weather has changed. Well, that's hardly proof. Time will tell. Thank you. All right, follow me. We're having science club at the carnival? Yeah, my thoughts exactly. Watch and learn. A carnival is a perfect example of science in action. The centrifugal force of the Ferris wheel, and over here... the Berry-Go-Round may seem just like a carnival ride, but it illustrates Newton's laws in action... A berry in motion stays in motion unless acted on by an external force. Now, give me an example of the third law. Like in football, For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction? Maybe when two players collide, the ball flies loose? You've got it! Okay, notepads out. I want all of you to write down every kind of motion you see around you! Okay? Go for it! Phew! Seems like somebody's improved her teaching skills a bit. Why do your compliments always sound like you're teasing? Maybe you just hear it that way. Well then, thank you. Maybe I just wish I was in their shoes, being a student again and having time to gaze up at the stars. I guess somehow I lost my way. So how goes your mission to change the future? And yes, I'm humoring you. Fine then, I'll play along. The future's looking up, thank you. I've been inspiring my sister with career ideas, and I have my big date with Terrence tonight. And how about me, how's my future look? Oh, I think it's safe to say you haven't changed a bit. I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult. Maybe a little bit of both. You know, I always felt like our competition brought out the best in each other. - Seriously? - Yeah. I love competing against you. Why? It was exhausting! Maybe I needed a kick in the pants. When I was in first year of high school, I was barely getting passing grades. Then they stuck us in a class together, we were off to the races. But of all people, why choose me to compete with? Because you were the best. Really? Don't let it go to your head. How about we settle this lifetime of competition once and for all? And how do you suggest we do that? Okay. Two, please? You first. All right, you asked for it. Ooh. Yes! - All right. - That one, please. Just to show no hard feelings, I'll share my prize. Cheryl Jenkins, you are generous to a fault. Excuse me. Cheryl Jenkins? I've been leaving you messages. I'm Dr. Phillips! - Nice to meet you. - This is my niece, Emma. She's been giving me the grand tour of your carnival. I'm so sorry. I've just been busy. Uh... this is George. - Nice to meet you, doc. - And you. Well, Cheryl, you know, I was starting to think that you and I were destined to keep missing one another. You know, I've heard some wonderful things about you. I'd really appreciate it if we could sit down sometime soon and talk. Oh, really? I'll tell you what, how's tomorrow at Holly's Cafe? Say 10:00 a.m.? I wish I could, but I'm lending a hand at the junior high and... No, no, no. That's okay. We can spare the time if you guys need to grab a coffee. Perfect. Well then, until tomorrow. - See you then. - You bet. What... what did I do? It's okay, you were just trying to help. I'd better head out. For your dream date with Terrence? Have fun. Yeah, I'll hold down the fort. Here, try this one on. Thanks, sis. - That's gorgeous. - Mm-hmm. Wow. Thanks. You know, I'm impressed. Only in town a few days and you've already got dates and a job interview. Not bad. How did you know I have an interview? Mom says you have a meeting with that science guy about a job. We'll see about that. Did you see the snowman I built out front? You mean the one holding brochures for a real estate workshop? It's the season of giving! Just promise me you'll give it some thought. Fine. You look great. All ready for your big date? You bet. I'm not leaving anything to chance. This time when destiny calls, I am not letting it go to voicemail! Okay. You look fantastic. And this place is great... Yes, the chef here's amazing. People wait months for a reservation here. Didn't they just open last week? I just meant... I sense good things for this place. Well, it does seem like the perfect choice for tonight. And it's got a no-slip floor, so, less chance of falls. No open flame. And no nuts on the menu. So, it is risk-free. I... uh... - called ahead? - Oh. A bottle of your best unoaked Chardonnay, please. - Right away. - You do like Chardonnay, right? Sure. That's fine. It's so funny, us, together. I feel like we never got a chance to talk back in high school. Well, I always wanted to talk to you, but you were always off, hiding in the lab! Guilty as charged. And anyways, you were always off with your buddies. Right! Though it was really just building a network of friends and supporters that I have today, so. Of course. I didn't mean to... The point is we never really had time to talk. Until now. All the time in the world. Finally. No distractions. No distractions at all. Hey, they have crab cakes! Oh. um... great! So... any plans for Christmas? Oh, of course, I'll be at the carnival every day. You know, to me, the carnival is like one big Christmas banquet that brings the whole town together. I love how you put that. And that's what makes it so great for networking. Instead of going door to door, everybody's right there! Bingo! Right. Bingo. So, how about you? How have you been spending Christmas? I've been helping out the junior high school science club. And finding it surprisingly fun. Well, like I always say, children are the future. And after all, every child's a future constituent! Am I right? No. I haven't thought of them that way. Oh, hey. That's the editor of the Wellsboro Times. I should go say hi. How do I look? I'll be right back. Hey! Bobby! Would you care to hear any more about our specials? Thanks, but I think I've heard enough already. Hey! There she is. - Hey. - Heading home? Yes, but I took the long way. I always love seeing how the store windows are decorated for Christmas here. Yeah. Me too. You want some company? Honestly, I could use some. Okay. So, don't hold out on me. How'd your date with Terrence go? Kind of a disaster. No matter where I steered the conversation, Terrence just... steered it back to himself! Yeah. I never thought much of Terrence. You dodged a bullet. I always thought Terrence and I would click. Such a waste of a good chin. Life loves surprises. What do you mean? Well, like for me, after college, I always figured I'd be headed off to Med school, and then I accidentally found a job I loved right under my nose. I always wondered why you never followed through on your plans. Well, in a way, I did. I only got into teaching 'cause... it gave me time to study for the MCATs. Then something clicked teaching the kids. You're still helping people, just in a different way. I wish I felt that good about my job. Speaking of which, I'd... I'd better head home. I have that job interview with Dr. Phillips tomorrow. You want to nail it. No, I need to botch it! If I take that job, it takes me away from everything I love. This town, science, my dreams. Well, in that case, I wish you the worst of luck. Thanks, because I'm gonna need it. Hi. Cheryl. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Thanks for finding the time to meet with me. To be perfectly honest with you, when my sister first asked me to talk to you about this job, I agreed, really, more as a favor. Most of my other interviews in D.C. have been with top specialists in their field. Sure, I understand. You probably want an experienced professional for this job. I do. Yes. But then I asked around and I've read the papers that you published, including the one about the comet. You have this wonderful and unique ability to combine math, physics, chemistry, even philosophy. You clearly have a very broad range of knowledge. I guess I'm naturally curious about everything. It's exactly that quality that makes you a perfect candidate for a new job opening that we have at the Science Association. Let me guess. A job in grant evaluation? With a chance of advancement in a couple of years? You have clearly done your homework. You know, you are every bit as sharp as I've heard. To be fair, I may have gotten a hint. But I should warn you, Dr. Phillips, some of my colleagues say I can be stubborn. Well, to get things accomplished, one must be, at times. Some might even say I don't work well with others. Well, that's perfect, because in this position, you're going to have to get used to saying no to people a lot! And what would you say if I take long naps at work? Well, I guess I would say you have got a wonderful sense of humor. I'm honored you think I'm right for the Association. I think that you would be absolutely perfect for this job. I am just not a fit. Now, why am I not surprised that negotiation is just another one of your many talents? But I am not negotiating. - Really! - Of course. Look, let me look into this a little bit more, and see what I can do to sweeten the offer. But you don't have to... Ms. Jenkins, I always say as scientists, we know that even the impossible is possible, with a little creative thinking. I've taken care of the check. Cocoa's on me. But you will definitely be hearing from me again soon. Cheryl. That was fast. I'm surprised to see you. Someone looks deep in thought. Job interview didn't go well? Actually, kind of the opposite. But that's great. Right? You would think so, but the truth is not exactly. I'm late for work. Speaking of work, did you check out the real-estate pamphlets I left for you? No, I haven't had time. But what's with all the career counseling lately? Your future is important to me, and I know what it means to make a mistake. But the thing is I'm not you. Cheryl, it's up to me to choose what's right for my future, and if you can't see that, then I'm... I'm sorry. But Trish, I'm just trying to help! Thanks for meeting me here. I'm not much of a holiday shopper, and I need to get a gift for Ms. Nelson. Honestly, I could use a good distraction, and I always loved this old place. Treasures from a different time. Yeah. Well, you know what good ol' Einstein said about time. "There's never enough time to finish all of my holiday shopping." He never said - anything of the sort. - What, were you there? No, don't answer that. You probably were. Speaking of which, how's your mission to change the future going? About as smoothly as the Big Bang. I just... I thought Trish always wanted my advice, and it turns out she doesn't at all. The more I try to help her, the more she pulls away! Not so easy, huh? That's putting it mildly. Trish is upset, my date with Terrence went south, and now Dr. Phillips wants to sweeten an offer for a job that I don't even want! I thought I could change things. It seems like I'm fighting fate. I... I guess I have to try harder. Or you could stop trying. But if you can change the future, wouldn't you try? The way I see it... why fight fate? Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. Not if I can help it. What about this? This is really special. Ms. Nelson will love it. Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Yeah. Thank you. At least somebody can use my help today. There's that smile. You're feeling better already. Let's get this wrapped. You know, you have a kind side that I never fully appreciated before. Well, that's probably because we were always trying to outdo each other. You've always been one-of-a-kind. I remember in school, when I was struggling, and I saw this curious dynamo with a pink backpack... you lived and breathed learning, and I... that made me feel like I could, too. Even after you left, I missed... Competing with me? Yeah. Or maybe I just missed you. After you left, I tried to forget about you, but... easier said than done. I also have a confession to make. Okay. Maybe I missed you, too. Really? What can I say? There's... no one in the world I like arguing with more than you. Well, that makes two of us. That storm front should be on its way. No. I saw the weather report. Sun and warm temperatures are coming our way. So, you still don't believe me about predicting the future? Well, think about it. If the snowshoe was on the other foot, would you? Probably not. I just got a news alert. "The cold front heading north has changed course." "Wellsboro will get dusted, but expect major flurries tonight in Willoughby." How about that? To celebrate our last meeting of the term, it's time for a Christmas party with a little holiday science thrown in. Over there, you can observe how dipping candy canes in hot water causes them to dissolve faster. - Want to pass these out, Jake? - Or you could just eat the experiment. I think you might be a teacher after all. Couldn't have done it without you. Speaking of which, I could use your help with something after this, too. Okay. Sure. Thank you both so much for coming over to help me decorate! Happy to... though someone seems to not know the main rule... first come the lights, second comes the ornaments? Wow. See, this is how it is in the classroom, I stand still while she runs circles around me. And I get to sit here and relax and thank you both for helping me out with science club. Oh, it was a blast. Once I started channeling my favorite teacher, it went great. All right, everybody ready to see how it looks? - You bet. - Oh, yes. Oh! It's beautiful. - It sure is. - Oh, I just about forgot... got you a little Christmas present. Oh... It's a little something me and Cheryl got for you. Thank you, both. Oh! It's precious! I love it! - Thank you! - You're welcome. I should check on dinner. You sure you don't need help in there? I don't mind sharing the classroom with you, but I draw the line at sharing the kitchen. You and George make a great team. And who'd have predicted we'd be able to get along so well? Hmm. It's important to hold onto the good people you meet in this life. Are those some of the students you've taught science to? Just a few of my thousand little stars. I had my hands full doing this for a week. But doing it for years? It has to be exhausting. On the contrary. Teaching, molding young minds, introducing them to the magic of science. Oh, that never seemed like work to me, never. And if I had my life to live all over again... I wouldn't change not one thing. Funny. That's a question I have been thinking a lot about this week. - Mm-hmm. - Ms. Nelson, if someone knew the future, if, by chance, you could go back in time, would you want to know what's in store? Well... if all of that could happen... here's what I'd say... The future... is like a big present underneath the Christmas tree. Why ruin the surprise? But if it was really important... Cheryl... let's just be present... and enjoy today. Oh! I was doing a little shopping, you know, buying a few new ornaments... and I got... this one for you. Just a little something to help you remember this week. "Teachers help us grow." Ms. Nelson, thank you. And when you look at that... remember me, and it's gonna be like I'm right there with you. I'll treasure it. Always. Great job with the tree back there. I don't know, I thought we were starting to get a little carried away. No such thing when you're decorating a Christmas tree. It's a beautiful night. What is it about winter nights that make the stars so clear? Cold air doesn't hold as much moisture, so there's less interference. Right. I almost forgot I was speaking to an actual astronomer. You know, I went into science because I loved looking at the stars but seeing the students so excited this week it... it reminded me of how I used to be. Yeah. I was hoping you'd get to see how the kids' eyes light up. You know, you've got a real knack for this teaching thing. Add that to my list of surprises this week. I never thought I'd enjoy teaching so much. You know... these past few days have definitely been eye-opening. Did you ever think your path would lead you home? On a more permanent basis? Stranger things have happened, and... I do love it here. Well... maybe the question is... what do you want to have in your life? You figure that out, you'll know where you want to end up. ♪ Silent Night♪ ♪ Holy Night ♪ All is calm... ♪ I tried to put you out of my mind after you left. Here we are. This week has been full of surprises. And how's that? Well... maybe everything I assumed about my life was wrong. I was wrong about Terrence... teaching, and... Hmm. ...my sister as well, but... most of all, I couldn't see what was right in front of me all along. What was that? You. ♪ Silent Night ♪ ♪ Holy Night... ♪ I should... - I should get that. - Yeah. Of course. Dr. Phillips wants to meet ASAP. He's headed back for D.C. for Senator Mullins' Christmas Eve party. You know what you're gonna tell him? You know... I think I finally know exactly what I want. Want to meet me after? At the carnival? I'll be there. Well, she still hasn't given me an official answer, but I'm hoping I'll get one soon, yeah. Dr. Phillips? Let me call you right back. Cheryl, thank you so much for coming to meet with me. Of course. I just want to say how much I appreciate you wanting me for this job, but I...Before you say anything else, I've been doing some thinking as well, which is why I've managed to pull a few strings, move some budget items around, and get you a higher salary. It isn't the money. I assure you, it's just... with this job, I won't have enough time for my own research. I understand. I do. You need to figure out what it is that makes you happy. It's just such a shame. I mean, I really believe that you could make a real difference. - What do you mean? - Well, all the other candidates for this position are either bureaucratic types, or specialists in their field, but none of them... none of them possess the wide range of knowledge that you have, or the keen eye for research that I believe could one day change the world. I'm sure they can evaluate the merit of projects. It's more a case of which ones have powerful backers behind them. To be perfectly honest, I'm afraid that important research could fall through the cracks. I... I didn't think of that. Look, Cheryl, I'll need an answer by tomorrow morning at the latest and I really hope it'll be a yes. Hey... Hey. So... what did Dr. Phillips say when you turned down the job? He didn't say anything because... I didn't say no. I'm going to take the job. So you're going to D.C.? I can't tell you why, but I have to. Okay. So that's it, then? Weren't you the one who told me you don't believe in trying to change fate? Yeah, but, you know, that was before... Try as I might, maybe I can't change the future at all. I get it. Hey, Trish. I thought I could find you here. The bakery made extra goodies for Christmas. The candy-cane cookies are my creation, but to you, I suppose I'm just wasting my life. I'm sorry, Trish. So, are you here to give me more advice? How can I? I think I'm the one that needs to hear some. My big sister needs my advice? I've made so many mistakes... and... I'm only seeing things clearly now, and I want to say... I'm sorry. For what? For trying to change you. We're sisters. Who knows what our future holds for either of us, and God knows, my life isn't perfect. And going forward, I can promise one thing... I will support you in whatever dreams you go after. So please just let me know how can I do that for you? You just did. - Ms. Nelson? - Hmm? I brought you some candy-cane cookies, courtesy of Trish. Oh! You're so thoughtful. - Thank you. - I just needed an excuse to see you. You never need an excuse to see me. What's wrong? I think I may have made the biggest mistake of my life. If I don't take the job in D.C., all the projects I'll help launch may never happen. What projects? I'm sorry. I can't explain more, but just... just trust me on this. Well, I can't say that I completely understand, but, um... I get the feeling that there's a secret ingredient to this formula that you are not sharing. You know me so well. George is... so funny, and smart, and great to hang out with... And it's easy to see he feels the exact same way about you. I never noticed how wonderful he is, before now. I... I don't know what to do. I don't even know if George has the same feelings that I do. Well, have you told him how you feel? - Not completely, no. - Well, then there's no time like right now. If you do not want to have regrets, then you have got to seize the day! You've got to tell people how you really feel. And don't waste another minute. You know, you're right. Hmm. Starting with you. Thank you for everything. For who I am. Who I will be. Thank you. And you're welcome. Cheryl... you are my brightest star. Now I just need to find George. He did tell me that he was headed to the carnival. You know, it's the last night. I think you could find him there. Go. But I...Go. Mm-hmm. Have you seen George? Yeah, I just saw him in the food court. Thank you. George! I need to talk to you! Cheryl, what's going on? I have to tell you something! Something I should have realized years ago! Okay, I just ordered some ice cream. Can you hold that thought? Make it two? George! Look! It's here! Come on! Follow me! George! Come see! It's here! This is what I was telling you all along! Oh, no, it's happening! It's happening again! No! It's too soon! George! George! I think I'm falling in love with you! Excuse me. Is this the Jenkins' house? They moved to a condo over on Third Street. Right, I know where they are now. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. I'm back. Hello? Sorry to bother you, but... Janice, is this you? It's so good to hear your voice. But I just saw you this afternoon. Then it's the same day... Listen, I just wanted to make sure you got home okay. Yes! And... I had a little time to think things over. In the new year, we're going to talk about you getting a well-deserved promotion. You can do so much more. But... Cheryl... I'm not sure I have your gift for spotting talent. Why not? I found you, and if you're game, I want you to take on a bigger role. Wow! Really? - I'd love that! - You deserve it. We'll talk later, but for now... Merry Christmas! Mom? Dad? You here? Of course! - Mom, Dad! - Oh! - It's so good to see you! - Oh, honey, you're squeezing the air out of me. It just feels like it's been ages. Honey, let me get you some hot cider. You look cold. Hey. Where'd you go? You look different. I guess you can say I... wandered off for a while. Well, you are just in time because we are about to sample my restaurant's new menu! Trish! Everything looks incredible! And you better save me a seat on opening night, 'cause it is going to be a huge success. Mm-hmm. Let's eat! Good job, Terrence. New city hall. Just as it should be. And I'll be first in line. Beautiful night. George? Is this a dream? Not yet. You forgot your scarf. I've been holding onto it for five years. You mean, you were waiting for me? Yeah. Well, you know what they say... time flies when you're having fun. But what happened! You heard me? I heard enough. And... I think I'm falling in love with you, too. I just had to wait for you to catch up. But I thought you didn't believe in changing fate. I was wrong. - You were? - Yeah. You made me realize that some things are worth fighting for. Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, today is a gift. That's why they call it the present. Just got off the phone with Dr. Phillips. He is down with my plan. Five years was enough. - You didn't quit, did you? - No, I just reminded Dr. Phillips of something he said a long time ago... even the impossible is possible, with a little creative thinking. And I'm staying here! So, wait, you're going to be able to work from Wellsboro? Three days a week, and Dr. Phillips is recommending me for a position in the astronomy department at Wellsboro College, spending half of my time here, and having the best of both worlds. Oh, honey! Honey, that is wonderful! And I know Ms. Nelson would be so happy for you if she were here. Maybe she is. Thank you. You know... the carnival's going to be open for another hour tonight. You wanna go? That is, if you can spare the time? Hmm. Well, the way I see it... I've got all the time in the world. ♪ Lights on the trees Under fallen snow ♪ ♪ You get a bit closer When the winter's cold ♪ ♪ Wherever you go You light up the room ♪ ♪ I hope that you'll make it Back home soon ♪ ♪ 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you ♪
