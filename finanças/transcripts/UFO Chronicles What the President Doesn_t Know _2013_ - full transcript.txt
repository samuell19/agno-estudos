[upbeat music] - Steven Spielberg had obtained a number of real UFO case files, for which elements were to be used in these Close Encounters of the Third Kind movie. Certain scenes were based on real events, including elements of the paranormal. One such real encounter involved the family that were played by Poltergeist type disturbances prior to having the UFO experience. This Spielberg portrayed in the movie when a child was taken by extraterrestrials from his home, electrical devices strung to life, taps turned on and objects flew across the kitchen. Again, this was also seen earlier in the movie when toys suddenly turn themselves on. Spielberg wanted this particular movie to portray the real aspects of this phenomenon in a way never before seen. - [Narrator] It's widely known that Spielberg is a major campaign contributor to the political party, and to have spoken in depth about UFO's and aliens with three presidents, namely Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, all of which had their own personal UFO sightings. It was wireless, a private screening of ET in the White House that Reagan whispered in Spielberg's ear, You know, there aren't six people in this room who know how true this really is. Suspicions also surround a guest appearance in the movie by the grand formalism modern euphology, J. Allen Hynek, who quietly smokes his pipe and watches the neon light clad alien craft landing before initial contact is made with gray alien beings. It is fitting that Hynek makes an appearance in the movie as it is he who supplied the classification of UFO sightings, which gave the film its title. In his early career Hynek, an astrophysicist was a scientific advisor to the much maligned U.S Air Forces Investigations into unidentified flying objects, Project Sign from 1947 to 1949, Project Grudge, 1949 to 1952 and the often spiteful and pernicious Project Blue Book, 1952 to 1961. Although initially a skeptic, it was while interviewing witnesses and investigating UFO cases that he had a change of heart and began to take the prospect of genuine unknown seriously. And as a result went on to found the much a claim center for UFO studies, CUFOS. - From 1952 to 1970, the United States Air Force investigated 12,618 UFO incidents, under the operational name as Project Blue Book, almost every page of the 12,000 plus case files had large black mark censoring information that could be used to cross-check Project Blue Books controversial work. For many years, Blue Books, most vocal opponents have insisted that the standards by which cases were allegedly explained were grossly unscientific. Blue Books goal, according to those who held it in low esteem was to attach some explanation to every case, regardless of logic or even common sense. The urgency in which Blue Book officials tag answers onto cases without having done any proper investigation is pretty obvious, though not proven. But if the air force was so eager to label case files as identified, despite the lack of supporting evidence, then those few cases which had been labeled unidentified, presumably withstood all attempts to apply every kind of explanation. - [Narrator] Another widely believed conspiracy surrounding close encounters, which simply will not go away is that the movie is based on a real event that took place decades ago in New Mexico in 1955. Years before the now infamous Roswell salsa crash. Another alleged incident took place 50 miles outside, Cape Girardeau, Missouri in spring 1941, when a downed flying sourcer and its occupants were recovered. This prompted the first meeting between an alien race, the Grays who claimed to come from Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system, some 39 light years away and humans, recently, some very dubious videos have begun to appear on YouTube, which prepare to show the first meeting with an alien that has come to be known as Skinny Bob. However, it is a curious and often confusing incidents, which took place in 1955 at Holman AFB, home of the 49th tactical wing, situated in the high desert of New Mexico, which really captures the imagination as if it was ever proven, the implications for humanity would be truly astounding. In February, 1954, President Eisenhower had sneaked away from his duties as Commander in Chief, to enjoy a weekend of golf at the Smoke Tree Ranch Resort in Palm Springs, during his Ike seemingly vanished causing rumors to spread through the following journalists that he had suddenly been taken ill and had died. A cover story was put in place detailing how one of his dental caps had come loose, prompting an unscheduled visit to his dentist. In fact, if the story is to be believed and let's face it, it's a fantastic one, he had slipped away to meet with small Gray aliens who heralded from Zeta Reticuli, who called themselves the Etherians, at moroch later known as Edward CFB. It was at this meeting that the president presumably made some extremely poor decisions. Perhaps his judgment was fatally flawed when faced with their advanced technology. For whatever reason, President Eisenhower signed the treaty of Greada, which would see the Athenians given carte blanche to harvest human DNA in what is now become known as alien abductions in exchange for advanced alien technology. It was an agreement which he would come to regret as within months, it became crystal clear that they had broken the treaty and were abducting humans on a global scale. - It was February the 21st, 1954 when President Eisenhower allegedly signed the Greada Treaty after a meeting with alien Grays. The Greada Treaty was an official agreement that one, the U.S government is to swear secrecy of the alien presence on earth. Two, the U.S government may be furnished with information and advanced technology. Three, a quota for biological specimens must be met, which also includes human biology. And four, a quota of biological converts are to be returned to their point of origin with no recollection of any event imposed. Allegedly, it was long before Eisenhower was met by aliens for the second time. - [Narrator] It was to be almost exactly a year later that another meeting was to take place with ETs, this time claiming to come from Betelgeuse, Alpha Orionis, a red supergiant, which is the eighth brightest star in the night sky. On the 9th of February, 1955, President Eisenhower announced that he was going quail hunting tree of the treasury, George Humphrey and Clifford Roberts, and would be staying at Humphreys Cottage in Georgia. At 4:30 p.m, Air Force One, a Columbine three airplane carrying the president, took off closely followed by a second plane full of press officers and journalists. The quail hunt was brought to an abrupt end when the heavens opened and it began to pour down. So the president retreated to the warmth and safety of Humphreys Cottage. His press, Secretary James Haggerty, reported to the gathered massive journalists that I could come down with a bad case of the sniffles and was sheltering at the cottage playing bridge. While the press party, the night away, President Eisenhower, crept away, unseen and flew overnight to Holloman AFB, where he had a prearranged meeting to keep with alien beings. For the next 33 hours, the whereabouts of President Eisenhower would remain a mystery that exists to this very day. The Base Commander Colonel Sharp seems to have been kept in the dark as to the arrival of the ETs at his base appears to have totally caught him off guard. At 5:32 a.m the basis dopplar radar picked up three unidentified contacts entering their controlled airspace and tried repeatedly to contact him, warm them of the dangers without receiving a response. After receiving nothing but static hase, three fighter planes were ordered to intercept the unknowns while Colonel Sharp contacted Edwards AFB and Wright Patterson, to ask whether they were testing any top secret military aircraft in their vicinity. When the answer came back that they had nothing in the air that moment, he brought the base to a state of red alert. The radar tracked three objects in all, two of which flew close together while a third followed on some five minutes behind them. As luck would have it, a helicopter that was on routine photographic missions was approaching Holloman and took film of the objects as they pass them by. They were described as being 25 to 30 feet across, were brightly polished silver in color sourcer shaped and wobbled as they flew. Another camera crew on the ground ran off 600 feet of film. As one of the objects descended in front of the Sun Australia's mountains and quickly approached the base, segments of this film were apparently supplied to all throw and filmmaker, Robert Emennegger for inclusion in his military sanctions, UFO documentary, UFO's Past Present and Future. Finally, the salsa hovered 10 feet above the ground wobbled as three tripod legs descended before it landed with a hiss. Even as it was sapling on the ground, Colonel Sharp and two unnamed bay scientists were hastily crossing the tarmac towards the landing craft. As they near the door opened in the sight of the UFO before three beings descended steps and approached the base commander and his two aides. The alien beings were described as being small in stature, light blue in color, had a prominent pointed nose and wore a rope like a headband. They also spoke perfect English. Their message was clear, under no conditions should we trust the Grays from Zeta Reticuli, but of course, President Eisenhower, who was at that very moment, racing towards the base had already made a deal with them. Their warning was near on exactly a year late. At 9:00 a.m, Air Force One touchdown at Holloman and the pilot Major Bill Draper taxied the plane 75 yards back down the runway. So it was this far away from the array of buildings and hangers as was possible. No sooner had the aircraft engines fell silent than the two UFO's quickly approached. One of which stayed airborne surveying the scene while the other landed some 200 feet in front of the president's plane. A door on the side of the sourcer opened and President Eisenhower hastily left his plane and rushed across to the craft before entering without hesitating. It seems clear that Ike trusted these aliens, which he may have already previously met as he ventured into the sourcer alone without his security. For 40 minutes, the president and the aliens conversed about the dangers of nuclear weapons and stressed how these Zeta Reticuli Gray aliens should not be trusted. The aliens offered to share their technology as long as he promoted peace and decommissioned his nuclear missiles. But this was rejected as the cold war was getting colder with each passing day. America could not leave itself unprotected. After the meeting, the aliens unceremoniously left as quickly as they had appeared, an Air Force One was dragged into a hangar where the president and Colonel Sharp gave a brief talk to the 225 air force personnel at a connecting supply hanger concerning security. In essence, they were warned not to say anything or even speak about the events of the day. It said that between 1953 and 1955, Dwight D. Eisenhower met with three different races of aliens and that he saw his first UFO while a border ship of the British coast in 1952. In fact, Eisenhower's name has become synonymous with the UFO subject. It's also a fact that at this time, UFO and alien fever became viral and caught the imagination of the general public. The age of alien abduction had well and truly arrived. The number of abductees and animal mutilations began to sore, our national security seemingly clamped down on UFO sightings, sometimes going to ludicrous lens to ridicule witnesses and dismiss their stories of meeting beings from beyond the stars. Over 60 years later, as the trendy euphologists meekly call on governments around the globe to discuss what they know about the subject of UFO's. The impenetrable cloak of shows, no signs of lifting. - So if a treat you talk place, did it go wrong? Did we get far more than what we bargained for? Is it now out of control? These are just a few of the questions researchers often ponder. Can we really trust anything we are being told? According to hundreds, if not thousands of witnesses, it would seem ETs regularly deliver the same message. Lack is a protocol to tell us the same thing over and over preserve and protect the earth. It was seen not the ETs, if that's what they truly are, don't seem to care so much about us, but rather our planet. Are these messages of concern for humanity or something else. - [Narrator] One wonders whether the coverup is to hide alien reality or to continue to conceal the fact that the 34th president of the United States, Dwight D Eisenhower, a hero to all Americans and the commanding five-star general in the European theater of operations, an honorable man known for his decisive actions is responsible for selling out the human race and causing misery and mental torment to those who are openly ridiculed for claiming to have been snatched from the warmth of reality by alien beings. - There's been many times when the UFO phenomenon is somehow connected with the paranormal. And when we look at these scholar experiment, or certainly the continued experiments that took place in Scotland some years after school finished, it was very interesting. What we had was a number of incidents that actually took place regarding UFO's and the paranormal. And in these circumstances, we had a situation where the mediums were sat in a circle and objects manifested drawing this circle science. These objects were, well, they were they're described as miniature UFO's. I mean the small flying disks, they couldn't be explained. I mean, it was quite profound that these things were seemed to be like a bright orangy Amber color around them. But the witnesses clearly saw that these were dish shaped objects, and there were several of them flying around the rooms, quite slowly, even one of the people there said that they saw one of these things land on the hand and had no weight or feel to it. These strange lights continued for quite some time. There has also been a number of incidents where controlled communications have taken place. Joining these experiments with what is referred to as some type of entities. Entities that refer to themselves as inter dimensional beings. So you and me, we might refer to these things as aliens or extraterrestrial. And it's certainly interesting that certain things did turn upon photographs and video film during the original skull experiment in Norfolk where these strange faces appeared. In fact, it actually looked quite alien, gray looking, except it had a blue tinge, hence its name was blue, but it did have the stereotypical large black eyes. Now wasn't the first time these things were apparently experienced. It has been another occasion doing no particular experiment when they have communications with entities claiming to be from other dimensions or the worlds. And of course that there was a huge amount which will want wanting to come through. And it is speculated the reasons why skull experiment came to an end in Norfolk is because the mediums actually, who started to lose control over what they were actually communicating with. If that's the case, then we have to query what was it they were referring to? Well, who were they talking with? And of course, really are these extraterrestrials or inter dimensionals are really dealing with. Nevertheless, it really is a problematic subject when we're trying to work out what the UFO phenomenon really represents. From small strange objects and lights to two gigantic ships in the sky. What did he really represent? And we really don't know, looking back at Project Blue Book files, researchers from around the world, including myself, are not being convinced about what Blue Books conclusions reached. When you actually start to look for report forms. I mean, any UFO investigator knows when you go and talk to witnesses, you've got to compel a UFO report form. You can't commit all this to mind. And there was in fact, a proper UFO report form, a standardized report form, which was used by blue book investigators, where are those report forms? Because when you start to realize that they were dealing with 12,618 cases and 701 unknowns, where all those reports? They wasn't done simply because they didn't really care. I don't think they were very interested. I think what Blue Books officers were trying to do is just trying to disprove anything that came across their desk as having some type of mundane explanation. And the reason being is that they wanted to portray the UFO phenomenon to be nothing more than crazy kooky stories, fake things, and misidentifications of birds and clouds and the planet Venus and nothing more. But I'll tell you now, that was far from the truth. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] From 1952 to 1970, the United States Air Force investigated 12,618 UFO incidents under the operational name of Project Blue Book. - People have asked me about Project Blue Book many times. Is it legitimate, more so since the new television service came out, I've always stuck with the same old answer. I mean, no, I don't believe it was. I think it was just something put forward to ease public concern. I don't believe that they even wanted to find out what the UFO phenomenon represented. Maybe you already knew, at the end of the day, it didn't seem that they put so much money into that project. Neither, it didn't really consist of much more than a couple of desks, telephones and little things on the wall at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The whole thing about Project Blue Book, was to make it look really impressive when in fact, not a lot really went on. In fact, even the official report forms that most of UFO investigators use, Project Blue Book covers just wasn't even bothered having none filled out most of the time. And of course, where he was critical and interesting information, a lot of that was blacked out. So what did we really get out of Project Blue Book? No at all. - [Narrator] Almost every page of the 12,000 plus case files had large black marks censoring information that could be used to crosscheck Project Blue Books controversial work. For many years, Blue Books most vocal opponents have insisted that the standards by which cases were allegedly explained were grossly unscientific. - Whether you are frozen extraterrestrial in origin is debatable. What's undeniable is that joining the 1950s, people routinely spotted objects flying over the United States and many other countries. And it was the honest of the United States military to figure out what they were and whether they posed any danger in fact. Project Blue Book would earn its name because at that time Air Force officials equated studying the phenomenon with preparing for a college Blue Book exam. In 1965, Oklahoma Police, the Tinker Air Force Base, and a local meteorologists using weather radar independently tracked four unexplained flying objects. However later, Project Blue Book would claim that the witnesses had simply observed the planet Jupiter, which was absolutely crazy because Jupiter wasn't even visible in the night sky. I believe it was Robert Razor, an Oklahoma planetarium director said at the time, the air Force must have had a staff finder upside down during August, he's very interesting. I see it was a more Bagley botched scientific explanations eventually led to the congressional hearing, a congressional hearing that looked into Project Blue Book truth. - [Narrator] Blue Book's goal according to those who held it in low esteem was to attach some explanation to every case, regardless of logical common sense. The urgency with which Blue Book officials tagged dances on the cases without having done the proper investigation is obvious, they're not proven. But if the Air Force was so eager to label cases identified, despite the lack of supporting evidence then those few cases, which had been labeled unidentified, presumably withstood all attempts to apply every kind of investigation. What follows is a number of official investigations of those cases. September the 21st, 1950 Provincetown, Massachusetts 9:52 a.m, M.I.T research associate an Air National Guard Major M.H. Ligda reported that a radar tracking of one object took place. The United States Air Force flight of F-86 jet fighters attempted to intercept. The object traveled 22 miles traveling at 1200 miles per hour, and made a turn of 11 to 12 Gs acceleration during a one minute observation. - In 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency responded to these fears by assembling an expert panel of scientists headed by a physicist H.P. Robertson of the California Institute of Technology to discuss the big UFO issue. The Robertson panel met for three days, during which they interviewed military offices and Project Blue Book Officers and reviewed photos and film of supposed UFO's. To all the panel concluded that where there was no basis for the so-called extraterrestrial hypothesis and that UFO's posed no security threat. 90% of the sightings, according to the Robertson panel could be attributed to astronomical or meteorological activity, or even manmade causes such as balloons and searchlights. The panel's findings were not fully declassified until 1970. Now we always have to ask our question, why is that? Feeding suspicions that a government conspiracy was in fact at work. - [Narrator] October the 15th, 1950, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 3:20 p.m, Atomic Energy Commission trooper Rymer, J. Moneymaker, and Captain Zarzecki witnessed to shiny silver objects shaped like a bullet, both objects, suddenly dived, leaving smoke trails. A few seconds later one of the objects vanished. The other was seen to hover at five to 600 feet in altitude a minute or so later, the object left and returned several times, but somewhat further away. - I think initially projects like Project Blue Book were formed, I mean, there's been many different projects and not just by the United States, by countries all over the world, that I'd lot seriously into the UFO problem. And they've say problem, because they didn't know what was actually invading their skies, didn't even know if they even had control over their own skies. And the fact that seems even so much today that we do not have control of the skies. And that's probably one of the biggest problems to any government. Nobody wants to actually turn around to their general public and say, hey, you know, we don't know what they are, B, we don't know where they're coming from and C, we haven't got control over the phenomena. Bottom line is that these projects are put together to try and find out new things about the phenomena. To gain an advancement, to try and learn something new. I don't know if we're here really to still hold all the cards. It's ignorant to think that we have all the answers. I think we're far from holding all the answers. - [Narrator] December the sixth, 1950, Fort Myers, Florida, 5:00 p.m, former aircraft purchasing agent Harry Lamp, and four boys using low power binoculars saw an object approximately 75 feet long with a three to four foot thick bubble on top, the object was silver with a red rim having two white and two orange jets along it. The center was seen to revolve when it hovered the sighting lasted for several minutes before it flew off at high speed. January the 16th, 1951, Artesia, New Mexico, 3:40 p.m, two members of a balloon project from the General Mills Aeronautical Research Laboratory, and three pilots from Artesia Airport were monitoring a high altitude balloon at around 112,000 feet. When a dull white, round object was spotted, it appeared larger than the balloon, but made no movement. Later, the balloon crew and the others saw two objects from the airport, flying side by side, they circled the balloon and flew away to the Northeast. The second observation lasted about 40 seconds before the objects darted away. August the 25th, 1951 Albuquerque, New Mexico, 9:58 p.m. Sandia Base Security Guard Hung Young and his wife watched as a flying wing shaped craft, passed over their heads at an altitude of 800 to 1000 feet. The object made no sound and was one and a half times the wingspan of a B-36 bomber. There were dark, chordwise stripes on its underside and six to eight pairs of soft, glowing lights on its trailing edge of the wing. It speed was estimated to be 300 to 400 miles per hour. And it was seen for about 30 seconds. - Over the next 17 years Project Blue Book will compile reports of 12,618 UFO sighting, all related events. Similarly to the Robertson panel, Blue Book would venture classify more than 90% of these is identified, meaning they were caused by known astronomical or atmospheric or artificial manmade phenomena, the remaining 701 incidents we've referred to as unidentified, this included cases of which you could say were insufficient information assigned that they couldn't give it a known cause. Clearly Project Blue Book was not going to give her pigs secrets time soon, the remaining seminars in one cases were far more intriguing than we would like to believe. Some of which are featured in new and upcoming documentary produced by James Fox entitled Seminar one, the Unknowns. - [Narrator] August the 31st, 1951, Matador, Texas 12:45 p.m, Mrs. Tilson, and one or two other women all apparently have excellent reputations saw a pear-shaped object in the sky with a length of a B-29 fuselage around a hundred feet. It's color was Aluminum or silver with a port or some type of aperture on the side. It moved with its smaller end forward, drifting slowly at about 150 feet in altitude. Then headed up in a circular fashion and out of sight after a few seconds. - What is interesting to know is, is that when Steven Spielberg made his hit movie Close Encounters of the Third Cane, he introduced numerous different real cases, I mean, sometimes Blue Book cases, information into the movie because he wanted to represent, he wanted that movie to represent the true phenomena and he did damn well, he really did well, even put aspects of paranormal in, you remember those scenes from the movie with the whole kitchen explodes into life and things are moving around, taps are turning on, lights are flashing, fridges are jumping around. That was a representation of a real case, believe it or not people who have had UFO encounters sometimes prior, sometimes after their experience had Poltergeist type disturbances. These were listed within the Project Blue Book, Project Blue Book guys went out there on occasion and talk information how to look good. What was also interesting is that Blue Book conferences used to invite the media along. So it looked like the media were already there filming the officers attending, or we're doing our job. We're very interested in UFO's wink, wink. And at the end of the day, the real information, they weren't even being careful about it. People who were in paranormal cases associated in the UFO experiences, did you wanna touch it? No. In fact, Project Blue Book conferences came forward and said, oh, we don't want all that ghost stuff. We don't want all that, that's a bit strange, but we're quite happy with the UFO's and aliens thing, you know, and that's a shame because I think that we threw away an opportunity that to try and understand what this phenomenon really truly represents. And yes, on many occasions, this phenomenon, the UFO phenomenon does represent itself in the paranormal, the metaphysical, the supernatural, the spiritual aspects. It's a whole conundrum of things which are taking place in many occasions. And I think sometimes we ignore aspects of that. It'll just means that we're not getting a clear picture, Blue Book did that for us, they only presented the UFO side of the story and nothing else, nothing unusual was ever reported onto those documents in the Blue Book Office. Those things really do need relooking at, and the phenomenon really does need looking at in the sense where it's not contained within a box. All the other boxes, divided boxes, being the supernatural, spiritual, the paranormal, the metaphysical, we need to tear them down guys. We need to get out of proper understanding what the UFO represents, we need to tear them all down. - [Narrator] October the 11th, 1951, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 6:30 a.m, General Mills balloon researchers, including aeronautical engineer, J.J. Kaliszweski aerologist, C.B Moore, pilot Dick Reiley, who was at the time in the air and Doug Smith on the ground saw the first object, a brightly glowing one with a dark underside and a halo around it. The object arrived high and fast then slowed and made climbing circles for about two minutes and finally sped away to the east. Soon they saw another one confirmed by ground observers, which sped across the sky. The first object was seen for a total time of five minutes. The second was just a few seconds. March the 29th, 1952, 20 miles North of Misawa Air Force Base Japan 11:20 a.m. Mr. G. Brigham, a pilot of AT-6 trainer saw a very thin, shiny metallic disc, which flew alongside the AT-6, then made a pass at an F-84 jet fighter flipped on edge, fluttered 20 feet from the F-84 fuselage and flipped again in the slipstream. All in around 10 seconds. April 27th, 1952 Roseville, Michigan 4:15 p.m, H.A. Freytag and three male relatives, including a minister saw a silver oval craft, it rolled and descended then stopped. Then suddenly it split into three silver cigar-shaped objects, one departing to the east and one to the west. A third silver cigar-shaped object flew by at a high speed. All sightings lasted around 45 minutes. - In 1966, the Air Force had requested the formation of another committee to look into the details of 59 UFO sightings investigated by Project Blue Book, the committee headed by Dr. Edward Condon and based at the university in Colorado released its scientific study of unidentified flying objects better known as the Condon report in 1968, called into the Condon report, the sightings they examined showed no evidence of any unusual activity and recommended that the Air Force stop investigating into UFO related incidents. In 1969 in response to the Condon report as well, as a decline in number of UFO sightings, Project Blue Book was officially brought to an end. - [Narrator] May the first 1952, George Air Force Base, California, 10:50 a.m Colonel Williams and two friends on the arms range, plus Lieutenant Colonel Hansen, four miles away. So five flat-white disks about the diameter of a C-47's wingspan, about 90 feet. They flew fast and made a 90 degree turn in a formation three in front and two behind. They were seen to dart around for 15 to 30 seconds before heading off to the east. May the 29th, 1952, San Antonio, Texas 7:22 p.m. United States Air Force pilot, Major D.W. Feuerstein whilst on the ground, saw a bright tubular object tilt from horizontal to vertical for eight minutes. Then it slowly returned to a horizontal position, and again, tilted vertically before accelerating upwards, the object appeared to lengthen and turned red as it climbed. The entire siting lasted for 14 minutes, June the 5th, 1952 Offut Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska 11:05 p.m. Second Lieutenant W.R. Soper, a Strategic Air Command top secret control officer and former OSI agent. Along with two other persons saw a bright red object. It remained stationary for four to five minutes before speeding away with a short tail towards the south. June the 13th, 1952, Middletown Pennsylvania, 8:45 p.m. Mr. R.S. Thomas, an Olmsted Air Force Base employee and former control tower operator watched around orange object traveling south. It suddenly stopped for around one to two seconds, abruptly turned east stopped again for one to two seconds and descended out of view around three miles away. June the 17th, 1952, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 1:28 a.m, a pilot of United States Air Force F-94 jet interceptor saw what he could only describe as like a bright star across the nose of the airplane. He watched the light for around 15 seconds. Radar operators confirmed no other traffic in the area at the time. June the 21st, 1952 Kelly Air Force Base, Texas 12:30 p.m. Sergeant Howard Davis, a flight engineer of a B-29 bomber at 8,000 feet in altitude saw a flat object with a sharply pointed front and rounded rear. It was white with a dark blue center and had a red rim. The object also trailed sparks as it dived past the B-29 at a distance of 500 feet in just one second. The object quickly disappeared from view. June the 26th, 1952, Pottstown, Pennsylvania, 11:50 p.m. Mr K. Fuller, the Assistant Manager of a civilian airport reported seeing three sightings of flashing lights. Two lights separated by two miles with the leader flashing steadily and the other irregularly, two similarly flashing lights, but with one mile of separation, finally, one of the lights sped off to the Southeast and the other traveled north at an estimated 150 to 250 miles per hour. The sighting lasted around 30 minutes. July the fourth, 1947 over Emmett Idaho, 8:17 p.m, PDT. United Air Lines captain E.J. Smith. First Officer Ralph Stephens, Stewardess Marty Morrow watched for 12 to 15 minutes while four objects with flat bottoms and rough tops moved at varying speeds, with one high and to the right of the others. Local radar towers did not report anything out of the usual. Note, this incident was reported on the very same day as the Roswell UFO incident in New Mexico. - Individual researchers and UFO organizations believe that members of the Project Blue Book were pressured into identifying UFO sightings and to curb public history about UFO's. This theory has been supported by the release of CIA documents pertaining to UFO's. They also suggest that any report that was initially perceived as unexplainable or would cause public concern was never included in Project Blue Book, they allege that these reports were passed on to higher authorities that never reported the results to the public. Project Blue Book, it seems was just a low level collection and disinformation program created on the Project Sign, which took place in December of 1947, which of course involved Project Grudge of December, 1948, to cover up to investigation into what these UFO's really represented. - [Narrator] The amount of detail in these Blue Book cases vary enormously. Some of the cases, usually those which were well publicized by the media at the time, contain much more information while the others are vague and seriously incomplete. Project Blue Book officers placed the blame for such incompleteness on the witness. However, Blue Book should not share that responsibility, ask yourself why in thousands of cases, there are no completed questionnaires or report forms in the project files nor even any indication that such a form was sent out to a witness. And in most of the instances where a questionnaire was filled out, for some reason, it was never followed up. For much of the life of Project Blue Book and its predecessors, there were no satisfactory completed questionnaires at all. Quite simply blue book was just a front to show the pressing American public that such things are nothing more than flocks of birds, mishy clouds. and of course, swamp gas. [upbeat music] - If we went back in time to the 1940s, and I said to people in 50 or 60 years time, we'll be walking around with small, powerful computers used to communicate with each other around the world. That we'd have access to the worldwide web, where we can almost get any information instantaneously that would achieve magnetic levitation and quantum locking, radar and visual invisibility. You'd likely think I've gone completely mad or I'm talking about something at a comic Sci fi story. Take the best of minds in the world, as an example, ask them if they can replicate, duplicate, back engineer UFO piece by piece, how long would they need to complete the task? 5 years, 10 years, 50 years. It's now been 73 years since the alleged crash of a UFO Roswell, and there's even some evidence to support that engineering programs may have even been going on longer than Roswell in secret bunkers throughout Germany. When you sit back and really think about this, I think there's a good chance that some of these strange crafts could be ours. As you may know, the last few years, I've been a bulls with the talk of secret UFO programs and the U.S Pentagon releasing UFO footage taken by Naval Military Pilots, you'll probably remember them. The three films were said to have captured unidentified crafts and were given the names as Tic-Tac, Gofast and Gimbal. Despite several official statements, the U.S government have never lost sight nor their interest in this phenomenon. - [Narrator] For over 10 years now, the office of Naval Intelligence has been covertly investigating encounters between military pilots and unidentified aerial vehicles. It also shows that despite repeated denials, these events are still of great concern to the U.S military because of the possible threat they represent. The Pentagon was once responsible for this, but according to them, a program to examine a phenomenon was closed down, but nevertheless, it still remains and has simply been renamed and tucked away out of sight inside the office of Naval intelligence. - Researchers first got wind of such government programs was back in the day when Robert Bigelow and his newly created mid scientific team was secretly investigating the phenomenon surrounding Skinwalker ranch in Utah. As you can see in the video filmed in January, 2019 in Utah, it was filmed by Sam Chortek and Jimmy Chappie. A strange craft was seen to appear near the distant mountains, descends and quickly turns traveling around three and a half miles in just one second. Now that's a lot that's very fast. That's an incredible 12,600 miles per hour, captured at high definition on a camera fitter to a drone whilst in flight, the object was neither seen nor heard at any time. It's an impressive piece of footage I have to say, but to travel at 12,600 miles per hour, if we actually got anything that can do that. - [Narrator] Robert Bigelow's program was known as the advanced aerospace weapons system application program and was said to have become the advanced aerospace threat identification program. But now there seems to be an even newer program in operation. Pentagon officials refuse to discuss this program, which bizarrely, although they claim it is not classified. It deals with classified matters. And it recently appeared in a Senate committee report outlining spending on the nation's intelligence agencies for the coming year. Although this makes it appear legitimate and aboveboard, much of this funding disappears into black budget projects. So what it is used for and where it eventually ends up is anyone's guess. - Opinions from researchers are seemingly divided when it comes to strange high-speed crafts, like the Tic-Tac UFO, for example. So I believe that because this craft was set of descended from 80,000, feet around about 80 feet in just seconds, that is far beyond any human technology. But is that an accurate statement? Some researchers, myself included believe we cannot rule out the possibility of advanced human engineering. Say for example, the Tic Tacs or unusual appendages allegedly seen and described by the military pilots, they looked remarkably similar to pitot tubes found on earthly airborne vehicles used to measure airflow and sends data to oddball computers, which when then coupled with GPS data allows that craft to self guide or just to a given room. Even things like this, that talk of Naval paintings of hybrid airspace on the watercraft, capable of flying in space in our skies, and of course on the water, at great speeds without feeling any inertia whatsoever. Again, opinions on research is divided. - [Narrator] According to a recent news item that appeared in the New York Times an official report named another program as the unidentified aerial phenomenon taskforce, which is intended to standardize collection and reporting on sightings of unexplained aerial vehicles and to release at least some of the findings to the public within 180 days of the intelligence authorization act being signed into law. While officials were involved, hope the program will provide evidence of vehicles from other worlds. It is mainly focused on establishing whether other nations, especially potential adversaries are using unsuspected aircraft or specialized technology that could threaten the United States. The acting chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence, Senator Marco Rubio said that he was interested in any unidentified aircraft seen over American military basis. He also said it was vital to discover what they were and who they belong to. He was concerned that some potential hostile foreign power may have developed an advanced technology that allowed them to do this, and the United States was unable to stop them. Mr. Rubio said, some of these unidentified aircraft were using technology unfamiliar to the U.S military, but he added that the explanation for this could still be a normal one, but they're yet to find out. - There is the possibility that military pilots might've been engaging our own secret advanced technology and that they weren't aware of this at the time. United States, Navy FA-18 super Hornet pilots encountered unidentified flying objects at 30,000 feet while conducting training missions off the east coast of the United States in 2014 and 2015. It was the first time the most advanced sensor fusion networking and computer processing capabilities were United available across an operational carrier strike group. One ship already had a track record of encounters. Now a bit of USS Nimitz, including the Tic-Tac UFO off the Barger coast, Northwest of Mexico in 2004. - [Narrator] The Nimitz class aircraft carrier, USS Theodore Roosevelt had just returned from a significant four year overhaul in 2013, which included systems associated with the latest operational iteration of the Navy's cooperative engagement capability. When the Nimitz carrier strike group encountered the Tic-Tac UFO in 2004, it was in the midst of the first ever CSG level operations of the initial iteration of the CEC. This uses the strike groups, diverse and powerful surveillance sensors, including the spy one radar on Aegis combat system, equipped cruisers and destroyers, as well as the E-2 Hawkeye's radar picture from high altitude and fuses that information into a common picture via data links and advanced computer processing. This intern provides very high fidelity tracks of targets, thanks to telemetry from various sensors, operating a different bands, and looking at the same target from different aspects and different ranges. Instead of the objects such as stealth fighters, disappearing and reappearing, a normal radar systems with the CEC that target will remain steady in both platforms at the CEC enabled screens, as they are seeing fuse data from both sources and likely many others as well. The data link connectivity and the quality of the enhanced telemetry means that weapons platforms such as ships and aircraft could also fire on targets without needing to use their own sensor data. For instance, a cruiser could fire a missile at a low flying UFO that is being tracked by a Hawkeye and an F-18 even though it doesn't show up on their own scopes. In 2004, the incident of the Baja coast was the most opportune time to capture the very best real world sensor data on a high-performance target in near lab by controlled settings offered by that restricted airspace, the theater Roosevelt carrier strike groups encounters with UFO's only began towards the end of 2014. According to the Times Newspaper, in closing it's hard to overstress just how opportune the conditions would have been for this particular CSG, or elements of it equipped with the world's best air defense capabilities to be tested against exotic and high-performance flying craft. It is also curious that sightings of these objects would coincide with the first major deployment of the cooperative engagement capability or Naval integrated fire control counter air architecture, and the E2D Hawkeye, and then more would occur around the time of the strike groups workup to the first operational deployment of those systems. This information may indicate that the U.S Naval strike group specialized radar, tracking systems and equipment was being tested as part of an operation using advanced aerial vehicles currently owned and secretly phoned by fractions of American government. As we know, in 2017, an article appeared in the New York Times that revealed the existence of a unit called the advanced aerospace threat identification program. However, officials from the defense department said it no longer existed and had been disabled since 2012. However, people who were working on the program denied this and said it was still an existence. Something that was later confirmed by the defense department. The program began in 2007 and was originally run by the Defense Intelligence Agency, but was eventually placed under the jurisdiction of the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, which still remains responsible for it. The office of Naval Intelligence will coordinate its operations within the intelligence community as described in the Senate budget bill. So it seems that despite denials, the program was never shut down. Although a little is said about it after 2017, Luis Elizondo, a Career Military Intelligence official, allegedly in charge of the Pentagon's Aerospace threat identification program, who resigned in October, 2017, confirmed that the new task force evolved as a part of an advanced aerospace program. Mr. Elizondo claimed to have been in charge of a previous Pentagon program monitoring unidentified aerial vehicles. He said that in his opinion, it was no longer necessary to deny their existence because the public had a right to know. Elizondo is among the small group of former government officials and scientists who are certain that objects of unknown origin have crashed here on earth and parts have been taken from them and analyzed. For more than a decade, interviews were conducted with those involved in the program. And it became clear that the Pentagon was keeping various interest groups, both government and civilian informed at highly classified briefings. According to some of the scientists, in some instances, earthly explanations were found regarding previously unexplained incidents, but even a lack of a plausible terrestrial explanation does not necessarily make an extraterrestrial one, the most likely. Harry Reid, a former Democratic Senator from Nebraska who helped to obtain the funding for earlier UFO programs said he believed that crashes of unidentified objects had occurred and that any materials taken from these objects should be studied. He said that after examining the evidence, he had come to the conclusion that both government and companies in the public sector had material taken from crashed objects. However, none of these artifacts found at the crash sites have ever been offered for independent analysis, but based on government laboratory studies, some retrieved objects, mainly metallic fragments were later identified as originating from here on earth. This conclusion is debatable because if the results came from government labs, then there is every chance that any findings that were not acceptable were deliberately concealed. One astrophysicist, Eric W. Davis PhD, who worked from 2007 as a subcontractor and consultant for the Pentagon UFO program said that examination of some of the materials had failed to determine their source. He said, quite categorically, that he did not know where it came from, but it was certainly not made here on earth. - The analysis carried out on some of these metamaterials concluded a 4% isotopic differential. That means though there are manufactured from materials found here on earth, like dark bismuth, silver magnesium, and zinc alloys, they don't have the same earthly traits. A 4% isotopic differential means it's not terrestrial in origin, it doesn't come from here. The analysis carried out by the late Roger Leir found the very same things in his reports. Some of these small implants also had a 4% isotopic differential. So what does this mean? Are these two materials possibly on the same source, are bits of metal from alleged UFO's the same material as some of these implants? Is fascinating. Maybe that's how the pilots of UFO's have the capabilities of locating abductees. A direct source matched between the craft and the implant. - [Narrator] Dr. Eric Davis also made the point, the public should be made aware of these developments to help clarify what we know about these strange craft. The same astrophysicist who now works for aerospace corporation, a defense contractor said to give a recent classified briefing to the defense department about material taken from these unidentified crashed vehicles. He was also very clear that despite all the denials, this program was never shut down. Committee staff members were approached, but didn't respond to requests for their opinions on the matter. - If there is as many experts at crash retrieval operations to nonexistence, then it's not hard to imagine that such operations exist throughout the 1940s and the fifties and the sixties and so on. Two of my friends and fellow researchers, Grant Cameron and Richard Dolan will gladly agree that such a finding would explain many reports of incidents and shed some light on some of the official documents take for an example, the Admiral Wilson leak papers. - [Narrator] Because of the dubious nature of the information from the briefings, it's difficult to discuss classified programs. And this has forced many of the officials who have studied UFO's to make their views known without any hard evidence. The public continues to be fascinated by the subject of UFO's so much so that U.S president Donald Trump has now become involved. He allegedly told one of his sons, Donald Trump, Jr. That he had learned a lot about what really happened at Roswell. This is fascinating because whatever occurred there many decades ago still lies at the very heart of the UFO enigma. Donald Trump was specifically asked if he would ever declassify information about what did or didn't happen at Roswell, because much of the information surrounding this event has still not been made public. He said that he would have to think about it. Evidently he is still thinking about it because like his predecessors in the White House, no president has ever said anything worthwhile about the phenomenon of UFO. - I'm sure we'll end up being provided more footage in time. I don't believe such things are released accidentally from official government establishment. In fact, it could all be a plan to softly release UFO information and type of disclosure. But to show some of them will most certainly be our own. Recently, my friend Emmanuel Whoosa from Mexico released some interesting footage on social media. What you're looking at here is a piece of mobile phone footage taken by Amber White in Wichita, Kansas. At first you can see some high altitude aircraft, but what then comes into view is what looks to be an object similar to that described as the Tic-Tac UFO. Further information is being distributed by Emanural and to find out more, I popped a link in the channel in the comments. So for now, we've still left with a mystery, are some of the Australia's cross hours being test flown out there in a location away from prime guys, in areas where civilian boats and ships might not actually be, due to Naval operations in places where commercial jets might not even be flying over. If that's the case, then the days are concluding that these craft, extraterrestrial acknowledging may truly be gone. [upbeat music] It would seem that this phenomenon may have always been here. In fact, it's likely that the phenomenon pre-dates historical ambivalent documentation. So rather than asking, how long has this phenomenon been taking place, maybe we should ask, how long have we been around to witness it? Maybe we're the new kids on the block. - [Narrator] Although a large proportion of the population accept this fact, the subject is regarded by society norms as illusory and outlandish, a fantasy or form of mythology. How this situation came about is unclear. However, at some point it appears a positive decision was made by the ruling classes of the world to suppress this fact. It's not possible to prevent the population perceiving the presence of this phenomenon. So the strategy was to stifle only the most decisive physical evidence and deal with the rest by manipulating social conventions through media propaganda. So that UFO's would be regarded by most people with the aforementioned ridicule, when this strategy began is also not known, but one possibility has been suggested by that great XO politician, Steven Bassetts, he's pinpointed the very date that this strategy dawned, what he calls the Truth Embargo. On the 8th of July, 1947, a new story was published around the world stating that a flying disc had been captured in New Mexico USA near the town of Roswell as the world's media descended on the small American backwater. A second report was published stating that there had been an embarrassing mistake and that the flying disc was nothing more than a weather balloon. During that day, the government had chosen to classify the proof that we are not alone. Many researchers believe there is good reason to suspect that the Truth Embargo is really much older than what was initially thought. There are credible reports of Roswell like events, many years before 1947. What's more when the Roswell incident took place, the U.S government appeared to know exactly what to do when it carried out the crash retrievers. - There's plenty of evidence to suggest that the UFO's is not a new phenomenon. We can see things right from thousands upon thousands of years ago, such as Patrick lifts and drawings our ancient ancestors left behind. There is an interesting story about Alexander the great as well as he was warring, and he was trying to besiege the city and should we've used walls. I was finding it very difficult until one day flying disks descended from the sky, scaring is war relevance, but they did manage to fire a beam of light down at this wall and causing it to disintegrate allowing Alex under to actually gain access to the city and besiege it, fascinating stories like this in scriptures, always, always find it very interesting, Columbus as well, great discoverer, when he allegedly found America, you obviously wasn't the first one guy, but Columbus, when he was noting in his diary said that he saw strange lights coming from the ocean. In fact, they followed them for some time, only to maybe an hour or so later actually came across America. It's interesting to know that this information isn't just with these incidents, there are thousands of types of these things recorded throughout history, along with drawings and images and petroglyphs all over the world. It would seem this phenomenon has been around for quite some time. - [Narrator] As if they had already developed protocols and methods, as well as personnel who were trained and experienced in this highly unusual duty. We can also anticipate that the motive for pre-Roswell crash retrievals because of how several scientists were mistreated in the late 19th and early 20th century, such as Nikola Tesla. The name of the city of Roswell New Mexico USA will eventually be entered into a dictionary as a common noun for when an artifact from an extraterrestrial civilization comes to grief on the earth surface and is secretly salvaged by the authorities who then put out a cover story and deny that anything has happened at all. There are many examples from all over the world, the Welsh Roswell, the Russian Roswell, the Brazilian Roswell, and so on. Wherever on earth, Roswell's transpire, the same thing happens, which indicates that there's a global policy in place that all sovereign states are bay. Several questions have emerged about this scenario, including why would the governments keep allien secret from us. One could answer that they are concerned about the effect, the acknowledgement that we're not alone would have on society. Governments are very keen on psychological tactics and employ specialist agencies to assess every new invention and discovery for its political impact due to changes it causes in the culture and collective mental state of the citizens. - Newcomers to the subjects of euphology might not quite grasp the importance of the Roswell incident. For those researchers who have spent many years studying this case, they will quickly identify the huge efforts by the United States government to scramble together suitable and rational explanations, anything from weather blooms to top secret projects, even crash dummies being misidentified as alien bodies have surfaced as explanations. There are a few inconsistencies with the Roswell case. Was it just a single object that crushed due to a severe storm one night in question, or was it two objects that collided together? There are even theories suggesting that the objects or objects were purposely brought down, utilizing some specialized type of equipment, such as high energy radar or electric magnetic pulses. Whatever actually occurred, one thing stands out that the craft of unknown origin did in fact crash and small bodies were in fact recovered at the scene. - [Narrator] In 1959 at the Dawn of the space program. One such agency, the Brookings Institution released a report entitled, Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities with Human Affairs, the Implications of Discovery of Extraterrestrial life. It concludes that such a bombshell might have a disruptive effect on society and that should it be found, it might not be a good idea to shout it from the rooftops. The wording of the document gives the impression that it has the people's welfare at heart, but reading between the lines, there is no doubt that the vested interest under discussion was the government itself. They were afraid that the general public might become harder to govern. Some researchers believe lobbyists, Steve Bassett downplays this element of the Truth Embargo incorrectly. So it has to be asked, what is the U.S government doing with all this recovered physical evidence? Why have no covert state organizations learned by studying those shipwrecks from the sky? Not only that the exist, obviously, but also perhaps how they work, their power plants and propulsion systems. This technology would have to be very much in advance of what we have currently developed on earth. - There were a number of classified programs put in place by the United States government. Project Blue Fly was one of them and Gemini, Project Moon Dust. These were allegedly involved with forceful, bringing down a foreign objects, another to retrieve the objects and another to conduct analysis on them at Wright Patterson, Air Force Base, all the which are set to have taken place in the early 1960s. And let's not forget Wright Patterson Air Force Base was also associated with Project Blue Book. - No doubt, the military industrial complex will consider how to use such technology to their advantage. Intelligence agencies will strive to keep this knowledge secret from other countries that may infiltrate with spies in order to gain it. According to Bassett, the Truth Embargo is inextricably entwined with the geopolitics of the Cold War. An era now receding into history. This makes it obsolete and today the climate is ripe to come clean. There are researchers that believe that the Truth Embargo should be stopped and the U.S government need to be honest. How this can be done is very simple. The head of government calls a press conference and announces that a non-human extraterrestrial intelligence is engaging the human race. It takes less than a minute to say. However, many have wondered if it's really that straightforward. For those who watch the disclosure press conference, it's likely that they had hundreds of questions running through their minds. The most important one concerns, the classified scientific breakthroughs that might have been achieved from studying extraterrestrial debris. It could mean that we humans will henceforth beyond a level with an extra trash real species. We will have the same machines that generate free energy and remove the effects of the Earth's gravitational field. At the moment, human civilization is leaping forward in many aspects of technology, but we are overextending our reach when it comes to energy. We're still using the same basic energy sources that we have since the start of the industrial revolution, 200 years ago. This comes from burning fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas. The energy released cost money. Every user of domestic electricity receives a regular bill that draws a considerable amount from their income. Transport is also accompanied by considerable cost. The result is that much of the world's population simply cannot afford it, the result is poverty. Burning fossil fuels causes environmental damage from pollution and the destruction of the natural world, to the point where it's threatening the very survival of life on earth. When new bubbles like wind and solar energy have too many drawbacks to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. The declassification of free energy would solve most of the world's social, economic and environmental problems overnight set free from the burden of fossil fuels we would be able to generate as much energy as we needed for virtually no money, completely safe and clean. We would be able to build transports that have similar capabilities to UFO's. We would enter a Promethean golden age beyond anything we've experienced or even imagined before. It actually takes a lot of effort to comprehend how huge the difference would be between our present world and the post disclosure world. So why don't we live in that world? - Well, all of those research has that believe we are already in a form of disclosure. The subjects of UFOs and aliens is everywhere. In fact, it's within the national curriculum in the U.K schools and numerous other countries that school children learn about UFO's, aliens and even the hazards they can produce. If that isn't a form of drip feeding, then I don't know what is, it's got to be some form of disclosure. - [Narrator] Disclosure would devastate the oil industry an industry so huge that effectively is industry. It is the lifeblood and the lubricant of civilization as we know it, the owners and executives of oil companies would have to find other jobs. They include some very powerful and influential people indeed, who won't accept redundancy with Goodwill. Appealing to their concern for environmental well-being, human benefits and clean air would probably not win them over. Free energy would turn the world economy on its head, like nothing else imaginable. The entire global political order would have to be reorganized. Some of the most powerful countries will become less important. This concept is not a new one, and in fact, predates the modern UFO era, the way the aforementioned Nikola Tesla allegedly had his business destroyed indicates that the elite were fearful of the emergence of free energy for the reasons described many decades before Roswell. - I don't think it's common that UFO's are falsely brought down to the ground beat by any military aspects around the world, if he does happen and it could have been energy beams or powerful radar that just was coincidentally all at a time and had some effects on some of these objects. And they were forced to bring, come down and land on the ground or even crashing in fact. It would seem though that UFO's high pervasive and they're very good at doing so, I've done for many years. In fact, when we talk about the down orders that pilots have been given in the past on unidentified objects, they found it very difficult to do so because every time they were going to the objects would do this crazy maneuver certainly evasive, and these happened and happened and happened and kept going on, pallets, kept reporting that they, these objects were doing evasive maneuvers just prior to them being able to lock onto them. It was seeing there was a connection between the UFO's and the pilots of these military aircraft, some conscious connection. It would seem whoever was in these UFO's were managing to read the pallets in tense. This lens, hand to the fact is that bringing down objects like UFO's are not very common as you can well imagine, but there may have been a number of incidents that do happen. At the end of the day accidents do happen. Look at Roswell for an example, was it a storm that brought it down? Was it a collision who knows, but it's not the first time and it might happen again. So you have to understand that the government, the U.S government and many other governments around the world might have to prepare humanity just in case another object comes down, because if it does, it certainly won't be allowed to Roswell days because people nowadays don't have the respect that they did back then for the U.S government or military personnel. And secondly, everything that you might see and experience, we'll bring up on the internet within the first five minutes on channels like this. So of course, you know, maybe we are being prepped under control because nowadays and I have seen this, nowadays, when people have it in UFO experience or sighting, they tell the friends, attend their family. You might message or put something on the internet, a week later it's lost, it means nothing. Maybe there's reasons behind that, may be we are being controlled. The format of reporting UFO's doesn't seem to come across our desk very often, maybe that is somehow being conditioned. We have to ask the questions, if that's the case, then why. Bring it down UFO's has change objects, I don't think that's going to happen very often. - [Narrator] Also, what about the implications of alien abduction? It wouldn't be easy for any government to admit that their Air base is regularly invaded, and people are taken against their will, and there's nothing anybody can do about it. Along with the controversy surrounding the effects of disclosure, the elite will have to cope with the controversy of the coverup itself. For almost a century, the authorities have sat on technology that could improve the world in almost every way to an almost unimaginable degree. They could have told people of the world at the time, but they didn't. What spin doctor could possibly dig them out of that hole. The cynicism in the relationship between the masses and the elite would soul to a pinnacle we've never seen before. The political structures of our nations simply do not have the capacity to absorb a revelation of that magnitude. The Truth Embargo is not just a cold war strategy. It's a truth to suppression is quintessential to the very existence of the current political order. All of these points will be well understood by the keepers of UFO secrecy. - There are rumors that in 1964, the U.S government did in fact consider telling the people of the world that we are not alone. They supposedly came in the form of some type of official roadshow, showing the evidence that had been gathered, including photographs and various entities that were involved. However, it comes at no surprise that the whole project was suddenly pulled at the last minute. - [Narrator] There may be many factors involved in the Truth Embargo that researchers are not aware of, indeed, that even dedicated XO politicians are not aware of. The obvious example is the extraterrestrials themselves. It's impossible to predict their future actions in the same way that it's impossible to fully comprehend their current ones. They could expose themselves easily by landing on the proverbial White House, lower or something similar. It's easy to anthropomorphize them and get angry that they're collaborating with the Truth Embargo. But if we do so, we're putting ourselves in their place, is better not to pass judgment. Therefore we should remain open and cautiously hopeful to the possibility of disclosure. It may well still come, but it could come in a manner nobody yet knows or recognizes fully. Take for example, the theory that disclosure with a small D is already taking place. Since the 1940s, there seems to have been a constant drip feed of information. The concept of UFO's Flying saucers and alien beings from distant planets have been permanently burned into our minds, TV shows, movies, cartoons, comics, food, and drink names, toys, and games, and even a clothing line features UFO's. The subject is kept at the forefront of our minds, children of numerous countries are now educated in the subject of UFO's. And it's featured in the U.K national curriculum. Over a hundred schools have taken part in an educational program that involved manufacturing, a crashed UFO seen often using real police officers and real crime scene investigators to help teach the younger generation of biological and chemical hazards in association with UFO's. When questions were raised about this form of education, it was explained that the program was developed to help nurture creative writing skills. Back in 1947, when the Roswell incident took place, most people respected the U.S Military and Government when asked not to disclose information about what they had seen or experienced, they obeyed without question. In today's society, should a UFO come crashing down in a town, there, no way any amount of military or government employees would be able to keep a lid on it. Photographs and video footage would be uploaded to the worldwide web within minutes and many have a lesser respect for military officers turning up on the scene and instructing folk not to talk about what they've seen. - When it eventually comes. And I believe it will, discloser of such information could destabilize economy not to mention religion. I think it's really important that we first know how to deal with these issues before any whisper of disclosure. - [Narrator] Certainly times have changed and this of course must be a worry for the government of the world. Their best way to approach this problem is to make the subject well-known and keeping their minds as regularly as possible. Witnesses to UFO's often find themselves posting their sightings and experiences on the internet today, rather than reporting them to organizations. - People often ask about what do we know about Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Well, you know, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base seen to be the central location associated with lots of the UFO projects and programs that has been going on. However, if we take for an example, Project Blue Book, which really was fruitless effort, to be honest with you, I mean, it didn't really provide us anything. And I think the whole reason for Project Blue Book was that the U.S government were just trying to satisfy general public concerns at the time. What's all these planes sources about and demanded answers. And I think the responses that they got were not truthful. The conclusions weren't met properly, there wasn't really any scientific studies carried out. I think Project Blue Book was a little bit of a disguise as to making it look to be something credible when in fact it wasn't, believe it was only a very small room, maybe 6 foot by 10, couple of phones and a desk, and the thing on the wall. Not much for a big operation, which was so important on the study of something, which is probably clusters the greatest discovering humanity. And as you can, well, imagine lots of people realize now, especially researchers that Blue Book was nothing like it was supposed to have been. And of course, right in the sense of that was Wright Patterson Air Force Base. And it's also set that Wright Patterson Air Force Base has been involved with captured aliens, pieces of debris from craft and crushed sources and even specialized technology, seems to always been at the sense of the location of all strange things. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was a very special location. - [Narrator] The closure of the UK Ministry of Defense UFO reporting desk has made it even harder to officially report such incidents. More recently, there has been an official recognition of a Pentagon program known as the advanced aerospace threat identification program, AATIP and the release of several official UFO videos taken by military personnel, demonstrating that disclosure with a small D is very much still active. - There have been a number of fascinating developments recently. Some would suggest that the U.S government are slowly releasing information as part of disclosure, rather than the big announcement, you know, such as our fellow Americans aliens are with us. Maybe we are to be given these strategic stages of drip feeding. So we have time to digest and prepare for such huge implications. It's going to happen, it's just a matter of when. - [Narrator] Reported UFO incidents. So it become short-lived as a subject floods the internet market. The I've seen and heard it all before principle has certainly become beneficial to governments. Rarely does active investigation take place anymore, especially when we're immersed with so much data simply by sitting in front of our computers and scanning the internet, which has become a great resource tool, the truths and disinformation. Ben Emlyn-Jones is the author of Roswell Rising, Roswell Revealed and Roswell Redeemed, a trilogy of novels, exploring the possibility and effects of a UFO disclosure in fictional form. [upbeat music]
