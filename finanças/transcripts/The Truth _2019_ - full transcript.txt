I have already answered that question. Read my interview in Libération. Next question... What else is there? When you get to heaven what would... - That God would tell me? - Yup. Exact. So why me do now? What was his favorite role? Hélène, in another day. To which she won her second César. The widow that hides the German soldier. For me, it is his best role. The unforgettable expression of his face... ...when the throw stones. Unfazed and... ...risoluta. When I read the script, I thought I would have sold my soul to the devil to interpret it. The soul, not the body. - No Edith Rosay. - I know. This did not write it. Why? Le Figaro interviewed her last month. Really? I was sure I was at his funeral. The indistinguishable... Oh yes! She thought she was alive! Do not you think you look like at that actor... Yup. That actor English, Sir something ... It was in Murder on the Orient Express. - Will Sir John Gielgud. - Yup! But less distinct. But caring. Even too much. Which actress has sent more of his DNA. I do not have ever asked. I have always been myself. And on the contrary... Which actress has sent a bit 'of his DNA. In France, I think at no. - Then? - I do not remember. - And you, Dad? - No, I've never been there. I was on the set when you're coming. The house seems... -...a castle. - Exactly. Yes, even if behind there is a prison. A turtle! A turtle! - Dad, look! - Oh. His name is Pierre. - Hello, Pierre. - It's a grandpa. Hey, I did not see you scared? Here it is. What eats? - Lettuce. - Lettuce? Eat lettuce. He guests. I'm going away. Nothing important. She's my daughter with her little family. They came to congratulate him for the book. He lives in the United States. He's the screenwriter. She married an actor? "Actor" is a big word. However... So, you tell me about the movie that is filming now, my mother's memories. It will not be a great film. Charlotte, but as you grow up! - Do you remember me? - No. - I'm not surprised. - Do you like Italian food? - Yup. And what? - Pizza! - I'll make. Come, settle. Come, come Charlotte. We'll play later. - Never mind the dog. - See you later. This... - Sorry for the mess. - No problem. He had a housekeeper ... she left last month. - Too bad, she was a good woman. - Why did she leave? Maybe because she's a good woman. Hey, Charlotte. - I'll sleep in my old room, ok? - - Yup! Yup! Then... Need help with your luggage? - You need? - No thanks. No longer a child. On top of the stairs ... ...Go to the right and then straight! On the top, to the right... straight ahead! So grandmother... mother... e .. Jacques. ...that makes the pizzas. Good morning. We have not seen the wedding. Welcome, Hank. It's your first time here. Yes, the last time ... I was shooting, so ... Oh... It does not matter. It's not much fun to visit the house of your wife. Well, it's a beautiful house. - Yes, even if it is behind a prison. - Yes, indeed. - Beer? - A bit 'of water, thanks. We saw your poster at the airport, where you ... - Of the photo when it? - He chose the publisher, without asking. - But when he spoke of 100,000 copies ... - 100,000 copies? I do not know if you remember ... Maybe you've forgotten, but you promised... Thing? Recently, Jacques became an Italian cuisine expert. - No, stop... - Stop You! A great leader. - How many Michelin stars? - Four. You promised me to read the book before publishing it. - Do you remember? - Thing? - I? - Your book. I sent the draft the United States. - Maybe you have not received. - Do not you want me to read it. What nonsense! How did you get suspicious! You were as a child. This is still true, no? - Pretend you do not remember... - Again the tiramisu? You could change dessert? Appearance visits? Tiramisu, tiramisu... Welcome. Look, Toto! Look! Are you there too! Thank god! A professional photographer is another thing. We were on time. - 100,000 copies are not too many? - 50,000. How much are you conceited. It's incredible. There are pictures. Look, Ma. This is the witch of Bois de Vincennes. When I walked on the road to Paris, the children ran in panic. I think people are still dodges it passes ... You have not even kissed. Not bite mica. Do not you recognise me? Yes, smell. Someone goes to fetch the wine in the cellar? - Wants... Would you like some wine. - Yes sure! - Can I come? - Red or white? - Can I come? - Yup. Do not slip on the stairs. - Mom, come here? - No. I hate the cellar. The grandmother has me locked into it. You deserved it. He had ruined the sofa. But you forgot to be out for hours, for a drink... Fabienne Dangeville THE Verita ' But no, I was shooting! I thought I said to Luc to look after you. Oh really? You had the same book as a child? I loved him. For this I've bought. Really? - I can see it? - Yup. But after you come back in your bed. THE Strega LED Bois Vincennes IN "Once there was a witch who lived in the Bois de Vincennes." "It was a beautiful witch, but with a heart hard as stone." "And at the slightest opposition," "he turned humans into animals." Grandma was really a witch? Someone called her that once. What are you watching? Make witch? It was good or bad? Good question. - In your opinion? - Bad! - Take it easy. - Yes I know. How the script? The budget is not huge, but the director is a great admirer of his. - She watched the DVD I gave you? - It makes me seasick. With the camera that is always moving... Costa as a tripod? Without poetry. - Nowhere. - Poetry... The poetry film is required. Whether you speak of violence or of everyday banality. Yes, he's right. I'm not forced to work in a film like this. Christelle Marineau would fit perfectly into the role. - What's up? She's dead? - No, it's still alive. Sure? How are they filming? Not a big role. Manon Lenoir. The main actress. They talk very well. Needless so upset... Nothing fancy. Once, girls as well... wherever you found the street. Why are you laughing? Nothing... I ate too much lasagna. Fabienne Dangeville IN THE OF Beautiful Paris Come? You're good to brush! Do you do that to my mother? She prefers to be alone. Yes, it was already ... ...it was already so a child. Magic powers? Why? Because my friend Rose, at school, it is not very nice to me. Really? What about you? You can turn it into an animal? Come see something in the garden. See the turtle? Then? First he was a man. It bothered me , and I turned it into turtle. In what should I transform your friend? In a turtle? A toad? - In a colorful lizard. - But that would be very nice. - Or in a colorful snail. - This is not cute. All right. You have not been drinking wine, yesterday. No me... I quit. Or maybe you're waiting for an important role? Maybe yes... No... Sometimes it's easier not to... Have you seen Mom? - He was in his room. - There is no more. - Try the Chinese restaurant. - It's possible. At this time? There is often alone lately. And just, Toto! Mother? What is this? Mom? Who are you kidding? I struggle to see the truth in here. "Wait for my daughter in front of the school" "and see her running toward me filled me with joy." "Lumir always came first. We returned to the house hand in hand." "He told me about his day..." It never happened. Never! Only dad and Luc came to get me. I do not walk, I'm learning the beats. Seriously? You put post-it? You're doing a search on me? Prepare an exam? A "Fabienne in" exam? First year? Second? What are you saying... I'm an actress. I can not tell the naked truth. The truth does not excite. Perhaps you say that things cute on you. But that's not me. Why not appoint even once Sarah? They are my memories. It's my book. Will I be able to choose what to tell me, no? Do you feel guilty. Why should I feel guilty about Sarah? You know, right? What a pain in the ass! It takes everything too seriously. Who will get it? Always think of Sarah. - Always, for 40 years... - Then why... The film is shooting now I agreed only because Manon Lenoir has the main role. - Manon Lenoir? - Yup. A young actress on the rise. They say it is the new Sarah Mondavan. I did not know. Today they do a reading to Epinay Studios. Come with us? Fabienne plays the daughter Manon. My mother's memories. Manon Lenoir Fabienne Dangeville AND IN Next Film OF Hadriel Kluzynski How is New York? I do not know... from that point of view? Leave it. I do not really care. I can not stand the silence. I like. We have arrived. Luckily there was no traffic. Will past 30 years. When was that? To The dawn temptations. We are coming up with Sarah, not with you. - For Behind Look. - Oh yes.

Mom, they're beautiful, right? It is not too big for you? I have to leave tomorrow morning. Look, Ma. That looks nice. Oh yeah, that pretty lights! What would you like to do? Play the guitar. Dad says I'm too small, though ... Really? But I like it. Let me see how you do. Thank you. First position. The redo. You see? The mother returns after seven years. - Seven years. - Why? Why did he decide to live in space. In the story the mother is very ill. - Really? - On Earth would live only two years. So he decided to live in space. Because in space it does not get older. - Oh no? - Do not. - You know her, do you? - No. I have to learn the lines! Not at all funny... How long you do it? Since a long time... - I do not remember. - Me too. - Make an actress too? - In Hollywood. - Really? - Yup. There soiled. - But not? Fabienne waiting for you. - Check. Ugh! Ugh, Ugh ... Wait up! - Thank you. - You are welcome. I'm sorry about the other day. I did not want to disturb. Humanitarian causes are not for me. Sin. If only came once, it would help us a lot. I did not even have time for my dog. Sorry, we have 10 minutes late. What did I tell you? And what role do you have? I'm Amy to 38 years. Thanks in advance for his clemency. I at 38, she 73. We have different colored eyes. The director says that will change with the special effects. Then I could take Amy to 38 years. Special Effects and Go! Think I might be Amy 17 years? I do not believe. Here they are. Beautiful chutzpah, so let us wait. Once a film I used the colored contact lenses. - IS...? - My eyes were so dry that I did not stop crying. Perfect for the role. - Sorry for the delay. - Imagine. It will be the director who I did make some unnecessary scenes. And Che malalingua! Oh, she is the director? No one ever remembers my face. Still, she reminds me that director... I saw your latest movie. It seems to be a success. Thank you. I had some fantastic partners. How many pounds you lost in the final scene? Five. What a question! I I would not have ever made. Thanks for the other day. Imagine. I understand that, I have a cat. Mom! It begins. - Stop calling me "mom." - And how should I call you? - Fabienne. - Fabi. , , - Let's start reading. - Let's start. Then... scene 42. Now Amy is 38 years old. I never met Scott. We broke up three years ago. He now lives in the west. How long were you together? Six years, I think. Sin. Scott was a wimp. Dad was right. How is your father died? Serene? I can add a joke? Aimed at children. Sure. There soiled. How is your father died? Serene? Yup. Now Amy begins to cry. I will do my best. Otherwise we cut and we put drops in your eyes. Yup... sorry. Moving on to the 64? From the bedroom window we hear grandchildren Amy playing. The mother of Amy looks at them from the window. Now Amy is 73 years old. Leave me alone again, Mom? Maybe there will be a next time. But yes instead. You'll still fit at 80 years. Life has no more surprises for me. Do not say that. I'm getting old just me. You are always so young. I had no choice. But I never stopped thinking about you. Wherever it was. Please do not go without me. I feel so lonely when you're gone. Perfect. It does not seem very clear. I do not know when... Why not learn the first text? If the script was better... Yes Yes Yes. Because you took the part? I was told that I slept a lot and spoke little. And now that I have the part, added the scenes. A real scam, is not it? I find it a kindness. If you hear your fans would be so disappointed... - I was going to film with Hitchcock. The main role. - Really? Unfortunately, he died before. I would have liked to see him. He'd be dead killed... What do you think of Manon Lenoir? - Did you see how she got? - Are you really naive. It was enough to look at her to understand that he had planned. Do not you think that looks like Sarah Mondavan? - What do you think about it? - For nothing. I have to say... No, Sarah was far more animalistic ... - Much more free. - Exactly. For once we agree. Sarah must be turning in his grave for comparison. Maybe they have a similar voice. - Do you find? - Yup. A hoarse voice, very... Sarah is ruined if the purpose, with the smoke... - I loved her voice. - With alcohol... Te ne vai? So suddenly? Now that his memories are outputs... the moment has come. My son and his wife are building a house in Normandy. I'm going to look after my grandchildren. So cute. with alcohol Plan. Oh, well... I could play that part also drunk. It is no longer a little girl. For tomorrow's meeting... I'll leave the planning to Lumir. You spoke of "grandchildren"? Yup... Why? So, you have more than one? I have six grandchildren. In order: female, female, male, male, male and female. The largest, which once seen, is already in high school. My son will come later to get my stuff. Oh God... Wait up. Why are you doing so? In his memoirs, there is a line on me. He says he wants to leave. I understand, but you can not abandon it now. Without you will not make it. I? - You are a beautiful couple. - It is out of the question. And then on Sunday I go back to New York. At least wait until the end of the shoot. Here. I go. What happens? Pope... what are you doing here? - Hello, my child. - Where did you get in? From the back gate! How many questions. Can I come in? Yes. But it's not a good time. Why? She has a new boyfriend? It bothers me more, quiet. Hello. Thanks for taking care of Fabienne. No, he's with me. Yes, I'm Hank, the husband of Lumir. In fact, it seemed... he had exaggerated this time. You are a disaster. Why did you come? And you? They came to celebrate the book's release. Really? You came to New York for this? And you instead? The same. I have come to congratulate. There it is! Come. - Who is it? - Your grandfather. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What's your name? - Charlotte. I am Pierre. The father of your mother. - Pierre? - Yup. What do you live now, Daddy? I knew it. Do you need money. You could pay me the rights for speaking of my life. Thing? Not much on me, huh? in the book you're dead, Dad. - Dead? - You can look, you're like. - Dead... dead? - You took my teapot? Hurry up! Remember that you have taken the place of Luc. I forgot. I forgot one thing, the triangle... - Hurry up! - Check! - You took the thing with the dog? - This? - Yes. - What for? Mom, Pierre has disappeared! - Mom, Pierre has disappeared! - Will come back. Now we have to go. - What are you up to? - This is Anna. Hello, Amy. You are always more beautiful. It can not fall so in my life every seven years! Dai, Amy... It is always the case at this time. Do you have a boyfriend? I wish that my mother had asked me. Then, you have it? I love that smell. It smells, Mom. Welcome home, Mom. Thank you, Amy. How old was your mother when she died? 29. I I was seven. You've never been sad, or jealous of the other girls? You did not come to see the performance... ...lo show in which I acted, in junior high. Do not you remember? - Are you sure? - very safe. I'll ricorderesti, The Wizard of Oz. You were Dorothy, right? - The scarecrow? - No. The person who came to the shows and who helped me when I was heartbroken was Sarah. Yes, maybe. It's better than trascurarti and at the same time being intrusive, no? You too... you've spent any time on a spaceship. I look so young? I did not mean that. Only now you understand that I did not ever like to live on Earth. Here, it's for you. I've got the same. What happens? My dog died. I just buried. But I spoke with Manon and now I'm better. Never trust a woman who loves cats. Take as an example. He unbridled ambition. At least you have not lost your appetite. He never wanted to act? - No, it is not for me. - Ok. And I suppose... She wanted more attention from her mother. - How Amy in the film. - No, not really. So why she does not want her mother's hair touches? - Did he tell my mother? - Yup. He told me that as a child he could always take care of herself. It seemed sad about it. From the joke. How is your father died? Serene? Yes, he died very serene. - That's no good? - It's not easy. Hadriel, and if playing with the hair? He would do the same gesture of Amy when she was 17. Good idea. Will we see the monitor. How could he? It takes a lock from underneath and turns a bit '. I would have thought so. Yup. Before coming, I was on his grave. On Dad's grave? Yup. It must have been dirty. Stop! We're done, thank you. They improvise constantly. The result is good. That's going to tell his life. Well but you... Look Who's Talking. You do it too. I? To who? A Manon. Have you talked to me. I do not remember. What did he say to you? If you do not remember, never mind. We find a new recipe ... I want to throw my agenda. And buy a new one ... Ouch... The hands! Here we are. - I can do a little 'me? - No you can not. - Oh yes. It's easier. - Right? I put it here. - You know, the traitor. I do not like. - Gaspard is the traitor, you know ... Mom, I participated. Jacques, there's still the salad? Do not you think you still look a bit 'a turtle? - Have you forgiven? - Just for today. Stan, your character shot in the head. Very probably he dies. - The shot in the head... - No, it does not. - and will not survive! - You did not think he had been shot? And not... I'll're saying! - I got shot in the shoulder. - At the shoulder? Yes, not in the head. Blood splatters and... No, it is very clear. I do not believe it. Your wife remarries before you heal. I do not know, do not give me the script. I swear, if I knew I would tell you, but I do not know. - Do not tell me anything. - No, really. Now he has the best proposals. Portal a pillow. The offer many other parts. without an audition, for me it means a lot. I'm beginning to be a real actor. An actor... I think it's great that you have stopped drinking to get leading roles. - Good decision! - Oh, no, yes... Quiet. There is time before a starring role. Mother... What luck, really. I mean, today's players can play anywhere. Also in the series on the internet. Today everyone can be actors. But have you watched his show? I saw it on YouTube. You have so insisted. But among the imitations I prefer those of Pierre. "Paris, martyred." "But Paris liberated!" Acting is so much more. What counts is personality. The presence. The Hélène role, for which you won the César... Yes. What? In fact, he had to interpret Sarah. Gliel'hai stolen by sleeping with the director. The I produced the film. Did not you see? Fabienne was really spectacular. What do you say? He was the assistant. - Was... - You read that on Wikipedia? Everybody knows. Sarah was preparing him, and if you had not stolen him, César would win her. You knew very well that you would never reached Sarah level, then... hast destroyed the private life. Are you with me or against me? To hear you, it seems that I killed her. It is not so? Even if he got the part by sleeping with the director, which changes? Less good actress would do the same, but it would be gone. But I'm here. That is what matters. Why do not you go to bed? You were very good tonight, honey. Good night. I saw that litigavi with Sarah. She was crying. The night before. It was destroyed on the couch. We argued often. Being very friendly, we could afford. That night was different, as if ... He was going to die. I could feel it. No it does not. The next day we would go to the sea ... I canceled at the last moment. - At the sea? - Yes, the sea. In Deauville. I do not remember. If it was so sad, he could accompany her. I would have to, yes. She was drunk. He wanted to swim. Though... it was my fault, if it had been a great actress, She would turn her pain into art. They not all are as strong as you. It is not a sin to be strong. Sarah was kind. That was what I liked about her. Too bad I was not his daughter. Yes, a real shame. I will never forgive you for what you did. - Lumir ... - Stay out of this, please. None of your business. Who do you think you are to decide not to forgive? - Only Sarah might decide. - Shit, he has been drinking. I was a bad mother, a bad friend, but so what? I prefer being a bad mother, a bad friend and a good actress. And if you do not forgive me, I forgive the audience. Because I'm telling you these things? I do not know what I feel the actors ... - I'll come back to New York? - I go to the bathroom. It is' attentive to the couch. How do you endure such a woman? Congratulations. Save your energy for acting. It is not a work that is done in half. Everyday life does not count. You know what I think? When actresses are dedicated to social or political, Thank you. they have lost in their profession. They lost the battle on the screen, then plunge into reality. They pretend to lash out against reality. Do you understand? It is the opposite. I've always won that battle. For this I stand the loneliness. Yes and then... invert the scene 47 and that of Central Park. So the lover's character will be more clear, I think. Thank you so much for talking to us. It was... very enlightening. Thanks so much. Really you want to come tomorrow? - And why I'd come to Paris? - Well. - start at 1 1 - Ok. Good night. Oh God... Your mother kissed me ... Born that ... Born that. But here. Right here. How many glasses did you drink? How many are there in a bottle? Because you said you had stopped to get a role? I never said, I do... - Please do not start drinking. - I have never said that. - I'm sorry. - Again with this nightmare? I'm tired of lying to Charlotte telling her that you're shooting. - I know I'm sorry. - Fermo. - I know. - That's enough. - What did you talk for two hours? You do not even speak French. It will be boasted all the time. In fact it seemed sad. - Really? - Yes, really. Very sad. I did not know you had come to see my mother reciting. No? I'm his fan. A big fan of his. You can go in my place, so do the tea. Yes. You know I do not like tea. You know... Why did you bring me here? Eh? Why? If you just wanted to talk about the book, why did you bring me here? The last time I came, you were in detox, if you remember... I think I wanted to make her jealous. Show her our happy family. But she will not be jealous. You do not smite you with this. And do not you strike with ... a series of American TV actor B. I sleep a bit ', ok? I'm here if you need. - Did you pee? - Yup. I will go after. What are you doing? Repairs. Yes, I gave it when she was little. In honor of his performance in The Wizard of Oz. - It was Dorothy? - No. The lion. But your mother was a fantastic Leone! - She's a wimp? - Yes No... She understood very well that he felt the Lion. "Do not scare me!" Pierre! What happens? I heard the voice of Lumir in the garden. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Did you use your magic powers? - Magic powers? Grandfather Pierre disappeared. She asked him to once again become a turtle. Ah okay. Pierre went away? Last evening. He could spend the night. And why? Beautiful chutzpah to call 'Pierre' the turtle. Perhaps to punish me for having driven away his father. Do not you think it was sad instead? It does not have much time. I understand. Rest, promised. Are you happy to be my daughter? Yes, I'm happy to be your daughter. - What a voice. - It's his forte. This tea is hot! I burned. Look here. I can not drink hot things... I like cats. I forgot you hate cats. You are crazy! If you serve in a bar denounce you! Do not add water! It ruins the taste of tea! They were forced to come. He says that you were not obliged. A promise is a promise. Why come to Paris, if not? I said really? Do you prefer this rather than keep company with Jacques. Seems Michèle Morgan He has lived in that apartment. Have you noticed that the initials of all the great actresses... they are equal? Simone Signoret. As a young man was gorgeous. Greta Garbo. Anche Anouk Aimée. - And Brigitte Bardot. - Oh, that's right. 64/2. Second. Machine ready. Action! Happy birthday, Grandma. Happy birthday, Grandma... That's grandmother. Leave me alone again, Mom. Please do not go. I feel so lonely when you're gone. - Stop! - Stop, please. If I do that is not clear who is the mother. - Can we do it again? - Sure. I never stopped thinking about you. Wherever I found myself. It rang a phone! Turn off cell phones before the shoot! You'll still fit at 80 years. Life has no more surprises... you can get out of my sight? It is she who plays my nephew. Therefore... There I had it with her. I had no choice, but I have never stopped thinking about you. Shit, this is the beat of the mother! Stop! What advice can I give her? - No, you do not tell her anything. - Yes but... Forget it, trust me. Sometimes you just have to... Happy Birthday AMY - Motor! - Motor... He turns. 64/2. Eighth. Machine ready. Action! Leave me alone again, Mom? Maybe there will be a next time. Yes but. You'll still fit at 80 years. Life has no more surprises for me. Do not say that. You stay young. I'm getting old just me. I had no choice. But I never stopped thinking about you. Wherever I found myself. Please do not leave without me. I feel so lonely when you're gone. Stop! Sorry, the redo. Why redo? Must ... it was perfect... but more concise. You should shorten it by 20 /. We're shooting an advertisement? Some water? No thanks. - Sorry for Grandma? - No... It's been good. Yes. It was good, of course. Sorry. I want to see you play. - Want to see me play? - Yup! - Really? - Yup! Yes, come, sometimes. Whenever you want! - When you do not go to school. - When you do not go to school, of course. - If mom makes me. - Yup... Before, when you were playing, did you come up with something? - A memory, perhaps? - Guy? A memory of your mother, for example? My mother is a black hole. In the photos it seems very close-knit. You can not trust the memory even when you recite. The memories come and go. When you came to the studio, it all seemed smaller... There's the ice? Do not make the princess, please. What do I do with Luc? For starters, you apologize. Ma... I never apologized to a man. Did you ever betrayed but you 're never apologized, even once? - An actress does not ... - You looked tired. But you're back a beast. Could you write something for me? Thing? A text to apologize to Luc. Do not mention it. Yes and I will interpret word for word. I do not know. I have to think. I'm not sure. "You know you smoke. In short!" "He calls me 'mom' in front of everyone." "No, she does not understand." "I was ashamed." "The worst is that he does not know even make a tea." "Tea, yes, a tea." - Do you want to go to sleep? - No, I like to listen to you. What are you working on? I'm writing something for my mother. The song Fabienne. "I swear..." "I swear, it's hot ..." "I burned ..." "I'm lucky to have a husband." I am lucky to have a husband. You should take care of most of those around you. Perhaps he is saying... "I accepted this role for you" or... You must learn modesty. I already know. - I already know. I'm not stupid. - Then... Your biggest flaw of man is banging things in the face the person directly affected. The good tactless intentions are the most painful. My tongue forked the comparison is harmless. Sorry. I'm sorry. Your only quality is to know you'll excuse me, how did you do now. Exaggerate. I have also other. Can I ask you a question? They ended up as an actress? Do not answer. You could tell the truth. I'm too scared. What was the sweet last night? Cassata. Who gave you the recipe? My mother, a long time ago. No matter who it was. I think I prefer... your tiramisu. It's nothing bad. Here is the second quality. We say yes. Two quality... are the necessities of life. Do not you want to play. Here. Before you. We drink, standing ... He told me that he would arrive in three minutes. But we waited outside for 15 minutes. At the risk of getting sick! With the strikes, there is no traffic. His job is to anticipate the strikes. For this I feel. Unbelievable. Do you think you'll excuse? For nothing. Instead of complaining, do you think you can? - What are you talking about? - Do you remember everything? No, Charles! Who else? - Françoise! - Good. I need to reduce the text? Reduce the number of children. Let's get this piece of paper a worm. - It moves! - Do not touch it! You are crazy? - It moves? - What does it mean 'moves'? Is alive! Eat your children's fingers? Yup... Do not touch it! You are crazy? - Are you joking. - It is completely crazy. How are they filming? Do not learn his lines. And it is miserable with Manon. Before it was not.
