Let's talk a little more together. All right. Anyway I have nothing to do... You still do not want to talk today? Yes. If you do not speak I can not help. Can you really help me? Yes? What did you say? Nothing. Why, what's up? Busy? After work, buy something to eat for me. What would you like to eat? What should I buy? Hello? Hello? Can she say something before hang up? Who is it? It's me. Is there another person to come? You do not know, maybe... I woud not eat these! You liked them before. Cann't you just eat them this time? So, what am I going to say? Just eat it as I bought for you. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted. Why does mom always speak like I did wrong? What did I do wrong to you? What did you do so well to me? Huh? That good college entrance without graduating college... That was a long ago! I dropped the medical shool! Is that a sin? How did I raise you? You married a wrong girl... No, no, no! told you how many times! Not because of her! You should have lived well then, huh? At your age, you would not marry again? Ah... so stressful! Please stop, please... I will leave. You, there... Next Monday Can you share some time? Why? Next week, housekeeper leaves early. Who is going to give me a dinner? Okay, then I'll come. You really like to note memos! ‘Clean the toilet’ ‘After you clean the toilet then Look for another note above your face’ What the hell is that? Toilet? I don't sleep and what am I doing... I feel good after cleaning. Other notes Where are they? Ah! it will be above my face. ‘When you can not sleep with stress Cleaning the toilet is the best’ ‘You could not sleep but can sleep well today’ Really? Nonsense. My family treats me like a invisible person. They avoid me to talk. When I worked and made money I did not have time to talk with them. But the kids used to send me messages. And tried to talk... These days, they don't talk with me at all... I really can not sleep well recently. I recently moved on I could not sleep well because the bed was changed. However... somebody told me ‘How to sleep well’. - Would you like to try it? - What is it? Before you go to the bed, try anything physically. For example like toilet cleaning. Oh, does it work? I don't care whatsoever. Try to find anything you do physically. Once you set your mind, there are many things to do. It was worked for me. No wonder memo in here. What's this? Organizing your living room? Ah! Okay, let's try it. ‘A gift for you who finished cleaning up clothes’? Gift? Really? You are not kidding? It's a real gift. How is going yourself with company? Yes, I try. Trouble with my boss every day... That's why I'm nervous every day. I can not work any longer. Not long ago I moved to new house. But strange former house owner left this little gift in the house. Okay. The former owner is so annoyed I found this and it was a bit scared. I thought she was tryiong to make some jokes. This was hide in really deep inside of the kitchen. Putting my hand in it. How nervous... But since I found this I appreciated it. That was funny. It was not a big deal but I was nervous. Yes. Former house owner was a little unusual. Is that right? If I gave up looking for this because I was scared. I did not get a gift, the former owner prepared. Anxiety... I think so. Putting your hand at the place you don't know. Something bad can be happened, Unexpectedly May be a good gift can be received. If you don't do anything because you are scared. Nothing will happen. Do you still don't want to talk to me today? I do not have much to say. Really? It's difficult situation. It looks I am wasting this time. Here I want to say. I'm the one who needs to listen your troubles. That's my job. So I can wait you. Until you want to share your problem. So here is my suggestion. Whenever you need me then let me know. I do not care what you say, okay? Fried rice recipe Egg Roll Recipe Anchovy Fried Recipe Today is your last consultation. How was consultation? Helpful? At first, I was not sure with your help. It seems to be getting better. And as you told me I clean the bathroom I also did housework. This was surprisingly effective. Looking at the housework. This is just about to breathe. There is also reward. My family also likes... As far as I know, they've been watching my eyes quite a bit. They wonder if it hurts my feeling. I didn't know their caring. I could not realize it... That's great! I was helped to you. Yes. What is daughter-in-law nowadays? Not a slave... Does only his son works? I also work hard, too. Really? I think you are right? Surly! Did I tell you another woman's story? No, you did not. She was so funny saying. My son is ugly and bad student. Do not play with his son. Really? Her son eye size is different. And that lady also... has different eye size! Her son is such ugly. And how she can talk about my son. That's right. If my child looks a little like me It would have been better. - Yeah, it's a little disappointing. - Isn't it? And... I thought it was no different. It's okay to take it. I came here and talk to you can sleep well. I'm stressed out and released. Really? I'm really glad. Oh, wait a minute. Here. What's this? I'm making candles these days. Light it on, the fragrance was very good. Your mind can be comfortable I also feel... Hope this helps. Ah! Of course, I am not asking you to hold the stress. I like lavender flavor... Thanks. See you again next week. Yes. Goodbye. Yes. Wow, I did not know you are such a good cook. My wife even can not prepare this lunch box. Thank you. However... how Jisoo came and consult with the clinic? Until recently... she has been very serious situation. She did not want to go to the school. Attempted suicide... Oh... yeah? I did not realize... Normally she is okay. Suddenly, she often becomes uncontrollable. Once in the school, she attempted suicide. Of course, school asked her to go to the hospital. But her parents never agreed their daughter to go to the hospital. Inevitably, she came here. Yes. So no one knows why? She did not want to speak any... Only parents may know why. However, parents... they do not admit daughter's problem. That's more of a problem. In the future, give more attention to her. Yes, I understand. Ah, but... You know who is my house former owner? May I ask? Why? You said there is no problem in your house, why do you want to know? Yes, that is right... I am just curious. Don't you have more consultations in this afternoon? - Huh? - Yes, yes... It's delicious. Tasty! Mom! You should eat after dinner. You would be full to eat dinner. What? Do not worry, I will have a dinner. But this is very good! No way! Stop eat it now. If you eat rice, I will give you. Son! Thanks. What? Just everything. Wow, it's really good. This is really good, my goodness. Hello? Is that you, Jisu? Where? How did you get here? In case, I called your parents for you. You did not have to... Anyway, the place is closed on Saterday? Of course, we only work during weekdays. Isn't too composed. What if you have a sick person on Saturday? Is this a hospital? This is the place for listening people's stories. What if I want to talk on Saturday? You are right. I did not think about it. Anyway, I can make an appointment any time for you. Well adults are untidy. You are right. Most adults are selfish. Okay, can I understand you want to talk? Hold on a second. Wait! Hold on. Before you eat, I want to tell you something. There is a story in the movie I watched. ‘Life is like a chocolate box’ You can not figure which chocolate you will take until it is opened. Like chocolate box, people can not predict their life. All chocolate are delicious, isn't it? Cacao 99%? No, it's not! There are variety flavors in a chocolate box. Sometimes, it's hard to live and deal. But there will be a good time surly. Can I eat now? Yes. I would like to ask, if your problem is with your parents? I hate my mother. She think I am a just doll. She likes to control my whole life. I am very choked and feel like to be killed. Really? I also... Teacher, too? You are an adult. Yes, I am. So the situation is even worse. We have to be like this whole life time? Maybe? But when you become an adult, then someday your mom become grandmother. If so, without you, your mom may not be able to do anything. Just like a baby? Yes, like a baby. And that timing... comes really quick. So my suggestion is... “Let's hold and endure just a bit more” Really? When the time comes then revenge! Yes, that is correct. Is there any more memos? This is my last memo. If you find this, you may know every corner of this house. And if you've seen other notes you have finished your house cleaning? What are you doing? Now, do not just stay home. Go outside and enjoy. For your journey, I leave this. Gwanghwamun Gate There aren't such a big problem. Your stress level is just a bit higher than normal. I was understood it was very serious. Anything happened to you recently? I am realizing these days. People influence to other much without recognizing it. I see a little now. I probably can influence... to others in a good way. That makes me very comfortable. I think fear is for everyone. Every time I meet people, I'm afraid. But that's not my fault, right? Yes. I think I am now better than begining. So... I will try to find a new job. Really? Why? I do not think it really suits your aptitude. Not in a hurry, But try to find a place more appropriate for me. All right. You will find it for sure. If you're worried again Please come back any time. Yes, thank you. Next time, it is not for consultation but entertaining with you. Health Counseling Room - Hello. - Yes, hello. Senior, I would like to ask you a favor. I was wondering if I could meet the last owner of my house. There is no problem in the house. Hard to explain... I have some thing to tell her. I am glad... there is no problem in the house. However, the last owner of your house. I mean... the last owner of your house was the one of patient in this clinic. “How to be loved” And she was in really serious situation. She was not able to go out side alone. Even coming to this clinic for the consultation. And she decided to go back to her parents'house that suddenly moved to another house. She was mentally troubled and lived all alone in the house.
