Where does this story begin? I'm not really sure I can answer that. My life is so full of twists and turns, trying to stay afloat. Beat down by every wave and swell that life threw my way. And that's just how life is, I guess. Alone, out there. I had no one, and needed no one. It was my story, and I was the writer. Until... Until... I forgot what I was even writing about. Come on, Asher. Let's go. So, how is your writing assignment going? I'm writing this one about a solo surfing trip in Mexico, 20-some years ago. I got caught up in this crazy storm... It sounds like progress. Let's get inside. - So what happened? - What? In the storm. What happens in that story? I don't know. Something that's hard to explain. What are the other stories you're writing about? Come on. Eh, cigarette? Sure. You should quit. Those things'll kill ya. You can't write anything if you're dead. You're gonna sit there all day... - You put this all on me? - Like every day watching that stupid game. It's not my fault we aint got no money. You don't even care. Shut it off and be responsible for once. My, Michelle, would you shut up? We should talk about this. What? They're gonna shut off our electricity, Jeff. What do you want me to do about it? Well maybe you should get another job. Yeah. Then you can sit around on your lazy butt all day doing your hair. I know. Why don't you file child support on the little blonde girl of yours? Are you saying you don't like my hair, baby? You know why I married you, baby? Because you're a real man. Right? Ow. Get off of me, you jerk. Ow. Ow. And next thing you know, I'm on a nightmare of a binge. I almost died, but instead I ended up in the VA hospital. My choices controlled me. But forgiveness freed me. Hey! Hold up a minute. Yeah? Sorry, I just realized that I never introduced myself. I'm Clay. You can call me Roy. I really liked what you said in there. Well, thanks, I guess. Why are you here? Just to start over, I guess. How's that going for you? Good days, bad days. Addiction cost me almost everything. Almost? Family, friends. Only God was there at the end. The only one who stuck with me through the puke and pain. The only reason I'm still here. Wow. What are you runnin' from, Clay? Your coffee, Mr. Bauer? - Two sugars? - Black. Good man. Oh, and David Walker called about the rental contracts? Did you send those off? Well accounting said that we're still waiting for escrow to confirm so we can't really do any... Don't worry about what accounting says. Just send off those contracts. Okay. - Hey, Danny. - Clay. - How's it goin'? - I'm very relaxed. Are you at the spa again? I have high stress levels thanks to your man Rudolph. Randolph. Yeah, he's depositing 12 million on Monday as planned. It isn't there until it's there. Come on, Danny, he's good for it. I'm betting the farm on it. You're betting my farm. Relax. You're gonna make enough money on this film to buy all the farms you want. Hey, try and have some fun this weekend. And remember, your stress levels. Try and get Randolph on the phone. I haven't been able to reach him all day. But just keep that between the two of us. Okay. Check it out. It's 1600 an ounce. And since Martina's your lady, you're familia now. At this price, I could probably move a couple of kilos for you. Orale, let's do it, man. What's that? Police! Hands up, hands up, don't move, don't move! What were you thinkin'? Look, I've got it handled. You were in a house with six kilos of cocaine. We're about to close escrow and start shooting. It'll be okay. Besides my lawyer says we can get the probation dropped after one year. If I stay out of trouble. Small chance of that. I'm giving you one last chance. Now get back to work and get out of here, go on. I don't even wanna see you. Danny. It's six am. First call's not 'til eight. Hello. May I speak with uh, Mr. Bauer, please? Who is this? I'm the editor of the Neue Zuürcher, the international newspaper in Zurich. Yes? You are currently producing a film with Danny Keith and Randolph Sexton is your, uh, financier? Yes. I bet you did not know that his real name is Joachim Schmidt. He is the most wanted man in all of Switzerland. And he was arrested on your film which now I'm afraid is an asset of the Swiss government... I like your dog. Oh, yeah, this is Asher. He goes with me everywhere. So I don't have a sponsor yet and they said I need to have on to keep coming back. Well, I meet with Richard once a week and we, oh yeah. Sure. - Yeah? - Sure. Hey, you wanna go get some coffee? I love coffee. - Now? - Well yeah. You know that place, they have baked goods. You know what place I'm talking about, downtown. There's lots of sweet stuff. They make the best cakes there. - Yeah. - They got coffee. Sure, how about, uh... Yeah, Tuesday. 3:30. You be there. Sure. You know what I have in my hand here? It's a 30 days to pay or quit. No! You know what that means, don't you? - No! - You got 30 days in full or you're out. No, Jeff just started his new job this week. You know what? Even then it's just a personal paycheck. It's not my problem. - Please! - I don't wanna hear it. We're trying our best. You got 30 days. Who was that, mommy? Oh shut up, and let me think! What? I'm the one that caught the fish. All right. Oh, look, a letter from the government. "Dear Mr. Bauer, "You are alleged to be the natural father "of Sophie Underwood under the authority" "of the state of Utah..." ♪ This world tonight ♪ ♪ I'll be there holding you oh so tight ♪ ♪ Nobody there but us ♪ ♪ But I'll love you just for tonight ♪ Hello? Hey, yeah, he just woke up. It's James, from the bar. Hey, James. What's up? Please tell me that's not the girl from last night. What do you care? Her husband is here, waiting for you, bro. She's married? Yep, and he's got killin' in his eyes. Are you kidding me? Uh, hey, uh, I gotta get going. Aww, what? Playin' hard to get? I dig that. No. I gotta go, I gotta wash up first. Want some company? Nope, sorry. It's 4:15 pm. What? Coffee. Coffee? Sure, I'd love some. Yeah, there's still some left over. Did you walk here? Sure did. You were late. Oh, sorry. What's wrong, Clay? Nothin'. That's not what Asher says. Just kiddin'. I don't speak dog. Well... I guess. It says I'm a dad. What? I wouldn't make a good dad. I'm a broke filmmaker. I could barely even afford to feed Asher, let alone a little girl. It's a girl? Yeah. This isn't about you, this is about her. Being a good dad doesn't have anything to do with what kind of clothes you wear, what your job is. Being a good dad is about you choosing to love her, more than comfort, more than your own fears, and your dreams. Loving her is the most important choice you will ever make. And maybe the only thing that can save her. And you. Save her? Listen, can we talk about this another time? Just don't wait too long. Don't wait too long, Clay. Here we go. Hi. Hi. Are you Sophie? Oh, uh, this is Asher. And uh, this is for you. Or you can do that. Clay. Hey. Hey. Sophie, this is your father. And this is Cindy and Peter. Well, it's a nice day. Come on you guys, let's let Sophie get to know her father. Oh no. Hey babe, what you doin' home? I got fired. What's going on here? Who is this? This is Sophie's father, he came to see her. What's wrong with mailing your checks like everybody else? You know, child support isn't some open invitation to come on over whenever you want to. Kids, you get inside! Now! Will you take care of this guy for me? I'm gonna come see you again soon. I promise. Come on, Asher. Oh, man. I'm so sorry about your truck. Oh, don't worry about that. I'm Clay. I'm Lisa. So work, what do you do? I'm in health and life insurance. Oh, so that's why you agreed to have lunch with me. You thought I'd make a good client. You caught me. I just get cute guys to get into fender benders and take me out to lunch. Well, it's effective. Thank you. So, do you have any family here? My kids. Kids, huh? Yup. I've got two of 'em. A boy and a girl. And you? Uh well, actually, I have a daughter I just found out about. Um, it's complicated. I can't see her without her mom's permission. ♪ You made ♪ ♪ Made the sun shine ♪ ♪ Made the moon bright through the night ♪ ♪ You came and made these blind eyes ♪ ♪ Open wide and see the light ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Mom? Yes, Cody? May I please be excused? Looks like you still have some greens on your plate. Um... Good chicken. All right kids, you can be excused. You're an amazing mom. Thank you. I try. Are you okay? Uh, yeah. It's just been a long time since I've had a family style dinner. I'm glad it finally worked out. If you want, Kelly and I are going to make pizza on Sunday. Hm, I'll be going to Salt Lake on Saturday. Oh, okay. Thank you. Maybe next time. Yeah, sure. Look, if you're not comfortable here, you don't have to stay. No, no, it's great here. Everything is just so perfect. But all I can think about is my little girl living in a different world, not having any of this nice stuff. Just one mess after another. I'm sorry. I don't mean to weigh you down with all this baggage. No. It's fine. No, really, I'm sorry. Hey. I'm here, and I wanna be here. Woo hoo! Come on, Sophie. Give it a try. You do your own stunts? Kids! Inside! Do you need any help? We're fine. What are you doing with this guy? Listen, you're sweet. But I know what I'm doing. You wanna stay for lunch? No, I got plans later. Whoa. Sophie. Come on. Put your new bike away. Here you go. All right. I'll stop trying to give you hugs. Can we at least shake hands? There we go. All right. Hey, say goodbye to Asher. Bye, Asher. Bye, sweetie. I'll see you soon. Bye. Why did Sophie get a new bike and I didn't? Sophie's father is just trying to buy her affection. Gifts like that never last. My bike got stolen. You let it get stolen. I bet, with your dad's new job, he'll be able to buy us all some nice, new things. I'm all done. Finish your food. You heard your mom. Finish your food. Now! Jeff, go cool down. Open the door, Michelle. Open the door! Mom? Don't do anything stupid. Don't tell me what to do. Hello? Anybody home? Come on in. I'll be down in just a minute. I'll be ready in a minute. Wow. I hope you're hungry. Our reservation is for 5:30. All right, let me get my lipstick and eyeliner on, I'll be right there. Shut up. Clay, we need your help. Things got out of control and I've got the kids and we're at the diner in the west valley. What's wrong? Hey Michelle. How's it taste? What are you doing here? I, I'm so sorry. I got out of control. That's right. But I'll make sure everything's cool and that you don't hit her anymore, right? I'm so sorry, Michelle. I messed up. Can you give me one more chance? I'll do whatever you want. You promise? What's going on? You called him? What are you doing here, Jeff? You need to leave now. Oh yeah? Are you gonna make me? It's okay. No, it's not okay. Look at her face. We had a little misunderstanding. It's all better now. Beat it. That's a little misunderstanding? Thanks for breakfast, Clay. We'll do this again another time. You expect me to let you leave with him? Let my daughter leave with him? This has nothing to do with you. You aint go no right tellin' anybody in here what to do. Daddy? Sophie. Come on kids. I'll call you later. This isn't gonna get better, Michelle. It's time to leave, pal. Now's a good time. ♪ Bring me back to Jesus ♪ Oh you don't, you don't mind if I, you know? Would you like some coffee with that? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a new dust on your truck out there. Yeah. I just got back from Salt Lake. How's Sophie? Good, I guess. Whole situation's just a mess. You know, I just have a sinking feeling that one of these days, they're gonna run, and I'm not gonna see Sophie again. Pretty bummer of an outlook on life. Well. Life aint always got happy endings. So you've been, uh, staying sober? I've got something for you. Roy, answer my question. Oh yeah, of course. Yeah. But that's not why you wanted to meet up. Oh really? You wanted to know how to be a good dad, right? From you? No. From him. Who are you trying to be like when you wanna be a better dad with Sophie? I don't know. More like my father, minus all the things he wasn't good at. You said it yourself. Well, no dad is perfect, but, what if I told you, as dads, we act like pictures of something bigger than ourselves? What? I don't know what to do. Help me, please. What? I can't always just talk to you. They are so screwed up down there, and it seems like there's nothing I can do. You'll probably never get to see her long if you don't get serious and take some responsibility. Get a job. Pray for clarity. Pray for clarity? ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ Hello?

I'll be down there in a minute. What's the matter? I gotta go down to the shop. Bye, sweetie. Goodbye, daddy. You clean up good. Yeah. I got a job in LA I gotta get to. It's cute, seeing you all cleaned up. Listen, I wanna talk to you about Sophie's name. What, you don't like her name now? Her last name. I think it should be Bauer. Sure, Clay. Go for it. But don't think that makes you her daddy. You push too far, I'll make sure you never see her again. I love him, Stan. Give me a break. You don't think that I can change, now do you? I don't think you'll ever change. You're impossible! Oh, Stan. Oh, um, uh, crap. Cut! Cut! Lily, her name is Lily. Okay, everyone let's go. What's wrong with you? Where did you go to acting school?

You should get a helicopter. I got to ride in one after the wreck. It was awesome. That's a good idea, I'll work on it. Well, you're a whole lot better than a frog. Hey, doc. Yes? I'm Sophie's biological father. Is there anything you can tell me? What do you mean? I only hear one side of the conversation. I just wanna know the truth. There's bruising that I can't account for. Okay. I've seen children in family situations like this in a lot of so-called convenient accidents. So what are you saying? If she was my daughter, I wouldn't let her out of my sight. Let her out of my sight? Hey. Hey. Can I come in? It's all my fault. I got too close. My daughter's malnourished and homeless again. I tried to be something I'm not. Now, I'll never see Sophie again. I'm proud of you, papa bear. Roy, she's gone. I'm done. I don't think so. You're still breathin', aren't ya? They'll show up again, they always do, and then you gotta snatch her out. Snatch her up, get her out of that mess. Stop. What are you so scared of, Clay? Just stop, Roy. What's keeping you from taking that next step? Roy, stop. You know, I don't see you doing anything to fix up your life. So who are you to give me advice? Roy, I'm sorry. No. You're right. I can't save her. God can. He saved you, so that you can save her.

And now I don't know where they are, or if she's even okay. That's quite a story. Yeah, I know. I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. Do you own your home? No. I rent. Are you married? No. Ever file for bankruptcy? No. Do you have any children other than Sophie? No. Look, I know I'm not the best of guys. But I love my daughter. I believe you, Clay, and I'm willing to take your case. Our firm requires a deposit of $7000. One more question, Mr. Bauer, have you ever been convicted of a felony? Mr. Bauer? Uh, deposit check. Is that going to be a problem? What now, God? Well, where in the world did you get that? You want valet parking, too? What, you jealous? Come on. Now run down to the set and make sure everything's in order. You got any kids? What? I don't know, it's just something that's never come up between us before, I was curious. I don't like to mix work with family. But yeah, sure, I got a few. They live with their mother, it's better that way. Do you get to spend much time with them? Listen, I didn't get to where I am by becoming a good family man. I got here by making a choice to do one thing good, and this is it. You're fooling yourself if you think it'd be otherwise. Hey. Hold on. Come on. Mmm. There, you happy? Now go. See you later. Okay. Same time. I miss Sophie so much. Hello, this is Clay. Eh, Rocky's in jail. He beat me up. Is Sophie okay? We need help. Where are you? We're at a motel in St. George just off the interstate. Did he hurt her, Michelle? Michelle? Room 103. Michelle? Hey, I just got a call from Michelle. She's at a motel in St. George. I guess Rocky beat her up. If they go off the grid again, there'll be nothing that I can do. Okay. This may be our one and only shot, Clay. All right, Lord. Hi. Hi. Hi. Daddy. Hi, honey. Oh, I missed you so much. Hi, Asher. Hey, what happened to the truck? Oh, that old thing? I needed a little change. Mommy said I can go with you for a few days. Really? Wow, that's great. Are you okay? You shouldn't have come. I thought you said he was in jail. He just got out two hours ago. Hey Clay, old buddy. It's been a while. Is this your new ride? Hey Rocky, what are you doing here? You're here to pick up my daughter for the weekend? Yeah, a wedding. Well that's nice. No one told me about it. Well I suppose if you quit changing your cell number. This weekend's not gonna work. We have our own family plans. Sophie's gonna be with her father this weekend, so she can be around a real man for a change. And who knows, maybe I'll go, too. Sophie, go with your father. Wanna see a real man, Michelle? No, no, Rocky! I thought I told you to stay away from what's mine! No! She's mine. Come on, honey, we gotta go. My dad gave me that knife. Michelle Howard? - Yes. - This is an emergency court order for the custody of Sophie Bauer, signed by a judge up in Salt Lake City. Sorry. No. This is a long trip. Are we really going to Aunt Susie's wedding? Yes, but not yet. They don't get married 'til later this summer. Then, where are we going? Just try it. It looks funny. It's gluten free. Does gluten make stuff taste any better? Please, just taste it. She made it especially for you. Yuck, I don't like. Hey, where's your manners? I ate all mine, mom. I ate all mine too, daddy. That food was gross. Shh. I know, right? I love you, honey. Everything's gonna be all right. Get some rest. You have a big day tomorrow. Good night. Good night. Hey, um, we should pray. What? Well it's just talking to God. Okay. I'm not very good at it, but... Dear God, thank you for bringing Sophie and I together. Thank you for having a plan, helping us out, even when I doubted you. You're the best, Lord. Lead us home and please, help us in court. Amen. Daddy? Yes? I love you. - I love you too. - I love you more. I'm glad you finally got to meet her. She's just not used to that kind of food yet. It's not about the food. This whole lifestyle's new. Why didn't you call me last time you were in town? It was a weekend trip. And I had some things I needed to talk about with Roy. Really? You can confide in your whacked out, drunk friend, not me? Roy's not a drunk. Look. I supported you on your move to LA and your constant on and off again stuff with Sophie. I need you to understand my position right now, and where my life is going. And what does that life look like? Are you going to move back to LA? Maybe. See? You don't even have a plan. Your job is fixing problems of other people, but when it comes to your own problems? You're right. You're right, Lisa. I can't fix my problems. Truth is, I have no idea what I'm doing. And for the first time in my life, I'm okay with that. How can you be okay with that? I ran my life into the ground, trying to fix myself by myself. I'm okay with not being in control because as corny as this may sound to you, I know God's in control. Oh, is that it? You found God now? No, he's been there all along. Now I know I have a father who paid it all to get me, and that's the kind of love I wanna give Sophie. What now, Father? Did I do the right thing? There. Thank you. How do I look? You look like a president. Ha. Ready? Yeah. Okay, be back soon. You got your books and your drawing stuff and Asher will keep you company. I love you. - I love you too. - I love you more. Remember, daddy, don't cry. Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle. He is my steadfast love and fortress. He is my stronghold, my deliverer. He is my shield, and the one in whom I take refuge. Mr. Bauer. Clay. I met her in Wyoming, in a bar. Michelle Howard? Well, her name wasn't Howard then. She was married to somebody else. So, when did Mrs. Howard inform you that she was married? She never did. I found out the next day from a friend. And were you aware that she had two children at that time? No. So how did you find out about Sophie? I got a letter from the state of Utah, saying that I had a little girl and that I owed child support. And what did you do after you received that letter? Drove seven hours, from Bozeman to Salt Lake. First, I needed to know it was real. And if I had a daughter, I wanted to meet her. I saw the kind of world that they were living in. You're a pretty lucky girl to have a daddy like yours. He's a good daddy. I wish we all had good daddys. We all do. You've never been married, never raised children, you're currently unemployed, and you have an unstable history moving from state to state, which suggests that you are totally unpredictable. Objection, speculation. Can you honestly say that you are capable of raising a child? Well it was sad more than anything. He tried so hard to turn her against us. And when I saw that he was having a negative effect on Sophie, I got worried. Mrs. Howard, have any of your husbands ever physically abused you, or any of your children? Nothing worth mentioning. Nothing like what Clay Bauer would like you to believe. Thank you Mrs. Howard, that is all. Your Honor, we wish to call the court Guardian ad Litem, Mr. Roberts to the stand, please. The essence of my job is to investigate the living situation of the minor child. So please tell us the findings of the outcomes of your investigation. Objection. Your Honor, the respondent has not had the opportunity to read Mr. Roberts' report prior to this hearing. I'd suggest you request a copy next time. Please proceed, Mr. Roberts. The daily violence described to me by the minor child, Sophie Bauer, is the worst case I have seen in 15 years of serving as Guardian ad Litem... No way. I'm a good mom. And you all have a problem with that? Mrs. Howard. He's a selfish liar, and he just wants to rip her away from me. Please continue, Mr. Roberts. Along with the findings of 14 domestic violence reports... 14? You only told me of three. Mr. Bauer, I will not have anymore outbursts in this court. Now sit down before I find you in contempt. I believe that the minor child could suffer irreparable harm if she were to remain in her current situation with her mother. Look. I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did. I just want what's best for Sophie. Really? And is that what you wanted for Martina? As we have heard from the Guardian ad Litem, this case is about finding a solution for Sophie Bauer. The petitioner has suggested that Mrs. Howard is incapable of providing this level of security. However, what the Guardian ad Litem failed to disclose is Mr. Bauer's past. Mr. Bauer, have you ever been arrested? Mr. Bauer? Mr. Bauer, have you ever been arrested? Yes. Yes, I have. You were arrested in California at the home of a Mexican drug dealer with six kilos of cocaine and $200,000 in cash. Your girlfriend at the time, Martina Hernandez, later died of a drug overdose and you were nowhere to be find, having fled to Wyoming where you seduced my client and this whole story began. Can you honestly say that you deserve to raise Sophie? No. I don't deserve Sophie. I won't deny it or try to make any excuses. I've made mistakes, and some pretty big ones. But one mistake I don't regret is Sophie. I know God's given me a second chance at life through her, one I don't deserve. And I'll continue to change, because that's what a real father does: gives his very best to his children. And that is what I'll give Sophie. My life was a story I didn't wanna tell. Every mistake, every choice, every failure. I thought it was up to me. I thought it was about me, until I met my daughter and I realized I didn't know how to be a good father. And no matter what I tried, I couldn't fix it. But I've learned that life is about more than second chances alone. Through my story, I've found the Father's love, or he found me. This court finds that it is in the best interest of the minor child to remain in the petitioner's custody full time. Now I could start loving my daughter, because I have been given a whole new life. A whole new hope, and a whole new purpose. I guess I just needed the help of a little girl. Now this is a story worth telling, worth living. The kind of story that changes more than just me. It brings life and hope.
