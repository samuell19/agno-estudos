DANNY (VOICEOVER): It's times like this that I realize life is simply about people, and choices, and, of course, timing. We make decisions all of the time, though understanding when to implement them can change our world totally. As it happens, I've been waiting two years. I've been waiting for the right certificate to pop through my letter box. If that happened today, I'd have two weeks to sort out the rest of my life. [DOORBELL RINGING] -Thanks, mate. Oh, shit. This is it. Yeah, Mr. Rothbottom, please. Yeah, I'll wait. Ah, yes, Mr. Rothbottom. Danny Weatherill here. Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm calling. I have just received my decree absolute. That's right. Now I'm officially divorced, so I'm going to get married again. -Well, you only have two weeks before the terms of your father's will expires, which means you will need to be married by two weeks today, Friday, but you see, we don't think that a same sex marriage is quite the same thing. -Well, it's up to the law, and the law quite clearly says I can commit to the husband of my dreams and it's all legal. -Well, um-- -I'll have the certificate faxed to your office in two weeks. I trust that will be sufficient to release my family heritage back to me. -Well-- -Good. Thanks, Mr. Rothbottom. It's all in hand, and I'll speak to you very soon. Goodbye. Got it. Looking for the man of my dreams. Open to all ages and types. Hey, Florian. Did you get your invite? What do you mean, why didn't I ask you first? As if I would choose you to-- Listen. Even if you hadn't have left me, I wouldn't be using you to select the next man of my dreams. No. Well, yeah. No way. I have 269 messages. I'll call you back. This is gonna take a while. You can meet me tomorrow at Zuna's at 4:00 PM. Oh, wow. Hi guys. Um, thanks for coming. Gotta be organized, right? So, I thought we'd do like five minutes each, kind of speed dating style. When we're done, you're free to leave. Oh. And if you don't mind, I'm gonna make a few notes. I'll let you know in a couple of days what happens next. That OK? Good. Here we go, then. Do you smoke? Are you drunk? Did your grandma knit that for ya? -Yeah. -What, are you n -I'm Billy, and I'm self-employed in sales. I have my own place. I'm single, and I wanna give it a go. -You got it. -Hi. Just wanna be happy with someone. No stress, no lies. Just love. -Well, it's a start. That's it. It's him. Tick. [KNOCKING] Aye. Good to see you again. Come in. Well, um-- this isn't quite what I had in mind. -What, you can't do this without alcohol? -I wouldn't know where to start with something that big, to be honest. -Hi, guys. We're down to the final few. Please arrive tomorrow afternoon, Thursday, by 5:00 PM at Northcoat Manor. Please do bring your close family in case you are a successful applicant. Your family is a requirement to make it all official. You are, of course, invited to the wedding even if you're not the lucky guy. I'm just thinking out loud, but you might not want to tell your family until the last minute what's going on. Disappointment can be hard on us all. Love Danny. DANNY (VOCIEOVER): So, this was it. The last 24 hours to obtain what is rightly mine under my father's will. The opportunity to regain my family heritage. I'd invited a few close friends, no family, and I was looking forward to it. Besides, this part was going to be easy. -Hey, Tracie. -Hey, mister. -Uh, was-- -Oh. I guess I'd better go back and get him. I'll see you later? -Here, sir. -That's your key. -Thank you. -Hello. -Weatherill is the name. Is it a king size bed? -Yes, sir. It is. -I'll be back if it isn't, you know. -That's your key, sir. -Oh, guys, we need the chairs now, please. Ah, are you Danny? There you are. -Pleasure, Gillian. -So you're all set? -Um, I think so. I guess it's all happening. -Yes. Tomorrow, mister and mister Weatherill will be mint marching down the isle. So, where is the lucky man? -Danny. -Good to see ya. -You big tart. -Snot. Very good friends. -Family, darling. Family. -This is Florian, who's had more men than-- anyone on the planet. This is Gillian. We're in capable hands. -Nice to meet you. Here she is. Tracie! -Florian. -Tracie, this is Gillian. -Oh. Best man and fag-- -Family. As you say. Family. -No, no, no. She was right on the button there. -Oh, you are such a brat. -Can I join in? -This is Billy. -So, this is your husband to be? -Maybe. -Congratulations. -This is Willy. And he's getting married in the morning. -You can keep your slippery hands off. -Well, this is going to be interesting. -Well, we'd better get going. So, first thing tomorrow, then. DANNY (VOICEOVER): Get it back on track. Drink always works. Get them tipsy. They won't keep up. -Whoa. No you don't. I'm gonna keep you babies safe. -I missed you, mister. -Did I miss you? I don't think so. Hey, where on Earth's Mikey? -Oh. Mikey's dumped, as of two weeks ago? -Florian, why do you seem to make a habit of just dumping guys at the drop of a hat? -And why are you marrying so quickly? -Cheers, girls. Well, my man of six month's duration ran away three weeks ago, having told me I was definitely the one for him. And searching for five consecutive nights in every conceivable theme bar I could find, I've decided to tie the knot early, to keep him locked in from the beginning. -And why didn't you tell us? I mean, we could have at least-- -Found me some hyped up label lover with more money than sense. He would have dumped me because I only own two pairs of shoes and I don't do drugs. -See what you mean. Tough, isn't it? -Daniel Weatherill. You hunk of a man. There you are. -Charlotte! You've been ignoring me. It's been- are you OK? -Yeah. I'm fine. Sick of traveling, got un-fine. -And where's Paul? Don't tell me he's-- -Well, kind of. He's been away on business again this week, and had to go see his mates at the club to watch the game. But he's coming in the morning. -It's lovely to see you. -Yes. -Right. Introductions. This is Florian. -Who I've heard about on more occasions than I can recall. -And here we have Gregory and-- -Tracie. Nice to meet you. -This is my lovely best woman for the weekend, childhood sweetheart, and-- -Ex-wife. -I give you Charlotte. -So you're divorced, then? -Well, my fiance's coming tomorrow. -And what does he do when he's not throwing darts at the wedding album? -Head of sales at some company or other. -More time for us. -Yes. -To friendships. -Friendships. -Friendships. -Do you have any family coming, Danny? -Well, there's only a couple left, and to be honest, I don't want them here. If they can't accept me, bugger 'em. -Florian is your lifelong best friend? -He didn't actually manage to make it to our wedding. -That's right. For some reason, he decided to up sticks and move to Australia the day before the wedding, if I remember correctly. -Interesting friendship. -Whatever. -Is there some juice? I'd just like a juice. Oh, and where's your man? -We need to talk. You sure you don't need some food, or something? I need to meet people. -You need any help? I thought I might-- -I thought you'd ticked that box and moved on. DANNY (VOICEOVER): The one thing in my plan doesn't account of is other people's choices, nor their timing. Ah, a moment to reflect. -Good to see you. -Oh. Raj. God, time is flying. Good to see you, too. -Raj, now is not the time to talk. We must check in. We're very tired from the long journey. -Ma, this is Danny. Danny, this is my mom, Mrs. Patel. -Oh, Danny. We have heard so much about you. Raj, well, he kept you secret for so long. But now we know the truth. We are so proud. And you. You are very beautiful. Raj, quickly. -You must be Danny. You are so beautiful. We welcome you to our family. When Raj said he wanted to arrange his own marriage, we worried. But now-- now I see. -Billy. Do you have a best woman? You know, for tomorrow? Don't you want someone to organize things for you? Bring you breakfast in bed? -What about your boyfriend? -Greg has a nice car. [PHONE RINGING] -Confetti. If I was getting married in the morning, I'd want confetti. -So, where are the parents? -Well, Danny's-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah. But what about the boys? I mean, his phone keeps ringing. Maybe they're lost? -Oh, please. -What? -Or maybe they're dead, too. Well bugger, that could have worked. I could have him, and you could have his father. -Shut up. I'm not getting with someone that old. -He may be right. -Why is it only ever one thing or the other? -Don't worry. I'll give you marks on his pedigree tomorrow. -Not if I get there first. -Oh. -Billy. Are your parents coming? -No. They're dead. -Oh. -Oh. -Uh-- -Oh, Danny. Where have you been? -Yes, we wondered where you'd got to. Getting the drinks in, I hope? God knows I'll be needing them this weekend. -How did you find out this was going on? -Was the solicitors, wasn't it, darling? He happened to mention it when he called Henry last week. We wouldn't have missed it for the world. -I don't think it's your kind of thing, Aunt Mildred. -Hello. Relatives? -This is Auntie Mildred and Uncle Henry, my late father's brother. -We've come quite a way in the car. -Drinks, then. What would you like? -Something strong. -White wine spritzer, I think, love. -I'll get them. -And you are? -This is Billy. -I'd have preferred it if you were Brittany. -Well, I've got big nipples, if that helps. -Drinks. You think you're going to change anything-- it ain't gonna happen. Be warned. -Sorry. We're eating alone tonight. I've found a place down the road to it. So it's easier. -Nothing. Thanks. I'll let you know in the morning. My decision. -Can I, uh, see you again tonight? You know-- just a last-- -Sure. That'd be great. That'd be really great. I'll come to you before 9:00? [PHONE RINGING] Hey, how are ya? Oh. Double oh. OK. I understand. Getting hitched to someone you only just met is a bit weird. I guess. Well, um, have a good-- yeah. Thanks. -You OK? -Yeah. -You sure? -I'll let you know in the morning, early, if it's you. You still up for this? -You bet. I wanted to change my life. And with you, I can. We're down to the last three, then? -Yeah. That's right. Someone just dropped out, and there's still one left to come. -Do your friends know what's going on? -Do you think they need to know? Life's still enough as it is. They'll stand by me no matter what. -I guess. DANNY (VOICEOVER): I should have cancelled dinner. By that time, I knew the raucous dinner with friends was to become-- well-- dinner with my uncle. -Evening, auntie. -Hello, dear. -Evening. -Hi. -Yeah. -This is a lovely hotel, Danny. We have lovely views from our room. -Yeah. It is my second special day, after all. -Hello, everyone. Danny. -Sorry, madame. -Nice outfit. -Thanks. Shame you couldn't fit into the other half of yours. Do you have the wine list? -I'll be back in a moment, sir. -You OK? What's happened to your name badge? -Shit. It must be stuck to my girlfriend's tits. I gave her a kiss and a hug in the car. -OK. What do you need? -Um-- wine list. -Oh, they're mixed up with the food menus. You giving them out? It's OK. They'll realize. -Hm. Oh. Could I have, possibly, a little glass of-- oh, well-- well, that must have just, um-- slipped somewhere. Lovely. OK. -Can I take your orders? -Uh, yeah. Can I have the beef, please? Thanks. And you're doing a great job, by the way. -And what would you like, sir? -Could you tell me what the lamb comes with? -Um, carrots and broccoli, and new potatoes, and juice. I mean, uh, jew. -Yeah. I'll have that one, please. Thanks. -Hm. I'm really craving a big piece of meat. Do you recommend anything? -The, uh, chicken's good. It comes with, uh, spring vegetables, and, uh-- white wine gravy. -Sure. I'll have that. -The [ITALIAN]. Can you tell me what that is, please? -[ITALIAN]. Uh-- -One of those. -Good man. Thank you. So, Danny, why the middle of winter? Of all the times to get married, why on Earth the middle of winter? -Why not? -So, where's the other groom? -Well, we're staying apart for, you know-- look. -You can tell us. We're all friends here. -There's nothing to tell. -Short notice. And not even an invite to your family? All a bit odd don't you think? -You're here, aren't you? -Uninvited. -What about the honeymoon? Is it a long flight? Oh-- Danny, you're allergic to flying, aren't you? -No. -You know what I mean. -Not a fear of flying. Just long distances, at least. -No, uncle, it's natural. Not odd. -Natural to get married to a woman, yes, but-- -If all you can do is criticize me in front of my-- -Embarrassment? You think you understand embarrassment? -Not sure I can help you there. -You think all these people are here to celebrate? Spectate, more like. -As long as my lovely Danny is happy. -You know, I wondered why all those people were-- -Friends, Tracie. They're just friends. -Oh, mine was the chicken. Sorry. -Well, fluff my cushions. It must be bedtime. Room 219, boys, if any of you want a good time. And Danny, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Don't be late. -Goodnight, dear. -Bye, bye. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Games. -Games? It's getting a bit late, Charlotte. -Oh, come on. It's only 8:30. -Oh, Mr. Weatherill. I have a message for you. From Mr. and Mrs. Patel They said, as you're going to be their future son in law, would you like to spend the evening with them? -Uh, I think you might have the wrong person. What? -That-- that wasn't for me. -Do I see trouble brewing? -It's nothing. My uncle, he's interfering. Nothing that can't be solved. -Well, I would marry Danny again because-- because his heart is softer than a kiss. And for me, I would trust you with my life. Every last breath. -I don't get it. I don't understand why you two could still be married. Why men? -I guess it's an admission. Do you remember the black and white movies? When you watched them, you were kind of with them, but there was something missing? Then along came color. Well, this-- this is like living my life in full 3D color. You know, it would still be you if-- -Hm. Well, after that little revelation flower-- oh, shit. -I need-- I'll come back. -What is going on, mister? -I promised one of the guests I'd go see him before 9:00. -No. I mean, what is going on? -Gotta go. -Come in. -Um, Raj, I-- I don't think it's-- -Don't worry. I'm just relaxing. I don't want to rush anything. But just-- -Raj, I-- I-- -Don't worry. I don't want to rush anything. But I think we should get to know each other a little more. -Sure. -So, do you believe in love? -You are a wonderful guy, Raj. You relax me. I don't know what it is. -Could be love. Though maybe it's too soon for that. Don't worry. It's my clock. It makes that noise. So, why so quick? -Why not? Why not? We could spend two or three years checking if we're OK for each other, and we'll never know until we try it. Only in the cold, harsh light of living together in partnership does anyone truly get to learn who we are. -What would it take? You can tell me your secret. I won't mind. I'm not worried about the past. I just look forward to our future. -Sometimes we do things because we think we have to. We decide in the heat of the moment. -And that's how a partnership works. We bring balance to each other. And love. To brighten the dark moment. -So, how come your parents are OK with this? -Because love can happen in all shapes and sizes. You shall live this life together. Rest on it. And when you come back, my son will be even more handsome. And you-- you shall come back as his beautiful female bride. -Good evening. I have a room booked. My name is Richard Senior. -Certainly, sir. Just sign here. -Thank you. Could you please tell me where I can find Danny Weatherill? -Yes, sir. I think they are all in the drawing room. Just upstairs. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -I'm sorry. I'm looking for Danny. Is he around, do you know? -Uh, he'll be back. -Are you here for the wedding? -Yes, I am. -Which side? Danny or Billy? -Well, actually I-- -Oh. Ah, good to see ya. Glad you made it. Uh, do you want to go up to your room, and I'll catch up with you a bit later? -Yes. Yes, of course. I'll leave you to your, um-- yes. -OK. What the hell's going on? -Whoa. -Look. This is really hard. -But I never thought you would be one for money. Or that many men, even. -Listen, Florian. It's OK for you. With everything you ever had, or wanted, around you. I have nothing. None of my childhood toys. No photographs that are not easily identifiable. The gramophone my mother promised me. My grandmother's teddy bear. The pipe stand I made for my father when I was 10. And yes, the house with the sea view. And there was some money. But you need to understand that almost anything other than my memories have b locked up for over two years because of his will. And all right, yeah, maybe-- maybe it's not the most honorable of things to do at short notice. But can't you see why? Why should I live without what's left of my family history just to see it go to some soddy charity, or wprse? My uncle, in less 24 hours if I don't get hitched. How the hell would you feel? Oh-- and love? What about the guy? Yeah, right. I have no problem. All three of them are really lovely. I can't even make a choice. -How can you marry someone you've only just met. Why not? You've sucked the cocks of hundreds of men you hadn't yet met. -Oh, who would want to marry you so quickly, anyway? I mean, you know, who does that? -Someone like me, I guess, Tracie. Someone like me, you know. -TRACIE: Right. -That's it. Here's what we're going to do. Two groups. We draw up questions, we interview each of them, then we score them. Then the winner takes it all. Now, Danny-- -That is a great idea. We can all get to know them more intimately. -No way. -Why not? -Because I already-- -And you can't decide. Besides, this might throw up some more hidden secrets. -It's settled, then. Two groups. -No. No, I'm going to be a contestant. -Charlotte-- -I want another chance. -Right. I will do one assessment. Tracie, Gregory, you can do the other. And when we're done, Danny can have a one on one with each of them. We'll meet back here in the 90 minutes with our summaries. Tracie, let's go and do it in our rooms. We'll get the boys. [CLANGING] -You're welcome to join us. -Uh, no-- -Please do. No. -This is part of our ritual. The groom must ride into his ceremony on a strong stallion. And then we wait for the most auspicious moment to arrive. -I just need him for a little while, Mr. Patel. I'll bring him right back. -But he mustn't leave! -It's part of our ritual. He won't be long. -No. I'm not do-- I just want to cancel my subscription. I'm not doing this kind of thing anymore. Hey. -Hey. Um, we have-- Danny has asked if we can do some questions. His friends. Just to help him decide. Oh, don't worry. You're one of three. Oh, and you don't need to get dressed. Just come as you are. We're gonna change rooms. -Whatever. -So, it is just a few questions. Are you definitely gay? -Yes. Well-- -Right. Nothing. So, could be. Now it's your turn. You need to check. -Yeah. He's gay. -How gay? -Very gay! -How big is he? -Big. -Little big, or big big? -Tracie. He's big. [KNOCKING] -It's open. Ah. Welcome to my boudoir. -Tongues will wag, you know? -Something tells me that's not the only thing. -Are you sure you know what you're doing? Oh, god. You've planned yourself to death. -Yeah. A lifetime in project management does that to you. Just imagine what my first date was like. -Do you mind if I ask a question? Not at all. -Is this just a flash in the pan, or are you thinking long term? -This is about growing together. The road is always rough, and you probably have the most experience of all on how to deal with it. -Hm? Ah. But the best way to learn is by doing. -And how about you? Are you ready for this? -As long as everyone knows what they're getting into. Hm? Why now? -We don't always have the choices we'd like. Rest assured, there's nothing underhand here, though I agree it is all a bit rushed. -Well, I hope they've got good supplies. I'm gonna need this. So, when do we find out for sure? -Tomorrow. -Mm. There's going to be broken hearts to contend with. I hope you're prepared. -Favorite food. -Home cooking. What? Anyone's home cooking. It doesn't matter. -And finally, what does love mean to you? -It's for the rest of your life. It's honesty, tolerance-- and understanding. -So you think it's important, then? -So, how many men have you been with? -Does it matter? -Yes. How many? I would think so-- 300 to 500? 500 to 1,000? -I always was a star pupil. -500 to 1,000. Busy boy. Right. How big are you? -What? God. Does it matter? Happy? -Satisfactory. Smooth or hair? Smooth. Big dick. And what you do for a job? -Sales. -In what? -Clothes. Fashion. Big brands at a discount. Nothing flash. -And which of the big brands do not take part in aspirational sizing? -What? -Which of the brands do not lie to their customers about the real size of their heft? I'd have picked-- you'd have to answer the question. I was just joking, yeah. Uh-- why Danny? Why now? -As you go through life, it changes. We discover we've taken different paths. Sometimes without even knowing it. This is a decision to change. And Danny-- he is the sweetest guy I've ever met. He's open, he's honest. And he's really cute. -Thank you. -How can I help you? -Are you definitely gay? -Yes. -How do you know? -Because I've been me all my life. -I need more evidence. -Excuse me, young lady. You probably can't afford what you're about to do. -So, evidence. -Oh, god. Look. I don't do nipples. Or breasts. My tongue has never been near a clitoris. And apart from a very quick grope behind the bike sheds forty years ago after a bottle of cider at the school disco, I've never been there. -That's all we needed to know. Um-- how big-- -How big are you? -I've never had any complaints. -Never? -Not one. -Favorite food? -What? Nothing with chopsticks. All effort, and no payback. I'd say French cuisine. Or that sauce. -And what does love mean to you? -A damn sight more t it ever has to your generation, young lady. I can assure you of that. Well, until recently. I suppose I've changed my mind. But once you realize that it's about the person, and not about yourself, you understand. And it's the most wonderful thing that you can ever find. Though, of course, there are many different kinds of love. -But do you-- -You have your answer. -Sorry, wrong room. Uh, sorry, wrong room. -Oh! Jimmy. Hard at it, I see. -Wow. Glad I was sitting down for that. -Good evening. -So why is it you think you're right for Danny this time? You know, after messing up already. -It's not that it was wrong last time. I guess-- I guess we just could jump to a conclusion without really thinking. -Do you think that it would work with another woman? What would need to change? -Irrespective of the complications others might see, it's really not that difficult. -And how would you get over the physical challenges? -When Danny loves someone, it never stops. If he opened his heart, he'd find the right answer. -Guess we're done here, then. -I guess so. -Where have you been? -Drinking. -Why? -Have you got a problem with that? -Come and sit down, love. We've got the results. -Why does Charlotte only have a score of 15? -No cock. -You're telling me at midnight, the day before my big day, you've dragged everyone through god knows what to draw the conclusion that everyone is the same, apart from Charlotte? Great. -Look, it's a really difficult decision, Danny. You found some really hot-- um, I mean great guys. -Have at it. I'm going to bed. Everybody out. -But-- -Listen, guys. I'm really grateful. I am. But I'm interested in who someone is, not what they are. -Que? -And you. You need to realize this is not about how big someone is, or the clothes they wear, or how old they are. That's all transient stuff that changes. Thanks for everything. But I'm really tired, and really-- -You're really doing the right thing, Danny. Don't doubt yourself. Not now. [KNOCKING] -Good morning. Looks like you're expecting me. -Hi, Tracie. -So how you doing? Come on, mister. You need your energy. Confused, huh? -Undecided. Perhaps confused. No? -You need some help? -Which one would you pick? -See? You are confused. Here. Let me. -This isn't helping. -But it would be easier, right? I mean, if it were love-- -Tracie. I'm not sure you're one to advise on love. -Really? -Well, you have a boyfriend. In fact, you have a great boyfriend. Yet you-- -Are undecided? [KNOCKING] I'll get it. -So, what do you really think about love? -It depends if you're talking about family love, friendly love, or being in love. Being in love. It's a wonderful thing-- if you can find it. You can't buy it, that's for sure. -Hm. Does it really know no bounds? -When it's true, it lasts forever. And the situations are of it. -Oh, wow. His name is Zach. Wow. Billy is a rent boy. -Bloody hell. -Is that Florian's handwriting? -It is. Why does he always-- dammit. -It's all a game, Danny. So do you love him yet? -Tracie, that is not helpful. -I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- -It's OK. Someone else hired him behind the facade of-- -Fantasy and indecision? -Tracie, what is it you want? Honestly. -Mr. Wonderful. Mr. Honesty. Mister-- -Me, too. And you have that already. -Yeah, I'm not so sure. -Tracie, it's not me. -I know. -I need to think differently this time. -You sure on that? -You should give him a chance. -Are you nervous? -You never really know what's waiting around the corner. -No. But odds are I can have a bloody good guess. -No, you can't. I can see happiness all the way to the horizon. -So, once the panic of excitement is over, you'll still be here? You don't think he's too young? -He knows exactly what he's doing. -I feel as if I'm going to be part of some live freak show. -That makes both of us. -Come on. I'm bloody starving. -Well, this is it, babe. -Would you do it again? -In an instant. -Prepare yourself. I mean it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The congregation may sit. Welcome to the commitment ceremony for Danny-- [GROANING] -Henry. Are you all right, dear? -Should I call the morgue to make a reservation now? -He lives. -Trop wind. A little bit too much scotch, probably. -Welcome to the commitment ceremony for Danny and-- -Welcome to the commitment ceremony for-- for Danny, and-- for Danny and Richard. [APPLAUSE] -I don't understand. What is happening? We came a long way to see our son be married. We brought the whole family. With luggage. -And who the hell is he, anyway? -He is my father. -What? -He's my father. He adopted me two years ago. Well, he helped. And paid for my rehab in the drug clinic. The family had disowned me. -What about the, um, the Indian? -What about the Indian? -Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He's-- he's gorgeous. -Yes. He's very handsome. -And very lonely. I just want to be loved. Not just family love. But true love. When I got your message on the internet-- -You got me to buy your webcam to date over the internet? -A lot of people make love over the internet these days. It's faster and cheaper. Now let him finish. -I thought that now might be my time. -I-- he bet me. He bet me that you wouldn't marry me. I wondered what might happen next. For everyone. I've learned that a policy of no surprises is always best. -You're open. -Honest. Accepting. And I like your approach. I don't think you knew what you were looking for. But I don't think that matters. -Oh, he knows what he's looking for, all right. And I bet you'd all like to know just how honest he is. Well, I'll tell you. He's doing this for money. Not love, but money. -That's not true. -Oh, yes it is. He received his divorce papers one week ago, and now he's trying to claim money from his late father's estate by getting, well, committing to someone before midday today. I have the proof here in my hands. Money is why he's here. -No it's not. I have found-- -Did you or did you not start this process to get your hands on your late father's estate? -Yes, I did. And you don't have an interest, of course. The right question is, what would happen to it if I didn't get it? -I'm not taking any more of this charade. -I need a drink. -Ladies and gentlemen, please. -I wonder if the others are leaving. -What do you expect? -More heart. -He can't get remarried like that. Anyway, if he doesn't do it before 12:00, we get the inheritance. Well, the half that doesn't go to charity, that is. -You would take money from-- -It's not right. It's not what David wanted. He never would've allowed-- -Oh, you think that's right, do you? -He was my brother. Of course I-- -We are not your brother, and you need to find your humanity. -Where are you going? -To see my nephew. [KNOCKING] -It's open. -Danny, you can still do this. -No I can't. I cocked up again. -No you didn't. Just because one of your relatives has got his head screwed on backwards. Still hurts. -What does your heart tell you? -That I made the wrong decision. -No you didn't. -I made a wrong decision. -Danny. -I still love you. -And I love you. OK? I always will. But we don't need to be married for that to happen. What does your heart tell you? You can't plan yourself through a relationship, Danny. It's not as easy as seeing a destination and merely tracking a course to it. What do you feel in your heart? -The last time I listened to my heart, I hurt someone. -That was just part of your journey. What do you feel? Danny, you're thinking. What do you feel? -That someone in that room is for me. -So, are you gonna follow your heart and do something about it? -It's too late. -Danny! Danny, don't! It's never too late for love, OK? I got you. Come here. Get yourself together. We can do this. I'll get everyone. Do you have a gong. -A gong? -Yeah, you know, like, um-- like a bell or something? Thanks! It's back on. You must come and see. But it's true love. Raj. What if this really was your time? You wouldn't wanna miss it, would you? -What's it to be, boys and girls? I think we should get started. No, I don't think so. Don't worry about that, son. It'll mix as it goes down. -It's back on! Come on. It's back on! -No, I don't think so. -Why not? -Fill her up. -Ah. You think you've won the bet already. Best of three. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Nearly 12:00. Maybe it won't be me. I think I'm very lucky I have a loving family. I'm not sure they understand, but they do love me. -Welcome to the commitment ceremony for Danny and-- -I've got something to say. No, no, please. Let me finish. What I hadn't quite appreciated is that, all of you are a-- a family, with real feelings, and real hearts. Your father and I had never considered this as a legitimate way of life. Yet, the evidence is clear to me now. It's overwhelming, and I'm very proud. And I'm very sorry. -Welcome to the commitment ceremony for-- for Danny and-- for Danny and Raj. [CHEERING] -Ladies and gentlemen, I-- I'm-- I'm sorry. Is this not Robert Smith? I can only conduct a civil ceremony for yourself and your partner Robert Smith. -When I applied, I was with a Robert Smith, but he's left me, so now it's Raj Patel. -I'm sorry. -Robert Smith dumped me, and I didn't know until-- -I'm so sorry. I just can't change the names like that. -Danny. Do you want to commit to me, for better and worse, from now, for all eternity? -Yes. Yes, I do. -I'm sorry. I know you tried to have a ceremony on the date. However, the will cannot be changed. The certificate is valid, though it is dated three weeks past the explanation of the will. However, your uncle has agreed to pass all of his share to you, including the family heirlooms, though I'm afraid the other half has already been passed to the specified charity. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Surprise! -You guys look amazing. -Florian. You're the best friend I've had. [MUSIC PLAYING]
