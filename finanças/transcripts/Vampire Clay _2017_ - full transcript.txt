________________________________________“New classroom” Kaori will be back tomorrow. That's too bad. “Art school entrance exams” “Art school entrance exams” She studied hard in Tokyo. Don't fall behind. We lost time because of the move. Hello. Kaori! What a coincidence. We were just talking about you. I thought I'd drop off my stuff today. Hi, you guys. Long time no see. Welcome back. How was the workshop? I learned a lot. I'll fill you in later. Reiko. My shoes? Leave them on. You're all sweaty. Did you come on your bike? Yes. That hill is a killer. This building is pretty old. Hey... Oil paints? Yes. This place used to be a sculptor's studio. He left things behind. Now it's our classroom. Are the students in Tokyo really good? Not like us in the countryside? Yeah but only a handful are really talented. But planes and dimensions reflect the artists' aesthetics. Some people are naturally gifted. The works by students in major prep courses are so amazing. I was impressed by how much money they spend on the motifs. The paintings were powerful. Class has already started. You can ask her later. About Tokyo. Yes, ma'am. Excuse me. Grime. Oh yeah. I got these at a shrine. For you. Thanks. And you. “Good luck amulet” “Good luck amulet” “Good luck amulet” “Good luck amulet” My hands are dirty. Leave it there. Ms. Aina, may I start today? Of course. Thank you. Can I sit here? _________“Kaori” What? Yuka is using your clay. I'm Yuka. I just joined the class. I didn't have any clay so... I told her she could use yours. No problem. I'll find another batch. Thank you. Find some? Yeah. “Make a turban shell on a platform” This clay feels kind of different. Hard to mold? Whose was it? Not hard to mold. Just somehow different. You've gotten good. Much better than before. “Clay Sculpting Week” Ten more minutes. “4th place” ___________________________“3rd place” “Top prize” “2nd place” There. Your rankings. Reiko gets the top prize but Kaori has the same score. Reiko, yours was good but similar to one of your previous works. I know you're getting nervous about the exams. But don't turn to conventional designs. Stay true to your own style. Next time, be more playful. Don't worry. You have the skills. The model is a vase of like 200 flowers. Can you believe it? The quantity alone makes the drawings more powerful. Who didn't return it? Oh, me. I'm sorry. I'm good with flowers so I thought I'd be in the top 10. I overestimated myself. There are so many students. I got 30th place. Yeah... You may be the best here but you're probably #100 nationwide. I think I'm better than that. But I thought we're actually just as good. Nobody can construct planes like Aiko. We'll start at 9:30. Good morning. You're late. I told you to be here at nine. Sorry. The mirror's here. Good morning. Good morning. Ouch. “Make a head sculpture of yourself with any facial expression” Are the students in Tokyo really good? Do we measure up? Can we beat them? Who thinks your current skills will get you into an art school? Nobody? You see reality as it is. You'll all fail. You want to come back here next year? Repeat the same projects? No higher aspirations? You're up against a lot of competition. I'll evaluate your works at noon tomorrow. They're hopeless at the moment. Lock up after yourselves. Don't stay past nine. I'm leaving soon. I'm in a hurry. Reiko, see you tomorrow. Bye. You fed it before you left. Yes. Did you close the door? I thought I did. What happened? This is awful. You should tell Ms. Aina. You don't deserve this. It's okay. I'm fine. I'm definitely more motivated now. They're better now. Kaori gets the top prize and that's it. Aiko, Kanji, Reiko. Yours won't get you into art school. Look at Yuka's sculpture. She's a beginner and isn't very good yet. But the judges may choose this for its novelty. The rest are all mediocre. What should I do? What? How can I improve? Study fine works of art and practice as much as possible. What kind of fine works? Like this sculpture by Kaori and previous works by Reiko. Also by my former students. That won't help. Well, I only have four former students... It's better to search online. It's a fact. We live in the countryside. There are only five of us. Remember yesterday? You said there's a lot of competition. We have to check them out. Make it protrude more. Ms. Aina. Is the quality of classes in Tokyo that much better? The answer is clear. Kaori studied in Tokyo. I think it was the clay. I started this course after Kaori but I thought I was just as good as her. But it's apparent now. Tokyo made the difference. Kaori has definitely improved her skills. But will going to Tokyo do that for everybody? Students there don't get as much attention... Ms. Aina, I think the clay I used was unusual. Wait. I believe an artist's basic training is what matters in the end. Regardless where you're from, with solid basic skills and strong determination, you'll pass the exam. If the choice comes down to two people it's their style that gets judged. Students in big courses have more sources of inspiration which gives them an advantage. “Aina” “Aina Academy _New students wanted” Can't you invite an instructor from Tokyo once a month? You're all we have. If we can learn from other instructors... If you have time to complain use it for more practice projects. Move your hands if you want to improve. I know how you feel but work with what you have. Earthquake! Are you guys okay? You're right. I get it. Let me think about it. I disagree. I don't want to lose my individuality to convention. The countryside has its advantages. So I'm fine as we are. I'll lock up again tonight. I disagree. What's happening?! Someone, help me! Help! It's hot! What? I... How could Reiko do this? This is too much. I know she doesn't like me. No... But wrecking my sculpture? I was alone last night... Putting a blade in the clay... Blade? Are you serious? I didn't do that. Sure, I was jealous of you. But I wouldn't do anything like that. Last night after you all left, the clay started moving. Your sculpture started moving... What's the use of harassing me? You may not believe me but I'm telling you the truth! I can't get through to her. Maybe she's home. I got her answering machine. Her mom's also gone. Who are you talking about? I hope she's okay. Good morning. What's up? Is there a problem? I'm going to Reiko's house. Will you clean this place up? You're talking about me? Wait! Ms Aina! Wait! Ms. Aina! Hey! Hold on! Wait! What is it? What happened? Someone! Kaori! I'm right here! No! Why do we have to clean up after her? She's too proud. Look at the trouble she made. I wish she'd quit. Reiko is desperate to please her parents. We're all desperate. We're classmates but in the end, we're also enemies. Come on... I want us all to get accepted. It's such a small prep class. I made you a boxed lunch. Oh... But I bought one today. Sorry. I have to wash up. Reiko! We were all worried about you. I'll help you look. It's all right. Keep working. Yuka's not back yet? Yuka, where were you? Come back inside. Sorry. Where were you? Your cell phone was ringing. Reiko? The art supply shop. Okay. Thanks. You okay? You made lunch for me today, right? You promised. Isn't that your bag? You shouldn't leave it there. Although no one will steal it. I'm going inside before they get suspicious. I'm looking forward to lunch. Lunch? You brought yours, right? Not today. I'll go with you. Okay. Is this the lunch you made me? It'll get dirty on the floor. Thanks. So sweet of you. Let's eat together over there. We're alone now. Let's eat. Ew. What's this? It must've gone bad because you left it outside. It tastes like clay. Ow! I was kidding. It doesn't taste that bad. What are you doing? Hey... Good morning, Reiko. Oops. What happened? I'll go get something. Thanks. What? Aiko? Where are you? Watch out! Kanji's acting weird! He's over there! What happened? What? Kanji? What's going on? Help! What are you doing?! No, Kanji! Stop! Come here! Move! Get up! Hurry! Mitazuka was a struggling sculptor. During the day, he worked at an industrial waste factory and made sculptures at night. He exhibited his works at art galleries in Tokyo but they received poor reviews. He didn't have good social skills and started having problems with the gallery owners. His bad reputation grew in the industry and people became wary of him. One day, he ran into a classmate from his art school prep class. The man had given up art years earlier and had become a huge success in the restaurant business. Fascinating. They're great. There are many restaurants and boutiques that'd love them. They'll definitely sell. Why don't you make them yourself? I can't. I haven't touched clay in close to 20 years. Plus, I don't have the talent. I'll ask around as soon as I get back. In any case you should go see a dermatologist. “Tokyo, here I come. I'm going to make it big.” After that, Mitazuka started making sculptures like crazy. But they didn't attract any buyers. Then one day Mitazuka became ill for unknown reasons. It was probably because of illegal chemical waste products. When he realized he was dying, he made his final sculpture. A humanoid statue, which he named Kakame. Kakame, you're going to Tokyo in my place. You're my alter ego. 326A 00492521/00492705 My child. I'm going to die but you'll live. You'll stay alive forever. Even after my physical death, I'll stay alive in you. And the world will come to praise me. You'll keep living. I'll be Minoru Mitazuka, the famous sculptor. The world will praise the man who created art here. 50,000 yen? Take this for now. You've got to be kidding. What happened to the profits? I want the money! Actually, people had bought his sculptures. The man had cheated him and used the money to pay off his debt. His business had been deteriorating for few years and he was knee deep in debt. I'm doing the best I can. I just need a little time. I'll pay you soon. Soon? That's too late. I don't have time. Let go of me! Get your hands off me! Ouch! Bastard! Mitazuka! Mitazuka! Hey! Mitazuka... 2015a 00513714/00513902 ＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿“Police” Mitazuka's disease had eaten away at his bones. They turned to powder. Hot! The man returned from time to time to pay his respects to the deceased with his favorite drink. Nobody even remembered Mitazuka's existence. Until this moment today. That story... You made it up. Clay? Integrates into human bones and attacks people? Why? We were just studying to get into art school. So why? Why did this happen? I'm going to the police. I want all of this to end. It's my fault. If I hadn't dug up the bag... Let's go to the police. We'll tell them everything. It's the last batch. I'll finish up. You two, get ready. Kaori, please lock up. We're ready to go. Okay. So am I. Where's Kaori? Kaori? No... Kaori! Kaori... Why? We were gonna go to school together in Tokyo. Why? Why? No! Open it. Move. It's all your fault for killing Mr. Mitazuka. It's why everybody is dead. You killed all my friends. Ms. Aina! Leave the kids alone. That's enough. Mitazuka... “Tokyo Academy of Arts” “Modeling clay” “Many successful applicants” “23 applicants accepted into Tokyo Art College” Our next story. The police announced today that DNA analysis revealed the identity of the male corpse found in Yamaoka prefecture at Aina Academy, a prep school for the arts as a local man named Kyozo Fushimi, age 58. The police suspect that Fushimi was involved in some sort of foul play at the academy and are currently searching the whereabouts of the academy's director and five students. It's concrete. Someone was here first. Just dump the stuff already. Let me know if anyone shows up.
