Funding for this restoration provided by DER HUND VON BASKERVILLE was produced by Erda-Film GmbH and released on 28 August 1929. The original length of the film was eight reels (2,382 meters). This restoration is based on the only known surviving materials, an incomplete 35mm nitrate print with Czech titles preserved in the Polish archive in Warsaw, and an incomplete 9.5mm copy with French intertitles in the collection of Seeber FILM Verlag. New titles and intertitles have been recreated based on German censorship records. Portions of reels 2 and 3 remain lost. The missing section has been bridged using photos from the Deutsches Filminstitut, and supplemented with text from the censorship records and a draft of the script. The restoration was completed in 2018 as a partnership between Filmoteka Narodowa- Instytutem Audiowizualnym and the San Francisco Silent Film Festival.

Klaren Cinematography Frederik Fuglsang Producers G. Knauerand H. Schiller Distributed by Südfilm A.G. On the Devonshire moor, the ancient legend of a spectral hound still haunts the Baskerville family... Sir Charles Baskerville, master of Baskerville Hall, believes in the legend more than he cares to admit. Alexander Murski Dr Mortimer, Sir Charles' physician and his closest friend. Jaro Fürth Barrymore, Sir Charles' servant for many years. Valy Arnheim ''Dreadful! The terrible howling.'' ''The hound!'' ''Frankland, you are being foolish. Surely you can't believe in ghosts.'' ''Then how do you explain the unnatural Baskerville deaths on the moor? ''Change the subject. You are upsetting our host.'' ''That is no hound, Frankland. When it storms, the moor sometimes produces these strange sounds.'' ''l come with an urgent message for Sir Charles.'' ''Sir, a man from the village has a message for you.'' Please --- As you are a gentleman, come quickly- l am in danger - Laura Lyons Sherlock Holmes, the genial detective. Carlyle Blackwell Dr Watson, his friend and confidant. George Seroff SIR CHARLES BASKERVILLE'S SUDDEN DEATH REMAINS A MYSTERY ''You come about Sir Charles.'' ''My friend, Dr. Watson - '' ''We waited for Sir Charles' return, while the unnatural howling went on.'' ''l am concerned about Sir Charles. He should have returned by now.'' ''We must fïnd him at once - '' ''With torches we searched the moor...'' ''Like the other Baskerville victims. The same horrible expression on his face!'' ''And there beside the dead man, l saw- the footprints of a gigantic hound!'' ''Supernatural dogs do not leave footprints.'' ''Nor does Sir Henry believe in the hound.

Livio Pavanelli As you value your life keep away from the moor ''Ghosts do not write letters.'' ''Surely, Sir Henry, you cannot object to Mr. Holmes taking your case now.'' ''Unfortunately, I cannot leave London now. But if Dr. Watson will undertake it, there is no better man to have at your side.'' Holmes sends Watson to Baskerville Hall to look after Sir Henry and send back reports. Baskerville Hall proves more ominous than ever. An escaped convict is hiding somewhere on the nearby moor. And the Hall's long time servants, Barrymore and his wife, seem nervous and overwrought... ...even though Sir Henry generously gives Barrymore a set of castoff clothing. When visiting the scene of Sir Charles' death on the moor, Watson and Sir Henry encounter a frightened young woman named Beryl Stapleton. Sir Henry is attracted to the frightened young woman who warns him of unseen dangers. This stirs jealousy in her moody guardian, the butterfly collector Jack Stapleton, who has chanced upon them. That evening, Sir Henry hosts a dinner party, where feelings between he and Beryl grow warmer. Dinner guests notice Stapleton's barely concealed displeasure. That night, a gloved hand emerges to steal one of Sir Henry's shoes. And as Watson tries to read himself to sleep, he hears creaking sounds... End Acts 2 & 3 The morning brought another mystery... ''My shoe cannot have walked off by itself!'' ''Where is Sir Henry?'' ''Walking on the moor.'' ''Beryl, l feel that you are hiding something about your relationship with Mr. Stapleton -'' ''I can only say that he took me in when I was a child. And that I am forever indebted to him.'' ''Then you are not hiding anything from me?'' ''l forbid you to pursue Beryl with these intrusions!'' ''Forgive me if l have been irrational. Put it down to my devotion to Beryl.'' ''Sir Henry, we must all become better acquainted. Please visit us tonight. Perhaps around ten o'clock.'' ''Thank God l found you! You promised me you would not go out alone.'' ''My dear doctor, surely you understand there are times when you are in the way.'' ''Of course. But be careful, Sir Henry. You are in danger!'' ''The light has disappeared!'' End Act 4 ''Please understand why I have come, Sir Henry.'' ''l need to escort you to our cottage. You do not know the moor and will lose your way in the dark.'' ''Good evening, my dear Watson.'' ''Your cigarette brand has betrayed you.'' ''Did you recognize me on the tor?'' ''But l failed to keep my hiding place from you.'' ''The nets are closing in on him. With your help, he will be at my mercy.'' ''Sir Henry's shoe is the final link. I found it in our quarry's home.'' ''But who, Holmes?'' ''A devil in human form - it is - '' ''Why did l not strike sooner?'' ''lt is not Sir Henry!'' ''But it is the suit Sir Henry wore in London.'' ''The murderer will be here soon.'' ''Sir Henry- ?'' ''No. The escaped convict. Sir Henry's clothes have been the poor devil's death.'' ''We were to meet Sir Henry at 10 o'clock. When l heard the frightful howl, I grew concerned.'' ''This is no sight for a young woman.'' ''I gave my castoff wardrobe to Barrymore.'' ''Where is the suit Sir Henry gave you?'' ''You will not find it in the wardrobe - !'' ''Why is the fugitive wearing it?'' ''He is my wife's brother. For us he was no monster, only an unhappy soul. We could not betray him.'' End Act 5 ''The hound took the scent from your shoe, and your coat led the beast to the convict.'' ''You must promise me, Sir Henry, that you will not leave the manor without my permission.'' No one suspected that Stapleton had a confederate in this deadly affair - Laura Lyons. Carla Bartheel ''What do these tickets mean?'' ''You swore you were leaving Beryl, you villain - !'' ''This is my reward for helping you? For driving old Baskerville to his death with my note? I want no more part of this!'' I was the one who decoyed Sir Charles onto the moor. His murderer is - Get an arrest warrant for Miss Laura Lyons. Sherlock Holmes ''This is like Holmes!'' ''How long do you intend to keep me here?'' ''First you will telephone Sir Henry!'' ''Miss Beryl would like to speak with Sir Henry- - '' ''Help! Help!'' ''Thank you my dear. Sir Henry will soon be on the moor!'' End Act 6 ''Sir Henry! Quickly man! Give me your coat!'' ''Had I not taken your coat, you would be the one laying dead on the moor.'' ''The hound will haunt the Baskervilles no more. It was a savage mastiff with phosphorus painted on its jaws.'' ''Stapleton exploited the legend for his own ends - He wanted to eliminate the last living Baskerville for the estate - We now know Stapleton himself was a Baskerville!'' ''I have the arrest warrant for Laura Lyons.'' ''My dear fellow. You were fooled by this clumsy forgery? That is not my writing.'' ''And a final request, Sir Henry. In need a new cravat!'' End
