-Yes! -Yeah! Come on, Moses. You spend a lot of time with books. Thank you. I don't think my nose is that big. Moses, Freya, we are going on a double date tomorrow. And don't be late. Sure. Can you go to the mall with me later, Adrian? I need to buy some clothes for our date tomorrow. I have nothing to wear. Sure. How about helping me get a new boyfriend? Moses... Let's go to Car Free Day on Sunday. I have to give private math lessons at Kanya's every Sunday. How about Sunday evening? Let's go on a culinary tour. There is a new chocolate shop. They sell delicious chocolate. I want to try it. I have English lessons on Sunday evening. Why do we have to go all the way just for chocolate? Do you want to stay here? Or do you want to go to class? I will go to class later. Okay. -I'm leaving. -Alright. You seem okay having relationship with a refrigerator. He is cold. -What are you talking about, Erik? -That's a fact. Hello. Hello, Moses. What is it? What's so important that you had to call me many times? Can you do me a favor? We have been friends for so long. Don't be too formal with me. I am still at my class and I don't think it is going to end soon. Can you pick up Freya before going to the cafe? I have to pick up Gia. I called Gia. She is going to be late too. She is still stuck at the painting studio. Just go with Freya first and I will pick up Gia, okay? Is Freya okay with me picking her up? I need you to help me, Adrian. Alright. I'll leave her to you. Thank you, Adrian. Sure. Freya. Freya. Freya. Hey. Adrian? Gia is still at the studio and Moses at his course. He called me to pick you up. Hello? I am talking to you. Yes... Rather than waiting for Moses, just go with me. -I... -If it is fine with you. -Okay? -Okay. -Okay? -Okay. Let's go. Freya. Are you leaving now? Dad? I gotta go, Dad. Okay. Don't come home too late. Okay, Dad. We're leaving, Sir. Do you also like Greenday? Which songs do you like? I like the old ones. From the album Kerplunk. Kerplunk? That is a very old album. Well, when I was a kid, I listen to Greenday with my cousin. I like the songs because I used to it. I see. 'Cause I want to be the minority I don't need your authority Down with the moral majority 'Cause I want to be the minority Finally... Finally, there is a girl who has the same music taste with me. You are the first girl I know who likes Greenday. I can't do this with Gia. I can't play the songs, let alone sing along. You are quite fun. Sorry. Hello, Gia. Where are you? I'm at the cafe with Freya. Why do you play tricks like that, Honey? Hasn't Moses come yet? I don't know. He is not picking up his phone. He is probably driving. Probably. You... Have you waited long? Good evening, Everyone. Hi, Mongol! Let's give a round of applause! Thank you. Everyone is happy today. There's a guy sitting alone. I am also alone. Our principle is that single doesn't mean gay. Don't worry. But in front of me, I see something absurd. Two girls with one guy. It is normally two guys with one girl right now in our country. It is "my husband has a husband". But here, we have two girls with one guy. Who's dating who? Are you the third wheel? You are beautiful, why just become a third wheel? Why don't we go out together? I am the highest-paid comic. But I am sorry, I am not looking for a relationship this year... ...since our cost of living is high. Girls do not like to go to cheap malls. Single is better. I am sorry. Thank you. -Adrian. -Mom! Wait, Mom. -Adrian... -I am not dressed yet. You think I have never seen you naked? Don't you remember who used to give you shower? Change your clothes? It was when I was a baby. I have hair all over my body now. What is it, Mom? What are you doing tomorrow? I have no plans. Then we will have dinner tomorrow. "We"? Yes. You, me, and Dad. It's been a while since we had dinner together. I forgot. I have plans with Gia tomorrow. I am sorry. Adrian... When will you start talking to your dad? Hey. Make up with your dad already. I am sleepy, Mom. -But, Adrian... -I want to go to bed, Mom. Good night. Good night. Thank you. Freya... Are you still upset? If you did not want come, you should have just said so. It's not like that. I wanted to. But the class was so important and I could not skip it. Okay. Freya... You know I have to study hard to get into medical school. I have to plan my future. I have to work hard to realize my goals and dreams. I get it. But while you are planning your future, you should enjoy your youth which will never come back. Nevermind. I don't want to fight. Just forget it. Are you hungry? Let's make some noodle soup. Adrian said that you are quite fun. He called me this morning and said, "You're girlfriend is quite fun." "She is the only girl I know who also listens to Greenday." "She is fun to have a chat with, unlike the others said." I am weird though. Freya... Don't say that. You always underestimate yourself. Don't do that, okay? I really care for you, Freya. What are you guys cooking? Noodles, Dad... Sir... Noodle soup. Dad. Do you want noodle soup? Yes, I think I am hungry. Okay, I will make it with Moses. Yes, Sir, I will make it for you. I have to wear the best dress. I have to be the most stunning at Sheila's party tomorrow. Yes, Honey. Anything you wear and wherever you are, you will look beautiful. Am I getting fatter, Adrian? Look. I have boxer arms. My cheeks are getting chubbier. Oh, no. I have to go on a diet. No, you don't have to. You are not getting fattier. Look, Adrian. My cheeks are chubbier than yesterday. Right? Maybe a little bit. I knew it. I can't do this. Which one is better? This one. I will take this one. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Hi, Freya. You have gotten Sheila's birthday invitation, right? -Yes, I have. -Let's go together. Just go to my house after school and get ready at my mom's salon. Look, I want my dress to look like this. It is stunning, isn't it? It is. Can I come to the salon? Adrian will be busy with his basketball and Moses with his course. We will have fun at the salon. We are on a very tight schedule. We will get manicure, pedicure, body scrubs, facial, nail art. There's just not enough time. Gia, it is Sheila's birthday, not ours. Why are we panicking over it? How about changing your hairstyle, Freya? How about ombre hair? Since we have been friends, I have never seen you with a new style. Tonight... You will look different. -Ombre hair like this? -Yes. Okay. Okay. Relax. Happy birthday, Sheila. -Thank you. -Pleasure. -Happy birthday. -Where's Gia and Freya? They are on the way. We can't find it at school. You... Hi, Honey. What did you do with your hair, Freya? I am asking you, Freya. What did you do with your hair? Don't exaggerate so much, Moses. Gia, why does Freya have to wear a dress like this... ...and dye her hair? Stop being dramatic, Moses. Freya is not a child. She can do anything she likes without asking for your permission. Relax, Moses. Maybe she wants to look different. Let's go home, Freya. -Go home. -But... Moses. Moses... But, Moses, I haven't met... She looks beautiful. Moses is crazy. Freya... Freya. I am sorry. Forgive me. Is it wrong... ...if I want people to say that I am beautiful... ...just for once? You are beautiful, Freya. You don't have to change to be beautiful. You don't have to do what Gia tells you to. Gia talks nonsense. No. Gia is not wrong. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. Where did you go yesterday? Why didn't you go to dinner with me and mom? I am going to my room. Adrian. I am talking to you. Stop being upset with me. What do you want? I should be asking you that. What do you want that you cheated on Mom? Adrian. Adrian. Please stop it. Stop it. Adrian. Adrian. I have never taught you to speak so harsh like that. Mom. He hurt you. He has destroyed everything. Why did you stand up for him? Whatever it is that he has done, he is still your dad. Forgive your dad. Hey. You don't have to do it today. It doesn't have to be right away. But I am asking you from the bottom of my heart. Please forgive your dad. Don't come home too late tomorrow. Let's eat dinner together. I will make your favorite spaghetti. You really don't want to go to Puncak with me? How can I come? It is a student council event. I am not even a member. Besides, I have plans with my mom. Hi, Freya, Moses. Are you ready? I'm off, Freya. Right, can you take notes for me while I am at Puncak? Sure. Let's go. Bye. -Take care. -Alright. -Bye, Honey. -Bye, Honey. -I'm off, Adrian. -Don't read books while driving. You do that all the time. Bye. Hey. Kerplunk. You can do it, Freya. You can do it. You can do it. Focus. Come on. Focus. Focus, Freya. Focus on your wrist movement. -Adrian. -Like this. Hey... Freya? Where are you going? If you need help with basketball, I can help you. Come here. Here. First, don't put you arms this way. Put your arms like this. Focus on the square. Throw the ball. Just like that. Okay? You try it. Okay. Arms this way. Okay. Now. -That was close. -That was close. Okay. Let's do this again. Focus. Higher your arms. Okay. One, two, three. -Yeah! -I did it! You did great. You really like basketball, do you? I love it, Freya. What is your hobby? I am sure you have a hobby. How boring. My life is different from yours. My life is plain. But I want to be someone else sometimes. I want to live a life like others... ...that is more lively, exciting, and... I am talking nonsense, am I? I am sorry. Freya. If you were given a chance to do two things, what would they be? -Why are you laughing? -Well... You are talking to me... ...like you are a genie that just came out of a lamp. I am serious. What would they be? Well... I want to fly. Although I know that I can never fly, but I still want to know what it feels like to be flying. Okay. And the second one? I want to have a romantic dinner like the one in the movies. -Romantic dinner? -Yes. Does Moses never take you to romantic dinner? Never. Really? Adrian... Thank you. My pleasure. Hello, Gia. Freya... Gia? What happened? Are you crying? Please help Adrian, Freya. His mom got into an accident. What? How is she now? She is okay, right? She passed away. Freya, please go to the hospital and accompany Adrian... ...until Moses and I arrive, okay? Okay, I am going now. Don't worry. Okay. Sir, there are some papers you have to sign. Okay. Adrian. Freya? What are you doing here? You should go home. It is late. Adrian... I am fine. I am okay. Nobody is fine when their loved ones leave them. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to keep crying and hugging my mom who has died? Or do you want me to find the bastard who hit my mom... ...and kill them? Is that what you want? Huh? I know exactly how you feel. No. You don't. You don't have a clue about my feeling. -You are not me. -I don't have to be you... ...to know how you feel. My mom died six years ago. So I know exactly how you feel. And I know what makes you sad. Freya... My mom... Adrian! Gia. Adrian, are you okay? Sorry I am late, Adrian. I was stuck in traffic. -It is okay. -Don't be sad, Adrian. I am here now. I am fine. I am sorry, Bro. I am really sorry. Mom! Where have you been, Adrian? I have been calling you all day. Everyone is worried about you. I am hungry. Let's eat. Where have you been all day, Adrian? Everyone at school is worried about you. I went to get some fresh air. Okay, then. I made the copies of today's lessons for you. Don't forget to read these up. We will have a quiz tomorrow. Have you studied? We will study together at your house then. What do you want to eat tonight? How about I make you your favorite spaghetti? The one your mom used to make? Adrian? Adrian? What did I do wrong? Adrian. Morning. Where is Gia? You haven't eaten breakfast, have you? Here. I brought some Nutella sandwich. Do you want some? Here. Take it. I had my basketball test yesterday. I got quite a good grade. It was okay, not as bad as usual. Thank you, Basketball Master. I would not have passed if it weren't for you. I miss my mom. Did you see that Adrian is like a living corpse? Pale, cold, and a mess. I can't see him like this. Adrian just needs some time, Gia. He will be back to normal. When? When will he be back to normal? When will he smile again? We have to find a way. We have to find a way to cheer him up. I am bored. Let's watch a movie on MovieBox. Don't be silly. Exams are coming up soon, Gia. Jeez, Moses, aren't you bored with those books everyday? Take Freya out on a date for once. You're coming, right? Sounds good. It's okay if we go for a movie first, right? Is it okay if I come along? It is a yes if nobody is complaining. -Let's go, then. -Let's go! Guys, let's watch a romantic movie. Please. Why are we spending so much money just for a movie like that, Gia? What do you mean? Melancholy. Shut up! You are like a robot. You can't be romantic. Do you have any romantic movies? Let me find it. What do you want to watch? Romantic ones, right? Of course. I want to watch a romantic movie with you, Gia. -Come here. -What is it? He wants to take you to lunch. He likes you. Bara! Damn you. Are we going to eat lunch? Yes, eat your mustache. I am going to the toilet. I am going to the toilet. -Are you ready? -I am ready. -I am going. -Wait for me! Please wait. I don't want to be alone. Adrian? What are you doing here? I was just... Wait for me, Sister! I am sorry. I have to go first. The movie was so sweet. I bet it is great to have a boyfriend who is that sweet. Adrian? Are you listening, Adrian? I am talking to you. Please say something. Talk to me if you have a problem. I will never know how you feel if you don't talk to me. What's wrong with you, Adrian? Adrian... I am fine, Freya. As far as I remember, I haven't change my name to Freya. Gia... Gia. Gia... Gia... Gia. I know I was wrong, Gia. Gia... Gia. I am sorry. The ringtone of my phone Makes me smile in the morning You tell stories All night with me in my dreams Somehow I feel your presence here Laughing at your jokes Entertains me when I am alone I am here and you are there Only meeting via calls Yet I always wait Until we will meet Although right now you are far away We see the same sky Far from view, but close to my heart The ringtone of my phone makes me smile In the morning Why are you staring at them kissing like you have never done it? Huh? You haven't, have you? Don't talk so loud. Moses... How is your relationship with Freya? What do you mean? Are you serious with her? Of course. But whether we have or have not kissed, it has nothing to do with our relationship. I know that my relationship with Freya is different from yours with Gia. But I am not playing around. I am not playing around with Freya. Do you care for her? Very much. Do you know what she likes? Do you know what she wants? -Moses... -Freya. What's wrong with you? What do girls like the most? I mean... What do you think girls like the most? Maybe just like the movie we watched. Girls like to be spoiled, caressed, and we like flowers. But actually, not all girls like to be treated that way. How about you? What do you want the most? Me? I like chocolate. I like to drink tea while watching the rain. I like to study with you. I like to study math although it gives me headache right away. I like to read to comics and... -Which book is it? -I don't remember. Let's find it. Which book is it? -It is a math book! -Right. Math... -Where is it? -I can't find it. Here it is. Freya. Yes, Dad. Your friend is here. I will be there in a minute, Dad. Adrian? -Come here. -Hold on. -Wait. -Dad... Just a minute, Sir. What are you doing here? I want to kidnap you. Stop being silly. I am not. I am serious. I want to fulfill your two wishes. Huh? Come on, please let me do it. Just once. No problem. You will fly today. Are you ready? -Are you serious? -Yes, I am. It is okay. Ready? What do you think, Freya? Now you are flying. It is fun, is it? Look at the view. No. Open your eyes. I am scared. Let me just close my eyes. Relax, Freya. I am here. Open your eyes. -Okay. -Do it. Okay, I will open my eyes. Wait. One, two... It is exciting, right? Adrian! I am flying! I am flying! I am flying! How is it, Freya? Beautiful, right? I am sorry our romantic dinner is this bad. It is a frugal dinner instead. I am happy with this. Thank you. My pleasure. As-salamu alaykum. What is it? Here is your order. -Okay, thank you. -You're welcome. -Sir. -What is it? I ordered sweet iced tea. Yes, that is sweet iced tea. Where is the ice? The ice? Well... This is a cold place. So, it is better if you just avoid ice. Sir. Yes? The sugar? The sugar? I... Well... I got so big because I consumed too much sugar. So, it is better if you just avoid sugar. Sir, I want sweet tea. I see. Your girl is already sweet. I just want this tea to be sweet. Well... Just put her finger in the tea to make it sweet. Done. Where have you been? Why do you just go like that without telling anybody? Gia has been waiting for you. Can you leave us alone? Gia. Gia... Gia. Gia. Could you stop making me mad just for once? Could you stop running away like this just for once? I am tired, Adrian. Where have you been? -I... -Went to get fresh air? Are you happy now? What am I to you, Adrian? If I am still your girlfriend, you should not treat me like this. You should not be running away like this. You just go as you please without telling me. I am going home. -I will drive you. -I can drive myself. Hello, Moses. Hi, Freya. Where have you been? I have been trying to reach you. I went out with Gia. I left my phone. I see. I didn't know where you were. I tried calling you several times and you did not pick up. Have you eaten? I have. Have you studied? I have. Okay, then. Get some rest, okay? You too. I love you. Just respond to the letter. I already have you. Why should I respond to another guy? Maybe... ...there is another guy who is better for you. Who is more suitable. I don't know what you mean. Maybe I am not the right guy for you. Is it you who is not right for me anymore... ...or is it me who is not right for you anymore? Gia... Everything is different now. Everything has changed. It is not like before. Everything changes everyday. But my feeling for you is still the same. You feel the same, right? I don't know. So, when are you going to tell me? When are you going to tell me... ...that you don't care for me anymore, and you like another girl? Gia? Gia? What happened? It is Freya, right? That's enough, Adrian. Stop lying and running from me. I know everything. I know everything without you even telling me. Adrian. What did you tell Gia? Why is she crying like that? I didn't say anything. Don't lie to me. I know everything. I told Gia that I love you. How could you do that? I can't keep lying to her. And I can't keep hiding my feeling, Freya. That is not fair. That is not fair. Freya... What we did yesterday was not right. Maybe we were just bored with our relationship. And maybe we should not have been close. Maybe all your feelings for me will be gone tomorrow. Maybe. But for now, I know for sure that I love you. That is all that matters. -Freya... -No. Gia. Gia. Come in, Freya. Gia... You are okay, right? Everything is fine with Adrian, is it? I want to apologize. I made you and Adrian fight. Freya... Do you like Adrian? Answer me, Freya. I just... I just adore him. Just like the other girls at school. I envy your relationship. I envy your relationship because I can't have that with Moses. I love Moses. And I also love you. I have no intention to destroy all that. I just see Adrian as my bestfriend's boyfriend. My bestfriend whom I love. You know it, Freya. You know that we have a serious relationship. I love him so much. I have given everything to Adrian. Everything, Freya. I even slept with him. Freya... Freya. Freya... Freya... Freya! Get off of me. You are not who I thought you were. After what you have done to Gia, you should have cared for her instead of hurting her. I am not going to lie to Moses anymore, I don't want to hurt Gia anymore, and I want nothing to do with you anymore. Don't leave Gia. Just forget about me. There was never an us. There was never... Let me go. -Okay. -Please. Freya... Okay. I will do whatever you say. But let me hug you for the last time. Freya. You two... I love Freya, Moses. I don't know when this happened. But I love Freya. And I know I should not have said that. So you guys have been dating behind my back and Gia's? You love each other secretly. You like each other secretly. You two hug each other, or did you even kiss? Moses... It is not like that. -You are my bestfriend. How can I... -Bestfriend you say? No bestfriends would do this. Moses... Moses. I don't need a bestfriend like you. Adrian... I really love you, Adrian. What do I have to do to make you stay? What do I have to do, Adrian? Don't leave me, Adrian. Don't leave me ever again. Moses... I am sorry. For what? Do you love him? Freya... I think it is better if we break up. I can't date someone who doesn't love me anymore. Freya... Thanks for these past three years. Mam, I want one. When will you guys stop this fight? You are all adults. But you guys act like kids. You ignore your friends. And you pretend to not know each other. That is stupid, you know that? You too, Freya. What's wrong with you, Honey? Adrian... I am happy... ...because you are always by my side. And I am happy... ...because we have been together for these past two years. It's been lovely, you know? But... ...I am not happy seeing you like this. I love you. And I want you to be happy. Hello. Hello? Hello, Freya. Gia? Freya! How are you? I am... I am fine. How about you? I am fine. Adrian is also fine. Freya? Do you... Do you still love Adrian? After all this time, you call me right now just to ask that? Actually, I want to apologize. I am sorry because I just left. And I am sorry... ...because I asked Adrian to go to London with me... ...and study here. And we never said goodbye to you. It's okay. I heard that you got a scholarship in Hong Kong. I am actually planning to meet my aunt in Hong Kong. Can we meet? Are you serious? You are planning to go here? We have to meet. We have to. We should clear our schedule. Okay, I will call you when I get there. Okay? Okay. Bye, Freya. See you soon. Freya! Freya! Gia! Gia! I miss you so much. I really do. Where is your glasses? I threw them away to the sea. What's wrong, Gia? You look so pretty. Let's talk over there. Let's go. Freya... I want to apologize... ...for not being honest with you. What do you mean? I never slept with Adrian. I was upset at that time, and I lied to you. Why didn't you say that you liked Adrian? Why did you lie? Because I don't want to lose my bestfriend. I don't care about losing anything else. But I don't want to lose a bestfriend. I am not with Adrian anymore. I decided to end our relationship. Because I know... ...that Adrian still care for you a lot. -Gia... -I am okay, Freya. I know my heart will never be the same. But I will be okay. Freya... Whatever you say, however you deny it, love will always be there, professing its existence. Adrian? Hey. What are you doing here? Are you free on Sunday? Yes, I am free. Will you take me to get around Hong Kong? I just met you yesterday You already made me feel devastated If we were apart for a week I wouldn't know what my life will be When I miss you I always feel uneasy I lose my appetite I always think about you He is the one The love that I long for He makes me feel stunned He is the one The lover that I long for He is the one When I miss you I always feel uneasy I lose my appetite I always think about you He is the one The heart that I long for He makes me feel fascinated He is the one The lover that I long for He is the one He is the one The love that I long for He makes me feel astounded He is the one He is the one He is the one The lover that I long for The lover that I long for Thank you, Adrian. I hope that your second wish that I messed up the last time... ...has been fulfilled now. I can't believe you make both my wishes come true. And now we are eating at this romantic place. I really can't believe it. Thank you so much. Sure. See? Freya... Forgive me. I was selfish. I acted without thinking. And I am sorry I can only say this now. Do not ever leave me again. I love you, Freya.
