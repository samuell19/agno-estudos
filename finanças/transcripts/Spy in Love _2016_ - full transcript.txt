PENANG DRAGON BOAT RACE FESTIVAL We will continue next week. - How are you, friend? - I'm great. How does it feel to have retired? Teaching all day in a class? Kris, I really miss being in the field. Yes, of course. But... it's not for us anymore. Let the younger guys solve the problems. So, what brings you here? You're not here for a cup of tea, I bet. That's right. Look, the young guns nowadays may have the gusto, but as analysts, they're not cut out for the job. You were the best analyst on our team. What's this? Have a look. OK. Good afternoon, Satria. Your analysis of the cause of the lost plane seems to be right. It was not lost due to an accident, but rather, due to something we should investigate. We just received a video uploaded by someone. Looks like it's not a hoax. I understand your urge to go into the field to take action. But this time around, you just sit behind your desk and do your work from there. Hey, handsome grandpa, how are you? Hey, kiddo. I want to take you to my workplace. There's something I want to discuss. I'm busy. Busy? With what? I really am busy. I'm not idle, kid. But aren't you retired...? Listen. I'm currently busy teaching post-grad students. I've checked, and I know that the semester break starts next week. You could come over for a week or two. - Wait, where are you now? - For real? You don't know, Grandpa? I'm in Penang now. Penang? - Yes, I work in a hotel. - Penang. Tickets and accommodations have been arranged. Just come. See you, gramps! Right, I want flowers in every walkway and lanterns on every table, five on those tables, and five over here, OK? Now, if I can ask the groom to follow me? Is everything good? Shall we start then? - We can rehearse. - Yes. - OK. Any time you're ready. - OK. OK, let's begin. I hereby declare Yasmin binti Muhammad Syarif to be my wife, following the nuptial dowries. Putra... Putra! What are you doing? I'm working here, stop fooling around! I'm not fooling around. Honey. Putra, marriage isn't something you can fool around with, baby. Have you put enough thought into it? Honey. Look into my eyes. I'm serious about this. Yes? - Where are you? - Penang. Why Penang? All the leads pointed here, right? Yes, but you only need to work from behind your desk. The information we have will be more complete if I'm here. Penang is in turmoil right now. Another country has sent its agent to get that video, too. Are there any particular features they have that would stand out? Listen carefully. The agent's in all black. Black rose earrings, a black hat, and a black dress. - Right, thanks. - Be careful. - Gramps! - Hello, my dear! So? What do you mean? - Where is the car? - Here's the car. So, how was the flight? Come on. Across the road. Come in. So, how are you, gramps? You like it? It's nice. So, gramps. I invited you here because I've been meaning to share some important news with you. I'm getting married! Getting married? - Mom, I want to share some good news. - OK. What is it? A diamond ring? Exquisite! Where's she from? Manado? Ambon? Papua? Putra proposed to me. The Indonesian guy? Yes. Yasmin is Malaysian, gramps. I don't approve. Mom, you've always said that, right from the start. You've said it so many times, but you never say why. No means no. Your mom was a cop! Look at what Indonesians do. Look at the forest fires. Your great-grandpa was in the army! I don't like having to wear a face mask every time I go out. And I work for the National Intelligence Bureau. My makeup, my lipstick, and powder... Look at you... working at a hotel here... and trying to marry an obscure woman! A Malaysian! - What do you mean OK? The smoke-- - Yes, the smoke, I get it. But let's not stereotype Indonesians like that. No matter where I work as a hotel manager, in Europe or the US, I'll always be a loyal citizen of my country, gramps. I'll never denounce my nationality. Besides, you've never met him. You don't know how he is as a person. Don't be so judgmental. You're not a soldier, fine. But marry someone of our own-- Someone from Indonesia! All right. Mom, I have to go to work. Come to dinner tonight, OK? Gramps, just take a rest. You look exhausted. Tonight we're going to have dinner with Yasmin's family. Putra will be coming, too. So, I very much hope that... You'll like it. OK? See you tonight! Now get some rest. Oh, no, I don't think so. I'm leaving now. Bye! That's Putra. Putra. Mom, this is Putra. - Hi, I'm Putra. - Hi. How are you? - Honey, I brought my grandpa, too. C'mon. - OK. Gramps, this is my girlfriend, Yasmin. Yasmin, this is my Grandpa. - Hi. - Hi, Grandpa. And the other lady is her mom, Fazira. Yasmin, do you remember that I told you about how lots of old men stare at me? He's one of them. Is that right? Our first meeting and she's already slandering me? There has to be a misunderstanding. Honey, let's sit. Mom? Yasmin, it's true. She's wrong and stubborn. Son, are you sure about your choice? Miss Fazira, let's indulge ourselves with some dinner. If there's still a problem, it's better to sweep it under the rug. Now, let's enjoy our special evening and feel the warmth that binds us together. I agree. I don't think I want to eat down here. I'll eat up in my room instead. That's right. Take her there, or she'll freeze. She's not used to this. OK. You know what? I'm fine. I'll stay here. Babe, you hear that? - That's our song, yeah. - What song? - Yeah, our song. - Oh, our song? - Yeah, that's right. - Yes. Our song. Gramps, Miss Fazira, relax, have a chat. Look at how they stumble while they are dancing. I'm not sure if they can survive marriage. I don't think they can manage married life. Your daughter is to blame. She's not used to dancing with men. No. Your grandson dances like a rigid dinosaur. Just look at him. He can't follow the way my daughter flows. Well, in every part of the world, men are always the leaders. Isn't it imperative that later in marriage, a wife must abide by and obey her husband? Another country sent its agent, wearing black rose earrings. Be careful! What're you looking at? Lewd! Hey! What the... Damn you! Why are you touching me? He touched me! - "Lewd"? - You're a pervert! "Pervert"? Yasmin, this old fart touched me! Something is wrong with this woman, son! - Are you OK, Mom? - I won't budge. My decision remains unchanged. I don't want you to marry that weirdo's grandson! What're you talking about, Mom? That doesn't sound like Satria. He might have been a little weird tonight, but he's really a good man. Come on now, do you know him that well? Do you really know each other? You've only just met him! Listen to me. I don't want you to go near them again. Look at me! Hey, are you sure that the Malaysian agent was wearing black earrings? Yeah, that's what our intel told us. Why, what's wrong? All right. She's not an agent then. Who? That sharp-tongued woman. You need to be cautious. If that agent is after the same thing as you, she must be close! What's with the language? Use our national language! What's the matter, gramps? Is there a problem? Oh, she started it, not me. Yasmin is important to me, gramps. We've made plans for... Come in. I have to go now. We're not done with this, yet, Grandpa. There you go, sir. Hey, could you please clean out the bathroom? It's dirty. Yes, sir. Now. Hey, while you're at it, why not drink with me? No, thanks, sir. - I'll drink first? - Yes, sir. No, you first. Just relax, OK? You had a shower yet? Hmm? Get up. Who sent you? Tell me who sent you. OK? Huh. Dead, huh? The black rose you mentioned earlier wasn't just an accessory, but rather, a symbol. Will you look into this? This door... or that one? You dirty man! Pervert! Yasmin! - I'm so sorry! Sorry! - Mom! - I'm really sorry, I got the wrong room. - Stay away from him, stay away. Close the door! - Get out! - OK. - OK! Get out! - Just leave! Now, quick! - Why is he even here? - OK. Get out, gramps. Why are both your parents here? They fought...? We both apologize for the trouble our parents caused earlier. Your apology alone isn't enough. Not to mention the room attendant who's unconscious... Yes, sir, I understand, and I'll make sure they do, too. And if need be, I'll cover the hospital costs. How could it happen? Because of our nationalities, sir. I'm Indonesian, while Yasmin... is Malaysian. All right, look, a piece of advice. Get their approval. So, how do we do that? OK, so today's agenda is, you are going to pair up. The people who get the same number will be partners. - Sorry, what? - It's you, Mom! OK, so the number is... Wow. Go on. Please. - What? This is a setup. - It's fine. - What is this? Me with that old... - What is this? I... - I want to change my number, OK? - Oh, no, no, sorry. We have seen it, right? They have the same number. Where are we going? It's written in the clue. Read it! Here. Comel! Yes, yes, I know. I hear it often. Comel means fussy; finicky. Hey, you're talking to a Malaysian, remember? And here, comel means beautiful, charming, dreamy, and pretty. That's comel! So, thank you! Just read the clue! Read it! Molded out of love, it travels from the gut to the heart. This! - Hey. - Watch it! You old fart. Such a pervert. Are you sure this is the place? Hey? Are you certain now? Because there's no sign. Welcome to Passion Hut! All the foods here are made with love. What will you have, ma'am? Sorry, we didn't come here for the food. We came following clues for the food gathering contest. I don't understand. What I mean is, we're here not to eat, we're following a lead as part of a game. - But you need to order something here. - Hold on! What's good here? Javanese noodles. - Give me one serving! OK. - OK, have a seat. Hey, wait. Are you serious? No! Why would you order food at a time like this? We're in a competition! OK, fine. If we lose this game, I won't take the fall. What's this? Can I try it? Yeah? I'M THE FINEST NET CREPES IN A BIG COUNTRY WHICH BECOMES SMALL This is tasty. Hey, look. - Read it. - Yeah, yeah hold it. - Let's go now! - But, I'm eating. - Look at this, look! - Oh, thanks. Oh my God. - Be done with it, come on! - What? Read that. Read! Hey, this... Hey, are you certain this is the next clue? - Yes, I'm certain. Hurry! - So, we're not eating? OK, OK. Ma'am, you need to pay. Oh... do I pay for the meal? You ate it, so you pay for it. Goodbye! Pay up. They are leaving the restaurant. To Little India. Hey! Hands off me! We're not here to shop! We're using a bike. That means we can carry things. Just one! The first diner was better. This one's the best. This is the best. "I am the finest net crepes in a big country which becomes small." This is hard! I don't get it. "The best"? What does it mean by "the best"? This is all about taste. Yours and mine might be different. Of course they're different. But there must be some common ground. If we find a delicacy that we both like, then it is the best! Thanks a lot. Filled the belly? If we had known what this game would be about, we could've skipped breakfast. Well, the title is "food gathering." We gather food. Yeah. Hey, you sure know a lot about this place. Have you been here often? All of this information is in books. Reading books, huh? Or did you just see pictures? Well, I'm a lecturer, so books are my bread and butter! Really? You're a lecturer? You? Don't I look like one? A lecturer, hmm? So, I managed to locate the phone that was used to upload the video. Its location is close to you. I will send you the coordinates. Good luck. Keep going! Kid, would you like to see some magic? Look... choo, choo, choo, gone! Oh, look! In your ear! Now, can I do a magic trick on your phone? Hand it over... watch. Nang, ning, nong, ning, nang, ning, nong... - Papa! - Yes? What is it? - A man took my phone. - What? - A man took my phone. - Where is he? - He's over there. - Where? - Is that the kid's phone? - Over there. I don't know anything. - What phone thief? - Hey! Hey! - My phone! - What? They're following us! Oh, no. Here comes the kid's uncle. Hand me the phone! I told you to give back the phone! The kid's uncle is a policeman! Give. Me. The. Phone. Just give it back, hurry! OK. Give it to him. Hurry. Hurry up! Get in the van! Get in? No. I want to go home. The phone is yours! - Get in the van! - OK. - Get inside! - OK! Don't say anything that will get us into trouble. Oops, sorry. Hey! Don't. I told you the kid's mom would be expecting us here. It's all right, leave this to me. Good evening. Hi, madam. We're... terribly sorry for this. The phone taken, was it your son's? My friend here was just playing a prank. He may look old, but he's got a knack for being playful. So, we're sorry! - OK... - Have a seat. I was so scared, but you two know each other? That was scary. Same reason as you. Beyond that. Go buy a new phone. There's plenty of stores near here. So, you're... the hijacker? What did you do to all the passengers? Where are they? Shall we go back? You're brutal! What is she talking about? - What is...? - Calm down. Enough. Calm down. OK, OK. Hey, it's fine. Stop it. OK. Relax, ma'am. Doc, I swear all my organs are tainted and damaged. My kidneys are just... All my organs are tainted and damaged I swear... I'm battery-operated. You are done? We're safe! Thank you, sir! Go hide over there! - Are you OK? - That was awesome. You have the potential to be an agent. Come. Huh... what's this? Come on! Get up. What did you do? The key, where is it? Come on. One, two, three. Get up. Where are they? They still haven't shown up. Honey, calm down, all right? If your mom is with my grandpa, everything's fine, OK? What makes you so sure? Fazira... Remember. Don't tell them anything. Everyone. Mom. Mom. - I'm OK. - See? They are fine. Where have you been? Sir! Where have you been? That geezer is still good after all. He laid our headquarters to waste. We can't underestimate him. Deploy all of our assets. Honey, have you seen my mom? Looking for her? I'm looking for Grandpa, too. I haven't seen him since this morning. My mother has also been missing since this morning. Why do humans have to be closer to God? - I... - Putra. Looks like they are on good terms now. Which means... we finally will get their blessings for our marriage. Our plan worked, honey. What's wrong? Your eyes... resemble those of my wife's. You are the second person to say that about my eyes. My ex-husband. He said my eyes were... mean and scary. Like a ghost's. No wonder he's the ex. We got divorced when Yasmin was 17. Must've been hard for her. Not really. Yasmin isn't like the other girls. She never shows her sadness. But I know that deep down, she's crushed. Jasmin once skipped class just to take me for a walk. Watching movies, eating a lot... Maybe she wanted to see her mom smile again. Yes, indeed. We're... like best friends. We share stories. When she told me about Putra... for an instant, I felt like she'd grown up. So, I became afraid I would lose her. I can't accept that. I understand. But no one is ever ready to lose someone. When Putra was seven, both his parents died in an accident. My relationship with Laras, his mom... wasn't good. I was too obsessed with work. As a result, I wasn't a good father figure. But after Putra was born, I got a second chance to fix everything. So, I became very strict with him. So strict that I didn't want him to think that marrying was something he could decide on a whim. So, are we being selfish, then? Not at all. It's normal. Are there parents who wouldn't want the best for their children? So, my Yasmin isn't the best for Putra? - Yeah? - Oh my God. - Is that what you're saying? - No, you're mistaken! Why so serious? Relax, I was kidding! - In the scenario - Scenario Between Anyer and Jakarta We fell in love - Between Anyer and Jakarta - Between Anyer and Jakarta Well, well. You guys sang well. It was like a duet. Hey, we're not finished yet! I see. After this, you can continue singing, but Yasmin and I have something we want to ask you. What is it? What is it? Mm? OK, so... first of all, I'd like to thank God for giving us this beautiful scenery and this beautiful hotel... No, baby... please. When I first met Yasmin, I knew she'd be my wife and... So, Yasmin and I are planning to get married. We already prepped some things, but as for the date itself, it's tentative. We only need one thing from you two. We need your approval, gramps. What do you say? Do you approve of me marrying Yasmin? I'll say this briefly. I agree, but... Yeah! Thanks, gramps, thanks! I knew you'd understand and agree. Wait a minute. I'm not done talking! I agree to marry Fazira. He sure likes to joke around. Grandpa, you're so funny. You're so good at cracking jokes! Be serious, gramps. I said I wanted your mom, Yasmin. I'm serious. Mom. Mom, what is this? Mom, what he said, it wasn't true, was it? Are you serious? You want to marry me? Try it. - Enjoy your food. - Thank you. What's the matter? - What happened? - Mom? Mom, are you OK? - Mom? - Ma'am? - Oh my God! Mom! - Ma'am? Mom, are you OK? Mom! - Mom. Get up, Mom. Oh my God! - Ma'am? Mom? Honey, help me. What was that? Gramps! Who are you? The poison has spread inside Fazira through her blood vessels. She'll be OK, but it'll take some time to heal. PENANG MALAY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUILDING Putra, Yasmin is awake and she is upstairs in the living room. You go see her, OK? Hey! What the heck are you doing there? You got nothing to do? Putra! What's going on? Why is someone trying to kill us? - Why hasn't Mom woken up yet? - Yasmin. You need to have faith. Your mom's going to be OK. She needs a hospital. She needs to be in a hospital, not here! - We can't do that. - Why not? Putra? Putra... What's going on? It's too dangerous. They cannot know that we're still alive. Because they will stop at nothing to kill us. Who are they? What are they after, and why do they want us dead? Putra? You know these people? Yes, they're my dad's business partners. Why? Some time ago, the plane they were on went missing. Up till now, we've been unable to find it. We suspect that it was hijacked and the passengers are being held as hostages. We? Who's "we"? Yasmin. I'm from Interpol. We're investigating the missing aircraft. I don't buy it, love. You're the manager of the Grand Which Hotel. I'm working undercover to protect you. What does... all this have to do with me? You're the daughter of Datuk Syarif. He was supposed to be on board but canceled at the last minute. We haven't heard from him since then. Honey, people will try to get to you to get the information they need on your father. I'm sure the fact that you work at the hotel was actually their doing. Think about it. How did you end up working here? After... Mom and Dad divorced, we never kept in touch. How I got my job in Penang... It was a surprise that came out of the blue, with a big salary, more than I ever got in Kuala Lumpur. That is how they planned to keep you in the hotel until they were ready to get something from you. So, you're really with Interpol? So, all your advances... friendship... love... and your proposal, they were all lies? Were they? Yasmin, think of it like this. We're in a grave situation. And I need you to-- Marriage, is not something to joke about, Putra! It's not a game! My job was to protect you. - And I-- - Say no more! I don't want to hear it! Those four guys were the reasons behind the hijacking, Satria. Who are those guys? Did you know that the World Bank was run by five people? And if four of them die... it's clear... that only one person will rule it. Who is that person? I will let you live just so you can see... your former best student from the Intelligence class... take over the world. The last passenger has died. Only you remain. If you insist on not signing these transfer documents... be ready. You'll see your friends die one at a time. WAITERS' DAYS OFF Good morning, brothers! I'm looking for my grandpa. Do you know where he is? The old man that you stabbed while he was having dinner. Where is he? A black rose symbol, with an eye at the center. They're a secret organization for hire. They've been responsible for terror and kidnapping cases. They are professionals, and high profile. Be careful, friend. We attack tonight. An all-out attack? A big one? Honey. Big Mama said you haven't eaten anything since yesterday. I'm not hungry. You'll get sick. That's not your concern. Your health is my concern. What about my mom who hasn't woken up? Whose concern is that? If Dad is gone... and if Mom is, too, who will care? Who's going to be held responsible? Babe, your mom is going to be all right. OK? Who do you think you are, that you have any say in that? I'm OK. Everybody will be all right. Don't be selfish! We all have our lives and feelings. You can't just play around with them, manipulating them for the sake of reaching your goals. It's unfair. It's unfair, Putra. I'm so sorry, honey. OK? I promise... This is a Glock 17. Range, 25 meters. Caliber, nine millimeters. Your eyes are bigger than your stomach! Here. Big Mama, send me this warehouse's profile. Here's the profile. Study it. There is a basement in there. I am betting that the basement is where they're keeping all the hostages. Is there a way in? Seriously! Just shoot your way in using Big Baby! I'm behind the monitor, so I'll be watching from here. OK. Putra? Putra! Putra? All the transfer documents are ready. The bank is yours now. Big Mama? Grandpa, are you all right? Since when do hotel managers use guns? Since I joined Interpol. Yep. We need to get outta here quickly. We are outnumbered. OK? Come on, hurry! Hurry! I was assigned to the hotel to investigate the missing airplane. Gramps, we are certain that there's more to it than just a simple hijacking. Come on, hurry! Let's get out! Do you still remember how to use this? Let's go. Come on, let's go. It's over. The World Bank is now ours. And soon enough, all the world leaders will perish. The plane will hit a local convention center located in London: a meeting that we devised to gather all world leaders together, making them vulnerable targets. Why Malaysia? They can be used as scapegoats to deliver... our message. Yeah, I'm watching it now. I'm going to contact MI6 right away. Putra? I'm very sorry, I... I snuck inside the car and I fell asleep there. Kith, let her go. I have nothing to do with her anymore, leave her. Putra! He's not here! I want to see... whether you're the liar, or whether it's this pretty lady! Kith! Set her free! She has nothing to do with us. Kneel. No! If he truly loved you, he wouldn't have spoken that way. - You'd better shoot him. - No. - Just shoot. Take the gun. - No! Hold this. Grab. Aim at him. What now? Shoot! The one big mistake I made regarding you, Yasmin... He's right, I'm a guy that lied to you, hurt you, but... the one thing you're wrong about is: I'm not playing around with you. My job was to... watch over you. I was not allowed to make contact with you at all. I was to watch over you and report in. That was it. But when I proposed to you, I crossed a line and compromised my professional ethics. If you do not shoot... I... will... shoot you. Shoot! Mission accomplished! All right! Listen to this Really melodious I never lied about that. So, you still want to put on this ring, right? FLAMINGO HOTEL Imagine, though, if we get married... What would Putra call you? Would Yasmin call me "Father," or '"Grandpa"? Even worse, Putra would have to call his wife "Auntie." Way too weird! May I ask you something? When you proposed to me, were you serious or joking? I'm pretty sure... marriage is not for us anymore. What we need is a partner to go on adventures with. Wherever we go, we stick together, and we adventure together. Is this... a challenge? Certainly! Do you accept? Challenge... accepted. - Kris. - Hi! Sorry to interrupt, but there's a new case you need to solve ASAP. A drug lord. I'll send you the profile. Considering your big success with the Penang case, I think you two need to do this one together. You and your grandson. Yeah? Hmm, this is interesting. We have a deal, right? Two generations of spies But what about our honeymoon? Honey, this is state duty. But…
