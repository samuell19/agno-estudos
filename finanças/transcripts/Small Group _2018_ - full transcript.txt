Oh you got mentioned in an Uber Critic article. "Documentary film maker, R. Scott Cooper "graduated from film school nearly 12 years ago. "Long enough for him to have clearly forgotten "the day they taught about knowing one's audience." "In his directorial debut... " Done a few shorts. "'Mom's Basement', Cooper seems genuinely interested "in maintaining his objectivity. "Yet still somehow manages to utterly destroy "his subject matter, gaming culture, which is by the way, "the only audience who would actually pay" "to see a documentary about gaming." It goes on from there. Yeah I probably owe him a beer, because it's like the nicest one I've read yet. You don't think the subjects of this new film are going to be 10 times more sensitive than the gamers? Aw, of course they will. But this time I won't just seem interested in objectivity, I'll protect it like a guard dog. Have you seen my french press? Yep, it's in that one. - Really? - Or this one. What are you doing? That one? I just don't know what I'm supposed to do all day. Yeah no, I totally get it. We're in a new town, in a new house, we got no friends. I have no job. You have no job. And we have no more wine. That's a problem. I know. What were we talking about? You were trying to cheer me up unsuccessfully. Right. Yeah, so I think that once we settle in, cost of living down here is nothing. And maybe this is a good time for you to open your yoga studio. - What? - Yeah. Come on, why not? Huh? You know why. You can sell it when we move back. Or once this documentary is a massive hit, and we're both millionaires, and you'll have a studio in Georgia and another in L.A. You'll be a bi-coastal yoga mogul. What? Or is it a bi-coastal moga yogul? No, I said it right the first time. My yosta, coca bogul. I love you. But you're drunk. Go to bed. Hey. God haters, mockers, fornicators, cry to God and save your soul. It's not too late. Repent. Repent. Repent. Hey, welcome back to the sweaty south, Scotty Cooper. Mr. Ballard Nelson. Thanks for bringing me home, man. Ah it's good, good, good. So this is us? Yeah. Yeah, that's me right on top there. Nice. You're in the basement. Okay. Cool. Good morning, Heather. Good morning, Mr. Nelson. Extra cream extra sugar, right? Oh that's so sweet. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Just like to keep my team happy. Since when does the producer fetch coffee for the intern? You dirty old dog. You're gonna feel guilty about that one day. Ah, I don't feel guilty about anything. Ever. Nah, but this old guy out here sure thinks I should though. Look at him. These are the answers. They're just teeing it up for us. Well you know that guy isn't exactly representative of your people that... And you know what, you're gonna knock this thing outta the park. Now you know that, right? - Yeah. - Yeah? Good, come on. Now sit, sit, sit. You don't know how much I miss making documentaries. You don't. It's magic, it's a beautiful thing. You know our targets. They're just like fish in a barrel. It's just gonna be a breeze, a breeze. Well you know targets is kind of a strong term. Maybe we should stick with subjects. Oh, I got something I gotta show you boy. That is a cross cam, man. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. - I had that custom made, for you. That's, that's pretty cool. But I got a C100, much better resolution. Yeah well you know what, I'll tell ya something. Maybe a button cam'll work. Appreciate your help. Love the enthusiasm. But I don't go undercover. That's not how I go. Look kid. Huh? Now I hired you 'cause you're a pit bull and because evangelicals are on the ropes. Now we are going to deal them a blow and collect the prize money. Now there's nothing wrong with cashing in on public opinion, now is there? Nah. I'm in the business of exposing the truth to the public. But I do it with people's consent. Come again? This, I can't do. Oh? Listen buddy, I'm the one who gave you a second chance when Hollywood wouldn't. And you know it. This is the only play you have. So come on. I'll figure something out. You're gonna have to find somebody else to direct this. Good luck to ya. You're under contract, cowboy. See you tomorrow. Oh hey babe, I didn't hear you pull up. I am on a roll. I'm almost done in here. I don't pay attention to the living room. It's a disaster. But this place is actually gonna look pretty cute once I get it all finished. I still can't find my french press. But I know it's somewhere here. - We're not staying. - It's just. Very funny. Listen sweetie, do you want your juicer out on the countertop or can I put it under the cupboard? I'm serious, we're not staying, we're leaving, we're getting outta here. We're packing it up, we're going back to California. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there Sparky, what's going on? The film, this job, it's not what I thought it was. It's not a documentary about Christianity? It is that, that's the subject. But it's not a documentary. It's a muck rake. What does that even mean? You know like he wants me to wear spy cameras and trick people and lie. And that's not my bag, baby. I'm not doing it. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. Hey there. Hi choo choo, what's up? Daddy, I've got my room all cleaned up and I even left a little space for a bunny cage. Oh that's great, choo choo. - Wow. - Come on. Okay Daddy'll be there in a second. Okay. Please tell me this isn't happening. All right I made a huge mistake. And I'm sorry, but I'm gonna fix it. Let's just bail before I get us into a much bigger mess. Is he gonna reimburse us for the move at least? I'm not even gonna ask. Babe, have you checked the bank account today? No. Scotty, we're broke. You expecting someone? No. Hi Scott. Hi. Ballard wanted me to drop these by. Oh wow, thanks. Hi Mary, I'm Heather. It's nice to meet you. Hi Heather. Hey, let me know if you guys need any help as you unpack and settle in. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. Have a great day you guys. Thank you. Moving expenses. There's two, what's this one? A letter. "Scott, I think we got off on the wrong foot. "Before you make any big decisions" "will you and your lovely bride join me for dinner?" Holy crap. "P.S. I know a signing bonus wasn't part of the contract "but I think you deserve it." "Hopefully it'll come in handy." 10 grand. My... I love this place. I eat here a few times a week. I can eat all the deep fried food I want. My cholesterol's perfect, Mary. No, it is. Doc says it's some kinda dumb genetic luck. I don't know. I do know that most men my age have to eat like a rabbit or they take pills that make 'em feel so miserable that they're praying to have the heart attack that they're trying to prevent. Mommy, did he say he eats rabbits? No baby, he doesn't eat rabbits. Good. Okay kid, let's talk turkey. Okay yeah. Listen Ballard, I hate this thing is ending before it started, but you gotta admit, you pulled the rug out from under me earlier. You're absolutely right kid, you're right. He's right Mary. I mean, we had a misunderstanding. And for that I apologize. I do. But I just got so excited, I guess, about this project and about the talented guy running it. I guess I got a little too eager. Mm, I get it. You don't wanna be known as a biased hack. Again? Hey come on. Well, you can't, he can't. I'm just not gonna trick people to suit your agenda. Does Michael Moore, the Oscar winner, have an agenda? I'm not Michael Moore. Of course not. You're R. Scott Cooper, man. Let me ask you, are Christians hypocrites? Are they hateful? That's maybe what the pubic thinks. We don't know, do we? You have to get in there, you have to show us why the public would think that. I don't know, maybe they'll prove us wrong. Okay, I like that. That's not how you put it earlier. That was a miscommunication, man. We're past that. We're here to make a movie about the dwindling influence of Christianity in America. I mean that is a stat, that is a fact and no one can deny that premise. All you have to do is let them show you why their influence is shrinking. Does that sound like an agenda driven piece to you, Mary? I don't know, I guess not. What about all the spy gear? Well if you can't go undercover to find the truth, well then I guess I have to find another director. Right? You two didn't cash that check now, did ya? No. That's great. Look you two, you talk it over, ya spend some time. Okay we'll chat in a couple of days. If you're in, great. If not, just return the checks. Both of 'em. And we can part as friends. Yes. Okay. High five. She's beautiful. Just like her mommy. Daddy, can we go get my bunny now? Sweetie, now's not a good time. Can we at least get some ice cream? And a LaCroix maybe? I see what you did there. Well played. We really shouldn't. We're getting her some ice cream. Wahoo! Daddy wants some ice cream. Okay. Mommy want some ice cream? Mommy wants some ice cream. Mommy wants a chocolate sundae. I want strawberry. Hey, what's the story, morning glory? Hey Ballard. I'm in. Crap. I kinda thought you'd be happier. Oh no, no it's good. Good Scott, thanks. That's a great decision. Look here's the deal. We're gonna set up a meeting with a girl named Cori Crowder, she's your field producer. She grew up a Bible thump, a missionary's kid and she's on sabbatical or something now. Ah, an insider. That's right. Yeah set it up. - Done. - Later. Okay, Casey. Flea bags and runts. I'm sorry? No, I get it, I get it. New house, new puppy for the young'n. But you don't want any of these mutts in here, man. Doesn't even look like a dog. Oh you're my new neighbor. No, I like dogs just fine. I used to walk Ms. Toni's old blue tick coon hound. She lived in y'alls house before you moved in there. - Ms. Toni. - Yeah, she died about a month ago. Bless her heart. Yeah. Choked to death on a peppermint. And dropped dead right in there on your kitchen floor. Yeah. Name's Billy. Scott. - Uh huh. - Scott Cooper. - Cooter. - Cooper. Mm, well buddy it's good meeting ya. I reckon I oughta get these rabbits home before they thaw on me. Start jumping away. Gotta shoot 'em again, you know. Well hey neighbor, we'll catch up sometime. - Okay. - We'll have a hoot. I'm looking forward to it, buddy. - Right. - Whoo! Whoo. ♪♪ Pop goes the weasel You little squirt. You got me. Yeah. Okay, I thought I told you two no fun having while I'm at work. Daddy! You're home early. Did you? I did mm hmm, maybe. No, I just thought I'd bring home some lunch. Is it peanut butter and jelly? Not exactly. Carrots? You don't like carrots? No. Do you know who would like carrots? Mommy, any ideas? I might have some. A bunny! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Calm down, sweetie. Calm down. You gotta grab his feet, right here. Okay? Good girl. Aw, very good honey. Do you love her? She looks just like she did in my dreams, Mommy. Aw honey. Her name is Pepper. I love you, Pepper. That's a great name. Can I hold Pepper? Well she's a sweet bunny. Why am I wet? Looks like Pepper's a peer. Pepper! Oh no, no no. That young lady took care of it for you. - She did? - She did. - Thank you. - Have a good one. - Hey. - Cori. Yep, that's me. This must be my field producer. Yes, nice to meet you. That's so kind, thank you. You didn't have to do that. Oh yeah, no of course. No problem. Tis better to give than to receive. Ah, Acts 20:23 or 30 something. 30 something, I knew that. No you didn't. No I didn't. So I watched "Mom's Basement". I have to say you're pretty funny. Thanks. Also a little vicious, which is probably why I'm Ballard likes you. I also got you a gift. Happy 1st day of work. Whoo! That's a lotta words. It is a lotta words. So what's this about you going on sabbatical? Ballard keeps using that word sabbatical. I am not on sabbatical. I don't know, I feel like coming back to the States it seemed like everything was, the church included, was tainted by abundance or something. And I don't know, I'm just so over this rock 'n roll Jesus stage and light show thing. It's not my thing. Huh. Well let's talk about background. Do you have any church experience? Not recently. But growing up my mom's side of the family tried to administer religion like a suppository. Boy, as long as you and your mama are under my roof, it's my Christian duty to make you understand why you gotta get saved. You ever heard of hell? Here, take this lighter. Now light it. Now hold that flame under your hand for a minute. Go on, boy. Ow. Yeah, it hurts, don't it? Now imagine that over every square inch of your body. And not just for a quick second. But for eternity. Now stay here and think about that for a while. You're Aunt Marge is outta smokes. And then there was my freshman year of college when I learned that Christian kindness comes with ulterior motives. Time. New record. - Yes. - Yeah! I'm telling you, I killed Sam's record. - Two boxes. - That is awesome. In two minutes. Are you kidding me? No one's gonna beat that. - That was so much fun. - No one's gonna beat that. You're pretty cool. Yeah, I know. So I've been wanting to ask you a question. Oh yeah? Oh, I'm so sorry. I was actually just wondering if you had found a church home yet? Church home? Yeah, we have this amazing young life program. And I think you'd get a lot out of it. Not what I wanted out of it. I'm sorry? Nothing, nothing. Well, hey honey. This is my friend Scott I was telling you about. Scott, this is my fiance, Jason. Hey, it's great to meet ya, Scott. Likewise. I was just telling him about young life. Oh yeah man, you should join us sometime. Yeah, definitely. This Thursday maybe? Yeah, Thursday. - Can't wait. - Yeah, awesome. Sounds like she wasn't the only one with ulterior motives if you ask me. I was 19, I had hormones. What do you expect? She was a believer, she has the Great Commission. What do you expect? Hmm. All right. So how do I speak like a Christian? Like what's your elevator pitch? Elevator pitch, um. Oh I got an idea. Lay this down. This'll really help. Perfect. Action. Okay, okay so, we're all sinners, right? And since Adam and Eve got together and made the forbidden fruit salad, no matter how hard we try to be close to God, to obey his law, literally none of us can earn our way into his grace. So that's why God sacrificed his son... - Jesus. - Jesus, good. And he showed us a new path to God, a path, the only real path to God through him. Now this right here, this is the part that I don't think gets enough attention ever. He also showed us how to live and to love and not just how to get our tickets punched to heaven. Yeah, so I've always relied on the fact that if I wholeheartedly follow him I'll reject sin and embrace love. And that's true peace, true and pure grace. It comes from God through us to others. I've never heard it put like that. Really? It's simple. And you're cool putting your people under the spotlight? Yeah. Never hurts to show Don Quixote a mirror. Hmm. - All right. - What about you? Why are you doing this? Let's just say I have a rabbit to feed. ♪♪ I will sail over the one who stands for me ♪♪ ♪♪ Lift my hands for the lifted one to see ♪♪ ♪♪ I will dance Ma'am? ♪♪ To the one that ♪♪ Hey man, I'm Chaz.

You guys sound great. You can be seated. Good morning, good morning. Open your Bibles to John chapter 13. And we'll be looking at verses 34 and 35 today, where Jesus says "A new command I give you that you love one another. "As I have loved you, you should love one another. "By this all men will know you are my disciples." That's why it's so important for us to be connected to like minded believers, doing life together, loving one another, sharing with one another, crying together, laughing. Was made up of Latin American students and we had a young man from Guatemala named Manuel. We called him Manny, who actually had been playing since his. Holy name. Jesus, amen. You're dismissed. Even if I'd stayed awake, I'm just not gonna get anywhere in big church. I need to find a way to pull back the curtain. You know we should get you guys in a small group. What's that? The pastor was talking about a small group open house they're having in a couple of weeks, actually. Had you stayed awake you would know. A small group is where a buncha people get together once a week to do Bible study and I think he said do life together. And they're forming all the new groups in a couple of weeks. Hmm. Almost like it was meant to be. Yeah, we was lucky. This wasn't luck, Vincent, this was divine intervention. You know I have a friend Julie. Her and her husband, they just joined this small group at their church and maybe I could talk to her, see if you guys could tag along, get your feet wet before you find a group of your own. Sign us up. Okay. Awesome. Scott? Yeah babe. Come here. What? Yep. How did you know you even needed a test? I'm late. And you take the pills. Yeah, I've been taking the pills, Scott. Other people get to be excited about this moment. Okay, let's just start over and choose to think positively. Easy for you to say. Come on, that's not fair. I'm sorry. Look, you, we will be fine. Come here. Come here. We do have a thing or two going on though, don't we? Yeah. Oh I still can't find my french press. Hi, what's up, Chief! Hey, how's that new puppy? We got a rabbit. Oh that's a great name, buddy, that's good. It's a different species. Hey, do you do much shootin'? I've played some laser tag. I was thinking you oughta come out to the range with us in the morning. Me and the guys got us some of those Obama bin Laden targets. We're gonna rip up that 150 yards, you're gonna talk about. Phew, whoo! Come on man. It's Osama bin Laden. What are you talkin' bout? How about a rain check? How bout that? That's my shoe. Yeah, that'll work, that'll work. But 223's about to get scarce. You gotta get some while you can. No idea what that is. Look, I'm trying to take out this trash. If I could just? - Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. - I got this. Hey I got ya, I got ya, I got ya. I'll call ya up. All right? I got ya down. We're gonna get Daryl. Daryl! Hey, what you doing in the morning, buddy? I got Cooter up and going. He's totally in some crazy right wing militia, isn't he? Oh totally. What's a chicken wing Melissa? It's a rooster army. Still on the french press hunt? Yes. I know we're a single income family now, but I can buy you a new one. No. I have had that one since college. I don't want a new french press. I want my french press. All right. Cori, my assistant. What's up? Hey, so you're good to go in the small group. Awesome, sweet. That was quick. Thank you. You still good to hang out with Casey? Yes. You're gonna have to find a real sitter next time though, Dad. Spoon full of sugar, Ms. Poppins. Okay, just so you know, small groups can be a little awkward while people are, you know getting to know each other. Can I help you? We're the Coopers. For the small group. Oh right, right, right. Come on in. Thanks. How's your week? It's good. Yours? Good. Work? Uh, it's good. That's good. What about you, how's your week? Good. Good. And you're probably gonna wanna warn Mary about the super moms. She's been getting up every hour and a half. I don't think I've slept since April. Oh, that's so tough. - Yeah. - That's horrible. You know when our baby was just two days old we prayed over her and she has slept through the night ever since. I mean what a miracle. Yeah. You ever been in a small group? Um, well uh, I was at a... Like a church small group? No, no. Ever? We have a daughter. Oh okay, so just the one so far? - Mm hmm, yeah. - Okay. We're happy with one. Okay. Are you okay? I mean. I know we don't all know each other that well, but I can just tell we're all gonna be best friends, Sam. Scott. Scott. And if you're lucky, you'll have one of those superhero Christians in your group. So we just put our house on the market. We feel like we've already led everyone to Christ in our neighborhood. So we wanna go to the inner city so we can reach more people there. I've got this rash. Wow. I'm getting nowhere. How am I gonna get these people to open up? You know show me some truth because if I don't, this thing crashes and burns. Okay, good talk. I'm gonna go have a PB&J. There she is. Casey, this is our new friend Lydia. She's gonna hang out with you for a little while while Mommy and Daddy go out. Okay? Pepper doesn't want you to go. She'll be scared. You know what Casey? I think Pepper's really cute. Daddy says she's a peer. Hey did you know we're neighbors? I live four houses that way. - You do? - Yeah. Wanna go see my room? Yeah, I'd love to. Thanks, Lydia. We'll be back in a couple of hours. - How's it going man? - Thank you. All right, thank you. - There's, yeah. - I know this guy. Hey man. Oh hey buddy, I'm Chaz. I know, Roman Cooper. Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. Ethan! Do you really know him? Pretty sure I know him. - Hey. - Hi. Do you offer childcare services? Yes, we have great information on the kiosk, right here. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Small group. Excuse me fellow. You know what, I didn't read that either. Don't worry about it. What's that? The brochure or the pamphlet or the e-mail. I didn't read any of them. Oh yeah, no me either. I was just looking at the pictures. Honestly I never learned how to read. Really? Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing. No, I would be embarrassed by that. No doubt at all. Yeah, did ride the short bus to school, but I at least learned to read. At a second grade level they tell me. I quit, you win. You know unfortunately I always win at awkward chicken. Yeah, it shouldn'ta gone there. But, sorry Lord, but anyway. Yeah. - Roman. - Shane. Good to meet, Roman huh? Yeah. So you guys should definitely come sit with us. I'd love to, yeah. Is this the lovely lady? This is her. I'm Shane, how are you? - Mary, nice to meet you. - Good to meet. She's even better looking that you are. We get that all the time. So listen, I was just telling Roman, we got an empty couple of seats at our table. We had a couple who, they're not with us anymore. Oh I'm sorry to hear that. No, no, they didn't die. They moved to Gainesville, Florida. So they're basically dead to me of course. But no, empty chairs. Come join us. - Sure. - Definitely. - Let's do it. - Let's do it, come on. We're a little late though, so. Jason, what's up man? Good to see ya brother. How's it going? - Hey. - Hey guys. Oh yeah, this is probably the best looking small group I've seen. Seeing y'all work, I like it. We're over here. All right, if I can get everybody's attention. I know you're excited to get into some fellowship there in your new small group. Psalm 55:14 says it was good when we walked together to the house of God. We wanna encourage you to walk together, pray together, do life together. Well that's enough preaching. Let's break the ice. Okay, well I'm excited everybody. I know it can be a lotta pressure sitting at a table full of people ya kinda know or barely know or don't know at all. You talking about us? I know this guy real well. We're best friend. He's coming over to help me move on Saturday. Shane, stop. I forgot, I sold the house. I don't blame you Hoss. - Right? - Well... I told y'all when y'all bought that place it was way too small. - There they go. - There it is. Please don't listen to anything that they say. Duly noted. - Okay. - Well before we start having too much fun, maybe we should go around the table and introduce ourselves. Honey, you wanna start? Okay. Hi, I'm Emily, Kenny's wife. We have three kids together. And we look forward to going on an adventure with all of you. I look forward to going on an adventure with you too, Emily. Thank you, Shane. Absolutely.

'Cause she's Asian? - Sorry. - Okay. It's your turn. - I'm sorry. - You know what, I'm gonna go ahead and go. My bad. I'm Shane Baxter. I am 38 years old, I'm a Pisces. This is my wife Emily. I'm definitely not his wife. - No? - I'm his wife. I'm Elise. I get them mixed up quite often. We have two beautiful kids. Three. - The third one though... - Three. You think he's beautiful? They're all beautiful. In the eyes of God. Yeah, stop. I don't even know if it's mine, to be quite honest with you. Okay Hoss, you done, you done. Okay. Hey everybody, my name is Robert. I used to play pro ball. Go Pack go! Now I'm a middle school P.E. teacher. And I coach football. And I am married to the love of my life, Ms. Monica. I shoulda said that. Hey y'all, I'm Monica and I'm just really excited about this group. Well I'm Deke and this is my lovely wife, Rebecca. And it's my mission in life to follow Jesus to the best of my ability and to lead as many people to him as possible. - Oh baby. - Amen. Amen. Thanks, Deke. So since we're not going in any particular order, let's here from Shane's new friends. Okay, I'm Roman Cooper and this is my awesome wife, Mary. Hi. Hey. More, I run a one man production company. Nothing super fancy, just promo stuff. And really excited to be a part of this. Roman though? You look like a Coop. We'll call you Coop, can we call you Coop? Roman sounds more biblical, right? Yeah, right? I say we call him Romy. My homey romy? My homey romy. You can't just change his name. Let's stick with Coop. Kenny, we good with Coop? Coop it is. - Gavel. - Coop. Yeah! Hey darlin' how you doin'? Yeah! Oh hey buddy. Hey wave that. Hey hold up one minute. Hey buddy, you don't mind do you, Chief? Okay. Whoo! Hey rev that sucker up man. Let's go before he invites us to redneck small group. I know. Mommy, Mommy, Pepper's gone. She's gone, she's gone. Whoa, slow down sweetie. Tell me what happened? She's not in her cage or my closet. Somebody took her. Come inside, come inside. Hey no, I'm sure she just wandered off. No, somebody took her. Listen sweetie, Daddy and I have to go. So we'll go to the grocery store on our way back, okay? And we'll pick up some carrots. And we'll put 'em out in the yard and then Pepper will come back to eat them. - Okay. - Okay honey? We'll be back soon. Hey Casey, do you wanna show me your Barbie house? - I guess. - Come on, let's go see it. Shiny, you just crawling up on. Bam! Think Billy eats rabbits? Nah. Come on, let's go. Hey guys. - Hi Dr. Hines. - Hey. So, how's everything? Well you are definitely pregnant. I am? Dang it. Sorry. How's the baby? Well so far so good. The tests look fine. That's great. So the questionnaire says this is your second pregnancy and your first baby was born premature. So everything was fine up until 31 weeks. I was at work, started having stabbing pains. So I went straight to the hospital and Casey was born later that night. They said I had a shortened cervix. So we'll definitely keep our eye on it. What are the chances that would happen again? It's a concern further on down the road, but right now you guys have a healthy, growing baby. That's great. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Mary, look. It doesn't mean it's gonna happen again. - Mm hmm. - Okay? I'm just scared, you know. Well you know, we don't have to move forward with the pregnancy. How could you even suggest that? I'm just saying that I don't like to see you in pain. I'm just saying that I don't like to see you in pain. And we have option at this time, at this moment, right now. Before... Look at that. Check it out. Mary. You have to take it back, Scott. I take it back, I take it way back. I'm sorry. Now will you look at this? Look at that swaddled little wet monkey. We could have another little choo choo like that. Another little baby to cuddle every single day. Another 8-10 poop diapers to take care of every single day. Are we, I don't know, stepping on sacred ground or something? What do you mean exactly? The small group. Do you think we're creating bad kharma? No. Of course not. One has nothing to do with the other. Sister Christian, this is a mansion. What did Shane say he does for a living? He owns a gutter company, but she made the money. Oh, sugar mama. Apparently she invented something and took it on that Lion's Den show. - Huh. - Got a big deal. What was it? Some kinda spy glasses I think. Are you serious? Yeah, I think. That's what she said. What, how long have you known this? I don't know what you're going to do. Relax, I'm kidding. She didn't say. Sometimes you're just funny, aren't you? Hey guys, the Coopers are here. Hey, I was wondering if we scared you off the other night. - Oh no. - What's going on man, how are you? Hey man, good. - Good to see you. - Sorry, the sitter ran late man. No it's okay, it's okay. It's a rookie mistake. We're gonna let it slide this once. Kenny, get over here and be a leader, come on. Hey Scott. What's the frequency, Kenneth? Ah, good to see you again. - Yes sir. - Coop, what's up man? Hey... - Deke. - Deke! That's right. What's your last name? Kailani. What does that mean exactly? Buried pig. 'Cause you're Hawaiian? I'm just joking. I don't know what it means. Okay. So, you ready to do small group? Yeah. We're excited but we don't know what to expect. Well you know Rebecca and I, we've been part of three small groups over the years. Uh huh. You want a good balance of fellowship and fun and time in the word. Time in the word. Something tells me we'll have no shortage of levity though. Oh. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm not fine. Help me up, Rob. Oh, she's famous. - No, I am not famous. - For what? Have you ever warn a pair of YADs? Oh I thought I recognized you. I totally saw you on the Lion's Den show. Told you she was famous. - No. - Mm hmm. We are very blessed that the product has become famous. Yoga All Day. Kenny, let's circle up man, come on. Lord, thank you for allowing us this opportunity to come together with a group of believers to study your word and just grow closer to each other and to you. In Christ's holy name we pray, amen. Amen. - Amen. - Well tonight, I thought it would be appropriate for us to introduce ourselves spiritually. How did we come to know Jesus. All right, so who wants to start? I'll go. You sure you're not too shy? Kenny, I'm trying to be serious if you could just... All right, please, please. Yeah, so I didn't grow up in church. I was the typical college frat rat. You know existed on beer and chicken wings. I don't apologize for the chicken wings. Have you had the chicken wings at Loco's? Yes. - Amen. - Oh yeah. I spent way too much time in bars shootin' bourbon and chasing girls. I think they were afraid of my natural charm and beauty. I'm sure that was it. I didn't scare you though. And that's the. Oh yes you did. I didn't scare you off. Best thing that ever happened to me because after we get married, God brought someone close to us whom I think we both needed at the time. Someone who lived with, how do we say it, I got peace. Yeah, he's talking about my cousin, Sam. He's a missionary. I asked Sam, you know, 'cause there was something just different about him, like, "Dude, what is it about you?" And he just says, "Buddy, it's Jesus." We talked for like three hours that night about that. And under normal circumstances any other night I'm not gonna have that conversation. I was above it. But for some reason that night, you know God opened my heart. And we prayed at the end of it and I gave my life to Jesus. And it's been a free man ever since. - Amen. - Amen. I've actually met Sam and he is a humble servant of God. Terrible singer though. I mean he couldn't carry a tune in an iPod. We all have our faults, Shane. Well let's do something a little bold now. Instead of delaying the inevitable, I think that maybe we should ask our small group rookies here to share your spiritual journey with us. So Roman, oh I'm sorry, Coop, would you like to start? Sure. Yeah okay. Well you know I grew up in a pretty religious family. Went to church almost every Sunday. I was saved when I was nine years old. And as far as my relationship with Jesus now, I... I've always just relied on the fact that if I follow him wholeheartedly I will reject sin and embrace love, pure and true grace. They flow from God through us to others. Coop that was beautifully said man. Yeah. Amen. Oh you like those? I took those. Yeah I had no idea you were such a fine photographer. No I took 'em from an old lady. She was blind, I, sorry Lord. Get outta my house. It's kinda weird that you're lingering. Oh your place is like a museum man. Nah. Okay, I wanted to show you this video. Yeah no everybody goes to church. Not me, not the demon. Deacon. We're a local band. We're gonna be playing next Thursday at the loading docks at Winn Dixie. Y'all come on out. Too much. Shane would love the Elza Bubba. I gotta invite this guy to small group. What's up? You cool? Yeah, I'm fine. All right. Such a person's praise is not from other people. But from God. Romans chapters one and two. Thanks Deke. So there's a lot going on in these first two chapters. Aren't there? You've got Paul who once he gets past his greetings, goes into a discussion about all the sinful things that can incite God's wrath. But then in chapter two he turns the tables a little bit. Anybody know what he does? - I do. - Yep. My granny told me about this years ago. In chapter one when Paul was like, "I done told y'all about doing that stuff, mm hmm." "It makes the Lord very, very angry." Paul came alone in chapter two and yanked that rug right from up under him saying, "Don't be thinking because you're doing good "that you better then them folks who ain't." "No siree, don't you do it." Shane if you don't mind, I have a question for the group. I notice here on chapter two verse one it says, "Therefore you have no excuse", "oh man, whoever you are, "when you judge another for in passing judgment upon him" "you condemn yourself." You know why is it that we as Christians are so obsessed with judgment? You're right Coop, we're all sinners. Scripture makes it very clear that it's not our job to cast stones. We are to love just as Christ loved. But, some may make the claim that you know we're not to judge sin itself, right? That anything goes. That's just plain moral relativism. And there's no scriptural justification for that. The way I read it, Paul says that sins are toxins. And we're to be cleansed by the blood of Christ and view others through a prism of love and kindness rather than as personifications of their sins. Beautifully said Deke. In fact he said it way better than you did. - I agree. - Kenny, you're off the throne. Deke it's your show now brother. I second that emotion. Nah Kenny, you're the big kahuna bro. Kenny, I think we're gonna have to kick you outta the group. You're not outta the group. - No? - No. Okay so with the time we have left I think we should talk about the details of Shane and Robert's big trip they got coming up. The guys' weekend. - Yeah, right. - Oo. You see, they have these latches on the side. So when you're done doing yoga or just laying around the house and you wanna go out in public, you just take a skirt, latch it onto your pants and voila. Yoga All Day. Oh wow. Elise is pretty clever, huh? Can't believe I haven't figured that out. Well what's wrong? I'm starting to feel guilty. Oh don't. I think that Ballard may actually have a point. I mean you've seen the way Shane pops off. Like you pop off? Well okay but I'm not the one claiming moral superiority here. Is Shane? Yeah actually. We were in the kitchen. And he claimed moral superiority? He was probably joking. But we don't know. We're fine, look everything's cool. - Okay. - And we gotta do what we gotta do, okay?

Man, I saw her out here playing. I figured kids like pets, so I thought I'd bring Ralph over to meet her. Billy, please take that thing away. Oh he ain't gonna hurt nothing. He eats rabbits. Not little girls. Billy, can you just take Ralph back over to your house? Yeah man, of course. Man I truly did not mean to scare her. I am so sorry. Honest mistake. - My bad. - It's okay. Coop, whoa Coop. Is that you, Shane? Okay. What are you handling snakes now? We're Pentecostals now. Yeah, that's not the way we roll. Come on, let's go camping, come on. Great, okay. Be right there. Yeah, what kinda household are you running? I think Ralph ate Pepper. I bet you're right. Listen honey, you go on. I got this, all right? Cool. The things you do for me.

Hey, thanks man. Absolutely. Anything for you brother. Here's your receipt. That actually worked? Huh? The card, it went through? Yes sir. Huh. I guess no one's reported Shane Baxter missing yet. Won't be a problem much longer. We're gonna go kill him. Have a blessed day. Thank you ma'am. We're actually a church group. Hi. Can I see your receipt, sir? Sure. Oh you on your own now, Hoss. You have a blessed day. Guys, guys! Shane Baxter Jr. that is not what we do with bubbles. He's just like his father. You should absolutely do it. Do you think it would fly around here? Oh definitely. Do it, sister. Are we still talking about the yoga studio? Yeah. Mary, if that is the direction that God is taking you, go for it. In fact, I know a great commercial agent I can introduce you to. Are you talking about John? John is fabulous. He looks like he's 12 years old, but he's great. Maybe. Maybe when the time is right. Elise, you could maybe even open a YADs store at Mary's studio. You know that's not a bad idea. Really? I would love that. I'm so jealous of you two. Man I just don't think I would have the guts to open my own business. But sure, I'll be your first member. That would be good. Thank you. What you doing over there? Making pencils? Naw man, I'm making spears for tiny zombies. They infest these woods. What are you doing? Setting up a super sweet time lapse shot. I'm gonna throw it over there in that field. We'll see the sun go down, the night sky and constellations spin, and then the sun rise again. Like a slowmo kinda thing? No, like a time lapse. So if I were to like go Coop's a dork in front it it would be like Coop's a dork? - Oh yeah. - Like that. How's that lip holy field? This one?

Dude, you should go see my Lasik guy. I got Lasik a couple years ago. Best decision I ever made. I'm gonna go make some more squirrel spears. We're gonna have dinner. Hang on. That was close. You know all three of mine went to Rocky Branch. Casey's gonna love it. That makes me feel a lot better. Thank you. Yeah, our kids loved Rocky Branch. Though we decided to homeschool this year. Homeschool? How do you have time for that? Don't you run a huge company? Well... She sold out to her boyfriend. And her husband signed off on it. That is not true. I still own the patent. I mean we sold the production side but not to, he's not my, I don't. She gets all flustered when you mention Bob. The guy from the Lion's Den? Sweet Bobby Bob. Mary is new to this group. She doesn't understand how you tease. I tease like her husband. That's why she loves me. Bob is a very dear friend of ours, both Shane and mine. And he went through such a hard time last year when his marriage ended. And I just, it makes it doubly inappropriate for you to... You're right, you're right, Elise. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be joking like that. Let it be known we're all 100% committed to our marriages. Amen. And, we're all blessed to be married to godly men. Yes, isn't that true. Mary. Go ahead and get buckled up sweetie. - Okay. - Hey. Hey, are you a coffee drinker? Until I find my french press I can't consider the sludge I have been drinking real coffee. But yeah. We should go have a coffee. Just us. I would love that. I just figured since we were the newbies in the bunch and... Right. Gotta look out for each other. Yeah. So I'll send you a text, then I'll check my shift schedule at work. That sounds great. Awesome. God bless. God bless you too. Guys I just wanted to come out here, stars in perfect view. And just pause. We live our busy lives overwhelmed by the day by day. We get to come out here, clear our heads and be humbled by the incomprehensible scope of God's creation. We're insignificant. Yet for some reason he loves us individually. How can I be anything but grateful? Amen to that, my brother. Fire's going pretty good now. Hey, look at this. Guys, whoo! Get some dogs on here to cook.

I don't know. Now what do I do? Would you like to say a few nice things about Pepper? Dear God, please take care of Pepper if she's in heaven with you or still in Ralph's tummy. Pepper was a sweet rabbit and she likes to be held most of the time. But she will pee on you, so be careful. And at least take her out three time, four times a day. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. I love you. That's good. Robert. Hey man, how you doing? Aw man, not too bad for a beat up old lineman with the spine of a 60 year old. You sound like you're in pain. Yeah, I'll live. But I ain't gonna be getting on no airplane no time soon. What about your mission trip? Man look it, I'm just hoping I can make it to the bathroom. Well I'm sorry to hear that man. Let me know if there's anything I can do for ya. Yeah, how bout you go in my place? Me go to Guatemala? You're my homie, Romy. I need you to do this. Why me? Look man, get your video gear, get a little footage, put together a promo piece for the mission. It's all paid for, no problem. Okay, um. Listen, just pray on it. These Oxycontin's kicking in man. And I'm about to start slobbing. So I'ma holler at you a little later, all right? God bless. Take care man. Guatemala? Guatemala. It's gold, it's gold. Yeah, you're right. I mean I'll have to postpone some interviews but it will definitely bring a lotta production value to the documentary. And add perspective. Totally. Okay, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna grab some footage of those kids digging for food out of a dump and then you're gonna contrast that with these blessed bunch a do gooders running up to those very same kids handing 'em freaking Bibles. Oh this is. Go. Go to Guatemala. You guys should come and stay with us while the boys are away. It's very tempting, but Casey and I like to get some girl time any time Scott leaves. You know? Scott? - Roman. - Oh. Scott's his middle name. Oh. So how is Casey handling the bunny situation? - Pretty well. - Good. Yeah, does it make me a horrible person to admit that I actually enjoyed the memorial service? No. Good, 'cause I did. And she was adorable. I couldn't believe what a grown up she was, you know? Yeah. She actually prayed that was, took me off guard. Why? Well you know it's like such an adult thing to do. Mary I've been thinking about something. Are you a believer? I mean I go to the small group, I'm in this. I'm just asking. Not gonna change the way I feel about you. No. But please don't tell Roman. He doesn't know? No he knows, he just wouldn't want me telling you. - You know? - No. I wouldn't. How do you feel about all this Jesus stuff? How do you feel? - Coop. - Hey man. How's it going, brother? - Good. - Good. This looks good. Did you go see my guy? What? Lasik. You're not wearing your little nerd specs. Looks good, I like it. Oh it's contacts. Ah, either way, either way it works for me. I was afraid we weren't gonna get beat up down there with your little professor look. Hey, I gotta talk to the pilot real quick. Have you guys met? - Yeah. - All right. Be right back. Yeah, hey man. Hey buddy, I'm Chaz. Really? You're being serious. Yeah, I am. My name's actually Chaz. I'm Chaz too. No way. Chaz too? How have we never met? Bro, this is Chaz too! After you brother, go ahead. This is great, man. Yeah, oh, we should immortalize this moment. Whoa, Hollywood. That's a nice rig, man. - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah. Cheers, all right. Oh Shane, I see you're really roughing it on this private jet on our way to the mission trip. Well look now, in all fairness, just for the record, this is Rob's old team's owner's son's plane. They leant it to us. He's too big to fly commercial. You know listen candidly, we're about to spend a week in the filthy slums of Guatemala City, pretending to give a crap all these little street kids. I feel like we owe it to ourselves to treat ourselves like royalty before we stoop beneath our station. Wait, that was awful. I should never, right? That was terrible. Sorry Lord. I laughed. Oh anyway, cheers. - I'm glad you laughed. - Cheers. You need me to hold that champagne for ya? No, this is sparkling grape juice. You know no drinking on a mission trip. Okay? But yeah, yeah, you can hold that for me. Seatbelts all buckled? Everybody ready to go? What's up man? Welcome to Guatemala City boys. How are you? I'm doing well. There you go. Thank you so much. There he is. Heard a lot about you. All right. Tell me a little bit more about Engadi. Engadi's a boy's center, right? And before you say anything, we're not ignoring the girls, man. The truth of the matter is, Coop, the girls aren't the problem around here, man. It's these boys, right? It's these boys who are growing up into angry young men who rape, who kill, who father babies they have no intention of supporting. Right, they're forcing these girls into prostitution and poverty. Engadi's desire is to reach these boys at a young age. To love them, educate them, feed them. To more importantly, introduce them to the loving and saving grace of Jesus Christ. If we can do that, not only do we change the life of that boy, but we also change the life of every female he will ever meet. And that is the mission of Engadi Ministries. Oh Guatemala. Hey, what's up guys? How are you? Whoo hoo! Hola, hola. Selfies for everybody. Selfie. Hey! Yeah, all right. What'd he say? We're going to the soccer field, Chaz. You see the boy in the red? - Yeah. - It's Christiano. Until you have enough, you feel free to cut brother. Whoa. Hey Coop, I got something you're gonna wanna see, man.

Yeah I guess. I don't think you'da been safe out there by yourself. Mm mm. I think you're right. Yeah, I am right. You want an orange? Yeah, thanks. Your vitamin C replenished. Yo Carlos, you got any more oranges in that bag? We have teams constantly working here. Teams picking up trash all day every day.

Thank you. Doctor Hines. Mr. Cooper. How's Mary? She's gonna be all right. We've given her meds to help her rest. And the baby? Come with me. She's a girl. She's fighting hard right now. But she doesn't have much time left. Look Scott, I want you to go on in and be with Mary for a few minutes, okay? And then we're gonna bring her in so you can hold her. Hold her? I can't. It's important for you to hold your baby. I just can't. It's a miracle that she's even still with us. I can't even explain it. It's as if she was waiting on you. She was waiting on you, Scott. Okay. ♪♪ Empty dresses, frills and bows ♪♪ ♪♪ Round and round and round we go ♪♪ No hair. ♪♪ Empty dresses, frills and bows ♪♪ ♪♪ All fall down like dominoes ♪♪ ♪♪ Empty dresses, frills and bows ♪♪ ♪♪ Round and round and round we go ♪♪ Hey kid. Are you sure you're ready to get back at it? Scotty, I know you're angry. It's okay. I just hope your aim is right. Listen, I saw the footage. Yeah, you've been praying a lot with your friends. Tell me, why wasn't he listening? Oh I know they'll say that he never turns his back on you and God is good all the time. Right? Well answer me this. Who would they have given credit to if she'd survived? Don't waste your suffering, buddy. Use it. God never said that we wouldn't suffer. And in fact he said that we would. But he also said that we can turn to him and his grace will heal us. I don't deserve grace. Yeah, but none of us do. That's the point, right? Look, I just bring it back to the cross. When he was up there looking down on all of those soldiers that were torturing him, he prayed to God, he begged God to show them grace. Look, I know that you're blaming yourself for whatever you think you did wrong. But one has nothing to do with the other. God shows grace. You just have to ask for it. Hey. Have you seen it? Seen what? I'll send you the link. I'm trying to track the snake down now. - Who? - Ballard. I'm gonna kill him. Beyond the friendly exterior of your local house of worship, hidden cameras reveal the shocking, hypocritical truth about the modern church and its members. Oh no no, I took 'em from an old lady. She was blind. The vast majority of all mankind to hell. I sniff it to get high. I like to geek up, pass out and pee myself. Oh she sold out to her boyfriend. And her husband signed off on it. Filthy slums of Guatemala City pretending to give a crap about all these little street kids. We owe it to ourselves to treat ourselves like royalty before we stop beneath our station. Beneath our station. "Undercover in the House of Hypocrites". Coming this fall. I can't watch this again. We brought this on ourselves, Scott. I wish we'd never left California. We never should've taken Ballard's money and we shouldn't have betrayed these people. I don't think I had a choice. It's my fault. - No, no. - I pushed you into taking it, I know. You didn't. Ballard came to me. Mommy? Are you and Daddy fighting 'cause you miss Baby Callie? No sweetie. I'm sorry. It's okay Mommy. Babe look, I'm gonna make this right. How? Why are you still wearing those? Babe, trust me. I really think you should take those things off. We gotta tell the whole truth. Oh I know you did not just walk up in this house. What are you doing here? Shane, don't. It ain't worth it, Hoss. Why would you pretend to be my friend? Shane I didn't. Guys, the video you saw, it was not me, okay? It was my producer. And that was a hack job. I mean, that doesn't matter. I'm just, I feel so bad. I'm really sorry. This is invasive. What did we ever do... Wait, wait guys. We gotta do this right. They're still part of this small group so let's everybody just grab a seat and let's talk this thing out. Well, these glasses are how I collected the footage. But if you don't mind, I'd like to record this. Why? The world needs to know the truth and this is our chance, our chance to set the record straight. I got nothing to hide. You guys? The level of deception required to do something like this. I don't know how we move forward from that as friends. Or as business partners. It hurts. But God didn't punish you for this, Mary. What confuses me a little is that you came back. I mean why? I feel like I gave Buddy Holly that seat. You and Shane going after that little girl. You not being here when your baby girl was. I told you that none of us deserve his grace. But he offers it anyway. You have been a guest in my house. And you've played with my kids. Y'alls pain was our pain too. We shared it with you and gave it to God. But then, this. I just, I don't know man, I just don't know. This is stupid. I mean you're right, it's a hack job. And it's too ridiculous to even get mad at. But seeing yourself like this, I mean it kinda makes you think about how you're perceived. I get it. Look, I mean, it's not cool to follow Jesus. And you found you a buncha targets, right? Congratulations. But I think, I think God's working on you. But you lost a little girl. But you saved one down in Guatemala. And you pulled her outta the slum. Robert, I'm sorry, I reject the idea that you put Coop on that plane. God put you on that plane. This was his plan. You can mock that if you want, but that's what I believe. I think he's working on you. I think you accidentally let him in. I had no idea you were such a talented editor. Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't start whining. I did you a favor. Look, you are trending. 47 hours of footage, some of it really, really powerful stuff and that's what you cherry picked. Yeah well man, you were the clever editor that put all the best stuff in a folder labeled sorry Lord. This is total bull... This is what people need to know. The people, they're not gonna buy this. This is trash, it's cheap garbage, man. Oh no, no, no 'cause the people are stupid. They feed on outrage and they wanna be told what to think. So what better target for their outrage than the church, man? What is your beef with these people? What is my beef with these people? Well, their entire religion is a lie. You just do whatever you want, yeah take a picture, invade my privacy. Have a beer on me, but just if ya hit anybody, ya kill anybody, it's okay because you can just pray to Jesus and make everything all better. You know what, you think that you can dump all your sins out on Jesus because you've taken the official pledge. Well, real life doesn't work like that. The things that you've done, you've done. What have you done? God, it's Mary. Look, all this religion stuff makes me uncomfortable and makes you not feel real. I wanted to believe that were punishing me for my lies. I wanted to blame you. But I'm getting that's not how this works. I read every one of Jesus' words last week, twice. And I get it. I get why people would follow him. But, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that if I said yes to something that I'm not entirely sure is true I would be living a lie and I cannot do that. I'm sorry, but I don't have the strength to forgive people who would crucify me. No one does. That's not natural. From God through others to me. Grace. I give up, Coop. I felt from the beginning that this thing would crash and burn. And I guess I convinced myself that it was okay to lie if I got closer to the truth. And in a way I did. But I also violated a group of people who know they're not perfect, but they live for something so much bigger than themselves. ♪♪ Lord take me back Hey man. Coop, good to see you, buddy. ♪♪ I've wandered away ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm your long, lost son ♪♪ ♪♪ I've gambled my life ♪♪ ♪♪ Lost more than I could say ♪♪ ♪♪ So Lord take me back ♪♪ Hey, I'm Chaz. - Cori. - Cori did you say? Yeah. Are you meeting anybody? No. Do you wanna sit with me? Sure. So here's the thing. I regret what I've done. But, I don't regret going through it. Because I got to know people like Sam. And here's a guy who seems to have let go of his own crap. And does his best to let Jesus just live through him for the good of these children. Kids like Carlos who live in a world of sin, fueled by sin. But Sam and his staff, they don't just provide basic needs. They show their boys that by fulfilling their most basic need, a relationship with a God who desires them, they're armed to face a world that doesn't. ♪♪ Can we sing amen ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh Lord, let's sing it again ♪♪ ♪♪ Lord take me back to my home ♪♪ So now the question I have to ask myself is, what do I believe? ♪♪ Amazing grace ♪♪ I believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God.

Scott and Mary have actually added to their family if you'll give your attention to the screen, you'll see these three beautiful children that they've chosen to support, giving them shelter and clothing. Give it up for the Coopers. Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Making a maze. Who would that be? That's good. Look what I'm drawing. A turtle. Oh Casey. Casey! Pepper! I thought you were in Ralph's tummy. I missed you so much, Pepper. Billy, how did you? I was just cleaning my bike and I see something hopping along and I thought, yeah that's it. So I grabbed her. Thank you, Billy, for everything. Yes ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Billy. You're welcome sweetheart. You're an awesome neighbor, Billy. Aw, back at ya. Cooter. Cooper. We all missed Pepper, didn't we? Aw. Unbelievable. The amazing, vanishing, peeing Pepper. That reminds me. Are you so happy, honey? - Um hmm. - Aw. The brand new french press. Thank you. No thank you. I missed you so much. You ready, partner? - Let's do it. - Okay. Don't forget your shoes. Jiminy Christmas. Just a little off the top, Shane. I feel like I'm a little shaky here. Oh really? Got some right here. Hey guys. I said a little. Are you ready to go? Here we go. Two, one. Little sparcer. Yay, cut it, cut it. Yay! Whoo hoo! All right. This is amazing. What a day! Plank, exhale into Chaturanga. No, no, no. Big black man don't plank or chimichanga. Not to mention I got to poo real bad. My stomach been hurting all day. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I quit. I quit, I've seen this movie before. It doesn't end well. Did Deke tell you about it? It's got a mushroom cloud. All right y'all, I hate to be all R. Scott Cooper on you, but we gotta document this moment. Pull it in. That's what I'm talking about. These are my friends. Pretty.
