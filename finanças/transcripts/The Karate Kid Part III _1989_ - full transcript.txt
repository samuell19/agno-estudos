Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Defeat does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Defeat does not exist in this dojo. Does it? No, Sensei! Prepare! We do not train to be merciful here. Mercy is for the weak. Here, on the street, in competition, a man confronts you, he's the enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy. What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence? Class, we have visitors. I hear you jumped some of my students last night. Afraid the facts mixed up. Now you get your boy on the mat or you and I will have a major problem. Too much advantage, your dojo. Name a place. Tournament. Come on, Johnny, kill him! Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso! Time out, time out. Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel. Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff! Sweep the leg. You have a problem with that? No, Sensei. No mercy. Warning for illegal contact to the knees. - Ready? - Finish him. No mercy! No mercy! Weigh the fist, Johnny. Finish him! Winner! Now, who's the loser? You know, you're really sick, man. How does second place feel now? - Come on, he can't breathe. - Mind your business. You're gonna kill him. Sensei, please. You're hurting him. He's sorry, okay? He really is. Oi. Let him go. Beat it, slope, or you're next. "Mercy is for the weak. "We do not train to be merciful here. "A man face you, he is enemy. "Enemy deserve no mercy. " Come, Daniel-san. Time to go home. You could have killed him, couldn't you? Hai. Why didn't you then? Because, Daniel-san, for person with no forgiveness in heart, living even worse punishment than death. Sensei Kreese, this is Pat Johnson from the All Valley Tournament calling you again. Look, we're sorry you lost all your students. I guess the Cobra Kai won't be entering the tournament this year. As you know, we've made repeated requests for payments of dues but since you've failed to respond, we really have no choice but to drop the Cobra Kai from our membership rolls. If you have any questions, give me a call, huh? Have a nice day. Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell. This is the final call regarding your bill, and if you do not pay immediately... Oh, Mr. Kreese, good morning. What a surprise. Some coffee? Where's the boss? He's upstairs. Thanks. Come on! You're telegraphing that wheel kick. Hey, hey! Johnny! Johnny, Johnny! What a surprise, man! Yes! What's this? You moving in? This is "I give up. " I came to say good-bye. Here are the dojo keys. What are you talking about? I'll pay you that back rent as soon as I can. Screw the rent. What, you think I bought that place for the rent? I bought it for you. - Mr. Silver? - What? The plutonium deal. Johnny, every business has a slump at one time or another. Look at this. Ten years ago, nuclear was the preferred waste. You could dump it anywhere. Now, everybody's a detective. I'm lucky if I make one deal a year without being indicted. Thank you. Come on, let's get some air. It's been nine months since I've had a student walk through my doors. Hey, you're not listening to me. Come on, snap out of it. I can't. I'm broke and I'm going nowhere. You're wrong. You're going to Tahiti. Now. All right, all right, I've heard enough. I've made up my mind. This slope, what's his name, Miyagi, and that punk kid... I'm gonna get them for what they did to you. They made you suffer, so I'm gonna make them suffer. And suffer and suffer. And when I think they've suffered enough, then I start with the pain. Look Terry, you don't have to do that. Don't have to? I want to. It's not over. We're Cobra Kai. Come on, say it. Cobra Kai. Say it! Cobra Kai. - Never dies. - You bet your ass. - I owe you, man. - You don't owe me anything. Oh, bullshit! I don't owe you anything? What about Vietnam, huh? How many times did you save my ass? I don't know. I lost count. Get the hell out of here. Have a good trip, Captain. The White Zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. Ah, smog! Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi? Daniel-san, why mother not here to meet you? You tell her right flight number? Oh, yeah. I told her the right flight. I just told her the wrong day. I told her we were coming in tomorrow. She loves surprises. Hope so. We take taxi, apartment house. Then Miyagi go back to work. 106 Los Angeles. Crank it up! What are you two clowns doing in my cab? Your cab? We just came from the airport. I thought that was the cab I ordered. Mrs. Milo, what's going on here? What does it look like? Progress. I got a message for you from your mother. Didn't I tell you, that bum would sell the place, huh? Didn't I tell you you'd be out of a job one of these days? - You wouldn't listen to me. - Hai. - What's the message? - What message? The one from my mother. She said call her collect at your Uncle Louie's. Nah, nah, nah. No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso. Daniel-san room all finished. Yeah, I take good care of him. You just look out Uncle Louie. You know, I might be here for a few months. A 70-year-old man gets emphysema, it's no joke, you know. Are you sure there's no problem for him to stay with you? No problem. Pleasure. Mr. Miyagi, thank you. Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-san. Nice mama. Yeah, mom. You sure, you don't need me there? No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi and start college. I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man. " When's registration? It's this Tuesday. And classes start Thursday. And when is Kumiko arriving? Uh, she's um... She's not. She got this great job with a dance company in Tokyo and I guess she just couldn't say no, so... Oh, honey. You're disappointed, huh? Yep. But that's life, I guess. I'll survive. You'll do more than just survive. I gotta go, okay? Listen, Uncle Louie says hi, and I love you. Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie. I love you, too. Bye-bye. The little maple's still in there. I'll get it. No. I go. Mr. Miyagi, you okay? Hai. Just remembering. I'll bet there are a lot of memories here for you, huh? So, what are you going to do now? Don't know. Hey, did you ever think about opening a bonsai store? Hai, Daniel-san. In my dream. My retirement. Well, what do you call this? Call "time to go. " Oi. You know, I've been thinking about the bonsai shop idea. You already have all the stock. How hard can it be? Not too hard, Daniel-san. If Miyagi have money for lease, deposit, fix-up. But since we build house for Yukie in Okinawa, money very short supply. "Supply"? Supplies are us. Huh? Thank you, Daniel-san, but that not money. It looks like money. Smells like money. Good money. Smell that. Smell like college education. I know that, Mr. Miyagi, but I have a great idea... Uh-uh-uh. Daniel-san. No idea. Discussion closed. But what about your dream? And, Mr. Miyagi, no offense, but you know, if you miss the train this time, there may not be another one for a long, long time. Then Miyagi take bus. Revenge? Of course you want revenge. Who wouldn't? I'm gonna get it for you. The day you step off the plane, you're the biggest dojo operator in the valley. What do you mean? What are you talking about? I bought 20 locations today. Yours, 100%. You are back, my man, bigger and badder than ever. You're a sweetheart, that's great! But what about those two jerks? Those two jerks are taking up 100% of my time from now on. So just have patience, my friend. I'm just getting things rolling. When I'm finished with that kid, he'll be begging me to be his teacher. And you know what he's gonna learn from me? Pain in every part of his body and fear in every part of his mind. And here's the kicker. He's gonna thank me for it. What about the old man? Him I hurt through the kid. Johnny, by the time that little twerp steps into the ring to defend his title, I'm gonna have him thinking he's invincible. Then he's gonna find out what pain and fear really mean. Right in front of a thousand people. How do you know he'll compete? He'll compete. Don't worry about it. You just have fun. Go give Mimona and her girlfriend a squeeze for me. How do you know about Mimona? I know. Anything else you want? Yeah. Make his knuckles bleed. Hey... Hey, I like that. I like that, Johnny! I'm gonna use that! Margaret, I'm going to be working full-time on this from now on. Full time. Very good, sir. No, no, no. It's too nice. I gotta look poor. This isn't bad. Fix the collar. Make me look humble. And about the Borneo call, sir? All right, but that's the last one. For the next few weeks, my business is strictly revenge. Everything is in place, sir. All right, let's see what you've got for me. Cute but wrong. It's got no character. A truck. Yeah. - Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs. - Yes, sir. Where are the magazines, I ordered? Right here, sir. Have a very pleasant evening, sir. Thank you, Margaret. "Karate's bad boy. "Mike Barnes. " Perfect. Mr. Miyagi, I'm home. Oh, Daniel-san, just in time. Hey. How was fishing? We find out pretty soon. So, how first day at college? College? College... College is... Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi. It's a place that I didn't go to today. What? Mr. Miyagi, may all your dreams come true. What this? There's only one way to find out. All right, I'll tell you. It's my college diploma. What? I'm only joking. Daniel-san, you have sense humor. "Lease. " For your new bonsai store. Congratulations. "One month security, two month rent. " Yes. With just enough left over for renovations, if we're careful. Oh Daniel-san, thank you very much, but cannot accept. But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi. Why not? Because money in pocket was not for Miyagi dream. Was for college education. Yeah, I know, just listen to me for a minute, okay. I know me. Okay, I just can't take courses to take courses. You know, I'll get bored and once that happens, forget about it. You know, it's bye-bye college. Hey I've been going to school non-stop since I'm five. I could use the break. - I don't know, Daniel-san. - Yeah, well, I do. - Just come with me a second. - Where? - Come on, just come with me. - What about fish? The fish will be fine. It's not going anyplace. That fish is dead. What a moment! What a moment! You are now crossing over to the right side of the tracks. Oh, what that? That's opportunity knocking. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Right up there. This is your dream come true, and there's plenty of free parking. It's right here, right here, Mr. Miyagi. - This place? - You bet this place. Wait till you see it up close. So, is this the opportunity of a lifetime or what? Huh? Now, I know what you're thinking. You're worried about this area. But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, the landlord says this neighborhood is up and coming. I believe her too. We're in on the ground floor over here. Look! Look what we got. A pottery shop across the street. Maybe we could set a deal, you know, get some planters made up for the bonsai. Wait till you see inside, man. This is going to be great. This is going to be great. Hey, come on in. Come on in. Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream. Huh? Now don't let this throw you. Okay? Looks can be deceiving. We have to think potential here. Think potential, all right? You see all this stuff? Everything in here? You own it. Everything. It's all yours. I mean, you could use this stuff. This is good wood. This is good material. We can make shelves out of this stuff. And back here, right, I thought this would be a great spot, up here, right, to do like a bonsai display. All those pine trees you have? We could show them in different stages. I mean, the possibilities are endless. It's endless. Here, hold the lease. Listen, over here, right, I thought this would be a great spot for a little work area. And over here we could have, like a bonsai hospital. You know, the little guys get sick. Take care of them. And I work for free. I thought of a name. I even thought of a name. Check it out. "Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees. " Simple, direct, catchy. I'm telling you, it doesn't look it now, but this place is a gold mine. I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi. If anyone can, you can. What? What did I do? Did I forget something? Hai. Well, what did I miss? Your name on lease, next to mine. Partner. Partner? Partner! Yes! Oh, Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great. Uh-uh-uh. Daniel-san. Arigato. You're welcome. What? Don't bullshit me. What do you mean you can't dump it in Borneo? Who in Borneo knows what chloride sludge is? Just do it! Do it! Call me when it's dumped. Where were we, Margaret? "And, in conclusion, I reject your final offer. "If you proceed, I will sue your collective asses accordingly. " "Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely, blah blah blah. " Yeah? Oh, good. Bring him in. What else? The grand jury. What do you intend to do about them? Bribe them, as usual. - Mr. Silver... - Lighten up, Margaret. Who's the DA on the case? Mr. Cole. Oh, good. Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night. And let's make sure we have his favorite. What is it? Uh, poached salmon. - Very well. - Mr. Silver? Well, you must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA. All right, listen. Thank you for bringing me down, Mr. Silver. Milos, call the boys. This place is intense. Consider it home. Thanks. Snake, Dennis. Mike Barnes. Dennis will take care of your training. Snake takes care of everything else. If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA, Snake's the boy to be bad with. Right, Snake? You know it. You get a weekly draw and a car. Any questions? Remember on the phone you said that if I come down here and I beat this, uh... LaRusso kid in the All Valley Tournament, that you'd give me 25% ownership in your new dojos? - Uh-huh. - Which I think is more than generous. But I've been giving it some thought. For me to do my absolute best, which is what I want to do for you, I'm afraid I'm gonna need 50%. Ooh, 50%*? Well, I don't know if I can afford more than 35. I understand. I guess I'd better get going. It was nice meeting everybody. Hey! Do you fight as hard as you negotiate? Harder. You got your 50%. And I get that in writing? By noon today. Mr. Silver. You just bought yourself a champion. You remember that. Snake, show him to his room. Yes, sir. Mike. See you later, Mike. Milos, my blue pinstripe. So, what do you think? Oh, he's obnoxious. Yeah, he's perfect. Ah. Ah, Daniel-san. Very good. This make special bonsai. - You really see a bonsai in here, huh? - Hai. Where? Inside. Inside? Hello, any bonsai in here? Daniel-san, not inside. Inside you. Same place your karate come from. But my karate comes from you. Only root karate come from Miyagi. Just like bonsai choose own way grow because the root is strong. You choose own way. Do karate same reason. Yeah, but I do it your way. Hai. One day, you do own way. Remember what you said before about bonsai being free to grow as they choose? All bonsai aren't free to choose. I mean, we tell them how to grow by using clippers and then the wire. Hai. But, Daniel-san, our bonsai not true bonsai. True bonsai grow wild. Very rare. - You ever seen any? - Hai. Okinawa. What about here? I only know of one. What did it do, immigrate? With Miyagi. Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa. Where's the tree now? There. Devil's Cauldron. - Devil's Cauldron? - Hai. No can see bonsai from here. Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother. Why did you put it in such a hard place to get to? True original bonsai worth many thousand dollar. Wow! Come, time learn special Miyagi-family kata. Now you ready. Like all bonsai found in tree, all karate found in this kata. Come, together we do kata. - Hi, Mr. Miyagi. - Hi. Hey, I brought over this tree. You know, the one you were working on this morning. I figured you might want to give it another try. Oh, thank you. I thought a change of scenery might bring what's inside outside, huh. Where should I put it? Over here, okay. Very good, Daniel-san. You've done a lot of work here. This place - is bigger than I thought. - Yeah. There's your charcoal. Thank you. Oh, perfect. Listen. I hope you don't mind but, um... I opened that letter. You know, the one that came today from the All Valley Tournament. There's a new rule this year. Would you like to read about it? No. That's okay because I got it memorized. It says, "Under the new rules, "the defending champion only needs to fight in the final match. " Isn't that great? That's one fight. That limits my fights to just one. That's better than what I had to put up with last year. Right? Hai. And let's face it, it's another year. It's a year later. I'm a lot more experienced, right? Hai. So I think we should seriously reconsider this. - Right? - Wrong! Wrong? Should consider get new pot for bonsai. You know, I don't know what the big deal is. - I mean, what is your problem with this? - Uh-uh-uh. Daniel-san, if karate used defend honor, defend life, karate means something. If karate used defend plastic metal trophy, karate no mean nothing. Understand? I wish I did. Go find a nice pot for bonsai across street. Oh, here's your pen. Before I forget. And if you have a minute, just in case you change your mind, here's the application. Okay? I mean, It's no rush. I mean, it says at the bottom... We have a couple of weeks before we have to send it in. So, uh... I'm sorry if I made it seem like we had to do it today. We have some time. Hello? Oh, hi. Could you turn that off? - Sure. - Thanks. Hang on, I'm almost finished. That's okay. It's okay. Take your time. That's pretty cool. Thanks. So, what can I do for you? Well, actually, I came... I was looking to buy some pots. Yeah, what size? Um... - This would be good. Like this. - Yeah. Yeah, they're for bonsai trees. We're opening a shop across the street. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. Great. Well, welcome to the neighborhood. Thanks. Yeah, I love bonsai. They're so perfect, you know? Maybe when we get our trees in you could come visit the shop. And meet my partner, too. I haven't even really met you yet. - I'm sorry, my... - Oh. - Daniel LaRusso. - Jessica Andrews. Hi. Hi. Is that you? Well... Yep, that's me. What happened to the guy who lost his head? Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him. The traitor. So, yeah... - The pots? - You know what we could do? I mean, if you can do it. Could you put like a bonsai tree on the side of the pot? It's sort of like our trademark. Okay, like embossed? Your right. Right on the side. I'll draw a picture of it for you. - That would be great. - That would be great. - Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up. - Okay, listen. I got to - deal with this guy. - Okay, I understand. Well, thanks, I'll see you soon then. How soon? How soon? Well, I don't know. - Busy tonight? - No. No? Well, then I'll see you tonight. I mean, if that's okay with you? Okay. About 7:00? - Well, sure. 7:00 is good. - Okay. I just live right upstairs, so go around the side, okay? - Okay. - All right. I'll see you around the side, 7:00. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Charles is going to get angry. Open up the gate. Hey, you found it, huh? Hai. Thanks to you. Thanks to me? I didn't do anything. That looks great. You find something? Yeah. Yeah, actually I did. I found a date. You didn't send me over there just to look at pots, did you? Yeah, I knew it. I knew it. Did you sign it? Did you sign it? You didn't sign it. No. Listen, Mr. Miyagi, I understand your feelings on this. I do. But you have to understand mine. This is the biggest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm proud of this title. Why can't I defend it? Daniel-san, you no look answer Miyagi. Just like a bonsai live inside the tree, answer live inside of you. Yeah, well, the only thing living inside me right now is a lot of confusion. I have the chance to be the champion again. All I have to do is put my signature to it. Or match to it. - A match to it? - Hai. Then you watch confusion disappear with the smoke. "442nd. " Perfect. What are you doing here? - Forget something. - What? For shop. Bring good luck. Well, hopefully it brings good customers, too. Daniel-san look good. Yeah, thanks for the shirt. I love it, man. What doing? Well, I've been thinking about what you said, and I decided to take your advice. I'm going to let my confusion go up in smoke. I'm not entering the tournament. I want my karate and your karate to mean something. Good decision, Daniel-san. This way no more bruises. Save money on bandage. Get out of here. They never laid a hand on me last year. Just an elbow, a few feet. I'll never forget that knee to the groin. That was interesting. I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi. - Hi. - Hi. So, you all set to go? Uh... First I gotta tell you this, um... See, I have something... After you hear this, you just might change your mind. What do you have, poison oak? A boyfriend. You see, he was in the headless picture. You know, we broke up two months ago. You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney... Yeah, we were both a little dumb about it, but you know, we've been talking on the phone and... I don't know, we're gonna give it another try when I go home. - Where's home? - Columbus. Ohio. Wow. Yeah, I'm gonna go back after Thanksgiving. I just didn't want to lead you on or anything. - No, no. - I mean, I did come on kind of strong. No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing. - We could go Dutch. - Okay, that sounds great. It's just that I've been here for two months with absolutely nothing to do and I haven't even met any friends. Well, meet your first friend. All right. - Yeah, this is wild. - What? Wait till he hears about this one. Who? Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner. He's uh... You wanna meet him? He's right across the street. - Yeah, why not? - Oh, great. You are about to meet the greatest guy. This guy, he's funny, he's smart. I mean, you got a problem, he's got the answer. He's like no one you'll ever meet. On top of that, he just happens to be my best friend. Why do you call him "mister"? - Hey, Mr. Miyagi. - Hey. Meet Jessica Andrews from Columbus, Ohio, and across the street. This is Mr. Miyagi from Okinawa and Reseda. - How do you do? - Hi. - Jessica's gonna make those pots for us. - Yeah. Wow, very good. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you very much. How's it going so far? Good? I never know retirement mean such hard work. You like to see inside shop? Yeah, I'd love to. Partner show you around. Don't forget lock up Daniel-san. No, I won't. Good night. Nice to meet you. Good night, nice to meet you, too. I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Yeah, you see why I call him "mister"? Yeah. He's nice. Yeah, he's the best. Come on in. Oh. Oh, what's this? That's Mr. Miyagi's. He brought it for good luck. So, what do you think? It is going to be great, huh? - Yeah, yeah it is. - It needs a little work, but you know... So where'd you meet him? I met him when I moved out here. Then he started teaching me karate and then from there... - Karate? - Yeah. - You do karate? - Yeah, I do. He doesn't really look like the karate-teacher type. He doesn't act like it too much either. Half the time, he teaches me stuff, - I don't even know what I'm being taught. - What do you mean? It's like that vase you were making this morning, right. He'll make a whole karate lesson out of that. - No. Come on. - I'm not kidding. Show me how you were doing, making that... You go up and then you go down. - Okay, now you do that. - Okay. Okay, go up. Right, right. Now, okay, right, see just like that. Now go down. Okay, now do that again. Go up. I'm a mugger. I'm gonna grab you, now grab the back of my head. - Then pull down and bring your knee up. - Oh my God. Room for one more down there? Hey, what are you doing? We're not open. Well, the door was. No, I meant for business, pal. I didn't come here for business. Came here to talk to you. We heard you weren't entering the All Valley this year. Is that true, Daniel? - Where'd you hear that? - Is it true? Yeah, that's true. So what? So, we'd like you to reconsider. Is that why you guys came down here? Yeah right, look. I need your title. So, then enter the tournament and go for it. Maybe you didn't hear me. I need your title. You don't enter and that effects my financial future, Daniel. And I'm not gonna let that happen. Get it? Listen, I have nothing to prove, all right. I have no reason to fight. Yeah, well, I do. I got some money to make. Give me the application. Listen, I said forget about it, all right? I'm not going to fight... Sign it! You sign it, man! Come on, man! Right now! Come on, right now. Let's go, punk! Let LaRusso sleep on it. Come on. Mike! Yeah, you sleep on it. You sleep on it. And you... You can dream about me. You slimeball. Slimeball? That's cute. What? Your mother teach you that? Come on, Mike. You'll have to excuse him. He's usually a very mellow guy. I don't know. Later. What? Do you know those creeps? No. And I wanna keep it that way. Again. Excuse me. Mr. Miyagi? Hai. My name is Terry Silver. My master is Kim San Jang of South Korea. My teacher sends his respects. John Kreese of the Cobra Kai dojo was our school's number one student. Word reached us in Korea only two months ago about what happened last year at the tournament. My teacher sends his apologies for John Kreese's dishonorable actions. Accept apology. I was sent here to help John regain balance. Hope you can be successful. Unfortunately, I arrived too late. I buried John last week. He's dead? What happened? His doctor said it was cardiac arrest, but I knew John better than anyone. Karate was his life. And after he lost all his students, it just broke his heart. John was a hero. He wasn't always like what you saw. He saved my life in Vietnam. War does something to a man. You had to have been there to know what I mean. Have been. Do know. 442nd? Hai. Oh, man! More medals of honor came out of the 442nd than all World War ll put together. I bet you've been there. - Is this your student? - Hai. - The champion? - Yes. Our apologies to you, too. John had vowed to come and apologize himself. He planned... Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt your training. Mr. Silver. Very sorry to hear about death of friend. Yeah, me, too. Thank you. - God, that's too bad. - Hai. Too bad, Daniel-san. Come, we continue kata. - Hello? - Hi. - Eat yet? - No, I haven't. I was supposed to have dinner with my Aunt Pat. She owns the shop. Anyway, she had to do some things, so I got stuck with all this macaroni and cheese. Macaroni and cheese? You know what I like! I grew up on macaroni and cheese. Hey, listen. I never say no when it comes to macaroni and cheese. - Here, have a seat. - Thanks. I used to eat this stuff by the ton. Now, I want you to try this, okay? And be honest. Okay. Well, on a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as... Eleven. - Let's eat. I'm starved. - Okay. I hope you like this. I'm not sure if this is exactly what you wanted, but ta-da! - Hey, this came out great. - Yeah? Oh, look at the tree. You got it just right. - Oh, good. - Wait till Mr. Miyagi sees it. Do you think he'll like it? Like it? He's gonna love it. - Here. - Okay. I have something for you. For me? What? What is this? "The Down Stairs"? What is that? It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great. It's got live music. It's for the night before you go back home. I figured it would be a nice going-away present, so... Oh, Daniel, that is so sweet. Hey, come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore. Come on, turn on the lights. Hey Danny, I hope you got some good news for my friend Mike here. I hope so too, Daniel. Listen, I told you, all right? I can't help you out. Forget about it, all right? - Hey, where are you going? - Hey, come on. You mean you haven't signed the application yet. I'm not signing the application, all right. I'm not gonna compete. Please just take your friends and get out of here. Hey, Dennis. He didn't sign it yet. Hey, hey, come on, guys. This is getting out of hand now. Don't you get it? I'm not signing the application. Sure you are. No, I'm not going to be there. You're wasting your time. - Take off, all right? - You take off! - Come on, Dennis, take him out! - Put his eye out! Come on! Hey! Come on, punk! Come on! Let's see what you've got! Nice kick. Not bad. Better. Good, but not good enough. Come on, get up! Why are you being so stubborn? Don't do that! I am running out of patience, LaRusso. Now sign it and let's get on with it. Stop it! I'll kick your ass! Just get out of here! Save it for the tournament! Nail him! Mike, come on, let's get out of here! Come on, old man! Mike, let's go! Let's go! You wimp! I'll be back, LaRusso. I'm gonna get you, man. You hear me. You're finished! You're finished! You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head. So, Daniel-san, time take Jessica home. Yeah. Jessica, you all right? Yeah. I just want to lie down. You know, I can't believe you're singing. Forget it. Feel lucky, Daniel-san. Lucky? How could you feel lucky? Feel lucky. Bonsai tree not in shop. Safe at home. That makes us real lucky. I never felt luckier in my life. Ah, Daniel-san, we can rebuild the shop. - Cannot rebuild stock. - Yeah but... We sell a few trees, fix shoji screen, start over again. - Everything will be okay. - Yeah, but... What if those guys come back again? What are we going to do then? If they come back, what are we going to do? Just tell me, what do we do if they come back? Sing happy song. Where are the trees? Where'd you put the trees? They stole them! They stole them! I can't believe it. They stole the trees. Don't they get it? I'm not going to sign this thing. Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do? How we... Where are you going? Get fishing pole. What? Sometimes I don't get you. The shop's wrecked. We've just been robbed, and you're going fishing, huh? We're flat broke and you're going fishing. You're just going to fluff it off? Doesn't this even bother you? Daniel-san, sometime better be bothered on full stomach than empty one. Ah, great, another great thought, huh? That really does me good. You go fishing. I'm gonna do something about this. I'm going to the police to report it. Show them the application so they can arrest these jerks. This is the '80s, you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi. You can't be so damn passive. Somebody's gotta do something about these guys. And then I bring the tournament application to the police station. But as I walk in, they all start laughing at me. Then finally the sergeant said, "Son, we'll look into it. " - So, we'll see. I hope. - Yeah. Well, I still kinda think you should ask Mr. Miyagi before going after his tree. He wouldn't think he'd hide it out in the middle of nowhere if he wanted people digging it up, you know? Look. I don't have a choice. If Mr. Miyagi doesn't sell this tree we're looking for, he loses his business. He's broke. His social security can barely cover the expenses on his rowboat. I mean, this tree is like money in the bank. Great. So now we're robbing a bank. So, how much do you think this thing is worth? I checked around. I found out - these original bonsai trees... - Uh-huh. They start at $10,000. No, way. Seriously? See, that's why it's so important to me. This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life. That's the least I could do for him. Wow! It's a long way down there. You know what I think? What? I think when the tide comes in, the ocean fills up the bottom down there. Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows how to pick 'em. Yeah, no kidding. I mean, how are we supposed to find Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this? Well, he told me he put it halfway down the steepest cliff, where it would catch the first rays of the sun. Okay, good luck. We're never gonna find it. Wait! That's it. That must be it! I found it! - Are you sure? - Yeah, oh God. It's beautiful. It's like the one on the back of my gi. - Come on, let me see. - Wait... Oh it's right... You see that ridge, where the sun hits the... Oh, yeah. There it is. It's just like the one on the pot I made. Yeah but now how are we going to get all the way down there? You leave that to me. I'll teach you. Come on. We gotta go get the ropes. You sure you understand everything? Yeah, I got it. I feed this through here and I hold this back here and I pray to God. Okay, whoa. Now, are you sure you want to do this? I wanna do this? - I gotta do it. I'll be okay. - You go it. You'll be fine. - I'll be... - Just, uh... Just remember, the rope is your friend, okay, and everything will be great. Friend? This rope's more than my friend. I love this rope. This rope and I are going steady. Right, rope? Just you and me, rope. Oh, God. Wait, wait... Whoa. Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry. - Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it. - Okay. Okay. This is almost fun. I'm coming, okay? Just keep going. This isn't so hard. You're a pretty good teacher. Thanks. Daniel! Look out! Oh my gosh! You okay? I'm coming! All right. - Daniel, are you okay? - I'm okay. Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming. Stay there. Okay, I got you. I got you. Put both hands on the rope. Put your feet against the rocks and push out. I got you. Push out. Push out! There you go! All right, I got you. Whoa. Okay, now guide your rope. Slide your hands to the brake. To the brake, the brake, to the brake. Right here. All right? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You okay? Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock. - You sure you're okay? - No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. God, it's a lot steeper than it looks from up there, huh? Well, you've done this kinda stuff before, right? Yeah, but not from this high up. Oh, great! Maybe we should go back. Do you want to go back? No, no, I gotta keep going. I gotta do it. I gotta do it. I don't have a choice. Well, just be careful, okay? Watch your footing, there you go. All right. God, you scared me. I scared you? - You can get killed doing this. - Just think positive. - How are we going to get back up there? - Don't worry about it. You're right. I got enough to worry about. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What? Where's the tree? It's right there, between the two rope, see. - Oh yeah. - Come on. - Wow, it's a beautiful tree. - Yeah, huh? Mr. Miyagi must have looked like Spider-Man coming down here, huh? Yeah, no kidding. Now, remember how I told you to lock off. Take the rope and you put it around your butt. Oh yeah. And you tie it around your leg. Okay, get it? There you go. I got it! There you go. You got it. - All right. - Now you can use both your hands. All right. So he really planted this here, huh? - What? This tree? - Yeah. He brought this all the way back from Okinawa. Yeah but... What if he tells you to put it back? I mean, what do you... No, seriously. What if he does? He's not going to tell me to put it back. Believe me, I know this guy. That bonsai shop was his dream come true. He's not going to have me put it back. I don't know. I still don't think we should be doing this. Yeah, well. I saw his face when he lost his job. Believe me, I know what I'm doing. But what about the tree? Isn't it going to die? The tree's going to be fine. We just have to pack the roots well. That's the most important thing. Believe me, Mr. Miyagi taught me everything about these trees. Here, do you want me to take this for you? No, I got it. I got it, I got it. All I need is a bag to pack the roots in. - Daniel! Help me up! - Hang on! Hang on! Don't let go! Grab the rope! Are you okay? I got it! I got it. Oh, my God! The tree's in the water! I gotta get it! I gotta get it. I got to go. It's gonna get washed out! Come on. Move! Hurry up! Get out of the way! I gotta get it! It's gonna get washed out! The rope! Hurry! Get the canteen, quick! We gotta wash the roots off. Come on! Come on! The salt water will kill them! Is it gonna be okay? I don't know. Mr. Miyagi will know what to do. Just let's move it! Move it! All right, I got the canteen. It's ready. Come on! Come on! We gotta get out of here! The tide's coming in! Wash the roots off. Be careful. All right, let me have it. It's soaked. You did good. Put it right in there. All right, little fella, I'll have you home in no time. - Good. No big breaks. We're in good shape. - I'm really sorry. I just should have tied off better. It's not your fault. Look, it was my idea to... The ropes. - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey, LaRusso! How you doing? Heads up, Danny-boy. Here's something you forgot. How'd they get here? Hey, this isn't a joke anymore. Oh, I know! So let the ropes down! First sign the application. Hey, screw you, man! See, I think you got it backwards, buddy-boy. I'm not the one who's screwed here. Now I figure, the tide's gonna come in about 12 minutes. Hope you brought a life raft. How do we get out of here without a rope? Without a rope, we're dead. We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead. You're dead, man. You want me to sign it? Fine, I'll sign it. I'll sign it. We'll get in the ring and we'll see who's laughing then, huh? We'll see who's smiling then. You're gonna be dead meat. I hate this guy. Here. I signed it. You want it? You work for it. You pull us up! All right! We'll send them down. Let them go. I never learn. I never learn, man. I should have just signed the damn thing in the first place. I should have signed it and gotten it over with. Hey, come on. You couldn't have known this was gonna happen. Yeah, with this guy, I should have known. I should have known with that guy. I should have just signed the damn thing and gotten over with it. We wouldn't be stuck down here. The tree would be safe. I'm just such a jackass. Come on, get us out of here! Come on, pull! All right, I got you, I got you. You're one heavy wimp, Daniel. Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling! What are you doing? Pull us up. Keep pulling us up. Leave him there. Get the application. No, you get the application when I get up there. Oh, yeah! - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. All right, here. Just hold us. - Go get it. - Here, take it. Check it out. It's cool. That's it. Hey, don't even think about backing out, man, because then I'll really be pissed. And this, well, this'll all seem like a happy memory compared to what I'd do to you. And what we'd all do to her. Now you're talking. Hey! - Come on! Pull us up! - Hey, come on. What, Tarzan? Pull us up! What will you give me? Hey, I gave you the application. Come on. Yeah, the stakes just went up. Give me the tree. - Daniel, don't! - No! - Shut up. - Shut up. All right. All right. Just hold us. Don't let go. Ahh, here. Now please be careful with it. - I will, I will be. - Please, be careful. What are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna plant it down there! - No! - No. No, don't, please. All right, enough. Give me it. You want it? Yeah, just don't throw it over. Be careful with it, please. Hey, Daniel, make a wish. No! Mr. Miyagi? Daniel-san. Oh... The trunk's split. See? I just, uh, I put the roots in peat moss, but they got salt water on them you know, and I washed it off. Will you be able to save it? I didn't mean for this to happen. I'm sorry. I just figured maybe we could sell it so we wouldn't have to close the shop. I didn't want it to be my fault your dream didn't come true. And I know whoever bought it would take good care of it, maybe even better care than itself, you know. - Tape. A wide one. - That's so stupid. How can someone take care of it better than where you left it? I just didn't mean for this to happen. Hold. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Miyagi forgive you. You do? I'm such an idiot. Is it gonna be okay? That depends. If roots strong, tree survive. Uh, where do you want these bonsai trees? Over there on rack, okay. Thank you. Trees? Peat moss. Peat moss. Trees? What? What did you do? - Did you buy these? - Hai. With what? Sell truck. - You sold the truck? - Hai. Well, why didn't you tell me that's what you were going to do? I wake up this morning, you gone. Damn it! Damn it! Why am I so stupid? No worry, Daniel-san. Everything work out. Everything okay now. Mr. Miyagi, I signed to fight in the tournament. Why? Why? Why? Why? I don't know why. Because I'm not you, that's why. Because I don't always have the right answers. We were at the bottom and they were pulling the ropes up and I made a decision on the spot. So I made it. It was the wrong one. What else was I supposed to do? Understand. - You do? - Hai. Listen, Mr. Miyagi, I gotta be honest with you. I don't stand a chance against this guy unless you train me. Understand. Well then, you'll train me, right? Daniel-san, Miyagi always train you. But for tournament, cannot. Cannot? Cannot? What? What do you mean, cannot? Mr. Miyagi, why not? You know what the worst thing was? When he told me he wouldn't train me for the tournament. Then I knew I was dead. What a drag. Oh, great, let me get some water. I'm dying of thirst. You can't swallow. I won't. Come on, you can't keep stopping like this. You gotta build up your wind. Why? So bonehead can knock more of it out of me? Oh, come on, Daniel, you gotta have more confidence. Remember you are the champion. Yeah, I'd like to forget it. Hey. Hey! Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, Jessica, this is, uh... - Hi, there. - Mr., uh... - I'm sorry, what's your name? - Terry Silver. - Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews. - Hi. You two training for the Olympics or something? No, uh, just some tournament. The one you won last year? What's it called? The All Valley. Right. Good. Good for you. A champion should defend his title. John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart. - Oh, yeah? - Listen, do you know how to front sweep? - Well, uh, not really. - Learn, learn. Most of these tournament guys are suckers for the front sweep. You can catch them every time. Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you. Yeah, well. I'm kind of training for this one myself. Oh, that's too bad. Look, I got a good book on sweep techniques. I'll drop it off for you sometime, okay? - Great. - All right. Nice to meet you, Jessica Andrews. Take care of our champion, huh? - All right, I will. Buh-bye. - Nice truck. - That was a nice offer about the book, huh? - Yeah. Come on, you ready? - No, I'm pooped. - Let's go. Yes. All right, here I come. Come on. Hurry. Okay, I'm running. You gotta get some muscles. Oh, man. Hey, get out of here, man! I signed it, all right! What'd you call the cops for? Why'd you steal the trees for, huh? You have no proof. Who left the application, the tooth fairy, huh? It's your ass, man! There's nothing you've got that I can't counter. Your karate's a joke. Let him up, punk! Who are you, his mother? Maybe. Get up! Get up! You see this? You see it? Get your hand off me. Get your hand off me! I ever see you even on the same street as this kid, I won't be so charitable with your health. You understand? You understand? - Yes! - All right. Get the hell out of here. Who is that guy? - That's the lunatic who wants my title. - Come on. I was hoping you woulda killed him. No, no. That's not what karate's about. - It's for defense. - Yeah, yeah, I know, you're right. Here's your book. I brought that for you. Oh, yeah, right, right, thanks. Of course, there's only so much you can learn from a book. You're telling me. Come on, stand up. Let me show you a couple of moves. Help you deal with punks like that. Make a strong stance. Back leg up a little more. Okay, now sweep me. Well, what do you mean, like that? I'm not made of glass. Do it right. Better. Now a little higher and at the end twist your hip. Keep your hand up. Hey, you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. That's good. That's good. That's a strong move. Look, everyone needs a teacher, Daniel. I'm opening the Cobra Kai Dojo again. It's time to set things straight. Anytime you want to train, I'll be there for you. No strings attached. Thanks. I appreciate that, but... Listen, thanks for helping me out. It's my pleasure. All right, I'll see you around. Yeah, I'll see you. Hey, thanks again. - Hey, Jessica. - Hey, Daniel. Hey. Mr. Miyagi. Listen, I have a favor to ask of you. Uh-uh-uh. Daniel-san, look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like? I stayed up all night firing them. Yeah, yeah, I know. I saw one the other night. They're great. Listen, I have a favor to ask of you. I just want to ask you, do you know how to sweep? Of course. Would you mind showing me how? I'm not asking you to train me. I don't want you to train me. Just this one thing. Just this one thing. I'd be so appreciative. All you have to give me is one thing. That's it. Please, please, please you gotta do it. Be a pal. You wait here. I be right back. Where you going? Just wait here. This is great. Mr. Miyagi's gonna teach me front sweeps. I found out from this guy, the guys who fight in these tournaments, they're suckers for front sweeps. - Really? - I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm... Daniel-san, you hold like this. First, left sweep... It's no joke, all right? You don't want to show me, you don't show me. Just don't make fun of me, all right? I'm sorry for asking. Don't worry. It won't happen again. Hey. Hi, that was great, man. - How you doing? - Good. Just trying to work the rust out. Listen, I gave your offer some thought. - And, um... - And? And if it's not too much trouble, I'd like to take you up on it. I mean, you know, just on a short-term basis. Oh, trouble, are you kidding? It'd be an honor. How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it? Well, Mr. Miyagi, he, uh... He doesn't... He doesn't need to know about it, if... But he knows you're competing? Yeah. He knows that. He just, he doesn't approve. Well, everybody has a right to his opinion. Look, I won't say anything. Thanks. So, when do you want to start? No, I mean, that's up to you. Whenever it's... Oh, hey, I got a gi hanging in the closet. I think it'll fit. What do you say we go right now? Now? One more. Good. Catch your breath. Come on over here. You're better than I thought. You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso. You're ready to move on. There are three things that make a champion. The three D's. Desire, devotion and discipline. The first two I can't give you. The last one I can, but you have to be willing to receive it. Are you, Mr. LaRusso? Sure, sure. The response you're looking for is, "Yes, sir. " Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. That's okay. Stand up straight. Now, over the years I've developed a system of intensive short-term training for situations just like this. It comes in two parts and has three rules. I call it "Quick Silver. " That's good. You like that, huh? Rule Number One. A man can't stand, he can't fight. Repeat it. A man can't stand, he can't fight. With conviction, Mr. LaRusso. A man can't stand, he can't fight. Good. All right. Imagine these two-by-fours are legs. Sweep them. What are you... That's too low. Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee. Right? Did you come here to teach or to be taught? We're not sweeping floors here. Harder. Come on, put your hip into it. That's where the power is. Right. That's it. Harder. Harder. Ow! Ow? "Ow" is not an acceptable kiai in this dojo, Mr. LaRusso. Well isn't this a little bit extreme, sir? I mean, come on. Extreme situations require extreme measures. Now, you come back tomorrow. We'll start again. You did good for your first day. Thanks. Hey, I really appreciate all your help. Thanks again. You're welcome. Who is it? Miyagi. Hey, Mr. Miyagi, uh... Why don't you come in? Just catching up on some sit-ups here. You know, it's not easy when you're training yourself. Daniel-san, what happened foot? What foot? Wow! Look at that! I don't know. Maybe I banged it in my sleep. I don't remember. I just... What's that? You soak foot. Be better tomorrow. Why? You got a new foot in there for me? No. Next best thing. New foot powder. Smells like old foot powder. What's in there? Better you don't know. Give me foot. Ow! It's hot! Hot, hot... Good. Daniel-san, maybe tomorrow you remember what happened foot? Then you tell Miyagi. Tomorrow? No. I have so many things to do tomorrow. Tomorrow, I'm busy. Tomorrow is, uh, tomorrow is a bad day. I mean, in the morning, I'm supposed to, uh, in the afternoon, I'm supposed to meet with a buddy of mine I haven't seen since, uh, since we got back, you know, from Okinawa. What am I doing? What am I doing? Hope confusion end soon, Daniel-san. Miyagi heart empty without you. The bruise on your foot is gone. That's good. You're a fast healer. All right, let's go. That's a nice little move. Mr. Miyagi teach you that? Uh-huh, no. No, I didn't think so. What was the last thing Mr. Miyagi taught you? Uh, we did kata. - Kata? - Yeah. Kata is good for working up a sweat. It's not gonna win the tournament. Come on over here. Hold the bag. Rule Number Two of the "Quick Silver" method. A man can't breathe, he can't fight. Now, imagine this is the enemy. These are his ribs, behind them his lungs. - You got it? - Yeah. Good. You try it. No, wait a minute. Let's do it over here. - Where? - Right here, his ribs. Lay into him. Why do I have to do this with this thing? Because it's a part of the training. Because I'm teaching you techniques you don't have. Techniques you need to win the tournament. What, do you think you can rely on that crane crap? I did pretty well with it last time. Hey, wake up and smell the coffee, Mr. LaRusso. Last time you weren't fighting this. You don't get it, do you? You want to get beaten because of a little pain, be my guest. I can't be a part of that. I make wimps into winners, not the other way around. Christ, I'm wasting my time. - Yeah? - Miyagi. Damn it! Could you come back later? Daniel-san, why are you doing this to yourself? Doing what? What you doing. Because Mr. Miyagi, extreme situations require extreme measures, okay? Oh, Daniel-san, that not sound like you talking. Well, it is me talking, all right? Look, I'm sorry if you don't like it, but I got problems and if you're not gonna be part of the solution, just don't give me a hard time about it, all right? Okay? You got it? What are you wasting your time with kata for? Didn't I tell you it's useless in a tournament? Huh? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry. All right. Come over here. Let's get back to learning something that can do some real damage. Rule Number Three. A man can't see, he can't fight. If you hit him square in the nose he'll be blinded by his tears and choke on his own blood. Here's how it works. You wait until your man is attacking and when he's close enough... But that would be face contact. I'd be disqualified. That doesn't... He ran into your fist, not your fault, right? Right. He can't continue. That means you win. - You like that, Mr. LaRusso? - I like that. Good. Give it a shot. Let's try it over here on your friend. Reverse punch. Visualise. This isn't a bunch of sticks and pipes anymore. This is a living, breathing fighting machine that wants to detach your head from the rest of your body! It's blood. So what? Make believe it's his. This guy wants to break you. Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground. What are you going to do about it? - Going to nail him! - Then do it. - Yes! You did it! - I did it, man! - You nailed him! - Yeah! You're ready! You're ready! I'm ready! What new teacher? The guy who's been training me. You met him. Remember the time we went jogging and he pulled up in the car. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know who you are talking about. He's teaching me stuff, he's got me doing stuff I thought I'd never be able to do. That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi. Yeah, well. But this guy's different. How do you mean "different"? I'll show you sometime. Come on, let's rock 'n' roll. All right, let's do it. What are you looking at? What are you doing looking at other guys like that for? I don't play that. - I got some nerve? - You got some nerve... What about you? - No, you get... - Get out of my way, white boy! If I don't get something to drink, I'm gonna die. Yeah, tell me about it. I could drink a horse. - Hey, Danny. - What? Mr. Silver, what are you doing here? You told me you'd be here, don't you remember? Hold up, sexy lady. Who's your friend? I've been watching you and you are hot. She's with me, man. - Says who? - Says me. Come on. Yeah, come on, let's go. Hey, bonehead, I'm taking her home. What are you doing? What is wrong with you? What, are you nuts? Come on. We gotta get out of here! Up you go. - What happened? - He broke my nose, man. Yeah, he sure did. Where's that guy with my money? Get out of the way! Come on! Oh, man, that was beautiful. You didn't even think. Something got in your way, bang! Down it went! Listen, I gotta go back in there. - What are you talking about? - I gotta check that guy out. Danny, come here. Technique and killer instinct. You got it all now, kid. No, I gotta get out of here. Where you going? What's the matter? You did the right thing. You had no choice. Who is it? It's me, it's Daniel. What do you want? - Can I talk to you? - I'm busy. Just give me a minute. Come on, please. Look, I... I just want to apologize for what I did tonight. It shouldn't have happened. Yeah, maybe you should tell that to the guy whose nose you broke. I am. I will. I just didn't want you leaving thinking that was me. It wasn't you? It wasn't you? Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian? Look, Jessica, I've been trying to be someone I'm not and it just isn't working. I feel like I'm losing control of everything. The only thing I see you losing control of is your temper. Yeah, well, and your friendship and Mr. Miyagi's trust. I've lost everything. I don't know what to do. I've totally wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi. Everything. I know he's written me off. And I can't blame him. I don't blame him. I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. Come on. Nobody's written you off. Just because I got upset with you, that doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore. Mr. Miyagi, he loves you. He has faith in you. He told me that. Let's see how much faith he has in me when he hears about what I did tonight. I think he should hear it from you first. It's too late. It's too late. I blew it. It's blown. You're gonna blow, unless you do something about it now. Yeah, I know, you're right. It's easy to say. It's just, I don't know if I could face him. You'll do fine. You just gotta do it. Well, I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can. Listen. I'm going to miss you. Send me a Christmas card, okay? You got a deal. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks. Anytime. No, I just spent the last 20 minutes telling the other nurse that I don't know his name. I'm the guy who broke his nose. I just need to talk to him. I need to tell him that I'm sorry, I gotta tell him that I want to pay for it. Just please, let me speak with him. No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right. I gotta talk to him now, damn it! All right. I'm sorry, okay? I don't mean to be rude... Hello... Hello, miss? Damn it! Oi! Oh, Mr. Miyagi, look at this. Look at my sweatshirt. I got some poor guy's blood all over me. Everything you taught me, I did the opposite. Everything. I couldn't have been worse. I did everything wrong. I just feel like your tree. You know, the one that I wrecked. I feel just like that. I feel like I'm falling apart. Come. Miyagi show you something. I feel like the whole damn world is coming down on me. And it's my fault, It's all my fault. I did it myself. Everything can heal, Daniel-san. Just take time. Take patience. God, I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi. When I started out I never meant for it to end up the way it did. Sometime when take trip, better know where trip end. Otherwise better just stay home. Hey. Hey, it's budding. Hey, look at that, it's gonna make it, huh? Hai. Make it because have strong root. Just like you, Daniel-san. Inside you have strong root. No need nothing except what inside you to grow. Understand? Yeah, I do understand. You're right. You're right. Look, I gotta go. I'll be right back. I'll just be a little while. Where going? - You remember that guy, Terry Silver? - Hai. He's the one who's been helping me train. He meant well, but I just want to tell him it's over. It not wait for tomorrow? No, I'll feel better if I get it over with now, okay? You like Miyagi come help you? No, Mr. Miyagi, I did it myself. I'll get out of it myself, all right? I'll just be back in a little while. Hello. Mr. Silver? Hello? Hello? Mr. Silver? Hey. - Hi. - Here you are. Where'd you go? I had to go think about some things. - And... - And? And I've... Listen, I've decided not to defend my title. Look, I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I mean, you've been great. I just... You know, when I hit that guy, that's just not me. I just wanted to come here and tell you in person 'cause I figured after everything, I owed you at least that. You owe me a lot more than that, Danny-boy. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the lessons were for free, but... No, no, no. No. Nothing's for free. You are going to defend. You're getting in that ring. Excuse me, Mr. Silver, you can't make me do something I don't want to do. Danny, Danny, Danny. From the moment you met me, I've been making you do things you didn't want to do. What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? - Yeah, what? Let's show him what I'm talking about. I'm what he's talking about, shithead. We have an agenda here, Daniel, it's really very simple. You guys are crazy. Either you fight one fight on one day, or you fight everyday for the rest of your life. - You're sick! - What's it going to be, Danny boy? It's gonna be I'm not gonna be there. So just forget about it, all right? Let's show Mr. Kreese how he's going to get his business back. I'm not gonna fight, you can't make me fight. You don't have to. You can just stand there and let him kick your ass. Do the crane, Danny-boy! You're doing this to yourself, man. Yes! You wanna see some more? I wanna see a lot more. Bring him back. You see his face? See the trail? I think he peed in his pants! Well, well, well, look who's here. The big war hero. What are you waiting for? Party time. We're old friends. Come on, little man. Let's see how good you really are. You think this is the end of it, old man? I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos all over this valley. Hell, I might even teach for free. From now on when people say karate around here, all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate. John Kreese's karate. You won't even be a memory. Yes, he will. You won't. Now will you train me? Hai. Now Miyagi train you. Come. Waste time here. Here, here. We plant tree here. - You take tree. - All set. - Careful. - I got it, I got it. Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet, huh? Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you. Put you back where you belong. There you go. Nice comfortable spot, huh? That feel good? Good spot, Daniel-san. I got just what you need. A nice cool drink. Let some of your old roots soak that up, huh? Daniel-san, this bonsai have strong root. Same you. This tree now choose how it grow. So must you choose how you grow. Miyagi have great faith in you. Understand? Hai. Come on, Daniel-san. See you around, old fella. Point, Barnes! The score is 2-0. Let's do it up, do it right! Ready? Begin! - Did you teach him that? - No, no, no, that one's his. That's a warning for a kick to the groin. Once more, costs you a point. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Three points for Barnes. Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there. Winner! Face me. Bow. Shake hands. You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass. While we're waiting for the challenger to catch his breath... T- shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts! I'd like to thank a new patron of ours for the purchase and donation of the permanent home of the All Valley Championships. Ladies and gentlemen, the president of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver. Yeah, Mr. Silver! Thank you, John. Thank you very much. I've always lived my life by the rule, "If you get, you give. " For the last 20 years, I've gotten from karate. I've gotten discipline, health, self-confidence, inner peace. Everything that makes me what I am today. And today, it's time for me to give back. It's my pleasure to announce my partnership with the greatest karate man I have ever known, Sensei John Kreese. Yeah, Mr. Kreese. Together, we are about to open a chain of Cobra Kai dojos where young people can come and learn the same values I've learned. Honesty, compassion, and fair play. Thank you all for coming. Enjoy the final match. Thank you, Mr. Silver. And thank you again for your most generous contribution. Remember the game plan. First you win a point, then you lose a point. Keep the score 0-0. Pulverise him for the full three minutes. Then in sudden death, you get the point, we win. I want him to experience pain. - First he suffers. - Then he suffers some more. Representing the Cobra Kai, the challenger, Mike Barnes. And in this corner, someone who needs no introduction, the defending champion from the Miyagi dojo, Daniel LaRusso. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! This match will have a three-minute time limit. The first fighter to score three points will be designated this year's All Valley Under-18 Champion. Fighters to your marks! Go out there and get him. Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him! Remember, folks, the new rule this year states that if there is no winner at the end of three minutes, the championship match will go into sudden-death overtime. When it's over, his mother won't recognize him. You both know the rules. Light contact is allowed to the body, and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes. No face contact is allowed. Any violation of the rules will result in a penalty point. On your lines. Come on, Daniel! Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow. I said bow. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Break, break! Let's go. Out of the ring. No point. Begin! Point, Barnes. Score, 1-0. Look over at the slope. Is that perfect? One point Barnes for the punch. Fighting positions. Begin! Hey, Danny-boy, how are the family jewels, huh? Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat! Do that again, Barnes, and you're disqualified. That illegal groin kick will cost Barnes his previous point. Score is now 0-0. Kick to the groin. Penalty point. Score is nothing-nothing. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! That's the one, Mike. Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch. Go, Daniel! Come on, Daniel. Let's go, LaRusso. Point Barnes. Score is 1-0. Ready? Come on, Mike, you got him. Begin! Break, break! On your line! That's it, Barnes. One more violation and you're disqualified. That illegal punch will cost Barnes one point. The score is again 0-0. You all right, LaRusso? Intentional face contact, penalty point. Perfect. Score is nothing-nothing. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy. On your lines. That's a warning for running out of the ring. Come on, Barnes! Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Break! Break! On your line. He'll get up. He's too dumb not to. LaRusso, on your line. Get up, you pansy-ass! No point for kick to the back. No point scored. This is beautiful. It's beautiful. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Break! What's the matter, sweetheart? You having trouble breathing? - On your line. - I love it when he pounds him! On your line. This is more fun than I thought. No clean technique on that exchange, so no point scored. The score remains 0-0. Ten seconds left in the match. Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Time! Break! There will be a one-minute rest period, then the match will continue with sudden death. Daniel-san! Mr. Miyagi, it's over. It's over forget about it. - No. - I'm afraid, let's get out of here. - I want to go home. - You can't, you must not. Is okay to lose to opponent. Must not lose to fear! Yeah, well, I'm afraid! I'm afraid of him, all right? What do you want me to do? You stay focused. Daniel-san, your best karate is still inside you. Now time let out! That's the end of the rest period. Fighters on your lines. Come on, get up! Get on that line! Get on that line, LaRusso! You're worthless! Your slope teacher's nothing! Get up, man! You're no champion. Get up! You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man! And your teacher's karate is shit. You hear me? He's shit! You're done, LaRusso. Your karate is a joke. And your teacher's worth shit. He's nothing! And you're nothing! I own you! I own you, LaRusso! Where's your little Jap teacher now, huh? He's a phony, man. He's a fake and he didn't teach you nothing. Your karate's shit. You hear me? Get up! Come on, Mike! This is what we've been waiting for! Fighting positions. Ready? Begin! Mike! Take him out! Hit him! Get the point! Get the point! Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating. Winner!
