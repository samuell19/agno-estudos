[eagle screeching] [thunder rumbling] [siren blaring] [birds chirping] [blades slashing] [warriors grunting] Great shot, Chip. When I kill you, I want you to know it's me. Until then, Cayla. [Tenan] Sofia! [intense music] [flames crackling] [Tenan] Commander, are you gonna introduce us to your new friend? I will explain once we get to base. But for now, he's our king reincarnated. Zahyian Crehin. The Zahyian Crehin, the legendary Royal 4? So the crystal worked? It did. Cool. So hey, was he like married or? Hey, were you like married or, you know, like have a girlfriend? Chip! So this is where the stone lead you to? This weak, pathetic species of a man? How could you be so sure the stone did not lead you astray? [dramatic music] You may be my second in command, Tenan, but don't think for one second that I won't crush your skull if you dare put his life in danger. Don't address them other than sire. Blink twice if you understand. You may not fully realize it yet, but heed my words, he's your king! Now stop bullshitting, everybody, let's go! You really need to work on your people skills. [eerie music] [Sofia] [echoing] When I kill you I want you to know it's me. Until then, Cayla. IL-Roserious, are you all right? Ten, Tenan, Tenan, why is he? [Cayla] Come on, let's go home. No, no. No, I need to go to the Q-temple, the Q-temple- - [Cayla] You're in no condition- - Cayla, I need, they need to know- - Fine. - I need to tell them, - Fine. Make sure she gets to the temple. Yes, commander. And don't leave her side! Come. [cicadas buzzing] Come on, hair. That feels better. [Juken grunting] [tense music] Fuck. [dramatic music] Shit. Where is that little fucker? [mystical whirring] [mystical whirring] [dramatic music] Move away, beast! We don't want to fight, just hand us the odd one and we'll let you go for today. No deal, you ugly fuckers, let's go, come on, come with it! A feisty one, I like feisty ones. Maybe I'll keep you around after I kill the others, huh? Maybe we'll have a little fun. I'm gonna cut parts off of you that you didn't even know you fucking had, you little bitch! Let's go, who's first? [thunder rumbling] Commander Hayden, which one is this Sil? Neither one, sire, they are his guards. They should feel the power of the Neptonian chant But hand to hand combat is more rewarding Let's see if anything's changed in the last 2000 years. Who you supposed to be? You better be bringing something more than just white eyes. [dramatic music] [fire roaring] Where is your master, Sil? Fuck you, you ancient shit! [blows ringing] Fuck! Your Cree technique is weak. This is what you meant to do. [blows thudding] After all the centuries, you monsters follow the misguided, the delusional souls that want nothing but to spread evil unto our Mother. No more! I'm back, Lord Zhayian Crehin, Lord of Murs. and I command you- [mystical whirring] [Zhayian grunting] No! [power crackling] Focus. QUIL-INSIN-FIREBIE QUIL-INSIN-FIREBIE BOI! What are you doing? He needs our help. Sofia, we have to save him. No, he needs to find his balance, between this age and his own. Commander, this is no time for a lesson, he could die. This is a perfect time. You say you're King of Murs, so die like they have, in pain! Sire, focus! Find your strength, embrace the essence allow Eric to come with you, come together and find your balance. My turn! - Sire. - Sire. Rise, my friends. I fight with you now. Commander Hayden, thank you for talking me through it. It's my first realization and I see that it's best handled with the company of trusted companions. No, thank you, sire. Who are these two? Major Tenan Fy of Murs, at your service, sire. It's a pleasure, Major. And you are? Chip. Chip, that's it, Chip? Yep, I mean, yes, sire. I am known as the Queen of Thieves, at your service. I'm also very skilled fighter. She's an okay fighter, sire. I can get you whatever you want. I see. I mean, whatever you want. Chip! So sire, what did you do to that goon? I pulled his energy and essence and gave it back to our Mother. Why? So she can use it for something good. You're a bad sire. Sire, everybody, we've got to get going, Sil's guards will be here soon. [jewelry jingling] [Sofia] [echoing] Combine your strength Embrace the essence Find your balance Sa-Lum-Sa-Lum, Veir, Dah, Su-Mon! [mystical flames crackling] Commander Hayden, the keeper of the stone still lives and finds a Royal 4, no less. Hmm. And I assume you'll be searching for the other three. Well, Commander, I, the Witch Athis have been following your journey for quite some time, Sofia, and you've always been strategic, careful, until now. The power you have awoken solidifies two things, The Kings must reclaim their Thrones and Yahzeel must be found. [dramatic music] I don't have time for this. Get the fuck out of my way. The mighty Cayla Korvesian, alone in the forest. This is our lucky day. Isn't it, Squim? Yes, it looks like she needs some company. Yeah, it's dangerous for her to be in these woods. I am your queen! You serve Sil's republic, which means you serve me! So stand the fuck down! No, no, I don't listen to you! I listen to me. I was a Tyramglin, rich and strong, but now, nothing but a goon. Created by your master to roam this forest forever, living off the dead. I don't give a shit. Get the fuck outta my way. Kill “The Daughter of Demons” and be praised, show that we are the demons to be feared and be rewarded. Yes, yes. Do her slow, bring back pieces for us to taste. Yes. Yes. You goons are fucking delusional. But I see you want this to happen anyways. Fine. My blade will not be soiled with your disgusting blood. I'm gonna break you by hand, painfully. Yes, yes, I can almost taste you. You're mine! [blows thudding] [bone snapping] [goon shouting] [goon screaming] [goon screaming] You broke my arms! [goon groaning] No, no, please! Please! Have mercy, my queen, I'll do whatever. [goon shouting] Shhhhh. I understand. I understand Goon, living in these woods, it's terrible, I know, I know, you were just trying to do something to make you famous, right? Thinking Sil would give you your life back? I respect a man who dares stand up to me. But you are no man. [blows thudding] Commander, are you okay? - Whoa. - Come on. [waterfalls roaring] [shower splashing] [clears throat] [Aressa] Who's there? Hi, my name is Orin. Sorry to bother you, miss. I was just looking for some dry clothes and I heard the water running. [Aressa] Are you alone? Yeah, yeah, I'm alone. Are you sure? Yes, I'm alone. Just me, see? Okay, okay, you can put your arms down now. So, Orin, are you taken? Uh, what was that? I asked, are you taken, do you have a girlfriend? No, no, not right now. Maybe one day. Orin, relax, I'm just fucking with you, just wanted to be the first to break the ice, that's all. Right, break the ice. Sorry, it's just been a long, long day. Quite sure it has. Hey, can you go in that closet over there and hand me a towel, please? Sure, anyone in particular? No. Hurry up, Orin, it's cold. Sorry, here you go. Thank you. Can I ask you something? Yeah. What's your name? Good question, Aressa. It's nice to meet you, Aressa. It's nice to meet you too, Orin. So, how did you survive in this house during the invasion? There was an invasion, right? Yeah. Can you actually go over there and get those clothes for me? Sure. [eerie music] Were those clothes always there? Of course they were. You stepped over them earlier, don't you remember? How did you know what I just- Did I just say that out loud? You okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. I guess. Thank you. You're quite a character, Orin. So how did you survive? By hiding in the sewer. Ugh. Yeah, it was terrible, but it ended up being the perfect place. Sil's goons never looked there because it smelled so bad. What about your family? Taking as property or killed before I could escape. Oh, I'm sorry. How long ago was this? About three years ago. Three years! And you're still here? This is my home. This, this is my home, no one else's! I understand that, but there are still people out there who can help you. Help me? Help how, exactly, Orin? There's nothing out there. If Sil's goons catch you you'll be either made to be a servant or turned into some mindless goon that feeds off of the dead and are used as target practice. No, not me! This is our world now. Kill when you have to, survive however you can. I still can't believe that Mother has to fallen to the devil himself. There is no hope. Of course there is, Aressa. We have to believe in something. If we don't, we might as well be dead ourselves. Maybe we should be. Come on, don't think like that. Look, I'm sorry if I upset you. No, I should apologize. I didn't mean to snap- - No, no, I get it, I get it, it's fine. Things are not normal anymore, I know. Hey, I saw a symbol for the Resistance above a door when I got in, do you know where they are? Yeah, those fuckers, they came in, took everything that wasn't broken and left. Really? When was this? About a year ago, but I wouldn't worry about them. They're nothing but thieves. In a way I don't blame them. Are you sure? I hear the leader was a former ambassador from one of the largest regions in the north and then he fled when he found other fellow world leaders were in cahoots with Sil and that his bond with Mother, it's extremely strong, strong enough to keep the Resistance hidden from anyone, even Sil. Well, I say, forget them. Should worry about keeping yourself alive. Excuse me. Was that jewelry always there? You know, you're looking a little tired. Why don't you have to take a shower and get some rest? No, no, thank you. I can't, I don't have time right now. Time? What, are you on a secret mission and someone's after you? What? Why don't you just take your clothes off, hop in the shower. There's no one here but us. I don't know. No, I really should be getting going. Orin, you stink. Take off these rags, hop in the shower. I'll keep a lookout for you. Yeah, I think you're right. It would be good to wash it off. Sure it would. Wow, what a cut. It looks, beautiful. What was that? Come on, let me take my shower first. [dramatic music] What are you? What do you want? I'm a scavenger, darling, haven't you heard of us? We can see your deepest desires and you desire me! A scavenger? Relax, Orin, relax. I cannot feed until you concede. Be a good boy, and let me in! It's been such a long time since I've dined on bones such as yours, tight muscles, clean blood, I want you raw! [scavenger roaring] I'M HUNGRY, I'M HUNGRY! Relax, dear, relax, accept your fate, darling. I cannot feed until you concede. Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod! So you're a Fusionite? I thought you were all dead. How did you survive, dear? Your artform doesn't work on me, boy. Concede to me, let me in. You wouldn't want to poison me now, do you? I'm going to kill you. I know you want to, dear Orin, but your muscles are getting weak, your breath is slowing and you're losing blood, that sweet Fusionite blood. Give me the pleasure of feasting on you. Let go! [tense music] [blows thudding] Concede, to, me! Let, me, in! [Rinshi] Don't die on us yet young man. Grab my arm and fuse. Please, help me. I am, boy, grab my arm and fuse, now. [dramatic music] Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod. [scavenger roars] [blows thudding] Concede, to, me! BILISH-TICGOR-ROE-RAYTHUM! [speaks in a foreign language] They can regenerate any part of their body like a lizard. They're hard to kill, but you did it, though, good job. You got a light? Who are you? Where are my manners? My name is Captain Rinshi Su Cora, a Croathian from the City of Kyzin. But you can call me Rinny. Okay, why didn't you help me? I thought I did. Yeah, you could've killed her yourself. With these powers, why didn't you? I needed to know if you are, who I thought you were. What are you talking about? It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Orin TiRosch, Son of the famous Fusionite scientist, Braythin and Angelamare TiRosch... yes?... How do you know about my parents? How do you know about me? I don't know you! I should just kill you right here with your own powers. You may, but we both know my counter moves and the fight will take far too long to be worth the time we don't have. Who are you? Answer me! I'll tell you, but can I please have my throat back? Thank you, sir. As I mentioned before, I am Captain Rinshi Su Cora from the City of Kyzin and an ambassador for the very group you're forced to look for. The Resistance? Yes. How do you know? It's hard not to, when "The Daughter of Demons" herself recruits a new scout. It wasn't my choice. I know, young TiRosch. I also know that your parents and Commander Hayden were very good friends. I believe they assisted her in rediscovering the ability of bridging between worlds with use of the Stone of Essence. You know Commander Hayden? I do. I even knew her parents, Madielyyn and Sorkinston Hayden of Murs, the most feared military couple in the city. And they made sure their little girl earned the same recognition. Do you know where she is? Doing what she was meant to do, holding her pledge as the keeper of the stone and searching for the Royal 4. The Royal 4? The myth about the 3 Kings and Queen who defeated an evil warlock named Yahzeel over 2000 years ago? That Royal 4? That is a mouthful, but yes, that Royal 4. And I assure you, they are quite real. And they are presently living in their reincarnated bodies that Sofia must find. When I was little, my mother used to tell me about how the Royal 4 would be needed again, to defeat a great evil. But I always just thought it was a story to make me go to bed. I never thought it would be something real, or if it was, it would ever be in my lifetime. Your mother knew something was coming and wanted you to know. Come on, we need to go. Let's go see your brother. What did you say? My brother's dead. No, Orin, he is alive. Your brother survived. What kinda shit are you trying to pull, Rinny? I saw him die myself during the invasion. What you saw was him getting injured, not dying. What? We found him after the invasion, barely breathing. Look Orin, I know this is a lot to take all at once, but I promise to explain more later. We gotta get out of here now before more scavengers arrive. Wait, wait, this isn't making any sense. I understand, but we need to go now, unless you want to fight another scavenger. Wait, so if what you're saying's true, tell me something about my brother. Your brother talks too damn much. He's consistently yapping about all kinds of shit. The boy drives me crazy. Yeah, he does talk a lot. Ba-La-Ry-Ba-La-Tok, Myne, Kyne, Toh, Cross! [mystical crackling] [echoing voices] Are you ready? What is this? Welcome to the Resistance, Young TiRosch. Right there. Where's Sofia? Upstairs, keeping an eye on things. Ah. That's about right. Damn, I'm good. So, sire? What do you think? Well done, Chip, well done. You have some great skills with this device. I feel like a new man. Well, sire, you kinda already are. Yeah, good point. Did you learn this skill on your own? I did. You know, when you're an orphan, you learn to pick up a thing or two on your own. Guess you would have to. [Chip] Yeah, you do. So tell me, what is your name? What do you mean, sire? I mean, you know my name. But I don't. I noticed you were a Tyramglin species, but who are you? [tense music] Oh no, no, no, no, sire. It's me, Chip, remember? Are you Eric right now, maybe you're Eric. Like, I'm Chip, you know what, I'm gonna go get Sofia. She knows exactly what to do, just give me one second. Chip, it's all right. It's all right, my memory's just fine. I was just asking about your real name, that's all. Oh, thank god. I thought Eric was coming back out for a second. I was just thinking, Chip, Queen of Thieves, doesn't quite roll off the tongue. I sense there's something more to that. It doesn't, does it. You know what, let me properly introduce myself. My name is Mia Bello, Queen of Thieves, at your service. Ah, Mia Bello, Queen of Thieves, now that sounds more like it. Pleasure to meet you Miss Bello. So where did the name Chip come from? Well, when I first met Tenan and Sofia I wasn't too pleasant or nor cooperative. I mean, why would I be? I just escaped one of the most horrific experiences of my life, his killing campaigns. Everyone I knew was being taken, killed in front of my own eyes. That fucking monster destroyed my everything. Sil. Yeah, him. Before all this I was the Queen of the Underworld, the bitch everyone loved, the bitch everyone feared. Hell, sire, I had princes and ambassadors offer me things you can't even imagine just for one night with me. And then he came. And he took it all. And then I met Sofia. Well, she admired my thieving skills and you know, my thirst to see Sil dead. You know what, one day she said to me, I like you, woman, you are survivor. You've got the fire in your belly that burns so bright. And I like that. And you possess a strong chip on your shoulder And I see that you don't hide yours. So, I think I'm going to call you Chip. Sofia's right. That edge, that chip, something you never want to lose. Well, sire, it's something that's always been there and it always will be. Yes, I can see that. You know, Chip, I want you guys to understand that when I had Lord Yowan, Lord Gato, Queen Ki and myself cast our essence into the stone, it was my intention is to have our artforms die with us, never allowing it a chance to be used for evil again. [Chip] Well, shit happens, sire. Yeah. Well, these dark days were supposed to have ended with Yahzeel. What I can't seem to understand is why would Mother allow a devil to be born again? Did we miss something so long ago? It's not your fault, sire. I mean, Mother can be an unpredictable bitch at times, but if you look on the bright side, the Royal 4 is back, they're here to save us all, and you're not some fairytale. [Zahyian] What was that? Oh, Sofia didn't tell you? Well, species down here tells it as a literary fable, that they tell the kids if they're bad the Royal 4 will come back and bury them in The Forest of SiKoran. That is preposterous. We, we do not murder children. We are Ressear's protectors. We are not monsters. I know that now, but sire, a story that as old as you are kinda had a way of- [Zahyian barks] No, that's outrageous. I know, right? [Sofia] Chip! Yeah? [Sofia] Have you done his sire's hair? Yeah? [Sofia] It's your turn to come up here. Yeah, coming. Really, a fairy tale? Well, not anymore, sire. [phone ringing] Reagor, do you have the king? [Reagor] No, looks like a bomb hit this place. Do you want me to- [somber music] Hey, sire. How you feeling? A little taken back. Is it true we're a scary story? Chip told you, huh? Yes. This is why I told you about Akinnis in the theater, do you remember? You were Eric at the time? I think so, it was a little foggy, but I believe you stated that he was the only one who believed in me at the time. Yes, including a few of us who knew the truth. Thank you, but why did you? I'll explain everything to you later. Right now we need to begin to gather provision and prepare for base camp as we sail down this river. Fine, but I expect to be briefed on everything once we arrive. Of course, sire, Mother's my witness. Where are the clothes I got for you? What clothes? The clothes that Chip was supposed to have given to you. She didn't give me anything. Oh, geez, that girl with men. Here, sire. Thank you, Commander. [tense music] [sound of a slowing heartbeat] Istaaa-Gon-Rorrr. [slow, chiming music] Well, you've done more than enough today, Sofia. Why don't you get some rest and wash up and I'll do some catching up with these guys in the meantime. That's a good idea, thank you. Now, try not to get in trouble while I'm gone. I'm a king, it's what I do. Sofia, quick question, where did you find The Stone of Essence? I'm a woman, that's what we do. How the fuck can Tenan Fy still be alive, Cayla? I thought you killed everyone in Murs, especially him. It happens, IL-Roserious, some slipped out, some died on the way out, in the end they all die by our hand or serve Sil of course. Cayla. Rah, baby, please, it's been a long day. Why don't you join me, huh? Relax a little. Fine, have some wine. No, Cayla. This is Tenan Fy, Cayla, not just some headstrong Croathian you can simply manipulate. He's a prodigy, like me. He's a legend for what he did amongst his species during the Murs invasion, your invasion. I know, he killed a lot all by- - Two hundred, Cayla. 200 of your men by himself. I was there and Murs still fell. And this doesn't bother you? Really? Can't you see, if other Croathians find out that their leader is still alive? That he still fights for them? This can cause problems in the Alliance. And on top of that, my Quensentian army consists of hundreds of these headstrong brutes and I do not need to start killing off pieces of my own. If so, so what, Rah? There's plenty of species that want to be part of your Quensentian Order and wear those sexy-ass outfits. Yeah, well, I need a certain amount of Croathians in my Order to maintain balance. I know. We have to be smart about things and reset. We still have an ancient king to find, cities to prep for Yahzeel's return, and a Resistance to kill. So, c'mon, take off those wet clothes and relax. I am just concerned about SWA finding out that Tenan is still alive. You know, Lieutenant Kytan is a Croathian himself, and he still holds reverence for him. Yeah, that's rich, he's the one that led most of them to their slaughter. Baby, look, soon the Supreme World Alliance will be a thing of the past. And once Sil finds Yahzeel, our powers will be endless, our cities countless, and best of all, we will be queens of everything. You know that I am yours and you are mine, we are his. Together we are shaping Ressear into a new world just for us. So fuck Tenan. Fuck 'em all. They'll be dead soon anyways. You're right, baby. I know I am. So come on, have the servants take care of you. Take off those wet clothes. Not right now. I'm planning on meeting up with some of my top Quensentian soldiers tonight after Sil's meeting to begin a search. You're relentless, Rah, that's what I love about you. Can I bring some of my soldiers too? Please do. I can't wait to see you get your second shot at my former leader. Former leader? You know, Sofia? Of course, she was my commander when I was with the Neptonian Special Forces, alongside Tenan. I didn't think she was still alive, though. Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't she say anything? Sofia led several divisions for many years so most of our orders were given to us secondhand by our lieutenants. So she wouldn't know what most of us look like anyway. She must've heard you though since you had a bounty on your head for treason. Yeah, still do. But I doubt she even cared anyway because that time, that was the beginning of Sil's invasions. So I was the least of her problems. But you could have told me at some point. Yeah, I know, but I didn't want to give away our new advantage. Besides, best she didn't know that I know. Well, I know she ran into the southern part of the forest. That's where I sent SK10 to look for them. Oh, do you have a team following them? Good. Not anymore. Reagor informed me that they were all slaughtered. Looks like the area got hit by a bomb. Looks like the king has been realized. Shit. The Ziltion River. That river leads to that area of the forest and I know Sofia likes to travel by water, especially at night. Why is that? Her artform is stronger near water. You know, that river leads towards the site of Sil's first invasion. You think she'll show using it as a hideout? I would. That place is like a blood filled tomb, no one would be able to stomach it for a long period of time, except for Sofia. You are so fucking badass. Get me a phone! Lieutenant Kryst, have Killing Squad 3 search south of The Ziltion River for a boat carrying members of the Resistance. No, bring them all back alive. In any condition. No, now, Lieutenant. I need to give her a visit. I guess my search for Tenan may be over. Maybe. Soon Sil will have the King's head and I will have Sofia's corpse on my plate. So Commander Hayden is the King's guard. [Together] My love. This explains why I could only see the King and not her. [IL-Roserious] You know Sofia? We were once closely aligned in a time nearly forgotten. It seemed, however, that she would rather hold her pledge to, you know, the Neptonian order. What is important is who she is guarding, Lord Zahyian Crehin. You can see who it is now? Oh, yes. SiKoran's essence is strong, it allows me to see and feel things once obscured. I can feel his realization growing in strength. Can you pinpoint his location? Not clearly. The cloaking chant Sofia has surrounding herself is stronger than I remember. Well, we may have found out where she is. I just sent KS3 south of the Zilshin River. We believe Sofia may be headed towards the site of your first invasion to lay low because it's abandoned. True to her character. I'm curious, my love, why couldn't you see Sofia before? Sofia is strong in the ancient arts, a true student, but no one is strong enough to fully conceal a King's essence, especially one like Zahyian Crehin. [Cayla] You admire her. Not enough to spare her life. I see you two have had an intimate encounter. I was blindsided by Tenan and Sofia is all, it's nothing. Tenan Fy is alive? And Mia Bello. The Queen of Thieves? She's the one who hit me when I was up against the tree. She must have blindsided you. Mia is alive as well. [Cayla] That fucking subterranean rodent. If you're right about where they are, KS3 should have no trouble securing the King. His abilities are not at full strength yet. In the meantime we need to prepare for tonight. Our time of sovereignty is upon us. [Cayla] What's the urgency for tonight's meeting? Wait, you found him, didn't you? Didn't you, my love? You found Yahzeel. Is that true? Maybe we should cancel tonight's meeting and begin the ritual to- - Be still, Cayla. We are carrying on as planned. Tonight's meeting must take place in order for us to take ours. And to answer your other question, Vowlen discovered his tomb not far from where we were today in Sikoran. Sikoran? He's buried in Sikoran? He is. You knew he was buried there this whole time. Why didn't you let us know? Because I needed you two to focus on finding the King and killing him so that we wouldn't be facing the problem we have now. Vowlan contacted me while I was on my way to you, informing me that Sikoran had awoken, unleashing the forest native armies upon his camp. That is why I needed to tame that thing, so that we can begin excavation on Yahzeel's tomb without any interference from him. I'm still amazed that you were able to tame an Immortal Wonder, my love. The ancient artforms are far more powerful than today's chants. My "Poison Flower", my "Daughter of Demons", our time has arrived. You've worked long and hard for this day, haven't we? The day when we can finally say Yahzeel has arrived. Doesn't that sound good? Yes, it does, doesn't it? Those weak minded, pretentious, bloated children we call the Supreme World Alliance never believed in the threat of the Royal 4, nor the legacy of Yahzeel, but we did, didn't we? Yes. And tonight they will know what feels like to be on the other side of your blades [Together] Yes, my love. [eerie music] I see there is still magic in these walls. Where are you, Mr. Orin? You couldn't gone far without. I wonder, has he come across? [fabric rustling] [gasping] Thanks to Mother, someone has finally come to save me. Sir, I haven't eaten for so long and I'm so hungry. I've been hiding from Sil's goons for- [gunshots banging] [blows thudding] [fighters grunting] Concede, baby, I can feel you want me. I want you, but I need you to relax, darling. I want the pleasure of hearing your screams as I dine on your flesh. I really hate you Scavengers! You scavengers are fucking disgusting. Tell me, where is the the boy. There is none boy here. But I know you, Juken Erstinrue. Get out of my head. Stop reading my thoughts! Tell me, where is he? I know he was here. There is no one here but me, baby. Relax, concede to me, I promise I'm gonna eat you quick. Did you kill him, tell me! [man grunting] Leave him alone, I'm not finished with him yet. A Guard Hey, don't move. Keep pressure on it, you know the drill. Thanks. What's your name? Kavyian Sho, yours? Juken Erstinrue. Who you assigned to? Lieutenant Kryst, a Vampian from the west, you? Captain Tull, A Soul-Anger from the east, fucking coward. [Juken] Where is he? I don't know. He ran off when a group of scavengers jumped us from behind. He wouldn't have gotten far. How is it you survived? Scavengers are not known to keep anything alive. It didn't. The female was about to feed on me until she heard you come in. So, thanks. You don't have to worry about her anymore. Let me ask you something, did you see a young guy come through here with a green sweater? No. What is he, your mark? Yeah. Can you get up? I think so. [Hooded Figure] Hey guys, are you here to save me? I haven't eaten in days. Please help me, I'll do anything for you. Can you fight? Yes, I can fight. We know what you are, Scavenger. So why don't you go back into you hole or end up like your girlfriend over here? What format do you suggest? For this big bastard, let's do format 43, set 90. [scavenger roaring] Let's change that, full 60, set 80. Yeah, agree. [tense music] [fighters grunting] [blows thudding] [scavenger roaring] Juken, we need to end this. I know. I need time to build my chant. Bysaleen-Ro-Bythin-Ge-Ilstrin Ahhh! Die already. I'll tell you, these scavengers are getting harder to kill nowadays. Yeah, they are. How you feeling? Tired. Me too. This is not the kind of day I had in mind, but thank you for helping me with this. Well, you did lure me away from the female scavenger earlier. Well, it worked out for the both of us. Hey, stay still, relax. Let me look around for something to mend that wound of yours so you can get out of here and back to base, huh? See if you can find some water too. [atmosphere rumbling] Well boy, it seems you found the Resistance. Hey, Croathian. Hey, sire, feeling better? Somewhat. Though much has changed since I've been away, I've got much to catch up on, otherwise, feeling more in control. That's good to hear. You know, I wanted to thank you for what you did for me back there. If you didn't arrive when you did, those women would have surely killed me. Of course, sire, it's my duty. And I thank you for not killing me back there for treating you like shit. It's all right, Lieutenant, you didn't know. Shit, I didn't know either. You know, if it wasn't for Sofia, I'd still be creating spreadsheets and business plans while my true world burns. That's a good woman you guys have there, Tenan, and you're fortunate to have her as your leader. Yes, sire, we are, but we all follow you now. And I appreciate that Lieutenant, but we are a team first and we follow what is right. What we must do now is bring back balance to our Mother. And I promise you, Tenan, we will win this. I will find Sil and all of his followers and bathe in their screams as I feel their bones crush in the palm of my hands. Do you hear me, brother? Yes. Blood for blood. [Tenan] Blood for blood. I see Croathians haven't lost their thirst for battle. No, sir, we haven't. I've seen that look far too many times, Lieutenant. When did she die? When did they die, sire. It was two years from yesterday. What were their names? Tygan and Valada. What happened? When Sil's invasion began. I hid my family beneath the royal building, in a room built for war. It was designed to house over a thousand beings for up to a year, many of Murs's top soldiers, doctors, and communication specialists to look over them. I knew they were safe! So me, Sofia, 80,000 of our soldiers ran to the wall to face Sil's monsters. We were ready to show them what it meant to battle an army of Murs. After a few hours it seemed as if we had won, the field was filled with smoke, the ground bled for miles. Many of us still stood. Then I hear Sofia yelling for me. I turned to see the back of the royal building in flames. That is where the room was. Me and Sofia ran as fast as we could, over countless bodies of our own people, to see. Somehow Sil's monsters had ripped the door apart. We searched it, searched for survivors, but all we saw were bodies laying everywhere. And there they were, my two babies, huddled together, covered in ash. I went over to touch them, and as I did they just fell apart, to dust. Sil must've been using an ancient artform you couldn't have been prepared for. You know, the scariest part is, there are times that I cannot remember what they look like. What kind of husband and father am I that I can forget what they fucking looked like? You will never forget, Tenan, you will never forget. They always live right here and right here. See them and feel them. Let me show you. Kom-Bu-Lay-Fay-Veezin-His-Love. Hey guys. Damn, this salty air really dries up a girl. [mystical chiming] Now you see, Tenan, you haven't forgotten a thing. That image pulled straight from your consciousness. That Croathian fire you hold deep down in your soul, keeps the essence of your family alive. And you lose that and you'll truly lose them forever. Yes, sire, I won't forget again. Good. Sire, Tenan, was that your family? Yes, it was. Oh man, sire, you totally got to do me next because there's people I wanna see too. Like, oh, there was this prince, oh my God, he was so fine. Oh, he can totally have me any time. But he, like, talked, like, all the time. Whoa, what have I missed? Oh, you know what, there was this fucking tyrant that I killed from the city of Torbin, and then I stole all his precious collection- [boat crashing] What was that? Sil's killing squads. So you want to fight an Neptonian king? BLADE TO FLAME! GWAR-ZOW-TO-BOR-NYE-TO-FLAME! [dramatic music]
