This is iconic. This is movie magic. Okay? And frankly, I think your anti-party ass could use a little Ferris. Are you always this confident, or is this the Ferris Bueller act?

See, you are though. There was a vote. - Must've been before I moved back. - Moved back? You used to live here? Yeah, that's how I know Stella. I moved away in the first grade. Since then, it's been six schools in three states. Yeah. It's why I don't spend too much time being social. I'd rather focus on getting into a good school. Oh! So that's why we never met. You're a nerd. Yeah. Oh, miss. So I'm in a band. Oh my God, of course you're in a band. It all makes sense. Okay, you said it like it was a bad word. No, but I bet it's actually good. Which is the annoying part, 'cause it should be bad. But I'm sure it's great. Why is it annoying? 'Cause I bet you're one of those people that's, like, good at everything. The rest of us are out here overthinking, and you're the king of karaoke. I bet you're gonna go off and become, like, a famous musician. Actually, it's gonna be med school for me. Hmm. Yeah, both my parents are doctors, so they kind of expect me to follow in their footsteps. But you don't want that? I mean, my dream, honestly, would be to apply to Berklee. It's my favorite music school, but my parents don't think it's practical. Well, then you should change their minds. Come on. There. I mean, you get into the perfect school. And then what? What's next? And then I become a lawyer. I'm gonna fight for people that need protecting. Something my mom and I talked about. Like the next RBG. Sounds like you got your whole future mapped out. Yeah, I don't know. You move around as much as I do, and you crave a little stability. My parents were actually high school sweethearts that didn't pan out. And since the divorce, my mom's kind of taken us all over, and usually, each stop means falling in love with a new guy. And right now, that guy is Steve. - We don't like Steve. - He's fine. But no, I'm just... I give her credit for never giving up. I mean, she just... I don't know, she sounds like a hopeless romantic. Maybe. I just don't wanna... ...make the same mistakes she did. Yeah. One... two... Three! Sorry. - I think it's gonna rain. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. And we're still, like, six blocks from my house. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. - Let's go. - Yeah. This is me. I'm glad to have witnessed you live up to your party-animal name. Mmm. I'm not looking for a boyfriend. - Oh, yeah... - I'm sorry. You didn't even ask and... I'm just afraid. We've had this night. If we kiss, we'll wanna kiss again. Or at least I will, and I don't wanna do this whole thing if we'll break each other's hearts in ten months when we graduate. I'm sorry. What? Why do we have to break each other's hearts? This whole thing, high school, this is the prologue. It sets the stage for the rest of our lives, and no offense, but I'm not gonna be taking my prologue with me. Okay, you think I'm insane. Look. We... we... Okay. We... we... we can kiss. That's fine. But I just... I needed you to know all the facts, 'cause, like, I... - So... okay, that... - Okay. Okay. Okay. - I think you need a new plan. - My plan's pretty set. It doesn't include me, so I'd like to make an amendment if I may. I'll allow it. Okay, how about... we kiss again? Mmm. If that kiss leads to something else, then we make it the best year ever, you know? And then we'll just end it. It's done. - Like a breakup pact? - I'm proposing a breakup pact. So what's gonna happen in ten months when this is over? I'll take you on some kind of epic date, you know? And then... and then... and then we just go our separate ways to close out the... - Prologue. Yeah. - Prologue. That's the one. Do we have a deal? Deal. - Hi. - Hi. Um... Yeah, I'll just go for it. I'd like to take you on a proper date to see a band I'm pretty confident will be your new favorite. Are you now? Whoo! - Saw you dancing. - I heard music. I might have moved a little.

He's not taking me hot-air ballooning. For your last date? Clare, he could get a bunch of doves, fricking release them, and they assemble the words "Clare, we can make it" in the sky. Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If a girl sent me doves, I'd be done for. That would require you to actually talk to a girl. "Require you to actually talk to a girl." For your information, I'm working a very diligent long game with Tess, okay? - Long game, now? - Yes, it's very long. Well, the long game's gonna have to speed it up because time is running out. Time's kind of running out for you too, dude. It's for the best. I'm not gonna be like my parents, Stel. I'm not doing that. Okay. Casually pivoting, uh, I think a few people are maybe going to South Point Beach later... - Tess is going to South Point Beach later. - Don't make me sound like a stalker, dude. - I'm not. - We did Spring Awakening together. We're bonded. That's one of Broadway's horniest musicals. It was hot and heavy. Mrs. G didn't even make us do the junior version. - We straight up got to do regular. - I think you should message her. I think you should slide into her DMs, but that's just me. Clare? Oh f... No. What? I just sent a crying reaction. - To... to Tess? - To Tess. Okay, fine, you DMed her. That's good. This is a good thing. Just say it was an accident at the bonfire tonight. Are you gonna be next to me while I have to suffer and do this? I'm at the mercy of Aidan tonight, but, um, we'll see. I'll try. Speaking of, he should be here, like, any minute now. - Okay. - You need help. - It's okay to ask. - I don't need help. - You do need help. - Look, it's going. Look at that. Something ugly's in here that's asking to not be brought to college. - That's what's happening. - Probably the whole bag. But don't worry about it. All right, well, um, call me if you need backup. You, uh... sure you're ready for this? Yeah. Yeah, no, for sure. It's obviously not gonna be the easiest night in the world, but it's a good goodbye. - Lilies. - Hi. - Good choice. - It's the flower of funerals. I like it. - You ready? - Final date. - Whoa. - Ah, damn it. Oh, Mom. - Hey. - Hey there. My folks are right behind me. Good to see you. Let me help. I mean, we were all ready, minus the chaos. Let's get this up. We're gonna be lost without you. You kids break up yet? - Hi. - How are you? - You know everyone thinks you're idiots? - Of course. - Hi. - Hi. - My favorite sister. - Oh, my only brother. Okay, here we go. While no parent loves their teen dating, Clare did manage to find the one thoughtful high-school boy. I did. And even though she's letting him get away, Aidan, I loved having you in our family this year. And, Clare Bear, God knows things have not always been easy for us, but somehow, you have managed to grow into this brilliant, caring, and determined young woman. I'll kill you if you're late for our 7:00 a.m. departure, so... Okay, we know it'll be me dragging you out of bed in the morning. Ooh! - Okay. Yeah, maybe. - It's true. Okay. To Clare. - Yes. - To Clare. Clare. Steve. I... I wanna thank you for letting me into your life. I mean, who would've thought that a year after getting kicked off the city council, I'd be living in a house with a beautiful, intelligent, capable woman and sending a pseudo stepdaughter off to college. Not me. Clare, most importantly, do not get mono in college. Steve! He's not wrong. - It spreads like wildfire, guys. - He knows what I'm talking about. Cheers. This is why we didn't need to do the toast. - To Clare and Aidan. - Okay. - So, Clare. - Yes. - Poli-sci at Dartmouth. - Mm-hmm. - That's amazing. So cool. - I'm excited. And Aidan is pre-med. - I thought you'd do something with music. - Oh... No, Mr. Perfect over here is gonna follow in their footsteps. Yep. Cardiologist, like his old man. Excuse me. He's gonna be a radiologist, just like his mama. Well... - I think we have places to be. - Yeah. We should, uh... we should get going. It's a lot on the itinerary. Itinerary? - Bungee jumping? - Yes. We're going to buy a dog? I've been really patient. You need to tell me what's going on. You texted me 13 times asking me what we were doing. It was me holding back. It is my epic date. It's my rules. Period. Technically, the whole "go to college single" thing was my idea, so... Clare, do you trust me? Yes, I trust you. - Even though everyone thinks we're crazy. - Oh, please. They wish that they could end a relationship this well. We're like the anti-broken hearts club. - Poster children of modern relationships. - The king and queen of ending things.

Check. - One. - Aidan. Colette, thank you so much for hooking us up. I can't believe you hooked him up after he bailed on your band. - How dare he bail on us? - Whoa. I'm still mad at him for not applying to Berklee. I am too.  I told him. But he just had to go pre-med. - The golden boy has lives to save. - Okay, I'm standing here. - Yeah, we know. - Yeah, we see you. Have a good breakup or whatever this is. Thank you.

But maybe I'm... I'm also just clinging to that, 'cause Aidan's safe and easy. But also it, like, wouldn't be easy at all if we were long-distance. Also, we're supposed to go off and be our own people and have our own experiences and... That was the point of this whole pact in the first place. Yep. Know what? I'm being really stupid right now. I'm sorry. - How we doing? - Great. Clare'll be out any second. I wanted to make sure we're still good. Yeah, we're all set, man. This can't be the end. We're making the right call. Aidan knows it. I know it. We're gonna have our last date, and it's gonna be incredible, and then that's it. I feel like we can make it, and hopefully, by the end of the night, she'll... she'll feel that too. Thank you... for everything. You don't want to be the douchey guitar guy in your dorm. Bring, like, a keyboard or something. You think my dad is gonna let me haul a whole-ass keyboard to school? I mean, he's not the grandma from Coco. I don't know. Music's allowed at college. I don't know, you say that, but he's downloaded an eight-part cardiology lecture for the trip. - Rough. - I'm dead serious. Well, at least your parents can road trip without killing each other.

Everything that the light touches is all ours for the next hour. Whoo! Okay. Tonight, we are reliving our firsts. All right? We've already gone on our first date, and now we return to our first hockey game. Okay, but that hockey game was our first fight. I don't know why we need to memorialize our first fight on our last date. A first fight is momentous. It's a moment of growth. That is such bull. I don't know why you just can't admit you farted. I don't know why you're bringing this up. Aidan and Clare? - Yeah. - Yeah. This way. The race's about to start in one minute. You guys look good. Ba-boom! Aidan, you can't say that you farted. I announce it. Like, "Yo, I let one rip." It's funnier if you do it like that. You don't have to be perfect all the time. Not with me. Please turn your attention to center ice for the intermission race around the rink. We've got the hot dog and the popcorn. We've got the mustard and the ketchup. "Sorry, I let one rip. My fault." It's not a big deal. Admit the truth. I didn't fart. I don't know what else you want me to say. I was in the car with you. Okay, so is it disgusting if I fart? You can fart if you wanna fart. Everybody farts. I'll hold it in. Whenever I'm around you, I'll never fart. You have my word. Oops, I just farted. - Let me just move. - Three! - But that's what you're acting like. - Two! - One! - Team Hot Dog, baby! Team Hot Dog! Go! - You can't admit it. - Can we just focus on the race? You were so excited two minutes ago. - I'm over it. - It's for Ellie's Deli. I'm over it. I gotta go. Are you actually leaving 'cause you think I let one rip? I'm leaving because you don't trust me enough to admit it. I do think we owe it to ourselves to finally win not only one but two pastries... Oh my God. ...from Ellie's Deli. What're you... No, no.

I mean... - Not to be sappy or anything, but... - Uh-huh. Okay, stop. I never thought I'd have a group of friends like this. 'Cause you did nothing but school. Ow-wah! No. Well, like, a little bit. But because I, like... I moved around so much. And, I don't know, it's our last night before we all go off to our new lives. Aidan and I are celebrating our firsts, but how often do you know that this is, like, the last time of something? Damn. For real. I got suspended before I even got to tag the senior wall. Never got to leave my mark. I'm pretty sure you did that when you streaked at the soccer game. Well... well, yeah. I mean, you know I like to show my school spirit. Everybody saw your ding-dong, my guy. - Aight, uh, this has been a blast. - But I'm saying... - Okay. - This has been a blast. You guys are awesome. I love you both. - But Clare and I... - We should go tag it. What? I think you should tag the wall. We have time, right, Aid? Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a full night planned. I know, I know, but it's our last night as a group together too. And Scotty, Scotty needs to make his mark. Absolutely. We can't leave him hanging like that. We can't let him be forgotten. No, we don't want him to be forgotten. - Don't you have to work tonight? - Dude, I got off like an hour ago. Aidan, it's just one stop, and we get back to our night. For Scotty. Break into the school? And also there's... My... - Your character shoes. - Character shoes. - Your what? - Character shoes. - In your locker. - In my locker. Let's go. Let's go tag the wall. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's go tag that wall and save Stella's character. - Yes. - Close enough. This is gonna be really fun. Am I crazy? - Aidan? Dude? - Come on. Let's go. Aidan. - It's gonna be fun. - Come on. - Please? - Come on. Come on. - I mean, I guess it is our only... - Come on!

You know, when Clare got sick before the prom, she was actually relieved she didn't have to go. Stella, you know good and well that she would've had a great time if we would've gone. I actually don't think I know that. You can't control everything, Aidan. You can't... "Aidan" your way out of situations. Aidan my way out of situ... - What in the world... Please tell me what... - You know what... I think you know what I mean. I have no clue. You used my name as a verb. What does it mean? Positively, when one, an Aidan for example, behaves in a sort of manner where, you know, you sort of... You know? And then things kind of go your way. I'm just saying, you both set the rules at the start. You can't be upset if she doesn't wanna break them. There's no way we could've known it would've turned out to be as good as it is though. It's good. Yes, you guys are my favorite couple. I'm obsessed with you. So you think I should keep trying? You just need to be honest with her. Just... be real with each other. And then when you're done with that... hope for the best, my light-skinned king. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. I feel like mixing black... - Wow, that's a lot. - Just gotta get the right color. You did just mix black paint... Now, can you check that there's blue, please? Or purple, for that matter? Thank you. You need to hurry up because they're waiting. What's the rush? I thought you'd be happy about avoiding your relationship a little longer. - No, I... wasn't. - I'm messing. Sort of. Kind of. Not really. This isn't working. I know. I just wish Aidan would see that too. I was talking about the paints. Right, the paints. Do you wanna just go with a... a solid color? Not whatever that is. Let's... let's go with red. Dude, tonight just wasn't the clean break I was hoping it would be. Please, Clare, it was always gonna be messy. And you know it. I don't know, maybe if Aidan were more excited about school, or if he ended up deciding to, you know, like... Go to Berklee? Yeah. I've heard that. You know, he's just so talented, and I know his parents think it's a huge risk or whatever to pursue that, but I don't know. I don't know if it would end up actually being that much of a risk with him. Well, I don't think Aidan thinks it'd be much of a risk with you. Oh, there she is. In the flesh. My Everest. What color you going with? Red. The color of war. Disturbing. - Scotty! Scotty! - Oh, yeah. Ready for the Senior Week suspension. Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Ooh! - Scotty! - Yo! Okay, a bold choice. - But we'll take it though. - There's so much paint and no towel. - Okay, well... - Well, thank you. What you gonna do? Wipe it on my jacket? Who raised you? - Go to the bathroom. - Okay. - Why would I voluntarily... - I don't know. - That is barely a handprint. - Yeah. How many couple prints you think actually last? I don't know. Jade and Marcus already broke up. Stella said she hooked up with some guy at MSU before school even started. Wow. Didn't even last a month. Is that what you're afraid of? I don't know, Aidan. I just... I wanna give ourselves the chance to be our own people. Don't you just wanna be able to jump into any situation and not have to give it a second thought, you know? I want that, and I want that for you too. It's one of those things I've always had in the back of my mind. And I'm sorry if that sounds selfish, but that's always been my plan... For two seconds, forget... forget about your plan. Okay? What... what do you want? Aidan... I may have triggered the alarm. He definitely did. It's the one that's ringing right now.

You know, Dr. Olsen, my son is gonna be pre-med this fall. - Is he now? - Mm-hmm. He'll be just a short drive from Clare. She's off to Dartmouth in the morning. Bright and early. Oh. - That was good. - Yeah. Ooh! - Come on. Yeah. - I mean, you know? What's your plan? Like, after school... - I got a houseboat. - You got a houseboat? Yeah, well, I'm gonna have a houseboat. That's my plan. - Okay. - What about you? - You're going to college, right? - Yeah. Is that... - Meeting new people. - That is what it is. That stuff takes time, you know? It takes people actually, like, being, uh, interested in you, maybe? I was interested in you. - Sorry. - I had a really big crush on you. - Yeah, in seventh grade. - Huh. On the bus back from Lansing. I brought mints on it, 'cause I was gonna make out with you. The mints are a nice touch. If there's one thing I know, you gotta be bold. Be bold. Tell me more about what women want. I'm telling you, it's gonna get you places. Like a houseboat? So, your last stop is a bonfire? Sort of. It... The beach was supposed to be just the two of us, but the night's taken a few turns. Ah. Well, if I were a better parent, I'd make you both go home right now. Oh, thank God you're so terrible then. Ah. We'll be okay. - Mmm. - He's alive. Ooh, let's see those stitches. Mmm. This is gonna be the last time I see you. - Clare, you're gonna do great things. - Thank you. And if you ever change your mind, he won't be too far away. When he didn't get into Berklee, he was at least excited about that. Oh, sorry, I... I thought that, um, he wasn't allowed to apply to music school. Oh, honey, no. Uh... He didn't get in. Aidan didn't tell you. Um... No, he didn't. But it was good to see you.

Yeah, sort of like my whole night. But I am willing to excuse it on the grounds of you being in the midst of the most complicated breakup of maybe all time. You didn't lie. But thank you. Like, for real. You know, this is, like, our last night together too. I know. Mmm. Aidan is not the only one who can do a big gesture, okay? Okay. - I... I've been planning for months, and I... - Don't joke about that. I present you this pine cone... Oh. ...which represents... Mmm. ...how I felt when... when you moved. All sappy inside. Sappy. I give you this. - Cheers, bitch. - Cheers. And may this pine cone burn like our friendship. - I don't know, I can be sentimental. - Is that sentimental? - Yeah. - You put a hex on me. - That's not a hex. - That's a bad omen. I'm saying, like, our friendship is like heat. It's like... Okay, for sure. No, I got there. I got there. No, but you know what's heat though? This seaweed. - Oh no, it's a sock. - That's nasty. Oh! It's a sock. Did you just throw a sock at me? Mmm. Tess. Uh, that was... that was an accident. We were, like, doing, like, a bit thing. Uh, 'cause here I thought the sock and the crying emoji were you acting out 'cause summer's ending. Uh, yeah, no, for sure. Yeah. Some people have love languages. I have a grief language, where I throw debris and send random emojis. Yeah, a few of us are heading up the beach to Ladarian's house, if you wanna come? - We kind of like... - That would be so cool. - We'd love to come. - Cool. - Uh, yes, that is cool with me. - I'll meet you guys in a sec. - Hey. Do you... - Yeah, let's... Yeah. For the record, um, the beach was all part of the date night anyway. We're just hitting it kinda late. Uh, yes. I assumed you wanted us to relive the senior swim out to Rusty. Yeah, had to happen at some point. I mean, you kind of bailed on the whole graduation race thing. Yeah, well, the water was freezing and... I... I just don't understand the tradition of swimming out to a buoy. I know, it's stupid. No, it's... But Rusty is still bobbing out there, and it's waiting for us. Aidan, your mom told me about Berklee. - Whoa. What? - Why would you have kept that from me? Clare, I'm... It's not... There was nothing to talk about. - Not a big deal. - All I've ever been is honest with you. Clare, it... it... it... I don't... I don't know what you want me to say. I just thought tonight was about saying goodbye. Or is that just another lie too? It's dare. Truth bomb. - What do you wanna know? - Dare, baby.

Hmm. Well, I don't know if it's a secret, but the truth is that... I wish you would've dared her to kiss me. - Ooh! - No, I heard it. You heard it. - Okay. - Now that's a dare.

I haven't. Are you good? Cool, no, yeah. You don't have to answer. It's all good. I'm good. I'm fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. You seem fine. - I'm good. Yes. No, we're good. - You sure? We're gonna be good.

It's uh... it's been a year, man. And it's just weird, thinking about, like, moving on and growing and... and all that stuff. And, you know, you... you meet people, and you hope that you have them for a long time. It's crazy. Some of us might see each other in college, and some of us might not. And the good parts, I don't really want to end. And I'm sure we all feel the same way. Either way, it's the end of the year, and it's the end of summer, and... and what's... what's the end without bringing it back to the beginning, right? So that said, um, I would love to invite Clare to come over. - Yeah. - Whoo! Uh, it... it all started with a song, if you guys remember, back at Halloween. What's up, everybody? Aidan.

About any of this, actually. Wow. We're gonna leave. Yeah, um... I don't know what the hell that was back there. Oh, it's just... it's me trying to do some... anything to save us. I'm sorry that you put an impossible expectation on the night. - That's not my fault. - Impossible expectation? Clare, we... we made a ridiculous joke pact, and you somehow turned it into a binding agreement. It wasn't a joke. I know you think it was, but I was very serious when I said I wasn't going to college in a relationship. That was before we fell for each other. That's... Sometimes things change. Eventually, the prologue turns into the book, Clare. Right, because we're the ones who make it. We're gonna feel the same way for the rest of our lives. We're not gonna hurt each other. It's already starting. We can't do this the rest of our lives. Oh my God, you should be studied for your ability to see the worst possible outcome. Aidan, but that's... Aidan! That's not the worst possible outcome. That's the most realistic one. I'm sorry you can't be real, but I kept it real with you, and you couldn't even tell me about Berklee. What do you want me to say about Berklee? My parents finally let me apply, I went to the audition and bombed it? It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced? - There. There you go. There's Berklee. - Oh my God. Oh my God, Aidan, it's... it's the fart. - It's always the fart. - What are you talking about? You have this impossible expectation to be perfect all the time. It's bleeding into everything. - I'm not trying to be perfect. - Yes, you are. Berklee's not the only program. There's hundreds of other programs. You know what? Maybe if you told me and let me in, I could've helped. - But it's too late. - No, no, you're right. You're right. Is there a world where I wish I could say screw it and go to LA or New York and try to make it work and most likely fail doing so? Yeah, 100%. And you say I'm unrealistic when I'm going to school close to you so we could try to make this work. Don't use that as an excuse. It's not why you're going to that school. It's not an excuse when you believe in us. It's not an excuse when I love you. And maybe you would feel the same way if... if... if you could actually say it. - What are you talking about? - Easy breezy. "I love you." "Easy breezy." Do you have any idea how much it sucks to tell someone you love them, and their response is "easy breezy." What does it even mean? - You know exactly what it means. - Just say it. Just say it. Yeah. So we're... we're done. Okay. Come on. Honey. I feel like I can't breathe or something. My heart's like beating out of my chest. Okay, okay. I know that you wanted it to be painless between you and Aidan, but that's... that's not how it works. Not when it's real. I just thought I was so careful. You and Dad... you know, you committed so young and... and fought until you broke. I just... I didn't wanna do that. You were so unhappy, Mom. Well, I'm no expert at love, no need to tell you that, but there is one thing that I do know. And that's a relationship doesn't have a shot in hell if you start planning its end before it even starts. I just don't wanna lose myself.
