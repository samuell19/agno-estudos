(organ music) (phone ringing) - [Lou] Hello? - [Penny] Lou? - [Lou] Penny? - [Penny] Lou, it laid there, like a dead fish. - [Lou] A real flounder huh? (laughs) - [Penny] It's not funny, Lou. My husband can't get it up and you wanna joke. - [Penny] Oh all right, I'll be right over. (sighs) (sighs) - Look, no crotch. - Lou, I'm eating. - Fred loved 'em. Honey, how many times I gotta tell you it's the tops you're supposed to wear? Gotta show 'em crotch. With those tits small wonder he can't get it up anyway. Okay, okay I'll shut up. - Tell me it's not me. Comfort me. - Well, it's not you. - Good, glad to hear that. He needs my help. I've got to help him solve his problem. - Listen, your husbands a doctor, a psychiatrist, he can solve his own problems. It's paranoid, freak-o's like us that keep him in business. And you in cornflakes. - Four nights in a row. It just laid there, limp. - Well Penny, he works hard, he's tired. - There's a solution. I know it. - Well I don't doubt that but it's not kill or cure time either. - It's my sex life, my marriage, I've got to solve it. - Wanna borrow my panties? - It's at the office, something's going on at the office that's causing this problem. To cure you must understand the nature of the problem. - Well, why don't we get clinical about it. - [Penny] Lou, are you my friend? - Honey, we've been friends since dirt. - You've got to help me. Please, go to the office. He doesn't know you. You've only lived next door for a week. - Can I finish my coffee first? I'm vicious without it. You think I should change? - It's settled, you go to the office. - Penny, I don't know if I should get involved in this. - [Penny] I've got it all planned. They're all sickies down there. They'll never know the difference. Not that you're crazy or anything. (mellow music) - Dr. Holmes just phoned, he'll be a little late. So why don't you wait in his office. (upbeat music) (page ripping) (drawer slams) - Do you want a glass of milk? - No, I've got some in the truck. - But I've got plenty. Oh, you have a whole truck full. - I just don't know what to do. - [Penny] I've had experience, I can tell it's not your fault. - I just can't satisfy her. - Look, maybe it's the hours you keep. Milkmen do get up early. - No, that's not it. I just can't satisfy her. I'm a lousy lover. - Can I be personal? - [Milkman] Sure. - Maybe it's your equipment. I mean, maybe you're just not large enough in that department. I mean, I could judge. I could be fair about it, where as she'd never tell you for fear of hurting your feelings. Do you know what I mean? - That's not it, I'm sure of it. - See, I knew it. You're backing away from the problem. - [Milkman] I'm not, I'm not. - Yes, you are now stand up. Stand up. - That's not it. - Come on, now look I want you to know my husband's a doctor. We've discussed these situations many times before. I just want you to know that I've had experience. Relax, men are very sensitive about the size of their organ. Oh, the milk. I didn't want it to get spoiled by sitting out there in the heat and all. That's not it. This is all wrong. I shouldn't be doing this I shouldn't be doing this is definitively not the way to solve your problem Don't stop! We won't, not until we have done our best to solve your problem It's the only way to know for sure Do me - Hi, I didn't really have an appointment but I thought maybe if you were free you could... - Oh yes.

Believe me, I know just how you feel. Tell me about it. - Well I can take the mask off, it's just decoration. - Oh no, no, no, it would be too traumatic. - No, really I just didn't want anyone to recognize me cause a lot of crazy people come here. - I know what you mean, believe me, I know what you mean. There's so many of 'em out there. You never know what they're gonna say. - Mm-hmm. You have such a beautiful mouth. - Oh, well, thank you. Can't really see, you know, the mask and all. Just two little holes, and two little eyes and a... - So, you give head? - Oh, only on Wednesdays and by appointment only. - Just what I thought. The minute I saw you walk through that door I said, "There's a girl who gives head and she's ashamed of it so she wears a mask" - I'm not ashamed of it. - Yes, you are. Listen, stay right here I want you to give me head What? - Give me head Oh God You'll be cured You can take off the mask You'll never have to wear it again Have faith, have faith! You must have faith in me It will be a long difficult cure I can cure! I can cure! You are, you are. Oh here, let me lay down Oh yeah, here, oh yeah I'm satisfied! I'm satisfied! Definitely being satisfied The problem is not yours Maybe a little longer? If you want to be sure Yeah, yes, yes You are really quite good I can't imagine what your wife could be missing Do you ever talk to her? As your making love? You're cured! What is going on here? I am Dr. Holmes, this is my office and I want to know what is going on here Well, suck a dick! Do you think you will be finished soon? I am expecting someone over Oh my god! I am glad I moved the milk Oh no! It's hit heart! I think he is coming around Coming yes, it's some kind of a heart massage Lou I don't think you should be here when he wakes up It could be a shock to his heart I'll be in the bedroom I think it was your heart You don't have anything to worry about I was completely satisfied Try talking to your wife a little more as you are making love it might help. It's a good feeling I should hope so To know that you really helped someone You're crazy, you know you are crazy You send me all the way down to your husbands office to help you with your problem Then I come back here and you are balling someguy to help with his problem What about your problem? You know, people need my help They have no one to turn to They're using you It's Willard Now don't come in. Who the fuck is Willard? Willard is the newspaper boy He is standing out there in front of the window looking in Don't let him see you Oh dear the batteries are almost dead What the hell are you doing? Willard thinks he is a voyeur I am helping him get over his problems with girls Very shy you know I really believed you when you said you wanted to help people you just like to get laid Hey little creep, what you do think you are doing? I am collecting for the paper Oh with your dick hanging out huh? No wait, hold it Let me ask you something, ever had a piece of ass? Well I almost did once Oh well yeah? Well you are never going to get it if you are standing in the bushes jerking off I'll tell you what, you lay down You lay down, and you are about to get your first piece of ass But!? - Whats the matter? But then I can't see through the window Oh you are really fucked Oh you are really fucked Oh brother Take it easy, this isn't a goddamn watermelon Well you aren't going to get very far with a limp dick Alright, I'll get you up Look at that Think you can do it now huh? Can I? Can I? Can I? Spit it out! Can I come inside!? Who said you could come creep? Just keep humpin - You perverted little bastard. It's pimples for the rest of your life you little cock sucker. - You know Lou, it's like being trouble shooters. - Trouble, yes but what are we doing? - We're solving our problems Lou. - Yeah, creating our problems. First time I meet your husband I'm giving head to one of his patients. I'm never gonna be able to face him now. - That's the first problem we'll solve. You and Fred are coming to dinner tonight. - Oh, I better go do the laundry. - Well there's no need to dress. - No, you see Fred's outta town and if I'm coming to dinner I'm gonna need a date right? And I'm always getting picked up at the Washerette. - Doctor Holmes, what do ya do when a fruit comes to your office? - Well, first of all and most important I spray them all over with insecticide and then I just prune 'em back a little bit. (laughs) No, seriously, I never discuss business from the office. I mean, each individual case is very confidential. - Oh, that's a relief. I mean, you know that you can go to your office and get help and not worry about anyone finding out about it. Not that there's anything wrong with it of course. - That's very true, but to further elaborate on your question right now I'm in the middle of group therapy and I try to allow the patient to realize his or her own problem. And if it happens to be homosexuality, then I feel that discussing it, bringing it out into the open, in front of other patients in group therapy, allows them to alleviate a certain feeling of guilt that they may have about it. - Mmm. (phone rings) - Oh, excuse me, be right back. - So, you met Linda Lou at the laundry? - Excuse me. She said it was by the dryers Yeah I was just starting a load Is that that place where the machines carry the eleven pound loads? Do you use the powders or the liquids? Well, whatever I always use the liquids myself You can pour them on stains and it just works wonders You can't make the powders stick on the stains, know what I mean? I have my own machine now So much more convenient Don't have to drag everything up drag it down to the launderette and stand around waiting You know? Did a lot more reading before I got my washer Penny, do you... I'll be back in a minute You know you always meet such interesting types there People are so intriguing Yeah I know what you mean I like to study their faces as they watch their clothes go around and around in the dryers The colors all sort of blend together Wine stains are terrible to get out Cotton isn't so bad Do you always go to that laundry? No my wife usually takes it to another place What in the hell is going on here? What were all those calls? My receptionist, she is sick and won't be coming in tomorrow and I've got to go to Los Angeles Who is going to answer the phones? Penny? I could do it I'll run the office tomorrow Ok, you run the office tomorrow - Do you want me to try some oral? - Maybe tomorrow huh? - But tomorrow you'll be getting home late from L.A. You won't feel like ... - Penny, darling, listen hey its late, I'm tired. Maybe some other night. - Are you dissatisfied with me? - It's just work. That's all, it's just work. - I try. Well, as long as you're satisfied. - I'm satisfied. Go to sleep. (Penny whines) (upbeat music) Hello, Mrs. Winegarden, this is Dr. Holmes office.

No, he does not make house calls. Hello, Lou? Lou, this is Penny. Lou, I'm going completely out of my mind, completely zonkers. I need some release. (slow music) - Oh, hi. You must be the janitor. - I'm no janitor. I'm a maintenance engineer. I went to night school to learn what I'm doing. You understand that? - Mm-hmm. Well, I know that your position in life probably doesn't offer but.. - My position? Who the fuck do you think you are lady, huh? - Oh, well, um, I've just been here for the day. And I was just-- - You were just here for the day and you're trying to tell me what to do? I mean, you even got a steady job and you're claiming you're better than me. - Uh look-- - Shit. It's all related. Your attitude, your position in life, it's all related to your sexual drive. - Sexual drive? - Mm-hmm. - I'll show you some sexual drive. You're trying to say you're better than me. You trying to say I'm not a man huh? - [Penny] No. (screams) - Come here, get down there. Get down there.

(knocking at door) - You get it. (organ music) - So nice of you to come father. - It's my pleasure Mrs. Holmes. Please call me Reverend Hope. - You're not Catholic? - No, universal church of life. It's a common mistake. - That explains it then, you see, I called the phone prayer people and they referred me to you. I felt like I needed a more personal touch. It's not that I have anything against the work they do on the phones but well, I've had experience. - I understand sister. What is it that seems to be troubling you? - Well, my husband's out of town, you see. And he called to say he wouldn't be coming back home tonight and I had this very terrible And well, I just felt like I needed somebody to talk to, somebody holy that could console me in my time of trouble. - What was the nature of the experience? - I don't exactly know how to tell you and you're being a reverend and all. - It was of a very personal nature? - It was sexual. - And this took place at your husband's office while he was out of town? - That's it, right, yeah. He's out of town and I was leaving the office and I was accosted, attacked by the janitor, I mean the maintenance engineer. - What did he do when he attacked you? - Terrible, it was terrible the things he made me do. - Could you be a little more specific about what took place? - Rape, a little rape and a little not rape. - If you want to hear it straight preacher, it's like this, she got fucked silly by some creepy, sadistic janitor and she liked it. And now she thinks she's a masochist. Simple enough? - Perfectly clear. Perfectly clear. - I didn't know how to tell you. I mean how do you relate to this problem? You don't engage in any-- - [Reverend] Sister, I'm married. - You don't know what a relief it is to hear you say that. I thought that if you'd never done anything, well then, you'd have no way to know. - To help someone it is not necessary to have experienced the problem yourself. But however, in my case being married and gay I can relate rather well to your cock suckers, buggerers, and scumbag mother fuckers. (Lou and reverend laughs) - Oh my God. Oh my God. It's against the world. We're all gonna die. We're all gonna die. Get out, get out. - [Reverend] I'm sorry I didn't... - [Reverend] It's all right-- - [Lou] It's okay, I'll calm her down. Thank you father. (dramatic music) - Penny? - Oh, just a little solace, a little comfort, that's all I wanted. We're gonna have to see a doctor, I'm gonna need professional help. A psychiatrist, oh God. If John ever found out it would break his heart. He's very religious, you know. - Honey, look just forget it. Just forget about-- I mean forget it ever happened. - I can't, I can't keep running away from my problems Lou. I'm getting no sex outta my marriage, no release. I'll end up turning to other men, like today. I'll end up a vegetable. - Penny, it's only been four days. - I'll need professional help, therapy. We'll attend John's therapy session tomorrow night. - Okay, okay listen. We'll do that and everything will be fine. But tonight, you really need some rest. I'm gonna take you home with me because you really shouldn't be alone okay? All right? (soft music) Got that pole ready honey? I wanted it all day long Give me some head first - Ok sweetheart Wait a minute, I gave you head last night why don't you give me some head this time What's the difference? Honey, you give me head this time Ok, we'll do 69 No I want head Ok I will I will, just finish me first No fucking way, you finish me or you can forget it Ok, I just wanted to make sure you didn't have anything against eating pussy You're really strange Honey, you ain't seen nothing yet Tomorrow night it's assholes I would do it tonight, except my girlfriend is asleep in the living room The problem is when I get my asshole eaten out I start laughing because I get the most terrific urge to fart Oh Jesus Christ Don't tell me you've never ate an asshole before I've led a sheltered life I guess so, you really are a straight guy Kinda nice meeting someone with normal needs and interests Lou Alright, alright Don't you worry about a thing honey All I have to do is stick my little old finger up your little old ass and that thing will pop right up You really do have a tight ass I always thought that had something to do with hemorrhoids Oh god Lou Did I ever tell you about the time I went to a costume party dressed as a Hemorrhoid? Stop it Ok, ok See, what did I tell ya? Success Now you lay here Because there is nothing like a nice stiff dick to ease my mind after a hard day Who is it? It's me Lou Just a minute Penny - Okay, come on in Penny. - Lou, I'm sorry, I was trying to sleep and I heard your, "Fuck me, fuck me" and the pressures and the tensions. And I need some release. I mean, I've been without John for four nights, four days and the pressures killing me. Do you know what I mean? - Aw, you poor baby. I know just how you feel. You need some release time. Oh God, here, you truly need some release, so you just lean over the edge of the bed. Fred? We need your services dear Do your thing I hope you don't feel bad or anything its the pressure I am under Oh hon, I understand perfectly You just enjoy yourself ok? Oh it's glorious Oh it's glorious Lou I don't know how to thank you Honey don't worry, I hate to see a good hard on go to waste Lou it's working! I can feel the tension flowing out of me - You don't know what a relief that was. It's like rehabilitation. - Oh honey, I'm exhausted just watching you. - Well now I can get some sleep. And you don't have to worry about me, I'll really sleep now boy. Oh, go ahead, make all the noise you want Lou. Nothing will ever wake me now. (Penny exhales deeply) (flute music) - You awake Lou? Fred? That's okay, don't get up, I'll come back later. - [Lou] What is it Penny? - The tension, they're starting to build up again. - Fred? Fred? I don't think he's up for it this morning Penny. He's kinda straight you know? - You know I never really got the chance to thank him. I was gonna invite him to the therapy session tonight. - Oh, honey, don't worry about it. The free lay is enough thanks. And besides, it's not a party you know. - No, it's not. I know it's not. - All those troubled people, depressing to see so many fucked up people. - Did you say, "fucked up?" - Did I say that? Did I say that? It was a slip, it just slipped right out. I don't use those words. (Lou laughs) I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm losing control. I'm losing my focus on the problem, Lou. I've got to help John with his problem, that's it. - We are helping John. We're going to the group encounter tonight. Don't worry about it, everything's gonna be all right. Sucky Fucky. (ethereal music) - You act like this is some silly game or something. All this romantic nonsense. Our wives have left us, you idiot. And they're gonna take us to the cleaners. - It's all your fault. If we hadn't married two sisters we wouldn't be in this mess. They were dykes, lesbo commie dykes, a disgrace. Bankrupt business and two limp dicks. It's over, we're finished. - It's our karma. - Oh, karma's ass.

How many cunts are in this fucking room anyway? Ay, you. You look like a nice cunt. (laughs) You guys wanna see my cock? Eh, what a bunch of crazies in here. Think I came here to fucking beat off?

Lou, why don't you talk to the Smith brothers while I console Pierre. Pierre, would you like to come into the office? This way. - Hey, just a minute now. You promised me free ass. - Well why don't you talk to Miss Zombie, I mean, Miss Zorby here. - Shit, she doesn't even talk. You better give God damn good head. - Pierre, why don't you just have a seat right here. Now, I know I can solve your problem. So two useless dicks huh?

I'm looking Yes I'm looking Hold on Pierre, not now I don't think I could ever explain this to the phone company I've got it Ok now, what was the address again? If our wives could see us now They would see two stiff dicks, those dyke freaks would be trying to eat out everything in sight. Your wife was never like this You fucked my wife? She was my girlfriend before she was your wife Did you say Riverside? What? Ok, I got it, goodbye We should have never swapped and got married Your wife gave great head My wife gave you head? You filthy bastard! I said goodbye Ok Pierre let it go - Hello? John. (instrumental music) - Ah, sorry folks, I'm afraid you missed it. - I told you to hurry. - How was I to know? - [Woman Standing] Don't leave, don't leave yet. - A horny bitch isn't she? - And she blames me. We're late because she wanted a quickie before we left the house. - Lou, Lou hurry, we've gotta go home. John called, Patty's at the house waiting. - Who's Patty? - My sister. John phoned the house and she answered. He's never met her before. Come on. - Look, I promised you decent cock tonight and I'm gonna deliver. - You can be so brutal. - And you love it, bitch. - Is he really that big? (shoes clicking) - [Penny] Patty. Oh Patty, I'm so glad to see you. - Penny. - [Penny] What is it? What is it? Patty, something's wrong. Is it your hemorrhoids? - Penny this is my girlfriend, Glenda. - How do you do Penny? Patty's told me so much about you and John. - [Penny] Patty, you're blind. Oh. - As they say, like a bat. - Penny, don't make a spectacle of yourself. Just relax please. - When did it happen? - Look, it's nothing to worry about. The doctors have assured me that the condition is just temporary. And I'll regain my sight just as soon as I get over, as soon as I get over... - [Penny] Get over what? - The shock, the sight of it. - [Penny] Of what? Patty, what did you see? - She hates to talk about it. It happened at the supermarket just last week. A flasher, right in the fresh fruit section, can you believe it? A flasher. Right in with the produce. - Blinded by a flasher? - It was so big. - Men are disgusting. - I was terrified. - It was savage. - Big as a salami. - 14 inches. - Where was the market? - He was still soft. - [Glenda] She's lucky, she went blind before he had an erection or the condition would've been permanent. - Blinded by a flasher. - I should've regained my sight by now but doctors said the experience was just so traumatic that I can't seem to be able to face it. Do you have a drink? - Sure, sure Patty. I'll fix you a drink. - Thank you. - 14 inches long. That was no flasher that was a fucking horse. - Look, I've got to help. I've got to do something. - Oh no, not again. - It's my duty to my sister. - What about your problem? John's coming home tonight. - (sighs) My sister is blind, she'll be walking around bumping into things for the rest of her life. She'll need a cane. - I know Penny, but if medical science can't do anything what can we do? (upbeat music) - Got it. I know it will work. She'll see again. (organ music) - [Penny] Who's she? - He said his wife ran off with the Frenchman so he picked her up and brought her over here. - Oh, okay. - Penny, this really isn't necessary. - I'm setting a certain mood. I want to try a little experiment. - Well, she can't see a fucking thing anyway. - It's the atmosphere that counts. I know what I'm doing I've had experience. Now Patty, as painful as it might be for you I want you to try to remember exactly how it happened. Relive the experience. - I don't like this idea. - I saw it on TV one time. This girl had been raped-- - Jesus, will you shut the fuck up. This is serious. - [Lou] I'm getting horny. - My God, you're all sex crazed. - [Patty] Shut up. Now where was I? Oh, okay. - Tell us, tell us what happened Patty. - Okay, I'll try. I'll try if you all just keep quiet for a minute. I'd gone to the store to get some prunes. - [Lou] Very tacky. - Anyway, I turned the corner and there he stood. He was fingering the cantaloupes, one at a time, just fingering them, each one. He was wearing a raincoat, it was a London Fog I think. He looked so sexy standing there and then he rolled around... And I just can't go on, it's just too painful. - Oh go on, you must tell us.
