Casa Loma: Canada's castle of ageless romance for tender years. It's battlements rise proudly over Toronto's skyline and yet its foundations were dug but 43 years ago. Then the baronial home of its builder, Sir Henry Pellatt, it now is a tourist mecca, operated by the Kiwanis Club of West Toronto, whose proceeds serve Canadian youth in countless ways. It also is where young Toronto dancers are on Friday and Saturday nights. Young as a 1911 structure may be, the stones in its walls are timeless. And tonight, with our cameras in the castle itself Showtime presents the Casa Loma that just might have been by starting with the Casa Loma of today. ♪ I met her dancing to the Castle Rock ♪ ♪ I held her tight and danced around the clock ♪ ♪ We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock ♪ ♪ She kissed me and I kissed my heart goodbye ♪ ♪ I felt like I was drifting 'cross the sky… ♪ Well, I never thought I'd live to see the day that Joyce's younger sister came in handy! First blind date I've had since I was 5 years old and went to a neighbor's birthday party! You'll like this guy Joan, Don Garrett-he's from Vancouver, real western type. - Oh, here he comes now-hi, Don! - Hi! And you must be Joan- John here has told me all about you. Well, I'm-I'm not Joan, I'm Joyce. Well, some of the world's best stories begin with mistaken identities. Now that you've met Joan… - Can I help you with your coat? - How chivalrous! Must be the Casa Loma influence. Gallantry is not dead! I can think of one gallant who should be dead. I wish this had happened in the middle ages. I would have given those squareheads something to make the castle rock! Ok, I'm coming. Coming… Oh, hi Audrey. How nice to see you, hon. How are you feeling? Oh, a little better, not quite there yet. No, no-don't do that. You don't want to have what I have. - Well I brought you some juice. - Oh, wonderful. - Oh... - So this is apple pear ginger lemon - OK. - And it should - This is going to be… - Once I get this off… There you go! You are stronger than you thought. Oh, thank you! Thank you. Mmm…yummy! Interested to see your reaction to it. - Mmm… - Good? Just what this bod needs! A good strong drink. Oh, man that's good. That would fix anything. Get rid of this thing in my throat, and my head, and my chest, and, Yeah, that's the worst, - when your head is foggy. - Yep. - I hate that. - Mmm! You make sure that you have this when you're not feeling well. Yeah. No, I do. - I was just napping a little bit. - Mmhm. If you're here long enough, you'll nap. And I-It's so funny... I think it's strange that I should be dreaming of something that happened 63 years ago. - Oh my gosh. - Oh, my goodness. What was the dream about? Well… I was doing a television show- - I used to do some singing, - Mmhm. - With a group called The Belle Singers. - Mm, I remember that. - Yeah… - But they did a TV show? We did, yes. We did both radio and TV. - And- - When?! - Over 60 years ago. - Oh my god. In the early '50s. But the choir was started way back in the '40s. Yeah. We've been around for a while. But anyway, we were doing this special… and, it was done at Casa Loma. Oh my gosh. It was sort of like a medieval show. Yeah-costume, all dressed up! - So you were in costume! - Yeah. - And uh, we did it all in costume, and… - Ok. Umm…there was a young man on the show. He was quite a good vocalist- he was a baritone. And his name was Don. And, uh…Radovich. Something like that. A baritone named Don Radovich- that's very, uh, dramatic! And, um…we were kind of drawn to each other, and started to date, and see each other, and, It was really very very nice, and, um... but unknown, you know, unbeknownst to me, my future husband was playing in the orchestra. Oh. And that would have been your pops. Yep! Yeah, that would have been your pops. But, um, I was introduced to him casually, and um, But then I was still seeing this young man, but, I know it sounds kind of funny, silly... - I don't think it sounds silly. - Well... Kind of wondering whatever happened to him. After we, you know, moved on. And, uh, just curious, you know, because he- one thing I do know, is that he moved out Western Canada, and he was doing some some jobs there, I think he even sang in the opera there. Oh wow. And he was, he was, uh, doing very well from what I understand. - And, uh... - Don Radovich... - Yeah, so... - Did you ever see the show? - No. - You never saw the show? No, because it was, it was, - live to air. - Oh... Yeah, oh-that was so... When I look back at it now it was funny, 'cause we'd be scurrying-everybody in the cast would be scurrying all over the studio, and there'd be wires and ropes and you know, a boom here and a boom there, and a lot of confusion. And if you made a mistake, you didn't stop. - Right, of course. - You just kept on going. But, you know I was thinking, maybe when you have a little bit of time, - you could go to the CBC and look up... - Yeah. - The show. - Yeah. - Yeah, they have an archive. - Sure. Hopefully they might still have that one - and you might be able to find it. - Wow. - Yeah well I'll... - Look it up... - But Audrey, I have one stipulation. - Yes? You're not to tell anybody. Becuase, I'll chase you out of town! No, I... I'd rather- - I was looking for a baritone named Don Radovich. But, this is just a little secret. - A little thing between you and me. - Yeah, that's fine. - We can maybe laugh about it, - Ok. And, have some fun with it. - Ok, so, what was the show called? - It was the Canadian General Electric... Oh, wow, alright. Show, yeah. Howard Cable was the conductor... of the orchestra. - And, um... - What's the name... - it was done at Casa Loma. - Yeah. Can you imagine? - And it was medieval? - It was a medieval show. At the beginning, it was like a couple arriving at a Friday night dance or something like that and then... I don't know, there comes this transformation between-the two girls are sisters, but the boys are friends, and they are our dates. - And it goes from there, and - Ok. Some people aren't happy with with who's with who, and it takes off from there. Anyway, if we find it... - I hope we do. - You'll be able to... - I can look at that. I'm sure, um... - Good. And then I guess, order it, - or something like that? - Well you phone me first. Don't uh, order it unless you find it. Well, of course you're not going to order it if you don't find it. - But, uh... - Leave it in my capable hands. Yeah, ok dear. Well, I'm going to get going. I just wanted to bring you that juice. Oh, well thanks for taking the time to do that, I appreciate it. You sound better than when I talked to you on the phone. Oh, yes. - Yesterday was a different day. - Yeah. Well, drink lots of water, get lots of rest. - You're already doing that though. - Yeah. And, uh, before you go, you can get a lemon loaf out of the freezer. - My favourite! - One of your favourites. - Thank you, Grandma. - You can always use that. Alright. Take care-do you have your fare for the bus? - Yes, thank you. - Ok. - Ok. - Pretty cold out? Yep, got my grizzly bear hat. Oh, I know you have- oh, boy. - Ok, bye grandma. - Love you dear, take care. - Bye! - Bye, be safe. - I will. - Ok. - Thanks! Bye! - Bye bye. Dear Mr. Radovich, my name is Audrey Benac. My grandmother is Joan Benac. Her maiden name was Joan Gilmore. My grandmother told me recently how the two of you starred in a television program for General Electric at Casa Loma, here in Toronto. She's never seen the episode, as it was live to air, and I'm currently trying to track it down for her in their archive. My grandmother's very well. She's still very lively: she still sings and is an avid swimmer. Double-sided, don't forget to turn the page, and we're ok! That's what I always do! In the 4th last bar, there's a second soprano note. Yeah, I know. How about that! Next week. So that's the end of that! Yeah, uh, could you take the Matteo Eventi please. Lately, she's been reflecting on her life. She thinks of you fondly, and wonders how you are doing, what your life has been since the two of you knew each other. I Googled you and was able to find your address on a website that listed your business. I hope you don't mind my being in touch. If you are interested, it would be nice for you to be in touch with her. Her telephone number is 647-501-1192. I hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards, Audrey Benac. 2, 3, and- Sopranos, could you sing it as if you're not scared stiff of that B there? 2, 3, and- Ok, you've got to have the notes sung and prepared before in your head, and prepared physically before you even go there. I'm already there. If I'm not, I'm going to be: I'm not going to be ready for it. Yeah, yeah, Ok. Arriving on the pitch. No, it's rhythmic: From "stay" to "spritius". Ready, and- Right on line. Ok, "tu a". Actually, that's a bad spot. From, uh, "fia...".

What do you mean? Well, Don showed up shortly before, about a couple of months before the wedding. And, uh, asked me to please postpone it for a while so that we could talk, and think over things again, and, um... That doesn't sound like much of an offer to me: "Stop your wedding so that we can... talk?" Well... I'm sure he was very nervous when he walked into my office and started this conversation with me, because I was so surprised. I had... I had no idea he was coming. I didn't have a phone call. And I just turned around from my- at that time it was a typewriter- can you imagine? I turned around at looked at the doorway, and there- there he was, standing there, and just- - I think he was very nervous. - Yeah. I know I started to shake, too, at the time. But, he wanted me to postpone the wedding, and try to take things in a different direction, but I said I couldn't do that now. I said I couldn't do that now. He waited too long. And, um, I told him that he needed to leave. Wow. And I-I could see that he was doing everything to hold himself, you know together, and he turned around and walked out of the office. And, it's a very long hallway. And I stood and watched him. And that's the last time I saw him. Monday, July 14th, 1952 on board The Scythia. Dearest Joan, Well here I am only a day from Le Havre, so I thought I'd better do a little writing. The trip from the onset was a marvelous one, just like a pleasure cruise. We left Toronto on a mobbed boat train 12:30 Sunday, and that was the worst part of our trip. It was so warm and crowded, and to top it off, we got into Montreal very late. It is a wonderful feeling to see the tugs pulling our ship away from the dock as people wave goodbye from the wharf. And it was a very beautiful day. Oh, what a life. From the time we left Quebec, all the way up the St. Lawrence, through the Belle Isle Straights, north of Newfoundland, and for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, almost two quarters of the way across the Atlantic, the water was smooth as glass. No sway, no rocking, just a slight swell. The days were warm, and blessed by brilliant sunshine, and the evenings were cool, with the full moon in the skies, for three nights. I have never seen anything as beautiful as a sunset or a sunrise on the ocean. Are you getting bored with my efforts? Have you been having a nice rest in Toronto? Must be very warm there, whereas here it is always fresh. On Friday night, the pond became an ocean, and the boat started to sway and swing like crazy. But thanks to God it hasn't had any effect on me at all. I guess I am just an old salt. As you can gather from the letter, I'm quite happy and satisfied. But there's only one thing missing, and that's you. I hope that this letter will find you in the best of health. Best wishes to the folks. So long for now. Love, Andy. Well, there are quite a few letters in here that were written when he was in Switzerland, studying with a group. He was there for two months. And, he was with people that he knew all of them were students of music, different instruments. And, let's see, what- see if I can find- Sure! This was- I wrote this on July 25th, 1952. And I say to him: Hi hon! It was real fine to get home last night and find your letter there. I certainly didn't think I'd hear from you until you arrived on the other side. By the time you read this, you will have completed your first crossing, and I hope without any ill effects. Trust that you didn't have to use your pills. That the time you spent on board was enjoyed. Since Wednesday here, the weather has cooled considerably, which is very welcome, believe me. Nothing very much has happened since you left here, except- that I miss you to no end already. Went out last Monday evening, and drove off 35 balls. But of course, there is still plenty of room for improvement. I gathered my energy afterwards, and with a chocolate sundae and a double malt! How about that! So consequently, I didn't feel too well Tuesday morning. I have slept so much this past week that I know that all of this energy stored up in me is going to have to be released soon. So I think this weekend, I shall do some vigorous swimming. Have been studying and practicing quite a bit the last few days, and hope I can keep it up. There was no way of trying to get anything done, the early part of last week. All I could think about was: Andy, ocean, Scythia, continents, and more Andy. Well, Andy, hope that you are well, and most of all, happy. Please look after yourself, while you're away because no precaution is too great. Am looking after myself for you and no one else anymore. You know exactly how I feel, and I hope you feel as strongly about the situation as I do. Hope you are comfortable where you are staying, and that the girls are not too pretty. And, did you have a haircut yet? How's the beard? Do you still shave every day? Well... Well, Andy, it's 11:30 and I'm sleepy, so I'll try and get some sleep. Our apartments are terrific, but there's nothing much we can do about the heat. Look after yourself, and don't get too stinko too often I haven't had one at all- strickly a lemonade girl. God bless you, darling. Always, Joan. You know, after so many years, it feels strange to read all this. Brings back so many memories and thoughts, and other people who were still around then, and aren't around anymore. But, anway. This is beautiful. You can- it's not silk, which is great, and you don't have to iron it. - Wow. - Well that's good, 'cause- You don't want to iron! The less maintenance, the better. Ok. - Shoulder pads! - Where'd they go? Ok, I'll straighten them out here. - Ok. - Alright. Gives me authority, I think. Well, it's a new look. Shoulder pads are coming back in. Women are rising up in the corporate world. At least that's what I hear. Wearing shirts like this, they will. So you can wear it in, or, if you're more casual, you wear it out. Or, you can belt it. That's an 80s look, isn't it? You're right. - It's a great colour on you, Audrey. - You think so? - It really is, oh yes. I do. - Fair skin. Want to try this on and see? Yeah! Lady in red. Your tail is hanging, but that's- There you go. Would you put some beads on? - Oh, I didn't- - No, maybe you don't want this. Well I can remember sometimes I didn't wear a necklace, I had a nice pin. Oh! I can see that. A nice gold pin, or something. Are you sure you're not going to miss these things if I take them away from you? Oh, no because I know you're taking them, I won't miss them. But only take it if you're going to use it... I mean if you have no intentions of using them, - No, it's really nice! - Tell me, I won't be heartbroken. I'd rather know it's being used than not, ok? Yellow is very very hard for some people to wear, and wear it comfortably, - Yellow and orange– - and enhance their looks! Oh, you're still the same, you always take the shortcuts. Ever since you were a little girl! Here- That's so harsh! Just because I didn't do a button. Yeah, just a button! Save yourself time. Ok, take this off. You're designing a whole look for me. Well, what do you think Audrey? Do you think this is a yes or a no? - Yeah! - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah yeah! Yeah. Ok, then you can use that bag. Is there anything else here do you want to try on today? - I think-I think this is plenty. - Ok. Okie dokie. Well, I'm sick of your magic. Now you listen to me, young lady! Here's one for your book of magic! And here's one for spoiling a perfectly good love affair! And here's one for that bunch of flowers! And here's one for- why... you're crying. But witches don't cry! But I'm not a witch. I'm a girl! So I see. Well it took you long enough to find out. You're always in a bad light. These castles. Say, I have tickets to the jousting tournament - next Saturday, and I'd- - I'd love to. It's really incredible to be able to see you. You had the most beautiful voice. Somebody else has it now. But, um, it's it's, in a way, it's hard to see this now but in another way, it's you know, it's interesting. And you see how far we've come, and, you wonder where everybody is now, - Grandma? - what they're up to. Do you think that, um, here, hang on. Do you think that that man and that man, are the same person? Everybody ages differently, I guess, I don't know. I would look at this and I would say, no. No? No. I think it could be. Just look at that hairline. And the jaw. I mean, Because he would have lost weight in this part of his face. And he wouldn't be as- broad. I think it could be. Audrey, I know you would like it to be, but I, I- I feel deep down that it's not. It's not him. It's not Don. But Well, if this isn't your Don Radovich, I wonder who this guy is. Well... hopefully he belongs to somebody. Your first communion day, I don't think started off that smoothly. I think that Starting from the time in the morning when you had to start to prep for church and whatnot, you were getting getting your beautiful dress on that your mother had made for you and it was so, so pretty. And, uh, you were just- couldn't believe it, at that age, having a bad day. Really bad day. And you were putting your mother through all kinds of difficulty and she wanted to fix your hair. And, um, you just wouldn't go along with anything that she said. Wouldn't stand still, so she could get your hair done, and whatnot. But anyway, she perservered, and you ended up looking quite quite pretty that day. I won't forget it. I have a lovely, lovely picture of you, that day. Actually, it's in your bedroom, I took it just before we left for church, I guess. And, of course you looked like an angel. And, the ceremony of course was beautiful, and after the ceremony, the family and everyone, oh gosh. And then we went back to the house, and, we had a lovely little party. It was a gorgeous day, I remember the weather was beatiful. And, uh, you just ran out of the house, ran out into the garden in the backyard like a a bird who had just been set free and it was like you were released. Those are the kind of things that I like to remember.
