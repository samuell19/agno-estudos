There's nothing left to sign, right? - No, Sir. - Okay. Sir. Sign it. The inauspicious hour begins in ten minutes. Listen, Shaji. It was Abhilash Sir who helped me the most with my voluntary retirement. I know that it was he who brought you here, as well. Recently, I had a chance to work with him. Because of that, I got 5 times the amount which I'll get from my retirement fund, within a month. So, just do what Abhilash Sir asks you to do. It's very rare that we get someone like the one who's in D-Block. D-Block is a secured block, right Sir? It's empty now. Nowadays, there is no one who's worthy enough to be in that block. We set up a cell over there as per his wishes. And we jammed the camera. We provided AC, bed and a coffee maker. And his food and clothes keep coming regularly from outside. Come. I had promised Abhilash Sir that I will introduce you to him. Come. There should not be any lack of facilities, Shaji. In my entire service, I haven't seen any prisoner who is as dangerous as him. Sitting here, he can do anything outside. We all have families to take care of, right? You don't have to worry at all, Sir. Abhilash Sir wouldn't send me to replace you for nothing, right? You have a point there! Good morning, Sir. Sir... I'm getting relieved today. This is the new superintendent. Shaji. Come forward. Good morning, Sir. Sir, ADGP Abhilash Sir asked me to give this to you. [He is my man. You can trust him - Abhilash] Just let me know whatever you need, Sir. I'll take care of it. You too, just let me know whatever you need, Shaji. Thank you, Sir. How are these girls related to you? I live next to their house, Sir. These girls don't have any relatives. It's just the two sisters. When I didn't sense any sounds or movement in their house, even after it was late in the night, I went over there to check. What's your name? Agnes. And the names of the girls? The elder one is Vidhya. She works as a food delivery girl. The younger one is Kavita. She is studying in 7th grade. Do they usually come home together in the evening? Kavita has tuition classes on Mondays and Thursdays. Vidhya picks her up on the way home. Normally, they reach home by 7:15 p.m. But now... What's the update? Where is it? Vinitha, we need to go to a place now. Bring her along. - What is it, Sir? - You come along with us. Come. I'll tell you. - Come, Aunty. - What is it, dear? It's nothing, Aunty. Sarath, Rupesh! Come with us. Sir! Careful. Did anything happen to them? There is nothing to worry. Come! - Have you got the location? - Yes, sir. - Go quickly. - Sir. No. Don't worry. Just get in, Aunty. I wonder what happened to them. When did you get the information? It was reported by two guys who passed this way. We have held them here. - Call them, Hamid. - Okay, sir. - Oh no! Isn't it their vehicle? - Please stand aside, Chechi. - It's okay, Aunty. - What happened to them? It's okay. We'll find out. I'm the Councillor of their ward, Sir. I know the girls who own this vehicle. - What happened? - Just a minute. I'm getting a call. - Was it an accident? - Just a minute. Sir. They are missing, Sir. Two girls. Their scooter is lying on the road, two kilometres away from their house. Yes. I checked all the nearby hospitals. No accident cases were reported anywhere. Seems like we have a problem, Sir. About two hours ago, the world came to know about the incident which shook Kerala. Police were searching for the sisters who went missing last night. But at around 7 a.m. in the morning, some people found the lifeless body of this girl in the bushes. The girl was cruelly raped before her death. Last night, this girl and her sister, who's studying in 7th grade, were kidnapped by the attackers, while they were heading home. The younger girl has been found under extreme critical condition... from a deserted place, one kilometre away from here. The younger girl has been shifted to Ernakulam General Hospital. Police have completed the preliminary procedures and... are now shifting the body to Ernakulam General Hospital. Protests are blazing against the incident which shook the conscience of Kerala. Protests are rising from different corners of the country on social media. The guys who did this should be killed! They should be killed! There is nothing less than that. They should be killed! My opinion is that the guys who did this should be killed in a much more cruel way. My prayer is that no one else should undergo what those girls went through. Whom should we talk to? Who will hear us? The Chief Minister is evaluating the progress of this investigation himself. In Kochi, the girl who fell prey to the attackers' brutality and was killed... is a symbol. I'm requesting that the sister who lived self sufficiently, in spite of extremely poor living conditions, and ultimately fell prey to sexual abuse and got killed, should be called "Dheera" (The brave one) from now on. Dheera's sister... will be provided with the best medical treatment... and she will be brought back to normal life. To investigate the incident... and for bringing the culprits to justice... an investigating team lead by Christopher, the Head of Division for Preventing Crime Against Women (DPCAW) has been assigned. [Indistinct chatter] Sir! Sir! Sir, any clue about the culprits? Sir, what's the status of the investigation? Move! Move! Move aside! Sir! Please talk to us before you go, Sir! Namaste. I'm the Councillor of their ward. I've been with them since yesterday. The girl's condition is quite bad, Sir. They said it's unlikely that she will survive. Even if she survives, her condition will be worse. Please don't spare those criminals, Sir. Sir, Christopher sir has come. [Salutations for "Dheera" Arrest and punish the culprits immediately] Moving on to an important breaking news. The culprits in the Kochi sisters' rape case have been nabbed by the police. Sudeep Rajan, the main accused was nabbed by the police... while he was trying to leave the State. Immediately after which his accomplices were nabbed by the police, using force. The main accused, Sudeep Rajan, and his accomplices Chambakkara Kannan, Rajeesh and Sunny have been arrested by the police. On the 21st, that girl came to your flat to deliver food. Isn't that true? She had come there. And on that day, you groped her, right? Your neighbours told us... that the girl started screaming then. Now, tell us. We have all the details which prove that you stalked her and harassed her. Well, it just happened, Sir. What next? Tell me that, Sir. What next? What will happen next? Tell me! What do you want to know? No, Sir. Don't hit me, Sir. It will be a problem for you. I too have rights, right? We know that... you come from a rich and influential family. If you are behind bars for some time, your lawyer will take care of the rest. Well, if you tell us what happened that day, we can conclude this formality. - Come! - Leave us! Please leave us! - Leave us! - Lift her! Sister! Let go of us! Sister! Come on! Sister! Please let us go! I had longed for her as soon as I saw her, right? I asked her. She did not oblige. But she disgraced me! She complained to the apartment association and the police. That really provoked me, Sir. That's why I... Do you know the age of her younger sister? But I didn't know that her sister would be with her, right? What can I say? It just happened, Sir. If she had obliged when I asked her, would any of this have happened? - You...! - Britto! Sir. We're transferring them to the Central Prison... due to security reasons. Collect the evidence late at night, when no one is around. Get down. Walk! Walk! Come! - Get me the inquest report. - Sir. Make them stand over there. Open it! Sir! Close it! Move those aside! - We can't do that! - You don't know who I am! That's my son! - Move aside! - We will see! Mind you! Move aside! Where did you dump the body? Over there. - I think it was over there. - Show it. Proceedings are going on, Sir. Sir. Note it down, Vinitha. Sir. - Shall I call the legislator, Sir? - Wait. Your son is with us. I'll switch on the loudspeaker. You can talk now. I'm really stressed, Dad. This place is teeming with policemen. They will do something to me. Don't worry. I'm right here. No one will harm you. I'm here, right? That's enough. Give it to me. Sudeep, you can escape from there if you want to. This is a game between our superior officer and your Dad. What is this guy saying? Come on! Stop there! The criminals who assaulted the sisters in Kochi, were shot dead by investigating officer Christopher Antony during evidence collection. Social media and the general public are celebrating this act by the officer. Christopher Sir did the right thing. They deserve to be killed! There's at least one person to react to such brutalities! Being a mother of two girls, Christopher sir is equal to God for me. We need a hundred more officers like Christopher Sir. Christopher Sir is truly a hero. I wish everyone becomes like Christopher Sir. Christopher Sir should continue this. A policeman can shoot and kill anyone. If such a situation prevails, it's not good for the judicial system. The people who committed this cruelty to those girls... are very influential in the society. All of us know what will happen if they are brought to court. How else should we react to such people? What else do they deserve? A fair trial is mandatory. Justice should not be enforced by killing or by committing extra judicial murder. Absolutely. The latest breaking news about this incident is that... the High Court has asked the Government to conduct an enquiry... and submit a report at the earliest. Now that the Court has issued an order, there's no need to ponder over it, right? - You can start the enquiry. - Sir. We will set up a team today itself. Good. This officer should be suspended during the enquiry period, Sir. This is not the first time he's killing someone, right? Suspension is not possible, Madam. Aren't you seeing what's happening on social media? State and Central Ministers, Parliament members, political leaders, super stars... All of them have put up posts, showering praises on him. - Isn't it? - Yes, Sir. Celebrating extra judicial manslaughter like this... It is undemocratic, Sir. The Home Secretary need not teach me about the implications of his action. Sorry, Sir. Let him go on leave during the enquiry period. - What do you say, DGP? - Sir. Let's assign ADGP Askar to handle the supervision of the enquiry. But, investigating officer... I suggest... should be a lady. Okay. That would be good. Let the investigation have a feminist approach. Whom do you have in mind? Have a seat, Sulekha. Thank you, Sir. - Good to go? - Yes. You team has been hand-picked. So, no worries. Make sure the enquiry is absolutely fair and transparent. NHRC have begun their enquiry, parallelly. I know, Sir. During this enquiry period, you should just consider the legality alone. Plain legality to the letter. Just ignore the so-called media frenzy... and populous hearsay. Yes, Ma'am. All available data regarding the police shoot-out is in this folder. Plus, there's a hard disk containing some visuals. Check them out. I'm not going to open these folders now. An investigation that's confined only to this current shoot-out... No, that's not my agenda! Well, I'm sure about one thing. The last finding from this investigation... will be that Christopher Sir is indeed guilty! Whatever may be the justifications that are laid out, and whatever may be reasons that are uncovered, police vigilantism is a bloody crime and that's my conviction. So, I want his story. History of Christopher. Where do we begin? If you want to know his history, you will have to go back, by many many years. The second night of the most terrifying communal riot in Kerala. Move aside! Come quickly, Bala. Today is our best chance. We won't get such an opportunity again. Chechi! Shantha Chechi! - Who is it? - We've been sent by Antony Chettan. Where is your son? My husband and son went to see if they could get some rice and grocery. - Is that so? - Who are you? We will tell you who we are. Move aside, Chechi! Oh no! Mom! Hold her! - Let go of me! - Dear! Come over here! Stay calm! Let go of me! - Mom! - Dear! My daughter! Shut the door. Who are you? What do you want? - Let go of me! - Who are you? - Hit him! - Let go of me! Let go of my hand! Hold him! Hold him! Smash his head! Drag him inside. Attention everyone! Please cooperate with the steps taken by the police for your safety. If you come across criminals among the people shifted to the camp, inform the police officers immediately. Move forward. Vetrivel IPS. The brave officer appointed by the then CM... to bring an end to the riots, using his iron fists! The Godfather of police encounters. Keep a close watch over everyone until the situation is clear. - I'll be over there. - Okay, Sir. - Who are you guys? - Sir... They have destroyed our homes there. We're tired of running, Sir. Can you take us to the camp, Sir? Hey, give them black tea. After drinking the black tea, join this queue. - Okay, Sir. - Here you go. No need to worry now. Dude, I think we're safe now. Yeah, I think so too. - Sir. - Yes. When this vehicle reaches there, the school camp will become full, Sir. Send the next vehicle to Mambaram Cooperative Bank. Sir. I've informed the president... to accommodate everyone coming in the vehicle. Move forward, Chechi. Come on! Quick! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Leave me! - Hey! Who are you? What's your name? What's your name? Tell me! Christopher. Christopher? You are not part of either sides! Why did you try to kill them? It was them! It was them, Sir. Mom! Dad! Sister! Sister! Come on! Run! The most risky click of my entire career! My newspaper didn't publish this photo. The editorial policy was against publishing anything that would escalate the riot. Afterwards, many came... asking for this photo. They offered good money too. I didn't give it. Have you ever shown this photo to Christopher Sir, Vasuvettan? Many have asked me for this photo. You can take it if you want, Sir. No, Vasuetta. If I close my eyes, I still feel like I am that 14-year-old. Even today, what's buzzing in my ears, louder than that gun shot... is the wailing of a boy who had lost everything! Thank you. Christopher's education was overseen by... Vetrivel, who had moved to Delhi on Central deputation. When Christopher joined the IPS, Vetrivel intervened, to get him his first posting in Bijapur district of Madhya Pradesh. Let me go! Save me! Shut up, you wretch! Shut up! India Today published a cover story with just the photo of the tribals who had come to give him a farewell. Now, go and meet Madam Beena. Once your meeting with her is over, let's meet again. Okay, Sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, Madam. Sir. S.P. Venkitesh. Christopher. My colleagues. D.S.P. Varadarajan, C.I. Karthik, Inspector Vadivukkarasi. You got the details regarding the incidents, right? Yes. - Ismail. - Sir. Sir, until now there have been 13 accidents... in a span of 21 months. 34 people have died... and there were 3 survivors. Didn't you get anything significant from them? Sir, the survivors were mortally injured. Their heads were brutally smashed. Lethal blow with some heavy objects and they were looted too. Blunt force trauma. Basically, this is a series of... highway robberies. Yes, Sir. In the Pondicherry-Velankanni route, there is a deserted area for 12 kilometres. One side of the route is a dense forest valley. They have attacked the vehicles, with accurate planning. If you get stuck there, it's a death trap. Killings and looting happen there. When the idea of a Special Task Force came up, it was me who suggested your name, Christy. I had to pull many strings to bring you here. Okay. We will give you a heads-up tomorrow. - Sure. - Here itself, at the same time. Okay, Sir. Sir. All the 13 accidents occurred within this 4-kilometre-radius. The autopsy report says that inside every deceased person's body, there were undigested food particles. Each one of them had eaten North Indian Dhaba food. This particular Dhaba which is around 1.7 kilometres behind this place... was everyone's stopover. We already checked that possibility, Sir. That Dhaba is run by an elderly husband and wife. And they are clean. They might not be directly involved in it. This Dhaba might be the spot where the robbers pick and choose their targets. So, what's next? I need a van. A van that banks use for filling money in ATMs. In all probability, these guys must be heavily armed. When we go there under the disguise of security personnel, they must be prepared for a showdown. Vadivukkarasi, are you good with guns? Yes, Sir. Your team will have to join the action, not later than 10 minutes... after it begins. Done, Sir. - Hello. - Hello. We just reached here. Tomorrow morning, we will go to Velankanni, fill up the cash in the ATM and return safely. Sir! Look! [prayers] Ever since his wife died, it has just been him and his daughter, Sir. Since it was an inter-caste marriage, his relatives were not in good terms with him. His father's brother and his cousin have come now... to take care of the funeral ceremony. This cousin is also in the police force. But I don't think he will accept the daughter. His wife and relatives are dead against it. The daughter will be in a dire situation. I have never seen Christopher being so tender, before or after that. Ismail meant a lot for him. He looked so vulnerable. Though he said that he doesn't have the mental stability for a marriage, I forced him to agree to it. Things were fine for some time. Just for some time. Chackochayo! Whatever you may have had so far, only now have you become perfect. Being a Rajya Sabha MP is no mean feat! I was afraid whether Thomas would get that seat. But Mathew Sir kept his word. He didn't keep his word for nothing. I gave 5 crores to him. Well, when is your daughter taking charge as the Collector here? - Next week. - Okay. - Dear! - Yes. Why doesn't Christy come and mingle with everyone? He went to the room upstairs. You know him, right Dad? He is a peculiar type. Leave it, Dad. As you say! Have a drink, man! I am already vexed seeing this pompous function. If I drink now, I might lose it! What is this? By any standard, Chackochan is the best father-in-law an IPS officer can get. You should be fortunate enough to enjoy it. You don't have it. I too have a father-in-law. Co-operative Bank Manager Karunakaran Nair. I had to fall at his feet and beg him, to buy me a car. A second hand ambassador car. Autoland engine. There's always something wrong with it! Crap! Abhi! - Have dinner before you leave. - Okay. You go ahead. I'll come along. Okay. You guys carry on. Hey, I'm leaving. We got a tip-off. Okay then. Carry on. If we are lucky, we will strike the headlines tomorrow. Is this how you go for a combing? You are drunk! Not drunk. I'm in high spirits. Glad that I could meet everyone after coming back from Delhi. - Okay then. - Dad! I'm heading out. That's not fair! Stay here. There are all these guests here, right? It's not that. I have to go. I had promised to be there, much in advance. It's a huge deal. I'll be back soon. - Hey, take the Benz. - Okay. She never listens to me! Mom, I have an exam tomorrow. I am going home. Oh! You and your exam! I won't be able to do all this alone! Help me out, girl! You don't understand anything I say! Hey! Oh no! Sir! Let her go and study if she has exams. You just do what you can. I'll tell the folks downstairs. - Okay. - What exam do you have tomorrow? Accountancy. - All the best! - Thanks! She's a really bright student, Sir. Well, the party was a big bore, right? - Yes. - Let me freshen up. Yes, Abhilash. Beena, we got a tip-off today. From Fort Kochi. A cocaine party. We have cordoned the hotel. - We've seized huge quantities of the substance as well. And, there are around 12 girls in this property... who were tricked and brought here from random places. Two of them are minors. The party's main host arrived a bit late. He is in our hands now. It's Sebastian. One sec. Abhi, hush it up. Please clean it up, for God's sake! Don't say anything back to me. Any trouble from media? So far, nothing. - But... - No but! You have to do this for me. Abhi... please! I'll pass the phone to Dad. He will tell you what to do. - Beena... I... - Dad! - Dad! - What is it, dear? It's Abhilash. Tell me, Abhilash. Chackochaya... There's a small complication. I'm leaving now. - Dad... - Don't worry, dear. I'll handle this. That's how a friction developed between Christopher and me. So, did you abort that night's operation, Sir? Beena's pleading, and Chackochan's money power, along with political pressure, right from the CM to Mathew Sir. I am not Christopher, not to succumb to all this. What happened to those girls? We dropped everyone back to the addresses they gave. Chackochan arranged everything. He also gave Rs. 10,000 each to those girls. A clean settlement. Why are you staring like this? How can I salute you now, Sir? I can understand your indignation. But 90% of the officers whom you salute in the department... are worse than me! So, your salute can be the same as earlier. Hierarchy is hierarchy. That's the only truth in the system. You get me? Yes, Sir. Though we don't agree on so many things, I do have some affection and respect for Christopher. A tinge of admiration that one feels towards a rebel. That's why I opened up like this. Let's come to the matter. After that incident, Christopher ended his friendship with me. After that, I met him around 5-8 months later. The missing case of three girls in Kochi which I was handling then, was transferred to the Crime Branch. Christopher, who had shifted to Kerala by then, was heading the investigation. So, he came and met me officially. Any other briefings? Anything specific? Yes, but not now. In the evening. Let's meet at Hotel Sea Lord. Hey, if I had done all that back then, - it was for your family, right? - Abhilash... You replaced your second-hand ambassador with a Ford Escort. You bought a new apartment at Marine Drive. The work you do can be called by many names. But that would be a big insult to those who do that work! This? This girl is one among the ones who went missing. Annie... and that's her mother with her. It's been 54 days since my daughter went missing, Sir. But when I see you, I feel that God has not deserted me, Sir. Do you still go to that house for work? Your wife's house, right? No, Sir. I stopped going there. But Chackochan Sir was very fond of my daughter. After her study time, she was asked to look into the accounts of one of his companies. He used to pay Rs. 1,000 per month for that. I want my daughter back, Sir! I am living this life only for her. When you suggested that we meet here, I thought you'd have a drink. Why are you so serious? Have a drink. After you got him out of that case, did my brother-in-law get into any other issue? Were any other crimes registered in his name? Not as far as I know. What is it? That missing girl whose photo you showed me that day... Annie. That girl is your father-in-law's... She was a part-time accountant at his crusher unit. Her mother... used to work at Chackochan's house as a maid, for around 5-8 months. Christy, what are you digging at? The three missing girls didn't know each other. That's your inference, right? Yes. That's the truth. Someone who knew these three girls... or someone who has some connection with them... A dangerous sex maniac... who is a substance user also. Have you thought of such a possibility? Who is on your mind? Four months ago, a guy threw his pet dog into the crusher, while he was high on drugs. Four workers witnessed it. One of them, named Prakash Babu... shared this story to his brother Vimal Babu... who runs a local tabloid called "Twilight". Chackochan paid money and bought all the 3,000 copies... of that evening's "Twilight" which carried that story. He paid Rs. 2 Lakh to Vimal Babu too. Bank statements, confessions, transaction details... I've got all of it. But what does it have to do with the missing girls' case? Public doesn't trust the police... because people like you are part of the force, Abhilash. I didn't drink today so that I could say it in such a civilised way. Sir! Move! Move aside! Everyone move out! Brother, why are you here with the police? What's the problem? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, let go of me! Move aside! Sir! Hair and body particles. Come on, walk. Hey! He told us everything! Get inside! Get in! He's my younger brother after all, Christy. You know better than anyone about the bonding between siblings. Well, I was not comparing. Dear! Just because you put my son behind bars, nothing is going to happen! But if you had said a word to me before arresting him, I would have paid money to those girls' families. An amount of your choice! Now, look what happened. I had to pay that amount to this Advocate Dhanapalan. Abhilash, come on! This lawyer will bring my son out... on the very day he's produced in court, after police custody period. When my daughter said that she wants to marry you, a person with no pedigree, I agreed only because of the three letters - IPS. I thought you would be of some use to me, some day or the other. Let my son get released. Rest can wait until then. Listen, Abhilash Sir. Our version is that... Sebastian has severe bipolar disorder. He was a regular drugs user. And he is undergoing psychiatric treatment under Dr. Thomas John. During totally unexpected occasions, he unleashes bouts of violence. Such a medical report... and the evidence supporting it. I'm going to submit these in court tomorrow. When you bring him out of the Police Club to produce him in court, I have asked Sebastian to act violent. Just to put up a show in front of the media. You should give strict instructions to your cops not to react to it. Don't be afraid, Chackochan Sir. Sebastian will definitely get bail. Government should enforce justice! Chacko M.P. must resign! The political influence of Parliament member Chacko Kallatt... who is also the leader of most prominent ruling constituent party... will save his son, who's the accused. The families of the deceased girls believe so. The defendant has submitted evidence and documents in court... showing that the accused Sebastian has a mental disorder. According to legal experts, the court might take that into consideration... and give some relaxations to the accused's custody terms. The accused is the brother-in-law of Crime Branch S.P. Christopher, who is also the investigating officer. Christopher is an officer with an impeccable track record. While some are praising him for the honesty he showed in arresting Sebastian, despite being his brother-in-law, others are saying that Christopher should be relieved from this case, based on moral grounds. Arrest Sebastian! Arrest Sebastian! Sir! Sir! Sir! [slogans continue] Sir. He took my daughter away... and killed her, Sir! I had brought her up so well! Let go of me, you dogs! ****** Move aside! Pigs! - Let go of me! - Catch him, Sir! Let go of me! Sons of *****! Let go of me! F***** morons! Pigs! Catch him! You sons of whores! Let go of me! You...!! You killed my daughter! Didn't you? You...!! You...!! With that, he lost everything. Beena got separated from him. The only company he had amidst his loneliness... was Amina, late Ismail's daughter. A five-year-long legal battle. Finally, the court declared that he wasn't guilty and he got back into the service. When Christopher rejoined service, he was made to stay away from Law & Order. And it was a year back, that was given the charge of 'Division for Preventing Crime Against Women', upon the Chief Minister's special interest. And that turned out to be like this! Anyway, you should read the court judgement regarding Sebastian's death. It will be helpful. Hello, Ma'am. It's me, Anil. Yes. Tell me. There are two guests at Christopher Sir's house right now. One of them, is Advocate Amina Ismail, Ma'am. That activist lawyer? Yes, Ma'am. The other person is that retired engineer from Public Works Department. Salam Muhammad. Did you get the guy, Ma'am? Last week, there was a petrol attack against his daughter. That girl is in critical condition at the hospital, right? Yes, Ma'am. Anil... Listen. I want to know. I want to know every move of Christopher Sir, hereafter. This Amina... She's almost like a daughter to him. If she has taken a petrol attack victim's father... to meet Christopher Sir... There is something brewing. Keep me updated, Anil. Sure, Ma'am. Sure. She was born after I crossed 42 years of age, Sir. We got her after we went for the Hajj pilgrimage. Binu, son of Sudharshan, the liquor baron. He proposed to Suhra, around four months back... with wrong intentions. She said 'No'. He harassed her continuously. I made her file a complaint at the nearby police station. Sudharshan's men came and settled the issue. But... I didn't know that he'd have such a vengeance in his mind. - Dear. - Yes. - Come back early today. - I'll try, Dad. - We have to go to your uncle's house. - I'll come. - Don't be late. - I won't be late, Dad. - Okay? - Yes. - Suhra! - What? You didn't take your water bottle. She is so forgetful! My dear!! Doctors told us that... she won't survive. She expressed a wish to me. She wants to meet you, Sir. She used to say that she wished all policemen were like you. Before my daughter passes away you should come, Sir. You should meet her. He will come. Hello. Ma'am. They've reached the hospital where Suhra is admitted. Yes. Suhra... Suhra... It's me, Christopher. You will be alright. Ladies, especially girls... should be able to say 'No' to anything or anyone, that or whom they don't like. It's the proclamation of their independence. We can't, sir. Girls cannot afford to say 'No', Sir. Sir... My daughter... I want a 24-hour vigil on Mr. Christopher. Yes, Ma'am. Binu Sudharshan's life is in serious threat. Christopher Sir's basic degree is in IT Engineering. He developed our Cyber Policing... single-handedly, since 2009. I'm sure... he will locate Binu Sudharshan... and something serious is going to happen. He is inside his house, Ma'am. Keep watching. Sure, Ma'am. Lights are getting switched on and off, Madam. Tell me, Anil Ma'am, I've sent you a feed from traffic control. Christopher Sir has moved to the airport now. Shit! One minute. Anil, rush to the airport. And yeah, details of all flights, and their destinations... Domestic and international... Their passenger lists. Collect all of these! Check if Christopher Sir's name is on any of those lists. I'm coming to the airport right now. Sure, Ma'am. Sure. I've collected all the footage of Christopher sir entering, Madam. This way. Come on, play it. Sir. The aircraft left to Hyderabad. Took off 20 minutes ago. Aircraft owned by VJ Group of companies. - VJ Group of companies. - Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. Welcome. Sir, this is Sulekha. Sulekha... Christopher doesn't have any travel restrictions. He is a senior IPS officer on leave. If he goes to Hyderabad, does it mean that... he has gone to murder Binu Sudharshan whom you think is hiding there? You're going overboard. Sir, can't you alert the Hyderabad commissioner? Just to have an eye on him. Rubbish! Damn it! The Chief Minister, DGP and Home Secretary have arrived. They have decided to summon Christopher who's facing an enquiry in the Kochi encounter cases. Today morning, the body of the accused in the Kalamassery petrol attack case, Binu Sudharshan, was found from a deserted building in Panaji, Goa. Ever since Christopher's name came up connected to Binu Sudharshan's death on the news, Christopher's name is being celebrated again and again, on social media and in educational institutions. Some youngsters with similar banners and placards have come here, as well. Along with this, there's a strong protest against self enforced justice through vigilantism. Based on the evidence, Christopher should be taken into custody and interrogated. This is the demand put forward by around 50 social activists, in a joint statement. He has become a headache. He went to Hyderabad in an aircraft owned by VJ Group of companies, based out of Hyderabad. After three hours, along with VJ Group of companies chairman, Venkiteshwar Rao and his family... straight to Goa, by the same aircraft. Rao and Christopher are old friends. When Rao received a threat from a gang, it was Christopher who sorted it out for him, when he was in Secunderabad. Sir, there was a private get-together hosted by Venkateshwar Rao... at Hotel Leela in Goa. On some photos posted on their Facebook and Instagram pages, we can see Christopher sir's presence too. I have a strong suspicion that... even this whole function was arranged by Rao, upon Christopher sir's request. He wanted to be in Goa... with a rock solid alibi. We want justice! We want justice! Suhra needs justice! We want justice! Suhra deserves justice! Long live Christopher sir! Long live Christopher sir! We want justice! The accused in the Kalamassery petrol attack case, Binu Sudharshan, who fled to Goa. Sulekha is saying that you are the one behind his death. Do you have anything to say? Excuse me, Sir. There is a small correction. Since the testimonies of the victim and her parents were not trustworthy, Binu Sudharshan has no connection to this Petrol attack case, as per the findings of the investigation team. - Is it? - Nothing conclusive, Sir. Investigation is progressing. Sir, I was in Goa to attend a private function, for the past two days. Apart from that, if there is anything which connects me to the death of the said person, I'm ready to co-operate with Goan Police who are investigating this case. Oh! Goan police! Jurisdiction! Let that be. This girl who was attacked... Suhra... Did you go and meet her at the hospital? I met her. She said she wants to meet me. So, I went there. Why did that girl want to meet you? If every girl who's attacked, trusts people like you alone, what are the police and courts for, Sir? There are many committed officers like Sulekha in the police force, Sir. But right now, they all are... worthless, as far as the general public is concerned. Their only hope is a trigger-happy... insane cop! It's really sad, Sir! Among the messages coming to the social media inbox of the police, 80% are for you. 'Christopher should be reinstated into service.' 'Christopher should investigate all the important cases.' 'Culprits should be handed over to Christopher.' The morale of the police is being destroyed, Christopher. Do you have anything to say, Christopher? Draft on a national policy on criminal justice... submitted to the Central Home Ministry in 2003. Yes, Sir. Submitted by a committee headed by Justice Malimath. The Judiciary system in India is facing two huge problems. More than 10,000 criminal cases that are indefinitely delayed, without judgement. Secondly, the situation where the accused in even the most brutal crimes... go unpunished because of money and corruption. Sir, in Kerala where there are 172 IPS officers, I'm not not very proud that people are sending messages addressed to me alone, to the social media handles of the police. In fact, I'm embarrassed, Sir. Why just me? The reason why people are forgetting the remaining 171 names including you, is the failure of this law enforcing system which includes you and me. The system has become sterile. It doesn't deliver any more, as... the committee report rightly points out. In such a desperate situation, towards a mad cop who's forced to wield the gun with no other way in sight, the public may develop a liking. They might even develop an admiration without any logic. It is based on such admirations and likings, that the people trust a leader, vote for his party and make them win the elections. No matter who did it, Binu Sudharshan got the death he deserved. When Suhra closes her eyes for the last time, Suhra should feel that justice was served. For that, she will thank God. The value I give to that gesture... I haven't given that value to any judicial system. And never will I, either. People who have seen this world through the tears of helpless victims like Suhra... will have some absurd 'Rights', Sir. If a communist like you don't understand that, who else can, Sir? Sir, please. Please, sir! [indistinct questions by the media] What do you say about the delay in justice in cases related to violence against women? One response... Just one response! Justice delayed is justice denied! Yes, Sister. You got the prayer book, right? Suresh Brother, shall I distribute these notices at the next road? Okay, Brother. Sister, Praise the lord! Please read this, sister. All your problems will get resolved. I am not at all into this. If you move that vehicle, I could leave. Don't be blasphemous, sister. Satan is amongst us. I'm not being blasphemous. I had seen you recently in the court. How many court cases do you have now? Kidnapping, murder... You have the whole bunch, right? That's all in the past, right sister? Last year, I went for a spiritual retreat and got reformed. HE shall take care of the cases. So be it. That vehicle... We will move it. Praise the lord! - Brother, please move that vehicle. - Okay, Suresh Brother. You may leave, sister. Hello Mr. Perera! In all possibility, you might become the Newsmaker of the year. Come on. I'll tell you the rest. By the by, will you lose your job? I don't care even if I lose it. But frankly, I feel really regretful about it. I was the one who brought Salam Haji to you, right? And you went and met Suhra because of that, right? But Sir, I never expected you to... Let me make some black tea. What have you brought here? Rice pancake and beef. Go, have a shower quickly. I'll set up the table by then. I'll shower later. Okay. Well, why aren't you attending your brother's calls? He was complaining to me about it. He is not my brother. He is my cousin-brother, right? Cousin-brother is wrong English. Cousin. Let it be. Cousin, it is! It was when my Dad passed away that I needed love and protection. He kept away fearing his wife and relatives then. And he's showing affection now, calling me when no one's around. What for? His situation was such, right? Well, what's with the rice pancake and beef? Anything special? Jokes apart, I'll tell you the reason I came here. Sitaram Trimurthi. He is the head of Soukhya Group of Herbal Products, right? The same. His wife died recently, right? Ashwini Trimurthi. She had come and met me... four days before she died. Hi. - Hi Amina. - Hello. - Ashwini. - I know. I asked you to come here because other places are not safe. My husband will come to know about it. All the tales she told me were really frightening. Dark stories of a drug trafficker who offloads tons of drugs... to the international market under the label of herbal products, using Soukhya Group's goodwill and credibility as a cover. Sitaram was my Father's General Manager. Still my father thought... he would make a great husband for me. My Father passed away two months ago. In every phase of my growth, he gave me just the right advice I needed. My guide and philosopher. When I lost him unexpectedly, it feels like a disturbing void. It's really a vacuum. I have nothing more to say. Thanks. Condolences. Thank you for coming. Gurukkal was travelling to Chennai, right? Yes. Accident. Seven kilometres after Salem... Head-on collision with a truck. Most unfortunate. - Strength to you. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. Accident... Right? Yes! Accident. Don't think otherwise. I don't want to lose you too. I love you. All the assets in my name, including my stakes in Soukhya Group... I want to transfer them to a trust. - Okay. - And... I want to move for divorce legally. - Okay. - Will you help me with that? Of course. This contains audited sheets of all my assets and my net worth. Okay. And another folder... contains details of all fiscal frauds done by Sitaram, that I know of. Okay. So, if you can initiate an enquiry, nothing like it. I'll see what I can do. Thank you, Amina. Pray for me. Take care. Four days after she met me, she died. Cerebral haemorrhage. I have strong doubts regarding her death. She was already dead, by the time she was brought to the hospital. The post mortem was done by the Forensic Surgeon at General Hospital. Can you please enquire? Just to reconfirm. I'm heading straight to Marayoor from here. How's Jeby now? He is okay. I have arranged a homeo doctor. His breathlessness has come down, now. - Convey my regards. - Okay. He thinks that all the money you're sending for him, is coming from me. That's okay. Let it be. Well, the files that Ashwini Madam sent me... I'll mail those to you, Sir. Please check them when you have the time. Did I keep you waiting for long, Sir? It's fine. I'm not in a hurry. I'm on leave, right? I know. I checked the report of the case you mentioned, once again. There's nothing suspicious about it. Classic case of cerebral haemorrhage. This Mrs. Ashwini Trimurthi... She had high blood pressure for the past three years. Maybe she took a break from regular medication. What is it, Sir? Any new developments in this case? Nothing, Doctor. Thank you for the information. Welcome, Sir. Well, Doctor... When Ashwini was admitted to the casualty that day, a duty doctor who was on duty there had identified... a cherry red colouration on her skin. Did you notice anything like that? No. I didn't see anything like that. In the house where the death happened, all the windows were closed, because it's a centrally air conditioned house. But at 6:10 a.m. that day, the windows of Ashwini's bedroom alone were opened. It's the testimony of a security guard over there. And at 6:20 a.m., the servants in the house, take Ashwini to the hospital. In this context, this cherry red colouration is significant. Carbon monoxide poisoning. After Ashwini's death was confirmed, the guy who went inside her room with necessary precautions... opens the windows. After that, Ashwini is taken to the hospital. I believe that you have observed the Pulmonary Edema and the necrosis in Globus Pallidus, Doctor. Sir? This is enough. You just panicked, right? Well, about the testimony of the security guard... I was just bluffing. I just described a scenario that could possibly have happened. And you endorsed it with your body language, Doctor. Thanks. Yes. Come on, move aside! Move aside! Move away! Since Advocate Amina's death has happened under mysterious and dubious circumstances, further details will be known only after the postmortem. Her friends and social workers are shocked... by the death of Amina who was also an activist. Marayoor Police found the body of Advocate Amina in a dreadful state. Sir. Mathews. I'm the Circle Inspector here in Marayoor. This is Sub Inspector Jayakumar. The postmortem has been completed. - I need to see the doctor. - Sir. Brutal would be too small a term to describe it, Sir. In my career spanning 27 years, I haven't seen such cruelty. This was done by a person with extraordinary strength. He used his bare hands to hurt her, to strangulate her. And then... heinous rape. In the genital area, he has used some blunt object to... Sorry, Sir. Sir, some of Advocate Amina's friends have arrived. And... there was a phone call from a relative. For taking the body... No one is ready to take the body, right? I'll take her. Sir. I know that you didn't like what I said regarding Binu Sudharshan. But you should promise me something. You should not violate the law's proper course of action, Sir. Okay? Boys, please serve. Excuse me, Sir. Mr. Christopher has come to meet you. Kindly excuse me. I'll be back. - Sudev, take care of them. - Sure, Sir. - Helga, come. - Sir. - Bring me my tab. - Okay, Sir. Pleasure meeting you. I was in a business gathering. Sorry to keep you waiting. It's alright. I didn't take a prior appointment either. The reason why I'm here is... Regarding Advocate Amina's death... you want to ask something to me, right? By the way, I'm so sorry for your loss. Please accept my condolences. Have a seat, please. - It's all right. - Excuse me, Sir. Sir. In fact, a few days ago... my wife Ashwini and... Amina had met each other. Both of them thought that wasn't aware of that meeting. But I was aware. Take a look. I have this really bad habit of spying on my wife. Four days after they met, your wife passed away. Strange. Ah! Yes. That cherry red colouration on her skin. Dr. Sajan told me... that you really unsettled him, Sir. I have told him that there's nothing to worry about. Yesterday, I immersed Ashwini's bones and ashes in Thirunavaya. Now all that remains is... her spirit, if at all there is a spirit. And... the file containing the financial transactions... which my wife handed over to Advocate Amina. I'm sure you've seen them. All those come under the limits of fiscal crimes. The ones who should investigate them... and take action... are the IT department, Enforcement Directorate, and so on and so forth. It means... mind your own business! As you very well know, for every murder, there will be a motive. Revenge, financial gain, sexual jealousy, etc, etc. Amina was murdered... after being raped. Rape has only one motive. And that's just rape! Brutal, violent sex. May her soul rest in peace. Now, if you'll excuse me... I've got guests over. My people will see you off. So that's the logic. The only motive for rape, is rape! So, someone is hired to rape her unto death. It's just a hypothesis, Sir. That's what I would say. You should be able to prove it legally, right Sir? Prove it legally? For what? Oh! That's a threat. Don't include me among helpless people... who got trapped in front of Christopher's gun. I am Trimurthi. What good is a Trimurthi in front of a gun? If the trigger is pulled, the bullet will pierce through! What's the testimony of the people who saw the body first? They are two locals, Madam. They do farming at the foothill. - Is it marijuana? - No, Sir. Cloves and cinnamon. Madam asked you, right? What's their testimony? They saw the body around 60 feet downhill. But the finding in our investigation is that... the molestation had happened at 40 feet downhill. Autopsy report says that it's a single assaulter. And he must be very familiar with the geography of this place, right? Yes, Madam. It was Christopher who took that girl's body with him, right? The funeral was also under his supervision. People say that she was like a daughter to him. - Kottarakkan! - Yes, Madam. Address him with a 'Sir'. He is our superior on leave. Okay. Christopher Sir! Madam, Christopher Sir has arrived. He is sitting outside. I'm coming. I was expecting you, Sir. My condolences. CM, Home secretary and DGP... know about the bonding between you and Amina, very well. They are really stressed about how you would react to this, Sir. That's why they assigned this case to me. Most of us would have had personal losses and unhealed wounds. But all those... are not the rationale to take the law into your own hands. I am at the final stage of the enquiry against you, Sir. And I guess I know you well enough now. That's why I'm telling you this. Please don't interfere in this case. There should not be a confrontation between us, Sir. If that happens, I'll be stern. And Sir, the person who did this to Amina... He will get the highest degree of punishment. I promise you that. That's left to you. I came to see you for something else, Sulekha. There's someone called Jeby whom Amina met through Facebook. He was the district topper in 10th and 12th grade. He is studying engineering now. He has a sister. Amina was supporting them financially. Every month... on the last Friday, she'd come here to see them. Just to spend the weekend. Someone who knew about this regular visit of Amina... might have done this. That might not be the case. Rape is often impulsive. That doesn't mean that I'm neglecting the possibility you mentioned. We've summoned that Jeby here. He is a chronic asthma patient. Be considerate. Didn't I tell you, Sir? Leave this to me. I am in charge. Okay. Sir, the police have taken Jeby away. He is a sick boy. I'm scared, Sir. Don't be scared, Seena. I've spoken to them. They will take his testimony and let him go. Let me know if there is anything, okay? She was your elder sister's age, right? What did you do to her? Move away! Jeby. Come. He has to take these medicines. Okay. Take complete rest. If your asthma increases, you have to come back immediately. - Thank you, Doctor. - Okay. Come. Seena. Are you sure that you're not going to file a complaint? Yes, Doctor. Chechi, Sir is here. Look what they have done to my brother, Sir. You said they will interrogate him and let him go, right? There is not even an inch on his body left to be beaten up! Let them beat me how much ever they want, Sir. But that officer said so many nasty things about Amina and me. I couldn't bear it. They didn't let him go, because you had asked them to. They did it because I fell on that policeman's feet and begged. At what time did Amina leave your house that day? That day, we left our house so that she could catch the 6 o'clock bus. She was really happy the previous night. We spoke so much, had food and went to bed really late. It's very cold today, right Itha? Didn't I tell you not to come with me? Your asthma might increase. You have exams next week, right? It doesn't matter, Itha. Well, it matters. You carry on. The bus stop is just at the end of that slope. No, Itha. Go on. - One black tea, Chetta. - Okay. - With sugar? - Yes. Are you planning to catch the St. Joseph bus, Sir? Yes. What brings you here, Sir? I came to see Micheal, the landlord. Okay. Only few people board the bus from here regularly, right? I'm the only one who boards from here regularly. I'm the cashier at Munnar Civil Supplies. The only other person is that Tamilian. Marimuthu. By the way, it's been two-three days since I saw him here. He must have entered the forest. He drinks the blood of wild chicken and wild boars. That's interesting. Is he from around here? He stays on top of that hill. He works at the farm of Varghese, the landlord. He is a peculiar character. The bus is coming. How much is it, Chetta? Ten Rupees, Sir. Here you go. Why didn't you board the bus, Sir? Sir. He was here till I reached this spot. He escaped through the back door. What evidence do you have to link this Tamilian with this crime, Sir? Troubling people unnecessarily! Marimuthu hasn't gone for work at the Munnar market... for the past 2-3 days. He has burned his clothes over there. - Go, search. - Yes, Ma'am. - George. - Yes. When you made the list of people with suspicious presence from this area, how come you missed this guy? You could have found him if you had investigated properly, right? But he's not a person with a criminal background, Madam. - Isn't it so? - Yes, Sir. There's no room for doubt if Kottarakkan says so. He has such a clean track record, right? But in this case, this Tamilian is the culprit. Sir, please don't... Hey! I want that man. Okay? Ma'am. I have sent a photo on WhatsApp. Please give me some backup. Cover all the entry points from Marayoor to Tamil Nadu. Okay? Please go fast, Bro. Hey, be calm. We will reach there exactly at 4 o'clock Everything is ready there for you to go to your home-town. But I should get my money. Okay? Hey! Don't you trust me? You'll get your money the moment I reach my home town. In that case, stay calm. - Hello, Sir. Greetings! - Greetings. Mari, give him that paper. This one? - How are you, Sir? - I'm fine. - See you, Sir. - Get going! - Shall we have food and then leave? - Okay, Bro. Come. Greetings, Bro. I'm taking a banana. Sit down. I'm starving! - Hey, eat and go! - Come! Where are you going? Hey, stop! Hey, come this way! Hit him! We can complete the formalities later, Madam. For now, transfer the accused. Okay. - George. - Yes, Ma'am. - You take him. - Okay. Well, he has the mainour. - A bag. - Okay. Are you okay, Sir? Thank you, Sir. Considering the skill and network of Kerala Police, you could have easily nabbed him. But that didn't happen. You were being misled. How did the most corrupted officer in our force end up in your team? It'll be good if you think about it. The bag Marimuthu had with him, had 10 lakh Rupees in it. He is paid. Don't end the investigation with Marimuthu. Thank you, Sir. You shouldn't be thanking me. It's Vadivukkarasi, the S.P. of this jurisdiction. She is an old friend of mine. She was very helpful. Call and thank her. Sure, Sir. I'll do that. Okay. Put in some more effort, everyone! We have to start the packing by 11:30 a.m. In the General Hospital, we have to start distributing Biriyani by 1:00 p.m. Stir this, Thoma. What is it, Sir? When we nabbed the culprit of a murder case from Marayoor, we found 10 lakh Rupees on him. In one of the cash bundles, there was a bank slip from a cooperative bank. When we traced the account, it was yours. Do you have anything to say? Dear Sir, I withdrew Rs. 10 Lakh from the cooperative bank... and went to Adimali for a real estate deal. I had kept the cash in the car. When I came back after having a tea, the bag full of cash was missing. I went to Adimali police station and filed a complaint immediately. I have the FIR copy, Sir. Please see this. The original document is inside the house, Sir. Just think about it, Sir. Had I paid the Tamilian and sent him away as soon as the job was over, I would've been trapped, if something like this came up. "Pathalam Suresh has not reformed even after attending the spiritual retreat. He is still taking up high level hitjobs." A rascal was saying this on TV, just last week. After finishing that girl, I had asked him... to come to Adimali to collect the money. I went to the station and filed an FIR before giving him the money. What if they check the tower location? That day, he was in Adimali. Me too! He hasn't confessed to the crime yet. And that chick is doing the interrogation herself. That's all fine. I have asked him to confess to the crime after two days. My biggest tension is that Christopher got involved in this. I was diverting her. Christopher got involved and the next second, he got caught! Sir... Christopher is a problem. That woman is also a problem. So, what I'm saying is that... you should play Christopher's game. What game? Encounter! Why are you honking so much? No one is going to move it hearing your honking! We should do it ourselves. What are you waiting for? Go and move it! Sir. Sir, I need to pee. Go and make him pee instead of sitting there! Should we waste more time for that? Hey! Remove his handcuff and hold his hand. Sir. Get out! Hey! Stop there! Welcome, Madam. I'm Vadivukkarasi, S.P. Yes. We spoke over the phone, right? Yes. Sir has told me everything. You know about that Velankanni operation, right? Yes. Back then, I was an Inspector. Madam, this is one of our black sites... for secret operations. No one knows anything about this place. Sir. What is this, Sir? How can you do this? Do you know what really happened to Amina, Sulekha? Tell her everything that you told me. Say it! The person who paid him Rs. 10 Lakh to commit this crime... was Pathalam Suresh, a notorious criminal. There's a nexus between Suresh and Kottarakkan. To topple your investigation, and to include Kottarakkan in the investigating team... A kingpin who's powerful enough to do that is part of this crime. Sitaram Trimurthi. Eliminating Amina was his necessity. I had asked you not to hurt Jeby when you summon him for interrogation, Sulekha. Sir, that... happened by mistake. Without my knowledge, Kottarakkan... Without your knowledge? Aren't you not ashamed of yourself? To send Jeby back home, do you know what Kottarakkan asked Jeby's sister Seena in exchange? I can't stand Kottarakkan's harassment, Sir. He didn't let go of Jeby for nothing, Sir. What can I do? He would have killed my brother if I had objected. He's not allowing me to live peacefully, Sir. He's threatening me, saying that he will arrest Jeby. To be with him again... I can't live like this, Sir. If something happens to me, at least you should know this. I'll give this video footage to you, Sulekha. What can you do to this subordinate officer of yours? If Seena's complaint becomes a case, police will grill her. Whatever she says, they will establish that she made up all those stories... so as to avenge her brother's arrest. In order to safeguard the morale and image of the police, the system will go to any extent. In the end, she will either become insane... or she will commit suicide. Kottarakkan, who'd be suspended from duty until then... will rejoin with a promotion. And that is how this bloody system is working! You can take him if you want, Sulekha. But... can you give me your word... that my Amina will get justice? Our system took eight years to hang the accused in Nirbhaya case. Everyone behind him... including the all powerful Sitaram Trimurthi... Will you be able to convict them? If the answer is 'Yes', you can take him, Sulekha. If not, leave him and them to me. Sir, as a committed police officer who believes in law, I must take him. But I am a woman too. A woman who can understand the pain Amina and Seena had to go through... A woman with many unhealed wounds within. I'm leaving him with you, Sir. Sir, they are all coming for the soft opening of our hotel tomorrow. All our guests are coming from Georgia. So, they're coming from Dubai or Georgia? Georgia, Sir. Alright. Once I'm back after the opening of our hotel in Kasaragod tomorrow, we'll settle the rest, okay? Gentlemen, we'll have to continue this later. Okay, Sir. Can you fix an appointment for the next Tuesday? It will be done, Sir. Sure shot! It was Christopher who shot me! If so, he would have shot Marimuthu. Or else, he will be in his custody. We have lot of limitations in that forest. After 1.5 kilometres, it's Tamil Nadu state. Hey, say something! In case Marimuthu is in Christopher's custody, it will be a problem. It will be a big problem. For whom? Marimuthu's direct and only contact... is Suresh. Suresh will leave to Dubai from Mangalore tomorrow, using another passport. And from there to Georgia. He will come back only after everything settles over here. The time from today until Suresh boards the flight tomorrow night... It's crucial. If Christopher nabs Suresh by then, it will out of our hands. If he nabs him, I'll show you what happens. If you shoot a rapist, you'll become a hero, Sir! A hero! The investigation will also end with it. What say? This is the video Suresh shared with me... on the very day you went to his house. He did it to convince me that his dealings are transparent. If Christopher gets this... That pig! I told Suresh that it's a risk to go to Mangalore... in his own vehicle along with his gang. I have asked him to come to our private dock tonight... to meet you. I have told him that you'll arrange for the transportation and security... to shift him safely from there to Mangalore. Latest Glock 17. 50 metres shooting range. What do you say? [Indistinct chatter] Thank you. This is the gun you gave Kottarakkan, to finish me off. I was loyal to you. You f♪♪♪♪d me over! Sir! Kottarakkan Sir! Shall we leave, Sir? It's an all-night drive, right? Tell me. I don't have patience, Kottarakkan. Who asked you to kill him? Tell me. Trimurthi. Suresh. You have two options. One. I will kill you, right here, right now. Two. You must finish off Trimurthi. I'll stand by you. After that, as per the plan... you can go to Dubai or Georgia. I don't have anything against you. It's him whom I want. What do you say? That pig who betrayed me... I'll put him to sleep myself, Sir. He finished off Kottarakkan himself. But you... I asked him to spare you for me! Hey! You hired this guy to kill one of our officers. DYSP George Kottarakkan. And now you're done with him also. So now you're setting me up. Gamble. It was a gamble. It was either you or Suresh. But like Christy said, it's you. Finally! North ADGP Gaurishankar. He's not part of your circle. A man of integrity. My batch-mate. So I'm taken. But an arrest is not... Christopher's style, right? No more gun toting? This is just a prelude. Let's go, Sir. Take him. You're right. This is the prelude. When you pray for rain, you better be ready for the flood too. [Lack of security. Trimurthi shifted to Poojappura central jail] [Pathalam Suresh murder case; culprit Sitaram Trimurthi remanded] [DySP George Kottarakkan's murder was a hit-job] [Suspicions regarding Ashwini Trimurthi's death. Crime branch has begun investigation] [Sridharan Gurukkal was killed in an accident] Sir... Sulekha Madam will submit the enquiry report on Christopher tomorrow. Should we proceed with what we discussed the other day? He will be released from here, in a couple of days. I'll let you know, Shaji. Let's see what the report says, first. My lawyer and auditor are coming tomorrow. Will take a call tomorrow. Sir. What did you say his name was? Manikantan. You just have to pay him the cash you promised. He will do it. Crap! What have you written in this so-called report? Is it Christopher's biography? Your sentimentalism is just disgusting! Shouldn't the life and career of a person like Christopher Sir... be referred in such an enquiry report, Ma'am? You should be understanding it more than anyone else, Madam. How dare you! How could you dare to take personal freedom with me like this? 2001 January 7th. A drug combing case that you and your father settled, using your money and influence. ADGP Abhilash Sir had told me about it. I haven't included it in this report. But... for your brother and his friends, some girls were brought to the hotel where that cocaine party was happening. Twelve girls who were devastated when they realised that they were duped. In the end, they even received your Dad's generosity. Rs. 10,000 for each one of them. Abhilash Sir doesn't remember the faces of any of those girls. Had he remembered, he would have recognized me! I'm not being sentimental about this. But there isn't a single day in my life... wherein I don't remember that night's sea and cries. I can understand Christopher Sir, somewhat. His wounds, his loneliness, his frustrations, his anger. Maybe he takes anti-depressants to get sleep, just like me. Being a partner, you should have understood him a bit more. You shouldn't have isolated him. Sorry for being personal. My report is final, Ma'am. Askar Sir and you can take any decision you want, Ma'am. Thank you. I'll handle it, Sir. Sure. Thank you, Sir. It was Abhilash Sir. Hi Sir. It's a new SIM. Askar. The report is in favour of Christopher. After the meeting with Sulekha, it's surprising that Beena Ma'am has endorsed the report. Moreover, our CM has a soft corner towards Christopher, right? So, Christopher is rejoining service, right? Absolutely. Without a doubt. So, his ex-wife's hatred towards him is also gone, huh? Lucky fellow! I want to see Christopher... tomorrow. Sir... that... You call him directly... and tell him that I want to see him. He will come. He likes a face-to-face. Okay, Sir. What else? Murthi Sir, shall I say something? It's not wise to assign a team of outsiders to deal with Christopher right now. We enquired about Manikantan whom Shaji Sir suggested. The one who is getting released from here. It's a perfect choice. So, Shaji... Assign it to him. At a place of his choice, to a person of his choice, my lawyer will hand over the money. Shaji, I need five minutes... I want to be with them alone. Okay, Sir. Carry on. Now listen to me carefully. I want to wreck Christopher before I finish him off. Sir. It's been 21 years since I had any kind of communication with you. 21 years, during which you and I have changed a lot. There's no point in thinking about what you were to me... or what I was to you before that. Time changes everything. Two days ago, Sulekha told me that... I could have been a better partner. It might be true. I used to think only about my losses. If I have considered the losses you faced as trivial, it might be from my feeling that I was there by your side. Thank you for coming. Shaji. You may leave. We need to talk. You may leave, Shaji. Sir, I'll be outside. He is scared... to leave you and me together here. No place is safer than the jail to meet you, Christopher. This... is the safest place to meet you. When you came to meet me after Amina's death, I realized, that you are really sentimental. Losing your loved ones will drive you insane. Your history says that. But I'm not sentimental like you. When you look into my eyes, what do you see? Nothing. No love. No compassion. You see nothing. Christopher, I will ruin you... sitting here, in this prison cell. You have no second chance. You asked me... what I see when I look into your eyes, right? Tell me. What do you see when you look into my eyes? Trimurthi, There's no creation or sustenance in my actions. Only destruction! I am the embodiment of destruction. It's useless to talk about the past, right? Nothing will be as it was before, right? But... when you feel really lonely, I'll be there to talk to you for some time, as a friend. Just a phone call away. And when I feel the same, I'll call you as well. I'm not saying anything more, Christy. Take care. Beena. Losing your loved ones will drive you insane. Your history says that. Christopher, I'll ruin you... sitting here, in this prison cell. You have no second chance. Hello? Hello! Christy? Where are you? I am at home. I'm stepping out now. Don't go anywhere until I reach there. What happened? - I'm on my way. - What's the matter? I'll tell you when I reach there. Hello? Hello... Christy? - Where is Beena? - She is upstairs, Sir. She wasn't opening the door when I called her. We are shocked by the death of Beena Chacko, the State Home Secretary. The police investigation has reported it to be a murder. The cause of death was the inhaling of dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide. The crime was committed by releasing the gas through the AC in her room. All the cameras in her house were disconnected. We might be able to find the culprits when we get more details... regarding the Wi-Fi device that was used for releasing the gas. Christopher was present there when Beena Chacko died, right? Is there anything dubious about it, CM? There is nothing dubious about it. Christopher will assume duty as Headquarters ADGP, very soon. There's a rumour that Sitaram Trimurthi who is in Central Jail... is involved in the death of the Home Secretary. I cannot reveal the details regarding the investigation here. Clear evidence regarding Home Secretary Beena Chacko's murder have been found. There are strong rumours about Sitaram Trimurthi's involvement in it. The money has been sent to the place he had mentioned. Christopher should not live, beyond tomorrow. Hey, Manikantan is over there, right? Ask him to come to D-Block. Safest place in the world. Christopher, you played it really well. Leave this to me, Sir. I must do at least this much for my Amina, right? Abhilash Sir will stand with us, come what may! So, Sitaram Trimurthi, who tried to murder the superintendent... was killed during the superintendent's attempt to defend himself. That's the official version, right? Yes, Sir. And that's the truth too. Have you heard this, Abhilash? Truth is just a construct. Truth is something that's made up. Sir. Here's the school transfer certificate and the medical report, Sir. Okay. I have arranged for the admission. She would need counselling for some time. That's also taken care of. Sir, are you making her stay in the hostel during her studies? No. At my home... with me!
