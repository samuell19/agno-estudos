"D." "N." "A." D.N.A. We would not be returning him to you in the form of a rather large pizza. It's just your Donald Duck. Donald Duck, indeed. It's been our luck tonight having you on the show. Ladies and gentlemen, Richard E. Grant. Thanks, mate. Well, what can I say about my last guest? They don't come bigger than this. This kid was an unknown on the Royal Command Performance, and I was honored to host it. Headlining that night was the great Tony Bennett, who sneaked in the wings to watch this boy perform. He said, "He's magnificent. Frank must hear about him." The Frank he meant, was, of course, Sinatra. And Tony, true to his words, took the lad back to Las Vegas... where America opened its arms to him. Sinatra went to see him perform, and said, "This is the prince who will wear my crown." It's a pleasure to have him home. Will you please welcome Toni Cocozza! Toni! Sorry, son. Sorry, boys, in you go. Tickets here, son. Sorry. No charge. Hoi. Fags. It's my last. See us a fag, doll.

Aye, that's right. Toni. Toni Cocozza. This is you as well. Aye, sure is. You're on the stage. Wow. That's fantastic. What do you do? What do you think? Are you a magician? No. Are you a funnyman? Do I look funny? Are you meant to? I'm a vocalist. I love all that! What's the name of your dummy? No way! You actually get up on stage and give it with the "doobey-doobey-do" stuff?

Do you wear a tuxedo? Couldn't step onstage without it. See, that's classy! I like a tuxedo. I've got pictures of my folks out with their friends. All the men are in tuxedos, and the women are all in their best gear. I've got pictures like that. They've gone to some big do, something special. They push the boat out. That's right. There's a pack of them. They look like movie stars. Well... Some of them. "B" movies. It's funny. There's always one couple that looks good, and there's always a couple with the woman with a slightly embarrassed face... because her husband... Pulls a big, stupid face. Yes! That'd be me. I've always wanted to have a night like that. I've spent a lifetime trying. Just do it. I don't care about that. Just fucking do it! - How you doin'? - Fine, thank you. Toni Cocozza. I know. What you having? I'm fine just now. Thanks. Come on in. Sit yourself down. You enjoy yourself the other night? Aye, I did. Thanks very much. Old Connolly's very taken with you. And Dainty. Very taken. That's nice. Sit down, sit down. You're not unlike him, you know. Who? Mr. Sinatra. You both be from the same kind of background... close to your family. Aye. My mother died when I was wee. My father, it'll be a year now. Hard. A great loss. First time I saw Frank Sinatra, he was wearing a gray suit. Single-breasted. High-waist trousers, four pleats. There was something about it I cannae describe. It was... It was like... It was like it was shiny, but not that shit shiny. It was like... It had a sheen. It had a sheen. - Could not see his face. He was wearin' a hat. - Aye, snap brim. Pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. Lit one, looked up. Then he said, "You want one?" His voice was cracked, cool. "Sure," I said. He handed me the snout, and looked straight at me. And he had the... clearest blue eyes I've ever seen. They were like the summer sky... reflected in a mountain stream. Crystal clear. And at that moment, I felt... like I was a guy in Ancient Rome. Because I was in the presence... of a god. What? No! He's hopeless, useless. I'm tellin' ya, I'm tellin' ya! Are you deaf? Got you a shot. Bourbon on the rocks. You know, I don't drink spirits. Will you no take a drink off me? Hmm? Come on, let me buy you a drink. Cheers. Cheers. Toni, will you do something for me? Stop trying to do it so fast. Easy, easy, easy. Wait, wait, wait. Right. Very simple. Don't poke about in them, okay? Don't let anybody else poke about in them, right? Or I'll let him poke about in you. Just keep them here until I tell you otherwise, and keep your mouth shut. Got it? Right, hen, on your way. Come on now, don't make any more trouble for yourself. - Leave me be! - Irene! I'm sacked. What? I'm sacked! They've given my job to somebody else. He can't do that. He's the manager. He can do what he wants. What's he done that for? Says I've jinxed the ciggies. Says sales have plummeted since I picked up the tray. I must have alcohol! He's got a whole pile of names for me. "Stick Insect," on account of my weight. "Snapper," due to the likelihood of my bones breaking. "Speck," due to my stature. That's disrespectful. Speck. This manager guy, he's way out of line. Well, he's got what he's always wanted now. A big glamour puss, all hair and gizambaas. I mean, you'll not even be able to see the tray now. I could do something, you know. There are people I could talk to. Pardon? I'm connected. That's all I'm gonna say. I know people. You know people? I do. You mean, like the people you were with in the casino? You know them, do you? And how do you think they treat me? Well, I don't really know them. You know, they just came to the show and... They invited me on. I just been there once. I went out of manners. They're not my pals or anything like that. I know! That was obvious. And by the way, if they were, I wouldn't be standing here with you now. I'm sorry. Got carried away. I hate to think of you being treated like that. Well, I appreciate the thought. Have another drink. Entrez. Shh. Let's get you some coffee. It's in there. Senor Cocozza! Can you can it? You'll wake me flatmates. I'm sorry, I was looking for the coffee. Make a pot. It'll keep you awake all night. It's for you! What? It's been a very bad day. Confirming my suspicion that all men are beneath contempt. However, among their number, you stand out, appearing to be a good sort whose biggest offense is an occasional lapse in taste, culminating in your hair being permed. For which you cannot be condemned. Now, I know that I'm drunk. But I sincerely believe that in order to end a disastrous day... on a positive note, I think we should get our kits off... and roll around like animals until our passions are spent. It wouldn't be right. What? Look, you've... You've had too much to drink, and you're not thinking straight. Sorry, that's the truth, you know. Let's not do something we'll regret in the morning. Irene? Oh, God, no. Irene? Ir... Irene. Oh, that is something! Sure, that's something! Aye, it's a keen letter, eh? Look. "We are looking forward to seeing you. Rod Edmunds, producer." The Big "T." It's no everyone will get a letter from the producer. Is it no just a standard letter? That's personal. It's just an audition. Eh? "We are delighted to offer you an audition. Thereafter, successful applicants will be invited to appear on the program." That'll be us! Okay, say you get on, doesn't mean that you'll win. Doesn't matter. What? I'll have been on TV. So? From that moment on, everything will change. I will become television's Toni Cocozza. Toni, son, you need to keep your feet on the ground. No, I don't. I'll tell you for why. Because things are going my way. What things? All sorts of things. Well, you'll see! My luck's changing. The gods are finally paying attention to wee Toni at last. And now they're smilin'.

It means, at least Neil Diamond isn't a baldy bastard like Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra was not bald. He was fuckin' toupee of the century, pal. You don't know what you're talkin' about! He was a baldy. He wisnae baldy! He was a rug merchant! Used to wear all cuts of Axminster tacked onto his napper. You're out of order, pal. You can still see it.

Plenty of ice. Something for yourself, bartender. - What're you havin'? - I'm all right at the moment. Shiny suit. It's no shiny, it's a sheen. You could light the street with it. Pardon me, Beau fuckin' Brummel. I came into a wee bit of cash. Wanna see something? Tickets for the show. They came today. The Big "T." What you make of that? Where were you last night? Irene phoned me. I know. She was very worried, and so was I. Well, I'm all right, so you can relax. I'm no daft, you know. I know you, and there's something no right here. So spit it out. Just leave it. Were you with them? Gonna leave it? - You were, weren't you? You were with them. - So what if I was? Christ, what is it? You a hard man now? A wise guy? Is that what you call it? You think I'm stupid? - You couldn't stand the pace of stupid. - Just drop it. Some wise guy you are. What were you doin' for them? Shining their shoes? A job, for your information. - What kind of job? - A fuckin' heist, man. A fuckin' heist! Stick that in your walking stick and walk with it. You're kidding. - You're just kidding, right? - Everybody knows the right thing to do when it's no them. You've seen them. You've seen the cut of 'em. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Jesus. Jesus Christ! Why? Why? Because they did me a favor. What favor? What do you think? Oh, dear God! Come on. It's a whiskey there. A large... A large whiskey. Is this where we are? Is this where we've got to? Nobody touched the guy. He just wised up, that's all. Same again for me. Not me. Don't do this to me. I'm out. Please! This talent show's our big break. Let's not blow this one. I want nothing to do with it. Nothing! And if you were wise, you'd pull out of it as well. Well then, Bill, walk away, you know? On you go. I don't think you're right, but I guess you're just displaying... your uncanny instinct for success, which has gotten you where you are today. What? Look at you. You're a clown. Same again. Irene? Irene? Irene? Irene. Ha-ha! Darlin', I've been waiting for you. You lied to me! What are you talking about? Do you mind? It's a private matter. You must think my head's buttoned up the back! No, darlin', it's a wee bit of kidology. I can't believe I was so stupid! No, please, please. I had to. Leave me alone! Please! What are we fightin' for? Come on. Life's too short. We should go have a meal. - We'll have a drink. We'll sort all this out, eh? - Look at the state of you! You look like a pimp! This? This is pizazz, that's all. I'm an entertainer. I'm one of the good guys. Do you understand? I'm one of the good guys. Get your hands off me! Get your hands off me! You can't handle it. None of you can fuckin' handle it. Wee Toni's... got a bit of success, wee Toni's gonna be on TV. And you're all eaten up with it. Go and take a long hard look at yourself, Toni. It's you should take a look at yourself! You and Bill and the rest of you! I've got one chance to make something of my life! And you cannae stomach that, yeah? Well, that's no friendship! There's fuckin' plenty of people will be happy for me, plenty of people will be pleased to see my name up in lights. You go on that program and you're gonna owe them for the rest of your life. That's up to me. Aye, so it is. I'm one of the good guys. I'm one of the good guys. I'm one of the good guys. Me. Toni. Good Toni. I'm one of the good guys. Mix to the wide. Cut and cue Jim. Will you give him a big, big "T" welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the swinging sound of Toni Cocozza! We're going all the way, folks. That's what we're here for. Keeps me young at heart, keeping you young at heart too. We're here every week. Tell your friends. That'll be my last. So you working the big night, Joe? The private function? Aye. All hands on deck for that one. You'll see something that night. You'll see some faces that've been taken apart... and they couldn't get back together right. And that's just the women. What's the big deal, then? It's Dainty's birthday. Who's Dainty? She's the wife of one of our more prominent local businessmen. Capisce? So best be on your toes or you could find them floating in your martinis. And he and her and all their colorful associates... will be carousing the night away in this fine establishment... absolutely free. Gratis. Furthermore, they will be treated to a night of entertainment... by some of show business's finest performers, and me as well. You're good. Come, come. Fifth. Is that good? I came fifth. Mind you, I did better there than elsewhere. Came last there, I think. No, placed... in the human race. And for what? I always thought it'd be more than this. That's my problem. I always think there's gonna be more than this. So I never saw... all... all the precious things. I didn't realize how, um, fragile they were till I'd broken them. One more for the road, eh? Chisholm wants you. - But what? - That's the day of Dainty's birthday. It'll take a half an hour, for fuck's sake. - Parties for Dainty. This is what's keeping her. - I don't like this drug stuff. What you like is of no fucking interest to anyone and their dog. Train gets in at 7:00. Pick up the gear and deliver it. Fuck it up, dead. Cheerio. Big John F. Did I tell you about him? Kennedy. You met Kennedy. Didn't exactly meet him. But our paths crossed, if you know what I mean. Irene. Don't do that, please, Irene. Please? You're totally right to turn your back on me, but will you let me do this one thing, please? I'll no ask you to forgive me because I've been unforgivable. I know that. But if you think you could give me another chance, will you let me know? Please. I think you're the greatest. I swear on my father's grave. You're the greatest. What're you doing here? Leave me alone. Get away from here. All the lot of you! Get away! We'll go where we fuckin' like. Beat it, eh? You hear me? Beat it. Think you're smart? Get away from here, eh? If I see your face around here, I'll kick it in for ya. - Leave him alone. Take your hands off him. - Shut your mouth. Right? Shut your mouth! I shows you, mate. I shows you, mate. I'll shows you... Behave yourself, son. You want a square go? Come on, I'll give you a square go. Hey! What's goin' on? Nothin', you know. Just nothin'. Beat it. You really strike terror in their hearts, don't you?

Um, report him to the social aid or report him to the social something. What are you talking about? Promise me you'll look after him for me. Aye, okay, okay. They're gonna kill me. Where's Irene?
