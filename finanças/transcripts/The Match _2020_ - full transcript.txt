Watch out, Nagy! Get back on defence, David! What's the matter? I'm terrible, Grandpa. Yes, you are. Thanks for the encouragement. Come. If playing football meant doing everything by yourself you would be the best. Sure, you want to score the winning goal and be the big hero. Everybody wants to do that for himself. But you cannot be the hero every time you're playing football. Maybe you should play tennis. No! I love football. Of course you do. It's a love that never ends. A love you cannot betray. When did you know? How much I loved football? Well, I must have been a few years younger than you. My father took me to see a match. He didn't tell me where we were going. It was supposed to be a surprise. And what a surprise. I'll never forget going up the steep stairs and all of a sudden, I see in front of me this endless, bright green field. I swear, I've never seen such a bright green in my life. At my age, I forget too many things. Too many to remember. But I'll never forget that day... and the way the field looked... the way the field smelled. Some memories stay with you. They never fade. They are too important. Was it different? Everything was different. How many footballs do you have at home now? Ten, I think. Ten. I had only two. And they were two more than all my other friends. Your great grandfather owned a nice restaurant where all the local players came and celebrated. So, as gifts, sometimes they give him footballs. I begged my father day and night to let me go outside and play with the ball. No way. Not a chance. They were too rare and precious. Owning a ball meant to be privileged and my father didn't want the other boys getting jealous of me. I know I wanted to do everything by myself but that's because I thought I could. Sacrifice, David. A team can only win when you set aside your ego and work for everybody. Football is the only sport where a team that has no chance of winning can surprise the world. If only they do what? Play as a team. Exactly right. We were better today. Yes, you were, but you lost. The best team doesn't always win. And I should know. Know what, Grandpa? There's a story I never told anybody. Not even your father knows. Does it have to do with football? Yes, it does. That's why I want you to hear it. It's time. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Branko. Yes, sir. Do you know who this is? Yes, sir. That's Laszlo Horvath and the team that beat the Nazis... Shh! Yes, yes. That's right. Now, your only duty today is to make sure that their glasses are never empty. Yes, sir. Here. Just go. Compliments of the ma√Ætre d', Mr Horvath. Aren't you too young to be serving alcohol? Yes, sir. But I'm only serving it, not drinking it. Soon enough, you will know why it makes everything and everyone much more fun. Don't believe anything he's trying to tell you. Either he is lying or trying to corrupt you. I just told the kid he's too young to be serving alcohol. Well, in a minute, he'll be offering you a drink. So scram, kid, if you wanna save yourself. - I will, sir. - No, no, no. Wait a second. Come, come closer. Um... I'm s... Come, come. For you. - I'm sorry, Mr Horvath. - Laszlo. Mr Laszlo, I don't think my father will approve. You know... You deserve it... - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers! Happy New Year! I see what I like. Wish me luck. I will, as always. I'm Laszlo Horvath. Nice to meet you. You never were the shy one. A man can never have enough of two things in life. With you, of all people I always thought limiting yourself to just two things is a sin. Besides... the beautiful sight in this place has clearly taken a fancy to you. On the contrary, the opposite side seems to be paying an even closer attention to your every move. I thought I told my mother not to come here. The Nazis... You have their undivided attention. Well done. So what? I care enough to stare right back. Are you deliberately trying to provoke them? You know what happens to them who stare at the devil? Even this devil is nothing but flesh and bone. They don't think they are. Well, that's their Achilles heel, not mine. Yours is vanity. Just be careful. There's a lot of them in here and out there. Please. I'm begging you. Do me a favour. Stop it. Please. You're a famous man, Mr... Laszlo. That's the name. Laszlo Horvath. We all had a bet if you were indeed the famous player everyone remembers. Did you win the bet? - Yes, indeed. - Good. Because just a few years ago you guys didn't fare so well. Please... do not remind me. You and your men were fortunate enough to beat the Nazi team three to two. But this was seven long years ago. We are much better now. I can see. Soon enough, all of Europe will be Nazis so you can play against yourself, which is great. That way you can prevent yourself from ever losing again. May I suggest a small wager? My fellow men and I have a proposition for you. Considering you were a part of a team that beat the Nazis... we would like an opportunity to get back a little bit of... how would you say... pride. Whoever manages to bounce the ball in the air between two people the longest without it falling to the ground, wins. Loser pays the winner food, drinks, anything for the entire evening. I insist, Mr Laszlo. You know what? I'm a little bit confused. I thought pride is what you were waging? Very well. You win, and we will pay whatever you and your men wish to consume and if we win, pride is what we will take. Pride is not won. It is earned. And besides, that's not too much of a wager since everything at our table, as you can see is already on the house. Maybe you have another suggestion, then? As a matter of fact, I do. You... your fellow men, your army... all of you... leave Budapest tonight. And never come back, ever again. Mr Laszlo even if you were to win I am not sure you would want this to happen. It was worth a shot. I insist. If I could have your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. The famous Laszlo Horvath and I have come to terms on a bit of a fun wager. The only thing we need to complete this wager... is a ball. Does anyone here know where to find one? I can't even remember what made me raise my hand. I was so scared. If I hadn't raised my hand and gone down to the basement that New Year's Eve things would have been different. Much different. But my God... they must have bounced that ball between them a good five minutes. I was amazed. Everybody was amazed. Congratulations, Mr Laszlo. Fortunate, as you were in '36. Fortune takes a back seat when you have those two men. Gentlemen, please. After me, probably the best two players your eyes will ever see. And let me tell you a little secret. Even when drunk they're still better than any men you put against them. Cheers. Another toast. - Already? - One more drink. I insist, Mr Laszlo. To the Third Reich. To empires. From Romans in 476 right down to the Ottomans in 1924. You do know your history, Mr Laszlo. You know what all those empires have in common? Please tell me. Our history. The history we are about to make will be written by the winners living in our times. - Come on, let's go. - I hear it's pretty cold up there in Russia. I suggest you pack warmly. Gentlemen, I think we should better call it a night. Hurry. You were a great football player. Nobody knows that better than me. Things have changed. Accept it. Branko! Branko! But, sir! That man! He is hurt! Did you ever see him again? Mr Laszlo? Yes. Not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. He was and still is the reason why I'm here, telling you this story. Mr Laszlo. I haven't said his name like that since then. Horvath! If you're not outside in less than ten seconds they will drag you out by force. This is not the time or place to be defiant. Come outside. Immediately. That would not be a wise move. You have five seconds to line up with the rest of your friends here. Five... four... three... two... and... one. You here are the privileged ones but never forget that you are all expendable. It's up to each and every one of you to decide your fate. Now, get to work. Give me a hand. I recognise you now. You won't remember me, but I remember you. Played against you in '42 when I was a member of the regional team. Name's Karolyi. Karolyi Faraco. I was a defensive midfielder. You scored four goals in that game. The scoring drive you made in the second half I can't remember seeing anyone do that since. You were an artist out there. Combination of artist and a magician. The flair of Michelangelo and the nerves of steel of Houdini. Our Hungary, it stopped being a country a while ago. Even the government is just a puppet of the Nazis. So now they're arresting anyone they consider a threat. Intellectuals. Undesirables. Supposed "dissidents" like me. For whatever reason, now you. Work us hard every day till even our souls begin to feel tired. Why are you complaining? Aren't we the "privileged ones"? At least we're still alive. Alive enough to be worked to death. Speak for yourself. But don't drag others into that abyss with you. We've heard stories, what happens to other camps. So even if we are being worked to death I'd take it any day over dying in a gas chamber. Who knows what makes a man like that tick? You ever see him play, Jakob? See? I was in the stands when he scored the goal that beat the Nazis. Such a great player on the field. Good at sports, bad at life. I'd rather be good at life than a world champion in any sport. Ah. Tibor. Any news? I heard a rumour that the Nazis are losing ground in the East. The whispers might be true. My father always taught me that a beast is most dangerous when it is hurt. And your father, is he safe? They separated us. My wife, son, mother, father, sister. We had a nice bakery, you know. Best one in town. When it all began, it came so quickly. All the people that used to come to our shop they no longer wanted to help us. When you need help the most, they disappoint. It's the law of survival. No! It's the law of selfishness, of not caring. Do you think that he cares? From the looks of it, I think he stopped caring a long time ago. My first days here were unbearable. Time stretched on where I didn't know what day or month it was. You know, you think you'll spend this life learning reading, loving. And now, every moment here is spent just surviving for the sake of survival. And you ask yourself, "What am I surviving for?" What will be left out there of the world if this madness ever ends? Even when I was overseeing construction in Gyor I never worked crews this hard. They want us to die. Hands of a baker. Should be covered in sugar and flour not hard, ugly blisters. Good baker must be able to sense the dough with his fingers. His name is Tomasz. That's about all we know. Not even the other gypsies know anything about him. He doesn't speak. The Nazis, just for spite give him more food than to the rest of us. I think it's because they want to keep us on edge. I am Yanko. You really think they will have any use for the things we're building for them? Of course. One thing they're not is stupid. All things being considered, we here, we are the lucky ones. Some are being sent to the battlefield near the front. We heard stories that they use them to clear the minefields by making them march across. I know why we are here. Why would a famous Hungarian like you be sent to this miserable place? ...and Colonel Franz Woerns, the Nazi Regional Commander of all of the camps, has honoured us by making our camp his headquarters. For your information, Colonel Woerns reports directly to General Ziege the Nazi commandant of the entire region. Carry on. - What is the count? - Twenty nine, sir. - How many? - Twenty nine, sir. Bring that fool outside. Now. Now! May God help him. Everyone manages to follow the rules. Yet you choose to be the only one to put all the other men here at risk by being disobedient. Isn't it bad enough your behaviour is the reason Andreas is in the hospital? Huh? Stand up! This instant! Henkel. Enough, already. Are you not aware who this man is you are beating? This is Horvath the Great. Greatest Hungarian to ever play the game of football. It's good to see you again, Laszlo. I still remember that free kick. The one that won the gold medal game against us. That was right after I fouled you at midfield, remember? I only remember that Nazis lost. You and I must talk. Bring him to my office. But Colonel, I do not think this is a very good idea. Even if he is a famous football player. It doesn't mean that he has the right to defy our authority time and time again. I will see this man in my office. Laszlo was too crazy to live an ordinary life. He would play life the way he would play football. Fast, relentless, unafraid. He would fight anybody at any time without thinking twice. If he saw a tornado coming he would go straight for it and shout "Give me your best shot". Some people live just to get by but not Laszlo. He lived his way for as long as life would let him. If life was a game of football Laszlo would play each of the ninety minutes as if they were his first and last. You always were different, Horvath. Everyone stared at you when you played afraid to miss the next great move you were about to make. I have to admit to you that we, as the Nazis were always quite jealous. But let's not share that with anyone. Lt Henkel would have surely killed you out there today if I did not intervene. You can pound your chest like a gorilla in a jungle but even you might tremble if suddenly the barrel of a gun was pointed to your face. You guys wouldn't do that. You are certain? Yes, you would shoot me in the temple. So that I couldn't see what was coming. The element of surprise, of course. To you, maybe it is surprise. To me, it's a... desperate move of a coward. Always you were such a funny one. Now... seeing you today has given me an extraordinary idea. So, in less than two months, it is the F√ºhrer's birthday. April 20th, to be exact. I would like to arrange a game. A football match between you and the men at the camp against the Nazi team. To commemorate such a momentous occasion. You can't be serious. I am not like you Laszlo, I don't make jokes. This is an opportunity for all of us. Us? - Who are "we"? - You, me, the men at the camp. The men in this camp are barely given anything to eat. They're in no condition to play. This is a chance. A real chance to play a game that you love and at which you are truly one of the best. You will be a winner just by playing, Laszlo. You could think of it as a friendly exhibition match. You would display your skills. A tribute to the beautiful game... and something special for the men at the camp. In a way, something special for me too. It does remind me of an old saying... "Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing." Laszlo... I am speaking as someone who wants to help you. A wolf can spare a sheep if his appetite has been satisfied. I've been under the assumption that an endless appetite for everything anything, anyone... was the trademark of the Third Reich. I'm serious about this. It's not just up to me. You're asking for a lot. Of course, I am. But I am also offering you something few are given. I would have to inform General Ziege, of course. He loves football. I am sure with my blessing, he would approve. Oh, there's one, uh... last tiny detail. Your feet may have made you a hero to your fellow countrymen but your mouth will get you killed. Next time, fortune might not be on your side as me saving you from yourself this morning. I would not count on that good fortune if you were to say "no" to me. And my suggestion is... to take my offer as a gift. That will be all. We had an interesting talk. Talk? Nazis don't talk. They take. They order. They kill. The one thing about the Nazis is that their memory of a loss never fades. So that's all you talked about? How you beat them once? No, not entirely. He wants us to play. A game. A game? What kind of game? A match. Football match. Against whom? Against Nazi team. On Hitler's birthday. Is this some kind of cruel joke? Franz was serious. So am I. But how could we play a football match? If we all tried running for five minutes we'd faint, and this isn't five. He's right. We don't have the strength or stamina. Maybe this is our one chance. Don't forget, every chance of failure also presents a chance to succeed. However, any inaction resulting from fear guarantees failure. If all of you think we should play then that is what we'll do. No team can win unless there's team unity. Now, who wants to play? Conditions must be met. We'd need better food. Time to train, build a real team. Very good. Then you and I will ask for these conditions. "You and I", what do you mean "You and I"? Since you and Andreas were former members of the regional team and Andreas is unavailable that makes you the co-captain. Welcome aboard. ...twenty six... twenty seven... twenty eight... twenty nine... thirty. So good to see you, Mr Horvath. Very punctual. As I understand Colonel Franz is expecting you this morning. Please understand that I don't give a damn about who you are or what you used to be. Karolyi, let's go. "Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, Prelude" by J. S. Bach Come in. Ah, Laszlo. So good to see you again. Welcome. So, who is this? This is Karolyi Faraco. He represents men in this camp. Please, sit. So gentlemen, I have excellent news. General Ziege is very excited about the idea of a match. And in fact, he has asked to personally be given progress reports. We are also very excited, but... this does depend on certain things we would require. Such as? Food. Real food. Larger portions for every man in this camp. Go on. The team itself. I need to search other nearby camps. I doubt you'll find anyone. If you're allowed to pick whoever you want in all of the Third Reich then I should be allowed to pick the best available players from nearby camps. Hmm. What else? We cannot train and work at the same time. I hope you understand that. In order for us to look like a team we have to train like one so until the match is played we don't work. We train. Is that all? Karolyi? One hour every three weeks to write letters to our loved ones. And mail delivery to us twice a week. I must regrettably inform you that all your requests cannot be granted. The food situation can be improved, perhaps. I'll consider the mail issue. But you still are prisoners inside this labour camp and by definition, you will work and come up with a team from the men you have here. - Is that definite? - Absolutely. Then please inform General Ziege we cannot play this match. Karolyi, let's go. You just walked out on a Nazi colonel. - Halt! - Trust me. I know the Nazis. He wants to play a game before the real game? So be it. Is that game called who gets shot first? If it is, please don't put me in. Halt! The colonel ordered both of you to halt! He's playing a game. He's playing a game. Gentlemen... our talk wasn't quite over. Please see to it that you follow me inside. Go! Now! Please tell me that you knew he was going to miss. Let us have a mutually-satisfying conclusion to our meeting. Yes? I have reconsidered your requests and I am willing to increase the quality and double the food portions. When it comes to work the men will work in the mornings and train in the afternoons. The letters. We insist. Yes. The prisoners will have enough time to write and receive mail. - You may visit three camps... - Five. Four. I will pick the very best fifteen players. A match is played with 11 men on the field the last time I counted. I'm being generous when I request 15 as these men can barely walk, let alone run. I must have reserves. What if someone gets injured, like Andreas? This is quite enough. Thirteen players, not counting Andreas. I will see to it that what we agreed today is put in writing. But remember... you, and you alone, are responsible if anything goes wrong with any man on the team you choose. The match is exactly 36 days away. This will give you plenty of time to prepare. Oh, Laszlo. One last thing. Good luck. How did you know? The moment he said General Ziege was excited I knew he could not back down. It's Hitler's birthday and if everything goes nice and easy for him then he gets promoted. Let's go find our team. I can only pick an additional 11 men for the team. Whoever plays will get shorter workdays but training will be intense. I need you to be completely honest. Who here can play football? Be honest. Alright. Jakob. Good. I'm impressed. Tibor, you're next. There's hopelessness all around us but here, tonight, there is hope for Hungary. Tomorrow, we will find the rest of our team. And we'll start to work right away. They didn't look like a team just yet. Who could? Conditions were terrible. Nobody was thinking about football. Football was a means of survival. Word spread to other camps that whoever was lucky enough to be chosen they would be sent to a camp with better conditions. Everyone! Who here can play football? Naturally everybody became a football player. Some of them were quite good. Some others... well, they did their best. Come on, Laszlo, let's go. You know what happens to them who stare at the devil? Even this devil is nothing but flesh and bone. They don't think they are. Who's that man over there? The prisoner's teaching the violin to the camp commander. Can you invite that prisoner to come over? I do not think this will be possible. One does not interrupt the commander's lesson. Then please inform the commander that interruption of his lesson comes at the request of General Ziege. Laszlo, this is it. It's the last camp. We only have one slot left to fill. What are you doing? We need players! Good ones. Why are you wasting our final choice on a man who's... playing the violin? Go, get a ball. Did you request to see this prisoner? That would be correct, Commander. - May I ask why? - We need him. For what? To play the violin? No, to play football. Hmm. Violin players don't play football, do they? Look. Put down the case. Yes. We have a goalkeeper. Great reflexes. Give it back. Do you... Do you play football? That's what I thought. Then again, if you don't play that would enable our beloved Third Reich to win. Yes, take him, by all means. But go. Can someone tell me what this is all about? I'm Laszlo. This is Karolyi. Welcome to our team. A man entering a camp holding a football meant there was hope. And Laszlo became this hope for everyone who saw him. Including me. And I was the last one who expected it. What did I tell you, Branko? I said "Never let them leave". What do I do now? I'm so sorry, sir. It will never happen again. But who will get them back? - I will. - How? Come on. I don't know what it was. Call it destiny, chance, fate, a roll of dice. I've thought about it countless times. Why was he there, in that exact moment? Go into the truck, wait for me. A few seconds later and he wouldn't have seen me. You always defy me. It's unacceptable. Where have they gone? What? Don't look at me like I'm stupid. Like I'm some kind of scum. You're the scum! Let's go. We have what you wanted. Piece of shit! You stupid little... Get up! Get up! That's not our fight. You can't save everyone. Let's go, Laszlo. Excuse me, Commander. You were told to leave. - You have your men. Now, go. - Yes, but this boy. What about the boy? He's state property. What's that to you? General Ziege and Colonel Woerns do outrank you. Am I right? So in a way, if I'm here with their authority I outrank you. You think that's gonna keep me from shooting you? Of course not. No, no. But your logic does. If you were to shoot me you would have to explain it to the general and to the commander why their personal birthday present to F√ºhrer is no longer possible. Think about it, it's no good for anybody. Get out. Get out. Wow, Grandpa you must have been very good if he picked you. I wasn't. And anyway, I was too young for him to pick me even if I was as good as you are now. So why did he pick you? Grandpa? I was a boy who never saw himself becoming a man. So we have a violin-playing goalie and a kid as our substitute. Good work, coach. There is more to this game than pure skill. Kid is number fourteen. The colonel will never let you keep him. We'll see. Tell them to come down. Prisoners, come here. Now! Congratulations. You seem to have assembled a formidable team. But correct me if I'm wrong, I count 13 men and one child. Are you trying to adjust the rules by sneaking an extra person onto the field due to his small stature? - No, I... Yes... - Thirteen. You will keep to what was agreed upon. Henkel, take the child. No, no. Wait. Wait. Wait! Who do you think will clean up after us? Get the ball when it goes out of bounds? Supply us with water? One thing about kids is that they have lots of energy. You think of me as a fool? No. It is always something with you Laszlo. But fine. You will have an extra pair of feet to run for you. You want this? - Yes. - That means you'll have more energy to spare. So... for the next two days You and your team will get a vacation... from all food. You can, of course, change your mind right now if you want. No. Good. He never should have picked me. It didn't make any sense. I was just some boy he once saw and remembered. A little boy had no place among men whose children were lost, or in other camps. Yet... he stood by my side. Can't sleep? No. Everyone is angry at me. Not having food for few days will do that to people. But don't worry, they'll get over it. You know, I... I did many mistakes in my life but this time, I did the right thing. Go to sleep now. You'll need it for tomorrow. I will, Mr Laszlo. Thank you. In the days leading up to our glorious match you may think you are special... but you are nothing of the sort. Any and all preferential treatment you might get accustomed to... don't. You are all still prisoners and will be treated as such. Anyone not fulfilling his work assignment will be punished with swift action. Anyone attempting to escape will be shot. And this includes also... the youngest team member. I hope not one of you gets injured. I'd hate to see Laszlo play a game with ten men and this little boy. When the final whistle blows everyone will go back to what he was doing before. Including watching over geese. Would I be correct? The Commandant is anxiously awaiting your return and so are all the geese you let loose. One little boy will have to catch every single one of them. Don't let him get to you, kid. I won't. But it's OK to feel scared. But you have 13 backs to watch over you. Am I right, Karolyi? Aye, captain, my captain. Are we angry about the food? Are we angry about Andreas? Yes. You should be angry. I'm furious. So we have to use it. Every time you see Nazi come charging down the field remember how hungry remember how angry you were in this moment. Anger wasted on the wrong address is anger that lingers on. So send it the way of the Nazis and you won't waste a single breath. Are we angry? Yes! Are we angry? Yes! Good morning, gentlemen. General Ziege. Welcome. How is team Laszlo looking today? I don't see them posing a threat to our team. I predict a comfortable victory. - The F√ºhrer deserves it. - Who is the man with the ball? That is Sandor Stekely a regional player from Bakh√°za. I would say behind Laszlo Horvath and Karolyi Faraco he is likely their third best player. Laszlo discovered him at another camp. He's a real find. Sandor Stekely of Bakh√°za? Any relation to Magda Stekely, the famous opera singer? Yes, I believe that is his wife. How interesting. How's your family? Do you know where they are? No, sir. I don't. My father helped a Jewish lady. Our families were friends. She helped in the kitchen and one of the waiters told the Nazis to save himself... and that's it. They separated us immediately... burned down the restaurant... and there was nothing left. I was angry and furious because I didn't think I deserved to be saved. There's a guilt you carry inside... because you're the only one who survives. Why me? Why not them? Why not all of us? So what about you, Laszlo? Kids? Wife? I took my time to pick the right girl. And? And... there were too many to pick from so I couldn't make up my mind. I don't know, I just... I kept waiting and waiting, and... then the war begins... and suddenly no one cares that much about falling in love. I think you love football so much that no one else not even a woman, stood a chance. That could be true. Football always was my first love. and whenever I did love someone else football became kind of my... mistress. They would all wonder where I was what was I doing, thinking I was unfaithful. But no, every chance I had, I was... I was on that field. I was there. The scent of freshly cut grass... the moment when you slide on your cleats... and the moment when that football gently touches your foot... it's a love affair of epic proportions. You play... for, and out of, love... and on a very good day when game loves you back and you taste the victory, despite the odds... that's the day to live for. Yeah. Two more weeks. Then we find out if David can topple Goliath. We're not David. We're an ant under David's foot. Good. If they think of us as an ant ...we can win. Sandor Stekely, correct? Correct, sir. The colonel would like to see you in his office. Now. What a voice your wife has. It seems my superior, General Ziege is a great admirer of her. He is not a man who is easily impressed. What does my wife have... At his invitation your wife will tonight be giving a performance at the concert house in Karlovac. And your wife has asked the general if he could see to it that this letter be personally delivered to you. I have, of course prepared your release authorisation. Thank you. Sandor! Sandor. Alright? Come on! Go, go. OK? Let's go! Sandor! I think you should talk to him. Sandor. Join us. You alright? Yes. My wife... I think she wants to help me. Help you? How? I received a letter today. There is a way for us to be together again. No, no, don't fall for their trick. They're trying to sell you a story. What if it's true? I know her handwriting. It was her. Karolyi, give me your letter. Give me your letter. It's been glued back. Never underestimate the Nazis. Yes, but this is different. We were offered a deal. Don't you see what they are doing? Sandor, it's your wife. Fine. San... Do you think it's true? - About their offer? - Doesn't matter what I think. The game hasn't even started and they're already ahead. I changed my mind. I can't go through with the offer. Please, I must speak with the colonel. I do not know what you are talking about. Please, I'm begging you. I can't have my wife go through that. Back to work, prisoner Stekely. Please, Henkel. Please. Sandor, stop! Hey! Sandor! Tomasz, I must see my wife tonight. Please, I know what I'm doing. I will be back in the morning. Halt! Halt! Brava! Brava! Brava! Was I not clear that if someone tried to escape they'd be met with severe penalty? You and Ziege did this. No! You did this to yourself! You picked these men! You wanted to see other camps! Sandor was your choice! He was a weak man who made a stupid and fatal error! - I have to find somebody else... - No! - He was one of our best players! - You have 11 men and, of course, your violin player and the little boy. And If someone gets injured, you play with ten men! I do not care! You will inform your team that all of your privileges have been taken back. You'll receive limited food and there will be no more mail delivered until the match is played. This is not what we agreed to. Your teammate broke the promise you made to me. We are done here. Good day. Henkel. You can't be serious about me playing? I wasn't before. But now I have no choice, you gotta be ready. But can't you kick a ball at all? Well, yes. If you have to play, you'll play defence. This is insane. We are days away and you have to teach him how to kick a ball? We wouldn't be in this situation if you didn't pick a violin player with two left feet and a little boy. How could I deny this boy his chance of growing up and getting old? So, um... what's the plan? We all bunker down in our goal and we wait, for our chance. Sounds about right. Anytime you have an opponent who is clearly better than you you can't go at them, guns blazing. So we let them shoot their way out of ammo and then we wait for a crack in their armour. The moment that whistle blows, they're coming at us. Patience is not something they're known for and they won't be practising it against us because they expect us to lose, and lose badly. The longer we manage to hold them back the more nervous they will get. And when certainty is replaced by panic... ...we strike. Yes! If all we do is defend how do we score? What have we been training for? To defend, apparently. Our chance will come from a counterattack. When they lose a possession, which they will I'll make sure I get the ball to one of you. So that's the plan? We wait for them to lose the possession? If they ever lose one. You alright? Yeah. Aron, when in doubt, what do you do? I kick the ball as hard as I can. Good man. There is so much you are capable of doing. We have a baker we have a florist, we have a bookstore owner we have a man who still hasn't spoken a word. We have fathers and sons and we have pride and dignity and we have so much more. If we are going to rain on their F√ºhrer's birthday parade it's not going to be with what I can do. It's going to be with what each of you can do. Somehow, we were coming together as a team. They tried to break us, but it didn't work. Whatever they did, we ended up feeling close. And as for Laszlo, as things got worse the more it fired up his anger. And he pushed and pushed everyone to the edge. We'd watch him run and run, and if he was ever tired he would barely show it. If he didn't stop, no one dared to stop either. Each of us had a hunger that was different than just a lack of food. At all times, what do we do? Stay together! I'll yell "Franz". The code is "Franz". When you hear that, run up front. - Alright? - Yeah. Tomorrow, well, I don't have to tell you what is tomorrow. So get some rest and don't think about the game until the match begins. At all times, what do we do? Stay together! You think he knows what he's doing? He should know. He's played the game all his life. Do you think we have a chance? To do what, win? Of course. I just wanna survive another day. Laszlo said not to think about football any more. So don't. Goodnight. Goodnight. Why did you save me? You ever like a girl so much... that you can feel your heart beating right up here near your throat? No. You ever kiss a girl? No. There is your answer. Without love and a kiss, life is nothing but a big old book filled with pages that have nothing to say. There was this one girl. I always walked past her house on my way home. Did you smile? Every time you saw her? Yes. Did she? Sometimes. That's nice, isn't it? Yes, it is. You'll find out, one day, what it's like... when that "nice" turns into extraordinary. Good night, Mr Laszlo. Good night, Mr Branko. Andreas, what are you doing here? The hospital released me yesterday and ordered me to report back to camp. How do you feel? I am ready to help our team win the match. Too bad you can't play. All the positions have been filled. You gave me your word. Andreas is not included in the final count. We have written agreement. Yes, he can board the truck. You never played this before. It's beautiful. - What is it? - It's called "Kol Nidrei." It's played in many synagogues on Yom Kippur Eve the holiest of Jewish holidays. That's what you played the day I met you. Laszlo, you have a good memory. No... don't tell me you were teaching a Nazi officer how to play a Jewish melody? It was worth the risk. Come on, keep on playing. We all need it. It was the first time in ages we had all seen something clean and fresh. Soap! Something that smelled new. Soaps! Real soap! I think that was the only time I saw them behaving my age. Branko. Branko. So clean, so nice. Ooh! Nine. Wow! Little things become big quick if what you take for granted is taken away from you. Aron... is going to play the part of our coach. You just stand on the... I hope I'm not intruding, gentlemen. You like the uniforms? Please, please, have a seat. I believe you are also enjoying the towels and the soap. One must always have fresh towels on a big match day. Nee? Now, if you'd excuse me, Colonel I'm about to enlighten these men with my super-secret strategy that I wouldn't like you to hear unless you are here to spy on me? No need for that. We want a just and fair battle on the field. And the men in this room represent fairness and justice. Certainly. I will leave you with your team. Oh, one more thing. You will not need to wear your armbands today. No need to mix politics and sport on such a great occasion. What a fine idea, Colonel. This match does indeed have nothing to do with politics. We are all here to have a great time. Yes. Best of luck. Come closer. My team. Let's just play together and show these Nazis that football is not a game in which they always win. Because what I see in front of me it's not just a group of men. I see a team. A team that can beat anyone! Let's go now! Let's show them what it feels like to bleed. Yeah. To victory! Today and always! To victory! For years, I couldn't go to see a game. The sounds I heard that day wouldn't stop. The hate they had for us... it was constant. Like a scream that kept coming... coming and coming. It still echoes. Grandpa, was anyone rooting for you? To make the show complete, a few were allowed in. We could see them, but we could not hear them well. It was the only moment our people could rise up even the slightest, against the enemy. General Ziege, welcome. You've put together quite the event, Woerns. - Thank you, sir. - Impressive. Very impressive, very impressive. Very good. Thank you. Were you scared? No. Not on that day. I had been scared and close to death many times before. But on that spring afternoon, being scared was not an option. We wanted victory. For us. And for those who were not afraid to rise up. We wanted to show our people that even if this was a football match it meant something else. Enough was enough. Sieg heil! Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil! The Hungarian team. They don't look like much. They have been practising, sir. We've given them many privileges to prepare for today. I know The Reich will prevail. But we must give a good performance. A believable one. - If you know what I mean. - Of course. I want those in attendance who are not rooting for us to feel good about the ability of their men... despite the final defeat. Of course. So do I, sir. But don't let their looks fool you. They are a feisty bunch. Like a pesky animal always looking for a way out. They will put up a fight. Good. They came at us wanting blood. - Ah! It's OK. - You alright? And Laszlo was right. They kept coming relentlessly. Left and right. Ooh! The Nazi team must have had the ball in its possession the entire half. We were dodging bullets and somehow, it was working. And as Laszlo had predicted they tried skipping their ground game and switching to an aerial game. Ooh! And when they tried going through the air we knew we had them in a panic. I have never seen a team try so hard and achieve so little. The more they shot... the more they missed. The more they missed... the more that seed of doubt we hoped to plant began to grow and spread. All we did was defend defend, defend. But Laszlo said to wait. So we waited and waited for the tiny crack. And just before the half... Franz! Bam! A bolt of lightning. And boy, were they stunned. That walk to the locker room will stay with me till the day I die. When I remember our team, for a moment there they were just like me. Like a little kid with the type of smile you get when you're fearlessly happy. Is this part of the celebration, Herr Woerns? I wonder if you have been feeding these prisoners better than we have our own players. Perhaps I should consider you to be hired the next time our team trains for a much more serious competition. Another month and you could have made these prisoners into world champions. I assure you, this is just luck. That is all. Nothing short of a glorious victory on the F√ºhrer's birthday is what we will see. I do hope so. We did not come to see '36 repeat itself. Absolutely not. If you will excuse me. What happens now? Karolyi, how's your ankle? I feel fine. I'll pull through. Good. What did I tell you? Goals are what counts! And when I look at the scoreboard. We're ahead. I love it! Do you think they'll offer us something in return for losing? Wait a second. What losing? But don't you think we have something to bargain with now? Nazis, they don't bargain. They take. So... I must congratulate you on an extraordinary but also a very lucky performance. It's not luck. It's skill. I hope you men don't mind but I need to borrow your captain for a brief moment. There's two of us. I will speak only to you, Laszlo. I'm sorry, Colonel wherever Laszlo goes... Don't you let that football uniform give you any sense of entitlement! Is that understood? This is an order! Yes. Laszlo. Outside, now. Laszlo the Great... trying to embarrass me. Congratulations, you're doing a mighty fine job. You wanted a match. You wanted drama and competition, so... What do you want? Tell me. You couldn't have come here without a plan? That's enough! No more games. I want each member of my team to be granted his freedom. Freedom. You remember that word? None of the men in that room have tasted it for a long while. You can't have it. Alright. Me for their freedom. That's what I want. I could do away with you any time I see fit. You could, before this match started. But now, from what I can see you're in a bit of a bind. Just as your Nazi team is. This is all just a spectacle for you. Freedom for them. You've got Europe at your feet. What's freedom to a few men to you? I cannot give you this. Don't you turn your back on me! What're you gonna do? Risk losing? I could promise you nothing and we could still prevail. You could prevail. But is it worth the risk? Your men's feet must be aching from all the missed shots. And don't forget, I'll be there waiting. Waiting for another mistake by your pretty team just as I was waiting a few minutes ago. Alright. Your team can only gain their freedom if they lose. I will tell my team that losing the match will get them their freedom. If we lose to them you get to walk. Yes. You get your freedom. All of us? No. I stay behind. No, no, no. That can't happen. We're a team. Must we be reminded that the one thing that Nazis have never given us, besides freedom is their word that nothing "bad" will happen to us. All our families are an example of that. What's the guarantee that they keep their word? There isn't one. It's up to each of you to decide. Lose a game... win freedom. Sounds about right. I'd say it's a fair deal. I can't tell you what to do. This isn't just about football. It's life. Let's go now! Whatever happens if we're winning when that clock up there shows "60" I don't wanna see you on the side-lines. Why, sir Laszlo? I... No matter what. You have to promise me! Find a place and hide there. Stay there, until everyone leaves Because they're gonna come and look for you. I promise. Yes. Laszlo, come on, let's go. Good. I didn't know why he wanted me to hide. I was confused and angry because if we won I wanted to be with them to celebrate. They were my team. My family. Ooh! Laszlo was the rarest of men. You could steal the game from him. You could make him bleed and try to break him down. You could take away his freedom. But his will to win? Never. What other men saw in his eyes on that day made them do something no one thought was possible. That little ant underneath David's foot had let out a roar that could make even a lion run with fear. I will be back, I promise. Needing a penalty? It's not the Reich's recipe for victory, Herr Woerns. Ja! My natural curiosity got the better of me on that day. I know I had promised Laszlo and I did... but I had to see my team again. I had to. Whatever the cost. Istvan is done. But we only have a few more minutes. He can't play. Tomasz, Tomasz! Have you ever been on goal? Good, now is your chance. Who will play defense now? Aron. Aron! - Remember what we practiced? - Yes. When in doubt, just kick the ball as hard as possible. - But far away from our side. - Yes. Come on. That was the last time I ever saw them. Laszlo didn't save me once. He saved me twice. What happened, Grandpa? What happened to them? Thirteen men died that day because they fought back. They died because they said "enough" to an evil that the world had never seen before. The beauty of football was kind to them that day. The ugliness of the world surrounding them... was not. Not a day goes by without me thinking of the happiness I saw on their faces. Football... resembles life sometimes. The struggle, the discipline... the sacrifice it demands. Remember that, David. Every time you play. And sometimes it saves a life. As it did mine. So every time you go out there and play always give your best. You owe it to the game and to what it represents. Laszlo was our best player but if he tried to do everything himself? You wouldn't have won. I couldn't have said it better myself. Come here. It's getting late. We better go. I don't want your mother to worry.
