Paleolithic era. 35000 AD. 37,000 years later. Iran. -Professor, Professor! Come quick! I found something. What's the matter with you now? Don't bother me little scoundrel! I found something. -If you keep running like that you will get you a canalicular diarrhea. Do you know that when a young body like yours is submitted to a heat above 45?C it provokes the shrinking of the skin cells that in the end produce an acid liquid that get in the alimentary canal and then it's the Sahara diarrhea for you! The equatorial trots, the bedouin runs! Breath through the nose. To lower your body temperature. Professor, come quick, I found something strange. Strange, you say? -It's there, Professor. -Where? Be careful, you're trampling it. -What am I trampling? -The eggs on the ground. By all the comets, Charles-Edouard, it's an extraordinary discover! Professor, my name is Steven. I was right, they're dinosaur eggs. No doubt about that. Give me your turban. It's to protect myself from the sun. You're young and healthy, young fool you have nothing to fear. And there's not too much sun now. Give me your turban. 3 years later. France. There's an awful stink in the air! You must have a stuffed-up nose. It alawys stinks. It's from that fucking box behind you. I don't know what's in it but the smell is awful. All the same, the yokels around here must use some mammoth turd to make their beets grow! Mammoth turd! You're too dumb! Nobody there? I'm coming! What's that noise? A delivery for you, Sir. I haven't ordered anything. What is it? I don't like surprise gifts. You're Mr P...r..i..o...u... Wait a minute. He can't read. Give me that. -Mr Prioux? -Yep, it's me. But it doesn't authorize you to give me your junk. I'm not in the mood to laugh. Three of my beasts have been devoured like some meat-burger by a fucking fox! Maybe it's a gift from one of your female fans? Don't joke, dirty bastard, or I'll give you a taste of the club I use to tame my cows! Alright, take it easy. We'll unload your stuff and we're gone. It's a free delivery. You can trow it in the trash if you don't want it. It's not our business. We're just delivery boys. We don't give a shit. If it's free then go on. But hurry up, I'm kinda busy. This thing not only stinks, it also weights two tons! Take it there. Carefully. One... two and three... Wait a minute. It's not for me. It's for my son Dimitri. The runt always had silly ideas. I don't have time to lose with his fads. Put it down. What's inside? Dimitri, Dimitri, come over here! It looks like some sort of aeration. As if there was an animal inside. -It would explain the smell. -Maybe it's a dog. It wouldn't smell so much. A dog is a human being like us. It washes itself. It's clean. It's a small puppy, listen, I hear him growling. Dimitri, damn you, come here. Take care of your business. Shut up. I'm trying to hear him. You shut up! You don't give me orders in my home. I yell as I want! Get out of here! I've seen enough of you! Come on, let's go! This old yokel gets on my nerves. -Listen! I hear it breathing. It must be hot as hell inside. What can it be? If my son bought another damn dog, I'm gonna give him hell! -Come on, let's go. We have work to do. -Puppy, puppy... -It must be hungry. -Come on. -We could open the box. Fuck! It's not a dog! We're in deep shit now! Well played! Your damn dog ate my finger! It's not mine, it's my son's! Get out of here! His finger, I must put his finger on ice. My finger, he ate my finger, fucking dog! -Help us, we need a doctor! -Call him yourself. It belongs to my son. You shouldn't have touched it! Help us, old crazy coot or I'll sue you! God darn it! It's alright, it's alright. You're trespassing! Get out of here or I'll shoot you in the nuts! -Old bastard, we will make you pay! Get back in the car. -Fuck, my hand, my hand! You'll have to find something else to wipe your ass! You'll pay for that. Remember Maurice Boyard Delivery service, motherfucker! It's not gonna begin again? I don't believe it. Let me watch. -Let me watch. -Wait a minute. I think you just forget something. Take this. For your charity work. Friendly price. Take it. Watch their engines. They're great. You come here often? Three, four times a week. It's the nudists favorite spot because of the lake. -The old Prioux knows about that? -Of course. He comes sometimes with his camera. He's shooting pictures and must make loads of money with the movies! -The old bastard! -He would be wrong to not enjoy it. Except there's a problem. -A problem? -Yeah. You know that Chief-Scout. He patrols here every sunday on behalf of morality. But what's he doing? He can't do much since it's a private spot but it seems he invented some kind of weapon to chase the nudists away. -A weapon to chase nudists? -Yes, buddy. Something dirty, you know Frigoules, like a water gun filled with a kind of melasses he throws at the girls. It's all sticky. The girls hate it. What a nasty man! -And she fucked with him? -Yeah, she fucked her brother-in-law's best friend in the cheerleaders locker room. Amazing, no? Not so much. She's a slut. -I'm a little bit hungry. -Don't move. I'll get the biscuits in the car. Dimitri. Open the door, it's me. I telling you to open up, Lazybones. What's the matter daddy? What's that damn smoke? You're going to set the house on fire. Let me in. Don't come in. You must not come in. I can't come in? By all the devils, why was I given such a crazy son? God damn it! What are you doing in there? You better find yourself a woman. It'd put some sense in your head. Anyway, take that box out of the entry way. It's noisy and it stinks! Okay daddy, my dear little daddy! The nice titties she had the big ones, amazing! Next time I'll bring a case of beer and we'll stay all day long. Hey, look at that! Take a ride with me, lovely Miss? Leave me alone! You know dolly, you look like the poster I put on the dog's door at home! -Don't be rude or I'll scream! -Wait we'll have a nice talk. What's your little name? -Wait! -What's wrong? -The other girls are coming? -I think I saw some kinda big fish... -Some big fish? Are you kidding me? -No, I have to be sure. Come back. I'm sure I saw something getting out of water. Probably the Loch Ness monster. Brignac! Brignac! Brignac! Brignac! Brig... Did you hear that? -What? I heard nothing. -Like a scream over there. A horrible scream. Probably the country yokels trying to be smart and attract our attention. You're probably right. -My God, it's horrible! -What? -Your back! You should put some cream on before you catch a sun burn. Thank you my darling. See you tonight. I will certainly be a bit late. The sub-prefect is coming to visit old Augustin's farm. It seems the old man wants to turn it into a camp and he needs authorization. Ah, I almost forgot. Your tapes of Passion & Novel are on the vhs-recorder. I recorded episodes 98, 99, 100 & 102. -And episode 101? -Episode 101? You're right, they forgot to show it. It's odd. How can I understand episode 102 without watching episode 101 first? -I have to go or I'll be late. See you tonight my lovely. Bill, bill and another bill! That one for instance. A 345 francs bill for a restaurant! What's that shit? You haven't taken me to a restaurant for a century! You still stuffed yourself while I was starving at home. I'm sure you were eating like a pig with some slut. I already told you! It was a business lunch! Yeah right! Have fun without me! Dirty bastard! I promise. We'll be better soon. Fortune's wheel will soon turn for JoJo the clown. Like in the good old times when we were JoJo and Fifi, kings of the rififi! I have a new show coming. Business will be good again. My fist will come soon to your face if you don't stop your show without me. Fifi is in jail for drug trafficking and you should be with him. You know I have nothing to do with his bullshit. Get out of here! It's time! They're waiting for you at the mall. If they sack you it's the end for us! Bitch! People may talk... but I'm feeling better now. It's true. They didn't show episode 101. Highly ilogical. They showed episode 101. I remember since I recorded it. And then straight to 102. Like a time-warp jump in the twilight zone. Darn! How short is our life! Life is a great whirlwind making everything waltz. Success, misery, love, glory... and the pain in the ass! All is but an illusion. A mirage. Did I really kill her or did I just dream of killing the bitch? After 15 years together... but she was still a bitch! Better not think too much about it. Especially before my show. Alex! Alexandra! What are you doing with the biscuits? Alexandra! I'm catching you filthy sinners desecrating with your naked bodies the wild splendour created by God for the happiness of all! Please, Sir. Don't hurt us. We're leaving at once. Stop whinning! Don't you see this guy is straight out of the asylum? Sir, leave this place at once or my friends will come to demolish your face! You don't demolish the face of the friends of Jesus, Miss! And I'm warning you that it would be better for you to put more clothes on your body! He's crazy! I'm a practising Catholic, it's not the same! And I'm at the head of a 38 boy-scouts squad who can make fire with stones and sing mass in Latin! I'm ordering you in heaven's name to put something on, a cloth, a costume, a textile, an old rag, something to hide what should stay out of sight of our Lord's young and innocent children. Hasten up or else... Or else ? What will you do? I can make the apocalypse horns spit! A celestial flood engulfing sin and fornication in a purifying ocean! I conceived this melasses gun for such occasions and thank God it works like a charm! Repent, sinners! Sin is tattoed on your skins! Repent or you will be forever tainted with melasses by God's grace! You really want me to come and have a look at you? Fucking junk! You think it's funny your failure trick? It seems that everybody today wants to piss off a clown! What scum! Look at that. It doesn't wash off. -My tan is ruined now. -I told you this spot was full of evil repute. This bastard humiliated us. At least if he had murdered us we would have our picture in the newspaper. This beast is busy eating these two broads. It looks like a kinda crocodile or lizard or... That's it. I know, this thing looks like a... a dinosaur? God in heaven! A dinosaur? I'd better not call the cops. Sure this beast has devoured these two dolls but I bumped another one... This kind of things happen! A fucking dinosaur! You don't see that every day. It must be an exceptional spot. Maybe it was my lucky day passing around this place. There certainly is a load of money to make with such an act! JoJo the clown and his incredible dinosaur! Come many to Dinosaurland, the new attraction park with a real... Dinosaur! Great, great! Business is back again! First not a word to anyone, especially cops and firemen. They could steal it from me. Nobody shall know that... Something wrong Sir? Not at all. Everything's right and in the rules. -You're looking for your Circus? -Sorry? You're dressed like a sad clown and seem nervous. Thought you were looking for your Circus. It's because of my costume. No, I'm just an entertainer. I saw you 4 years ago taking kicks in the butt from a hat wearing bear in the village hall. A dinosaur, hmmm, a bear with a hat? No it wasn't me. Probably a colleague. -Can I call a wrecker for you? -No, I'm fine. I just stopped to breath some fresh country air and to pick pretty flowers for my wife. I mean, my daughter, my nice daughter. All is rolling and if it wasn't rolling I would have told you. Alright. Park better next time you're breathing air. I must admit I stopped abruptly when I saw these lovely crocus, gladiolus, well these lovely flowers. You call that lovely flowers? We call them butt stickers. Because they're not very high and grow by the roads. Oh yeah, very funny, yes, yes! Good day Sir. Thank you. Very kind from your kindness. Patrick! By all the saints, I have to talk to you. You again, tell me Villiers, I hope you're not using that gear to poach. You must listen to me Patrick. I saw a ghastly thing by the lake earlier. Your nudists again making you all sweaty? Listen, I think this time God is really trying to test us. You said that when McDonalds set up in the village. What's happening now? What I saw earlier is beyond your imagination, you must believe me. What are you talking about? Listen, I'll show you the way. There! There! It's there! Now tell me what all this is about. I've seen the beast, the demon. Follow me. The creature I saw was not God's creation, I can assure you. Tell me, old boy, you're still seeing that Doctor? You think I'm crazy but you will change your mind when you see it. With blood dripping off its jaws and fire flying out of his eyes. I've heard of a rabid fox hanging around. I've not seen it with my own eyes but maybe this animal is in a real bad shape and looks like a monster. You should not worry so much. But I'm tellin you I've seen this beast in that cursed lake! Will you believe me once and for all! Prehistoric Life Studies Center Monday I'm loving you, Tuesday I'm loving you, Wednesday I'm loving you and the other days too. Stop, please stop singing, Dino, when I'm examining micro-cells. It gives me headaches. -Professor, it's one of my tunes. I will sell it on TV and it's going to be a hit. Everybody will sing... Monday I'm loving you, Tuesday I'm loving you, That's what I feared. We made a terrible mistake, Dino. A terrible mistake. Professor, we couldn't predict the eggs would give birth to these creatures. True, it's a miracle. The knowledge we had then could not allow us to predict this. Nevertheless, we made a mistake so big that I don't know how we can make up for it. You want to speak about... -About our idea to sell those eggs through ads in Illustrated Paleontology or Dinosaur Magazine. I told myself then, we found so many of these beautiful prehistoric green eggs that we could make a profit out of them. We will sell them everywhere in France, send them by mail, it will finance our researchs. And it will make these people so happy to have their own dinosaur egg. We received orders from everywhere in France. We received orders from Russia, Italy, and even Yokeltown! It was gigantic bullshit! A big-giga- screw up that we must never repeat! Professor, we'll be more careful next time. If the authorities learn that we sent them here and there dozens of eggs able after all these years to give birth to such ferocious monsters it's the end of the Institute and our work. We must get back all the eggs, all of them! Professor, here is the list of all the buyers. Your crew is ready to leave but concerning the refunds, Professor... No! Don't tell me you already spent all the money? Professor, I fitted the laboratory with a huge karaoke machine. So everyone can sing... Monday I'm loving you, Tuesday I'm loving you, Here we are at your famous lake. Where is that satanic monster of yours? You will hear him growling very soon. I don't hear anything growling. Listen now. Go back home. I'm going to survey the area and if I find a sick animal threatening public order... And this, and this, and this... maybe it's the work of a rabid fox? In God's name, what is that? "That" is one of the beast's first victims. And there will be many others if we don't set up a gigantic exorcism to deliver the area from the devil's presence. Stop speaking nonsense. I'm taking care of this case. This rabid dog was certainly very angry. We will set up a beat. You have to set up an exorcism, not a beat! -Mummy! -Back! Devil's creature! Say, you saw it, it's really an evil creature. You saw that, it spits all the fires from hell. You saw it, say it, Patrick, say it, say it, huh, say it! What do you say about that? I wanted to show you my little boy! Mummy! What's the matter with you, Patrick? Answer, answer! Say it, say it, Answer me, Patrick, you saw it? We must get out of here! Do you hear me? The devil came because the place was tainted by sin. We must fight him as good christians! We must call the army! I see you finally got the box out of the way. Yes daddy. It was a big box. Can you tell me what was inside? Nothing very important. Some tools for my experiments. Stinking and growling tools? You call that some tools. Sonny you must stop playing dumbass with your father. Listen Dad, I'm working on an experiment that will revolutionize biological science. It's of the highest importance! Stop your bullshit, I don't understand. If I knew you'd ruin me with your whims I would never have sent you to school. I'm getting old now and I talked with the banker last time I went to the city. I've decided to transform the farm into a tourist complex with guests rooms and all the rest... Now you'll have to do your follies somewhere else! -But Daddy... -I don't want to know what you're scheming. But I'm warning you. The sub-prefect will come this afternoon with the country policeman to check if all is according to the law to greet the tourists and to start the renovation work. I don't want trouble, understand. You stay in your room. My experiments are of the highest importance to mankind. I can't stop them under the pretext that you've decided to turn the farm into a motel-restaurant! Shut up lout, you don't know what you're talking about! "Green tourism is the future of the rural world" as they say. With the lake nearby I have gold in my hands. And I won't let you spoil everything. You will have to move. And there's nothing to add! Green tourism is your old man's retirement plan. Get that in your head once and for all. -How far is it to that place? -Very near, Mr Raoul, we're very near. Delalande, I told you to call me Mr Jean-Charles Delalande. -Better for business and it's the current name on my papers. -Over there. Finally. I'm certain this attraction park can make us millionaires. Calm down. I must see your dinosaur still. I only believe what I see. First I see it and then we make a decision. You will be very enthusiastic. Say, I'm a little short on money and since we're partners now I thought maybe you could give me a little advance... Are you deaf or dumb? Didn't you hear what Raoul just said to you? I'm like this guy buying coffee in that tv commercial. If it's good coffee, OK, I'm buying, I give you cash. If the coffee is bad I prefer not lelling you know what I'll do with you. Next client is a certain Dimitri Prioux. -He ordered two times. -The address? Prioux Farm. Cow Mountain. It sounds like a shit hole. You will wake me up when we're there. We'll ask that guy there the way. I must warn them! Please, dear friend, could you show me the way to Prioux Farm. Run away Lady! Don't stay here! You must go back! The green monster will eat you raw! That's it. Here we are. Where's your monster? We'll walk around the lake and I'm sure it will come out and say hi! It'd be better for you. No, don't go there, come back! Come back! Believe me. I'm a deputy! They will all be eaten alive! Strange speech! That guy didn't seem to feel very well. Alcohol is a plague around here. If you want my opinion, this guy had the face of a man who just saw a dinosaur. We should switch on our detectors. Fuck! Look at that slimy shit! I'm all wet now! -I'm holding you responsible for everything happening to me. -Give me your hand. My crocodile shoes are ruined. It's a disaster. I knew I could not trust a guy with your face. You want my shoes? Are you plain crazy? You see me wearing shoes two miles long! Sorry, I wasn't careful. -Exactly, be more careful if you don't want to get me nervous and dangerous. Look a pair of slippers. It's better. It doesn't go too well with the suit but beggars can't be choosers. Bring the slippers. It looks like... Yes, it's blood. Their owner was probably eaten by my, I mean, by our dinosaur. Are you nuts? You want me to wear a dead man's slippers? You're amazing. You're playing with your life, you know. -Bingo. I've got one on the radar. -What's the matter? Why're you waking me? -I caught something on the dino-receptor. -It means one of them is in the area. Is it a living creature? -In theory yes. The signal appears only if the creature is alive. -Lead us to the place. -Finally we'll get a look at one of these big babies. Take care of my big toe. You're such a jerk, Clown! Listen, it sounds like a car. I'm warning you. If it's the cops, I'm taking you as hostage. In the lake! I knew it. Our creature is a sea creature. Come over here Misses. Come have a look. Do you know the reason for the unusual color of the water? For this kind of lake I mean. -No, Professor. What does it mean? -I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. It certainly means something. I have the feeling this lake is full of surprises for scientists like us. Let's put the gear in place and fast. Sabrina, please plug in the detectors. It's ok. The dino-meter's on. I'm sorry to ask you this but we'll have to proceed as we did in 1994. During our study trip in Ibiza. You're right Pr. We need to put on our camouflage outfit. Put your work clothes on, dear colleague. Shit! They're taking their clothes off! They're good looking girls, don't you think? -Shut up or they will spot us. -Is it okay with you Professor? -Wonderful. You'll pass for happy-go-lucky tourists. Nobody'll suspect the importance of our work. -But you not wearing your disguise? -I forgot my bathing suit at the Institute. -Theses bozos will be eaten by the dinosaur, you'll see! -It's all I'm asking for. Take care of our client, Mr Prioux. I will verify that he still has the eggs with him. Very well! Mr sub-prefect will be accompanied. Very well! Around 6 o'clock. I'm waiting for him. This jerk won't be here before 6 o'clock. It gives me some time to have my fun at the lake. Fuck, I can't stand it anymore! I have a cramp in my leg. I think I was really stupid to trust a schmuck like you! -A clown, Mr Raoul. -Mr Delalande, I told you! I'm sorry. I'm sure something is going to happen. All these scientists are not here by chance. If there's a dinosaur in this lake we must take it back with us. It will be a fantastic scientific discovery! We could put electrodes on him. Signals are more and more intense Professor. I think it will show itself soon. Did you think about the camera? To take my picture near the dinosaur. Holy cow! Nice titties! What's up? One can't work in peace at home without being disturbed? -Of my God, you scared me to the bone! -God has nothing to do inside you. Don't bother if you don't get it. You know, my dear child... That dinosaur will bear my name. The Rassic creature. What a nice name! My picture will be in the dictionnary. Not before he shows himself. Signals are getting sparse. What? What are you saying? Come over here, show yourself! Don't be dumb! Signals are diminishing more and more, Professor. I beg you, show yourself. It's me, Jules Rassic! I spent my life studying you. I wasn't expecting a visit. Especially not from a young lady hardly dressed. Yes, hmm, it's a camouflage dress. Sorry to disturb you but I'm part of Pr Rassic's team. The famous Paleontologist. Exactly. I'm here to see you since you're on the list of people who got an egg from us. An egg? A green egg, big like this. I can't remember. I only know chicken eggs, they're much smaller and they're not green. Maybe you got an animal instead of an egg. Maybe the egg hatched in the parcel and I... Don't bother me, Miss. I understand nothing of your story. You look more like a prostitute to me and if you don't want me to call the police I advise you to take your butt and the rest out of my house and run away! Please, don't misunderstand me, I only have to... -You have nothing to do here! It's odd, he seems to know. I have to check this out. God darn it! What are they doing with that gear? So? What do the signals say? They're very weak. I'm trying a little further. They seem to be crazy, both the old bearded man and the brunette with big tits. I tell you, I have ants on my leg! What a moron! My foot is in the middle of an ant hill! -Shit! Shit! Shit! I can't stand it here! -Come on, shut up or we'll be spotted. They're running on me! If you get up one more time I'll whack you! Understood? Gee, that's a big clue! Professor, I found a bone! I can't hear you, my poor friend! I fell on a bone. Come have a look. A prehistoric rhino? You probably mean the rhinoceratops. It'd be unable to survive in such conditions. It's a bone, Professor. Looks like a human tibia. Somebody was ripped to the bone in this lake. How? It's very rude of you to speak of my wife this way. The jaws of this beast must be extremely powerful. It must have been busy mangling people. Before showing it in a museum we must make an test. Come back now. Come back now. -I'm talking about the jaws, Professor! -What kind of gloss? This animal must be huge! What is she talking about? How stupid of me to hire young tarts out of the University! Professor, I think we should be more careful. Holy shit! It's him! Fuck! It's my monster! Look! He's eating everybody! Beware, come out of the water! What? Of course I have water on my breast. It's there! Behind you! Come back! I don't understand why you're saying that Professor! Oh, it's awful! God darn it! If only I had a camera! How nice! A dinosaur! In our times! A fucking dinosaur! Do you picture the dollars falling in our pockets! Dinosaurland! Smart guy! I knew I could trust you! Thank you, Sir. We must not lose time. You're right, Clown. We must buy these lands as fast as possible. I got the money so don't try to con me! -You know very well I'm dumber than you. -That's better. Shit! I'm sure it's another experiment gone awry from my dumbass son! My project will go to the toilet with this fucking crocodile story. If the sub-prefect sees that I'm done. Finally you're going to be very useful. I was looking for someone like you. Not to marry you, I can assure you. Although you don't look that bad compared with the village girls with warts on their noses. No, in fact, you will help me in my work. You will be a kind of collaborator. Imagine that my father is not the ideal subject. He has a bad drinking habit. Which is very bad for experiments in general. I'm convinced that you'll be a much better guinea-pig than him! Oh Lord... give me the strength to fight back this threatening demon, the product of sin and fornication. That scaly beast, help me to throw it back into hells fire. Give me the strength, Oh Lord, to convince my brothers of the danger they're facing living in sin and pornography and blaspheming the holy church by wearing condoms and abandoning their souls to atheism. Grant me your mercy! I will have this viscous Satan spitting his guts until his eyes spurt out of his head. If need be I will crush his jaw with a sledgehammer and his naughty bits too! Amen. This will be my holy crusade! Where are we now? We're very near Mr sub-prefect. We've been driving for an hour. It doesn't look good. It's amazing how these fields all look alike. Landscape lacks variety. I hate the country areas. I asked for my transfer to the Martinique. Driver, we'll ask this aboriginal the way . Stop! Stop! This man seems a little bit nervous. You must not go! Go back that way! All the people must evacuate! He seems a bit retarded, Mr sub-prect. Ask him all the same. We can't spend the evening asking our way. Could you show us the way to Prioux Farm, dear Sir? Evacuate Mrs! At first I thought it was a fox but it's a monster! A green one and he eats everybody! Evacuate! What is he saying? He says he saw Godzilla! Godzilla? He's running behind the car! Very well. Driver, speed up. What exactly is that "Godzilla"? Say, I didn't meet you before? -Me? -Yes, you the loony guy! At the town hall, you had a bear with a hat kicking your butt! -A hat wearing bear? -Yep! It's odd. Everyone keeps telling me this. Or it's someone who looks like you. With all due respect, Mr Prioux, we have more important matters to talk about. Are you interested in our offer? Say, Mr Delalande, what's so interesting in my lands for you to offer so much money? I already told you Mr Prioux. It's a sentimental reason. My father died in the war and I was raised by my uncle Lucien. He was a farmer and grew rutabaga before suffering from multiple sclerosis. Rutabaga was his passion and his dream was for me to keep on his path and become a farmer growing rutabaga, you understand? And then? And now the most important thing for me is to make my Uncle who will die soon proud of me. I want him to say to the priest who will give him extreme unction : My son is in the rutabaga business like his uncle, Father. And you know what, Mr Prioux? I've never seen a better land than yours to have rutabaga growing on. I swear on my life. The price means nothing to me. Is that so? It's like I'm tellin you. I've got the papers, a pen, We can sign immediately. This way I'm paying my debt to my uncle who loved me all his life as if I was his own son. You can wipe yourself clean with your papers! I don't give a damn about your dumb story! My dumb story! This guy doesn't believe my story! I don't believe a word of your rubbish. And you don't exactly look like a guy interested in rutabaga. And my lands are not for sale. I've got other plans. Go see Favreaux. At this price he will sell you his wife and his eight kids! Listen, Mr Prioux. Allow us to ask you again. We can give you more. -Money's not a problem for us. -Slow down, Clown. We need your lake. You need the lake? And why are you so interested in the lake? -Holy Bozo! -Get the hell out, scumbags! Nobody will buy my farm. You're sure? There's no deal? You're a bunch of dirty rats! God darn it! God darn it! God darn it! God darn it! Fucking slippers! Bravo! You've been a big help! I had to suggest a more credible project! You call razing the farm and building a Circus school a credible project? What a load of bullshit! It drove him completely mad! I told you we had to win him with the heart. Green tourism is the future! Nobody will take my farm and my lake from me! Nobody! Look! This yokel asshole hit me in the belly! It's true. You're bleeding! Of course, we're in deep shit, Clown! I need to sit down. We should snuff the candle of this old madman! Take care of me first! How does it look? It's not very pretty. It looks like buckshot. Fuck! Don't touch it! -You know something about surgery? -I'm a clown. Not a doctor! Listen, Clown. I can't keep pissing blood all day long! You got to get the buckshot out. Then make a bandage. Alright? -Sorry Mr Raoul. Impossible. I can't stand seeing blood. It's better if I take you to a Doctor. I'll leave you there and after I... I promise I'll come back. Not a good idea. Listen to me good, asshole. It's time to stop the bullshit. I'm out of jail and on probation. You get it? I don't want to go back because of a shitty Clown who offered me a deal which is turning very bad. You understand now? We'll fix this between us, okay? -Okay, okay. Try to find something which looks like tweezers to take the buckshot out, okay? Tweezers? Tweezers? Hurry up, Clown! Stop struggling like this. You're disturbing me in my work. How? What do you mean? Wait until I remove your gag. I beg you, Professor. Make the injection in my right buttock, not in the shoulder. Decidedly guinea-pigs nowadays are more and more demanding. Wait, wait! I also wanted to tell you that I find you very attractive. -What now? You don't like me? Look at my breasts. Another time Miss. You see I'm trying to experiment now. I want to experiment too. I want your body! Ah, women! -My knight! -You're not serious? Take me to heaven! No, not this. Professor, you... You're so fucking clumsy, pay attention for god's sake! I'm not a Doctor and it disgusts me. It's your fault if I'm here. You and your damn Dinosaur! -It was a golden opportunity. -We couldn't buy the fields. It's over! -You tear my belly up! -Don't struggle so much. I can't work! You think I'm enjoying it maybe? Shit, I'm going to faint. If you faint I'll shoot you. Understand? That's enough now. Dimitri, God darn it, what are you doing with that girl? Dad, you're not permitted to come in this room. I'll remind you that it's my house. What's the matter with all these people trying to eject me? Get out of here immediately! Talk better to your old man or I'll shoot you like I shot these two guys! First, who's that girl? It's a friend from school. -Untie her. -But Dad, she's helping me in my work. The sub-prefect is coming. I don't want any screw-ups. You can do your naughty work later. Send her away! Think about it... Better to hide her in my room. Wait, I'm gonna mop you up a bit. I'll withdraw the last one. It might hurt a little bit. -I told you to be more careful! -The shoulder! You hit me in the shoulder! -I missed you. -But this is blood! You shoot at me. Don't be so dumb. It's my blood on you. I didn't shoot at you. You understand? Why am I hurting so bad if you didn't shoot me? -You got a gun? -If you don't stop being so rude with me... I shoot you in the face. I mean it you know. I killed my wife this moring. Relax, asshole, relax. We won't shoot at each other. -Anyway I'm a better shooter than you. -I won't argue, you didn't miss my shoulder. I just brushed it. Let me see. We'll put a bandage around it. I want you to put your gun away and to stop shooting at me. Alright. We'll put the guns away. Shooting at your partner is not cool. Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen. Hello Mr Prioux. I'll introduce you to Mrs Laforet. Departmental coordinator of the Welcoming Farm programme. -I'm sorry. I'm not fit to be seen. -Don't worry. The Welcoming Farm is bringing a generous and innovative idea : Merging progress and country living while operating a synergy between local tourism and economic growth. I wasn't at school very long. I can barely make head or tail of the new money. -Well, let's put it this way : It's as part of this programme that your tourist project of guest-house, etc could eventually be funded. It sounds better to my ear! Before that, you can imagine that we need to take a close look at your project. Your project must meet a good deal of parameters especially concerning the environment. You don't have to worry about that. I'll do my best. Great. I thought we would meet the country policeman here to lead us in our tour. He should be here already. I don't know why he's so late. In that case we will wait for him. At God's grace! Hey! -Hey you, over there! -Who are you? -You see that I'm busy. -You can't stay here. It's not the place for a good christian. The devil has taken possession of the area. What are you talking about? I've been the witness this morning of an extraordinary vision! But does this dismembered body belong to you? That? They're the remains of one of my collaborators. A good girl. The Dinosaur took the rest of her body. This unfortunate child must be given a decent burial. What's the use? She will make a very good pasture to feed the rich fauna of this area. The earth is alive, you know. It must be given water and food. By all the Saints, you have seen the beast too! Our triceanosor-crocodilus? of course I saw it! I was putting my thoughts on record. You can count on me, my brother. I won't fail. -Counting on you? -To destroy the beast! -Are you crazy? -It's not a creature of God, it's the devil himself! What's that nonsense? I plan to take this animal alive to the Institute. It's not ideal my brother to get in the way of God's will which is guiding my footsteps. So long, poor sinner. Say, you're sure he will come this country policeman? I have lots of files to deal with at the subprefecture. We can start the tour without him. He will rejoin us. I'm going to show you the parcel for the golf course. -A golf course here? -Why not? I also have a lake for my water skiing project. Follow me. It's our turn to have fun! This old bastard is going to regret the day he was born! What's all this junk? It looks like a clandestine lab. Maybe this asshole is making bootleg alcohol or something like that. I know. You remember that thing biting my finger? It was a wild animal. This bastard is smuggling wild animals! Here is the golf course. A golf course in a beet-root field? There are too many bumps in this parcel. A good go with my tractor and it's in the pocket, Mr sub-prefect. The Welcoming Farm programme is not really suited to this kind of set up. We wish above all to marry tourism and country life in an educational purpose. This kind of project requires a great deal of permissions. Exactly Mr sub-prefect and I was thinking maybe we could have a deal just between you and me. To avoid the paperwork. I guess you must be kidding? It's my cousin in Sicilia who told me to ask you. -He's kidding, right? -Probably, Mr sub-prefect. We nearly died with laughter, you know. Tourists will love your sense of humor. Well, let's have a look at the lake now. Great! I'm sure we'll find interesting stuff in there. We'll make the whole place explode! A real fourth of July! Nothing interesting here. Boris? Boris? We're pissing too much blood. We need a Doctor. Look! A car in front of the farm! We've got to stun the driver. Let me do it. Beware! Someone's coming. Let's hide. Let me show you the way. Mr sub-prefect. Miss. -A little sip of my booze? -No thank you. It's very kind of you. So? When will I get the money for the works. Listen good, Mr Prioux. Your case must be shown first to the commitee but I can already tell you I will give my entire approval. There's enough space to build a very strong project in case the samplings don't show too much soil polllution. Always the same. It lasts forever. -Professor, it's awful! -Oh, Katia! Where have you been? -You missed the show. Our beast made an appearance. -Where is Sabrina? The unfortunate girl died for the scientific cause. I could not prevent it. Oh, it's horrible! There are terrible things happening on that farm. You must come and have a look. Other creatures? Yes, I'm afraid. We will need all the hypodermic syringes at our disposal. I'll finish writing my memories another time. Mr, I've been eaten. Ok, that's alright. It was Jean-Louis. He says he has been eaten. Good for him. You should have told me? I would have brought some sausage to your guy. I'm fed up! -Which way is the exit out of this mess? -I think I've got a problem. -My nose is bleeding. -And you think I'm not bleeding my share? -I need a Doc. -Maybe we can get out this way. No we can't. Something is growling. -Open the door! -No way. -I'm telling you to open the door! Ok, it's alright. -And now you're following me! -Ok, I'm following you. That's better. Mr Raoul, it's a baby dinosaur! Wait, I'm going to give him some lead. Mr Raoul? Shit, I killed him! In heaven's name! What are these awful screams? Some screams? I heard nothing. I heard them too. Like someone thrown in boiling water or having his finger hit with a hammer. Yep, it's the piglets being stuck. It's the country tradition, first sunday of every month, we kill the pig and we have a party with our friends next week to eat the pig's head. You don't have to worry. I wasn't aware of this lovely tradition. It has begun! They're attacking! You must go! -It's the madman we saw earlier. -Yes he's insane. There's an asylum nearby. Mr sub-prefect! You must leave the area! What does this mean in the end? The surroundings seem of ill repute. Don't be afraid. They're harmless. It's still very annoying for a tourist spot. The Dino-serum! I will be able to save mankind! Well, Mr Prioux, we won't take more of your precious time. My office will keep you updated. -Please could you direct me to the Ladies room? Not very hard to find. On your right and then on your left at the end of the corridor. Tell me, speaking of commodities... What do you have in mind concerning sanitary installations? Sanitary installations? Is it really necessary? Would you like a little Dino-serum injection? Is it still your pig yelling like a woman? Wait a sec. I'll have a look. God darn it! God darn it! What's this mess? It screams everywhere. If it's still your experiments I will give you a beating you won't forget. It would not have happened if my lab was not so full of people passing by! What's that shit on the floor! There's meat everywhere. What is she doing here? She saw everything. She will tell everyone. And that beast I saw in the lake this morning? Still another of your inventions? They are genuine prehistoric specimens. But they seem to have gone crazy! I cannot control them anymore! You got us in deep shit again! I heard everything. Murder, accesory to murder, poaching, detaining and smuggling of wild animals against country regulations. Give yourself up. You're under arrest! Wait a second. You know me, I'm not a bad guy. My damned son is the sole cuprit! I'm a scientist and I'm ordering you to get out of my laboratory! You're completely insane both of you. Come with me to the police precinct! I've succeeded! I've succeeded! I'm a genius! I injected her the Dino-serum of my own making and it works! She's covered with scales! I've tried for months to create a new race, half-man, half-dinosaur, the perfect compromise between strength and brains! -What's going on in this house? -Mr sub-prefect! -First, where's my collaborator? I ask you to explain immediately. -I introduce you to my son Dimitri. -What's the meaning of this circus? My God! Mrs Laforet! What happened? It's this madman, Sir! He came from nowhere armed with this giant sledgehammer and he tried to kill all of us! It was a massacre! -I was almost killed! -He must be arrested. He's a dangerous maniac. He tried to harm you earlier. I will try to bring him back to reason. Calm down, my dear friend. Calm down. It's over. No one will hurt you. Come on, stand up. What are you waiting for? Go get some help. We'll do it as fast as possible. Nobody call the cops. Hands up everyone. -I warn you, I'm not in a good mood. -Is this a joke or what? -You, white-collar, stay by the retard. Got it? -I'm inside an asylum! -What now, yokel? You're not so smart without your gunshot! Right? All this is a misunderstanding. Let me tell you how I'm admiring your artistic skills. You've seen my shows? I saw you a few years ago at the town hall. A show with a bear if I remember correctly. It wasn't me. I tell you it wasn't me! I never gave a show in this rotten hole! And I never owned a bear! My show was JoJo and Fifi, kings of the rififi! The next time someone talks about a hat wearing bear butt-kicking me, I'll whack him! Understood? It's there, Professor. On the ground. It looks like blood. The poor man. We cannot do anything for him anymore. I told you, Professor. The Dinosaurs are in a very bad mood! It's not very far! What do you want from me? I'm just a poor farmer. I want your lands. You haven't understood it yet? Never. That's all my old ma left me when she died. Listen, you can settle that and leave me out of this. -Everybody stays here. -We'd better leave. It's dangerous around here. -Is that so? Why? Nothing worse could happen to me now. Katia, Katia, don't panic! -Aim at the head. -Ok Professor, I'll try. -Katia, keep your cool. Aim at the head. I'll try but it moves all the time. I missed the head, Professor! -You shouldn't have, Katia! Let me pass, Katia, let me pass! Don't leave me here! Don't leave me alone! Professor, close the window, close the window! I don't know how! Which button is it? Help! Help! You see that, Professor? He left when you turned on the radio. Yes, you're right. It's amazing! Would music soften up a Dinosaurs temper? If I may speak, Mr Prioux, I'm deeply, very deeply disappointed by your behavior. I beg you. Sign this selling act than we'll be free to go home. My son has a problem with his pets. His pets? What kind of pets? -Go on, tell him about the beasts! -They're Dinosaurs, not pets. Brought back to life thanks to the discovery of a famous paleontologist. I own two specimens but it seems that they've became completely berserk. It's them causing this massacre. But you just said it was this Sir doing all .... If I said that then I lied. Come on, we're in the middle of a bad movie or what? Dinosaurs now... I'm inclined to believe all this is just a bad joke. Shut your trap! The boy is right. We'll proceed in two steps. Step 1. You sign. Step 2. We get out of here. -Or we will all be crushed to a pulp. -Too late! -Goddarnit! Goddarnit! -Good heavens! Gee... -Are you catholic? -Let me go. -Come. -Who're you? I'm sent by God's will! -Could someone tell me what's the situation here? -The situation, my brother, is that all the parish is the prey of the Devil! -We have to fight the invasion of monstruous creatures -It doesn't make sense. We have to call the police to put an end to this collective hysteria. Don't refuse to see the lightning truth my brother! You just saw the creature. We must cut his head off and exorcise the house. I haven't seen anything my dear Sir. I don't believe this. These so-called creatures only exist in your head. Everyone is just plain crazy! Just plain crazy? If you don't believe my word maybe you will accept the visual proof of the coming armaggedon. An amateur tape from old Prioux's private VHS collection. But it's awful! It looks like a prehistoric monster! We must set the evacuation plan in motion, the red alert, the... Back! Back! Unholy demon! It's odd... No more noise. We must cut his head off and exorcise! If you touch only one scale of this rare specimen I will personnaly bring you to hell! We'll see that later, Professor. We must take care of the other specimen in the lake. These people are the devil's accomplices! Now I know where my duty lies! So that's the thing they called their pets. Mrs Laforet! How do you feel? Come on, Miss! Get a grip of yourself. And put on some clothes. Electric fence for my cows! First time I'll push it up to the max! The bastard is going to dance to hell! It reminds me of a fucking movie. Can't remember the name... I wouldn't like to be in the place of his balls right now! Dinosaur, Dinosaur! -Dino, Dino, Dino! -Come over here Dino, don't be afraid! -We'll feed you. -We will take you with us. We'll give you a kennel with a basin. -Look Professor! -I saw it moving. We see his little muzzle. Look what I'm doing to your damned beast! Sir! The faculty forbids you to raise the hand on this first choice water proof Dinosaur! I'll give him some lead! I hope he likes it! It's his fault if everything turns to vinegar. Say your prayer, filthy beast! Daddy, no! You can't do that! Get outta here, runt! I disinherit you! -Take this! I always dreamed of taking a header in this lake! Oh, look there, Katia! The Dinosaur's coming! Look, Katia, it's coming near us! There's a strange glimmer in his eyes. It doesn't like us. You're right, it seems a bit nervous. Come on, Dinosaur, it's me, Jules Rassic! You're not going to bite us, Dino! Professor, help! Remember Katia, this Dinosaur species is a music lover! Come on, let's sing! Dinosaurs are not bad eggs, Dinosaurs are not bad fellas, Dinosaurs are not bad eggs, Dinosaurs are not bad fellas. Dino! Sleep, sleep, sleep, my friend, Sleep, sleep, sleep, my friend, Sleep, sleep, sleep, my friend, my dear little friend. It's OK now. It fell asleep. Dino, you're wonderful! You saved our lives! -It's nothing. I love to sing. -You turned up in the nick of time. Professor, I remembered that I was singing a lot in the reserve where eggs where stocked. These creatures have recollections of my tunes. It's normal, Professor. It's scientific! In truth, I'm tellin you, time has come for the last judgment! Who is this hysterical guy? Here we are, me and my courageous scouts, on our holy crusade! Get ready to die, sinners and monsters, because the hand of God is guiding our arms! He's a scout with two disconnected wires in the head. Listen, Professor! What's that noise? It's the rumbling of punishment! It looks like... a... By all the Saints! Who are you? We come from Metalluna-2 to collect the two last Astro-Dinosaurs. We've used your planet to have the eggs of our pets hatch because of Earth's climate. Don't touch this Dinosaur, it's mine. Danger! Alert! Spatio-Desintegrator activated! Then Dinosaurs would be aliens? Dino, my savior, take me to Venezia! We will hold each other's hands, we will kiss each other on the cheek, on the cheek, on the cheek! We will write some tunes to win a little money, how sweet, how sweet, how sweet! We will kiss each other, We will hold each other's hands... -Professor! Not you. You can't sing, Professor. It's you, Joris? I recognize you without the fake nose. -Patrick! I knew I already saw you somewhere. It's me, Patrick, your twin brother. You remember? Mum always told me you were kidnapped by gypsies. I followed the Circus passing on the road in front of the house. What a jerk! Joris! Joris... Fucking destiny! Fucking dinosaur! We will play to "daddy and mummy". You're okay my darling? Hydrotherapy allowed Patrick to forget this nightmare. Nowadays he works part-time in a Zoo near Paris. Katia married Dino who became a star. Their marriage made the front page of "Paris-Match', 'Voici" and "Mad Movies". Chief-Scout now lives in the backwoods as a wild animal with Miss Laforet. They have six healthy kids with claws. They were sighted recently near a stable running behind a calf. Local Police opened an investigation. Professor Jules Rassic was sentenced to jail for prehistoric eggs trafficking and receiving and concealing monsters. Dimitri is still orbiting in the 9th extra-dimensionnal galaxy in a state of residual Karma. It's like a time-warp jump in the twilight zone. timings : meatisgood translation : aloysius70
