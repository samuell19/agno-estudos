Well then, Agnes... Why should we hire you? I have ten years' experience. I love the restaurant business, I'm passionate about every aspect... I really know how to make people comfortable... Even an idiot can be pleasant! At Bateau Bleu we require the attention. Perfect service means always being... ...one step ahead. I'm a fast learner. Dependable, thorough... I enjoy being part of a team. I think I got it from my mom, her cooking is the best! "La Cave", wine cellar. Bourgogne, Loire, Provence, Alsace, Bordeaux... Mise-en-place. Grill. Our sommelier, you know what that means, don't you? The man in charge of beverages. Or woman... Politically correct, how sweet. Garnier, Patisserie, wash section... Karl Reuterswärd, trained at the Cordon Bleu. And potatoes... My staff is like an army... An army that is to be victorious night after night. No mistakes. Tu comprends? Oui... Welcome to Le Bateau Bleu. But... I thought you were hiring waiting staff? Your lobster, sir. Enjoy. 2 foie gras, 2 filé mignons: One medium-rare, one well-done. - Well-done? Want that on a plank, too? - Hold it, no seafood sauce on that! Allergies, read the order. Agnes, come help me out. - I'm experimenting... - Did Gérard approve? Try this... A bit too tangy, add some arrowroot. - Are you kidding? - No, it's an old home cooking trick. What's this, herpes? Get out of my kitchen! Chérie! Table nine, top priority. - It's an important night. Lola is here. - Lola, the food critic? - I thought Lola was a woman. - A pseudonym, like all top critics. - "Red Scare", "Lola"... - Yes, but are you sure he's Lola? Do not insult me! I know everyone and was tipped off. "Anonymous"... Merci. - Take this. - Won't he be suspicious? - We won't be treating him to it. Not a Château Latour for 27,000 kronor! Walk past and make sure he sees it. And undo a few buttons, you look like ze nun. One more button. - Fluff them up! - What? Hi... What are you doing here? - I was fired! - Oh no... Please, Tobias, could you come home early tonight? We could cuddle and... Sorry, I can't. This is the deal... We... Me and Ida are... We're... Sorry... I'm really sorry. You weren't supposed to find out like this. You're always at work. I've tried to talk, but... Agnes, please! It's good that it's over, that jerk was a parasite! - This goes well with the bread. - Sit down and talk. Wouldn't that be nice? I'm sorry... I'm lost if I don't have someone to take care of. How about taking care of you for a change? I can't focus on anything else, everything reminds me of him! Oh, sweetheart! Tonight, it's you and me, okay? It's "girls' night". What about him? Or this guy? Oh, I think I've done him. - Hey, wasn't this "girls' night"? - Right... What about her? Just kidding! - Who are you talking to, honey? - Huh? - Should I call Tobbe? - No, that's not a good idea. - You don't think so? - I think we should find you a taxi. Thanks for your "support". Something's wrong with my key... Hang on, this is the wrong apartment. I'll give you a hand. It's you! I know who you are. What are you doing in my apartment? - What floor do you live on? - Oops. Sorry. What floor do you live on? - S-s-sird floor. - Third floor. Let me... I'll help you. I need this. There... Are you all right? Look... Hobbit feet! - Ouch! - Hey, fluffy... Cute... Need to put... Tobbe... snoring and... ...both of us. The kind of raspberries... Well, goodbye. See you around. Agnes... My little dove. Oh, Agnes! Come quench... ...my thirst for love! Oh, who are you? I promise to come around more often. - Who's this? - No idea, but she's pretty. - Looks like me. - I have the funniest parents on earth. "Love & Lemons" "Maud's Fish Surprise" There... It needs a splash of cream. About this much. The next step is crucial, you don't want it to curdle. Keep it at a slow simmer. Add some lemon. And don't stir it too slowly. - Fast? - No... Not too fast - just right. Like this. I did it like that, and it still curdled. Good thing you failed, or maybe you'd never come to see us. Yum! Smells delicious! As lovely as a burp from Jesus himself. Oh, Maud, is that your "Fish Surprise"? Agnes asked for it. Come here, I have something to show you. You don't need any film in your camera. You just scan it into the computer. No developing, just print! Here it comes. So fast, too. Amazing! That's our new camper. - What? You bought a camper? - 690,000 kronor. We put down a deposit. - Where did get the money? - We've been saving up for years. - Lived simply. - But that's going to change. You bet! We're going to Italy, to all those places we love. - And check out new ones. - Right? - You got it! Congratulations! At last, after dragging most of Italy home... Christ, this is heavenly! - Never tasted anything better. - This time, too? All right, all right... But it's terrific! Walnuts, hazelnuts... Basil. Dried, not fresh. Pecorino. Salt, obviously! One more ingredient. You'll never figure it out! Bitter orange! Every single time! 20 seconds. All yours. - Dad... - Thanks a lot! - Hello, Agnes speaking. - This is destiny calling. - Meet me at Nytorget tomorrow. - Who is this? At 2 pm. I brought pepper spray. Are you crazy? Agnes... - Hello! - Kalle? I'm Kalle. I'm Lussan. - Shall we... - What are you up to? That's what I want to show you. Come on! So there I was, making my umpteenth foie gras, when it hit me: "This isn't creative." So I quit! Cool, huh? Gérard was furious! No one's ever left him before. I told him I wanted to open my own place and now... ...I have found the perfect location. Welcome to "Reuterswärd"! - It's not quite ready. - You can say that again! - Sunshine there is my wife, Pernilla. - Hello... She's upset, the place needed more work than expected. The ventilation... The ventilation needed an upgrade and the plumbing... - But it's going to be great! - I'm sure it will be very nice. Listen, we want to go for quality. The best organic fair-trade ingredients... Innovative, lots of new textures. Mix it up, flavors from the far north, Italy, Asia... Classy, tasteful cross-over. - What do you think? - Great. Perfect. Agnes, I'd love for you to join us in this venture. You take care of the customers and I'll do the food - an unbeatable team! I'd love to work for you! When will you open? Right... Listen... It's like... Pernilla and I are pouring all our savings into this. Loaned money to the max. But we still need funds, so what we're looking for is... - A partner. - Exactly. Oh. - You want me to... - Invest, exactly. What? 100,000? 800,000. You've always wanted to have your own restaurant. - Not yet, though. - When? - Can you really grow lemons here? - Don't change the subject. - When would the time be right? - When things are more stable. When things are more stable you won't want to risk it, believe me. What bank would lend a sum like that to an unemployed... Not one! And that's why your father and I will lend it to you. What? You're going on that trip. You mean the world to us, and you have a shot at your dream. Of course we'll help you out. Our trip can wait. It's very nice of you, Mother. Only I'm not sure I'm ready. You can't always put your dreams on hold. You supported that jerk for years, and he did shit for you. Open a restaurant! Buy a hot dog meal and get a free record! At Tanko! Bon appétit, bitch. I'm in! Everything has to be perfect. I can't afford to fail. You're telling me? Listen, let's keep this under wraps for a while. - Your dad is eager to go on that trip. - He doesn't know? I'm trying to figure out the right way to say it. - Yeah, this one or that... - These look exactly the same. Do I get a say? This is for Kalle. Here are ours. - Turbot with buttery snow... - I like it! "Red Scare" put a crossover restaurant out of business all because the concept was "so 1999". Paolo, hey! - I told you we had another chef coming in, didn't I? Paolo, this is Agnes. - Agnes, this is Paolo. - How do you feel about crossover? - I like crossover. Fine restaurants don't advertise. We need write-ups from food bloggers, entertainment weeklies, critics... Like "Lola"? Lola or Red Scare. But you can't invite critics like that. - They're anonymous. - Lola lives in my building. - David Kummel. - Hang on... Lola's real name is David Kummel and he lives in your building? - Do you know him? - No... I've dropped by his place... Very casually. Then you do know him. Sort of. - Does he know what business you're in? - No. That's perfect! - And you want me to get him here? - Right... I'm not totally okay with that. This is a fine restaurant, we don't need to trick anyone into coming here, do we? - Point taken. Forget about it. - Kalle... - The restaurant will be a hit. - Yeah. Let's go! Everyone says it's fantastic! ...from Swedish cherry, very durable. We've put emphasis on the experience. Hi! Welcome. - Is Mom out parking? - She won't be coming. She wants you to get properly started before she... ...shares her opinions. You know what she's like. Here. From our lemon tree. Look at you, a maître-d' at last! These days, most people would settle for any job. Cheers! What a great opening night! I have multiple talents, so if you need a waitress... here I am! - Did you get fired? - No... I was sick of the real estate business anyway. - What did you do? - It was an office party. They were going to clean up regardless. Seriously, I'm great. Look, here's a plate... Like to have a taste? Be careful, it's very... hot! What do you say? I think I could pull it off. Paolo is gorgeous! But you can have him. - You should walk up to him and... - Stop it! Listen... Isn't it about time you got over the "guitar hero"? Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to him? Honey, when you say things like that... ...I want to slap you! Stop it! Get over him! Move on! Paolo, I keep telling Agnes she has to stop being such a brown doormat. - Something wrong with being brown? - No, it's just an expression. About taking crap... Without it showing... Because crap is the same... color as the brown... I've never seen her that quiet! - You live on the south side, don't you? - That's right. - Want to share a cab? - Sure. Where do you live? On the north side. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Sorry... - Did I do anything wrong? - No. I just... I feel like I'm cheating. Even though I'm not. I'm free, I can do whatever I like. Christ, I'm so sorry... I can't do this. Well, this is awkward... - So, I'll see you tomorrow at 4 pm. - Right. - Hi. - Hi. Kafka... sit! - We're going for a run by the waterfront. - Sounds nice. I've been... working. Take care... I'd like to say a few words. We are an army that should be victorious night after night. Every order is unique and every client is special. So... - Let's do this? - Let's do this! - Hello! - Can I park my bus out front? - I can help you park. - Oh, no. We're going to the theatre. I just need to know if I can park nearby. - Oh, sorry. I have no idea. - Thank you. A grand opening special might have been a good idea. Hand out flyers: "Get your steak and a large beer at bargain prices!" - We've got to do something. - What do you suggest? - I live upstairs. - That's right... - Not here, at least. - No... Though you might think so, I generally don't barge into other people's homes. I just wanted to thank you. What for? For not being angry with me. For letting me bother you. And just because you live here. Thank you... I'm afraid I'm out of coffee. I have coffee. Come on up. If you like... - Right now? - Yes, if you want to. - Sure, I'd love to. - Good... I just need to feed Kafka first. - Right, Kafka? So maybe you should... Right... See you in a while. Kafka, no... Sit! Hey, babe! - What brought you here? - Wanted to see how things were. Maybe pick up some stuff... Unless I'm interrupting something. Of course not. Come on in. Lemon pie! It's been ages. - May I have some? - Sure... I just need to do something... - Hi, I brought cream. - Listen... Something's come up. Maybe we can do this some other day. Hot damn, that's a good pie! The kickback on the commercial deal sucks big time. Sure, we get exposure, but we earn, like, nada. Workers at that hot-dog factory make more than us! Our manager doesn't do a damn thing. - We make art, not hot dogs! - I agree! - You get it! - You shouldn't be doing that stuff. You're so much better than that. You're so damn fine. Sweet Agnes... Too good for me. Mom will be happy when I tell her we're back together. "Together", what...? Does everything have to have a label?! Tobbe... That's not what I meant. If things are good, do you have to... No, sorry! I'm sorry. No! You can't be serious?! You screw up with Kummel and screw Tobias on the same day. - How is this even possible? - It didn't go according to plan. Hey... - Look who's here. Got to support your business... "Got to support your business"... - I didn't sound like that. - Yes, you did. - You can have him. - I'm trying to say this is a great place. Am I supposed to be the only paying guest? Doesn't make sense. Fix this, Agnes. - How are you? - Fine. And you? - I'm out for a run. - So am I. - Are you stuck? - What? No... - Yeah... - Let me help you. Hang on... You contact has migrated... Can't see it. But it's in there somewhere. Hang on! Hang on... Stop! come on. - Kafka! - Come here.. We've got to stop meeting like this. Right, and the other day got all weird, too. Tobias, my ex, suddenly showed up. - It was his favorite pie... - It looked delicious. Listen, there's this nice restaurant... Could I please treat you to dinner, to make up for this? I'm all dizzy after that shot. - I'll bring you some supper. - That won't be necessary. I've got loads of leftovers. We'll go out some other day. - What's for supper? - "Maud's Fish Surprise". - My mother's signature dish. - Exciting... My parents honeymooned in Europe. Every time she had something she liked, Mother asked for the recipe. This comes from a little trattoria in Sanremo. Where it's known as "Maud's Fish Surprise"? No, obviously it had some other name. - It's wonderful! - I know! Just impossible to make. It curdles. I bet Mom is keeping some ingredient secret, just to get me to visit more often. - Maybe it's love. - What? The secret ingredient, maybe it's love. Or maybe it's simply the combination of tomatoes, stock, cognac, cream and lemon. The right amounts and the right timing... It's not in the recipe, you need to just feel it. And I guess I'm not feeling it right. I once attended a seminar about French cuisine... ...where I heard about this chef named Paul-Henri Balaboud. Apparently, he was a genius. But he had one weak spot: Soufflés. Every single soufflé fell flat, like a pancake. The other chefs started calling him "Le Crêpe". - He was not amused. - What was the problem? Certain issues weighed him down. What do you mean? You're saying his feelings sort of materialized... ...and weighed down his soufflés? I figure it's like you and that soup. That maybe there are things in your life that don't work together. - I'm not actually tricking anyone. - No. If he likes our food, it's not my fault if he gives us a good review. You don't need to convince me, I'm in real estate. Or was. There is no such thing as being dishonest. You boost your odds. If he thinks he has a shot at sex, too, he'll only enjoy it more. - That's dishonest! - No, my dear - it's marketing. Hey, where are you going? - Kalle? - She has karate on Thursdays. - But David's coming! - But she has karate class. - This can't be happening... - Hi. We need a waitress, know anyone? - I'll check. - Me? That's how we met, after all. - That was 7 years ago, at Pasta King. - But I did wait tables. Enjoy... Welcome... I mean, hi! I just got here. - She can probably take your coat. - That she can. - How are you doing? - Fine. And you? - Hungry? - Yeah. Oh my... "Broiled scallops with a mango salsa and an emulsion of sorrel." I can recommend it. - I was here last weekend. - I see. How about some champagne? Party, party! May I ask... ...what kind of seaweed you use in the Seaweed Salad? It's... not the poisonous kind. It's the yummy kind. They're green... dark... black... - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here we go. - This is for you... - Enjoy. - Thank you. - It looks nice. - Yes, it does. - I have something to confess. - Okay. - Nice! - Thank you. The thing is, I'm a member of an online dating site. - And I've been emailing this girl. - There's someone you...? But I told her I was going to see you. So she knows. We're off. She and I are off. So because of this, you...? I just wanted to be up-front. I've been let down myself. Makes it hard to take the leap. - So I wanted to be honest. - Good. That's the way to go. Excuse me... - I can't do this. I can't lie! - Come on! - Wait a sec... - I don't want to lie. You said it yourself, your food deserves a good review. - Think of us! - And your parents! They sank their life savings into this. Goodbye... Nice. - Did you like it? - It was very nice. - Would you consider coming back? - Well, yes... - Let's have the check, please. - Sure. So a single bottle of milk from another farm would disqualify it? It's either "fermier" or not. You're a cheese Nazi. Maybe I am. - Your most embarrassing food? - Canned cassoulet. I can't believe I admitted that... Never told a soul before. Here am I, baring my soul. Your turn. - Don't get upset... - It's not fish fingers, is it? No... Hi, Dad. You're up late. Mom? Hello, sweetie. - How's the restaurant doing? - You're hopeless! - How long have you been ill?! - Just a few months. I thought it was just a circulation problem. Well, now you're here and they'll take good care of you. Imagine if you were on your trip! Fallen ill on some highway in Europe. Maybe this was a stroke of good luck after all? You'll go on that trip, I promise. "UNPAID" Put up your hair, that's unhygienic. We're an army. We need to be perfect! - How are you doing? - We've got to fix this mess! When Mom gets well, she has to go on her trip. It can't wait. At least I didn't drag him here this time. - He came on his own. - You didn't do anything wrong. Just stay out of sight and let the food do the work. This is the dining area. Not quite what I pictured, It's not really my style either... But Kalle and Pernilla know what's in. You need to listen to others, too. Hello, Maud. It's benign! It won't spread. - I told you so! - Get better... Then we'll go on our trip. - You can't go now! - We'll wait... a few months. Reuterswärd, review, lola - no results - Nothing? How are we doing, Kalle? We're losing 30,000... a week. We need to turn the tide. - What do you say? It's on me. - What the hell... - Christ! - I'm waiting endlessly Agnes... Will you go out... with me? Hey, shortie... I'm going to this sponsor dinner... with the commercial people. Want to join me? If you're not too busy. - I don't know... - Don't make me go all alone. - I have a restaurant, "Reuterswärd". - How exciting. - How do you like this food? - Well, in my opinion... ...the vegetables are perfect, but I would have balanced the flavors. Maybe with lime or clarified butter. Wonder why they didn't think of that? Well, look who's here? Agnes Edin... I've heard about your project with Karl. - Place packed every night? - Bring in another round of beer. I'll send over a waitress. And some ketchup, too! I told you to never show your face here again. You think you know about food. You weren't even born when I came to this gastronomically challenged land. Maybe that's the problem. You've been at it too long. Lost your taste. The trout had no flavor. But I wrote down a few pointers. I'll give them to you. Here! This is awkward... Guess I double-booked. But you'd already finished your meal. Isn't that right? Agnes? I haven't seen you for a while. How are you? Personally, I'd go as far as saying guitar guys are the root of all evil. War, weapons of mass destruction, starvation... But maybe I'm bitter, I tried to play piano and never got further than "Little Snail". Ever noticed how Ulf Lundell's gaze is so intense? I never liked that picture... Tobbe picked it out. - Maybe it's time he was history? - Yeah, I know. Everyone keeps telling me he's only using me. Well, I don't know Ulf personally... I thought you... You're right. Uffe needs to go. Let me give you a hand. - Hang on... - It's really heavy! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. There... Stay put! I'm through with you. Thank you. Was that the newspaper? We really need to get some sleep. "Little snail, watch your step..." - What are you doing? - Singing a lullaby. I'll be quiet. I will... Impossible! - Hi. How are you? - I'm actually... great! - So you haven't seen the review? - No. What? No Personality Well, it does say... the food is high quality. Hardly matters when you read it all. "The self-consciously trendy room is as empty as a mausoleum. Possibly due the pretentious menu and the outrageous prices. The only genuine note was the truly ignorant waitress"... - That's enough! - I don't care about the waitress part. It's just so unfair to you. Suffering that weirdo's company just to get a good review! Good thing you didn't sleep with him. Oh... Speak of the devil... Bye. Is this... what you really think? I'm always honest. Maybe you should try it sometime? David, I never meant to deceive you... This sure looks nice... But you can go pretty far to get a good review, right? - David... - Don't! Please? Boy, have I missed my kitchen! Have you told Dad about the money? One thing at a time. I'm sorry it was such a failure... It's like that old joke: "Don't worry, things can only get worse." It's not like anybody died! Nobody knows the outcome in advance. You just do your best, that's all you can do. Now chop some parsley! Mom? Talk to me! What's going on?! Hello... Mom?! DAD?! Call emergency services! - Look at me, Mom! - We need an ambulance... - No pulse! - Mommy! Listen, the ambulance is on its way. Do something, Daddy! Italy has always been special to us. Ever since we... ...were there on our honeymoon. And here's something Maud wrote on that trip... "Ran out of gas on the highway. The room was double-booked. Our money is running out. We both have a cold and are running a temperature. Life is wonderful!" That's what it was like to be with Maud. No matter what happened... ...life was wonderful. I'll finish off with a poem by Birger Sjöberg: "I long for Italy, to see that beautiful place Where love and lemons grow with patient grace Where nightingales sing and through the night bring Rosy shells a gleaming..." I'm going on that trip... Buying the camper. - And going, just like we planned. - All by yourself? It will help me hold on to her a little bit longer. I think she would like that, don't you? Dad... I don't know how to put this, but you can't go... The money's all gone. And... ...if it's any consolation, you own part of a restaurant. I'm sorry... That's the way it is... Is there any way to get my dad's money back? Right now, everything we've invested is gone. Plus 400,000 more. Well, we have way too much equipment. What if we sell some of it? Agnes, it's impossible. The money is gone. Tell her. Someone's made us an offer... Gérard. Gérard? Why? He wants a ping-pong room? How would I know! It's not a great offer, but we would only lose our investment. We'd lose everything we invested? We won't have to file for bankruptcy. We can regroup. In 10 or 15 years we'll have paid off all our debt. And can start over. This is painful for me too. But we have to be realistic. I think we should accept his offer. Right... I hope they'll finish up soon, so we can get started. I can't make my mind up, should I call it "Petit Bateau Bleu" or "Petit Bleu"? What do you think, chérie? - I haven't signed the papers yet. - That's all right. I'll just wait until you go bankrupt and buy it even cheaper. Dad... Your mother wanted you to have this. Pass me the custard... Thanks. I asked you to come to the funeral. I know, but I was in a bind. We had this important rehearsal... I'm sorry, Agnes, really sorry. But I'm here now. And I brought you something. Check out my jacket. Something to cheer you up. - You mean this? - You don't have it already, do you? No, but... ...in what way do you imagine this would cheer me up? I don't like Ulf Lundell. - You don't? Sure you do... - No, YOU like him. You've never bothered to find out, but I hate Ulf Lundell! Hate? You can't hate Uffe, he's a genius. I don't think so! What do you mean? It's a fact. I want Uffe out of my life! That goes for you, too! You're fucking crazy! Agnes! It's... Uffe! What are you staring at? Agnes! God damn it! - Are you keeping the sign? - As a memento. We need to talk. I figured out where we went wrong. - What's wrong? - Nothing. But we need to talk. Listen, our concept didn't work. - You don't say! - We spent 100,000 on light fixtures. We should have kept our prices down so people could afford to dine here. I don't want to impress other restaurateurs. I want to have a place people go to to enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Now I know what we should do. This... - "Love & Lemons"? - That's right. I'm sure this is great... but it's too late. We'll be declared bankrupt in 2 weeks. We'd lose everything, even our homes. - We have two weeks. - Two weeks to develop a new concept? To get the word out and to turn a profit? That's exactly what I mean. I'm... in. So is Kalle. - Let's do it. - Yes, let's do it! Finally, some balls! - Not that you don't have any, but... Let's do it! Agnes, look... - What do you think? - Beautiful! - "Sunny Chicken"? - It's delicious. It would be perfect with your special cheese grissini. Let's go for it. Wait... - What about "Maud's Fish Surprise"? - It's great, but only Mom can make it. - Just follow the recipe. - No, not that dish. - What do you think? - It's nice. Very nice. A little too bare, though. I sold the house. I can't spend the rest of my days being reminded that Maud isn't there. Here, come and see us at "Love & Lemons". Hi... I wanted you to have this. It's a whole different concept, simpler and homier. We open on Saturday. "Love & Lemons"? Please come, I'd really like that. I'm not allowed to review the same place twice. That's not what I meant. I'd be delighted to have you there as a guest. I... don't expect you to forgive me. But I want you to know that I am so very sorry for what I did. It does sound nice... I'll check with Camilla. Oh... Right! You do that. The online dating girl... Obviously, both of you are very welcome. Bye! Right... Let's see. - Here, this is for you. - Agnes, don't forget to eat. I can't, I'm too nervous. - What about you? - This is my lunch. I want to thank you all for your efforts. You all worked so hard, around the clock. Without pay. To make my dream come true. I once described us as an army, but I was totally wrong. We're not an army. We're family. - Kalle! - Well, the last bit was kind of cheesy... - Maybe it's something he ate? - We all had the same... Go outside, Pernilla! Don't touch a thing! Paolo... How are you doing? Told you wine was better. - What are we going to do? - We have to close. But we've advertised. Made those special offers... We've got to... stay open. Okay... I'll find a chef. Hey, YOU can cook. You know the menu better than anyone. Listen, you can do this. You're the strongest person I know. - What? - Okay, maybe not the strongest... But let's do this, Agnes! Together we can pull it off. - It's "bruschetta". - All right, "bruschetta". "Stockholm Bisque", "Eggplant Pesto"... "Filled Parma Bundles"... Right! Where do I start? There, now all we do is wait... If we're lucky, no one will show up. I'll be in the kitchen. - Sorry, I can't help you with the parking. - Don't worry, we're all set. Are you open? Chop tomatoes! Two "Sunny Chickens". Right. Two more... Yes... - Something wrong? - Feels like cooking with Mom. You're great! I'll be right with you. - May I have a menu? - Sure! Sorry to keep you waiting, I'll be right back. Hello! Agnes gave us this flyer. Great, find yourself a seat if you dare! Just kidding! - Here... - What's this? You don't know? It's a "sgroppino", a cocktail originated in Venice. A fine mixture of Prosecco, vodka, lemon peel and lemon sorbet. Our very own sorbet, of course. Made by tonight's chef... ...Agnes. Thank you. - No, thank you. - It's included in tonight's special. No, thank you. Is she pretty? Average... One "Stockholm Bisque". Dad, keep an eye on the chicken. Hi! I'm so glad you came! Both of you. - The place looks great. - Thank you. Camilla - Agnes. - What do you call this concept? - It's not really a concept... I just added my mother, that's all... Things are a bit crazy tonight. - Shall I give you more time? - No, I'll have bruschetta for starters. I'll have the rocket salad, but skip the oil and the Parmesan. - Do you put anything else on it? - Balsamico... - Skip that, too. - All right. Sure. I don't eat regular food after 4 pm. Just protein. - So you don't want the entrée, either? - No. I have digestion issues. So I need to maintain a strict routine. We're supposed to be honest, right? Well, would you like that on a plate? - Sure. - Thank you. So... "I'm Camilla, and I'll be having such a festive meal tonight!" "Now isn't that special?" Here... Enjoy! There's goo all over it! We don't have any Château Latour, do we? No, who's asking? Hope you enjoyed the bisque. Mediocre. Anything else? I'll bring you your check. Thank you for dining with us. Recommend us to your friends... If you have any. - Hello, I'm Sven, Agnes' father. - Christ, amateurs! I had expected more from Karl. - Where is he? - He's ill. - So who's cooking? - Me. You liked my food, even cleaned your plate. The presentation is laughable! Are you serving her that? "Red Scare"... Didn't you know she was here? - Over there, she's "Red Scare". - What is it with the stupid names? Listen to me! Everyone quotes her reviews; the daily papers, TV shows, everyone! If she doesn't like us, we're toast. - What did she order? - She ordered the... Oops! Here it is! Right... The "Antipasto Sanremo" followed by the "Stockholm Bisque". I'm 100% certain. Go cook! ...loads of programming languages and systems: Gemini, PL1, C++, Linux... My job is to make all these work together. I like to joke that I'm the "spider in the world-wide web". The guys at work laughed. Your chicken. The table over there. The woman ordered the one without peppers. I don't know who ordered what anymore! I'm all mixed up! I need a vacation. Calm down. Take this to Red Scare. Let me know when she's finished about a third, I need to time the soup. - I can't deal with this! - I'll give you a hand. Welcome... We bought this at the fish market... Think the chef could whip up something tasty with it? It's hake, I think. What are you doing?! - How could he pee in my bisque?! - Absolutely disgusting! - Could you make a fresh pot? - It takes 30 minutes. Go see if she wants some more wine. - That's it, "game over". - No. We can't keep Red Scare waiting. And what am I supposed to do with that bloody fish?! - It's hake ("kummel"). That's what it is. - I'm Kummel, David Kummel. She doesn't want any wine, so what do I do now? Anything! Yodel, do a strip tease... - I was joking! - Good thing you told me that. We'll figure it out. When you taste something extraordinary, you forget about the long wait. Make "Maud's Fish Surprise". - I can't... - Of course you can. You can do it. I'll go out and stall her. - Buon giorno. - Buonasera. Oh that's right: Buonasera. I'm Agnes' father. - Who is Agnes? - She's our chef tonight. - Two chefs in the family? - No, I sell air filters. - Air filters? - Yes, to protect... Industrial use. In cars. For people, I guess. You put them in frames... Metal frames. Or wooden, if you want to go green. It's... How's it going? - No pressure, but... - Not now! Yes! That's lovely, but our guests are waiting. Quick, a bowl! Wait! I'm really sorry about this... But you have to taste this. Is that the "Stockholm Bisque"? This is even better. - Che buona! - Si, buonissima! - Perfetta! - É una delicatezza... Enjoy... Oh shit! This is sick! It's so awesome! Literally turns me on! Thank you. For everything. Thanks... Right, we need... to get going. - It's late. - I understand. See you around. David... You were right. About the secret ingredient. You know what, David... We've been chatting online for months about honesty. Why don't you go and tell her how you feel? But... Will you be all right? Actually, I think you're boring. Wow, I feel the same way. Honestly... So... - Good luck. - You too. - Bye! - Bye. Thank you. Get out, I need to pee! Did you leave something behind? I... "Love & Lemons" serves solid yet inspired Mediterranean cuisine. Cozy atmosphere and eccentric staff, it will surely become a classic eatery. What a terrific review! - "Eccentric staff"... That's me, right? - Of course it is! - Incoming! - Right, get to work! Work? Right now? Hello, welcome!
