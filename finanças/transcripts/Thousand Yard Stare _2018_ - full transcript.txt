Okay, so, it's a modern girl - cursed by an ancient legend. - Lieutenant Pine? The legend of the cat people. Yeah, it sounds pretty sexy. Definitely. Bastard. No, never mind. - There a problem Inglis? - Lemme see. - Yeah. I keep sendin' 'em my stories and they haven't published any of 'em yet. The Dawn of the Days of Glory. The Great War, As Fought by Jack Inglis. Hmm, January 17th, 1943. It was a cold night on the front lines. There was a soft breeze in the air, wafting the scent of the enemy towards us. Guys... We could hear the artillery fire echoing beyond the horizon. - It rattled our bones. - Dear Roland, How can words describe how much I love you? Well, come a little closer. Let me whisper in your darling ears all these loving words, because they're meant for you. You are the world. You are everything. But part of me is missing. - And that part is you. - Sleep is a dream. Reality, - a nightmare. - A nightmare. It's a nightmare, Jack! No matter what, no matter how long you're gone for, whether it's weeks or months or all of forever, I will always be yours, as you are mine. From now to the end of time. I love you, and only you, for always. Keep this letter close and dream of me often, as I dream of you. Be safe, my love. - For I am a soldier afterall, Forever yours, Barbara. - An American soldier, prepared by the best to fight and die for my country. Aw, come on, what's the big deal? You know We would have read it if it got published anyways, right? I didn't send this one in yet. I don't like it when people read my stuff before it's finished. It's good. What it was good? - First squad, listen up. - Atten-hut! Kraut armor has broken through the lines at Sidi Bouzid. Battalion's reporting heavy casualties to the 36th infantry and 1st armor. The 26th RCT is falling back to Kasserine. We'll reinforce the line and wait there for further orders. Okay, everyone, pack up. Full gear, we're not comin' back here. Any questions? Good, 30 minutes at the rally point. Happy Valentine's Day. Say goodbye to your father, James. Be good for your Mother, all right? Okay. Okay, well, we're going then. I love you. Johnson, where are we at with the extra ammo? I gotta check check back at CP, we got nothin'. Well hurry up. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - I love you too. - Oh, Fuck your mother. - Don't hurt yourself there. - Kit issues? - No, it's not bad enough I got to take take a shit every five minutes from these goddamn rations, but I gotta fuck around with this junk now. Come here. Ah, you're all tangled up. What the hell's all this shit for anyway? Since we're not gonna see any action. - Lookin' good, soldier. - Yeah? Like the belle of the ball. Thanks, Sergeant, I'll probably be back. Goddammit! Don't move! Are you alone? Don't move. Is there anyone else here with you? I said don't move! Halt! A minute 23 left in the penalty to Bentley. Montreal crosses center ice and Toe Blake brings the puck up to the Chicago line. Can't get it past, Toomer pokes it off his stick. Puck takes a strange bounce, goes down the left side, it's picked up by Reg Hamilton, but he loses control and can't get it up. Blake does a fine job tying the Chicago defender - up along the boards. - James, bedtime. But the game's not over yet. It's getting late and you have school in the morning. Say goodnight to your father, and let's go. And dumps the puck into the Montreal end after being carried by Bouchard Sweet dreams. Time, get set up. And with a minute left in the penalty, the Canadians, stick handling neatly, get it over the line. Bouchard gets a big pass from Blake. He sends the shot away, and the puck goes into the corner. Bouchard pinches in, gets the stick on it, fires it back down into the corner. Blake's the first on it. He stops, looks, and passes to Medea in the slot. It's intercepted by Colleta but he's tied up by. Hamilton tries to help 'em out, Pallas, but before he can clear Blake keeps it in. and defense lining up against. You will take the extra... Incoming! Take cover! Move, move, move! Rothach, Rothach! Machine gun squad, 10 o'clock! I need you and your squad on me. First Squad, on me! Get the lead out. Go, go, go, go. Stay down, we're gonna get you to safety! Fire team, get ready to support our movement. - Go! - Fisher, Painter, up! Lieutenant! Open fire! Shit! Fall back, everyone, fall back, on me! Go, go, go, go! water. Huh? Huh? Suppressing fire! Almost out! Sarge, we're almost out, we... Medic, Medic! Here they come! Grenade! Nice throw, Sarge. Rothach, where's Lambert? Dead, we have to fall back and consolidate. We were able to push them back, but those Panzers are coming in quick. They're gonna break through. Reinforcements are inbound, armor and tank destroyers. You hold this position. - Where's Captain Farley? - I have no idea! You guys stay right here until I figure out what's going on. What are we doin', Sarge? You just keep your eye on the sector. - We have to hold the line! - Come on! And then he tells me in French, that he wants to give me a kiss, 'whoa, easy'. So anyway, I uh, I finally made it back and everything turned out better than expected. This is really great, Barbara, you've outdone yourself. Hell, every time Shirley makes a roast it comes out like an old shoe. I have to get the recipe for these potatoes. Do you still have the victory garden in the backyard? Absolutely, this year's harvest was magnificent. Hmm, I can imagine. Bill, we should give them some of our raspberry jam. Definitely, more than we'll ever be able to use. So, Roland, how are you adjusting to life back home? - Settlin' in all right? - He's doing just fine. Got him a job workin' with me, good hard labor. If the war didn't do it, we'll make a man out of him yet. Not as much adventure as you're used to though, I imagine. No, not so much. Not as many Krauts, eh Roly? - Not quite. - There's always a spot for you back at the paper. - Great. - You know, when you're ready. It must be nice though, to be back home? Hard, I imagine. How do you cope after witnessing all that needless death and destruction? You fellas must've seen so much. Oh, I don't know if I'd say needless. Jesus, Pearl Harbor, Billy. Well, It just seemed there was a lot of waste in terms of innocent lives. Not to mention the toll it took on foreign infrastructure and economy. I mean, they're still eating their horses in Amsterdam. Oh, sunshine and rainbows and ponies for all. They started the fight, we ended it. There's gonna be some bloody noses. But look at our economy here at home, it's booming. Nobody could have predicted that 10 years ago. We defended our way of life, - and were rewarded for it. - Can we go play? - Sure honey. - Yeah, can we, Mom? Did you finish your dinner? - Yeah. - Okay, go ahead. It was our responsibility to throw our helmets into the ring, so to speak. Then why didn't we take action - until after Pearl Harbor? - Sorry, where did you fight? Well, I signed up, but they deemed me unfit for military service due to an inner ear problem. Inner ear problem? - What the fuck is that? - Roger, language. It affects my balance. He can hardly walk some days. I think that what Bill's trying to say is that we could have taken a more humanitarian role in dealing with the civilian population. We'll ask women about war if one ever breaks out in the kitchen. We're deviating from the point. Trudy used to work at one of the factories - that made the bullets. - Oh, I agree. The point is, if it wasn't for Marines like myself out there burnin' those sneaky slant-eyes out of holes day and night, I guarantee there'd be moldy rice on this table, not a goddamn roast dinner, Semper Fi! You realize the war wasn't just fought on a handful of islands in the Pacific. The Pacific was our war. - Europe was a picnic compared to the hell we endured. - Picnic... We just bailed them out of a tough situation. If boots on the ground were so important in the Pacific, then why did it take two atomic bombs before they surrendered? And we don't agree with the bomb, do we Bill? Of course not. So many innocent lives lost, and for what gain? For what gain? Are you out of your fuckin' mind? - Roger! - I'll tell you for what gain. Have you ever looked one of these greasy Nips in the eye? Roland, what do you think about all this? Now what? Oh my God, what happened? - Toby bit me. - Let me see. - I'll go get you a cloth. - Call Dr. Brown. It could be infected, what if she has rabies? Look at what your vicious mutt did! I'm so sorry, usually he's so friendly. So, what, you're saying this is Liz's fault? - She's six. - Dogs like that should be locked up in a cage. You're right, I'm sorry, is there anything I can do? We're leaving. Christ! Keep firing! Rothach! Rothach, where's Lieutenant Lambert? - Dead, sir. - Shit! What about Pyne? He was looking for you, sir, I think he's in the 1st platoon. I just came from there, 1st platoon's been overrun. What are your orders, sir? Sir! I've gotta go find Pyne. Here they come! Oh, goddammit, all right. First squad, fall back to that position. Inglis, check that .30 cal, make sure it's still workin'. Second squad, provide suppressing fire. Then we'll cover you. - Fields! - Yes, Sarge? Can Austin move, we gotta go right now! I can't make it, Sarge. Let's move, we gotta pull out right now! All right, let's do it! Let's go! Come on,. Let's go, let's go. Come on now, go, go go. Come to me. Where are you? Bill Baker, please. Bill? It's Roland. Yes, hello. How are you? Oh, good, that's good to hear. I'm okay, I've been, uh, writing a book. Hello? Hello? Sorry. I just wanted to call. I mean, I just wanted to see how you were. That's good. I got my job back at the paper. Yeah, I talked to Bill. I was gonna see if maybe I could see you. I just have some things I wanted to say. I just wanted to say some things that you should hear. I'd really like to see you. And James, too, of course. Downtown, on Monday? Grant Park, all right. Great. I'll see you then. All right, second squad, fall back! Covering fire! Aw, fuck it. - This is FUBAR. - I know, what do you need? Charlie Company has fallen back it back to CP. Farley took off towards first platoon. I gotta get a radio. You think you can hold on till I get back? We'll give it our best shot. I'm counting on you. Medic! Oh God! Medic! Oh, God. - Patch me up! - Medic! Roly? Roly they're coming! Fuck, fuck! I'm tryin'! Fuck, fucking cocksucker, patch me up! Calm down. Doc, can you, I need my gun! They're coming! Fuck, you I'm dying! They're coming, they're coming! Oh no, oh my God! - I don't wanna die! - Hold on, hold on, Hendricks! - They're coming! - Stop you're overexerting and that's just gonna make you- Roly, Roly, fuck! - It's okay! - Roly, Roly! - Roly. - Help. Help, help. Coming to you over WAAF, operating on 1120 kilocycles, 267 meters, as authorized by the Federal Radio Commission. And now the program continues with Mr. Scott and Mr. Greenfield Roly? What are you doing? How was your day? James'll be home soon. Roland! What are you doing, stop, Roland! Stop it! Get off of me, Roland Stop it, don't! Get off me, stop it! I'm home! Soldier, get battalion on the horn! Danger Forward, this is Danger Red Dog Two, over. Danger Forward, come in please, over. Fuck. Second platoon, fall back on me! Move, move, move! Oh, no. Come on. I want you to be the man I fell in love with. I want James to have a father. You wanna see what I am? What are you doing? You wanna see what I've become? - Roland, stop it! - I'm nothing! I'm nothing! What are doing? No, no, no! Shit. - Sarge, what are we doin'? - Can anyone get Austin? Where the hell is everybody? - Get Austin, - I can't get to him! - Fischer, get out there - Get rid of it! Hey, halt! Fall back! Everyone fall back to the CP! Hey, fucking come back! Don't fucking leave! Don't- Halt! - Stop! - No! Shut up! They're coming. Sh, they're coming, sh, quiet, quiet. Godammit They're coming. They're coming, sh, sh, sh. Don't shoot, I'm an American! I'm an American, don't shoot! American. I'm comin'. Morning, Mr. Rothach, how are you today, sir? You okay, sir? Hello? Hello?
