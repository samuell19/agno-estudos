[man 2 replies, indistinct] [happy instrumental music playing] [engine sputtering] [engine revving] What's the point of a discovery flight if you can't even enjoy your first time flying an airplane? So they'll know where to discover our bodies. You're doing fine, Doug. Bring her down easy and nail your first landing. Or the last. [man, over radio] Cessna 898, you are clear to land. Cessna 898, are you okay? You're looking a little wonky. Have the emergency vehicles standing by. Uh… Uh… [engine revving] - Ooh! - Ugh! Oh! - You got it. You got it. - I got it. I got it. - Okay. - We'll try it again. I am so gonna fight you if we survive this. [engine revving] Jeff, will you just stop yapping and relax? I'm trying to focus. How am I supposed to relax? I'm sitting in my lunch. - Try it one more time. I got it. - Okay. Ninth time's the charm. [Chuckles] What am I doing wrong? Flying. That's what you're doing wrong. Listen, just think of it as you hit your first home run or the first time on a bike. Just... [stammers] You just gotta believe you can... [Jeff retching] Naples Tower, Cessna 898, we'll try it again. - [man] Copy, 898. - I got the airplane? Keep your eyes down the runway next time. You've got the airplane. It's like I'm driving a car. Flaps, you got that? - All right. Drop your flaps. - [Rick] Perfect. [whirring] This yoke, it's really heavy to hold this thing up. [Rick] Use your trim wheel there. Give it a few turns down. [Jeff yells] - We're stalling! - Take it. Take it. Take it. [Rick] Right, okay. I have the airplane. Good job. Good job. Way to go. [Jeff] Mission accomplished. What do you say, Dougie? Why don't we just go out and get you a new hobby, huh? Get yourself an aviation radio to listen to the radio traffic control in your spare time. Yeah. Or listen to me and go bowling. Now, I mean this outta love. [exhales] What's that? Take up pottery. Because you really suck at flying. Well, you really suck at running. - Oh, yeah? Prove it. - Yeah. On your mark, get set… Hey! You always cheat! - You always lose! - Wait! - Come on. You can't… - Loser. - No, come on. I got you. I'm coming. - Loser.

Your grill temperature's getting a little high. Oh, shoot. - You go get 'em, 'cause we don't lose. - All right. I will. You crutch this brisket? Yes, sir. We did. And whose idea was that? Well, it's not really an idea. It's more of a philosophy. [Jeff] Yeah. You do this for a living? - [both chuckle] - No. I am your local pharmacist. And love barbecuing. It's one of my many hobbies. I tell you what. This hobby has just won you a barbecue contest. [all cheering and applauding] [Terri] We did it! Oh! [Jeff exclaiming excitedly] - Oh, hey. Thank you. - Thank you very much. Thanks. [both whooping] That brisket was perfect. This rib sauce is the best I ever had. I told y'all, we don't lose! Get off the stage. - Get down. - That's rude. Excuse my daughter. Rumor has it that you boys barbecued a whole lotta ribs and it wasn't part of the competition. Well, uh, like our daddy always said, "When the fire's hot, don't waste the log." "And when you cooking ribs, might as well feed 'em all." So, we now gonna be feeding the masses. [Doug] Big Moe, thank you. Thank you.

What makes you think that? - [chuckles] - The time I drove the truck into the lake, or was it me drinking a beer while the truck was in the lake? No. It was that nine-pound bass you pulled from the lake when the tow truck yanked you out. [Chuckles] That was a good fish. Remember what Dad said? Oh, yeah. "Dougie, you want the strap or the switch?" "It's gonna hurt me a lot more than it's gonna hurt you." [both, chuckling] That was a lie. [vehicle approaching] [Jeff laughing] "…ever had."

I got your alley-oop. - Hey, girl. - She must play for the other team. - Thanks for helping out. - There you go. [Terri] Maggie. Are you all right? Great, Mom. I love feeding homeless people, cleaning up their mess when I could be home doing what I wanna do. - Which is what? - Anything but that. All right, young lady. We are spending quality family time together helping people who don't have what we got. You need a better perspective. Spend the night out there. [scoffs] What, outside in the park? Mom. Be grateful for what you got before it's gone. And the next time I throw you an alley-oop you better toss it on home. You hear me? I don't even know what that is. The answer is, "Yes, ma'am." Say it.

I don't know, but, uh… Should I try to level off? You think autopilot is on? - There's a button there. It says "A-P." - My wife found a switch. Uh, I believe it's the autopilot.

He's gonna keep climbing, might get too high, run out of oxygen. They gotta level him out. Here. You can use this laptop to track the plane. The tail number is N-5-5-9-D-W, but they'll say Niner-Delta-Whiskey. That's how you know it's this plane. What? Why? They talk fast. Use less words. They're talking to thousands of planes. Okay, this is... This is crazy. How do you know this? I'm gonna be a pilot one day. Okay, why? Because one time after science class, Mr. Jones told me I couldn't. Listen, I already busted 10,000. I am steady climbing. I need to stop this climb. I need help. If we turn the autopilot off, that might stop the climb? Miami, are you with me? Miami, are you still with me? Okay. November-Five-Five- Niner-Delta-Whiskey, when you look at the center console there, you don't see "autopilot"? [Doug] The switch in the middle of the panel is on. Do you want me to turn it off? November-Five-Delta-Whiskey, that's fine. Disengage the autopilot. We're gonna have you hand-fly the plane. Okay. Hold the yoke level, and disengage the autopilot.

Have you ever piloted a plane before, sir? One discovery flight. Ma'am, you find me the longest and the widest runway you can. He won't make it. The difference in this plane and a Cessna is night and day. - Lisa, we have to... - It's a suicide mission. That may be the case, but we gotta try. Is there anything I can do to help? Bow your head. Put your hands on the instrument panel. - Dear Lord, please send us some angels. - No. That's not for praying. Terri, that's the impact position. - It'll come to that? - Be ready. - Stay positive! - Miami, you gotta stay with me. My wife and daughters are on this plane. We need help. Hold the plane level. You are doing pretty good. 17,000. Just try to keep the plane level at 17,000. I just started speaking Air Traffic Control just a few days ago so if you could just speak a little slower, and in English Roger that. I mean, sure thing. Fly the plane straight at 17,000 feet. Now, that I can do. Move these planes out of his way. I need it clear. Circus 86, contact Miami Approach, 133.17. [pilot] Circus 86, copy. [Lisa] Okay, November-Five-Delta-Whiskey, just start a slow, shallow descent. Just ease down on the yoke. Slight descent. We're gonna go to 11,000. Pull back on the throttle slightly, and just ease over the yoke. Gently. We're gonna try a nice, shallow, 500-feet-per-minute descent. One moment. Those are the same two levers to the left? - [Lisa] Yes. - All right. All right. Pull it back. Okay, there. It's going down. [keyboard clacking] He's supposed to be flying a straight line. He's going up and down, left and right. So, is he going down? Look at all the planes moving out of his way. He might actually die. This is, like, so bad. [Lisa] November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey, so you know what we're doing, we're gonna get you down to 11,000, give you a turn to the west. That's 11,000 feet, I reckon, ma'am. Right? Yes, sir. That's correct. Sorry about the jargon. Second nature for me. This is my first rodeo, ma'am, so if you're losing me, I'm gonna let you know. Roger that. [Ellis] Lisa. All right. Bring her to 132.07… We're gonna hand you off to Fort Myers Approach. They got controllers with pilot experience and they're gonna take their time and talk you all the way into the landing there. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You're gonna hand me off to someone else? [Lisa] That's affirmative. You'll be crossing into their airspace. These are good people. We've got you, okay? I understand this can be stressful, but we're here for you. We see everything in your path much further than you can imagine. All you gotta do is just keep on flying the plane perfectly like you're doing right now. - We'll get you through this. - [Bailey] What are they saying? - Can you hear them? - Well… You're all we've got. So, roger. Niner-Delta-Whiskey. Doug, I'm looking for the emergency procedures. No doubt we're gonna need them. Has anyone seen Brian? A plane took off from Marco Island. Dead pilot on board. - You're kidding. - They're sending him here. Have you ever flown a King Air? Anyone have hours in a King Air? Brian's shift just got over. You might catch him in the parking lot. - I... I might be able to make a phone call. - I've got it. Uh, no, I've never had a Spam and broccoli casserole. [Chuckling] But, well, I'm sure it's gonna be fine. I'll be happy to make my special corn bread. Hey! Brian! Wait! Brian! - [brakes screech] - [Ralph grunts] What? [Ralph groans] Ralph. What are you doing? We got… We got an emergency inside. We need you. Come on. - Let me move my truck. - Go. They're bringing him here to Fort Myers. They're bringing him here! Oh, whoa. Aren't we, like, pretty close to the airport? [airplane passing overhead] Too close. They'll probably turn him out west. Over the ocean. [Buggy] Why? I saw this in an airplane documentary. If he drops, he won't kill anybody. Except the people on the plane. [engine sputtering] Come on. [Brian] All right, what do we got? Do you need me to redirect or anything? [cell phone vibrating] Well, well, my man, Dan. What's going on, brother? Kari, listen. I need your help. I'm at work. I'm in the control room at Fort Myers. There's a guy flying a plane. You're calling me from the control room on a cell phone? Yeah. [sighs] Okay. Kari? [cell phone vibrating] Hello. Hey, Dan. Yeah, he's right here. He's all yours. - I forgot my keys. - Can't talk to him right now. Seems he doesn't wanna communicate with you either. Take it. Have you lost your mind, or trying to get me arrested? Kari, listen. I'm at work. I need your help. I'm in the control room, and there's a guy... It's illegal to use a cell phone in there. - Listen! - If I'm on that call I need you to stop a plane crash. - What? - There's a plane to Fort Myers. Pilot's dead, passenger's flying but no one here has hours in that type of aircraft. What's going on? [Dan] Kari, we need your help. There's a family on board. I'm sure right about now they're scared senseless. Kari, we need you, buddy. Look… [stammers] …I don't know if I can do this. You hear me? You're the only one who can save them. I need the tail number. Get me next to the controller talking to the guy flying the plane. - Does he have flight experience? - A couple hours in a Cessna. [keyboard clacking] [Ashley] Kari, what's going on? [laptop beeps] It's November-Five-Five- Niner-Delta-Whiskey. - Are the girls okay? - The girls are fine. I don't want them to see me panic. You're not gonna panic. The girls are fine. You can do this, Doug, you sorta have to if you ever wanna eat my barbecue sauce again. Honey bear. [laughs] That's almost funny. November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey, we're ready to hand you off to Fort Myers. Do everything the way you are. You're keeping your heading. You're doing a real nice descent. You've got me headed almost due north here. Number Niner-Delta-Whiskey, that's affirmative. I just didn't wanna turn you while you were descending, but if you feel ready to give it a try… Okay, let's do it. I can try to make a turn. I don't need any weather up here now, ma'am. [Terri] The weather's good here, but if we fly back to Naples, it could get bad. Need reports from the last hour. Give me new ones as you get them. All right. Got it. I wanna know what weather pilots are running into - where he's flying. - Right. - Get me someone from the NOAA. - Copy. - Check weather systems in Fort Myers area. - Already on it. I've got a tropical depression in the Gulf moving inland towards the coast. - How long before it hits their heading? - Not long enough. If he's not wheels down in 45 minutes, this turns into an FAA emergency to a Coast Guard recovery mission. [Lisa] Niner-Delta-Whiskey, just to confirm, you sure you wanna turn left while descending? I could try. Bailey? Bailey, what's wrong? What's wrong? Is everything okay? "This product has been processed in a facility that processes peanuts." [breathing heavily] Mom! Everything's gonna be okay, baby. No, Mom. Bailey's sick! Bailey's sick! She needs her shot! Is she swelling up? Does she have a rash? Mom, she had candy that might've had nuts. I need her EpiPen. Where is it? It's in the luggage compartment, pink backpack. I'm coming. No, you stay up there, and you help Daddy, okay? I can, uh I can do this. You can do it, baby. I can do this. I can I can… I can do this. [grunting] Niner-Delta-Whiskey, you're gonna turn to the left and fly a heading of about 2-7-0. Then continue that descent down to 11,000 feet. All right. Niner-Delta-Whiskey, turn left to 2-7-0 down to 11,000 feet. I can't see the land. Just water. You'll be on ground before weather's a problem. You said there's no weather. How far away is the system? A storm, or showers? - Should we climb? - [Doug] How far away is it? [Terri] To get above the weather? Don't worry. You're gonna be fine. [keyboard clacking] [laptop beeping] - They lied to him. - What? If he's here, and this weather system is here, he's moving south in a south-by-southeast heading. It's going right for him. You're like a baby Al Roker. How do you know all this? Planes have been my thing since I could walk. I'm gonna finish Amelia Earhart's flight one day. You wanna come? Are you crazy? I'm about to hear some random dude die on a plane crash. Kari, what's going on? [Kari] Pilot's dead. Passenger's flying the airplane. - What can I do to help? - I don't know. You can fly anything with wings. We'll follow your lead. November-Five-Five- Niner-Delta-Whiskey, right? Holy hell. - Has he flown a King Air? - Never. Dan, this guy's got no chance. He'll be dead long before he gets to Fort Myers. Lucky if he can slow the airplane enough to approach. Best case, he doesn't kill anyone within a five-mile radius of the airport. Be his simulator. Hang on, Dan. What? When you were teaching me how to fly blind in the simulator, you stood behind me and you talked me through the instructions. This is real-world flying. We can't hit reset if the plane skids off the runway and into a building. It's all the more reason. How far out is he, and what's his altitude? I don't know. He's not on our radar yet. - He can't configure the plane to land. - What you wanna do? When he's in your airspace, tell me how high he is and how fast he's going. - Got it. - How long's he been in the air? Uh… Less than an hour. Damn it. It's full of fuel. Probably. Get the fire and rescue trucks ready, get the first responders ready near businesses and neighborhoods around the airport. [thunder rumbling] King Air. [Ashley] Uh… - You find it? - Kari, it's on the other shelf. [Kari] Got it. [grunts] [grunts] Aw, dang it! Number Five-Delta-Whiskey, you're approaching a lower altitude. Start easing off of those controls so the plane can fly level. What happens if I turn the autopilot back on? I can do it. I'm ready. November-Five-Delta-Whiskey, if that makes you comfortable, you can. [grunts] Yeah, go ahead. - Yes? - [Doug] Yeah, do it. [grunting] All right. Bad idea! Bad idea! Five-Delta-Whiskey, roger. There's a button to help with autopilot, called slewing the heading bug. I saw it in the manual. [man] Niner-Delta-Whiskey, turn the knob to 270 degrees. - 270 degrees. - Okay. I could do that. [grunts in frustration] God, help! [Terri] I got it. It's the same. - [Doug] Good. All right. - [Terri] There! All right. [Lisa] Roger that. Five-Delta-Whiskey, you'll be talking to Fort Myers Airport in a minute. All right. [Lisa] They'll take their time and talk to you to get you down safe. Tune your radio to the Fort Myers Airport frequency. Can you do that? Well, we got a real good copilot up here, so I think we can do just about anything. I think she can. Yeah. [Lisa] Roger that. The frequency is 132.07. [Terri] Got it. Fort Myers... Fort Myers Airport. Got it. [static hissing] [Brian] Niner-Delta-Whiskey, Fort Myers Tower. How do you read? Holy crap. Holy crap. He's gone. Is he gone? Did that dude die? [Brian] Fort Myers Tower. How do you read? I've never heard anybody die before… Okay. This is freaking me out. I'm going home. He's not talking. That means they lost him. [Dan] All right. Here we go. I got some help. - What are you doing? - My friend... Don't do that. That's a federal violation. - He can help. - He can't. Nor can you. I'm still in charge of this whole control center. - Listen to what he says. - Get the cell phone out of here. He can save his life! - Get that phone... - [Kari] Tell the pilot he needs to slow down before he gets close to the airport, or he won't make it. The plane will drop if he's too slow. Has your friend ever flown a King Air? [Kari] Upside down. Take a seat. Relax. Brian, this goes bad, it's not on you. Relax? We need all the help we can get if we want these people to survive. Dan, take me off speaker. Everybody doesn't need to hear what I tell you. He's got to do about five things right to land that plane. That's good to know. But if he misses one of them, he won't make it to see the other four. [Brian] King Air Five-Five- Niner-Delta-Whiskey, you on? King Air Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey, are you with us? King Air Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey, you on? Fort Myers Airport. [Terri sighs] I am. What do you want me to do? Lisa. They've got him. - They got him! - What? He's alive? No way! - [Doug] Turn it to 2-7-0? Niner-Delta… - [grunting] - Maggie, you all right? You find the pen? - Working on it! Where is it? [grunts] There it is. Okay. I got it, Mom! I got it! I got it, Mom! Give your sister the shot, honey. Bailey. [grunts] Bailey, look at me. Look at me, okay? This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you, okay? You can do it, baby. Bailey. Bailey, wake up! Bailey. Bailey. Bailey. Bailey, we're almost on the ground. - Look, we're almost on the ground. - I feel weak. Where are we? We got it. - Look at the instruments there. - Okay, I got it. - See that turn? - Yeah. Wow. - See that dial? - Doing good. - Keep an eye on it. - Right. [Kari] Hang on, Dan. [Brian] All right, King Air Five-Five-Niner-Delta-Whiskey. Fort Myers Approach. And are you descending in the airplane right now, sir? I am. What do you want me to do? Actually, if you can, we can just keep descending. We're getting you some help from another pilot who's familiar with the airplane. Is he in the control tower with you? He is in… - Connecticut. - In Connecticut, but I understand he's a very skilled and experienced airman. I can use all the help I can get. It's just me, and my wife, and my girls up here. He's coming in fast. Help me with this. Here. Help me with this. [Doug] Thank you, sir. You're gonna stay on the horn with me, right? That's correct. I'm here for the duration. I've got nothing else to do but make sure you get all the help you need. [Dan] Yeah. It's a King Air 200. Cockpit looks like nothing he's ever seen before. Probably. What are you doing? Building you a cockpit. [dramatic music playing] [no audio] [no audio] - Did I get it right? - Not quite. Well, what's missing? I could use a copilot. Listen, Dan, we've got a very tight window for how fast he needs to fly. Got it. [Kari] Is he on autopilot? - Ask if he's using autopilot. - November-Niner-Delta-Whiskey, are you using autopilot or are you flying the airplane? [Doug] The autopilot is off. Slow him down. He's all over the place. - We gotta slow him down. - [phone beeps] [John] The plane's over the Gulf of Mexico. He's supposed to turn inland to set up his approach to Fort Myers. If he doesn't make it to land, we got backup. Fort Myers, can you see how fast we're going on the radar? Faster. He's gotta go faster. - They slowed him too much. It'll stall. - Like a car? If he goes too slow, wind will stop flowing over the wing and the plane can drop out of the sky. It's probably what happened to Amelia. Faster. Go faster! He's gotta speed up. The plane will drop. [Brian] Okay. Looks like you're coming up on 5,000 feet just a little slower than we'd like. Um… So, when you're able, make a, make a left turn. We're turning him. Get his speed up. He can't turn going that slow. Make sure he speeds up before he turns. Yeah, how many first responders do you have? Get more. Are you sure I'm in a turn? I can't see very well up here. That compass ain't moving. I don't see land, only water. We over the ocean? - Do you see the horizon? - [Terri] No. [Doug] I cannot see the horizon. All I see is baby blue sky and baby blue water. I don't see land, just ocean. We going the right way? - Look out the window. See anything? - It's all blue. Everything is blue. He's having trouble making the turn. [Lisa] He's flying right toward the storm. It picked up too fast. I thought he had time. If he's over the Gulf, he's looking at blue sky and water. He's disoriented, can't tell where he's turning. Kari, his heading has him flying into a weather system. Damn it! We should've turned him sooner. [dramatic music playing] What is it? What do you see? [Kari] The flight control systems. King Air is built on a Cessna. It may be bigger and fancier, but it still flies the same. Single engine. Tell him to fly it like a single-engine plane. Just like a Cessna. Don't worry about anything else. Just tell him to remember when he was in a Cessna. Tell him to fly it like a single-engine plane. Just like a Cessna. Tell him to remember the last time he was in a Cessna. Okay. Niner-Delta-Whiskey, the information I have is, to fly the aircraft like you would a single-engine. Well, I can do that. The only thing is, the only time I was in one of those was with my brother, and there weren't dark clouds in front of me. Well, your turn looks good. We ain't going down that easy. Very good, sir. [Doug] Okay. I'm at zero-niner-zero. Starting to get the hang of this thing. I don't know if I can outrun these clouds. They're starting to surround us. Niner-Delta-Whiskey, is there a landing checklist? Oh, um… Did you find it, honey? - Did you find a checklist? - [Terri] Yeah. The landing gear levers should be below the main panel, should say "landing gear." I think I know how to put the landing gear down. But this... We're getting bounced around up here. He's about to put landing gear down. No. It's too fast. Don't touch the gear. Not yet. He's too fast. Too hot. Too hot. They're telling me you're too fast for your landing gear. You just tell me when. Help me get slowed down here. Okay, sir. I'll have that for you in a moment. How much fuel do you have, sir? Uh, here's the fuel. Right here. [Doug] Just so you know, we got plenty of fuel. - That's not an issue. - It's an issue for us. Yeah. Get another fire truck. Call around. We need as much water and foam as we can get. This is a twin-engine coming in full tank. If he's not down soon, storm could take him out, and that plane could drop out of the sky. Okay, but where is he now? He's about… [keyboard clacking] …15 miles from the airport. Look at this. Houses and buildings all over. We're right here. Shouldn't we, like, not be here? - That's a really good idea. - [Buggy chuckles] - How far out is he? - About 15 miles. Damn it! - Okay, where is he? - [Dan] 5,300 feet. - He's got alarms going off. - Ignore them. Fly the plane. Brian, Kari said ignore the alarms, just fly the plane. 4,700. - 240 knots. - [Kari] Okay. When we get you a little bit slower, um, I will give you the signal. - [alarm beeping] - Well, tell me how to get slower first. Slow to turn, now I'm too fast to land. What do I do here? Let's go. You don't wanna be near that runway when he comes in. [engines roaring] - I got it. - You watch my altitude and speed. 6,000 feet, 210 knots. Niner-Delta-Whiskey, make a left turn to zero-six-zero. That should line you up with the airport, and then I'll slow you down. Heading bug. Zero-six-zero. - I'll do that. - Put that on. [Doug] Zero-six-zero. Clouds are getting awful close. [Brian] Yes. A few gusts, but you should be fine. Trying to get you to a lower airspeed where you can drop your landing gear and flaps. [Doug] I'm ready and waiting. Can you find the landing checklist? Okay. Flaps. - All right. What do I do? - Right. First thing is approach speed. Okay, pull back on your power a little bit at a time. Okay? Until you reach 160 knots. - So, where are we headed? - The airport. That seems like the unsafest place to be during a plane crash! Five miles out, 3,100 feet, 180 knots. At 160 knots, let the landing gear down. All right, I'm lined up for the runway. Looks like a little... - It's like a little brown slip. - [Terri] Yeah. Do you show me lined up with the runway? Yes, sir. That is correct. You have the field in sight. Bailey. I feel weak. Where are we? You know what? We're in a cumulus cloud. Look. Remember that? You always wanted to see one up close. Pretty sure it's a cirrus. [laughs] How are the girls? They're doing good. They'll be better when we get on the ground. Make sure you're buckled up back there! He's got the field in sight. Control his speed. Landing gear's going down soon. He's gotta control speed. [Brian] Okay. When you get your speed under control, descend down to 2,000 feet. I am showing your speed at 160 knots. 2,200 feet. 160 knots. Landing gear down. Now! I need you to lower your landing gear down now, sir. [Terri] Okay, I got it. I'm ready when you tell me. - [Doug] Just pull it down. - Now? - Yes, pull it down. - I got it! [Doug] All right. Landing gear's going down. [whirring] [beeps] [whirring] [Brian] All right, make sure you stay on throttle. I need you to maintain 140 knots. 400 feet. 120. I can't hold this thing on the runway. It's drifting off. I'm floating left. I can't hold it on the runway. I'm floating left. This is getting real bad. I can't hold this thing. I need help. It's a wind shear! Wind'll blow the plane off the runway before they land! [automated voice] Caution! Caution! Manual. Stall. - I got alarms going off! - [automated voice] Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. Brian, he's not lined up! [Doug] Help me! Help me! Pull up! Pull up! Add full power. [automated voice] Pull up. He's going around. Crosswind. Crosswinds. [electrical buzzing] Hello? - Hello? - [phone clicks] Hello? Dan, you still there? Dan! - [phone beeping] - Damn it. [line ringing] This is Dan Favio. Please leave a message. [Beeps] Kari? Kari? - I've lost him. - What? You've gotta be kidding me. This is getting real bad. I can't hold this thing! I need help! What are you doing? We can use the tail number to locate the plane and pilot. The FAA database. [Ashley] He's in the database. He should be a registered pilot. Didn't you tell me that when I was in flying lessons? I didn't think you were listening. I listen to every word you say, Kari. [keyboard clacking] [automated voice] Please say a command. [Dan] Does anyone have a charger? - Anyone? - I do. Come on. Mom? Mom, I think we got another problem. [thunder rumbles] [thunderclap] I think we're done. God, help me. Please help me. [exhales sharply] Doug? [thunder rumbling] Doug! Doug? We're… We're done. No, we've been through bigger challenges than this, and we made it through together. We can make it! [thunderclap] Ah! Can we make it? [beeping] [beeping and vibrating] Okay. Sorry. Ugh. Sorry. - Hello? - Hello! Please don't hang up! Hi! Um, any chance you're in an airplane right now? - It's not a good time, honey. - No, Mom. You're gonna wanna take this. Hello? [Beeps] Hello? Who's that? Doug? - This is Kari Sorenson. - Who? I been talking to the controllers on the phone. How in the world did you find me? [Kari] I'll explain once we get you on the ground. [laughs] Well… [thunderclap] It's real bad up here. I can't control this airplane. Listen. There are three lights in the center of the control panel. Middle of the control panel, near the top. Means your landing gear's still down. Pull the white lever next to the throttle. [whirring] [Kari] Doug, listen. My family was in a similar situation to the one that you're in right now. I couldn't do anything for 'em. And I lost 'em. But I'll be damned if I lose you today. You don't know me, you can't see me, but I'm here to help you. Believe in me. I don't think that's gonna happen. I got blown off the runway. I can't control this thing. Yes. Yes, you can. You've come this far. We're almost there. Sometimes you gotta trust in things you can't see. [Terri] Doug, you've done things I didn't think were possible. You've been a hero to those girls a thousand times. And I love you. And I believe you can do this. You can do it. All right. What do you want me to do? We need to make a turn. [thunder rumbles] Don't stop! We're minors! They won't take us to jail! - Where is the plane going? - Over the ocean! - I'm not riding out to the ocean! - Hey! You can't do that! Come back! No! Come back here! [siren wailing] [tires screeching] All right. This is it, Doug. Press the left rudder. Turn your yoke a little to the right. Keep the runway in your center. Keep your ailerons and rudder coordinated. Ride the wind. Don't fight it. Get ready to touch down on one wheel, easy as you can. Release rudder, pull your throttle all the way back. What about the brakes when I land? Don't worry about them. Let the airplane glide, and bleed off speed when you touch down. [tires screeching] [siren wailing] - [Terri] Gear is down. - All right. All right. [whirring] I love you, girls! We love you, Daddy! [Bailey] I love you, Daddy. I love you. [Doug] I love you too. Girls. I love you. I love you, Momma. - I love you, Momma. - [Maggie] I love you. Fasten your seat belts tight. Let's pray. Oh, God, send your angels to hold up the wings and help us land this plane. I really wanna see my girls grow up and graduate. And fall in love, and get married, and have their own daughters. And I just want you to be happy. Just do whatever you want. And always love yourself the way I love you. I'm just so grateful, God. I'm so grateful for my beautiful daughters. Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. - Amen. - [Maggie and Bailey] Amen. [Kari] Okay, Doug. Now I'm gonna prepare you for a crosswind landing. Just pull back on the throttle. Easy. There he is. Okay. He's floating. He's floated long. - He's gonna miss. - [Dan] He's too high. [Dan] First responders are in the wrong place! [Ralph] On it. - They need to be further down! - Yeah. Not answering. - Come on! - Go. Do something. Oh, my God! They're back! They went around! They're coming in for another landing! [sirens blaring] [Kari] Pull the yoke all the way back. Kill the throttle. Get off the rudder! Now, Doug! Let it go, Doug! Let go! Easy as you can. [sirens blaring] [Doug] Please, God, help me protect my family. Let go, Doug! Let go! [all cheering] Yes! [sirens blaring] [all cheering] Come here. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
