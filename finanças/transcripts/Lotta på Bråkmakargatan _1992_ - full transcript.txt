Come on, Skotty. What weather! Come along. I want to come too! - You can't, you're too small. - I'm not too small at all. - Yes you are. - You see? She's as stubborn as an old goat. - I want yellow with red stripes. What do you want? - I'll have green ones. - Then we'll take red ones back to Lotta. - She shouldn't get anything because of all her bawling. - We have to get her something. I promised Mum. - Stupid Jonas. He's so stupid. I'm going to whip him. I am. Because I'm not too small at all! - Aren't you at least going to have a sandwich? - I want to go to the square too like Mia and Jonas! - You shouldn't go out in this weather when you've got a cold. - When you were little, how big were you? - A bit like you. - I think you were quite big then. - Yes, big enough, just like you. - I want to go to the square too. - They'll bring back sweets for you. They're going to Larssons on the way home. They'll be back soon. Hurry up and get dressed now. - I'm not too small at all. Look there's Skotty. Hello, Skotty. - Hello, Skotty. So Auntie Berg must be in here. - And two almond cubes. - There you are. That's three fifty. - Here you are. - Thanks a lot. - Welcome, next? - Good morning, Mia. - Morning, Auntie Berg. - So where's your little Lotta? - She's at home. She wasn't allowed out today. She's got a cold. - I'm not at home at all. And I'm not too small at all. I'm big enough, my mother thinks so. - Yes I think so too. - Bye bye, Auntie Berg. - Goodbye to you. - Go home! - I'm not doing that at all. I want to go to the shop too. And get some sweets. - But—here you are then. - Number four. What are you going to have, then? - I want to taste it. - Yes. - Don't you have a handkerchief? - Yes, I certainly have. But I don't lend it to people I don't know. - Come on now. - What is it? - We're so hungry. - She's always embarrassing us. - Yeah. What do you think Mum's going to say? You went out even though you're not allowed? - I think she'll tell me to go to my room and stay there until I can behave. - Yes, I really hope so. - Go to your room, and stay there until you can behave. And then dress properly. It's a good job I have you, Bamsen. You're the only one who listens to me. Mia and Jonas never listen. - You know what Mum said? She said if you're nice, then we can stay in here and play. Are you? - Well? - Sometimes I'm not. - What shall we play then? - Don't know. - Let's play don't touch the floor. - No, let's play hospital. - Yes, then I'm a nurse. - Then I'm a doctor. - What about me? - You're a sick child. - Then we can examine you. - No, I want to be a doctor and push a spoon down Mia's throat. - Yeah, dream on. - Stethoscope, sister. - There you are, Doctor. - Thank you. - Thanks. There you are, Doctor. - This will probably go well. Just lie still. Open your mouth really wide. A huge opening. Yes, thank you. Yes, sister, this looks really serious. We'll probably have to give her an injection. - That's probably best. Now we'll see if you can be a good little patient. - I don't want to. - Don't worry, it'll be all right. - Just lie still, let's have a look. - No! - Lie still. - Stop it! You're not sticking a needle in me. - We're just pretending. - You know he's not really going to inject you. - I don't want an injection anyway! - Then we can't play hospital. - We could have Bamsen as a patient. - Yes! - Not on your life! Anyway, I'm going to get dressed. That's what Mum said. - Daddy's coming! - Race you down! - I know, let's hide. - Yeah, quick! Go in over there, Lotta. - He's coming! - He's coming now. - Look! Hello! Anyone at home? - Hello. From the square. - Thank you! Lovely. - Where's the usual racket in here? - What d'you mean? - Where are the kids? They're not ill, are they? - No, think again! We're not! - What kids I've got! It has to be like crashing thunder when Daddy comes home, otherwise Daddy will be worried. - Daddy! - Crashing thunder, eh—you seem to manage that very well yourself. - We're going to see Auntie Berg now. - Come on then! - Yes, come on! Hello, Auntie Berg. Hello. I was just about to bake waffles. Want some? - Yes! - Let's sit outside in the garden. - Your waffles are the best! - Does Lotta want some more juice? - Yes thanks. What have you done to your leg? - There? It's varicose veins. That happens when you get old. This lock is a bit complicated. There you go. Let's see. - I want to look at that picture up there. - See that? That's me when I was little. - Were you really that small? - Yes. - Let's have a look at the nice things now. - I'm going to swing! - Listen to this now. ♪ Bye my father, bye my mother, bye my sister and my brother ♪ ♪ Now I am travelling to a distant land and will not come again ♪ ♪ I think tralala, I think tralala ♪ ♪ I think tralala, I think tralala ♪ Oh, how beautifully I sing.

Don't you remember that Noah who built a boat?

Right, have we got everything? 14 sandwiches, 20 pancakes, three kids and one angry little wife. - And Bamsen! - And Bamsen, of course. - That old pig. - It's not a pig. It's a bear. - Then what kind of bear? - Is it an ordinary bear or a polar bear? - Don't fight. - It's a pig bear! Think about it. Stop! - Stop! - No. Won't we be there soon?

Life jackets! - Here you go, kids. - No, do we have to? Annoying. - Shouldn't Bamsen have a life jacket? - I hadn't actually thought about that. - Come on, we're going. - Right, go off and play. - Wait for me! - Hurry up then. - I'm going to lie here all day, and not move from this spot. You get to take care of the kids. This is nice. - It must be deep here, don't you think? - It's probably 100 meters. - Children! Look! - Fishing rods! - Yes! Great. - Right! - Did you make them yourself? - I certainly did. Here kids. Worms. - Worms too. Great. - There you are. - Thanks. - There you are. Lotta, I'll help you later. I'll help you with the worms. - Look at them crawl. - They're so disgusting. Bamsen, do you want a taste? You want a worm too? - Watch out for the hooks now, kids. - That's good enough. There. - That's so gross. - Nothing dangerous about a worm, Lotta. - Yes, little worm. You're going for a swim. You're going down into the water. Then you have to help me get a bite. Right! Plop! - Here, Bamsen, you can sit and watch while we fish. I'll pick you up after. Why's nothing happening? - Not a bite. - They'll soon bite. Patience is a fisherman's best friend. Oh, I think I got a bite. It must be a big fish. - Yes, I said we'd get a bite. - Typical. - Bamsen! - Mia, what have you done? - Done? - Look at the state of him. - I can't help it if you put him so close to the water! - Kids, don't fight now. Don't be so angry, Lotta. Bamsen'll be dry soon. - There shouldn't be people like you around when we're fishing. - Maybe he thought it'd be fun to have a swim. - He didn't think that at all! He hates swimming. You can see that. - I don't think it was such a big deal. - Poor little Bamsen. Oh how stupid everyone is to you. I'm never fishing again! Hear me? - Let's go and do something else. - Yeah, we won't get a bite anyway. - Look, a bird's nest. - Yeah! Lovely. Sit here and you'll see better. - Aren't they cute! - Look, Bamsen! They're so cute! No, don't touch! - Why? - You mustn't touch them. - But why? - If you touch the eggs, the mother bird notices that someone else has been there. - Then she leaves her babies. - I want to show Mum. - Then let's bring Mum here. - Yes. Come on! - I'm supposed to be the leader! It's a little cold up here. Can I crawl in beside you? - What are they doing? - They're sleeping. - What a sleepyhead! - Be quiet. - The kids might come. - They're off playing. - Come on, we're going now. - But we were going to get Mum. - You think she wants to see birds' eggs now! Now I'm the leader! - I'm getting really dizzy. - So am I. - We mustn't be without our life jackets here. - That's only when we're fishing. - Wait here. - What's he doing? - Watch this! - You can't do it. - Yes, you did it! - Well done! - Guess who this is then? There, there. - Auntie Berg. It's Auntie Berg! - Guess who this is. Who's that? Patience is a fisherman's best friend. It's Dad! It's Dad! Dad! - And who's this? - Oh my God! - What's he doing? Jonas. - Jonas! Jonas! - What're you doing?! It's Skotty. - Jonas, get down from there immediately! - Help! - Jonas! Calm down, Jonas. Dad's coming! - Jonas! - Help! I'm getting cramp, Dad! I'm getting cramps! - Daddy's coming, Jonas. Hold on! - Help! Help! - Hurry up! - I'm drowning! Mum, help! Dad! I'm drowning. Mum! Help! I'm drowning! - Mum! Help! - Sit still. - Help, Dad. - Hurry now. - Take it easy. - What're you laughing at? - Don't you see how funny they look? - Dad— - What's so funny now? - We have to hurry. - What? - Come on, hear me? - You look like an Indian. - Cool— - Come on, Lotta. You too. So, do we have everything now? - Yes we have. - Bamsen. Where's my Bamsen? - We have to go now. - Not without Bamsen. But Jonas might be ill if we don't go now. Bamsen can have a nice evening in the forest by himself, then I'll pick him up tomorrow, OK? - Never. A goblin might come and scare Bamsen. - If Bamsen meets an old troll, it'll probably be the troll who gets scared. - You're an idiot! - When did you last have Bamsen? - Twelve o'clock. - You don't even know how to tell the time. - No, you really don't. Let's go. Come on, Lotta. - Come on, Jonas. - Bamsen—didn't you have him when we saw the bird's eggs? - Yeah. - I'm sure she did! - You're quite sure about that? - Yes we are. - Yes we are. - We have to get him. Come quick! Help her. Jonas, you too. Poor little Bamsen. Typical. This'll make me ill too. - Bamsen, where are you? Bamsen. - Here they are. - Oh, Bamsen! Have you been sitting here all day guarding the cute little bird eggs? - Sure! - Oh, how cute the eggs are. - Poor mother bird. - Why? - She probably hasn't ventured here all this time. - Why? Pig bears are the best scarecrows of all. - Quiet! Come on out now. - Don't fight. - Bamsen's so silly. - No he's not, not at all. - He's stupid and very ugly. - Hurry up. - He's so very ugly. - No he's not! - Don't fight now. Come now. - Dad thinks he's stupid too. - No, dad doesn't think he's stupid. - What did you think was the most fun? - I thought climbing trees was the best. - Just because you climbed the highest. - No, come on, Lotta, let's get to bed. - Sleep tight. - This is where I'm going to sleep tonight. - But Lotta. Are you really going to stay there? - Yes. What did you think was the most fun today, Lotta? Wasn't it when you found Bamsen? - That old pig. - No, the best part was when Jonas fell in the lake. I can ride a bike too. - No you can't. You're too small. Let's go for a ride after our homework. - Yes let's do that. - I certainly can ride a bike. Secretly. - Four times five? - Twenty. - One, eight, four, seven. - Quiet. - Five, one. - Four, two, one, zero. - Will you shut up! - Eight, seven, five, one. - Be quiet! You're disturbing us! - Shut up, we're doing our homework. - So am I. - Food's ready. - You're just playing. You don't even go to school. - I certainly do. Secretly. - Come on now. May we leave the table? - Yes, of course. - Good. Let's go cycling. - Yeah. - I can ride a bike too. - You can't ride a bike. You don't even have a bike. - Jonas. - Just an old tricycle. - There you are. I can't ride a bike when I don't have a bike. - No, of course not. - Oh sweetheart, come and sit here. I want a bicycle. - But Lotta, Dad and I have decided the tricycle will have to last another year. - When's my birthday? - The day after tomorrow. - So—what do you want for your birthday? - A bike. You're as stubborn as an old goat, Lotta. - Come on, Mum. Hurry up now. - Yes, yes, I'm coming. - And so Jonas, you go first, you go first with that one. - Watch out for the lights. Mia, then Mummy, and very quiet so Lotta doesn't hear, and then we sneak in. - Careful on the stairs. - Just stay outside the door. One, two, three. ♪ What day is it?

And on my birthday as well. - Oh, sweetheart. - Where does it hurt the worst? - Everywhere. - Show me? - My forehead. Look, there's blood. - Oh no, look. - Blood on my birthday! - Dear child. Come on, Lotta. Come and we'll patch you up. I'll take Bamsen. Come on. Let's go into the kitchen. What an accident. - What a mean and stupid bike. - Yes. Pretty clever though. Imagine it getting out of the shed all by itself. Weird. - It was me who took it. But I only borrowed it when you were taking a nap. Can you forgive me for that? - Of course. But a big bike like that, you're risking your life. You should have one that's a bit smaller. - A tricycle? That's what Daddy thinks. - No, a real bike, just smaller. Just right for you. - Tell Daddy that. - What have you done with your bracelet? - My bracelet! Where's my bracelet?! - Such a shame for you. We'd better look for it. There. No. No bracelet there either. - This is a horrible birthday. - No. - I'm going home. - Bye bye for now. Hello! Lotta! Hello, Lotta! What's up with you? Why are you so angry? - Because this is a horrible birthday. - But why? - What is it? - Tell me. Why are you so angry? - Because I've lost my nice bracelet that I got from Auntie Berg. And that stupid bike that just whizzes and whizzes without braking. - What bike? - Auntie Berg's bike. It was really heavy to get out of the shed all by myself. I had to nick it while she was sleeping. - Well it serves you right if you've lost your bracelet. - That's right. Auntie Berg is kind enough to give you a bracelet, and then you go straight down the path and steal her bike. - I don't want to talk to you! This is still a horrible birthday! Wait! That's probably what we did too. Jonas is crazy! Mummy said you mustn't ride like that. It's forbidden, just remember that. Daddy! ♪ What day is it?

What a weird old man! - Don't stare like that, Lotta. - The man has a wart on his chin. - Quiet, he can hear you. - Doesn't he know himself that he has a wart on his chin? - Any new passengers? - Lotta— - Tickets please. - Your ticket? - You've already seen it. - Can I trouble you for your tickets? - Can we have ours? - Here. - Thank you. - How old are the children? - The boy's ten and the girl's eight. - Fine, then that'll be half a ticket. - And I'm five and Mum's 37 and this is Bamsen. On this train all Bamsens travel free. Have a nice trip! Thanks. - Look at my other ear. - You look weird. - Can I have one too? - Yes. Neat. Now I'm going to make a different kind of hat. What is it? What're you doing?! What are you doing?! - Nice, Lotta. - Why are you sticking slices of sausage on the window? - Because they stick much better than the meatballs. You know you mustn't play with food. - Let's go. - Yeah. - I want to come too. - No. You're staying here. Hello, Majken! - here they are at last! What fun! - So you finally made it! - Hello everybody! Welcome! - There are a few more bags here. - Hiiii! - Hi, Grandpa! - I can't lift you. You get a hug. - You've grown so much! Hello, darling. - Hi Mum. Hi Dad. So nice to be here. - You were good on the train, weren't you? - Damn yes!. - Lotta! Now we don't have to be nice any longer. Shall we go in or— - Yes, it's not thst long since we saw each other. God how big they've become. As long as you get them started, they're happy to follow the one in front. The cows! - Go on then! - Go on. - This is going well, isn't it, Lotta? Here puss-puss. It's so cute! Can I hold it? Kids! Time to go. Lotta! - How cute the calves are! - Yes, aren't they. Poop! That's so gross! - You mustn't say that about manure, you know. If only you knew how important it is. Without manure, you see, nothing can grow. That's how it works, do you understand? - It's still poop! - Come on now. - Damn! No!! - What are you doing? - Going to the Farmers' Co-op. With the kids. - That'll be fun for them. - Yeah. - Then I want to come too. - No, you're a bit too small for that. - I'm not small at all. I can even ride a bike too. - Yes, but not on the main roads. You have to wait until you're as big as Jonas and Mia. - Exactly. - Bye! - Bye bye. - Let's go! - Bye! - Take care! You get to help Grandma and Mummy in the kitchen. You pick out these ugly berries and throw them away. See? Aren't you going to help Grandma then? Grandma's going to stir the pot. Oh that's nice. We're finally getting some rain. That's good. - What's so good about it? - It's good for the soil and everything that sprouts and grows. That's why we need rain, you see. - Rain and cow poop, yeah? - Little Lotta. Rain and cow poop, exactly. When grandma's finished we'll have a game of pachisi. It's lovely not having to be outside in this bad weather. - How's it going? - Very well. - Where's Lotta? - She was here just now. - Lotta! - Lotta! Strange! She might be at Majken's. - Has Majken seen Lotta? - No. - We have to find her. - What could the kid have come up with now? Maybe this'll help— - Lotta! Why are you standing up there on the manure pile?! - To get big! - But my dear girl. - I want to be big! Big like Jonas and Mia. - You're completely drenched. - Damn, I want to be big! Food's ready! - Could you please pass me a herring? - This is going to be so good with herring! - Baltic herring is the best thing I know. It's the best I know now and it was the best I knew when I was a boy. I'm doing exactly like you now. - Herring on a Sunday? Damn it! - Really! - Look— - Haven't I told you a thousand times not to say that? Grandma doesn't like it either. - No. - Out you go until you can be nice again! - That kid—! - It'll pass. Stupid mother! - Hello. Are you nearly done? - Haven't you eaten all the herring yet? - I'm not crazy, am I? - Just hurry up. Go on out to play, you two. She gets to sit there until she's eaten everything on her plate. Lotta, whatever are you doing?! What're you doing! - Damn, he can surely swim a little? - Do you remember what I said? If you're going to say that word again, we're going to have to get out of here. You know what grandma thinks too. But where's Lotta? - Lotta! - I'm leaving now. - What's all this? - Where are you going? - I'm going home to Daddy. He's much nicer than Mummy. - Goodbye, Lotta. Thank you for coming. - Goodbye, looking forward to next summer. - Lotta— Are you all right, Lotta? Aren't you leaving? Well? - Damn, I can't get on the train alone. - But darling, listen. Wouldn't it be better to stay here with us? We'll feel so terribly lonely and sad if you leave us. - Yes, you will. - Yes, we will. My baby. - Lotta. Don't be sad. - Don't be sad. - I don't want to talk to you. - Little sweetheart. Here's someone you might want to talk to. - Hello! - Daddy! - Hi! - Hi! - Whose kids are these? They look just like mine. - Hi Dad. -Jump in. - I'm so glad you came. - Right. OK. Hang on tight. Let's go. Yes. Here we come. Hello hello! - Turn! Come in and I'll read to you. You'd like that, wouldn't you. - Good night to you. - Good night, good night. And Daddy gets a hug. Good night, Lotta. - Can we look in the Bible, Grandma? - What kids, eh? -That's the burning bush. Is that God? We read about that in school. Is that Jesus? - No. He was a Pharoah, he dammed the Nile . Yes exactly. Shame on you, grandma! What did you just say? - What? - You mustn't say damn!
