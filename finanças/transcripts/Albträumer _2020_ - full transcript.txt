Darkdreamers Remember that? You wanted to do it too. You copied everything he did. What about this? It's one of the last ones. Don't worry about tomorrow. We'll manage okay. You know what? I think you should decide. It's not just for us. Anyone can go to the cemetery. I spoke to Mrs. Wengler yesterday. She says you're a godsend for this facility. They're her words, not mine. Hold on. Vincent is back. Just for a few days. I've sorted that out. He's in a wheelchair, huh? He seems to be doing fine. Congratulations. I just want us all to have a good day tomorrow. Yeah, so do I. Oh, Rebekka! So you came after all? Your mind must be elsewhere. No, I'm fine. Let me do that. Won't you join us? It's been two years since he was torn from our family. We shed tears for him, but we will carry on. We'll give each other courage and strength. Let us take a moment of silence. In silence, each of us can remember those happy times when he was with us. There is a kingdom of the living, and a kingdom of the dead. Between them is a bridge built with bricks made of love. Anchored by our tears... and its mortar... Vincent? What the hell is this? What are you doing here? My mother's over there. You know what it'll do to her if she sees you? You enjoy hurting people, huh? Just let us grieve in peace. You're not even grieving. They're waiting for you. "Is that the psycho?" Don't get upset. You all go on ahead... "Yes, it's him. How dare he?" "Isn't he to blame for it all?" "Our good boy would never have done that!" That's it! I'm going to deal with him! "He's the one who jumped off the bridge with Dennis. Him there! Just like that. For no reason!" It's alright. We've discussed this. She spoke to me first. Can't you let us grieve in peace? -What are you grieving for? For yourselves? Because you all despised the Dennis I knew. Leave my family alone, okay? Did you get what you wanted? Are you happy now? "Darkdreamers". That's his Insta account. Rebekka! DARKDREAMERS FOR DENNIS FROM REBEKKA TOGETHER WE ARE STRONG I'll report him! -It won't help. Why won't it help? Why go to the police again? That never works! But he can't be allowed to do as he pleases! You know him, Christine. He just wants to provoke us. I spoke to his mother. He's leaving tomorrow. I bet he's in therapy. -Apparently it's not helping. Who knows what your brother saw in him. -Yeah. Everyone hates him. Hey, Rebekka, why did he come back now? How should I know? Did he really try to beat up your dad? How did Sebi react? I would've punched him. -Yeah, sure, big mouth! Now shut it and go drown what's left of your brain. Thanks. Yes, thanks. -You can talk, bitch! You know what? Screw Vincent. Ignore him. You have better things to do. Forget all that shit and focus more on yourself. And your dreams. Our dreams! America, baby! Endless freedom! I doubt my parents will allow it. Bullshit! I know it's a bad time, but they can't stop you. You're an adult. Not quite. -Okay, in a few days! Yeah... Okay... Just say we're studying. Melli, I do it for you all the time. Please! Okay, thanks. Vincent? Vincent, come on! You know what? Fuck you! Fuck you, man! Hi. Why are you bothering me? You're here because of your brother... And in secret, too. Right? Did you two go to the bridge a lot? What do you want to know? Why we killed ourselves? Okay, we did it because of affluent neglect. Or lovesickness. Or satanism. Which do you like best? Wait, you know what? Because of you. Yeah, that's good. Why are you like this? Dennis was my brother! Do you think I don't care? Come along if you want to. Don't come if you don't want to. Wait, Vincent! Wait, man! Shit! It's nice, huh? Nicer than if it were intact. Come on. It's why you came, right? Vincent? Vincent! This isn't funny! Shit! Vincent? Vincent? Oh, my God! Welcome... ... back. Everything's fine, you survived. Congratulations. Did you two do this? Dennis drew most of it. DEATH IS TRUTH We listened to this every time. I can't stand all that screaming. This is pure beauty. If you're willing to see it. Was Dennis gay? Ask your parents. Are you gay? You can meet up with people without fucking them. When did Dennis do this? It doesn't matter! Leave me alone! You're so fucked up! You're so fucking normal! Why are you here? Fuck off! Fuck off! MOM: 5 MISSED CALLS Oh, fuck! I'm sorry. I lost track of time. Where were you? Melanie was at her dance class. I went for a walk. Ah! And I get to plan your birthday alone? -I just wanted... Yeah, sure! Everyone just wants... Does anyone ask how I feel? Do you even care? YOUR LOVE IS THE KNIFE THAT TWISTS IN MY GUT LOVE IS THE HATE OF COWARDS LIES... LIES... Hi. Hi. Can't you sleep? Don't think badly of Mom. It brings back bad memories, that's all. I know. Are you okay? Did Dennis ever have a girlfriend? I think he was gay. You think he suffered because of It? Did Vincent put that in your head? Is that why you met him? Never mind. I just hope no one saw you. People here gossip enough. I... I just wanted to... Vincent finally has his own life now. And we have ours. I trust you with that. DARKDREAMERS HAS ACCEPTED YOUR REQUEST DARKDREAMERS Oh, God! Oh, God. Sorry! Hello. -Hello. Are you okay? Hey, what... It's alright, you can talk to me. Pull over. -What? Pull over, please. -Okay, sure. Can you go shopping alone? I forgot something. Okay. But you're scaring me a bit. Is everything really okay? Forget it. I trust you. If Dad asks, can you say I went with you? Hello, Rebekka. Can I help you? Vincent? Hey. You have a visitor. Fine, I'll leave you alone. -I didn't let her in! Hey! Why are you still here if it bothers you? -Your dad asked me that too. Why do you all think I want to stay here? Maybe it's better if you keep this. What do you want? Come with me to the bridge? That's not a good idea. Are you scared? Yes. You scare me. Vincent, I can't do it alone. And you can't either. I landed on my legs. Over there somewhere. Everything was spinning. Then I passed out. I don't know for how long. Everything was numb. All I could see were the treetops. The sunlight burned through my eyelids. I tried to breathe, but my lungs were just stuck. Then I faint again. But suddenly I see him. He's still alive. We're both still alive. Am I dreaming? Is this death, or... ... does it just feel like it? His chest has stopped moving. He's stopped breathing. There's a darkness that is so dark... .. that it shimmers crimson. Hey! I know... Sometimes it's all... ... so hard. Yes, and it'll stay that way. I wish there was something else I could say. Hey, someday... ... it will be over. Trouble with Sebastian? Did he say something? Why didn't you tell me you're meeting Vincent? It's nothing... I get it. I mean, with Dennis and all... But that guy is... He's gone already. He's gone. What did Sebi say about America? You haven't asked your parents yet! I don't believe it! It's just insanely complicated right now. A few weeks won't change that, and we have to apply for our visas soon. You have to decide what you want. And I know you want this. You're just afraid of your parents. Will you talk to them? -Yes, I will. Wow. Where'd that come from? Everything okay? Vincent? Why are you here? It's kind of cute, how child-like they get right before they die. Vincent, I thought you were gone. I thought so too. Know why I'm still here? This is 3,000 euros. Your dad gave it to me so I'd fuck off. First I thought it was directed against me. But... ... now I think it's directed against you. What did he say? -What's this? I'm just saying goodbye. I owe you this. And I owe you this. Au revoir. Did you take a look at the university info we took home? I'm sure it would make Sebastian happy. Melli's going to America. Yes, Melanie is. And now you want to go too, or what? That can wait, right? I'm sure Melli's not paying it herself. Who cares? We have the money. Now listen here... We're not poor, but... -A few grand is no problem, huh? Are you crazy? Why? The fucking party will probably cost just as much. "Fucking party"? What's wrong with you? -I didn't want... You'll stay home today and help your mother. You can't expect us to handle everything for you. Where do we put Martin? He needs to be here... ... on the family table. Right? Yup. Sebastian will sit next to your Dad. NEW MESSAGE FROM DARKDREAMERS Are you even listening? We can cancel the party, you know? Seriously. If it's too much for you... -It's fine. It's fine, okay? I'll be right back. What are you doing? -Re-negotiating. We need more cash. -You can't be here! Oh, should I ask your parents for your hand first? I can't do this now! You're the reason I stayed. Rebekka? Your mom always lived in her own world. But don't you think she's gradually... Just be glad she didn't see us. Well, at least she has feelings, unlike your father. The friendly ones... They're the worst. When I was unconscious... ... I saw him. I see him all the time. In nightmares, when I'm awake... What does he want? I don't know. He looks angry. Sometimes I wish it'd been the other way around. Then he'd have to deal with all this... ... instead of us. I think I see him because of you. Well, then... So basically, you hang out with me so you can see him? It's not about kissing me, it's about your brother! What? No! Who says I want to kiss you, anyway? Don't you? Yes, I do. -Are you sure? Really? I love you. I want out of here. This is no life! You really want to live like this? The world is so big. Where will I live? Tell me! -Costa Rica? Costa Rica? Okay, Costa Rica. I'm serious. Deal? -Deal! Deal? Can you at least leave that here? All she needs is warmth and rest. It's just in case. Thanks. Rebekka? Don't worry, Thomas says your lungs are okay. We were lucky. Vincent won't harm you anymore. I promise. Are you okay? What's going on with Vincent? Fine, okay. Sebastian? I'm sorry. It's okay. Six months in San Francisco? So long? You don't know about it at all? I didn't know it was so important to you. Not important? You know what? I'll go alone, then. Got it? NEW MESSAGE FROM DARKDREAMERS Don't you want to see me? Sure, but I'm afraid. Afraid? Of me? You should be. I'm sorry I killed you. You saved my life. I don't want you to do this. Why not? I can't. I have to go. I have to go back. My parents will kill me. That's still my job. Come with me. I can't. Why not? We have money. So why not? I can't. I really can't. It's my birthday in three days. I really can't. I really can't. Do you really mean it? -Yes. And you? I can't even imagine it, no kids in the house. I know, but it's not easy. But you're young. You have to follow your dreams. So... It was actually meant to be a birthday present... We made a few phone calls and it worked. America, I mean. Shit, what are you doing here? Why are you still here? -You're making it worse! That's a matter of opinion. Stop! Stop it! Rebekka? You're going to Vegas, right? First we fly to New York, and from there we'll do a tour. But it all depends... ... on the au-pair jobs... -That's so cool! It all depends on how we organize it. I missed you. Rebekka? Oh, God! Dude! Come here! Come here! Huh? Fuck off? What? Leave me... Sebastian, no! - What do you want? Hey! No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, Sebastian! Go away! What? Because of him? Fuck you, Rebekka. Rebekka? Rebekka! -No! Rebekka! Hold up! I can manage alone, okay? It doesn't look like it. What are you doing? Are you totally nuts? -You just don't get it! You don't want to go to America. Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Why do you always destroy everything? Why do you always destroy everything? -It's already destroyed! I told you it was a bad idea! Didn't I tell you it was bad idea? I told you! So that's how it feels to be you? -Yes, that's how it feels! Free and manipulative! Lonely! Oh, and I killed Dennis too. Fuck you. I have plane tickets for Costa Rica. For tomorrow. I often used to find Mom asleep at the kitchen table. She'd waited the whole night, though she knew he wouldn't come. It's our nature to always want to protect you. From yourself, if necessary. Like I should've done for your brother. Rebekka, maybe it's better for him too. I made some inquiries. Vincent had to change therapists three times. He was institutionalized for four months. -And now? Well... For the sake of procedure we need you to make a statement. I've marked the relevant paragraphs. "Harassment, breaking and entering, sexual harassment"? -That's just legal jargon... Rebekka, we're trying to help you! We do everything for you! Now do something for us! Did you do this to Dennis when he met up with Vincent? Rebekka? I can understand you. But we can't help him. There's just no place here for Vincent. It'd be better if he wasn't here. Then we can lead a normal life again. -What normal life? Should I drink myself happy every night like you? That's enough! Rebekka! Rebekka! Open the door! Open the door, Rebekka! Rebekka, I won't let that psycho ruin my life! You can't just destroy all this! Look what I found. Maybe it's better if you keep this. If you'd asked me why I came back a few weeks ago, I'd have said I have no idea. But now I know. -You're here for Dennis. No, not for Dennis. It was never about Dennis. Rebekka, I love you. Will you come with me? Do you really mean it? Vincent, do you mean it? -Yes. Are you sure? I love you. Will you come with me? Are you still afraid of me? Yes. Yes, I am. More than ever. You understand why now? Yes. Yes, I know why. "My dreams are lies I tell to comfort myself. In truth, I've always known Vincent doesn't love me. He never loved me, he just toyed with me. Because he saw the real me. He saw how worthless I am. His kisses, his touch, his tenderness... Without him, I am nothing." What happened with Dennis? If it wasn't about Dennis, why did he write that? I thought you stopped believing your dad. -Were you two together? Rebekka, this isn't about Dennis. Okay? It's not about him, it's about you. It's about us. You're the reason I'm still here. Is that your game? Did you tell Dennis that too? -What do you want? The truth. Just for once. I'm not scared of you. -You shouldn't be. Come on. Tell my daughter what you did with Dennis. How you fucked him. You liked that he loved you. You didn't care you were destroying him. You destroyed everything, like always! -I didn't destroy a fucking thing! I would've done anything for him! Anything! Go on, show her who you really are! Vincent! Vincent! Yes. Yes, we fucked. What difference does it make? Where did you get the letter? -From Dennis. Did he give it to you? -That's not important. Is it his suicide note? It's not a suicide note! He left me letters like that every two weeks. They're just random thoughts. Why are you so upset? He wrote all sorts of shit in them! Stuff that Vincent put in his head. Accusations. To torment us. To destroy us! Because he couldn't bear that everything was fine. -What is... Rebekka! Michael... Where are my son's letters? I threw them away. I didn't even read them all. I thought... I couldn't have known... You didn't want to know. None of us did. CALLER: SEBASTIAN ONE MISSED CALL A THOUSAND BIRTHDAY KISSES! I LOVE YOU! FROM MELANIE: HAPPY BIRTHDAY Now you're the older one. MESSAGE FROM DARKDREAMERS Hello! Hello! Congratulations! Happy birthday! We're pleased that so many of you came to honor my daughter. I always felt that Rebekka has all of our best qualities. Even her brother's. They were so very close. I know how much we all miss his smile. But we're very lucky. Our daughter isn't just beautiful... Sorry, I'm not quite done. You can... -Dennis would have said it differently. Things aren't always fine. Your son took his own life. My... my brother. He wasn't doing fine. He didn't smile. I want to speak for him so you all understand. But I can't. Because I didn't know him. None of us knew Dennis. Tell them the truth. They deserve it! You deserve it. Which truth, Dennis? Are you done? Yes. My apologies. A day like this is very stressful. Are you trying to destroy our family? He loved you. You're too late. We can't be together, Vincent. Says who? Me. Then why are you here? I don't know why he killed himself. Why did you jump? -I don't know. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how beautiful that shade of crimson is. Only Dennis knew that. We knew it together, but not ... me. Sometimes the darkness is so dark that it shimmers crimson. Sure! He loved you, didn't he? I never thought that one day he would... He stood here looking at me! He took my hand, he looked me in the eyes! He took my hand, told me he loved me, then he just let himself fall. I tried to catch him. But I couldn't. I couldn't. Vincent... He pulled me down too. The only person who can forgive me... ... is you. You're the only one who can do that! I love you. But you can't leave me here alone. Sure, I can.
