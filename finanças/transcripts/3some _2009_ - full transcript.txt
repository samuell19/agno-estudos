PAPER CASTLES Thank you. I think the little bears ruin it. You're watching an adventure movie and suddenly it becomes Sesame Street. They even start singing... It's awful. The guy is a genius. I loved it. And when they take off the bad guy's helmet, his head looks like a hard-boiled egg and he starts crying... Don't tell me, I wanna see it. It's like Sesame Street, only with more puppets. Darth Vader being Luke's father is great. They closed the trilogy with an enigma, a key to keep it going. They're making more? No fucking way. Hi. Hi. Hi. This is Micki's room, our own personal drug dealer. He's never around, but the hash is great. The kitchen is in back. And this is the living room. Welcome. I can't stand Angulo and his fucking nudes. All that crap about capturing the gesture... Then the guy draws all that... bacon! They look like hanging strips of bacon, man. Don't be so picky, just draw better. Right? He draws badly. That's why he's so picky. He's jealous of you. He doesn't draw so badly. It's just that you draw really well, and he notices. Sneakers can't stand him either. I heard he went out for drinks the other night and the guy... went nuts afterthree drinks. Unbearable! - Good hash, huh? - Yeah. You're gonna get hungry. You're a naughty girl, Josita. Don't give her shit. He isn't. Of course not. It's a compliment. - Don't call me Josita. - You don't like it? No. Sneakers is a lunatic. But he's good. I like his work. The other day he glued the skull of a squirrel to that painting he neverfinishes. Where does he get that stuff? I don't know. From the country, I guess. He leaves on weekends and comes back with rocks and stuff. It's really funny. Okay. I'm going out for a minute to do a couple of things. Don't. It always happens to me. I don't know why, but I can't. I'm sorry. Well? How's it going? Lousy, right? Just as I imagined. Don't worry. I can fix this in a flash. Did you plan this? - Yes. - No. You planned this, you bastard. Well, I imagined it might happen. Come on, it's no big deal. Shit, Marcos, you told me. I knew. But you said I should try with different girls. And what did we do? Just that. I did you a favor, admit it. Fine, I did myself one, but I did one for you as well. The three of us are fine, right? We're better than ever. Aren't we? Think about it. Maybe... this is the answer. I take responsibility and you relax. If you overcome your fear of not being able to, which you should, because in all modesty, I always get the job done... someday you're bound to get a hard on. At least, probably. Where do I come in? You're the best part. Because I really like you. More than he does. But without him, you'd never have slept with me. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. I've known for years. Girls always prefer him. That's why I need handsome friends, for their scraps. Yeah, I'm a vulture. So what? It's not my fault, I'd love to be 6-6 and look like a Greek god. But I wasn't so lucky. Though I was endowed with an amazing piece of machinery. Wasn't I? You're such a jerk. I like you too, Jose. Enough that I dared to try with you. Watching you kiss him makes me horny as hell. Hi, sweetie. Everything okay? Maria Jose, time for dinner! - No. - Why not? - Because. - Why not? Because, Jaime. No. It's just crazy. It's not normal. I know that. But we're not normal. We're artists. Fuck you. I want to ask you something. But I want the truth. If you lie to me, you can both go to hell. Scary! I'm serious, Jaime. Have you done this with other girls I know? No. Tell me the truth. Who else would we do it with? They're all totally ugly. What do you take us for? Jose, you're the only one worth it. The only one. Let's get some lunch. My treat. You have a rich boyfriend and a poor one. It was a night in August. I don't remember why, but... I was angry with my friends so I took a walk on the beach. A guy walked up to me... normal-looking... I don't know, he looked okay to me. Thirty, maybe thirty-five. Back then he seemed old to me. "Are you alone?" "Yeah." "Wanna come with me?" He sat down and we talked. "What's your name? Why are you alone on the beach so late?" "Where do you live?" He said he loved skinny-dipping, but it wasn't allowed there. He asked if I'd ever been naked in the sand. What a great feeling it was. He asked if I wanted to try it. We went over behind some rocks, took off our clothes... After a while he came over and started sucking me off. Until I came. Nobody had ever done that to me before, and I liked it. I really liked it. A lot. But I learned one thing. That I don't like men. Because I didn't think of him, or any other guy like him. Nothing happened to me inside. I'm not a homosexual, Jaime. I didn't say you were. Yes, you did. You're always saying it. Telling stories, making jokes, talking about your sister... Damn, because it's true. I have a sister who's a dyke and she's happy. She wasn't before, but she tried it. She's my favorite sister. Fine, but I'm not a homosexual. - You might be, you just... - Jaime. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. It's okay. I have something to say, too. What? I don't come anymore. What do you mean? I mean I don't come. I can't come. I like fucking, I get turned on... But when the moment arrives, I can't. I can't. Yeah, but... you make little noises. You scream and everything. Because I've seen it in movies. I don't make you come. But... I don't get it. Then why do you scream? To please you. So you think it went fine. I always do it. I don't know. It would be weird if I stayed quiet. What a situation! Lucky I found you two, damn... It's like I chose you on purpose. For once I set up something amazing and bam! One is impotent, the other frigid. Fucking wonderful. Just fucking wonderful. It's okay. Really, it's fine. I'll think of something. This really matters to me. First, we'll do two things. I think we need a big bed. We desperately need a big bed. I'm broke, but you, Marquitos, could take care of it. And number two... We've gotta start fucking. Have sex right now. The best any of us has ever had. You can scream if you like, do whatever you want. Let's just fuck, okay? We'll talk later. You paint what you see. Of course. What matters is how you see it. Maybe not. Maybe we should paint what we don't see. A frame of mind. I don't know. Though we don't realize, everything is a self-portrait. Okay, fine. But we paint what we see. Technique is everything. Without it, we can't express anything. You say we paint what we see. What do we do with this one? I don't know, you tell me. Unless you want to copy it... I could really go for sex right now. You look at her, I'll do the rest. You're such a pain. - Josita... - What? Hey, Josita. Don't be mad. You like it? I liked the blue one better. The pink one is better for a hair salon. - Do you llke it? - Yes. In Portugalete, in the Basque Country. A young man wearing jeans and a gray sweater approached the victim from behind... Good lord, they'll never stop. See you later. Married and with two children, was left in a pool of blood and treated by neighbors and paramedics from a nearby hospital... I think you see reality through the drawing and not through the paint. Why don't you work the structure with spots? Almost there? Don't stop... Relax. Don't get nervous. We have all the time in the world. Maybe you do, jerk-off... Did you come? No. But it was great. It's very good, Marcos. It's very good. It's a bit Hopper. Typical stuff, nothing special. That's not what I thought when I saw it. If you look closely, it can remind you of him. But I think it's great. I don't. Yes. No. Marcos... Look. What I see is there because you put it there. The light, almost gloomy, the gray sky... and sadness. That's it. Sadness is everywhere. And it shouldn't be. It's there because that's how you see it. And you know it. That's why I think it's the best thing I've seen in class. Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Jose. If you want, you can have it. When I turn it in, you can keep it. Thanks. Hi. - I bought seafood. - Fantastic! - That smells great. - Hi. Did I mention Jaime doesn't llke cuttlefish? He said he does. Right. I took some things from my mother. Back then, he had written me a poem before we got married. Nobody had ever written a poem about me. At that time, during the break-up, when things were rough, he sent it to my house. I remember reading those first verses. "It's true, my love, it's true." You have brought light into my heart "and the scent of the countryside in springtime into my soul..." Shortly after that we were married. - How are you? - Fine. Hey, what's up? All the sequences have come to an end. Time can't wait... Why did you do that? Because. Because you're my boyfriends. You're in love with me and I'm in love with you. And I don't want people to think you're a thing. That I'm just some jerk driving you around. I'd ratherthey knew the truth. That the three of us are together, that we sleep together and that we love each other. Because I love you guys. I've never said it, but I do. Both of you. A lot. Touch me. Come on, come. Do it for us. Tasty? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Any coffee left? - I think so. What's your plan? I don't know. Hang out with Jaime and the guys. - Are you ready? - You can take that down. Dad, are you taking that painting? It's awful. You know your aunt and uncle love it. Then you shouldn't have painted it. Behave yourself. Anyway... I'd like to meet that Jaime of yours sometime. I've heard so much about him. See you Wednesday. My folks want to meet my boyfriend. So one of you has to come to dinner on Saturday. It's my mom's birthday and she has a dinner every year. It's informal. She said to bring my boyfriend. I told them I had a boyfriend because I'm never at home. You understand, right? It's very simple. One of you two comes, has dinner, and that's it. You can flip a coin. No, no. I'll go. Okay. I told them your name was Jaime. Marcos... A boyfriend can't have two names. Yeah, but you chose his. You're a lot shyer than he is. I didn't think you'd want to. That you'd think it was a drag. I don't care. Come if you want. No, I'll go. I'll bring some pencils and sketch something to please them. No problem. Hi. Come in. Hello. My boyfriend. Jaime and Marcos. I'm Maite. Maria Jose's mother. Hi. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. I was eager to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - For me? - Yes. They're beautiful. Maria Jose, put them in water. Come in the living room. Jaime and his friend are here. So how is art school going? Fine. Maria Jose tells me you're studying various subjects. Painting, color... A little of everything, right? Engraving, painting... - We also study art theory. - That's great. You have to branch out. Truck rentals, for example... Yeah, that's a good business. I have to go to the bathroom. Will you come with me? You have a hard on! How's that fortiming? Let's do it. What about Jaime? Screw Jaime. I can do it, Jose. I know I can. Don't get nervous. Can you feel it? Yes. Benja, concentrate. Nearly finished. - Hi, Maribel. - Hi, sweetie. What's up, Benjamin? Nice having a pretty cousin around, isn't it? Yes. - Here, a postcard for you. - Thank you. Give your mother a kiss for me. From the mail woman. - See you later. - Bye. Maribel talks to me like I'm stupid. It happens all the time. My sister's in Prague with her girlfriend and I have the apartment. Marcos came for a few days. He and his mom fought... Come visit us right now. I don't know if my mom will like that. - Put her on. - Hold on. Mom! You love him more. No. Yes, you do. No. Pass the olive oil. Here. Okay, Marcos. I think we should tell her about the Swiss girl. We owe her that. What Swiss girl? Leave me out of it. You set up the whole thing. The day we spoke on the phone we got it on with a Swiss girl. Both at the same time. To warm up. Right? He was feeling insecure and wanted to try his dick out. He did it all by himself. I didn't like the girl. She was too tall. Very long legs. Really, I didn't like her! Since he speaks German, he started saying things to her, flirting... I barely touched her, but the art school tiger here... And the girl, she was... Pretty "active," wasn't she? You tell me. You fucked her too. I didn't like her much either. Really. I forgive you. It just bugs me, because I've been a saint. I'm getting the paper. You two want anything? Bring cigarettes. We won't tell him about last night. Ever. I love you. I love you too. - Hi. - Hi. You're doing comics now? "Supertrash." You like it? Meet me after class. You need to get some air. This is "The Dog." It's probably one of the most enigmatic of the black paintings. At this moment of his life, Goya has seen hell up close, which might be why this painting is so poignant. It's the work of a man who is frightened. It was heavlly damaged when taken down from the wall where it was painted. For a whlle people even thought it was unfinished. If you look closely, the dog is gazing up towards the upper right corner. An empty space. What is the dog looking at, buried there in the sand? At something in particular, or just into the void? Why do we identify with him? Red onions are better for some sauces. They're juicier, more cheerful, a bit hot. My grandmother ate them raw, in chunks, like bread. She was Andalusian, from Jaen. Like this or chopped more? That's fine. Onions are magic, you know. When cooked right, they disappear. Like Jaime's paintings. Don't be mean. He should draw. He draws very well. I think he knows he does. They say we should accept our limits... We do what we can. I don't know. People do what they can. I don't have any faith anymore. I paint not to think. To keep painting. What about you? You haven't done anything since we came back. I don't feel like it. I have no ideas. I love that this food is black. Now we have to add the cuttlefish. I'll get over it. It's happened to me before. Plenty of times. It's awesome. But maybe we could learn to make something else. No? - You don't like the cuttlefish? - I love it. I'm going to work. See you later. Shall we go to bed? Keep your clothes on. Why? You've done it without me hundreds of times. But you were there. - It was like I wasn't. - But you were. I wasn't in the bathroom at her parents' house. And you'd already tried it before that. Don't try it again. I think he's right. I should start my own school. "Solutions for frigidity, impotence and artistic depression." What a bastard! Strong wine. Jaime, there are more paintings. Are there? Mom. Dad. Come with me, I want you to meet someone. Mom, Dad, these are my best friends. - Jose and Jaime. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Jose, without the accent. Everybody calls me that. - It's weird at first, isn't it? - A bit. Want to see the paintings? Sure, son. There are a lot more paintings here. Yeah, Dad. It's a group exhibition. Do you paint too, Jose? Yes. Marcos and I are classmates. Another! Jose, come on. - This is Jose. Julian. - Hello. - Carmen. - Hi. She's in my same year of school. She's also very talented. I have a lot of faith in Marcos. It's the first time we've shown his work. We've had an incredible amount of interest. I'm very excited. Jaime! Where are you going? Hi. We have to talk. This is ending. We know that, don't we? We've finished our studies. There are no more excuses. No classes, no exams... We can't go on living like before. No more transfers from your old man... You'll have to go home. That's probably what your parents expect you to do. That's why I have an offerto make. You don't have to answer right away. You can think it over. You'd better think it through before answering. I was thinking... we could live together. I'm serious. Very serious. I have money now, and I've got more coming. I was approached last night by some gallery owners. They made me offers. I can sell to whoever pays the most. We can rent a studio or a big house where the three of us can live and work. I can pay for the house and you can cover expenses, or whatever you can. I need you. That's the truth. Maybe I'm being a bit selfish, but with you two around things come easy to me. I've never told you this, but I find being alive very difficult. I'm tired before I do anything. I have to force myself to do things other people do without thinking. The only thing that doesn't happen with is painting. I didn't feel like doing anything. I lived in a tunnel until I met the two of you. I fell in love with you. I love you, Jaime. I know you're in love with Jose. But in spite of it all, I'm still in love with us. You two with me, me with you two. The three of us together. I don't know if you understand. I do. I understand you very well. Because I feel the same way. That's why I thought maybe we could live together. All I'm asking is that we try. I might be saying things I'll regret later, but I might be giving you your only chance to stay together. You might not be able to make it work without me. Aren't you going to answer me? I am answering you. Sometimes I think I could become a great painter. I'll probably fall apart. But if I continue, if I keep painting... I could become a great painter. You're talented. But you have no ambition. You were doing great, but you stopped. You can find another way. But you might not want to. Meanwhile Jaime has ambition... Plenty of it. But he's never been able to see beyond his pencils. He's good at copying dancers but nothing more. He won't get anywhere. He knows it. I'm leaving. Are you going to wait for him? Don't leave me, Jose. Don't leave me.
