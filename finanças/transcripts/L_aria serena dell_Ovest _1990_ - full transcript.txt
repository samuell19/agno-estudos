THE PEACEFUL AIR FROM THE WEST Water... A meadow... Shade... A bath with salts... Wind... Lots of flower... - More? - No. - Listen, if it was a season, what would it be? - Summer. - And if it was a feeling? - A feeling? Joy. A quality? Gentleness. A fault? Something sticky. Music? A waltz. An outfit, a dress? A dress with a fitted bodice and a wide swinging skirt. - Would you like a dress like that? - I've got one. Why don't you tell me what's your job? - What shall I put as a profession? - Put: postman. - Postman? - Yes. - Sure? I'm writing it down. - But yes, that's it. What sort of man do you imagine next to a woman wearing this perfume? Yes, this one. What are you doing for dinner? Excuse me, but was it an interview about perfumes? - Yes. - What "yes"? But what is it all about? They also ask these sort of things in a market research. I don't believe it! - I swear it! - What was the question? - What are you doing for dinner? I'm eating. Olga? Olga? Olga! Horror and indignation about the repression by the Chinese Army. We're inaugurating 3 showrooms this evening. All at the same time. And you have to go to all three? The others have to take care of the May edition. 40 days of mourning for the death of Ayatollah Khomeini... - My car? -I took back yesterday evening. - Good. - What was wrong with it? - Nothing... the sparking plugs. The air filter. He was taken from Teheran hospital, where he died... Reza Cyrus, son of the Shah, deposed 10 years ago by the revolution... - I'll be late this evening. - Ok. - Bye. - Bye. - And in Milan? - There were queues in the bookshops. - Besides, without you, sales have gone down. - Oh, come on. I swear. We never even see the chap who always came at 7 o'clock. And Mario? Happy with university? He's very satisfied. He sends a kiss. But... - But you've moved the Adelphi? - He must be very busy. - Fairly. -I bet you're finally going to get married. Really? Why? They want me to sign, so they can move on with it. - So what? - Can you be sure on the results? - At this point there's very little risk of toxicity. - But there are. Go on, Tobia, keep calm. Besides the marketing guys seem to think the opposite. But isn't the first time a product was despatched before... You are mistaken, it's never happened at this level. To sign before the final analysis, that's real... It should have been done 3 months ago. Go on, you exaggerate. Idiot! We saw it very clearly... After a doubtful beginning, he was helped in his task by Agassi... who would have been in the dressing room already if he hadn't made so many stupid mistakes. "Dilman". "Olga Dilman". How come you have the feeling I'm on my guards? Like that.. Okay, agreed. Let's recapitulate. You live alone, you're a postman, in the evening you often go dancing, but never in the same place. You like meet new people every evening. You never fall in love and you're happy. - I didn't say that. - What? - No, you didn't listen properly. - Pay attention! - I'm sorry. Well, explain to me. Now I'm paying attention. That I chose to live like that. I don't like relations that last, a married life. It is not what I'm looking for, I don't want it. I like to move, dance and that's what I do. I love the town, the night, the music... But don't you long for something? Wouldn't you suddenly like to be somewhere else? No, why? I love this town. The people here... There are so many people. You just have to walk around to meet new people every day. It gives me a sense of freedom to do what I want and not to have to answer to anybody... for what I do. - Do you feel free? - Of course. - How long have you lived in Milan? - Six years. Where did you say you live? Are you always like that? - Didn't you tell me where you live? - No. It's you who are indiscreet and keep asking me. - Do you love all of Milan? - Yes. The fog, the people, the commercials, i Navigli, the fog... the carbon dioxide? That in particular. You have a lovely smile. What's your name? - Laura. - Laura what? - Laura. - You? - I'm Tony. Hello. - Hello. - Do you come here often? - No. - No. - I think I've seen you before. - Uh? - I think I've seen you before. - Really? - What do you do for a living? - Photographer. Good evening, I'd like to ask you something. Can you please tell me if you know Olga Dilman? My name's Noviti. Maybe it's only Olga? She must be 27, thin, pretty... Hallo? Swine. Good evening, excuse the time. My name's Noviti. I'm looking for a young girl called Olga. Dilman. Do you know her? No Olga. All right. Thank you... Miss or Mrs? Can I ask you a question? Do you work? Perfect. Would you let me interview you? No, not right away but... In tennis it's always very important not to look elsewhere... - Hello! - Hello. What a day! I ate so muck filth! Buffets that you can't even imagine. - Have you been in long? - I ate in a restaurant with Marco. How was your day? - Do you want some bicarbonate? - Yes, that would be great. - What match is it? - World championship: Agassi-Bruguera. But haven't you seen it before? Do you know the latest? Thank you. - It seems like I'll be the one to go to Munich again. - For the defiles? Even though I swore that I wouldn't give in this year. Are you coming to bed? Oh, no! Go to hell! You've worked for us for several years now and we appreciate your professional qualities. We thought of you for this new task. Excuse me. Yes? Ask him if he can wait a few minutes. We would like to entrust you with this work from the start, if you intend to take this step, of course. - Of, course. -I don't expect a reply straight away. Not being aware of your plans, but we have a few days. I first need to know if you're as interested as the Cosmos is. Well, let's say... The salary will be suitable to your new position. Yes? Yes. I have to leave you, Noviti. Think about it. Goodbye. Yes. Hallo? Yes, it's me. Good morning, sir. Yes. No, it's not a problem. Okay. - I only want to know what's going on. -I'm leaving. I'm taking 2 weeks off. - In the meantime? - In the meantime what? The analysis. Continue on your own. Wasn't it your idea? It's the only possible solution. Goodbye, Franco. - Tobia, what the matter? - Nothing. - I've never seen you like that. - Exactly. - I don't want to hear about medicine for the moment. - And then? I don't know, we'll see. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Can you turn over a little? - Yes. - Veronica? - Yes? - Have you already been to 312? - No, not yet. Help me with the bed. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Hold on there. - Yes. - Very good. Shit! What's the matter? I can't find something. - Are you coming tomorrow evening? - I don't know if I can. - I knew it. - Why? - You probably don't feel like it. - You are mistaken. I promised to go to the cinema with a friend. - You could go to the cinema another evening. - She's here for 2 days. - Go on, Veronica! - "Go on, Veronica" what? - A friend? - Yes, a friend. - Okay, cheerio. - Cheerio. - You're here already? - How are you? There was a marvellous sun in Siena, I forgot what it meant. - The weather was nice here too. - A big kiss from Carla and Marta. Thank you. - The translation? - I'm a bit behind. What would you think of dining in a nice little restaurant? - Haven't you eaten already? - What do you mean? - I've been waiting for you up to now. - I didn't think I'd find you at home. Did you tell me which train you were taking? Don't look at me like that. You never told me to wait for you for dinner. - Don't you ever feel like spending time together? - Don't be silly! You're a swine! Don't be so childish, please. It's raining. Great point. What about the opponent? Hitting a precise, wrong-footing lob. Where are you going? - What where am I going? - To the Milan office? No, I'm going to the laboratory. Why? I wanted to ask you to do something. I'll do it myself. Cheerio. I'm Madam's husband. Can you hear me? Do you need something? - Do you come here every day? - Yes? No, nothing... I just wanted to change. - Aren't you exaggerating? - No. -I think so. We've already had this discussion. Unfortunately, this isn't Siena. The people are different. It's not so easy. Try to be more flexible. - The dinner was excellent. -It comes from the butcher on the corner. - It's you who're different. - How different. - You've changed. -I assure you that nothing has changed at all. - We've been together for 6 years. - That's it. - That's what? - Must I give up my job and go back to Siena? - No, it's not that. It's because I've come to a dead end. - And I'm not even capable of being a good translator. - That's not true. The first 50 pages were perfect! - I feel like dropping everything. - I'm sure you'll do very good. But why do you always think you're not capable? Don't always dramatize things like that. Today it took me 2 hours to find that upholsterer. I even took the wrong tube. And we've been here 2 months now. See? You exaggerate. It's exactly 6 weeks. - Do I still exist for you? - Don't talk rubbish. Yes? Who is it? No, you are mistaken. I said you're mistaken. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Are you Mrs Dilman? - Not exactly Mrs... - Is that it? - Yes. I was looking for the owner of the agenda. I thought the name was Dilman. You're sure you don't know someone called Olga? Do you need a typewriter? - Olga what did you say? - That's it, I thought it wad Dilman. - And where did you find my name? - On the first page. And if it was a feeling? - Friendship. - A quality? - Sincerity. - A weakness? A weakness... A weakness that's more difficult. Ambiguity. But perhaps that doesn't go with sincerity. - A music? - A perfume is ambiguous because it covers something up. Yes. - What did you say? - A music? A music that would be... Tchaikovsky. Could you give me something more modern? A modern classic... A song by Mina. - Desires, aspirations? - Mhm... - A need to change? Finally, you're happy like that? - Yes. You don't feel that everything's going over our heads without provoking... anything, actually? You easily get used to it, you hardly react to anything. Is still a market research? What are the limits of this market research? Excuse me, but... You reach interplanetary levels I believe... Ask a more precise question and then... Do you feel a certain apathy around you? Listen, I do my work, professionally, with patience, with engagement, and everybody should do the same in his own field. If everyone was like that, I think there would be less... What did you say? Apathy. What do you feel when you hear about a disaster, a catastrophe that happened somewhere in the world? A feeling of rebellion? Do you want to react? Well, if a catastrophe happens in South America, what can I do? - It doesn't affect you? - No, it affects us. It affects me, just as it affects everybody, we regret it, I believe... I don't see... - You say that perhaps someone is responsible? - Yes. On the part of the governments, perhaps... Do you think one's loath to react? That one's reflexes are slow and that one is sometimes even... deaf to certain matters? Listen, it's an easy... position. Sincerely, you think can solve the problems in South America or China, by selling perfumes? I've called practically all Milan. - Did you describe her well? - Yes... If they didn't hang up... which nearly always happened. - Then I let this Dilman have it. - Did she know her? I think she knew her, her name was in the agenda. - Hi, Livio. - Hi! Cute... An odd type. I left it with her. - Did you interview her? - No, but I asked her. That would surprise me. You're sick! What if her name is not Olga? - It's going to be a permanent job. - Still for the same firm? - Director of the new branch here in Milan. - How much are you getting? - 4000, 5000 francs. - Fantastic! What am I going to do? I can't spend my whole life saying I'd like to do one thing and then do something else. You're in the same situation as many others. - Great. -I don't have the impression that you don't like it. No... Only the interviews don't have much to do with ethnology. - What do you want me to say? - I know, I know... Then go. Go to San Blas, or then accept the job, save some money, and in 2 years go and do this research about the Cunas. In 2 years? I don't even know if there will still be Cunas at San Blas. - Perhaps it will be full of Japanese tourists. - Go on, Cesare! Excuse me for a moment. Olga! Olga! Excuse me. - Are you really going? - Yes. - You could make an exception. - No, I prefer it like that. What's this mystery? You have a husband waiting for you? No, no mystery. Bye. Stay here! Don't leave me alone. - That is enough? - Fuck off! - You just stay for 3 hours. - Fuck off! - It's not enough? The dramatic situation in China worries the rest of the world. The British government has decided to congeal the treaty... What do you keep on looking at? What about going out to dinner? Do you realise what sort of day's waiting for me and the evening? Okay... okay... You talk about our annual dinner? Does it have to be this evening? - Tobia, what's happening? - Nothing. Nothing? - Mrs. Vilman? - Yes... Dilman, actually. Oh, I'm sorry. Delighted. Ozzola. Sit down. - Can I ask you a question? - Of course. Why have you only finished half the translation? Someone died in my family, my mother. Here's 8398009. I'm not in at the moment. I'm Irene Dilman. I'll call back. Hallo? - What's the matter? - I was waiting for you. Irene, I must talk to you. - I'm listening. - Can I take this off? I saw Balli today. He asked me if your mother was better and if you were back from Siena. Can you explain to me? I wouldn't have finished the translation on time. Was it necessary to make up such a childish story? - You're 33 years old, not 16! - And you? And him? Did he have to ask you if what I says was true? He didn't ask me anything. I did introduce you to Balli, didn't I? Say what you're worried about. What Balli would think! Say it! It's you I'm worried about. - Your career could suffer! - Don't talk rubbish! - Let's try to talk like adults. - And you're the adult?! Let's try to keep calm. And once we're calm, adult, reasonable, what then? - Then I can't stand you! - Me neither. Pay attention, idiot! Fuck you... What's the matter, you swine? Better? I don't eat last night. Do you want a chocolate? - Shall I call the office to let them know? - No, I've already called. - Thanks, don't worry. - Is this agenda yours? - No. Listen... Tell me exactly what happened. I know they stuck a knife in your stomach... But who? One doesn't go out on the street to stab someone else. - That's what I also thought. - Are you in pain? - No. Do you need anything? If you want I can try to leave tomorrow with the 7:40 plane. Don't worry, really. I come out the day after tomorrow. - I'll call as soon as I reach Munich. - You can leave tranquil. No, I'm not leaving tranquil, it annoys me! Just today... What where you doing near the park? Taking a walk. Taking a walk, Clara. I know it's difficult for you to understand, but I need it. I was in the Milan office... I've brought you a suit. Well, won't you tell me what happened? But see how disturbed you look. Bad news? If I tell you, it will seem more important than necessary. As you wish. I met a son of a bitch. I'm so stupid that it makes me sick. - And all because... - Come in. Excuse me. I found this on the bedside table in 402. Thank you. Do you know if my husband, Angeli, comes out the day after tomorrow? - The doctor will be here this evening towards 6. - Yes, okay. - Thanks. - Bye. The visit are finished. All visitors must leave the wards. Good evening. The agenda that you're found... was it here when you arrived? - Do you know who it belongs to? - It's mine. I lost it a week ago. It wasn't here yesterday. Is it really yours? Are you sure? The blood I imagine that's yours. - I found it. A woman lost it in the street. - Who? I don't know her. I picked it up to give it back to her. Don't look at me like that. That's all... Then I got stabbed. Why did you tell your wife you knew nothing about it? I said that it wasn't mine. It's the true. - Veronica, we're waiting. - I'm coming. - Sorry, madam, I thought the room was vacant. - No, come in. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. - Madam, I have to clean the bathroom. - Yes. - Are you also here for the congress? - Excuse me? - Are you also here for the congress? - Yes. Are you still angry with me? No, but I don't quite believe you. You have to take this. I don't know what to say, it's true. Why should I lie to you? Look. A WALK ALONG THE PARK ENDS UP IN A STAB What's the matter? Don't you feel well? Miss, has something happened? No, nothing. SUICIDE IN THE BATHTUB A LOVE DECEPTION AT THE ROOT OF THE DESPERATE ACT Number AS. Number AS... Number AS 77533. 77533. Number AS 77... 533. Eh, dear Olga! - What's the matter? Are you crazy? - Where have you been all day? I'm just back from Bologna, why? - I won 80 millions. - Who? In the lottery. I won! Ticket number AS 77533. - What 80 millions? - I swear it! - Shit! - Guess what I'm going to do? - You're leaving? - Come on, we'll celebrate. Nobody there? Madam? Hello? Marta, how are you? I'm fine and you? What, where am I? In a public phone box. Mario? When did he call you? Yes. I left, so what? I don't give a damn about Mario. If you keep the well... Stop telling me to think it over. I really have enough! Veronica! - Good morning. - Good morning. I wanted to invite to dinner... if you feel like it. - How you did know I was here? - I looked for you at the hospital. And as I ruined your agenda, I wanted to make up for it. Dinner at this time? No, at dinner time. - I don't recognize you, why did you do that? - So... Don't you like it? Yes. DON'T WORRY, IT'S ME WHO TOOK YOUR BELOVED TYPEWRITER DON'T LOOK FOR ME Excuse me? - But are you Veronica? - Yes. - Do you remember me? You once gave me injections. - Of course. - Are you better now? - Yes, yes, thank you. - You are very pretty with blond hair. - Thank you. - We could have a drink together. - I'm in a hurry, I'm sorry. - Goodbye. - Do you still have the same phone number? Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It's the better than a lot of other jobs, isn't it? - I don't know, why? - At least it's useful for something. There are a lot of people who do jobs and if they didn't do them, it would be even better. A nurse is different: that's useful. - What else do you do? - That depends. When I work at night, I sleep all afternoon. Still this serious face? - And your wife... what did you do with her? - She left for work. - "When the cat is away, the mice will play". - That's it. - When are you going back to work? - I don't know if I'll go back. - Why? - I don't know, I had enough. You like dancing, don't you? No. Too bad. That wouldn't be good for your convalescence to dance. Ah... You underestimate me. Do you think I can take them? What take them? Take theme away? Why not? It's done. Hello. Who? One moment. Veronica? Telephone. Hello? Hello, Doctor Tobia. Gladly. The only one problem is come out at 10:00 o'clock. Are you sure? What shall we see? Good evening. Someone spent a stressed night in Pechino. Because the military control doesn't permit any civil's movement. Hundreds of tanks keep busy midtown at every cross street while soldiers in the truck, are ready to approach. According to the diplomatic corps, the deployments of the force has more the task to discourage a work over of the rebels than to face disarmed civils. The military command of Peking ordered the clearing out of some skyscrapers of the business centre, where are located the major western companies, and Chinese Company. From time to time I translated some letters. But my work was the bookshop, I took care of that and so... - I believe it's different for a woman. - What? The bonus which comes from work in itself isn't enough. To you, one would say yes. Because of that... I don't know why I'm telling you all this. - Is it the first time you do an interview of this kind? - Yes. Actually I thought it was something quite different. Yes... If you don't want to answer some questions, you don't have to. Okay. Can I switch it off? Do you happen to get afraid? - Of What? -In general... The Future, for example. The ozone hole, pollution, atomic weapons, don't frighten you? - Are you such a pessimist? - What do you say? I don't think the situation's that bad. And even, if it is there's no need to think about you. What could one do? I don't believe I am... afraid of all that: it's too big. It's too abstract. - You know that it's the law? - I don't like seat belts. Okay. - What time do you have to be at work tomorrow? - At half past six. - Ah... - Why? - Then we can't do much crazy things. - Did you want to do crazy things? - Do you ever feel like acting crazy? Rob a bank, go and have a coffee in New York? - Go naked onto the street. -I didn't expect that from you, Doctor Tobia. Eh, I know, I know. If I were to do something crazy, I'd go to Paris. To the Louvre, to look at a picture. I didn't expect that of you... nurse Veronica. Life is full of surprises. - I watch very little. - Do you like commercials? Commercials? I don't care. They're colourful. And I your desires in all that? - What? - Can you know where they go, which ones They are? Well, I hope so. Are all market research interviews like this? No, we've got of the track of the research. My desires... there are so many. Isn't there a special one that you follow from time to time? To be happy. - What do you do for that? - What I do for that? I do what everyone else does. And you, what do you do? - I'm leaving soon. - And where are you going? To San Blas, a small archipelago near Panama. To do some more market research? - An ethnological research, actually. - What about? About the Cunas, the people from there. And why are you doing market research? To live. - You studied ethnology? - Yes, I studied ethnology at college. - And you can't live from ethnology? - It's very difficult. - It won't be easy, Noviti. - No, sure. Besides it's a long time since you completed your studies. - There are new publications. - Well, yes... - I've read something. - I don't want to discourage you. But if your immediate aim is publication, it's not feasible, but surely is not so easy. If on the contrary your interest goes deeper, I'd be happy to welcome you in the institute. But when do you think I should leave? There you're asking a bit much. The research which you intend to do isn't a thing which can be improvised. To work 5 or 6 months on the field, the organisation of the research plan, paperwork, visas, it must all be carefully prepared. It will take some time. Are you sure you want to continue your studies on the Cunas? - But of course. Why? - Excuse me, it's for you. Excuse me, Noviti. Hello. Hi, Doctor Tobia. I get out a half past three. Why? To Paris? Are you crazy?! It's a joke, isn't it? I don't know what to say. Say nothing. Say yes, that's all. Alright, well meet a 5 o'clock at the airport? Okay? Two or three days... We'll find an excuse. We'll call the hospital tomorrow and say you've got the flu. It's not that easy. Of course I want to come. Okay, I'll come. I'll meet you there. At 5 o'clock. See you soon. I always have to take the first step, don't I? But can't you understand? Do you think I was worried? Can't we go out? Why did you make me come here? To give you that. For your friend Balli with my greetings. - Are you starting again? - No, I don't intend to. In any case, I'm leaving this hotel. - Where will you go? - With friends. Goodbye. Hello... at last! You're back home? I tried to call you, but you were never home. - How's your wound? - Okay. It's almost cured. But... what are you wearing? I've kept my evening free for our dinner. Are you listening? - Ah, yes... - Well, won't you make a reservation? - Yes. But you'll change, won't you? - Hi! - Hi! I was passing by and I asked myself how the interview went. Very well. - Am I disturbing you? - No, not at all. - Are you about to leave? - No, I took some washing from the laundry. - But you, have you decided when you're leaving? - Yes... soon. Soon... I'm sorry. This is 8398009. I'm not at the moment. Leave a message, I'll call you after. Speak after beep. Hello, this is Cosmos speaking. I have a message for Mr. Noviti. Mrs Jeggi would like to see you as soon as possible. She would like you to make an appointment for Wednesday at 10:30. She would like you to call and confirm it. Goodbye. What are you doing? Are you sleeping here? Blond suits you well. It's of no use. What? It's always the same shit! - Veronica, what's happening? - Nothing but shit happens to me. What can you do to make something nice happen? Do you know? - Veronica, are you crazy? - Yes, I'm crazy, so what? Veronica, I really have to go. Calm down. See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. In times where reality is faster than expectations the caution at the Berlin meeting with the most four world power nation look like a bit restrained. The breakdown of the wall, happened a month ago, changed the story course, but it didn't wipe it off. Remainder of suspects are still palpable and the ambassadors don't - Where? - Back there, on the right, in the jug. - It looks like milk. - It's yoghourt. East Europe is always pushed at West by a reforming wind. In Czechoslovakia events are coming one after the others... - I was cold last night. - Yes? - Not you? - No. Hello? I'd like to speak to Professor Apati. Can you put me through? Thanks. Mario? Hello. Well. I've got a meeting at 8.30, I can't find the results of the scan. Do you know where they are? Oh, there? Yes, okay. Yes, very well. He's kicking me. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. That's it. Thanks a lot. - Do you want something else? - I take the chair. - Yes. - Have you finished? - Yes. - Bye. - See you tomorrow.
