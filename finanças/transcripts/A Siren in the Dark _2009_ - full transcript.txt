He doesn't want to talk to you. Listen you little shit. Just because you're fucking my-- Danny, what happened? Are you all right? I've been worried about you. Why didn't you call? What happened? Something's wrong. Do you want Rebecca and I to come get you? Promise you won't stop anywhere? Hello? Goddamn, Danny. You'd better come straight here. I mean it. I'll be waiting. I love you. I love you. OK. OK, you, too. Bye. What? There's a storm on the way. I've made my decision. I want to stay here with you. What about--? Fuck him. I hope he went off a cliff and died. I'm not going to let anyone treat me the way he did again. It's just when I'm with you, I feel so much stronger, like I can do anything. I know we've only been together for a couple days-- Every time I look at you, which is-- Hello? Now I want to be a part of you. Oh, shit! You will be. You will be. A Siren in the Dark So you got the lights, the sirens, the whole bit. You happy now, miss? Thank you, Officer Ibanez. Cameron. Please just call me Cameron. - Only if you call me Ariel. -All right, Ariel. So, Cameron, did you want to come up for a while and have a cup of coffee? A cup of coffee? And a doughnut. I know how you cops love your coffee and doughnuts. I'm not big on either. Well, I'm sure if we put our heads together we can come up with something you might enjoy. Oh, come on. What do you think I am? I can assure you my intentions are pure and just gesture of appreciation for being in the right place at my misfortunate wrong time. You're something else. You know that? Just a girl who knows what she wants. And like my namesake, I always seem to want what I can't have. Namesake? "The Little Mermaid"? I see, but didn't she always get what she wanted? By pretending to be who she wasn't. We all have to pretend sometimes, you know, to get what we really want. I couldn't agree with you more. So, Ariel, do you have a thing-a-ma-bob? Upstairs. Battery operated. Stop it. Stop! Stop it! Get off me! I think I best say good night. You're not even going to walk me upstairs? I mean, didn't you just say you're out looking for a murderer? A missing person with probably foul play. Foul play, shit. Fuck, whatever. I can't believe this. Why did you even stop to pick me up? Why didn't you just leave me on the side of the fucking road? I mean, what kind of cop would refuse to just, like-- Ariel. Fuck, dude, what the-- Ariel, I'll go upstairs and check it out. Thank you. You don't like women very much, do you? Or is it just me? Why do you say that? I didn't say anything. You know what I think? Besides being a little weird, I think our handsome Officer Ibanez just might be gay. Six hours earlier. Shot! I'm way ahead of you. Bottoms up. You're bottom's always up. You're bottom's always up, bitch. Bullshit. There's always a bitch in every relationship, and the last time I checked it sure as shit wasn't me. Last time I looked, it wasn't me, either. Well, the one with the biggest dick gets to choose who the bitch is, so I pick you. Bullshit. My dick is bigger than yours. Fuck you. Fuck me? Prove it. Fine. Bring it on. You, first. No, you go. We both go on the count of three. OK. Ready? One, two, three. Shit. OK, well not by much. So you admit, you're the bitch. By a half an inch. A good inch at least. You need glasses. I need another drink. Cheers. Bitch. Welcome to Fantasy Fitness. Working out never got you this hard. PJ. Cameron. What the hell's going on in here? Why the hell are you home so early? I skipped my meeting. You're never skip your meetings. Well, I just did. Who's that? My friend Andi. What's he doing with that cat? Wishing it was me. All right. I'm too tired for this. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Take it in your own room. Lets go. Come on. But you have all the liquor. Which you're too young to drink. Same to you, buddy. You're just jealous because my sweet little ass gets laid. - Say good night, PJ. - Good night, PJ. What's wrong? Another one of your headaches? Yeah, it's a bad one. Do you want me to make you some tea? No. It looks like you're busy. But thanks. You're welcome. Good night. Night. Who was that? That's my brother. - That was your brother? -Yeah. How come he's ail Caucasian and you're this little Asian bitch? Fuck you. What the fuck are you? Not a bitch. Hello? Hello? Who is this? So really, how come your brother's white? I was adopted when I was a baby. Why don't you live with your parents? They died in a car crash when I was 12. He raised me ever since. All by himself? Yep. Wow. He was only 19. That's a lot of responsibility for a 19-year-old. What kind of meeting was he not supposed to miss? It's called none. None? Does that stand for something? Yeah. None of your goddamn business. Come on. Was it an AA meeting? Is he an alcoholic or something? A substance abuser? They say if you want free drugs, just become a rock star or cop. If I tell you, you promise not to say anything? I promise. He voluntarily entered himself into a rehabilitation program three years ago. For what? Swear you won't say a word? I swear. Cameron had sex with a 10-year-old girl. Oh, shit. PI know it sounds bad, but he himself was only 11 at the time. And her father made him do it while he videotaped. Oh, shit. As he got older, he was so afraid of his sexual desires, that he just kept to himself. He never went out on a date. He hasn't even kissed a girl. Nothing. What is he afraid of? I don't know. Wow. That's a lot of weight to carry around. No wonder he looked so stressed. I love my brother. He's one of the most decent men I know. How are you feeling? Worse. That feels good. Don't get a hard-on. What are you doing here anyways? Aren't you supposed to be with your friend? I was worried about you. Something's happening tonight, isn't it? Why you say that? I can feel it in your neck and shoulders. You always get tied up when we're about to have visitors. Yeah, you're probably right. Tonight's going to be a long night. I'll make sure I won't-- Hello? Hello? Yes, I can her you. Yes, I understand. I'll set up right away. I need more time. An hour? Good. You will be here, won't you? Hello? Hello? This is Cameron. We made contact. Would you dim the lights, please? Thank you. July 17, 2008. This is Cameron Ibanez. And I'm here with Daniel Pennington who has come on his own accord to help out with the investigation into disappearance of Kevin J McKendrick. Are you ready to begin? It's on record that you and Kevin were once lovers. You could say that. It is also on record that your relationship was often strained, and that your infidelities and your previous relationship with his sister Rebecca caused tension in the home. I met Kevin through Rebbeca. She and I broke it off before I began a relationship with him. So you went from one to the other, all the while living in the same house. That's right. There was also a younger sister, an aspiring young model, Dakota. Did you also have sexual relations with her? No. Tell us what happened the day you left the house the day Dakota was murdered. She died from a cocaine overdose. Which you supplied her, and which was later found to be laced with poison. Now can you tell us how that happened and who was it really meant for? The poison was meant for me. Why was that? Oddly enough, because I like to watch. I'm not sure I understand. Sometimes I'd bring people over to the house for the mere purpose of observation. I would ask them to do things. You mean sexually? Sometimes but not always. My main purpose was, as I said, just to observe. The teen girls were the easiest. They were more susceptible to suggestion. I think just because it made them feel grown up. How did it make you feel? Powerful. My favorite times were with a boy named Casey. He was new to the neighborhood. He was slightly retarded but also willing. What made him most exciting was that Casey had a relationship with his older brother that one would call special. You mean, Troy Mitchell? Yes. They had a strong bond? You could call it that. Casey and Troy would do everything together. And I do mean everything. They both had different fathers, but that didn't take away the pleasure of watching them in action. They had a sister. Mary. Was she involved in any of this? I'd rather not talk about it. I see. It was a game for us, Kevin and me. Kevin endorsed this type of activity? He more or less just went along with it. But it was Kevin who first met Troy. Through Troy I met Casey. And it was he who caused the death of Dakota. You see, Troy was a dealer. We became friends and started doing business together. This didn't sit well with Casey. He got jealous, not because he wanted to be with me, but because he didn't want to share his brother. So the solution to the problem was dumping the rat poison into my supply-- Only Dakota got it first. Was It Casey who killed his step-brother and sister? Who can say? Was Kevin involved in any of the drug deals? No, Kevin was a run-of-the-mill alcoholic. He would never use, at least not until he met-- Until he met who? Our friend. We first met right after I found Dakota dead. I ran out of the house, got into my car, and went driving up into the hills. Drove up to a place called Beak's on Road. Black Star Canyon. Yeah. Stopped at a dive restaurant that really had no business being there. Good evening and welcome. A lady told me about a shortcut down the other side of the hill leading into the Inland Empire. That's when I saw him. He was standing beside his broken-down car. So I stopped to pick him up. Seems almost a joke now, but I picked him up with the intent of robbing him. Did you succeed? You can't fucking steal from the devil. What was his name? Joshua. Danny Pennington. Good to meet you, Danny Pennington. And perfect timing, I might add. I wasn't looking forward to the long walk. When you going to get back your car? I don't know. I just shelled out $300 out of thanks. That's fucked up. Oh, well, what are you going to do? I tell you what I'd do. I'd get my money back from that fucker's ass. I'd probably take his car. Really need it out here in the middle of butt-fucking Egypt. I like living out in the sticks. At night, you can actually go outside and see the stars. How exciting. Depends on who you're with. You live out here all by yourself? I live with my two animals-- my horse Price William and my friend Ozzie. Ozzie? My pet rooster. What's so funny? Must be lonelier out here than I thought. I mean, a rooster? Isn't that a poor substitute for basic human needs? I find them very comforting. Well, yeah, during the day. But how comforting can they be during the night? To tell you the truth, I can't say much for my horse William, but you'd be surprised what a nice cock will attract. I stopped to take advantage of him. I should have just kept going. Stop it. You're acting like a goddamn schoolgirl. Fuck it. It's like I need a fucking root canal. Wait. Please don't go. Danny, wait. Wait. You didn't do anything wrong. It's just a game. I know. I was just-- so scared. I mean, everything happened so fast. I really should be going. My friend was expecting me hours ago. Well, you don't have to stay long. Please, just let me make it up to you. It gets so lonely up here. I thought you liked being alone. I like being with you. You don't even know me. I want to. Please, Danny. Give me another chance. You got anything to eat? Why are you listening to this shit? I told you. I don't get radio reception up here. All I have is a bunch of old records. - What's wrong? - Stuffed. Well, there's a lot of food left. You can do better than that. I can't eat another bite. Look at me. I'm a fat, fucking pig. Shut up. You look great and you know it. You should at least eat your veggies. You're still a growing boy. I stopped growing a long time ago. I've noticed. Fuck, bitch. That all you ever think about? Your daddy give you enough attention? Oh, I thought you were my daddy. You're fucking hard, you know that? Look at that? What? You haven't touched a thing. I'm not hungry. You made all this for me? Remember that girl that you met at the restaurant? The one who said it's OK to trespass on private property? She's the owner of this whole goddamn place. She's always sending little care packages with enough food to feed an army. More than I can ever eat. - You want some? -No. Wanna fuck? I know. I know. Your friend was expecting you hours ago. Why don't you just call the little bitch and tell him something came up? You'll see him tomorrow. Tell him you'll eat him out for lunch. Lunch? Good a time to eat as any. You want me to stay the night, don't you? I promise not to act like a goddamn schoolgirl. Here I come. Danny? I'd do anything for you, Danny. I'd do anything. Danny. Danny? Are you having a good time? Danny. Are you having a good time? Excuse me. Excuse me. What are you doing here? You forgot something. - If it's about your tip-- -If it's about your tip-- It's nothing like that. I'm just really short on cash right now. It's nothing like that. Why'd you come out here? You forgot your mint. You followed me out here just to give me a mint? And this. On-- on the back. You want to hook up with me? What time you getting off? In an hour. That's 59 more minutes than I've got. How about we get in the car right now. See what happens. - What's wrong? -Nothing. Come here. What you got hiding under there? Nice little titties. You're not going to look like that forever. Better use it while you got it. I'm only 16. You're hurting me. Come on. Come on. Get out. Dakota? They had a sis-- Mary. - Was she involved in any of this? - Please don't tell my brothers. I'd rather not talk about it. - Through Troy I met Casey. - Please. And it was he who caused the death of Dakota. Dakota. Dakota? I don't know what happened. Fuck. What'd you do? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I love her. I love her. Dakota, wake up. Can you open your eyes? Shit. I loved her. Why did you leave her, Danny? Why did you leave me? Bye, Danny. - Where you goin'? - Bye, Danny. Casey's calling me. Baby, don't go. Bye. He's going to kill you. Will somebody answer the goddamn phone? Hello? Is Kevin there? He's not here. Put him on the phone, Rebecca. He doesn't want to talk to you. Just put him on the goddamn phone. Listen, you little shit, just because you're fucking my- Danny, what happened? Are you all right? I've been worried about you. Why didn't you call? I'm stuck in the middle of butt-fucking Egypt. Couldn't get to a phone until now. What happened? I can't talk right now. I'll explain everything later. Something's wrong. Do you want Rebecca and I to come get you? No. Just chill, all right? Leave that bitch out of this. All right. Promise me you won't stop anywhere? Hello? Goddamn it, Danny, you better come straight here. I mean it. All right. Fuck. Have you heard from Dakota? We've been looking for her everywhere. I haven't seen her. I'll be waiting. I love you. Oh, shit. I love you. I have a view. OK. OK, you, too. Bye. What? What? There's a storm on the way. Shit. Oh, baby. Come to papa. Fuck. Yeah? Step out of the car, please. What? Step out of the car, please. -Officer-- - I'm not a police officer. What do you want then? Who the fuck are you? You're the chick from the restaurant. Yeah, that's right. The chick from the restaurant. Janice Gunderson at your service. What the fuck is your problem? You scared the shit out of me out here. I'm not the one with the problem, it seems. It's almost 2 o'clock in the morning. You already made good of the shortcut that I told you about. You must have really liked him. Did you fuck him? What? Joshua. Did you fuck him? Or did you just stop by for souvenirs? I don't have to listen to this shit. You try to be nice to someone and this is how they repay you. If I find that you've laid one finger on him-- Hey, I didn't force him to do anything. The bitch practically begged for it. And that's your payment, I suppose. I really hope you were worth it. Fuck it. Take everything. Who needs it? Obviously you do. And now I have something to give to you. - Save it for next time, bitch. - Watch your manners, fuck. That was my second big mistake. Aw, shit. Like the first. I should have just got in my car and just kept on going. I appreciate you calling him and having him help with the investigation. I really do. But I fail to see how any of this matters. I don't care what happened to him. What happened to my brother? Kevin knew how I used to drive through those hills whenever I needed to sort things out. A few nights later, when I didn't return, he came looking for me. That's when he met Joshua. How does he know? What happened to Kevin? They prey on your weaknesses and cater to your desires? They? What happened to me happened to all of us. This is bullshit. How do you know what happened to my brother? They prey on your weaknesses. Were you there? And cater to your desires. I said, where you there? Inaudible................... You sure do like your drink, don't you? It's been a hell of a night. Tell me about it. You know, you might be more comfortable sleeping on the couch. I'm fine here. Thanks. Suit yourself. I'm going to take a shower and then turn in. If you need anything, just make yourself at home. Thank you. Kevin, don't worry. We'll find that boyfriend of yours. Although from what you told me, I think you'd be better off without him. Well, good night. Joshua? Good night. Kevin, is anything wrong? You told me if there's anything I needed-- Ow! You scared me, you little bitch. That hurts. You'll get over it. Morning. Morning, my ass. It's 11 o'clock. - I didn't get much sleep last night. -Neither did I, thanks to you. But I still managed to get up early, ride my horse, pick flowers from my garden, and make breakfast. Sit down. Breakfast? I'm not used to eating before noon. Cock crows early around here, honey. Stays up pretty late, too. I didn't hear any complaints. Joshua, I'm still full from last night. You're trying to make me fat, aren't you? What are you talking about? Yes, you are. You're going to make me big and fat. And then you're not going to want me anymore. Quiet. Just eat. It's good. You're a good cook. Juice? - Any...? -Already mixed. I thought your lines were down. They must have fixed them. I'll be right back. Hello? Mm, hello? Who's this? -Who's this? -I'm sorry to bother you. I've been frantically searching for my brother, and I was hoping you could help me. His name is Kevin. Kevin McKendrick. I don't know anyone by that name. Who is this? How did you get this number? It's unlisted. I traced a phone call made from your home. Well, that's not possible. This is a secured line. My boyfriend works for the phone company. Rebecca, was it the right number? He was able to trace the call back to this number. Well, was it him? Shh. Well, that can't be. His boyfriend must have called there from your phone. I don't know what you're talking about. No one's been here. I was thinking you might be a friend of his. His name is Danny, Danny Pennington. My brother went searching for him a few nights ago when he didn't come home. And now they're both missing. I'm sorry. I really wish I could help. But I think your mistaken. I live here alone. No one's been here. Are you sure? Could someone have come in when you weren't there? No, that's not possible. I live in a very remote area. Listen, I have to go now. I'm sorry about your brother. Wait! Bucky. Joshua? Oh, you scared me. Is everything all right? Who was that? Just a wrong number. Bucky, please. Is that all you think about? I'm sorry. - Wasn't him, huh? - Like you really give a shit. Hey, I care. You only care about one thing. You've already made it clear that's all I'm good for in the relationship anyway. You're barely even good for that. Dakota didn't feel that way. My little sister had smaller expectations. Are you sure you're OK? You're all flushed. I'm fine. Come on. Why don't you help me with the dishes? But you haven't used them yet. Not hungry. - You didn't eat last night either. -I'm on a special diet. What? Air? I never thanked I coming to my rescue the other night. I can't believe my radiator just blew up like that. I mean, I just had it fixed. You know, I would never have even seen you if it weren't for the girl I ran into. Girl? Yeah, I met her when I stopped to eat at that place I was telling you about. Good evening and welcome. Table for one? We must have talked for a good hour or so. I figured she was the owner. She asked me what I was doing there and where I was headed. That's when she told me about the shortcut. She scribbled the directions on a matchbook. What was the name of the restaurant? The Harvest. Janice Gunderson. The who? The girl you met at the restaurant-- landowner, restaurateur, and a lousy mechanic. If she was half as good at fixing cars as she was at poking around other people's business. I'm sure she knows just about everything about you now. Not everything. There. Now it's straight. It's been bugging me since we first met. Danny would never pay attention to things like that. He barely paid attention to me at all. Well, you don't have to worry about him anymore, do you? The little fucker. Honey, what's wrong? Honey, you're still not thinking about that asshole? Kevin? I'm leaving in the morning. I just need to find out what happened. You know if you go, you'll never come back. I will. I promise. Even if you're telling the truth, you know he won't let you. When he finds out about us-- He won't. This is fucking bullshit. Joshua. Don't be mad. Please? Goddamn it. Did you drink everything? I don't want to fight. I love you. Right. It'll just be for a couple of days. A couple of days. I need to pick up my shit anyways. You don't need to pick up anything. We'll buy whatever you need. I just need to know he's OK. I just need closure. After everything he's done, he's all I have left. No one understands him the way I do. I think I understand him. I've known half a dozen guys like him. What I can't understand is guys like you who don't think they deserve better. He's had a hard life. Fuck him. So have we. - Where are you going? - I'm going to change my shirt. We're still going out, aren't we? We can stay in if you'd like. I'm sorry, but I don't think I'd be very good company right now. Joshua. What are you doing now? What does it look like? You do too much of that shit. You use it like it's candy. And what have you been drinking all day? At least it's legal. So's sticking a gerbil up your ass. It still ends up shit. Get over here. Try some of this. No, thanks. Pot is my limit. Come on. It's not going to hurt you. It'll take the edge off the evening. Believe me, you and I need it. -What do I do? -Just breathe fast. It burns. I felt it going into my throat. It's supposed to. - Now, quick, do the other side. -No. It tastes like aspirin. I need something to drink. Don't be a baby. See? That wasn't that bad. In a few minutes, you'll be one with the universe. That's 'cause I'll be fucking dead. Just relax. Here you go, big baby. Holding out on me? Joshua? I'm sorry. Let's not fight anymore, OK? I don't want to fight. Promise me you'll come back. You couldn't keep me away. Promise me. I promise. Now let's go get shit-faced. Are you OK? Mm. I'm cool. Mm. Better. I'm good-- It's OK. Get it all out. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I ruined your night. I must have drinked too much. You think? I'm pretty fucked up. Well, believe it or not, I've seen worse. Come on. Let's get you inside. I, uh, didn't mean to spoil your evening. I think you should brush your teeth first. Right. I got to get some things out of the car. I'll be right back. When you're done, come up to the room. I'll be waiting for you. Uh! - You're getting careless. - I was hungry. - You used to be. - I was hungry. Hungry. I'm on a special diet. What? Air? - Look at that. - What? You haven't touched a thing. I'm not hungry. He's fascinatingly delicious. Well, he's mine. Keep your hands off of him. I mean it. What happened to Danny? I was going to ask you the same. Slipped right under your powdered little nose. - You're getting careless. -I was hungry. You used to be. You're never going to find anyone as good as I am. I'm the best. You were. He made a phone call, Joshua. Who the fuck gave you permission to get a phone? I sure as shit didn't. What the hell is this? I screw up once and you're ready to give up on me? Cut me a break. You know I can handle this. I'll be more careful. Goddamn it, Janice. What the fuck else do you want me to say? I want you to say you'll stay focused and lay off the fucking powder. All right. OK. I said I'd take care of it. Good. Don't forget who takes care of you. How you feeling? Better. What's that? Something to help you relax. -What is it? -Just drink it. What's wrong? Don't you trust me? Good. You might start to feel dizzy. Just close your eyes and let it put you to sleep. Maybe I don't want to be put to sleep. You have a long drive in the morning. You need your rest. I really wish you wouldn't go. I know, but I've already made my decision. You've got four hours to change it, though. Danny. Fuck, Danny. Dakota? Dakota? Wake up. Wake up. No. Why did you just leave her? You wouldn't just leave. Damn you! You fucking asshole! Don't touch me! Oh! Get off me! Stop it! Stop it! Don't you fucking touch me! What's happening to me? Hold me! I don't want to look like this. Give me a chance to help you. I'll do anything. Kevin. Kevin. Hit me! What? Hit me! No. Hit me! Inaudible........................ They prey on your weaknesses and cater to your desires. This is fucking bullshit. Prey on your weaknesses and cater to your desires. What happened to Kevin? This is fucking bullshit. He made me stronger. And we all played the game. What happened to my fucking brother? The same thing that happened to me. Just where the hell do you think you're going? Home. What? Your mother waiting to tuck you in? Sorry, Daniel, but your bad-boy charm's not going to get you out of this one. You almost got away with it. Clean break. All you had to do was start the fucking car and splitsville. But you couldn't do it, could you? The temptation got the better of you. God bless the young and undisciplined. Never once do they think about the consequences, the hard work, relationships. Fuck, you're never even heard of those words. You boys are all alike, always looking for the quick fix, the shortcut. Makes what I do almost unrewarding. Almost. "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble death heaven with my bootless cries and look upon myself and curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featured like him, like him with friends possessed, desiring this man's art and that man's scope, with what I most enjoy contented least. Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, haply I think on thee--" "--and then my state, like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate, for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, that then I scorn to change my state with kings." Fuck. Joshua? Are you OK? Eh. Yeah, I'm OK. I'm fine. - You just startled me. - Sorry. Thunder woke me. When you weren't in bed, I was just kind of worried. What? You're eating. So? So you are human. You had your doubts? I never doubt anything about you. Thanks, I think. Are you sure you're OK? Don't worry about me. You should be in bed. You have to get up in a few hours. I've made my decision. I want to stay here with you. - Well, what about--? -Fuck him. I hope he went off a cliff and died. Never going to let anyone treat me the way he did again. It's just-- When I'm with you, I feel so much stronger, like I can do anything. Don't do this just for me. Are you sure this is what you want? I know we've only been together for a few days. And already you know what a fucked up person I can be. But I have a good heart. I can love. And I know I loved you more these few hours than anyone in my entire pathetic life. And every time I look at you, I-- I know I just want to be a part of you. Oh, come here, baby. You will be. You will be. He's gone. Your brother's dead. Look, I won't stop looking until I find his killer. I won't stop. I promise you. Cam? PJ, I couldn't sleep. I'm going for a drive up in the hills. If you're reading this, don't worry. I'm OK. I'm feeling better now. Thanks for all your help. Cam. PS, I promise I won't skip my meeting tomorrow night. Are you sure you're OK, miss? You don't want to go to the station and press charges? No, I don't think he'll be coming back, not for a long time anyway. I didn't see anybody else out on the road. He must have taken another route. There's lots of little roads out here. It's easy to hide, easier to get lost. You should really look into getting yourself a new boyfriend. Pickings are slim around here. What about you? Excuse me? I see the way you been looking at me. You seem like a nice person. Why don't you ask me out? Don't you think that's a little bit too forward? I mean, we don't even know each other. Ariel. And you are? Officer Ibanez. There, now we've met. Or maybe you just don't find me attractive. I think you're very attractive. Then what's your problem? If you don't mind me saying, I don't think you should be talking to someone you just met like this. It's no wonder why you get yourself in trouble. I can't help it if I'm promiscuous. I've always been that way. One time, my mother caught me in the back of a car with cousin Darien. He was 13. You want to know how old I was? No. 10. You wanna know what we were doing? No. Stop it please. Fine. I was only trying to make conversation. - What would you like to talk about? -Nothing. I just want to get you home safely, and then I'll be on my way. Would you like to hear some tunes? You could try, but we don't get reception out here. So what brings you out here? I'm looking for someone. Ooo. Dead or alive? I'm not sure. He's a missing person. Probably foul play. Well, you've come to the right location. You ever heard of a place called The Harvest? Yeah. It's a broken-down diner near Beads. It's been closed since the '60s. Closed? Are you sure? Yeah. Why? Are you hungry? So what's the name of this guy you're looking for? - Kevin. - Kevin. Now there's a masculine name. Maybe he knows how to treat a girl. He's gay. So tell you what we're going to do. Since you're been so nice giving me a ride home and everything, you're going to stay over at my place tonight. What? It's late. You can get a good night's sleep, wake up, have a good breakfast, and then we'll go and search for-- Um, what's his name again? - Kevin. - Kevin. Thank you, but that's not going to happen. Fine. I just thought I'd be nice. So what's the name of the other guy? The suspect? His name's none. He's a gook. Hey, I don't like that kind of talk. All right. All right. I'm sorry. He's an Asian American? He's none of your business. At least tell me what he looks like. - I might have seen him. -I don't have a description. You don't even know what it looks like? How are you going to find him? I have a sense about these things when it comes to people. I hope so. I hate to think there's a killer running around these hills. If he's out there, I'll find him. You don't have the slightest idea who you're looking for. Don't worry. I'll know him when I see him. Good for you.
