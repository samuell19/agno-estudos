Want to talk about the club? I'm not sorry I decided to open a club for cannabis smokers, even though people think I'm off my rocker. I was definitely crazy before. For nearly a year, my stomach was in knots and I couldn't sleep or eat. I went to three different doctors, none of them knew what was wrong. When kids feel funny, we tell them it's growing pains. When you get older, they tell you it's anxiety. "Control freak." Do I look like a control freak to you? Creating a space where people can relax with just one basic rule: the club is a space for freedom. OK, I did set a few rules to make the place run smoothly, but this isn't Amsterdam. And these rules are all logical. The club serves strong weed that can do this to you. You're here to relax. -Leave me alone. -Listen, look at me. Stop it! It's OK. Just breathe. I know, stop it. Want some water? This is all because of your fucking rules! -This is no time to argue! -Make a rule about it! No arguing when it's all shot to hell! Fuck! Get me water! Why did you lock the door with this mayhem? For security reasons, the front door must remain open! Forget your fucking rules! You just don't get it! Someone robbed us! Robbed what? Huh? SMOKING CLUB (129 RULES) We're out of rolling papers. Danny, how much did we sell last week? 1.8 kilos. -How much do we have now? -One kilo 990 grams. -And three new rules, right? -We needed them. Half a joint more and we're fucked. The police never come in here, this is quieter than your sister's bed. Plus, we're close to the limit, not overboard. -You're the lawyer, man! -Exactly. What happened last time the police came? They left the way they came. Am I right? That's what worries me, you rubbed them the wrong way. Right, so relax! We're winning Le Mans and you want to park the car. What we need to do is step on the gas! In a few years, this will be as legal as parsley. Until then, we just need to play with legal loopholes. -That's all. -Sure, that's all. Sure. -Nessa, do you need help? -Of course not. There's work to be done, that's why we're here. I am working. Not very hard. The guys who pay me are happy. Danny is always 'happy.' And poor Óscar doesn't have the guts to speak up. In the end, I'm the one cleaning up the messes here. But, don't worry about it. Just do the best you can, but please work. Dude, we're not dealers. We're not opening a coffee shop franchise. -The club is great just the way it is. -Yes, it is. But let's not go against the market. We can either grow or die, that's a fact. We have two options: we can stay here competing on quality, raising the price per gram, or we can expand and compete on price. Let me think about it. -Partners? -Partners. Can we open now, or do you still need your privacy? That attitude is no good for this place. Don't look at me like your vibrator ran out of batteries. OK, enough. -You clown... -That's enough, guys. Can you open? I think it's my cousin. No. It's the old lady's nurse. Like every Thursday. No way! It's Thursday already? If it weren't for me, you wouldn't know what day it was. Alright guys, get to work. THIS ISN'T AMSTERDAM Do I have to die to get in? Open the door already! How nice to see you, Doña Dolores. You look better than ever. He said, "Come see me," and I was working at the store. It's been 25 years since we saw each other. Not you. Get the other guy. Is there a problem? I'll help the lady, Danny. Danny, I'll help her. RULE 26: DISCOUNT FOR THERAPEUTIC USES No need to show me that every day. I want something really strong, not that stuff for hippies and teens. This is all we have, we can only offer the quantities and varieties on the menu. Then I'll have the usual and a coffee. And make it snappy. You want something strong? See how you handle this. -I'll get your coffee in two minutes. -OK. Danny? Danny? Hit the black one... Danny? How can you work with someone that dark? As always, it's 50% off. And don't worry, this weed is better than Jesus' miracles. That'll be 30 euros, please. And this makes five. There's a new member coming. -I'll sign her up. -Why didn't you warn me? I didn't realize I had to. Fifty-fifty, remember? Yeah, fifty-fifty. Don't you trust me anymore? -Can she be trusted? -Yes. -She has good references. -Danny! -Can you talk to my cousin? -Yes. -Later. -Later, when? Later as in not now, afterward. She's doing a story about the club. I told you! -The story. -And you can have a smoke with us, -forget all those rules... -OK. Exactly, I can relax, hang out a while... I'm signing in a new member. I'll be right with you. -OK, thanks. -Perfect. You look great. It's good to see you. -How is that shit? -It's strong. Enjoy! I've noticed she's been smoking a lot lately. I don't want any problems. I promise, sir, I'll do my best to stop her from smoking too much. Don't call me sir, we're all friends here. I need to get rid of this shit now! No, I don't care! Pick it up today or I'll throw it out! -What? -I didn't say anything. What's the matter? He doesn't have to tell me everything. I just think he's acting funny. Have you ever seen Danny not act funny? He could have just told you: "We have a new member coming." Well, he just told me. You know this will come back to haunt you. Whether it's Danny or one of the customers, it'll come back to haunt you. Let's not start again. -It's a pipe dream, Óscar. -A very realistic one. What? Starting a club for potheads when you're pushing 40? No, creating a space for freedom after 30, that's different. A space for freedom with 129 rules? Why is it so hard for you to believe in this? -Look... -Forget it... Look, we have a woman in the club who's almost 70. That can't be bad. She's a fascist who's probably scheming -to get rid of all blacks and gypsies. -So what? -So what? -Yeah, so what? Look. See? People here meet and interact. Those two have a lot in common. The same psychiatrist. I think they fit right in, I see it. You know, some people should never be together. Danny is very independent, he's not used to giving explanations. I meant those two guys, but I see you understood. OK. Look at Vanessa. She brings her friends to the club. I bet you've never seen that anywhere. No, I have to admit I haven't. Here, the boss works while the worker smokes dope. This isn't an office job, I'm not her boss. People here can be as committed as they want. It seems she doesn't want to commit. -Do you see anyone complaining? -My coffee! -Where's my coffee? -I'll bring it over in two minutes. Two minutes won't do! I want it now! And I mean right now, not in two minutes! Vanessa! Can you please help the lady? He is such a pain! I'll be right back. Waitress, get my coffee or I'll register a complaint. It's up to you. We don't have a complaints register, lady. What coffee was it? The one I've ordered 150 times since I got here. -The usual, she has it every week. -Right. Which do you prefer? -This one. -This one? -Really? -Yeah. Listen, Fanny. I'm in serious trouble. Is there any coffee left in my office? How would I know, Óscar? -I can't go in there. -I'll let you in. RULE 13: ONLY MANAGERS ARE ALLOWED IN THE OFFICE Voilá. Fucking hell! And this goes here. Go ahead and smoke, Doña Dolores. Let me have it, dear. It's hard to believe people here in Spain are so unnatural. -If Cosme were alive... -I wish he were. If Cosme came back from the dead, what sort of Spain would he find? No, Ken, please. I don't like people touching my beard! It's real! Now, stop it! Those two are faggots! Big ones, Doña Dolores. Stop it! Faggots should be deported! They should go home to Amsterdam or Catalonia! Catalonia isn't a country! Catalonia is not a country! That old lady makes me sick. Fucking fascist! They're all the same. Why is this lady in the club? That's not normal! It's because of Óscar's rules. He makes two new ones a day. Sorry for the wait. Next one's on the house. I would hope so. Remember what I told you. What are you up to? What nerve! If my boyfriend were here... Keep smoking, Doña Dolores, it does wonders for you. There you go. Do you know what this is? I have no idea. But what do you think it is? Something important. Something you'll never in your life regret. What's left of my life. This is an official last will and testament. It's premeditated and irreversible. It wasn't that many rules! They made the place more welcoming. For instance, I can't stand to see people end up alone as time goes by. I really can't stand that. Hence, rule number 67. The first day, you can only smoke if another member treats you. This makes people pay attention to something other than their phones. In fact, there's no coverage here. I thought I was helping that woman, she seemed happy. I thought she was lonely and at least she could relax here. Because... Nobody stops to think about the end of the game . I mean, it's clear that you pay and the house wins, but... Smoking marijuana with your caretaker? What have you done with your life? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR LIFE? Look, there's your friend, -Hi! -the member who recommended you. I want you to know that, from now on, you can count on me as a friend, too. And as a member. Cross-breeding! That's disgusting! -They call it interracial dating. -What did you say? An abomination. Doña Dolores, keep smoking, you'll feel better. -I'm going in, OK? Thanks, Danny. -My pleasure. -Hi! -Hi! Now she's with the faggots! Keep smoking. Dear Lord, how shameful! We were talking about... Yes. Do you know what it means to have a last will and testament that is premeditated and irreversible? I can imagine. My sister Consuelo called me to see how I was doing. All she's interested in is this. But, fortunately, I have you. You look after my house and decipher all that medical jargon... If you didn't pay me a dime, I'd still be happy to do it. You also showed me the one thing that eases my pain. And, best of all, you keep me company. -You're like a daughter to me. -And you're like a mother. That mophead doctor says I'll be joining Cosme soon. So pretty soon it's... underground. Don't say that, Doña Dolores. I could be struck by lightning and suddenly be fried to a crisp and die... Shut your mouth! Don't interrupt me! I have something to tell you. You are the other candidate to become my heir. I'm meeting the notary in 20 minutes to make a final decision. Who's the other candidate? I would leave it all to you, but since you're not interested in money. I've got more than enough with your company. You don't seem very happy. I'm ecstatic. I just have one little question. Who is the other finalist? Even though I haven't spoken to my sister in 15 years, she's still my sister. The sister you just called a harlot a few seconds ago? -That one. -Just to make sure. Life is full of surprises, you know. And maybe this... isn't... going into the right hands. Are you doubting my integrity? Of course I am! I'm an open book for you, ask me whatever you want. Your boyfriend. Why haven't I met him? Huh? Is he a whoremonger? No, dear Lord! He's very busy working at the bank. -Who does he vote for? -Well... He's... apolitical. 'Apolitical' sounds like 'communist.' Never! Jorge is apolitical, but basically right-wing. I want to meet him, now. He can't come in here, it's against Óscar's rules. Then outside! Now! -I'm afraid it's a bit late. -Banks don't open in the afternoon. He has to go evict a foreign family this afternoon. If you don't introduce us, all this is going to Consuelo. Oh, dear Lord! I'm so embarrassed to have to confess this. -I knew you were hiding something. -It's really... -Tell me. -I don't know if I can. Tell me now! You know I don't like secrets. I've been forced to completely cut off all contact with Jorge. -Don't tell me he's French? -Even worse. He's... Basque. Well, at least he's Spanish. -French Basque. -French Basque? I became suspicious because he has dinner at 6 p.m. -That's gross. -He had me fooled all along, saying he was from Ciudad Real. Didn't the accent give him away? He had a bit of a lisp, but I thought that was just because his tongue is so big. Like all Frenchmen. Are you OK? I'm heartbroken. I was afraid you'd be disappointed if I told you. My family never approved of my marriage with Cosme. He was a real man. He knew his place, he had balls. It's exactly the same with me! We have so much in common! Except I wasn't mistaken about Cosme. Cosme was a good man. Anyone with 600 hectares of vineyards is sure to be a good man. Do you still have the vineyards? Yes. But, without Cosme, it's nothing but money. I love vineyards, like in Hello Magazine. Hello is full of whores. I meant the vineyards, not the whores. Your reaction is a credit to you. It's made me rethink things. you deserve to be rewarded for your loyalty to me and to spain. And soon. It makes me panic to think that mophead doctor might be right. Don't say that, you'll be around for years! -Put my name in there if it helps. -Shut up! You give me a headache when you talk so much! Long live Spain! You were talking about my service to Spain, if I recall correctly. No, I don't think so. Something to do with... -With what? -With your savings. Yes. As I was saying, your loyalty to Spain deserves this. Meeting you is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Shut up and go get my free coffee. Let's just get the paperwork over with so we can save this country together. Yes. Made in China. I wonder if this is a sign? How could you make Silvia a member? How was I to know it was his Silvia? You're partners, don't you talk? We don't need to, we're connected through WiFi. Right, does it cover those packages? What packages? Can't you take anything seriously? This is a business. In the real world, businesses fail. Yeah, but this isn't the real world. What if Cosme is trying to send me a message from the grave? Cosme is thrilled with all this. Don't worry, I'll hurry to the bar and ask for a pen with that coffee. Cosme? Excuse me, the lady has a free coffee waiting for her. Nothing here is free. You have to pay. Óscar told her the next coffee was on the house. And a pen, if you have one, please. Sure. Hey, I've seen what you're up to. I mean, the lady is smoking too much, she's turning green. This is her nap time, but she's perfectly well. Please have a seat. I'll serve you the coffee. This is dead. I'll pack another one and we're all set. But first, let's finish the paperwork. You know, I've been talking with Cosme! What? With his whiskers and suspenders... Just as he looked 15 years ago. Are you sure you're OK? You seem a bit confused. He said... -"If you sign that..." -I think you need another coffee. Where's that coffee? "If you sign that..." The coffee! "If you sign that..." Doña Dolores? "I'll kill you." Doña Dolores? Doña Dolores? Oh, no! She's dying! Somebody please call an ambulance! Doña Dolores? I'm not a drug dealer, and this isn't an opium den. Weed isn't usually that strong, but, frankly, the caretaker is the one to blame, right? What was I supposed to do? Butt in there and ban someone from smoking? No. Not here. Not at the club. I DON'T KNOW YOU Do you know what this is? A joint. A joint? Is the Sistine Chapel a ceiling? This, my friend, is a masterpiece. This is a prodigy of genetics. It's Red Poison. A very strong Indica. Its parent plants are a female Green Poison cross-pollinated with a Hindu Kush variety, grown in Pakistan. It adds a touch of color. and shortens the flowering period, adding sweet and savory nuances to its aroma. It's... Like smoking an orca, you know? It's purple weed. The color.... is not decisive in any way, but it adds a fresh and fun touch. Appetizing. Do you want to smoke it? -What energy does it have? -What energy? Yours, mine, ours, that cool energy of attraction that makes girls look at you and think: "That guy's hot!" They see me and think: "He must be hung like a horse." But what really matters is that you not do anything between that first encounter with the girl and the subsequent ejaculation to fuck up that first impression. That's true, see. And you want to smoke this joint. So? Any doubts? I'm not going to force you to smoke it. Which reminds me... Danny. Danny? For €15, this beauty is yours. -I don't know, it's expensive. -Expensive? Pay me after you smoke it. I don't want any unsatisfied customers. Yeray? Agustín. -Agustín, from Tenerife. -No. When we were kids, my family vacationed there. -You're... -In much better shape! This is great, Yeray! You look so different. I never liked seeing these two together. They're really off their rockers. But who am I to tell people what they should do? I have a meeting now, -do you mind...? -Not at all. -Let's sit and catch up. -Some other time. -I have a very important meeting and-- -Just five minutes! I'll leave when the meeting starts. Guys, don't make a scene. Nothing personal, that's what Rule 74 says. It's been 25 years since we saw each other. Have I ever pretended to be someone I'm not? And who the hell am I? That makes it hard to comply with Rule 87: Be yourself. At times, we no longer know who we are or what we want. We're propelled by inertia to fit in. But fit into what? Do whatever you want. That's all. -Agustín... -Ken. -What? -Call me Ken. -As in Barbie? -No, as in Street Fighter. Oh, right, the video game. You look great, kid. I'm really happy to see you. How is it? It's pretty strong. Enjoy. I loved it when you stole the cinnamon rolls -just to get the Star Wars stickers! -Yeah, but you ate them all, and it was 15 rolls! I also took all the blame. -Listen... -I don't know who told them. My parents made me go to fat camp for a year. -I bet you made friends. -Worst fucking year of my life! The monitors used us as punching bags. Yeah, camp monitors are bastards. If it weren't for you, I would've been there another year. -Why? -You're the only one who defended me. Yeah. This weed is fucking strong. Want some? No, it smells funny. -Danny grew it, it's great shit. -Shit? -It's weed. -But it's adulterated, that's dangerous! What do you do aside from smoking joints? Don't get me wrong. I'm not a junkie smoking any old shit. The business I'm in... is very serious. That's why this meeting I'm about to have is so important. Just remember... I won't accept any old job. I totally understand. You can't just take any shit job. I'm a taekwondo teacher at a high school in Fuenlabrada. I mentor kids for two or three years and teach them that winning isn't what matters, it's competing without losing or tying. Are you a spiritual leader? I'm their sensei. One day, I'll have my own dojo. Let me know if you offer Pilates, my back is shot! You know, I almost made the Olympics. I came this close. -I lost the last match. -These things happen. I took a mawashi geri right in my face and lost. Concentration is important. That's what I tell my kids! Feel part of your surroundings. -Become one with your rival. -You know what? I think it's a good thing you didn't go to the Olympics. What's wrong with the Olympics? The question is... what's not wrong with the Olympics? I know things that would make society... topple to the ground. What things? I have evidence of very serious matters. Hence the meeting. But I can't talk about it. Listen... seriously... I need to relax a bit before the person I'm meeting gets here. And alone. You're meeting a girl. Your girlfriend? Yes. I mean, almost. We're just getting to know each other. -Do you have a girlfriend? -No. I haven't met the yin for my yang. But I know a thing or two about the female body. I'm a bit nervous, I don't know if she'll like the club. Yeray, I'll help you feel at ease. -No, that's not necessary. -I owe you one. -No, really. -We're closing the circle, that's that. If you used better penmanship keeping the accounts, we'd save time. I'm serious, Óscar, this is impossible to read. -I need you to sign these. -OK. -And I need your index finger, -OK. -to take your fingerprint. -Of course. We have cutting-edge technology, you'll see, you'll like it. OK. That's Silvia. That's why he was waiting outside. -I'm sure there's an explanation. -I can't wait to hear it... -Drop it, sis. -Where are you going, Óscar? -Leave me alone! -Óscar! Don't hide! What are you, 10? Óscar! People were constantly giving me advice about how to lead my life. Everyone knows a bunch of stuff about you. And yet they know nothing about themselves. And they don't seem very happy. Thanks, I'll call you if I need anything. Anything at all, OK? Call me or my partner, he's around here somewhere... I'll introduce you later. You'd make a good match. You're tall, he is too. You're beautiful, he's... You'll see. -I'm going in, OK? Thanks, Danny. -OK. Hi! -Hi. -Hi. This is Agustín, he was just leaving. Look, she's with the faggots now! Keep smoking. Dear Lord, how shameful! -Want to play pool? -I'll pass. -I don't know how, but I can learn. -I'll teach you. Thanks. Did they tell you about the club? There's a bunch of rules. The boss told me the basic rules. They even fingerprinted me! That's so they don't need to issue documents that can be forged or incriminate them. Their ass is well-covered. They could cut your finger off. Where did you find this new member? -She's hot, right? -Yeah. She was recommended by Yeray, the weirdo. The loser with the cap? Why didn't you tell me? Do I have to inform you every time I pee? -Relax, that's not it. -I'm relaxed. That's Silvia. I know. No! She's your Silvia? My Silvia. Of all the smoking clubs in the world, she had to walk into mine. I moved out almost a year ago, and I haven't talked to her since. On my scale of misery from one to 100, the feeling of loving someone yet being unhappy is the worst. It would've been easier to catch her with another guy, at least no one would have blamed me. The problem with this sort of club is the smell. Without good ventilation, the whole street smells like pot. So we spent a fortune on extractors and imposed Rule 3. Close one door before opening another. This rule is sacred. How would I know she was my student's mother? My turn. That joint smells good. One of the club members grows it. It's great shit. -Do you smoke? -He's too scared. I'm not scared, give me that. It's good. Try to get it in there. Hey, that's hard! I'll teach you. Oh, yeah! -Yeah. -Oh, yeah! Good move. That Fourth Millennium exhibit was great! The replicas were awesome. Is that how you met? No, we met in a gardening forum. You had a problem with some azaleas. Yeray helped me and we started chatting. Cool! Notice how the energy's flowing here? It's not working. It's not working... What were you talking about? -Girls. -Stephen Hawking. What? Stephen Hawking had no luck with girls. But he claimed science had backed God into a corner. He said we don't need God to explain the universe. -And what does God think? -That's the question. Do you think Stephen Hawking was one to talk in his state? There's no mind-reading software. It's the chair. The chair has grown conscious of itself and deposed God as creator of the universe. Stephen Hawking's chair killed God. For all we know, all Stephen Hawking thought about was tits and asses while his chair was planning to take over the world. This is just one of many examples, that's why we need to be careful. -We can't be too careful. -Why? I love your theories, Yeray. I do my best to promote them. If you pocket the black ball, you win. There you go, kid. Yeray, be careful. Fuck! Fucking hell! Sorry. Get out of here! -Should we sit down? -Sure. -Oh, it fell. -I can see that. Great shot! -Have a seat. -No, I'm fine, you take it. Go on, sit down. So how did you two meet? You seem very different. -So do you two. -We've only just met. Agustín and his parents, that was his name then, vacationed near my parents' house. -And we played together sometimes. -Almost every day. Cool, you're childhood friends! -I still have childhood friends. -Yeah? Why don't you introduce us, right, Yeray? Yeray was a great kid. One of the few friends I had back then. Agustín was very different as a kid. How much did you weigh at age 12, 95 kilos? -He was obese. -Poor guy. He wasn't that fat. I teach little kids. If they're mean to each other, I make them do equations. They get along great, as you can imagine! I'm a teacher, too. At a high school. Ken is a sensei. Mine do fingerpainting and that sort of thing. It's all very messy. Kids used to make fun of me, until, one day, I said, "Enough!" I started doing taekwondo and I almost made the Olympics. But you didn't. Yeah, what I mean is that life and the world flow in an endless cycle. Things can change overnight. Like today, for instance. I hadn't seen Yeray in over 25 years. This was no coincidence. Joints really make the conversation flow. What? This may sound strange, but, hit me. I mean, slap me so I can teach you how energy flows. OK. See? I can store it, or let if flow. She barely touched you. OK, you try it. -No, I'll pass. -Come on, hit me! -Hit me. -Come on! Hit me. Go ahead. Hit me! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were bald! -Are you OK, Yeray? -Yes... It wasn't as bad as it looked. -It looked bad. -It was a demonstration, sorry. What's wrong with you? Go to the bar and leave me alone! Why are you saying that? Don't worry, I'll go. That's some help! What's with the moustache? Buy me a beer and tell me about your life. Sure. -Don't you like the moustache? -It looks weird. I see you met my partner, Danny. Quite a character. How long have you known him? Remember that guy at college who had a chauffer? That's him. That makes sense. His parents are diplomats, he's traveled a lot. -He's more interesting than it seems. -I don't doubt that. Right. -Should we sit down? -OK. -Hi, Elena. -How are you? How could you make Silvia a member? How was I to know it was his Silvia? You're partners, don't you talk? So, how are you? Good, I'm still working at the school. And I've been trying new things, like coming here! If I had known it was you, I would have met you at the door. -Who recommended you? -Yeray. The guy with the baseball cap. He doesn't look familiar. We have a lot of customers. Today is quieter than usual. I can see that. So are you a dealer now? I'm not precisely Pablo Escobar. The club is really an association that dispenses marijuana semi-legally. We used to smoke once in a while, but I never thought you'd go pro. It's not about the weed, I just like hanging out here. -It sounds weird to hear you say that. -Why? I'm really glad you're happy, it's just hard to understand. -That's all. -Well... The club is more a consequence than a cause. A year ago, it never would have occurred to me to do this. Just try not to end up in jail. At least you won't have a boyfriend in jail. Sorry, that was uncalled for. I can't laugh about it just yet. I think we broke up in time. It was hard, but at least we salvaged memories of... We salvaged them? Maybe you did. I was still happy with you. -This isn't easy. -Nothing is easy. But I'm not just a memory. I'm sitting here. -What I mean is... -I know exactly what you mean. But don't tell me I should be grateful because, believe me, I'm not. Silvia is really great. She really is. So why did I make that decision? It wasn't fair to her. But it wasn't fair to me to stay with her when I no longer felt the same. What can I say? Life isn't fair. Sorry. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid. You need another coffee. Right. I'm sorry, too. Where's that coffee? You know what? I liked you better fat! Don't call me fat! I guess some things never change. You can work your ass off and still be a loser all your life. Agus the Fatso. Don't call me fat, I'll lose it! I think the trick is to enjoy the present, the moment you're having now. If you're always wanting more, it just fucks everything up. Doña Dolores? Doña Dolores? You know, I'm the one who told your parents about the rolls! She's dying! Somebody please call an ambulance! Doña Dolores? And that's where Rule 12 comes in, which, to me, is the fairest of all. Enjoy your moment. Damn it! BREAKING THE RULES He died while watching TV. Can you get any sadder? But you couldn't have known your father was dying! He called me the day before. He literally said, "Come see me, I'm dying." I had to work at that fucking shop. Vanessa! Can you please help the lady? -Vanessa! -He's such a pain! I'll be right back. Look, Lu. Look. Waitress, get my coffee or I'll register a complaint. It's up to you. -This one. -We don't have a complaints register. What coffee was it? Listen, Fanny. I'm in serious trouble. My father was a drinker and he liked gambling. And he left me a 50,000-euro debt. If I sell the house and all his stuff, at most I'll get 20,000 euros. Look, Lu. When someone is in trouble, like you are, the rest of us have to lean in. -That would be so... -Let me finish. I need someone to help me with my blog. -To help with your blog? -To work with me. Now that you mention it, I'd love to be partners. Partners? Fucking hell! No, I don't need a partner, I need an intern. An intern. You've been an intern four years, who better? Forget it. But... I thought you needed money? I need 30,000 euros, not a job as an intern. You're smoking too much. That old lady makes me sick. Fucking fascist. They're all the same. Why is this lady in the club? That's not normal! It's because of Óscar's rules. He makes two new ones a day. Well, I think it's a good thing. Let her do whatever she wants. Right, she's not screaming stupid comments in your face. -Why can't you scream back? -Because I need to eat. I mean... I need to eat and... I think they want to fire me. -What? -You heard me. -Yeah. -It's bad timing! -I know. -We'll get evicted! What am I supposed to do? Óscar's sister hates me. She's such a bitch! -But Óscar likes you. -Not really. He doesn't have the balls to confront the bitch! You two are in quite a bind. You can't get fired! Without your salary, we're fucked. I saw something. What is it? Stop jerking around and tell me. When I went in the office, I saw a duffle bag stuffed full of marijuana. Isn't that normal? There's only so much weed the club can buy. It's maybe about two kilos But that bag alone contains three fucking kilos of marijuana. -Where did it come from? -It must be the dandy's. -Who's the dandy? -Danny. -The guy I'm interviewing? -Don't ask about that. Of course not! And you keep your mouth shut, you're prettier quiet. OK, what should we do with the bag? -What should we do? -Should we take it? Take it? What do you mean? Oh, please, Lucía! Don't be naive, taking it means taking it. -It means stealing it. -Stealing it? How could I steal it? They won't let me in the office! But, I mean, you wouldn't believe how much weed is in that bag. -How much? -Enough. You can't steal from a dealer, especially not if he's black. He's not a dealer. I was a missionary in Africa. -You were there five days. -So what? Huh? Look, girls... blacks... Blacks carry guns. Fuck! Fucking hell! -Sorry. -Get out of here! Let's see, they might carry guns in Africa. Well! -Hi, Danny. -What do we have here? This is my cousin, Lucía. Hi, nice to meet you. Lucía, the journalist. Nessa told me about your father. I'm sorry for your loss. -That's life. Thanks. -You're welcome. -Where did you come from? -From the office. Yeah, but I meant, what country. Nigeria. Shall we start? Sure, and let's be quick, I have another matter to attend to. OK. No. No recordings. I'm sure you'll understand. Sure, don't worry about it. -I actually prefer taking notes. -Good. OK. So, tell me. What do you do for a living? I make love, Lucía. I'm kidding. -I'm a lawyer. -Oh. And a founding member of a cannabis smoking club. Could you explain what services the club offers? We provide our members with a product that is on demand in the market. We cater to a select public. RULE #29: WE ARE NOT DEALERS You won't find these people buying weed on the streets at 3 a.m. I can't answer that, all I can say is that the dope we have is the shit. We're not acting outside the law, We're Just Taking Advantage Of Existing Inconsistencies. -Is selling drugs dangerous? -Not as dangerous as giving it away. -Do you have a gun? -Fanny, this is an interview. Can't I ask questions? Have you had any problems with your customers? That's a good question. This one time... this soccer club came in to celebrate after a match. We had a problem with the lock and they came in looking for trouble. They wanted marijuana and I had to say, "No!" And then... they left. Have you ever been in jail? Fanny, why don't you go out and get some fresh air? What's wrong? Don't you want me here? What the fuck are you doing? -Do you mind if we take a break? -Sure, we'll start again... -Later, OK? -Whenever you want. -Thanks. -Shit. Danny, I need to ask you something. Do you have a moment? -Sure, what is it. -Is everything OK? Aside from wanting to kill "Miss Ku Klux Klan Sympathizer," yes. She's a good person, deep down, just a little clueless. You know she sells dolls over the Internet to 'cure' people? -She's crazy. -What did you want to ask? Just to be clear, we can't pay you more. No, that's not it. See... I've noticed there's some tension between you and Óscar lately, I just wanted to offer my support. He's getting carried away with all these rules. And who's looking after us? I'm not following you. You need to keep Óscar in check, he can't run the business. We're both running the business. Right, OK. I just wanted to offer my support. I don't need your support, I just want you to work. Óscar and I get along fine, that's none of your business. Get to work. Do you realize this could get my cousin fired? I just wanted to know if it was dangerous! So you asked if he had a gun? If he has a gun, he could shoot us. Are you sure you're OK? You seem a bit confused. Why would he shoot us? I was just interviewing him! Lu, I'm trying to help you! -You're not letting things flow. -You cocksucker! I offered you a job. I listened to you whining about your father. You've been using my notebook! And my pen. Where's that coffee? Man, you are a horrible person. Don't call me fat! It's... unjust. What's really unjust is that a useless airhead is more successful as a journalist. Agus the Fatso. I'm destitute. Working in a clothing store instead of reporting the news. But on top of that, since I'm so fucking awesome, I'm also saddled with debt, Fanny! I can't pay that off working as an intern for a retard who scribbles stuff on paper and then eats it! Doña Dolores? Doña Dolores? Doña Dolores? Oh my God, she's dying! Somebody please call an ambulance! Doña Dolores? Clear the way! Wait! Óscar, her head. Careful with the head. Here. Put her down. Get me the first aid kit and the manual. -Where's the manual? -It's in the office. -No, it's not. -What? I threw it out. -I can't believe this! -It was too bulky. -I needed room for... -For what? It's a medical manual, not an encyclopedia! If it were an encyclopedia, I would've kept it! -What was it doing in my office? -Enough! There's a lady dying here, someone please do something, hurry up and call an ambulance. She's dying. The fucking cunt is dying. Where's that freaking leaflet? OK. Looks grim. Very grim. Sorry I lost it earlier, I'm usually totally Zen. I'm sorry I told on you and all that, but... Don't worry. Yes, number 22. Yes, 2 - 2. No, I barely know her. -You need to forget it. -Forget what? -You know. -No, I don't. -Silvia and you. -What about us? If I were you, I'd compete in a lower category or in heavier weights. I said the prescription doesn't say anything, just a number... Sorry. Son of a bitch! Sorry. Stop it, already! Damn it! Son of a bitch! Ken, calm down. Back off. Don't hurt him. Calm down, please. Back off. Please, back off. Kid, anger will lead you to the dark side. Yeah, that's right. It's urgent, please. Yes, number 22. Son of a bitch! Back off! You just don't get it! Nessa, go get the first aid kit. Go get it, damn it! Breathe. It's alright. Look at me. Calm down, OK? Breathe. I'll get the first aid kit! ...favoring life, not death. Let's favor life. Think positive. The first aid kit. The first aid kit. Are you crazy? What now? -What will we do with it? -Take it to sell, let's go. What about your job and my interview? Forget that, it's now or never. -What the fuck is this? -An open first aid kit. -The next step is to use it. -No, Danny... All we have is alcohol and a fan. -Leave it here and forget about it. -If you don't want it, I'll take it. But don't you dare ask for a single cent. I saw you mixing up the weed. And I saw you giving it to her. -We'll end up in jail! -They can't report us for stealing pot! Óscar doesn't even know this exists. -I served her strong weed. -Danny... The club serves some strong weed. She couldn't handle it. What if Fanny's right? -They'll shoot us! -No, they won't. Think of a Plan B in case she dies and go get water. -I'll get water. -Great. -Please, fan her. -Yes. Look. OK! Want some water? This is all because of your fucking rules! -This is no time to argue! -Make a rule about it! No arguing when it's all shot to hell! Red or black? Yes or no? Yes or no? -Yes! -Let's go. Get me water! -Please play it cool. -I know, I'm not an idiot! Why did you lock the door with this mayhem? For security reasons, the front door must remain open! Forget your fucking rules! You just don't get it! Someone robbed us! Robbed what? Huh? What? They're going to kill us! Six months working on 129 rules in all to make the place and its patrons a little better than the norm. And in just one second, I realized it wasn't working. When every variable except one has changed, you begin to realize where the problem lies. Damn it! Give me the fucking bag! Danny, Nessa, in the office, now! In the office, now! I knew this would happen. I saw it coming. Elena, stay with the lady, and she better not die in the club. The doors will open automatically in ten minutes. What the fuck is this? -Weed. -I know what it is! I want you to tell me where the fuck you got it? -I-- -I want Danny to tell me! -I'm not the one who was stealing! -Partners, remember? It wasn't supposed to be here long. I took a chance! Why didn't you tell me? This is a about trust. If you want trust, stop making stupid rules! I want this to work! Stop acting behind my back, is that too much to ask? Is it too much to ask that we stop letting that racist woman in? -What's this about? -It's about everything! This is a space for freedom! But just your freedom, everyone else is left out. And the bitch even gets free coffee! It's my club! I can treat anyone I want! Our club. It's both or ours. Fifty-fifty, remember? Don't you see, if we don't let her in, we're as bad as she is. It's not the same thing! People are just as bad in here as they are out there! You and my sister are a lot alike, you know. You talk just like her. Vanessa, please leave. I'll call you when we decide what to do. -But... -Please leave, I'll call you. This isn't our game, man. Please, don't leave! Stop it! Please, don't scream! Old cunt! I've put up with you nine months and you had to die now! It's my fault for not making you sign with your own blood. Leave the lady alone! And one more thing! If Cosme came back from the grave, I'd hit his head with the fucking tombstone! Aren't any of you lazy ass potheads, fucking sons of bitches, going to help me? You! You could care less, huh? Is your brain so rotted that you can't even react? Doña Dolores, you're alive! How could you let that wetback touch me? That's disgusting! Madam, we thought you were dying! Shut up, you pig! I wish someone had helped me, so I'd know what to expect. That someone had shown me the ropes. I would have done things differently. At least I would have known what I was doing all these years. I would have been spared some lies, and I would have spared others from hearing my advice. As if I knew shit about what people need. But I can't spend my life being someone I'm not just because it's easier. Because it's what I'm supposed to do. Silvia did nothing wrong, she was perfectly alright. It wasn't meant to be because life isn't fair. If it were, I would have been in love with her all my life. Well, are you going to tell me... who put that fan in the first aid kit, please? Danny. Yes, it helps the glue on the plasters dry more quickly. Oh. It actually came in handy. We'll be back tomorrow, at least I will. Who knows? -Óscar, I'm sorry... -Not now, I'll see you tomorrow. Here? Yes, I'll see you here. But that duffle bag has to go. OK. -Anyway, there's a package missing. -There's a package missing? I don't know who you're dealing with, but take care if it. -And don't do it again. -Right. Partners? See you tomorrow. By the way, Silvia's still at the bar. I fell asleep. Sorry. Bye. That was fucking crazy! Are you still drawing? -Just doodling. -You're really good. You could be a professional. It's a little late. A little late? Did you know Danny stashed marijuana at the club? No, I had no idea. No idea. Are you going to go on with it? What do you think? It's totally unlike you. I know. First I need to clean this up. Listen, Silvia... If you want... I don't know. Purple weed. That's fucked up, Danny. I thought that, with three doors and 129 rules, I could leave my past behind, but that's not the way things work. Now I understand something my sister always says: that I don't see the club for what it is, I see it as I am. But maybe one day I'll get things to work the way they should. After all, this doesn't end here. Want to talk about the club? RULE #1: THE CLUB IS A SPACE FOR FREEDOM THE CLUB IS A SPACE FOR FREEDOM Subtitles by: Eva Obregón
