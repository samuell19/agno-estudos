- America's hottest screen couple Sam Austin and Naomi Tills burned up the box office last year with their smash hit Moon Brake, but could the fire be going out on their marriage? The pair has not been seen together since the premiere of that movie last July and there are rumors swirling that they've actually been separated for several months now. So after nearly 10 years of marriage and one child together, we all just wanna know will it be divorce for? - Vultures. (phone ringing) - [Sam] This is Sam. I am not here. Leave a message and I'll call you back. - Hey, it's me again. Look, I don't want to fight. I'm gonna come by and pick up Jack. Please have him ready. Also the lawyer's gonna call you in the morning. Okay bye. (suspenseful music) Dammit. Are you serious? (suspenseful music) You know what? You know what? It's fine. I'm already running late. I have to pick up my son and I can't do this right now. And I just. (suspenseful music) (moves into bright music) - [Interviewer] Are you gonna be the leading man in the new superhero franchise, Vindicators of Earth? - Where did you hear that? - My sources tell me. Is that true? - Yes, it is true. - God, that man is so beautiful. You are so lucky. - Lucky? I rarely even see him, let alone talk to him. - The whole time I've been in L.A., the closest I've gotten to a celebrity is standing behind that guy from "Friends" at Pinkberry. Meanwhile you get to teach a movie star's son every day for the past year. - Yeah and in another two months I'm gonna need a new job unless they make me permanent. - Whatever. It's Sam Austin. That man could read me a bedtime story any night of the week, girl. - You are ridiculous. - And I have to ask you. How are you and Jack adjusting? How are you doing? - It's been tough. Not only did I lose the love of my life, but I lost my best friend and Jack lost his mom. I'm just trying to stay focused on what's best for Jack. It's not easy for us but I'm staying positive that the police are gonna find Naomi's killer and that Jack and I will be able to move on with our lives. - I just feel bad for Jack. Can you imagine losing your mother like that? - I imagine I can handle a loss like that if Sam Austin were my daddy. - Awful. - [TJ] I'm just kidding. - You are just awful. - Come on, Case. You can't tell me you've never thought about it. Sam comes to the school to pick up Jack and you have to have a private conversation. So you're all alone in the classroom and he's looking at you with those beautiful eyes and you're looking at that chiseled body and then all of a sudden bam. You're on the desk. Crayons are flying. Markers are flying. And then he goes into your shirt. - Okay. Oh my God. - Girl, you have zero imagination. Like zero. That's why you're single. - All right well you know what? I think it's time for you to go because I have to prep for tomorrow. - Prep? They're eight years old, Casey. - Yeah, temporary position. I have to make a good impression. - The only temporary position you should be worried about is the one you're gonna make on Sam Austin. - [Casey] Okay goodbye, TJ. - You're so boring, Casey. Goodness. Bye girl. - Bye. Love you. - [Interviewer] How was it doing your own stunts in this movie? - It was painful. - [Interviewer] Was it? - Yeah. (bell ringing) (children screaming) (soft music) - Back to one. And action. Mister Crawley, the explorer. ♪ Dun dun dun dun dun ♪ ♪ Dun dun dun dun dun ♪ ♪ Dun dun dun dun ♪ He's alone in the world but he's brave and he's... - [Casey] What you doing, Jack? - Making a movie. - Oh. What's it about? - This bug. - What happens? - I can't tell you. - [Casey] Why not? - Spoiler alert, duh. - Okay well, carry on, Spielberg. ♪ Dun dun dun dun dun ♪ ♪ Dun dun dun dun ♪ Wait. Where you going, Mister Crawley? Wait up. Wait. Mister Crawley turned into an alien and now he's hunting for spiders. Ah. - Hey Jack. - [Casey] Crosswalk please. - [Girl] Okay. (soft music) - Yeah come on. We don't wanna keep your dad waiting, do we? We're supposed to meet him for ice cream. - [Jack] Dad wants us to go get ice cream? - Yes, he does and he doesn't want us to be late. So come on. Let's get in. Here we go. Come on. Get in. - [Casey] Jack. - [Jack] Casey. - Did you forget something? Hi, I'm Casey Wright, one of Jack's teachers. Are you picking him up today? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sam got caught up so he asked me to pick up the little guy here. We're going for ice cream. - Ice cream. Oh man, I wish someone was taking me for ice cream. - [Jack] Can Casey come, too? She's really nice. - I don't. I don't think your dad would like that, but we have to go. So come on. - Actually it says here his Aunt Meredith is picking him up. - Yeah well you know how these things are. Sometimes they forget to update them. It's fine. All right Jack, it's time to go. It's time to go. Come on. - I understand and I hate to slow you down, but rules and everything, you know. - Uh huh. Yeah no that's fine. I will show you the letter that I have and. - Hey. Jack. Jack. (dramatic music) Oh my god. Jack, are you okay? - Yeah. - Oh my god. Is Jack okay? - He's fine thanks to you. This is Mark Haynes, Sam Austin's associate. - Hey. - And this is Detective Bruner. - Hi. - [Detective] Hi. - Nice to meet you. - They'd like to talk to you for a bit. I'll be just outside if you need anything. - Thank you. - Thank you. I don't even know where to start. There's really no way we can thank you enough for everything that you did today. - I'm just glad Jack's okay. - He's fine. He's on his way home with his Aunt Meredith. - Good. As the Head Mistress said, this is Detective Bruner. He's been working the stalking issues that Sam's been having for awhile. He's gonna ask you a few questions. You know just general stuff. Okay? - Okay. I thought I already... - Casey, you gave the police a pretty detailed description of the woman, but I need different type of questions answered. We believe that the woman that tried to kidnap Jack could in fact be the same woman that's causing these stalking problems. You've been at the school for almost a full year now. Is that right? - [Mark] You two keep going. I'll be right back. - [Detective] Okay Casey, just a few quick questions. Has Jack ever mentioned this woman before? We don't think this is the first time she tried to make contact. Casey? Casey? - Oh, I'm sorry. What was the question? You don't think I love you, Jennifer? Of course I love you. Loving you is the only thing that I'm sure and I dream about you every day. Your eyes. Your smile. You're everything to me. I love you. - I love you, too. I love you so much. (bell ringing) - Miss Wright? Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Jack's dad, Sam. - I know who you are. Hi. Sorry, I'm Casey. Late lunch. - I'm sorry to interrupt. I just wanted. God, I don't even know what to say. - Oh, it was nothing. - It was not nothing. Jack is safe because of you and I can't thank you enough. - I'm just glad I could help. Jack is a really great kid. - Yeah, yeah he is. He means the world to me and I would do anything to keep him safe, which is why I wanted to come thank you personally. You know, Jack really likes you, too. He has been raving about his favorite teacher Casey all year. I've gotta say you're not what I had in mind. - What did you have in mind? - Well, my third grade teacher was about 80 years older and she had a mustache. Let's just say you're a lot different than Missus Parker. - Oh. Well, thank you. (knocking on door) - Sam. Sorry to interrupt. Can I talk to you real quick? - Excuse me a second. - Sure. (gentle music) - [Mark] Well, I'll leave you two alone. - Where were we? (gentle music) (phone buzzing) (phone dinging) - Casey. Sam had to go deal with some things, but he wanted me to thank you again for everything that you did. - Oh. Okay. All right. - [Jacquelyn] I was three years into a dead end job with 80,000 in student loans. I needed to reboot and rethink what I was doing. I took a calculated risk and it paid off. - [Man] And that's exactly why I wanted you to come to the podcast today, so we can sit here and discuss debt, student loans, bad credit. You name it. I'm here with Jacquelyn from Unique Space who's here. (soft music) - Hey Casey. I'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for her bath. - Yeah okay. I was just leaving. Bye Mom. (soft music) - I need these reports to be more specific. Time stamped with detailed notes for billing. Miss Wright. - Mister Clark. - [Mister Clark] Visiting your mother again I see. - I sure am. - Well I'm sure she appreciates your visits. While you're here could I have a word with you for a moment? - I was just leaving. - It'll just take a second. It's over $14,000 and it's 60 days overdue. - I have been dealing with her insurance companies and they assured me it would be paid on time. - But it's already not been paid on time. That's gonna have consequences for your mother's care if you don't pay that bill. - Obviously my mother's care is my number one priority as I'm sure it is yours. - Yes, of course. In fact, this institution's number one concern about everything else is the excellent care that our patients receive. - Wonderful. - And that's why I'm so concerned about the impact on your mother's health if she has to be forced to leave this facility due to lack of payment. Could be devastating in her fragile condition. But you know what? Why are we even talking about this? I am sure that you're gonna be able to pay that bill in full within 30 days. (soft music) (soft music) - Sam, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much for meeting with me today. I just. I really want to explain what happened today at Jack's school. I overreacted. I know. I know I'm just out of options. I needed to talk to you. And you won't return my calls or texts. I needed to see you 'cause I missed you so much and I just I knew if I could just pick up Jack that you would just give me the chance to make things right. I know, I know. I know I was wrong. You're right. Believe I would give anything to take it back. I would. I would. I'm so sorry. What? Really? Are you sure? No. No, you do not need to apologize. Not for anything. I should've listened to you from the beginning. You're always right. Of course I love you. Yes I do. (knocking on door) - [Mother] Lynette. Honey, is everything okay? - Yeah mom. I'm okay. (soft music) - Casey Wright? - Can I help you? - Got her. Hey Casey, we just wanna ask you a few questions. - [Reporter] Casey over here. Casey, where you going? - [Interviewer] Casey please one second of your time. - [Reporter] Tell me about the kidnapper. Did you see anything? - [Interviewer] Casey, did you get a good look at the kidnapper? - [Reporter] Are you and Sam an item? - [Interviewer] Come on, Casey. - [Reporter] Are you cashing in? - [Interviewer] Wy did she target Jack? - [Reporter] Is he helping your mother? - I don't know. - [Interviewer] Do you think she killed Naomi? - [Reporter] No, no, I think you do know. What can you tell me about th... - Casey, did Sam Austin give you any money for helping... - Hey guys knock that crap off. - [Reporter] Just ignore him. Just ignore him. - Hey, I said knock it off. I said back off now. Hey man, we have a right to be here. - Watch your head. Watch your head. (soft music) You okay? Casey, are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you. - Just doing my job. I didn't think they'd be on you this quickly. Hollywood's a small town. - But I'm not in Hollywood. - You are now. Like it or not after what you did for Sam and Jack, you're the new flavor of the month. - How did they find me? - Money talks. Just be glad it's only the paparazzi. - How did you find me? - Look. Part of my job for Sam is to ensure his and Jack's personal safety. So, that includes looking into people in their lives. - So you're stalking me. - No. No, come on. Casey, I'm here for Sam. He wanted to come talk to you himself, but with everything that's happened, he didn't wanna bring any more attention to you than necessary. Sam feels bad that your chat yesterday got cut short and he wanted me to invite you over, so you two can finish your conversation, but Sam was thinking that you all could have dinner together tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah. Unless you'd rather hang out with the paparazzi. (soft music) - [Jack] Casey. - Hey Jack. How are you? Are you all right? - [Jack] Yeah, I'm okay. - Jack, don't you have something you wanna say to Casey? - Oh yeah. Thank you for helping me. - Of course. I will help you any time you ever need all right. - Should we show her inside, bud? - Yeah. Come on. Over here's the dining room and upstairs is my play area. - Wow. - I don't mean to be rude but I gotta talk to Mark for a second. Do you mind excusing us? - Oh, of course. - Thank you. Mark. - [Jack] Casey, come check this out. - Okay. - Sam look. This is not the time for a new romance. I don't. We don't know anything about this girl. - Let me worry about that. Have you heard from Bruner? - He said he might have a lead but. - But what? - She's still out there. Two days ago was the first time she popped her head up in weeks. Before that nothing, not even a tweet. All right Sammy, we are trying to find her. - You need to find her. It's been six months. I can't be worried about my career and my son and if you could do your job or not. Come on. - Look, I've been trying. - [Sam] Try harder. - Hey, I do everything you ask me. You want me to pick up the girl. I did. You want me to find the crazy bitch. That's what I'm doing. - Keep your voice down. I don't care what it takes. You and Bruner need to find her, so she doesn't do anything else. Is that clear? - Yeah. - No one is taking my son away from me. No one. - My mom used to read to me there when I was little. And that's the TV where we watch my movies. My mom said it had to be big so my movies look really real. You know? - Uh huh. - This is the couch. We do not eat on it. Dad's rules. - I will be sure to remember. - Come on. You can see the kitchen next. They call this an island which I think is funny because there's no water. - They call it an island, bud, because it's out here in the middle all alone whether there's water or not. Say bye to Mark, Jack. - Bye Mark. - Take care, buddy. You guys have fun. - Bye. - Casey, do you want some apple juice? I don't get to have soda but you probably could since you're a guest. - I'll tell you what? Why don't you go wash up and I'll grab Casey a drink? - Okay. - Your home is really beautiful. - Thanks. It's a little big for just two of us, but what are you gonna do? Now we do have apple juice but I was thinking something a little more grown up. - [Casey] Oh yes, grape juice. Isn't it? - I think it is. Do you mind? - Of course. - I'm sorry if Mark coming over earlier was a bit invasive. - Oh actually it worked out for the best that he was there. - Mark's a bit rough around the edges but he means well. We grew up together so he's just being a bit protective. Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh and I'm sorry about all that paparazzi stuff earlier. - Don't be. It's not like you planned it. - Yeah. - I'm done, Dad. Can I go play? - Finished. You're finished. - Thanks. - I don't think he quite got it. Hey, I think you're forgetting something. - [Jack] Thanks for coming over, Casey. - [Casey] Thank you, Jack. You were a lovely host. - 30 minutes then it's lights out. You got it? - [Jack] Yes sir. - I'm coming to check on you. - Rolling. Are we speeding? Sound speed. Alpha take two. Marker. And action. I know you came here to stop me but you are too late. Not a chance, slime ball. No, don't hurt me. I'm just a villain taking over the world. Is there anything wrong with that? Yes, yes there is. This is my territory. Either get out or else I will crush you. I will protect my world. - You have a great kid. - Yeah and he's obviously on his best behavior because you're over here. No, I know. I know I'm lucky. It's just I worry about him. With everything that's just happened to his mom. - I'm so sorry, Sam. - Yeah, thank you. It's just. How do you even begin to talk to a child about murder? Anyway that's why I left so abruptly the other day. I had to talk to the police. - Do they have any suspects? - So far the woman who tried to take Jack is the prime suspect. - And if you come here again trying to take my territory or kill anymore of my family, you will suffer. - Which is actually something I wanna talk to you about. I'm taking Jack out of school just temporarily for his own safety 'til this whole thing gets resolved. - Well if it's a matter of his safety, you obviously have to do what is best. - What is it? - Jack's been through a lot this year. You know keeping a certain level of consistency in an educational environment is really important at his age. - That's actually what I wanted your help with. As you say, consistency is important. You're Jack's favorite teacher and I want you to come aboard and home school him full time for the rest of the year or longer. I think that Jack would really benefit from having you around. - Oh. Well, I wasn't expecting that. - I think you guys have a great connection and I did some checking up on you, and I've heard nothing but good things. So, what do you say? - To be honest, I was hoping the school was gonna offer me a full time position next fall. Quitting mid way through the year would not send the best message. - I understand but if it's a financial thing, I mean you'll be well compensated, especially considering how much time you'll need to be spending around me. I mean, in that case you better be paying a lot. - I can't believe you showed up here. I am the titan here. You will not take my territory. You have your own territory on your island where you are the titan. You have peace and I have peace. - In all seriousness, I'm sure you would be more than generous. I would just love some time to think about. - Yeah, of course. Just don't think too long. I wanna make a decision very soon and you're my first choice. - [Jack] 'Cause I know you are the titan of that world, too. - [Sam] Hey Jack, come say bye to Casey. - Okay. All right let's take five. Cut. (soft music) - Thank you, Sam. I'm really glad I came out. - So am I. Goodnight, Casey. - Goodnight. - Let my driver take you home and make sure the paparazzi's gone. You have my number so let me know soon about working with Jack okay? - Okay. I will. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (soft music) (dog barking) (soft music) Sam. Hey. Sorry if it's too late. I was thinking about your offer and if it's you know we work out a few details, I think I would like to take it. (soft music) (phone buzzing) - Hello? - [TJ] Oh my god. Have you seen it? - Seen what? - Check on the link I just sent you. I'm on my way. Make me some coffee. - Okay. Oh no. - [Mark] Who authorized this? All PR is supposed to run through me. How did this get posted? No, we need to take this down immediately. - [Sam] It's fine. It's innocent and she looks great. - Now is not the time for this much press. - But this is good press. Casey is great for my image. She's the girl next door. I mean the studio's gonna love this. - I don't care about your love life. I'm trying to make sure Lynette doesn't screw things up. - Marky, relax. Pretty soon I'll be shooting Vindicators and that woman will be behind bars. - Or dead. - Sure. That makes our life even easier. - I really hope you're right about this. I don't wanna have to clean up another mess of yours. - And so I just decided screw it. I called him back and I said yes. Now that gives me the time to figure things out. Plus Sam has been super sweet about everything. - Wow. - What? - You are totally crushing on Sam Austin. - What? No. - What? Yes. - Stop. I just think a bird in hand is worth two in the bush in this case. - What the hell does that even mean? - It means the job with Sam is a sure thing and what if the school isn't? Unless they offer me a full time job, which with this kind of publicity doesn't seem too likely. - You do realize that this kind of publicity is exactly what you're gonna get if you and Sam become an item? - Fortunately Sam isn't interested in me, so I don't have to worry about us becoming an item. - But you're totally crushing. - You're right. I'm totally crushing. - I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you all morning. Oh my god. It's him. What do I do? - What do you mean what do you do? Answer it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? - Be cool. - Yeah. - [TJ] Yeah. - Hello. - Hey, it's Sam. Look, there is a story about us with pictures from dinner last night. It's total nonsense but I just wanted to warn you about it. - Oh that. Yeah, I saw that this morning. - I'm really sorry. We're gonna take care of everything. - No totally. I guess Hollywood's a small town. - Yeah, it gets smaller everyday. What are you doing today? - Actually my friend TJ and I were just trying to figure that out. - Go look out your front door. - Look out my front door. - It was gonna be a surprise for saying yes to the job, but I guess now would also act as an apology. I booked you a day at a private spa. You can take your friend TJ if you want. - Yes. Say yes. - So nice of you. Totally not necessary. - Well, it's already taken care of, so I don't wanna hear another word about it. You have fun okay? - Say thank you, Sammy. We love you, Sammy. - Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. - Okay come on. Bye Sam. Thank you, Sam. Bye. - Bye. (suspenseful music) (moves into gentle music) - Thank you. (camera shutter clicking) - That massage was wow. - Right? Now this is a life we should be living. Hashtag Sunday fun day. - Enjoy it while it last. - Casey, if you play your cards right, this could be your life. - Please, this is Sam Austin we're talking about. Need I remind you his wife was Naomi Tills. - I heard the way he was talking to you. (suspenseful music) Okay but serious question. Are you ready to be a stepmom? - Oh my gosh. - Because that kid's gonna need some serious therapy. His dad's about to be a superhero, his mother was murdered, and he was almost kidnapped by a lunatic stalker who is still on the loose mind you. - Well at least Jack's safe now and Sam has tons of security. I'm sure they'll find her soon enough. - Who knows what that woman is capable of? (suspenseful music) - You look so pretty in this. (suspenseful music) - So cute. - Thank you. His hair smells like butter. - [Casey] They just smell like butter to you. - [TJ] I got more than his number, honey. Tell Sam I want that every week. - Oh my god. (soft music) - I'm gonna call the cops. (soft music) (phone buzzing) - Hey, how'd it go? What wait? Calm down. What happened? Stay there. I'm gonna send Mark over. We're gonna take care of everything. - Hey. What do you think? - These guys don't anything but I'm positive it was her. - Let's find her. I'm sick of dealing with this. - Don't worry. We'll find her before the cops do. That way then she can't tell 'em what really happened. - Perfect. Anything in there? - Nah, just some fingerprints. Nothing that they don't already have. - Okay. What next? - Well, a neighbor across the street got a license plate number. They don't know yet but I'm gonna go follow up on that. - That's what I need to hear. - All right don't worry about it. We got it. - Hey. You doing okay? Detective Bruner is pretty certain this was the woman who tried to kidnap Jack. - Great. What am I gonna do now? - That's all taken care of. Grab what you need. I'm gonna take you to Sam's 'til this all blows over. You'll be safe. - [TJ] Hey Casey. - I'm sorry. Who are you? - Who am I? Who are you? - [Mark] Casey isn't able to talk right now. - Mark, I'm sorry. This is my friend, TJ. She was with me when this all happened. - Yeah Mark. - I'm sorry. We really need to get going before the news gets here. - Hey Mark. I'd like to talk to my friend for a minute okay. - Sorry. Could you just give us a minute please? - Please. - I'll go get the car. - [Casey] Thanks. - What is he talking about go and get the car? - Sam wants me to come to his place. He thinks it'll be safer there. - I don't know. I don't trust him. I heard him outside whispering with some detective out there. Something about not wanting the police to know things. - I'm sure they just don't want the press to hear about this. Look TJ, they have a point. Staying at Sam's would be the safe choice. You know until this all blows over. - Just come stay with me. - I mean, look at this place. What if she comes over and does this to your apartment? - How is she gonna find me? - How did she find me? I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something like this happened to you, too. - I don't like this, Case. - [Casey] But you know I'm right. - All right fine but as soon as this is over, you're coming and you're staying with me. - I promise. - And you're gonna call me immediately if you need anything. Okay? - You're a good friend, TJ. - I know. Come here. - Casey, I am so sorry. You don't deserve to be dragged into this after everything you've done. Are you okay? - [Casey] Yeah. - You came back. - Sure did. - Come check out your room. - Why don't you guys go inside? I'll be right behind you. - Okay. Come on. - Your room is pretty awesome. Come on, Casey. - Okay I'm coming. - The guest bedroom is awesome. - This is the guest room? - [Jack] You like it? - I do. Wow. - I told you. It's pretty good. Just make sure you make the bed just like this every morning. - More rules. - I guess. Dad hates messy beds. - No messy beds. Got it. Anything else? - Dinner's at 6:30 and bedtime's at 8:30. - For everyone? - I don't know. You're a lot older so dad might let you stay up later than me. - I think we'll let Casey choose her own bedtime, bud. - Old people get to do all the good stuff. - Here's a tip, buddy. Never call a woman old. Go finish setting the table. - Yes sir. - I saw you packed pretty light. - Yeah, there wasn't much left to pack. - I'm sorry about that. Look in the closet. I had a friend of mine at the studio who's in wardrobe, they got a bunch of stuff that I thought you'd look good in and I had to estimate the sizes, but I think it'll be all right. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. I want you to feel at home. I'll let you get settled. Take a shower, get dressed. Dinner should be ready when you're done. - Sam. Thank you. (soft music) ♪ There's no other feeling when I'm next to you ♪ ♪ No one else around ♪ ♪ Just a space for two ♪ - He's asleep. Finally. - I didn't think you were coming back. - I'm just gonna grab a coaster for that. - I'm sorry. Jack even told me about that. - No, it's okay. Naomi could never remember either. Wow. I'm sorry I keep bringing her up. It's just. - No, no worries. I can't even imagine how difficult that must be for you both. I lost my dad when I was Jack's age. - You did? - Yeah, it was really hard for my mom and I, but having my mom be there and the strong person she is, it really made everything better. And I don't know. Look at me. I think I turned out okay. - I think you did, too. - I know it feels like a huge part of you is missing and that's never gonna get better, but you and Jack are gonna become closer because of this and he's a great kid and he's really lucky to have you as a dad. - Thank you. That means a lot. And your mom, she sounds like a pretty amazing woman. - Yeah. Yeah, she is. - What is it? - It's nothing. Yeah. - Casey, you can tell me. - My mom had a stroke a while back and she's having a really tough recovery. - Oh my god. - I feel so helpless. I don't know if she's gonna be okay and the bills are just piling up and the worst part is I don't even know if she's you know gonna wake up and remember who I am. - I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? - Thank you but no. I just need to be strong and not give up. - Then we won't give up because I'm gonna be right by your side all the way through. - Thank you, Sam. That's really sweet. - You look beautiful in that dress tonight. - Thank you. I don't think I've worn a dress since prom. It's late. - Yeah, it is late. You should get some rest. - Yeah. - And I'll take these to the kitchen. And if you need anything at all tonight, you know where to find me. - Thank you.

I had a bad dream and I can't sleep. - Okay. I'm coming. All right. How 'bout I take you to your room and read you a story until you fall asleep? How does that sound? - Good. - Okay, come on. (soft music) - Yeah okay great. This is not gonna come down to me. Do you understand? What do I pay you for? Find her. Put the gun in the car then call the cops. Easy. Okay great. Now take care of this evidence situation before it gets out of hand all right. Look I gotta go. Just do what I'm telling you. You're up. - [Casey] I'm up. - Good. So some good news about your case. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, they got some fingerprints from your place. Her name is Lynette Marris and they're looking for her now. - [Casey] Great. - Bruner's pretty good at finding someone once he sets his mind on it. - That's good. - Yeah. So look, Sam wanted me to give you some instructions for today. - I'm sorry. Instructions? - Yeah, he wants you to get Jack up and dressed. Make sure he showers. And after you make him breakfast, you need to work with him. Develop a lesson plan for your tutoring. - I'm a little confused. - Look Sammy prefers it so make it happen. - [Casey] Where is Sam? - Studio. Meeting for Vindicators. Speaking of meetings, I need to get going. I left some numbers on the island counter if you need anything. You know actually these meetings are very important for Sam. So it's probably best if you don't even bother him at all today. Call me if you need something. Don't call Sam. - Good morning to you, too. - Good morning, Casey. - Good morning, Jack. Did you sleep all right after I tucked you back in? - Yeah. - All right the big question is what are we gonna eat for breakfast? - I can have fruit or yogurt with a healthy cereal for breakfast. - I think we should have pancakes. - My mom used to make me pancakes, but dad said I can only have them now on special occasions. - Oh. Well, this is our first breakfast together. I think that's pretty special. Isn't it? - [Jack] I guess so. - All right, pancakes it is. And I could give you a couple books I think you might like since you like to read. How does that sound? - [Jack] Would you read them with me if I need any help? - Yes. - Good. I liked it when my mom would read with me. (phone buzzing) - Jack, could you just give me a minute? This is Casey. She's awake. Now. Okay yes. Yes, I'm gonna be right there. Okay. Jack. We're going on a little field trip. - Field trip? - Yes. Come on let's go. Okay. Dammit. I'm sorry. - It's okay. My dad says it sometimes, too. What's wrong? I just realized I don't have my car and I really need it. - Where we going? - Somewhere really important, Jack. It's an emergency. I have to go see my mom. - I have an idea. My dad keeps the key to his car here for the driver. - Oh but I can't. Jack, I shouldn't drive your dad's car. - But it's an emergency. - Now she has a lot of progress to make and it won't be easy on either of you. - But she's awake? - Yes. - And she asked for me? - Yes. It's a really good sign. (soft music) - That's it, ladies. It's official. Sam Austin is in love. We caught up with him outside of Cafe Unreal earlier this afternoon and managed to get this out of him. - [Reporter] Hey, hey Sam, Sam. Tell us about Casey. - Casey's wonderful. - [Reporter] Is it serious? When did she move in? - No comment. (soft music) - Excuse me. Miss Wright. First of all, I wanted to tell you how happy I was to hear that your mother took such a huge step towards her recovery today. - Thank you. - And I wanted to say personally how much I appreciate that you not only made your account current, but paying us in advance for next month. I'm glad we're gonna be able to continue to help your mother. Thank you. - I don't care what you have to do. I want them found now. Nevermind, they just walked in. I'm gonna call you back. - Dad, guess where we went. - Go to your room. - Sam, you're never gonna guess what just happened. - Go to your room, Jack. Now. - I can explain. - You take my son and steal my car. - I know this looks really bad. - Every time he leaves this house, he's at risk. What were you thinking taking Jack somewhere without telling me? Who the hell do you think you are? - It was. Sam, it was my mother. She woke up and she asked for me. - I don't care if your mother suddenly got up and started dancing. Nobody takes my son anywhere without my say so. Do you understand me? We're gonna finish this conversation later. I can't even look at you right now. (gentle music) (moves into suspenseful music) - You. You shouldn't be here. You're ruining everything. Shut up. I know what you're trying to do and it won't work. Sam said that we'd be married when the time is right and there is nothing you can do to stop it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You think I won't kill for him. - Casey. - Liar. You promised me. You said to be patient and now you're with her. - Dad? - Jack, go to your room. Jack, go back to your room. Now. - I don't know who you are or what you want, but if you just put down the knife, we can discuss this. - You said we'd be married. You said I'd be Jack's mom. You said we'd be happy together forever. - I'm sorry but I've never met you. (suspenseful music) - Liar. (suspenseful music) - Stay there. No, it's not mine. I thought you could use something strong. Mark just finished up talking to the police. Thanks for your help with Jack. I didn't think he was gonna get to sleep. - She was so far gone. I mean. She said you promised you would marry her. She really believed you guys were in a relationship together. That's frightening. - That's because she's crazy. I mean, think about what she did to your place. She's just someone who made up a fantasy in her head that had horrible, horrible consequences. Casey, I owe you an apology. What I said earlier about your mother, that was awful of me. - Yeah. Yeah, it was. - And it's not an excuse but I just. I was just really scared for my son. He's all I have left in this world. He's the only thing that matters to me. Not my career, not money, not fame. - Sam, I would never hurt Jack. Never. - I know. And I obviously I want nothing more than for your mother to make a full recovery, which is why I paid for her treatment. - Thank you but I can't accept that and I will pay you back. - No, there's no need. I wanna do it. - I can't. - What's wrong? - [Casey] I should go. - Why? - I think I should stay with TJ for a little while. Just get away from all of this craziness. - Let's get out of here. - What? - Yeah, first thing in the morning. Just the three of us. We'll get out of here. We'll go up to the mountains. I have a cabin. I've been going there since I was a little kid. We'll just go up there and forget about all this. Nothing but sunshine, mountains. Peaceful. - That sounds perfect. (soft music) - [Jack] Come on. - [Casey] I'm coming. - Hey, let me grab that. - Okay, thank you. - You're all set? - Yeah. - [Jack] Get in, Casey. (soft music) - So far so good. - All right. Keep me posted. - Will do. (soft music) You guys have fun. (soft music) - [Sam] Here we are. - This is really cute. - Yeah, it was my mom's before she passed away. She loved it here. - [Jack] Dad, can we go fishing? - [Sam] Tomorrow we will go fishing. Today we're gonna relax. Rest up. We'll meet you inside. - [Jack] Okay. (phone dinging) - [Sam] Can I get your bag? - Oh, I got it. I'm just gonna call TJ back and I'll meet you inside. - Okay. - The Los Angeles District Attorney now considers the Naomi Tills murder investigation closed after it appears that obsessed fan, Lynette Marris, is the one who gunned her down six months ago. - Based on new evidence, a revolver that was used to murder Naomi Tills, was found in Lynette Marris' vehicle. The vehicle and weapon were found by Detective Bruner of the Los Angeles Police Department. We consider the inquiry into the matter of Naomi Tills' death closed. - Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe. - Find her. Put the gun in the car then call the cops. - I don't trust him. I saw him whispering with some detective out there. Something about not wanting the police to know things. - [Sam] Hey. - [Casey] Hey. - [Sam] Are you okay? - [Sam] Dad, I'm hungry. - We're gonna eat in a minute. Go put your stuff away, bud. - Fine. - What's wrong? - I. - Hey, come here. What is it? - They announced they closed Naomi's case. - Yeah. Yeah, Mark told me this morning. - Mark's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. They're closing the case because they found a gun in Lynette's car and the other morning when I was waking up, I overheard Mark talking about the gun and this evidence situation. - What? - And the strange thing is just Lynette didn't use a gun when she broke into your house. Is that weird? - I'm not sure that I get what you're saying. - If she had a gun, wouldn't she have used a gun? She attacked us with a knife. - What are you getting at? - How much do you trust Mark? - With my life. - Nevermind. I'm sorry. - He's my best friend, Casey. Look, I appreciate the concern. I do. But you gotta trust me. Mark had nothing to do with Naomi's death. - [Jack] Dad, I'm starving. - Can we have a good time now? - Yeah. - Come on. (soft music) - Smells good. - And it is going to taste good. - Is there anything I can help with? - No, no, no. There's nothing you can help with. You can go in the other room and relax. I'll bring us a drink. - Okay. (soft music) Hey, what are you doing? - Watching movie of Mom I did before. - [Casey] May I see? - If you want. - More movies? Dinner's gonna be ready in 10. - Okay. - Oh gosh, tonight was so great though. Cheers to you, darling. - Hey, to us. - To us. - [Jack] Mom, dad. - Jack okay. With that camera. If you're gonna film us, come a little closer. Make sure you get us both in the frame. Good. Look at him. - You look beautiful in that dress tonight. - Sam. - Doesn't Mommy look beautiful in that dress, Jack? You look beautiful in that dress tonight. Hey Jack, come here a second. - Yes sir. Hold this. (soft music) - But this is good press. Casey is great for my image. She's the girl next door. Studio's gonna love this. - I don't care about your love life. - I don't know who you are or what you want, but if you just put down the knife. - Liar. (soft music) You have to promise me. I cannot be lied to again. I cannot take another one of your lies. - Honey, I am not lying. Of course I promise. We just we can't go public until everything's taken care of. - [Lynette] Are you sure this is the only way? I don't want. I don't want. - It is the only way. After you do this, we get to be together. Do you love me? - Yeah, of course. - Then you need to do this. - But I've never. - She wants to take him away from us. You wanna me a mommy, don't you? This way you'll get to have a child of your own with me. Doesn't that sound great? - Yeah. - Just make sure you do it quick and then get out of there. Mark will meet you in the desert and he'll get rid of the gun. Can you do this? Good. That's a good one. I mean, it's not my best performance, but I thought it was believable. - She wasn't lying. That's what she meant when she said she would kill for you. You had her kill Naomi. - Yeah, Lynette really would've done anything for me. God, I'm gonna miss her. You know, Naomi bought him that tablet. She taught him how to take video in hopes that someday he'd become a filmmaker. It's ironic, isn't it? She was always doing things like that without my permission, even after she rode my coattails to stardom. - So you killed her? - What? - Stay there, Jack. - Stay back. - I would've let her walk away, too. I mean, she would've been washed up without me anyway. I'm Sam Austin. Who the hell is she, right? But she just wouldn't go away quietly. She had to try to take Jack away from me. Do you have any idea how that would look? - So you killed her? - If you know anything about me, you know that I would never let anybody take Jack away from me. Never. (dramatic music) - Go, hide. (dramatic music) Run, Jack. Run. (dramatic music) - Ah. Casey. - [Casey] Run. - Jack, come back. Jack, I need you. (dramatic music) Give me Jack or I'll kill you. Jack. - [Casey] This way. (dramatic music) - You can't hide out here. Jack. (suspenseful music) Jack, come back. Jack. Where are you, buddy? - Casey, I'm scared. - I know. I know but it's gonna be okay. - [Sam] Jack, buddy. - Jack, remember what we do when there's an emergency at school? - 911? - Yes, okay. Your dad's not really feeling well right now and I need you to call 911. - Me? - Yes. Tell them we need the police here. Okay? When I go away, I need you to count to 10. Then you're gonna run as fast as you can and you're gonna call. - Don't leave me. - It's gonna be okay, all right. I promise. Okay. - [Sam] Casey. Casey, come back. Where are you? Jack. - It's gonna be okay. Start counting. - One. Two. Three. Four. - Can't hide forever. - [Casey] Sam. I'm over here. - Not gonna hurt you. Just need to talk. Making a huge mistake. If you just do what I tell you to do, I promise we can put all of this behind us. - Lynette and your ex wife. - You're not like them. You're special, Casey. Together we can be unstoppable. - What? - You're gonna be my new wife. You're gonna be Jack's new mom. - You're sick. - I thought you were perfect, but now I gotta get rid of you, too. - Dad, stop. (suspenseful music) - So the LAPD just found Mark Haynes. He's been placed under arrest. Can you believe this guy? I was a huge Sam Austin fan. - Hey. So glad you two are okay. Hey Jack. - Hey guys. Jack's aunt Meredith is on her way to pick him up, so you're free to go if you'd like. - No, I'm gonna stay. - Yeah. Hey there, buddy. You did the right thing giving us a call like you did. You are quite a hero. Yeah. - Hey Sheriff. - Yeah. - Need you over here for a second. - Excuse me, guys. (soft music) - Bye. - Hi Jack. - [Jack] Hi Casey. - Is that your Aunt Meredith? Wow, she looks just like your mom. Are you excited to be back? - Sure. - I'm so excited to have you back here. All right, I'll see you inside, okay? - Okay. (soft music) (moves into bright music)
