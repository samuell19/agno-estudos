What did the 7th Company do after he died? 7th Intruder Company... finish and captivate... enemy forces that are 6 times their number. The enemy bunker that should be.... holding our troops for over a year ... could only hold the 7th Company for half a day. Our vanguard lies in enemy defense territory.

Kuberitahu ya. You'll know if they accept you... when you are on the battlefield. Cracked eggs... destined to be eaten. If you could crack the egg from the inside, maybe you're an eagle.

Currently... the 38th, 39th, and 40th Corps.... already gathered in the Chongchon River. You must finish as soon as possible the deployment in the Changjin Lake war zone.

The 20th Corps will separate and surround the enemy.... di Koto-ri, Yudam-ni, dan Hagaru-ri. Make sure the 27th Corps focus on their fire... to finish off U.S. forces at Sinhung-ni. Ready! After the 27th Corps took out 2 large groups of enemies,... immediately destroy the airport in Hagaru-ri... and cut off enemy air communications. In addition, stop the enemy who wants to strengthen the north. Ready. Where is the 27th Corps now? They had arrived at the specified location. Order the 27th Corps to take cover and get ready.... so that we can prevent the enemy from escaping to the south... Where is the 26th Corps now?

What is the lowest temperature tonight? 40 °C below zero. We're not just going to war against America. We are also at war with God. General, we received reports of such a strong Chinese attack... in Tokchon and Nyongwon. That's far more than G2 expected. Four other supplies are also being worked on.

MacArthur even said they would ... crossing the Yalu River before the New Year ... so that their troops could go home for the holidays. Nonsense, they want to go home on vacation? I won't let them go home. You miss mom? Qianli, when Baili died, are you with him? Half of his body was crushed... because of the explosion. I can't put his intestines back in, no matter how hard I try. He says cold. I hugged him. Her lips... purple. I can't stop... the bleeding. He asked me... to help kill him. Qianli, let me stay beside you. If I end up like Baili, you have to help me too. 26 November 1950 How are things? Tank, Half-tracks, and headquarters. Judging from the direction and acceleration of movement.... The 31st Corps led by US troops ... we can predict that the enemy base... will be erected in the vicinity of the 1100 mountains. They are nicknamed "Polar Bears". They fought in Siberia in World War I ... and in the Pacific in World War II. This is their trump card. We'll show them ... how hard is our current attack. Why hasn't anything happened yet? You think something's wrong? The 59th, 79th, and 89th Divisions arrived at Yudam-ni just in time. The 80th and 81st divisions were in Sinhung-ni's position. What is the speed of the Smith corps? 3 kilometers per day. They move very slowly. According to their line of travel and geography, The Smith Corps must have been prepared for attack. Then we can break their line up into sections. We have to kill Smith at Changjin Lake. Let's just wait. The 1100 mountains are right in front of us. If we get there before the sun rises, we can repel US troops. Don't waste our time here. Tell all the teams. Getting ready to leave. / Ready. Gather your gear and get ready to go. Attention everyone! Get ready to go. She. I give this to you. Do what? Why do you have such evil thoughts? The battle with the Polar Bear is a tough one. Let me be with Wanli. You gave it to me yourself. Now you want to take it. What do you want? The throw is accurate. That's useful to me. Take good care of him. When this war ends, I will adopt him as my adopted son. I hope he will take care of me when I am old. You old bastard, if you adopt him as your adopted son, what do you call me? Call me Daddy. I want to break your porous teeth. Remember, once the battle begins, stay side by side with your brother. He is more intelligent and cunning than a rabbit. The average bullet is rarely about it. Don't show off. Try to fight well.

The plane opens its tail... and rained bullets and bombs. After that, our people in yellow uniforms... fell one by one. What do we call our brothers... who died in the war? We call them what freezes to death... after walking for 6 days and nights ... without food and sleep? What about those who run up to 10 meters in front of the enemy ... who just wants to throw a grenade in his hand? They died. What do we call them? It's not called a hero who never freezes to death, let alone people who weren't killed. A soldier only lives for honor and glory. What do you want me to call you? 677th Soldier, Wu Wanli. "Wan" means ten thousand. Careful. Very sophisticated. USA planes are coming! They will rise! USA planes! Seek refuge! God save us! Spread! Good USA! are you okay? What's your name?

So painful. Do not... Do not... Don't leave me here alone. Why do you want to be a soldier? Let Qianli respect me. What do you mean? You could say great... if your enemy respects you. Lei Suisheng. It won't hurt anymore. It won't hurt anymore. You've done well, Lei. Let me. When I came home last time, When I came out, people were nodding and smiling at me. I don't know them but they recognized my army uniform. Before I left the house, my daughter asked, "Father, why do you have to go to war?" If we don't fight, our next generation will go to war. We risk our lives... in order to fight for a peaceful life for them. My mom keeps looking at me... without saying a word... when I leave the house. I know.... he doesn't want me to go. My wife said... when i come back, I have to teach our daughter how to count. We have to win the war... and take them home. US Army Forces at Hagaru-ri Airport Forced to Retreat.

The resistance of persistent people like this ... we are not destined to win. 105,000 US 10th Corps troops evacuated from Hungnam Port. The 9th Corps occupied Hungnam Harbor. The Battle of Changjin Lake is the perfect example... to annihilate the US-reinforced regiment... during the War to Resist US Aggression and Help Korea, causing major U.S. forces on the eastern front to experience ... "The biggest setback in Marine Corps history." During the second battle in the war ... to Reject US Aggression and Help Korea, The 9th Corps achieved significant strategic results on the main battlefield... on the eastern front during the Battle of Changjin Lake. While working with our troops on the western front, These brave soldiers completely crushed Macarthur's arrogant plan to "end the war before Christmas" and sending the US-led "UN Command" from the Yalu River pushed to the other side of the 38th Parallel. The battle completely changed the scale of the Korean War... and became the foundation for the final victory of the War to Reject US Aggression and Assist Korea. More than 197,000 Chinese heroes sacrificed their lives during the war. Over 300,000 heroes including Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, etc. and 6,000 meritorious troops arrived.
