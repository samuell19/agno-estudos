On their rent too, for that matter. It's part of being an artist. One point or another, you know? Music is not about being reliable. It's about being unpredictable. - Yeah, that's one way to look at it. But if I don't pay George I'm gonna have to move back to North Central Valley. Hey.

Hey, you should totally jump on stage with us, man. - Oh, yeah. - We're about to play another set. - No, I haven't picked up a guitar in years. - Don't need rehearsal, man. Once you have it, you never lose it. - Come on, it'll be fun. We love jam sessions during our live shows. - Come on, have a little fun, be spontaneous. - Hey, Tom's not really the spontaneous type. He's more like the serious, logical, getting stuff done kind of guy. He's not gonna just jump up on stage and play the guitar. - Well, okay. Well, we'll see you around. - Hey, I'll see you up there, huh? - Right, now, all right, bye. - Hey. I should get-- - Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow?

Now they called this the every man's fair because the idea was to show average people all the latest developments being designed to help improve the welfare of the masses. - Now to me the most interesting exhibit at the fair was the Westinghouse time capsule. They put all sorts of stuff in there representative of 1939: magazines, cigarettes, a film news reel all for someone to uncover in 5,000 years. Is your class putting together a time capsule on graduation night? - Nope. - Mm-mm. - A few of us from my graduating class made one. - What was in it? - You know what? I don't really remember.

Where'd you get that from? - Uh-- - Wild Oaks Amusement Park. - Tom was afraid of heights. - Still am by the way. - Okay, Tom is afraid of heights. But I got him to ride the Ferris wheel, and as luck would have it... - We got stuck at the very top for like a good 10 minutes. - I said to him, "Are you okay?" And he said, no matter what the situation, so long as I was sitting next to him, everything was worth it. - Aw, that is so sweet, you guys! - Anyway, when we got off, Tom insisted on winning a stuffed animal for me, so. It was actually really hard putting it in the time capsule and giving it away, but I figured if Tom could overcome his fear of heights... I could sacrifice this guy. I remember that! - Whoa, is that from prom? - Yeah, I so remember putting that in there. - It's an awesome photo. - Thanks. Ugh, I still cannot believe that Tom organized the whole marching band, and the cheerleaders. He put up the balloons just to ask you to the dance, girl. - Yeah, it was pretty elaborate. - Hey, what can I say? - And I... put this in. - Trucker Bob? - Trucker Bob?

Schedule some extra rehearsals, you know, like, really put the pedal to the metal. - I think if anything we should probably rehearse less, just take more risks and chill, you know? - First of all, I think we need to revamp your website. Your current one looks like it was made with geocities, and that's not mobile friendly. So I made a new version. It's a little bit more modern. You like it? - Wow, impressive. "Lenny's Vinyl Vault, pre-owned vintage records." Nice. - Thanks, it's linked to social media platforms so we can post things every day like your new music, and events, and artist appearances stuff like that. Oh, and I highly suggest that we bring someone on to design an app to curate all of it. - This all sounds really complicated. - All these businesses do it nowadays; it's fine. - How does this sell music? - Marketing. We can't sell music if no one knows about the store, right? - Fair enough. - Still at it, huh, Rod? - Well, I can't enlighten young minds if I can't speak the language. Oh, how was the unveiling of the lustrous time capsule. Was it? - It was interesting. - Well, you know the old Chinese proverb?

I mean, think about it. It makes no business sense whatsoever to make streaming music available for free at the same time as available to buy! Sorry. I must be talking your ear off about this stuff. - No, no, you're not. I'm interested.

Well, for the same reason the World's Fair had a time capsule. Because our past is a window into our future. Now as you can see I've decided to initiate a time capsule for your class. So what I want you to do is, before the last day I want you to bring in one item that you feel best represents who you are. This will be your final homework assignment. Thanks, everybody. - Mr. Paxton, how did you decide what to put into your time capsule? - You know, I picked something that was really meaningful to me at the time. A memory that I didn't want to take for granted or forget. Think about your item as a note to your future self, a reminder of what's important to you right now. Does that help? - Sounds pretty cool. I like this assignment. Thanks, Mr. Paxton. See you. - Yeah, I'll see you. - All right, guys, get close. Come on, say cheese. - Cheese. - Okay. - Dad, can you try and look more normal? - Never was normal. Never want to be normal.

Ready? - Oh, nice. Okay. - We good? - Yeah, I think so. Look it there. You two look great together. - Nice job, Peter. - See? Isn't that nice. - Jane said I can crash with her until I find a new place. - All right, cool, man. - I thought you'd be more excited. This means I don't have to move out to North Central Valley. - It's not like North Central Valley's some other country or something. We'd figure it out, make it work, rearrange shows, you know? - Am I your girlfriend or just your bandmate? - Both. - Yeah, but if I'm gonna spend this much time with someone, I want it to at least be vaguely official. - Really? No, I just didn't think you'd be into something so petty. - Come on, look, I've moved around a lot. I've been on lots of adventures, been carefree, but I think it's time to choose a direction, you know, maybe settle down, find some stability. - Can we just, um, maybe have this conversation after the showcase 'cause-- - What has that got to do with anything? - Because it's just a really big conversation and I don't want to be the shredder of the gig. It's just really important for my career, so. - Well, it's really important for my career too. - I know, relax, you don't have to get so heated. We'll figure it out. - Let's just play. - All right, is that everything? - Yeah, I'm keeping the rest in storage, so we're good. - Cool. - Thank you so much again, Jane. - Yeah, of course. I'm surprised Derek didn't help you move. - Yeah, I didn't ask him. - Oh. - To be honest, I think I'm gonna break things off with him. - Really? Why? - I mean, when we first met, I was so excited to meet someone I had so much in common with. You know, he likes music, and art, and he wrote me this amazing song and no one's ever done that for me before. But... Outside of the band... who am I kidding? - This guy's not ready for a real relationship and I think I am. - Hm, well, I think that is very mature of you, Lauren. - I guess I'm finally growing up. - It's about time. Come here. - Yeah, I mean, they're a great band, but you just don't hear 'em anymore. - Yeah. - Is it just me or has music gotten worse in the last 10 years? Or are we just getting old? - No, it's gotten worse for sure, yeah. - I think people just choose their music taste when they're in high school and then... you know, some things never change. - I don't know. I've gotten pretty into hardcore metal in the last 10 years, so. - Tom Paxton? Big metal head? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah.

Anyway, I mean, I'm hopeful that something good will happen for the band, but if not, I'm just happy that people are listening to my lyrics. - Oh, wow, I didn't know you wrote the songs. - I've been writing a lot. It's really cathartic. For me, it's not about being a rock star, or signing a record deal, or that lifestyle, you know? I'm just happy that people are hearing my words and maybe feeling a little less alone. - That's really cool. - Thanks. I'm writing a book also. It's based on my travel journals.

That's the problem. I need something to drink. - What's going on with you two? - I think we're gonna break up. - Seriously? - Yeah. - You guys ready? - Yeah, man. - Yeah. - All right, from the top. - Bro, you got to do something about Lauren. - What do you mean? - You got to lock that down, or Tender Betty's gonna split. - Why? Did she say something? - She writes all our lyrics, she's our lead guitarist. Fix it. - Okay. - Hey, girl. - This looks amazing. - Oh, thanks. You good? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's dig in. Mm. - Sorry. Tom wants to meet me at the high school tomorrow at 03:00. - Wow, already? - Do you know something about this? - No. - Then why'd you say, "Wow, already?" - I was saying, wow, I want to eat this salad already. Duh. - What did you put in the time capsule? - I have no idea what you're talking about. - It was the prom photo, right? - Um. - What's he planning? - I'm not sure, but it must be something special. - This looks just like our time capsule. I know, look inside. Ta da. - Hm, a good collection. - They're all from 1979. - Oh, we could sell this as a box set. - Exactly, you and your dad can pick your favorite albums and put together a different set for every year. People love recreating their memories, right? Well, now they can do it with the music from that time. - Jane, this is great. It's brilliant. - Thanks. I can help you look for more recent albums if you want. - Absolutely. - Cool. ♪ - Whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it. You guys are good. That was great. Now we just gotta wait. ♪ - Hey. - Derek? - Look, I've been thinking a lot about what you said about making things official. - Really? - Yeah, I'm down if you are. - Derek, this is a really big step, and it's so not you. - Obviously this is important to you. And I don't want to lose you. Look, you don't have to make a decision now. There's no rush, just think about it. - Yeah, I will. - I think it was supposed to be a lot shorter than this. - I got to go. - She'll be here any second. Can you just hold on for, like, 10 more minutes please? - I'm gonna be late to my math tutor. I'm sorry, Mr. Paxton. - Yeah, that's okay. - I have to go, too. My mom's been in the parking lot for, like, 15 minutes. - Me too, Mr. Paxton. I've got softball practice. I'm sorry. - I'm all about doing a thing for teacher, but... ♪ - Okay. ♪ Tom! - Lauren? It's okay, Neil, you can go now. - Okay. Bye. Where have you been? It's 04:15. - I'm sorry. - You know, I got the marching band, and the cheerleaders. Just like when I asked you to prom our senior year. - I'm really sorry. - You can't commit to anything, can you? - It's called life, Tom. - No, it's called set an alarm on your phone or something. - I'm not gonna fight with you. - Well, it's too late, we're fighting now. - You could've called. 7 years ago. I expected you to call. That's the least you could've done. - Hey, you dumped me, remember? And then you left for a different country two days later. If you didn't mean it, you should've called me. - I bought you a plane ticket. Do you know how much of my savings I spent? I was 17. I thought you would be so excited when you got home and you found that ticket in your jacket pocket. I kept picturing your face. I sat by the phone all night. - What? - And when you didn't call, I waited for you at the airport. And when you didn't show up, I swore to myself that you would call, or surprise me in Argentina, but you never did. You broke my heart. I can't--I can't do this. I'm done. ♪ ♪ - Where's the capsule? Where is it? - Fireplace, what's going on, man? ♪ - I don't remember that. What is it? - You know what? I think that it's better that this happened now before we got in too deep. - Yeah, you did what you had to do. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid. - Yeah, except that it took seven years to pull off so it's kind of like the most painful Band-Aid ever, but... - Look, I should've known that he would've been scared and chickened out. I just--I didn't think he'd leave me out to dry like that. - Right. Well... Why didn't you ever tell us about the ticket? - I was too embarrassed. I just couldn't... You know what I was like. - Yeah, I get it. Did you ever think about calling him maybe? - All the time. But, you know, I was stubborn. I felt rejected so I convinced myself he didn't care about me and I just tried to forget about it. - Did he ever say why he never called, or? - No. But I never really gave him a chance to explain. I just need to let go of the past, and move forward. - Yes, absolutely but isn't forgiveness the best way to move forward? We were in high school then, Lauren. We've grown since then. - I think it's a bit late for that. - It's never too late. - I'm so sorry, man. If I didn't make you put something in the time capsule 10 years ago then-- - It's not your fault, man. If I would've seen this ticket, my whole life could've been different. - Who am I kidding? I wouldn't have gone to Argentina. I was too practical for that. - You don't know that. What about the past couple weeks? There's definitely something there. - She's been hurting just as much as I have. The least I could do is give her, her space. I've been asleep for seven years.

That's a big deal. - It's who we are. No drama, remember? - But I feel like maybe it's no drama just because you don't actually care. Which is cool, but just say it. - Jane, you have done a wonderful job. I can't thank you enough. Lenny's Vinyl Vault is full of joy. - Well, it's my pleasure, Mr. Silver, really. - Lauren. - Hey. - Hey, girl. - I just wanted to come by and officially invite you guys to the Triangle Showcase. - Cool. - Thank you. - Mr. Silver? - Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I will be rooting for you in spirit. - Hope you guys can make it. I know that the reunion tour is over, but I really want to keep in touch. - Definitely. - Cool, all right well, I'll see you there and you later. - Wait, Lauren, you know music. Can you settle something? - My dad is convinced that all our time capsules should include what most people would deem as bad music, which I personally think is absurd. Wouldn't you agree? - Yeah, I agree. - Hold on, you have not heard my reason. - All right, Dad, the floor is yours. - It's very simple. We're trying to honestly represent a year in music, but every year had good and bad music. - Can't argue with that. - I mean, if I were gonna make a time capsule about my life, it wouldn't be about just weddings and proms. It'd be about dirty dishes, taxes, sitting in traffic. - Dad, you can't put traffic in a time capsule. - Well, you should. Like I've said, if you want to figure out who your soul mate is, it's the person that you enjoy sitting in traffic with. - Dad, I think you're getting off track. - Oh, you kids. - Hey, I got to get going, but I'll see you guys at the gig. Great to see you, Mr. Silver. - Bye, bye. - Hey, Lenny, Brazilian jazz? - Oh, I'll be right with you, sir. - Peter... I was thinking. - Yeah? - Well, since our job is done here, I would like to ask you to go to Lauren's show. With me. Like on a date. - Are you asking me out? - I mean, only if you want to. - I do. I'd love that. - Well, it took you two long enough. Yeah, way too long. - Back and has, like, rhinestones. You'll see. - Everyone excited for prom? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember my prom. Seems like a lifetime ago. Anyways, I'm still waiting on some of your time capsule items and I just wanted to add, please, handle with care. Believe me. You don't want to choose something you might regret later. Which actually ties in nicely to what we're studying today in class. Anyone want to tell me what I'm talking about? - Yes, Marie. Always Marie. - The past is a window into our future? - Yes, exactly. History repeats itself. If it didn't work then, why would it work now? Yes? - You told us that the time capsule item is supposed to be something that's important to us now, but also is probably a reflection of what's important to us in the future.
