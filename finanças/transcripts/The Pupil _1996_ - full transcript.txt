Forbidden for visitors to remove their frock The journey was not too tiring I hope? What's the weather like in Paris? Wet, I guess. Here we enjoy the sun all year round. Thank you ma'am. Ah, Morgane... I present to you your tutor, Mr Julien Barnes. Where's the candy box? I broke it, Mom. And that's it. It's so depressing, you know? Everything because of a weak heart. This is why school is prohibited for him. So you did never teach? No, ma'am. All your diplomas provided you with no job? - For a few months I sent articles to the "White Review". - No! In this cutting edge magazine, magnificent. - Nothing was published yet, but I still hope. - Good. Look at that light. If I knew how to write, I would tell... ...the story of the light of an autumn day. But it would be terribly boring. As agreed, we provide room and board... ...in exchange for which you'll pay special attention to Morgane. I think you will not be disappointed. You can take up your duties this evening. And what about my pay? I can assure you that everything will be according to the rules. His father will be happy to meet your demands. You'll see him as soon as he returns from London in a few days. My daughters went out but I am sure... ...that you'll get on perfectly with them. - They are very different from this one. - But they try to imitate me. You are very funny. Morgane's witticism is the delight of this house. He is so funny. He's a young genius. But we are all very friendly, you know. So what is the program? Well... I'll try to play the role of the school, and you.... ...you will try to be a herd of 500 grazing donkeys just on your own. I hope you won't make us bray all together. You wouldn't have the upper hand. But I don't want to have the upper hand. To desire that would suggest you are humbled by your position. - This is unacceptable. - On no account. Come see your room. Do not delude yourself, my sisters are only interested in princes. - Which princes? - You'll recognize them. They're prowling around them, talking loudly, as to prove they don't say anything inappropriate. Maybe they try to imitate you. Paula is proud but shows it. As to Louise, she is... transparent. Well, it seems you don't carry them in your heart. Antipathy is unintentional, so is sympathy. Would you really want to settle here? How can you doubt it, after such a description of what awaits me? Sit down! "Vercingetorix minoribus Caesarem itineribus subsequitur"...' "et locum castris deligit paludibus silvisque munitum".... "ab Avarico longe milia passuum XVI" Good. You'll translate this extract of "the Gallic Wars" for me. So let's put them in order. Verbs and nouns. What words do you know? Your ignorance doesn't worry me. But I don't accept insolence. Come on! Translate! Vercingetorix, accordingly... ...followed Caesar to Avaricum... ...but on a shorter journey... ...and stopped to camp... ...16 miles from this place... at a position... ...protected by marsh and woods. You already knew this text? You already betray my trust! Very well. Let's go on with grammar. Give me all... ...second person singular and plural imperfect, perfect, better than perfect... - ...both active and passive tense of the word... - to lie. Mentiebaris, you lied. Mentiebamini, you lied. Mentitus es, you have lied. Mentitus estis, you have lied. Mentitus eras, you had lied. Mentitus eratis, you had lied. Mentire, lies. Who educated you so far? Did you listen to my mother? I am a "young genius". Hey! Ah, the beautiful Marion. Welcome in our midst. These trips exhaust me. - You got my boater? - I was in a hurry, I had no time to buy it. Emily! Oh, girls! "Nicholas Nickleby", "Dickens" for you. "Les Voix intérieures"? There is even a small consignment of Victor Hugo to his editor. For you. - No, I can not... - But allow yourself. - Thank you. - I'm hungry! You can serve , Emilie. You like macaroni and coffee I hope? It's our folly. So, my dear Emma, what's the news? Last night Liliana took her daughter to the theater with Mr. de Marande... ...to show the entire city their happiness before their marriage. They say that when he saw Cecilia for the first time, he went mad. He's a fool. Mr. de Marande will not break with his mistress... ...whom he welcomes in black satin sheets. - Jealous? My dear girl Louise, marriage obliges a certain prudery. That's why we prefer taking a young woman for a wife over... ...loving an old mistress with whom we allow ourselves everything. Paula is right, that a man whom all the women of Nice swoon over, keeps a small and ugly mistress for 5 years, is because she has great control over him. Or there are crimes between them. Treat yourself, Julien. You see, I aspire to be a close friend of my children. And I watch for every opportunity to participate in their well-being. This is why I travel to London and elsewhere. This constant vigilance is the rule of life... ...and... the real occupation of the whole family. I wish to make it clear that if we are serious peo... Go ahead Emily! That we are serious people, our fortune, although satisfactory for serious people... ...demands to be managed with the utmost attention. What are your expectations? - Seven thousand francs. - Per year? - Yes. - That's extremely modest, I offer you ten thousand. What do you think? Thank you, sir. What is this? The palace of a thousand savors. And it was you who made it? Soon it will fill the whole house. I'll entrap everyone inside. And why do you want to entrap people? Morgane! I believe he is at the fountain, back there. Thank you. It was a jay. You scared it off. I got up at sunrise to see it. Come on! To your room! You keep playing the teacher! You think that's the way to find out about life? Hello. You speak like a child, Morgane. I'm speaking about my responsibility towards your parents. - I'm talking about an adult problem. - And what is an adult problem? It's complicated. It's... it's impossible to explain. I don't know how long I have left to live, so why pretend? I am delighted that school is prohibited for you. Very true! It would teach me to gauge the others and to feel superior. You might even become conceited. Well. Here's how... we'll organize the work. In the morning, we'll flip a coin. Whoever wins... decides what we will do that day. He can talk about what he wants, ask the questions he wants, on the subjects he wants. Shall we start? Heads or tails? Heads. Heads, you won. Choose your subject. Adult problems. Answer without cheating! Adult problems. It's to cope with elements we didn't choose... ...and try to make something out of it that we really want. It's complicated but why impossible? For example, you want to make a cake. But you have only sand, sea water and wind. Well... I've already done it. - It wasn't a cake, but a castle. - My cakes are castles. - Now you play with words. - What does it mean "to play with words"? - To say a cake is a castle. - We have no right to say it? Yes. So one has the right to say that a castle is a cake? - Apparently, yes. - So there's no problem. Have you heard about Arthur Rimbaud? On the calm black wave where the stars cradle white and candid, Ophelia floats like a great lily Floats very slowly, lying in her long veils... Floats very slowly more than a thousand years that pale Ophelia passes, a white phantom, on the long black river; I also write poems... ...from the age of six. Good. You started very early. I'll show them to you one day, not now. - Why not now? - You wouldn't understand. Louise, Paula, Morgane, Julien, it's ready! - Serve Emilie! - Right away, sir. - It looks like everything is going well? - Yes, everything is fine. We did some mental gymnastics. Mental gymnastics, that's exactly what we need. You always wrote for the "Blue Review"? White, the "White Review". - But nothing has been published yet? - No, not for the moment. Perfect, then send no more article! Why? - Your mother and I are going to set up a magazine. - Really? Short articles, glossy, Spiritual pamphlets, admirably obscure poems... ...which will amaze the bourgeois, who will greedily throw themselves on the magazine every week. Illustrated by Medis. Who might that be? Hubert, what pleasure! - Do you know everyone? - No. Julien Barnes, Morgane's tutor. Count Hubert de Barente, my cousin. Albert, bring us refreshments! Do you remember the ocher room? Of course, the one with the view. Thank you Albert. - Do you want to see the top pieces, my dear? - No, no! The express to Paris leaves in 2 hours. Armand, can you come one moment? Well Hubert, what's going on? I can understand everything, you know. As it happens, my dear Emma, now you're not with me, but with Senator Dolbac. Bravo, this house has a secret and delicate soul. But when must we leave? Work will start Monday. Monday? We entertain on Tuesday. How to notify everyone? We won't deprive your cousin of her day, right? Let's say... Thursday. Again sorry for this little interruption. Ladies, gentlemen. Looking forward, my dear. Let's go! You'll take us to the station, Albert! Don't worry, I'll return him in a few hours. Well children, let's eat! Let us feast! You have to let me read your articles. You know how we're going to call this magazine? The Ocher Review. You feel sick? No it's okay. - Did you travel before? - No, never. My father was a teacher. Lack of money obliged him to have a job on the side until his death. - Which one? - Public writer. When his eyesight declined, he asked me to write the letters in his place. - Write what? - Mostly the administrative mail. On occasion, I've had to sort out some troubled minds, or try to give comfort to souls in distress. I must have instigated disasters. At the time I was very inexperienced. And are you experienced now? More, I don't know. And your mother? She died at my birth. Have you missed her? Certainly. Will you be a teacher later? I'll be a writer. What are we going to do? Don't you trust me anymore? Liliana, your daughter is radiant. I adore my future son-in-law. You still have your villa at Lake Geneva? I go there next week. Could we join you there? There is no longer a free room available. I booked two floors of the Grand Hotel. There's still a suite. Come for ten days! At my expense, of course. I shall never know why, mother, father, For exactly 13 years, That my heart beats, that my eyes see, But you do not remember it. I shall never know why, mother, father, You forgot the day of my birthday, But this error is atoned for. And I won't bear any grudges, mother, father. Embrace me! Did you want to speak with us? Well, I understand that you leave tomorrow, and I wanted to know, am I going with you? But of course! And... where do we go, if I may allow myself? You know well that it's not the destination which makes the appeal of the journey. Anything else? Yes, sir. My wages! Dear friend, could we try to behave as a man of the world? I acknowledge the importance of this quality... ...and... I realize the advantage it gives you. We have to take care of this, don't we Emma. I shall personally give this business all the care which it deserves. By the way, I read your articles. The one that sets the Symbolists against the Decadents is brilliant. Your talent will make you a man either hated or revered, but... rich. - Certainly. - Well? We're not working today? The wedding date is fixed: Cecilia will marry Mr. de Marande in the spring. This dope who spends his life in clubs looking for his sustenance on a green felt... Don't ruin everything! We shall get on very well. Oh, no, don't move! Don't move. You'll stay with us, you know very well. You are too attached to Morgane. Teach him beautiful and light things. Nice and light? - He is lucky. - Lucky? Having a mother like you. Morgane! Well Morgane, we're waiting for you. Morgane. - Morgane. - Ha! - You scared me. - But it's you who scared me! I sleep with my eyes open, some people are like that. In any case, hurry up! Hurry! Good! - Heads or tails? - Heads. Your turn! Problems of the child. OK. - You don't have any friends your age? - None. - You never had any? - Never. - Why? - Children don't like me. - Why so? - I don't know. - Doesn't it bother you? - I like to be alone. And now you are here. - I'm just passing through. - I know. - And what were you doing before my arrival? - Nothing, I waited. - What were you waiting for? - For you to arrive. - What are you waiting for now? - For you to leave. You should listen to me and escape. Hello! Mom discourages me to appear in public. Why shouldn't we look poor, if we are? Have you finished? I know they won't pay you. Who put that in your head? I get paid royally. How do you say in Greek "utterly predictable lie"? And how do you say "typical insolence?" - What do I need money for? - That's another matter. - In addition, they gave some advance fee. - A quite small advance fee. I'm not afraid of reality. I can very well do you justice. I haven't yet been able to find anything that might frighten you. Julien! You won't tell? - What are you reading? - The adventures of Captain Perquereau. "He embarked upon the "Fils de la Tempête" in Saint Malo... "...and went hunting tigers in India. "In the jungle he saw a magnificent tigress... "...at the edge of a river. "A crocodile wallowed in the water, mouth agape. "For play, the tigress slid her leg in there. "As soon as the crocodile closed its jaws... "...Corcoran fired and saved the tigress. "Eight days later, "he weighed anchor with her. Make a wish! This is the last one. Come on! Countess. This place is beautiful. Unfortunately, we must move out of the suite. Can we move in with Liliana? No, there's only family and close friends. I thought you were one of her oldest friends. It's true, I was Morgane's age when I met her. What do we do now? We extend the journey. Countess Gessinska is spending the holidays in St Petersburg. She'll lend us her palace in Krakow. Liliana organizes a masked ball tomorrow evening, will you come? - What should I wear? - I don't know. - A mere nothing dresses you. - Everything depends on the theme. Resurrect the splendor of the empire. Ah, that is Liliana's style alright. The highly-rated imperial dignity. - And later? - Rome, Vienna, Florence? Naples. I love Naples in the spring. I'll speak a word with the Countess. Countess, will you do me the honor? - How long have you been married? - 20 years, Countess. Russian marriages only last 7. 20 years of unabridged ownership? That's an unusual thing. You have the uttermost happiness of loving and being loved. Go now my friend, I'll watch you dance. - Are you packing your luggage? - No. I'm tidying up my things. What is it? - What's wrong? Are you okay? - It will pass. - Would you want to do the same as Zenobi? - Zenobi? She was my nanny in days gone by. It was her that made me aware. - Aware of what? Here, drink! - Of their methods. As soon as they realized that she liked me, they took her everywhere and stopped paying her. She remained as long as she could. Why would I be treated like this "Zenobi"? - Do you take me for an idiot? - No. I am ashamed. Julien! I'm leaving. But I'll inform Morgane of the reason for my departure. - You didn't do such a thing? - But for whom do you take me? A mother has ways to prevent people from deforming her in the eyes of her son. I would distort the truth if I accused you of being merely honest. My dear Julien, what need do you have of money, while we live so peacefully? - You are both unbelievable! - Really? How do you perceive us? Superficial, selfish, narcissistic! - You are adventurers. - Ho ho? Adventurers? You don't pay your debts. You live off society. You're liars. In addition you're despicable snobs. - The Ocher Review? - It turned red! Your outlook on life is only shrewd speculation, meanness. - You believe everything is due to you, right? - Yes. In addition you claim being respectable. That makes you even more squalid. It's true. We agree. Well, since we agree, let's go to bed! See the excellence of my nature. I bring you 50 francs. - 50 francs? - Look Julien, be reasonable. Aren't you paid for your efforts by the joy of living with us? In the absence of worry. The slightest of your needs being taken care off. Would you be willing to make a real sacrifice? My services up to now must be compensated. From today on they become free? Isn't it only a matter of conventions? For you, conventions have no importance. My husband asked me to hand you this new advance. I have no account with him. You don't want it? I shall be more free. To poison the mind of my little angel. You know, the mind of your little angel... I'm cold. Move closer to the stove. Are you hungry? Can you go and fetch him a packed lunch? Never mind, I'll go. Anyway, I need to stretch my legs. Thanks Julien. (he reads a book in English) Do you like muffins? We should start living together. Huh? We should start living together. - Living together? - Yes. You would find a job. You could write. I will help you. But your parents will never let you go. They worship you like a little god. They are so proud of you. Well, I'm not proud of them. I wish that those who bear my name would have a sense of honor. Who is he, the brown chap? Lord Dorrington, we met at the Dinsen Hoffers. I wonder if it really was the moment to organize all this fuss. (speaking English) I'm sorry. I will see you out. What's going on? They choose the wrong day. Oresky organized a ball tonight. Leave! I shall escape and join you. Not before having made you an accomplished person. So that my success will be credited to you? You think I'll probably die and that you will hold out till then. You really are too smart... ...to live. I find this idea very low and I shall punish you by clinging to life. Watch out, I could poison you. Have you noticed that since your arrival I did not see a single doctor? You're soaked darling, rush! Get warmed up! You are soaked as well. Take that off! Thank you, I... thank you very much. Can you lend me 60 francs? No, honestly, where do you expect me to find 60 francs? I need the money at all costs. Look how beautiful she is! Go ahead, don't be shy! - But no, she is going away. - Run! (foreign language) What did you tell her? That you are in love with her. She finds you a bit young but will meet you here in 10 years at the same time. December 24, 1907, 4:10. Come on! Your turn! Poetry. Poetry? It's familiar, but comes from afar. It's in us, but we do not know it. I know it's in me. You as well, it is in you. You are really lucky. I'm sorry, she lost a leg... ...that's why I was able to get hold of her. I got chased by the storekeeper. I stole his fir tree in front of his shop. It was that or a turkey. To run with a turkey in your arms has much less charm, right? Look, I've never seen anything more beautiful. Can I embrace you? One day it was so cold... ...that time stopped... ...and went the other way. The first surprises were for the hens... ...who saw their chicks go back into their shells. The yachts sailed against the wind, rivers went back their course. And the rain returned to the sky. Soon, everyone went out into the street. The people were astonished... ...because they began to rejuvenate. You couldn't notice this yet, nevertheless... ...white hair had regained its color. A look of radiance. But the most amazing thing took place on a battlefield. A dead man stood up and looked at the one who had killed him. He recognized his brother... ...he had not seen for ten years. They saw their parents again who had loved them so much. And love returned to earth... ...to the people. The earth began to warm up. Soon, it did so well... ...that time was able to resume its path. And we of the cafe's terrace. Julien! Julien! It's snowing. - Children, we go to the opera tonight. - Hush, be silent, he's sleeping! But that's perfect, he will be in great shape. Don Giovanni, a treat! I had a hard time getting these seats. You will love it. I'm telling you it's sold out! My dear Julien, when it comes to starting a business... ...it's the opera were we take the pulse of public opinion. Mozart will do you both a world of good. Oh, my God! Don't stay here my darling, go! Julia, go to bed! Go to bed! And you, stop whining! (In a foreign language) Preparation schools. Young man accepts all conditions. Be in Lyon quickly. Answer paid for. I hope this rich young man will be an idiot and retains you for a long time. The longer I stay, the bigger will be the pension for my old age. Suppose these people will also dare to not pay you. Oh no! - I can not fall 2 times in a row on... - The same gang of scoundrels. He is lucky, this rich young man. Not really, if he's an idiot. But how do you go back to France? I don't know, I'll go to the consulate. And I'll borrow some money on the credence of this telegram. Yes, show the telegram, take the money and stay! What will you do? I shall get on better with them as soon as you have left. Hearing you, it sounds like it is I who put you up against them. All this only happened by your presence. But I'll be fine. I will take care their business and marry my sister off. It's you who will marry. Remember. You have an appointment in ten years. After the visit of Countess Vizenska, accompanied with a slightly too prying inspector, my parents decided to pack their bags and settle down in Paris. I spend my time pacing the city from the "Invalides" to the "Notre Dame". When the weather is nice, I ferret about the docks. And when it is too cold, I go to the Louvre, to take advantage of the stoves. Two artillerymen start to launch bombs, at different times. One is 36 rounds ahead and shoots 8 rounds, while the other only shoots 7. The first one uses in 4 rounds... ...as much powder as the other in three. They have to stop... ...when they have spent the same amount... ...of powder. How many shots does it take before... ...the last... ...shot is taken? Mister Chambard, who started as a toiler, and became a tax inspector, has taken a real passion for the public service. Fabien, he dreams of a cassowary at St. Cyrien or a cocked hat at the Polytechnique. Poor man. Well! You don't look tremendously sick. Why didn't you write to reassure me? And you? Why didn't you answer my letter? What letter? Morgane was very sick when I wrote you. And you know perfectly well that in this case your place is with him. You had no right to abandon him. By turning your back on us, you are creating heavy responsibilities. I turned my back on you? Will you still claim that he's not sick? It will pass by, my angel. Now that Julien is back, ...everything is going to be like before. You will have your life, your work, your freedom. And we will never embark on another foolish adventure. This is too absurd. We'll pay for all the nonsense we made. And we'll have a good time. You, Dad, me... ...and Julien, of course. Did you think of ordering anything for Julien's supper? I go immediately. I booked a room for you, Julien. I have to be in Lyon in three days. Are you taking me? I have a plan. - A plan? - To escape. Do you remember Captain Corcoran? We're going to do like him. We'll go to St Malo. We'll start as a ship's apprentice and go to India. You are crazy. You want to offer me your life to show me your gratitude. And I have no desire to receive this gift. My dear Julien, lightning struck us. Everyone has to fend for himself. Accordingly, however cruel the need is to... ...separate us from Morgane, we must hand him over to you. You are so appropriate... for the biggest sacrifice made. We have complete confidence in Julien, Morgane. You mean that he can take me with him? Wherever he wants? Get out! Morgane! Morgane! Morgane! Morgane! Morgane! Morgane! Morgane! Are you weeping? Take me! Subtitles by Subransu, helped by VitaminSea translated from French subtitles by Didgilmar
