Raph! You realize what you just told me? Why are you getting mad? Can no one say anything without you flying off the handle? Because you decide how I should react, too? This is unbelievable! Why can't we have a discussion without screaming at each other? You know what, Félix? Fuck off! Raph! Don't take it that way! Are you kidding? I'm supposed to take it well, too? -It's not that, it's-- -What is it? I'll figure out the couch myself. The couch? I told you I found a couch for my new place. What? No, you never mentioned a couch! You just said you needed help for something off Craigslist. Well, it's a couch. -That two of us can carry? -Forget it. I'll figure it out. BEWARE OF THE ADORABLE DOG -I said fuck off. -This is ridiculous. I'm not letting you screw your back up. Oh! Here are the big strong men! Raphaël? So your best friend was able to come in the end, then. Alright. Right this way. Here is the beast. Well, that has nothing to do with the picture in the ad. It doesn't photograph well, but in real life, it's super comfortable. And I'm pretty sure I made my four children on it. Well, sweet. Alright. Want a quick coffee? No, shit, it's not going to fit! She dumped me like a piece of trash, I swear. -I didn't see it coming. -Oh yeah, got it. And the worst thing about all this? -She took the dog, too. -Horrible. -I can't see! -I'm carrying it all! -If this keeps going, I'm letting go. -No matter what, he'd always jump on me. Not her. He didn't like her. -It's going through! -He didn't like her. -Pick up the left! -Shut up! Hey, can we put it down? Oh, shit. -Switch? -Yeah. Alright. -Which way are we going after? -Straight. You been thinking about telling me this for long? About telling you what? That you no longer want us to be friends. I'm just wondering. Yeah. Well, basically, it's... I had a revelation thanks to this thing I learned at work. This guy developed a method that says we're defined by colors. That explain our personality. There. And I found out that I was blue. But like, you know, dark blue. Alright. And what's blue? Analytic. Rational. Someone who always wants to keep things legit. Transparent, you know. OK. And how about me? That is where it gets interesting. You're super yellow. And blue and yellow, basically, it... Like, it doesn't work. Remember that time we had a huge fight in Mexico? -Yeah. -Yeah? Well, that was a classic yellow and blue problem. It wasn't just because we got the wrong bus and you had -a whole meltdown because somebody... -Hang on. It was your fault we got the wrong bus and had to crash at that old lady's with the crazy dog and the bedbugs. It was awful. OK. It just goes to show you yellows often don't give a damn. The proof is in the couch. It's a piece of crap. It's ridden with tears. We waited around for an hour. I mean, it's no big deal, but for me, it just... It's a pain, you know, for blues. If I were green, at least, greens are more receptive. -They're chiller. -No, I'm sorry. You don't cut people out of your life -based on a color scheme. -You do cut people out of your life. You cut people out because that's life. You cut people out when it's stopped working. It's more honest. It's more real. Less hypocritical. -You have to be realistic. -That's true of couples! Well, why wouldn't you do the same with friends? It's not easy to do. But at least, it's clear. I don't want this thing to peter out, to slowly wither away. "This thing" being our friendship? Yes, but you know what I mean, Raph. We were great pals, but that was 20 years ago. We did some awesome stuff together. Middle school kid crap. It was great, but you do realize we don't have much in common anymore. What are we doing together these days? -Shall we? -You got something planned right now? -Yeah. -What is it? I have a choir rehearsal. -You have choir? -Yeah, I have choir. At 5 p.m., and I can't be late, so can we please hurry? Since when are you in a choir? It's been six months, something like that. Please. Mind you, I should've guessed. We haven't seen each other in ages. You've stopped texting me back. -You've got some nerve. Here I am-- -Except today to deal with the couch. Now I understand why better. Wait. Hang on. Last year, on my birthday, -had you already planned to dump me? -Well, I don't... Is that why you gave me a crappy gift? -I didn't give you a crappy gift! -You were in a huff all night. How could I have fun at your birthday? I don't know your friends these days. I have nothing to say to them. Hang on. What... Hang on. the guy who held my leg for hours by the grill? With the long hair. The ginger. You must be talking about Nathalie. Who found you very nice, actually. Hang on. Nathalie? No. -I was sure that-- -OK, who cares? What about Nathalie? No, there's nothing wrong with Nathalie. It's just... I skipped a tennis tournament to come see you and I barely saw you. I just spent the night eating a charred sausage, with... Nathalie telling me her life story, which I didn't give a fuck about. Going home, on the bus, I thought, "Never again." And you sent me a text, like, "Great night. So cool to see you!" So I thought to myself, I wondered if we met today in our current lives, would we become friends? Don't you know friendships require upkeep? Of course they take upkeep, but that takes time. For fuck's sake, quit it with the time! You have "time" to go to choir! You don't not have time, you just don't want to! If that's what you think, say it! As part of this great chivalrous process of telling the truth and not pretending. Am I the only one you've decided to burn bridges with? No. Well, yes, you're the only one I've... Made a song and dance about announcing it to? That's right. It's almost a nice show of friendship, then. You might say that, yes. Well, shall we get back to it? I imagine you're not coming tonight? Since you didn't answer Sophie's e-mail. -What's tonight? Who's Sophie? -Sophie Cloutier. The high school ten-year reunion. She sent loads of emails. I hadn't honestly planned to go, no. There will be loads of people. Everyone will be there. Who is everyone? Juliette, Flora, Robin, Philou. Like a "see you in ten years" type party? No, thanks. Honestly, that kind of thing really brings me down. Especially if it's to find out Robin has become a high ropes course instructor and Sophie Cloutier, a dog groomer. No, thank you. Come on. You know what I mean! I feel no need to see them again. It's not a matter of need. It's just fun. It's nice. I guess... Aren't you thirsty? Hang on. Stay there. I'm going to get something. Oh, come on, Marcel. Come quick. Let's go! I think you said something accurate earlier. You asked me, "Would we become friends "if we met today, in our current lives?" Yeah. I don't think we would. So, I accept this break-up, Félix. We can say goodbye as good friends, as they say. OK. So, I don't know when we'll see each other again. Maybe at Didier's to drink a disgusting coffee. -Did that wreck your stomach, too? -It was hell! That stuff is horrible! Come on. Let's go. -Careful. You have the... -What? -What? -Don't go so fast! -This way! It's this way. -"This way, this way", what? Come on! Come on! -Come on. We're almost there. -Wait. Now I'm thinking about it, why did you ask me what I was doing on June 12th the other day? Also, I didn't answer, sorry. No worries. I need people to help me move. I'm just kidding. I'm getting married. -What? -Alright. It's right here. Yeah, I'm getting married June 12th. -Who are you getting married to? -Sophie. Sophie Cloutier. What! I didn't even know you two were together! I've been suggesting we get a beer for six months, but you have choir. Also, she's not a dog groomer at all. She's an architect. She just opened an office. She's killing it. Wait, what? That's awesome! That's incredible! Congrats! -It's-- -Alright, don't overdo it. Wait, where are you getting married? Are you really interested? You won't be there anyway! You seem to feel like a dumbass. But blues must be quite good at handling that kind of feeling? No, not especially, no. Oh. Well, shucks. Well, thanks for your help, anyway. And for your honesty, too. Ultimately, maybe you're right. I don't know, Raph, honestly... Yes, honey. Yes, we're at the apartment. No, I'm not sure you'll like it. You know, I don't think we'll even bring it up. I'll leave it on the sidewalk and call bulky waste removal. Félix? Yes, he came. Oh yeah, no. He's really sorry for not answering your emails, but tonight, he really can't come. Got it. I'll tell him. See you later. She sends hugs. That's so nice. Give her a hug from me, too. Are you going to leave, then? Usually, when you dump someone, you leave after. To leave the other person alone, yeah? And who is your best man? -Félix! What's up? -Seb! I'm good, you? It's been ages, man! Well, yeah! -And that's the... -Don't worry. That's staying here. -OK. -Shall we? -We have to finish the other layer. -Yeah, you're right. Nice to see you again briefly, Félix. See you next time! Probably at the wedding, I guess? -Totally! -Alright, let's do it! Raph! Where is tonight's thing? GOOD FRIENDS
