Don't stretch your legs. You're a prisoner, behave like one. Give me a toothpaste. I think all of them are busy with the Langar. Go and check. They're here. - Are they? Okay, come on. Jai Hind, sir. - What's your name? Dalbir Singh. - Dalbir Singh. We've been honking for so long, didn't you hear that? Are you high on some drug, right in the morning? Bloody... Sir, we all were busy with the arrangements for Langar, so... I didn't hear it. We're here with a new inmate. Prepare food for him as well. Sure, sir. Make it fast, we need to go back as well. Okay, sir. Open the second gate. Good morning, Jailor. Good morning. I have a new inmate. Show me the papers. Show him the paper. Come on, hurry up. Hey, that sounds like gun shots. Get inside. You take a reverse. From the State prison, six inmates escaped this morning, in a Bollywood style. And our police could do nothing. So, what did you see? We heard gun shots. And then we saw four to five cars leaving from here. Monty Singh is a dangerous terrorist, who was caught in Delhi Airport in the year 2014. He leads a liberation movement. The ISI and other terrorist organisations are helping him. But since he got caught, all his movements stopped. Post the surgical strike, we were getting reports from the intelligence agency regularly, warning us of some major incident. Despite taking so many precautions, they fled from jail. This is a blot on our department. Special task force will coordinate with NIA and IB. And I want Monty Singh, within the next 24 hours. Without any excuses. Yeah, exactly! Don't forget to put road blocks in Kaithal. Stop the car. Deploy extra force specially over there. I want all exit and entry points... - Show me your ID. If you were so alert earlier, we wouldn't have to be here. - Kartar, let them do their duty. It's only been an hour since they fled, would not have gone far. Have a checkpost everywhere in the radius of 50 kms of Nabha. Anything out of the blue, call me. Kartar... Let's go. Hello. Abhinav Mathur, STF. Kartar and Shreeni. They're in my team. Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind. Senior inspector, Satnam Singh, Punjab Police. He is the assistant jailor of this jail, Bhim Singh. Sir. We were making a plan to track the criminals along with the jail staff. Satnam, prisoners have escaped from jail. They did the planning. You just investigate the case from ground zero level. Sorry, sir. Yes, Mr Bhim Singh. What exactly happened here? Tell me in detail. Tejinder, take all of them in these two cars. Once you reach Mastgarh, you'll get more cars. Okay, Babaji. Sir, all of them had latest weapons. We couldn't stop them. - Neither could you shoot them! What were the guards doing? Why didn't you counter-fire? Sir, we fired as much as we could. But as we were making arrangements for the Langar, we had kept our weapons out of reach. How many of our people are injured? A guard, Munshi and jailor, Birender were injured. We've got them admitted to Civil Hospital. Yes, minister. - You are aware of the escapees. What is the police doing till now? Sir, we have just arrived. - Go, find them! Yes. I'll report to you. Jai Hind. Did you identify any of them? - They were policemen, sir. Did you recognize any of the attackers? They are police, sir. I mean, criminals in the garb of of police. They had created such a chaos here, that we couldn't identify any of them, sir. Can I get the details of the prisoners who fled? Yes, sir. - Get it. They were six of them. Navtej Singh, Bald... - I'll check the list. Yes, Shreeni. - Sir, I've checked everything. The different positions of cameras and also the CCTV room. Sir, when I frisked the entire jail, I found sim cards and currency notes of Rs 1000. From cell number 7. - Must be from across the border. Cell number 7. Who was in it? Monty? Yes, sir. Monty Babaji. Monty Babaji?! Mr Bhim Singh, your saint staying out of jail, is a threat to the entire nation, not just to Punjab. Got it? Sir. Sir, have a seat. Sir, out of four working cameras, the footage of three cameras are of no use. Because the position of the cameras were changed. You can see sky on one, and birds on the others. Sir, the location was perfect in the morning. Then I was called for the Langar preparations. I wonder how the position was changed. Sir, there is one camera in the main area. Should I cue that and show you the footage? Shreeni, do one thing. Check the footage just five minutes before the Fortuner enters. - Sir. Shreeni, isn't that Mr Bhim Singh? Correct, sir. Bhim Singh, what were you doing? Sir, we were preparing for Lang... - The Langar? Yes. Who are you talking to? He is Kamaljit Singh. The one who escaped this morning? Where was Monty during the shootout? Sir, he was at Munshi's shop. The one who got injured today. You were right, sir. The currency is all fake. And those mobile sims are blocked. Good job. It's been more than two hours since they fled from here. And we have no information from any of our check-posts. I am sure, they're stalled at some place. Or they've already crossed the check-posts somehow very cleverly. They must have changed their cars. Satnam, listen to me. Haryana, UP, Punjab... Alert their exit points. Ask them to observe the faces carefully, and not cars. Okay, sir. Sir, there's a confusion. How can pigeons fly along with crows? How? In order to get out of a cage, every bird flutters. It's just about an opportunity. Let them fly as much as they want. They have to land back on the ground, in times of need. Put all the phones in this area on surveillance. Find out which mobile phones in jail received a phone call, and out of those, which one is not here right now. Let's start, Operation Parindey! Now, all of you need to switch off your phones. They would either be tracking them or trying to tap them. Yes. God be with you. Everything is fine over here. I have already started. I haven't done anything big, since a very long time. I need your support for that. If we get together, we can easily fulfil our wish, very soon. Yes. God be with you. Hey! Stop here. Look over there, there's a check-post. Bloody... Which route are you planning to take ahead? Was thinking of heading to Siwan, and then via Kaithal Bypass, we'll cross Haryana border. No. Police will block the road even at Kaithal. You better go via Kheri Ghulam Ali towards Titram. I'll show the way. Take a left now. So, tell me something. What happened today morning? Sir, we usually organize Langar in the jail on Sundays. Today morning, the arrangements were going on. Sir, on days of Langar, we set a few inmates free. For help. But when I saw Monty outside his solitary confinement, I was shocked. Then, those cars came. And you know what happened after that. Mr Munshi, I believe, that without the help of an insider, no outsider could have executed such a big task. What do you think? Yesterday evening, I was walking towards my store. 'Let them fly, who want to fly.' 'You will get what has been promised. Focus on your work.' I told Bhim Singh about such a serious issue. But he didn't pay attention to me and ignored it as a joke. You are a blot on the department, you mother f*****r. This is what sir wants to say. Now, you tell me what do you know about this jail break? Who was Monty talking to, last evening? Sir, there's a misunderstanding. Kartar... Monty Singh should have been sitting where you are right now. You're definitely hiding something from us. Sir, I swear. I don't know anything. Look... Look at this. 3 million views. 'Help! Let me go.' - Hmm... Have a look. - 'Let me go.' Six months ago, this was shot in Jalandhar jail. 'Help!' People are banged in jail. Just imagine an inmate from your jail, screwing you. And that video goes viral. Forget about releasing a prisoner from jail, you wouldn't want to step out of the jail. Come on, get up. Shreeni, get that giant Dilawar from cell number 15. Let him screw him. Speak up! - I don't know! Mother f****r, speak up! Speak up, I say! - Sir, please let me go. Come on, speak up! - Sir... Sir, sir, sir... I'll tell you. - Speak! Come on. Sir, this morning, Monty Singh should have been in solitary confinement. But I let him come out for a while. He made an excuse of buying some things. Sir... I didn't know, he'd flee! He told you and you let him go! Was he a good friend of yours? I could never say no to Him. Him? Sir, I was highly inspired by him. How is that? 'Monty was brought out of his solitary cell for two hours, every evening.' 'And he used to give sermons to the inmates, during that time.' 'I tried to stop him a couple of times.' 'Come on, Babaji. It's time to get back to your cell.' 'All of you, go back too.' 'You go back... - Bhim, what are you doing?' 'Don't you know Babaji?' 'It is not your jail, ' 'but his sermons that's improving these inmates.' 'Sir will show us all the right path.' 'He'll free us from this abyss.' 'Kamal...' 'To each his own.' 'In this world, everyone has to' 'fulfil his duties and responsbilities.' 'So is Bhim.' 'Bhim, all of us are captives.' 'Of God.' 'Will this jail, its walls, ' 'be able to stop anyone from attaining salvation?' 'His devotion.' 'Babaji's words started influencing me.' 'Kamaljit and Randeep were' 'already his devotees.' 'But I noticed that Babaji' 'spent more time with Pabbi.' You mean, Prabhjyot? Isn't he the one who was sentenced to life imprisonment? For having murdered a policeman? - Yes, sir. Sir, one month before the harvest festival this year, Pabbi suffered a heart attack. He was taken to the Civil hospital. And then, he fled from there. Babaji, why can't I tag along with you? Kamal... I told you, we'll talk about this later. Shreeni, there's a hunch... It's just a theory. Just go with me. Play the footage from where the main attacker came out of the Fortuner. Sir... There you go. There, there, there... There... Pause. Stop! Bhim Singh... Look at these two images very carefully. Oh, no! He is Pabbi. Abhinav, what is the progress? - They fled in just 12 minutes, sir. This isn't a day's planning. It's a conspiracy. They had planned it in great detail. And as per the basic inquiry so far, it looks like as if the criminals came here to get their accomplices released. And the terrorist fled with them. Or it could be vice versa. Don't worry, sir. No matter how high they fly, I'll get them. Bloody... Are there potholes on the road or the other way round? We should have reached Delhi by now. Pabbi, control your anger. We'll head to different locations, from here. You and Rana go towards UP. Once you go ahead, you guys should also split up. And you? Where will you head to, Babaji? You will get what you've been promised. Once you reach Dehradun. Got it? 40 millions! Keep your phones off. It's been three hours since the prisoners fled. It's my gut feeling. They would've parted. Crows and the pigeons, went their own ways. Sir! A coded email from Delhi is intercepted. After decoding, it reads, 'Season of sequels in 24 hours.' 'URI Attack 2!' Kartar, Shreeni, this isn't what it looks like. Breaking News. Through secret resources, we have information that Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi and Mumbai, are put on high alert. That's right. It is suspected that terrorists are up to the execution of some big conspiracy. Sir, the origin of this coded message is Islamabad. And the jail break is a diversion. The plan is something bigger. - You could be right. But after URI, our neighbours won't share any plan with anyone. Anyway, I'll personally follow up on this. You focus on Monty. Sure, sir. Hello, Babaji. - God bless, Rupy. What are you doing, Babaji? Your location is being tracked. Despite being here in Hong Kong, I can see that you're in Haryana. Your phone is off, but as long as the phone has battery in it, your phone will be tracked. - I know what I am doing, Rupy. Sorry, Babaji. - It's an excellent plan, Rupy. For the next three, four days, police will be busy chasing the gangsters. All arrangements are done. You will get the money and further instruction in Delhi. That's good, Rupy. I'll hang up now. Sir... I've got the details of cell surveillance. Since last night, more than 1500 calls were made. From the tower near State jail. I've put all the numbers on tracking. Out of those, two numbers were together even a while back. Have a look, sir. Look at this number, sir. 9990. This was with someone in the jail, all night. Whole night active. And this one, 3725... It was active till the jail break this morning. In this same area. Both these numbers were together till Titram, near Kaithal. And from there, they were separated. One went towards Kairana and the other, towards east side of Pundri. Were you able to tap any of these numbers? No, sir. Since morning, both the phones are switched off. 3725. Could be Pabbi's number. Isn't that going towards Kairana? - Yes, sir. Shamli District. Shreeni, good job! Hello, Komal... I didn't understand one thing. How did Babaji come out? We had discussed only about the other three. Who would not want to escape, if given an opportunity? He got a chance to escape, so Babaji also fled. Okay, you leave. See you at Dehradun. - Dehradun, and then Nepal. And then, we'll start a new life. Okay? See you. What are you doing? It's Google map. Let me at least see where we are. Jai Hind. How is the food? It's good. Hey, why did you order chicken? That doesn't taste good. Lakhan, listen. Get two Mutton Masala. For me and him. Try it. You'll remember it forever. Komal Bharadwaj. SP, Kairana. And you? Bhushan Singh. - From? What? - You are a cop from which area? Hey, make it fast. Well... Sangrur, Punjab police. Few prisoners fled from the State prison, this morning. Six of them. You must be knowing. Are you on the same case? I just got information that the leader of that attack, is somewhere near Kairana. I am looking for him. I just got his description, through the wireless. Height, around 6 feet. Fair complexion. He is sporting a police uniform. One major mistake. He had kept his phone on. Mother f****r, does it take so long to serve mutton? Pabbi's time is up. I'm sorry. You bitch! Abhinav, we got Pabbi. Yeah. Good job, Komal. Well done. Any casualties among our people? - No, sir. What did you find in Pabbi's car? - He had a lot of stuff. AK 47, two pistols and... This cell phone. This is the phone we were tracking. Also, the number that was moving towards Rajasthan, we found that in a truck. Monty is misguiding us. - Clearly. What's the status of Pabbi? - We've beaten him to pulp. But his lips are sealed. Never mind, Kartar will take care. Komal, do me a favour. Please give the things you've found from Pabbi's car to Shreeni. Sure. - I'll just... Sir, he has been whacked enough. He won't speak a word. I swear on my mother, sir. I know nothing. Look... Look at this, you mother f****r! This is the video of the same jail you fled from, 11 hours ago. Look how's he getting screwed. Did you recognize him? Why are you showing this to me? I really don't know anything. Neither could Bhim Singh recall anything in the morning. We asked him, thrashed him. And then, he recalled everything. See it for yourself. Maybe, you'll recall everything too. Sir, I was... I was only driving the car. Sir, please spare me. I don't know anything. I... Sir, I'll hold his hands. He'll worm the truth out, when he'll be screwed. No! What are you up to? Leave. I'll tell you. I was sentenced to life imprisonment. And was sent to the State jail. 'You dog! Bloody f*****s Let me go! I say, let me go! A year later... Who is this restless soul? He is quiet, yet restless. He is my friend, Pabbi. Extortion, murder, drugs... We were partners in crime. He was the king of Underworld before. There is no work on earth that Pabbi cannot do. Only condition being, he should earn good money. He hates policemen. He even killed a SI, Babaji. That is why, he is in jail. But... My friend loves to wear the police uniform. Meet him, he is Babaji. Our saviour. How long will you remain a captive? Of your own thoughts. The day you decide to sacrifice yourself for your loved ones, that day, no one will be able to stop you. Break free of these shackles. Set yourself free. - Gradually, I felt that Babaji was right. Pabbi, if we have to die, why not die while doing the right thing? Die for your people. Rather than dying here, go out and start life afresh. Try to understand, Pabbi. Sir, Rana was a very good friend of mine. And it was very clear, he had become an ardent follower of Babaji. That's because, Kamaljit and Rana, were sailing on the same boat. I was convinced when Rana explained to me repeatedly. When I ate the tablet given by Babaji the next day, everybody thought, I had a heart attack. I created a havoc. And then I was taken to the Nabha Civil hospital. I was in my ward when I suddenly heard gun shots. Four armed men came in and took me away from there under everyone's nose. Yes, Rupy. Yes, everything went well. Yes, he is here. Hello, Mr Pabbi. I am Tejinder. I've heard a lot about you, from Babaji. I stayed at the bungalow for a few months. Food, drinks, enjoyment, everything was taken care of. We were not allowed to go out. Then one fine day, Tejinder came with two other men. From the State jail, we have to set Navtej, Ravinder and Baljeet. As of now, keep this with you. It's 10 million. Shall I ask you something? - Yes. Are we doing this for Monty Babaji? Mister, not only us. He has many followers all over the world. He is a saint. Harry? We have to execute a big task. Sir, I had already started the preparations from my end. The selection of cars, guns and few other men. I went to Nabha with my men, one day. I saw the neighbouring areas and the exit routes. And then I sipped tea right in front of the State jail. Sunday is a good day, Langar is organized. Everyone will be busy doing their work on that day. You will not find a guard with his gun, preparing for Langar. The day is finalized, but not the date yet. We will come to know the date a little later. According to the Prime Minister's decision, the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees will no longer be valid. There is a long queue outside the banks. It's already been two weeks since the demonitization.. And you are handing me the 100 rupee notes? What can I do in that case? No one in the country knew that such a thing would happen. And I have already paid an advance to you. No work will be done, until you pay me. I will execute the work once you give me the money. First the money and only then the work. Please calm down. Mister, there's a grave problem here. We are unable to do anything due to the demonetization. See to it that the currencies are not deposited into bank. Alright. Those are all fake notes. - Yes, you... Brother, myself Pabbi. I won't be able to do the job in this way. Tell me what next? Oh brother, the consigment is lying in the trucks in Islamabad. You just continue to do your job. You will be paid in dollars. You will be paid double the rate. Just finish off the work soon. Assume that your countdown has started. I have spoken to Monty Babaji. Rotten hell! I don't know who I am talking to! I want to have a word with Babaji. Greetings, Babaji. - Son. Keep doing your duty. To serve is your first and foremost duty. Let them fly, who want to. You will get what you have been promised. Concentrate on your work. I agreed to what Babaji told me. I asked him when we should execute the job. He said... 'Tomorrow, 8:00 AM.' 'Tejinder...' 'we're disguised as cops and you, as an inmate.' 'Okay?' 'Bloody... Don't stretch your legs, you're a prisoner, behave like one.' Babaji's planning was great. Before we could reach the jail next morning, Kamaljit had shifted the positions of all the CCTV cameras. 40 million was a big amount for us. To set them free. Rana was a friend of mine, so I helped him escape. But... None of us knew that Monty Babaji and Kamaljit were also planning to flee. This wasn't a part of the plan. There's a plan to attack the country under URI -2 What do you know about it? What? What are you saying, sir? I don't know anything about it. Sir... After he fled, I think Babaji spoke to someone in Pakistan. Using a satellite phone. He mentioned about some planning. I thought they were talking about escaping from the jail. A Saint and his disciple! Where did he go? Sir, all of us parted ways, after we reached Titram. I don't know what happened later. Fake uniform. Fake money. Fake knowledge and so was your courage, Fake! Sir, Monty has a satellite phone. I went through Monty's file. Initially, he started off with small attacks in Punjab. Kidnapping foreign diplomats, attack on Sara Sacha Sauda. Army killings, bomb blast, misleading the youth. Training them to accomplish his missions. And then Bangalore, 2014 bomb blast. No activities post that. Komal, what do you think? Where will Monty Singh go? He was nabbed at the Delhi Airport after the Bangalore blast. So he wouldn't take the same route. I think he will go to Mumbai. - I think, Nepal. Why? I think the ISI guys will help him out there. He won't go to the border. The BSF are on high alert there. Do you guys still think, this is a case of jail break? Think, why did he escape now? Out of the blue? - Sir... I don't understand. A lot of people have helped Monty in escaping. And I am sure he will go abroad and will plan something big. He will plan a big attack in India. And to do all this, he'll hide in a place from where he can make preparations. And the first thing he will do is, he will change his looks. Shreeni, sketch a couple of Monty Singh's looks and circulate it. Sir, well...? Just work on all the possible looks and send it to Delhi. Why, Delhi? Pabbi told us that Monty's last known location was Titram. Titram is in Haryana. And the biggest city closest to Titram is, Delhi. I have reached. I am closer to my destination. Now, tell me. About the status of Pakistan's preparations and the weapons. I'm sure something went wrong in my absence. Babaji, we are your soldiers. We can fight a battle, but not a war. You will have to come here for that. Look, you will get a train from Nizammudin railway station at 10.05AM. You will reach Panvel the next day at 8:00AM. You will have to travel in a general compartment for safety reasons. From there, you will go directly to Goa by road. And you will be flying by British Airways in the name of Joginder Singh. Once you reach London, everything you planned to do in India will be executed, Babaji. I will see you at Heathrow airport, Babaji. Shreeni, what about the sketches of Monty Singh? Yes, sir. - Show me. Sir, we have got a message from Jalandhar via wireless monitor. The last location of Monty Singh's satellite phone has been updated. An activity of making a call to Hong Kong has been tracked again. You MotherF****r That is what sir wants to say! Will you tell us about Monty's location now? It's Delhi, Delhi... But sir, we're unable to find his exact location. We have tracked Monty Singh's location. Somewhere in Delhi. I am sending you his sketches in various looks. Share it with everyone. - Okay, sir. I am sure, he must have changed his look by now. Jai Hind, Mr Abhinav. - Jai Hind. We have deployed police force everywhere. Airports, railway stations and bus stops. Good job, Kundra. Jai Hind. Sir, bombs have been found at multiple locations in Delhi. At the Terminal 3 of IGI airport, a suspicious bag has been found. The security has been increased. The coded message of URI - 2 attack was not a diversion, the State jail break is. We have been following that up since morning and the bombs were planted in Delhi! Did you think, how all of a sudden, we are finding bombs in Delhi? Especially, when Monty Singh has escaped from Punjab. I am sure he is behind all this. I had already mentioned it earlier, if Monty Singh has to do something big, he needs to get out of India. And for that, there's no better place than Delhi. After the reports from secret agencies, the Delhi NCR police is on a high alert due to the terrorist attacks. Mark all the locations on the map and show it to me. Yes, sir. Let me see it. - Here. Shivaji Park bus stand... Choudhary Charan Singh Road... Petrol pump... Jail Road flyover, Royal aquarium, Shadra, ISBT, Punjabi Park... There's a pattern in this. Why are all the bombs planted in east, west and north Delhi? South Delhi and south east Delhi is vacant. He's trying to divert our attention to these parts. So that he can get a safe passage, when South Delhi is vacant. You're right, sir. South Delhi has two major exit points. Okhla and Nizamuddin Railway Station. Kundra, Monty Singh can either escape from Nizammudin station or Okhla. You handle Okhla. I will take care of Nizamuddin with my team. Did you see someone like Monty? No, sir. I am going towards the entrance. Okay, sir. Spotted Monty! Checks jacket, blue turban. He must be around 25 feet away. Surround him. Sir, ticket counter! Ticket counter! Coming to you. Copy sir. Just spotted Monty! He's using the foot over bridge to go to the other side. I am going after him! Kartar! Kartar, Shreeni, no one shoots. I want Monty alive. Kartar, third track! No killing! Yes, sir. You've run enough, Babaji. Shall we go back? Never mind, mister. This time, it was Pabbi. Next time, it will be someone else. I'll find many more like Pabbi, in this country. Who will stop me? And to nab every Pabbi or Monty Singh, there will be many more officers like Abhinav Mathur in this country. Take him away. Sir! Got him! We are taking him back. Jai Hind, sir.
