Hey, Bindu. Have you seen my pants? No. I'm just... Go. Sorry. You'll break my heart staring at your food like that. Amma? Are you sure it's in this closet? There are some in that closet, and then some in the garage closet. Amma. - Found it. - Good! Amma... Bindu, why don't you tell me what it's really about? What do we have here? Girls talk? Should I leave? - Yes. - No. She doesn't want to go to school, and won't tell me why. Oh, it's still a... It'll get better. Bill and I both decided that it's important for you to go on. It's good for you. English, please. Thank you. Is it about the boys? What boys? I mean, nothing, nothing. She was getting teased by some boys, and I told her sometimes boys tease girls that they like. Like, one time I stole this girl's shoes, and she had to walk home with no shoes. I felt terrible about it. No boys. She knows better. Studying, right? No boys, no dating. Well, I... I didn't say anything about dating. - This is not a joke. - Okay. I don't want my girl running around wearing makeup and taking selfies. Or peeing in cups, I don't know. Sorry. Okay, no boys. No selfies. No dating, no tickling. No kissing. No dancing. No squeezing. - Oh. Oh, Phone! - Oh, God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go to school, Bill. - Take my phone. - Okay. Sorry. Oh, God. Oh! I'm getting the car detailed today. You didn't leave, like, your lunchbox back there or anything, did you? I don't know what it is. No. No. Definitely not. We'll figure it out, though. We'll get to the bottom of it. Buckle up, kiddo. Oh, gosh. So what are your plans for today? Doing anything cool after school? Maybe with your new friends? Whoa. Take it easy. No breaking hearts. Remember? Can we please not talk? - Hey! Cool glasses! - Hi. Thanks. All right, you girls ready to go to school? Buckle up. - It stinks in here. - Yeah, sorry about that. Kind of smells like gym class. - Whoa. - What? What? I thought I'd try something different. What's wrong? Help me. Smirthi. You girls want me to put on some hip-hop? We're fine. - How much did you put on? - I don't know. I couldn't see. Make you look like a clown. - Oh, my God. - This is for down there. What? No. It said moisturizer. It is... for sex. Have fun! Learn lots of... things. I can't believe I almost put that on my face. Where'd you even get that stuff from? What? That's major. You think they're having sex? Wow! You think my parents are having sex. Ugh. Gross. You're so lucky to have an American dad. You're legit now. He's not my dad. Good morning, Broad River High. Have yourself a Broad River Thursday. Don't miss the pep rally this afternoon out on the field. There will be s'mores for everyone. Oh, my God. What is this? Just paying you back for last night, whore. Boo. Hey, hey, Bindu, wait up. Oh! Please tell me you have my English homework. - Yes, I do, I do. - Would you slow down? - Can I have it? - Yeah. - Hurry up. - I'm trying. Here. Awesome. And to keep my part of the deal, I will show you how to get free copies from the library copier. Okay, cool. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Shouldn't have snuck up on you. It's all right. You all right? I don't know. - What's all over your clothes? - Huh? - Your clothes. - Uh... Why is this paper wet? It's shaving cream. They put shaving cream in her locker. They also wrote stuff on it. Wait, wrote what? I don't know. Whore... dick or dyke. I don't know, I didn't really look. Isn't that how they started with Jimmy Moore? No, it's not. Bindu, do you have a change of clothes? No. Oh, my gosh. Our first period is starting. I'm sorry, guys, I have to go. Wait. I bring you the finest Lost and Found has to offer. That's probably from the '90s. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. There she is. This is all my step-dad's fault. Did he put shaving cream in your locker? No, but my mom was homeschooling me until she met him, and then he was all like, "Let's give Bindu the All-American high school experience." And here I am. I'm sure this isn't exactly what he had in mind. You know Mr. Deedham's can of Spam award I won? - Yeah. - Well, it broke in my backpack, and I hid it in my step-dad's car. He still can't figure out what the smell is. What if we channeled some of this step-dad anger more constructively and told Sam Trenton to fuck off? Um, wow! No, thank you. It would feel really good to let it out. You should think about it. I gotta go expand my mind. - Bindu. - Hmm? My mind... It... It's expanding. - Stop! - Help! - No, no! - Call the police! Learning enthusiasts... let's be quiet. Focus. Read chapter seven. Why don't you go save some money for your... for your castration surgery? What is that? Sam. Trenton? Um, Bindu! Bindu! Got a moment? I... I wanna know how things are going in class. Oh, do you mean the material? Oh, no, you're... you're a very smart girl. Kind of remind me of myself. I, uh... I, too, was amongst the nerds. Oh. Great. Is there stress from your fellow comrades? Other classes? I... I don't know. It just, uh... It seems like people just don't like me. That's... That's just part of the high school experience. You have to... You have to find your tribe, your posse, your band of merry-makers. I didn't catch that. Nothing. May I leave? Um, I... That went well. Good job. Hey. How'd it go? Well, I told Sam and Trenton to get castration surgeries. Holy Jesus! No, no, no, no, no. - This is terrible. - No, it's amazing is what it is. Bindu, I didn't know you had it in you. Why would you even say that? I mean, were they speechless or what? I think she needs to know about Jimmy Moore. No, she doesn't. Who is Jimmy Moore? - Uh, Jimmy Moore is a friend of Peter's. - Rob? - No, he switched schools, right? - Rob? Oh, not before he was tied to his front porch and the spray-painted "fag" and "snitch" all over his garage. Fag? Uh, a pillow-biter? Homo? Homosexual. Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Was he a gay? Yeah. Yeah, that boy could walk into a room and set the drapes on fire with how flaming he was. Dude. I mean, why didn't he just try to blend in? Right! Exactly. So the lesson of the day is... don't mess with Sam and Trenton. Instead... Um... Check my work? Yep. You... You haven't done any of it. Oh, well, maybe I could, um... look off your homework, then? Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I will give this back to you in class, I promise. - I'll see you later. - Later. You know, I don't care what Rob says. Saying they needed castration surgery, that's badass. Bet it felt pretty good to say. Not as good as this will feel. What's that? It's the only way to end all this. Thank you for calling Broad River High. Mr. Julias, yes. Let me just check his schedule. - How many classes do you have to test out? - Just one. Whoa. I knew you were smart. That makes you, like, crazy smart. - Which one? Hmm. - Spanish. I'm super impressed. Ah, well, it was more fun than learning English, so... Hey, new kid! Gah! Hi! Hi! How do you know Trish Peterson? Oh, she's always lurking in the library, watching me and David C. sucking face. - Creepy. - Yes. Tomorrow at two. Have a Broad River day. Let me see what we have here. All right. All right. The Spanish proctor will be in the attendance room in seventh period today. Nice. Did you hear that? - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Hey! If it isn't my favorite new student Bindu! And, uh, her friend! So did you finally come in here to sign up for Acadaca? - Uh, no. - No? Mathletes. Oh my God! Can you imagine her on the team? We'll finally be able to kick Cathedral High's bootay! No, actually, I'm testing out of school. What? What are you talking about? It's only been a couple weeks. It's been too many. Come on, you're gonna miss the winter formal. Wonderful theme this year. And I'm sure your friend would be greatly disappointed. As Bindu's friend and a student who's been here for three years, Peter, I feel like her mind is pretty made up. Okay, so what you're telling me, Paul, is she's gonna take some take some time to think about it. Good. Smart. You. Me? You know I'd be good at mathletes. - Well, I still need the fee. - Uh, a fee? The proctor test has a fee. Fifty-seven dollars. We take cash or checks. Um... I don't have it. Well, then you'll have to take the next exam. When is that? March. March? Can you call your mom? Maybe. May I use your phone, please? - You don't have a phone? - No. One second. Excuse me. I need the money soon. Amma? No, it's me, kiddo. Why do you have Mom's phone? Because someone spilled juice on mine, remember? Um, I need you to bring me $55.75. Why? Um, it's, uh... It's for the, um, the dance. - The dance? - Yeah, um, winter formal. Did a boy ask you to the dance, kiddo? Yes... Oh... - Was it the boy that teased you? - Yes. - Yes, Bill. Exactly. - I knew it. Boys always tease girls they like. I once tackled a girl I liked, then I got suspended. It was sad. But you know what? I'm gonna have to talk to your mom about this, 'cause she's got some really silly thoughts about this stuff. I need the money by seventh period. I'm at a job now, hon. I can't leave. What if we get the ticket Monday? No, the tickets are running out. What if he buys the ticket and we pay him back? I... I didn't get that. Hello? Oh, you're screwed. - No. No, uh... - So... Well, yeah, I gotta agree with Trish here. It doesn't look great. Uh, well, here's what I got. Well, yeah, Bindu... five class periods, that's like ten dollars raised a period. So, what do you plan to do? Is she going to bring the fee? Yep. She'll be here by seventh period. - Go ahead steal it. - We're not gonna steal it. - What? - Okay. - Shouldn't you all be in class? - Yes. Madame, we've been waiting for you... to make your grand entrance. Please. Sit down. Now. I wanna smell brains burning. Do you have the notes from the rational functions? Uh-huh. - Rational functions notes. - What about them? I wanna see your notes. I should tell you that after today I really won't be able to give you any homework or notes or anything at all. But I thought we had a deal. Yes, but I just... I don't have time. Sam Abernathy! Maybe if you weren't on your phone all the time, you wouldn't be failing my class. Put it away. Right now. Did Pete put you up to this? I just... You know, maybe you should start to do your work, you know, yourself. I have four AP classes right now. You're killing me. Do you know what happens if my GPA drops below 3.9? I become a homeless person and I die. I don't think that's likely. It is. According to my Pops. Wouldn't yours do the same? My father's dead. Okay. - How much? - For what? How much is it gonna cost me for you to do my homework tonight? How about $53.75? What? No way. Okay. Five dollars. Oh, my God! What an idiot! - You just ate shit! - Are you kidding me? What was she doing? Looks like it hurt. She literally ran straight into the ball. How friggin' stupid can she be? Take the bench, Hindu. It's Bindu. Hindu is a religion. I can tell you're faking it. See that girl over there? The one who nearly knocked you out with the basketball? The redhead? She once gave a 40-year-old a blowjob outside Gary's Mart. A... A what? - Blowjob? - And he didn't even ask for it. That was nice of her in that case. That girl there? Puts vodka in her tampon, she's drunk all day. I have to get... I have to get this done by... This is as important as homework. These secrets I collect pay off. You can thank me later. So what's up with the cutie Peter? You guys a thing or what? - A thing of what? - You know, a couple. Oh! Oh. Just friends. Well, I heard from Nicole that Peter Wexler... she said his full name, so it had to have been him... broke the church window, tried to kill a priest. - What? - Yeah. Why isn't he in jail? 'Cause the priest forgave him. I do love me a bad boy. - You know, something, don't you? - No. You got a scoop, you come to me, all right? Nicole over there is a slut. And I pay. See you later, Bindu. See... I have something. It's big. Really big. I have something, and it's big. Dyke! Okay. I have something. I have something. I have something. I have to tell you right now. Scram! - Come with me. - Okay. Okay. Dish. Um, I need 20 dollars. - No way. Are you crazy? - No! I mean, uh, I need it for protection. - From? - Um... The Satanic cult. I knew it. Ten. Okay, so what happened? Did Peter kill the priest? Kill? Wow! Oh, no, I didn't say anything about killing. I'm not playing around here. No, I mean... This is something else. - So, it's about... - Peter. Peter, yes. It's about him. - He... - Secretly dated Mrs. Simon. - What? No. - No, I can disseminate that for weeks, and I can be a rebound side piece. Spit it out. Oh, um, he... Peed in the principal's Gatorade. No. Yuck. Okay, so what happened? He, uh... Uh... He ate a frog. That's not what I was expecting. Like, a whole live frog? Um... Yeah. Ugh. Huh. Whatever. I might just wait to break up with him after winter formal. I mean, I already got my dress, so... Oh my God, Kenzie's gonna break up with Sam. I don't know. He's almost, like, worth doing till college. Hell, no. That's a lollipop I won't lick. - She's talking about blowjobs. - Oh. Shocking. What is that? One for one, bitch. Hey! I told the lady at the attendance office that I don't have any lunch today, because my mother couldn't pack my lunch today, because she ran off with the clerk from Gary's Mart, and Dad's too heartbroken to make anything but cheese sandwiches... so she gave me this. Thank you. How'd you do? Well, I lost ten dollars learning about blowjobs. And now that I think about it, it's really quite an odd description, because there's no blowing at all. - Quarters. - Hmm? - Quarters. - What? I'm gonna get them to throw quarters at me. Wait. What? You know Lydia, right? The soccer team? - So you know Celia Johnson? - Yeah. Dude, I was at her house last night. - She pounded, like, an entire eighth of Jager. - Hey! You got a problem, curry-muncher? I mean, you can't really munch curry, but... Whatever. Get out of the way. It's a free country. - Just leave it. - Look, I'm... - I'm not in the mood. Just... - There you are. Fuckin' weirdos, man. What the hell was that? They were about to throw quarters at me, and you ruined it! Bindu, that's the saddest, most masochistic thing I've ever seen. If you're really that desperate, come on. I've got an idea. Did your mom really leave your dad for a clerk at Gary's Mart? No. They've been together a million years. Why did they write those words on your locker? "Whore" and "dyke"? - Yeah. - I don't know. - Thirty-five cents. - Nice. So they just randomly put that stuff on your locker? Okay, the only thing that I can think of is... You know the computer room on the second floor? Yeah, the one with the 1996 iMacs that no one ever goes in except to hook up. Yeah. Wait, what? Seriously? I wish someone would have told me that. I needed to print a report. They even call it the Steve Blowjobs room. What the fuck! Really? Again? No, no, no, no. Shh! I'll put... Um... I'll just, uh... I'll just go print in the library. You cockblocked Sam! Ha-ha! I suppose. Look. I don't... Peter, I don't want to be another Jimmy Moore or anything. That's not gonna happen to you. Isn't it already happening? Also... I may have told Holly something about you. - What did you tell her? - She just... She just talks so fast, and I got really flustered, and she wanted to know who you were dating, - and so I... - So what did you tell her? You have to understand, she wouldn't let me go unless I said something. Bindu, just spit it out. I said you ate a frog. I don't know. It was the first thing that came to my mind. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Wow. Okay. It's fine. I can see it. Fits the whole "Satanic cult" narrative. Yeah, yeah. Holly was saying something about you trying to kill a priest. Yes. Apparently I killed a priest. I can't believe that's still making the rounds. Hey! - Car wash token. - Car wash token. This is a bust. I'm gonna go bother Rob, see if he has anything on him. I'll see you later. - Peter? - Yeah. I'm really sorry about the frog story. Yeah. I mean, stay tuned. Maybe I'll find a tasty frog on the way to Rob. Hey, look who's missing fourth period. Kid, how'd it go today? It, um, was the beginning of the end. Damn, fucking see this? She's a box person. Hey, box person. Open the box. Oh, no. No, no, I'm cool on my own. Okay. Take it, take it. Take it. - What is this? - It's a joint. Weed? Your people call it ganja? Shouldn't I feel something? Maybe you have a high tolerance. Or maybe it's fake. Oh, really? You think it's fake? I bet you'll be stoned off your ass real soon. How much? Yeah. Yeah, how much? How much what? - How much do you bet? - Okay. I'll pay you five dollars... for each toke you take. I don't know what a toke is, but how about five dollars for each time I inhale? Oh, yeah? Okay, so we're doing this? Okay. All right, sounds good. Bring on the tokens, huh? That's one. - Breathe into it. - Okay, okay, okay. What's that? - What's what? - You didn't hear that? All right, that's enough, that's enough. I feel a-okay! Twenty dollars! No, don't. Look who's on her back again. You know what, Sam? You're just mean to me because you like me. Yeah. Yes. Yes! Sam loves you. That's it. Yes, he does. You got it. Bindu, are you all right? - She tripped. - Yeah, she should watch where she's going. - She could have gotten hurt. - That's enough. Are you okay? Why would I be? Yes, you just accused the guy who's been tormenting you of being in love with you. But there are worse things. Genocide, nuclear war, pit stains, Trump. What? Bindu. Why are you crying? That was supposed to be funny. I took the marijuanas. - I think I'm gonna die. - Okay. Um, how high are you? I don't know. I was... I was happy for a moment, and then all of a sudden, I wasn't by a lot. Also everyone was maybe dancing. Okay. That is pretty high. Oh, no. - What? - No. No, I can't go to Drivers Ed. It's so dark in there. And then those scary videos. - I just... - Mm-hmm. - What are you doing? - Come on, grab your bag. I'm gonna make sure you ace that Spanish proficiency exam. Hmm? Hmm? Mm-mmm. Hmm. Well... Gracias. There you weirdoes are. Peter, I hope you told her she can't be going around doing shit like that. Oh. Oh. I'm helping her study for Spanish so she can test out of school. Wait, what do you mean she's testing out? If I get enough money by seventh period, I can take the Spanish... Wait, is that why you hit me up for ten bucks? - Uh... - He told me that he lost a library book and his mom was going to kill him. I'm sorry. Hey... no, come on. Don't be like that, man. Okay? I'm not helping her test out, Pete. She stays here, she helps me get into Stanford. You can't take her to Stanford with you. This is stealing from me. You've been stealing from her. You made her do your homework. Really? We're doing this? Over her? Maybe we are. Idiot. Will he stay mad at you? Maybe. Don't worry about Rob. Worry about what you're going to do when you get out of here. Bindu? Bindu. What are you gonna do when you get out of here? Oh, um... Convince my mom to let me go home. Home? India. Doesn't everyone there want to come here? Not everyone. Right. Yeah. Uh, sorry. Are you at all worried about what you might be missing out on? Like? I don't know. High school. Just seems like a super big thing to miss. Yeah. Uh... Chapter four? Yeah. Let's learn about this dude, Carlos. What are these? Hmm? This is Bill's box. What if she finds them? This is going into the garage, please. Chaudry residence. Oh, hello, Bill. Speak of the devil. Yeah, yeah, she's right here. Hold on. Hi, lovely. Bindu got asked to a dance. What dance? Uh, I guess there's a dance next week and Bindu got asked. Asked? By who? A high school dance, it's a very American tradition. The boy buys a girl a corsage. We take lots of pictures to put on the fridge. It's totally normal. No, Bill, I don't think so. She's very young for all this. No, it's normal for a girl her age to go to a dance. Honestly, it's very innocent. She called me in-between class periods. She... she was very excited. She wants to get a dance ticket. She's only 15. Well... What if she goes to just this one dance this one time? I promise, it's... it's very innocent. Why is this important to you? Well, how can it not be? I come into her life, I turn her world upside down. The least I can do is help her get to a dance. I appreciate the sentiment, but I can't change the rules all of a sudden. Well, I could drive them. I'll drive them there and back. Make sure there's no funny business whatsoever. Bill... When I say no boys, I mean it. I can't bend the rules just because you feel bad, no? Welcome to parenting. It's all about consistency. Sometimes you just have to be the bad guy. Of course. I understand. I love you, babe. Love you. What? I let Smirthi go to dances. With boys? I let her go with friends. Some are boys. Her father hates it but she has a strict curfew. This whole thing... It's all work in progress. Bill is a good man. ...with such strict rules. You couldn't even follow such a strict regimen. I don't need this lecture right now. Let me handle this. So, yeah, drink lots of water and, you know, be careful. Marijuana is the gateway drug. Okay, whatever that means. All right, I'll see ya. Oh, uh... Actually... Hello? Peter? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold up. Slow down. It's nothing weird, just... Just chill. What do you want? I heard you're hitting up everyone for money. I'm gonna leave. Hear me out, just... Look, I have 40. Seriously. Come on, I come in peace. No, thanks. Listen... I know I've been shitty. It's a peace offering. Just t... I don't need all of it. What's this for, anyway? Why does it matter? It does to me. It's for a Spanish test Okay. Well... You better go and fetch it, then. Put that down. Put it down. Dude, why is she floating like that? I don't know. Fuck! Is she... We got to get out of here. Boo. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, you fucking... Fuck! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Why do you hate me? Let me guess. It's, um... It's because I'm uncool, or something stupid like that. Right? Well newsflash: being cool is overrated. I've been spending all this time trying to figure out what I did to annoy you, but I just realized that you probably don't even know. Yeah, just be mean to the new kid. You know, that's so predictable. I mean, come on. I'm drowning in every possible, imaginable way... What are you... Shit. Are you okay? You must think I'm a freak. - I mean... - Blowing my wad like that. Um... I heard you and MacKenzie broke up. Yep. Now I'm just the dude who's failing all of his classes without even a girlfriend. Yeah, it... it'll... it'll be... It's just that... everybody knows. You know? I just wish that I could say, hey, look over there. And walk the other way. Yeah, trust me, I get that. You know... What we just did, it's the least I can do. Uh... [camera shutter clicks] I don't think I can take this. I'm not going to tell anyone. Trust me, neither will I. Are you sure? What about your, uh... what about your test? Maybe I won't take the test after all. - Really? - No, just kidding, I'm definitely taking that test. Okay. Well... See you around. Or not. Later. What? What in the actual fuck? Aren't these Sam's shorts? What the hell? Dude, dude. That was legend-God-damn-derry. You nailed it! Okay, I sent it to just a few friends. Sent what? Sam! You're the man. Everyone knows you're the man. Sam the man. Sam the man! Why does she have money? Who was giving her money? Hey, guys, guys! I've been looking everywhere for you. Guess what just happened? I just beat Sam and Trenton at their own game. She's kidding, right? How is this happening? How can this be real? You know what? You were right, Pete. She needs to get out of this place before she ruins everything. Sam gave me a note to meet him at the pool. I thought we made peace. Moved on. I thought he liked me. Sam likes you like a cat likes a mouse. Who could ever like me, right? No. That's not... That's not what I meant. Hey... I'm going to help you get to the bottom of this. Right? This isn't over. It isn't... but it's about to be. I'm taking that test. This is the last time he'll get me. Whore. You check out my ass in third, and then you're stripping for my boyfriend by fifth? No, I was looking at your tattoo. Also, did you guys break up? He doesn't want you! Come out here! Everybody knows who you took that picture with. To think he dumped me? Me! You can have him, I don't want him! For you! Come out here! Great, and now you made me late for geography. Ugh! Please! Please don't do this to me! Wait... Hello? Wait, no, I have to take a test! I guess you're gonna fail. No, please! Open the door, please! Hello? Is anyone out there? Hello? Just in time. $57. Let me just put that in the cash box. Which one of you is her mom? That would be me. There will be chaperones, right? Just the proctor. We find one is usually enough. Only one? Uh, surely there'll be some rules. Right? Like a dress code? What she had on earlier today should be fine. Such a lovely, colorful ensemble. What? But shouldn't the winter formal be a little bit more formal? Oh, the winter formal, well, yes, I'm wearing a lovely satin sheet thanks to shapeware, but... we don't want our student to be uncomfortable when they're taking a test. Test? What test? The one you just paid for. Here. Would you call my daughter? Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Hey, do you hear me? Hello! Hey! Hey! Hello? No! No! Hello? Bindu Chaudry to the front office. She's never lied to me. She's never lied to me. Hmm? She's not like this. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Can anybody hear me? Hello? Stop it. Please. Enough. No. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. Bindu Chaudry to the front office now. Go fudge yourselves. Go fudge yourselves! Go freak yourselves! Go fudge off. Go freak yourselves. Go duck yourselves! Go fly a kite... Just eff off! She's not in her history class. Okay, Mrs. Benson. Thank you. What kind of a school is this? Where is my daughter? Why don't you text her? Text her. The level of incompetence in this school is just... The level of incompetence, I swear. There she is. See? It was probably just a bathroom emergency. That's my daughter. Oh, I could've sworn it was her. They could be twins! Smirthi, do you know what's going on with Bindu? When did you last see her? I don't know. Smirthi! Where is Bindu? Smirthi! Okay, okay, look, you cannot freak out if I show you something. Oh! Oh, my God. I need to see the principal, please. You need an app... I need to see the principal. This way. I'm getting out of here. Bindu Chaudry to the front office. I'm coming! I'm coming! Bindu Chaudry to... Can I have one more dollar? Please, anything. Can I please borrow a dollar, I just need a dollar. Anything? Can I please borrow a dollar. Do you have anything? No, okay. Can I please borrow a dollar? Hello? Please? I just need a dollar! Please! A dollar! I know how you can make ten dollars. You can blow the varsity and JV football teams. Well, why don't you, Trenton? What was that? Hey, look who's... look who's eating linoleum? Leave it! Come on! Let's go! Come on. Fuck you, Petey! I don't have it all. What are we going to do about this? - I don't know anything about... - Uh... Don't worry about it. I want these people expelled! Right now, sir! Is that my mom? I tell you what we're going to do. This fall, we're going to finish installation of security cameras across the campus so we can keep a better eye on the students. Now... you know, fingers crossed with budget cuts and all. But that's going to be able to increase our efficiency in watching these kids. This is going to help a lot. You don't even know who's taking these photos. Once again, once again, so you're saying - this will be next fall? - Yes. How is it helping me and my daughter right now? Well, that's a good point. You know what we could do? I've got a great idea, what we could do is hold some kind of a rally. Think about it, anti-bullying... Oh, hey, Bindu, what do you think about that idea? And that's what we're working towards, because that's the Rocket way. Sir, just... that's my daughter and let's just get this over with. I don't want to be coming here again. Thank you. Mom, Mom... Okay, understood. Where did you get all that money from? Um... It's a long story. Oh, great, we found her. How is she? Why don't you ask Bindu yourself? Bindu, are you okay? I don't want to talk to you. My daughter... and all of this money... This money showing her breasts off to the entire school. It's probably because of all the filthy magazines around the house. What? Amma, I didn't show anyone my... How can I believe you? I don't even know who you are. I don't know where you've been. Where have I been? Where have you been, Ma? It was just you and me and then you throw me into the deep end. People are putting shaving cream in my lockers, and they're throwing things at me and you put me here in this big pile of shit. Language! Shit, shit, shit! You do not get to act so self-righteous, when you and Bill are having sex every night. I hear it! I hear all of it! Oh, oh! Oh, Bill! Oh, Bill! You know what? Bill was right. You are just stuck in your silly little ways. Is that what you think of me? She just wanted to go to a dance and make friends. She doesn't need to be friends with those people. Well, who is she supposed to be friends with, you? Just you? You're not the parent here. You don't get to do the parenting here. I'm not... What are we doing here? I married you. I take Bindu to school every day. You are still not her father. That's not fair. Don't do this. I'm sorry. Dude... What were you thinking? I don't know. Maybe that my cousin wouldn't abandon me as soon as I started school. How was I supposed to know that you were going to take frickin' nudes? I didn't know I was... It doesn't even matter. Everything and everyone sucks. Bindu... Look, back in middle school someone made up this rumor that I didn't wash my hands in the bathroom. So I made my mom get a bottle of plumeria hand sanitizer. Some of the popular girls liked how it smelled and wanted to be my friend. And the rest is history. I just hoped you'd find something like that, you know? Peter! Peter, hi. Peter, hi! Hey, hey, Rob. What's going on? I got the money. Um, uh, it's a really long story, but I'm going to take the test now. I just wanted to let you know because I saw you coming out of the... Yeah. Amazing. You did it. Yes, we did. You did. - You did. - No, no, no. I, uh... I just wanted to thank you. For everything. I may not see you after, so... You getting all sentimental on me? Oh my gosh, I still can't believe that you punched Trenton. I know, I can't believe it either. - Are you okay? - No, yeah, I'm fine. More like, is he okay? Yeah, right? Well... Knock 'em dead, I mean... Whoa. Okay. Bindu, I think we should... talk after your test. Uh, what's wrong? Nothing, let's just... Let's talk later. There they are. Latecomers get to volunteer. Come on up. Oh, no, Mr. Deedham, I can't... I am waiting to see the new and improved Bindu. This can't be it. Class, today, we are going to find out... I can't right now. ...made of. Now, take these toothpicks, roll them inside your cheeks, and then smear it on to this slide. What is it? I can't tell you right now. Well, just tell me so... Less whispering. More science. Bindu! Come on. Fine. I'm leaving. I can't get it to focus. What the hell is that? Looks like tiny bugs. Um, that's... that's not how it's supposed to look. In one second I'm sure it will all be fine. It's cum. What? Oh... oh fuck. Um... Whose slide is this? - Whose slide is this? - Bindu. Whose slide is this? Bindu, is this some sort of joke? No. Uh... It's, um... Uh, actually... Bindu! Come on, let's go, you're going to miss your test. Someone's a cocksucker. Sam, that's enough. It's mine. Peter, go sit down. I'm sorry. The whore strikes back, huh? Cumslut. Sam, that's detention. Bindu, is this some sort of joke? No. I blowjobbed Sam right before class. I knew it, you fucker. Hell no, fuck you. No thank you, you premature ejaculator. - Bindu? - What? - Go to the principal. - Fine. By the way... all of you can go and fuck yourselves! Sit down. You have detention as well. Pretend like it didn't happen. You're so dead. Fuck it. Well, sorry you had to come in, but... she had a bad day. Thank you. You're welcome. We're rooting for her. Trish? Bye, Bindu. Hey. Fuck the box people. - Language. - Sorry. - That makes no sense. - So sorry. High school really sucks. Yeah, it can. I'm sorry I ever made you go. But believe it or not, it does get better. How do you know? I got an idea. You know what I do when I get all those thoughts? I just stuff 'em in that box. That's really weird, Bill. Well... I'm weird. So are you. And so what? You should try it. You're serious. Yeah. Put your problems in the box. This can't be healthy. You got it. You never know. Yeah. So... what happens now? I don't know. That's all I got, I'm new to this. Sorry. Me, too. Kind of. How am I doing? You'll get better with practice. You know, I didn't do any of the things - they said I did. - Yeah. I know. Do you want to come inside? I think... You and your mom need some time alone. How do you think she's going to take this? Well, she'll be really mad at first, and then eventually she'll come around. She really loves you. You've got to remember that. Wait. I, uh... I left something. See you later, kiddo. Thank you. Does she know I'm here, kiddo? No. - I'm scared. - Shh. I just thought we needed another hand in the kitchen. Bill, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They're pretty. They're fake, but they last forever. Okay, guys, don't make me regret this. You haven't been in class. Yeah, well, uh, apparently blowjobs are grounds for suspension. Why didn't you say anything? Well, you were about to leave, so... Didn't seem like the right time. Also, uh... I was worried you might just tell me to try to blend in. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Also, I've never said it out loud. To anyone, and... I couldn't say it then. You can say it now. Yeah. Okay. I'm gay. Someone once told me that it would feel good to just let it out. Don't worry, I'm not going to kiss you. Oh, okay, good. Do you want to come inside? Oh, Lord, no. - Okay. - I'm going home. Okay, yeah. Don't be weird. I can't help it. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye. Do you want us to come inside? Thanks, but I'll be okay. Call if you need anything. - Answer the call. - Okay, Mom. You'll be great, kiddo. Have fun, learn things! What do you do when they offer you drugs? Too late for that. No. No, thank you. I'm cool on my own. She knows. - She knows? - She knows. I'm pretty sure she knows. - Oh, gosh. - Your mom is way smarter than you think. Hey... there's your little man. - Hey. - Hey. You all right? I think so. - It'll be fine. - I bet no-one even remembers. What was it, a week? So much has happened. Yeah, honestly, people move on to new stuff. Anyone looking at me? Not really. Oh, shit. That's gotta hurt. Come on.
