- Think about it, man. You shoot me, who are you gonna pin this shit on? You wouldn't pin it on Indi. Sweet, harmless Indi wouldn't hurt a fly. Then, of course, there's Elliot, but even a dog like you wouldn't hang his only best mate out to dry like that. What about Halley? Because if I'm gone, and you're not pinning this on the other two, then it's gotta be Halley. Would you let Halley take it for you, again? One more fucking word. One more- That's how you take care of fucking business! - So what's this about? Just a friendly little chat? A little pow wow? Ah, a not so friendly pow wow. Well, what can I do for you? - You can start by- - No, I don't remember asking you- - You can start by taking that glass of H2O. - Like this? - Now drink, Arthur. - For crying out loud, knock it off, both of you! - The lady's right, let's stop measuring dicks. What can I do for you? - Do you know what these are? - Appears some little coward didn't have the sack to look the man in the eye. - I don't know what you're on about. You've been after me for years anyway. So why don't you take that raging hard-on of yours and put it to good use. - We were hoping you'd be more cooperative than this. Mr. Cork. - Yeah, well I'm here, aren't I? And you bastards still haven't said why. - Arthur? Arthur- - My name's Yale. Arthur? - Nah I'm not saying anything! - Arthur, I want to know, why did he have to die, Arthur? - Don't know what you're talking about. You can start by telling us where you were yesterday afternoon and into the evening. - I was seeing a movie. - A movie? - A movie. - What movie, Mr. Cork? - "The Usual Suspects." Two rules, it's always two rules, kids. Remember, you heard it here first. It's always us and them. - Who now? - Them. - Who is them? - Think about it. What makes the world turn? Money. You either have it or you don't. - Yeah and it's like, no matter how hard we work, we just can't get ahead. - Oh, you work? - OK, so maybe not how hard I work, but I get where he's coming from though. - And where is he coming from? - I'd say he's coming from over there? - We need to send a message. - What kinda message? - A very loud and a very clear message. We need to send a message to all those rich fucks who sit up there all high and mighty, looking down on us. Yeah, the ones that just throw all their cash around and... I don't, I don't fucking know, and just, they're assholes though. - Well done. - Oh, cut it out. I don't know about any of you, but when was the last time that you felt safe and sound, and didn't have to worry about anything? See, those rich fucks, they don't have to worry about that. They always feel safe, and they're never worrying about having to scrape by to survive. I can't remember the last time I had a decent steak. - You want some of my steak sandwich? You ordered a... Who do you think's fucking paying for that? - I'm not sure, guess I'm not worrying about my next meal. - You know the houses on Balfour Avenue? Oh, I'd love to live there one day. - Better start saving those pennies then. Or learn to lay down and use it as cash register. - You know, it's funny about Balfour Avenue, but, such a nice, quiet, little neighborhood, rich as hell though. - Yeah, it's so nice. Hey, you remember that one girl we went to school with? She was like that perfect little princess. Annalise, that was her name. Her father was this big time investor guy. - Was this the girl who didn't wanna tug Elliott - behind the toilet block? - Mm-hm, yep. - Said it had something to do with her reluctance to, "Wank the Yank?" - You fucking asshole! Does she still live there though? - I think so. - Was this the guy who killed his wife? - Oh! Yeah, he beat the charge! - What? - Yeah, beat the charge. The witness up and left. - Up and left? - Mm. Turned up in Spain somewhere, refused to come back and fucking testify. - Who was this now? - Ah, I don't know, ah, a cleaner. Said this old guy, ah, what's his name? I don't know, I've never met him. - Well, said this girl's father drank a half bottle of Scotch. - Oh yeah, what kind? - Ah, a good one, shut the fuck up. Go on. - Yeah, then the missus turned up, they got into an argument about something, then he pulled out a pistol. That's all she wrote. - And this guy just fucking moves the witness on? So the story goes. - That's fucked! - Piece of shit. - This is what I'm telling you, money. The rich are literally getting away with murder. - And where'd you hear about it all? - Oh, it was in all the papers. Since when do you fucking read papers? - I don't, but I did use them as blankets for a while. Kept me sleepless for three nights! Fucking great read! - Didn't know you could. - Shut your legs Indi, your breath stinks. - You're such a dick- - Enough! What about the girl? Don't know, but she was pretty hot back then, but I don't know- - Fuck! Try and understand what I'm asking you for fuck sake! - What are you asking? - He's asking if you know what happened to Annalise. - She stayed with her dad. Uh, she never talked about it. I don't think she was old enough to know what was going on. - No, just old enough to know that Mummy wasn't gonna come back and tuck her end of the night. Another Mother bites the dust. - Fuck this, we're all beating around the obvious here. - Uh, what's the obvious? - I think we have an opportunity here. - There you go. - To exact some justice for the fallen woman of the house, and send a very clear and loud message. - How clear? - Crystal. I just wished we knew where this rich bastard lived. Any way, we could do this, how about it? - I'm always up for anything. Fuck off, Seth. - Follow the leader. - I even have the perfect house. Did you shit yourself? Nah, that's the dumpsters man. - Fuck, that is- - I didn't fucking shit myself, all right! - You sure, mate? - That's the dumpsters, I'm telling you. - It sure looks like it. Fuck off! Is this the bottle shop? Yeah, man. - Hey, yo, do you want anything before we head off? - Nah, I'm all right. Ah, nah, can I pinch a smoke? - All right. Got a light? - You boys need ciggies? Got cash? Yeah, yeah, I got some. What to choose, man. How ya doin', man? Just those three, thanks. Ah, yeah, sure, fuck. Every time man. Every time. Come on, you look like you're 15. Fuck off, man. Thanks, man. Cheers. Ah, could we get those in bags? Yeah, cheers. - Thank you. Busy night? Nah, no need for receipt, man. They're gonna be gone the second we walk out. No, don't tell him that. He doesn't give a shit, man. Probably he'd do the same thing in our shoes. Cheers, man. - Cheers. - Take it easy. Ooh, sorry. You have a good night. - Need an opener? - I might need an opener, yeah. - Yeah, I got one. - Give me that. - All right. - Oi! Me first. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, you're good. - Come on man, we're not here to fuck spiders. - Yeah, this one's a piece of shit but. Fuck me. - So, I've got Deano holding at the party. - Yeah? - Do you guys want any? - Uh, I mean, if you have to ask the question, you know. - All right. What's he got? "What's he got?" Are you a dumbass or what? - Just a bit of whizz, you'll be right. Fuck, you drink some shit. What percentage is this? I don't know, man. Are you serious? What? "What percentage is this?" Fuck, you're a girl. The fuck, I've still got drinks at the party. I don't want to waste my money and fucking get wasted already. Fuck! So I got a welfare meeting, on Thursday now, because I haven't been for any Job Search for the last two, three months. - Ah, yeah? - Didn't you hand in that resume at that, uh- - Nah, she won't, she won't take it. - Huh, hold up, hold up, hold up. Check this shit out. What? It's not bad. Nah, it's got an alarm. - That's all right. - Forget it man. Nah, we can make this happen. Dude. Come on, let's go, guys. - What do- - Come on, leave it. - I'm having a look. Just fucking sit still. We'll come back tomorrow, see if it's in a different spot out of the lights. Aww, fuck me it's cold, boys. Tell me about it. I can see your nipples through your shirt. Shut up. There's some nice cars around. - Yuppy-ville, man. - Yeah, upper-crust fucks. - What time, Mr. Cork? Ah, It was at 2:45. I remember that, because I was there. See, I caught a bus, the 100. I don't have a car at the moment, unfortunately. - Car thefts are down at the moment. - Well, that's good to know. Ah, there was this old lady on the bus. All these young boys, they were ignoring her, so I gave her my seat. - Why did you do that? - Well, because my mother raised me right, Detective. This woman have a name? - Probably. But there was something that did strike me, while I was on the bus. - Go on, Mr. Cork. - There was this couple, a young couple. He had blonde hair, she was red-headed, and she was scared. I was just sitting there. He wouldn't acknowledge her, wouldn't even hold her hand. Why did that strike you Arthur? - Because I don't like women beaters. - How did you know he was a woman beater? - Well, I've developed a bit of an eye for that. - First-hand experience? - I've never touched a woman. Never? Have I wanted to? Yeah. From time to time, but I've never. - Have you seen this girl before, Mr. Cork? - Nah. Haven't seen her. She looks scared. Bit like the girl on the bus. Who's she? - We were hoping you could tell us, Arthur. Seeing as your print was found at the scene. - That is not my name. This says it was a partial print, on a gate. And that address, that's a main road. I walk by there all the time. I could have brushed that when I was going to the bus. - Before we continue, are you now saying, just so that we're clear, are you now saying that you've never before seen the young girl in the photograph? - That's what I'm saying. What's it about? - What's what about? The movie, Arthur. - You and that fucking name. - The movie, Mr. Cork. - What about it? - What's it about? - "The Usual Suspects?" - We know the title, Arthur - Yeah, but that's also what it's about, the usual suspects. Being dragged in by the law, to confess for the sins of others. It's a bit like me. - Is that how you feel, Mr. Cork? That we're asking you to confess to something you may not have done? - No. Not at all, Detective George. - Have you got something on ya, Arthur? Something that might show us that you actually made the session? You know what, I didn't keep the ticket stub. - That's OK, Mr. Cork. Do you have anything else then? Bus ticket? - Nah, I didn't pay. Ooh! Did I just confess to fare evasion? What's that, like 200? - Can be 550, if there's history. - Do you have that, Mr. Cork? - What? The money? - She's talking about history, Arthur. You've got a bit of that, don't you? - Don't we all? I bet even you two have history. Oh. Wow. I nailed it. Obviously, you got there before I could. You horny bastards. You know he's married? What, he didn't say? You didn't tell her? I don't blame ya. She's very pretty. You are, very, very pretty. Thank you, Mr. Cork. - Hey, man, I'll just get two please. Thanks, man. Have a good night. Here you are partner. No mustard right? Partner? We don't talk any more? - Now you wanna talk? - What the hell does that even mean? - You know damn well what that means, Detective. Now I'm supposed to open my mouth? Why the hell not? I've already opened up everything else! - Hey, what do you want from me? - Nothing, Matt. I don't want anything from you. Actually, I take that back. I want what anybody else in my position would want. However, seeing as that's not an option, which you've made perfectly clear, I'll settle for a partner, out here, on the job. Beyond that, you can go screw yourself, because I'm not doing it anymore. - He'll be all right. Just doing his job. Can't blame him for that. - Mr. Cork, did you know that- - Call me Yale. - Mr. Cork. Did you know that the young woman in that picture was pregnant? - Pregnant? That poor girl? That's tragic. Can I ask you something? - OK. What makes you two think that I give a fuck, about some dead, knocked up slag? - I was just checking on your empathy levels, Mr. Cork. I'm afraid that tank's a little dry. - Evidently. - Well, this has been fun. Can I go now? - Not quite, Mr. Cork. - Well, what else do you want? You wanna know my favorite color? Favorite food? Position? - I wanna talk to you about Robert Hamilton Stuart. - Can I have one of them? - Babe, you don't smoke. - Tonight's a night of real firsts. - Like a pro, hun. You got a good job? Yes. Does it pay well? Yes. - I bet you have a nice car too. - Yes. - So, this one day, back when I was in school, I saw a group of girls, three or four of them, they were pushing around this little girl. I think they wanted her lunch money or something like that. Now, this little girl, lets call her Vicki. - Why Vicki? - Vicki Victim. Now, Vicki, instead of simply giving into the group, well, she sat there in defiance, and she took every little kick and every punch that that violent little group handed out. Now, I sat there and wondered. I wondered, why did she continue to refuse the group, when it was clear as day they were just going to keep kicking and kicking and punching and punching? And then it hit me! The reason she was so content on taking that beating, that left her beaten and bruised and bloody, was in a word, spirit. Fuck-tons of pure, unadulterated spirit. She was not gonna show them that they could break her spirit. It was honorable to be sure. Stupid, but honorable. - What happened to her? - Well, she ended up in the emergency room, followed by the intensive care unit. It would've just been easier to give in, don't you think? - Well, we're gonna take a look around, OK? C'mon, man, let's do our thing. - I've always wanted a place like this. All right, all right, let's do it your way. The less I know about you, the better. I can hit the strong and silent type. - Well, you really will do anything to avoid work, won't you, Arthur? Only where I can. Did you know Mr. Stuart? - No. - Did you know his daughter? Date her? Anything like that? - No. - I've always wanted a place like this. Filled with such delicate things. - Please don't hurt her. You can beat me all you like, but I beg you, please don't harm her. - "I beg you, please don't hurt her." Ooh! - Why are you doing this? - Well, the reason is. Shit, why are we doing this? - C'mon, you know the reason. The rich get richer. - The poor get poorer. - Don't you worry your fancy little pants off. We're not here to hurt your mistress? Whore? Lady on the side? You dirty old man! For such a distinguished individual, he certainly does have some dirty needs. - She's my daughter, you pathetic cretin. Why don't you get on with it, or whatever it is- Dad! - Your mind can conjure, up, you fucker! - One more little outburst like that the next one, she gets, I'm not fucking around. I'm here, in this lovely sitting room, on this lovely night, having a lovely conversation. Take her upstairs boys. Whatever you please. - No, no, Dad? Dad! Dad! - Where'd you get the tape? - We're on a home invasion, you fuck-up. Always come prepared. One of us has to be the brains. I hope that's not too tight, but, it's better than the, it's better than the alternative. Hey! It'll be all right. OK? Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you, and we're almost done here. Everything will be all right. When I was growing up, my father, was a heavy drinker. - Yep. - Pour me one. Pour yourself one too. Here's looking up your arsehole. Nothing funny now. I'd hate to put two in your chest and one up your arse. Yeah, I promise. - A real my-word-is-my-bond type of guy', aren't you? That's what I had you pegged as. - You don't happen to have anyone that can alibi you, do you? - No, that's something else I don't have. - Oh, that's a shame. Couldn't find a friend? - No, they were working. - Well, that explains why we never see them. - Yep. - Do you work, Mr. Cork? - No, but I've been using Job Search. - How about a bus buddy? - Well, my mum, she taught me not to talk to strangers. - Surprised she could teach you anything, mate, given her unforeseen absence. - That's enough. - We didn't have a place like this growing up. It's not what you would call a supporting, caring, or loving kind of family home. This one night, I came home and my father was standing smack, bang in the middle of the kitchen, with this here firearm against mother dearest's head. Do you want to know what happened? She turned slowly and with such fucking confidence, defiance even, and she began to laugh. The old man didn't like that. We need to cut her a little. What? Are you fucking kidding me? Only a little. Not to kill her or anything. Not to kill you or anything. Just to show you-know-who that we took care of you. Otherwise, he will think we puss-ed out. OK, we need to make sure you won't call the cops or anything like that, a message, you know. - You know, my fucking father was a no-nonsense kind of guy. He sees me and without batting an eyelid, grabs me by the arm and pulls me in front of my mother. - Fuck! I can't believe I'm about to say this. But, he's got a point. Only a little one, OK, we'll be as gentle as possible. I'm not fucking doing it. - Oh, come on, man. I don't have the stomach for it. - Well, it was your fucking idea. - As an idea, it fucking makes sense. - You are a fucking child, man. - Let me cut you a little, OK. If Yale comes up here, we aren't- - All my mother could say, was "Go on, get on with it, you gutless wonder." - What the hell happened? So my dad calmly puts the gun in my hand. - You're hurt. - I'm fine. It's heavy. So he helps me, you see. - That was insane. - Yeah, man. We just cut her up a little bit, so she wouldn't go to the cops. - You cut someone? It was nothing. It was just to show you-know-who we handle business. - Where's Yale? Is he OK? - Well, you really will do anything to avoid work, won't you Arthur? - Only where I can. Did you know Mr. Stuart? - No. Did you know his daughter? Date her? Anything like that? - No. - She's been cooperating with us. - She's coming in today, to look at photographs, you know, pictures. Of guys, with some of that history we talked about. You ladies forgot your purse. She give you some trouble boys? Only a little. But junior here handled business. Down this way. Ooh! - You two look very nice. - Hey, hey, hey. Ladies! What do you say? Drinks are on me. - Well, they may be on you, but soon they'll be in me. - You're such a fucking gronk. - Me? Would it kill you to be less of a bitch than normal? - Hey! She's right though, you are pretty gronk. - What? Fuck off. I guess I'm third wheel, yeah? - Oh, yeah, yeah, no. Actually, I think you're worse than that. - All it's going to look like is Papa Smurf found Baby Smurf less than alive. So, distraught by her blood on the antique furniture, he went downstairs, smashed a few drinks, and bang! Besides this park's huge. No one's gonna know we're here. - Halles, what's wrong? - I'm not sure about all this, Yale. I don't think I can go through with it. - You don't have to worry about anything. You can do this. - No. What if Seth's right? - Don't worry about it. I've planned this perfectly. We planned this perfectly. Don't you trust me? - Of course I trust you. Mr. Cork, while you might not know her, is there any chance that she's going to know you? - Not a chance. Like I said, Detective, I was in the movies, and when I got out, I had lunch. Well, a late lunch. - Why late? - Well, by the time the session finished, it was about five o'clock. - Wouldn't that make it an early dinner? - Maybe for you. - Hello? No. No. I'm not all right. I'm not OK. Uh, these. What do you mean? No, they've left. No, no. I'm not hurt or injured. To your location. They should be there within the next 10 or so minutes. I need you to remain where you are, and I need you to stay on the phone with me. Can you do that? - Yes. Yeah, I can. That's great, ma'am. You're doing great. It's almost over. Where are you? - Um, what do you mean? - In the home. Where are you currently? - I'm in the upstairs bathroom. Is the door locked? Yeah, yeah, the door's locked. I want you to stay put until the officers arrive. OK. Can you tell me what happened? - Um, I came home, and I had a shower, and I hopped on my bed, and I had my headphones on, so he couldn't hear me, and he couldn't, I couldn't do anything. He couldn't hear me, I couldn't do anything. It's, it's OK. You're doing great. It's, it's OK. You're gonna be fine. Sweetheart? It, it's OK. - What's your name? - Annalise. - Annalise. That's a very special name. - Why is it special? - My dear, it's very special. It means graced with God's bounty. - Guys. We've got a problem. - Fuck! What is it? - We begin this evening's broadcast with a violent home invasion, in the affluent suburb of Stanford Hills Estate. Earlier this evening, three young men, one, armed, stormed a home, where they threatened and held captive the owner, Mr. Robert Hamilton Stuart. Mr. Stuart had been taken to the emergency room, with a suspected gunshot wound. However, efforts to save Mr. Stuart were unsuccessful. The assailants escaped in a 2017, black, BMW Sedan, reportedly stolen, with a significant sum of money, jewelry, and high-end alcohol. Police say they have one witness who is cooperating, but have yet to release any further details. Police are urging Stanford Hills Estate residents with- - Fuck! Nothing can fucking go wrong, huh? What do you fucking call this then! We are fucked! - We're not fucked. All we have to do is ditch the car and lay low. No one can prove anything. We just disappear. I don't care what anyone says. We took care of business. No witnesses. Just some snobby neighbor, who thinks she saw the car, that's it. - Yeah, he's right. Ditch the car. We'll meet back here in a couple of hours, OK? We need to be far, so far away from here, and then we go underground, yeah? - Agreed. That's the plan. We stick with that. Elliot, you take the keys, you ditch the car. Stay off the main streets, stay out of the shadows. - No, no, hang on. - No, no, no. That's the plan. That's it. Let's go. - Yeah, OK. Just, just, stick to the plan. - Idiot! Come on... Come on, we'll be fine. Would you calm down? - Are you shitting me? We broke into some poor old bastard's place, robbed it, trashed it, you fucking toyed with him like some psycho tearing the wings off flies, fucking killed him, for what, man? - No one forced you to come. You came of your own free will, just like we all did. We are tired of the haves having more than the have-nots and now they'll all know, they're not any fucking better than we are. Oh, keep telling yourself that, mate. You're fucking deluded. You're not some fucking freedom fighter. You know why I had to be there right? I had to be there for when you fucked it up. Where are we going? - You know where we're going. - Fuck's sake, Yale. You right? Yeah, I'm right. It's just fucking, we gotta get going. C'mon, let's go. - Babe, we should split up. Wait, what, why? - Because together we're creating too much attention, we're just better off separate. - Separate? We're just two girls walking in and out of dangerous dark alleyways. - Sarcasm really doesn't work for you, kitty cat. Stick to what you know. Anyway, by now, the cops have probably found your fella's handiwork. - He's not my fella. - Oh, come on, baby girl, of course he is. You're just getting your feet wet with him now. - What are you gonna do? - Me? I'm gonna go and get something to eat, something to drink, and then, I'm gonna go to the meetup. And after all that loot is divvied up, Elliot and I are on that sweet bird to freedom. - What about me? - My dear, you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do. Just make sure whatever that is, it's for the right reasons. Not his, not mine, not anyone else's. - Should I go? - Enough, Halley! You go your way, I'll go mine. - I'll see you at the warehouse, yeah? - If we're all lucky. Any available metro units currently online? New job across, abandoned vehicle. Any available units? Base, Central 5 online, you got the details of that abandoned vehicle? Central 5, Base yeah, the abandoned vehicle, a late model, black BMW Sedan. Incidentally, it's the same make and model as a vehicle reported stolen from the scene of an earlier 101. Suspects whereabouts currently unknown. Proceed with caution to the boat ramp off Dixon street. You're Code 2. Copy, Central 5 is code 2. - It's a receipt. Sertraline. Base, this is Central 5. We've finished up with the abandoned car, we are following up on new intel. Central 5 online. - Keep going. Keep going. We gotta find somewhere. Fuck me, you're a girl. Here, open that one. - What? - Open the door. - It's locked. - Well, use that pretty little knife, you cut that pretty little girl's face with. - Why don't you kick the fucking door in, 'cause you're a massive fucking Goliath- - Open the fucking door. Open the door, now! Get that light. I'll message the girls, let 'em know where we are, see how Halles is. - Are you fucking serious, Yale? She seem OK to you? Fucking worried about her, are you? Worried about someone else other than yourself for a change? Fuck me, you are a piece of work, I'll give you that. You know, we've really fucked up, man. - Fuck, you too. - No, no, no. First, the house isn't empty and now, the fucking cops. Yeah, and then the fucking old guy that you tore to shreds. You are a maniac, man. Seth, take it easy, man. - Take it? I'm tired of taking it easy. "Take it easy." Maybe I should start taking it easy with you, Yale. The illustrious Yale, always coming up with the fucking super ideas, the brilliant plans, and when they fuck up, we all pay for it. - Seth. - No, shut the fuck up, Elliot. This needs to be said. Yale fucks things up, and we all pay for it. Fucking gutless fuck. Hanging us out to dry. What are you gonna do? Huh? Can't be any worse than this situation you've put us in. Come on. Show everyone how you can fuck things up even more. Oh fuck! - I won't fucking tell you again. Plenty more where that come from. - Fuck! Always has to be the hero, huh? Even when he's the fucking cause. Oh fuck! Yale, man. What the fuck? - One more time. I'm not fuckin' around. - Or what, are you gonna shoot me? Wasn't part of your plan, was it? But so much of tonight wasn't part of your plan, was it? Huh? The robbery, the robbery, sure. And the scare tactics with the old-guy, but the girl, that wasn't part of your plan, was it? What the fuck are you on about? - What the fuck am I on about? Murder! Wasn't part of the fucking plan! It sure as shit wasn't part of my plan, to commit murder. Not what I fucking signed on for. - But murder was part of your night, wasn't it? You and him, that girl, cut her from ear to fucking ear, for all I know. So you're just as responsible as I am. If not more, you dumb cunt! - Oh yeah, that girl. Yeah, didn't kill her mate. She's still breathing. - What the fuck are you on about? That fucking girl, no. That fucking girl, the fucking girl, we took care of, that blood, the blood, you's fucking took care of business. - Yeah, you saw the blood, but you didn't see the fucking body. And the news has the one witness that's helping the cops. - Do you fucking know about this? - Hey, what the hell, man? - Hey, Elliot didn't know shit, OK. Okay. I told him, "I got this. "Let me take care of business." He went downstairs and started to sift through the house, and I fucking told her all about you, mate. Now who's the dumb cunt. - Nah, you're fucking lying. You're a liar! You are a weak liar. - If I'm a weak, fucking liar, go ahead and shoot me. No, no, no. No, everyone's gonna calm down. No one's shooting anyone tonight. - Yeah, he won't. - Oh, won't I? - Think about it, man. You shoot me, who you gonna pin this shit on? You wouldn't pin it on Indi. Sweet, harmless Indi, wouldn't hurt a fly. Then, of course, there's Elliot, but even a dog like you, wouldn't hang his only best mate out to dry like that. What about Halley? 'Cause if I'm gone, and you're not pinning it on the other two, then it's gotta be Halley. Would you let Halley take it for you, again? - One more fucking word. One more- OK, kiddies, you play nice, and Daddy's gonna go get the welcome home fiesta for my baby girl. Hun, you want anything special? Don't worry about it, I'll surprise ya, I'll surprise ya. - I don't know if you wanna talk about it, but we've had a thought. - Yeah, hun, we're worried about you. I mean, now that you're out, back home, we think it's time we did something else. Something else? - Something else, like without Yale around. - Without Yale. - It isn't right, what happened. - Yeah, it's not fair. - It won't happen again. - Don't you think he's gonna have issues, when he sees us trying to go our own way? - Look, I have a plan, that might seem a little extreme at first, but ultimately will spell freedom for all of us. - Yeah, I'm with these guys, Halley. We need to do something now, something immediate. We're gonna end up in prison, like you. - Shut the fuck up! - You asshole! - What? Well, we might end up dead. - I'm not interested. It was a one time thing, he feels terrible. - He couldn't give two fucks about you, baby girl. - We always take the fall! I have a record, and I haven't committed a fucking crime yet. - I mean, come on, he forced you into that stupid- - Messed up- - Fucking horrible situation. - And you got pinched. To make matters worse, he picked you up in the very fucking car, that he stole, that put you there in the first place. - If I were to go along with it, what would we do? - That's up to my man, Seth. - Up to the, the who and the what, now? - C'mon man, it would mean more if it came from you. Now, plus we are all in this together. Don't puss out. - Agreed. - Agreed. - OK, I'm in. - I even have the perfect house. - Keys, keys. I've abandoned my keys! Keys, keys. Got the keys, keys, chocolate bar, cherry ripe. Done. Got it. - What about Halley? Because if I'm gone, and you're not pinning it on the other two, then it's gotta be Halley. Would you let Halley take it for you, again? One more fucking word. One more. - That's how you take care of fucking business! Are you fucking kidding me? Go! That fucking guy, fucking Seth, the fuck just- - Listen, I don't think he's gonna- - He'll be all right, he's all right. Fuck me. All right, so what do we do now? We get, we get fuckin' moving, we get out of here. No, don't! I fuckin', I warned him, I fuckin' warned him. You heard me warn him. Hey party-goers! What a crazy fuckin' night! Ow, what the fuck? - You think? He'll, he'll be all right? Do you think, he'll be all right, eh? I, I only, I only clipped him. Surely he'll be, but you, but you heard him, he left a witness to find, behind for us to get caught. For us to get, take the wrap. What's he talking about? - It doesn't matter, we have to keep moving. - Where's Seth? Has Halley turned up yet? What do you mean, where's Halley? - Well, we split up, we thought it would be better if, uh, safer, if we split up. Well, where is she? - I don't know, she went her way, and I went mine. All available units, we have a code 303 in progress, a report of shots fired. - Seth! Seth? What happened, Seth, can you hear me? - Halley, you have to go. - No, no, no, we need to stop the bleeding. - Go, Halley. Halley, run! - Where's Seth? - He's dead. - What? - Seth's dead! - How? - He set us up, the selfish prick. He thought it up from the start, he left a witness. - That girl from the house? - How did you know that? - It was in the newscast. - No, na, na, na, na, no. The newscaster only said that, "A witness was cooperating." They didn't say shit about a girl, so how, how could you know that it, how did you know about that? - Hey, hey, hey. All right, it's nothing like that. Just don't hurt her. - Take it easy, please don't. - I wanna hear her, pal. Don't look to him. Look at me. Right here. I'm the king of the castle. - When, when you were still inside, and Halley and I were waiting, Elliot and Seth. Jeepers, Seth. - Suck it up. - When they came back, they had, they had blood on their shirts, and they said they cut her, but they'd left her alive. - Why did they leave her alive? Why cut her at all? - They cut her so that you would think that they handled business. - So you knew that tweedle-dumb and tweedle dead-cunt were setting me up. - Well, only- - Stop talking. Indigo. I don't care. You don't care? - I don't care, it's OK, it's all right. - Why is it OK? Why don't you care? How, how is this OK? - Indigo, sweet, little Indigo. It's OK, because you wouldn't hurt a fly. You're not a threat, so you get a pass. - What does that even mean? - It means that you are going to pretend that you had nothing to do with this evening's events. - I was at home, watching TV. - It means that you are leaving now, tonight. - Where am I going? - I don't give three shits! But how will you find me? - I won't! I don't know you! And I don't know you. It was supposed to be fun. Us versus them. - I'm having a blast! - All right, moving on. Do you happen to know anything about a stolen Mini? Really? Oh, that's classic, that's ironic. Nothing? Not fans of classic cinema? "The Italian Job," 1969, Sir Michael Caine, Benny Hill? It's a great flick. - I'm not following, Mr. Cork. Well, "The Italian Job" is about a caper performed using Mini Coopers. Now you're telling me someone's pulled a caper, to steal Mini Coopers. It's classic. You seem to be quite the movie buff, Mr. Cork. - That's the benefits of not having a job, isn't it, Arthur? I'm gonna go and check and see if the witness has arrived. You sit tight, Arthur. - Yeah, no, we'll be fine. - So. So, you saw a movie, had a late lunch, arrived by bus, offered your seat to an elderly woman who probably had a name. That about the gist of it? - Yep - What time did you leave the cinema complex? - Late. - Are you inclined to say closer to 8:00, 10:00, later? - Later, definitely later. - The complex closes at 10, what were you still doing there? - The complex closes at 10 to shoppers, but the last session's like 9:45, gets out close to midnight. I ask again. What were you still doing there? I was enjoying myself. - Enjoying yourself? - Look, can I go? I've got things to do. - Of course, Mr. Cork. I only have a few more questions for you. OK, fire away. - Would you mind offering a sample of your DNA? For exclusionary purposes, of course. - Of course. What have I gotta do? - Nothing. You just sit there, open your mouth, and swab the inside of your cheek. - Hey, babe? Oi, Halley? Babe? Halley? Do I have to come in there or what? I'm almost ready. - Babe? Hurry it up, would ya? Oi, Halley? I'm almost ready. Yeah, well, Elliot and Indy aren't back yet. Don't you fuckin' think they should be? They will be. What makes you so sure? 'Cause that was the plan. We were hoping you'd be more cooperative than this, Mr. Cork - Yeah, well, I'm here, aren't I? And you bastards still haven't said why. Any other bodily fluids you want? Doesn't have to be for work. Could be a take home project. - Tempting. - Okie dokie, Arthur. The witness has just arrived. You sure you don't want to get anything else off your chest? - No. - No? Nothing. Not a word. - All good? - Yep. - Done? - Yep. - OK. All right. I tried. You know the thing I love about "The Usual Suspects?" - What's that Arthur? - It's the twist, at the end. You never see it coming. I don't know what you're talking about. The big bad guy that they've been searching for, the mastermind that continues to evade them. The man, the myth, the legend that is Keyser Soze, he's been sitting right in front of them the whole time, telling them a story. They've got their man, right there. He even tells them, "Keyser doesn't exist." C'mon now. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world, he didn't exist. You are fucking deluded, you know that? - Arthur? Detective? - There's two things you have to understand. What's that? - Firstly, that's just a movie. And the second? - I've got a witness, mate.
