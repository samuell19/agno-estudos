The water's coming from there. Put some sand in. - Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor. Hurry up! - Speedy recovery! - Thank you, Doctor. Sir can you hear me? What's your name? I told you not to take me to a hospital with women doctors! People won't succeed if their chief is a woman. She's a doctor, not a chief. Don't look into my eyes! Keep her away from me! She's the only doctor here, Grandfather. Give her a chance. Can you move your right arm? - What happened? - A truck swerved to avoid a hole. It rammed us off the highway. Didn't even stop! - Drove straight off. - Keep her away from me! - Keep her away! - Get him under control. Keep her away from me! Don't look into my eyes! Calm down. Get me a male doctor! - I think his spine is okay. - Thank God! What's going on? Can't you see you're upsetting the patient? - I'm treating him. That's my job! - He doesn't want a female doctor! We'll find him some male nurses. He'll be happier with them. Dr. Ghazi, I've decided I'm taking a few days off after Eid. It'll be difficult. We'll be short-staffed. Use the male nurses you're comfortable with. They should do. Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me, sir? I can hear you clearly, go on. Okay, thank you. Mr. Tarek, we are doing our best with what we have, but some improvements are vital for our work to continue. We are the only emergency room... in the area. And the only road here is unpaved. Now a pipe has burst - and it's impossible to reach... - "Impossible"? - Sorry? - You say "impossible". Is that the right word to use, Doctor? Perhaps "difficult" would be more accurate? If it were only "difficult", sir, I wouldn't be bothering you. Doctor, we understand the challenges you face. But for now, there is no urgent justification for us to fund this project. But I promise you it will be on next year's project calendar. Dr. Tarek, if I could just... Sara! Get the door! It's still Ramadan! We should be praying, not singing. - Hello, Majid. Come in. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Wait here. My father won't be long. - Thank you. ...fill the spoon like this, then drop them into the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough, they'll lose their shape. Right, let's make some more. Use a measuring spoon to refill it... ...so they turn out well. It's much better, right? - Don't forget to beat the harees. - What? It's your turn, honey. - Hello. - Hi. How are you, Majid? - Fine, thanks. - How's your father? - He's fine. He says hi. Great. So, in our last lesson we practiced... the Bayati scale. This time, we'll be doing the Alhijaz scale. You have to pay attention to the lower tones. Use this finger and leave space in between. I can't believe how perfect you made these! Like a machine. Thanks to YouTube. They have everything in boring detail. Do you know Dr. Khalid from King Faisal Hospital? Yes. He's speaking at Dubai Medical Conference... about recruiting doctors for the new division in Riyadh. Can you register me for the conference? Damn! Registration costs 5,000 riyals! Can't you lend me the money? Just for now. The hospital should reimburse me. I'll pay you back. Selma, I'm your sister! You should support me. - I need a better job in a real hospital. - Why'd you waste your money on a new car? It was on sale! Fine, but I'm not an Islamic bank. I'm charging interest. Omar says he can cover your wedding bookings while you're away. That's nice of him. They'll be lucky to have him. He'll play and sing for them. How long will you be gone? Three weeks. - I'll leave on Eid. - Have a safe trip! Father's leaving for three weeks on Eid! Allahu Akbar... O God, I fasted for you. I break my fast with your sustenance. Do you want coffee? Give me Dad's plate. Dad, how can you leave us on Eid? Our request to perform in public... ...has finally been approved. We're going on tour. I booked you to play a wedding on the first day of Eid, and you agreed. I found a replacement. I'm not missing this opportunity. I've waited 20 years for it. I'm sick of playing parties and weddings. I want to perform for a real audience as a real artist. He should have told us! You're no better! Leaving us to go to Dubai... At least I can count on Sara to help. Like I have a choice! - Happy Eid! - You too. - What do you want? - My gift. It shouldn't be less than 100 riyals. Here's 100. Happy Eid. Where's my hug? Hi, Dad. You should have husbands to take care of these things. Yeah right, the men are lining up to marry into this noble family. Ignore her, everything will be fine. Alright, look after the house and lock the doors. May God protect you! - Happy Eid! - And a happy Eid to you. You leave the door unlocked? These are valuable instruments! Calm down! You just came in. Think I can still get a good sound out of this old bit of wood? Doubting your stellar talent? - No, never. Go on, show me! For God's sake! How can you play an out-of-tune oud? Show-off. Trying to get the Minister's attention already? - What do you mean? - You didn't hear? The guys say the Ministry's forming a national band. Ignore them. It's probably a silly rumor. Besides, you're already in a band. This one! You signed a contract with the Center. You're staying with us. Happy to be on the team, Captain! Let's pack up what we need for the concert. Excuse me? Dr. Khalid? Dr. Khalid! It's me, Dr. Maryam. From the clinic! Ah, Dr. Maryam! How are you? I'm on my way to attend your conference in Dubai. - I'm looking forward to it. - Wonderful. I hear you'll be interviewing doctors - for new positions in Riyadh. - Yes. Dr. Khalid... I'd like to put my name forward for one of those positions. If I get the chance for an interview now, I'm sure I would make the perfect candidate. Okay, I'll see what I can do about getting you on the list. Hello. Your travel permit has expired. It's there. We no longer accept paper. It has to be done electronically. It still has one month. Please, I have to get to Dubai for a conference. I'm sorry ma'am, I understand your situation. If I could, I would let you pass. But the system won't let me. Who is your guardian? My father, I'll call my father. Give me your passport, please. You can't change or cancel the ticket, sister. It must be used for the flight you selected. But they won't let me board. The airline is not responsible for your personal matters. But I paid full price. And this isn't my fault. As I said, it's not the airline's responsibility. But if you bring an updated permit before Asr prayer, I'll get you on another flight. Consider it a favor. - Okay, I'll be back. - You're welcome. Hello? Where are you? You and Dad aren't picking up. You're both ignoring me! What's going on? I'm at a wedding! What's wrong? Did you know my travel permit's expired? They won't let me fly. I can't go anywhere! Don't blame him. You know Dad has been depressed. He can't even drive since Mama died. Go easy on him. He's not the only one grieving! Calm down. Tell me what we can do about it. Remember Rashid? Mama's cousin? Isn't he in an important position now? Maybe he can help. Excuse me, where is Mr. Rashid's office? Straight ahead, then left. Number 341. But you'll have to wait, it's prayer time. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you. I would like to see Mr. Rashid. Peace be upon you. Hello? The manager can't see you. You don't even know why I'm here! He's only seeing council applicants. But there's no one here. Please, time is very tight. Today's the deadline for candidates. He can only see you if you want to apply. Fine, then I'll apply. Name? Maryam Abdulaziz al Saffan. - ID number? - 105 564... ...0525. I'll call you back. Yes, bye. Hello, sister. How can I help you? Hello, Rashid. It's me, Maryam. Badria's daughter? Doctor! It's been ages. How is your father? I hope the family is doing well. When did we last meet? Probably your last lesson with my father. Do you still play? The oud? No, no. Not anymore. - I can take that. - Thanks. Doctor, I can't believe you, of all people, want to do this! I mean, we do want women to apply. We'd love to see you on the municipal council. But a piece of advice, as your relative: It will be difficult. Especially for a young woman. You have to be careful. - Not that you aren't capable! - You've misunderstood. I'm happy to sign it. But I hope you know what you're in for. You have a fierce competitor. His name is Tarek. He's held office for three terms. He has so many projects: new car dealer lots, buildings, a mall entrance... And the road in front of the clinic? I haven't heard anything about that, no. Listen, Rashid. I'm actually here for a favor. I need your help. Have a seat! My travel permit has expired and I need to fly. Your permit to travel? Where's your father? Is he okay? He's fine. He's on tour with his band. You know him, he wouldn't stop me from traveling. I wish I could help, but it's a difficult issue. I couldn't even help my niece renew her permit without her guardian. Can't you explain the situation? - I'm sorry. I can't. - Rashid, a word? Sure. I'm truly sorry I can't help. I'll be back in two minutes. I don't have two minutes. Please, Rashid! You're my last hope! You know how much I respect your parents. I wish I could help. - Hello, Mona. - Finally, Dr. Maryam. I'm glad I got you. It's about the road... You know I'm on vacation until the end of next week. I know, but if you're still in town... We're a bit overwhelmed. I'm too far away, I can't now. The AC stopped working at the home for the elderly, so we have to take them to... Wait, wait! Bring the other patients. Hurry up, men. - Push harder! - Okay, will do. What's on the tape? My wife Badria sent it to me, a year before we met. She was a fan, and very brave to send it. I was transfixed by the beauty of her voice. God rest her soul. - Hello. - Hello. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3... Look how well Mohammed drums the beat. Excuse me. I need to check your invitation. I'm with Selma, the photographer. Got it. Okay, I said I understand. Khalid is downstairs. He just arrived. Alright. I'm going down to prepare for the start of the party. Did Rashid renew your paperwork? Didn't you go? No, I didn't. Hey, hey! Hey you, is that on? They said no pictures! I'll only film the bride. Listen, don't you dare point that camera at us. No one's filming you, calm down! - Good! Doctor! Come here. One of your father's students is backstage playing accompaniment. I have no signal. Could you talk to him? - Alright, I'm going. - Please hurry! Excuse me. Excuse me! It's you! What are you doing here? Who are you? - The doctor who treated my grandfather! - Right. The sound isn't working. I can hear her, but she can't hear me. The problem's in there. Should I burst into a room full of women? Just do something! See this wire? Check it's connected. The yellow one. Can you hear me? Make some noise, girls, the bride is coming! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah Make some noise for the bride! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! There is no God but Allah There is no God but Allah There is no God but Allah There is no God but Allah A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! A thousand prayers and peace upon you, Prophet Mohammed! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! What an audience! They were happy. Badria, God rest her soul, would have loved this. - Let's get packed up. - God rest her soul. You didn't tell me what happened. - My trip was postponed. - Did they re-book your flight? They're interviewing again in a few months. I now have time to prove to them that I'm not just any old doctor, and not some country hick. Those muddy shoes won't help your case! By the way... I'm running for the municipal council. Now I can fix the road to the clinic myself. Seriously? I thought this was over! It's like what happened with Mama, all the gossip and name-calling! This is different. I'm a doctor, not a singer. Exactly. You're a doctor. What do you know about running an electoral campaign? I don't care about the campaign, or about winning. All I care about is fixing the road to the clinic. I'll prove I can do it. They won't ignore me. I won't let it ruin my work! - Dad can talk sense into her. - Dad? He's just as nuts as she is. But what she's doing will be terrible for my business. What's that? Renew it electronically? Me? What can I say to her? You know your sister when she's made up her mind... I don't stop any of you from doing what you want. What happened? I told you Dubai was dangerous! Tell her I'll renew her permit as soon as possible. I'll call her and get her to calm down. Okay, okay. All right, bye. Those girls will be the death of me. They're determined to give me a heart attack. If they get into trouble while you're away, it's their business. Reconsidering your political future already? Here to talk me out of it? I'll leave that to Dad. Did he call you? Yes, he called. I'm not changing my mind. If Dad can't persuade you, maybe Sara will. She's convinced that... you'll ruin her life with this. And you? What do you think about it? I just think... you should cool down and really think before you rush into this. Remember what Mama used to do to calm us down? Don't. I'm not in the mood. They say you can't be close to her anymore.. Even for one day Get out of her way It's written in your destiny Leave me alone Don't blame me or give advice I have drowned deep in her sea I can no longer reach the surface What? Is my voice really that bad? It's not your voice. I'm just remembering Mama. How do I still know every word of those songs? I would get so embarrassed when Mama took me up on stage... to sing with her. I felt like a circus freak. Like all our relatives were staring at me. They were staring. You sure you're ready to be looked at like that again? No. But this isn't something stupid like singing. I just want to work in a good place. I'll show them what I'm made of and they'll give me a better position. I'm not sure that's how it works. Never mind. We have to try. - Did Abu Musa come today? - Yes. - How's his health? - He says he feels numbness in his legs. The radiographies didn't show anything. - Did you get him an MRI? - Yes. Tell me if you see anything odd. - Okay. - Thank you. Maryam! I thought you went to Dubai? - I decided to postpone that. - Ah, fine. I want you to know I'm running for Municipal Council. Is this a women's rights thing? No. There are many important issues, but the most important one is paving the road to the clinic. That's my priority. I hope I have your votes. Count me out. I don't want to get involved in these things. You have my vote, Doctor. It's about time someone fixed the road. Thank you, Mona! You're the best! Hello. Abu Musa, I'm here to discuss your health. Hello. Please don't feel obligated to deal with us, Doctor. We can wait for one of the male nurses. I understand. Unfortunately, the nurses misdiagnosed your grandfather. They were only looking at X-rays. But from his MRI, - I see he has cervical spinal stenosis. - What does that mean? There is pressure on his spinal cord He needs surgery, otherwise the pain will just get worse. I told you to leave me alone! Omar, tell her to get out of here! I'll gladly go. But I'm the only one who can help you. - I know how to read your chart... - Get out! ...and I understand the surgery you urgently need. But if you would rather risk your life I will gladly leave you in the care of a nurse who has no idea what's wrong with you. One moment. He says okay. As long as he's anesthetized before you touch him. Thank you for your trust. 10 STEPS TO RUNNING A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN They approved my application! It's official! I can't believe you're seriously doing this! - You know nothing about it! - Don't talk to me like that. I'm your older sister. To answer your question, I went online and found explanations of each step. One: "Write a platform and make a campaign video." Honestly, why did I ever doubt you? How can you fail with such a well thought-out plan? Just a second. Watch this. Hello, citizens, this is Basil Marceaux-dot-com, I'm your Republican candidate for governor of Tennessee... Is this guy for real? ...in the Capitol behind me here, so... I can... He's got over a million followers. ...do my issues. - This does not look professional. - Exactly. He's a local politician, like me. It's about getting your message out. ...the Capitol to Chattanooga, Tennessee and get rid of all the backroom politics that ruins... ...our politics... program. - The sun's in his eyes! - Shh, let's listen. I ask you all to vote for me. Pledge allegiance to the flag on the day you come to vote. You're really making something like that? - Why not? It looks easy. - People will make fun of you! I don't care. Let them laugh! Is she serious? How about this? Ugh, no. This one? That's awful. You've got no taste. I'll choose one. That's better. So presidential. This one's best. We'll stick with this. - So you'll help me? - Just a little. So it's not a total disaster. - Is my niqab okay? - No, it needs fixing. Wait. - Put your hand there. Like that. - Why? I'll use a filter to add butterflies. - Like you're releasing them. - Everyone will know it's you. Of course. It's my campaign ad, not my engagement. But they shouldn't see you! Cover your eyes. Fine, just for you, little sis. Ready? Know what you're going to say? Yes. Greetings. I'm Maryam Abdulaziz al Saffan. I am proud to announce my candidacy for the municipal council elections. Change is a big word, and the elections are the only way to have our voice in the council. I promise you all that, if I'm elected, I will pave the road leading to our local clinic. It's my dream project, and it is an issue that I'll never give up on. Vote for me, Dr. Maryam al Saffan. Help us improve... our beautiful town. I bet people will go nuts over this video. No one's going to see it. She has six or seven followers, people she knows. Most people won't know about it. But I worry about her. My daughter acts like a lion at home, but in public, she's more like a mouse... or the butterflies in her video. - You okay? - Your platform's gone viral. It's being shared and people are saying really nasty things. Whatever. It's easy to be tough online. But you know what? They wouldn't be so brave if they met me in person. Look what this woman Arwa wrote: "How long will we let women speak out in this impudent way? Shameless!" Ignore them. "So proudly showing herself off to the men. Let's see her campaign once she's been humiliated!" A lot of people want to say things in person too, so you can respond. We'll see about that. Hey, I've been researching the next step for the campaign. And? It's interesting, you know? Especially with budget planning. Your budget is zero. Don't forget you owe me for the trip to Dubai! That's why I've been studying a lot, researching fund-raising. What do you even need funds for? I haven't gotten that far yet, but there are so many ways to raise money. Go on. I'm listening. Like charity events, fundraisers... ...parties. So many ways! How about it? You put it all together and I'll let you keep 10%. Honey, 25% minimum. I'll give you 25% on one condition: We forget about the ticket to Dubai. Fine. - Sara, I need you to send out an SMS. - No way! I need both of you. Don't invite my friends or their moms. We're inviting your friends and their moms. Every woman in town! Write this down: We invite you to celebrate - the candidacy of the esteemed doctor... - Hello? Hi, Abdulla. - Esteemed? - Yes, esteemed! Just write. How are you? We invite you to celebrate this historic campaign... - Yes, we need a hall... - ...and her historic entry. ...or a room. You said "historic" twice. So fix it! Don't just watch. Maryam! Can you fill a hall for 200? Of course! Perfect. We'll take it. Okay, bye. - Ready? - The atmosphere is magical! I don't want to hear Any pleading or swearing Every lover has one mistake But you've made thousands I don't want to hear Pleading or excuses Every lover has one mistake But you've made thousands By the way, Abdulaziz, what's the news from your daughters? Don't remind me. It makes my blood pressure spike. They're planning a fundraising party now. If Badria was here she would've handled it all. You reckon? I think this would've been right up her alley. CHOOSE THE BEST BECAUSE YOU CAN - Hello, girls. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Go sell the raffle tickets. - That's gambling. Gambling? What's wrong with you? Fundraising is the most crucial part of an electoral campaign. Come on, let's get to work. I don't want any part of the campaign, or this whole stupid event. Fine. Don't get upset. But go see if the girls are ready. It's time to start. Can you help with that? Welcome everybody to the campaign party of my dear sister, Doctor Maryam. Thank you so much for coming. I hope you will enjoy the evening with us. Now we present the first part of this event, a fashion show of abayas by the designers Asma and Dania. Please give them a big welcome! The model is wearing an abaya made of crêpe Georgette and silk satin fabric. You can see how the designer Asma gave the abaya a distinctive feel with the lining and detail on the bust and the sleeves. Look at the high quality of the fabric which shows the designer's talent for combining different cloths. That shade of blue is really beautiful for winter. Here we have an innovative design by the famous designer Dania. Notice how the sleeves are trimmed in frilly organza fabric. Will the model show us those sleeves? Thanks for helping. I know you don't want to be here. You're right. I don't. - I understand. - So why put us through this? Once it's over, you'll run off to Riyadh while we deal with the gossip! You know, this isn't easy for me. I'm the one putting myself out there! That's what Mama always said, too. Please welcome our municipal council candidate, Doctor Maryam! Be sure to vote for her, and God willing she'll win the election! I can't hear you! - I'm nervous. - You can do it. Hello, every... Ah, okay. Hello, everyone. I'm glad to be with you. You all know me, and the reason I'm here today. With your help, I hope to be elected to the municipal council so I can make things better, especially at the clinic. How would you feel if something happened to your child and you couldn't do anything? Imagine for a moment: Your child has an accident and lies injured, bleeding. You jump in your car and rush to the emergency room. But as you near the clinic, you find that the road is flooded. With every step, you get more stuck in the mud. Your child calls out to you, "Mama, help me! I'm in pain!" But you are helpless. But I promise you that if I win the election my priority will be paving that road. Elect me and make sure you can tell your child, "Yes, I can help you if you get hurt!" Thank you. You were great! Hello, everyone, it's great to see you tonight at our campaign celebration. Give it up for our candidate Maryam. One more time, put your hands together for Doctor Maryam! Oh, dark one Oh, dark one You are the color of precious incense You're dark as the night Oh, dark one Darkness is the best color to my eye You shine like a star You have every right to feel so proud I've seen light and dark And the lightness of your heart is enough for me Goodbye. Goodbye, thank you. - Goodbye, thank you. - Congratulations, Doctor. Can I count on your vote? My husband would kill me, but I'll see what he says. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Can I count on your vote? - I don't vote, but thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. My phone is ringing off the hook! People loved the party! Look at this! I've booked four weddings today for this month! That's great. What? We all got what we wanted, right? It's like we were talking to ourselves. Those women didn't care. They won't vote for me. True. Maybe we should take it to the next level. The TV station called. - What is this? - What on earth? - Peace be upon you. - Hello! - How are you? - I'm fine, thanks. What's all this? Are we playing a show or going into battle? It's just a precaution. You know some radicals don't like music. Let's go inside and discuss everything. Alright then. Are you okay? Maryam... I'm proud of you for doing this. Really? Yes. I didn't expect you to have this sense of responsibility. I doubted you, but now you've convinced me. Maryam, wait! Your niqab! - Hello. Welcome. - Hi. Thank you. Stand by, guys! Three, two, one, cue! Good morning, dear viewers. Today is a new day, a new start and a new episode of your TV program Good Morning. With us today, we have Dr. Maryam Abdulaziz al Saffan. - Good morning. - Good Morning. And thank you, I'm happy to be here. We're also happy to have you with us. You're an electoral candidate? Yes, for the municipal council. Great. So, naturally... there are many issues that you, as a woman, must be particularly interested in. - Yes. As a doctor... - Gardens, for example. I'm sure you would like to see more green gardens, playgrounds. Sure, green areas are very important. But as I was saying, I'm a doctor working in the emergency room and I see how the state of the road to the clinic affects patients every day. Yes, very... interesting. So, do you think a lot of women are happy seeing you run for office? I would hope that everyone is happy to see me run. But I think it is fair to say, frankly, that your running for office matters mainly to women. No. My candidacy benefits everyone. Some topics are of particular importance to women, which I hope to discuss. But my candidacy is in everyone's interest. Yes, beautiful, well said. That's why I decided to run for office. To make a change in our community, whether it's fixing the road or changing our old-fashioned, sometimes negative mindset. What mindset do you mean? That which dismisses me as a serious candidate because of my gender. Great, great. They're cancelling the show. I can read their lips. So that was our last show? - Everyone up on the stage, please. - Yes, we're coming. Thank you all for coming. I want to discuss our concerts. As you know, some extremists don't want us playing here. And we received threats for all our upcoming concerts. I am taking those threats seriously. They are recommending we cancel the remaining shows. We don't want to upset anyone. But there are some who do want to come and enjoy the music. What are you scared of? We have an official permit. If people want to come, they come. If they don't, they don't. That's their business. I'm a musician. I came here to play. I'm going to play. Yeah, we've all been threatened before, right? Threats are nothing new. What's new is that now there is support for musicians. Well said! - So we're all on the same page, right? - Yes! Let's do this. They say you can't be close to her anymore Even for one day Get out of her way It's written in your destiny They say you can't be close to her anymore Even for one day Get out of her way... Read this message. What is it? An announcement from the Ministry about the new national band. Why didn't they talk to us? We know every musician in the Kingdom! It seems they are out searching for people now. I heard that the talent scout will be at our last show. They'll want young guys, my friend! It's too late for us. How do you know? I like to be realistic. Let's just hope for the best. Exactly, let's hope for the best! She took off her niqab? I would, but my family would kill me! Here she is, our fearless candidate! You owned the screen. Did you watch the interview? I saw it. Someone posted the highlights on WhatsApp. You were amazing! I felt so proud to be your colleague. I wanted to talk about the clinic, not just about being a woman. Even Dr. Ghazi is talking about it. Says you're showing "real initiative." What's next? I reach out to the opposition and win them over. So basically every man in town? Basically. Hey, the people's candidate! - How's the campaign trail? - Very good, thank you. Your grandfather's surgery went well. If he's lucky, if we're all lucky, he'll be able to go home very soon. Let's hope so. - The whole family's very grateful. - I'm just doing my job. Hello, Maryam. Hi, Dad. How are you? I need your help. Tell me. I want you to help me reach out to voters. Still running this crazy campaign? Now you want to involve me? Think of my blood pressure! I've checked your blood pressure a thousand times. You're fine. This time I mean it. It's killing me. I've done it all on my own so far. I need you to host an election event for men. Can you please help me with that this week? Sweetheart, I'm sorry. We just have a few more shows. It seems some guys from the Ministry may be coming to watch... This all happened because you weren't here. I need you by my side. I really need your help. You've come this far alone. You can handle the rest of it just fine. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Not that much, just a little. Omar? Who's Omar? Hiding relationships from us? He's helping me with the campaign, nothing more. Hello, Omar. Any luck? Great, I really appreciate it. Sounds good. Thank you so much for going to all this trouble. Yes, as soon as possible. Let me check the date. Selma, you booked a wedding on the 6th? Yes, so? That's election night! What could I do? It's cousin Ida's wedding! We'll turn it into a victory party. Step 9 accomplished. Omar, let's do it on the 2nd. So they won't forget my name before the big day. Alright, okay. And thank you again. Bye. Abdulaziz. There he is. Anas, from the Ministry. Remember him? He used to help organize those poetry festivals. Is he here to hear us? He won't pick any of us. You look best when you don't talk. Hey, Anas! Mohammed! How are you? - Long time no see! - It's good to see you. - Are you well? - Welcome. - Abdulaziz! How are you? - Mr. Anas. Good to see you! It's been a long time, I'm happy to see you both. - Me too. - I hope the tour has gone well. Very well, thanks to your efforts and all of your help with the paperwork. With pleasure. It's our job and you're worth it! Looking forward to the performance! And hopefully we'll be seeing more of you. - Hello! Welcome. - Thank you. Good evening to you. Hello, guys. Come on in. Good to see you. Welcome! - Good to see you! - And you! Start pouring coffee and tea, I'll be right there. - Was that your sister's driver? - My sister drives now, so I invited him. Filling this tent was not easy. Half of them look like they're here to watch soccer and the other half look like a janitors' convention. They're voters, no? Well, mostly. So, where's your father? He's busy. Looks like you're our host. - Me? You'd better give me your speech then. - Why? You can't address them directly. It's the law. No, it's not! And we have a video system. I still think it would be better coming from me. Because your irresistible charm will win me their votes? - Or your natural sense of authority? - It couldn't hurt. Let's go, Madame Candidate. It's time to begin. Peace be upon you, gentlemen. And upon you. Thank you for being here with us this evening. Please welcome our candidate for the municipal council, Maryam Abdulaziz al Saffan. Good evening and thank you for joining me here this evening. As you may know, I'm running for election to the council. Although I cannot address you directly, I want to make it clear that my issue is important to everyone. My first order of business, if elected, would be to pave the road to our clinic. The city hospitals are too far for urgent care. - If we can't get to our clinic... - Excuse me, Doctor? Please save your questions until I finish. We know you and your family. We know you're musicians. Thank you, but please let me talk. I have a song for you. Please, if I... Tell the beautiful woman with the black veil... I'm familiar with that song. Thanks for your contribution. If I may continue... We don't elect women. A woman's place is in the home. As you well know. Please, I'd like to respond. Everyone, please calm down. Wait! Please... - There's no sound! - Maybe someone pulled the cord. It must be on their side. What should we do now? Shall I call Omar? Quiet, please! Enough! I'm a candidate and candidates deserve respect, male or female! - You, the singer! Got anything to say now? - May God protect us from you. I'm not a wedding singer. Got it? I wanted to start a dialogue on an important issue. I'm from this town. If you won't support me, who will you support? We're going to pave that road in front of the clinic. It's important. Any objections? You should all want that road fixed. Thank you for listening. I hope I can count on your votes... in this historic election. Maryam! Maryam! That was a mistake. Half of them filmed the whole thing! I don't care. I'm tired of putting up with it! Let them see who they're dealing with! They warned me about getting close to you And I swear I'll never give you up They warned me so many times about you I swore I would never let you go In all my life I have no love but you You are the best Across Arabia and the Gulf My life has no love except you You are the best Across Arabia and the Gulf Your love made me give up all companions Say it with me! Your love made me give up all companions All my companions and all my friends Your love made me give up all companions All my companions and all my friends And if they gave me my weight in gold I would never trade you for someone else And if they gave me my weight in gold I would never trade you for someone else Together! God ordered me to love and adore you You, like the moon And the news has spread It's all over town God ordered me to love and adore you You, like the moon And the news has spread Let's go! It's all over town Even for my weight in gold I won't give you up Great job! Thank you! And we say together: Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop! Thank you. Good morning, dear listeners. I'm happy to share good news with you. A surprise road repair project started over the weekend and is expected to wrap up today. Construction crews were able to take on the job with only minor delays. No delays in accessing the clinic are expected. Well, you still ran a great campaign. But do you even want to win? It was all about getting the road paved, right? Yes, of course it was. See? It all worked out then. So who cares who wins next week! Quiet, please! Enough! I'm a candidate and candidates deserve respect, male or female! - You, the singer! Got anything to say now? - May God protect us from you. I'm not a wedding singer. Got it? More trouble at home? Yes, real trouble. But this time it's more complicated. I should've been there. Maybe. But then you might not have gotten this. What's this? The national band? We made it! Can you believe it? Alright, let's go pray. Okay, here we are. See you soon. Goodbye. Travel safely. You too. Hello. Where is everyone? Hello. At a wedding, working. So it's over? What do you mean? The road's paved now, right? So it's time to focus on other issues. My campaign's working. I convinced them to pave the road. Then why keep going? Because I want them to know they can't beat me. It's the first time I spoke out in public and demanded to be taken seriously. I finally feel like I'm someone... ...more than just the daughter of a wedding singer. I'm sorry. That I wasn't with you for the election. That I wasn't with you all from the beginning. Don't worry, I can handle it. You were right. I did learn one thing: how to solve my own problems. Your mother and I knew it was hard on you. This whole music business. We were always thinking about you kids. She was strong and stubborn. If she was still alive, she would be very proud of you. And very happy. You inherited her stubbornness, her strength. You might not want to hear this, but it's the truth. I see so much of her in you. How was the tour? Beautiful. Your mother would've loved it. Oh dear, why? I saw him smiling at me.. Oh dear, why? My beloved came and greeted me Oh dear, why? I saw my beloved smiling at me Oh dear, I don't know why Oh dear, I don't know why My love is growing I call for her and she hears I call for her and she hears Even if she is far away Beautiful are her eyes Dressed in the darkness of the night Beautiful are her eyes... Hi, Omar. - Thank you for helping me. - No problem, it was nothing. Listen... I wanted to be the one to tell you... I'm sorry. ...to organize the municipal council election, in all areas, and after counting 97% of the votes, we can announce that Ahmad Fahd is projected to win in his area and Sultan Mohamed has won the majority of votes in his area. We can also confirm that Tarek Al Hasan... It's not official, but... Wait, I want to see this. ...has been reelected to the local council If you had told me a year ago that I'd be running against a woman, and that it would be this close, I would have laughed. You know... You don't have to say anything. I lost. I don't need anyone to comfort me. Hello. So it's all over? It's totally rigged. I bet you got the 3 percentage points they haven't counted yet. It's okay. So what do we do now? Get back to work. What else? I'll see you at home, girls. Oh, Dana Oh, Dana Oh, Dana, Oh, Dana Oh how I worry Your love got me in trouble And exhausted me with the blame I always tell you if you love me I advise you to slow down If you love me Stay away from trouble Where's your sister, the candidate? I heard she had a nervous breakdown because she lost? She's fine! I'm sure she'll be here soon. Maryam could've at least stopped by. Ida will be so mad. I told her she would come out of this looking like a fool. We all have! Enough! You've no right to comment on this. You were no part of this, in victory or defeat. And if you go away What a joy! It wouldn't bother me at all Cover up, ladies! The groom's party is entering. A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! A thousand prayers and peace be upon you, Prophet Mohammed! Oh, how my heart swells When he comes and says hello Oh, how my heart swells When he smiles Oh, how my heart swells When he comes and says hello Oh, how my heart swells When he smiles I love him And I can't say why And I can't say why My love for him keeps growing My love for him keeps growing Oh, how my heart swells When he comes and says hello Oh, how my heart swells When he smiles I can't explain my love for him I can't say why But my love keeps growing Let me hear you! Let me hear you! That's my sister Maryam. Oh how beautiful his eyes are As dark as the night Oh how beautiful his eyes are As dark as the night Any party is meaningless If he is not there Any party is meaningless I can't explain my love for him I can't say why But my love keeps growing But my love keeps growing How's that blood pressure, Dad? Killing me. Congratulations, my dear! Congratulations. Maryam, did you see what they posted? Riyadh has ten more positions at the new hospital! Yes, I saw. Will you apply? I don't think so. There's more work to be done here. This is for you, Dr. Maryam. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'll deal with this. - Good luck! - How are you, Abu Musa? - Fine, thank you. Can I examine you? Or do I have to put you under anesthetic? - How's your arm? - It's fine. - Are you feeling any pain? - No. It looks like everything's going to be fine. - Doctor? - Yes? I gave you my vote. See my thumb? I voted for you. You are a good doctor. You saved me, I nearly died. My family would be carrying my coffin! Why didn't you get into the municipal council? You deserved it. You are an excellent doctor, the hope of the future. And you, Doctor... you deserved to win. You're right, Abu Musa. I deserved to win.
