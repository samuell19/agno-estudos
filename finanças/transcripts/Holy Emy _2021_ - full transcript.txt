Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Sister, why are you up so early? Where were you? I went to the store for milk. We were out. Your bra is hooked inside out. Faster, we're going to be late. Hey, people can see your butt. Slow down. What the fuck? - Shut up for a second sailor! - You're fucking this up. Bring the ice! You talk too much! You are here to work not chit chat. Easy, man. I'm not paying this new guy. It's not a charity here, I run a shop. Chop-chop now, alright? Okay, I get it. Next time. - Chop, chop! - Teresa... I don't like this guy. I really don't. Ma'am, what can Emy do this morning? Come here. Try again, like I showed you. Bring the van keys over here. Don't take them with you. Teresa! Come here. Do you think he's stealing fish to sell on his own? I don't think he would do that. But I'll check last week's report. I'll look after Emy. Do you know what kind of fish this is? Grouper. Teresa! Come down here, keep an eye on the shop and your sister. I'm going to Maria's. I'll be right down. Time for a break. Don't rat on me. Good morning. Are you open for business? One moment. You drive me crazy. With your tight pussy... and your slit eyes... and your round face. Tell me, what do you want? Tell me, what do you want? Can you cut three fish steaks for me? You like dirty talk? Do you? Do you have a nosebleed? Did you cut yourself? Teresa! Where are you? I didn't ask... Did you like it? It was fine. Teresa! Teresa! Where were you? Why did you leave Emy to chop the fish? I'm so sorry, ma'am, I just needed to be upstairs... I shouldn't have allowed Emy to work here. I am running a business here! I am sorry... Let me give you some fish for free. Yes, okay. Make sure her cut doesn't get infected. HOLY EMY Teresa. Happy birthday, Teresa. Don't be late. It's a special day. Take me to church with you today. What? Take me to church with you. It's a special day. Why do you even want to come? I just want to meet your new friends. You know that you can't handle it. Holy Lord is Your Name From the heavens above Blessed be the Lord's Name Sing His glory forever Holy, Holy is the Lord For he dwells in our land. "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as in the manner of some but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching." Hebrews 10:25 Now... what does this verse say to us here today? Teresa...! You come to me and say "Every Sunday I have to come to church?" But you need to understand what the Lord is asking of us. Next song. You are good, Lord All the time Every day You are always faithful when you love... I just wanted to be with you. Calm down. I told you not to come. Teresa. Teresa. Teresa. Teresa. Teresa. Mrs Chua told me what happened with Emy. - Calm down sister. - We will take care of her. Thank you for all your help, sister. What's this? I'm sorry. I'm just having my period. - It's pretty, right? - It's sexy. You're too much. Look at the back. Girls! What's going on? The sermon isn't over. We're sorry. Go back inside, and show some respect. Has Emy had her period yet? Not yet. She's like your mother. - She needs to get baptized... - Be quiet already. So the evil spirits get away from her. I don't want to. Shh. Don't be noisy. When you are done come back inside. I don't have time to bring you home. So be quiet, stop this. Sister, sister! Does it look good? It's nice. Teresa! Can I have a look? It fits you well. - Thank you. - Take care of the dress. - Yes. - Don't move around a lot. There they are. Good morning. The flowers are beautiful. This is Teresa, it's her birthday too. Happy birthday! Welcome to our church, sister. - I'll take this. - Okay, thank you. Please just put them downstairs, sisters. Hi, Linda. How are you, Emy? Fine. Did you see who is here? What is she doing here? I am sorry. I will deal with her. What are you doing here, Mrs Christina? I came to wish you happy birthday. Here, I have something for you. I'm looking for a girl again. It has been impossible for me to find someone. I'll check, Miss. Do you want the job, Emy? We already have a job, Miss. You shouldn't come here. Mrs Christina you need to leave. You are not welcome here. Go downstairs. Go down. Go on. Where are your good Christian manners? There, our debutants are so good. They are very good looking debutants. Don't they remind you guys of our youth? It reminds me of when I met my special man. Jonathan, John! Come down here, join your partner debutants, very good. What, there is no partner for Teresa? Oy boys! Who wants to dance with... Mike, come back here. Mike is single, ladies! You are single, right? What's wrong? I don't have another rose... Oooh that's fine... Come on, go ahead after all you already started something with Teresa. We don't want any complications, stay in the same couple. Maestro, sweet music, please. Do you want to cut off my split ends? Not now, I'm tired. I haven't been to Mrs Christina's house in a long time. I went there when I had to pack up Mom's stuff. It is still the same. A house of sinners. That's what Tita Linda would say. Give me the scissors. Mrs Christina wasn't good to Mom. She took advantage of Mom's kindness. Close your eyes. Her house was beautiful. Here it is, your mother's old room. Here is your mother and Luis. They were in the Philippines. Luis was a sailor at the time. Come on. Let's go in and see him. We are not done yet. Do you know who is this? Emy. Pilar's daughter. Okay, we will leave. They shouldn't have taken your mom from me. You should come again. Soon. We are calling unto you, Lord Jesus Christ for our sister Emy to be safe. Sister! Sister! Where were you? I was so worried about you. I almost went crazy from fear. Emy, you are inviting the devil into your home. What is she doing here? - I was so worried. - Let us protect you. Sister! Emy, I only called her because I was worried about you. Sister! Sister! Teresa, get her out of here! Emy, did you go to Mrs Christina? You know that place is dangerous. Get her out of here, Teresa! Your mother is a witch doctor, they just used her. They don't believe in God, they are liars! Sister... Please open the door. Is Teresa home? No, she's at work. If you need some groceries, just let me know. Are you going to get groceries after work? I don't want to go to work. I don't feel well. Fireball! Fireball! She was here, on the balcony and now she's gone. She's pregnant. - What color is she? - Grey. She is over there. That's my cat. What are you doing to her? Put her down! She's pregnant. I'll call the police! You are hurting her. I said, let her down. What is going on? What do you think? She has a soul too! Yes, yes, I'll bring your cat upstairs. Emy, give me the cat. Come on. Since your mother left for the Philippines I've felt like a mother to you here. Do you remember what happened to your mom before she left? We thought we wouldn't find her, remember? Emy. There's nothing greater than our Jesus Christ's embrace. You need to get baptized because it's the only way for the Holy Spirit to protect you. Our mother believes that there are other spirits. Listen to me, if you're in need don't be afraid to call upon Him, to ask for guidance. You can also ask me. Especially if there's something strange happening to you. Do you know how to pray? No. Why are you only calling me now? I've been waiting. I saved my dinner so we could eat together. Hello, Mom. I wanted to call you, Mom. But Teresa doesn't let me use her computer. Who cooked the food you're having? Linda made it. Why aren't you eating, my love? My body hurts and my feet hurt too. Why is God punishing me? God never liked our family. Mom, did you know... Teresa wants to tell her boyfriend that she's pregnant. Don't tell him, my child. You'll regret it. You have us. You'll not be alone. And I raised you perfectly fine without a father, right? Mom, did you know, Emy lost her job. Don't you worry. I'll figure it out. Why can't I just work at Mrs Christina's? What? Do you even know what you're talking about? Teresa what is your sister saying? Explain it to me! Nothing. I can't be the only one working while we wait for you to make a plan. By the way, Linda just said I don't want Linda anywhere near Emy! It's three in the morning!! Shut up! I am speaking to my daughters! - Go to sleep! - Look what you've done. Be sweet to her. Mom, I miss you. I miss you too, my love. Tell me again the story about when I was born. You didn't want to be born. We were on a boat ride with your father. You were three weeks late so we weren't expecting you to be born that day. Suddenly big waves came our way. After throwing up what we ate... I still remember what we had for dinner it was fish cooked in coconut cream I told your father "She's here." He still believed you were a boy. It took forty hours to get you out. Just when I thought I didn't have the strength in me I called onto the spirits and asked for their help. I said, "Please, please help my baby come out." And they did. And when I saw you I wanted to hug you. You were covered in blood that's when I knew you were just like me. You promised Mom you wouldn't tell him, this is our secret. Good morning. Good morning. Where's mine? You're late. I sold it to Valentin. Where are you going? Let it go, you asshole! Let it go you idiot, they'll kick your ass, asshole! Dude, are you Valentin? Yes, I am Valentin. This box is mine. It is my box. That box with the cross is mine! - It is mine. - Look at this asshole! - That box is mine. - Enough of this, asshole. It's mine. - What don't you understand? - Get off, it's mine. Let that jerk get beaten up. What are you doing? Stop! - Drop it. It's mine! - Give it here! Give the box here! - Let's go home. - Get out of the way. - Break it up! - Stop this crap. It's over! Fucking Albanians! Get up. - It's over! - Go back to your jobs! - Jerk! - Are you okay? I slipped on a fucking fish. Move it, let's go. I'm fine. I said, I'm fine. I'll do it. Okay, you can take care of me. That guy was very lucky. Sailor, sit in the back. Sure thing, you lovebird. Emy, come on. I told you, you asshole, to go out and do something nice you don't give a shit. To go fight an asshole, what's his name, Sal am Alaykum. And on top of that, he beat you up. Where are we? Where did you bring us? Goddamn it! You asshole! I can't take it anymore, I have to fuck. Shut up Sailor. What? We could have gone to my place! We could've stopped at a bar and picked up some pretty girls. - We have pretty girls here. - Yeah, right. What? You like this? What? You know you are a very beautiful girl. You owe me a beer. You owe me a beer. You asshole... Really? Come on, why do you get riled up? Why do you break my heart? Let me come next to you. Tell me, is he right? Tell me. Do you understand me? Play with my dick. Stop talking shit to the girls. I spent six months in the same cabin with a Filipino sailor, Miguel. I know a great deal about their women at first they play hard to get - Stop it. - And then they give it all in bed! Quit it man. These girls aren't like the ones you know. What's wrong? What is it? - I'm gonna tell you something. - What is it? Teresa, don't tell him. I'm pregnant. What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Let him go! Fuck, let go of my fucking hand! I said, stop it! Fucking Christ! She fucking bit me! Did you listen, you fuck? I'm gonna be a father. Well done, you asshole. Now, start the car so we can leave. Well done dude! Teresa! What? What do you want to do? I'll give you the money. I don't want you to worry. It's not a big deal. Teresa, let's go to bed. Just tell me, how happy are you right now? And don't you tell Linda either. Don't touch me! Why don't you let me touch it? It's mine, not yours. I want to work at Mrs Christina's. Go on, do what you want. You're on your own. You did good with the salad. Ismini is showing good signs of improvement. Right, Luis? We are eating. Come on. I forgot our pills, excuse me. Don't pay attention to him. He has become grumpy over the years. Do you know how to bake? - No. - It's okay. I have them delivered from a very good pastry shop nearby. I like sweets too. A diabetic like me shouldn't eat sweets, nor smoke. He's right. Go pick it up. Hello? Not sleeping yet? Who is it? It's Teresa. We are still eating. Mrs Christina doesn't like to eat early, it makes her sad. How are you? I miss the TV. The TV misses you too. What time are you coming on your day off? Do you want to come to the Doctor with me? Really? Or we can meet at home? All I'm asking is let her help you. Let me go, madam. - Are you jealous? - Sure. I don't want you to worry. Emy. I didn't introduce you. This is Emy. Pilar's daughter. Beautiful girl. She is a pure soul. Go upstairs. Why? Luis asked for me? Go upstairs I tell you. Come in. Okay, my boy? Everything's fine. I'll leave you now. Okay? Go away. Luis, they need you upstairs. Aggelos, don't we look lovely today. This is Emy. She will be helping me. Emy, help Aggelos get on the table. Feet here, head there. Straighten his legs. You need to be careful, Emy. I know you're attracted to healing. Your hands are strong. People here will appreciate. You need to be ready and humble to receive their admiration. Do you trust me? You should trust me. Let me protect you. Christina only sees her own needs. What did she do to my mom? A healer shouldn't accept money for their gift. But Christina took advantage of it and Pilar got punished. Is this how you were with my mom? Did you know I was the one who persuaded your mom to come here? She let me assist her in what she did and I would protect her. Why do you keep these? I help things take their course. I can't change their course. I don't have the ability like Pilar. There is nothing more humbling than a body that doesn't live up to your desires. What are we if not our own bodies? I will ask for a few extra lab tests. To relieve your stress. Okay, Teresa? I still can't eat anything. Are you resting like I told you to? - Let me touch it. - Don't. Why don't you ever let me? It's asleep. Let me. Emy, if I say no, it's a no. Do you have pains? Yes. What are you feeling? Most of the time I'm tired. And my hair is falling out. I feel like someone is stabbing me in the back. I got spirit in my head that is keeping me alive Keeping me alive, keeping me alive I got spirit in my head that is keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive. It might be an aswang. You shouldn't have Emy around while you're pregnant. My cousin lost her baby due to a tiktik that was visiting her every night. I got spirit in my hands that is keeping me alive Keeping me alive, keeping me alive I got spirit in my hands that is keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive. Can you get up? Are you sure? I got spirit in my hips that is keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive. I got spirit in my knees that is keeping me alive Keeping me alive, keeping me alive I got spirit in my knees that is keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive. Emy, let's go home. Emy doesn't want to leave yet. - In a little bit. - Come on, let's go home. Keeping me alive, keeping me alive Let's go, Emy! I've got spirit in my body that is keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive. Ismini, I'll be right outside if you need me. Don't feel bad. Everybody has seen them. - Where is it? - Here. Do you feel that? I feel it too. Don't laugh. It hurts. It hurts a bit. Is everything okay? Yes, go away. Stop talking, I know what I am doing. Thank you. Thank you very much. I can't breathe. Give me my blanket. I can't move my fingers today. Fix my hair a bit. I'm sorry for asking. Take care. What's the matter? Nothing. Ismini, can I borrow your phone? Yeah of course. Sister Rosa, can I speak to Mom, it's Emy. Do you know what time it is? Why are you calling so late? I need to speak to her. Where are you calling from? Where is Teresa? Ismini. - All good? - Yeah. Any unclaimed vehicle will be thrown overboard. Mrs Panagopoulou, please take your dog cause it's busting our balls! Try it. I'm the junk dealer! Yo! Come over here a sec. I know this guy. Nice pickup line! You're full of tar. Give me a piece of gum. What's going on with your friend? Emy! What are you doing? Get out of there! There's tar and dead fish in there! Emy! - Argyris! - What? Hold on. Not now. She sent you? Answer, your sister sent you? Come with me, come. Girls, it was my pleasure. Here, drink. Careful, don't knock her up too. Stop it, you asshole! That's enough. You won't bite tonight, okay? Pour me another one. Drink up, it's good for you. You don't know how to order, you moron. She can't drink this. Listen. Can you leave us alone... - What your sister did was not cool. - Can you leave us alone? Not cool. Because he's a good guy. Am I wrong? This cunt your sister did it on purpose. Do you hear me? On purpose. She thinks you're a sucker. You let a cunt boss you around and that fucks me too! Stop it, you asshole! What does this have to do with you? I want water. - What are you doing here? - Stop shouting. I am here. - Why did you bring him here? - I want water. Are you drunk? I'm sorry, but I'm here. I'm here! How are we doing? - I am falling asleep. - What do you want? Let me sleep here with you. Come over here. - I also want the TV. - Sure. You're too drunk to sleep, eh? You need to drink some water. What happened to you? Teresa! Teresa come here! What's wrong? Are you hurt? Let me take a look at you. Do you want to go to the hospital? Teresa! Bring my pants. She is hurt, we need to go to the hospital. - Quiet. - She is hurt. - It's okay. - What? - Don't be loud. - She is hurt. What is it? Eh? It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. What the fuck is happening? Is she crying blood? I have to show it to Akis. - I have to show it to Akis. - Emy, it's okay... It's not a big deal. It happens to some people in the Philippines. It's no big deal. - It's nothing! - What are you telling me? What do you mean "it's nothing"? I don't understand! Teresa, is everything okay? It's okay. It's nothing. Shh! Everything's okay. Are you sure? I can hear somebody in there. It was just a bad dream. Go back to sleep, Tita Linda. He is dreaming. Are you better? I think so. We'll go to the doctor with Argyris. Do you want to come with us? He probably got stuck at work. Are you okay? Someone should warn the women. Emy, can you stay with me one more day? Don't. I feel like I haven't eaten in months. Didn't we have a doctor's appointment today? I brought you a gift. The new boss doesn't pay much attention. I'll return the cooler tomorrow. No harm, no foul. I'll make dinner. - Do you want help? - No. Emy, stay for dinner! I'll invite Linda. Has this ever happened to you before? Why? I'm talking about the tears. Can you do it again? I've never seen anything like it. Is that why you're here? No, I just Googled it. Look, me and Akis have an idea. You have no idea how many people will want to see it. It will benefit everyone. Your sister, the baby... Teresa! I'm hungry. What can I do to help you do it again? Nothing. Think about it. He doesn't want this baby. - What did you do? - Nothing. Give me that roasting pan. That's not why he is here. Teresa. Look for what you need. Whatever you don't need we can give to the church. These ones are still in good condition. Thank you. Emy, how are you? Tita Linda, now that I remembered do you still have the baby's crib? I was thinking of making this the baby's room. So, Linda Amen. Yes? Have you known the girls for a long time? Since I came to Greece. Linda is like a mother to us. No, she's not. So, do you go to church? Yes. You can come with us if you want. Are there a lot of girls like Emy? Emy is quite unique. I told Akis to come. He's my cousin, Akis. He can have dinner with us too. Where will he sit? Come on, you shit. - Where were you? - I brought beers. What's the deal? - Why are we sitting down like savages? - Get in. Hi, nice to meet you. Akis, I'll bring you a plate. We were just talking about how unique Emy is. Linda is the girls' mom, almost. Stop talking about me. Be careful with the bones. So, Akis, do you also work at the fish market? I'm kind of an entrepreneur. We're thinking about starting a new business. What's wrong, man? Argyris? - Water, water! Quick! - Water, man. - Teresa, do you have bread? - Argyris! - Water, water! - Drink some water! Teresa do you have any bread? Argyris! Argyris! - Argyris, spit it out! - Emy, stop it! Emy! Was that what you wanted? Emy, don't do this to him. Emy! I told you, he did not come here for the baby. Look who is here! - We are late. - Don't worry about it. - What a joyful day. - Of course. Move it girls. Thank you for having us. Cleo recommended you. - Ah nice. - Thank you. Bring me that package. - Madam, I'm going out tonight. - Why? Ismini asked me to. That's a joke. What do you two have in common? You must focus on what we're doing here. This is for you. I got your size. The same medical blouse as your mother's. You will wear it today. I'll be the first one you'll treat. I thought today was a party. Come fix my zipper. It's stuck. You must help me. That's why you're here. Not only to take and take. Look at my legs. They're filled with sores. I can't do it again today. I'm so good to you. I brought you here, I taught you what you can do. Not Teresa, not Luis. I did it. Why are you treating me this way? Take off my shoes. Thank you. We are very lucky to have her with us. She is lucky to have us. We all need someone to notice us to pay attention to us. If it weren't for us, Emy wouldn't be what she is. So, Emy doesn't have a will of her own? I've never had such a big party thrown for me. Luis, Teresa says that both God and the Devil can heal. I say that neither God nor the Devil exist. Only we exist. Emy! - Very beautiful. - Pretty girl. I hope she doesn't end up like her mother. What do you mean? Pilar was diagnosed bipolar. Oh my God! Very sad. Terrible. I heard that she ran outside naked like a maniac believing that she was the Messiah, shouting nonsense like that. That's awful. - Do you think it's hereditary? - I hope not. Bravo... To Emy! They're looking for you upstairs. I got bored. Fuck off! So are we going for a walk afterwards? You don't want to? I'm going upstairs. Sister. What are you doing here? It's quite a party. Why are you here? Emy, come with me, let's go home. Isn't this what you wanted? Emy, come with me. Emy. Now? Yes, now. Teresa, why are we here? We won't be long. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art Thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of death. Amen. I want to go. Teresa, are you still in pain? Emy, you have to do this for your sister. Bless us, use us, cover us with Your Holy Spirit, please purify me Lord, mold me, fill me with yourself, use me, Holy spirit banish all the forces of evil from me, destroy them, vanquish them so that I be healthy and do good deeds. Amen. Emy, accept the Lord. Say Amen. Emy, say Amen. Do this for me. Do it for my child. I do everything for you. Why are you doing this to me? Please continue, go on. Emy, do you deny the devil and all evil spirits? Emy, answer! Emy! Yes she does. - Brother. - Emy say the words! Go ahead, brother. Emy, blow them away! Praise the Lord. Renounce them. Let them leave your body. Sister, blow them away! Let them leave your body. Emy, blow it out. Blow it out. Let it get out of your body. It's not the devil. I need them to go away. Do it for your sister, Emy. Do it to me. Help my baby. Please, Linda, me too. I'm begging you, save my child. Sister, I beg you. Teresa! Teresa! Please. I want to get rid of all the bad spirits in me. I am not the devil. Help me! - Help me, I'm begging you. - Teresa! Please, continue, go on. I'm begging you, Linda. - We need to go to the hospital, Teresa! - Come on, Teresa. - Brother. - We need to go to the hospital, Teresa. Teresa, you need to get out of there. We have to go to the hospital. Careful. Step. Take a deep breath. Push. Breathe. - You're doing very well. - Push hard. Well done. It's a boy. Let me see him. Calm down. Give her a sedative to calm down. - What do we do with the baby? - Prepare for resuscitation, quick! - Should I give oxygen? - Immediately! Come with me. I'm giving oxygen now. It still hurts a lot. What is going on? Is he alright? Everybody, come help with the baby! It hurts a lot. Stiches. Why is he not crying? Calm down. What's going on? Is he okay? Don't do this to me. Please, go outside! It's different in my dreams. You have to give him to me now. Come on. What are you doing? - What is she doing? Stop her! - Give me the baby! - Give me the baby! Take it easy. - What's going on? Take it from her! Doctor! Doctor! Please, calm down. Everything is alright. I won't do anything. Just give me the baby. You didn't want to be with us? It's not your choice to make. Stop. It's ticklish. Thank you, Emy, thank you. Thank you, God.
