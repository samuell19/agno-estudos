[Aya Matsuura smash hit single] [Great songs, great face, great personality! The idol trifecta!] Erm... Yes? Come to this, if you like. We hold a Hello! Project event every month. Thank you. Thanks. [Hello! Project Abeno Branch] [28 February 2004] Nishino, all you ever talk about is Hello! Project. So what? What will you do if it ends? I'll talk about my memories of Hello! Project! We've been discussing who was the MVP of the last concert. How about you, Ito? The 6th generation members, especially Reina Tanaka's singing has improved. When she shouts, it sounds like Shinya Oe. You're just saying that because you're a fan of his. Apart from Nacchi, who's graduated, I think Matsuura is doing well. Going solo, I think she might eclipse Morning Musume. I see. Nakauchi, how about you? I think Michishige's singing was good. But it was just a moment! Her only lyric was "Soap bubble!" But she said "I'm the cutest" very clearly in her cute voice, and I think she's the cutest. "If a single came out with Michishige and Konno on main vocals, I'm sure it'd be a massive hit. Talking of cute voices, while riding a bicycle, I was listening to Rikai Shite > Onna no Ko. I got so into the song, I went through a red light and nearly got hit by a car! If you'd been hit, they'd rush over and hear that song from your earphones! Yeah, as a man, it'd be the ultimate way to die! Today's talk was so funny! Thank you. Excuse me. This event was so much fun. Thank you. Thanks for the flyer. Oh, the other day. You like Hello! Project too? Yes. Who's your favorite? Favorite? You like Ayaya? I love her. You too? Of course. He always says that. That's amazing. You made it yourself? Great, isn't it? Mostly all my own work. No it ain't. I'm the one who made it. - Nishino. - What? How much did Kinko's charge? 20,000, right? Not that much. You said it cost two goes in a blowjob bar. It was 7000 including shipping. How much do you pay each time? 3500. In a blowjob bar? Yeah, a blowjob bar. Wanna tag along? To the after-party. After-party? Is that alright? Thank you! Thank you! I'm going on ahead. Six of us, right? I'll check if they have seats. Are you a student? You work? I have a job. I don't know what job you do, but it's normal to say your name. My name? It's Tsurugi. They call me Kozumin. Kozumin? My real name's Koizumi. Koizumi? Nice to meet you. Why didn't you introduce yourself? Robi asked you if you like Ayaya. Nakauchi invited you to the after-party. Why didn't you say your name? That unemployed bunch might not mind, but to someone who works, that's way too rude! Kozumin. Can six of us get in? This guy called Tsurugi is gonna go check! Yes. Why are you bullying him? He offered to do it! So what? That's no way to treat a guest of our event. Aren't you a keyboard warrior? Yes, I am. So don't bully people offline as well. It's full, so I'll check another place. No, there's a shithole we can go to. Don't call my apartment a shithole! Let's go to the shithole. Stop saying that! Tsurugi, you're a bassist? That's so cool! Really? I'm not cool at all. You must get lots of girls at gigs. My band isn't popular at all. I do my day job every day. Yeah, but when you're tired after a hard day's work, even if you're alone at home, watching Ayaya lifts your spirits. You too, Nishino? Yeah, but I prefer Gocchin. Makes it all worthwhile. I couldn't agree more! I know! Tsurugi, you don't want to end up like him. Have something else aside from Hello! Project. But what else is there? You have a guest! Why did you take a bath? It's my apartment. I can do as I please. How come? Why are you shouting? What's up? I weigh only 50 kilos. How come? Must be one of Robi's pranks. Ito, I finished making this. Really? - So funny! - Looks just like you! Yeah, I'm the culprit. What's that? A serial strangler's wanted poster. Tsurugi, I've brought Ayaya's DVD. Let's watch it together. Robi, have you messed with my scales? No. It must just be broken. But I've put brassieres in your washing machine. Why do you always do such meaningless pranks? Tsurugi, if you want anything, just take it. Huh? But... It's all yours. A hand towel. Hey, what are you doing? - Can I really have all this? - Of course not! - You don't need it. - Don't be so mean. No, I need it! Stop it. Don't do that. You want something? No, but everyone just... You can have Ayaya's poster. I have two of them. - Really? - I only need one. But that's all. Thank you! May I open it? Hey, don't steal my porn! Stop it. What's with that look? - I ain't stealing it! - Yes you are! No I'm not! - Why do you look angry? - What's with that? Let go of my porn! - What the hell is that? - Stop looking! - What are you doing? - Stop looking! Stop... Ow! Ow! What are you doing? Violence is... This is how I met these other men captivated by idols. It was so much fun, like I was an adolescent again. [Broken, I'm told.] [Broken, I'm told.] Tsuru! Hi, Yasuko. Long time no see. Yeah, long time. Hello. Are there any weirdos? Don't be so worried. They're all friends of Tsurugi. I'll introduce you later. Let's go in. [Hello! Project Abeno Branch Summer Campaign!] I thought W might eclipse Morning Musume. They only sang covers, so I wasn't so sure, but Aa ii na! was fantastic! All songs Hideyuki "Daichi" Suzuki arranges are great. Shie, wanna sit down in the front row? No, here is fine. Really? Robi, you came into my place singing that song. With only men there, it stunk so bad! That was all Ito's fault. He smells like fermented carp! Tsurugi, what are you doing there? Come up here. Have fun. Here's Tsurugi. Ayaya's been appearing on Saturday's drama series, and she's fantastic in it. Some say she can't act, and just plays herself, whatever the role is. I can't accept that at all. As a star, it's natural that she plays herself. Just write the role to fit her. Scriptwriters should write roles for her. She shouldn't have to change herself to fit the role. She's a star, not a chameleon, right? That's right. And that's why... Those two girls who were here. You know them? They study at my university. Didn't they want to sit down? Why didn't you let them sit? He's angry you sent them away. But I didn't send them away. They came to talk about the campus festival. What about it? They want us to appear at their Hello! Project event. And... what did you say to their fantastic offer? I said it wasn't up to me, so I'd ask you all. Why do you need to ask us? You should've said yes straight away! Maybe they're still outside. You're unbelievable! Sorry. How can you stay so calm? What? Are you excited? It's our big chance! I don't get it. A chance to do what? Raise awareness about Hello! Project. [Campus Festival Special Event] Thanks. Don't do that! And so, led by Nishino, we appeared at the campus festival. I'm looking forward to this. I have a bad feeling about this. You can't let them appear before university students. Why? That asshole is talking about raising awareness and stuff, but they're just a bunch of unemployed geezers. No money in the bank, no girlfriends. All they know about is idols. No redeeming features. I know it's a festival, but it's no place for the likes of them. Morning. Morning. They're college girls. You're gonna let a criminal like Ito loose among them? No, which one? Koizumi, don't say stuff like that. They want someone to talk about Hello! Project. Who better for the job? I feel sorry for Nishino. Look how excited he is. Going back to the Hello! Project timeline... [Hello! Project Abeno Branch Special Lecture] By the way, this stick is... the antenna I ripped off my radio this morning. I did that because Hello! Project means so much to me! Don't talk about that. Why shouldn't I? In January 2004, members of Hello! Project Kids formed Berryz Kobo. They're still in grade school, but Anata Nashi Dewa Ikite Yukenai is so raw! Having such young kids sing such a mature song, the contrast with their childlike voices is so musical and experimental. Tsunku really is a genius. Please watch that song's video when you get home. They're so cute! It's so cool! Shimihamu is so tiny! So cute! Just like a hamster! A man up to his eyeballs in debt from paying to get sucked off. A horny pervert who rents 30 adult videos a week. You can't let him talk about Berryz Kobo. - What? - I didn't say anything. You were talking about my debts. He's such a moron. No we weren't. You were! They'd already left. Team meeting. Even Kozumin, who talked trash about all the others... You know, in my opinion, everyone, including all of you, would say Fujimoto looks fantastic. You might think... people would listen to Morning Musume because they like the way she looks, but most people never go that far! They have a lack of intellectual curiosity! Shie, do you know these guys? You invited them, didn't you? No, Yasuko did. She said it'd be alright. This'll hype everyone up! Let's play it at the end. But only fans will get hyped up. You think ordinary students will too? No way! For real? Don't run away! Hey, don't run away! Girls these days only look at idols superficially! They're prejudiced against us idol geeks! Sorry! Excuse me! Yasuko, let me explain! Please. Saeki, you came! I'll introduce you. No, don't bother. I never thought you'd get so obsessed with idols. You're the one who showed me how fantastic they are. Nah. Come on, I'll... Is Shie alright? Yeah. Sorry, I guess this isn't what you expected, is it? Are Ayaya's concerts always as lively as this? Of course. Why do you ask? There's one next week. An Ayacon. Ayacon? An Ayaya concert. I wanna go to an Ayacon. A special bento, please. Coming up. No way! It's true. She said straight up she wants to go. Whatever. Even so, the tickets are all sold out. Actually, I'd planned to go with someone, so I bought two. You make me sick. Come on, pay up. Thank you. How much is it? 2531 yen. I have no small change. Is 2500 alright? 2600. 3000, and give me change. I have no small change, so I'll take 3000. No! You're going to an Ayacon with a girl thanks to me. Look, I made an ass of myself to make you look good. [Monami Aida DVD Launch Event Handshake Ticket] Thank you. You're so sexy. Thanks. I'll take a photo. Say cheese. I'm a big fan! Thank you. - A "W". - A "W"? Here goes. - Thank you! - Thanks. I always watch you, and... I heard you were coming, so I came. I heard that you'd be here, so I'm here too. Thanks, you're so cute. Are you nervous? Hurry up and stand next to her. I'll take a photo. You're too stiff. Bunny ears peace signs. You look so stiff! This is the worst! Bye. Thanks. I bought you this bento. Please eat it later. I'm sorry, we can't accept food. But it's delicious. I buy it regularly. It's not a matter of how it tastes. He's being refused! Stop it. What are you doing? It isn't about that. I don't mind. You bought it for me, didn't you? Thank you. I'll eat it later. Thanks. I buy it regularly. It's really delicious. Is it? Thank you. That gives me a warm glow. Monami's so kind, isn't she? But you were so nervous... You forgot to say "I'm a big fan!" You're so rude! Don't say that. I'm depressed now. It if were Matsuura, you'd die of nerves. I wouldn't want to do that to her. Hey, Tsurugi. Take a photo of us. When did he get here? He's here. You're late! Sorry. Where were you? Sorry. Where were you? I was asleep. Asleep? How dare you sleep and keep us waiting? I was jerking off. Jerking off? No wonder you smell of squid. No I don't! There's no way you can smell it. Tsurugi, is there anyone you know about our age who says... "Those were the days" even though they're young? Yeah, they miss their student days. They think that's the peak of their lives? The older I get, the more fun I have. I'm having the best time in my life. As we progress through school and university, each graduation brings farewells and new encounters. But once you're an adult, there are no more graduations. It tastes awful! Awful! Urgh! Robi, your farts really stink! Yeah! - Smell it! - That stinks! Being with them, like eternal junior high schoolers, I suddenly wished this time would last forever. That's a relief! 65 kilos. Why do you care about your weight? Good health is important, you know? What's your weight? 59 kilos. I'm healthy. Too light! - What? - What? No way! What's up? Damn! Her stomach must be really killing her! She's probably lying. [Sorry, I have a stomach ache, so I can't go tomorrow. From Yasuko] What's wrong? [Aya Matsuura] What a shame. You bought two tickets. If only that pretty girl had come. Erm, excuse me. What is it, Tsurugi? Who are you? Me? I'm you in 20 years time. Hey, what are you doing? Don't worry about it. I'm not worried. What is this? You're fine the way you are. Following the idols you love with great buddies. Girlfriend? Don't need one. Money? Who needs it? All you need is Ayaya. Right? Forget about wanting to be a musician. Look at me, you in 20 years. See? I'm having so much fun. Just stay the way you are, forever. Then you'll always be happy. Watcha doing? I've made stew. Don't keep looking at it. It ain't my fault. Looks tasty. Smells great. No way! No way! [Fanclub Exclusive Aya Matsuura Handshake Event] Is it OK if I go? You have to. Your happiness is all thanks to her. It'd be rude not to go. You're right. I've had so much fun thanks to Ayaya. I'm so embarrassed that I ripped her poster! - Your dithering is more embarrassing. - I'll die of embarrassment! OK, I'll go in your place. No. Look Ayaya in the eyes, and say "Thank you for everything". Eat. Thank you. Why are you crying? Is it that delicious? No. It tastes grainy. No way! Huh? You're right. But why? How come? What is this? No way! It's grainy. Yeah, grainy. Really grainy. What did you put in it? You know, I just followed the instructions. How come? What is this? Go ahead. [Aya Matsuura Handshake Event] Go ahead. Please wait here. - Keep doing your best! - I will! Thank you! Thanks. Go ahead. Hello! Ayaya's looking at me. Me, a lowlife who isn't worth looking at. Ayaya's looking at me. She's looking at me. She's looking at me. I always watch you, listen to you. I'm a big fan. I love you. I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan. Keep doing your best. Thank you. I hope you'll always be my fan. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. I became able to stop running away all the time... Thanks to Ayaya. [Sketch of serial strangler suspect] The police have messed up and arrested the wrong guy! Looks nothing like him, except for the glasses. The culprit's right here. Shall I call them? I was working every night, and hardly went home, but I spent weekends with the guys, and the idols we loved. It wasn't so bad. This is Aaru. Never met him, have you? Nice to meet you. I'm Aaru. Aaru? You like Mikitty? - You too? - Of course. He always says that. Take a seat. Aaru, what do like about Mikitty? But in my heart, I also felt I was lacking something. I'd been running away from my dream of making a living as a musician. Let's start a band. A band? You know, at the events we do, we could have the main thing as music. Just a thought. Hi! Where did you spring from? I came in with the music. I'm lida from Renai Kenkyukai. We could call ourselves "Renai Kenkyukai"! Why that name? Alright, shall we make T-shirts? I can play drums, you know? Really? Can I join? I play guitar. Oh yeah, you do. What about us? What can we play? Alright, alright. I'll be on vocals. Thanks for coming. Thank you. It was fun. We thought about not doing Hello! Project covers, but just rap about whatever we were thinking. But then it'd just become a mess, and this was our first gig, so... Well, good luck. Hi, Tsurugi. Saeki? That was a great gig. - You were here? - Yeah. No you weren't. You've obviously just arrived. We'll definitely come to your next gig, won't we? We're gonna support you all the way, so good luck. Shall we go? Thanks for introducing me to Saeki. See you. Tsurugi. Allow me to introduce you. This is Nao, my girlfriend. Nice to meet you. I'm Nao. I'm Tsurugi. Nice to meet you. Your girlfriend came, didn't she? No. I guess they broke up. What? What's that for? Wanna come to the after-party? No, I'm... What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. He's stalking me. Who's stalking you? It ain't your business. How can you say that? Nao, if you need our help, you just have to ask. I'll kill him. Where is that stalker? He's in that car. He's in there. I can see that. - Shall I call him? - No. We'll just look at him. Aren't you gonna kill him? But he's got a car! - What does that matter? - Shall we walk past him, then? Let's see his face. No! Please don't! - Don't antagonize him. - For real? It'll just make it worse. You should go over there! Shut up, you keyboard warrior. Keyboard warriors are tough only on the internet. This is real life! And he has a car! Now he's angry. Koizumi, why are you holding her hand? Oh, I am! Why is that? What are you doing? I don't know! Koizumi, it's fine. You can let go. Nao, if you get scared, just tell me. She ain't gonna tell you anything, so let go! Who do you think you're talking to? I'm just telling you to let go! Let go of her! What are you doing? Don't fuck with me! I ain't fucking with you! Shut up, you little shrimp! What? - Little shrimp! - I heard you! If you heard me, then say! Say what? Say something! I asked who you think you're talking to. To you, you little shrimp! The next day, we began being attacked by him. [Renai Kenkyukai needs to die.] [Die, you tedious geeky shits.] I'm "just sunglasses"? He's calling me a "Creepy Geek". But that's the truth. He's calling Nakauchi and Koizumi "Beard Dick" and "Gorilla Dick". Read what he's calling you. "Freaky pervert". At first, he just called us names. But then it escalated, [Once I call my sister, it's over for you fucks.] and his sister got involved too. [I'll make you beg for forgiveness on your hands and knees.] This is going nowhere. Let's just apologize. No other choice. You stirred it up. Yeah. We decided to apologize to get him off our backs. But the keyboard warrior raised an objection. You stirred it up, Nishino. Let's all go and apologize. In your dreams! Why should we apologize when we've done nothing wrong? I'm gonna refute them! And our worst fears were realized. [You and your sister are both half-wits.] [You're so stupid, I can't even understand what you want.] Kozumin rebutted them furiously. [Moron, you write too much. Drink poison and die.] But it had no effect on them. Finally, they ended up going to apologize face to face. We realize we were in the wrong too, so we're here to apologize properly. I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. Your voice is no louder than a mosquito. You're the one who said you wanted to apologize. I am apologizing. Don't take that tone with me! Get on your knees. On your knees! I'm really very sorry. I can't hear you. Say it louder. I'm really very sorry! I have no idea how humiliating it was... for someone as proud as Kozumin. I might move to Tokyo in the new year. Tokyo? A friend of mine works at a music venue. He's quitting, and asked me to take his place. A music venue, huh? Are you gonna stay in Osaka? I haven't really thought about it. I see. I'm gonna kill 'em. Koizumi, you know... - Just let it go. - Why? I was on my knees, and you laughed at me! Nakauchi wasn't there. Who fought with them on your behalf, huh? You did, because nobody else was stupid enough to! We could've ignored them, but you said "I'll refute them!". You're surprised we laughed at you? We tried to stop you, but you went. Of course we're gonna laugh. Be grateful that's all it was! That's enough, Tsurugi. What's with that Aaru, anyway? He's a nasty piece of work. I can't stand him. I'll show him what's what. Nao'll be done for if she stays with him! He's angry at Aaru now? Let's not interfere. Soon after that, Nakauchi left for Tokyo. Kozumin's rage didn't let up for a second. Look, you shouldn't be such a doormat. You're a nice girl. Well, Aaru's a nice guy, too. But you don't suit each other. Koizumi... What!? [Ito] How did that happen? Ever since that time, Nao's been coming to me for advice, so I told her... Aaru's no good, and she should leave him before she gets hurt even more. And you know what? She lapped up everything I said. I guess she's old enough to appreciate a more mature guy. And then things got kinda intimate. No way! It's true. How far did you go? I groped her tits through her clothes. Are you different to Aaru? Of course. Really? I'm completely different. Anyway, Nao's gonna be mine. No doubt about it. Aaru's lost, and I've won. Koizumi, what do you mean you've won? What do I mean? Those two are finished, and Nao's gonna be mine. That means I've won. What? You've won? Yeah, I've won. Listen. Aaru and Nao are finished. I'm gonna have sex with her next time. My pants got crusty from the precum when I groped her tits. For real? For real? What is that? Great, isn't it? Took some time to put on. Shall we go? It's shameful! - I ain't riding this. - Too conspicuous. Come on, get in already! - Get in! - No way! Why? It's shameful! [Rika Ishikawa, congratulations on your graduation!] [If we only live once, I wanna die with Rika Ishikawa.] Right, this is very sudden, but... Morning Musume have an important announcement. Two members are going to announce it to all you listeners. And here they are. This is Rika Ishikawa. Next year, at the end of Morning Musume's spring tour, I'm going to graduate from the group. And so the graduation... I still can't accept it. Rika-chan, say it ain't so! [Morning Musume Concert Tour 2005 Spring] Let's go for it! Tsurugi! Nakauchi! Where's everyone else? Already inside. I'm waiting for the person I bought a ticket from online. I see. You live close enough to come here by bike, huh? I envy you! You should move to Tokyo too. Lots of chances for musicians here. Yeah, you're right. Nice bike you've got there. May I? So light! Erm... Erm, are you Mr. Tsurugi? Are you Ms. Baba? Thanks for bidding. Here's your ticket. Thank you. Rika-chan! Rika-chan! Thank you very much. 7 May 2005. Today I graduate from Morning Musume. Rika Ishikawa, 20 years old! I don't like writing, but today, I've written my thoughts in a letter to you all. Dear my darling Everyone, Exactly 5 years ago, I joined Morning Musume as a 4th generation member. Rika-chan! Thank your very much for today. Thank you. Having you by my side was so much fun, Tsurugi-kun. Me too. Graduations are sad, aren't they, Tsurugi-kun? I was so moved by hers. Are you OK? I'm so sorry! I've been calling you Tsurugi-kun, haven't I? I'm a high school teacher, so... when I'm with young people, I can't help addressing them like children. Oh, I see. You're a teacher, Ms. Baba? That's why I'm moved by graduations. I'm sorry. Getting so emotional at my age. No, it's fine. It was a great graduation ceremony, wasn't it? A great graduation ceremony. OK, see you. See you. 7 May 2005. Today I graduate from Morning Musume. Rika Ishikawa, 20 years old! Yeah, I've won. Listen. Aaru and Nao are finished. I'm gonna have sex with her next time. This is bad. Yeah, I've won. Listen. Aaru and Nao are finished. I'm gonna have sex with her next time. Quit it, already! It's making me cry too! It's unforgivable! It ain't about winning and losing. We're all on your side. Just suck it up. Stop crying. The trial of Tsurugi, the show-off who thinks he's so popular! In deposition 1, Motako Ishii of Oshiripenpenz states: Tsurugi gave his autograph to a female fan on the street the other day. A clear case of showing off! No, I only did it because she asked me to, that's all. It says here she was cute. Yeah, a face like a Hello! Project girl. And all you gave her was your autograph? Of course. - Her number? - No. Of course not. We'd just met on the street. The girl with the face of a Hello! Project girl... and Tsurugi exchanged messages via Mixi. I have a printout. Hey, how did you get hold of that? Her screen name is "Meringue Girl Eri". Hello. The other day, you gave me your autograph by Festival Gate. I'm Aya Takeda. No, don't say her name! Stop it! Stop it! You mustn't say her name! - He hates this! - "I'm Aya Takeda!" Don't say her name! I hesitated to approach you, but I'm Aya Takeda! Time for a bat spank! Robi! Here I go! Wait! This is a farce! What's this? Looks like Aaru's angry! Someone else needs to go on trial! And who would that be? Koizumi! You! Why? You're messing with my girlfriend! Got nothing to say? Tell us how you feel now. How many seconds... did you have your tongue in her mouth? About 30 seconds. 30 seconds? Yeah, I've won. Listen. Aaru and Nao are finished. I'm gonna have sex with her next time. Stop it! Crusty from the precum... Crusty... Crusty... But that's all that happened! Tsurugi, stop it! Tsurugi, stop it! Kozumin, you should apologize right here. Kozumin, apologize! Apologize! - You're in the wrong! - Apologize. I'm sorry. That apology isn't enough to satisfy Aaru. I'm really... very sorry! Koizumi, this is how we make up! Stop! No more fighting! It should've been a moving finale, but Nishino ruined it by singing his heart out for some reason. The after-party. You're coming, right? Come on, get changed. No. Let's go to a French restaurant. But we've never had an after-party at a French place. Yes we have! Let's go to the after-party. My hat. Aaru has it. That was so funny! What was? I'm really very sorry! Enough already! It felt like as long as we could laugh, we could handle anything. But slowly but surely, time moved on. We all found other things just as important as Hello! Project, and we began to move on. All of us. Including me. [2008, Tokyo] Alright, the bass is OK. You're really good. Thanks. I'll sweep the entrance. I'm gonna go sweep. [Message from Kozumin] All except Kozumin, who hadn't really changed. For better or worse. What should we do with this? Reply to him, Tsurugi. You should give a reaction. What should I say? Tsurugi. [Mokkori Hachibee's Diary] [Just got my test result. Been diagnosed with lung cancer.] When was this? Just now. I wonder how he is. It came as such a shock. But Kozumin could turn anything to his advantage, and didn't go to hospital. You know, I have to be hospitalized today. I have cancer. Really? Should a cancer patient be coming to a place like this? No, I shouldn't. I might die, so could you give me extra services? I can't do that. Can't you? I'll pay extra. Vaginal sex is forbidden. No exceptions? I have cancer. But you look so healthy. Do you really have cancer? It's true. Come on, I'll give you an extra 5000. 5000? You must have more than that. Can't I use my national health insurance? Why should the state have to pay 70%? I'll persuade them to pay, so can't we work something out? Can you get that itch fixed along with your cancer? That's what he's doing. I regret feeling sorry for him. So he's leading a normal life, just like usual? Yeah, he's recovering well from his first operation. In fact, he seems fitter than ever. He was having a nurse rub ointment into his itchy crotch when we visited him. It was cured immediately. What!? It wasn't worth me worrying about him! Bye. He's fitter than ever. Tsurugi, a word? A friend of mine has a band. Their bassist has quit, so they asked me to ask you if you wanted to join. Really? The band the other day told them about you. They want to meet you. I'd love to. Really, So I can pass on your contact details? Of course. Thank you! What's up? Well... Tsurugi, are you glad you came to Tokyo? Yes, I am. Why do you ask? You know... You know, it's like... No, forget it. What is it? Just tell me. If you were still in Osaka with everyone, you could go visit him in hospital. But even if you were there, he'd still have got cancer. You know, it's like, I'm the one who... made you come here to Tokyo, so... Nakauchi, I'm having the best time in my life. It's true. What is this? Can you see... how faint this part is? It has spread to your bones. Sorry. I'm still alive. [Kozumin's Living Funeral] Idiots. Careful! And Kozumin is unveiled. Kozumin! Tsuru, long time no see. Nakauchi too. You came here by yourself? We would've gone to fetch you! I walked here. From the hospital? The anticancer drugs... The drugs aren't working? They're so expensive. How much do they cost? 6600 yen per pill. That much!? That was before. How much do they cost now? 10,510 yen each! You could get sucked off for that! I know. You don't need to tell me. The doctor says I'll die if I don't take 'em. Who can I complain to? You're as angry as ever! If he dies, he wants us to sue the drug company. I'll appear in court as a bronze statue. Why a bronze statue? Ultraseven and the Ultra Brothers became bronze statues. That wasn't Seven. Yes it was! Alien Hipporit appears in Ultraman Ace. Yeah. What an idiot! Huh? Don't fuck with me! So scary! It was Seven, right? No, it was Ace. Yeah, Ace. Ito, what do you say? I can't hear much in here. What did you say? Why are you crying? What an idiot. I remembered something. What? We had such a laugh back then. But seeing you cry now makes me wanna laugh! You're so funny! So funny! Huh? Not as funny as you apologizing on your hands and knees! Why did you get cancer? Such an idiot! In 2010, Kozumin still hadn't given up hope, and started using Twitter. [Haven't jerked off for a whole week. A new record.] Mr. Koizumi. Tsurugi, Tsurugi! Look. [Critcal condition] Critical condition? When was this? Just now. Must be bad. He can hardly type. You retweeted it? Yeah. I wanted to do that. Sorry. A tweet by a late-stage cancer patient in critical condition was so rare, it spread like wildfire. [My critical condition's been lifted!] [Maybe the doctor mistook my dosage. I thought I was gonna die.] Looks like he's still alive. Can critical condition be lifted? Now he's angry at the doctor. Still enraged. They say the good die first. So Kozumin... must be bad. Yeah, the worst. Yeah. He's horrible. Tsurugi sent these. There's one of Monami. But Kozumin doesn't watch adult videos anymore. He prefers anime and figures now. Really? How come? Ever since his illness, I guess he prefers two-dimensional characters to people. Right? Chunky chili oil. It's trending nowadays. He sent chili oil too. Shall we feed him some? No, you mustn't. He doesn't want it. But it's fine. You run faster if you eat spicy things. I read it in the sports paper. Yeah, if you're a horse! He doesn't want it. He complains about the price of drugs, so it'd be great if this cured him! What!? It costs 400 yen? - That's expensive! - It's that much? So it is. He doesn't want it. He's turning away. Kozumin came back from the verge of death so many times. [If I die, Ultraseven will return.] [What if Zoffy comes?] [I'll become a bronze statue.] But this turned out to be his last ever tweet. It ain't Seven, it's Ace! We're recording. Mr. Koizumi, how do you feel? What's the matter? Kozumin, I'm sorry. This may be the best time in my life. No? What's up? You showed a little kindness when you made me stew, but don't worry, everyone knows. Oh, you've dropped it. Here you are. You're a mean, lecherous, cowardly bully. A keyboard warrior. A complete lowlife. [Hidenori Koizumi Memorial Meeting] And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. Nishino. It's time for today's main event. The unveiling of Kozumin's statue. Look, look. His eyes light up. - Amazing, right? - But what for? Amazing, right? Yeah, but... So cool, right? Just a moment, hold on. What now? Even covered up, his eyes light up. As soon as we began, he'd suddenly open up. He liked me to finger his ass. His ass? He often asked for forbidden services. But now he's gone, I kind of regret not letting him. It must be... so embarrassing to die and be talked about like this. We'll make it more embarrassing when your time comes. No, don't do that! How do you feel about his death? You know, it's... I still can't believe he's dead. You still can't believe it. By the way, Ms. Kaoru, I heard you wanted to go to Mr. Koizumi's wake. Yes, after work, but at that late hour, I couldn't get in. I gave Mr. Nishino my condolence money. Huh? Mr. Nishino is also a regular. Why's she talking about me, too? Who cares if I'm a regular? Just a moment! Mr. Nishino likes ass play too. This is awful! We don't need to listen to this! I'm a victim here! You've victimized me! But I preferred Mr. Koizumi. What a loser! Why do I have to lose to him? Why do I have to lose to him? Kozumin, how's it going on the other side? In the years since you left, the city's changed so much, but all of us are fine. A lot has happened to me, but of course, I'm having the best time in my life. But I sometimes reminisce about all the fun we had back then. Tsuru. Kozumin. You haven't changed. You look older. Now you're there in Tokyo, I bet you've tired of idols. No I haven't. Sayumi Michishige said something great when she turned 30. Really? What did she say? "I was cute in my teens, cuter in my 20s, and I'm even cuter in my 30s. I'm always at my peak." That's what she said." Really? That's so cool. I miss life. I bet you don't know Beyonds. You'd love them. Really? Damn. I envy you. Morning Musume are as great as ever. You make me wish I could go to their gigs! I'm on my way to one now. I think I'll go with you. But the ticket's on you, OK? I know! Mr. Koizumi, how do you feel? What's the matter? No? What's up? Oh, you've dropped it. Here you are. Something else? Oh, I see. Alright, I'll put it back in.
