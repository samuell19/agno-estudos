Wait. Stop. To the Femina theater, quickly. 2 zloty. -Are you crazy? 80 grosz. -1 1/2. - 80 grosz. - 1 zloty. Don't hold me up. I'm late. Go, go, go, go. Hey, do you have any gloves? Do you have any gloves? Wait. Stop. You kidding? We have to get out of here. No, I'm not kidding. Stop or I'll jump. Run. They're not looking for women. Is that leather? It looks like leather. I'm cold. You should turn it in. Someone will report it. They'll kill you. Give it to me. I'll turn it in for you. If they kill me, I won't be cold anymore. Back up. Don't move. Stay quiet. Are you crazy? Stay quiet. Don't move, okay? I have nothing. Let me go. Hide. Hide. Hide, everyone. Wherever you are, please hide. Checkpoint? Checkpoint. Shit. You, my dear friend, you're going to remove your cap. Please, be so kind. Come, come, come, come. Come here. Stop. You know what to do. And you, please. You. And you. Funny, huh? Very funny. You need to smile at least. Much better. Yes. Give me a smile. I want to see a smile. It's funny. Yes, beautiful smiles. All right. Listen to this. Yosef goes to see the rabbi and says, "Rabbi, I have a problem. I like two women -- my wife and another one. Can I be with both at the same time?" The rabbi says no. "Thank you, rabbi. Very wise." Now, after a few days, Yosef goes back to the synagogue, and now he's very angry. He says, "Rabbi, I asked for your advice, and your answer was clear, but I just found out that you live with two women yourself. How do you explain that?" And the old man answers, "I didn't ask the rabbi." I've got another one. -What's the 11th commandment? -Beats me. Thou shalt choose thy grandparents carefully. Yeah, I wish I had. You're late, Stefcia. Where were you? I better not tell you. One of us might be working for the Gestapo. Ah, giving classes, huh? They give me soup. I don't think you should get too attached -to those children, Stefcia. -They give me soup. - You're late. - There was a hunt and a checkpoint. Well, at least you showed up. Patryk isn't here yet. Where is he? Nobody knows. It's a sell-out crowd, girls. Well, that's the good part about movie theaters being closed, isn't it? Well, I like movies. Are we in spring? Yes, in spring. Not now, Sarah. Here, put talc on those hands and cover them up, dear. Sarah, you should read this. Niusia. I don't want to see those things in here. You need to change your boyfriend. He's no good for you. You'll get us all into trouble. It's time for everyone to know the truth. Oh, the truth. The truth is clear enough. Are you crazy? No, you're the one that's crazy. Finally good for something. Well, ladies, two minutes to curtain. Today they will take their hands out of their coats and clap. Let's go. Oh, great. Jozek broke something again. -Is he drunk? -He's gonna stink when we kiss. Edmund has bad breath too. No, he doesn't. I guess love not only makes you blind. Well, if I remember correctly, eating makes your breath smell better. What? What are we laughing about? About you, Edmund, and about love. Ah, love is my specialty, Ada. My bounty is as boundless as the sea. My love is deep. For the more I give it to thee, the more I have, -for both are infinite. -Okay. Um, firstly, that's Juliet's line, you Romeo. Secondly, that's the wrong Juliet. I was about to say that. What am I thinking, Stefcia? My bounty is as boundless as the sea. My love is deep. For the more I give to thee, the more I have for both are infinite. You're such an idiot. How are you doing, Sarah? Do you have a fever? -No. -Okay. Don't you dare do that on stage. Don't you dare speak to my sister like that. Go back to the dressing room, Sarah, and sit by the heater. All right? Go on. Romeo and Juliet were fools. Sorry? Who wants to die for love? We have to go on stage. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You've got talc on your face. Go. If that kid ruins the performance, I'll give her a special talking to. That's enough, you two. Honestly. You have to play a happy couple in a second. God. Where the hell is Patryk? Who will raise the curtain? Have Jozek do it. God, people will leave before it's over -to get home before the curfew. -I'll handle it. With your hands? Not with my feet, that's for sure. They will clap today, I promise. Just wait till close. We'll see. Edmund, you're hanging Grandma upside-down. She looks a lot better this way. Oh, come on. Give me the hammer. Ada, we can put your grandmother behind the bust of Chopin. The old lady will be glad to have a man around. That is not Chopin. That is Julius Caesar. After a night on the town. Patryk is finally here. Where was he? How should I know? You are hammering nails in the wall? Better than in the windows, my dear landlady. No hammering or the walls will crumble. They'll crumble anyway. What should I do with Grandma then? Ada, we can put your grandmother under the bed. Oh! Then use her as a tray when we have visitors. -Edmund! -Ada! -No visitors. -Excuse me? No visitors. Maybe you're not afraid of typhoid. Maybe you've been vaccinated. But I can't afford to. You play violin? I use it to hunt rats. Of course I play violin. In that case, I have to tell you right away that kind of thing is not permitted here. I already have one of those characters in the building. That guy from the Femina theater lives next door. He's always plinking away on the piano morning till night. At least he played a melody, but no. Ah, you see? Pure cacophony. You know there were two whole families in there before and they made less noise? Well, I only play beautiful melodies. Do you have a favorite tune? I'd be glad to play it for you. We only boil water once a day. No doing laundry or the floor will get wet. Don't spend longer than two minutes on the toilet. And no tossing paper in there either, or it'll back up. -Better not use any paper. -I love what you wrote. Better not use the toilet at all. Don't break Napoleon. He belonged to my husband. It's definitely Chopin. We have to talk. We're on in a second. - Now. - Okay. There we go. Okay... We're leaving the ghetto. What? We're leaving the ghetto, you and me, tonight. What do you mean, you and me? What about Edmund? I don't have money for him. I bribed two SS guards. They won't shoot us. What, because they're SS? We'll go to my village. I know people. They'll hide us in a barn somewhere. I'm with Edmund, Patryk. I don't want to marry you. I'm trying to save your life. Where did you get the money? Don't ask. Tonight. What are you doing? You're on next. Tonight after the show. I always had more than one suitor when I was young too. I married the one that gave me his grandmother's wedding ring. Wrong choice. ...coming and going, things start to disappear. We need to be careful. Mundy, did you put the note on the door? Of course, Ada, with our name and "ring five times." -Five times? -Sure. I already learned it by heart. One ring, Finklestein. Two rings, the Goldberg family. Three rings, the piano player. Four rings, the dentist. What's his name? I just can't stand dentists. And five times, us. Oh. One. Two. -Three. -That's the piano player.

We don't agree either. I'm a new assignment, though. I spent all my money on bribes. Ada, we can't kick him out on the street. He'll freeze or be beaten to death or the other way around. A lone bachelor won't take up a lot of room. Well, as if there were a lot of room to take up. Patryk, will you hold this box, please? I've got the iron and the dominoes and my hat and the cactus. You sure you're not somewhere in there too? A lone bachelor? Stefcia? Mundy, what are you doing here? I live here. Ada, allow me to introduce Stefcia. We performed together last year at Greenspan's. She's a beautiful singer. I'm sure. Pleased to meet you. The pleasure's all mine. Do you live here, too? Too? Edmund, I thought you talked to the housing office. I was going to do it tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow, just not today. That's what the smart people say. Wisdom is a different way. Couldn't you get us a vacant room, my darling Patryk? The housing office thought that this one was free. Officials who think? Now, that's a contradiction. This is definitely my husband's fault. Why do I even need a husband if I have to do everything myself? That is right. How long have you been married, anyway? Since this morning. How about you? -Since yesterday. -Twice as long. -I know. -Congratulations. How many marriages last that much? May I make a suggestion, Stefcia? I have one too. The four of us could live here together. -That's my suggestion too. -Let's go talk to the landlady. Let's go. What is wrong with you? I'm fine. Fine, thanks for asking. No, you missed your cue twice. Pull yourself together. Didn't do it on my own yet. Show me a happy woman and I'll show you the eighth wonder of the world. Ada. What? What would you be willing to do to leave the ghetto? Well, that's easy if you don't mind being dead. What would you be willing to do? Anything. You? Let's go, girls. We're not on holiday. Let's just let the women handle it. The landlady agrees. Isn't that right, Mrs. Landlady? -We'll split the room two ways. -Excellent. But you'll have to pay the same rent as they do. But it's only one room. You don't play violin, do you? No, I work for the Jewish Council. In that case, I'll need the rent up front. You'll be very happy here. We just need another bed. -Oh, Edmund! -Ada! What are you doing? My God. I hope your God listens better than mine. You have your shoes on the bedspread. Should I take it off? Oh, there's a cigarette butt on the floor. What's it doing there? I kicked it under the bed. - Edmund! - Ada! I'll put it on our side of the room. That way, there -- there won't be any fighting. You know what? This is a shame. We should all be honeymooning right now, not locked in behind a wall, no room of our own. Not even a toilet. Well, even if we had the money, where would we go? We're not even allowed to ride the tram. The ghetto is no place for love stories. We just have the horse-drawn bus. It doesn't go far, but it's slow. He's right.

Damn it, Edmund. What if there were informers in the audience? So what? Do you want the Germans to shut down the theater? The SS doesn't care if we make fun of collaborators, Ada. Patryk, can you please tell him not to change the play? Let him. Let him? Let him. Did you see the faces of the Jewish police? -They did not see that coming. -Edmund. The way they looked at me, the audience, did you see their faces? I mean, I killed it. You know, we need to close the act better. You need another line to end on a higher note, you know? We need to talk to Patryk. They were this close to applauding. -Edmund. -Stefcia. Patryk wants to escape tonight after the show. -Tonight? -He bribed someone. Who? He -- He can't do that. Can he do that? With what money? He wants me to go with him. What? -How long have you known? -I told him I won't go. I want to be here with you. -But do you want to go with him? -No. -Do you want to stay here? -No. I want to be with you. -Do you want me to go? -No. I want... I don't know what I want. -Edmund. -Later, later. Can you maybe go any slower? Get out of here. Is it really so smart to drink before you go on, Jozek? I don't call it wise. Want some? It's the real stuff. She okay? Take her a while. Hey, Niusia. Quit playing resistance fighter, okay? I'm serious.

Nobody can. Some people do. How do you know that? You didn't know. Some people do things, yeah, without anybody finding out, but your brother and I don't need to. Stefcia? What? You were with Patryk before, right? You done there again? Yes. I was with Patryk a long time ago. Before. Did you love him? He took care of me when my father was killed. He was there for me. You think I'll find someone like that? Like Patryk? I know someone who should have been on stage two minutes ago. Damn it. Shit. Shit, shit. - You're late, Stefcia. - No shit. They've rearranged the scene. It's like watching a shipwreck. Ada's gonna rip my head off. Stefcia! Stefcia, if you were here -- Can I be of any help? I don't know where Stefcia left the, uh, urinal. There are some things a man must do himself. Maybe you could try the bathroom. I was just there. It's occupied. But I guess I'll try again. It's been two months, Edmund, and it's always the same. I clean, you make it dirty. I clean, you make it dirty. Again, where is your second sock? I don't even know where first sock is. Here's the first. Are you gonna be like this the whole time? Think I'm happy about staying, that I want to die here? It's going to be stuffed in your mouth, that's for sure. Damn it, the bathroom is still occupied. Does anybody know? Where Stefcia is? That girl disappears as soon as you turn your back on her. Don't touch that! Calm down, Edmund. Darling. I think I'll try again. If he won't let you go, then maybe -- Maybe what? Maybe he doesn't really love you. I would love to. I would love to. And what makes you so sure he won't let me? At least I don't spend all day and night cleaning, Ada. Occupied, occupied, occupied. All the ghetto could be burning down, Ada, and you would still be sweeping up the ashes. You know what? You're right. I'm leaving. Can nobody stand being in this room? I need fresh air. And I need to go too! He's really fast for a public servant. Does anyone care about this play? Go and rest a little. You're back on after the duet. Oh, God. Wake up, Patryk. That train left a long time ago. Write your next song for someone who cares about you. Otherwise, write it for me. I dreamed about you today. About me? It was such an odd dream. We were both driving down an alley in a rickshaw. It was dark everywhere. So creepy. And behind us, a headlight appeared like a locomotive. Puff, puff, puff, chasing as quickly as if the train wanted to swallow us up and take us to nowhere. And then I remember thinking, "It must be past the curfew and we shouldn't be outside anymore." Suddenly I was so scared. And the locomotive kept getting faster, puff, puff, puff, and the headlights blinded me. Puff, puff, puff, and I wanted to scream and scream. -But then -- -Then? I would have been scared to death if you hadn't been there for me. Do you remember that? I sung that every night. I remember everything. Everything?

That really was quite a bit. Come on. You're leaving with Patryk. End of discussion. -That's my decision. -We're not gonna argue, Stefcia. -If you don't go, I will. -Look. We can all escape. No, we can't. I don't know how Patryk got the money, but I don't have it, and you don't either. -And we can't get it. Okay? -Yes. Yes, we can. No, we can't, Stefcia. We're not smugglers or Judenrat crooks. -We're actors. -We can ask Patryk. - But a drunkard will. - No, no. You say, "Two people from different faiths will never get along when two drunkards..." I'll find a way. Go. Okay. How are you doing, Sarah? You look like you've been eaten and spat out. Anyone would think that the audience was throwing rotten tomatoes at you. But are they? What did you hear? Hear? Um, not much. How much is that? I heard that you need money. You, uh -- You don't like soup anymore? You could always turn Niusia in to the Germans. But then maybe, who knows, maybe they'll throw you in jail and they'll close the theater. So maybe... Maybe there's another way. You're very pretty, Stefcia. And you're an actress. So... You wouldn't have to walk the streets. You could turn tricks at the Polonia. You wouldn't get 1,000 zlotys, but... ...you could have a good life. Well, a better one. You could eat. And so could they. That little girl wouldn't have to starve. Neither would he. Neither would you. I'd really like to help you, Stefcia. What are you waiting for? You've got an audience to entertain. Music, not a tune. The play's a hit. They may even -- I know. I know. ...coming and going, things start disappearing. Can't trust anyone in the ghetto. I mean, just think, someone hangs up their hat in the lobby, who knows if they've been at the bazaar and picked up some bug. Do you want coal or electricity to cook? We don't have electricity. We don't have any coal either. Please be quiet. I don't want any parties. That was not a party. Mr. Finklestein lives next door. He has a job. He needs peace. Wrong ambition for a Jew. Not another word. Silence, silence, silence. Don't worry. It's not tuberculosis. She shouldn't smoke, but she can afford to, you know. This pays for her cigarettes. I can pay you more. Anybody home? - I'm here. - Oh. What are you doing on that side? Ada invited me to breakfast. Fake tea with no sugar, applesauce without apples made with real radishes. -And why did she invite you? -Because you weren't here. Otherwise, she would have invited you. That woman's worth a fortune. No, much less. She's so organized. She had a couple of friends over as well, and -- Come in. Oh. Apollo, help me. Excuse me. My name is Zylberman. Oh, I'm sorry, we can't have visitors. Visitors? Visitor I'm not. I'm head of the House Committee, huh? Mwah. Ah. Ah, my dear lady. We are putting on a party on Saturday. Now, there's going to be dance music and a raffle. Wonderful prizes. And I was wondering if I could ask you to do us the honor of performing for us. - I'd love to. - She'd love to. Wonderful! Now, the thing is, you see, it's like this. Feinminster, he lives in number three. He is the richest tenant in the house, and he pays most of the budget of the House Committee. -And is that bad? -No, bad it's not. But he's got a daughter, and she sings. What does she sing? She don't sing normal. She sings What you call it? Corotolura. Cholera? No, God forbid, not cholera. Do you mean coloratura? Culturalura, that's it. So I was wondering if you could give a little listen to this girl, and then you tell me and I'll tell the committee, is she qualified to sing? -I'd be glad to. -She'd be glad to. You don't have to repeat everything I say. -I'm trying to help. -Don't be angry. -I'm not angry. -Oh, yes, you are. -You're angry at me. -I'm not angry at all. Well, I can tell you're angry. -I'm not angry, damn it. -You're angry. Well, now I am angry! I can't take any more of this! He can be very sensitive sometimes. Yeah, I noticed. Now, uh, getting back to our "maluctacarul"... The girl. Yeah. The girl. Maybe she's good. Maybe she is. But maybe... Maybe she's Well, she mistakes a lung for a liver. Excuse me.

We work together at the council. We even had breakfast together today here with Ada and my girlfriend, Niusia. -You know Niusia? -You know Niusia? There aren't many of us in the ghetto. There are less every day. So Niusia and I had a fight. I want to get married, but she said I have to be sober before I proposition her. Hmm. In this world. And do you love her? Who knows? Who looks for true love anymore? Yeah. Want some? It's very inspiring. If we don't starve to death, we'll kill them with grief. You will end each act on a sad note. They will never clap this way. We end on a romantic note as planned. You take humor too seriously. It is not about me. It's about them. Where did you get the money? Go and get changed. - Where, Patryk? - What does it matter? Maybe there's more. Did you steal it? From who? Who, Patryk? Grósze. Grósze the dentist? No, Grósze the gnome. Yes, the dentist. He yanks out your gold teeth for peanuts and he makes ten times more selling them to the Germans. -He's scum. -Does he know you robbed him? Forget it, Stefcia. Does he know? I hit him. You hit him. I hit him. Did you hurt him? I don't know. He fell against the... Don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay. It's okay. Nothing will happen to you, okay?

Would you do something bad? Would you steal for me? Would you kill? What would you do to not lose me? What would you be willing to do? I'm not gonna stop you, Stefcia. Okay? You're not gonna die here. -You must leave with Patryk. -No, no. You have to. You know you do. No. -Stefcia. -No. -Come on. -No. Stefcia! Follow me. Stefcia. I want the money. You crazy? What are you talking about? I want the money. You stole it. Give it to me. You need to calm down, Stefcia. We can't talk right now. I'll report you. -You stole it. -I stole it for you. There's nothing between us, Patryk. I'm with Edmund. And if you really loved me -- -You've lost your mind. -If you really loved me -- Stefcia! Stefcia. Trouble in paradise? Oh, shut up. You're crushing me. No, it's okay. It's just for a second, okay? Sorry. Sorry, sweetie. Okay. You can paint. Do you like spying on people? Who doesn't? I don't. I've loved a lot of men.

Please come have a drink. -Oh, but I can't -- -This way. Won't let us make any noise, right? Oh, well, if you insist. I just wanted to tell you that I'll be having a little celebration soon, too. -Ah. -Oh, what's the occasion? Who cares? Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! Well, ladies and gents -- Oh.

To find out what I wrote. For Niusia. For you, Irena. We all have something to keep quiet. He's in Hashomer Hatzair. What the fuck are you saying, Niusia? That's -- That's not true. Radical bastards. We got to turn them both in. They saw you -- the printers. You're lying. Niusia, are you sure? I don't know. I know nothing about politics. I'm not even a Zionist. Tell them, Stefcia. -Tell them -- -Edmund. Germans like spending time with us as much as we like spending time with them. Now, come on. You tell me right now. What is he doing here? He's alone. So what? Maybe he's not here for -- for anyone. Maybe he's just here to see the play. Stefcia's right. I mean, they don't come alone when they come looking for you. Right? Right? I have to get out of here. No, no, no! He'll suspect. Stefcia's right. Look, we need to stay calm. No one will be arrested today. It's the end of the intermission. It's not the fucking intermission. Raise the curtain. Jozek -- Raise the curtain. Ah, excuse me for disturbing you at this late hour. Did you bring the girl? Stefcia isn't home. No, that's not why I came. The girl may be tomorrow. What's it about? Oh, it's about -- Oh. -Hello. -Hi. It's about... ...donations. This is a big house we live in, and most of the tenants escape with their With the butter-side down? Mm-hmm, that's why we have the house committee. It's our duty to help the poor. - Of course, sure. - Sure. Wherever I go, the only thing that people ever want to tell me is - The wheel is broken. - Yes. What's happening? But I'd never name names. Never. Nothing. But Dr. Rautmann, who lives upstairs, eh, he'll never understand. There's people escaping. Their heart avek. They've lost heart. Well, we don't belong to those tightwads. We'll pay our membership fee regularly. -And happily. -We will. Oh, good. Say, excuse me, did you say membership fee? -Yes, why? -No, no, it's fee...s. - You pay two fees? - Yeah. Two?

Very pretty, Sarah. Everything will be fine. I want it to be perfect. Sometimes when you relax a little, it comes out better. Is that true? No. Come here. Come on. Hey. You love your brother a lot, don't you? -Yes. And you. -But him more. And you want what's best for him, right? -I don't know. -What's more important to you, to be with me or with your brother? To take care of him? I don't know. Come on. Intermission. The Germans seem to be getting bored. I don't like it. What he wants -- What he wants doesn't matter. Or what anyone else wants. We need to talk. Outside. We can't stay in the dressing room? No. Wait. What was that? It's far away. Go. -Too cold for Sarah. -I know. I'm sorry. Do you want to say goodbye to us? Sarah, you must tell him what you said to me before -- What you said to me before, that you'd rather be with Edmund. -Stefcia, please -- -Tell him that you love him, -that you won't let him -- -Stefcia! God. Right. Go back inside, Sarah, yeah? -Can I rehearse? -Yeah. Tell Ada to help you, alright? Go on. What are you playing at, Stefcia? I'm not playing. You know, you don't need to do this. You know that, don't you? You don't need to be angry to leave. It'll make me angry. Why is it so easy for you to give me up? -What? -Why aren't you fighting for me? Why aren't you trying to stop me from leaving? Why is it so easy for you to let me go? Because I don't want you to die. We're all going to die. We're already dead. They starve us to death, drive us crazy. They give us hope and then take it away. -We can -- -We can't do anything, Edmund. What can you do? Except look at me with that face, like... "I don't understand you, Stefcia. I love you so much, I'm willing to give you up"? Bullshit. Loving someone means doing anything you have to, anything necessary. What do you want? What do you want? -I want you to live. -I want to live! With you! What do you want me to do, Stefcia? What can I do? Do you want to -- to steal Patryk's money from him? And leave Sarah here alone to die? She's going to die anyway! Then we'll do it together. I... Wha... Why don't you just go already? Just -- Just leave. - Here. It's cold. - Yeah. Not a single Jew without their coat. Irena said she would've brought it to you herself, but, um, well, then she couldn't eavesdrop on you, hmm? -How does she do it? -May the invisible survive. Yeah. -Yeah. -This -- They say it makes you go blind, but, sadly, no. Do you believe in life after death, Stefcia? I'd settle for there being one before. What do you think? I know there's... I'm a convert. Three generations. Doesn't matter. To them, I'm a Jew. Mazel tov. Here. Do you ever wonder what you'd be doing right now if there was no war? Never. Yeah, me neither. You have... I don't have anyone, Stefcia. I know. I felt so bad for you. Yeah, I know. She was a -- She was a good person. We both know she wasn't. It's good enough for me. That's how I like her. Oh. Or liked her. It's good to -- to love someone. Yeah. To love or be loved -- it's the eternal question. Which is better? It's not like you have a choice. Plato, Aristotle. Last act. If it's okay for you, if you're not too busy, I am sure the German will appreciate the gesture. Let's go get 'em. Whew! Stefcia. Sorry.

I would love to get married. I want to be with you. - Do you really love me? - Stefcia. I know what to do. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Stefcia, wait. -Jozek wants to read us -- -Yeah, yep, I know, yep, yes. - Stefcia! - I'll be right back. ♪ She's gone ♪ Are you crazy? You know I am. ♪ Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone ♪ - Can I go now? - Yes, let's -- No, no, no, no, no, not so fast. Stay here. This way, you can keep me company. Let's hear what Jozek -- Maybe -- Maybe we can... Wait here. Edmund, come with me. I need you. I can't. Jozek is reading us a letter from Ada. "So, I'm afraid our relationship has become impossible. I have to leave you." There, you heard it. She's leaving you. Now get moving. -But -- -Sing! - Stefcia! - Sing, sing!

I was wrong. -I love you. I always have. -But -- -Quiet. I've been thinking. -When? All along. You'd do anything for me, Edmund. I've seen it, I know, and I'm touched, but he -- he would do things that are wrong, and that counts, too. -No, I n-- -It's okay, Patryk, it's a fact. I already told you that I love you. -You don't love me. -If I say I love you, I love you, and you love me more than he does. But you love him more than me. Because I was wrong about him. It's nothing personal. What are you doing here? The big finale's coming up. Tell Niusia to take my place. Niusia will not take your place. She said that the German's looking for her. Then you do it. No, it's not my scene. For the love of God, Ada! Improvise! There is nothing you can do to make what's happening here any worse. There's no time to pack. You need to go right -- I'm not going anywhere, Stefcia. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here in the ghetto. I'm not leaving with this fool who you also happen to love. I don't love him. I love you. I can't leave Sarah here. Of course not. That's why you're taking her with you. -What are you saying? -What? Just think about it, Patryk. Forget about me. Forget about Edmund. Don't you see it? No, I don't quite understand. Let Edmund and Sarah go. Sarah hasn't lived yet. -Edmund has. -She's going to need him. And I'll stay here at your side. But we have so much to give people. To make them laugh. You will write, I'll be your performer. We can make them forget their pain for a short while. And who knows? Maybe we'll survive all this. Maybe the Russians come and free us, maybe. Yeah, we can live a long life together. Even have kids. Do you want kids? I want to live. You're just making me think that we could be together, right? Yes. You're a good actress. I know. You love Edmund more than your own life. I do. And I love you more than mine. Let's do it. I don't have a say in this? No. Jozek will have to play your part. His character will be eliminated, and you'll have to sing Sarah's song. -Ada won't like that. -No, she won't. You sure about this? Of course not. Finale? Finale. Come on. Finale. Listen! Listen, everyone. I have a solution. We have to be honest with each other. Ada has to stay with Patryk. I don't mind. You'll enjoy her more than I will. There's nothing more to discuss. It's decided. And you, Edmund, if you love me... -Yes, I do. -I love you, too. And you two, Niusia and Jozek, together, as well! If this idiot could lay off the bottle. Otherwise, you -- Halt! Halt! Thank you very much. Thank you all. I'm so sorry to interrupt in the best moment. But doesn't it always seems like we always get interrupt in the best moment? Ah, not again. Ha! That's the bad thing when you start shooting. You know when to start, but -- There. I would like a word with you, miss. No, no, no, no, no. Not you. No. You look a bit ill to me. Are you feeling alright? You sure? I'm so glad. Miss -- you. If you don't mind me calling you "miss." Are you married? -I was. -She was, she says. Marriages don't last very long nowadays, do they? Do they? No. So true. Ma'am, I'm addressing you because you look like an intelligent person, someone other people will listen to. I'm addressing you, persuaded that by doing so, the rest of you will pay attention to me. It's silly, isn't it? Very prudent. I wouldn't say anything in your shoes, either. I mean, who knows what I want to hear? But I'm not in your shoes now, am I? Or yours or yours...or yours. I'm in my own. Today, I would like you and I, dear friends, to understand each other a little better. I understand that you need to entertain yourself, like doing Jewish things, like dance and prayers, little plays. I like to laugh, too. I really do. Ja! Ja. Ja! Funny. I've come here tonight... Are you in the resistance, Edmund? Not anymore. Not anymore, and he can't possibly know. I swear to God, if anything happens to -- Silence! Silence! Silence! Please! I'm sorry, but it's just that, otherwise, I get lost. I'm a reasonable man. I understand, for example, that you read. I mean, who doesn't like to read? Well, I don't, but who cares? And, of course, if there isn't much to read, you need to print things. Like children's stories or newspaper, which is likely forbidden in that funny language of yours. And -- which is perfectly fine -- an occasional leaflet. I'm not angry, don't get me wrong. I mean, who am I to judge anyone? I wouldn't think of it, but -- Not again. I better be more careful, right? Otherwise, I would run out of bullets. Although...there are always more bullets. And those little leaflets aren't, I was saying, handwritten. And there aren't five or six of them. I mean, who would make five leaflets? Well, five Jews, you would say, but are there only five of you? Perhaps one day. We mustn't be impatient. And therefore, you'd need a printer for the little leaflets. And if I hear that you have a printer, I start getting nervous. And if I happen to find it, I-I get a bit more nervous and I start asking questions. Nervous. And that's when I come here, and my -- my finger gets away from me. Boom! No. Because I'm nervous. And you might say this rifle has something loose, and that's not good. So... I leave it here, and I'll take out this pistol, which is more solid and -- and reliable. It only fires when I want it to. Because I don't care about the little leaflets, but I do care about the printers. You know why? Because with a printer, you can print leaflets, disgusting propaganda, or safe conducts, and I can't allow anyone to print safe conducts that break this harmony that we achieved. Your people. My people. You understand. Don't you, ma'am? You're smarter than your husband. So... now that I've made my position clear to all of you... You're making a mistake. Please. I haven't done anything. No, of course not. Funny. I think we understand each other now. A fantastic show. I'm so glad I came. Please continue. What the fuck happened here? What did you do? What did you do? I didn't know him. There are more resistance groups than Jews. Can't trust anyone anymore. What do we do now? Nothing. Let's -- Let's finish the play. What? She said, "Let's finish the play." What are you talking about? We can't go on. -They just -- -This is what we are! What we have left. If Irena says that we finish the play, then we finish the play! - Let's do it. - Come on. We're actors. This is what we do. Let's do it. On with the show. Sit down, everybody! We can finish before the curfew. We can still have that. Sit your fucking arses down! Come on! And you better clap this time, Goddamn it! Come on! Patryk loves Ada. And I love you. So why the drama? Get a divorce and marry me. It's not like we're Catholic anyway. Whoo! Ha! You really don't mind, Ada? Oh, if you don't mind that I love Patryk. Kiss me. Kiss me, my love. Kiss me, Patryk. Know what? If Niusia and I get married tomorrow, six of us will have to live in this room together. Oh, I'll get another room divider. But you'll have to pay the same as they do. That's very generous of you, dear landlady. Oh, my -- my love. But Jozek and I can't go on a honeymoon. Don't be glum, Niusia. When there's nothing you can do...
