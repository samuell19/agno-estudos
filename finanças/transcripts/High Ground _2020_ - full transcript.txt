Who scared the wallaby? Now, son. You're scaring the animals away. What are we going to eat? Just watch and learn. One day your time will come to be a hunter. Okay, son? Hey, you hungry? Bush plums. Keep you going. I want this spear. No, this is mine. I am the snake. Baywara. I strike like lightning. My name is Baywara. I am the snake. And you. Your totem is the crocodile. Your name is Gutjuk, means hawk. This is your dance. It's okay. Please help us. Station men are chasing us. It's okay, they're friendly. Why is Gutjuk in such a hurry to grow up? He only wants to be with the men. Gutjuk, come here. Wallaby's ready to eat. Sit down with your mother. He needs to learn his place. Gutjuk, come back. Station owners got the police because we killed a cow. Will you let 'em know we don't want any trouble? All right? I understand. You may stay. But only for one night. I don't want trouble for my family. What are we waiting for? No-one shoots but him. All right? Yeah, I'm here, Eddy. What are you doin'? Watch him, Eddy. It's our land we should fight. How far away are they? I think we lost them. Baywara. Stop. Jesus! What are you saying? What are you telling me? I'll come back. Breathe through here. That's good. Stay under. I'll be back. Did I get her? And as whoever lives, shall never die. For I am the resurrection... Look away. ...and the life. Look away! Everyone who lives in me and believes in me shall never die. It's all right. I got you. Easy. Calm down. What are you doin'? Put the bloody thing away. Okay. All good. You take care of him? It's okay, mate. Hey? Hey? You got him? Where's his family? What happened? Travis, are you all right? Yeah. It's all right. Come on. What'll we tell Moran? It's gonna take all three of us. Braddock. Have a seat. I think we tell him what happened. McGuinness. He's been shooting his mouth off all over the Territory about killing the blackfella that burned him out. The bastard was dying to put a bullet in someone. He came out of nowhere and started shooting at anything that moved. It was supposed to be a peaceful expedition. Mate... it was chaos. Who fired first? Why does that matter? It matters. They're dead. What matters is that we act as a unit. I'm not lyin'. So you... you blame me? That... is it... is it my fault? All of it? Is that what's goin' on? Seventeen dead. John? Just children. Come on. Claire. My brother's a mess. You were supposed to be in charge. You can tell Moran whatever you want. I'm not stickin' around for it. My children, my family. Who did this to my family? Wak Wak, my beautiful daughter. My beloved daughter. Baywara, my son, look at me. You'll be okay. I will heal you. All right, let's go, Jimmy! The little one. Travis. Police coming. Okay. Moran. What's he want? Okay. Get down. Get down, both of you. Get down. That's it. It's the responsibility of those who make history... to record it. That's it. Hold it. It's done. Good! You're here for a reason. What is it? It started a few months back. A bunch of black bastards wreaking havoc. Killing livestock, burning stations. Galbay! Get that water over here! Hang on! I'm here! They're calling 'em "The Wild Mob". They're from all over the place. Brought together by one man... Baywara. A bunch of myalls, fugitives. - Get the horses! - The bastards are everywhere. The Wild Mob. They're here. Where are those bastards? Move 'em, move 'em! Those black bastards will pay for this. A couple of weeks ago, they crossed a line. They killed a white woman. Why? There's always a why. This Baywara is a survivor from your mess. Same stone spear. Since you deserted us, there's been a lot of eyes on us from down south. The Commissioner is talking about a full-scale punitive expedition to bring this mob in. I don't need to tell you what happens if this Baywara gets a voice. Maybe the truth comes out. The truth's a funny thing. Once it's out it's out. And questions come with it. Like... how did two whitefellas end up with your bullets in them? Fortunately, we've been able to persuade the higher-ups that there are other ways to handle this situation. Eddy? It'll just be you and me. We track 'em down, go in quiet... and take Baywara and his mob out. Don't tell me it doesn't haunt you... that you don't want it off your back. And shooting him does that, you reckon? See, I reckon I'd be better off shooting the two of you right now. I told you he'd have a sense of humour about it. I'm not kidding. Son... we got through the war by sticking together. Trusting each other. Now we'll get through this... together. Help me! Who are you? What do you want? Baywara. He's my uncle. Go on, spear me. You can tell my uncle you killed his nephew. Leave him. Uncle? Gutjuk? Welcome. What sorrow for you who buy up house after house and field after field, until everyone is evicted and you live alone in the land. We're talking about the murder of a white woman. Tommy's got nothing to do with this mob. It's a new station. He was helping out. He's a... he's a good boy. John, you know why we need to talk to him. Thank you. Who's the kid? That's the kid you pulled out of the creek. You wanted to talk to me, sir? - That's right. Tommy, is it? - Yes sir. You tell me what you know about the fire, and I might let you breathe again. Does that sound good to you? Come on, son. Everyone knows somethin'. - Eddy. - Just a sec. You're with the mob, aren't you? And you led them to that station. - Didn't you? - Eddy! Tell me what you fuckin' know! Leave it, Eddy! Leave it! Fuckin'... get your fuckin'... get the fuck off me! The fuck's wrong with you? Bloody hell. So much for keepin' it quiet. You're going to kill my uncle. Well, see, that depends on you. You know where he is? If I'll help you find him, what will you do? Will you keep him safe? I'll do my best. That's all I got. He knows more than he's lettin' on. So he's with 'em? Yeah. And you're just gonna let the little bastard walk you into a trap? Well, if his mind's on that, maybe he won't see what I'm doin'. Which is what? Use him as bait. I'll talk to Braddock. And his sister. Where do you want me to put it? Just on the table, Johnny. Thank you. You know it was my idea to bring you in, don't ya? Yeah, I figured. Our mistake. That's how you see it? Our mistake? Yeah, I do. Then why are you dropping me for this kid? I won't make the same mistake twice. That's a ludicrous idea. Tommy's not a tracker. And I doubt he'd have any idea where the mob is. - He says different. - And you believe him? We'll compensate the mission, of course. Might help you to get that church finally finished. Get more people in. No. It's not really your choice, is it? They went for it. Go to Baywara. Tell him I'm bringing the police out to him. - Okay? - Yes, I heard you. I was gonna come find you. I know you were. Look after yourself. It's their war not yours. Don't trust them. If anything happens to him... I don't expect to see your face again. Take that saddle off. It's just you and me. Where do you think you're goin'? You don't need me here. Of course I do. What do you think he's going to do out there? Travis has no sense of duty, no sense of loyalty. That's a problem. Why just you and me? - You're not worried? - No. So what's your name? - Tommy, sir. - Tommy, eh? Bullshit. That the name your mother gave you? Not my mum. Where are we going? Well, I thought you were the tracker. What's gonna happen when we find him? Well, we're gonna convince him to come in . How we gonna do that? Well, that's why you're here. Tea is too weak. Another fella coming. What's he doin' here? Have you got a problem with Walter? I can handle Travis myself. I don't need that half-caste bastard. Eddy... that is no way to talk about an officer of the law. You give me a couple of days, I can have half a dozen men who won't say a word... - Son... - ...and we can sort this out. We tried your way. Walter doesn't make mistakes. Walter! Bad fella that one. Queensland native policeman. He kills his own. He's watching me. Gutjuk. It means "hawk". My name is Gutjuk. It's good to know. What are we doing here? When you got the high ground... you control everything. Have a look. - What do you see? - Ooh. It all comes up. It sure does. Now, if we're, ah... if we're gonna work together, you should probably learn to shoot. Yeah. Okay. You got that? On your belly. Feet apart. Get all solid. All right? Solid. Yeah, get that... get that butt up in on your shoulder. Stay calm. Get it right up in there. Chamber the bullet. That's it. Now pick something. And, uh... shoot. Shit! It's loud. Yeah. You're not kiddin'. This time... just stay calm. Chamber the bullet. That's it. Right. Breathe slowly... and gently squeeze the trigger. Jesus! That's pretty good. That's pretty good. When you got the high ground, you control... when to engage. I saw some of them mob back there. You've got one chance to save your uncle's life, now. While I'm in control. You understand? Where is he? Suit yourself. Shit! Do you reckon he knows we're here? You worried? I thought they bred 'em tougher in Queensland. I bumped into this Travis this one time. I'm worried because I'm not stupid. Our doubts are traitors, Walter. Up on the ridge... - is it Eddy? - Hmm. He's come to kill my uncle? No, I-I think he's... I think he's here for us. He's your friend? He was... he was my spotter during the war. He'd pick the targets, and I'd drop 'em. So, yeah... Bush plums. - Good bush tucker. - Hmm. Got used to this during the war. I'll save that for later. Here. I thought the war was over. Mmm. - Hmm - My uncle Baywara... he was my teacher. I think if he had a chance, he'd be a different kind of man. I'm not sure anyone gets to choose what kind of man they're gonna be. Fuck off! Oh... shit. You can smell that shit for miles. How did you survive so long out here? Wit. I reckon they're up and about. They're on the move. So? So, it doesn't make sense, just hanging back here... - for your mate. - He's not my mate. Then why are you so scared of catching up with him then, eh? You ever see him shoot? Y-y-yeah. My point exactly. Ah, I reckon I'm gonna take a piss. There are many ways to look at a situation, Walter. Yeah? One way is your way. The blackfella way. Which, in my opinion, is reckless and lacking in precision. As an ex-military man, I believe precision is the key. Sure, we can rely on your blackfella mumbo jumbo some of the time. But at the point of engagement, at the moment of contact... nothin' gets the job done like sound military planning. Travis. Walter. Where's Tommy? Tommy, I know you're out there. You show your face or he's dead. He doesn't care, Eddy. Tommy! You're not up for this. What the fuck are you doin'? Moran says no one comes back. Step right. Fuckin' black prick. When you get back, you tell Moran the plan's changed. From now on, I'll do things my way. And why the fuck would you do that? Because you're not exactly here to watch my back, are you? I don't want to have to shoot you again, Walter. So just piss off back to Queensland. - You watch him. - Come on. Drop it, Eddy. Put it down, Eddy. Drop it. Take his gun. Keep your eyes on him. I got him. He's no trouble. He's old and slow. Short and fat. He has hair like a woman. Are we goin' back out there? We goin' back out there? I'm waitin' on more men. Waitin' on more men. When do they get here? You know, in the war... you didn't do any of the shootin' yourself. You know what a spotter does? You don't just find the target. You confirm the kill. You watch as the head explodes. You see a mist of blood, and dead eyes. The thing you need to remember, Walter... is that Travis is the nice one. Gutjuk, you did well. You're finished with the mission. Your life starts now. Yes. Okay. Where are we going? Your grandfather's country. What are you going to do with him? I think he's a good man. Don't worry. If I wanted your friend dead I would have killed him back there. Is she your woman? She's nobody's. Too wild, that one. Your son's mob are coming. Is that your grandson? There's a white man. Why did you bring him here? We can use him to bargain. I don't want anything to do with this. Father, you said if I was in trouble you would help me. Not when you do something like this. Then let's cut him to pieces. No. This madness stops now. Take me to him. Sounds like you boys are in trouble. Shut up. You've got a big nose. I don't care. I just want him dead. My grandfather wants to know if you got any power. He's your grandfather? Yes. What is it that he wants? He says it's up to him to judge his son. Not you. His son's mob killed a woman. He's not giving you his son. Then he's putting his whole family in danger. But if he come with you, will his family be safe? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. He wants to talk to your boss. Okay. Yeah, I can do that. I'm gonna need my gun back. Give him back his gun. I don't like this idea. You can't trust them. You know what they did. I want you to look after this place. We need to make peace. You're going to get him killed. You understand? You're a mission boy pretending to be a man. You don't know what you're doing. You're weak. You're all weak. Cowards. Cowards who talk when they should fight. You're going on the word of a white man? And a mission boy? You don't speak for me. - Careful with that. - Yes, sir. I hear you've got no takers. Everyone's too scared to let their men go with this mob on the loose. Is there anything else I can do? I mean, I've had rifle training and I did two months outside Alice Springs. Rifle training? Okay. All right, I'll tell you what you can do. Go in there and grab a rifle, head out about a mile east, and you be our early warning. - Like an eagle. - I can do that. Nephew. All right, everyone looking directly at the camera. Don't move. Looking directly at the camera. Hold still. Now! One more for safety. What have you bloody done? I speak some of your language, so I can translate for you. Are you the woman who raised my grandson? My brother and I. Thank you. But my grandson can speak for me. Do you see this crown on the badge? That represents the king. The king of the British Empire. And that is the law that I am duty-bound to uphold. See the shiny thing on his hat? Makes him think he's boss. My grandfather. He's here to negotiate about my uncle, Baywara. I didn't come here to negotiate. Listen... your uncle has broken the law. He wants to know what law you're talking about. What? This is my law. It come from the soil. From Mother Earth. You have come from across the sea. My law is perfect. Consistent. It make us one. Baywara is his son. He's to judge, not youse. Makarrata. Restore balance. I understand "balance". - But in this country... - My country! In this country... we all abide by the same laws. Now, I will do my best to see that your son, Baywara, is treated fairly. That's justice. Do you stand for justice? Absolutely. Then you give us our justice... for the man who killed my family. This didn't start with my uncle. This started with you. You want us to respect your law? Give us our justice. Listen... I'm not a politician. I'm simply an officer of the law. What you're asking for is not my decision. There are people I need to talk to... to convince. Do you understand? And bringing in your son... will help me to do that. They just hit Kurtz's station. Two dead. Your bloody son and his mob just hit another station. - Baywara just attacked another station. - We're done here. Bloody hell! We all have to go. We need to look after our own. We have to find Baywara and warn him. No. He's brought this on himself. Families come. We go home now. We need to look after the land, ourselves and our children. Trouble is coming. If all goes well, you won't see me again. German? That's the Mauser G98. Yeah, they reckon they were much better than ours. - Light weight... - Piss off! Moran's letting you go? Yeah. It's more like a head-start. They can't pin it on me if I'm locked up here, can they? You know what they're going to do. And you're just gonna let it happen. But I'm not gonna make it easy for 'em. I took the preacher's old gun. Be careful. Where are the others, bitch? - Look, give it a rest, will ya? - Stupid bitch. Morley! - Morley, for Christ's sake! - What? Steady on, boy. I know you. You're one of them mission coons. Tommy. That's his name. What are you doin' pointing a gun on a whitefella, Tommy? I can't even wipe my arse without you blokes... argh. Don't watch. No, please, please... argh. I don't want their water. You pretending to know what you're doing? You stay on the high ground, you see everything. You think like a white man. These were good men. You got 'em? Yeah. This is where they killed my family. Baywara, we can't wait for her any longer. We wait. She's one of us. How many are coming? Maybe four. Let them come. They send men and we'll send them back ghosts. No. If we fight them when they're ready we lose. We need to run and make a plan. We need to have control. You don't tell me what to do. Listen to him. What have you got to say? That man, Travis. He was a soldier. He told me control is everything. Okay. And he taught me this. Are you a crazy child? What are you doing? I'm just explaining to him. You think you know everything? Twelve years, and the one thing I learned for sure, about the men who killed my family. They were soldiers. Understand? Travis! Hey! You're finished. Come here. It was you! We're gonna talk about your choices, mate. I reckon that says it all. People will look at that photo... and they'll think, "That's what a mad dog looks like when he's laid low." You know how a civilisation's built, son? Bad men. Bad men doing bad things. Clearing the way for the others to follow. Bad men like me and you. Whatever made you think you could change who you are? You break my heart, son. Rest up. Get your strength back. We wouldn't look too clever trying to hang a dead man. Would we? Are you going to follow your uncle's path? This stone. This stone is the spearhead. It is the rule of law. It cannot be undone. Hardest stone there is. I want this spear. No, this is mine. Baywara could've been our greatest teacher. But he lost all that to his anger. Understand? We didn't help him. You need to listen to the wind. Listen to Father Sky. Listen to Mother Earth. To what she is telling you. Walk softly. Stay here. Protect yourself. You can't follow your uncle's path. I used to work at a station. I cooked food and cleaned the floor. Boss man thought he owned me. I was a girl... just a little girl. I told my family. He killed them all. He gave me to his men. I know how it feels to be beaten. To feel like nothing. That's why you have to stay angry and keep fighting. Your anger is all you have. He's dead, isn't he? If he was, they wouldn't be back here trying to gather up more men. Don't worry. He's not gonna wait for them to come to him. Claire. You going after Tommy? He's a murderer. To finish the job you started twelve years ago. You can't share a country, Claire. People way over there. Fires burning. See them? They might be police. - Let's go to them. - Yes, let's go. Let's go down, see where those fellas are sitting. Good morning. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Bullets. Throw them on the fire. Fuck! Jesus! They're here! They're here! The mob's here! The supplies! Kill 'em all! - Uncle Brett, Uncle Brett! - Go. Get inside! Keep a watch on Travis. - Where are you going? - I'm going with them. Not a good idea, John. Make sure you get all the bastards this time. Keep your eyes open. Son, you'll see some action soon enough. It's not fair. No! - Bruce! - Don't move, old man. Stop, or I'll drop him. Get your gun down. Hurry up. On your knees. Tommy. Where's Travis? Eddy! This bloody lunatic! Take cover! Fuck! - Come on. - Tommy! What are you doing? Put the gun down. - And you. - They shoot you. You're making a big mistake, son. You lied! You know who these men are. Son... What they did to my family. I am the second most senior officer... Shut up! - Please, Tommy. - My name is Gutjuk. You killed my family. Say it! You don't wanna do this, mate. Son... - you need to calm down. - Shut up old man. Finally! Easy. Think calm. Say goodbye, you black bast... You. Leave. Travis! No, Eddy. - Leave it! - Drop it, Eddy. You give it up, Travis. If you shoot me, I'll shoot him. What makes you think I won't drop you right now? Look at you! You care more about this black piece of shit than you do about yourself! God knows why? Put it down! - Don't! - Shut up. On your knees. You gotta go. Gutjuk. Gutjuk. You have to go.
