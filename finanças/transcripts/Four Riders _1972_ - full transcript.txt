Colonel... As from today I'm not in the Army anymore and that means you're not my boss now. What's this about? I wouldn't know. But still, it's been a long war. They've got to fight somebody. Break it up. Now be good kids... Bye bye. Goodbye... Good fella! You speak Chinese? I'm Chinese. Or do you think I should speak in French? Great, you're heading to Seoul? The war's over, it's time to relax in Seoul. How much pension do you get? Not much, but it will support me for quite a while. Not bad at all. I'm Feng Xia. Combat instructor in the troop. Gao Yinhan, Combat Engineer, specialised in explosives. I hear Seoul has grown more prosperous during the war, it's even interesting than Hong Kong or Tokyo. Everywhere is paradise as long as you have money. Don't be so sure, I stole this jeep. If the military police are here, you'll be in trouble. Well, who cares! The war is over. Step on it. I dream about going to Seoul all the time. More? Don't be so nervous, you've been discharged and are returning home anyone bringing two suits won't be checked out I've changed my mind. I want to set up a little business when I get home, and I don't want to land in jail. Alright then, it's all up to you we won't force you to do it. Thanks. That Jin guy is here again. Wonder what's up! For war veterans, they won't rest until they've spent every single dime. With the way they spend, it wouldn't last even they have gold mines. Go look outside again. I'm sure someone loves money out there. We've imported a large load of drugs from Japan, and will get the soldiers to bring them to U.S. Got it. Don't go. Let go of me. Stop making a scene here. Don't! You should go now. Where to? It's not our problem. He's drunk. He's only drunk. What do you want? I'll pay for whatever he's broken. He's only drunk. He's a drunk, you don't need to beat him up. He's not drunk. After their time in the army, these kind of people are unsure of their future. They are just like the rats without hole. I've seen so many of those. What has he done? He'll be back for you. Am I right? Twenty dollars for a jeep? It's not my car anyway. I'd have sold it even for two dollars. It's fun to hang out with you. Where are you going? Visiting a friend in the hospital. He's wounded and has been staying in the hospital. Alright then, it's goodbye for us. Could you give me an address? Are you kidding me? Do you think I would have an address? Who knows where I'll be tomorrow. Hospital. Meal time. Why do you always listen to this kind of sad music? Wait, listen along for a while. You've read the Bible? Do you know about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse? And I saw, and beheld a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth. And that they should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword. And then I beheld a black horse to my amazement, and he that sat on him carried scales of vengeance. But then I looked, and beheld a pale horse. And he that sat on him... his name was death. And Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over one 4th of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, & with death, and with the beasts of the earth. You don't like it? Not that. I just don't wanna bring it up. You like it, I know you do. First Lieutenant Li. I tried to look for you at the military hospital. Who would have thought that you're here! Call me Li Weishi, and you're not Sergeant Gao. I'm no longer First Lieutenant Li. You are... I retired from the army two months ago. We were the first batch of WIA (wounded in action). You look stronger than me. Why are you still in the hospital? I get it. To charm the nurses? That's why you wouldn't leave. It's time to eat. She speaks good Chinese. Sorry, I thought she doesn't know Chinese. But you're right. I must see her at least once a day. Four against one, that's not fair. I don't want to get into trouble, forget it. I said forget it. I said forget it, but you wouldn't leave it at that. Forget it... Call the police, someone beat an American G.I to death. What's going on? There are prisoners' wards in the hospital. I didn't kill anyone, you've got the wrong guy. Feng Xia. Gao Yinhan. I know this guy. What's going on? I mean it was only a lousy old jeep. What jeep? We've got him for murder. Get back. I didn't kill anyone, Gao Yinhan. He's the one I told you before, the friend I bumped into on the road. Boss, that Jin guy is here for Wensi again. Right outside. You want to see me. Speak, what do you want? Whisky. You won't invite me inside? Come on in if you're not scared. No trouble now, you'll get hurt. Well, what touching concern. Bravo... What is it? I've one thing to ask you. Why did you get Feng to be the scapegoat? He's my friend. Using Yankee soldiers to smuggle things is one thing but it's different when it involves my friend. No one forced him. Get one of your men to take the blame for the murder. I want Feng Xia to return without a scratch. You know what? I hate you. You really are a rat. I'll take your bones out and break them one by one. You think you can do that with your injured arm? Ask Lei Tai to come on up. Yes. Forget it. Let them finish their fight first. Yinhua, you're here too. Hawkes is here, he's waiting for you upstairs. What should I do with him? I'll take care of it. I can't believe someone's fighting Lei Tai. Mr Hawkes. You know, I don't like this kind of news. But, sir. The guy took our money & wanted to quit, what else can we do? We're lucky we found a scapegoat. What's the matter with you? Can't you tell someone's taking up his cause. I want to see the man tomorrow, you arrange it. What for? We can finish him off as well. Kill this one first. You should know you're the best man to handle it. So, find someone, pay some money, but get the job done. You get back. What's wrong? He's a tough guy, eh? I think the fellow's dangerous, and I think you should put extra guards on him. I'm innocent. Let me go. I never killed him. I didn't do it. Shut up. A tough one for sure. You're right. We're going to have to put a special detail on him around the clock. You better see to it. Right. What to do? There's no way to save him. Don't forget, he's a murderer. It's all reported in the newspaper. Not even the best defense attorney could help him. I trust that he's no murderer. He was framed. You really think so? Yes. You need to find a gun. I can convince Song Hua to get it to him. What's the use of a gun? Oh, plenty. Fine, I'll think of something. I hope I can buy one. If I can't... That's what I need. Stand still. What's the use of a fake gun? You need a real gun. You have one? Wait. What? You want a gun? What for? Fine, I'll get you a gun, and US$1000. US$1000? But I need you to do something. You won't be afraid to kill if you're asking for a gun. I need you to kill someone. Who? Him. You can kill him anywhere you like. But get it done before the trial, understand? The gun? You don't seem to worry about the money. Didn't we have a deal? Where's the gun? Go to the train station tomorrow afternoon, someone will meet you there. No, I want it now. Don't be rash, kid. It will get you nowhere. On your word I hope we can work well together. Keep an eye on this kid from now on. Yes. Your stuff is in the locker, get it. Song Hua, forget what we talked about last night. No! If your friend didn't kill anyone, then you should help him. We can't do it. Gao Yinhan has been gone for the whole night. Don't worry. He took me as a hostage and fled. Why would he hurt me? I really shouldn't get her to do this kind of work. I've a lead, I know who framed Feng Xia. As long as Feng Xia comes forward, I'm sure we can find out the truth about this. Someone gave me this gun and US$1000 to get rid of Feng Xia. They worry for themselves if Feng Xia speaks up. Why don't they do it themselves? You've got yourself into a mess, a real mess. No matter if you kill Feng Xia or not, do you think they will let you get away? Get back... I'll kill her. Get out my way... Just keep back. Go on... Quick... Song Hua. Let's go... Now on the question of the dead G.I. It seems he was in with a narcotic smuggling joint as a principal or just as a carrier that we don't know... But it's certain that his killer's from the same gang and so are the two guys who helped him escape. We must get them. And undoubtedly after I've sealed off the city they can't get out. When we get them, we might get the whole organisation. And that's what I'm aiming for. Boss Hawkes. The boss said you fought Lei Tai last time, you did a pretty good job. I've taught boxing to thousands of soldiers. I would have won last night, if he didn't get any help. I would have killed him already. If you're so brave, then why run when you see me? Forgive me. I'm not used to facing naked women. Boss Hawkes said you often meddle in others' business. Feng is your friend; If you would leave it alone, Boss Hawkes will pay you, a lot. How much? You can have the bar. You couldn't save your friend anyway. He's dead. You lot... Stupid. Who told you to shoot? He ran away. Leave now! Hey... Who are they? Just get lost. Stop! Stop it! Let him. Beat me up instead! Go on! Song Hua's dead, I'd beat myself up anyway even if you won't. Don't mention Song Hua again! You should cry. Go on. I would cry too if my lover's dead. Jin Yi, it's you. Why are you so reckless? All the military police are looking for you. How did you know we're here? He knew we'd come here first. We slept in these tubes when we were in Seoul. I know you got set up which is why I took the initiative. I tried to look for evidence that will help you, but I almost got killed myself. Though no one comes here usually, but it's possible that the military police might come here. Don't worry, this is my friend. Why is he crying? His lover is dead because of me. Find another one, why cry? You can't say that. What is all this? Stay with us, stay with us. Go hide in the cement tubes. I'll try to get you out when it's dark. Don't run off somewhere. There are checkpoints everywhere. You don't have a chance. Alright. Seen anything? Nothing. Lei Tai, again you made the news, the kind I don't like. What happened to Jin? Had I been there, he could never have escaped. Boss, the police are looking for the three men. You lot all go out to find Jin Yi. With the war just over, the whole city is in a mess. It's a perfect chance for us to get rich. We can be rich. Very rich. Hello. Wensi? For you. Me? Hello. I need your help, listen up. I need four girls, including you and four sets of army uniforms. You must get it. Good question, but I can't get help. No one could help me. That's why I came to you. I'll wait for you at the corner. Where are you going? Hey baby, come on. You want to play games? Where are you? Come... Baby, where are you? What the heck! That's it. Yeah, lots of girls. I got everything you asked for. Hop in. Alright. Hurry up. The lucky dogs. Bring out the wine to celebrate! Bring out the wine! There's nothing to celebrate about, just go. No, you're trying to kick us out? We're staying here tonight. Xiao Gao, are you shy? I... I what? Bye. We want to see the manager. Hurry up. Where's Wensi and the rest? Who knows! Never mind, just enjoy yourselves. Our stripper queen is here. From how it looks, you must need cash now. The money you spent on me, I haven't used a dime, here you go. No, that's the money you sold yourself for. You... I can sell myself to anyone, except you. Wensi, what did you steal a military uniform for? Just for fun. Must be more than that. Someone spotted the four of you sneaking into Jin Yi's car last night, right? So what? What is it to you? Where's Jin Yi? Did you see? Speak up, where's Jin Yi? Fine, we'll tell you. Stop drinking! Think about what we should do. Look for them! Then we can hand Lei Tai to the military and their whole syndicate will fall apart. And we may get a reward. How would you spend it in jail? Stay. Leave me alone! I want to drink. Shut up! Leave me alone! They come for us even though we didn't go find them. Go get them. They are here, come on, let's move. Give me a gun. I lost it. It's no use anyway. We're in danger when the military police is here. Then... The bar seems to be their gathering point. Lei Tai and his men are all here. We want you to stay here, and try to buy some time. I'll leave from the back, look inside the bar. If we can find any evidence for the military, then... Weishi... Hurry! Wensi. Yin Hua, you're crazy! Xiao Gao. Jin Yi. I got the evidence. Jin Yi, you've been hurt. But I've killed Hawkes. They've got guns
