The greatest things in human life, every effort to think, every effort to love, are destructive for order. I can't be bothered, you can switch off the TV. When's the next demo? I can't remember. I hope there'll be one soon. Like the one the day before yesterday. I was happy with that one. They're asking: "Who benefits from the drop in unemployment?" The unemployed, I hope. Darling... Good night, Monique. Good night, my sweetheart. Until tomorrow. Until tomorrow. With all your courage. When you wake up in the morning do you think of the millions of people who die of hunger? Do you think of those children? Of the starving Burkinabe? No. You think about the day ahead or the dress you want to buy! Well, it's the same with the upper class. You don't exist! Do you understand what I mean? You got it all! Michel tells me that the trickle-down theory is nonsense. That's exactly it. It's like the story of Jesus who was born without the Virgin Mary touching Joseph, or like the invisible hand of the market. There are lots of childish tales how people can believe such things? I shouldn't talk like this, but they're taking the piss out of us. And today more than ever, the only solution is a Revolution. A GUIDE TO LOVE AND FIGHTING CAPITALISM - What shops do you see? - Nina Ricci, Dior. - Luxury shops. - Look around. It's intimidating. What are you doing, exactly? We're taking a walk around the neighbourhood. - Why? - It's a school trip. I see. Goodbye, sir. You find it oppressive? Let's go. The prime minister's offices aren't here. Matignon is just the street name. - The Élysée Palace isn't far? - It's a bit further. Mind your manners, please. Look how she's dressed! No pointing, Nadir, please. Haven't you heard of brunch? It's when you get up late on Sundays. You can do cheaper ones. Plastic sandals at 450. There are harem pants at 1,370. I get that in a month as a cashier. 700. My dad's monthly pay. Hold on, Farid. I'm getting a piece of gold. I'll sell it. Thank you very much for coming. You must have loved working in this area. That's not quite how it was. In reality, we were a bit intimated. In the words of Pierre Bourdieu, we sociologists call that timidity "symbolic violence". It means that when you see... Especially me as I'm very small with an unusual look, faced with the lithe, elegant ladies of Avenue Montaigne... - You're more beautiful! - Thank you. That's sweet. Alongside those ladies, I didn't feel good. They're no better than you or me. They were just in the right place at the right time, and that allowed them to study and enter the workforce. They're taught to exhibit the right behaviour. They speak nicely. Not because they're more intelligent. It's never that. They simply do exactly as expected. It's normal for them to see children's dresses at 700. Whereas we're shocked because we don't have that. I find their lives weird. For them, it's normal but I find it weird. It's a whole different world. Two different worlds. They don't want to know us. When we said hello to the people outside the palace hotels they looked down on us. They're scornful. They don't want to know us. The higher up in society you are, the more your bearing is elegant, and you stand straight. So you think it's normal that such a person is dominant, or gives the orders. It's normal that those people are in politics and lead the world as we can see that they are better than us. The violence that you felt is the start of resistance, the start of your critical thinking. It's important to feel in your flesh this confrontation with those who dominate. What you came up against was domination, class domination. It's madness to say this but something has taken place in your minds, that is irreversible. Never be submissive. Always stand straight. Vertical. That's why we don't want you to sit. Not because of the dog shit but so we all remain standing straight. Thank you, very much. We look great, like that! Look at today's "Le Monde"! It's the same nonsense every day! It's extraordinary. Here's the front page on Carlos Ghosn, "The Tax Evader". The bastard, I didn't know about the embezzlement. He used Nissan to buy land in Brazil and Lebanon to protect his future. Maybe to speculate? Look! "H ow will climatic chaos affect our lives?" "By the year 2100, half of humanity will be threatened by massive simultaneous catastrophes. Drought, famine, floods!" That's jolly! And so? That's everything we're up against. You see. "In CAR, a militia leader has been brought before the ICC." When can we bring Macron before the ICC for insulting the workers. - Have you been drinking? - No, I haven't. I saw we had a lot of bills! I kept you the gardening flyer as you like to look at the plants. Do you want a spot more wine? We'll just say you've deserved it! And she serves herself, again! You eat like a peasant from the Ardennes. It reminds me of when your parents were invited to my parents' home in the nice house in Élancourt. Mum had prepared sole. You dad started cutting up his sole instead of filleting it. Like that. I thought: "He'll eat the bones". It was a moment of symbolic violence, class violence. So I filleted it for him. For me, it was even more violent that my father, a magistrate, spoke to you to ask if your father or mother liked something. My father didn't speak directly to your parents. It was incredibly disdainful. He was incapable of having an ordinary exchange with a labourer and a cleaning lady. But Mother wouldn't have spoke like that. That means that class violence can be found in the smallest details. Smallest details yourself. If I may say so! It's the morning mood with the head of Radio France politics. Who are these people President Macron called lazy? We'd like to know who he considers lazy, cynical, extreme. We're not sure whether he means people or forces. It needs to be put elsewhere. Don't tell me you're working! What else should I do? "Needs and Habitus". Remember? Social housing. There were two volumes. It was one of our favourite books that we wrote together. Especially as we took pleasure in writing it. I'll never forget the two letters that Guy de Rothschild sent us to congratulate us for our work. It was a good idea to accept that job which followed a family from the 18th century to 1999. We understood how fortunes are consolidated by these internal marriages between members of the same family. Of the 19 grandchildren of Amschel Rothschild, the dynasty's supposed founder, how many of them intermarried? I can't remember. Fourteen of them. That's a lot. They're listed in here. I'll give it my full attention, later. It'll be my bedtime read, tonight. I think I made a big mistake live on a 24-hour news channel on the subject of flat tax. I said that the capital gains tax has decreased from 60% to 30%. I'd read somewhere that it included all the social charges, so, I said if I take off 17.2% of social charges, it's a lie because capital gains taxation has dropped from 60 to 12.8%. The 12.8% is exclusive of social charges. In fact, they've created an income tax specifically for the rich. A flat-tax at 12.8%. - So I'm not wrong? - No, you're not wrong. This is very important. You need to go slower. We have to understand and be able to explain. Most of the income of the richest people, meaning the 500 richest families in France, comes from capital income, not salary income, but from interest or dividends, linked to the sale of their shares. So now they're taxed at 12.8%, instead of 45%. Of course, if you add on social charges, that makes a total of 30%. But if you add on social charges to 45%, that makes a total of 60%. So they say from 60% to 30%, because 60% seems enormous and 30% seems reasonable, whereas if you said 12.8%, there'd be a revolution. Whilst the first tax bracket for the man on the street is 14%. Income tax is applied to flow. What happens if you only apply a 12.8% flat-tax? It means there's a lot less tax on flow. So it will increase stock even more. That's why I'll add a third line. See, the flow is much more consequent. So stock will increase! It increases if the rich make it increase. Because if they consume it all, it doesn't grow. But they can't. If they consume more, they'll burst! Mrs Bettencourt has 81 million in taxable income. She doesn't use 81 million yearly. Half is a hell of a lifestyle, already. So she will always have at least half of that 81 million that will increase stock. Do you know what, Liêm? Thanks to Laurent Fabius, in 1999, we got access to the 100 richest payers of wealth tax. He was Minister for Economic Affairs and we were quite friendly with him. We asked him to ask the Inland Revenue to do a special job at our request. The results of this research? Financial products made up 97% of their personal wealth. The remaining 3% allowed them to buy yachts, castles, flats... Their income is 500 to 1,000 times minimum wage. People don't realise. The "poor" have never seen real rich people. They don't know what they have. They think that the rich drive Ferraris. It's a far cry from reality. And now, can you explain the transition from Employment and Competitivity Tax Credit... To long-term social charge decrease? I think that's important. This year, that will cost 40 billion. 20 billion in tax credit and 20 billion in social charges. That's 40 billion. That's 2 points of GDP. It's a huge sum. Ok. Raising minimum welfare to the poverty line would cost 10 billion. That's very well said. If we put welfare up to 1,000, that would cost 10 billion. Instead, companies get a 40 billion gift. How can you smile when you say that? It's horrendous. Sometimes, I detest you. It's horrible. Better laugh than cry! We're off to a bad start. It'll take time to bring change. It just upsets me. It shows to what extent we're in a democracy that's decaying. It will be awful. It will be awful. Carlos Ghosn did not commit tax fraud in France. The Government spokesperson and I have asked our services to check Mr Carlos Ghosn's tax situation in France. I just wish to confirm that there's nothing to report as regards Mr Carlos Ghosn's tax situation. So, no fraud in France... I'm a journalist at Le Soir newspaper in Brussels. We'd like to invite you to participate in our debate. The main question will be: Why is it that the richer you are the more you fraud? They refuse to pay their taxes but it's not to save money, at all. It's because they don't believe in national solidarity and welfare states. They want multinationals to be free like foxes in a chicken coup. They don't want them to come up against obstacles represented by politics, democracy or nation-states. That's it. The oligarchs, all those who monopolise wealth and power, they recognise only one homeland: their own social class. In the name of the revolution and a brighter future! - Happy Humanity Festival. - Yes, you too. From the plains to forests and vales to hills From spring to be born from the seasons gone by From what I lived to what I imagine I shall never finish writing your song My France From the great summer sun that scorches Provence You're as hard-working as ever. From Brittany's broom to the heather of Ardèche Something in the air has that transparency And taste of happiness that dries my lips That air of freedom beyond the frontiers Those foreign peoples who made us feel giddy Whose dignity you steal today It still answers to the name of Robespierre That of old Hugo railing from exile Of the 5-year old children working the mines Those who with their hands build your factories Those of whom Mr Thiers said we shall shoot it Picasso holds the world at the tip of his palette Doves fly out from Éluard's lips Your prophetic artists continually warn It's time for misfortune to die The voices of the throng ring out as one The throng that pays for the crimes of your errors Filling history and its communal graves I shall always sing of the workers' land. The international ideal unites the human race! "This trickle-down manipulation is a partial explanation of the extent of abstention, of the distrust vis a vis politicians, of their expertise..." I've finished, Michel! I have to correct it. I dictated it. And sometimes, the machine improvises. There are 3 quotas... There's sex... It put "sexy aged"... I'll correct it. I'd dictated "sex and age"... - How do I do it. - Put the cursor there. Just type that first... I'm doing it as you watch. See what happens? You do it. It works one day out of two. You're not doing it better than me. It's pointless getting annoyed. It'll work tomorrow. - How strange. - It's working! Well done. How did you do that. I held that key down. You learn something every day. You're retired but continue your research? Yes. I'm a bit reluctant. A big bit! You'd rather travel the world? Why not? - Have you travelled a lot? - Yes, a bit. We'd like to travel more but we made a promise to do this work. We often hear the same names in left-wing circles. There's yours, Ruffin, Serge Halimi, Pierre Carles, - You're very up to date. - Bourdieu. It's an honour to travel with you. What's your profession? I'm a prison officer. Oh yes, at the prison, nearby. Not many of my colleagues are left-wing. I'm a bit of an outsider. My colleagues laugh at me. "As a civil servant, you are not allowed to have an opinion." As if they don't have an ideology. If you talk too much to a prisoner, as I sometimes do, "Lefty's talking again. You're not here to chat." "Isn't reinsertion part of my job?" "Reinsertion, stop dreaming." They show fatalism. They don't want to try to understand. There's no sociology. They call them "profiteers". It's the poor who are costly. You probably hear that. All the time! Let's open the suitcase. We'll be happy to have our slippers handy. Look what I bought. - I saw it before. - I got it for on television. - It wasn't for me? - What? I said it wasn't for me. You don't look at me. I hear you! Is it possible for an oppressed and disorganised class, to come to power? Is it possible? It makes you wonder. I say yes. We all want to say yes. History hasn't yet proven it's possible. History has shown that the old aristocratic regime's disappearance gave rise to the new aristocracy of money. We got rid of the aristocrats. - But we created a new aristocracy. - So we have to kick them out, too. They don't feel any guilt. None at all. They don't feel any guilt whatsoever. With the work we did on the dominant class, we know the strength represented by sharing that wealth and power within a very small number of families. As we share things in all those dinner parties, hunting parties, closed circles and rallies, we've really understood how things work. It's never Michel who gives you a hand and you, Philippe Poutou who will give Michel a hand. No. A helps B. Then B helps C, who will help D. And in the end... It all comes together. It all gels. As if it had been thought out. Everything passes through this worldly interaction, that we had permission to be a part of. It's every day. You start with breakfast in a palace hotel, then have lunch in a great restaurant on the Place des Vosges, where you have a private salon, and you finish with coffee at the Jockey Club. In another private salon. Then it's tea-time for the ladies at Ladurée, with little macarons. Then it's cocktails and dinner. The pleasure of being together. And I'm going to shock you and ruin your evening for good. Because happiness and communism... They apply it? Oh, it's just too hard. We trade unionists are suffering at the factory. What were the consequences of the threats? The employees went back to work. It didn't last long. They heard the word "punishment". I said to my big boss, discipline me now. I know I'm in for it. If everyone stops, he can't discipline everyone. The problem is that only a small number stop. And they face disciplinary measures. It's lucky our team's there. We cause a lot of trouble, but we take a lot of stick too. But you're happy! Yes, like I said... I won't die on my knees. My wife says the union is my secret mistress. She's even jealous. Michel and I are sociologists. For over thirty years, we were researchers at the National Scientific Research Centre. That means that you, the taxpayers, paid us to carry out fundamental research, which means discovering new research subjects, to discover interesting things about society. Our research into those in high places aimed to incarnate or to personify the exploiters, and understand how as an ultra-minority they manage to enslave the majority. This discrimination has to be masked or made to appear natural like the moon that shines or the sun that warms us. So self-evident that it can't be contested. I shall add my part to that stellar account. I shall do my very best. First of all, I'd like to try to say that almost everywhere in the world the rich lead a struggle against the people. The weapons used are more subtle than canons and guns. They are ideological weapons. Workers are considered as adjustable variables. Costs and expenses... You begin to see the difference, I suppose? The difference between my darling wife and I? She writes like a potato. My speech is even worse than her writing style. So, as Ford prepares to lay off 910 employees from your factory, the American multinational is declaring 6,000 euros is that thousand, or million, or billion perhaps? That's impossible. Is that right? Well, I just can't believe it. I wrote it but it's unbelievable. 6.37 billion in profits. I'll help you. We'll do it together. That's the final point. What should you do? You, the Ford workers? You must do what the rich do, support each other. So, today, we shall give nothing to the lazy, the cynical, and the extremists of the predatory oligarchy. United we stand! United we stand! I'm going to sing you a song. After "Your Precious Hands", I will sing to you a new song, called "Hope". Perhaps hope will fit in with what's going to happen. That will all depend on the conviction of the fight. I promised Mr Poutou I'd come back if you occupied the factory. I'm used to riot police lines. You have to fight to the end. On the darkness of the sun, on the sand of the tides. On the calm of sleep, on my love found again. The sun also rises. And the stronger the heat, The more you believe in life, The more pain is erased. And if hope returned You would never believe me Secretly In passionate love With all your strength Go the full length And if hope returned Is there a right side? Yes, it's embroidered. I hope it's not stained. Oh look. I'm so happy. I don't know if the champagne glass goes to the left or right. We're a bit stressed. I'd have preferred him to invite us to his castle. Everything will be fine. I don't really agree with you on the topic of abortion. There's something that living people don't think about. What if I'd been conceived and my parents had decided to abort. - Don't be afraid, Denis! - But I am. Me too. Shall I do that? I'm a bit of an expert. I think Denis would be reassured! I have years of practice. Thank you for coming! You think I benefit from an extremely favourable regime, that you criticise. We criticise it but accept that the interested parties do not. What I believe we have in common, is that in our intellectual environment we are considered iconoclasts as are you, in your environment. I believe we have that in common. We are capable of being critical of various subjects that we discuss together. We realise that reality isn't binary. We can talk. Even if we don't agree. You remember when we spoke previously that I said you'd become very radical compared to when I met you. At the time when you were the specialists in castle owners, you were more benevolent. Then, when you published "Sarkozy, President of the Rich", you became quite virulent. It was no more laughing matter. I suggested you might moderate your comments. Not all the rich are the same. There can be huge wealth gaps. And differences in behaviour. And you simply dismissed that, saying there was too much misery. So there was this wholesale rejection. In 2006, with your help, we wrote "The Ghettos of Gotha". Denis De Kergolay in the book's conclusion! It was our honeymoon period. We got on very well. And in 2007, we retired. We were no longer bound to discretion by our jobs. We're getting towards the answer. So you could let rip. No, it's just that we wanted a full vision of a social class. We'd analysed the dominant class with its lifestyle, the hunting parties, the castles... - The hunters were very happy. - They were delighted! Afterwards, in "Castles and Chatelains", you weren't happy about everything as there was a part about the castle's tax. But you said, fair enough let's put the past behind us! I wasn't horrified enough to think "I couldn't have anything to do with them." I would say that these political issues in France that bring this considerable climate of discontent, are a real source of concern. For us, for the country. - For us all. - Yes, for us all. I would appreciate if people could talk to each other. Where are you heading back to, Denis? I'm staying in Paris. I'm heading home. We'll see you soon and keep in touch. We'll keep each other posted. If he scratches that car we'll be in trouble! You look well. - You always sleep well. - What happened? I slept badly. Don't drop them on the floor. You're dropping them on the floor. That's abundance, wealth. You don't care. You can drop stuff everywhere. You're not the woman who cleans up. You're going to squash them. No, I want to eat them. Monique, what shall we do until we leave? What sort of question is that? You can tidy the kitchen, mow the lawn. You can sweep up, clean the windows, and varnish all the shutters. Macron resign! Macron resign! Riot police, on our side! Riot police, on our side! What happened? The traffic lights have been knocked down. I like this. They're very pretty. We're ordinary people. They can talk to us, calmly and simply. Nothing is coherent. Even ecological transition. We're told to do this or that. Then you've got all the people who pay less carbon taxes than me while they've got private jets and yachts. There's no tax on jet fuel or ocean liners. The cops will push us up and down, all day long. I'm lost. Whether it's politics or unions. Like many here, I'm lost. For me, this movement is the result of Macron's total and constant disregard for us. Whether it's "diesel with fags in your mouth", or "cross the road and you'll find work". "You just need to buy a 15,000 euro suit." I'm from a working class family in the north of France. My dad's a labourer. My mum's a cleaner. They've worked like slaves. I had my first holiday at 13. I come from a very big family. I know what dignity means. They were exploited but they had their dignity. It's my first demo. The people here are ordinary people. We're ordinary citizens. We need to repeat "normal". Because when you don't want to face what's happening, others aren't normal! I'm not the biggest fan. I'm a sociologist, so that interests me. It's a good cause but the methods are too violent.. It's a good cause. So, that means you share... Don't worry, it's anonymous. Careful! Here are the water cannons. We'll see you another time! If we go to one side we'll get hit less! We agreed, Michel. If I die here, I'll be furious. Where is my Michel? It looks like the riot police are leaving. Cunts! If everyone is here France is united. Who are you? What job do you do? I drive a fork lift. - How much do you earn? - 1,100. Barely minimum wage. - You can't live on that? - No. Not at all. I've got three children. That's why I'm here. They're there. They've started eating. Wealth tax for the bourgeois! Wealth tax for the bourgeois! Don't look any further. That's where your taxes are. Are we disturbing you, rich people? You don't want to see poverty. They'd better hide if they don't want to see poverty. Oh, that'll look good on "Faceberk". You can't ask them to contribute to a collective effort. They're so wrapped up in their silver tower and selfishness. We don't count the same way. We count to make it to month end. They count to make more. We care about what goes on around us. They're not bothered. It's not their problem. They just want to keep their privileges and accumulate more money. They don't care if people die on the streets as long as they can keep on getting richer and richer and have unbelievably lavish lifestyles. I looked at the wine list and I'm appalled. Another world! How much was it? Around 1,500. One bottles of Dom Perignon. I'm enjoying my meal! Do they make that? Maybe they'll bring you a glass of champagne? Why not? I won't refuse. Hello. Excuse me... We don't speak French. It's a pity I don't speak English. I'm really starting to feel the cold. You help me and then, I'll help you. Back with ex-minister, Luc Ferry... I don't see why the police have no means of ending this violence. It's unbearable! There's a risk that you're aware of! So, what! When you see people kicking a poor policeman on the ground... Let them use their weapons once and for all. Enough's enough! That's enough of these thugs, these ultra-right or ultra-left bastards, suburban youths coming to beat up the police. In any case, it's unacceptable. Our army ranks fourth in the world. It could end this foul behaviour. - Hello. I'm a yellow vest. - Yes. I'm not interested in left or right. I'm a demonstrator. I can't afford Christmas presents for my son. I'm not afraid of you. You're pitiful. I vandalised things on Saturday. I fought with a riot policeman. If Mr Macron doesn't get it, I'll start again on Saturday, I'm not with the black bloc. I'm a yellow vest who is starving. I'm Mr Macron's employer. Do you know what that means? Mr Macron's employer. - Abdel. - I pay him to look after me. I'm angry. I'm not afraid of you. Abdel, who are you not afraid of? Where does this violence get you? Stop and think. You have a family. I did so many demos where you're like sheep eating concrete. Nobody listens to us. When I've tried to behave well nothing has changed! It's not a demo, it's war! That kid understands anything. Open your ears, Mr Macron. Come out of your palace. It just awful because it could all go horribly wrong. And it frightens us, too. How far can this all go. When you look at what happened last week, and what will happen next weekend, you can be scared. But at the same time, with Macron and his band, we're heading for disaster. It's a part of humanity that's doomed. It's hard to see what you've got to loose. In any case, if there isn't a thorough revolution, future generations won't experience the joys we experienced. The joy of living. My Michel? The joy of loving! My throat hurts, too. We're like two knackered old people. Let the revolution start, and that's where we'll die. Enjoy your nap. It's always the same people who work. Look at that. It was terrible. KEEP YOUR MONEY! WE WANT THE REST! THE MONSTERS ARE IN MATIGNON Has Michel gone inside? I was worried you'd gone inside. They wanted him to jump from there. We saw "defenestration". That's a step further. First in the noose. Hang yourselves! I'll make a framed picture with all the graffiti I've seen. That could be nice. In a frame poem. "Steal from the people". WE WANT YOUR ARSE. The morning of December 2nd at the Arc de Triomphe. The anger of the yellow vests who contest Emmanuel Macron's legitimacy mean that the king is bare. "We fuck you, Macron." "Load of cunts." "Pay your wealth tax." "Wealth tax for the upper class." "I vote for your arse." Michel, I've finished working. We can read the newspaper together. As a security measure, following the demonstration, the following stations are closed. No links to other lines are open. He is a friend from the roundabout demo. I'm all on my own. Michel had to go and see a family friend. - We can use first name. - With pleasure. Honour, even. The movement has been going for 15 weeks. For 15 weeks, all our mates who've had the courage to go on camera, have been trashed on every programme. They arrive in a viper's nest. The vipers are ready to bite and they do! Shortly after Jérôme lost his eye he was seen on television, with so-called journalists or commentators, who are just concierges or watchdogs. We call them editocrats. They kept asking him, after he'd suffered unbelievable violence, now he feels the violence of State power in his very flesh. When he wanted to talk about the law forces who shoot at the demonstrators. "Don't you think that's violence?" The editocrats change the subject. Never ask if it's acceptable. You must state: "It's unacceptable". "Do you realise the police use war weapons against workers, civilians, people who are just asking for justice?" You have to turn the phrase around? You don't ask if it's acceptable. You tell them it is unacceptable. To go down well on television, always attack your adversary. You're not coming to cry. You attack on the basis of the weapons that cause injury. Don't count the injured and position yourselves as victims. We don't have to be martyrs. We have to accuse the criminals. After that, you can talk about the number of wounded. I'm just reacting off-hand. The aim of saying that is to counter-attack by saying that first of all, they aren't vandals, because all those who've lost eyes, weren't taken to court... - Don't get into that. - We shouldn't? I advise against it. You dig your own grave with that. Systematically, aim for the top. First you counter-attack. Then mention the number of wounded. But don't provide justification. Those people will manipulate you. Your strength as yellow vests is your class culture. I don't think you realise. That's your strength. That's what you must bring to the fore on television. You're not martyrs. You're fighters. You're lucid fighters, going in for the attack. When you're in the media, you're on the front line. Even if it is what hurts you most, they don't give a damn about your suffering. I feel isolated. "Would you like to start with couple therapy?" Last Saturday, 65,000 police officers and gendarmes were deployed around France. Even more will be deployed this weekend. The gendarmes may also bring in armoured vehicles already used this week in La Réunion to evacuate the yellow vests, and here, to clear the roads around Notre Dame des Landes. That's quite some presence. First to evacuate the barricades and if our adversary uses fire arms, we'll still be able to move forward. Some police unions say these security measures are necessary. I don't know if we'll go seeing the terrible threats we've received. - Will we go, Saturday? - What terrible threats? Everything they've said. It'll be horrendous. They've dramatised it all to frighten us. We're not going to be scaredy-cats. We are. But you have to control yourself. - Monique Pinçon-Charlot? - Yes. I adore you! You must adore my husband too. I'm a bookseller. I love your books. There's a pretty girl who adores me. I first saw you on the Tonight show. You were presenting your book "The Violence of the Rich", which really touched me. I needed to hear those words and luckily you wrote them. You helped me to live. Goodness! - Already? - Yes, look. Look at the troop! Look after Michel, he stayed outside. Don't stay there. You never know! I've become very fond of your Ardennes region. It's becoming one of the world's most beautiful places. When the weather's good, it's extraordinary. Be careful of the eggs. There's some blackcurrant jam. Why are you so upset that you slept late? Because when you're not in bed, I know you're working. I was reading the paper. And I read a book. A book by André Gorz. I'd have liked a letter like that from you. "Histoire d'un Amour", published by Gallimard. He wrote it a year before he died. She'd died shortly before him. She had to die for him to realise that he'd instrumentalised her, that he'd used her to become who he'd become. He says what I say about us: "I am me, thanks to you." But in his book, he wonders if she could have said the same thing. So that's the question I'm asking you. Can you say: "I am me, thanks to you"? It's because there's reciprocity. We are who we are thanks to us. How are you? Dear friends, dear comrades. - So is this the CGT union? - It's Sud Rail union. What shall we suggest at the next general meeting? Do we carry the strike through to Monday, or continue after Christmas and the New Year? Should I ask Seb what they did? Seb, we wanted to ask you what you decided at the GM. We decided on oysters as our starter. That's how you recognise mechanics. Seriously, was there a general meeting this morning? No, we didn't do one. Never mind. We'll do it together. The railway workers fight against the Prime Minister's pensions reform is a necessary fight. The right not to be a slave, not to be worked to death. That right is crucial. We've had it with the world of numbers, the world of experts, money, money, and still more money. We want our humanity, We want to enjoy life. Move it over, a bit. In the middle. Perfect. Fix it in place, now. This is the 23rd day of our fight. We want the reform removed and that's it. They need to take a reality check, to listen to the people. The majority is against their project. According to democracy, the government has to listen. They have to accept the people's decision. You'll have seen the media smear campaign against us and the system's watchdogs' growing aggressiveness. Especially the 24 hour news channels some of whom are here, today. They want us down on our knees because we're the final bastions of all things social. We're the only ones who can still strike and show we exist. That's why they want to break us. They're doing their best to divide us by making us believe that depending on your year of birth you will or won't be in their new system. What they're offering is a societal choice. One we don't want. You don't negotiate social regression. You fight it to the very end! We've gathered some great wagons here! Red wagons, green, blue, pink... Yellow... Thanks to the yellow vests! We want just one thing. We don't want charity. We're the workers, the working class. We produce all of this country's wealth. We deserve thanks all year round for running the trains. We do it because we're proud to serve the public. I get up at 4 in the morning so that you can study, go to work, go and see your families, go to funerals, etc. I've got a shitty income but I know who I do my job for. I do it in the name of public service. I do it for you. And I don't get up at 4.30 am to fatten up the shareholders. Fattening up people who serve no purpose. They're parasites. We don't need them. We can produce everything ourselves. They need us. We don't need them. There aren't many of us now. - There's been so much repression... - I know. They're expecting us now. The law forces are just waiting for us. They're ultra-violent. We've all had a sort of PTS after some demos where it was really awful. People got injured. You know lots of people. The last one was Manu from Valenciennes. He got a tear gas cartridge right in his eye. It was the yellow jackets' one year. We did a demo for him. He was there with his blind eye. When someone's blinded, 2,000 people don't come back to the demos. They've succeeded. We went at first, then got scared. We're all scared. I still manage to go back. I need 20 minutes to calm down at the start of a demo. But we're careful. I think the yellow vests' historical moment was a miss. Not the movement. But we faced a lot of betrayal. I call it betrayal. From the union HQ, not members. Political parties didn't join us, massively. We won't get another chance. There was so much spontaneity, so much energy. It can only happen every 50 years. You don't plan a revolution. Taking the roundabouts, coming to Paris on a forklift... You can't plan that sort of thing. We missed out through lack of support. Maybe it's just a pause? I hope so. We know it won't just kick off again. - What day is it? - I don't know. Pull up your mask now. The old lady we like isn't outside. She's there but she's not outside. "We'll pull through." How sweet. WE NEED OXYGEN, NOT TEAR GAS I'm afraid. I don't want a crowd around me. Hello. Are you the Pinçon-Charlots? Thank you for everything that you do. "Money for the health service." "Lutte Ouvrière" union. Super. We have to stick together. We were wondering who you are. We recognise you but can't remember... You're The Pinçon-Charlots! The sociologists specialising in the richest families. She's Charlot the clown. We helped popularise the notion of oligarchy. The capture of wealth and power by a very small group. Have you come to support us? Of course! You are superb! Have a lovely day! How are you going to manage? Give me your hand! That's really disproportionate. - Are they riot police? - No, gendarmes. - For orderlies and nurses? - Yes. How did it go? It was a beautiful demo but there were lots of police. Macron said: "our nurses, our orderlies, our health workers". That's politics! I can't laugh like you. That's a pity because it's funny. I know and I know that he's right. But I can't. Politicians tell you what you want to hear when you need to hear it. When the situation changes, they change too. They're chameleons. Doctors were like gods, during the crisis. That's over now. We each go back to our place. And tonight they're getting beaten up! Really! What did you think of Macron's speech on Sunday? I stopped listening to politicians a long time ago. You've become reasonable! I get on with my life. I pay what I have to. How do you manage your life? I drive my taxi. I spend most of my time in it. I have to work 6 days a week to reimburse my loans. I've got a loan for my licence, a loan for my car. What about fullness of life? Your happiness? That's in the head. You have to look on the bright side of life. Stay calm and let things run their course. What do you want to do? Me, I want a revolution. They send you the riot police if you demonstrate. Look how they put down the yellow vests. Two cops went to court for putting people's eyes out, for broken arms, fingers cut off. Nothing happened. The show must go on. What do you want to do? Attack the system and the riot police come out to get you back on track. When the ecologists tried to occupy Place de la République for the night, did you see how they quashed that? People thought they were crazy! We all thought they were crazy. The 24 hours news channels helped us think that. They accuse them of being dreamers. What if we all stop working? No. You know what? - It's impossible. - Why? Take the taxi drivers. They rip us off. They impose things. We're affiliates but they impose their vision. Some drivers say that if others strike then they'll have more work. So it will never work. You'll never get everyone on your side. You have to stop dreaming. There won't be any revolution. I'm sorry to ruin your dreams. You've ruined our day. It's a disaster. Then, it's a disaster still. What's your name? Take care. Keep going! You can count on us. That did me a lot of good. A moment of pure joy. I'm checking to see if we're dead. And if we're not dead, we're allowed to have a drink. No kidding! When? Tonight, like every other night! Apparently, we're not dead yet!
