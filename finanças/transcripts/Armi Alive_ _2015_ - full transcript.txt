BUFO presents Armi Maria Airaksinen was born on the 13th of July 1912, in Palkjarvi, Karelia. She was the first child of the shopkeeper Matti Airaksinen - and the school teacher Hilma Airaksinen. Later, Armi got a sister and three brothers. When Armi was 14 years old, the family moved to Kovisto, which was a seaport. They became shop- and innkeepers. Armi spoke with a Karelian accent and was belittled in school, but her home was full of life. Armi grew fond of the harbour shore with its sailors and its rocks. That is when Armi wrote in her diary: There is only one obligation: beauty.' "There is only one reality: dream.' "There is only one force: love." When she was 20, Armi fell in love with Lieutenant Viljo Ratia - and married him the same year she graduated as a textile artist Armi didn't feel like she was fully accepted in the wealthy Ratia family. The newlyweds settled in Vyborg, where Armi founded her first weavery. A war broke out, and Armi lost all three brothers. Her home and factory were now behind the border, her friends and childhood playgrounds, everything that she knew and loved. Viljo and Armi settled permanently in Helsinki. First in Munkkiniemi, then in Santahamina, and finally in Kaivopuisto. They had three children, and the housekeeper, Kerttu Mantykivi, was also a part of the family. Armi worked as a copywriter for seven years in the ad agency Erva-Latvala. In 1949, after getting fired, Armi started working at Printex. It was an oilcloth factory owned by her husband Viljo. Armi was 40 years old when things started rolling. Marimekko was born, and the world was conquered. Shops were opened in different continents. Half of the production was exported. The Marimekko brand grew even bigger than its sales. It was known from Tokyo to New York. In the middle of all this, there was only one focal point; Armi Ratia. In her final years, Armi got diabetes. Her illnesses and unhealthy habits led to her downfall. Armi Ratia died on the 3rd of October, 1979. She was only 67 years old. Someone once asked Armi - if anything special had ever happened in her life. She replied: ‘Nothing special. "Just work, from morning till night and from night till moming.' ‘Well. If you don't count losing Karelia and my books'. "Losing three brothers in the war.' The death of my sister's husband.' "Two fires." "Two bankruptcies.' ‘Giving birth to stillborn twin sons.' "The impossibility of finding true love in this life.' "The lack of money. The lack of food." ‘Nothing special. [will now try to pose as Arm. ARMI ALIVE! It's always so noisy backstage. You never know about these gadgets... How did you get the resources for this production? Armi was bold, we have to be. Armi was a pioneer. In a man's world, women are too often underrated. You have a visiting actress in the leading role. Why her? Armi had charisma, so does Maria in Armi's role. You didn't find charisma anywhere else? Wait. Maria! Hello. A leading role for a change. Do you have to prove yourself? We'll see. When I look at you, you don't resemble Armi physically. She gained a lot of weight when she got older. She's not at all a look-alike. Armi was full of contradictions. Fragile and caring. Shy, but liked to perform. When Armi was old, you were barely born. How can you begin to understand her? Askilful actress can relate. Thanks. This is a process that starts now. You'll see the result at the premiere. Where is Armi alive? In a cotton dress. In the archetypal Finnish woman. In commerce. In peace and strength. In crayfish parties. In magazine articles. In letters and in cards. Inme. This needs to be washed today. Maybe I'll ask Kerttu. Kerttu! Give me that. [ll wash it. Put the boys to sleep. [ll wash it. I'l wash the shirt, the fabric. I'l wash the tub, even the children. I'd like to throw myself out with the water. Come on, things will get better. Really? Is it your henhouse that's going to make you rich? Or those bloody ration book cases? If you'd stayed in the army, we could live in Santahamina. At least we get eggs. You can throw them at me. I hate this bug-infested dump! I feel ashamed walking into this dark rathole. A person will die in the dark. Don't you get that, chump? You wear the same coat year-round. You never even bring me flowers. I kill every Ratia. I'l strangle the whole bunch. Mum, what's the commotion? - Once more without the script. Ristomatti, you can go and learn your lines or something. I kill every Ratia. I'l strangle the whole bunch. Mum, what's the commotion? Your father - and your uncle - are trying to drive me out of Marimekko. I won't get defeated with stunts like that Those heartless number crunchers. Why the hell can't I get rid of them? - How did you come up with that? I'd like to change the company name. I have worked to make it bigger. I've done everything... alone. Surely dad had something to do with it. You know what? Why - do I have the majority of shares? Because I was the only one - who believed in Mari. They wouldn't have let a woman run the business otherwise. Use your head, girl. - It's a stupid rumour. Don't worry. I've done the work of seven people. Small-minded people have been taking pride in my work. Bloody hell. I've had enough. I won't let this bring me down. Come down. You'll get hurt. Why can't we live here? I'd be a lot stronger if I could look at the sea. Come down and we'll talk about it It's dangerous to climb that high in your condition. What condition? - You're with child, Armi. Aman. A disgusting, irresponsible creature. I don't want to have a child. I won't. You can't handle another abortion. That's right. I can't handle anything anymore! This doesn't feel right. I don't think Armi was this desperate. She didn't want to die. She wanted - to get back at Viljo. Can try again? Okay, go ahead. It still doesn't feel right. Alittle too late. What were you thinking, Armi? - I told you I can't handle it. The baby is fine. You'll stay here another week. And when you get out, take a taxi directly to Kaivopuisto. You can't even be bothered to come and get me. To Kaivopuisto? There are 80 square metres waiting for us. Its not much, I know. But now Kerttu can have her own nook. And from the bedroom window, you can see... The sea! Hey, what's wrong? Just say it. I have to go to work soon. There's a rumour going around. A big batch of fabric is coming from America. Genuine stuff. It will take over the whole market. We have to think of something else. What if we take the wax off the fabric? We could make cotton prints. They would sell. What would we print on them? Would you design us a simple pattern? I barely have enough time for the ad agency. Hire Eelis Muona. He just got fired. - Can he design floral patterns? Why floral? - That's what everyone is printing. We'll print something else! - Well, draw a design sample. It's absurd that my wife is a textile designer who doesn't benefit the firm. I guess I'l do it, then. But don't expect it to be cute. MINISTRY OF RATIONING AND SUPPLY I'm from Printex. You sent us an erroneous coupon for buying fabric. One zero is missing. No, the coupon is correct. 300 metres for Printex Ltd. 300 metres is barely enough for two Karelian buffet tables. We need at least 3,000 metres. If we have a total of 8,000 metres for distribution, we can't give anyone 3,000 metres. Especially a new company. - Being new is our biggest asset. We even got a new printing table. Please give us some fabric. You don't understand, madam. That's all you're going to get. You're the one who doesn't understand! I have three small children. And I just got fired. I've put everything at stake. On this roll of fabric. Listen, Pas in Peach. Just add one round, beautiful zero inthe end. Or I will kill myself. In front of this office. I mean it I've done it before. I'm officially insane, you see. That would make a great article. 'A desperate officer's wife - took her own life in the Ministry of Rationing and Supply. Three children were orphaned.' "Who is responsible?' The black and whites turned out great. We're still figuring out the colours. I can't believe they managed to print Amfora as well. At least we came up with a new method. Even if it means printing flowers again. We're not going backwards. Our job is to cultivate people's taste. Armi dear, these don't sell Everyone admires them but no-one buys them. We haven't earned a penny. Can we even pay the girls in the print? No. But it's still moming. I adore these fabrics! Ill teach others to adore them, too. Look at this, for instance! You could make a dress out of this. But that's it! Our job is to show customers how these can be used. What's the name of the woman who dresses the ladies of Kaivopuisto? They often talk about Riitta Immonen's atelier. Call me a taxi. Did you rob a bank? - No, the child benefits. We're going to have a show. Think about it, Kerttu. Our prints and Riitta's dresses in a big hall. Don't get excited, we may have to cancel. Ves, the reservation fee is quite big. Why is there no good will anymore? How much do you need? - Athird of the whole sum. We've looked everywhere. You and your megalomaniac plans. Isn't there something good in this period, after all? We lost our homes and husbands in the war, but we also lost our laces and corsets. A modern woman does her own thinking - and can breathe freely. And we get to dress her. Look at this, for example. It has everything. It fights against the little black dress, flower hats, and conservatism. And it's elegant! You can wear it in the fanciest shops. What if we made this coat in two colours - and presented them side by side? And we'll give each print a name. Riitta, I could sell Viljo to China in order to make this show happen. Those are all my savings. Take as much as you need. Kerttu darling! I knew Virgin Mari would send us the money, but she sent us Kerttu! How can you open this? With a hammer. Marimekko. You can't scrub the cow smell out of that name. Or the straws. - Women have always cried in the cowshed. Now they can do it while wearing Marimekko. Small is not enough anymore. We have to aim higher. Abusiness can't be run from the bedroom. And the money? For a workspace of even a shop? We'll borrow it. - From whom? From my dad. And your dad could give us something for a change. We can hire seamstresses who work at home. We'll come up with something. One day this name will shine in neon letters in the middle of Helsinki. Can we present this plain cotton fabric in such a huge show? Huge? Ha! They had sold six tickets at the Esplanade kiosk. Six! Operation ‘dead duck. Kerttu will lose her savings, and V. will mock me. Armi, come and see this. Its a full house, and they're bringing in more chairs. Reporters from at least six magazines. - Ugh... I can't go out there. I was crazy to think I could sell them anything. They love their corsets. There are no lords or fools, only people. You can deal with people. Go out there and win them over. Armi! Shall I go? It's time. This show will mark the beginning of Marimekko. Our purpose is to turn hand-printed fabrics - into dresses and accessories - and produce them in small batches. Our prints will be designed by highly qualified artists, and we've given their imagination a free hand. Also unique, custom-made playsuits for adults - and sport suits are a part of our programme. The stage is yours, girls. The sphinx is sitting and looking - as the world keeps transforming The desert sands are covering the past Empires starting to bloom, prospering among the dunes The sphinx has also seen how they fall When night arrives, the shadows rise up from their graves The desert wind is howling like a hound The beaten men of a beaten land start brandishing their blades At night, the sphinx observes them from his mound Oh, what a sorry sight at dawn they've lost their fight But their nightly war will never reach the end The sphinx is sitting and looking - as the world keeps transforming Destinies of people so small Every crumb of happiness disappears among the tears Disappointment always follows love Its midnight and the moon is rising over River Nile Ayoung girl is trying to find her man The wind dies down, a raven's scream is carried miles and miles The same scene is acted out again Just the sphinx is there fo see how the girl keeps wandering - to where the river once swallowed up her man Excuse me! It seems that you're a sure-fire success. Our readers will want to know where they can buy these clothes. We haven't finalised the place of business yet. Meanwhile, the sales will take place in the address Itdinen Puistotie 9 B. Did you make a good team? - We can't sell clothes in our home. There's no room! - We have to! It's do or die, V. Vanilla! I want to buy this. Can I have it right away? For me, Kissa Kirnauskis and the coat dress, please. Is everything okay? - And I want Karrynpyora, please. Kerttu, write it down. Think about it, Marimekko was a totally new concept. There were no ready-to-wear clothes back then. Let alone someone selling a whole life style. She clearly had exceptional instincts, no need to deny that. No, of course not. I admire her courage. She was remarkable. Especially as I know how timid she was. Although we shouldn't forget where she often got her courage from. That doesn't make her a coward. - No, an alcoholic. She drank herself to death. I thought... I think it's important - that we don't just re-enact some old myth. That we'd somehow see - behind the myth. Or through it. See the person. Alcohol wasn't the only reason. She had to fight against men. Who doesn't? What will happen to my girls - if their old mother isn't here to look after them? The money men just stare at their numbers - and forget about people! Bloody hell. Don't you care at all? What will happen to the girls if the company goes bankrupt? They will lose their jobs! You just think about your inheritance. - Because you're spending it all! Me, me, me! There's nothing under that selfish shell. You want me dead. Talking about my inheritance is awful and cruel. I can barely stay alive. - You're unreasonable, mum. I love those innocent, idealistic girls. Marimekko is ours. - Yes, yours. Give us a bigger role. You don't run a company with a swollen head. The firm means more to you than family! It serves you right if you get fired. Did you ever think you could be blamed as well? You know nothing about running a business! Bring it on. Invite your brother over $0 you can shout at me together. You're a drunk and you spend too much. - Bring it on. Did you think for yourself for the first time? You need a guardian. Do we need Armi anymore? - Why do you ask? She spends money she doesn't have. Marimekko can function without her. - Marimekko can't live without her. Don't you mean Armi can't live without Marimekko? They're co-dependent, is that what you mean? I mean we depend on Armi both in a good way and bad. Hey, do you have those salami sandwiches? Mother's milk on its way! What's wrong? - The whole batch is ruined. The cotton isn't uniform, so the colours didn't absorb properly. How many percent is ruined? - Almost a hundred. If we can't get a new batch, we can file for bankruptcy. I now pronounce these seconds as first-class. Right. Just sell them. I don't think you work here. - No. I just sell sandwiches. You'll start working for us. What do you want to do? I can't design. Or print, for that matter. Don't worry. A person will grow into their job. At least you know how to accessorise. And I seeit in your eyes that you're a great soul. You'll start Monday. We don't create fashion, we create a lifestyle. We ask: What do the people of today and tomorrow - need for staging their lives? We feel the answer in our foreheads and in the skin of our necks. Qur sales are not based on stunts. We offer true things. Where did you get the idea for founding Marimekko? Listen. Asa child, I woke up in the middle of the night when I heard a miraculous song. I got up- and followed a maid in a linen shirt onto a meadow. Agroup of girls with plaited hairs danced barefoot in the summer night. It's a Karelian tradition. Oh, how wonderful. Inthe morning, I picked cottongrass - and fried to spin it into yarn. Yarn that would be like a poem. Or a dream, But the yarn snapped. So my wise mother told me - to add some sheep's wool. Everyday life with long fibres. Oh, Lord. Armi has been telling tall tales to a reporter again. Goon. - Did you know - that in Karelia, women dance barefoot on fields just for fun? Isn't that a dream Armi had? "There is only one reality: dream.' Perhaps she doesn't always know what's real. Who cares. It's bloody good PR. What happened? How did you get here so fast? We never left. Armi and Viljo went to get more food. ts2am.! - Is this your first strategy meeting? Yeah. - They don't care about time. Let's make Christmas! We have nine months, just like a baby. Show me what you've got, Maija. -I have this. This is nice. - Then there's this. I like this. Figure out the colours with the print staff. Give me that. Brown as a horse or - red as a folk dance. My God, Leena. What are you wearing? Girls. Design a nightgown for Raggedy Ann here. Hey, that's a good idea for Christmas. The Christmas season is so short. Let's focus on fabrics, not dresses. Veijo, stop being a chump. Qur new collection - will include the sales for the whole season. It's a risky business. Kaisu. What have you got? - Amen's shirt and these coats. Leena, what will we put in the shop windows? Well? Brainstorming is not coquetry. It's thinking! Something is moving in time, who will grab it? I'm thinking... an old cottage in the woods. Sheaves of straw, long tables, shingle baskets, rye bread. Isn't that a bit old-fashioned? It represents a poor home. Old is brand new. We're not going backwards. Except to retrieve something to our time. Well done, Leena. Remember to behave. Don't act like you usually do. I'l negotiate with the Americans, I can't watch out for you. Stop squirming. - I hate formal parties. You hate parties? - These parties. I feel nervous. About where to keep my hands. And everything. The factory girl needs to think. I'm serious, V. I'm afraid of those posh women. All they have to do is filt their heads and you know your place. It's under a rock! - Why do you care? You're a CEO. They make me so impudent! I'd like to shake the pompousness out of them. Yeah, yeah. I promise. Did you get the invitation? - No, I didn't. [thasn't arrived yet. I did send it Mrs. Ratia, Where are you spending the summer? At work. We barely have time to go home. Ves, you actually go to work. Every day. Isn't it exhausting and nerve-wracking? I'm just a pedlar from Russia, and a sailor. I don't know howto be idle. And I don't have that lady instinct. Working is fun, I recommend it. Ursula... The new designs are presented tomorrow. They're not ready yet - I promised them for tomorrow. I'll kill you myself, chumps. - Why didn't you ask us first? You shouldn't make empty promises. - Miss Big Mouth is fired. There's the door. Walk. You can't smoke in theatres anymore. It's a stupid rule. Did she just fire me? - Don't mind her. She's just hung-over. She'll buy you a present tomorrow. You're not going anywhere. - Yes, I am. No-one treats me this way. If you go now, Armi will think you're disloyal, and no-one will hire you anymore. She told me to leave! Trust me. Armi collects people like she does flowers. She's jealous. She can't take it if people leave her. She wants to hear the truth and to respect you. Let her make it up to you. I gave Leena her job back. - Good. Where could I get a bill of exchange? - From the bank, of course. Cut the nonsense at the factory and optimise. That nonsense keeps us alive. I trust you and especially your husband, but you need better management. Dear bank manager. I happened to be born with a heart instead of a calculator. And the fact is that litu needs a sewing machine. It's a human-shaped problem. I get that No machine means no sales. You can get the loan, but let your husband run the company. You run the art. Art cannot be run. Armi, you're too bold. You'll never get rich. Write down your business idea, and it's settled. I already did. Marimekko - is projecting Venla's and Anna's forest path from Aleksis Kivi's novel - on the highways of this changing world, on streets, on homes, and on the surroundings of our whole life. Armi Ratia. Okay, I see a man of hearts who wants to hang out with you. Wow. Be careful, it means wedding bells. No, I don't want to get married. Go to work now, girls. Unelma and I need to turn a few more cards. And you've got work to do. Tell me if my instincts are right. Is Marimekko going in the right direction? Well, well You picked some dark cards. But nevertheless, despite all the difficulties - you'll be very happy. What kind of difficulties? You'll be threatened from many directions. Your products can be illegally copied. Smaller companies are threatening to overtake you. Don't trust men. I knew that already. You'll become more and more famous - and more and more lonely. Who has the energy to count how much money we've spent on flowers, candles, staffs problems, abortions, divorces, apartments, beauty treatments paid by the company... Name one company where the CEO sews swaddling clothes to her employees. How much do those hours cost us? Armi is not the only one working beyond her duties. I'm not saying it's wise... - At least it's not efficient. Have you ever been to the factory? Women stand around in corridors, smoking and gossiping. Is that what they get paid for? Don't be a fool, Armi. A new factory is too big a risk. No use trying to hide behind your mahogany desk! I know what you are, Viljo Ratia! Acupboard I've been knocking on my whole life. And what's in it? Nothing! But it's a handsome cupboard. Right, Kerttu? Fight, coward! You're nota man. Don't come home, madam, if all you can do is fight. It's my home, Kerttu. Not yours. Whose are the children? We were supposed to work, and she's on the phone. How long have I waited? 45 minutes. - Goddamn. She looks like an English matron. She has no taste. Her skin is ash-grey, and her hair is like twine. You've talked for 45 minutes. - No, I've only seen photos... Armi, stop! - Go and talk to Kerttu. Where was I... What are you doing? Are you trying to kill me? You said the ‘deep thoughts department' had a meeting. Listen, Armi. Although you're completely insane... - You're the insane one, bath robber. It's amazing how you've been able to work night and day for so long. I do this for the people. I love you girls more than anything. I support you whenever I can. Even though it sometimes means scolding. First, there's beauty. Then there's nothing. After that, there's nothing. And still nothing. Then there's all the other stuff. Well said. Did you come up with that? - You did! Bloody hell! What happened, for God's sake? Viljo and Aila were in the restaurant having fun. You have no idea how embarrassed I was! Viljo and Alla! Kerttu, I'm old and ugly! How can you insult Armi and take another woman for everyone to see? Why don't you do it in secret like all the other men? Did the missus say who she was with? That's what you think. Five years, you've been - my best friend. My soulmate. The love of my life. Listen, if Viljo is there, tell him to come and see Armi. Is she in the Hesperia hospital? People are talking. She's here, and that's good. I think she meant it this time. How's she doing? Is she up? Not good. She's in pieces, poor thing. Leena, help Viljo as much as you can. You have to do the work by yourselves. I don't think Armi will be back. We need new designs for the fall. We can't wait for Armi any longer. Turkan does sales, Viljo finances. I look after the shops, but who will be the Design Manager? Dress me. This morning, I tried to buy myself a fitting Marimekko dress. I couldn't find - a single item of clothing that would fit me. Isn't it strange? This company cannot even dress its own CEQ. I'm back. Asa CEQ. I had time to look at this company from all angles. I saw many good things. But I also say many flaws and bad thinking. I want to build - a big, white factory! I want to fill it with flowers and people - who are idealistic and feel good. Girls, I don't want to cry anymore. I want to conquer Americal Leena, stop tossing the dresses into the trunk. Imagine that you're a dress. Feel it in your skin how they lie there and if they are uncomfortable. Like that. Look after her in New York. Keep her spending and drinking under control. What are you two up to? Leena, even if your face is in magazines, you don't run this business. I just told her to control your spending. I'm worried about the whole trip. The shop is a huge risk. I have a feeling in my neck that this is a door: if you throw money through it, itll come back through the windows! Lets notgoiin. The press and buyers are waiting. This is what we came here for, silly. Are you nervous? Let's look at your speech. You have it written down, don't you? I'm afraid to say. - God, Armi. You didn't write it. It's okay. Let's jot down a few words. [tl be okay. What do you want to say? -lcantdoit Squeeze that. Just say - it's nice that they came. And then ask Ben on stage. That's enough. Let's calm down. You'll be great. Marimekko is made by those people - to whom responsibility and a mocking laugh at vain egoism - form an ethical and aesthetic background. Who wrote this? Did you understand that? If you didnt, try out Marimekko's ideology. They like us all over the world! Marimekko. Hi, my darlings. I didn't like those people over there. Mere ready-to-wear sentences. Superficial politeness hung from every mouth as a white row of teeth. Listen, V. We need to think beyond clothes. Home décor, dishes, lamps, vehicles... - Mrs. Rata! Let's unpack first -Youdo it. Hil Hi. What did you get out of this trip, Mrs. Ratia? We're going to change the Finnish way of life. Marimekko will branch out everywhere. This way. Up here. These are the houses, and that's the factory. How did you come up with Mari Village? - We need a new factory anyway. Why not build a whole territory for the Mari people? We're already constructing a test building. Write down: This is modem living. We'll create new life. This is about a living environment - that uses new technical and mechanical means - to encompass a person's whole life! Could you specify? What kind of technical means? Listen. I've hired two top sociologists to design this. This is science and art! What do the employees think about these plans? Are they committed to moving to the village? This is a humane and helpful environment - where children and old people meet Where work and play take place under the same heading. We're going to share all that's good and bad in human life! Are you really a communist, Mrs. Ratia? Nightless night - bears the mist of the morning Treetops reflect the light of the day Nightless night - covers us with its twilight We can't be seen in the midst of the haze The silence is - so complete Bravo! What on earth have you done? - You said I could experiment. That's not Marimekko. Looks like cheap off-the-rack stuff. It's timeless, simple, and it suits everyone. Unisex is in right now. That's tricot. Take them to some bargain basement. All right. But everything's on sale already. Sells like hotcakes. Really? - The biggest sales in years. Is that s07? - Yes. Timeless and simple... - And suits everyone. Sounds like Marimekko. Where to? - To the stock market. Are you having lunch at the club? - Don't you understand, fool? Marimekko will go public. I'l give Marimekko to the Finnish people. Really? The people will decide. The people can be involved. I make the decisions. This is democracy. - People's democracy. Stop babbling. Take me to the airport. And then? - To New York. Just a quick visit. Where are your clothes? - I'll buy new ones. Go and get dressed. The guests will arrive any minute. What guests? I never get any peace and quiet. An engineer and his wife moved next door. We talked about this ages ago. - An engineer... Perfect company for you. Pertti... I believe your engineering skills need an update. You see... We have the best architects in our design department. We use cutting-edge technologies. Armi, no need to talk about work. You don't decide what we talk about and what we don't. He doesn't understand the Mari Village. That's complete laziness - and lack of ideology. It's more about risk control. I'm in charge of the finances at Marimekko. Bullshit! All right. You're jealous - because a woman is doing better than you. You thought you'd bought me. The Ratia family paid for my studies. But you sure treated me like rubbish. Armi, don't start. The record was a bit dissonant, anyway. If my wife did that, I'd beat her up. It has crossed my mind. Excuse me. Hit harder. And then the blood. Alot of blood, a huge mess. Erika! Erika! Mum... - Your father tried to kill me. Let me see the wound. - Call the police. Do you now believe that he wants me dead? Tell me what happened. I was sleeping, when he came in and started banging my head. Call the police. - There is no wound. That's a nosebleed. Did you spread it all over your face? - Of course not. Stop acting, you're a grown up. I'm so not calling the police. I don't have a daughter anymore. Or a husband. Viljo knows what this means. We no longer get orders from the USA. We don't know when they will resume. The Mari Village will be buried. - Stop harping on about that. I suppose you're speaking for my ex-husband. You're all old news. - How nice of you. But a liquidity crisis is not nice. That's for penniless people. I've worked like crazy for the Mari Village. Am I just supposed to let go? I suggest we tell the City of Porvoo that we have no construction plan. Hear, hear. We should talk about Armi's debts. She makes a lot of money - but she spends even more. Bokars is the biggest money pit Finland and Marimekko have gotten more publicity there than anywhere else. And don't tell me you don't wait for Saturday, when the industry leaders come there to be wined and dined. You'll reap the benefits as well. - Are you saying we can't economise? I no longer tolerate any criticism. I want to be treated as a person. Armi, no-one here is denying your value. This meeting is over. Reluctantly, I expect to see you in Bokars. Welcome to Bokars. I wish I'd known. I'd have worn rubber boots. Take off your shoes. It's more comfortable. But I can't. - Listen. I'l get your shoes off. And then I'l tickle your feet with a straw You live here by my rules. I'm bored. We need some noise! That was a rain forest! What a relief to take this off. - How can you move in it? This was nothing, but the twirling made my head spin. I feel nauseous. ButI have it easy. Think about how many times Armi had to act her part? But she loved performing. I don't think so. I believe she wanted to hide from the world - the fearful and timid Armi. She didn't believe anyone could love her. She wanted to appear bold - and confident and cool. Is that the real Armi, then? - Yeah... I don't think she even knew herself which was the genuine one. Do you want coffee and a bun? Or tea, since it's so late? No, thanks. I suppose you're used to this. I'm s orry? Standing on duty, waiting. That's not what I meant. Yeah. Yes. You, too? Oh, I've seen it all in this house. - Hey, Kerttu. Why are those black cars still outside? And the men in uniforms... Is mum in there? - Shoo. Unbelievable! Armi is too much. There are other ways to thank the president - for an export award. - Go now. I understand you're tempted to make this scene comical, but you have to remember that Armi is genuinely distressed and seeks help. Both of you believe in this thing, $0 be serious about it Someone is trying to kill me and my staff with nerve gas. I'm at my wits' end. Who can I trust? Oh, dear. Act quickly. The angels of revenge are on your heels. Cut their wings off. What about Marimekko? Is it time for me to step aside? No, Marimekko has a bright future. You'll get the new factory, and itll be large. But you have to steer the boat yourself. Will I ever be happy? As a woman. Yes, you'll be happy. As long as you discard the unnecessary people around you. We cannot let the designers rule. We must compete with price and volume. Marimekko is known for its designers. Armi won't like this. - Armi has to go! She sent a helicopter to get her a carton of milk! The woman is crazy! But the press eats out of her hand! - I can account for my love life, too. Do you think Finnish people care about the love life of crooked businessmen? Sit down. Armi, I'm sure this is not the right place for this conversation. I've had this feeling for some time that someone is pointing a gun at me. Now I know who. - You can't deny facts. We have fo cut down on production lines and staff. We have to let go at least 100, if not 150 employees. Over my dead body! - That's easy to arrange. It's time to get rid of you before you destroy this company. I won't leave the firm to technocrats. - The debts are in my name. You have nothing. - Is that how you're going to play? Turn Marimekko into a paper cup? Is that going to save this company? Marimekko relies first and foremost on ideas. It needs Armi. - What do you mean? The bank will support Armi. I want your resignation on my desk tomorrow morning. Now it's yours alone. Well, almost. All Marimekko's employees, please go to the printing hall for a briefing. All employees to the printing hall. All Marimekko's employees, please go to the printing hall for a briefing. All employees to the printing hall. Where the hell is Ami? - I'l call and check if she's at home. I hope nothing's happened. - She chickened out. I'm sure of it. She doesn't have the guts to sack people. You think? I'm not the one telling these people they got fired. Guess what. - I knew it. She's not coming. That's right. She bailed out. She says she loves all employees - and refuses to admit Marimekko is in crisis. It's our job now. Armi has gone on vacation. To Venice. - You're kidding! What will happen to us now? - Bad things, really bad. I know that Alfredo and I - are a disproportionate couple. But I don't care. This lushness makes me miss Bokars. Karelia and eternal summer are something I've always searched for. I found them in Bokars. Why did you leave Finland, then? I became in heat. I felt like I was turning into a brand. I left my own company in order to find happiness. I just want to be a woman now. This is not how it went. Who's that? - An old geezer. He just came in. He claims he knows exactly what happened to Armi. He doesn't understand theatre. Okay... Let's take the ending once more. No, we won't. I can't concentrate with old gits shouting on the set. Goddamn. Sorry. Armi was dramatic, but I'd like to see something sincere in her confession. I have no idea when she's being sincere. I don't know when she's pretending to be sincere, or when she is sincere. Or when she is sincerely pretending. I'm confused. - Just trust your instinct. That's the one thing I cannot trust. I have no Armi instinct. I have my own instinct, its not the same thing. I could rationalise everything, but it wouldn't work either. Why is there no poetry in this play? Armi had great, philosophical thoughts. ‘All the good cries will burn and expose you. Isn'tthat a great saying? Why is it not in the play? It's unusable. It leads nowhere. - What do you mean? It doesn't have to lead anywhere. Armi is not coherent. She knew what she wanted. I'm sure she did. I wish she'd keep her mouth shut. Throughout the whole play. Let's finish this, even if it's unpolished. Urho Kekkonen was re-elected for a fourth term as President of Finland. Kerttu. Calm down, dear child. Why is no-one calling me - and asking how I'm doing? All everyone wants is work - and money. Complete strangers. Am I the boil that needs to be lanced? Stop reading gossip magazines. Sleep now, you'll feel better in the morning. I miss V. Where's Jim? Is life just a disappointment worth experiencing? Armi, you have way too many faces. Now is your last chance to reveal yourself. Who am? Maria, you're looking with your brain and seeing only parts of the picture. Look with your heart and see the person. Fear needs to be conquered alone. You are me. I'm back. Because I need you. I've decided to live!
