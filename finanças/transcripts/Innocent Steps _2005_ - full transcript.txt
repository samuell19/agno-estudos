It's been awhile. Man, you can't just give up. A dancer should dance. The hell you doing? What brings you here? How's your leg? You're the best dancer in Korea. Let's start up again. You can dance again, right? Young-sae. There's a good dancer coming from China tomorrow. She's won several Chosun Communalist contests. She'll make a good partner for you. Not interested. Look. Hyun-soo's living it up. Don't you have any pride? Aren't you ashamed of living like this? I said no! Drop it. Is it because of Se-young? Is that it? Be a man about it... Hey! It may be trivial to you, but I'll never forget it. Got that? I know man. That's why I'm telling you to team up with this new girl from China. What do they know? If we just pay them on time they'll gladly stay with us. Frankly, what would they know about how things are here? At least they'll be naive enough not to run off on you. Anyway, go pick her up tomorrow. Her picture's in the envelope. Eat some real food... Why can't he just do as he's told for once? Idiot. Shit. This may sound crazy, But you'll have to fake marrying her. We can't have her here any other way. Hello? You're still sleeping? She's coming from China today. She's arriving at 2 o'clock so hurry up. Okay. Look Young-sae,let's make this work, ok? I got it. Stop nagging. Make sure you get her picture taken and file her entry right away.Got it? Okay. Hang up now! Idiot I'm late.

Miss, we can't admit insects like these. Mista sir! They're not any harm. So please give 'em back, sir. Miss, we need to get rid of them under quarantine laws. I can't let you take them in. It's not an object but live bugs. And it's not harmful at all. You can't beg your way out of this. Step aside and wait please. Mista sir! It's non-smoking here. Please go out. I know! You sure she's coming today? There's no sign of JANG Chae-minor whatever her name is. Know how many hours I've been waiting? Sir? Are you looking forJANG, Chae-min? Hold on. Are you JANG, Chae-min?

Of course that will be after it's revealed that this is a fake marriage. We'll see how long you two kids last. Excuse me, sir? Do you think everything will be ok? They all act big lige that. But they're lazy people. They won't make any inspections. Don't worry. Okay, shall we get it on? What? Why are you so surprised? I mean dancing. What kind of music do you like? Why don't we start by getting you some shoes. Hello? Where are you now? I'm just coming out from marriage registrations. Jang Chae-min, she... What? Why did you do it? I'm sorry.

Acting all crazy. Who are you? Me? Her husband. Bullshit! You son of a bitch! Who said that you can go? I'm the OneTouch national athlete. You're bullshitting. Oh Bro! What happened to you? You said that you're the OneTouch. Hey! What did you say your real name was? I am Chae-ryn Jang Chae-ryn How old are you? I'm 22 If you are lying I'm leaving you right here! I'm.... nine...teen... You've got big guts for a young girl. I was born in March so I'll be 20 after this winter. Really! You just don't stop do you? You fool. Why did you go there? That person who dragged me away. said that they would teach me to dance and pay me. They don't really dance there. It's just a show to sell themselves. And what's with the make-up? You look like a clown. At your age, now wearing any make-up looks the best Sir... What now? Thank you. Whatever. And the "thank you" and "I'm sorry sir" You better lose that accent. Okay sir. There it goes again. Sir. Just hold on. You think this is funny? Sir, you look like a doctor like that. Stop sucking up kid. And I told you to lose the accent! I am serious. You really look like a doctor. I won't charge you for that one. What is this? They are my pets. It's your hobby to raise bugs? They are fireflies. Fireflies? Yes. Back home, in early summer the sky is filled with fireflies. I heard there weren't any fireflies in Seoul When the larvae become a firefly, I will be able to go back. Sir? Can't you teach me to dance? If I go back now, what will my sister and family do? How should I know? Go back home or find another job elsewhere. Go to bed. Whos is banging on the door so early. Don't you see the doorbell? Hello. Excuse us. Who are you? Don't you remember? I'm KIM Chi-sung from the 3rd inspection team at immigrations. December 20th, 2004. 10:20 a.m. Out to inspect Mr. Na's residence. Huh? But, what brings you here? It's a special inspection period for marriage frauds. Oh, I see. So... Where is your wife? My wife? - yes. - wife, wife. Chae-min! Chae-min Jang Chae-min Did she go to the store? The house is quiet. Mr. Na Yes? How did you meet your wife? What? I know that you don't hold a steady job. Of course your income will also not be stable for the same reason. My income isn't stable but... I'm a professional Dance Sports Comptetitor. Forgive me, I have offended you. It's just strange that you don't wear a wedding ring. And there aren't any wedding photos. Not even make-up around where a woman lives. Nothing that belongs to a woman here. And your wife's suitcase is still packed. Miss Choi Yes sir! Take a good look. The proof of a fake married couple living together or not can be found in trivial things. For example.. one pillow on the bed. And if we go to the bathroom... There will only be one toothbru... Young-sae? Is someone here? Honey... The people from Immigration are here. Hello. Will you excuse us? The woman is brushing her teeth. He was just wondering what toothbrush you're using. I use the yellow one to brush. Continue with your brushing. Excuse us. Next, ehm.. next time. Some other time. We'll see you later. Goodbye! What if they come back? It's just a formality. Don't worry. It seems like The swindler specialized in disguised marriage. He already knew about our date of house-visit. Very cautious. Choi Eun-hae, are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Good. Let's show the real side of a public servant. Damn, I look fine today! Hey! Watch it! Let's practice here. Stop gawking in the mirror. Young-sae? Hey, long time no see kid. - How long has it been? - What are you doing here? - I practice here now. - yeah? Say hi and meet Na Young-sae. He's the one that bombed out of the nationals. Oh, him? Hello my name is Oh Mi-soo Hey! I went to 10 different dance schools to scout her out. Isn't she fine? I'm gonna rule in the cha-cha with her at this year's nationals. Isn't that right? Well, good luck! Hey, bro! You have to help me okay? Okay. He has one fine body. damn, you stupid idiot. You think I run a charity or something? Where is the girl? Bring her back here now. Someone cam by from Immigration. Said it's a special inspection period for false marriages. Fuck. This crazy shit. Hey You told me to start over. But I didn't know we'd get a total newbie. Se-young didn't know a single step at first either. Do you know how close the competitions are? Only 3 months stupid. What can you do in 3 months. Are you falling for her? Coach James Ma... This is the last chance for both of us. Just leave this one to me. Look kid. If you act up again you know you're gonna get it. This is your last chance! Act like a real couple, got that? Or I'll ship you back to Yunbyun! Jang Chae-ryn, you can do it. What should I do? Jang Chae-ryn? Where is she? I don't have my keys. Jang Chae-ryn What took so long? Well I... Were you in the shower? Man, I almost burst. My throat is so dry. Jang Chae-ryn Yes? What are you doing? Aren't you going to bed? What's wrong? Are you sick? Want me to give you a rub? Sir! I can't do it! Can't do what? We haven't even started. What do you mean you can't? I can't I'm too scared. What are you talking about? Do I really have to sleep with you sir? Can't we be a couple without sleeping together? We should do what real couples do to look like one but... Sir!! Sir! stop it! Let me go! Shut up and go to sleep! Huh? Sir? You mean we don't have to sleep together? Hell no! I'm sleeping by myself! I've got enough to worry about. There's a hundred things we gotta do tomorrow. And you! Lose that accent! Got it? If you don't I'll send you back to Sang-doo. Yes. Is that Yunbyun fashion? Sir! Straighten your shoulders. Put your balance on your back. Hold your stomach in. Feet at shoulder width. Your body should always be straight upright. This is the upright pose, got that? Upright pose? Upright pose... Hold me. Pardon? What is it? What are you doing? Forget everything you've known about dancing up until now. Got that? Yes. Sir. My upper right body and your upper left should be parallel Shoulders down. Hold your fingers lightly between the thumb and the index finger. This is the basic hold position. Now like this, the woman has to step back with her right foot, ok? Four, one two, three four, one Left foot forward. two Now try looking in the mirror Right foot back. Four, one two, three four, one left foot forward. two, three four, one Brush up your ankles. two, three, four, one... Jang Chae-ryn What are you doing? Is something wrong? It's nothing? Will you focus here? Keep your position! Upper body up! Lower body down Shoulders down. Do it naturally Then.. the woman steps back with her right foot, ok? You fool. If you go back once, you take a step up. Don't keep going backwards! Again. Is your head just for decoration? Step back with your right foot first. You think this is funny? We'll learn how to step from the closed basic to the pivot. Right foot. Right foot. Right step back is called the black check. And the left foot forward is... Keep position. Left foot, right foot Now hold me. Turn Left foot, right foot. Sir... Keep practicing on your own. Man, this is so frustrating. Is it really that hard? You come in, then out, then in... I think it would be faster if I learned it sir. Step out, step in. Sleep with your shoes off kid. Sir they're all so pretty! Wow. What's the big fuss over just a fish tank? They'll all die in a week you know. Haven't you ever bought a chick before Take that one. We'll buy it. You like it that much Yes, my fireflies got a home now. There's the acent again. But sir? What do I call you know? Call me what? We're a married couple. I can't call my husband sir, can I? Yeah, that's weird. So what should I call you? What do they say in China? Comrade. Comrade? What are we? Spies? Well, they also say traveler. I wanna leave now. Honey! Honey, wait for me! Honey! Honey Honey? Where did you learn that? Honey, let's go. You intuition is pretty sharp sir. Don't they look like a real couple? Just focus on shopping. Sweetie! Choi Eun-hae That's what we call a bright beginning and a dull finish. Watch carefully. She's trying to hold his arm despite his refusal. Na Young-sae has been worn out. Wait and see. In a month, everthing will be cleared out. I will remove their deceptive disguise. Why don't you just go live inside there? Soon, they will turn into cocoons. Then if it get's warmer, they'll show off their green lights and fly off. They'll keep their lights shining all night and wait for their true love to come. one, two three days... They'll wait for their one true love. A love they would trade their lives for... What if noone comes? The green light starts to fade. If the light completely fades, they die. I will also... find my true love and wait for it like a firefly. Why don't they just go look for it? Then they wouldn't be fireflies. If you are a firefly, you have to believe in fate and wait. Sir, do you believe in fate? Let's practice Left foot, right. Left foot, right. You're pulling back again. Whoa, that's looking good! Don't they look good together? Merry Christmas. What brings you here? I came here to learn from you. But who is this lovely being. Hello. Come on in. Let's go in. Must I also work in a day like this? Choi Eun-hae this fake couple will spend the time on their own on a day like this. It's the best day to catch them redhanded. I can see that. But for how long should we wait? No matter how hard we tried we do not have a single evidence. Open the bag that's behind you. Ah! So beautiful! Thank you. - Bro, I trust you. - Me too. Let's dance like a couple who's parted. It's one of the five Latins.... and you're learning it now. Don't get too excited. It's just the beginning. - Well done. Well done. - Yes you did excellent. Right! That's how she dances. No fuss. Oh! It's Christmas eve. - Let's have a party. - Party? - Party, party? It's Christmas eve. Why don't you shout? Give it up y'all! Now, live from Yunbyun... popsinger Jang Chae-ryn, Jang Chae-ryn Jang Chae-ryn, Jang Chae-ryn. Hey Did you dress her up in that? Yes, isn't she beautiful? I told you not to touch my things. What's wrong with him? His old partner used to wear that. So what? Didn't she dump him for someone else? It's not like that, stupid. Young-sae used to be the best dance trainer in Korea. He combined the grand Allegro from ballet into Samba. When he trained Se-young and went to the competitions, they caused a big stir. They showed something that no one ever attempted before. But his rival Jung Hyun-soo had his eye on Se-young. Se-young fell for Hyun-soo's future as the son of the dance association president. And at the national competitions, The fool that he is... Young-sae honestly hoped for... Se-young to be successful. But when she lost value as a partner, Hyun-soo dropped her. Se-young couldn't show her true dancing skills without Young-sae She left a note where she apologized and dissapeared I'm sorry sir. I had no idea. Turn the music off. I said, turn it off! Jo-won. You think this is some cheap cabaret? Your body's limp! You call that dancing? There's not much time left before the competitions. Listen to me when I'm talking to you. If you keep this up, I'll make sure none of you will go to the competition Well, who do we have here? Mr. Ma, it's been a while. Chul-yong. What? Ah. You.. Why do you dance? To settle debts? You're dancing to pay that off? What's the music for? When it's on you should move to the rhythm. And... Do you think you're dancing alone? You have no emotions! Drop it if you're gonna be like this. Sir. I haven't danced with such emotions before. I just danced trusting your lead. I breathed where you told me to breathe. And stopped where you told me to stop. I know I'm not good enough. So I practiced hard everyday to be as good as you. The rhytm that you talk about, I don't know what it is. Can't you just teach me, sir? You can do everything well. So can't you just teach me? Do you... love me? You love me? People who aren't in love don't trust each other with their hearts. There is no trust so they don't entrust each other with their bodies too. Do you really want to dance? I don't care if it's a lie When you're dancing.. love me. I will love you too. The rest... ... is up here And... Feel the rhythm inside me. Oppa [respected older male] Oppa, do you love me too? Sir. I have a request. What is it? Could you also teach me the new technique? Haven't seen you in a while. I've been busy. I see. Hurry up will you? Are you going on a picnic? Who is that girl? My wife. Your wife? You totally robbed the cradle man. She's cute. I've seen that woman before somewhere. Now, here comes the bride. Ta-da! Wow? Who are you? Is it really you? It's okay. sit closer! - Good. - Okay, man Hold hands. That's good! So pretty. Bro! You're such a lucky punk! Yeah, I guess. Did you just call me punk? Can the bride look this way please? Ready? One, two, three. Are you not gonna practice? Idiot. You just called me something, right? No, I said you're really handsome. Oh, really. But sir? How did we meet? What? How did we meet at first? Well, what should we say? Chae-min was in Korea for two years. She came as a tour guide Really? Listen! We're going to the bus now. Please pay attention and follow me. Yes. Are you Jang Chae-min from Yunbyun? Yes, that's me. Hop on. I'm the one who came for you. I am... Na Young-sae You mean I was a tour bus driver 2 years ago? Just say that it was a part time job. Well okay, then what? After that? The two guide the tours together. What you see here is Suwon fortress. This fortress... Looks great. You're all looking at You wanna play some ball? No, sirs! Please stop! I'll be damned Don't worry miss. Mister! This is the korean folk village. Many ancestors... No, sirs! Stop it please! After that they call each other and email back and forth. Yes, hundreds of letters. My beloved Chae-min, I just heard your voice over the phone. But I miss you already. My dear love, Young-sae Rain can't quench my thirst for you. I almost cried in happiness. I hear the crickets crying outside. My heart guided by the moonlight... Longs to be with you... I wish with all my heart to see you and be close to you. I am truly grateful for having met you. I love you. I love you. Damn it's blotted. Bark! Bark! Sir, where are we going now? You wanted to learn the Grand Allegro right? Yes. We're going to see it. Really? Wow. We'll see if you'll still be smiling when we get there. Don't worry sir, I'll be fine! Alright little missy. You want to mix that with Samba? Dancing should be freeing. If you're stuck on something, you shouldn't dance. You have to build up your strength. What's this? Again. Again. One. Jump. That's right. Good. Good job. It was good but When you're actually doing it you'll be wearing heels. There will be no bounce. The impact will be much stronger. Jang Chae-ryn. You know how much it costs to rent this gym? Of course it's free, but let's try harder. Not bad. Much better than the other girl. Of course. Thanks to you, I have one less worry. Don't mention it. Doesn't it hurt? No. Can I ask you something? What? Did you do this for your former partner too? My partner now is Jang Chae-ryn. And will always be that way. Sir? Stop calling me sir! - Then honey? - What? What will you do for my birthday? What do you want? I want to go to the observation deck at the 63 building. I heard you can dine up there. And what else? More? Well, 20 roses, perfume... and the other thing they say. Who says? That's all sales talk. You don't turn 20 because you get roses and spray on perfume So you won't do it for me? I'll give you a cake made of rice and seaweed soup. Big idiot. Hey, what does that mean? You said that last time too. It means you're handsome. Hey! Wipe your feet off! Who cares! Damn it.

Calm down and sit, man. It's been a while. Your temper hasn't changed at all. Jung Hyun-soo you piece of shit. Don't blame Mr. Ma. Blame it on money. Then you? If you don't bend, you will break. The last girl, Se-young wasn't really useful. How should I put it? She was too addicted to you. She could only dance what you had taught her and nothing more. What could I do But get rid of her. You bastard... But the new girl looks pretty good. You listen bastard. I won't let you beat me again. You know what happens if they find out she's illegally here on a fake marriage? Departation. I can have her deported back to China... - You bastard! - Young-sae stop it! What is Jang Chae-ryn to you huh? She was just paid to come here. I can sell her for money too. What the hell? Is this what you meant by starting over? How can you sell me out like this? I'm sorry. But if it was you... If it's someone you trained. I though he would go for it right away. Fuck off. Fuck all of it! Once was enough. I can't let it happen again. No! I won't! Mr. Ma, we will have to make sure this is settled. Hello? Yes, sir. She won't budge. Yes. Yes, I understand sir.

Don't hold her back with your bad leg. Go to the hospital with that money. Let's go. You bastards! Stop Sir! Sir! Sir! - Sir! - Don't come near me. Sir, what's wrong? Sir! What's going on? Why are you like this, sir? Sir. Sir... It's me. Take Jang Chae-ryn away. What did you just say? Don't lie to me, sir. You told me you would dance with me. You said that I was only your partner. Are you a fool? Why do you think I dance? You told me to love only you when I dance. Why are you telling me to dance with someone else now? Stop being so naive. Sir, I don't care what happens to me. It's okay if I get deported back to China. I don't care if I don't make any money. Is it because of your leg? I'll wait until your leg gets all better. I'll wait here no matter what. So, please don't tell me to go. Don't you get it? I'm tired of you. I hate you. I hate your laugh. And I hate your whining like a kid. So take everything you have and go! Sir, what are you doing? Fireflies? Bullshit! I don't believe in this shit. Sir! And that wedding picture. Stop it sir! What wedding! The fuck! Sir! Why are you doing this! You Don't you get it? I'm... I'm a cripple now! I don't need this anymore! So get the hell out. Get lost! No, don't go in there. Sir! I'll go. I promise I'll go. I'll go now. So please don't rip this. You have to wear it when you dance. Wear it when you dance, please. Just go. Sir... Even if I leave you like this, you won't hate me, will you? Please don't hate me sir. Now everybody know you're not the couple, why don't you move on? Eun-hae, Did you get the pictures developed? Select the few definite ones. Eun-hae? Choi Eun-hae? It's just that... Look at those two. Even if it was a fake marriage, those two loved each other. How should I know that? It's by looking at how they look at each other. Look at me. Why's the wind so cold? Let's pack it up. Pack-up. What's wrong. You don't like the dance floor? Or maybe... you want me to send you back to China? Next, Samba. Can I ask you something? What does my little Chae-run want to know? Have you ever danced with someone you loved? Love each other at least when you dance? Only third rate dancers would say that. Did he tell you that? Korea's best dance trainer said that? Look Chae-ryn, you must never forget. We're professionals. Professionals don't dance with personal feelings like that. You must erase Na Young-sae from your head. That would be better for you. Happy birthday Jang Chae-ryn. Why the long face on a day like this? Here. How's this? It's your competition dress. This was displayed at the Bon Marche Department Store in France. Do you like it?

Congratulations! It's been a while. I'll be waiting here. Make it fast. Did you come early? I just got here. Pardon me... This should keep them from being suspicious. Let's go in. Hello. So... Shall we begin? Yes. Your name? Na Young-sae. Jang Chae-min. How did you two first meet? I came to Korea as a tour guide 2 years ago. That's when we first met. We've exchanged emails and letters after that. All it took was once... Where did you go on your honeymoon? We didn't go. Why? For me, all of Seoul is like a honeymoon resort. My every moment with him is like a honeymoon. Do you have a wedding picture. Young-sae is very good at dancing. When I watch him dancing, I feel so warm inside. She's clumsy and sprains her ankle often. Sometimes she snores, and she speaks Chinese and Korean in her sleep. It's her hobby to raise fireflies. When she fiddles with her fireflies, she looks like a kid. She's so cute. He likes to give surprise gifts. The best present was the feet marks. Because I struggled at dancing, he painted them on the floor one by one all night. Because we didn't have enough time, I forced her to practive pretty hard. Her feet would bleed and get swollen. But she never even complained once. When I'm tired, he washes my feet for me. He has really big hands. I'm both thankful and sorry. When he holds my feet in his big hands, I say to myself, Thank you for sending me such a wonderful man. Thank you so much. Thank you. She's a good woman. One that I never want to lose. I don't think I'll ever be able to meet someone as nice as him. Did it go well? Yeah. That's good. Congratulations Chae-ryn. Shall we go now. Go. Chae-ryn! You looked great out there. I knew you could do it. It's for the best Na Young-sae. It's the story of your life, man. Here it is. - Thank you. - Yes. Drink it. It's good for pregnant woman. Vitamin. Can you do this as a public servant? Ok, I understand. Thank you. Oh! Long time no see! Hello. Welcome. - A certificate of residence... - Yes. When are you due? Next month. Congratulations. It's a boy. I'll teach dancing the minute he is born. He'll have a talent just like his mom. Will you sign here please. Are your husband well? Yes. How is his leg? When did you take this picture? You look so young. Now you've become a Korean citizen. Congratulations. Oh, and also... ... this is for you. Thank you I did not get permission to take it, but... I wanted to pass it to you. Have a look at it with your husband. Yes. Now we should really get started on dancing. I have a great plan. We'll wrap up the Korean stage and head for England. No. I don't want to dance anymore. What are you talking about? Think about how we got here. I'm going back to China. So you're just like Se-young in the end. that's too bad. If you had met me first, it would've been so much better. Then I wouldn't have learned to dance. Teacher, someone's here for you. How's your leg? I'm really sorry. I had no idea Hyun-soo would do that to you. Young-sae. I heard your fake wife is leaving Korea. What are you talking about? She doesn't want to live in Korea anymore. She didn't say it, but it looks like she had a hard time dancing with him. Everything's all cleared up, you don't need to go to jail. so she'll go back. Go meet her once before she goes back to China. I gotta go. Sir? I told you not to call me sir! Then... Honey? Huh? Sir. It's okay. Now that I have seen you... ... I can go. Sir. Sir? Thank you for raising the fireflies. Sir... Why didn't you come for me? I believed that you would come for me, so i waited. The firefly, is stupid to just wait for the one who loves him. Just waiting for his destined love, the one he would give his life for If she would come to him. I missed you. My sir, Hasn't changed one bit. Sir. look at me. I'm all grown up now. I want to, dance with you. Did you practice hard? Straghten your back. Hold.
