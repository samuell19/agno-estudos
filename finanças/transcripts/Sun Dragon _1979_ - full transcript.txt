Five bucks! - Okay, I'll pay you. - Hey, I lost too, pay me! - Get your ass in there. - Uh huh. - Take your money out, kid, or we won't let you go! Huh, take it out! - Hey, if you pay them, you gotta pay us too. You got $20? - I think you guys are too mean. - [Voiceover] Hey, kid, don't be a dope. Take your money out, come on. Hey, don't be a fool, take it out. Come on, take it out! - Hey hey hey hey, you leave him alone, huh? We're all Chinese guys here. We can make it up. - You, get outta here! - None of your business! - Get outta here! (groaning) - (mumbles)! You guys always push honest people around. This would be your tough luck to meet me today! - (laughs) I think it's your bad luck to meet us today! (suspenseful music) - Stand aside if you don't wanna get involved. (war cry) (groaning) (grunting) (groaning) - Ahhh! - Don't get disgraced for your countrymen! (suspenseful music) (war cry) (groaning) (tranquil orchestra music) (goats baaing) (cows mooing) (dramatic music) - Jim, we've been running for more than four months. I can't take it anymore! - Take it easy, we'll find a place to hide out for a year and then we'll split the money. - What, a year?! We need the damn money now! - Shut up! Ain't nobody going anywhere for a year. Now I said we'll split the money later. - Ugh! - [Jim] Hey, you, boy! Who owns this place? Get someone out here. Hurry up! - [Tom] Pa, somebody wanna see you! - Can I help you? - Hey, do you own this place? - Yes. - We want to buy it. - Hmm? - What's your price, old man? We've got plenty of dough. We don't have time to bargain with you. - This place may not look like much to you, but it's all that we have. And I'm not about to sell it to you. - I know you're an honest man. So you better think it over, old man. Because you might end up regretting it. I hope you realize that this is your last chance out of here. - I've got work to do. The farm is not for sale. (dramatic drum music) You better leave here right now. - We'll be back again. (animal noises) - Hey, wake up, wake up. - (groans) Leave me alone. - I heard some voice outside. Something's wrong. - Huh? Okay, I'll go. (metal clinking) (dog barking) (dramatic sting) - I told you we'd be back again. (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Oh my God! Bill, Bill! You bastards! - Get outta here! - [Voiceover] Tom! - Tom. - Tom! - Mama! (groaning) - Are you gonna make up your mind now?! I got a contract here, old man. You sign it, we'll let you go easy. Will you sign it? Hit her. Will you sign it? You sign it? (screaming) - Stop! I'll sign. (laughing) (groaning) - Oh no! - Get away, bitch! - Tom, run, run away! Hurry, run, run! - Mama! - Let's go! Let's get him. - [Jim] It's not necessary. He's hurt badly. Even if he lives, he'll be a cripple. (groaning) (Western harmonica music) (country bluegrass music) - [Voiceover] Thank you. (bar patrons conversing) - Here you are. - Thanks. - (mumbles) This one's on the house. - Hey, (mumbles). - Are you finished? Cheer up. - [Shao] Kun! - Shao Chong! Shao Chong, what brings you (mumbles)? - Hey! - Give me that. Don't worry about them, they're drunk. - Hey, you look like a rich American. - No. - Not bad here, huh? You own this place here? - No no no no, I'm the bartender here. Come on, let's go sit down. - Okay. - Shao Chong, what brings you to the states? - My grandfather. - Are you sleeping with him? - No, I can't find him, he's moved. - Don't worry, you'll find him. We can look for him together. And my boss is a great guy, he'll let you stay here. - Hey, what's that? - Fist fighter. - Oh yeah? (cheering) - [Voiceover] Go on, hit him! [Voiceover] Come on, yeah! (crowd rallying) - Don't hit me so hard. - (mumbles)! - One, two, three, four, five, six! Fight! (groaning) Hey come on, knock it off, you can't do that, that's dirty! - [Voiceover] Come on! (groaning) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10! You're out! Hey, here's the winner over here, he won all the drinks, come on! - This is great, I'd like to try it. - You want to try it? Are you crazy? - Why? - The whole bunch of them are thieves and criminals. No one challenges them. And that vacant piece of property of my boss's? They've had it for three years and he's afraid to ask for it back. They're bums. - Bums, huh? - Now who will fight me, come on! Which one of you pussies will fight me? If you win, you'll get 200 bucks. If you lose, you still get 10 bucks. Come on, come on, you, how about you, you little pussy, let's fight, come on! You, how about you, pussy? Or you there, you little... Or your friend. - [Shao] I'll fight! (triumphant trumpet blare) I'll fight you. - Hey, look at this Chinese guy who thinks he can beat our best man, Rob. It's gonna be a great fight, come on, place your bets, place your bets! You fellas wanna find out (mumbles) anybody can bet! Come on, place your bets! (crowd muttering) - Three dollars on that guy! - Four dollars! - Go! (cheering) (groaning) - Hey, I win, I win! - Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hey. The money. - Here, take your money. (cheering) - [Voiceover] Your winner! - Wait a minute (mumbles), I'll fight you. - Okay. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Look at them. (crowd ooos and ahhhs) - Wow! - Yeah! - Hey, guys, that boy's great! Let's lift him up, huh? (cheering) - Hey everyone, drinks are on me! (groaning) - If we wanna stay around, we'll have to get rid of him somehow. Unless he agrees to join us. - [Kun] You've beaten them, but I was very worried about you. Just about everyone on the island is afraid of them. - Ah Kun, if they know you're afraid of them, they'll push you around. Don't worry, I'm here. It's okay. - I'm still worried. - Ehh. - All right, make sure you stay around. I'll take you later this evening. (dramatic sting) - Hey, you made us look bad today. But we're willing to be friends. How about it? Let's make a deal. - I don't think so. I don't need guys like you for friends. - [Voiceover] Good shot. - Think about it, pal. You can make good money with us. Why don't you come and join us? It's better than being a busboy. - (chuckles) I'd rather wash dishes than hang around with you guys. - Hey. (dramatic sting) So? (laughing) - If you don't join us, you'll end up leaving here like that ball. - If someone's gonna leave this place, it won't be me. (groaning) - Huh? - What's going on? - Whoa! - Let's get outta here! - Get outta here, let's go! (groaning) - This ought to be a good lesson for you guys. Don't bother my friends anymore! Get out! - Huh? Hey! Hey, Shao Chong, I didn't know you were a kung fu fighter. I'm glad you're fighting for our side. Come on, let's go have a drink. Cheers! - Son, don't feel so happy. Our trouble have just started. They won't quit. They'll get back at you. How can I stay in business this way? - Boss, if you hire Shao Chong, they won't dare come back! - Huh? - Come on, promise him. - Mmmm. (dramatic music) - Shao Chong, you had a good life back in China, why'd you come to the states? - I left because a few problems. It is wise to know others, it is enlightening to know oneself. The conqueror is powerful, the one who conquers himself is strong. It is wealthy to be content, it is... (slurs into gibberish) (snoring) (peaceful orchestra music) - [Voiceover] Help, help! Help, help! Help, let me go! (bullies laughing) Let me go! - Come on, honey, don't hold back. - Hey you, what the hell are you doing here? - You dare to mess around with a girl in broad daylight?! I don't like it. Get outta here! - You son of a bitch! Get him! (bewildered grunts) - Ahh! - Master! - Master! - Master, you all right? - You okay? - You okay? - Master! - Humph, I can't accept your behavior! You should have realized what you did was wrong! Why can't you concern yourself with school instead of this silly martial art? I can't help you! You have seriously injured the Mayor's son! - (mumbles) is known. Officers are looking for him. You have to think some way out for him. - I'll send him to his grandfather in Arizona. - Mmm. - I feel bad to give my family so much trouble. - You have to forget the past. You'll be all right here. I have lots of Chinese friends and I'll introduce them to you. Let's drink to it. (loud crash) - Hmm? - Huh? (dramatic sting) - Is he still alive? - He's badly hurt, but still breathing. - Quick, let's take him to Doctor Ko. He may be able to save him. (tranquil orchestra music) (groaning) - His attacker has pummeled him severely in the ventricle and in the temple. Therefore, I think he knew kung fu very well. It is lucky you found him when you did. You may still save him. Please, move him for me. (groaning) - Hmm? - Huh? - Get away! Leave him! (grunting) There are four critical points on the body that if struck will cause death: The temple, the chest, the armpit, and the groin. He is very lucky that the blows were not more forceful. - Doctor Ko, he was badly injured. - Blood must be forced from the chest. This ancient Chinese technique, passed down for centuries, will cause it to flow. - He'll be okay though, won't he? - After this, he must be placed in a tub of herbal medicine for awhile. Then he'll be okay. (tranquil orchestral music) (monkey chitters) Lie down and rest, my son. Please remain still, you are ill. - Where am I? - My house. - How did I get here? - Two young men saved you and brought you to me. - Doctor Ko, the medicine's ready. - Good. Drink this, my son, while it is still warm. This is Shao Chong. He and Ah Kun found you and brought you to me last night. (munching) - Bleh! Goddammit, what is it?! Huh? You son of a bitch. - You fat hog. What's your problem? - I'm not only mad, I'm going nuts here! We got the money stuck under the floor and we can't use it! There ain't even a beautiful girl around here to give us something to do! Argh! Hey, I got an idea, why don't we split up the money right now and go our own ways, huh? - Shut up! - Cut it out, or I'll give it to you now! - You're nothing! (glass shatters) - Two of you are crazy just wasting your time. Why don't you do something else? Hmm? (dramatic music) (yawns) (monkey chittering) - Hey, good morning. Hmm? (tranquil flute music) (synthesizer funk music) Huh? Doctor Ko! Doctor Ko! Will you please teach me kung fu? - You don't need to learn kung fu. - Why, please teach me. - I am a doctor, not a kung fu instructor. - Doctor Ko. - Learning kung fu will only get you into trouble. Now you better forget about it. - Doctor Ko! Doctor Ko, are you sure you won't teach me? - I have already told you. Do not bother me, okay? What are you doing? What is the matter with you? - You gotta teach me kung fu! You know it, so you can protect yourself! If only... I had known martial arts, my mother, my father, would not have been killed by gangsters. You saved my life! Why don't you help me get my revenge?! (sobbing) - I will teach you. - Really?! (upbeat orchestra music) - (chuckles) Tom, very good. My time has not been wasted. (bar patrons conversing) (whistles) (giggling) - Christine! - [Christine] Hi, Joe. Hi, Dave. - Hi there, baby, how you doing? - [Christine] Hi, Jimmy. (giggling) - [Voiceover] Another beer! (dramatic music) (laughing) (suspenseful music) (rope zips up) - Ahh! Shit, ow! (laughing) Damn it! Let me down! Let me down! Let me down! - You'll be dead by tomorrow morning. - Let me down, goddammit, I'm gonna kill you! (laughing) Oof! (giggling) - Hey, this is my house. Let's go inside. - Oh! (giggles) Oh, this is really nice. (laughing) - Shhh, my partner might be around. Let's go inside. (laughing) - Hah! - Don't move! I don't mess with this baby very often. The money's mine now. I'm taking every cent. You're lucky I'm gonna leave you alive. - (mumbles) there! (horse neighs) - Huh? (dog barking) - What happened? - You stay here. I'll be back in a little while, okay? (suspenseful music) (dramatic sting) - Chrissy! (dramatic sting) Grrr! (Western bluegrass music) - [Voiceover] Remember, drinks are on me! - [Voiceover] All right. - Here's a drink. - Drink until (mumbles). - Don't you worry about a thing I'll take care of it, okay? (bar patrons conversing) - Ahhh! - Hmm? - Huh? - Huh? - [Voiceover] What's going on, who are they? - [Voiceover] What are they doing here? - Huh? - Don't get excited, folks! There's no problem here. I'm just here to do some business and settle a small matter. Just give me a few minutes and then you can come back and have a drink. We'll be having the regular fights later and you can bet then. - Both these young punks just came to cause some trouble. What are you guys doing here?! This has always been a good place to drink, just leave us alone! We're just trying to have a good time, now screw, will ya?! - You no good old fart! (groaning) - Are you okay? - Everybody get out! (battle drum music) - I can handle them. They're asking for it. Step back, you guys. (chuckles) (war cry) (dramatic music) (war cry) (screaming) (groaning) (Western orchestra music) - Hey, I can't believe it! - Hey, you're really improving a lot. - I practice. - Let's have a little practice, huh? Come on. I win this time. - [Tom] How about that? - Hey, not bad! - Nobody's gonna beat me now. - You've learned well. (laughing) - Ah, you just don't know. I put a lot of time and effort to learn this type of fist fighting. The master is a gentle person at times but tough while he's teaching. - (chuckles) It's not easy for a foreigner with such Chinese martial art standards. - The master said this form of fist fighting originated in Shaolin Temple. How many kinds of martial arts are there? - Oh, there are many forms of martials arts. It's not fist fighting alone, there are a lot of (mumbles) too. (Western bluegrass music) - Hi, Robbie. - [Robbie] How are you, Bert? - What brings you to town? - [Robbie] I'm looking for someone to take care of a problem for me. - Man over there likes to mix it up. Name is Gibson. (mumbles)? - [Robbie] I don't know, how much does he want? (no audio) How much do you want? - I don't want any money. I want you to find somebody for me. - Who is it? - His name is Jimmy! (tranquil orchestra music) - Tom, what are you looking at? - You see? This rock is where the Indian used to worship their gods before they went to war. Chong, I'm very pleased to have friends like you and Ah Kun. But I'm sorry, I must leave you and the master soon. - What? You're leaving? - I'm going to seek revenge for the murders of my family. - Murder?! - Look at this scenery. Isn't it great? It looks just like where we lived. Mom and Pop work hard all their life building our little farm. But those bastards killed them. Killed them in cold blood. Took hold of the farm and destroyed everything we had. I've been waiting a long time for this. I'm going back to get them. - Who did this to your family? - There was three of them. I'll never forget the name or the faces, their leader was Jimmy. - Tom, I'll go there with you. - No, this is revenge. This is something I must do myself. - You know, it ain't easy to run a joint like this for all these years. It's a darn night place, you've done well for yourself. - It's been more than 20 years since I started. I am tired. There was more than six of us that came to the states from China. All my friends are gone now. I sure miss those guys. - Why don't you settle down, find a woman, and relax? - I like booze better than I like women. (laughing) (glass shatters) - Huh? Who broke that window? (glass shatters) Huh? Ah Kun, take a look. - Okay. Oof! - Stop fighting! - You better keep out of this, old man. Mind your own business, or you won't live for long. - Ow, ow, ow! - Stop it! - Tell me where those guys are! - I don't know! (groaning) - Come on, tell me, tell me! Tell me where those guys are! Tell me! - I don't know! - Stop! (groaning) (dramatic music) - Boss! Boss, boss, boss, boss! - If you don't tell us where the Chinese fighter is, you'll be next! (groaning) - Humph. (screaming) - You want to live, boy, you better talk fast. Give me a bottle of liquor! (screaming) You like it, huh? (laughing) Drink it! (laughing) - Ahh! (wind howling) - [Voiceover] Robert said if you want to find them, they're at Joe's bar in Phoenix. (dramatic music) (war cries) - There's a Chinese guy giving me a lot of trouble. (mumbles) Saloon, let's go there before he arrives. - You only asked me to handle Jim. Now you want me to kill a Chinese. I don't think 30/70 will do. What do you think about 50 and 50, huh? (war cry) - Hiiiya! - Hiiiiya! - You see? My men are the best there is. They're the experts from Japan. - 50/50, okay. (bar patrons chatter) - My friend, did you find Jimmy? - Oh, you're out of your mind. It ain't easy to find somebody in a town like Phoenix. - Son of a bitch, what do you want? Do you want more money? Take it. Okay. - Okay, he'll be yours in three days. (grunting) - Jim, the ice is ready! - Hiyaaaah! - Wow! - That's amazing! - Jimmy, that was great! - I couldn't move the big chunks, so I broke them into pieces. (laughing) - Marshall's been looking for you all over. You better watch out, he's gonna kill you. - Hey, you saw the broken ice. If Marshall finds me, he'll be in pieces too. (laughing) (groaning) - Every Chinese businessman pays off in this town, if you wanna stay in business. You'd better get some money, do you hear?! (dramatic music) - Huh? - Huh? - Leave him alone! Does it take so many of you to handle one man? Huh? - This is Chinese affair. Get lost, nigger! - My Chinese friend, I'm not like you. You're a disgrace! - [Voiceover] Hold the nigger, you fools! - Come on! Come on! You? You? You? (groaning) Now listen to me carefully. Today I'll let you go, but no more. I catch you around here messing with these people again, I'm gonna put my foot up your ass, okay?! Now get outta here! - Let's go, let's go! - Go go, come on, get outta here! - Let's go, let's go. ♫ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♫ - [Voiceover] Hey you bunch of rats, take it easy, huh? - [Voiceover] See you at church. - Hey, get home safe, huh? (dramatic sting) Hey, we're closed! Do you hear me? Hey! Ahh! (loud crash sound) (groaning) (glass shatters) (rhythmic drum music) (glass shatters) (munching) (glass shatters) (gasps) (synthesizer music) - So now you're back, nigger. You got away last time. This time, you won't be so lucky! (plates shatter) I guess you learned some new stuff. (glass shatters) (groaning) (plates shatter) (glass shatters) (groaning) (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Woo hoo hoo! All right, all right, (mumbles)! Woo hoo! Come on horse, give us a buck, give us a buck now! - [Voiceover] He's a rider up here now! Ain't he a cowboy, ain't he a cowboy! - All right! (cheering) - Come on, get (mumbles)! - Where can I find Jim? - (mumbles) over there. - Yo ho! (Western orchestra music) - [Hau] Don't move. Doing good, baby? Yeah, that's right. - Hey, are you Hau? - Yes I am. What do you want? - Where can I find Jim? - He's out of the canyon. What is it, huh? (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna go stop that guy. Tell Jimmy that there's a Chinese guy looking for him. Tell him to watch out, okay? - Yup. - Okay. (Western orchestra music) (horse neighs) - Jimmy only knows one Chinese and that's me! I know you're not his friend, so I can't take you to him. (groaning) (Western orchestra music) (eagle screeching) - [Voiceover] Hey Jimmy! Hey, somebody's looking for you. - Can't you see I'm sleeping? - We've got something to tell you. - All the 200 bottles were delivered to you already at the old price. - No, Hau want us to tell you a Chinese guy's looking for you. - A Chinese guy and not an army? What's the problem? - [Voiceover] Be careful, Jimmy. (dramatic sting) (glass shatters) (horses neigh) - [Voiceover] Fire, fire, fire! - Get it out! - Okay, okay, okay, all right. (dramatic music) (war cry) - Humph, you've had it, kid. Just like your family. (groaning) - Come on, come on! (suspenseful music) - [Ko] There are parts on the body that if struck will cause death: The temple, the chest, the testicle, and the toe. (war cry) - Shao Chong, get his armpit! (groaning) (loud war cry) (triumphant orchestra music)
