Why did the orange stop? 'Cause it ran out of juice. * When you're alone * * When you're in need * * I will come to you * * Thursday's child * * If you are chained * * You shall be free * * If you will come to me * * Thursday's child * * When you reach out in the night * * For a hand to hold * * I will be there for you * * To shelter you * * To harbour you * * From harm and cold * * If I had wings * * Then I would soar * * And we'd fly away far away * * If we had sails to catch the wind * [Narrator] Things that happened over the summer. Abandoned hose pipes. My wife complains of hay fever. I read half a paperback, but lose interest. My daughter spends 85 pounds on sunglasses. A barbecue on my 40th birthday. A car crash kills three 17 year olds. A man loses his hand in a farming accident, carries it half a mile to get help. Ah, and a body was found. [slow dramatic music] [car doors thudding] * If I had wings * * Then I would soar * * And we'd fly away far away * * If we had sails * * To catch the wind * [birds chirping] Why don't we go inside, Helen? * If I had wings * * Then I would soar * [students yelling] Break it up, you two, come on. Break it up, I said. -[fist thudding] -[teacher grunting] Break it up, I said. Calm down, calm down. * But we must walk through the world * * And the world is wild * * So put your hand in mine * [bell ringing] * And hand in hand * * We'll find a way for Thursday's child * Did you start it? No. Promise me. Okay then. * Fly away far away * [Woman] You all right, Terry? Not allowed to use the hoses. [Woman] That right? Yeah, said it on the radio. Here you go, love. Only got chicken left today. Thanks, love. I'll use the bath water if I have to, carry it down in buckets. Don't you go lifting buckets of water. Well, they've banned the hoses, haven't they? Said it on the radio. That right? [dog panting] What are you doing home? [Man] Something's happened. Here, might be a bit warm. What's he doing here? Fighting. One week suspension and back again at the start of next term. And we're lucky to get away with that, aren't we? Oh, for god sake. It's okay, I've spoken to him. James, take Brandy out, will you? -Now? -Yes, now. [James] Come on, boy, come on. Come on, Brandy. [Woman] I don't think he started it. I don't care about that. I want you to pick Julia up from school tonight. Why? [Man] Just do it, will you? Something's happened. What's going on? Helen's kid. Theresa. What is it? [Man] She's dead. No. Everything's gone crazy. They're setting up a major incident room, got some outside help coming in. What do you mean? What do you mean dead? She's what? On the farm, one of the fields, she's dead. [slow music] She was killed. * To shelter you * She was beaten and we think she was raped. They don't need to know that. They do. Until this guy's caught, you have to be extra careful, all of you. You go to school and you come straight home. Okay. I can look after myself. You come straight home from work every night without fail. James, do you understand? Okay then, eat. I'm not hungry, Mum. Eat something. I can't. [Man] Do as your mother says. * Fly away far away * You realise if this drags on we'll have to cancel the holiday. I know. I'm not going to be around much is what I'm saying. So what happened with James today? Doesn't seem important anymore. No. I had to agree to letting him see someone. What do you mean someone? Who is someone? A school psychologist. No chance. They were going to expel him. I didn't have a choice. I'll talk to them. You can't, Ted. Watch me. Do you think it was someone from around here? With any luck. What's that mean, with any luck? If he's local, then we get him. If he was passing through, just wouldn't be so easy. But he wouldn't come back. If he was passing through then it's safe. Then he'd do it somewhere else. I didn't care about somewhere else. I didn't mean that. Come here. It's safe, I promise ya. It's safe. [upbeat music] * Round the clock radio * [Announcer] And it looks like it's going to be another absolute scorcher out there today. So get on [indistinct] and sit back and listen to some great music. * Red alert, everybody, it's a catastrophe * * But don't worry * * Don't panic * * Ain't nothing going on but history, yeah * I'll see you later. [Son] Dad, could you give us a lift down there? What about work? [Son] Bobby rang. He's not opening the garage today. He's coming down on the search with the rest of us. Take him, he only wants to help. Grab a box then. Straight home after school, remember? Yeah, I ain't stupid. [Woman] I am not, I am not stupid. [Julie] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm taking her and picking her up. [Julie] You don't have to. Don't argue. Why doesn't James come down with us, Dad? He's suspended, got nothing else to do. James? I said I'd help Mum. Suit yourself. * If I had wings * * Then I would soar * * And we'd fly away far away * * If we had sails * * To catch the wind * * We would sail the sea * Why don't we go over with them? -Why? -Just say hello. Gonna be working with them, might as well make them welcome. [men talking] All right, guys? I'm Ted and this is George. Hey, how are you doing? Martin, Neil, Johnny. -All right. -And I'm Greg. And lads, so where are you all from? All over really. Nice area around here. Live local? Just up the road, been here 15 years. And you? 48 years, born and raised. You do much of this sort of thing? Only when we're needed. Usually murders. Must be depressing. We had an armed robbery a few months back up at the bank. Got the guys too. Ain't that right, George? [George] Yeah, that's right. * Fly away far away * [slow music] [slow dramatic music] Can I help, mate? [Detective] DS Lipton, DC Harrow. We're looking for a John Lyle. That's me. Why, what'd you want? [Greg] Theresa Gibbs, do you know her? [John] She's in my kid brother's year at school. You knew her to talk to then. Why? [Greg] Talk to her recently, did you, John? I don't have to say nothing to you. Did you get along with her? What are you asking me that for? Standard inquiry, that's all. Yeah, but why are asking me? I didn't do nothing. She was beaten up, John. You must've known we'd come to talk to you eventually. I didn't do it. But you've beaten up a young woman before, haven't you? Your girlfriend, wasn't it? ABH, got a suspended sentence. That was different. Different how? Look, I'm not saying nothing to you. Where were you on Sunday, John? [slow dramatic music] -Wanker. -John. Well he is. He just walked in and started accusing me. Did you get the names? Yeah, young geezer, Lipton, DS. Can't you tell them to leave him alone? [Ted] They're following procedures. I'll deck him if I see him again. -No, you won't. -It's harassment. He's got a record. They have to look into it. You tell him where you were? Yeah. Then it's over with. They just had to ask. Whose side are you on? Don't give me that. Look, it doesn't matter, does it? [John] It weren't you they were picking on. Yeah, well I ain't the one with the record. [Woman] I am not. Sorry, I am not the one with the record. They're not from around here. They don't know he's my kid. -I'll talk to them. -Thank you. [Julie] What happens if we break this curfew? You won't. But if we did, could you put us in jail? [Woman] Could somebody pass me the potatoes? They'll lock you up anyway. It's unfair. I mean, curfews for everyone under 16. It's for you own safety. Now don't argue. And I'm nearly 16. -Yeah, but you ain't. -Am not. Are not, you silly cow. [Woman] Stop it, both of you. You're not going out, and that's final. What am I supposed to do every night? You could go somewhere if you was with me, seeing as I'm an adult. You're staying in too. Oh no, you can't make me. [Ted] He's okay. That's not fair. Mum. I don't want John going out either. He's old enough. [Julie] And he's a bloke. Bloody typical. Just drop it, will you? You're staying in. Well, what if I have some friends over? Is that okay? As long as you all stay in the house. I'll take them home. They're local, aren't they? [Julie] Yeah, of course. I'll take James with me then. [Woman] James is grounded. You did a good job in the garage. As long as he's back by 11. -[rock music] -* I'm just working * [James] They hassle me, and the guy who did it's probably sitting at home with his feet up. How's that fair? It's only 'cause of your record, like Dad said. I hardly knew the silly cow, thankfully. Just forget about it. It's not you they were accusing. They didn't accuse you. Yeah, but what if they didn't believe me? They're desperate to get someone. Dad won't let that happen. Dad? [scoffs] He's just a fucking DC. He's got no power. They questioned some guy in my year too. [James] Who? Adam Keys. He went out with her for a bit. Oh what, and you think it's him? I'm just saying you're not the only one they've talked to. Well it's more likely to be him than it is me, right? Right. [slow music] [car engine rumbling] All right, Sand? How's things? [Sandra] Good, good. Is he around? Ted? He left about 20 minutes ago. I thought you were both working tonight. Yeah, yeah. I assumed he wanted a lift in, that's all. I'll see him there, I suppose. Take care of yourself. You too, George. [car engine rumbling] [Man] You boys all right? [Boy] What's it to you? You know, you'll want to stick together. Piss off, you old bastard. I hope he gets ya, all of ya. This place is fucked. One little slapper gets what she deserves and everyone freaks out. Yeah, I mean you go to London or somewhere and it's like, "Hey, it's a dead bitch. "So what?" So who's the bloke they got in for questioning? Her boyfriend or something? It's someone out of my brother's year. What's his name again? Adam, Adam Keys. Here, do you reckon he knows anything? He's got. I mean, it's always like that. The boyfriend or the stepdad. But he'll get away with it 'cause he's like 14 or something. Where's he live? Why do I have to do it? 'Cause he's in your year, you muppet. They only questioned him. That's all we're going to do, find out what he knows. So go over there, get him in the van. We'll do the rest. Don't wanna. Do you give a shit that your friend's dead? Yeah. Shut up and do it then. [James sighing] [boy burping] You filthy animal. [doorbell ringing] Let's go, let's go. [car doors thudding] [Adam] What's going on? Get out of here, go. [boys grunting] [John] Okay, get him up. [fist thudding] [triumphant music] Your dad rang. He'll be here for your birthday. [Announcer] It's the epitome of the American spirit- [Ted] You don't think we should cancel the barbecue, do you? Why? [Ted] I don't know, with everything going on. Let's just carry on like normal. [Announcer] Our science correspondent Susan Watts finds signs- [Ted] John and James get back all right? Yeah. And I took the girls home. [Ted] Thanks. Julie's sensible, isn't she? [Sandra] You know she is. Why? [Ted] I've just be thinking, what I hear about Theresa. [Sandra] We have good kids. [Ted] Maybe we don't know everything. [Sandra] Like what? [Ted] Is Julie still a virgin? She isn't, is she? She's sensible. And you didn't tell me this? Because I knew how you'd react. -And how's that? -Like this, shouting. She came to me, which is good. You should have stopped her. It was too late by then. She was worried. I got her a morning after pill just in case. We have good kids, better than most. Just perfect, aren't they? John's got a record. Julie's out there having sex at 15. And James. [laughs] Shit, where do I begin with him? James is fine. [rock music] You all right, Dad? What's up with him? It's nothing, love, he's just busy. [slow music] [slow dramatic music] [people talking] Hi, guys. See this mac they're dishing up today? Disgraceful, innit? It's all right. Actually I quite enjoyed it. Yeah well, I suppose it's okay. You went to see a kid called John Lyle yesterday. Did we? Up at the garage, 17 year old. The narky kid, beat up his girlfriend. She made an allegation. Which was proved, wasn't it? It's my son. [Greg] Oh sorry, mate. No, it's okay. You weren't to know. [Greg] We were just given a list of names from the DCI. It was a few years back, a one-off. He was seeing this girl from a pretty screwed up background. She went for him with a knife. He was defending himself, went a bit too far. None of my business, mate. No, I know. I just thought I'd explain. He's a good kid, so, you know. Know what? Well, it ain't worth pursuing. Why's that? [laughs] You know, it's up to you. But you're wasting your time. I'm not just saying that because he's mine. Well, you'd know him better than anyone else, I suppose. [birds chirping] So this guy you gotta see, this school psychologist. Yeah? Well, I'm just saying, you know, he's going to be expecting you to talk about all sorts of stuff. About me and your mum, things. [James] Mm-hm. [Ted] Well it's a good family you got, better than most. I know. We fight sometimes, but all families do. It's normal. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. [Ted] I had a temper on me when I was young. Just ask your granddad. If someone wound me up, that'd be it, fly straight in there. Did you ever hurt anyone? Anyone who got in my way. I wasn't looking for fights or nothing. Just standing up for myself. But see me now, calm as anything. Joining the police did that. Taught me to be rational, professional. You hold back, take a deep breath, and you're okay. We're a good family. [Girl] What'd you get suspended for? [James] Hit a teacher. [Girl] Your old man must have gone ballistic. He's a cop, ain't he? [James] He was all right. The one time I got suspended, Mum nearly broke my arm. Your dad's a psycho. Everyone's family's fucked up, man. I mean, I knew this girl, right. And she said she used to hear noises from her sister's bedroom every night. Just moaning and stuff, right. Anyway, this one night when she went in there, her old man was only humping her little sister. I mean, shit like that happens. [Boy] Sick bastard. [Girl] And it turns out, right, that her dad's been doing it for years. And her mum knew. [slow music] [people talking] [slow music] All I want to do today, James, is to get to know each other a bit better. You tell me a bit about yourself. I'll tell you a bit about myself. See if we get along or not, okay? Is this confidential? Well, yes. So if I tell you something, you can't tell no one else? Is that how it works? What do you want to tell me, James? I keep hearing noises coming from my sister's room. -Moaning and stuff. -Mm-hm. So I went in there the other night. My dad was in there with her. [George] How do you want to do this? You go left, I'll go right. Hello? Who are you? [Ted] Detective Constable Lyle. [Woman] I don't have any tea. That's okay. Got some bread though, and some cheese. Really, don't bother. I won't be a minute. We're doing a door to door of the neighbourhood, wondered if you saw anything in the park last Sunday. Like what? You've heard about the murder? Around here? It's been on the news. Do you see a television? [dog yelping] A 14-year-old girl was found dead on the farm. We think she might've crossed through the park. Who was she? Theresa Gibbs. Helen's kid? [Ted] You know her? Known Helen half my life. And that husband of hers. They separated three years ago. That long? Thought she might have mentioned it. [dog yelping] Last Sunday? I've seen that kid, dirty little whore. [Ted] Why do you say that? Seen the way she dresses? She's a dirty little whore. When did you last see her? Don't know. Maybe a week ago. Could have been last Sunday. Whereabouts? Just out there. Heidi had a go at her dog. Thought the poor little thing was going to get eaten. She doesn't have a dog. Then maybe it was her boyfriend's. Great big thing. Sure it was Theresa? Yellow T-shirt cut above the belly button. Looked like the whore she is, or was. The boyfriend, who was he? I don't know, just a kid. Was he tall or short? How old? I wasn't looking. I was too busy trying to get that dog away from them. What sort of dog? One of those rescue dogs. A Saint Bernard? [slow music] [George sighing] -Anything? -Nothing. You? The same. Let's get out of here. [tool clanging] Dad. What are you doing? [fist thudding] Leave him alone, Ted. [John groaning] Don't make us have to do this, Ted. -[John coughing] -[John retching] [slow music] [birds chirping] Are you going to give us a hand or what? [Sandra] Help your sister with these. Your dad will be back soon. Mum. Have you wrapped his present yet? Oh, I've already done his and John's. Then you can go around to Jenny's, pick up the plates you promised us. Go on, it'll only take you five minutes. Do your shirt up, will you, love? Why? Just do what I say. [Julie sighing] The answer phone's on at the garage, so he can't be working late. He lied. -Who? -John. What are you talking about? Sit down for a second, will you? If I'm going to tell you, it's between you and me. You understand? [Sandra] What is it? John saw Theresa on Sunday. He didn't. He was seen. John was here. This is serious. Sandra. He was here with me all day. He changed the oil on the van. He watched television and he ate dinner with us. He didn't take the dog out? You were the only one who went out on Sunday. You don't know what your family were up to 'cause you weren't here. [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [James coughing] [upbeat rock music] Oh, for fuck's sake. What the hell are you playing at? What's going on? Get back upstairs now. -Sit down. -Ted. -[hand slapping] -No! You leave him. Come on, come. [slow dramatic music] I didn't mean to. -Ssh. -I'm sorry. What's he talking about? I'll deal with it. You go to bed. I didn't mean to hurt her. [birds chirping] [water bubbling] Why don't you up and change? They'll be here any minute. We'll cancel the stupid party. It's too late. People are on their way. We'll send them back then. We're having this party. Nothing has changed. You knew, didn't you? Go up and change. You knew. [birds chirping] [doorbell ringing] He's here. [Sandra] H. You doing all the work again, are you? Nothing changes around here. [H laughing] Dad. Good god, you look old. Thanks. Look at me, I'm 60 and look fitter than you. [men laughing] There you go, H. Thanks, darling. So where's the boys then? John's staying with some friends. What? Isn't he even coming to your party? He's 17, Dad. He's got other things on his mind. [laughs] Well, good luck to him then. So where's Jimbo? James is sick. We left him in bed. Oh, poor kid. I'll go up and see him, shall I? Leave him, Dad. Let him sleep. [upbeat music] [people talking] Got enough salad there, Terry? These sausages are a bit chewy. You just leave them then, love. What about this DNA testing? Does that apply to everyone? Not worried are you, Alan? [laughs] It's not a laughing matter. Sorry, poor taste. [sighs] They ought to bring back the death sentence for this guy. [George] I agree. If you rape, if you murder, then you deserve to die. No trial and jury. You wheel him out into public- Absolutely right there, George. And you kill them. [Man] No trial? [George] What's the point of having a trial when you've got a positive DNA? Science is the jury of the future. Mark my words. [Man] Makes sense then. [George] It's cheaper, it's quicker, and it's spot on accurate. Hey, what'd you do, invite the local lynch mob? Everyone's wound up about this, Dad. You don't live here, you don't know. Dad, phone. Here, I'll do that. [Ted] Look, I do want to see you. I'm sorry, but it's just impossible today. Yeah, I miss you too. [Woman] I mean, my Doreen, she's the same age. You know., what are you doing about it? We're doing everything we can. Just at the moment, there's not a lot to go on. Someone out there knows what they've done. And they have to eat, drink, and breathe under the eyes of Jesus. From the beginning. Everything. [slow dramatic music] [dog barking] Oi, headcase. Adam's a liar. That's why I dumped him. He started saying we did stuff that we never did. [James] I thought everyone knew. They all know what he says. It don't matter what I say. [James] So you didn't have sex with him? What did I just say? Oh, who cares anyway? I don't care what people think. What about you? You ever done it? No. I thought you were going to lie to me for a second. [birds chirping] Go on, name one. [James] No one. [Theresa] Come on. Any girl in our year. Linda, what about her? [James] No. [Theresa] Shut up you wouldn't. [James] I wouldn't put my dick anywhere near her. [Theresa] Not gay, are ya? [James] No. [Theresa] Be all right if you were. I wouldn't tell no one. You ever asked anyone out? [James] Not from around here. A lot of girls would say yes, you know. The one who aren't scared of you that is. I mean, face it, James. You do spaz off every now and then. Don't do you any favours. -Who then? -Who what? Who would say yes? Loads of 'em. What about you? [slow music] I didn't rape her. I swear I didn't. I believe you. We just started doing it. I never asked. What the hell are you doing? I told you to take it out first. I'm sorry. Well you should have stopped before. I didn't know I was gonna. Well you should have used something. I ain't getting pregnant by you. You won't. Oh yeah, what do you know? You don't even know what you're doing. -I do. -No, you don't. Ain't meant to be that quick. -Shut up. -You stupid bastard. If I get pregnant by you, I'm going to kill you. Shut up. I ain't having your mental children. Shut up! -[hand slapping] -[Theresa grunting] I just wanted her to shut up, stop saying that stuff. [Theresa screaming] [James grunting] [slow dramatic music] [Theresa screaming] She wouldn't stop. Even when I was hitting her, I could still hear her. * When you're alone * * When you're in need * [Theresa groaning] * I will come to you * * Thursday's child * [Theresa screaming] * If you are chained * * You shall be free * I don't know what happened next, she was in the river. She fell or I hit her again. [slow music] I don't know. I really don't. * I will be there for you * * To shelter you * * To harbour you * * From harm and cold * [James] I wanted them to come along, Dad. I wanted someone to help. There was no one around. * If I had wings * * Then I would soar * * And we'd fly away far away * * If we had sails * * To catch the wind * * We would sail the sea * * Fine and free * * But we must walk through the world * * And the world is wild * None of this happened. -But I- -None of it. You forget everything and you never talk about it again. You understand? [door clicking] Thank you. [car engine roaring] [people talking] -Jimbo. -H. Feeling better? A bit. You up for a burger? * If I had wings * [slow music] * Then I would soar * * We would fly away so far away * * If we had sails * * To catch the wind * * We would sail * * We would sail the seas * * So fine and free * [people talking] Terry? Where's the birthday boy then? He's just popped out for some beers. Not over the limit, is he? No, no, he's fine. He'll be back soon. [slow music] [upbeat music] [car engine rumbling] [birds squawking] What's going on then? Nothing. [H] You having an affair? Just drop it, will you, Dad? Why don't I take the kids back with me? Give the pair of you some time to sort things out. There's nothing to sort out, Dad. Everything's normal. Bullshit. We're worried about James. He got suspended from school, that's all. [H] He'd be all right. [Ted] What would you know about it? [H] I still worry myself sick about you. Look at you now. Great family, good job, good house. [Ted] It ain't much. [H] More than you know. You've done better than I ever did. You spent your life driving a lorry up and down the country. It weren't tough to do better than you. I didn't mean that. Your kids will outdo you, Ted. Just like you did to me. You know what, it's the nicest feeling in the world. [upbeat music] I'll do you a poached egg. Go and sit down. I'll bring it through when it's ready. I'm sorry. [Sandra] Go sit down, love. I don't want to eat anything. [Sandra] You must eat. I'm sorry, Mum. Stop saying that. [James] Please talk to me. There's nothing to say. You don't like me anymore, do you? How can you say that? [James] You can't. Of course I do. You can't. Get out, Ted. Just want to talk to him. John. I'm giving you five. One. Just for a minute. John. [Man] Two, three. [Ted] John. [Man] Four, five. You're one of the few things I did right. My favourite. I probably shouldn't say that. Shouldn't even think it. But you are. You're different from your brother and sister. Maybe it's because I always thought you needed me more than they did. I love you more than them. I really do. Some nights I've laid in bed thinking about that. Next day I'd always be especially nice to the others. I'd feel bad. But it wouldn't change anything. I'd still love you the most. [door thudding] Didn't do a dinner tonight. No point for just three. [Ted sighing] What are we going to do? Nothing. It happened. We get on with things. Just that? Just get on with things? That's your master plan, is it? That's it. He's going to get caught. They'll DNA test the entire area, all the men from 13 up. They can't make him. Then he becomes a suspect, one of maybe two dozen. Who do you think you're talking about? I know who I'm talking about. But for five minutes, I'm trying to forget who he is. I'm trying to find a way through this. Now are you going to help me or not? He was at home. I can vouch for him. And we'll have to tell the others. They'll have to say the same as you, that he was here all day. I'll talk to them, I'll explain it. Eventually he'll be questioned. [Sandra] You can teach him what to say. I don't think he's strong enough to get through it. Do you have anything positive to say? Is that what you want to hear? Okay then, he's going to be fine, Sandra. This whole thing will blow over and be forgotten by the weekend. I've thought about every single option, every possible outcome. I can't see a way through this. Then we keep thinking. Have you thought about what this will do to us? I won't be able to work anymore. No one's gonna want to buy your stupid little sandwiches. How can you even think about us? This changes everything forever. Julie, John, what do you reckon it'll do to them? If he gets caught, which he won't. And if he doesn't? Have you thought of that, if this happens again? It won't. That girl is dead because of us. How go you feel Sandra? Because I feel like shit. It doesn't matter how we feel. All that matters is what we do next. And what is that? You tell me. You're the big man in the house. You're the one who's supposed to have all the answers. I don't know. [Sandra] Well for the first time ever, you're going to have to know. You're going to have to find a way out of this for all of us. There's only one sensible thing we can do. No. Then I don't know what else. Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, shall I? I'm going to protect my son any way that I can with everything that I have. And if it comes down to it, then I'll protect him against you. Just remember that. [door thudding] So what do you want to talk about today, James? Theresa Gibbs. What about her? I killed her. [Psychologist] And how did you do that, James? [James] I took her down the woods. We had sex. Then I beat her up. [Helen] Sandra, Sandra. [Psychologist] Those things you said about your dad, why do you think you made those up like you did? Were you angry with him? [James] I killed her. You're the youngest, aren't you, James? Youngest of three? So? Well how much attention do you get at home? Would you say more or less than the other two? I killed her. [tyres squealing] [Psychologist] I understand that both your parents work. [traffic rumbling] [Ted] Remember me? [Woman] The Gibbs girl. [Ted] Just thought I'd keep you informed of what was going on. I bought a paper this morning. Still haven't caught him though. [Ted] Not yet. Want one? [Ted] No thanks. The kid you saw with the dog. It turned out to be nothing after all. The Saint Bernard. We tracked down the boy. It wasn't Theresa Gibbs he was with. [Woman] Yes, it was. You must have been mistaken. I know who the girl is and I know what I saw. The boy's lying to you. We checked it out. It must've been another girl you saw. Don't tell me who I did and didn't see. I saw Theresa Gibbs, not some other girl. I'm afraid you were mistaken. Why, because of this stuff? Gets me drunk. Doesn't make me stupid. Like I said, we checked it out. You were mistaken. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Yeah. Slow down, slow down. What's happened? [traffic rumbling] It's just kids having a joke. How do you know? The spelling for a start. They put your instead of you are. I hate this place, this flat poxy little town. Why stay? Excuse me? I don't mean that the way it sounds. I just wanted to know whether you'd ever thought about moving. Just packing up and going. Well there's no point unless you've got somewhere to go. I had somewhere. Nearly moved away from this place five years ago. -Did you know that? -No. Put an offer in on another house, got my transfer agreed at work. We were that close. What stopped you? -Schools. -What about them? They're better around here apparently. [footsteps thudding] We got him. -[door knocking] -Come on. [sirens wailing] [radio chattering] * Daisy, Daisy, give me your tits to chew * * I'm half crazy * * Me balls are turning blue * [men laughing] Kendall Wright, farm worker. Went missing on the Monday, turned himself in this morning. Why? Who knows, couldn't live with the guilt? Or he fancied the glory. He got form. He's already been inside for indecent assault on a school girl. He's a crank. Look, if he's a crank, we'll know soon enough when the DNA comes through. Whatever happens, we're out of here by the weekend. Where are you going? Home. They can't afford to keep us down here forever. Nothing ever changes around here. [people talking] No one wants to take any risks or make something happen. Everything has to stay the same. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like everyone's settled, this is it, this is good. Don't fuck with this. Some people like it though. Not me. So what do you want to do, Ted? If I had a choice? What are you talking about? You do have the choice. I want to get out, get somewhere else. What's stopping you? You don't understand. When you're here, you're stuck. It all looks so good, so safe. But it ain't, it stinks. So do something about it, you stupid bastard. What's the matter with you? If you're not happy, then you move on. That's life. [engine rumbling] I said I love you. What'd you mean, why? Because I just do. Because. [people laughing] Listen, what we talked about today, do you want to do it? You know what, get away from here, just us. I'm telling you we can, we can just go if we want. There's nothing stopping us, not if we don't want there to be. [birds chirping] We made an arrest. Who? Some sick fuck. Wants the glory of killing a little girl. Wants to be in the papers for a few days. So let him. What else am I going to do? No, let him go, lads. Can't be him. How do I know? Shit, got me on that one. Keep your voice down. [laughs] Do you remember the fact when John was just born? He was sleeping in our room and we used to fuck so quietly so we wouldn't wake him. [laughs] And hearing those stories about people in jail and how they learn to come quietly. Why don't you get some sleep? Why don't you mind your own business? I don't want to be married to you anymore. Did you hear me, hm? I heard you. What did I say? Repeat to me. You don't want to be married anymore. To you. Don't want to be married to you anymore. Fine. See that, that's a decision, Sandra. You didn't even want to know why. There, that's why. The fact you don't even want to know why is why. Very clever. Yeah, I fucking am. [glass smashing] I am very clever. I want you to come home. You know he come and see me at the garage. Is that because you asked him to? Forget about your dad. I want you at home. I can't come back. I don't even want to face him. He's moving out. Why? I mean, what happened? [Sandra] It's not because of you. [John] That's not what I asked. [Sandra] We'll be fine without him. [John] You can't just split up. [Sandra] Why not? [John] Because you can't. Come home, John, please. I need you there because I just can't do this without you. Okay. I also need your help with James. Do you want me to lie? You knew about it? He cries in the night. He never used to. And when Dad thought it was me, I knew something was wrong. I can't let him down. I know. [birds chirping] Could have killed the poor thing. Missed its eye by an inch. Next time I'll get the rat. She's not a rat. Looks like a rat to me. [indistinct] What's all this about? Confiscating an air rifle. She tried to shoot my dog. Self-defense. The little rat went for my Heidi. She's not a rat. -[fist thudding] -[woman yelling] -Get the first aid kit. -Right, Sarge. [woman sobbing] [George] Do you know how busy we are around here at the moment? I don't want to talk to you. Firing pellets at dogs, starting fights with your neighbours. I never started the fight. We don't have time for this. It's childish and it's petty. I want to talk to the other one. Get him in here. Who? What's his name? One of your blokes. The guy who came around to my house, Ted someone. Ted Lyle? That's it. My friend Ted Lyle. DC Lyle isn't available at the moment. Find him. He's the one I spoke to about the Gibbs girl. If it weren't for me, he wouldn't have had that lead. So show me a little more respect. What lead? [Teller] 20, 40, 60, 80, one. 20, 40, 60, 80, two. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, three. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, four. Thank you. I always thought you two would stick it out. So did I, I think. What will you do? What do you mean? Well will you stay around here? Oh yeah, definitely. Julie and James have still got school. John's just started his apprenticeship. We can't move. Mum, they've emptied my wardrobe again. Not now, love. [Julie] [sighs] You're dead, John. I wish his mum was still alive. She'd knock some sense into him. Doesn't matter anymore. You know I still want to be involved, don't ya? I mean, even if Ted ain't here. I'd like that. We all would. Listen to me being selfish at a time like this. We're going to need you, H, more than you know. I'm here. If you still want to be a part of this family then you've the right to know everything. Where have you been? [Ted] Getting some lunch. Why, what's going on? Got a lead on the Gibbs girl. Let's go. What lead? Just something I want to check out. Come on. I'll drive. No, that ain't true. Listen to her, Jules. No. We need you to be strong. -He didn't do it. -He did. Shut up! Julie, we need you. You have got to be with us on this. He didn't do it, Mum. Yes he did. Now you listen to me, both of you. We're sticking together and we're getting through this. Where's Dad? I mean, he can do something, can't he? Where are we going? Give us that here. You're not going to tell Mum? I'll let you get away with it just this once. Thanks. [laughs] Your mum thinks you might like to come stay with me for a few days, like your sister did. I can't. Something's going to happen. Well, if you come stay with me, then maybe it won't. You can avoid it. It don't matter where I go. It's still going to happen. Only one thing to do then. Face it. I would, if they let me. [Ted] What's going on? [George] Which one, Ted? What are we doing here? John or James? I don't know what you're talking about. You ignored a witness statement, why? She saw the girl with one of your lads walking your dog, didn't she, Ted? She's an old lush. She didn't see anything. You got worried, you did a bit of investigating, and you didn't like what you found. No one's going to believe a word of what she says. Which one was it? They're going to be pulled in sooner or later. Please, give me a reason not to do it now. Give me an hour. For what? Let me bring him in, at least that. -No. -What? So you can get the glory? This is my kid. There ain't no glory. One hour. If I haven't brought him in by then, you do whatever. Please, George. [car engine rumbling] [door clicking] [video game blaring] [footsteps thudding] Ted! [pot clanging] [car engine roaring] [tyres squealing] [birds chirping] [John] Mum. Come on, kids. Why don't we give your mum some space? [Sandra screaming] [train rumbling] Here, take it. There's no other way you'll ever have a life. I'm not going to watch that happen to you. Got a minute to tell you everything. I haven't even got a clue myself. [slow music] Stay out of trouble. Work hard for the things you want. Grab all the fun you can in between. I don't want to go. You do as I tell you. And get as far away as you can. Change your name. Get a job. Tell them you're 16. Do whatever you have to do to get a roof over your head. Hotels are good, live in. Stay out of trouble. Keep yourself safe. Please, Dad. Don't get in touch. We don't want to see you or hear from you, never. You'll do better than I ever did. I believe that. [train rumbling] -[door knocking] -Yeah? [George] We got him. [door clicking] I'll get some more plates. It's your turn to wash up tonight. It's always my turn. Only fair, you're the youngest. We were doing it for years before you come along.
