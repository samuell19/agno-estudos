(loud click) Of course I'm excited to meet her. Just don't make that shitty lasagne again. No, I'm not smoking. What do you mean you can tell? No, don't worry about it. We'll look at tickets at the end of the week when I get paid. End of the month, we're outta here. Promise. Yeah, hey, listen. I gotta go. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. (tires rumbling) Ty, we don't know how long this is gonna take. We don't know how long he's been out here. I Just, I'm not comfortable. We're in the middle of nowhere. We don't even know if he's got water. [Sandra] Don't be a hero. Oh, I'm always a hero. We'll be fine. Ty... Ty? Hell of a place to break down, mate. Tyler! Get out of the fucking car! Get the fuck out! Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car! Oh my god (tense music) Get out of the fucking car! Open the fucking door! (tense music) - (gun bangs) - [Sandra] Tyler! Get out of the fucking car. Open the door! (glass shattering) (Sandra screaming) Please don't! Get out! No, no, please! (Sandra groans) (tense music) (Sandra screams) (tense music) (tense music) (baby crying) Fuck. (tense music) No, no. (tense music) (baby crying) You can't just leave us! (baby crying) Your phone and keys will be up the road. (tense music) [Albert] Wildlife control found the body at 5:00 AM. [Ernest] Looks fresh, any ID? [Albert] Katrina Douglas. She was celebrating her 18th in the pub in town. Her friends never saw her leave. [Ernest] What do you make of it? Well, the stab wounds on the back are clearly large in diameter, so I would say he used a bowie knife or something just as big, but... But? But the wound on the neck. What about it? It's neater, it's smaller. He's either used multiple knives in the same struggle or he stabbed her to death and bled her out carefully through the neck like a wild animal. He? So you reckon she's one of ours? Well, she's got to be, doesn't she? She's in relatively close proximity as the other bodies and all within a month. Mm. Tell Sergeant Rico to get forensics on this ASAP and send everything over to us. I'll just call the missus and tell we're gonna be here a while. [Albert] Yes, sir. (soft music) (tires rumbling) (intense music) How was work? Exhausting. Some guy had a heart attack in one of the tunnels, so he had to get an airlift to hospital. Jesus, really? Yeah. Auntie Kate! Hey, how you going? Yeah. Yeah, no we're looking forward to it too. Yeah, you better. (Laughs) (tense music) Some cops came over today. What did they want? Apparently they found a body in a farm just outside of town. They were just asking if I knew the victim. Did you? No. What happened? They reckon murder. They reckon it's the same guy from the territory, so they were telling everyone to be home by eight and stay inside. Be careful. Hey, soon I will take you somewhere fancy and cultured and shit and we can get away from all the crazy murder psychopaths. I've always wanted to go somewhere cultured and shit. I've gotta go back to the farm to finish my hours. But maybe when I'm done, we can go to the river. Yeah, that sounds good. Sergeant. Sergeant Albert, in here. Did any of the witnesses say anything about a white ute anywhere near the bodies? Nothing comes to mind, no, why? Look. What? Sir, that's one of... Well, that is the most popular car in the outback. In both of the photographs it's just sitting there. Hell, he could have been watching us. A white ute. What if we mapped out more of the recent body locations? See if we can narrow down a few towns or road houses, anywhere he could go next and go from there. Good idea, Sergeant. You start putting together a list of the precise coordinates of all the crime scenes. (soft music) (Connor screams) (both hollering) (water splashing) So how long do you want to go for? What do you mean? When do you want to come back? Who said anything about coming back? Where are we gonna live? I don't know. But I'm sure as shit not gonna die here. Sure you're gonna be able put up with me? Pretty sure. Just promise me that you're not gonna lie to me. Promise. (soft music) (engine rumbling) (tense music) What's going on mate? Just a bit of engine trouble. Alright. Yeah mate, whatever you need. Give me your phones, wallets and keys! Oh fuck, here we go. Oi, what do you think this is, mate? - Quickly. - Fuck you, man. You know what? I don't even think you have the balls. Get him. (gun bangs) Shit, fuck! Give me your shit now! Shit dude! Fuck man! Shit! Fuck. You fucking shot him, dude! Give me your fucking shit! Shit! Hurry the fuck up, empty your pockets. Aright, here. And his. Dude, get your shit out. What? Dude, get your shit out, man. - What are you talking- - Get your shit out! [Jordan] Help me! Fuck's sake. Hurry up! Dude, where's your keys? They're in the other pocket. Fuck! Careful! Hurry up! (keys jangle) You're so dead. Fuck sake. Your phone and keys will be waiting for you a kilometer up the road. [Trent] Oh, you are nothing but. Stay the fuck back! You're nothing but fucking roadkill, you hear me? Fucking roadkill! (tense music) (pop music) Everything alright out here, Sergeant? Everything's fine, sir. No, it's fucking not! My mate's lying in hospital! Look mate, we need you to calm down if we're going to help you. What's your name? - Trent. - Okay Trent. When the Sergeant's back, he'll be able to take your statement. Sergeant Rico is out to lunch. Oh, but I'm sure you can handle it. Anyway, we're waiting for those files from Broken Hill. Yes, sir. A beat up red sports car? Yeah, that's right. Did you grab a plate number? No, he covered it up. Look, mate. Honestly, he could be anywhere by now. Alright? What'd he take? Well, that's the thing. What? He just left everything for us up the road. (tense music) You called about a suspicious individual? Yes. There was a man here. Told me he'd committed acts. - Acts. - Yes. He quoted scripture that he was on a quest from the almighty. What exactly did he say? He quoted revelation. The cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral. Those who practice magic arts, the idolators and all liars. They shall be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. And that he was a vessel for the Lord God. Right, did he actually do anything? And that he was given authority from the Lord to purge, a quarter of this earth. - Purge? - Yes. That he was one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The four horsemen? Famine, pestilence, destruction, and death. Is that it? No. He gave me this. (tense music) Give me your phone, wallet and keys. Alright. I'll just get them out. Oi, oi, get back. (tense music) Where's your phone? What's that? Where the fuck is your phone? Don't have one. Never needed it. Take off your jacket. You ever shot that thing before? (gun bangs) You ever killed anyone, is what I meant. (killer chuckles) (tense music) You want this too? Connor? (tense music) (tires rumbling) (tense music) How did your little field trip go? They lost $40 to some kid in an old red sports car. How we going here? Still working on these locations. Would it be worth contacting some motels and surrounding towns and seeing if they've seen the ute or anything suspicious? Doubt it. There's far too many tradies with white utes going through these towns and road houses. No, our best bet, determine a pattern, narrow down his location, and stop him before he strikes again. (soft music) (tires rumbling) (phone buzzing) Fuck's sake! (knocking at door) Shit. Lucy, oh, it's been such a long time. How are you, sweetheart? I'm good. Ah, Luce, great to see you, sweetheart. Ah, a lovely wine for madame. Thank you. Well, this all looks so good. You're so grown up now. So is what's his name here? Connor. Well, this all happened very quickly. What's the story? No story, he's just the coolest guy. You're gonna love him. You sure? [Lucy] Yes. He's at work at the moment, but he should be home soon. [Kate] I can't wait to meet him. As long as he's looking after you and behaving himself. Yeah, yeah, you can trust him. Good. This is really delicious, Lucy. I swear, it's almost identical to your mum's lasagne. She'd be very proud of you. Sorry. Sorry, I forgot. I'm here now, it's okay. Hi, Auntie Kate? Yes. It's lovely to meet you. - Hello. - Mr. Ernest. [Ernest] Detective Ernest. Pleased to meet you, son. So we're dying to hear all about you. Are you a local boy? No, I'm from all over the place. Oh, that's interesting. Do you have a job? Yeah, I work in the mines. And what do you do in the mines? I mine. You mine? What does that entail? Oh for heavens sake, leave him alone. So you're a homicide detective? You don't really focus on theft or anything else? We spend most of our time on homicide cases, that's right. We do give the locals a hand if they need it, if they're short staffed. Why, have you had something stolen? No, no, I was just wondering I guess. You know, I've got some friends that have been mugged. [Auntie Kate] Oh goodness. Can I get you another beer? No, that's all right. I'm sure I can get it. Stay there, enjoy. Lucy, eat up. Um, you're out, mate. I'll get some more from the shed. That's all right, I'll get it. You stay right there. No, I don't mind. No, no, no, no, I insist. I insist. (tense music) (camera clicks) Right... So Connor, is that your car out there? Yeah, it is. Ah, what is it? It's nothing special. It's just an old Honda. Why do you keep it under a tarp? Geoffrey! That's alright Kate. Mr. Ernest doesn't really understand how. Detective Ernest. Sorry, Detective Ernest doesn't really understand how it works out here. How what works? The weather. Seriously, you should see some of the dust storms we get. It can turn pitch black in seconds, can't it Luce? Yeah. Even with the tarp. Well, out here, nothing stays clean for long. There you go. So, why were you late? I thought you were excited. I was. Something weird happened today. At work. What happened? Someone thought that they knew me. Guess it was nothing. Sorry. It's fine. I'll make it up to you. Oh yeah, how's that? Do you want me to tell you or do you want me to show you? You can show me after you've done the dishes. She liked you. Yeah, he didn't. (tense music) His car matches the description. And I don't want Lucy to know anything about my involvement. This is your case Sergeant and I expect you to act as a professional. So get off your lazy ass and get that douchebag outta my niece's life. Yes, sir. Hi, this is Detective Albert. We have some new information regarding a possible suspect that we need you to come and take a look at. I need you to take a look at a photograph. Is this the vehicle driven by the man that mugged you? Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. - Hello? - Miss Lucy Miller? Yes? Hi, my name's Detective James Albert. I'm here acting on a crime reported by two young gentlemen, about a crime which saw the theft of much value stolen. I'm sorry, I don't understand. What do you want? Are you the only one here at the moment? Yeah, I am right now. Are you the only one that lives here? No, no. My boyfriend lives here as well. And where is your boyfriend, Ms. Miller? He's working. And where does he work? Sorry, did he do something wrong? We believe he might have some information about the crime. (tense music) Hey. This guy at work was playing with one of the machines and he fucking... What's wrong? What happened to your arm? I cut it at work. Are you lying? What? No. Can I go and wash my arm now please? Okay. More cops came today. Another body? No. Apparently a couple of guys got mugged on the highway just outside of town. One of them got shot by a young guy in an old red sports car. Can I see your arm? - Ow, fuck! - You piece of shit. Lucy, just stop! Just... Lucy just wait. What are you trying to say? What are you doing? Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, just wait. Lucy, stop! I don't know what you think you're gonna find or who told you what, but it's bullshit. Lucy, let's go inside. Lucy, just go inside and we'll talk about it. Lucy, Lucy, you're being fucking ridiculous. Alright, stop going through my shit. You're not gonna find anything, okay? Lucy, can you just listen to me? Lucy, can you please just fucking stop? What the fuck? I can explain that. How Connor, how do you explain this? Lucy, Lucy, stop. Stop, look. I did it for us, okay, so we can go away. Alright, it fucking sucks here. Leave me alone. Lucy! Did I fucking stutter? What the fuck? You take your fucking jacket! Fucking idiot, what the fuck! (Lucy coughs) Fuck! (tense music) (knocking at door) Connor. I thought I told you to leave me alone! (intense music) (bugs chirping) Are you right, mate? Yeah, all good. So what's with the gun? Hunting, mate. Roos? Yeah. Ah, bag one for me. [Connor] Yeah, will do mate. Catch ya'. (engine rumbling) Ah, damn it! Uh, sorry Sarge. Still can't find a pattern? Maybe you just need some rest boss. Go home, sleep it off. Come back and look at it from a fresh perspective. How many more need to die? Perhaps you're right. Go back to the hotel and keep Kate some company. I'll stick around here a bit longer and finish up. Okay. (radio chatter) That's Connor. (siren wails) (tense music) Get out of the car and show me your hands. Put your hands up! I said put your fucking hands up. You look too scared to be a cop. Detective. You wouldn't happen to know Detective Ernest, would you? He's a friend of mine. Friends, aye? He seemed to have a different impression. Put your hands back up! Lucy said you're out of town. Is she in on it? Or was I the first person to tell her? Either way, she's a good liar. I guess you two are kind of perfect for each other, aye? Except she isn't a criminal sack of shit. Alright, Mr. detective man, you've had your fun. Now why don't you fuck off back to where you came from? You know, I'm out here on a murder case. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? No signal out here, mate. I'll just radio it in then. Sure you will, mate. What's that supposed to mean? Wait, show me your fucking hands. Hey, calm your tits. Oh, I get it now. What's that? Lucy found out about your little hobby. She kicked you out, didn't she? Right. Detective, you self-conscious pile of dog shit. If you talk about Lucy one more time, I'm gonna split your fucking skull open. Put your hands on your head and your head on the car. (tense music) Don't move. (tense music) Oh, fuck me. (engine revving) This is Detective James Albert, code 1080 in progress. (tense music) [Dispatch] Repeat transmission. I repeat, vehicle pursuit in progress. [Dispatch] Copy that, what's your location? Location is Stoneypinch Road north of Redmark. - [Dispatch] - Vehicle description. Suspect is driving a red Honda. Registration number is Sierra 4-9-8. Shit. (tense music) (tires rumbling) [Dispatch] Repeat registration. Standby, dispatch. [Dispatch] Detective, repeat registration. I said standby! (tense music) Shit! (tires rumbling) (tense music) (phone beeping) God damn it. (tense music) Dispatch, disregard previous communication. I need several support and backup vehicles on my location for search and clear. (tense music) Lucy? Luce, you up? I know that, I lied. I'm sorry. Can you just please come and talk to me? I think... I think that we're gonna have to put our plans on hold and I'm gonna have to go away for a while. Lucy, please, just come talk to me. (somber music) Lucy? I just... I just want to say goodbye. I'm gonna have to go for a while. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Jesus Christ! Lucy, what the fuck? Okay, don't move, don't move. Just... Fucking hell, hold it, Lucy. Put your hands... Fucking hell. It's okay, look at me Lucy. Lucy, look at me. Fucking hell. Fuck's sake Lucy, just put your hand down. Lucy. (wood clinks) Oh, you did your best. Don't feel too bad about it, Sarge. Who knows how long he's been here. You've been here what, a week? Yeah, but he was hammered and he managed to lose me. In a vineyard at midnight. Why didn't you go straight to the house? Thought it was too obvious. Even if he did go there, he couldn't stick around. You did all you could. One of the local boys is on his way to the house right now, so let's us big shot detectives get on with the real cases. (knocking on door) (somber music) (knocking on door) Police, open up! (knocking on door) Connor Shelby, this is the police. I have a warrant for your arrest. Come out with your hands up. (somber music) (knocking on door) (somber music) Lucy? Luce? Lucy? - Connor Shelby! - Shit. (somber music) (Connor crying softly) Connor Shelby, I'm entering the premises. Come out with your hands up! (somber music) Fuck... Jesus Christ. (phone buzzing) Sergeant Albert. No, he's just in the bathroom. I'm sorry? Yeah, I'll pass it on to him. Thanks, Rico. Shit. Right, what we need to do. Are you right? (tense music) I'm sorry, sir. It's all my fault. If I caught him last night, then. Get forensics to send us everything they find. Everything. I'm going. Sir. They found a note. "When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying come and see, so I looked and behold a pale horse "and the name of him who sat on it was death." What do you think it means? It's biblical. (tense music) (engine rumbling) (somber music) Fuck. Hey you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah, I said I'm... What happened? I was in a fight. With who? Just some guy. What did you do? It doesn't matter. I got what I deserved. What's your name? Connor, what's yours? Lucinda. Fancy. Yeah, well I'm not sure it suits me too well. Alright, Lucy. Nearly done there? You're still bleeding, so I'm gonna need to stitch it. You're gonna stitch it? Yeah. Shouldn't a doctor do that? I mean, yes, probably, but I mean, I've got fishing wire in my car the nearest hospital is an hour away. Awesome. Surely I can find a needle around here somewhere. Hold that. Back in a sec. [Reporter] And now in our regional news, it has been two weeks since local woman, Lucy Miller, 18 years old, was found murdered in her Renmark bedroom. Police first responded to the crime when they went to arrest the lead suspect, her partner, Connor Shelby, for a high speed car chase that occurred the night of the murder. Shelby, otherwise known as the outback slasher, remains at large and is highly dangerous. Police are urging anyone from the public with any information to come forward urgently. [Reporter] And that's it for the news. (tense music) [Kevin] So I've got a bit of surprise for you, hey mate. Saturday night, you and me, we're gonna go to the footy. How's that sound? (tense music) Sergeant. How are you? And Kate, how's she holding up? She's been better. Anything new, any sign of him? No, sir. He's gone. I'm still convinced he's headed north though. Easier to disappear. No, I disagree. That's where he'd want us to think. But Connor, Connor's a smart bastard. I think he'll keep heading west or maybe even south to the city. Try and blend in. If it is Connor, do you think he'll stop now that we found him? If? No, Sergeant. You find me another suspect and we can talk about if. How beautiful is this? Did your mum ever bring you up here, Milo? No. It's uh... Sure is beautiful. Mm-hmm. G'day. How's it going? Eh, not bad. Name's Kevin. And this is my boy, Miles. Milo for short. Where are you blokes from, then? Oh me, I'm from the city. Just heading up north. Picked up my boy from his mum's place. Bitch. Ah, sorry? His mum. What is she a bitch? A cunt? What is it? Well, she's certainly a handful. (killer laughs) Daddy, I'm hungry. Oh, right. Well, nice to meet you, I suppose. Come on then mate. I'll see you down the road somewhere. Yep, everything should be across by then. Yep, okay. Thanks Shaz, yep, good. Alright... So plane leaves at five. No worries? Yeah, no worries, boss. And all backed up? - Just about. - Good. Sarge, why don't you take an hour off? Say goodbye to your Outback girlfriend, the old fashioned way, eh? (tense music) Boss! Boss, Geoff! (tense music) This footage is from when I went to question Connor the first time. Look sir, I know you don't want to hear it, but I think you have to embrace the possibility that Connor never was the killer. That's bullshit Sergeant! That little shit killed my niece and that's all there is to it. Her murder matches all the MO's. His fingerprints are all over the bedroom and the handle of the knife sticking out of her body. Sir, it was his bedroom! Of course his fingerprints were all over it! Okay, granted on the knife it doesn't look good, but why would he travel all over the country and settle down here? It doesn't make sense! What else can we do? We have to wait. We have no other options. - We have have no leads. - We have to wait. Haven't we done enough waiting? Look, sir, we have a rego number. We can start there. See if highway patrol or any speed cameras have picked him up. Or we can wait. Wait for another body to turn up. Someone's daughter, someone else's niece. You've made your point, Sergeant. Look, sir. I'm sorry you lost Lucy. I really am, but there's only one thing left that we can do. Right, you get Sergeant Rico to run those plates and get 'em on the highway patrol watch list. We'll see what they come up with. I'll go and cancel that flight. Meet me at the hotel. (suspenseful music) (cars whooshing) Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, what on earth? Right. Just hold still, hey Milo? I'll see if I can get this sorted, aye? (tense music) Thought I'd see you down the road. Spot of bother, aye? Uh, yeah. Yeah. What's wrong, mate? I thought you were heading the other way. Well what do you know? Now give me a look? No worries. Sorry mate, I can't quite remember your name? Mate, when was the last time you had your timing belt checked? Eh, my what? Your timing belt, it's torn to shreds. Oh, it's been a while I suppose. All right, I'll take you back to town. No need to fret, mate. I'll just give the RAA a buzz. Yeah. Give 'em a try. Don't think you'll get much signal out here though. Ah, you're right. That's the thing about this land. It's when you need help the most, it's not there. S'pose you're right, mate. So you all good to take us back to town then? I'll take you back. Kid's alright to sit on your lap? Car's only got two seats. Ah, shouldn't be a problem, hey Milo? Hold still, mate. Come up here. There we go, right. Full steam ahead, aye? Seatbelt, think it's gotta do (tense music) (Kevin grunting) (Milo screams) The owner of the Ute is Janet Holden, originally from Robe. Now resides in Burnside Pensioner's Home. Reported stolen seven years ago. It doesn't mean that it wasn't him. There's no reason why he couldn't buy or even steal a car that was already stolen. And so what, he drives the ute to at least two of the crime scenes, then what? Ditches it for some 90's sports thing? I can't see him hiding a body in there. There's only one way to find out. Camera on Sturt near Loxton picked him up at nine and another one at 9:37. Where was the other one? Back... Bakaar? Bakara. That's due west. Why is he heading west? (tires rumbling) (tense music) (tires rumbling) (tense music) (car whooshing) (tense music) [Lucy] Connor! (tense music) West. (tense music) (engine rumbling) (country music) ♪ I am a breaking dawn ♪ ♪ I am a gathering storm ♪ ♪ I am a man on fire ♪ G'day. You seen a white ute come through here at all? Nup, you getting a drink though? Whiskey, huh? So this ute of yours, who was driving it? I dunno, in his 20s. He looks normal enough. So you're telling me you're looking for a normal looking guy driving a white ute in the middle of the bush? Good luck with that. I know a guy. He was going down to the local brothel, and the security guy said we're closed. So the guy says, well what do I do now? And the security guard says beat it. (drunk man laughs) It's a wank joke. (drunk man laughs) What's the difference between a light bulb and a pregnant lady? You can unscrew a light bulb. (drunk man laughs) Do you know where the next hotel is? What direction? - West. - West? Ah, well, southwest, there's a bunch of towns and wankers. But northwest, there's a whole bunch of fuck all. Just desert and snakes and dead tourists, mate. Cheers. You uh, you know another one? A thief, a killer, and some cops all walk into a bar. Who shoots first? (tense music) (engine rumbling) (tense music) [Man] Be right with you. (tense music) After a room? Yeah. How many nights? I don't know. Right, well, 60 a night then. Where's the next hotel? Not for a few hundred K's. If someone came from the Riverland, they'd come through here? If they was heading west. (tense music) [Reporter] And now in our regional news, it has been two weeks since local woman Lucy Miller, 18 years old, was found murdered in her Renmark bedroom. Police first responded to the crime when they went to arrest the lead suspect. (indistinct) (indistinct) [Reporter] Shelby, otherwise known as the outback slasher, remains at large and is highly dangerous. Police are urging anyone from the public with any information to come forward urgently. (tense music) What if something goes wrong? Don't worry, you just remember what I told you. Gonna kill him? Nah mate, we're not killers. Just gonna rough 'em up a little bit. Let's go get our hands dirty, eh? Do we have to? You know the drill. We'll be some place new by morning. Mate, there's not much I'm good at, but I'm fucking good at this. You're my son. You've got my blood. One day, you're gonna be fucking great at it. See, this, this is our country. It's where we belong. We weren't ever meant to leave this place. We were born true blue bloody bush rangers, mate. Now, listen to me, Connor. We were made out here, and you can bloody bet we're gonna die out here. You remember that. (tense music) (tense music) (distant yelling) (gun bangs) (tense music) (suspenseful music) Another one's picked him up. Where? North. North? So he's heading back up. Exactly where was the camera? Blanchetown. Right, so we're closing the gap. (tense music) (tires rumbling) (engine revving) (tense music) (engine revving) (gun bangs) Fuck! (tense music) Boss, I really think that. Hang on. Do you see that? Is that... (car whooshes) (suspenseful music) (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) Shit... Dispatch, this is detective James Albert requesting immediate backup. (tense music) (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) (gun bangs) You bastard. (suspenseful music) (gun bangs) Police, remain in the car. Hands on the wheel. (Connor grunting) Why didn't you kill me? I reckon I just did, mate. In the bed with Lucy. Be fucking hard to frame you if you were dead, too. The pigs had no idea, really, who killed any of them. Then I find you. A sinner. Who steals from the innocent and lies to the only person he loves. No friends, no family. Shit mate, I couldn't even find out where you're from. And if I couldn't, what hope do the cops have? Perfect setup. Why'd you... Why did you kill Lucy? Well, burning in hell isn't good enough for you. You had to suffer. You had to see the consequences of your sins. It's too bad you didn't tell Lucy the truth sooner. She wouldn't have to be involved. She would've left you and she wouldn't have had to bleed out like that. (Connor screaming) Fuck you! She took a while to bleed out, that one. I wonder how long you'll take. (Connor groans) Cops. [Killer] What's that? The cops are coming. Yeah, how do you figure that? That guy you had with the kid, you let him loose. He's getting cops they're probably nearly here already. You little shit. (tense music) (gun bangs) (tense music) (gun bangs) (tense music) Fuck. I'm sorry boss. I really thought we could have caught him. We still can, stay with the body. Call for back up. Boss. Boss! Geoff! (soft music) Boss, wait! Stop! (tense music) (tires rumbling) (tense music) Wait! Where are you? (tense music) [Albert] Ernest! Wait! (tense music) I didn't do it. I didn't kill Lucy. You shut your fucking mouth. Wait! Ernest! Do you have handcuffs? If you think I'm gonna cuff myself, you really are insane. What do you want? Why are you doing this? Stop! Ernest! I didn't kill anyone. I'm not a killer. Prove it. If I'm a killer, why haven't I shot you? Bargaining power, for keeping yourself out of jail. But don't worry, I've got no intention of taking you in.
