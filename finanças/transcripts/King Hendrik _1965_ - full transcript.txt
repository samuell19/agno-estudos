The front of the wagon burns most. Good luck, Koos. Good luck. -Thanks, how's Caroline? First class. -Bet she's missing Fanie? I assume so. The ways things stand I think we will soon be family. Goodbye everyone. Come on, Herman. As first secretary you should know. There's probably an issue he hasn't mentioned. They might name a marsh after me. Maybe but, cabinet posts don't grow on trees. Yes, that's true. The PM would also like your opinion on this issue. Fine. Remember this issue. -Right. Have you read today's paper? No, not opened it yet. Just tidying my desk Then I'm catching a private jet to Ellis Park to watch the match. So, what's the news? -Read it yourself You'll find it very interesting. My new cabinet post? -No... Its about Stellendam They have recklessly declared independence. That's all? -It's front page news! What's up in Stellendam? Protectorate of Stellendam Do you know about this? Not really. Its surely all a publicity stunt? That's what I thought too Until the Prime Minister started asking questions. You mean the Prime Minister is taking this seriously? Well, he's asked me to go down there. I have two professors working in the archives and its all legally correct. But this is hogwash! Could be, we hope so. But this issue could become far more serious! Its the work of some lunatic, you will see! Oh, good morning Prime Minister. Certainly. I was just paging through it. Yes, sir. At once, Prime Miinister. Goodbye, Prime Minister. That was the Prime Minister. -I assumed so. I tell you this is far more serious than we think! You better go find out what's going on! Give me the Mayor of Stellendam! Urgent! The mastermind's thought of everything. Tell me the second you get any news! That numskull! They're all insane. Except for Mr. Van der Merwe. My suitcase... Koos... Looks like trouble. What trouble, Herman? A leading judge has now admitted that legally, Stellendam is unofficially a republic. Legally? The prosecutor drafted this document to incorporate Stellendam into South Africa and untangle this issue. He asked me to sign it. Very well, let me sign, then. Sorry, you can't sign it... the mayor must authorize it. Why the mayor? I'm the intermediary! The prosecutor said no intermediary is needed! Since the mayor is elected representative ... of Stellendam, he should sign it. Well, catch you later. I must see the mayor. Do I no longer have a seat in the council? Not until Mr. Buckley has signed this. I'll sign it! Don't annoy him. This requires meticulous detail. If he doesn't sign we'll be knee deep in the erm... trouble. Be diplomatic, ok? -Yes. Be diplomatic, Koos... Diplomatic Write that in your document! As leader of the opposition in Stellendam, I take an oath that I will not rest until rights and justice are achieved. Friends... I am humbled. Have you heard anything from Cape Town, Koos? Not a word from the Prime Minister. Nothing After all your years of service? Sacrifice and loyalty? -The deepest cut of all. In my hour of need I stand alone. Forgotten Koos, telephone! The Prime Minister wants to talk with you. De Wet here. Good Morning, Prime Minister. Whats up with you? In half an hour, Stellendam will again be part of the republic. What happened? We're having tea with the Buckley's He's come to his senses and is signing. Wonderful -Let's get dressed. Come, Erica, let's go. -What's wrong, Koos? Now, the Englishman won't sign! Let's go, Erica. We haven't even had tea. -We can drink at home. What are you doing here? Morning, sleep well? -Why this wire? Its the new border between Stellendam and South Africa. We fenced in the entire border last night. Border? And my outhouse??! Its now in Stellendam. You'll need a passport. But, I just want to.... Damnit! Sorry, but all South Africans must show a passport here now. Let's say I don't have a passport? You'll have to hold it in until you get one. I'm done talking Its a national disaster Not a party. This isn't a normal party, its a royal ball. Buckley invited us. Not interested in Buckley's royal ball. Seems like you take his royalty seriously. You're taking it seriously by refusing to go. I won't shirk my responsibilities! You can't just suddenly cancel. Everyone's going to be there. They sent that invitation to annoy me! And he'll succeed! You're just stubborn! Morning, is Mr. de Wet home? The Prime Minister would like to speak with him. Thank you, Ma'am. Koos, the President wants to speak to you. He does, does he? Good! There's something I would like to say! Good morning, sir. I'm sorry, I thought you were the other... You see, the last person to phone... It wasn't you it was... I'm sorry, Prime Minister. No, I'm afraid it hasn't been signed yet. Yes, I will do my best... Sure. Goodbye Fanie my boy, you're back. Its wonderful to see you. -How are you, dad? Since you left, the most horrible thing has happened. They booted me out of parliament. There's now random kings and prime ministers... You played very well today. -Thanks. Even my own staff ignore me. The whole town is mad. I'm the only original minister left. Dad, it can't be that serious. -It is, Fanie, wait and see. Kings and stuff You'll see, my boy... They're insane! I told you. All insane. Hello there, what do you want? G'day Uncle Hendrik -Well played, old boy. Thanks -You know they made me king? So I see. Oh excuse me... Herman, why didn't you tell me about this? The PM decided we need an embassador and picked me. Why are you here? I thought you declined? My wife forced me. Think I want to be here? Our Prime Minister doesn't really recognise this farce, does he? Of course and he wants it done diplomatically! Diplomatic? He needs a batallion of soldiers to exterminate them! We will not interfere in the affairs of foreign nations! Excuse me, I must receive the Prime Minister. Look here! I warn you.... Let's go. I'm fed up. But we just arrived. Not even danced! We can dance at home. Come! Yes, I'm sick. Morning, Schalk Your new passport? I'm in a hurry! Schalk Christian Prinsloo? -Damnit, you know me! Reason for travel? -I'm just going over there! You have 15 mins. Bon Voyage! ...Fanie de Wet isn't playing today and its extremely unfortunate for South Africa... The balls come out and its a total giveaway to its centres. And the ball hits the goal-line! A scrum on the All Blacks goal line, he picks up the ball and kicks it to the side And that's the final whistle! South Africa has lost the third test This is sure to go down as a life lesson for De Wet... Signs: Lombard must go! Up Stellendam! Got no time for you sanctimonious fools! Koos de Wet! Help me up, man! Say the password! -To hell with the password! Could you not find a more accessible place to hide? Where's Koos? -The General is in the camp. That way. Insanity! Sargeant! -Yes General! Get every shotgun ready And make sure everyone has enough amunition. And also Tell that civilian to turn the sound down on his radio. Wait til the Prime Minister hears about this! What do you want? -No, what do YOU want?! It's up to me to plan a war strategy. My first diplomatic assignment and this happens. You know what happened, right? Yes my advisors told me. Buckley declared war against South Africa. But why? Because you blew up his yacht? Why did you blow up his yacht? Did you hear that Lombard? See what's happened? Buckley is stark raving mad! He's bombing innocent citizens in their outhouses! But you started it! Its your fault! What does it matter? How does it compare to... Destroy that radio! The South African government might be too afraid to fight but I'm not! We De Wets have never run away. Stop this warmongering before someone gets hurt! What?! They kicked me out of parliament! They chased my son out of the rugby team! And you're worried that someone might get hurt?! But I said the PM wanted to do things diplomatically! The Prime Minister... Its now time for action. See if you can get that document of yours signed. But be quick before blood is spilt. Now leave me alone. I must ride into battle with honour Koos, my old friend. You're taking this whole thing far too seriously. You realise what could happen? Understand what could happen? The Springboks could lose the series! General! -Yes, Commandant? Sir, there's a female in the camp. You know my orders. No women are allowed during active duty. What do you think this is? A gypsy camp? Get rid of her. Put that man on report! Its your wife, sir. She wants to speak to you. My wife? There can be no exceptions. Not even for the leader. I won't speak with her. Get rid of her! -Yes General! The general doesn't wish to see you. Koos, stop this nonsense and listen to me. Commandant! -General! Throw this woman out! Immediately! Come woman! Leave the camp! You don't speak to my wife like that! When are you lot going to stop playing kick the can? Commandant! -General! Remind this woman she is speaking to a General. Err, with a General of the guerrila rank. He says you are speaking to a General of the guerrila rank! I'm worried. You've not bathed in a week and left your indigestion pills at home! Bath? Bath? I'll wash the blood of my enemies from my hands! Tell her. -What? I'll wash the blood of my enemies from my hands! Who's blood? Buckley? Caroline? Kill everyone? The blood of those who hold me back will flow in the streets of Stellendam! Margaret says that we're going to discuss this over dinner. You two can bring this nonsense to an end. Now Buckley wants to grovel? He is begging for mercy! Never! Commandant! -General! Fetch my pills! They're over the cliff! Commandant! -General! Dinner's been arranged and you will come! I'd rather starve in the wilderness! Vultures will pick my bones before I share a table with that wolf! The answer is no! Erika, let's go home. -What's wrong? Let's go home. We haven't even eaten. We can go home first. I hear the enemy... Don't shoot! Its our people! Erika! What are you doing? Why are you all so scared of a bunch of women?? Forward! Erika! Get off the battlefield! Forward! Erika, I'll see you at home! The noise is from behind the hill. Where's Buckley?! Buckley's run away! Kill these pipers and pursue the enemy! Are you insane, de Wet?! Van der Merwe get ready! -We're ready, General! Stay ready then! Lay down your weapons! Hold on until I tell you otherwise! Let go! No don't let go! Do you want me to kill him? Five shillings each, people! You need to pay entry! Send me the bill! -Yes sir but where to? You can't go through! You need to pay! Cross legally! Good try, General! Forward citizens! Get on! -That way! Faster, boys! For kin and fatherland! To the Town Hall! Outta the way, Buckley! Faster! faster! Quickly, around that corner and cut them off! Come, Gen. de Wet! We've captured the English general! Nice one, Commandant! Well done, Koos! A wonderful victory! We showed them a thing or two! What do you want? -Big news, Koos The PM recogises your leadership And Fanie can play tomorrow if you would just sign here. So, you want diplomacy? Its what the PM wanted. Yes. My complements to your Prime Minister. Tell him, as leader of the independent Stellendam I refuse to sign. That's a good one. Its what Buckley said! Now I'm saying it! And I'm leader! But you can't be serious! What about the rugby? South Africa needs your son! And Stellendam needs its father! The PM will be furious! You can go too, Lombard! I've state matters to attend to. You've betrayed your country! You're a traitor! You've sold your country for a bowl of soup! Buckley's cabinet are in a cell. They're next door. He's mad, he won't sign! Please sign, I can't go back to the Prime Minister... Commandant! -Yes, General! This South African is annoying me. Arrest him too and shoot the lot at daybreak! But we're all South Africans! You want to be shot? You can't shoot me! I have diplomatic immunity! Stand with them! Inform their nearest kin of the sentence. And don't forget the eucharist! You won't get away with this! Give me that document! Just sign there please. A pen, naturally! A pen, please! Now he forbids me! Just there. General? -What about khakis? Khakis? -For the rugby, man! I'll ensure the general gets two. I want a hundred for my citizens or no signature! But the price is too high. Its the fourth test! 50 khakis Fine, we'll find a few million just sign there. De Wet! Thank you, Koos! Before you start preaching can we just finalise this please. Come on Hendrik, sign this immediately! Koos, its big news! Big news! You got that cabinet post! v.d. Merwe, will you die with your leader? No thanks, Koos. Not today. I'm off to the rugby. Everthing is set! Begin the drums! Timed and translated by shaunx (cg)
