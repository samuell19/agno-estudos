Can't compare to my Lao Mai Quyen. Trung Binh Tan is the best. What are stances good for? 18 exercises of horse stance! How many would it be when I learn movements? Lower, a bit lower. Keep your back straight. It'll be 36 when it comes to movements. What? 36? Hi teacher Phong. Hi. Martial arts is to build your body… Not to beat people. You say that everyday. You guys find Khoa? We're looking for Khoa to… fly a kite. Has Khoa finished practicing? It's enough for today. Go hang out. Go, quickly. My dad's Hung Ke Quyen is the most powerful here. One day I'll become the number one fighter like him. You're coughing like a rooster. How powerful! Rooster is Ke, just like the movements I've been practicing. Why are you staring at me? Wanna eat the rooster? You pervert. About tomorrow… Shall we… Just friendly. We should do that sometimes… to know where we're at. Come on… Fighting… Fighting. Is he from the city?

Tell your mom to come here. She's in… Tell her not to be shy, come here. I mean, it's only me here. She's in our hometown. - She's in her hometown? - Yes. Now it's me who is embarrassed. Gosh, I thought your mom was here, so… Then? What now? My mom has a letter for you. Geez… Who writes letters nowadays? "Dear Quang," - So lovable. - Yes. "Although you're not my husband, and Khoa, although he's not your son you have to treat him right." What? What does that mean? Hey, behave well. If you ever try drugs, gambling, prostitutes, weed… - I'll beat you up. - Yes. Hey. - Where are you going? - My room. First thing first, one-month deposit, one-month payment, Two million in total.

Wow, great. Hey, wear this. Thanks for your help. - I'm Khanh Trang. - Ah, right… I'm Khoa. Where are we going? Van Lang University. Ah… VL. I'm a sophomore there. Wow… Turns out I'm going to the same school with you, sister. Hey, don't call me elder sister. Girls are sensitive about their age. Ah no, you're still young though. Hey, let's go to the council meeting. Hey, when you return the shirt, come to the Vietnamese Martial Arts club, tell them to pass it to Khanh Trang. Hey, who is that good-looking guy? We just met on the street. A freshman. Really? Cool! Hey, I have to admit, you are a carnivore, any guy with you is beaten up. Cool! Go, Nhat Anh. Hi. Everyone get in your seat, quickly! Hello, Trang's friend, right? - Yeah, hello. - I'm Trang's friend too. What's your name? I'm Anh Khoa Anh Khoa. What? You just called yourself "minh"? "Minh" is for spouses to call their partners or used between lovers. Or you think I'm your spouse? - Right? - I don't mean it. You don't mean it? So sad though. By the way, I'm Nhat Anh. Let's be friends. - Nhat Anh. - Okay Nhat Anh Actually my nickname is "Baby", and I'm younger than you. Can you call me "Baby"? No? You have no chill! Silence, silence please. You guys are all here? Our chairman has said that enrolling in clubs is compulsory for end-of-term evaluation. There are many different clubs for you to choose based on your hobbies, like yoga or aerobics. If you love dancing, join my club. Among all clubs, there is an MMA DC club. MMA is a freestyle martial arts made up of various combat sports and martial arts like boxing, kickboxing, muay, or judo. A full-contact combat sport. The club's chairman is Cao Thien Hoang, a junior. That is our club. What are you doing? Why are you interrupting my speech? How rude! Look at your colorful heads. Go back to your seats! My dear friends, aside from MMA, we also have a Vietnamese Martial Arts club. The club features Vietnam's traditional martial arts, led by martial artist Ba Long, a senior at our school. You guys must have heard about him, right? Is that similar to Binh Dinh Martial Arts? Like this? Wow, You treat me with Binh Dinh's Tre on my first visit to your house? What will I get the next time… I'm gonna eat this… So in love with this. Excellent, yummy. You know what? Vietnamese Martial Arts club features all traditional martial arts in Vietnam. I know everything. You know these guys from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? They're truly Kung Fu masters. They can fight, they can flip, they can fly, they can break walls. Literally they can do everything! - Why does it sound like a thief? - Right. No, no. Here, oh god. Ah! Our school's Cao Thien Hoang. You should focus on this guy, Ba Long. - Hung Ke Quyen. - Exactly. Wow, so cool. Ba Long is great. He's a senior, also a great fighter in our Vietnamese Martial Arts club. Recently, our Vietnamese Martial Arts club and the MMA club had a friendly match. Despite his shoulder injury, Ba Long won by Hung Ke Quyen. This place looks nice. Anyway, my place still has vacancies, want to move there? My place is clean and neat. No, I can't. My mom wants me to live here. Haizz, living alone is unsafe. Right? It's much safer to live with another, right? So silly, come to… Hey Khoa Ah uncle… This is my friend, also my schoolmate. He visits to know where I live, so we can study together. Ah a friend… Hi uncle I'm not married. It's late now so I'm gonna go home. I'm going home now, see you later. I wish you health… OMG, what a headache. Perfect. Hi. Is this the Vietnamese Martial Arts club? What a clown. Don't know. I came to return a shirt to Khanh Trang. Oh… hey… Khanh Trang. Someone must be sneezing right now. Stop! Stop! Why did you come here to fight? Chan, apologize to Long. Sorry. We just passed by to see how your club is training. Here. Hey, keep training, don't let the kids win too soon. Let's go. Bye! You, stay away from Khanh Trang. - Thank you! - Uhm, are you okay? A bit hurt, but it's okay. - Come on, it's our turn now. - Go all the way. They treat us like we are invisible. Gotta show them who's the boss in this school. That's right, Long, go for it. Hoang, stop doing that. Don't come to my brother's place and do that again. How dare I do anything to Long? But… I'll beat any guy you date. Hi… Hey, I'll scream if you don't let me in. No, don't come in. Pervert, rapist, pervert! Huh? How do you know I live here? Nhat Anh, the little bird. Sorry, you were beaten this morning because of me. Try this. It's homemade. Thanks. It's not your fault anyway. I have something for you. Follow me. Hello. - You were in your room? - Yeah. Wow, Casanova. No, this is my schoolmate. She came here so we can study together. I've heard this before. Hello. Tada… My old bike. Just use it for now! Err… Is it a bit too feminine? It's cute, give it a try. OK. Go. Hey Casanova… Don't come home late or you'll stay outside. I know. He's just been here a few days, and he's surrounded by boys and girls. Oh my gosh! Men's talk? Done. You two are really close! I've only known her for a few days though! I'm Long, Trang's brother. This is Tri. Ah yes, Nhat Anh showed me the video before. You won by Hung Ke Quyen. Great win. His shoulder twisted after the win though. - It's fine now. - Bro, Khoa also loves martial arts! I've been into it since I was a kid but have not found any place to study. Especially Vietnamese Martial Arts. It's hard to find young people loving Vietnamese Martial Arts nowadays. Come on. Mom, I have something to say. In an international school, besides English, it's really important to join clubs, like different communities and sports. So I decided to choose Vietnamese Martial Arts. I've told you. It's your passion but you have to care for the people around you. No martial arts. Okay, I know. Bro! Continue. Hello. Everyone comes here. This is Anh Khoa, freshman, our new member. This is Tri, A Lu and Alex. They are my coaching assistants. Hello everyone. If you need any help, just call us two! Who are "us two"? Wanna fight? Remove your hand. - Tell me if anyone bullies you. - Okay. Tell me if someone bullies you. We'll have an inter-school competition in two months. Yeah! We have to win. Yes! We can work hard to achieve that, okay? Okay. Okay… Everyone keep on practicing. Those who seek the peak of a fight Should know the depth of martial arts And master the movement of your body Let the storm be your strike And the floating cloud be your move Shape your mind like water That your enemy will fail to catch Two, three. You're dead wrong. They say, "We all should practice martial arts, so we can protect our homeland at all costs." Okay. Very good. You surprised me. Can I ask something? Ouch, are you okay? I just did the Invisible Kick. You'll learn it one day. Now just hold your stance. A Lu. Do you know when I can learn Hung Ke Quyen? You'll learn when Long teaches you. Now you have to hold your stance. - To control my breath? - Yeah. I've heard that all my life! Really? So you have to wait for your life to end then. You're gonna hear that many times more. Practice your basic techniques, you can't learn any movement without them. I got it. Work hard! I'll go now. I feel stuffy. Darling! Embarrassing. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Wow, what is that powerful movement? Lao Mai Quyen. This is Trang's special secret weapon. Just beat it, not gonna hit me though. - Scared of me now? - Scared? Hell no. Enough, enough, you two. Come here quickly. What are you doing? Why do you guys always stick together? Hey… I really love this… I hope you will teach me. No. I can't teach you this. We'll all die if my brother finds out. "We"? That shouldn't be the case. Should or shouldn't what? Nothing. Long and I are talking about Hoang's MMA competition videos. Do you guys know this channel? You don't need to know. This is the latest video of Hoang fighting the Karate Full Bright team. Watch! Why do I see it as similar to smack down? It's not acting. That is a real fight. If he's fighting like this against our club then… The inter-school competition has its own rules. Don't worry. Don't worry. Hey, it's the perfect time to go swimming. Wanna go? Nhat Anh! Come here. Why do they always show off? Hey, if you won't swim, then go buy me some food. Geez, you're acting like a queen now. Nhat Anh! I've just swum for a while and it is empty now. What? Empty? Ah your stomach? Got it, wait a bit… Why do you keep looking at me? Because… you're beautiful. Wow, didn't expect you to be this flirty. Did it work though? Hey, don't forget my brother is your teacher now! Right. Long treats you so nice. It must be fun when you're home! Not as much as you think. My brother and parents don't get along since they want him to take over my family's business… instead of doing martial arts. Did he do what your parents asked? Of course… not. That's why he's moved out for a few years now. Hey, change the topic. What topic? Then talk about love! You and Hoang, you guys… Are you guys really this curious? Because… I want to know. Okay I'll tell you then. When I first came here last year, he flirted with me. He seems like a cool and handsome guy, so I was into him a bit. But then all he cared about was winning, not to mention his jealousy. He messed up with anyone friending me on Facebook. I didn't feel like we could continue, so we broke up. How about you? Can we be together for a long time? Kidding, we just got to know each other. Huh? I didn't think anything. But I already thought about it. Kidding again… You're so gullible. Hey… Hey, why are you so tense? Huh? Never mind, forget about it. - Jesus! - You scared me. Just like a thief. Learn the Lao Mai Quyen song. Lao Mai Quyen. Apricot blossoms Walking on the cloud Stepping back to stance It's all about inner power. In one year, you can blow out the candles, In a few years, you can tear the clothes. Please. Hey, I told you to focus on your inner power, not powerful fists. Lao Mai is much more powerful than I thought. Of course, I'm not that easy to bully. Think about it carefully. I'll check frequently. This old apricot blossom is difficult as hell. That apricot blossom is "Mai"? Not that simple. The old monkey waits patiently Then suddenly attack Butterflies wander around The moon looks like a hook that you throw Do you know Lao Mai means old monkey in our hometown? Change your leg, see? Turn around, yes… Then, push your body… See? Give me a fulcrum and I will… Here. Wow, fruit. I love you the best. Smooth talker! I have to be one, or you guys won't allow me to dance. Practice like this and you want to win? Like the U13 champion? Sorry, I'm exhausted today. Sorry… Why don't you say sorry on the stage? From now on, you will practice six hours a day. Okay? Hey, there are more fires in buildings recently. I did it! Was I good? Busted! Hey, keep your distance. What are you doing? You're a fast learner! Thank you. Hey, wanna see me perform? There will be many famous underground bands in Saigon to perform at that place tomorrow. You've never watched our performances, right? Okay… Tomorrow! Good? More than good. You've been superb. I was lucky. I've been practicing for a month but still failed. But I still tried anyway, to see how far I can go. Wake up, wake up. Go home. -I LIKE YOU DANCING. - BUT ONLY MY BROTHER SUPPORTS ME. HERE'S A SECRET. MY MOM DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO PRACTICE MARTIAL ARTS EITHER. SHE SAID, ONCE I JOIN, I WON'T STOP FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THEN WE BOTH HAVE SECRETS TO KEEP FROM OUR PARENTS. TEAMHYPER TEAM BAD KID GONNA SLEEP NOW. GOOD NIGHT! You must be happy seeing me perform last night! Unrequited love Sometimes I'm happy to see you smile Do you know that I've fallen for you? Sometimes I'm innocent with you And still telling myself not to confess So we can still be together - God, oh god. - Are you alright? You, you tripped me. - Liar. It was you who tripped us. - What? Hey, that was clueless. I was raising my leg a bit too high. Hey! Vietnamese Martial Arts club is messing with us. Shut up, you guys are too much. Why trip other people? Let's go, I'm afraid they'll bite us, then we have to go for a vaccine. Hey, who are you talking about? - You. - They called us dogs. - Am I wrong though? - You. Let's go. Hey you coward! Trang didn't let you sleep last night? Hey, don't mention her! I like to, so what? Only a freshman and you think you can get the school's hottest girl. - How brave! - What are you talking about? Hey, Vietnamese Martial Arts club hits people! They beat people, they beat people. Don't think I'm easy-going so you can bully me. Chan. Why do you keep messing up? Only because this school is too small. What? You saw that, A club always worshiping sportsmanship now messes around. Oh god, how can you say that? Shut up, stop making things up like that! That was wrong though. Everyone saw he beat Chan. Right? Right? You guys talked about Trang first. I don't know why, but everyone saw you guys beat our people. Now how do you plan to deal with that? This is not related to the Vietnamese Martial Arts club. Okay if you already said so. Let it go, Khoa. I haven't finished yet. I don't want to be known as a freshman bully. So if Khoa can hit me once, I'll let it go. Don't be so clueless. Oh, I forgot to say. - I'm not using my arms though. - Don't need to do that. Let it go Khoa. No fighting. It was because of me. You're afraid that I'll lose? - Khoa. - Let's start. Khoa… Khoa. A friendly match only, okay? Stop. Stop. Sorry, I haven't competed with you for a while. I thought your shoulder had recovered. Do what you want at the competition. Let's go, so Long can rest. Are you okay Khoa? Suddenly you started a fight at school. What would happen to the club's prestige if the school board hears about this? Tri, he was tripped. We can quit the competition, just chill. Hey, don't quarrel. We're all club members. Sorry. Sorry? Do you know how long we have been waiting for this? Stop. Today's session ends early. Everyone goes home. Khoa, stay here with me. I'll boil some eggs you can use later. Fighting. You have quick reactions and raw talent with sharp techniques. But when you meet the strong opponents, you'll die not holding your stance still. Why did you do that? Look at you. I've never seen you this enthusiastic for me. I told you before. Stay away from my beloved! Only a peck on the cheek and he is now your beloved? You stalked me? I just want to know more about him. Trang, he doesn't deserve you. Deserve or not, I'll decide for myself. You keep being like that. Then don't ask me to leave him alone. Hoang. Even if it's not Khoa, I'm not gonna get back with you. I want to know everything about Khoa. I lost to him, and Trang is mad at me. I'm such a failure, Long. - Oh you wanted to win over him? - No, I… 60, 61, 62, 63… 65, 66, 67… It's okay, she was just worried about you. Tired? No… Not a big deal. I've got six packs now. Good, 20 rounds more for set two, so you can get even eight packs. Witty. Hey, why did you step here? I have something to tell you. I can't join the inter-school competition this time. - What, Long? - What are you saying? Long, how can we win over Hoang's team without you? Is it because of your shoulder? I think you should rest for a few days to see how your shoulder will be. I'm really not ready for this competition. I considered carefully, Tri and A Lu are the best two among us, along with Khoa, they will go this time. I believe Khoa is ready. Anh Khoa… Anh Khoa… Anh Khoa. We'll try hard together. Okay. What do you think, Tri? We always trust you. Khoa. I'll try my best to help our club win. Yeah! Cố lên! Hold your stance still. Left fist. Left elbow. Left knee. Do those three, each 1000 times. Huh? That means 3000 times? What? Do you want to win? - Even 6000 is okay. - Good. Use your left even when cleaning or doing anything! Even when eating and masturbating? No, you have to use your right then. Why? The left to click the mouse. Click the mouse? You talkative bastards, get out! Why did you hit him so hard? Now you lost the chance to compete with him. He was so wrong to let that kid replace him though. He wants to embarrass you. - Even more fun - What? 2997..2998… 2999… 3000 This is Bui Thi Xuan's Song Phuong Kiem, right? Not bad. Leave that for me I'm not gonna go easy on a younger guy. You're not easy on older guys like me either. I like you already! Don't worry. My girl, my girl 2997… 2998… 2999… 3000 What are you doing? Go home. If you keep avoiding me, I'm gonna scream. Ah, pervert, rapist. Up, go go! Are you insane? My parents are gonna kill me! What happened? Nothing, I'm watching a horror movie. Turn down the volume, it's late now. Okay. You're so good at imitating me. I didn't know you were that stubborn. Because I wanted to see you. For? Ah… see you to thank you. I know that treatment gel was yours. Well… There are many guys in the club, maybe it was from Alex. But… it was the same brand as the one Long used. Homemade gel has no brand though… Okay… you already thanked me, now go home… Umm, sorry about the other day! Umm, you said sorry, now go home. Hoang tried to. So he provoked me the other day, who could stand that? So you started to hit him for being provoked? I know it's my fault! What? I miss that kiss. Miss that kiss… Why is it so noisy? It was hot so I went for some air. - Be careful though. - Yes. Okay. Go to sleep soon, mom! Keep making mistakes Because you're allowed to Keep loving although we're silly A Lu's Ngoc Trang Ngan Dai is a Vietnamese Martial Arts movement. It contains all the basic things of traditional martial arts. So I decided to let Khoa compete with Tri today. Why is that? Why do they compete with each other but you tell me to warm up? Don't be mad. Back to your seat. I'm not mad. It's like I'm here for your entertainment. These guys are so special. Sit here then. Khoa and Tri come here. Interesting! Start! Huh? Why does it look like my Song Phuong Kiem? He stole my Ngoc Trang Quyen already. Tri's weakness is that he follows the movements, but Miu Quyen is very flexible. Wild cats are not easy to bully. You guys were great. I know you love Hung Ke Quyen. So do you know why it is powerful? Yeah, Hung Ke Quyen attacks from every direction, 3-4 strikes at 1 point. My dad was very passionate about this. Come here. Hung Ke Quyen was invented by Nguyen Lu, king of Eastern Conquering. And was put into training for Tay Son soldiers at that time. It's deadly and is one of the quintessential martial arts in Binh Dinh. However, Vietnamese Martial Arts always praise sportsmanship and encourage people to stop in-time. That is the spirit of Vietnamese people that I need to promote. Try your best! Yeah Hey, are you thinking about some girl? No, the competition is tomorrow. I'm just worried. Don't worry… Now you're even better than me! I like your Hung Ke Quyen! To be honest, every time talking about Hung Ke Quyen, I miss my dad. He lost a match. His pneumonia then got serious and he passed away. Since then my mom banned me from learning martial arts. Just try your best tomorrow. Don't overthink! Hello my loves, I'm at the inter school competition now. I'm very excited. You know why? See? It's very crowded here. Now we're gonna interview some people to know what they're thinking. Come on. Hi, how do you feel now? - Ah, I think… - Okay okay. Oh my gosh, they are very touched and speechless right now. Oh my god, see? It's very exciting here. DC THE CHAMPION Khoa! Fighting! I know you're very excited, but you have to stay calm and focused. Safety first, okay? - Yeah. - Okay, warm up now. Ladies and gentlemen, and The Inter School Competition. Starts… now… Lu… Are you okay? Not only ugly, but also useless. - I was hit, not useless. - Sit up. Oh, I'm dizzy from the hit. Are you guys ready? And the first round of the Inter School Competition starts now. Ba Cuong is eliminated because of his unsportsmanlike conduct. Duc Tri won. - Stay away. - Yes. - Get the splint. - Yes. Stop, why do you keep beating after the whistle is blown? Sorry. What do you hit like? You guys collude with each other right? What are you saying? Don't defame other people. What are you saying? All clubs please stay calm. If any has rowdy conduct, the candidates will be disqualified. Hear that? You want to be eliminated? Go back. - Who got hit? - No, no one This one got hit. I thought it was painful so I just screamed. Sorry, I let you down. They were unsporting to Tri to give them the advantage to win. You can do it, right? VIETNAMESE MARTIAL ARTS - THE CHAMPION FINAL ROUND - THIEN HOANG Only knew you for a while and you surprised me so many times, Khoa. What do you want? Turns out your dad is Tran Anh Phong. That's none of your business. Is it? Notice that man? Is he the one who beat your dad? My dad has come here to see your Hung Ke Quyen. And now is the first semi-final between Tran Anh Khoa from Vietnamese Martial Arts club and Cao Chan from the DC MMA club. Is this your Hung Ke Quyen? Is this your Hung Ke Quyen? Even his dad lost, so he'll lose too. - My dad didn't lose. - He died, so he lost. My dad didn't lose, my dad didn't lose. Khoa. Stand up, stay focused. Stand up! Stand up! Khoa! My dad didn't lose! My dad didn't lose! My dad didn't lose! Khoa. Khoa, Stop. What are you doing? Khoa! Khoa, are you out of your mind? Violating the rules of the tournament, Anh Khoa is eliminated. Khoa. - Khoa, what's happened? - Let me go, don't follow me. Khoa. Khoa. What do you want? I don't want you to repeat my mistake. So you're regretting it now after killing people? If I were the murderer, you were the partner in crime then. If you hadn't distracted him, I was beaten. I couldn't accept my failure back then. I lost my control. I've been haunted by that all these years. I lost my control and my sportsmanship. And I believe, teacher Phong wouldn't want you to repeat that. I won't fight, I won't fight anymore. I won't allow you to learn martial arts, got it? Okay. Thank you. Sorry. This time I won faster than expected. This is not the proper way to win. Winning is too easy for me. You knew from the start this cup would be mine. One day, your competitiveness will kill you like me. You can lose, but I can't. Why? Why are you here? Want my congratulations? Trang, that guy doesn't deserve you. You're gloating right? I didn't do anything? He lost by himself. He couldn't stand the pressure and had to go back to his place. But it was just a game, Khoa isn't that kind of person. Not that kind of person? He lost control when seeing my dad. He's still mad at my dad for winning over his dad. How do you know that? I told you I'll know what I want to know. So you invited your dad there on purpose. You tripped Tri and then Khoa. Now you're going back to your mean self. Don't you see the gap between me and him? I do. You'll do anything just to be number one, I'm always number two. Khoa is different. You would trade anything just to be number one, I'm always number two. This is not the proper way to win. Those who seek the peak of a fight Should know the depth of martial arts - Mom, I… - I know everything. Sorry. No, it's okay. I'm a disgraceful son. Dad died because of me. What are you talking about, Khoa? Cao Hung told me everything. Cao Hung? I'm also sorry about this. I'll fund Khoa to finish college. I hope I can help you a bit. I hope you won't reject this for his good. Think about that, if your dad hit him hard and caused any trouble, his son would hate our family forever. This is much better, right? Khoa, if your dad didn't hurt anyone for your sake, we have to be happy about that. Right? - But… - I know, I left the feather duster inside. Go burn incense sticks for your dad. Okay. You, come here too. Dad, you taught me martial arts to build my body, but I wasn't strong enough. I don't deserve to be your son. You heard him. Now I will punish him on your behalf. You'll have to eat four bowls of rice. - Don't say no - Okay! So… Tai! I think it's my fault too. So please punish me by eating 6 bowls! Okay. What are you doing there? Give me a hand! Yes! Miss your dad? Yeah, I miss him practicing martial arts, doing Hung Ke Quyen. Your dad is respected not only for his mastery, but also his manner. That's what made me fall for him too. We still have one final. This is the Bau Da wine I made. I plan to save that for Khoa's wedding. Ah, then keep it, it's no occasion today. Yes, you're having a match tomorrow, so drink some to get energy. Didn't you hear that? You should go to the match tomorrow. Huh? Didn't you ban him from martial arts? If you don't have any other thoughts but martial arts, then competing to see where you are is good. I got it. Thanks, mom. Drink. Know your limits, son. I know, don't worry. - Khoa, where are you going? - Brother Long. Long, sorry for bothering you guys. We all know everything. Long and I came here to cheer for you. Try your best. Long, I'll go alone this time! Okay, I understand. Trang, I'm sorry. I was angry back then. Be careful. Hung Ke Quyen! I'll do my best. You'd better do it. You lost your right arm, stop. This is enough. You have quick reactions and raw talent with sharp techniques. But when you meet the strong opponents, you'll die not holding your stance still. Left elbow… and left knee. Vietnamese martial arts are like Vietnamese people. The stronger opponents we face, the stronger we get. - Nice move. - You too. You can compete with me again anytime. Yeah! Yeah, excellent! you're brilliant Khoa. To be honest, I was very worried, so I kept this wrench to use if something happened. But it's unnecessary now. You're so great. - Are you okay? - I'm alright. Mom, Long. Good job, kiddo. Hoang, you did well too. I'll let you know, don't be so arrogant. We'll know who's better at 5 p.m. We can even wait till dusk. Then wait here, I'm gonna go home. Nonsense, we're talking about Hoang and Khoa. What are you saying? 5 p.m. what? I thought it was about the lottery. Hey look who came. Oh my darling is back. It's been a while. Oh, my darling is here… Why do you look so gross now? Oh, blood… Everyone, blood… It's okay, as long as you came back. But you must have lost by the look of it. Don't be so rude. You're so rude. Then who's the winner? Here. Draw. No no, I don't accept that. I'm very competitive. We have to win. But don't be disappointed though. What? What? - Ah, we just accidentally held hands. - Accidentally… Accidentally, accidentally… So accidentally, holding hands. You're in love, right? Don't deny it. There's nothing to be shy about, just confirm it. Oh, they love each other. The girl is older though. What do you mean? You mean I'm old? No no you got it wrong. I said you're like his sister, backing up for him when he falls. Wanna fight? You come out here. You're dead to me! How dare you!
