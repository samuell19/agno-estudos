[ominous music] [music continues] [computer clicks and whines] [engines rumbling] [music continues] What? I was just wondering why you didn't keep those in the other truck with the missiles. Trevors and Saunders are keeping watch back there. No offense, Sergeant Bartlett, but I don't know you and I don't know your team. What's that supposed to mean? It means that the guidance chips in this case'll make those weapons we just intercepted find your mother's house with pin-point accuracy and wipe it off the map. So a little precaution goes a long way, if you catch me drift. See, kid? Spend enough years in the service, this is what happens to ya. I'm just planning on doing two tours, Sergeant. Then I'm out. See? Beasley's got the right idea. Look like we're all fucked up hanging around, huh? You don't like your job, do something about it. [suspenseful music] What do you think you're doing? I'm just having a look. Well, don't. Chill out. Won't do harm. Fuck me. I could bling up my whole bathroom in this lot. Why would you wanna do that? So I can shit... on a golden throne. Why the fuck wouldn't you wanna do that? Because I'm not a 10-year-old. [engine revs] - [computer whines] - [tense music] [Soldier on radio] I see multiple tangos coming in from the northeast. Roger that. Get ready to knock their lights off and then floor it. I can't see shit! What's the plan? Over. We don't flinch until we know we have to. Out. These are the priority. The missiles are useless without 'em. Don't worry, everything's gonna be just... [crashing] [rapid gunfire] [bullets clang] [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] - [bullet clangs] - [dramatic music] [rapid gunfire] [groans] - [bullets clang] - [rapid gunfire] Bartlett, are you hit? Guys? Shit. [rapid gunfire] - [bullets clang] - [rapid gunfire] - [bullets clang] - [gunfire continues] Where the fuck is everyone? Dead, I think. [bullets clang] Beasley, wait! - [guns fire] - [thudding] [tense music] - [bullets clang] - [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] [bullets whizzing] [rapid gunfire] [flesh squelches] [groans] [grunts] [wind whistling] - [sighs] - [somber music] Fuck. [sighs] Oh, piece... Oh, fucking Comstar. [wind whistling] How's it going? Yo! Just counting bullets. Again. We need to find another game, man. Stop smoking. [tense music] [thud] [shivers] - [wind whistling] - [suspenseful music] [hushed chatter in foreign language] [grunts] [gun cocks] There's no need for any more violence. Everything's gone to plan. [Bartlett] Amir! I wouldn't call this going to plan, Amir. Who's this? This is the one you were supposed to let run off and live! Well, who did we just let go then? You just let the guy with the fucking guidance chips go! I told you to shoot the old one! You all look the same! [speaks foreign language] Okay, relax. He's injured, he's on foot. We'll get him back. Well, you better, 'cause if you wanna sell these missiles to your buyer, we need that case. It's fine, I'll handle this. [Amir speaks foreign language] What the fuck are we gonna do? Beasley telling everyone we're dead was our way of getting away with this. Now what? As far as anyone's gonna know, Amir stole the missiles. We're just MIA. [engine roars] [somber music] [sighs] [line rings] Hello? Hello? Oh, God damn signal. [Woman on phone] Rana, are you there? Yeah, I can hear you. How are you guys? [Woman] Same as always, really. You? Bored. The whole unit is out protecting a main road. It's election day coming up. [Woman] And they didn't take you? Nope. How's the money situation? [Woman] Not great. The pensions office are considering Dad's appeal, so we've just gotta wait. I've got three jobs now which is killing me. It's ridiculous. As if Dad's fought all those years just to get no pension. I'll figure something out. [Woman] How? You're in the exact same boat as him, dumb-arse. Oh, come on. It's not like that. [Woman] Oh, yeah? You're gonna steal a tank and sell it or something? No. [Woman] Well, shut up then. [phone bleeps] Hello? Hello? No, please. Come on. Fucking shit. [sighs] Oh, give me a fucking break. [wind whistling] Good day, sweetheart? Yep. Well... Better than getting shot at, I suppose. I emptied out the magazines for ya, so you've got something to do. Counting rounds all night. Great. You wanna know how many there is? I don't like spoilers. There's 400. Fuck off, Gaje. [sighs] 397. 398. 399. Oh, come on. Bastard. Okay. [distant clangs] [distant goat bleats] [suspenseful music] [wind whistles] [gun fires] This is a British base! I will shoot you! Don't shoot! We're on the same side! I need help, please. I've got the Taliban tracking me. They're heading this way. How many? How many what? Taliban. How many? I'll just pop back and count, shall I? I don't know, loads! I'm sorry to bring this to your doorstep, I really am, but my problem is about to become your problem very quickly. Are you injured? Hit in the side, no exit wound. I don't mean to rush you, mate, but you're gonna have to take a leap of faith with this one, it's now or never. How many rounds you got? Just the one mag. I'm gonna grab my ammo first. Get your stuff together and let's go hide. Hide? Where are the rest of your men? Not here, me and the guy asleep are all you've got. Fuck me. You guys have working coms, right? Sort of, the signal comes and goes. Just needs to last long enough to get an evac call out. Where is it? We can use the coms unit in that Humvee over there. - [computer clicks and whines] - [suspenseful music] [engine revs] [tires screech] [engine revs] What about these guys? We keep quiet. We make the call. Then I say we just fucking kill 'em. Works for me. [music continues] How bad are you hurt? I'll be fine. Keep low. Gonna need to get this bullet out of me fairly soon. You want the radio or surgery? Radio. [static hisses] Fuck sake. Let me guess, you need a new service provider, right? Yeah. I'm gonna have to go and restart the box. Where's that? Tower. Course it is. That's gonna be pretty difficult. Okay. Well? Well, I'm just gonna have to go for it. Hey, what's your name? Rana. I'm Noah. [suspenseful music] [groans] [sighs] [peaceful music] [Woman on recording] Let's start this meditation to remind you that your true self is a non-smoker. Feel the healthy energy flow through you. You are the mountains. You feel relaxed. You feel calm. You feel strong. Breathe. Well done for doing this meditation to remind you that you are a healthy non-smoker. - [suspenseful music] - [wind whistles] - [rapid gunfire] - [groans] [music continues] - [shouting indistinctly] - [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] [dramatic music] [distant gunfire] - [rapid gunfire] - [grunts] [Gaje groans] [rapid gunfire] Shit. - [switch clicks] - [static hisses] Fuck it. - [rapid gunfire] - [bullets clang] [groans] [rapid gunfire] - [flesh squelches] - [groans] [rapid gunfire] [flesh squelches] - [somber music] - [pants] Gaje. Gaje. [sighs] [coughs] I know. I told them for you. [music continues] [grunts] Let's get that bullet out of you. [wind whistling] [grunts] Okay. Okay. [breathing heavily] Fuck. [grunts] Okay. This is gonna hurt. Oh, you think? It's not my first rodeo. Come on. Up. Okay. [Rana] Right. [inhales sharply] Your hands are cold. - Special Forces. - What about us? You guys love shooting each other. Just get on with it. - Ready? - Uh-huh. And in. - [flesh squelches] - [Noah grunts] - [Noah] Oh, fuck. - [Rana] All right. - [sighs] - All better? Oh, yeah, I feel great. Speak to the nurse on your way out. She'll give you a lollipop for being a good boy. That's cute. Listen. I'm sorry about your friend. Thanks. He was a good guy. Yeah. [chuckles] I'd drink to that, but I'm out. Wanna tell me why he died? Why are they after that? [tense music] They're guidance chips for some pretty serious missiles that me and my squad were transporting. We intercepted them being sold on the black market. Along with a lot of gold. Shit. Then we were ambushed on the way back. They killed the squad. I managed to get out with those. The missiles are useless without 'em. Titanium-cased, so they can't be smashed. Each one's got an individual tracker, so even if we hide 'em they're gonna find 'em eventually. So it's nowhere near over is what you're telling me? That's kind of what I'm telling you. Any ideas? We get in a truck and we drive as far as we can. Yeah, right. This whole region is Taliban. We'd be dead in a few hours. That leaves Plan B. Plan B? There's a satellite phone on the truck where I came from. Where the missiles are? Uh-huh. Where the Taliban are? Uh-huh. Oh, Jesus. You know, I'd totally volunteer to go meself, but, I've kinda got a hole in me. Should patch it up. Fine. Show me where to go. Okay. [suspenseful music] [computer whines and clicks] [computer whines and clicks] [wind whistles] [whispers] What the fuck? [panting] [sighs] [door creaks] [muffled clunks] [suspenseful music] [gun cocks] [wind whistles] [distant grunts] [Saunders] It's taking way too fucking long. [man] Oh, quit your fucking whining. Bartlett says it's fine, then it's fine. I'll make sure they put that on your grave when they hang us for treason. [music continues] [phone bleeps] [tense music] [sighs] [tense music] - [dramatic music] - [Noah groans] - [thuds] - [grunts] [man screams] - [thuds] - [groans] - [man grunts] - [flesh squelches] [knife clangs] - [thuds] - [groans] [gun clicks] [grunts] - [thud] - [both grunting] [glass shatters] - [flesh squelches] - [grunts] [Noah pants] - [phone rings] - [wind whistles] [phone beeps] [suspenseful music] That was HQ, guys. This is getting too risky now. - Sage. - What? Shut the fuck up. No, he's right. Look, we've got the gold. The missiles are a dead end. I think we need to start talking about splitting it and getting the fuck out of here. We should at least put it to a vote. - I'd be up for that. - No one's voting on anything. We wait. Let these lot retrieve the chips. We're not blowing our cover for the sake of a few extra hours. And what happens when our newfound friends start getting all trigger happy in our direction, eh? They won't. Famous last words. Yeah, well, in the meantime, what're we gonna do about HQ? I'll go and speak to Amir, get him to hurry the fuck up. [wind whistles] [Amir spits] [speaking indistinctly] [tense music] [pants] [Soldier] The sat phone's gone! Fuck. [Bartlett] Saddle up, the situation's changed. We're going after him. [Amir speaks foreign language] [engines start] [wind whistles] [tense music] [Rana sighs] [Rana] What happened to you? Fair enough. [sighs] By the way. Your squad. They're not dead. What? Well we've got to go back, we've got to rescue them. No, they're not dead because they're working with these guys to sell those missiles. That doesn't make any sense. Well, I mean, sure. Why would a bunch of highly-trained, underpaid soldiers want to steal a load of gold and sell a few missiles? I overheard them talking. They're all coming here, by the way. - How many? - I don't know. So hurry up and make the call. [sighs] Fucking Afghanistan. I swear to God, if I never see another mountain again, it's gonna be too soon. [tense music] The lookout. It should give you enough height to call out. Okay, how many rounds we got? - [object clatters] - [grunts] 250 rounds. We've gotta make 'em count. [muffled engines roar] Oh, come on. Looks like they're here. I don't get paid enough for this. We don't do this for the money. Yeah, tell me about it. - [suspenseful music] - [wind whistles] It's your phone, you go and get it. Let's get something really clear. - [gun clicks] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't like you, and I don't like your shitty little country, either. And I certainly don't trust ya. So if you want these missiles like we agreed, then you go in there. Stop 'em from using that sat phone and get the chips back. Me and my men will be right here protecting this truck. Do I make myself clear? You know, it's a good job I like you. Don't worry, we'll handle this. [bangs truck] [speaks foreign language] [engine revs] Johnson, get up there on that high point with your rifle. You get a clear shot on Noah, you take it. Don't hesitate. [Johnson] Roger that. [Bartlett] You lot, guard the truck. These fucks are gonna try and screw us the second they get their hands on those chips. I just wanna retire. [engine roars] [suspenseful music] We've got company, lots of it. Let's show 'em what we think of uninvited guests. You're an uninvited guest. True. Fucking Gurkhas. We know this place is empty! Your entire unit's on patrol, 40 miles west of here! So at best there's maybe two or three of you left? Just hand over the soldier and we'll just leave! There's no need to die for no reason. [tense music] In position. No sign of target. Received. Keep eyes on Amir, too. Roger that. [Amir speaks foreign language] [Amir speaks foreign language] [Amir shouts in foreign language] Target sighted with one other. Take 'em both out. Roger that. [gun fires] Where did that come from? Sniper. Johnson, at a guess. Well, I think Johnson is a prick. Just so you know. You and me both. [gun fires] You should make a run for the lookout. I'll head the other way and draw their fire. You're laying down your life for a noble cause? Thinking about it. Wait until they all follow me and then you go. Okay. [gun fires] - [alarm wails] - [rapid gunfire] - [flesh squelches] - [groans] [music continues] Johnson, what's happening? I'm getting itchy feet here. I've lost Noah. I think he's heading for the lookout. Over. Does he have the sat phone? Say again. Over. Does he have the fucking sat phone? Amir and his men are heading your way. I repeat, Amir and his men are heading your way. Everyone keep your eyes peeled. Oh, fuck this. Going for a look around. I'll go after Noah and the chips. Out. [alarm continues blaring] - [man groans] - [thuds] - [rapid gunfire] - [bullets clang] [groans] Are you telling me one Gurkha is causing all this fucking carnage? I have got to meet this guy. Johnson, are you receiving? Over. [static crackles] What? I see movement. I don't see it. It's right... [flesh squelches] [rapid gunfire] [bullets clang] Find the hanger. Get the merch switched into a new truck, be back in 10. Where the fuck are you going? I'm gonna kill Amir. [grunting] - [thud] - [groans] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [flesh squelches] - [groans] [rapid gunfire] [alarm blares] [rapid gunfire] Come on! [rapid gunfire] [gun fires] [suspenseful music] Amir! Don't shoot! Okay, that was a mistake. But we still have business to attend to. How so? You need me to finish the sale. My buyer will only meet if I'm alive. Do you know what, Amir? I'll find another buyer. [gun fires] - [rapid gunfire] - [bullets clang] Akon zero alpha, this is akon two zero. Are you receiving? Over. Akon zero alpha, this is akon two zero. Are you receiving? Over. [Soldier on radio] Akon two zero, this is akon zero alpha. Send your message. Over. My unit has switched, I repeat, my unit has switched. Are you hearing this? [Noah on radio] They're attempting to sell the missiles to the Taliban. I still have the guidance chips, though. Multiple tangos are within my location. Requesting immediate evac. Over. [Soldier on radio] We've tracked your location... [drowned out by gunfire] Repeat that? Did you say eight-zero minutes? - [rapid gunfire] - [radio static hisses] Fucking... This doesn't change anything. This fucking changes everything. They know what we've done now, how're we gonna explain that? I'm thinking. [rapid gunfire] [rapid gunfire] We need to go in there, kill these fuckers and get out of here. Will you two pair of pricks just shut the fuck up and let me think? Go and get Espinosa! [computer clicks and whines] Jesus Christ. I nearly killed you. Good to see you too. [grunts] - Rough night? - [sighs] You could say that. Taliban are all dead. I saw. Did you make the call? Yeah. 80 minutes. [sighs] Great. Especially now. I'm out of rounds. Me too. [groans] Look. All we have to do is keep the chips safe and hidden for long enough. There are some tunnels under the base we've got. In case of air strikes. That could work. The entrance is inside one of the containers in the yard. We need the keys in the rec room though. Right. No time like the present. [grunts] [suspenseful music] [groans] [groans] Shit. How bad is it? I'll live. [Johnson] I wouldn't count on it. [gun fires] [tense music] You're out! [Johnson] Yeah. But I got lot more left in me. Have you? Nah. [grunts] I'm pretty much done to be honest. But I do have him. - [grunts and thuds] - [dramatic music] [Johnson yells] [groans] [grunts] [groans] [wood clatters] [spits] - [blade whooshes] - [both grunting] - [thuds] - [grunts] [grunts] - [thuds] - [grunts and groans] - [bones crack] - [flesh squelches] [Johnson groans] - [flesh squelches] - [groans] [shouting indistinctly] [flesh squelches] [groans] [pants] [Rana sighs] You know, the next time you visit... Uh-huh? Call first. [wind whistling] [suspenseful music] [wind whistles] [distant clunks] Get inside. The entrance to the tunnels is at the back of the container. What about you? Someone's gotta save your ass. Just go. Pull the hatch down and keep these safe. Try not to die. Yeah. You too. [door creaks] [dark music] [grunts and pants] [groans] [pants] [tense music] Where's Noah? I don't know. Okay. [thud] [wind whistling] Oi! We got you a present. - The chips? - What? [Bartlett] Where are the fucking chips? There was no sign of Noah or the chips, but my guess is this little prick knows where the both of them are. Right, go and get him tied down. I'll be there in a minute. Trevors, when you're done, go and help Sage get them missiles moved from that old truck into this one. I wanna be out of here in the next 60, you understand? Yes, sir. Get a move on. [Sage grunts] Good morning, sunshine. - [thud] - [blood splatters] - [thud] - [Rana groans] I don't think there's any need for that. What do you think? [sighs] I think you better hope she tied these ropes well. Because if I get out of this chair, I'm gonna kill you with it. [Bartlett chuckles] You know what I see when I look in your eyes? Sorry, pal. You're not my type. I see zero fear. Not remotely scared, are ya? It comes with the training. [spits] [Espinosa hums] Still nothing. - [thud] - [Rana groans] How about now? [Rana sighs] Fascinating. You guys really are tough as fuck, aren't you? [breathing heavily] So... I'm gonna kill her first. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [chuckles] And then I'm gonna shove her head up your ass. [chuckles] - [thud] - [grunts] [chuckles] We've actually got a lot in common, me and you. I had a little look 'round your stuff. Hope that's okay. Your old man was a Gurkha too, I take it. How's retirement going for him? [sighs] Don't talk about him. Let me guess. The army's not covering the bills now he's not out there risking his life for them anymore. Struggling to make ends meet. Barely covering the rent. And you're out here doing the exact same thing. The sad fucking truth is, you're going to end up in the exact same boat. Broke and begging for handouts. Does that seem right to you? You risk your life for your country, your father risks his too, and for what? Doesn't that make you angry? See? We're the same. So are all my guys. Where's our reward for taking bullets so some snot-nosed little cunt can sleep safe at night knowing he'll never have to see the shit we do? We're just taking things into our own hands. Looking after our own. Is that really so bad? You've got no honor. Is honor gonna keep your dad warm this winter? Is it gonna clothe your children? Is it gonna pay your fuckin' electricity bills? Honor is the lie they sell to you, beat into you, all so you'll fight tooth and nail to protect the status quo so they can stay rich and you can stay expendable. And when you're too old to fight anymore, they slap a little badge on ya and tell you it's for honor. And then they leave you to rot. I can offer you something better. I can change your family's whole lives. [bar clunks] There's plenty more where this came from. All you gotta do is show us where Noah and the chips are. We'll go and you can live happily ever after. [tense music] I've got a call to make. Get this gold moved over. We'll have the chips in the next 10. [Rana groans] [wind whistles] It's me. Amir's dead. [Buyer on radio] Then the deal is off. No, wait. Still got the chips and the missiles. No need to tank a good deal over one dead middleman. [Buyer] Okay. Come alone, or there is no deal. But my squad... [Buyer] I lose men, you should lose men. You want the money, then you have a deal, but come alone or don't come at all. [flashlight clicks] [suspenseful music] [Rana grunts] [groans] [Espinosa] Where? I don't know. I didn't come in here with him. If you're fucking with me, I'll put a bullet in your head. Right here. [Rana grunts] [rope creaks] [distant clanking] Noah? [guns cock] Look, just come out. Mm? You can't win this. Look. Let us help you. We don't wanna have to kill you any more than you wanna kill us. - [grunts] - I am more than willing to kill you. - [grunts and groans] - [thuds] [shouts] - [rapid gunfire] - [grunts] - [grunts] - [thuds] [rapid gunfire] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [flesh squelches] - [Trevors screams] [rapid thuds] [pants and grunts] She got away with the case. She's got the chips, it's over. [somber music] [Rana sighs] No. It's not over. My grandfather would have given his life for honor. So would my father, and so will I. These tunnels, they lead straight to the storage hanger. We can still stop them. You're fucking crazy, you Gurkhas. You know that, right? Yeah. We know. [music swells and intensifies] [Espinosa] Bartlett! You're injured. [Espinosa scoffs] Yeah. And they killed Trevors. I can see that. Those the chips? Yeah. All of them? Yeah, I think so. Thank fuck for that. [chuckles] Can you drive? [suspenseful music] Yeah. [chuckles] Where's Sage? Oh, yeah. I killed him. [gun fires] Last one. Don't miss. I won't. [gun cocks] Don't shoot me either. I'll do me best. [muffled clunks] [sighs] Fuck sake. [gun cocks] [suspenseful music] Looks like our deal's off then, eh? Come on, boys. Let's not play hide and seek. We can handle this like men. - [gun fires] - [tense music] [whistling] - [dramatic music] - [grunts] - [rapid gunfire] - [grunts] [screams] [Rana groans] - [thuds] - [grunts] [all grunting] [screams] - [thuds] - [groans] - [thuds] - [grunts] [groans] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [Rana grunts] - [Noah grunts] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [flesh squelches] - [Noah screams] - [thuds] - [grunts] - [thuds] - [grunts] [thud] [chuckles] Look at you both. You're about to die in the middle of fucking nowhere. For what? [steel scrapes] - [grunts] - [dramatic music] - [thuds] - [grunts] [grunts] [knife clangs] [thud] [grunts] [grunts] [suspenseful music] [knife clangs] You know, I don't take any pleasure from this. - [thuds] - [grunts] - [thuds] - [grunts] You should've taken the gold. [Rana groans] [tense music] Why don't you just give up? Because I've got honor. - [grunts] - [rapid thuds] - [grunts] - [rapid thuds] [grunts] - [rapid sharp thuds] - [grunts] [flesh squelches] [Bartlett groans] [gun fires] [flesh squelches] - [Noah and Rana panting] - [somber music] Thank you. You didn't have to do any of this. Yes. I did. [wind whistling] [helicopter blades whir] We good? Give us a second, lads, yeah? [somber music] [Rana sighs] Well, that's it, then. That's it. I guess. You sure you don't wanna come with us? Get some proper medical attention? Well... I suggest you check under your mattress after we leave. Why is that? Just do it. You're not gonna try and kiss me now, are ya? [helicopter blades whir] Captain Brand. I need to ask you some questions. Yes, sir. [Rana groans] The gold in the back of the truck. The initial Intel we had, there should've been a few more. Did a full sweep of the area. Couldn't find anything. Do you know anything about that? No, sir. Not a thing.
