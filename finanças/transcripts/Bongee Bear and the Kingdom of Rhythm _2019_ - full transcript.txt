The villagers of the kingdom were a kind and gentle people. A beautiful day, Tyler. Indeed, Gary. How is the bakery business today? On the rise. And how are you today, Brittany? Wonderful.

Bravo. They were ruled by the good King Jason and his wife, Queen Catherine. They were fair and kind rulers who had kept peace in the land for many years and were loved by all their subjects. Even the evil witch, Bandrilla, did not bother them for she too liked King Jason and Queen Catherine. Bandrilla lived on the other side of the magic forest, high atop Skull Hill and for centuries she had struck fear in the hearts of the people of the kingdom. The animals of Wonder have two special powers. They can talk and they like the people of the kingdom love to dance. Every 100 years, these powers are renewed at a special and magical ceremony. - The festival of Mijon. - That's correct, Mike. Very good. All the animals of the forest must join together and perform a special dance. And they are bestowed with another 100 years of speech and dance for themselves and their descendants. When this story takes place, the festival was just 11 short years away. One day King Jason made a wonderful announcement to the people of the kingdom. And this is where our story really begins. My friends, I have tremendous news to share with you. Catherine and I are going to have a child. Let the bells ring throughout the land. Word of the joyous news spread quickly. When the blessed day arrived, gifts were brought from far and wide. The two most unusual gifts came from the animals of Wonder Hollow. Welcome. Hello, we wish to see the King and his new family. We bear gifts for them. Of course. Follow me. Welcome to the Kingdom of Rhythm. Your Highness, the animals of Wonder. It's so good to see you. Oh, it's always good to see the two of you. Congratulations, your Highness. We, the animals of Wonder Hollow share in your happiness and we wish to present the princess with two gifts. May I? Of course, my friend. This is Princess Katrina. The first gift is this water. It comes from the brook, which flows within the magic forest. It's called love book because by bathing our newborns there, they grow up with a love for all things and we wish to share this gift of love with Princess Katrina. Thank you, Mindy. This is the second gift. This is Bongee Bear. Bongee's parents passed away recently leaving him an orphan. He wishes to remain here at the castle and protect Princess Katrina as she starts to make her way on this journey we call life. We accept your wonderful gift of the water. And to you Bongee Bear, welcome to your new home. Yes. Welcome to the Kingdom of Rhythm. On behalf of Princess Katrina, we thank you all. And Bongee, since you will be one of the protectors of the princess, I would like to present you with something. Guard, could you hand me one of the special bibs, please? Yes, your majesty. I, King Jason, ruler of the Kingdom of Rhythm hereby proclaim you Bongee Bear protector of the princess. I guess we'll have to shorten it a little for you. No, your majesty. It's perfect. I will protect her with my life. ♪ As we wander through this life ♪ ♪ And meet so many souls ♪ ♪ There are friends along the way ♪ ♪ That help us meet our goals ♪ ♪ No matter how time flies ♪ ♪ There's always one so true ♪ ♪ The one who truly cares ♪ ♪ The one that's there for you ♪ ♪ That special friend ♪ ♪ Who's there through thick and thin ♪ ♪ That special friend who can make your frown a grin ♪ ♪ That special friend you were always meant to be ♪ ♪ That special friend ♪ ♪ When life takes us by surprise ♪ ♪ As it often seems to do ♪ ♪ You're right there by my side ♪ ♪ To help me make it through ♪ ♪ Through the laughter and the tears ♪ ♪ There's one thing that I know ♪ ♪ I can always count on you ♪ ♪ And our bond will always grow ♪ ♪ That special friend ♪ ♪ Who's there through thick and thin ♪ ♪ That special friend who can make your frown a grin ♪ ♪ That special friend ♪ ♪ You were always meant to be that special friend ♪ ♪ That's special friend ♪ ♪ That's special friend ♪ What you doing, Papa?

Oh boy, I love the celebration of Rhythm. Everybody in the land comes, but why do you send out invitations? Everyone knows it's open to all. Because it's the proper thing to do, dear. We want everyone to feel special. Okay, I gotta go tell Bongee. See ya! You must go tell Bongee, not you gotta go. And see you, not see ya. And don't slam the... Door. Sorry, Father. What are we going to do with her? Oh, she'll be fine, dear. I seem to remember your mother telling me what a handful you were when you were Katrina's age. Well, that's beside the point. Jason, you invited Bandrilla again this year. You invite her every year and every year she refuses. I know, dear, but as I told Katrina, we invite everyone. No one is left out. His majesty King Jason. Queen Catherine and Princess Katrina. My, how she's grown over the years. It's hard to believe she's 10 years old. Welcome, everyone. I am honored that you all have taken the time to come and celebrate with us. The celebration of Rhythm would not be the same without you. So, without further ado, let the celebration begin.

That sounds like fun. Hey. There's Tyler, the candlestick maker and his wife. They have a bunch of kids. Let's see if they can come and play. Excuse me, Mr. Tyler, sir. Um, we wanted to know if your children could play kickball with Bongee and me. Are they here today? They are around somewhere, Princess. I'll call them. Matthew. Benjamin. Zachary. Michael. Wesley. Lenny. Jody. Reno. Hi, Katrina. Hi, Bongee. What are you doing? It's okay. We're just having fun, sir. Come on, guys. Let's go play kickball. What would the King and Queen say if they saw that? He would say the princess was lucky to have such good friends. Your majesty. I'm so sorry. I... It's okay, Tyler. They're just kids having fun. I just wanted to commend you on the fine candles you made for the castle last week. I have never seen such artistic work on a candle. I hate to burn them. They look so beautiful. Thank you, Sire. King Jason, Queen Catherine, have some of my pastries. I make just for you. Please enjoy it. Mm-uah! Delicious, huh? Mm. Fabulous, Gary. Thank you and congratulations your Highness. It looks like another successful celebration. Look at all of the people. There seems to be more than last year. This is good. Ooh, look at all these people. I got it, don't worry. People of Kingdom Rhythm. Oh, they ain't listening to you, Barnabas. Ah, this ain't good. You know how she can be if people don't pay attention when she arrives. Ivan, be careful. She'll hear ya. No, she can't hear me, but she'll be here any moment and if you don't introduce her, we will pay. You know, she likes to make a big entrance. Must be her ego. People of the Kingdom of Rhythm. Her majesty, the queen of darkness, her royal evilness, the big kahuna. Bandrilla. Ivan, Ivan, Ivan. I think you have learned something after all these years. What's to learn? Bandrilla. I am so glad you decided to attend this year. On behalf of the people of the Kingdom of Rhythm, I welcome you. Bandrilla, you must try some of these pastries. They are delicious. Thank you. These are good. I could cook them better. I'm glad you like them. Your Majesty, we need you over at the pie table to judge the pies. Please come along. Yes, of course. Please, excuse me, Bandrilla. It's one of my duties, you know. Enjoy yourself. I'll talk to you later. Follow me. Aw, she looks so lonely. I think I'll go over and ask her to play with us. That would be nice. Are you crazy? She'll probably turn you into a purple toad. Or maybe an ogre. Or she might zap you like she did her two birdies and then you'll become a zombie. Well, she might. Look, all I'm gonna do is ask her to play kickball with us. It's no big deal. Bongee, you stay here and protect the scaredy cats. I'll be right back. What do you want? Um, would you like to play kickball with me and my friends? Why thank you child, but I think it's best if I just watch. I'm Bandrilla and who might you be? I'm Katrina. - The princess? - Yes. Oh, I should have guessed you were Jason's daughter. Run along, child. Your friends are waiting and... Thank you. Okay but if you change your mind, we'll be right over there. Uh huh, slip and slide. Slip and slide. Look out. Here we go. Oh, check out the moves. Hey, watch me go. Ivan, check out this one. Woo woo. Huh huh huh. What are you doing? - Uh... - Well. Boogieing. The electric slide. My tail. Sorry, your evilness. Hey, you're really smoking. It's time for the final dance. What's the final dance, Papa? It's when everyone makes a giant circle and the Royal family is in the middle. Then they each choose someone to dance with for a few minutes. And then they pick someone else to dance with. It's the highest honor to be the first to be chosen. Maybe the princess will pick me. Don't be silly. She always picks Bongee Bear first every year. Oh. May I have this dance? Thank you, my queen. Of course. Bandrilla. May I have the honor of starting the dance with you? Wait 'til they find out she can't dance. Ivan, please. She's gonna hear ya. Why do you say that? I think she heard ya. I think you're right. I can do this. All I have to do is fake it for a minute, then it will all be over. King Jason has been so kind to me. I will not insult him by refusing his request just because I can't dance. How hard can it be? As you wish. I am honored. Oh, this is not good. Not good at all. Ignore them. You are doing just fine. How dare you laugh at me? I'm Bandrilla, the queen of darkness. I told you so. I'm scared. And now. And now. And now. From this day forth the people of the Kingdom of Rhythm shall never dance again. We'll never dance again. This is nonsense. No wrinkled, old bag of bones can stop me from twinkling my toes. Surely if anyone can dance, it will be Gary the baker. He's the best dancer in the kingdom. Oh, no. The witch's spell really worked. All is lost. It'll be all right, Katrina. But Bongee, you don't understand. Neither I or anyone else will ever be able to dance again because of Bandrilla's spell.

There must be a way. Do you really think so, Bongee? The witch is so powerful. If anyone can help us, Mindy the owl of the Land of Wonder can. She is very wise and I am sure she can help us. I'll leave at once to see her. Now, you go into the castle with your parents. I'm sure they'll be wondering where you are. Bongee. Be careful, okay? I love you. Okay. Run along now. Well, there you go. Bandrilla was right again. She said someone would try to break her spell. Bandrilla was right? Of course, she was right. She's always right. - Hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, look at that. Okay, stop. Why do you think she wanted us to stay behind and listen bird brain? Come on, we gotta go tell her royal wickedness what this Bongee character is up to. I think I missed the last book. Oh, I'm right behind you, Barnabas. I must find a way to break Bandrilla's spell. Princess Katrina is counting on me. Is anyone there? Something's not quite right here. I don't hear anything. Not even the crickets. Hello? Who's there? I know you're out there. You come on out. Woo, hoo. Hey, Bongee. How you doing? It's moi. I've been following you. - What's up? - Myron. Gee, what are you trying to do? Scare me to death. Some friend you are. Have you been following me for awhile? Sure. I have. Ever since you left the Kingdom of Rhythm. I love to go and watch the people dance at the celebration every year. Dance is in my blood. It's in my feathers truly. ♪ Ah ra ta ta ta ta ta ♪ ♪ Ba dun ♪ ♪ Ba dun ♪ ♪ Ba dun bum bum ♪ ♪ What, shoo ♪ ♪ What, shoo ♪ Ooh, I hurt myself. I was even there when that crazy old witch zapped everyone. Oh, I'll never forget it. Zap, zap, zap. But how can that be? You're still dancing. Hello? Yoo-hoo. Hello? Is anybody in there? If you remember Bandrilla said none of the people would ever dance again. People. I mean, that's what she said when she did that zapping people, Bongee. I'm not a people. And hey, neither are you. Get it? Hello? Hello operator, I've been disconnected. Boy, I never even tried to dance after the spell. I was so concerned about Princess Katrina, but I still have to go see Mindy the owl to find a way to help King Jason and his people. Sure. Sure together we'll break her spell. I'll knock her and her two henchmen flat with one punch. Ka pow. Poom. Pow. That's three, but I don't care. Oh, I... I give her a karate chop. Ow. Oh, that it hurt. It's small pain. Lots of pain. Oh. Hello. Pilot to tower. Pi... mayday. Mayday. I'm hit. My wing is hit. Losing feathers fast. Hello? Help. Come in. I... I'm out of control. Oh, they going. Look at that. Three feathers at once. - If I sneeze. - I'm... hey. One, two, three. Oh, I'd have to have these reinserted. Oh. Where am I? Hi, 'member me? Wow, Myron. Are you all right? Oh, yeah. I'm okay. Aye, aye, aye. Ooh. Ah. It only hurts when I do this. You know what? I'm not gonna do that. Aye yi yi. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Just give me, you know, couple of weeks and I'll be fine. - Myron. - Ah, please. They don't stand a chance, but we have to hurry. Don't forget. Tonight at midnight we have to be at the festival of Mijon in Wonder Hollow. This'll be our first time celebrating it, Bong. Ooh, I can't wait. That's right. I almost forgot. I may not be able to be there. I made a promise to the princess. Oh, but Bong, if you don't go to the festival of Mijon, you'll lose your ability to talk and dance. I mean, it only happens once every 100 years. You gotta. I mean, you gotta be there. Then we have to hurry, don't we? Come on, Bongee, I know a shortcut to Mindy's home. Follow me. Walk this way. You know something? I think we're almost there. Bongee, Myron, welcome. That is amazing. She called us by... I mean, how did she know that it was? That's very impressive. I'm impressed. How'd she do that? Hello, Mindy. I've come because I need your help with a problem. The witch cast a spell on the people of the Kingdom of Rhythm. They can no longer dance. They laughed at her when she tried to dance with the King and she became angry. We really need your help and advice. Oh. Uh, Mindy? Would the two of you like some tea? Now you're talking. - What kind you got? - I'll be right back. What did you say that for? Gee, I'm sorry. I'm kind of thirsty. You know. Mindy, we don't... Drink. Oh. Wow. That really hit the spot. I'm damp. I'm damp all over. Mindy, we really need to hurry. Bongee, it was cruel of the people of the kingdom to laugh and make fun of Bandrilla. And it was also wrong for Bandrilla to put a spell on them. One bad deed does not deserve another. When will they ever learn? But all is not lost. Go to King Jason and tell him to send a messenger to Bandrilla apologizing for his people. What if she doesn't accept the apology? That is the best place to start, Bongee. Start there and see what happens. There are other things they can do, but apologize first. Go now. Thank you, Mindy. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, ow. Do you think apologizing will get Bandrilla to reverse the spell? Oh, oh, oh. I don't think so. Not in a month of Sunday. Not in any fairytale ever. It's me, Your majesty, Bongee. I have news. Come in, Bongee. Sire, Mindy the Owl says you should send a messenger to apologize to Bandrilla and that she will probably remove the spell. You're too late, my friend. While you were gone, I sent a messenger to do just that and moments before you arrived, he returned dancing. That's great, Your Highness. Then why do you look so sad? And why is Princess Katrina crying? Because Bandrilla turned him into a frog and sent back an answer saying she will never forgive us and that this dancing frog will always remind us of what we have lost. Then I shall return to the Magic Forest. Mindy the Owl said there were other things we could do if apologizing didn't work. I will not give up. And neither will I, Your majesty Highness, sir. Come on Myron. There's no time to waste. I'll be right with you, Bong. Give me a one, two. Oh, Bongee. Ooh, that was not so nice. Foot odor. Phew phew phew. Ay what, whoa. Oh. No, good, good. Ooh, ooh. Ay yi yi. Whoa. Hello, hello. I'm stuck. My head is stuck. I'll be out in a minute. What is this? Hold on please. Gee whiz. Whoa. I'll clean this up later. Um, I'll come back and take old care of, you know. Your majesty, your Holiness and your. Your kingly, sir. Look at her. She's really full of herself. Shh, don't let her hear you. You see what she does to Barnabas and Ivan. Tell me about it. I used to be much taller. Oh, no. Is she gonna sing again? Oh, it really hurts my ears. You don't even have ears. You're really getting to be a pain in the neck. I hate to tell you. You don't even have a neck either. I'm so misunderstood. Ooh. You think I was a common hood. They laughed when I tried to dance and now they want another chance. They wanna dance again but I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite the thriller. I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite the thriller. Evil grows from my head to my toes. Evil grows from her head to her toes. Sure they think my spell can be broken. Do they think it was dribble I had spoken, huh? My spells are so strong, how could I belong? They'll never dance again. I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite a thriller. I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite a thriller. Evil grows from my head to my toes. Evil grows from her head to her toes. With the help of my magic cauldron, I'll keep an eye on all of them. And if they should try to defy me, more evil is what they will see. They'll regret it 'til the end because I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite a thriller. I'm Bandrilla. I'm really quite a thriller. Evil grows from my head to my toes. Evil grows from her head to her toes. Evil grows from her head to her toes. Never will they dance again. Never will they dance. Ouch. Keep it up, smart guy, and I'll use you as a bowling ball. Let's see what they're up to now. You see that, Ivan? That's beautiful. That's why Bandrilla is where she is today. Fear, loathe, hate. If we work hard, someday my friend, we may reach that level too. You know, I'm glad you brought that up. Do you know what really sets her apart from all the rest? It's image. Now, I've written a song to boast our evil image. It will sky rocket us to the top of evildom. What are you talking about now? All right, just work with me, will ya?

When will they realize there's no way to break my spells? I'll have to keep an eye on that nosy bear and his friend to see what they're up. Ivan, Barnabas, go. Follow them into the Magic Forest and let me know everything they do. Oh gee, your wickedness. It's awfully late. Can't we go in the morning? I said go. Got ya. You never know when to shut up, do ya? You always get us in trouble with that beak of yours. You know you can't say things like that to her. Well, I'm tired. You know, she really should do something about that temper of hers. Counseling would do her good. Hey Bong, what do you think we have to do to break the spell now, huh? I'm not sure, but Mindy will have a plan. Who goes there? Do you hear that? It's just us again. What's the matter? You losing your touch. Coo, coo. Not you. Up there. Someone is watching us. I'll get the little snoop. Never mind, Myron. We don't have time to bother with them. Aw but gee. I could've caught 'em, Bong. Honest. He's right, Myron. Time is running out. The only way that you can defeat Bandrilla now is by having the animals of Wonder Hollow celebrate the festival of Mijon in the castle courtyard with all the villagers present. Its power would be much stronger than any spell that Bandrilla could make. But you must start this before midnight tonight, or all hope will be lost for 100 years. Oh no. It's 11 o'clock, Myron. There's no time to waste. You go to the Willow Grove and ask the other animals if they will have the festival in the castle courtyard. And I'll go tell the King to gather his people for the festival. Bong, you can count on me. I'm on my way. Thank you, Mindy. Take care and I will see you at the courtyard. You two finally did something right. By not getting caught by that phony bird and flying right back here quickly, I know their plan word for word and I don't have to guess what they said because you two idiots forgot. Well, when you're right, you are right, Witchy. Oh. Whoa, looks like you're slowing down in your old age. Ha, Witchy. Oh, not that time. Hi, Mindy. I have to move. Time real short. So, it seems they may have come up with a way to break my spell, but I'll bet the animals of the forest will only help if that pesky bear is there. So, I'll get rid Bongee Bear. Come on, you two. We have one last job to do tonight. Yes, your evilness. We are right behind you. You bet ya, babe. Your Highness, Bongee Bear is here to see you. Let him in please. Any news, my friend? We need to get all the villagers in the courtyard right away to celebrate the festival of Mijon with the animals of the Magic Forest. It's our only hope. I want you to send 50 guards to go out and bring all the people in the kingdom back to the courtyard immediately. Yes, sire. I'll go in the courtyard and ring the tower bell to alert everyone that something is up. Good idea. Go ahead. I'll wake Katrina. Hello, it looks like you're the first to arrive. The first? Isn't that just dandy. Bandrilla. You. You, you nosy, meddlesome bear. I've had enough of your interference. And where do you think you're going, pal? Yeah, where? Your time has come. Bongee Bear, I'm through with you. Oh, I've won. I've won. Now dance will be lost in the kingdom forever. Hey Bong, we're here and we made it on time. Wait. Yo. Hey Bong, where are ya? Bong. I mean. Where are you? I can't. Bong. Yo, Bong. Gee, I wonder where he is? I mean he said he'd be here. Hey, maybe he's over there. I mean, you know, with all those people. Hey, come on, Bongee. We don't have time to joke around like this. I mean. Oh. He ain't moving. Talk to me. It was the witch. We saw her do it. I... I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. Come on, get up, Bongee. You have to get up for the little princess. You gotta. Oh, Bong. It's just he's my best friend. What's going on here? I'm sorry, Your Highness. He's gone. Bongee. Bongee, no. That's me now and forever. That's me always together. That's me. Bongee. Bongee. My stars. What's happening? The power of love, Your Highness. If you remember, we gave Princess Katrina the gift of the waters from Love Brook when she was born. Her tears contained the love within her, and the witch's spell was no match for the love she had for her friend. Ugh. Oh. Wow. What are you all standing around for? It's only one minute until midnight. We must start the festival of Mijon now. Let's do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's party. Let those feathers fly. Ah, it's good to see everyone smiling again. How can we ever repay you? Thank you, Bongee. Bongee. You have saved the entire kingdom. We are forever indebted to you and the animals of Wonder Hollow. Hey, I mean, your Kingship. What about me? I wanted to thank you too, Myron. I have something special for you, but I don't have my sword right now. Excuse me. Here. Use this. On behalf of all the people of the Kingdom of Rhythm, I King Jason hereby dub thee Myron, grand protector of the Kingdom of Rhythm. I'll definitely have that fixed for you. Yeah, that might be good. I also need to thank you, Mindy, and all the animals of Wonder Hollow. Without you, my people would be doomed to a life without happiness and dance. I can't thank you enough. We were glad to help. I'm sure you would have done the same for us. How can this be? It's simple, your majesty. Bandrilla must've been hiding behind the tree or in the bushes during the entire celebration and the same power which gave us all the ability to dance also gave it to her.
