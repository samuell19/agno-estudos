Studio for Cinematography - Bucharest Presents A Production Our Director Screenplay by Performed by: Emeritus Artist of the R.P.R. (Romanian Popular Republic) Laureate of the State Prize Assistant Director Assistant Cameraman Production Leader Editor Set Design Sound Costumes Make-up Music composed by Performed by the Symphonic Orchestra for Cinematography Conductor Cinematography Production Manager Adapted for the Screen and Directed by D. R. G. B. P. What kind of institution could this be? Information office Entry for personnel It is a peaceful institution where life unfolds gently, without disturbances. Over here, everyone knows what they have to do. Everything is foreseen and resolved. The Director comes at the office at the exact hour. The registration office receives piles of mail on a daily basis. The secretaries distribute it to those in charge They examine the issues, they compile reports and arrange assessments. It's the end of a quarter Labor analysis meetings are regularly held in the management boardroom. All the chief service officers meet there, along with the president of the Syndicate, the secretary of the primary organization and of course... the Director that presides over the meeting and gives the word, in turn, to everyone. Every single one stands up and reports. In our department it was like so and like this... and we achieved the target at 100% Then another one gets up and... The target was achieved at 100%, and even a bit more! Then another.. and another. Until they all finish reporting. The president of the Syndicate then makes a statement about their position in the socialist competitions. From which results that in the quarter that has just passed, the number of workers that have been involved in the competitions has increased by a few percent. In the end, the Director thanks everybody And congratulates those that have a few percent over the target of 100 He scolds the others because they only manage to achieve the feat of reaching the 100% target exactly. Then he asks those present to make the proposals for the awards in the shortest time possible. The date is determined for the prize giving ceremony, with all of the workers, where the bonuses will be handed out. And the meeting is wrapped up as its agenda has been successfully covered. Excuse me, sir! Be careful with those. You're shoving your weeds in my face. Where do you see weeds? These are lettuce seedlings. Pardon me. - Make way, please! - I can't - I'm suspended here. Like a boat on the waves, I just go with the flow! George! - Costica! - What a coincidence! Isn't it so? We haven't seen each other in years. - Since we were working together. - Those were the times. Still working there? - No, I changed my job. - Where? I've been working for almost a year at D. R. T. B. I mean D. R. G. B. J. .. Anyway, it's called D. R. G. ... - Et cetera - D. R. G. ? P. B. ! What is it? It's D. R. G. B. P. ! - Dammit! - What is it? I missed my station, I'm gonna be late again. Goodbye, goodbye. Wait a minute. When can we meet? Come have dinner with us on Sunday, we'll talk. - Do you still live there? - Yeah. - After the barrier? My in-law's house! Everyone clocked in? Long ago? Had to go to the market to buy these lettuce seedlings. - Then I met Costica. - Is it so? So it is. Like this and like that and so on. - I'm not signing this. - What? Why? - But sir, tomorrow is the last day... - I am not signing this. I personally double-checked all the facts. I said that I am not signing it and that's that. - Any further discussion is futile. - We're in a competition, comrade Director. - Take it from here! - But Sir... I said get rid of it. You didn't double-check. Take it! We are a cultured institution, comrade. Cultured! What will they say at the Ministry when they receive a paper with my signature where tarred cardboard is mistyped as tarred calfboard! I'm going to rectify immediately Take it and go. I'm done with you for today. Sit down. What do you want? - I told you, just a stamp. - It's too late. It's not too late. If you stamp it now, I have enough time to get to the Supply Office - to settle the rest of the formalities. - You don't, today we eat earlier. There's the festive gathering. With the bonuses! The award ceremony is held in the dining room. The patrons have barely finished eating as the girls start clearing the tables in a hurry. Some of them leave, others stay. - Where are you going? - Going home, to plant this lettuce. I bought these seedlings this morning and they're gonna dry up. But the award ceremony is coming up. So? There's no way they'll give me a prize. I'm glad that people don't give me any attention and mind about my business. I'm not chasing prizes. Wait a bit, it's your office's turn this quarter along with the Library and the Planification and Registration offices. You gotta be there, or you'll get your envelope misplaced. Stop luring me, my seedlings will spoil. I used all my remaining money to pay for them. To hell with those seedlings, splash some water on them. You'll buy new ones tomorrow. Trust me. I know how it goes around here. To be frank, I minded my own business and was never a nuisance to anyone. Why wouldn't I deserve a prize as well? A few tables are placed side by side in the back, on a platform. They are covered with a red cloth. A couple of flower pots are placed on them. A bottle of sparkling water and a few glasses. Then the chairs and.. That's about it. Comrades, We have gathered today according to our well-established custom in the tradition... - What if I receive, let's say.. 100 LEI I'll buy some more seedlings I'll get a pair of sandals for my eldest son and a kerchief for my wife. But what if I receive, let's say.. 200 LEI? With 200 LEI I can buy seedlings sandals for both of my boys and even a dress fabric for the wife. I'll even have some money left. ...our institution whose efforts have represented a distinguished contribution. Chief of Service, comrade Anton Constantinescu. For well-managing and organizing our library. Comrade Gheorghe Treandafir Chief Librarian. For showing spectacular orderliness while being in charge of the library. What did I tell you? The library. Comrade Enache Stanoi Chief of the Planification Office. For bringing to fruition all of the project's tasks. The Planification! You're one crafty fellow, Ionescu. - How do you know all this? - I've been here for 3 years. I know. Comrade Specialist Vasile Dobrescu, from the Planification Service. For his worthy contribution. Ilie Nicolau, Specialist. For the way he took ownership of his work, even though he's new in the field and a recent graduate. Gheorghe Ciubuc - Ciubuc! - Technical Specialist. For making sure everything is up to date and punctuality at the workplace. Elena Fabian Typist. For her outstanding contribution at the end of the closure of this quarter. What did he say about me, Ionescu? What was the prize for? He said something about "up to date" and "punctuality". If there are 25 LEI bills in here I think I hit the jackpot. There must be at least 300 LEI in this envelope. But what if there are 100 LEI bills? If that's the case, I'm not coming into work for a week. I'll get a medical leave and I'll go to my auntie at the countryside to buy a pig. 47 LEI and 43 cents. Why these 43 cents? The change is not even enough for a bus fare. It was not worth toiling that much for 47 LEI and 43 cents. What can I do with the money? Whether in large or small sums, money needs to be responsibly spent. Tanase Florescu, Leader of the Printing Office Which has ensured the correct duplication of all directives and instructions on time & in great condition. Tanase Florescu Is Tanase Florescu not present? Someone take his envelope. He is. Comrades, the administration is awarding me now, at the end of the quarter. I don't need a prize. Please take it back. - Well, you know, here... - I know. That's the custom over here. Waiting in line, like at the mill. Everyone waits to get a small piece of the award fund. But I'm fed up with this rule. I stand here before you, comrades. And I ask myself: What have I done to deserve this prize? - I also wonder about the others. - Bravo! You tell em', comrade! Please don't disturb the order of the gathering. Comrade Florescu, you're discouraging the people by discrediting such an important workforce stimulating measure like our award process. I'm listening. I wanna say that you have played an important role in fulfilling our institution's plan. Yourself, along with all of the workers in the Printing Office have ensured the duplication on time, and in proper conditions of all Administration directives and instructions. Because of you all other departments have reached their target by sending all directives on the field. Curse those directives! That's why I should get a prize? You know what the people on the field are saying? Let me tell you. - There's no need. At another time. - This is a festive gathering. So what if it's a festive gathering? - Let the man say what he has to say. - Tell it, old man! Let old Tanase speak! - Old Tanase - Let's hear him Look Just a few days ago someone from Iasi or Bacau arrived by accident in our office. He came to Bucharest & got lost in the building. He needed to settle something with the Forecasting or Supply Office. I can't remember. He gazed at our highly productive machines. How they swallow the blank paper on 1 side and bring it printed on the other. The man kept looking and wondering. "What are you doing here?" He asked. "Don't you see?" I responded. We're printing directives with these machines. I understand. - You must have a lot of work. - We sure do. We must print 4 others until noon, not including the one in here. The comrade got closer to the machines and started examining them. "These machines...", he asked me after gazing for a few moments "they never break?" How could they break? We take care of them. And what do you do when there's a power outage? Our factory runs like clockwork. The power never goes out. What a shame. "What?" I respond while being dumbstruck. "What a shame" he says once more. If the power went out we could finally start our work. I don't get what you're insinuating. And I approach him while hinting for 2 comrades to block the door so he can't escape. "You pretend you don't get it" he says Any idea how many instructions and directives you've printed with these machines just last month? It's documented in our registry book. We printed everything we were asked to. Always on time - no delays - Even worked night shifts when we had to. - Just last month we received 72 of them. 650 pages in total from the headquarters! When can we read, process and send all of them to the districts? - Is it clear now? - What can I say.. - I got the gist of it. - Then show me where I can find the Planification Office They'll tell me how to get to "Supplies" afterwards. I showed him and he went there. And we stood there dumbfounded staring at our machines that seemed to print even harder now and were pouring out the prints in heap after heap. You want to give me a prize for this? - I'd rather not. - Bravo! Bravo! You couldn't have said it better, comrade Florescu! It's true! Silence, please. If comrade Florescu considers that he doesn't deserve a prize it means that who nominated him made a mistake. Maybe he can tell us a method of guiding the people on the field without directives & instructions. We'd like to know it. But why are the people saying that then? Maybe not that many are needed. Let's not take any ignorant's word for it. The main office will analyse this case and take action if it's necessary. Let's continue. Next up is comrade Marin Gheorghe, also from the Printing Office. Comrade Marin Gheorghe, while proving a remarkable zeal Don't bother, Mr. Director. How can I say this I share the same view as comrade Florescu But I couldn't say it as well as he did. I don't need the prize. That's all. Silence, please. Fine, we'll discuss this case as well. Next on the list is comrade Paraschiva Simion. Throughout the past quarter, comrade Paraschiva Simion has I didn't do anything of note! I only helped the management fill the provinces with papers. I refuse the prize. I gather this is an organised attack against the management. - In this case - There's no organised attack. I received a prize But listening to what Mr. Florescu said I realised that I didn't win it on merit. I'm giving it up. Gheorghe, get out of here while you can Otherwise, you'll have to give some explanations to your wife at home Stop screaming, comrade. This is not a circus! - Wait up. - What happened? Too much fuss. I'll get my envelope tomorrow from Accountancy. - This ceremony sure turned out memorable. - This Tanase Florescu ain't good. What will he do now? - The Director? - No, old Tanase. - Who knows - What nerve! To confront the big boss with such audacity. Moving on, you're liable to buy a round now. Get outta' here. I'm going home, I'm busy. - Just 1 drink can't hurt anyone. - It can. - No way. Maybe another time. I'm drained right now. White Lily Buffet What do you want? Please bring us What needs to be done? We need to make quick decision regarding the money. - Regarding what money? - The total prize money. The instructions state they can only be used until the 15th of next month. So do you propose that we give out the prize money? - Indeed, ye.. - How you gone mad? - Those weren't enough prizes for him - It's a shame to lose them. You didn't learn anything from what happened earlier. The situation is really serious, comrades. People have started to take a stand. We need to analyse the matters and go for a serious self-evaluation. That's true. The only solution is self-criticism. A severe, ruthless self-evaluation. Let's not get ahead of ourselves with this. Sure, we should analyze the matters But let's not move this quickly to self-criticism. This was an organized attack meant to undermine the management. We need to find its root. Be vigilant. Comrade Director, I think this time... I gather everyone is rooting for self-criticism then. Absolutely. Only self-criticism can get us out of this trouble. Are you also rooting for self-criticism? No, no, you. Yes.. naturally.. me too How could I not root for self.. creat icism. But it'd be a shame to lose the prize money To hell with the money. As if that's important now. So then it's self-criticism from left to right. Fine. - We'll have to conduct a report. - You have to conduct it yourself In front of the Syndicate's General Assembly. It can't be done like this, my friend To just come with these issues out of the blue in front of the General Assembly. It's sufficient if the management analyses the matter and takes a self-critical approach in accord with the institution's liability guidelines. It.. will be known. It used to be different back then. I've been wanting to ask you this for some time. Where do you plant this lettuce? Next to my house. - You're well off then. - Not complaining My mother-in-law left us a nice, spacious house with a patch of land at the outskirts of Bucharest. What an in-law! But it was completely empty inside Not even a chair to sit on. On the only nail stuck on the Eastern wall, where the sun rises and where she told us to make the bedroom she hung the icon of Saint Paraskeva. Take care of this house and my daughter, listen to Saint Paraskeva's teachings and everything will work out well. When you finish, come downstairs. I'll take you home with the car. - Goodbye - Farewell, comrade Please call the Chief Secretary to my office. I will have to compile a self-evaluation in a report regarding what happened today at the gathering. I'd like to ask you. To compile a quick bulletin. A short list with bullet points, as usual. On a larger scale. But make it quick. - Tomorrow by noon is good? - Very good. Tomorrow afternoon you will have it ready. I wanted to ask you Who the hell was that lousy girl? I keep thinking about her screaming Bravo! Bravo! Goddamn lass! If she hadn't stepped in Tanase Florescu wouldn't have anyone on his side. I also wonder who she is, but I can't remember where she was assigned. - I don't know where she's from either. - We need to stop this habit Of hiring people in the institution who are not known by the Chief of Staff, nor the President of the Syndicate nor the Director. When the hell can you read them all? So many brochures too. Various problems you need to keep up-to-date with. And besides all of that Coming from the Ministry & Commissions.. orders, instructions countless directives. How could you go through all of them? In some way, Tanase was right It's not easy to lead an institution in these times You're looking for me. Yes. I mean no. A shame. A shame? What kind of shame? You will pay the price for this mockery. We will see who who will pay the real price in the end. What are you alluding to? The former workers pulled out of the field who got infected with this bureaucracy. You're insulting the working class? You're insulting the working class by your everyday behavior. You make a big thing out of starting from the ground-up as worker in a factory but you forgot that you were never actually a real worker. You were a storeman and then a clerk. Listen here. Who are you anyway? I am a vision of your troubled & nervous conscience. You don't think of your reponsibilities. Only about the advantages that the situation will ensure for you. You've aristocratized And become a dangerous arrogant. I will remove the pillows under you one-by-one from the comfortable lair you laid out for yourself. You'll run in to me night and day. Yes, yes I need to make a change at work And concerning my attitudes towards the others. In my personal life too. I won't spray cologne on my chest anymore. I won't send the cleaning lady to buy groceries in the institution's car anymore. And I won't let my wife drive it either. That's it. Trifles. You only think of trivialities. You are not able to see the big picture. It can't be swept under the rug You need a bigger broom You must bring it on yourself first. So you can finally wake up. Enough. Enough. That's enough. Enough.. What are you doing? - I came to sweep. - Sweep who? Sweep what? In the living room. Couldn't find another time to bring the broom?! I'll tell you what happened last night. I mean, someone told me this. Anyway, do you believe in dreams? - You must be joking, Sir, I'm awake. - You're right. I will tell you something totally peculiar. - You see, last night - After the prize meeting - Did you find anything out? - No, you were saying that.. You're right. I'm out of my element today. Please excuse me. I'm really busy. I want to be left alone. No one is to disturb me. Who should I consult with? Advices? Why would I need advices? The only solution is to hasten making a change at work. Where to start? TO BE COMPLETED COMPLETED I can't start with paperwork when making this change. I have to undertake a new task Something special. The key to this change relates to the masses. That's it. That's what that girl was saying too. This dream will drive me nuts. Forgive me, your assistant told me you are busy - I want to tell you that I found that girl - What girl? The one screaming at the ceremony yesterday. You think I have time for this right now? See what's with her. That is your job. I'm going for a stroll around the offices. Where should I go first? I'll go to the Inspection Office This way I'll make a connection in one go with both the people working in the office and on the field. On what floor is the Inspection Office? There are no signs. These bureaucrats don't think of anything. Are you looking for someone, comrade Director? Should I ask her where I can find the Inspection Office? Who knows what can come out of this too. Inspection Office Good day, comrades. They're startled as if they saw the devil in flesh - Good day, comrade Director. - Welcome to our office After finishing your reports, we will hold a meeting with each Sector's management and examine the situation on the field. Good day. Statistical Office Good day, comrades. - Good day. - Welcome, comrade Director. Please don't pause your work. I just came by to say hello. How is your mother doing? Has she recovered? Didn't you once come to me in regards to some medicine for your mother? Why would she need medicine? She died a long time ago. I was the one with the firewood request. My receipts were misplaced at the Administrative Office. Now I remember. I remember very well. So? - The firewood was sorted out? - It was... winter passed anyway. This is a quite bad start for re-connecting with the masses. Comrade Director, I'd like to show you something. You see, I compared our forms. They only differentiate by a column. We could summarize into a single one. Great then. Very interesting. But I don't have the time now I'll call you to explain it to me at length. I'll leave you to your tasks. Easy shift. Comrade Director. I'm in a delicate situation. - What is this? - The prize. You know.. in our office all of my colleagues returned it. - I can't ke.. - Bring it to the pay-office then! Am I your delivery man? You've all lost your mind. That's enough for today. I better finish my paperwork. - Your personal driver - What happened? My brother wrote He's got fattened geese. If you permit it, I'd stop by his place in the afternoon. It's not far. Better price straight from the manufacturer. I don't need geese right now. You know I thought of your lady.. the groceries.. The car is the State's property. For work, not for geese. I want these abuses to stop. I don't want to hear that the institution's car is used for anything not work-related. - Understood? - Of course, I understand. But, you know.. A pit-stop at Tunari is not a big deal. In 1 hour, one and half tops, I would be back. Not anymore, comrade. Not anymore! If you say so. But it's a pity for the geese They're fattened. I don't need geese. I need order in the institution. That's that. Then please forgive me. I'm going to school. What school? What for? It's almost one o'clock. I have to pick-up little Misu. Doesn't he have feet to walk home on them like all the others? He's feeble, comrade Director Not accustomed to walking. He might get lost, sweat or, God forbid, get hit by a car. Give me break with these stories! You're spoiling him. He's become so cosy that everything has to be perfect for him. Do you think my dad drove me to school everyday? I used to walk barefoot in the summer & with torn boots in the winter. And nothing happened. You will do as I say. It's over with picking and dropping off Misu. - Understood? - Understood. Wait. Go today and pick him up from the school. That brat might wait for you for God-knows how much. - And starting tomorrow - Tomorrow? Bring him to school, but not at the entrance gate Leave him 100 metres behind. And when you pick him up wait for him over there. It's better this way. I don't know what's happening today I feel everyone is pulling my leg Why are you so sulky, Mr. Georje? I came for advice. What happened? Are your sails out of wind? Or have your seedlings dried out? Can't say about the sails, but the seedlings are well. I did as you told me & they're fine I checked this morning. - I'll plant them as soon as I get home. - Then what? Another problem What kind of life could this be, if you're always living with fear in you? Waiting all-day, not knowing when a boss might come to you. And the biggest of bosses too! Who knows what he will devise tomorrow. Might go amuck through the offices again. If he's firmly determined to look everywhere Goodbye peace and quiet! What's bothering you if the Director comes through the offices? That's his duty. A Director needs to know everything. He can look anywhere. That's why he's a Director. I'm a delicate being. I can't bear bosses coming into my office at any time. I get a lump in my throat. Who knows what they won't like and start questioning about it. This is not a life to live. Does it say anywhere that if he came once, he's going to come every single day? That's the biggest fear of them all. Always living with incertitudes. Take a few precautions like I did. - Is the report ready? - On time, like always, as you ordered. - You included suggestions too? - I did, in a special chapter at the end - Both technical & oganizational matters included. - Thank you. Let me study it. I'll call for you later on. God forbid! Those are all the registers you work with? How can you handle them? I only handle one. I display the ones from the last years to make an impression. You should do it too. - I can't - Why? They took mine to the archive as per proceedings. Only left me one. Then put up some folders, some papers old newspapers, anything, so they see that you're working. - Don't tell me you don't have papers. - God Almighty! I have so many of those I gathered so many in the last few months. that I don't even dare to register them. I stuffed them in the drawers when I found out he's coming. I barely found a concealed space. What do I do? Take them out from the drawers and put them up nicely on your desk. As many as possible, but make sure they're arranged. What if he asks if I'm up-to-date with the registers? Say that you are, what's the problem? They will stand out if there are so many. Let them be many! Say that you can't handle them all. Say that another functionary will help and you're all set. Our boss likes to see many functionaries. What can I say.. You have a knack for this I'll do as you said I went through a lot. Maybe I'll get away this time too. Sorry for disturbing, but I have an urgent matter. Go ahead. We're in hot water, comrade. Everybody's asking for a general assembly. I have to inform the offices. What's this rush to tell the offices? We agreed on the self-evaluation. We'll complete it. - You can inform them afterwards. - They need to know immediately We can't defer it. I'm going there. I was right from the very start For.. For For What's that? - The list with all institution employees. - What for? No idea, you told me to get it. Oh, yeah. Leave it here and please call for the Chief Secretary. I studied attentively the report It's well-documented, lively, interesting The tone is just and sincere But it's not up to par on a intellectual level. In such circumstances the problems can't be addressed only from a practical point of view. The theoretical side of things must also - be highlighted. - Comrade Director It can be done. You know that I always give my best in order to be useful for the institution - And for yourself. - Concentrate some more on it. It needs to contain some carefully selected quotes as well. Then something about the issue of connecting with the masses. More detailed and - more powerful. - Don't you worry. - I'll make it real powerful. - Good. Start working on it straight away. Don't come to the office until it's completely finished. And.. one more thing Yes, Sir. Pay some more attention to the style. In some passages, I don't even recognize my style. Like it's not even mine. - I will give my absolute best. - Then good luck and So Good lad. He's improved beautifully since working with me. I usually connect better with the people that I work close with. Come closer too. Are you stuck there? Closer, closer You see, all the nuisances stem from this. I'm detached from the simple folks. I need to reestablish the connection. I'll carry on differently Organized Every single day I'll bring 2 or 3 of them in for a face-to-face conversation. I get to know them, they get to know me too. This is much better than barging into offices. Who should I start with? One Two Three Two is enough. Have these two come to my office tomorrow morning At 09:30 & 10:00 respectively. On the hour. And call for my car now. Actually, know what What if I go home by bus? It's not that pleasant. I don't even remember the last time I took the bus. When you commute 2 or 3 times a day with a bunch of people you learn a lot of things. It's like listening to the breath of the masses! What? The masses. The breath of.. You're so savvy. All these people are crowding in the bus I better go back and take the car Better not They will think I've gone mad I'll walk on foot It's a bit far, but it's actually more pleasant on foot And you're practically walking alongside the masses A bit tiresome, but it's very pleasant The people have pretty faces I've lost the habit I have to add to my schedule 1 hour of walking each day In the start let's say each week. And now you're coming on foot What's with this strange behavior? Look how sweaty you are And what's your problem with poor Misu? And don't make me start about the geese. Those were phenomenal fattened geese. I've something on my mind, darling. - I have to tell you. - Say it. Stop sprinkling that high, you'll break the stems. That's what you want to tell me? No, dear. - Where I left off? - You said the Director's scouring. Yes, you're right. - I feel really guilty. - What's your deal with him? - With who? - With the Director. I'm talking about the prize, not about the Director. - What this prize you're talking about? - The prize I got at the festive gathering. What feat did you achieve to get a prize? I take it you're not in middle school anymore. I got it at work for my service, my punctuality & who knows what else. 47 LEI and 43 cents That's something. And where's the money? The money? Money, money, they came and went. - With Ionescu, after a few glasses. - Good job, prizewinner! He caught me by surprise. - And he's coming to dinner on Sunday. - Ionescu? - No, no - The Director? - Heaven forbid! - Then who? - Mr. Costica, I already told you Not even the devil is as black as he's painted. Who knows But what came over the Director to visit your office? He didn't come yet, dear. Does it say anywhere that he needs to come? If he set his mind on it, he will. What's bothering you if the Director comes through the offices? That's his duty. A Director needs to know everything. He can look anywhere. That's why he's a Director. Not saying it's bothering me. But it's vexing me. The register! Comrade Ciubuc, the Director's assistant has called asking for you. You need to go to the Director's office at 09:30 sharp. How? For..what? That's all she said - 09:30 exactly 08:30 An hour to go An entire hour on pins and needles I can't even start working now What to do? Ionescu is my only hope Ionescu, I swear to God If Saint Paraskeva showed up last night and told me this: Thy faithful believer, Gheorghe Be wary Stay away from sin, as the evil is waiting around the corner. and followed to tell me in great detail what was about to happen to me at the office as a God-fearing man as I am - maybe I still wouldn't have believed it. - Mr. Georje, summarize it I am summarizing it. So I would've even ventured to question the Saint's own words. And I am not a man to dare question a Saint's advice Especially of Saint Paraskeva who is our home's protector. - Get to the point, man. - I am getting there. Saint Paraskeva didn't show up I didn't have any eye twitches, nor eyelash trembles - nor any other sign. - So what? The Director called me to his office at 09:30 today. Calm down, Mr. Georje Don't be so pessimistic. How can I calm down? I have to start looking for a job tomorrow. But did he really need to call me to his office for this matter? In a case like this someone from the Staff calls for you tells you rapidly some unpleasant things. And you go on your way. Sure, fire me if it's an order and it's needed. But why torture me like this? Pull yourself together. These big bosses just feel like talking to some smaller employees once in a while, to get some advice. Let's say, to feel the pulse of the masses. If that's not it, then I've failed my school of hard knocks exam. God forbid! To bother my inner peace and scare me stiff just for some advice? What do I know about his duties? He should know how to handle them. That's why he's a Director. - Just hope it's nothing bad. - It can't be bad. It can't b..? - Comrade Ciubuc. - Me. So you know how to upholster furniture too? - What? - Yeah. Your mother-in-law's second husband was an upholsterer. And wanted to teach you too. He did. It's good that you're handy. These Staff people find everything out I can't help you. You came too early. Would it be possible to enter earlier? Are you in a hurry? The sooner, the better. I think so. You think so too? Hello - Do you allow me to? - Yes Not possible, the Director is very busy. I can't transfer you. He's in a meeting. If it's really urgent leave your number. The Director will call you when he has the time. As you wish. Stop insisting, comrade I already told you. You didn't tell me anything. I'm somebody else. Then I'm telling you too: Come tomorrow! Well, I come from abroad - I'm leaving tonight and.. - You shouldn't have come uninvited. - There's no point waiting there. - I have a very important matter. Sure, the Director only has important matters too. - I can't disturb him. - But mine was postponed so many times. Go check with your Field's Office. - Then what do I do? - Leave the paper at the Registry Office From there it will be forwarded to the competent office which will, in turn, forward it to the Director, and he will resolve it. You'll receive an answer, if it's needed. Call back tomorrow morning. No, no Not possible. He's busy all day. No, he couldn't handle it yet. He was too busy. Poor girl How much hassle she has to go through in order to make them understand that the Director is really busy I will inform him. Ionescu couldn't be more wrong. How could anything good come out of this? The Director doesn't have time to talk on the phone Doesn't even have the time to talk to people from abroad But wants to talk to me? Must be something really bad He forgot of me today. Maybe he forgets tomorrow too. And the next day. And then completely. I should leave There's no escape now My time has come. Go in, comrade Ciubuc Who is there? Me with your approval. Ciubuc from Administration Gheorghe Come closer Don't stay stuck to the door. What do you want? Nothing, Heaven Forbid. What could I want? If you don't want anything, why are you here? You're right. I forgot I called for you. I have so much on my mind. Come closer. Come on, why are you this jittery? Good Sit down. Sit in the armchair. Sit back on it Get comfortable. Sit down properly. So? Is it good here? It's good, of course. Do you like it? I like it. Did you like it from the beginning? In the beginning I was a bit afraid, to be honest. And now? Now.. It's a bit better. This armchair.. Do you have any remarks? What do you mean by remarks? I mean if something's not right, the Director needs to know. that's why I called you. I want to know your opinion too. So the Director has called me to try these armchairs I understand now - With your approval, please let me. - Please do. Your choice But if you feel that something's not right, say it directly. From my personal experience it is as it should be. Maybe you have some remarks regarding the situation in the other offices. - My field doesn't allow me.. - What do you do? Now they call me: "Technical Specialist" But I'm still an archivist in the end. I take care of the Administration archive. In this case You must know the situation from the other offices which the Administration one is working with. Mostly about the Accountancy & Registry Offices. Regarding the Pay Desk, Supply & Planification Offices a little less. Ok then. And how is it there? How's the condition? It's... It's not bad. Not bad? Then is it good? I can't say it's too good either. Then say it frankly. How is it? Let me say it straight, no beating around the bush - It's creaking - Creaking? It's true. Does it creak a lot? Not that much. If you're not that sensitive, it's no big deal. Don't hold it back! Tell me honestly: What's the situation? - You see... - I don't want to see anything! If it's creaking, I need to know as a Director And you need to tell me, as an employee of the institution. - But I.. - I don't want to hear it It's not alright to hide it and falter. You need to help me. Don't hold back now. Talk openly & be honest. Where does it creak more? It creaks more in Accountancy. The boss there rocks back and forth all day. Just like this. - Is it so? - And everyone there follows him. It keeps creaking nonstop. Your ears start ringing before you manage to get a signature. It hurts my soul but I just can't hold back the truth. That's the right thing to do, comrade. I'm glad to see such loyal devotion for the institution in a seasoned functionary like yourself. And concerning the other offices you're familiar with How's it there? There's no comparison - it's not a problem - Honestly speaking? - Absolutely honest. - Hope you're not trying to hide anything. - This can't be hidden. If it starts creaking, it creaks no matter how much you cover it up. And it gets on your nerves, especially if you're sensitive. When it creaks, the screws need to be fastened - That's the only remedy. - You're right. We need to avoid any compromises with all shortcomings. We need to fasten those screws. That's the only remedy, like you just said. I like that you tell it like it is. Not like some others who tangle it up without making sense. Yes It's not possible. Ask for "Interior 37" You must wait if he called for you. And just so you know, comrade, you've provided some great help here by showing me where it creaks. Look what a simple discussion with a simple fellow can do Man-to-man I always sensed that something creaks there in Accountancy. I will do exactly as the lower classes request. I will fasten the Accountancy clerks' screws until they have bureaucracy coming out of their nose. People's ears start ringing before they manage to get a signature. We'll make a general assembly, if it can't be settled otherwise. I will, of course, admit my shortcomings. But I will show them that I know how to unmask the true bureaucrats that have nested themselves in the institution and do nothing but rock in their chairs all day. I'm on the right track for reconnecting with the masses. - Another opportunity to connect with the masses is waiting - Where? In the waiting room. You called for another person. - Comrade Maria Popescu - Oh yes, indeed! - She arrived? - For quite a while. She even said she can go back to work if you don't have time. I have all the time in the world for this. Bring her in. The Director is waiting for you. Enter, comrade, don't be shy. Why would I be? What are you doing here? - I was told you called for me. - Me? Oh, yes - So you're Maria Popescu - Sure am. I'm really glad that you called me here. - I am glad too. - I have so much to tell you. - Why didn't you come? I am always here. - Oh, I came But it's not that easy to get you. To me? No way! I am always open to talking with the folks in the institution. It's very important for me. Might be, but your secretary doesn't know it. What do you mean? She repeats the same phrases over & over, and sneers at everyone. "Comrade Director is busy." "He is very busy." "Come tomorrow!" - I was a bit busy lately. - I'm not talking about lately. It's always been like that And there many problems. Come in. You were right once again, Ionescu. Bosses are really strange. If they're stuck on an idea, they make time to talk to someone like me regarding the state of the chairs in the office. What if I even get a promotion. Of course it can be solved. - How would it work otherwise? - It could work another way. - You know it all. - I don't, but everyone is complaining. - So it's a general discontent then? - Not really "general" Some have come to terms with this situation. But I didn't. So it's a personal matter. Yes, I'm a textile worker by trade. I was pulled from production and sent to the 3-month school. You know what I do here? I write receipts in the canteen. - If I had stayed in the factory - Of course you would've become a top performer and would've earned much more. It's not about that. I'm content with less, but I want to do something useful. Keeping the canteen in order is not useful? It is, but there isn't a need for a skilled worker to do it. It will all work out fine if everyone does their job as they should. You don't even know what's going on here. - Me? - You. - It's said that - Yeah, "it's said" It's all gossip with you. We don't gossip. It hurts us. We went to the Base Organization Office to raise the problem. We want an assembly. So the simple, honest people in the institution can voice their opinion. I know what the simple, honest people in the institution are thinking. Now tell me why you came here - it's late I said what I wanted to say. How about you? You called me. There's no need, it's clear now. Please make me a large coffee and call the Chief of Staff. I haven't done paperwork since God knows when It's time to get down to business I thought about this We have some very valuable people here. At the canteen, for example, there is one girl - Maria Popescu Do you know her? Yes, the screaming girl from the ceremony. What's done is done. She's a capable, skilled textile worker that could surely become a top performer in her field. It's a shame to deprive the field of such a worker. Especially in the textile branch, where there is such need right now. I'd like you to ask. If they want her - the transfer is approved. - We just need to ask and it's done. Then go and ask but.. discreetly. Others might want to leave. I know how to handle it, no worries. There's one Technical Specialist in the Administration Office Ciubuc Gheorghe - Do you know him? - I do. Old-fashioned functionary, pretty limited. Limited? You're mistaken. He's a simple, modest man with a broad perspective. He looks at matters with seriousness and depth. I found out from him some interesting things. I'm surprised. How many times have I told you how shallow you views on people are? See if there's a way we can get him a promotion. Two actually. He deserves it. Ask about Tanase Florescu too. If he's past retirement age Not even the Minister has the right to do this. That's why the State's Inspectorate exists to inspect! But not to undermine my authority. The Minister should've called me and kept me up-to-date. It would've been totally different. - if I'd have known a commission is coming beforehand - Of course. I will request the Minister to meet me right now. There's no point. I should write a memorandum. Will you help me? Yes. We're in hot water, Mr. Georje. - It's really bad. - What curse got over you, Ionescu? - We're burning up. - I'll bring you some water. - I don't need water, we're on fire. - Fire is put out with water. Don't know how we're gonna put this one out. What fire can't be put out with water? You're in the mood for jokes Or do you think you'll have it easy? Why wouldn't I have it easy? You'll see when the commission asks for you. What commission? Haven't you heard that a commission has come? No, it's not like they came for me An investigating committee! - Investigating? Why did they come? - It's like you're living in another world. The news that something is creaking over here got to the Minister. What a strange way to fix the chairs. Instead of calling a carpenter, he calls an investigating committee. The Chief from Administration will have it rough. You think he's the only one? Those who rock on the chairs will get it. I have nothing to fear. It's like we're speaking 2 different languages. What kind of commission do you think it is? Like I said, after finding out from you - An Investigating Committee for the chairs - What chairs? The chairs that are creaking. At Accountancy for example. - Yours too, because you're rocking on it. - It's not about chairs It's about all of us, the whole institution. It's a commission from the State's Inspectorate. From the Workforce Department and God-knows-where. They're investigating everywhere. Going from office to office and questioning. Asking what? What don't they ask? They wanna know everything. What you're doing, not doing, how you're doing it why you're doing it like that and not the other way, They make you show them what you do when you do it And look everywhere to see if you were doing it the same before. And they want to know the purpose too. To know everything. And after asking all of that, they want to know your opinion. - About the investigation? - No, they'll deduce that. About everything in general: the institution, your work and so on. We're in deep water. That's how the Director asked me too And I got a promotion out of it. You think it's the same? Go eavesdrop a bit at the Administration to hear what's happening since they came Only phones ringing and doors slamming. Really? Go hear Tanase Florescu, Ilie Nicolau, Maria Popescu and others lecturing in there now. A man just can't get some peace & quiet in life. Just when I thought that I ended up in a decent place Here we go again.. Commission. The bank was looking for you. The Planification Office also called in regard to some forms. There was also a call from the Minister's Office. What did he want? For you to be at his office at 12 o'clock. At Twelve? I've got time to go over my memorandum. The Commission probably submitted its evaluation. At least now I can make myself heard. The conclusions. The conclusion are missing. I'll write them now. Leave me alone, please. The conclusions! Is there a car around? Where the hell are the cars? Call the garage - Do something! Get moving! - What happened? What happened? Of course! They all crowd when it comes to prizes & overtime. When you need it most, you can't find anyone. But who can be blamed? - But what happened? - The conclusions! The Director went to the Minister and forgot the conclusions! He forgot the conclusions? Forgot the conclusions.. Forgot What conclusions actually? The conclusions for the memorandum. No more questions. You take them. Run! I'll run. The conclusions. Comrade Director, the conclusions. I've brought the conclusions. I ran as fast as I could, please believe me. Comrade Director, what are we doing with the conclusions? What could this mean? And Our director is gone for good D. G. B. It's an institution where I'd like to talk with Mr. Georje I mean, with comrade Ciubuc. - Ciubuc? - Yes. But what's his name? The same. - And he's over here? - Yes, he's new here Transferred from D. R. G. B. P. New? - Transferred from.. D.. uh.. - From there, yeah - Must be the small guy. - Not that small, he's my height. Then it's him. I'll get him. Comrade Marinache! I made a bit of time to come here. - Thanks so much, Ionescu. - No problem, goodbye now, I gotta run Stay some more You have no idea how happy I am to see you. It's like I'm seeing D. R. G. B. P. again with the functionary entrance. My heart is like so - I know, it's tough. - Really hard. When I told you we're in deep water and we're all gonna sink, you didn't worry at all. I was promoted. How could I fathom being transferred again? - And to this level? - At least you got off easy. It almost ended in a resignation notice in my case. - Now I gotta go. - No Why such hurry? Stay a bit more, it won't hurt. It will, it doesn't work like it did. - Can't afford to be late at all. - The director! Any news about him? He wound up as a storeman in a warehouse. That's what I heard. He didn't get off easy either. Sure didn't, nor the others. Many wound up bad. - Too bad for those beauties. - What beauties? Those armchairs. If you're kind, comrade, I need to Yes, yes. You? Comrade Direc tor No need anymore. Therefore you are here too. What were the chances? But take a seat, please. So? Do you like it here? I like it, what can I say. Did you like it from the beginning? - It was a bit hard in the beginning - And now? It's a bit better. Look why And about the what's your opinion? - It kind of creaked. - Indeed. That's why If it creaked, of course it was needed to fasten the screws. - That's the - only remedy, like you said - Right? - Yeah But how could you forget the conclusions? If you had not forgotten the conclusions You see Don't forget the conclusions If he had not forgotten the conclusions I wouldn't have ran so much. He didn't learn anything either The End Subtitles made by StefanCinema for KG and CG
