BASED ON TRUE EVENTS NETFLIX PRESENTS Breathe in, breathe out. Next time you breathe in, raise your arms, join hands, look at your thumbs, push your shoulders away from your ears. Breathe out, open your arms. There. Look at your left finger, your left hand. Good. Hold it. Good job, Alicia. Good. Feet form a right angle, Eleonora. There. Curl back up. Head is the last thing we lift. Keep your eyes closed, arms to the sides. Slow down the respiratory rate. Slow down the heart rate. All right, we open our eyes. Good job, girls. -See you on Thursday. -Thank you, Omar. -Thank you. -Thank you. -I've got an appetite now. -It was a great class. -Thank you. -I loved it. Me too. This cheesecake is delicious. -Can I have a slice, Alicia? -Sure. I think I stretched far too much. You'll feel better next time. -Have you heard from Beba? -She's in New York with a friend. A friend not from this group. She's been traveling nonstop since she became a widow. I hope she finds somebody. Can I have it? -Sorry, here. -How has Ignacio been? Good. He still goes to the office. I thought he had retired. He did, but he always finds an excuse to go. All the better for me, I don't have to deal with him all day. Auntie! That's beautiful. Is it for me? It's so pretty. Thank you. -I'm sorry, ma'am. -It's okay, Gladys. Go put it on the fridge. -Come with me. -No! Fine. He's so cute. -He's adorable. -He's grown a lot. By the way, we haven't seen your grandson in a while. Martin is the same age as Santi, right? Yes, they're both three. Ema turns three in May. My daughter is picking her kindergarten. They're unbelievably expensive. My daughter-in-law says they cost as much as college. It's crazy. Prices skyrocketed. -Auntie! -What, honey? -Look, a ball. -Oh, a ball! Eleonora is so fat! She really let herself go, Gladys. You and I should start a diet tomorrow or we'll end up like her. Yes, ma'am. Let me see that, Santi. What do you have in there? We have the dough here. What a lovely drawing. I want it on the fridge. Wanna come with me? Come on, let's put it on the fridge. There it goes. -What do we do with the dough? -The dough. You want to watch cartoons on the big screen, Santi? Yes! Let's go! Let's watch cartoons. -Where is the...? -Cartoons. Yes, we're going to watch cartoons. -What's that? -It came on. I want cartoons. -Shall we sit beside Mr. Bear? -Yes. Yes, right next to Mr. Bear. -Auntie. -Yes, honey? I want cartoons. Yes? This is a call from a prison inmate named... Daniel. To accept, press three. If you want to listen... Doctor. -Doctor. -I'll come by later. Daniel, honey. Daniel, darling. You look tired. Let's sit down. Well, tell us what happened. Marcela. She reported me again. Why? You said you were speaking again. Yes, but you know how she is. She lets me see Martin and I fall in her trap. Like us. When was the last time we saw him? -If I call her, she hangs up. -Wait. -Why were you brought here? -What do you mean? Daniel, you weren't kept in detention the other times. Exactly. But she beefed up the charges now. What does the public defender say? What can he say? Nothing. He has over 80 cases. He doesn't want to work. I can't stay here because of that idiot. I can't pay a lawyer. Calm down. Your dad will call Roberto. And we'll see what we can do. You look so thin. Can I bring you food? Yes, please do. And a packet of cigarettes and a phone card. Sure, whatever you need. My dear. Pereira. Door. Babe. Where are you going, honey? FIRST INSTANCE CRIMINAL COURT Come in. Take off her handcuffs and sit her over here. Full name. What's your name? Gladys Pereira. Just Gladys? No second name? Susana. Date of birth? April 30, 1996. Place of birth? Colonia Aurora, Misiones. Father's name? Your father. I don't have one. He died? What was his name? Alfonso Pereira. Mother's name? Your mother's name. Maria. Maria what? I never met her. ID number. Your identification number. I don't know it. Could it be 39-754-543? Yes. -Address? -I live with my employer. Where is that? Posadas 1550, sixth floor. -Buenos Aires? -Yes. I'll leave you with Mr. Vieytes so you can talk. I'll come back to take your statement. -How are you, Silvia? -Hi. Gladys, right? Okay. Gladys, I'm Pedro Vieytes. I've been appointed your public defender. Do you agree to that? -Yes. -All right. Please tell me what happened. You woke up at night, went to the bathroom... and what happened there? Do you remember going to the bathroom? I don't remember. Gladys, you're being accused of first-degree murder. Do you know what that means? Many years in jail. If you don't tell me what happened, I can't defend you. Silvia. Silvia, she's not ready to give testimony. I need another date and a psychological evaluation. But the judge wants to transfer her to prison. I know, but there's nothing I can do. Fine. As you wish. BILINGUAL KINDERGARTEN Hi. -Hi! -Auntie! Hi! Hi, honey. Give me a kiss. -Let's go, Auntie. -Let's go. Bye! I'm hungry, Auntie. What would you like? Some milk? -Taxi! -Yes. Taxi! Hail a taxi. With your hand. The last time he showed up here must've been six months ago. I'm sick of this. I told her, "Alicia, the boy is acting weird." Don't use the everyday sugar pot. Use the one from the set. I shouldn't have to explain this. You look dizzy. Are you pregnant? -No, ma'am. -Good, there's no room for one more. We have enough on our plate. You know how she is. It's impossible. -With a dash of milk? -It's fine like that, Alicia. So what are the chances of getting him out now? Slim, not to say impossible. There has to be a way, he hasn't been prosecuted yet. He has a previous sentence that was suspended for two years. What sentence? Well, violation of a restraining order and bodily injuries. -Is that still valid? -It sure is. Trashy, low-class scum. Excuse me, Roberto, but she's low-class scum. If he were to violate the law again with a sentence in place, all the blame would be on the judge, so he'll be kept in prison before the trial. Did you see that place? The people around him? -It's too dangerous. -There's nothing we can do, Alicia. -Don't give me that. -How long until the trial? I've known the DA for years. I told him Daniel was a friend's son, he's top of the list. Sixty days, and we'll have a trial.. -Two months? -Alicia... normal procedure usually takes six months to a year. It's true. There you go. Okay. Tell me about your family. Here. Sip it while it's hot. Tell me about your mom. She died when I was little. How old were you? Five, four. -Did you know your father? -Yes. Did he raise you on his own? Yes, sort of. What do you mean, "sort of"? He'd go into the hills and leave me behind. Alone at home all day? Sometimes for several days. Who took care of you? The dogs. They'd bark when they saw somebody. Wasn't there any neighbor or relative who could look after you? No. Our house was kind of isolated. Up on the hill. How was your dad when he was at home with you? He'd nap with me. Did he have a relationship after your mother? Yes, but it was worse. Why? Because I had to look after her kids. Do the cooking, the washing, the cleaning... everything. How old were you? Twelve, thirteen. How did you get to Buenos Aires, Gladys? A neighbor, Mrs. Teresa, bought me... sent me to Buenos Aires... to work for her daughter as a live-in maid. How did she do that? Did she tell your dad? No. She bought me a ticket and sent me with her daughter. Are you still in touch with that lady's daughter? No. You're not? She got a boyfriend and went back. Do you have a boyfriend? But you were seeing someone. Yes, Gladys, you did. Who's the father? Gladys. This way. Mr. Daniel Ignacio Arrieta, you're accused by the district attorney of criminal trespassing, illegal bearing of firearms, sexual assault and assault causing bodily harm in concurrence with the violation of a restraining order from Mrs. Marcela Sosa. You can now be heard by the court regarding these accusations. Please be advised of the following three points. You're not allowed to ask your lawyer questions during testimony. If you refuse to testify, such a refusal will not be held against you. And the trial will continue even if you don't testify. -Do you wish to testify? -I do, Your Honor. Take the stand, please. I would like to confirm your personal information. -Full name? -Daniel Ignacio Arrieta. -Nationality? -Argentinean. Your parents' names? Ignacio Jorge Arrieta and Alicia Campos. Marital status? -Married... Separated. -Separated or divorced? We're not divorced. What's your occupation, Mr. Arrieta? I'm self-employed. -What's your job? -I'm a retailer. What do you retail? Motorcycle spare parts. Where were you living when you were arrested? Garcia Lorca 484, apartment 3. You may start with your testimony. Excuse me? You may start giving your statement regarding the charges. That accusation is a lie. Marcela hasn't let me see my kid for over a year. She filed 23 reports against me to keep me away from him. And since it wasn't enough to send me to jail, she set me up, she asked me to come over to talk about Martin. I took the bait. She used to cheat on me with her workmates. I told the other judge, but they believed her. She treated me like crap all throughout our marriage. I had financial troubles in keeping my business afloat and I had to close it. I couldn't get a job and instead of supporting me, she was always putting me down. I started doing drugs because of her. She'd give me money to buy her drugs and I ended up using. Then I became an addict. But I've never stolen to buy drugs, I come from a good family. I was raised well. But life led me this way, and now my parents have to see this. I tried everything to give up drugs, but it was no use. Every time I made a step forward, Marcela's abuse would set me back. She treated me like dirt. She'd tell me I wasn't man enough. And she cheated on me. She'd work until late and that was her cover. She claimed to be working, but I knew she was cheating on me with her workmates. And I kept doing drugs to cope with that hell. Our marriage was broken. We would argue all the time. She'd shout at me so that the neighbors would hear. She would even beat me. Once I tried to defend myself and she used that to report me and take my son away. I haven't seen my son since that day. She never let me see him again. She turned him against me. My son refused to see me or to call me dad. She and her mother put ideas into his head. And I got desperate. I'd call her and she'd change her number. I'd call her mother's house, she'd say she wasn't in. I'd call her at work, no answer. I tried Facebook, e-mail, WhatsApp. She blocked me. And that made me more desperate, I just wanted to see my son. Do you know what that feels like? I had no choice but to go see her and she said I was threatening to kill her. She reported me, I was sent to trial. I got a restraining order from her and my son. My own son! She left me alone with the house debts. I was unemployed and with a record. My chances of getting a job were even lower with my addiction. I couldn't buy drugs, I couldn't take it anymore. I thought about committing suicide. Then she called saying that she wanted to talk about Martin. And I believed her. I took her bait. And here I am. I have nothing. I can't see my son, I'm broken and in jail. Is that all, Mr. Arrieta? Yes. Will you answer the other party's questions? No, I won't. You may leave the stand. Gladys? Gladys? Gladys. It's late. The girls will be coming soon. I'll be right there, ma'am. I'm just saying she could've told us beforehand. Right before coming, her daughter asked her to look after the kids. All the better, more for us. Alicia, are you feeling all right? You seem worried. I'm fine. You know, the usual drama, but I'm okay. Your daughter-in-law. I heard she reported Daniel again. Ex-daughter-in-law. She's making his life impossible. Your poor grandson, he has to live through all this. It's terrible. What happened now? He's in detention this time, right? -How do you know so much? -I don't, that's why I'm asking. She reported him so many times that the judge won't let him out. There are so many cases of women ruining their exes. Really? They take everything to court and the judges believe them. It's their way to keep the kids. You know the last time we saw Martin? Over a year ago. You can request a visit. You have a right as his grandmother. I know, but Ignacio and I decided not to interfere. -It can make things worse. -Yeah. -Bye, Alicia. -Bye. -Bye, dear. -Bye. On Thursday, the yoga class is at my house. I'll have to check, I'm having my house painted. -Take care. -I will. Please rise to take the oath. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? -Yes, I do. -Be seated, please. -Full name. -Ignacio Jorge Arrieta. -Age? -Seventy. -Marital status? -Married. -Occupation? -Engineer. Retired, sorry. -Where do you live? -Posadas 1550, sixth floor. -Do you know the defendant? -Yes. -What's your relationship with her? -She's our maid. She used to be our maid. During what period? From 2014... February 2014... until the recent events. Can your relationship with the defendant affect your capacity to tell the truth during interrogation? No. You'll be now interrogated by the district attorney. Thank you, Your Honor. Can you tell us how you met the defendant? Yes, a friend of my wife's recommended her. We needed a live-in maid. We gave her a trial, and then she started working and living in our house. She already had her son, Santiago, right? No, Santiago came much later. And how did you react? Well. My wife noticed she was pregnant. Gladys didn't know. She wasn't aware. When the defendant's baby was born, what did you do? We practically raised him ourselves. Gladys is a very simple woman. She's not educated. She grew up in the backwoods. But she was always very honest. One time some money went missing at home, and we never suspected her. Until the recent events. How was Gladys's relationship with her son, Santiago? Good. It was good. My wife taught her a lot on how to raise him. She'd always consult with her. -Did you meet his father? -Yes. A young man who worked in the neighborhood. The moment he heard about the baby, he disappeared. We didn't go into that because... I don't know, it's personal stuff. The district attorney has no more questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Arrieta. You may leave the stand. Gladys? Gladys, you forgot to put back the glass in the bathroom. -Where is it? -Over there, ma'am. We're eating out tonight. All right, ma'am. There's chicken and rice in the fridge. He has a fever, Gladys. -Prepare a warm bath for him. -Yes, ma'am. Santi has a fever. -What's wrong with him? -I don't know. But thank God I noticed. I don't know where her mind is lately. He needs a warm bath to see if he gets better. Why don't we stay? -You're joking, right? -I'm not, he's sick. Let his mother deal with it. We can't let Hector down. They're our friends. -Please. -Come on, Alicia. I don't want to go. Why not? I don't want them asking about Daniel. What does Daniel have to do with this? Roberto opened his big mouth because he's a gossip and now everybody knows. -He didn't. -He did. No. I told them about Daniel. I'm going. Are you coming? Could you tell us how you met the defendant? We met about seven years ago. He was distanced from his family at that time. He was at odds with his father, who had kicked him out. I was distanced from my family, too, so we clicked at once. He was very seductive, a grown man. I was still a girl. How old were you? He was 30, I was 22. We dated for some time, I got pregnant a year later and we moved in together. Actually, he moved in with me. He had closed his motorcycle dealership, and he had debts. The plan was to find a new job and help me with my pregnancy. But time passed by, Martin was born, and Daniel never found a job. I had to interrupt my maternity leave. There wasn't enough money for three of us, so I got a second job on the night shift. Did he help you raise the child? He looked after him while I was at work. But back from work, I had to deal with everything. Change diapers, clean the house, prepare the food. He wasn't very helpful. And he didn't stress himself over getting a job, especially once he started using. What did he use? At first, he'd drink a lot. Then he started doing cocaine, and then he smoked it. That's when the abuse started. He'd insult me, humiliate me. Even in front of my friends, who stopped visiting me. Then he got the crazy idea that I was cheating on him with my workmates. He'd call me a whore. Working 14 hours a day? At one point, I had three jobs. Was it only psychological abuse or it was physical, too? In the beginning, it was mistreatment. He'd spit at me, he'd force me to sleep outside my house. If he didn't like the food I'd made, he'd throw it at my face. His paranoia went out of control with the drugs. So I suggested doing couples therapy because I loved him, I believed we could work things out. He went twice and that's it. I continued going on my own. When the money ran out, he started smoking coca paste and he turned physical. It was better when he was high because he'd be unconscious and I could manage. The trouble was when he ran out of drugs, he'd get much more aggressive. I started giving him money to buy to keep him away from me and Martin. I thought about leaving, but I had nowhere to go. I wasn't on speaking terms with my family and I had no friends left. Besides, it was so much abuse and mistreatment, the lack of sleep, everything at once, that I had no time to think what to do. I was overwhelmed, I don't know how I survived. And when did you decide to leave your home? One day he ran out of coca paste and freaked out. He locked Martin and me in a room and started beating us. He beat my son. He threatened to kill us and kill himself afterwards. He grabbed a knife and I realized we wouldn't make it out alive. So when he got distracted, I grabbed my son and jumped out of the window. I had nowhere to go, so I stayed at a workmate's house. She helped me make the first report. After leaving your home with your son, did you see the defendant again? Yes. He found out where I lived and came with threats. -Death threats? -Yes. I lived in fear because I knew what he was capable of. So I kept reporting him until I got an order. A restraining order against him. But he didn't care, he'd keep coming. He'd say he wanted to get back with me. I'd say no and he'd flip out. -Did your report have any effect? -None. It was just paperwork. I didn't get police protection. There were no panic buttons. Only when he stabbed me did they pay any attention. -And the first trial took place. -Yes. He was given a two-year sentence, but it was suspended. The cure was worse than the disease because his grudge against me grew. How did he make a living during all that time? Did he have a job? No. The neighbors said he was a shut-in and sold the things inside the house. I left everything there, some savings, my furniture, two TV sets. Everything. He sold everything. My house was left empty. Please tell us what happened the night of the attack. I came back from work, he put a gun in my back and forced me into my house. I was terrified because Martin was being dropped off. I just wanted him to go before Martin arrived. He started threatening me. He asked me if I had been with Ruben, a workmate of mine. I didn't know whether to play along or not, he'd get mad anyway. We had a fight, he ripped my clothes off, and... He sexually abused you? Yes. -Did you offer any resistance? -I did, but he had a gun. I just wanted him to go before Martin came back. I didn't care. Luckily, when he heard the bell, he got scared and ran out. I don't know what would have happened if he had stayed. Thank you. That's all, Your Honor. Thank you, Mrs. Marcela Sosa. You may leave the stand. Watch it, it's hot. Blow. Ignacio, she's fucking up his life and still she called him a drug addict? Tell Roberto this is crazy. It's crazy to expect him to be declared innocent, Alicia. All he can do is plead guilty and say he was high. They don't have anything against him. -It's her word against his. -That's not true. Roberto talked with the DA. And? There are semen samples. Sure, she turned him on to get the tests done. Alicia, if the blood results match Daniel's DNA, with his record, he's done. Now, if he pleads guilty and claims to have been on drugs-- My son is not an addict! And least of all a rapist! Keep your voice down, okay? We must talk with that criminal lawyer... What's his name? -Hector's lawyer. -Who? Hector's? -Yes. -Echezabal? That one. Echezabal. He costs a fortune, Alicia. It's your son we're talking about. If we have to make sacrifices and tighten our belts, we'll do it. I know he's my son, but it's not about tightening our belts, Alicia. It's not only Echezabal's fee. It's the money for greasing the wheels. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive-- Gladys. -Yes, ma'am? -Come to the kitchen for your wages. In a minute, ma'am. -Come here, Gladys, please. -Yes, ma'am. Sign here. And count it, okay? We won't have the clothes ironed outside anymore. -You'll do it. -Yes, ma'am. And don't go to the health food store, they rip you off. -Yes, ma'am. -We'll do the shopping together. I don't know where all the money goes. -What were you doing back there? -Nothing. Nothing? I have a stomach ache. Come with me. I told you, those are hillbilly fantasies. Here, if your stomach aches, you take Buscopan. Twenty drops now and twenty at night. If you don't feel better by tomorrow, let me know. -Thank you, ma'am. -You're welcome. -Mrs. Arrieta, please follow me. -Thank you. This way, please. -Mrs. Arrieta. -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. I was hoping you could offer me an alternative, but judging by what you said, there isn't any. The scenario is quite complex. It demands more than a legal solution. I'm sorry, I don't understand. We'll lose in court. We need to find other ways to make them dismiss the case. It won't be easy or cheap, but it can be done. How much are we talking about? I believe around 400,000. Pesos, right? Dollars. We'll need a down payment to get started. Fifty percent of my fee can be tied to the result. I really don't think we can afford it. It's okay, think it over. Discuss it with your husband. Where there's a will, there's a way. Okay. I'm at your service. Thank you, sir. Gladys? Gladys, is that you? Ignacio, wake up. I heard noises and Gladys is not answering. Gladys! -Go check. -I'm going. Gladys. Gladys. Gladys. Gladys. Alicia. Alicia! Alicia! Thank you. Yes, of course, sir. Of course. He's about three, four years old. No. I don't believe he's in danger. Do you accept the temporary guardianship of the minor? Yes, of course. Okay, sir. I'll explain to them the procedure. All right. They'll go to the family court the day after tomorrow at the latest. No. Thank you. Next witness, please. Please be seated. You've been summoned to the criminal trial against Gladys Susana Pereira on a charge of first-degree murder. The clerk will inform you of the penalties for false testimony. One month to four-year prison sentence for witnesses who deny the truth, partially or fully, during their deposition before a jury. If the false testimony were to incriminate the accused, a one to ten-year sentence, and, in all cases, ineligibility for public positions for double the term of the sentence. Please stand up to take the oath. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? -I swear. -Be seated. Full name? Esteban Alejandro Palleros. -Occupation? -Physician. Where were you working on June 1st? I was on duty at SAME, the emergency service. Did you know the defendant before the event? No. You'll now be questioned by District Attorney Vitali. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Palleros, could you tell us what happened the night of June 1st? Yes, I was on duty and got a red-code emergency at Recoleta to assist a woman that was unconscious and bleeding. When I got there, the lady of the house told me she was her maid. Can you confirm the person you treated is the defendant? -Yes. -Go on, please. She was conscious but in shock. She had lost a lot of blood. I examined her and realized she had given birth. I asked her about the baby, but she didn't seem to understand. The man of the house told me she'd fainted in the bathroom. I went in there and found the baby's body in the shower. I checked its vitals and it was dead. Describe exactly what you saw when you went into the bathroom. There was blood on the floor and water, too. There was a bucket and a mop. Someone had tried to clean up. The shower curtain had bloodstains, too, somebody had pulled it. The baby was behind the curtain in the shower cubicle. Describe how the body was. It was on the floor, wrapped up in a towel. Can you confirm the cause of death of the baby? It died of asphyxia. You could tell he was not a stillborn. So he was born alive and asphyxiated later. That's right. What about a natural or induced abortion? The baby was born, it breathed, and was suffocated, according to the autopsy. What about strangulation with the umbilical cord? It was not around its neck, there were no marks. Thank you. Your Honor, the district attorney has no more questions. Defender? You said the baby's body was wrapped up in a towel. Can you be more specific? -It was wrapped up. -How? Like this. But was he bundled up like something you try and hide or swaddled like you would do to a baby? I don't know. I couldn't say. -Could you see its face? -Yes. So the towel covered the body, but not the face. Just like when you tuck in a baby. -I could see its face. -All right. You said the baby died of asphyxia, but he had no marks on its neck. How was he suffocated? The only way is by blocking the airways. -By covering the mouth and nose? -Yes. -Could it have been an accident? -What do you mean? Maybe the defendant tried to silence the baby and accidentally killed it. You should ask her. All I know is that it died of asphyxia. The defense has no more questions, Your Honor, thank you. They could come again with a search warrant. The police came three times this week, and a court secretary also. -Good afternoon, Roro. -Good afternoon, ma'am. She kept the boy. I don't know what will happen. If the neighbors will make any decision... Finally, he's asleep. It's so hard for him to sleep alone. He'll spend half the night in our room anyway. Ignacio, we must accept Echezabal's proposal. We've been considering cutting expenses for a long time. This is the time. It's the only way to save Daniel. He should plead guilty. If he pleads guilty, how is he going to get out of this? How are we going to get out of this? -I don't get you. -After what Gladys did, the media won't take long to find out our son is in jail. I'm sick of cleaning up your son's shit! First 100,000 for the bar, then his bikes. Then selling the store on Arenales to pay for all the mess he made with that dealership. The one time we were reasonable and refused to buy him a new car because his car was in perfect condition, he refused to let us see Martin for a year. You refused to give him the money. You can't have a little kid in an unsafe car. I'm sick of opening my wallet and closing my mouth. -I'm done with it. -I'm done with this. Let's get it over with for once. Fine, let's end this. Let's hire Echezabal and move to a smaller apartment, okay? Do whatever you want, but... without me. What do you mean? I'm out, Alicia. I'm tired of this. Can you tell us your specialty? I'm a psychologist specialized in infanticide. -You have evaluated my client. -Yes. Why do you think a quiet, submissive person with no record, like Gladys, would come to this? I should clarify these actions happen in an episode of extreme anguish. In many cases, like with Gladys, the mother doesn't remember what happened. -So it's similar to other cases? -Yes, it is. The common denominator is that the mother is convinced there's no pregnancy, so the baby will never be born. In Gladys's case, she was born and raised in extreme poverty. She suffered from domestic abuse. She's unable to be a mother. Her first son was raised by her employer. Her mother died when she was very little and her father's new partner made her work as a servant. She had a deep fear of the consequences that a new pregnancy could bring, to be precise, her employer's threat to kick her out should that happen. Finally, there's a possibility that the pregnancy was the result of a rape. The defense has no more questions, Your Honor. -District Attorney. -Thank you, Your Honor. Even if we were to consider your causes as valid, couldn't Gladys Pereira have found another solution to her problem? Even an abortion seems a less drastic solution than waiting nine months, giving birth to her baby and suffocating it. For Gladys, this birth was not going to happen. She already had a child, she was several months late, she weighed more. Didn't she suspect she was pregnant? It's more complex than that. The anguish of having an undesired baby plus the threat of being left homeless was too much for her. Denial in these mothers is so deep that they may not develop the symptoms, belly, or look of a pregnant woman. Denial is a natural defense mechanism we all use. You and I use it to avoid the anguish caused by the knowledge we'll die someday. All right, let's suppose denial made Gladys unaware of her baby. Once born, why didn't she give it up for adoption? She could have left it at a church and nobody would have noticed. No. Those weren't options for her. Gladys Pereira is semi-literate and she has a slight developmental delay. Despite her illiteracy and developmental delay, didn't it cross her mind that it's wrong to suffocate a newborn? I repeat, an unexpected delivery in a woman who didn't realize she was pregnant causes a shock that could block any kind of rational or moral thinking. And here. And here, Mrs. Arrieta. -Is that all? -That's all for now. All right. She... Marcela. Can she appeal? She can, but with no DNA test from the semen sample, I doubt it'll go a long way. SCIENTIFIC POLICE -What do I do with this? -Anything you want. It's yours. I suggest you get rid of it. When is my son coming out? I already appealed for lack of evidence. It's a question of days. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you, Mrs. Arrieta. It's a great kindergarten. Are you sure you don't want coffee? No, thanks. At this point in the school year, it's very hard to be admitted. But I talked with the principal and there will be no problem. I don't really think it's a good kindergarten. It's a very good option for him considering his circumstances. It has families from different backgrounds. It's a more diverse group. That will prevent him from being stigmatized. All right? With all he's going through right now, I don't want any more changes in his life. What he needs now is a space to feel comfortable among his peers. -Yes. -He needs friends. Healthy relationships, new acquaintances. This is a wonderful opportunity. A wonderful opportunity. I think instead of solving his problems, you're getting rid of him. No, Alicia, that's not true. We're very concerned. The whole faculty is very concerned about this issue. Did you tell Gladys Pereira there was no room for a second child? I didn't know she was pregnant. But perhaps you mentioned there wasn't any room for a second child. You are blaming me for what she did? What she did is unspeakable, sir. It's unforgivable. Not even animals do such a thing. And now it turns out I am responsible? After all I've done for her. When she came to my house, she could barely talk. We educated her. When she had her first son, I raised him. She didn't know she was pregnant, sir. When I took her to the doctor's, she was in her seventh month. Another employer would have kicked her out. I helped her with everything. I raised her son. I took him to the pediatrician's. I enrolled him in a good kindergarten. I even went to the parents' meetings because she can't deal with people. And I'm to blame for this atrocity? My God. I went through hell in my own house. We are facing public shame. You didn't answer the question, Mrs. Arrieta. Did you made any suggestion, comment, insinuation to Gladys Pereira that there was no room for another kid? Yes or no? No. The defense has no more questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Mrs. Arrieta, you may leave the stand. Thank you. Will we have enough time to cook? Schnitzels are hard work, you know. -Let's go, Auntie. -Let's cross the street. -What do I do? -Help me with the plates. Take it with both hands. Be careful. Don't drop it. It smells delicious, don't you think? I'm hungry. Here? Auntie. Very good, Santi. I name you the best assistant ever. That's him. -What? -The cartoon. Mom came. His mom. Very good. You like being fed, huh? -Auntie! -Sorry, just a sec. DANIEL: I'LL GET HOME LATE Santi, would you like some more? No. Auntie dropped the food. I did, but I'll cut this now and put it on your plate. -Hi. -Hi, Mom. Honey! -All good? -I'm so glad you're here. -Sorry, it's late. -It's okay. -I made schnitzels. -Schnitzels? -They're cold. Let me heat them up. -Great. -How are you? -Fine. Hungry. I'm so happy you're here. -Are you coming? -In a minute. It's for the best, Mom. Dad didn't appreciate you. It's a new beginning, a new opportunity. For everyone. I hope so. Maybe it had to do with what happened with Gladys. This is so good. It's been a while since I had this. Real food. -How about a coffee? -Yeah. Please. You know, I've been talking with Chino. -Remember him? -Yes. He's in the bike customization business. If we get 20,000 or 30,000 for the house, I could join him. It's a big opportunity, you buy bikes that are falling apart, customize them and sell them as collectibles. With my contacts, it's a golden chance. Chino has a good eye, but I have more experience. It'd be a good start. All rise, please. Be seated, please. Miss Gladys Susana Pereira, the court gives you a last opportunity to be heard. Do you wish to use that right? Your Honor, my client is not going to... Do you wish to be heard? Yes. Go on, please. I don't know what happened to me. Only God knows. I know my life is worthless. It's wasted. But Santi's life is important. He deserves a better life than mine. I know I have no right to ask for anything. But I'd like Mrs. Alicia to keep him. I want to apologize to Mrs. Alicia. Many bad things were said about her here. She was very nice to me. She's like a mother to me. And to Santi. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Pereira. I must clarify it's not in this court's jurisdiction to decide who will be granted your son's guardianship. But we'll inform the family judge in charge of that case of your statement. The clerk will now read the verdict. The members of the jury of criminal court number 20 of the independent city of Buenos Aires have reached a verdict on case 8975 with the charge of first-degree murder against Gladys Susana Pereira, ID number 39154543, Argentinean, single, elementary education: incomplete, occupation: domestic worker, address before arrest: Posadas 1550, current address: police station. After deliberation and according to the criminal code, we proceed to announce our ruling. This court declares Gladys Susana Pereira guilty of murder in the first-degree in mitigating circumstances and sentences her to 18 years of prison and the payment of court costs. Article 80, section 1. The full sentence shall be read on the 21st of this month at 10:00 AM, signed by Mr. Mariano Ventimiglia... ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Hi! -How was he? -He asked about his mother. Yeah? Come here. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. -I want Mom. -What do you want? -Mom. -Mom? Okay. Yes. You want to see Mom? Okay. Smile a little bit. -Done. -Okay. -This way? -Yes. Two minutes to go. Thank you, Mrs. Alicia. Thank you for bringing him. Thank you for everything you do for him. You know I love him as if he were mine, Gladys. Mrs. Alicia... Santi should be yours after what I did to you. Don't say that. I didn't know what to do. He said he'd kill me and Santi if I told you. But then he never came back to the house. Who are you talking about, Gladys? That time some money went missing... Your son asked me to let him in, and I did. That's when he forced me. That's why you should keep Santi. I owe you. The baby was your son's. -Time's up. Hurry up, Gladys. -I love you, Santi. Be a good boy and do what Mrs. Alicia says. Bye, Santi. Open the door. Easy. Don't run, Santi. What was that? What happened, Santi? Where are you? What happened? Are you okay, Auntie? -That goes to Juncal. -Okay. Moving is such a hassle. -Have you talked with Daniel? -No. One at a time, please. There's glass in there. I have to watch them. LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION NO MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN -Come in. -Thank you. Once she serves half her time and if she has good conduct, she'll have day parole. -Eighteen years is so unfair. -It is. -Can't we appeal for a reduction? -Of course we can. We can always appeal. But all we have is Gladys's statement, and that's not much. I'm willing to testify as well. But you already did, Mrs. Arrieta. Unless you can provide some new element. Unless we have something solid to add, the appeal won't be successful. It's not that easy. It's difficult. Hi, Martin. Hi, honey. Get back inside, Martin. Get back in. What are you doing here? I brought you this. -Where did you get it? -It doesn't matter. I hope it's not too late. Give it to the DA. Bye. SCIENTIFIC POLICE -Hi. -Hi. Hi, Alicia. -Gladys Pereira's appeal? -Yes. Come in, please. Thank you. NATIONAL APPEALS COURT CRIMINAL DIVISION Look what I've got. Is that milk? Yes, milk to dip the chocolate cookies for your birthday cake. What are you doing? Don't break it. It's funny, isn't it? It's very funny. One more. There. Put it there. One more. This is a call from a prison inmate named... Daniel. What's the number here? -Here. -Here? No, not this one. The next one, I think. -Let's see. -Here? Yay! -Shall we go in? -It's here, Auntie! Yes, let's knock on the door. Did they hear you? Yes, they did. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Come in. Let's go. Wait. Do you wanna give it to him? -Wait. Hello. -Hi. Hi. -Thank you. -Thank you for inviting us. Hello. -Let's go, honey. -Let me hold this. I was not letting it go. Hi, Martin. Careful, honey. This present is for you, happy birthday. Careful. Let me take it out. It's down at the bottom. Here it is! Good job, guys. Happy birthday, Martin. Do you like it? "With her last remaining strength, she dragged herself out to the privy And there, near dawn, unceremoniously, she was delivered. Then she, now totally confused, Half froze and found she could scarcely hold the child For the servants' privy lets in the heavy snows. And you I beg, make not your anger manifest For all that lives needs help from all the rest." Extract from The Infanticide Marie Farrar, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) Subtitle translation by Lisa Pagotto
