Man: STEP BACK, PLEASE. I JUST WANT AN AUTOGRAPH! SEE THAT SHE GETS IT TONIGHT. YES, I WILL. Man: THOMAS SCULLY IS HERE TONIGHT. HE'S A VERY FINE PAINTER, FANNY. I WANT YOU TO MEET HIM. HE'S ASSURED ME HE CAN PAINT A TRUE LIKENESS OF YOU. NO, FATHER, NO ONE CAN PAINT ME AS I AM, BECAUSE I AM NOT WHAT I APPEAR TO BE. THATIS A TRUE STATEMENT. ELIZABETH! YOU SAID ONLY A FEW PEOPLE. THESEAREONLY A FEW PEOPLE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MIND THE CHILD FOR A WHILE? IF IT WERE ONLY POSSIBLE. HA HA HA HA! TONIGHT WAS MY LAST PERFORMANCE IN AMERICA. THE AUDIENCE COUGHED TOO MUCH, DID THEY? OH, I'M SORRY. WHAT THE MATTER? EVERYTHING. BLUNDERING ACTORS WHO DIDN'T KNOW THEIR PARTS, COMATOSE AUDIENCES, AND AMERICA. I'M TIRED OF SPITTOONS AND BAD BRANDY AND COMPETING WITH WILD PIGS FOR SPACE ON THE SIDEWALKS. SO THIS IS THE CAPRICIOUS KEMBLE WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT. INTRODUCE US, MRS. SEDGWICK. FANNY, THIS IS JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, THE ESTEEMED FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND DANIEL WEBSTER, SENATOR AND FAMOUS ORATOR. FANNY WAS JUST SAYING HOW MUCH SHE LOVES AMERICA. FINEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS ENGLISH. BY THE BYE, SHE LOVED SHAKESPEARE, ADORED IT. YOU WERE QUITE GOOD TONIGHT. WOMEN WEPT. BUT I THINK DESDEMONA'S MISFORTUNE IS A VERY JUST JUDGMENT UPON HER FOR MARRYING A NIGGER. DESDEMONA'S FAULT WAS BEING IN LOVE, SIR. OTHELLO'S ERROR WAS PRIDE... NOT BEING A NEGRO, A CONDITION OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL. GOOD EVENING. EXCUSE ME. WHAT I WONDER IS IF YOU'VE EVER HAD ANY CONTROL OVER YOURMOUTH. NOW, WHAT IS THE MATTER? I AM SICK TO DEATH OF BEING FANNY KEMBLE. I'M SO GOOD AT IT I DON'T DARE BE ANYONE ELSE. WELL, THAT'S HONEST. WHAT'S TO BE DONE? FANNY, THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU. COME. AND NOW OUR NEXT MUSICIAN IS PIERCE BUTLER WHO WILL PLAY A FLUTE SONATA BY CARULLI, ACCOMPANIED BY MR. AVELEN ON THE GUITAR. I WOULD LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS PIECE TO OUR CHARMING GUEST OF HONOR, MISS FANNY KEMBLE. ♪♪ ♪♪ ( continues ) ( sonata ends to applause ) WHAT'S IN A NAME? THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD SMELL AS SWEET. ♪♪ ( dance music ) Fanny: NOT ONLY DO YOU KNOW SHAKESPEARE, YOU PLAY THE FLUTE VERY WELL, MR. BUTLER. ARE YOU A MUSICIAN? IF MY MUSIC MOVES YOU I AM, OTHERWISE I AM MERELY A DULL LAWYER. I'M SURPRISED YOU FOUND TIME TO LEAVE ROSES FOR ME THROUGHOUT THE TOUR. I DON'T RECALL SAYING I DID. PERHAPS YOU'RE TOO ASHAMED TO CONFESS IT. IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER SIGNED YOUR NAME? IF I HAD SIGNED MY NAME, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE MOON-FACED ADMIRERS GAPING AT US THROUGH THE WINDOWS; I WANTED TO BE THE ONE DANCING WITH YOU, AND TALKING TO YOU IN THE GARDEN. BUT HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT FROM THEM? THEY'RE ONLY DAZZLED BY THE ROLES I PLAY. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU BETTER. "IN THE INMOST CHAMBERS OF MY SOUL, THERE IS ANOTHER WORLD, A BLESSED HOME O'ER WHICH NO LIVING POWER HOLDETH CONTROL, CLOSE TO WHICH ILL THINGS DO NEVER COME." I READ YOUR BOOK OF POETRY. THOSE POEMS ARE THE FOOLISH MUSINGS OF A YOUNG GIRL. THE FACT THEY'RE EVEN PUBLISHED IS MY ETERNAL PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING WRITTEN THEM. WELL, I'M VERY GLAD YOU DID. I KNEW THE POET WAS RARE-- I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS ALSO BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SOUND A LOT LIKE A MOON-FACED ADMIRER YOURSELF, MR. BUTLER. WOULD YOU FEEL SAFER IF I WERE? IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO. ONCE WE GO BACK INSIDE, YOU BELONG TO THEM. I MUCH PREFER HAVING YOU ALL TO MYSELF. GOOD NIGHT, MISS KEMBLE. I THINK I'D PREFER THAT TOO, MR. BUTLER. "OUR PERFORMANCE OFOTHELLO WAS WELL RECEIVED, THOUGH ON THE WHOLE, PHILADELPHIA AUDIENCES CANNOT DISTINGUISH GOOD THEATER FROM A CATTLE RACE. AFTER THE PERFORMANCE, I RECEIVED YET ANOTHER SINGLE WHITE ROSE. BUT THE MYSTERY IS FINALLY OVER. ELIZABETH'S SOIREE WAS WITLESS BUT MILDLY INTERESTING-- MY LAST, I VOW-- BUT IT WAS THERE THAT MY SECRET ADMIRER MADE HIS PRESENCE KNOWN. HIS NAME: PIERCE BUTLER. HE WAS SO BRASH AND I WAS SO ALOOF, BOTH OF US PLAYING OUR PARTS, BUT HE LIKED THE ONLY GOOD POEM I'VE EVER WRITTEN, AND HE PLAYED THE FLUTE HAUNTINGLY. QUITE HANDSOME, TOO." MISS KEMBLE! MISS KIMBLE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OF COURSE I'M ALL RIGHT. WHY DO YOU ASK? I THOUGHT YOUR HORSE HAD RUN AWAY WITH YOU. WHAT A PREPOSTEROUS IDEA. HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING ME, MR. BUTLER? OH, NO. WELL, YES. I PAID THE STABLE BOY SIX SHILLINGS TO TELL ME WHERE YOU RODE; I WANTED TO ESCORT YOU. I THOUGHT THE RAIN MIGHT HAVE MADE THE TRAILS UNFIT FOR LADIES, BUT I CAN SEE I UNDERESTIMATED YOU. GOOD DAY, MISS KEMBLE. WELL, THE TRAILS ARE UNFIT FOR LADIES, MR. BUTLER, BUT I WOULD ENJOY YOU ESCORTING ME NONETHELESS. DO YOU ALWAYS RIDE AT THAT PACE? NO, ON THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY I TROT RESPECTFULLY. I'M SURPRISED YOU WOULD DEFER TO ANYONE, MISS KEMBLE, EVEN A QUEEN. I DID NOT SAY I WOULD DEFER; ONLY THAT I TROT. ( laughs ) IS THIS YOUR FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA? I SENSE THAT YOU DON'T CARE FOR IT MUCH. I CAN'T BLAME YOU. YOU'VE ONLY SEEN DIRTY CITIES AND THE INSIDES OF THEATERS AND PEOPLE FAWNING ALL OVER YOU. YOU SHOULD HAVE ME AS YOUR PERSONAL GUIDE. YOU'RE VERY BOLD, MR. BUTLER. THIS IS A GRAND COUNTRY, MISS KEMBLE-- IT INVITES GUMPTION. STAY ON AFTER YOUR TOUR IS COMPLETED. I'LL GIVE YOU THE EYES OF AN AMERICAN. I THINK IN YOUR HEART AND SOUL YOU ALREADY ARE ONE. ( Fanny chuckles ) YOU SEE THAT TREE LINE OVER THERE? LAST ONE THERE HAS NO GUMPTION. HEEYA! GO! GO! HEEYA! GO! COME ON! GO! RUN! GO! GO! DO I HAVE GUMPTION, MR. BUTLER? ( laughs ) OH, YOU DO INDEED, MISS KEMBLE. I PRONOUNCE YOU AN HONORARY AMERICAN. ( both laugh ) RIDING ALONE WITH UNATTACHED MEN, RACING THEM ON HORSEBACK. FORTUNATELY, YOUR MOTHER IS IN ENGLAND. WELL, HE WAS CHARMING. AND AT LEAST HE DOESN'T CHEW TOBACCO LIKE MOST AMERICAN MEN. I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A GENTLEMAN SPIT UPON THE CARPET IN THE COMPANY OF WOMEN WITHOUT EVEN A HINT OF REMORSE. OH! APPALLING. BETWEEN RACES, DID HE MENTION THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE, PERHAPS? MARRIAGE? PIERCE IS MERELY AN AMUSING FRIEND. BESIDES, I WOULD NEVER MARRY A FOOL, WHICH ANY MAN WHO WANTED TO MARRY ME WOULD HAVE TO BE. HA HA HA! BUT THE QUESTION IS, WOULD YOU MARRY HIM? I TOLD YOU WE'RE FRIENDS. WHY DO YOU EVEN ASK? YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO DIVE IN BEFORE TESTING THE DEPTH, FANNY. HAS THE SUBJECT OF PIERCE'S 600 SLAVES ARISEN AT ALL? THEY'RE NOT HIS, THEY'RE HIS GRANDFATHER'S. ONLY TILL HIS AUNT DIES AND THEN THEY'RE HIS, AND SHE'S ON HER DEATH BED. MY GOD, I'M MEDDLING. PIERCE IS NOT A PERSON WHO KEEPS SLAVES. ARE YOUR PLANTATIONS AS LARGE AS ALL THIS? THEY AREN'T MINE YET, BUT THEY ARE MUCH LARGER. AND ARE THERE SLAVES? YES. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE IN THE SOUTH. I CANNOT IMAGINE A LIFE WITHOUT FREEDOM. OF COURSE NOT; IT'S NOT YOUR LIFE. BUT I GREW UP WITH IT. THE BUTLER ISLAND SLAVES HELPED RAISE ME. I LOVE THEM, AND THEY LOVE ME. THEY'RE HAPPY AND WELL CARED FOR; THEY HAVE NO WISH TO BE FREE. BUT YOU COULD FREE THEM IF YOU CHOSE TO. OF COURSE I COULD, FANNY, NOTHING COULD BE EASIER. IT'S QUITE LOVELY HERE; IT REMINDS ME OF ENGLAND. YOU SOUND HOMESICK. HAS YOUR GUMPTION FAILED YOU ALREADY? WHAT DO YOU WANT, FANNY? I MEAN TRULY. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. AND I HAVE PLENTY OF GUMPTION TO DO IT. UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS BORN A WOMAN AND RAISED BY ACTORS. THOSE ARE ADVANTAGES, NOT IMPEDIMENTS. OH, PIERCE, EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS SAID NO TO ME. I KNOW YOUR HEART, FANNY. WHY AREN'T YOU MARRIED? I KNOW YOU'VE HAD MANY SUITORS. WHY HAVE YOU ALWAYS REJECTED THEM? WHY WOULD I SWEAR BEFORE GOD TO BE ANY MAN'S DOCILE ORNAMENT? I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP MY FREEDOM. MEN THINK THEY WANT TO MARRY ME, BUT IT'S NOT THEIR BRAINS DOING THE THINKING. PERHAPS NO ONE HAS EVER LOVED YOU AS I DO. I WOULD NEVER ATTEMPT TO RESTRICT YOU.EVER. I'M NOT INTERESTING IN ORNAMENTS OR BLIND OBEDIENCE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LIFE YOU DESERVE. IT WOULD ENRICH ME TO EVEN TRY. I LOVE YOU, FANNY, I DO. I WANT TO MARRY YOU... RIGHT AWAY. THE RAVEN HIMSELF IS HOARSE THAT CROAKS THE FATAL ENTRANCE OF DUNCAN UNDER MY BATTLEMENTS. COME, YOU SPIRITS, THAT TEND ON MORTAL THOUGHTS. UNSEX ME NOW AND FILL ME FROM THE CROWN TO THE TOE TOP FULL OF DIRE CRUELTY. MAKE THICK MY BLOOD-- ELIZABETH! YOU ARE SO UTTERLY CONVINCING. DID YOU COME HERE TO WATCH ME REHEARSE... OR TO LECTURE ME ON THE PERILS OR MARRIAGE? WELL, SINCE YOU BRING IT UP... YOU HAVE LONG DECLARED YOUR DISDAIN FOR MARRIAGE, FANNY. YET YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE UP BEING SINGLE AND INDEPENDENT TO SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH A MAN. THE QUESTION IS: WHY? BECAUSETHISIS MY LIFE-- HOLED UP BACKSTAGE OR ACTING THE FOOL ONSTAGE. MY LIFE HAS BEEN PREDICTABLE. BUT PIERCE ISN'T. HE SURPRISES ME. AND ALL OF THE EMOTIONS THAT I'VE ACTED ON STAGE, I NOWFEEL. THEY'RE REAL. YOU'RE HOPING TO LEAVE THE FANNY KEMBLE YOU'RE SO SICK OF BEHIND? SHE MAY FOLLOW YOU, YOU KNOW. WHEN I'M WITH PIERCE, I DON'T HAVE TO BE FANNY KEMBLE. I ADORE BEING WITH HIM. I LOVE HIM. DON'T RUIN IT, ELIZABETH. I'M VERY PLEASED FOR YOU. I JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. YOU MUST KNOW THAT. OH... Fanny:WE WERE MARRIED, AS PIERCE WISHED, RIGHT AWAY. FATHER DID NOT APPROVE, MOSTLY BECAUSE IT ENDED OUR TOUR PREMATURELY. BUT MY STAGE CAREER HAS ENDED AT LONG LAST. WE MOVED INTO BUTLER PLACE, PIERCE'S CHILDHOOD HOME OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA. I WOULD NEVER TELL HIM, BUT IT'S LITTLE MORE THAN A SECOND-RATE FARMHOUSE BY ENGLISH STANDARDS. BUT HE HAS ASSURED ME THAT WE WILL BE TRAVELING EXTENSIVELY, SO I DON'T MIND. AND MARRIAGE DOES HAVE ITS SINGULAR ADVANTAGES... YOU ARESOBEAUTIFUL. I CAN BEAR THE SUSPENSE NO LONGER. I MUST KNOW, DID YOU FINISH READING MY JOURNAL? YES, I HAVE. YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT WRITER, FANNY, VERY OBSERVANT AND DETAILED. I AM SO PLEASED. I WANT TO PUBLISH IT AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO HELP MY FATHER. HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF COVENT GARDEN THEATER. WE COULD ARRANGE A LOAN AGAINST MY INHERITANCE IF THAT WOULD HELP. HE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT IT, BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO. I SENT MY JOURNAL TO CAREY, LEA & BLANCHARD. THEY PUBLISHED MY POEMS; THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE JOURNAL, AND THEY WANT TO PROCEED. I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE, FANNY. THEY ARE YOUR PRIVATE REFLECTIONS, AND IN MY OPINION, SHOULD REMAIN SO. WELL, MANY WRITERS PUBLISH THEIR JOURNALS. ESPECIALLY THEIR THOUGHTS ON COMING TO A NEW COUNTRY. I TOLD YOU, FANNY, I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE. BUT IT'S MY JOURNAL, AND I'LL PUBLISH IT IF I WISH! I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SOUND SO ADAMANT. I WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN. PERHAPS WITH PROPER EDITING IT CAN BE MADE PRESENTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. EDITING?? NO! IT MUST BE PUBLISHED INTACT. I WOULDN'T EVEN ALLOW MR. CAREY TO EDIT IT. FANNY, PLEASE. IT IS FILLED WITH CRITICISMS AND EXAGGERATIONS. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. FOR WHOM? YOU MADE ME BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD WAS OPEN TO ME. WHY ARE YOU RESTRICTING ME? I'M NOT; I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR HUSBAND. THIS COULD HARM YOU GREATLY. HARM ME? I'M HARDLY AS DELICATE AS THAT, PIERCE. I WAS WEANED ON CRITICS. BUT I WILL NOT BE IDLE. YOU'RE RARELY HOME, WE NEVER GO TO THE THEATER OR A BALL, THE ROAD IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR FRIENDS TO VISIT, AND FOR ALL THE ADVENTURES THAT I HAD ANTICIPATED, YOU JUST SAY, "IN TIME." I EXIST IN AN INTELLECTUAL DROUGHT HERE, AND I AMGOING TO PUBLISH MY JOURNAL. I HAVE ALREADY CALLED MR. CAREY AND ASKED HIM TO HALT PUBLICATION. YOU READ MY MAIL. HOW DARE YOU! THIS IS MY BUSINESS, NOT YOURS! YOU CANNOT BLITHELY DECIDE WHETHER MY WORK IS TO BE PUBLISHED OR NOT! I WROTE THIS JOURNAL, AND WHAT BECOMES OF IT ISMYDECISION! NO, FANNY. YOU TOOK AN OATH TO OBEY ME, AND YOU WILL RESPECT MY WISHES. I WILL GLADLY EDIT THE JOURNAL. UNDER NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I PERMIT IT BE PUBLISHED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? NO. I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU LOVED ME. I CAN SEE THAT I HAVE BEEN GREATLY DECEIVED. ( door slams ) HOW DID THE NEWSPAPERS GET AHOLD OFTHIS? "THE SHEEP IS ON THE OTHER FOOT. FANNY THIMBLE, FIERCE CUTLER..." WHY, I HAD NO IDEA. I GAVE THE MANUSCRIPT TO MR. CAREY IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE. YOU SHOULD ASKHIM. THE WHOLE CITY'S IN AN UPROAR! MAY I REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE A GUEST IN AMERICA, AND YOU SHOULD HONOR THE PRIVILEGE? YES. AMERICA, BASTION OF FREE SPEECH UNTIL SOMEONE DARES EXPRESS AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION. WHY DIDN'T THEY REPORT THE MANY FAVORABLE OBSERVATIONS I MADE, THE THINGS ILIKEABOUT AMERICA? YOU REFERRED TO NEWSPAPER WRITERS AS "IRRITATING BUGS"! WHAT IN GOD'S NAME DID YOU EXPECT?! WELL, THEYAREBUGS, AND THIS PROVES IT. HOW CAN YOU TAKE THEIR SIDE AGAINST ME? I WILL NOT HAVE YOU BEHAVE THIS WAY TOWARD ME, FANNY. I'M WARNING YOU. I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD THAT MR. CAREY WOULD NOT STOP PUBLICATION OF MY JOURNAL. EIGHT HUNDRED COPIES SOLD IN THE FIRST DAY. SO MUCH FOR ADVERSE PUBLICITY. I LIKE THE PART ABOUT THE PHILADELPHIA WOMEN HAVING "ABOMINABLY LARGE FEET AND HORRID DARK COMPLEXIONS." THAT WENT OVERVERYWELL. I'M CONSIDERING A DIVORCE. WELL, DO YOU KNOW THAT WOULD RUIN HIM? HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD OSTRACIZE HIM. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? HAVE CHILDREN, FANNY. FEW THINGS BRING PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER THAN HAVING CHILDREN. I HAD THOUGHT THAT MARRIAGE WOULD BE A COMPANIONSHIP ON EQUAL TERMS... THAT IF THERE WERE DISAGREEMENTS, NEITHER ONE WOULD BE FORCED TO YIELD OR BE DICTATED TO BY THE OTHER. I LOVE PIERCE, BUT IT'S NOT IN ME TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE TO ANY HUMAN BEING WHO'S AS FALLIBLE AS I AM. I OWE OBEDIENCE TO GOD, AND ONLY TO GOD, AND I CANNOT SEE HOW HAVING CHILDREN WILL CHANGE THAT, ELIZABETH. HE KNOWS HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM IS TO ME. YET HE'S ONLY DENIED IT. WHY HAS HE DONE THIS? WELL, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT? HE'S A MAN OF HIS ERA WHO MARRIED A WOMAN COMPLETELY OUT OF HERS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHILDREN DO BEST? THEY TAKE OUR RIGID PHILOSOPHIES AND THEY TURN THEM UPSIDE-DOWN. AND IF YOU THINK PIERCE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO'S INTRACTABLE, LOOK IN THE MIRROR. Fanny:SADLY, ELIZABETH WAS WRONG. AS MUCH AS WE LOVE OUR PRECIOUS GIRLS, IT HAS NOT RESOLVED OUR DIFFICULTIES. PAPA! HELLO, SUGAR. ( baby crying ) WELCOME HOME, PIERCE. WE'VE MISSED YOU VERY MUCH. FANNY. THE OVERSEER'S EXCELLENT. HIS GRANDFATHER WAS THE OVERSEER FORMYGRANDFATHER. COTTON PRODUCTION ON ALL THE PLANTATIONS WAS IN EXCESS OF 2600 BALES; THAT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR. AND WE NOW HAVE OUR OWN STEAM MILL... ( sighs ) I CAN SEE THAT I'M BORING YOU. ACTUALLY, PIERCE, YOU'RE NOT. WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT TAKING ME AND THE CHILDREN WITH YOU FOR THE WINTER? TO GEORGIA? YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. YES, I AM. PERHAPS A NEW PLACE AWAY FROM THE MEAN-SPIRITED GOSSIPS OF PHILADELPHIA WOULD GIVE US A CHANCE TO REDISCOVER WHAT ONCE DREW US TOGETHER. FOR ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES, PIERCE, I DO LOVE YOU. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU LOVE AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED. I'M VERY TOUCHED, FANNY. BUT YOU MUST KNOW IT'S AN EXTREMELY HARSH LIFE DOWN THERE. I'VE HAD A VERY SOFT LIFE, PIERCE, TO MY DETRIMENT AND TO THOSE I LOVE. LET ME TRY ANOTHER WAY. ( indistinct chatter ) ( all shout greetings ) WELL... THIS IS BUTLER'S ISLAND. IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL. FANNY, THIS IS OWEN PARKER. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. PARKER. MR. BUTLER. HELLO, OWEN. COME ALONG, SUGAR. I'M GOING TO LIKE IT HERE. MM-HMM. I'M GOING TO LIKE IT, TOO. SHAD HALL DROWNED LAST FRIDAY. I'LL TAKE IT. SO I GOT HABERSHAM MUNGIN TO TAKE HIS PLACE AT THE STEAM MILL. GOT THREE NEW BABIES, AND EIGHT WOMEN ARE PREGNANT. I SWEAR, THEY GET PREGNANT DURING PLANTING SEASON JUST SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK. NOW, YOU TAKE A HORSE, IT'LL WORK PREGNANT UP TO THE DAY IT GIVES BIRTH, AND IT'S BACK TO WORK THE NEXT DAY. SURELY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, MR. PARKER. Fanny:"DEAR ELIZABETH, I'VE DECIDED TO KEEP A JOURNAL OF MY SOUTHERN SOJOURN IN THE FORM OF LETTERS TO YOU. THAT WAY I CAN TRUTHFULLY TELL PIERCE THAT I'M NOT KEEPING A JOURNAL. THE SEA ISLANDS HAVE A KIND OF BARREN, WILD BEAUTY, AND FROM WHAT LITTLE I'VE SEEN, CIVILIZATION DOES NOT EXIST. WHAT EXISTS IS SLAVERY, AND SLAVES. IN MY NAIVETE, I HAVE NEVER FULLY CONSIDERED THE HARSH REALITY OF IT." MORNIN', MISSUS. MY NAME'S JACK, I'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR PERSONAL DOMESTIC WHILE YOU'RE HERE. I KNOW LOTS OF WORDS, LIKE "DOMESTIC," WHICH MOST NIGGERS DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M VERY SMART. I CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE, I CAN TELL YOU WHERE THE QUICKSAND IS OR HOW NOT TO RILE UP THE SNAKES, JUST TO START WITH. MY MAMA SAYS THAT I MAKE UP IN TALKING WHAT I DON'T DO IN WORKING, AND SHE'S RIGHT, 'CAUSE I'M A REAL TALKER. WELL, I HAPPEN TO ENJOY TALKING, JACK, SO WE SHOULD GET ALONG JUST FINE. YES'M. WELL, I'M REAL GLAD ABOUT THAT, MISSUS, REAL GLAD. NOW, YOU KNOW WHERE THE PLANTATION IS? WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU EVERYTHING, JUST FOLLOW ME, MISSUS. COME ON.

( crying, groaning ) Aunt Jerusalem: OKAY, OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S PROBABLY JUST SLEEPIN', SAVIN' UP TO GET BORN. CAN'T YOU CALL HER A DOCTOR? AIN'T NO DOCTORS FOR NIGGERS, MISSUS. WELL, I'LL SPEAK WITH MY HUSBAND. MISSUS, CAN YOU ASK HIM FOR ME, TOO? WELL, YES. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? HARRIET. I HAVE THREE BABIES DIE ALREADY, MISSUS, AND I THINK THIS ONE GONNA DIE TOO! AND I CAN'T HAVE NO MORE BABIES, MISSUS, THAT'S IT. I'LL SHOW YOU. OH, MY GOD. YES, HARRIET. I-I'LL SPEAK WITH HIM. ( baby crying ) I KNOW THEY'RE ALL AT THE INFIRMARY, MRS. BUTLER. BEEN THAT WAY FOR 17 YEARS. AIN'T NO REASON TO CHANGE IT NOW. NIGGERS IS FILTHY CREATURES BY NATURE. BESIDES, THEY'RE STRONGER THAN WHITES. MOST OF 'EM GET WELL SOON ENOUGH. I'M NOT BLIND, SIR. HARRIET IS NOT WELL, AND SHE'S STILL BEING FORCED TO WORK IN THE FIELDS. FANNY... THIS DOES NOT CONCERN YOU. YOU GOTTA THINK OF NIGGERS DIFFERENTLY, MRS. BUTLER. THEIR SUBSERVIENT ATTITUDE, THE WAY THEY FLATTER, ALL THEIR LYING AND STEALING, THE WAY THEY SMELL-- IT'S WHO THEY ARE. CODDLIN' WILL RUIN 'EM. BESIDES, IF SLAVES WERE DYING IN THE INFIRMARY, MAYBE I'D CHANGE THINGS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DANGER OF YOU CODDLING SLAVES, MR. PARKER. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY APPETITE. SHE WAS AN ACTRESS. YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE. MAYBE YOU COULD PUT A FEW NEW BLANKETS DOWN THERE, CLEAN IT UP SOME, BUT YOU SHOULD RUN THINGS AS YOU SEE FIT, OWEN. I'LL KEEP MRS. BUTLER IN LINE. IF YOU DON'T, WE'LL HAVE 600 SLAVES AT OUR THROATS. AAAAH! ( whipping, screaming ) STOP! AAAAH! STOP THIS! THIS AIN'T NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, MRS. BUTLER. WHY ARE YOU PUNISHING HER? NONE OF THIS AIN'T YOUR FAULT! IS IT BECAUSE SHE COMPLAINED TO ME? IS IT NOT SO?! AAAAH! ( whipping continues ) MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU? MR. PARKER IS HAVING HARRIET FLOGGED FOR COMING TO SEE ME. DO YOU KNOW THIS? I ORDERED IT. HOW COULD YOU? HAVE YOU NO COMPASSION? YOU CAUSED IT, FANNY, NOT I. WE HAVE RULES HERE, AND YOU ENCOURAGED HARRIET TO BREAK THEM. SLAVES ARE TO BE WHIPPED FOR EXPRESSING LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES, IS THAT A RULE? THEIR GRIEVANCES ARE RARELY LEGITIMATE. AND THEIR PHYSICAL COMPLAINTS ARE ALWAYS EXAGGERATED. YOU DON'T KNOW THEM. TO RILE THEM UP AS YOU DID IS DANGEROUS AND DISRUPTIVE. I WILL NOT HAVE YOU INTERFERING IN A SYSTEM WHICH YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT I UNDERSTOOD WAS YOUR ASSURANCE THAT THEY WERE HAPPY AND WELL CARED FOR. I SUPPOSE YOUR PROMISE TO FREE THEM WAS EQUALLY HYPOCRITICAL. IF I FREED THEM, WHERE WOULD THEY GO? WHAT WOULD THEY DO? THEY WOULD BE CAPTURED AND SENT TO PLANTATIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BE TREATED FAR WORSE! THEIR FAMILIES WOULD BE BROKEN UP; DID YOU KNOW THAT? IS THAT YOUR IDEA OF COMPASSION? I DIDN'T INVENT SLAVERY, FANNY, BUT IT IS OUR WAY OF LIFE DOWN HERE, AND AS SUCH, I MANAGE IT AS HONORABLY AS I CAN; YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. HOW CAN YOU ACCEPT A MOTHER OF TEN WHIPPED FOR NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN YOU IN YOUR LUXURY? TELL ME THAT! IT ISYOURLUXURY TOO, SPEAKING OF HYPOCRISY. OUR SLAVES HAVE A HOME, FOOD, SAFETY, AND HONEST WORK. LEAVE THEM BE-- FOR THEIR SAKE. I HAVE TO INSPECT OUR PLANTATIONS UP RIVER. I'LL BE AWAY FOR SEVERAL DAYS. YOU ALWAYS FIND A REASON TO BE AWAY, PIERCE. SOMETIMES I WATCH YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, FANNY. IT IS THE ONLY TIME I CAN ADORE YOU WITHOUT HAVING MY SENTIMENTS HURLED BACK IN MY FACE. THAT IS WHY I FIND REASONS TO BE AWAY. ( chickens clucking ) ( people coughing ) ( baby crying ) OPEN UP THE WINDOWS. OPEN UP THE WINDOWS AND LET IN THE LIGHT. YES'M. OH. LET THAT ALONE, MISS. WHAT FOR YOU LIFT WOOD? YOU GOT NIGGERS ENOUGH TO DO THAT FOR YA. I'VE GOT ARMS AND I'VE GOT HANDS AND I CAN USE THEM. NOW, YOU OPEN UP SOME OF THE WINDOWS. DO AS I SAY. YES, MA'AM. THIS FLOOR NEEDS SWEEPING. ALL THIS RUBBISH AND FILTH MUST BE REMOVED. YES'M. AND THE CHICKENS; WE MUST TRY AND KEEP THIS CLEAN. PSYCHE, JACK. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY BLANKETS THAT AREN'T BEING USED AND PUT THEM UNDER THE PATIENTS THAT HAVE NONE. AND BE CAREFUL WITH THEM. YES'M. ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO SWEEP? YES'M. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, YOU CAN HELP US TO CLEAN THE FLOOR. AND SOMEONE GET SOME FRESH WATER. Woman: YES, MISS. Jack: PUT IT OVER THERE. JACK, BRING ME THE POULTICE. THANK YOU. THIS MIGHT FEEL COLD. ( inhales sharply; sighs ) THAT FEEL ANY BETTER? YES'M...IT SURE DO. I'M GOING INTO TOWN TOMORROW. I'M GOING TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME SEE YOU ABOUT... YOUR OTHER PROBLEMS. OH, NO, DON'T DO THAT. AUNT JERUSALEM CLEANED ME UP REAL GOOD. I'M MUCH BETTER NOW, TRULY I AM. WHY... WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN, HARRIET? MASSA BE REAL PLEASED YOU GIVE HIM MORE LITTLE NIGGERS, MISSUS. MY BABY MAYBE GROW UP TO BE A CARPENTER, WORTH MAYBE TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. MR. PARKER GIVE US TIME OFF FROM WORKING IN THE FIELDS. MORE CLOTHING, MORE FOOD IN THE HOUSE, TREAT US MUCH BETTER. AIN'T NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. THE FACT, HARRIET, IS THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN, IT'LL KILL YOU. YOU MUST TELL MR. PARKER THAT YOU WON'T. I'LL DO THAT. I POSITIVELY WILL. AND THERE'LL BE NO MORE FLOGGINGS IF ANYONE COMES TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS. YOU'D DON'T NEED TO BE AFRAID OF BEING WHIPPED ANYMORE. ANDNO ONEIS TO BE FORCED INTO HAVING ANY MORE BABIES, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES'M. Fanny: DO YOU HAVE A LARGE TUB? NOW, YOU RUB THIS SOAPY CLOTH ALL OVER YOU, EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE THIS. IT DOESN'T HURT. HMM? NOW YOU TRY IT. HMM? OH! DOESN'T THAT FEEL GOOD? AND WHEN YOU'RE ALL NICE AND CLEAN ALL OVER, THEN YOU POUR NICE, CLEAN WATER, WASH OFF ALL THE SOAP. ( squealing, laughing ) DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT BY YOURSELF? YEAH. DO YOU ALL THINK SO? I'LL TELL YOU, ANY CHILD THAT COMES TO ME WITH A CLEAN FACE AND CLEAN HANDS WILL RECEIVE A PENNY, ALL RIGHT? YOU SPREAD THE WORD. A PENNY. A PENNY, YES. ( laughs ) I WANT TO HAVE A WOOD FLOOR PUT IN, AND WINDOWS EVERYWHERE WITH GLASS IN THEM, MR. PARKER, WINDOWS THAT OPEN AND SHUT. AND NO ONE IS TO LIE ON THE FLOOR; SIMPLE BED FRAMES WILL DO. I DON'T DO NOTHIN' WITHOUT MR. BUTLER'S SAY-SO. DO I HAVE TO TELL MY HUSBAND THAT YOU STAND OUTSIDE MY WINDOW AT NIGHT TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ME, OR WILL MY SAY-SO DO? GOOD. I SHALL BE GOING INTO DARIEN THIS AFTERNOON FOR SUPPLIES. AND ONE MORE THING. I WANT YOU TO FREE JOSIAH FROM THAT HIDEOUS CONTRAPTION. TOO LATE. HE ALREADY RUN OFF AGAIN. THEN HE MUST BE SMARTER THAN YOUR CRUEL DEVICE. JACK. I AIN'TNEVERSEEN NOTHIN' LIKE THAT. I MEAN, YOU JUST TOLD HIM WHAT YOU GONNA DO RIGHT STRAIGHT OUT AND HE DIDN'T SAY NO! I MEAN, AIN'TNOBODYEVER TALKED TO MR. PARKER LIKE THAT. WE JUST LUCKY WE AIN'T DEAD, MISSUS, WE'RE JUST PLAIN LUCKY! AIN'T NO PLANTER'S WIFE IN ALL OF GEORGIA GONNA RIDE WITH A PASSEL OF NIGGERS WITHOUT A WHITE MAN ALONG! HA HA HA HA HA! ( knocking on door ) DR. HUSTON? I'M MRS. BUTLER. MISSUS GONNA BUILD UP THE INFIRMARY. SHE NEEDS BLANKETS, BANDAGES, AND MEDICINE AND ALL. AND I TOLD HER SHEGOTTO SEE DR. HUSTON, BECAUSE YOU FIXED UP A BONE FOR ME AT ST. SIMON'S. I REMEMBER IT WELL, JACK. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, MRS. BUTLER, I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU ALREADY. SLAVE NETWORK. IT'S MUCH FASTER THAN THE NEW TELEGRAPH. MORE COLORFUL, TOO. I WON'T ASK WHAT YOU HEARD. WELL, IT WASN'T ALL BAD, MRS. BUTLER. I HAVE MOST OF THESE MEDICAL ITEMS RIGHT HERE. AND IF YOU LIKE, I CAN HELP YOU GATHER THE LUMBER AND OTHER ITEMS ON THE LIST. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, DR. HUSTON. WELL, I'M GLAD I COULD AT LEAST HELP YOU WITH THE BUILDING MATERIALS. YOU CAN'T COME SEE HARRIET? NOT UNLESS YOUR HUSBAND OR MR. PARKER ASK ME TO. BUT SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR. MRS. BUTLER, WHY ARE YOU TAKING UP THEIR CAUSE? BECAUSE THEY'RE SUFFERING HORRIBLY. ONE GIRL'S HANDS AND FEET ARE LITERALLY ROTTING AWAY, SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN HAVE SOME KIND OF LOCKJAW, THEY'RE UNABLE EVEN TO SUCKLE. AND THERE'S PLEURISY EVERYWHERE. THE GIRL HAS A FORM OF LEPROSY TO WHICH NEGROES ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE, AND THERE'S NO KNOWN CURE. CHILDREN CONTRACT TETANUS BY PLAYING WITH INFECTED DOGS. AND PLEURISY? PARKER'S PROBABLY WORKING 'EM TOO HARD. HE'S FAMOUS FOR IT. NO, WHAT I MEANT, MRS. BUTLER, IS WHY ARE YOU, A WHITE WOMAN, A PLANTER'S WIFE AND AN ENGLISH ACTRESS, TAKING UP THE SLAVES' CAUSE IN GEORGIA? BECAUSE THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS. YOU MIGHT BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SAY THAT TO, MADAM. INCLUDING YOU? WELL, I HAVEN'T LYNCHED YOU. YET. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP, DR. HUSTON. I HOPE MY OPINIONS HAVEN'T OFFENDED YOU. I AM NEVER OFFENDED BY HONESTY....OR BY BEAUTY. PLEASE COME AGAIN. SOONER IS BETTER. YES, I WILL. Fanny:"HOW I WISH THAT INSTEAD OF MUSIC AND THEATER I HAD LEARNT SOMETHING OF MEDICINE. I OFTEN THINK IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR SONGS, THEY WOULD MURDER US ALL. BUT IT ISN'T ALL DREARY HERE. THE SUNSETS ARE GLORIOUS, THE DAYTIME SKY IS BRILLIANT, AND THE LOCAL FISH EXCELLENT. AND I MET A KIND MAN IN DARIEN, A DOCTOR, WHO AT LEAST LISTENED TO ME. HE MADE ME REALIZE HOW ALONE I AM HERE. AS FOR THE SLAVES, SOMETIMES I SENSE A PROFOUND SWEETNESS IN THEM. PIERCE IS RIGHT AGAIN-- I DON'T KNOW THEM AT ALL. I CANNOT FATHOM THEIR HEARTS." NO, SHE DOESN'T HELP US. ALREADY SHE HAS HAD HARRIET BEATEN. SOON ONE OF US WILL BE KILLED, YOU WILL SEE. SHE SURE ENOUGH HELPED ME, JOE, SHE GIVE ME MEDICINE. AND SHE CLEANED THE INFIRMARY ALMOST ON HER OWN. NO, SHE LIES. SHE SAY BLACK IS EQUAL LIKE WHITE. ALREADY WE ARE FIGHTING AMONG OURSELVES. SHE IS LIKE A PRETTY BUTTERFLY-- FIRST RAINY DAY SHE GONNA FLOAT AWAY, GONE, WE'LL STILL BE HERE. THAT'S RIGHT. I AIN'T GIVIN' HER ALL MY HOPES. YOU AIN'T SPENT TIME WITH HER, AUNT JERUSALEM. SHE AIN'T LIKE THE OTHERS. SHE MAKE YOU HER FRIEND. THEN MASSA BUTLER GET ANGRY, SELL YOU AWAY. I LOSE YOU, CHILDREN LOSE YOU. DON'T BE HER FRIEND, PSYCHE. DON'T. ( hammer pounding nails) NO, MR. PARKER, I SAIDTWOMORE WINDOWS. LIGHT IS GOOD FOR HEALING, AND IT WON'T WEAKEN THE STRUCTURE, RIGHT, SAM? UH, YES'M. I CAN FRAME UP THE SIDES OF EACH WINDOW REAL GOOD. BE STRONGER THAN BEFORE. TELL ME HONESTLY. ISN'T THERE SOME PART OF YOU THAT KNOWS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS A GOOD THING? WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR HUSBAND? IS THIS YOUR DOING? IS IT?! MUST I CONFINE YOU TO THE HOUSE? I FORBID YOU TO GO TO THE SLAVE CAMP ANYMORE, AND THIS RENOVATION OF THE INFIRMARY WILL STOP. BUT WHY? A HEALTHY SLAVE IS A WORKING SLAVE. GET MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY FROM YOUR PROPERTY. DON'T MOCK ME, FANNY. THREE SLAVES HAVE DIED IN THAT HELLISH PIT SINCE WE ARRIVED. TO GIVE THE SICK MINIMUM CARE DOESN'T SEEM TOO MUCH TO ASK. WHY DIDN'T YOU CONSULT ME FIRST? YOU ARE MYWIFE. BEHAVE LIKE ONE, OR I'LL PACK YOU OFF ON THE NEXT STEAMER HOME.ALONE. MAYBE SEPARATION FROM YOUR CHILDREN WILL RESTORE YOUR SENSE OF MARITAL OBLIGATION. MY GOD, YOU WOULDN'T DARE. IF YOU FORCE ME, I WILL, I ASSURE YOU. I WILL NO LONGER VISIT THE SLAVE CAMP IF YOU WISH... BUT PLEASE LET ME RESTORE THE INFIRMARY. IT'LL ONLY HELP YOU. PLEASE, PIERCE. ( angry shouting ) Parker: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?! GET BACK TO THE CAMP,NOW! NOW. JOE. JOE... GO HOME. JOE,PLEASE...GO HOME. PLEASE. WHAT'S HAPPENED? PATROLLERS CAUGHT JOSIAH DOWN BY THE LANDING. GUESS HE WASN'T AS SMART AS YOU THOUGHT HE WAS. NO! ( gunshot ) AAAH! GO BACK! GET OUT OF HERE! OH, MY GOD! THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO. NO LAWS WERE BROKEN, HE WAS A RUNAWAY AND FAIR GAME. HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT FAIR GAME FOR MURDER. THEY ARE IN GEORGIA, MRS. BUTLER. AND UNLESS YOU LEARN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DISPASSIONATE, YOU MAY END UP IN THE FLAMES YOURSELF. ( exhales ) YOU'RE RIGHT, OF COURSE. I SOMETIMES DOUBT THAT ANYONE WHO FEELS THINGS AS INTENSELY AS I DO COULD BE SAID TO FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL. WHY'D YOU COME TO SEE ME? I DON'T KNOW. LAST TIME YOU LISTENED TO ME, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH ME. HMM. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T HOLD THAT AGAINST ME. THERE'S A LOVELY POND NEARBY. I'D LOVE TO SHOW IT TO YOU. STILL WATERS...IT'S GOOD FOR RESTORING THE SOUL. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN, I STARTED READING BYRON. IT HAD SUCH AN EFFECT ON ME I HAD TO LIMIT MY READING TO EVERY OTHER DAY, UNTIL FINALLY I HAD TO STOP ALTOGTHER. IN RETURN, I HAD HOPED THAT GOD WOULD MAKE ME COMPLETELY AND PERMANENTLY GOOD. I'M STILL AWAITING THE CONVERSION. ( chuckles ) IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL HERE. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE EVER BROUGHT HERE. DO YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND, DR. HUSTON? I MET HIM A NUMBER OF TIMES. I LIKED HIM. DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE HERE-- WITH ME? HE LEFT FOR SAVANNAH THIS MORNING. IT'S A GREAT MYSTERY TO ME WHY HE EVER MARRIED ME. HE KNEW WHO I WAS; I'M NOT AT ALL SUBTLE. AND IF HE EXPECTED OBEDIENCE, WHY WOULD HE CHOOSE ME? WELL, IF YOU EXPECTED FREEDOM, WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE HIM? BUT THEN IF YOU HADN'T, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE, AND MY LIFE WOULD NOT BE NEARLY SO BRIGHT. AND THE BUTLER ISLAND SLAVES, THEY'D STILL BE PLUNGED IN DARKNESS. TEACH THEM TO READ, MRS. BUTLER. WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU SUPPORTED SLAVERY. NO. WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SUREYOU WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE. ( knock on door ) MAY I COME IN? YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, MISSUS. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT JOSIAH? HIM AND JOE WORKED AT THE WOOD SHOP TOGETHER. THEY WAS LIKE BROTHERS-- MORE THAN THAT. I'M VERY SORRY. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DO FOR YOU, FOR ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO TEACH YOU READING AND WRITING. I KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL, BUT I'M CALLING IT A BIBLE CLASS. MR. PARKER HAS RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO THE IDEA. IT'LL BE AT SIX O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY EVENINGS AT THE OLD BARN. JOE, I COULD TEACH YOU NUMBERS, IT WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR CARPENTRY. IS SOMETHING WRONG? WHAT USE SLAVES GOT KNOWING HOW TO READ AND WRITE? WE AIN'T GOT NO PLACE IN THIS WORLD. SLAVERY WON'T LAST FOREVER, PSYCHE. IF YOU CAN READ AND WRITE, YOU CAN HELP FREEDOM COME ALONG EVEN FASTER AND NOT BE HELPLESS WHEN IT DOES COME. YOU GOT ALL THE SLAVE CHILDREN WASHED; WILL THAT KEEP THE BELLS OFF THEIR HEAD? WELL, NO, OF COURSE NOT. JOSIAH... HE WANT FREEDOM. AND NOW HE FREE, IN ONE WAY. YOU WANT TO MAKE ME BETTER CARPENTER, BUT I STILL BE SLAVE. YOU SAY KEEP BABIES CLEAN, KEEP HOUSE CLEAN, BUT WE STILL SLAVES. YOU KEEP YOUR BABIES CLEAN. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. THEY GOT PATH TO HEAVEN, WE'S IN HELL. WE STAYPUT. GO BACK TO YOUR BIG HOUSE. IT'S BETTER FOR YOU. DON'T HELP US NO MORE. SHE TREAT US... SHE TREAT US LIKE... WE IN A PIT, SHE DANGLE THE ROPE THAT WE CANNOT REACH, TEMPTING US LIKE THE DEVIL. WE CANNOT HAVE FREEDOM. SHE MAKE ME FEEL LESS THAN A MAN. SHE CANNEVERKNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A SLAVE. NO, SHE CAN'T... BUT I THINK MISSUS IS DIFFERENT. I THINK SHE MEAN TO HELP. I THINK...MAYBE SHE BE GOD'S ANGEL SENT TO HELP US. MAYBE IT'S TIME...TO REACH, JOE. MY SWEET JOE. ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR YOU, AND ONE FOR YOU. YOU ALL DID A WONDERFUL JOB. YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL. ♪♪ ( flute ) THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. I MISS YOU, FANNY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO FIND YOU. COMING HERE DIDN'T HELP. WHEN WE GET BACK TO PHILADELPHIA, I WANNA BUY A FINE HOUSE FOR US-- CLOSE TO THE THEATERS, CLOSE TO YOUR FRIENDS. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL, PIERCE. WHEN WOULD WE LEAVE? RIGHT AWAY. MALARIA IS A SERIOUS DANGER HERE IN THE SUMMER. IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO STAY, IN ANY CASE. PIERCE, I CAN'T GO NOW. OWEN WILL FINISH THE INFIRMARY, I PROMISE YOU. IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I CAN'T LEAVE THE SLAVES. THEY DON'T NEED YOU. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW ABOUT YOUR LITTLE BIBLE CLASSES? EDUCATION DESTROYS THEIR HAPPINESS, FANNY. YOU MUST SEE THAT. WHAT I SEE IS THEIR HAPPINESS IS BASED ON IGNORANCE. NO! YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO THEY ARE! THEY ARE A SIMPLE, CONTENTED PEOPLE! THEY WILL NEVER BE OUR EQUAL! YET YOU EXTEND YOURSELF TO THEM MORE THAN TO ME! WHY?! I NEED YOU, FANNY! THEY DON'T! WHAT YOU NEED, PIERCE, IS TO RULE ME. I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT. DO YOU PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN I, MORE ENLIGHTENED, MORE INTELLECTUAL? YOU ARE MY WIFE. THE BIBLE CALLS UPON WIVES TO SUBMIT TO THEIR HUSBANDS, JUST AS IT CONDEMNS THE SONS OF HAM TO SLAVERY. OR DO YOUR SACRED OPINIONS NOW SUPERSEDE THE WORD OF GOD?! OH, WHEN DID YOU LAST READ THE BIBLE? I MISS YOU, TOO, PIERCE... BUT THE MAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH IS NOT THE MAN I MARRIED. YOU SET THE RULES OF COURTSHIP, FANNY. YOU HELP UP A RED CAPE TO MEN, DARING THEM TO CHARGE. IF I WAS THE BULL YOU COULDN'T IMPALE, I CAN'T BE BLAMED. BUT I HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN. IF YOU WOULD ONLY SEE IT. I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU... NOT THAT IT MATTERS A GOD DAMN. LOVE DOESN'T DEMAND OBEDIENCE, PIERCE. YOU'RE NOT MY MASTER. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU RESTRICT ME, THAT TRUTH WILL ALWAYS REMAIN. YOU'VE CAST ME AS THE VILLAIN, FANNY. SO I WILL PLAY THE PART. YOU AND THE CHILDREN WILL GO TO PHILADELPHIA WHEN I SAY... AND YOU WILL STOP WRITING LETTERS TO ELIZABETH SEDGWICK IMMEDIATELY! AND DON'T GO INTO DARIEN ALONE ANYMORE. DON'T DO IT, FANNY. NOT IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE. AND HIS. ( knock at door ) I WANT YOU TO KEEP MY JOURNAL FOR ME, PSYCHE. YOU TRUST A NIGGER WITH THIS? NO, I TRUST YOU WITH IT. ♪♪ ( people clapping and cheering ) ( children laughing ) WHAT IS THIS, MA'AM? IT'S THE ANNUAL SLAVE BALL. THE INFIRMARY LOOKS WONDERFUL. IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT, SAM. IT REALLY DOES. I'D LIKE TO HAVE TWO MORE DOORS IN CASE OF FIRE, ONE ON EACH SIDE. BE BETTER ONE BIG ONE ON THE FRONT AND ONE IN BACK, MISSUS, AWAY FROM THE FIREPLACES AND STOVES. YOU DO AS YOUR TOLD, DAMN YOU! YES, MASSA. YOU ARE THEIR MISTRESS. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ACT LIKE IT! I AM NO MORE THEIR MISTRESS THAN THEY ARE MINE. YOUR OWNERSHIP OF THEM IS A PERVERSION! AND I WILL NOT SUPPORT IT JUST BECAUSE I AM YOUR WIFE! ( all gasp ) ( groans ) ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISSUS? ( sighs ) YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. HUMILIATING YOUR HUSBAND IN FRONT OF HIS SLAVES IS AN INVITATION TO MURDER. IT WOULD APPEAR YOU FORGOT TO BE DISPASSIONATE. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO NOW? I DON'T KNOW. PIERCE AND I CAN NEVER RECONCILE. AND I SERIOUSLY DOUBT MY ABILITY TO ALTER THE SLAVE'S CIRCUMSTANCES. PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. YOU WOULD LEAVE PIERCE? IF YOU DID, FANNY, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE ALONE. GO BACK TO BUTLER ISLAND. MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR HUSBAND. AS FOR THE SLAVES... THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO, IF YOU'RE READY TO STOP PLAYING THE DILETTANTE. AND I THINK YOU ARE. HERE. YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT. AND SO AM I. ( carriage approaching ) ( sighs ) PIERCE, I... IT WAS UNCONSCIONABLE OF ME TO SAY WHAT I SAID. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. AND FORGIVE ME FOR STRIKING YOU, FANNY. I'VE SPENT ALL NIGHT THINKING I MIGHT NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN. All: C-O-T-T-O-N. COTTON. THAT'S VERY GOOD. NOW, YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR NEXT WEEK WILL BE TO MAKE UP A SHORT SENTENCE AND COPY OUT ALL THE WORDS. THAT WILL BE ALL FOR TONIGHT. All: THANK YOU. PSYCHE, JOE, WOULD YOU STAY A MOMENT? DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD? I--I HEARD SOMETHIN'. DIDN'T PAY IT TOO MUCH MIND. IT'S A WAY TO ESCAPE SLAVERY, TO GET AWAY FROM THIS PLANTATION, TO START A NEW LIFE, TO BE FREE. FREE? WE SET ONE FOOT OFF BUTLER'S ISLAND, THEM PATROLLERS WILL GET US, JUST LIKE THEY DID JOSIAH. NO, THIS IS NOT RUNNING OFF, PSYCHE. AND IT'S NOT A REAL RAILROAD EITHER. THERE ARE SECRET ROUTES WHICH YOU TRAVEL AT NIGHT AND STATIONS ALONG THE WAY WHERE PEOPLE WILL HIDE YOU AND FEED YOU AND GET YOU SAFELY TO THE NEXT STATION, ALL THE WAY TO OHIO OR CANADA. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT HELP SLAVES? I DON'T BELIEVE. OH, THERE ARE PEOPLE, JOE... BLACK AND WHITE, BAPTIST AND QUAKER, EX-SLAVES, RICH AND POOR, TRULY. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS? DR. HUSTON. HE'S BEEN A CONDUCTOR ON THE RAILROAD FOR YEARS. THERE'S A TRAIN LEAVING ON MONDAY NIGHT FROM OUTSIDE OF DARIEN. IF YOU WANT TO GO, I CAN HELP YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. THE LIMIT IS TEN, SO FIVE OTHERS CAN GO, TOO. I'VE DONE MANY THINGS WRONG TRYING TO HELP, AND THIS IS A RISK, BUT HUNDREDS OF SLAVES HAVE ESCAPED THIS WAY AND I THINK... I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CHANCE. HIDE 'EM IN FAN'S CRIB. MASSA WON'T LOOK FOR 'EM THERE. ( sighs ) BRING 'EM ON IN, QUICKLY NOW. COME ON, LET'S GO. HURRY UP. HURRY UP, COME ON. COME ON, HURRY UP. COME ON. GET IN THE BARN. HURRY UP. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON, GET INSIDE, QUICKLY. ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN. I'M HELEN. THIS IS SHADRACH. HE'LL BE DRIVING THE PACKAGES TO GRANGERVILLE TONIGHT IN HIS WAGON. YOU'RE NOT SLAVES ANYMORE. YOU ARE FREE MEN. HOLD THAT THOUGHT IN YOUR HEART AND GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST. NOW, IT'S A LONG RIDE, SO IF YOU WANNA HAVE SOME WATER, YOU BETTER, THEN LOAD UP. THIS IS MY FRIEND, ELIZABETH SEDGWICK'S ADDRESS. SHE'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I AM. WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU'RE SAFE, PSYCHE. PROMISE? I PROMISE, MISS BUTLER. AND I SWEAR, UNTIL I FORGET GOD AND MY VERY OWN SELF, I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, OR THE KINDNESS YOU'VE GIVEN. I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU. YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR WORDS. IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO SEE YOU GO... JUST WHEN I'VE COME TO LOVE YOU BOTH. ( pounding on door ) Man: OPEN UP IN THERE! OH! HIDE! HIDE! COME HERE! GO TO THE HAY! QUICKLY! LIE DOWN! LIE DOWN IN THE HAY! Man: OPEN UP IN THERE! IT'S ALL RIGHT. SHH. WELL, EVENIN', GENTLEMEN. WHAT CAN I DO FOR Y'ALL? UM, UH, WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR RUNAWAYS. ( chuckles ) AIN'T NO RUNAWAYS HERE 'CEPT ME AND, UH, I'M KINDA BUSY AT THE MOMENT. MIND LEAVIN' US BE? ( laughs ) Man: I THINK SHE LIKED YOU. ALL CLEAR. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. COME ON. HOW'D YOU DO THAT, MISSUS? I WAS AN ACTRESS. AND A GOOD ONE. Helen: EVERYONE IN THE WAGON. HURRY UP. IT'S BEHIND THE BARN. QUICKLY! QUICKLY! NO, I WANNA GO BACK WITH YOU, MISSUS! YOU MUST GO, JACK! YOU'LL BE SAFE, I PROMISE! > NO! THERE IS NO TIME FOR THIS! THEY MAY BE BACK SOON! NO! I AIN'T GOIN'! I AIN'T GOIN'! Fanny: GO! PSYCHE, JOE, GO! PLEASE! COME ON! COME ON! STAY DOWN! H'YAH! H'YAH! H'YAH! WHOA THERE! YOU SEEN ANY FUGITIVE SLAVES RUNNIN' TONIGHT, SIR? RUMOR IS A BUNCH OF 'EM ESCAPED NEAR HERE. I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE, GENTLEMEN. YOU MIND IF I LOOK UNDER YOUR TARP, SIR? Man: THERE'S ONE! THERE HE GOES! STOP, NIGGER! ( gunshot ) ( groans ) DIDN'T KNOW THAT NIGGER WAS BACK THERE. TOO MANY DAMN RUNAWAYS THESE DAYS. ONE LESS NOW. SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU, SIR. H'YAH! LET ME TAKE YOU ALL THE WAY BACK. NO, YOU MIGHT BE SEEN. GOOD-BYE, DR. HUSTON. TEN SLAVES ESCAPED LAST NIGHT. ONE WAS KILLED. NO OTHER PLANTATION IN GEORGIA TREATS ITS SLAVES BETTER. IS THIS HOW YOU REPAY ME?! THEN I WILL REPAY YOU IN KIND! ONE OF YOU WILL RECEIVE 100 LASHES FOR ALL OF YA! BRUTUS! ( all scream ) NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! MAMA? NO! NO! NO! MOVE 'EM BACK! NO! GET BACK! ( grunts ) GOD. ( screams ) YOU WILL WITNESS EVERY SINGLE LASH! ( screams ) TELL ME, FANNY, DID YOU FREE THEM FOR THEIR SAKE OR TO HURT ME? TELL ME THE TRUTH. ( screams ) NO!

Man: THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. ALL: BYE. WHOA. I PLEADED WITH PIERCE TO GIVE ME A SEPARATION, TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND TO SUPPORT MYSELF BY RETURNING TO THE STAGE. HE'S OF COURSE REFUSED. SAYS MY MIND IS DISEASED. PERHAPS WE SHOULD NOT STAY HERE WITH YOU, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. OH, FANNY, DO SIT. YOU'RE MAKING ME ILL. HAVE SOME OOLONG TEA. PLEASE? ( sighs ) AS TO SEPARATIONS AND OTHER MAJOR LIFE DECISIONS, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME? AND OF COURSE YOU'LL STAY HERE. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PSYCHE AND JOE? YOU'VE ASKED ME THAT TWICE. THE ANSWER'S STILL NO. FANNY, I KNOW OF MANY MARRIAGES BETWEEN INCOMPATIBLE PEOPLE WHERE THEY HAVE FOUND A SENSE OF HARMONY. DON'T GIVE UP. YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION OF PIERCE AFTER READING THIS. THEY'RE LETTERS I WROTE BUT NEVER SENT. ONE OF THE MAJOR ROUTES OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD GOES UP THE DELAWARE RIVER. MAYBE THEY CAME THAT WAY. DO YOU PICK UP YOUR MAIL OR DOES MARIA? SHE--SHE MAY HAVE MISPLACED A LETTER. NO, SHE DIDN'T. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT, FANNY? WHO ARE WE GOING TO SEE? ( dog barks ) ( both gasp ) DAPHNE ALEXANDER. DR. HUSTON TOLD ME SHE WAS A CONDUCTOR ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. THIS IS A WAREHOUSE. DAPHNE? THAT'S ME. I'M MRS. FANNY-- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'S THAT WHITE WOMAN GOT OWEN STIFF NECK PARKER TO PUT DOWN A WOOD FLOOR IN THE BUTLER ISLAND INFIRMARY. YOU'S FAMOUS ON THE RAILROAD, HONEY. WASN'T YOU A ACTRESS OR SOMETHING SILLY LIKE THAT BEFORE? WELL, YES, I WAS-- I WAS A BUTLER ISLAND SLAVE MYSELF ONCE. GOT OUT BEFORE THERE EVEN WAS THE RAILROAD. WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE. COME ON IN, COME ON. ALL RIGHT NOW, COME ON OVER HERE. NOW YOU SEE WHERE YOUR MAMA IS? GO SEE YOUR MAMA. GO AHEAD. YES, MA'AM. ( sighs ) UM, YOU KNOW WHO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON IS? YES, HE WAS THE-- WHO YOU ANYWAY? THIS IS MY DEAR FRIEND ELIZABETH SEDGWICK. OH. WELL, AIN'T NO WHITE MAN EVER BEEN A BETTER CHAMPION OF THE NEGRO THAN WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. AND HE STOOD RIGHT WHERE YOU STANDIN'. AND HE CONGRATULATED ME ON MY WORK. NOW, WHY YOU TWO STANDIN' HERE? I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT REMEMBER MEETING A COUPLE. PSYCHE AND JOE AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN? PSYCHE? NO. NO, I REMEMBER ALMOST EVERY NAME, BUT AIN'T NO PSYCHE COME THROUGH HERE. DR. HUSTON TOLD ME ABOUT-- HE TELL YOU THAT PRO-SLAVE DEVILS SET FIRE TO OUR STATION? TWO LITTLE GIRLS GOT BURNED ALIVE-- MAKE IT MURDER! BUT THE LAW DON'T MEAN NOTHIN' 'CEPT LAWS AGAINST THE FUGITIVE SLAVES. NOW ALL WE GOT IS THIS PLACE. IT RAINS, WE GOT WATER UP TO OUR ANKLES. I'M SORRY. SORRY I COULDN'T HELP YA. CAN... CAN I HELP IN SOME WAY? WELL, AIN'T MANY PATRICIANS LIKE YOU WANT TO HELP. I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST THAT. I DON'T KNOW. ( laughs ) OF COURSE YOU CAN HELP, HONEY! THAT'S WHY YOU'VE COME! ( laughs ) COME ON, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU WHITE LADIES AROUND. OH, PIERCE WON'T PUT UP WITH THIS, FANNY. HE WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. OH, REALLY? AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT? HARMONY. YOUR PHRASE. I'LL BE MORE OBEDIENT AND AGREEABLE, THE WIFE HE WANTS ME TO BE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE GOING TO DECEIVE HIM INTO THINKING THAT ALL IS WELL WHILE YOU COMMIT MATRIMONIAL HERESY BEHIND HIS BACK? I'M AN ACTRESS. HE'LL NEVER KNOW. YOU HATED ACTING, FANNY, BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUTHFUL. THIS IS A LIE THAT WOULD WOUND PIERCE TERRIBLY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED, ELIZABETH. YES, I DO. I READ YOUR JOURNAL. CAN'T STAY WITH ELIZABETH FOREVER. AND SINCE YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR HOW MUCH YOU DESPISE BUTLER PLACE, WE'LL HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'LL START LOOKING FOR A HOUSE TO RENT IF YOU LIKE. YOU WON'T HAVE TIME FOR IT, I'M SURE. THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT. THE PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY'S ASKED ME TO DO THEATRICAL READINGS FOR VARIOUS HOSPITALS, FOR CHARITY. THEY WOULD MOSTLY BE IN THE EVENINGS. READINGS? NO, FANNY. I WON'T HAVE MY WIFE DISPLAYING HERSELF IN PUBLIC SHOW, CHARITY OR NOT. IT IS UNSEEMLY AND ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY. I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE. I'LL POLITELY DECLINE. YOU, UH, MIGHT WANT TO TAKE THIS. IT COULD RAIN. THEATRICAL READINGS? I NEED TO TELL HIM WHERE I'LL BE AT NIGHT. BUT HE SAID NO. WELL, HE HASN'T HAD ANY REASON TO SAY YES, YET. YOU ARE SHAMELESS. FANNY? ( moans ) YOUR JUICE, SIR. WHY DON'T I TAKE THE DAY OFF ON FRIDAY? WE COULD HAVE A PICNIC ON HORSEBACK. THE GIRLS, TOO. SOUNDS LOVELY. I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THOSE READINGS YOU WANTED TO DO. YOU SAY THEY'RE FOR CHARITY? MM. THEN WHY DON'T YOU DO THEM. I DON'T SEE THE HARM. AND IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU. THEN I WILL. THANK YOU, PIERCE, VERY MUCH. ( baby crying ) GIVE ME ANOTHER SHEET. ALL RIGHT. ( crying continues ) YOU SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX A BROKE ARM? DID YOU THINK I ONLY KNOW HOW TO POUR TEA? OH, AIN'T WE GOT SOME CHEEK. ( chuckles ) WE CAN'T BE IN THIS WATER HOLE COME WINTER. THESE BRAVE SOULS NEED AN ISLAND OF COMFORT ON THEIR DANGEROUS JOURNEY, NOT A ANTE-ROOM OF HELL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I WANNA SEE THE UPSTAIRS. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE THIS. YOU'VE DONE IT, FANNY. YOU'VE MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO CHANGE. THIS IS THE LEAST I CAN DO. I KNOW YOU GET HOMESICK FOR ENGLAND. BUT WE CAN BRING ENGLAND HERE. YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FRIENDS, EVERYONE. WE CAN HAVE BALLS, GRAND DINNERS, EVERYTHING, RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN HOME. AND YOU HAVE A WRITING ROOM WITH A VIEW OF THE WHOLE CITY. I LOVE YOU, FANNY. I'VE NEVER STOPPED. THERE ARE 11 ROOMS, 8 WITH FIREPLACES, AND PLENTY OF BEDS. THE KITCHEN'S WELL-EQUIPPED. WE'RE FOUR MILES FROM THE RIVER, BUT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT SAFER AS A STATION, ESPECIALLY FOR FUGITIVES WHO ARE SICK AND NEED TIME TO RECOVER. THERE ARE NO OTHER HOUSES FOR MILES AND NO ONE EVER COMES BY HERE. IT'S PERFECT! PRAISE THE LORD! AND YOU, TOO, HONEY. WOULD YOU JUST WAIT JUST A MINUTE? WHAT IF PIERCE COMES HERE TO VISIT? I MEAN, THIS IS HIS CHILDHOOD HOME. HE WON'T. HE'S TOTALLY CONSUMED WITH THE NEW HOUSE. BESIDES, I TOLD HIM I HATED IT HERE. ( baby cooing ) WILL YOU TAKE HIM TO HIS MOTHER? DO YOU FEEL MORE WILL COME? OH, THEY'LL COME, MISS BUTLER, MORE AND MORE EVERY WEEK. DON'T YOU WORRY, THEY'LL COME. MISS BUTLER? MISS BUTLER! IS THAT YOU, MISS BUTLER?! OH, YOU GOT OUT? YES'M, I DID. THANKS TO YOU. THAT DAY WHEN I FELT YOUR ARMS COME 'ROUND ME, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOD HISSELF. TRULY I DID. AND 100 LASHES KILLS A MAN. I OWE MY LIFE TO YOU, MISS BUTLER. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. HOW DID YOU GET OUT? DID DR. HUSTON HELP YOU? HE DID, MISSUS. AFTER YOU LEFT, HE GOT A LOT OF SLAVES OUT FOR 50 MILES 'ROUND. BUT THE OWNERS... I GUESS THE FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM. THEY SHOT HIM IN HIS BED. HE HAD 32 BULLET HOLES IN HIM. HE WAS POWERFUL FOND OF YOU, MISS BUTLER. HE SAID SO. I'M AWFUL SORRY ABOUT IT. ( crying ) YOUNG MAN, YOU BEST HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT. COME ON. I'M SORRY. OH, GOD! ( continues crying ) "THAT VERY TIME I SAW BUT THOU COULDST NOT, FLYING BETWEEN THE COLD MOON AND THE EARTH, CUPID, ALL ARMED. A CERTAIN AIM HE TOOK AT A FAIR VESTAL THRONED BY THE WEST--" IS CUPID REAL, MOTHER? IF HE SHOOTS YOU, YOU'LL SWEAR HE IS. PAPA! HELLO, SUGAR. MWA. I'M GOING TO BE AN ACTRESS, PAPA. I DIDN'T SAY A WORD. WELL, ACTRESSES HAVE TO WORK AT NIGHT, SARAH, AND I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE TO SLEEP. IN FACT, I WAS ASLEEP WHEN YOUR MOTHER CAME HOME LAST NIGHT. DID THE READING GO ON THAT LONG? NO, IT DIDN'T, BUT COMING HOME TOOK FOREVER. THE AXLE ON THE CAB BROKE. SO WE HAD TO WALK ABOUT HALF A MILE, MOSTLY THROUGH MUD, TILL WE CAME TO A FARMHOUSE WHERE WE HAD TO WAKE THE OWNER AND HE BROUGHT US HOME IN A BUCKBOARD. I HAD TO DO HALF THE READING AGAIN JUST FOR HIM. ( chuckles ) I LOVE YOU, FANNY. AND I THINK SARAH WOULD MAKE A LOVELY ACTRESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE KNOWS OR SUSPECTS. YOU HAVE TO SUSPEND YOUR ACTIVITIES FOR A WHILE, FANNY, REALLY. I'LL GO IN YOUR PLACE. I WILL AFTER TONIGHT. HE'S IN NEW YORK. HERE. WHAT HAPPENED? THE WAGON WAS ATTACKED NOT FAR FROM HERE. SCHOOLBOYS WITH KNIVES AND BUCKSHOT. THEY KILLED THE CONDUCTOR AND WOUNDED A WHOLE BUNCH ELSE. ( groans ) DAMN PRO-SLAVERS. MAY THEY ALL BURN IN HELL! RIDER COMIN'! PIERCE! WHAT IS THIS? GET THESE GOD DAMN NIGGERS OUT OF HERE! THEY'LL BE GONE IN THE MORNING. SOME OF THEM ARE WOUNDED AND NEED CARE. ( grunts ) THIS IS MY HOUSE! YOU GET OUT! I ORDER YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE! THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, BUT YOU OWE THEM A GOOD NIGHT'S REST AT THE VERY LEAST. NO ONE'S LEAVING. ( all gasp ) DOES HE HAVE A RIFLE OUT THERE? OH, MY GOD, HE'S GONNA BURN US OUT! COME ON! ELIZABETH, DAPHNE, GET EVERYONE OUT! THE INJURED, GET THEM OUT! ( grunting ) COME ON NOW! COME ON! GET EVERYONE! ELIZABETH, HURRY! WE GOTTA COME THIS WAY! ( all talking ) YOU GOTTA COME THIS WAY! ( all talking ) WE CAN'T GET OUT THAT WAY! WE GOTTA FIND A WINDOW! OVER THERE, COME ON! ( all scream ) GET INSIDE QUICKLY! HELP ME! EVERYONE MOVE BACK! MOVE BACK! ( grunts ) QUICK, EVERYONE! GET OUT! GET OUT! CAREFUL. ( grunts ) COME ON! ( grunts ) GET OUT! COME ON, GET 'EM OUT, QUICK! ( all screaming ) COME ON, THERE YOU GO. COME ON, THAT'S IT. COME ON. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. GO THAT WAY. COME ON! GO HOME. GET YOUR CHILDREN BEFORE HE DOES. WE'LL BE OKAY. TAKE HER WITH YOU, ELIZABETH! GO! GO! YOU GET OUT OF HERE! COME ON, GET TO THE WAGON! YOU GET OUT OF HERE! YOU GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! COME ON, COME ON! GET OUT! ( door opens ) GET THE CHILDREN DOWN HERE. I WANT THEM TO SEE THEIR MOTHER AS SHE REALLY IS. THEY'RE WITH ELIZABETH. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THEM AND FOR US. ALWAYS WHAT YOU DECIDE, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, FANNY? THIS HOUSE MEANS NOTHING TO YOU, DOES IT? WAS IT EASY TO MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU CARED FOR ME? DID YOU AND ELIZABETH HAVE A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT IT? NO. IT WAS A DECEPTION AT FIRST, BUT THEN I SAW THE MAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH... THE MAN I STILL LOVE. OH, MY GOD, HAVE YOU NO SHAME? YOU WOULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT, PIERCE, WITHOUT ME, WITHOUT YOUR SLAVES. YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD MAN. MARRIAGE HAS TURNED YOU AGAINST YOUR NATURE. WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US? ME, ELIZABETH, AND THE OTHERS. THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD HELP THE FUGITIVES. IT WOULD BRING US TOGETHER AND IT WOULD LIFT SUCH A WEIGHT FROM YOUR SOUL. YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOU COULD FLY. ( chuckles ) OH, YOU ARE MARVELOUS, FANNY. I ALMOST BELIEVED YOU... AGAIN. NO, I WON'T HELP YOUR BELOVED NIGGERS. SORRY, YOUR FUGITIVE FREEMEN. IN FACT, YOU WON'T EITHER, EVER AGAIN! YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM OR ANY ABOLITIONIST OR ANTI-SLAVERY DEMAGOGUE! IF YOU DO, YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR CHILDREN AGAIN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?! PIERCE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. AND YOU WILL STAY AWAY FROM ELIZABETH SEDGWICK! I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT I CANNOT STOP HELPING THOSE PEOPLE. WON'T HURT YOU, NO ONE HAS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT I'M-- I SAID NO! YOUR INSOLENT DEFIANCE SICKENS ME! YOU MADE ME BURN DOWN MY HOUSE! AND WHY? YOU LOVE NIGGERS MORE THAN ME! NO, PIERCE, NO! I LOVE JUSTICE! AND I LOVE YOU. LIAR! YOU ARE A DEMON! GO BACK TO HELL WHERE YOU CAME FROM! YOU HAVE DESTROYED MY HAPPINESS! Fanny:"DEAR ELIZABETH, I AM FOREVER INDEBTED TO YOU FOR SUGGESTING I TAKE A COTTAGE HERE IN THE BERKSHIRES. I SPEND WHOLE AFTERNOONS TENDING MY GARDENS OR WRITING LENGTHY LETTERS TO SARAH AND FAN. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT THEM. BUT HUMAN BEINGS ARE ABLE TO ADJUST TO ANY PRIVATION, HOWEVER PAINFUL. MR. FURNESS, BLESS HIS HEART, HAS ACQUIRED A FINAL DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AFTER FIVE LONG YEARS. PERHAPS BECAUSE PIERCE HAS SPENT ALL OF HIS MONEY AND I'VE ASKED FOR NONE. HE EVEN HAD TO AUCTION OFF HIS SLAVES. BUT I CAN SEE MY GIRLS AGAIN AT LAST. I WILL BE IN PHILADELPHIA ON FRIDAY TO SIGN THE PAPERS." PIERCE IS NOT COMING? HE'S ILL, BUT HE SIGNED. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTERS TWO DAYS EACH MONTH AND TWO MONTHS IN THE SUMMER. BUT HE STILL INSISTS THAT YOU NOT PUBLISH YOUR GEORGIA JOURNALS. HE SEEMED FIXED ON THAT POINT. OTHER THAN THAT, THE AGREEMENT SEEMS GENEROUS ENOUGH. WHEN DO I SEE MY GIRLS? AH, WELL, NOW, THAT, UM... THAT WAS A THORNY PROBLEM. BUT FINALLY IN THE END, I PREVAILED. MAMA. IT'S MAMA. OH! OH, SARAH, FAN! I MISSED YOU BOTH SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU, MAMA. OH, AND I LOVE YOU, TOO. AH! HAVE YOU READ THIS? READ WHAT? IT'S PREPOSTEROUS. WHAT? WAIT UNTIL YOU READ IT, MRS. SEDGWICK. IT IS VERY TERRIBLE. PARLIAMENT IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A LOAN TO THE CONFEDERACY. ARE THE COMPLETELY MAD, WITH A WAR BETWEEN THE STATES ALMOST INEVITABLE? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I AM GOING TO MY PUBLISHER. FANNY, NO! YOU CAN'T PUBLISH YOUR JOURNAL. PIERCE WILL CUT OFF YOUR VISITATION RIGHTS. PEOPLE WILL WANT TO KILL YOU IN THE STREETS. OH, WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT, FANNY, STOP IT. I AM SERIOUS. NOW THINK ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS. I HAVE. PARLIAMENT HAS NO IDEA WHAT THIS WAR COULD MEAN. THEY'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THEIR SUPPLY OF SOUTHERN COTTON. TO THEM, THE EVILS OF SLAVERY ARE INSIGNIFICANT. I CANNOT JUST STAND BY. "MRS. BUTLER, WHO GLOWED ON THE STAGE IN HER PREVIOUS CAREER, NOW TARNISHES HER REPUTATION WITH HER GEORGIA JOURNAL, AN OUTRAGEOUS FALSIFICATION OF SLAVERY." ( sighs ) GUESS WHO WROTE THIS ONE. "ARE WE TO LET OURSELVES BE INFLUENCED BY THE TRIVIAL MUSINGS OF AN EX-PATRIOT, AN ACTRESS TO BOOT, ON MATTERS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE?" PARLIAMENT, OF COURSE. BLOODY BLIND FOOLS. IT IS IMPORTANT. THERE'S NO DARKER HUMAN IMPULSE THAN TO DENY ANOTHER HIS FREEDOM. IT'S DEGRADING AND DEBASED EXISTENCE. THIS LOAN WILL ONLY PROLONG THE MISERY OF IT. ARE PEOPLE GONNA KILL YOU IN THE STREETS? THEY WON'T, MY DARLING. BUT I HAD TO DO THIS. WE CANNOT ALWAYS HIDE IN THE SHADOWS WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG. THAT MAKES US PART OF THE ERROR. IT'S A MESSAGE FROM PIERCE. HE WANTS TO SEE YOU. ( sighs ) PIERCE? IT'S FANNY. MAY I COME IN? PIERCE? FANNY. PLEASE, COME IN. WHAT A SURPRISE. I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. I'M SORRY YOU'RE SEEING THE HOUSE LIKE THIS. I'M FURNISHING AND PAINTING UPSTAIRS. I'VE BEEN SO BUSY LATELY. PLEASE SIT DOWN. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR SETTLING OUR DIFFERENCES, PIERCE. AND FOR TAKING SUCH GOOD CARE OF SARAH AND FAN. THEY'RE QUITE GROWN UP. GIVE THE CREDIT TO THEIR BOARDING SCHOOL, NOT TO ME. PIERCE, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO TELL YOU. I KNOW MY REBELLIOUS EMOTIONS CONTRIBUTED ENORMOUSLY TO OUR DIFFICULTIES. AN EFFORT TO COMPROMISE NOW AND THEN WOULD NOT HAVE HARMED ME. I'M TRULY SORRY FOR ALL THE MISERY IT'S CAUSED YOU. AT THE AUCTION, A VERY OLD SLAVE CAME UP TO ME. HIS NAME WAS CUDJO. I'D FORGOTTEN I EVEN OWNED HIM. HE TOOK MY HAND. NO SLAVE HAD EVER TOUCHED ME BEFORE. HE SMILED. AND HE SAID, "YOU IS FREE NOW, MASSA, YOU IS FREE." I READ YOUR GEORGIA JOURNAL. I KEPT THINKING, WHO IS THIS CRUEL, UNFORGIVING MAN? AND IT WAS I. ( crying ) MOMMY, MRS. SEDGWICK'S HERE. FANNY! ELIZABETH! OH, YOU LEFT TOO SOON. PARLIAMENT CANCELED THE LOAN TO THE CONFEDERACY. THEY READ EXTRACTS FROM YOUR JOURNAL IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. EVEN THE QUEEN READ IT. OH, YOU DID IT, FANNY! YOU REALLY DID IT! THE TRUTH CHANGED THEIR MINDS, ELIZABETH, NOT I. FANNY, YOU MAY HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THE SOUTH WILL NEVER EQUAL THE NORTH'S CAPACITY TO PRODUCE ARMS AND AMMUNITION. YOUR JOURNAL MAY END UP HELPING TO PRESERVE THE UNION, AND END SLAVERY. YOU SHOULD BE PLEASED, FANNY. YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HELP. AND NOW YOU HAVE... SIGNIFICANTLY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE MET WITH THE MAYOR OF YOUR TOWN WHO HAS REQUESTED THAT I NOT READ THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR. I'VE BEEN MET BY THE CLERGYMAN OF YOUR TOWN WHO HAS ALSO REQUESTED THAT I NOT READ THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR. I'VE BEEN MET BY THE SCHOOLTEACHERS OF YOUR TOWN. THEY, TOO, HAVE UNANIMOUSLY REQUESTED THAT I NOT READ THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF PRESENTING TO YOU TODAY SHAKESPEARE'S IMMORTAL COMEDY THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR. ( applause ) OH, THEY ADORED YOU, ABSOLUTELY. YOU WERE MARVELOUS. AND I MAKE BUSHELS OF MONEY, MOST OF WHICH I GIVE TO DAPHNE TO KEEP UP HER GOOD WORK. MOMMY, LOOK. SARAH, FETCH ME A CROWBAR AND HAMMER. WHAT ON EARTH COULD THIS BE? EXCUSE ME, GIRLS. ( grunting ) WHO SENT IT, MAMA? IT'S FROM JOE. HE MADE THIS. PSYCHE WROTE ME A LETTER. "DEAR MRS. BUTLER, WE MADE IT TO KINGSTON, CANADA. WE HEARD ABOUT BUTLER STATION WAS BURNED. WE HEARD YOU MOVED TO LENNOX. WE WILL VISIT WHEN IT IS SAFE TO TRAVEL. JOE MAKE THIS FOR YOU. HE SAY IT IS FOR MANY MORE WORDS YOU WILL WRITE. WE ALL THANK YOU. WE CAN ALL READ AND WRITE. JOE LEARNED NUMBERS. YOU OPENED THE WINDOWS AND LET IN THE LIGHT. YOU SAW OUR SOULS, NOT OUR SKIN. WE ARE FREE INSIDE OUR HEARTS. AND THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE, ALWAYS, FOREVER. WE LOVE YOU. PSYCHE, JOE, MAYSIE, ESTHER, AND RACHEL." ( chuckles ) ( indistinct chatter )
