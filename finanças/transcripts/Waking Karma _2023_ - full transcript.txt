Do not do Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday" to JFK. I'll die. -Okay, but I'm only sparing you because it's your birthday. -Thank you. -That's "Thank you, Mister President," to you. -No! -At least you had the decency to pretend to be asleep. -What do you mean? -Don't play innocent. You can't lie to me. Now, make a wish, and don't tell me what it is, no matter what I threaten you with. -Hot. -Cute. Ugh! Please tell me you'll throw that out. -I will if you tell me what you wished for. -You told me not to. -Hm. Then look where it's going... into my bag to show all my friends. -Yeah, well, luckily, I know you don't have any besides me. -Um, what do you think you're doing, young lady? -Eating breakfast before dessert, like a normal human being. -That is a violation of at least three birthday laws. I insist that you eat every last crumb of your birthday cake, and then let me make you some of that disgusting vegetarian bacon you claim is edible. -I'll tell you what I wished for. -Deal. Honey, you're doing that thing. What's up? -Uh, nothing. Yeah. It's stupid. -Nothing you want is stupid. Tell me. I've been thinking about changing my last name to Jones. Officially. -Uh, yeah. Listen. You can change your name if you want. But there's a reason I gave you his. -To guarantee I never date until my 40s? -To make sure that neither of us forgets. I mean, no matter what the paperwork says... Believe me. I have been trying for years, and you can't erase him that easily. He doesn't just go away. And it's... safer not to pretend that he has. Anything else you want to tell me? -Mm, no. -This came yesterday... It's a great school. And I know you've been checking online every five minutes. I don't understand why you didn't tell me. -It's on the East Coast. -We'll make it work. I can always get an apartment near campus. I am kidding. Now go get your bathing suit on. -Mom. I have school. -Uh, birthday statute 435. "Thou shalt not attendeth school on thy birthday." -Where's the rule against bossing around the birthday girl? -That one guy's bathing suit should have counted as a sex crime. -There is no excuse to wear a Speedo in the 21st century. -No, you can't-- you can't have a Speedo and a mustache. One is the legal limit. -Hey, wait, where do you think you're going, missy? -To bed. -But it's still your birthday for... 39 more minutes. I'll--I'll brew us a pot of extra strong coffee, we can stay up late, watch a scary movie, eat candy until we feel sick? -Mom, I already feel sick from eating cake for breakfast and three veggie dogs for lunch. -Until we feel more sick? -I have school in the morning, okay? I don't want to be tired. And don't you have to work? -I actually sell more houses when I'm half asleep. It makes me a better liar. -I'm gonna go to bed, all right? You--I'll close my door so you can watch whatever you want by yourself. Good night, Mom! -Mom? Are you okay? -This came for me today. Without a stamp. -"She has been prioritizing the plush monkey all her life. "I will teach her to choose wire. It's time. I am coming for her." I don't get it. -It's from him. -How? "I'm coming for her?" -You. He means you. -Okay. Um... we'll call the police. It'll be fine. -No. No, you don't know him. The cops won't do any good. They'll make things worse. -Well then, what? -Pack a bag. I know a place we can go. Please don't tell me you forgot to renew triple A. -I don't want to talk about it. -Why'd you even open it? -I don't know. Better to do something than nothing. -Can we get an Uber there? -Nah, it's too far. We could hitchhike. -Mom! That's like a guaranteed way to get murdered. Absolutely not. -Your generation is so fragile. -Maybe yours wasn't fragile enough. -Hey! Quick! Get in. -Don't you think you should maybe, like, I don't know, tell me some stuff? -Stuff? -You know what I mean. -Honestly, I don't. -About him. -I've seen your search history. You've seen every article ever written about him. What more do you want to know? -What happened to you. - No. - No? That's it? Mom. It feels like I'm going in blind here and it might help to actually, like, know-- -It won't. What you don't know is the only thing keeping you calm and sane right now, I promise. - Sunny. - Hi. Hey, look at you, huh? And that must be Karma. -Hmm. Yeah. -Oh, yeah. Hugs. -Karma, this is Butch. I'd really hate to see how you say hello to someone you don't like. -Ah, yeah. Sorry about that. Didn't--didn't mean to give you a start. But, you know, you can't be too careful, right? - Hm. - Especially now. So, uh, why don't we go inside and let Priscilla feed you some breakfast? That'll make her happy. I'll get the gate. -Did you see something...? -What? No. I'm sure it was just the wind. Or that big head of yours making up stuff like it sometimes does. -Sorry, little lady. We prefer to stay off the grid here. You know those things are homing beacons, right? Lead somebody right to you. -He's right. -So you guys don't have Wi-Fi? -Not even dial-up. So, come on. Let's eat. After you. After you. -Hi. -Ah, Karma, this is my wife, Priscilla. And you remember Sunny. Well, sit, sit. We're not formal here. Mm, hope you like your bacon crisp. I prefer mine chewy, but I'm happy to defer to the majority on special occasions. Karma, are you a vegetarian? -Vegan. Sorry, we should have told you. -No, no. Nonsense. We'll keep that warm in the oven and Priscilla will whip you up one of her delicious soy protein shakes. -No, no, I--I'm not even hungry. -No, it's no trouble. Really. I'll get some strawberries from the garden. She'll like those. Hm. -Does she not talk? -Hasn't in years. -What happened to her? -Sometimes when you stay quiet for too long, it sticks. I'm going to go check on that shake. Hey, Priscilla, let me help you with that. Sorry. That was a whole drama with Butch and the garden. You would not believe how much dirt goes into this whole fruit and vegetable thing. Make sure you finish the whole thing. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, or at least that's what they say. -It tastes weird. -So, how's the shake? -Delicious. - I told you. Sunny, you'll have the works, right? - Yes, please. - There you go. So, Karma, your mom tells me that you got into some really fine schools. You must be very excited about next year. -I'm sorry, but can we talk about what's actually going on here for a minute? -Karma. Don't be rude. -No. It's... it's quite all right. But nothing's going on. You're safe here. That fence outside? It's impenetrable. The gate we have chained and padlocked. There are motion sensors all around the edges, so we're gonna know if anybody gets too close for comfort. The only way anybody gets in is if I let them in. And that's not going to happen. -I just wish you guys would stop acting like everything's okay. -Old habits die hard, I guess. -I'm not feeling very well. May I please be excused? -Of course. You want to lie down in our room, you're more than welcome to. - No, that's okay. -Thank you, darling. -Was it true what you said to her? About how safe it is here? -Yeah. There are no cell phone towers, no data, no cloud. No one out there even knows we're here. And Paul? Where is he? -Well, the authorities were last tracking him in Oaxaca, Mexico. -But somebody dropped that note at our place. -He could've paid anybody to do that. Not necessarily a believer. -How many do you think he still has? Well, Wendell's never left his side. A big, quiet man always shows up in the reports. I don't need to tell you-- I mean, Paul is basically the Pied Piper of lost souls. He can get anyone to follow him through fire and not ask for water on the other side. But that far in in Mexico. I thought he was sticking closer to TJ. -Well, a few too many girls disappeared. He had to move on. -Yeah. In some ways, I'm sure Mexico is perfect for him. Remember when all those factory women turned up missing a few years back? -Yeah. Well, as long as you're poor and brown, no one seems to care. -I'm sorry if I scared you last night. That's part of why I don't like talking about your father. I don't want to give you fear that isn't yours. -It's okay. I just wish you wouldn't treat me like a child. -Honey, you are a child. It's my job to treat you like one. -I'm the same age now as you were when you had me. -Believe me, I was a child then, too. -Do you trust him? -Who? -Butch. -Absolutely. With my life. -Mom, I think there was something in that shake. I don't feel right. -No, I'm sure it's just nerves. Look, Butch went to an awful lot of trouble to make sure he didn't have to hurt people anymore. He's not going to start again now. -That's comforting. -Maybe you should lie down, like he said. Come. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Ssshhhh. I'll be right outside if you need anything, okay? -The scorpion fly represents reincarnation. The larvae appear to die before they're reborn as adult flies who then give birth to new larvae, beginning the cycle all over again. - I'm--I'm--I'm so sorry. I-- - You were scared. And wondering if I was the embodiment of everything you are running from. I don't blame you. -What are these? That--that mask, I-- -They're reminders of why I left. I keep these in case I'm ever tempted to go back. This is our daughter, Cindy, the night she died. -What happened? -A failed reincarnation. I'm surprised your mother hasn't told you about them. -No. She won't tell me any of it. It's like it never happened. Is that why you left? -Yeah. And why I sold out every friend I had to try and send your father to prison. Instead, I loosed him on Mexico, and guaranteed my wife and I would live running from our shadows for the rest of our days. There is some beauty in it. The promise of a life never ends. The end to the fear of death. And in my experience, the more we resist the inevitable, the more we bring it on. -I need--I need some air. -Well, we got plenty of that. I'll go with you. -No, no. I'd rather be alone. I'll--I'll be fine. Honestly. Hello? Is anyone in there? Mom! -Priscilla? Where are you? Priscilla! Priscilla! Darling, we got to go. All right? I need you to go start the car. I'm going to go get weapons from the shed and then find Karma and Sunny. Listen to me, it's going to be all right, I promise. It's probably just a squirrel again, but just in case, I need you to move. Come on. Let's go. Wendell. How the fuck did you get in? Hey. Take me. Just leave Priscilla. She doesn't know anything. She never talked. She can't talk. Please. I'm the one you want. -You are a rat. Rats don't kneel. They run. Run. Run! -Mom? Ah! Hello! Is anybody out there? -Hey. You can come out. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. Mom! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. -Oh. Don't tell me you never made it to the car? Where are the keys? Give me the keys. Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry, my love, I'm sorry. But I do need you to stand up. Now. Now. Listen to me. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. But we have to go. Let's go. Hello, Karma. -I know you're not real. You're not real. -You're a lot shorter than I thought you'd be. But, uh, you know, you're... every bit as weak. That figures, you know, considering how your mother is. -Fuck you. Where--where is she? -There you go. You're catching up. There you go... uh, she's where she should be. -You're not real. You're not real. -Oh, yes I am. You're seeing things, you see, because you're very, very close to divinity. I'm curious: Are you a virgin? -What? What...? -Do boys want to touch you? When even like probably not if they find out who your father is, right? Maybe they get off on it. -That's disgusting. -I'm guessing virgin. I'm guessing you're a virgin, yeah. You don't smell like a slut. I can smell one of them from across the room. -What do you want from me? Why am--why are you here? -What do I want from you? You know, I believe in choice. Free choice, okay? You know what that is, right? I want you to kill a mouse. All you gotta do is... do this, put his little head in there... It's over. Dead. -I don't kill animals. Did you know that Hitler was a vegetarian? It's easy. Trust me. Or... You know, you could die here and then he'll eat you. You want to be eaten by a mouse? -So why don't you just kill me right now and get it over with? -You really think I would just kill you, huh? You're my daughter, Karma. What kind of a monster do you think I am? -I'd rather die. -Hello, rats. -Here you go. Oh! What do you say? -Please. -Please what? -Sir. -Good job. Congratulations. -Mm, looky there. Look what we got here. You know, you're all the same, aren't you? Just all full of your own desires. Slaves to your physical needs. That's the most important thing, right? I should've had a son. -Wendell! -Where do you think you're going? You can let go of her now. You know, next time you do that, you're gonna get shot. All right? You can go, Wendell. What are you so serious about? You know I'm just joking around, right? That shaking thing. It means I'm getting to you. It's a really bad habit. You ever hear of a, uh... Harry Harlow? Ring a bell? No? And they let you into Harvard, huh? You know what he did? He got a bunch of monkeys, and he took their mother away from them. And then he gave them a choice of mom: one made out of wire, to feed them. Or a nice, you know, soft, nice, cozy, comfortable, gentle mother to watch them starve. Which one do you think they picked, huh? 'Cause I'm trying to find out: Are you a real girl? Or a fucking monkey? Which one are you? You a fucking monkey? You don't like that, do you? Which one do you think they picked, huh? - Um. The cold...cold wire mom? -The wire. Ooh. No. Of course they picked the nice, soft, cozy, warm, comfortable mother to watch them starve. Listen...you can leave if you want. You can go run away. It's open. Go ahead, take it. Go ahead. Ooh. Except for one thing. Uh, your mom is staying here. -No. No. I won't leave her. -Oh yeah, you will. Yeah, yeah, you are. Yeah. -No. No. No, I'm not leaving without my mom. -You got about five minutes to make up your mind because Wendell's gonna come back out to check on me, so here. - Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fucking Sunny. - Roadside assistance. A little trouble with your starter there? That's because I told Wendell to disengage it, 'cause you ain't going nowhere. Mom! Another weak monkey moment, ladies and gentlemen. -Mom? It's me. Can you talk? Priscilla! Are you okay? Do you know where my mom is? Where's my mom? -Can I give you a word of advice? -Shhh. - I've spent a lot of time with your father. And at this point, struggling can only make things worse. He wants to break your spirit. It's not personal. It's not about violence. This is just what he does. He wants to crawl inside your head and make you just as cruel as he is. -You said no one was getting in here unless you let them in. -I can promise you, it wasn't me. I'd rather die than help that man again. -Then who was it? -Where's my mom? -Well, good afternoon to you, too. She's right where she should be, all right? Ask stupid questions. -I'm vegan. -I don't really care one way or the other. -I'm not going to eat it. -Yes, you are. -Or what? -Or what? Well, I tell you, um, you're never gonna see your mother again. How about that? -So if I eat this, I can see my mom? -What's so wonderful about mothers? If you tell me what's so goddamned important about a mother, that might help. -You must have had one. -Your grandma was a real peach of a woman. The--the fucking face that launched a thousand drunks. -Paul. Spare the girl. Why? What's so goddamned important about being a mother? I was thinking maybe we should ask, uh, Priscilla. She's a mom. She would know. Maybe she has some insight. -You know she doesn't speak. Please. -Yeah, well. Not many marriages can survive, you know, a daughter's throat being slit by the father. Right, Butch? -I mean, you don't even know what happened between these two, do you? -They told me you killed their daughter. Oh, that's a good one. -I never said he was the one who did it. -All right...so. The mute's crying now! Yes. -Paul, I deserve this, all right? Every second of it. But these two haven't done anything. Let them go. Let them go! Do whatever you want with me. -You--you really mean that? -Yes. Well, all right. -Argh! God! I decide what you deserve. -Eat your food. Or I won't take the knife out. - Karma, you don't have to do anything you don't want to. You don't have to. Eat your food. -Eat your meat. Eat it. Eat it all! -That's a good girl. Ah! -Now you're worse than me. -Worse than you? You know, I was your age when I killed my mother. She was the first one. Yeah. But at least I didn't eat her. -Where's my mom? -Well. There she is, right there. Oh, Jesus. Well, I promised you if you ate, you'd see her again. Wendell. Get rid of these two. Mom. -You're a very good girl. Stay here. Come on. Stand up. Here. You know, um... I'm very proud of you. What you did at lunchtime. You earned the right of choice. These two? I'll fucking kill them both right now. I'll stab them to death. But you earned the right to decide. You kill one of them or I'll do them both. -Karma. Karma, I'm begging you. Kill me, leave Priscilla. Let Priscilla live. Baby... please. -Come on. Good girl. You could actually save a life. Kill me! Please, Karma. -Do it! The time is now. Butch or Priscilla, which one? Who you gonna do? -Let them both go. You're gonna stab yourself, is that it? Yeah, you know how hard that is to do? You're not even going to get through your T-shirt, all right? Let's give Butch a really good show. What do you think? Huh? All right. -No!! No. You know, when I was a kid, I really didn't get fed enough. My mother didn't really feed me good. So, one day I took a stick. I was so fucking hungry that I killed a rat. With a stick. And I ate it. That's how, you know, hungry I was. See, and there's a rat, right there. You know what it's like to have a rat in your life? You know, who wants that? Right? That's not good for Papa. Is it? A rat, on a stick. Open up your mouth, rat. Open up! -Fuck you. - Mom? - Mom? - Open up your mouth! -I thought you were dead. He told me that you... Are you okay? Where were you? Mom! Mom! Mom! What's going on? What? Is he making you do this? -Nothing. No, no, of course not. -So you just decided to come out and save his life instead of mine? -I believe in the power of choice, honey. -That's something he thinks; that's not something you think. -We think the same things. -Since when?! -Let's talk about this later, okay? You're tired and you don't know what you're saying. -I thought we were best friends, Mom. -Of course we are. But this is the highest honor I could hope for for you, Karma. -What are you talking about? How--how is this an honor? Did he drug you? Mom? -Hey, listen. You know what? This woman right here has never wavered against me, never went away from me, for 17 years. You know, she gave birth to you, you know, to save her own skin, but nevertheless, she did do that. -The path is clear, Karma. The soul may reject the vessel, but not if she's a perfect genetic match. A daughter. -You bred me for him? You fucking bitch. You don't deserve to live! Wendell! - Ah! Ah! No! No! No! Mom, please. Mom. Mom! -Honey, we have great news for you. Should I tell her, or do you want to? -Uh, you go ahead. -You passed. Yay! It was touch and go there for a while with your attachment to me, but you came through at the end and you really stuck the landing. -Yeah, you sure did. I'm proud of you, Karma. -Fuck you, you fucking psychopath. -You see? I told you she had spirit. -Well, I mean, you were right, but she also had a lot of bad habits, and sometimes you have to break somebody's spirit to get rid of bad habits, and that's what we did, so... -So can I leave now? -Even better. You might not like the sound of this at first, but I promise you, it's going to be amazing. -Karma, you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives together, starting tonight. -What? -I mean, there's really no higher honor. I would have offered to do it myself, but I wouldn't be a genetic match. -But I thought if I survived then... -Oh, no, no. This was never about survival. It was about getting you ready. -Ready for what? -You have to break the spirit of the host before the new soul enters the body. -And in your case, honey, we had to prepare you for a level of brutality that you were used to rejecting so you could match up with your dad. -Mom. This makes no sense. Please tell me you hear that. -I know it's unfamiliar. But it's the simplest thing. You're going to be the host for the soul of the greatest prophet the world has ever known: your father. Congratulations. - Wendell! - No, no, no, no, no, no! Let me go! Let me go! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? -Let's get you cleaned up, okay? Everything will look brighter then. Shhhh. Good girl, baby girl. Good girl. -Oh, good. You're awake. We have a ton to get through before nightfall. -Mom, what are you doing? What--what's going on? -My first question for you is, are you on your period? -Why? What is this for? -Are you menstruating, yes or no? We need to be quick here. -No. No, don't you remember when I took your last tampon two weeks ago? -I do. But these are for your father. -Why does he need to know if I'm having my period? -I'd appreciate if you would pee in here and let me see the toilet paper, just to be sure. -Absolutely not. -I know this all seems strange but, believe me, it's in your own best interest to cooperate. -If I pee for you, will you answer a question for me? As my mom? -Fine. -You're clean. -Mom? What did he have to do to you to convince you to do this to me? -Nothing. I'd do anything for him. And it's not "to" you. It's for you. -You wouldn't do anything for me? -It's different. Is it possible that you're not menstruating because you're pregnant? -I'm sorry? -Just answer the question. -Mom, you know the answer to that. -I need to hear you to say it. -No. It's not possible I'm pregnant. -Are you a virgin? -Where were you for the last three years of high school while I cried to you that I couldn't get a date because everyone thought I was weird? -I'll take that as a yes. Are you a lesbian? -What does it matter? -Yes or no? -No. I like boys, they just don't like me. -I'll need you to submit to a virginity test. -Are you-- are you fucking kidding me? Mom, you know those tests are bullshit. -Your father requires it. -Wendell, would you come in here, please? I need your help with something. No, no, no, no. Mom, no! No, Mom! No! You can't do this. Mom, this isn't you. No! No! -That plush monkey you grew up with, who you thought you knew? That wasn't me. I told her to you as a bedtime story so you could fall asleep at night. -No. -But now it's time to wake up and grow up. - Please. -This is the real me, whether you like her or not. -Everything looks good. We'll give you a second. -Get up. You've had long enough. I said, get up. -Put these on. -No. -Suit yourself. -I need you to dig. Here. -How deep? -At least six feet. -So it's a grave. -Get digging. The sun will be going down soon. - Is it for me? -That depends entirely on how the ritual goes. -So, if it fails... -If the soul rejects the vessel, then the vessel is corrupt, and we must... we must dispose of it. -And what happens to you? -All I know is that if you don't do exactly what I say and do it now, I'm going to lose both you and your father in one night. -Mom, have any of these rituals ever worked? -This one is different. His power, your genetic match, the presence of the divine, everything we've sacrificed. This one will work if you do what I say. -So you're saying they've all failed? Mom. Mom, let's get out of here together right now, okay? Then I don't have to die, and neither does that fucking monster you think you love. -You don't know him. Now start shoveling. Physical exhaustion will purify the vessel. Shallow. But it'll have to do. Mom, I'm starving. -Hunger will purify the vessel. -I don't understand how you pretended. With me. -I was never pretending. -Did you meet him? Behind my back? -Never. He told me to wait. -And you waited. -I waited. -You thought about him, though. And never told me. He doesn't love you. -It doesn't matter. -But I do. -He gave me everything I have. But you? You took and you took, and you never gave any of it back. -Are you kidding? All I ever did was take care of you. You were never a real mom. Aaaahhh! -I wanted to do that a hundred times when you were a baby. I couldn't go through with it because I knew Paul would kill me. You stole my life. I never wanted you. I only had you because your father told me to. Is that what you wanted to hear, Karma? Because that's the truth. Wendell! We're done here. -You want her someplace else? -No, thank you. Could you give us some privacy, though? I have a present for you. Your father and I would like you to wear this. And then you can put the mask on and go out to the yard and we'll meet you there. You know, after everything he's done for you today, I think you could stand to lose the attitude. You're lucky to have a father who wanted you. Not everyone does, you know. And sometimes we have to sacrifice. You think it was easy for me to raise you alone with no money? I can tell you I didn't get it done by sitting around and crying about it. And sometimes we have to-- buck up and play the hand that fate dealt us. So even if you don't like it, you'll put on the dress when I tell you to. Because I am your mother. -No, you're not. You never were. Fine. Then do it so your father doesn't gut you like a fish. Is that enough motivation for you? Thank you, Wendell. Hello, Karma. You know, I've been a fucking monster. You know, it ain't no fun being an animal. It gets to the point where it just ain't fun no more... Paul? It's really you. Wendell. The soul has accepted the vessel. The vessel is holy. You'll need to bury the discarded shell. I believe it's still in the bathroom. -Oh, God, there's so much I want to ask you. What did it feel like? Did you touch divinity on the other side? You must be tired. But we have plenty of time to catch up now. Years and years... Have I told you how much I missed you? All those lonely nights... -What are you doing? Wendell! Get out here right away! The vessel is corrupt. -No! -We were wrong. The vessel is corrupt. -I saw him in her. The vessel is deceitful! No! No! No, let me go and take her. She's a lying little bitch who killed our prophet! -You want me to kill her? No. I'll do it. He'd kill me without blinking. And you know it. -You know you wouldn't have survived a quarter of what I went through. And you dare to think you're better than the greatest prophet who ever lived! To take him from me, you-- Shut up! -You take everything he gives you. You think you're so much smarter than he is, that it's your right to decide who lives and dies. -But you're worthless. You're a worthless piece of shit. Shut up, shut up, shut up! -You don't deserve the air you breathe-- - Shut up! -Yeah! Why should I? Because Paul died and made you queen?
