[Slum-girl accent] Could I change arms? What did you say, Sara? Wouldn't it be the same with the other 'and? Like this! Jus' for a little while... No, it's not just the same. But we can have a bit of a break. Yeah, thanks! It's 'ard doin' fings you ain't used to. No, you're used to rushing around. Yeah, I get all twisted up here. Do you like working hard? Yeah, dere's nothin' like workin' da land! How come you think that, being born in town? You'd understand, if you grew up in da gutter. When I come to Enskede... I started to long for the country and the birds. When Ma and Pa kicked it, I cleared off. Don't you have any family? Nope. All on me lonesome! I got an uncle in Australia, but I ain't 'eard tell of 'im in 15 years. - May I take a peek? - Sure you can. I guess I ain't qualified to 'ave an opinion, but... ...I sure ain't no beauty-queen. Does me kisser really look like dat? I best not show meself in church. There's no shame in a face perspiring from work. I'm saying that it's a little part of nature. That's what I'll call the painting. "A little part of nature" ? That's a scream! 'eck! Wouldn't da birds back 'ome piss demselves laughin'! That is, if they recognised me. It's not THAT unlike you, is it? No... I s'pose it ain't... ...too crappy. Best ya go on before ya lose da likeness completely. Do you think you could speak less crudely? We never say ''piss oneself'' or ''crappy'' and things like that. Maybe you think it's nice? Nah... not nice... Da gab jus' comes out wifout thinkin'. Well it's not nice to hear that "gab". Think about what you say. So let's continue. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Good morning. Off to an early start, I see. Is that one for the National Museum or the family collection? What's today like? What'll we wear? Sky-blue shirt, pearl-Grey tie, and a beige suit. Thanks. Where have you hidden her... ''the divine one''? Wotcha talkin' about? I'm talking about my shaving water. Can the divine one untwist herself? Just a sec.... Excuse me, Sir. Sorry to have to bother you. When I've got my shaving water, you can paint away all day. Am I first up, after Mr Bright-and-early? No, believe it or not. You look like a sleepwalker as well. It can't be good for you to get up before 9. No, it's not good. It's no fun, either. But once you're awake, then... There you are. Well, I shan't bother you any longer. Good luck with the masterpiece! George - if you happen to sell it, don't forget the 50 you owe me. If you get that much for it, of course! Lower your hand a bit. - Good morning, George. - Good morning, Monica. Aren't you at the Academy today? No, this is more interesting, just now. Sara, where are my shoes? Ya stompers are outside da door. I mean, my brown walking shoes. Oh, Dem! Excuse me, Sir.. Did you hear that? "Stompers"! She's hopeless! Give me a cigarette. But don't you think she's nice? And we won't get such a good worker for 35 kronor a month. Sure, she's nice. But the way she speaks! Thanks bro! No, it's not very nice. You're not very busy... You could take an hour a day to teach her how to speak properly. She's worth it. You want ME to do it? Teddy's an actor... He'd be better. I've got other things to do. I write nearly as well as you paint. 'ere are ya stompers, Miss. Dere ya are! Sara! Good morning, George. My tea, Sara. And don't forget the fruit salts Nah! ...wif 'ot water. 'ere's today's rag, if ya wanna look-see, Ma'am. Thank you. I suppose you're referring to reading the newspaper. Her crude language is getting on my nerves. Don't criticize my terrific model! We can't afford to get more expensive help any longer. Has something happened? No, just the usual... Living beyond our means. Now, if you had more sense, George.... Something wrong with my sense? Yes... from the whole family's point of view. So it's that again?! Let me be quite clear... I'm never ever going to allow myself to marry a bank account! Have you anything against Fanny, as a person? She has her qualities. Don't you fret, Mummy! When I'm finished with the Academy and had my first big showing... We'll see then. Monica will publish her first book and Teddy will be a big hit... Teddy slår igenom, då kommer pengarna. We'll be rolling in money! But how are we supposed to manage till then?? And Fanny is coming here today with her parents. I'm sure it won't hurt for you to be pleasant to her. That's alright. Fanny can't help being rich. That's her parents' fault. Fault? In that case I'm glad that I'm without faults... As goods as! As goods as?! Good enough to lend me 100 for a couple of days?? No, the money-lending days are over. At some stage you children's creative instincts might bear fruit. I'm sorry but our instincts came from you. Your fault... Mother of Creativity! You're playing the fool! But you're still sweet... silly-billy! Be right with you, Sir! I'll be blowed! Be right with you, Sir! Is she rich, that one? Miss Berg? Oh yes! She's good for a few hundred thousand. Hold on properly! Take this. And there'll be more. She's getting Berghamra estate. A few hundred thousand smackers!? Well of course she can scream. Though anyone else 'd be fined for disturbin' the peace. I pity the poor sod who's landed wif 'er! That'll probably be our George. Dat's crazy. I fink 'e's 'ot stuff! Yes, he may be a sweetie... But his father, Mr Haller, didn't leave all that much behind. So they're all hoping that George will grab her. Imagine havin' lotsa moolah! I can only presume that you mean money? I wish you would use words that people could understand. Are you gonna start naggin' 'bout da way I talk, too? So what would you do, if you had "MOOLAH"? I'd prob'ly try and beat dat rube to 'Ot Stuff! Hey, Hulda... Do you know what I'd do if I had a lot of money? I'd make myself available for Miss Monica. I can't believe that anyone could be so stupid! You are the only one I think of... You are the first love of my heart... I love you like no one else on earth I love you, I love you I love you for all eternity... I looooooooove..... ...you... What's the matter, Sara? -It's just dat I fought... What did you think? That would be extremely interesting to hear. I could tell she was screechin' all wrong. Nobody take any notice of what Sara thinks. Just attend to you duties. You can go now, Sara.. I'm very sorry... I'll deal with her. How can you keep someone like that? She seems so badly brought up... She sounds like a guttersnipe. It's time we went. - What did the lady say? - That they had to leave. I guess I'll get da boot. She wuz real bad. But you can't say that. - Dey asked wot I fought. - Even less reason to say! Best I go pack me bag... Calm down, now... we not there yet. Help me dry the dishes. "The hawk will always eat." Here are two tens.. That means a change of circumstances. It's doubtful which way it goes. It all seems a bit doubtful to me! Just wait and see. Here... Two aces and a 10. She can't stay here now, despite her being friendly and hard-working. No, she went too far. And it'll be nice to be rid of that Southerner slang. It doesn't bother me. How about you, George? I like Sara. She's always happy. '' The Divine One'' is becoming indispensable. Nobody's indispensable. Don't say that. Who else wants to be a model, chambermaid, and all-round helper? I think this discussion about Sara's good and bad points has gone on quite long enough. So who's going to tell her she's sacked? It's not my position to discharge a girl. No, up to now, they've always resigned! Will you get rid of her for me? She's never done me any harm. Well I suppose I'll have to do it. I have do everything unpleasant in this household. Nice that the radio's playing the right music for a family drama. Sara! Yes, Ma'am? Will you come here for a moment please? Yes, I'll be right there.. What did I tell you?! Where's my apron? Calm down now! It'll work out. Talk to her - and be polite! Is it really necessary to dismiss her? Necessary? How about a respite? This is so unpleasant. - Yes, we all like her. - We need to agree on this. WE? Heavens! Why does anyone ever have children?! Here is the evening news. Stockholm resident Sara Margareta Holm... ...is reported to be the sole heir to a million-kronor fortune... ...from the estate of the late Australian mine-owner, Victor Holm. Miss Holm, whose last known address was 47 Skane St, has still not been found. That must be our Sara! She mentioned she had an uncle in Australia. So what do we do now? What is it? It was nothing... just for now... I mean... you can go, Sara. We'll probably call you back. I've never felt so stupid. What are we going to do? You'll have fun. - What did they say? - Nuffing at all. Just dat I could go... and come back. Dey were all actin' a bit weird. Weird? Very weird! I bet they've changed their mind. Somebody has to tell her. I'm much too nervous to do it. I shouldn't be able to say a thing. I'll do it then. "I have do everything unpleasant in this household." Who could have dreamt of such a thing?! To inherit a million... I'd go through hell for that. Lucky you missed out then! People have died for less than that. Let's see what happens. Sa... That could have been tactless. Miss Holm! Please be so kind as to come in for a moment. D'you 'ear dat? "Miss Holm"! Dis is it ! They must want to be formal, if they're dismissing you. This is the "change of circumstances"! Shall I go out an' come back once more? It's not 'ard... Gimme me slip an' I'll be on me way! I fink I deserve a reference, too... ...if dat ain't too much bovver. Sit down, and I'll explain something to you. Don't be afraid... you won't be hurt. So, your name is Sara Margareta Holm? Yes. But some call me "Da Divine One" . I dunno why. Have you heard of Sarah Bernhardt, the actress? She was called "The Divine Sarah''. Don't write that on the reference... it'll look as though it's false. Why would that be? Teddy! You had something else to talk about. Your name is Sara Margareta Holm from 47 Skane St.? 2nd floor, right, rear. Do you have an uncle in Australia? Yes... Uncle Vic. 'e 'ad somefing to do wif "nickel" or somefing. So wot's it all about? Sara... that uncle of yours has died. Dat can't be MY fault? No... but we heard on the radio that' he'd left a fortune of a million... ...that's waiting for you to collect from the Foreign Affairs Department. Me? The now-most-divine of all Saras... Sara Holm. Congratulations! She went nuts! The poor little thing..! I'll go talk with her. You might have put it a little more nicely! More nicely? I thought I put it beautifully. Nothing to be sad about. Easy to say. If only it were us... Don't say that or I'll start crying! Don't you cry, Sara... You'll find yourself a new place. How is she? You can see, Ma'am... She was expecting it. But she so likes working here... Isn't there some way she could stay? Yes... please, Ma'am! Stay? That wouldn't work, Hulda. - Well, if one has no heart.... - What's heart got to do with it? Surely you can make an exception for her Ma'am... She's slaved day and night for all of you. Don't you know why Sara was crying? Yes... because she got the boot. Just listen to me a moment. Sara's uncle has died and left her a huge amount of money. What?! She got an inheritance?! Yes... I wanna stay 'ere like before. I don't want no money. What would I do wif it? I wouldn't know what anyone does wif a 'ole Lotta money. Sara, you can very easily learn to be rich. And oo'd teach me? Once, I could have... Perhaps Sara could stay... and take millionaire lessons. Don't fine families sometimes have something called "pain jests". "Paying guests", is what you mean. That's it! The poor girl's all alone in the world. Think of all the unscrupulous people who could take advantage of her. She could pay a good fee. O' course I'd pay real proper! - You understand...? - Yes, that's clear. Then the question of the sort of room to be in. I'll think about it, so you calm down, and it'll all work out for the best. Worst accidents than becoming filthy rich can happen to a person. I'd be happy with an accident like that. What do you think of your old fortune-teller now?! You're terrific, Hulda. ''A lot of money over the water'' the cards said. But I wasn't expecting it to happen so quickly. Now you're a rich lady. "Lady in waitin' " Yes, that's right! - Shall I take the tray? - Please, Anna. You made a boo-boo there! This game calls for brains! The cheeky so-and-so! Here's something to interest you, George. "Donations sought for old-age home for artists." Speaking of which, how are you going with your showing? Or have you lost interest? Why? You don't seem to be doing anything. I'm feeling down on inspiration and motivation. Why not paint me? I'd like to be recorded for posterity. A face like that's not worth recording! How about some scenes from nature? Like that island out there. It lay there smiling, idyllic,unadulterated, as our Lord created it. Then an idiot buys it... botches it with a modern villa. What's left of nature? Nothing! The smile has become a guffaw... The idyll has vanished. The same happened with my model. What was original, has been obliterated. The Nature that attracted me as an artist, no longer exists. Forgive me speaking my mind, Sara. Couldn't you start a new painting, with Sara in a different situation? It could never be a masterpiece. The motive would have no inspiration behind it. - Good night, Mrs Haller. - Already? As you wish, Sara. So how are you liking the book? There's just one word what I don't understand. What is a ''guentleman''? The right explanation would be a man... ...who is the direct opposite of our nice brother, Sara dear. Thank you... and goodnight. Ain't good manners more 'n jus' the way ya talk? I wanna be clear about dat! If not, I'll be quite 'appy goin' back to bein' a little part o' nature! Maybe I jus' need to be motive for a dauber! That's telling you! I lurve you.... I lurve you...! - But... what's this all about? - "A little part of nature". I was bein' silly last night... I'm sorry. I'm not so fine yet that I can control myself. Can't you finish that painting? I promise to look as idyllic as possible. Thanks, Sara, but things are different now. That "speaking my mind" last night... I expressed myself rather clumsily. It's my turn to say sorry. Look at it... There's no likeness at all. Look... Before, the face was hot, perspiring from work... the lips bare... and the nails... Don't say "dirty"! They weren't! No, but not painted, either. I think we'll leave this painting be. Maybe I'll finish it some day, without a model. Tell me... Could I ask something... just between you and me? You don't like me at all. Why say that? It's obvious. How? In every way. The others are all sweet to me, but you're like a freezer. What's so wrong with me? Nothing in particular. It's difficult to become a lady in 2 months I can see that. But don't start acting like a wuss! A lady doesn't say "wuss". - What's a lady say? - Nothing. She ignores a man whose behavior she dislikes. Ig...nore? Doesn't give a damn about him, in popular speech. Then I should... Thanks for the advice. Are you coming to the Bergs' today? No, I had a reluctant invitation. Anyway, I IGNORE that "rube"... in popular speech. - Goodbye, children. - Goodbye, Mum. I think it's shameful Teddy isn't coming. We're unwell! And we'd get worse, from that canary you're crazy about. You wrap it up now, George! Wrap up what? Aren't you off on the road to a proposal?! Bye, bye! Have fun! Tell me, Teddy... Do you think George likes that Berg girl? Not exactly... But we joke about how beneficial it would be, if he did. Sara... What shall you and I do now? Don't know. What say we get dressed up, and have a slap-up dinner? You've something to wear? Half a dozen outfits I haven't worn yet. Well wear one now! Hey, Hulda! What surprises do you have for dinner, Hulda? Mutton with cabbage. Could I ask for a little more imagination?! We want a banquet! Listen to me now...: Cocktails... then Russian caviar, eel, salmon, fois gras, creme Windsor with sherry... lobster with ice-cold Irroy... and spatchcock with Romanee 1904... ...parsnip or croustades... ...glass, fruit, cheese, coffee, Hennessy, Chartreuse, Havanas and Turkish delight. That sounds yummy! Where am I supposed to find all this? We have a pantry, don't we? And a wine cellar for special occasions? For regular folk, not for millionaires. Well, I'm no millionaire... I don't have 2 kronor. It's MY shout! It's time I had some fun. It's settled! I'll go order the stuff. Show us now how you worked at the palace. - Shall I help you? - With the caviar, anyway. Caviar? I've never seen a caviar. Hurry up, now! Let's get on top, top top... On top of a budding romance! But Sara... You really are divine! Only YOU would think that. Only me? What do you mean by that?! Your arm, Madame... You shall now make your entrance. Remember not to look joyful! You're bored with the world... Blase. Blase? - Or hungover. - I understand. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! Now you offer cocktails. A cocktail, lydies and chentlemen? Sara, it's pronounced "ladies and jentil-men". We'll have a cocktail, anyway. What's in this? Fox-bait?! Foxbait? What a good name for a cocktail! We'll have one more to mark that. Are we supposed to get sloshed? That's possible. But we'll certainly have more fun than those at the Bergs'!! I wonder what's keeping the butler. - Who? - The butler. Dinner is served. Yours, yours, yours will I be and become if you'll only be mine, mine, mine. The paradise road is crooked and long, but you shall see... ...the clouds above are never as heavenly as here... Where it is blue, blue, blue for ever and ever... Let's get on top, top top... On top of a budding romance! In every song and poem... you fall in love in spring A small exception I thought might be about now, if you understand me... Because it's now autumn, shouldn't we listen to that voice within us? Let's get on top, top top... On top of a budding romance! Come, come, come with me and don't blame anyone if, if, if... Of course I'm in love, love, love... Whatever you want from me, I'm here, here here... Yours, yours, yours will I be and become if you'll only be mine, mine, mine. The paradise road is cracked and long, but you shall see... No! It's you who's cracked! The road is crooked. I guess I'm both a bit cracked and a bit crooked. The paradise road is crooked and long, but you shall see... ...the clouds above are never as heavenly as here... Where it is blue, blue, blue for ever and ever... On top, top top... On top of a budding romance! Bravo! What shall we do now? Drink! What shall we do between drinks? Now I've taken you through enjoying a fancy dinner. What more does a rich beauty need to know about? Drinking. You seem good at that already! Here's to her who was divine! Here's to you, croaker! This cocktail's tasting better and better. You know, you have lots and lots to learn. Do you know how to bathe at the Riviera without getting wet? Can you sail to Sandhamn without a boat? Nope! Or could you display the latest spring hats? You're stupid. How could I do that? I don't have a spring hat. You poor little thing! You don't have a spring hat? No, I don't have one! You shall get a spring hat, if you stop hitting me. Here we are now... - Here's your spring hat. - Wot you say? - New season's hat! - No, it's my hat. - You're under the influence. - No, I'm under the hat! Hey... you got more to teach me? Can you show off the latest sport creation? No, you can't! No, I can't. I'll teach you... Winter in Aare... Now that it's winter I slide down the slope and twist and turn - hurrah, hurrah! Sara, turn the radio on and come and help me. This has gotta go... the rug's gotta go... Full speed ahead! Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce the famous ice cream... queen... ...the glorious Sara... ...and partner... This is worth a drink... I haven't fallen in 5 minutes. - Greetings ice-princess. - Greetings, ice-prince. Hurry up! Time for our big number...!. Off you go! Want to borrow my bobsled? You have a turn. I do NOT like Fanny. And I'll never marry for money. You or Teddy better make a move on Sara, before someone else grabs her. - What are you saying? - Absolute rubbish! You think so?! - Isn't she mad about you? - Shut up! I'm only trying to help. If I were a guy I'd go for Sara, even if she didn't have a penny. That'd be different. So there is some interest?! - There's always hope... - Don't hope too much. You'll be disappointed Maybe Teddy isn't as stupid as you. Are you getting nervous? Stop it, Monica! Look! What on earth is this? George! Warning! Toboggan run! Boat to Aare Excellent salmon fishing and reindeer Laplander with wife To the bar The Riviera What does all this mean? That they had a lot more fun than we did. G' morn'n... Let's get on top, top top... ...On top of a budding romance! Yours, yours, yours will I be... I'm in love with you. I'm not Teddy, you know! I certainly do! It's you... George... And I tell you, I'm in love with you. You hear?! Yes, I heard you. Get undressed and go to sleep! George... ...come here and help me. Don't be so stupid! I'm not stupid. I'm in love with you. Why can't you kiss me? Just a teeny weeny little kiss.... Why? It's not me who's in love. I don't just kiss anybody! But you kiss that Berg bird? Maybe I do. Without asking permission! No... that's not true... It's not true? No... because you don't like her. Who told you that? Teddy. That idiot! Rest assured, I shall marry Miss Berg! You're lying! You're gonna marry me! That's what want! It's not what I want. Good night! - How does she feel? - I'm sure she's asleep. You're lying! - I don't understand a thing. - It's best that way, Mummy. Good night, George! Good night. - Good morning! - G'morning... How do you feel? The shakes. Yes, you don't go unpunished the morning after. Drink this. What time of day is it? Nearly breakfast time. What did you Teddy get up to? The tables were stacked up. The ski run...! I'm so unhappy, Monica! You've nothing to be unhappy about. And I said a lot of stupid things to George. That I was in love with him... That wasn't very diplomatic. A man wants to conquer... not be conquered.. Yes, I know. It's probably best I get away from here. But where would I go? What a question! If I were in your shoes, I'd travel. Vienna, Rome, The Riviera... That's where Teddy and I were, last night. I can't travel alone. I only speak Swedish... ...and barely that. Monica, you and I could travel together! To the other side of town? But I've got money. I wouldn't want to borrow. Borrow? You can have as much as you want. Awfully sweet of you... But I'm poor but proud. There's no way that I'd... No, it's difficult for first-timers. What do you mean? I've left a novel with a publisher... but it's probably not going to be accepted. Otherwise I would have gone with you. Hurry up now, and have a shower before breakfast. Monica! Do you really believe that George will marry Miss Berg? With Fanny? No I don't think so. George would never marry someone who was rich. That's your biggest fault, too, as far as he's concerned. You think so?! I know it. Monica! How can a person get rid of their money quickly? As if it would be hard?! Clothes, jewellery, cars... Hurry up now. If Mummy says anything, blame Teddy. Who's that? - It's only me. - What do you want? All I want is a cold, cold shower. I can well imagine! I'm nearly finished. Shut the door! What are you up to?! Scram! I hate seeing clothes so untidy. Just leave them alone! What a cute little slipper...! Scram, before something happens! If there's something you'd like, Sir, just step forward. Step forward?! Otherwise, I dictate the terms. Terms? Number one... Sir must admit he's in love with me. That's the stupidest thing... Your late-night visit spoke for itself. Number two... You're to be polite to me. I didn't say a word, even though you woke me. Woke you...? ...and aroused me. I didn't sleep a wink afterwards. Number three... Couldn't you say this, George...? ''Sara, it's not your fault that you are rich.'' I forgive you, because... I like you and I want to marry you. Couldn't you say that, George? Then I'll go. Never! Even if I am in love with you. So much that it hurts. I don't want money as a gift. Money money money! As if that was everything! Think what you'd give me! a family who loves me, a new upbringing... ...all that you can give me in return for the money you scream about. But you'll soon have no reason to scream! ...to the Artists' Aged Care Home's George Haller's donation fund.'' This is crazy, Sara! ''The undersigned is to remain anonymous. Stockholm the 17th Nov...Sara Holm...'' Doesn't the money mean anything to you? No, Johan, it doesn't mean a thing. You must be loaded to give away half a million. You must be very much in love, too. But it's lovely what you're doing with your money. Old Mr Haller blew all his money on shares. Can you lose money with those? Look at this... He lost nearly everything on this sort of thing. ''Kwiksteel faces insolvency..." "Shares fall catastrophically."' Count yourself lucky not having those shares. Why do you want to buy Kwiksteel? They're the worst shares on the market. You're gambling a fortune. Look at the listings... Kwiksteel falling every day. You lose on that. Don't be too sure about that! As you wish... I can't force you... But remember you've been warned. I believe I'll be a winner out of this. A winner? You know something? Have you heard rumours? Thanks for your banking help. Lofberg, have you heard any rumours on Kwiksteel, we could take advantage of? Nothing? I'd be happy to produce her book, if you pay for what it costs. Her manuscript was in fact better than most we get. That's very kind of you. Kind? You're the one who's being kind. I understand this patronage is to be kept quiet. - It's essential she doesn't know! - I understand. Let's see what this will cost. The advance to Miss Haller... 500 kronor. 500?! For all that writing she did? Couldn't we make it at least 3,000? 3,000? If people found out I'd paid 3,000 for a first novel, I'd be finished. My dear kind sir... Just for my sake? I'll very likely regret this... but for your sake... You seem to have decided to throw money away. Would this be suitable for an older lady...? She looks a bit younger than her age. That would be splendid. - And this for a young woman? - How do you like it yourself? I know nothing about such things.. Is it fashionable? - Terribly! - Terribly?! It's very chic! I understand... it's timeless. Put it in. - Yes, we'll take that. - It will be delivered after registration. -17,500? - Yes, with a discount for cash. That's not necessary. Here's the cheque... I'll get you a receipt. Would you like this? I think it's best you take care of this. Didn't you get anything? This is for you. Be careful with him. He had a tummy upset today. Poor thing! Did you have a sore tummy? We'll find you something else. Would you like this instead? There you are. But Bjorn, what are you throwing away? Is this right? Yes... but Bjorn didn't want it. - Did you give him 1,000 kronor? - Yes, he couldn't eat the lollipop. Put it back in your purse, Miss! Is it forbidden to give the children money? - No, it's not forbidden... - Let me give something. - All of it? - With my compliments. Share it amongst them all. Goodbye... Thanks for letting me visit. Miss... do you really know what you're doing? It's the most sensible thing I've done in a long time. I was in a home once, just like this. That's why... Goodbye, kids! Mum! Come and look at this! You're looking at the owner of a very fancy... Take a look! Where on earth did you get that from? From Sara, with thanks for the most enjoyable dinner she'd ever had. This is what I got. I think she's got confused. Confused? Maybe... but she's a dream come true! Just take a look what I got from Sara! And look what I got. We can't accept all this. - Really? No, perhaps not. - Why not, for heaven's sake?! - But it's very sweet of her. - Yes... where ids she? Sara! Here I am. Why on earth...?! Thank you, you sweet little imp! Here she is for you all! A million thanks... but it was far too generous! Shall I thank you, or cry? I'll thank you first. What is it, Hulda? Look at this, Ma'am! Sara, are you absolutely crazy? Where is an old biddy like me going, wrapped up like this?! It's a snazzy bit of wrapping!. You'll ruin yourself, Sara. But it's beautiful... Let me see... It's a pleasure to look at it. Hello... yes... just a moment please. - It's for you, Sara. - For me? Come and give us a look, Hulda. This is Gyllenberg, manager at Nordsvenska Bank. - This is a sad story. - What is? What? - Is it serious? - The cheques were not covered. It's criminal. You'd given away all the money. What shall I do? I've calmed them down, but that will only last a day or two. You have to find money, Miss Holm. Yes, Sir. Believe me, it would've cost at least 5,000. 5,000?! How could she... Sara! Where has Sara gone? Hello, Sir. Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir... Goodbye, Sir. Three thousand!... Three thousand! Have you gone crazy or won the Nobel prize? The publisher's taken my book... with 3,000 as an advance! How much do you want to borrow? Never from a woman! But since you're my sister... 1,000 for me to travel and have fun with... ...and 2,000 to you for 24 years bed and board! Long live the honorable donor! One more time! Stop this stupidity... I haven't donated any money. Don't be shy! Thank you, Georgie-Porgie! Sara...? What's this all about? Do you know? Don't ask now. We'll go somewhere, where we can talk in peace! ...and Teddy's car. Goodness, Sara, how could you have got rid of every penny? I'm almost ashamed of your stupidity. But you wanted me to be poor! Of course not! I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it then? Sara... darling little Sara... Was all this just for my sake? The worst thing is that I can't get to kiss you, hug you to death... Let's hurry. Can I pay? I'll tell your waitress. I'll go off straightaway. You wait for the 8 o'clock train. - Yes, but... - Just do as I say. I have to rush now, to catch the train. George! I don't have any money. What was it you wanted? Why are you all acting strangely? The money for my last year at the academy and the study tour... - How much was that? - 5 to 6,000. Can I get it now? What for? There's something I want to talk about. It isn't enough that Sara made that crazy donation... Was that HER?! She's gone through all her money and overdrawn her cheque account by 30,000. That's punishable! 18 months! It's no laughing matter! Who's laughing? We'll have to return the gifts. I can drive the car back right away. So that will just leave 3,000 short. That's what I get for the book! Take it. - How sweet of you Monica. - All so moving... Take my last tenner. Good evening! Am I interrupting? Sara, you've nothing to fear, now. It's fixed. We've sorted it all out. I've told all about your bad decisions. We like you just as much without money. I'm sure you knew that already. But why give up everything? Well it wasn't all wasted. I forgot to mention it. What? Sara and I are getting engaged tomorrow. George... are you quite serious? I'll put it in writing if you wish. Yes please... as I have a little secret. What is it now? I'm not as broke as I thought. There's been a boom on the stock exchange. I bought for 300,000. I've made 120,000 more. Well I'll be damned! ''Huge rally! Rises in Bofors, Granges and Kwiksteel..." Do you still like me? Well, since I promised... Sara, have you become a share-trader? Georgie... can I have my tenner back? Quick! I'll put it to work! You only think about money. What do you two think about? Us? We don't think at all... Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
