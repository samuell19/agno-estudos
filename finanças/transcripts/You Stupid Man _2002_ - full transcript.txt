- I Iove you. - I Iove you too. Every time it wiII snow, I wiII think of you. You can't imagine how much I Iove you. I'II miss you Iike crazy. You won't miss me because I'II come to Los AngeIes - whenever I can. - Promise ? - I am your number one admirer. - No. You are the Iove of my Iife. I'm that, too. - Promise you wiII come ? - I promise. BeIieve me. Every day with her was magic. My Iife was perfect. My work at the magazine was going weII and my girIfriend had just become famous. Just Iike in the movies. Passionate kisses under the snow, perfect iIIumination and nobody ever goes to the bathroom. But now she was in Los AngeIes, ready to bIossom, and I was in New York withering away. So I decided to get going. I organized a surprise visit. I wouId teII her I was staying there forever. Stacey, what do you think ? I have a perfect definition: bad Iuck. I can do it. - We need a magic wand. - Right. Where wiII we find two guys who are so idiotic as to buy us cIothes - and take us to the party ? - HeIIo ! Stop ! It was magnificent. Kids, Iunch break. You were reaIIy good. No, I was disgusting. I couId have done this scene better. I feeI depressed ! You were into the character. There was confIict between you two. I didn't feeI any confIict. - Is it the diaIogue ? - No. It's me ! - The production disIikes the fiIm. - The network, too. At Ieast we are in agreement. We have to work on it. - Excuse me. Where's ChIoe Francis ? - Over there. - I'm Iooking for ChIoe Francis. - I'II sign for her. There's nothing to sign. I am her boyfriend. I think she's in her traiIer. It's around the corner. - ChIoe ? - Oh, Rodger ! Surprise. Wait. It's not what you think. You weren't having sex ? He Iost his keys and was Iooking for them ? No, we were trying out a scene. A scene where you're a cat in heat ? Stop it. You are embarrassing me. You're embarrassed ? IncredibIe. How shouId I feeI ? LittIe brother, you must react. Remember, ''What doesn't kiII you, makes you stronger''. Then after this, I'II win the championship for weight Iifters. Look at the positive side. You're a writer. The most beautifuI Iove songs are the ones about broken hearts. - Maybe you'II write better now. - Jack, I write two bit articIes for a magazine. - Owen... - This is the new tv star, ChIoe Francis. You suddenIy became a star. - How do you face Iife now ? - I found a marveIous man. Don't you think you might have probIems dating a coIIeague ? On the contrary. - It makes work more rewarding. - Rewarding ? How is that ? You can put the pistachio into the pistachio container. - My God ! - He is... WiII you excuse me ? WeII ? How is he ? He moaned from the bed to the sofa. It's a good sign. I have fantastic news. ChIoe said she's coming to the wedding. What's the fantastic news ? - I checked the astroIogicaI chart. - PIease ! Jack, those two are made for each other. I Iove you. I'm gIad you are into astroIogy, and that our sex Iife depends on the moons in Venus, but don't ever teII Owen what you just said to me. Not Owen and ChIoe, but Owen and Nadine. - Diane, no ! - You must do something. - The stars are impIoring it. - It's not true. Last night Orion toId me, ''Forget it''. Jack, remember how we met ? Yes. You were on the baIcony at that party and I came up to you and stepped on your foot. Remember what you said ? - ''Watch out for my foot.'' - Right. - Remember what I said ? - Yes. ''IncredibIe ! Watch out for my foot has 5 syIIabIes ! Your Iucky number in Iove is 5.'' Right. I was right about us, and wiII be right about them. It's different. He is your best man and she is my bridesmaid. - I think it'II be very sweet. - Sweet ? You are my best man and she's Diane's bridesmaid. - It'II be very sweet. - Sweet ? You've become gay ! - You need a girIfriend. - I don't need a girIfriend ! Stop ! Hands up or I'II shoot ! Turn around and face the waII ! - PuII your pants down, fags ! - What ? PuII your pants down ! Hurry ! Turn around. - My boxer shorts are being washed. - SmiIe ! Are you crazy ? What's the matter with you ? Idiot ! We are in a pubIic pIace ! - Don't touch me ! - You peed in your pants ! He is a New York poIiceman ! Is that how you do yourjob ? Is that how you treat your brother ? Great ! I needed this picture for my Christmas greeting cards. Owen, Iisten ! - You shouId go out with Nadine. - It's not the right moment ! ChIoe is coming to the wedding. - ChIoe's coming to the wedding ? - Yes. ChIoe is coming to the wedding ? FabuIous ! It's great news. - I don't think so. - It's true. If she comes to your wedding, it means she wants to see me. She is coming with her boyfriend. Pistachio for the pistachio container. - HeIIo. May I take your coat ? - Yes, thanks. - Thanks. - To you. - You are beautifuI. - Thank you. I wasn't expecting someone so pretty. Is that a compIiment ? UsuaIIy pretty girIs don't accept these dates. Why ? Pretty girIs are onIy avaiIabIe for about ten seconds. - Is that so ? - Right. Like fuII breed dogs in the town kenneI. They're the first to go. Did you compare me to a dog ? - You compared me to a dog. - No. I wanted... I meant in a nice way. Jack toId me that you work for a tv news station. Isn't that so ? The news Iady ? HeIIo ? Is anyone here ? You don't feeI Iike taIking ? Don't you want to taIk to me ? IncredibIe. If you got so upset for what I said about the dog, I don't need to apoIogize because it was a compIiment. Good evening. Want to have a drink before you order ? Daughter of a ''Iesser god'', want a drink ? She is eIaborating. She's a bit sIow. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to compare you to a dog. I wouIdn't do it with any woman. I'm sorry. - I'd Iike a gin tonic. - Good. And for you, sir ? A pitcher of naturaI water. I had never aIIowed a girI to bite my earIobe. But with ChIoe I abdicated. DetaiIs Iike that, understand ? I am possessive in generaI. We Ioved each other very much. - SaIad. - Thanks. - Enjoy your meaI. - Thank you. Why ? When wiII they stop using these horribIe sauces ? - Better to put it here. - Yes. I'm sorry. Sauces make me vomit. - Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise... - I know them. When I order a steak, I want to taste the beef. - Why put ketchup on it ? - Maybe it gives it more fIavor. No. It's Iike putting deodorants in bathrooms. PeopIe spray pine scented perfume thinking it covers the smeII. Instead, it smeIIs Iike someone peed on a Christmas tree. - It was a pIeasure meeting you. - For me too. - Maybe I'II see you again. - Yes. It wouId be nice. - I'II caII you. - You have my number. - Okay. - Okay. - I'II take the next one. - Thanks. Remember that. You are the fox and they are the sheep. - I am the fox. - And they are the sheep. SingIe out one of them, and make her become your target... I don't want to have sex with anyone. I just want a cute girI who doesn't beIong to the sheep famiIy to take to the wedding so ChIoe doesn't think I'm a Ioser. - You're the fox. They're the sheep. - I am the fox. - You don't Iike tattoos ? - Yes, I do. What are these signs ? - These are my sados. - Your sados ? Every once in a whiIe I give myseIf an incision. How cooI ! What did I want to say ? Tonight you wiII meet someone speciaI. I can feeI it. But don't Ieave me aIone with some freak. What time is it ? - I'm sorry. I don't have a watch. - I Iove you. You Iove me ? Want to check my cannon ? - Is it Ioaded ? - Of course. Can I do a manuaI check ? - CertainIy. - Okay. I'II Ieave you two. Did you find a girI to take to the wedding ? No. I have gas probIems. This pIace stinks and you're a freak. I am a freak. Tonight you wiII meet the Iove of your Iife. What is it ? Did I guess ? - He's cute tonight. - No, pIease ! - You think he is cute ? - Cute enough. PIease, don't come here. PIease, don't come here ! - Owen, come here. - What are you doing ? - I am encouraging fate. - Worry about your own. - This pIace is cooI. - Good-bye, Owen. - How are you ? - Fine, and you ? - Fine. It's cooI here. - Yes. - I'm sorry about Iast week. - No. I shouId apoIogize. - You were very rude. - You aIways taIked about your ex. Your mouth was shut tight. You compared our orders to someone who peed on a Christmas tree. - I was soIving a probIem for you. - A probIem ? Jack and Diane said you were Iooking for a boyfriend. I wanted to heIp. I don't know if you're aware of it, but a wedding creates strong emotionaI tension for women. We become vuInerabIe and uptight. What are you saying ? I say you can get your ass out of here ! It's that I bIoat... I'm nervous. - That is evident. - I'II change air. - A IoveIy voice. - Yes. - Nice tits too. - You have a one track mind ! Which is ? I preferred making this decision... - I'd Iike two gIasses of champagne. - Right away. I prefer a beer. - That's for Robert, right ? - Rodger. Rodger, right ! - Okay, how did... - I took it very weII. I took it weII. I am surprised at how weII I took it. WeII... Okay. And how are you ? How did you take it ? I took it quite weII. The program is doing beautifuIIy. I was very busy, and now I've decided to take a break. That way I can ''chamomiIe''. - What ? - ReIax. For a moment I thought I was dysIexic. Your extravagant sIang... I'm not used to it. - I have to go. - Wait ! Excuse me. Sorry. I didn't want... CouIdn't we... taIk ? - Just a minute. - We have nothing more to say. I stiII have to say a Iot of things. For exampIe, ''Why'' ? Why did you do what you did ? You think this is the right time and pIace to discuss it ? - WeII... - It's not. I have nothing to say. I'm sorry that it's tough for you. I am sorry you are suffering. I had not intention of faIIing in Iove with Rodger. - Itjust happened. - Just happened ? SpiIIing over wine or Iosing a waIIet is something that happens, but going to bed with the other Iead roIe does not happen ! Thanks. Is there a word to describe a cynic and crueI Iiar ? I am surprised at how weII I took it. You too ? We found a peeping Tom. - Are you taIking to me ? - Yes. He was Iooking. - You must Iook at the waII. - Were you Iooking at my dick ? It's none of your business ! I wasn't Iooking. I have a neck-ache. I dropped something. He was Iooking at me ! Buy a porno magazine ! It's reaIIy something. Shut off that Iight. Everything is okay, honey. Good evening. I am Owen. Since I am not good at making speeches in pubIic, I'II onIy steaI a few seconds of your time. I'd Iike to propose a toast in honor of our dear newIyweds. Shakespeare says, ''Love comforts us as the sun after the rain.'' Cummings says, ''Love is everything, and more than everything.'' My brother Brady says, ''Love is a wrestIing match''. Many say they have known it, but few reaIIy have. FrankIy, Iove is disgusting. After a year, it becomes a series of terribIe things. Bad breath in the earIy morning, remembering to Iower the toiIet seat. Often Iove is a big kick in the stomach that knocks you out and Ieaves you IifeIess. But Iove makes bad breath seem Iike a deodorant spray. It reminds you to Iower the toiIet seat. It is a more nobIe gesture than that of hoIding the queen's train. It is the hand that makes you rise when you are down. Love gives us the hope that one day we wiII be abIe to reveaI ourseIves to another person. And that another person wiII turn to us, and somehow, for some reason, we wiII feeI more compIete. In concIuding, Iove is what makes us wake up every morning and has us try again. When I think of these two peopIe, I can't wait to set my aIarm and face another day. So, to Jack and Diane. It was a great speech. - Not bad, huh ? - Not at aII. - It was aImost perfect. - AImost perfect ! - Let's go drink something. - Okay. - It's as if I were my boyfriend. - You, your boyfriend ? Six months ago I broke up with Jeffrey, my boyfriend. Why ? Our reIationship had come to a dead end. So one day I returned home, had him sit down and said, ''It can't go on this way. I need more.'' - So he broke up with you. - No. He asked me to marry him. - I wasn't expecting that. - Neither was I. I was petrified. A Iot of scenes went through my mind. My mother crying, me dressed as a nervous bride, my father taking me to the aItar... Then, suddenIy, an iIIumination. I had never thought of going to the aItar with him. I had never imagined my son on his knees. He did not correspond to what I aIways dreamed of. So we broke up. You teII a guy you are Ieaving him if he doesn't ask to marry you, and then you break up with him when he does ! - Yes. - I hope we never faII in Iove. I wouIdn't worry about that. She didn't Iike to sIeep aIone, so when I wasn't with her, - she bought the New York Post. - The paper ? I know it seems strange, but it made her feeI better. She read the whoIe paper in bed and forgot about being aIone. After that horribIe fact, when I caught them together, I decided to forgive her and Iooked aII over Los AngeIes untiI I found a copy of the New York Post, and took it to her home. I didn't say a word. I just gave her the paper. She Iooked at me in surprise and said, ''I don't beIieve it. Am I on the front page again ?'' - That can't be ! - You're teIIing me ! I'm sorry, I know it's not funny for you. I'm sorry. You are beautifuI when you Iaugh. You know that ? - We'd better go now. - Sure. Let's go. You were nice to take pity on me. - I didn't pity you. - I'm not compIaining. I get aII shook up when peopIe pity me. Then no good-night kiss. Going to bed is out of the question, right ? - Everything seemed too perfect. - AIways exaggerating ! - Do you think it's normaI ? - It's not the end of the worId ! I'm not cheating on Diane. I chat on Internet. It's not the end of the worId ? You are married ! We send each other e-maiIs. That's aII. - Can I have her e-maiI address ? - No ! - Don't be seIfish. - Okay. ''Jane doesn't do it. com.'' Try with Internet. You get fantastic chicks. I don't know if his new girIfriend wouId Iike that. What ? Nadine ? - You go to bed with her ? - No. She heIps me with ChIoe. If we went to bed together, I couIdn't ask her advice on ChIoe. You mean to teII me you don't have sex with that woman because you two taIk about another woman you don't have sex with ? It's Iike having an infiItrate in the enemy camp. Did you ever want to ask your girIfriend questions but you couIdn't, because she is your girIfriend ? I can ask her anything I want because we don't pIay on the same team. We're Iike 2 agents heIping each other to get advantageous contracts. I am Iearning a Iot of secrets on what women think. Secrets ? Can you ask her something for me ? - No. - It's a Iegitimate question. AIright. Let's hear it. Ask her if 45 centimeters is too much. You massacre her ! This is the most beautifuI Saint VaIentine's day of my Iife. And you are the best person I couId ever have met. I have never been so much in Iove. I am the Iuckiest man in the worId ! Jeffrey, hi. Hi, Nadine. This is my girIfriend, Audrey. She's not your girIfriend. - PIease, don't. - My pIeasure. I am... Don't give him your hand ! - Everything okay ? - You shouIdn't have a girIfriend. You shouId be crying over me. Did he teII you I broke up with him ? - Don't Iook at me Iike that. - Like what ? As if to say, ''You'II become an oId madwoman who buys food for cats and everyone wiII Iaugh at you knowing you don't have a cat !'' - Breathe. - Let's go. Why is it that every time I break up with a man I insist on trying to get back with him for about a year ? I Ieft him, but he doesn't want to go back with me. - Why ? - You want to go back with him ? - No. - No. That's not the point. He shouId want to go back with me. - What are you doing ? - Want to be my girIfriend ? Stop it ! Today is Saint VaIentine's day and we are both singIe. We can go back home aIone and be desoIate or spend some time together having fun. What can we do ? Anything. I have aIways wanted to do something. - What ? - Wander about with no destination. - Wander about with no destination ! - I never knew what that meant. It's Iike in oId movies. Two Iovers waIk with arms Iinked with a background of Iuminous signs. I'II Iike it a Iot, and I hope you wiII Iike mine. - Mine is smaIIer. - It's not the size that counts. You first. AIright. Don't open yours untiI I open mine. Let's see. - Is it Snoopy ? - Yes. - They're fantastic ! - You won't have coId feet anymore. - What do I have ? - You can't have coId feet if you must face an obstacIe race. You can warm them up and be ready to go in the fieId. They are beautifuI. Thanks. - I'm gIad. - Now it's your turn. A mirror. - Am I too vain ? - No. I gave it to you because when I am depressed it boosts my moraIe to see you smiIe. So when you're a IittIe down, you just have to Iook in the mirror and you'II see how wonderfuI your smiIe is. It's the nicest thing a man ever said to me. Honesty. It is beautifuI. - I'm gIad. - I Iike it very much. - They're fun. - Thanks. It's magnificent. - FeeI better ? - I feeI great ! I understood your message, but it doesn't matter. - What ? - You think my ass is disgusting. - You think that ! - I didn't give it to you for that ! You never say, ''Nadine, today you are reaIIy beautifuI'' or ''Nadine, you're reaIIy sexy with that dress !'' You aIways say, ''You have a marveIous smiIe''. Did I ever teII you your tits make me go crazy ? - Sure I can come ? - Sure. Some peopIe take their daughters to work. I take my best friend with whom I don't go to bed. You haven't seen your ex in months and are interviewing her. I don't... Don't worry. It's history. I feeI unsinkabIe. This way. I feeI positive. The interview with ChIoe wiII do me good. - You Iook very good. - Thanks. WiII you hoId this ? - Good Iuck. - I need it. - Don't worry. I'II stay here. - Okay. - How are you ? - Very good. Nice to see you again. It's amazing that you're doing the interview. Excuse me ! WiII someone heIp me ? - I smeared make-up on him. - It doesn't matter. - You're aII bIack. - It doesn't matter. - You reaIIy smeared it ! - Let me see. It won't go away. Poor me ! It's not so bad. Enough. I'm fine. It wiII be a magnificent interview. Yes. - Want something to drink ? - A gIass of water, pIease. Okay. I'II teII you what I want to do. I wiII begin with some easy questions. You wiII promote your program. I'II have a Iot of magazine copies soId. - ShaII we begin to dance ? - It wiII be marveIous. I'II give a fake smiIe and suffer in answering idiotic questions. Fantastic ! Let's begin. Has your Iife styIe improved a Iot since you've become famous ? There's no comparison ! I've aIways been on top and used to hypocrites and ruffians, but now it's different. Now everyone wants to be a ruffian ! Even me ! You took my heart and trampIed on it ! - Isn't it fun ? - AbsoIuteIy ! TeII me about your future projects. My agent teIIs peopIe I wiII onIy do smaII roIes in independent quaIity fiIms, but actuaIIy... I met a big producer in Los AngeIes and I did a IittIe ''something'' for him Iast week. Want something to drink ? ShaII we begin to dance ? I can't beIieve you Ieft. - You didn't finish the interview ? - I didn't even start. - Come on. It didn't go so badIy. - Not so bad. You're right. She couId've ignored that I had been the Iove of her Iife and treated me Iike an admirer. - In fact, she did. - Maybe this can heIp you. The CompIete Guide for Idiots on BuiIding a Love ReIationship. - You're a moron ! - Why ? CongratuIations, Jack. He's onIy trying to heIp you. He shouId wash his dirty Iaundry in his own house before washing mine. - What do you mean ? - I don't need his heIp. ReaIIy ? That's the funniestjoke I've ever heard. - Owen, over 6 months have gone by. - Six months from what ? You act as if she were a gift from God, but she isn't. I'm not in Iove with her anymore. I want to end that story. That's nonsense ! I think you enjoy suffering. You think being desperate over her is Iike having her. It's not. You of aII peopIe speak, ''Miss, I am my boyfriend''. - What do you mean ? - I've decided to Iive my Iife. Oh, pIease ! I was there with Jeffrey ! You aren't Iiving a thing, and one day you'II reaIize that being aIone wiII not make you become a priest of the New Age. But I don't drooI over the person that cheated on me. - Want to aIways be a fIoor mat ? - You are a manipuIator ! - What ? - You want to marry your beIoved so you force the poor guy to ask you to marry him. Then you tear out his heart and crush it untiI... He cheated on me with another woman ! He went to bed with someone eIse. AIright ? Oh, God ! Look at me. I have to cIose my mouth. I taIk too much. I was worried about you. I'm sorry, but why didn't you teII me ? I screamed Iike a madman. - Sorry. I didn't know... - You are so sweet ! PeopIe shouId never get married. AII the obstacIes you manage to overcome when you are engaged, become more difficuIt. - LuckiIy I stiII have my computer. - God bIess us aII ! - What do you taIk about with her ? - About Iife. About Iife ? You write to her about Iife ? How profound ! I didn't know you were interested in such compIex topics. They're not aIways so compIex, if you know what I mean. You didn't go to bed with her, did you ? - Not exactIy. - Not exactIy ? And yet, it's an exact science. We started a IittIe something. You know... We do it on the computer. Aren't you ashamed ? What do you do ? TeII me how it works. First you taIk, then you get excited... And Iock yourseIf in the bathroom. It's disgusting ! When do you do it ? At work ? What's the probIem ? I forgot. I'm taIking to a man who never sits down on a pubIic toiIet. Now you know why. I rented ''Meet Me in Saint Louis.'' I'II wait for you to return. Bye. Owen, it's ChIoe. Hi ! - She caIIed me. - Who ? ChIoe caIIed me. - FeeI Iike Iistening ? - You recorded the message ? - I record memorabIe messages. - Sure. You're a freak. Sit down and open your ears. Owen, it's ChIoe. I need to taIk to you. I have to ask you something. I hope you can forget the past and be abIe to taIk about the future. - Not bad, huh ? - I don't know. Can't you perceive desire in her voice ? Maybe. - She wants to discuss the future. - Owen. What is it ? - Yes, I perceive desire. - I'm gIad. I thought I was the onIy one. - Let me Iisten to it again. - Let's Iisten to it 14 times ! Hey, ChIoe. Hi ! Your sixth pIanet has started turning around my sixth moon. Hi, ChIoe ! It's nice to see you again. You Iook great. Hi, IittIe one. OnIy you can acceIerate the beat of my heart. Hi, ChIoe. How's it going ? You have a new hair styIe. - Thanks so much for coming. - Forget it. - Thanks. - A gIass of naturaI water. - You Iook good. - Thanks. It's the truth. I'm reaIIy sorry about everything that happened. If someone shouId apoIogize, I'm the one. - I was a reaI idiot. - Listen. The past is over. The important thing is the future, right ? You've aIways been very understanding. It's no wonder I feII in Iove with you. - Forgive me for what I did ? - Sure. Love is that, too... Knowing how to forgive. I'm gIad to hear you say it because I have to ask you something. Whatever you want. When you Ieft during our interview another person came from your magazine to interview me. A reaI bitter guy. I toId him something idiotic because Rodger and I had argued. Now he is threatening to write that in the articIe. - So it's about the articIe ? - Yes. - You thought I wanted... - It doesn't matter. I'm sorry. - I thought you knew... - What ? Rodger and I... are compIementary. ReaIIy ? I'm gIad to hear you say that. I'm reaIIy happy for you. - Owen, does that mean... - I'II fix up the articIe. Yes. Thanks. Owen, you're great. You're wonderfuI. You'II find a girI who is better than she is. That's what everyone says, but what if I don't ? What if it was her ? Owen, come here. Come here. Come. What do you see ? A desperate man and a woman who is pIaying with a phaIIic symboI. - Owen, come on ! What do you see ? - A bottIe of ketchup. Right. Now go around the tabIe with me. Look cIoseIy. Here in front we see the IabeI. Here on the side we don't see it anymore. OnIy transparent gIass. If we move to the back, we see aII the ingredients. Are we evoking the spirit of dead tomatoes ? The fact is that your reIationship with ChIoe... You are Iooking at it from a wrong point of view. Maybe it wasn't the right moment. Understand ? Or maybe... Maybe there's someone eIse who... Who is perfect for you, but you don't see her because you see things from the wrong angIe. WouId you marry this girI ? - Look at her hair ! - I wouId marry this one ! TerminaI patient... - We spoke again. - No, pIease ! - We are perfect for each other. - Is she an idiot too ? There is a deep understanding between us. I don't know what's happening to him. He's been acting strangeIy. So am I. It's as if Mercury inside of me has been Iagging - for over a year. - What are you taIking about ? I feeI trapped. My Iife is just duty and obIigation. I am no Ionger myseIf. I want to be ''us''. You Iike being us. You've aIways wanted to be us. You hate being you. I don't know anymore. Why don't you try taIking to him ? - Here it is. Fibers are heaIthy. - You Iook good, in great shape. I didn't do anything. It was the ketchup. - You hate ketchup. - As a food. But if you Iook at it from the right angIe, it has magic powers. I gave him a phiIosophy Iesson, but it didn't work. Yes, it did. He is fine. Right, honey ? I don't know how to judge men. True. You just care about other women. - I went out with a girI. - What ? - Great ! With who ? - A bIind date. Was she pretty ? A pretty woman does not go on a bIind date. - WeII, was she pretty ? - PIeasant. - But not pretty. - Yes. - Was she pIeasant or pretty ? - She was pretty and pIeasant. - But she wasn't beautifuI, right ? - You women are compIicated ! Out with it. I want aII the detaiIs. It was strange. I reaIize I am out of practice. - Of course. What happened ? - The usuaI first date. A nice evening, a few drinks - and I took her home. - You took her home ? It's strange. We got there and started to kiss. - But she stopped me. - Why ? If I knew the answer to that question and other mysteries of the femaIe mind, I wouIdn't feeI Iike this. What happened ? To start over, I said something sweet. - What did you say ? - I said, ''I had a nice time''. - Go on. - How can I expIain it ? I was about to be successfuI when she stopped me again. - So I said... - Let me guess. - You said something sweet. - I said, ''We shouId see each other again and do it another time.'' I knew it ! You're a pig Iike aII men ! - Why are you upset ? - I'm not. Now I understand. - You understand what ? - Oh, nothing. TeII me what you understand. - Are you jeaIous ? - No. It is understandabIe. We spent a Iot of time together. We have become good friends. You have a right to be... You're a pig because you weren't sincere. Hi. - I didn't Iie. - Yes, you did. You Ied her to beIieve you had emotions you didn't feeI. You know something ? You are perfectIy right. Do you reaIize what that means ? I went out with a girI and it wasn't a disaster ! Thanks to you, and the bottIe of ketchup. I changed my prospective. - I hope I didn't hear properIy. - What ? You are reaIIy stupid... - Can you expIain that ? - Forget it. - I am stupid ? - It's nothing. Forget it. AIright. I'II forget it. You see why you are stupid ? I teII you to forget it - and what do you do ? - I forget it. Yes. Forget it. I wiII never forget how strong our Iove was at the beginning of our reIationship. We aIways said that we wouId never become one of those cIaustrophobic coupIes who suffocate each other. I don't know if we got out of step or if one of us tripped, but we Iost each other aIong the way. Maybe it aII began the first time I raised my voice, or maybe the first time you ignored me. Or... when we feII asIeep with our backs turned the first time. I don't know whose fauIt it is, and I don't care. I onIy know that we must definiteIy stop grabbing each other's throats and trying to transform the grasp into an embrace. We must try to Iighten the hoId. We must try to Iighten the hoId. I aIways Iiked words that seem to say one thing but reaIIy mean something eIse. When I was IittIe I was convinced that ''rock star'' was a star that was very rocky. Understand ? Rock, star... And ''migraine''. I was convinced it meant ''my wheat''. The best one was ''cardioIogist''. Every time someone mentioned a cardioIogist, I yeIIed, - I want to Iearn great card games ! - I see. Like ''backIot''. It's a Iot that is situated in the back. It reaIIy sounds Iike that. Amusing, huh ? Yes, but that's what it is. - Excuse me. She is Jasmine. - My pIeasure. - My pIeasure. - Of course... - He is PaoIo. - Hi, chum. My pIeasure. - Why in this area ? - We went to see a fiIm then went to the amusement park and he won this stuffed bear. - It's fantastic ! - And then... We decided to take a waIk in the park. - Are you mad at me ? - No ! Why do you think that ? I have nothing to criticize you for. - Did you two date before ? - I thought that too. We are onIy good friends. She wants to meet me. Great ! Where ? In her bathroom or yours ? - What is your probIem ? - You are. - You gave up on Iove. I didn't. - Gave up ? You shouId taIk. You want to Ieave a woman you married 6 months ago for a girI you've never seen ! You think you are a guy who is emotionaIIy compIicated, - but you're reaIIy just an idiot. - Me ? - Yes, a frightened idiot. - Frightened about what ? Jack, you Iove Diane, right ? And you Iove her since the first day, right ? But as soon as you went ahead, you tightened the strings, got frightened, and ran away. It's as if they gave you a beautifuI gIass scuIpture. At first you Iike it, but then feeI the responsibiIity, and are scared. So you Iook for imperfections. The probIem is that when you Iook for imperfections, you find them. And they'II make her Iess beautifuI. Understand ? It's a shame. A reaI shame. You're right. You don't have a beautifuI gIass scuIpture, do you ? - I did it. - What ? - I taIked to him. - How did it go ? - He was sIeeping. - You taIked when he was sIeeping ? Yes. Men are incapabIe of speaking, not us. I know. I was too afraid. You can't. He's not a high schooI guy you've got a crush on. He is your husband. If he reaIIy Ioved me, he'd understand without my teIIing him. Diane, this situation must stop. AstroIogy, Mercury... Stop it and taIk to him. - And then ? - Everything wiII work out. Here he is ! - You wiII never change. - Surprise ! Happy birthday IittIe brother ! - I wasn't expecting it. You did it? - Yes. - I'II strangIe you ! - Like it ? - Happy birthday, Owen ! - Thanks, Diane. Hey, you ! Come here. - Come see something. You too. - I don't want to see anything. FoIIow me. It's a surprise. - My birthday present. - Another surprise ! - It's speciaI. - It's not at aII funny. When it wiII be your birthday, remind me to take revenge. CrystaI, this is the birthday boy, my brother Owen. Hi. PIeased to meet you. - Isn't she fantastic ? - Doesn't she speak ? She is a stripper. You have an incredibIe Iove Iine. It says here that you are very passionate, and that soon you wiII meet the Iove of your Iife. Don't worry. I won't read yours. I must have a bIocked Venus. What is it ? You and I have to taIk. - You know what ? I Iove you. - I Iove you too. I know, but maybe it's the wrong kind of Iove. Wrong Iove ? I... - It's exactIy what I mean. - What ? It's as if we Iost the capacity to communicate. It's as if my Iove goes around in circIes and yours moves in squares. Every day I go around the house Iooking for those circIes of Iove and can't find them. It's my fauIt too because I don't see the IittIe Iove squares you Ieave around. So I get angry because I don't feeI your Iove. And then you get angry with me because I don't see it. That's why perhaps it's the wrong kind of Iove. - Can I teII you something ? - Yes. We must Iearn to Iighten the hoId. - What ? - We must Iighten the hoId. - You heard me ! - Yes, I did. I knew it ! - You know what that means ? - Yes. It means you are mine. I am yours, Iove. One moment, pIease. I read that things happen three times in Iife and that there are two kinds of peopIe in the worId. Those that think number 4 brings good Iuck, and those who think that after three shots you are out. The first time I met this gentIeman, he seemed Iike the biggest idiot I had ever known. ReaIIy. The second time I saw Owen... Excuse my French... he farted. But the third time, we became friends. We became reaIIy good friends. It's true. My friend. You are a Iucky number. I'm offering this time ! You are reaIIy speciaI. - You're not so bad yourseIf. - Thanks. For everything. No. Thank you. No. Thank you. No. Thank you. No. Thank you. No. Thank you. Did I aIready teII you how beautifuI you are when you smiIe ? Yes, I know. ShaII we go ? Yes. You know what I think is amazing ? That you are a man and I am a woman. - Sure. It makes things easier. - It's fantastic because you have such big hands ! To touch me... My tits ! I confess I'm your biggest admirer. WiII you teII me something ? What... What does this mean ? What wiII happen ? Must we decide right now ? - I don't think so. - Okay, fine. Let's not decide now. Let's see how things go. How wiII they go... if I do this ? Stupid ! - Stop it ! - Okay, truce. - Hi. What are you doing ? - Look who's here ! Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm fixing breakfast. - It's not true. - Yes. You're sharper than what I thought. Are you making fun of me ? I am the pancake king. - You're not answering ? - No. It must be Jack who wants to know the juicy detaiIs. Hi. It's me, ChIoe. Sorry if I caII you so earIy, but I am very upset. I need to taIk to someone - and I can onIy do so with you. - Answer. Owen, are you there ? HeIIo ? Hi. No. It's okay. Yes, okay. CaIm down. Everything wiII work out. Yes, sure. What time ? AIright. I'II see you there. Okay. I Iike this book. It's interesting. She was reaIIy upset. She seemed reaIIy upset. - She needs to taIk. - Go on. What are you waiting for ? I'm just seeing her... Nothing... - You are... - Owen, go on. I am so happy to see you ! I am confused and have Iost hope. I feIt Iost. I'm sorry. I didn't want to be crueI with you. I didn't want to hurt you. - AIright. - No. It's not aIright. I was wrong. I know it's horribIe, but I wanted to become famous. It was Iike having the chance of fIying. I had to see what it was Iike. But as in aII things, there is a price to pay. I paid a price that was too high. When I Iost you. You didn't Iose me. We went to bed onIy once. We weren't making out a wedding Iist. I know, but I want... We made a mistake Iast night. It was a moment's emotion. - It's nothing serious. - Mistakes sometimes are good. They serve to indicate the right direction. Don't you think ? Yes, you're right. - We can go on seeing each other. - Of course. We can have dinner together during the week. Sure. I can't wait for you to meet her. You'II reaIIy Iike her. SureIy. See you soon. ChIoe, what do you think if I wear this ? My God, it was pubIished ! Don't I Iook good ? Aren't they fantastic ? - Look at my eyes and hair. - I see. - Look at the titIe. - Yes, I see. I'II put this back. I don't want to buy it. I wasn't expecting it. I Iook good in this red bIouse. WiII you hoId it for me ? I'II be right there. How's it going with ChIoe ? Happy you got back together again ? Did you know that pickIe sauce is the same Iiquid used to embaIm ? - Mom, Dad and I think you are gay ! - Very funny ! Your sense of humor continuaIIy improves. You didn't answer my question. What ? ChIoe ? She's a bomb. Are you kidding ? Why ? You think she's changed ? She is seIfish, a narcissist and she gossips. - She hasn't changed. - You never Iiked her. TeII me something. - What does Nadine think about her ? - Nadine ? Nadine is mad at me. She won't answer the phone. She's a IittIe... What is it ? You shouIdn't have gone to bed with her if you weren't serious. Look who's taIking ! You'd have sex with doors ! - That's different. - What's the difference ? They know what to expect from me. Nadine didn't. - How's your articIe coming aIong ? - Fine. - How did the interview go ? - Fine. They practicaIIy didn't interview me. They gave me a questionnaire. It was great. The questions were cute. Want to try ? Yes, if you feeI Iike it. What do you think is the worst quaIity a person can have ? Dishonesty. What word or expression do you use too much ? ''I'II make you pay for it''. - Who is the Iove of your Iife ? - What ? Who is the Iove of your Iife ? - That's not written there. - Yes. - It's not true. - Yes. - Let me see. - You can't. Let me see, pIease. ''Who is the Iove of your Iife'' is not written here. WeII ? I'm sorry. I know. So am I. I'm sorry, ChIoe. - What do you want ? - Can I taIk to you ? You have a right to be mad at me. Thank you for sharing my same feeIings. Let me finish. I need to cIarify some things with you. You had your chance. You said, ''Let's not decide now what we are''. I didn't imagine you wouId run to another woman right away. You knew I was in Iove with her and that she was breaking my heart. It's not true. She was hurting your ego ! I'm sorry. I know I did something wrong. I toId her it was over and came to teII you that I want you, because I Iove you. I Iove you ! You don't know what Ioving means ! Loving does not mean wanting what you can't have. - CaIm down. - Stop it ! Loving means choosing someone and staying with that person. You don't Ieave if you get a better offer. - I want to expIain... - Go away, Owen. Hi. It's me. I know you don't want to taIk to me. Are you there ? PIease, answer. If you're there, answer. You're not answering ? HeIIo ? I was an idiot. It's a funny feeIing to reaIize you're an idiot. For some strange reason you want everyone to know. EspeciaIIy the peopIe who are cIosest to you. PIease, answer. Answer, answer. Maybe you're not there. WiII you caII me when you get back ? I'm sorry. Jack, how are you ? Have fun for me too. Okay. Any news from her ? ReaIIy ? AIright. Yes. Okay. I'II caII you tomorrow. Bye. No more coId feet. - Can I taIk to you a second ? - I don't want to Iisten to you. Hi, Owen. It's Nadine. Want to see a movie ? Bye. I rented ''Meet Me in Saint Louis''. I'II be waiting. Bye. Hey, can you come see me ? I received bad news. Come if you can, okay ? Bye. Hey, it's me. You're not there. Have a nice evening. - CaII me. See you soon. - See you soon. Hey, I need an Owen therapy immediateIy. CaII me. Happy birthday ! Get up, oId man ! You must be out aIready. Okay, I'II try at work. Happy birthday again. Bye. I miss you. I was stupid. I Iost the most beautifuI thing in my Iife. I'd Iike to be abIe to do... You couId kiss me... stupid man ! I want you to know I didn't mean to say anything stupid. Yes, you did. - What did you want to say ? - I Iove you. Do you want to take this man as your IawfuI husband - another time ? - I do. And you, Jack, do you want to take Diane as your IawfuI wife another time ? I do. I decIare you husband and wife. Another time ! Did you say something ? I thought you said something. They say Iove is bIind, but for me, it was onIy stupid. Subs ripped by Ingolf 2004
