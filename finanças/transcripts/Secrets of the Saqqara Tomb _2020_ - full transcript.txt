- Mr. Hamada! - Yes, boss? There's something down there. Hold on, Ghareeb, I'm coming down. It's over there. What are we looking at? Over there… something has appeared. My God, the dust! That's why I stopped. I can't tell what it is. It's in that pile of dirt. Okay, give me some room. In the name of God! What's this then? This is something astonishing… It's the lion goddess, Ghareeb! Wow! What in the name of God is this doing here? To discover a complete tomb… It is incredible. The first time I went in, I nearly passed out from sheer joy! Four thousand years old, hidden! Nobody touch it before. An unfathomable tomb! There is absolutely nothing like this. This tomb… is a unique tomb. To find this color… to find this inscription… and all these statues in a private tomb… It doesn't appear before in all Egypt. My name is Mohammad Mohammad Yousef. I am a doctor in Egyptology. From the beginning when we discover the tomb, we found the name Wahtye. Wahtye is the owner of the tomb. But we don't know anything about this man. We must read the hieroglyphics to find out… Who is Wahtye? Who is he to have a tomb like this? It is a mystery. Usually when we find a tomb, somebody digs the burial shaft in the ancient times. But sometimes you have a surprise. When we cleaned the ground, we found four shafts filled with sand. And that day, everybody didn't sleep. We dream. Because if we can find the whole family buried in the shafts after 4,500 years, that would be better than finding gold. It would be incredible for us. My name is Hamada Mansour. I'm an archaeologist and a member of the Egyptian mission at the Bubasteion necropolis. Mr. Ahmed Zikrey is my supervisor. He was also the person who taught me history in primary school. - You're late. - Sorry, boss. Every day, we start our journey… from the world of the living… to the world of the dead… Saqqara. Working at Saqqara, I'm so lucky, because I love the history so much. In just minutes, you can go from the green, and people, crowded… suddenly to be in the desert. It is amazing. Saqqara is a magical place. The secret of its enchantment is that under its sands are treasures dating back more than 5,000 years. All in the shadow of the Step Pyramid, the oldest stone pyramid in the world. For me, Saqqara is the most important archaeological site in Egypt. Any Egyptologist must come to Saqqara to learn the history from the beginning till the end. The Bubasteion necropolis, where we found Wahtye's tomb, is an ancient cemetery by the eastern cliffs, less than a kilometer from the Step Pyramid. We began our excavation here in the spring of 2018. The whole team is Egyptian… But it's tough to work in these conditions. If the weather down in the city is 26 degrees, it's 32 or 33 degrees up here. It's exhausting work… and, my God, the dust! But we are the people who can best give a voice to our ancestors, because they are our ancestors. We are one step closer to them than the foreigner. Mr. Sabry is the General Manager. He keeps the whole operation running. Him and his family practically live here! Foreman Mustafa is in charge of the workers. We'll put a group here, Foreman Mustafa. - Yes. - Group number one. And Dr. Mohammad Yousef is the site director. I admire his reputation as an archaeologist, so I always stick close in order to learn from him. Since we discovered the tomb, we are waiting to dig the shafts to complete our story for Wahtye and his family. But until this moment, we are not able to work inside the tomb. Because first we need to investigate the story of Wahtye through what is written on the walls. Let's start working around the frame. Around three months, we are waiting, but we haven't stopped working outside. Our main aim here is to find a new tomb. We discovered Wahtye, so maybe we will discover another tomb in this area. It is a theory. Maybe it's right, maybe it's not right. But we need to finish the work in this area before the end of the season. We have hundreds of people working at the mission. It is the only source of income for them. All the team hoping for next season. But everybody not sure that they come back again or no, because maybe no money from the government this time. We are sure we can find something, but the time is running. Ramadan is coming. So we need to find something to complete our work. What is it, Mahrous? Let me see. Have you got something? Move your hand, Mahrous, move your hand. - Hold it from the top! - Go, Tamer! Sweep. It is a base of a statue. "May Ptah give… all… all life… give all health… all life to…" The name here. The name, the beginning of the name, is not clear. I've got a feeling she is not human. It could be Sekhmet. We need the other part to read the rest. That would be good. - That's your job, Mr. Hamada. - Yes, boss! It's very beautiful! Dr. Mohammad, this statue is very unusual. We found the base first… then the body. It fits perfectly. We carried on working and we found the head. There are some beautiful statues here. We're close to where the temple was. This part is important. This is not. My dear, just a little bit this way. I really love these small cats. Small is beautiful, Mr. Ahmed. Humerus bone, there are two, and the radius… That's the radius there. Be careful with that mattock. What is it? Sekhmet? God willing! Wow, a great example! Words saying, "To Sekhmet, beloved of god Ptah, may he give her all the health and all the pleasure, like Ra forever." Beautiful. To be the first one to hold something in your hand after thousands of years… Millions of people dream to do this work. We are working here, but we are ready at any time to move quickly to work inside the tomb. We dream to finish the story of Wahtye. Who is this man? "Purified Priest to the King." Purified Priest to the King? Where's "the King?" "The King" is right there. Do you see it? But it's eroded. Yeah, you're right. - Can you see it now? - Yeah, exactly. Good point. When we are about to read a hieroglyphic text, there are certain rules that we follow. I think these are remnants of the symbol for "Divine Estate," - or is it just my imagination? - These are remnants of… - Of "Divine Estate." - Yes, it's "Divine Estate." The writing can go from right to left, left to right, from top to bottom, or even the opposite. After this horizontal row of hieroglyphs it's then this northern frame and these vertical inscriptions. So the whole idea is we figure out what direction it's going in. The simple trick is to look for the bird. If he faces right, we start from the right. If he faces left, we start from the left and then we're looking to see if we can make sense of it. I think it's "Revered with…" because this part is the rest of the phonetic symbol for "'Revered," which is these three together. - Followed by "the Great God." - Right, right. Okay, let's read it? This is very clear. Did you write that? Improve your handwriting a little for when you're reading. Improve your handwriting. I beg you! This is how I write. All geniuses are like that. - How can you read this? - I'm the only one who can. That's where the enjoyment comes from, every aspect we discuss will lift the veil on who Wahtye was. And as the basis of everything, we must consider Wahtye as a priest. The priest in that period was considered one of the highest officials. He was the middleman between the king and the people, and between the king and his god. That's how he was able to build such a wonderful tomb. Wahtye, based on my first impression… I like the guy! Even if I see him as a bit of an egoist. He mentioned his own name a lot in the tomb. And he put in a lot of statues of himself. Fifty-five statues is an immense number! He is glorifying himself. He wanted to say, "I am a strong personality, an important personality." He wanted to be transported to the afterlife in his full strength, with all of his wealth. He depicted an incredible array of activities. We have multiple scenes of daily life… and religious scenes… showing the afterlife. This whole thing is scenes, it's very nice. The scene is magnificent. He cared to portray everything in great detail. This man wanted it all. He wanted to transfer all of this to his afterlife, and he was saying, "I will be master of all this for eternity." Incredible! It is a special tomb… but in my own personal perspective, this tomb contains a lot of riddles. This is a family tomb, and there are certain characters that are shown, such as Wahtye and his mother, his four children, and his wife. But some characters are missing. He had a brother? Wahtye's name was mentioned so many times. What's the deal? It's as if he was saying, "This tomb is mine! This tomb is mine, mine, mine!" It's too much! I smell the scent of conspiracy in this tomb. My name is Foreman Mustafa Abdo Sadek Mahmoud. I am the foreman of excavations at Saqqara. I became a foreman because this is the work of my forefathers. My father, my grandfather, and my great grandfather were all foremen. It was passed down to me generation by generation. This is our land. I come here after I finish work. These trees and palms have been around since the time of the pharaohs. I plant and harvest just like the ancient Egyptians. There are many things on Wahtye's walls that I recognize from my daily life. People imagine the ancients living in the desert sands because that's where we find them now. But this is the Egypt where Wahtye lived… and he believed that he could take all this with him. So he spent his whole life preparing for his next life. The ancient Egyptians hoped that after death, they would live for eternity in the Field of Reeds, which was a lot like the Egypt they knew… only better. But to get there, they had to go through a series of tests in the underworld. The most important of these tests took place in the hall of judgment before Osiris, god of death and resurrection. To get to paradise, the person had to stand in front of 42 judges and swear that they had not committed certain sins. And so on. After that came "the weighing of the heart," where the person's heart was weighed against the feather of truth and justice. If the heart was heavier than the feather, it would be eaten by a crocodile-headed demon and the person was lost forever. But if the heart and feather were in balance, the person was declared "true of voice" and the journey to the Field of Reeds could begin. Okay, same time tomorrow, boss? Right, okay. Don't be late, boss! All the work that involves danger is my work, because, basically, I'm the only youthful one on the team. But I always liked difficult things, not easy ones. The Bubasteion necropolis, I must say… is a very strange place. It always gives us what we aren't expecting… And that's a wonderful thing. Hey, Ghareeb! In the name of God! - What are all these, Ghareeb? - It's a strange thing! In the name of God! No, no, no… What's this? They're still in their wrappings. Look at this lovely piece here, Ghareeb. This fellow I see before me now is a… cat! - See how many there are, Ghareeb? - Yeah. So many! Are these all cats? - Where did they get them from? - I swear I have no idea. But there are so many cats, it's really shocking. Hello! What's this, then? Is this supposed to be a cat, Ghareeb? Well, look! Oh, my days! In the name of God! This is no cat, Ghareeb! Let's take it into the light. - This is something… - Something astonishing. Is there any cat this size, Ghareeb? It's as big as my nose! Oh, my days! Flip it over. Flip it gently. Hello! Look! The mouth, it's drawn! And the eyes and nose… and the ears too. Masterpiece! Do we have any creature in our country remotely like this? Nope. If you had a cat this big, what would you do with it? I'd scare the kids with it! Could this be a cat? - Where will we put all these, Ghareeb? - I don't know. - And they're all cats? - No, no, no. Praise God, man. This is not a cat. Is it a mongoose? Look at its tail! Its shape, Ghareeb. This is a crocodile, boss. Ghareeb, take this and put it aside for me. Sure. Because this is something else, all on its own. This is a crocodile mummy, boss. I think we're done, Ghareeb. We're going to take them out and get ourselves some fresh air. Send us a crate on two hooks! I want to tell you something, ever since I started working in this cat necropolis… when cats see me around my house, they run. They're afraid of me! They don't act like pets towards me like they used to. But when a cat runs, I say to her, "Well, you have the right. I just took your ancestors out of the ground… and put them in storage." She's scared I'll do the same thing to her! Ah, this one is lovely. It's a beautiful bronze head! How's it going? Like anyone else, I've seen cats of many sizes. But a cat that's absolutely massive like this? I've never seen that before. We need to get the bones tested to see what it is. The evidence… that this tomb contains a riddle is substantial. Oh my, what is this? Fabulous! Look, Nermeen. There's no other engraving like this in the tomb. Next to the first false door, there is a scene of an offering table… with the owner sitting in front of a beautiful lady. I see a few unusual things. - All of this is unusual. - Right? All of it is unusual, I swear. Usually, it would be the man and his wife. So we expected it would be Wahtye and his wife, Ptah-Weret. But when we read the inscription… it says, "His wife, Merit-Min." We were standing there… in astonishment. Because Merit-Min… was his mother! So we started thinking, "Did he marry his mother?" Of course that conflicts. It's impossible! The names… the names have been changed. - I think they've been tampered with. - He replaced them. The names had been scraped off. Anyone who runs their hand along the wall would say, "No, something was afoot here." It isn't Wahtye. The entire tomb is Wahtye, Wahtye, Wahtye. - Here is something different. - Is he a thief then? He's a thief! Holy crap. Is that all? No! The main statue itself! Looking at the features of that statue… This statue is different. It doesn't look like any other statue in the tomb. It's clearly a different person than the others in the tomb. Which makes me even more convinced that a conspiracy took place here. I think that Wahtye seized this tomb and that it wasn't meant for Wahtye at the beginning. Who is the victim? The victim is unknown. But we have a theory. Yeah. We have a bunch of clues. There is mention of a brother. Wahtye's brother. He's mentioned in the eastern wall. Wahtye dedicates a song… But why didn't he mention his name? I think the dedication of the song is to assuage his conscience… - He feels guilty... - He's feeling guilty! - So, this man isn't Wahtye? - No, it isn't Wahtye. But it could be his brother. All of these clues… suggest that Wahtye seized this tomb from his brother. So if Wahtye did steal his brother's tomb… will he be punished in the other world? No, I think he had a plan. On the last wall we recorded in the tomb, which was the southern wall, we found a very large text that says… So he was placing himself in the ranks of those who judge, so that he can personally absolve himself of this sin. So it seems he really was convinced that he would evade punishment and get to the afterlife. But there are answers no one could provide but Wahtye himself. As for the burial shafts, there may yet be a discovery that answers all the questions and all the riddles in Wahtye's tomb. That is unbelievable! It's so big, I can't imagine there was ever a cat of this size. This is the biggest cat mummy we have ever found. Ah! I see a mustache. Like Hamada! Yes, like Hamada. On the heads of other cat mummies, there might be a scarab up here. And there is even this section… - which exposes the fur. - You can see fur! You can see fur… what remains of it. Golden yellow… such a beautiful color. It can't be, it can't be. All good? That's the head. Can you zoom in? So you can see it's a baby… because these teeth are still mostly up inside the gums. The teeth have only just started growing down. Okay, go down. Carry on down. Look at the backbone. This is definitely a baby. You're sure? This is the first time in the known history of mummification - that we have a lion here in Saqqara! - A mummified lion! I hope so! I will tell Ghareeb, "It's a baby lion, not a cat, Ghareeb!" There will definitely be a reward for the team. This area was coming down, so we've stabilized it. That's great. Brilliant. Yeah. We've been waiting so long, we just want to get on with it. You can start then. Since the first day we entered the tomb… I'd been staring at the sand in the shafts… Go give word to the workers. …wondering what we'll find down there. Wahtye, his secrets, his riddles, are they finished? I come in daily hoping, "Dear God, please let us work inside Wahtye today." I was going to lose my mind! Listen up, men! Yes, Foreman! We're ready to start working down in the tomb. The restoration is complete and it's all been secured for you. We need hard work and tough men! Do you understand? Then let's go! Put those down here. We'll start with this shaft and the one Ghareeb is standing in. In the name of Allah and may God bless us. Make a chain. You stay here. Carry it over your shoulder and take it outside. Pick up any shards. Any fragments, pick them up, Ghareeb. Sometimes, when workmen working… you feel that you go back many centuries during the time of ancient Egypt. You work with the same materials which the ancient Egyptians used. Sometimes, we discover the same baskets used by ancient Egyptians. Sometimes we discover a chisel… like a small chisel which we use until now. So it's continuation. Life goes in the same direction. - Mr. Ahmed! - Yes, Osama? - There's something here. - What is it? Oh, yes! It looks like a wooden coffin. The head is pointing to the west. Let's just expose the feet and move this way as we go. Osama, you have to be very careful here. Something beautiful. A wonderful coffin! This is the best coffin we've found in this condition. Slowly, slowly. What's happened here, Ashraf? It looks like it's burnt. Why would it look burnt? It could be the natron used in mummification that caused that. So some sort of… chemical reaction has occurred? A female, I think. The bottom half isn't as badly affected, but it's good linen. The idea of mummifying the body is said to have been influenced by the story of Osiris and Isis… which had a profound effect on the way the ancient Egyptians treated their dead. Isis and Osiris were brother and sister. Osiris was ruling the world until his brother Seth murdered him and cut him into pieces that were spread across the lands of Egypt. Isis was a magician. She went around Egypt collecting his pieces, binding them together with linen in the first act of mummification. Through this, she brought him back to life and had their son Horus. Horus grew up to avenge his father's murder and rule Egypt as king of life on Earth. Osiris became king of the underworld and the god of death and resurrection. That conviction in the power of mummification to transcend death… was right at the heart of ancient Egyptian belief. Get Dr. Mohammad and tell him the foreman needs him. Mr. Ahmed! - This came from down there? - Yes, Mr. Ahmed. - And these bones too? - Yeah, the loose bone too. Look, boss, this is very disappointing. The shaft has bottomed out already. Only 60 centimeters deep. That's it. I am Ghareeb Ali Mohammed Abushousha. I work as a digger. I've been working here since long ago. My father worked here before me. Thirty or forty… maybe fifty years ago. When I'm working, all my thoughts are about what's in front of me. It's not just mindless digging, no. When you're holding the mattock, you have to have some sense. Are you going to find something? You have to be prepared. You could come across a mummy, a bone, a fragment of something. You have to be ready for that. A novice will end up breaking the thing. Mahmoud! Mahmoud, come here! Sit down here, Mahmoud, sit here. Sit beside me. Have some tea. This is Mahmoud, my son. I brought him here to learn the ropes. So when the foreman needs him to work, he'll have experience. If he stayed at home, he'd learn nothing. Then I wouldn't be happy. My happiness is having him here with me. What can you see? There's a wall here, I think, a mudbrick wall. On which side? - On the eastern side. - The eastern side? Isn't it a bit strange, east? It should be west. - Are you joking, Ghareeb? - I swear, I'm serious. Be careful, his eyesight is bad and it worries me. I don't trust him! Be careful, watch out. If it turns out you're winding me up, Ghareeb… It's all good. Unbelievable! It really is a wall. It reminds me of the wall blocking Wahtye's tomb. So it turns out that what I said was true? Yes, and I have a big reward for you! Fine. - There is something wooden. - What? Something wooden has started to appear. About three centimeters of something wood. What I can see now is that… there's a lid. It's a great feeling… taking apart something from more than 4,000 years ago. The first hand to touch it after the ancient Egyptian who sealed it. For that to be your hand is something truly phenomenal. It's strange how well-sealed it is! The person who sealed it is saying, "Nobody come near it, nobody even get close to it." Peace be upon you! - How's it going? - All good. Thank God. Hamada is performing a heroic deed down there. This space is tight and hot and really terrible! But you're the first hand to open the blockage, Hamada, come on! It's my only consolation, frankly. Take a look, Hamada. What is that? Is that mud or what? Yeah, mud. That's because of the water. When rain seeped through the ceiling cracks, it brought dirt with it, which will have filled up the coffin too. So it'll be impossible to get it out in one piece. No, it'll come out intact. That's impossible! Get that block on the left first. - That one? - To make room for yourself. Yes, yes. I told you not to touch that. I didn't touch anything. I didn't even come close! Look, in front of him, it's like a concrete wall. It was compressed after it filled in the space. It's all solid, boss. The coffin is full of mud and it's packed tight. - And there's a skeleton inside! - Thank God! Boss, I'll collect the bones. Unbelievable… We've waited so long to know anything about him. Pass the wood up. Look, only 32 centimeters. It must be for a young child. Hey, Doctor! - Check this out. - That's a molar. Working at the site, it's a naturally morbid place. They're teeth. - You're in the world of the dead. - It's even rotten. Child burials in particular. I mean, my heart breaks when I see the remains of a child. These teeth have come from the mummy down there. - They're molars, but they're very small. - How old? More like 14, 15… something like that. We thought that it is a child… but not just one. It is more than one child. We collect all these bones, and we ask our anthropologist who comes and investigates these bones for us. According to the reliefs in the tomb, we have Wahtye, and his mother, and his wife, and his four children. We have, now, three children. So we start to search for the other part from the family. All right, obviously, this shaft is done. Now it'll be easier for the workers to work over here. Come on, Hashem, we're going to work in this shaft. What have you found? Beautiful, beautiful. What's this beauty? The box, Mr. Ahmed? Yes, a very beautiful box, Foreman Mustafa. That's a unique piece, Mr. Ahmed. Is it a game, Mr. Ahmed? Yeah, Senet. It's a bit like chess. Wow. These people were so cool to play chess. Look what's inside. This is bone. Must've had a function in the game. Look, we can arrange them like this and play, you and I, Mr. Ahmed. …14, 15, 17… - …19. - These are bones. They look like vertebrae. - Where do the bones go? - I don't know. No one knows how to arrange them. Put them all next to each other. Mr. Sabry! What's up, Osama? Foreman, there's a hole in the cliff! Mr. Sabry! Have you got a flashlight? Mahdi, get a flashlight! Faster, Mahdi! There's a skull. That's two, three skulls. Looks like a stack of burials inside. Look, boss. Look, there's something beautiful here. - Where? - Right there! Look, see? It's there! Looks like a hollow of around three meters. I think… this hole is from around 13th and the 12th century BC. We now clean this to see where's the entrance of this hole, because it must be in this area. Let's bring it all down. Give me your hand, Osama. Very beautiful, Dr. Mohammad! Clear a path. It is a burial chamber. We discover in it some wooden coffins …and some bones. I think there's another entrance here, Dr. Mohammad. And we also find another hole. There's a big cavity in here. Dr. Mustafa comes and we start to find the coffin, wooden coffin. Let's go! One… two… three! Lift, Hamada! The colors are beautiful, God bless. Gather your strength, you lot! Put your backs into it! Move it straight away! Come on, lift! Lift, boy, lift! Easy, easy! Stay with them, Ashraf! - Dr. Mohammad? - Yes? There are bones here. - What's that? - A skull. Is it just a skull on its own? Not part of a burial or anything? All right, look, Osama. Grab that! Look out, Osama. There's a head… - A skull? - Yeah. All the bones are piled in this corner. I think it's more than one person. This shaft is strange for us. We didn't find a burial chamber in this shaft. It's just two meters and stop. But we find the remains of two skeletons. It looks like it's standing because the bones goes… from top to bottom. There are things that are turned over, but they're small as well. Why these people buried this way? Why they didn't make a coffin for each one? I think they are buried quickly in this shaft. I mean, it's been crammed in here. Could be something happened to the family of Wahtye. So, in shaft number three? - Two women. - Two women. About how old? One is over 50. Probably his mother then. And the other one, you can say she was in her thirties from the wear on the teeth. It might be the wife. All right, Doctor. Anything else with them? Yes, a child's bones. The age isn't very clear. Bones of child, age unknown. Really, a fourth child? Maybe so. Ahmed, we have four children. - Are there four on the walls? - Yes, there are four. Three boys and a girl. The three boys might have been in that shaft, and here, the two ladies with the girl. So they buried the females together? The girl with the mother and the wife. It's a good theory. Wahtye's life, it was complicated. What happened for his family? Died at the same time? Or one by one? Why they died so early like this? I can't imagine myself. I'm so lucky. I have three daughters and one son. Rawda, the smallest one… Four years. I love her so much. I think if I lost my son or daughters… I put myself instead of him… I can't believe. It's very, very sad. To lose the whole family? It's terrible. I think there's some tragedy in the last part of life of Wahtye. But how? We don't know at this time. So we still have puzzle. We need to find Wahtye to work this out. And there's only one place left to look. - Put your back into it! - Yes, Doctor! Whatever shaft you go into, you jinx it! You should read some of the Qur'an in the morning! I did, Doctor! We'll see. Ghareeb, I like you, but you're jinxing the whole thing for us! No, Doctor! I don't know what to say. - If you'd taken more care of your men... - Take more care than this? Should I buy them chocolates? God will deal with you, Mustafa. Look, Mr. Sabry, the limestone is great. This breakage is old. Broken from long ago. See? It's the upper part of a beautiful stone statue. - Yes, very beautiful. - And the wig is wonderful. The details are amazing. - Mr. Ahmed. What's this beauty? - Hey, boss! I sent for you immediately. You know the reliefs that we found a few days ago? - The King Rameses II ones? - Surely it's no coincidence? Yes. They're from a chapel above, I think. It's broken this way. I wonder, Ahmed… Remember those two pieces of statue that we found? - In the first season? - Part in the first and part in second. Do you think this might fit with them? Yeah, boss, I hope so. Look, Dr. Medhat. Remember the statue from last season? - That was in several pieces? - In two pieces… - We've put them together! - You have? Where is it? Come, have a look. God bless you! Can we check that piece? Bring it over, Mr. Ahmed. This is the part we found last May at the top of the site. And this one, we found in October at the base of a shaft at the bottom. Give it to Dr. Ashraf. Look, look. Move back, move back. Go lower. Just give me a second. No, go back up a bit. - Hold it! No, hold it! - Let go! It's standing alone… Now support it! Perfect! Perfect! - All right. - As soon as I saw it, I knew it would fit. Beautiful. Very beautiful. Thank God our brains are still working well. - How's it going? - All good, boss! There's a gap here. What do you have there? Move the debris to the south. Be gentle. - Easy, easy! - Hold on, hold on. Mr. Hamada will come down now. When we go down to the bottom of a shaft… particularly the shafts in Wahtye's tomb, we know that the rock is weak. To me, this is the door to paradise. I want to see him. I want to get closer to him. I see an opening to the west in front of me. The width of the opening is equal to the width of the shaft. - About a meter? - It's the same, yeah. Now the entrance has widened, right? - Yes. - Easier to see now? - Yes. - What can you see? One second. I'll make sure before I get too excited. - What? - Just give me a second. It's Wahtye, manager! Wahtye! We've found him! Thank God! What have you got down there? Tell me! - A wooden coffin! - Finally we found Wahtye! - Great, great! - Thank God! Congratulations, boss! A thousand congratulations, Hamada! This will be the first time he sees light. You're lucky, Mr. Hamada. Very lucky! You're the first person to see the burial from the chamber. You're the first person to see Wahtye. - Dr. Mohammad! - Yes, boss? The skeleton of Wahtye is in here. Great. - I've found the skull. - Thank God. - Mr. Hamada? - Yes? - Are all the bones there? - Yes, all of them. Thank God. It's so curious that in all the extravagance of this tomb, now that we've cleared the shafts, there are only two burial chambers. And this main shaft only has… a simple wooden coffin. The story of this man still holds more riddles. I think any father who loses his children is left with a scar inside them. But we felt his statues portray a sense of cheerfulness. So maybe the tomb was already finished before his children died. Because the only place I sensed true sadness was in his burial chamber. There were no signs of luxury or indulgence. The coffin was just regular wood, and he wasn't even mummified that well. Maybe the shock of his children's death brought him to this. - Manager! - Yes, boss! The face of Wahtye! - Yes? - It's right in front of me. - Wahtye has finally made an appearance! - Wonderful! In very good condition. Thank God. We thought all would become clear when we found the burial chamber, but there is more to discover. We still need to find out how he died, but it's something very beautiful which fills your heart with joy… to reveal the face of Wahtye. Breathe a sigh of relief and say, we've reached Wahtye. Here is the tomb and there's its owner. Now the picture is complete. Has he arrived safely? - He's arrived. - Thank God! Thank Allah. Thanks be to Allah alone… God's mercy is for the merciful. Be merciful to those who walk the earth. It is one of the rare examples, to find all the people who are depicted in the walls in the tomb are buried in the shafts in the tomb. And this worldly life is but play and folly… We thank our God for this full story about this family. Wahtye is pleased of us, and we are pleased of Wahtye. It is a communication. It's cooperation. We made Wahtye famous after 4,500 years. So, if Wahtye comes now, he thanks us because of what we did for him. But we thank Wahtye, because without Wahtye, our work would very quickly be forgotten. Usually, in the last week of the work, you try to secure the site and save it. Come on Ghareeb, help him. Sometimes, you have a surprise. The cliff face looks good here. Because, when you clean some place… Get a mattock quick, hurry up! …sometimes you discover something important. Where are the empty buckets? Come on! Grab that one by your feet! Come around this way, Doctor. "To-Bi-Mis…" "To-Bi… Ben To-Bi-Mis." "Ben… Ben To-Bi-Mis." Look, "Judge," "The Great Judge." The Bubasteion necropolis, I must say… is a very strange place. It always gives us what we aren't expecting… and that's a wonderful thing.
