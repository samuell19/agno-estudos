It was on an evening in May 1945, the last spring of the war. I'd just received my second drink... Or it could have been the third. I'd had a minor success with a novel, so it had to be celebrated. Maybe you're wondering who I am... But what does a name reveal? In this story, I'm the "friend". Say, where can I buy cigarettes? At the bar. Did I say "friend" in this story? I could have also said... "The fool in the jigsaw puzzle." Because it was a jigsaw puzzle. A few pieces without meaning or connection... ... that were difficult to place. Hello there, Ragnar. Don't recognize me anymore? Of course...! How are you? Sit down. Waiter...! No thanks, I'm OK. I'll just have a packet of Philip Morris thanks. It's been a long time! What are you doing here? We're staying here at the hotel... my wife and I. You're staying here? How are Frida and little Pil? We broke up. Oh, I see. So you're here with a new wife? Not really. You could say... You could say that... I'm a bit... What is it, Martin? What's wrong? Nothing at all... ...except for the odd dizzy spell. Mild hysteria, that's all. Ridiculous, eh? Not something I'd imagine YOU suffering from. You were a mummy's boy who did well at school ...and had money from his parents. Sorry, I didn't mean that. True, I was a mummy's boy. You defined me well. It all happened disastrously. Your memory may fail you sometimes... ...but there are some things you can never forget. No. It's weird. What does this all mean for you? Nothing. At most, a break in your pleasant evening. Don't talk like that, Martin. You wrong us both and it sounds stupid. Your cigarettes... Thank you very much. I won't bother you any longer. Shall I give your regards...? ...to my wife? How? What do you mean? You know her. Really? Not well... slightly. What's her name? Ruth. I see, so you're back with her. It's remarkable. Miracles can still happen. You could say that about you. Goodbye. Arne! The lift. - Can you call me a cab? - Certainly, Mr Grande. Ring for a taxi for Mr Grande. My evening was ruined. Can I pay now? Everyone has a junk room in their subconscious... ...where you toss in all your unpleasant memories. Martin had opened the door of that junk room... ...and out crept one hideous memory after another, hesitantly. Yes, the evening was ruined. Excuse me, have Mr Grande and his wife left? No, there's a taxi waiting for them outside. - What room do they have? - 212. Hey! You ordered a taxi... How long am I supposed to wait? Just a moment... Get me room 212. Where's 212? Down there... first door on the right. Martin? Give me that razor, you idiot! Reception! Reception! Ring an ambulance! Mr Grande has... He's ill. What? Damn the taxi! Call an ambulance now! Why did you and Frida separate? She'd forgiven you, hadn't she? That was just it... She HAD forgiven me. Those sort of heroics are hateful. She threw up a concrete wall around herself. It could also have been the other way around. It could've, yes. But it simply didn't work. The poison was already in me. Ruth? Yes. So you went back to her? It was the only way out. When I approached her, she said she'd been waiting for me. She was delighted. We were ridiculously happy. Can you understand that? Why did she leave you at the hotel that night? Is it not something you want to talk about? You must be tired. Maybe we've talked too much. Goodbye for now, Martin. How's Martin going? Pretty good. But best you don't see him. He needs peace and quiet. Anyway, you wouldn't be allowed in. Were you with him tonight? He would've told you a lot of stuff about US. Yes... Quite a bit. I thought so. This time I finished it. That's why he wanted to end his life. I gathered that. You don't say! Coming up with me? I'm going home to sleep. You're afraid... Poor old Ragnar! I just wanted to show you something. Something exciting. Come on! Do you have a light? So, what's this exciting thing you wanted to show me? Come over here. Look down there. Who is that? The Devil. Is this him? Really? So there's a devil in this story, too. Isn't there in most of them? Why did you leave Martin at the hotel? Curious? Don't think for a moment that I'll tell you. However... I will tell you something else. A fairy-tale. The story of the three chimney sweeps and the changing of the guard. It's nice to march along like this, to music. I ought bring my trumpet to play while we work. Spring is in the air. I still think it's cold. The roofs are so slippery in winter. It's like playing in the band. You get out of the rut. Svensson, our poet! I'm just talking about a poetic life. With me, all sorts of things can happen out of the blue. I have to get started here. We'll see you at the rehearsal tonight. Toodle-oo! Does it need sweeping here, Ma'am? I think so, yes. Come on in. I do not live here. I just use my mother's bath. She's out in the country, picking apples. Really? So whereabouts is the kitchen? The kitchen's over there. You take good care, do you? I certainly take good care of myself! That's good. I was just going to take a bath. Really? Well you just go and jump in. Would you like a glass of milk? Milk. No... never touch the stuff. Would you prefer a beer? That sounds a lot better. What do you think you're doing? It's such lovely weather. Leave my bum out of it. I couldn't help myself. - There you are. - Thanks very much. Tell me... Are you just as black all over your body? Not as much as my face. I don't believe that for a moment! Don't you? I'll show you. No thanks... Some other time. Some other time? Listen...! I can play the trumpet. Well, you're a curious chimney-sweep! And what else? I can do a lot of things. But I'm married. Oh? Is she pretty? Not bad. But not as pretty as you. Would you like some tickets for the concert on St Lucia's Day? How nice of you! Thanks. Are you playing Lucia? Me? No... I'm going to play the most beautiful trumpet solo of my life. I think everything strong is beautiful. Sometimes when I blow my trumpet... ...then I feel like I'm the wind blowing. - That's beautiful. - Think so? What kind of work... ...do you do? Anything and everything. - Such as? - I paint. Really? Then we both do more or less the same thing. Yeah... I guess you could say that. Well, I guess I'm done with the kitchen. So... It's best that I... ...take a look at the roof then. Hey...! Can I come with you? Onto the roof? You'd fall off in no time. No...! It'd be more likely you. Drink your beer while I put something on. A museum. Anyway, you look damn pretty! I agree. What are you laughing at? Is this something you painted? Doesn't look natural. Rather crazy. It has something... The same is true for you. But it sure does seem crazy. It IS crazy. Yes it is. So are we going up on the roof? - If that's what you want. - Come on! Are you finished? Sure am! - Come over here. - I'm coming. - You're petty crazy yourself. - But you're happy. - Right. You have nice eyes... Otherwise, you're ugly. But it doesn't matter when your face is so sooty. And I think you're strong. Strong, yes... feel me. If you keep staring like that, I'll overbalance. I've got to go play somewhere else. All right, let's go then. Be careful here Hold that ladder tight. You can count on that. You're really strong. I guess I'll come back for the rest! No, my mother will be back. - So nothing was can do about it? - No, that's right. Thanks, I'm sooty enough already. Another reason to take a bath. Hell's bells... what a day! That was the fairy-tale. A devil in a bowler hat... ...and a trumpet-playing sweep. Hard-to-place jigsaw pieces. But I'll let this story here speak for itself, for the time being. Why not from the beginning...? ...at a cosy family lunch at Martin's parents'. Do you really mean that, Pil? I want a cake, Mummy! You have to finish your meal first. I want a cake now! Signe, come here with those cakes. You get a tasty cake from Grandma. He shouldn't. Say thanks to Grandma. Thanks, you old bag! Children always tell the truth. Surprisingly. I don't know where he got this from. That's easy to guess. That's not fair. I'm innocent. You can't say that to Grandma. - You're an old bag too! - Pil! Stop this nonsense, Pil! It's the stubborn phase. Not at all! He only plays up like this when he's here. - What do you mean? - Calm down, Martin! Mum spoils Pil far too much. No... you just be quiet! Would you rather I left the table? Do I spoil Pil too much? No, not at all! Martin is just out of sorts about his exam. I'm not at all out of sorts. Do you remember what you said, after Pil spent 3 days at Grandma's? This is what you said... You said she was tough on me and loving to Pil. It's scandalous... ...how mean and selfish young people are today. After all we've done. Anna, calm down. You eat our bread and take it for granted. But you shouldn't. Our patience has limits, Frida. You needn't come here for our sake. You don't know what you're saying, Mum. If Dad and I are weren't here, maybe I'd understand. Mummy... please! You shouldn't have said that. Anna, sweetheart! You're beastly, Martin! Can I help it if Mum's nutty? You should have had more sense. Not only that, you betrayed me. - Are YOU mad at me now? - Yes I am. I'm always trying to keep the peace between them and us... ...and then you go and repeat silly things I shouldn't have said. Really?! - You don't stand by what you said? - No, I don't! You're an idiot! So you'll start blubbering as well! If you cared about me at all, you wouldn't have said anything. I AM fond of you! Frida...! I love you! Let go of me! I agree with you. I mean, about what you just said. What on earth made me stuff up again?! Listen... Weâ€™ll buy her some flowers... That'll make her happy. Come and we'll buy some flowers for Mummy. Take that with you. Come on. Come on! - How much? - Five. - Should we deliver them? - No, I'll take them myself. Do you have any lilies of the valley? Certainly. I'll be right with you. Your change. Thank you. I have some lovely ones. How many do you want? This is all we have at the moment. Oh, no, my heel! I've got a car... I can drive you home. You don't think I did it on purpose? How ever would I know? All right then. Shall we go? Well, we didn't go far. No, not far. What a funny number for a car. 30070 Easy to remember. Daddy, you forgot Mummy's flowers. You went out to buy flowers for your wife. Yes. Lilies of the valley. A lily-of-the-valley marriage? Thanks for the lift. So you're here finally. Yes, we are. Turn around, Frida. Look at your repentant boys... ..who won't be happy before you say... ...that you forgive us and love us. You're not looking unhappy as it is. - Here are some flowers for you, Mummy. - Thank you, Pil. That's why we weren't home earlier. Come and I'll help you with your coat, Pil. Can't Pil do it by himself yet? Hey...! I love your cute nose. Why do I always get so angry? I'm going to be awfully nice. I'll do the dishes. Are you feeling alright? Then you can help me with the silverware. You are so sweet. - That's no reason to cry. - Yes it is! I was here alone thinking about what nasty things I'd say to you. Tell Ne what they were. It wouldn't be funny. Say something else. Put these weeds in a vase while I fix us some food. - Goodbye, Ragnarius. - I'll see you at college tonight. Hey, get out of my car! You should've locked it. Yes, I know. But get out. Some idiot there is staring at us. Can't we do this inside? He's a friend of mine. He's coming home with me. - Really? - Cute. I've changed my mind. See you. What'll I do with her? - Do you know her? - No. Not really. I met her once, in a shop, when I was with Pil. Drive around with her for a bit. It might be fun. 'Bye. Well, we can't stay here. We can't? Where are you going? Nowhere. You're going to really hate me. I recognized your licence plate and wanted to play a joke with you. But you just get angry. That's me all over. It was silly of me. Forgive me. I'm well aware of your kind. Your type always makes waves. Like at the florist. That with that heel wasn't on purpose. It really wasn't. It doesn't matter. I don't want to get involved with you. I know your name. You're Martin Grande and you live in Appelviken. You're going for your BA in autumn... ...and have been married to a Frida for 3 years. She fell pregnant, so you had to marry her. Very interesting. I was just lying. I've waited several times when you had lectures. Today you forgot to lock your car, so I hopped in. It made me so happy. I'm also happy because I know you want to be alone with me. How did you get my name? Via your licence plate. Let's be sensible. What's your name? Ruth. We have to be damned sensible. Nobody can know there's anything between us. We mustn't hurt anyone. I'm married, I'm happy, I love my wife. And you don't love me? No, not in the slightest. I hate you. Maybe I'll go to bed with you. That's being cold. Don't expect anything else. I don't want anything else. For now. I live alone. I paint. My mum lives over in Ostermalm. Her mind's going a bit. She has a lover who's the devil incarnate. - Sounds horrible. - Yes, it's horrible. I talk about them sometimes, but damn them. Drive me home now... But you can't come up. I'll see you at my place on Monday evening at 7. Fifth floor. Ruth Koler. I'm not coming. We'll see about that on Monday. No, won't be coming. Martin... Let's go to the movies with Frida. There are a lot of films opening on Monday. Frida has to stay with Pil. Of course... I didn't think of that. Frida...! What's up? I'm giving Pil a bath. Ragnar forgot he had to meet someone at 7 o'clock. I'm taking him in to town. We'll be back later. I thought I'd see a film in the meantime. How nice! So I'm left here alone with Pil. We should be back soon. Ragnar...! Can't you ring and say you can't make it? I guess I could. You're always late for your appointments. Let's go, otherwise we'll be late. It seems like you're more keen to leave than Ragnar is. I don't want to be late for the film. We'll be back in time for tea. Ragnar... Where are you going? I'm meeting with my brother.. Strange thing to forget about. I'll go and get the car. We'll be back soon. Maybe I'll be gone. That would certainly upset Martin. Think so? Definitely. See you soon. Come on, Pil. So what are we doing now? You go see the film. I'll pick you up again at nine o'clock. Can you describe her to me? Tell me what she looks like. I can't remember her... her face, I mean. I remember everything else... Shoulders, bust, hips, waist... ...arms, legs, wrists, fingers... But without a face. She was wearing a coat. How could you know all that? You're right there. I must have imagined it. What are you doing here? I followed you. So... spying on me! Martin... She wasn't there, but I'll get to her sooner or later. Don't do something that you'll regret. Thanks for the thought. I'll think about it. You're obsessed, Martin. You're not coping. We have to do something before it's too late. Maybe it's already too late. - You didn't come. - I came. - Yes, late. - I couldn't come sooner. You're lying... You thought you'd keep me waiting. So I punished you. I've been searching, calling, writing. Where have you been? On the moon. So you've been looking for me? You know I have. If we could get together... It won't happen... I don't care for you any longer! - Stop laughing! - You look funny when you're mad! - Listen to me! - I'm listening. - I'm serious. - I'm serious too. You can't hit me. But come to me tonight. And tomorrow night. And all the nights and days after that. I'll wait for you... I'll wait for you! Silly boy, not here! My insignia! Nice... Beautiful model. You have good taste. You must be expecting someone. You think so? It's a bit heavy with the perfume, my girl. You reckon? Maybe HE likes it? Which "HE"? Any "HE"! It's nothing. It might become something. How many men have you actually had? None of your business, Mummy! I could ask you the same thing. Do you enjoy it? Do YOU? No, I don't think it's nice. That's just because you're getting old. You cheeky girl! Tell me about the man you're seeing tonight. Well, he's quite young. You sound like you're in love. That's possible. Would you marry him? No, he's married already. You have to be really nasty to him. Why would I do that? I don't have that experience. You don't treat Viktor very well. How I treat Viktor? Don't be ridiculous. His portrait looks different here. Yes, and what's wrong with that? Nothing. By the way, have you seen Viktor lately? He doesn't come here any more. Since when? You have a horrible imagination. That Viktor of yours is also horrible... To me. Anyway, stay out of my business. My dear child... You know how that is with old wounds. You can never stop touching them. Do you understand? Just leave me out of it. I'm not trying to be nasty. Really?! I was only wondering if you needed money. I always need it. So I imagine. So I'm not going to see you supported my a man? I'm not going to prostitute myself, like some others. I think it's time I left... ...before I get angry... My little pet. The door's open. And then... Then there was a most extravagant feast. A veritable banquet... A night without end. So big... ...I could wrap it round my little finger... And so small... ...that the universe vanished in seconds. I was in the darkest of darknesses... ...and felt a bony hand. I thought it was the hand of death, and burst out laughing. I was in a light so hot and powerful... ...that I felt like a moth over a candle on an autumn evening. The feast was so grand... ...it could barely fit in that little room in Ostermalm. It was so great that it rose up through the roof... ...squeezed through the stars... ...and burst into a thousand pieces. Good morning. Soldier 1547 45/38 R. Ekberg? - That time arrived? - Sure has. Another guy just got back after 4 months in the beautiful north. 20 km from anything in skirts. See you. Yeah, I'm coming. Well, hi there, Frida! Yeah... um... Martin stayed with me, yes. It's just that it was a bit late. He as well. The postman's just been with the news. Now we'll be stuck for a while... somewhere in Sweden Yes... um... He's just popped out to buy cigarettes, I think... I'm not sure if he's coming back here or going straight home. Ragnar... Don't say I'm being silly... ...but Martin has been acting very strangely lately. Have you noticed that? Maybe that's it. But you have to realise... ...that I don't have anyone else besides him. Goodness me... Martin is head over heels in love with you! We me have our vagaries too. I guess so. 'Bye. I want more porridge! You know... Someone's been watching us all night Really? Who? That guy. Who is he? Viktor. Mummy's Viktor. He doesn't look very likable. But I wouldn't know. You're right. So take him off the wall. I shall. I'll be back tonight. Yes. Just a moment. It's for you. - For me? - Mm. No need to look so scared. How the hell did you know? Damn! Thanks. I've been called up. I've been called up. I heard you the first time. What's bugging YOU? Me? Nothing. There IS something. Funny that you were called up. Yeah... hilarious. I'll be away at least 4 months. - You realise that?! - So what? - Ruth! - Not so hard. You're hurting me! What will you do while I'm away? Well, I don't know yet. Is my little boy jealous already? I'll go crazy if you cheat on me. If I did, you'd dump me, would you? I sure would. So off you go. Come back to me soon. I won't wait forever... Not for long. Understand? Martin... what are you doing? I'm off! Back to Stockholm. You're nuts! Maybe I am. But I'm doing it anyway. You're insane! This is wartime... You'll shot if they see you! I won't be seen. Or you'll finish up in prison for years. Well, so be it. Goodbye. I won't let you go, you idiot! Oh yes you will. Who is this? Viktor. Mummy's Viktor. Shall I go see Charlotte? No. A handsome young man. And strong. - With bad manners. - Go to hell! I was just leaving. "Mummy's Viktor". Congratulations, Ruth dear. The jealous type. You've chosen well this time. Goodbye. Forgive a little irony, young man. It's only from envy. Don't hit me. I'm rather fragile. What was he doing here? Forget about Viktor. I could have bayoneted that bastard! You should have. I would've done it with pleasure. You're out of your mind. I saw one thing. You were enjoying it. You expected me to hit him. What was he doing here? He came for his painting. Why didn't he take it with him? He was probably too afraid that you'd kill him. Let go of me! What's this damned interrogation about? - You with a new man. - He's no man. How do you know that? Coz Mummy told me. You've deserted. What are you going to do? I don't know. - Can't I stay here? - No. Tomorrow you'll be in all the papers... ...and Viktor remembers faces very well. Viktor again! No, it's nothing like that! You go and get some sleep, while I try to work something out. Sleep?! So I'm to sleep?! Do you imagine I came here to sleep? Would you like to go to the chimney sweep concert? Wherever you want to go. I just have to change clothes. That devil is watching us again. You really do have terrible manners! Aren't you coming back anymore? I don't know. Do you have to go? You know very well that I've deserted. May I know where you are going? I don't know, myself. I'll do what I have to. I'm not myself anymore. I feel I'm possessed. I've been told I was sick. Maybe that's right. There's no pain. Maybe it hurts so much... ...that I don't feel it anymore. Don't look at me like that, Frida. Hug Pil for me. Maybe everything will be fine again. Maybe this madness will leave me. I don't know. Maybe I'll be normal again. I feel so nervous. You've nothing to be nervous about. Soon he'll play a false note, and embarrass us. He said he's practised for 3 months. So how come that bad note? You're my fiance on leave. I work as a housemaid in Ostermalm. My boss won't allow us to live there. Understand? Why? We have to have somewhere to live. How can it work out that way? I know it can. I know that man who played the solo. Wait for me here. I'll fix it. - Well done, Svensson. - You did an excellent job. Especially that high note. At least it came down again! And with so much feeling... I got a lump my throat. Come over to my place for a drink. - Just one? - No, two. Wait for me outside. I'll go find my wife. - Hi, Mr Chimney-sweep! - Not so loud! I just wanted to congratulate you. Thank you. See you later. Do you have any rooms for rent? What do you mean by that? You're crazy. Listen... I saw how you were when you played. I've been thinking a lot about you lately. In what way? I've been longing for you. Would you have a room for a couple of weeks? It's for me and my brother. We've got nowhere to go now, as our mother has thrown us out. - Yes, I can well imagine. - What did you say? Damn, that's Magda coming. Your wife? I could have a few things to talk about. Well... do you have a room or not? I'd have to talk about it with Magda, first. Martin...! Come over here. - Do we have something to eat? - It's coming. Go get the coats. We can just put down some mattresses. - Svensson. - Palsson. Pleased to meet you. I'll just go and fetch Johanssson and Ostmann. You stay here. I know what they're like. So, this is your brother. That's right. You're not at all alike. No, we have different fathers. We have a room you could rent, but it's not very big. It is actually what you'd call a utility room. Really very small. How much? 75, paid in advance. That's fine... Shall we take it? We thought we could make a little out of it. But we're having guests tonight. We wouldn't disturb you. Come on, we'll go get our stuff. Here are your coats. I don't think he's her brother... But 75 a month will be nice. That's exactly what I thought, dearest. I think a drink and something to eat would be nice now, eh? Magda... What did you think of my playing? Out of tune. Out of tune! Ragnar... Let's not beat about the bush... Have you heard anything? Do you know anything? No, nothing. Only about the report on him... As usual it was passed on to the police and so on. I think Martin's in difficulty. I don't know why... I just feel it. What do his parents think? They're very upset. Maybe the scandal is the worst. I don't know. I can't help feeling sorry for them. Who's that? An old friend from university. - She seems rather flash. - Yes, she is, too. Hi there old boy! Hi there. I'd like you to meet Mrs Grande. My name's Grankvist. Can I join you? Of course. So how's it going with 'History of Literature'? Going okay. We've been missing you, of course. We worry about you getting wet feet, or worse. I did an oral test yesterday. Did it go well? Of course not. It was a disaster. What a beautiful hat you're wearing. Think so? It's adorable. Are you married? Yes, I am. Yeah, my guy and I are gonna get married. Long engagements are rather nerve-wracking. For the girl, anyway. He doesn't want to... but I'll bring him round. - Can you cook? - Yes, a bit. Me too. I enjoy cooking... So long as I'm not forced to, of course. But you're sure to be, once you're married. Yes... maybe so. No, I have to keep moving. 'Bye, darling. You need a shave. Goodbye. Nice to have met you. We should get together some time and talk about the soul. - 'Bye. - 'Bye 'bye Was that her? Who do you mean? I'm not stupid, Ragnar. Yes, that was her. How did you know? The perfume. Martin's clothes had the same smell when he came home... ...after staying the night at your place. Give me a cigarette. She seemed afraid of you. I don't know why. It just seemed that way. She's a different type. Men probably fall for her. I'm not crazy about her. We hardly know each other. The was she carried on was ridiculous. And I'm a damned fool. A very nice fool. Would you like to come to dinner with me and Pil? Yes, thanks. - Do you want dessert? - Afterwards? - Don't we usually? - I don't have to eat it. I put too much starch in it. You're acting strange. Really? - Here's an ashtray. - It's full. - That's our stuff. - I know. I'm fed up with hearing that radio all day. I have a pimple on my thigh. It hurts. Disgusting pimples... Because I can't have a bath every day. You had hot water in town. Right, and in my mother's house too. What are you doing every day in town? I paint. So... That's it. You're giving me that strange look again. Why's your hair different? Because I like it. - Don't you think it's nice? - No. You're entitled to your opinion. Maybe Viktor likes your hair like that. Maybe so. So... you've been seeing him! I didn't say that. - Stop it! - What? Stop tormenting me! - You enjoy it. - Do I? Poor little Martin. You know... I'm sorry, but... I do have to go into town this evening. What? You can come up with better than that. Don't be so sure I'll come back here again. That's good... Seeing Viktor? Say it. Then you hear how stupid it sounds. Think you're clever, eh? But be careful, my friend. Are you bluffing? I thought you were smarter than that. I can, for example tell your Frida where you are. Then she comes here instead of me. That'd be fun, wouldn't it? Or Frida and your mummy and daddy... ...to take their lost son back home. Leave Frida out of this. I've met her. I told her about us... Various things. You're lying! She looked like a lily of the valley. Help! No, this is it... Get out, or we call the police. - We'll do it! - You wouldn't dare. Shut up, you upper-class hussy! You can talk! Have you forgotten what you and I got up to? That's a lie... a goddamn lie! You can get out right now. What have you done there? Come with me first. You're birds of a feather. I've nothing against you, but your girlfriend's horrible. You can stay if you like... ...but she has to go. Understood? No, that's impossible. Thanks anyway. Thanks for not calling the police. Are you in trouble? You could say that. I suppose it's the girl. It's me... only me. But it'd all be because of her. Thanks, I can finish it alone. Hey... Have a drink... I reckon you can use one. Thanks. Listen... About you having to scram... You can both stay the night. Alright? Yes, thanks. You forgot this. Next time can we do things differently? Are you looking for someone? Santa Claus, maybe? Or some little lost Lucia Bride? Nobody in particular. You don't usually get upper-class customers here, do you? Not from the nobility of course. Just shut up! Whatever you say. Pardon me! I assure you that... in my hotel... Fine. We'll just see who's here. In the middle of the night? All the guests are asleep. I'm not so sure about that. - But Inspector... - I'll take this with me. But all their papers are in order. We'll see about that. The police... a raid. What do you want? Excuse me. The police... a raid. Did you like the coffee? No. I want you to like my coffee.. Do you like ginger-snaps? They're OK. But you HAVE TO like ginger snaps. I think ginger snaps are the yummiest things on earth. My darling! Do you think I play well? It's OK. OK?! You have to think I'm a wonderful player. Because I AM wonderful. Everything here is wonderful. The room, the walls, the ceiling, the furniture. Everything. And do you know what? That makes YOU wonderful. The police. A raid. The police? Pardon, I don't mean me. I wanted to warn you, in case it was undesirable they should run into you. Is there a back way out of here? I thought so. One of our specialties. Get yourselves ready... I'll give you the signal. This is exciting! - Where shall we go? - I don't know. So where did they go then? They crawled into another hole, and hunted rats. Marie, what are you doing with my books? Tidying them up. They haven't been dusted since Christmas, and it's already May. 'Maria, Maria, arbiter of spring... As the buds burst on the trees'' Leave my books alone... You'll mess everything up. I asked you where they went. - They moved into a castle. - Really? It was no ordinary castle. It lay beyond the sun and the moon. With gates of gold and diamond windows. You could only find it if you were really crazy. The police still couldn't find it. They did their best... ...but didn't count on a case of sublime insanity. I'm really curious about that castle. Whereabouts is it? I wouldn't know. Somewhere outside of town. Ruth would've found it. It was marvelous. A palace of iron and concrete, with four floors. With huge hallways and secret storerooms. They quietly crept around with noiseless steps. High up under the rafters... ...an eery wind whimpered and wailed. Day and night. Through the dusty windows... ...one could see the black night... ...with its billions of stars. There's someone on the stairs. Isn't there? As busy as usual here. Happy New Year!... You damned rats. Did you hear what he said? We must have lost track of time. We live in a world without time or space. Happy New Year. Happy New Year? What will that mean? Do you hear that? It's just the wind... ...that blows day and night. Maybe it's locked in. Listen, it's as if it were alive. I'll draw it. He has a very long nose. He flies around and bites in his own tail. Draw us. This is the moon, you see? He looks jealous. He is... of us. Here's the nightwatchman... And a gang of rats. And what's that? That's a sign, on which it says... "Come and see great passion! Only 25 cents." The arrow points into this storeroom... ...but the watchman stops anyone coming in. He calls: "Today they're tired. Come back another time." - But where are we? - Here. These little squiggles? We don't have faces. We don't? Let me look at you. You must be tired. No. Yeah... You ARE tired. What will become of us? We have to find somewhere else. Where to? And where do we get the money from? Leave that to me. I have to come up with a plan. You and your plans! We're still alive aren't we? Indeed we are. Don't you think... Don't you think we're more alive than most people? Are you worried? No, are you? No. I'm actually very happy. And we can always... ...come up with a plan. Martin... Martin! Well, it's Ruth... Happy new year! Would you like a cup of tea? Have some eggnog. No. I want money from you. All you have with you. Of course, my girl. What do you need it for? That's neither here nor there. What if you don't get any money... - What happens then? - You know very well. This time it's not for my sake. For that young man, eh? Yes. We'll go away together. The wanted man. I remember faces very well. Nice boy, but a bit violent. A nice boy? That's lovely to hear. - How much do you want? - All you have at the moment. - I'm broke. - You're lying as usual. See for yourself. What's this? A couple of hundred. Where did you find them? This is not funny. - Why don't you sit down? - I'm in a hurry.. We need to have a talk some time when you're home.. Viktor, snuff the candles. Ruth dear, you're becoming paranoid. You keep tormenting me and Viktor over the one issue... ...which has no significance for you at present. Ruth, dear... I want nothing but what's best for you. I've always loved you like I was your own father. If your mother and I could have married, everything would have been simpler... You would've had a firm hand... Groping my breasts? That was what I felt. A cold, steady hand. That's not true, Ruth. All I can suggest is that you've somehow imagined this. You were very sensitive and highly strung at the time. Yes, that's right... it's quite easy to explain. You had disappointments in your love-life lately. And you're blaming that on an imagined story. I've been trying for ages to forget that evening. If you two had said ... "Yes, that's true, Ruth!" It might have been alright. But now it's impossible. I'm freezing cold inside, and you two have made me possessed. I can't shake it off... There's this big horrible monkey... with no eyes. If you want to, we can go see a psychiatrist. Yes of course. I know an excellent doctor. I'm sure it would be best to consult an outsider... ...who can prove that I'm innocent of this accusation. No... I'm not seeing a shrink. But Ruth, darling, what do you want us to do? There is nothing we can do. Are you in love with this boy, dear? Yes... No, not really. It's becoming something else. Something horribly abnormal. It's my fault. And YOURS, Viktor. There's no point in discussing this, if you're not going to talk sense. I remember the night well. I was 12 years old. I admired you enormously. I thought Mummy was the most beautiful woman in the world. And you Viktor, were the most stylish and bravest man I'd ever seen. That's why I was so happy when you came and sat with me. Do you remember that? Mummy wasn't home, so I had you all evening for myself. Well of course we had lots of nice little chats over the years... But... You had hold of my hand. I thought that was so great. You said we'd go to a movie next day. A Saturday. Then you talked about Paris... You'd just been there... ...and you'd flown in an aeroplane. And while you were talking... ...you just stroked my forearm. It made my head spin. - We've heard enough of this. - Just stop it now! Suddenly his hand was over my breasts. He didn't say a word. Your pinky and ring finger rested on my left nipple. I can still feel it. I felt so terribly hot. It was unbearable. Then, ever so slowly... ...it got colder. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I wanted to weep, but I couldn't. You went on talking about your flight... ...with the same quiet voice. Then you left. I didn't say anything for a long time, but the pain and the cold increased. It was as if that hand was still there. Remember, Mummy, when I could no longer keep quiet... ...how you hit me... ...and said I was lying, and must be crazy? I'm sorry Ruth... I just didn't understand... Since then I've just gone on feeling that hand on my breasts. Then Martin came, and I thought I could be freed of it. I really worked at it. I tried and tried... ...but in vain. I'll never be free. I just keep going with that blind monkey in me. I'll keep the money. You could go to the police. But I don't think you will. I'm quite sure you won't. Goodbye, and Happy New year. Take care of yourself, Ruth. Ruth...! Whether it was true or not... ...please don't say anything to anyone. You poor devil... I probably won't. Viktor! There are still candles burning. What are you doing? - Nothing. I thought you were counting money. So what? How did you get it so quickly? I screwed Santa Claus of course. What did you think? Did you steal it? I did a bit of blackmailing. Please leave me alone now. I'll tell you about it later, but I need to sleep now.. 700 kronor... - That's a lot of money! - I got it from Mummy. You're lying. - I DID get it from Viktor. - Why? I can't say... Just be happy we have it. - Why did he give it to you? - It really doesn't matter. Whatever I did, it was for YOUR sake.. MY sake?! You don't think that I'm the one wanted by the police? I think I have to get away from here. Martin...! No... I'll be on my way. Martin, you mustn't go... You mustn't! You keep on tormenting me. I can't understand why. Why do you try to confuse me? It only hurts. I'll cut you off... and throw you away. We've been strangers to each other all this time... We don't know each other at all. Goodbye. Martin! Please don't leave me. Don't go now. You're all I've got. I love you! I love you! I can't be without you! I'll die, I'll do away with myself. Oh, Martin! No... you're not going to do that. We can go back to the beginning. We can always start over. You'll regret this. You see... Now I recognise you. You'll regret this. You'll pay for this... You really will! And what happened then? Then... He was freed on my evidence. I was lucky to find a nice doctor... He convinced the military authorities Martin wasn't quite normal. And after that? After...? Then...?. I want to know hat happened after that. Martin broke off contact. He gave up his studies. I have not seen him since. But now it's spring. "The beautiful spring in twilight..." "...they met upon the hills..." "...shyly under the moon" What do you say to that? I'll go on dusting your books. You're driving me out of my house. Stop the damn dusting. Have you read the paper? "Ragnar Ekberg is a talented writer, and perhaps even a poet. " That's right... a poet. I've got money in my wallet, so we're going to celebrate. Lovely! But first I have to go home and change. Of course you must change. Wrap yourself in silk, velvet and pearls! Meanwhile I'll go and have a drink somewhere. Where? Wherever the May wind blows me. I'll call you. - Promise? - On my word as a poet. "...they met upon the hills... shyly under the moon" This is where the May wind blew me. Here I sipped my drink while Marie got dressed in silk, velvet and pearls. It was here that I learned that Martin was back with Ruth again. ...and that here, in room 212... ...we'd find the last piece of the puzzle... The one I hadn't found. Arne! Lift. - Could you get me a cab? - Certainly Mr Grande. Miss, a taxi for Mr Grande. We can go now. A taxi's on it's way. Well... If you get the money... ...What shall we do? We disappear... ...from everything here... ...and all the ugly, boring people. We'll be rich. We've come out of hell to heaven. That's all that counts. We'll go a long way away. We'll go into the mountains... ...and swim in the streams. We'll lie down on the mossy banks. We won't think, or plan ahead. We'll live each day as it comes. We have to forget what we respected, forget our old ways. I hadn't thought about it before. I was such an idiot. Yes... You have indeed been an idiot. But what about autumn, and the money's run out... ...and perhaps it rains. There'll always be a solution... ...if I've got YOU. You do love me now, don't you? Yes, I love you. I love you so much... ...that I don't even have to ask you if you love me. Martin... When you came back to me... ...do you remember being afraid. Yes, I was afraid. I'm still afraid. But I don't want to think about that anymore. Why are you afraid? Because you're not quite yourself. Not entirely. Not like before. That's only what you think. Maybe I've changed too. At first all I wanted was your body. Now I love you. Why are you smiling? - Because I'm glad you say that. Why are you smiling? So easy to... Yes, you are afraid! Stop it, Ruth! Mrs Grande? This is the concierge... You're taxi's waiting. I see... I'm coming. Who was that? Guess. Stop playing games! Who was it? The chimney-sweep. We're going to the movies together. He said he wanted to see me again. I said, "Call me." He just did. You're not going. Yes I am. You're not to go! Yes... I'm going. I didn't intend telling you... I'm going away for good. It's a pity about you. Ruth! Goodbye, my dear. Do you remember the storeroom... ...how dramatic I was? Do you remember how I begged and wept after you? I loved you then. And you just went. Try to be just as strong as back then, Martin. You'll probably succeed. In the end, you and I are total strangers to each other. It might have become something else entirely... ...but you killed it, on that occasion. But I came back. Yes, you did do that. Just like you'd come back to a whore. And I took you back like I was one. But now... now you loved me.. I see it in your eyes. And it makes me glad. I don't believe you. - I don't believe you. - Yes... I became what I was turned into. And now I'm going. Ruth! You can't! Don't get hysterical now... ...but you can experience what it feels to be alone. - If you go, I'll kill myself. - Go ahead. Had you it done it earlier, we'd have been spared this farce. Let go of me... Don't touch me! I love you. I love you. Ruth! Where is 212? Down there, first door on the right. You're not to worry, my boy. You'll soon start to feel better and you'll mend. Then everything will be OK. Frida's fine. Pil is fine. He's growing up quickly. But that's not what I wanted to talk about.. No. Yes... well... I wanted to suggest a trip to America. For you, Frida and Pil. At my expense, of course. And then everything will be fine. You'll see. You can study again It may be good for you to have got away from it. When I was your age, I'd already been abroad a number of times. Cheer up, my boy. Frida's fine... Pil is growing up fast. I just told you that, didn't I. As I said... Everything will work out for the best. So long as you get well... everything will be... ...good. No need for you to wait. I guess not. Goodbye then, Martin. Good luck... over there. - Remember to give Pil my love. - Yes, I'll tell him. - Will you write to me? - Of course I'll write, Martin. - Is the train moving? - Any moment now. Frida... It's for Pil's sake, isn't it? We talked about my coming back, but I still haven't decided. Not yet? Maybe in a while. When I come back from America. When... I'm home again. That would be best for Pil. Yes, Martin. Because... ...you and Pil... The two of you... ...are all I have. - Take care of each other. - Goodbye, Martin. I'm not going to wave. Goodbye. Goodbye, Martin. Goodbye. Give Pil my love. He's gone now. I saw that. You didn't throw yourself in front of the train? No. You're not cutting your wrists, or doing anything else dramatic? Sorry. That was stupid of me. No, it was natural. I think you love him, don't you? - Why do you ask? - He's coming back. Not to me. To you. - You're just saying that. - No. I know it. That's the way it is. Goodbye. That was a strange situation. You still here? Can I see you to the bus? What will she do now? She'll try to kill the blind monkey inside her, with someone else. - Monkey? - Yeah. It's a complicated story. And a long one. I feel sorry for her. Frida, my sweet... you never change. Thank goodness there are still people like you! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
