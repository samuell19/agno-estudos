We tried sending notes to each other on paper airplanes. Definitely did not work, so we just yelled. - Right, Claire. How long has it been since you've seen her? - Few years, I guess. - Will you help me out and set the table while I finish up dinner? - Yeah--hey, Mom, did someone move into the Goodsters' old house? - Yeah, Claire did a couple of months ago. Just for a little while. Thought I told you. - No...I thought that her parents moved out. - Well, they did but, you know, her grandmother originally owned the house and she got really sick, and so Claire moved back to take care of her before she just passed away. I could have sworn I told you. - I think I would have remembered. - Huh. - You know, my mind is actually like a steel trap. If you want me to teach you some things, I can. [doorbell rings] - Saved by the bell. - That is probably Claire and Lily right now. I invited them over for dinner.

Don't take it personally. Lily doesn't remember a lot of people from high school. She was little too busy with her face in a book. I'm sorry, I preferred the classics to our classmates. Oh, well, that's my sweet Lil. Always too busy reading the romantics. Hey, Claire, I'm really sorry about your grandma. My mom just told me. - Oh. - Yeah, sorry, Claire. - Thanks, guys, you're sweet. - Remember that time she made us play Cinderella, just to clean the kitchen? - [laughing] Yes!

I wanna hear all about your photography, Claire. - Wow, you're a photographer now? - Yeah. - Wow, that's great. - Lily, what brought you back to town? - Um, well, I moved back after college and I now own a boutique flower shop.

Why didn't you ever tell me? - I never told anyone. Not even Claire. - Why do you think you have trouble expressing yourself? - I did express myself. That's why I wrote it down. - Yeah, sure you did. In a letter that was never sent. That's not expressing yourself, my man. - She was thepopular girl in high school. She never would've gone out with me. It's a stupid high school crush. It's probably for the better that I didn't tell her. So, let's just forget about it. - You still love her. - No, I don't. Just-- Whatever. I'm going to bed. - It's like 8:30! - I'm jetlagged. - That's ridiculous. - Good night! - Whatever. Sleep tight, pumpkin. - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm just going through all these photos. Look at this. First day of kindergarten. - What a handsome young man. - Yes! A totally handsome young man. You're so cute. Look at this of you and Claire. How cute are you two together? - Seems like ages ago. - It does. - Okay, who is that and what are you wearing? - Yeah, I know. This is-- well, this is Edith and this was sort of our sorority signature. We would just wear these crazy hats to parties. - And you lost a bet, you got the zebra? - And I lost the bet! I got the--exactly. - She's in a lot of pictures with you. - Yeah, she was my best, dearest friend. - What happened? - Oh, we just kind of, you know, fell out of touch. - Why is that? - Well... because of your dad, actually. Edith had dated your dad first, but it wasn't very serious. They had just dated for a couple of weeks, and about six months later, your dad was just so charming and fun and sweet and we fell in love. And Edith and I got in a big fight about it because she was hurt and she was mad, and I felt so terrible. - That's really surprising. - Well, why is that surprising? I mean, relationships come and go. They--people change. - Oh, no, no, no--that dad had that effect on women. - He was charming, and look at him! He was handsome and sexy. - Okay, all right. That's enough. - Yeah. [laughs] - Yeah, these photos are really all I have left of him. And I miss him. - I miss him too. - [sighs] - I can't believe this place hasn't changed. It's the same shops, the same people. - I know! I love it. I love it, I think this place is so special. It's, you know, a smaller, quieter life, but it feels so much cozier than downtown L.A. - Well, maybe you should just enjoy it while you're here. - That's true. And it might actually take a while to find a buyer. I still need to get that house in shape. There's a lot of repairs that need to get done on it. - I could totally help you out. - Oh, that's right! Your mom mentioned you owned a construction company. But I wouldn't want you to work on your vacation. - Oh, no, no. Please, I'd love to help. - Mm, I don't know. I really don't want you to... feel used. - Okay, hey. Let's do a trade. I will help you out with the house and you help me out with my mom's party. There's still loads to be done and I have no idea what I'm doing. - Well, I love doing that stuff, so you have a deal, sir. - Oh. - It's official. We'll draft a contract after this. - Oh, okay. - [laughs] [bell dings] - Hey. - Hi. - How's it going? - Just thought I'd come check out the shop. Everybody spoke so highly of it last night. - [chuckles] - Really nice. - Thank you. - So what got you into the flower business? - Well, when I wasn't reading, I was usually out in the garden with my mom. Most of the time, I'm just helping people find ways to show their loved ones that they care using these bouquets of flowers and also expressive notes. - So this is what you were talking about last night at dinner? - Yeah. - Oh. [clears throat] "My first and only love, "I wake filled with thoughts of you "and I ask myself every moment if this happiness is not a dream." Wow. You're a really good writer. The language reminds me of a favorite romantic quote of mine. - Oh, who's that? - Lord Bryan. - Lord Bryan? - Of course, his work is-- it's great. Read it all the time. - Then you should probably know that his name is George Gordon Byron. - You got me. I don't know a whole lot about this romance stuff but I'd like to learn more about it. Maybe you could share some of your favorites with me. Coffee or something? Maybe tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. - Well, I will probably be working tonight. I usually like to keep an assortment of cards on hand and I need to replenish a bit. - Maybe I could help you with that. - I thought you just said you don't about this romance stuff. - I could give it a shot. - [sighs] It's a very nice offer. But after a long day of managing the shop, I think I just need to get these done, um, before it gets too late. - Yeah. Maybe another time, then. - Maybe. - So I thought we could walk through the house and make a list of repairs that need to get done. - Sounds good. - Uh, first thing on the list. This doorjamb needs to be replaced. - Hmm. According to this data, you stopped growing right about here. - Oh, hilarious. That's when I stopped measuring. Come on. So this fence needs to be fixed. One of those slats is broken there. - Oh man, didn't you break this when you fell into it? - Yep. - Yeah, we were playing tag and you tripped. - Uh, no. We were playing zombies and you pushed me. - Okay, maybe we should leave the scene of the crime before you injure yourself again. - Yeah, before you, you know, get the urge to just push me again. Don't, don't, don't. And here... Is another area of the house that little Henry broke: The front steps. Third grade, playing tag. - Winning tag. - Yeah, well, either way. - That's all we had to do? - Yup. - Well, you're certainly earning your keep around here. - I'll bill you later. - All right, sure. - [laughs] Oh, that is ridiculous. [groans] - Thanks so much again for doing this. - Of course. You want to get started early tomorrow? - Yes, that would be great. I also wanted to talk to you about your mom's party. - Uh, I have taken care of the invitations and the catering. So we just need decorations and-- oh, we definitely need more tables and chairs. - Okay, great. What's the theme? - "Susan's 50th Birthday Bash." - You don't have a theme? Every good party has a theme Like "'80s Night" or "Great Gatsby." - "Halloween" or-- Oh! "4th of July." Stop, you're just naming the holidays, it's weird. Look, you know what? We need to brainstorm. Uh... [blows raspberry] You know what? The energy here is no good. We need someplace where we can clear our heads. - Ah, come with me. - Okay. Where we going? - You'll see. - Hey. What are you doing here? - I thought if you were still working that I could maybe help. You know, with the writing and everything. - Really? Um... It did not seem like your area of expertise. - Yeah, well, after I got home, I came up with some stuff. - Oh, did you? - Yeah, I mean, I figured you've got all these cards that are supposed to be written by men. I figured you should have something that's actually written from the male perspective. - What do you have in mind? - [clears throat] "I remember the first time I saw you. "Remember it like it was yesterday, "but, for some strange reason, "I can't remember when I fell in love with you. "It's almost like I've always been in love with you, "even before we met. And I was just waiting for you to walk into my life." "These feelings have always been there. They haven't gone away and I don't think they ever will." - You wrote that? - Yep. All me. Uh...I guess I'm just... A little more romantic than you thought. - It's actually pretty late, and I have to be up early in the morning... So-- - No, I also--I should-- Get going, also. Good night, Lily. - Good night, Tom. - We really need to sneak into our high school to come up with party ideas. - Yes. It's very peaceful when no one else is around. It can be inspiring. - It's inspiring anxiety. - [laughs] Builds character. - Starting to sweat a little bit. - Gross. - Yeah, it's, uh-- - Yes? - It's making my vision go bad. I need my glasses again. - Nerd. - Let me help. Don't want you tripping and breaking another set of stairs. - Ah, ha ha. [laughs] - So what? You want to wander the halls and talk of memories past? - "Memories past?" Not exactly my plan here, Jane Austen. No, we need to relax, and let the creative juices flow. That's what I do with my photos. I go to a special place and let the inspiration come to me. - Isn't that your old hangout? - You remembered. - This place hasn't changed a bit. - I know, I love it. It's nice knowing that some things never change. You got any ideas yet? - Since I've been home, all she's been doing is looking at her photos. - Oh. Well then, why don't we decorate her place with them? Yeah, we can put them up in the backyard, hang them with some Christmas lights. - That sounds awesome. - Yeah. Oh, and, and... we can even print one out and put it on her cake. - That does not sound awesome. - Yeah. [laughs] - You should have stopped there. - I know, I know, I know. But see? I told you. This place is perfect for brainstorming. [romantic music] ♪ [laughing] - Hey, you. - Rich!

I barely see you. - Well, exactly, which is-- I'm gonna start researching realtors. - You don't need to do that.

She's got a boyfriend? - Yeah! I mean, you were right. Just seeing her again has brought back all these, like, old feelings. [sighs] And we're getting along so well. I mean, I'm an idiot. I thought that I actually had a shot. - I'm sorry, man. - She never even mentioned him. - Well, why would she? Well, you never said you had feelings for her, so-- - If you're in love with somebody, don't you at least mention their name? - You've hung out with her, what, a couple of times? I think you need to let this go. You said yourself, this is what, a crush from 10 years ago? - [sighs] Yeah, you're probably right. - Just give it some time and then you'll get over her. You know? Or you'll find something wrong with her. Like she doesn't own a TV. - You're still upset about that girl. - Who doesn't own a TV? I'm just saying.

Home. - Well, you don't have to sell. - Yeah, but...Rich wants me to move to the city so that we can finally, you know, take the next step. - I think you should just talk to him.

It's, uh... - Now, this isn't funny. - I'm not joking. - Uh, hey, Mom. When you were cleaning upstairs, you didn't happen to come across a letter or paper with some writing on it, did you? - What kind of writing? - Uh, it was a letter that-- - You'd know if you'd seen it. - Do you need help looking for it? - No! Thank you. - Okay. - We have to find that letter. - It's gotta be around here somewhere, okay? We'll find it. I mean, we have to, before somebody else stumbles across it especially-- - Claire! - Yes, Claire, exactly. Why do you have to interrupt me all the time? - Yeah, if the letter's swimming around in here somewhere, she cannot be here. I'm gonna distract her. You find it! - All right, all right. - Hey, Claire. - Hey, hey. Is everything okay? You seemed really flustered and then you just ran off without any explanation. - Flustered? I seemed flustered? - Yeah, and you still do. - That's weird--I mean, why would I be flustered? - Oh. I think I know what's going on. - You do? - Yeah. And you really shouldn't worry so much. The party's gonna be great. - [exhales] - And we still have a full week. You're right, you're right. It's the party.

Yeah. - Great. - Oh, uh, did you need wrapping paper for your present? - Present? - Please do not tell me you forgot to get your one and only mom a birthday gift? - I thought planning the party was a gift. - Oh, wow. You really don't know moms. Or women. - Uh, maybe we could-- Oh, do something with the photos she's been looking at. - We could digitize them. That way they won't get lost or damaged and she can look at them whenever and wherever she wants. - Yeah, yeah. And we can play like a slideshow during the party. - And I could take some portrait shots of you, to add to the collection. - That's perfect. - Great.

Oh, if you guys want to cut through right here, it saves you like 15 seconds. - [laughs] It saves us a ton of time. All right. Good night. We used to do it as kids. Let's go. - Okay. - Oh, look! - Hmm? What is it? - It shows how my height has changed over the years. - Oh, that's cool. - Yeah, Henry took it off in one piece so that I can keep it. - Why would you want to keep it?

But if this continues, we could... go weeks without seeing each other--is that what you want? - No, no. - I'll make more of an effort to come to you. - It's not about that. Think about your career.

Are these the original hardwood floors? - Yes, I think so. - Rich mentioned that some work is being done to the place? - I have a friend in construction who's been helping me with some minor repairs. I figured it'd be the right thing to do if I decide to sell. - If? - I'm still not sure. - I understand. I've had many clients who have trouble selling a place that means something to them. This isn't just a house.

How Henry's hard work is really gonna help us sell the house, and how thankful I am that he's helping you move on. - Henry's been doing a great job. - You know, I--uh... actually, I think I need to get going. - No, why?

According to all the women's magazines, active listening is what you really need from your man. - Good to know. - You're welcome. But, honestly, to have a serious, lasting relationship, you just need to be good friends first. You know, you need to connect on that base level. Like, it's more than a romantic relationship, you enjoy spending time together now matter what you're doing, and you have a rhythm.

Since this is the last week of high school, I think it's finally time for me to tell you the truth. I remember the first time that I saw you, down to the smallest detail. It was the day that you moved in next door and I watched you sit down on the front porch, cheering the movers on. I remember that like it was yesterday, but, for some strange reason, I don't remember when I fell in love with you. It's almost like I've always been in love with you, even before we met. And I was just waiting for you to walk into my life. These feelings have always been there, they've never gone away and I don't think they ever will. I wrote that senior year of high school, but I could have written it today because I feel exactly the same way. Every single word of it. [romantic music] ♪ - What took you so long? [laughing] ♪ - So you're telling me he's been in love with you all this time? - Yeah. Ever since high school. Do you want to see the letter? - Yes. - Oh, oh, um... - It's so sticky. - B--um-- - Tom! - What's going on, darling? [upbeat guitar music] I can explain. I told you--I told you... I wanted you to see me differently. That those words were not mine. - You never said that this was from Henry's love letter to Claire from high school. - Um, it's not--listen. - How could you do this to me? Get over here right now. You are in so much trouble. So much trouble. Come here. ♪ [mellow rock music] ♪ [rock music] ♪
