That's what snow looks like. Or so There aren't two snowflakes with the same pattern One can look like this. Another one like this And when they melt, it disappears the pattern and will never come again My dad and mom love snow. So much they've got own ski slope - What a nice little plant you have. - Yes. Thanks, fun. Will the acid come too or? Yes. It's fun when everyone is here. That, I'm Frank. And that's my little sister... - This is life! - Monky. Monky is called Saga, but is called Monky because she thinks she's a monkey Monky, you can't jump in it. Okay? I just sorted them out! Monky ...! No! Hi, Monky! I want my grandmother! (sounds like a monkey) (mom sounds like a monkey) –Little Saga! - My name is not Saga, but Monky. You smell the baby, little Monky. We have to wash your suit. Hard to believe, but Saga is sick. So sick that she has to get medication Before she started taking the medication they thought she would be happy So we went on a trip to Thailand We were at a house like that for sick monkeys - Hello! - Where is Saga? Saga, come on. Come on! You must not be there. Come on! Not inside the rope. Saga kind of fell in love with everyone. It was like she recognized herself. Thought she was one of them - No, I live here! - Release now. We need to go. You, the heart. It's not funny. We can no longer cope. - Fairy tale. - Look here. Since we were at the monkey stand she has been completely crazy We have to put some list there... No, Monky! Come down! Don't swing! - No, not the lamp. - How did you get up there? She does what she wants and no one care. Except for Grandma, of course - Hi Grandma. - Sweetie. - Hi mom. - Hello Hello. You can not do that. I get really worried. Thanks, Shirin, because you keep an eye on her. Of course. Go and work now. Hello there. Hi. Strong, small, brave man. You know... Sometimes I wish I could eat up all your medicines for you. So you relax. Hi, Frank! Saga... No, sorry, I mean Monky. Would you like some hot chocolate? But, Frank, I promise. It is so when you die. Everything is just right as usual. Although I am a monkey. - You can draw it. - Stop it, Monky. Please Frank. Draw it. Otherwise I'll stop a banana chip in your ear. - Okay. - I want to be up on the ski slope. It should be you, me, mom, dad. I want to sit on your shoulders. Like a little monkey. Why don't you tell Frank how sick is she? - But you see well, she is nice. - Monky! What do you want for your pizza? I want banana chips and a hundred spotted sausages. It will be a Favorita! With a lot bananas. No, more, more, more! He doesn't get a chance to prepare. - Best atmosphere in the whole city... - Stop! You have to tell Frank. He believes that Saga will recover. Mom, when do I stop being Flintis? - Soon, old man. - Grandma's sweetest little flint. Pappis. Frankis. And so I like Apis. And so Mammis so clear. All right, all the crap. Who's here? Apis, Apis... Apis, Apis... Elephant... Kamelis. Monky, praise that you stay with me. You must never leave me. Promise it. In fact, you just have to promise it. I promise, Frank. I will never leave you. I will never leave you. I will never leave you. Monky. This is what death looks like It will be black, empty and silent. Hello! - Hello. - Hello. Hi. - How was it at school then? - Good. - Okay. Who wants hot chocolate then? - Yes! Cool tip! Do you know what I'm going to do? At the village party I will do a fire show. It sounds like a great idea. - Stop nagging! - We have to plan for the winter season. Everything is reminiscent of her. But I'm not going to move to town. - It was such an incredibly stupid idea. - Yes. That was your idea. That we would lease this damned ski slope. It just stands and ticks money. It is better than throwing money on any apartment rental in town? Yes. But now we have no money. We have no money to throw at anything. - Can you do that somewhere else? - No I can not! I will never leave you. Frank! Frank, come on Frank! Frank! Frank! (stone against the box) Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? (Apljud) (Apljud) Come on then! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! - Wake! Wake up now, please! - What is it? There was someone in the forest. I think she was - Monky. That wasn't even fun. Go to sleep. Banana chips. She loves banana chips. (Apljud) (Knirr) (rattling) (cry) I knew that you would come back. Monky? Frank! Frank? What is it? She's back. Monky is back. Yes. Monky! Yes! I knew it! I knew it! I said it! Yes! No! Beware! - Now, take those eggs. - Check it out. Neat! There one came! - Well, Frank! - Oh, that hurts! Beware, down! Down down! Down, down, down! Down! There will be more. Beware, Frank. No! After! After! - It ran up! - It sprang up. Fast! We have to get it out. - It recognizes Apis. - Of course she does. What? Have you seen it? - No. Where is it? It's not here. Have you found it? - No. - I found her! Come on! - Now it goes up again. - What is going on? - Do you see it? Frank? - But... - But what does it do? Ullah! No...! - Do monkeys really eat spotted sausage? - It's good if we bond a bit. Okay. Potato. - Where did she go? - She went out. - No! - Oh. - She's on that one. - Monkey, wait. Frank? You're really... really high up. Monky. You're back. What are you doing here? You should be with us down there. Take it easy! That is dangerous. - What...? - Frank! You can get to the trunk and then you get down. No no no! - Paul, he can sit still. - He has to get down. - Sit down! - Frank knows what he's doing. You go into the trunk and take the same path as you came up. I don't think I can come down. Could you help me down? So. And then you take... Quiet and nice. And then came there... Great. You have one more step. And hands all the time. Grandma's finest. Now you should get a new flower from Grandma. So. Sweetie. Nooo... I read once - - as a three-year-old boy, I think, from Austria - - who suddenly started talking fluent Japanese Every day he played that he was a Japanese combat pilot - - which plunged into the sea. His mother and father thought everything was so strange - So they brought along his little boy to Japan - - where he got to meet a bunch of old war veterans. They were 90-year-old boys. And he recognized them. Every. Knew what they were called. And they recognized him. They said he was their Japanese old friend who has crashed into the sea. And now he was there... with them again. So I think that it might not be so strange. If she is. But of course she is. A monkey in our house? Hello! Yes, come on, up then. No! Oo, no! No, it's Axelsson's. We can't show Monky. Why can't we show Monky? - Hi, hope! - Hope! - Hi jump, hi jump. - Hope. (Apljud) (they yawn) It is wonderful to see you in the village. Full speed! Full speed. (they hum) It would be great if the rent for the hill had gained full speed into my account. Well. No, where were we, what did we say ...? The money, the rent is going in, absolutely. Now we have to hurry home, because... Nice weather. Yes... nice car. Yes... hey. Hello! Dad! What happens if they find out something? Hello! If they find out that Saga is back? - They saw nothing. What? - Shouldn't we go, Henry? What? Yes, yes. Yes. I've never thought of that that she is so... so hairy. A very special kind of... hair on that woman. - Who then? - Frank's mom is hairy as a monkey. Is that it? To be a little jealous, honey? But drive! If she is a monkey, people may think so that she should be in a zoo. What? - Monkey, go in! We don't think so, but someone may think so. - Like who then? The police or? - Yes, the police type. - Frank, pull in the living room. - Hello! - Yeah, what for? - Until we know more. - Can a monkey sleep in a regular bed? - Hello! - Grandma is here! - What are you doing in there? - She will never understand. - What should we do? It's your mother. You have to get rid of her. And I take Monky. - Monky, come on. I hear you are there. - Hi mom. - Why did you lock in? - But we never lock. Gosh... - There is little... My. I saw you before. It was so pretty. You looked so happy. You, I brought a pair of... boots which I thought Paul could get. You are completely silent. If you are not Grandma will notice. (Apljud) - Was it Frank? - No, he's sleeping. - Sover? - Yeah, he... he has a fever. The seam, oh. Oh oh oh. Sch! Quite quiet now! Then it is just as good that I look to him. Don't wake him, Mom! - We're coming now! And grandma is in! - No, don't wake him then. Shyy... Monky, Monky! But... but now you must calm down. Nahm... my darling. How are you? Do you have a fever? Mom, I think we should leave Franken... a little quiet. - Sleep a little. - Or how, Franken? - Yes. Read, sort some football pictures. True. Come on, Mom. I saw you when you were out and about. You will do this. - Only you are together. - But you... - I'm very tired now, Grandma. - Yes of course. We may be able to come up with something tomorrow, you and me. It becomes... (Apljud) - What was that? - I heard nothing. - I didn't either. - No, but I heard a sound. Yes, but, Mom, you have too started to hear a little bad. Yes, but when you hear badly, then you do not hear anything. - Now I heard something. - It may be that you hear things... –... that does not exist. - Exactly. Aha ...? No, but, corner, now I think... Who more than me is craving on... sponge cake? Hi, Grandma! Get well. - Bye. - Hello Hello. Hi. - No! - No no no! (cry) - The eyes are exactly like Sagas! - She finds here and knows where everything is. It is a wild animal. The bittersweet and if you look them in the eyes. Look at her. What, her? You may not know if the animal is a male or female. You see yourself. She has the same body language, the same movements. Look what it does now. She finds everything. It's like she's been here before. Monky, get Apis. You should see her with Apis. She remembers it. - Monky, get Apis. - No, sir. This is a miracle. - No. - It's a miracle. Grandma, you should see. She's back. So, we should celebrate in some way. Beloved friend... When you have been through something difficult then you may need to talk to someone. - Then I think you should. - Now I have not lost my grip. Mom, check out Monky! - Where did she get them from? - In the dirt. So cute! What? What are you saying? - No, it's my socks. - The name, check, check. - Monky... sweetie! - What a miracle. - I promise, she'll tell you. - No, she won't say anything. She does it. And so they come to take Monky away from us. You can say what you want about grandma, but she is not a gossip. - You have to say. - No. I am their friend after all. If you are worried for something, so say what it is. - I can not. - Please. - Do you promise not to tell anyone? - Of course. Yes, yes, absolutely. But a monkey? Can't she think of anything better? You can't say this to anyone now. Alia. That goes for you too. - Look me in the eye now. Not a word. - Yes, Mom. I will not. - Shouldn't we do a cozy corner? - Great idea. Do they have a living monkey living with them? I say it's a monkey. Don't you hear what I'm saying? I knew it. I knew I saw something. I saw it! Wait! Alia, hurry! Let's look at the monkey! Come on! Did you hear what he said? It is a monkey. - Monkeys chop people in their heels. - Come on, we have to check! - Mother! Dad! - What is it? - No, God! - Everything is there. Why are they? - Much can be said about grandma... - But she's not a gossip. I see it! I see the monkey! It's there! What should we do? I will take it. - What should we do? - No, we should... I don't know! - I'll take it. - Good, Hasse. - Hello. - Hello Hello! - What do you have in your heart? - I didn't bring them here! Hi mom. No, we just wanted to... check out so everything is okay with you. How nice. Well, everything is... - Everything is great. As usual. - Good good good. Tell me if you need help. - It's just to say. - Anything. - Yes Yes. - Of course we do. No... we shouldn't stand here and stand. - Let's go. - Hello Hello! Bye. Yes! It was actually something. - What ...? - What is this? It really is a... and a – a – a – p – p – pa. No... Shirin! Hello there. Hi. What? You can't believe that... - that that would be... - Of course it's Monky. Yes... no... Hi, Monky. How nice to have you back. What? -Let's go. Come on! - Hello Hello! - Look. - It can get infected. - Infection? How nice you look. - They may need it. - It's a monkey. - I know. - Yes, we all know it. - One wonders where it comes from. - A zoo, of course. The monkey skull has well escaped. It's exciting, Marianne. You must admit that. So exciting! (phone) Maraholm Zoo. This is Marianne Körsell. I may have a weird question. I wonder if you might has gotten rid of a monkey. - A monkey? - Yes. If you got rid of it a little gibbon monkey How are you thinking now? - Yes, but whether it has escaped or something. - No. - Hello Hello! - Did you see? - Strutsbo zoo. It's Tage - Yes, hey. I have a question. It may seem strange at first sight. Would a monkey have escaped? It is clear that I do not believe that you are neglecting your animals. I just wonder if you possibly can lacks a little gibbon monkey. How many zoos are there? - Järvbo Zoo. - Can you check out some extra in the papers? An animal that has escaped, you say? Yes, in your monkey stock. If you miss a little gibbon monkey. - Fan! Away! - Thank you thank you. Idiot! If this little animal can help them and give them some joy... How to help them by lying? - Frank! - Hello! Come on, Monky. It is quiet. Wow! Check out how ugly they are. - Töntar. - Just. Dorks. Oh, how sweet! Monky... You cannot come along and shop if you are going to keep it there. - Excuse. - What? Well, that doesn't do anything. Alia was exactly the same when she was little. Just. - Hi, jump. - Hope. Three flowering soils and two cow manure. Hello Hello. We must find something new. Otherwise we have to move to town. We have no savings. The last should Axelsson have, then it's goodbye. We can't afford another season. You should not move from here. None of us want to move. Nobody wants it, but... Ask for help. We are here after all. We'll solve this together. - Right? - I hate money. Yes! (Apljud) –Wife Axelsson? - Monky, where are you? Home delivery, please. - Monky? - Absolutely! Hasse! Come on! –Wife Axelsson? - What have you done? Your little boy. Now, you, my beautiful prince. The victory is mine! I'll wrap you in the dungeon. Yes. Look, Monky! Lost is the beautiful prince. Hello there. Cash. Hope you don't think I'm for it close now, but business is business. - Yeah, but... - We feel sorry for you, we do. Yes. But redo, redo. You are entrepreneurs. Paul! He took the money out of my hand. Yes. Although we owe them. That's it. –Business is business. - Stop kidding. I do not understand how it should go. Another accommodation. Another job, maybe. - I love this house. - I love it too. (loud acoustic sounds) Check out Monky! She's taken a hangman. - Where did she get it? - What is she doing? Oh! Check! Yay! It's like an adventure course. Corner... The forest behind the ski slope... Wouldn't you be able to ...? - Yes, yes, yes! - But what? What, then? - What is it now? - Frank. One of those... - Yes! - No. No. Many. Many. One like that too... - Large. High up. - Yes. Multiple. Yes. And up, up! - An adventure path! - We can't afford more ideas. Pick it up. I pull it out a bit and see... - It's round. - What are you saying? - It's round. - Is it round? Hi, Monky! It is round! - Hello. - Hello Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Oh, can you draw a little ...? - Carry, carry, carry. So, is it better? - How long do you want it? - It should be 20. 20? Okay, it's going to be long. - I think... Here, check here. - Yes. - Where. Right at it. - You will need financing. Axelsson! They can go into something like this. - A financier. - Great, honey. Oh, oh. App, app, app. Hello. Hey. - It's grandma. - We invite them to dinner. - Don't you want coffee? - No thank you, I am fine. - Yes! - Thanks so much. We are building a model. It's super. What? Marianne... - It's exciting, this, huh? - Absolutely cocobello. - We'll take more cakes. - More cookies. Sometimes everything is so wonderfully strange I never thought we would become one whole family again. But now we are - My, do you need more rope? - No it is good. This feels good. It looks good down here. Hi. The Axelsson family. How nice. Do you... do you have money? Monky, it's not that dangerous with water. Mr. Axelsson. Nice. - Please, can't you just swim? - I don't like this dress. - Do I have to have it? - Mother! Monky doesn't want to swim! Well, she has to bathe too! She smells like a monkey. - What if they say no? - They don't. - Look, it's just a little water. - Yeah, but... Only Axelsson has money to invest in things like this. - You don't have to be nervous. - No. No, but I'm not nervous. Okay, a little then. - Better? - I'm a little nervous... here too. There, in this area. In the lip area. There are actually children here. - You should also bathe. What? No, I'm not going to bathe! You smell like monkey, both. Come on, Monky! (cry) What are you doing in there? Monky... No, Monky, please... Not so, Monky! No no. - Here comes the drink. - Nice ducks here. - Flamingo. - Are there leaves in the drink? - They can eat. - They can eat. - Skitäckligt! - Rasmus...! Oh my God...! They have brought the monkey with them. Now it's just sharpening. Be a nice friend. - Buddy? It's a monkey. - SCH! - Hello! Hey! - Hello! We share in you. So if you can sit there and then you get to sit there. Yes, maybe you should tell us a little about this... exciting model. There are similar paths in other parts of the world. - Which goes very well. - Yes. But above all it is that we can keep open both winter and summer. - It's good for everyone. - Yes, it is very good to do so. - My, shouldn't you show then? - Yes do it. Drive. She has done really well here. We were thinking of presenting this one at... at the... village party. - I'll take this. - Yes. There are different starting points, so you can start for example here. And so you go like this... Another starting point is this. So you take the little cable car and so you just go down like this... No! And then there are the biggest trees that we will use. We have thought that it should be a bit appetizing. - Yes, you already have a mascot. - Monkey is not a mascot. - How's the security? - There are steel wires everywhere. And we take the most powerful trees. So everyone is super strong. - Then you get hooked. - And safety lines. Everyone will be able to go up here. - So you might be thinking that ...? - Going in with some money? It's not that simple. First, you need a business plan, there you describe the business and the goals. Then we need to do a risk analysis to see... Yes, if... - Monky! - Darling! Darling! - Monky! - Monky! - What is this? - I do not know. So she doesn't. So, it's the worst. (laughter and talk) (takes a picture) Why don't you get a dog instead? - Monky is not a pet. - No, she's your sister. Yes it is her. Your sister is dead. Don't you understand? She is buried in a coffin three meters below the ground. Everyone just pretends. Do you know that? To be kind to you. Everyone takes that it's just an ugly, nasty monkey. Disgusting monkey. What are you doing?! Come on, Rasmus! Come on! Come on, Rasmus! Come on, Rasmus! Yes, come on, Rasmus! Come on! Take it away! Remove the monkey! Away with you then! - No, Henry. - No, but no... No! Monky! Then loose! Let go, Monky, loose! Mother! What has happened? Monky! - Rasmus! Rasmus! - Rasmus! - Monky! - Call an ambulance! That monkey is completely insane! Monky! Monky! Monky! Where are you? Monky! Monky! Monky! Eight stitches? - Dad, don't go. - Oh my God. Eight stitches. At least eight stitches he will need to sew. In the ass. He has to take rabies, too. Four! He won't be able to sit in a week! Angelica. I'm just wondering what you're thinking... - Not another word! - Now it may actually be the final game. Build a playground for adults. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Though I just wonder what you will say. About Monky. Let's say it was a dog who bit him in the ass. But if I can see that beast again, then I call the zoo. Monky! Monky! Yes... Ambulance personnel said that... you have to kill it. For a dog that bites a child you can't keep it. It's not possible. Monky? You did it to defend me. But you mustn't be bitten, Monky. Sorry, Monky. They can't take her away from us. Now the monkeys are over! No! Don't eat with your hands, Monky. Don't forget to wash your hands, Monky. You do this when you have been on the toilet. Always. If you are going to sit in an armchair, do not do... Without you having to sit... like this. Understood? Okay, good. When eating dinner, then you sit on the chair. Not on the table. And your arms fly everywhere. You need to take it easy. You have to be concentrated. (Monky screams) Monky, I know you want to go out, but you don't get it right now. Okay? The jumps can be long, up to eight meters Family group territory on 20 to 40 acres - - Guarded and defended against other groups - Hello. - Hello Hello! Well, the whole Möllerström family are out and about? - Hello, Georg! - Hello, Vivi! - You come to the town party, huh? - Yes! Hasse so that he would make junk potato toast. Shirin will dance belly dance. (knock) Hello! Here comes Georg! Well, this is where you are? You come to the village party? No, no, but we will... we stay home tonight. I feel, too a little... risky in the throat. But you, Frank? What? Come on! (phone) Yes, yes, yes. Hi, it's Marianne. It was Jan – Ove here, zoo manager at Panterholm. Sorry to call me this, but- - I just clashed with Gunnar Svenstedt here at our staff party. Gunnar said you called about a lost gibbon monkey Yes...? We miss a gibbon monkey a month ago. Yes, I wonder, of course if you know anything about this then Hello? Are you still there? Hello? Hoo-hoo! Who wants to come along on a surprise outing? Grandmother? Where are we going? - You'll see. - Mother...! But I don't want to be away from Monky for a long time. Do you see what good are they together? A monkey! - What a nasty monkey! - Stop bumping! - Nah... Frank! Frank! - What do you want? That I should lock in my own sister and put her on a zoo in a cage. But she's not happy, Frank. No one in your house is happy anymore. We are very happy. - Mother. What are you doing? - Yes, but she's totally apathetic. And what does it mean? Apathetic? Yes it is... That's when you are so... sorry you don't want to anything at all anymore. When all the lust and joy just disappeared. Seam... Frank! She's already in a cage. You've locked her in there at home without a single little monkey buddy. Can't you be on my side? But that's me, Frank. Much more than you think. Frank. What, apathetic? Monky... Well, you're not apathetic. Okay. Take the ball and sole it right in the big brother's head now. Come on, I promise, you get to sole it right in my face. Come on! No, okay. Then I must do it myself then. Please Monky. Come on. What should I do then? Ball. Not a ball. Ouch! No, don't take me, please! But, Monky... Yes! Of course, yes. Ta-Daah! I know what I have the idea! I know, I know what to do! - What then? - I know what to do! Frank! Take it easy. Come on! Come then! Ta-Daah! - What, ta - daah? - What then, what, ta-daah? –What are you taking – daahs here for? - She has to go home. She has to go home to the jungle in Thailand. - But you're crazy. - Take-Daah! Surely it looks good? And it was you who wanted to that she would live with other monkeys. Yes, in a zoo, yes. But you can't smuggle a monkey to Thailand. Mom, was a little happy. It's you who wanted to get rid of her all the time. I just want you to feel good. And you won't in a Thai prison. Here, check it out. It's the last minute. There's one here. Here we have. There are three places. How expensive it became. Yes, but it works to buy on installment as well. - Monky, we're going to Thailand. - Corner... Come on. I wasn't going to tell you this. Because I don't want to make you sad. - Especially not you, Frank. - What is it now? - What is it? - You know this zoo we were at? Yes, before we went there then they called me. And... they told me they lack a monkey. And... a gibbon monkey. Yes, it escaped three days before it showed up here. I understand that you want something to hope for when you are sad. But sometimes it's better to see things as they are. But I do. But when... Saga died and you saw how your parents couldn't handle it. Of course it was that you found out that she was? I haven't found anything. What are you saying, Frank? Should we call the zoo and tell together? - Frank... - Okay! But first... Look Monky in the eye and say it's just a monkey. - Do it! - Okay. Grandma's sweetest little flint. But... I know it's not possible, but it is Saga's eyes. Yes, but... There must be some kind of explanation. Yes it does. It is my sister. - Are tickets still available? - Yes. Good. Buy them. - Yes, it doesn't matter. - We have them. We have them. I'm not going to let you do this to yourselves. - What are you doing? - I save you. - Hello? If you call the zoo, then, then, then, then I'll... I'll... then... Remove! - Easy... But, My ...! - Go out! Out of here! I... Sure, please. I'm just gonna... - Oh God...! - Go out! Out! - But please... - Open the door! Out, close! Monky, now you have to come home. - Paul. - Hello. Foam Bananas. - It's going to go well. - Obviously things are going well. Bye. See you. Alia. Come on. So yes. That monkey... I think I will miss her. - Well, no! Here we go. - Yes Yes. You're not taking too many now, eh? Enough as many as she can susselisussa throughout the flight. Here, Monky. No! Wait a little until we come closer to the airport. - Jan-Ove. - Yes, this is Marianne Körsell. Something terrible is happening. You have to help me stop them. - You haven't come to the police - They're going to fly! You are welcome. You can get through. Welcome. You can get through. (the machine beeps) You hold out your arms. You... the... I get so pissed off. The baby dances salsa here on my bladder. - The. - You put them in the box here. I didn't think about it at all. Welcome. You called about a lost monkey. And now they are thinking of smuggling it. Yeah, you mean our gibbon monkey? - Yes exactly. - She took a vacation - What then, vacation? She moved in to the giraffes Gibbon monkeys and giraffes thrives very well together But who was it that was going out? And fly, did you say? Monky, get up. But he can... Wait, he saw you! Mother! Monky appears. She plunged down. - Has she woken up now or? - God! Out of here. Frank. Hi. You take scumbananas, do you? Okay? You eat. Yeah? Okay? Sch! Yeah. Sch! –Ls that your monkey? - Well, it's my sister. Sister? - Good day. - Good day. This way. Monky? She is going now. So now it was well then? - COMe. - The... No, it doesn't feel good. -Sorry. This is not working. We... –Lt's not working. - No! - Yes, but she doesn't want to. It's because we don't want to. - We have to let her go. - No. We're taking her now. And so we go and bathe instead. We go to the hotel and so... - We'll take it another day. - No. Yes, we wait. We do not need hurry up this first day. - No, she has to go now. - Take it easy. - We don't take her at all. - Surely she doesn't want to. - She doesn't want to because we don't want to! - Stop now! Take her, then we go! –Sorry, we're going now. - We might come back. Maybe. Monky? –She went in? - Do you see her? - Can we ...? - Yes. She's completely gone now. How hot it is! It does not feel as i said hi then. –Go back hotel now? - Yes, yes, yes. Stop the car! (Apljud) Of course you should go. Hi, Monky. Bye. Hello then, Saga. We meet again. Dad?
