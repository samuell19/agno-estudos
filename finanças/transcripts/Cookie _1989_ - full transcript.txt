CAPISCO WAS CONVICTED OF LABOR RACKETEERING. IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT WHILE IN FEDERAL PRISON, HE CONTINUED THESE ACTIVITIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CARMINE TARRANTINO. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO OPPOSE PAROLE. GENTLEMEN, THE ISSUES HERE ARE SIMPLE. MR. CAPISCO IS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. HE HAS BEEN A MODEL PRISONER FOR THE PAST 13 YEARS. THIS OUGHT TO BE A COMPLETELY ROUTINE PAROLE HEARING, BUT MR. SEGRETTO WANTS TO BE GOVERNOR AND HAS BEEN WAGING A VENDETTA AGAINST PERSONS OF ITALIAN DESCENT IN HIS ENDLESS PURSUIT OF CHEAP, FRONT-PAGE STORIES. YOU HAVE HEARD HIS OBJECTIONS. MR. CAPISCO IS PARTNERS WITH CARMINE TARRANTINO. GENTLEMEN, THAT'S A COMPLETE FABRICATION. MR. CAPISCO HAS HAD NO SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THE PAST 13 YEARS. HIS DEVOTED WIFE BUNNY HAS BEEN FORCED TO BOARD ANIMALS TO SUPPORT HERSELF. OBJECTION. YOU SHOULD KNOW HIS WIFE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE LATE ANTONY BALLARDO, A.K.A. TONY BOY THE ARTICHOKE KING. THEIR MARRIAGE SERVED TO UNITE TWO MAJOR ORGANIZED-CRIME FAMILIES. YOU LEAVE MY FATHER OUT OF THIS! ORDER. THIS HEARING WILL COME TO ORDER, OR I'LL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT. SURELY THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE PAROLE BOARD WILL SEE THROUGH THE PROVOCATIVE INTERRUPTION BY THE PROSECUTOR AND COME TO A JUST RULING IN THIS CASE. DINO. DON'T BUY MANY NEW CLOTHES. YOU WON'T BE OUT THAT LONG. YOU KNOW HOW YOU POINT WHEN YOU TALK? I WAS NOTICING IT IN THE COURTROOM. IT HURTS YOU. IT HURTS YOUR PRESENTATION. LOOK AT MY CAR. WALL-TO-WALL DOG HAIR. WELL, EXCUSE ME!
