Subtitles: gianni zym GOOD AND EVIL Life is interesting. We will investigate it. We will take a closer look at it. Where do they live; Where can they be found every day; They lives in houses. Life takes place behind windows and doors. They move about in the rooms. Their voices penetrate the walls. They keep their things and their feelings and thoughts in the houses. The face is the first thing we notice. Faces are very different, and they are expressive. You can recognise a person by his face. We can see from the facial expression what's inside. We can see whether the person is good or bad. The face is a mirror, and it never lies. 1. The Faces Faces are different in quality. Some are beautiful, others are ugly. Just like the fact that some people are attractive, others repulsive. Eyes. Teeth. Forehead. Chin. The air. The landscapes. The roads. Next we investigated their bodies. We immediatelity notice certain differences. First of all the difference between the male and the female anatomy. The investigation of bodies soon turns into a question of taste. The difference between a biautiful body and an ugly one is obvious. Can we explain why some are rejected and others coveted? 2. The Bodies Why one category of humans is called boring and unattractive,- -whereas another is considered exiting and beautiful? They're surrounded by things. They live with their things. Things are part of their surroundings, part of their lives. Some things are used every day. They generate thoughts and feelings. Other things are not used at all. They are simply kept. Things are usually tangible. They have their particular places, so that they can be found. Most things are simply ordinary, functional things. 3. The Things But there are many useless, ugly things that nobody needs. They are there, so we cannot disregard them. I will not be forced to live his life. I want to live my own life. Yoy can do this with a shoe. If it's a good shoe, that is. I always buy good shoes. I can't stand bad shoes. Good shoes cost more, but in my experience they're worth it. I only wear good shoes. Here I stand with my sunglasses. I like using sunglasses when the sun is really bright. It's nicest to use sunglasses when the sun shines brightly. It's nice to see the world through a pair of sunglasses. They're good sunglasses. The colour suits me. I've got several. I like to change sunglasses. Change colour. Life is full of actions. At any time, people are doing things. Everybody carries out a lot of actions every single day. It is part of everyday life to be doing something. Many actions are so ordinary and simple that they are habits. Other actions are difficult and may require planning or decisiveness. The actions fill in life. 4. The Necessary Action It is each individual's daily actions that give each day meaning. Τaking action is the same as being part of life. This is a hard-boiled egg. I will remove the shell. I eat it. I like eggs. I eat eggs every day. I prefer hard-boiled eggs. I love to peel such an egg. A little salt. But no pepper. I decide what I want to think about. I hate being bored.

I guess I make my own choise But how does it actually happen? And why is it so? For example, I can choose to open the door And shut it again And I can choose to see I make my own choise But do I choose what I really want? And how can it be so? For example, I can choose to mention beauty And shatter your dream And I can choose to laugh To mention beauty, scent, things natural To shatter your dream To feel closeness and substance To break the ring of thought To be honest now I choose for myself what I want to think about But why does everything look this way? I don't understand These details are impossible to seperate So I choose to wait and see To see what happens I choose for myself what I want to think about But I've lost the ability to see and to take care of everything There's a wall with words behind it and behind the words is silence Hear the whistle of the wind hear the sound of rain I choose for myself I look terrible today. I don't know what happened. Aren't you done soon? It's disgusting. - Aren't you done soon? - You mean cutting my nails? - It sounds terrible. - Does it? - Yes. - Well, I'm almost done. Two more to go. You can't wash your hands often enough. I'm washing my hands. I'm washing my hands. I use soap and water to wash my hands. I'm washing my hands. I'm washing my hands.

Then again, it has its advantages, of course. It's really going well. That bucher should see me now. A fine tool. That's beautiful. That's baeutiful. I must say. And here. Isn't that nice?

Look at me go. I haven't cut my fingers yet. That's done. Now we'll turn it around. Let's see if I can get in between here. Now I'll cut it off the bone. Great. It's beautiful. Wonderful. I should be... ...and a professor. But I'll manage. But there are also unnecessary actions. Unnecessary actions are parts of life too. Many people spend a lot of time on unecessary actions. 5. The Unnecessary Action Generally, unnecessary actions are carried out because they're pleasant. But they don't lead anywhere. I'm smoking a cigarette. What do I like? What don't I like? What am I thinking right now? What am I thinging? I'm smoking. I'm smoking right now. I'm smoking a pipe. What do I like? And what don't I like? How am I? What am I thinking right now? Yes. What am I thinking? Ow! I'm smoking a cigarette. I'm smoking a cigarette. I'm smoking a cigarette. Tell me what you see Anything It's not important What you see is fine Tell me what you're feeling and what you're thinking And tell me what you like and what you don't like What do you like and what don't you like? The view is the same but it's raining The wind blows the waves are capped with white The trees are leafless it's winter I turn around and look at your face and your body And you take my hand You take my hand that's all right You pull it towards your face and I do nothing Tell me what you're feeling and what you're thinking Then tell me what you like and what don't you like What do you like and what don't you like? The view is the same but the sun is shining The elder flowers are wet from the summer rain You stop a car on the road that's all right You go into a place and ask you walk to a table And look around Tell me what you see Anything It's not important What you see is all right Tell me what you're feeling and what you're thinking And tell me what you like and what don't you like And tell me what you like and what don't you like. There are thoughts behind many actions. Many people do a lot of thinking every sihgle day. It's easy to see when someone is thinking. It's harder to see what the person is thinking. Often you never find out. The ability to think is indispensable in daily life. 6. Τhe Good Thoughts Thoughts lead to one decision after another. Good thoughts guide people onwards on their way trough life. Good thoughts make sense of actions and things. I get up. I have to get started. I have something to take care of. I've got to go. I get up. I have to get started. I get up. I have to get started. I have quite a few things to take care of. I'll do my best. I will do anything I can. I want to... I want to help. It will all work out. Because it's important. Yes... I'll manage. Definitely. One has to do one's best. I spend money every day. I spend a lot of money. It takes quite a lot of money to live my life. Or the kind of life I like to live. I need money. And I like to spend money. This is my son. I'm really fond of my son. I take my son in my arms. I play with him, and I feed him. I think he is so expressive. It's bliss to have children. There are no limits to thoughs. It's possible to think anything. Thought moves freely and unimpeded across land and water. Through space and flesh. Freedom of thought is boundless. Therefore, it can fly to the wrong places. It can indiate dangerous actions. Bad thoughts are the downside of the ability to think. 7.Τhe Dark Thoughts Bad thoughts are worthless and repulsive. But they exist. They are being though daily. Bad thoughts and their refuse take up quite a lot of space in life. I can't be bothered. No... Idiot! Damn it! Oh well... Thinking makes me tired. I don't want to think anymore. It's meaningless to think. - If only we had a bath tub. - Yes, that would be nice. Here we are in our nice forniture, but no bath-tub. Yes, that would be nice. Didn't I say that just now? Yes, it would be great. I think I'm going mad now. I don't want to see. I close my eyes. I don't want to choose. I don't want to make a decision. But people don't just think. They also feel. Feelings are found inside people. They are not always visible. Some feelings are so strong that they can change life. Some people are full of feelings, others are totally without feeling. Feelings are a force that makes people take action. But sometimes feelings are a huge inconvenience. 8. The Pleasant Feelings Feelings can be felt in the body, either as a pleasant energy,- - or as pain and numbness. Lack of feeling cannot be felt. I love you. I can't help it. There's nothing else to say. I love you. I love you. It's the only thing I say. I love you. I love you. - This is for you. - For me? A shirt! Did you buy me a shirt? That's sweet of you. - Aren't you going to open it? - Yes. - What a nice colour. - Don't you think it'll suit you? Yes. I'll just remove the pins. There are so many damn pins. - Will you help me? - No. I'll pour you coffee. A good, strong cup of coffee. I know that's how you like it. You take neither sugar nor milk. I love you. A good, strong cup of coffee. Just the way I like it. I take neither sugar nor milk. I love you. I'm drinking coffee. I spend a lot of money. I spend a lot of money every day. I need a lot of money to live the kind of life I want to live. I spend money every day. I spend a lot of money every day. Feelings can also be inconvenient. Unpleasant. They can disturb daily actions that make every day look like yesterday. Feelings can go inwards and outwards. 9. The Unpleasant Feelings They can be seen as flowering beauty or morbid obsessions. There is no need for unpleasant feelings, but they can't be removed. Unpleasant feelings penetrate everywhere. I spill coffee on you. I spilled coffee on you by accident. Sorry about that. I didn't do it on purpose. You mustn't be angry. You spilled coffee on me. You poured coffee down me. It hurts. The coffee was hot. My new trousers will be stained. It's hard to remove coffee stains. That's a shame. They're brand-new trousers. I think the stains will come out when they're dry-cleaned. Coffee stains can be removed, as long as there isn't any milk in it. There was no milk in that cup. I'm sorry I made you cry. I'm sorry for speaking to you like that. I shouldn't have said those things on a day like today. Don't think about it. You don't, do you? I look terrible too. I'll go and have a shower and a cigarette. I'll feel much better when you get back. I'll be ever so nice. I'm sorry I made you cry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I made you cry. I'm sorry. No... No, it isn't over. It can't be over. Just don't say anything... No. It hurts. It's not right. I guess I make my own choise But how does it actually happen? And why is it so? I can for example choose to open the door And shut it again And I can choose to see I'm sorry I made you cry. I'm sorry I made you cry. I'm sorry I made you cry. I make my own choise But do I choose what I really want? And how can it be so? For example, I can choose to mention beauty And shatter your dream And I can choose to laugh To mention beauty scent thing of nature To shatter your dream To feel closeness and substance To break the ring of thought To be honest now I choose for myself what I want to think about But why does everything look this way? I don't understand These details are impossible to sepatate So I choose to wait and see To see what happens I choose for myself what I want to think about But I've lost the ability to see and to take care of everything There's a wall with words behind it and behind the words is silence Hear the wistle of the wind hear the sound of rain I choose for myself. For the first time in my life I feel like stabbing someone with a knife. I feel like killing you. What I haven't put up with. I trusted and trusted you and... When the chips are down... When our friendship was really put to the test... You turn out to be a shit. A selfish bastard. Don't hold my neck. I don't like it. Why not? Does it feel like coercion? I don't care for it. I don't like it. There are many words in life. Words that are whispered and words that are called out. And there are words that are not spoken. Words can explain any act. Words can make sense of things, thoughts and feelings. People can lie with words or tell the truth. They can touch each other with words. 10. The Words They can use words to kill time or to break the silence. Words fill in the void between bodies. Bossa nova rhythms I don't mind at all. Bossa nova rhythms I don't mind at all. Bossa nova rhythms I don't mind at all. Bossa nova rhythms I don't mind at all. Bossa nova rhythms I don't mind at all. What are you thinking? I'm not thinking anything. - Do you like to make love to me? - Yes. I like to make love to you. - Do you? - Yes. Sometimes they also do this. - We always do, right? - Yes. - They don't have to do it. - What else? What more do they do? This. But they know that. Stop it now. I'm not saying any more if you have to write down everything. Get out! You've slept in my bed. You've fucked me,- - you've stolen my words. Now get out! I want to sleep now. I'm drinking my tea. I'm sitting on my chair. Not too comfortably. I look at the wall without seeing anything in particular. I focus on the other person. I'm not sure of anything. I feel quite all right. I don't know what I want. I'll have to wait and see. I don't think I know much. I'm an old man. I enjoy the simple pleasures. Sometimes I think back on my life. I've experienced many peculiar, but also wonderful things. I've had many good friends. I live the quiet life now. I tend my garden. I sicialize with a few people, whose company I appreciate. I am an elderly gentleman who enjoys good whisky. And a pipe with Moroccan grass. And a long night of undisturbed sleep. Black Nepal is too strong for me. But I've lost the ability to see and to take care of everything There's a wall with words behind it and behind the words is silence Hear the whistle of the wind hear the sound of rain I choose for myself. Today, too, I experienced something I hope to understand in a few days. Aroynd my left hand was a shiny ring of hazy white flames. In the middle of my heart there was a small white spot. I don't know what it means. Subtitles: gianni zym
