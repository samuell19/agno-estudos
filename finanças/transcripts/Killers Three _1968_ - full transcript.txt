-NEWSREADER: Atlantic City. -[APPLAUSE] Tension mounts as the balloting for Miss America 1947 comes down to the wire. It's a tough decision for the judges as they survey this bevy of beauties. But when the winner is announced, the audience unanimously approves the judges' decision. We present to you, the new Miss America. [CROWD CHEERING] In North Carolina, moonshine liquor is still big business. Federal agents, their ranks now bolstered with returning veterans are ready for this full scale war. And it looks like war is what they'll get from these illegal traffickers. These stills are destroyed. But thousands more are hidden deep in the swamps and forests of the South. This new war has just begun. In New York, a famous general exchanges... -[GRUNTS] -What's the matter, Johnny? Oh, nothing. Oh, you. Meed wants me, I got to go. What about? Tell you later. [TRAIN HORN BLOWING IN DISTANCE] You remember Roger's coming. Can you take him to home, huh? Guess, I can. -You take care of your mommy, you hear? -[CAR HORN HONKS] Uh-huh. Johnny, why is your old army buddy coming down here? [HONKING] Hold on, Homer. I got to go. Honey, if I'm right, we'll make it out of here. We'll have it made. We don't need nothing, except you. [HONKING] Bye. [ENGINE STARTS] There goes that phony sheriff's car. They got to be right in there. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] It's the Sheriff. Probably got that new driver with him. This ain't no business for a scrawny kid like that. Well, come on! Get the lead out of your tail. Mr. Meed said to be here by 4:00. It's 4:00 now, Homer. See? The big hand's on the 12 and the little hand's on the four. You're a real smart boy, ain't you? I don't count on my fingers. Yeah. You're real smart. So smart you come home from the army and marry that tramp gal with the bastard kid. You smartass. All right, boy. [SIGHS] I'm going to teach you a lesson. Hold it, Johnny! You stupid slob. Get your big-bellied monkey suit in the car and get out of here! You make one hell of a target for these revenuers around here. Well, get on back to work! You like driving for me, boy? Ain't too many jobs to be had for an illiterate country boy like you around here. Leastwise not of the kind of money I'm paying you. Now you remember that! You've been with me three weeks. Homer Brown's been with me nigh onto 18 years. He's a moron. He's a moron. Moron that gets all stood up in his pants every time he sees that pretty young wife of yours. No telling what would happen if we was to put you out of circulation for a while. Just, uh, just making a point. A man either works for me or he don't. One way or the other, he don't give me no sass. [SCOFFS] Boy, I want you to be careful on this run down to Siler City. MAN: Attention! Attention! I'm with the federal government. Put your hands up and come on out. Bye-bye. Come on back.

The man runs a million dollars worth of moonshine out of over a dozen stills in these mountains every year. Hmm. [SIGHS] Now, that's good. Now, why in the hell can't we arrest him? We both saw him there. Hell, we can take him to court. In this country, my boy, you have to have evidence. Right now there are probably three judges and a, a congressman who would swear that that was a church that blew up out there. Yeah, I guess you're right. It would take an air-tight case to hold a jury together around here. [SIGHS] Ah. If only we could have gotten the license off of that car that got away. Hey, I recognized that punk kid. His name is Johnny Warder. Who the hell is Johnny Warder? Yeah, some kid that's working for Lester Meed. He's driving for him. He's money-hungry, I understand. Now, this one we can tag.

Yeah, it's been in the family quite a while. Whatcha got going? Well, like I told you in the letter, I finally found a way to California. Takes money, John. Sit down, Roger. By late tomorrow, we'll be heading down Route 66 with 200,000, half of it yours. Where are you and me going to make that kinda money? No, we ain't making it. We're taking it from my boss. I run booze for a moonshiner. [SOFTLY] That's against the law, John. Yeah? That's what the revenuers say. No, I mean the stealing. It's okay to steal this, it's illegal dough. You told me he was just passing through. All right, so I lied. Ain't that the truth? I should have known. Roger didn't even know till a few minutes ago.

Elvira, will you show Roger around? I'm gonna show you everything. I know he's funny-looking. It's not his fault. You go in and lie down a while, all right? He's a good man. He knows all about explosives. The army taught him. You just won't listen, will ya? Why won't you listen to me? No, I won't listen to you when you're talking foolish. You and that pitiful person. Talk about robbing people and blowing up safes. No, I won't listen to any of that. What do you think I'm doing this for? I don't know why you're doing it. Why, it's for us. For you and me and Tony.

We won't be bringing Tony today. Oh, aren't you going to the dance? A lot of folks are bringing their children. We thought we'd bring him along. I reckon he'll have all the little girls turning their heads. Is something bothering you, sugar? How's Johnny doing? -Hey, Johnny. -Huh? Hear them revenuers had some trouble yesterday. I hear they almost caught them a runner. Is that a fact? You know, Tony and Carol deserve something better than to have you spread all over the highway. I reckon they do, Charlie. But I reckon it's up to me to see your sister gets something better. [DOOR OPENS] Your friend's calling you. I did it, John. It's right here. See in that bottle there's enough nitro to blow up half the town. Just keep it to one safe, huh, Roger? It's no problem. You just mix it in with the oatmeal like this, little bit at a time. Even little Tony could handle it. But, see, you got to take the lumps out. Good oatmeal doesn't have any lumps. Just go easy, Roger. Hmm. We got everything.

Johnny, why don't you let her go? Charlie, I don't think you understand. He's not making me stay. You know what I'm gonna have to do? Carol, I guess I'm not a very good cop. 'Cause I'm gonna leave, but we'll be back in about 10 minutes. And don't be here. No! [CAROL SCREAMS] [CAROL SCREAMING] -That's her brother! -CAROL: No! [BOTH YELLING] We gotta get out of here. Let's go! CAROL: "I saw a ship a-sailing "Sailing o'er the sea "And, oh! But it was laden with pretty things for me "There were comfits in the cabin "And sweetmeats in the hold "And the sails were all made of silk "And the masts made all of gold "There were four and 20 sailors "That stood upon the deck "There were four and 20 white mice "With chains about their necks "And the Captain was a duck "With a jacket on his back "And when the boat began to move "The Captain said, 'Quack, quack!'" Good night, Tony. Good night, Mama. -Good-bye. -Good-bye. Promise me, he'll be with us again. Promise me. I promise. I promise, Carol. ROGER: Johnny. John. [WHISPERS] There's somebody out there.
