JUST DON'T THINK I'LL SCREAM I watched over 400 films between April and October 2016. This footage comes from them. I'm 45 years old. I've lived for 6 years, in an apartment in a tiny, picturesque Alsace village about 50 kms from Strasbourg, in the Northern Vosges national park. 7 months ago, I separated from my partner with whom I'd decided to settle here to be close to nature and live more comfortably than our income permitted in Paris. I knew the village as I had shot a short film there and my mother, after remarrying, moved to a neighboring village. When we broke up, I had no driving license in this lonely place where people watch behind the veiled curtains of their windows, all decorated with geranium planters. The Alsatian dialect is omnipresent. I rarely hear French, and even then, it's dreadfully polluted by germanisms. The nearest station is 30 kms away, there are no buses, no local shops or even a cash machine within a 2-hour walk. I suffer this exile, far from Paris, in this place where the opulence of nature hides from the untrained eye the Protestant, almost always right-wing stiffness of its inhabitants. Most of them grew up here. School, soccer club, marrying a local girl: work, family, village. When you come from the next village, you're already a foreigner. The locals build or renovate large houses with gardens to show they live well, cleanly, decently. They live well. Major companies in the region are still hiring. There are 3 churches for 500 people. It's hard to quench one's thirst for culture. There's a book corner which is mainly used by pink, chubby kids. Less than 20 adults visit it regularly. In summer, countless tourists march past my windows. They spend 45 minutes visiting old troglodytic dwellings. There are a few dances dominated by polkas and German light music. At times, you might think you were 50 years ago. Or 75 years ago. Obviously, the election results are chilling. The people I've met here and love live in isolation. It's wise to withdraw. Exchanges are rare. My only relations with the outside world are bimonthly raids on the nearest supermarket, driven by my mother, and Sunday meals which at least give me some human contact. In November, I played a hermit in a friend's film. Before we'd finished, the terrorists struck in Paris. The next day, a state of emergency was declared. I face the start of the year with apprehension, disgust and fear. Here, there's nobody to exchange ideas with, let alone share them. I know I should leave, return to Paris, and reconnect with my friends and peers. That's materially impossible. This winter isn't particularly cold. It hasn't been for several years. It's just sorry and sad, indifferent and grey, apart from some shafts of light in the late afternoon. The woods are bare, nature dull and asleep. I hardly ever leave home, and when I do, the solitary walker isn't in a state of mind that favors reverie. He feels helpless and wounded. I discovered a drunken solitude which gradually turned into vertigo. Living alone is the pleasure of living at my pace. I don't sleep much. I have 18-hour days at my disposal. Apart from daily obligations: feeding the animals and myself, keeping the place in order. My retirement gives me a lot of spare time. I'm too feverish to read for long and I don't see anyone. I don't see the outside world. I try to think of it through the films that I see day and night. It's almost my only occupation, except for selling on the internet, which keeps me going between jobs. Like a rural Vernon Subutex, I sell discs, DVDs, and books on the web. Twice a week, I ship to the whole world: I print order forms, I pack, I tape, I bubblewrap, I stamp, I mail. It kills a little time. Otherwise, 3, 4, even 5 films a day. Since the break-up, the pace has picked up. Today, there are mountains of DVDs in every corner. Thousands of them. And over the years I have become a formidable internet film digger. Illegal downloading has no secrets for me, from warez sites to Youtube channels, I pick out whatever intrigues me, films I never had access to and always wanted to see, the most improbable discoveries: silent movies out of copyright, pre-Code Hollywood gems, incunabula of Soviet cinema, Scandinavian erotic films, gialli, pink films, German dramas, 70s Euro-thrillers... Anything goes, and I can't stop. I manage my downloads, I archive, I go to bed, and I start again the next day. I literally sink into others' films, lose all desire to write, film, do anything other than watch others' films. The nest becomes a niche, the refuge a prison. And others' films are no more than mirrors, not windows. I always face the screen, in the 3-seater sofa in the living room. At my side, the ghost's chair, which cruelly reminds me of the most difficult moment endured within these walls. That was almost 3 years ago. My father was found dehydrated in his small apartment. He lived alone. A week in hospital and a positive checkup, except for his very low morale. I'd only seen him about 15 times in 20 years. I'd gone from hating him as a teenager to silence, then indifference. During the 2 decades that had passed since I left home, I had grown without him, or rather, against him. My brothers still saw him sometimes whereas I'd lost touch. I agreed to see him again after many years, when he sought to get closer to his children he knew so little and so to his eldest son, me, who had always clashed with him. We saw each other once or twice a year for long, embarrassed afternoons when so as not to open old wounds and hurt each other, we ended up saying almost nothing over a board game. These rare but boring moments gave me a good conscience at little cost. These lukewarm reunions must have done him good, and I no longer felt the will to refuse him. The hospital doctors, worried by his depressive state, had prescribed a stay in a nursing home, advising him not to return home alone. Admission could not take place for a week. My brothers couldn't take care of him during that time, so I reluctantly agreed to take him in. I went through the first days with an irritation I had trouble hiding. That of feeding, caring for this dull, totally disoriented father who kept, despite his confusion, his stubbornness, defeatism, machismo, resentment, narrow outlook from a time I hadn't known, from which he hadn't escaped. A father I had nothing in common with. My father. My father. The Tour de France. The railroad. Parades. The accordion. Que sera, sera. "The Priest's Maid" song. Sport. Le Douanier Rousseau. His obsolete idea of virility, conjugality, paternity. The animal TV shows. Soccer. Charlie Hebdo. Betting. My father born in 1940. Lower middle class. The postwar boom. His modest dreams. The fear of what people will say if you step out of line. Of not making ends meet. My father. Dissatisfied. Bitter. Beaten. He never supported my choices. "In film, everyone sleeps around. Artists are all fags." He never supported me at all. Only he ever used the loathsome nickname, Frankus. At the hospital, he insisted on hugging me and saying what he'd never said: that he loved me. My father. My antinomy. I make the necessary effort. But conversations falter and quickly die out. Time slows down, minutes weigh tons. His distress prevents him from concentrating or killing time with Scrabble games or TV shows. He is helpless. Sleeps little. Confuses his meds. Wakes up way before us. Goes round in circles. His gestures betray his inner agitation. He knows something's wrong. He's revolted by the idea of psychiatric treatment. I wait to be relieved, for time to pass, for when I'm relieved of a responsibility that crushes me. Evenings are the most trying. On the 4th or 5th day, I remember his admiration for Charles Vanel. A patriarchal figure as he liked them à la Gabin, Bourvil, Pierre Fresnay, Noël-Noël. I thought he might enjoy Grémillon's "The Sky is Yours", a film from his childhood. After 30 minutes, unlike the previous nights, he is still awake in his chair. He seems to follow it. I'm pleased I've found something that interests him or at least doesn't leave him totally apathetic. I share a film I love with my father, which is a first. When his legs suddenly rise and spasm, I don't immediately get what's happening. The mechanical movement recurs. His arms too begin to beat the air. My friend sees it's a malaise and rushes to him. I finally realize. I'm tetanized. On screen, Madeleine Renaud flies off. My father loses consciousness. I'm paralyzed. My friend takes charge. Taps him on the cheek to bring him round. Icy water. Gets him on the floor. My friend compresses his sternum. Helpless, I grab on to his arms. I try to find the words. We need an ambulance. It'll take 30 minutes. My father briefly opens his eyes, whispers incoherent words. He recognizes me, says a few forgettable words: "No point resisting. When you gotta go, you gotta go." And he faints again. He never comes back. It's over. He came to my house to die. I saw a man die before my eyes, in my arms. I don't understand. I'm angry. His last words specifically make me angry. Why to me? Why here? Why now? And why die in front of a movie? Why "The Sky is Yours"? I've relived this scene for months. I thought I'd die 100 times in front of every movie since. Nervous impulses, tightness in the chest, sharp tingling in the fingers and toes. The absurd, incessant idea that it's my turn next, that this spectator's place is now linked to death. And yet I didn't abandon it. Almost 3 years later, in April 2016, I still occupy it. In Alsace, where the Napoleonic regime was never repealed, church is not officially separated from state. People fiercely defend, out of pride and by a sacrosanct respect for tradition, its anachronistic singularity. Catechism is still taught in school. It seems normal for priests to be paid by the taxpayer and in the land of the stork, they are ready to defend the two additional holidays granted by this obsolete status. They don't work on December 26 or Good Friday. No reform has overcome these regional privileges. Easter is lived as a 2nd Christmas with obscene family reunions around a leg of lamb, the egg hunt organized for the youngest by the old folk they call, in a tribal atavism and a rigid deference to the past, the "elders". Every opportunity to consume, to feast, to have a last drink because "we've earned a day off", to show off one's prosperous well-being, one's blond, docile brood, is worth taking. There's no trifling with holy days, traditions or respectability. I have nothing to celebrate, certainly not the resurrection of Christ. The days grow longer, the temperature rises timidly. It's spring. Like every year, the grass turns green again, the cuckoos and dandelions appear. I pull my basket out of a closet and pick greenery for Sarah Jane, the rabbit I put on my balcony, shortly after I arrived. I do this so I go out at least once a day, to get some air and interrupt the things I do frantically to avoid being faced with myself. I haven't been able to write for ages, so it's intolerable to feel unoccupied. I avoid feeling idle by considering everything as work: sorting my records, folding laundry, fixing meals, watching films. I know that if boredom were to enter my solitude, it would be too real for me to continue to cherish it. The gaps plugged by my routine could give way. I'd be forced to look at the face I see in the mirror when I wake up: the single 40-year-old with puffy features, bloodshot eyes, soft complexion, muscles and belly. The first woe of the day. Is that the face I deserve? And what does it mean? My failures? My inner fights? 20 years of sleepless nights? My weaknesses? My addictions? My resignations? I feel I've become a tragicomic character in a Blake Edwards film: a little man pinned up by a midlife crisis without warning and who rush into a maze of pathetic lies and pettiness, in search of carefree lost youth rather than a real second wind. But we love them because, despite their cowardice, they're shown with the tender cruelty of he who imagines them and watches them struggle. These fictional characters fall back on their feet. No-one looks at me. My reflection in the mirror inspires no leniency in me. So I close the shutters and return to my screen, the place of magnificent obsessions where the mirages of life seem sublime. The country, that of newspapers, information, especially cities, stations, airports, administrations, theaters is still in a state of emergency. Those in power maintain their best ally: fear, using police controls, military surveillance, and raids. They call for a sense of duty and citizens' vigilance, stir up mistrust and suspicion, brandish and misuse the tired rags of Republican values. The watchdogs toy with secularism, national sovereignty and freedom. Ideas don't circulate - ramparts, screens, scarecrows, fetishes do. In the village, where I speak to no-one, this security trance is imperceptible. The only uniforms or flashing lights you see are the fire department or the police who settle a dispute between neighbors or record a suicide. A bit more here than elsewhere, people hang themselves and choose to end it all. In Strasbourg, as in all of France, people have begun to rise up at night reacting against a moribund government whose only program is capitalism. I'm intrigued by these debates and even think, at times, of taking a closer look. I naturally support resistance to the dictatorship of profitability over maintaining plutocracy and nepotism. Activists have always appealed to me. But my mistrust of collective movements and group ideologies quickly takes over. On my computer, I follow the evolution of "Nuit Debout" ("Rise Up At Night"), a few friends' fervent commitments, but I know I don't belong and I feel it's a losing battle. I question those who went, those who were mere observers, a few others who were more involved, but my close friends are unanimously skeptical. We're wary it could be taken over and mock the adolescent candor of the debates and the appearance of hot dog stands at the demonstrations. My approval and support remain theoretical, silent, without effect. Deep down, maybe I find this form of protest too gentle, too conciliatory. I feel too old for the revolution, which we're a long way from, and too young for renunciation. I'm in a no man's land of doubt and contained anger. Lost, disillusioned, on the fringes of events, probably lagging behind as well. I go to Paris at the end of the month. It does me good. It gives me this renewed pleasure each time I arrive to mingle with a myriad of different passers-by. The same aesthetic euphoria grips me each time. Everyone is beautiful with their differences: skin color, clothing style, pace, behavior. They walk the streets of Paris with their diversity yet singularity. As if everyone's inner music were unique and became perceptible to me. In the village, almost everyone has the same complexion, physiognomy, and walk. I almost forget the image, albeit recent, of the watching soldiers in fatigues, machine-gun over the shoulder, dog on a leash, pacing the station platforms. Prince dies the day I arrive. I remember his special place in my adolescent fantasies, the arousal this sensual creature caused, his ruffled shirts, the color purple, his black, exciting, vicious eyes. Then, the evenings, drinks, and lunches flash past. I give myself up, at first, to the joy of seeing old friends, those with whom time rushes by. Those with whom discussions are easy and obvious, references shared, agreement implicit. I spend the week with an ex lover, near my old home, in Paris's smallest avenue which leads to Sacha Guitry's tomb and Montmartre cemetery. I break with the countryside's ascetic rhythm. Here no films, no obligations. Nights are liquid, often intoxicating. Afternoons go slowly in the kitchen, bathed in grey light, doing some reading at last. My ex's roommate tells me she intends to move out. It is decided that when she left, at the latest in the autumn, I'd get her room. The rent is reasonable for Paris, i.e. very expensive for me, but I see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'll follow it, I'll leave. I return to Alsace, exhausted by the excesses, and come to grips with the sudden return to the silent monotony. At first, I am nevertheless invigorated by the prospect of soon leaving this place where I've talked to my ghosts for so long. Relieved to have decided to go, however adventurous it may be materially. But typically, the initial enthusiasm soon gives way to anxiety and vertigo, faced with all the tasks to accomplish. Over the years, I've accumulated lots of furniture and objects. And because of my obsessive nature, I'm overwhelmed by thousands of books, vinyl records, CDs, and DVDs. So much so that I've gradually colonized the attic. Going from 100 square metre to 20, I can't keep everything. There'll be a battle between my attachment to these objects and the fact that I've buried myself under these films, songs, and pages and have become the consenting captive. My Stockholm syndrome. They're, literally and figuratively, walls, fortifications, pyramids to be demolished. But I firmly believe this painful sacrifice is necessary. I don't define myself by what I own. My identity doesn't consist of shelves. I have to dump ballast to get back up to the surface, to the light of day, though it seems so dull to me. This forced decluttering will free from all this cultural jumble what really matters. Choosing between the indispensable and the superfluous, the essential and the decorative. I know that the process will be difficult. Luckily, I have a few months to go. I decide to proceed cubic meter by cubic meter, cut back drastically, without sentimentality or dishonesty, sell things off on the net, even at low prices, put a little money aside for the move. Give to friends baroque music, Marguerite Duras, Cecil de Mille. Donate the books I won't read to the local library. Get rid of, restrict, diminish, empty. I need boxes, energy, discernment, and time. I'm working on it. I alternate clearing and films. On good days, I make progress. On bad days, I see only the Dantesque aspect of the task. Like Sisyphus in pretzel land, I feel I'm bailing out a boat. At my windows, the month of May struggles to raise the temperature, the rain never stops, soaking forest and paths, stifling the ringing bells every 15 minutes, day and night, that reach the 2nd floor of my home. I abandon myself to the dreary succession of days without light and without words, except for the dialogue on social media with people like me who can't sleep. After the last film of the day, at 1 AM, I deaden my mind with music, beer and joints so as not to ruminate too much and relax, think about something else, talk, play, download, forget that the next day will be like the day before. I go to bed at sunrise. A dreamless sleep finally falls on me. Another day without absolutes. Nothing disturbs the routine of my days which are all the same. Screen, keyboard, packages, boxes, cat, rabbit, dinner alone. It's raining. I read Virginie Despentes. It's raining. I watch American films for a festival's selection. It's raining. I listen to rap, revel in Dooz Kawa, Les Chevals Hongrois, Lucio Bukowski. It challenges me, looks the world in the eye, oscillates between bitter observation, poetic dazzling, and the search for light. One day, I get a call from a couple of Portuguese director friends. They're not far away, on their way back to Lisbon and suggest they call in. Less than 2 hours later, the two Joãos are in my kitchen. The sky has courteously cleared. We spend 2 days, discussing the complicated shoot of their last film and eating and drinking. We walk in the rainy forest, watching birds, gleaning wild mint we used just after the walk for improvised cocktails. A delicate parenthesis of empathy, fantasy, and jokes that sadly closes too soon. I think about the film I want to make and try to go beyond a draft. The diary or chronicle formats seem the solution. I question the legitimacy of my words and the relevance of my approach. Using the first person singular: isn't the gesture vain? I've only kept a diary for a few days due to a lack of perseverance and a fear of sinking into introspective onanism, of not finding the distance to relay and analyze the events that punctuate my existence and my era. Platitude, narcissism, pride, dishonesty, self-pity seem to be the genre's many possible pitfalls. How to avoid them? And doesn't this undertaking, based on the use of images I ingest, hide a Machiavellian construction of my sick mind to justify my cine-folly? I conceive this project with the idea of becoming less passive, making my film bulimia dynamic and fruitful. But I'm like an addict who decides not to quit his habit, but to observe and comment on them. Is putting it at a distance just illusory? The project involves the maintenance of my addiction and maybe an increase of this addiction. How to free myself from my fatal attraction for films, an aesthetic rampart against the vile world? I persuade myself that the main thing at the moment is to ask these questions, not answer them. That's lucky - I couldn't. In my valley where folklore rhymes with identity, so-called cultural events are usually limited to theatrical farces in dialect or harvest festivals. I'm surprised to discover a concert by Françoiz Breut whose career I have followed. The opening act is a regional blues singer who I've also been following. All this is in a remote village I don't recall ever going to. I go there with my mother. Miraculously, the evening is mild and bright. They perform in the open air, against the backdrop of the hilly fields, made iridescent by a lazily setting sun. The audience is attentive, smiling, discreet. Urchins and ragamuffins roam the grass by the stage, carefree. This evening that stretches generously till after 12 AM is a happy exception. It's like another place and another time. Françoiz Breut doesn't sing "Ecran Total". I heard it a few days before. It starts: "Flashes in the reflection of his eyes He looks for light in an abyss He seems full of illusions Eyes riveted on the screen" I inevitably return to the screen. I download 100 Soviet movies in 3 days and immerse myself in East German films. My attraction for this communist cinema probably comes from the fact that its characters question their place in society, their function, their usefulness in a collective utopia. They question power and work, the exercise of authority, education, the transmission of history. The hero of the East is in a dialectical relationship with the world, like a cog supposed to produce an egalitarian society. He is driven by an ideal. I don't mind that this posture stems from ideological indoctrination. His dignity makes him seem more amiable to me than the Western character, determined by a narrow idea of pleasure which is an inalienable right. The latter rarely defines himself by his citizenship. Above all, he claims his singularity. He thinks he's out of the ordinary. One dreams and produces, the other consumes. In early June, it's often stormy here. One night, a sandstone rock above the village falls onto the roof of a neighbor who had threatened my crew with a gun a few years ago when I was filming nearby. The incident makes me laugh. I receive a new computer that I infest with viruses within 3 days. My old lover I have to move in with in the fall helps me. We spend a week reinstalling programs, disinfecting USB ports, booting, rebooting, querying specialist forums. And drinking. And eating. And sharing movies. I want to puke up the last few days' news. It's just happened in the land of Titian and Pasolini. You can now buy "Mein Kampf" everywhere. It doesn't bother people much. All's well. In Florida, a fanatic just shot 50 people in a gay club. Each day relentlessly brings its share of amazement, despair, and mourning that keeps me inside and encourages my social autism. I'm on the brink of defeatism and resignation. But something inside me keeps screaming. It's deafening. My friend and I are going back to Paris. He pushes me to make the journey by carpool. I tell myself that I'll stuff myself with tranquilizers and pretend to sleep. As soon as we put our bags next to the golf clubs of the driver, not much older than us, I feel he's a satisfied embodiment of the new economic order. He doesn't smoke in the car. He has a start-up and listens to standardized world music. He talks, because with carpooling, you meet different people. He brags about his wife, his kids, his certainties, his success, his trips abroad. "I sell apps to hotel chains that detect customers' movements and purchases to influence them. What do you do?" I keep quiet and bite my tongue. In my head, the lyrics of a song by Zippo I discovered not long ago: "Now I Have An Axe." People are shouting on the Boulevard de Clichy when we arrive. Almost at once I regret having come when I see the drunk, yelling horde at the giant screen, set up by City Hall, to broadcast some soccer match. This public gathering doesn't contravene the state of emergency. I guess you have to let go of the bridle. Nothing better than soccer to stifle dissension, divert attention, create the illusion "We're all together". A useful distraction! I drag my luggage through the noisy mass of painted faces. The soccer tricolor. Collective fervor, triumphant idiocy, beery chauvinism. The splendor of the supporter! All week, I open the window and inhale the stench of piss and puke deposited in the night, which flow in lumpy streams in the gutter. All week, bawdy songs, quarrels, insults, screams, outbursts of violence rip my sleep apart. Now that the date for my move is set for early October, I doubt my decision and wonder whether the hostile village isn't better than this sad cheerful crowd. I resist the temptation of the synecdoche, but this part isn't a whole. It isn't the tricolor that the opponents of the Labor Law wave on June 14, eager to curb the liberal excesses of a government that blithely scorns its electorate and its citizens. Some of them still stand up to defend their trampled rights for being cynically humiliated by political cadres, pimped by employers, subservient to big business. To those who resist Huxley's Brave New World, of 60 years ago, they retort with batons, tear gas, and water cannons. The riot police's caresses. Lazy, resigned, I have no hope in the outcome of the clashes. I support the demonstrators from my bed, rejoicing at the black bloc's chaos. I dream of burned banks, stoned police stations, a new disorder. On social media, a few days later, I see a quote by Hermann Hesse posted by an unknown friend: "I'm thirsty for violent sensations, a fury against this neutral, flat, regulated, sterilized existence, an urge to ransack something: a department store or a cathedral or myself, commit a folly, tear the wigs off a few respected idols, help schoolchildren in revolt to go on a liner, wring the neck of bourgeois representatives. That's what I hate, curse and abominate from the depths of my heart: this bliss, health, comfort, this neat optimism, this fat, prosperous breeding of mediocre folk." Back to the countryside. The shelves are emptying slowly, too slowly. The mass is barely decreasing. Between films, I go around in circles. I'm working on music my Lisbon friends asked me to prepare for the opening of an exhibition on them. This invitation to Portugal would be very timely if the prospect of a trip wasn't enough to make me anxious. I have toothache coming on. It gets worse every day. Somatization? Hypochondria? I'm wary of my body and mind's reactions to anxiety. I only feel a slight pain, but I feel it about to erupt. I down painkillers in the hope of curbing the pain. The journey is like an adventure: to reach the small coastal town, I go by car and train, spend a night in Strasbourg, then a dawn bus without having slept to a German airport and fly to Porto. Another 30 minutes on the subway before finally meeting my friends, completely absorbed by the last problems before the opening. There was a bomb attack in Turkey before I left and during my stay, Iraq on July 3, then Syria, on July 5, count their dead. I have no wish to laze in the sun or to walk in the alleys I know by heart. I read in my hotel room for hours till it's time to play music. I've made a selection that refers to my friends' cinematographic universe. I insert the waltz composed by David Mansfield for "Heaven's Gate". The director's world is far from that of my friends who respect him without idolizing him, but it seems to me this waltz belongs here in the melancholy of the windy Portuguese twilight. The celebration is ending. I'm glad I did it, despite my apprehension and lack of practice. I'm pleased to see some friends. I'm introduced to unknown faces. I have a last drink. I turn my phone back on. I suddenly discover, as I scroll through the news, that Michael Cimino is dead. It's disastrous irony. A cruel twist of fate. The coincidence disturbs me. The next day, we drive back to Lisbon. I like spending time with my friends, but I can't enjoy this holiday. My teeth hurt, I absorb lots of medicine, I only leave my room so as not to be unpleasant to my hosts. Death strikes where it wants this summer which is off to a bad start. Abbas Kiarostami dies next. I remember his film, "The Passenger", one evening when we braved the soccer fans pouring into the subway, streets and squares. This effervescent crowd seems much less repugnant than the one which bawled, in the stink of warm beer and testosterone, 2 weeks earlier under Parisian skies. We discover Jean Renoir's "Night at the Crossroads" at the Lisbon Cinematheque and I fall asleep that night, dreaming of turtles and opiates. On the way back, I impose an adult behavior on myself: I contact a dentist. He disinfects, treats, descales, drills, takes impressions, crowns, and plenty more besides. To avoid joining the cohort of the toothless, I plan weekly appointments until the move and sacrifice the nest egg which was to facilitate my departure to the bill which awaits me. On July 14, the village flea market is invariably held. With my sleep pattern, I'm not in bed when the first stands are put up before daybreak. The bar, which will work non-stop till late at night, serves the first drinkers. I lie down, protected from the noise by my closed windows and shutters. I emerge a few hours later, dragged from sleep by a mute, undulating sound, as if clouds of insects were buzzing in my skull. When I open the windows, a human tide unfurls at my feet, a dissonant symphony produced by hundreds of performers who stroll from one stand to another. A torrent roaring with chatter, interjections, and loud cries. Purses click on all sides. The objects, in frozen expectation of a second life, are weighed and negotiated. They hunt for a bargain buried in the dirt and dust: a magic trinket, a sacred rosary, a Renaissance pushchair, an unknown masterpiece under a rustic crust. The seasoned salesmen pitch, invent a new mythology for each bauble to people whose glance happens to linger on a wax doll with no eyes or a wobbly stool. An occasional slap is given to a kid, the "You deserved that" that accompanies it, and the subsequent screams. Or a nauseous accordion that suddenly intensifies and reaches my ears. If that's the people I've lived with for months, why end my solitude? I close the shutters, plunging the living room into reassuring darkness. But this improvised safeguard barely mutes the outside roar. I sit at the computer, put headphones on, turn the volume up, roll a joint, abandon myself to the music. I listen to new music on my virtual strolls, watch clips, and find a track, already 3 years old, that perfectly coincides with my mood. A vexed, annoyed mood that has always gripped me on holidays. Even more oppressive are the national holidays when people strut and parade. The days of pride and historical contentment. The song is "La France des Epiciers" by Gontard. It goes: "See, Grandpa? They give us the same toys Religion, selfishness, glory Fine crimes in prime time Trains that derail And all this fetishism over the flag How can you worship a piece of cloth?" I listen to it 2, 3, 4 times. To overcome my first emotion and experience the text. There is an unexpected similarity between the lyrics and my day. I decide to pin it to my Facebook wall. A few hours later, I make a chickpea salad and go down to look for my mom and her best friend and invite them to taste it. That night, someone knocks at my door. It's a friend I know from way back. We haven't been in touch for years. Smiling and a bit drunk, he's here to make up for lost time, he says, before I leave for good. We drink a lot of beer and brandy. I exchange a few words, but mainly let him talk. He loves to hear himself speak. Intoxication disposes me to listen. He leaves, staggering, shortly before daybreak. A few moments earlier, I looked at my computer and discovered the Nice terror attack. I don't think I'm likely to know anyone who attended Bastille Day celebrations, much less on the Riviera. And I lay down, knocked out, in my cups. I wake up, stiff all over. I refuse to see the images served up on the news sites. In a flash, I visualize the dubious cash-in, the absurd associations, the manipulation of emotions, the pain, the bodies, the hemoglobin, the tears, the anger they'll dish up in the days to come. The portraits on which the French flag will be juxtaposed. The mourning that unites a torn country. All bloody. All together. The victims' biographies accompanied by a smiling portrait, kindness, innocence shot down in mid-air. Manufacturing martyrs. It's her, it's him, it's you, it's me. The shameless exploitation of the affliction to constrain ever more, to curtail individual liberties. The shift of responsibility, the barometer of growing fear, how many points it can earn in polls, the gravediggers' opportunism, the official thinkers' analysis, always quick to be in the media, horror pornography, reason tweeting, the trolls' poison, hunger for scapegoats, the scent of vengeance, the underlying racism, justifying massive resources, conditioning on order and defense, incompetent reasoning. Fear, a great hunter and unsurpassed unifier. For whom are the snakes that hiss on your heads? I close my eyes, plug my ears, press my temples. But I still hear more and more clearly the sound of boots returning. Am I the only one to hear it? What effects will our inconsistencies have on the next elections? Will great monsters follow the little monsters that have succeeded one another for decades? In this mess, even more than usual, I don't know how to deal with the inconsistency in my derisory life. My procrastinations, anxieties, doubts, the aesthetic entrenchments, the ridiculous habits behind which I erect an illusory wall against the violence of the world: all this seems so selfish, so vain. July continues, relentlessly unrolling a web of extreme abominations and aberrations. The Turkish purges, Adama Traoré, the Labor Law forced through, the evacuation of asylum seekers, and in less than a week, Munich, Kabul, and St Etienne du Rouvray. The sun shines, victims rain down, bombs explode, they exploit the confusion, stupefaction, and the torpor of vacation to impose their new liberal order, trample on the workers, clean the streets of the unsightly camps. Clean up. Demonstrate strength. Reassure. Clear up. Edicts and decrees. Handcuffs and batons. Tasers and grenade launchers. Sickening. The rise of the familiar feelings of bad conscience and guilt of being an impotent spectator of this flood, an anonymous larva protected by my white skin. "I See a Darkness", Bonnie Prince Billy's lament, haunts me. It pierces me, caresses me, consoles me, saddens me. It goes away, I get closer, run from it, it runs back, turns into a handkerchief, a shroud, an amulet, a cloud, a storm, a companion in misfortune. I cling to the concrete, to the endless emptying of the apartment. Keep busy, work, you'll think less. It's no mean feat! If only I accepted diversion, but I can't. My libido triumphs as sleeping beauty, snoring paralytic. My desires are cryogenized. So, when I'm done for the day unhanging, packing, taking down shelves, I return to my fake celluloid brothers, films. A repetition of identical days, the only variant of which is the cinephile menu. Identical nights where the death-blow is brought by cannabis and hops. Monday is the same as Tuesday. Thursday is a photocopy of Wednesday. Corridors of days and weeks that form a labyrinth of dark mirrors. I almost forget, behind the shutters, that it is summer. Faithful friends remind me. Several come from Nantes, Strasbourg, Paris to make a last tour in the woods, to spend some time out of the city. Drunken discussions, debates, bullshit. We warm hearts and minds, refresh throats, share our concerns, dissect our terrors, pretend to reassure ourselves and forget a while. To each their singularities. Some try transvestism, some are obsessed with protection from Lyme disease, some strive to write a western, some Lacan, Hannah Arendt or San Antonio, firefighter or arsonist, some prescribe or swallow, bourgeois or bohemian. All losers! On our walks, we talk about the erosion of our certainties, regret the loss of the values we were formed by. Out of the race, not in the rat race. We examine the world and find some pride in being anomalies, however atomized and derisory. On a path, deer freeze for a moment before disappearing as quickly as they came, or butterflies drinking from thistles in the light of sunset remind us of the possibility of uncorrupted beauty. Just saved by a postcard cliché, by an impromptu prettiness, consensual, unanimous, and devoid of cynicism. For the first time since I came here, I sometimes get lost on these walks with friends, lose my inner compass, forget the path as soon as I've walked it, misinterpret and confuse the landmarks, climb instead of descend, think north and walk south. I lose my way in the greenery of the Vosges. But you always find, almost with regret, the right road, the overflowing fridge, the comfort of second-hand sofas. The lair where you collapse, too tired to think. You fall silent and digest lazily. Night has deigned to fall. The bells ring and ring. Tomorrow, the friends will leave, taking furniture or pottery or a stack of records or books. Thanks for helping me clear out. I'm not done yet. And I always ask the same question: Why don't we watch a movie? 2 more months to go. I stamp my feet inside myself. The days spent alone stretch and slide in slow motion. I've ended this chapter of my life and want to move on to the next one. Pick the new windmills I'll have to fight. But the heart of August only beats weakly. Vacation palpitations that taunt my terrible impatience to leave this daily life steeped in repetition and self-sufficient conditioning. Friends likely to support me benefit here and there from the August break. The world is motionless, petrified in the seasonal heat. Neutral. Calendar suspension. My mother and stepfather have gone for 10 days. I flutter in my jar alone, like an insect held on its back by its heavy shell and whose legs desperately whip the air. The spare time leaves me free to go over each of the obstacles at will and in detail, to foresee obsessively every possible problem. It amplifies annoyances, hammers home doubts, mocks my vulnerability. The anxiety attacks I could drive away are coming back. Without warning, it just happens. I eat, watch a film or sort records. Suddenly, like a dam yielding under too much pressure, a flood of confused, contradictory thoughts, wells up, mercilessly innervating all my brain. Reflexive arrows attack my reason. I'm colonized by waves of fear, on a roller coaster, teleported in the corridor of Alphaville. At every door, emptiness sucks me in. Traveling shot on my besieged conscience that exhorts clemency in vain and gives up. Ideas become confused and blurred, thickened and obscured. Unrelated images clash. My heart pounds, but I'm alone. It's a synapse strike, a tsunami on my neurons. My breathing races. The air is running out. They try to asphyxiate me up in the maelstrom. My pulse pounds madly. I want to scream, no sound comes out. My throat is knotted, my diaphragm in spasm, my temples wet, sweat irritates my forehead, glue forms under my arms. Where are my chemical crutches? Quick, the green and blue tube. The pill under my tongue. I let the bland, floury savior melt, lean out the window, I catch air, trying to regulate my breathing. It's too soon. My head is still racing anarchically. I try to speed up the effects, exhaust my body, the internal trepidation. I run through all the rooms, put my head under water, retrace my steps, spin, sit down, get up, lie down, get up again. True to form, though always late, the remission appears in the distance. In successive waves, with increasing abrasive power, as they approach. The chaos dissipates, the hubbub fades, the crazy pulsations slow down. Soothing waves spread, slowly neutralizing and overcoming the enemy. It's a temporary armistice, a fragile neuronal peace. But it doesn't last long, these episodes multiply, destabilizing and random. Though I overcome them, their frequency and intensity frighten me. I feel diminished by the use of medication, humiliated not to be able to restore a rational course by willpower. Another defeat I must accept. The sum of my failures, I realize, makes me an unstable, unfinished adult, as much as, if not more than the few illusory personal successes I clung to. Sometimes unexpected consolation comes from nature. A singular light that saturates the exterior colors, covering the foliage frozen in the sun. Like an urgent call to roam. Some days, when despite my turbulent impatience, my mind instinctively agrees with the countryside I gaze upon. I go out and take a path whose every rock I know and I rediscover the scenery magnified by fresh shadows: a backlit moribund oak, the river, usually grey and insignificant, shining with adamantine reflections. The landscape which I was sure I'd exhausted all the chromatic variations contradicts my disillusioned character. The eye opens, palpitates, seeks, finds, the spirit is released, flattens, the residual mists of anguish disperse, the horizon, in this accidental epiphany, appears. The forest, those days, is vibrant, contagious promises. The future, when you escape from the enchanting present, exists as inexhaustible possibilities. It'd take almost nothing for me to be permeable to happiness, disposed to serenity, invited to the voyage. It passes, it's over. The escape is escaping, the charm is broken. The bells of apprehension and discouragement toll as soon as I'm indoors. The boy with whom I lived here for 5 years contacts me after a series of unanswered emails. He says he can now take the cat which belonged to him. This means I don't have to find it a new home in a hurry. I invite him to recover the rest of his things, which he'd only taken a tiny part of when we broke up. I go through the apartment and set aside anything that was his or he might have been keen on. I expect him to come with his mother, but he introduces me to his new friend. The young redhead wears a hat and uses the "vous" to me, which gets on my nerves. He must know we used the "vous" form. Luckily, their visit is quick. We exchange banalities. The car is loaded, the cat put in its travel cage. I must admit I don't feel much, apart from relief at being rid of lots of bags and boxes. When saying goodbye, my former lover, I'm about to kiss, asks me to hug him for a moment. I do so, uneasily. This clumsy embrace momentarily revives the languor we felt at the end. It's fueled by the recognition of the journey we made together and by the shared conviction of having made the right choice in splitting up. I walk him back to the car, thinking I'll never see him again. All I feel is superficial sadness at the failure of the relationship, not the separation. That page is turned for good. For a few days, I miss the cat for its warmth, but it makes the departure for Paris more concrete. A level passed. A week later, I hardly think about it. Like every year, the bland chestnut trees in front of the house turn yellow first and lose their leaves in late August, announcing the return to school. The villagers end their vacations, spent in places where their habits aren't questioned and they don't feel foreign. They pick the Black Forest or Austria, the convenience of the language, places where they think the same and above all, where they eat the same: copiously and without fusss. The scenery barely changes, they shift their habits. They look for what most resembles their familiar environment. They mustn't be confused or surprised. They mustn't be inconvenienced by difference or have to adapt. This certainty, among many here, that nothing beats Alsace. Blind passion. Irrational love of the land, of tradition. Pride in their origins, dialectal, historical singularity. Stupidity. While this paunchy procession crawled down Bavarian or Tyrolean paths, waiting for cocktail hour, the US army bombed Libya, a Turkish teen set off a bomb in a church, massacring over 50 people, the earth shook and killed in central Italy, the Calais "jungle" is overflowing, a teacher set fire to himself in a school in Normandy. All's well, all's very well. My depression is quenched by the torrents of atrocities that pour out, day after day. Who could reason with it? Who could calm me, dare to recommend detachment, counter despondency, despair, disgust, stifle my screams of impotence, the guilt of inaction, being a distant witness who doesn't act, but merely retreats into passive silence? The films, of course: outlet, escape, recovery. Film is analgesic, derivative, expiatory, reconciling. Films as bandages, respite, hospices, clinics, brothels, charity, retirement. Films as miracles, oases, semaphores. Films as reflections, observations, slaps, electric shocks, driving belts, braces, armor, races against time, madness, oblivion. Knick-nack. Paddy whack. Tick tock. Only 3 weeks before I go. A countdown in my head and my schedule. My rhythm is finally disrupted. In Paris, my pals are back. A friend lends me her truck, 2 others will drive it here. I decide to continue the online sales till Sept 15. The next day, a man will come for the rest of the stock in the attic. 10,000 records for him, one less worry for me. With my mother, stepfather, and a guy I hired, the process speeds up. The furniture and trinkets I'm not keeping go to the dump, the clothes are sorted, the shelves are emptied, unscrewed, the walls stripped. This dismantling, this return to the place's original nudity pleases me. The departure is no longer a fantasy, the certainty of being soon elsewhere and the implicit possibilities stimulate me. I'm not just observing this adventure. I'm experiencing it, feeling I'm becoming lighter with each object that goes. I pack, with the foretaste of the satisfaction I'll feel when I unpack the same objects 500 kms from here. When I walk in a room, my steps echo. This echo, released by the disappearance of the furniture; this echo, more distinct every day, becomes strangely familiar, an invisible, fortifying partner. An old friend sends a photo of me, taken over 20 years ago in his stairwell in Paris. I vaguely recognize this young man, with full cheeks and a broad smile, still a little pink, affable and carefree. I remember his certainties and satisfaction at leaving the grey military province he came from, his greed for encounters, discoveries, and pleasures. Dark but shiny eyes that betray a fake confidence and a hint of malice. I have a strange feeling about this old photo. No nostalgia but rather surprise. I'd forgotten myself a bit, I have no photos of the last 30 years. I'd hidden the memory of a thirst for life, now dissipated. 3 days later, this friend has a heart attack while cutting vegetables in his kitchen. I think it's a bad joke. But no. Luckily, he's saved in time. I lived for a long time free from mourning anyone close. With the passage of time, advancing age, and my father's death, I now feel that death and sickness now prowl, forcing me to become familiar with them, to admit the vulnerability of others and myself. Leaving. Seeing others leave. Telling myself that adulthood is also learning to deal with the inevitable. A UN publication reveals that 2016 is already the deadliest year for refugees embarking on the Mediterranean. Should this also be accepted as inevitable? Know and do nothing. Look down, grieve, despair, feel the shame my peers inspire, and still do nothing. Accept indifference. Sad experience of humanity that is only human in name. Resignation gives off the disgusting whiff of infamy. I listen again to Aragon's "Is This How Men Live?" performed by Catherine Sauvage: "The sky was grey with clouds Wild geese cried death as they passed Over the houses on the quay I saw them through the window Their sad song entered my being" It's time for the last times, far more exciting than the first: last washday, last boxes, last time seeing my few local friends, last walk in the forest, last family dinners, last films seen here, last nights, last identical days. The apprehension of leaving my addictive loneliness has gone. The need to move forward has taken over. Something inside me still wants to live. Adventitious energy, something maybe stronger than despair and darkness. The fight isn't won, but I'm pursuing it. My mother, who patiently supported me and encouraged me to leave, tries to hide the pain she feels to see me leave. The memory of my improbable move to the area 7 years before has faded. By dint of invisibility and entrenchment, I blended into the landscape. You could almost have forgotten I was an outsider searching for calm, with only an emotional attachment to this dense forest I loved to roam. She'd become quietly accustomed to my proximity, to the possibility of sharing her anger, her exasperation at such hopeless conservatism, the swaggering stupidity that often surrounds her here. I feel a twinge of sorrow at letting her engage in resistance we both know is bound to fail. This sadness is offset by my friends' arrival from far away, to help with the move, load the truck, and drive it to Paris. 10 of us work for a whole day in a joyful atmosphere, transforming the expected ordeal into a fun, amusing time. This last Sunday ends with a meal full of excitement and sweet melancholy. The conversations are warm, the jokes fly, everyone is cheerful, reassuring, kind, benevolent. I'll take with me this last image of the village, lifelong friends without whose support and loyalty I could have given up for good, given up any future perspective, and get bogged down. On the morning of Monday Oct 3, the sky is grey but not threatening, the light is dull. I hug and thank my mother and stepfather, I swallow a few tears and sit by my friends who'll be driving. The engine starts, hands wave at the door and in the rear-view mirror. We take a small road under trees whose foliage isn't completely yellow yet. My mother, the sandstone rocks, the village gradually move away, become silhouettes, dark, undefined nodules, before disappearing completely. I don't really know what lies in store for me. But I'm leaving. Subtitles: J. Miller, a.s.i.f.
