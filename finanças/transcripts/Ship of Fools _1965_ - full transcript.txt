My name is Karl Glocken, and this is a ship of fools. I'm a fool. And you'll meet more fools as we go along. This tub is packed with them. Emancipated ladies, ballplayers, lovers, dog lovers, ladies of joy, tolerant Jews, Dwarfs, all kinds. And who knows, if you look closely enough you may even find yourself on board. Good morning, doctor. Good morning. Glad to get out of Veracruz. The whole damn country is ready to explode. Well, did you get a look at them? Anything interesting? Anything interesting at all? There's a dwarf, that high. A couple of young American painters. And a Jewish salesman with an infectious sense of humor. Women, Willie. Women. Well, a rather attractive middle-aged American woman. But I'm afraid she's too far from the cradle for you. Those are the kind that can appreciate what they are getting. There's a Spanish dancing troupe, interesting, but maybe professional. They've had those Spanish dance troupes on board before. And the usual assortment of our countrywomen. Professors' wives? Saleswomen putting on airs? I'm afraid so. Governesses? Maybe you shouldn't. That's all right. You're really getting off at Bremerhaven, huh? It wasn't a very long career. Three voyages. Long enough. I don't know what I'm going to do without you. You'll manage. You want to know the sentimental, disgusting truth? I've become fonder of you than of most people in my life. We just got used to each other, that's all. Who am I to play chess with? Who am I to talk to? You've seen the kind of characters we get on this ship. I get a cold shudder every time I have to go to the captain's table. I must be in my dotage. After my... I was looking for something. I thought I could learn something new by being a ship's doctor. But I've seen all this before. I've seen all these people before. Never on a ship, that's all. Come in. Lunch is served, captain. Thank you. Please? What should I tell them this time? Tell them anything you like. Tell them I had to fix the toilets. 1933 will be a good year. I am optimistic. At any rate, it is starting out most auspiciously. It is good to be on a German boat with German people, going home. Say what you will, there is a feeling when German people get together. I cannot explain it. Gemntliche Kameraderie which exists among no other people. At least I have found it nowhere else. You know what they say in Mexico? Mexicans loathe the Americans, hate the Spaniards, distrust the English, admire the French and love the Germans. That is very nice. I am glad they say those things. But as far as I am concerned, after a few weeks in Mexico you can keep the Mexicans too. How long has it been since you have been home, Herr Freytag? Four months. You must be glad to be going home too. Yes, my wife is there. Why is it every charming man I meet is married? Fraulein Spockenkieker, you have wounded to me the quick. Excepting you, Herr Rieber. I'm sorry. That little dog is so sweet. He has shared so much of the professor's life and mine I feel sometimes he is like our son. Do you think it's correct to bring a dog to the table? Bebe goes with us everywhere. We have taken him to some of the best restaurants. Nobody seems to mind. You know, it's gonna be a wonderful trip, David. I still feel funny about you picking up the tab. Look, we weren't gonna talk about that. Did I ever tell you these have been the best 3 months of my life? Did I ever tell you that I care for you so much it's very upsetting? What? What's the matter? Twenty six days in separate beds. It's probably a very good thing. We'll get to know each other. We'll find out whether we have anything going for us besides sex. I'll give you one more time to hang yourself. I know you got more money from the Swede. Gave you what I got. Barman told me different. He is a liar. If you're holding out, I'll rip your lying tongue out. Rip my guts out. I don't have any more money. - Que pasa? - Que pasa? I asked for a table alone. I'm sorry, madame, there is no room for a table alone. Please don't bother getting up. You're an American? My name's Bill Tenny. Mary Treadwell. Yes, madam? I'll have the Pate and the Rheinischer Sauerbraten. You, sir? You got a steak? Yes, sir. Thick? We will do our best. I'd better stick to the simple stuff. I was in Veracruz trying to teach them greasers to play ball. Man, they tried to poison me. You know, I had the runs for three weeks. How interesting. I'd like to hear more about it. Herr Rieber, I hear that you publish a national magazine with certain intellectual features. A garment trade magazine, but modern. Modern. Good afternoon. I'm Willie Schumann, the ship's doctor. The captain sends his regrets. He's unable to come to lunch because of ship's business. Doctor, I am Siegfried Rieber. This is Professor Hutten, Frau Hutten. Please. No, no allow me. Their dog, Bebe. This charming young lady is Fraulein Spockenkieker. Herr Freytag, Frau Schmitt, Herr Graf and his nephew Johann. Don't let me interrupt your conversations. We were just discussing Herr Rieber's magazine. I have invited writers from all over the nation to How we can expunge foreign influences and restore Germany to its national greatness. What foreign influences? If you need any attendance, I'll be at your disposal. Thank you. On my part, doctor, you need have no concern for me. I do not believe in materia medica. Really? Have you found something better to replace it? Faith. Faith. I see. Well, well. A toast. A toast to the German woman, the most beautiful in the world. Delicious. Herr Rieber. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Karl Glocken. Julius Lowenthal. The herring is very good. I'll have that and a couple of hard-boiled eggs. I beg your pardon. You aren't Jewish, are you? No, I have my own minority group. They usually give a Jew a table of his own on a boat like this. Why do you think they put us together? It's their way of being friendly. Perhaps they thought we might hit it off. You are sure you are not Jewish? Reasonably sure. You resemble a brother-in-law of mine in Stuttgart. That's the way it is. People are always mistaking me for someone else. Spot of wine? Just a touch. My God, where are we going to put them? We'll have to manage. Professor, what is it? What's happening? Who are all those people? There's nothing to be concerned about. I have spoken to one of the officials. But what is it? It has to do with the price of sugar on the world market. Sugar? Yeah. You see, the sugar planters have been unable to get their price so they burned their crops in the fields rather than let the prices go down. Something had to be done about the Spanish laborers so the Cuban government hit upon a humanitarian plan of action. They're sending them home. - How do you feel? - Bien. Good. I come to see you later, yes? Please put her there in the corner. Where can they wash? There are two spigots. What?! It is not my fault. Stop talking to me in this way. You don't put 600 people on a deck with only two outlets to wash! They wouldn't wash if they could. You don't know what pigs they are. The deck has to be cleaned. Bring the hoses. The hoses? Bring the hoses out! I cannot turn hoses on them. It's better to turn the hoses on them than for them to live this way, no? Break out the hoses. Turn on those hoses. I take it you are not exactly pleased that we are cabin mates on this voyage. I have already requested a change in the accommodations. Take it from me, I'm not exactly overwhelmed with the prospect either. However, pending changes since we are captives of each other's company for 26 days, I think it is best if we reach an understanding. Our cosmetics, for instance. I will keep mine on this side of the sink. And you keep yours on that side. That's right? Which bunk do you prefer, the lower or the upper? I was assured the lower. It is yours. What are your habits? I, myself, rise very early in the morning. I take it that if this evening is an example, you are a late bird. If you sleep late, I will see that I do not disturb you. And I hope you, in turn, will try your best not to disturb me. One other thing. One other thing. My wife has informed me in the most sarcastic terms possible I snore. Good night. You a painter, huh? Yeah. What was you doing in Mexico? I was a timekeeper in a mine. I thought you said you was a painter. I am a painter, but I was a timekeeper. Why? To support myself as a painter. Don't you make any money painting? No. Now, wait a minute. Come on. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me you work at something you can't make a living off so you gotta take a job to make enough money to go on working at work you can't live on? But that is the heroic life. That is the way men who trust themselves can afford to live. A strange neck of the woods. What do you mean? Strange neck of the woods. Look, I run into all kinds of people, you know, but. Did I tell you what happened in Veracruz coming through immigration? I'm standing in line. I see this clerk and I holler, "Hey, Pancho! Get over here!" Just being friendly-like like back home you call a taxi driver Mac or a Pullman porter George. This little Negro... now, you know these coast Mexicans got mostly Negro blood in 'em, I'm told. Well, he just looks up and stares at me. The next thing I know, everybody's going ahead of me in this line. Then I realize that this little Negro resented it. I think I'll turn in. Me too. Come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. I'm the doctor. You wanted to see me? Yes. I need something to help me sleep. Are you ill? No, no. I just want something to help me sleep. Do you often have trouble sleeping? Yes. Always. Does your doctor help you to sleep? Yes. Occasionally. Take off your robe. You're sure you're the ship's doctor? I am the ship's doctor. Lean forward, please. What is it? Your hands are cold. I'm sorry. Breathe deeply. When was your period? - Look, is it necessary to... - Yes, it is necessary. All right. Last week. I'm sure you'd never have any trouble sleeping. No, never. Tell me your secret. A clear conscience, of course. That's a neat trick, having a clear conscience when you're a doctor on a ship which has 600 people living on an open deck. You can't take pills every time you can't sleep or anytime you want to be stimulated or sedated. It has its effect. What are you laughing at? My house has been burned. They've taken everything I had. Now I'm being taken to prison, to an island I know nothing about. And you're giving me a Sunday school sermon. You can put your robe back on now. Thank you. You're a gentle touch. Maybe you're not as stuffy as you pretend to be. No. I hope not. You gonna help me? Your doctor may have helped you too often. I'm very helpless at this moment. You can leave me without any help. That's your prerogative. This is for tonight only. How old are you? I'm old enough, as you can see. Much too old. Forty five? Not that old. How old are you? Forty two. How old are you? Forty one. You're joking. Thank you. Lie back, please. You will feel it in a moment. Yes. Talk. I beg your pardon? Talk until the drug takes effect. This boat smells of cabbage. Why does every German boat smell of cabbage? Keep talking. What do you want me to talk about? Anything you like, just talk. What's your name? Schumann. No, your first name. Wilhelm. Wilhelm. Wilhelm. It's perfect. Perfect. Have you made this trip before? I make it at least twice a year. Are you in some sort of business? I'm in the jewelry business. A special part. I sell religious trinkets. Any religion. You name it, I got it. I sell neck chains, bracelets, anklets. It sounds like good business. It's a very good business. People feel better when they wear these things. I feel good too. With all this stuff on me, I feel like an African I met in Paris. He bought from me a crucifix, Buddha and mezuzah. All on one chain. Do you know what he said? He said, It may not help, but it can't hurt. You seem to get along very well with people. I like people. If you look for it, you can find something good in anybody. It must be difficult sometimes. For instance, doesn't it bother you that you and that little man are the only two Germans who aren't at the captain's table? Do you think that bothers me? Besides, I like that little man. What kind of a salesman do you think I would be if I couldn't deal with a situation like that? A salesman is supposed to deal with a difficult situation and overcome it. Listen, it's not a new story. White men hate black men. Muslims hate Buddhists. That's the way it goes. There's prejudice everywhere. It does no good to give it back. You have got to use your noodle. You must not mind not winning against me. After all, I was Ping-Pong champion of the Sportsverein in Frankfurt, three times over. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. Herr Freytag picks some bizarre company. I suspect they are birds of a feather. Well, shall we play again? Or perhaps I might suggest another game. What game? Any game. One which you might win. What game do you mean? You have no idea'? I will not let you talk that way to me. I'm sorry. How dare you! I could not resist. I couldn't resist either. What do your parents feel about you going to Europe? Mother's thrilled. It's something she's always wanted to do. I think my father gave me up for lost a long time ago. What do your parents do? My father owns a store. It's a good store, a furniture store. My mother's never been satisfied with it. She taught me that a woman had to have something outside of her husband, otherwise it was bridge games and one day a week at the hospital. What about that young man you're traveling with? David. David's an artist. A wonderful one. He's a bit caught up with social consciousness right now but he'll get over that. Is it serious? I never felt about anybody the way I do about David. I think that David thinks a woman should follow three paces behind with slippers. Men usually do. My husband certainly did. No, thank you. I have a whiskey sour. What did your husband do? He was in the diplomatic corps. We put up a wonderful front in public. We were everybody's favorite couple. In private, it was something else again. He was jealous of me. He was so jealous of me that he hit me. He hit me until I bled at the nose. I was wondering whether David would beat me. We quarrel sometimes. It seems to come out of nothing then it grows into such ugliness and bitterness. It surprises both of us. I guess a relationship between a man and a woman is very difficult these days. Practically impossible. Put on your beret, Carlos. Now we can hang in The Prado. We will hang somewhere, Carlos. The place is uncertain. That's enough for today, thank you. Anytime. I just can't tell you how much I admire you. Why? You create. I'm not even sure about that. I've never been given a penny for any of this. Still, I envy you. I envy you your struggle. I envy you your doubts and flounderings, even. And Fraulein Brown. I envy you that too. She's an attractive girl, isn't she? Are you two going to be married? I am sorry. I don't mean to pry. You know, the distasteful curiosity of the non-participant. That's all right. I don't honestly know whether we'll get married. I told you how uncertain my life is. I need all the help I can get. I need someone who can believe in a man who hasn't proved himself yet. Someone to be there. Be for me. Couldn't Fraulein Brown be that? Fraulein Brown is a modern woman. Their needs are a lot more complicated than our mothers' were. I'm crazy about Jenny. I really am. I never felt this way about anybody, the way I feel about her. I'm afraid to find out how apart we really might be. I see. I suppose one of the saddest things in the world must be to see two people who feel so much for each other and who feel that they belong together, and yet they really don't belong together at all. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing? I'm making one of these. How many of these do you have? Many.- Here is a bull. A dog. Do you think anyone in first class would be interested to buy them? I would. Good morning. Good morning. How long have you been here? About a half an hour. No, no, don't get up. Lie back. Did you put this over me? Of course. I'm glad to see you are on deck. It was a wonderful drug you gave me, whatever it was. What was it, incidentally? You don't expect me to tell you, do you? You can actually laugh. Did I startle you very much? It's good to hear you laugh too. Did you ever have all the worst possible things that can happen to you happen? Well, it gives you the most irresponsible feeling. Nothing more can happen. Hey! Are you all right? It takes a great deal of courage to tangle with those two. I have a certain security with them. They are the only characters on the boat smaller than I am. Such a charming lady makes a charming morning even more charming. Thank you. He's wonderful. He certainly is. The one thing about these children they seem to have a better time than anyone on the boat. If you expect me to defend those two monsters, you're much mistaken. My prescription for them is to throw them overboard in a leaky lifeboat. You didn't have a childhood at all? Nothing like theirs. At least, I hope not. When I was 4, I persuaded my little brother to drink lye water. Lye water? Yeah, I told him it was milk. So he went to screaming about the house. His mouth was scrubbed out. I was beaten black and blue. I meant him no harm. I was only curious to know whether it would kill him. And what about your childhood? Did nothing gay ever happen to you at all? No, I was the perfect dupe. I believed anything anybody ever told me. I was full of the highest hopes and the most unbelievable innocence. It's true, at the age of 12, I did have an experience with the housekeeper that left an indelible impression on me shocked my mother no end and cost the poor girl her job. Well, there is hope for you after all. The toreros are having a fiesta tonight. I know. Are you coming? I wasn't planning to. I thought we might have a dance if you did. Of course, you probably don't dance. Exactly how dull do you think I am? You are dull. You're dull, stolid, unimaginative helpless and charming. Yes, charming. You're blushing. That's the most charming thing I've ever seen in my whole life. I've never seen a man blush before. I'm not blushing. I must have a temperature. Anyway, I'll wear my only dress and I'll give you the choice of any dance you like. And I have a feeling it's gonna be a slow waltz. I happen to excel in the flamenco. I was an intellectual. I was a philosopher and teacher of philosophy. Until three years ago, I learned I was going to die. Then my wisdom dropped from me like soiled rags. I was naked as the day I was born. I heard a voice. The most loving voice I've ever heard. The voice of God! And God said to me... God speaks to him. He speaks to him personally. Be quiet, Gregorio! Don't spit on everything. I asked myself, why was I afraid? What are my personal sufferings but a divine grace that can be made useful to others'? The miracle is... Miracle? What miracle? Can you make us a miracle? Can you get us out of this slop, into the upper decks, where we can breathe? That is a miracle. You blasphemous pig! You are the pig. We are all pigs. Look at the way we live! Listen! Listen to me! God's mercy is in... God? There is no God down here! Do you know what I would do if God were here? I would curse him to his face. I would spit in his face! I would send him down into his own hell! Get him out of here! Yeah! The hoses. And give them more than a bath this time. Yes, sir. The hoses! A toast to el capitan. A toast to el capitan! With the hope that this beautiful occasion may serve to bring those two great countries Spain and Germany, closer together. The Spanish heritage, the German empire in all its glory. El capitan! Good God. Looking for someone? What do you mean? Dr. Schumann is a very charming man, isn't he? He's in steerage. People say there are only three reasons why a man would He wants to travel. Or his health is not good. Or he's escaping from the law. Which is it with Dr. Schumann? Dr. Schumann has a quite serious case of heart trouble. Will you excuse me? - What is your name? - My name is Johann. Why were you staring at me, Johann? - How is your father? - He's my uncle. He's sleeping in the cabin. The doctor gave him something to quiet him down. Dance with me. I don't dance. I will show you. Do you feel that? Only Spanish women move like that. It is called the meneo. Feel? I am not a gypsy, you know. I am real Spanish, and this is the sign. You're doing it on purpose. Oh, no. I was born this way. Do you hear what they say? My hip bones. They say, Meneo meneo all by themselves. Will you buy me a bottle of champagne? I can't. Just a small bottle. I don't have anything. Not a pfennig. Excuse me. Shall we sit down? Oh, yes. Of course. Here we are. You're doing your job very well. My job? Isn't it the duty of the ship's personnel to see that unescorted women don't get too unhappy? I am here because I want to be. Now you really are doing very well. Don't you believe me? Does it matter whether I do or not? Perhaps you would prefer to remain alone. Oh, no. No. Please stay and have a drink with me. It's my birthday. Is it really your birthday? Forty six. Me, forty six. I can't believe it, 46. We Europeans are not as conscious of age as you are. When one looks as you do and arouses in people the feeling you do, does it really matter? You're very kind. There's a time when hearts grow cold and hard. Women lose their grace and become shrill. They run to fat or turn to beanpoles. Take to secret drinking. They marry men too young for them and get just what they deserve. It's enough to scare anyone, waiting for fear and loneliness to do their work. Mrs. Treadwell, you are a very exciting woman, and you know it. Tell me, wouldn't it unnerve you to have an affair with me? Good evening. Are you enjoying yourselves? You're not dancing. Captain, do you have a second? Yes. There's a man in steerage. One of your men took his carving knife away. He needs his knife for his work. This is the kind of thing he does. Very nice. Very nice indeed. The man's an artist. He's not gonna do anybody any harm. You are absolutely certain of that? I'm certain. Unfortunately, I have to be answerable not only for your safety but for the safety of the ship. Captain, the man is an artist. He needs his knife for his work. I'm sorry. Enjoy the Part)! I feel sorry for him. You feel sorry for him? He's a nice man. He doesn't like doing this. But he's doing it. That's the point, isn't it? David, you're gonna hate me for this but I'm glad those people in steerage don't have knives. Afraid they'll come up over the sides and murder us in our nice, clean, white beds? Maybe they should. You're so unattractive when you get like this. So violent and myopic. It's exactly the kind of thing that infects your work. What about my work? I told you no one would dance with me. Elsa, dance with your father. Mama, please. Dance with your father. Elsa, when you go to a dance, you first dance with your escort. Now, I am your escort, so you will first dance with me. Then, when you're seen dancing, someone else will invite you. Besides, you haven't danced with your papa since your last birthday. Papa, please. I don't want to dance. I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was here. Don't be ashamed. What's the matter? Come here. Sit down. Sit down. Come here. Tears are good. You know what they say in Turkey? They say tears wash the eyes and one can see better. At least I think they say it in Turkey. Turkey. Now tell us, what is the reason for this great emotional outburst? Why isn't a charming young lady like you inside enjoying the music and dancing? Because no one wants to dance with me. And I'm not charming. You are telling me you are not charming? An expert who has been to Istanbul, Hamburg and Paris? You are telling me? I am telling you that anybody with eyes in his head can see that you are charming. Ask anybody with any intelligence. Ask Glocken. Is this young lady charming or isn't she? Charming. There. I told you. And how old are you? Sixteen. Adolescence. What is adolescence? Adolescence is a time when people worry about things there's no need to worry about. Sixteen. I promise you, at 17, you will be even more charming than you are now. At 21, you will be gorgeous. And at 25, devastating. And I won't stand any arguments. Tales from the Vienna Woods. David, Tales from the Vienna Woods. Dance with me. You never like to dance. I think I've been happiest when I was dancing. Sometimes I wish that I'd tied a tape measure to my ankle when I danced all my life. Then I could tell you how many miles I've traveled when I was happiest. David, dance with me. Well. I'm gonna enjoy this party in spite of you, David so if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna dance with the first man who asks me. And here he comes. May I have this dance? Delighted. Good evening. Good evening. You seem in good spirits. I am. I delivered a baby tonight. How wonderful. What was it, a boy or a girl? Boy. What about our celebration? What do you mean? Our dance. You intimidated me. I really don't dance. I thought so. Well, this is a waltz, and even you can manage a waltz. I doubt it. I don't. Just follow me and then follow the music. How do you feel? I can't seem to get over this cold. But I guess I'll be better if I can get another night's sleep. You have to help me again. It's not helping you. Oh, Willie. Don't lecture me. You'll lose count. I'm trying to tell you how serious it is. Why are you trying to tell me? Are you trying to tell me I'm an addict? Okay, so I bought you a bottle of champagne, right? Right. And I know my way around, right? Right. So when we gonna get together? We are together now. Come on, baby. You know what I mean. You mean you want to sleep with me. First money. How much money? How much? Forty dollars. You're out of your mind. As a publisher, my aim is to direct readers to the vital issues of our society. I have lately got a doctor to begin a series of articles advocating the extermination of all the unfit at birth. That's the way it's with Herr Rieber. He's thinking all the time. All this will be accomplished painlessly, of course. Painlessly. Not only defective or useless children, but the old too. Old persons over 60 or 65, perhaps. The same measures will be taken with Jews, of course and any illegitimate mixtures of race. White with colored of any kind, Chinese, Negroes and for any white man convicted of a serious crime well, as for him. There is only one problem with all this. Who will be left? That is the difficulty. No one is ever willing to accept a new idea. Shall we dance? I like to listen to Herr Rieber. Every time I listen to him, I feel reassured. I know no one could ever take him or his party seriously. Pardon me. May I? How do you feel? Try a little longer. I promise to help you when the time comes. I want to sit down. It's a nice party. Are you enjoying it? Can I have a cigarette, please? May I get you something? Thank you. Excuse me, please. I feel like I'm gonna die. I know. What's wrong with you? You are selfish, boorish... Don't know why I can't get you out of my system. You're not even pretty. Your head is filled with such garbage! I wish I could empty it. Take your hands off me! David, stop it. I'll call for the purser. Leave me alone. Jenny, Jenny. What? What do you want from me? What? I wish I knew. Oh, Jenny. Jenny, what's the matter? I'm crying. That's what's the matter, I'm crying. The sweetest face. The sweetest face in the world. David. David, what's gonna happen to us? You never were any good at that. It has a zipper, remember? What a wonderful sky. I'm sure you and your wife watch clouds together. I wish there was someone to watch clouds with me. You're an extremely romantic woman, Mrs. Treadwell, aren't you? It's been the handicap of my life. I can't settle for things. Bernard Shaw said it, didn't he? If you can't get what you want, you better damn well settle for what you can get. What did you want, Mrs. Treadwell? A useful life. Someone to love me. Forever. Ridiculous of me, wasn't it? And what happened? I chose the wrong man. How many times have you heard that said, I wonder. He was the most promising. The most handsome. He had the most glorious facade. The facade was all there was. He made me the best-known wife of the best-known skirt-chaser in the community. I made life hell for him. It ended in the divorce courts. We met one day in the corridor outside the courtroom. He struck me. I took every penny he had. So you must forgive me if I'm not exactly receptive to the idea of other people's happiness in marriage. I'm envious. You and your wife probably have the closest thing to a perfect life one can get. Nothing is perfect, Mrs. Treadwell. I just wanted to tell you that I would have bought the champagne. I would have bought it if I had the money. Come in. How old are you? Nineteen. You're one year older than I am. Can you give me something? I'm not asking for much, but I must have something. Pepe would beat me within an inch of my life if I don't give him something. But aren't you a dancer? You better go. Good. More dollars. Let's see, there was the student and the sailor. What about him? He did not have anything. What was he doing here? He wanted to see me. Did it ever occur to you that someone might just want to see me? That I might want to be with someone my own age? I am a human being, too, whether you think so or not. Who told you? Who told you you were a human being? If it were up to you, I'd spend the whole voyage on my back. What you are is something I picked up on the street at 14 with dirty underpants. Trying to stop men for a few centavitos for you and your dirty family. Lowenthal! You're snoring! That's what my wife says. Why are they doing this to you? I lived with a man who controlled the lives of 5,000 people. I mean controlled. I didn't want to, but I became entangled with those people's lives. I came to know that every piece of food I ate, every piece of clothing I had was coming out of their lives. One day, I entered one of their houses. I'll never forget it. The woman who lived there saw the shock in my eyes at the way they lived. And she said, "Pardon me." I said, "Pardon you for what?" So she said, "Pardon me for my house, pardon me for the way it looks, pardon me for everything." And then she said, "But of course, you must understand "that most of this place is a garbage dump, and I'm just a piece of garbage." I began by hiding agitators in the chapel of the house and I ended by helping them get arms. You don't say anything. I don't know what to say. I haven't met many people in my life who have committed themselves to anything. You never talk about yourself. There's not very much to tell. I came from a Hamburg worker's family. I worked hard to become a doctor. I tried to be a man, I got this. It is formidable. It's idiotic. Marked for life like cattle. - Are you married? - Mm-hmm. Children? Two sons. Are you happy? Who is happy? Why isn't she here with you now? There was no reason in dragging her halfway across the world with me. What about you? Are you married? Three times. What happened? Never found the right one. Maybe I was waiting for someone like you, someone I could teach the waltz. I'm sure. Just think. Isn't it wonderful? Two strangers on a ship. We will never meet again. And we can talk. We can talk like friends. Or even lovers. We can talk like two people who meet on the other side of the grave. Keep talking. Do you have any feeling for me? No, of course not. Of course not. It's funny. You know what I thought you might be? I thought you might be the innocent, romantic love I should have had in my girlhood. Of course, nobody ever loved me innocently. And how I would have laughed at him if he had. I never could hit a curve ball on the outside corner. I beg your pardon? I never could hit a curve ball on the outside corner. That's very interesting. What does it mean? You wouldn't know if I told you. All right, I'll tell you. You're at bat, see? At bat. Bat! Bat! Okay, now you're at bat. The pitcher, he's out there. Now he's winding up, and he turns her loose and... Just as it gets to you, it dips down and away. And that is a curve ball on the outside corner. I could never hit that pitch with a paddle. I see. No, you don't see. You don't see at all. You don't know what it's like to be out there crowd's yelling for you to deliver. And they start talking. The pitchers, they talk. He can't hit a curve ball on the outside corner. And from then on out, that's all you see is curve balls on the outside corner. So you've had your big chance. And you have muffed it. I can still hear my old man yelling at me from the stands even though he wasn't there. Big wheel. You are a bum! You are a bum, just like me. I think you're being a bit harsh on yourself, Herr Tenny. A bum. You know, I travel a lot. My folks give me some money. Not much, but some. They are more comfortable when I'm not around. You know what I find? I find the most amusing things about people are their guilts that they drum up for themselves. For instance, I estimate that there must be at least 873 million people in the world who don't even know what a curve ball on the outside corner is. So I think it a bit excessive for you to think that you have muffed your whole life just because you couldn't hit it paddle or no paddle. Do you understand what I mean, Herr Tenny? No. You know what I think? No. I think that you are a sawed-off intellectual. Bottoms up, shorty. The purser, from whom I learn what little I know about this ship has informed me that you were seen leaving La Condesa's cabin at a highly unrespectable hour. No comment, Willie? I think that's one of the reasons I like you. You don't have my vulgarity. I wonder if it's really true that life is as stupid and meaningless as it seems to be on this ship. The Lutzes and their daughter, the Huttens and their dog. And gross little Rieber, who thinks of himself as the wave of the future. I suppose a great case could be made for my own foolishness. Will your wife be there to meet you at Bremerhaven? She's a wonderful woman. We've been polite to each other for a good many years. Well, your sons will be glad to see you. We hardly know each other anymore. What will you do, go back to your practice? I'm the kind of doctor I hate. The hack general practitioner. What would you have liked to have been? A good doctor. Don't you think you are? Fair to middling. What do you think happens to a woman like La Condesa when she's deported under such circumstances? How long are you going to keep me a penniless beggar? Do I have to ask you for change to go to the barber? Remember the agreement, Johann? The agreement. You are to receive everything after my death. Your mother was so pleased for you. She was so pleased for your opportunity. My mother was pleased for a chance for money for herself. How can you keep me a penniless beggar? How can you do that? Don't you have a heart at all? I have a heart. That's why I can do it. What would you do with the money, Johann? I have seen you watch that gypsy dancer's buttocks as she walks on the deck. I will not nourish your lust. - Good morning. - Good morning. I have been trying to persuade Mrs. Treadwell to have some breakfast. There's nothing like it, you know. Especially the morning after. At home, we always used to have it English style: Kidneys, sausages, kippers, things like that. How elegant. Well, I think I'll look in on the bar before dinner. What a hard-trying race they are. English style for breakfast, French style for dinner. And every now and again, a comfortable lapse back to sauerbraten, sauerkraut and beer. He seems very attentive, I'll say that for him. Did you ever see such a collection of bores'? The attentive Lt. Huebner, the happily-married man, Herr Freytag. And here comes the ape. Morning. How's the painting? I haven't been able to do much on board, but here's something I've been doodling with. - You can see I'm in love. - Of course. Everybody on this ship is in love. Love me whether or not I love you. Love me whether I am fit to love. Love me whether I am able to love. Even if there is no such thing as love. Love me. Where've you been? I've been talking to that Mrs. Treadwell. She's so bitter. She frightens me sometimes. Well, what do you think? It's interesting. I think it's good. Well, of course it's good. You couldn't do anything that wouldn't be good. It's wonderful. But? Does it have to be the same thing all the time? Just what do you mean? You know, the exploitation of the masses. Well, it's true, isn't it? Well, it's just that... No matter how well these things are done, they always turn out to be posters after all, don't they? You hate my work, don't you, Jenny? I think it's good. Here he comes. Now, watch. What is it? I told the steward. Just watch. If you will come this way, sir. I'm going to have lunch. Yes. Another table has been arranged for you. Arranged? Who arranged it? Right over here, sir. Now he will see how we feel. Dr. Schumann, they have placed Herr Freytag at another table. Herr Rieber, you are a real anti-Semite. I don't know any Jews. I don't know anything about them at all. I'm not an anti-Semite. How can you say that? I'm very fond of the Arabs. I lived among them for a while and found them to be very good people. You have not said a word, Dr. Schumann. What do you think about? Excuse me. Doctor has heart trouble. Do you suppose we should send to inquire after him? Schumann. Schumann. Is that not a Jewish name? My wife is Jewish. I told that American woman. She must have told them. Come, have some wine. It's Niersteiner Domtal. Why be upset? The company is much better at this table, I can assure you. When Glocken isn't smoking one of his foul-smelling cigars. I don't mind not being seated at the captain's table. Perhaps because I was never invited in the first place. Those pious hypocrites. Why do you take it? I have been taking it for a long time. Oh, yes, he has. He has 2,000 years of suffering behind him. Well, I'm not going to take it. A little patience. A little understanding. The world's getting better all the time. As my Aunt Rebecca used to say... I don't give a damn what your Aunt Rebecca used to say. Do you think any of you are any better Germans than I am? Do you? Yes, yes, I have a Jewish wife. She's Jewish. Let me tell you about her. She'd never hurt anyone in her life. Anyone. You... You good, middling people. You aren't fit to be in the same world as her. I saw some of you in the chapel this morning. You kneel there and pray. You pretend that you are good people. Good people? You can't even exist without your prejudices. And the worst thing about you is that you don't even recognize what you are. You... Sometimes I think, in spite of how much you understand, it's enough already. What's going on? They moved Herr Freytag from the captain's table because his wife is Jewish. And it's my fault. I had to tell that dreadful Brunhilda to stop her from chattering on so. So stupid of me. He's such a nice man. I'd no idea this was going to happen. You're not gonna cry, are you? Of course not. I never cry. What do they got against the Jews? Back home, we don't have anything against the Jews. Hell, I never even saw a Jew 'til I was 15. Maybe you were too busy lynching Negroes to take time out for the Jews. Why don't you ring for the steward? He might give you something. I have been ringing! Ringing! Ringing! Ringing! A fellow gave these pills to me in Tangiers. He had a theory that seasickness has something to do with the eardrums. You know, Lowenthal? Yes? You are really not such a bad fellow. You think so? These statements that I make, you mustn't take them personally. No, of course not. It is the march of history. History is beyond us, Lowenthal. Feel better? A little. Good. The thing I can't understand is why you want to go back to Germany. I would not want to be where I was not wanted. Why don't you go back to your own country? Germany is my country. My father was born in Germany. And my grandfather was born in Germany. As a matter of fact, where are you from? I can't place your accent. You speak German like no one I have ever heard. The last 20 years of my life were spent in Germany. Austria? Near the border. That's what I thought. You know it is a historical fact that the Jews are the basis of our misfortunes. Of course. You agree? Of course. The Jews and the bicycle riders. Bicycle riders? Why the bicycle riders? Why the Jews? Hey, what's going on? Man overboard! Man overboard! Hey, man overboard! Get her out of here! Take her to our cabin, please. Turn him over. Can you understand it? A man jumps from a moving ship at night, in the middle of the ocean. And is drowned to save the life of a dog. Yes, I can understand. Who was he? He was a woodcarver. He carved little animals with his pocketknife. Come in, please. Doctor, what can we do? Well, you're doing all that can be done. How did it happen? Yeah. How did it happen? He was thrown overboard. Who would do such a thing? But look at him. He knows that someone tried to drown him! His heart is broken. Doctor! You are not leaving? Perhaps we could get him some broth. Some hot broth. Yes. You can give him some broth. It won't do any harm. Is that all? Yes, that's all. The man who saved him is dead. Did he say a man is dead? I know how you feel. No. You don't. You're like the others. You thought the captain was justified in taking his knife away. right? You were the one who felt sorry for the captain. That was you, wasn't it? Why can't we be honest with each other? I don't know. Maybe we're afraid to be. Well, let's try. Maybe we'd better try. David. You say I hate your painting. Well, I do. Oh, God help me, but I do. I don't know why. You've said it. Maybe it's because I'm not very good at it myself. Or maybe it's because it means so much to you more than anything, more than even me. That's being honest, isn't it? Yes, that's honest. Well, I'll tell you something that's even more sad. I can't be what you want me to be. And I know you need someone just to be there to deny herself for you. David, I wish I could be like that, but I can't. I just can't. Jenny, I know you can. Well, it means leaving me with nothing. You know? Nothing. Jenny, do you know what I need? I need something very simple. I need a woman. But that's so difficult for you, isn't it? You're so full of competition. Do you know how empty and frustrating it is to reach out for something and then you find it isn't there? To feel that someone is with you. David, don't you think that I am? Don't you think that I am in spite of myself? Haven't I tried everything? Yes, you have tried. You've split a gut. It's so hard for you. I know. It's so hard for both of us. All right, you say my work is the most important thing in my life. It is. But that's the way I am. I can't help it. And whoever shares my life is going to have to put up with that. She's going to have to live a life for me. Jenny, I know this sounds selfish, but it's true. We're not gonna go on together, are we? Are we? David? Come in. I would have come to you. Well, they said you weren't feeling well. I'm just tired, that's all. Were you sleeping? No. Don't you know it's very unhealthy to sleep with your clothes on? Where are they? What? Where are they? What are you looking for? Stop riﬂing through my things. Here they are. Put them on. Come on. Put them on. And I'll read to you until you sleep. Some pretty risque literature you've got here. Natural Resistance and Clinical Medicine. Researches on Rheumatism. Diseases... I don't know why I'm so tired. Why, yes, of course. Well, that's the way it is sometimes. The woodcarver died. Yes, I know. I have been unable to accept death. Never. No matter how many times I've seen it. I always feel as though I'm responsible. Now, let's see what we've got here. The dissolute Lady Chatterley sat waiting for the gardener to enter. He entered, stopping for a moment, sensing someone in the room. His muscles sinewy in the moonlight. She spoke his name softly. The gardener went over to her. He kissed Lady Chatterley with a kiss such as she had never been given before. Her arms were waiting for him, both resisting and demanding. "Jonathan," she said, "Jonathan, darling, you are violating me." Where did you get that? You're so strange. Sometimes you're so bitter. Then you're soft and warm, like a child. I'm just a woman. Lie back. There's three days to Tenerife. I know. What will your treatment be like for you there? Do you know? Will you be imprisoned? It will be some kind of an imprisonment, I imagine. But you mustn't think of me sleeping on a stone floor and living on bread and water. This is not my style. Now I'm going to read to you from this book exactly the way it's written. If this doesn't put you to sleep, nothing ever will. The liver is a large, glandular organ irregularly shaped and of reddish-brown color. Please come with me to the table. No. I've done enough. You just have to take it from here on by yourself. Are you sure I look all right? You look lovely. Now, go on. Good evening. Good evening. - Hello. - Hello. Waiter, I would like one bottle of champagne, please. - Would you like to join me? - Why not? What are we celebrating? Quarrel? It's over. I'm sorry. Will you excuse me? I have to go to the bridge. Do you want to dance? No. No, not this time. Thank you. I think I'm going to go to my cabin because for me, a little German music goes a long way. Don't be embarrassed. Nobody is watching. Will I see you later? Later. Herr Freytag? Herr Freytag! I want to tell you how sorry I am. I wanted to tell you that with all my heart. Head? You have no hearts. Any of you. I'm sorry. I've no right to be rude to you. I have no right to be rude to anybody. You must be very much in love with your wife to stand up for her that way. My wife and I are separated. Yes. Yes! I-I thought I could face what we had to go through after we were married. I couldn't. I wasn't ready to give up my position because of my employer's prejudices. My family talked to me about it. My friends. My dear friends. So I panicked. Panicked! I asked my firm to transfer me to Mexico. You'll never believe what I did. I wrote a letter. We can't go on together. I've imagined her face a thousand times when she got the letter. That face has followed me everywhere. Now I'm going back. I don't even know where she is. But I've got to find her. Plead with her to understand. To forgive me. If she cares for you, she'll understand. Don't you see? Even if she does, I know I'll never forget. I wrote that letter. Listen to that music, Glocken. Now try to tell me you don't react to that music. Schmaltz. Tell me, Glocken, now honestly. When you hear that music wherever you are don't you have a special feeling about being a German? I'll tell you now, honestly. When I hear that music wherever I am I have a special feeling about being a dwarf. I remember being thousands of miles from home in a theater in New York. They put on a picture of the funeral of the Kaiserin Viktoria. That good woman. How much she meant to all of us. You are German, aren't you? You are the most German person I have ever met. I want to show you something. I take it out every once in a while and look at it when I want to feel good. Why, the Order of the Iron Cross! Second class. And a war hero, besides. You may be the biggest fool on this whole boat. Why do you say that? Where have you been during this voyage? Do you think this boat is a cross section of the German people? No! You don't know the average German the way I know him. The people that produced Goethe, Beethoven and Bach are not to be sneezed at. Fifty percent of the people who produced Goethe, Beethoven and Bach voted for Rieber's party last week. Forty four percent. You are blind! You're absolutely blind! You can't see what's going on in front of your own face. What do you mean? You mean this business about the Jews? You don't understand us. The German Jew is something special. We are Germans first and Jews second. We have done so much for Germany. Germany has done so much for us. A little patience. A little goodwill. It works itself out. Listen, there are nearly a million Jews in Germany. What are they going to do? Kill all of us? Karl, if you will excuse me, I want to dance with a most charming lady. Might I have the honor of this dance? Give me some money or I will kill you. Are you out of your mind? I will kill you. Johann! That's God's judgment. I don't want to hear that anymore. Don't you think I know how you've treated me? Don't you think I know how you've cheated me? Where is it? Where's the money? Top drawer. Come in. I have money. Come here. Come on. Put out my cigarette. Tell me, am I your very first girl? You are shaking. There is nothing to be afraid of. No. The first time. The first time is very important. Stop it! stop in Stop it! I'm just teaching the lady flamenco. Keep your hands off her, you pimp. Big hero. I'm sorry. I don't believe you're quite sober, Mrs. Treadwell. What could give you that impression? God, he stalks them like a mountain lion. Did you see the makeup on those girls? Do men really find that attractive? Some apparently do. I would think that men would like to know what they were kissing. I would like to know what it is like to kiss you. I have been looking at you, thinking about you for a long time. You never notice me. Why not? Now you will not kiss me? Why not? Do you want me to say I love you? I never knew what people meant by that. Don't say it. I can't bear the sound of it. Then why did you lead me on during the trip? You never considered my feelings at all, did you? No, and I'm sorry for that. Mrs. Treadwell, I'm only a third-grade officer on a second-rate ship, but it gives me an opportunity to observe people. I've seen women like you, Forty-six-year-old women who are still coquettes. They travel on boats often. Always searching for something. Do you know where that searching ends? In a nightclub with a paid escort who tells you the lies you must hear. You are a most mundane, ordinary man. How extraordinary that a man like you should say things like this to me. Probably true. I think this evening's festivities have come to an end. I shall see you to your door. It's quite unnecessary. I'll find my own way. Darling? Yeah. I didn't know there was a Frau Rieber. What do you mean, a Frau Rieber? The purser told me you sent a cable to Frankfurt addressed to Frau Rieber. I did not mention it because I could not bear the humiliation. It is the tragedy of my life. She will not let me go. I must go on supporting her and the three children. There are three child ren? They have no understanding of me. I've no understanding of them. They hang on. They hang on. They suck the life's blood out of me. They will not let go. They will not let go. I am a vital, passionate man. I need love. I must have love. Say you understand. You must understand. I understand. Now, look, I bought you a bottle of champagne. A pack of them Sultana cigarettes and two margaritas. When are we gonna get together? You have been drinking too much. I think I will go now. Tonight. Not tonight. Tonight I am tired. Tonight. Very well. Just let go of my arm. Hey. What's your cabin number? Number 14. I thought you weren't bothering with that cheapskate. I have planned something interesting for that cheapskate. I gave him the cabin of that snotty American bitch, Mrs. Treadwell. I think you are mad. I made some inquiries. They would let me stay on the island. I would be able to take care of her. I understand your feeling, her helplessness. But to give up everything. What would I be giving up? What would I be giving up? Your life! My life. My life is obligations. Obligation to nothing that's real to me. This woman over there in the cabin, she's real to me. It sounds strange. But she's the only real thing that has happened to me. You have heard of shipboard romances, haven't you? She's sold you a bill of goods, and you've fallen for it. I can see it if you can't. She wants her precious needle. She doesn't want you. This may be true. If this is true. When I had my heart attack, there was a dream I had. You can talk about death. I've seen it many times as a doctor. But you never know what it's like until it almost happens to you. I dreamed I had already died. I dreamed I was in a box. The sweat broke out all over my body. I wanted to cry out, I can't be dead, I haven't lived! Who has? Do you think this woman is the answer, Willie? A woman like this. All she's been through. She has seen everything. There are no surprises left for her. Even if it's love, Willie, I hope we can deny the myth that love lasts. You are not young, Mrs. Treadwell. You have not been young for years. Behind those old eyes, you hide a 16-year-old heart. Poor fool. Is that what men really find attractive? Well, baby. You just haven't managed to grow up. Mrs. Treadwell of Murray Hill, Virginia. NOW! You can paint your toenails green. You know how it ends, don't you? Alone. Sitting in a cafe with a paid escort. Let me go. Let me go. Mrs. Treadwell'? Excuse me. That greaser told me Cabin 14. Excuse me. Excuse me. Get out! Get out! Get out! I'm sorry, I truly am sorry. I didn't know it... Pig! Hey, what the hell? Go on. Get out. Get out. Get out! Get out! You were sleeping. I know. You cried out again. Did I? What is it? It's nothing. It had to be something. It was ridiculous. Tell me. Promise you won't laugh. I won't laugh. It's something I saw the time I went to Taxco. A flash passing on the bus. It was a man and a woman. A crowd had gathered. They were staggering and swaying. I thought they were dancing. The man had his hand raised and there was a long knife in it. The woman's breast and stomach were pierced. The blood was so thick her skirt was sticking to her legs. She was beating him with a stone. I'll never forget the look on their faces. It wasn't all hatred. It was like there was some great bond between them in that hatred. And then they struck again. I always dream about it in some grotesque variation. Tonight I was one of the watchers, as if I were at a play. Then something happened. What happened? The features changed. And? David, the faces were yours and mine. Good evening, doctor. Night, doctor. Thank you for bringing us home, capitan. The cuisine and the accommodations were superb. They've come for me? For me, the voyage is over. I have here an order for something that will help you. Any doctor will accept it. Oh, Willie. You try so hard. My darling. My love. For once, let's kiss in broad daylight. Bye. I think we ought to be able to reach Bremerhaven by Thursday morning. Willie, you're drinking up my best Cognac. Not that I mind, but that isn't the thing you should be doing, is it? You shouldn't be doing this. I know you're still thinking about her. She'll be all right. By now, I'll guarantee she's found someone to help her. A woman like that always finds someone. Shut up! Willie. That's a hell of a way to waste good brandy, Willie. When I think of the things I've seen on this ship. The stupid cruelties. The vanities. We talk about values? There's no values. The dung we base our lives on. She looked into the garbage dump. She did something about it. We are the intelligent, civilized people who carry out orders we are given. No matter what they may be. Our biggest mission in life is to avoid being fools. And we wind up being the biggest fools of all. Why didn't I go? Come in. Herr doctor, Frau Lutz wants to see you. Her daughter Elsa is not feeling well. I'm coming. To hell with them, Willie. You rest here. You don't look well. You should see the way you look. That is exactly what I mean. - Good evening. - Good evening. You called me? Doctor, can you give Elsa a purge? Take two of those before you retire. Doctor, aren't you going to take her temperature? I think he's been drinking. I can just hear you saying, "What has all this to do with us?" Nothing.
