THE SECRET Before I'm fired, I swear I'll get you all fired. One by one, all together. One against thousand and there is a new case every third day. 33 robberies in three months... like the age of Jesus! But on that cross I can't do it for your cocks. What about the money? Where did it go? - Where do I know? - Bonjour. Commissioner. The inspector is back... Come on, come on guys! Leave us alone. Come on, come on! Well found. Commissioner... Come on, close that door! Out! What a pleasure to see you again. You've no idea what a pleasure! It's been a year already, my friend. This day always comes back, another year without her. Time flies, flies. Here, how are you? How are you? There's a guy with a scooter that keeps me awake at night. He seems to try robbing all of Rome. From the center to the outskirts. All. I fail to catch him, he's slippy like an eel... Always I almost get him and then he disappears. He has more ass than soul, as they say in Paris. Come, I'll show you... Look. "Lonely robber escapes the police". And your wife? The children? That's a bit bigger problem. When I have time I tell you. A mess anyway. I can't go home anymore. I can't look them in the eye. You, the boys... I can't do it, I'm hot. I have completely lost my mind... she is young... so young... I can't get it right anymore... My friend you must help me. I'm bad, I'm really bad. I need you, a friend, the "French" I need. Help me. If you can. - You too. - I'm here. Elizabeth how is she? I don't know. How are you? I told you, I don't know. Come on... All right. I'll inquire and then I tell you. Check them out. Valeria? So I'm there this afternoon? Yes, thanks. What are you doing? Ninth. - But are you always lawful? Don't you ever get tired? - No. - Nobody reads anymore. - Yes. So? Then she doesn't want to see you. Did you tell her I'm back? Yes. It is my biggest failure. - It wasn't your fault. - Then what was it? She is always here. The Coyotes... He leaves with his tail between his legs. There are many. Today you give me more. I want more. I'll give you what we agreed. I'm only with you because it suits me. Count go. She is young. Yes. What's your name? Monia. They illuminate. Yes. - Hello? - Elizabeth... I told you, I don't want to see you. Find the motorcycle that ran over our daughter. Find that motorcycle. Only call me when you've found that killer. That dog that killed her. I want him dead. This is the only way to end this story, the only way. THE PLEASURE Do you know this guy who does robberies with a scooter? We're urgently after that guy. Nobody knows him. How can it be you don't get him? He's not like the others. He is clever, and he doesn't do it for the money. He plays. He mucked us yet another time. Abandoned the scooter and disappeared. He's unpredictable, I dunno where he comes from, he fears nothing. No accidents, no unexpected events. He always anticipates us. I can't keep up. I guess he's also lucky. Luck doesn't exist. Those who succeed are smart. Sure. However Bravo is good. He knows all about scooters. He steals them, modifies the license plates. He's like a kid having fun. A young boy... Why not? He is small, thin, then you have seen how fast he goes. I know a cafe. The Inpunto D'avero. I'll increase the roadblocks. Increase controls in the city. Then we'll see if I still get screwed. So you can't find him. This is another story, it's a challenge. Marco? Marco... Let's go, come on. Yes. Have a good time. THE INTUITION Oh, what are you doing here? What time is it? I was sleeping like a moron... what is it? You have to start with the traffic from the city. Your robber doesn't run away by chance. That's interesting. I'll help you... I'm here. I was expecting you. - This is for you, no fly. - Thank you. Listen, how much did he take home from 35 robberies? Uh? - Two million? - Who the fuck has ever seen him? Thin ankles, light hands... our biker is a woman. What the fuck are you saying? Get me the list of all female bikers. Which list? Rome has two or three female drivers like this. Precisely. If I'm right, the field narrows. Anyways, then I'm looking at all those who have these precedents. I don't think there are many. The right one has written it in her eyes. I care about this job, I care a lot. But if he doesn't give me a chance to prove it. Owls. THE MEETING The city is big, millions of people... ... but in the end we always meet. Who are you looking for? One who runs away. I didn't do anything, nothing serious... - Just talk to the bank and everything will be sorted out? - Yes. From tomorrow you're dismissed, you are an incapable idiot. Take your things, you'll get your two cents that settle it. You can leave right away. I keep Valeria, she's quick and doesn't talk. Don't take that one, there's a fixed traffic light that lasts too long. Then take the second left, it's a dark street with no intersections. Come on... Right. Go all the way around because there are Chinese who unload all night. - Why not kill the Chinese? - What? We'll just kill them, like this. Got it? Huh? No. The white one... Come on! Come on! Be careful. Marco! Stop it, Marco stop it! I break everything! Come here, here. Go away! Listen... Let's stay rational. I don't forgive stupidity. Get this fucking scooter. Here we go! Come on! - This is new, huh? - Get out! Marco, give me 20 euros. You know I don't tell anyone that you steal motorcycles. Brum, brum, brum! - Do not touch. - Pretty. If I give you 20 euros, will you go away? Here... THE AGREEMENT Were you waiting for me? For a while. July 1993. 110 and praise. Then a PhD, and the thesis published in America. Mathematics can take a lifetime. Where are you from? Paris. I've never been there. Big cities are all the same. A coffee? Coffee. Good and strong, Italian style. A coffee... for the gentleman. Frenchman! C'mon. I'll take you for a ride. What a nice car. Yes. It was my father's. Where there is discord, where there is hatred, you bring love. I never found out who killed... my daughter. She was... thirteen. A motorcycle ran her over. I started drinking... ... and it's all over. I haven't been able to protect my daughter... ... and my wife has never forgiven me. The killer you never found is called Marco. He's fixing my bikes. He told me many times, that a few years ago he killed a girl with his bike. And you know what he does while he tells me? He laughs. You need him, you don't need me. His workshop is in Mandrione. You let an old hag boss you around. She's not old... And an old hag. She has a lot of money. She buys you. Don't say it again. Don't say it again. Uh? Ok. I won't say it again. THE ESCAPE I found her. 50 years old, employed. She has no relationships, she is alone. What about all the money she makes? Nothing, just flees. A 50-year-old employee? Huh? I needed a Frenchman to understand it, oh well. When will we get her? Today. It will start at Mandrione's workshop. Uh... I need your car. You come... This is the last one, it must be perfect. Here she is! Commissioner went out. Guys, be sure to stay behind. I don't want to lose her! Here we go. We lost her. We are at the crossroads after the arches, we try to the left. To all units: we are looking for a black maxi scooter, plate number CM13471. I repeat CM13471. She's a woman, she's armed. Spotted a black scooter, plate number CM13471 in Cinecittà. It's impossible. Here she is, we are in EUR. But how in EUR? Spotted in Santa Maria Maggiore. She has now passed on the Flaminia. On the Flaminia? A black scooter CM13471 passed by us. We are at Pigneto. But how many fucking scooters are there? One or 2000? She mucked me again, even changed the license plates! Valeria are you crazy? What have I done to you? I've always treated you well. Bum! But what game is it? THE PRESENT Is that him? He says Paris, that's a city. Champs-Élysées, Lido, Pigalle and L'Opera. But maybe London is better than Paris. It's like an old lady who mirrors herself in the Thames. And "New York" is a modern metropolis. I say, oh well, but do you know eternal Rome? You don't know Rome... 'cause then you'd understand that Rome is magic. And you don't understand that you want to be enchanted That the blue sky seems fake. Nuns then understood that Rome is beautiful and it's people are light-hearted and kind you feel at home... What parts do you know in Rome. Landing strips, huh... You don't know... Rome. Thank you, thank you very much. Bravo. - Bravo. - Thanks. Sometimes I enjoy singing, it relaxes me. But do they pay you? No, what should they pay me for? Shouldn't I pay to let me sing? Thank you, I needed it. I'm glad to hear it. - She escaped again. - Uh-uh. You'll never get her. Yes, we will get her. Two months, three months... just a matter of time. We'll find her by the sea, like an inflated tube. We all end up in the same place anyway. But what happened to this money? What if they don't find it... - Two million. - Uh-Uh. As I said. And where the fuck are they? Let's make fifty-fifty. No? Come on, sing again! Something more cheerful. I'll do it... For you. BLUE EYES Well, Valeria, your treatment ends with this visit. Your vision is now perfect. You see well both far and up close. You can drive car, motorbike, bicycle, whatever you want. And you can go as fast as you like.
