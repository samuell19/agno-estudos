[AIRPLANES APPROACHING] [MEN SHOUTING] [AIR RAID SIREN WAILING] FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: Yesterday, December 7th, 1941... a date which will live in infamy... the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation, and at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its Emperor... Hey, Allister. What's going on? Look out. Watch out. looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing the American island of Oahu... * Silent night the Japanese ambassador... * Holy night * All is calm delivered to our Secretary of State... * All is bright ...a formal reply to a recent American message * Mother and child While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. [CHEERING] I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ON RADIO] Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God. [APPLAUSE] I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire. [APPLAUSE] RADIO ANNOUNCER: That was the President in a joint address to Congress and the nation earlier today. The intercontinental radio news will continue to repeat the President's message and bring you current developments on yesterday's attack. We return to our program of dance music. [**] [TURNS RADIO DOWN] Today in geography class, Mr. MacMillan showed us where Pearl Harbor was. It's pretty darn near the other side of the world. That's not the only place they hit. I was talking to a couple of guys after practice, and they say they bombed Alaska too. Yeah, and the guy on the radio said that there were Jap subs waiting off of California, too. - [KNOCKING] - Hey, guys, let me out. This isn't funny anymore, all right? Come on. Hi, Allister. What's it doing? Snowing again? Yes, and it's cold as hell, too, so let me in, please. [LAUGHS] [WINDOW SLIDES OPEN] Nice talk, choir boy. It can't be cold as hell. You know, it is downright pathetic when a little kid tries cussing to act grown up. Since when do you care? You're my brother, not my mother. Oh, cut him some slack, will you, Kipp? You were a lot worse when you first got here. Yeah, well, my folks gave me a lot more to cuss about, Tim. What are you writing to Mom and Dad about? It's none of your god damn business, and why the hell aren't you in choir practice? Are you kidding? I ditched. The Japs could be bombing campus and old Jenkins is still holding choir practice. Besides, I have to tell you guys something I heard. Do Mom and Dad know you skipped choir practice? Do Mom and Dad know you started smoking again? You'd probably tell them, too, wouldn't you, you little snitch? Relax, Kipp. [WHISPERING] Geez, what's with him? He spent two hours in Thurston's office this afternoon. Could you mind your own business, Russell? Hey, Kipp, what's up? I mean, why'd you have a run-in with Thurston for anyhow? Look, it's nothing. Just forget it, okay? It's just that you said-- It's no big deal. Just drop it. Hey, Allister... what were you so fired up about, anyhow? Oh, God, I almost forgot. You know Stanley Burns, that kind of goofy kid in my class with that big, old raspberry birthmark on his neck? Well, he was busing the headmaster's table tonight, and he had to stay late on account of old Thurston and all the class hotshots sitting around, drinking coffee, and talking about what the President said and all. Is there a point to this, Allister? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, Stanley heard Thurston saying that all the seniors who were going to enlist right away could go home early for Christmas, spend a little time with their families before shipping out. Where would you go for a war? Europe? The Pacific Ocean? Well, it's not just on the radio anymore, guys. Now it's our war. If you're going to join right away. Yeah, well, I am. The stinking Japs pulled a cheap shot. We're going to show them that they can't get away with it. Hell, you heard the President. I bet we got these Japs wrapped up by this time next year, and if those Nazis want to get in it, we're just going to have to whip them, too. Well, maybe it ain't such a good idea to jump right into this thing, Tim. Oh, Jesus, Russell. Captain America ain't going to save the day. It's up to us. This is an honest- to-goodness, real, live war we're going to be fighting, guys. and a fella's got to do what he's supposed to do, right, Kipp? I think a fella ought to do what he thinks he should. Damn straight. Serve his country. Look, all I'm saying is, let's find out what's going on first. Stuart sat at Thurston's table tonight. When he gets home, we can ask him. Hell, I've got to get packed. Kipp, see if you can talk some sense into this guy. You thinking on joining up, too? Maybe. Maybe not. Then why are you getting all packed up? Is it any of your god damn business, Allister? You know, you're in a real pissy mood tonight. I'm going to go next door and wait for Stuart. You think the war will go on long? Hell, no. We're going to kick ass. The way I figure it, with all these ships we lost, it could take a while. Oh, well... while I'm off serving my country and living a part of history, you'll still be here. Kipp's packing, too. Of course he is. We're a team. We stick together. If I go Navy, Kipp'll go Navy. Wow, the Navy. You and Kipp in the Navy. How about that? Yeah. We'll probably serve on some destroyer. Some big-ass battleship. Sail all over the Pacific and back. Tropical islands, tropical women. Swimming in water as blue as the sky. Boy, it's going to be something. Bet you'll be the fastest swimmer in the Navy. I don't know. There's thousands of guys joining up. I'm sure there'll be a bunch faster than me. I wish I was a better swimmer or a better ball player. Even a little bit taller. Well, not everybody can be athletic, Allister. I mean, you're good at book stuff. Brainy stuff. Heck, I bet you're smarter than most of the seniors at the school. You see here? Before Steve Rogers drank Dr. Reinstein's super-serum and became Captain America, he tried to join the Army, but they had him declared 4-F on account of his being so scrawny and weak. Anyways, now he's smashing Nazi spies. I can't wait to see what he does to those Japs. Russell, it's a comic book. Colored ink, newspaper. Oh, I know, but I was thinking that even if I tried to join up now, they might not even take me, like old Steve Rogers. Remember, I've got that flat foot condition and I had to wear those really bad shoes until I was 15, and then-- Russell. Russell! What? Never mind. Hey, Stuart. What's up? This damned weather. Damned bombing. They've gone and canceled tomorrow's chess tourney with Middlebury. No, not the chess tourney. That's it. These Japs have gone too far. - This means war. - Okay, okay, your sarcasm isn't appreciated, Mitchell. What are you doing? Get off my bed. Come on. All right. I wasn't hurting anything. - Jesus. - What time is it? Aren't you supposed to be back at your own dormitory by this time? Why is everybody so worried where I'm supposed to be, anyway? Oh, oh, they stopped enforcing the sophomore curfew? I'm sorry, I didn't hear that, Allister. Oh, give it a rest, will you, Stuart? What are you doing? Packing. The word is, Thurston's letting all the seniors who are going to enlist go home early for Christmas. Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that, huh? What, are you denying it? Hey, guys, Stuart's back! Well, it's about time! Come on, Stuart, give. What's going on? How should I know? You had dinner with Thurston tonight. What did he say? Look, any information I have as a result of my dinner conversation with Headmaster Thurston is certainly not for public broadcast. So something is up? You're going to make this difficult, aren't you, Stuart? Nothing difficult about it. You'll all just have to wait for the announcement at breakfast tomorrow. Look, Stuart, this is very important. We don't have time for games. So why don't you just drop the conceited asshole bit for about five minutes and tell us what Thurston said? No. If you don't mind, Mitchell... I've got finals to study for. Let me put it another way, Stuart. Kipp? Tim? Swirly time! Hey, I'm not one of your crude swimmer friends who enjoys this sort of thing! Nobody enjoys being on the porcelain end of a swirly. Hey, you guys, this is really immature! No, not really. Do it! Are you going to tell us what Thurston said, Stuart? Yes. Yes, I will. Just please let me out, Mitchell. Come on. Gosh, you are one of the most irritating... no-class human beings-- Stuart! Just tell us what Thurston said. Well, I'm certainly not going to carry on a conversation with four other people in a bathroom. Excuse me. A bus will leave campus tomorrow at 4:00. It'll take any seniors who want to enlist to the train station in Middlebury... [CLEARS THROAT] ...and from there, it's home to your local recruiting officers. - What about finals? - Do we get to graduate? Are any other schools doing this? That's it. That's all I know. I suppose we'll hear more details tomorrow at breakfast. Tomorrow, we're leaving. You're with me, right, Kipp? Huh? You're with me? Right. With you, Tim. Okay, Russell, what's it going to be? I don't know. I don't think so. It may be right for you right now, but I'm not sure. Russell, where's your sense of duty? Of commitment? I mean, this is our time to fight. This is... To leave Green Mountain behind and see the world. I mean, come on, we're going to be in this together. I understand what you're saying, Tim, but I can't. I can't leave Green Mountain now, not if I don't have to. Well, you might have to anyway, if the draft age is low enough. You're going to be 18 in a few months. Look, my folks have worked really hard for me to be able to go to school here. They don't have a lot of money, and they're going without a lot for me to be here right now. Neither one of them even got to go to college, and I am. I can't disappoint them. Well, you can still do all that... after the war. You can come back and pick up right where you left off. No. I can't. You've got to understand. That you can't... or you won't? Hey, Tim, let it go. I just don't understand how you can turn your back on your own country. I'm not turning my back on anything. I've just got my priorities. Yeah, well, if you're not on that bus tomorrow, you're turning your back on all those guys at Pearl. Yeah. Well, I've got finals to study for, so... Oh, Jesus, Russell! Why don't you grow up and accept some responsibility for once? Pull your nose out of the comic books and live life in the god damn real world? Hey, Tim. Just relax, okay? Tim, I'm sorry. I'd really hate for you to think that I'm letting you down. Well, you are. Yeah. Hey, Russell, wait. He's doing what he feels he has to, Tim. Jesus, he looks up to you! Do you know how hard it was for him to stand here and tell you he wasn't going? Yeah, well, he's wrong. You're wrong! Well, Russell isn't the only one with finals to study for, so if you gentlemen, and I use the term loosely, will excuse me... You know, I should have figured you weren't going, Stuart. That's right, Tim, I'm not. Oh, yeah? And why is that? Not that I owe you any explanation, but I'll tell you why. You see, a country at war not only needs manpower for its armies, but it needs to supply that army with guns, tanks, planes, ships, and all the other equipment it takes to run a war. The government doesn't just pull open some big gym bag and pull this stuff out, Mitchell. It's got to be manufactured, and that's why my father's factories are gearing up to switch over to the production of war goods. Oh, it sounds like your father talking. No, it's me talking. Stuart, we're young. We belong fighting in this war. I'm sorry... but I'm staying. You know, I thought that maybe, somewhere deep inside you, you had a feeling of obligation, responsibility. I mean, you live in a country which allows you and your family to acquire so much, and now, when they need you, what do you do? You walk away. It's not like that, Tim. I'll be doing my part. Yeah, well, your part isn't good enough. Oh, yeah? Who are you to judge me, huh? You are getting way out of hand with this. Look, I have to study. Okay? RADIO ANNOUNCER: Reports from the Pacific indicate that fierce fighting continues at this hour at sea and on land. Japanese troops have invaded Thailand and North Malaya. Hey, wait. Keep that on. [SWING MUSIC PLAYING] Let's just listen to the music, okay? Yeah, sure. How many times do you think you've read that? A bunch. How come you don't want to listen to the news? Well, they keep saying the same thing. I know what's going on. I know what's happening. What is it? Captain America. Yeah? What about him? I mean, he's going to have to go fight in the war. He can't stay here going after spies and saboteurs anymore. We're in the war. He's got to go, and I know he's smarter and faster and stronger than the other guys, but in a war, there's bombs and bullets flying at you from all sides, and his titanium shield'll only cover one side at a time. What if he gets hit, Allister? He can't be able to go to the war and die. All of those people die in wars. I mean, they get shot or blown up and... and when they're dead, that's it. Those guys at Pearl Harbor... they're already dead. Some of them probably never even saw it coming. Is, uh... is that why you don't want to go off and fight in the war? I don't want to die, Allister. Does that make me chicken? Who knows? I don't know. But it's true, it really is, and I'm only trying to make you at least partially aware of your own personality flaws. Well, I ain't flawed. You're telling Russell and I that we're staying for all the wrong reasons. Well, you're going with the wrong attitude. It's not so much duty and honor to you as it... as it is just plain beating the Japs, showing them who's stronger. For you, it's just one big swim meet in the Pacific. You know, you always think you got people figured out, Stuart. Well, you're wrong. Okay, fine. How about this? We take the fastest Japanese swimmer and you, and we stick the both of you in some pool on an island between here and Japan, then the two of you do 50 yards freestyle, and the one who wins wins the war. That's dumb. Aha, but you actually thought about it for a minute. Face it, Mitchell. You're looking for a fight. No, the Japs are the ones who came looking for a fight, and I sure as hell am going to give them one. Oh, what, you personally? No. Kipp, me, and a whole bunch of real Americans. Americans who are willing to fight. Guys who are willing to lay it all on the line. None of this bullshit about helping out the war effort in some damn factory. You don't hear Kipp spouting some chicken shit line like that, do you? Look, I'm going to let that comment pass, all right? Because I consider you a friend. Yeah, well, don't do me any favors, Stuart. Look, why don't you just get off your patriotic soapbox already, because I've heard all I care to. Yeah? Well, you're going to hear a lot more! You know, sometimes you can be so smug. Anyone who's not playing the game your way isn't playing right. You're so full of yourself, so... so god damn sure of yourself. "Oh, I'm going to go join the Navy." "Kipp and I are going to fight the Japs." What? You're not really going to go off and fight in that war, are you? Why don't you level with him? Why don't you level with us? Hold it right there. What the hell are you talking about, Stuart? Why not ask Kipp? Kipp knows what I mean. Don't you, Kipp? Don't you? You see, the war wasn't the only topic of discussion at the dinner conversation you were all so eager to find out about. Our friend Kipp here was mentioned a couple times. If memory serves me correct, Headmaster Thurston referred to Kipp as a bad influence. Disruptive Kipp, troublemaker Kipp... expelled Kipp. - Kipp, what happened? - Kipp, no. Headmaster Thurston said he wouldn't even expect a selfish little delinquent like Kipp Gibbs to even serve his country in a time of need. Was he right, Kipp? You know something, Mitchell? If I'm a chicken shit for not going, then our friend Kipp here is a chicken shit for running away from Green Mountain. Sure, he's packing up, but he's not going where you are. He's getting the hell out of here before anybody finds out he's being expelled. Catching a ride on the old glory bus, eh? Is that the plan, Kipp? Why the hell are you doing this, Stuart? Because you're so blind. Kipp here can do no wrong. Kipp's brave, loyal, and trustworthy. He's a god damn boy scout, and all I am is a conceited, chicken shit asshole who's good for a laugh if we stuff his head in the toilet. Well, you're not laughing now, are you, Mitchell? Jesus, Stuart. Is that what this is about? A joke a couple of hours ago? No. It's more than that. You son of a bitch! Oh, what are you going to do, beat me up? Is that what you're getting kicked out for? For all the fighting? For what you did to that Curtis kid in P.E. class? - Kipp didn't start that. - Oh? Then what are you getting kicked out for, Kipp? Why don't you just tell us? Because it's none of your god damn business, that's why. Tim, I'm not going to enlist, and I'm not getting on any bus either. I'm going to get the hell out of Green Mountain tonight. - Where are you going to go? - Of course you're going to enlist. - We're going to join the Navy, Kipp. - No, Tim, we're not. - But you said... - No, I didn't! You just got it in your head that way. You were so certain that I was going to go. You were so sure! I couldn't even tell you that I wasn't going. Well, Kipp, we can go. We will go, Kipp. It's... it's you and me, Kipp. I mean, this bull shit with Thurston doesn't matter. It doesn't matter why you got kicked out, Kipp. You're free to go. Tim.... Tim, you don't understand. No, you're damn right I don't, Kipp! What the hell is going on? Look, I just need to get out of here, all right? No, Kipp, wait. We'll work it out, okay? - I need to be alone. - Kipp, wait! Maybe I should go on after him. No, just leave him alone a minute. You can be a real shit sometimes. You know, Stuart, I should kick your ass. What the hell did you think you were doing, huh? I don't know. I just... I mean, I... Well, I thought that... That's the problem. You didn't think. Fine. I don't need any of you guys either. Kipp? Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. What the hell do you want? Aren't you finished humiliating me yet? Look... I just brought you your cap. Thanks. I really just want to be left alone, all right? Kipp... I need to talk to you. Haven't you said enough already? Why don't you just get the hell out of here? Oh, please, just hear me out. Fine. You stay, I'll go. No, wait. I'll go. I just wanted to apologize for what I said and did. I know it was pretty rotten. That's all. You treated me like dirt, Stuart, for no good reason. Look, I'm sorry. I said it. Kipp, I'll keep on saying it as long as you want me to, but I cannot undo what I did. Why did you do it, Stuart? Why did you say all those things in front of everybody? I guess... I just wanted to shut Tim up. I wanted to hit him, but I knew he'd just put me through the wall... and I knew cutting you down in front of him would really get him. Tonight at dinner, when Thurston was saying all those things about me, - did you say anything? - No. No, I didn't say anything. I just sat there and I kept quiet. I wanted so badly to shout out, Kipp. I wanted to... I wanted to tell them to shut up. Just shut up! I wanted to yell across the table and tell Thurston that... that he was a dirty liar and a pompous fool, and that Kipp Gibbs was a friend of mine, but I didn't. God, why didn't I? Thurston never said why I was being expelled? No. No, he hinted at a couple things, but... Do you want to hear a story? Look... it's your business and none of mine. You don't have to tell me anything. I was wrong to try and make you. No, I want to. You know that... 10 guys a year out of the senior class fall victim to Thurston for English tutorial, and I'm one of the lucky bastards that got him. About two weeks ago, I had a book report due. It was due on Monday, so the Friday before I was in the library trying to find a book. It was real quiet. Nobody was there, because they were getting ready to close up, and all of a sudden I heard yelling. There's no more discussion. Get going. It was Thurston. That's censorship. He was mad as hell and arguing with Miss Langley. Where does it stop? Answer me that. I wasn't sure what they were talking about, but Thurston was waving some book around and Miss Langley was trying to get it back. She was really upset. Thurston is such a bastard. This didn't happen. It was burnt a little bit, but it hadn't torched up yet. Now, I'm not a big reader or anything, but I knew that if Thurston didn't want that book read, I was going to read it. It was about war, and this fellow named Joe who was in the Great War. He'd been hurt real bad. He had no arms or legs. He was deaf, pretty much of his face was blown off. About the only thing he could do was think, and what he thought about was the war. I read the whole book... in that one night... and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. This book, it made me see how crazy war is. First... First they start name-calling, and then they start shouting, and then, when they can't shout anymore, they start shooting each other... and then, when the smoke clears, they'll sit down, and they'll talk peace and they'll sort it all out. And you told all this to Thurston? Yeah. I put it all in my book report. The son of a bitch hauls me into his office this afternoon and he starts lecturing me. He lectures me about God and country and that's what Green Mountain is all about... and then he tells me I'm being expelled, because I'm a bad influence. He doesn't want everyone to know what the real reason is. That son of a bitch couldn't throw me into the fire... so he did the next best thing. Stuart, I'm so glad that you and Russell aren't going. I wish to God that Tim wasn't. Then tell him, Kipp. You know, I'm not the only one who should hear this story. He wouldn't understand. I'd lose him as a friend. No. You need to make him understand, or you will lose him as a friend. Apology accepted. Thanks, Kipp. What do you say we get the hell out of here? I'm freezing my ass off. Yeah, me too. [WIND HOWLING] A book? You're not going because of some book? Is that all you saw in those pages, Tim? I hoped that that would help you understand some of the things I'm trying to understand myself. Bullshit. This was for Thurston. We've been through too much together, Kipp. You owe me a better explanation than to hand me some god damn lousy book report! Real lousy, in fact. He got an F. - Shut up, Russell. - Bite my head off. I was just making a joke. Hell, I've seen you get in fights over a seat in the auditorium. This is a fight for something that really matters. Come on, Kipp. Two weeks ago, I probably would have agreed with you, Tim, but now... I don't think I can make any sense out of war. And what about the guys at Pearl? What about them, Kipp? Do they help you make any sense out of this at all? What, revenge? That kind of sense? Any eye for an eye? They killed our guys, so let's kill theirs? Maybe a little revenge isn't such a bad idea. Besides, Kipp, that's not the only way to look at it. The President called on us to serve. Oh, that's brilliant. Some guy comes along and he taps you on the shoulder and says, "Hey, Tim, come die for us," and you're going to go. You know, you have a pretty selfish way of thinking about this. Do I? Some things are worth fighting for. Maybe even dying for, Kipp. You're right. Some things are worth dying for, but that's different for each person. Russell, you're back in Dallas with your mom and you're shopping downtown, when this truck goes out of control and jumps the curb. You have just enough time to push your mom out of the way or save yourself. What do you do? I... I don't like this story, Kipp. Knock on wood. [KNOCKS] What do you do, Russell? I'd push her out of the way. It's a dumb question. Of course he saves his mom. And chooses to give up his life because it's worth it to him. No, it's a reflex. Your mom's in trouble, you save your mom, and when your country's in trouble, - you serve your country. - Why? Because the President called on us to serve? Tim, there's always somebody who's willing to sacrifice some other guy's life. They're usually the ones that are waving flags, making speeches, and shouting slogans. Politicians will send people off to die in a war like it's a game of chess. They'll tell you about the glory of war and they'll keep the rest all their dirty, little secret. Thurston throws a book in the fire, then at dinner, he sits there and talks about the suppression of ideas and the fight for democracy in Europe. Right. Hitler's burning books over there, and Thurston's doing the same exact thing right here. Tim, every guy who gets on that bus tomorrow never had a choice. They don't know what war is. All they know is what Thurston wanted them to know, what Thurston wanted them to read. He made their choices for them. Is that democracy? In all the years I've known you, you've never walked away from a fight, Kipp. What'd you have to go and read that book for, anyhow? This is about more than a book, Tim. Remember that meet at Concord when I got in a fight with those jerks who said I was crowding their lane? Who was it that jumped out of the bleachers and got into it with me? You did. I need you on this one, too, Kipp. I'm sorry, Tim, but I can't back you up on this. You know, you're just like them. You're scared to fight, Kipp. No, I think you're worse, because you don't feel the least bit guilty, do you? You're just hiding behind some stream of bullshit and you're sneaking out of here in the middle of the night. Tim, don't say that. Please, listen to me and understand what I'm saying. No, you know, maybe Thurston is right about you. You are a bad influence. Look at them. Look what you've done to them, Kipp! Okay, Tim. Do what you feel you have to, but I can't enlist right now. All right. I will. - Where are you going? - I think Tim's right. Do we know how to spend a fun evening or what? Look... Kipp, you told him how you felt. The rest is up to him. Yeah. Do you guys know what time it is? It's a little after midnight. I think my dad's still up. I'm going to go down the hall and call him up. Hey, Kipp, do you have any more of those cookies that your mom sent you? No, I gave them all to Allister. I'm starved. Allister... I just can't figure him out. He's just a kid, Russell, but he thinks he's so grown up. Yeah, little brothers can be that way sometimes. How would you know? You're an only child. Well, exactly. I mean, that gives me an objective view of the situation, and besides, with Allister around all the time, it kind of feels like I've got a little brother. Yeah, well, I bet he wishes he were Tim's little brother right now and not mine. No. I think it's just kind of a hero worship. I mean, all the freshman and sophomores look up to him. I mean, he's a champion swimmer. He's Green Mountain's best. Don't you think we all kind of look up to Tim as a hero? Yeah, a hero and a son of a bitch. [KNOCKS] Tim. I, uh, was just packing, and I found a few things that belonged to you, Kipp. I figured I'd better return them. Just put them on that chair. - I got your blue shirt. - You might as well keep it. I'm sure you've stretched the shoulders all to hell. No, I only wore it the once. Hey, look, I even found your New York World's Fair mug. That's your mug, Tim. I gave it to you. Don't you remember? Really? Thanks. Say, listen, if you come across any of my stuff, just hold onto it for me, will you? Hell, I probably won't be missing it. Oh, except that Rita Hayworth picture. I want to take that with me. Well, let me see if I can find it. It's no rush. Hey, Tim, you got any food over in your room? I'm starved. No, but you might try the dining hall, sneak in that back window that doesn't latch. I do it all the time when I stay late for practice. Good idea. Yeah, actually, I could go for a bite to eat. I'm going to go see if Allister wants to go with us. Look, I can't find it. Why don't you come with us, Kipp? I'm not hungry, Russell. The fellow in this book got hurt pretty bad, huh? Yeah. He lost both his arms and his legs? And his face. At least he didn't die. Russell, it was worse than being dead. You all set? Yeah. See you later, Kipp? I don't know, Tim. Kipp? What, Allister? I think it'd be a good thing if you came with us. I'm tired, Allister. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of arguing. I don't want to go. Come with us. Please? Ye... Yes, Father, I know, but... Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah, sounds great. Bye. Where are you guys going? Dining hall. Yeah, to polish off some leftovers. Why don't you come with us? You're asking me to join you? Yeah, that's the idea, Stuart. Thanks. All right. All right, let's go. [WHISTLING] You're doing it again, Mitchell. You're whistling the school song. I could always play my harmonica. - No. - No. Thanks a lot, guys. You're pretty quiet all of a sudden, Russell. Has the evil Red Skull got your tongue? No. It's this place and Pearl Harbor. I mean, it seems so far away, it's... - Yeah. - It's like another planet. It's hard to believe it can be so quiet and peaceful here, when somewhere else in the world there's a war going on. Guys... Guys, guys! Listen. How do Germans tie their shoes? I don't know. I don't know. In little Nazis. [HOOTING AND LAUGHING] That was worse than the last one. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Maybe Pearl Harbor wasn't really bombed. What? No, no, no, like that, uh... that radio gag about those Martians a couple years ago. Allister, don't be stupid. No. Pearl Harbor was definitely bombed. [SIGHS] When I talked to my father a while ago... he'd just gotten off the telephone with a friend in Washington. Anyway, this fellow... he said that more than 2,000 guys were killed, and they still were finding bodies. The President said that there were casualties, but... Over 2,000? Makes you stop and think, huh? It should. You know something? This may be the last time we're all together. For a while, at least. I mean, when this war's over, we're all getting back together again, right, guys? - Yeah. - Why'd those Japs have to go starting a war with us, anyhow? Seems pretty stupid, doesn't it? I mean, it makes me mad! Like I want to hit something. You know, hit it hard! You got the right idea there, chief. You want to hit something, Allister? Why don't you hit this? Well, come on! Hit it! Here's your 1938 Champion Season ball, Thurston! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! - My turn. - We need music. Yeah! [PLAYING RAGTIME MUSIC] Okay, look out, squirt. Come on, Tim, bust a window. This one's going to the cheap seats. Hey, you guys... [WHOOPING AND CHEERING] We're going to get caught. Oh, come on. Relax, Stuart. Hit something. No, really. I mean it. Come on, take off your jacket. Okay. Thank you, Allister. Here we go. Good job, Stuart. - Give me another ball. - Come on. Sorry, Stuart, that was the last one. - Prepare to defend yourself. - Get him, Allister. Go on, Stuart. Give him a fight. Here comes Gibbs down the left side. He's challenging Mitchell. He fakes it! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, what an amazing play! Not very coordinated outside of a pool, are you? Oh, slash, slash! It's a fight between Gibbs and Mitchell, ladies and gentlemen. It's a real brawl! They're tearing each other apart! [RUSSELL PLAYS AN OMINOUS CHORD] - Gotcha. - Yeah. Don't leave us. Hang on! He was so young. He's a fighter. He'll make it. - He'll pull through. - Well, maybe not. [APPLAUSE] I always wondered. Does your dad look like he does in that picture? A little older. A little grayer. Definitely a little heavier. He still fits that uniform, though. He puts it on every Armistice Day. Was your dad going to school here when the World War started? No. He had already graduated, but he signed up the first day America got into it. Does he... talk about when he was in the war? Only constantly. I mean, even tonight on the telephone. He never quits. He wants you to go, doesn't he? That's what he said to you tonight on the phone, isn't it? My father expects, and gets the best. The biggest boat on the sound, the best wine in the restaurant, the first class train tickets. Everything is to his specifications... and then there's me. He can send me to the same school he went to, but I'll never be like him. I'm not afraid to go, Tim. I'm not even afraid to die. I mean, we're all going to die someday, right? When your number's up, it's just up... but going off to fight bravely just won't be enough. My father was a hero. An honest-to-goodness god damn hero. One of the most decorated soldiers in the World War. Every Armistice Day, he shows me each medal and tells me what they were for. He was a god damn hero, and I'm not! Sure, I'll go off, and I'll come back and I'll say, "Look, Daddy, here... Here's my good conduct medal." I can't do that! I won't do that! If your father's half the hero you say he is, he should be proud of you just for serving. I can't be... what he expects me to be. I don't know. Why don't you give him the benefit of the doubt? He sounds pretty self-serving to me. What about your parents? They're not the least bit self-righteous? - No. - Sure they are. Three PhDs between the two of them, and they can't even see beyond their own academic little world. They're a lot like your father in that way, Stuart. The only reason I'm even at this school is so I'll turn out the way they want me to. God forbid I should be different. That isn't fair, Kipp, and you know it. It's you, you don't even try to understand them. Oh, Jesus Christ, Allister. How would you even know? You're their god damn answer to a prayer. Straight A's, straight head, you're as cute as a god damn button. You are so perfect for them to show off for their Cornell colleagues at faculty cocktail parties. You're their perfect little angel. You're wrong, Kipp! You're wrong about them and you're wrong about the war. Those guys at Pearl Harbor were guys just like us... only they chose to be there. They're dead, Kipp, and I can't forget that, I can't turn my back on that. I'm not going to stay here, safe and protected, anymore. I'm going to go off and fight in that war with Tim. - Allister, no. - Allister, you're talking crazy. For the first time in my life, I'm making sense. Allister, you're too young. You can't go. I can get a fake birth certificate or something. Tim said a lot of guys would be doing it, right, Tim? Well, why not, Kipp? It's freedom of choice, right? It's democracy, right? It's his choice. Stay out of this, Tim. Allister, you listen to me, and you listen to me good. I am not about to let you end up in some hellhole with artillery shells exploding over your head, with people dying left and right, and you pissing in your pants and crying like a little baby. Bullshit! You're the little baby! I hate you! Allister, come back here! - I'll go get him. - No, no, he's my brother. I'll go get him. Oh, you're doing a good job at that. Don't start with me, Tim. You know, the kid came in to talk to me today. Asked me advice about this Bennington girl he likes. He said he couldn't even talk to you because he was afraid you were going to make fun of him, Kipp. He said that? I'll go. Oh. Hey, Kipp. Hey, Billy. I'm sorry I woke you up. Is, uh... is Allister here? No, he never came in. I thought he was staying over with you again. Yeah, he was with me. Well, look, next time you see him, tell him I'm not going to cover for him in choir. - Goodnight, Billy. - Jenkins was pissed as hell. Getting much studying done? No, I can't study. I can't sleep. Thinking about your father? Look, if you're going to brush your teeth, just do it, but don't stand there and chew on that thing. It's very irritating. Truth. Are you having second thoughts about not going? I'm just a little confused right now, that's all. Come with me, Stuart. He'd be real proud of you. Who? My father. Your father? I only met him once. I've seen him at the swim meets a couple times, but... I never really thought he knew who I was. He knows who you are. In fact, he... even asks about you - whenever I speak to him. - What? See... my father swam for Green Mountain when he went here. He wanted me to. I didn't. It disappointed the hell out of him. Gosh, Stuart, I'm sure your father's very proud of you. How could he be? I'm not a leader. I'm not strong or brave or... or even decisive. All the things he is. Well, Stuart, you can't stay out of the war just because you're afraid you're going to disappoint your father... and on the other hand, you can't go just to try and prove something to him. You have to go because you feel it's right. Stuart... I want you there with me. Why? Because you can't get Kipp to go? No. Because I don't want to do this alone, Stuart. You know something, Mitchell? When I first met you, I thought you were, uh... a loudmouth braggart jock who lacked even an ounce of refinement. I know. You kept telling me. Yeah, but you became... You are... a good friend... But that's not why I'm coming with you. You're coming with me? I can't keep living my life to try to please my father, or not live it the way I want to because I'm afraid it won't please him. I mean, after all, it is my life. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to come with you. I think your father has a lot to be proud of in you. Yeah? Well, you're going to be the one to tell him I'm joining the Navy instead of the Army. * Silent night * Holy night * All is calm * All is bright * Round yon virgin * Mother and child * Holy infant * So tender and mild * Sleep in heavenly peace * Sleep in heavenly peace * That was pretty good. I didn't know that you could sing so well. It's hard to tell with your voice mixed in with everyone else. You just never listened. I looked everywhere for you. What are you doing in here, anyway? I missed practice, remember? No, seriously. Okay. I came here to pray. Oh? Do you pray a lot? Sometimes. How come you never talk about it? It's kind of a private thing. Were you afraid I'd laugh at you? Something like that. Do I do that a lot? Enough. Is that why you told Tim about your girlfriend instead of me? Because you thought I'd make fun of you? She's not my girlfriend. I mean, the girl from Bennington that you like. Yeah. I'm sorry, Allister. I'm really sorry. I don't ever want you to think that you can't tell me anything. I really want to go, Kipp. Can't you understand that? Mom and Dad aren't going to let you go. They have to sign for you because you're too young. No, but you can. I mean, you're 18. I can't sign for you. No, not sign. Go yourself, and I'll be you. I just need your birth certificate, and I know you have it. You keep it in your desk. Well, if you want to go so badly, why didn't you just take it? Because... maybe I wanted you to give it to me, you know? Say, "Goodbye, good luck, I'll write," just like at... at the end of one of those corny movies. I wanted to know if you cared. I care a lot about you, Allister. - That's why you're not going. - The hell I'm not! Don't you cuss in here. I'm going to go, with or without your help, and you can't stop me! Allister, wait! Listen to me, please. I can't let you do this! Well, it's my life, Kipp! [SWING BALLAD PLAYING] Do you have to do that now? In here? - It helps me relax. - No, music's relaxing. Chin-ups are exhausting. I guess nobody's really tired tonight, huh? Russell... Stuart's going to go with me. And now you've come over to convince me that I should come too. I saw your face when you heard about the guys at Pearl. I know you want to do the right thing. Stuart said in the dining hall that he wasn't afraid to die. Well, I am. I am afraid to die. I'll bet that, uh... Captain America or Submariner have... - Sub-Mariner. - Yeah, right. Well, I bet they've all been scared at one time or another. They're just comic books, Tim. That's the first time I've ever heard you say that. Yeah? Well, maybe it's the first time I've ever felt like saying it. Kipp, did you find Allister? Yeah... for a minute, anyway. Can I talk to you a second? Don't worry, Stuart, he'll be back. No, it's not that. What is it? I just wanted to tell you before you heard from somebody else. I've decided to go. I'm going to join the Navy with Tim. I'm going to be on that bus tomorrow. I just got off the telephone to tell my father that I'd be home early and why, and, boy, this time, I really did get him out of bed. - You're going to do it. - That's what I said. If Tim Mitchell told you to jump off the roof, would you do it? No, look, that's not it at all. I'm going because this is what I want to do. I don't have a duty to Tim or to my father or to even you. I have a duty to this country. I feel good about this. You should be happy for me, Kipp. I can't be. - TIM: Hey, Stuart. - STUART: Hey. Did you talk to him? - Yeah, we talked. - What did he say? He wasn't exactly jumping up and down about it. I'm getting ready to head out. I'll stay at the bus station, catch the first one in the morning. Tim... I want you to have this. Read it if for no other reason than I'm asking you to. Looks like pretty heady stuff. Yeah, you could say that. - No, thanks. - Tim, please. Look, the time for debating the good and bad of the war is over. An ocean on either side of us couldn't keep us out of this. We can't just bury our head in the sand or in some book, Kipp. - It's time to fight. - [STUART CLEARS THROAT] - Kipp? - Yeah? I'm going to get cleaned up and get ready for bed. Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, Stuart. Am I asking for that much, Tim? Huh? - A little understanding? - Poor Kipp. He's so abandoned and misunderstood. Yeah, well, what about me, huh? The way you make me out, I'm just after Jap blood, out to fight regardless what it's all about. That's the way you tried to make Russell and Stuart see it. Some friend. Why do you refuse to accept the fact that I'm not going, Tim? Do you really think that I'm chicken shit? Look me in the eye and tell me that you think I'm chicken shit. I think you're chicken shit! Well, I guess I know where we stand, then. Yeah, well, I've still got to clean out my locker. Yeah, why don't you stay here and finish this, if you're so gosh darn brave? Because there's nothing more to say. The hell there isn't! You know something, Kipp? I hoped that when we got on that bus tomorrow that we'd still be friends, but you're making that really hard. Fine, Tim. Go, then. Go and clean out your locker. But you better pack it all the way, because you might never be needing it again. No, I'll swim again when I get back! Maybe here at Green Mountain, maybe at some college, Kipp. Hey, I'm having my best season ever. The season just ended for you, Tim. Have you ever tried to swim with just one leg? One shell and it's all over. No patch up. They just cut it off. What the hell do you know about it, anyway? Amputation, Tim. It's one of those wondrous time savers of war medicine, or what about both of your legs, both gone? Then what? Oh, no big deal either, because you'd still have your big, tough arms to push you around in your wheelchair. You could sit in a bar and arm wrestle for drinks and tell glorious war stories. All right, that's enough, Kipp! Oh, what's wrong, tough guy? You afraid to hear what really goes on? Just shut up before I have to shut you up, Kipp. Then why don't you do it, then, if you're man enough? Come on! Get up! You want to fight? I'll fight you. Nice shot. I thought I heard a fist connect, and I figured you were on the end of it. I never got in a fight with Tim before. Well, he's your best friend, Kipp. All that best friend shit's for grade school kids. [ALLISTER GROANS] Hey, Allister. Wake up. Five more minutes, please. It's so early. No, come on, get up. Come on. Here. I'm just going to take you upstairs, okay? Come on, let's go. You still planning on leaving tonight? I don't think that I can. There's something else I got to do. Kipp, I'm sorry I ran out on you. You've just got to see that I'm not a kid anymore. I guess I'm finding that out. I guess so. Hey, Allister. How long have you been up? Since Kipp brought you in. You know, until yesterday morning, I had never even heard of Pearl Harbor. My biggest headache was Chemistry finals. That seems so long ago. Yeah. Are you scared of going, Allister? I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't, but, don't tell Tim, all right? Don't worry, I won't. You know, I've always thought that I would do something special with my life, something important, something that mattered, and if this is it, and being scared's what's keeping me from going... You want to go, don't you? I do. - I think I have to. - Come with us. I'm still going to be scared. We'll be scared together. I mean... - that'll be less scary. - Yeah, I think so. - Thanks, Allister. - Sure. Goodnight, Allister. Goodnight. [STARTING GUN FIRES] Come on, Tim! Come on, let's go! Come on! - Come on, Tim. - Push it! Come on! You've got it, you've got it! Go! Go! Whoo! All right, Mitchell! - You're winning! - Go! Go! Go! Tim! You can do it, Tim! Go! Go! Yeah! All right, Tim! [CLAPPING] I didn't come here to... argue or to preach or to fight or anything. I tried all those things and they didn't work. I've been thinking... Why don't you just go away, Kipp? You're not going to be able to hold your breath long enough to get rid of me. Will you just listen to what I have to say? In all the things... that we argued and yelled about tonight... I missed the most important thing. Even though I think you're wrong about this war, you're still my friend, and that's more important than anything. I thought you were leaving, Kipp. You know that when I came to this school I didn't make friends very easily. I was just that kid who smoked and got in fights all the time, until the day you came and sat down next to me and asked me my name. You've always been someone that I could talk to... and who'll listen to me. And I still am listening. At least, I'm trying to. If that's what a friend is, then I never had one before I met you. When you told me you were going off to fight in the war tonight, I got scared, Tim. It scares me to think that you might die and never come back. Well, how do you think I felt... when you told me that you weren't going? I mean... we've done everything together, Kipp, and now you're bailing out on me. I was mad as hell at you. But this war isn't my fight. Not right now. I can't go halfway around the world and fight for democracy when I have my own fight right here. Thurston is not going to shut me up as easily as he thinks. I'm going to stay here and fight my expulsion. Knowing you, Thurston's in for a hell of a fight. Friends? Always. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too, Kipp. Come on, let's get back to the dorm. What? What? Oh, no, you don't! Hey, where are you? Get up here! Oh-ho, I'm going to kill you! Grow up, will you? I can't believe you did this. Enough! [BELL TOLLS] All right, choir, gather around. Let's get together, boys. Now, where's Allister gone? In the key of G. * Hail to thee * O Green Mountain * Loyalty we pledge to you Let's go! Seniors! Over here! RADIO ANNOUNCER: Recruiting stations in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard are said to be receiving applicants in numbers unprecedented in the history of the nation. The pressure today is particularly strong at the Navy offices in the Federal Building at 90 Church Street, where thousands of men, some only youngsters, are attempting to join the service. At the outset, Navy officials estimate that 2,000 men have applied for naval service in the past 24 hours, and there are an estimated 1,500 standing in line this morning. On the West Coast, two formations of planes described as undoubtedly enemy flew over the San Francisco Bay area last night. The announcement was made by Brigadier General William Wells from the Fourth Interceptor Command. Official word from the White House confirms that one battleship has capsized at Pearl Harbor. No further information as to the severity of the damage... [CHEERING] Big smiles, guys. This one's for the yearbook. Hi, Kipp. Allister. What are you doing up here? I thought you were going to be on the bus. I'm going to get on at the last minute while Tim distracts Thurston. Oh. I came here to say goodbye and give you this. It's a letter to Mom and Dad. Here. It explains. You can read it. It's not private or anything. I'm going to go home with Tim and ship out with him. The Navy. - I'm going to join the Navy. - Yeah, I had that figured. The second I know what's going on, I'll give Mom and Dad a call. Okay, I'll tell them. Stay close to Tim, will you? - He's a good guy, Allister. - He'll look out for you. - I will. - I'm serious. I want you to come back from this. Me too. Here. It's my birth certificate. It'll make things a hell of a lot easier for you when you get to the recruiting office. Just talk a little deeper and... stand on your toes when you come to the front of the line. I know that I haven't been... very good at all the big brother stuff. I know I don't say it very often, Allister. I love you, Allie. I love you too. I really do. I'm going to miss you something awful. Yeah, I know. Me, too. [BUS STARTS] I got... I got to go. Take care of yourself, Allister. I will. I'll be seeing you. Yeah. Son, you should feel good today. We're very proud of you. Okay, okay. I'll do it, I'll do it. Better run quick, Billy. - Hey, you made it! - Yeah. Give 'em hell, Mitchell. Kick some ass over there, Mitchell. KIPP: December 9th, 1941. Dear Mom and Dad... Enclosed you will find a letter from Allister. He left today with a bunch of guys to enlist in the Navy. It was something he felt he needed to do, so I let him. I may soon have to follow him if I'm drafted, but for now I'll stay here. I have another fight of my own. I have been expelled from Green Mountain by Headmaster Thurston. I plan to appeal. He has no serious grounds for what he did, and I feel confident that I will be able to remain here. [CHEERING] Looking forward to Christmas with the both of you. Love, Kipp. [**]
