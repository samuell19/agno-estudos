- Let me just do a quick sync. - Yeah. - Cool, good. - Meet Max Fronenberg, my hero. That's me when I was five. You see, Max was kind of like my father growing up. He would take me out to eat all the time, made sure my brother and I lit the Hanukkah candles every year. He was there with a cake for every birthday. And just always gave me a lot of love. I never knew who he was though. You know, like his back story, until one day I sat him down and asked him. To my surprise, I probably unraveled one of the greatest stories ever told. So where did you grow up? - Growing up, we all hear about the great love stories. Romeo and Juliet, Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. This was no different. Stories of such unparalleled romance that they could only exist in fiction or be of some distant bygone time. What I could have never guessed though, was that a story as powerful and compelling as those could belong to my own grandfather. This story, like all great love stories, begins in the most unlikeliest of times in one of the darkest pages of history, the Holocaust. Germany, 1934. Adolf Hitler has brought an entire country to its knees underneath his Nazi regime, a political party rooted with basic tenants of violence and racism. Hitler unleashed scores of measures and legal mandates against the Jews, which stripped them of their money, jobs and basic human rights. These laws dehumanized the Jewish race entirely. So that I could better understand the world that this story takes place in, I decided to start my research at the Los Angeles Holocaust Museum. As I walked the halls, pored through archival footage, diaries and letters, I felt numb. A state of total shock. I'd grown up knowing about the holocaust, but never fully wrapped my mind around the atrocities that took place, until now. - I was at school, some kids were antisemitic. I remember one time I was going home and they had to be in packs, four or five of them, y'know? And then, oh there's a Jew, and then they would try and run after me and try and beat me up. But I run fast. - Nazi propaganda created wide-spread antisemitism as people were attacked and beaten on the streets, homes, businesses, and synagogues were set to fire. Under Hitler grew the ugly sentiment that Jews were a disease of which there could only be one cure, extermination. - The ghetto was a sectioned-off area of Warsaw with the specific purpose of storing the remaining Jews, only to be slowly distributed out to concentration camps. - Liquidation was when the Nazi's would expel all Jews from the ghetto, shipping them to concentration camps on cattle trains. - At first people could only speculate as to what was happening. They thought the liquidation was merely a transferring from one ghetto to another. - They were instructed to remove all clothing for what was to be a group shower, then pack upwards of 2,500 people into a room fit for 500, close the doors and bolt them shut. Gas would pour in from metal cylinders in the ceiling filling the chamber with poisonous fumes, and killing all who were inside. They were not soldiers, combatants, nor enemies of the state. They were teachers, doctors, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, people. Executed for a reason no more complex than one, they were Jewish. You can still see the scratch marks on the walls as they clawed for one last breath. - The Nazis would sometimes take entire families out of their homes and onto the road for a more public display of terror. Each member of the family would be ordered to their knees and executed, one by one with a bullet straight to the back of their heads. There was no mercy or question at all. Amongst the Nazis was a strong sense of satisfaction when killing a Jew. For them, it was a feeling of great pride, as they believed it was for the betterment of their future nation. No one was spared. You see this was an execution of a vermin species that needed to be annihilated at any cost. It was the first phase in their master plan to cleanse the earth of the Jewish people so that they no longer could infect the rest of the general population. Why would they execute them? - When the war broke out, many Jewish people were able to conceal their identities to prevent from being murdered. - Rena was taken to Pawiak as a political prisoner. - Initially, while researching Max's story, I thought that Max and Rena were the only survivors of Pawiak alive and able to fill in the details, however the more I researched, the more I discovered. While on a trip to Israel, I tracked down a man by the name of Josef Atlasowicz. Josef was also a survivor of Pawiak and was there with Max and Rena in the prison. After hearing Josef's incredible story, I found a camera crew in Israel so we could sit down with Josef and do a formal interview. - My name is Josef Atlasowicz. - Most Jews captured had valuable skills that the Nazis could use as free labor workers in the camps. - Some would lie, knowing that certain skill-sets were highly desirable to the Nazis. - A Jew of little to no use for the Nazis would suffer one of two fates. Immediate execution or the gas chambers. - After doing some more research into the other names that Max mentioned from Pawiak, I discovered the final missing piece to this puzzle. A man by the name of Barry Newman, still alive and living in Miami. I booked the first plane out to meet him. - It's on, it's rolling. That's it, okay, so maybe we'll with. - What? - When was the first time that you met Max? - These groups consisted of people who were either political prisoners, found guilty of treason, or prison workers who were no longer of use. - I couldn't imaging what it must have been like to witness such horrific things day after day, year after year at the young age of just 20 years old. - Max had thought about escaping many times, yet believed that even if he was successful that there was absolutely nowhere to go. - So he did what he was told and drove the truck back and forth every day. Unknowingly, this helped Max build a relationship with one of the guards that would end up being a vital part to his future plans for escape. - With his father working outside most days, I wondered why he wouldn't just chance trying to run away when the guards weren't watching. Surely they couldn't keep a constant eye on every prisoner, could they? But the reality of the situation wasn't so simple. And I saw the real question wasn't, why wouldn't he run, but where would he run to? - In the tailor shop, Rena would be less likely discovered as a Jew, and Max would be able to check up on her more often while doing small odd jobs for the guards. - Even though they only had a few moments together each day, their connection began to grow stronger for one another. - It didn't matter what your social class or success level was, if you were Jewish you were stripped of your rights and all of your belongings. - Max witnessed the man who he had respected for his wealth and social class fall into a miserable depression from not being able to cope with the environment he was thrown into. - Max finally realized that regardless of anything, eventually he might see the same fate someday and it was time to find a way out. - Capitalizing on the relationship with the guard whom he had driven with every morning, Max convinced him that there was mold in the basement where they were working and that it needed to be sealed off to prevent them from getting sick. - Max again was able to use his relationship to help convince the guards that Karolczik had actually gone crazy and was rolling around in the dirt outside for no reason at all. - They had no idea where to go or how to hide. Walking for miles from town to town searching for somewhere they could stay for a few nights and be safe. Max had a contact with someone from the Jewish underground who gave him an address and told him a code word to use at the door to gain entry. - Just one year later, this nightmare eventually ended in 1945 when the Americans and Russians defeated the Nazi troops, liberating the Jews from these prisons and camps. By this time, 6 million Jews had been killed and the history of the human race had been changed forever. Max had assumed that Rena died in Pawiak, and although he felt the pain and sorrow of losing her, he had at his point become all too familiar with death and accepted it as the norm for people who he loved in his life. - Luckily he was able to reconnect with his father after joining the same Jewish rights group after returning to Warsaw. - He figured it was only a matter of time before they found out he was under a fake name. - After Max's disappearance, Rena's father married her off to another man. - Max and Halina had an entire life together. They bought a home, raised their kids together in Montreal, Canada. Their son Louie went on to become a doctor, and their daughter Iris a designer. He started his own successful metal manufacturing company. They were very much in love with each other and led a beautiful life together. - Max still goes to Halina's grave every year since she passed to visit and pay his respects. He says sometimes he can feel her presence, and knows that she's always looking out for him. Although I never had a chance to get to know Halina personally, I'd like to think that she was there that day with us while filming. You wanna take off? Okay, yeah, let's go. Movie camera, yeah. - My grandfather's story has taught me that true love does exist and that fate is real. If two people are meant to be, then regardless of anything, somehow, someway their spirits will connect. These two have shown me the true meaning of love and how beautiful it can be. There's a famous quote that I think sums up what Max and Rena have in each other, and what I hope we all will find in someone along the way. A soul mate is someone we feel profoundly connected as though the communicating and communing that takes place between us were not the product of intentional efforts, but rather of divine grace. - Careful, careful. - These are my grandparents, Max and Rena Fronenberg.
