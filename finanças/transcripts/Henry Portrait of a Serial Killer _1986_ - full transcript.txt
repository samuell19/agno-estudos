Yeah. You look terrible. Okay, come on let's go. It's this way. Before you got married I told you Leroy was no damn good. That he was trash and he'd always be trash and you was going to catch it and you did didn't you? I don't really want to talk about him right now. Okay by me, we don't have to talk about it now. We don't have to talk about it ever. How long are you going to be up here? It's hard to say. What about Lurleen? How long can you leave her with mama? I don't know. I'm going to get a job, make some money. Maybe bring her up here, I don't know. Where did you tell Leroy you were going? I don't want to talk about him. Okay, we don't have to talk about him! You hungry? Yeah. Good, I'm hungry too. You think Leroy's hungry? Do you want some more coffee? Yeah, thanks. Here. So what kind of work do you planning on getting up here? Anything like... I haven't decided yet. What else can you do besides dance naked? Don't start with me Otis. I can do lots of things mister. Oh yea, like what? Like waitressing or a beautician. Yeah. After seeing you I might just try brain surgery. You're a card. Yeah, I'm the queen. Yeah, the queen of clubs. Don't make me sorry I came here, Otis. Howdy. Hey, Henry. I brought you a present. Where did you get that? Picked it up. Pretty nice? Sure is a beauty. Henry this here is my sister, Becky. She's gonna be staying here with us for a while like I said. Becky this here's Henry. Hello Henry. Hello Becky. Good to meet you. She don't look nothing like you, that's for sure. Lucky for her. Henry's on his way out west. Oh, where? California. She can sleep on the couch. No, no. Listen Becky I want you to take the spare room. No, Henry, thank you but no... I insist. Ain't that right Otis? Up to you. Alright, but if it gets to be a bother, we'll change. Fair enough. Well, I got to get going. I got some work to do today. I just stopped by to clean up a little. Where you working? I'm helping Andy spray some houses off La Grange. So that's working out for you? Yeah. Sounds like fun. Coffee? No thanks, I gotta go. See ya. Yeah. That's it till next week. I was hoping for a little more work. So was I. You never know. Sometimes I get a call. You know, these assholes want you to be out there the next day. You never know. Yeah. Here, take this. We'll call it a retainer. Thanks. You don't here from me give me a call. Hold on. Don't forget your sprayer. Hang onto it. Okay. Come on, kid, come on. Throw it in there. Good catch. Put a spiral on it. Nice catch. Sorry about that. It's good. And please check the left rear tire. It's good, too. Thank you. Yeah. And what can I do for you, sir. You got any more of what you had last week? I might. Well do you, or don't you? Yeah. Well? Well, I don't have it on me, stupid. Give me the money. I'll bring it around the field. I don't want you hanging around practice. Give me my money back. UP to you. Be in the parking lot at 6:30. Sure thing. 6:30 tomorrow. Tomorrow? Take it or leave it. Great. See ya. Fuckin' pervert. Oh, it's so gross. I always did hate doing this. I'll do it. That's alright. Where did you say you met him? Who? You know who, Henry. What do you want to know for? I don't know. I'm just curious. Van Dalia. Van Dalia? Sure, Van Dalia. What was he in for? You don't want to know. What did he do, kill his mama? Come on, what was he in for? You don't want to know. What did he do, rob a bank or something? You were right the first time. You were right the first time. He killed his mama. Don't you ever tell him I told you. You're kidding me? No, I ain't. Yes you are. Alright, I'm kidding you. Just don't ever tell him I told you. He killed his mama? With a baseball bat. Her and one of her boyfriends. I swear if you ever tell him I told you I'll beat your ass right off. How do you know all this? He told me, that's how I know. How else would I know? Were you cellmates or something? No, we were friends. When did he get out? A couple of years before me. Hi. I got some business I got to take care of. You going out? Yeah, for a while, I got to run an errand for a fellow. You want to come along Henry? No, you go ahead. Okay. See you later. Want to play cards? What was your daddy like? My daddy? He used to drive a truck before he got his legs cut off. I remember one time, he brought me and my little brother home bicycles. He had delivered some that day and he had a couple left over. But, mine was way too big for me, and my brother he couldn't ride his anyway. Daddy, he said I'd grow into it, but, I never did. Why not? I never got the chance, they sold it. They sold them both. So you have a brother? My brother, he had a bone disorder. He was a little deformed. What happened to him? He died. I can't ever remember really liking my daddy. I wanted to, I really did. One time he bought me, when I was about five, he bought me an ice cream cone and I dropped it. And he slapped me and made me pick it up and eat it. I never liked my daddy. One time, when my momma was at work, and I was about 13, he come into my room and he told me to take my shirt off 'cause he wanted to see how I was developed. And when I wouldn't he got real mad and he hit me. And he told me he had a right because he was my daddy and I was his daughter and he fed me and let me live in his house and he could do whatever he wanted. And he did. Then he started coming into my room a lot, after that. And I didn't fight him because when I did he just hit me. I was afraid I was going to have a baby and that my baby would be deformed but, I never got pregnant. I tried to tell mama, but she didn't want to hear about it. She pretended not to believe me but I knew she did. It sure is good to talk... to talk to you Henry, because I know you're not judgmental or anything like that. I never would have married Leroy in the first place if I hadn't wanted to get away from daddy so bad. Didn't get along with your daddy? Did you really kill your mama? What? Did you really kill your mama? I guess I did. How did it happen? I stabbed her. Otis said you hit her with a baseball bat. Otis said that? Yeah. Well, he's mistaken. Well, don't tell him I told you, he made me promise. She must have treated you real bad. She was a whore. My mama was a whore. But I don't fault her for that. It ain't what she done it's how she done it. As long as I can remember she'd be bringing men up to the house. My daddy was there too but it didn't matter none to her. She'd make me watch it. That's creepy. She beat me too, a lot. She beat me when I wouldn't watch it. And sometime she'd beat me make me wear a dress and watch her doing it. And then they'd laugh at me. She made you wear a dress? You think I'm lying? I feel like I know you. Like I've known you for a long time. I feel like I've known you for ever and ever. Yeah... I killed my mama... One night, It was my 14th birthday and she was drunk and, we had an argument. She hit me with a whiskey bottle. And I shot her. I shot her dead. I thought you said you stabbed her? Oh yeah. That's right. I stabbed her. Hey. Anything good on TV? I got a job today. Oh yeah? Doing what? At a beauty parlor. A beauty parlor? I'm a shampoo girl. What's that? What's it sound like, you dummy? How the hell should I know? You ever seen me in a beauty parlor? I give shampoos, a woman gets her hair shampooed before she gets it cut and I do it. They pay you for that? Of course they do. Besides I used to do it some back home after I met Leroy. Do you like it better than dancing naked? Don't start with me Otis. You used to dance naked? Sure, all the time around the house. Otis. Best little naked dancer you ever saw. You never. Were you really a dancer? I danced some, in a club, and I wasn't naked. I wore a costume. But I guess it wasn't very much. When you gonna dance for us? When the pope pees in his hat, Otis. Ain't she got a mouth on her? I better have something on me to defend me from a pig like you. Otis. Them's pretty earrings you got on Becky. Thank you Henry. At least there's one gentleman at this table. Oh, I'm sorry honey, now don't get mad. I was just having a little fun with you, that's all. Oh, wait. I got something to show you. What? Wait. Nice. Real nice. Put it on. Right now? Okay, but turn around first. Turn around. Okay, you can look. What does it say on there? I love Chicago. Looks good, don't it Otis? Oh, hey honey, Why don't you bring me a beer, this one's empty. I ain't your maid, get it yourself. Oh, now come on honey, I ain't asking you to wash the windows or nothing, I just want a beer. Come on, bring your poor old brother a beer, will ya? Don't do that Otis, she's your sister! Okay, I was only kidding around, Henry. Tell her you're sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. Now, tell her you won't do it again. I won't. I swear Becky I swear, I won't. Ouch! Shit, Henry! Serves you right. Thank you, Henry. That's alright. Listen, I'll do the dishes. I don't mind. I don't. Listen, why don't you boys go out and get a beer. I'll do these, I don't mind, honest. Well, what do you say Otis? You want to go grab a beer? Sure, I don't mind. I'll just go spruce up. That was a real nice supper, Becky. Thanks. Have fun. Yeah. Easy. Easy. Oh, come on, slow down! Easy tiger, easy! Slow down. Now, wait a minute! Hey come on, I'm not kidding! Suzie? Suzie! Suzie... Otis! Come here, I'll drive. What's gonna happen when they find those bodies? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Just what I said Otis, nothing. Nothing's gonna happen cause nothing happened. And I don't know nothing about it whatever it is. Do you? Hey, I don't know nothing. Good. Oh, fuck. Feeling better? Yeah. You want some fries? You telling me you never killed anybody before? I ain't saying that. Then you've killed before, right? Well, maybe I didn't have no choice. You didn't have no choice here neither. Did you? Did you? I don't know, it ain't the same. It's always the same, and it's always different. What do you mean? It's either you or them, one way or the other. Ain't that right? Open your eyes, Otis. Look at the world. It's either you or them. You know what I mean. Yeah. Good. You want a beer? Okay. There was only one left. He knows nothing about this but you can bet a dollar to a doughnut that when he finds out, and he will find out 'cause I'll tell him there'll be hell to pay. Really. I'll never go back there again I can tell you that. Not when he's not there anyway. First of all there ain't two of them that speaks English. It's gone down so badly the way it's changed it breaks my heart. It's like that all over. People spit at you. I wish I was lying. Yeah, you can't have a regular good time in the city no more. Shit! Fuck. What did you do that for? I guess I got carried away. Well, I guess you did, Otis. Shit, I got to have a TV. Well, let's go shopping. So what can I do for you gentlemen? It's hot in here, isn't it? I'm kind of cold. We want a TV. How much you got to spend? What do you got? 50 bucks. I can let you have the set over there for 50 bucks. Well, turn it on we want to see if it works. What's the matter, don't you trust me? Here plug it in down there. Here? Yeah, down there, real good. I see you've had some college. Like you can see it works real good. Just takes a while to warm up. It's black and white! Of course it's black and white. What do you expect for 50 bucks? Fuckin' 3-D for Christ sake. Well, how much is color? We want color. You can't get color for 50 dollars. That's okay, let's see what you got. What have I got? You want cable ready? You want remote control? You want UHF? You want 13"? You want 19"? I bet you'd like to have a 19". You want Sony? You want Zenith? You want a Gold Star? What can we get for a $150? I can let you have this set for $150. It's worth $300. But here, take a look at this. For an extra $75, you can take this $600 set. What's this? It's a camcorder. What? It's a videotape recorder and camera rolled into one. You just pop in a cassette and you're ready to go. You can make your own movies with that? What else would you do with it? How much you want for it? It's worth a grand, I'd take half. 500 bucks? Yeah, half of a grand is $500. That's a little more than we were planning to spend. I think we should just take the TV. Okay, which one do you want? The $50 one. You guys come in here, I show this, I show you that, and you creeps got a lousy $50 to spend. You should have stopped me a long time ago. Take the $50 set and get the hell out, I'm a busy man. Well, we were really counting on a color set. What's the matter, You got shit in your ears? The black and white is $50, take it or leave it. Sorry we wasted your time, come on, Otis. Don't give me sorry, you dumb ass! Did I stutter? Gimme the $50 and get out! I'll give you 50... No! Otis, Plug it in. Oh get out of here you're so ugly. Lurleen, here's your Uncle Otis. Hi Lurleen, hi honey, how are you, hi it's Uncle Otis. Henry come dance with me. Come on, come on, just dance. Who me? Yeah. No, no, no. Come on Henry. Come on do it Henry. All right lets go. That's it. Get down. Wig it as they say here. More, more, come on, go for it... come on Henry, that's it, that's it... Work them hands, Henry. That's it, that's it. Lo and behold, what a guy. Come on, come on, see look how good it is. Right there yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, more, more! More! More damn it! Fight your own battles. Get this... Turn it off! Turn it off! I want more, just a little bit more. All right. That's it, that's it, just a little bit, all right that's it. Hi baby. Come on Henry, say hi. No. Say hi, Henry. No more, Otis. Say hi, Henry. No more, Otis! He doesn't want to. Say hi baby. I said hi. Yeah? Look I'll do the best I can, but I don't promise... Fuck him. Yeah, yeah, good-bye. Crazy guy! What? Some jerk off hasn't been out of jail six months, gets drunk, gets busted up in a fight. So he goes home and gets a gun and comes back later and shoots the guy. They find the gun on him. He claims he was framed. What are you going to do? So, everything going okay? Yeah. Okay, You still working at Bobs Gas? Yes sir. Good, you working everyday? Two, three days a week. It's a little slow now. Well, if it's less than two days a week let me know. We'll see what we can do for you. You still living at 1801 West North? Yes sir. Good. I got to cut it short today, Otis. My kid's scheduled for oral surgery. I promised to take him over. Sure. Good, I'll see you next month. Take it easy. Bye. You got it? Got what? You know what. Here you go. You wanna try it? God damn, you son of a bitch! Fuckin'...! Damn it! Fucker. Let me see that. That little fuckin' bastard. I ought to kill him. I ought to cut his fuckin' head off. That'd be a mistake. Look who's talking. Watch your mouth Otis. I'm sorry, Henry. You kill that high school boy they're going to slap your ass right back in jail. Otis that's a promise. People have seen you together. I'd still like to kill him though. I bet you would. I'd like to kill somebody. Say that again. I'd like to kill somebody. Let's me and you go for a ride Otis. Here, I want to show you something. Where'd you get this? Careful Otis, it's loaded. Where'd you get it? Guns are easy to get. I can make a phone call and get a gun. Anybody can get a gun Otis. What do you got in mind Henry? What do you think? I don't know. Put up the hood. Why? Just put up the hood, Otis. You guys need any help? Otis, do you need some help, or can you do it yourself? Feel better? Yeah. Alright. If you shoot somebody in the head with a 45 every time you kill somebody it becomes like your fingerprint see. But if you strangle one and stab another, one you cut up one you don't then the police don't know what to do. They think you're four different people. What they really like, what makes their job so much easier, a pattern. What they call a modus operandi. That's Latin. Bet you didn't know any Latin, did ya? Big fuckin' deal. What? Nothing. It's like a trail of shit, Otis. It's like a blood droppings from a deer you've shot and all they gotta do is follow those droppings and pretty soon they're going to find that deer. Why do we use a gun? You can use a gun. I'm not saying you can't use a gun. Just don't use the same gun twice. The most important thing is to keep moving. That way they might never catch up to you. I'm gonna have to pack up and be on the move too, pretty soon. Where are you going? Nowhere. You wanna come? We could be back this way in about a month. I'm not supposed to leave the state without telling them. So who's gonna know? As long as you show up when you're supposed to? What if they check up on me at work? Well, no plan is perfect. Bring her in. Bring her in Otis. Come on. That's it. Yeah, yeah. Sit down. Sit her down. Oh, good, good, good, good, good. Take her blouse off. Take it off. Oh yeah, Otis, good. My oh, yeah, yeah. Skirt, skirt, skirt. Do it Otis, you're a star. Shut up! I'll do what the hell I want to do bitch! Leave me alone! Do it Otis. Do it. Henry look. You got it. Go for it boy. Shut up! Get the fuckin' kid! Son of a bitch! Henry, look! Hey Henry? Henry? What? Hi! Looky here, where you at. Bye! Where you at? Say hello, honey! I have to wave to my baby. Henry, bye. Henry, look at this, Henry. Ain't that a view. Otis! No, Otis! Otis! No! Let's go! What are you doing? I want to see it again. In jail? Are you sure? Is Lurleen there? Does she know? In the what, in the army? Go get her, will you? Hi. Hi, hi. Do you miss me? I miss you. You did? That's wonderful. Are you being a good girl? I don't think so honey. I know I promised, but... a couple of things have happened here. I know, he is a good soldier. Soon, real soon, I promise. I love you, too. Yeah, put your grandma back on, okay? Hi. I know. I'll think about it. I can't right now. I will, soon. I can't talk now okay, I gotta go. Okay. Bye. Great, great. I got one, I got one, here, look. Oh, look, look, look, look, look. Look at this, look at this. Tight on there. Yeah, no, no, no, oh, no, I like this one better. Look Henry, Henry look. Oh, yeah, I love it, I love her. Oh god, how she looks, isn't she pretty. God, look at that dress, look at the way it moves. Oh yeah! Pull up next to her, real slow. Look what you did! Oh God! Oh Jesus! Look at it, it's ruined. Damn Henry you ought to look where you're driving. Who the hell told you to stick your head out the window anyway? You could have killed me! Oh, that's right. Blame it on me! Oh, this fucking camera! What did you do that for? It wasn't any good anymore. Could have fixed it. Shit, the lens was busted right off! Could have fixed it! How do you know, you a camera repair man. You should have said something. You didn't give me a chance, Otis. You threw the fucker right out the window. It ain't my fault it broke. Oh right. Go back and get it if you want. Yeah. Want to get a beer? Not particularly. I want a beer. If you want a beer so bad, Otis, go ahead and get one. All right, I will. See you later. Yeah. I talked to Lurleen. Yeah? You'd like her. God, I miss her. I'm thinking, I might be heading on back home. I quit. You quit what? My job. What happened? Nothing. I just figured it was time to go home. You want to come with me? I thought you wanted to make some money? Yeah, but, I'm thinking, I don't want to bring Lurleen up here after all. You know, that was my intention. There's just too much going on up here. She'd get lost. We're better off living with mama. I can work back home, I won't make as much money I'm sure, but, I won't need as much either. And I can live with mama. You can stay there, too. You figure it's safe to go back? I hope so. Leroy's in jail for murder and his bond's a million dollars. So, unless he wins the lottery Leroy won't be going anywhere for quite a while. Where's Otis? He had a dinner date I think he said. Really? Well. Come with me? When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Better think fast Henry. You got your ticket? Not yet. But my mind's made up. Might as well just do it. Might as well. I'd rather ride with you. Let me think about it. I'll tell you what, let's me and you go get us a steak dinner, I'm buying. I got a new Visa card I want to try out. You've got a Visa card? Yeah, who you think you're associating with anyway? Great, let's go. Alright. Where are we going? We'll find a place. Grab your jacket and let's go. I gotta go to the bathroom. Okay. He's passed out. I ain't interrupting nothing, am I? You guys want a beer? You got any cigarettes? Not since Superman died. I gotta, go out and get some cigarettes, get some air. Henry? I'll be right back I promise, I just need some air. Henry. You want anything? Otis? How about getting your poor ol' brother a beer? Hi. Two packs of Kools. What kind? What? What kind? Milds, Regulars, 100's... Regulars. Two, sixty. Hey, how about those Bears? Fuck the Bears. Okay. Hi. That's a nice looking dog you got there. Thank you. What kind is it? Heinz. What? 57 varieties. What? It's a mutt, half Yorkshire, half Shitzu. Shitzu. What's his name? Delores. What? Her name is Delores. That's a nice name. Hear that Delores? Say thank you. We gotta go. Bye now. Come here, come here, come here. No! You god damn bitch. You son of a... Adios, mother fucker! Relax, take it easy. No, no, no, easy. Why don't you call the police? No, no, no. What about Otis? It's not a good idea. No. What are we going to do? Shut up, let me think! Shut up! Let me think! Let me think! You want to listen to the radio? Henry. That was so awful. I'm scared. What do we do now? We just got to keep moving, that's for sure. My sister owns a ranch outside San Bernardino. She raises horses there. She's got about 1/2 dozen of them. Arabians. They're beautiful. We can stay there as long as we want to. What about Lurleen? We'll send for her, soon as we get there. You promise? I promise. I love you Henry. I guess, I love you too. Where are we going to go now? We'll find a place. You want to listen to the radio? Okay. This is a nice guitar. I used to play a little. But, I'm out of practice. We better go to bed now.
