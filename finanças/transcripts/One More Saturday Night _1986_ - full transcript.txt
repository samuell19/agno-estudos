If I'm gonna stay any longer, I'll let you know. Say, aren't you Bill Cadwell's son? [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah. Hi, Mr. Strobel. I... I didn't know you worked here. I saw you throw those three touchdowns at homecoming, Russ. Oh, I get lucky, I guess. Uh, so, what you got going tonight, Russ? Gonna get lucky again? Uh, no... See, uh, we have relatives staying with us and, um... They're painting my room. Right. Sure... Painting. Here you go. Here? Mmm-hmm. SALLY: We're here, campers. Welcome to St. Cloud. That guy in Minneapolis did not fix the exhaust leak, it's as bad as it was before, if not worse. Yeah, but it's just what I needed to fall asleep. Well, next time we go on tour, I'm driving. Hey, next time you buy the van. [HOOTING] Horn scan, horn scan. Where? Where, where, where? Left. Oh, man, I'll tell ya, I've seen so many beautiful women since I got to Minnesota. That is because the state of Minnesota has got more blonde, luscious, genetically pure Swedish women than anyplace in the world. Except for Sweden. LARRY: You know why Scandinavian women are so beautiful? Because the Vikings were medieval bikers who rode around in these boats invading villages. They'd kill the man and take only the most beautiful women with them because there wasn't much room on those boats. I see, now we're getting Larry's historical pussy perspective. That's right. [HOOTING] No, no, no, they're kids. It's okay, they can watch. Right. Tonight, I'm gonna find me a blond Viking goddess to ravish. Hey, I can't help it. I'm a lesbian trapped inside a man's body. Hi, how you doing? Good, so far. Uh, Badmouth. I think they made reservations for us at the... Where's the... What's the bar? Cabooze BOTH: Cabooze. Gunther. Come here. Got some food. Come here, boy. Gunther. Here, boy. [DOG BARKING] [SHOUTS] God damn it! [DOG BARKING] [SHOUTS] Don't you know any better? You could give Gunther a heart attack. He's a full pedigree, you know! MAN: Animal abuse. That's what it is, animal abuse. [MAN CONTINUES SHOUTING] You feeble-minded dog abuser! [DOG BARKING] Karen, can I borrow your blue sweater? Sure, go ahead, it's yours. That's right, it is mine. What're you doing? Setting a trap. Kevin goes through our stuff when we're out. No! Yeah. You think he could've gone through my diary? Possible. Little creep. You watch when we come home tonight, that hair will be in a different spot. Kevin, would you knock, please? So, what are you and Russ doing tonight? Uh, we're going to a hockey game. And then what? Might get something to eat. And then what? Kevin, have you ever looked through any of my stuff? No, I just thought maybe you and Russ might be doing something special. It's Saturday night. I don't know. You little... [CHUCKLES] Oww! [SCREAMING] Hold still, it didn't go through yet. Ahhh, geez! Come on, hold still. Okay. Ow! [WINCES] That did the trick. Where's the earring? [PANTING] [WINCING] Okay, I'm splittin'. Thanks. What're you doing? Taking these albums, the shirt and shit. That's cool. [WINCES] So long. All right, son. Safe home. What? Oh, just one of Dougie's friends saying good-bye. Oh, that's nice. [DOUG CRYING OUT] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MR. LUNDAHL: Diane, can I come in? I gotta brush my teeth. Sure, Dad. You know, you already brushed your teeth? I'm gonna floss. Do we have any floss? [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Dad, I've never seen you like this. [LAUGHS] Honey, I haven't been on a date in 23 years. And that was with your mother. Feel like I'm back at high school again. Come on, Dad. You're a great guy. And whoever this woman is, I know she's nice if you've asked her out. All you gotta do is just give her half a chance to get to know you. You're right. Just be yourself, okay? Okay. Okay. I'm gonna try real hard to do that. Dad? Did you ever have sex with any ladies besides Mom? No. BILL: Yeah, yeah... LYNN: Yeah. Yes, Mommy and Daddy are going out. But we'll be back. Yeah. And you're gonna have a baby sitter for the first time. Won't that be fun? Yes. Say, "Yes, it will!" BILL: And Daddy's gonna go out to get something to eat and so is Mommy! [BABY COOING] And then we're gonna go out dancing. ♪ Staying alive, staying ♪ [LAUGHING] BILL: And when we come home, you're gonna be a little sleepy baby. [LAUGHING] And then we're gonna tiptoe into your room and we're gonna look at you. Yes, we will... Gonna look at you, poo-poo. Yes! [DOORBELL RINGING] Oh, but Daddy better get ready because the babysitter's here and we're gonna be late LYNN: Oh, but Daddy's always late, isn't he? Yeah. [LAUGHS] Don't talk to me through the child. Don't raise your voice around the baby. Otay, otay. But it really pisses Daddy off when you talk through the baby. [LAUGHS] Yeah. If you're talking to fucking Daddy, then talk to Daddy. Oh, let's wait till we get outside, shall we? Otay. Now Daddy's gonna go outside and start up the car. Which Mommy could have done herself, if she was so tremendously worried about the time. Yes! [BABY COOING] Daddy can be a bit of an asshole, can't he? Yeah. [BABY LAUGHING] [DOORBELL RINGING] Ah, Karen. Come on in. Hi. Thank you so much for sitting for us. Oh, no problem, Mr. Neal. Jason's a great baby. I like him a lot. Oh boy, I tell you, it's really a good thing that Lynn and I are getting a chance to go out by ourselves tonight. 'Cause I'm telling you we're starting to get on each other's nerves a little bit. Karen, this is the restaurant. Okay. This is the pediatrician. This is the hospital. This is the fire department. This is Bill's mother's number. Well, she lives in St. Paul, that probably won't do you much good. And this is my mother and she lives in Detroit. Well, you have them just in case. Just in case, it's a good policy. Okay, she's got it under control, honey. Let's go. Oh, I know. It's just that... Oh! If he start's to cry when you're changing his diaper, just put Teddy Bear Picnic on his record player. Okay, Teddy Bear Picnic. Okay, let's go! Oh, wait! I wanna say good bye just one more time. [SIGHS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Dougie, the front porch light is out, and your mom can't see the front steps. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] I want you to go out now and change the bulb. Come on, Dad. Do I have to? Yes, you do. Mrs. Hultquist broke her hip last week and your mom is afraid of losing her footing. Dougie, we don't ask you to do that much around the house. Now, there's a new bulb with the groceries in the back seat of the car. I'd have brought them in but my back's been bothering me. Yeah, yeah, your back, I know. Just give me the keys. [SIGHS LOUDLY] [SIGHS] [CHANGING RADIO STATIONS] [HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECH] [WOMAN TALKING ON TV] [EXCLAIMS] Pearl, Pearl, wake up. Wake up! What? Shh! Hello, police? Yes, someone stole my car and kidnapped my son. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, if it isn't God's gift to babysitters! Wait, my mouth is caught in a magnetic force field. Oh, no. Hey, cool it, Eddie! Okay. All right, where's the kitchen, I have to stash these brews. That way, I'm gonna go check on the baby. All right, Smokey Robinson! Hey, are these people black? Would you be quiet? We got a baby in here. Yeah, all right. [BABY COOING] Here's your little pal. Yeah. Like him a lot, huh? [RHYTHM & BLUES MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [BABY CRYING] [MUSIC STOPS] Whoops! Kevin, please don't throw the football in the living room. What're you talking about? We always throw the football. You know when Mom was alive the football wasn't even allowed in the house. Well, she's dead. Kevin! I'm sorry, but she is. Dad, will you tell the worm here not to throw the football in the living room. Okay. One toss. Hey, a compromise. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hey, kiddo. Hi. MR. LUNDAHL: Hey, Russ. How's the arm? Ah, couldn't be better, Mr. Lundahl. So what you kids up to tonight? Oh, well, we're just gonna go to the hockey game then hang out with some friends, I guess. And then what? And then, uh... Hey, I just might pass the ball to my top wide receiver. Lundahl making a defense. It was quite horrible. MR. LUNDAHL: Hut 23, 24. Hut, hut, hike! Better stand back, can't find the receiver. Ledge to Cadwell. Look at the ball there, touchdown! What a catch, Bob! The crowd can't believe it, neither can I, Bob. It's been the greatest play of all time. Hey, I got us the room. Okay. Well, I thought I'd spare you the embarrassment. That's very romantic. [LAUGHS] Hey, come on. It was your idea. Wait, it was my idea not to do it in the backseat of the car. Okay, okay, now. Come on, now. This is a big night for us, okay? Now, it's a nice room and the mayor's gonna be there and he's gonna cut the ribbon. I don't think that's very funny. I'm not kidding. He's gonna be there with a band, a photographer, the giant pair of scissors... Ha-ha! Gee, Dad, you must be pretty hard-up if you're asking me. I uh... I am. I'm 11 years old. All I know is what I've seen on TV and movies. Yeah. Well... You should be wearing tighter pants, I think. [HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [MUSIC CONTINUES] TRACI'S DAD: Who's that? TRACI: Doug! TRACI'S MOM: You didn't tell us you were going out. TRACI'S DAD: You are not going out. Yes, I am. Just a minute. How could a boy in Traci's class have a driver's license? TRACI'S DAD: Maybe he was left back a year. He's not the brightest boy in the world. Doesn't even have enough sense to come in and say hello. How difficult can that be? [MUSIC CONTINUES] Don't like that boy. I don't like him. I don't like his attitude. Honey, I'm telling you, we're doing the smartest thing. She's going through a phase. Let's just ride it out. TRACI: Bye, I'll see you later. Hey. Hey, Doug. Where did you get the car? Stole it. This is your dad's car, isn't it? So? I stole it from my dad. [CHUCKLES] But Doug, that's not stealing a car. Listen, Traci, this is hardly the first thing I've stolen. Oh, come on! You've never stolen anything in your life and you know it. You don't know everything there is to know about me, okay? Really? Like what? Like, I've been involved in some larceny. [TURNS RADIO OFF] Like what? Like, stripping buildings, stealing equipment from construction sites. You know, breaking and entering. Into what? Office spaces, domiciles... Okay, Doug, why don't you break into that house over there? [SIGHS] Traci, you know, you have a lot to learn. Rule number one, never hit a house in your own neighborhood, TRACI: Doug, did you break into your mother's jewelry box? Cabooze. C-A-B-O-O-Z-E, Cabooze, okay. [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Okay, thank you. Thank you. 3970. 3970. What's the rest of the number? Well, I'm not making the call. I just asked you to remember the number. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. It's 3970. Yeah, I did ask you though. No, you said the number. You didn't ask. Well, the way I said the number implied... Didn't I ask him? Does it matter? Cabooze? Hi, Paul Flum from Badmouth. Ah, I know, I'm sorry, we got lost. Where are we? [HOOTING] Horn scan. Euclid between Third and Fourth. Uh, where? Euclid between Third and Fourth. One o' clock. Midnight. Really? Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Okay, bye. It's around the corner, we could walk. LARRY: Well, let's not walk. Let's take the van. We got all our stuff. PAUL: I didn't mean, we should walk. I know we got... It was a figure of speech. Be yourself. Be yourself. Who am I? [CHILDREN TALKING INSIDE] Come on in. GIRL: Quit it, I don't like... This is Matthew. Hi, Matthew, you remind me of my son when he was little. Fuck you. I call him Danny. And this is Lea. Hi, Lea. Hey, surprise, Lea. How would you like chocolate pudding? I don't like it. There's two chocolate puddings, one for you, one for your sister. Now, Mrs. Henzel, I'll call you from the restaurant. Now, let's split while the gettin's good. Okay. Hey, how we doing? Not too good. Boy, this is awful, we're getting slaughtered. [CHEERING] Come on, you guys. Get on it! Hey Tobi, your brother's not doing so good tonight. He's adopted. Great family. Her brother can't stop the puck and she's a little slut. You know, that's a pretty vicious remark. If the truth is vicious, then I'm sorry for telling the truth. Well, the truth is you're jealous because you're fat and you can't get a boyfriend. [HORN BLOWING] [CHEERING] Let's go get a Coke. Here, hold this for me, would you? [MAN SPEAKING ON PA] Hey, what did you say that for? Because Tobi's a friend of mine and she's not a slut. Come on, hey, I like Tobi. But she does sleep around. Is Bill Iverson a slut? You know, he sleeps around. That's different. You know, I think it's kind of weird that you defend Tobi when you have your own attitude about sex. What's my attitude about sex? Obviously, you think there's something wrong with it. Where did you get that impression? Where do you think? I mean, Diane, we've been going together for two years. Now, I have been very patient. Oh, spare me! Now, look... Now, if the guys knew we've been going out this long and we haven't slept together, they'd think that's weird, too. Oh, I see, you want to sleep with me so you can tell the guys. I wanna sleep with you 'cause I love you. You wanna go to that hotel tonight, so you can announce to all guys on Monday that you finally got in my pants. Don't say that. It's not the guys. Forget the guys. Now, I told them months ago that we slept together. What? Well, what was I supposed to tell them? The truth? I mean, it's been two years. Look, don't... Don't touch me! Don't... Now, don't make a big thing out of this. I don't think I did one thing wrong. Damn! Hey, Russ. Hi. You see, Traci, there's a science to this. I'm looking for the right kind of place to hit. You don't believe me, do you? Yeah, I believe you. Doug, what're we doing here? Shh! I'm listening for the right combination of silences. Let's go. Rule number one, make sure nobody's home. [DOORBELL RINGING] Yeah? [VOICE CRACKING] Um... TOBI: Look, just forget him. I have an idea. Lets the two of go out and have a good time. We'll go to the Cabooze and get a real good buzz on. We won't get carded, I know the guy at the door. God, I can't believe that prick! I think you should go to school on Monday and just tell everyone Russ is a lousy lay. [LAUGHS] I have to apologize for Matthew. He's really got the mouth of a gutter snipe. Every time he goes down to Fort Worth to visit his father, he comes back, "Fuck this, fuck that." I don't care. Except for Monday I'm putting Matthew into new school. And I'm terrified that the other kids are gonna go home and say it. And their parents are gonna complain to the school that their kids never said "fuck" before. And the school will figure out it came from Matthew and kick him out. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Look, I got an idea. Why don't you just march down to that school on Tuesday, real angry and say, "My Matthew came home from your school last night and said the 'F' word." [LAUGHS] That'll throw them off the track. [LAUGHS] You folks okay? Another round for us, please. [LAUGHS] I hope you're not trying to get me drunk. 'Cause it just might work.

You know, throughout history, drugs have played a vital role in the development of medicine, science and the arts, but I doubt if any culture is as privileged as ours is tonight, because this particular strain represents centuries of genetic manipulation of Cannabis indica. Ah, blow it out your ass and give me that thing, would you? Ah, I can't find a match. Don't worry. Let's not let this one run, okay? LARRY: Ah... A characteristic aroma, reminiscent of a skunk, actually... It's why some people call it "stink weed." TOBI: Boy, it really does reek. Mmm... I do love that smell.

We got some good news and some bad news. The good news is there's plenty of time to leave a tip for the waiters. The bad news... MAN: One more song! ...is that we're all gonna have to leave immediately in an orderly fashion. We've received a bomb threat. [CROWD JEERING] Well, it wasn't my idea but, just on behalf of John, Sally and Paul, the Badmouthettes, thank you St. Cloud. It's always a lot of fun. We'll see you later. Go home. Okay, Shanto will leave, Route 31, right? Yes, yes, I know. In case you guys get to the hotel before we do, here's the key to my room, just let yourselves in, and we'll get there as fast as we can. Now, you're sure you're coming? Yeah, we're coming. Well, I don't know. Aw, come on, Diane. Just for little while? Yeah, come on, Diane. All they're asking is that you go to a strange man's hotel room. What should be more innocent than that? Thanks a lot, Sally. You're a real icebreaker as usual. Come on, Diane. It's still early. Well, okay. Great. Great. Okay. We'll see you there. Here we go. Yeah. All right. Let's pack up and get out of here before that bomb goes off. RUSS: You, come with me. SALLY: Russ, get lost.

Russ, fuck you! Yeah, well, fuck you. SALLY: Fuck you, you fucker! Well, fuck the both of you! [LAUGHING] Uh-oh. You know, I don't do this all the time. [STAMMERS] No, of course not. I didn't think you did. I like you, Dwayne. You're a good egg. I like you, Peggy. A lot. You know, you meet a lot of bastards out there. I bet. I'll tell you, Dwayne. It's not easy finding Mr. Right. Especially with two little rug rats. Hey, I love kids. And when you do meet Mr. Right, heaven forbid, whatever you do, don't go to bed with him. 'Cause if you let him sleep with you, they never call you back. Really, they don't? Nope. So... You've, um... Worked out a system, huh? Yep. Never sleep with any man who may be Mr. Right? Uh-huh. [MOANING] How's the system working out? I don't know. I haven't tried it yet. [MOANING] This is it. 214. Come on. Oh, look at the atrium, and there's the pool, and here's the radio... And here's the bed. Oh, it's hard as a rock. Diane? Diane, are you okay? [SIGHS] Well, I'm gonna get comfortable. God, it's hot in here. You know, I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this. Come on, Diane. Do you think Paul wants to sleep with me? Duh. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [LAUGHS] You know, I can't believe this. You know, here I am in a hotel room, waiting for a guy I've known two hours, and for two years I've been... ...beating off Russ with a stick. Let's face it, Diane. Russ is a jerk, and he's a little boy. Now, come on. I mean, would you rather lose it to a boy, or uh, to a man? [IN A SING-SONG VOICE] I'm gonna get laid. I'm gonna get laid. Me too. Me too. It's gonna happen to me, it's gonna happen to you. We'll be two happy chappies, before the night is through... We're gonna get laid. We're gonna get laid. [IN A SING-SONG VOICE] Laid... Yeah.

We're in St. Cloud, we got off early, we got paid for the whole night, and we're here with two lovely, young ladies. [LAUGHS] Here's to the guy, who phoned in the bomb threat.

We don't really know each other. Which is why should kiss. It's a great way to get to know each other. I bet you bring girls back to your room in every town. Well, actually... It very rarely happens, but... When it does, it's... It's very special. Come on, Diane. Just give me one kiss. And then if you don't want to kiss me again, fine. But... You know, probably won't happen. You probably won't be able to control yourself. [LAUGHS] Come on. Just one kiss. Okay. One kiss. Or the first kiss. Whichever. Well, uh... I suppose a second kiss wouldn't make any difference, would it? That's nice. [LAUGHS] I feel like one of your groupies or something. Well, actually, this hardly ever happens. But when it does, it's very special. [GIGGLES] You are a nasty man. Yes, I am. [CHUCKLES] He's about 6'1", 190 pounds, he's got lightish hair, he's captain of the football team, you know... Well, are you attracted to him? Yeah, I guess so. Gee, if I were you, I'd sleep with him. Of course, if I were you, I'd sleep with me... But I guess we've covered that subject already. [MOANING] Okay, hang on. [CHANGING MUSIC] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [LAUGHING] And Dad's speech at the funeral meant so much to everyone who loved her. His voice cracked a couple of times but...

Golly, I'm sorry, I fell asleep. No, that's all right. I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful time I had tonight. Me too. Me too. Look, I'll drive you home. No, I called a cab. I'll see you in the office on Monday. And you forgot your compact. Oh. [LAUGHS] Mmm... Good night. And we finally had to take Mom... My mom to the hospital. We visited her every day, and, um... Doctor gave us daily reports on it, and... And she... She'd have to go in for tests all the time... [CRYING] Sometimes we weren't even allowed to see her. And I'll never forget the sight of my mother. In that hospital bed, with all those tubes... [SOBS] It's not fair! Shit! [PANTING] Piss! Fuck! Excuse me, could you tell what room is Badmouth is in? Well, they are in three rooms, sir. Mr. and Mrs. Kinshlow are in one room. Then there's a Mr. Hays, and Mr. Flum. Plum? Flum. Flum? All right, whoever he is, I'll go for him. What room is he in?
