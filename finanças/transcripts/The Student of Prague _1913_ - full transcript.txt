This movie has been shot in the Belvedere castle in Prague... ...in Lobkowitz and other historical places. I am not God, and cannot be the Devil either, but with spite... ...I do pronounce your name! So that wherever you are, I will be too... ...and on your final hour, in front of your tombstone, I will seat on your grave Alfred de Musset The students of Prague... enjoy the good life! "What is the matter with you, Balduin?" "To the best swordsman of Prague and its most audacious student!" Scapinelli was known among the students to be without scruples. "I am ruined! I wish I had some money... ...or a rich heiress!" "I believe there must be some opportunities for the best and most daring swordsman of Prague" The jealous Lyduschka knows all about the old Scapinelli and fears for Balduin. Arrangements are made for the hunt in Count Schwartzenberg's castle. Countess Margit and her cousin the Baron Waldis-Schwartzenberg. "Margit, why do you keep postponing our wedding date? "You know it is your father's dearest wish to see our families united" "My dear cousin, I will obey my father's wishes, but I do not love you" "Look! The horse is going towards the lake!" "Take this locket with my portrait on it, as a keepsake" "I am grateful for life for saving my daughter's life" The next day... "I could be famous like Balduin, the best swordsman, but,... ...my real enemy is the reflection of my own image" Balduin decides to visit the Countess. "May I ask, how does the Countess feel today?" "Balduin, let me introduce you to the Baron Waldis-Schwartzenberg,... ...the future husband of my daughter" Balduin, who is just a poor student, takes his leave. "All she says is "thank you"..., the rich heiress and me... ...just a poor student" "How did you get in?" "...through the door!" "Now, Mister...not only are you the best swordsman... ...and the most courageous, but on top of that..." "...the most rich !!" "What is the bargain?" I certify, I was paid 100.000 golden coins,... ...for giving Scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him... ...from this room. Balduin, Prague, may 13th of 1820 "What a weird guy! Anything from this little room!" "Take whatever you want!" I certify, I was paid 100.000 golden coins,... ...for giving Scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him... ...from this room. Balduin, Prague, may 13th of 1820 "So do choose whatever you like!" "Mister Balduin... I want your image reflected on the mirror. That is my secret". "What did you say? My reflection?" "Nevermind, a contract is a contract!" A new life started for Balduin... "We are invited to the Governor's party" "Dear Countess, do allow me...?" "At last, fate lets us be alone for a while" "Margit...I love you!" "That is impossible" Lyduschka follows the couple. "Goodbye, Balduin" "Am I awake or dreaming? Who are you?" "Is there any problem, my friend? You look pale, don't you feel good?" "Look...what you look like on the mirror" "My dear cousin, do not forget that we are engaged" Balduin is waiting for the Count's carriage... The Countess, in her bedroom... "Yes, Balduin, my heart belongs to you!" Dear Countess, please, I beg you to keep your promess... ...to meet tomorrow afternoon, in the usual place. Lyduschka is looking for the Countess... Countess Margit is leaving for her date. "Wait! If you go to that meeting you'll be in great danger" "What does this gypsy want of me?" Margit tries to gain courage by going to the "Sacred Fountain". Margit, on the thought of the gypsy's warning, prays God. "Why did you choose this place?" "My dear Countess, for the quietness..., the peace..., the solitude..." "Who is he?" "Dear Baron... I believe the Countess has lost her handkerchief..." "How dare you act like that with my fianc?e...?" Balduin, still worried by what happened, returns home... "What brings you here, Baron?" "I don't want to talk. You have tainted my family's honor... ...I am at your disposal" Balduin's representatives talk with the Baron and organize the duel. "Baron, have you chosen yet... sword or gun?" "What do you say? Sword? But isn't Balduin the best swordsman in Prague ?" "What are you doing here, Count?" "I want your word that you will not kill the Baron. He is the only son of my sister, and the future husband of my daughter, he is my heir and the last one to carry our name" "I give you my word, Count!" Balduin goes to the duel... "Where do you go?" The promess he gave to the Count has been broken by his other self. Balduin wants to explain the Baron's death... "The Baron's family has nothing to say to Mister Balduin!" Balduin tries to forget his love. "It's your love I want, not your money!" "Do you want to play cards with me?" "What do we bargain?" "One of us!" And wherever I'll die and rest, there will always be, by my side,... ...a strange man, dressed in black, like a monk. "I have to meet her! I have to try to explain it to her" "Countess, it wasn't my fault!" "Forgive me, do not hold this grudge!" "Balduin, where is your reflection?" "Say whatever you like, what gives you the right to persecute me?" I am not God, nor the Devil either, but with spite... ...I pronounce your name! So that wherever you are, I will be too. Balduin runs away as if he had seen the Devil... "He still follows me!" "Scapinelli, take your money back!" "I still feel his presence!" "I will get rid of you, once and for all... I will kill you with my gun! "I am saved!" "Blood...I am hurt!" I certify, I was paid 100.000 golden coins,... ...for giving Scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him... ...from this room. Balduin, Prague, may 13th of 1820 I am not God, nor the Devil either, but with spite... ...I pronounce your name! So that wherever you are, I will be too... ...and on your final hour, in front of your tombstone, I will seat on your grave. Here lays Balduin.
