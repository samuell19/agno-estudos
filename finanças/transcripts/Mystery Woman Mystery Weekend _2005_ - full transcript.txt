Shhhh Surprise! Ah. - Philby, Philby. - I'm right here. - Look at this. - These are fantastic. Breaking News Magazine's gonna love that. - Better yet, Breaking News Magazine will pay the expenses for our Mystery Weekend, which is costing a little more than I expected. We'd better sell a lot of books. - Which reminds me, look at these. - Wow, they're in color. Philby, they're beautiful. But we can't afford this. - Since when can't we afford free? - Free? What did you do, Philby? - Oh, I called in a favor. - Who are you, Philby? - A guy in need of a cup of tea and a blueberry muffin. Wanna join me? - That is not an answer. - Oh, has Night Christy come in yet? And the new Angela Cook? - Oh, I'm fine, Dorothy. Thanks for asking. - Oh, I'm sorry. But you know me, when I'm expecting first editions, I just can't think of anything else. - It's all right. You're still my best customer. - You mean I'm a mystery nut. Aren't we all? - Here they are, Dorothy. Your Christy. - Oh, gimme, gimme. - Also, you're Candace Robb, your Ellen Hart, your Janet Evanovich, your Angela Cook, and your Christy's on top. - Speaking of Angela Cook, how would you like to meet her? - Oh, would I. - Well, Mystery Woman is hosting a Mystery Weekend, featuring guest writers, and Angela Cook is one of them. We've got cocktails, and book signings and even a Q&A panel for fans. - Ah. Oh. - Here you are, Dorothy. - Oh, I'm really sorry. - Here's your Christy. - They slipped. Oh. Thank you very much. I'm late. - I'll see you this weekend at Thursday Night Mayhem. What was that about? - Oh. It's very strange. It's the tea. Hello. - Okay, I found it. Here it is. - Try to come to this, if you have a chance. It'll be fun. Thanks so much. See you. Can I help you? - Yeah, I saw your flyer in the window. What's, uh, a Mystery Weekend? - Meeting with authors, book signings, buying lots of books from the bookstore owner. Are you a mystery fan? - No, I hate mysteries. I'm a lawyer, I don't like surprises. - Then I won't try to convert you. - Oh, please, don't give up so easily. Miss... - Kinsey, Samantha Kinsey. - Mm hmm. I'm Scott Teller. Well, if anyone could, like, like, convert me into a mystery fan, it would be you. - Well, come to the Mystery Weekend. I'll do my best. - Hmm, I'll take that as a personal invitation. - Um, I'll introduce you to people. It's tough to be new in town. - How did you know that? - Well, you're not a tourist, or you would have said. And I know every lawyer in town. - Hmm. I knew it. This is why I left L.A. No one knows anyone. You have traffic jams, smog, two hour commutes, absolutely no sense of community. Hmm, nothing like a small town. - No, there isn't. Welcome. - Thank you. I think we'll be seeing a lot of each other. - People in small towns are always bumping into each other. - I'll count on it. - Hmm, thanks for coming with me, Cassie. - You're welcome. I love meeting new writers. You never know what to expect. - So, have you met the new lawyer? - Yeah, I heard the new lawyer came to the courthouse to introduce himself. Right, I wasn't in my office, so I didn't meet him. - Well, his name is Scott Teller. And he came into the bookshop - Oh? - Yes. He saw the flyer. He might come to the Mystery Weekend. And what is he like? - Yum. - Really. Excellent. - Mm hmm. - Yes, well, Claire Beckman has very expensive taste. - Paid for by me. When I got the fax requesting a hotel suite for her and her retinue, plus a limo, wished I had invited another writer. - No, you don't. You said that Claire Beckman hasn't attended a bookstore signing since her very first novel. You called her the Mystery Woman Of Mystery. - Well, then she's come to the right bookstore. I am just so glad Angela Cook and Maura Hobbs fell in love with their rooms at Bell's B&B. - Well, who wouldn't love four poster beds and homemade lemon poppy seed cake? - Our elegant Claire Beckman. Hi, I'm Samantha Kinsey. I own Mystery Woman, the bookstore. - For pity sakes, that's the woman who's paying the bills. Let her in. - Hello. - Welcome, I'm Grant Fuller, Claire's fiancee. - I'm Samantha. This is my friend, Cassie Hillman. Miss Beckman, I so admire your books. You write the finest... No, no, no... ...no, no, I'm, I'm not Claire. I'm just her assistant, Beth Temple. Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you. Oh. - Well, nice to meet you, both. Room service. I've been waiting for you. - We just came to welcome Miss Beckman, and make sure she's comfortable. Oh, she is, very. Paolo, grazie. - Is she here? - Yes, she is. But she's writing in there. And she can't be disturbed. - We wouldn't dream of disturbing a writer at work. - I'm sure she won't be more than an hour or so, if you'd like to wait. - Uh, actually, we'd better get back to the bookstore. We have a lot to do before our Mystery Weekend. And tonight is our weekly book club meeting. - Oh, you mean, Thursday Night Mayhem. I read about it in the invitation you sent. You do more than your share to promote mystery novels. Writers appreciate it, Miss Kinsey. - It's my pleasure. Please tell Miss Beckman that we look forward to meeting her at the cocktail party. - Well, thank you, I will. Oh. Hey. Champagne anyone? - No, we're working. - All right. - Oh, we don't have a picture of Miss Beckman. Would you happen to have one? - No. Is that a problem? - Oh, no, not at all. I'll just take one tomorrow night. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm. - I just love these hors d'oeuvres. They're just delicious. It was so funny, I, it was smashing. - Get your picture here, guys. - Oh, yes. Love my corsage. - It looks beautiful. Very nice, thank you. Please, - ...your turn. - Of course. Nice smiles everyone. - Lovely. Everybody having fun? - Oh, yes. - Yeah. - Good. - Yes, thank you. Wherever do you get your ideas, Miss Cook? - Oh, from the newspapers mostly. - Miss Hobbs, what about you? - Since my sleuth is an artist in the Elizabethan Age, I rely on historical research for accuracy. - I love historical novels. - In your latest, William Shakespeare's on trial for murder. I didn't read about that. Was he convicted? - Everybody seems to be having a pretty good time. - Yeah. But where is Claire Beckman? Oh, yeah. It just come to me. No, I haven't finished that one yet. - Excuse me. - Hey, you came. - I had a personal invitation. Quite a party you have here. - Yeah. Cassie. - Hey. - Hi. You look pretty. - Oh, thank you. - Um, Cassie, this is Scott Teller. Remember I told you about him. - Um, you described him perfectly. I'm Cassie Hillman. - The Assistant DA? - Yeah. - Huh, what a pleasant surprise. I've heard nothing but good things about you. - Well, that's nice to hear. - Cassie, will you show Scott to the bar? I actually have to call the hotel and check on Claire Beckman. - Okay. - Hey, Birdie. My schedule clearly said that writers are to arrive by 8:00. - Maybe Claire Beckman didn't get her schedule. - Fiddly Dee. She's making a late solo entrance, so people will think she's the star of the weekend. It's a ploy to sell books. Her sales have dropped. - Yeah, I've heard you have a solid conviction, rate. Now I know why. - Tell me. - Bad guys get one look in those eyes and they just fall down and confess. Seriously. No DA should be as pretty as you. It's not fair to the defense. Just promise me one thing, if we're ever sitting on opposite sides, you'll dowdy yourself up and wear glasses. Cheers. Cheers. - Is something wrong? - No one's answering Claire's hotel suite. - You think something's happened to her? - I don't know. I'm gonna give them two minutes and then I'm going over there. - Whoa, who is that? Humph. Mmm. Hmm. - Welcome to Mystery Woman, Miss Beckman. I'm... I know who you are. And thank you. Thank you for this fabulous weekend. - Miss Beckman, would you please. I'm your biggest fan. And please accept this humble gift from my flower shop. - It's lovely. But, alas, I only wear white flowers. Some of my fans get a little too obsessed for comfort. Besides, you don't really think anybody's gonna mistake me for a mystery fan, do you? Or even one of the other writers. - Oh, actually, have you met Angela and Maura? - I'd love to, darling. But, first, I need to make a little announcement. Everyone, um, may I have your attention? This will only take a moment. Since I owe everything I am to my fans, I feel it's only right that I should tell you first. My current novel is also my last. - Oh, oh. - I'm retiring. Oh, oh, - I've bought a tiny island, between Hawaii and Fiji, where I'll be going for a long overdue rest. After all, I've written 32 novels in 22 years, more than Miss Hobbs and Miss Cook put together. - And I want, one can only hope they're sharks. - Since this is my final book signing, I can assure all of you that the books you purchase this weekend will become collector's items. - Uh, um, this is an unexpected twist. But, then, um, Miss Beckman has been surprising us readers for 22 years. Oh, please don't. Oh. - I'd like to get a picture of you. - Of course. - Okay. - Of course. - Um, Miss Hobbs, Miss Cook. - Of course. - So, whenever you're ready. - Oh, just give me one moment. Thank you. I'm gonna give you a variety of poses. Great. Great. Lovely. - Nice. - Whoa, whoa. - Ow. Cassie. - Oh, my God. Is she all right? - I'm fine. It's just my arm. - You're not fine... - ...you're bleeding. - You know, she could be in shock. - I am so sorry. - Why? You didn't shoot me, did you? - Would you stop being so brave? You just got shot. - Ah, ah. - You know, I'll, I'll go to the hospital with her. Okay, I will be there as soon as I can, Cassie. Are you all right? - I don't know. - Someone just tried to kill her. Of course, she's not all right. - Oh. - Chief Connors - Well, this is a mess. What happened? - A shot was fired. It hit Cassie. But I think it was intended for Claire Beckman, that woman right over there. - Cassie, our Cassie Hillman? The Assistant DA? - Yes. But, I think it was intended for... - Get a hold of Hillman's cases and recent convictions. Find out if somebody's got a beef with her. Your friend here says somebody took a potshot at you. Anybody been threatening you lately? - Can't you see she's in shock? - Oh,. All right, take a deep breath. Now listen, I'm sure this was very upsetting. - All right, listen up, people. Nobody leaves the premises until you've been interviewed and checked for gun powder residue. - Oh. No, we... - Understood. All right, where were you when the shot was fired? - Uh, I was right here. - Mm hmm. And you? - Well, I was just sitting there watching the Mayhem... - Chief, you need to see this. Doctor Wade, ... - Cassie Hillman. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you feeling? - Floating like a butterfly, stinging like a bee. - They gave you a little something for the pain, huh? - Exactly. Did they catch a man, or her? - Oh, not even close. We found the gun, though. Chief Connors sent it straight over to the lab. And then he proceeded to question everybody in the shop, as though they were escaped felons. Even poor Mrs. Blair. - Oh. She's 92. Uh, Connors can be such a jerk. - You know Connors. Everybody on the scene is a suspect. - Why don't I leave you girls to, uh, to talk. Okay? I'll, uh, I'll see you later. - Were we ignoring him? - No. Maybe. You know, that he insisted on getting into the ambulance with me. He held my hand the entire way, and told me everything was gonna be all right. - That is so sweet. - I know. - Most guys aren't that sensitive. - I know. Hello. - Hey, here's your update. - Uh, no, this is Samantha Kinsey. Hold on one second. - All right. - It's your office. They said you asked for an update. - I have a weird interest in this case. Hello. - Hey, your piece here belongs to Dorothy Bayer. - You're kidding. - Wouldn't joke about that. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. - You're not gonna believe this. The gun is registered to Dorothy Bayer. - Dorothy? Come on, that can't be. - I know, it's bizarre. She's lived in the town, what 15 years? - She's practically Ma Walton. - My assistant told me that Chief Connors is waiting for the judge to wake up, so he can obtain a warrant for her arrest. - No, I just can't believe, you get some sleep. I'm gonna go run an errand. - Don't get into any trouble. Who me? The local news is Assistant District Attorney Cassie Hillman was wounded in a shooting incident at the Mystery Woman downtown. - The radio said Cassie was shot. - She's okay. - Oh, thank God. - Personally, I don't think the bullet was intended for Cassie. - Really? Well, then for whom? - Claire Beckman. When the shot was fired, Claire leaned over to catch some books from falling, Cassie got the bullet. - You think someone tried to kill Claire Beckman? - From where I was standing, that's how it looked. And then, of course, Chief Connors questioned everybody. Who are you? Why are you here? You got a beef with the Assistant DA? You know how he is. - But, Claire Beckman, is she all right? - Outside of some minor hysterics, yes. Where were you last night? I missed you. Oh, well, uh, I couldn't come, I, got this cold coming on. - You poor thing. Well, some tea and honey and lots of rest. I'll call you later. - Well, thank you. - By the way, Dorothy. Do you own a gun? - Me? Heavens no. - You might wanna rethink that answer. I just can't believe Dorothy did it. I know, I know, she owns the gun. But, I've known Dorothy forever and she's... She's not capable of murder? - Unfortunately, under the right circumstances, everybody's capable. - It's true. Then what makes you think Dorothy didn't do it? - A real mystery buff, like Dorothy, would never make such obvious mistakes. I mean, if Dorothy were going to kill someone, she wouldn't use her own gun, A. And B, she would have prepared an alibi. That's Murder 101. - Well, maybe. But you saw her reaction when she looked at our flyers. It was absolute panic. - I know, you're right. But if this hinges on strange behavior, we have to think about Beth and Grant. Did you see the looks on their faces when Claire announced her retirement? - They were stunned, but still. The attempt was made with Dorothy's gun. - I know. But there is no connection between Dorothy and Claire Beckman. So that means there's no motive. - Can I open the door? - Yeah, make it fast. - Ever since the attack on Claire, reporters have been coming in, reporters wanting interviews. Our next two events are sold out. Everybody loves a murder. Doctor Gordon to Pediatrics. - Hey. - Hey. - Blueberry scones from Madeline's Bakery. - How did you know I was starving? - Any news from Chief Connors? - They searched Dorothy's house. And they found mystery books and memorabilia, including a plastic replica of the Maltese Falcon and scrapbooks. - Nothing else? - No. In Chief Connors' opinion, her obsession with murder pushed her over the edge. - Okay. So, reading mysteries leads to attempted murder. That makes a lot of sense. Did she have a lawyer? - Yes. Scott. Now I can't talk to him about the case. How's that for star-crossed? - Well, maybe a man who sends roses doesn't wanna talk shop. Love, Scott. Scone? - Very pretty. - Mm hmm. - Open on the gate. Four, one, two, nine, six. - Break back. You have 10 minutes. - How are you, Dorothy? - Confused. This has all happened so fast. But my lawyer, Scott Teller, he's a very smart young man. And he's new in town. - I know him, Dorothy. What is he telling you? - Well, Scott says that the evidence against me is all circumstantial. - It is. What else? - Well, when I told him that I was at the Group Thursday Night Mayhem, he, oh, he liked that name. He said anyone could have sneaked into my house and stolen my gun. - A distinct possibility. What else? - Well, um, I've been an upstanding member of this community for over 15 years. I don't even have a parking ticket. And Scott says it wouldn't take Perry Mason to convince a judge that I am an unlikely killer. - I agree with that. But, why did you lie about owning a gun? - It was nobody's business. - You're right. Your gun is nobody's business. But, to lie about having it makes it look like you're hiding something. - If that's what you want to think. - Dorothy, what I want is to help you. We've been friends for a really long time. Just tell me what I can do for you. - I don't need your help. - Watch yourself. This is fascinating. The murder weapon is poison, distilled from foxglove. Something wrong? - I need your help, Philby. Unit 17, please respond to the corner of Grand and Third, possible 5150. - Come on, come on. - Breaking and entering makes me so hungry. Hey, how'd you know the police were coming? - Try this. - Huh. It's a radio set to the police frequency. I want one. - Sorry. It's a prototype, one loaned from a former employer. It has an unusual range. - Really? From how far can you pick up signals? - Beijing. - Huh. - You said the name on the check stub was CSC Services. - Each check was written for $900. Dorothy's scrapbook surprised me. All those clippings of real life cases. Dorothy has never shown any interest in true crime stories. - I know. But she was an avid fan of Mary Dehimes. And Dehimes' sleuth Emma Lord. She ran a newspaper. - That's right. Dorothy once said the journalists make the best snoops, because people answer their questions just to hear their names in print. - Were there any bank records, any collection letters, was she in financial trouble? - I don't know. I didn't have time to look. - I've been to CSC Services, locally, regionally and nationally. But nothing. There's no listing of CSC Services anywhere in the country. - It's strange. I'm beginning to think our real mystery is Dorothy. Oh, I gotta take Angela and Maura to lunch. It's the least I can do after last night. Neither one of them sold any books. - You can tell them tonight's event is sold out. - They will be thrilled. - I'll see you later. - Sold out, marvelous. - You both are getting a ton of phone numbers. - I'm not surprised. Last night's shooting made the news all across the country. - Oh, that darling little Anderson Cooper did a story on CNN. Real life mystery at Mystery Bookstore. Didn't you love the way he said it, with that adorable little twinkle? - CNN, I had no idea. - You're famous, my dear. - Well, the bookstore's famous. He didn't mention her name. - Okay, you guys are the experts. Who do you think killed her? - You. - What? - Motive, publicity for your store. - Means, the gun belonged to one of your friends, and was rigged in your store. - Opportunity. - Ample. - Congratulations, Samantha. Your grand publicity stunt worked like a charm. - I wish we'd thought of it. - But my best friend got shot. - Oh, glitch in your plot. Happens to the best of us. - I did not try to kill Claire. - Of course, you didn't, darling. More likely one of these biddies did it. - Your theory is as trumped up and phony as your books. - That's vile. Claire's work is brilliant. Her plots are meticulous, her characters speak... - That's enough... - ...Beth. Can't you see these hacks are just jealous? - Huh. - Come. - O-oh, lobster salad with shaved truffles, my favorite. Waiter. And thanks again for lunch, dear. - It was so rich. - Almost too rich. The usual? - Hey, Grant. - May, ho. - Something wrong? - Uh uh. No. Just because Claire decided to call off our engagement doesn't mean I'm not having a wonderful time. - She called it off? Why? - Yeah. Suddenly I remind her of her ex-husband, Dennis, who dumped her. Got half her money, ran off to Nova Scotia. She's still sending him checks. - Man, you must be devastated. - I do everything for Claire. She's the love of my life. - I can see that. Well, just give her some time. It could be that what happened last night, you know, getting shot at and all, might have unnerved her. - Claire, unnerved. You think so? - It's entirely possible. - Yeah, it's really nice of you to say. Thank you. - First they accuse me of attempted murder, and then they order lobster salad. That reminds me of a mystery by Eleanor James. This family is so delighted at the death of their tyrannical father, they cover up for the brother who did it. They like you. They hate Claire. - But they love solving mysteries, no matter who did it. I checked with Bell's B&B, Angela and Maura were telling the truth. Neither one of them left after dinner. - The ex-husband, what was his name? - Dennis. Grant said that Claire was still sending him checks. What if somehow he knew that she was retiring? That would no more checks for the ex. Could that make him angry enough to kill her? - Well, maybe. - Maybe not. - Well, there's no listing of Dennis Beckman in the Nova Scotia Directory. He's probably unlisted. - We have to find him, Philby. - ID, please. Very good. Request, please. - Background and whereabouts of Dennis Beckman. Rumored to be in Nova Scotia. - Dennis Beckman currently teaches Middle School English in Halifax. He's been confined to a wheelchair since an automobile accident two years ago. He's about to marry his physical therapist. - Huh. - Anything else? - Yes. Give my regards to the PM. - Thank you, sir. He'll be pleased to hear from you. - Did you hear that? Claire's ex, he can't easily travel. And he's giving up the money himself by remarrying. The PM? Philby. You're a spy. - Samantha. Your flowers for tonight. Including this beautiful corsage, a real stunner. I'm supposed to drop it off at the hotel. - Who ordered all this? - Claire Beckman. She does have class, doesn't she? - Yikes. Hey, so the appetizers will be ready in 20 minutes. And then, and I hate to ask you, Philby. But do you mind picking them up? Oh, thank you so much. Honestly, I'm running way behind. And I haven't even gotten dressed yet. - I'll be out in a second. I said I'll be out in a second. Oh. - Huh, huh. Scott, uh. - I didn't mean to spook you. Huh. You didn't startle me. - You always carry a bottle of acid with you? - Okay, so I was a little spooked. - I thought you might have time for a little, um, private celebration, before the big event. Where are the glasses? - Well, they're there, but... - No buts. You work too hard. Oh. - To the nicest surprise of my life, and the luck that brought us together. To you, Samantha. - To luck. You guys still having fun? - Oh, yeah. - Wonderful. - Okay, good. I think we're all set. - That's good. Let's hope there are no surprises tonight. Uh huh. Hi. Hey, Cassie. How are you feeling? - Fine. Honestly. - Doesn't she look great? You look great, too. - Well, here we are again, waiting for Claire. - Well, she's certainly mastered the art of the grand entrance. - Oh, peculiar talent for such a reclusive writer. - Well, she has written 30-something books over the last 22 years. I mean, that is an astonishing amount of work. She'd have to be reclusive. - Or crazy as a Betsy bug. Speak of the devil. - Gentlemen. - Miss Beckman, a few reporters would like to talk to you. Would that be okay? - Oh, of course. I'd be happy to speak to anyone who asks. But let's do television first, while my makeup's still perfect. - I totally get it. You know what? Everyone, may I have your attention, please? - Huh. - I think it's important that before we begin tonight's festivities, we have a round of applause for our lovely hostess. Yes. That's not necessary. Thank you. - Oh, oh, oh. - Oh. - Oh. - Claire. - Let's just step back and give her some room, okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - This is real. - She's dead. - Watch your back. - This is good. - Let me help you, okay. I'm so sorry. - Stay away from her. - If at first you don't succeed. - She collapsed. - Last night somebody takes a shot at her. Tonight she just up and dies. - Beth, I can't imagine how difficult this is for you. But we need to find out what happened to Claire. Did she have any health problems? - High blood pressure, very. - Did you hear that? - High blood pressure. So? - So she could have had a stroke. - The coroner will determine the cause of death, Miss Kinsey. That's what he does. Until then, listen up, people. Nobody leaves the premises until you've all been interviewed. - Oh. - And no cell phones. - Oh. - You see anybody pull out a cell phone, confiscate it. We don't need the whole world knowing about this. And nobody leaves town without my permission. You try it, you'll spend time in my jail. - Hmm - Oh. - And you won't like the food. - Ah, oh. - Your Mystery Weekend's over. And this is a crime scene now. Boys take the body. - All right? - I don't believe it. I mean I can't, I can't believe it. - Were you aware that Claire had high blood pressure? - She didn't, she didn't mention it, to me. But she was taking medication. - What kind of medication? - Just always assumed that they were happy pills. - Sam.... Sam, I'm going to the coroner's office to wait for the preliminary report. - Are you sure you feel up to it? - Yes, I feel up to it. You need to stay here. I'll get a ride from an officer. - Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can. - You know, I don't like the way the chief was talking to you. - He's just mad because someone broke the law in his town. He takes it personally. - But if he ever does accuse you, I'll be happy to represent you. Officer, can we have a cigarette? Just think of the time we can spend together. - In jail? - Okay, you got me. Let's get out of here and have a drink. - I would love to, but, you know, after all that's happened. - I'm gonna keep asking. - Hey, Cassie. So sorry to keep you waiting. I had to stay until everyone left. - Perfect timing, the prelim just came in. - All ready? - Well, the coroner doesn't come in at night, very often. I asked him very nicely. - You flirt? - I needed the practice. Scott asked me out. - He asked me out, too. - Really? - I guess he likes us both. - But he knows that we're friends. That's tacky. - Maybe tacky in a small town is sophisticated in a big city. - Yeah, lots of men go out with more than one woman at a time. - Yeah, men we don't wanna date. What do you have? - The cause of death is a reaction to an unknown toxin of blood samples being sent to the lab. Tomorrow morning... - Let me see that. Well, isn't that interesting? And I thought you just hugged her to death. Miss Hilman. Chief Connors. - Since when does the District Attorney's Office share information with civilians? - What information? We were talking about our boyfriend. - I'm gonna go. - This is Chief Connors. I need you to prepare three search warrants for those addresses that I left on your desk. Yeah, leave the top section blank. As soon as the report comes back from Toxicology, we'll fill that in, slap them down on the judge's desk and get his John Hancock on them. Come on, let's go. Huh. What, no, no, all right, now listen to me. Make sure that you do not let our little Assistant DA know what we're up to. - Because all she does is blab to her little girlfriend. All right, it's about time. Come on, speedy, let's go, let's go. Clean it good tonight. - Cassie. - I knew you'd be back here, my ride home. - I need to see Claire's clothes. - Her clothes? But we don't know yet what toxin killed her. - I'm not looking for what, I'm looking for how. She hugs me and then dies of a reaction to a toxin? It had to get into her system somehow. - I don't know. - Two minutes, two minutes, please. - Letting you in here could so get me fired. - Ow. I found a vial and a needle attached to the corsage. I pricked my finger on the needle. - Oh, my God. - I'm still alive. - So the corsage wasn't poisoned. - So it seems. - Huh. - Hey, Dan. Are you sure it was Claire Beckman who ordered those flowers? You recognized her voice? - Well, I wish it was Claire that called. I would have loved to have spoken to her direct. Actually, the order came in via fax from the hotel. - Terrific. So it could have been anyone. Okay, thanks. - Aye, Samantha, do you know if the police wanna collect that fax as evidence - Why? - A murdered mystery writer's last signature, together with a fax ordering what CNN is calling the flowers of doom. Uh, I'm thinking 10, 15 thou. - Nothing sells like murder. - Ain't that the truth? - Samantha, I just heard. It's awful. Such a fabulous writer. But it does get me off the hook. - Does it? How? - Last night I had dinner at Bell's B&B, and then I spent the evening player poker with Christy Bell. I won nine dollars, and an ironclad alibi. - Claire was poisoned by a toxin someone planted on her, before she got to my bookstore. - Poisoned? Not shot? - Dorothy, what made you think you'd need an alibi? You're hiding something, Dorothy. What is it? - I don't have to answer your questions. - No, you don't. But if I were you, I would rather answer my questions than wait for Chief Connors to ask them. I'm your friend, he is not. - I don't have anything to say. - A poisoned corsage? A poisoned corsage was the weapon in Claire Beckman's first novel, The Prom Queen Murder. - A copy of which was on Dorothy's shelf, so we know she's read it. - A lot of people have read it, including me. - But, Philby, everything is pointing to her, her gun, her lies. - I just got a call from the lab. The toxin that killed Claire was bee venom. - Bee venom? Well, no wonder it didn't affect me. I'm not allergic. Only someone very close to Claire would know she's allergic to bee venom. Dorothy didn't know her. There's no way she could have done it. Huh. - Bee venom, oh, what a sublime idea. I smell bestseller. - Me, too. It's a brilliant poison. It works only on people who are allergic to bee stings, which narrows the field of suspects. I just wish that Chief Connors would give us permission to leave. I need to get back to my work. - At least the weekend hasn't been a total loss. I'm going home with a plot for my next Magnum Opus. - Oh, no, you don't, Angela. I'm doing Claire's murder. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You can both do it. You write contemporary mysteries, so you use the bee venom. And your Elizabethan victim could be locked in a room with a beehive. Excellent. - Okay, I'm gonna leave you ladies to your creative discussions. How are you holding up? - Well, I still can't believe that I've lost her. - You poor thing. Didn't you really lose Claire when she broke off your engagement? - Actually, Claire was coming around. No, you were right, Samantha. After the attempt on her life, she was so upset, she wasn't thinking clearly. - So are you saying the engagement was back on? - I was there last night, wasn't I? - It's true, you were. If you don't mind me asking, how did you and Claire meet? - In an elevator, at a resort spa in Arizona. Claire was there recovering from some cosmetic procedure. I stepped into the elevator and there she was, arguing with Dennis. He was shouting, she was shrieking. - What were they fighting about? - Well, let me see, um, Dennis was upset, angry because of something that she hadn't told him before they'd gotten married. Oh, he was furious. - What happened next? Well, I winked at her. And she laughed. And the rest is roses, as they say. And divorce, and happily ever after for us, until last night. - Did you know that Claire was allergic to bee stings? - Claire liked international spas and luxury resorts. We didn't really encounter a lot of bees. - And what about the medication? - I looked at the bottle of Reserpine. It's a common blood pressure medication. - So Beth was telling the truth. - Am I interrupting something? - No, not at all. Please, come in. - Beth, I just, uh, wanted you to know that I'm so sorry for your loss. Can I do anything for you? - That's very kind, but, no. I'm packing. - Are you leaving? - Well, Chief Connors hasn't given us permission, yet. But, until he does, I'm moving to Bell's B&B. This suite is far too expensive. - No, please stay. You have too much on your mind to think about moving for a day or so. - Thank you. I miss her so much. - You worked with Claire for a long time? - Yes. She hired me straight out of school. - Well, you must have been invaluable to her, especially since she was away so much. Most writers are chained to their desks. I understand Claire liked to travel. - Grant told you this? - He mentioned it. - Claire could dictate anywhere, under any circumstances. She was the most dedicated writer I've ever known. - Let me help you with this. Thirty-one books, you'd have to be dedicated. Maybe it's too early to ask, but do you have any plans? - I'm executor of Claire's literary estate. - That should keep you busy for a while. - No one knows this yet, but Claire's written several manuscripts that haven't been published. - So there's more to come. Well, that's good news for her readers. - Claire won't be forgotten. Her legacy will be my life's work. - Well, Beth, if I don't see you again, good luck. I found this in the pocket of Claire's cape, the one she wore the night Cassie got shot. - It's a common gage of fishing line. You could buy it in any sporting goods store. - I think Claire staged the attempt on her life herself. That night when I asked to take her picture, she put her cape back on. And then she turned away, presumably to check her makeup. But what if she planted the wire on one of these shelves, and the other end of the wire was attached to the trigger on the gun, which was aimed directly at her chair? So, whenever you're ready. - Oh, just give me one moment. - Okay. - Thank you. - And then when she was certain no one was looking... - Then she pocketed the wire. But how could she be certain she wouldn't accidentally shoot herself? By acting like a prim Donna. - I'm gonna give you a variety of poses. - Great. She dramatically threw open her cape, knocking off a pile of books. And when she bent down to pick them up, - Oh. - Bang. Angela was right, it was a publicity stunt. - Her sales were slipping. She wanted to retire. She needed a boost. - But she didn't wanna die. I doubt she rigged the bee venom. - Oh. Well, a publicity stunt's no good, unless you survive it. - I have a warrant to search the premises for the presence of bee venom. Go to it. - Yes, sir. Follow me. - You can wait outside. There's nothing here, we're moving on. I'll meet you at Dorothy Bayer's house. - All right, chief. - The writer you invited to town gets shot at with your friend's gun. And the only thing they got in common is you. - Chief. - I'm not accusing you of anything, Miss Kinsey. But I have never investigated a premeditated murder, where the victim and the prime suspect have never met. Let's go. - They had to know each other. - Those have got covers on them. Those are first editions, for God's sakes. There's nothing inside of them. Please, you gotta watch those books. Samantha. Oh, Samantha, please come in. These men are wrecking my house. It's just not fair. - Dorothy, you can't take this search personally. It's standard police procedure. They searched my bookstore. - They did? - Scene of the crime. They wrecks the place, it's their job. - You, stop shaking that skull. You set that down. It's ceramic and it will break. They're amateurs, amateurs. I swear, if they do find any evidence, they'll just trample over it. Oh, don't tell me. You've found my HC Bailey. - You can thank Philby. He found a collector in Maine. The poor guy has to sell his entire collection to pay back taxes. - I would love to collect first editions. But the best cost thousands. - Well, they're worth it. - You have quite a collection. Admit it, Dorothy, you're a secret Internet billionaire. Don't I wish? I have a small inheritance. It's not much. But I live very frugally. And books are my only indulgence. - Speaking of books, I just heard that Claire Beckman left several unpublished manuscripts. - Really? Oh, now that's something to look forward to. - You like Claire's work? - Oh, it's wonderful. It's logical, detailed, full of surprises. She kept readers guessing. - That she did. When did you meet her? - Oh, I didn't. Remember? I missed the cocktail party. - That's strange. Because Claire knew you. Well enough to know you had a gun in your house. - Well, how could Claire know that? - I'll tell you a secret, Dorothy. Claire Beckman staged the first attempt on her life. - You don't mean that. - The thing I couldn't understand is why Claire would steal your gun for her publicity stunt. - Well, it doesn't make sense. - I figure she broke in and took it, while you were at Thursday Night Mayhem. - Well, that could be, but... - Claire staged the attempt on her life, for publicity. But why did she wanna frame you? - Frame me? - She used your gun. It's registered. She knew it would lead back to you. Every mystery fan knows that when one person frames another, the motive is to get rid of that person who's causing them trouble. What kind of trouble were you causing Claire Beckman? - I didn't know her. - Okay. Let's pretend that this is a novel. You have this character, who lives on a pension. But she buys first editions. Where does this character get the money? - She's frugal. - If this character spent every cent of her pension on one HC Bailey, it wouldn't be enough. My guess is this character has been blackmailing someone. - That's ridiculous. - Then you don't mind if the police go through your bank records? You're not worried they're gonna find large sums that have been transferred from Claire's account into yours? Dorothy, what do you know about Claire Beckman that she's trying to hide? Tell me. - Recognize this? We found it in your desk about an hour ago, stuffed under a scrapbook. CSI just confirmed it's bee venom. Excuse me. You're under arrest for the murder of Claire Beckman. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - I didn't kill her, Samantha. - You have the right to have an attorney... - The real killer is going to a lot of trouble to frame Dorothy. That bottle of bee venom was not in her desk, when I went through it. - I admire your loyalty, Samantha. But Dorothy could have put that bottle there herself. She could have taken it from somewhere else in the house. - Dorothy would never leave the murder weapon in the first place the police would look. She would have hidden it or buried it. - Real life killers make more mistakes than fictional ones. You know that. - In crimes of passion, yes. But not in a murder as carefully planned as this. Someone planted that bee venom in Dorothy's house. - Is that what you're gonna tell Chief Connors? - Well, then I'd have to tell him that I was in her house. And he frowns on breaking and entering. - He also knows that you and Dorothy are friends. And you might be lying to protect her. - We'd know that Dorothy is lying about something. Maybe Grant and Beth aren't telling all they know, either. Philby, you said you knew Grant Fuller's father from Skull And Bones. What's his first name? - Um, Morgan. Morgan Fuller, Boston. - City and state, please. - Boston, Massachusetts. - What listing? - Yeah, a listing for Morgan Fuller. - Just one moment, please. - The grieving continues. - Hmm. You sound like Beth. Serious, serious. You know, life is short, honey. You gotta have some fun. - You're right. Tequila Sunrise, please. - You got it. - So, what'd you think? Will Claire's ex show up for her funeral? - Unless he wanted to make sure she was dead. - You said he ran off to Nova Scotia. It seems kind of drastic. Why so far? - Here you are. - Well, when I said ran off, I guess I was exaggerating. He simply went home. - He was born there? - Yeah, so was Claire. And they, they met in Halifax. That's where they were married. - Well, I'll say this for Claire. People either loved her or hated her. - And sometimes both in the same day, - Her fans loved her. But, then they, didn't know her. You and Beth loved her, but then you both needed her. - I didn't need Claire. I just loved her. - No, you needed her. You're broke, Grant. Your wealthy family disowned you. - How did you know that? - I called your father in Boston, pretending to be the hotel manager. I told him that you had instructed me to send him your bill. - Oh, God. - He said, no, vividly, in language one does not expect from a Boston Brahman. - My father is an evil puritan geezer. - You were living off Claire. - Yeah, you make me sound like some kind of gigolo. You know, I was Claire's fiancee. - So you say. I only have your word that you and Claire reconciled. - Why else would I have been at your bookstore with Claire? - I had an open bar. Or you wanted to make certain that your bee venom corsage actually killed her. My corsage? You're out of your mind. - Are you in Claire's will, Grant? - Yeah, I don't know. - So you don't know where your next hotel suite's coming from, do you? - I wouldn't say that. - Yoo hoo, sweetheart. You little doll, you. - Samantha. - Sorry to bother you, again. - Please, come in. I was just typing Claire's last dictation. Frankly, I was hoping you were Chief Connors. - Really? Most people try to avoid him. - I'd kiss him, if he'd let me go home. I wanna go home. - I know you do. Beth, I have a confession to make. - Oh? - The last time I was here I took something. - A souvenir? - Not exactly. I found a piece of fishing wire in Claire's pocket. The same wire that was attached to the gun used in the attempt on Claire's life. - I don't understand. - I think I do. Claire staged the first attempt herself, for publicity. She'd never do that. She didn't have to. She was the finest mystery writer in the world, better than Agatha Christie. - Do you remember the first time I came to this room? - With your friend, yes. What of it? - You said Claire was in there writing. - She, she was. She was dictating. - Maybe that's what she told you. But what if she lied? - Claire wouldn't lie to me. - I said what if. Just think about it, Beth. She could have slipped out and gone to Dorothy's house, taken Dorothy's gun. - She didn't do that. Why would she do that? - Book sales had dropped. She needed the publicity. And she wanted to frame Dorothy. - She didn't even know who this Dorothy person was. - Sure she did. And someone as close to Claire as you, would know that. - I know nothing of this. Why don't you ask this Dorothy person if she knew Claire? - I did. She lied. - Killers lie. - Hey, Cassie. Yeah, it's me. - What? - Could you do me a quick favor? - Yeah. - And check out a few names for me. - Sure. - Great. Pope... - Uh huh. - ...Lathen ... - Uh huh. - ...McClean ... - Uh huh. - McIsaac. They've all been incarcerated. - I'll see what they have. - Oh, great. Oh, by the way, dinner's at the morgue tonight. - How... - Okay, I'll see you. Bye. - I should not be doing this. - Just one little peek, and I will owe you so big, anytime, anywhere, you call me, I'm there. - I'll remember that. Hey, you have 30 seconds. Go. - I knew it. I knew it. - Knew what? - CSC stands for Correctional Services Of Canada. - Canada, of course. - Correctional Services Of Canada, overseas The Canadian Prison System, including their Pension Department. - And Dorothy's $900 checks might be a pension. - That's what I think. So the question is why was Dorothy getting a pension from the Canadian Prison System? I doubt they send pensions to convicts. - Is this Dorothy's weapon? This is a service revolver. - A police weapon? - Yes - Philby. I know what happened. If you need me, I will be with Cassie. I know what happened, Dorothy. I know where you met Claire. - You think you do. - You were a guard at Plymouth Prison in Canada. The two killers from your scrapbook clippings, Lathen and Pope, they're still at Plymouth, serving life sentences. - So? - So Plymouth was also the home to these teenage girlfriends, Lily McIsaac, and Marcia McClean. These girls killed Lily's mom, because Lily's mom was taking her from Halifax to live in London. The girls freaked out, at the thought of being separated. So one night, they snuck into Lily's house and they bashed the mom's head in. They then took all the money from her wallet, and broke a window to make it look like an intruder had done it. - Not typical teens. - Unfortunately, for them, Lily started to miss her mom. So, in a fit of grief or maybe even conscience, she confessed. Dorothy, you can stop lying. Your employment records and fingerprints are still on file at Plymouth. Once the DA finds them, you're sunk. - Well, it wasn't conscience that made Lily confess. Oh, maybe when she was alone, she might have felt a twinge or two. But, together, those two were cold as ice. - So you're admitting that you knew them? - Sam, I know the law on both sides of the border. It's your word against mine. - Then you won't mind if I finish my story. - No, feel free. - When they became adults, the girls were released, in accordance with Canadian law. - Here, they would have tried them as adults. And they both had been given the death penalty. - And then Claire's first book came out. And you went to her first and only book signing, aside from this weekend. You, immediately, recognized her as Marcia McClean. And when the book was a hit, you saw an opportunity to make some money. So, you contacted her, and threatened to expose her. Do you actually think I am going to admit to blackmail? - When you threatened Claire, she paid up. Because after all, it's very different to write about murder than it is to be part of a sick duo, that bludgeoned a woman to death. And then you saw the flyer for the Mystery Weekend. And you got really upset. - I didn't kill Claire. - I believe you, Dorothy. And I have reason to believe that somebody planted that bee venom at your house. But, unless you tell your story, you could be convicted of murder. - If I admit to blackmail, it is over. - Dorothy, you were part of the system. You're gonna have to trust the system. - The system I was a part of doesn't have a death penalty. Oh, Sam, go away. - What about Claire, Dorothy? Was she the instigator? - Well, she planned the murder. - Then what about Lily McIsaac? - Lily did the actual killing. Oh, she'd have done anything that Claire wanted. - And where is she now? - Well, in a mental institution, I suppose. - She was mentally ill? - She had to be. Everyday, she would write this poetry, it was dark, it was demented. Poems about death. Oh, she gave me the creeps. - I'll be back. - Sam, hey. - Dorothy confessed that she was blackmailing Claire Beckman. But if Chief Connors asks, she's gonna deny it. So we still have to prove it. - I checked out our boyfriend. - And? - He's been fired from every law firm in L.A., Dover, Michigan to Cleveland, Ohio. He's been repeatedly sued for malpractice, involving negligence. - He's a terrible lawyer. - Totally incompetent. Every time he gets caught, he moves to a new town. - That's disgusting. - It's criminal. - He's slime. Thanks, I'll see you later. - Samantha. Chief Connors just had a press conference. He's so confident he has the right person. He stopped all interviews. And all the persons he's already interviewed are free to leave town. - Grant and Beth will be on their way to the airport. We gotta go. Okay, Philby. Go to the bar and see if Grant's there. If he is, delay him. I'm gonna go talk to Beth. One of them has go to know the whole story. - I got it. Hey, what's your hurry? Bartender, let me buy you a drink. - I never say no. Huh. - I'm glad this is over. I warned Claire about obsessive fans. But she wouldn't listen. - She never believed a stalker fan could kill her? - For all her drama, she was very naive. - Well, I'm happy it's over, too. I just wanted to come say goodbye. - What are you doing? - You're Lily McIsaac. You and Claire killed your mother, when you were 15. - I don't know what you mean. - When you were teenagers, you gave each other homemade tattoos, to symbolize your unbreakable bond. - No, Claire had the tattoo. I liked her's, I, I did this myself. - Beth, no jury will believe that. Not after they hear your story. Your mother's murder was Claire's idea, wasn't it? But you went along. You'd do anything to stay with her. - Put that down. - Seventy-six pages. That's a nice beginning to your next novel. - You have no right, put that down. - Claire didn't write the mystery novels, you did. You're a compulsive writer. Thirty-one novels in 22 years. That's not just prolific, that's insane. - Give me the manuscript. - Writing mysteries was your idea, wasn't it? This time it was Claire who went along. She was more than happy to take credit. She loved the limelight as much as you hated it. Everything was great, except Claire was being blackmailed by Dorothy. And your book sales were dropping. You saw your world crumbling around you. So you devised a perfect plot, to boost your book sales, and to frame your blackmailer. And then your lives would be perfect again. But then Claire delivered a terrible shock. She announced her retirement. She didn't even tell you about it, after. - She was gonna abandon me. After all I did for her. - You killed for her. You made her rich. Not only was she leaving you, she was taking your work to a writer, as compulsive as you. That's gotta be like tearing your heart out. - I lived for her. And she knew that. But she didn't care. She said we had enough money. She wanted to be free. She wanted to stop playing the role of a novelist. She said she was sick of it. She wanted me to stop writing. But I couldn't, I can't. - I know you can't. - Claire said a lot of things. But it all added up to one thing, she wanted to be free of me. - So you started thinking. And you did what you do best. You came up with a plot. With Claire dead, you could continue publishing her manuscripts, as though she had written them. And Claire deserved to die, too, didn't she? For leaving you, for not loving you the way you loved her. She broke your heart. - I told her without her my life was over. And do you know what she said? She said I was crazy. She told me I should get a life. Well, I had a life, but she took it. So I took hers. - If you kill me, you'd never be able to explain it. - I've been writing mysteries all my life. I'm sure I can come up with some kind of story everybody will believe. - If you shoot me, this goes in the fire. - Ah. Oh. - That's her. But how did she get the bee venom? - On the Internet by overnight mail. Apparently, there are 28 sites for beekeepers. Oh, weird little Beth would know that. - Dorothy, I just filed a motion for your release. - Not so fast. Oh, your friend's gonna have plenty of time to read. Miss Bayer, you're under arrest for felony blackmail. Three to five years, - Hmm. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you, in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney to be present during your questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one for you. - Huh. - Bye. - Do it again soon. - What's wrong with you? - Uh, first client in town's been arrested three times. - That is depressing. - So you have to take pity and, uh, have dinner with me. - Dinner sounds great. Cassie and I are going out for Italian. - Uh, do you want me to join you? - Hmm. I want you to leave, Scott. Go find yourself a nice city somewhere, with lots of golf courses, where the clients you neglect can sue you bankrupt. The kind of city where you can date five women at once, and they won't compare notes. A nice sleazy town where no one will notice what an incompetent fool you are. Hmm. I'm not quite sure what to say. - Try goodbye. - Hmm, good job, girl. I thought you'd like it.
