(gentle music) (soft music) - Hyde Park has a kind of serenity today. The sort of serenity I feel now. Although, perhaps justice better describes it. Yes. A poetic justice. It is hard now to believe that the entire adventure began just three months ago. It had been April 12th, 1874. I remember the date well, for Gilbert and Sullivan's new play, HMS Pinafore, had opened the night before. (chuckles) I recall how Sir Arthur's music haunted me as I approached Jack's flat in Victoria. Our engagement had been terminated a week earlier, when my father decided that a school master was simply not the proper match for his only daughter. I was, you see, an innocent maiden then. Indeed, I scarcely believe how innocent I really was. Just three short months ago. (light knocking) (thunder rumbling) - Alice. Dear, Alice. - I've only stopped by for a moment. Your letters and books. - Yes, I've missed them. - But you're alone, quite alone. Is Marion not with you? - Oh! Marion, yes. My sister. She had a wretched headache. - Oh, how sad. Won't you come in? You look rather frantic. In fact, rather wild. It suits you. - No! I can't. I had a dreadful afternoon at Harrods. And I'm in a frightful hurry to get home. - Well, have a good day, and give my best wishes to Marion for a speedy recovery. (thunder rumbling) - Good heavens! I've ruined my frock. Could I possibly borrow your umbrella? - Yes, do come in while I go and look. Won't you come in? - I'll wait right here while you get the umbrella. - Frightfully sorry, vanished. Although I could have sworn I put it in the stand. I must have left it in my study at school. How careless of me. - You always-- (thunder rumbling) (gasps) - Oh no! Oh, I am sorry. Oh no! Do you have something that will calm me? - Of course. Tea? - Please. Two sugars. Why, cucumber sandwiches. How recklessly extravagant. - For you, my dear. - How delightfully thoughtful. (thunder rumbling) - Thank you. - My goodness. Oh my goodness! It seems to be getting worse out there. At this rate, I shan't get home this evening. What horrid fortune! - What seems horrid fortune often is a blessing in disguise. - Why, whatever do you mean, Jack? (thunder rambling) Oh, Jack! I'm petrified of thunderstorms. - By jove, it is coming down, and it looks though it might last. How unfortunate! - Oh, Jack! I'm frightened. - Then, why don't you take refuge with me in the snuggery? For in there, you'll not hear the thunder. It's a soundproof room. Shall we? (thunder rumbling) - Yes! Yes! Yes! - Behold! - Wow! It's huge, Jack. Whatever do you do here? - It's a private study for studying private things. I never let school et cetera, intrude. - Look, rain. Oh dear! No exit? - Ah yes, you see it but... - Not a sound. Did you arrange that? - No actually, it was that way when I found it. And I must say I am awfully pleased about it. - It's hard to imagine a study without the sound of falling rain. Do you ever listen to it? I do. When I'm at home, for hours. - No, I find it rather depressing. This place used to be a mad house some 50 years ago. Took me hours of research to find that out. I found the place quite by accident. - London is full of surprises. Many people are inspired by the sound of falling rain. Darwin, for instance. Have you read his latest book on earthworms? - Oh God, no! - You know, Jack. I feel as if this room were waiting for me. - Down there was the exercise room for women of the upper middle classes. A nut hatch, a loony bin? - A lovely thought. - Yes, isn't it? Staircase is my own addition. Why don't we go down? - No! I think I ought to be going now. I am sure the storm must be almost over. - I assure you these storms last 34 minutes at the very least. We have plenty of time. - Isn't science an extraordinary thing? - Oh really? Why don't you go down? - I hardly dare. It's so dark down there. - Watch! (soft music) Another one of my improvements. - What won't you think of next? - It's the new electricity thing. - Electricity? - Hmm! I've made many additions, but I think I've managed to preserve the original atmosphere, don't you think? - Clever of you to pad the walls. - Oh, that's original. The cloth was my own idea. - Oh! - Gainsborough. - Oh! Prepare. - I find I need the space for my purpose. It's more comfortable. - What's in there? - Photographic equipment. Must stay away, it has to be kept clean. Some of my pictures are over there on the table. - Oh, Jack! They're lovely. May I? - Oh, please do. (soft music) - You know, even when I first met you at Lady Bunt's, you were always tinkering. Repairing her mechanical link figure, I think, or whatever it was. Is this your gymnasium setup, Jack? - Well, I do do some exercise from time to time. I find it relates to my larger purpose. - What might that be, Jack? - Your violation, my dear. - My what? - The surrender to me of your maidenhead. - You must be mad to speak like this to me. - I've waited one whole long year for this moment. You amused yourself with my heart. And now it is my turn to amuse myself with your body. - You forget yourself. Be so good as to consider our friendship suspended, until you have suitably apologized for your shocking lapse of taste. Meanwhile, I will only trouble you to call a cab, so that I might remove myself from your hateful presence. - I might warn you that your screams and cries for help will not be heard. You will depart from here when I choose to let you go. - How dare you? Am I a child that you're going to speak to me like this? - No! No! You're a lusciously lovely girl. Possessing everything I desire, and able to satisfy my fondest dream. - How dare you? - I give you two alternatives. - You give me what? - And only two. Either you submit quietly, or do you prefer force? - (gasps) You're mad. - Oh, I wouldn't say that. You have three minutes. If by the time the clock chimes the half hour you have not consented to submit, then I shall have no other alternative than to proceed to take you by force. Make the most of the last three minutes, Alice. (clock chimes) Well, Alice? Which is it to be? Will you submit? - No! - As you please. But mark my words. Within the half hour, not only will you be offering yourself to me absolutely and unconditionally, but you will also be begging me to accept your surrender. - I defy you. (dramatic music) Jack! Please! Consider. You and I were to be married. - No one ever said marriage was a contract with no strings attached. - For God's sakes, Jack, get hold of yourself. We're both grown man and woman. - And what a woman you are. - Jack! This is madness. (ominous music) - You are going to be stripped naked. Completely and utterly naked. - No! Jack, please. No! - There is one detail that remains. If I let you loose, will you remove your clothes quietly? Or must I remove them, one by one? (indistinguishable dialogue) - You had your innings at my cost. And now, it is my turn to have mine at yours. - Please, don't do it, Jack. Let me go. Let me go. - But you are delicious. And I'm trying to imagine what you'll be like with your clothes taken off. - Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Please. Don't! No! - Delicious. - Jack! - You're so delicious. - No. My hat! (yells) - Magnificent. - [Alice] No! - The Himalayas. Well, Alice? Which is it to be? - Please, Jack. Don't undress me. Have me as I am. - It's not good enough. You must be naked. - Have pity on me, Jack. I'll be so quiet. - I said it's not good enough. - But you don't understand how I feel. - I think I'm beginning to understand very well. - This is low, Jack. - Low? How can you say that? No, no. I'm not letting you go. And now, the drawers. - No! Anything. But please, not the drawers. (dramatic music) - As magnificent as a Ponticelli. You're not listening, are you, Alice? - I have a pain in my shoulder. - Women! In Timbuktu, the natives eat their captives whilst the flesh is still quivering. They just warm it up in the fire. How do you like that? A little cannibalism. Oh, I could fancy you for tea. Cream. And sugar. Oh, how thoughtless of me for not including you in on this magnificent spectacle for my dear little kumquat. Hold on. - How can you debase me in this manner, Jack? - No trouble at all. I simply pulled the lever. But enough of this silly banter. Let's get down to business. - [Alice] No! No! No, Jack. - Calm down, Alice. It's no use. I could fancy a whole room full of women hanging up just as you are now. Like carcasses in a butcher shop. I'm shortly going to ask you a question, and I want you to answer honestly and directly. If you fail to answer, I might draw your attention to this whip here. If you fail to answer, I shall have to apply it to you. How old are you? - 25. - [Jack] Good. Are you a virgin? - Yes. - Absolutely, a pure virgin? I said, absolutely a pure virgin? I include female as well as male in my inquiry. No other hands but mine? No other eyes but mine? - How can you talk to me like this? - Why not? I only wanted to find out how much you knew, so that I might know what to teach you. Ms. Alice, allow me to introduce John Thomas. John Thomas, Ms. Alice Porter. Should John Thomas assume by your indifference that you have in your time met so many John Thomases, that his sight no longer appeals to you? Do you not wonder whether or not John Thomas will fit into your holy of holies? (gentle music) - No! No! (sobbing) Don't! Make it stop. - Steady, Alice. But this will take the weight off your arms. (soft moaning) - I'm spinning. (whirring) Oh no! Jack! What other manners of torture lurk in this room? - Steady now, Alice. - Please. Don't, Jack! - Think a moment, Alice. Larger things have come out than what is about to go in. - Please! Don't. (screams) (groans) - Oh! Paradise! Did I hurt you? - At first. But not afterwards. - Good girl. And now? (gentle music) Now, you will be rewarded. (moaning) - Alice. This is the moment we have been waiting for. - The what? - Surrender to me your maidenhead. - No, not that. No! - What? Must I use violence? I might tie you up again. - Can you be gently then? - Gently? Gently? No, there must be-- - No! - Violence! The taking of a maidenhead. That primal moment. The thrust. The breaking. On! Alice! Your shuddering thighs resist me. No! Wait a moment. (soft music) Well, Alice, this is the moment you become a woman. Well, not completely but this is the turning point. Hold still, Alice. Alice, this is my first photographic picture of a maidenhead. Thank you. That one is exquisite, my dear. Exquisite. Not a flaw. Lips like scallop thread. Like a pomegranate cut open. Open to me my dearest lips. For my head is drenched with dew and awaits the moisture of your night. And now... (gasps) Paradise, lost. - Jack! - Yes, Alice. - We haven't... I didn't. Please, don't leave me like this. - Do you want a chocolate? - Could have thought of that before. - If one were wise, one would lead life only by inexperience. That is what makes it so unexpected and delightful. Never to realize, that is the true ideal. - You still have something left. I can see it. - Hands off. I'm saving that for another occasion. (soft music) - This is cruel. - But why, I'm not touching you. - I know. Come on. - Beg. - Please! - No. Frankly, now you're not a virgin, I'm not really interested. - You always get what you want. - I plan ahead. - Back! The things one does to pass the time. Where are our poets and our novelists? - Jack, I'm randy. (moaning) - Didn't I tell you? Mark my words. Within the half hour, not only will you be offering yourself to me completely and unconditionally, but you would also be begging me to accept your surrender. You see, you can't beat a man with a plan. (gentle music) - Now, as I remember that afternoon, it is hard for me to believe how quickly I changed from an innocent young maiden, to a worldly, and ever so slightly, debauched, young sophisticate. A woman of the world, if you will. I have often thought that there must have been an element of lust in my blood. A latent desire for erotic fulfillment. Which Jack had awakened rather than created. I might have preferred a gentler awakening, but that little matters now. As reluctant as I may have been in that first encounter, it is how willing I was in our next. (soft music) It was two weeks later, and I had brought Molly, my lady's maid, for a brief visit. This is the marvelous room I was telling you about, Molly. - It's queer. - It is a funny room. - What are those, the old place is full. - We don't quite know. I think they're probably one of Mr. Jack's photographic work. - What's that? - Probably one of Jack's silly inventions. - Looks like a stalks to me. - That's not a stalks, girl. - Mr. Jack, you gave me a stop. Didn't see you come out of there. - It's a photographic brace. You see, in photography, when one wants to take a photograph, one must keep perfectly still, not move a muscle. Otherwise, the picture is ruined. - I can't do that, not even for a minute. I'll wiggle all about. Me mother says, I got ants in me pants. - Ants in your pants, you say? - It's what she says, sir. - So, why don't you try the brace, Molly? - It's time for us to go now, Jack. Thanks ever so for the photograph. Come along, Molly. - I saw that. - What? - Saw you taking the chocolates. (ominous music) - Oh, Molly. How bad. - And now you're going to be punished. - Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. No! - What was Molly thinking? - Out of here. - Well done, Jack. - You are not master at Excelsior. - Yes. Now you need a lesson. - I'll have the law on you. - The law not only permits the spankings of wicked servants, but it also encourages it. - I'm gonna report you to the school authorities. - They dispense the same kind of punishment by the hour. - Mr. Jack, please, let me go. I promise, I'll stay and do nothing. - The sooner you realize how helpless you really are... - By God, you devil! I'll make it out for the pair of you. - And submit. - Submit? - Submit? - Yes. The sooner it will be over. - You're daft. - But if you should resist, you will have a long doing. - Me? - Of a bad time. Now, if I release you, will you take your clothes off, or must I take them off for you? - Jack! May I undress her? - Why not, my dear? After all she's your maid and property so to speak. - Thanks so much, darling. Sit there and watch, while I undress her. - Don't, Miss. Please. Oh cock whammy, stop it, sir. - Oh, steady, Molly, steady. - Oh. Oh, Ms. Alice. Don't strip me naked, please. - Steady, Molly, steady. - No! (sobbing) No! Jack, no! - Come on, Molly. - Alice! Stop! Stop! - Oh, steady, Molly. It's not gonna hurt. - Oh, you can't do this. (dramatic music) No! (screaming) - Jack! Isn't she lovely? Such skin. I've never touched a woman's breasts or gunny before. Except of course my own. Watch me carefully, darling. And if I don't do it properly, tell me. (upbeat music) - Oh, blimey. - Yeah. How lovely. How delicious. How sweet. - Don't, miss. Please. Oh, Mr. Jack! How filthy. Playing with your Hampten wicker like that? Oh, take your hands away Ms. Alice. (gasps) - Oh, Molly! What's this? - Don't tell, Mr. Jack. Please, miss. - Oh, Molly. - Please! - Jack! She's been had by someone. My finger went right in. - What? A woman without a maidenhead? Alice, how could you? It's as if a part of her were missing. - Part of me is missing. - But we know where that went. My God! This magnificent experience was had by a member of the lower classes. By one of her usual associates. (screaming) By God knows who. - He wasn't that bad. - How would you know? You could have had it done by me, by me. How do I know she wouldn't give me some disgusting disease? She might not even be clean. - No, Jack-- - In fact, she isn't. - Jack, I found something that might interest you about poor Molly. - I'm not interested in anything about Molly. Take her away. - No! - You're whispering. - Very well then. Let her rest a bit, and whilst she's recovering, why don't you remove all your clothes. For something tells me in your eye that you'll be wanting something before... - I want something now, darling. - Now, Molly. When did this little slip happen? -I was 17, sir. I was drugged, honest I was, sir. Let me go, sir. And I'll come to you whenever you wish. I'll let you do whatever you want. Please. I'm afraid of Ms. Alice. She seems so strange. Oh my God! (dramatic music) She's naked. - My complements, Mademoiselle. - Merci, monsieur. Why don't you go and get ready, Jack? Ms. Feltby wants to meet you presently. (speaking foreign language) (gentle music) Molly! You shall love me. (moaning) (moaning) - Steady, Alice. I think she's had as much as she can stand. (dramatic music) - Of course. Letting me wear them. Am I supposed dressed? - Undressed, Molly. Now, Molly, I want you to confess. How you were given the nickname, Birdie. - Where's Ms. Alice? - Oh, she'll be joining us shortly. Don't you worry. Now, is it not true that you were given the nickname, Birdie, by some of the servants? Because of the bizarre acts you performed with Edward Bowles, Ms. Alice's gardener. - You're daft. - Not so, Molly. Is it not true that you took this part in your mouth, hence the nickname, Birdie? - A vicious rumor and lie. - Not so, Molly. If you persist in lying, I should have to use this whip on you until you come clean. Now, out with it. - I'll confess, sir. Let me go, I'll confess. -Soitis true? You did perform this bizarre act. You've been a very good girl for telling the truth. - Thank you, sir. Now, will you let me go, sir? - Not just yet, for I have doubts about this rumor myself. The rumor says that you were able to take all this and this too. Now, I'm going to ask you in the name of science and discovery, to enact the same deed with me here. For itis a feat, if you'll pardon my saying, I find difficult to swallow. You may commence at once. - I can't, sir. - Why not, Molly? - Not with you, sir? - Not with me? - Only with Eddie. Eddie was me first and only true love, Eddie was. - What a strange puritan you are. - Well, I can't, sir. I can't. Oh, God. - What's that, Molly? - I can't say it, sir. (moans) - Yes, Molly. (moans) Is something the matter, Molly? - Something's driving me wild. (moans) (upbeat music) - By jove, she ate the whole thing. Now Alice, hold on to her while I remove her. Now Molly, you denied me the pleasure of your maidenhead lost. Now you will surrender to me, the maidenhead of your ass. Thrust whole. (moaning) (dramatic music) - That second encounter put an end to whatever vision I may have had of myself as an innocent, young lass. I accepted my own lustfulness. Indeed, I embraced this newly found sexuality. I set aside my reluctance in caressing another woman. And now, my willingness was replaced with a total eagerness for such exciting adventure. This was particularly so, because our next opportunity was to include an encounter with Lady Bunt. A pompous, pretentious woman of questionable nobility and dubious morality. It was not her lack of morals which I found objectionable. I was scarcely in a position to pass judgment on that. But her total hypocrisy. She pretended to great propriety and perfect breeding. But we all knew her to be superficial and selfish. Her manners were as affected as her morals. She was the sort of woman who may fool men with her coarse flirtation, but who is quite transparent to other women. We were all invited to afternoon tea at Jack's. I must say that it was with a certain relish that I anticipated seeing her in her naked reality, so to speak. - Under my bed. - Oh really? - Oh, yes! But my bed's not nearly large enough. - Cecily! Would you care for some tea, Lady Bunt? - No, no tea. Thank you, dear Jack. We just had tea at the Duchess of Berg's. Such bad tea too. Really quite undrinkable. But perhaps, Cecily will have some. Oh, what comfortable chairs you men do get about to. You bachelors do study your feature compass, and as so remain bachelors. - Oh, will you my dear? - Oh, an offer of tea? Dare I, mommy? - Of course you may, my dear. After all, mommy is chaperoning. - Cream and sugar? - Yes, thank you. - Mind, he hasn't put any cantharides in it. - Alice! - Perhaps your ladyship would care to try it first, just to make sure. - Oh, but my dear. Never trust a man who lives alone. That's always been my motto. - Surely, there's nothing here more treacherous than your thoughts. - My thoughts? Whatever could you know about those, Alice? A girl like you? (laughs) Let me tell you something. I have found that the best remedy for thoughts iS exercise. But please, as a concession to my poor wits, explain to me what you really mean. - I think perhaps she had better not. Nowadays, to be intelligible is to be found out. I, for one, would rather delight in the vision of two angels. - That was a lovely complement, wasn't it, Cecily? - Yes, mommy. - Oh! Jack, what are these nasty pulleys doing down? They're not at all pretty and they're hovered in the way. - They form part of my gymnasium setup, your ladyship. I couldn't be without it. - Well, how do they work? And what are these loops up here for? You know I'm a dud in gymnastics, really I am, but I've never seen this sort of arrangement before. - What an elaborate setup. - Yes, you're quite right, Cecily. Quite right. - The loops form bracelets, you see. Here we are, let me show you. Now, grasp the rope with the hands, thus dividing the weight between the hands and the wrist. Not as in a trapeze, where the weight is taken by the fingers. - Oh! How very clever. Do you use this with your students? - Dare infer that I invite my students home to play with my equipment. - Afraid of a little buggery in the snuggery, Jack? - Ms. Alice, please. Let me try, Jack. Ms. Alice, fasten me. - Oh! Not bad for an old girl that, was it? (dramatic music) Cecily takes after me. - Oh mother, how jolly! - I know. But I can't keep it up much longer, I'm afraid my dear. I'm not as young as you are. Set me loose, Jack. - Not just yet, Lady Margaret. Alice and I are going to have some fun with you and Cecily first. - I don't follow you at all. Loose us both at once. I don't mind a joke in the least but you go too far, sir. - Perhaps this will help your ladyship understand our ideas. (screaming) - Stop, stop! - How dare you? Stop this immediately, I demand it. Stop, stop! - But you're beautiful, dear lady. If the rest of you is like what I have just discovered, then a banquet awaits us. Molly, Molly, quick. Undress Lady Bunt. - Who is this woman? Where did she come from, Jack? - Ms. Alice's maid. - Well, I won't have her doing this. Stop her immediately. Do you understand me? I said stop her immediately. - Oh, mother. Help, help! - And you're a headmaster. I'll have you reported, you realize that? I will exposure you for your actions. For God's sake, Jack. Don't strip me naked. Cover me up. Cover me up. - And you matter. Are you anything like mommy? - Oh don't! Please don't. - Now girls, slip off Cecily's drawers. - [Alice] Quick, Molly. Give me a hand. - Good. Now each of you take command of a cheek of her bottom. Cecily, I'm going to amuse yourself with your mother. I want you to watch intently. - Don't touch me. - If you should avert your eyes for even a second, for whatever the reason, I shall command Alice and Molly to give you a pinching that you will never forget. Now be careful. (moaning) - Mother, oh mother. - Well, I think that will suffice for present. - What did you feel? - Gloriously ripe, my dears. And the biggest quim I've ever come across. God, how I wish I were the man that took her maidenhead. - Jack, I swear you're obsessed with taking of maidenheads. - Oh, I truly love to get them, I truly do. And Cecily. - I think she's intact. - Superlative. - Can we undress her, sir? - Sh, not so loud, Molly. Yes, certainly, go on. - Oh no! Oh mother, they're going to undress me. - Oh, for pity's sake, Jack. Do anything you like to me but spare my child. - Steady, Cecily, steady. And there you go. - For God's sake, Jack, stop them. - No, no, Lady Margaret. Cecily must contribute her share to the afternoon's entertainment. - [Lady Bunt] Oh my God. - Oh! Mama! Mama! - I'm sorry, my darling. I simply can't help you. How can you be so cruel? - I have no doubt that Lady Margaret and Cecily would prefer to be left alone for a few moments. So let us go and undress. - Oh mother, what are they going to do with us? - I can only guess. They going out to undress makes me think that you and I will have to satisfy their lust. I'm afraid that they will violate you and outrage me. Then they will turn us over to the girls, and Cecily my dear, I'm afraid that girls can be very cruel to their own sex. (moaning) - Mother. - Child. - Stop, darling. - Oh, mama. (whirring) (moaning) Now Alice, you fasten her arms and Birdie, you get hold of her legs. - I thought her name was Molly. - We call her Birdie. - This is no time to quibble about names. For God's sake. - Calm down. - This is outrageous. If my husband ever hears of this... (yells) - Now girls, unfasten Cecily and tie her to me on the chair of treachery. (moaning) (screaming) - Mama! Mama! - I'm so sorry. - Now Alice, over there. Open the box of imagining tortures. (moaning) - Don't come near me with those things. I said, don't you dare? (screaming) Do you know who I am? I'm Lady Bunt. - Your vanity towards... - Bunty, spread your legs. (moaning) (screaming) - Oh my golly! For God's sake, Jack, stop them. They're Killing her. - Gently. Gently. Alice, gently dears. You're driving her mad. (moaning) - No, jack. - Oh, I congratulate you, your ladyship. Your daughter is a virgin. And as I haven't had a virgin in such a long time, I'm all the more obliged to, for allowing me this opportunity to take sweet Cecily's maidenhead. - Oh, you shan't have me. You coward. I am ripped. - What a naughty temper you have, Cecily. - Oh mother, dear. - Alice, quick, get the feathers. That will cure her. (sobbing) - Stop this, Alice. Stop this, Alice. Do it, stop. Oh my God, I can't stand it Ms. Alice, stop. I'll be good. Jack, I'll do anything you like. - Alice, stop for a moment. Now Cecily, there must be no mistake. You must be willing to do anything I may tell you to do. Whether it be to yourself or to anyone else in this room. You understand? - Yes, Jack. - Good. Alice, Molly, unfasten one-half of Lady Bunt. One arm and one leg. And then all of you pleasure yourselves. (moaning) (dramatic music) Now Cecily, I'm going to teach you the art of peaking. (moaning) I shall strip you thusly. Now you stroke me. (moaning) Oh yes, Cecily. That's it, Cecily. (moaning) - Let go of me. Let go of me. (moaning) Let go of me. - Now, Alice, Molly, unfasten Cecily. She's learning properly. Now Cecily, I want you to do the same to your mother. - No, I couldn't! - No! - It's too horrible. - Now Cecily, if you do not keep your promise, I will tie you to your mother and spank your bottom so hard that your movements will make her spin. - Oh mother, what shall I do? - Come, darling. - Now, my little pet. Randy mommy. (dramatic music) That's it, Cecily. Get on top of her. Continue, Lady Bunt. Cecily, go down on mommy. (moaning) - Oh, mother! - Child. - Now get on top. Unfasten Lady Bunt and tie her to the chair of treachery. (dramatic music) - As I watched the little orgy we had staged, my thoughts suddenly took a darker turn. I realized that Jack was not just awakening our sensuality, rather, he was using us. All of us to satisfy his own animal desires. And with that knowledge came the realization that I would have to have some sort of revenge. Not simple, emotional revenge, but something elegant, complicated. (screaming) My plan would eventually involve three of Jack's students, as well as the women who Jack had so callously used as sexual objects. But before we see how well my little plan works, let me assure you that I am not by nature a petty or vengeful person. It is just that we Victorian women have a keen sense of poetic justice. And after all, it's not so nice to be hung from the ceiling. What an erotic tableau. - A masterpiece of inventiveness, my dear. - Jack. - Yes, Alice. - I'd awfully like to know one thing. - Yes. What might that be? - When you tied me up on that fateful afternoon, did it give you pleasure? - Oh, yes! Of course. The sight of your agony gave me intense pleasure. - Would you think it awful of me if I asked to play the same game with you? - What on earth do you mean? - I fasten you to the ropes, and tie you up, and give you pleasure in my own way. - Well, that's a divine idea. Yes. Let's. - Off with the gowns. - Oh no, no. Anything. Anything but not the gowns. - Off. - Oh go, blimey. Blimey, sir. No, don't tie me up, sir. Anything. Anything, but not this. - Submit. You know your screams and cries for help will not be heard in here, my dear. - Desist this madness. Oh please, let me go, miss. I'll let the law on you. - You need a lesson, Jack. - Let me loose at once. I don't mind a joke in the least but you go too far, sir. - Perhaps this will help you to understand my idea, your ladyship. - Oh! Please, don't. - I will let you go. Only after I have ravished you, my darling. - Please, have pity on me and have me as I am. Molly, how did... Lady Bunt, what are you... What are you both doing in... What is the meaning of this? Cecily, what are you doing here? Now Alice, what is the meaning of this? Let me down at once. I demand an instant explanation. What, have you all lost your tongues? Answer me. I demand an instant explanation. It isn't that I'm not pleased to see all of you ladies. It's just that I'm no position to be able to do you justice. Now, answer me. What is the meaning of this? - Wasn't he sweet, when he said to us that those ropes were just for gymnastics? - And his lovely chair of treachery. - But I was teaching you. I taught you all. - Try to relax, Jack. I think we know what to do. - Relax? - Girls, you should have heard him. My maidenhead was a flower, a dear little flower. - Alice, please don't-- - Oh, yes! Such a lovely cock, and so small now. Oh, and then I was a what? A lemon. - A kumquat. - Oh yes, and then an oyster. - Lovely. - What a poetic imagination, I suppose. - I never knew you were a poet, Jack. - I'm not. Now, come along, girls. Come close and I'll have you one by one. Hazely, Peters, Prince Sackway. (dramatic music) For God's sake, who gave you permission-- - I did. You had your folly with us, dear Jack. It's time you got your just due. - Whatever do you mean? - Exactly what I said. - Alice, this is disgraceful. They are my students. - I invited them to join and witness in the partaking of your maidenhead. - Are you mad? I possess no maidenhead. - You do, sir, and it's peaking at me right now. - Peters, how dare you speak to me like that? - Steady, sir. - I'm sorry, sir. I suppose it isn't really cricket. - What you have just said could cost you 1000 lines. - You forget your position, sir. Thank you, miss. That's quite a relief. It hurts when it's all pent up inside. - Oh my God! - Now, I'm sure, sir, you haven't forgotten all the canings, the floggings you gave all us boys in class. But in case you have, here's a reminder from the entire class. - Hold still. - This is your moment, Jack. The moment you've been waiting for. The moment you become a man. - Let me go. - Perhaps not all at once. But this is the turning point. (grunting) - Now, let yourself go. (grunting) - My first photographic picture of a maidenhead.
