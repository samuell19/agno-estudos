Run. Go. Come on, over here. Get up! - I can't. - Get up, we have to! - I can't. - Come on, you have to. Come on, get up! Go, go, go! Go! Keep moving. Come on! - That's it! - Damn. I can't run anymore. I'm tired. - Hey, we gotta get, we've gotta get movin', okay, come on. - Why are we running? There's no one out here but us. - We gotta go. The car's gotta be somewhere around here. - Oh, you're telling me you lost the car? - Look, just keep moving, all right, please. - We're lost. - We're not lost. - We've been running around like idiots! - We're not lost, okay. What the hell was that? - What was that? - Look, baby, hey, look, trust me, okay? We gotta move now, okay? - No, I'm tired. - The stuff in this bag, okay, it's gonna keep us set for a long time, all right? - What stuff? Check this out. - Who's there? - And that concludes the summary of the estate. The distribution is remarkably simple. Cash, bonds, stocks, and trust funds listed in appendix D go to Phillip and Emily. It's the bulk of the liquid assets. This house and the trust funds to maintain it, appendix F, go to Jack, Ray, and Elizabeth, jointly. Charles will remain here, on staff, as long as he chooses to. - Thank you, sir. - Well, thank you, Mr. McClain, for everything. My wife and I appreciate it. - Mr. Naibert, will you please take a seat? Now there is just one little point I need to add. Ms. Naibert was very saddened that her three grandchildren never visited her here. So the surviving children of Philip and Emily Naibert must spend a two-day weekend in this house, Saturday afternoon to Monday morning. - Oh man, this is a crock! - Jack, please! - The next weekend I'm available is Christmas vacation. Ray, what about you? - No, no, no, no, Jack, Jack. Rebecca was very specific here. It must be the first complete weekend after her death. - So, uh, when should we be here? Saturday afternoon? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No parental supervision, you and Emily may not stay during this particular weekend. - No parental supervision? Yeah, right. We're gonna have our own lawyers challenge that one. Come on, Emily, hmm? - I wouldn't do that, Mr. Naibert. - Philip, please, it doesn't matter. Sit. - Mr. Naibert, lawyers have specialties. And my specialty is wills and trusts. And this one's iron-clad. So if you lift one finger to break this will, you will lose everything. - Point of order, my wife and I are rightful heirs to this kingdom, and we can't be banished from it. Right, honey? - Philip, please, darling, it doesn't matter. - Dad, it's just a weekend. - Hey, look, Grandma was bonkers, all right. I'm sure it wouldn't be no, you know, trouble, proving she was a little bit, you know, upstairs. Jack, Jack, these are the psychiatric evaluations done, at Rebecca's request, only 10 weeks ago. - You thought of everything, didn't you? Well, think about this. I am going to have you disbarred. - There's also one single specific bequest. Your grandmother added this a week before she passed: To my only granddaughter, Elizabeth Naibert, a certain carved box and its contents, the oldest heirloom of our family. Preserve it for your descendants. - What is it? I don't know. She didn't show it to me, but this is the key. - Where's the box? - I suppose she wanted you to look for it. Happy hunting. Hey, Ray. Ray? Will you give me a hand, gettin' more wood? - Where's Charles? - I think he's off for the weekend. It'll only take a minute. Hey, sis, be right back. - Josh, goddammit! - Ah, the ever-lovely Countess de Naibert. - You idiots, this'll ruin everything. - Just relax. The lawyer didn't say anything about not having guests. - I'll bet this was your idea. - Just a neighborhood inheritance bash. Right, Jack? - Oh, I'm Cyndy. Josh said it'd be okay if I came. Jack, where's the pool. - Out this way. - Ray, would you be a peach? Thanks. - I'll got this. - Thank you, baby. - There you go. - Lizzie. - This was just supposed to be family. - What's the big deal? They just came to help us celebrate. - Grandmother has been dead just a week. - Yeah, and we're alive. So we can have a great night, with a house all to ourselves. Come on. - Okay. * Oh - Ray, one time. I go first. - No, best of- - Oh, 'cause I was lookin' at her, you thought I was, oh! Are you sure you wanna just, um, play? Sure, that's fine. - Okay, yeah, you're good. You're good. - Can't believe how beautiful this house is. - It's amazing. It's all mine. - You have lipstick right here. - Let's get serious, man. Where was I? - You're too much, man. - You're grandmother must have been wonderful. - Yeah, she was... I, honestly, I really didn't know her that well. - What's up with Zorro? - That's just, uh, a new fad she's got into, lately. It's called penning the subconscious. - What did you just call me? Your what? Your baby? - No. - Baby? I love it. * Which way What's up? - Couldn't get her to say one word. You want me to call psych unit? - No, that's all right. I'll, uh, see if I can talk to her. Ted Williams said don't ever look into the sun when you're up at the plate. Makes it hard to see that little white ball. I'm Detective Sanders, by the way. - Elizabeth. - Elizabeth Naibert, you're family, aren't you? - Found some foreign substance on her wounds. - Well, just take that back to the lab, all right. Just leave us alone here, for a minute, okay? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Well, looks like you made it through this weekend escapade at the funhouse here. You called the cops, didn't you? Ms. Naibert? You all right? Elizabeth, can you hear me? Are you all right, Ms. Naibert? Ms. Naibert? - I'm fine, Detective. - Elizabeth, do you mind if I call you Liz? Elizabeth's too many syllables for an old five-and-dimer like me, Elizabeth. I promise I won't call you Lizzie. Nobody likes to be called Lizzie, except maybe Lizzie McGuire or Lizzie Borden. Do you know who Lizzie Borden was? - No. - She chopped many a fine skull with a big Mohawk ax, just like a watermelon. Okay, how you doing? Okay? - I'm fine, Detective. - Okay. We're gonna continue our interview with Ms. Elizabeth Naibert. I'm Detective Sanders, and you remember my fellow gumshoe here, Fast Eddie Doyle, well-manicured, well-quaffed, spit-shined, and well-behaved, at times. I'm just a shaggy old dog with bad feet. Now this is not a good cop/bad cop situation. This is a bad cop/bad cop situation. In fact, I'm real bad. I'm the worst. - Yeah, but I'm workin' on it. - So let's continue, if you don't mind, Liz, and starting over, let's say, with the reading of the will. - I know you remember everything I told you, in detail. See, a lot of times, it doesn't always register in this old brain of mine, you know? Maybe you'd run it by us again. - You want to find out if I can tell the same story twice? - Liz, nobody in the world can tell the same story, exactly the same way, twice. You now, things get left out, sometimes, a you know, a comma here or there misplaced, so indulge me a little. - Okay. We were all excited about coming out for the weekend. Even Jack got up for it. I guess I stayed with everybody just to get them off my back. Cyndy brought a boom box. And Josh brought a carload of beer. There was no escaping it. No drugs? - No. - No mescaline, reefer? - No. - Mushrooms? - No. - None of the above? - No. - How 'bout acid? No. - Okay. - Where you goin'? - You know what? I'm getting cold. Let's go inside. - No, no, no, no, it's warm in here. - You want warm? - Yeah, I want warm. - I'll give you warm. - Really? Well, why don't you go up to the bedroom? And you get ready. I'm gonna do a couple of laps, and I'll be up there in five minutes. - Why don't you take your time, because I brought a vibrator? - Oh. - Ah! - Can't wait for five minutes for me? - I can, but, um, I don't wear out like some people I know. - That, that was one time, and I had a lot to drink. - Uh-huh, sure. - I was on medication. - Let's go inside. - Hey, sis, where you going? Oh, I'm tired. I think I'm just gonna go to bed. - Yeah? You want to go? - You guys goin' too? All right, yeah. * Habits make you drive in patterns, yeah * - Oh, baby, it's cold out there! - Oh, but it is warm here. It is warm in here. That's right, 'cause I made the fire. You remember that? - Oh, baby, yeah. You made the... Oh, you did a good job. - Yeah, I thought this, it's very obvious. - Come here, come here. Get close to the fire. - Actually, you know what? I'm going upstairs, to get out of these wet clothes, and get ready for Josh, so I'll see you guys later! - Okay. She's so cute. * I already miss you * But you are not yet gone * I wish I could kiss you * But you're not coming home - You're so beautiful. - Oh. - When we get married, you'll be my trophy wife. - Don't you have to be middle-aged to be one, though. - Nah! - Huh? - Nah, no. - No? - Uh-uh. - Well. Um- - What? - Did you bring the condoms? - Me? I thought you were. - Mm-mm. - Hmm. - No, I guess we're just gonna have to go with the flow. I guess so. * No - I like this place. It's made for stories. - How did I get to be with such a bohemian like you. - You're just lucky, I guess. Hey! I saw something in the mirror. There's somebody standing out on that ledge. - Baby, Josh is always pulling practical jokes. He's just joking around. Come on. To my only granddaughter, since I'm not here to teach you the meaning of these things, you will have to discover them for yourself. The others will never understand the truth. Always remember that you are a Naibert, and our line extends back for centuries. Your grandmother, Rebecca. Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh, Josh! What's wrong? What's wrong? - Are you okay, Josh? What happened? Are you okay? Josh! - What happened? - What happened? - Josh, Josh, Josh. - Josh, Josh. Josh. - Josh. - Josh, Josh, Josh. - Oh my God, Josh. - Look, look. - Josh. - Who? Who? Look at me. - I am. - Look. Are you okay? - Yeah. He's fine. There's nothin' in the pool. - Jesus Christ, man. You just scared the shit out of me. - And I wasn't actually sure that I had seen someone in the window. It just happened so fast. - Well, why didn't you tell us about this before? - What before? I was comin' down the stairs, and I heard Josh yell from the pool, so I went down to help. - There was something in the pool. - Sure, Josh. - Hey, Ray, fuck off. - All right, listen, each of you guys saw somethin' no one else saw. I've been seeing some things in the mirrors that we're there. - I did, too. I saw something that was black, and I couldn't tell what it was. - I don't know about the rest of you guys, but this is all really giving me the creeps. Yeah. - I found the box. - Really? - Where is it? - It's in the library. I'll go get it. - What box? - Just somethin' that our grandmother gave Liz, probably some jewelry or somethin'. - We're supposed to have an ancestor who signed the Magna Carta. - Her note was rather odd. - This is odd? - Read it. - "Dear Elizabeth, these things have been in our family for centuries. I hope you enjoy them as much as I have. Love, Rebecca." - This isn't the letter I got. - Are you saying that somebody switched the letters from inside a locked box? - I'm getting a really bad feeling from this. Jack, can you just lock up the box and get rid of it? You think I've lost my mind? - No, no, of course not. I don't think you're psychotic. I think you're lovely. But mass hysteria is different. I am not hysterical. - I can't listen to this crap anymore. - Okay. - You want some coffee? - Black, lots of sugar. - Yeah, I know. - Go ahead, let's get back on the track. - I hadn't described what I'd seen. Grandmother wouldn't have liked that, and I didn't want to cause anymore mass hysteria. Okay. Everybody split up. I thought they were all going to bed. I took the box with me. I can't believe this place is yours. Yeah, I know. You're rich. - You just want me for my money, huh? - Yeah. You know what? I'm glad that you're rich. But if I didn't want you for your body, I would be gone in a New York minute. Ray. What is that? - That's the tennis court. - Yeah, the tennis court. Do you want to come play? - We can't play a lot of tennis in the dark. - Well, who said anything about tennis? - Well. - Holy hell. The Naibert family is sure old enough to have a few skeletons in its closet, but this? - Tell me. Jack, the stuff in the box, it's no good, Jack. It's black magic. - Mandy, don't be silly, all right. It's just some museum pieces that my grandmother collected. - No, it's not, Jack. I want you to get rid of it. - I can't do that, all right, please. That's, that's Elizabeth's decision. - Baby. I'm afraid. - You okay? Are you sure you're okay? Mm. Mm, oh yeah. It looks like you got it, babe. Uh-huh. - What the fuck? Oh my, oh! I hope our kids get your eyelashes. - I hope they don't get my grandmother's courtyard. - Why? - It looks like a graveyard. - Oh, I think it's romantic. A lot of great stories must've happened right here. - I had a lot of really great tennis. Come here. You have a responsibility to this family, Elizabeth. My husband, Jerome, was a necessity to preserve my reputation. Be grateful you live in a more open-minded times. He must be intelligent, have a strong constitution and be born of a long-lived family. When he has served his term, you may discard him. - Do you hear that? - Yeah. - What is that? - I don't know. - What? - It's Josh. Josh! - Nice one, Josh. What is he doing? - Josh, now is not the time, dude. We're busy. - Keep talking like I'm here, okay. - Okay, okay, okay. Oh, Ray! Oh, yes! Oh, Ray! I love it when you do that. Oh, oh yes! I love it, you man! Oh, you stud! Ray! Oh Ray! - Gotcha! - Yes, Ray! Oh yes. - Come on, come on! Let's go! Come on, come on! - I think that we are getting better and better, every time. Do you think it's 'cause we're in love? - Mm, yeah, I do. Elizabeth, you're okay! - Of course I'm okay. What happened? - What, what, what, what was that? That was me, having another earthquake. - No, no, baby, baby, I'm serious. I'm serious. - And we saw, we saw the man that was looking in the window at Ray. - Yeah, he didn't look right. He didn't look right. - No, he was huge. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. - He was chasing us. - Is that Ray? You know, I think he's yelling for me. I gotta go downstairs. - No, you don't love me. - You're so cute when you pout. Mwuah! I gotta check this out. - Okay, well, come back, 'cause I'm gonna take a bubble bath, and I want you to come join me. - I will. And I do love you. - Okay. - Okay. * Who said that I wasn't right, wasn't right * * And I'll live for years without a light * * Without a light * Don't have a soul on my side - Jack? Jack? You scared the hell out of me. - I'm sorry. I was just looking for my makeup bag. Have you seen it anywhere? - Yeah, I put it on the bed out there. - Okay, thanks. Sorry. - It's okay. - So we ran, and, uh, I locked the door, and that's it, you know. What the fuck are you lookin' at? - So we got a prowler. - Are we sure that all the doors are locked? - Yeah, I checked all of them after everybody came in. - Isn't a whole fuck of a lot we can do, right? Plus, Ray's a big boy. He probably scared the guy away. Can we go to bed now? - He chased us. He's still out there. - Well, what can we do? Call the cops? It's gonna take hours for 'em to get here. - I'm goin' to bed, all right? Nighty-night. Where's Mandy and Cyndy? - She's, uh, keepin' my bed warm. - Mandy's upstairs, taking a bath. - Billy? Billy, I know you're out here. Billy? I know you're there. I got a doodle. Come on down, I got a doodle for ya. Here it is. Here it is. Those new people, Auntie Becca knows 'em. They're gonna go away. Can you understand that? They're gonna go away. Everything's gonna be like it was. I'll get the doodle for ya. But, uh, if they don't go away, no doodle. Do you hear me? No doodle. If you don't stay away from 'em, no doodle. That's the way it is, Billy. - All I need is a good lay, is that it, Josh's cure for everything? - Look, we're alive, and we're not in the Naibert family, thank God. So yes. Dr. Josh's hot beef injection is exactly what you need. Besides, comin' good and hard improves your 'tude. - What a sexist thing to say. - Hey. I had a rough day at the pool. I can use a little TLC. - Look at this. Wow, looks good on you. I found it in the drawer over there. - A Naibert sovenir? - I'm not taking it. I'm just wearing it. - Well, nobody's gonna miss it. She's dead, remember? - What were you doing in the pool? - I didn't make that up. I saw somethin'. - I believe you. - I know you do. Look. The old lady's voodoo stuff, Mandy wants it outta here, Jack, Ray, everyone, except maybe Elizabeth. So why don't we do everyone a favor and get rid of it? What do you mean get rid of it? - Look, I know a guy that would pay top dollar for this stuff. We'd make up a great story, say it's from- - Are you out of your mind? - Look, I could be gone. I could be, I could go to, go right now. Nobody's gonna miss it. I could be back by breakfast. - We're not stealing anything. - It's not stealing. Nobody's gonna miss this stuff, except maybe Elizabeth. - Forget it. I have a better idea. If I let you bang me, then will you forget it? - How many times? Pig. - I'm a pig? - Mm-hmm. - I'm a pig? - Mm-hmm. - Like that? I'm a pig like that? Josh! Josh! Hey, that's not my vibrator. - Oh, you don't like fruit? If I'm goin', you're goin' too, okay? Here, put this on. Do we have to? - Ray, Holly, come on! - This better be good, Jack. Yeah. - Mandy, baby, open the door. Baby, open the door, please. - Jack, what's up? - I don't know. Mandy's in here. The door's locked. She's taking a bath. She doesn't answer the door. She's not answering. - Hang on, hang on, hang on. Mandy? Mandy, it's Holly. You okay? Baby, open the door! - Mandy! - Well, the door is locked. - Look, I don't care about that, all right? - Did you guys rehearse that? It's cute. They're fuckin' with me. Cool, thanks, guys. - She's gone, man. We've gotta find her. Come on. Wow. - That's bizarre. Must've scared the hell out of everybody, huh? - Jack was completely freaked. Everybody else tried to act so blase. Ray was very protective. I knew I was safe with Ray around. - Yeah, and look what happened. - Excuse me. Edward, I don't mean to be unprofessional, but could ya get your shoe shined on your own time? Just listen, okay? - Okay. - It's just cop stuff here, go ahead. - Everybody split up to look for Mandy. I did too, for over an hour. I could still hear the others by the time I got back to my room. The others continued to look. I knew it was hopeless. My dear granddaughter, you must protect all the treasures. They're a sacred trust. You must never let anyone steal them or sell them or destroy them. Your life depends on it. Be careful of danger. Watch the others. Your grandmother, Rebecca. - I'm takin' the south wing. You guys hit the guest area, and then we're bound to find her, all right? - Jack. - What? - Look, we've been looking for her for half the night. We need the cops. - No, no, no cops, all right? - This is crazy. Ray, please. - Josh. Stay and help us, please. - I'm taking Cyndy outta here. Holly? - Oh, you're kidding? No, no, I want to stay here and help. - Look, Mandy's gotta be here, all right? Now we need your help, come on! - Okay, but if we can't find her, I'm gettin' the hell out of here, and I'm takin' Cyndy with me. - Where is she? - She's upstairs, in our room. - Josh? Josh, honey, is that you? Josh? - All right, look, here, I found this stuff. Now check it out. Some of this stuff goes back years, all right. You've got medical bills, medical reports, nursing homes, prescriptions. - "Done everything possible for your son Billy, any surgical intervention possible." Fernbrook Therapeutic Residence. - It's from a hospital lab. Probable chromosome abnormality. - And this is a bill from a speech therapist and prescriptions for Billy Naibert. - Listen to this. "I think you're makin' a mistake, as Billy is making progress. I know he wants to go home, but it isn't the best therapeutic environment for him." - Billy is our very own crazy Naibert family secret. - That's great. So we got some mongloid, half-retarded brother of yours, runnin' around outside? - He's got Mandy. I know he does. - I don't know if he has Mandy or not, but I do think that there must be some sort of rational explanation. - Rational explanation? We got monsters runnin' around outside. We got ghosts in the mirrors. Tell me, please, what the fuck is so rational about that, Holly? - Jack, calm down. - Shut the fuck up, Ray. - Whoa, guys, we're all under a lot of stress. I think if we can just relax and think about this. - We need to find him. - What, are you crazy? - I have this strange feeling he's more afraid of us than we are of him. - You are crazy. - Maybe he can give us some answers. - The only answer I want is where is Mandy. I will kill that son of a bitch if he took her. - Jack, listen to yourself. - That's it. I'm callin' the cops. - You're not calling the cops, Josh. - Back off! - She's alive. I'd go to hell to get her if I had to. - Look, I think we should get out of here while we still have the chance, okay? - Let's to look for Billy and get Mandy. * I'm captivated when you walk in the room * * There's somethin' so sexy about the way that you move * * Hesitation, let me breathe you in * * Your eyes, your lips, your hair, your skin * * I want to hear you, baby, callin' my name * * And sayin' those * I wanna feel you heart beatin' beneath my skin * * It's a mystery * Like the heavens above * It's a mystery * What makes - What? - How much more of this bullshit do you want me to listen to? - Listen, Eddie. If you didn't feed your addiction to interruption, we could get a lot more information out of this girl, because your preconceptions are both diverting and distracting to our witness. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - That means shut the fuck up, dodo! - This is the stupidest thing I have ever- - Hey, please, hey, man, just, just be cool, just let it ride, okay? - Fine, it's your show. - Thank you, dodo. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fast Eddie gets a little rambunctious. So going back now, what time was this? - I don't know, the middle of the night. We were all exhausted from searching, from all the strange things happening. It's gotta be a 100 feet from here to the ground. You won't find him. How do you know? You scared him away. - It smells like someone's sleeping in here. - It smells like someone died in here. Well, if he's in this house, we'll find the freak. - He's a relative. - What? He's our relative. Josh is right. You are nuts. I'll find him. - Cyndy! Baby, you decent? She's not in there. Fuck. - Oh my God. Don't. - Hello. - Dad, you have to come and get us. Are you all right? - No, we're not all right. Mandy's disappeared. - What, what, what happened? - She's, she's gone, all right. She's, she's gone. - What, Mandy? What is Mandy doing there? - I had some friends come out, Dad. - There's only supposed to be three of you there. What are, what, what are you talking about? - All right, look, she was in a locked bathroom, Dad, okay, and we had to break down the door, and she was gone. Well, she's probably snoring somewhere. That girl can really sleep. Have you looked? - At what? - It's Mandy. She's, she showed up. Now she's gone. They can't find her. - Oh my God. - Uh, we, we... Someone else is here. Ray and Holly saw him. - Look, the doctor gave your mother some sedatives. Now it's not right for me to just get up and go. So just calm down, will ya? Get, get it together. - Dad, are, are, are you fucking listening to me? - Hey, watch your language, young man. - Dad! - Look, you need to stay there. If you don't stay, we get nothing. You understand? Nothing. - I don't care, Dad. Look, I'm gonna be there Monday morning. - Dad, we might not be, we might all be dead in the morning. - Are you kids taking drugs? - Who's Billy? - Billy? We saw someone looking into the window. He was big. He was strong. And he was kind of retarded looking. - They found out. - Could he kill someone, Dad? - Is Elizabeth all right, Jack? - Go to hell, Dad! - Jack, let me talk. The line went dead. - That's kind of weird, huh? The phone picking that particular moment to cut out? - We didn't know what to do. There was a storm coming in, and my brothers wanted to see if they could find the broken phone line. Our cellphones didn't work out there. - Where do you think they usually put the electrical box in a place like this? - You're askin' the wrong guy. - This place is huge. - Yeah. Well, is it up there, somewhere or what? - Yeah, let's go look. It's cold out here, man. I know. - Put it on that little table and open it. Before the first cities of men, when ice covered the land, Grandmother took fires from the invaders, to keep the people alive. How they howled like wild dogs, forced to share the magic. The voice of the Sun God battled with me and buried my soul in the ice. And the deep dark powers give life to my reflections, because I dared all of you, ever an unknown, have I fought the evil that would exile from life, driven out at sword's point to starve like a dog. To the granddaughter, she gave secrets and the key. Keep the ancient blade and bear a daughter for a daughter so that life will burn in the reflections forever. Stronger than men, stronger than life itself, you will prosper and live until the end of eternity. - The entire place got colder, at that exact moment. - What do you mean? How? - I don't know, but we could just feel it. - The book is you, my granddaughter. But there is no room for sons or brothers. No, no, I can't! - Well, what do you think? - I don't know, let's try that gate over there. - All right, I hope so, hope you're right. I'm tired of looking. - Well, the electrical box has got to be in here. - I bet Grandma paid a fortune to bury the phone lines out to the, uh, the main road. Goddammit, Charles! Scared the hell out of me. - What are you doin' out here? - I served your grandmother for 19 years. You have no idea what's what. If you knew what was good for you, you'd get out of here and not come back. - Are you threatening us? - Haven't you got a lick of sense? Now listen to me and listen good. This place has been empty, outside of Ms. Naibert, for years. I talked to her once a month, for a minute or two. But I've seen things, and I ain't crazy. - What kind of things? - Keep your hands off everything. Be better for everyone if you do. - I think you better tell us what's going on. And if you know anything about my fiancee or about Cyndy, ya better tell us, right- - I haven't touched 'em. But Ms. Naibert has ideas. You better do what she wants. Don't say you haven't been warned. - Whoa, wait a minute. The phone's dead. - So what happened? - Jack and I had a little run in with Charles, out front. It was kind of strange, but, uh, he said that there's trouble and that Grandmother's at the bottom of it. - Grandmother's dead. And I think he's covering up for Billy. - We're gonna get out of here. Mandy, the freak outside, and now Cyndy, I mean, you may have to stay here, because your old lady's will, but I don't. Holly, you don't have to stay here. Come with me. We're goin' to the cops as soon as, as soon as we get a phone that connect to 911. - Maybe you could head back here, after you get the police, if all of us stay here and look for the girls. - They are not missing. They're dead. I mean, don't you get it? Not a sound, nothing. Nobody is out here but us. That brother of yours, the cousin, whatever he is, and now this Charles guy is making threatening noises, Jesus Christ, this house is a trap, and your grandmother's money is the cheese, and we are all gonna die like rats, picked off one by one. - Calm down, Josh. - Ray, wake up! I, I, I came out here to have fun with you guys. Now they're lost, and we're lost, and we're runnin' around, and nobody has a fuckin' clue what the fuck's goin' on. - Josh. - Holly, you don't have to stay here with these lunatics and get killed. - Maybe you should. - No. - Holly? - I don't know. - You're the one that's causing the trouble. Time to get rid of you. Come on. What the fuck? Fuckin' piece of shit! - That's when I told them Grandmother had been speaking to me. I'm not crazy. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. They looked at me like... I'm not crazy, Detective Sanders. You know I'm not! People disappearing into thin air, a dead woman telling you what to do, I mean you got to admit that's a little crazy. - The whole time out there was crazy, but I'm not crazy! You have to believe me! - All right, Liz, calm down. Stress can cause anybody to pop a cork. It's okay. I don't think you're crazy, okay. So what did your brothers do then? - Do it. - No, God, I can't. - Do it. Goddammit, do it. Fine, then I will. - Please, you can't do it! - You philistine, you! - Ray, throw them there, in the fire! - Please don't, don't! Throw it in the fire, Ray! No! - This whole thing has my sister going crazy. No, Ray, she isn't. - She's hearing voices in the mirrors. - She's just stressed. - Well, we're all stressed, Holly. Three people have vanished into thin air. My brother is going crazy. I'm not going crazy. I'm not hearing any voices. Not yet. - Maybe somebody's just trying to scare us off. - Yeah. Our retarded, closet-dwelling freak and a butler who's lived in solitary confinement for 20 years, if that's who's doing it, then they're doing a fucking kick-ass job. Where is everybody? And why would they kill three people over a house? There's no blood. There's no broken glass. Where are they? - I don't know. - Billy! It is not easy to bring it back from the fire. But it is not the first time. - What are you talking about? I cannot let men or other fools to spoil the work of centuries. - Leave me alone! - Jesus Christ, what was that? There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. Stop it. Just stop talking to yourself. Oh Christ, there's nothing to be afraid of. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a toilet. It's just a toilet! There's nothing wrong with the toilet. There's nothing to be afraid of, a toilet. Oh God, I'm losin' it. - Billy, I know you're in here. He must've heard us coming. - Billy good. Billy, come back! Billy! Oh, oh, Billy! - Fuck! - I saw you. Come out of there, come out. Oh, it's you. I told you all to get out of here and stay away. It's all happening. Ms. Becca told me. She's got ways. You better believe it. I seen 'em. What's that? - I've got to find my sister. - Yeah. - I don't want to kill anybody. I never wanted to kill anybody. - No one ever wants that, but destiny forces our hand. - All I have to do is kill myself, and the world will be safe from you. - This is crazy, Elizabeth. - I am crazy, aren't I? - My child, your life is not as bad as that. Come over. Come. - What's happened to you? - I'm so sorry, Raymond. But Grandmother's gift really can't be divided. I wish it were otherwise. But it's only for the granddaughter, only for me. Ray, please, Ray! Ray! Holly? Holly, are you okay? - Elizabeth? Is that you? Yeah, it's me. - Oh thank goodness that you're okay. Oh come here. It's just us. It's just us now. - No, Holly. It's just me. You must believe I never expected it, but I am the last of the Naiberts. - How could you? He's your brother. - You can't escape, Holly. Look into the mirror, Holly. You'll find Ray in the mirror, Holly. Ray loves you, Holly. I'll bring the two of you together. Just look into the mirror. Ray! No. No! I'm so sorry, Holly. - That is an amazing story, Elizabeth, amazing. It's unbelievable. Listen, will you, um, will you hold on for a second? I'll be right back, okay? - I can't believe they're putting her through all this. - Yeah, don't worry, honey. It shouldn't be much longer. - You are a brilliant young woman, Ms. Naibert. I just have a few questions before you go. One, how do you know how Josh got killed? Were you there? Did you see him get pulled apart? Or did somebody else see that for you and conveniently tell you? - Detective, I- - And what about pretty little Cyndy? How do you know she got her throat ripped out? - I just know. You just know. And let's not forget the butler who got shot in the head. No, no, no, let me guess. You just happen to know that, too, right? I was standing next to Detective Sanders, when your men carried the body out. - That is very clever, Ms. Naibert, just not clever enough. - Tell me, Detective, where are they? - Did you find out what really happened out there? Is my daughter all right? - Well, Mr. Naibert, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to place your daughter Elizabeth under psychiatric arrest. - Oh my God! - She didn't do anything. It was Billy. I know that. Well, somebody did somethin' wrong. I hope it wasn't her. It's no fun gettin' strapped into old sparky, for anybody. - Elizabeth is not insane, Detective. - Well, Mr. Naibert, your daughter is either the most profligate liar I've ever met, or she's stark-raving mad. Listen, uh, don't tell her about the others. There's a car waiting outside for Elizabeth and the both of you to go to the hospital. - Okay. Thank you. Is she gonna be okay? - Look, Elizabeth is going to be fine. What's gonna happen to her? - Look, what I need for you to do is take the car back home. Can you do that for us, please? Yeah. - Okay. What? - That poor retarded guy, he wouldn't know which end of the gun to hold. If only we could find that gun. She killed the old guy. I'll be damned if I can figure out why. - Maybe he saw something, and she needed to shut him up permanently. - Well, it's possible. Anything's possible. I'll tell ya one thing. It's a hell of a setup for an insanity plea, and here we are, sittin' in on the rehearsal. - Wait, wait, so, so, so let me ask you this. Who was the guy we took out on the stretcher? - You can't tell the players without a program. - What a bunch of crap. I mean, this whole thing was just a, just a whole goddamned waste of time. - Well, no, no, not if we get this case to trial, it's not. - Good evening, Ms. Naibert. - Mr. McClain, I recall asking you to never visit me here. - I appreciate that, but your grandmother had other trust funds that she never discussed with me. So I'll need to get your signature. And that concludes the business portion of our evening. Your accountant will be able to take care of this from now on. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - If there are any further legal matters for me, I prefer to deal with them by telephone or by post. I'm sure you will never come here again. - As you wish. Your grandmother had the same preferences. But don't you think our relationship has gone way beyond that of just lawyer-client, don't you, Elizabeth? Oh, this is gonna be fun. You wanna play, huh? Do you want to play hide and seek, Elizabeth? Oh, I like that. Come out, come out, wherever you are, Elizabeth! Oh. There you are. Come closer, Mr. McClain. Is everything all right? - Everything is fine now. Good night, Ms. Naibert. - Good night, Charles. Ms. Naibert. Ms. Naibert! - Yes, Charles. - It's time to go back to your room. We have a new medication for you. It's going to be much more effective. Yes, Rebecca, you don't have to worry about the ghost in the mirrors, anymore. * Vital signs are slow and steady * * So attentive still not ready * As I was just about to say * You are the one that's over * I am sporadic movement * You are sporadic movement * Hate is turning into hunger * Just the guy to pull me under * * I am sporadic movement * You are sporadic * I involve you * The energy dissolves you * In transformation * A chemical in the brain is so loud * * Decision making, turning inside out * * And what you want, yet nobody else has * * A swift injection to contain this spaz * * Snakes will burrow through my psyche * * What it takes to lash a strike and * * As I was just about to say * You are the one that's over * I am sporadic movement * You are sporadic movement * Hate is turning into hunger * Just the guy to pull me under * * I am sporadic movement * You are sporadic * I involve you * The energy dissolves you * In transformation * A chemical in the brain is so loud * * Decision making, turning inside out * * What you want, yet nobody else has * * A swift injection to contain this spaz * * The fire dies on it's own * Leaving us to ourselves but not exactly alone * * I think that somethin' is out there waiting * * Anticipation has grown * The air is black as can be, oh yeah * * Can't even see that my hand is in front of me * * I'm overhearing a whisper that won't escape * * Until the blood is set free * So turn back the
