Hip-hop had a start in gospel; it had a start in jazz; it had a start in blues, rock and roll, disco. Hip-hop. Hip-hop is a culture, the mother of four or five different elements, like rap, scratching, break dancing and graffiti. ♪♪ Rap is something that's being done. Hip-hop is something that is being lived. A rap artist can be anybody from anywhere, but you've got to visit the Bronx. Period. Wherever you are in life, wherever you wanna be, you will always be a rap artist, until you visit the South Bronx. Look at the projects. Look at the people. See the environment that hip-hop started in. Go to 123 Park... and just stand there... and imagine the birth of a culture... happening in this very spot. Hey ! Hey ![ Chattering ] The Bronxis hip-hop. Graffiti, break dancing, MCing and DJing all came from the Bronx. Yo, where we're standing right here, this is a historical place in hip-hop. This is like where it all began pretty much. The godfather of hip-hop, Kool Herc, used to live right here in this building, 1600. And he used to give jams right here in this little park. You know what I'm sayin' ? Plug up to a light pole, or get, like, electricity from one of the windows... and just play right out here. This was back in 1974. Yeah, I was hip to New York hip-hop. You gotta give props where props is due. They originated it. Anybody that doesn't believe that is trippin'. You know, see, I know niggas in the Bronx, they sparked it up. But, you know, it traveled from project to project. And they just spread it, and now it's bigger than ever, and it's gonna get bigger. Ghetto kids didn't really have the money... to learn how to play instruments or take singing lessons, but they found a way, regardless, you know. Because the spirit was still telling them to make some things. So it's like they just used whatever was around, whether it be a turntable or a little nasty mike and some old, dirty records. ♪♪ That's how the whole thing starts. DJs are the ones who started this hip-hop thing. Back when my man Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, all them in the Bronx, you know. It was like radio shock waves with new styles of scratching and stuff... This is one of the original instruments of hip-hop. Us DJs would, like, go nuts and try to learn how to do those cuts. Howie T might do a new scratch on this record. He did this one scratch. He went like...♪♪ He did that. When he first did that, everybody was buggin' out. And then, like, Mixmaster Ice did this scratch. He did that. And then, obviously, DST freaked everybody out on Herbie Hancock stuff when he was like... ♪ F-F-Fresh Fresh ♪ ♪ F-F-F-F-Fresh ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ And early, the first DJs in the Bronx would spin the records, and they would only play the breakdown of the record. They would play... Every record breaks down. ♪ Get down And it breaks into just the beat and the drums. ♪♪ [ Interrupted Vocals ] ♪♪ These are break beats. You know what I'm sayin' ? And a break beat can be anything from any kind of record, any kind of music, be it classical, be it soul, jazz, pop, rock, anything. It's any record that has a breakdown beat in it. So, Flash and people like that... Grand Wizard Theodore... would spin these records, but they would only play the breaks, and people would dance over the breaks in the record, and these were called "break dancers." [ Man ] Back then, everybody that I knew that really had mad flavor... in b-boying or poppin' used to be a hard-core criminal. Popping came along, and it made a difference in my life. You're too busy learning how to windmill than to rob and steal, and, you know, you're too tired to fight after you done battled somebody... and took all your aggression out on some dancin', you know. [ Mr. Animation ] Hip-hop ain't no easy game to play. If you ain't got no style, hang it up, sit down. My characters make people enjoy themselves... with how I move my body and everything like that. So I feel it's a part of fun, poppin' and breakin' and makin' people laugh. [ Chico ] It's not just a hype thing, something that we're just into just to make money. It goes way deeper, deeper than that. [ Lil' Caesar ] You know, they say, well, breakin' is not hip-hop, you know ? [ Chuckles ] Come on. If breakin' wasn't hip-hop, you know, they don't know the history. Breaking means to me that it's a way of expressing myself, getting my anger out there, you know, instead of going out there... and smoking or fighting, you know. I go to my own little world, and I just express myself through breaking. I dance, you know, and get creative. I'm just spinning, and I feel like I'm flying. I'm flying in the air, man, you know, and just... I'm free. - ♪ Yeah The only reality is now ♪ - ♪ Come on ♪ But when I say free back... ♪♪ The origins of graffiti go way past hip-hop. That goes back to World War II when, I mean, soldiers was writin' "Kilroy was here" and stuff on the walls, and, you know, people were just making statements. Here, it was just about gettin' up. You wanted to write your name in as many places... for as many people to see it so you'd be known. Graffiti is one of the most beautiful art forms in the world. You know, I'll be lookin' at some of the stuff Picasso be doin', and I'm like, well, Picasso ought to had to be there... to understand what you doin', you know. But then brothers' graffiti-ing they're givin' you firsthand... what they're seein' every day in the hood, you know. They're bringin' the news to you. Brothers shooting dice. They have dice there. They have the trains comin' by. All in one tag. Graffiti art means getting out... what a lot of people can't get out, you know. It's like expressing beauty, color, excitement, drama. It's everything like music. I just love the blend of the music. I remember I was groovin' to this sound, and it was Jackson Five. And this DJ was actually keeping this one part in the record... on and on and on, and then the guy was on the microphone just doin' that same stuff Muhammad Ali did. ♪ Let me see your hands flow like this ♪ ♪ Let me see your hands flow like this ♪♪ [ Ice-T ] The rapper would say, "You know what ?

Schooly-D had the recordPSK out at the time, and Ice-T hadSix In The Morning. And these were the only records we were playin'... because, you know, they were sayin' things that we could relate to, you know. Early West Coast rap. I would rap about tryin' to party. I did records like "Doggin' the Wax," "You Don't Quit." My boys were sayin', like, "Ice, man, why're you rappin' about parties, man ? We don't go to parties. We robparties." You know what I'm sayin' ? So I'm like, "Yeah, that is true." 'Cause while they were havin' a hip-hop scene in New York, we were havin' a gang scene. Due to the fact they called themselves a gang, people called this gangsta rap. Violence is part of that lifestyle, so you have to rap about it. Yo, this is where I got stuck. [ Man ] No shit ?Yeah, and I got stuck way up here. If a kid is in a gang, then he raps from the perspective of a gangbanger. But what if the kid sells drugs ? He's rapping from the perspective of a drug dealer. What if the guy's a pimp ? He'll rap from the perspective of a pimp. When you rap, basically you rap to another rapper. What a Gangsta Rapper says is: "You, listener, I will shoot you in your motherfuckin' face." He forgets about the rules. He forgets about the theory; what's right and wrong; message versus non-message. It is reality rap in its truest form, because you take out all the barricades.

As far as the music, all it was... was guys from the West Coast using different elements of music... that guys from the Northeast wouldn't touch, like funk. The West Coast sound, to me, was like a Moog keyboard, a lot more funk-type stuff with a lot of hand claps for snares, you know, a lot of whiny, high synthesizer-type things.

It was great. It was like God came and said, "Here's something that you can do." Now, when we started, and when we signed our first contract in 1982, you could count how many rap groups had... contracts, signed contracts, with companies. And major record companies was not taking chances with rap music. It was the small independent companies that would give rappers a chance. After 1985, hip-hop and rap made a split. Graffiti art and break dancin' no longer became... viable means of expressing this piece of the culture. Rap became the viable means of expressing this piece of the culture, and it was only because... corporate America... "Massa"... deemed it important. "Oh, we could make some money pressin' up these records. So, let's go." Rap is big business now. Now record companies aren't even concerned about the vinyl and stuff like that. They talkin' about CD sales and everything, but if it wasn't for vinyl, there wouldn't be any hip-hop music. These record labels, man, is just "shysty." They don't care about the artist. You know what I'm sayin' ? They let the artist do what he wanna do, they want... "Yeah, act silly." And, you know, "Yeah, do it for me." You know, they get a certain percentage. Man, we get kibbles.

I'm comin' from $20 a week allowance, till all of a sudden somebody gives me $1,000. And I'm like, you know, saying, "This is crazy." But that's all I got. The record companies are basically like a merchant bank. You know, they loan you money, and they want their money back with fat interest.

And you have to take care of both. I got into it just wantin' to make music. You know what I'm sayin' ? I didn't really give a damn about the business part of it. I was trustin' people, trustin' that they would handle my business the way it was supposed to be handled. And you get fucked like that. So you gotta be on top of your own business. Don't trust no managers, no record company execs, nothin' like that. Know it. Basically, every young, little motherfucker can rap, so we... All they wanna see is, "Well, where's your two hit singles ?" They gon' put that out, you might go double-platinum, and then next time... They gon' make four million off of you, you're gon' be broke. You come out with your next album. If it flops, they gon' get rid of you and find the next motherfucker. "Where'syour two hit singles ?" It's music and it's business... and, you know what I'm sayin', I have to find a fine line in between all of it. It's cool; I just make sure I take care of my business. I accept all the pros and cons of my record label, but I try to enjoy my art and do the best I can. In this business, 90% of artists... don't know when they're supposed to get paid, how they're supposed to get paid... or how much they're supposed to get paid. You can ask a new artist, "How much is a point worth ?" or what a pointis, and they can't answer the question; they don't know. But they can tell you how much a Mercedes costs. And, you know, the business wanna roll with it, so they fork money into it or simply be out of the game. So it's a give-and-take and you just gotta know what's actually goin' on... and the sacrifices you actually makin' spiritually, mentally and emotionally... when you're messin' with the music.

It's how I initially got in the business. It's how I met a lot of people. The parties are kind of an intricate part of the business.

First there was a group called The Funky Four Plus One More, and that one more was a female by the name of Sharock. Sharock. I was in love with this girl. I thought she was the best. She had a real good, clean voice. Powerful, strong, but still sexy and ladylike. She had good rhythm. And then there was The Sequence Girls, who came along with Sugar Hill Gang Records. They were actually the first female group on wax. And of course you had Salt-N-Pepa, who came along and came out with the first platinum hit for a female group. We've been able to endure a lot of hard times... because we do care... care about each other, but, um, she makes it fun. [ Giggles ] This girl is crazy. Um, we've always found it, um, our duty as, as female artists... We're about tellin' the ladies... I think, just to tell the females not to give them so much to talk about. Some of the young ladies have to become themselves, have to learn how to stop being what a man wants them to be... and start realizing who they are and what they are. If they wanna wear the short skirt, the baggy jeans, do whatever it is they wanna do. When guys say, like, "bitch" or "ho," it don't bother me... because for the simple fact... one, they not talkin' about me. Where I'm from... the west side of Chicago... we could see our homegirls and be, like, "What's up, bitch ? Shut the fuck up. You stupid." It's all in fun. It really depends on how you say the shit. You know when somebody's sayin' it wrong or when they're tryin' to be derogatory. And some autographed pictures... for all you bitches. And if you a bitch... It's just like "nigga." The same thing. People just take it differently. That shit turns me off. If you a lady, you need to act like a lady. You can act like a lady and still have skills rappin'. You know what I'm sayin' ? But when you start that old wanna be like a nigga... and hats and baggy jeans and boots... It's just a turnoff to me. [ Da Brat ] Why ? That's they life. This is mine. They don't like me to say "bitch," "fuck," "nigga" and "ho." That's me ! This is how I kick it. This is how I live. I'm just tryin' to be straight real. I ain't tryin' to come sugarcoated. I'm just tryin' to put it down the best way I know how. I'm not really big on that, 'cause I happen to think... that if we hold the women in higher respect, then the women who have the children of these men who call women "bitches" and "ho's"... will treat their children with more love and will raise up stronger individuals. My experience is, it has been hard to find... a female to work with... that I'm really diggin', you know. Out here on the West Coast there's not that many females that get into rap. They're all nine-to-fives, you know. Rome wasn't built in a day. The world's not gonna change overnight. Come here, Santi. Come here. Look in that camera, smile and say "hi." My name is Santineesh. Who am I ?Uncle Heavy. Gimme a kiss. Bye. [ Chuckling ] [ Santineesh ] Hug me again, Daddy ! [ Man Laughing ] Daddy ! I got you ! I got you ! [ Interviewer ] What kind of vibe do you like to create in the studio ? [ Santineesh Screaming, Laughing ]When I'm in the studio... Yo, D.O. Yo ! Gag her. [ Laughing ] At its best, hip-hop music can grab the nation by the neck... and make people realize what's goin' on. It's a voice for the oppressed people that, in many other ways, just don't have a voice. We didn't know nothin' about no West Coast, Philly, Jersey until rap came. Then we started communicatin' and just bein' one. It's the nigga news. We speak... I could tell people in New York what I'm goin' through... from my experiences as a Los Angeles young black man, and they can speak from a New York young black man, what they goin' through. You have guys who are rappers who are from the ghetto... and the stuff that they say is stuff that they live every day. These are their lyrics. After growin' up here... and seein' my man that lived upstairs gettin' killed, and then my brother shot... That showed me what type of world this shit is. You know what I'm sayin' ? [ Nas ] The most time I feared about livin' here... was when I was young, when I couldn't defend myself from shit was goin' on, 'cause it was older niggas doin' shit. It was a big world, I was young... and all I had was my moms and my brother, you know, my younger brother. So all I did was just handle myself to get to a position where I could say, "I'm gon' hold my ground. "I'm old enough to control my destiny... and not to be bullshitted by no bullshit niggas no more or nothin'." I been thinkin' about goin' back to school... because, I mean, my knowledge is limited right now. There's a lot of things that I don't know about that I could take advantage of... as soon as I learn about it. I'm not a big drug dealer... with 25 years on my head. I sing rap records... and I can make my bread. I'm not a doctor or lawyer, but I'm 21 with a start. You know, as far as messages go, what I'm tryin' to get across... I'm tryin' to get across, like, several different things. You know what I'm sayin' ? Like, for instance, there's one side of me... that's totally for the preservation of black youth, because we're dyin' at a rapid rate. The numbers of dyin' youth is increasing, like, daily in our neighborhood. Look, I can't stand the ghetto. A lot of rappers, you know, they run around... "Yeah, I'm from the ghetto !" I live in the ghetto. The ghetto don't live in me. This is an ill situation. We have been put here for a cause. We have been put here to die. That's genocide, man, and that's the bottom line. If I had the chance to live with a stream flowin' through my backyard, you think I wouldn't ? We're not here just because we wanna be hip and fly. It wasn't our choice to come to the ghetto, so I'm not stayin' true to the hood. I'm stayin' true to the people inthe hood. I don't want my kids to grow up in the environment I grew up in, so I moved out. I send my kids to the good schools, away from the fucked-up shit, because I didn't have that opportunity when I was a youth. I didn't have no choice. I had nowhere else to go. I had to stay there. But I know what I did to get here, and all them nights I spent in the studio, rappin' and writin', it was all me. You try to help your homies out. I hook niggas up. If you know how to rap, I'll try to get you a deal. I'll work with you in the studio. But it's not a form of going, "I got paper. Here you go... 1,000, 2,000, 5,000." That's what brothers expected. You have to learn who your true homies are and shit. You got the jealous homies that don't wanna see you come up; you got the player haters; you got the crooked females who wanna set you up. Then you got the niggas in general who just roll around... looking for niggas, period, to jack. I don't put my city down. I love Compton to the fullest. But with me bein' a father, a businessman, me stayin' in Compton would mean me havin' to deal with the same situations... as I dealt with as a teenager. I moved out to the community where I could walk out my front door... and wouldn't have to see gang-writin' and shit like that, because I lived in that shit all my life, and I figure, if you can you might as well, to better yourself and your future family. [ Barking, Snarling ] You can't have this out-of-control dough... and stay in the same house you grew up in. It's impossible; you gonna get licked sooner or later. You ain't gotta, you know, move from California, but you get a million dollars and your mama been on Section Eight all your life... and she been livin' in apartments all her life, you ain't gonna stay there. [ C-Style ] There's always gon' be people that don't like me... because they think I'm doin' too much or showin' off, but still, even the ones who do be players, them be ones who was friends from a long time ago. So really, when they do talk that kind of stuff and all that... I shine it on, but I still talk to 'em... and let 'em know I still got a lot of love for 'em, regardless of how they playin'. I still live in my same neighborhood. Still do the same thing, still wear the same clothes. I don't wear no costume. What I come to a concert with, that's what I wear on stage. We're just fortunate that a lot of people bought the records. It's great, but we still the same people. We make our music for the kids around the block. We still live in the projects; we still keepin' it real. As you see, it's mad peoples right here, right now... that's just wit' us, 'cause this is how I been before this rap shit came off. You know what I'm sayin' ?Word up. So therefore, you see our chamber. We're gettin' high; niggas got beer.[ Laughing ] Know what I'm sayin' ? Niggas is still watchin' they back from the cops. But it's all real ! Nobody fuckin' wants to live in the ghetto. The best thing you can do is get out and get your family up outta there. Interviewers'll come over and say, "You don't live in a black community." Well, where is "the black community" ? Where do white people live ? White people live wherever the fuck they want to live. There is no "black community," there's a poor community, and I'm not tryin' to live in no fuckin' poor community. I been makin' records 14 years, and movies. I should not have shit ? Would that make you happier ? What in the fuck did they think we was stealin' for in the hood ? When I was in South Central, we used to look up at these hills. This was my goal, to one day get out of the ghetto. The best thing I'm doin' for my community is showing them... that a brother like myself, without givin' in to the Man, can make it, and that means theycan make it. When my friends come up here they say, "This is inspiring, Ice, 'cause you did it with your hat turned back, tellin' America to kiss your fuckin' ass." Interviewers'll come over and say, "Well, you got a big house," and I'm like, "Just say I got a big housefor somebody black, you racist motherfucker." I look at it like this: When I was in the hood we were sellin' drugs; we was robbin' and shit. The community wasn't really by our side. There wasn't no shit where they was likin' us. Nobody liked us in the area. We had to eat; my daughter had to eat; so we was doin' what we had to do, no matter what "the community" felt about it. After I left the drugs alone and started doin' the music shit, then all of a sudden the community's, like, "Yeah, he's doin' good now." It seemed like fake love to me. You ain't had no love for me when I was fucked up and I had to sell drugs to live, so why have more fuckin' love for me now 'cause a nigga's doin' good ? My real niggas is by my side; that's all I need. I think me hustlin', sellin' drugs, it schooled me to the streets a lot. I learned a lot. I learned there's some things you can do and some things you can't do. Sellin' drugs forever is something you can't do. You cannot do that. You will eventually die or go to jail. That's a fact. I was up in Harlem World, Union Square, Latin Quarters. I was up in there like this... sneaky, razor blade in my mouth and shit, you know. When you young, you'll do anything. Mesc tabs up in my system, cocktail cigarettes, dust, blunts and shit. I went through that whole phase. Lived life fast and lived it quick. But, you know, there ain't no... When I got the knowledge of myself and shit, I was able to adapt... and calm things down. Then when I had my first seed the nigga woke up. Life is more than just about me. I got generations to bring forth. Basically, Cypress Hill used to hang out in front of right here. You know, getting fucked up. You know, drinking beers and shit, talking shit. Then, you know, we get to rhyming and shit. I smoked B-Real his first joint right down there on that tree right there. So we used to come chill right here 'cause we used to could, like... you could hide from the cops right here and get high. [ Sen Dog ] But in '85, there was a big weed drought. And '86 was the year that crack came in, and everything changed. Crack really just ripped an asshole out of the neighborhood. I mean, all the... even the drug dealers... that had all the cars, you seen them get smoked. And it was like a siphon. Like, anybody who fucked with it just got sucked in. [ Man #1 ] No, that's incriminating ! Don't do that ! [ Man #2 ] That on TV... You know what ? You're gonna have to change your style. This ain't it. You're fallin' outta control. My brother is putting me out. [ Chuck D ] The crack movement came out... and a lot of people that even vibed on crack, the music was faster. You know, the environment, much quicker. And the commentary kind of went to the tempo of the effects of the drugs, and political rap and conscious rap... tried to make people look at what they was doin'. And if they was doin' things in a negative way, try to look at it in an unhip way. Try to make it unhip or unfashionable. All of a sudden, all these anti-drug records... started comin' out of the... out of the hip-hop scene, where it's, like, if you're on crack, you know, like, um, Brand Nubians, um... Grand Puba was talkin' about it, you know. ♪ Slow down So, now, if somebody tell you, "Yo, man, we getting ready to smoke crack," you look at 'em crazy, like, "Nigga, you're gonna smoke crack ? That shit is wack." [ DJ Muggs ] Shit ain't changin', man. It's just gettin' worse out here, if anything. That's just the part of everyday life, man. It ain't... It ain't nothing shocking us, surprising us. It's just like... a lot of motherfuckers will stop and look at it and be like, "Whoa." Walk by it. Well, that's, you know, same old thing. See it every day. [ B-Real ] I sold it, and I've seen what it does to people, and I kind of got a bad conscience about that. ♪♪ ♪ The world is full of thugs, hustlers Big Willie mobsters ♪ ♪ I kill rappers on the records It's my job to separate the real from the fake ♪ ♪ So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate ♪ The Lords of the Underground try to, you know, express, like, the funny side, the good side, or, you know, out of the normal of the hood... that people don't really talk about, because we always hearing about the negative.

But now that I look back and see how they raised me, I saw that they was right. Y'all may not understand it right now, but when y'all get older, y'all gonna see what I mean. Your mom and dad, man, those are definite role models, I think. She was just a single black mother, and she gave me... You know, she didn't let nothing, no obstacles stand in her way. She overcame every obstacle. You know what I'm sayin' ? My mother owns my company. She owns Bad Boy. You know, that was my gift to her. She was the only one that was always there for me, no matter what. Yeah, my mother is the closest one to me, you know? She gave me everything I always wanted. You know what I'm sayin' ? Christmastime, I had it all, and my friends didn't. She just gave you everything that was in style. She made sure I had it. Some things I couldn't get, but the things I did got, I was real happy for. When the rest of the world is crazy, I know that I can come home and everything is cool. And that's what makes you want to take a chance. But a lot of people who don't have that, that type of support... And I feel sorry, you know what I'm sayin' ? That's one part of my strength. It's the fact that no matter what happens... if this industry falls in love with me... or decides that they no longer love me, and they want to get rid of me, you know... those people will always be in my corner. When you talk about my mom, it's beyond words. [ Spice 1 ] She just did everything, you know. I love her for that, man. [ Spice 1's Mom ] He was on the Saint B's basketball team. And this is, uh, break dancing. This is how he started. I think that was just before rapping. He was actually in high school on this one. He's about 17 years old. I go on some video shoots with him. I was very proud of this one, because his sister was in it also. That's his sister, and that's Spice 1. [ Spice 1 ] Every time we go somewhere, if we got a concert, and she wanna come, I have, like, 12 or 13 of my homeboys surrounding her with straps. Nigga, don't let nobody touch my mama. [ Spice 1's Mom ] Oh, I worry about his safety a lot. A lot of things has happened to him. He's been shot at, harassed. When he was little, we thought he was gonna be a preacher, because he carried a Bible around all the time, had his name on it. Well, he is a preacher, only he does it through his rap. He's been promising me a house since he was a little boy, and I had no idea how he was going to buy it, but now I know. All of our heroes were killed off: Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, uh, uh, JFK. So I grew up having heroes that were the local drug dealer, pimps, the pushers, the... the... the guys with the dough, the guys who were riding around in the Sevilles and Cadillacs, you know. Guys who were flashing the hundred-dollar bills, the number runners. The whole thing about hip-hop was to wear the... the gold chain... and, you know, to dress like the street hustler. [ Nas ] The nigga'd tell about... he got on a Rolex watch and all this shit. Now, without finishing school, going to college... or just starting a business or something, you want to wonder how you get that Rolex watch. And that's the part of it. That's the mystique... that leads you to want to be where he's at. I rap. I try to get money here. You know what I'm sayin' ? But as far as everybody else in the community my age, they probably gotta get a job at McDonald's. And then they mind is just like mine, where they really working at McDonald's, saying, "Damn, I want better than this." But you can ask 90% of the people that's involved in hip-hop music... what they would be doin' if hip-hop didn't exist, and I can guarantee you it won't be positive. [ Chuck D ] Sometimes the reachin' and the showin' off... with the Lexuses and the Big Willie-ism... That's cool for some, but, you know, it's a nightmare to most because 99 out of 100... don't achieve that particular dream. So our particular dreams have to be rooted more to reality. And people talk about keeping it real, but you gotta make it real first. [ Ice-T ] I mean, I'm an ill individual. I mean, if you really get off into me, man, I'm like... I'm ill. I'm, like... All I watch is horror movies and shit. But I've kind of, like, learned to control my negative side and turn... I've turned it a very... I'm a very peaceful, calm individual. I don't wanna hurt nobody, so I kinda, like, send that energy I used to have that was static, that I used to act out... I put that in my music. It's like, once you've been a criminal, and you've been out there, and you've felt the... the excitement... and the adrenaline rush of that life, you're intoxicated forever. But I know the way I'm living now. I... I respect this life too much. I would never take a risk like that, because anything I went after now, it would have to be like a million and up. If I put a score down like that, somebody's probably gonna end up dead. And I'll probably be on the run for the rest of my life. But I still got the skills, and I know I can... I'm more of a... I'm more of a crook than I am a rapper. I know that. [ Chattering ] [ Woman ] Here you go. That's the way you like it. That's right. They're golden brown.I really did yours the same way, dear.

I'm not gonna let you know what kind of game I would be in. That's for me to know and for you to find out. Yeah, I was into other stuff, you know, but... there came a time when I got a reality check, you know, when something happened to me, so... After that, when it happened, you know, I decided that I knew I better do this, or, you know, I might not be able to do nothin' no more, period. - [ Gunshot Fired ] - I got shot. - [ Gunshot Fired ] - I was confined to a wheelchair for, like, a year-and-a-half. - [ Gunshot Fired ] Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I talk about it.

[ Newscaster ] Charlton Heston spoke out today against gangsta rap music... that is aimed at the police. Heston claimed that the violent content of the lyrics... has a negative influence on American values. [ Mack 10 ] That's where white America pisses me off at. See, Arnold Schwarzenegger can kill a whole fuckin' police force in his movie, but the minute Mack 10 talkin' about shootin' one police or something, they wanna take my record off the shelves. Some of us didn't even graduate from high school, and we makin' seven figures, you know what I'm sayin' ? It's hard for you to swallow, if you went to Harvard or Yale... all your motherfuckin' life, and you ain't makin' but $50,000 a year. And a motherfucker like us can make a million a year. You know what I'm sayin' ? That's hard for you to swallow. Put it like this. NWA was not a prophet. You know what I'm sayin' ? When they was talking about "Fuck the Police," and one time, was doing this and that... I mean, I sat there, and I said, "Hell, yeah." But the average white American, if we... if we gonna have to generalize, they say, "Why... Why would they think such a thing ?" You don't really have any love for 'em, you know ? I ain't never seen no cop gettin' no cat out of a tree. Now I live in a nice neighborhood, the cops are different over here. They're like, "Hey, how're you doin' ?" Sendin' me Christmas cards and shit. It's just a little different, but average kid in the streets, he's never had a cop help him. So the attitude is: Fuck the police. ♪♪ [ Scratching ] [ Police Siren Wails ] [ Man ] In the neighborhoods, most of the time, it's the same cops. And they know what's goin' on around there. And they see you, if you somebody that they been seein'. You know what you're doin'. They know what you're doin'. They see you, and you see them. You know, you know, it's on. [ MC Eiht ] When you live where I live, and if you just black, period. Like they say, it's a routine. A black man in a fancy car, you gonna get pulled over. You're gonna get asked to step out your car. You're gonna get your car searched. No probable cause, no reason, no whatever. It just happens. It's just routine. The same crime element that white people are scared of, black people are scared of. The same crime element that white people fear, we fear. So we defend ourselves from the same crime element... that they scared of, you know what I'm sayin' ? While they waitin' for legislation to pass, we next door to the killer. We next door to him, you know, 'cause we up in the projects, where there's 80 niggas in the building. All them killers that they're lettin' out, they're right there in that building. But it's better just 'cause we black, we get along with the killers or something ? We get along with the rapists 'cause we black and we from the same hood ? What is that ? We need protection too. This is why we rhyme, and this is our reason. You know what I'm sayin' ? We live this life. I got copper friends. But now I'm makin' proper ends. My illegal drug money. What's going on ? I don't hate all cops. I hate certain cops. You know what I mean ? [ Man ] I hate cops. They hate us. We got beef in the West Coast. We got beef in the East Coast. We're police. Hey, the big police, the biggest motherfucking gang out this motherfucker with guns. The other day, you know what I'm sayin, I wear my one pants leg down, one pants leg up. We were in Chicago, and one of the security guys, you know, he came at me, all sayin': "Either you roll your pants leg down, or you keep both of them up." I thought he was playin', but he got all... all up in my face. We just performed. Why you even sweatin' me like that ? "Well, it's a gang thing." All up in my face, though. You know what I'm sayin' ? That's not even necessary. Now, if I was to punch him in the shit, I'd have been wrong. You know what I'm sayin' ? But I kept it cool, you know what I'm sayin' ? Not tryin' to be rude and all that, I said, "Money, could you please just get out of my face, 'cause I'm not rollin' my pants leg down." Respect is a really high thing in the black community. And once somebody feels disrespected, that's when the issue arises. Cops need to learn how to talk to people. [ Police Siren Wailing ] [ Mack 10 ] Wasn't botherin' nobody. Wasn't no other cars around. The cop that pulled me over just wants me to keep my wheels on the ground. And he said, "I could impound your car now, but I ain't gonna trip right now." So I said, "All right, then don't trip right now. Give me my break then." It ain't nothin' but a hydraulic ticket. I don't worry about it. He just wanted to pull me over 'cause he was a asshole.

Rap now is a $3-billion-a-year industry. Black-owned labels aren't being intimidated anymore, you know. There's, uh... Russell Simmons has always been out there with Def Jam, and Sean "Puffy" Combs, uh, you know, with Bad Boy Entertainment, you know... they're all doin' their thing.

Police are looking for a late-model white Cadillac, last seen speeding southbound on Colbalt Lane. Meanwhile, family, friends and fans of the rap singer... surround U.M.C., wishing they could share... their messages with Shakur. I'm one of his biggest fans, and I love him so very much. And I don't want Tupac to get shot. I don't... I don't want Tupac to get shot no more. [ Male Reporter ] Breaking news to tell you about. The rapper Tupac Shakur died in Las Vegas. He died, apparently, this afternoon in a Las Vegas hospital. You might remember he was shot... [ Fades Out ] Pac was a prophet. He knew things... that none of us see yet. And he put it in his music. His only release was his music. I rolled with Pac. We came up together. And Pac ain't never let me roll with him, to pull no gun on no black man. Pac wasn't no gangster. Pac was a soldier. [ Applause ] We all should work together to try to get more unity within rap. And... And... And I see that happening, for the most part. I see a lot of rappers doin' duets with each other from the different coasts. East Coast, West Coast together, like that. East Coast and West Coast get down together... and make it happen, you know what I'm sayin' ? In Queens, New York, they speak nice. These are all-town gangsters.Right, right. I'm gettin' sassed. Ow ! I can't dis the whole East Coast. I got homeboys, you know, from the East Coast. I... I... I can't... I mean, everybody in the East Coast don't hate Mack 10. I don't give a fuck. I got down with MC Eiht. That's my nigga. That's West Coast, you know what I'm sayin' ? And it's blowin' up over there, you know what I'm sayin' ? The East Coast, West Coast shit is stupid, 'cause how am I gonna beef with a nigga who ain't got nothin' and I ain't got nothin' ? When these... When these other motherfuckers got everything, and nobody's beefin' with them. And nigga's quick to pull out a gun on you, wants me, I'm a shoot that nigga. I'm gonna kill him. And when the cops come, he gets scared. How the fuck are you scared of him, when you ain't scared of him ? So that shit don't really add up to me and shit. I deal with mathematics. If you got a problem with somebody, you got a problem with that individual, you know ? Square off with him. Don't go dissin' a whole fucking coast. Go and spread the love. East Coast and West Coast. That right there settles everything. There's no need gettin' us involved. You know, you don't see niggas fightin' and robbin'... and killin' and shootin' over this here, you know what I'm sayin' ? When niggas get together with this here, it's all about peace. And that's what we're tryin'...Ain't nothin' wrong. East Coast, West Coast.We get into our vibe that we... This ain't crack. This is weed. We smoke weed, 'cause when we smoke weed, we breed. All right ? Yo. So, it's more than just knowin' your block. Know your state, East Coast, West Coast. There's seven continents out there. And there's, you know, hundreds of countries. Education is key, because it tells people... what to look out for and how to prepare themselves. Economically, you know, we can't talk about more black jobs... without black businesses. Everybody's not fortunate enough to be a doctor or lawyer, you know ? Everybody doesn't complete four years of college, you know ? It gives you something else to do, and it is a job, straight up. [ Man ] It's bringing in a lot of niggas out of the ghettos.

Not being scared of who you are. And step out and express. Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow and them passed the torch to us. Also, Run DMC, LL Cool J had it. Passed it on with Rakim. Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions. They took it on, pass it on. You got E.P.M.D. comin' out. Then you got your Tribe Called Quest comin' out. And then the West Coast caught some at the same time. They catchin' it with Ice-T. He grew a part of it. He's runnin' it now. The torch is goin' on to the next one that goin' on.
