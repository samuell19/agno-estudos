I shot him three years ago. A real man killer. It was in Bengal. I got this one in Bavaria. A Giant of an animal. There is something almost human about him. You could almost say he was laughing at us. I wouldn't exactly say that. Just observe the look in his eyes. He looks as if he... ...he hates us. Perhaps when he was alive he was something more than a wolf. Something more? How so? Perhaps he could have been a man. A werewolf. Of course. A werewolf A Lycanthrop. Legend has it that a man is turned into a wolf during a full moon. The only way he can be killed and put out of his misery, is by a woman who loves him enough to pierce his heart with a silver weapon... like a silver bullet for instance. Ah, now I understand why you have not joined us. Interesting topic. You were saying it could have been a man? A werewolf? No. I've killed him myself but I can assure you it was with an ordinary bullet! Henry, your an expert on the human brain, are you not? I heard that your grandfather went even further... in his studies of split personalities. Now tell us. Do you think that there is any valid argument in this nonsense? I think that currently is not the right time to talk about it. Have you ever read A Midsummer Night's Dream? Sure. Why? For me, one of the passages reminds me of you. A man is turned into an ass. Be careful it doesn't happen to you! Ladies and gentlemen - I wish you a pleasant evening. Imre, Justine, I wish you a pleasant honeymoon. - Henry! - Sorry, Justine - I'm sure he didn't mean to offend you. - I know what he was getting at. It is best to leave. Goodbye. I wish you all the luck. We will see you when we get back. I just don't understand. There wasn't a hidden crack in what I said! I can't imagine what happened to him. Now Henry's like this at times. I wouldn't worry about it. It's just better to leave him alone. Now please, let's enjoy ourselves! Doctor Jekyll and The Werewolf Believe me ... In all my life I have never looked forward to anything with such great pleasure as I have with this trip. I'll return to the place were I was born walking through the streets of my beloved village. Visiting my parents graves. Baliavasta, that is the name of the village. I left when I was a child. I have always kept.. a memory of it in my heart. Who would have thought it! Imre Kostaz, a cold mercyless businessman, is in the final analysis a romantic at heart! Filled with nostalgia . Never forget that I'm Hungarian, and no Hungarian forgets his homeland. A honeymoon in Transylvania? Right in the middle of the Carpathian mountains? Really, Imre! You might have waited a little longer to return to your village. Agatha, it was I who urged Imre to go to Transylvania. The Idea fascinates me. It must be gorgeous. I can't wait! You mustn't forget to pack a cross and a few heads of garlic in your luggage. I understand that there are thousands of vampires in that part of the world My word, it's late already! We really must go. Tomorrow you must get up early and you need to sleep. - Have a wonderful trip. - Thank you. Do not forget to write. We won't. When are we going to get to this village? It's almost night. We should be pretty near now. Now Justine please, don't worry. Don't start getting yourself nervous. In Bistritz-in we were told that it was only about 40 kilometers away. I'm sure we've traveled more than that. There aren't any signs and no one to ask. There isn't anything anywhere. Damn it! The car! That's all we needed! Get out of here! Easy, easy, don't worry Justine. It was nothing. It was Bela. He wanders around in that area. Everyone is afraid to get near him. The funny thing is ... that once he was a rich and respected man. Then he got sick. Someone burned his house. Destoryed his land. Set his dogs on him! He was slowly drivin to madness. And now, wandering around like a living dead man. Just rotting away. - A Leper. Well, he certainly scared the hell out of us! Especially my wife. The very best person you possibly could have met since you've arrived. This part of the country is filled with theives and worse things ... When the night time comes... the best thing to do is to shut yourself securely up in your house Making sure that the doors and windows are tightly bolted. I would like to go to the cemetery tmorrow. Which one? There two you know. The old one and the new one. People I'm looking for were buried in 1938. Then ... it is older. The newer one was built in 1945. Just after the war ended. - It is better not to go to the old cemetery. - Why? What is wrong? I'll tell you. At the cemetery ... Damned souls rise from the grave ... to attack humans. Terrible things have happened there. More afraid of living than the dead. Near the cemetery is the black castle. A man who lives there is a monster I beg you to not go there. Unbelievable. Like something out of the Middle Ages. I'm afraid that your warning hasn't convinced me. Tomorrow I will visit the old cemetery. I came all the way from England to do just that. Do not say I did not warn you. Did you take up the drink I asked for my wife? Of course. I made the drink myself before joining you. You really have a young and beautiful wife. It would be awful if something were to happen to her. Good night. Good night. Pleasant sleep. What gloomy place. He scares me. This way, Justine. They were killed. Someone had broken into the house, and hacked them to bits with an axe. I was in Bistritz, with family so I was safe. The murderers were never found. I was only seven years old. Afterwards, I went to England with the aunt and uncle. Imre ... check it out. It must be to the castle the innkeeper told us of. Their robbing the car! Imre! Don't! Dear God, Don't Go! What are you doing? He! He! I told you, Otvos. I have warned all of you. Don't go near the old graveyard and castle. They seemed to be very rich. Could be a good booty. Mostly ... I'm not stupid enough to believe in those old wives' tales. I'm not afraid of nothing, whatever was in the castle. You two are new. Well I'll tell you this. It's the Devil himself who walks through the old cemetary and castle. And there were a few horrible deaths. And now Ferenc Branco ... and my brothers ... also dead! The old woman who lives in that castle. I've seen in the village. That would be Uswika Bathory! People are afraid of her because it is a witch. If anyone angers her, you will get the evil eye. and will be forever cursed! Also they say she ... breast fed the monster, which is located in the castle. You old crazy idiot! You expect us to believe in that nonsense? I tell you ... with a precise gunshot ... I'd get rid of the old witch and her monster! Do not worry, Waldemar. She will get well. I will take care of her. What she has gone through, reduced her resistance. She might go mad. She could even die. Believe old Uswika. I will make her be better again. Have you found any entry to the castle? Yeah. It's near the old cemetery. I saw old Uswika go in. And her leper. It must lead to the castle cellar. It will be easy. We'll take them by surprise. Kill them then rob the castle. We'll be rich! And my brother will be avenged. I like it. When we start? Tonight. Why wait? But ... tonight ... - The full moon! - So what? Old old wives' tales. It is for other fools. You saw how they killed your brothers. You yourself have called him the devil. He's strong and fights well. But he's only human. You'll see when it is taken care of. He will die - as any man. All right. Where are we? At midnight. At the Hangman's Cross. Do you hear that? Don't be such a coward! It is a common wolf. Slowly, slowly, calm down. You do not have to fear us. You are among friends. This is Waldemar. He saved your life. Do you remember? Imre! Imre! Oh God. Imre! Now I know it exists! That damn monster ... I must destroy it! I must! Impossible! He is the devil incarnate. You'll just get yourself killed. I don't think anybody in Baliavasta will help you. Daninsky family were originally of Polish origin. Moved here a few centuries ago. Here I started as a servant when Waldemar was born. His mother died just after his birth. His father was killed in the war. I stayed here alone with the child. Why live here? Here is so lonely. Waldemar is ill. He is very ill. What is the matter with him? Justine ... Please, trust me. I want to help you. I will do everything I can. Then tell me - Who killed my husband? Who are they and why they do this? Why did they kill him? I do not know. This way there are many robbers. Take me to Bistritz. Maybe we can get help there. Justine, believe me. I know it's difficult. But there is no other way. Not now but in a few days we will go. Justine, do not worry. For in a few days you'll be away from here. And you? What will you do? I feel that you are in grave danger. You must immediately get out of here. It is my destiny, I can not escape. I know you're sick. Why can't you trust me? Justine, you can not tell you anything. You have to trust me. These are villagers who want to kill you. You and anyone who lives with you. Am I right? Listen, we have to get rid of him. Forever. Otherwise, women and children will never be safe here. We will bring the silver from the village to make bullets. Do it before the next full moon. They are demons. You can not do anything. Nothing. All right. I will prove you that are mistaken! You'll see! Stay in this room, Justine There will be a terrible night. Even you or I will not be able to help. I'll lock you in. Tomorrow we leave Baliavastu. Kill the monster! Kill him! Kill the monster! Listen, look what I brought. Look! Yes! This is the head of Uswika Bathory. She is the witch... you were so afraid of! Here's her head! Now you see she has no powerl! Let's go! Now it's time to kill a monster! Bring all of your silver to the blacksmith! Go! Just as I expected. I knew that you try to escape. I came to avenge my brothers. Damn demons! Believe me, Henry. All I said is true. Justine. I can not believe it. It is impossible. Do you remember that evening when we last saw each other? What did you say about wolves? There I was convinced of it. Now I realize that it was a premonition. I was only fooling. Such things do not exist. Henry, do you think I'm crazy? Absolutely not. You had a terrible shock. What is the impact on you at some point. So, you do not believe me? Werewolf! It sounds so fantastic .. But how can Henry Jekyll be so skeptical? You're the only one who could help Waldemar. Where else could I go? I'll try. To begin with, we need some tests. Of course. Whatever you want. For the next full moon, Waldemar must come to the clinic. We'll see what happens. Henry, he's not crazy ... not sick. Something worse. A lot worse. When he transforms, he becomes mad killer. A terrible monster. We will be ready for it. I can only help if you follow my orders. OK. I'll bring him to the clinic. Only him. You must stay away until I make a desision. - but, Henry! - These are my conditions. Trust me. All right. He'll come alone. He should come at mid afternoon. It will take me time to prepare. Perfect. Waldemar will be so happy. He'll have hope. She's very pretty. And very unhappy. Do you still love her? Yes. I always will. Now she needs you right? She had a horrible experience. But some of what I was told, it could be true. We'll soon find out. Sandra, you have to help me with the experiment. It may be dangerous. I will use a formula discovered by my grandfather that turned him into Mr. Hyde Good against evil! The eternal struggle. Today it can be controlled. Fascinating! Of course I will help you, Henry. As always. Here we will be safe. Over here no one comes. Justine it is my fault you have to hide. To not see your family. Being here ... It could ... Be dangerous ... Dear ... Henry will heal you. Do not worry. I love you, Waldemar. Looking for Dr. Jekyll's office... - Sixth Floor. - Thank you. They've been trapped in the elevator more than two hours now. It is a serious breakdown. I'll fix it soon. It's late now. Perhaps he'll never come. Maybe it existed only in your friends imagination. It's late ... ! Why? Why must this happen? It is impossible to continue working at the clinic after what happenend. What now? We will continue here. You said that there was a passage to the attic? Yes. - It was designed for farm harvest storage . - Perfect. There we will mount all the equipment. Can I be cured? I do not know, Waldemar. But we'll try. The formula of my grandfather knew how to change his identity. Hyde would have been pure evil. Pure and simple. In some ways, similar to werewolves. Now I have made an antidote serum for the one my grandfather used. Hyde made the Jekyll name an infamous one. But perhaps this will help to save you. Henry, how will you do it? On the night chosen right before the full moon rises. I will inject the serum that will turn Waldemar into a Mr. Hyde. That is the evil part of the persons character. During the full moon he'll fight against the mutation. The same mutation that turns him into a werewolf. Go on... It will be very dangerous. If Hyde wins, I will then inject the anti-Hyde antidote. Waldemar will be free of both demons. When do we start? If everything goes well ... during the next full moon. The newspaper wrote that some deranged killer's terrorizing London. A Sadist ''worse than Jack the Ripper'' Scotland Yard ''is working day and night'' ''Where's the killer?'' ''Will there be more murders?'' Newspapers are full of it. Did you get the supplies? Are there any problems? No. None. I used some of the people you know, that can be trusted to keep quiet. I almost forgot ... The Inspector ... He was again at the clinic. We must be careful. They must not know what we're doing. Cardio! Encefologram! Syringe! Just as I suspected. His blood has changed its features, to become that of a wolf. Also ... Changes in the central nervous system and the organic structure. And more importantly ... records show the changes in relation ... between brain cells ... and brain membrane. Now I have all the data we needed. Waldemar, I really think you can be saved. But you must leave us to our work. Do you think that you can really cure him? I think. We will find out during the next full moon. Are you crazy? Thank of what it could mean. If you cure him, evrything is done. We have a chance to get the power to govern. Control of the human brain. Even the soul! Eternal Soul! They trust me and I shall help them! Just think how much I have done for you. Your lover, friend. I've done everything for you. I Believed in you and your ambitions. I've even broke the law for you! Law? Yes, remember the clinic! Don't forget all those patients who died as hopeless guinea pigs. All those bodies ... We had no choice. You know that. And what about now? How is this different? "She" is perhaps the one in question ... First she refused you because of that fool Imre. And now it's because of this monster Waldemar. Remember Henry ... the deepest love can be transformed into the deepest hatred! Forgive me, Sandra. I'm sorry. Henry, will it be tonight? Yes, everything is ready. I'm afraid, Henry. What if we fail? It will be all right. Waldemar will be cured. - and how is Sandra? - She's getting supplies in London. She hates me. I believe her capable of doing anything. Like me she's a frustrated person. But her responsibility is not questionable. Don't it make your concern. We'll succeed. Thank you, Henry. Thank you. Please stay in your room tonight. It could be dangerous. - Are there any problems? - Actually no. Police weren't at the clinic. They think you're in America. Cut me loose! I must be free! My blood is boiling! Do you hear me? Boiling! Balance is again changed. Once again we have absolute evil, Sandra! It's Hyde. Waldemar became Hyde! When the moon appears, Hyde will destroy the werewolf. Then with the antidote Hyde will be destroyed. If it's all finished, we will save Waldemar! Liberate me! Vile pigs! Liberate me! Let me go! I want to live! No? No? Let me live! Everything is done, Waldemar. Now you're free. I warned you, Henry. That the deepest love can turn into the deepest hatred. Do you like to your new lover? Does he please you ... more than Waldemar? I'm sure he's more hot! Much more passionate. Am I right? Show her how much you want her ... you need her... She's yours! You took away my Henry! His death is your fault! Yes! SUFFER! SUFFER! You damn bitch! It was your fault. Be careful, I don't want her to die yet, I still have some plans. Tonight - and every night. I will go to London. You will work exactly as I say. No you've no power over me anymore. I need pleasure, Women! Yes! A lot of women! Bitch! Slut. From now on you will listen to me! Or I'll kill you. Do you hear me? I'll kill you. Hey, guys ... Got a light? Fire? Help! Help! Help! Help! Henry! What happened? Who did it? Sandra tried to kill me. Listen ... there is not much time. Henry, what do I do ...? What should I do to stop all this? There is hope ... ... the experiment is not finished ... Only the first phase. Three, maybe more, is necessary ... The serum will weaken. And if Hyde gets no more ... It will be weaker. And when that happens. For the next full moon, The werewolf will appear. Waldemar will ... Will he continue to suffer? No. To be free... his body must die. So that his soul can find ... ... Peace. You have to ... Say it. I will do everything. You have to destroy the serum. At all costs keep it away from Hyde. Then during the full moon ... When Waldemar ... will become a werewolf. Go back ... to the lab. On the right side ... under the flooring, is a box. In which there is a gun with silver bullets. And some papers. Destroy them for God's sake. Hold it still. Stay out of sight ... while the full moon appears Only your love ... will give you the strength to succeed Stupid bitch! Jekyll was not dead. Justine is now escaped. I was surprised. I could not do anything. Now they will try to destroy me. And it's your fault! Damn! He took the serum! It means life to me. I leave this place. I'll go into town. I'm strong! There would be no more need the serum. Never! Excuse me. I have to say hi to some friends. No! Damn! No. I'm soft! I'm weak! Hey! Who are you? Where is the guy that was here? Waldemar, - I am. I am ... Justine.
