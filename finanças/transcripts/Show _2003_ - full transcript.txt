What should I say? Just to be famous, somebody famous. Just that. My hobbies? Reading, my job... I work in advertising. Many things. Advertising's what I do. I like cinema, fashion, etc. I also sing. Personally, for myself, I haven't read anything lately. I have my studies. My favorite book is "Eight Parts of Desire". It's about the revolt, in the 80's, during the rule of ayatollah Ruhamini. Khomeini. Sure, I know some poets. But not personally. I think Czeslaw Milosz died 2 years ago, but I'm not quite sure. Oh, he got a Nobel prize, right? I guess he's dead by now. Nobody lives forever. To the theater? Yeah, recently, but where? But I usually go with my kid cousin, so it's plays for children. It's by David Lunch. He's a well-known director. A psychologist director, so to speak. A psychological film is... one with a surprising ending which we don't expect. That's why it's interesting. I like comedy. I also still remember certain scenes from "Psy". Krzysztof Zanussi was a director. Krzysztof Zanussi? I knew who he is... I can't remember any titles right now. But... "A contractible disease sexually transmitted". He's alive, Wajda. He's alive. Still alive. No, I don't know, I've never had such a disease. Well, about all these directors... Honestly, I don't pay attention to who is the director. According to me, my favorite movie of Wajda is "Psy". The battle of Grunwald took place in... the year one thousand... I really have no idea when it was. 1000 something? However, I suppose it was around... the year 1500... 23? Against the Turkish. Or the Tatars. 1023? We won in the first fight. They had no chance. I don't like history. I can learn some parts if necessary. I've no idea why I ended up studying humanities. I think Polish people are smart, because I'm Polish, so I will always claim, as a compatriot, that Polish people are a good nation. A smart one. So those are the facts. He's half an hour late. Maybe he won't come? Will he come? Can you repeat? Ah, you are deaf? I can hear a bit. But not too much. I'm terribly sorry I'm late. Don't worry, everyone will be admitted. Please come in. He's holding his hands. - Did you feel something? - You don't have to shout. I felt heat, as if his hands were electrical. He said I should come a couple more times and he will heal me completely. It's the third time we're in this town, and it still works. I'll catch a disease from all this touching. Tomorrow you're the healer. No way, you're already famous. And I'm an actor. An actor? You were cast as the queen's stool, in Radom. It's nice when a queen sits on you. Sorry, we're closed now. You're not. I'll be back in a month. I don't do abortions. Sorry, but it's against my beliefs. Touch your eyes, maybe you'll heal them. She came to see you 6 months ago. You touched her and this happened. He touched me more than once. Wait! What did he do? He left my sister pregnant, in my town. Oh, OK then. And who the fuck are you? A volunteer. He helps me with the healing. Out! If it's about money... - Did you sleep with her? - No... He's lying. Once. Twice. Same session. You'll pay for this. You're breaking my arm! All right, I'll pay alimony. You should sue the condom producer, though. Alimony? Things are different around here. What's more important to you, love or sex? Only love. Favorite book? "Anne of Green Gables". Why did you apply for this show? My mum said I'm young and intelligent and I will manage. Soup, my dying man. I was joking! You could get off your uniform, you've been off work for two years. This soup is too salty! It can't be, I outsmarted you and didn't add any salt. I'll show you, the salt shaker is full. JÃ³zio...! It was an accident! In the name of the Church, I ask you: Do you want, of your free will, to be married? Do you, Beata, want to marry Cezary? And swear to love him and be faithful, until death parts you? Yes, I want. Do you, Cezary, want to marry Beata, swear to love her and be faithful to her? No. No, I don't. Surely you won't kill me in a church! Goodbye. It could have been beautiful! We'll wait it out. Those guys have connections. And I have patience. They'll find you. And me as well. I'll call you when things calm down. And don't go to my flat to get the money! Are you crazy? I'm not suicidal. Where is he? Who? I won't ask you twice. I don't know. You should just take this. It's a lot of money. Tell me where he is... He's still alive! Call an ambulance! I'm sorry! I didn't notice it's slippery. Are you hurt? Can you get me to a hospital? Could you not inform the police? If it doesn't hurt too much. I got accepted for a TV show. This could end everything! And this show is a bit like a prison, so maybe it makes it up to you. Like a prison? Hello. I'm great. At everything. I can do everything. I like love and sex, war and peace. And I'm natural. A naturist. That girl who got accepted at the casting for women, Alina, she tried to run me over with a car. A very good way to get to know somebody. So? - What have you done recently? - Where? - In life. - In life? I wasn't there. I was on a cruise around the world. Thank you. Your profession? Sailor. But I'm also a bit of a handyman. What can you fix? Ships, mostly. Boats... - Water skis... - Yeah? - What do you sail with? - Me? A boat, mostly. What kind of boat? A Bols boat. - Are these the best you could find? - They're not that bad. - So there are no better ones? - No. Ok, then. Will they quarrel? For that 3 Poles are enough, and we have 10. Look. These are your 5 minutes. They can turn into years. Make it hard on them. OK? Look, they're going to drive us in a limousine! The house you're moving into is on an island, located on an artificial lake near a dam. The house is completely disconnected from the outside world. You'll spend a month there. If the viewers like it, the program will be extended by 2 months. If not, none of you gets the prize. So you should make an effort. The viewers will choose the winner. Cezary? Is something the matter? No! You look very bad. He's just afraid of water. The island can only be reached by boat. This is a strategic area, all water traffic is controlled. I'm Roman - face of the year of Fred's Underwear, 3 years ago. Cezary. Face of the century for condoms Breaker. Since ever. The show is operated from here by a small crew to ensure maximum privacy. All cameras are remotely controlled from the directing room. - No security guards? - No. By the way, a phone hidden in your socks was not the smartest idea, Roman. Huh? I can let you have it, there's no network here anyway. The bedrooms are over there. Those are the private rooms, if you need some intimacy. The kitchen. And this is the bathroom. - That is the bathroom? - What did you expect? There are doors in the toilets, though. More good news: We have decided to increase the prize to 2 million zloty. And: a special prize from our sponsors, a fabulous car. There is no Big Brother here, or anything like that. Contact me for all technical matters. Then you are you Big Sister. You could call me that. Our contact will be limited. You're supposed to manage on your own. Everybody knows the rules? What rules? Don't try to be funny. You'll have a whole month for that. The broadcasting starts in 3 hours. Does anybody have some soap? Shall we? In 40 seconds. Did you choose me for this job? I'm asking for a rise in alimony. You'll have to pay it somehow. You can't do that to me. I have to pay for my new apartment. And at our place... At my place they're changing the plumbing. Attention! We go in after the quiz. Ladies and gentlemen! In a moment we will start broadcasting from the island which now hosts our contestants. But before that, a quiz. In the movie "Dad", what was the role of Boguslaw Linda? a. Dad b. Grandma c. Wolf Do you think we're on? Look, I know you're not coming back. But can you at least tell me why you left? You were too good. - What's that? - A foreign word dictionary. - In my free time, I educate myself. - Can I borrow it? I want to learn a foreign language while I'm here. Why not introduce ourselves? To get to know each other. Monika has a obsession for hygiene. I'm grateful to Monika for the... what was it... amphitheater. Still at the letter "a"? It's a thick dictionary. What's an amphitheater, anyway? A theater where they sell amphetamine. So you can get drugs there? Sure thing. Anyone else want to introduce themselves? God, what have I gotten myself into? I know you are a talented driver. I wanted to say that I was a politician until now. So I know what it is to work for the people. I'll make myself useful. What party are you in, sir? We're supposed to speak informally, kid. I've been in several parties. In SLD I was an expert on coal and copper, in PSL on radio and TV, but I left and now I want to join the Civic Platform. Maybe you'll be an expert in oil platforms then. And who are you, funny guy? Zenon. Ex-plumber, currently unemployed. Tell us about yourself. He was telling lots of jokes on the set. I can show you the doll of my daughter. Mommy! Tell us something funny about yourself. I'm unemployed, my wife left me and took the kid, I was evicted from my flat, and recently my dog got run over. Ok, but why the long face? Wake up. Wanna see a naked lady? Can we turn this crap off? The match is on channel 2. I'm feeding your son, so I choose the channel. Unless you want to swap places. Beata, go get your mother! Good evening, boss. Don't worry. Let them get to know each other a bit. Of course it's going to be OK. After all, we have a mole. Enjoy. Thank you! I think my biggest asset is that I'm pretty. Agnieszka might have a better butt, but my face is prettier. What? I was supposed to say something about myself. Can't you behave? No! Too salty? This is going really well. Is there anything else? Well, anyway... It's healthy to skip dinner sometimes. You shut up. Hey, Big Sister! Can you hear me? We're hungry! More like Deaf-Mute Sister. Attention! There's a surprise for you in the pantry. - Are there steaks? - Not exactly. But it's also caloric. 2 million is a lot. Let's collaborate and share it. Leave me be, Fred. Make a deal with the politician and the caveman. Don't you realize you can secure your future for years to come? And for years back. I don't give a fuck. That's gonna kill him. Bottoms up! Cezary, stop it immediately. Why? He's just a politician. I remind you that it is not allowed to endanger other participants. And is it allowed to discuss Big Sister's breasts? It is. I think they are as big as the Big Sister herself. Can we get more vodka? I wanted to announce that we will be showering at 8:30. What was the protagonist's name in the last Polish action film? a. Pan Tadeusz b. Pan Klaudiusz c. Peter Pan Guys, wake up! I have tickets for the show! After this is over I want to be an actress. I'm not that ambitious. For starters, I'd like to be Playboy's "Playmate of the Summer". It seems to me it's your wife saying this...? She has to say that to win the money. She'd never get undressed in public. You know, I've been here for two days now, and I haven't thought about my husband even once? We'll have to get a divorce, son. I keep thinking about Roman. I dreamt of him last night. Yeah, Roman is hot. He's the best. If he doesn't choose me, I also like Cezary. And the politician. The politician has a wife and kids. So what? They're cool, except for the fat one. What's "cool"? The KUL university, in Lublin. Who allowed you to take pictures? Your eyes will fall off. It's your turn now. Get into the shower! We're a bit shy. Prefer to use a deodorant? I could go in my underwear. That's like not taking a bath at all. She's right. Take it off. I'll cover you. Yeah, sure. I'll look the other way. What are you pricks doing? Watching a porno? Before breakfast? Before cleaning the toilets? Before cleaning the floors? Before polishing your officer's shoes? Is there a black one? I will gladly take a bath with the ladies. With you especially. Don't worry. There's a nut for every bolt. Warm vodka for breakfast... Pour me some. There's not much left. Monika wants to be a film actress. With her skills, she could play the banjo. You mean jump on it. That's something you jump on. - Come on, eat something. - I'm on a diet. It doesn't matter how much you weight. Any girl... will find somebody to love her. I know. Really? Tell me, nobody's listening. I once fell in love with the mailman. And? And he loved me back. My husband was not doing well, he was fired after 20 years' work. And the postman was... very nice. - And? - And... He had amazing fingers. What finger is it? The fuck-you finger. Now we'll wrap the finger... That's the hand towel. Which makes it suitable! Thank you. Did you see that? The fat one cheated on her husband. Please, there's a Zanussi film on Channel 2. We're watching this! Hello? Wake up! Big Sister, does the TV work? We'd like to watch a movie. We've behaved so far, don't we deserve it? An outstanding movie, got a reward in Cannes. "Man of Marble". That movie is not transmitted by our channel. Of course, your channel only shows crap. Come on, just switch the channel for 2 hours. Just give me the remote, then it's not your fault. Too bad. If he keeps acting this way, he'll lose. The rules state clearly that all decisions concerning the majority of participants must be voted on. Guys, wanna watch TV? Raise your hand if you want to watch TV. What? Why do you think they put this screen here? They knew we'd want to watch something. So let's do it. You don't want to watch a movie? Roman, don't you want to watch a movie? - I could. - Then raise your hand. It's a cult movie. About a man who was skilled at his job, and his girlfriend who, like any girl, was calculating what's best for her. OK, that makes three of us. I've waited for this movie for a year! Agnieszka, have you seen this film? No. Then let's watch it! Can you imagine life under Stalin? No. Doesn't matter. It's mostly a movie about love. Thanks. Zenon? I know I didn't share the vodka, but it's not going to happen again. You are the one who remembers it best. The best years of your life. Picking potato bugs, that kind of thing. It's about a bricklayer, that's almost like a plumber, right? Ok, have it your way. I understand your wife now. Euzebiusz... I won't ask you. Karina, Monika? I don't feel too good. Maybe it's food poisoning. I don't like this film. Because it's about decent people? Come on.. Cezary, your time is up. You can do the dishes. What do you mean, time's up? Who decides that? I do. Guys, are we going to let this voice lead us by the nose? Enough! They locked us up, they watch us while we shower, but they can't decide on everything. - Cezary... - This is not in the rules! What? We made it! Do you see that, Big Sister? That makes 50%. It's not a majority. It's not a minority, either. Start the movie, or I'll break the fucking screen. If you do that, you're out from the show. A bricklayer is like a plumber. We have a majority! What do you say, you harsh voice? Please, play "The Man of Marble". Maybe your roommates want to watch something else? What do you mean? We want the film. There's a ski jumping competition in Salt Lake City. Adam Malysz is taking part. Who would prefer that? Come on, you wanna watch what everyone else does? By some herd instinct? But... it's boring. 125m. Gimme a break. How does it compare to a masterpiece? Malysz is my hobby. Fuck Malysz. You're in the way. - Did he win? - I don't know. He's great, but too much love will kill him. They made him into a national barbie doll. - What's that? - No idea, go get the net! Put it in the water and hold it. - It's going to bite us! - Easy, girl! Did someone order lunch? How do you like it? Fried, cooked? - Fried. - Baked in salt. Nice catch, but this is against the rules. What do you mean? Try and stop me from eating it. You can't eat anything that we didn't check first. Apologies. Please throw away the sander. It's a pike, you idiot! A pike! We caught it with Alina and now we're going to bake it. Please throw away the pike. Don't be so mean. This fish is fresh. Good morning. I bring your income support. Is it my fault it's so low? This is an assault! Good morning. Wake up. Time for your morning workout. Monika, get up! Do you hear? Monika! The fat one. Must have looked at the mirror. Don't touch her. Go back to the room, I'm coming. It might sound weird, but I'm glad you-re crying. I knew from the start that you are... We have a problem. Your friend... I'm afraid she's dead. A collapse. The doctor will give the true version after autopsy. The true version? Stop nitpicking! I'm upset as well. So what now? The viewers didn't see anything. We have 3 minutes to decide. To decide what? We need to stop this and go home. You wanna quit? Why would we quit? Is it my fault she died? Right, it was pure chance. It just happened. So the viewers can't see us now? No, they can't. But we are going live in a minute. What if she was poisoned? They said it was a collapse. Who would poison her? People kill for a buck or two. Enough nonsense. We're running out of time. If two or more people want to quit, we cancel the show. There's one more thing. In case you choose to stay, you'll have to sign this. So if anyone else dies we can't quit? You can. Anytime. But you'll have to pay a compensation. We can't allow for constant mood changes. Whoever poisoned her might do it again. Nobody poisoned her! It was an accident. Make up your mind if you want to make it to the end. I know you liked Monika and you're going to miss her. But we invested big money in this. We want to get it back. I need a decision. I think we should quit. Are you with me? Yes. - But I can't get out of here. - Damn right you can't. I have nowhere to go. - But in these circumstances... - I'm sorry. Smart decision. Let's do this: we'll make the viewers think Monika left by herself. You'll have to act as if she was still here. Meaning? We'll add her into the image. Digitally. You'll get a script with her itinerary. How can you do this? We have our ways. I know something about miracles. They don't exist. I think they're going to kill each other for money. Of course not. - Would you kill me for money? - No. Because you have no money. It's nice to sit together like this. Monika, maybe that's enough showering? Good. She's out. Why are you going to the bedroom? - To the kitchen! - ...to the kitchen? She must have forgotten her hairbrush. In the kitchen? Come join us, there's nothing left in the fridge. Maybe she's looking for her hairbrush! - It's not in the fridge! - I think it is in the fridge. Some people freeze their hairbrush to prevent oily hair. She's getting a snack for the road. You're not going anywhere. You're going to hit her! Son of a bitch, we didn't fool him. I'll kick him out of the show. I guess I killed her. How's your miracle factory? Will I get a life sentence? What are they forcing them to? I didn't know your wife's so heartless. If it was my friend who died, I would have quit. So you'll buy us a flat with your pension, so we can move out? Excuse me, Sir. If you'll excuse my language. I'm sorry, but I think they're fucking with them. And now, we have a surprise for you. Our guest tonight is... Monika! Welcome! Tell us how you feel about what happened. You mean me dying? Great. I think it makes the show more interesting and challenging for the participants. Right. We are testing them in an admittedly radical way. What are your thoughts on Cezary's drop in popularity? Infographics: The first drop is when he criticized Malysz. The next steep decline is when he didn't support Zenek and decided to stay after your death. I think Cezary pretends not to care too much, but in reality he just wants the money, as is now clear. So who poisoned the lady who later lived? Nobody did, since she lives. So she wasn't poisoned. But she was dead before. That's just TV gimmicks. It's not the truth. That's right. So what is truth? Truth is... what you can see with your eyes. I saw her die and then live. Attention... Big Sister has a task for you. Time for the last two duels in our fighting tournament: In the featherweight/middleweight category: Cezary and Alina! Why did you say you can't leave? For two reasons. What are you doing? Sorry, I got distracted. What reasons? Stop it or I'll hit back! Go ahead. There's nowhere to hit you. You're all soft. Not everyone out there is my friend. And besides... Besides, what? Besides, this. Piece of shit, already looking for the next one! I promise you, when I get the fucker... - Mind your language! - You'll have his balls. She already had them. Time for the final fight! Our heaviest contestants are going to be wood-breaking! This was the bread cutting board. Come! Be careful not to kill him. Go for it! Hit me! Hit me! - You fat cow, you tried to kill me. - Sorry. What did you call me? You're dangerous, you aimed at my temple. Please step back, the pipe broke diagonally. Can you fix it? We'll see. What will we see? Whether this can be fixed. How can we know that? We'll see. Did you really stay because of me? Kind of. Really? As a kid I always wanted to be on an island like this. Find a treasure. Your mum read to you "Treasure Island"? I'm from an orphanage. You're all alone. I had a younger brother. "Had"? When he was 6 he was electrocuted. He was in a bathtub, the stupid nanny was listening to the radio... And the radio fell in the bathtub. I don't even remember him well. I'm still afraid of water and electricity. - But you like fishing. - From the shore. And I stopped believing in treasure islands. Maybe there is an island with an undiscovered treasure. Yes. There is one, here. And I've just discovered it. Attention, I have a surprise for you. Tomorrow morning you will be allowed to meet... your families. Mum is coming! Beata, get my shoes! Doing fine with Alina. You'll take her to the private room? She's not like that. I'll take Agnieszka. But if you take Alina, we should choose rooms. Take whichever. Left or right? - Right. - Whose right? Whichever you like. Ok, so my right. So that means my left. Who's there? Can you say something? You scared me, you can stop hiding now. OK, I'm turning on the light. - Why are you shouting? - It's foreplay. Go now. Can you leave me with my fiancee? You know what? There are those private rooms. Maybe we could go to the one on the... left. You want me to go to a private room with you? - You can stay here, I'm going to bed. - Want me to go to bed with you? I just said I'm going to the private room. My mum is watching this show. Well, stay here then, or go back to your bedroom. See you, then. My leg! - Sorry. Agnieszka? - An idiot? No, Cezary. Where are your clothes? Are you in there, baby? Oh no, Roman is going to kill me. Agnieszka, are you in there? I don't know! I mixed up the rooms, the left one and the right one. Not just you. Were you talking? I heard something. Me? - You! - No. Let's go for a walk. Now? When I finally found the right room? I don't like it with the light on. - Why not? - I have a tattoo you may not like. - What kind of tattoo? - An ugly one. - Where is it? - Here. - I meant the tattoo. - Also here. And what's this? A soft bone. I mean, a hard on. Cezary, are you there? If you're not, I'm going! I'm here! I must have mixed up the rooms. I checked the other one first. We must have a serious conversation. - It's an outbreak. - What are you doing here? I'm lying. On the floor, unlike you. Cezary! We're all in here. But I've the short end of the stick. They break my nose, in 4-second intervals. What is he doing here? Maybe he lost something. I'm coming! It was a pleasure being under you. Don't worry, love. Anyone can get the rooms mixed up. Colonel? I'm really sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to remind you we're supposed to test the new cannon. Well, test it. - But we're all here. - Send the new recruits to do it. OK, I fell in love with you. But don't expect anything more. - Nothing? Or more? - Listen... I don't want you to hide anything from me. I won't hide I'd prefer you didn't have any pants on. I can take them off, I have tights underneath. Let's start with that. We'll make further deals. Report that the cannon works fine. That's not the way you woke me up when we were married. I don't remember. How's it going? Everybody's alive. He's a lousy negotiator. She knows what she's doing. Wake them up. Visits in half an hour. - What are you doing? - Fixing it. It broke down yesterday. And the pipe is leaking again. Good thing there was no accident. My little bunny! I miss you! Me too! Does your mother badmouth me much? Not at all, she's your fan! Dump that model! I am your girlfriend! I haven't done anything! You haven't? OK, then. You're doing great! Everything's fine. Why did you come then? My friends mock me because you're often naked. But I'm proud of you! Of you and your breasts. Nobody came? Wanna play? I don't know how. I'll teach you. Her fingers are too fat to shuffle properly. You know what? I could kill you for this. You tried once already. This time I'm prepared. I didn't try. Cezary, report to the harbor. Your family has come. - I don't have a family. - Go immediately. Alina! My daughter! The whole country is flooded! Are you safe here? Mum, I met a really nice guy! So I've seen! He's really nice and honest. I think it can be serious. He has feelings for me. Cezary, you didn't tell us somebody is coming to visit you. Because nobody came. They did! - Do you know her? - Nope. Hi, Cezary! Dunno her. Cezary! Our child is a girl! I went to the hospital and they said they don't see a weenie! Did you hear me? I was a bit upset when they released you after raping me. But what really pissed me off was when you refused to marry me! What rape? I was in jail for something else. So you do hear me! Good. Greetings from my family! We're all waiting for you! I can't hear you at all. But from your lips I guess you confused me with somebody else. You were also confused when you fucked me on the table? Excuse me. I got emotional. Cezary, I can see you concealed some things from us. Listen, I know your network is capable of anything. But you can't do this to people. I'll write to my local representative about it! Fuck this. I ran out of patience, I'll kill the fucker. Will Cezary marry pregnant Beata? What does Alina have to say? She spent the night with Cezary. Get to know about it after the break. And now, a quiz. What is the title of the Polish film which won the Grand Prix in the Moscow Film Festival? a. Life as a fatal sexually transmitted disease b. Life as gonorrhea c. Deadly sperm cells So we can eat fish as long as I didn't catch it. Why don't you eat? Listen, I don't know that ugly hag. Must be some nutcase. Cezary, in the pantry you'll find some pictures from your would-be wedding with Mrs. Beata. Ok, I met her briefly. I didn't rape her. She was screwing everyone. She may be pregnant, but I'm not the father. But you were in jail. Who's talking about jail? Cezary, we just checked you record. We regret doing it this late. You were in jail for 2 years, for fraud. It wasn't fraud. I work with my hands. The court didn't believe me. You claimed to be a healer and scammed people. You're far better than me when it comes to scamming. We are discussing your removal from the show for breaking the rules. But I believe it should be up to all participants to decide. - You lied also to them. - Let's vote. Lift your arms. It's just a fish bone, love. Help her, if you're a healer. I only heal serious illnesses. You can't heal shit. Try to help her. I'll call a doctor. He'll be here in an hour. Where is it stuck? Breathe. I'm right here. Breathe through the nose. One. Two. Three. Oh my, he made it. Let's get you some fresh air. Thanks. That was great acting. You humiliated me in front of my mum and millions of people. Cezary, Alina, your microphones are off. I slept with her, but it's not my child. Why should I believe you? Can I come get a hug? - For old times's sake... - There's a couch for you. I'll turn on the autopilot. Goodnight. We don't broadcast at night. If anything happens we'll deal with it tomorrow. Ok, if you find the idea repelling... Show me Camera 2! And start recording! - Fuck! - We'll fuck later. Show the camera on the wall. I want all the angles. Zoom in on his face. I didn't expect this. Interesting... I didn't know we had more than one mole. What did you say? That I didn't know we had more than one mole. We don't. Jesus Christ. - Maybe he just fainted. - Are the others asleep? How can we not have a doctor here? We are cut off form the world like in Alcatraz. - What if somebody chokes on a fish bone? - Calm down. - I'm going there. - I'll go. You call the boss. It looks like a simple case. Heart attack? No. He was poisoned. I wonder what happened. I hope no one died. That's the last thing he drank. I'm sorry to say this, but we're done. What do you mean, done? - This one really is dead! - Really? Do you even know what "really" means? I don't know what I did to deserve this, but God has been merciful on me. That's the best "really" I could have imagined. And this means, my children, that the heavens just dropped a few million dollars on me. The last ones to use the fridge were Cezary and Alina. Do they look like murderers to you? Murderers? Leave that to me. Attention! Euzebiusz had some stomach issues and had to resign from the show. He will be replaced by a new participant, Piotr. See? I told you Euzebiusz is fine. It's just the TV messing with us. A terrible thing happened. One of the participants is really dead. Heard what he said? "Ugly hag". He's making a fool of us. We know where he is, why don't we just kill him? They film everything, son. What would a real corpse look like on TV? Like that! It is up to you to decide whether the show should continue. You can vote using the two phone numbers displayed. - It's on. - Who? The National Broadcasting Council. CEO speaking. Warm greetings for the deputy! You're not a deputy anymore? No problem, you'll be one again. Which show? Good show, right? Record audiences. What was that? What? You want me to pull back a show that has... 64.5% market share and going up. Did you hear that? You know how many people voted for the show to go on? I'll tell you. Above 97% in favor. It seems we're not understanding each other. A fine? Who cares, I'll pay your fine. Who will let you shut down the station two months before the elections? Which political party is gonna vote for that, huh? Find me one that will. Goodbye. We're going to Warsaw. The lawyers ready? Yes. Gotta go to Parliament too. I'm not afraid of those. Dorota, keep an eye on things. And remember you have the most popular show ever in this country. All for a couple of cents. That's the kind of show we'll do from now on. Where are the mortars to ship to Macedonia? In the storage room, by the stove. Yo, what's up? I'm Piotr. Hey, buddy. I'll take your luggage to your room. You go take a shower. What are you waiting for? Everybody has to take a shower first, it's a rule. Look! What a naughty boy! Isn't that mine? Sure it's yours. I see you're into kinky stuff. - Give it back. - Sure, man. Now each of us has one free hand. - Very funny. Open it. - No. OK. Girls, could you turn around? No! Come on, our friend is shy. - Stop it, or I'll harm you. - You'd have to let your dick go first. - I'm warning you. - It must be tiny, I need two hands to cover mine. - The keys! - Let him go! You're hurting him. Don't talk, hit him with a chair. - Don't you dare. - It would be assault on a policeman. Junior officer Piotr... You pervert. Don't touch me. Could someone explain to me what's going on? I'll explain. He's a cop. For some reason they've sent a cop here. I give you 5 seconds to guess why. To make it more interesting. Bravo. Great theory. But I think he's here because one of you killed Euzebiusz. I want to tell you one thing. - Is it about your dick? - Stop fooling around. Euzebiusz died from stomach problems. Poisoning. It would be nice if you told us who poisoned him. Somebody poisoned him, most likely. I am here to solve this case. And to ensure your safety. Because if he was poisoned, it was done by one of you. The toxin was potassium disulfate. Easily made if you know how. Remember "Ten Little Niggers"? No. A novel by Agatha Christie. About ten people on an island who get murdered one by one. Good thing we're all white. I know all about Christie. - You know how to plan a murder, then. - Sure. Come on. Nobody can leave until the case is closed. So we must wait until Zenon kills us all? - Me? - One of us. If he murders us all, he's gonna get caught. But he'll win the money. Psychopaths don't care if they're caught. All they want is fame. Then we're all psychopaths here. I'm sure you're a world expert on psychopaths. Judging by your criminal record, you should be the one to know. Let me give you some advice. Never trust a convict. Everybody in their rooms? The cop's looking at them. We're in trouble. It'll be raining for a week. Have you seen the water level? There'll be a flood and we'll be cut off. Very imaginative. We'll be stuck here with some madman. I'll be here. Why did you take this job? To look at boobs on camera? Maybe. To be honest, I haven't yet forgotten yours. Stay in your rooms at night. I'll be making a round each hour. Damn. Our defender broke his leg. Don't be afraid. It's me. Meet me at the private room, I'll explain everything. - I won't. - OK. But you'll be missing out. I've waited all my life to meet someone like you. You're... There's something about you. Use your female intuition, I've heard you women have it. Leave me alone. I'll be waiting. So... I wanted to tell you... Alina? Alina? Is that you? Listen... I know I have my flaws. But I love you and I will never hurt you. I know you're upset at the fact that I wasn't honest with you. But now I promise that... Cezary. I believe you. Really? Yes. Oh, come on... I'm gonna kill him. Don't leave me alone! I'll be back after I shut it up. Roman, stop fooling around. Get up. Oh my God... Don't shout or I won't release you. When I came here he was lying there. I slipped and landed on top of him. I wanted to revive him. Do you believe me? Alina, darling! I'm not a murderer! I don't want to lose you due to false appearances. So please, don't shout. I'll let you go now and we'll talk. OK, shout all you want. Let them all come here and see us covered in blood next to Roman. What will they think when they see you with blood on your face? I'll tell them you bit his throat. You know I didn't kill him. Sorry. Wait. Calm down. We have to get rid of these clothes. - Hide it! - Where? The water is rising. We'll drown before they kill us. - Cezary. - What? Everything's been recorded. They know who did it. Oh, God. Thanks. Seems like he was successful this time with Alina. Rewind! That's the killer. He covered his face. It's just somebody covered with a blanket. What does this mean? One second. Show me where's the guy with the blanket. - It's not recorded. - What? But we record everything. - We are. But you turned it off. - I did? Your body did. Your shoe turned it on for a bit. Oh, God. Luckily something was recorded. Hello? Hello? Did you see what happened? And you did nothing? I must tell you that upsets me. I'm coming for you. Call the policeman. That guy? - Open the door! - You can't go in there. You can't come in here. Get out, or you're out of the show. OK. But first tell me who killed Roman. Get out or I'll call security. There are no guards here. - Who killed him? - Don't play stupid. Want to see the tape? That's why I took the door down! Show him. I slipped and fell. Show me what's before that. - Earlier? - Don't play stupid. Rewind the tape. No. - No? - We had a technical problem. That's all we recorded. But you saw what happened. - No. - We were... busy. Busy? You're messing with me. You have recorded a total of 15 seconds tonight... precisely when I strangle him? Seemingly! The machine broke down. And it had to happen precisely so it looks like I attacked Roman? You can't frame me, I didn't do it. - Weren't you with him? - He left the room for a moment, to stop the doll from crying. Then I heard a noise, as if someone fell. And when I came out I saw Cezary strangling Roman. That is, sitting on him after slipping. Why didn't you record it? It's some new TV trick, right? Can I see your shoes? Shoes? Sure. What the fuck is this? Go find another scapegoat. I'm fed up. I'm calling the boss. And the police. They should send a real team, not some amateur. Jesus Christ, the body is gone. What will it be now? The only suspect is me, on that tape of theirs. Well, well. I see our Holy Virgin has made her move. Mum's gonna get shocked. Have you seen Roman? He's gone. Gone. To the room? Gone in peace. And with peace. Someone removed the body. Rewind it. - I didn't start the recording. - What? You fucking amateur, I can't believe I hired you. You turned it off with your ass! Stop it! Stop it! I'll make it look like there was a technical problem. The important part is on tape. You'll agree with me, or we're fired. Check the other one. Must be the flood. BREAKDOWN The emergency power will now turn on. How long will it last? A few hours, if we cut energy consumption. We have to tell them. Let them lock him up. If he really did it. What do you mean? We have it on tape. The camera doesn't lie. Then how did he hide the body? He was here. - Maybe he has a partner. - Or maybe it wasn't him. Now they're watching each other. Have you seen my doll? Damn. A bit of rain, and all this rocket technology goes to hell. Ever heard of floods? This "bit of rain" can destroy cities. And you complain they don't bother with a broken transition tower. Big Sister, there is no water. Attention please. The electricity is out. The problem is probably caused by the rising water level. I can't find Roman anywhere. The flood has caused a lot of damage. Large regions of south-west Poland are flooded. The dam in Borowiec is at risk. The crew, supported by the army, are in a heroic fight against the weather. You should split into pairs and search the area. - I'm not going anywhere. - There's no time for arguing. Seems one of you is missing. Now I can tell you that Euzebiusz was murdered. One of you did it. I'm not going out. Enough. Agnieszka goes with Karina. Ala goes with the politician. Make sure you can see each other at all times. - You were right, we should have left. - It's never too late. Now I'd have to swim, only I don't know how. Even if you swam you wouldn't get anywhere. The water's too cold, the current's too strong. But there's a boat at the pier. So you found the doll? When I woke up in the morning, she was by my bedside. But in the morning you asked if we've seen it. So? Then I guess I found it later. That's your shirt. I saw you wearing it. So what if it's mine? It doesn't prove anything. Anyone could take it from the laundry room. - No trace of him? - He's not around. Maybe he's hiding. It's getting dark. They'll evacuate us if the water keeps rising, right? Print a photo of what we taped, if you still can. What about Roman? We won't do anything? If he's alive and hasn't left, we'll find him. If he were alive, we'd have found him by now. I won't sit with the lot of you. You're so calm. And yet one of you murdered him. We just keep an eye on each other. They'll evacuate us, right? There's something I must tell you. The connection with Warsaw is lost. Soon I won't see you anymore. I won't be able to talk to you. The cameras are turning off. But if you stick together, everything will be all right. Maybe you should join us, Big Sister. - I can't hear you. Where is Agnieszka? - In the room. I'll go get her, she shouldn't be alone. Agnieszka? Agnieszka, wait! Why did I sign up for this? - For the money, perhaps? - No. I didn't believe I'd win. I hope someone would notice me, maybe offer some work. You don't know what it's like to sit all day with your mother-in-law in a tiny apartment. Because there's no work. And there's nowhere to go. I'd just wait for my husband to come home. I'd wait at the window an hour in advance. Agnieszka told me she came because her boyfriend said he'd kill himself if she leaves him. She was afraid he'd do it, and she didn't want to be there if it happens. - No, she just wanted to be famous. - So did I. - It's harder to kill a famous person. - What do you mean? And I'm here because... You know... I wasn't lucky, either in love or at work. - Same for me. - And me. I wanted my children to know their father was worth something. That he could do more than mess up their mother's life. I messed up even the life of my dog. But maybe now... I'll start a new life? No, Zenon. I have a husband. I'll go back to him after this is finished. And I'll keep using too much salt. Why? I'm the only person he can talk to during lunch. Even if it amounts to arguing over salt. Do you think one of us is capable of murder just to get the money and change our lives? Alina? - Well, then. They're not here. - We go look for them. Oh, no. We were supposed to stick together. We already split. See what he's doing? He's splitting the group. I'm going there. We should be able to search the whole area in 30 minutes. I'm not going anywhere. - Two of you friends are out there. - They're not my friends. Who else doesn't care? Hold on. No one is going out. We wait for morning. Try and stop me. I'm coming with you. Let's split. Go right and make a round. We meet here. Attention. We don't have much time, so just listen. Cezary is the killer. That's why he wants you outside. - Oh, stop it. - Shut up. There is no time to argue. We need to stop him. Piotr! Where were you? I was looking for Agnieszka. But... She might be his accomplice. Come here, doll. Did you see him murder Roman? He didn't kill anybody, it was an accident. - She knows it. - I know what I see. He didn't do it, it's a misunderstanding. How do you know? Did you see it? Did you see what happened before that scene? Are you certain he didn't do it? I don't know. So allow yourself to doubt. As for us, we are sure. Come, darling. You can't know for sure. Give her some medication. What will you do to him? You fucking murderer! It kind of got out of hand, huh? He'll be all right. What will you do when he comes to himself? We need to lock him up. He's a dangerous beast. We're not safe while he's around. We can't drown him. I'll tell you what we'll do. Guys! Guys, I didn't kill anyone! The killer's still in the house! Sleep tight. I hope this nightmare will be over by tomorrow. And... I have to say it's a pity we didn't record all this. Can someone help me get to my room? Tell me he can't break free! She's asleep now. I told her you didn't harm him. - We regret that. - How is she? She asked if the results are still valid if the show's off, so I guess she's getting better. Isn't that weird? Some spotlights are still on. They've a different power supply. - Can't we connect that to... - The cameras! - Let's go backstage. - Aren't you afraid? Why should I? Is that you? Wait! DON'T TOUCH ELECTRICAL HAZARD Stop it! Let me explain. A short-circuit? It's just the fuses... I'll try to connect everything and then we'll fix it. Give me 3 second before you kill me. I was playing dead in order to find the killer and win the show. You won't believe how much you can learn being invisible. Let's turn them on, one by one, and we'll see. So what did you see? I know who's the killer, you won't believe it. Electricity! We're in the water, it'll kill us! Turning on second phase. We'll fly away with all this energy. - Where did you hide the rag? - What rag? You spilled the oil for Piotr to slip. You knew they'd blame me. Are you crazy? Fuck, you'll get us killed. There's electricity. But it's not here. Show your face, motherfucker! - Don't shoot! - Don't move. I'm innocent. Listen to me for a minute, then you can kill me. I'm listening. Put that away! Thanks. Roman is alive. Well, he was alive 10 minutes ago. You're lying. Somebody electrocuted him when he fell into the water. That person wanted to kill me. - Who's gonna believe you? - You're a policeman, right? You have to protect me and my girl. How are you going to explain when tomorrow they find Roman in the water... electrocuted? Someone else is the killer and he's in this house. You don't have to believe me, but you must check if it's true. Otherwise more people could die. I guess I know who tried to kill me a moment ago. This person wants to kill us all. Who? You! Ladies and gentleman, this dick tried to kill me today. He's delirious. Sorry to interrupt. I present to you the killer. How did you get loose? Lower that gun. No problem. Ask him, what was he doing outside, with his broken leg? - Careful, it's loaded! - Don't move. Sweating hard, are you? How's your leg? Stop it! He'd jump to the ceiling if it were broken. An innocent person died because of you. Who? - I'll tell you later. - Roman. What? That's not true. It's not true, right? It's not true. But it was close. Great timing! I'm sorry, pal, I'm really sorry. Earlier, I was trying to tell you it's him. Don't move. - Did you do military service? - Yeah. Then aim at him. I might shoot myself. - Listen... - Shut up or he'll shoot you. My leg isn't broken. And I've been outside. But I was doing an investigation! This guy tried to kill me 30 minutes ago. Are you sure it was me? Did you see his face? Stop your political nonsense! He's the killer. Right, I'm the killer. I'm going to kill you all. First, I killed Euzebiusz. Correct. Using telepathy. Because when he was poisoned, I was 300km away, you moron. It was supposed to go smoothly. Oh, no. Oh, yes. You are an idiot. Now everyone will go to the men's bedroom. I don't have to add that if you don't, I'll shoot. What do you mean, Roman? Get in there, or I'll make you! There are just precautions. For your safety and mine. Shut the door! I knew you'd come. You'll be my hostage, ok? - Excuse me? - Are you deaf, you idiot? Come here! Don't go near him. Shut up, or I'll kill her now instead of in 5 minutes. And you move your ass, get some gasoline and set it all on fire. Nice cooperation. Not even a cop can resist that much money. No one can resist that. But we're just having fun, right? It was supposed to be different, but you appeared and spoiled it all. Naughty boy. And you, did you have to lie soaked in bed? I had to get wet cause you were supposed to die. You're right. I forgive you. This time. Come here, girl. Everybody'll burn but you. You're gonna drown. I'll go away in a boat, I'm dead anyway. Piotr lives to blame Cezary. And Cezary lives so he can be guilty. An ex-convict is perfect for that. You forget the TV crew. They must survive, to confirm you're a crazy psycho. They have it on tape. A few seconds, but it's enough. So you have to live. And what will you say if I don't? Well, that's interesting. Right? Stop, you idiot! Attention everyone. Electricity is back. We're on air again. I aimed at his leg. You couldn't strangle him, so now you finished him off. I just wanted to... immobilize him. That was murder in cold blood. You were his partner. Ala heard everything. Who will believe your lover? Put the gun down. You won't murder me while millions watch? Put the gun on the ground and step back. Do it! I won't, Piotr. You wanted to have fun. So let's have fun. It will be... a show. Cezary, lower the gun. We are on air, it's all on camera. You'll be in deep trouble. Give me the gun, it'll be an extenuating circumstance. I don't believe one could prove you guilty. Cezary! That's how you kill, gentlemen... How you kill killers. But there is one left. Wait! I just... don't care anymore. No! It was all Roman's idea. I knew him from the army. When I got here, he convinced me to help him. To help... Fuck, I can't take it anymore. You fucked up, we could've pulled it off a bit longer. Pull it off! I almost peed myself when you told me to fetch gasoline. "Get gasoline and set it on fire"! What were you thinking? There's no fucking gasoline here. Attention. Everyone please gather in the main room. - Can you tell me what's going on? - One second. Yes, boss? No problem, I'll talk to her. Did you close the floodgate? We could really get flooded. See you. God, I don't even know what's being aired and what not. Or when. We've been on air all the time. All the time. You don't know what it's like to sit all day with your mother-in-law in a tiny apartment. I have a husband. I'll go back to him. And I'll keep using too much salt. I love you, fatty. I thought I'd suffocate in there. Turn it off. Who said it's only participants who fuck in reality shows? - What is "reality" supposed to be? - Why? So that it's more dramatic, interesting, fun, true. Why did you do this to me? I want to buy a flat downtown. Besides, I'm mean. Glad to see you, you piece of shit. I'm also glad. Won't you ask me how I'm doing? - How could you do this to me? - That's enough. This is what you're going to say on air now. You will say it smiling. Or she will. We are impressed. You were amazing. You can now greet your families, who were watching you all the time. Mum! We will win! We will win! Man, you were amazing. - I was? - Sure! You're gonna win this show. In the polls you're now ahead of Alina. - Yeah? - Sure, those 2 million are yours. You're a national hero now. Better then Malysz. We did it together. We were great! Mum, do you see me? - Pack your things, let's get outta here. - Come on, nothing happened. Nothing happened? I killed a man. So what if he's alive? I've done some terrible things in life. I scammed people. Sold them illusions. But I never even hit anybody. And you forced me to... to want to kill somebody. You didn't have to kill me. We had prepared other options. Are we on air? Yes. - Very good. - I can cut at any moment. I'll tell you when. Get a grip. Do you realize how many people watched you? You can't kill your fans. Don't you realize what an authority you are? Authority? Authority: gravity, influence, importance, person in command, arbiter, expert, oracle, master. I am an authority? That means a guy who tried to kill someone is an authority. A guy who made a couple of bad jokes when he was afraid. And you know what? That's how it is. You just need to be on TV. And if I had dyed my hair green, and I were handsome, we'd find a better word for that in this dictionary. Object of devotion? Idol? A long time ago... you didn't need to have... a Hugo Boss t-shirt and a BMW to tell a girl you love her. "Four Tank-men and a Dog" was on TV and everything was easy. I remember a film about a bricklayer who wanted to be honest and did his job well. "Man of Marble". And this man of marble, that's an authority. Because he didn't care about others, he just wanted to build houses. And I'm an authority? Because I was capable of shooting someone? On TV? And I was in jail at some point? I don't think so. But compared to what you do I have a clear conscience. You can't leave. You signed a contract. You don't know how to swim. We can use this to get to the mainland. The flood was canceled. - Cezary... - Do you know I'll love you forever? I'm sure of it. I'm staying. Don't worry, this door is unsinkable. I thought long about it, I even dreamed of it. And I think we don't fit together. I went out to look for you. In the dark, and... They could have killed me. I have a good chance of winning. I love you very much. But we wouldn't be a good couple. I'm too sensitive for you. - But you had free food here. - Someone has to keep you from drowning. - Can you change the baby? - Not now. I knew he was no healer the first time I went to see him. Because he said he doesn't know how to do abortions. Where are the boys? They took some boxes, loaded it on the truck and went somewhere. We'll sink the fucking island. You know, I have a gift. You were in jail for it. So what? This nation loves to believe in this crap. Everything will go to hell, but two forces are indestructible. Us and TV. Maybe not in that order. I just have to teach you to play deaf. What? Authority: gravity, influence, importance, person in command, arbiter, expert, oracle, master. Fuck authority. I'm here, in this show, to avoid paying alimony. But I'm bored of watching your stupid faces. So I'm taking my buddy, the alcoholic, and off we go. Maybe we should move to Czechia? There was a feeling between us, but I acted for my own good. We parted amicably, that's the important part. Attention. The latest polls show Alina is leading, with 80% chance of winning. This is amazing. So amazing! I've never had so much fun in my life. We will win! We will win! You think someone will pick us up? We can always go for a walk. Subtitles by bruno321 @ KG
