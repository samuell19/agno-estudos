-[alarm blaring] -[steam hissing] [electricity buzzes] [dramatic music playing] [electronic music playing] [German man] What is art? Is it a painting on a wall or a sculpture in a museum? Or is it more? Is it something greater than all of us? [monkey screeches] [German man] Who makes art? -[upbeat techno music playing] -[motorcycle engine revving] [German man] Where does it come from? [flute playing] [German man] What is its purpose? Why are we compelled to create? What is art? -[music turns whimsical] -[German man] Art is connection. Art is passion. Art is love. [explosion] -[waves crashing] -[dramatic music plays] [Chris] Can perfection be obtained? -Is it possible for us to find? -[seagulls squawking] [Chris] One Matt seeks to find these answers. Matt will search for the perfect Matt on this season of... -The Mattchelor! -[upbeat music playing] [Chris] On this season... Everybody, meet Matt. [Matts cheer] Hey, everyone. I'm here to find my perfect Matt. -[cheering] -Me too! -That's me, that's me! -[laughs] -[Angry Matt] Whoo! Yeah, baby. -[laughs] Right here, Matt! Right here, Matt.

This is not gonna be easy. Matt, I think it goes without saying that-- May the best Matt win! [all cheering] This Matt has got it in the bag! I have a perfect body, I have a perfect mind. It's not about winning. [Party Matt] Everybody's always like, "I'm not here to make friends." Who else you gonna drink with? By yourself? [all cheer] [Matt] I did not expect to connect so well with so many of these Matts. [Model Matt] You can't be jealous in a game like this. For this Matt on Matt getaway, I choose... Matt, Matt... and Matt. [confused muttering] You? This is gonna be interesting. -[Matts chattering] -That's a good choice, Matt. [chuckles] Yeah. If only you were Matt Handsome. [both laugh] [Influencer Matt] At first, I was like, 100 percent chance. Now, I'm like, hundred and one percent chance. -[dramatic music playing] -[seagulls squawking] -[Chris] Things get spicy. -[flame igniting] Oh, I'm gonna hook up with as many Matts as possible. Let's neck. Things get dicey. -[Zumba Matt] Matt... -[Angry Matt screaming] ...has serious anger problems. -[bleep] you! [bleep] you! -[screams] What the [bleep] did you just say to me? [Musician Matt] He was running all over the place like a madman. -[Angry Matt groans] -[bleep] boinkin' it. -Hey, hey! Whoa! -[Matts scream] [Model Matt] Oh! Pretty good throw. -Matt! Matt! -[laughs] [Angry Matt] Stop! Stop laughing! Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! [Party Matt] I'm all fun and games until... -You wanna go? [groans] -...I'm not fun and games. [indistinct clamoring] [Influencer Matt] Matt, stop it, stop that, stop that! -[screaming] -[gurgles] [indistinct clamoring] And things get a little crazy. [all] Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! -Go! Go! Go! -[rolls tongue] [all] Go! Go! Go! -[Matts cheering] -[music builds] -[music stops] -[all breathing heavily] [Musician Matt] Yank my chain, baby. [exhales] [birds chirping] But there can only be one perfect Matt. -[whimsical music playing] -[seagull squawking] Matt, you know I played football in high school, right? I was quarterback. I have to take a page out of one of my favorite Matt's books, Matt Saracen from Friday Night Lights. Blue 42! Blue 42! -Matt, I love you! -[clears throat] Look, I just want you to know, because we care about you, that Matt and I saw Matt and Matt hooking up in the Matt tub. Matt thinks Matt likes Matt more than I like Matt, and that's just bloody ridiculous. Who? Matt? -[dramatic music playing] -You're a liar and a snake, and no one [bleep] trusts you! I'm not even sure your name's really Matt! -[gasps] -Now, I know you're just intimidated because I'm a male model. Oh, really? For what? Creepy Music Conductors Illustrated? Yes, I've worked with them before. -[Matt] Stay with us, Matt! -[groans] My name's also Matt. Oh, my God.

[Influencer Matt] Do it. I [bleep] dare you. How do I feel that the other Matts don't know that I'm here? I... I think it's fine. -[yawns] -Does anyone respect me? Does... does anyone even know that I'm here? -[somber music playing] -It'll be a long, hard road. I'm done. I'm a good Matt. [sobs] I'm a really good Matt. I can't do it.

[upbeat retro music playing] -[inspiring music playing] -[wind howling] [German man] Art is isolation. -[snarls] -[German man] Art is obsession. [Yeti grunts] -[grunts] -[German man] Art is friends. -[intense music playing] -[bell dinging] [PA announcer] Attention. Passengers, -the train is now departing. -[train engine rumbling] [PA announcer] Please make sure all hands and legs are securely -inside the carriage. -[rail tracks rattling] [PA announcer] Thank you, and enjoy your day. [train whistle hissing] [intense music playing] -[detective] I wake up. -[train horn echoing] [detective] Another night on an endless track. [suspenseful music playing] [detective] Another walk down the same corridors in the same labyrinth with no end in sight. I check the pillow next to me. Cold. As usual. The loneliness blankets me like a shawl -that's too thin for the winter. -[wind howling] [detective] And it's always winter. -I pour myself a drink... -[slurps] ...and stare at the TV. [smacks lips] I fell asleep watching Friends again. Friends. The only light in the infinite darkness that is my life. The HD-DVD begs me to watch, "The One Where Chandler Takes A Bath." -[train horn blaring] -[detective] But I can't. -[ominous music playing] -[drink pouring] [detective] I'm so alone. [exhales] I'll always be this alone. The thought bangs around my skull like a lunatic in a padded cell. Ha, ha. Hee, hee. I'm crazy. [music turns dramatic] [detective] Sometimes I think what life might have been like -if I had chosen another career. -[ominous music playing] [detective] Or been a likable person. But that's the past. That's all academic now. And I never went to college. [indistinct chatter over TV] [gulps] I only wish I had someone to talk to. Sure, I have Friends, but I wish I had friends. -Um. -I want my own Joey. I want my own Monica. I want my Ross and Rachel moment. [glass shattering] [detective] I take a drink and steel myself for what I'm about to do. This is my last chance for happiness. [suspenseful music playing] [detective] This is my last chance to develop social skills. My one, final shot at not being so alone. I've been running from people like phytoplankton from a whale’s mouth, because, let's be honest, people are the worst. Selfish, arrogant, untrustworthy. They always let me down. Like an escalator that just keeps going, going. Down into nothing. [voice echoes] Which is what I feel. Nothing. I think I might be losing my mind. -[bell dinging] -[PA announcer] Next stop. Straight jacket and a padded cell. [detective] Yeah, no. I am definitely losing my mind. And I can't have that. I have to be sane. I need to be sane. I'm doing something that goes against everything I've ever stood for, everything I've ever been. I'm opening up my door... and letting people inside. -I'm throwing a dinner party. -[dramatic music playing] [detective] First things first. -The guest list. -[ominous music playing] [detective] So many faces. So many names. So many real, different people I know that definitely exist. [train engine rumbling] [detective] It's enough to make my head spin... like riding a roller coaster -with too many loop-de-loops. -[roller coaster rattling] [detective] And I'm not tall enough to ride. -[train engine rumbling] -[railway tracks rattling] [train horn blaring] [detective] I decide to start the way I always do. -Diving in. Headfirst. -[dramatic music playing] -[detective] Christina. -[indistinct chatter] [detective] Cute little number. A little stuck up, and can be a little too loud, but she's got her charms. This party could use a little life. She's in. Bill. Straight-shooting Bill. -Bill is a guy I like. -[indistinct chatter] [detective] Bill. I just like saying his name. He's definitely invited. Bill. -Teresa. Generally unlikable... -[indistinct chatter] ...reeks like a fish market in Taipei, but she goes to everything. She's great at filling space. [indistinct chatter] -[detective] Patrick. -[spits] [detective] Nah. I could skip Patrick. [glass shattering] [detective] Which leads us to Kelsey. Kelsey's the linchpin of this whole operation. Without her, the whole thing could come tumbling down. But wait a second. She doesn't get along with Bill, and I gotta have Bill. You know what? They're adults. They can be civil for two hours while we have a nice dinner. Ross and Rachel did it when they broke up. [music continues] [glass shattering] [detective] Yeah. I'm liking the look of this. Maybe I'm not a used-up old bag of dust. Or maybe I am. Now onto dinner. Thousands of ingredients, thousands of combinations. [railway tracks rattling] [detective] My head is swimming in a sea of confusion. And I didn't bring my floaties. [groans] I start to sweat and I get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. Something's wrong. [breathes heavily] Something isn't right. This choo-choo's picking up speed. [railway tracks rattling] [detective] It's about to jump the rails. [music intensifies] [heartbeat increasing] [detective] I reach for the emergency brake. -[railway tracks screeching] -[heartbeat decreasing] -[gulps, sighs] -[gentle music playing] [dramatic music playing] [detective] Then it hits me. Recipes exist. I could just cook something that someone else has figured out how to make. [blows] People love recipes. Why didn't I think of it sooner? Maybe things are starting to look up for me. Maybe my luck's gonna change. Maybe. [voice echoes] Maybe. Maybe it's because I'm anxious about the party, or maybe it's because I stayed up too late watching Friends, but I can't make sense of anything. [intense music playing] [detective] The letters seem to dance and wiggle their way from each other like cockroaches scuttering away from light. This is all too much for me. I can't read the recipe, and then it hits me like the dog I hit on my way home last night. [dog whimpering] [detective] I can't read at all. The loneliness smacks into me like a tsunami hitting Fukushima, causing nuclear meltdowns of sorrow across the country that is my heart. -[somber music playing] -[detective] It's pointless. Futile. Nothing means anything at all. I'm lost... [lights slam on] [detective] ...and found. [uplifting music playing] [detective] Why didn't I think of it before? I know how to cook, and I know how to cook well. Hell, I'm a goddamned master chef, as long as it's frozen, covered in plastic, and a Stouffer's TV dinner. Just when I thought I booked a one-way ticket on the Lonely Train to Isolation Town, I catch the Rainbow Line right back to Happy Friend Land. -[woman vocalizing] -[ethereal music playing] [detective] That's it. I get off at Macaroni and Beef station, -and the grab the next train. -[PA system chimes] [PA announcer] Non-stop service... [beeps] [PA announcer] ...to Flavorville. [detective] Maybe this time, things will be different. Maybe this time, things will actually work out. My head clears and I feel a warmth in my stomach. Things are starting to make sense again. [sighs] I celebrate with an episode of Friends. [Joey over TV] If I'm going to the movie, and you're going to the movie, why don't we just go together? [audience laughing over TV] [Joey over TV] Huh, how's that for data reconfiguration? -Huh, champ? -[audience laughing over TV] [ominous music playing] [detective] Now to the final piece -of the puzzle. -[PA system chimes] [PA announcer] Last stop. The aesthetics. [detective] This place is gonna look like the Taj Mahal on Christmas. And I'm fuckin' Santé Claus. Presentation is key. I want it to be upscale, but not too elegant, so the guests don't feel underdressed. It should look like Mecca on All Saints Day, but not Buckingham Palace on the Fifth Night of Diwali. Everything needs to be in its perfect place. The napkins need to be just right. Everybody loves pretty flowers. Wine glasses and water glasses. Cheers, mate. Yeah, no, yeah. That could work. That's pretty good. Candles, for ambiance and aroma. And last but not least, the pièce de résistance. Chairs. The best piece of furniture for sitting. [PA system chimes] -[exhales] -[PA announcer] The train is approaching the final station. [detective] And then it hits me like a fart in a tiny elevator. -I don't have enough chairs. -[intense music playing] [detective] I don't think I have enough chairs! Everything could be perfect but if you don't have a place to sit, then the party's ruined. Wait a... wait a minute, maybe someone could just kneel, or squat near their place setting. No, stupid! They'll look so stupid! I'm ruined. Undone by chairs. If I had a sense of humor, I'd be laughing, but I don't, -so I'm crying. -[train engine rumbling] [detective] The world starts to fade away and all I can see is chairs. [echoing] Chairs. Chairs everywhere. Chairs. Chairs everywhere. Chairs are the bane of my existence. Chairs. Am I a chair? What's a chair? Chairs! I don't have enough chairs! What am I? I don't have enough chairs! Chairs. Chairs. [PA announcer] All passengers... -[detective] Chairs. -...must now exit the station. [detective] Chairs. Have you seen my chairs, Mommy? -[chaotic chatter] -[detective] Chairs. Chairs. Chairs. Ch-ch-ch-ch-chairs! Could I have any more chairs? Chairs everywhere. Chairs that don't exist. [train bell dinging] [detective] Chairs I don't have. Party's over. No one's coming. No one's ever coming. Despair's setting in. -The world's getting dark. -[somber music playing] [detective] I guess this is it. I guess this is how it ends. [music fading] -[doorbell ringing] -[uplifting music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[detective] It can't be. They actually came! There are people here to see me! Who cares about chairs? The chairs don't matter. None of it matters. What matters is the people. What makes a party is the people. And there's some people just outside my door. Finally, some love. Finally, some affection. Finally, some friends. I'm finally going to have some fr-- -[music stops] -[traffic rumbling] [birds chirping] [train engine rumbling] [detective] Oh, yeah. That's right. [dramatic music playing] [detective] It all comes smashing into me like a runaway freight train. The memories, they're uncompromising, merciless. They flatten me with their horrifying reality. I've never had any friends. The only friends I've ever had is loneliness, despair, self-hatred. -But wait a second. -[music stops] [detective] I do have Friends. -[audience laughing] -"The chef's mahi-mahi -was awful-awful," is bad press? -[audience laughing] I didn't write it. [instrumental cover of "I'll Be There For You" playing] [eerie music playing] [German man] Art is fear. -Art is loss. -[woman sobs] [baby cries, snarls] -[German man] Art is pain. -[dramatic music playing] -[sharp piano notes echo] -[paint splatters] -[upbeat music playing] -Welcome to Numbnutz! The hidden camera prank show where the joke's on you! Today we’ll be playing, "Mother, May I?" The game where you gotta convince a random stranger -to be your mother. -[baby laughing] [all] "Numbnutz!" -[gun cocking] -[gunshot] [all laugh] Yeah, this guy here, he doesn't have a mother. No, he doesn't know his mom. Yeah, yeah. She died in a drunk driving accident. I'm never gonna hear -the end of it. -[car crashing] -Really funny guys. -All right, all right. -Get some new material. -I gotta take a shit. [whimsical music playing] [Laird] What do you guys think? -These three here? -[Wingman] Oh, yeah. -Go to those three. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Laird] Yeah, these three here. They're gonna get it. Sit down with them. Right... right next 'em. -[chuckles] -[Numbnutz crew exclaiming] -[Buzz] Look at that. -Mommy? [all exclaim in surprise, laugh] [Laird] Mommy. Look at Laird go. -Look at him go. -Momma. -[Laird] Momma. Mom... Mommy. -I don't understand. -Mommy. -What is this? Oh, oh. That's brilliant! [Veronica] Are you looking for your mom? -Uh. Mommy, Mommy. -He's not gonna cross... -I don't know, I don't know! -...the finish line. Mommy, Mommy, Momma. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. -[Buzz] No, they walked away. -[laughs] -[Wingman] Laird couldn't do it. -[buzzer blares] -You failed big time, buddy! -Oh. [laughs] -Hey, Laird. -Uh. Yeah, yeah. Laird, you were good, but I'm gonna do better! [Buzz] What do you think, boys? Is he gonna do it? [Lapdog] Nah, he doesn't got the guts. -Oh! It's adorable! -I know. People think you can't walk cats but you totally can. [Buzz] Yeah, right here. These two right here. These two. Hey, they'll never know what hit 'em! -So funny. -[in kids voice] Hey, Momma? -[Numbnutz crew chuckling] -Are you talking to us? -Hey, Momma. -Classic. Can I go outside and play, Momma? -What is your problem? Stop. -We are outside. Momma! I did all my social studies homework... -Leave us alone. Stop! -...Momma! Now, this is classic -"Mother, May I?" -[both laugh] -Momma, come on, Momma! -Whoa... -Momma... -Stop. ...let me go outside and play-- [screams] -[all scream, exclaim] -[Wingman screams] [rock music playing] -[screams] -That's what you get you-- [indistinct clamoring] Your own mother doesn't even love you! It hurts so bad. It fuckin' burns! Seems like every time he does something he ends up getting pepper sprayed like that. [screams] At least he has a mother! [all] Oh! Somebody give me some water or some fucking milk, or something. [Buzz] He looks like he's in real pain. Pour some milk in my eyes. Where are you guys? [Laird] Hey, guys. No one should help him. Where are you, guys? [Lapdog] You're on your own, Wingman. You little baby boy. [Buzz] Yeah, why don't you cry to your mommy now, huh? Cry to your little mommy. -[imitates baby crying] -[baby crying] [Lapdog] Zero! There's a goose egg. -[upbeat music playing] -Mommy? -[sobs] Mommy? -Oh! The crybaby approach. Oh, I've seen this back in 2004. -Mommy! -[Wingman chuckling] [Lapdog] Not gonna work. Not gonna work. [Buzz] Will you be my mommy? -[sobs] -[Numbnutz crew laughing] [Laird] Oh, here comes a lady. Here comes a lady. -Hey, there. -[Buzz sobs] -She's stopping! -Stopping! -[Buzz] Will you be my mommy? -[Numbnutz crew laughing] [Lapdog] She's actually doing it! [Laird] Oh, she's giving him a hug! [Lapdog] She's givin'-- [Wingman] She's givin' him a hug! -[sobs] -I'll be your mommy. [all laugh] -[Buzz sobs] -I will be the best mommy. [Wingman] Hey, this is the first time -a lady touched Buzz. -I really love you, Mommy. I am gonna love you a lot. [Laird] Well, hey, it looks like -Buzz took this one, huh? -[rock music playing] That lady wanted to do more than be his mother. [all] Oh! -They're talking about sex. -[female voice moaning] Hang on a second though, guys, because we still got one to go. -And we know who that is. -Ding, ding, ding! [Wingman] Let's see what Lapdog can do. [Buzz] Let's see what he can do. [Laird] Oh, is she reading a book? -[laughs] -Who reads anymore? I... I know this is gonna sound weird, but I think you're my mother. -[all chuckle] -What did you just say to me? Oh, she doesn't like it. She doesn't like it. [indistinct chatter] -Mom... Mommy. Mommy. -Oh, look at Lapdog go. -Oh! -Just nasty. Baby needs his bottle, Mommy. Come on. -Oh! Baby. -Give me a little taste, Mommy. Yeah, give me a little taste.

Somebody call -the fucking doctor. -I want my mom! -Oh, my God! No, no, no. -I want my mom! All right, just gonna put it back in here. -I want my mom! -Put it back! Oh, fuck! -Fuck! Somebody!

[both] Numbnutz! -[gun cocking] -[gunshot] -[techno music playing] -[choral grunting] -[German man] Art is struggle. -[warriors grunting] [German man] Art is conflict. [warrior screaming] -[German man] Art is war. -[warrior groans] [suspenseful music playing] A time of war. [war drums beating] It has been fifty years since the death of the shogun. In the ensuing chaos, the ruthless Okabe clan seized the throne. All were swept away in the tide of their ruinous will. But now whispers on the wind carry the sound of hope... ...to those that would listen... -[war drums slow down] -[ominous music playing] [water burbling] -[music continues] -[wind howling softly] [music builds] -[breathes heavily] -[music fades] [Okabe speaking Japanese] Kuranaga Shizuka. [grunts] The Girl Who Crawled From Fire! You have finally come. So I have. [Okabe] You have defeated my armies... vanquished my navies... eradicated my cavalry... and burned my fortresses to the ground. [insects buzzing] [Okabe] You even bested my personal guards, the Silent Wind. They were the most skilled swordsmen in the entire realm. Less skilled than me, it seems. [Okabe scoffs] Very good. You exceed my expectations. So... Kuranaga Shizuka, Destroyer of the Okabe Clan... What happens now? -[breathes heavily] -[dramatic music plays] Now I kill you, and avenge the husband you hanged... the son you drowned, and the daughter you burned alive! -[music intensifies] -[water splashes] [fire roars, crackles] [Kuranaga] And also... for my neighbor Kyle! -[imitates gunshots] -[blows] [music stops] Oh... Kyle! [laughs] [continues laughing] [music resumes, builds] -[sword slashing] -[music concludes] [Okabe] Kyle was a great neighbor and it was a shame I had to kill him. Nonetheless... if you intend to kill me, I intend to defend myself. You think so little of me. -[katana whooshes] -[tense music playing] You have defeated all the best swordsmen in the realm. Except one. And he stands before you. Enough talk. [music intensifies] [katanas clanking] [Okabe and Kuranaga exchanging blows] -[Kuranaga grunts repeatedly] -[Okabe groans repeatedly] -[grunts] -[Okabe groans] [birds chirping] -[Kuranaga grunts] -[Okabe groans] [whimpers] -[grunts] -[Okabe groans] [grunts, groans] [pants, groans] -[Kuranaga grunts] -[groans] -[pants] -[suspenseful music playing] -[Kuranaga grunts] -[groans] -[whimpers] -[Kuranaga grunts] [music turns ominous] [grunts] -[music crescendos, fades] -[Okabe groans] -[groaning echoes] -[somber music playing] [Kuranaga] Do you hear that, Okabe? that humming in your ears? those are the voices of the dead. -They lend me their power... -[punches landing repeatedly] [Kuranaga] ...to erase your balls from existence! -[grunts] -[Okabe groans] -[music concludes] -[Okabe screams, whimpers] [groans] My... My... My... [breathes heavily] My... balls. [tense music playing] [loud war drumbeat] -[crowd cheering] -[upbeat music playing] [German man, in English] Art has no rules. -[crowd exclaim, cheers] -[head groans] Hmm?

It's always high in calorie and low in flavor. Does your organic ketchup leave you broke at the bank? My accounts have run dry. And you, are you sick of eating ketchup that's pumped full of GMOs and chemicals that are known to cause cancer? [Chab] He's right. I do have cancer. -[upbeat music plays] -Well, say no more!
