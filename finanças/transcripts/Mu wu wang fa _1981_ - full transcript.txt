Leave me alone But on hearing the news his brothers have come for a petition Damn, I am busy They said it's inconvenient in the day time Looks like they have brought gifts Wei Wu Bring the prisoner Sun Long has killed an official and is inexcusable but considering it was self defense he'll be imprisoned for 3 months Thank you, your honour Brother He Don't be like this Leave me alone Keep calm Keep calm Our job is to get rid of outlaws But they are doing quite the contrary I'll fight them to the end Brother He, Ying Hao's death is a result of Chief Liu's treachery He's on to us the whole time how could we prevail? So are you saying we should give up? How could we face Ying Hao? Speak... If we fought to the end would you be with me? The officials have great power let's be wise and preserve our lives What? Have you forgotten how the three of us swore to protect each other? Have you forgotten our ideals for being a constable? Yes, but ideals and reality are two different things In this lawless society justice is a sham Justice always prevails; It's just that some people are cowards making justice a sham I am not afraid of death If I could get rid of evil and crimes I'd do it Ying Hao's kind of death was for nothing and would only produce widows and orphans was it worth anything? Madam Let me go...

Where are you off to? Back to my hometown, to raise my kid and live a simple life Why be so pessimistic? I am a woman In this macho world how would I survive without a husband? Besides, this society thrives on power, not reason I want to leave here and leave the painful memories behind I made some clothes for your kid Do take them Take care Thank you... I'm going, you should be at peace Taking up a good cause for the people, my husband died who could give him back to me! It's not your fault why blame yourself If it weren't for me why would he die? Why don't you give up being a constable Hey, let's both quit & return to our hometown together I want to be an upright official so everyone would know that righteous officials still exist What difference would it make? All the same they'd end up as victims of evil ministers You need say no more I have made up my mind Won't work unless our lot mixes in with the bad guys What are you saying? As they say: 'Birds of a feather flock together' If not, you'd be the next A hero is upright he could lose his life, but not his honour I'll not give in You risk your life to catch criminals yet a murderer is only imprisoned for 3 months how are you going to fight against them?

Shut up Hard to believe I can't handle him Brother He, watch it you'll suffer for it if you go against them We all die sooner or later It's up to fate to decide when but we must die a glorious death and we should charter our destiny Brother He, agreed you can go against the robbers but could you go against the officials? Haven't you heard of 'survival of the fittest'? You of all people talk to me about that? You are a man why be afraid of them? I am not afraid I also had my ideals but is it worth dying in this world without justice? Besides, I have my family I...need to go on living If you are so afraid of those corrupt officials why be a constable in the first place? I just wanted a job and provide for my family Provide for family, survival of the fittest From now onwards we'll go separate ways Brother He I won't be weak like you, shying away As long as I live, I won't bow to evil Brother He...

Yes Fifth master said not to give him anything to eat Okay Move Go inside Speak up Thank you You... How could you fight against the officials? Why didn't you listen to me? In this corrupt society justice can't be gotten with mere principles Well, I still have faith that justice will prevail If that were true you wouldn't be here now Ying Hao wouldn't have died for nothing Luo Zhang would not have sold himself out Don't mention that bastard Did you know he was coerced? I said don't mention him What would you do if you were the one who were held hostage by that bastard? I'd rather die than be a dog Do you think the problem will be solved just by dying? You are too selfish; ever thought about what would happen to me if you died? You'd better stay away from here as far as possible Find someone and remarry Thirty years I don't know if I'd live that long enough Don't worry, I'll redress an injustice for you Redress?

Do you know that this is a crime that warrants death? He doesn't deserve to be our government official The one I am holding right now is a criminal who protects prostitution, gambling, and corruption He's talking nonsense Shut up Tell me how you've been wronged and I'll be the judge I was originally a constable in this province Since I was against the crime of this magistrate he set me up and put me in prison and killed my wife It doesn't matter if I have to die, but I do hope that you uphold justice and prove me innocent Your Honour, he's making scurrilous attacks upon others I have always been honest and abide by the law Nonsense. Haven't you sent Chief Liu to come and offer me bribes? Your Honour, I... Shut up. When I was canvassing the people I have already heard that you're corrupt putting lives of the innocent in danger Here's the witness, don't you dare deny Bring the sword Yes Spare me, Your Honour; I know I've been wrong, spare me You've been corrupt, your wrongs cannot be forgiven Be lenient, Your Honour.
