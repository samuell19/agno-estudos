Set the sight all over. - Here's the most recent imaging. - It's like they were aiming for us. - We've confirmed sightings just outside Boston. Delta One has just lost signal. - We have Delta Two on sight at the crash in Ambridge. It's about to transmit, sir-- Guys, you hear me? - One spring. This is Delta Two, we are on site. Meadows, Meadows are you there? - Vasquez, I'm here, is that you? Copy that. There's a lot of debris around here. - Be careful. Copy that, sir. The signal on the monitor shows that the descent was correct, it's directly ahead. Proceeding with caution. Meadows, we can't seem to get through. There's something approaching. Fitz, Fitz. There's smoke all around us, Meadows. - What's going on, Delta Two? Meadows, Meadows, there's simply the smoke. The deceased... Oh my god, run. Run goddammit, run. Delta Two, can you see what it is? No, run. Kill 'em slow. We'll be down below us. It's an-- - Meadows, Meadows. - Vasquez. Delta Two. - Please don't. Tonight. Please don't push. I just, I don't. I don't need it tonight. - What do you want me to say, CJ? You want me to say yes, sir, like you're my fucking father? No. That's not that what I asked you. Right. - You-- You don't want me to say fuck when I'm having a conversation? - That's not what I said either. - When I'm angry? - Are we in the same room. - Right, okay. - Are we talking-- - How 'bout I just shut up? - The same people? - All of my emotions. - Also not what I asked-- - So that you-- - You to do. - Can ignore yours. - No. What I'm asking you to do is very simple. Okay, all right. - All I'm asking to you to do is just leave it be tonight so that I can have a night with my friends. Well, we know that I can't have a rational conversation according to you. - Not right now, apparently. - Right, okay. Okay, fuck off, CJ. - What? - God. I'm so sick of you critiquing everything that I say. - Critiquing what? - Everything. We can't ever just have a conversation. Is what I'm saying. - What the hell do you think? How the hell do you think I feel about coming home every day. - Okay, here it is. - After 15 hours at a desk-- - I know. - That I hate. - That's your choice. That's not mine, CJ. - Yeah. Working with a boss who hates himself. - I know, you're miserable. Coming back to this, and then you treat me like a fucking piece of shit. - Why don't you just leave? - Leave? Just leave, CJ, if you are-- - So that's your answer. That miserable, yeah, just leave. - That's your constructive advice for our current situation is just leave, just run away? Which is apparently what you're good at. Yeah, okay. - It might be the only thing. Fuck. - All right, now he's cursing. Fucking impossible. - You promised to love me. - I didn't break a promise. I've never broken a promise to you. - I can feel you don't anymore, CJ. - I can't help what you feel. - And I fucking-- - I can't-- - Hate you for that. - All you can trust me but I-- - Fucking hate you. - Can't help what you feel. - I can't do this anymore. - This, what is this? - This. - What is this? - CJ, this whole thing. I can't. - Are you asking? Are you asking for what I think you're asking for? Yeah? You just want me to leave. You just want to throw everything away. Everything we've worked for. - You did this to us, CJ. - Years. You want someone to blame. You want someone to blame, okay, fine. I'll pack my shit tonight. - Good. - I'll leave tonight. That's what you want. - Mm hm. - All right. - Fuck. Hey, what are you doing out so late? Okay, bye. - It's actually really funny that you asked about that because with everything we've been going through and all the packing. - Hey. - Hi! Yeah. - Hi. - CJ, how are you? - It's good, how are you? - Good. Good to see you. - How's it going, man? - Hey, Danny, it's been a while, man. - Yeah. - Been busy. - Monica. - How are you? - Hey. - Hi, CJ. - How you doing, man? - Doing well. How 'bout yourself? - Long day. - You look beautiful. - I brought you a bottle of something. - You guys didn't have to do, you do know we're not dying, right? It's a easy 90 minute flight by plane. - Right, right. - This is true. - When we can afford plane tickets, and time away, we'll be up there. - Yeah, we have the jet set money, you stud. - It's Boston, guys, so if you think about it, when you break it all down. I think I'm making less money, but it's still a promotion, so that's something, right? Okay, well then think of this as your last good bottle of red forever. - Switch to the cheap stuff, you know, that Mad Dog. - Right. - Do you need a drink? - Right. - Yes, I think we need to go drink. - I'm going with them. - Yeah, go. Well, if it's as good as you say it is, no one minds, I'm going to pop this fucker open. - I insist. - Please. - Actually if you do not mind waiting, we have one open already for dinner, so if we save it for after dinner, since it's gonna be good. - Party pooper. - Party... Party pooper. - What's going on here? - Well, we don't know. We just started watching it. Some gas leak or something near Hanover. - Gas leak? - I don't know. It's been on for the last hour. It looks bad but they've been saying that they're gonna contain it, so. - That's good, 'cause that's not a quality you want in gas. - No. - An industrial level. - Right. - If they can-- - No. - Can I just put my keys on here? - Oh, yeah, throw 'em anywhere. Doesn't matter. - I would love that, thank you. - Here you go. - Hey, babe. I'm just gonna show CJ the thing. - Oh, yeah, that's fine, that's fine. It has been this weird sway of emotions all week. One minute we're fine, and the next, I am bawling my eyes out because I'm packing up the mug you gave me in the fourth grade. - I can imagine. - I can't. - Hey, Danny. - Oh. - It's works. - I'm sorry. - Okay. - What, I thought you stood it already. - I want to tell you in person. I'm pregnant. - Soph. My good, you put that down, come here. My god. - Thanks. - Amazing. The timing is perfect. - Oh, I know, it'll give me time to get settled, get things together, get a room together. I mean, Eric wasn't keen about the whole idea, but that is our deal, so. - Oh, wait deal like knock me up and I'll move to Boston, that deal? - Yes. - What? I think it's this 1950s mentality they have going on. You sacrificed enough for him. - Look, I just think that you're pissed because I get to be a mom and no one will put a baby in you. - Danny would, right? Danny? - I will, eventually. - Well, I am just glad you guys are here. The people we give a shit about. Eric's coworkers threw this party for him at work, and I am so glad to be leaving half of those people, I swear. - That's what happens when you're the trophy wife. Well, I have been to enough of those parties. It is just nice to have five minutes for food and wine, even if I can't drink it and-- We'll drink it for you. Oh my gosh, I'm not thinking about Boston. The realtor up there is actually a bit of a dick. I mean, Nina, you all right? - I'm sorry, Soph, I know tonight's your night. - What happened? - I just, I can't get excited. Did you guys have another fight? - We're getting a divorce. What? - Jesus Christ. - Wait, wait-- - Nina, I'm so sorry. - Did he said he wanted it? - He said he's moving out tomorrow, so, yeah. Pretty sure that he wants it. That fucking asshole. Stop it. - You have put up with so much, Nina. I swear, you have to get half his stuff. The car. - Okay. - The house, you gotta look out for yourself. - I will, thank you, I will. - You know what, Boston is a 90 minute flight. And once we get settled, if you wanna come up for a while, you know you can. - You should do that. - I'm not, you just moved out there, I'm not gonna do that to you. - I can deal with Eric. - Yeah, besides, it'd be good for you and Sophie. - It's true. Besides, I need somebody to hang out with while he's at work, I mean, we can go shopping, and we can get the house together and-- - Okay. Okay, I will think about it. - I need you. - I'll think about it. - Okay. - Just don't try to think about it tonight, okay? - Yes, don't let it ruin everything, and I know that this is easier said than done, but this is our last night here for a while, and I want you to enjoy it, okay? - Okay. - So you're gonna sit by me at dinner and tomorrow, we are going to figure all this out. - Okay. - And we're here for you. - I know. - Absolutely. - No. - Here for you. - We can hug now. - Wait, wait, wait, I love you guys, too. Danny? - It's gonna be okay. You want in on this? Come on. - I'm good. Come on. - Okay. You guys are huggers. - Oh, what, goddammit, Eric. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break up the little lesbian powwow, and Danny, I do include you in on that. - What do you want, babe? - I was wondering if you could pop the merlot. Let it breathe before dinner. - Absolutely. After all, that's what I'm here for, right? - All right, it's okay, we'll take care of it. We got it, all right. Don't worry about it. - Here, I'll get it. Let me grab this one. - Yeah. We're going. - All right, let's go. - She told me to leave. - Just like that, she wants you out. - Just like that. - That's tough. Do you wanna stay here tonight? - No, no it's okay. I'm moving out anyway, so I should probably-- - Right. - Start figuring things out. It's just... It's just been brewing for a while. - Yeah. - You know. - Yeah. You tried, so... Well, what can you do? - It doesn't feel that way. - Well, you know, you just take it one step at a time and it's a mountain, you know, you gotta climb that mountain, so you put one foot in front of the other, you take the steps, you'll get to the top. You'll feel better. It sucks, dude, I know, and I'm sorry that I have to go deal with Sophie right now while you're dealing with this all by yourself. I hate that, I don't wanna do that to you, but you know... - Thanks, man. You really put things in perspective. I just really want you and Sophie to be happy. - Yeah, that remains to be seen, but you know what dude? Fuck all that other shit. I got you, too, okay? I got your back, any time, just not right now, though, not in this exact moment because of Sophinator, but another point in time, tonight definitely, we'll recycle back. Hey, guys, dinner's ready. - Awesome. - Great. - Great. - Yep. - So let's go make our way to that, we're coming. - Thanks for doing all this, Soph, this bread looks great. - Absolutely. - Oh, hey. - This looks amazing. - It look good? All right, everybody sit down and remember, let's agree, no talking about work. - Seconded, absolutely. - Yes. - Wait, guys, guy. - Jesus Christ. - Does the move count as work? - Goddammit. - I'm just asking, I'm sorry. - Wine anybody? - I'm just asking. - No, I'm good, I'm good. The attic and the sink, but we're gonna save that for the end, so... - Yeah. Everything has to be perfect and clean for the realtor. - Of course, of course. - Do you guys need help? You have so much to do. - No, we're fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, no. - We don't mind. - Be happy to pitch in. - Yeah. - Plus I got this big, strong man here to help me anyways. - Right, strong man. - Oh, sure. - Hey, he's stronger than he looks. I'll be around, is all I'm saying, you know. - All right, okay, let's just get this over with. Decided to put us neck deep in it in the first 20 seconds. - I was just-- - Gonna give a speech. Are you kidding me, man? - Simmer down, you'll know it. State of the union over here. - All right, relax. - Come on. Let him say it. - Lend me your ears. So here's to Eric and Sophie, all right. We know you're only a two hour flight away in Boston and some of us will wish it was farther. - Hey, what? - Yeah. - Here's a treat, seriously, though, guys. We love you guys. - Yes. And we're gonna miss you. From all the bullshitting we've done around this table to the late night parties, that last till four AM. - I have the pictures. - Can't remember half of it. Rather not. - Let's not go there. To the nights spent smoking cigars on your porch, we love you guys so much, and we're gonna miss you a lot. Yeah. But rest easy knowing that once Sophie finally gets to Boston, she finally gets to be a mom. Thank you so much, that was a great-- - Wait a second, hold on-- - Richard. - Hold on, whoa, whoa. - What? - Let's back it up, I'm missing something, what happened? - You haven't told him yet? No, I forgot to mention it. - Is that right? - You forgot? - I'm sorry. - It's only a baby. I mean, why not. Eric put a baby in me. Oh my god, wow. Holy shit. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - That was great. - Thank you. - I'm very happy for you. Did not think that was possible. Like, at all. - Right, right? I'm not the only one. - No, but goddammit, congratulations. - Thank you. - That's amazing. - Yeah. - It's good. Exciting. - Yeah. Here's to Eric and him being a daddy, cheers. - Cheers. Cheers to Sophie being a mom. And all of us being aunts and uncles. - Finally. - Can't forget about us. Right? - Finally. - Yeah. - Little who moment, if I've ever heard one. - Wow. - Really? - Someone doesn't sound very happy. Sound like an obligation, Eric. - It's not an oblig... No, guys, it's fine. - Right. - I'm happy. - You know. Is that your happy voice? - I'm happy. It's good, it's good. Look, it's all apart of the plan. It's all apart of the plan. I get my promotion, Sophie gets her baby, we get a family. It's all happening, the American dream, mommies, daddies, aunts, uncles, one, two. That's what I'm saying. - Cheers, everybody. - To romance. - And to love. - All of it, and we are gonna miss all of you guys. - We're gonna miss you. - I mean it. - Me too. - Well, most of you. - Yeah, I see how this is. Lovely speech, okay. - You dish it out but you can't take it. - Well, you know, it really started to hit us today. - Like what, like how? - We were taking down pictures with photo albums, I mean... - That must be hard. - Well, you know, sometimes, you just have to pack up and move on. - Yeah. - Things run their course. - Kind of like you guys, right, right? Guys, I'm sorry. - It's fine, it was bound to come out. - I didn't mean to say it. - It's okay. It's all right. - Guys, things happen, let's just... - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's just have fun tonight. - Let's just try to enjoy our night. Can you pass the dip? - Yeah. - Actually. - Here. - Thank you. - Mm hmm. - It's actually really good. I'd like to talk about this. - CJ, I'm sorry I'm started-- I'd like to talk about this. No. - Come on, let it go. No, I'd like to talk about it. - Are you sure? - Yep. I know everybody at this table has a certain perception of me based on something they think I did or didn't do. It's true, it's fine, it's really fine. But it's so important for me that you know that I didn't do anything. I did not do what you think I did. Does anyone at this table believe me? Okay. All right. - Well, hey, CJ I believe you. - It's all right, Dan. - Stop. - Don't worry about it. - Don't. - Don't worry about it. Look, guys, this is not the best time to do this. - No, I think this is a great time. - Yeah, so Nina-- - This is a great time. - Come on. - No, it's a great time. - Let's not do it right now. - It's a great time. It will be like couple's therapy. Right, CJ, remember how you never wanted to do that? - Okay. You really don't have to do this. - So... - CJ, come on. It's fine. - I would love to start off with a question. - Shoot. - Okay, why after an entire year can you not come clean? - About what? - Okay, CJ I saw the texts. - Okay, from who? - The missed calls from, you still? Who calls at 11 o'clock at night, CJ? - People in my life who know me. - And then hangs up when your wife answers. Because I have a life independent of you. - Right, okay, you still talk to her. - Why are you answering my phone? Of course I talk to her, I work with her. - If you had any respect for me, for our relationship. - Hold on, stop, stop. - Then you would-- - Stop. - Never talk to her again. - What do you mean I would never talk to her again? We work together? - Stop raising your voice. - We saw you, Sophie and I saw you. - Saw what? - We saw you in your office when everybody else had gone home. - Working? - Who does that? Working. - People who work. - Right, okay. - Yes. People who work stay late sometimes just stop. - Did you fuck her? Did you fuck her on your desk? Were you too cheap to buy a hotel room? Hold on, shut up. - So you fucked her on your desk. Hold on, shut up. - Or maybe you didn't want-- - You're being a fucking awful piece of fucking shit. I can't keep my cock in my pants 30 seconds after I leave the house. - Is that even a question anymore? - I have no impulse control. Let me ask you a question. - Yeah. Ask away. - Let me ask you a motherfucking question. - I would love to answer, I would love to answer. - Would I have been such an awful fucking monster? - Absolutely. If I had saw any degree of affection-- - Right oh. Outside of our goddamn nightmare hell scape of a fucking home. - You want affection? I can't even look at you. - Anything. - I can't even look at you. - A fucking kind word. Are you kidding me? - Without being disgusted by you. - Fine, fuck you, fucking crucify me if you want. - Walk away, you always do. - Hey, hey. Nina, that's enough. - Oh, fuck off, Danny. - All right, sit down. - Leave her alone. Danny stop. - Okay, thanks Danny. - Chill the fuck out. - Thanks. - You know what? - CJ, hey, CJ. - Are you okay, Nina? - Can you believe him? - I'm fine. Yeah, thank you. - Bitch. - You never should have done this. - Man, that was... That was... Hey, man, do you wanna stay here tonight? We will not mind the company. - No. - Are you sure? - It's okay. - Yeah. I'm moving out anyways so I should find a hotel. - Oh yeah, I thought you were too cheap for a hotel. - Fuck you. - Go fuck yourself, man. - No, I'm sorry for ruining tonight, and I don't know how things just got out of hand. - It's okay, man. - Holy shit, you guys heard that, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, we all did. - We did. - That scared the shit out of me. - Hey, did you guys hear that? - Yeah. - Yes. It sounded like a woman. - Did you see someone? No, no. - Did you see someone? - No, we were just standing around talking, so... Okay. I'm gonna go out there. - I'm going with him. - Wait, guys, I don't think this is a good idea. - Look, guys, this isn't the best time to go playing heroes. - We're not playing hero. What if someone's seriously hurt out there? - Well, then let someone else call the cops. - Are you kidding, what if it takes too long for them to get there? Look, we're just gonna go out and make sure everything's okay. - Well, you have to stay here, and make sure that everything stays okay. - CJ and I are gonna go, it'll take two seconds, and Danny will be here. - Yeah, yeah, I got it. Hurry back, okay? I'll be with CJ, it'll be okay. - They said they'd be right back. It's been five minutes, we haven't heard jack shit. - You know what, it's okay, I'm going out there. - What are you talking about, Soph, no. - I didn't say you had to go, did you? That doesn't mean it's a good idea. - I know, but look, it has been what, five minutes? We haven't heard anything. No noise, no sound, anything, don't you think that's weird? - Yes, I think that's weird. That's why I'm not going out there. - I think we should call the police. - And tell them what? It's been five minutes. - Gonna tell them that something is wrong out there, something is going on. You heard a scream and you don't know-- - Oh my god, you guys, it was probably the morgues fucking really loudly again. - Hey, don't dismiss me like that. Something is happening. Look, I'm not okay, I just-- Something is happening. - Monica, we're just not all as sensitive as you are. - Really, Nina? - I'm concerned. - Don't start, Nina, now-- - Fuck off, Danny. Nina, no, you fuck off. Danny. - Okay, you ever stop to realize that maybe Sophie wants to see her husband again? - What'd you say to me? - I was pretty clear. Drop the act. - Danny-- - Okay, no, this has been a long time coming. CJ's out there trying to be a good Samaritan, and here you could give two shits about him. - Okay, then what are you doing here, you fucking boy scout? - I'm trying to take care of the people that I care about. - Right, fuck you, Danny. - What is that? - Sirens? - Are those air raid sirens? - What the hell is an air raid siren? - Goddammit, Mon, read a book. - Oh. - What the fuck? Who is that? - Fuck. - Shit. Shit. - Help me, man, someone, Danny grab the first aid kit. Close the door! - What was that, what was that? What the fuck? What was that? The fuck, what the fuck was that? You, you, what the hell did you bring to my door, you son of a bitch. - Sophie, stop. - What did you say, you can't-- - Back off, back off, it's a cop. What, what the fuck is a cop doing here? Okay, okay, Jesus. - Listen to me. - Just calm down. Grab some towels. - Towels, okay. - Hey, were you shot anywhere else? - It's okay. - What's your name? - Riley. - Were you shot anywhere else? - No. - Are you hurt? - Just there. - How bad is it? Oh my god. - Okay, so this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna put pressure here, and I want you to keep it there and do not move at any circumstance, okay? Otherwise you're gonna bleed out and we're gonna call an ambulance, call someone now-- - No, no, don't. - Fuck, no. No what? - No ambulance. - You need medical attention, you're gonna bleed out. - They won't make it through all that. - What? - Won't make it through what? What's out there? What is that? - More people like that. Just get away from the windows. - What are you talking about? What did you see out there? The war. - What does that mean? - Hey. What? - No, no, don't. - CJ, CJ, don't. Pennsylvania crimes co-seals, you must leave. If you do not disperse, you made be arrested and or subject to public police action. - Sounds like a goddamned riot out there. Fuck. - Oh my god. - Gosh! Oh Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. - Oh my god. - What the fuck was that? - Pittsburgh Metro got a call. There was an explosion or something. They figured it was just a gas leak, so they sent a few officers. - What was it, was it bomb? - That's what they thought when they got there, but then they realized what really happened. It was some sort of chemical attack. - Was it terrorists? - Honestly, I don't know. - Oh my god. - The first responders, they called for backup in riot gear. Then they were torn to pieces. - Where are the other officers? Your team, where are they, what happened? You guys get separated? - My partner, I lost him in the smoke. I couldn't see a damn thing out there. My mask is the only reason I'm even here. The smoke, it... Made everyone go crazy. They were like goddamn animals. I'm not sure if anyone's left. The hit the whole city. They hit the whole damn city. Danny, keep pressure on that and Monica, turn on that TV. - Okay. - Oh shit. - Okay, guys, what the fuck? What do we do, do we call the police, the fire department? - I don't know, did anybody hear anything about this earlier. - No. - How do we even know he is who he says he is? - What? - The fuck are you talking about? - He could be a fake cop or something. - He's a cop who's bleeding out on your floor. The fuck, what the hell are you talking about? - I don't know. Playing up on the gas leak, trying to rob us, kill us, there's sick people out there. - No, people don't do that. - All right, do you want me to go ask him for some ID while he's got a whole in his stomach? - Anybody can buy a badge and a costume and say, "I'm a fucking cop." - He looks pretty fucking official. - We don't have time for this. - Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm throwing something out there. - We don't have time for this. - Okay, just give us a break all right and use your brain. You guys, you guys, get over here. - What is it? - Listen, listen to this, listen. Presence here. Again, if you are just joining us, we are seeing pictures from downtown Pittsburgh. There's been a massive explosion, and a chemical component of some sort has been released into the air. So far we've had 72 casualties reported in just the last 30 minutes alone. Now, we're here, just off close to the tower, but the police are telling us we cannot move in any further until all the gas has been cleared from the area. We are also hearing rumors that Pennsylvania National Guard maybe called in within the next hour. Keep in mind, David, we are hearing this news on the back of reports that the same sort of incident has occurred in both Philadelphia and New York and although we have not had official confirmation from government officials, we are fairly certain these are coordinated, biological-- - I can't listen to this shit, that's ridiculous. - Is this real? - Calm down, it's okay. - Is this really happening? - It's okay. - I wanna go home. - No, you can't. No one can. Look, we all heard what that thing said. No one leaves this house, you hear me? What the hell? Oh, fuck. Go on, honey, go on. - Okay. - What is going on? - You can't see. - Okay, I got a flashlight. - It's okay. - Somewhere. Let's just calm down. - Fuck. - God. What is happening? - Lantern, okay good. - Yep, we got it. - Good. Looks, it's all right, guys. It was probably just a breaker or something. Bullshit, Eric, didn't you just hear the TV? It's whatever's going on downtown. We're eight miles from downtown. Look, maybe it's somebody else acting crazy but let's not jump to conclusions. - Oh, great, conclusions? - Yeah. - People are dying downtown. - I know that. - What do you want me to think, asshole? Jesus Christ, calm down. - Calm down, I don't want to calm down. What I want is to go home. I never even fucking wanted to come here in the first place. - Well, she gets points for honesty. - Wow, okay, well, let's, you know what, let's figure out what the fuck we have to do. - Is it on the news yet? - Is that the thing you were talking about? - I saw it. I saw it. People tearing each other apart. - Well, it's okay, you're safe with us. - Am I? - Get down. - What the fuck was that? I don't know. Okay, hold on. - What? - Hold on. - Eric. - Eric. - Eric, don't. Do not open that door. Are you kidding? - Hey, hey, are you with the police? We're here to help, sir. - Are you with the police? Is everyone okay? - No, we're not okay. We have an injured Pittsburgh metro police officer in here, he's bleeding pretty badly. Guys, the police are here. Monica, help's here. He's right over here. Are you okay? - Besides this hole in my fucking stomach. - Oh my god. - Ma'am you need to back up. - What the hell is going on? - Back the fuck up. - What is going on? - Okay. - You need to back off. Back up before I ventilate you. - Jesus Christ. - Okay, all right. Stay here, there's a major gas line explosion. Look, there's more important things going on in your neighborhood that we need to assess. Stay here, lock the door. We'll send a team down to retrieve you guys in about 45 minutes. - 45 minutes? - He's bleeding out. - Are you fucking kidding me? - He doesn't have 45 minutes. - Do you understand? - Yes. We understand. Until then, shut the door. Lock it and don't answer it for anybody other than military. Do you copy that? 45 minutes, my ass. - Fuck. Fuck. - If it's a gas leak, then why is the military here? - Hey. - Hey, Soph. - How you doing? - I'm really sorry about that. I don't know why I said those things. I didn't mean it. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. I just feel like I'm losing control, you know? - Mon, it's okay. - I just wanna get out of here. - I know, me too, all right. - Look, I promise I won't be a bitch anymore. - Well, let's not make promises we can't keep. Actually, we're gonna go down to the basement. Try to see if there's anything down there we can protect ourselves with, anything. Why don't you come with us? - Okay. All right, let's go. - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything. - Me too. Just don't, CJ. It's not worth it. - Hey, we're going downstairs. We're gonna try to find something to defend ourselves with, you know? - Yeah, okay. - All right. - It's actually an older radio. My dad used to keep in the basement in case of emergencies. Getting anything? - He's trying. - Echo seven, this is Riley on an emergency frequency. Do you copy, over? Echo seven, this is Riley on an emergency frequency. Do you copy, over? Riley, come back. This is tango six one, come back. - Harrigan, is that you? Copy that. Good to hear your voice, Riley. - Where are you, over? We got pinned down just outside of homestead. There's no one else, Riley. I'm holed up just off of 837. A family took in me, Von and Chappy. Downtown core is shut down. It's just not downtown anymore. It's everywhere. You need to stay inside. It's only gonna get worse from here on out, you hear me? Protect yourself. You can't-- Protect yourself. Be safe. - Harrigan, Harrigan, are you there? - What the hell are we doing down here? - I just told you. We are trying to find something to protect ourselves with. - What, like a broom or cobwebs? - I don't know, Monica. I am trying, okay? - Sorry, I'm sorry, Soph, here. Thanks. - Hey. - What, what? Can you give me those containers? - Those? - Yeah. Do you see 'em? - Yeah, yeah. - This is gonna work. - Here, here. - Look, if we mix the bleach and the ammonia, we can use it. - Use it as what? - That's your idea. - If you mix them in the same container, it becomes toxic. Then you can spray it in the eyes of whatever those things are if they come at you, and it gives us a chance. - Okay. - All right. - Just to buy-- - Day is it, Sophie. - What are you saying, Nina? - Seriously? What do you need? - I don't wanna die. - What are you saying? - We'll fucking die in this fucking basement. - Nobody is gonna die. Nobody is gonna die, here, Nina. - Guys, I don't feel very good. - CJ? CJ is up there trying to find a way to get us out of here, get you out of here. - No, he's not. - Because he loves you. Yeah, I heard it. - Someone's here. - Go get Eric, now. Nina, I got this. - No, Soph, I'm staying down here with you. - All right. Here. - All right. No. No, no. Fuck. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Oh, fuck. - You know this guy? - No. No, I don't. - There's no reason you would. - Hey, asshole, you broke into my house, so technically, I got it, I could kill you and I'd be within my rights, isn't that right, Officer Riley? - It feels right. - Sounds good to me. - Who are you? - Fuck off. - Fuck yourself. You're not a guest here, who are you? - Shane. Dr. Emmet Shane. - How the fuck did you get in my basement? - Your side door, your side door was unlocked. - So what, you were just hiding? Hiding from what? What's out there? - Yes. - Where do you work? I said where do you work? - I work at Nexor Labs. - Are you responsible for all this? - Me, personally? - Okay. You snarky son of a bitch, you think you can attack me. - No, wait, Nina, Nina. - I will fucking kill you. - Nina. - I will kill you. - Stop, Nina, stop. - This is not healthy. - Nina, stop. Calm down. Okay? Calm down, it's gonna be okay. - That's what they want to happen. They want us to tear each other apart. - Who? Who, goddammit? - You want the official statement or you want the truth? We've been toying around with this for a while. Chemical warfare can only go so far. Gas masks can protect you. But what if we could have made a nerve agent that could be absorbed through the skin or through the ears or by some other means. That's what wins wars. Changes countries. That's what they gave us. They cut a single, so we sent a probe up, in friendship. They sent back meteors. Impact was about 15 hours ago, and that's when it started. Starts with a tingle in the base of the spine and it slowly moves up to the center of your brain where all your hate and aggression lie. It jump starts that. Removes all the inhibitors, and all that hate comes spilling out in glorious fashion. It really is a thing of destructive beauty. Before we knew it, there were impacts in other cities. DC, Boston, New York. By the time it's all sorted out, all those cities will be gone, wiped out by man's own aggression. Whatever it is up there, they don't like us very much. This is it. An extinction level event. This is how the world ends. - What do we do? - You're looking at me, why are you asking me? - What? Yes. I am asking you. I am fucking asking you because you have the answers. You have the solution. You can fix it, remember? You always fix it, so how are we gonna fix it, Eric? - We go to the basement, we barricade ourselves in, and we don't leave until this is over. - Fucking wait it out and then what? Then what are we gonna do? That shit's gonna seep in here and kill all of us, all of us. - So we try. - No, hey. - We try this time. You don't get to take this from me. - CJ, you need to calm down. You need to calm down, now. - Do you know what? Fuck you guys. - You know what, who the fuck cares, anyways? Fuck. This is my house. - Okay, Danny, you and Monica, just go upstairs and make sure the windows are closed, and make sure Eric double checks the attic. - All right. - I got you. - Let's go. - Come on. - Sophie, come here, it's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - Danny. Danny. Danny. - You okay? - Danny, I don't. Something's wrong. - Hey, look at me, look at me. Come on. - I can see downtown from here, hold on. - What? - Do you see that? See what? - The glow. - Hang on. Here, look, look. Please don't tell me that's what I think it is. - I think it's headed here. - What do we do? - I found this in Sophie and Eric's cabinet. And I would hate to see it get wasted in the move. It's good shit. - It was our first date. That's when I knew. It didn't take six months or a year, I just knew right then. And we've hurt each other a lot since then. And I know I'm not always the easiest person to deal with. - You're fucking impossible. It's okay. - I know. - I'm not easy either. I really still give a shit. That's why I'm here. - I know. - That's why I'm here. - I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's all right. I'm sorry, too. - I'm sorry. And I know I said do whatever the fuck you want, but I don't mean that. You don't get to do whatever the fuck you want this time. - I like it when you're demanding. - I'm scared, CJ. - What is it? - Wait, wait. Don't move. - It's just a matter of time before they make it in. - Either that or the gas is gonna leak in through the vents. Eventually it'll find a way to seep in. - Can we just go somewhere and get more equipment? - Where the fuck are we gonna go? - If you can move, can we make a run for the cars? - And go where? - I don't know. - Try that radio thing again, get the emergency line up. - Okay, okay, hold on. Echo seven, this is Riley in an emergency frequency. Do you copy, over? Echo seven, this is Riley-- Echo seven, this is tango six one. It's getting worse out here. We just got word DC and Philly have both been hit. It already started there. Now, New York's gonna fall within the hour. This is it. The winds are shifting down. It's pushing all this shit over the top of you. Copy? Riley, are you safe? - Copy that. We're running short on time here and we have no supplies. We have seven survivors with us. Is there any way out, over? I know, I know there's a police substation just off of Center Avenue. If you can make it there, there should be more supplies. I can't guarantee that, but it might be your best option. If you stay where you are, you are sitting ducks. I repeat, you are fucked. - We're starting to get that feeling, over. Where's Center Ave from here? - It's about three miles that way, but we'd have to go through town and we only have one mask. - Then only one of us can go. - That means one of us is gonna have to get to the car, get in, supply up, get back here, and then we get clear of the city. - Harrigan, we're going for that substation, and then we're coming for you. Once we get back with the supplies, I'll radio you and get your location. Echo seven out. Copy that, watch your ass, Riley. - I never liked Philly much anyway. - Okay, all right. We gotta figure out what we're doing next. What's the plan? - Okay, just wait a second. What exactly are we dealing with? The minute this touches our skin do we-- - It slowly absorbs through the pores of the skin. - Okay, so we just, we have to cover up, we have to get barriers. - Sophie, do you have any extra clothes that aren't packed? Like gloves? - Most of it's in the van, but you know what, I saw some things downstairs. - Okay. - I'll go check-- - Yeah, go check. - And see if I can find them. All right? - Yeah. So who goes? - I'll go. - What, Danny, no. - No, I'm the fastest in this group anyways. Fuck you trying to say? - I think I said it all, man. All right, fuck you. - Here, you're gonna need it. - Hey, guys, come here. Did you find anything, Soph? - Yeah, a few things. Here can you grab those, thank you. All right, found some jackets. It's pretty much what's down there. If you need me to keep looking, I can. - This'll work, this is perfect. - All right, awesome. Has anyone seen Eric? His tool kit's over there but I haven't seen him. He must have finished covering up the vents, right? - Last I saw him, he was up in the attic. - All right, I'm gonna go check on him, then, okay? - Okay, I'll go with you. - No. I got this. I think he's probably just pissed off, all right. - Okay. - I got this. Sorry 'bout that, guys. Wait. What's that? - Doesn't sound like a helicopter. - Whatever it is, it sounds pretty low. Can you see anything? - That's a lot of people. - They must be drawn to the sound. - Dan, are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Sophie. - Sophie? - Guys. - Be careful. - Shut the fuck up, guys. She's finally quiet. Fucking crying with the baby, the fucking baby. Crying, I couldn't take it. What the fuck is this? I can't-- - What happened? - Sophie's dead. What? - There's no time. Eric didn't close the vents, it's in the house. It's in the house. - Oh my god. - It's in the house. - Oh my god. We have to go. - Don't fucking move. - What is that? What is my head on fire? - Go. What are we supposed to do now? What do we do? - We stay alive as long as we can, and make for the police station. - How? We only have one mask. - Then we rotate. Fuck. - They're coming in. - No, no, they aren't. I'm buying you guys time. - Danny, no. - You need to go. All right, get covered and get out. - Danny. - I said go before it's too late. - Okay, I know Sophie looked. We were here earlier. Here. Jackets, CJ, here, put 'em on. Put 'em on. We'll just wear these sweaters now, okay? We can wrap 'em around you and I'll wear them, and we'll be okay. No, CJ. - It's not working. - CJ. CJ, please, just put them on. CJ, please, don't make me do this by myself. Okay, please? CJ, CJ, CJ, I can't do this by myself. Okay, so please put these on. Okay, look at me, CJ? Okay. I don't wanna do this alone. So just put 'em on and we're gonna be okay. - So tired. - Okay? I know. I know, I know, but it's gonna be okay. You're gonna put these on, and I'm gonna wear them and it's gonna be okay. Okay? Okay? - Let's go. Let's go, it's time. - There's plenty of layers downstairs. I'm gonna grab some, we can put some jackets on you. - I want you to put this on. - Stop, CJ, we have so many layers. - I need you to put this on. - CJ, stop. - I need you to put this on. - You can put some layers on. I don't-- - Nina. - I'm not going by myself. - Nina. - CJ, I don't wanna go by myself. - Nina. - We can-- - I need you to listen. - Find a way for you to come with me. - No. - Yes. - There isn't another way. - You can-- - There is no other way. If you go alone, you have a chance. If you go alone, you have a chance. You're gonna have to and you can. You can. I know you can. I love you. - You too. - I love you so much. - Okay. - Go. Okay, yes. Okay, yes. Thank you so much. Hello. - Please someone copy. Please. I'm a survivor. I'm going to the police station. Please. Anyone. Fuck. Fire and police, this is rescue three. Repeat, this is rescue three. Are you affected by the toxin? - No. No. Are you alone? - Yes. Yes. Yes. Please, somebody come and get me, please. Where are you? - I'm at the plain police station, please, somebody. Just sit tight, ma'am. The first wave has past. Have you seen them yet? Have you seen them yet? - No. What's your name? - Nina. My name is Nina. Nina, we're on our way, sit tight. We are coming to get you. Just for 15, 20 minutes, the rescue is coming. Stop. Okay. - Nina. Where are you? Always running away, fucking runaway. Only think you're good at. You're not fucking good at keeping a man. Fuck. Fuck. Nina, I wanna go home. I'm fucking burning up, I just wanna fucking go home. I just wanna go home. I can't go home. I can't go home. Until I killed my mother fucking runaway, where are you? Nina. Nina. You know what I really fucking hated towards the end? The nasty little fucking pussy between your legs. Why would I fucking come home to that, disgusting fucking bullshit, why would I put a fucking baby in that? Why would I fucking give you a baby so I could rip it out of your nasty fucking pussy. Oh my god, you stupid little fucking cunt. Maybe I should have fucked her. Maybe I should have fucked her, you ugly fucking saggy tit piece of shit. No. I'm gonna kill you. I never fucking loved you. And killing you is gonna feel almost as good as fucking her. Almost as good as fucking her. I fucked her. I fucked her. - I hate you, I hate you. I hate you. Denial for survivors. Hey, I think I found one. Ma'am, are you okay?
