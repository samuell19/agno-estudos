He is “Inumu” He basically is a thief. Wherever he sees iron would cut it and sells in Kgs. The only film he saw for most of the times is “Iron man”. The only song he likes is There is no relation to him with this story, but he can be seen anywhere going ahead and can turn the story. Hey Giri Yes brother, tell me Time has come for us to write some pages in the history of crime. Is it required to lose life for the pages bro? Leave me bro, I will go. Bloody waste fellow! Is it to leave now that we worked for the whole night? What to understand bro? I never did such a big risk in life. I will leave bro. Will you leave even if I say to give this bag to your brother in law? Bro, do not go for such a big thing. Whatever may happen, I will be here. It is all God’s grace now. Tell me son in law -You remember what and how to do, right? I will follow the plan as it as once the girl comes out. Why is so much mess and Police here? Bro, may be our matter is out We got to risk, though it is out. What if by chance that girl does not come out? -Then we will go in and kidnap her. Bro, that is more dangerous. You do not take such decisions. We will wait for five minutes more. For my sake, please bro. Hey, that girl is coming. Get ready. Bro, there is even the gun man. It would become a big risk. Listen to me at least now. Security means there would be the gun man and not a post man. I would say only one thing to you both, target should not miss. He won't listen to anyone. (Oh God, save me) Hey Srinu, go on. Ok.. Are you done breakfast. You bloody. It's burning.. Why did you put chilly powder on me?? Who are you?? Anybody please come Don't do that, Listen to me Nooo... Hey, move faster Hey, move faster Hey, Start the vehicle soon.. Ya ya i'm on it. - Make it soon, Move - ya ya i'm trying. Idiot, drive looking in the front. Thank God, I expected not to fall out alive. Oh no, It is biting dude. Give it once, I will kiss that cutie. Srisri said not to look cheap at a puppy, match stick or a piece of soap. Similarly, do not look cheap at me for stealing a puppy. He is number one in Vizag. Do you why, he being so had to steal a puppy? It seems you called me I need the list of all vagabonds from Vizag. How much time would that take? Sir, I have a doubt. Any CI coming new would ask for the list of thieves, murderers and goons. But why are you asking so sir? The one wandering without any work is more dangerous than that wandering with avenge in this society. If revenge spoils only him, the one without any work would spoil ten people around him Crime rate would automatically come down if such fellows are controlled. Raja, where would these be at this time? Police.. Police, who always come after everything is over would come in the middle when we are drinking dude. How about our drink now dude? Expecting such problems, I have set a guy to supply drink even at the middle of the night. Super uncle... Son-in law, Take this. there will be a number of Nani working as a bearer in bar. If you call him and inform our address, he would do road delivery similar to door delivery. Hey Nani, we urgently need drink, write the order. We need 3 full Whiskey, fish fry for my munching. Give your order dudes. Hey our special dish, quail fry Hey, how much more time dude? -If I hit on your face Hey bloody rascal, how much more time? If you are not here in the next five minutes, we will not look for any other munching in drink, but would eat you up. Make it soon Be cool Dude. What cool ? This watch is from germany, Is it working?? Hey, looks like Nani fellow has come - Finally he's here What is that, Nani is coming with a stick instead of covers? Hey dude, he looks like your father. What is he doing here at this time? Give the phone. Son in law, you ruined me. It was not Nani you called, but my father. Is it? Has it happened so? Sorry dude, I could not differentiate Nani and father in the drink. See you tomorrow. Hey dude, hey! Bloody, do you call your father and ask to bring the drink? Have you brought dad? Yes, I brought it. - Don't beat me dad it is a great thing to start an NGO on the name of “Spandana” and get the poor kids operated to the hearts, Surya sir. This is all the inspiration given by you. We could collect 35 crores till date with the help of good people like you. We are doing all arrangements for the operations on the childrens day collecting 15 crores more and we need your help for that sir. Here uncle, I am contributing by even cancelling my matinee movie. Spend it carefully. I'm tired of this daily donations. Who is this boy sir? It seems I need to do some good work for introducing me as his son, In fact, whatever I do from the time I get up in the morning are those. For example, yesterday -Calling me in the night and scolding Who is that bloody? Oh no, uncle is it you? When did you come? Come and sit uncle. Mom, uncle has come, bring coffee. Enough of your over action dear. Sir, your son called me yesterday night, and asked to bring quail fry for munching along with drink. Daddy, you are saying the order wrongly. It was me who ordered quail fry and son in law is ordered fish fry. A clarity again in this ow would they change sir? hey say those as sons who put father out of hell, but what can these showing hell to father while alive be said. I think a good son What a command on language son in law? Dear, do not mistake me for saying like this. Do you know how many has your father helped? Similarly Please do not pull me into this service uncle. Is it how you speak with the elders? What if not mom? I do not even know how to pay the power bill in E seva, what I can I do social service? What bro? -Yes bro Are you Raja and Srinu? CI sir has asked to bring you. Hey, do you know why have I called you here? Tell fast sir, it is getting late for office. Yes sir, it is become a habit to go punctual to office, even if we do not brush. Bloody, do not say stories. Your entire life stories are in this file. When we did a survey of all the vagabonds of Vizag, yours is the first name and second was yours. We can felicitate the guy who did the survey sir, it is perfect. Hey, see and learn from him. See how tensed is he as his name is in the list. I am not feeling for that sir. Why are you tensed then? If at all it comes, I should be the number one from the waste fellows in the city, but how can he be? I am feeling for that sir. What is your greatness dude? I did Engineering for 6 years and you were out just for five years. I can have four beers bottoms up, can you drink? I was caught four times in drunk and drive and you were caught only twice. Ok, you were caught. We too will be caught from today. What will you be caught? Shut up idiots. Have you got any Nobel Prize to scold each other? Bloody, you are roaming so free, why do you not go for some job? Why will we not do sir, when someone gives? Hey, I have already informed to a friend of mine in Hyderabad. You have got a job in his software company. 30,000 salary per month. Thirty thousand? Many thanks sir. We are unable to bear the scoldings at home. We cannot forget your help in lifetime sir. I have a doubt. For what are you doing all this? We are seeing many kids dying with heart problems having no money for operation. Surya sir has founded this Spandana trust for avoiding that from now. Let us sound our heartbeat through this Spandana and give life to those kids. Your father was my senior in College. We learnt from his sincerity and simplicity. I do not like his son to be so. Give this cheque to your father. Go and do the job sincerely. We will enjoy for three days and climb the Hyderabad bus. Hello, if I see you tomorrow in Vizag I myself will encounter you. Today night is your journey. Wow, great Still, why does my dad say to serve easily like taking a selfie? Oh no! We are leaving to Hyderabad as all these would not be there, right son in law? Do you remember 30, 000 salary. We can swim daily in drink. Ok dude, do you know how to swim? If it is drink I will jump even if I do not know swimming. Bloody, look for another bus. Why dude, bus is fine right? I would travel with an idiot like you but never with a dog. Look for another bus. Still, what is your problem with dogs? That is a tragic story. I enjoy listening to stories while traveling. Tell if there is a good story son in law. Please, please. Ok, I will tell. When God changed the lives of all, a Dog has changed my life. How? Look there Those were the days of my 5th class. Those also were the days mischief was budding in me. Whatever mischief I do, used to give a build up as good boy at home. All used to believe. Dad who always brought something along while coming home, has that day brought an injured dog home. Naming it as Viswas, he put food for it in the plate. After giving it that name, it started making me get caught. Bloody idiot, do you steal? Please, do not hit me. Hey Yes hubby Are eggs at home? No hubby Here, there are many in your son’s progress report. Use them. Bloody idiot, zeroes in all the subjects. It’s work is to bark and your work is to study. It is doing its work correctly, but you? At least see to it and learn, take. This is my elder son. What about him? My waste son. Either that dog or me should be in the house. Mom..mom Please open the door I could not withstand that day dude. Next day, on the name of walking I took the dog and left it in the borders of the village Knowing that, do you know how many areas had my dad got searched for that dog? Thus, I hate a dog. Son in law, when I asked you to say a story for enjoying the journey, do you say it like I get a fever? Hyderabad is come, get down. Son in law, looks like our life would take a turning point. good turn or bad turn? Good turn if you are in control. Excuse me sir, will you buy the dictionary? Dictionary? What is that? Oh, you do not know its meaning, right sir. You can search that in this. Hey, keep searching that aside and you first search for another job. Why sir, will you do my job? Bloody, why do I need to do such a job? My salary is 30, 000. Do you cheat me? I will not leave you, tell the account. Wow, who is this like Aadhar card for beauty? Uncle, you do not stop. RR is great, continue as it is. Is selling dictionaries too a job? I would have died hanging, if I was in your place. Hey son in law! Ok for me, but my son in law hates such jobs a lot. What dude? Will you buy a dictionary sir? Hey son in law, what are you doing? Excuse me Will you buy? What? Dictionary No please, thank you Oh no, looks like time has come for life to take a bad turn. Hey son in law, it is time for office, Let us go, come Hey, go man Hey, I am calling you Are you following me? What do you want? Dictionary I said no, right? Please What is this selling dictionaries cheaply son in law? It does not look good going late to office on the first day itself. Move. Uncle, look how cute is that girl.

When a batch over acted on road, I hit them badly with this dictionary. Ammu, I do not know whether time is changed or not. I am looking for your matches, stay calmly at home. They wanted to see me as heir in politics after him. But I have not heard. I am now understanding how important money, status and power are. So, my son in law should minimum be an MLA. Remember this. Sir, now you leave it to me. I will take care of it. Let's go... Before someone love and cheats you, marry the guy dad sees. You would be happy. Hello, the guy to cheat me has still not born. Aunty, you are cheated. There are no pages of “O” words in this dictionary. Leaving out the AC rooms there at office, why are you selling dictionaries here like a waste fellow dude?

O, E, L, V,I,U I fear all my dictionaries would become tissue papers in his shop, by the time she understands that you proposed her. You do not worry sir. I have a strong confidence that the girl has good brain along with beauty and courage. As per my calculation, she should have understood by now. Dude, she understood. I need to speak in piracy with that girl, you leave. Hey, I am telling with the experience of selling hundreds of dictionaries, it is privacy and not piracy. Both are done secretly, not much a difference. Whose idea is this? It's me.. I expected such a bloody brain would be you. Thank you. Hello, I am not praising to feel shy. I hate those playing such cheap tricks. I thought it a printing mistake when letters missed, but I now understood that it happened because of your character mistake.

You should put 75, 000 in my hands. 75, 000? Pay and take! This is actually our dog sir. I do not know all that. I will not give the dog to you, even if a rupee is less from 75, 000. If you still make a mess here, remember that SI too is our customer. What is the position there now? It is her birthday in 3 days. She planned a lot, but you ruined everything. Son in law, when I begged falling in feet, he promised not to sell that for the next two days. We urgently need money now. Who would give us dude? 75, 000? You sold just one dictionary after you joined the job. That too 10 dictionaries loss for that dictionaries. When I am worried here thinking how to recover that loss, you want 75,000 again?

Sir, this is not any movie for all these dictionaries to be sold by the time song finishes. Move dude, let us earn with these dictionaries. How dude? Dear girls, your position in this country is very bad. You have no safety in any state. You should safeguard yourselves. Do you want to know what to do for that? You should buy these dictionaries. Poor guy, son in law is not knowing what to do in the frustration. This will not just be useful to see meanings, but will also be useful as a weapon. What is he saying??

Do you know the reason for breaking the heads of these two? This dictionary and that too a girl has hit. Do you know the reason behind breaking hands of these two? Same dictionary and again the same girl. Do you know the reason for everything to be broken for him? Dictionary Correct Here is the 75,000 you asked for. Thank you sir.

As marriage would stop if those fall in the eyes of my brother in law, I brought them here and am burning bro Please give that bag, I will burn it. Give 75, 000 rupees first and then either you burn or bury it, your wish. What are you threatening me, what will you do if I do not give? Simple, I will distribute these love letters in your sister’s marriage. Please sir, do not go for that. I have no money even to pay the dowry to my brother in law. What would I give, my foot. Ask anything else other than money, I will help. Son in law, shall we sell this van? Thanks bro, you are one among those late fellows who said this as a van. Who would say it a van for its condition other than you? You will not get even 10, 000 by selling it, where would you keep that? What shall we do son in law Take out the vehicle first.. bloody! We shall think on the way. My life has become a taxi Sunakanadam pet shop, is the dog 75,000? Give me that 75, 000 and I will be behind you swinging the tail. Sir, you waited these many days. Just wait till evening and with the money Sir, where is the dog? Just before you came, a rich man and his daughter liked it, paid and took it. Do you know their address sir? They said some place in Banjara hills. Go man, I have a lots of work to do. I think they would be shocked to the surprise I give now. Come on bro, I will leave if you give my bag. Bloody, have I not said will not give the bag till I get the dog? it is found, right? Where? it is.. Here bro, If you take this dog and give it to sister it would be great. Will she not come running, catch you and give continuous kisses? Shall we sit in the vehicle once? Wow, I think a great felicitation liking my idea. No thanks. It is somewhat similar.

Sorry dear, it was a mistake. I love you Ammu. I love you too. Where are you now? In Kesava Reddy’s house. I am frightened, they are making arrangements here for the marriage. how many ever arrangements they make, your marriage will be done only with me. That is not so easy. That Kesava Reddy is a dangerous fellow. how much ever dangerous he is, I will hit him and take you. You do not be any tensed. Catch him I was in tension thinking where to search and how to kill him and how long would it take. You are greatly caught, idiot. He and his friends are the reason for my mother to be like this. Kill all of them and come home guys. - ok brother Take out the vehicle. Like a pupa changes to butterfly, every rowdy changes into a politician is what believed by Veerabhadramma. Her dream is to somehow see her son Kesava Reddy as an MLA. Do you know how was the fear born because of Raja that the dream would remain as a dream? Oh my, as me and Sridevi look alike they used to call me as Nellore Sridevi those days. Oh sister! I was always Sridevi from Vasantha Kokila film. Leave that mom, what are this matches all of a sudden? Hey Kesava, it is not enough just dreaming to become an MLA. You need to take every step cleverly. You should not even breathe without a use. That is politics. Tell a bit clear to understand mom. The girl you are going to marry is the granddaughter of Nellore ex-MLA Raghava Reddy. Affection on him in the public has still not come down. We have the notes but no votes. If you marry her, you would become MLA with a record majority. Then? - I will become a Minister. You are super, mom How is the girl, son? She is like the gift box packed with one lakh votes mom. What is the boy saying madam? He is asking when the marriage is. You know that my son is the would be MLA. Even the election date is nearing. We have not many traditions. If we agree with full heart, that is the engagement for us. If you say ok, it is ok from us too. If so, we will have the marriage in two days. So early means, what about the arrangements? You do not need any arrangements. Start immediately to Nellore. Marriage is at our house. What son? - Ok mom. What Subbu? Super sister. When we gave you the money as you are the trust President, it is wrong saying to use that now for elections madam. Operations would be stalled and kids would die now if that money is not there. Oh no, look Surya sir! Who are we to change the fate written by Lord Brahma? Still, population of the country would come down by stopping these operations. That too is a service to nation, right? Well said sister. I will not leave this matter. I will call for a press meet and inform the public how bad you are. I will send you to jail. Oh God! I do not know whether you can listen or not. Know one thing, if you can listen. I cannot bear anyone saying anything to my mom. Hey Kesava, I know how much you like me dear. But in politics, you can do backstabbing but not stabbing and shooting directly like this. Hey Subbu! Sister From now, it is your responsibility to take care that neither him nor any of our guys do any murders or other things. Understood? Yes sister. Look Commissioner Yes madam. He ran away with the trust money. Divert the case on the name of investigation till the election is over. Ok? Fine madam. Hey, call him first and arrange to bring 75 crores. He is calling mom. Tell me Bro, unexpected thing has happened. I expected milk man or paper boy early in the morning. But, I have not expected the IT people to come bro. They have taken all the amount bro. Bloody, drive looking in the front. Hey! Mom, mom! No, I am very much frightened about injection. I will cry. Nothing would happen madam, just bear a bit. What is this mom? You roaming with axes and swords fearing for an injection? Who are you bloody? Me mom, your son. My son? I am still in 6th class and not married yet. Where is Subramanyam? Subramanyam! Here is Subramanyam, mom. Have you recognised him? Hey, looks like mom recognised you. Yes bro. Subramanyam is not this fellow. My Subramanyam is a small puppy. This is a piglet. Subramanyam! I can understand now Watching Vasantha Kokila film repeatedly, she has become A mad Cuckoo. I will not leave those who made my mom go mad. Come on move to Nellore. He and his friends are the reason for my mom going mad.≈ Kill all of them and come home. You start the vehicle. Leave us bloody! I am in the tension of my girlfriend’s marriage and who are you all boss? One says a dog and the other says mom. Give some clarity before killing boss. Bloody, our sister is gone mad because of the accident made by you and your friends. That means, was the vehicle that went opposite in the morning was of them? Brother in law! Tell bloody What if they know that you were the driver?- No! why is she being mad because of us? Why have you come to Nellore? My girlfriend Ammu boss, I came to take her back with me. is what believed by Veerabhadramma. Ammu!...Ammu? Hey, take this money and that girl and live happily going away somewhere. If you are seen in these surroundings from tomorrow… Brother What? What is your name bro? Why? To name my son after you in future. Subramanyam, they call me Subbu with love. Thank you Subbu. Ok bro. Come on guys. Bloody mad rascal Sir, good morning sir. That Spandana trust Surya fellow has run away taking all the money. I feel hand of that school teacher Rammurthy too is in that scam. No sir, he is a very good man and very sincere sir. Look, Government is giving you salary to catch the culprits, but not to give conduct certificates for them. Understood? Bring him first and interrogate. Ok sir. Where were you all this time dude? I was observing from the van son in law? What, how they kill me? Where is that fellow? What is this get up dude? Kesava Reddy would kill me if he knows that I was the driver and thus I changed my get up. Am I not looking handsome? Leave it. Hey, these crows.. Let us first go to the address given by Ammu,move. Come brother, come. Where do we search for them in Nellore sir? He said his girlfriend has marriage with someone, right? Yes So, we shall search not just the marriage halls but all the houses having marriages in Nellore. I came to know that you are marrying the granddaughter of Raghavaiah. Public would surely vote for you. It is a waste now for my brother even to go for nomination. What if marriage does not take place, it is a waste for you to file nomination boss. Nobody can stop this marriage. That means the guy who just wanted to kill me and now marrying Ammu, is one and the same. Why is he become rigid like the statue on tank bund? Hey Giri!- Stop son in law, I will call him. Brother in law! You will have it if you call me so, bloody get out. You pushed me into the houses with dogs till now and now into the house with lions I cannot, I am leaving. Hey bloody, that is Photoshop. We have to believe some looking at the cut outs. Why did he run away like that dude? Anybody should run away spending some time with you. What is the plan now? You will be ready starting the vehicle and I would go in kicking the gate. I will kick one on that Kesava Reddy and bring that girl with me. I will get married in Vizag and this is the plan. When I am an example for friendship, you are the example for selfishness bloody. You forgot about me in the whole plan, shall I beg here when you go and marry in Vizag? Ok, do not feel. Plan change! You will be ready starting the vehicle and I would go in kicking the gate. I will kick one on that Kesava Reddy and bring that girl with me. I will make that Giri agree for marriage and we both will get married in Vizag. How is this plan? Now, you too are the example for friendship along with me, son in law. Plan is great, start now. Come on go. Ok - Go. All this is the greatness of my mother. She is made me with no one to come in competition. Yes bro Where is Subramanyam? Subramanyam! But she is finally become like this. Yes bro! Have you killed him or not? No bro Bloody, being so many what is this not doing him anything? Bro, Bro Bro! Has sister not said to do anything till elections are over? It seems that fellow has come to run away with a girl named Ammu. He will never again be seen here bro. It is important that you become an MLA and that is the aim of even sister. If seen, he is dead in my hands. He always calls me in the wrong time, Will he cut my phone? Bloody, I will tell now. Bloody fellow, now at this time. Sir, tell me. Where have you been bloody? That Raja is cutting my phone. We are at the house of Nellore Kesava Reddy. What are you doing there, bloody? Sir, do not shout. Our guy is gone in and if caught would have a marriage. Marriage? Yes man, he is like that and getting married in my absence. That is not the marriage you are thinking sir. Whatever it is, but a marriage is a marriage. I am coming to Nellore, bye. is what believed by Veerabhadramma. Sir, sir Bloody fellow, never listens completely. Idiot..... Hey Ammu... How did you come? Nobody has seen you, right? None knows that I came other than you and that. Hey Subramanyam! Who is that? Wow, are you right here? Come dude, come let us play. Has she gone? Tell me once. What? I love you said before over phone. I just said in the phone, right? Only your words can be heard saying in the phone. Your expressions will not be seen, right? No expression you are expecting would come now in my tension. Only we both are here, come on tell. There is still 10 minutes time for the bus to start, Let me have a full meal by then. Looks like the marriage of some orphans. Who’s relative are you? The bride I am from the groom’s side. Hey, what is on the top? Bloody, will you not put food in the marriage? Who is there? Thank God, we can start if the curry comes in now. Curry…. Why has this bloody fellow come even here? There he is sir. Are you a human or a devil? Will you not let me eat in peace? I have not still had sweet, Wada or even put the curry. Will you kill me so fast, bloody? Where is Hyderabad and where is Nellore? So much bloody chase for that idiotic dog? You have 100 Kg of fat but not even one gram of brain. You mad idiot. Bloody, who is mad? I do not want the dog, but the 75 crore worth diamond in its belt. 75 crores? 75 crores? What are you saying bro, what is that diamond and the story? What is he thinking sir? Promise!- Promise, bloody! As you said to give 20 persent share in that diamond, I will show you where that dog is. Ok? Yes, high five! Ok, high five! It is been so long since she is gone in, why is she not coming? Subrahmanyam! Will you leave Silky or not? I will not leave my Subramanyam. Oh bloody! Subramanyam! Silky! It is sure, I would get caught to Kesava Reddy today. Is this trouble needed at this time? Come, let us go. It is needed.- Oh no! Give me. I will not give Madam, I do not know who you are. This dog is ours. Leave it madam please. Madam, I do not know who you are. This is not Silky, but my Subramanyam. Leave it. Oh God, she is killed me. Leave it. Silky Ammu! Decide whether I am important to you or that dog. You both are important to me. Leave it. Bloody life, is it the same importance for me and the dog? Leave it bloody. I will not leave. Silky! Subramanyam Stop! Both of you need the dog, right?- Yes Will you come with us? I will stay wherever my Subramanyam is there. Come, come. You move. What happened bloody, that British fellow is not lifting my phone. Hey, why has the power gone? Switch on the generator. Move on. Come on Ammu Who is she giving a wrong entry? Hey Srinu, start the vehicle. Come on start. This is the girl you loved right? Who is this lady? Mother of Kesava Reddy. Not mother, I am still in 6th class. This is my Subramanyam. Why did you bring her dude? I had to bring her. That is what, why? Hey, it is not any felicitation to remember repeatedly. It is an insult dude. There is our puppy. Hey start the vehicle Start the vehicle fast. Ok madam. It is become like a sharing auto. Why do you stop it, come on move it? I need money to become MLA. Ammu Ammu I do not know all that. Ammu I do not know. Son in law. Have you seen Ammu? Ammu? Who is Ammu? Oh, you do not know that. We call Amulya as Ammu at home. Oh no, is Ammu and Amulya the same? They call Amulya as Ammu at home? I am gone, my God. Bloody! I do not know anything bro. Why is this fellow come again son in law? Hey, throw out everything in the van first Ok Throw? Hey, what? Throwing out means not there, they should fall on their faces. Bloody, you do not even have the brains of at least that mad women. Sorry son in law, see now. Sir, she looks like Veerabhadramma, mother of Kesava Reddy. Oh, you too know that Kesava Reddy? We know him better than you, bloody move on. Hey, give it to me or else I will bite. Leave Hey leave. Leave it dude.- Oh no! I gave it great. You are super madam. Hey, catch the hands tightly, do not leave. Do not leave. who are you bloody? See, who is inside. Hey you bloody mad rascal. You should ask like this standing to a side on the road if you want a lift. You should not stand blocking the road like this. Bloody idiot! I too was saying that boss. You should ask like this for lift, but should not get the vehicle itself. I am the boss to Dhanalaxmi dance troupe in loss. God has shown a path to us at a time we were almost dying. But do you know how we came to know because of this rascal that the length of that way is 35 Km? My dearest artistes, you all know well how bad is the situations without programmes and money? From two months, no plate full food and peaceful sleep. Even if we wanted to live somehow, we do not know any other work than to dance. I thought of speaking for an hour putting a meeting, but am not able to in the hunger. Thus, I came to a decision. What is that? I sold of everything and bought two bottles. Wow Brandy! Boss, put even the other bottle, let us start. What is this boss, a foreign brand whisky? Not whisky, but poison. Oh no, we will die by drinking it boss We are to drink for dying itself. Oh, is it? Those having respect on my decision can mix both and drink. Those who does not have can drink Brandy and leave. We are born as artistes and let us die as artistes. Mix both and serve. I am ready boss I too am ready! Hey before drinking, let us pray that God to give us birth again as recording dance artistes. Yes dear god, give us birth so. Even then we will lose so and have poison again. Your head will be broken, do what is said. No, why is it happened so guys? Where did this stone come from? - No idea boss. Oh no, bloody! Hey, look someone has come. Hey Sankar, here is the advance to give programme in Kavali. Take the rest there. Why are you looking like that? Programme is tonight. Start immediately Hey Vijayasanti! Hey, super. This is not an ordinary stone guys, God has sent this as he does not want us to die. It is a messenger of God. Bring the van under mortgage. Let us go to Kavali. God, see to that we get no obstacles on the way. Similarly, the programme should become a big hit. Hey idiot, God has fallen down. Stop the vehicle. Ok bro! Hey God, forgive us. God has fallen down guys. Oh my God, where are you? Here guys, search here. Where is the God? Hey bloody, come on search. Hey go search, Brother i found. It's a normal stone, You idiot. Son in law, we are lucky. There is the vehicle. Come on move, fast bloody. Bloody drunkard, God is right here. Hey, we found God.- Is it? Bro, we lost the van. What? You bloody rascal, how much more shall we walk? It would have been better to die taking that poison. We would escaped this walk. If we had not filled the diesel spending money, we would have gone in auto or van. Oh my God! This bloody Vijayashanti, never leaves the mirror.- Hey go! I cannot any more. Krishna! Yes boss, I cannot. Nageswara Rao No way!- Rama Rao! Hey Rama Rao, what happened? Hey, God will surely get that fellow stealing our van caught. He will then have in my hands. Bro, there is our van. Hey, catch the hands tight. Yes, hold tightly. Nobody should fear. First, you do not fear. Oh, is this vehicle yours? Why, any doubt? We walked for 35 Km. Both slippers and knees wore off because of you. Take it light thinking you walked to Tirumala, boss! We get goodwill walking to Tirumala. It is tiredness when we walk at other places. All of you get down the vehicle first. Love matter boss, there is a chase from back. They would kill if we get caught. Do I look an idiot? Killings are in Kurnool, but not in Nellore. People live in peace here. Oh no! That is why, you should listen to the elders. Come on drive fast, they are going. Bloody, why are you slowing down? Why did it stop? What happened bloody? See whether engine heated up or tyre got punctured? Ok brother. All are fine sir. Brother, vehicle is not stopped because of engine getting heated or tyre puncture. I stopped it thinking waste of petrol as it is a down. Is this any share auto to stop the engine bloody? Do not beat me, I stop the vehicle when a down comes and it is my habit. Hey British! Brother Oh no, Kesava Reddy! He does not know that I am the reason behind his mother getting mad, why should I fear? What are you here, bloody? I came to meet you bro. But, by then seeing someone kidnapping mother, I am chasing. Hey, why to lie saying mom and all. If you say for the dog, he too would search, right? What Kesava, what do you say? Anyway, glad to meet you. I am Who is this fellow? My brother’s son bro, a bit mad. Hey do not frame relations and try to reduce the shares, I will not accept. Have I not said bro. a bit mad? They did a big mistake by taking the girl along with mom. I will not kill normally, come on get in the vehicle. Boss, drive a bit fast. We have the programme in Kavali. What programme now man? Do not say so boss, we will not have food, if we do not do that. Ok, I will think about it. Bloody, as if this van is his own Why does the auditor say it was just 5 lachs caught by the IT people? What 5 lachs bro, they had taken total 75 crores before my eyes. Do not believe them at all. I will know the exact amount by morning, British. I should escape with the diamond, by the time he gets to know the matter. I have a small doubt. Is it with the money you stole from him that you bought that diamond?

Hey, I will increase your share by 20% more. 20 day before, 20 yeaterday and 20 now and that is a total of 60, ok? Hey Kesava! What again bloody? I called just for fun. Move on. I will find out where that Surya is. Till then go somewhere leaving Vizag sir. Are you saying me to escape? That is, if I take you to the station, all the people who treated you as good all these days would say you as a bad man. All does not need to know whether we are good or bad sir. It is enough if our inner soul knows that. Sir, all these are the words that exists in books. Those in books are not in life and those in life are not written in books. No time sir, please start now. What he is saying too is for our good hubby. Let us go to our Raja for some days. Instead of going to the son without responsibility, it is respectful for me to be going to jail. Hey son in law! What man? There in the TV… Wait, I am coming. Come here. What happened dude? See! Million dollar question is where is Surya now who escaped with the total of 75 crores? He was the person, who came the day before to your house, right? Yes dude We respected that Surya fellow like God. But, we never expected him to cheat like this. We are not understanding what is our baby’s situation now? Police are investigating as to who all are more in this scam. I did not expect him to do so dude. Not knowing whom to believe and whom not to. Hey! Son in law! Sir, there was a girl here. Where is she Someone had just come and taken her by force. Shit.. move. Ammu! move on dude. Hey, you go that side. Ok Raja! Raja! Ammu. Raja! Bro, we found the girl. We are nearby and coming there bro. Hey, Brother it seems the girl is found. You and your girl, bloody. First ask whether the girl has the puppy in her hands or not. If I hear about puppy again from his mouth, I will not even see that he is your relative. Ok bro. I will push all the bullets in his mouth. What shall we now son in law. Wait bloody It is dirtied all my dress, bloody. Why are you here? While going for a programme in Kotappakonda, we stopped here to give your belonging. What is that? What? Hey Sobhan Babu, bring that animal artiste. Stop man, we ourselves are roaming for food and how can we feed it Pedigree. That is why.. Bloody, I am having to wander on highways because of you instead of happily marrying and going for honeymoon. I am leaving you without scolding for the facility of the censor people. I do not know what I would do to you, if I see you again before my eyes. Go, get out. That is all. Is it gone or not? It is gone son in law, cool. Boss, here. Why is he so irritated with dogs? I beg you, this is the climax and if you ask him now, he would say till tomorrow morning. Is it required for us? Come bloody! Ammu! What? Do you feel that you are beautiful? You are the granddaughter of Raghava Reddy. This mad public would vote by saying name of that old man. You are still alive for that reason. Kesava Reddy, I thought you as a respectable person to give my daughter. Do you behave so bad? Hey.. Ammu.. Bloody, you thought to give your daughter for enjoying the status of father in law to MLA. Did you really want to give your daughter thinking me respected person? Go and get ready, go. Bloody, puppy is neither with Kesava Reddy’s mother nor with this girl. That means it would be with that fellow. Call him once, I will tell. Come, come out. Come on call him. Bloody! Ok, call him. Hello! Bloody, where is my dog? This guy again for my death, bloody! You are calling me saying puppy, what is in it bloody? That is all immaterial for you. You bloody, you did a big mistake by hiding the diamond in belt. You are again doing a mistake by not telling him that. Wait, I beg you. Let me talk to him. Look Boss, I am Giri speaking. Do you have the dog with you? Have you even gone mad about dog along with him? Do you think our British fellow is any mad dog to wander around you saying dog? That is not an ordinary dog bro, a diamond dog. What is a diamond dog? Listen! Because there is a diamond worth 75 crores in its neck. At the same time, go and say even to that Kesava Reddy fellow. Then we will be gone. You wait, I know it. Why is this Giri talking madly? Bro, have you heard or not. Ok, let me have a guess hit. Hey, give the phone to him. Here, he wants to talk. He may ask for share and I will not accept if you touch my percentage. What bloody, you too want a share? I do not need any of your share. If you want your diamond, I want my girlfriend. Hey, he is asking to bring that girl. Give it here, I will talk. Look boss, not just the girl but we will even bring her grandmother. What is the guarantee that you have the dog? Make it speak once. You mad fellow, how will the dog speak? Correct, ok make it bark once. Hey, bark once like a dog. Why is the dog saying bro in law instead of saying Bow? You and your bloody doubts, it barked correct but you heard it wrong. Ok, we will call after an hour. We will hand over the girl and you are handing over dog to us. Is the deal ok? Ok deal dude. It is me who should set the deal, right bloody? Oh, Ego has shot up. What matters who sets the deal? First think of how to get the girl out from here, come on baby. Go and bring it dude? Which? That dog. Is that any human to be calm if you scold? It is an animal. Its ego got hurt and it is gone. Is it gone? Yes, it is gone. Hey, now that is my future dudes. Go and search, it would be somewhere here. How much is in its neck, 75000? Not thousands but crores bloody. Crores? Hey, go and search first. This is the girl’s room, all the best. Hey British, it is sure to bring that girl either you say or not. But my share which is 60 should become 80 now. Think of it. Why is that rest 20, you take even that. Looks like he felt bad. Do I look so bad, that 20 is yours and you take it.celebrate the festival Let us go. Have you frightened? Are you frightened? Where is my Subramanyam? If you ask again about Subramanyam, I will press your neck and kill. Subramanyam is not there and will not come. We have total rights on him. We will take him once we find. Has this mad lady understood or not? Sorry dude, it seems this is not the girl’s room and is up there. I will tell if I see that mad lady again. Bro, will anything happen if a human bites? Nothing dude. Oh, looks like you are habituated. Let us leave before anyone sees us, come. Wow, these girls will not have the interest any other thing like they have in running away bro. My baby, come on, we shall leave. Ammu, I did a mistake dear. We need you to be happy than these prestige and all. Do not worry about us. You go carefully. Come on! Move on faster. You will move from here only if you give me my Subramanyam. Do you want Subramanyam? Yes Just wait. Show your brow. Here Bloody, what have you done? This is called brow treatment in Renigunta. Mad baby will not get up for five minutes. Come on, follow me. Yes, follow. Come on, come. Come on, come. What do you think of Kesava Reddy? He is like burning Sun, Great tree! Hey, what are you doing here? Nothing bro, I am saying great about your greatness. How can I repay you British, Thanks dude. No problem if it is delayed, praise me well. Ok bro.. I will see to that nobody disturbs you here, ok? Ok bro. Go..bro. Hey bro, this is the first time you are using it, right? What ? Your brain. To hell with your shy feeling. Sir, come sir. Come on move. Hey Subbu! Kesava! Come sir, come. Faster, fast. Move on! Bye baby Subramanyam, hey Subramanyam! I am not understanding whether she is calling the dog or me. What? That British is taking away the girl, bloody! Can you not see that I am in an important work, you mad lady? Do not irritate, go to a side and play. Oh no! I understood with your hit sister that you are back again. Bro, Mummy returns! Mother! Mother! I am very happy that you are back to normal by marriage time mother. How will marriage take place without the girl, you mad idiot? What are you saying mother? Sister I came to know where are they. I just got the call. Marriage will take place to the time we thought of. I am not understanding why that British fellow took the girl, mother. He would say himself if you keep the knife on his neck, come on. Move guys. Hold on! What, are you going to the station for picking me up? I have come, keep the car in side. Who are you? Gates, Bill Gates! If the bride groom inside is a fan, I am his switch. I am the remote if he is the TV. Do you know who the groom is? Our Raja. We are going to him, get into the vehicle. Bloody, we will come to the cotton mill in two minutes. Girl only when you give the dog. Remember this. Silky! Silky! Where is it man, Silky! Where are you dear, Silky! Silky! Aunty, have you seen any dog? No! Hey bloody, stop. Hey, did you see it? No bro. Hey, did you see it? No bro. Go and search first. Why did you not find if you search? Go and search bloody. Silky Hey drunkard idiot, look for it. We shall find it. Hey drunkard idiot, look for it. We shall find it. We shall find it. Have you found it? No bro You? Where is it, where? Yes! Hey go.. Have you seen? No, not found boss. Where are you, bloody Silky? It was a mistake for me to make you innocent get into the Municipality van. It was my mistake to drive you away, when you came with love to me. I will apologise to you and your whole breed. Please be seen. I, you and Ammu will live happily. Be seen Silky, please. Son in law! What dude? Look there. Hey Silky! You are lucky son in law. Hey Silky dude. Raja! Ammu! Get down bloody! No I will not. Why? There will be that black fellow and he would call me brother in law and I get irritated. Still, we should not go for such silly deals, we are billionaires. That small rowdy British fellow will take care of such. Who, our sir? Yes, that fellow. I actually thought of killing all once I find the dog. But, I am happy seeing you like this Whenever you have any problem, do not forget that British is there. See you. What about my silky then? You do not be tensed. I will get Silky. We finally did it. I was frightened whether we would be dead in Kesava Reddy’s hands not getting this diamond. The tension he gave us for two days will not be gone unless I scold him badly. Call him once. Is it? Yes bro, we are billionaires and should not fear to poor fellow like that Kesava Reddy. Wait, I will connect to him. Talk, come on talk. No sir Where are you bloody? Why have you taken the girl? Bloody, she is like an emblem of innocence. Yes You are like a relative of vulture. Yes Is there any meaning in a marriage for you both? Raja is the husband to be for that girl. You forget about her now. Do not shout idiot. Shall I tell you another matter? IT people have not taken your 75 crores. I stole that. Hey, Kesava Reddy this is me, son of British’s brother. You said me mad whenever I spoke about the dog, right? In fact there is the diamond worth 75 crores in the belt of that dog. Hey, shall I tell you another bonus point? I am the reason for your mother to go mad. It was me who drove that van. Hey, I had given Renigunta brow treatment to her before I came. Is she alive or have you lifted her dead body? Bloody, I may even leave that British, but you will be dead in my hands. Hey man, a poor should never tell punch dialogues. Keep the phone and have curd rice. Bye! This is not a puppy, but a sweet. Wait, Wait. this is a bad time. If you see now even diamond becomes coal. I will tell you, wait. Bro, bad time is over. Now you take out the diamond from the dog’s belt. Hey diamond! Hey, there is no belt in its neck. v What? No diamond? See properly. Saying not to want the share, that Raja has taken away the full diamond. Will he cheat so much by making us believe? I will somehow get my share. Come on reverse the vehicle. What is going back? You said all truths to Kesava Reddy till now and scolded him badly. If we are caught to him, we cannot even identify our dead bodies if shown to us. He would kill like that. Hubby, have you found the dog or not? I found only that, I am coming. What more to do now? Me, my van and the pollution. Go on. Tell mom! Hey, they have arrested father Hey, wait for a minute. Mom, nothing will happen to father. I am here. I am starting immediately. You heard it, right? I need to go home urgently. Finalise our matter at the earliest. Who are you bloody? Why have you all come into my life? I was ready setting everything to become an MLA. When I thought of marrying her for popularity, she giving me a hand got ready to run away with you. That bloody Giri has made my mother go mad, who planned my political career with care. When I got 75 crores by killing that Surya and kept it for election expenses, our British fellow has taken that. My target now is not to become MLA, but to kill you all badly. You looting money of poor kids operations will become a criminal, but not an MLA. Poor man who lived saying service there is in jail now being arrested. I too have now fixed for one thing. That is to make you sit in jail for lifelong, who wanted to sit in Assembly for five years. Hey Kesava, I did a mistake by saying no murders till the election is over. I want to kill that fellow and sip his blood. Oh no, was it with her that I danced in the night? I now understood one thing. Any mother would grow his kids saying morals. But, you grew him teaching filthy language and has thus become so. Bloody, will you say my mother? Sister! Sister! What happened sister? Sister! Sister! What happened sister? Sister! Mom, what happened? Mom, get up. Sorry mom, it missed him and hit you. Nothing happened to you, right? Mother! Where is my Subramanyam? Subramanyam! Subramanyam! Where is my Subramanyam? Bro, sister is again back to Vasantha Kokila. Subramanyam. Where is my Subramanyam? I said many times till now that Surya is not of that type of a man. Sir, he would have not run away. Something has happened somewhere sir. Why will he say by asking so smoothly? He should be Stop sir. This is the 75 crores that you think Surya sir has taken and ran away sir. He has not run away. That Nellore Kesava Reddy and Veerabhadramma have killed him They killed him? Yes, what I am saying is true. You will know who else are involved by doing an enquiry sir. Seeing this situation, I remember a story heard in my childhood sir. It seems a kid wrote letter to God saying to be in problems and wanting 1000 rupees urgently. As the letter had address of God, a post man read that letter. Feeling pity on that kid, he sent 900 with him to the kid by money order. Kid receiving the money has written another letter to God. He wrote, God you sent me 1000 with pity on me but the postman took 100 from it and somehow punish that postman. The kid’s was innocence in that story. Here, you should decide what is yours. It is fine if you do not recognise good, but do not insult like this. Because there are very few good people in this world. You come father. Ajay.. I thought he was wandering without any job. But, by saving lives of so many kids he is become a great person. Love you Raja. Who is this boy sir? My son. Raja, all the operations done today are a success. Is it dad, super! Where are you? In our Srinu’s marriage. I will not wash. I will not wash the feet of that black fellow. You bloody rascal. Come on brother in law. The feet I wanted to cut, now I am having to wash the same feet. Stop son, as per the tradition you have to wash the feet of brother in law. Take the water son. Come on wash them. Brother in law, I kept the feet comfortable for you. Wash them now. Not water bloody, I will wash them with acid. Why do you not give ten thousand? I will arrange for a programme with my dance troupe and make the marriage grand. If I had got that diamond not you but would have called in Shakira to shake. I missed the chance. Ok, when have you stolen that diamond? I had not stolen that. Then? When I was getting into Vizag bus after my fight with Kesava Reddy, Then.. Not there bloody, here. Boss, I have just seen you searching for the dog. It was me who stole its belt. Are you thinking why the robber is back instead of leaving? There was this glass piece in that. Other than iron, nothing else in the world is important to me. Thanks boss. Hit dude Subramanyam! Hey you hit. Slowly! Subramanyam!Subramanyam! Hey you hit hard. Mom! Subramanyam What is this brother? How much ever we hit sister, she is not getting normal? Hey you hit hard. Subramanyam Doctor, what to do now? I too am not understanding that. If we know where exactly she was hit, we too can hit at the same spot and make her normal. She was hit in Nellore, right? Bloody I remember that guy saying some brow treatment, Doctor. Brow treatment? I never heard of such treatment in my long service. Who is that great fellow giving that treatment?
