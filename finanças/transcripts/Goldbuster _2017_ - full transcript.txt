Prestige Garden Hello? This is the food delivery man. I think you gave me the wrong address. There doesn't seem to be anyone living here. Stay away! Jeez... What? Announce yourself before you come in next time! Your face looks like a Halloween party gone wrong! You know that right? (Little Boss) Come here. Hurry, hurry! It's the Boss. Are you ready? 1, 2, 3 Hello Boss! Can't you see how angry I am right now? You guys are just living your lives over there, huh! I haven't heard from you for days. How many have you scared off? One! One food delivery man! I asked you to scare off the residents. What's the point of scaring a delivery man? We've made significant progress in scaring the following residents: Wang Baojian, Male, Profession: Chinese medicine doctor, Middle-aged widower. I haven't made a single medical error in my entire career. Except that one time on my wife. Baojian believes his wife's spirit will come back looking for him. So no matter how hard we try to scare him, he never runs away. Lan! Chicken Little, Wang Baojian's son, Profession: kid. He hasn't spoken a word since his mother's death. He may be a mute. We tried our best to scare him, but he still remains silent. Kids these days are fearless. Ping, Profession: Webcam girl, Erotic type. Hi guys, I'm back! Our pranks work best on her, but perhaps a little too well. Ghost-seeing has become her hottest livestreaming program. She's Internet-famous now. And now so am I. Jin San and Li Juhua. They're inventors. But I think they're actually drug dealers. The new formula. Try it. Isn't this just detergent? Isn't it clean? Considering they're well-educated people, we scare them using the most advanced technologies. Holy mother! Ming and Ren. Two Hong Kong gangsters, also fugitives. Ming is an idiot. He believes he's actually a cop. People like you should die a thousand times! Ren is even worse. He... is a pervert. Come to me! As for these two sickos... We haven't come up with any suitable methods to scare them. Enough! Don't play dumb! I'm giving you one more day. If you still can't scare off the residents, you won't need to dress like ghosts anymore. I'll send you to the grave instead! (The Purge: Prestige Garden residents) Come here. I think... The ghost must be Lan! She was wearing a red dress the day she died. She must blame me for not saving her life. She wants me to pay it back with my life. Baojian... I don't blame you for not curing me! Take good care of Chicken Little! Baojian... Let us be husband and wife in the next life! Yes we will. We can visualize it ourselves. You don't need to roleplay for us. I think... - it must be— - And I think we should use some logic to analyze the whole matter. We've lived here for 584 days by growing vegetables on the rooftop. We're self-sufficent now. We generate electricity with manpower. But for our water supply, we're totally dependent on the weather. We've been threatened, blackmailed, and provoked! They even put coffins in front of our doors! Why? Because they want to scare us! But they have not succeeded. Why? Because someone like me is here. A firm atheist! For me, any ghosts or spirits are just paper tigers! I think— - It has to be... - It has to be Lan. She's here to have me pay my debt! How is that possible? Are you guys going to allow a girl her right to speak at all! If there really is a ghost, hire a ghostbuster! But ghostbusters aren't easy to find! Where can we find one? Well, I've been working on film crews for years. And not for nothing! Do you know what the most prominent feature of a film crew is? Casual sex? Wrong! It's superstition! One time when I was in bed, a director told me a story. I know what you guys are thinking now. That's not the point I'm trying to make. Many directors have told me stories! But that's not the point either. What I'm trying to say is, the director told me about a master ghostbuster. This person's name is Ling. Don't tell me she stood us up... I don't think she's gonna come... Here she is! Hi Auntie, have you lost your way? There used to be no roads in the world. Roads appear when more and more people walk on it. So if there was no road, Why would you say I've lost my way? I'm fine, I'm fine. Damn, another pair of stockings. This is part of my resume. Paul Walker... Steve Jobs... Michael Jackson... Wow... Marilyn Monroe! Bruce Lee! Wait, wait a second. These people are all dead, aren't they? Only masters have the chance to take pictures with superstars! I have travelled to the otherworld to take pictures with these deceased superstars. That makes me the true master! You guys know the rules. Ping. Thank you! You're welcome. Four hundred? Didn't we agree on one hundred each household? Ling, you don't know the situation now. This building that we're living in has only 4 households left. 30 kilometers! And only four hundred dollars? I'm not a cleaning service! Well... If you think the amount doesn't meet your expectations, then... You're the most reasonable one after all. We don't need you. Master, you can go back now. You know I actually hate money. I believe fate brought us together. May I have a word with you? Master. If you really have to bust this ghost, I beg of you. If it's a male ghost, beat him to death. But if it's a female ghost, would you please bring her to me? I suspect that the ghost is my late wife. You know... Master! Can you hear my wife calling me? Baojian... Baojian... You're freaking roleplaying again! Are you okay Baojian? Now that we've paid you, start working! There are indeed dirty things in here. Let me handle this! What's wrong? It really is dirty. Allow me to resolve this. What the heck? Something's off. What's going on? Aiyah! Luckily for you guys, I'm here! Cleaning is my expertise! It was that bad? To be honest, if I'd come a bit later, we wouldn't have been able to clean it all up. Isn't it much better now? The quality of your work is pretty decent! A lucky charm for you. One for each of you Bless you! Here you go. Give me a call if you need anything else. Toilet unclogging, lock picking, fruit picking, massaging... Whatever you need, just call me! Does anyone want insurance? Don't let her go! What's going on? Don't try to hustle us! Are you a travelling performer or what? Stop touching me! We hired you to bust ghosts, not to clean the toilet! Thanks to my magical energy, you know, the ghosts dare not reveal themselves! Hands over your head! Okay, do you really want to see ghosts? Who just said his wife died? Jeez, Dr. Wang! Why are you wearing that? Ghosts are attracted to the color red. I'm helping the Master lure out the ghost. Seeing you, the ghost will drop dead. Are you wearing a bra! Light the incense! Ok now. Blow as hard as you can! The bigger the smoke, the better. Can you see me? Vaguely... That means you're not blowing hard enough! Harder! Dirty things only reveal themselves when there's smoke. Harder! Abracadabra! Reveal yourselves, ghosts! Like hell you can find any ghosts! A bunch of idiots! I'm crying because of the smoke! - Ling, what should we do? - Chicken Little! Chicken Little! Jin San! Lan? Jin San! Where are you Jin San? Jin San? Jin San? Ahhh a ghost! What are you afraid of? It's just me. Are you nuts? Why are you wearing a wig? I wanted to dress up more like Lan. This way she and I can connect faster. You! Take it off! Ahhh a ghost! It's me! it's me! Here, hold this for a sec. Ling sprayed water all over my face! Thank god I use waterproof makeup. But let me do some touch-ups. Give me some light. Done! So quick? Ahhh a ghost! Who? Who took my wig? Everyone don't panic! Everyone stay calm! I can't stay calm! Everyone stay calm! The calmer we are, the safer! Whoever you find, place your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you. How's it going? Is everyone here? Yes! Count off. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Don't we have only seven people? I want to count for my wife, too. Why are you still wearing this wig! Stop fighting. We'll count your wife in. Now we're eight, let's do the count-off again. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine How come there's a nine? Why's there a nine? Nine? - Nine? - Who is nine? If you can count for your wife, I can also count for my Juan! Are you crazy? What a psycho! Everyone keep quiet! Request permitted! But no more! You understand me? One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Whose wife is it this time? Hello! Calling headquarters. There's a lady with a serious mouth injury here! Please send over an ambulance. Over. Ling! She's long gone! Did you see it? Was that really Dr. Wang's wife? Where's Ming? Ming! Get out of my way! Ahhh! Why are you carrying her! Get out of my way! Lan! Lan! Run! Lan! Someone give me a hand here! Someone please help! There's an injured person here! Please don't bother to help me, bro... I... I think I'm dying... A bunch of psychos. I don't have time to mess around. Lan! Lan! That's my wife Lan! Run! Lan! Lan! Lan! Come home with me! Please Lan, come home! Put her down! Ahhh a ghost! So the ghost is real! And they only gave me 400. Serves them right! I should get going! What are you doing, kiddo? Hurry up and leave! There's a ghost! Aren't you scared of ghosts? I'm a woman of principle. I don't take children's money. I didn't know that the smallest one was actually the richest man here! Alright! I'll make an exception just this once. I'd like to see what ghost it is. Lan! Help! Lan! Does that mean... the ghost's afraid of the color red? Let the games begin! Gotcha! Lan! Run! Lan! I'm all-powerful and worshipped I'm all-powerful and I don't look back Ren! Are you ok? Ming! You're finally sober! And all swagged up! Baka! You puny Japanese! Go! Go! These two bastards are dressed like it's Halloween. Who do they think they are? Bro, I can't do this anymore! Save it! I just can't. Are you dumb? Is this something you can just quit easily? If we can't scare them off, Boss will kill us. That's not what it is. The current situation is: either we get murdered by Boss, or we get murdered by them. Maybe we should... stop pretending to be ghosts? Did you completely forget our situation? My parents passed away when I was small. There's nothing in my house but bare walls. Life leaves me no other choice but to become successful! And you? What else can you do if you go home, other than inherit your family's pig farm, your father's properties, cars, and 50 acres of land? Tell me, what else do you have? And who else you can be? I don't have any talents, my brother. I might as well just go back and inherit my dad's pig farm, my dad's properties and cars, and his 50 acres of land. Lightbulb Zhao! Have you already forgotten the promise we made at the village entrance? I knew you guys weren't ghosts! Busted! What should we do, man? Run! Don't run! Ahhhhh! Keep quiet! Keep it down, you hear me? I'm telling you! Let go of my hand! She's dead! Be quick! Hide the body! - Be quick! - Hide it first! Hide... Yes I want to hide... Are you that stupid?! I said hide her! Put on the gloves. Don't leave any fingerprints or hair. Be quick! Bro... Bro... The legs? Let's... ...chop them off! Go look for a saw. Bro! The legs are gone! This phenomenon... ...can be explained by science. Sometimes, when people die, their reflexes remain active. Reflexes. Think of shrimp. When you boil shrimp, and you dump them in hot water, their legs can still move for a while. Yes! Can we just go? We can't leave in such a rush. We must dispose of the body first. What you mean is... Let's... ...burn her! Look for something to start the fire with. Does this work? Are these good? Aren't these combustible? You know what your biggest problem is? Lack of education! I saw it even back in primary school. You didn't have the makings of a good student! Reflexes! Can a reflex go this far? She... She has delayed reflexes! This time there will be no reflex or any kind of reaction! Let's not burn the body. Wait why? It is a disgrace to the deceased! You're right! Why don't we find some strong acid and corrode her? You're such a perv! Let's just burn her then! The smell would be too strong if we burned her! It'll get all smoky! Acid also smells. Just wash off the acid smell! It's okay. Don't be afraid. Regarding why this trashcan moved... ...it... This place can't be so easily haunted. If it were, why would they pay us so much to be ghosts? Dead people wake up only when there's thunder. Ahhhhh! What are you two doing? What the hell are you doing? What have you done? How much time did I give you? Do you know how much pressure I'm under? You know how many illegitimate children Dad has? If I can solve the problems that he can't, all his wealth will be passed on to none other than me! Oh my god... I get all excited just thinking about it! But what have you done! Show me how scary you can be, now show me. I'm scared, really. You guys need to watch and learn! See what's really scary. Faint now. See? He's scared to death. Already the 4th one this month, you know? Alright, stop the gibberish, just go. Killed...killed... We killed someone! You killed someone for me? My god... I'm so touched! I'm really touched! How about this? Show me the corpse. If you can show me the corpse, I'll offer you two double the payment. Is that alright? Let's go. Hurry up! Get me an outfit. Isn't this just fun? Where's the body? Where? Not the slightest trace! Head... Turn around... I'm not afraid! What can you accomplish with fear? There's no such thing as ghosts. Have you seen any ghosts before? Huh? The body of a ghost should be ice cold. My death was extremely miserable... So cold... You guys look the same as me! Does that mean... you're all ghosts as well? Yes, yes! The same species! We're all in the same ghost club. The ghost club... is a real mess. Auntie... as the saying goes... A single building... A single building can't accommodate... A single building can't accommodate 4 ghosts Right! You're a newcomer. We... We'll excuse ourselves now. Let's go. Wait a second! When I died, I couldn't see my murderers' faces clearly. Have you seen two bastards pretending to be ghosts? Revenge has no end. Who knows how many flowers have fallen? I humbly advise you to get yourself familiar with your new identity as soon as possible. Learn how to be inclusive. Learn how to let go. Amitabha. Stay focused. Don't be impulsive... Let's go. Boss. You're a vampire. I don't think you have to jump like us. You know nothing! What a coincidence! We're all ghosts, we're afraid of nothing! What a coincidence! Only humans sweat. Ghosts do not. Actually I... I drowned to death. And you? I was... I was killed by the heat... I... Auntie, why don't you... Why don't you make a guess, Auntie? No I won't! Auntie...I... I... That day was extremely hot, and then... and then I died from drowning. Isn't that a bummer? Help me! It's dinner time! A treat for you all! Help me untie these ice bags. I'm freezing! Next trick. Cheers! 585 days! Ling has helped us get through another day! Chicken Little! Make a thicker mark for today! Today is a memorable day. Since we're all so happy, why don't we treat Ling to dinner to celebrate our success in keeping our homes and fending off evil power! Great, thank you! Cheers! Who's gonna pay? Of course we'll split! You all enjoy the food then! Chicken Little and I are suddenly not very hungry. Do you guys have to be that miserable? If the developers pay you compensation, then why don't you just leave? The amount must be too little! Alright. I'll negotiate with them on your behalf, okay? We'll share the extra amount 50/50 No deal? 40/60 then, that's my bottom line. Cheers! Ling, it's not a matter of money. Since we don't have landlords anymore, we can live here rent-free. No one knows we're here. For two gangsters who are already over the hill, it's really hard for us to find another place like this. I came here ten years ago. On the first night, I finally got a peaceful night of sleep. I don't need to worry about my enemies anymore, and I can see this guy when I wake up. Even though there's not much hair left on top, being able to grow old is bliss for me. Compared to yours, this story of mine is undoubtedly soul-stirring. Let me— You don't need to share it anymore. We all know about it. You're staying here because you'd like to see your wife again. It's so annoying repeating the same story over and over again! I'm not leaving because I want my son to meet his mom one day. Otherwise this smart, good kid will never speak again! I'm not pursuing anything in my life. My only hope is that in my next life, my son Chicken Little will be able to speak loudly and clearly. One day, he'll tell me, "Dad!" "I'm a big boy now!" "I can take good care of myself!" There's one thing that I've always wanted to tell you guys. If you think your stories are painful and extremely sad, listen to mine. I invested all my money in my masterpiece invention and went bankrupt. I was deceived and lost my patent. Sad and frustrated, together with the love of my life, I moved here and live like a recluse. All these painful experiences... don't matter to me at all. Of course they don't matter. A long time ago, I invested all my money in my masterpiece invention and went bankrupt. I was deceived and lost my patent. Sad and frustrated, together with the love of my life, I moved here and live like a recluse, shutting myself off from the world. This is what I call a painful experience! My dear. We're actually telling the same story. What makes your experience more painful than mine? You were the one who cheated me out of my money and stole my patent. Who do you think is in more pain? I actually don't have any particular reason to stay. But this is my home! Why do they think they can just make us go? I've been living here since childhood! So you guys are like family to me. Great. From tonight onwards, we're one big family! One big family! Your stories are nothing compared to what I've been through. So you have an even more tragic story? Did you experience doomsday at the end of 1999? Even the Earth didn't experience it. but you did? That day, my dad went out to buy chicken and fish. I told him not to buy too much food, since it was just us two. He said we could store some in case there was rain later. Turns out he secretly invited our relatives to celebrate my 9th birthday with me. If you were 9 years old in 1999... Ling, I didn't know you're a 90s kid. When they entered the house I heard a bang! All the lights went off. Turns out there was a landslide. Every single one of them died. Except for me. Suddenly, they all disappeared from my life. My dad left nothing behind but these broken sunglasses. I cried for seven days and nights. I cried so much that my eyes hurt. All of a sudden, I saw him with my left eye! He said to me, "My dear daughter." "You must remember always to help those in need." "Wtih great power comes great responsibility!" Ever since then, I've been helping people out of my own pocket. I thought I finally was gonna make some money this time and be able to burn some joss paper for my dad. But with only 400, I don't even have enough to buy a train ticket home! I wasn't able to fulfill my duty as a daughter, and now I still can't! We all have parents, but what have I done for them? I was such an unfilial daughter! We gangsters value brotherhood the most. Okay everyone, let's give Ling our valuables to express our sincere gratitude. It's that easy? Oh my dad's spirit must have heard me. A call from a potential client! Ren! Grab your weapons! What's going on? There are a lot of people outside! Who? Triad or Mafia? Are you drunk or what? You guys couldn't escape so you called backup, huh! Don't waste your time here! It's just us two! Ren! Forget it, let's show them who's boss. Ming. Let's kill these motherfuckers! Assholes! Don't rush into it! I'm all-powerful and worshipped I'm all-powerful and won't look back I'll overturn the world and make my own law Like a vicious wolf with flashing eyes Ah finally a living soul! Hurry up Ming! Run! Ahhh Next time don't order takeout under such circumstances! Throw him into the elevator! Are you okay? Help! Help! Help! Infected by an unidentified virus, a large number of zombies have flooded onto the streets, attacking pedestrians. Our colleague is reporting live from the city center. Good evening, I'm on Main Street now. As you can see, I'm currently surrounded by zombies. This area has already been occupied. Let's interview one of the victims now. Come with me. Young lady, how does it feel being bitten? Go away! You even stole expired canned food? What the hell is wrong with you? Ling and the others are goners! We can't just let them die. It's over! The delivery man has become takeout himself! There are too many of them and too few of us! What should we do? Hold on! You're finally here! I can't untie it! We can't hold it any longer! What should we do? Burn them! Hang in there! Help us! We can't hold on any longer! So... sorry! Go away! Ling! Ling! What should we do? Let's go! Go upstairs! Up! Hurry! What now? Let me! Let me do it! Can't kick it open! Wow! Iron Head kung fu? You know Iron Head kung fu! Let me help you! Iron your ass! I live on the rooftop! I was just getting my key! The zombies are coming, be quick! Hurry up! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! This way! Keep pushing! Over there! This way! Ling, what should we do? What should we do? Ling! What should I do? What should we do? Ling, what should we do? I'm turning into the evil dead! I'll chop your arm off! No! Let me do it myself. I'll do it! Chop it! Behind you! Where is it? Behind you! Behind you! Behind! Behind! Behind! It's just death, nothing serious! What now? Don't force me to play my trump card! What now? Wow... Is this the magic of using one's breast to turn bad luck into good? You guys leave now! I'll solve this myself! I'll use my body to buy time for you! Move! I'm using my breast to buy you time! What are you doing? Just quickly tell us what we should do! Go to the other side! How?! There's nowhere to go! Go to the other side first! - We'll lose our homes! - If we leave, there's no turning back! Your lives are more important! That's impossible! The ladder isn't long enough! Then use your bodies to extend the ladder! What kind of idea is that? Hang in there! Watch out! Hurry up, will you? I'm a little scared! Hang in there, Ren! Oh no! Ladies and children go first! Bring along Chicken Little! Be quick! Stop crying! You can hate me after I take you to the other side, and I'll just jump from here, okay? And I'll be dead! You'll lose your dad forever! Are you happy with that? I wanted to cure your mom too! Chicken Little, you have to survive. Only then can you grow up. Only then can you understand my words. Only then will you stop blaming me! Papa... Don't talk before we reach the other side! What did you say? Papa, climb quickly! I want to pee! Chicken Little, you're doing great! Next! My dear, don't be afraid! Follow me, my dear! I'm scared! Stop wasting time! You need to support your wife! Honey! Just look at me and scold me like you always do. That way you won't be afraid. Let's just keep moving forward, okay? Let's go! You nerdy old wretch! Yes! You always pee in the shower! You always scratch your smelly feet and then sniff your fingers! Keep going darling! Just like that. Darling! Darling! Darling! I won't love you less no matter what! My love! Ling! Ling! Go! I'm running out of time! Ling! - Go! - You should go first! The characters I play in such scenarios never manage to survive! All the characters you've played so far are minor roles! At this very moment, you're the leading actress! The lead never dies! Come quickly you bitch! I! Am! The! Leading! Actress! Quickly! Almost there! Ling, what are you doing? Just go! Ming hold tight! Just go! I'm a police officer! Don't be silly now! Just get over here! I'm really a policeman. 20 years ago, my superior accidentally deleted all the undercover cops' data. And now... not a single person knows I'm a cop. You asshole! Before I die, I simply want people to know that I'm a good person! Ming, you bastard! You kept me in the dark for so many years! I trusted you! Ming! Ming! Ming! Ming! Please wake up, Ming! Are you okay? I'm okay I'm asking if what you just said is true! Is everyone safe? I can notify headquarters. Stop pretending! I'm a policeman! I can kill you in one shot! He's just ill again. It's alright as long as he's alive. Doomsday is coming! We're the only ones alive! We have to support each other! Don't be afraid! I'm a cop, listen to me. Everyone, keep calm! Don't run around! How come the doors are locked? They were open a second ago! We can't go back anymore! It's over! We can't get back in! Come on. This way! We don't know anything! We were conned too! Acting again? Let's welcome our chairman, Mr. Xu! Spectacular! Better than any zombie movie I've seen! For real, if you guys had some money, we could definitely be good friends. Good friends, my ass! Young and rebellious! Forget it. Just give us the amount you're willing to pay. We'll just take the money and leave. Wang Baojian how can you change your mind so quickly? We're not here for the money! What this young lady just said makes sense. You guys have held us up for such a long time. Have I asked for any compensation? We've just met. And you're already asking for money? What you're doing is illegal, you know! Did I beat you up? Or yell at you? Did I hire all these people? Nope! These people all purchased properties soon to be built here. They are legit consumers waiting for property value to increase. Cut! Give me some more rottenness. Be rotten! Give me a hand! How can you fool someone if you act this way? Don't you know there's a difference between zombies and corpses? Boss, it has been more than a month! You asked us not to brush our teeth or shower. We eat stinky tofu and chew on betel nuts. We just bought apartments from you. I really can't stand it anymore! A zombie knows no pain! Okay, no pain! Come hit me! Stop joking around! Whack me! Hit me again! You guys want to flip properties without investing anything? If you want to earn other people's hard-earned money, you need to work harder! You guys have given up on a good life, but these people still want to make their fortune. Isn't that right? A simple way of describing this whole matter would be a civil dispute. To put it in a more admirable way, this is the victory of the people! As a bystander, how can I take credit for such a great achievement? Ling. It's alright, it's alright, you don't have to applaud me! It's my duty! It's what I do! It's what I do! Alright, alright! How's everything? Did you all get your money? Why are you pulling such long faces? Not enough money? What money? Ling. How can such a sensible person like yourself be as foolish as they are? It's never enough when it comes to money. You always want more. It's easier if you live without it. Didn't we make an agreement on the phone! Why aren't you keeping your word! Stop talking about credibility when you're a swindler yourself! Oh my dad's spirit must have heard me. A call from a potential client. Ling, I'm sure you know what's the right thing to do. This standoff doesn't do anyone any good. All I want is the land. Find a way to make them leave. I'll give them their money, and I'll give you your money. Think about it. Are you okay? I'm turning into the evil dead! Ling! Ling! We trusted you! How could you work hand in glove with them! I didn't! I simply wanted to help you all! Why would you deceive people you wanted to help? He deceived me! He's the swindler! If I'm a swindler, then what are you? Why are you lying to yourself when you're only supposed to lie to them? People like you who cheat small money are swindlers, And those who make it big, like me, are businessmen. Get rid of them! No way! No! Ling! That's enough! We won't believe you anymore! They're not the ones who kicked us out! You did! Let's leave! Let's go. Don't go! How can you give up so easily! You haven't gotten your money yet! Come back! I didn't know it'd turn out like this! I never meant to hurt you all! I just wanted to help you get your money so that you could have a good life! You can stop now, Ling. They're already gone! Aren't you tired? Why do you have to be so mean? We're the same kind of people. You don't have to say such a thing. My son. What a smart kid. When he was 10, he knew the addition and subtraction tables under 10. When he was 12, he knew them under 12. His math abilities are determined by his age. What a prodigy! But thanks to your scare tactics, he can't do any more calculations! Why didn't you realize that you were being so mean to him? Ling, we're actually the same. We're both baddies. It's just that you're an unsuccessful baddie. Please see yourself out. Everyone listen up. Seal off Prestige Garden and blast the building! Let's give Ling our valuables to express our sincere gratitude. Ling, this is my dowry bracelet. Ling, this is my dowry money. Ling, here's my jewelry. How could you leave me out? I've been wearing this gold Rolex for more than 20 years. Wow! A Rolex! Isn't this a little too flashy? It's not working! The battery's dead. A Rolex ran out battery? Are you kidding me? I'll give you something legit. Thank you! What is it? I just removed it. Boss, Boss! Look! Breaking news. The demolition of Prestige Garden was forced to stop due to the intrusion of a mysterious woman. Give me my home back! Give me my home back! Give me my home back! Just let her stay there. She can starve to death. Looking for a place, mister? Hey bro, I have all kinds of movies. What decade are you living in? We all download movies now! (The stars are floating) (We walk side by side) (From strangers to friends) (We treat each other with silent sincerity) Ling! Chicken Little! Let's go! Baojian! What on earth is this? Jin San and Juhua, you have a guest. Jin San! Juhua! Are you guys free? I want to treat you guys to dinner! Eat this! Taste good? Ren, I want to buy ten of these. Go away, I'm not selling them! Let's go, Ming. Take your money back! I'm a cop! Why are you here? Can you forgive me? Never! They're not the ones who kicked us out! You did! We trusted you! How could you work hand in glove with them! I didn't! I simply wanted to help you all! Don't go! I thought we were a family! (Scattered stars are connected in the faraway sky) (Although the road is lined with thorns) (You will undo the loneliness in my heart) Dad, Ling's on TV! (Holding hands we go through ups and downs) (Share happiness and sorrow) (You for me and I for you) (Holding hands we go through trials and troubles) (We are friends) Chicken Little? I sneaked out. Can you see her? I can't see any ghosts. There's no such thing. Didn't you say you've seen your dad before? Of course I have! When I was nine. But after he died, I haven't met him since. I may not be able to see your mother, but I can let her possess me! Chicken Little! Chicken Little, you've grown up so fast! Momma can't even recognize you now! Have you been a good boy? Have you been eating well? You told me that when I could reach the top button in the elevator you'd take me to an amusement park. So I went to the elevetor and gave it a go every day. But, now I can't go inside anymore. I'm not sure if you're keeping your promise... You're fake! Do I not look like her? Come on, show some respect! I know how to do it as well! Be careful! It's my family heirloom! Ling, you've grown up so fast! Papa can't even recognize you now. Have you been a good girl? Have you been eating well? You're fake! My dad wouldn't call me Ling. He used to call me Sweetiepie. Chicken Little! Come over here. My wife isn't that ugly. Ling, what should we do now? You're not afraid that I'll trick you again? Ling! What should we do? Ling, what should we do? Ling, what should we do? Ling! What should we do? Ling! What should we do? Tell us! Let's kill him then! He's surrounded by bodyguards, how do we even get close to him? I heard he takes a dump everyday at 3pm, sharp. That's when his security is the weakest. 20! 19! Then we'll leave it to you two to sneak in. And then what? Jin San, do you know how to make anaesthetics? How numb do you want him to be? I want him to feel nothing even when he's all beaten up and bleeding! One last request. Could you let me finish my business first? Don't you regret it. Where am I? Such a gloomy and horrifying place! And who are you two? I'm the Ox-Head demon. And I'm the Horse-face demon. You must have some idea where you are now. I'm dead? Impossible! What are you doing? What are you doing? Does it hurt? Does it? No it doesn't! Then you're right! A dead person feels no pain. I'm in Hell! Hell! That's impossible! I was only taking a dump! How could I die from pooping? I mean I could've been dehydrated. You must've pooped too hard. There's no way I'm dead! Everyone says that when they're taken here. Where are you taking me? Just follow us. That's an Internet troll. You can go to hell for trolling people online? I went online... What did she say? She said she went online and photoshopped a photo. You can go to hell for photoshopping? I've never photoshopped a photo in my life! You can't do this to me! So you didn't photoshop, you didn't. I did nothing wrong! I should be going to heaven, not hell! Move! - Noooo! - Make yourself at home - Move! - This isn't heaven. This is not heaven! This is not... Newcomer, Richie Xu! Do you admit to the crimes you committed in the secular world? Let's announce all his crimes so that he can realize what he did! Richie Xu! During your fifty-one years of living you killed 16015 people and raped 2000 of them are overlapping cases! Do you still have the guts to say that you're a good person? Over 7000 women, are you kidding me? Even if I'd wanted to, my physical condition wouldn't let me! Even if I had the guts, my balls wouldn't cooperate! I... I only tricked some people in my life. Who did you trick! How did you do it! Please elaborate! I tricked you all. Ling. What are you gonna do now? Tell me if this is how you planned it. You first tell me I'm dead. And then... I get sent to this fake hell. And then I'm so terrified here. Oh so scary! It's so scary! And after that? I'm so terrified that I'll tell you all the bad things I've done. But you've made one terrible mistake. The King of Hell should be wearing shoes! He shouldn't be wearing a pair of slippers with cartoons on them! The shoes you bought were too small? You're wearing slippers to relax your feet? A very creative idea, but poorly executed. What a pity! It is indeed a pity! You are such a clever man. If your son had even half of your wit, you wouldn't have been brought to this place, right? Bring over Xu Tianyu! Emperor, I don't want to die, Emperor! My dad hasn't died yet! My dream hasn't come true, Emperor! Xu Tianyu! My dream has come true, Emperor! True my ass, I'm still alive! Dad? Who told you you're still my dad? Think you're any better, huh! Son! Knock it off! Call me Big Brother! We don't know who's gonna be the dad in our next life yet. It's all fake! What's fake? This looks exactly the same as the hell in Journey to the West! It's all fiction! Why would you believe in fiction! Are you dumb? Are you dumb? I'm talking about the TV show Journey to the West! Just keep your eyes wide open and look around. That's Ling! You've met her! You know her! Oh my god! I've met you before! You've been promoted, Auntie! You've become the supreme leader! Auntie, I don't want to die! In fact, you don't have to die. You're here because your father won't admit to the crimes he committed in the secular world! So I've invited you here to assist in the investigation. Just tell us every single detail, and we'll send you back. Okay. I know everything. It was around 8 years ago. In order to demolish a building, he hired a killer and killed an old man! 7 years ago, in order to acquire a piece of land, he beat up half of the villagers living there until they were disabled. Nonsense! Disabled! Then he even opened a hospital in that village! As for Prestige Garden, he forced everyone out, but he didn't pay them. In his own company, he never allowed the employees to send out invoices. He also stole electricity from the building next door! My god... It caused a blackout in the building! I've worked so hard for so many years to get into the core of the company. I feel very relieved now that I've confessed everything today. That's it. I did what I did back then because I wanted to give you a way out! What a joke! Why can't you give me the opportunity of starting my life again with a clean sheet? Son! Again with the nonsense! Call me Big Brother! May I leave now? You can go back now. Thank you. Emperor. I still have a little request. Auntie. I don't know when I'll visit you again. Can we take a picture together? A picture? Why don't we use my phone? After all, you're our distinguished guest! You still don't know what's happening? One, two, three! That night when I first met your mother, we got too excited. It's my fault, Papa. Don't call me Papa. Let me just call you Big Brother. Can you at least pardon my child? The law knows no mercy, Mr. Xu. Why do you have to be so mean? I've always wanted to be a baddie like you! Unfortunately, I failed to become a successful one. So I became an unsuccessful good person. Just look at yourself. This is what's called the victory of the people! We're going back home! Soon after this, both father and son were convicted of fraud and received the punishment they deserved. But it's said that incarceration actually made them closer. Nonetheless, Prestige Garden didn't escape its fate of demolition. But in a turn of fate, a new developer took over the land. They built a hotel on it, and even provided every former resident a job. Welcome! You're just a security guard. You're not a cop. Bro, can you push harder? I'm pushing as hard as I can! Put some muscle into it, man! Jin San and Juhua really made it big. They invented a new kind of anti-smog mask and even went on TV. You have a big face, you wear it! No you wear it! Yours is bigger! Thank you, dear! Hello, my name is Ping. Please come this way. If you feel lonely at night, I can tell you some stories! Last one, this really is the last one! Dr. Wang! There's no room for another needle! If I don't insert this one, all the previous treatments are a waste! Dr. Wang! Please! One needle won't make any difference! As for me, among all the people, I'm no doubt the most talented and accomplished of all. In my specialized field, no one can beat me. There are indeed dirty things here! Chicken Little! How many times have I told you not to jump on the bed in your shoes? Yet here you are! There's a guest coming soon. Ling, you told me you'd take me to an amusement park! Come over here. Aren't we in one already? There's the ferris wheel over there! Who are you? You're not my husband! Whose husband is he? He's mine! I heard that many celebrities are fans. This is a very special product What do you all think? You should be wearing this mask It's because you have big boobs. Girls who have big boobs usually have a bigger face. If you have a big face, you have to wear plus size bra. This mask would never fit my wife. Why wouldn't it fit me? Dear, this is a surgical mask. Not a festive mask. It's hilarious when you wear this mask, I can't even see your face! You're saying you don't like my small face? No. Babe, we're not talking about your small face. We're saying you have small boobs. What do you think? You scared me! How is this a place to talk about your wife's boob size? What's wrong? Who would talk about his wife's boob size publicly? Babe, it's recording. You even know it's recording! Stop! Stop! Okay! Let's go to the rooftop now! Open it! Open it! Can you hear that? Thanks for the effort. Make a surprised face. Sure. Come on. Give me 20 dollars. Here you go. Surprised! Scared! Terrified! Ling, you didn't do anything. I'm done. Have you seen any good actor have expressions? Have you seen Tony Leung's acting? Easy, easy! You're going to kill them! How could you have mistaken her for someone else? She's so ugly! And you claim you love your wife. She really did look like Lan! God! So it really was true love.
