Hera Pheri, Hera Pheri, Fera Feri! (Flimflam, Shenanigans, Trickery) Fera Feri, Hera Pheri, Fera Feri! 'FERA FERI HERA FERI' "Lord Ram will be throned to become a king" "Lord Ram will be throned to become a king" "But he will have to go to fulfil his parents wish" "He quits all the glory" "He enjoys the togetherness" Great! "This story of sacrifice is scripted..." "...forever in history" This story of sacrifice is scripted forever in history. Through his poems, he explains the importance of women. A women is a mine of riches. - And Dhruva is like Prahlad. - Wow! Very nice! Thousand years of living without thoughtfulness... ...is worse than living two minutes of thoughtful life. BAABLA: Very nice Sairam. I wanted to tell you the story of my friend Hasmukh today. He never had a smile on his face and he became a living ghost. Today, I am going to tell you about the living ghost Hasmukh. I feel that only unmarried people live a life. Those who are married are as good as dead. (People Laughs) Hasmukh fell in love with a girl called Mandakini. Hashmukh married Mandakini without informing anyone. BAABLA: 'No one knew about his marriage.' 'Mandakini, my father is a very orthodox person.' 'I mean he is very narrow-minded.' 'First we will have to cajole and pacify him.' 'Then I will be able to take you to my home.' 'I promise you.' 'We have been married in the presence of God!' 'But you shall not disclose this to anyone else.' Hasmukh got married to Mandakini. But he was not able to take him home. Because his father had a very bad temper. - 'Dad. - Yes!' - 'I need to talk to you. - Good you came...' '...I need to talk to you since so many days.' 'I keep on forgetting it.' 'I am getting old and am not sure how much more I will live.' 'You will have to give me a promise. You cannot deny.' 'Okay, I promise you.' 'Now you tell me your story.' 'Dad, I am in love with a girl called Mandakini.' 'What?' - 'And we have already.... - What did you do?' 'Nothing. I have not done anything.' 'I just want to marry her.' 'Are you not ashamed?' 'Is this our culture?' 'You have decided to get married even without consulting your father?' 'You should be ashamed of yourself.' 'You will get married to Jayanti's daughter Sridevi.' - 'But father... - I don't want to listen to anything else.' 'Do you know that the entire society was against...' '...me when I had suffered losses in my business.' 'Jayanti had helped me then.' 'Because of him, I was able to survive.' 'Do you even know this? When you were 12- years-old, you had fallen in the well.' 'Jayanti did not think twice and jumped into the well to save you.' 'He hit his head against the steps in the well and died.' 'Sridevi became an orphan.' 'Hence I had promised him on his grave.' 'You do not worry about Sridevi.' 'I will make your daughter, my daughter-in-law.' 'And you want to get married to someone else?' - 'But father I have already... - Look...' '...I will die if you get married to someone of your choice.' 'You will get married to Sridevi only and no one else.' 'Yes!' BAABLA: Some people are not able to find one life partner. And Hasmukh had 2 life partners already. He loved Mandakini and got married to her. And with his father's blessings, he got married to Sridevi. One gets married when luck does not favor him. But when the time is really bad, he gets married twice. Hasmukh got married to Mandakini and made her settle in Baroda. And he got married to Sridevi, due to his father's wish and settled her in Ahmedabad. And Hasmukh was so innocent, he had children... ...with both his wives within a year of marriage. Within 24 years of marriage, he got experience of 84 years. But what a life it was. He got so tired. He was not able to live for himself due to shuffling between his wives. Neither was he able to prosper in his business. And he borrowed money to sustain his business. Listen to me. I never deny a loan to anyone. But I always show them these pictures before I lend the money. Do you want to know who are they? Are these your family members? (Laughs) These are the people who have not returned my money. Don't worry. I do not kill anyone. Then... But such a situation occurs that they have to commit suicide. I have not hired sharp shooters. Then... - I have hired truck drivers. - Truck drivers? - Why? - Whoever defaults the payment... ...is met with an accident. Forget everything else... I will never forget to repay your money. Never. And to escape the labyrinth of the loan... ...Hasmukh made a plan. To escape the shuffling between Mandakini and Sridevi... ...and also to escape the repayment off the money he had borrowed. - What if he dies? - But... He died on paper at one place and he continued to live at the other place. Hasmukh had only one friend. His name was Rajikant. But he was totally different compared to the other Rajnikant. He tried to cry artificially and went to... - ...convey the news to Mandakini. - Sister-in-law! - BAABLA: 'My friend Hasmukh is no more.' - (Indistinct) Sister-in-law. - What happened? - Sister-in-law. Why are you crying? And why am I smelling onion? Let go the smell of the onions, sister-in-law. Sridevi? - Mandakini. - Yes? Hasmukh drowned in the sea and is no more. - What? - Yes. No, it cannot be. - They are unable to find his body. - No. The fishes would have have eaten him up. Hasmukh. PAARTH'S FATHER: How is it possible? Looks like you are talking as a man due to the shock. I am not speaking. It is the person behind you. My name is Bhura Rabari. Your friend Hasmukh had borrowed 5 crore rupees from me. Now you will have to repay that money. Where shall I payback the money? Maybe God give you strength to bear your loss. Hey! "He is confused. He is stuck" (Musical Instruments Playing) - This one is similar to your story. - It is not similar to my story. It is my story. I told him my story a couple of days back. And he is telling my story to everyone. (Indistinct chatters) And he is saying that he has changed the name. He did not even change the name. Then why don't you change your name? How can we change a name of the person who is dead? I had to bluff my death for Mandakini and my son Akash. And your friend Hasmukh Jobanputra is a living ghost now. Don't worry. Be happy. It is your Happy Birthday tomorrow. - It is two-in-one celebration. - What? It is my birthday as well as my death anniversary. (Forcefully chuckles) Mom! Mom! - Mom, where are you? - I am in the kitchen. Take this. I got cake for dad. Wow. Very good. Listen... I have made his favorite dishes for him today. Wow! Let us have a grand celebration on his birthday today. - Akash. - Yes, mom? I have made your father's favorite food today. - Today is his death anniversary. - Yes! Go and offer some food to the crows. This is such a strange coincidence. It is his birthday today and also his death anniversary. - It is all due to the bad deeds. - What? I mean it is someone else's bad deeds and my friend had to suffer because of it. Come on. Let us finish the custom. What are you doing? - Come on. - Why are you pushing me? - It is a surprise. - She is a strange girl. Surprise. Come on. Blow the candles. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear dad. Happy Birthday to you. Crow. - Crow. - Eat. - No. - Crow! Crow! - Eat it. - No. Crow. Crow. - Eat. - No. HASMUKH: No. Crow. (In Hindi) Do you need anything else, madam? Do you want to order anything special? - No. - Okay. No sir, thank you so much. - And please get our food fast. - Okay, madam. - I am very hungry. - They have taken a lot of time to get here. How was my death anniversary? - That guy got scared. - You are a strange man. I hope everything went well at my death anniversary rituals. You are the first person in the world who is able to ask this question. - Will my soul rest in peace? - Idiot! You were celebrating your birthday in Ahmedabad. And I was performing your death anniversary rituals in Baroda. My entire day was wasted to call the crows. Did the crows come come? No, they didn't come this year as well. - Then they will come next year. - You... (Laughs) Come, Rajni. Have a seat. Sit. Sit. Where did... You took a long time, Hasmukh. - There was a big queue. - Where was the queue? - In the washroom. - Oh yes! There was a big queue there. There was a big queue. (Indistinct) - Dad, just the dinner will not suffice. - Then? You will have to give me a return gift on your birthday. I will surely give you. Just ask for it. Give me a promise that you will not deny whatever I ask for. 'You will have to first promise me, that you... - ...will not deny whatever I ask for.' - No! Dear, I had promised someone once and I have repented a lot. - I don't want to repent again. - When? That is an old story. Let's not discuss it now. You tell me, dear. What do you want as a return gift? I want a bike. No, not a bike. - Bike? - Yes. No, dear. Not a bike. - You already have an Activa. - Yes! - But, mom. - No, dear. - Bike is meant for guys and not girls. - Correct. So you think there is a difference between a guy and a girl? That too in this modern world. - Dad! - No, my child. You are more than a son to me. If you had a brother, I would have surely loved you more. I would have spent more time with you than him. Right? Don't I give her more time than a son? - What? - I mean I would have given her more time. (Laughs) - Not a bike. - But, dad. You can ask for anything else. Ask for a car but not a bike. No means no! No means no! Oh No! What is this? This is cheap. Yes, this is Hello. I saw your ad on the bargain portal. Do you want to sell your bike? - AKASH: 'What is your name?' - My name is Sapna Jobanputra. Wow! My name is Akash. Akash Jobanputra. We have the same last name. What is your father's name? Won't you sell your bike if I don't tell my father's name? Just wanted to check whether I know him. His name is Hasmukh Jobanputra. Is this some kind of joke? My father's name was also Hasmukh. What do you mean by "was"? Has he changed the name? (Tongue Clicking) It is not a bad name. No, he did not change his name. He changed his world. He is no more. - I am sorry. - It's okay. You like my bike, isn't it? Let us meet up in a day or two. But I am from Ahmedabad. So you will have to get your bike here. Yes! Why not? I will be there. Okay, I will let you know when to come. I will save your number. - Bye. - Bye. Sapna Jobanputra. (Burps) - Akash, your tea is getting cold. - AKASH: Yes. - You have made awesome tea. - Thank you. Mom, uncle Rajni, a strange thing happened today. What happened? Remember that advertisement I had published to sell my bike. - Yes. - A girl from Ahmedabad called me. - And guess what was her name. - What? Sapna Hasmukhlal Jobanputra. What happened, Rajni? You were saying that the tea was very nice. The tea is indeed very good. But it does not seem to be a good day. - I will have to go. - But the washroom is over there. I have another important work. - Hey... - Isn't this strange, mom? - Phone! Phone! - What happened now? I forgot my phone. He is a strange man. - Why are you pulling me? - You come this side. What happened? What is your problem? - You are going to be in trouble. - What? - You are going to get exposed. - Don't worry about me. - You think this is a joke? - What happened? Akash and Sapna are going to meet. - What? - Yes. Now you know what was I talking about? But how is this possible? How do they know each other? - All because of Sapna. - What did she do? Sapna was searching online for a second-hand bike. - And she saw Akash's advertisement for the bike. - This is crazy! - Why are you so worried? - Tension. - What shall we do now? - Why are you asking me? I know, pal! I think I will get a heart attack. Oh my God! (Sobbing) I should have given her the bike that day. What to do now? I will have to do something. I will have to do some chicanery. (Background Music) - Idea! - What? Let us treat the trouble at the source, to avoid a bigger mess. I think you are getting yourself in more trouble. You use my brain to think about this. What if there is no bike? - What will Akash sell then? - What? Let the bike go missing. - What do you mean? - I mean missing. I have the duplicate key of that house. We will get in the house and steal the bike. - Are you out of your mind? - This is a good plan. What if we are caught? Is anything written on my forehead? What are you trying to read, dumb head? I have been managing 2 houses since the last 24 years. You could not marry due to that, but was I ever caught? You do not talk about my marriage. You worry about your problem. Don't worry. Everything is planned out. You just follow me. Follow me. (Cow Mooing) (Clatters) Why is this bullock here at this time? I think it is hungry. Do you want something to eat? (Indistinct) You seem to be understanding my language. Come in. Come in. Help me! God! "Oh Lord, we are your devotees." Help me. Help me. Help me. Someone help me. (Indistinct) I am going to see Manda. I have not seen them since a long time. - I just want to see them once. - Okay, go! Are you out of your mind? Hasmukh, what is this? You have come to steal in your own house? Who is there? It is my favorite chair. I used to always sit on it. - Let me sit on it once. Just once. - Go! Go and sit. Manda... - I am sorry, Manda. - How long will you sit here? Come on. I am sorry, Manda. (Indistinct) - "My white wrists are yours baby" - What are you doing? - I didn't... - Leave the remote! (Song Playing) - Let us get away fast. - Wait, wait! How come chair is rocking? (Intense Background Music) Who's it? (Echoes) Who's it? (Dog Barking At Distance) Manda! Hey, Manda. - Listen. - AKASH: Mom. AKASH: Mom. Hasmukh, come here. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! - Mom, what happened? - Ghost! Ghost! - Your father's ghost. - What? - Your father's ghost. - There is nothing like that. - There was a ghost. Your father's ghost. - There wasn't anything. Hasmukh, Mandakini has mistaken you for a ghost. If we see a dead person we will obviously think it is a ghost. Now what? Get the bike fast. That drunk watchman will wake up. Let's go. - (Cow Mooing) - Oh Lord! Come let's go. What are you doing? The gate's open! Come. Let's go. Fast. He will see us. Is this an ox or a bike? (Cow Mooing) Who is it? Who is it? Everyone is saying that my father's ghost has stolen the bike. But how can a ghost steal a bike? I also feel the same. Okay will talk with you later. Mandakini, what happened? Why did you call me here? Rajni, you came so late. - I just left in the middle of the night. - What? - What? - I was unwell in the middle of the night. I took some medicine and went to sleep. - What happened? - Yesterday, we saw Hasmukh's ghost. And his ghost stole Akash's bike. Sometime I also see Hasmukh's ghost. - Do you know what does this mean? - What? It means his spirit is still around. I think his desire is incomplete. But he has fulfilled all his wishes twice. No, if the desire is incomplete, the soul will be around. We have to perform some rituals for his soul to rest in peace. We will have to call the occultist. - Solid. - What? Solid idea came to my mind. She will call an occultist to perform some rituals. So I will go there as a ghost. And I will make an announcement. Akash you should not meet Sapna, not even in your dreams. Wonderful. Tell Mandakini conduct the rituals. OCCULTIST: Play the drums. "I am playing the drums" Stop! Priest, my father's soul will come, won't it? It will surely come. It is my achievement. When I call, even the difficult spirits have come. His spirit will also come. (Cellphone Ringing) - Switch off your phone. - Okay. - Everyone switch off their phones. - Switch it off. - Your phone is still on. - What? - How did he know? - He is a great man. If the ghost comes, don't be afraid of him. - You also don't be afraid if he comes, priest. - You... I am not afraid of ghosts. I have seen a lot of ghosts. - What is the name? - Rajnikant. Rajnikant, come here. - I am already here. - What is the client's name? Her name is Mandakini. Mandakini, come here. She is already here. - Then whose ghost are we calling? - Mr. Hasmukh's. Play the drum. "Come you ghost" "Come you ghost" Stop. Hasmukh, listen to me. Your wife, son, friend and watchman... ...have conducted this ceremony for your soul to rest in peace. And you should not make any fuss. (Cellphone Ringing) - I have told you all to switch off the phones. - It is already switched off. - Then why is it ringing? - I don't know. Hey... 'Hello everybody.' - Mom. - Who is he? Can't you see? This is his soul. - My husband. - Hasmukh. - Run everybody. - Listen. (Indistinct Chatters) We have done so many rituals, but a soul has never come. How did it come today? - Let me go. - Where are you going? - How shall we send him back? - Hey... This is his house. Let him decide. He can come and go whenever he wishes. Run. - OCCULTIST: There is a ghost. - Priest... - You are finally here. - 'Yes, Manda.' He disappeared. I am here. (Echoing) Don't touch him. His soul will disappear. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. How are you? How's your health? A soul does not have any form, any odour or any shape. The soul only has an incomplete desire. I felt that your wish was incomplete. - Which desire is incomplete? - My wish to get married. You still want to get married? I don't want to get married. I want someone else to get married. Whose marriage? Mine? What nonsense! Not you. I want Akash to get married. (Gasps) Your marriage. But father, I don't want to get married now. I am still young and want to have fun. You will regret in the end, with all this fun. Don't fool with me. I know everything. I know where you go. I know what you do. I know the girls you talk to. Dad, how do you know all this? I am your father. And on top of that I am a ghost as well. I am Father ghost. Look! Nowadays you are talking to girl named Sapna Jobanputra? Yes. I just spoke to her. - And we are going to meet soon. - Don't meet her. - Why? - Don't even try to meet that girl. - But why? - Listen, Manda. If he tries to meet Sapna, misery will strike this house. Did you see? And don't even think about meeting Sapna even in your next birth. - Understood? - But why? Block the phone number of that girl. - But, mom... - Just block it. HASMUKH: Block her number. Repeat after me. She is your sister. - She is your sister. - Not mine. Yours. Okay, mine. Manda, I am worried a lot for him. Keep an eye on him. Take care of him. - I'll leave. - Listen. What? - Promise me. - What? - Don't say no. - Tell me. Keep on coming to our home. - I miss you. - No, Manda. It is very difficult to come down from heaven. Do you want me to roam around like a ghost? No. - No, right? - Yes! Then pray for my soul to rest peace, Manda. Just pray. You have to close your eyes and pray, Manda. - You are back? - I don't want it. You don't want to have breakfast? Then have some juice. I don't want, mom. Is there some problem? Did your phone break? - No, dad. - Then, what is it? You know about that Akash Jobanputra, who had agreed to sell his bike. Yes. We were going to meet. - Now he isn't picking up his phone. - Then forget about him. It is his bike. He wants to sell it. He should call you instead. Buyers are always God. Aren't they, Sridevi? - Yeah. Right. - Then? It is his bike. He wants to sell it. He should call. - Why are you worrying so much? - Then what? - I think dad is right. - Isn't it? But I am going to get that bike anyhow. (Rhythmic Whistling) Why are you smiling like this? I am very relaxed since the morning. - Really. Listen, Sridevi. - Yes! Please make some sweet for lunch. - Sweet? - Dad. - I am going to Baroda. - What? - Cancel the sweet. - What? Why do you want to go to Baroda? She wants to go to Baroda to meet a stranger. What is it Hasmukh? I feel something fishy. Initially, Akash Jobanputra wanted to sell the bike. Yes. And then he told me that the bike was stolen by his father's ghost. - Nonsense. - And now he is not picking up his phone. I am sure something is wrong. I have to go to Baroda. Why do you want to go to Baroda? Why does she want to go to Baroda? How can she go to Baroda by herself? Alone? He has not seen that guy. She does not know him. How can she go to Baroda alone? Why aren't you saying anything to her? Listen, dear. Your dad is right. We don't know the person. We have not met him. How can you go to Baroda to meet such a person? And that too alone? No! I will come with you. What? What is there in Baroda? Why will you go there? Is someone getting married there and you want to dance? Relax. That is what I am saying. Relax. Relax. Give him some time. That boy will call. May be after a couple of days. His phone could have been broken. He may have fallen sick. That can be possible, isn't it? It might take few days to get repaired. Be it a phone or a person. Give him at least a couple of days to solve the problem. Shouldn't we give him some time? So, relax. Okay? RAJNIKANT: My God! How will you explain Sapna? Normally a daughter is like a cow... - ...but your daughter is like a tigress. - That is the problem. It is like I am turning the steering to the right, but the car is going to the left. If I stitch my shirt, my trouser gets torn. This is how my condition is. (Gasps) If Sapna meets Akash, I will die for sure. - We will get to eat some sweets if you die. - No. Not so early. We need to do a chicanery again. - Once more? - Yes. If someone mimics Shah Rukh Khan in front of... ...a blind man what will the blind man feel? He will feel Shah Rukh Khan is in front of him. - Correct. - But where does Shah Rukh fit in all this? Try to understand the feeling of the story. Has Sapna seen Akash? - No. - Then the issue is solved. The guy who will meet Sapna as Akash, see will... ...definitely think that he is Akash, right? - Tell me what should we do? - Simple. All you have to do is find a boy who will disguise as Akash and meet Sapna. He will fight with him and this chapter will be closed. Understood? - World best idea. - Isn't it? Yes, it is. Isn't it? CHANDNI: Hey rickshaw, wait. (Indistinct) Oh God! That drunkard lady is back again. Parth, don't come outside. - What happened? - Go in again. Go! - Chandni. - Parth Parth! Come, Miss Chandni. What happened? Parth, please give me 5000 rupees. What? I will return it later. No, Parth. Don't give her the money. You know that Chandni spends all her money in drinking. Hey, stupid. Shut up. Actually I am offered a Gujarati film. - Really? Wow. - Yes. So I wanted to do some shopping, please. - I see. - Give me, please. Okay. Okay. No problem. Get those five thousand rupees. - And give it to her. - Are you crazy, Parth? Give her. Are you mad? We have to pay two months' rent to Mukesh today. Don't you understand? Shall we work on the road? I am there. I will take care of everything. Don't take any tension. Chandni is like our sister. It is our duty to help her. Understood? Now go. We don't have anything to eat and he wants to give it to everyone. PARTH: He is crazy. (Laughs) - Give me. - Take it. - First promise me that you will not spend the money in drinking. - Yes. - Promise? - Yes. Bye! - Bye. - Bye. - All the best. - CHANDNI: Thank you bro. - Parth, how shall we handle Mr. Mukesh? - I will take care of him. - You go and work. - Talk calmly. Come, Rajni uncle. What needs to be repaired? - Him. - What? I mean he has some work. - There is nothing to repair. - Then? We want to break something. - What? - I will explain you. He is my friend Mr. Hasmukh Jobanputra. - And he is Parth. - Oh, I see. You have to disguise as Akash Jobanputra and meet his daughter. What kind of a father are you? You are trying to set up your own daughter. Shame on you. - Mind your language. - Hey. Why are you getting angry? It's just a small thing. And I will pay you for this. You don't have to do it for free. You have to meet my daughter Sapna as Akash Jobanputra. And when you meet her, you have to fight with her. So my daughter will not think of Akash Jobanputra in her entire life. - It means that Akash needs to get away from her life. - Yes. I understood. I need to create hatred for Akash Jobanputra. - Right? - Yes. - Right? - Yes. Right? Oh okay! I will give it. This is 40 rupees. I will give rest of the money after the work. Wow! - We can give this money to Mr. Mukesh. - Hey you, listen! I do not want any issues in the work. Whatever work Parth does, always has some issues. There is no one who can say that. - Oh! - Give me your daughter's number. - Wait, I will give it. - I have already sent it to you. This is known as Rajnikant speed. I will call her right away. - Hi Sapna, how are you? - Who is this? You forgot me already? I am Akash. 'Akash? The guy with the bike?' - Akash, the guy with the bike? - Yes. Of course, the guy with the bike. - Actually I changed my number. - And your voice too changed? Initially my voice was different and now it is different. It will be all fine after I meet you. - Should we meet today? - Where? In Baroda? Why should we go to Baroda? Let us meet here in Ahemdabad. - He is from Baroda. - I mean I am in Ahmedabad today. 'Where in Ahmedabad?' 'YMCA?' - YMCA? - Yes! - I'll pay you. Say yes. - Okay done. - PARTH: Where is she? - HASMUKH: Come here. - Do you see that girl in the red t-shirt? - Yes. She is my daughter. You have to meet her. Okay. - All the best. - Thank you. (Music Playing) Hi. Sapna? - Akash? - Jobanputra. - Hi. - You... - Chill. - Orthodox. Disgusting. So? What was your problem? I called you so many times. Your phone was unavailable. How do I explain it? I got so frustrated. I have been getting calls from so many girls. - I got frustrated and changed my number. - Oh! - That means you have girlfriends as well? - Obviously. If you see my Facebook account, you will wonder why do I have so many requests. So I wanted to throw away the old girls and try something with new girls. - Try? - Try. Just enjoying life. Whatever. So you want to sell your bike? - I do. But who will buy it? - I will. - You? - Yes. What? (Laughs) You will ride a bike? - She wants to ride a bike. - What is the problem in it? Either do skipping or play with a doll. Play with kitchen set. Listen, don't be over smart. Talk to me if you want to sell your bike. Otherwise I don't have time. Bye. The fight is done. He is following her. Why is he following her? Sister, I am hungry. Give me some food or some money. One minute. Don't give him money. - Child. - Yes. Why are you begging? Do not beg. So should I die of hunger? You are telling me not to beg. Government says that children cannot work. Parents do not earn. Should I starve to death? You have to study. I shall admit you in a good government school. If you study in the government school, they will give you food. All the government schools provide mid-day meals. They give food only once, isn't it? I get hungry twice. So I'll admit you in two schools. Just keep on studying. - Okay? - Yes. - So, so you chew tobacco? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. PARTH: Don't even eat it. - Give me a promise. - Promise. Thank you, big brother. You gave me a very good advice. Now you may go. (Laughs) Sorry, I got angry earlier. I am sorry. I made you upset. It's okay. By the way, I liked it. The way you explained it to the boy. - And I like you. - What? Yes, I don't know how to hide things. I told you what was in my mind. I fell in love with you at the first sight. If you want I won't use Facebook. I shall not use Whatsapp after 10 pm. I don't like Instagram. And I will delete Snapchat. What say? (Laughs) Please, say something. Why are you laughing? What happened? You are unique. - Even I like you. - Really? - Love at first sight. - Really? I wanted to solve one issue and now there is a bigger issue.

"Hey, item" "Item" Deepak, you may leave now. Tell the customers to come on Monday. Today is Saturday and I will not see them. - Jigar, I am telling you as well. - But, why sir? Why are you worried? I will no deduct it from your salary. Go! Hey you, what do you think of yourself? You are trying to make my daughter fall in love with you. We asked you to fight with her. I am really sorry, but I can't work for you. Here, take your money. Hey you, stay in your limits. And don't even think of getting married to Sapna. Understood? Tell me, how much money you want, to stay away from my daughter? How much money? Honestly, I don't want anything. All I want is your hand. Till now you were asking for Sapna's hand and now you want Hasmukh's hand. Are you going to repair a car with his hand? I want his hand for blessings. Because I am going to marry Sapna. - Look at his confidence. - He is a rascal and a rogue. He knows everything. That I have only one daughter. So he will trap her, marry her and take all my money and property. Tell me, how much money you want to stay away from my daughter? - Tell me, how much money do you want? - Stop it. Money. Money. Money. I have seen a lot of money. But I have never seen love earlier. And that is why I am so stubborn. No one other than Sapna will be able to stop me now. Not even you. And I am going to marry Sapna. Why did you make me meet such a person? I told him to break everything. Instead he fixed his own car. (Cellphone Ringing) It is Mandakini's call. - Yes? - We are going to see a bride for Akash. - Would you like to join? - No. Actually we are in Ahmedabad. I mean I am in Ahmedabad. You go and meet the girl and then tell me how she was. - Okay. - Yes. What is it? Mandakini is going to see a bride for Akash. Okay. First, I will need to worry about him. (Laughs) There is one thing I need to tell you before we finalize this marriage. - My husband has passed away. - Okay. So we have to get you married before them? No, no. What nonsense? I just want to say that the ghost of Akash's father keeps visiting our house. Yes! - What? Akash? - Don't worry. My father's ghost is very cute. - He doesn't trouble anyone. Isn't it, mom? - Yes. - But... - Don't worry my child. There is no such thing as ghost. And all these ghost talks. There is always some or the other problem. But you don't worry. I have taken care of many such ghosts. I mean I have caught people who act of being ghosts. The idea of ghost is just stupid. - My husband's ghost actually comes to our home. - Yes! - Whenever we call him, it arrives. - Yes. - Really? - Yes. Then I would really like to meet him. I would love to meet the ghost of my daughter's father-in-law. But I am not sure whether the ghost be happy after meeting me. (Laughs) Akash. You're too much. SAPNA: Brother. - (Sapna Laughs) - (Dialing) No. - Hasmukh. - Yes? Hasmukh, look. Sapna seems to be so happy. - Since the day Akash has come in her life. She seems to be very happy. - Really! Mom and dad are here. Akash is greeting you. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Tell me. Hasmukh. I suggest that we should get Sapna married to Akash if she likes him so much. Right? We definitely should do that. But honestly, I am worried. Why are you worried? I am her father. It is obvious that I will be worried. But tell me, why are you worried? Why are you getting angry? My heartbeat increases. Don't shout like this. We have pampered our daughter. Have you ever seen her upset? Since her childhood, we have fulfilled all her wishes. If Sapna marries Akash... ...will he be able to fulfill all her wishes? You think about it. Don't tell me anything. Ask yourself. Yes. - Sapna. - I will call you in a while. Yes, mom? Have you ever asked Akash about what he does and how much does he earn? What nonsense, mom? I haven't asked anything like this. - Did you see that? - Yes. - Isn't is obvious that I get worried? - Yes. She will fall in love, marry and leave. What if something happens after that? There are so many divorce cases nowadays. Don't we see them? If I ask anything then it's a sin. That's a problem. - It is better that a mother handles such sensitive problems. - Correct. - Sapna. - Yes! When a daughter gets married, all the parents are... ...worried about how well the guy is doing financially. So you will have to ask Akash about his bank balance today itself. Come on, mom! I cannot ask about the bank balance directly. - You are right. - Then what! - Sridevi. - What? Remember that gift uncle Shanti got from Spain. The one which we haven't used yet. Is it in the bedroom or in the drawer? - Sapna. - I found it. You ask for a very expensive gift from Akash. We will judge his bank balance according to his gift. And how much he loves you. Good idea. I will ask for something. An expensive gift. Thanks, mom. SAPNA: Yes! Now we will see what gift he gets. (Traffic Ambience) (Humming) Hi! Hi. - I had seen you outside. - Silly! Oh no. - Guess what did I get for you. - What? Show it to me. A rose. - A rose? - A rose. I am not interested in a rose. I knew it. I knew that you wouldn't be interested in the rose because you are not a bee. Akash? Tell me, what do you want? I will buy it for you. - Promise? - Yes. - Baby! - Yeah, baby. Baby you love me? A lot. So will you fulfill all my wishes? - Nope. - What? - Have I ever said no to you? - How sweet! So baby. - Yeah? - Get me a bike. Okay, so you like to sing? - What? - You want a mike, right? I don't want a mike. I want a bike. - Bike? - Bike. Oh man! I should have taken the Reliance portfolio. Oh no. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes, go ahead. Why is Sensex called sen...sex? Because it keeps on getting up and down. Oh, I see! Hasmukh, keep your work aside. Look outside. It is pouring love out there. - Pouring love? - Yes. We had asked Akash to get a gift just like that. - He actually got a bike. - What? Come on. Hurry up and see. - How did he get a bike? - I don't know. (Background Music Overlaps Dialogue) I have seen this bike somewhere. You fool. This is the bike which we had stolen. How did he get it? Mandakini is here. Dad. Look at this. Akash's gift. This is the same bike which I liked. Isn't it awesome? How is it? Did you like it or not? Wow! Lovely! - Hasmukh, the bike is really nice, isn't it? - Yes. - Now can we get married? - No. - Why not? - Why? Marriage is not only between two people. It is between two families. Why don't you tell them that are you both going to run away and get married? No, isn't it? So we should meet his family, right? - Shouldn't we meet his parents? - Right. - Tell them this. - Your dad is absolutely right. It is important for both the families to meet before the wedding. - Now quickly fix a meeting with your parents. - Yes. Mom, Akash's father has passed away. Yes! - Oh my God! I am so sorry. - It's okay. But don't worry Akash. Hasmukh is like your father, isn't he? - Yes, Akash is my son. - Didn't I tell you? But we can meet your mother at least. I hope you mother is alive. No. I mean yes. My mother is alive. - But she is out of town. - Out of town? Yes, out of town. - Where has she gone? - Where has she gone? - I'll tell you. - Yes. Where did we go recently? - Where? - Tell me. - Where? - No, you were not there. - Who was she? - Can I answer your dad first? Yes, tell me. Chanod. - Chanod? - Mom has gone to Chanod. Why has she gone to Chanod? You are asking too many questions. Why would a person go to Chanod? - To worship the God? - Yes, to worship the God. But we have to get you married. So let's go over to your house and wait for her. - No no. - Yes. Very nice idea. Let's go to your house and give your mother a surprise. Listen to me first. Why should we wait for anyone in a good cause? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Sapna, please listen to me. - (Indistinct Chatters) Let's go and meet your mom. Let's go. You know the way to your house, don't you? Then take us there. - Let's go. - I am coming. Let's go. Where is Rajnikant? Rajni. Hey, Rajni. - He can't listen. - Come here. In this car. You fool. Come in this car. Is the car going to fly? And he wants to get married. - What are you saying? - Who would marry this fool? Come fast. Why are you just roaming in the lanes of Ahmedabad? Are you taking us for sightseeing? We have already seen Ahmedabad. - Looks like he has forgotten his address. - Uncle Rajni. We will not be able to reach his house today. Go to sleep. Everyone can sleep. Please, wake us up when we reach your house. - What are you saying? - But look at him. - He is just roaming here. - One second. Let me handle. Akash, what are you doing? Where are you taking us? Wherever we go, construction work for metro is going on. The streets are dug up everywhere How shall a person travel? He's right. Let's go tomorrow. - No, no! - No, no! - We will go there today itself. - Yes, today itself. Tomorrow is Sunday. I have an urgent meeting tomorrow. Let us go today. There is no time like the present. (Indistinct) Wake me up when we reach your house. I am going to sleep. You can also sleep. - Okay! - You drive the car. Dad is too much! Dad. - Akash, have we reached your house? - I don't know. Baby, how long will it take? Just three more minutes. Wow! This is a posh area. - Did you think that I am a middle-class person? - No. Wow! Dad, mom. Look at Akash's house. Dad, just look at Akash's house. - Wake up! Mom, let's go and meet my mother-in-law. - Yes. Let's go. Wow, finally we are here. - What? This is... - HASMUKHLAL JOBANPUTRA Wow! Isn't it pretty? Wow. You drove the car very well. (Blabbers) Where have you brought us? "Exchanges and manipulations" "Exchanges and manipulations" How are you, sir? I am fine. How are you? I am fine. - Is mom there? - Yes, she is there. Inform her that guests have come to meet her. - Okay. - You scoundrel. How did you like the house? You brought me to my own house and asking me this? I will kill you. Get out of here. Wait. Mom must be coming. She will feel nice. I will kill you. I will strangle you. Rajnikant. Rajnikant. - Put the car in gear. - This car is automatic. - Guests? - Please, come. - Let's go inside before your mother-in-law comes out. - Yes, yes! You fool. I will get caught because of you. I am sorry, Manda. I am sorry. I am sorry, Manda. Man... What happened? - Aunt Manju passed away. - What? Who is aunt Manju? What do you have to do about it? You come and sit inside the car. Come inside fast. Her last rituals are going to happen soon. Fast. Let us get out of here fast. - Let's go. - Yes, come on. Dad. Why are you going in the trunk? - Dad. - Sir, come inside. SAPNA: Get back. SAPNA: Dad? Let us leave fast. What are you doing? - Madam. - Where are the guests? Dad, get out of the trunk. Madam, look there. "Manipulations everywhere" "Exchanges and manipulations" "Exchanges and manipulations" "Exchanges and manipulations" This is fantastic. We went all the way to Baroda. But we couldn't meet Akash's mom. - You did not do this right. - Why did you do this, dad? I could have seen my mother-in-law. Why don't you understand? It is bad luck if my daughter steps in that house before marriage. What nonsense! That is the reason we came back. It means that you have accepted Akash as your son-in-law? - Congratulations. - Mom, I am so happy. Don't act smart. Will you guys separate out or continue to celebrate till evening? Son-in-law has come. It is bad luck if he leaves today without eating. Make some sweet dish for him. - Go fast. - The shopping list... Be careful! Put some cow's clarified butter in the sweet dish. It is auspicious. Let me help them. I am very good at making sweet dish. And I am very good at beating someone. Come! Rascal, how did you know about my two weddings? - Who told you? - Uncle Rajnikant told me about it. - What did you tell him? - Let me tell you. What? Where did you park the bike which was stolen by the ghost? - In my garage. - Correct! Then I got the papers from it. And guess whose name it had? Who's name? - Akash Hasmukhlal Jobanputra. - Correct. Then I realized that there is major problem. - So I went to Baroda. - Wow! You fool. You have shared everything with him. - Sorry, sory! What happened after that? - What after that? Then I met your watchman. I started talking to him. He told me everything. The manipulation that you have done by getting married twice is amazing. I salute your family planning. - This are not called family planning. - Then? It is called expanding the family. Two wives. What a life! What a life. Come here. I request you. I beg you. Please, don't share this secret with anyone. I request you. You are elder to me. Please, do not beg. - Please. - Give me your blessings. When will you get me engaged to you daughter? Please, try to understand the pity situation of a father. Try to understand the sadness of a father. I have pampered my daughter so much since her childhood. How can I marry her with a mechanic? What will she do? - How can I marry her to you? - You are taking unnecessary tension. I am not a mechanic. I am a rich man. Every donkey thinks likes that. That we are a horse, giraffe or an elephant. All the donkeys feel like that. But he is always a donkey. Look at me. I feel I am Varun Dhawan. But I am Alok Nath. I am not kidding. I have fought with my parents. That's why I have left my house for a few days. My father is a millionaire. (Cellphone Ringing) - Really? - Yes. Who is your father? - Its Mandakini. - Hey, don't joke. My God! I hope she has not seen us. I'm not sure. I will tell her that we aren't together. Don't tell her anything you fool. According to her, I am dead. Stupid. Pick up the phone. Yes, Mandakini. - Talk slowly! - MANDAKINI: 'Hello.' - Yes? - 'Rajni.' Yes. - Switch on the TV. - Why? The girl whom we had finalized for Akash. Her dad is on the television. - What are you saying? - Yes, just switch on the TV. Yes, yes! - Okay. - What happened? Your son's father-in-law is a famous person. He is on the TV now. I don't understand what are you talking about. Let's go and watch this film. You stay here. Please. I beg you. Please, don't tell about this Baroda incident to anyone. 'Dr. KD. Doctor, we have heard a lot about you.' 'You have helped many patients.' 'And you have also found a solution to many brain related problems.' Oh, so he is my son's father-in-law. Doctor, Psychiatrist. Wow. That's nice. - My daughter-in-law belongs to a good family. - But he is bald man. Is Akash going to marry him? His daughter won't be bald. She must be having hair, right? You watch the news. 'There is an interesting thing behind this.' 'Even though I am a doctor, I was approached with...' '...cases of witches, ghosts, black magic and many more.' 'Which is why...' '...I left my practice and decided,' 'to eradicate such superstition from the entire Gujarat.' 'I made up my mind and left.' His practise must not be doing well. Hence he decided to have this mission. And gave it a nice name. Remove superstition. He is a black magician who wears a tie. Be careful. He is my son's father-in-law. 'We have heard you also catch ghosts?' - This bald man catches ghosts. - Hey, don't scare me. Listen quietly. 'There is no such thing as ghosts.' 'But there are people who disguise as ghosts.' 'So what I'm saying...' '...there is a female ghost who is wandering in a big house.' 'I went over there after hearing this.' 'When I went there, I saw that many goons wanted to usurp the bungalow.' 'So the hired an actress and asked her to act like a ghost.' - 'What are you saying? - I exposed them.' 'Oh!' 'There is always a fraud person behind every real ghost story.' 'How do you catch these ghosts?' 'There are different techniques for doing that.' 'I have put chilli powder in the eyes of many ghosts.' 'Sometimes I use fire.' 'The ghost panics and runs helter skelter.' 'I love to catch such fake ghosts.' 'Wow!' (Crickets Chirping) My head is going to blast. Oh God! I became a live ghost so that my daughter would not meet my son. And my son's father-in-law is an enemy of the ghost. Don't even go in front of Dr. KD by mistake. Or else he will expose you. You will not be able to tell anyone nor be able to bear the pain. That crazy person puts chilli powder in the eyes of ghosts. He puts them on fire. Shouldn't ghosts be treated with humanity? If Dr. KD exposes you... ...then Mandakini and Sridevi will beat you so much that you become a real ghost. Shut up. Please, don't speak nonsense. There is already a problem of that guy with the garage. He was saying his father is a millionaire. - What will be his business? - He is just lying. He does not seem to be so rich. I won't let him step inside my house. You just wait and watch. SRIDEVI: Hasmukh. - What is it? - Hey listen... Now what do you want? Call Akash and tell him to come here with his mother. We need to talk about the marriage plans. There is no need to have him step inside this house. - He is not a rich person. - You talking nonsense. He is a millionaire. He is my son-in-law. Sapna, you call Akash and tell him... ...to get his mother here and meet us. - Really? - Yes, dear. I love you, dad. Even you may go. Tell her to call him and get his mother tomorrow. And ask her not to talk too much with him and... ...not go out with him before the marriage. - Okay, I will tell her. - Okay. Go. What an amazing person! It is indeed an amazing idea, you fool! Only your name is Rajnikant, but I am the real hero here. Come here. Come here. Come here. This fake Akash won't be able to get his mother here. Oh man. And if he gets his real mother then he will be exposed. Don't take tension. His game will be over. (Laughs) - My mom always used to say this. - What? If you do good with others then good will happen to you as well. You go to help people in their worst times. So someone will come to help you in your bad time. - Who will come? - Idea. - His phone is switched off. - He is a strange man. Let's see how he gets his mother here today. - He was supposed to come at 9 o'clock. - Its 10 already. And you have an urgent meeting at 11 o'clock. - Please, reach on time. - I don't care about that meeting. You don't have to reach on time for such meetings. If you reach on time, then they don't value you. We should always reach late. Only then will people value you. Remember this your entire life. It is 10 am already but Akash and his mother are still not here. This is what I don't like. The person who doesn't value time can never be trusted. Remember this all your life. You are absolutely correct. - Such small things helps to judge the character of a person. - Mom. Dear, this is about your marriage. Such things cannot be ignored. Yes, dear! She is right. He is making us wait for so long. - Yes! - I am still asking to forget this guy. - I am here. - Akash. - You have come. But where is your mother? - She is here. - Where? - I will call her. Mom. I hope he hasn't brought Mandakini. Don't scare me like this. I can't guarantee him. He may get Mandakini from Baroda. Come on. (Background Music) She is gorgeous. Mom. Mom! Greetings. Mom. These are my in-laws. - They are your in-laws? - Yes. Come inside. Mother-in-law? Where is she? Oh God! What happened to her? What is she doing? - This is her way of greeting. - Greetings! Please, don't do this. No, no! Please, don't do this. What are you doing? We are the parents of the daughter. We should take your blessings. - You should not do this. - Yes. - These are her values. - Rajeshri. My mom is from a royal family. - Correct. - Princess of Nani Daman. Nani Daman? This is a big thing. Who is sleeping? (Lions Roar) She is snoring. Yes! Has she come here to sleep or talk about the marriage? - Dad. - Mom. - Mom! - Yes, yes! I was awake the entire night. - I was watching a movie. - Future? She was watching the future. Mine and Sapna's future. My daughter is so lucky. Her mother-in-law is so worried for her. What is she drinking? Your mom? Medicine? - Medicine? - Yes. - Mom is taking her medicine. - Medicine. It is given by Nani Daman's royal doctor. - For what? - I will tell you. - Actually, she has a disease of remembering things. - What? It is a rare case. Mom remembers my dad too much. No, mom! No! After his death, she remembers him lot. This medicine is to get rid of those memories. - Parth! - Parth? Tell Parth to keep the arrows ready. Now that we are getting married. Wasn't this that you wanted to tell? She loves Gujarati literature. Really? - She keeps on using such language. - What else does she use? How did you find the girl? - She is amazing. Get married to her. - Hey! - She is the mother. - She is an item. - You mean she is very nice, isn't it, mom? - Yes! And the father is also so cool. - "There is a strange queer in my heart today" - Poem! Wow! (Laughs) "I am singing here in front of your in-laws" "I am singing here" You can continue singing the songs. - I will talk to Akash till then. Come on. - Okay! Who is this beauty? Whom have you disguised as your mother? I know her. She is a bar dancer. Bar... How do you know that she is a bar dancer? Is this why you used to travel to Mumbai? (Laughs) - Is she a bar dancer? - She is not a bar dancer. - Then? - She use to work as a heroine in Hindi movies in her peak time. Now she works in Gujarati movies. I will expose you today for sure. If you expose me, you will be exposed as well. Keep that in mind. Both of you stop fighting like this. I will see you outside tomorrow. I will clear everything. He will be somewhere here. Get aside. - So me and Sapna... - What? - Is everything fixed now? - Are you crazy? Yes, you are! What did you say? You are going to be my father-in-law. I don't want you to act oversmart. Got it? Are you sure he is here? Yes, we are very sure. Then why are you standing here? Let us look for him. Now tell me the truth. Who are your real parents? Let's not talk about them. I have rejected them. - I don't want to hear anything else. - Try and understand me... Oh God! - Why are you so scared? - I'll tell you if I'll be alive. - Here he is. - Father-in-law. Catch them. Don't let them go.

He is a dangerous man. He does not keep revolvers, but truck drivers to kill people. - I know that. He is my father. - What? Run. Dad. Hey... Dad! Dad! COLLECTIVELY: What happened? Parth, my son. Where have you been? - Where did you go? - Dad! Dad! Keep calm. Keep calm. What happened to you? Why did you get unconscious? When I got to know that you are in Ahmedabad, I came to look for you here. Then I looked for you at the hotel but you ran away from there as well. And I came here searching for you. And do you know what did I see? What did you see? - I saw a ghost. - Ghost? Whose ghost? Someone who had borrowed money from me. The ghost of Hashmukh Jobanputra. I had lent him 5 crore rupees. He gave me the interest on the money. But he couldn't give me the principal amount. And he committed suicide by drowning in the sea. Suicide? (Blabbers) Then why did he come here? To take revenge. Sir, we can save you from humans but not from ghosts. - Please, let us go. - Don't leave me alone. Tell him not to leave me. I will explain them. You cannot leave him and go. - You all will have to stand here. - Yes, stand here. I explained them all, dad. - What if he comes to kill me? - No, dad! He won't. Don't be scared. He will not come. He will not come. He will not come. Rajni, let us do one thing. Start this JCB. Put me in it and keep on banging me till I die. Else give me some poison so that I can have it and die. I will get it. But what happened? - You know that money lender? - Yes. I had borrowed 5 crore rupees from him. He is Parth's father. - What are you saying? - Yes! Oh no. Looking at you I am feeling good that I did not get married. Both my childrens' in- laws are so strange. One will kill me if he sees me alive. And the other will kill me if he sees me dead. I don't understand, how will my children get married? Father-in-law. You wanted to meet my father. Come on. You are so strange man. You committed suicide to save yourself from my father? If I would not have committed suicide, he would have killed me anyways. Why are you smiling? Just look at your face. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. I am not like what you think of me. - What? - Yes! Meaning? I do not like this business of my father. Hence I left him and moved away. Then keep me away from him as well, please. I understood that you are a man with high self-esteem. I have accepted you as my son-in-law. I will get my daughter married to you. But there is one condition. - What? - Please, don't call me for your wedding. - What? - Please. I beg of you. He will probably be the first person in the world to put a strange request. PARTH'S FATHER: "Long live Lord Krishna!" PARTH'S FATHER: "I saw lord Krishna in my..." Who are these people in my house? "I saw lord Ranchod in the brinjal, I saw lord Keshav in the cabbage" - "And I saw the God in my..." - Stop everyone. - Get out of my place - Hail Lord Krishna. Hail... Parth, when did you come here? I came here since dad had organised the prayers. Parth's father? - You are singing religious songs? - Yes. I am a changed man now. Yes. I have stopped my business of lending money. Wow! You have become a religious person. He has changed for good. He has become a good man now. He has stopped all his wrong businesses. He is right. I was just running after money till now. But now I want to earn some goodwill. And dad, what about the people you harassed till date? I will give them 5 lakh rupees each. - Wow! - And that Hasmukh... I will give him 25 lakhs. - Oh no! - So that his soul will rest in peace. Superb! Does your husband's ghost come to meet you or is he on a vacation? He has not come here since a long time. I think his soul is now resting in peace. That is good news. Let us decide the marriage date. Uncle, we are not in any hurry. Yes, dad. We are not in a hurry. Since you are in no hurry, hence we are trying to hurry. Greetings, madam. Bhura, you came here after such a long time. I had told him that I cannot give you such a big amount. And now my son is getting married. How shall I pay you? No, sister. I am here to take money. In fact I am here to give you money. I have left those bad businesses. I swear by God. This is your bundle. No wait. This is Ramesh's money. This is for Hasmukh. Take it. Count it properly. It is 25 lakhs. Honestly, your husband's ghost has changed my life. Wow! So you are a good man now? One minute, please. What are you trying to say? - You saw the ghost of Hasmukh Jobanputra? - Yes. Really? Well, in that case, now I want to meet his ghost. - Call him. - What? Call him. I have been working on eradicating such superstitions. I do not agree that there are ghosts. You believe in ghosts? You also believe? If you believe in it, you will have to call it. You will have to give me a guarantee. Please, do not call the ghost. I am scared. I want to get scared. I want to see the ghost. I have told you everything. Now you handle it. I am leaving now. Bhura! This is a fight between my faith and your superstition. Your husband's ghost will have to come here... ...to determine who is right and who is wrong. Else this marriage will not happen. "This is a crazy fix." No, no! I cannot do it at any cost. I cannot go in front of Dr. KD as a ghost. He is a crazy person. What if he puts chilli powder in my eyes? I will lose my eyes. Hasmukh, it's okay if you lose your eyes. And if you don't go, Akash's marriage will be called off. This is a strange fix. But you don't know Mandakini and Sridevi. Both of them are like a tigress. I can deal with KD. But I can't deal with these two tigress. Both of them will beat me like the hero... ...beats the villain in South Indian movies. - You don't know anything. - Father-in-law. You do not worry. I am there. All this is happening because of you. I have to do all this because of you. None of this is happening because of either of us. Everyone's fate is decided there. And yours is a special case. Your fate is special and hence you have to deal with it. - What are you trying to read? - Father-in-law. No tension. We will do some setting. So that Dr. CID... Why will CID interfere in this case? I am sorry. I meant Dr. KD. He should feel that there is indeed a ghost. - How shall we do that? - How shall we do that? You leave everything to me. You just get Dr. KD to the cemetery. That's it. Alive or dead? Come on. (Dog Howling At Distance) The party has come. Be ready everyone. (Background Music) (Hindi Movie Song Playing) Mom, who is singing these songs? I have forgotten to switch off the stereo. - You be with us. - Yes. (Scary Laugh) Now what do we do? Rajni, why did you get us to such a secluded place? The ghost of Akash's father comes to our house as well. Sister-in-law, the occultist told me not to call him home since... ...there is an auspicious occasion. Hey, there is nothing called as ghost. And even if the spirit comes, I will hold him from neck and punch him to the ground. (Scary Sound) - What was that? - I might be just an owl. Occultist! That was not an owl, it was the soul of Kanu. Just like dogs wander in your society late at night... ...similarly ghosts wander at such places. Then why don't I see the ghost of Hasmukh? Tell me. If you want to meet the spirit of someone special... ...then you have to perform special rituals at a special place. Come on, let's look for a special place. - Let's go. - Come on. Come on. - (Mantra Chanting) - (Scary Laugh) Akash! There are so many ghosts all around. Dad, let's go back. Don't be scared. In some time, I will prove that there is nothing called as ghosts. And I will expose everyone. I will get my bag of tools. - Tools? - I told you not to call the ghost. Come out. Akash! (Dog Howling) This is the special place. - Isn't it? - Yes. Everyone has to be inside this circle. If you go out of it, any soul can enter your body. (Screams) I am challenging that soul... ...to enter my body. Dad, what are you saying? Now I am afraid of you. Chandni, put the sipper down and enter. CHANDNI: S for Soul G for Ghost. W is for Witch. S if for Soul. And what is E for? (Scary Laugh) This lady was a nursery teacher. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. She is not a witch. She is an awful actress. - I will expose her. - What are you saying? She is a lady ghost. Be careful with what you are talking. Sorry! Sorry! But I will have to bring out the truth. What are you doing, dad? Look... This is petrol. I will pour it around her. - And I will set her ablaze. - Don't do that, dad. Nothing will happen to her. What should I do? I will set her ablaze. Just wait and watch. (Indistinct) - Don't do that. - What are you doing? - Dad, what are you doing? - You will be sinful. I forbid you to do this. - Don't do that. - No, no, no! No. (Indistinct Shouting) (Indistinct Shouting) Who will put off the fire? HASMUKH: I will put off the fire. This is Akash's father. Look! Where did he go? - Where is Hasmukh? - I am here. Akash's father. - You wanted to meet me? - Yes. Come here. Come here and meet me. Come here. Let's hug each other. Now it will be fun. Now we will get to know whether you are indeed a ghost or not. What are you doing? - Oh... - Keep quiet and don't worry. If he is indeed a ghost, he will not get injured. - I am not going to listen to anyone. - You should not shoot a ghost. I am not going to listen. - Let him shoot. Go ahead and shoot. - I'll shoot him. Akash. Dad! Try one more time. (Grunts) Isn't this magic? I will show you now. All your bullets are with me now. - Why is he not getting hurt? - Did you forget? You had said that ghosts do not get injured. You are working to destroy superstition, aren't you? I can throw these bullets at you. You will also be destroyed. - Should I hit you with the bullets? - No, no, no! I will never do this again. I realize that it is my mistake. I believe that you are a ghost. And always remember one thing. Do not bring disrespect my fellow ghosts. Understood? And don't act smart till your daughter is married to my son. Mandu, it's time for me to leave. Now I will have to leave. Listen! How shall I convey you the marriage date? Mandu, I am everywhere. Don't worry. I will get to know the dates somehow. Okay? And pray for my soul to rest in peace. Everyone close your eyes. Hasmukh! - Give me. - Here you go. - Hello, Jaggu. - Hey... Sorry. Jaggu, I have paid the money for the lights and the sound. This is your money. Full and final. Count it. How was my acting, Jaggu? This is the first time I acted as a ghost. You should observe the character and improvise yourself. Go to such scary places. - (Speaking In Native Language) - Yes, you are right. He is saying in Malayalam that you have given 1000 rupees less. What is all this, Chandni? Parth, what are you doing? Jaggu. Actually our producer has gone away. We are his servants. Please, adjust. It's okay. - But always pray for us. - Yes, sure. - Come on. Let us take a picture. - Yes, come on. Jaggu, those ghosts who had given the passing... ...entry were just amazing. There were so real. Real. Why don't we call them as well? - Yes, yes! - We didn't call them. They were real ghosts. (Song Playing) MANDAKINI: Look the priest has come, just when we thought of him... - Greetings! - Greetings to you. Greetings! - Greetings, madam. - Come and have a seat. Have a seat. Did you come up with a date for marriage? Yes. I have a date for marriage. The 3rd of next month is very auspicious for marriage. Let us finalize it then. I hope you are fine with that date. - Yes, I am fine with any date. - Yes, he is fine with it. I hope his soul rests in peace now. - I am trying to suggest that the dates that you... - Hold on. - Sridevi. - Yes? We have been doing your religious rituals since a long time. That is correct. So I will tell you the truth. The horoscopes of the bride and the groom are matching very nicely. And the 3rd of next month is the best date for marriage. No way, sister-in-law. - 3rd of next month will not work out. - Why? What? You try to understand, my brother. You know our close friends in Baroda? They have also fixed the date of 3rd for their son's marriage. Who is your friend in Baroda? - You know Manda... - Manda... Mandar Bhargav. Is there a marriage in their house? And that too on the 3rd? You may do one thing. You can be there on the 3rd. I am not needed over there. Since it's my daughter's marriage... - ...I will have to be here. - Yes. People go to Paris or Mumbai for shopping. Who goes to Ahmedabad for shopping? Ahmedabad is a much advanced city. The fashions are seen in Ahmedabad first and then in Paris. This is their website. You will get all the imported stuff here. Let us start shopping from tomorrow. PARTH: I need to talk to you about something very important. - Please, don't create any more troubles. - No. I want to tell Sapna the truth. That I am Parth and not Akash. I do not wish to get married by telling lies, please. Have you decided to kill me? - Do you love Sapna? - Yes. - Do you truly love her? - Yes. Then tell the truth after the marriage. Everything will be fine. - But you listen... - You listen to me first. If you tell her everything now... ...then my undeclared account of Baroda will be known to all and I will die. So whatever truth you want to tell her you may share it after the marriage. Okay? Have you heard the story from the Mahabharata? Eve Dharma had lied for the benefit of Pandavas. Don't tell anything unless needed. Let me explain you my Mahabharata. Come. - Uncle, I think it will be fun shopping together. - Yes, it will be fun. Our marriage will be a grand affair. - Sapna, let us go upstairs first. - The international branch is upstairs... Hello. - Sapna, hurry up. - Coming mom. What happened, mom? What are you looking at? I saw your father just now. Didn't I tell you that he is around? - He is somewhere around us. - Did you see him? I have checked you. You may go now. We will come back and meet here after we are done. And do not worry about money. Okay? - Yes, dad. - Go. If you need 1 thing, you may shop for 10 things. Do not worry. I will use all you credit cards. You may all go for shopping. It is time for my drink. - Drink? - Medicine. It's time for her medicine. It is time for her medicine. Uncle Rajnikant, please be with mom. - Take care of her. She gets out of control sometimes. - Yes! Give her the medicines. Let us go. Yes, yes... Why did you come to the mall? And why did you get me here? I need saffron clothes since I have renunciated this world. And one of my creditors shop is around here. I have to give him his money. Why should you give him the money? - So that Hasmukh's soul may rest in peace. - Oh God! What? - What I'm saying, that... - Yes, please. Why don't you continue with your shopping and we will do our shopping? - Why, dad? - Because I'm saying it. That's fine. We will save some time as well. Come on, son. Come. - You may shop from wherever you want. Don't worry. - Okay. Hasmukh, we need to complete the shopping today. Don't keep anything on tomorrow. Yes... Let us go this way. All the nice shops are this way. Let us go that way. We will get some nice things over here. What are you doing, Akash? Are you going to wear such clothes in marriage? We will have to impress people. Such clothes! Are you out of your mind? Just see where did you get us. Shut up. We will have to wear good clothes inside. Look... - Father! - Don't worry my, child. What happened? - Your father is not going to come back. - Have a look Akash. - What happened to him? Tell me. - He is missing his dad hence he is crying. Since the day of the marriage is around the corner. Why do you want to have such clothes at this age? Just see how much a man is loving another man. And you just love money. Don't be after the material world. Let's go. - PARTH: Has he gone? - HASMUKH: Gone... - Where has he gone? - That way... Gone! Finally he has stopped crying. Come on, let's go in some other shop. - You can shop from here if you want. - Hasmukh. Sorry. PARTH'S FATHER: This is what I do the entire day. Let's go this way. Hasmukh, you play the piano very nicely. - What happened, dad? Come on. - See your father-in-law plays the piano so nicely. It is programmed. - What? - It is programmed. Please, do not talk about ghosts here. - Let's go. - Come on. Sridevi, finish the entire marriage shopping today. For the regular shopping, we have the whole life. Hurry up! Why are you shouting? I am standing right behind you. This sound? Hey, this sound... - I heard the sound of your father-in-law's ghost. - Dad, please. - Don't talk about the ghost now. - No. I think it is your imagination. No, I really heard it. Do you remember when... I had married you, for the first time... What are you doing? (Imitating Bike Sound) You are looking good with the helmet. - We will buy a bike. - No bike... Come on, run! Let's go this way. This is my helmet. - Is it yours? Are you married? - Yes. - Have you been married recently? - Yes. Do one thing. - Then wear it at home as well. For your safety. - Helmet? - For your safety. - Helmet? You are thinking something different. Go now. We will have to leave from here. Find Chandni and Rajnikanth fast. - Yes, uncle. - Come on, fast. - CHANDNI: Should I give this to her? - RAJNIKANT: Yes! - CHANDNI: That one too? - RAJNIKANT: Yes, give her all. - CHANDNI: Give me some money. - RAJNIKANTH: I will give you. Hello, Rajni. Surprised to see you here. How come you are in Ahmedabad? We have come here to shop for marriage. Are you here for shopping as well? Rajni. - Who is she? - Can I tell you? No, I will tell them. I will tell. - You know my friend's second wife. - Yes. No, actually he has only one wife. The second daughter from his wife. She has become the mother of her husband. - Become? - Yes, 24 years ago. And her husband passed away this year. Oh, I see! Oh! No, Mandakini. - We are just friends. Let's go. - No. You told her everything about me. I want to know about her. - The people with bottle have come. - Bottle? Yes! Now I will have to go. Bye. She has a hobby of collecting bottles. She collects bottles of all sizes. - What are these bottles? - I will explain you once we get back home. - Come. - Okay! Hey, are you mad? Hasmukh. Hasmukh. Hasmukh. Rajni, we will have to go from here. Dr. KD and her daughter are here. We have to run from here. - Akash and Madakini are also here. - What? Yes, Oh God! If Mandakini and Sridevi see each other then it will be my last day today. If you do these kind of deeds, you will obviously soon have a last day. Oh man! My life has become a hell after I got married twice. Do one thing. You look for Chandni and I will look for my black moon. - What? - I mean, I'll look for Sridevi. You look for Sapna. Hurry up. Let's go. - You fool, are you going to look for Chandni in the night? - No, no! - Then go and look for her. - Yes. The man is weird. I am asking him to look this side and he went the other side. I have already selected this saree. If possible, can you select some other saree, please? No. I don't like when someone else tries to take things that I like. And if someone likes what I like then I get very angry. Then you keep it. - No problem. - So sweet. - Thank you so much. - Welcome. Hasmukh, please pay the bill. - Your husband's name is Hasmukh? - Yes. - Even my husband's name was Hasmukh. - What do you mean by 'was'? - Are you guys divorced? - No. - He passed away. - Oh! - So sad. - His soul takes care of me. - And I feel he is around me right now. - So lucky you are. Thank you. Your husband is no more and is still around you. He takes care of you. And look at my husband. He suddenly disappeared when he had to pay the bill. I don't know whether my daughter will actually get married or not. - Your daughter is getting married? - Yes. - My son is also getting married. - Really? Congratulations and all the best. - Thank you. Congratulations to you as well. - Thank you - I will look for Hasmukh. - Okay. Hasmukh. This one also. Hasmukh. Hasmukh. That lady forgot her phone. I think it is hers. Where should I look for her? Where would she have gone? (Cellphone Ringing) - Hello. - Hello. Sridevi, where are you? I am not Sridevi. I am Mandakini. I dialed Sridevi. How did Mandakini received my call? This is Sridevi's number. 'Hello. Hello.' - 'Hello?' - Hello. - Hello. - You are her husband, aren't you? Yes, I am Hasmukh Jobanputra. Sridevi's husband. Your name and voice are the the same as my husband. - You still think it is same? - No. By the way, where can you meet me? I have to return this phone. I am dead. Now what should we do? I am dead. (Indistinct Chatters) "I am trapped." Why are you so scared? It is me. Hasmukh, I lost my phone somewhere. - I will buy you a new one. - No. I have way to many pictures in that phone. I may have left it in that shop. - Come with me to find it. - But listen to me. - Let's go. - Listen, I'll get you a new one. Listen to me... - Oh Hi! - Hi! - Your phone. - My phone. Thank God. My phone. You had left your phone there. Let us go in that shop. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. To be honest, I was in so much tension. - Thank God you got this phone. - I need to tell you one thing. Not only the name of our husband is same but also his voice is similar. Who is this sitting here? Actually he is tying his shoe lace. Hasmukh, she has come to return my phone. - Hello, Hasmukh. - Hello! Hello. (Background Music) "There was one king and two queens" "He and his story" "It has been so much fun" - Listen. - What? I have some urgent work. I will be back in a while. But... Mom. - Yes? - I am hungry. Let's go to the cafe. - She is my daughter. - She is so sweet. I wanted a daughter just like her. - But he passed away early. - So sad. - Aunty! Sapna! - She is like your daughter. I saw a ghost on the second floor. Ghost? It would surely be of my husband. Sorry. I'll need to go. - Bye. - Thank God. Hasmukh, let's go to see her husband's ghost. Look at me. Don't I look like a living ghost? - Let's go. - Let's go. Akash! - Akash. - Mom's here. - Did you see your dad's ghost? - No. - Did you see it? - No. I did not see it. But I have a constant feeling that his ghost is somewhere around. He said it was second floor. Why am I not able to see it? Can we go home? No, no. I want to buy jewellery for Juhi. You can go and shop for the jewellery. I will go and have a coffee. - Let's go, Akash. - Come on, dear. No. I will go with Juhi. Let's go. - How much? - Hundred rupees. (Machine Sound) Where is my debit card? Sorry, friend. What type of person is he? Listen. - Yes. - Did I leave my debit card here? Sorry, sir. Your debit card is not here. Please, check if you can find it. - Do you have CCTV? - Yes, we have it. - Please, check it. - Okay. - I think you came here an hour ago, right? - Yes. I will show you the recording. One minute. One minute. - Wait I shall show. - Go reverse. Wait. This is your debit card? No! This man is alive. Sir, a man will obviously be alive. - A ghost will not come here for shopping. - Correct. A ghost will not come for shopping. If it is a ghost, it is not even captured in the camera. Caught him. This man is caught. This man is alive. I got the proof. I found him. - Are you crazy? - I am a psychiatrist. This man made me crazy. He shamed me in front of others. Now I will take the revenge, Hasmukh Jobanputra. I will bite you so bad that you will not even be able to apply ointment. Yes, I will get the things. Hello. (Indistinct Chatters) You said that you want to talk about something important. What is it? - I am here with a request. - What are you doing? We should keep the marriage at Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad. But why? Don't say no. My ancestral house is in Ahemdabad. The elders in my family feel the marriage should take place in Ahmedabad. But there are two days left for marriage. Will we get the marriage hall at such a last moment? You don't worry about that. In Ahemdabad, there is 'SHAGUN' party hall. I have already booked it. Okay. - What are you saying? - Yes! - Dr. KD has shifted the marriage from Baroda to Ahemdabad? - Yes. - That too in the party hall besides ours? - Yes. What should I do now? On one side will be our marriage and their marriage on the other side. On one side will be my daughter and on the other side will be my son. On one side you are alive and on the other side you are dead. I am dead. - Oh God! - Let us call off this marriage. - What do you mean father-in-law? - I mean postponed. - That is fine. - What shall I do? Sridevi. Sridevi. Sridevi? - Yes. - Sridevi. Sridevi. - There is a serious matter. - Yes. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. But we will have to postpone the marriage. - Why? - Listen. Just like we take a second opinion from a doctor. Similarly, I took a second opinion of the astrologer. Then I realized that the day and time for Sapna's marriage is totally incorrect. This astrologer said that Sapna does not have a strong Jupiter effect. So if the wedding will take place on the 3rd... ...I will get an heart attack. And you will be a widow. Why do you trust any strange people? Nothing will happen to you. - But... - This astrologer is from my maternal side. - So? - I fully trust him. And his father had gotten us married. - Hence I am saying... - Was there a problem in our marriage? - Our married life is going great, isn't it? - Yes. That's it. - This marriage won't be postponed under any circumstances. - But... What happened to you, Hasmukh? - What happened? - You have tanned so much. I have tanned? Yes. You know the clinic of Dr. Bansree Viral for hair and skin? - Bansree Viral's clinic? - Yes. Go there for a treatment. - Okay. - I will get you an appointment. - Okay. - And please, get a facial. - Facial? - I'll talk later with you. What will you do getting a facial when you won't be able to show your face to anyone? See... This marriage will not get canceled under any circumstances. Find a new party plot. Its wedding season right now. No party plots are available. Everyone is getting married except me. Hey you, bachelor! Why are you worried about your marriage? Just think about what is going to happen to me on the day of the wedding. (Singing In Nearby) - How are you? Everything's fine right? - Fine... Girls, keep this tray next to the astrologer. How are you? Don't go without having food. Please, sit. How are you? - Rajni? - Yes? - You are here? - Yes. Weren't you suppose to be in Baroda for the wedding of Hasmukh's friend? But I am worried about here. - What do you mean? - I mean... This marriage is so close to me. That's true. Good that you are here. Please, help Hasmukh. He is going to need a lot of help. I have some work. 'This moment is of confusion for a father.' 'There is happiness on one side.' And sadness on the other. One side, the daughter is going to a new fascinating world. 'And on the other hand, a sad heart for having to part with his daughter.' Excuse me. What wrong have I done to you? Why are you repeatedly taking my name? Why, Hasmukh? Did I make a mistake Hasmukh? Since you are repeatedly taking my name, that is making me even more sad. I will give you some extra money for not saying my name. Please, don't take my name. Okay, Hasmukh. Rajni. Rajni. Rajni. Wait. - Wait. - Tell me. Who brought this fool here? - Huh? - He is repeatedly taking my name. Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Tell him to stop or I will hit him. If he continues to take my name I will choke him to death. But I don't know who brought him here. - I was preparing for the Baroda wedding. - So who brought him here? Maybe he is from Sridevi's family. That is it. Tell him not to take my name or else I will hit him. - Yes. - PRIEST: Call the bride. I hope the wedding finishes fast. Or else I will die. ANNOUNCER: 'Hasmukh's friend...' That fool took my name again. How are you? Sridevi go and get Sapna fast. - Why? - We have to give her away. What? We need her for the rituals. Go fast. And tell her to click pictures later. Call her fast. - Complete the rituals fast. - Hasmukh! Don't teach us about rituals. The marriage will happen as per the rituals. There will be no shortcut. - But... - That's right. Did I say anything? I haven't even said anything. - First, sound... - Hey, listen... Yes? I will explain after I am back. Be careful. What happened? I hope everything is fine. - Everything is fine. - Look... No one should come here from the other wedding. - I am there. - Even if one person comes here and sees me. They will think of me as a ghost and they will die here. Uncle, don't worry at all. I am there. No one will be able to come here. Yes? Do you want to see it? Look at my team. I think there is some mistake. Hasmukh KD is here? - Run away. - How can I? I am the bride's father. I have to be here for the rituals. You guys hold on to KD. And take him to their side of the wedding. Throw him out of here. One minute. I have to talk about something urgent. There is a terrorist in the wedding hall. Come fast. What are you doing here? I am asking you the same. What are you doing here so early? You had to come later. So go. Few rituals are still pending. But your ritual will happen in the other place. My wedding will take place here. Who is coming to get married here? - Akash. - Yes! Akash is my son-in-law. Come on, dear. - Block his way. - Hey, you... I will slap you. Get aside. - Hey... - Get aside, please. He is a bald with specs. He is calling himself a gentleman and a physiological doctor. 'Hasmukh's dear daughter Sapna is arriving on the stage for her marriage.' Priest, the bride has come. Priest, the bride has come. What is this? Two girls on the same stage? This is my daughter's wedding hall. How did you get in? And who is this girl? Forget about me, who are you? Why did you come here? We have booked this party plot. No Dr. KD. I have been trying to explain. - Your marriage is on the other side. - Yes, let's go. We have booked this party plot. How is it possible? I have booked the party plot. - You occupied it and built the hut? - Yes. Hut? He is misbehaving with me. - Who is this man? Get him out of here. - Dad. - Dad! Where are you? - Call your father. No, Sapna. No need to call anyone. Come aside, we will talk. - Everybody stay quiet! - (Crackers Sound) Our fireworks have started. Looks like the groom is here. - Let's go. The groom is here. - Let's go. Look at this. He is riding a white horse... - ...and with dreams in his eyes. - Listen to me. The handsome prince of Sapna has come for the marriage. Let's go to welcome him. "You have finally come" "You have finally come" "What have you got for us?" (Music Playing) Hey go reverse... Take me away from here. Let's go, come on... (Music Overlaps Dialogues) Stop. Stop. Wow! Two wedding processions? Now it will be fun to dance. Yes. There are 2 grooms here. Which procession do we have to welcome? You are here? And you are also here. We had met in the mall. You were with Rajni. What are you doing here? It is my son Akash's wedding. No, no! It is my son Akash's wedding. (Horse Neigh) Rajni, what are you doing there? Come here. I had gone to check all the arrangements. Rajni, do you know them? Yes, she is my friend's wife. All the people have gathered here. Is this a coincidence or there is a mess? I don't know what's going on. But why are you here? My daughter Sapna is getting married here. No, my daughter Juhi is getting married here. - What? - Yes. What are you saying? (Gunshot) (Indistinct) Be quiet everyone. Somebody told me that my son Parth's is getting married here. Now who is he? Bhura. You are here? It is not Parth's wedding. It is my son Akash's wedding. - I want to look at the face of both the grooms. - Okay. He is not the one. He is hiding his face. Looks like he is the one. Get aside everyone. Should I tell you all separately? Get aside. - Get me out of here. - Why are you going back? Just stand there. Show me your face. - Show me. - Show your face. Show me. - Parth, it's you? - Parth! You are getting married without us? - Mom, this is just a trial. - What? How do I look? He is my on Akash. You married someone else? I don't even know her. She is a bar dancer. Isn't it, Chandni? - She is a bar dancer? - Yes! - What's all this? - I am not able to understand anything. Wait a minute. Let me explain. Everyone come inside. I am Dr. KD psychiatrist. I will explain you in detail. - Come inside. - Come on in. Looks like he will expose me today. What is all this happening? Who are all these people? Should I call the police? Please, be quiet for a while. Now explain us. What is all this confusion? I will explain you everything. You call your husband Hasmukh. No, please don't call him. He is a ghost. I get scared when I see a ghost. Dr. KD, people are getting scared. - We should not call a ghost in marriage. - He is right. Why are you all behaving like this? I am not asking to call Mandakini's husband. I am asking to call Sridevi's husband. Call him. - Should I call him? - Yes! Hasmukh. - Hasmukh. - Dad. - Hasmukh. - Dad. Where is your father? He is not there when we need him. He is not here. Let us all go. - Let us go. - Hey, wait. "Manipulations and exchanges" "Manipulations and exchanges" You are scaring my husband. I am not going to let you go. Come on. Come on. He is Hasmukh. Why are you worried by a ghost? By the way, he is not a ghost. - Dad. - Dad? Yes, dad. I'll tell you! Dad. Hey... - Come here, my child. - Dad. Hasmukh! Hasmukh. Hasmukh. You are alive? "Manipulations and exchanges." - Hasmukh? - Hasmukh! - Hasmukh? - Hasmukh! - Hasmukh. - Is he not a ghost? No. This is a story created by his clever mind. I knew something was wrong. You threw away all your money due to him. He is not a dead ghost. But a ghost that is alive. I was telling you from the start. There is a fraud man behind every ghost story. There is a fraud behind this ghost. Hence I wanted to expose him in front of everyone. So I changed the venue of the marriage. And I came here in your marriage hall. I have already booked another hall for me. This means that you were fooling us for so many days. You kept meeting us as a ghost. No... Hasmukh. What is all this? - Else I will hit you in front of all. - Why will you hit him? I will hit him. He is my husband. But I am his first wife. So I get to hit him first. You are not the first wife. I am the first wife. He was dead at my place. - You keep quiet. - Talk properly. - Stupid. - You don't fight with each other. Please. I am your common husband. - What? - Please don't get upset. I beg of you. - Please, don't cry, Mandu. - Mandu? I am just trying to pacify her. Please. Actually it is all my father's fault. It is true that I was in love with Mandakini and got married. Didn't I tell you that I was the first one? Yes. Mandu, please! Try to understand. Don't get upset. It is true that I got married to her. But do you know what my father told me? That I cannot marry any other girl. I can only get married to Sridevi. Sridevi's father died when he was trying to save me. Yes! He banged his head in the well and died. Hence, my father had promised him on his grave. That he will not let Sridevi be an orphan. He will make her his daughter-in-law. Hence I had to get married to her. Please, don't cry. Don't cry, Sridevi. - Don't get upset, Mandu. - Mandu! I was doing all this for your future... ...and for the future of our kids. I was lying to both of you against my wish. I am sorry. Please, forgive me. It means that you were also lying to me, Parth? - Just listen to me. - A false name and a false mother. You made a bar dancer your mother? She is not a bar dancer. I have made her my sister. Just listen to me, Sapna. If I had told you the truth, your dad would have been exposed. My name is false, but my love for you is true. I care for you and hence I did not tell this to my parents. What else can I do to prove my love? - Sapna... - Dear, he is right. He wanted to tell you the truth. But I stopped him. I asked him not to tell the truth. It is all my fault. Please, forgive me, my child. Sorry, Sapna. - It's okay. - But I'm not going to leave you. - You are gone. - Mom... He is the person due to which dad is a good man now. If you do anything to him, I will not be you son. But you don't know how much we lost due to him. Let us be. He is our only child. What shall you do with money, if he is gone? I forgive you, Hasmukh. Thank you Bhura. The outsiders have forgiven me now. I have married you in the presence of God. Won't you forgive me? Forgive you? I am going to teach you a lesson today. - Isn't it, sister? - Correct. - No, Mandu! - Come on. - Hasmukh. Hasmukh. - No, Sridevi. No! (Clack) "Manipulations and exchanges" "Manipulations and exchanges" - SAPNA: Dad. - MANDAKINI: Hasmukh. - AKASH: Dad! - SAPNA: Dad! - Dad! - Hasmukh, open your eyes. - He has opened his eyes. - He is alive. HASMUKH: Who are you all? HASMUKH: Who are all these colorful people? - HASMUKH: Where am I? - I think he has forgotten everything. - What? No! - Hasmukh. Till he was alive, he was sandwiched between his two wives. He manipulated his whole life with two pillars and then he hit an actual pillar. His memory was gone. Both the wives were waiting for him to regain his memory. They wanted to scold him and punish him. I have been telling everyone. Be careful when getting married if you want to be happy in your life. We had to learn this from lord Krishna. He knew about life from the time of his birth. But he never shared it with anyone while he was in Gokul. He was just fooling around with them. And when Shishupal bad mouthed him, he did not play his flute. He hits him back with his weapons. If we learn this one thing from his life... ...where to fool around and where to punish people. We will never have to do any manipulations. (Applause) Hence it was said in the past. If husband and wife are thinking alike, they will be happy. Socrates has a good definition for marriage. If you want to make your married life happy... ...then both husband and wife should work together. Only one is sufficient to make it a mess. An English writer named Helington says that you... ...will immediately know if you get a bad wife. You will immediately know if you get a bad wife. But you will never realize when you get a good wife, pal. - Very nice, Sairam. - Wow! That's nice. All your programs are awesome. - All? - Which others do you remember? Me? Let me think.
