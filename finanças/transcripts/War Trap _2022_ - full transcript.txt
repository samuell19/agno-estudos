Head to the right. Section on the right on the hillside. Two o'clock - 400 meters. Damnit, flanked from both sides. Heavy fire, at two o'clock. Sir, one of our men is out there... he's from a different regiment- What? Here, take a look... What the fuck is he doing? We're gonna be overtaken! Sergeant, what should we do? Almost our entire section has been evacuated. We won't be able to hold on! We'll soon have links with the outside and with command! As long as this situation isn't critical, we must continue to hold this position. These are orders! Damn we're all gonna die! Sergeant, I think things are critical right now. Damn it, give the order to retreat, we need to get out of here! Hold on! Eh ! Okay. Okay, Okay. Just... Just relax. Just stay calm. I can't give up. I have to keep trying. What the fuck! No, no, no, no, no. I need to be able to breathe. Control yourself Eugène... Control yourself.... Okay, Okay... calm down. You have to... Yeah, that's it. We are proud of you son. Your mother and I want you to promise us, that you'll take care of yourself. We'll always be by your side. But over there, you only have yourself. I promise. I will make it. May God hear you my son. We love you. I will get out. Papa. You told me that you will always be by my side. Today I really need to feel that. I'm a liar. Now I'm all alone... and I'm not gonna make it. I feel like I'm already in a coffin. And I'll die. Alone... Talk to me... Eugène, stay close! Dad, I saw an animal that went into the ground and disappeared. Is it mean? No son, it's a mole. Where did she go? With her strong paws she digs into the ground... and pushes the dirt behind her as she goes deeper. In the ground? Yes, deep in the ground, where no one sees her and where she's safe. Can we go too? We could try if we had tools, but we wouldn't catch her, she's too good at this game. Come on, Mama's waiting for us. Come on Eugène! She digs into the ground, and pushes the dirt behind her as she goes deeper. In the ground? Yes, deep in the ground, where no one sees her and where she's safe. Papa, it's crazy... but I'll try... I promise, I'll try. Shit! Agh! I'm gonna get out of here, I gotta get out of here. Like the mole, Papa. I can't get out through the top... so I'm going to dig and get out of this hole. I'm not going to die buried. It won't end like this. I don't know if I'll make it, but I'll at least try. I won't lay down and die. This damn earth is not going to bury me... I will fight with everything I have, to my last breath. Damn the Germans, damn the shell that buried me, and to hell with this life that played this trick on me. Hey! Anyone alive down there? They won't get me. I'm gonna make it. Just calm down... I can do it. There must be a reason I am still alive. I'm not alone. I'm not alone. Calm down, calm down, calm down. I just need to take a deep breath, everything will be fine. I was in there, so I can't be that deep, and it's only dirt and debris. There must be a way out. Fuck this fucking shit! No, no no... It can't die now! Turn on again, come on! Please, don't let me down. Yes, hey, hey. Come on, stay on... Alright! Alright! I knew you wouldn't let me down. That's it, I'm losing it. I'm talking to the goddamn light. Papa, I should be talking to you instead. It's thanks to you I can control my fear, and I know you're with me. You always have been. Always have been. I know... I don't have the agility of a mole, and even less with a dislocated arm. And don't tell Mom about this please, she would be worried sick. We'll tell her after it's over. What is this bullshit? Are you testing me? Am I that bad that I deserve to go through all this? I'm going to fight, I'm not going to die here. Do what you want, I don't care, I won't give up. Okay, come on Eugène, be a man. Only going to be a moment of pain. Just a short moment... It will be fine. Just a quick snap... Shit! You are far stronger than that Eugène! Come on! So I guess this is going to be it. I'm crazy... and hallucinating... and I'm gonna die here... and nobody will even know. What bullshit, to hell with this war that is burying me alive. Thank you God. Dirty critter... Shit! I am not dreaming. God please, don't let my brain play tricks on me. Is someone there? Yes, I'm here. Come on, whomever you are, talk to me! I'm not alone, thank God I'm not alone. I thought I was going crazy hearing noises. I didn't believe it... I really didn't believe it was happening either. Who are you? Eugène Tuco, I'm stuck here. I've been down here awhile, and there's not much air. Eugène Tuco... we are from the same section. We don't know each other, but I know who you are. I'm Joseph, transmissions... I know it's crazy, but I will do my job until the end. That's almost ironic... What happened up there in the gallery? I don't recall. There was a bomb from the Krauts that went off when they saw that we were holding our positions. It happened so fast I didn't understand everything either, but I've been here, stuck for hours in complete silence... except for the noise of these damn shells that fell nearby probably our bombers who continue to spray death. I'm afraid no one else survived here. But wait, you're telling me you're stuck? I was a bit away from the main entrance when the bomb hit. Where are you? I don't know. I don't remember hearing an explosion. Everything went black! I lost consciousness and when I came to, I was stuck underground. I am in a tunnel somewhere, like those, used by the Krauts to store rations or ammunition, except everything was buried by tons of debris and earth. I don't know how I'm still alive, It's hard to breathe. I moved forward, but I don't know in which direction. There must have been a collapse of the tunnels up above you. I'm still somewhere up top, but it isn't looking good. My stomach is wounded badly. And a large metal pipe is crushing my leg. How can you move forward if you're stuck below? I don't understand. I'm like a mole. I can't go up though, too risky, one mistake and I'll be buried. So I'm digging a tunnel like a mole, like a mole. Like a mole. I know, it's hard to explain. I don't think I'll last much longer, It's become really, really hard to breathe here. I feel like I'm in a coffin. Listen to me Eugène. I don't know how the hell you were able to survive this long down here. I probably would already be dead if I were you. But hang in there, okay? Huh? You must be close by, wherever you're stuck is most likely somewhere between some storage compartments. We had just started to unwind the wires, it was Francis who was in charge of the phone lines you are using. He was unwinding the wires when everything exploded. I saw him evaporate in the explosion. I was able to withdraw about ten meters, but I couldn't get anymore. The rest must still be buried somewhere. You have to follow the threads. Okay Eugène? Follow them and you'll get through. You can't give up just yet, hang on. I've been fighting this whole time. I want to live. You won't just save your own life. I can't get out of here on my own. I am going to get us out of here. You can count on me. End of communication. You got this, you're strong Eugène. I'll make sure you have time to get there. Follow the wires... and get out... follow the wires... Don't panic. It's just wood creaking. No, no, no, not now. I'm here Eugène. I'm going to die... so talk to me please. Woah, woah, hello Eugène. I'm with you, what's up? I can't breathe anymore... I can't anymore. Calm down Eugène, okay? Talk to me... let me hear the sound of your voice. Talk to me, about anything. Joseph please. Ok, ok. I, uh... Save me. Ok Eugène hold on. I don't have one from you, but I am in charge of the letters. From the other guys. If you want I can read you one. Is that ok? Yes, yes do that... go ahead and read me the letters... ...read the letters. Censorship would have opened them anyway. "Dear Mom and Dad," "I hope you are both doing well and" "above all that you are not worrying too much." "Sometimes my letters are not too reassuring" "but things are hard here." "I never imagined spending my life here like this," "among other young people like me," "who I don't have time to know." "The days aren't that long," "but some nights seem to go on forever," "haunted by the hiss of the bullets," "the crash of explosions echoing in my eardrums." "I would love to be with you so badly," " to wake up and realize..." "that it was all a nightmare," "and see only smiling people around me," "without uniforms and without weapons." "But at least it's not for nothing, right?" "It is enough for me to tell myself" "that by taking up arms as I do," "that you will be safe and living in good health," "and every day, I always wish..." "that you could be further away from this war..." "...of barbarism, defeat and madness." "I continue to tell myself all this" "to comfort my heart," "and to feel more alive than I have ever been," "this life that you have given me..." "I offer back to you in thanks." "I am convinced that my next letter..." "will be tinged with a growing hope" "because our lines are constantly advancing," "a little more," "pushing back the enemy," "who we will defeat." "So please don't worry about your son..." "who loves and misses you." "I'll be home soon." "So eagerly await my arrival." "All of my thoughts and kisses I send to you." "Also kiss Scruffy..." "Also kiss Scruffy for me and tell him that I will be back..." "very soon to play with him again." "Your son, Leonard." So Eugène, I know it probably wasn't the best idea to read you this. Because he won't be coming back. May he rest in peace. Listen to me. I will live. And we will find and rescue those who survived. Okay? I pray you do. Eugène? Eugène? Tell me you'll pull through. Come at me... If you're a Kraut you're- even though you essentially might be a good person... If you have the wrong uniform I will shoot you. Come on... I'll help you. Why? I wanted to help. Eugène? I saw my life go by. I believed... I really believed that this time was the end. Everything collapsed on me, There is a corpse above my head, and then... What Eugène? What's wrong? Talk to me. You told me about Francis who was in transmissions... a good friend? More like a brother. Not just a friend. Why are you asking me about Francis? Why Eugène? Why are you asking me that? I'm sorry... hopefully he didn't suffer. Nobody should have to go through this nightmare. Nobody... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Joseph, do you hear me? We both have to fight. Why would you do that? I wanted to help. Shut up. It's pointless to talk. I don't know what you're saying. I beg you. My little brother... I want to see him again, I beg you. I'm so sorry. Forgive me... It has to end... it has to end... it has to end... it has to end... it has to end... Joseph? I heard something... like a gunshot. Joseph, hello? Answer me, I heard... Eugène? Eugène, I killed him, I killed him. Killed who? I killed him. I... I... I heard the shot. That means that I heard your shot. So I'm not very far from you. We'll get out... We'll get out and live! You hear? Get out... and live... At least survive. Please, hurry Eugène. I'll hold on. When it collapsed a whole section of the tunnel emerged in front of me, and I see like a beam. There must be an exit. I'll get there. I did it Dad... I found the exit. I'm coming out. Joseph, I'm coming out, there is a tunnel in front of me... we're gonna make it. Eugène? Eugène answer me. You still there? Oh shit! Eh! Eh! Eugène? Eugène! I can hear you! I hear you! I hear you! Do you see something, do you see my flashlight? No, the wires run along a tunnel I can't see from where I am at. But you must not be far since I can hear you. I can hear you too, I hear you. I'm almost there. Eugène? It's over, we won't make it... Why not? What's happening? I can't... I can't get through. What do you mean? I don't know if it's the first explosion or the shelling afterwards, but the entire area collapsed. But the wires go through a pile of metal beams... and I can't move them... and I'm blocked by impassable bars. You must be on the other side, but I can't reach you. I don't know how I held out for so long down here without being able to breathe. I'm too tired. Don't worry Eugène, you did what you could. At least we won't die alone. Eugène... Eugène...we have to try something. We have to try everything. We have nothing to lose. Wait, listen to me, I'm sorry, I won't make it, there's no access, and I'm not going back to the coffin. I know but... we can still try something else. There is no certainty that it will work. We can still go back. It's your decision, but if this grid is behind this opening it might work. I'm ready. Do it. If it doesn't work, it can bury you completely. Do it. Eugène! You did it! You did it. No, we did it! Come on, we have to get out of here, get this off. Okay, Okay. Okay, do it. Go! I can't. Go. Come on. Let's not waste time, you have to get up. Enemy! They were stationed outside of this tunnel. They must have heard the grenade explosion. Dammit, we're stuck. Not yet, finding another exit may be possible. Let's go before they find us. Turn it off. I don't think they followed us. No, not yet... but if we don't find another way out... ...we're trapped in here. Go! Wait... I'm in so much pain. At least put my bandage back on. You don't have any morphine? Just one dose. I'm saving it for when it gets unbearable. They're behind us. We have to get out of here, I'll help you. I wish they would listen to me. We may have found our way out. I pray you are right. Eugène... We did it. I can't believe it. I thought I would die in this hole. I know. We need to get out of here now. Come on Eugène, we have to move. The mortar fire we hear is from our guys, but they are on the other side of the hills. The Germans took over our positions, all of them. All our guys died over there. But we knew. We all knew that we were outnumbered, and we couldn't keep holding these positions. It was suicide. And now we're back here behind the enemy. Yeah, just behind. Because some of the Germans are below. We'll have to get past the enemy lines, We can make it through. Eugène. What? I don't think I deserve to make it out alive. With my leg, I wouldn't blame you if- We both survive... or we both die, okay? Then get up. They're coming! Wait! Wait. I can't keep going. There's no way. Yes, you can, you have to fight. I will help you to reach our lines together, alright? Alright, let's go. Let's go. No, you have to go. I'm going to ruin your chance of making it. I'm done for. You gotta go. No way, you're coming with me, okay? We are back from hell and you have no right to give up now. Come on, get up! Okay... Come on, stand up, stand up! Wait, ah, wait. Wait, wait, I can't do it anymore. I'm sorry Eugène, I can't. I can't go on. I'm sorry, just leave! I'm sorry Eugène. Go on. Just leave, just leave. Okay Joseph. If that's how it is... I have no choice. I would love to get there. I'm scared to die alone. Then keep on fighting. Let me finish Eugène, please. It's true that I'm scared, but I'm lucid. How much longer can you last with me on your back? Don't lie to yourself. You have already given me more than enough hope, and I thank you for that. At least one of us should survive. And we know very well that if one of us has a chance... it's you. But only if you leave me, and you know that. You talk a lot for being in agony. Come on. Wait! Stop. I can't anymore. I can't anymore, it hurts too much, I can't hold on anymore. I want it to stop, I'm begging you, please stop. Please stop. Okay Joseph, let's take a break. Slowly... No. Joseph, listen. Listen, Joseph. I'm in so much pain... Joseph, I know, we're going to take a break and recover, okay? Okay? No! Don't touch me anymore, don't touch me anymore! You hear! I'm not moving. I'm not moving. The morphine! You told me that you were keeping it for your pain right? Now is the time. Here. It will relieve the pain, alright? Try to relax, relax. The pain will go away, okay? You don't give up, huh. It hurts! It hurts! Section on the right on the hillside. At 2 o'clock, 400 meters. As I thought, flanked from both sides. Heavy fire, at two o'clock, 400 meters. Sir! One of our men is out there! He's from a different regiment. What? Have a look! What the fuck's he doing? He can't get here. He won't even last a minute. We can't help him. Aw damn! We'll try to help him or at least let him breathe. Sustained barrage fire, same position, 400 meters. He'll die if he tries to come. Don't do that man, find another solution. We can't get you out of there. The son of a bitch, he did it! This guy has balls of steel. They're so busy trying to kill us, that they didn't even see him pass. Take two men with you and go back. Take the Jeep and go around the river. Wait for our soldier. That guy will surely try to join us. We'll get him...Go! With me in the Jeep, one of our guys needs help.
