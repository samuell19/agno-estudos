The news of Europe as it occurs the world is now awaiting the arrival in Berlin of German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. America must keep out of this war the President the Congress should be supported in their every effort to keep us out. At 9 a.m. this morning his Majesties Ambassador in Berlin informed the German government a state of war would exist between the two countries as from that hour Now we are at war and we are going to make war and persevere in making war until the other side has had enough of it. My great uncle Raemer Schreiber was born in 1910, in Yamhill County, Oregon. He got up and did chores early before school everyday I know he played with his cousins he'd go out and build a campfire for lunch and play for the afternoon and then return just before dinner. He attended McMinnville High School and then on to undergrad at Linfield College he did Masters work at the University of Oregon and completed a doctorate in physics at Purdue University. He was a teaching assistant they had to have a summer job so Uncle Raemer and Aunt Marge would come back to Oregon where he worked on my grandfathers farm. I think it said of Uncle Raemer to have an amazing work ethic for the rest of his life. He had opportunity and a place to come back too, they put up some vegetables, that they could take back with them for the school year and it was a chance to see family. My dad and his farming days in McMinnville were long and tedious and tiring it was certainly pre- gasoline powered engine even for the threshing machine because when he was ten, they were threshing with a steam powered thresher which had a belt on it that looked like it could wrap up a building he did not like farming, and in fact he thought he was going to be an electrician when he was ten electricity came to the valley he spent some period of time wiring the houses it might have been at Linfield, but Im inclined to think it was more at the University of Oregon where he got diverted to physics, and it was a result of a professors intervention and it was a very fortuitous decision on his part needless to say. My mom decided to come for my graduation then in June of '41 we spent several pleasant weeks together graduation was the usual thing she probably only stayed two or three weeks because pop wasn't in good health at that time. I think the physicists that came of age in the 1930's and early 40's, represented American society as a whole there were a fair number including Scheib, who grew up on farms, some like Oppenheimer and Teller came from well to do families so I would say the physicists represented American society at the time, you had a little bit of everything all kinds of backgrounds all kinds of religions. Schreiber epitomised physics and physicist out of the first era of modernization they were exploring new territory. E is equal MC squared showed that very amount of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy. If Germany was going to build an atomic bomb Heisenberg was going to be the Oppenheimer of Germany Heisenberg collaborating with others in Germany and Denmark elucidated the structure of complex atoms and announced the principle of indeterminacy of physical measurements. Heisenberg was an internationally renowned physicist he came for a physics conference and I know lectured around the country Uncle Raemer took pictures of him and listened to his lectures this was a brilliant man who had every possibility of developing the bomb before we got it done in America. One day a knock at the door and there was Dr Oppenheimer coming to see him he'd remembered that Raemer had taken photos in those lectures at Purdue and he asked if he still have the negatives? We'll Percival and I put in that summer and fall getting the Cyclotron physically removed into the new laboratory, expected to take me all the next year with the help of several graduate students in doing this. This was a very important tool in early nuclear research a lot of people who got started in the Manhattan Project had a background in in some topic related to particle accelerator technology of the day, Cyclotrons were an important emerging tool in the study of nuclear scattering and nuclear reactions he was really in an ideal place at Purdue with that Cyclotron, to jump off the precipice of the new Nuclear physics as it became important for national security. We'll that summer after I did a couple more things to wind up my thesis for publication, which I never did quite get wound up for. For my dads thesis, my mom typed it, I know is an act of intense activity because it was submitted 5 hours before it was due and I don't know how many times my mother typed it? I would guess at the end of the year that she probably knew as much about what dad did as dad did because she had learn how to spell all that stuff. Schreib was truly unique at Los Alamos during the war there were 6 or 7 thousand scientists, technicians but there really were only 2 or 3 people who could actually build an atomic bomb actually put it together handle the parts, Schreib was one of those people, Outside of Holloway and one other person these are the only guys who could really build an atomic bomb Oppenheimer could conceive it, Teller could conceive it, Bethe could conceive it, but those guys really couldn't build it they couldn't put their hands on it, they couldnt' assemble it and so this was the role that Schreib played both at Trinity and again with Fatman on Tinian later on. 1938 brought the startling discovery of fission of the Uranium Nucleus by Neutron bombardment, leading names in this research carried on in Germany were Dr Otto Hahn and Dr Fritz Strassmann. The discovery of nuclear fission was like the discovery of fire. It was the first major form of energy that does not depend upon ultimately the sun so it was a turning point for humankind when that discovery was made Lise Meitner, working at Copenhagen soon demonstrated that fission of the nucleus was accompanied by a release of enormous amounts of energy. Time was short the inevitable entry of the United States was accepted one reason for the decision to concentrate forces against the Germans was recognition that German scientists could produce weapons of great devastation. Through the cunard ladies and gentlemen we interrupt this broadcast to bring you an important bulletin from United Press flash Washington the White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor stay tuned to WOR for further developments... On December 7th, 1941 there was Pearl Harbor we'll we weren't sure what to do, research came to a grinding halt as what was there for a nuclear physicist to do? Oppenheimer and a number of others were recruiting extensively across the United States would raid universities for graduate talent if Oppenheimer couldn't convince say a mentor directly he would call on James Conant at Harvard to intervene on his behalf and so these people were released very often reluctantly and with some animosity during the early part of the war. There's a continuing question of what did I do to help out the war effort and periodically somebody would come in recruiting for these other war related research jobs and every time I'd be interviewed I'd go and tell Dr Lark-Horovitz about it and he'd raise my salary a little bit and say "stick it out, don't want you to go, do the work here". Marshall Holloway showed up approached Perc and myself the deal was worked out that we were to work on a secret project that we couldn't be told about until we had agreed that we would indeed work on it, and of course we did agree our contacts we're through either Marshall or through Hans Bethe who was our theoretical consultant and we then worked our tails off morning, afternoon and evening and most Saturdays, we did did try to take Sundays off keep our wives happy, We'll in May of '43 we were invited to come out to Project Y. We finally convinced Hans Bethe that the large cross-section for the Deuterium/Tritium reaction we've been measuring all summer was for real and so, we closed out the project in September I well remember Schreiber coming home at noon, Paula was a baby and he sort of mysteriously, swished me back to the back of the house and then portentously said what would you think of going to New Mexico? All I knew about New Mexico was the Capital was Santa Fe and I had no idea what sort of a place it was, I thought it was all desert, rattlesnakes and things like that and actually it didn't sound to interesting but this was wartime and I said, its alright with me if you want to go Ill go Everybody was suppose to go and take whatever vacation they wanted to take for the duration and Marge and Paula got on the train and went out to Oregon Traveling in wartime is something you don't attempt unless you're strong and I wasn't strong but I was ignorant, I didn't realize how difficult it was going to be to take a baby and our luggage, my 70 plus year old mother and change trains and all of the soldiers traveling everyone traveling, the soldiers were a help they helped me any number of times when I got in a bind. And I had the car of course, I got to Santa Fe a day early and decided to follow my nose and see if I couldn't get up here to Los Alamos. So I knew the general direction to take and I then saw a rather broad road that showed a lot of signs of traffic turning off there, so I followed it came right up to the guard gate much to the consternation of the MPs. I asked for the gentleman whom I had been corresponding with here and they didn't know what quite what to do? But finally an MP got in the car with me and brought me in and I found the man in question and talked to him a little bit and he was a little surprised that I got in without any passes being arranged. But he started to to talk and I said we finished up work on the Cyclotron and he said shhh! Because the MP was standing outside and he had to keep me in his sight, because MPs didn't know what Cyclotrons were or why they were of interest there. Anyhow, having accomplished my mission essentially, mostly curiosity and I eventually got out to Oregon spent about 10 days there and then after many farewells Marge and Paula and I came back same route via Denver, well the time the bus hauled us into Santa Fe it was pushing on toward 5 I went roaring over to 109 East Palace for our passes and they said I hope we can get you through because they won't let you in up there after 6 o'clock well in the meantime we hadn't had any lunch, so on the way to or from 109 East Palace I'd seen a bakery and popped in there and got some sweet rolls. We started for Los Alamos gave Paula a sweet roll and shortly afterwards when we were going up the winding and dusty and hot mountainside she preceded to urrp everything up and of course Marge had just put her in fresh clothes so she would be pretty for the arrival, she arrived in the old Indian blanket which we still carry around in the back of the car. The announcement has been made in Athens tonight that the Greek armies in Albania have begun a general advance along the middle northern front the second big Italian counterattack has been thrown back and the fascists Athens says have again suffered heavy loses and that's all for tonight, listen to our regular news broadcasts and keep abreast of history in the making. I on the next day. After we arrived, went over with Marshall and Perce and was duly sworn in given a badge and taken in to read LA1 which was the primer, told me for the first time what was really suppose to be going on. Groves wanted it to be isolated not only for safety but also for security he was kind of obsessed with security and Oppenheimer wanted a place where people could be free to talk to each other, The whole system of the Manhattan Project was built around no one knowing more than they needed to know, to do the specific part of the work they were engaged in Oppenheimer understood that science does work that way it works by people talking to each other. He remembered that there was a ranch school so called, it was a private school a prep school for boys located on a mesa and that ranch school with its cluster of dormitories and cottages for the teachers and one big central hall could serve as a kind of a starting point for a laboratory. Where people could be all inside the fence if you will barbed wire fencing blocking them away from the rest of the world, but they can talk to each other and as soon as General Groves saw the place he knew that was the right place Oppenheimer thought maybe 30 men would be all they need they ended up with about 5000. Because Los Alamos was isolated you didn't have people coming and going. Your social life was really the people you work with or your neighbors there was some very large functions that were carried out at Fuller Lodge, and so you dressed up, you danced, you had music you drank, you had a good time and they were stress relievers for the laboratory as well, because the men in particular and a few women were working long shifts, long weeks and these parties when they came along were a great opportunity to relieve stress and to really laugh and have a good time, if only for a few hours. Parties at the lab during the war were very segregated, Mom and dad certainly partied with the Oppenheimer's and with the Jetties and with the Holloways and all the people they knew during the war, it was always fun I can tell you that. You didn't talk to the people who came to the parties about what they did because you just didn't do that so you had to have some other way of having a conversation with them which was certainly more about family and hobbies and what did you read lately, rather than what do you do for a living? You didn't ask that question. I do remember my parents stories of the gatherings at the lodge and this was usually the place where the Saturday night parties happened. There were skits and my dad was a rascal about that he was quite good about writing up skits that were good parodies. We played charades a lot in the family and he would get a absolutely goofy, and it was so in contrast to the professional man of the lab I totally enjoyed him on that part of it, he and mom both got the giggles and had a great time and they had some very good memories I know of parties. The women in particular had a very strong interrelationship and bonding. Your mom and dad weren't there when children were born because Los Alamos is closed and they weren't allowed to come in. So you did develop very strong relationships with your neighbors and those carried over I know my mom had lifelong friends after that I kind have duality as far as my recollections of her her main position and the way that she needed to be, specially early on, she was Miss Dr RE Schreiber, so she in a lot of ways was the social coordinator and social aspect of my grandfather and would also keep Paula and Sara in-line Theres very much the attitude, we cannot do this because your father is who he so especially as he started working his way up as head of the W Division, it was you need to act befitting the children of an Associate Director. We got a television soon as they were available in black and white, as children we werent allowed to turn on the TV and watch it by ourselves, it was evening and it was after dinner when it was on my neighbors on the other hand we could go over and watch Roy Rogers and Gene Autry shows on their television set. In the house, lots of reading, there was always reading, Dad would usually get us up on Sunday morning with some symphony on his stereo system that he had cranked up so we knew we werent going to stay in bed any longer, so culture was part of the environment always. My Grandma absolutely loved that every now and then and I say loved sarcastically there, that my grandfather would say so and so is coming into town on Friday we need to host em and this was Thursday afternoon late, so now my grandmother gets to completely re-organize the entire house, figure out how shes going to host these people which sometimes could have been another scientist, it could have been somebody from Washington, it could have been dignitary from another country, she got to deal with it sometimes a little begrudgingly she had a lot of good friends, the other wives would help out and pitch in as needed and they all kind of had a tight knit club, It was a kind of funny duality because my grandmother was kind of little bit more the rigid one on the exterior side because she very much wanted to make sure they had an image where my grandfather at the same time was much more laid back and casual about it was you know, well this just happens to be the job Im doing I'm not somebody special, it just happens to be where I've gotten, heres the entire hierarchy of nuclear physics as you know It today back then, it was. You know these are just the people who are working & they're working together and so theyre going to blow off steam together. He worked in Omega he and Perc King with Enrico Fermi doing the Water Boiler Experiments and I still dont know for sure what the Water Boiler is? I've seen it. New discoveries were being made everyday so on a Monday or Tuesday they would be learning about it because the theoreticians finally figured this part out and it was, this is the way we think it is, lets go prove it. It's amazing that the five of us didn't seem to think it particularly odd that we were being asked to build something we just heard of a few days before So when my Grandpa first got to Los Alamos one of the first projects he was on was the Water Boiler Project, code named to not give away what it really was but it did have meaning to it it became one of the first aqueous homogeneous reactions using Uranium. What we did. Was to keep adding Uranium to the solution as it became available, so we had the world's supply of separated U235 down in Omega, and this led to certain complications because it was a heavily guarded site you went out to the woods around there at your own risk because there were MPs stationed around this fence and there was at least one machine gun post. As it got further and further along they finally got to the point where they were predicting criticality. Guessing at how many grams it would go critical, I think we were we were all within 15 or 20 grams out of some 700. Fermi took the controls and almost on the exact spot where they predicted it was going to go critical, it went critical I remember my Grandpa making a comment on it really kind of awe inspiring this thing is living and breathing on its own self-sustaining reaction. Very early on. Very bleeding edge. Well there was always a problem of a few bugs here and there we hadnt realized that the solution would give off so called Radiolytic gas, there were also radioactive products being carried off, next thing was to run a copper tube up one of the tallest pine trees there and discharge the gas up there and hope that it would dissipate, well that didn't seem to work, as we found out because we were running the reactor and running around with radiation instruments to see what was happening and the instruments started going off the scale. So Fermi and I went outside as we got closer to this pipe that went up the tree the hotter it got, then we came back in, the instruments still read very high until we put them down and walked away from them. So we found out that we were contaminated, our clothes were contaminated. Fermi said "well now, that isnt too bad that's all short life stuff and it's soft, but Schreib you and I better go home and change our clothes and take a shower", so we did, I just hung the clothes in the closet, a couple of days later I got em out took em down and checked them and they were alright, little bit more casual about that then we are now They understood as healthy young men and a few women that they would otherwise be out fighting on the front lines somewhere that they were being protected from the risk of death in battle in order to perfect this new weapon of war, If they had to cut some corners take a little more radiation than might be best for them that they should go ahead and do so in the interests of potentially shortening the war and saving lives. Water Boiler had two purposes. Uranium is going to be used at least one atomic bomb and that bomb was Little Boy, and so if youre going to use Uranium or Plutonium in an atomic bomb you need to know what is the critical state is? That is, how much material you can amass before it blows itself apart, and so the purpose of the Water Boiler reactors of which there were three variations was to find out the critical mass of Uranium how much could be put together. About June, the decision was made that the Water Boiler should be rebuilt the first one could run possibly up to 100 watts if everybody stayed behind the wall because we had no shielding, and about the same time Marshall and Charlie and Don Kerst were reassigned to other jobs and it was left up to Perce King and myself Perce was the group leader and I was his deputy we were to then build this HYPO high-powered reactor along with designing the shielding and supervising all of this building primarily involving being down there everyday with old clothes on and I learned how to run an acetylene torch and burn out pieces of lead brick to fit around control rods and that sort of thing. Enrico Fermi was a very important figure in physics I think the main reason was because he was equally adept as a theoretician and an experimentalist he was competent with the theory of nuclear scattering and nuclear reactions and did a lot to develop the ideas behind how we understand the nucleus and he was also phenomenal as an experimentalist. Fermi would come down in the afternoons he was busy mornings with the more serious affairs of bomb design, but then the HYPO was his play thing so he would come down after lunch, call us in all around and say "what do we do today?" And then he would answer his own question because he knew exactly what he wanted to do, but then we would all go out and work in the shop if there was something to be built and then we would jointly operate the experiment It was a very meaningful learning process for me because he had almost phenomenal intuition for what things ought to be. If the answers didnt come up the way he thought they should be he would patiently go back and repeat the experiment and he was usually right It was very interesting to work with him. There was a terrible and almost devastating discovery made about Plutonium. Originally the laboratory was going to build one type of an atomic bomb what we know as Little Boy and it was going to shoot one piece of Uranium at a second piece or was going to shoot one piece of Plutonium at a second piece of Plutonium In the spring of 1944 all the Plutonium that had been used in measurements in Los Alamos up to that time had come from an linear accelerator, It was very different from the production Plutonium that began flowing from Hanford Washington where Plutonium in large amounts comparatively speaking meaning grams rather than micrograms was bombarded heavily inside of a reactor with neutrons when that happens you not only make the kind of Plutonium they wanted which was PU-239, but also PU-240, another isotope 241, yet another isotope 242 yet another isotope were so intensely fissionable that they tended to pre-detonate the gun-bomb that was designed to handle the Plutonium would have fired one piece up the barrel of the cannon but it would have actually melted down this was a disaster, Los Alamos was thinking they would only have one bomb by the end of the war and that had not been what their intention had been they spent the summer of 1944, everybody in the lab who was working on the Plutonium bomb was busy trying to think of alternatives, and what they came up with an idea for a whole new way of detonating fissionable materials that they called implosion. It Involved having a sphere of the Plutonium at the center of a large spherical weapon surrounded by some Uranium tamper to hold it together a little longer and then around that would be big blocks of high-explosive. To use high- explosives in such a precision manner because you would have to crush this ball of Plutonium symmetrically was a very iffy thing high-explosives have been used a little bit to sculpt Mount Rushmore but that was about the extent of the knowledge of using high-explosives, These separate blocks would bring the converging shock wave down to fit a little ball of Plutonium in the middle and actually squeeze it to twice its previous density, making it supercritical and setting off a chain reaction in the Plutonium so fast, that it didnt have time to pre-detonate so everything in the lab, the Uranium bomb was basically done, everybody in the lab turned to dealing with this new problem of inventing this new way of detonating nuclear weapons. Trinity first and foremost was simply going to see if high- explosives could be used to crush a ball of Plutonium. By February '45 the design for Fat Man was pretty much complete, but there was still a lot of anxiety about not only would it work but how well would it work and so there was a search for one across the country for a site to detonate what could be a very large bomb and it was decided to go to the Jornada Del Muerto in southern New Mexico. In March of 1945, the plans for the bomb test at Trinity and the overseas operation had been firmed up and Marshall asked me if I would join him in working under Bob Bacher for the field tests. If youre going to invent an entirely new way to detonate a weapon especially when its complicated as pieces of high- explosive that are shaping the charge in an entirely different direction and so forth, youre probably going to have to test this system and of course it was tested in various ways without a nuclear core, but ultimately the only test that was going to satisfy everyone was a test at full-yield. We'll the job was to get all the procedures and the instrumentation, the tools and so on worked out for the Alamogordo test the Trinity test and to set up identical kits to ship overseas they had to go out by ship to the Marianas Islands Tinian and there was a very tight time scale for that so we had top priority all over the place and my djob in particular was to assemble these kits and check out the tools and then we went on with the preparations for the Trinity test. No one was quite sure how much explosion you get out of this device and there was even a betting pool that was put together by the scientists ranging from zero to blows up the world, and everybody took a bet and put in some money You would choose a yield. In kilotons of what you thought the blast might be and the winner was a man by the name of Isidore Rabi II Rabi he was a Nobelist actually in physics from Columbia and he won not because he calculated anything but he got to Trinity late the train was delayed at Lamy, and he took the last number in the betting pool and his number was the closest to the actual yield. No one has ever seen such a thing before one of the physicists who was there I interviewed Philip Morrison said I was 10 miles away and it was as if someone had opened the door on an oven, thats how much heat was coming off the fireball even that far away. Teller put on sunscreen, sun lotion to protect against the sunburn and in fact Fermi anticipating the wind tore up small pieces of paper so when the blast wave or the wind passed by him he measured the lateral dispersion of the paper. So they built a tower about a hundred feet high out of steel and they put a shot cab as they came to be called a little cabin up on top where the bomb could be could sit and all the wiring and all the testing & everything else could be run off from that tower in every direction, out to bunkers that were built in the desert. Out farther to an old ranch that was used as an assembly site for the weapon. My grandfather was actually back at the McDonald ranch house which is where they did all the early assembly theres a few pictures of him around. The shot was getting ready storms are rolling in that night, and theyre afraid of electricity setting off the device, they actually left a poor guy up there to monitor the entire device in the electrical storm, as my grandpa put it he wasnt quite sure what he was supposed to do because lightning struck it he wasnt going to do anything, but they wanted somebody up there monitoring device anyway. General Groves running around insisting that the weather change he was after all a General in the Army and he ordered the weather to change dammit the weather should change and it did! My grandpa had my grandma pack lunches for him and said OK were going to run some more tests, didn't say anything beyond that my grandma that point in time also knew not to ask because my grandpa wasn't going to say. Oppenheimer at that point down to 115 pounds, this man of six feet one inches in height, from a bout of Chickenpox over the last two weeks, leaning against the "I must stay conscious, I must stay conscious", worried that his weapon wouldn't work, they pushed the button and it worked. At the five minute warning we were supposed to lie down, and we had to keep our heads covered turned away from the blast, and the light of course that was the longest five-minutes I ever went through in my life, we could see some eleven miles away where the tower was the light that was on top of the tower just a little tiny candle flame essentially, and then all of a sudden the whole world was lighted up very brilliantly, I had some welders goggles which I put on and turned to look at the blast and the fireball had faded enough that the welders goggles we're too faint, so I snatched them off and then it was too bright for my eyes didn't blind me accept momentarily as a bright light would, and then after long time why here came the sound of the bomb itself, which was more concussion than any noise and wasn't half as impressive as the light, but we certainly knew something had happened. A lot of people in town actually knew about it, not necessarily exactly what was going to happen some of the scientists and told her wives okay on this such a date, this time roughly, you might want to go over here and look this direction, we'll that's wasn't my grandpa's style. And we came home later that day of course we were forbidden to tell anyone what had happened except by the time we got back here, everybody at the site practically including the wives knew something had happened. The night that the test went off my grandma was sleeping soundly because she wasn't told to go out, and all her neighbors, everyone else up on a mountain looking the correct direction and the next day through the wives clubs & whatnot hear chatter of did you see this did you see that? And my grandma was a little at a time, perturbed to my grandpa of "why didn't you tell me?" If it was secret he kept it secret and thats the way it was, don't bother asking. Trinity while it was a big deal and a consumed a lot of time and energy, it came and went quickly, and the people at the laboratory had to move on because the bigger mission was to build the combat bombs. Admiral Nimitz recently pointed out at Okinawa that the Pacific forces welcome the help of United States airmen employed in Europe, they know it will require months to shift Yank power across the Atlantic. The materials for the Uranium core for the Little Boy bomb was delivered by ship, Groves did not want to lose these cores so he preferred to deliver them by ship thinking that a plane would be a riskier way to carry these billion dollar pieces of metal to this little island where they were going to be assembled into the weapon. But there really wasn't time with the Pu core, it was delivered just a couple days before it was actually used and therefore had to be delivered by plane and Schreib was the one who carried the thing out. I was picked for that job by a flip of a quarter, Boyce McDaniel and I we're both logical candidates for the position Marshall wasn't willing to make the choice and either was Bob Bacher, so we finally flipped a coin and I won. Tinian is one of the islands in the Marianas group in the central Pacific very hot, very humid, lots of jungle, it was a big air base being used by the 20th Air Force to bomb Japan. Ordered enough GI clothes to wear out there because we went out as pseudo officers civilians working with the military. Combat troops are very quick to point out people who who don't fight and so for people like Schreiber and others who were there they were seen as a special class of citizen they were getting some special treatment but worst of all they weren't really fighting, and so people really did wonder what their value was to the war effort. Some security officers came by the house with a GI car waited while I told Marge goodbye and off we went driving to Albuquerque, the convoy included the core for the bomb, and I was the quote technical courier for the bomb we drove to Albuquerque and got on the train the three of us together with the little case that carried the core got out to Oakland and met with the automobiles and taken to the base where I was told to go into the ditching briefing where you were told what you were supposed to do if the plane had to go down and I was right in the middle of it when somebody tapped me on the shoulder and said come on we're going, so we got on the airplane and we started out. He stuck the core in the back of plane and went up front with the crew which evidently made the crew rather nervous asked him to go back and strap it down back there in case it rolled around, it would not have done anything it was subcritical, but but he did. I was met by the usual crew of MP's we had our Quonset which was air conditioned for our workshop and this was two or three miles away from camp toward the airfield and that was in another heavily guarded compound, we'll it was nice to have air conditioning in fact we became quite popular with the rest of the crew that was out there Los Alamos because I think there were only two such places and the other one had the high-explosives in it so people weren't quite as happy sitting there as they were in our cozy quarters. We'll the first operation was Little Boy the gun type assembly and I had nothing to do with that work, there was a whole separate crew which took care of putting that one together. The plane took off alright and the drop was made on Hiroshima, we were so remote from the explosion that it was a little hard to realize the tragic loss of life which actually occurred, one of the greatest damages was due to the fact that the city was just built out of paper and bamboo and the intense heat from the bomb started a firestorm which swept across the city. Most of the damage from atomic bombs about 95+ percent comes from explosive force, when they were looking at where to drop an atomic bomb and then how to drop an atomic bomb one of the issues became at what altitude and so ideally to maximize he destructive portion of the atomic bomb you would detonate it at some number feet above ground in this case it was about 1800 feet plus or minus 100 feet, it also helps to minimize the amount of radiation and amount of residual radiation that you get, so if you explode something close to the ground, and the explosion and entrains dirt, steel, concrete, whatever, it can irradiate some of those materials and make them radioactive and so you would have an environmental wasteland if you will and so one of the benefits and its a marginal benefit I think is that if you detonate an a atomic bomb at altitude you don't get the environmental damage you would if it were detonated closer to the to the ground. Then we waited to see if anything would happen, I believe thats when the ultimatum was sent out for Japan to surrender in fact there had been surrender leaflets dropped, while nothing did happen and so on August 9th Fatman was dropped and we had gone to work assembling our part of the bomb, that is the core and capsule that fitted into the high-explosives. A fairly complicated process, you have a little half-piece of the Plutonium Core and the little initiator thats put very carefully in the hole in the middle, and the next piece of Plutonium on top, then the tamper of Uranium which is in several pieces, and you're working down inside this huge explosive lens system which is about 4 or 5 feet in diameter with these huge blocks of waxy high-explosive around it, and you're reaching over down into it hooking things together putting pieces in, someone who assembled the weapon. It might have been Schreiber I don't recall remembered that when the thing was supposedly finished he noticed that some of the wires were reversed and stayed up all night reversing them back the way they were supposed to be or the thing might not have worked at all, and it was General Groves horror that the bomb might not work, the material would land on the ground and the Japanese would sweep it all up and use it to make a bomb themselves, not a very likely scenario but General Groves worried a lot about making sure these things actually worked when and how they were supposed to work. This plane had a target which was obscured by clouds and they picked Nagasaki as a secondary target we're a little low on gas when they dropped the bomb they made it back to Iwo Jima refueled there and then returned back to Tinian later that afternoon surrender was finally arranged and we thought we thought we would of come home, generals decided that we would have to stay there until Japan was occupied so we did stay there until first week in September and we finally given orders to return home, and they were busily making another core back here in Los Alamos and it could have delivered out there if there had been any hanky-panky about a fake surrender. This was not only the blockade, but it was the invasion force, almost every single ship was a landing craft landing ship there was thousands upon thousands of people that were getting ready to invade, he knew his job was to stop this, the very specific action that he's helping out with has to work, they wanted to end the war and as quickly as they could. Harold Agnew who helped build atomic bomb, flew the Hiroshima mission and later became a director here Los Alamos says that the hospital facilities being built on Tinian and Saipan were massive, they were anticipating casualties far beyond what we had seen and so had we invaded Japan rather than drop the atomic bombs there would have been a lot of deaths on both sides and it would have been a horrific scene with no good outcome for anybody. One of the things which I've always remembered when people ask me, "we'll you know, wasn't this a terrible thing to do and don't you regret awfully having been involved", and so on, is one morning I got up and was walking around the camp and looked out on the leeward side of the island and all I could see were landing craft from clear out to the horizon, these were landing craft that were being worked up the coast along the Mariana Islands for the invasion of Japan, because that was the plan which was the backup in case the bombs did not get delivered, or they didn't work as promised and when you stop to consider how many hundreds of thousands of troops that would of been involved in that sort of an operation, what sort of massacre there would of been on both sides, they would of had to make an amphibious landing, and I think that there was a net saving of both Japanese and American lives by dropping the bomb. We're just told that Wednesday & Thursday have been declared legal, federal holidays VJ. Day, maybe you can hear the people screaming down there ladies and gentlemen let's give a listen... I think they're will always questions, strong opinions about the use of the atomic bombs during World War II, by the summer of 1945, in total had claimed about 70M lives, if you figure that World War II started as early as 1932 in China and certainly in the 30's with Nazi Germany by the time 1945 the war was over 10 years old and in a war that killed 70 million people it was time for it to end, and the atomic bomb certainly did that. The Japanese Emperor having been apprised of what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, did an absolutely historically unique thing he stepped out of his role as the spiritual leader of the country into politics he said a new and most terrible weapon of war has forced us to think the unthinkable and asked his people to lay down their arms which remarkably enough they did with very little debate. All we can see is a sea of humanity people in every color costume people from all the nations of world have assembled here today to celebrate this truly great victory over the Japanese. The war was over I'd returned from Tinian and the place was in a fair turmoil there was another group of senior personnel who were much concerned about the laboratory and they stayed on to help plan a strategy for whatever was to come at this time Oppenheimer resigned to return to academic career and Norris Bradbury was selected to replace him. Bradbury just ended up sending out a message to everyone saying its time to make the decision if your'e going to leave leave but if you're going to stay stay so we can start actually figuring out who's here what we have to work with and start going forward. There was of course, a great deal of uncertainty on the civilians who had been brought in for the duration and there were about 2000 GI's all they wanted to do was to get out, not to mention all the housewives and families that didn't know if they should pack up and get ready to move or what was to happen. Bradbury develops this philosophy that the laboratory would become a scientific laboratory he changes the name from its wartime designation which is basically just Los Alamos. He undertakes programs and basic science and weapons work. He makes it a meaningful place for scientists to come and practice their craft and many and Schreib is one of these that does stay and makes a major contribution, The war was over, mission accomplished, what next Schreib comes to Los Alamos during the war as a relatively junior scientist but at the end of the war he becomes a senior scientist he becomes one of those people who stays who takes on management responsibilities who's responsible for providing scientific leadership and he along with Bradbury for whom he develops a very close relationship over the years really do save the laboratory intellectually after the war. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen we're speaking to you from the site of the laboratory of the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos New Mexico where in a moment we'll bring you the ceremonies of the Army-Navy E Award Colonel Kenneth B Nichols will act as ceremonies for the afternoon. Dr. Oppenheimer was giving his speech everybody was gathered on the lawn at Fuller Lodge I was in the car with my parents listening to the speech and at some point I moved from my mothers lap to my fathers lap and then I sat on the horn, it was recorded it was recorded on the radio, my mom wrote a letter to her parents and told them that I had had achieved posterity because I in fact, had been recorded and they had heard the horn on the radio broadcast. My sister was almost 3 at that point I was a year old and it was much more important for her to see him and of course my mother, she was just grinning from ear-to-ear My sister was my best friend my mentor she was very significant part of my life all the time, we were enough different that we didn't actually compete for people or attention at all we got along quite well, she was a very delightful person to grow up with and she took good care of me. A Lot of scientists started packing up and leaving going back to the different colleges the colleges needed them to teach. Dr, Lark Harovitz called me several times and urged me to come back to Purdue, Marge and I talked about this and we just decided that was going to be a pretty dull life, so we turned him off. My grandfather already had his PhD really liked the area and decided at least for a short term to stick around. I went and talked to Bob Bacher who was my division leader and he said we'll what are they offering you and I told him he says we'll we'll match that offer if you'll stay, and I think it was in that winter when all the pipes froze up, the captain in charge of the water supply threatened to shoot himself if it froze again, but it froze again but he didn't shoot himself, then in January of '46 Norris got a letter from General Groves which essentially said hold everything together as best you can, we're going to plan to do something about the water do something about the houses, you should plan to continue at least for the next several years, and then it was about in February of that year that the Navy decided to hold a test of the effects of Nuclear bombs on Navy vessels. The joint chiefs of staff approved the code name suggested by Admiral Blandy and the venture was christened Operation Crossroads. With so little Plutonium and Uranium available for the first bombs, the scientist had to devise ways to see if they would work the way they thought they would work but without actually blowing them up, the way they did that was basically to surround a bomb core with stacks of material that would reflect neutrons coming from the bomb core back into the core and increase the chain reaction, if theres enough material it's basically infinite in which case the material blows up if there's not enough material the chain reaction fizzles out at some point along the way and slowly dies down so because of this two different facts it's possible to determine whether you have the right sized bomb core. It's a tricky business, one version of this kind of testing the physicist Richard Feynman called it, tickling the tail of a Dragon, because of course if you get things wrong you can actually start a chain reaction going so fast that it's very difficult to stop it. Then it goes supercritical, you get high levels of radiation that's not the soft radiation, its not alpha you're talking beta, you're talking gamma, it's the stuff that will kill you, they also tried to keep it away from the general population so if it did happen nobody else was going to get injured from it. Only twice in the course of those years did it actually happen where someone was actually fatally irradiated in the process, once just at the end of the war and then after the war at a rather famous or notorious event when Louis Slotin who loved to do these bomb core tests, because they were tickling the Dragons tail they had the breath of danger on them. The upper part of that reflector shell slammed shut around that critical assembly and caused it to become supercritical, what you have is a runaway chain reaction that just produces huge numbers, you know billions of of Neutrons almost instantaneously, faster than a human being can react within a millisecond there many generations of neutrons that have evolved in this assembly and the neutron population is huge, and this manifests itself in some interesting physical phenomena that you really don't see unless you're in real trouble, for example theres a flash of light as the air is ionized, these neutrons run out into the air and and hit things and and cause them to become radioactive and so the counters in the room all of the radiation detectors just go wild you have heat from the release of this nuclear energy its a phenomenon that very few people experience and and those who do tend to have serious health problems or in the case of Louis Slotin you know, a fatal bout with radiation illness, I think he was actually probably fully aware of the dangers and and yet probably felt a little too safe because he had done it many times before, had done it successfully. Enrico Fermi was so concerned about Slotin's testing that whenever there was a criticality test going on Fermi would move his entire team to another building far away so that if something happened he wouldn't be there to be irradiated with Slotin so he was indeed concerned about this guy in the way he was running these tests. I was down at Parjito site checking things out at the time of the Slotin accident He was testing to be sure it was working properly with a setup of materials around it And while I as not a participant at all in the experiment which led to this I was in the room and this of course led to Louis Slotin's death and Al Graves having a very heavy dosage of radiation from which he recovered. He was holding the two pieces of the core apart, and the pieces fell together and there was a burst of blue light in the room, irradiated everyone including Schreib. When the screwdriver slipped Slotin's instant reaction was to break the pieces apart so he reached over with his bare hands of course which also increased his exposure. There was enough tamper around it reflecting neutrons in that it started a chain reaction. And I was stuck in the hospital for two days I think while observing me, and finally decided that there was nothing wrong, I had been far enough away that I only got about 25R of exposure. They got a pretty good dose although nobody was was seriously affected most of the people in the room except for poor Slotin lived to a ripe old age Slotin however was fatally irradiated and died a slow and rather agonizing death over the next 8 days. We were there, knowing how he and my mother interacted he probably said something about, theres been an accident, I need to change of clothes, you cant get close to me, I'm going to the hospital and I think everything's going to be fine and that was probably pretty much the conversation, she had to find Harriet Holloway probably to take care the kids so she can go, but she couldn't get to dad because he was radioactive and so they weren't letting the family close, and I get this from what my dad wrote not from what he said, that Louie was a very bright physicist and really his loss was significant because he had a lot to contribute, but he didn't do it he didn't play by the rules entirely and it cost him. The accident itself plus the evaluations that Schreib and others conducted led to remote handling of nuclear materials, and this is really the beginning of formal safety practices dealing with critical materials here at the laboratory, and we go to remote handling the use of televisions and just staying away from the stuff, being able to to say if there's an accident it won't kill anybody but certainly Schreib's work in the accident contributed mightily to moving to that regime. At the 50th anniversary we went down there with my grandfather to visit around Parijito site and went out and saw some of the Kivas, well you could see him from a distance you couldn't actually get into him because they were being used and she was asked multiple questions one of them about going into building one well, after a little bit of calm my grandfather decided yes, under the requirements of while he was in there, no questions are asked, no films taken, he would go in there and say whatever he wanted to say but I think the really the only reason why I agreed to it was because myself and my mother was there, so we went in it was a very solemn occasion it was kind of eerie in ways so my grandfather pointed out where, where he was roughly, where he was standing, where the table was. I think a couple of benches were actually still in there from around that time, it was calm and surreal, you can tell it had an effect on my grandfather, we got out of the building there was a few people asking if he thought that that was a really reckless thing to do he got very taunt very short with his response and you could tell it set him off, this was a friend, it was a guy that he worked with his not going to say he wasn't reckless, he was doing things he shouldn't have done the way, my grandfather put it was it was a stupid act, somebody died you had to say was stupid but to criticize a co-worker and a criticize somebody that's now dead that was ground he didn't want to tread on unfortunately its also the thing that almost everyone interviewed my grandpa wanted to know so it became kind of a bit of sore subject for him, it was something that yes it happened, it was a mistake, we learned from it, we've moved on, we completely redid everything for to keep everyone else safe not just Los Alamos but everyplace that did critical assemblies. I was at lunch one day with Schreib talked about the accident with tears in his eyes he felt badly about it, he felt that Slotin I think had gotten kind of a raw deal over the years he very much respected him and the accident and the outcome troubled him many many years later The decision had been made that we we're going to keep the laboratory going, we we're to develop new bombs and there was going to be a nuclear bomb stockpiling effort by the laboratory. These two men Schreib and Bradbury were in many ways very similar men, you know they were both experimental physicists and people who haven't been around physicists possibly don't realize how different theoretical physicist are the ones do the calculations from the guys who actually do the hands-on experiments on the lab bench or in the field. Experimentalists a totally different breed as far as Ive been able to tell often politically more conservative strangely enough, they tend to be intensely practical people they've learned to think clearly about how you manipulate objects to make a certain outcome occur, whereas theoreticians are often into literature and art, often politically quite liberal, Robert Oppenheimer was perhaps an extreme example but he was a rather neurotic man, a chain smoker troubled in some ways, troubled certainly about who he was, you never had a sense with Bradbury or Schreib that they ever had any doubt about who they were and what their place was in the world and how they went about doing their work. In the fall of '47 Holloway asked me if I would like to come up and work in the division offices as an associate division leader because I was quite interested in the overall work of the division and was showing some signs of interest in organization and management. Schreib and Norris Bradbury were kindred spirits similar training, similar education, and they meshed well they worked well together, they were both nose-to-the-grindstone let's make the laboratory work, lets advance the science and technology, they weren't politicians Bradbury could run the laboratory from his directors slot, he could take care of the overall picture, as Technical Associate Director. Schreiber could handle all the technical details he could look at individual programs and analyze them for what they were in there worth technically. He ended up being in charge of the W Division the cores the criticality experiments the high explosive sides of it, the chemistry side of it. As well as metallurgy side of it everything that was the entire weapons program. It's said of Oppenheimer that he built the laboratory, but it's said of Bradbury that he made the laboratory of permanent entity, and certainly if that's true Schreiber was Bradbury's right right hand man making that so. A crucial change that came in '48 was what was called levitation, the first bomb had a solid ball of Plutonium, actually two hemispheres at the center of a massive assembly of high explosives and the high explosives squeezed that ball to double its previous density and about half it's previous size, they made an air gap from between the ball and the explosives so that the explosive shockwave had time to accelerate before it hit the core and therefore could hit it a lot harder that meant for example that you could make a smaller core, you didn't need as much Plutonium if you could hit it harder because you could squeeze it to a greater density than the other system, so when Schreib and the others developed this first generation of levitated cores they basically doubled the United States of supply of bombs you could make a bomb with half the material you made the previous bomb with that you could double the number of bombs, this turned out to be very important because in August of 1949 the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb which was a carbon copy gotten from espionage in Los Alamos during the War, I interviewed some of the Soviet scientists who worked on those first weapons, they said, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, that by 1947 they had already figured out a levitated design and had a design for a weapon that would have been twice the yield and half the weight of the Fatman bomb and then I said so why didn't you use it in your tests? And they said well are bomb program was run by the notorious KGB guy Lavrenti Beria who was notorious for being a brute. And he told them when they took their levitated core design to him in '47, comrades I don't care about you or damn design. I want the American bomb, we know it works give me the American bomb or I will turn you into camp dust, meaning he would send them off to the gulag, the leader of the Soviet program told me after the end of the Soviet Union in '92, he said we were concerned for our families and our children and each other and we gave Beria the weapon that he wanted, but the 2nd Soviet test a year later was of a weapon that was half the weight, and twice the yield as the Fatman bomb so clearly they moved on to levitated weapons by then of course Schreib and his team had already done the same thing and doubled the US arsenal and then when the Soviets tested their first bomb we already understood that we had an answer to that if you believe that there's such a thing as deterrence and certainly at some level the fact that a country that's your enemy has nuclear weapons would certainly deter you from deciding to attack them without a good deal of thought at least and of course, there never was a war between the United States and the Soviet Union probably for exactly that reason, nevertheless there was a great hurrying and scurrying in Washington among the politicians about what are we going to do? What are we going to do? The Russians have the bomb shouldn't we go for a hydrogen bomb, what should we do? What should we do? And the calm answer from people like Schreib and Robert Oppenheimer and others was look we've got a lot more atomic bombs than they do, a lot more fission weapons than they do and were turning them out at a great rate now we've got the reactors going in Washington where were making good bombs they're reliable off-the-shelf wooden bombs, now hold your horses as Oppenheimer said to Teller hold your horses, keep your shirt on. Bikini Atoll a dot on the map in the mid Pacific was destined to become a focal point for the eyes of the world. There was discussion among some politicians and military people about further demonstrating the destructive capacity of atomic bombs, and it was a little bit of a controversy particularly here at Los Alamos because Bradbury among others thought that Hiroshima and Nagasaki, provided more than ample proof about the destructive capability of atomic bombs, but the military particularly the Navy wanted to test the atomic bombs against ships. The summer of '46 the Navy assembled what remained of the Japanese battle fleet, there was the German cruiser the Prinz Eugen and then a number of United States warships that were becoming obsolete, and they sailed all these ships into Bikini Lagoon in the Marshall Islands and detonated two atomic bombs to test the effects. There was actually three, so there was going a be a deep water shot, a shallow water shot and then airburst shot, the airburst was going to be another almost exactly like a Fatman shot, then there was going to be the deep water which was going to be about a mile down and they we're going to try and do a shallow water they ended up only doing the shallow and the air burst because they couldn't quite figure out how to anchor it down low to be actually get data from it, and they don't want to just blow something up and not get data from it. Schreib had kind of an interesting part in Crossroads, he was again a courier as he had been for the Nagasaki bomb. We got an Army knapsack, it's one I still carry around for hauling rocks and that sort of thing and stuffed the carrying case in it. He was carrying at least one of the cores again like he'd done over to Tinian the boats we're pitching around in water and as they were getting ready for the shot and he's bringing the core with him and all the sudden he gets grabbed by one of the military officers he hands a rope down and tells him to tie it off, and at first grandpa was a little ike "tie what off?", the officer said tie the knapsack you can go into the water but I don't want that going into the water. The Albemarle was converted into the bomb carrying and assembly vessel. They had to find a way to both keep the Plutonium secure and secret and protecting anybody from knowing what it is, so they made a big deal about putting backpacks in bolted strong boxes on the ships deck and then they surrounded the strong boxes with a company of soldiers with rifles and machine guns and made a big deal about protecting it, but the truth is that the real backpack was taken below put on a bunk and one of the one of the army guys quarters and Schreib slept with it all the way out to Bikini. The Plutonium Core was actually in a stateroom next to my stateroom with our local MP security officers living with it I went in everyday or so to pat it take it's temperature and sniff around I don't know what I would done if anything had gone wrong and I had to go through the act. He was responsible at Bikini for building the two bombs that were used they were codenamed Able and Baker. My assembly crew, Neil Davis and Roy Thompson, Ted Perlman and Harold Hammel was my team, we'll they'd gotten out there beforehand and had our little laboratory all set up we had our own private Marine guard in front of the door people we're only let in on showing their badge identifying themselves. Modifications to prepare a Daves Dream for the bomb were made by technicians assigned by Manhattan Engineer District. In due course, we then had the time for the loading of the aircraft went through all of the assembly procedures offloaded the assembled bomb onto the pier and it was trundled away on it's trailer behind a truck and loaded into the B-29 which was to drop it. The laboratory unit of this group delivered the first bomb to the crew of the plane a minimum period before takeoff, two-weaponers were assigned to ride in the plane and arm the bomb after the aircraft was a safe distance from Kwajalein, all was ready for Able Day and at eight-forty nine, Admiral Blandy signals for the start of the bombing run, on the cry "bomb away" the world's 4th atomic bomb plummets earthward about five-hundred feet above the surface of the lagoon the bomb explodes. Well the bomb is dropped unfortunately the bombardier missed the center of the target array by about 1500 feet and then a few days after everything settled down again we disembarked from Kwajalein and went down and anchored in the Bikini Lagoon outside the target array for the underwater test they had a landing barge which had been specially adapted, what they had done is cut right down through the hull and put in a well and suspended it underneath this landing craft and I have a series of shots that I took in 35 millimeter slides of that bomb blast, I got up on the searchlight platform and we could hear the countdown, so at zero I just started shooting pictures as fast as I could and I got about eight or ten before the cloud chamber effect obscured the whole target array one.... fire... Then over the next few days we were able to go and take a small boat and go around and see what happened. Of course, the effects as Bradbury predicted were the same, theres no defense against atomic bombs ships are never rugged enough and if you don't sink him you make them radioactive so that the crews can't survive or sail them. We had something like 10 days to 2 weeks just to loaf around It's a pretty humdrum existence there was an editor from all places the canning & food freezing magazine who was invited out as part of the press contingent and he basically was bored to death, and I think that epitomizes sort of the life at Bikini was you had several seconds of intense excitement as these bombs went off and you saw the mushroom clouds, but the day-to-day life was pretty tedious you could swim you could read maybe watch a movie on the ships deck of it didn't rain, you can drink a little beer but beyond that it was pretty humdrum and fairly tedious. We did an awful lot of sunning & we also went off on junkets and it was very annoying that the smoking lamp was out about half the time aboard ship, we finally learned to take care of that situation by retiring to our laboratory where not even the ships captain could come and having our smokes there and we returned on the Able Mable blessed captain decided he was going to make an economy run and so we chugged along I think it took us twelve days to come back at 10 knots and it was awfully dull. He not knowing it probably not really appreciating it and in knowing Schreib not putting much stock in it, he probably and I think in all reality, the summer of '45-'46 he was one of the three most important people in the world when it came to atomic bombs, not even the Soviets had a Schreiber who could to build an atomic bomb at that point. The time is ten forty-seven, this is a Conelrad radio alert normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period. Ladies and gentlemen you've heard the reports of enemy planes are approaching in less than 3 hours an H Bomb might fall over Portland. Edward Teller a Hungarian-American scientist who had come up with the idea of a hydrogen weapon in 1941 talking with the great Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. Teller was one of those people that chafed at what he called pedestrian work during World War II He was originally in charge of the Theoretical Division but he didn't like it he felt like developing the atomic bomb was a done deal certainly theres a lot of work to do he never denied that but he knew it was a done deal and his mind was fertile enough and active enough that he was looking for the next challenge. And so Oppenheimer rather wisely decided, well alright if Edward wants to work on the Hydrogen bomb were going to work on that someday, so let him get started and he turned Teller over to that task rather than the task of doing some of the very complicated mathematics that had to be done one of the outcomes of that decision was that Oppenheimer was short on mathematicians who could do calculations, that's what they substituted in those days for the computers, that did not yet exist and called on the British to send over their team to supplement the calculating team in Los Alamos among the people in the British team was one of the Soviet spies Klaus Fuchs so it's possible to blame Teller to some degree for the appearance in Los Alamos of Klaus Fuchs. The ring was first uncovered following the arrest of Klaus Fuchs in England Greenglass Mrs Rosenberg's brother confessed theft of the secrets while stationed at the Los Alamos atomic project. Teller acquired a small team to help him including a Polish mathematician of great gifts whose name was Stanislaw Ulam Stan Ulam a bit reluctantly joined in working with Teller the two men really did not get along they were very different personality types nevertheless they worked together on this problem and then the question as I said came up of whether or not the United States should start a crash program to build a Hydrogen bomb and the Oppenheimer lead committee of the Atomic Energy Commission voted no! Teller and his rather politically conservative friends were immensely incensed decided that someone was trying to let the Soviets get a head of us. There's a lot of emotions that started running high about that time. Teller notoriously said in his distinctive Hungarian a accent "if we don't build a Hydrogen bomb, I will be prisoner of the Soviet Union in the United States within five years", thats an amazing thing for someone to say but I think Teller had a longstanding fear of the Russian colossus that played into his sense and remember the Hydrogen bomb in his mind was his idea. We were very much in the Cold War and the arms race at that point, there was a lot of consternation including Teller pretty much stomping out in the laboratory, going over to Lawrence Livermore to continue developing it instead of being at the lab. When the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb, the scientific advisory committee to the Atomic Energy Commission met in an important meeting in October of 1949 and basically said we don't know how to build a Hydrogen bomb yet, if you want us to go that route there are some reasons why its not a good idea we do know how to build smaller, lighter weight, more efficient atomic bombs, so we think we should do what we're already doing because President Truman ordered us to do this last summer which is increase the production of fission weapons that should be our response to the Soviet development of a fission weapon of it's own. There had been debates going on in the upper circles for sometime about the possibility of building a Hydrogen bomb so called and finally there was the top level decision that the laboratory should go into an all out effort to develop this if it could be developed and this decision was made I believe in November of 1950. Up to now the laboratory has had sufficient time to compile information and revise weapon design before a field test of the weapon as of now the situation has changed we must take risks calculated risks is true but risks nevertheless. Almost immediately went onto a six day work week a year to the day of the decision to start, we made the first test, of the so called Mike shot. Unlike Little Boy and Fatman Mike was about 80 tons had this liquid fuel that had to be maintained at extraordinary low temperatures in hot humid Pacific where was tested and it stood about three or four stories tall so it was it was not a weapon of war it was certainly a bomb but it was not a weapon of war. We'll Marshall was chosen by Norris Bradbury to take charge of that whole operation and he had essentially top priority on all of the laboratory facilities and personal I was put in as acting N Division leader our job there was to follow up with the experimental work the design and fabrication of the test devices but we we're supposed to be following up with some reasonable designs which could actually be used and shoehorned into an airplane. When then everything was shipped out to Enewetak they were testing everything out in the last days before the thing was going to be exploded he discovered that the core that was used in this really hot atomic bomb might have a tendency to pre-detonate, which would mean it would melt down instead of exploding properly and the whole test would be wasted and this was a big test, I mean this was a tank of Deuterium with gallons and gallons of a material that previously in been made by the gram, this was really a heroic test that was involved so Schreib took the responsibility the night before the test of changing out the core, for another core that they knew was reliable so that he was quite confident that it wouldn't pre-detonate thats the kind of thing that sounds easy to do but if you think about it the risk that he had to take in terms of his personal responsibility, his confidence, in his numbers, his confidence in the physics of what he was doing it probably required all those previous years of work that he had done, intimate hands on work for him to be prepared to make such a momentous decision. I was out for the Mike shot and it was truly impressive we were about 30 miles away on a ship and it still scared the hell out of me when it went off The previous explosions were large, but the Mike shot was awe inspiring, as he put it it truly defined the word awesome as how big the shot was, kept on going and going and going We'll this successful test brought on another flurry of activity to develop stockpileable devices, and over the next 18 months there were about 5 or 6 different variations designed and tested, the interesting thing was they all worked including some that were regarded as being of very marginal design on a theoretical basis. So all of that was going on the lab was thriving they were recruiting young scientist to come work there they were turning out bombs and fast, we were turning on bombs by the thousands the United States by the height of the Cold War had some 40,000 Hydrogen and Uranium and Plutonium weapons in its storehouses and the Soviet Union which always cranked out more than it needed had some 75,000 enough to destroy the world many times over, I'm happy to say were now down to about a total in the world of about 13,000 still enough to destroy the world many times over but perhaps not as many times as in the 1980's With the extraordinary ingenuity and real genius that was involved in taking a physical reaction discovered on a bench top in Nazi Germany in 1938, and turning it into this whole new field of energy, for power, for medicine for all sorts of humane uses, but also for terrible weapons, it's easy to shrug and say those were terrible things we should of never of done that, as an historian I feel that it's real Monday morning quarterbacking to look back on the past and say, those people shouldn't have done that, they were not nice people, I think instead the way to think about the past had its own principles and rules and it's own challenges and fears One has to say why? Why did they do that? What was it that lead them to make the decisions they made, what can we learn from what they did and what they thought and what they said about what they did, all of that is part of what we call history and it's much more helpful I think to us now, looking at the future were looking forward to to try to understand what happened not simply to condemn them out of hand and say, well we wouldn't have done that were better people than that Would we not have? What would we have done? They're are really two applications for nuclear energy, one of course is atomic bombs or Hydrogen bombs, but the second is power production you can produce a whole lot of power that you can use to drive machines or Industries, the electrical industry for instance with the nuclear energy, It can also be used for propulsive power & so in the late 50's there was a lot of interest at the laboratory and developing power systems and so the laboratory inaugurated what became project ROVER, which was to use nuclear power to drive space rockets for interstellar flight. My grandfather was getting tired of being on the weapons side and he was given the ability to rise a little further up, start get a little more of the culture of the lab that was when the Rover project started coming on. The moon, closest neighbor to earth, presently the focus of man's greatest scientific adventure, landing men on the moon will be a truly great achievement but only the beginning of a new era in space exploration, no one can predict the exact missions that will follow in the years and decades ahead, but the most exciting possibilities will require the acceleration and deceleration of very heavy loads nuclear rockets when perfected, can provide the same propulsion energy, with less overall weight they will expand our ability to explore space this is the story. During the space race in the 60s and early 70's through Dr Schreiber's work at Los Alamos a tremendous amount of work was done to develop these nuclear thermal rockets and they were almost ready to go, if they're had been a Mars mission, I have a great degree of confidence that they would have been involved in that architecture. In early '55 when Darol who was then the associate Director came around one evening and says how would you like to get together a small group to see if you can build a nuclear rocket, we'll I knew nothing about nuclear rockets I knew there had been a study committee set up and I even sat in on a few of those, frankly, I didn't think the thing could be made to work at the time, but I said sure I'll give it a whirl. We tend to live in a world that's dominated by energy that's available from the Sun, most of our chemical energy comes indirectly from the Sun, our wind power, solar power come from the Sun when we burn coal we're burning the remains of plants that grew from photosynthesis millions of years ago, but were still using an energy source thats dependent on the sun. Nothing humans have discovered up into this point can match the energy density contained in the binding of nucleons the the atomic energy locked in the nucleus of literally all of the atoms around us. Why is the nuclear rocket so much better than the chemical rocket? It's lightweight, high-velocity exhaust will use propellant about twice as efficiently as chemical rockets. The less material you have to take up in the form of traditional chemical propulsion the farther you can go, the less expensive, and for some applications nuclear power is all we've got basically, deep space missions traditionally rely on a technology known as an RTG or Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, and those have powered our deep space probes, our Pioneer, our Voyager, the Mars Curiosity Rover for example has a very large Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators on-board, but if were going to go and were going to take humans and were going to go farther with more payload, we need to improve the technology, solar and chemical while they are good technologies for certain places, the farther you get away the less effective or not effective at all, they become. We were given any amount of money that we wanted and I was asked well how much money will it take for construction to build a test site and build any additional structures we needed here and I guessed maybe 10 million, and Norris said you really don't know so let's ask for 15, Louie Strauss says we'll let's put you down for 25 million and that ought to run you for awhile, so different from now that it seems unreal and finally it was resolved yes indeed we would go we LASL would go ahead with the nuclear rocket this was all done in complete secrecy even the fact the program was going was a secret, It was January of '57 before we really got going. It was pursued simultaneously with other elements of Kennedy's vision for space which included putting a person on the moon, some of this was motivated by the space race with the Soviet Union, some of it was motivated by Kennedy's vision for a technocracy a society that was really you know developed on a firm foundation of science and technology. The purpose of President Kennedy's visit to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory was a briefing on the details of project ROVER the laboratories program to develop nuclear rocket engines for space travel President John F Kennedy the first President of the United States to visit Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory has arrived, Dr Norris E Bradbury Laboratory, Director Dr Raemer Schreiber, Associate Director, Mr Charles C. Campbell, AEC manager of the Los Alamos area office and other officials met the visitors as they arrived. Grandpa had a little of a downside that Bradbury and President Kennedy and a couple others talking about budget it ended up rather than a big presentation and ended up being, okay here's the rocket here's what it does, here's how we do it, and a quick overview and then the next thing you know President Kennedys heading out the door waving to everyone & he's gone and thats the end of it The President spent approximately an hour in the ROVER briefing and meeting the staff at the laboratory here President Kennedy and Dr Bradbury leave the classified area to pose for the photographers. It was at the AEC's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory high in the mountains of New Mexico that the first steps were taken, here in the mid 50's scientists set about to determine if nuclear energy really could be used to provide rocket propulsion. I talked Norris into setting it up as a division so they agreed to form a division and I bummed people from W Division and anyplace else that seemed to be interested in this by that fall I think we had about fifty people at work, and then we had to go find a place to live, I stayed down at Parjito for quite awhile and I even had my headquarters there and we had people scattered all over the place, and then we finally laid hands on TA46 which is out on the Pajarito Road and that was our headquarters well throughout the duration of the so called ROVER program. They would test the reactor concepts at Los Alamos they would do a lot of development of the test reactors using a number of critical assembly stations that they assembled at the Parijito site and Raemer Schreiber lead this effort at Los Alamos to develop these reactors for use in Project KIWI. We had to start from scratch essentially saying how would we test all these reactors, the normal way of doing reactor testing is to put 'em inside a great big concrete vault so if something goes wrong why we had some protection, but when you're spewing out enormous quantities of Hydrogen or other hot gases why that isn't a very practical system and so the decision was made that we turn things around the controls and the instrumentation would be inside the concrete block house and the people would be well removed from there at a separate control area, and we also selected the Jackass Flats area for this test site for this testing. If you turn one of these reactors on your going from liquid hydrogen temperatures to thousands of degrees very quickly and so they were faced with these enormous materials challenges, KIWI was really designed to solve some of those problems and there are number of reactors in the KIWI series that progressed from essentially zero power, which is what they would be able to test at the Parjito site in Los Alamos, all the way up to powered versions that that ran at, you know hundreds of kilowatts, hundreds of megawatts. The technology that Dr Schreiber promoted was a technology known as a nuclear thermal rocket and basically what this is is using a reactor is a big heat source, and then you take a gas like hydrogen, you compress it and force it through this nuclear reactor and the nuclear reactor transfers heat it expands and it exits the nozzle of the rocket at Incredibly high-velocity. It was a very interesting program in that nobody had done anything of this general nature before, we had to be extremely careful to test everything we could without actually firing up the reactor, when they decided they wanted something like this, we were under very heavy pressure to move as rapidly as possible, the Russians had put up Sputnik in the fall of '57 I believe, and the United States wasn't doing too well in regard to similar exploits and the Atlas Missile which had been under development for quite a few years, chemical rocket, was having its problems, so in between doing things here at the laboratory, I was always rushing back to a congressional hearing to assure Senator Anderson and the other eager supporters of the ROVER program that we were working just as hard as we could and no we didn't need anymore money, all we needed was to solve a few technical problems. With KIWI he spent so much time in Washington D.C., I think he probably was home half of every month and traveling the rest of the time, that was a part of that project he did not like and that was all the politicking that had to be done during that period of time, and I was in high school for lot of that, he just wasn't there, when he was he was distracted and we we're all being just a little careful around him because he was very tired, he didn't travel well. Meantime we had designed a KIWI B, which was looking much more like a rocket engine and had a sizeable nozzle on it and I'd been getting help from Aerojet and Rocketdyne on pumps and nozzle design and fabrication, and KIWI B then was run with liquid hydrogen being pumped in and vaporized as it went into the reactor, and a couple things didn't go too smoothly for awhile because we tried to run two or three reactors & we would get going pretty well and then pieces would start flying out the nozzle, which isn't exactly the proper behavior for a nuclear rocket, supposed to run for 20 to 25 minutes, to make a long story short it was finally found out that we had not properly considered all of the aerodynamic forces that we're operating on the fuel element bundles In blowing this enormous stream of Hydrogen through there, and so it took a number of tests and rather strenuous redesign work under extreme pressure out of Washington to get a reactor which would indeed hold itself together and run for any extended period of time. We'll we finally solved these problems and we ran several reactors for periods of up 15-20 minutes, the mission was originally thought to require a 10 minute burn by reactor but in the meantime the targets we're set higher and higher and we would get a reactor ready for testing and for someone decided that wasn't really quite good enough and so we had to start redesigning and replanning for even higher performance, longer times, ability to restart in space and all those sorts of things, The Phoebus phase was actually the attempt to build power plant scale reactors that could actually be used in nuclear rockets, and Phoebus really consisted of three large scale reactors that were tested out at the Nevada test site and they incorporated some enormous power densities, if you think of a 2 liter bottle, if you think of that volume being used to generate 10 million watts that was the power density that was found in the highest power test with the Phoebus reactors, even by todays standards have really not been and not been matched. By '69 NASA who had taken over and become a great empire in itself, finally decided that they we're not go for a manned man in space beyond the moon landing, so the ROVER program was phased out, we'll we did have one triumph before that, technical triumph at least, in that we ran the Phoebus 2 reactor at 4000 megawatts, which I think was the world record at that time, which may still stand for a total power out of a single reactor which translates into about a 200,000 pound thrust, which is nothing to be sneered at. That was the apex of of work on Project Rover that was the highest powers, the highest power densities, the longest duration tests, the largest reactors, and it demonstrated a high level of technological readiness to move these systems into practical nuclear rocketry. In the summer '61 Daryl Froman decided that he was going to retire and so there was a search put on for an associate technical director to replace him, I was selected to be that person and moved up to the 4th floor in January of '62. The reason I have talked about the ROVER program so extensively is that I continued to have the major responsibility for that as far as the division of work between Norris and myself was concerned, my job there was to keep on top of the number of different programs and take care of some of the administrative chores, it's very complicated story if you start writing a job description to 5 or 6 pages I suspect. Work at the laboratory continued we had the ROVER program phased out but by the time that was phasing out there were other programs coming in. And then in 1970, Norris decided he was going to retire and there was a search for a director, my hat was in the ring for at least a brief period of time, the more I thought about it the less I felt at that age I wanted to undertake the job and furthermore, I felt that the demands particularly in field of public relations in Washington and in spearheading the weapons program was something that I just didn't want to get involved in, of course Harold Agnew came out as a selection no surprise to anyone I think and I was given the job of keeping University of California happy and I took over more and more of the administrative duties and so from that time up and including my time before my retirement, I had the responsibility for the 11 departments I think it was, in addition to serving as the number two man to the director, once the decisions we're made, it was my job to see to that they were carried out, meaning while that is fine once you start slowing down, it's very difficult to recognize you got to run fast and can't keep up with the younger people. My retirement was in December of '74 and it was about that time also that I got contacted by Jack Campbell, former Governor Campbell, I guess is the more polite way of putting it, to see if I would be interested in going on to the energy resources board. After my grandfather retired he still very much involved with the lab, very much involved with the town, he was President American Nuclear Society he was very much involved with a lot of the nonproliferation. My dad passed away in '98 when he was 88 we called Roger Meade to do the details of the memorial service which was held 3 days later at Fuller Lodge, to put together such a marvelous celebration of my dads life, Roger was just invaluable. Approximately 6000 people jammed the football field to welcome the President. And lastly I think this country has performed its great function because as Senator Anderson has said, it's people have had brains and we have appreciated the cult of excellence and we have developed that talent in a way which is served our country and served mankind and there are no group of people in this country, whose record over the last 20 years has been more preeminent in the service of their country than all of you here in this small community in New Mexico. We want to express our thanks to you, its not merely what was done during the days of the second war, but what is been done since then, not only in developing weapons of destruction which by and irony of fate help maintain the peace and freedom, but also in medicine, and in space and all the other related fields which can mean so much to mankind if we can maintain the peace and protect our freedom. I think Dr Schreiber's legacy is a very important one, whether it was his work with the Manhattan Project or his work with nuclear rockets I mean this is a person who had this hand in shaping the course of human history. The reason that nuclear thermal rockets are particularly important at this moment in history is that NASA is finally, seriously considering a manned Mars mission, any type of Mars mission involves a long trip being constantly bathed in Cosmic Rays and nuclear thermal rockets provide a way of to get from point A to point B, in space far faster for far less fuel and we now know that with modern material science we can make these far better than there creators ever imagined. I think we can have that conversation now I think culturally were able to appreciate the benefits and the risks of nuclear technology, I think we can competently get back in the saddle on a project like this, we already have done a lot of the work necessary, this program was wildly successful according to nuclear propulsion folks at NASA, it was it was essentially ready to go and you can say, well we can leave those Curies in the desert and it can all be in vain, or we can take that knowledge and essentially use it and work with it again. We have climbed the tallest peaks on earth, we have explored basically on the land most places on the surface of our planet, but there is an infinite universe out there and hopefully using nuclear technology including the kind of reactor technology that Dr Schreiber was a driving force at Los Alamos, that technology, I have very little doubt, will propel us to the planets ...and beyond.
