WELL, ONE'S FOR THE STORY AND ONE, IT'S FOR YOU, PAL. YOU ACT LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD, MAN. TOTALLY FUCKIN' CHILDISH. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY. -SORRY. -TURN THOSE CAMERAS OFF ME, BOY. I SAID, TURN 'EM OFF. YOU'RE FIXIN' TO GET HURT. IT'S A BAD IDEA TO MAKE THREATS WHILE YOU'RE BEING RECORDED, MR. BAGBY. WELL, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE. I AM REGINALD BLOCK-HUNSLEIGH WITH INSTANT KARMA INVESTIGATIVE NEWS SERVICE. DESCRIBE TO ME YOUR INTERACTION WITH MR. BAGBY. WELL, BASICALLY, MR. BAGBY TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW OF A HOUSE THAT HAD FORECLOSED AND THAT I COULD GET IT FOR HALF THE MARKET VALUE. [THE REG] BUT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? [MAN] THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. IF IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, THEN IT PROBABLY IS. I SOLD THIS HOME SIX MONTHS AGO. TALK TO THE OWNER. HE'LL TELL YOU. -THERE'S NO FRAUD THERE. -OH, "ARMEN BAGBABIAN"? HE DOESN'T EXIST. BUT SOMEHOW, HE SOLD THE SAME HOUSE TO FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. WHAT IS THIS PAPERWORK WITH THEIR NAMES ON IT DOING IN YOUR TRASH CAN? -IN MY TRASH? -THAT'S RIGHT. WELL YOU MUST HAVE PUT IT THERE. I SHRED EVERYTHING. WHAT DO THINK, I'M FUCKIN' STUPID? GET OFF MY PROPERTY. THOSE PAPERS ARE MINE, MR. BAGBY. IF THEY'RE IN MY TRASH, THEN THEY'RE MINE. "INSTANT KARMA"... TRYING TO CRUCIFY OLD EVANDER, EH? PUNK-ASS HONKY MOTHERFUCKERS. "HONKY"? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? [ZORN] YEP, YEP, LOOK, LOOK. HE'S CALLING SOMEONE. [BAGBY] YEAH, PAUL GLADSTONE. PAUL, IT'S EVANDER BAGBY. HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNIN' YOUR MOUTH? WELL, SOME TV NEWS GUYS WERE POKIN' AROUND ABOUT ARMEN BAGBABIAN. -LOOK. -"PAUL GLADSTONE." [LAUGHS] PAUL GLADSTONE? REGINALD BLOCK-HUNSLEIGH, INSTANT KARMA INVESTIGATIVE NEWS SERVICE. YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE NAMES? I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE? EVANDER BAGBY CLAIMS THAT YOU DO. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE HE SAID? THE TRUTH IS IF A REAL ESTATE BROKER WANTS TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM, THEY CAN. THESE CONFORMING LOANS, I RARELY SEE THE APPLICANT. I RELY ON THE HONESTLY AND INTEGRITY OF THE BROKERS THAT I DEAL WITH. AND 99% OF THE TIME, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. AND I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE ON THE OTHER 1%. -[POLICE RADIO CHATTER] -[RAPS] BAGBY, RIGHT THERE! STOP! MR. BAGBY. [THE REG] REAL ESTATE FRAUD IS NOT NEW. BUT A NEW BREED OF CRIMINAL IS USING EVER MORE INGENIOUS METHODS TO FOOL UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE INTO SIGNING THEIR DREAMS AND CREDIT AWAY. WE UNCOVERED DOCUMENTS FROM A TRASH CAN AT BAGBY REALTY THAT HINT AT THE SCAM. THE OWNER OF BAGBY REALTY, EVANDER BAGBY, -WAS NONE TOO HAPPY TO SEE US. -I SAID, TURN 'EM OFF. [THE REG] AND NEITHER WAS HE TOO ASHAMED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR HIS HANDIWORK. IF IT'S IN MY TRASH, THEN THEY'RE MINE. [THE REG] IT WAS A LUCRATIVE SCAM WHILE IT LASTED, WITH MOST OF THE BOGUS LOANS ORIGINATED BY GOLD COAST FINANCIAL. FORTUNATELY, MR. BAGBY KEPT METICULOUS RECORDS. WE SUSPECT HE COULD HAVE HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS. [THE REG] SO HOW DOES IT FEEL HAVING YOUR CREDIT DESTROYED AND DREAMS SHATTERED, MR. WASHINGTON? PERSONALLY, I'D LIKE TO KILL THAT MOTHER[BLEEP]. [THE REG] IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN AND THINK YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HIS VICTIM, CALL DETECTIVE ALBRIGHT AT THE LAPD FRAUD SQUAD-- 213-611-0022. TERRIFIC. I'LL TAKE IT! I GOTTA TELL YOU, I GOT A NEWSROOM OF SALARIED REPORTERS AND NONE OF THEM COME UP WITH THE KINDS OF STORIES YOU DO. HEY, INSTANT KARMA-- BRINGIN' SCUMBAGS OF THE WORLD TO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION FOR OVER... [BOTH] FIVE YEARS. WHY DON'T YOU COME WORK FOR ME? AH, WELL, WE LIKE BEING OUR OWN BOSSES. IF WE TOOK A JOB WITH YOU, WE COULDN'T GET HIGH AT WORK. I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF A DEAL BREAKER FOR US. [CHUCKLES] BY THE WAY, I SPOKE WITH LEGAL ABOUT THE STRAIGHT GUYS WHO AREN'T. -OH, RIGHT. -YOU KNOW, THAT PIECE I BOUGHT FROM YOU? CAN A MAN BE STRAIGHT AND HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX WITH OTHER MEN? SOME MEN APPARENTLY THINK THE ANSWER IS... YES. WE FINALLY GOT SERVED LAST WEEK. I MEAN, WHAT A JOKE. I MEAN, THESE DAYS YOU CAN SUE SOMEONE FOR TRIPPIN' OVER YOUR OWN SHOELACE. [BLAKE] WELL, THE THING IS, THIS MAGNUS MARTINDALE-- HE'S NOT DENYING CRUISING A HOOK-UP OFF "GREGSLIST." -MM-HMM. -HE'S JUST CLAIMING IT WAS A BAIT-AND-SWITCH-- THAT HE WAS EXPECTING TO MEET A WOMAN AT THIS MOTEL, NOT A GUY, AND THAT YOU GUYS CUT YOUR PIECE TO GIVE IT THE OPPOSITE IMPRESSION TO MAKE HIM SEEM LIKE HE WAS SECRETLY GAY. APPARENTLY HIS WIFE'S LEAVIN' HIM OVER IT. SO HE ADMITS TO CHEATING ON HIS WIFE, JUST NOT WITH A DUDE? HE'S A FUCKIN' ASSHOLE. -HE'S A FUCKIN' ASSHOLE. -FUCKIN' ASSHOLE. [BLAKE] WELL, IT MAKES IT EASY TO RESOLVE, THOUGH. JUST RUN OFF A COPY OF YOUR RAW FOOTAGE, ZORN. MY RAW FOOTAGE? WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE-MAN BAND ON THAT ONE, RIGHT?

THIS WAS HIS IDEA. -[ZORN] FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE. -NO, FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE! -FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE! -FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE! YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU GO FUCK YOUR ASS WITH YOUR DICK, YOU FUCKHOLE? OH, WHY DON'T YOU GO FUCK YOUR OWN ASS, FUCKIN' ASSHOLE? [SLAMS] -[VAN DOOR CLOSES] -"MY ONE-MAN BAND"! "MY ONE-MAN BAND"! OH, COME ON. DON'T ACT SURPRISED, MAN. YOU KNEW I TOLD HIM BECAUSE I ALREADY ADMITTED IT TO YOU. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE FUCKING CAMERAS, RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW, YOU TOLD ME. BUT FUCKING HEARING IT COME OUT OF HIS OWN MOUTH, IT JUST MADE IT REAL IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. LOOK, BLAKE CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT. WE HADN'T EVEN BEEN SERVED YET. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, PFF-- TO COVER YOUR OWN ASS, RIGHT? LAY THE WHOLE THING OFF ON ME? YOU KNOW ALL I DID WAS EDIT THE PIECE, MAN. LISTEN, I WAS JUST TRYING TO BUY SOME TIME UNTIL WE FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO, OKAY? [WHISPERS] I'M SORRY. "STRAIGHT GUYS WHO AREN'T"? YOU KNOW, LIKE I GIVE A SHIT. I ALWAYS SAID, MAN, "NO SEX, NO CELEBRITIES." IT'S CHEAP. AND IT CHEAPENS US. AND MAUREEN THINKS IT'S AN "IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WOMEN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT." YOU KNOW, I WONDER IF MAUREEN KNOWS THAT YOU'RE CHECKING OUT GREGSLIST "CASUAL ENCOUNTERS." "CASUAL ENCOUNTERS" IS ABOUT CONNECTING COCKS AND PUSSIES, OR PUSSIES AND PUSSIES. OR COCKS AND COCKS. OR COCKS AND ASSHOLES. YOU KNOW, THE OPERATIVE PHRASE HERE IS "CAVEAT EMPTOR"-- "BUYER BEWARE." ASSUME ANYONE CHASING A QUICK HOOK-UP ON GREGSLIST IS NOT ALL THEY CLAIM TO BE. SHE DOESN'T. AND DON'T YOU FUCKIN' TELL HER. OH, HEY, DON'T WORRY, PAL. I DON'T ROLL ON MY HOMIES. IT'S COOL. IT'S COOL, MAN. I'M JUST-- YOU KNOW, HEY, AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT THESE DVS, -IT'S COOL, RIGHT? -NO, MAN, THIS IS NOT COOL.

THAT SHE WANTS TO USE THE FOOTAGE FROM THE STING IN HER DIVORCE. THAT'S NOT AN OFFER, THAT'S A REQUEST. DID YOU TELL HER YOU ERASED THE TAPES? [BELCHES] NO, I TOLD HER TO GET IN LINE. ZORN, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? DID YOU SEE HER, MAN? A WOMAN IN NEED IS A WOMAN, INDEED. ZORN, MAN, NEVER FORGET-- THE VAGINA IS A CUL-DE-SAC. BUT MAYBE IF MR.

UH, ACTUALLY, THOSE WOULDN'T BE ANY HELP TO HER. BUT, YOU DO HAVE THOSE TAPES, DON'T YOU? WE'RE A LOW-BUDGET OPERATION, OKAY? WE'RE CONSTANTLY RECYCLING TAPES. WE SHOT THAT PIECE LIKE TWO MONTHS AGO.

YET ALL THIS TIME, MAN, I WAS NEVER JEALOUS THAT YOU HAD HER. I WAS HAPPY FOR YOU. I MEAN, ANYWAY, I MEAN, SHE WAS HOPE FOR ME. PROOF THAT A WOMAN COULD ACTUALLY BE ALL THAT MAUREEN IS. BUT THE WAY YOU CHEAT ON HER, MAN, IT HURTS HER. YOU KNOW, SHE JUST KEEPS IT TO HERSELF THINKING, YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY YOU'LL CHANGE, AND YOU'LL SEE HER FOR WHAT SHE'S WORTH. UH, I GUESS MAYBE SHE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU THESE THINGS SO THAT'S WHY SHE TELLS ME, BUT I COULDN'T, MAN. I'M NOBODY'S MOTHER. PEOPLE JUST GOTTA WORK SHIT OUT. OR NOT. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, MAN.

THAT'S THE TRUTH BEHIND "CASUAL ENCOUNTERS." YOU GET YOUR FUCK ON EASY WITHOUT ANY MESSY EMOTIONAL CONNECTION. IN A WAY, IT'S THE PUREST FORM OF CAPITALISM-- YOU KNOW, PUTTING SELLERS IN FRONT OF BUYERS. WHAT YOU DO AFTER THAT IS UP TO YOU. WE DON'T GUARANTEE THE MERCHANDISE. WE'RE JUST THE FACILITATORS.
