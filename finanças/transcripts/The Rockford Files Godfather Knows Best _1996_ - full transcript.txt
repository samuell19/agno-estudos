(WAVES BREAKING) OFFICER 1: You two, cover the front. Barnes and Williams, you got the rear. OFFICER 2: Right. (DOG BARKING) (SIGHS) What? What... (BANGING ON DOOR) OFFICER 1: Open your door! Police Department! (SIGHS) If there's no answer, knock it down. Open the door! Police! Open your door! (BANGING ON DOOR) Police Department! Kick it! Come on. What the... OFFICER 1: Freeze! (OFFICERS SHOUTING) Hands up over your head! Now! ROCKFORD: Oh, what... What... Against the wall. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Spread 'em. You have the right to remain silent. Put your hands together here, now. Spread 'em a little further. Anything you say or do will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you... Hold your hands still, now. (SIRENS WAILING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Ah, you guys never learn, do you? How many multi-million dollar settlements do you think this town's gonna go for? What's that supposed to mean? Well, you ought to be able to figure that one out. I'm suing your butts off, collectively and individually. On what grounds? Well, how about false arrest? These stormtroopers had to be your idea, Chapman. Oh, Diehl, has this guy gone completely over the edge? I mean, when did I qualify for the Ten Most Wanted? My office. (SIGHS) False arrest, huh? You know something? You're full of it. You never commit any crimes, but you always wind up at the booking desk. What is that, coincidence or what? More like sloppy police work. You know something? You're 90% mouth, aren't you? Look, let's just do this and get the hell out of here. When I get rousted out of bed in the middle of the night, it tends to put me in a really lousy mood. (LAUGHS) Well, you can imagine the mood I am in. I not only got rousted, I got patted down. Try that at 3:00 in morning. You know the drill, Rockford. You've been busted often enough. You could have been carrying a concealed weapon. Yeah? Where? Any other complaints? Well, how about malicious destruction of property? Hmm? I really ought to... You know, I don't expect the department to turn out charm school graduates, but the primates Chapman sent out there, they not only busted the door locks, they busted the doors. You can teach 'em the entire California Penal Code, you can't teach 'em a little patience? Is that it? Not even close. You'll get all the particulars when my attorney files all the appropriate papers. McENROE: Attorney? CHAPMAN: You can't threaten us, Rockford. DIEHL: Sure, he can. What's he got to lose? Did I mention that I have a breakfast meeting with the Chief? Is it my turn now? Well, these cuffs are put on, so I don't have any feeling in my left hand. I think it was deliberate. (EXCLAIMS) Who would want to hurt you? Take 'em off. Sir. Sir, we ought to keep the cuffs on him till we put him in a cell. What's he gonna do, make a break for it? If he does, Officer, you shoot him. (STUTTERING) That breakfast with the Chief, there was some talk about a lawsuit, I mean, a slide presentation. I really ought to look into it. Is it okay if I get a cup of coffee? (SNICKERS) It'll just give you something else to complain about. Sure, go ahead, help yourself. (PHONE RINGING) Commander Diehl. Yes. Uh-huh, I see. ... Well... (MOUTHING) He's right behind... Yeah, write it up. I gotcha. Chapman, that was forensics, and... Hey, you. What do you think you're doing? Sir? What the hell are you wearing? You working under cover? Oh, no, I'm not on duty, sir. I just came by the station because, uh, well, I heard. DIEHL: You heard we ran in your friend, Rockford, right? He is a friend of yours, isn't he? BECKER: Well, that's a loosely used word, sir. I mean, we run into people all the time. That doesn't mean that they're your friends. You are in his "Known associates" file. Oh. Maybe we can use you in there. He might relax with you, maybe open up faster. You comfortable with that? Fine. Sir, what is he doing here? They're friends, you know. What the hell did you do this time? You got Chapman and Diehl on your case. Well, I didn't do anything. Not that it seems to matter. What the hell are you doing here? What kind of a dumb question is that? I work here. Well, not at this time of the morning, and not dressed like that, you don't. The sergeant at the booking desk knows we're friends. Everybody in this department knows we're friends. Chapman, Diehl... I'm a "Known associate‚Äù. Officially, I'm in the computer. Once in, it stays in. There's no getting it out! I can feel my career hitting that "Do not resuscitate" wall. Is there an answer to my dumb question in all that? The sergeant at the desk called me at home. He woke me up. Oh, what a shame. I slept in till 3:00. Okay, Rockford, we're all tired. Maybe we can try and wrap this up. Wrap what up? Nobody's told me what you dragged me down here for. Well, maybe somebody would if you'd shut up for five minutes. You been Mirandized? I know what my rights are. Nothing is easy with you, is it? I've been Mirandized. Fine. So, we'll start with something simple. The bad blood between you and Bud Monckton, when did that start? Is that who's behind this? I should have guessed. It has his paw prints all over it. There's no bad blood. CHAPMAN: You attacked him at the Goodhew Awards a couple of months ago. He attacked me. That's not what I heard. Well, you heard it wrong, Chapman. You always do. I would say it's your big failing, but you have so many. What about the altercation that took place last Thursday? That Monckton's fault, too? Yes. Every time I run into the guy, he's all over me. He keeps accusing me of trying to steal his clients. That's what happened last Thursday. I show up on what he considers his turf, and he went ballistic. Were you trying to steal his client? Forget he said that. He's sorry. I'm what? Sorry. Right, we covered that. So, you showed up at Monckton's workplace because... Well, about 10 days ago, I took a job that had nothing to do with Bud Monckton. Yeah, I hate paperwork. But every once in a while, well, I was playing Catch Up. ROCKFORD: Oh, Bobby. (LAUGHING) Bobby. Hey. Hey, no, I'm not ducking you. No. Hey, hey, yeah. Bobby, yeah, I know what I said. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, look, Bobby, I can't give you what I don't have. I'm tapped out. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Well, yes, I know it's been three and a half weeks. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Listen, if it makes you feel any better, I got at least a half a dozen other people who've been waiting for payment for over two months. Yeah. Bobby? Bobby? Oh, damn it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey... Your door is locked. I thought it was just stuck, but I couldn't budge it, and I'm a lot stronger than I look. I do weight training. Not to bulk up. Hector would hate that. Actually, I'd hate that, too. I don't think it's attractive on a woman, all those muscles. Oh, I'm talking too much, aren't 1? (STAMMERING) It's because I'm so nervous. I've never done this sort of thing before. You probably don't think so because you do it all the time, but from my side, it's very scary. Oh, it's a good idea having a kitchen. That way, you don't have to go out to lunch, maybe miss a client. You could offer someone a cup of coffee. Oh, would you care... Oh, not for me, thank you. I try to limit my caffeine. Probably a good idea. But... But I keep it at home. I offer it to my friends. I'm no fanatic. You know, this is... This is really nice. It's very warm, very comfortable. It's not like an office at all. It feels more like somebody's home. It is somebody's home. Mine. Oh, my God. You're not James Rockford? Oh, I wrote down the wrong address. I'm really sorry. I don't know what to say, I... Wait. No, no, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. It's the right address. I'm Jim Rockford, and this is my office and my home. Oh. Now, why don't you come right over here? (CHUCKLES) You sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Tell me what I can do for you. Randy said you were easy to talk to. He said he felt like he'd known you for years. Randy? Randolph Silvero. Silvero Micro-CompuMeg. He's a family friend. He told us what you did for him. He said you were very discreet. That's the most important thing for me, discretion. Of course, with me, it's not like it was with Randy. It's not industrial espionage. But you take other cases, don't you? Not unless I know the client's name. Oh, I... I'm... I'm really sorry. (STUTTERING) I'm not always like this. It's just that lately, I've been... I'm Linda. Linda Gustavo. How do you do? Mrs. Hector Gustavo. Randy told us what you charge, so we don't have to talk about that. I'll pay you for a week in advance, not including expenses, since we don't know what they are. If it takes more than a week, I'll be happy to pay you more. Is that all right? Oh, sounds fine. (STUTTERING) I just have to know what you want me to do. (LAUGHING) You know, is it some sort of investigation? Investigation. Yes. Yes. (STUTTERING) This is very difficult. (SIGHING) (STAMMERING) I... I'm just going to say it. I'm going to put it out there and I'm going to deal with it. I am not going to cry. Thank you. I think my husband is sleeping with another woman. No, I don't think, I know he's sleeping with her. Mrs. Gustavo... He comes home, he smells from her perfume, his clothes, his hair. (SOBBING) Do you know how long it's been since we made love? Before, he couldn't take his hands off me. I even know who it is. All I need is proof. Mrs. Gustavo... (SIGHS) ...you don't know how difficult this is for me, but, much as I'd like to help you, I don't handle domestic cases. It isn't a question of money. I know. You think if you give me proof, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna kill my husband. I 'am not... Well, no, I... ...going to kill my husband, Mr. Rockford. I am not even going to kill that tramp from the office. He's going to fire her and never see her again. I have been married for 12 years. Do you think I am going to let Eleanor Hooperman just walk off with Hector? Mrs. Gustavo, when I went into this business years ago, I made just one promise to myself. No domestic cases. Now, I've never broken that promise, and I don't intend to now. No matter how much I'd like to help you... No, no. Don't do that. Now, don't do that. That's way too much. There are some very good people out there. They're easy to talk to, discreet. I'd be happy to refer someone. Why don't I just kill myself? I'd rather be dead than run all over town, telling total strangers about my sex life. I'm a total stranger. No, you're not. You know Randy. Now, you said you weren't going to cry. (CRYING) I can't help it. You took Randy's money. Why won't you take mine? You don't know how difficult you're making this for me. (STUTTERING) I mean, as much as I'd like to help you, this just isn't my kind of case. Not at all. (PHONE RINGING) That's not your kind of case? Sure, it is. What'd you do for the lady, Rockford? Break into some cheesy hotel room with a photographer, catching Gustavo in flagrante delicto? Yeah, me and Lyle Talbot, we work as a team. Does he have to be here? Yes. Can we get some decent coffee in here? Good idea. So, you got hired by Linda Gustavo to get the goods on her old man. And you did this by following him? Well, I followed him, yeah. I also got a job at his record company, Felicidad Records. Which is where you had the confrontation with Bud Monckton. No, which is where he had his confrontation with me. The guy's paranoid. I... He runs security for them. He thought I was trying to steal the account. I was just trying to check up on Gustavo from the inside. So, I wrote a few glossy letters of recommendation. I got exactly the job I was shooting for. It gave me unquestioned access to the whole complex, and at the same time it rendered me invisible. RECEPTIONIST: Felicidad Records. I'm sorry, she's not in... So, did you finish the copy? He's going to be asking for it, you know. It's on his desk. He'll probably want me to rewrite it before lunch. Again. ELEANOR: He's a perfectionist. STRINGER: He's a control freak. Yeah. That, too. I'm going to say no. Hey, I'm the writer. I'm not going to let him ruin my work. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Come in, come in. Sit down. I've been going over your copy, Sam. It's just not there. You know, there's no juice in it. No excitement. What you hear in the music, that's what I want in the words. I don't know how you can listen to this and give me that. I'll have a rewrite for you when you get back from lunch. (LAUGHING) Did I ask for a rewrite? Hmm? I think that's your problem right there. You rewrote the life out of it. Put it away. Go back to it in a couple of days. See what happens. Look, I know it seems like I've been beating up on you a lot lately. Hell, I've been beating up on everyone. It's because we've finally got a shot with this one. It's gonna take off, I know it. You're that sure? Have I ever said anything like that before, in all these years? I think the whole Latin thing is going to explode. Go mainstream, like it did in the '40s. Carmen Miranda, a major star. Cugat, he was making movies, playing clubs, selling records, selling chihuahuas. In the '40s, if it was Latin, it was happening. My God, listen to this. (VOLUME INCREASES) You got a bunch of monks all over the charts! You think that's not going to go platinum? (MUSIC STOPS) (REMOTE CLATTERS) Come on, let's eat. Can we go someplace besides Rex's? (LAUGHING) People fight to get into that place, and you got a problem with it. You know, executives all over the world take courses on how to avoid trouble. They vary their work schedules, vary the routes they travel. So? I do that. You also have lunch at the same time, at the same restaurant, and at the same table every single day. If anyone, anyone, wanted to get you, they wouldn't have to set up some elaborate ambush. They could just wait for you at Rex's. Nobody wants to get me. Unless it's someone who bought one of our earlier releases. (SIGHS) My God, 20 years of nose flutes and clam shells, and Amazonian goatherd choirs. Get the baseboards, okay? Last guy did a lousy job. And be out of here by the time we get back. (DOOR CLOSING) Rockford. What the hell are you doing here? (EXHALES) A remedial reading course would open up whole new worlds for you, Bud. Oh, sure, you're building maintenance, right? What am I, stupid? I never swing at the easy ones. You can tell me, or you can tell the cops. I'm gonna call 'em. Well, good idea. I'll tell 'em what I'm doing here, you tell 'em what you're doing. What I'm doing is security. Oh, you're going to have a hard time making that one fly. Security doesn't hang bugs on the boss. Why'd you say that? Did you find something? I don't have to find a bug to know that you've hung 'em all over the place. It's your M.O., Bud. Anybody that knows you knows that. You know, being stupid and predictable isn't all it's cracked up to be. (BOTH GRUNTING) (ROCKFORD SHOUTING) How about we go back to that bad blood that didn't exist between the two of you? You never liked Monckton, did you, Rockford? What's to like? He's a tree with lips. He's also dead. You entered his house at 9:45 p.m. A disturbance was heard at 10:30 p.m. The coroner confirms that as the probable time of death. The security camera never clocked you out. Look, Monckton called me and asked me to meet him at his place. He said he had some information. He wanted to make a deal with me. When I got there, the place was empty, so I left. You expect us to believe that? Of course not. It's the truth. I want my attorney. Sure, fine. Becker can make the call for you, if you like. Would you do that, Dennis? Would you tell her to get over here, right away? Who? Kit? My ex-wife? What the hell's the matter with you? Why would I want to drag her into this? Beth. Call Beth. Beth? Yeah. Call her. Here, use mine. You mind telling me the cause of death? Like he doesn't know. He was shot. BECKER: This is Lieutenant Becker. I'd like to have the phone number for Elizabeth, or Beth Van Sant. Maiden name, Davenport. Oh, the listing might be under her husband's name. Uh... Roger. Roger Van Sant. Yeah, you can try Beverly Hills, Brent wood, Bel Air, Holmby... Pasadena. Pasadena, even. Yeah, I'll hold. What caliber weapon do you own, Rockford? .38. Where is this weapon kept? (SIGHS) Lieutenant? In the cookie jar. (SCOFFS) What? In the cookie jar, sir. (LAUGHS) We got motive. We got opportunity. And once we pick up the murder weapon, we got you. Right to the wall with me, huh, Dennis? Don't start. Beth's waiting in the squad room. Thanks. No, thanks a lot, since my right to consult with an attorney is recognized under the law, but thanks. Knock it off, okay? There's nothing for me to feel guilty about, so don't even try. You told them I carry a .38. Like that information's not in the computer? My cookie jar isn't in the computer. At least, it wasn't. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (PHONE RINGING) Hi. We can go to my office, but I thought you could use some coffee first. Thanks, Dennis. Do you believe that moron, Chapman's trying to hang a murder rap on me? Punching people out all the time? What the hell you expect? Oh, when did I become the town bully? Monckton's the guy that has a problem in that area, not me. Had a problem. What'd you do to your hair? Nothing. I just let it go natural. Well, you don't have curly hair, you have straight hair. You've always had straight hair. I used to have it straightened, Jim. I don't any more. I liked it straight. I didn't. You used to wear suits. Oh, you don't like what I have on? I didn't say that. No, no, what you have on is fine. (CHUCKLING) Well, it's a little casual, considering the circumstances, but... You wake me up in the middle of the night... ROCKFORD: Oh, come on, it's hardly the middle of the night, Beth. It is for those of us who didn't get to bed until 2:30. We ought to take this into the office. After four years of not hearing one word from you, I get a call from Dennis saying big surprise, you're in trouble. For privacy. I drag myself down here, don't ask me why, old habits die hard, I guess. And what do I get? "Thanks? Nice to see you?" No, I get a critique on my hair style and a dress code alert. Guys, we're starting to draw a crowd. CHAPMAN: Becker... Beth... No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now, I know it's been a while, but it hasn't been any four years. Four years, practically to the day. How do I know that? Because I took you out to lunch. A very nice lunch to celebrate the publication of my first book. We had champagne, which neither of us like, particularly, but it seemed appropriate. I gave you an autographed copy of the book, and that, as they say, was that. (SIGHS) That was four years ago? When it actually made the New York Times Best-Seller List, I thought, "Oh, he's gotta call now." It was on the list for over a year. Nineteen months, for the sake of accuracy. My second book did even better. (STUTTERING) I don't... I don't know what to say. You've got a right to be sore. Hey, it's history. Well, Beth, where are you going? Home. I don't practice law any more. I haven't practiced it in years. Well, isn't it kind of like riding a bicycle? You can't leave me now. You're good. I need good. I need your knowledge, your expertise. And? Your ability to carry me for a couple of months. Four, tops. You know, I gotta put my trailer back together. That's gonna take what little I have. I want you to file a separate suit against this department for malicious destruction of property. Major damages. Flattered as I am, let me put this so you'll understand it, Jim. If I were practicing law, which I am not, it would be a polar day in hell before I'd ever represent you again. And I don't like your hair either. Where's she going? Well, it doesn't matter. We don't need her anyway, right now. Why don't we need her? Not that we have her. Your .38 wasn't there, so they decided not to charge you. At least, not yet. Too circumstantial without the weapon. What do you mean it wasn't there? They looked in the cookie jar. They found Oreos. Did they look under the Oreos? These are trained police officers. Of course, they looked under the Oreos. It wasn't there. Go home. You know, this would go a lot faster if you'd stop trying to help me. Well, tell me what to do. The temptation is strong. Look, I do this all the time. You leave me alone for a few minutes and I'll have it up. Look good as new. It is new. (GRUNTS) Well, the cops busted it. If you ask me, they ought to pay for it. These things are expensive. I noticed. What makes them special? Anybody ever tell 'em, "You bust it, you buy it?" Probably not. Want some coffee, George? Nah. JESS: May I have a cup? Jess Wilding. I don't know if you remember me or not. Nobody forgets the IRS, Miss Wilding. Come on in. Take inventory. Slap a lien on something. You've made a few changes. Not all of them were my idea. (SIGHS) Is that going to be it for the small talk? I'm not here on business. What else is there? There's personal. It's so amazing. You could charge for this view. I don't. Why are you so hostile? (LAUGHS) You're the IRS, you tell me. It can't be the first time you've had this reaction. Oh, you still can't be sore about that audit I gave you. I was more than fair with you. Fair? You disallowed deductions that are key to the operation of my business. What? Dinner and the Lakers with Dennis Becker? Lieutenant Becker. He's a cop. He's a friend. Can't wait to tell him that's now common knowledge on a federal level. You're not at all like your father, you know. After I did your audit, he took me to dinner. He said that I'd worked hard and I earned a good supper. Yeah, sounds like Rocky. I was in Switzerland when he... I--- I didn't hear about his death until I came back home. I bought him a cuckoo clock. You know, a little one. I really think he would've gotten a kick out of that. You two stayed in touch? I didn't know that. Rocky never mentioned it. I'd like to visit his grave, if you don't mind. Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. I'll write the directions out for you. No, I don't mean that. I'd like you to go there with me. I think Rocky would want that. God, I'm going to miss him. Are you all right? (SNIFFS) Yeah. Sorry. I swore I wouldn't do this. Well, you and Rocky must've spent quite a lot of time together. I'm surprised I never ran into you at the ranch. Well, you always used to call before you came up, so when I'd get a call from Rocky saying, "Can we make it next weekend?" I knew it was because you were there. I don't think he wanted to share you. Or you. I got a few of those phone calls, too. You're having trouble with that, aren't you? You're having trouble with the idea that Rocky could have a relationship with somebody, and you wouldn't know anything about it. Hey, it's none of my business. You know, Rocky didn't just exist in a vacuum. You know, he was more than just your father. Isn't it great you turned up to point that out? I might never have figured that out on my own. Rocky was not a secretive man. He was an open book. Well, looks like you missed a couple of chapters. Yeah, well keeping me out of the loop wouldn't have been his idea. "Keeping you out of the loop"? Oh, forget it. I don't even know why I'm trying to talk to you. You're certainly not anything like your father. Yeah. Well, neither are you. (BOTH LAUGHING) (SIGHS) Fresh start? I'd like that. There's a car following us. Been with us since the top of the hill. Well, he doesn't have much choice. There's only one road out. That's what I thought. But when I stopped, he stopped, too. So what are you going to do? Lose him. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (TIRES SQUEALING) He's driving like a crazy person! He came that close to hitting me! He's going south on Sepulveda. You better get the cops out here before he kills somebody! (TIRES SQUEALING) (CARS HONKING) (SCREAMS) Hang on. (CAR BRAKES SQUEALING) (LAUGHING) You're good. MAN: Hey, watch it! Damn! What the hell do you think you're doing? You trying to kill somebody? What, you think I don't know what you've been doing? You think I wasn't gonna find out? Don't do that. Mr. Gustavo, if you'll just... Who put you up to this? Get back in the car, Jess. What should I do? What should I do? I said don't shove me. Now, I want names, damn it! Don't shove me, damn it! (BOTH GRUNTING) (SIREN WAILING) Hit him, Jim! Just hit him! Get back in the car, Jess. Hit him! Get back in the car! LEWIS ON PA: You two, break it up. Step away from the vehicle. Okay, everybody settle down. You all right, sir? Why don't you ask me if I'm all right? You all right? Yeah. I'm gonna file assault charges against this man. You want to file charges? You're the reason for this whole mess. Officer, he was following us. His car's in front of yours. He's been following me for over a week. You ask him if that's not true. You ask him if he hasn't been questioned in the death of one of my employees, if he isn't the number one suspect. It's a long story. Maybe I struck first. You bet you struck first. I'm a witness, Officer. Well, if I did, it was in self-defense. I was afraid he was carrying a gun. Check the car. Allow me. I mean, for all I know, I may be next on his list. The police officer I spoke with, a Captain Chapman, he said they've been trying to put him away for years. Look what I found. (SIGHS) MARTINEZ: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you... (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Lieutenant Becker. He's not in his office. Becker? No, ma'am. He's in Commander Diehl's office. (CHUCKLES) Been there a lot lately. I think he's in trouble. (LAUGHING) They seem quite busy today. Mmm. Are you here to confess? Excuse me? Well, I don't mean to pry, but, I have been here for 45 minutes, and you just came in. I'm an attorney. Oh, I don't need one. I did it. Oh. (CHUCKLES) (SNICKERS) (STAMMERING) I'm just... I'm just going... (MAN SHOUTING) Bye. Hi, Sally. SALLY: Good morning, Commander. I may have to get myself a larger office. Did you get everybody's statement? No, sir, I was waiting for you. Thank you. Oh, you've been spending so much time here, you're practically family. So, where do we start? Well, could we start with a couple of industrial strength aspirin? I have the worst headache. You're a real chronic complainer, aren't you, Rockford? You always gotta find something to bellyache about. Do you have an aspirin? I don't get headaches. Yeah? Well, you give 'em. Jess? Sorry. Dennis? Becker doesn't have any aspirin, Rockford. Nobody here has any aspirin. Could we please just get on with this? I can lay it out for you in very simple terms, Commander. He was following me. Right away, that's a lie! He followed us. I was following them because he was following me. You know, believe it or not, that actually makes sense. HECTOR: After what happened to Bud Monckton and Mr. Rockford's involvement in that... I had no involvement in that. I wanted to know why I was being followed. I demanded to know who hired him. Your wife hired him. What? Damn it, Chapman, that's inexcusable. But... That's privileged information. You can't just blat out something that was told to you in confidence. My wife? Yeah. Yeah, Linda. Uh, 52", 5'3", exotic looking. I'm not married. I've never been married. Your friend, Randy Silvero, recommended me. I don't know any Randy Silvero. Randy Silvero's not a figment of my imagination. He's the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Check it out. Mmm. You say you don't know who Linda Gustavo is? Well, neither do I. But she claims to be your wife. She even overpaid me to work for her. I've never done a domestic case before. Looks like you still haven't. I would like to know why I get stuck babysitting you. It's getting out of hand. They see you, they think me. It's like we're joined at the hip or something. They could've kept you in a holding cell. Are you listening to what's coming out of your mouth? Put me in a holding cell? Well, they could teach you something. At least, you'd realize that you could stay out of trouble for 24 hours. Dennis, I am trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare. Don't rap me across the knuckles. Get me some aspirin. What is this, a Christian Science Reading Room? I'd think twice about ticking off the one friend you have in the department. Your timing is not real good. Hi, Sally. Hi, Lieutenant. Oh! Hey, Becker. How's it going? Never better. Oh. That's not what I heard. (LAUGHING) What he heard? Oh, he doesn't know anything, Dennis. Don't bet on it. He's always sucking up to the brass. Hey, Pete, get Sally a cup of coffee and tell her I'll be a little while. Sure. Two sugars. She's a regular. Well, so am. You couldn't have had Pete pick up a couple of aspirin while he was at it? Would you knock it off? You're getting to sound like a real junkie. Do you know that bees can die of loneliness? Well, they can. Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting for you? What are you doing here? I thought I was your attorney. I thought you weren't. Well, I could hardly leave you unrepresented. Not with the regularity you're getting hauled in here. Don't touch those. Those are the revisions on my book. I feel like I need a program to keep up. It wouldn't help. So, what happened this time? Well, this time, it seems to be Gaslight, and I seem to be playing the Ingrid Bergman role. Do you have any aspirin? I don't think so. Were you in Diehl's office with Becker? With the gruff but lovable Chapman. (STAMMERS) You didn't make a statement? Of course, I made a statement. If I didn't make a statement, I wouldn't be out here. You didn't sign anything? I signed the statement. Without counsel present? I didn't know I had counsel. Are you sure you don't have any aspirin? I'm going to talk to Diehl. That really ticks me off. She made herself right at home. Did you see that? It may not be the corner office, but it's my office and my desk. What the hell do you think you're doing? I have a theory, Dennis. My theory is that you, Beth, everybody has aspirin, but for some inexplicable reason, nobody'll cop to it. Like it has some sort of stigma attached. Well, nobody ever collaborated with the Nazis, nobody ever spoke, and now nobody has aspirin. (EXCLAIMS) Now, what does that look like? |I don't know, and neither do you. Yeah, well I say it's aspirin. Any water? Hey, I'm not gonna let you take that... Now, now... Hey, give me that thing! Give me that! (BOTH GRUNTING) God! (MUMBLING) I don't believe you did something so damn stupid. (SIGHING) Shut up, Dennis. All I want to do is sit here and be real quiet till this stuff kicks in. What stuff? You don't even know what you took. All right, I talked to Diehl. He said that Hector Gustavo will not file assault charges if you will agree to psychiatric help. Go for it. What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, Beth. I guess I should've waited, but I really had to get something for this headache. I told you I didn't have any aspirin. Oh, you said you thought you didn't. I found some. I took two. You think that's enough to knock this headache? I don't know, but you won't have to worry about water retention. These are for PMS. (EXHALES) That's just great. Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? Hey, come back here! Hey! Chapman! Chapman, I've decided not to hang around for the rest of the inquisition. I know you're having a hell of a good time, but I'm not. I've got a killer headache, I'm tired, and I don't enjoy seeing even a lousy cop like you make this big an ass of himself. (BECKER SCOFFING) Jim, I really think... You've got bupkis for a case against me, and you know it. So, cut me loose now or book me. Okay. I'll book you. On circumstantial evidence? Finding my gun doesn't change anything. Your own men can testify it wasn't on my premises the night of the murder. They tore my whole place apart. And then, all of a sudden, somebody dials 911, I get rousted, and where's the missing weapon? In the trunk of a car that's already been searched. It's a setup. That's what you'd like us to believe, but we're not buying. I just got the lab report on your .38. It's the murder weapon. You're right about one thing. I am having a hell of a good time. (SIGHS) Bad is never good enough for you, is it? You have to make it worse. You have to alienate people. You forced him to lock you up. Oh, I didn't have to force him very hard. Dennis, uh, I need a favor. Yeah? So why are you coming at me? You're my friend. You're not going to stop until they cancel my pension, are you? Oh, Chapman knows you're my friend. You're even officially recognized by the IRS. IRS? Yeah. Would you see that Jess gets back to my place? She left her car there. Who's Jess? Oh, well, she's... She's a friend of Rocky's. Rocky? I thought that you and she were... I mean, she's a very attractive woman. Well, not all of dad's friends were hideous, Dennis. Some of them were quite attractive. Well, not many, of course. He was a modest man. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, it's very nice. I think it's terrific. A guy gets at a certain age and, uh, a lot of people think it's a 10-4 in his sex life. Who said anything about sex? I said she was his friend. Which is a euphemism, right? Wrong. What's the matter with you? There's nothing the matter with me, okay? Rocky was your father. Nobody likes to think of their parents as, you know. I mean, just take a look at the lady, Jimbo. All I'm trying to say is that no man, no matter how old, is gonna have a woman that looks like that just as a friend. I just have to sign my statement. They told me I can leave. Do you want me to wait for you? (CHUCKLES) Jim. Do you want me to wait? You better not. You could be looking at 20, 30 years. They're going to book you? They can't do that. He insisted. I'm looking for a Captain Chapman. I'm Chapman. What can I do for you? Do you have in your custody a James Rockford? I'm Rockford. Nobody's talking to you. He's Rockford. I was just gonna take him to book him. I'm afraid not. He's ours now. What the hell are you talking about? This man is my prisoner. No, he was your prisoner. Millard Weeks, FBI? Beth! He's now a prisoner of the federal government. Let's go. Beth. Beth. Okay, Mr. Rockford. Now, you know the drill. I have some questions that I'm going to ask. I have a few of those myself. I'm sure you do. Are we about ready here? Couple of more adjustments. Okay, are you comfortable? No, but I'm far beyond worrying about comfort. Am I looking at a federal rap here? If so, what the hell am I supposed to have done? Mr. Rockford, why don't you just cooperate? And if I don't? You gonna throw me in jail? You gotta stand in line for that. Well, if you just tell us the truth, you have nothing to worry about. (LAUGHING) You had a hard time saying that with a straight face, didn't you? I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to unhook me. No, wait, wait, just a damn minute. I can't. |I don't know, maybe it's stress, sleep deprivation. Hell, it could be PMS. The pills worked. I don't have a headache any more, but I'm gonna have to use the john again. No. You're just gonna have to hold it this time. (SIGHS) Now, did you know a private investigator named Bud Monckton? Monckton? What do the Feds have to do with him? Mr. Rockford, this is not your first polygraph. You know how this works. I ask a question, you answer, yes or no, because that's the only thing that registers. Now, did you know a private investigator named Bud Monckton? Yes. Did Mr. Monckton telephone you on the night of the murder? You had a bug on Monckton's phone? (LAUGHS) You did, you did. You were wiretapping him. Mr. Rockford... Legal or illegal? (BANGS TABLE) All right, all right, all right. Sorry. Ask again. Did Mr. Monckton telephone you on the night of the murder? Yes. Did he tell you he had some information that he wished to sell? Yes. Did you go to his residence per those instructions? Yes. And did you purchase that information? No. No? No. He wasn't home. You didn't see Bud Monckton? No. He's telling the truth. He didn't sell you anything? He didn't sell me anything, he didn't tell me anything. He wasn't there. Damn. Can I go now? Yeah. Back to jail. (EXCLAIMS) You ever wonder why they call it the justice system? I wonder that all the time. You know, I've never known anybody named Millard before. You don't know me. That's true. But if I did, I bet we'd be best friends. You know, I'm starting to understand why Chapman wants to put you away. (TIRES SCREECHING) (YELLING IN SPANISH) Out, out, out, out! Vamonos, Vamonos! (GROANING) JOSELITO: Now, now, vamanos! Come on, come on, come on! Now! (YELLING IN SPANISH) Which one of you is Rockford? Well, looks like we're gonna go international. I'm Rockford. You come with us. No, he's not going anywhere. This man is my prisoner. He's in the custody of the FBI. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Lose the cuffs. Nuh-uh. You want me to do it? You're liable to get hurt. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (LAUGHING) Okay, listen up. This how it goes. You two are going to walk over to the bus stop. When you get there, you wait. You take the first bus that comes along. That way, you get to live and you have a real nice story to tell your kids. (MEN LAUGHING) And this is not gonna happen. I represent the federal government... Or I pop you, right here. Your choice. You better start walking, Millard. I'd go with you, if I could. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Nice suit, gringo. (ARGUING IN SPANISH) (SHOUTING) (SCREAMS) Do you have a problem with the concept of private property? No. Good choice. Well, you care for a taquito? (LAUGHING) A taquito? Yeah. I haven't eaten in two days, Jess. All I've had is about 10 gallons of genuinely bad coffee that's now starting to dissolve my stomach lining. Need something in there to soak up the acid. Well, a taquito should certainly do that. ROCKFORD: Two taquitos. So, on the phone you said you were in trouble. Yeah, that's me, master of understatement. Are you talking new trouble? More trouble? What? It doesn't seem possible, does it? Thank you. Jim, the last time I saw you, the FBI had you in handcuffs. Yeah? Well, they still do. What happened? Well, it's a little complicated, but Chapman can now add grand theft auto to his list of charges. You didn't steal a car from the FBI. It was either that or be kidnapped. (LAUGHS) You know, Rocky never understood why you wanted to be a private investigator. I have to admit, I don't either. I don't know how you go through that all the time. You think this is my average work day? If it were, I'd be dead in a week. Where's the rental? Around the corner, end of the block. It's not a rental. I'm driving my own car. That's no good. I told you to rent one. I can't leave you without a car. Well, I don't intend to be left. Then I don't intend to take you with me. Damn it, Jess, I'm running from the cops, the FBI, and a cast of thousands. I... I'm wanted for murder. You could be charged with aiding and abetting. You could be looking at serious time. You don't like my terms, you better call somebody else. Oh, why don't you call your friend Becker? No, no, no, he's a cop. He'd have to turn you in, right? Yeah. Oh. What about your attorney, Beth? (SMACKING LIPS) Wouldn't work, either, would it? Because as an attorney she's an officer of the court, and she'd have to turn you in, too. My, my, my, my, we have a real predicament here, don't we? I'll drive. Okay. JESS: Jim, I really think this is a mistake. I mean, the Highway Patrol is always all over the place. ROCKFORD: I'm not going anywhere near the cove. According to what, I hope, is reliable information, Angel should be right along here. Here, here it is. This is a step up for him. His last place had cardboard walls. You sure he'll take you in? I'm sure. (DOORBELL CHIMING) So, he must be a really good friend. Angel? He'd sell me by the pound if he had a buyer. He owes me. Jimmy, what are you doing here? Who told you how to find me? It was Pastorelli, wasn't it? That guy doesn't know the meaning of keeping his mouth shut. This is my punishment for even talking to that creep. Did anybody see you come in here? Nobody saw us. Okay. Well, just don't stand around out here waiting for some gardener to make a positive I.D. Get in, get in! Angel, this is Jess Wilding. Who cares? It's not like you're gonna stay. ROCKFORD: Angel? I can't hear you, Jimmy. Can't, can't hear a word you're saying. Don't try to talk me into nothing. Every time I get something good going, you show up. You're like some giant cat who's all the time leaving dead rats on my doorstep. What am I supposed to say, thank you? What do you think, I can't come up with enough dead rats on my own? What the hell are you talking about? You're hot, man. You got that wanted smell. You're all over the tube. They got an APB out on you. What, you didn't know that? Well, that's one dead rat I ain't getting nowheres near. Just keeps getting better, doesn't it? Where's the TV? Where is it, Angel? I won't tell you. You think I'm gonna let you squat here watching television while they're putting your picture up in the post office? You're making me an accessory after the fact. Well, look on it as a refreshing change. You're usually an accessory before the fact. Don't make me call the cops, Jim. I don't want to do that. It's not like there's a reward out. Why don't we get out of here? You heard what he said. If there was a reward out on you, he'd turn you in just like that. Like you wouldn't. I love these holier-than-thou types. Where's the TV? Is this the channel where you heard about the APB? Yeah, they keep cutting in with these bulletins. Like, who cares about some guy nobody ever heard of killing some other guy nobody ever heard of? Where's the remote? I'll make a deal with you. Just hand it over, okay? You stay here until the next update, and then when you're brought up to speed, you're out of here. I'll make a deal with you. You hand me the remote and I won't break your arm. You're not making any friends here today. You know, the next time you need me, I just might not be there for you. You're not there for me now, Angel. It's on. It's a bulletin. Turn on the sound. FEMALE REPORTER ON TV: ...where the vehicle had been abandoned at Sixth and Alameda. The discovery was made by a police officer on routine traffic control. To recap this late-breaking story, private investigator, James Rockford, charged with the murder of fellow investigator, Bud Monckton, is being sought tonight by both the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI. At a news conference held earlier today, Captain Chapman had this to say. The murder apparently resulted from a longstanding and bitter business rivalry. Both Bud Monckton and James Rockford specialized in low-end divorce work. There was a history of violence... How can he say that? ...between the men that ended tragically... I don't take domestic cases. ...with the death of Mr. Monckton. I would ask any citizen who sees this man to report the sighting to the police. Under no circumstances should anyone attempt to approach Mr. Rockford. He may be armed, and should be considered dangerous. (REPORTERS CLAMORING ON TV) That's a terrible picture. Tell me. Again, an all points bulletin has been issued for James Rockford, primary suspect in the murder of Bud Monckton. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming. What are we going to do now? Damned if I know. (SIGHING) You all right? Mmm-hmm. Just decided to shut up and be supportive. You better go home, Jess. What, and leave you here all alone to have all this fun? You know, I'm usually pretty good at this sort of thing. I mean, I make my living at it. But I don't know what the hell's going on here. Every time I think I'm getting a fix on it, it morphs into something completely different. What are you doing? Did I say sit down? Did I say, make yourself comfortable? You guys gotta get out of here. The welcome mat is not out. Before you burn this particular bridge, you better make damn sure you're not gonna need it again, because when it's gone, Angel, it's gone for good. Now, he threatens me. This from a man who knows that I'd give him the shirt off my back. Why not? It doesn't belong to you, and neither does this house. All I'm asking for is a few square feet out of a possible 5,000. I can't do it, Jimmy. I mean, it kills me to say this, but you guys gotta move it. The caterer's here. The caterer? Nothing fancy. Pigs in the blanket, a couple of dips. But they want to set up out here, and now that you're among America's most wanted, well, they just ain't gonna get it. Angel, I wouldn't last 10 minutes out on the street. Put me in the maid's room, the garage. Just till dark. I'll take my chances then. Oh, Jimmy! Hey... I'll owe you, Angel. Wouldn't that make a nice change? Why me? Because, deep down, you're a really nice person. I know that. All right. Come on. Now, when the party gets rolling, you got these types that like to look around, so I'm gonna put you in the back where there shouldn't be too much foot traffic. I know it's none of my business, Angel, but what are you doing here? You're living like Donald Trump, you're throwing catered parties. You can't afford to give a party. I can't afford not to give one. Invite the right people. That's how deals are made. That's how careers are born. Now, when it comes to the caterer, well, that's bare bones stuff, like I said. What costs is the hard stuff, but I'm not serving that. It's just wine and name brand mineral water, and Mr. Brophy's never gonna know it's gone. Mr. Brophy is the owner here? ANGEL: It's one of those Mr. and Mrs. You-Can-Go-To-Hell divorce cases. You see, Mr. Go-To-Hell said that I should stay here on the pad while he's in London doing business. He's afraid that Mrs. You-Can-Go-To-Hell is gonna slip in and slide off with the family silver, and he wouldn't give her a pickle fork. Is this where you're putting us, huh? In this wine cellar? Yeah, until dark. That's our agreement. How are we going to know when it's dark? There aren't any windows in here. Yeah, and no one'll see you, and no one's gonna blow the whistle. You want to lay low? Don't get much lower than this. Here, chill. Have some vino. Mouton Rothschild? 1961. You're not serving this, are you? What's wrong with it? Well, nothing. It just goes for seven, $800 a bottle. What's the white he's got? Conti Montrachet, 1987. Oh, hey, that only goes for $800 a bottle on up. That should go very nicely with the pigs in a blanket. Seems to me you've got enough to worry about besides what I choose to serve at my party. I just worry that you're serving it from somebody else's wine cellar. You pop just one of those corks, Angel, it's grand theft. You just run on down to the police station, and then you can turn me in. (CHUCKLES) Hey, maybe we can do time together. Be like old times. That is, until they drop a pellet on you. Chin-chin. Regular Hallmark card, isn't it? Yeah, I'm almost tempted to open one of these if I didn't feel so sorry for Mr. You-Can-Go-To-Hell. You have no idea the damage Angel can do without even trying. Jim, I've been thinking about this. The police don't have an APB out on me. I'm not on any wanted list. Why don't you tell me what you would do if you could do it, and let me do it instead? Oh, no, that's very nice, I appreciate that, but nothing... I'm a very capable person. Capable has nothing to do with it. You don't know what you'd be dealing with here. Neither do I. I know it got one man killed and put me in a frame I can't seem to break out of. What are you suggesting? That we just give up? No. Well, hey, I don't know. Damned thing doesn't make any sense. Everything makes sense if you put the pieces together right. Okay? What's the first piece here? Linda Gustavo, she hires you. Only it turns out there is no Linda Gustavo. You know, I've been thinking about that. I mean, she really put on a convincing performance. She conned me into taking a job I swore I'd never go near. An actress. Well, enough of those running around this town that could use a gig. She could be the one that dialed 911 and told the cops to look in the trunk of my car for the gun they planted there. But who hired her, and why? I don't know. But my gut feeling tells me it has something to do with Felicidad Records. I mean, there's something weird about that company. Mmm. Music-business word is not uncommon. No, no, it goes beyond that. Why is there a huge framed photograph of President Reagan hanging in the executive john? They're Republicans? Clandestine Republicans? Why wouldn't they hang it in a place of honor? Why do they have these satellite photographs of the rain forest or some damn thing? And surveillance photos? I don't know. Really confusing, isn't it? I'll tell you something else. There's enough Latins running around in all this to do a remake of one of those old Fox musicals. Whoever Linda Gustavo is, she pointed me directly at Hector Gustavo. Or Felicidad Records. Or... Bud Monckton. Yeah, you see? You see, this whole Bud Monckton thing, that's a real sour note in all this. I mean, the FBI should've never even heard of a slimeball like Monckton. They not only knew about him, he had some information they wanted. You sure you don't have any aspirin? I'm getting my headache back again. Forget your headache for now. We're on to something here. You want to tell me what it is? Bud Monckton. You didn't know Hector Gustavo, you didn't know Felicidad Records, but you had a history with Bud Monckton. A violent history, as Chapman would say. Somebody wanted to off ol' Bud, for reasons yet to be determined. Put me in the picture, you've got the perfect patsy. That's not bad for the IRS. Thank you. (EXHALES DEEPLY) I've had so much coming at me from all directions, I guess I went into overload and shorted out. I don't have any answers yet but I know where to find 'em. Six for the road. Service door at the end of the corridor. Turn out the lights. Adios. Pigs in a blanket. (LAUGHING) Jim, who do you think would want to kill Monckton? Anybody that ever met him. (CHUCKLES) No, you gotta narrow it down a little bit for me. Now, whoever killed Monckton is the person who's framing you. Well, it's beautifully cold blooded, you know. I mean, steal my gun, use it on Monckton, and plant it back on me. Nothing personal. I'm just in it to take the fall. That sounded a lot like admiration. Well, hey, you'd almost have to admire anything that's put together with that much thought and precision. It's put together like a Swiss watch. There's the murder weapon, there's videotape of the two of us wailing away at each other in the hall, more video tape from a security camera at Monckton's house clocking me in at 9:45, the night of the murder, and never clocking me out. Why not? 'Cause I left by the back door. Now, either he didn't have a security camera on that door, or it wasn't working. But anyway, gunshots were heard at 10:30. Now, I have nothing to prove I was anywhere but right there pulling the trigger. If I make it, I'll call you. No, no, no, wait. I want to go with you. No, no. No, Jess. No, Jess. Yes, I... You can't afford to say no. You don't have a car. I will, just as soon as I hot wire whatever's in the garage. Hey, when you're in as much trouble as I am, it's really kind of liberating. (SIREN WAILING) Damn. CHAPMAN: You know how lucky you are? Well, no, Chapman. Just how lucky am I? Flight to avoid arrest when you're wanted for a capital crime? You could have been shot. Well, you're handling your disappointment well, I'll give you that. You think of yourself as some kind of great comic, don't you? Well, you're not funny. You've never been funny. Oh, sure I have. You've just never heard my best material. I save it for the dinner crowd. Come on, let's get this over with. It's been a long day. And a busy one. Two GTAs in six hours, and the last one has an interesting history. It was reported stolen two weeks ago by a Mrs. Lenore Brophy. Her husband stole it, not me. And I have it on very good authority, he wouldn't give her a pickle fork. Jim... We don't need you here, Lieutenant. Yes, I was just escorting Mr. Rockford's counsel... She knows the way. And when did it become Mr. Rockford? What happened to Jimbo? You're here to see if you can do anything for your old buddy, aren't you? No, sir. I'm just escorting Miss Davenport... Van Sant. Well, you can't do anything for him, Becker, so don't even try. Not if you give a damn about your career in law enforcement. Now, take a look. There's a lesson to be learned here. You know what that lesson is? Try "Crime doesn't pay.‚Äù Hey, uh, thanks for being here, I... Nice dress. Maybe not for this occasion. Are you going to start with me again? I was at a dinner party. Actually, I was the hostess. I had to walk out on my husband and all my guests. I used to eat dinner. All the time. What'd you serve? Give me the menu. Start with the hors d'oeuvres. Jim, you getting hysterical or something? How do you feel? Like Job without the boils. They ought to be popping out any minute now. That's 5, 10, 11 12, 25, 35, 36, 37. That's $12.37. Make you nervous walking around with all that cash? I want you to make a list of everything that goes into that property envelope, and ask the sergeant to sign off on it. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Listen, if I could just... It means, the last time I was a guest of this establishment, a silver money clip went into the envelope and never came out. That's a lie. That's not a lie, Chapman. My complaint's on file. Excuse me... Shut up, Becker. You accusing the police of stealing your lousy money clip? You're not listening, Chapman. I didn't say that. I said it disappeared, that's all. I'm just asking for a little backup paperwork this time around. Jim... That's, uh, that's... That's what? You looking for some more charges? You've got too many to deal with as it is. Will you stop antagonizing him? What's the matter with you? All right, cut him loose, Chapman. What? I said cut him loose. He's got a witness, puts him at home at the time of the murder. What witness? A credible one, Captain. Miss Wilding of the IRS. I'm sorry. I would have come forward sooner. I just assumed that you had all the facts as a result of your investigation. Chapman never lets facts clutter up a case he's on. I'm sure there are any number of people that can corroborate me on this. The Sand Castle was open. There were all kinds of cars in the parking lot. And you say he got home when? 10:45. You see, I was waiting for him, so when he drove in, I looked at my watch. I decided it was a little too late to barge in on him, and I decided I'd come back another time. There's no way that Rockford could have shot Monckton downtown at 10:30, and get out to Paradise Cove by 10:45. Not even the way he drives. Let's start by losing the jewelry. Why? You're not going anywhere. The hell I'm not. The hell you are. Chapman, can I see you in here for a minute? Let him go, Chapman. But, sir, we have the murder weapon. His .38. His prints all over it. And he has an alibi for the time of the murder. Now, he could have been set up, Chapman. You cannot overlook that possibility. All right, all right, maybe I can't make the murder charge stick, but I've got a laundry list that will. Two GTAs, flight to avoid arrest. And the threat of legal action. You don't lighten up, he's gonna go ahead with that suit. You really want to take that into open court? It's gonna play like a police vendetta, and the department doesn't need that kind of trouble. Now, drop it, okay? Just drop it. Counselor, we will not be pressing charges against your client. Not this time. Becker, get your friend out of the irons and get him the hell out of here. Yes, sir. (LAUGHS) Do you mind waiting for me? I'd like to walk Beth to her car. Sure. I parked in the police lot. Bye, Beth. Bye-bye. I want to thank you for being there for me, Beth. Yeah. I want you to bill me. (LAUGHS) I will. There were a lot of people there for you tonight. Becker and Jess. She's a nice lady. I thought that was one of those politically incorrect words. Yeah, well, it is. But I can use it because I'm a woman. Is she going to be somebody serious? Jess? She was Dad's friend. She's your type. Yeah, yeah, I know. Let me ask you something. If you were describing a friendship you had with somebody, would you refer to it as a relationship? You know, using the word relationship instead of friendship, but mean friendship? Why don't you just ask her, Jim? Forget it. I'll call you tomorrow. What's that mean? Another four years, or just until you need an attorney again? The town's full of attorneys, Beth. It was just an excuse to call you. I've been looking for one. I wanted you back in my life. I've missed you. I missed you, too. You know what really threw me, Jim? You were the one who encouraged me to write the damn book in the first place. And then to not even read it... I read it, Beth. Oh, don't make it worse by lying about it, Jim. I'm not lying, Beth. I read it. Then why didn't you call me? I didn't like it. Well... I'm sorry, Beth. I... I didn't know how to tell you. I... I didn't want to hurt your feelings. Well, say something. That's so sweet. (CHUCKLES) It's stupid, but it's sweet. If you don't call me tomorrow, I'm gonna call you. Well, you saved my life in there, Jess. Thank you doesn't quite cover it. God, I'm glad that's over with. It isn't over. Not yet. We still don't know who killed Bud Monckton. I don't care who killed him. That may sound a little cold... Sounds very cold. I never liked the man. I didn't like him when I met him. I spent 20 years not liking him. He was pond scum. May sound a little harsh, but that's the way I feel. Jim, what would happen if the police arrested you again? They won't. Yeah, but what if they did? And what if it ends up in court? You testify, and... But that's just it, Jim, I can't. I can't testify under oath that you were home by 10:45. I didn't check my watch. I wasn't waiting for you. I wasn't anywhere near Paradise Cove. You... Lied. Want to check out Bud Monckton's? Well, there's gonna be some lock picking involved. You may want to wait here. (SIREN WAILING) Now, don't get your hopes up. Monckton's isn't one of those lofts that made Architectural Digest. (EXHALES) It's pretty bare bones. Will the police still have it sealed off? I'm in so much trouble, I don't really give a damn. You sure you don't want to wait in the car? So far, you're real clean on all this. Are you trying to make me nervous? How are we going to get into this place? This way. What about the security camera? I doubt if anyone's checking them now that Monckton's gone. But just in case, I'll take care of them on the way out. Watch your step. His office is over here, if that's what you want to call it. If we're gonna find anything, we'll find it here. Don't you touch anything, huh? If you do, be sure and tell me so I can wipe your prints off. Can you see? I'm fine. Let's go. You wait here. (GASPS) Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I should have warned you. It kind of threw me when I first saw it, too. I thought his obsession was reserved for electronic bugs. Oh, God. You don't think there's any around here that aren't in cases, do you? Not in his appointment book. Is that what we're looking for? Well, we're looking for anything that'll tell us who and what he was mixed up with. Felicidad Records, for example. You know, record companies make big bucks. Big bucks could mean a mob connection. They'd have the talent to take him out and fashion a very nice frame for me. Well, what can I do? Want me to check the computer? You know how? Where the hell's his appointment book? Everybody has to have some kind of calendar to work from. Well, it's probably in here. You said the guy was into electronics. Oh, yes. He's got everything in here, including his grocery list. It's blank. JESS: Well, this is where it was. It was erased, I guess. Ah, that's just great. Don't worry about it, Jim. I'll get it back for you. You said it was erased. It is, but it's still in there someplace. I just have to find it. (CHUCKLES) I'm IRS, I do this all the time. What'd I tell you? (EXCLAIMING) Scrolled ahead too far. Can you scroll it back till you come to an entry? Got it! It's for tomorrow. What does it say? If you thought the FBI connection was strange, I don't know what you're going to make out of this. What does it say, Jess? Jim, Monckton has a luncheon meeting scheduled for tomorrow with Senator Phillip Aspall. Oh, I think I better keep that meeting. ROCKFORD: Senator, would you mind telling us about your association with Bud Monckton? Well, I wouldn't call it an association exactly. I hired him to do a job for me. And the last time I talked to him, he told me he had the information I needed, but before he could deliver it, this terrible thing happened. I take it you're close friends? Oh, not really close. (LAUGHING) Not really friends, actually. Well, both Mr. Monckton and Mr. Rockford were private investigators, so that just naturally gave them a commonality of interest. Well, I can certainly understand how Mr. Rockford fits into the picture, but Miss Wilding, I hope you'll forgive me, your place in it somewhat eludes me. If the CIA budget is out of balance with the Congress, I don't quite see how the IRS gets into it. CIA? (CHUCKLES) Not that we wouldn't welcome all the help we can get, you understand. Excuse me. You said the CIA. Well, a proprietary for the CIA. Felicidad Records is a front. A prime example, as far as I'm concerned, of unnecessary government expenditure. They set up these front organizations, and they never pull the plug on them, and you and I have to go on paying for that with our tax dollars for the rest of our natural lives. I was elected on a platform of fiscal responsibility, and I'm damned well gonna follow through on that. Bud Monckton was investigating Felicidad Records on your behalf to put them out of business? That's right. And I could have, too, with the information he promised me in his report. Names, dates... All the figures we weren't able to get a hold of ourselves. All the information, all the facts that we needed that we couldn't get our hands on before. Incredible waste there. Have you ever seen their offices? (LAUGHING) I'm a United States Senator. I don't have an office anywhere close to what Hector Gustavo has. You know, I've been going crazy trying to figure out what this is all about, and it's so simple. It's the American Dream. JESS: How can you say a thing like that? The American Dream? I mean, Bud Monckton was killed, you were charged with murder. You could have spent the rest of your life in prison. There is a potential for corruption in anything, Jess. Even when it's painted red, white and blue. Nothing sinister about the dream or the good life. It's what some people will do to achieve it you have to worry about, and how far they'll go not to lose it. I'm afraid I have a problem with this. They just can't get by with what they've done. You thinking along the lines of yearly audits? If that's the best I can do. Oh, I think we can do better than that. Hey, what the hell is... Hey! What... How many times you been shot for making a dumb move like that? I'm sorry, Dennis, I didn't mean to freak you out. I just wanted to check with you one more time before you go in there. So you've checked. Are you sure you know what you're gonna do? Not really. In situations where I can lose both pension and credibility, I'm more into improv. Okay, okay. Lieutenant Becker, we have all been the souls of cooperation, as far as I'm concerned. We've made our statements. I don't know why you need anything further from us. I'm investigating the murder of an employee of yours, Mr. Gustavo. Surely, you want us to find the killer. But you have. That private investigator, James Rockford. It's been on the news, in the paper. Yeah, but you haven't read the latest edition. We thought we had a case, it fell apart on us. So now, we're back to square one, so we're going to do things a little bit differently this time. Is everybody here? 'Cause I want everyone. Receptionists, secretaries, maintenance, security. Anybody that works for Felicidad, in here. Why? Because I'm running an investigation. And that's the way I want to do it. All right, but we have to leave somebody on security. Won't be necessary, sir. My men will make sure that nobody goes in and out of those offices till your people are back in place. Now, I'm on a very tight schedule, Mr. Gustavo. I'd like to get out of here as soon as possible. BECKER: Now, the questions will be very, very simple... (EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) (CLATTERING) (GRUNTS) I want men at every possible exit, out of sight, low key as possible. We don't want to give them any indigestion. You got it? Let's do it. OFFICER: Right, Lieutenant. You, I want out of here. Chapman doesn't believe in cops taking their buddies along on busts. Hey, I'm the one that handed you the bust, Dennis. And if he ever finds that out... He won't. You got an anonymous tip, you got a court order, you found the tapes. Stellar police work. All I want is five minutes. Why? Because they lost, Dennis. I want to rub their noses in it. You're on the clock. May I help you? No, I see my party. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (LAUGHING) Well, well. Eleanor warned you, Hector, but here you all are. When you're running a rogue CIA operation, having a regular table for lunch, even at Rex's, is a really bad idea. Do you know how many people want to put you out of business? There's me, of course, Senator Aspall, the Ways and Means Committee, the FBI, the local constabulary. Even the CIA wants to tie a can to you. Yet, we all know right where to find you. You can leave voluntarily, Mr. Rockford, or I can have you removed. That always looks so awkward. You know what your major mistake was? You fell in love with your front. That's all the record company was meant to be. It gave you a legitimate excuse to run around Latin America, doing whatever clandestine dirty work you were hired to do. But show business is very seductive. You liked playing record mogul and the hype and the glitz a lot more than you were supposed to. You were willing to murder to protect it. Hector... Well, I'm here to tell you it didn't work. You killed Monckton for nothing. You thought if the Senator didn't get his report, he couldn't close you down. Well, he doesn't have to. The cops are gonna do it. We had nothing to do with Mr. Monckton's death. Sure, you did. You're amoral thugs. You decided to off Monckton the minute you had found one of the bugs that he hung on you. Me, you found in the newspaper. That vivid account of the stupid brawl that we had after the Goodhew Awards. Not as vivid as your imagination. Oh, and the car full of Latinos that you launched at me. (CHUCKLES) What'd you do? Did you con them into believing that they were doing something brave and wonderful for their adopted country? You promise them another Bay of Pigs? Oh, and the elusive Linda Gustavo. She's Linda Almeida. She's doing dinner theater in Santa Fe, How To Succeed In Business. (SIGHING) You know, Bud Monckton, he was certifiably stupid in every area but one. Bugs. That was his obsession. And the rumor is you didn't find everything he hung on you. The rumor is the cops found a secret stash of tapes that have you plotting his murder, plotting my frame. And the big rumor is you're going away for a long, long time. Have a nice lunch. ROCKFORD: Hey, Jess! Hi! (CHUCKLES) Hi. I wasn't expecting you. I know. I should have called first. Sorry. No, that's not what I mean. I was out fishing. I could've missed you. You catch anything? Nothing I wanted to keep. (BOTH LAUGHING) Well, this is for you. What? I mean, it's not exactly a present, it's just... Open it. Okay. Oh, a cuckoo clock. You're right, you're right. Rocky would have loved it. Since he isn't with us, I just thought, |I don't know, keep it in the family. Well, thank you. You're welcome. (SIGHING) You know, you've never come out and said so, but you want to know what there was between Rocky and me. No, no, I don't. About six years ago, I... I walked away from a fairly disastrous relationship. And unfortunately, when I walked away, I was left with this very fragile ego, and this inability to trust anyone, and so much anger. But, you know, Rocky was so... He was so warm, and funny, and infinitely patient, and he healed me. He was... He was the grandfather that I never even knew. He was my dad that I lost when I was 12 years old. He was my father confessor. He was my best friend. I'm going to miss him every day of my life for the rest of my life. He even taught me how to fish. (LAUGHS) He taught me, too. Hope you don't mind. I mean, he let me think of myself as part of his family. But you... You were the center of his universe, Jim. That never changed. There was never a moment in his life when you didn't come first. I have a feeling that you were a very close second.
