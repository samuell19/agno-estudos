[♪♪♪] And, uh, ahem. And my board of directors and I are convinced that somewhere on this earth there are still in existence persons of the primitive Stone Age. To verify our theory, we'll require the services of explorers who are indeed intrepid. That's us. We're decrepit. Shut up, chipmunk. Oh. This, as I was saying, is a job for real explorers. Well, we're your men, Mr. Bopper. We've explored the South Pole. The North Pole. Even the telegraph pole. [CHUCKLES] Shut up, tadpole. Oh! This map shows a portion of the Earth that is almost unknown. We believe you will find the cavemen somewhere in this area. Excuse, Mr. Bopper. The board is waiting. Oh, pardon me, gentlemen. I'll be back shortly. Well, now, let's see. Let me see. Let's study this map carefully. Very carefully. Now listen, fellas. This is quite a large territory. We're gonna have to square it up into sections. [ALL CHATTERING] Now, we'll start from here. Down here, we travel by boat. And we'll base ourselves right here. And from there we'll travel across the desert sand by pogo stick. Boy, did you guys leave yourselves wide open. I'm in the king's row. Crown me. With pleasure. [GROANS] Why don't you stop clowning now? Now, right here. Right here is the last known whereabouts of the dinosaurs. Go on, she's on television. I always watch Dinah Shore. You do, eh? Yeah. Why don't you stop? Hold on, now. Leave me alone, will you? What's wrong with you today? I don't know, my ear is stuffed up. Wait a minute, I'll fix it. Hey, your brains came out. Oh, no, I forgot. I put that string in so the wind won't blow the dust in my ear. Oh. Well, how does it feel now? Still stuffed up. Just a minute. How was that? Pretty good. What happened to you? That's the dust off your brain. What you need is a windshield wiper. What you'll need is an eyeshade. [GROANS] I can't see! I can't see! BOTH: What's the matter? I got my eyes closed. Get out of here. Go ahead. Get over there. Gentlemen, you must start right away. We are prepared to spend $50,000 for the project. And if you bring back photographic and documentary evidence, we will pay you an additional $25,000. ♪ It's a deal ♪ ♪ It's a deal ♪ ♪ It's a deal ♪ Hurry up. Wonder what's wrong with this. Oh, oh! It was an accident, Moe. I'll clean you up. Here, lend me this. That's all right, kid. I know it was an accident. I think you got a little ink on your tongue. Let me see. I have? Yeah. [GROANING] Wait-- Wait a minute. Oh, Moe... Man, it's hot. And my feet are killing me. I should've never left home. Oh, boy. [GRUNTS] Oh, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't-- Oh, I'm sorry-- What's the matter with you guys? Hey. What? I see something. Give me those binoculars. [BOTH GRUNT] Here. I see a dense forest. The trees are as thins as hairs. [FLY BUZZING] Great Scott! There's a big bat in the forest climbing amongst the trees. He's as big as an elephant! Boy, I hope he don't fly over here. Boy, oh, boy. What's the idea? In case it rains. Boy, oh, boy. What a bat! Why, you imbecile. I've been looking at the back of your head all the time. And there's a fly on it. I hope it's a fly. Yeah, it's itchy. Well, get it off. Get me the gun. Hurry up. Wait a minute. You wanna kill him? Mind your own business. Go ahead, Moe. Yeah, mind your own business. [GROANS] Oh, look! A footprint. And the toes point out like prehistoric man. Quick, get a camera. We'll photograph it. Hurry up. Right there. We found it. Oh, boy. Oh, boy, we're making history. Yeah, we-- Hey, lunkhead. You got the camera backwards. Oh-- Come on, away from here. [ALL CHATTERING] SHEMP: Oh, boy. [LARRY WHISTLING] SHEMP: Heep-eep-eep! [MOE SNORING] Meep-eep-eep... [SNORING] Meep-eep-eep... Oh. Aggie, Aggie. My angel. Your face is so beautiful. [SNORES] Your beautiful blue eyes. Oh, my sweetheart. My killy kalu bird. You need a shave. [GRUNTS] Oh. My darling. I know you love me. But you're too shy to say so. But the petals on this gorgeous flower will prove it. Oh, she loves me. She loves me not. Ah. She loves me. Aah! She loves me not. Ooh! Ah, my darling. I'll give you security. The most beautiful cave in Mesopotamia. What will you give me? This. Aah! What's the big idea? Wake up and go to sleep. Why, you pussy-willow brain. You ruined a beautiful romance for me. Lay down. [SNORING] Oh, a beauty. Oh, boy. [LARRY SNORING] Heep-eep-eep... Ah, good morning. [XYLOPHONE PLAYS] Oh, top of the morning to you. And a tap in the morning to you too. Look what we got for breakfast. [BARKING] Oh, boy. A dogfish. I hope it ain't got fleas. Quiet. Now you get this ready for breakfast while Larry and I go take a dip. Wait a minute. Did you take a bath? What's the matter, is there one missing? Go on, go on. Let's go. To the water. [BLOWING AIR] How do you like that? The fire went out. I'll fix that. Oh, my trusty little rock lighter. Don't fail me, baby. There we are. What do you know? A fish for breakfast, a turtle for lunch. Here, bring this in the house and give it to Shemp. I'll look around, see what I can find for supper. Oh! Kindling. Ha-ha. Look what we got for lunch. A turtle. Oh, that's swell. You're just in time to help me make butter. Is the cream in the churn? Oh, we're all set. Let's go. [LAUGHING] Meep-eep-eep! [BARKING] [LAUGHING] Wait a minute. I think it's done. Go and get the bowl. Here. Oh, boy. Grade A. Oh.

Here, ducky, ducky. Look. A duck. [MOE SCREAMING] [BOTH GASP] [MOE GROANING] Now listen. If you behave yourselves I'll have you meet Aggie's two sisters. LARRY: Are they pretty? I don't know. I've never saw them. [ALL GIGGLING] Hey. There's Aggie and her two sisters. [ALL GIGGLING] Looks like I'm going courting. Me too. Me three. Be still my beating heart. Onward. Onward. [ALL GIGGLING] Let's just ignore them, girls. [ALL GIGGLING] Aggie, Aggie! Hiya, toots. Oh, hello, Moe. What do you know? BOTH: ♪ We just got back From a dinosaur show ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ [CHUCKLES] I want you to meet my cavemates. Larry and Shemp. Please to meet you. I'm Aggie. I'm Maggie. I'm Baggie. You're tellin' me. Look, they're stealing our women. [STOOGES SCREAM] You stole our girls, you horse thieves. We want 'em back. Get in the cave, girls. [WOMEN GASP] I'll protect those girls to the last drop of your blood. Come on. Whoa! I'll man the gun. Ammunition. On the run. Attaboy. No, no, a little to the left. About a half-inch. Okay. That's it. Fire! [GRUNTS] [GASPING] Oh, boy. [GRUNTS] Let 'em have this blockbuster. Okay. A little over the left. [FLY BUZZING NEARBY] MOE: Little more. [FLY BITES] Ow! [GASPS] [GASPS] Wait a minute, Moe. There's an explanation. I'm sorry. What's the matter? Don't you know how to fire a gun? What's the matter with you? Get some ammunition, hurry up. Okay. You missed me! Ha! [WHIMPERS] Oh, boy, what a shot. Look what I found. Oh, eggs. Perfect! [EGGS THUD] Oh, boy, a bull's-eye! Look. [GROWLING] Get the poison gas, Larry. On with the gas masks. Here we are. Hurry up. Good. Got him. Hold still there, you. [ALL GASP] [ALL SCREAMING] [ALL CHEERING] [WOMEN CHEERING] How do you like that, Mr. Bopper? Splendid. Splendid indeed. You have proven to the world that there are still cavemen in existence. I'll go to the cashier's office and have your check drawn. Boy, oh, boy. Did we put one over. [CHUCKLES] Bopper will never suspect that we made that picture here in Hollywood. And with these false beards on he'd never dream we were the cavemen. [LAUGHING] So that's it! You! And you! [BOTH GRUNT] You miserable swindlers! [STOOGES SCREAM] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [STOOGES SCREAM] Guess I fixed them. [SCREAMS] [♪♪♪]
