Yes? - I'll wait over there. - OK. I'm Chieko Hamuro. Rinse. Chieko Hamuro, please. - Finished. - Thank you. Avoid alcohol for today... and don't go swimming. Thanks very much. - How are you? - Fine. Mr. Kurahashi... Rinse. - We'll have to extract it. Prepare him. - OK. Gas. Loosen her clothes. Give her the anaesthetic. Come with me now. - Where? - To the usual place. I can't tonight. You will come, I assure you. Not tonight, I beg you. I'll be waiting in the car. You are mine... remember that. Chieko... It's OK, Chieko... Chieko, I'll help you escape. He's waiting. I must go to him. Stay away from me. He's a devil! He's going to hurt you! No - I'm already corrupted. - Be quiet! - Wait... Spare me! Stop! - Please stop! - Quiet! Wait... leave me alone! Don't! Keep still! Stop! Stop! Chieko! Chieko! It'll be OK, Chieko! What are you doing?! - Awful! - Spare me, please! Help! Help! Calm down, or I'll kill her. - Help me! - Stop it! Wait! Stop it! Leave her alone! Stop it! Wait! Wait, please! What are you doing to Chieko?! Chieko! Stop! Stop! Wait! What are you doing? Wait! Stop it! For heaven's sake! Will you park my car, please? Chieko! Be brave! What happened? I killed the dentist. My car hit him! There's blood on it! I'll wash it off. Let's run away together. He's dead now. Help me! I was sure you'd come. I can't go tonight. Why are we meeting here now? I wanted to talk with you. I'm... happy. I'm not at all. It's just boring. I can't tonight. Please understand. Weeping? You're a coward. You're all mine now. Don't forget that. Let's go. Your world will open up. Let's go. Chieko! Chieko... where are you, Chieko? Chieko! I'm here! I'm here! I'll help you! Try to hide somewhere! Do you understand? Yes, I will! # Chopin's Etudes are like a cold wind, blowing through my heart. # # The blighted branches of the plane trees knock against my window... # # and the sun is all white in the cloudy sky. # # But why... # # are the clouds a dark russet colour? # The same colour as that blood. # My body sways and writhes to the rhythm of the tango. # # My white dream flows endlessly... # # and there are crimson wheels behind my eyelids. # # But why... # # do the tears of happiness... # not flow down my cheeks? Just a mannequin... A demon! A demon! Help! I have killed her. I have killed her. She was a slut! I... killed her. I have killed her. I killed her! I killed her! I have killed her. I killed her! She was a whore! She was a slut! She was a whore! She was a slut! Thank you very much... Don't worry. It's just mild cerebral anemia. - Here. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Your handkerchief...! - I'll give it to her. Next, please... Please... Hey, wait a minute! You forgot something! - This is yours. - Thank you. - Need a lift? - Yes, please.
