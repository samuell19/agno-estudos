- [Announcer] The Chester W. Hick Cup, symbolic of America's highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play, emblematic of moral rectitude and the eternal striving for excellence in the game of life. But lest we forget the admonition of Chester W. Hick (hiccuping) himself, "Young man, winning isn't everything", he cautioned. - [Man] Shit no, it's the only thing!

(snorting) ♪ Down to the crunch - Coach, can I bother you for a minute? - No. (coughing) - Even as we speak, your team, the City High Moose are preparing to attempt an upset over the Johnson High Eagles coached by your very former protege, Alan Arnoldi. Now my question to you coach is this. Do you get a feeling in the pit of your stomach that the ship has sailed? You know, that you're through? That perhaps this game, this very game may be your swan song? Sir? - Howard, Bruce. - Malone, the erudite field commander, his sagacity on and off the gridiron well known in these circles throughout his tenure at City has grown obviously tremulous over tomorrow's showdown with Johnson. (whistle blowing) - Captain Flitt, front and center. - [Flitt] Yes, sir. - All right, tomorrow men, is the biggest game of your lives, the championship game. I only wish that Chester W. Hick could be around to see his trophy returned to its rightful place. Chet, god rest his soul must have had an uneasy rest these last few years knowing his trophy was at Johnson High! Well you guys are gonna get it for us. Now I'm counting on you. Your school is counting on you. And Chester W. Hick is counting on you! Now what do you want? - [All] Hick Cup! - What? - [All] Hick Cup! - I can't hear you! - [All] Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup! Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup! - All right, hit the showers, come on! - [Team] Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup! - Now hold up a minute there. (whistle blowing) And remember, men, no nookie until after the game, you hear me? It saps your strength. - [Team] Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup! Hick Cup, Hick Cup, Hick Cup! Nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie, nookie! - [Alan] All right, Johnson High, let's go, boys. This is the year for the Hick Cup, let's go. ♪ Yeah it's getting down to ♪ It's getting down yeah it's getting ♪ (whistle blowing) (grunting) ♪ Down to the crunch (whistle blowing) - Gary, you all right? - Yeah I'm all right, coach. - All right, good penetration, good hustle. However, that was a late hit. Could cost us 15 yards. We don't wanna lose the game on penalties. Number two, Gary's our starting quarterback tomorrow. We wanna keep him healthy. All right, Gary. Don't let them push you out of that pocket. Hang in the pocket. Extra fraction of a second could make a completion. - Yeah, but Rose missed a hit, man. - Rose, tighten it up. He won't miss it tomorrow. All right, run it again. - All right, huddle up! Let's go, come on, huddle up. Ready, break! - [Player] On the ball, on the ball, on the ball. Ready! - That's a very worthwhile ambition, Kathy but are you sure the Peace Corps is still hiring? - Well if they're not, there's always Hump. - Hump? - Humans Under Mental Pressure. - Oh yes, of course. (chuckling) Perhaps you should reconsider college, Kathy. - Miss Reed, college will be just like high school. Everyone concerned with their own personal gratification. I mean where are the Berkeleys of today and the protest rallies? - Ah yes, I haven't had a good one since the war ended. - I really envy you, Miss Reed. Back in your day you had causes. - Yes. Yes it was exciting. Oh there was one summer on the Indian Reservation I'll never forget. (chuckling) The drums, the tepees, the Chief. - And marching on Selmo with Marlin and Sidney and Harry. Oh god, Miss Reed, that must have been an incredible experience! - Oh yes, it was stimulating. - What I mean, Miss Reed is, you've done it all. I mean you really had your head in the right place. Kids today, all they think about is sex and football. They're so shallow. - Oh I know what you mean, Kathy, I understand your frustration. Think of it this way. Football turns a boy into a man. - [Alan] Watch the run, linebackers, stick to it. That's it guys, come on, teamwork, looking good. - Set, hut! (grunting) - Ooh. - Coach, Coach Arnaldi! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm indestructible. - [Alan] Huddle up guys, team up! - I just wanted to say good luck in the game tomorrow and we're all behind you. - Well thank you very much, Miss Reed. See you tomorrow. - Mhmm. - All right guys, listen up. City's gonna run all day long tomorrow. I wanna see a nice tight D against a sweep right, okay. (laughing) - What? - Who's that? - Oh it's that little nerd from City. - What should we break first, his camera or his head? - Wait, wait, I've got an idea. Kathy. - Hi. - Hi. Are we glad to see you. - Yeah? - We've got this problem, see? - [Kathy] On the field or off? - [Jerry] It's the vanilla double dip with the camera and we could use some camouflage from you. - Hut hut! (whistle blowing) - [Alan] All right, all right, looks smooth. - [Jerry] Nice to see you out in the daylight, Weasel. See anything you like? - [Freddy] Check the mad looking threads. - Oh, hello fellas. - You look at this. Your mama dress you that way? - [Kathy] Hi guys. - Hi Kathy. - Hi, Kathy. - Oh, hi. - Don't you edit City High's school paper? - Ah, yeah. - Yeah, hey listen. I got something you could really get into. - You do? - Yeah. It's um, something that means an awful lot to me, and well, I'd like to share it with you. - With me? - Yeah. Whales. - [Weasel] Whales? - [Kathy] It's a terribly important part. - [Weasel] Yes, I think I read about it. - Moby Dick, Sperm Whale. Humpback Whales. (whistle blowing) - All right! All right, huddle up here, team up. (whistle blowing) Sweet move, Ronnie. Head fake inside really spun you open. - In, out. And in, out. - Tell you how important tomorrow's game is, championship game. You're going up against a rough, tough, well-coached football team. However, you look ready. Let's go out there tomorrow and beat City High fair and square. Let's keep that Chester W. Hick Cup right here at Johnson where it belongs. (team cheering) Hit the showers, boys. - Whoah, take it easy fellas, I'm wired here. - [Alan] How you doing, Jack? - Hey Alan. - Sorry you missed the practice. They're looking like pros. - Yeah, can I ask you a few questions about the game? - Sure. Shoot, anything for the Cavalcade of sports. (clearing throat) - Coach Alan Arnoldi, as you stand at the pinnacle of your short but illustrious career, poised to lead your charges once more into the fray, so to speak, against your arch-enemies the City High Moose, coached by the dreaded Bulldog Malone, my question is this. Do you anticipate a tension-filled encounter or is it as they say, how you play the game? - Yeah. See you tomorrow. (light rock music) (hooting and cheering) - Yo, Pigger. (snorting) (humming) - Hey Flitt, what time's the pep rally? - Eight o'clock. OT, if you don't get out of my mirror, - It's gonna reject your face. - Get out of here. - Hey be cool, my man. I'm as pretty as I'm gonna get. Hey Pigger, you going to the rally? (snorting) Ah, you ain't the only one. Nobody's gonna sleep tonight. - Diane. Can I borrow your blue shirt tonight? - Sure. - How do you wear those tight jeans? Doesn't it drive you crazy? - Yeah. - That's too much butt out for me. - He took me to the Chem lab. - Yeah? - Yes. There we were in the dark and he's telling me how much he loves me. He says he's crazy about my hair, my eyes. - Wow. - Then we kissed and I felt his tongue going down my neck and over my shoulders. - [Woman] Oh you're kidding, my god. - What happened next? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Little bastard got his braces caught in my bra. (laughing) - Now remember, I stuck my neck out for you guys. I almost got killed for this. - Man, that's what we sent you there for. - [Man] Just throwing the first time. - [Man] What the hell's that, Weasel, your family portrait? It can't be, they're too good looking. - That's Holbeck! I can tell by the way he's smiling. - Something obviously went wrong. (buzzing) (groaning) - What's going on in here? Do you have permission to use this machine after school? Don't you know there's an energy crisis? Don't you know that electricity cost money, huh? You got a note from the shop teacher? I didn't think so. You just got no sense of responsibility, you hear me? Well next time, you damn sure better get one. (groaning) (light music) - [Mom] All right, Mom speaking. Now listen, you Johnson people, stay on your side of the room, and you City people stay on yours. We don't want no repeat of last year's action. Took me two weeks to get the place back in shape, got it? - O'Toole! Hey man, you remember last week when you and Pigger force fed Weasel 20 hamburgers? - That was too much. - Yeah it was, wasn't it. You remember the mess it made coming back up? - All over the walls. - All over the walls. Well I was here till two o'clock in the morning cleaning it up, O'Toole. Don't let it happen again, man. - Okay. - Stupid kids, ha Sheila? - Must be, Mom, they're eating your food. - Murph, look at the jug. Look at the jugs on that one, huh? Hell, if they had girls like that when I was growing up I wouldn't be packing heat today. Ever see what happens to them after they smoke that marijuana? They get crazier than chicken ice cream. You know what I mean, partner? - [Murph] I've gotta go to the can. - What's the matter with you? You're always hitting the can. Keep it up and they're gonna name a stall after you. (giggling) - You know those City High girls, they're really beautiful. I'm sorry, I'm kidding.

What'll it be for the City High Flash? - Oh let me see, I'll have a coke and some fries and uh, you to go. - Hey listen, you know the price is high and the goods are choice. You think you're up to giving it a shot? Oh, hey lover. - Hey Sheila, you miss me today? - No way, Mandel. - She's crazy about me. - [Flitt] Yeah, sure shows. - Hey hon, how you doing? - Ah, better than most. - Well you sure looking pressed and spiffy today, I must say. - Yeah well you're looking pretty foxy yourself, you know. - Thank you. - I hear the Precision Prancers are gonna perform at half time like last year. - Hey listen, you know we did have fun last year. - Yeah, until the riot busted out. Drink it. That's why you're in the can all the time. - You ready to order? - Oreos, green peppers, a burrito with sour cream. A couple cheeseburgers, heavy on the chili. Strawberry shake, order of onion rings, and a grape snow cone. - Oh god, Murphy, ugh. - Sheila, do you have any chicken ice cream? - I wanna stop now. - Come on. Damn, I've gotta meet Mandel at Mom's. Come on, we don't have time. - I wanna talk. Okay, if I'm gonna expect others to become committed, I've gotta set an example. I've gotta make a personal sacrifice. - Sounds reasonable to me. Come on, we've only got 14 minutes. - Gary, I'm thinking of abstaining from sex. - You're what? - We better get down to Mom's. (chattering) - Hey, by the way, where is Pigger? (crowd chattering) (whistling) - No, call me Mom. (snorting) Don't have all. You know, eating up all the puffers ain't gonna help me put you through medical school. Don't talk back to your father, now get out of here. Eh. Kids, could have had a Dobermann Pincher instead of that big mouth there. - [Woman] Yo, there's Pigger! - [Crowd] Pigger, Pigger, Pigger, Pigger. - Yuck, that's Pigger Peterson. - Is he ever ugly. - He's dangerous. - [Man] Hey Pigger, how about some chow? - Hey, hold on Pigger, that's already spoken for. Hey! - Hey Pigger, don't start nothing you'll be sorry for later. - Everybody keep cool. - The guy's a lunatic. - [Man] That's our food, Pigger! Put your beef through nagahai! Go for it, wild man! - [Cop] Who ordered this? - [Murph] Looks like he chewed it for you. - Remember what the coach said, no violence. - [Man] Have a seat, Pigger! - [Man] Do it for City, Pigger. - He wouldn't dare do it. - Oh my god. - Revenge is gonna be sweet against you City High clowns. (laughing) - You just ruined an officer of the law's lunch. I'd lock you up and swallow the key. Now take that back to the kitchen and get me another number two. - Can't you ever chew your food like a normal human being? Is that too much to ask? (laughing) (clapping) - Come again! Don't worry, we'll get the tip. - Hey guys, where you going? - Plenty here where there's gonna be a war. (laughing) - What happened? - Pigger. - Hey Sheila, we'll have two orders of fries and a large chocolate shake, two straws. - Yeah sure. Well listen, your chocolate shake's over there somewhere between Bob and Linda. You might find your fries on the dance floor behind the pinball machine, there's a couple on this wall. - [O'Toole] That was some sweet stuff. - We could sucker in their lineman like that unless they decide to blitz. - [Gary] We're gonna trap the five should whip. - You know, that Kathy Wilton has possibilities. - Man, you could forget about that. That's Gary Leonard's girl. - Oh yeah? Ten bucks says I can get it on with her before kickoff tomorrow. - You're on. - Well, if they blitz, I'll call an audible at the line. - Have either of you two boycotted lettuce lately? - [Mandel] Well we could do a quick pitch to the fullback. - Yeah maybe that'd work but I don't think so. - Excuse me, I'm going to get some air. - Maybe we could have Blunt run a play over here. - [Gary] Or I could throw a quick screen off the play action pass. (slapping) - Oh, hi Kathy. I hope you don't mind. I'm going to use our conversation as my next Man on Campus piece in the Gazette. - No, we could use the exposure. - Your concern centers on the sperm whale. - Yeah, both species-- - Wexler. This must be the lady you were telling me about, one who's enough to Save the Whales group. - Ow! Um, Kathy Wilton, this is Richard Plitt. - Hi, Richard. - Hello, Kathy. - Now back to my Man on Campus piece. I can just fill in the holes. - What? - You know Kathy, there are far too few of us concerned with what we are doing to this world. Look, I was just on my way home. Can I drop you somewhere? - Um, I don't know. - Yeah, flank both receivers, go inside. - Sure, why not? If it's not out of your way. - No, it's no problem at all. - Sounds good.

Now, here is Jack Maguire with his Cavalcade of Sports update. - [Jack] Thank you, Ed. All right let's take some calls from the fans as we watch them here on the eve of the 31st meeting between Johnson and City High Schools. - [Stanley] Jack, this is Stanley. I just wanna say that coach Arnoldi of Johnson High is an idiot! An incompetent jerk, and a wet-- - [Jack] Hold it, hold it, hold it. We'll have none of that on my program. (revving) (humming) (gurgling) - Hello, Coach Arnoldi. - Hello Miss Reed. - Why don't you just put this on your tee and sink it deep? - Sink it deep? (screaming) - Come on, are you ready to lick the opposition? - Oh aagh! (parade music) - We're gonna win that Hick Cup, baby 'cause I'm gonna make an end run! - Oh, give me that cup! - Oh, god! All right, position, get in position, position! Hike hike hike hike hike! Aaagh! - That's right. - Oh come on, Bulldog. You've been threatening to quit for the last five years. - Yeah but this time I may just do it. And I tell you one thing. This time I'm gonna go out in style. Now we're in good shape for the game tomorrow. When that final gun sounds, old Chet's cup will be back where it belongs at City High! - Goddamn right. You know I get pissed off every time I think of Arnoldi holding on to our Hick Cup. - You got the last one, didn't you Frank? - Mhmm. - Yeah this one's on me, Ralph. - Got you covered. Bulldog, kick ass! - You got it, baby. - Hey I'll drink to that. - Here here! Hey Bulldog, remember the championship game back in 50? - I remember, I remember. - And what a back two we had. Christman. I'll never forget him. - We were a damn good then. - What do you mean then, tomorrow's the big day. Tomorrow we're gonna drive into the wall. Tomorrow's when we win, you hear that? City High tomorrow! - I'll drink to that. - Give us another round on me, Ralph. - [Ralph] Got you. Here you go. - It's hard. Well, just a little mug. - [Ralph] Got you covered. - [Man] A toast! To Coach Malone's lucky longjohn! (crowd cheering) - [Alan] Oh, plug that hole. Plug that hole! Oh! Goddamn, what'd you do to me? - [Miss Reed] Oh, screw the air brakes, go for it! (whistling) - Go in! Timeout! - Oh sorry, I didn't hear the whistle. - Jesus, look what you did to me, you bit me. You know what that means, don't you? - Oh no. - [Alan] Oh yes. - Oh no. - [Alan] Oh yes. - Oh no. - Yes! It's a penalty, unnecessary roughness, biting! 15 yards! - And a first down. - And a first down! Oh, dime play, dime play! Dime play! (shouting) (beeping) (doorbell ringing) - Richard! - Hi. - Hi, what a surprise. - Well. You know, after I left this afternoon I stopped by the bookstore and I picked this up for you. - Organic Faith Healing, oh wow! Richard, this is fantastic! Oh but you shouldn't have. These books are really expensive. - I knew you'd like it. Katherine, the truth is, I just wanted to see you again. - Oh Richard, I'm really touched. - [Miss Reed] Oh come on Coach, that's it. Come on, come on! (moaning) - [Alan] Touchdown. - [Miss Reed] Touch down. - There's more to life than just football. - You know, that's exactly what I've been trying to tell him. He won't listen to me. - Hmm. (car honking) - That's Gary. - Kathy, I'd really like to see you again. I'll be at Mom's tonight at 10. - I don't know. - Mom's at 10? (doorbell ringing) And remember, if you ever need me, all you have to do is (snapping) snap your fingers. (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Hi. Flitt! - Hey Gary, how was Tricks? - What are you doing here? - Just dropped by to deliver a book. - Organic Faith Healing? My work, Flitt. Take a hike. - Hey, come on, Gary. Let's keep the rivalry on the field, okay? Enjoy the book. - Thank you. - Good luck in the game tomorrow, Gary. See you around. - Yeah, right. - You'll get your horseplay. Come on, we're gonna be late for the pep rally. Hey, how did you get home from Mom's this afternoon? - I walked. - Belt. (slapping) Thank you. - Mmm. Oh Coach. Goodbye, Coach Arnoldi. - Goodbye, Miss Reed. (laughing) (rock music) ♪ She's life's fascination ♪ She never says much more than hello ♪ ♪ That's a lie - Come on, you're not serious. - You know, that's it. You never think I'm serious. That's why I'm taking a vow of chastity. It's a life decision. It says to everyone, she's dedicated. - But can't it start tomorrow? Come on. You know, I bet none of the other guy's girls are doing this to them tonight. - You know, you're right, they're probably not. Which brings up another point. I am sick and tired of being known as Gary Leonard's girl. - Look, I'm just trying to understand! - You don't understand! Okay, I thought I had explained it to you. There are just more important things in my life than sex, okay? - Kathy! Kathy! Name two. - Trouble with Kathy? - She's got a new cause. She's trying to drive me crazy. Or maybe she's just trying to become a virgin again, you know. - Ah, women. Sometimes they're a real pain in the ass. Hey, I've got a couple joints in my car. If you can't get laid, why not get ripped? Come on, we'll go over to Mom's. - Yeah. (laughing) - [Announcer] All right Johnson students. This is your principal, Mr. Orr speaking. It's getting late. Time to wind down this rally. - [Man] Hey Mr. Orr, you suck! - [Ralph] Hey, Bulldog, how's that kid Ferguson coming? - He's fast. But he's not as fast as Greenberg. - [Ralph] 90 yard run. And you threw the key block. - Remember? He should have turned pro. Greenberg was the fastest man on two legs. What the hell is he doing now, a goddamn insurance salesman. - [Man] Well, speaking of insurance, I gotta call my bookie. Good night, coach. Good luck tomorrow. - [Coach] Thanks Warden. - See you, Coach. - Take it easy, Carmine. You're late. - [Man] Grr, watch it, Arnoldi! - Good luck. - You too coach, good luck. - Who's taking Frank home tonight? - [Man] Not me, I took him home last night. - (sighing) Looks like I'm elected. Come on. Your horse is ready. - [Ralph] Goodnight, Bulldog. - [Flitt] Not only are you doing me a favor, you're doing your school a favor. - [Chris] Cut it Flitt, I'm doing it for the money. - [Flitt] Okay, you know the plan. - [Chris] Yeah I know it. Just relax, we'll keep him busy. - What's she hanging in for? - You don't think I'm gonna take Gary Leonard on by myself, do you? - Well I don't know, Chris. Maybe I should go home. My mom will kill me if I stay out all night. - Kim, you promised. - Yeah, but. - Look, there's no way we can get into trouble. It's two to one. - Don't you guys think we've carried this a bit too far? - Not when it comes to winning. Okay look, I put a bong and a couple of pipes in the glove compartment in the back. I'll pick up the truck from you after the game tomorrow, okay? (sighing) ♪ Oh there must be something more ♪ (revving) (crowd cheering) - Well, we're here. - Why are we here? - Look man, we volunteered, don't you remember? - Oh yeah, the Johnson High kamikaze. - Oh come on, man. Think of Malone's face when he can't find his lucky longjohn. Come on, he'd go out of his tree. - (sighing) All right, let's go. - Right, and remember, if anybody asks, we transferred yesterday. (crowd cheering) - And I don't want you coming here anymore! - Oh Mom, this is so embarrassing. - Oh, I've had my eye on you for a long time now. Or haven't you noticed? - Yeah I've noticed. But I know you're kidding. - Oh I don't kid when it comes to two things. - [Sheila] Yeah, what's that? - Football and my women. - Honey, stick to football. (sighing) - Sheila, two of Mom's specials and have yourself a coke on me. - Mhmm. - Hi Kathy. - [Woman] The things I've heard about the people who hang around that place, they're very fast. I don't want you hanging around that kind of a crowd. - [Woman] Oh come on. - [Woman] I've raised you properly, I want a beautiful girl. (blues harmonica music) - Yeah, play, play, yeah! Woo! (laughing) (belching) - There he is. Think we can handle them both? - [Kim] I'll try. - Hey guys. Wanna take a ride? We got Flitt's van for the night and we're gonna be really lonely in it all by ourselves. - Come on Gary, we ought to help them out. - Well if you guys aren't interested, I guess tonight just isn't our night. - Gary, please. - Yeah. Let's go. - Hey, all right! (harmonica playing) - [Chris] Welcome aboard. Care for a little something from room service? - Wow, this place looks like a motel. - [Mr. Orr] This is Mr. Orr, your principal, again. Johnson students, I am getting very, very annoyed. This rally has got to come to an end. Enough is enough! - [Man] Ah, no one's listening to you, you meathead! - [Kathy] Hey Mandel, wait a minute. Mandel, wait a minute, will you? Well at least wait until we stop. - [Mandel] We stopped. Okay, now let's go. - Duck! - Where are we? - Shh. Quick, in here. (chuckling) (mumbling) Shh! - My god. The girls' locker room!

We gotta get out of here, come on, get going. - What here, here? Oh man, we got to find Malone topless. - Yeah right, hold on a second. - [Freddy] Cousin! - [Jerry] Can't forget Malone's new panties. - Blows. - Beats me. - Guess this isn't my day. Ooh, it's chilly in here. I hope you don't mind if I snuggle up next to you. (giggling) - Damn I wish I'd been born a quarterback. - This sure beats solitaire. - I think this is the place. - Catch some lights man, it's dark here. Confidential, even. Key's gotta be here someplace, huh? You don't think he carries them with him, do you? - I hope not. Quick, quick! - We're in business! (laughing) - Let's go. Ah, yeah. Now you're talking, come on. Hold this. Come on, man, come on! Damn! Nailed it. (laughing) - His longjohns! All right! (sniffing) ah. Malone's gonna croak! Put it back. Come on man, let's get out of here. - Lucky longjohns, you belong to us. - [Mr. Orr] Johnson students, I am not going to repeat this again. This is Mr. Orr, your principal speaking. - You know Richard, I'm discovering how nice it is to be with someone who doesn't think that everything I do, everything I care about is some sort of joke. - Joke? Kathy, everything you do is special. 'Cause you're a special person to me. I admire a woman who sticks to her commitments. - We'll work together, Richard. We will make people realize that there are battles to be fought. Isn't it exciting? To know that a man and woman can be perfectly happy in a non physical relationship? (laughing) (clearing throat) - Come on you guys, let's see what you got. - [Chris] She means your cards, fellas. - Ten high. - Threes and sevens. - Zip. - Read them and weep. Straight flush. - [Mandel] Gary, I'm so glad you talked me out of going into the priesthood. - Down, hey! - [Chris] Hot stuff. Look at those legs. - [Mandel] I think I feel a draft.(laughing) - [Chris] This'll keep you warm. (laughing) - I guess the turning point in my life was when I saw Jane Fonda cohost the Mike Douglas show. Richard, stop it. - Well, I can't help myself Kathy, I'm so turned on by your mind. I've got to have you. - Richard, let go. - Look, you don't want me to stop, come on! - Richard, cut it out! - Quit wriggling around! - Get out of here! Go on, get out! You don't care about me. You only care about yourself. You're just like everyone else. - Hey, I'm not like everybody else. I'm the best. - You're the pits. Richard. Shove it. - Okay fellas. Let's see what you got. - Eight high. - Two pair. - (sighing) Looks like I win. Now we'll see who's got the joker. (honking) - [Mandel] What the hell was that? (snorting) - The women set us up! - Come on, let's get those guys from Johnson high! - The hell with the guys, let's go get the girls! - [Chris] Get out of here, Pigger! (shouting) - [Announcer] Good afternoon and welcome to the 31st annual Chester W. Hicks Cup Memorial Game. This is Hank Banks, your game announcer. We have a beautiful day for this important meeting between the Johnson High Eagles and the City High Moose. Principals Orr and Equirtzel have asked me to impart a few of the do's and don'ts for today's behavior. School spirit is one thing but let's not get carried away. There'll be no throwing of cans, bottles, cherry bombs, stink bombs, water bags, tire irons or other instruments of destruction. Persons doing so will be dealt with promptly. After all, this is only a football game. It's not real life. - I don't believe it, they even stole my panties. - Oh that's okay, so you better use mine. - Boy oh boy, am I tired. - Hey Kim just said nothing happened. - Plenty happened. You ever tried fighting off a whole football team? - Who won? - Are you kidding? No cheap sex for me. I'm saving myself for college. - [Hank] Attention, ladies and gentlemen, I want to make a few announcements. I'm happy to tell you that this year, once again, we will be entertained by the Precision Prancers. They seem to be a little late arriving. They'll be here. Now I've been asked to caution you. No one is allowed on the football field. Of course let's make an exception, the players. Any non playing personnel found on the field during play will be subject to a fine. - Hello. - Ooh! - Or imprisonment or both. No consumption of alcoholic beverages will be condoned. You don't want a repetition of last year's unseemly behavior. Remember the spirit of Chester W. Hick. - Oh that guy.

Starting squad's pretty strong. We have a good day for football, I think it's gonna be a good little game, thank you. - One other question, coach that's on the minds of all my radio listeners and that is the arm of quarterback Gary Leonard. Now rumor has it that he can no longer throw that long-- - Where are they? - Where's what? - Where are they? Get out of here. - [Alan] What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about Arnoldi. - I don't know what you're saying. - Yes you do! - We've been joined by Coach Malone. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch. - [Alan] Bulldog! - Where are they?! - What? - My underwear, that's what I'm talking about! - [Alan] Underwear? - Coach Malone really seems upset. Something about his underwear. - You're talking about your lucky longjohns, Bulldog? All the years I was playing for you, I wanted to take them myself. - Cheap shot, Arnoldi, cheap shot. - I never touched them! - Ladies and gentlemen, I really don't know how to explain this. Something about Coach Malone losing his underwear. How that will affect the game, none of us know. - [Hank] Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that the Precision Prancers marching band is late in arriving. But they should be here in time for your halftime entertainment. (cheering) - Nice lens cap, Weasel. - Johnson calls tails, tails it is. Johnson you've chosen to receive. City, you've chosen the west goal to kick from. - Okay, we'll kick from this side, let's go. - [Hank] Please rise and join Miss Gladys Dalrymple of the Daughters of the American Revolution in the singing of our national anthem accompanied by the dulcet tones of the Golden Straumberg Organ. ♪ Oh say can you see ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ at the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ Whose broad stripes and bright stars ♪ ♪ through the perilous fight - [Man] We're lost, Barney. - [Barney] I know, Phil.

(whistle blowing) - [Hank] Gary Leonard as quarterback lines up the Johnson High Eagles for the first defensive series of today's game. - Down! Blue 51! Check! Hunt! (whistle blowing) - [Hank] Leonard hands off to Mandel, a loss of two on the play. It'll be second down and 12. - Break! Down. Set! Green 88, green 88! Hut, hut, hut!

Now during this pause, let's have a word from Cavalcade of Sports' own Jack Maguire. - Remind you that at Mr. Tony's, a little bit off the top barbershop, there are never any lines, six chairs, no waiting, plus the latest selection of comic books. ♪ We got the spirit ♪ Come on let's hear it - [Hank] Johnson ball, first and 10 near midfield. ♪ I-R ♪ I-T ♪ We got spirit so let's hear it ♪ - Onslaught, check flair on two.

(crowd cheering) - Down. Down 22, two 22. Set, hut! - Set back defense, go get him. - Way to hit, JH. Nice shot. (cracking) - Come on, what the hell, are you blind, goddamit. You all right? - Yeah I'm okay. - All right, get in there. - We've got to stick these creeps before this gets out of hand. - Okay, open up to me you guys, let's go. You and you, I'm gonna take Leonard off the neck, let's go. - Down, blue 17, blue 17! Set. Hut, hut! - [Hank] Fumble. Reggie Wilmont, number 54 recovers for City High. - Hey! How about that, eh? - I'm going deep on you all day, Leonard just like I did with Kathy last night. Hey, did you ever notice that birthmark on her thigh? - Let me up, you bastard. - Come on guys, break it up. Get back to your huddle. - Very nice, thank you very much, yeah. Congratulations, a nice clean hit. - All right, settle down, settle down. Gary, what's going on in there? - Nothing, coach, nothing. - [Hank] City High first and 10 at the Johnson High 25. - Down! - I'm gonna pop your berries deep. Here I come, baby. I'm gonna chew you up, I'm gonna hurt you, 24, you better run 'cause you'll never walk again! - [Hank] McCormick loses three, back to the 28. Second down and 13. - One more thing, folks. Starting on Monday, Mr. Tony's latest customer convenience will be car wash service. - [Hank] The cheerleaders really add a lot to the game, don't they folks? - Down! Set, hut! (whistle blowing) - All right, all right. (clapping) - Down! A41, Blue 25, set! Hut! (whistle blowing) - [Hank] Interception by Ed Farmwick. Returned to City's 36 yard line where it'll be Johnson's ball first and 10. - Hey Leonard, I saw you at the drive in with your date. I think I heard her bark! - [Player] Hey, lay off, his girl's a saint. - Yeah, a Saint Bernard. - Blue 15! Set! Come on! (whistle blowing) - [Hank] Penalty by number 58, roughing the passer. Number 58, Richard Flitt. - Hey man, you're spending a lot of time on your back. But not as much as Kathy does. - Get the hell off me! I'm gonna break both your arms! (whistle blowing) - What, hold it. - [Hank] There seems to be a slight difference of opinion on the rose. - [Ref] Break it up, break it up. Come on, back to your benches, let's go. - [Hank] During this pause in play action let's begin with my good friend Mom's celebration special. - It's all over, back to the bench. - Break it up! - Let's go guys. - Move it, move it, let's go. - All right, back to the bench, come on let's go, come on let's go. It's all over. - Come on, get in your huddles now, let's go. - All right. - Huddle it up. - Come on! - Come on, let's move it, come on. Back to the bench, here we go. - We're gonna win this game! - [Hank] And we expect a good, clean contest. (bell dinging) (honking) (farting and honking) (boinging) (crashing) (boinging) (squeaking) (honking) (farting) - Hey! (thwacking) - Offside! (honking) (honking) - Shake it off. - Well this could be Johnson's last chance to put some points on the board before halftime. - [Hank] With less than a minute left on the clock before the half, it's still a scoreless tie. Leonard brings Johnson High out on the City 45 yard line where he faces third down and six to go. (snorting) - Learn that from a Berlitz record? - Red 56! Set! Come on! (crowd cheering) - [Hank] Touchdown, Johnson High! Leonard pass to number 81, deep ball. Hold on, there's a flag on the play. We have a personal foul, number 58 Richard Plitt. Penalty is declined, the touchdown stands. Johnson leads six to nothing. Gary Leonard shaken up on the play is being helped to his feet. And he seems to be all right. ♪ You know, we got soul - Poor boy. - [Team] Break! - [Hank] Mike Carron, number 59 is on to attempt the extra point out of a hold by Armstrong, number 21. Kick is up, it's good! - All right! - [Hank] The gun sounds, it's the end of the first half with the score Johnson High seven, City High nothing. Hungry? Well a quick trip to the north end of the stadium will bring you to Mom's Canteen. Yes sir, Mom himself is here to serve you his famous culinary delight, Mom's Mystery Meat Sandwich. Guess what you're eating and win round trip tickets for two to any City serviced by Amtrak within a 31 mile radius. Standby for the Precision Prancers expected at any moment. - I think we crossed the state line. - You're a lot of help. The highway is over there. - No, it's back there. - No, no. - This way, this way. - Ask Kettles back there. - Sure, here. - You're both nuts, hell with it. - You go straight. - [Johnson Player] That's pretty good, the way you City guys wear uniforms with your IQ on your jersey. - [City Player] Run into me in the second half baby and I'll plug you a one way ticket into never neverland. - [Johnson Player] I'll be on you like white on rice. Like fleas on a collar! Like crabs on your mama! (mumbling) - [Man] What's into him? - [Man] It means you can't make a baby, yeah. Ask your mom where your sister came from! - Gary! Gary! - [Alan] Go on Gary, hustle up. - Gary! Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Gary! I just wanna talk to you for a minute. - Why don't you save it for Flitt? He tells me the two of you were real close. - 31 years ago, I walked out on a football field and coached my very first football game. It was cold, I remember that. I had 23 budding young Americans under my arms. And I wasn't quite sure whether I could do the job. Hell, the night before the game I was sitting by the stove going with the plans and I felt very much alone. Well my mother, god rest her soul came over to me and put her hand in my head, and said "Bulldog, it's gonna be cold tomorrow, "these are for you." And she handed me a pair of red longjohns. You know, suddenly I felt stronger, more sure of myself. Well I wore them the next day and we won the game. I wore them the game after and we won that one. I wore them every game that year and we won the goddamn championship! Now I had been wearing those goddamn red longjohns for 30 years! And I'm not wearing them today, and you know why? Because some son of a bitch stole them! And I feel naked without them. Powerless! Like a quarterback without an arm. But what about you guys, huh? What are you doing out there? You're letting them beat the shit out of you! Now when you go back out there I want you to kick ass, all right? Kick ass! Kick ass, kick ass! Come on you pricks! Kick ass, kick ass! - [Team] Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! - I'll look for my goddamn underwear. - [Team] Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! - Jack Maguire, outside the men's locker room at City High where we'll bring you a behind the scenes view of the players at halftime. Oh, oh here's coach Malone. Coach, your team played terribly the first half. Now do you have any strategy for the second half? - Bug off. - The coach has just assured us. Just a moment. There's something strange going on. It is an unidentified female walking into the City High locker room. - [Team] Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! - Hey Flitt, it's room service. - Kathy! (snapping) - Ah! (whimpering) Can I have your name, miss? - Abdullah the Butcher. - [O'Toole] Okay Romeo, where's my 10 bucks? - Listen up, here comes the coach. - All right guys, come on, team huddle, hustle up. Listen up guys. All right. Bulldog's over there pissed off. You know why? Somebody copped his underpants, boys. (laughing) They're old, guys. I want you to know I played for him myself. He had them for 31 years so far and I don't think he ever washed them once. (laughing) (whistling) He's over there telling his ballplayers just how bad they are gonna feel if they don't beat your ass, guys. He's making them feel guilty. He's yelling at them. He's having them storm out his locker room screaming "Kill 'em!" And now it's the time you guys got now one more half of football to play, 30 more minutes. Everybody got a chance to go in there and put out a superlative effort. You gotta reach inside and find that hundred percent that you got. All right, guys. What do you say, Johnson High? (team cheering) All right! What you did out there was pure pigskin. Chewed them up, you're my guys, every one of you. I believe in you guys. - Uh, Coach Arnoldi. - Hi Jack, hi. - According to my sources, City High's defensive lineman, Richard Plitt will not be in the starting lineup this second half. Now will that affect your strategy? - Plitt's not starting? - No, no no. According to my sources which are unimpeachable, I may say, he was attacked savagely by a member of the female gender. - [Team] Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! Kick ass, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass! - Chester W. Hick Cup, you're all mine.

(whistle blowing) ♪ Big dog - All right! - [Hank] And City High is on the scoreboard following the razzle dazzle running of number 24 Skeez Jeffries, 92 yard kickoff return. Score is now Johnson seven, City six. - Lock it up, boys. How's Gary's shoulder? - I think he's good. - [Hank] Peters to attempt the extra point out of the hold by Bruce Edwards. - Set, 22, hut! - [Hank] It splits the crossbars! Game is all tied up at seven apiece. - That's our way to get 'em!

Kraznicki, the deep back for Johnson standing on his own goal line. (whistle blowing) He takes it at the 10. And he's again tackled on the 40. You can hear the bone splinter clear up here in the press box. Johnson, first and 10 at their 46 yard line. - Down! Red 41, red 41, hun! Hut! - [Hank] Beautiful hit by Pigger Peterson, City High's own med school hopeful. The play loses 10 yards. Back to the Johnson High 30 yard line where it'll be second down, 20 yards to go. - Down! Blue 12! Set! Come on! - [Hank] It's a 37 yard pass! - All right! - Out to Mandel. Johnson is on the 10 yard line. - Offside, Blue, take it back five. - [Hank] Offside against Johnson High. Penalty of five yards. It'll be second down and 25. Ford, license 3m2401, lights are on, your stereo's on, and someone's siphoning your gas. - I'm hurting down there coach, I can't go in. - Come on, come on, come on. Get up on your butt. - Flitt the shit's back in. - Hey. Let's say we run the draw play right up his ass. - How you feeling, Flitt? - Leonard's all mine this play. I'm gonna let my forearm get intimate with his face! - Break! Come on let's go, let's get it. - Hey Pigger. You look like an armpit that eats. - Green 17! - You're mine, Turkey. I'm gonna fold your eyelids back like a set of venetian blinds. - Blue 63! - [Johnson Player] Take a deep breath, Peterson, it may be your last. - Hut, hut! - [Hank] Leonard on in around. - [Player] It's a round! - [Hank] Breaks one tackle at the line of scrimmage. Sees some daylight. He's got one last shot at him. Oh, he broke that tackle! And he's on his way, the 15, the 10, the five! Touchdown! - Touchdown's good, touchdown's good. - Dammit! - All right! (whistling) - [Gary] Little jumping Kokomo rolling seven! - [Hank] Gary Leonard on the deep one went 62 yards for the touchdown. Johnson leads 13 to seven. - Gary Leonard with that spectacular run could prove to be the hero of the day. - Break! Down! - [Hank] Once again Carron on for the conversion with Armstrong to do the holding. - And the kick is good. Johnson 14, City seven. And the chicken's on the move. (clucking) Chicken. - [Hank] And if that's not enough excitement, the Precision Prancers marching band should be here at any moment. (parade music) - [Barney] I got a sinking feeling that we've been here before. (whistle blowing) - We're set to go!

(whistle blowing) - It's good! - No, the point is no good, it's wide, wide! - Gimme those! - Oh Coach Malone. - Stand here, Maguire. - [Hank] Since we appear to be in the midst of a minor break this year, there maybe a repeat of previous wars. - Right. Rivalries should stay on the field. (bashing) - [Hank] Please! I hate to see this sort of unsportsmanlike conduct on the field of play. Have you no sense of decorum? - Come back here, you turkey! Nobody see the kick? Come on, did you see it? - Come on, let's get out of here. - Come on, the kick was good. - It was wide, it was wide. - You're blind! Arnoldi, you saw the kick, it was good! (women screaming and Pigger snorting) (bashing) - [Hank] This is absolutely a final warning. All non playing personnel still on the field by the time I count to three will be promptly sorry. One, two, three! - Okay, heads up Jack. A couple more arrests here. All right, everybody inside Let's go, let's go people. Move it, move it, inside. - [Man] Gordon, is this another one of your routine arrests? - [Cop] Right up to the front. Book all of these people, let's go. - We were robbed! - [Man] You're lucky you're still alive. - [Man] Too bad you had to cheat to win. - [Cop] Right up front, right up to the desk. Book them all, book them all. Creating a disturbance. All right! (crowd shouting) - [Man] I want my lawyer! - Leave that there, that's evidence. All right, quiet down here, you're all under arrest! - George, that kick was good, you saw it with your own eyes, goddamit! Oh god, there they are. Give me those! - [Man] The kick stumbled out just like your underwear! (bashing) - Don't talk to me like that, George. - [Man] Come on, take it easy coach, come on.

Weasel's on TV with Jack Maguire. - [Man] Weasel? - [Man] That jerk? - [Man] They're both jerks. - [Jack] Are you implying, Mr. Wexler that you're in possession of irrefutable proof regarding the extra point in dispute? - That's right, Jack. - You wanna roll the film? Let's see for ourselves. - [Man] We tied! Yeah we tied! (cheering) Weasel Wexler for President! (cheering) - See you next year? - Ah, you bet, coach. By the way, congratulations. - What about the Hick Cup? - Hick Cup?
