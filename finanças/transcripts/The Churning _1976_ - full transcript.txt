For once the train came on time. How's work? Good. But the flies are too many. I hope they haven't fallen into the milk. How is Mr Mishra? Everything's okay. This is Doctor Manohar Rao He is here on an official visit. I'm glad you brought him. So much illness here and no doctor! He's not a medial doctor. He is a veterinarian. Can your horse manage such a load? Don't worry, Sir. He can carry twice as much. Come along. Nothing will happen to the horse. No, I'll walk. Is it far from here? Yes, it is. Never mind. We'll meet there. What's keeping you? Are you feeling sorry for the horse? [ Shree Ganganath Dairy Property of Shree Mishra ] Mr Mahapatra, your assistant is not with you? Assistant? He is not my assistant. He is the leader of the team sent here by the Dairy Board. He has come to set up a milk cooperative society. A milk cooperative in this area? I've said repeatedly that I know this region. But who listens? Only those with foreign qualification get their way these days. Experience has no value. Sound advice. But for these people it is like playing the flute to a buffalo. Don't worry. Young people are idealists. They want to change the world overnight. That's all very well. But it only shows their foolishness. This idealism is sheer nonsense. Experience comes with age. It is good that they have ideals or how will they lose them? It is a trait that's disappearing fast. This country badly needs dedicated youth. Jeevan, where are you hiding? Go, fetch my tea, quick. See if Dr Rao is up yet or not. -How are you? -I'm okay. -Is that your cow? -Yes, sir. -How much milk does it yield? -Four litres. Do you use it at home or do you sell it? We sell it. -To whom? -To the Mishra dairy. At what price? One rupee per litre. Just that? Is there a contract? Yes. -How has he fixed the price? -God knows. Jeevan, where has Rao gone so early in this awful cold? I don't know. Fine thing for us if he comes down with pneumonia. Is there anyone here? Boy, is your father home? The father is right here. What do you want? Is your husband here? But who are you? I represent the Cooperative Society. Do you own land or manage on what you earn by selling milk? The have-less children people came and went. Now what is it? Can I have a sample of this milk? Sample nothing! Just leave! All the villagers have agreed. A little will do. A little? Little by little you'll take the lot. Why are you following me? You're a thief. Rubbish. You've been stealing. You wouldn't give the sample. But you took it. You stole it! I'll call everyone here. Bhagla was there. I left the milk and went inside, and he stole some. An educated man like you, stealing. You citified dandies come to our villages to steal from us? Today you stole milk, tomorrow it will be something else. These city fellows are all rogues! God knows what really is in those bottles. MISHRA: What happened? Why the crowd? Stealing, what else! He stole milk from my house. Can't you see he is an honest man? Go home, all of you. Doctor, come with me in the car. Bhola, take these people away. -RAO: Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Are you acompanying Mahapatra? Yes. My villagers are like children. Please, don't be upset. -What happened? -I was collecting milk samples. I've heard you want to start a milk cooperative. The system we have currently is not satisfactory? Who can decide that? You must be an idealist. We have been living here for thirty years. All the villagers are my clients. I know each one by name. I know their financial conditions, how many in each family… When you leave in six months the Cooperative will collapse. In the bargain, my own business will be finished. And my ties with the villagers will be broken. Do you really think so? Mr Mishra, I have taken milk samples. I am certain they are rich in fat content. You buy their milk by weight, so the villagers add water to it. Your price is so low that they are compelled to do that. Mr Mishra, it is you who live off the cream. [EN] Young man, I have built the economy of this area. True. Your methods worked years ago. Today they are obsolete. What proof that yours will be effective? Progress is not necessarily brought about by change. We are not concerned with who owns the dairy. We want the benefits for the milk producers, who are all poor farmers. This can only be achieved with a cooperative. Doctor, I am like an elder brother to you. My advice is to drop this nonsense. You are a vet. Stay there and look after animals. Teach the villagers to lead a clean and planned family life. Our country's progress depends on high thinking, hard work… wholesome food, planned families. You say all this to prevent any threat to your business? Anyway, you are our guest. If you need anything, please, ask. MISHRA: If you like, I'll send brandy or something this evening. RAO: No, thank you. Come and have some tea. No tea, please. I don't indulge. -Where did you go? -To look at some villages. I would have shown you better, bigger villages. I still can, I must get dressed anyhow. Let's go. I have to wire my team to come here. Did you find the house easily? It isn't Taj Mahal but it will do. Is the method you followed in the past the only way? The Cooperative Society will belong to all of you. Ganganath Dairy is owned by the man: Mishra. Who benefits? Mishra. Managing it yourselves, this society will benefit all of you. The milk will go directly to the government dairy. That's 40 miles away! Once the coop is formed, we will arrange for trucks. Milk from 7 or 8 villagers will go in one truck. -Mr Mishra won't like it. -Not one bit. Because his profits will reduce and yours will increase. Who can join your society? Anyone with at least one cow or buffalo. Those with more cattle will have more rights? No. Equal rights for all. Members will together elect a commitee for collecting the milk, testing it, keeping accounts. It will have a chairman who will be elected by you. Our village head has 25 buffaloes so he should be chairman. This will be settled by votes. Doctor Sahib, I've been the village headman for 15 years. It is with my backing that the society is being formed. Is there no difference between me and these peasants? A coop does not discriminate between caste or class. These words are for public speeches. But sir, we are all out-castes. You think that will debar you from the society? Not at all. The cooperative is open to all castes. Forget the rights. Talk of money. When can we get loans? Don't worry, sir. We will vote for your party. Quiet! You will neither get money from us nor are we canvassing for any political party. Without giving loans, what use is a society? We are poor people. We need money. Give it later if not now. Stand up for yourselves and not beg for charity. Thank you, sir, for your kindness, but will that make us less poor? We only understand money, nothing else. Mishra gives us loans. Can you do the same? You can't understand what we are saying. We have understood! May I say something? What is it? I think you city people are crooks. What do you mean? Think what you like. I understand your kind. Your tricks won't work here! Where is Dr Rao's house? Dr Rao? Everyone out. -The lavatory? -Outside. Outside? Sir, I feel feverish, I think it's malaria. Not at all. I'll catch it soon enough. So many mosquitoes. You have a mosquito-net, don't you? Had I known this, I'd never have come. Sir, on my way here, I met a man with the face of a murderer. Probably Bhola. You meet such crazy people in villages. He won't attack you. Go to sleep. Who is it? I don't know. He's run away. Must be him, Bhola. Did you find the money that day? I left it near the door. Yes. But won't sell any milk to you. You prefer to deal with Mishra? He's a two-faced liar. Why is he crying? Son, what's you name? Bhagla. Why do you talk so of Mishra? Ask in the village. He cheats us all. Then it's better you sell to us. Stealing little at a time. God knows why. It's not stealing. I test the milk for its content. Do you mean I add water to it? My buffalo gives three litres. Crooked people think crooked thoughts. Where is your husband? Who knows? Must be lying drunk somewhere. I haven't seen him for 4 months. Quiet. Go inside. How many castes are there in this village? See, first our caste. Then there are farmers, potters, shepherds, Rajputs and barbers. The village headman, what's he like? He is an important man. Why do you ask? He doesn't help us at all. And this rogue, Bhola? Don't call him that, sahib. He sees city people and he gets mad. Why did he come here? How is that your concern? It's best to keep such people away. I know their ways. These people won't even let us sleep. They won't let us be… throw stones, bang at doors. Who is it? I'm coming! Doctor sahib, come, quick. -What's the matter? -My son. He is dying! He's burning with fever. My brother has gone to the doctor. The doctor will come tomorrow. By then it will be too… But I am a vet. When you can treat animals, you can treat people. Give him an injection. My Dhanie will be saved. Save him. Boil some water. And bring some soap. __ are you going to give an injection __ His condition is bad. [EN] Do you realise it's highly unethical? [EN] Do you have a better suggestion? [EN] You'll ruin us both. [EN] Hold the baby. By morning the fever will be gone. Give this note to the doctor. [EN] What's the time, Deshmukh? [EN] Six. [EN] Come, let's go. Is this the way to play with a human being's life? And if the child recovers? What if he dies? [EN] That's the risk one takes. You will drag me down as well? Sir, they are looking for you. Where is the animal? I need to be treated… But he is a vet! They've come for medical attention. But I can't treat you. You cured Moti's son. Please, make him well too. Deshmukh, my bag, please. Do you intend to set up practice? For some time. There isn't even a primary health centre here. How is the child? All thanks to you. He is well now. Sahib, we have come to enrol ourselves. -Who? -Us. How many? Look, Moti, 3 or 4 persons cannot form a cooperative. At least 40 persons are required. Where will they come from? They all go to Mishra's dairy. Please, enrol us in the society. Take this medicine. Doctor sahib, here is some milk for you. For me? You saved my son. I only did what I had to. You must take this milk. It's absolutely fresh. If you insist. But I will pay for it. Let me show you how milk is tested. The milk is pure, sahib. Not a drop of water in it. It's a gift from us. Don't think of water, then. Note the fat content. That's good. What's the quality? 2 rupees, 2 paisa for one litre. Mishra never gave us that much. He buys by weight. We buy for the fat content. Your milk is very rich. The more fat, the better the price. [ Current price: 1.60 ] BINDU: What are you doing? From now, the milk price is 1.25 rupee per litre. Why have you brought down your price? Sell it for that or take your milk back. The milk will go bad, won't it? The society people give 2 rupees, 2 paisa per litre! Then you go and sell to them. When that set-up closes, don't come crying to us. First you offer us lower prices. Then you are rude to us. We won't sell the milk to these pimps from now on. We'll go to the Society people. Why put ideas into her head? I have to repay his debt. Forget him. Come on. Don't put on airs. You still have to pay for your buffalo. I spit on you. Sir, something's stuck in my throat. It's nothing. Is that Shanta-Bhabi's letter? What's happening? They're rushing in, sir. What, have you fallen ill too? Ill? Not at all. Why have they come? Sahib, from today we are not going to Mishra. We will sell the milk to you. Test it. For your sake we've added less water. It's true, sahib. Has Mishra refused the milk? Mishra pays less and less. And orders us to return the next day. What do you want to tell them? We said we need more people to form the society. Here they are. If we refuse they won't trust us. What will we do with the milk? We'll deliver it to the government dairy. Today we'll take the milk. But not from tomorrow. What will we do tomorrow, then? Set fire to the milk? See, he confuses matters straightaway. Look, we are not here to trade in milk. That is the job of the coop which is yet to be formed. You did not say that. You said you would give us a better price. Yes or no? Once an idea enters your head, can it ever be removed? Get on with that test. Don't rush all at the same time! Hey, what's going on? Let it go! Don't you dare touch my buffalo! Think it belongs to your father? You don't repay your debts and you hurl insults? I said I'll settle it by next month. Understand, you loony? I'll complain to the Society. Let them pay and collect the buffallo. What's the matter here? He's taking my buffalo in revenge for my joining the Society. How will the poor woman manage? The buffalo is her only means by which to repay your loan. Listen, sahib, don't interfere. Then I'll go to Mishra. Sir, no new members since that first lot. How long can we carry on? [EN] Your guess is as good as mine. Unless Bhola and headman pitch in, we are stuck right here. Then it's better to forget this cooperative altogether. The headman souldn't pose a problem. He is a trader after all. I'll work on him tomorrow. Once the headman is with us the village will follow. It's more important for Bhola and his caste to join. At the milk centres, all caste and creed will be erased. People of all castes will stand together in one queue to hand in their collection of milk. Accounts will be kept by the Society members. The milk centres will also sell cattlefeed and fertilisers. The earnings will go towards welfare and medication of animals. Nineteen mobile veterinary units at Anand, four nearby villages, on duty 24 hours for emergencies. Arrange artificial insemination of animals in every village. At places this experiment has progressed rapidly. At others, it is only a matter of time for it to catch on. The first Societies were formed in Gujarat's Kheda district. They merged to form a Federation based at Anand. The Society has its own vans, and a dairy plant to store milk and produce dairy products. Milk is collected and taken to the dairy at the Centre. It is tested for fat content and samples are graded. The price is fixed accordingly. Each Society settles it's accounts at the end of the month. Milk pours into various sections of the plant. The co-ops helped increase Kheda's industrial potential The question is: can their success at Anand be repeated elsewhere? [ People screaming ] If the experiment works well milk production will increase. [ People screaming ] HEADMAN: Well done. It's almost a miracle. Frakly, I thought you'd be unable to handle this work. But you've done it. The Cooperative will flourish only when you join in. Please, become a member soon. Welcome to our cooperative. I was telling my friends just that this morning. We should work together for the good of the village. Now we need only the Dalit community. What have they to do with the Society? They blindly follow Bhola and he is a trouble-maker? I suspect he threw the stone at our film screening last night. Leave him to me. Bindu, wait! Where are you going? Where has that buffalo bolted to? I wanted to ask you something. What's wrong with your buffalo? Nothing. He's pickly as a burr, that's all. How have we upset him that he is so against us? You have done nothing but there's that city guy. Who? His father. See that road? His father was the contractor for it. Bhola's mother used to clean his house. He made her pregnant and left. That's why Bhola is the way he is. I see. Why don't you persuade him to join the Society? He's a tough one, sahib, he listens to no one. The Society will benefit a lot if he joins. Ask him and see. If you tell me to, I will. How does he get along with the headman? Not a bit. Why? Bhola was getting some land, right there. What happened? The headman interfered. Why? Bhola is my caste, a Dalit. Do you have children? No. Why? Aren't you married yet? I am. Is your wife beautiful? Where is that buffalo! Does she always behave like this? She'll come, sahib. You can go. Semen for artificial insemination is obtained from young bulls. It is sealed in glass tubes and kept on ice till it is used. When the buffalo is on heat the doctor inserts it into its anus and deposits the semen from the tube. It is no use inseminating an animal when it is not on heat. The semen is of a pedigree bull for producing more milk. I don't see any Dalits here. You don't know? Bhola is in jail. What for? They believe we caused his arrest. He is a real hooligan, that one. That bastard threw the stone at your film screening. I had him put in the lock-up. Do you have proof? Your man complained about it. Which one? Deshmukh, sahib. I was angry when he played this mischief on you. You are our guests. He'll serve six months. I wrote his report. This is not good at all. Did you complain to the headman about Bhola? No. The headman says you did. I did mention that Bhola may have thrown that stone. Do you know he is now in jail? Now no Dalit will join us. [ Motor stops ] [ Motor does not start ] [ Motor does not start ] [ Motor starts ] DESHMUKH: Where did you go? To the city. DESHMUKH: Some tea? There is a letter for you. Where is it? Was there any gent work? I had Bhola released from jail. Shanta is coming here. I will have to look for another house. You like this awful place so much that now you don't want to leave? Try to understand the people who live here. They have some good qualities too. You like them because they feel you are an important man. [EN] Nonsense. They respect you. If I could help it, I would leave now. I didn't force you to come here. It's you who sent for me. Yes, I did. Because your letters were full of complaints that you were lonely and unhappy. Does Shanta-Bhabhi like living in the village? She is adjusting to it. But it will take time. [EN] I'm not happy about how things are going. Only the well-to-do like the headman have joined the Society. We must get Bhola and his lot also. The problem is when Bhola joins the headman may quit. Why meddle in local politics? But what use is a Cooperative without the have-nots? Okay, but what's the hurry? They will join once they see the good in it. From the start, if only the rich become members the Dalits will decide that the Society is not for them. They may even be debarred from it. You've made the Dalits the main issue. When forming the Cooperative itself is the main issue. [EN] You are wrong! Our primary objective is that the poorest farmers should benefit. In this village the Dalits are the poorest community. If your concern is only the Dalits, why do you ask my opinion? Ma [ Some dogs howl outside ] [ Car honk ] Bhola, why aren't you joining the Society? Without you, your entire caste will keep away. Your Society is only for big people. But it is the poor who should benefit from the Cooperative. Don't you want a better life for your own people? Do you want to improve our lives, sahib? What do you know of our lives? That swine, Deshmukh complained and I was put in the lock-up. We are the lowest of the low. Who cares for us? Our forefathers were your slaves. They cringed before you. You spat on them. And got free work out of them. [ A young girl screams ] And you use our women as well. Do you know what your man has done? I'll show you. Go inside and see! [ A young girl crying ] What's happening here? Your man is carrying on with her. -One of us? Who? -That guy with the red shirt. She's hot for him. He said he'll marry her and take her to the city. They'll settle down there. You city guys are one of a kind. Grab all you can, then run away. I know, sahib. My mother also met such a one. Get up. Pack your bags and come with me. Get ready. You are out. You are no longer required here, understand? What have I done, sir? You know bloody well what you've done. I just come from that girl's house. Do you know how badly her father has beaten her? -Sir, I… -Shut up! Pack up and leave. -Now? -Right now! -Don't be so harsh… -Don't interfere. You look worried. I have sent Chandavarkar away. Why? You won't understand. He was having an affair with a Dalit girl. Why be so disgusted? Chandavarkar? Stooping so low? I said you would not understand. Sahib, today's earnings. Even lower than yesterday? The milk must be adulterated. Those rascals add water to it. Sir, the Cooperative is to blame. Our effort till now has come to nothing. You people don't know the fundamentals of good business. Why blame others for your own shortcomings? We have to bear what destiny has prepared for us. It is useless to desire something that is not for you, understand? Give me the sales for the Cooperative if you have them. Haven't you heard? Show me the figures of the Cooperative! They are there below. Speak up and say so! Am I to see it in a dream? Have both Bhola and the headman joined the Society? Yes, sir. Our competitors are an inspired lot. From today we too will put our heart and soul into our work. From tomorrow, we will pay more for the milk we are buying. How can we afford that? Our business will topple. Idiot. Which is mightier, your brain or a buffalo? Those who are willing to lose a little win a lot. God helps those who show patience and endurance. Hard work and patience is the way to ultimate peace. Tie this thought in a knot and remember it. Brothers and sisters, sell your milk to the Ganganath Dairy. Ganganath Dairy has increased its buying price. Ganganath Dairy has started a lottery for you. Try your luck! Sell milk to Ganganath Dairy and win a thousand rupees. ♪ In clothes ♪ white looks best ♪ ♪ And in women ♪ the fair ones are best ♪ As soon as we joined the coop that Mishra raised his price. Now we are at disadvantage. These are ruses to break the Society. Later he will lower his price. Is that the only aim of a coop, to establish a fair price? It can help you in many ways. One coop built a road from the village to the highway. Others have dug tube wells, started schools… Schools. So can you. Will Mishra do all this for you? Sahib, I understand. Proper care for your buffalo, right cattle-feed, right breed… The Society will help in all matters. In all matters? Of course. Want to get married? We'll arrange that too. Wait, brothers. Sell milk to the Ganganath Dairy. You'll get a better price. The coop has no stake at this village. It may close down any day. You Mishra stooge! I'll break your head. Go get milk some place else. Don't come to our society. Bhola, who is the man? He's Mishra's guy. Yesterday also the milk on the Mengni route turned sour. [EN] You should be more careful. The truck leaves on time.

Mulla, drive the jeep. Our nation's strength is increasing… Before the headman acts, I must meet the doctor. Dr Rao, he wants to talk to you. How is it getting along? Happy with the cooperative? Sir, we want to talk about the election. The headman wants to make the coop his own property, run it himself and swallow its profits. Will you allow that? I am not responsible for what's happening. Sahib, you know what's going on. __ __ __ __ All right. __ You must choose your candidate. Then you know your strength. Strength? If we have a candidate, the headman will take revenge. That's your business. If you are scared of the higher castes, why do you grumble? Sir, the headman is powerful. Stick together and you will be a match for him. Sir, let the headman be chairman. No! We will fight in the elections. Let the headman do what he likes. Sir, you tell us who should be our man. Sahib, you explain to Bhola. The headman can't attack you. You are outsiders but he'll finish us. Moti, you people asked for our advice and we gave it. Now do what you think best. We'll fight our own battles. We are not eunuchs. It is not fair to favour one party in this manner. It will only cause greater tensioin between Bhola and the headman. I see no harm. We must treat both sides equally. One has money and power, the other nothing. Treat both equally? What do you mean? Bindu will not meet you anymore. Go! Is she out? I have some work concerning the Society. I am back. Now Bindu will not work for any Society. Are you her husband? Who else? Do I look like her father? Get out! If you follow my wife around I'll beat your brains out! Educated man, and yet you chase our women? Bastard! Street dog! She's no better! Look at her once more and I'll smash your Society to bits! Shanta, are you asleep? Why do you mix so much with Dalits? They are beneath us, it's degrading. Who told you all this? These walls. Who else am I to talk to in this desert? You see, you don't understand my responsibilities or my helplessness. Yes, I don't understand anything. I am just a useless peasant, worse than these Dalits you love. What do you expect? Am I to rot here till I go mad? Don't touch me! I hate you. Bitch, do you think I don't know why you won't let me touch you? Hot for your lover? He comes sniffing and you're ready, you slut! Stay there! I swear by my son. Touch me again and I'll jump into the well. Go, jump. I'll throw in two handfuls of mud to help bury you. You run! You go to the doctor and blacken my face? Wait and see what I do to you. You won't escape. When you marry, you dream you will be a queen in your home. But who knows the future? RAO: Members have understood the advantages of the coop. Everything depends on Bhola and the headman. It will all be ruined if the elections turn communal. We shouldn't interfere in local politics. The issues will resolve in their own time. Come inside! Bindu is here. Bindu? How are you? Her buffalo is dead. She wants a loan from the Society to buy another. We'll see at the meeting tomorrow. Mark my words, doctor. The headman won't allow it. Then it must wait till the elctions are over. Till then, what will she do? Starve? Bindu, take this. What's come over her? Bhola, you give it to her. Take it. Did I go with you to beg? Then why do you ask me to take you? If I explained my situation he'd know and share my sorrow. But he's like everyone else. Take it. You'll need it. [ Chattering ] Shall we start? Quiet! There is only one nominee for chairman, the headman. If no oher name is submitted, he will be elected. Our man will also stand. Take down Moti's name. No. I won't go against him. What do you lose? BHOLA: There's nothing to worry about. We will do as Bhola says. All Dalits must vote for their man. Your vote should be guided by his honesty, not his caste. If the Dalits vote for their man we will force the village to back the headman. Whoever defies the headman better watch out. What are you people doing? Your caste differences will only get worse! These high-caste people will not support us, you'll see. They'll hoodwink the Society and run. I won't hear this kind of talk! The Society has not caste or creed. The Society is meant to benefit any farmer of any caste. Isn't that so? Your yardstick is the same for humans and these animals? Animals? You call us "animals"?

For the last 20 years I have been serving you people. My efforts were rewarded, as you know. Two years ago our village Court won the District prize. [ Applause ] Also the Society was established here on my say-so. As headman I have snouldered the burden of this village. Every individual must be aware of his position and abilities. All should know their place. Only this can ensure discipline. Then we can live together happily and peacefully. [ Applause ] Now, vote for your headman as chaiirman. By voting for him, what will you gain? Suppose Moti is chairman. Will he help only his own caste? Get it into your thick skulls that we poor people together can run the Society for the benefit of all. Your well-being is our well-being. Moti, our Moti, is a poor man like the rest of us. He will think of everyone's good. Vote for him. The headman will swallow up your Society. Am I lying? Last year, the village bought seeds which he used on his fields. For the school, his brother-in-law got the contract. Think. Will such a man help you and me? No way. This monkeying with us is just to impress the District Board. What other aim would he have? Think before you vote. RAO: I hear your men clashed with some Dalits yesterday. Really? I haven't heard amy such thing. It doesn't matter whether you heard it or not. All this infighting will harm the society. In that case better tick off that Bhola. Bhola, this bickering must stop or the Society will break. Don't I know that? All this trouble has been hatched by that swine, the headman. Let him do as he pleases. Are you not responsible too? ♩ I languiish ♩ waiting to see you ♩ ♩ I cannot endure the day or night ♩ To whom shall my heart cry out? ♩ ♩ I am so weary ♩ ♩ I no longer go ♩ to milk the cow ♩ ♩ I no longer go ♩ the well for water ♩ ♩ I know neither peace ♩ nor rest ♩ ♩ Don't forget to come to my house ♩ The headman and Moti have an equal number of votes. According to our rules, we will write both names and pick out one. Mulla, bring the papers. Atul, bring a child here. Son, pick one slip of paper. The new chairman of the coop of the village is Moti. [ Cheering ] Doctor, this cannot be. This simply cannot be permitted. I have never lost an election in my whole life. You have ruined my reputation. You don't know me, doctor. Many leaders come here to canvas for my elections. And for this bogus Society you have cut my nose. But in a village, it's the village Council that's supreme. Now, your Society cannot take that over. Arrange the draw again and this time I must win. That's against the law. The law? What law! To hell with it! Just announce once that I have won. Then I will voluntarily resign. I can't do it. You should have warned me of such malpractices. I wouldn't have contested then. You have ruined the name of my village. Your hanky-panky won't work here anymore. Who is it? Bildu? Come, Bildu, dear. Sit down. Sit on the chair. I heard that you've been in a bad way lately. Your husband left you, your buffalo died… Why didn't you tell us? You know how concerned I am about you people. It is my duty to help you. When will I get the buffalo? There's no delay on my part. Take it from the stable right now. I've the receipt ready. Your thumbprint and the cow is yours. At what rate of interest? What kind of talk is this? What kind of rascals want to charge interest? Place your thumb here. But remember, dear, you must not retract what is stated on this paper. What's written there? You silly, there's nothing in to harm you. Have anyone read it to you if you like. She'll agree, Mr Mishra. Don't worry. Your thumb, dear. Here you are, Mr lawyer. I hope she won't change her mind later. Sir, leave that to me. If he reaches Mengni village an hour earlier. -We can't do that. -Why not? [EN] We'd have to employ __ on deliveries. May I speak to you in private for a minute? Excuse me. The cost of an extra deliver is high, our income won't cover it. Doctor Rao, here it is. Take your time and read it. No hurry. My client has accused you of rape. What? Rubbish! She is from the village. Her name is Bindu. Read it yourself. All this is a lie! I wouldn't know. But you will be prosecuted. Everyone will hear of it. Then why throw mud on me here? Why not at court? Don't discharge your anger on me, it's not me who's sueing you. I am merely the lawyer. I respect you. Please, go away. I presented this in case you want to start counter proceedings. What's the matter? Why did he come? It's nothing important. So we will employ another driver and from Mengni we will take the road… I'm going home. ♩ I languiish ♩ waiting to see you ♩ ♩ I cannot endure the day or night ♩ To whom shall my heart cry out? ♩ ♩ I am so weary ♩ ♩ I am so weary ♩ Come, sir. Is everything all right? [ People screaming ] Doctor Rao! [ Banging at the door ] Come, quickly, doctor Rao. The entire Dalit village has been set on fire. -Who did it? -The headman's people. Shanta, go to sleep now. Please, Shanta. Anasuya, sit near Shanta. You took time to come. What's the news? Not good. Everyone except the Dalits have been released on bail. You are right. But these people must be in jail for a few days. Otherwise the tension will mount. The tension is due only to them? I've given my opinion. If you insist, why don't you meet the Judicial Magistrate? How do you know the Dalits are at fault? Any trouble and they are to blame. Here, take this, sister. A great pity. Is the inspector there? Please, call him. Sir, I have a request. Those Dalits in jail, I am willing to offer bail for them. Come down. Go and sit inside. Why have we been brought here? Mr Mishra wants to welcome us. The swine. He thinks he can buy us because he bailed us out! Try and understand how seious the situation is. Sit down, all of you. Don't feel shy. Moti, get up. Why are you sitting here? Sit there, on the chair. Bhola, come here. Please, come. Never mind. Sit down. My dear brothers and sisters, you may have forgotten our old ties but I have not. A true friend always helps in time of need. [ Baby crying ] My heart is full seeing your misfortune and pain. Make it stop crying. My heart goes out to you in your pain. It is my duty to share your sorrow. Give the names of people whose huts were burnt down. We will do all we can to help them. All of you came under the influence of these city people. But never mind. Children do make mistakes. We elders must overlook your lapses. Now you will be able to gauge the genuine person from the false. They are as different as milk and water. Are we here to listen to his rubbish? He'll give money now to keep us in his grip! Bhola, what are you saying? Cool down. Be patient. Anger is bad for your health. I say this for your own good. You have my trust as we are friends over the years. All this won't work! I tell you. He will destroy the Society! What did the Society do for us? It's Mr Mishra who released us. What's wrong with taking loans? You'll have a loan from him again? Taking it you'll break down all we have built. The Society is ours. We have created it. We got rid of the headman. Now you want this bastard to fix you? It was partly our fault. We admit it. But we wanted to join hands to create something new. Won't this go into your heads? Brothers, so our Bhola has gone off his mind. He is mad. Come back soon. Otherwise there will be chaos. I'll be back with orders for Doctor's removal. He's getting to be too much. They have released you? They have released everyone. No need to worry. Do you know what's happening to the Society? So? What are you doing about it? What am I to do? The rest have abandoned it. Looks as if I am the only one now. All the others seem to have lost their senses. Work is always thwarted in the beginning. At such times, it's best to be low. You mean we sit with folded arms and do nothing? For a while. [EN] I don't think I agree with you. But who will listen to us? When you came here you talked big about doing things and creating something new. You have conceded failure so soon? But I won't let it happen. All of you can give up but I won't! Do what you like. Your personal quarrels have split the village in two. Now bear the consequences. Doctor sahib, think about it. I'll be back. -What is it? -I want to see Dr Rao. Come in. He should be here soon. I don't wish to talk to you. You musn't be angry with me. Please, hear me out. You'll benefit from it. I've said I don't want to talk to you. [EN] Please, go away. I have some important information. What is it? In private, please. You know this story has been concocted to blackmail me. That's why I got a third party to pressure Bindu to retract it. She has agreed to do so. Who is that party? Ganga Prasad Mishra, the proprietor of Ganganath Dairy. So this is all his doing. I should have known. Moreover, he will compensate you for your mental agony. [EN] Get out of here! [EN] The bastard! [EN] He thinks he can kick me around as he likes. [EN] I'll show him. Let's see what this fool of Mishra can do. He thinks he can get away with whatever he wants. [EN] I'll break that bloody swine if it's the last thing I do. This Cooperative will run. You wait and see. Sir, telegram for you. Good news for you, Shanta. Orders from Head Office. We are going back home. We are leaving this village today. I came to say goddbye. Bindu is not here. She has gone away. Hell of a big shot.
