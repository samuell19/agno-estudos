A Shochiku Production Beat Takeshi Kie Nakai Shingo Yanagisawa Taichiro Kawabe Naoko Otani Produced by: Takeshi Sasaki Script by: Takeshi Yoshida Cinematography by: Noritaka Sakamoto Music by: Taku Izumi Directed by: Masaharu Segawa - We have just entered May. - Yes. May reminds you of the past, there's even 'May Disease', and people stop going to school or something. They sometimes can't keep up with the new material in their classes. And before, something like Biology... - I took that, I hated it! - Right? - You hated it? I seemed to not like it. - Yes. - The illustrations? - Yeah, the illustrations. And unfortunately, I got this postcard. Alright, here's a biology problem, okay? What is an animal with no teeth in the mammal species? Everyone says stuff like anteaters, but the answer is an old lady. - What about an old man? - Old men are included as well. - Alright, shall we move on to the last topic? - Yes. - This is from Nakayama, in Yokama. - Alright, Nakayama. He knows an old man, but when all of the old man's friends are dying one after the other, he's the only one staying alive, and he's asking why. - I don't know. - Well. Here's the answer. With all of those funerals, and carrying the casket all of the time, his legs and back became strong. He became a strong guy. - This one, the ending is is a hit, isn't it? - Yeah. Nakayama, you're doing a great job! Should we give him something? - That's a good idea. - Maybe a sweatshirt. - Alright, let's give him that. - Give it for free. You did amazing. Funerals these days are hard without money. Right. Once you get picky about caskets too, there are even ones with sprinklers. Stop it! Once the temperature reaches a certain point, the sprinkler turns on automatically. That way the body won't feel too hot. That's great, isn't it? Alright, now it's time to say goodbye. - Okay! - Yoshi and... - ...Yuuko's... - ...Midnight Disk! Hiroshi and Yuuko, great job today, thank you. Great job. Do you think they're dating? - They do it so often. - That's just them being comfortable. He has a kid from his divorced wife, doesn't he? Joke With a Sorrowful Heart Great work! I told you we didn't need the car, 'cause we're going drinking. What are you going to do tomorrow morning? The PTA meeting at Ken's school. Why don't you go? You know the school better. No, tomorrow's the Parent-Kid chorus day! The parent needs to go! Mr. Hiroshi! You don't ever dance, do you? How could I dance while drunk? Then, why do you even go to a disco? Can you let me stay at your place? - You're always sleeping over. - Not in that way. You're serious? Nope! Stop it! Mr. Hiroshi! What great timing! Mr. Itou! - He's the next manager of the department. - Nice to meet you. It is also a summer thing, won't you pop in for me? - Fuji honey, hurry up and introduce me! - Hm? Oh yeah. She's the hostess of the "L'amour Club". Nice to meet you! I own a hostess club, come to mine sometime too, won't you? - That's a good idea, let's go! - I'm a big fan! Want to go? No. - Alright. - Okay, let's go. Okay, okay, okay, don't ring it so much in the middle of the night! Who is it? It's me. Okay, okay, I got it already. Don't ring it so much! - Ouch. - Ah, I'm sorry. You push it open, huh? Come on! I thoroughly spent time with them. Thoroughly. - Are you okay? - Thoroughly using me... - What are you saying? - I'm lonely, so. Ow, okay, just... Just let me sleep. Come on, this isn't helpful. I wasn't thinking that someone's coming over at this hour. People think that we have a relationship even when... - Where are you touching? -Ouch! People think we have a relationship even when we don't. - My head... - I don't like complicated relationships! My head and hand hurt, my hand hurts. Come on! Is that the trash? - Want me to? - It's fine. - The glass goes over there. - I know! That goes over there. You're gonna drink coffee, right? Uh-uh. Last night was long. They took me to two, three places so early in the morning. I'm exhausted. No one's listening. Dad, you can't wear my pajamas. This is yours, huh? No wonder it's so small. I'll wash it, okay? My, oh my. - This is really bitter. - Cutting back on sugar. Sweet things are bad for you. Talking like you're so important. Today's that, uh, PTA Parent-Kid chorus, right? - It's fine, you don't have to come. - I should go, right? You don't have to come. Here's Japanese... Social studies, social studies, social studies... Hey! You're buying stuff like this and reading it? You bought that the other day, Dad. Alright, I'm going, bye! Hey, Ken. What's the matter? Dizziness. It happens sometimes recently. It's because you're out late. I'm not like you, Dad. Clean up when you're done, okay? Just put it in the sink. I'll do the rest. Bye! Here you go. Wow, you're wearing a necktie? I have to straighten up for things like this. I know that. Oh, you have rehearsal from 1 o'clock, so please leave here by 12. You're dressed too flashy, stay back, don't follow so closely. Oh, it's starting to rain! Here, an umbrella. Why bring such a flashy umbrella? One fifth plus three fifths is...? Four fifths! If the denominators are the same, you add just the numerators. Today, we reviewed fractions. Next, let's finish up with the Parent-Kid chorus that we promised. Today, Mr. Hiroshi whom we know from TV is here. No, I mean, Igarashi's father is here, so let's try our best today! The conductor is Igarashi. Isn't it great that your dad is here? Alright, let's move the desks. Hurry, hurry! Would the mothers please move toward this side of the room? Thank you. You can't sing, right? That's why I said you didn't need to come. Zenpei was nagging me to come, that's why I came. What is this? You're going to conduct up there, right? Dad is going to sing, okay? Alright, then! Is everyone ready? Ah, sir, please, join us. - Please, join us. - Over here, Igarashi's father. Okay! One day, I... One day, I talked deeply with my dad. Green, oh...! About the joys of living in this world, and about the sadness. There, oh... sing, blue... Green, green, the birds sing in the blue sky. Green, green! Green, green, the green la la la stretches to the other side of the hill. At that moment, my father said, while holding me in his arms. Ah...! Don't cry even when la la la you're sad or dark. One morning... Green, green, a soft wind blows through the blue sky. - One day, I... - Green, green, the green increases la la la over the hill. One morning, I woke up and then found out. That in this world there are hard and sad times. What are you doing, just mouthing the words like a gorilla with artificial teeth! How can I sing a song like this? I'm going to get hives from a Parent-Kid chorus. - Wait, Mr. Hiroshi! - Watch Ken. The promise I made with my dad that day... I think... I had my fist up to one of my eyes, and stood my ground. Green, green, tears were on my eyelids... Hi. You were watching, huh? You fool! Hello. - Sleep deprivation and dizziness? - Yes. Ken? Maybe he's tired from the Parent-Kid chorus? I don't know what it is, but the nurse from school said a doctor should look at him. She's worried because he gets dizzy often. - Then take him to the doctor. - We went right away. We had a hospital introduced to us, and they examined his brain, and the doctor said he has to talk to the parents, and to come right away. - Really? - Yes! - Let's go, then. - Okay. Brain Stem Tumor. This is the cause of his dizziness. Is it dangerous? Well. Progressive Intracranial Pressure. Meaning, that the brain is under a lot of pressure. So what happens now? Sadly, that's it. Comparatively speaking, patients seem to suffer less and sleep more. Does that mean he's going to die? Doctor, don't be so calm, please do the surgery. Surgery of the brain stem is difficult. It's hard to insert a scalpel or a laser in there. If you damage the important part of the brain, it's instant death. Well, doctor, can't you do something? Please. I'll give you the films and a letter, so you'd better go look elsewhere. Production in Session Ah, boss! What is it? Is Hiroshi being unreasonable? I don't know, he just told me to call you, it seemed serious. Really? That's terrifying, well, how is he? He was very worked up. Okay! It's okay! Hiroshi! - Hey, hey! - It's done! - What are you doing? - What's the matter, Mr. Hiroshi? It's done, Mr. Hiroshi! Stop it, Hiroshi! - Wait, Mr. Hiroshi! - Mr. Hiroshi! Mr. Hiroshi, stop, stop. Everyone, help! Mr. Hiroshi! What are you doing? - Mr. Hiroshi! Mr. Hiroshi! Mr. Hiroshi! - Stop it! Stop it! - Stop! - Mr. Hiroshi! What are you doing? What did you want to talk about? What's going on, you punk?! Woah, are you okay? Find me a doctor, one of yours. Can you find me one that will actually help? Also, I need money. Give me 1,000,000 yen. And I can't be working all the time. Just work within the city, and nothing late into the night. - What does this mean, Mr. Hiroshi? - Hey, you listen. Calm down and explain! There's the advance... we got an advance for at least six month's worth. What do you mean doctor? A doctor for the head. A brain surgeon. A brain surgeon? Mr. Hiroshi, is this about Ken? Don't say it so loudly. - Apparently... - Yeah? Apparently, it's a brain tumor. - What? - You can die if you don't do anything. - And... - Yeah. The surgery is difficult. You're kidding, right? That can't be true. That doctor's joking around! We'll look thoroughly, alright? - I'm counting on you. - Yeah! Also, we can't tell Ken about this. So don't tell anyone, okay? - Okay. - Acting, okay? Do some acting. You're such a radish, so do it properly! - Hey, Rokusuke. - Huh? You couldn't act and became the manager, so try harder. What's up with you? It'll be alright! Ken will be fine! I know that you need help. I'll look everywhere! - That's right! - Yeah! There's gotta be a doctor that can do it, even if it's difficult. - There's gotta be one. - That's right! - Right? - Yeah! There is one! There will be one. Good luck! What does he need the luck for? Huh? Doctor, can't you stop glaring at that and research more? You have CT scans and so many more things, don't you? I'll pay. We can't apply radioactive waves too much, it's dangerous to stimulate the tumor. This picture is enough. This is really great. I mean, these aren't post cards so, what's the deal? It's just like this diagnosis says. If it goes on like this, in the near future... What do you mean in the near future? Well, there are many cases. I don't mean the normal case, I'm talking about my son. Is it dangerous in the next two or three days? No, not the next two or three days. Then, one month? Two months? What about three months? There is the possibility that the condition won't progress, but will maintain its current state. He needs to take the medication, and reduce salt intake and stress. I can't say that he'll get better, but we'll try to maintain his condition. Won't he get better? I need him to get better! Please, do the surgery. I can't do it. It's in a bad place. I can't see it working, I can't do it. Then, what should I do? Help him maintain a healthy life. And try to use the time left, to give him the best life possible. Doctor... My son is ten. Ten years old. How can I say to my ten year old son, that he needs to live his best life because he's going to die? That's common sense. You, as the parent, need to stay silent and endure it. Don't lose hope until the end. Give your boy a fulfilling life. I'll find a solution. Don't lose hope. - Hey, daddy. - Huh? Am I sick? Oh, your dizziness, when we examined it, they said that nothing's wrong. Right? Yeah! Don't worry, don't think about it. Don't stay up late, okay? It's bad for you. It's boring being at the house by myself. Dad said that he'll be home earlier from now on. And don't eat salty foods. And no oily foods either. If I'm alone, I eat too much when I cook food, and the flavor is too much when it's instant food. From now on, Dad will try to eat with you as much as possible. - Right? - Huh? Right? What's the matter? You're acting strangely, Zen. No, I'm not. - You'll find a doctor soon? - Yes! What is this? The boss and I are looking. If you don't hurry, it won't be in time! We'll be trying our best, so you do too! - Be like a dad. - Then, give me less work. I can't have family conversations. Great job. I heard your singing, it's great. You're a really great guy when you sing. - I'm always a great guy. - You're playing with me again. Oh, by the way, can you help me with shopping? I need to get something for Ken, but I don't understand children's things. - I don't know either. - You're still a kid here. You're touching again! Here, candy. You were holding it, that's disgusting. Ken! Ken! We bought some great stuff! Here. It's Guldo's LD! And Rample! Wow! This is amazing! - Here you go! - A Laser Disc? Wow! Why? Right? It's so surprising! Why? What do you mean? It's normal for parents to buy things for their kids. It's so sudden, though! That's weird. This kind of thing is..., you know? Why do you two keep talking to me? Why don't you talk directly to each other? You two are embarrassed! What a weird family. What are you saying? Oh, we need to eat! I'll make supper. What? Can you cook? I used to do it all the time before I sold well. How about we have a light tasting meal? Maybe some stewed vegetables and a meat tofu dish? And, uh, seaweed soup! That kind of stuff. We don't have vegetables. There isn't any tofu, seaweed, or vinegar either. Really? We'll get it if we go to the supermarket, the ones that are open until morning. Oh my, there really isn't anything. I have some curry made. Curry? Wow, it smells good. You made this, Ken? Yes! Let's eat this, come on, get some plates. - You like curry too, right? - Yes. Lots of salt here. - Oh, good morning! - Good morning. Good morning! Good morning! Huh? What are you doing? You'd know if you looked. So many eggs everywhere! I can make an omelet for you if you want! It's fine, I'm doing it! - It's okay, I'll do it, let go. - I said I'll do it. - I'll do it, okay? - What? - Ouch! You idiot! - Huh? - Are you alright? - You're noisy! What are you shouting about in the morning? Woah, this is awful. Isn't it bad? Right? Mr. Hiroshi, Ken and I will do the rest, so you can sit over there, okay? Please, we'll take care of it. Not too much salt, alright? And add a salad. And not coffee, but milk. Let's do a soft boiled egg if we need to avoid salt. Okay, how about the salad? Do we have any? - We don't have vegetables. - You have an orange! Alright, I'll do the toast and eggs, so can you do the plates, milk, and orange? Got it! I'll do it once I wash my face and change. Alrighty! - Hurry okay? Right away! - Yup! Ouch! - You dare to. - What is it? Don't be so friendly with Ken, you moron. Trying to stop the bond between parent and child? I'm sorry, I got carried away. Then, let's switch places. - Okay? - Okay. The toast will toast itself, so just cook the eggs for four minutes. We have milk... Ouch! Then, I have nothing to do. Ken! I'll step out, so do it with your dad, okay? What? With Dad? Interaction with your parents. A beautiful thing to get along, right? What's up with both of you? Everything's strange, yesterday and today. - Ouch! - What are you doing, you idiot? You radish! Incompatible! Incompatible... 'A beautiful thing to get along'? You are not acting for an add! Everyone will suspect! But you're being suspicious too! - How come I'm being suspicious? - You are. - What do you mean? - Why are you arguing? - Did you do the toast correctly? - It should be done any minute. - Ah! Ouch! - Oh no! Hiroshi! Cut! Sorry, can you do it one more time? - One more cut. - It's the seventh time. - Film change. - I'm sorry. - Alright! - You're doing great. Rest for a minute, okay? It's so cute! It looks great on you! - Can I get a signature? - Me too! Alright, no, no, step aside. - Move back! - Okay, okay. - Okay, later, alright? - Let's go. We found a doctor who will do the surgery. Oh, Mr. Igarashi? Hello, thank you for earlier. This is Doctor Hayaguchi, he's the one that's going to do the surgery for you. Let's do it, if it's for you, Mr. Hiroshi Igarashi. My son is a fan of yours. Um, I heard that the surgery is in a difficult spot. Yes, I've looked at the diagnosis and film. Let's try it. I've prepared for the surgery. I took the X-Ray, just in case. This is the only place that said they'll do it. They said it needed to be done right away, so they've made the preparations already. - This is great, isn't it? - You can come over here! Yes. - Over here, please. - Please. Please, officially stamp your name here. You could use your thumb too. It's a written consent for me to handle things. It might look intimidating. But it's just paperwork. I don't want any problems later on. - Do you mean that you're going to fail? - Well. Surgeries aren't full-proof. In Ken's case, if you fail he dies, right? I'm saying, that I'll focus on trying instead of succeeding. What's the percentage of success? Well, this is a very difficult surgery, so the percentage, it's more of a gamble. A gamble? That's irresponsible, calling it a gamble. Irresponsible? Mind your language! Trust in each day's possibilities and do the surgery. What part of this motto is irresponsible? Every other hospital let you down. Your kid is a patient that is 100% going to die. - Oh! - Hey, Hiroshi. Let's go home. - It's not over yet. - We don't need to do this crap. But the doctor... That isn't a doctor. You are not sick. How about we eat something good, huh? Something's strange. - What is? - Going to so many doctors. Well, that's because I'm worried about your dizziness. But it's nothing. Today's doctor was disrespectful, so we got in a fight. You weirdly want to stay at home, and you're strangely clinging to me recently. I mean, as a father, I want to sometimes do fatherly things. This is a great chance, is there something that you want? Or something you want me to do? Huh? Well then, can you let me be alone tonight? It feels so crowded, I'm used to being alone. My shoulders start to hurt. Why don't you go out tonight? Bye! I'm sorry, Mr. Hiroshi, for being late. I couldn't find a parking spot. Oh! The boss is waiting at the sushi place over there. Huh? Where's Ken? He said to let him have some alone time. Huh? He says it's too crowded with us. What should I do? Huh? What can I do? I can't help his disease, and I can't be kind to him even if I want to. What can I do? But boss, why do you think Hiroshi Igarashi is suddenly so serious? He stopped going out, and decreased his amount of work. Maybe he's trying to get into an art academy? What are you saying, teacher? Art academies, are things you try to get into when you have no appetite and no sexual appeal. His name sounds great, 'Awfully Bland'. Wow, you're really mean! Hey Kaoru! This is no laughing matter, listen, becoming serious when you're young, just leads you to failure in your job or sickness. Huh? Although that shouldn't happen. We want him to do great, don't we? Oh hey! Long time no see! - That hurts. - Did you hear? - You laughed. - Gahyon! - It's fine. - I don't have that many jokes. He doesn't understand people. Gahyon! What an idiot, yelling, "Gahyon!" It's been a while, hasn't it? Since we last drunk. - Can I get a beer? - Yes. How's being a father? It's apparent that a guy can't support a kid alone. Do families normally have a housewife or a mother? Should I be the mother, the housewife, for you? Don't joke, we're not playing house. - If you came, it'd be like having an extra kid. - Here you are. What is it? Ken! What are you doing out here? Is something happening? I'm just killing time before cram school starts. - You go to cram school? - I've been going since fourth grade! Really? Were you that stupid that you needed to go there? I'm just tagging along, everyone goes to cram school. I don't want to be left out. Are they not including you in baseball? I'm not good at it. - Go, Yousuke! - You can do it, Yousuke! What are you doing, third? - Thanks, mister! - Sorry about that! Let me in, come on. Ken! - Thanks! - Hey, I want to be the pinch hitter. - What? You're going to be the pinch hitter? - It's fine! Here. Wait a minute. You're Hiroshi Igarashi! - Hiroshi! - Hiroshi! - Hiroshi! - Hiroshi! Hey, guys, go to your positions, positions. Get off, it's not time to be climbing on me. - Wait! - Wait for it! I've been to the nationals before. Are you ready? Alright. - Let's go! Wait, -Go, go, Mr. Hiroshi! - Let's do this. - The bat's the opposite way. You mean like this? I can't hit it like this, you idiot. - What's wrong with it? - No, no, like this! Okay. The nationals were a long time ago. Let's go! Here we go! - Get a home run! - That's a foul! Here we go! - Do your best! - Do your best! - What's the matter? - My back... I just hurt it, ouch. In a pinch, I become the pinch hitter. Hey, that's not fair. It's not unfair, it's fine! Hey, hey, Ken! No! Igarashi can't play, he's bad at it. You idiot, this is his dad. It's fine, whatever, go play defense. Go on, hurry up! I'll be the umpire. Alright, nice. - Throw a good one! - Go, go, Ken! Foul ball! Throw a good one! - Ouch, ouch! Foul ball! - What? It's true! What have you been doing? I was letting Ken play baseball. - What are you doing? - Yuuko is here. She says that she's going to be the housewife. Huh? Ah, welcome home. I can't tell where things are at all! Once you're done, you need to clean the bathroom. I should go shopping first. Dad, give me some money. Dad? This isn't playing house. Oh? I'm being serious. About playing the good family's good wife, good mom, and good housewife. I'll be completely serious. Ah, you can treat my stay here as board and lodgings. Here! Don't touch the stuff on the table, I'm going to take care of that later! - Bye! - Mr. Hiroshi. What are you going to do? She'll get tired of it in three days, there's no way a woman like her can do chores. It's suffocating with just Ken and me, so it'll be a good distraction. I wonder if Ken will be okay. - She comes over often, so no need to worry. - I'm talking about his sickness. - If Yuuko finds out... - It's fine. She'll go home soon. This here, you'd better clean it. Yes. Here you go. Thank you. - You have everything? - Yup! - Bye! - See you later! Something wrong? It's nothing. - Are you alright? - Yes. Hey! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Bye! - See you! Oh dear, I haven't made breakfast yet. You get up early. I wasn't sleeping. I was reading. You haven't been getting much sleep recently, have you? I'm acting out because I'm not working or playing. I get depressed just standing. You're so serious this month. You even played baseball with Ken's friends. Ken says that his friends are asking for signatures, or wanting to be on TV. Last night he was laughing that he's pretty popular recently. He's always at home, and his personality's dark, so it makes me want to help him. Ken knows that. He was curious, though. No sugar! I wonder why. He said, "I wonder why he's acting like a dad recently." I wonder too. It's weird. You don't have as much work, and don't play around. Did something happen? You're acting weird too, suddenly wanting to be a housewife. Are you okay with that? It's going to be a month. I just wanted to, in the spur of the moment. Well, actually, I don't have any talents. Singing, or acting, or talking. I can do it a little bit. But none of them really click. I feel like a fake. But if I do things inside the house, I calm down. Won't you like me as a housewife? Did I fail the entrance exam? That's good. You have the skills for a housewife. Just the skills? I'm grateful, really. Ah, it fell off. - Good morning! - Oh! Oh, you're already awake? You're here early too. Isn't it your day off? The boss wants to eat lunch with us today. That's unusual. Do you want to eat lunch with us too, Yuuko? More importantly, you don't have much money in your bank account. What's going on with that, Zenpei? I bought a dryer, the payment is due at the end of this month. Maybe that's what the lunch is about, to talk about money. Here we go, Ken! I'll make the mark for where you should look. - Mr. Hiroshi too! Look here! Ready, cheese! - Ready? Cheese! Nice faces! Okay! It's almost summer break, isn't it, Ken? The pool here is great! It's cheap. Take him here sometime. - We're going overseas in the summer. - Really? Amazing! Hey, I have to talk to you. Ken, let's go take some pictures in the yard! - Yes! - Right? Ken, let's go. Oh dear, you spilled so much on your shirt, here. Huh? She's acting great as a mom. It's already been a month, isn't it? I don't know what to do. Why don't you let her help, asking more time? I can't do something so selfish. I mean, if you turn her play into reality, that's all solved. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. I'll find a good time to ask her to stop. I need money. My bank account is empty. That's what I needed to talk to you about. I don't have money either. I'm not joking about going overseas, you know? If I can't find a good doctor here, I'm going overseas. I need money, give me some. I already got an advance for all that I could. I don't have any more to give. You had to cut off your job with a lousy reason. So, we can't get more of an advance. Our family is holding up because of you, and we're friends. I'd like to help you in some way, but I have to save the rest for other celebrities. I'm sorry. I understand. I'll do something about the house and car. Wait, don't go yet, I'm not done talking with you. Just sit down, okay? There are actually two things that would help with money. The first is, selling the rights to the stage. Yoshinawa Company wants to buy it for a year. That's selling ourselves, our act will be messed up. Another is, Touyou Television. You can be the announcer for a 2-hour program. This is the contract for it, read it. What is this, "Gather All the Little Ones"? It's a show for brats. "Let's All Sing Songs of the World"? Well... You want me to be the nice singing guy? This thing isn't something to make fun of. You know that big manufacture company for kids' stuff called, Wonderland? It's that! The head there is a fan of yours! He has three programs during the Golden Hours. That's right! So what? This will help us with our advance. If this goes well, they want to use you as their company mascot. That's a contract of at least 10,000,000 yen. That program is basically the national platform for the country's parent-kid choruses. They said Ken's group could go too. You could save it in video, Ken's conducting. One, two, three, four, five! One, two, three, four, five! Yeah! Hello, everyone! I'm enjoying this very much today, but I don't know why I'm dressed like this. In this world, you would do anything for money, but today, "Let's All Sing Songs of the World"! So that's what we're... Oh dear, I'm pulling jokes as if it's on purpose. But what are we doing today? Ms. Imai? - Yes. - Yes. Hello! Today, kids from all around the country are singing with their mothers! They're singing, huh? - Yes. - Alright, I'll stop. Alright, well I'll introduce the first group. Representing Hokkaido, this is the parent-kid chorus of Fukazawa Elementary School! What is the song? The song is, "Oh, Blue Day". Let's hear it! Alright everyone, please be quiet! Thank you for waiting so long. Would the Kagoshima group please head this way? Alright everyone, this way! Everyone in the Kagoshima group, this way! This way! - I'm sorry, could I borrow your brush? - Go ahead. Ah! It's finally started. Are you ready? They said it is about time! - They're running so late. - The sun's going to set. You should get dinner ready. - What? - What? Tell them to hurry up. Alright, I'll go tell them. Want me to go buy a Coke or something? I don't want to drink it. Great job! You all did amazing, good work. - How much did you practice? - One week. One week? It's possible to sing this well in one week? You surprise me! Well, you all did great. You can go rest down there. Thank you very much! - Next is... - Yes? The representative of the south, Kagoshima in Kyushu. Nishiyama Elementary School will be presenting us with an amazing chorus. - Cut! Cut! - Cut? We need to change costumes. - Change costumes? It's fine, I can wear this. - No, it's not okay. Mr. Hiroshi, you'll get the skunk. Kaoru, you'll get the tiger. Please, hurry. A skunk and a tiger? Let's go home! Why do I need to dress like this? It's a misconception to think that kids will like it if you dress like this. No sense of style, at all. - Hey! It's a success! - I'm so thirsty. I'll get it for you! - Hey, hey, hey! Be careful. - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, are you okay? - You idiot. - Hiroshi. The theme for the new program is decided! And so is the commercial! The head is here, watching. He's in a good mood. He likes you! - Tea, tea, tea, tea. - Here's the tea. - I can't drink it like this. - I'm sorry, here. Hey. Is it not time for Ken's group yet? It's already three. They're the one after the next, after the next. He's so tired after waiting so long. Well, uh, let's have them switch up the order, and have them go first. Go talk to the producer. - Huh? - I got it! Then, when that's done, I'll bring the head over. See you! - So, the next group, right? - Yup! That kid was dizzy about a week ago too, before going to school. Maybe I should have him rest at home. You can't do that. What is a chorus going to do without a conductor? The next is, the representative from Tokyo. Here is the parent-kid chorus from West Adabo Elementary School's grade 5, class 2. The conductor is the son of the announcer Hiroshi, Ken. Mr. Hiroshi will be participating in the chorus as well. Welcome! Are you okay? You can conduct? Okay. I'm sorry. One day, I talked deeply with my dad. About the joys of living in this world, and about the sadness. Ah, he's mouthing the words again. He's such a lame dad. I wonder if he's okay, trying so hard. Huh? Well, remember how Ken didn't look so well earlier? At that moment, my father said, while holding me in his arms. Don't cry even when la la la you're sad or dark. Green, green, a soft wind blows through the blue sky. This is a song about a father and son, isn't it? It is indeed. One day, I woke up and then found out. That in this world, there are hard and sad times. Green, green, clouds run along the blue sky. Green, green, the green la la la touches the sky over the hill. Thank you so much. Until here is fine, thank you! I'm fine. Here. Yuuko is calling a taxi right now, so let's go to the hospital. You know the doctor, from Hair something clinic? That's the most trustworthy place. I've already told Yuuko. I'm fine, I was just a little dizzy. Just in case, alright? Mr. Hiroshi! We can't have you running off like that so suddenly. My kid's sick. Go back, dad. It's your job, right? - Please... - The Taxi's here! Come on, Ken. It's written on here, Yuuko, we'll leave it to you. Alright, got it. I'll take him, then. Thank you! Mr. Hiroshi, you need to change quickly. Yuuko will take care of the rest. Please, we need you to hurry, there's a time where the kids need to go back. - We have no time to waste. - I got it. You're so annoying. Hey, you're an employee here, right? Huh? We're the representatives from Kagoshima, but why was our time moved? - I'm sorry, there were some circumstances... - We know! The announcer's son was in the last group, right? Oh. You're here. To be honest, he wasn't feeling well. Oh? Our child has a cold, and they're doing it even then. That's all the same! - I'm sorry. - It's all messed up, really. We're gathered here since early morning, and lunch isn't even provided. Why are you whining? You idiot? There are some things in this world that can't be solved with bickering. Mr. Hiroshi! What are you talking about, "early in the morning"? You were happy to be here an hour or two early! If you have time to complain, go fix your face! - Mr. Hiroshi! - Look at your face! Your face is the one being impolite. - Let's go! - I'm sorry! If you want to go home, go to Kagoshima or wherever the heck you want! I'm not choosing to dress like this! - Mr. Hiroshi! - Not much money, and the funny items! Moron! Who would like this of job? We're really sorry! Hello. How do you do? Could you go see Ken? I'll do the rest alone. You're so stupid! Oh, sir, sir! He's fine! I mean, fine is weird, but, nothing big is going on, meaning, that his condition hasn't changed. It's just, Yuuko found out. I did use the CT scan just in case. It's hard to say that it's the same as last time. It's still the same. It's not getting better, but nothing is fatal either. Just little by little. Little by little, right? I'm very sorry. That can't be. Have the boy do what he likes. It is almost summer break, after all. It's Dad. Hey, they said you're fine. They said nothing's wrong, just dizziness. You can go home. Really? Isn't that great, Ken? Let's go home then, I don't like hospitals. Nobody likes hospitals, let's go home. Here we go! Good! I'm so hungry. - Should I make something? - I like that! There's a chicken basket, a little bit of salad, and I think an orange. - How about an omelet? - Yeah! You're going to eat too, right, Dad? Okay! - Should I make some toast? - Yes. - Oh, I found something. - Huh? Oh! I'll get it. - Yes? - It's me, it's me. It's the boss! I am in trouble! I've been with them until now! Everything's over. All that talk of commercials and being the announcer, all nothing! Oh, hey, Ken! It's great that nothing serious happened. -Hey. Hey. -Oh, are you going to eat dinner now? Ken, make sure not to burn the toast. Oh, where's the butter? You're unlucky. The head saw your worst side. I got irritated because Ken was dizzy. I understand, but that was bad. That mother just happened to be the head's favorite. If apologizing is going to fix things, I'll do that. There's just one way. Hold a press conference about Ken, reveal his disease and cry your eyes out! If you do that, everything will be solved, right? You'll have your job back just like before, and your popularity will increase. And then, sponsors will start looking for you! On top of that, there will be lots of people suggesting doctors, or offering to treat Ken. That may save Ken's life. Right? For Ken's sake! Go home. What do you mean, go home? If you leave it like this, you and Ken will be doomed! Go home, you idiot! Go home now! Wait a bit. Hey! Hey, I'm trying my best too! How can I do that while my kid is dying? - What other way is there? - Go home! You sure it's okay to say that to me? Your job and money will be doomed. Shut up! How are you going to get by? - You're going to need money! - Alright, alright! Hey, Hiroshi! - Hiroshi! - Don't come out! That music is annoying. It's because you're shouting. You can't let Ken hear. Zenpei put Ken in his room. Hey, can you step out for a moment? I must have looked stupid. I was all excited to play good house. I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you about his sickness. That's out of your control. I'm embarrassed of my own heart. I'm thankful. Did you think I was really going to come? No. You probably didn't think that it would last a month, did you? Not really. Do you understand how I feel? Answer honestly, okay? Or else, it'll just hurt me more. Did you use my feelings? That's not it. Absolutely not. It was hard for me, because I understood your feelings. Hey, can you answer another question? Are my feelings bothersome? I like you. But, our ages are so different, and you're serious while I'm not. - I feel that our worlds are so different. - Then, why did you refuse me? You refused me the other day, even when I expressed my feelings. Let's dance. Talking like this isn't something to do while sitting down, across from each other. Don't you feel bad for the girl? Can you at least take me seriously sometimes? Talk seriously. Please. My ex-wife said the same thing, when she was leaving. Like, when I'm on TV or on stage, when I'm enjoying things I'm serious about that, right? I mean, I can't unless I'm into it. What I'm saying is, you know how there's a way to do light things seriously? But when you go home, everything becomes serious. I just don't seem to know how to do serious things, seriously. So I get tired, and stop going home, and stay out late. And I play with women. And my ex-wife said that I'm a different person outside of the house than when I'm in. Just all depends. I didn't know what to do, and I told her, "Why don't you try having an affair too?" Then she got mad and left. It might be that Ken's head being messed up is a sign for me to repent. I can't do anything about it, it's going to stay the same. I think that maybe, I am the type of person, that shouldn't get married or have kids. A person can seriously do trivial things, but to seriously do important things? I don't know how to. It probably can't be fixed. One day, I talked deeply with my dad. About the joys of living in this world, and about the sadness. I guess it doesn't always work that way. Hey, can you at least have your wife come back for just this month? She's in Sydney right now. I think she has a boyfriend there, I can't ask her to come. I'll go home now, I'm too embarrassed to stay at your house. If something happens, call me, I'll come right away. Oh, right. This has about 1,000,000 yen in it, so use it. The pass code is 1234. It's fine, I have money. Don't lie, you only have your house and car. Save your money for emergency house fees and hospital fees. Use this for your summer vacation. It's my apology for my flippant manner. It's me that's flippant. No luck with the line of love, or with the line of fate. You're the same as me. You're lonesome, isn't it so? Why do you look so lonely? Huh? I guess drinking this late should be lonely. But everything is okay as long as I have this. The night keeps ongoing. Would you like a sip? Hey, drink. You can have it. Drink it. Night and friend. Hey, come to my house, and let's drink it together. Okay? Thatâ€™s you, right? Mr. Hiroshi Igarashi. I guess you have figured out what this is about. I don't have to explain further, then. I won't demand a high price. 5 million. Okay? Then you can have this. I have no money! Listen, I only have my house and car. You understand? I have no money at all. - That kind of trick doesn't... - Hey! I found it. Got it. That's not mine! My friend gave it to me for my kid. - Give it back. - What is the password? The password? No! That's not what you are looking for. That's my friend's. Hey, you can have the house. Our business is not that long-term. My car, then. I ride a Benz. A Benz, you say? Impressive! But foreign cars are cheaper when you actually sell them. But my friend gave that to me, for taking care of my sick kid going overseas for treatment. Okay. Sell the car, then. Call the dealer. I heard that it would be worth 4 million. What are you going to do with the 1 million? I will pay you later! No more waiting! Cash right away! But the kid is sick, so... The password? My friend gave it to me. The password! Say it now or I will break your bones! - It hurts! - Got it? One, two! - 1234! - Don't make it up. That's the password! 1234? You know, my life is not as easy as it looks. I have two kids. He has two parents as well. And I have spent a lot since you became my target. You know, this right here, is a charm from Iriyakishibojin Shrine. It treats kids' illnesses. Your kids got better, didnâ€™t they? This really works. Welcome home! They came to get your car earlier. What's going on? Yuuko disappears, and your car's taken away. You stink of alcohol. I can't believe you're having fun 'til morning when your child's sick. Shut up, it doesn't have to do with you. I quit being with Rokusuke! - It's not your business. Go home! - That won't do! I'm worried about Ken! And the boss said, that he can't leave a partner from way back alone, and is running all around... Oh yeah, Mr. Hiroshi! There's an available job! A quiz show for parents and kids. First place gets an international vacation! Thank you for your kindness. Are you mocking a poor comedian? Don't be so sarcastic. Ken wants to go on the show. Parent and Kid, Fun, Fun, World Travels! Alright, thank you. Everyone, we're doing it for real in 10 minutes! Celebrities will be roaming this place in 10 minutes, so remember to smile! You look a little dark, let's get lively! Let's clap one more time, ready? - Hello! - Hey! - Ben, it's Mr. Shiba! - Wow! - Oh, I look up to you! - Hey! Gahyon! Good luck, Mr. Igarashi. Oh, oh, oh! Hiroshi, it's been a while! Good thing you got invited! I didn't know what to do, my kid, she wants to get the bicycle for third place, Natsuko! - Your kid? - Ken. You look great! I bet you're popular. My kid's not good, she only gets good grades. Just don't lose to him. Gahyon! Gahyon! You're loud, moron. Mr. Hiroshi, have a moment? Good luck! Do you know where the vacation for first place is to? - I don't know. - Sydney. - Sydney? As in the one in Australia? - There isn't any other Sydney. Ken was excited that he'd get to see his mom. Why doesn't he say that to me? It's probably a little awkward for him to. Is a mother better than a bad father? It's not like that. He probably knows that you don't have much money. Good evening! Good evening! - Good evening! - Good evening! Welcome everyone! It is happening once again! Quiz Show, "Parent and Kid, Fun, Fun, World Travels"! I am Yoshio Koizumi, an emcee. How are you all? I am Hiroko Minami, an emcee. In this show, as you all know very well, the parent and their child will guess the rare, scenery, plant, or animal from around the world pictured on the screen. - That is how this show works. - Yes! Today is a special edition of this show, and we invited, five comedians who you're all familiar with, and their children to join us on this show. Let's introduce them! The first pair is the God of Laughter, Ben Muraki and his child! I'm Ben Muraki, famous for my gag, "Gahyon!" - This is my daughter, Natsuko, thank you. - Hello. - Good luck! - Thank you! First question. This place is 9 and a half hours from Tokyo, and we have crossed the equator. This is Australia's biggest city, Sydney. People from England who immigrated here were the first to inhabit this town, and you can see many old buildings around. However, there are also many modern buildings, being built, such as the Sydney Tower. Now, here is the question. Please answer with the name of this unusual building. Wow! We have Mr. Hiroshi answering right off the bat. What is the answer? The Diet Building. - Aw, that's too bad! - How unfortunate! Oh! The light has turned on! Mr. Muraki, what is the answer? Opera House! The answer is Opera House! Good job! She's good at geography. - Oh really? - That was amazing. We'll put one Koala here. Here you go. Okay, good luck to the other teams! Team Muraki, you are taking the lead by storm! Team Hiroshi, maybe the dad isn't feeling too well? You're in last place. Good luck! Alright, time for the next question. It'll be about an animal. Start the video! Time for the next question! Australia is also famous for being the home of many unusual animals, I'll answer first, so you stay quiet. It's okay, I'm great with animals. I had 5 in science during elementary school. We're not going to get a point. There are animals we're familiar with from books, such as koalas and kangaroos. There are also many other animals, such as wombats, who are, more popular than Koalas in Australia. Here is the question. What is the name, of this fierce animal with its teeth out? Here we go! The Muraki team beats everyone to it again! The answer? Tasmania devil! Correct! Alright, can we get another Koala, please? The Koalas just seem to pile up! My daughter knows a lot about animals! How knowledgeable! Alright, onto the next! Start the video! - How tedious! - Great job! Nice work! - That didn't work out, I see. - Yeah. - Where's Ken? - He's getting a participation award. I see. I hear it's a Koala badge. How disappointing, a participation award! What are you mumbling, idiot? Wow, what a day! I have to buy her a bicycle now. Natsuko says she doesn't want the Sydney trip. - Oh, Mr. Hiroshi, do you want it? - No, it's fine! You don't need it? Really? Okay. Maybe I should invite Seiko. Go get it! For Ken's sake, go get it! I'm not a beggar! You didn't help him, because you didn't want to go to Sydney! - What are you saying? - Then, go ask for it! Shut up, you knucklehead! Hey! If you really want to, then take him to Sydney or anywhere! Why doesn't he ask me? Huh? I'm his father. He should ask. Am I that untrustworthy? I bet so. That's why he wants to see his mom. Hey, call Rokusuke, and tell him that he can sell the rights. I'll do some construction work for a year. Are you sure? I heard that Yoshinawa Company makes their workers go around to cabarets if they don't sell. I am a performer. Why would I take something for free? I'll perform, and earn money. And then, I'll take Ken and make him happy. You got it, you bastard?! -Oh, Mr. Hiroshi! Can I have a signature later? -Yeah. Handshake, please. Thanks! That was too bad. Don't worry, okay? I'll take you with my own money. - Really? - Yes! Over there, there are lots of Koalas. You can't hug them in Japan. - Things will go well! - Yes! I'm taking the makeup off. Taxi, taxi. They probably can't hear. Here, let me see that. It's all in English! - What does it say? - Huh? Ah, let's see. "The gap between," "the temperatures during the day and night is big." It says that you'll either get a sunstroke during the day, or freeze to death at night. - My, my. - See here? It's true. "The drivers of the buses and taxis are kangaroos." That's a kangaroo over there. He's just disguised. When he gets off, he'll walk like this. Sydney City Hyde Park Blue Bird Hotel How about we rest for a bit? Eat, and then, go see the Koalas? Huh? Or do you want to save the Koalas, for tomorrow and go somewhere else instead? How about a luncheon cruise? How about this, where you eat on a touring boat while it goes around the Sydney Bay? I want to go on that! Sydney Opera House - There wasn't that much to see, right? - Yeah. I was too busy eating. - Shall we go? - Yes. Hey! Are you dizzy again? Hey! I guess not. I'm okay. Let's rest over there. Okay? Are you alright? Huh? You okay? You know, Mom's workplace, is somewhere around here. She's good at English, so she was called over from Japan. At this address here. Do you want to go see her? This one. May I help you? Um, um... Mie Akino. Oh, Miss Akino? She's out today. She went to church to prepare for her marriage. Marriage? Yes, tomorrow is her wedding. She's getting married? Mom? - Her address? - Oh, yeah, sure. Miss Mie! Yes? - Mom! - What? You're the same person, but how I call you is going to change tomorrow. That's right. I'll practice, okay? Mom. Yes? Alright, you call me next. - Kei. - Yes, Mom? - Kei. - Yes, Mom? Very good! Should we try it again? - Kei. - Yes, Mom? - Kei. - Yes, Mom? - Papa! - Come here! Welcome home. You made it in the nick of time. Yeah, we caught a lot of shrimp. - The pastor is waiting. - Huh? - Is rehearsal starting now? - Yes! Weddings aren't easy, are they? Would you stand next to her? Now, you put the rings. Let's go. We can't see her today. Let's call her later, and maybe see her at the hotel? What a mess. I should have apologized to her, huh? She was probably waiting too. You'll see, she'll come back. She always told me to wait by you. - You were seeing Mom? - Yeah. Two or three times a year. Always. I see. A year ago, she said she was going to Australia, and came to see me. She had given up. Saying, "Dad doesn't seem to need me anymore." Didn't you want to go with her? She said that I should stay with you 'cause I'm a boy. That you can't be left alone. That's impressive. Anyway, you should see her later. I'll look up her number in the phone book. I won't see her. It's okay, I feel at peace. She seemed so happy, didn't she? You have Yuuko, but I was worried about Mom before. You, a brat, don't need to be worrying about adults. Just go see her, okay? - You need to see her. - Why? Is it because I'm going to die? That's why I shouldn't see her. If I do, it'll be hard for her. If she knew that her son is going to die because he's sick, the day before her wedding. What do I do? You were weird, and Zenpei was weird too. I thought something was going on, and then I overheard. At the hospital, after the parent-kid chorus. The people at the hospital were whispering about it. What to do...? Dad, sorry for causing you so much trouble. He is going to die. He is going to die. What do I do? What should I do for him? I don't know. Wait. Tell me. I don't know. Hey! Say something. Please. You don't know, right? You yourself are a child. You only see yourself. You have never been an adult. A child can't do anything for another child. How sad, how terrible. You're up early. - You're awake? - Yes. The weather is great today, too! How about we don't have a father son relationship starting from today? Huh? How about we go as a boy and a boy? I used to be a juvenile delinquent. I won't teach you how to skip school, smoke tobacco, or how to pick up a woman. Well, when you become a high school student, we'll probably be great friends. Anyway, we're throwing out the father idea. Boy to boy from now. - Okay? - Okay! St. Mary's Cathedral Argyle Prison But now, it is a shopping center. Kings Cross Road Wallaby Koala Wombat White-bellied Sea Eagle Short-beaked Echidna Tasmanian Devil Featherdale Wildlife Park. People can play with animals, such as wallaby's and koalas. Koalas feel uneasy unless they are hugging onto something. Because they only eat southern blue gum, Koalas' urine has the fragrance of southern blue gum. Hey, if you want to, you're allowed to stay here forever. We could even go see all of Australia. I'll go home. If I get more sick here, it'll be troublesome for you, and if Mom finds out, that'll be hard for her. I already played hard, so I'm fine. It was really fun. Thanks, Dad. Hey, this Koala was fun, wasn't it? Hugging onto everything like this, huh? It's cute, isn't it? You don't hug, do you? There really isn't anyone to hug, is there? No mom, and I'm not very useful either. But from now on, you can hug me, alright? What's wrong, huh? Hey, are you alright? Huh? My ears are strange. Try swallowing your spit. My ears are ringing. That's weird, the plane's altitude hasn't changed. It's shaking, it's shaking! You're probably just dizzy. It's four now. We can go to the doctor in two hours, alright? It's spinning! It's spinning around and around! Wait a bit. Don't move, okay? We are sorry to disturb you during your sleep, but we have an announcement. There is a person with a sudden illness on this plane. If there is anyone that is a doctor, or a nurse, please let a flight attendant know immediately. May I have your attention, please? There is a sick passenger on board. And if there is a doctor or a nurse on this flight... - Is it hurting? -...please contact... ...one of our cabinet attendants immediately. We have a doctor here. I heard most of it. Your child, right? He's experiencing renewed brain pressure. There isn't anything we can do here. Have Narita prepare an emergency operation. - Call a brain surgeon. - Alright. And make sure to keep him rested. Dad, am I going to die? I'm going to die, aren't I? I'm scared. You go alone when you die, right? I'm scared. I'm scared, dad! Hug me, hold on to your dad. Hold on. You're doing great. I won't forgive you if you've finally hugged me and this is the last time! Ken! Ken... Doctor, he fell asleep. That's not good, right? He's going to die if he falls asleep, isn't he? Ken, you can do it! Come on, you idiot! Ken! Don't fall asleep! Ken! Hey, Ken! Worrying about other people instead of yourself. Are you going to give up just like that? Hey! Ken, wake up, wake up! Wake up! You're going to do the parent-kid chorus again, right? You can conduct, and I'll sing! Okay? Hey, Ken! Please conduct, you can do it! I memorized the song! There was a part that goes, green, green, right? Green, green, blue sky. Come on! Hey! Green, green, the birds, in the blue sky. Hey! Ken! Ken! Please conduct. Okay? Come on. I can't believe this. How can I? This is too much, too harsh! Congratulations! I am coming in! Yoshinaga Company is pleased! Because it's a big deal! We are doing seven times better than others! We got a lot of money, anyway. Everything is moving toward a good direction! That one case was solved, and they just felt empathy for you. It's almost time. Ah, Hiroshi. The company is wanting a ceremony for your loss. And so, by next week, you need to... Don't mistake yourself as anything great. You're a tragedy of a father. You need to humble yourself. You're trash, you need to sell it! Is that what it is?
