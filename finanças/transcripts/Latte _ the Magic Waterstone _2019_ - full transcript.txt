Hiding low, hiding tall, Princess Latte gets them all! Bingo! Oops! Tada! Perfect landing. Triple cool... 'Latte and the Magic Waterstone' Oh. We can't keep going like this, Vilho. Day by day, we find less and less. Our water reserves are down four and a half pumpkins, this included. I fear that soon the stream will stop completely! I'm afraid you're right. We need a long term solution. A few drops of dew won't be enough. Get everyone to meet for Grand Council, at sundown. Okay. Hey Hopper! Everyone's meeting at the pond to play pawprint. - You coming? - Umm. Mum? - Okay. - Yes! - Run along! - Wait up! Wait for me! My turn! Hey! Stop it! Leave me alone! I sense the presence of evil! Look at that. You are a weirdo, Tjum. Who leaves tracks like that? Like... a lame duck. Or... a snail trail. Look! Slimey slithering snail trail! It's my toes. What's wrong with toes? You don't even have toes. - Tjum! - Hey! Stop it. That's so dumb! Leave me alone. Showed those scaredy critters, didn't we. Tjum? Are you okay? I knew it. It was just Latte. Check out Tjum. He thought it was a real monster. What about you-all, huh? Waaah! "Where's my Daddy?" At least some of us have a Daddy. Come on guys, let's go play somewhere else! These freaks just mess everything up. - You ruined everything. - What? Those guys are a bunch of bullies. A simple 'thankyou' would be fine. You made me look like a total fool! Hey! Great. If you like being a moron so much, why don't you just go hang out with those guys? And let them laugh at you. Stupid nut-head. They're all nut-heads. All of them! And they can all kiss my spiky butt! Where's mummy and Daddy? At the Great Council. They'll be back home for dinner. Why are you so dirty? What happened? Nothing happened. Leave me alone, Mira. - Did you have an accident? - No. Well, yeah... Sort of. Oh. It was a Latte accident again. - Yeah! - Just leave me alone! Oh no! No way! Just my lucky day. Lost a nut, nut-head? Uhh yup. Thanks. What... What is that? My water. Why? Your water? Water belongs to everybody! I collected that water. So that water belongs to me! Look over there! A three headed snail! Everybody puts the water they collect in the pumpkins for all of us! Us? As if anyone ever gave me any water from the pumpkins. Listen, nobody cares about me. And that's just fine. 'Cos I can take care of myself! So if you would kindly just give me back my water! This water belongs in the pumpkins. Give me my water! Everybody's water! Ha! Too fast for you! Who's too slow? Give it! Come get it yourself! - I win! - No way! Just admit - you're not special - and you'll get it back. - Don't you dare! Oh, I'm gonna get you! Tjum? Tjum? I'm fine, I'm okay. Oh no. Get out of the pumpkin. Now! Oops. Is that what you call a fancy pumpkin? - No I wouldn't. - Quick. We've gotta hide! Pump-kin. - Oh! You get it? - I see. Oh no! If what I see is what you see what we see is a catastrophe. Oh. I see. They didn't see us. We're good. Good? - We spilled all the water! - So what? You don't need to cry over spilled water. Are you crazy? We have to tell them what happened! Right. So everyone can blame the hedgehog. - What do you mean? - Come on. What forest are you living in? The hedgehog always gets the blame for everything. - A complete disaster! - Devastating. Calm down. Tell us what happened. - The big water pumpkin is broken. - Kaput and smashed! - How couldd this happen? - All the water is gone. - What do we do now? - See? They already know. We have to tell them. It was an accident. No way. My father says you should always tell the truth. I'm going to tell them. No, you can't! I can fix this. It's not fixable. Get out of the way! - I'm okay everybody. I'm okay. - Tjum? Hi... Dad. You're disturbing the Grand Council. - Get home and take care of Mira. - Wait! Tjum, do you know anything about who spilled the water? I bet you it was the hedgehog who did it! - She's right! - I bet it was the hedgehog. Do you know what happened? Speak up. - It was my fault! - What? You? - Oh no. - It was an accident. - I'm really sorry, Dad. - What? - Did you hear that? - Hey. What're you doing? Silence! Accident, or no accident, the water is gone. And it is just a matter of time before the well dries up completely. We have a serious problem. And the sooner we face it... Because of those kids we have less water left than before! We're going to die! Stopped flow, and water is low, and fearful days draw near. Oh no, not that old fool. A way Korp knows, a hero on a journey goes. To bring back water... here. Korp, please. The last thing we need right now is you giving everybody false hope. False hope leads hope. But wisdom is what's true. Return the Magic Waterstone, - and spring the well. - What nonsense is that? A magic stone of water! - A Magic Waterstone! - Magic sounds like lies. Quiet down. Everyone has the right to speak at the Grand Council. Once upon a time... a Magic Waterstone appeared on White Mountain's peak. Where the Magic Waterstone met earth, erupted a bountiful spring of turquoise waters so clear, they glowed. And all reached brightened, and all rejoiced. 'Til Bantur, the bear king stole the stone, and all that was is now a dying well. I don't like this guy. Who is he? Is he in charge of this forest or somethin'? I'm gonna come and find him. Brave hero must journey to Bear Forest to save the well. And the people whose thirst it quenches. I would journey myself, but er... No brave heroes here? There is no Magic Waterstone. We don't have time to listen to that old coot. Raving, raving. We don't need these lies. Such fairytale nonsense! The Magic Waterstone can bring back the water to the forest and save you all. All you have to do is go and get it! Even if it was true, and this magic stone did exist, we can't leave the clearing. Too scared to find any bravery, are we? Korp is right. You're all just too scared. You'd rather die of thirst than go get the waterstone. You don't even believe it's real. Wait, Latte. Listen to the little hedgehog. Even crazier than the old bird. I'm Princess Latte, and I'm not afraid of anything. - I'll do it! - Brave little hedgehog! - Brave, like her father. - "Brave"? Hopefully, like her father, - she will never come back. - Never come back will she. Of course the pool little one's upset and confused. Come on. There is no Waterstone. - Crazier than the old bird. - What's wrong with you? I will find the Magic Waterstone, and save your stupid forest! Latte, wait! Leave her alone, son. She's not going anywhere, believe me. She's just a stubborn little hedgehog. Let the Grand Council continue. Rabbit? I'm not scared of some big, fat, greedy bear. Just you all wait and see. Hello? Someone there? Timber! Are you crazy child? Standing around a construction site? Get out of here now! What're you doing? Building a dam. What does it look like? A dam? What for? What else? For the water! You aren't the sparkiest firefly in the meadow, are ya? Not smart? So here you are, building a dam, but there isn't any water? - Who's the idiot? - Timber! There was a big landslide down the river bed, but when the water comes back, my construction will re-direct the river, and the water will be roaring down again. Water is not coming, unless... Gotta be prepared. Better be a busy beaver before the bad befalls. Did you get that? B..b..bad has already befallen. But I'm gonna get the Waterstone, and save us all. - So don't worry. - Timber! Waterstone? Never heard of it. Well, it's for real. And I'm gonna go get it. Umm, do you know the way to the North Forest? North Forest? Where the mighty ferocious King Bantur lives? Yep. Exactly. Follow the dry riverbed, down around the landslide, and keep going. - Thanks! - Best you walk outside the riverbed, 'cos if the water comes, you'll get plum flushed away. I'll keep that in mind. Get your work done, and soon you'll have lots of water. No rest for the wicked. - Is she gone? - Latte? Nah. I'm sure she's just sleeping, like always. Hedgehogs, you know. But, if she is going, she's all alone out there. Alone? Ah, don't worry, she won't go. I like Latte. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. Daddy says, it's very, very dangerous out there. Come in kids. Dinner's ready! I made a delicious nut bread. On my way! Dangerous? Where are you when I really need you? Nobody believes in me... or in you. I'm gonna show them, Dad! I'm gonna get that Waterstone... I mean, Korp is right! Isn't he? The Waterstone is real, right? Daddy, give me a sign! Thanks Daddy! You are the bestest! Latte? Why do you have to be so stubborn? Now somebody has to go and get you back. Hello? Latte? Latte? Oh no! Are you there? Latte! Here you are. Seriously? Are you following me? Follow? I don't follow you. Listen! You need to come back with me, right now. - Or else... - Or else what? You will get eaten by all the wild animals around here. I'm not planning on getting eaten today. I will bring back the water. Have you ever been so far from home? Nopedy nope! It's so dangerous out here! There are wild animals everywhere. What is dangerous? There aren't any... ...wild animals! See! You are scared too! Right? - Uh, oh... - Uh, oh, what? Run! Tjum! Tjum! Yes! You made it! Me and my big mouth! Take that! Oh no. I can't watch! You're too slow! Watch out! Turn right! Turn left! Oh, careful! Rock straight ahead! This must be the landslide the beaver was talking about. Holy hazelnuts! I wish I was a flying squirrel.. Timber! That was a precision cut. Ooh, tasty! Now you shouldn't walk in that riverbed kiddos. The water will flush you away. Dang dam's nearly done! Got a piece of good oak there. Ha-ha-lemme geddit geddit. Keep up the good work, Mr Beaver. Latte, you're going in the wrong direction. Home is that way. Hey Hopper. You still looking for water? I can't even make paw prints anymore. The mud is so much drier. How will Latte and Tjum find their way back, if we can't leave any paw prints anymore? Don't know. Kids, get out of the sun! You have to stay in the shadows to conserve your water. Now, now. Don't worry. Not even the tiniest trace. Squirrels and a hedgehog aren't as big as bears. Just because you came up with this stupid tale of the Waterstone! I haven't seen Latte, either. I have to find them. I know you're worried, but our focus must be on the responsibility for everybody here. I need you to divide our last store of berries and water equally among all the families. You think they believed Korp's nonsense about the Waterstone, and... I'll tell Korp. He will find them. With his eyes wide open, vigilantly, from above. This... is not... making it... easier! Come... back... with me! - Or... or... - Or what? - I'll tell my Dad. - Good idea! Go home and tell him. Latte! Wait! No time. I'm on a mission! Turn around, pig head! You are in my way, tattle butt! - Slug muncher! - Nutjob! Slime blower! Wow. Where are we? - Water! - Just mud, dear. Though hardly even that by now. M...m...mud? Who's there? - What are you? - A beautiful Princess, I was. But I stumbled into foreign homes without asking. Now look what's become of me. You were a Princess? Well, was. But not am. Anyhow. I'm still pretty! So tell me now: how come you landed in my living room? We're on our way to the Bear Forest to get the Magic Waterstone. It's late, little lambs. And the sun is setting soon. You shouldn't be out there any more. My fearful friend the Lynx wakes up, and he is always very hungry. Lynx? Big angry cat with pointy ears? We already passed him. Easy peasy. He was way too slow for us. True, he is rather slow and sleepy in the sunlight, but you should not meet him at midnight! Why don't you two spend the night here with me and continue your quarrel tomorrow, hmm? If you don't have other plans, of course. We might consider it. Do you have anything to eat? I was going to make a hearty hedgehog and savory squirrel stew. Just kidding. But you can try the flowers. They might still have some nectar in them. I'm starving. You need to jump higher! So you want to claim the Waterstone from old Bantur, huh? He is not gonna like that. I don't care. Would you be so kind and tell Latte that this Waterstone doesn't really exist? But the Waterstone does indeed exist, dear. - See. - But... my Papa said it doesn't. Your Papa also told you, that you'd get eaten if you left the clearing, didn't he. You don't look very eaten to me, little squirrel. Not eaten yet. Wait... how do you know what my Papa said? Don't just sit there on your butt, nut head. Help me get to that flower, it's too high. Well done. Well done! Dinner is served! It's so good. I wish my cheeks were bigger! Where did you get all this? This pretty toad knows a few tricks. Now, it's time to sleep. Sleep? I'm a hedgehog. I don't slee... Sweet dreams, my dears. Sleep well? I kept dreaming there was a bear. Then, I realised it was Latte. You two make a better team together, than either of you alone do. No we're not. I just need her to go back. I don't want to get lost out here. Or eaten, or something. I'm on my way. I just told Tjum that you need to stay together. No we don't! Tjum wants to go home. Baby needs his Dada. Is that so? Who followed Latte into the woods to protect her? And who was brave enough to leave the clearing? See? You are a good team. Team? Tjum will accompany you. I don't need a babysitter, especially not a scaredy squirrel. I seem to recall Tjum helping you get away from a certain ravenous Lynx. - You told her? Show off! - I didn't. Listen carefully now. You're about to enter the realm of the wolves. Your path leads through a wasteland drier than anything you've ever imagined. How will we survive that? Good question. This bag contains Water Berries. One berry will quench both your thirsts. Cool! - Tjum, you will carry the bag. - What? Thank you. You're very kind. How come he gets to carry the bag? He'll divide them wisely. Whatever. I don't need the berries. I'll find the Waterstone that will give us all the water we need. Bye, Princess Greta! Wait for me! Beware of Lupo and his wolves. They're not known for telling the truth. Rocks! Rocks! I'm sick of rocks! I mean, come on! How many rocks do you need to make a mountain? How 'bout some good old stairs? I'm so thirsty! - Tjum! - What now? I need those Water Berries. Oh, come on! Is that... the Wolf Forest? No wolf in sight yet. But I'll let you know if I see one! If... you'll give me a Water Berry. Nice try! My tongue is so fat and dry. I just need one berry! Really? What? I'm not sure. They're terrified. Why? No-one here to be frightened of. Except maybe us. Maybe someon is after our Water Berries. We should swallow them before they get stolen! Latte! We need a place to hide.. Occupied. Hey! Occupied! Where's my little squirrel, where's my little atch-Tjum? There's the little squirrel! Hi, fellows. Looking for something? Well, well. What do we have here? What do we have here? Nice, two fresh and juicy guests! So, Lynx got your tongue? Who are you? I'm Princess Latte. A Princess? My father is the king of Zogoten Forest. And if you dare hurt even one of my spines, you will regret it! Well, what a coincidence. I too, am a Prince. Prince Lupo the Great. You're what? Run! Why in such a hurry? I hereby invite you to stay with us, and enjoy a royal feast. A feast? Thank you. Thank you, but...uh, we're sorry, to have to refuse your generous offer. We are on an important mission, and have to go. A mission? What mission might that be, your highness? A royal journey to retreive the Waterstone. Oh! A tiny hedgehog and a scraggly squirrel are going to get the Magic Waterstone from King Bantur? No-one has ever tried, and lived. We never tried. Which is why we're still alive. We should really be going. Right, your highness? - Yeah, I guess so. - Well then. We will not be the ones to stop your royal progress. Your highness, may your path be paved with success. The treats are leaving. Whoah! - That was so close, Latte. - "Highness". Okay, listen. Remember what Greta said about the wolves. Are we good, or are we good? We tricked the wolves! We tricked the wolves! You got a good idea. Why'd you let them go, Lupo? Ah, c'mon. You can tell me. You have no clue, do you? She might be exactly what I needed. Sure we're walking in the right direction? Nope. Not sure at all. But holler if you see some fresh running water and lush green trees then we have found the Bear Forest. Is there maybe a Plan B? Well, we could always go back to the wolves and join their royal feast. Talking about a royal feast... I really need a royal Water Berry. Oh please, noble Knight Tjum! Okay. Here's the deal... I'm gonna give you one berry, but, you have to earn it! What? The nutshell thing? Are you serious? Now, I will move all the nutshells around... - Everyone knows how to play nutshells. - Ready? - Ready! - Here we go! See. It's there. Just get to the end part! How did you get so good at this? So, where's the Water Berry? This is easy! It's...umm...It's... D'you know which one? - This one. - Y'sure? - What? - Wrong. You lose. No Water Berry for your highness. - You cheated! - Did not. Under one of these shells is the Water Berry. - Lemme see. - Pick one. But no prize. It's not the same without a prize. C'mon! You have a 50-50 chance of being right. That one? This is... magical! Wait! Show me what's under that one. Okay then. Let's check if the Water Berry lies under the last one. Master of magic! You cheated. Hand it over. Here. Take one half. - Hey, Tjum? - Yeah? I... D'you know, I'm not a real Princess. You... everyone has a family. A mother, father, sister, brother. Everyone should... ...have somebody. And I was wondering, why don't I have someone? So, I started calling myself a Princess and lying about my father. My father isn't the king of Zogoten Forest. I'm alone. That's the truth. - I know. - You... you know? My father told me. - But, you never said that... - Said what? Princess Latte, the daughter of the king from Zogoten Forest, belongs to our clearing, like everyone else. But... it's a lie. And you don't do lies. Some lies don't matter. They just feel right. Besides, if you're not a Princess, then why have a Knight at your service? Right? Right. Latte! It's already morning! We fell asleep! Let's go. You are walking in the wrong direction! Today we find the Waterstone! Not. The Bear Forest can't be that far away now. The pumpkins back home must be almost empty by now. Don't worry. We'll make it. Hey lazy butt! Keep moving. Latte! This is hopeless! Another dead end! We should go back, Latte. I'm worried about everyone back home. That is exactly why we have to keep going forward. - Wait. - Over there! That tree trunk! We gotta be close by now. There's nothing here No bears, and no Waterstone. We just haven't found it yet. Maybe it's because the Waterstone isn't real after all! It's real. Princess Greta said so, and so did Prince Lupo. This is crazy. They need us at home right now, helping to refill the pumpkins. Need us? Don't you understand? Nobody cares if I'm there or not! Nobody! - I have to keep going, Tjum. - I'm going back. Here, take the Berries. Give them to your family. They need them more than me. Go back, Tjum. I don't need you. - I'll make it on my own. - Wait! Latte, I want you to have them. - I don't need them! I don't need you! - Come on Latte. You'll need water! Oh no! Now see what you did! Nutskull! So that's what Greta calls a 'good team', huh? Why'd you even follow me in the first place? Do you really believe you would've made it this far without me? 'Course I would. You're just slowing me down! Know what your problem is? You can never admit you're wrong. Not even a tiny bit. Go and prove to yourself, or whatever else it is you're trying to do. Nobody cares! Latte! Latte! Latte? Are you okay? If you mean spikes, arms and legs are okay, yeah. Otherwise: No! I'm not okay with you! Look for a way up. There must be a path somewhere. I'll help you. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll find the Waterstone myself. Go back to the clearing and your precious family. They're waiting. Ahh! You're such a dumbhead! Why don't you ever listen? Latte? Whoah! Latte, you were right. I have to find Latte... Round and round and round... Zut alor! This will be perfection! Krass, how much longer? I'm all dizzy. I hope I didn't hear you complaining? We will do this lesson again and again until you get it right! And no extra special treatment for you, Amaroo. And battement! Come on now, with grace! Arabesque! Now some somersaults! Roll and roll and roll. Class is over! Everyone back to the castle. What's so funny? Nothing. It's gone. What's gone? Catch up, Amaroo. Yes sir. Hey there. Whoever you are, I know you're in my fur. And that's okay. But if you don't want the guard to see you, you better move to the left. Only bears are allowed to enter the castle. Hold still! That tickles. - Wait! - What? Oh, it's you, Prince Amaroo. Welcome back. - Fleas? Eww. - Fleas? I don't... oh, yes. Fleas. Whoah! Shh! Wow. He's a stupid squirrel! I'll find my own way! Whoah, nice. Somebody knows how to make it comfy. Maybe a short nap. Lupo the Wolf seemed to know you. Have you ever met him? He treated me like a real Princess. Can you give me a clue... where to find the Waterstone. Excuse me! Daddy? What? I am not your Daddy. - But... - Get out of my bed! You're a hedgehog! - Breaking news. - Holy hazelnuts! Don't you see? You're a hedgehog. I'm a hedgehog! I'm a Princess, so you must be a King! Drought seems to've muddled your mind. Oh, but, I'm on my way to the Bear Castle, to bring back the Magic Waterstone. Hello? Dad? Papi? Are you listening? Do you hear that? What? I don't hear anything. That is the point. Stop talkin'. And for the record, I am not your Daddy, or your Papa or your Dadda or your Padre! Are you sure you're not my Daddy? Listen up, listen good, kid. I ain't no King. And I don't got no Palace, and I ain't nobody's Pop. Not that I know of. I live alone, like all hedgehogs do. Whatever your Pappy was, he was a loner too, And that means he ain't comin' back. Now go away! Well, I'm very sorry. But maybe you're just a lonely old grump! But my Daddy isn't. And neither am I. Oh yeah? Hedgehogs are lonesome creatures. That's just how it is. Not me. I'm not lonesome. I have a lot of furry friends. You have friends? Right. Who're your friends? I have plenty! So... There is Tjum. He's a squirrel. And then there is, umm... Tjum, is a squirrel. Did I mention that... Right. Tjum, huh? You are far from home, in the middle of the night, all alone. If this Tjum is your friend, where is he then, huh? My... I don't know. So, you have no friends. You better deal with it kid. Us hedgehogs live alone. Always have, always will. And that, is that! Oh please. Turn off the waterworks, lonesome cowboy. We're in a drought. That was a joke. - Just leave me alone! - Love to! But this is my lodge. How about I tell you where the Waterstone is? Will you leave then? I don't care about the Waterstone. Or anything! Really? I'm gonna live alone forever? And ever, and ever. Good wish. Get used to it, kid. Don't come out yet! Hide 'till my Momma says goodnight. Sleep well, my cuddly little cubby. Give your Mom a kissy-poo. Okay, okay! Enough already! - Honey dreams. - 'Night, Mama. Now! She's gone. Hey. What kind of bear are you? I'm a very small Nut Bear. Nut Bear? Good one. I'm a bear Bear. My name's Amaroo. Who're you? I'm Tjum. You have your very own water fountain? Can I have a drink? Wow! Of course you can. - Now that we have some. - What do you mean? After the big landslide, we didn't have any water. It was so terrible. But luckily not for long. - My father, the Bear King... - Wait! King Bantur is your father? Yeah. Which is cool, you know? But guess what! While everyone thought we would die of thirst, - my father brought a magic stone here. - The Magic Waterstone. So it's... Cool, huh? It's all true. The Waterstone exists. And your father stole it! What? My father is a thief? Do you have any idea what it means for my little sister Mira, my parents, and the rest of us? You don't have any water? I thought my father was a hero. And, you, Tjum... I mean, Wow. You came here alone to save your family. No. Not alone. It was me and Latte. But, I lost her. - Latte? - Latte is... my best friend. She believed from the start that the Waterstone is real, and needs to be where it belongs. But if you take it, then we won't have any water. No, no. See... once we take the Waterstone back to White Mountain, we'll all have water. I promise. But first, I have to find Latte. Lonesome Cowboy! Right! I'm fine being alone. Better than fine! You don't know how lucky you are, Tjum. Hedgehogs apparently have to live alone. I'm talking to stones now? What's the matter with me? Rise and shine, Spikey Grandpa! Wakey wakey! Great. It's you again. Show me how to get to the Waterstone. Alright, alright. There's a secret passageway to the Bear Castle. Come on. Follow me, but no talkin'. Oh okay. Turquoise! It's beautiful! - Just like Korp said. - Clam up and start swimmin'. - You can swim, right? - Sure I can swim! I live next to a river. Now that is what I call a fine hedgehog. The stream gets stronger the closer you get to the source. - And the source... - ...And the source is the Waterstone. Smarty pants. Okay. The bears are dangerous. Try to be quiet. And... Don't come back here again. Take care, Grandpa Spikey! Silence at last. What's the matter with me? All hedgehogs love solitude. That's what makes a hedgehog a hedgehog. I'm a hedgehog. Stop it! Hide! Prince Amaroo! All hail! It's dark. No-one is allowed to go outside now. What? I'm the Prince. I can go wherever and whenever I want. Ah, I need to check with the King. You want to wake up my father? Go ahead. At your own risk. Of course not. I would never disturb your father. - Your tail! - What? - Hold up! - Tjum! Another friend of yours? Mighty King Bantur! Okay. Now I'm super impressed. Whoah. The guy must be a giant. Mighty King Bantur? More like the Mighty King Snore, am I right? No wonder he sleeps alone. The Magic Waterstone! I knew it! - Blowfish? - That don't look like no fish. I'm not tasty fish. Throw me back into the water! Something fishy's goin' on. We have a trespasser! Oww! Hey! That's no way to treat a Princess! Take me to your King! I was so close. Tjum? Latte! It really is you! How did you... What're you doing here? I was searching for you, and then I fell down a cliff. You did what? Then, I got on Amaroo's furry back. Ama-who? Amaroo, my new bear friend. Your new bear friend? Yeah. He's great. Great? But... I thought we were... Never mind. I'm sorry if were a jerk. I'm sorry you were a jerk, too. Hey! Do you ever think we'll get out of here? - And get back home? - Back? - I'm not going back. Not now - We have to. I miss my family. They must be worried sick by now. And look. I saved the last Water Berry for them. We can't go back without the Waterstone. Here. You look thirsty. Friends share, right? Stay away from my friend! Oh! Calm down! - You have to fight me first! - Amaroo! Tjum? Oh. I've heard about you. Come on, you two. Let's get out of here before... Is that you, Prince Amaroo! King Bantur won't be happy about this. No, he won't be happy. I order you to release us! I'm your Prince! You're a Prince? A real Prince? I wouldn't disturb my Daddy, especially during his morning routine. You know how mad he gets. Let's see how mad he gets, when he hears about you trying to help these two escape. And stretch! All the muscles have to warm up. Begin! Once the music starts... - King Bantur! - Yes. Like that. King Bantur, 'scuse me, 'scuse me. - King Bantur? Over here. King! King Bantur! - Guards! How dare you disturb the morning routine! - You bears, keep the beat. - King Bantur! Great King Bantur, sir! We need to report a serious breach! Amaroo! Not again. Remember. Watch the hands. Go on. Not you! Wait. I want... light! Guards, what is this? King Bantur, we found two intruders in your castle. Your son, Prince Amaroo, was found helping them to escape from the dungeon. Intruders? What are you? A hedgehog, and a sorry excuse for a squirrel? He's a Nut Bear! Hah! You need to learn one animal from another. There are no such thing as Nut Bears, son. Incredible! Wait... you lied to me? - Stop! Wait, you dolts! - Oh... I did not give you the sign. I have some royal business to deal with first. So, you think you can just enter my castle. Your Majesty, we come from a forest far away. With dead leaves and dry ponds... That is not my problem. And, we need to take the Waterstone back... - Take? The Waterstone? - Yes, your Majesty. You... two sneaky, prickly, scraggly, pair of thieves! But you are the thief! Me? What nonsense! You stole the Waterstone, and that was not fair! Stolen? Liar! Guards! Throw the little rodents out! - Now! - Let's go. Bears! Halt! We are not done yet. Make us proud! That is so catchy! Tres magnifique! Perfect! Kings are not quite what I was expecting them to be. Follow my lead. Everyone's distracted. Leave now! - You keep watch from above. - And you take the stone. Oh, is beautiful, no? Tada! Tjum! Tjum, I need some help. Wow! The Magic Waterstone! It is beautiful! The Magic Waterstone! Stop! Hurry! Hurry! Stop! Amaroo, get them! Run! Oh man. I'm in so much trouble. Stupid bears! Stop dancing! Get after them! Do I really have to do everything myself? Tada! Whoah! It's beautiful. - I almost wanna keep it. - Latte! Kidding. Let's go! Come on, noble and Spikey Princess! The mission's not over yet. Nya, nya, nya na! Bye, big Snorey King! Come on, Latte! I will get you! Good job, Amaroo. Your Daddy should really be proud of you. Well, fat chance of that. But thank you so much for your help, Bear Prince. Just promise me you'll find a way to send us some water too. The water belongs to all animals. We promise! Goodbye, my brave friends. Latte the Hedgehog, and Tjum the Nut Bear. Goodbye. I can't do this. I won't let you fall again. I promise. Don't look down. Look at me. Don't look down. Look at you. Don't look down. I will deal with you later. They're putting the Waterstone back where it belongs. Nonsense! It belongs with me! Hurry! Hurry! He's right behind us. Really! That helps! I'm nearly not nervous enough. I'm gonna fall! Oh no. Not again. Tjum! - Oh, I'm here. - Well, get...here... - Wait. - That's not easy! Papa! Papa. Tjum! We have to go. Oh, how I love it when a plan comes together so perfectly. Oh boy. Food. Now I'm even hungrier. - Almost there! - This must be the magical place. Doesn't look so magical. - Princess Latte... - Lupo! I'm delighted our paths cross again. Yes! I'm delighted too! My dear Princess, I was wondering if your royal mission was successful? - What mission? - He means the Waterstone. Bingo. If someone could trick the stone from old King Bantur, and still be alive... it would be you. - Right? - I... So. Where is it? We... Why are you asking? Because, dear Princess... Hand the stone over! Now! The stone is mine! King Bantur! You heard him! Scram, you mangy pack of flea-bitten hounds! For sure, you'll take the chance to steal the Waterstone. This powerful stone is mine. - He's right. - Just shutup. This magical power belongs to the King! Of course. The Lynx! What're you doing here? - Great! You let them go! - We should eat them! - You won't get away! - Okay. Wow. So, here we are. Maybe we should... negotiate? Negotiate? Ha! Are you kidding? - The stone is mine! - No, it belongs to the wolves. Fighting won't solve anything. Why not try a game? - A game? - Game? Did someone say 'game'? A game? A game to prove your skill. The smartest and fastest will get the stone. I promise. - I'm the strongest. - I'm the smartest. I will now put the Waterstone... - under one of these. - Don't be ridiculous. The shells are much too small. How can he move so quickly? - Faster than flickering fireflies! - See? Wow, that is fast! Make your choice. Does someone wanna change their minds? Okay! Let's start with the shell the Lynx has chosen. No Waterstone for Lynx! Under mine, is the stone. And now, the second shell. The one picked by Lupo, representative of the great pack of Wolves. I'm sure I won. Of course. No Waterstone... here. Darn! Come on! I was sure it had to be that one! I knew it! I win! The Bear King always wins. Come on! Show me my stone. - And the last shell goes to... - What! Where is it? What did you do with my magic stone? You dare to fool us? Okay, let's bring this to an end! Come on, you stupid stone! Latte! Times up. Set the stone. We didn't come all this way for this! Please! The earth is shaking! Tjum? I'm coming! We did it! We really did it! We tricked them all. Didn't I tell you! The fastest and smartest gets the stone. And that is... us! Korp! Kudos, you young heroes. Your father would be proud. We really did it! Locked up and watertight... Beautiful mud! It's time for my beauty mask! Good job, hedgehog and squirrel. Well done. Oh, and good job, Beaver. Damn. I was tryin' to sleep. She went and doggone done it. Yeah, thats... I'm proud of you, girl. What's that? Wait. The water's back! Tjum and Latte did it! Hallelujah! Oh blessed day! - It looks so good! - Water? Is this true? - We're saved! - The water is back! - Hello! - Mira! Tjum! Latte! It's us! We're back! Oh my carrots. My big brother is the best in all the world! Mama! Let me through! - Tjum! - Papa. I know we squirrels aren't heroes, but I had to help Latte. Tjum, no. You did the right thing all along. I was wrong. I'm so glad you're back, son. I'm very proud of you, and very... very happy that you're back. Thankyou, our own Princess Latte. Latte... We know we can't replace your Dad, but we would be very happy to have you as a part of our family. Really? This is the best day ever! Welcome back, you two. - Come on. Play with us. - Yeah. Play with us. - Let's play together. - That'll be fun. I told you Papa! Here's the water! You will make a wiser King than I when you rule. And now some somersaults, clowns and turns! I'm proud of you.
