[exciting music] [water splashing] [crowd screaming] [man yells] [crowd yelling] [woman screaming] [plates shattering] [crowd screaming] [woman screams] [crowd screaming] [water splashing] [crowd screaming] [plates shattering] [explosion booms] [crowd screaming] [waves crashing] [waterfall splashing] [peaceful music] [ducks quacking] Tuppence. Tommy! You! [water splashing] Of all people, you! Ducks. Ducks. [giggles] [giggles] Oh dear, old bean. Demobbed? Yes, two months ago, you? Five months ago. Spent. Oh, Tommy. Well, no, old thing, not in riotous dissipation, no such luck. Cost of living, you know. My dear boy, there's nothing I don't know Can you afford one anthropence? Of course I can. Oh, you always were a shocking liar. Come on, let's adjourn. A pot of tea, a currant bun and each play our own. [cheerful music] Anyway, there I was in that wretched hospital coming out of the anaesthetic, and there you were. A wretched nurse. Well, I thought you were an angel. I thought you were dying, you looked awful. You looked exactly as you'd looked all those years before, up a tree, [laughs] in an orchard, chucking apples down to the rest of us. It was an affecting reunion, I agree. [giggles] That's not true, you did look rather cleaner. Anyway, a month later, they sent me back to the front. 1916. 1916. It seems a lifetime ago. It seems a lifetime ago. When I told her she wouldn't have the flat after all. It was simply a bargain, my dear, just like the one Mabel Lewis brought back from Paris. Ridiculous conversations people have. Do you know, I heard someone talking in the street yesterday about somebody called Jane Finn. Did you ever hear such a ludicrous name? How about a job? Any prospects? No, there aren't any jobs. Anyway, even if there were, they wouldn't give them to me. I mean, why should they? I'm an ex-serviceman with absolutely no qualifications whatsoever. Money is all I think about, money, morning, noon, and night. Same here, I've tried all the orthodox ways of making money. How about the unorthodox? Hmm? Look, if only we could get ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them. And just how do you propose to get in touch with our would-be employers? Advertisement. Got a pencil and paper? Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. Somewhere. -Ah, got one. -Good. There. Now, how about young officer wounded in the war, twice wounded in the war. Here we are. Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No reasonable offer refused. I should think any offer we get to that would be a pretty unreasonable one. Tommy, you're a genius. That's much more chic. No unreasonable offer refused. [laughs] [peaceful music] [Whittington] May I speak to you for a moment? If you're going to make a nuisance of yourself, I warn you, I shall scream. I mean no disrespect. But I happened to overhear part of the conversation you had with the young gentleman in the tea rooms. I think I may be able to help you. Is that the reason you followed me here? It was the only reason, I assure you. Whittington's the name. Will you call upon me at my office tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock? I will lay the details of my proposition before you. £100 down, and all expenses paid. That is my proposition. And the nature of the work? Shall we say, a pleasure trip? Where to? [Whittington] Paris. Oh. What could be more delightful than to turn the clock back a few years? A very few, I'm sure, and reenter, one of those [speaks in French] that Paris abounds in. Finishing school? Of an informal nature. For how long? That depends. Possibly three months. You would have to get in the character of my ward and I should have to insist on absolute secrecy. And there are no other conditions? None whatever. Surely you're not going to refuse, it's a very liberal offer, Miss... Finn. Jane Finn. Very clever, young woman, but not very wise. Now who's been talking, Rita? Rita? No, Rita knows nothing about me. I should advise you not to play the fool with me. How much do you know? Very little indeed. How much do you want? Money? Well, I presume this was intended as a blackmail. Or is it something else that you're after? [door knocking] Come in. [Brown] Message for you, sir. [phone ringing] [paper shuffling] Thank you, Brown. You may go. Come back tomorrow at the same time. I'm busy now. There's £50 to be going on with. [paper shuffling] [peaceful piano music] I didn't want to give him my real name I didn't want to give him my real name so I just invented mine, you know, so I just invented mine, you know, in case we got involved in anything shady. Perhaps that's so, but you didn't invent it, Tuppence. Didn't I? No, you didn't. Thank you. No, I told it to you. Don't you remember? I said yesterday, I'd overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn. That's what put it into your mind. So you did, I remember now. Tommy. Yes? What were they like, the two men that passed you? Well, one was a big, dark, burly, sort of chap, quite handsome, I suppose. Do you know, I think that's him. How extraordinary, that's Whittington! And what was the other one like? Oh, well, I didn't really notice him particularly. It was really the outlandish name that caught my attention. [Tuppence giggles] And people say coincidences don't happen. Tuppence, what is this going to lead to? Who knows, might get another £50. Yes, well, if you insist on celebrating our new-found wealth in places like this, you'll have to. Were you hungry, or weren't you? Hungry. Well, then. But seriously, Tuppence, this man, Whittington, he was -angry, you say? -Very. Yes, and likely to be more so tomorrow. You can't bluff him forever, you know. You're sure to slip up, sooner or later. Where's your spirit of adventure gone? [door knocking] [door knocking] Oh, they're gone. Oh, they're gone. [Tuppence] Gone? [Tuppence] Gone? [Tuppence] Gone? Company being wound up, they say. Company being wound up, they say. Company being wound up, they say. Thank you. Thank you. I suppose you don't have Whittington's address? I'm afraid I don't, Miss, they left rather suddenly. Yes, they did, didn't they? Cheer up. Can't be helped. That's where you're wrong. This isn't the end, you know, it's just the beginning. This isn't the end, you know, it's just the beginning. It can't be the beginning of anything. It can't be the beginning of anything. -Have a bun. -I don't want a bun. Tommy, don't you see? If they're scared enough to run away, then there must be a lot in this Jane Finn business. Got a pencil? Oh, not again. We're going to get to the bottom of this, we'll be sleuths in earnest. There's no one left to sleuth. That's why we'll have to start all over again. Wanted, any information respecting Jane Finn. Jane Finn. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] Oh, it's the waiting I can't bear. Well, the advertisement only went in this morning. Sometimes, Thomas Beresford, you're irritatingly logical. Oh, look, what's that? What? There in the grass. Huh. Someone must've lost it. -Rather pretty, isn't it? -Yes, it is pretty. [Tommy] I suppose we ought to hand it in. [Tuppence] It's not worth anything. [Tommy] How can you tell? Cheap clasp. I'll take it as an omen that our luck's about to change. It had better, £5 won't last forever. -Tuppence. -Mm? [Tommy] Have you thought, supposing there are no replies? [Tuppence] To an advertisement in The Times? Don't be ridiculous. [crowd chattering] Sorry to disappoint you, old thing. -Good money wasted. -Oh, Tommy! Still, there it is. Only two replies. Oh, you devil! [laughing] Ooh, thick paper, this one. Looks rich. We'll leave it to last and open the other one first. Right you are. Dear Sir. Referring to your advertisement in this morning's paper, I may be able to be of some use to you. I may be able to be of some use to you. at the above address at 11 o'clock. at the above address at 11 o'clock. Yours, truly, A. Carter. 27 Carshalton Gardens. Plenty of time to get there if we go by taxi. Oh, it's from the Ritz. Dear, sir. R.e. your advertisement. I should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunchtime, Yours, truly, Julius P. Hersheimmer. Oh, I like the sound of Mr. Hersheimmer. Lunchtime frequently leads to free food. But first, Carshalton Gardens. [horn blares] What we want to know, Mr. Carter, is what do you know about Jane Finn? Well, no, the question is, what do you know about Jane Finn? I really don't see what that's got to do with it. Oh, but it has, you know, really. You must know something to have advertised as you did. So, suppose you tell me. We couldn't do that, could we, Tommy? I dare say the little we know won't be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you're welcome to it. But such as it is, you're welcome to it. Tommy. Tommy. [Carter] Do you know who I am? Recognised you at once, sir. I saw you in France when I was with the Intelligence. Fire ahead, Tuppence. I suppose it started really when Tommy and I bumped into each other... And when we got there, Whittington had vanished. So we advertised. Yes, I see. Well, you're a curious young couple, if you don't mind my saying so. Well, if it's adventure you want, how would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you understand. But expenses paid and moderate salary. What should we have to do? Go on with what you're doing now, find Jane Finn. Go on with what you're doing now, find Jane Finn. Yes, but who is Jane Finn? Yes, but who is Jane Finn? In the early days of 1915, In the early days of 1915, a secret treaty was drawn up in America, a secret treaty was drawn up in America, at that time, a neutral country. It was dispatched to England for certain signatures by a special messenger, young fellow called Danvers. by a special messenger, young fellow called Danvers. Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. [crowd screaming] He carried the precious papers in an oil skin packet which he wore next to his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk. And in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. Nobody actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might've done so. And when his body was eventually washed ashore and identified beyond any possible doubt, the oil skin package was missing. We think he entrusted the papers to her, believing that she, as a woman, would have a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore. But Jane Finn vanished. And the treaty? It seems that the treaty was not destroyed at all and has assumed a new and deadly significance. Its publication now would embarrass our government, strengthen the possibility of a general strike. General strike? Which would in turn lead to revolution in this country Which would in turn lead to revolution in this country and the danger of a war in Europe. and the danger of a war in Europe. [Tommy] Who in their right minds would ever- Well, we don't know that this man is in his right mind. He's spoken of quite simply as Mr. Brown. And do you think he has the treaty? We think he has knowledge of it. And if he got it, would certainly make use of it. And Jane Finn? May be dead for all we know. But I don't think so, because the curious thing is that they are now trying to get information about the girl from us. What ever for? Supreme power for himself of a kind unique in history. Supreme power for himself of a kind unique in history. There are no clues at all as to his real identity. There are no clues at all as to his real identity. Even his own followers are unaware of it. And his one idiosyncrasy, he never plays the principal part. But whenever we've come across his track, he's there, somewhere in the background. Maybe as a clerk or waiter or cabman. Once it was even a clergyman. And always the name is mentioned, Brown. In Whittington's office. The clerk, he was called Brown. Can you describe him? Just ordinary. You know, like everyone else. The invariable description of Mr. Brown, an unassuming sort of chap. But I must warn you both. You'll be pitting yourselves against a formidable organisation. business side? business side? Of it? Of it? Funds within reason, detailed information on any point, but no official recognition whatsoever. How much? Tuppence. Should we say at the rate of 300 a year? Each? Each. Oh, Tommy, pinch me, I can't believe it's real. Yes, we're not dreaming. We've got a job. And what a job! Oh, the joint venture has really begun! Funny how it makes you hungry. Everything seems to make you hungry. Well, it must be nearly lunchtime. Julius P. Hersheimmer. We didn't tell Mr. Carter about him. Well, there's nothing much to tell, not 'til we've seen him, but we'd better take a taxi. [laughs] Now who's being extravagant? [Tommy laughs] [car horn blares] [smooth violin music] Are you telling this Jane Finn is your cousin? [Herscheimmer] My father and her mother [Herscheimmer] My father and her mother [Tuppence] Then you know where she is? [Tuppence] Then you know where she is? [Herscheimmer] Darned if I do, don't you? [Tuppence] We advertised to receive information, Mr. Herscheimmer, not to give it. I know, I can read, but I thought maybe it was a bit of her past history you were interested in, you might know where she is right now. Are you telling me the truth? Oh, we really don't know where she is. Well, I know why I'm trying to find her, why are you trying to find her? Why are you trying to find her? When they were young, our parents were real close. They had a row, a big row. My Aunt Jane, that's Jane's mother, insisted on marrying the man she loved, except the man she loved was poor. In my experience, most men are. [laughs] Do you mind? No, no. Oh, thanks. My father was hopping mad. Said if he ever struck oil, he was speaking metaphorically, you understand, she wouldn't see a cent of it. Then he went and struck oil. Literally? Yeah, my daddy ended up the third richest man in America and last fall, he died and I got the dollars. So now you're the third richest man in America? I wanted to share my wealth with the only living relative I knew I had left in the world, cousin Jane. But when I went to track her down, I discovered she'd just vanished. That's why I'm trying to find her. Well, you see, we're kind of private investigators. Not kind of, we are! Who have been hired to try to find your cousin because it's thought that at the moment she disappeared, she had quite unknowingly got mixed up in some political show. She may be held somewhere against her will. Hm, that makes some sense. Whenever I've tried to start a line of inquiry, I've been turned away. Scotland Yard, they were civil enough. Even sent a man around this morning to pick up a photograph, quite an unassuming sort of chap. You don't happen to remember his name, do you? Yes, I do... No, no, I don't. I've got it here, though. Just half a sec. There it is. Inspector Brown. Are you sure? Quite sure? Well, I guess I must have been mistaken. Thank you, goodbye. Well, you're quite right Miss Tuppence, There is no Inspector Brown in Scotland Yard. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would anyone want to steal cousin Jane's photograph? Was there anything special about it? To me there was, as far as I know, is the only photograph of her in existence Now what do I do? We're going to have to tell him, it isn't fair. I agree. I'll tell him you, you book us in. When the government find that a little excessive. The government, wait a minute, what are you two? He said funds within reason. Yes, I'm not sure that within reason covers the Ritz. We're keeping in touch with Jane Finn's only living relatives. [upbeat music] Well, if you'll excuse me. Of course. I'll see you both later, I'm off to do a little sleuthing of my own. My colleague and I will confer, that's noon, that's to be ascertained and then we'll map out a plan of campaign. Oh good, good, make yourselves at home. Thank you Just like you to know, it's a real pleasure having you around. I didn't know nice millionaires existed. Money has charms. To begin with, what do we have to go on? Absolutely nothing. Wrong, we have two distinct clues. Have we? First clue, we know a member of the gang. Whittington? Whittington? I don't call that much of a clue. I don't call that much of a clue. Nevermind clue too is much more promising. It better be. Rita, a name Whittington mentioned. I know you're proposing a third investment, wanted female crook answers to the name of Rita. No, I am not, I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man Danvers was shattered on the way over it wasn't he? to have been by a woman named by a man. I don't see that at all. Well, its obvious, women and children first and that woman whoever she was, was saved. How do you make that out? Well if she wasn't, how would they've know that Jane Finn still had the papers. There's something about the simplicity of the truly great mind about you Tuppence. Thank you, now there's a chance, I admit it's only a chance that this woman may have been retired. And if so? We've got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania till we find her. We must have walked halfway round London these past few days and all we have to show for it is one freedom, four marriages and a couple of birthdays. I'm beginning to feel discouraged, I like things to happen quickly. You must die from this longing from focus and safety Tuppence. Mr. Brown is always reported to be, its a wonder he's not even known as to death, yet here we are unscathed. Perhaps he doesn't think it's worth bothering about. Well, I just have to show him, won't we? Who's next? Mrs. Vandemeyer Number 20 Right, Mrs. Vandemeyer here we come. Christian name? Marguerite, sir. M-A-R-G-A-R No, G-U-E. Marguerite, I see you're French. Actually on the old voting register, we had it as Rita Vandemeyer. She's mostly known as Rita but Marguerite is her real name, so she says. Thank you, thank you very much, goodbye. I know a thing, I feel the same. It's so lovely to think things really... [upbeat music] What the devil! Quick follow them, I dare he might recognise me. Who are they? I don't know who the fair one is, but the dark one, that's Whittington. [horse neighing] [upbeat music] You busy? What's your worth? I have a crime. Sorry cop but I have a delivery. [mumbles] come on in, jump up. Follow that hands carb. It ain't like that sunny. It ain't. Good guys bad guys good cops bad cops, it ain't that easy. Isn't it here miss? Say got dark hair and sous-vide skins and don't shave proper they're bad ones. Even the cops? Especially the cops miss. You sound like a bright young lad, will you? My name is Albert miss, hey what's happened to your voice? My voice? Which voice, I have so many voices. It was an American I mean it. The next minute am [murmurs] and in another minute am Russians. Because I get a bit confused. Its isn't the voice of the confusing Hebert. Albert. In all those disguises can you imagine what it's like in bed a completely different person from the person that got up in the morning. Are you a film Star or something? And you wish I were, know what this is? You shouldn't be telling me that. We know the people we can trust and we never forget a friend, knew what I'm after? One of the flats. Number 20, calls herself Vandemeyer. Who is she? Lady Rita they call her. Anne he always said she was a bad law. Anne he always said she was a bad law. House bother maid, she's leaving, House bother maid, she's leaving, a guillotine Abed said so Anne was reading her letters, all she thought it's so easy to get another. Yes, how would it be if you would say that you had a cousin or a friend of yours had my soup the place? You leave it to me miss, I'll fix the offing having two ticks . Oh, good lad, I'll see you tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock. In disguise. [speaking in foreign language] First off single to Bournemouth please. Just abandon. Just the one. Your train does not leave until 330, so we still have 20 minutes. Single Bournemouth please , third class, thanks. [Operator] Number please. Hypothec 8181 please. Hey Julius be there. Can I help you? Julius P. Hersheimmer please. You're British rap beats all description, which one's mine? That holdout chap carries now, here's your ticket, I can only afford third class I'm afraid. Go on man, run Nether of them? Mr. Beresford hasn't been seen since he left with you this morning. He might have riled or something open that will you please and Mr. Hersheimmer? Well, he had a phone call about 10 past three and then he just left. Oh, really is too mean of them, here am I busting with news not a single cell to tell it to. Men really are very unreasonable Harry. I am Jeremy Miss. [footsteps approaching] [upbeat music] [door knocks] Mr. Brown. [door bangs] [upbeat music] [door knocks] Well? Mr Brown. Second door on the left upstairs. [soft music] [footsteps approaching] Second door on the left, upstairs. [upbeat music] [footsteps approaching] Enter. Your number comrade. I am number one. We are honoured, greatly honoured, we thought it might be impossible for you to get here. One meeting was essential to define my policy so let us proceed. [door bangs] [soft music] Now, in the middle of a loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details satisfactory Boris? I think so. That is good and official denial from Moscow will be issued if necessary, and the date? The 29th. That is sooner than we planned. Information reached us from Mr. Brown that the government plans to change the law we had to move quickly. I understood there was a certain document in existence. That is so, if that document were placed before the labour leaders, the result would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast throughout England and declare for the revolution without a moment's hesitation. Government would broken finally and completely. Then what more do you want? The document itself. It is not in our possession. No. But you know where it is. Only one person perhaps and we're not sure if its them. Who? A girl. A girl? And you have a bit of speak. Where is this girl? She is. How did you get into this house? Better ask your watchdog. You let him in? He gave the password how was I to know? You deny you were listening at the door. Frightfully bad manners I know but your conversation was so interesting it overcame my scruples. Unfortunately, it was not a conversation intended for your ears, which is why I will now be put to death. Just a moment. I ask you, do I really look as though I thought there was the least chance of you're killing me? Now ask ourselves why I am so confident, gentlemen, because I know something that puts me in a position to propose a bargain. A bargain. My life and liberty against the papers that Dan has brought across from America and the Lusitania. Danvers I see you've got these papers, but you know what they are? No I do believe I know where to find them. And may also remind you of gentlemen, that your big day the 29th is less than a fortnight ahead. We accept on certain terms, the papers must be delivered to us before you go free. Don't be such an idiot, how can I search for them if you keep me locked up here? What do you expect then? I made two conditions, one I must have complete liberty to go about the business my own way and two I must question the girl. What girl? Jane Finn Of course. [laughing] I wonder my friend if you know as much [groans] See this door, we're right outside jut remember that. [groans] [soft music] Is the patient ready now nurse? Yes, certainly, I'll get her. Apart from the havoc that wreaked on the shrubbery, none of your own bones are broken, a slight spleen but there's nothing serious provided you put no weight on it. You mean I can't move? Precisely but don't worry you'll be up and about again a couple of days. I sure am sorry, Mr. Doctor, Dr. Hall, this is my nursing home. Julius P. Hersheimmer, glad to meet you, Doc. Well, I guess you might be a little curious as to what I was doing up that drain pipe. Well, it had occurred to me that the explanation might be a diversionary interest. I see doc, it was like this I met this girl, it's a very special girl you understand on the boat coming over. She talked to me too I can tell but her guardian didn't know he locked her in her cabin and gave me some guff about her being mentally disturbed and gave me some guff about her being mentally disturbed A fair diagnosis of anyone in love, wouldn't you see? A fair diagnosis of anyone in love, wouldn't you see? Anyway, I knew they were coming to Bournemouth so I decided to check out all the nursing homes in the area, climbed up a drain pipe to have a look in and believe it or not, I thought I saw someone I knew talking to one of your nurses. Mr Whittington I presume. That's the man. Mr Whittington has a niece and staff here he came to see her. Is he hanging around still? No, he went back to town almost immediately. Can I get address of his niece. No, she also left here tonight with a patient. I'm so sorry, I thought you were a friend of mine, breakfast at last. About little I'm about receiving the Lord magnitude, please don't go, don't get out yet. I just want to ask you something, are you Jane Finn? My name is Jeanette Finne. France? [speaking in foreign language] Not any length of time, I'm afraid, Annette have you heard that name before? I have two people mentioned it as you. Who mentioned it? I must go they will be waiting for me. [door bangs] Now that's what I call a disguise, best if I don't know you. Tricks of the trade Caspar tricks of the trade. Albert Miss. Albert, am I your cousin or am I not? [upbeat music] You may sit down. How did you hear I wanted a house parlormaid My cousin's a lift boy, he thought the place might suit me. You speak like an educated girl. I am an educated girl but it's difficult these days even for an educated girl to get a job. Your name? Prudence Cooper mam. You could come at once Prudence? Today if you'd like, I've got my references. Good, you wanna find this an easy place, two afternoons off a week Friday and Sunday. I should be out to lunch today Prudence but tonight I have a very special guest coming to dinner. She's new the girl. She came today. Sure she's safe? The whole party recommended her, something to guide. How do you know he was not bribed? How do you know he was not bribed? Why on earth should anybody want Why on earth should anybody want to bribe him, really Boris sometimes you are absurdly suspicious. [faintly speaking] You exaggerate. I do not exaggerate, Sir James Peele Edgerton is a celebrated liar, he distinguished politician. And a delightful companion. You are a very clever woman Rita but like many clever women, you are a fool where men are concerned, you must give him up. I think you have forgotten something Boris Ivanovitch. I take my orders from one man and one man only, Mr. Brown. And I will tell you what Mr. Brown would tell you that Peele Edgerton has studied crime as no other man in this country as candidly, he can smell a criminal, you've asked if you can deceive him. I do not need to deceive him, I'm a beautiful woman Boris, that is sir James only interest in me. Besides he's extremely rich. Money, that is always the danger with you Rita, money. I believe you would sell your soul for it. My soul, Boris have very whimsical of you. I believe you would even sell us. You're quite safe. It would take a much richer man than sir James to pay the price. to pay the price. Shall we going in to dinner? Shall we going in to dinner? Well, I suppose there's a kind of beauty in the all familiar things. Jeanette, Jeanette look at me, I want you to help me get out of this place. Would you help me, if you could? You have spied on them, they are quite right to keep you here. Wouldn't you do something to help another girl about your own age. You mean Jane Finn? It is her you came here to look for? Yes, always I hear that name, Jane Finn. Then you must know something about her. I know nothing, only the name. Nothing, not a word from either of them? No miss, I found a little fella liked you told me, [faintly speaking] Henry but he says there's still nothing. It's nearly two whole days, I would conceal it from you Wilbert. Albert. I'm worried and mind you do these tests were an absolute disgrace yesterday. Oh yeah, right, well, I'll begin miss, promise you. Good morning Mr. James? Good morning, Albert. Yes sir. You've been doing this sort of work a long I imagine, You've been doing this sort of work a long I imagine, nurse perhaps? nurse perhaps? Yes sir. Good place here what do you think? I hope so sir. But just remember there are always other good places and sometimes a change does no harm. But haven't I just started? Just a hit that's all, tell your mistress am here, will you? Yes sir. Dear Mr. Carter, I'm really worried, Tommy has disappeared I saw him two days ago when we saw Mr. Whittington and another man coming out. Just where have you been? I'll explain all that in a minute Miss Tuppence, those don't fools downstairs would have their Beresford hasn't been seen since Wednesday, is that true? Don't you know what he is? I have not one word with him since we split up the Depo. Depo? Waterloo. What on earth were the pair of you doing at Waterloo? Beresford who gave me a call said he was trailing two crooks. Boris and Whittington. Yeah the big one was mine the one you bluffed, Beresford shoved a ticket into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars, he said he was gonna sleuth the other one. You don't know anything at all about this? I knew like, Boris, whatever his name was, dined at Mrs.Vandemeyer last night. Mrs who? Rita Vandemeyer was on the Lusitania with your cousin Jane Finn, and she tried to befriend her, and I'm working her flat as a parlormaid. You mean you're a menial? I'm a special agent pretending to be a menial. Do you think this Boris is likely to come back to this flat again? Well I don't know, he might. Well, we'll just have to be ready for him. Look, I'm gonna buy a car, dress up as a chauffeur You don't think that might be trifle conspicuous? Well, it's just a chance we'll have to take. Oh, Miss Tuppence what kind of car would you like? [upbeat music] How did you do it? Well, you know your chance of the Exchequer? No personal no. Well, I went around to his house over there on Downing Street said I reckon this machine was worth every bit of $20,000 and I told him I give him $50,000 if he get out of it. And? He got out of it. Which is why of course he's a childhood of the exchequer. Well hop in I'd like to see the South oddly mansions of yours. Oh, no, I've been thinking, I think we should concentrate on Mrs. Vandemeyer other visitors, Sir James Peele Edgerton. Who the hell's he? A barrister, an MP expert at detection, in other words, professionals, even they seem scared of him. Well he spoke to me this morning, and I think he was trying to tell me something, to warn me. My dear young lady, as far as I recollect, I only mentioned that they were equally good situations to be found elsewhere. But it was a hint wasn't it? Perhaps, I certainly didn't expect you to turn up here only a few hours later miraculously transformed and cross questioning me about it. Sir James, I want to know why you gave me that hint. Well, if I had a young sister forced to unhealthy living, I should not like to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer service, that's all I can tell you. I see, thank you, thank you very much. For now perhaps you would tell me perhaps what is worrying you? Who is Tommy? He's Miss Tuppence childhood friend and what's really worrying us is. [humming] You've done extremely well so far, but it's rather too bad of what do you know as Carter? I think you said Mr. Carter's a pitchfork you went to an affair of this kind, we can only hope that your friend Tommy is still alive and we can find him. But how? Through Mrs. Vandemeyer, the one person who in all probability knows where he is. She would never tell us. I think I can promise you that she will tell me. We could try bribery, she likes money. Well, that's where I come in. I was wondering where you came in. Jane Finn is my cousin. And you can count on me if needed for $1 million. Mr. Hersheimmer that is a very large sum. Well, I don't think these are the kind of people you can offer six minutes to, do you? He's not pulling your legs Sir. James, he is disgustingly rich. So why don't we get down to it? What's your idea Sir. James? Miss, thank goodness you've turned up she's going. Who's going? and she just sent down word for me to get a taxi. You're a brick Albert, come on. There's a telephone here isn't there? In the flats mostly the Romans, but there's a box just around the corner. Go to it at once, call in the Ritz Hotel and ask for Mr. Hersheimmer Mr. Who? Hersheimmer and when you speak to him, ask him to tell Sir. James to come up once as Mrs. Vandemeyer is about to vacate, okay. [sighs] I've got to take mom, so I thought I better come home and have a quiet evening. You'd better go to bed. I'll be right in the kitchen. You little fool, do you think I don't know. [soft music] If you struggle or cry out I'll shoot, sit down. Put your hands above your head and if you value your life, Put your hands above your head and if you value your life, don't move them. don't move them. Now clever, I'll say that for you I had no suspicion at all but I think we know where we stand now, wouldn't you agree? What's that? Something to make you sleep. You're not going to poison me, are you? Perhaps and then again, perhaps not. Then I shan't drink it, I'd much rather be shot, I refuse to be killed off quietly. I refuse to be killed off quietly. Do you really think I were a human cry for murder adapt Do you really think I were a human cry for murder adapt to me, it's a sleeping draught that's all. to me, it's a sleeping draught that's all. Its poison, I know it's poison, Its poison, I know it's poison, please don't make me drink it. Stop snivelling you'll wake up tomorrow morning none the worse. Swear it. I swear it. Very well. I think we know where we stand now, wouldn't you agree? Supposing we sit down, our present attitude is ridiculously melodramatic, no, not on the bed, here we are, that's right. Splendid, now let's talk. What about? Money. Money? Always useful don't you think? Particularly when there's a lot of it. Do you think I'm the kind of woman to sell my friends? If the price was high enough. You couldn't buy me. I couldn't but I know a friend that could, shall we say 100,000 pounds, you can take it from me it's a perfectly genuine proposition. What does he want to know? This friend of yours. Where to find Jane Finn, you do know. Yes, I do know, what's that? Someone's listening. How could it be? You don't know him. Him who, Mr. Brown you mean? Him who, Mr. Brown you mean? Forget about Mr. Brown for a minute and think Forget about Mr. Brown for a minute and think about 100,000 pounds. He'll never let me get it, you don't know him, he is. Brandy, quickly. Its a heart attack I think. No, not there in the tantalous in the dining room, the second, don't bother I'll bring it myself. Mr. Hersheimmer would you open that window. Here, sir. James. Thank you. Miss Tuppence could you help me. Yes, yes of course. Drink it, it's only brandy I promise you. Its my heart, I mustn't talk. All we can do now is to let her rest. Okay, what happened Miss Tuppence? I just offered her 100,000 pounds to tell me where Jane Finn was when suddenly she seemed terrified. So she'd heard something but it was just you two. It's not the first time they've entrances I'm afraid but we got the message from young Albert, who was convinced you were in danger. He's right I was but how did you get in? Luckily the porter had master key. We're not going to get anything out of it till morning but I don't think we will to leave the flat. She wouldn't clear out for 100,000 pounds. She might, she seemed very frightened Mr. Brown. Miss Tuppence is right. You don't think you get after her between now and tomorrow morning, how would you even know? We have a very formidable adversary and Mr. Hersheimmer and we have an important witness, she must be safeguarded. Well, there's one thing I'd like to know, who put her up to clearing out? who put her up to clearing out? Mr. Brown I suppose, in another moment, Mr. Brown I suppose, in another moment, she would have told me who he was. A bit different from the rats in it. [upbeat music] Don't leave, sleepy, so tired, Mr. Brown. I shan't leave the flat, I'll sit up all night. [upbeat music] Take the key out please Miss Tuppence and lock the door. Do you have a pocket? Yes sir. James. Put the key in it then, there must be no chance of anyone entering that room. Leave him Jeanette. I just wanted one last look at him, you have tied him up so well. Jeanette. [speaking in foreign language] [upbeat music] Miss Tuppence are you all right? I'm sorry, he is here, somewhere in the flat. I know he is. But you yourself lock the door, the key is in your pocket there's no other way through to the other room. Mr. Brown is here, I could feel him. [groans] [door bangs] Jeanette. This way. [upbeat music] give me the key He has escaped, he has escaped. What's going on? Beresford Richmond he has escaped. [upbeat music] [speaking if foreign language] [groans] [gun pops] Good morning Mrs. Vandemeyer, I have brought you some tea. Julius would you open the other curtains please? Mrs. Vandemeyer, Mrs. Vandemeyer, she is dead. She must have been dead for some time. That's impossible, no one could have got in. She's on the point of betraying Mr. Brown when she dies is it under chance? But how? That is what we must find out, in the meantime when we send for a doctor, but before we do, is there anything in this room that might be of value to us? She kept her jewels and things in it. Keys in the lock. She was on the point of leaving remember, she should be burning some papers of some kind or another. Unfortunately, she seems to have made a thorough job of it. Anything? Nothing, its empty. [upbeat music] Empty. That's number one. Who is he sir? By many he is believed to be the real author of the Russian Revolution but he didn't arrive in this country till yesterday. He was at the meeting on Wednesday, I'd swear to it. Well, if he's part of Mr. Brown's organisation, anything's possible. Perhaps he is Mr. Brown. Unfortunately, one of the few facts of which we're certain is that Mr. Brown is no foreigner. A traitor, we've just fought a war. Which some people would prefer we haven't won. Now the 29th you say? Yes sir. That gives us just over a week. Well, we can deal with the general strike manners but if that draught treaty turns up we are done for, England we'll be plunged into anarchy. Dr. Hall I wonder if you could tell me, are you acquainted with Mrs. Vandemeyer? I know her slightly. I have reason to believe that Mrs. Vandemeyer once committed a young relative that Mrs. Vandemeyer once committed a young relative Janet Vandemeyer, her niece. Janet Vandemeyer, her niece. As far as I can remember, June or July of 1915. Was she a mental case? She was perfectly sane if that's what you mean. I understood from Mrs. Vandemeyer, that the girl had been with her on the Lusitania when that ill fated ship was sunk and she has been in a state of severe shock ever since. What kind of shock? Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory. What? She remembers nothing. Absolutely nothing. Or maybe seeing someone from back home might. I'm sorry, Mr. Hersheimmer I thought you understood, Mrs. Vandemeyer is no longer in my care. When did she leave? The same evening that you fell off my drain pipe, a very urgent message arrived from an aunt and the young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her lift by the night train. I remember now, you said nurse Edith left with the patient? My God we have been so near. Right, whereas I thought the birds have flown, a strip the house in Soho and gone. And only one thing puzzles me, when the mood changed when they tied me up, Conrad said something about bit different they tied me up, Conrad said something about bit different from the Ritz, but how could they have known? from the Ritz, but how could they have known? [engine roaring] Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm ever gonna find Jane? Of course you will find her. How long can you live on dreams? That's what I'm asking myself, I'd have a mind to go back That's what I'm asking myself, I'd have a mind to go back You can't, we've got to find Tommy. You can't, we've got to find Tommy. Well, I clearly forgot Tommy. [engine roaring] Miss Tuppence, do you mind if I asked a question? Far away. You and Beresford, what about it? Tommy and I, well were just good friends, that's all. Tommy and I, well were just good friends, that's all. But supposedly we never find him and. But supposedly we never find him and. And he's dead, it's alright said I can face facts, well. And all this business fizzles out, You could be kind of lonesome. Oh I'll be all right I intend to marry of course, if I can find anyone rich enough to make it worth my while. What kind of figures do you have in mind? Figure? You mean, tall or short? No, income. Oh, What about me? About you? I admire you immensely Miss Tuppence. Thank you very much I. I am proposing to you, will you be my wife? Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't. Because of Hersheimmer? No, it isn't that, well, thank you very much on that but I'm afraid I have to say no. I'd be obliged if you do me the favour to think about it until tomorrow. [engine roaring] An intriguing request. What are old friends for accept to help one another. Now, as you've helped me many times in the past. You're looking tired, Anthony. No, I've just had the Prime Minister on the phone. This are grave times, six months ago general strike would have seemed inconceivable. But not now, now its reality. So your problem, whatever it may be, may provide a little light relief, what is it you're trying to find out? Three weeks ago, a man's body was found near the docks in New York. [upbeat music] Took one for you miss. For me? Tommy, get me an ABC Henry. [soft music] Taxis waiting miss, what should I tell him? Charing Cross. [upbeat music] Excuse me, is Miss Cowley in her room? I'm sorry Sir, Miss Cowley has just gone out. Beresford, my God is it really you? Why on earth shouldn't it be? You've been given up for dead. Who thought I was dead? Miss Tuppence. Do you remember the proverb about the good dying young I suppose, yes well there must be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Shopping I suppose. Shopping I suppose. At lunchtime? That doesn't sound like Tuppence. I'd like to know where the hell you've been all this time. Look here, would you mind if we discussed it over lunch time, I am rather hungry. Lost her memory. That's what the man said. And that explains why they looked at me so oddly, when I spoke of questioning her. They didn't give you any sort of idea where Jane was. I'm an ass, I know, I ought to have got it out of them. Somehow, when I came round, all I could think about was the Cromenon wasn't there? Who's Cromenon? Mr. Carter says he's the man behind the Russian Revolution but I think Because Mr. Browns spokesman, not the mastermind himself, Moyes masters voice if you know what I mean. Excuse me sir, the young lady asked me to tell you that she's gone away. that she's gone away. Yes sir. Yes sir. She asked for a taxi, said Charing Cross, so I thought I mean when she asked for an ABC. When did you ask for an ABC? When I gave her the telegram sir. Telegram? Come at once, mode has every auction, great developments Tommy. You didn't send it? Of course I didn't send it. They've got her, damn they've got miss Tuppence. Then will just have to get her back, won't we? Beresford? Mmh I wasn't going to tell you this but considering what's happened, I think I should. This morning, I asked Miss Tuppence to marry me. I'd like you to know that before I suggested anything of the kind I made it quite clear that I in no way wanted to but in between the two of you. Tuppence and I are pals, that's all. The girl always refuses what she wants, doesn't she? You know sort of convention. Refuses, did you say refuses? Yeah, didn't I say that? Yeah, didn't I say that? Yeah, she is wrapped out of note Yeah, she is wrapped out of note without any reason to it, then she left me a note, I find out what I went upstairs to pack. What did you say in the note? Right here, I've got it right here see for yourself. Dear Julius, it's always best to have things in black and white, I don't feel I could be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Lets leave it till then, yours affectionately Tuppence. I thought I'd let you know that I had my own reasons for wanting to find her. Thank you. Julius, Henry said Tuppence told the taxi drivers to take her to Charing Cross. Well? Trains for Yorkshire leave from Kings Cross. [engine roaring] I don't think Miss Tuppence has ever been near this place. She must have been, this is the motor house and maybe a caretaker or something. Caretaker, you gotta be kidding, look around you, who has been taking care of this place? Look at that dust, that's pretty thick, Let's have a look around. [upbeat music] It's Tuppence's Are you sure? Absolutely, we found it together in the park. Well, that settles it, she came here anyway someone must have seen her, We will raise hell around here till we find her. Do you realise we've been here for two whole days? We are not nearer to finding her, the next Sunday is the 29th, if we're gonna get her back, I've got to do it before then. Her life wouldn't be worth anything afterwards. We need help, professional help. I'm gonna do what we should have done when we first found the pouch, go to Scotland yard. What about Sir James? What about him? You said, Tuppence trusted him. I didn't say I did. [upbeat music] Where did you get this clothes? Where did you find them? Let me handle this Beresford [murmurs], its okay honey, we just wanna know where you found the clothes, that all. we just wanna know where you found the clothes, that all. Over there, by the rocks, Over there, by the rocks, the sea brought them in, they were wet and sandy. Didn't think they belong to anyone? Was there anything else? Are you sure, No one's gonna be angry with you. There was something in this pocket. There was compact. The treaty. Have you a knife Tommy? Yes. With the compliments of Mr. Brown. [James] Beresford, you and I have never met, but I've heard a great deal about you. I've just learned from my friend Carter the tragic news of miss Cowley's death, I will not try to comfort you with platitudes, she was an unforgettable young woman and she will not be forgotten. Time will heal, but possibly a change of scene might help it heal more quickly. I have business interests in Arizona. Arizona? which needs a good man who might take over as a manager. If you are interested come to see me, James Peele Edgerton. Dear Sir James, thank you for your letter. I appreciate the thought that went behind it, but I'm afraid I must stay here until I find. [door knocks] Julius, look here so have I'm sure I have. Julius? Oh damn. [upbeat music] It was a photograph of Jeanette, the girl who saved my life. Young man, take my advice let others fight this secret battle, its bad enough that one young life would have been lost unforgivable if they were two. Accept my offer, go to Arizona concentrate on your own future, let those of us like Katherine myself, whose lives are more than half over worrying about the countries. Don't think I'm not grateful Sir but I must find out what happened to Tuppence. If she is what they said is true, then that's something that has to be avenged. What about the telegram? Telegram? The guard said she received the telegram, the one that lured her away? I don't understand. It's just possible that the telegram that you read was not the telegram was sent. Perhaps that's why Henry said Tuppence told Perhaps that's why Henry said Tuppence told to Charing Cross when logically she should to Charing Cross when logically she should have said Kings Cross, come on check something like that. Some men have more power outside the cabinet than within. Probably not the next days or the price but he was the one that brought a message with Miss Kelly and she hasn't been back and is no one in that way is flat and he is worried. We're leaving Henry. This is why you should. Thanks. [James] Come at once, ask the me priors gatehouse Kent great developments Tommy, good luck, James Peele Edgerton. Come in, hello. Albert sir. Albert, you knew Miss Kelly? He was gonna recruit me sir. Recruit? For the Secret Service sir. The crooks haven't gone, have they sir? I'm afraid they have Albert. In the underworld? They dash it all in this world, now then I need a good man to rely on, do you think you could invent a sick grandmother or something and get a couple of days off? Excellent now Henry, I'm gonna write a couple of letters, but I don't want them delivered until Albert and I are safely out of the way. Yeah I am your man sir. [Beresford] Dear Hersheimmer, I've tried telephoning but you were out, something extra ordinary has happened. something extra ordinary has happened. and in the present circumstances I've decided to take it. and in the present circumstances I've decided to take it. I leave immediately, goodbye, Tommy Beresford. Damn fool. Oh yes about that party in New York I couldn't get much I am afraid right, on top of about 35 poorly dressed face very badly disfigured, of about 35 poorly dressed face very badly disfigured, still hasn't been identified. still hasn't been identified. I could identify him, I can't prove it yet, but I could identify him. but I could identify him. You're a devious animal, You're a devious animal, sometimes I wonder why we get on so well. Old School friendships never die. True as I've always wanted if anyone was to run the elusive Mr. Brown down, it would be you. And you my friend will be the first to know I promise you, goodbye. Goodbye. This arrived for you by hat. Thanks a lot. that's given me a jar, I think I know where the real Jane Finn is and what's more, I've figured it out that Tuppence is no more drown than I am. I'm going to try to find her, I've even got an idea where the papers are, the last Sunday I guess and I may be making an awful ass of myself. But anyway, I enclose it in a sealed envelope for what it's worth. I'm going to ask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on the 28th. They're desperate to get hold of the treaty you see and if they thought that the papers have been recovered by us, Tuppences life wouldn't be worth an hour's purchase. One last thing, please have that house in Soho watched day and night. in Soho watched day and night. Yours, Thomas Beresford. Yours, Thomas Beresford. [upbeat music] Looks very quiet sir. Yes, too quiet. I still have to draw the enemies far, you stay here, just watch. Wish me luck. Good luck sir. [faintly singing] Now go back to whichever [mumbles] was you've just crawled out of. The moment I was running you off, somebody open the window and check this out was that random paperweight yet. Tomorrow same time. Albert did you see who threw it? I couldn't tell who it was scarf, anyway selling old to me because I replied. You did what? Well I scribbled a message wrapped it around a paperweight and tracked it back through the window. What does it say this message of yours? That day, whoever it was, could find it zeroed in. Your zeal Albert could be the undoing of us. [soft music] [faintly speaking] Take this to the gentleman at the end he will give you 10 shillings. Dear Tommy, I knew it was you last night, they're taking us away this morning, I heard something about Wales Holyhead I think I'll drop this on the road if I get a chance yours, Tuppence. this on the road if I get a chance yours, Tuppence. What about my 10 shillings? What about my 10 shillings? Here's a bob, it was a very short note. Thanks very much sir. Anything the matter sir? How do you spell Tuppence, Albert? T-U-P-P-E-N-C-E Yes, it's actually spotted, now look at this. T-W-O-P-E-N, that's not right, is it sir? Someone made a mistake and I know who. This is an outrage, do you mean to kill me? You didn't worry chromatin I'm not proposing to kill you yet, if you're reasonable that is. What do you want, money? No, I don't, I want Jane Finn. I have never heard of this, Jane Finn. You'll tell me now and I mean now where I can find her. I dare not, you ask an impossibility. I dare not, you ask an impossibility. Afraid, of whom? Afraid, of whom? Mr. Brown? He would kill me. Glad to hear it because that makes two of us. I'm gonna count to five if you let me get past four, you won't need to worry too much about Mr. Brown. One, two, three, four. I will do as you wish. Where is she? At the gate house, in camp. [engine roaring] Now listen to me, I'm gonna tell you just exactly what I want you to do, you're gonna drive straight up to the house and you're gonna ask for the girls. I never have. Now listen, you're gonna ask for the girls and you sure as hell better make it good. Now relax, I'll tell you a story about a man I shot once in Alaska. What are you doing here? Bring down the girls at once, there is no time to lose. Surely you know the plan. The plan has been changed, we have been betrayed, the girls at once because that's the only chance. You have orders from him. Should I be here otherwise? Hurry. Come on move, move. Hold right there. Julius. Take it away Miss Tuppence, move over calmly. Hold it, [gun fires] I said hold it. [engine roaring] Don't let them get away [gun fires] Are you all right Miss Tuppence? Of course I am, where's Tommy and who's this? Tommy's on his way to Arizona. Doing what? Tommy thought you turned up your toes. [gun fires] Lean in everyone. It's your covenant, I persuaded him to come on this trip for the sake of his house. They know I have betrayed them, my life won't be safe an hour on this country. my life won't be safe an hour on this country. for Russia and fast, pull up miss Tuppence. for Russia and fast, pull up miss Tuppence. [upbeat music] Stop, stop. Jeanette are you all right? Jeanette, is that what you call her? Its her name isn't it? This is a real original James Finn you're looking at. [tyres screeching] [upbeat music] [gun fires] Let me out its me they are after, let me out and you will be safe. I guess there's nothing wrong with your memory is there? Been fooling them all this time. Well you listen to me, cousin Jane, I've come all the way over here to here to try and find you and sure as hell I'm not going back without you. [upbeat music] Is it left or right Julius? Right, Sorry. Tommy. Hello. Hello. Where the hell have you come from Beresford? Where the hell have you come from Beresford? I was in the bushes by the drive, hung on behind, couldn't let you before the pace you were going, rocking shots, a lot of them. Now then you girls, get out. Out? There was a station just up that road. You don't think you can fool them by leaving the car. You don't think you can fool them by leaving the car. You are out of your mind, You are out of your mind, you can't let the girls go off alone. Take her with you and do just as I say, take the train to London, go straight to Sir James Peele Edgerton, you'll be safe with him. You're crazy, Jane stay where you are. Get out both of you or I'll shoot. Come on it's all right, if Tommy sure he is sure. What the hell? Dry up Hersheimmer, I want a few words with you. At first, well I had no suspicions but on the boat to Hollywood I began to get frightened, this woman, Mrs. Vandemeyer. Rita. She tried to make friends with me, but there was something about her I just didn't trust and she'd been near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the papers. I ripped open the oil scan packet, took out the treaty, there were only two pages of it and slipped it between the pages of a magazine [upbeat music] And in the end, I found myself in the same railway carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. [upbeat music] After a few moments, I began to feel uneasy so I decided to leave the carriage. As I tried to get out, I felt a terrific blow on the back of my head. When I came to I was lying on a bed in a dirty squalid room with no windows and I could hear two people talking, one of them was Mrs. Vandemeyer. They hadn't found the papers yet and were speaking of torturing me until they found out where they were. Suddenly, something put the thought of loss of memory into my head, I opened my eyes and started babbling in French. [speaking in foreign language] Mrs. Vandemeyer called to the man she has been speaking to, spoke to me in French, he asked my name and I didn't know that I couldn't remember anything at all. and I didn't know that I couldn't remember anything at all. Suddenly he took hold of my wrist and began twisting it, Suddenly he took hold of my wrist and began twisting it, I don't know how long I could have gone on but luckily I fainted. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me, she told me I'd been in shock and was very ill I saw my coat lying on a chair I saw my coat lying on a chair the magazine was still rolled up in the pocket. the magazine was still rolled up in the pocket. I got up as softly as I could, very gently I took hold of one of the pictures in the room. One of Marguerite with her casket of jewels, the back of the picture was quite loose. I took the treaty out of the magazine and slipped it between the picture and it's back end. [soft music] Then the paper are still in the back of that picture, We must get that at once. Tonight? Tomorrow may be too late, besides by going tonight we have the charts of capturing Mr. Brown I'm sure it is his plan that we have laid him and he imagines the risk is not great since he will enter in the guise of a friend. You knew who Mr. Brown is, don't you? I've been certain for some time, ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer's mysterious death, there we were up against the logical facts, either she took the chloral herself or else. Yes. It was administered in the brandy you gave her, only three people touched that brandy. You Miss. Tuppence, I myself and one other. Julius, what are you saying? That Julius is Mr. Brown? Julius my cousin? Not your cousin, the man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relative of yours. I don't believe you. Or the real Julius set out to look for you that much is true but three weeks ago, his body was found in New York. Sharply dressed, the face disfigured to prevent identification. Julius Hersheimmer ceased to exist, Mr. Brown took his place. [upbeat music] Upstairs. No one has come into the house so far the police are quite sure of that, anyone who attempts to enter after us will be arrested straight away. I've got it, at last. We've succeeded It was in this room that our young friend was confined for long, is it not? The Truth is in this room, you'll notice the absence of windows and the thickness of the close fitting door, whatever took place in here will never be heard by the outside world. You've sensed danger Miss Tuppence, so does miss. Finn. You feel, as we all feel the presence of Mr. Brown. In this house. In this room. You? That's right miss Tuppence, I am Mr. Brown. Who said just now we had succeeded? I have succeeded, the draught treaty is mine and in two days time this country will be mine. But that's madness. Absolute power, is that so mad to dream? Many men have had that dream, I shall be the first to realise it. You will never get away with it. People trust me my dear, you did, your friend Tommy did, the only one who didn't was the American and he will soon be dealt with. And us? Neither of you will leave this room alive. Should I tell you how it will be? Sooner or later the police will break in and they will find three victims of Mr. Brown. Three, not two you understand? Fortunately the third will not be dead only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack in a wealth of detail. The treaty of course is in the hands of the assassin Mr. Brown. Once you outwitted me, you will not do it again. [screams] [gun fires] You. [speaking in foreign language] [upbeat music] [speaking faintly] Beresford, Beresford, please tell me when did you first cast me as the villain? Oh, well, like you, I suppose I realised that Mrs. Vandemeer hadn't committed suicide, only two people could have killed her. One was Sir. James pillar of the establishment seemingly totally above suspicion and you. About whom we knew very little. Thank you. Well, we knew he was the third richest man in America. [laughs] We knew he claimed to be, sorry Julius, then I found that a photograph of Jeanette in the drawer and realise she had to be Jane Finn, even if you didn't note yourself. But you said that that photograph had been taken from you by inspector Brown. Well, I was telling you the truth it had. Then how did you get it back again? Believe it or not, I found it. In the safe in Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom? Right. I knew you were lying when you said you'd found nothing. The one thing that always puzzled me was how they linked me with the Ritz. Now, as far as I was aware, only three knew, Tuppence, Julius and Mr. Carter, it wasn't until after I got free that I discovered one other person knew, Sir. James and that it was immediately after he'd been told that I was ordered to be killed. I couldn't quite make a decision, Sir. James or Julius? Well, I had one big advantage over you, I knew it wasn't me. [laughing] Yes, well, I kept an open mind, I left that note about Arizona for you so you'd think you had a clear field, then went see Sir. James and told him everything I knew. then went see Sir. James and told him everything I knew. Everything? Everything? Except where I thought the treaty was. But when did you know it wasn't Julius? When I got the bogus note it was printed, not handwritten, but it was really the signature that gave it away, Tuppence. Good thinking Tommy. Well, it's the right way to spell it, isn't it? T-W-O-P-E-N-C-E, but only someone who had never seen your signature would have spelled it like that. would have spelled it like that. Julius had seen it, you wrote him a note once. Julius had seen it, you wrote him a note once. How do you know about that? Oh, there's quite a lot I know that you don't know I know. If you knew it wasn't Julius, why did you hold him up at gunpoint? I knew that unless Sir. James was actually caught in the act so to speak, Mr. Carter would never believe I'd have him on my word alone. Yes, to my eternal shame, you're right. The girls had to lead Sir. James to that house and the Marguerite picture, on the way up I told Julius the whole story. The Bears would have said that I would never have believed Sir James Peele Edgerton would be guilty, unless he was caught in the act. Well, he was an old friend, a close friend but I didn't know that he was also a madman and in this diary of his where all the details of the coup, the courage of you young people has reverted to be no general strike now, no revolution. The country came perilously near it. So I'll give you a toast, the joint venture, which has so amply justified itself, by success. [Everyone] Joint venture. Thank you. Thank you. That was fun wasn't it? Rather. I like Julius. You're not to marry him, do you hear? I forbid it, absolutely, do you understand? He doesn't want to marry me, he rarely only ask me out of kindness. Oh really? It's quite true, he's head over heels in love with Jane. I expect he's proposing to her now. They'll do for each other very nicely. Don't you think she's the loveliest creative ever seen? I dare say. But I dare say you prefer sterling worth. Don't you tell Tuppence you know. By the way, what will you do now? an allowance will you accept Carter's offer? Or Julius's invitation to work in America? I shall stick to the old ship I think but it's awfully good of Hersheimmer, besides I feel it'd be more at home in London. I didn't see where I come into it. I do. [upbeat music] Oh Tuppence. [faintly speaking] [upbeat music]
