[gasping] [sobbing] Oh, my God. [gasping] [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [gasping] [sobbing] [panting] No, no, no. [sobbing] No. No, no, no. Please. no. Please, I won't say anything. I won't say anything. No, no. No! [screams] [bird chirping] It's been a long time. Please, you'll have them eating out of your hand in no time. It's been six years since my last listing appointment. I just hope I can get back on that horse. We were a good team then, we'll be an even better team now. Okay? Okay. Let's go. [sighs] This would be a great listing. Will be. -Always this confident? -As you once told me, it's practically a job requirement. So come on, Stella. It's time to get your groove back. Hello, you're right on time. It's a good start. It's great to see you again, Victoria. This is my partner, Christine March. -Nice to meet you. -[Victoria] Come on in. Thanks. This is an incredible home. You know, it reminds me of that Adison house. -Right. -Amanda and I have the prefect marketing strategy on how to sell this property. We'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand in no time. Well, we haven't decided on who to list with yet. No, of course. You know, this does remind me of that Adison home. Didn't we end up selling that over asking? -Yeah, in, what, three days? -Right. Wow, um, in that case, let me show you the kitchen. -[Amanda chuckles] -[Eric] Congratulations. Let's hope this is the first of many new listings. You should've seen her, Christine was fantastic. They couldn't sign the papers fast enough. I am not surprised. I was a little rusty in the beginning. But once we got rolling, it felt pretty good. [chuckles] And it's gonna feel even better when we sell it. -And cash our commission checks. -Hear hear. -[mobile phone ringing] -Oh. This is another seller I'm trying to get an appointment with. Wish me luck. [Christine chuckles] -[Amanda] Hi, Amanda here. -So... seems like things may be working out for you. Fingers crossed. -It's been rough, huh? -Yeah. But it's gonna be better when the divorce is finalized next month. I am more than ready to move on. [chuckles] And how's Oliver holding up? He doing okay? It's hard on him, you know? He's so young. He doesn't understand why his mom and dad split up. -'Cause his dad's a jerk. -[chuckles] I'm sorry, it's just... it's one person's opinion. Yeah. Olly will be okay, just... it's just gonna take some time. Yeah, he will be okay. He's a lucky kid and he's got an incredibly mother. Oh, thanks. [Christine] Olly, I'm home! Olly? Olly! Olly? Oliver? Oliver! Oliver? [door shuts] [yells] Got ya! [laughs] How funny is it gonna be when you give your mother a heart attack? Don't worry, I know CPR. I don't like it. [laughs] Which is why it's always fun. Where were you? I looked everywhere for you. On the stables, wishing I could get a horse. Dad promised me. -He said for my next birthday. -Well, we can't this year, okay? Yeah, it's because of the stupid divorce. -[sighs] -Look, I know it's not easy right now, okay? But I promise you it's gonna get better. Like, you and dad getting back together? [groans] -No. Not like that. [chuckles] -Really? But, Mom got a new job, so we might have some extra money coming in to do a lot of fun things. Enough for a horse? We'll see. Horses are very expensive. But you and Dad promised. You know what for? I know, I know. Just give me a little time, okay? It's kinda weird. Being here without Dad. I know. [sighs] Honestly, it's a little weird for me too. -Yeah. -Oh. [chuckles] -[chuckles] Such a boy. -There you go. [yells] -Wait, help your mom! -[Oliver grunting] [grunting] Here you go. [yells] Here you go. [knock at door] -[door opens] -Knock, knock, anybody home? -Dad! -Hey, buddy. Surprise. [chuckling] Wow! I thought we talked about you not just walking in here. Well, I didn't. I knocked, just like you asked. -[Jason sighs] -Dad, you want some dinner? Mom made barbecued chicken. [Jason] Oh, I love Mom's barbecued chicken! But I think I can't stay. I brought you something instead though. -Can I open it? -Go for it. [Oliver] This is awesome! You know, technically, it's my house, still, too. It is, technically, until next month. I just spoke with a realtor and I think, um, -now is a good time to sell it. -Jason, stop. We're not gonna talk about this again. All right? I'm not uprooting him. Couldn't have changed this year. Do you really... think you can afford this house by yourself? Yeah, I do. I'm gonna do whatever it takes. I started working again, that's going really well and I'm gonna rent out the guest house, that'll help pay for half the mortgage. Look, don't even worry about it. It's my decision, it's my problem to have. I just think you're making an emotional decision, rather than a rational one. [Oliver] This is awesome! A remote-control helicopter! -Dad, come on, fly it with me! -[Jason] Let's do it! Look, I don't mean to be so critical. [Christine] You never do. I've made some mistakes. Mistakes? Really? -You had an affair for a year. -Which has been over for months. How many times am I gonna have to apologize for that? I mean, if I could go back in time, I would, but I can't. Let's just move on. That's exactly what I'm doing, Jason. Without you, okay? [knocking] He's waiting. I know. Hi, it's Christine March from Home Source. How are you? Yeah, I was hoping to schedule a viewing of that property on Summer Ridge. Uh-huh. All right. Wednesday at two. That's perfect. Okay. Bye-bye. -[phone beeps] -[dog whimpers] [chuckles] [dog whimpers] [whimpering continues] No, that's not for you. Hey, come here, buddy. What're you doing, Brando? Sorry about that. That's all right. He's a sweetheart. Yeah, he's a stubborn sweetheart. He's really good at listening to nothing I say, but I'm dog sitting for a friend of mine this weekend, -so... -Oh, that's nice. Oh, yeah. I love him. He's such a good boy. He's a really good boy. Mom, did you see how many times I bounced it? I did and you were great. Nick was showing me how to do it. Yeah, but let me tell you, you got some real natural instincts there, Oliver. Hey, you want some lunch? Mom made ham and peanut butter sandwiches. Ham and peanut butter? Either-or, not together. Yeah, that would be gross together. Are you hungry? Uh, sure. Yeah, I mean, if you've got more. Sure, I have plenty. And I bet you I have something for that guy. [Nick] Yeah, I wanted to have kids too someday. But I found out that my ex, Sherry, my ex-girlfriend, she was dating someone else the entire time we were dating. So that didn't work out. -That's awful. -Yeah. Uh, because you feel so stupid. It's like, how could I not... Yeah, I know what you mean. Uh-oh. That's the voice of experience speaking. My husband, soon to be ex-husband... um, not getting into it, it's... a similar story. And I was completely kept in the dark. It's, uh... -heartbreaking. -Mm-hmm. Right. It's just like, how do they do that? But, you know, at a certain point you just let it go, right? I mean, what can you do? Let it go. -Easier said than done. -Sometimes. Worst part about it for me is the apartment. -The worst part? -I love that apartment. Now I have to move because it's under her name. Did you find a place yet? Uh, no. No. Well, this just happened, so... Let's talk about something else. -That's a good idea. -[Oliver] Hey, Nick. -Hey. -Hey, Nick. You wanna throw a football with me for a minute? Let me see that. This is an awesome football, yeah, I do. -[Oliver] Yeah. Let's do it. -It was nice to meet you. -Nick. -Christine. -[chuckles] -Let's go, man. -Yeah. Come on, Nick. -All right. [engine sputtering] -Ugh! -[sighs] The car won't start. Really? Really? You think? Mm. Don't you worry now, because this woman right here will figure it all out. I've got it covered. I know how to... -fix this. -[engine sputtering] Oh, like you can fix a car. -I am supermom, Yes, I-- -[Nick] Hey. Oh, hey! [chuckles] You have some trouble? You need help? Yes. My car won't start. [chuckles] Pop up the hood. I work with cars for a living, you're in luck. Thank you. Hey, I have, um, something I wanna talk to you about. [Oliver] Yeah? What do you think about us asking Nick to look at our guest house? Because he's looking for a place and... -That would be awesome. -It would? -Give it a try. -Oh. -Sorry to scare you. -Yeah, it's okay. -Sorry. [chuckles] -[engine starting] Ah. -Eureka! -[chuckles] Well, it was just a loose cable on your battery, don't know how it happened. -Thank you. -It's magic. I did nothing. You're a lifesaver, you did a lot. -Thank you. -No problem. Drive safely. -See you, Oliver. -Hey, Nick, um, Olly and I were just talking... Well, we're gonna rent out our guest house and you're looking for a place, do you wanna come by and see it? Yeah. Uh, yeah. I mean, I'd like to take a look at it. It's really nice. I think it is, I mean. -I'm sure it is. -All right. Well, let me give you our number. Okay. Yeah. More soccer practice for you, right, Oliver? -There you go. -Okay. -Thanks. [chuckles] -You're welcome. -Bye. -Bye. Good-looking as in pleasant, or good-looking as in hot? -Pretty hot. [chuckles] -Single? Apparently so. And he's gonna be living right out back. I-- Yeah, I don't know, I don't know. He's gonna come by and see it tomorrow. He gave me his landlord's information and... We'll see, he seems pretty excited. Does he have a job? Yeah, I guess he refurbishes old cars or something. Okay, so let me get this straight, there's gonna be a hot, single guy living right out back. Jason is gonna have a total conniption fit. -I hadn't even thought about it. -Oh, right. Sure. -Cheers. -[squeals] [indistinct chatter on TV] [dog barking] [barking continues] Hey! -Hi. -Oh, you made it. Yeah, easy to find. Yeah? Directions were all right? -This is great. -Oh, thank you. -I get-- How are you? [chuckles] -Oh, hi. Hey. -Come on in. Let me show you. -Sure. Can't wait. So, through here is the stables and then around the back is the guest house. -Stables? -Yeah. Yeah, there's no horses, unfortunately, but... it's still beautiful. We had great intentions of putting horses back here. -[chuckles] -This is fantastic. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah, this is definitely where the mud wrestling takes place. [Nick chuckling] So this is the tennis court. -Wow. -Yeah. -Little judging panel there. -Mm-hmm. So this is it. This is Jason's old home-office. Hope you like the furniture. This, um, pulls out to be a bed. And it's right in front of the TV, just how I like it. -It's really private out here. -It's perfect. -I'll take it. -Really? Yeah, I mean, if you'll have me, I'll take it. Absolutely. I talked to your landlord today, actually. He said you're a really great tenant. Oh. Sorry, I just... I feel like things are really looking up for me now. I'm glad I met you. Yeah, me too. Me too. We're gonna have to tell Oliver. He's got a new playmate. This is amazing. I mean, you never have to go anywhere. You have everything you need right here. Well, you're welcome to use the pool and the courts, -if you want. -Oh, yeah. Do you play? Um, yeah. Little bit. Started a few years ago, once I got Oliver off to school, you know, I needed something to do, so... I thought you said you were a real-estate agent? I am. Um, and I was before, but my husband, he-- Soon to be ex-husband. Right. Is this him? Yeah. He, uh, didn't want me to work, so I quit. So you just did what he told you to do? More often than I should have. Yeah. He's an attorney, he argues for a living. I mean, you seem like such a strong woman, it's hard for me to imagine anybody telling you what to do. Well, I promise, uh, I'll never let that happen again. Good. [yelling] [yelling] [Nick laughing] Ready, and dive! Oliver, let's go, let's go, let's go. Your dad's gonna be here any minute. Sorry, Jason's late. Do you hear me complaining? Beautiful day. -Gorgeous view. -[Nick] Hey. -Stop. -What? Nick, a little help, please. It's like I have two kids. One of them is seriously hot. -[grunting] -[grunting] -That's it. -[grunting] Hi. Amanda and I have to go to work. Bye. -[Jason] Hey. -What are you doing? I know how much you've been worried about Oliver, I got him something that's gonna make him feel much better. Oh my gosh! [Jason] He's gonna flip. You can't just bring a horse here without asking me. [Jason] Look, we talked about getting it for him before we got separated and now that you're gonna be staying here, what's the big deal? -This is awesome! -[Jason] He's a beauty, huh? I'm gonna get you lessons too. -[Oliver] I like you. -We didn't talk about this. Oh, don't worry. Listen, I'm gonna pay for everything. I'll pay for the food and all the upkeep. [Christine] That's not the point. Dad, when can we take lessons? Yeah, as soon as we find somebody. I could teach him. I used to ride when I was a kid. -Yeah, sure. -Who are you? This is Nick. He lives here. Oh. Out back. I'm sorry, Nick. This is Jason. Oh, the ex. Hey, man. How are you? -Nice to meet you. -[Oliver] Mom, can we keep him? Please? [sighs] You know what, why don't you go show the man where the stables are, okay? -Yeah! -Let's go. -So who is this guy? -I told you I was renting out the guest house. To him? What is this supposed to mean? It supposed to piss me off? Make me feel jealous or something? Believe it or not, Jason, this has absolutely nothing to do with you. Are you sleeping with him? Go to hell. -Come on, Christine. -You know what, Amanda and I have a listing appointment. So you do me a favor, make sure your son has his backpack for school tomorrow. -[jazz music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[Eric chuckles] Yeah, right. -All right. Okay, okay. [indistinct chatter] -Tell that story. -[woman laughing] I've heard of things like that before. -[man 1] Tell the story. -[man 2] Tell the story! All right, so I'm showing this house in the hills, with my clients, this very, very uptight couple from Connecticut, okay? Of course. So anyway, we drive up, knock on the door, no answer, but the house is vacant, you know, the door's open, so we go right in, I start showing the house. [all laughing] Anyway, the showing's going great, they're loving the house, go down to the kitchen, I open the kitchen door, and right there is the listing agent, standing there with his pants around his ankles. -[Amanda] Oh my God. -[man laughing] And the client on the counter. -[Yvonne] Oh, my God. -Well, the worst part is, they didn't see us so they didn't stop. Then they stopped. And the guy turns around and he goes, "Oh, welcome. Great to see you -I got a price reduction." -[all laughing] -Oh, I told you it's a classic. -[Christine chuckles] Oh, I gotta go. -What? No. Come on. -[Amanda] No! You can't leave us. Oliver's with his dad, right? -Yeah, I know but-- -You can stay out late with the grownups tonight. This grownup can't party like she used to. -Boo. -[Christine chuckles] I can't believe you remember that story. -We go way back, right? -We do. Thank you for the drink. [chuckles] -Bye, guys. -Bye. [indistinct chatter] [door opens] [gasping] [gasping continues] [whispers] Nick. -Nick, somebody broke in. -What? Yeah, they went through the front door. Wait, front door? Come inside, close the doors. I don't see anyone. I know they were in here. -You didn't see who it was? -No. -What if they saw me? -It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. You're okay, okay? Come on. Lock the door. [sighs] Come here, come here. [kisses] [Christine] So is every window and door covered? Yes, Ma'am. It's directly wired to our dispatch center. Okay. All you have to do is enter your code here and then press the "arm" button. -All right, uh. -[machine beeping] -Like that? -Yeah, just like that. If you have another incident like last night press these two keys together and it triggers the alarm. Right. Should've done this a long time ago. Can't be too safe. She didn't waste any time, did she? Christine and Jason have been separated for over five months. She's overdue to have a little fun. So Jason was cheating on her? He said it was just once, that it didn't mean anything. But then Chris found out it'd been going on for months. Bastard. I hope she's making him pay for it. I said that too, but she just cares about custody of Oliver, she said she doesn't really want the money. Give it to me, I'll take it. [chuckles] I think that Jason's finally realized what a mistake he's made. Good. And good for her for finding a handsome new boy toy. [Eric] Who's that? Christine? He's not a boy toy, he's a tenant. He's renting the guest house out back. [Yvonne] Wonder how he's paying the rent. You are terrible. Not that I blame her. [chuckles] So who is this guy? How does she know him? Careful, Eric. You're starting to sound a little bit like Jason. Wow! -You're gonna give me a haircut. -Wow! Wow! Let it come down slow. Slow. Slow! -Wow! -[Christine] Oliver. It's dinner time. Do you wanna join us? Uh, no. I'll just grab a pizza. It's okay. You sure? I made lots of pasta. [chuckles] Uh, yeah, sure. That would be great. -Okay. Go wash your hands. -Yeah. I have-- I have nothing behind my back. Mm. I'm onto you guys. Onto you both. Let's go. [Christine] Anything's possible. -These days. -[chuckles] Hey, Mom, can we watch some TV? Did you finish your homework? All right. Half an hour and then you have to go to bed, -it's a school day. -Okay. Oh, he's such a good kid. You're really great with him. Thanks, he's a great kid. Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with you. I mean, you always put him first. I don't know, it's what parents do. Mine certainly didn't. I think you're amazing. The best part about it is you don't even know it. -Here, I got the dishes. -Oh, no. Please. No, no, no, I got the dishes. You cooked, I clean. Isn't that the rule? -Sure I read that somewhere. -[chuckles] Just sit back, relax, have another glass of wine. -I got this. -Uh... okay. [knocking] Here you go. All right. Love you. Have a great time with your daddy. -Be good for him, okay? -Love you, Mom. -I love you too. -You got everything, buddy? You know, what you said earlier... if you were looking to upset me, it worked. I don't like that guy staying here. Well, I do. We had a break-in the other night. A break-in? You kidding me? Are you okay? Yeah, the police thought it might have been kids, they went through the drawers but didn't take anything. I gotta tell you, I was really, really glad he was here. [sighs] You know what, that should've been me here, not him. Look... Chris, I know that I screwed up. But I wanted to let you know... I've started seeing a therapist and she's really, really helped me. We've talked through a lot of stuff and I'm thinking maybe you and I could maybe go to her and talk things out. How many years did I ask you to come to counseling with me? And I should've listened. But I get it now. What do you say, you and I go and... and let her tell you how much I've changed. Jason, I think it's a little late for counseling now. Would you do it for Oliver? You know, I hate to ask you this but this sudden change of heart, does it have anything to do with our custody hearing? Oh, no. I just... I really finally realized what a jerk I've been and how much I've hurt all the people that I love. Think about it, will you? Hello. Oh, hey. I looked over the files, all good. Oh, great. Any big plans this afternoon? Yes. I'm gonna sit here and finish this pile of paperwork. And then I'm gonna go home and finish that pile of paperwork by the pool. That will nice and quiet because Olly's at his dad's. -[chuckles] -Sounds good. So... there is this board of realtors fundraiser next week at the Beverly Hilton and I was wondering if... maybe you might wanna go together. That would be a great place to network. Yeah, absolutely. -What do you think? -Um, yeah! Absolutely, it'd be great. -[chuckles] -Excellent. I will get you the details and, uh... -we'll have fun. -Okay. -Good. -[chuckles] -[Nick] Gonna burn -[gasps] -Sorry. -Um... Did I scare you? Sorry, I thought you were at work. Oh, I was. I took a half day. It's so beautiful out here. -Here. -Oh, no, please. -You don't have to-- [chuckles] -Relax. Relax. Relax. Wow. You have got some big knots here, -what are you worrying about? -It's, um... nothing much, just some family stuff. Family? Oliver? No. Jason. What's he doing? He's actually being decent for a change. He wants us to start therapy together. [Nick] Hmm. And, uh... you? What do you want? Part of me wants to... do it for Oliver, you know, but... -The other part... -[chuckles] ...knows he's just trying to control you again, right? Yeah. Ow. You deserve so much better. Don't let yourself fall into that same trap again. -[sighs] -Did I hurt you? I'm sorry. I know it hurts a little bit in the beginning but... feels much better after. So relax, you're in good hands. Look, we're all trying to make this deal happen but we're just not gonna be able to sell a million three-door sellers. [Bill] Then we won't have a deal. Bill, we've got a backup offer and an agent begging for us to let us submit on this house. So let's be clear. Are you officially pulling your clients out of the running? Can we move on to the next buyer? [Bill] All right. A million. Two hundred and twenty-five thousand, that's our absolute limit. Write it up, send it over. We'll get it signed. Thanks. -[phone beeps] -That was amazing! What happened to this woman when you were married to Jason? Evidently, she was lost but she's back. Well, amen to that. Hey, um. So? What's going on with you and Nick? He's great. It's nice having him around and he is... really great with Oliver. You like him. He's so different, you know, he... He's the complete opposite of Jason. When we talk, he actually listens to me and he's always encouraging me. -This is bad, right? -It sounds really good to me. He lives in my guest house. I mean, what if something did happen and then it didn't work out, then what am I gonna do? Then you ask him to leave. Don't overthink it. You know, the Christine March who just negotiated this deal, she is confident and powerful, and not afraid of anything. You shouldn't be worried. You should take a risk. You know, live a little. Have some fun. You deserve it. [thunder rumbling] [door opens] Nick! Nick! Oliver! What are you doing? I was, um... just gonna check out your video game. No, it's not for kids, buddy. Okay? Then, can you take me and Lucky for a ride? Sure. Come on, let's do it. Hey, Eric, I got this guy on the line, says he talked to an agent here a couple weeks ago and gave a reference to a tenant. -Who'd he talk to? -Christine March. Says it's important. Chris's tenant? Okay. Put him through to my extension, I'll handle it. Sure. Thanks. You got this. Go ahead, keep leaning. Give him a little kick, let him know you want him to go. Good. Good. -Come on. -He's a big boy, so... Sometimes you gotta let him know you want him to go. [thunder rumbling] Okay, thanks for taking me out. You're welcome. I'm sorry it's raining, buddy. But let me tell you something, you're getting better. Your legs are stronger too. -Nick. -Yeah? I'm glad you're here. I'm glad I'm here too. The other day, my dad said that him and my mom might get back together. He did, huh? But if they do, does that mean you'll go away? I don't know what that means. But I'm here right now. Right? I'm not going anywhere right now. Promise. -That's awesome. -Awesome. High five. You're too slow again. Come on down. [groans] All right. [Christine] Did you get all your reading done? Yes. It's my job to be on your case. Why do you always have to be so good at your job? 'Cause I'm your mother. Get some sleep, okay? I love you. Love you too, Mom. You were looking awfully serious. No. Just thinking. About anything interesting? Dance with me. -Here? -Yeah. Right here. Give me your hand. [chuckles] [Nick humming] [chuckles] God. -You better go inside. -Um... I better go inside. Goodnight. Goodnight. [sighs] [whistling] What are you doing? -Were you watching this? -That was very romantic. Hmm. Don't tell me you're developing feelings for her, are you? No, of course I'm not. Well, that's good 'cause that's not what I'm paying you for. Get her in bed and get me the video. -I'm working on it. -Well, work faster. Got a custody hearing later this week and I want my son back. Gotta be able to show the judge what an irresponsible parent she is. She's not an irresponsible parent. It doesn't matter but... everybody will think so when you're done with her. I know exactly what Christine would go for. Somebody who's artistic and kind, good with kids. -Handsome. -And I like it. I like being Nick Reese. Nick Reese isn't real. Right? You're nothing but a cut right conman -working off a debt. -And I payed off my debt. And I want a new life now. I want a new life! Well, just remember, I got you out of jail, and I can damn well make sure you get thrown back in. Just do your job. -[grunts] -[gasps] I said I like being Nick Reese. [grunts] -[grunts] -[groans] -Oh! -[groans] Whoo! [chuckles] You swindled me. -Kinda. -You should go pro. Uh, hardly. I mean, I'm a pretty good player, you just killed me, you know that, right? Yeah. It's all right, are we-- are we done? -[chuckles] -[sighs] -[chuckles] -Good game. Yes, it was a good game. About last night, I... -It was nice. -It was nice. I just... I don't want you to feel like I was leading you on. You know, I don't know really what I want right now and-- You don't have to. Really? We both just got out of relationships, let's take it slow. Okay. I like you. I do. I like you a lot. I don't wanna blow it. Me either. So we'll just take it slow. Okay. [chuckles] I'll do this. -See how slow that was. -Very slow. Thank you. Excuse me? Yeah? Nick Reese here? Nick Reese. It's his shop? Why don't you stay right there and I'll see if I can go find him. [mobile phone ringing] -Yeah. -Hey, man. I got a guy here looking for Nick Reese. Who is he? Oh, you really want me to go ask? No, I'll be there in ten minutes, just make him wait. Listen, man, when I told you, you can use my business as cover, I didn't talk about people coming around here asking questions. Stop worrying, I'll be right there. [Nick] Hi. -I'm Nick. -Hey. -You're looking for me? -Yeah. -Nice shop. -Thank you. Could actually use a little body work done -on my car. -You came to the right place. How'd you hear about me? My name's Eric Cordon, I'm the branch manager at LA Home Source Realty. You recently signed a lease with one of our agents. Okay. We just got a call from your old landlord. Is there a problem? I've always paid on time. That's what he said. But then he received a fraud alert yesterday from the company that monitors his tenant's credit. Seems that, uh... Nicholas Reese with this social... was a victim of identity theft. Yeah, I, uh, I put that alert on there. My ex, Sherry, has been messing with me, she's been running up my credit. Is that right? Yeah. You check with the police if you want. I had to file a restraining order. Did Chris ask you to check up on me? No, I didn't wanna bother her if it ended up being nothing. Pretty dedicated branch manager. Christine's been through a lot this last year, I just wanna make sure she's okay. Well, Chris knows all about Sherry. She knows all about the problems that I've been having. [sighs] Is there anything else? No, no, that pretty much takes care of it. Uh, I'm sorry I bothered you. No, no, no, it's no bother at all. Christine needs people like you looking out for her. -Take care. -You too. The ground beneath your feet is crumbling, pal. I can handle it. I told you I didn't want any heat coming down on me. -Back off, Carl. -I'm not gonna back off. You need to know when to walk away. What, you're gonna let some scumbag lawyer keep blackmailing you like this? All you got to do is leave, what's he gonna do? I'll leave when I'm ready to leave. I'm not ready. Look, man, I appreciate everything you did for me in the join, I do. But I can't have that keep coming around here like this, I finally got a good thing going on-- I said I can handle it! You've gotta learn when to walk away. Shit! [footsteps approaching] Oh. Buddy, is Dad still not here? I think he forgot. Well, let me give him a call, okay? Jason, it's me, um, Oliver is sitting here waiting for you, literally. So give me a call, um, at home, okay? I'll try the office. Bye. [phone beeps] He's not coming, he probably has some stupid meeting -or something. -No, he always calls to cancel, if he has to. Let me try the office. Linda, hi, it's Christine March. Is Jason still there? Oh, really? -He didn't even call? -[car door shuts] Okay, well, if he calls to check in, just tell him to give us a call at home, okay? All right. Bye. -Where is he? -I don't know. He didn't show up for work today. Yeah, and he's not coming here either. Hey. Buddy, how're you doing? What's the matter? Well... Dad's not shown up, he was supposed to pick me up, and I've been waiting here for about an hour. My dad used to do that too. Sucks, huh? Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. Hey. -Bam, bam, bam! -Bam, bam, bam! -[Christine chuckles] -Atta boy. -Oh. -Hi. [chuckles] -Hey. -How are you? Good. Good. You really think he's gonna show up? I do. He wasn't a devoted husband, but he is certainly a devoted father. That's what this whole custody battle's about. Anyway, are you hungry? Uh, no, I, um, I'm gonna go meet some friends. -Can I help you up? -Yeah. Thank you. [chuckles] I'd love to see you later though. Okay, I'm here. [tires screeching] [static buzzing] [grunts] [sighs] [car crashing] Now, it's time to write you a nice suicide letter. [knock at door] [knocking continues] [banging on door] [banging continues] Christine, let me in. -Are you okay? -Yeah. -Where's Oliver? -He's sleeping. -Thank God you guys are okay. -Nick, you're bleeding. This car just came out of nowhere, -tried to run me over. -You should be in the hospital. I was so worried about you. -Why? Why me? -[panting] It was... it was Jason. -Christine, I saw his car. -That's impossible, he would never do anything like that. No, I saw him, okay, Christine? Maybe... Maybe he can't take losing you and he's going crazy-- Did he pick Oliver up -after school? -No. Nick, I found... I found a camera in my bedroom tonight, pointed at my bed. What? [groans] -[panting] -Hey, go sit down. Okay. I'm telling you, Christine. It was Jason. I saw him. I think he's going crazy. -[panting] -Okay, uh... -Let me go get some ice, okay? -Okay. Ice is good. Thank you. I'm so happy you're okay. I'm so happy... you're okay. You and Oliver. I'm so happy you're okay. [gasps] Mom! Mom, it's eight o'clock! It's almost eight o'clock! Oh. Uh, we're gonna be late. Go-- go get ready for school and I'll make you some breakfast, okay? Why is Nick on the couch? Don't worry about it, baby, just go get dressed, okay? -Okay. -Okay. -Hey. -Hey, how you feeling? Um, like I got hit by a car. -I'm so sorry. -Hmm. Police are gonna talk to Jason today. Um, if it was even him. -Christine, it's okay. -No, it's not and, um... if you hadn't met me, you wouldn't be in this situation. It's not your fault. I'm so glad I met you. Look, it's Jason, he's... unstable. We'll figure it out together, okay? Okay. I've got to get Oliver off to school. [siren wailing] [indistinct radio chatter] Amanda... -what's going on? -Didn't you get my message? No. Oh, God. It's off, it was a crazy night, but what's going on? Eric, he was run over last night in the parking lot. -Run over? -He's all right. He's alive. He's at the hospital. The cleaning crew found him this morning and called 911. They said that he's pretty banged up, but he's gonna be okay. I'm about to go see him now. -Do they know who did it? -No, the police are in here now looking at the security camera footage. What kind of monster would do this? [Marcus] Ma'am, we need you to take a look at this. Yeah, I'll be right there. [keyboard clicks] [keyboard clicks] [keyboard clicks] [keyboard clicks] Oh, uh... that's, uh... that's Jason's car. -Jason? -My husband, um, Jason March. All right, let's get plates and registration. Start that one with Joe Jones. Let's go. When was the last time you spoke with your husband? It's-- it's been days. Okay. Unfortunately, I don't think this is gonna be enough to get us a warrant. Now, I can start an APB out on him. I'll let you know the moment I hear something. -[Amanda] Thank you. -All right. Excuse me. What about my son? Your son? -Where's your son right now? -He's at school. I'm gonna call the principal. Okay, I'm also gonna need the phone number for your new tenant, this Nick Reese. It's fine, I'll give you his cell. I think he's at work. [Amanda] This just doesn't seem like Jason. [Marcus] The worst can bring out the worse in people. I see it a lot. Amanda. "By the time you read this, I'll be dead." -When was it sent? -[Christine] Yesterday, a little bit before midnight. "I tried to live without you. The truth is, I don't want to. If I can't have you, no one else can, either." Oh my God. -Jason. -All right. Look, can you forward a copy of that to me, it might speed up the process with this warrant. I have a key, I have a key, he gave it to Oliver, -I have it in my car. -No. I can't go in without a warrant. But I can, I'm still his wife, right? I can take you in. He could be dead or dying, we have to at least try. Please. -All right, fine. Let's go. -I'm coming with you. Go to the hospital and see Eric, I'll be there as soon as I can. [mobile phone ringing] -Hello. -Hey, it's Nick. I just wanted to tell you that I went to the doctor -and everything's gonna be fine. -Oh, that is great. You're not gonna believe this, but my friend Eric from the office, he was hit by a car too last night. Oh, God, that's terrible. He's pretty banged up, but they say he's gonna be okay. So, he's-- he's-- he's gonna be okay, that's good. Nick, it was Jason. they've got his car on camera. I-- I gave your number to the detectives, -they wanna talk to you. -Uh, yeah. Sure, of course. Uh, just be careful, okay? I gotta go, just please be careful. -Right, you too. -[phone beeps] [sighs] Okay, Nick. Fix it, you can fix it. Jason, it's Christine. Mr. March, this is Detective Marcus of the LAPD, please identify yourself if you're here. Jason? Please identify yourself if you're here. Mr. March? He's not here. -Is that his computer? -Yeah. You know the password? -An old one. -Let's check it out. -[computer beeps] -No. Why does he have a file on Nick? [Marcus] "Mail fraud, money laundering, aiding and abetting." "Brandon Freely." There's your Nick Reese. I don't understand. [door opening] I'm gonna catch up with you guys later. The camera you found in your bedroom was definitely feeding into his laptop. Do you think he had something to do with the break-in too? It appears so. Doesn't-- doesn't make sense. Jason wanted us to see a therapist, he wanted us to... you know, try to work on things. He's a defense attorney, misleading people is half his job. So, what... he paid some guy to get close to me? Brandon Freely, Nick, has several priors, most of them cons. Your ex defended him a couple of months ago. Got him off a money laundering charge on a technicality. -Jeff? -Excuse me. [Marcus] Mrs. March, your husband's vehicle was identified about an hour ago. It appears he drove off a cliff, late last night. Mr. March was pronounced dead at the scene, I'm sorry. [sobs] He... he... really... he really killed himself? I'm heading up there now. We'll know more soon. Oliver, his kid-- [sobs] I'm sorry for your loss. Wait, wait, wait, Detective, I don't want to be here alone. How worried should I be about this... Brandon Freely guy, should I check into a hotel? -Look, don't worry. -Maybe take Oliver to my mom's. We'll leave a uniform out front, you'll be fine. I mean, to be honest, the con is blown. The guy who hired him is dead, Freely's probably long gone by now. You're safe here. [sirens wailing] [dog barking] [door nudges open] [indistinct chatter over PA] Christine. Anything? Um... Jason's dead. Oh, my God, are you sure? He drove his car off this damn cliff or something. The detective... told me, I think he hired Nick. What? I don't know. What am I gonna tell Oliver? -Oh, honey. -Gets out of school in an hour. Oh, Eric. [Amanda] The doctor said he's doing pretty good. But he's on a lot of pain medicine, so... Hey, uh... I may have to take a rain check on the, uh... fundraiser. So Nick... Nick was driving the car. No, it was... it was Jason. Nick. I saw him. He's a criminal. His name is Brandon Freely. Did you hear that? -[grunts] -[Amanda shrieks] [Christine] No! Call the police! Call 911! -[Carl] What did I tell you? -Damn it! -You got to get out of town. -With what, huh? I got nothing. -I got nothing. -Would you rather go back -to jail? -I can talk to her. I can make her understand. No, you can't make her understand! -Yes. -She's just like that last broad, Sherry what's-her-name. Hey, you don't talk about Sherry that way. Sherry loved me! -Sherry loved you. [chuckles] -That's right, Sherry loved me. Yeah, it didn't stop her from threatening to turn you in, did it? You keep forgetting, man. The first rule of the con, don't ever let yourself care about your mark. I just... I just want a normal life, is that too much to ask? Yeah, for guys like us, it is. You gotta be cold, man, as cold as you were in prison, you remember that? You were like ice in there. If anybody mess with you... they were done. You're right. -I can't be Nick Reese anymore. -Nick Reese is dead. That's it. -I was promised a payday. -Yeah, that's right. -I'm gonna collect. -Yes! Can't have Chris, I'm gonna have the money. That's right. This is the guy that I know! I need a new identity, I need... -Wow. -...driver's license. I need credit cards, it's gonna be hard to get. Not this fast, man. I mean, what you're gonna-- How are you gonna do that? It's gonna be tough. -I'm gonna take yours, Carl. -Wow, hold on a second, man, Come on. After everything I've done for you? [yells] Come on! This is how you're gonna repay-- [gunshot] Sorry, Carl. Hey, babe, you almost done with your homework? I've got more math. Why? No reason, I just wanted to talk, that's all. It can wait. [phone ringing] -Hello. -[Amanda] Hi, it's me. Hey, Amanda. How's Eric? No, I haven't talked to him yet. [toy helicopter whirring] Olly. -Hey, Nick. -How you doing? -Good. -Yeah? I was thinking, uh... -you like ice cream? -Oh, I love ice cream. -You do, huh? -Yeah. Why don't we go get some? It'll be fun. We'll surprise your mom. -Okay. -All right, come on. Oliver? Oliver? Oliver? Oliver? Oliver! -Oliver! -[mobile phone ringing] [phone beeps] Hello. [Nick] I want you to know that I'm sorry it went down like this. I would've done anything for you. You're really an amazing woman, I admit that. What have you done? Where's Oliver? He's fine, for now. Don't go to the police. Please, please don't hurt him, he's just a little boy. I'll text you what to do. He won't be hurt. Go to your bank... transfer the money to the account that I'm gonna send to you. I'll be watching you. Please, Nick, I just want my son back. Then don't screw up. [phone beeps] [Oliver] Nick, where are we? [mobile phone ringing] Yeah. I'm at the bank. Good. Listen to me. Listen to me. I know exactly how much you have, send everything, except for 5000 dollars. You bring that with you to the next location, -I'll text it to you. -Nick, please don't do this. Get a hold of yourself, Christine. Remember, you're a strong, confident woman, you can do this. You have an hour. And Christine... any cops... anybody... anything... you'll never see Oliver again. [phone beeps] [sobs] Let me see your hands. Amanda? -[grunts] -[shrieks] [shrieks] Oh, you bitch. -Where's my son? -You're kidding. You're never going to find him. [gunshot] [grunts] Nick, where's Oliver? He's right up the hill, he's right up the hill. Please, I have to get to a hospital. You better hope I find him safe. Keep this on him, if he moves, you shoot him. Okay. Get to it. -Oliver! -Please. -Please, I need a doctor. -Shut up! Oliver! [Oliver] Mom! Oh, my God. -[groans] -[Amanda grunts] [gunshot] [screams] Olly! Mom! Mom. -Honey, are you okay? -What's going on? Okay. Listen to me, all right? There's a stream we're gonna follow, -we're gonna go get some help. -Hey! You're not going anywhere. You don't have to do this. You are making me do it. No, I'm not. You took my son. I love Oliver, I would-- I would never have hurt him. Oliver loves you too. I just wanted you to come. Okay, I love you and... we have a bag of money, we can go anywhere we want, together. -Right? -You-- you're gonna go with me? We can be a family. -Don't get so close! -Nick! -Stop right there. -Don't do it, please. -I don't trust you. -Oliver, run. -[grunts] -[groans] [groaning] [siren wailing] [Christine chuckling] [Amanda] Giddy up, giddy up, he's so cute. [chuckles] He looks good. He sure does. It's been awful for him, you know. It's the first time I've seen him smile. [Amanda] Oh, but he's tough. -[chuckles] -Just like his mom. He'll pull through. It's been such a horrific year. Feels like I've been living in some movie or something. I don't think I'll be able to trust anybody ever again. Oh, but you can't live your life like that. Might be safer. Yeah, but, it's not really living, is it? As they say, you fall off the horse, you gotta get right back on to ride it. -They do say that, don't they? -[chuckles] -[chuckles] -So... it's your turn. Good job. What do you think? I think you're a great teacher. Oliver is a natural. He's doing great. You think, um, you think I could try? Think you're ready? Sure. Perfect form.
