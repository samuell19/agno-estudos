Earlier tonight, Errlington County Police responded to a domestic violence call at the home of Elizabeth and David McMichaels, and found a gruesome murder scene. Police found David with multiple stab wounds to his upper body, and his wife, Elizabeth, in possession of an army bayonet, believed to be the murder weapon. David was pronounced dead at the scene, and police later arrested Elizabeth McMichaels and charged her with his murder. In Errlington County court today, Stewart Green, a court-appointed attorney for Elizabeth McMichaels, put in a motion to have her evaluated to see if she's fit to stand trial for the murder of her husband. Judge Williams granted the evaluation period, and McMichaels was transported to Bellguard Psychiatric Center. Remember, okay, just... don't work long hours. You need all the rest you can get, okay? Give up those late shifts if you have to, okay? Oh, really? Well, you gotta do what you gotta do over there fast with your brothers, and get your butt back to me on the double. We have business to take care of, Officer David McMichael. I love you so much. - Be good, okay? - I will. I'll call you when I get there, all right? I love you. How much longer? Without a strong signal, this navi ain't shit. Figure about a half hour or so. You think we should pull over and check on her? Why the fuck for? She's so drugged up, she don't know where she is. When you have this baby, you're not really going to need me around anymore with this little one running around all over the place. You're gonna have your hands full. - What are you talking about? - I'm just saying... I can take care of both of my mens. Oh, my God, baby. - Hi, David. - Hi, how are you? This is the best day of my life. Hi. Hi, baby, look at this. I got this little hat for the baby, to put on his head. It's a happy day! Let's see, how are you doing? - Okay, okay. - Okay, here we go. We need a big push, big push. Okay. Ready? One, two, three... Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God, baby, we have a baby. We have a baby. Babe, I'm so happy. Look at me. - Oh, my God. - Call a code. What the hell is... Let me see him, Goddamnit. Stop! Don't tell me to stop, I'm trying to see my child. I'm trying to see my child! Just stay back, please. Please stay back. Is he all right? Is he all right? Oh, my... Oh, she must've been some hot piece of ass, before she went nuts. You're going to hell, you know that, right? Not before I poke a few more before I go. Whatever, man. Let's get her in, and get out. This place gives me the creeps. And, um, let's make sure we stamp... I think that we should do an EKG on her, as well. Hey. How you doing? All right, so, um... I'm gonna continue my rounds, uh, but check back in with me when you've done all that. - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks, Beth. - You're welcome. Hello, Elizabeth. I'm Dr. Margaret Collins. I'm a clinical psychiatrist here at Bellguard Psychiatric Center. Do you know why you're here? Elizabeth? Elizabeth! Do you remember what happened? I'm here to help you, Elizabeth. You have to start talking, or you will be ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial. You'll spend the rest of your life in a place like this. Talk to me, Elizabeth. Talk to me. My baby. What happened to your baby, Elizabeth? What happened to your baby? He's sick. I have to get back to him. Let me out of here! Nurse Leonard? Let me out of here! - Please, let me out. - Calm down. - Please! Please. - Be still. At least that's something. It took a week, but it's a start. Carl, take her back to her room. Yes, Dr. Collins. Why did you bring me here? Why am I... You'll spend the rest of your life in a place like this. Why did you bring me here? Why am I here? What happened to your baby? He's sick... We'll take good care of you here. Why... Why? Hey there, Mr. DeRosa. This is everything I can find on the Internet about the McMichaels case. Thank you, Sue, and do me a favor, call me Tony. Anthony is the older guy sitting next door. That's my dad, better known as Mr. Grumpy. Okay, Tony. I just feel so funny being so new and asking you this huge favor. Listen, I know Elizabeth's a good friend of yours, and this is a big case in these parts. I can understand you wanting to help out. Bess. - Bess? - Bess, we call her Bess. It's just that it was... Oh, my God, I should not have done that without asking. Sue, sit down. Relax. Tell me about Bess. Bess and I were always together. We met in high school and then became more like sisters. That's where she met David. He was the school football star, and she was the star track athlete. They were perfect together. I was really overweight in high school, and Bess was always so supportive. When she asked me to be the maid of honor at her wedding, I said that she had to get my butt into shape, otherwise I would not fit into my dress. And she did. She did, she planned our workouts, she cooked all my food. Bess never cared how I looked, but she knew that it was so important to me. Bess had such a big heart. She just couldn't do something like this. She just couldn't. She sounds very special. She was. She is. She is. Good morning, Miss Elizabeth. How you feel today? Okay. So, you ready? Come on. There you go. Dr. Collins is really trying to help you, all right? Now, come on. Put your hand through there. Okay, not too tight, is it? There you go. Here we go. All right. We're on our way. Wait, wait. What's the matter, Miss Elizabeth? Take me back to that room. Miss Elizabeth, this room is empty. Please, please. See? It's empty. I've seen her. Seen who? Dr. Collins is waiting for you. Sometimes our mind plays tricks on us. Especially in a place like this. Good morning, Elizabeth. How are you feeling today? Elizabeth? Why don't we start today with the loss of your child? Is he all right? So, after an extended bereavement leave, David reported back to his unit. How did that make you feel? He needed to go back to them. He wanted to feel good again. How about you? You were alone now. Did you feel right again? I tried to go back to work. I couldn't. I just didn't... I just didn't feel right. Were you ill? Was it postpartum depression? I don't know, I just didn't feel right. Okay. Let's move on to the night you attacked your husband. I never attacked my husband! Why do you people keep saying that? You're being evaluated before standing trial for the murder of your husband. It wasn't David I killed. It was an intruder. An animal! Elizabeth... the one that you said would break into your home time after time and rape you but never take anything? He took a piece of me every time he raped me. Is that nothing? You were examined on the night of your arrest. The only semen found in your body was that of your late husband, David. That can't be. We never had sex after we lost the baby. Why are you here? I can't help you. You keep coming back here. You have to go. Why? Why are you here? You're dead! Why are you here? Why is she here? Why is she here? Why is she here? - Nobody's here. - She's dead! Why is she here? Come on, you're dead! - Nobody's here. - She's dead, come on, Why is she here? No! She's dead. Nobody's here. - No, she's dead! - Nobody's here. Nobody's here, you're alone. Now, you're gonna have a nice rest, okay? Atta girl, relax. Thank you, Carl. Very nice to meet you, I heard so many good things about you. Thank you, Dr. Harper. Uh, come in. - Dr. Collins? - Yes? Hello, I am Dr. Thomas Harper. Oh, Dr. Harper, hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. You as well. May I? Uh, please. I had heard the new head of psychiatry was coming, I just didn't know when you would arrive. Yes, when I was offered the job, I wanted to come in as quickly as I could to get going. Well, I'm glad you did. Um, as you know, Dr. Lewis fell ill and wasn't able to return to work, so we could use all the help we can get. From what I heard, you have been doing a great job with your tremendous work ethic, Dr. Collins. Thank you. I feel like I live here sometimes, but... Hopefully, I will help change that, so you can get some of your personal time off. What's that? So, where were you working before this? I was traveling overseas, and studying neuropsychological behavior that deals with extreme stress and trauma. Well, um, you've come a long way to our little hospital, Dr. Harper. I wanted to settle down and continue my research for paranoid disorders in a longer, observational way. Mm-hmm. And... and please, call me Thomas. Mm, well, Thomas, you've certainly come to the right place for that. I was hoping to tag along with you on your rounds to meet some patients and hear your prognosis on them. Um... now? If... if... if you're not too busy? Uh... shall we? Thank you. Good morning, Miss Elizabeth. Nurse Claire said you had a bad dream last night? It wasn't a dream. Okay. Well, it's time for your session. Maybe you can talk to Dr. Collins about it. Okay? You never even experimented with drugs in high school? No, Dr. Margaret, never. So, you've never tested positive for any type of drug use, yet on the night of your arrest, you had high levels of meth and other drugs in your system. Can you explain that? Hello again, Dr. Collins. This is Dr. Harper. He's the new head of psychiatric... - What are... - Calm down, Elizabeth. - No, please. - Dr. Harper's here to help you. No! Calm down, Elizabeth. Calm down! I don't know what got into her today. Nurse Claire said she had a bad dream last night. Um, was sedated as well. Did she give any more detail about her dream? The night orderly said, uh, she was yelling something about, "Why you are here?" You know, "You're supposed to be dead," or something like that. She may be having dreams about her late husband, or son. It's possible. Or she might be dealing with hallucinations from the trauma. She was doing so well. She seemed to really be coming around, she was talking a lot more. Carl, take her to her room, and keep an eye on her. We need to find out what's triggering her. How long has she been like this? Just since you walked in today. She's been fine, she's been talking so much more. Maybe a male's figure evoked something like this, I... I'm... I'm not sure. We need to definitely find out how to deal with this. Let's talk. Why aren't you fighting? Please, don't give up. There you go. Excuse my scribbles at times. Uh, I've been working on this so long, and I've come up with my own form of shorthand so as not to miss anything. I'm sure I can figure it out. Nice looking couple. I know. What kind of things has she been saying? She stays true to her story of being drugged and attacked repeatedly by an intruder. Have there been any other recording sessions with her yet? No. Well, she really only started talking last week, and I haven't wanted to inhibit her by changing anything in the sessions yet. I totally understand. I only gave her a light sedative. I'm going to go past her room and see how she's doing. Care to join me? Ah, I have another session with a patient, and then I have to finish my rounds. Okay, I will come and find you later and join you on your rounds. All right, then. Well, I'll see you later, Dr. Harper. I'll see you later. Okay, Miss Elizabeth. Ready for your nap? Okay, you've been up all day. Why are they here? Why are they here? Why's who here, Miss Elizabeth? Why are they here? Who? I need to get out of here. Why are they here? Why are they here? Why are they here? Why are they here? Why are they here? Why... Okay, Elizabeth, calm down and talk. Why is he here? Why is he here? I need to get out. Please, why is he here? - No, no, no... - No, please, why is he here? Why is he here, please... ah! Put her back to bed. Yes, Dr. Harper. Hello? Hello, is this Dr. Harper? Hi, Mr. Green. Thank you for calling me back. You're welcome. You're new to Bellguard? Yes, that is correct. I was recently appointed and wanted to get caught up with the Elizabeth McMichaels case. I submitted Dr. Collins' report - for the judges review. - Uh-huh. Waiting to hear his reply. Do you feel they will try the case regardless of her condition? If her condition is caused by the drug she was on, they may. From what I have seen so far, she's been dealing with major mood swings and erratic behavior. But is that drug related? We have had to keep her sedated to not hurt herself or anyone else. If we can prove her condition mental, that's different. Thank you, Mr. Green. Bring any new evidence, if you can. I will, and thank you again for calling me back. You're welcome. - You have a nice evening. - You too. All rise. The court of Errlington County versus Elizabeth McMichael is now in session. The honorable judge Charles Williams presiding. Please remain standing until the judge has entered and is seated. Be seated. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a closed evaluation hearing. If you are not part of the immediate family, the medical staff, the prosecution, or the defense team, please leave the courtroom now. In the case of the state versus Elizabeth McMichaels, Dr. Collins' report states that Miss McMichaels has shown signs of competency since her drug addiction detox, which suggests she will be competent to stand trial later this month. Mr. Greene, do you have any reason that suggests your client will not be ready? Your Honor, it's been brought to my attention that Elizabeth McMichaels has regressed from the original report submitted to the court, and that further evaluation is requested at this time. Your Honor, Dr. Collins' report was very detailed in the recovery of Elizabeth McMichaels during her evaluation at Bellguard. I don't understand the need to delay this trial any further. - Your Honor. - And who are you? My name is Dr. Thomas Harper, and I was recently appointed head of Psychiatric at Bellguard. I do apologize for this last-minute change in my colleague's earlier report. I witnessed only yesterday this change in Miss McMichaels' mental state. A different state from what was first diagnosed. She is showing signs of paranoid disorder, where a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. Do you feel this is something she will overcome? It is hard to say at this time. The damage is severe. It could be caused by the drugs she was using or by the trauma. My early prognosis is that Miss McMichaels may suffer from a psychological disorder. Your Honor, this is preposterous that Elizabeth McMichaels is now suffering from a psychological disorder? Where is Dr. Collins? Your Honor, I was told she was unavailable to attend today's hearing. Your Honor, Dr. Collins could not attend today due to personal matters. Dr. Harper, I appreciate your attendance today at this hearing, but the next time you answer a question in my courtroom that wasn't directed at you, I will hold you in contempt. Is that understood? Yes, Your Honor. Please accept my apology. Based on this updated information, I will grant two more weeks for additional evaluation. At which time, I want this settled. And I want both Dr. Collins and Elizabeth McMichaels in my courtroom. Do both parties understand? - Yes, Your Honor. - Yes, Your Honor. We're adjourned. All rise. Mr. Green. Hi, I'm Anthony DeRosa. I'm an attorney also. Please, my name's Stuart, and I know who you are, Mr. DeRosa. I did my thesis in law school on your father. Uh, cigarette? No, thank you, and call me Tony. - Nice to meet you, Tony. - Good to meet you as well. My dad was pissed I didn't do my thesis on him. Oh, no? Who'd you do it on? I did it on his old law school partner, Harold Cohen. Well, I bet that sit well in your Italian home? No, it did not. What brings you to court today? My secretary is the defendant's friend. She asked me to look in on the case. Well, not much to look into. The evidence is solid, it just comes down to whether she'll spend the rest of her life in prison or in the crazy house. Ms. McMichael, how do you feel about today's ruling? My son fought for this country. He gave his blood for it, and he almost died trying to protect us. And for him to come home and be murdered by some junkie whore of a wife, who you now say is crazy? That's unacceptable. What if she's found incompetent? My office is confident the defendant will be found competent to stand trial, where she will be found guilty of first-degree murder. And if we have our way, be put to death in the electric chair. Please, no more questions. It's just a matter of what her new address will be. Ms. Cruz, why did your daughter murder her husband? Ms. Cruz, answer the question. My daughter loved David. She would rather die herself than... than see anything happen to him. Does that answer your question? Come on, honey. Feisty woman. The redhead, she's my secretary. I see now. This is Christine Coleman coming to you live at Errlington County Courthouse. You know what? This might be a total waste of time, but if you could give me a copy on anything you got on the case, I'd really appreciate it. Keep the feisty one off my back. Sure, no problem. You're skeptical like your father was in that Hill Street murder case back in the day. Nah. It's my dad that's skeptical. - Nice to meet you, Stuart. - Yeah, you, too. Hey, I... I'd like to meet him one day. I'll tell you what. Come to my office with the files and I'll introduce you to him. Thanks, that'd be great! You got it. Have a good day. Hi, Carl, can I help you? - Is everything okay? - Dr. Collins, um... did you hear anything about Miss Elizabeth's, um, court decision? Yeah. I got a memo this morning. Apparently the judge ordered another two weeks for evaluation. Based on Dr. Harper's updated report. So, that's where that's at. Okay. Anything else, Carl? I really thought you were making... progress with her, you know? I know, me, too. She was starting to remember things more clearly. - She seemed authentic, right? - Yeah. But you've been around these types of patients longer than I have. You've seen this before. I mean, even before her relapse, she kept insisting that it was an intruder who broke into her house and would attack her, and who she stabbed. I mean, she never admitted that it was her husband she killed. She has been more sincere than anyone else. I mean, she sounds more sincere than anyone else. Well, people who suffer from schizophrenia can be very believable. They convince themselves that what they think is real. And because of this, they're tormented by it. Trust me, it's just not real. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Collins. Appreciate it. Elizabeth. I know you're tired. I'm gonna show you some photographs now. Can you tell me who it is? Is this David? Do you recognize this person? Do you recognize Sue, Elizabeth? God, I know. When I took all this chocolate, and I'm not even pregnant. Who is this, Elizabeth? Who is it? Mom. That's your mom. Mom. - Hello, Carl. - May I join you? - Of course, Dr. Harper. - Thank you. With trying to meet everyone and learning about the patients, I haven't thought about eating. Well, this place will do that to you. Well, I'm starting to see that. [Carl Mm. Carl, you seem to be a senior person here at the Bellguard. How did you come to start working here? Well... after I came home from the service, uh... I was doing some small handiwork from home, and, uh, well, a marine buddy of mine told me that, uh, Bellguard was hiring, so packed up my car, headed north and I've been here ever since. - You were a marine? - Yeah. Impressive. Nah, not really. Just a simple, old orderly. You're too modest, Carl. You seem to have built a connection with Elizabeth McMichaels. What are your thoughts on her? Oh, that's above my pay grade, you know, I mean, you and Dr. Collins, you know much more than I do about that. Come on, Carl. I'm sure you've seen a lot working here all these years and being in the service. You must have some thoughts about her. Okay. I believe her. I mean, call me crazy, but in all the time that I've been here dealing with patients, I feel sh... Miss Elizabeth is telling the truth. The truth? Carl, that an intruder breaks in, drugs her, and rapes her over and over, and kills her husband? That would be a boot move for someone like you. - A boot? - Boot. Well, I haven't heard that one in a while. Were you ever in the service, Dr. Harper? No, Carl, it's a term I learned working at the VA hospital during my internship. Well... time for this boot to get back to work. Carl, your feelings are valid, I admire that. Thank you, Dr. Harper. Listen... you have a great day. You too, Carl. Good evening, Miss Elizabeth. How you feeling today? Okay. Dr. Collins said you gonna be with us a little longer. Courts ruled for you to be evaluated a few more weeks. Here you go. Take it slow. Easy, Miss Elizabeth, easy. Come on, there you go. I can't stay here anymore. I know. But it's only gonna be for a short time longer. Look what I got for you. Smell that. Smell good, huh? All right, here we go. Okay, so let's put some here. And some here, and now rub it in. It's good for the dryness of your skin. This? Oh, this is my Marine Corps ring. See, every year, we have a little reunion, get-together in a small hall in town. I just take it out, polish it up a bit for the big day. What are you doing, Miss Elizabeth? No, don't... Don't pull on your gown. What? Hey... You a... you a service girl? My husband. Go get a room, go get a room. Come on, like you guys don't have great sex. That was crazy. That was really crazy. - That was insane. I... - I can't... I can't believe it. I can't believe you're doing this. I'm crazy for you. Whoa. - Oh, my God. - It's cool. - You like it? - Yeah, it's awesome. Special Forces Ranger. He's a real badass! Oh, hey, hey, hey. Don't cry, don't... Oh, I'm so sorry. Miss Elizabeth, I shouldn't have said that. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Miss Elizabeth, I'm so sorry. It's okay. Let me get you ready for the night. Carl? Thank you. Lance Corporal Carl Higgins at your service, ma'am. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, how you guys doing today? Hey, fellas. Good seeing you again, all right. - As usual. - Pauly! Good seeing you again, man, how you doing? In here, my friend, how are things? - Ah, you know, same old. - Same old? Crazy. You know, I heard on the news that your place is holding that GI's killer. You know, the addict wife who, uh, killed her, uh, hero husband. - Miss Elizabeth? - Uh. - Yeah, she's with us. - How she seems? - You know, sad, confused. - Hmm. Good to see you, too, enjoy. Yeah, take care of yourself. You, too. Have a good day. - But not a killer. - And why you say that? I don't know, it's just a feeling, I guess. - A feeling? - You ever... - Hey, Carl! - Hey. Hey! How you both doing? How you feeling, man? - Hey, doc? - Yes? What do you think about the wife who killed her war hero husband? It's a tragedy. I don't know enough about the wife, but she had to have been a lot of trouble to do something like that. Carl seems to think otherwise. Nah, I simply said she don't come across as a killer. She's just confused. Mm. I've seen my share of soldiers like that. They still killed when they had to. No, no, no, that was different. That was war. Well the news says she's an addict. Drugs affect people differently. Some get aggressive, can turn violent. You never know. Yeah, just like the government used that, uh, war candy drug. Turned men into killing machines. Yes. Even to the point where they were killing each other. Well, maybe she got it from her husband while having some, uh, you know, wild sex. - Hey, boys! - Hey! - How are ya? - Hey, man. - How ya doin'? - Carl. - How's the crazy house doing? - Oh! He went from fighting in one crazy place to working in another. How's the new hip going? Oh, Doc, this ti... titanium shit is the bomb. Matter of fact, I'm gonna go right now and cut up the rug with my girl. Cut it up for me, too! This guy, here. Still in their game. Look, I'mma get a refill on a drink. You guys want anything? Uh, hey, listen, you can give me another rum and coke. Yeah, you could use a rum and coke. - No ice. - Okay, no ice. Hey, uh, hey, Doc, um... what kind of symptoms did that, uh, you know... Did the men have, you know, that was taking the drugs? Sweats, crazed eyes, a lot of energy. Just last month, I was at the VA hospital in Virginia. Mm-hmm. This kid's sent back 'cause he stepped on a landmine, asked me for some of the good stuff he got in the field. I thought he was talking morphine. But he wasn't. Hmm, what did he look like? All dry, dehydrated, with chapped lips. I ordered him a bodily fluid. He looked pretty scary, like a zombie. So, is it possible that a wife, uh, could catch something like that, um, from her husband if he was on these drugs? Anything is possible, I guess. So, that means that she could possibly, uh... also act crazy, just like them, right? That would be a real stretch to think that way. If so, we would have GI killer wives running around. All right, all right, all right. Hey, all right. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, well, look, Doc, Carl. - Cheers. - Cheers to us. To us. To us. All right. Mm. Good morning, good morning. What's the matter, Miss Elizabeth? You not feeling well today? Get away from me! - Get away from me! - Miss Elizabeth, calm down! Please! Calm down. I need assistance. Hold her down. - What the hell happened? - I don't know. That girl got some kick. How did her leg restraint come loose? When I left her for the evening, I... I'm sure I had them all tightened up. And her condition today? Well, when I walked in, um, she seemed to be sleeping, but with this coldness to her. An... and then when I walked over to see how she was doing, I mean, she just went... Crazy, Carl? You are getting too involved. They are never who we think they are. Come on, let's get back to rounds. Everything's okay. It's all right. Come in. What is it, Carl? Are you okay, Miss Collins? I'm fine! Do you still think she's normal, Carl? Look, I left Miss Elizabeth responsive last night. So, what happened? I mean, she was talking with me, even gave me a little smile before I left to go to the reunion. And I'm positive all of her restraints were definitely tightened up. Dr. Collins, I just heard. Are you okay? I'm... I'm fine. Uh... Chuck, the orderly, got the worst of it with a kick to the chops. What happened? Uh, Elizabeth was sleeping, and when Carl got close, she snapped on him. Carl, would you excuse us, please? Yeah, of... of course, Dr. Harper. Margaret... I think this shows even more that Elizabeth is suffering from more than a trauma. In my studies, I've seen patients with this type of severe delusional disorder. Yes, Dr. Harper, I have, too, but never would such an appearance change from one day to the next. Her story has kept the same, and it's her physical health that is becoming a larger concern of mine. That is not a deluded illness. I understand your concern. I'm going to run a full evaluation on her, starting with blood work. Please let me take care of that. We have to find out what's going on with her. No, I'm... I'm fine, really, I'm fine. Margaret, let me take care of that. You take... you take the rest of the day off. Relax, do something fun with your son. I will start with the blood work and I will get to the bottom of it. Okay, thank you. I will let you know what I find. - Hi, Dr. Collins. - Rita! - How are you? - Hi, it's great to see you. - Yes, you, too. - How've you been? Okay, she's waiting for you. Oh, good. How's your family? Everyone's great. Glad to hear that. - Thanks Rita. - You got it. Margaret! Margaret, oh! Thank you so much for taking the time to see me on such short notice. Of course, I never have enough time with my favorite student. Listen, you sounded troubled over the phone. - Yeah. - Shall we? Thank you. God, I forgot how beautiful it is here. It is, you have to come back sooner. I know, I've been so busy at work, I can't tell you. I know, but... Oh, thank you. - Thank you, Rita. - You're welcome. You still teaching? Yes, but I cut it back to one day a week now. Good. Well, you know, the students are really different than when you studied with me. Technology, social media, I don't think they really understand the... The in-depth nature of the brain and the mind. I keep telling them, look, the brain is the physical organ that communicates and runs the body. The mind? The mind is a powerful, invisible, transcendent world of feelings, and attitude, and imagination. Dr. Barone, you have the most captivating way of expressing your thoughts. Please call me Jennifer, 'cause those kids would say today, "That's okay, teach, I'll Google it." I can't take it. Listen. Enough of this, you know, small talk crap. You have to tell me what's troubling you, I know you didn't come to this meeting so that you could enjoy my captivating thoughts. Actually, I did. See, I have this patient. You know, I'm usually so good at diagnosing patients right away. I can tell you the ones who are... Delusional schizophrenics, from the ones who are borderline, from the ones who are just acting deranged in order to reduce their jail sentence. Well, what's eating you right now? I have this patient named Elizabeth McMichaels. Oh, the wife who killed her husband? - Hm. - Yeah. Well. Break her down for me. First impression. Okay, um, hmm, scared. Um. - Quiet. - Hm. - Confused. - Second. She's more confident, um, determined. And now? Now... That's just it, she's getting physically sicker. And yet... And yet her mind still seems to stay focused. I mean, it seems like... It's like she knows what's going on with her, but she can't... explain it. No matter what she's been through and... And... and is still going through, she... Her story always stays the same! I have to find... that invisible. Hm. And you wonder why I call you my PRI student. You've got it. You can help her. Thank you. Uncle Anthony. Hey, Steven, thanks for coming. Well, always good to see my godfather. - Good to see you as well. - Everything okay? My dad said you needed medical advice. - How's the family? - Everyone's fine, we're well. Sit with me a minute. It's about a case I'm kind of working on. Okay. Hear about the woman that killed her husband in a drug induced rage? The Army Ranger. Caught his wife cheating, wound up dead? Yeah, it's all over the news. Well the story wasn't proven. There was only one person, and the sperm found on her? Was that of her late husband's. Really? So what are you thinking, unc? I'm not sure. Can someone's mental state change to the point where they would kill their spouse because of the loss of a baby? I mean, she was never known to use drugs before. She was prescribed a mild antidepressant when she lost the baby. She never even took it. How do you know all this? The wife is my secretary's best friend. Which is why you're kind of working the case. Yeah, and it doesn't add up to me. Maybe your secretary was in the dark about her. No, no. If you heard her speak about Elizabeth, you'd know she's telling the truth. Look, this isn't really my field, but I did study some extreme mental behavior during my internship. With violence, there's usually a pattern. Emotional instability, impulsive behavior, anger outbursts. Now, if that doesn't sound like her, and she wasn't cheating, and the only one that night was him... it does seem odd for a mental illness to cause her to stab him like that, in such a violent manner. Something pissed her off. Thanks, Steven. What about this, do you recognize her? It's your friend, Sue. Do you recognize Sue, Elizabeth? Elizabeth... this is your husband David. Do you recognize him? He's dead. Did you attack him? He's dead. What happened to David? What happened to David? The intruder! Did you kill the intruder? He's the intruder. Who was the intruder? He wanted to kill me. Did you kill the intruder? The intruder wanted to kill you? Yeah. Elizabeth, who is the intruder? I didn't kill David. Get away from me! But with this coldness to her. Crazy, Carl? That war candy drug. Do you still think she's normal, Carl? Nurse Claire said you had a bad dream last night. He looked pretty scary, like a zombie. How's she doing? Blood pressure is high. Her body temperature is low. If this keeps up we have to transport her to county. What... what brought it on? I don't know. Dr. Harper's running tests. Listen, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy... but I think that Miss Elizabeth is acting this way because of the drug. You think that we're drugging her to make her this way? No. Well, I'm not sure... but I've been doing some research. You've been doing research? Yeah, you see, Pauly was talking about some kind of war candy drug. And Doc said that made men like zombie killer machines. Killer... Do you hear yourself? Zombies? Killing machines? This is not "The Walking Dead", this is real life. I know, but Miss Elizabeth is... She has some of the same symptoms that Doc said he's seen in some of the soldiers he treated in the fields. I get why you want to find a reason why she's here, but it's not because of any drugs. You, please, have to let that go. Listen... Now, maybe, she contracted it from her husband at first, but she's been getting worse ever since that new doctor got here. That's absurd. Some blood tests. That's all I'm asking. It's been done. Well, have you seen the results? Not yet. Beth, hi, it's Dr. Collins. Listen, can you get me the results on blood work that Dr. Harper ran on patient three-four-six-five? Elizabeth McMichaels. Are you sure? Right, thank you. She said no tests have been run on this patient. How could he forget that? He didn't forget. Miss Elizabeth is trying to tell us something. I can see it in her eyes. Her invisible... Get me a kit, let's draw her blood. Uh, take these two and drop them in the outbox to be tested, okay? - Yes, Dr. Collins. - Um, dispose of the third one, two is enough for what we need, okay? - Okay. - I'm running late to do my rounds. And thank you. Thank you, Carl. You've got me thinking now. So how long is it gonna be before we get the results back? Usually 24 to 48 hours. Well the court date is in two days. - I know. - Well, what if - we don't get it back in time? - You know what? I'm gonna call them from the car to expedite. Oh, my God, I'm running late. Okay, I'll see you in the morning, Carl. Okay, uh, and thanks again! Keep a close watch on her tonight. I will. Rick, Hi. I'm running a little late. - Hey, where are you? - I'm running late... I'm on my way to pick Michael up. I just... I had an emergency with a patient, but I'm on my way. What took you so long? I... I just got stuck with a patient. Um, listen, tell Michael if I don't get there by the end of the game, just go home with Ben and I'll pick him up from Ben's, okay? All right, all right, well, be careful driving. - All right. - And pick some ice cream on the way home. Prick. Okay, all right, I'll see you soon. Bye. Hey Chuck, what's going on here? - You didn't hear? - What? Dr. Collins died in a car accident last night. - What? - Police said her alcohol level was twice the legal limit. - They said what? - Yeah. That's crazy! What... What about her son? She was alone. Hi Carl, I'm Detective Seagara, this is my partner, Detective Harris. How you doing? Carl, we just had a conversation with Dr. Harper about the unfortunate death of Dr. Collins, and we'd love to ask you a couple of questions. Sure... sure, yeah. When was the last time you seen Dr. Collins? Uh, around last night, around 7:30. Well, did she say where she was going after she left work? Yes, she said that after she got through with her rounds, she was gonna go pick up her son. What time and where might she be going? Uh, I don't know. Well, was she ever intoxicated at work? Mr. Higgins? Mr. Higgins! Uh, um. Was Dr. Collins ever intoxicated on the job? Of course not. That's crazy, absolutely not. - Are you sure? - She didn't drink. Okay, well, thanks a lot, Mr. Higgins. Appreciate your time. Hello, Miss Elizabeth. How are you feeling? Bad news. Dr. Collins was... Was in an automobile accident. On her way home from work. And she didn't make it. Detectives said she was intoxicated. That's impossible. She didn't drink. She didn't have to die like that. Miss Collins cared about you... and she was suspicious, too. And I owe it to her. To find out what's hiding behind those eyes of yours. Tomorrow is your court date. I'll see you in the morning... to get you ready. Hi Carl. I wanted to extend my deepest condolences. I know you and Dr. Collins were close, and have been working together for a very long time. Yeah. We were. Come on, sis. I know things aren't good. My body's rejecting the kidney, isn't it? No, that is not true. Doctor says sometimes it takes a while - to accept the new organ. - I've been through this, Bess. My immune system is fighting it, I know the symptoms. Yeah, but you have to keep fighting. Tired of fighting, sis. Listen, just don't give up. You hear me? Promise me you won't give up. I love you. I know you do... but now it's my time to watch over you, okay? Come give me a hug, I can't move too much. - Hello, Carl. - Hi, Dr. Harper. I'll be back soon, I'm getting Miss Elizabeth ready, okay? Uh, Carl, I want you to stay back today and look after things here. I'll take one of the other orderlies to go to court with me. Well, I think Miss Elizabeth would feel better if I was to go with her. No, Carl, that is not an option. I already had Claire get her ready, so continue on your rounds. You can see her when we come back. Yes, Dr. Harper. Good afternoon, everybody. Is the defendant in the courtroom as requested? Yes, Your Honor. Dr. Harper suggested not to bring in Ms. McMichaels until needed. She's needed, now. And Dr. Collins? Forgive me, Your Honor, I thought you knew. Dr. Collins died in a car accident last night. I'm very sorry to hear that. We will continue with the proceeding, and I will again review the notes and earlier report from Dr. Collins, before rendering my decision. Excuse me, Beth? Hey, you got a sec? I need a favor. Sure, love. - How can I help you? - Yeah. Uh, I heard Dr. Collins the other day. Oh, my God, did you hear what happened to her? That poor thing. She ordered a blood test on a miss, - uh, Elizabeth McMichaels? - Okay. And I was wondering if the results came in yet. Elizabeth McMichaels suffers from a psychological disorder. A serious mental illness called psychosis. She cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. The main feature of this disorder is that unshakable belief of something that is not true. For example, her constant talk of an intruder, and being drugged, and raped. Someone with this disorder experiences hallucinations, visions. Bizarre states that may occur in real life, such as being followed, deceived, or being poisoned. Dr. Harper. Couldn't it just be a drug binge and not a mental disorder? That the excessive partying and drug use of Elizabeth McMichaels, led to her losing her child, being so filled with hate that she murdered her war hero husband, David, in cold blood. I'm sorry, there haven't been any tests run on her... in the last two weeks by any doctor. I dropped them on... I dropped them off myself. - Son of a bitch. - Is... is everything okay? Is... Anything I can help you with? Yeah, listen, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. No, it could not. Why is that, Dr. Harper? Your Honor. Miss Kelly. Does that look like someone who is on a drug binge? No. The answer is no. Elizabeth McMichaels is delusional. Delusional? Order in my court. Order in my court. Hello? Sure, send them in. Mr. Higgins, come on in. Hello, Mr. DeRosa. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. Oh, my pleasure, have a seat, Carl. Thank you. They told me you have some important information on Mrs. McMichaels? Yes, sir. What's on your mind? I don't think Miss Elizabeth is crazy. You don't? No sir. She looked pretty crazy to me. You see her in court the other day? No, I saw her when she returned to the center. What are your thoughts? Were you in the service, Mr. DeRosa? No, I wasn't. My dad was. He was drafted in '68, he served three years in Nam. He come home? Yeah, thank God he did. He's the old guy in the office next door. Carl, let me ask you a question. What does that have to do with Mrs. McMichaels? You ever heard of a drug called... war candy? I brought this information to Dr. Collins and convinced her to do a blood test to see if there were any other kind of drugs in her system outside of what was prescribed for her. - Did she? - Yes. What were the results? The blood results never came back. Why wouldn't there be any results? Because Dr. Harper removed the blood samples before they could be tested. For what reason? So his colleagues couldn't find and expose the truth. Which is? What's behind her eyes. Meaning? Her invisible. She could... She could just make them again. Pop, Dr. Collins died in a car accident the other night. Police said she was intoxicated. That's a lie. I mean, Miss Collins never drank. In all the years we worked together, I've never seen her touch any type of alcohol. So, different situations could change that, Carl. No, no, she wouldn't even sip champagne at our holiday parties. Her father was an alcoholic. It killed her. And she swore that she would never do that to her son. So what do you think happened, Carl? Harper. After he removed the blood samples... he knew... that he had to sign it. So, he drove off the road, shot her up with some kind of drug that made it seem like she had some kind of high level of alcohol in her system. What about you, Carl, they're not worried about you talking? He probably figured who going to listen to an old ass orderly, who's been living around a bunch of crazy all his life. Hey, I might be next. Oh, but why would Dr. Harper wanna do all this? I don't know. I mean, ever since he's been at Bellguard, it's like, Miss Elizabeth has been regressing to the point that Dr. Collins has been getting worried about her physical health. I mean, it's like when... Miss Elizabeth sees Harper... it's like she sees the devil. She looked possessed in court the other day. I seen him in her room the night before. And the next day, he told me that he didn't want me to go to court with them. And he wouldn't even let me see Miss Elizabeth. Now, whatever it was... that he was giving her... leading up to that, made her act that way. For all to see. Well, maybe we could petition the court to get a new blood test. On what grounds? Harper's too smart for that. I mean, I bet right now he's... He already began to wean her off of whatever it was that he was giving her. I don't see what else we could do without the blood test results. What's this? The third blood sample that Dr. Collins took the night she died. Something or someone... made me keep it. It cost her her life. I guess he's not as smart as he thought. Even if we get this tested, and it shows a high level of some crazy dangerous drug, they still can't prove Dr. Harper was behind it. But you know what? It's a start. Dr. Harper. Needs to be stopped no matter what, before he kills Miss Elizabeth. - Hello? - Hello, Dr. Harper? - Yes. - This is Stuart Green. The judge ruled that Elizabeth McMichaels is not mentally fit to stand trial. She will remain at Bellguard for the conceivable future. Thank you for calling, Mr. Green. - You have a good evening. - You too. Hello Bess. I... I came to give you the good news. The judge ruled you are mentally incompetent to stand trial. You will not be going to prison for the rest of your life, or getting the electric chair for killing your decorated war hero husband. You will remain right here at Bellguard under my care for the rest of your life. Man... what memories these smokes bring back. On short leave, your husband and I used to go out into the town, buy a pack of these Iraqi cigarettes and have a real good time with the locals. Their tobacco is potent. I remember the first time I saw a photo of you. David had just received a letter, and pulled it out from an envelope. From afar, I could see this hot body of yours, and this beautiful face and smile. I grabbed that photo from him, I pick it up, and I looked, and I knew right then, right there, I had to have you. You killed him. I had to see you with my own eyes, so I backed off talking about you so much to David. And I started to play into his thoughtful side, as the holidays approached. Told him I wasn't going stateside for the holidays, since I have no family to go home to. David bought that story hook, line, and sinker. He was so gullible, but such a good human being. It was then that I started administering my drug to you. I added it wherever I could around your house. And once I saw it taking effect, I knew it was time to make my first house call and finally get what I have been dying to feel since I saw that hot body in the picture. You gave me the biggest hard on. Oh, my God. It was amazing! All those dreams I had of making love to you, could never live up to how I felt when I was in you. You see, Bess... David didn't have to die. Neither did your baby. You could have divorced David, and I would've... I would've raised your baby and loved him as my own. But no! You had to keep fighting me! You had to keep fighting me! None of this had to happen! None of this had to happen! You killed him. You killed my baby. I didn't know David was going to show up that night. When I heard him call out to you, I knew I had to do something. But then to my surprise, you didn't listen. You killed David for me. Why did you kill me? Why did you do it? You killed him, You killed my baby. You meant to kill David. He didn't want you anymore, you took him out of the picture so we could be together. Nice, nice. Liar! I do not lie. Murderer. Murderer. I knew how much more you loved and wanted me. How much more I entertain you. In order to make it look like it was David you were having sex with anytime we were together, and especially that night you killed him. I would always carry your husband's sperm sample with me. Now, getting it was the hard part. I would have to have David so fucked up, like, really fucked up, and then have one of the local girls jerk him off so I could collect the samples. You're a liar! I hate you! And... and Dr. Margaret! Dr. Margaret, she didn't have to die either. But she had to get so suspicious, and... And come and draw your blood! You monster. Good thing I intercepted her and the testing or who knows what would have come from it? You're a monster. You see how hard I had to work, Bess, for us to be together? I hate you. I took another man's job so I could protect you. Do you realize that? I hate you. I hate you. Well, I didn't know that this would happen. Now, we'll make the best of it, won't we? No. Bess. Bess, one... Once you accept the fact that we are going to be together... it's going to be really beautiful. And good. I... And I think some... I... I... I will lower your doses, so we have lots of enjoyable sex together. But we'll have fun. We'll have our own baby! Our own baby. We'll create a family in our house with a fence, and a dog! And as they say, we will live happily ever after. I hope you appreciate what I had to do to be with you. I hate you. I hate you. I have some errands to run. I will come back later to check on you. I hate you! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. I hate you. You killed him! You killed him. You killed my baby. You killed my baby! I hate you! Please, somebody. Please, somebody help! - Hello. - Hey Carl, it's Anthony DeRosa. Listen, you were right. Blood test results showed a high level of a hallucinogenic drug, LSD, and a drug called VZ. Now it doesn't prove Harper's behind it, but we can go to a judge with this new evidence and try to get them to authorize more testing in another facility. Yeah. Carl, listen, don't do anything crazy. We just need a little more time, but we can get him. There is no more time. Carl, Elizabeth is gonna need someone she trusts to find her way back home. Thomas Harper? Um, yes? Or should I say Dr. Nick Norman? Um... I'm sorry. I think you're mistaken. My name is Thomas Harper. Your fingerprints say otherwise, Doc. Dr. Norman... you are under arrest for the murder of Dr. Margaret Collins, David McMichaels and his stillborn child. Rape and criminal battery assault, and the drugging, torture and false imprisonment of Elizabeth McMichaels. All right, Doc, let's go, stand up. Hands behind your back. I bet you we got many more charges to add to that. Do you have any proof, Detective Seagara? In your own words, Doctor. Dr. Margaret? Dr. Margaret, she didn't have to die either. But she had to get so suspicious, and come to draw your blood. Let's go. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint you one. Carl. Hello, Miss Elizabeth. Ladies. Wow... you look great. So, how you feeling? Better now. Good. Thank you so much for coming. Well, I needed to see you off, going home. I don't know if I'm ready. You are ready. I want you to have this. Carl, this is beautiful. But I can't accept this. Look... you're one of the bravest people that I've ever met in my life. And if anyone deserves that medal... it's you. Thank you. And please, call me Bess. Okay, Miss Bess. I heard you retired. Yeah. I couldn't continue to work there after all that had happened, you know? So, uh... I figured I'd buy me a fishing pole. And I like to fish. Well then I'll buy two. Now, you know I'm going to continue to check up on you like I always did. I wouldn't want it any other way. Good. Come here. Wait. You know, you give a lady a proper hug... Lance Corporal Higgins. Oh, look at you! Wow, come here. Thank you so much, my friend. And thank you for not giving up. Lance Corporal Carl Higgins.
