Where's the umbrella? Have to go to the station. "There's a breeze... Nobody has ever seen it." Welcome. How may I help you? I want a birthday present. How about this birthday gem? It's exquisite and inexpensive. Men seem to like this kind. We have necklaces too. Well, I'll have a Virgo. This way please. I'll have two. Please wrap them up. Alright. What is it? Open it. A new product? Stupid. It's for you. I had no idea what to buy. He's here. Give me a puff. Your ex-boyfriend's gift? Are you jealous? I'm too old for that. It's from Natsuko. I'll let you have it. She has good taste. Hideo. Why so late? Went to Shinjuku for a drink with Etsuko. It's no fun. Yeah? Get some sleep. Someone committed suicide today. Some scene at the kindergarten. Really? ...Goodnight. Here's... Are you okay? I'm okay. Must have been the food. AFTERNOON BREEZE How does this look? Good. Don't keep staring at me. Read this. Senpai, your telephone. I guess it's from Him! You're a big mouth. Dry her hair, will you? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry. Better not keep him waiting. It's not like that. I almost got raped today. What? One of the kids, you know. Oh, you mean Hiro. Yeah. I took him to the restroom. Then he locked the door. "Take off your pants", right? "in" thing among kids. Girls should watch out. What a filthy idea! You're right. Hurry up, Yumiko. Coming. Bye-now. Dangerous for girls. What's this? Virgo? I bought it by mistake. Watch out for men. How about you? Not for me. I won't degrade myself. Sorry to keep you waiting. What a day. Wasted time talking to a client. It's a hard job. Will you try your beauty salon again? I can't. They'll know about us. It's from Natsuko. She a lesbian? She uses the handkerchief at times, too. We use a white handkerchief while they use a plaid one. The white one doesn't always mean you. Excuse me. Is anyone there? It's hot. May I speak to Hideo Yamaguchi of the sales dept.? Yes. Is that so? What time will he be back? May I leave a message? Tell him that I'll wait for him at Boozy, Shibuya at 7 tonight. Right. My name is Mitsu Nemoto. Thank you very much. What is it? Tell me. What is it? You're looking at the time again. Are you expecting someone? Where's Mitsu? What would you like? – Coffee. Let me introduce him. Hideo Yamaguchi. He's a salesman for cosmetics. Etsuko works with me at the kindegarten. I envy the kids... surrounded by beautiful teachers. Excuse me. Etsuko, it's been a week now. Why don't you talk to me? I'm really sorry. I apologize. I'll treat you to dinner today. Etsuko! He said it's a new product. You guys are doing okay? I'm supposed to meet him. I'd better leave. Women should watch out! I was gonna pick you up at the station. – Thank you. He must be hungry. What does he eat? Sunflower seeds, fruits, bread... Eating too much will kill him. What a burden. It's like our baby. Sounds good to me. Didn't I tell you? I won't get pregnant. What happened? He's dead. Natsuko. Don't do the laundry for me. I don't like that. Don't waste your time. Go out and have some fun. It's okay, I don't mind. I just don't like that. How about going to the seaside for vacation? There'll be no one there. Forget about everything. The sea... You'll feel much better. The sea... Might be a good idea. Really? Haven't left Tokyo for a while. This will be our first trip together. I'm sure it'll be fun. What's on your mind? Why did you introduce Etsuko? I'm sorry about Hideo. I told him not to come. Didn't know he'd come anyway. It's alright. Getting along well with Etsuko? Are you gonna marry her? Maybe. What is it? Will you intrdouce me girls? Break up with Mitsu. Break up with Mitsu. Break up with Mitsu. I really mean it. Get out of here. Isn't that Mitsu's? So you're really gay. MITSU... NATSUKO That feels great. Don't tell me you'd jump from here. Why should I? It's unusual for you to come here. I was gonna ask you for a drink. Good idea. I'll kill time and wait till you're off. I'm off now. Let's go to the movies. Better get back to work. It doesn't matter. What's wrong? Sometimes it feels great to run. I've shoplifted this. You did that? I didn't mean to. You're really something. Shall we go and pick up some boys? I said boys. O.K. What a place. I guess it's hopeless tonight. We can relax here. You like a pretty face. That one will do. He's not my type. Introduce me to your boyfriend. We broke up. What can I do for you? Is Natsuko here? Are you Natsuko's friend? I'm Etsuko. She's out. Come in. She hasn't been to the kindergarten. Really? Yeah, I was a bit worried. Have some tea. Where does she go? Did she say she'd go to work? Yes. This is a nice lighter. It was a gift. Pity that I don't smoke. Thank you. Everytime when I saw... this hotel from the train... I wondered what kind of folks were there. ...folks like you and me. Like us? Etsuko is very pretty. Did Natsuko tell you? Natsuko is in love with you. Isn't she a lesbian? No she isn't. It doesn't matter. She introduced Etsuko to me. She's kidding by using a handkerchief. She was a virgin. Did you... On the condition I stop seeing you. But Natsuko... Give me the sweater. I'll call you. It's raining again. Oh you're back. I took a taxi. Why are you sitting in the dark? Want a drink? Etsuko came today. Oh... I quit. It's no fun. What's wrong with you? You look strange. I can't stay with you. Hideo told me everything about Etsuko, too. I can't stay with you. How long have you been pregnant? Whose baby is it? Get out of here tomorrow, will you? I don't want to see anyone. Anyone. It's raining again. Finished this week's work? Poor baby. When are you expecting? None of your business. What do you need? I'm the sister of Mitsu of Room 302. Can I get into her room? I see. So you're her sister. Sure. Did you wait for long? Shall we get in?
