I'm sorry I put you in danger. Never mind. It's exciting. You hid only one gun in the bathroom, didn't you? Why do you ask? If that's the case, that's too bad, 'cause I took out all the bullets. But don't worry. I put them in your shirt pocket. How did you know? The scene was pretty realistic, but I still noticed it. Do you know where your boss is? Shit! There's a fight downstairs. Come and check it out! Let me go! Okay. Meet me at the car. Don't be long. Mod, come with me. I'll go check downstairs. The police might've come. Hey! What the hell are you doing? I'm hurt. Look! You should hang it out in the sun, girl. Hey! Stop it, please. Stop! I'm hurt. Stop it, please. Hey! I'll help you. Do you think I'm afraid of you? Hah! Don't make me laugh! Bastard! I can go myself.

A long and bloody battle has left a bar manager and six of his men dead. The bar manager was the one accused of giving shelter to Suah Sak, who is now being prosecuted. Yos! The boss told you to change your mobile phone. Don't be too trendy! Take this ordinary model. The battery never goes dead. Yeah! This'll suit those Thick-Skinned Bandits. Give me one of those so we'll look like partners. You don't need one. You've already got thick skin. What a feisty woman! I wonder what kind of man could tame her? Okay! Finished! Wait! Wait! Wait! It's too long. Here! Here! Yeah! Come in. All right. It's okay now. - Is that okay? - Okay. Do you think it's strange that the police couldn't catch those bandits for all those years, but then they were arrested so easily out of the blue? Today, the "Five Bullet Bandit" will be taken to the Pitsanulok Jail where the Wieng Tai State leader is imprisoned. We're not sure if the bandits are targeting the Kao Yod Commander or not. So...I'm sending you to the jail to keep an eye on them. I always get these kinds ofjobs. I'd like to know if...well... Will there be anyone to watch my back? Like who? You like to work alone, don't you? You've never needed any help before. Hey! What kind of boss are you? You don't understand me. I meant a person who will watch my back. Oh, I forgot to mention-- I'll be sending special officer Duang Dao to go with you as a prison guard. Ha! That's great, boss. That's very kind of you. You've failed, man. Hey! Yos! Shit! Hey! I only ordered seven girls. Why eight? Damn your father, Eight? She's my sister. Ha! All right. How do you know my father's name is Eight? Hey! Come and talk with me. How do you know? Mayom, why have you come here? You have exams don't you? Why aren't you at home? Mom asked me to bring this food to you. She's afraid you won't have anything to eat. But it looks like you have too much food now. Thanks. If I'd known the party was going to be like this, I'd have come earlier. Who invited you? Go home now. This doesn't concern you. What? You're having a party, aren't you? Good! I'll tell Mom. Mayom! Mayom! Don't tell her. I'll go home. Let's go! Hey, girls, Yos will pick up the tab! Let's go! Go! Go! Hey, man! It's on you, isn't it? Hey, aren't you paying for it? I'll only pay for the food. Everything else, you pay! Bye! What the hell? What, you're leaving too? Samorn! This isn't funny! You better speak up fast before you turn into a real ghost. I'm so scared, I must look like a ghost! I've already got all the information regarding the Kao yod Commander.

At th is stage, officers believe both of them are still in the country. The pol ice aren't as du mb as you th i n k. They know you're sti l l i n the cou ntry. I would like to than k you all for getting the commander here safely, without a scratch . What do you want from me? I appreciate your idealism, but it's not possible for your state to gain independence, despite the fact you and your troops are h igh ly capable. Why? You know how to hel p us? Of course!

Du ri ng World War II, there was a lawman who used h is holy sword and noth i ng else to fight the bandits. Th is sword was cal led the " Metal Tal isman Sword." Can th is metal tal isman sword real ly ki l l those band its? Su re, si r. Even the strongest bandit possessed of black magic fel l to th is sword. SUAH MAH ESAK Th is is the wrong way. We have to go back and tu rn right. Samorn's map is u nclear. I beg you, please. Don't force me to si n anymore. I'l l ask you one more ti me. Where's the sword? Si n ! Si n ! To prevent a fight i n th is temple, I'l l tel l you where the metal tal isman sword is. The sword wi l l choose its own master. Fix you r m i nd u pon the Buddha and make a wish . It depends on you r l uck. Is th is the metal tal isman sword? It looks l i ke a rusty old piece of sh it. Don't fol low them, Dao. They're just poor th ieves. . . who were h i red to do it. We'l l never know who h i red them. It might have been someone i n ou r organ ization . How else wou ld he know about the sword? The ch ief is investigating. I don't u nderstand what the mon k said. If th is rusty sword touches the blood of a vi rgi n woman, it wi l l be as sharp as before. It's i mpossi ble. No way! Look! It can't even protect itself. How can it protect someone else? No way! Hey! Can I use you r blood to test th is sword? No! I guess so. Sh it! Have they come yet? I can't wait. Al l right, si r. I've arranged everyth i ng as you req uested .

Th is is bigger than from any other wal l . I th i n k th is is the best place, si r. The best place might not be the safest, though . Check the south agai n . Have they contacted us yet? Fou r more people have died. The mistress and the ch i ldren are safe. Five soldiers are comi ng today to hel p us here. Commander. . . can you trust them? Why don't we do it ou rselves?

You potty mouth ! How can you tal k about my gi rlfriend l i ke that? Why? What's wrong? I'l l say whatever I want. What are you goi ng to do about it? Yos gets Dao. Yos gets Dao. Dao gets Yos. Got a problem? Yeah ! A man l i ke Tiger Blade is never outsmarted by anyone. I won't lose my chance to see you al ive, Commander Kao Yod of Wieng Tai . I want to know you more.

Where are Jenji ra and Mahesak h idi ng? We'l l work it out. I guess not. J ust how d id those th ieves know where to go looki ng for the sword? Did they know th rough a sou rce?

Remember th is-- next ti me, I won't let you go! you never thought to spare me. I know you wanted to shoot me that n ight. We both deceived each other from the begi n n i ng. So bel ieving anyth ing the other says is pointless. I'm sorry. I shou ldn't have shouted at you . Me too. How did you get th is pictu re? Someone sent it to the office. It m ust be h im .

Commander Kao Yod said we've got a spy. It's true. But he doesn't know who it is. Utane! Impossi ble. What wou ld he get out of it? Money! Th is was recorded at 1 : 00 a. m. He cal led Chon bu ri .

How do you know who shou ld be i ntercepted? Wait for my signal . The boss should make the decision . I don't know. I'l l i ntercept everyone. There's a lot of money deposited i n h is ban k accou nt over the last few days. It's a secret ban k accou nt. He used an al ias and a fake passport. But I can't tel l now, so I'l l ask Samorn to fi nd more i nformation . But. . . I want you to cut Utane out of the game. They've taken Mayom. To ki l l someone with one bu l let. . . is too easy.

Who owns th is bu i ldi ng? The go-cart track owner? No, Suchat. It doesn't belong to h i m. He rents it from the owner. U nderstand? Hey! How did you get th is pictu re? The Internet. The i nformation i nd icates that th is man owns the bu i ldi ng, si r. The defensive equ i pment was bu i lt when Kh u n Sa h id h i mself i n Bangkok.

We were tricked i nto comi ng here! Jenji ra is robbi ng the diamond ban k. There's a big fight there. The pol ice have barred entry i nto the bu i ldi ng. No reporters can get i n at th is ti me. Someth i ng's wrong. Why wou ld Suchat come and take it? Yos! Hel l ! Thei r real target is the treasu ry. Cool ! What a smooth operation ! Go! The system of th is model . . . has a control room over it. We must go i nside. . . and put bombs on the seven beams. If there's anyth i ng wrong, we must destroy the beams and let the explosion blow open the door. Get away from the door. I can manage it. Who's that? I heard you l i ke women . I want to test you out. That's wrong ! But go ahead, test me. Take the money on the plane now. Why are you doi ng th is? Betrayi ng me? Who betrayed whom? You th i n k I don't know? I i ntercepted you r cal ls with that special officer. You want to deceive me? Take al l the money and ru n? No matter how clever you are, you won't ever be as clever as me. Hey! Is everybody okay i n there? Put down the gu n . Want to get rich by robbi ng my cou ntry? Forget it. I need the money. Otherwise, my cou ntry wi l l die. How many are dead? The stolen money is on the plane, si r. Hey! Watch out! Boss! You ! Are you just l i ke the rest of them? I'm sorry. Everybody needs the money. Yeah ! Everybody needs it. Goodbye, Suah Kab Dab. Friends are more i mportant than money. Okay! Okay! There are on ly th ree of us now. Let's divide it i nto th i rds. We can fly away together to l ive ou r l ives as we want to. But I prefer my l ife l i ke th is. Hey! Th i n k it over. You'l l be a mi l l ionai re. You can have anyth i ng you want. Even an ideal ist l i ke Commander Kao Yod wants the money to trai n h is forces. Why are you doi ng th is? Why? I don't want to reti re with j ust a pension . I risked my l ife day i n, day out, and for what? You're the same. If you aren't ki l led before the end, you'l l be left old and useless just l i ke a dog waiti ng for the scraps from the table. Look at the bastards, getti ng richer and richer. Don't you see? Bel ieve me. Take the money. - I don't want that ki nd of money. - Wou ld you give me some? Suchat! You too? Of cou rse! I don't want to be weari ng sh itty clothes my whole l ife. You ! Al l of you ! I'm an ideal ist, anyway. How did you know it was me? Did you forget? Samorn is capable of fi ndi ng any i nformation . The smal lest cl ue is enough for her. The body of Commander Kao Yod isn't here, si r. Hey! You're gon na get pregnant. Look too long . I'm not a fish . Go! Goddamn it! We didn't get all the money! One sack is missing. Father! I regret taking the money. I needed it for Wieng Tai. But I guarantee there won't be a contempt of your country. And if you want my help, add some more n ines to the n umber, and you*re welcome. Un less it's absolutely necessary, I hope we never see each other again . Yos, that's the tape recorder. How come it's here? H i, Tiger Blade! Have a n ice vacation . And then maybe we can start over once again .
