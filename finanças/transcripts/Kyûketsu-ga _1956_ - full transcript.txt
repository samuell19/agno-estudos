Kyuketsu-ga (Vampire Moth) Good morning. Hey, good work. - Good morning. Welcome. Sensei, he's here. The other designer does quite a good job. No problem, Asaji-sensei will get the gold medal this time, too. Tohru What is it? Tohru, that white-haired old geezer is coming tonight, too. I hate that old geezer! He always looks at us with cynical eyes while smirking. That's right. Is he a spy from another association or something? He maybe wants to weaken us and weaken Sensei, too. You don't say. He is! Maybe even... She's suspicious, too. She was the no. 1 designer in Japanese Magazine until Sensei came back from France. And you had a problem with her in the past, didn't you? Stop joking. Well, she did get mad when she knew I became Asaji-sensei's student. Ah, it's our time! Ah, it's almost time, Lastly, we have a great designer who will perform herself, Please welcome, Asaji Fumio with her "Blue Rose". Murakoshi Did you come to see me? I have something to give to Asaji Fumio. What is it? Ah, this. I can deliver it to her, but what's your name? You'll know if you give this to her. I can't deliver this, I don't even know your name. Congratulations! Please, a word. Asaji-san, Congratulations. It seems the Gold goes to you again this time. Really? See you later. Sensei What is it? There's a man who told me to give this to you. Who was it? He was a creepy guy. I wonder what's inside? Please open it. Oh my. Sensei? What's wrong? The Gold medal for today's contest goes to Asaji Fumio's "Seven Flower". Asaji is not feeling well, so Miss Kayoko will take her place in the ceremony. That woman's design piece... I see no originality there. The Silver medal goes to Kusaka Tazuko. Everybody, let's cheers. Congratulations! It's good. Congratulations! It's a shame that I have to leave at such a good moment, But I have someone to meet. Please excuse me. Please, enjoy yourselves. Just have fun. Tohru, he was so terrifying, right? That wolf-like man. I saw him because I was going down from the stage. Please don't tell anyone about that. That apple must have been bitten by that man. Sensei... Please rest at once. Yeah, how about a nap? Yes. - Yes, you should. I will. Please excuse me. Good night. - Good night. But that man is so wonderful, right? Hey, Tohru. I can't stop thinking that the wolf man is related to that white-haired old man. What's with this Wolf man? I've told you not to talk about that. It's scary. Please excuse me. If you rest tight tonight, you'll be better by tomorrow. Good night. Ah, it's so scary... But Kayoko, is that true? Why would I lie? It's really a man with wolf fangs. That's strange. But I don't think that old man is involved. I know that person's background. Well, he's a weird one but he's known as an insect researcher. He's also known for his research on moths. His address is on Musashi-Koganei Street. Who is it? I want to see the person who just entered this house. I'm sorry, our sensei is not in good health and still needs to rest. So Sensei hasn't gotten better since last night? She's in a foul mood this morning, too. Strange why she just changed after she saw that bitten apple. Hey. I remember, in the shower room with her... I saw the same mark like the apple on her chest. Sensei, a letter for you. 'Dont forget your promise. 9PM tonight at Ueno Park' Yes, I understand. I'll tell her later, thanks. I'm troubled. Who was that? It's a person who just came back from France. He got a present from Sensei's friend. He wanted to deliver it directly but... Sensei is currently not in good health, so we can't let her go. That person doesn't know Sensei, right? Then someone can just go and tell him she's Asaji Fumio. You're right, What about that, Tohru? Well. Who will go, then? I'm the one said that, so I'll go. Where's the person? He's in Tokai Hotel, Room 303. The name is Nishimura. Well, I'm going now. Wait. Are you okay? - About what? Don't worry, I'm good at acting. Get home soon! We'll wait! Who's there? It's me. I heard you're still sick. You push yourself too much. Papa. I was waiting for you. Wait... are you Asaji Fumio? - Yes. Please, come. This. Ah, I thought you were waiting in the room. Yes, but then I went out too. Well, it's time for me to go home. Already? Please stay. I have a meeting with clients tonight. 100000 Yen, isn't it? Thanks, as always. I don't want to talk about this, but you've used a lot of money lately. It can't be helped, Papa. This kind of job requires a lot of money. I understand that. But... Maybe telling you to stop being a designer is the same as telling you to die. I just want you to know that I love you. The person sitting in this bed. Not the number 1 designer in Japan. I know... Thank you, Papa. Well, good night. You'll be better tomorrow. Kayoko is late. Hey Did you bring what was promised? What are you doing? If you don't hand it over, I'll publish what's on this paper. You understand? Your career as a designer will collapse at once! Hello, is this Tokai Hotel? I want to talk to Nishimura, Room 303. Huh? What? How is it, Torhu? They said Room 303 is empty. How about Kayoko? I'll go to the hotel. I heard Asaji's health is not good. What's wrong with you guys? Kawase, Kayoko has gone out and hasn't come back. It's only 9:30 PM, she's no longer a child. We found out that the phone call was fake. Sensei is the one who called, but Kayoko went in her place. Did the caller know Asaji? No. We didn't want to make him worry. I see. Then I'll go see Asaji first. But, Kawase. It's okay, I won't say anything to upset her. Yumi, come with me to the medical office. Terrifying! The bite scar... Hey, What's this? It wasn't sent to Asaji yet? We sent Asaji's this morning. Here, look. Then what is this? Hello? Mannequin box? Ah, from the supplier. Yes, it has been sent. What is it? You surprised me. Blood! Blood! Kayoko! Call the police! Tell Madam. Hello, hello! Madam, Madam. What the hell. Take care of her. Sensei, Sensei! What is it, Kawase? Tell me, tell me. Didn't someone go out from here? No, what happened? Tell me. Madam got hurt by the Wolf man! Ah, what is that? "To: Asaji, Fashion Model Association" It's sent to our name. I wonder what it is. Who brought this? You didn't see, Tohru? But you're always here, right? Yes, but I stepped out for a moment. Then someone put it there when you were out... frightening. No! I'm afraid that's the same apple. It's so light. You guys are being too paranoid. Then open it, Kawase. Okay. A butterfly? It says 'Kazuko' on it. Maybe Arima Kazuko? Why hasn't Arima come? Hello, is this Asahi Apartments? Is Arima Kazuko there? Eh? She hasn't come home yet? I see. Please tell her to call me when she's home. Yumi, come. Welcome. Two coffees. Do you know what this is? It's burned. What is it? I collected it from Asaji's hearth. Is there something strange? Well... it's the 'Blue Rose' design, the one she wore at the fashion show. But it's not her handwriting. It's more like a man's writing. I'm Todoroki, the police inspector. I want to ask you about the mannequins sent to Asaji Association in Roppongi. It's mistaken with other goods with no sender, strangely. And the one that hadn't been sent? Ah, here. I have something to do tonight, so I can't take you home. Where are you going? Musashi-Koganel. About the butterfly, I think I know who would collect that kind of moth. Right, the white-haired old man. I think I can get some clues if I talk to him. Can't I go with you? I'm so scared being alone. The repairer here said that he remembered something odd happened yesterday. Yes, there was a man who wanted to repalr the arms of his mannequin. He brought a wooden box. In the middle of our conversation, he made a call and then he left with the box. I think he didn't want to make the person wait, but I also thought he was rushing. What did he look like? He wore a black coat wlth standing collar and dark glasses. Here, this is Eto Shunsaku's house. Watch yourself! - I'm sorry. Kawase Huh? This is blood? It's blood. What happened? When that man bumped me... Kawase, I'm so afraid. I'm here with you. We can't just leave after getting here now, right? Who's there? I'm from the newspaper company, I have someting to ask you. What? Newspaper? What brings you here? I prefer not so speak through a door. Please open up. What do you want? We bumped into two susplcious men bringing something from your house. Then look, there's blood on her coat because of it. So what? Did something happen in your house? No, nothing. Leave! I know he's a weird old man but, I think he lives with his maid, so I doubt he murders people. I'm not saying he's a murderer. But look at this blood. Darn, maybe he escaped. Who is that? Hey, it's the maid. You're the maid of Eto's house, right? Where's your master? He was home before. Wait here. Master. Master... There's patrol in front of the house. He's gone out. Let's check inside. But, he's not there. No problem, the maid is there. Well, then... I see. It's so splendid. It's Arima Kazuko's clothes! Yumi! Yumi! Yes, I'll arrange it soon. There's a report from patrol about the murder cases, He found a corpse. The victim is a fashion model. Fashion model? - Yes. The name is Arima Kazuko. Is that so? Inspector, is this...? Yes. According to the maid, Mr. Eto dug this in the morning. He said it was for the fallen leaves. The culprit wanted to hide the corpse. I wonder... Who's there? Kindaichi, you came. I called him. I see, but we won't need detective Kosuke Kindaichi for this case. The culprit is obvious. It's this housemaster, Eto Shunsaku. We just wait for him to be arrested. I don't think so. What do you mean? The corpse of Arima Kazuko... the culprit wanted to hide it. You said it, inspector. Of course, this hole, and the way he cut limbs off the corpse. But Takita Kayoko's corpse, The culprit risked sending it to Asaji Association instead. It seems he wants to cause terror, but now... Kindaichi, so you're saying that each case is a different culprit? No. I just can't help thinking about this contradiction. Kawase Huh? Kindaichi, Inspector, please come. Here. What is this? When the fashion show concluded, It was the design that took the Silver medal. Who's the designer? Kusaka Tazuko, the rival of our Asaji Fumio. I see a clue about this case. Kusaka Tazuko I want to ask some questions. Do you know a man named Eto Shunsaku? Eto? Yes, He's a moth scholar in Koganei. I don't know him. Frankly speaking... We will show you evidence instead of explaining the condition. You, bring that. This is the evidence. Do you know this design? Let's see... Yes, I do. This is my stolen and modified design. Maybe you don't know, but... We can't be careless in the fashion world. The stealing of designs happens often. There are people who steal others' designs and claim them. This is my design that got the silver medal in the Fall Tokyo fashion Show competition. Where did you get this? It was in Eto Shunsaku's moth storage. Well... In the end, people who steal others' designs won't last long. Is thls Kawase? If you want to know what happened to Arima's leg, go to Asakusa stage. Asakusa stage? Hello, hello! Hey, what happened? You got dumped by your girlfriend? I'm going out. Yumi, what are you doing? I... I'm so afraid going out by myself. You fool... It's more dangerous if you're outside like this! Where are you going? Asakusa, are you coming? Yes. Hey, there are a lot of people here. Is something going to happen? Well... Let's just wait. 'IN PUBLIC CHALLENGE TO POLICE... POLICE HAVE NO COUNTER-MEASURE' 'HUMAN LEGS DANCING ON STAGE' The wolf man case is getting darker, right? Well, we still don't know who the wolf man is, and Eto Shunsaku is a fugitive now. We have no clue. I think Asaji Fumio may know about the Wolf man. Asaji does? I reckon she was blackmailed. Yeah... but she's been sick and doesn't want to talk to us. Yes, he's there. Inspector, it's Nagaoka. Nagaoka? - Yes. Hello. Yes, ah, you're at Asaji's. Well, if we can meet... Huh? We'll go there soon. I'm glad we are waiting for Kindaichi, Asaji's husband told me she knows something about the Wolf man. Yes. You coming? Okay, I'll go too. I know this is strange, but do you know that in France, theres an urban legend of possession by wolf? It's a similar phenomenon with the fox possession in Japan. If you get bit by a wolf at full moon, you'll be possessed by a wolf. You'll lose your mind, and start craving human flesh, and your teeth will sharpen as a wolf. I studied in Paris from 1951 until 1953. and I resided with a man named Ibuki Tetsuzou for a while. Then I realized Ibuki Tetsuzou was maybe not his real name... Or his nationality. - So, he's not Japanese? No, he's absolutely Japanese. He had a criminal past and fleed Japan. His status is: Dead. When I learned that, he became more violent. We went to Switzerland for vacation that winter. Darling, what happened? The next morning, he was himself again. I was so afraid and thought I needed to get away from him. Then, you left him and came back? No, it was not necessary, Because he ended up getting lost in Spain where we went on vacation. Hmm. Spain. He was lost in the Pyrenees Mountains, near Saint Lavia. The rescue team thought he was eaten by wolves. Locals said that he went with the wolves because of his possession. I then went back to Paris, and then back to Japan 2 months later. I'm sorry, but what is Ibuki's occupation? He draws abstract pictures. So he's an artist? Does he make designs, too? No, not at all. But why? Nothing. Please continue your story. Then I thought I cut all ties with him. I forgot about him, and live happily. ...but in May, this year, he suddenly contacted me again. Why? I don't know, he told me to go back to France, but I refused. I wonder if he had white hair... No, it was pitch black. And then? After that, he called me several times. You answered all of them? Just once. From his apartment. Apartment? Where's the apartment? Narukozaka, behind Futaba Pharmacy. Ibuki, welcome home. Greetings. - You've been out? Yes. - I see, good night. So, this is your hideout? This is my brother's hideout. Huh? Your little brother? Hmm? Your hair is white. It was black back then. Please don't tease us like this. Why did you do something like that last time? You called us, right? Call? Yes, You told us to shock the public, and you commanded us to make the legs dance on the stage. Here's your money for the previous work. Thanks. Next, I want you to... find my brother. My twin brother. The one who commanded you to kidnap women wasn't me. It was him. My brother murders people. He might do that again tonight. So we have to find him, and drive him away abroad. So, you're not the one killed that woman? When I came back to my storage, she had already been killed. I realized it was my brother. When I was attempting to bury her, you guys came. You have to thank us. The police dug that hole again after that. You almost got caught. Damn it! Damn it! Did Ibuki dye his hair? It was white. What are you saying? I met him when he came back. His hair was black as usual. This design comes with a simple line, and succeeds to make the wearer look stunning. Compare this design with the one that model's using. Model is Tayama Yoshiko, Designer is Kusaka Tazuko. That dress uses this design for the base. You sure? Yes, I see some similarities. Okay, thank you. Tami, do your best substituting for Sensei, okay? Really, be calm and do your best. It's time, Tami. Do your best! Pardon, please stand by backstage. Hello. - Hi. Do your best, okay? The design we found in Eto's storage... We believed you when you told us it was the stolen one. What do you mean? This one, we found it in another place. Another place? Narukozaka, Futaba Apartments, It was in Ibuki Tetsuzou's room. Nonsense... This design wouldn't be at that apartment. And now from the host, Asaji Association. It's designed by Asaji Fumio, the model is Kadono Tamiko. Don't ask me, dont ask me! I don't know anything. Inspector Kindaichi, It's the wolf man again! You! You! Who was the last with her? I think it was Asaji's manager. Hey, What happened? Pull yourself together! He received a heavy blow. Inspector, Kusaka Tazuko is... Her also? Kindaichi He got us. I didn't think he'd go this far. Hey. You're Asaji Fumio, right? You brought what was promised? You! Why did you have my design? I bought it from Ibuki Tetsuzou. As long as you use that design, I have rights to take royalties from you. The money! Ah, is this... Hurry, give me that! Or you don't want this envelope? Please show me your left hand once again. And show me that wristwatch. You! You! Fumio! Hey. Who the hell are you? I am... Todoroki, it's the wolf again! He kidnapped our girls! Wolf? Who? The fashion models, three of them. Three? How? I thought the Wolf man would target the others, too. So I told the three to stay at the apartment, and no going out. Then how... Huh? Okay, I see. Inspector, there's a report of murder in Ueno Park. From his belongings, we know the name of the victim, It's Nagaoka Shuji. Nagaoka Shuji? Who are you? Asaji, correct? Why are you here now? You've been called by someone. So, the person who called you will come also? Who's there? You! You're Tetsuzou! Have you lost your mind? How many days have we been here? Three, no four. What will happen to us? We will get killed? No! Hey, it's food time. I heard that out of 4 models, 3 of them are kidnapped I also heard the well-known detective, Kindaichi Kosuke has disappeared, too. Currently, all I can say is the investigation is in progress. Is it really progressing? Anyway, please leave for now. I'll contact you if there's something to announce. Hey, check this. Tohru, the Wolf man... Huh? Really? Okay, I see! I'll arrange it soon! Prepare yourself! Hello, hello. What do you want from me? I'll get you 3 women. No you won't. Who's there!? Who the hell are you? Ibuki Tetsuzou Liar! You're about to say Ibuki was murdered, right? Kindaichi... Then, the one who came into my room... It's me. We already knew that you buried Ibuki Tetsuzou in the hole and the police found it. Ibuki called Fumio to the moth storage to assault her, but he was killed by Fumio instead. You saw that and threatened Fumio for money. To make Fumio not seem suspicious, you made up the story that Ibuki is alive, and that he is the one who blackmailed Fumio. You also kidnapped Kayoko and killed her. You learned Fumio's weakness, then, you could use her as you wish. You also disguised as a Wolf man so you wouldn't be suspicious. Then you had to kill Kusaka Tazuko, too. The other 2 models, too! You became an evil beast who sucks blood! You also killed Nagaoka. Nagaoka wanted to stop Fumio's career as a designer because she's suffering for it. Then, you killed Eto Sunsaku, too! That way you can make the case disappear with him. Your name is. The Killer. Murakosh Tohru! Kindaichi, you're such an excellent detective! You've unmasked me! Let's go! Hurry. Hey! Hurry up. Go! Fast! END
