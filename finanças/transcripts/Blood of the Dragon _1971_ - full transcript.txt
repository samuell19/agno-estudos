Pity a poor blind orphan, sir. A few coins, sir? Please have pity, please have pity. Pity a poor blind orphan, just a few coins for food. Coins for an orphan, please? Please sir, have pity. - No, no. (chuckles) Anything but money, you know how I am about that. We can negotiate later. Bye bye. - [Man] Master Zhou, Master Zhou. - [Boy] Have pity, sir. A few coins for the blind beggar. Please sir? - Damned beggar, get out! - Uh, uh, have pity, sir. Be kind to me and your sons will live. - Hmm, insult me? How dare you! Get out of here. (chuckles) - You pay me, then I'll stop. Besides, why do you want so much money? You can't take it with you. - Oh, I'll give it to you like this! Whoa! (boy laughing) I'll kill you! You little, you! Ah! (man groaning) Where? (man groaning) Where is he? I'll kill him. Where? Wait, where did he go? Did anyone see him? Where did that fellow go? Where is he? I'll pay a reward, where is he? Oh, if I catch him.

(groans) (boy shouts) Wait! - I'm blind! Help! I'm blind, I can't see anything! - Go inside, look. I have money for you. - Huh, money? - Please, it's very important. Take this to young prince of Peiping Palace. His name, Ma Tang. You got that? Ma Tang. Please. This is my dying wish. Deliver this, deliver this to the young prince.

Did you steal that money? - [Man] The money. - No, honest. This man in the alley, he gave it to me, and then, then he fell over dead. - Ni Chiu, you're fibbing again. - [Man] It's already done. - It's the truth, I'm not lying to you, believe me, and he gave me a bamboo too. - [Kang Fu] Bamboo too? - [Man] I'm coming! I'm coming, all right? - Come on in, what can I do to help you? Can I get you-- (Miss Yen gasps) - Look out. - Come in, come in, sir. - [Kang Fu] Move. - [Man] My goodness, me. - Give me that tube! - What's going on here? - Sir, please, please. - [Miss Yen] What are you doing? Stop him, get away! - [Man] Just wait, just a moment. (glasses shattering) (people chatting) - Stop it. - Come on. - [Man] Just stop it. (gasps) - Hey, are you crazy? Picking on women and children like this. - I won't give it to you. (people chatting) - [Kang Fu] Come on. - Ni Chiu, Ni Chiu! (Ni Chiu panting) (Ni Chiu shouting) - [Miss Yen] Let him go, let him go! - Where do you think you're going, you little brat? - Boy. You leave him alone!

(shouts) (gasps) All right, I'll give it to you, but you have to stop hurting Miss Yen!

(dramatic music) - Who are you? - Nevermind, just give it back. Return what you took. - What? Not on your life!

What is your name? - I know you. You're the Premier's guard, Fidri Kang Fu. - That's my name. (spits) - Traitor!

Or do you two cowards wanna keep this up? (suspenseful music) - Where's my money? - Give it, give it. (groans) (dramatic music) (weapon clatters) - Ha, well, well. If it isn't the little blind beggar. - I fooled you. You gave me 20 coins once. - Those two are the worst dogs in the Prime Minister's Guard. Why did they take this from you? - It doesn't belong to me. I got it from a man behind the teahouse, just before he died. He told me to take it some man in the palace for him. - It's your duty then to carry out his wish. Take it. - Uh, Mr. Lung? Wait just a moment, please. What do you think could be in that bamboo tube that so many people are after? And how will Ni Chiu handle them? - Well, maybe I can't fight, but I can run fast. - Is that so? Well, you didn't do too well just now. - Well, anyway, you are lucky I was there to protect you. - Who is that tube for anyway? - For a young prince whose name is Ma Tang. - Okay, come on. I'll go to the palace with you. - I'll be right back, don't worry about us, Miss Yen! (bright instrumental music) (Miss Yen laughs) - I'm not worried now. - You were really good, two against one, you still beat 'em! Will you be my teacher? Will you take me as your pupil? - A man in my business gets into a lot of trouble. - [Ni Chiu] It sure beats gettin' pushed around. (water splashing) It's so hot, I don't feel like going. - What's that? (Ni Chiu chuckles) - [Ni Chiu] I was only joking. - Ni Chiu, now you listen to me. When you take on a job, you must finish it. - I know a proverb. Accept no task unless... Hm, I can't remember the rest. (laughs) - You're equal to the burden. - Yeah. Yeah, you're a real knight. (sighs) - I am no knight. - [Ni Chiu] What do you think could be inside the tube? It's so light, it couldn't be worth very much. - Oh, really? We know at least one man who has died for this. Come on, jump up. Ni Chiu. - Huh? - Did he say where in the palace this young man lives? - No, just a palace. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Your Highness? - Your Highness, we waited outside the town, but Brother Yang never got there. - We saw Kang Fu and one other guard. They both looked injured, like they ran into trouble. - Ah, Fidri Kang Fu in town? - We followed them through town. They're staying at the Inn of the Flaming Serpent. - There are many Mongols there. I am sure I saw the deserter they call the Gold Leopard, and I also saw the Prime Minister Sing Pa Tou. - You had it. Had you lost it? The Emperor ordered us to get the list of the names and the meeting places of the Young Rebels, and now you tell me some little boy stole it from you? - Not a little boy, it was a warrior. Look! - So. Who did that to you? - I never saw him before. He uses a spear. He's very fast and he's very good, that's all I know. - Could it be the man who is known as the White Dragon? He is a lone wolf with many enemies. His name is Lung Ti. - That's him, it was the White Dragon! - Where is he now? - He's at a teahouse. It's about five miles from here. - Gold Leopard? - [Gold Leopard] Yes, sir. - Take some men to the inn and keep this White Dragon busy. I'll be along later to teach him a lesson. - [Gold Leopard] Yes, sir. - Is it true? General Tai is coming? - Hmm, Tai is the greatest swordsman in the Emperor's army. He will take on only the most important missions. (dramatic synth music) - Sir, ah! - Take him, get him out of town and kill him. (man whimpering) - No, no, no! No, oh, oh, spare me! Spare me, spare me! - Prime Minister. - What's happening in town? - Prime Minister, the men at the Palace of Ma Tang seem very upset. There has been a great deal of activity there, and everyone seems concerned because Yang has not yet arrived. - Ma Tang, is the rebel leader Ma Tang? - What is it? - A boy and a man are here to see you. - Why are you here? - Are you the Chinese prince? Ma Tang? - Ha, Lung Ti, so it's you. What do you want of me? - You recognize me? - Why shouldn't I when you murdered my father? - I can't remember all the men I have killed. I am sorry. - Hmm, is that so? Maybe you'll remember this! (dramatic music) (weapons clanging) (weapons clanging) - You're Ma Chin's son. - So now you remember. My father died of shame after you defeated and laughed at him, and you didn't even know he was dead till now! (sighs) - When you live the kind of life I lead, you try to forget. - I haven't, I remember. Now you'll never forget it! - Hold it, hold it. I didn't come to fight. (weapons whooshing) (men grunting) (shouting) - Stop fighting, stop fighting! We came to deliver something. (weapons clanging) (men grunting) - Young Master, Young Master! (Lung Ti shouting) Hold back. - Mr. Lung? - Let's go. (shouts) (weapons clanging) (men groaning) (wood clattering) (dramatic music) (light piano music) - Ha, Lung Ti, you're no match for my magic sword. - Ha, treacherous weapons do not make brave men. (sword clattering) - Hmm, you're clever with words. I'll still kill you. - I may have dueled with your father, but I did not kill him. - Hmm, pleading won't help you now, fool! - Hm. Ni Chiu. - [Ni Chiu] Huh? - Does it sound like I'm pleading? - Never, you'd never plead, Master Lung. (laughing) (spear whooshing) (Lung Ti grunts) (men grunting) (heart beating) Blood, you're bleeding! - Ni Chiu, hop up, get on my back. - Don't worry about me, I can run fast enough. - You don't understand. Get up there, press my wound to stop the blood. - I. I. - Hurry! Hop up on my back, quick! (Ni Chiu groaning) (shouting) (weapons clanging) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (men shouting) (Lung Ti shouts) (spear whooshing) (Lung Ti shouts) - Huh, he got away. Now that he knows my sword's secret, I'll have a hard time killing him. - Young Master, we have such dangerous business. You must forget your own personal vengeance. - I. (horse galloping) - Chief, Young Master. - We'll talk inside. - [Man] Right. - Bar the door. (door creaks) And Brother Yang? - He died in Peiping, and Mrs. Yang was murdered on the way here too. - And what happened to the bamboo tube? - It wasn't on the bodies. - I, the Emperor's men could have it now. (water splashing) - Still bleeding? - It's much better now. Mr. Lung, are you gonna die? - Ha, I don't have time to die right now. (bamboo clattering) - Ma Tang can't have this, not after he stabbed you in the back. (Ni Chiu shouts) Mr. Lung, you? - Ni Chiu, I'm sorry. You know, I've never apologized before to anyone, for anything. I guess I never really wanted to. I've been too proud. - Why? Why did you push me? - Because I, I, because I want Ma Tang to have this list. - After what he did to you? He's a horrible man! I wanna stab him in the back. - You're wrong, he's a true patriot. - A patriot? - Yes. For years, the Mongols have been tyrannizing our country, taking our lands and treating us like their slaves. But now the people have had enough, now they are going to fight back. - Ma Tang hasn't fought any battles. - His job is even more dangerous. He is the leader of those who are protesting. His name is on the top of this list. The Emperor wants to get this list very badly. Many good men have died protecting these names. Ma Tang is risking his life every day. - You don't mean that. You're acting like Ma Tang is a good friend of yours. - Ni Chiu, now you listen to me! You don't want to be a beggar all your life. You have a duty to perform for your country. You agreed to deliver this list to the palace. Is that burden too great for the task? - But you could beat him. - Well, now I know the secret of his magic sword. Besides, I could take 50 men like him. - [Ni Chiu] Then? - He's risking his life for his country. Now, what's a small wound compared to that? Ow. (Lung Ti groaning) (Lung Ti breathing heavily) Ni Chiu, where can we go to get a little rest? - Yeah, Miss Yen's teahouse. We can go there. - Let me. Here, let me pour for you. There you go. Thank you, thank you! (wood clatters) - All of you get out, I'm taking over! - Go, get out! (people shouting) - Hi there, why don't you and I go into the backroom? (men laughing) - What do you want? - Huh? We are tracking down traitors to the Emperor. (crowd chattering) - Wait. Hold it, hold it, hold it. You haven't paid your bill yet! No, hold it, hold it! Oh, oh! - Since when is selling wine a crime? - Don't get smart with me. Just keep your place. We're waiting here. - [Miss Yen] All right, go ahead and wait. - Oh no! Ah, ah, ah. - What are you doing? - Oh, just standing here, waiting for you to keep me company, huh? - I'll stay here if you don't mind losing all your teeth. - You smart aleck, you'd better watch your lip! (vases clattering) - Oh, Miss Yen, Miss Yen! - No! - Oh! (men laughing) (laughing) (vase shatters) - Stop. Be quiet, you want to scare the White Dragon out of here? And you, you sit down and stay put. - Li, you're not needed here, so you go home and get some sleep. - Miss Yen, Miss Yen, you. - Li, go on. I'll be all right here. Don't worry about me. - Okay. Miss Yen. I'll be off now. - Get out! - Oh no! - Well, go out and look around. See if Lung is coming. (twinkling music) - Young Master, we just saw Pa Tou. The Prime Minister hurried away from the Inn of the Flaming Serpent. - Huh, which way did he go? - We followed them to the edge of town. I heard him mention the White Dragon. - Master, I recognized the beggar boy who was with the White Dragon. He lives with Miss Yen at the teahouse just outside of town. - Hmm, Lung Ti is not political. Normally, he would not get involved in this. The boy said they had something to deliver. Could it be they have the list? It is possible, huh? - Look, if they had the tube, we'd be arrested by now. I'm gonna follow the Prime Minister and Kang Fu. - Yeah, prepare mounts! (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) (men shouting) (horses whinnying) - [Pa Tou] Ah, it's Tai. What is your mission here? - General Tai, the Emperor ordered me to kill everyone on the rebel list, and I intend to do so before I leave here. No one will be left alive. Pa Tou, did you get it? - Uh, not yet. - [Kang Fu] What's that? - Hmm? - Sir, we took it from Yang, but then Lung Ti, the White Dragon, stepped in and took it away from us. - What? - He not only grabbed the list, look what he did to my hand! - Come here. - [Kang Fu] Sir? General? (Tai shouts) - You idiot, where is the White Dragon now? - He's at a teahouse a few miles from Peiping. - Who was Yang taking the list to in Peiping? - [Tai] We believe the leader of the rebels is the young prince, Ma Tang. - Hmm, he's the son of Chin Sha, the man with the magic sword. Years ago, Chin Sha lost a duel with the White Dragon and killed himself out of shame. Lung Ti and Ma Tang must be enemies now. - Interesting. Lung Ti and Ma Tang may kill each other. - Hmm, quite so. Lung Ti the White Dragon leaves enemies wherever he goes. I'll go after Ma Tang first, then get rid of Lung Ti. That will end this rebellion. (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) (horse galloping) - [Ni Chiu] Hey, why stop here? - [Lung Ti] This is where we fought the Emperor's guards this morning. They may be waiting again. (suspenseful music) (horse galloping) - [Kang Fu] Hey, look! There's a horse over there. - [Pa Tou] Hmm, we've got company. - [Tai] Let's go. (weapons scraping) (men shouting) (weapons clanging) (spear whooshing) (spear whooshing) (dramatic music) (Lung Ti breathing heavily) - Roast in hell! (suspenseful music) - Hi, Miss Yen. I'm glad it's so quiet here. Master Lung thought there'd be soldiers. - Hush! Hush. - You, you're the beggar. - No, no, no, I'm not. - Go. - [Ni Chiu] Quit it! - Let him go! Stop picking on him, bully! - Be quiet. You keep out of this or I'll kill him. All right, where can I find Lung? (groaning) - I don't know, I don't even know him. (groaning) - Let him go! Please let him go, ah! - Go away. - Miss Yen! Lung Ti wasn't even with me! - Listen here, I just wanna talk to him. Why is he hiding from me? What is he, a coward? - [Lung Ti] Who says I'm hiding? (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (ceramic clattering) (dishes clattering) (spear whooshing) (gasps) - Guards, come in here! - Forget it, they can't help you. They're all dead. (spear whooshing) (men grunting) (dishes clattering) (Gold Leopard groaning) (spear whooshing) (dramatic music) (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) - [Gold Leopard] Master Fu! - [Pa Tou] Well? (horse whinnies) - [Gold Leopard] The White Dragon is inside there. - You haven't killed him? - I, I'm just not his match. He's already killed the men that were with me, Prime Minister. - Ha, I'm not afraid of him! - [Gold Leopard] Prime Minister, Prime Minister! - [Pa Tou] Lung Ti, come on out of here! Come out, Lung Ti! (knocking on door) Lung Ti, you hear me? Come out here! (Lung Ti groaning) Lung Ti. You yellow dog, come out! - Ni Chiu. Get my spear. - [Pa Tou] White Dragon, come out! Come out if you dare! (groaning) (knocking on door) Lung Ti, get out here! - I'm right here, come on in, bastard! - You're hurt. You can break out. There's no one at the backdoor. You can get away easily now. - I can't run. Facing trouble is the best way. There's no backing off for me. Those men must be stopped. - Lung, get out here! (knocking on door) - Ni Chiu, open the door. Miss Yen, bring me wine. (knocking on door) (ceramic shatters) (weapons clanging) (men shouting) (dishes shatter) - [Pa Tou] Am I hurt badly? How bad is it? (Lung Ti breathing heavily) - If it weren't for my wound, they'd all be dead. - [Pa Tou] Am I hurt badly? Is it a bad wound? - [Kang Fu] Not bad, it's only superficial. (Pa Tou coughing) - [Pa Tou] Damn it. (Pa Tou groans) I underestimated him. - Look, Pa Tou, only Tai can handle him. - It's strange, why does he stay inside? Something's funny. I'll go check the roof. - Hey, be careful! (suspenseful music) (exhales) - Wine. (wind howling) - [Pa Tou] Dead. Well, that settles that. We'd better wait here for Tai. - [Kang Fu] What if he comes outside? - Look here, none of us is his match. I'll go around to the back. At least I can keep him from getting away. - I wonder what's the matter. Where's General Tai? (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) (lively rock music) - Master Lung, you can't go on like this. Let me get a doctor. - It's no good, you can't get out. - If I don't do something, then you may die. - Miss Yen? I'll go! - Don't be stupid. - Master Lung, let Ni Chiu go. He's very clever, and in the darkness, he can slip by them. You will die without a doctor. This is his chance to help you, hmm? - You were right, I have a task. I don't want to be a beggar all my life. This is the burden that I can carry. (bright acoustic guitar music) ♪ Hmm ♪ Hmm (suspenseful music) (wind howling) (ominous music) - Ah, a ghost! (panting) - Where do you think you're going, huh? (laughs) - Huh? Oh, it's you. What happened? Did you grow your finger back already? - Hmm, if you mention my finger again, I'll hold you up by your hair and cut off all yours. You hear me? - [Ni Chiu] Okay, I won't say another thing. - [Kang Fu] Hey, where are you going? - To see Master Lung. - Oh, he's not inside there? - Uh, uh, he went into town. - [Kang Fu] Oh, town? Hey, hold it! You're just a little too tricky, and you're also full of lies too, you little son-- - Give me 20 crowns of silver and I'll steal the bamboo tube for you tonight. - If you can get it for me, you've got a deal. - [Ni Chiu] Okay, but I know the place, so you'd better let me lead the way. (suspenseful music) - [Kang Fu] Hey, why are we taking so long to get there? - [Ni Chiu] Just be patient. - When we get there, you go inside and get the tube for me, and no tricks, I'll be right outside. - Sure. - I'll pay you when you deliver the tube. Just remember, if you do anything stupid, you'll be very sorry. (horse galloping) - Ma Tang? (Ni Chiu screaming) (weapons whooshing) (men grunting) (metal clanging) (weapons whooshing) (metal clanging) (gasps) (weapons whooshing) (fire crackling) (weapon whooshing) (Kang Fu groaning) - Come on out. It's all right, he's dead. - It's, it's okay. I'm not afraid. - You're the beggar boy with Lung. Where is he now? - He's wounded. You stabbed him in the back. I came to get a doctor for him. - Hmm, just as well if he dies. - You coward, you coward! You stabbed him in the back! (Ni Chiu whimpering) I really was trying to take you for a hero, and so was he, you dog! - What's that? Lung Ti thinks that I'm a hero? - He told me it was my duty to deliver something to you, and when we got there, you stabbed him in the back! - Look here, what did you bring me? - A bamboo tube, a dying man gave it to me, in the alley down there. - Tell me, where's the bamboo tube now? - Master Lung has it. He read the list and said it's very important, and admired you for being a true patriot. Now let me go! He needs some medicine. - Don't bother, I'll help. I have some medicine that will take care of his wound. - I don't believe you. You'll just hurt him again! - Don't worry, so I was wrong. Can't a man make a mistake? - Will your medicine really work? - The medicine I have will never fail. - Let's hurry then! - Damn it. (wind howling) If he won't come out, burn him out! Go on! - Pa Tou, the Emperor ordered us to get the list. If we burn the house down, then. (Pa Tou sighs) - [Pa Tou] Get me more men. Get the best that we have. Go on, quick! - [Man] Sir. (horse galloping) (riding bells jingling) (horse whinnies distantly) (soothing instrumental music) (water splashing) (horse whinnies distantly) - Lung, please go. (wind howling) - There. Let's go in. Miss Yen! - [Miss Yen] Ni Chiu. (dramatic music) (horses galloping distantly) (horse whinnies distantly) (horse whinnies distantly) - You came to bring medicine. Show it to him. - I'll be proud to if Master Lung will accept it. (horse whinnies distantly) - Come. - Get me a basin of water. (Ni Chiu gasps) (fabric tearing) (Lung Ti groaning) (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) - Now listen to me. Anyone who leaves this house must be killed, and I mean anyone. You hear? (men shouting) Fine, now once General Tai arrives, we'll go in and get all of them. (men shouting) (horses whinnying) - [Man] Open the door! (men shouting) - I know why they're waiting. Tai is coming. - Who? - General Tai. - The Red Wolf? - General Tai and my father were once very close friends. Then Tai deserted to the Mongols, and my father rejected him. Last night, I saw the Red Wolf near here on the main road into Peiping. - Tai is their best man. - He'll set out to kill me first. Then he'll try to kill you too. He wants that list. Ah, he'll kill us all and stop the revolt. You must watch out for all of Tai's treacherous weapons. The sword that becomes a whip and spurs, which he throws with deadly aim. - So, I haven't lost too much blood. I think that I can take him. - Lung, well, I. - What is past is past. You wanted to redeem the name of your courageous father. That was an honorable thing for you to do. So now, forget it. - I'm so ashamed. - It's forgotten. - I'll go take them on, before Tai arrives. - It's no use. All your plans are doomed, as long as General Tai lives. - It's dawn. Such a long night. (horses galloping) (riding bells jingling) - [Man] Open the door! (men shouting) - There are more men, and the one riding in front is dressed in a bright red cloak. (horses whinnying) - Ma Tang, I'm going to give your list of names to Miss Yen. - To me? - They're after us. They won't suspect you. When I take on General Tai, you can get out with Ni Chiu and Miss Yen. Go back to the palace. - No, I won't! I can't leave you here by yourself, I'm- - Look, you've got to be sensible. Your own life has little meaning now. But if they should get their hands on this list of yours, then all your friends will be killed by Tai. (horse whinnies distantly) (horses galloping distantly) - Miss Yen! - A man must do what he must do. (suspenseful music) (men shouting) - [Man] Fight, fight! - [Man] Come out, let's fight! - [Man] Fight! - [Man] Fight! (dramatic music) - Red Wolf, he's wounded. (chuckles) - White Dragon, I've never known you to meddle before in your life. Why start now? - Heh. I'm not meddling. It's just too good a fight to pass up. - Ha. You're hurt, you haven't got a chance. - Hm. Well, you'll have to get me before you get this. (dramatic music) (men groaning) (spear whooshing) (weapons clanging) (men shouting) (men grunting) (spear whooshing) - I'm staying here with Master Lung. - [Ma Tang] Ni Chiu! - I'll stay too. If we did go, we'd be, why, we'd just be a burden. - Then I. - Go quickly. - If I had any choice, I'd rather stay behind and die with him. - Die? (dramatic music) (weapons clanging) (spear whooshing) - Hm. (men shouting) (metal clanging) (spear whooshing) (spear whooshing) (spear whooshing) (Lung Ti shouts) (men groaning) (weapons clanging) (spear whooshing) - Watch, don't let him escape! - Who said I wanted to? (men shouting) (weapons clanging) (spear whooshing) - My father. (Lung Ti groans) (weapons clanging) (men shouting) (spear whooshing) (shouts) (Gold Leopard groans) (spear whooshes) (man grunts) (weapons clanging) (men grunting) (spear whooshing) (weapons clanging) (spear whooshing) (dramatic synth music) (horse galloping) (suspenseful drum music) (spear whooshing) (suspenseful music) (laughing evilly) - Lung Ti, you are badly hurt.
