I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book to raise the Ghost of an idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it. Their faithful friend and Servant, Charles Dickens. May I inquire, Mr. Cratchit, what you are doing with that shovel full of coal? Why, I beg your pardon, sir, but the outer office is intensely cold. And my fire-- Your fire! - I should have said your fire, sir. - Yes, sir! It shows symptoms of going out, and I thought it might venture to replenish it with a small quantity of coal. Yes, well of course it's very evident to me you know, Mr. Cratchit, that you and I'll have to part. Oh. Oh, I see no help for it, sir. You don't pay for the coal, so you can afford to be reckless. Therefore very evident to me, sir, you know, that my interest is not your interest, nor my welfare your welfare. Get on with your work, sir. That'll keep you warm enough. I'm not cold, why should you be. And I am your senior, by a great many years, I fancy. And all about a small shovel full of coal. I'll have none of your mumbling, none of your mumbling. You have a wife and family to support, I understand. - Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir." How many children you got? A round half dozen, sir. Three boys and three girls. Tut tut tut! Can I afford a wife? - Yes, sir. - Eh? I mean, no, sir. Have I any children? I don't know sir. - Eh? - No, sir. How much am I constrained to pay you a week for your services? 15 schillings. Ha, be to your interests, sir, to see that you're worth it. A merry Christmas to you, Uncle, and God save you. Bah, humbug! Christmas a humbug? You can't mean that I'm sure. I do mean it sir. What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough. Come then, what right do you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough. Bah, humbug! Oh, don't be cross, Uncle. How can I help being cross, sir, when I live in such a world of fools as it is? "A merry Christmas." What's Christmas done for you, sir? It's a time for paying bills without money! Time for finding yourself a year older and not a penny richer. If I had my way sir, every fool who goes about saying "Merry Christmas," should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. - He should! - Uncle! Nephew, you keep Christmas your way, let me keep it in mine! Keep it? But you don't keep it. - Let me leave it alone then! Much good has it done you, much good will it ever do you. It's the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut heart freely. And therefore, though it's never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe it has done me good and will do me good. And I say God bless it! Here, Here. Here, here! Mr. Cratchit! If I hear another word from you, you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! Dear, dear, dear, dear. Quite a powerful speaker, sir. It's a wonder you don't go into parliament. Don't be angry, Uncle. Come, dine with us tomorrow. - I'll see you. - But why, why? Why did you get married? Because I fell in love. "Because I fell in," good evening. You never came to see us before that happened, why give that as a reason for not coming now? Good evening, sir! But I want nothing from you, I ask nothing of you. Well you won't get it so you won't be disappointed, will you. We've never had a quarrel to which I've been party, so why not let us part friends. Good evening, sir! Well, I'm sorry with all my heart you find this irrelevant, but I've made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So a Merry Christmas, Uncle! - Good evening, sir! - And a happy New Year! You're a noisy devil, that's what you are sir! Merry Christmas, Bob Cratchit. And the same to you sir, and many of them, and not forgetting your good lady, Mrs. Fred. Thank you, Cratchit. A merry Christmas to you.

Always ready and willing to quit your work, I notice. Well, it's seven o'clock, sir. That clock's fast. Well, I suppose you'll want all day off tomorrow, eh? Well, sir, if it's quite convenient? It isn't convenient. It isn't fair. If I was to stop half a crown for it, oh, you'd be mightily ill-used, I'll be bound wouldn't you. Don't think I'm ill-used do you? When I have to pay a whole day's wages for no work. It only happens once a year, sir. That's a pretty excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December. Well, I suppose you got to have it. Here, there's the key. You see, sir, that you're here all the earlier next morning. Good night sir, and a Merry Christmas. Bah, humbug! Not another bird like it. And it's worth it's weight in gold, and it weighs a bit I can tell you too. Merry Christmas, sir! Bah, humbug! Merry Christmas to you, my boy. Thank you sir, and same to you, sir. Oh! Thank you. How do you do? Good evening and a merry Christmas. Give us a penny. Get out of this. Clean? You call this clean? - Yes! Well it isn't. Hey, hey. Tell them to stop that noise.

Devil are you doing here? Frightening people out of their wits? Ah! Ah, humbug. Ah. Look well Ebenezer Scrooge, for only you can see me. What you want with me? Much. Who are you? In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley. In life? Why do you trouble me? It is required of everyone that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow men, and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. My spirit never walked beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hall. So I cannot rest. I cannot stay. I cannot linger anywhere. You are fettered. Why? I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link by link. Would you know the weight and length of the coil you bear yourself? Speak words of comfort to me, Jacob Marley. Speak words of comfort. Comfort? I have none to give. I am here to warn you, to save you if that be possible. To warn? To save me? From what? From such a fate as mine. To wander through the world and witness what I cannot share, but might have shared on Earth and turned to happiness. But, you were always a good man of business, Jacob. Business! Mankind should have been my business! Charity, forbearance, benevolence. All were my business, as they should be yours. Now heed me, for my time is short. You will be haunted by three spirits. Without their visit you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. You shall behold the visions of a Christmas past, a Christmas present, and a Christmas yet to come. Expect the first when the clock strikes midnight tonight. Marley! Look to see me no more! Marley! Marley! Bah. Hum... 12 o'clock, and all's well. 12 o'clock, and all's well. I am the Spirit of Christmas Past. I am here to show you the things that have been. Look back beyond the gulf of vanished years. The money is due and must be paid! But, sir, that's impossible. Then I shall have no alternative but to take immediate steps to recover it. But sir, you must see that if-- That is the way I conduct my business! You don't mean, sell us up? That is precisely what I do mean. But sir! I couldn't work in the hospital! Mr. Scrooge, I beg of you! Good day! You can't do this! You can't be so unjust. Give us a little more time, a week? Please! Oh, Belle, I didn't hear you come in. So it is true. - What do you mean? - What they say. That you are a man without pity, without remorse. Who weighs everything in the scale of profit and loss. - Belle? - I heard! I couldn't help hear. But this is business. If were to allow sentiment to enter this counting house, I should be in bankruptcy court within a year. And as for that couple who had just gone out, well, I'll set your mind first about them. Worthless, shiftless pair, who had my good money, now they want to avoid paying it back. Your money! Your good money. They asked your for a little breathing space, a little time in which to pay, that is all. Enough of this, Belle. I am ready to make allowances for your feelings as a woman. But I must ask you to leave my business affairs alone. When you marry me I shall insist. Have you taken leave of your senses? I've tried hard not to believe what they've said about you. I'd give anything not to believe it now. But the evidence of my own eye and ears, I must believe! You were not always so. But I can see now that one passion and one passion only engrosses you! - Gain! - How dare you. Even if it were so I've not changed toward you. You are changed. Changed in every way. You're not the man you were. Our contracts an old one, made when we were poor and content to be so. May you be happy, alone in the life you have chosen.

I passed his office window, as it was not shut up and there was a candle inside I could scarcely help see him. His partner is on the point of death, I hear. And there he sat, alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe. ♪ Chip chop, chip chop, the last man is dead ♪ Spirit, I cannot bear it, haunt me no more. I told you these were the shadows of the things that have been, but they are what they are. Do not blame me. Take me back! It's one o'clock, I know it is. Come in! And know me better, man. I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me. You have never seen the like of me before. Never. Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family, meaning, for I am very young. My elder brothers born in those later years. I don't think I have. I'm afraid I have not. Have you many brothers spirit? More than 1,800. A tremendous family to provide for. Spirit, conduct me where you will. Already I have been forth under compulsion and learned a lesson which is working now. If you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it. Touch my robe. And you shall see how your poor clerk, with his paltry 15 schillings a week, which you so grudgingly doled out to him, keeps Christmas. Touch my robe. Up yo get, Tiny Tim. Take! A boat? Oh. Get one. Thank you, father. Mother, mother, mother! We've been outside the baker's and we smelled a lovely goose cooking! Yes, and we're sure it's ours. Yes! ♪ A lovely goose, a lovely goose, a lovely goose ♪ Oh, what it is about your precious father then. And your brother Tiny Tim, and his sister Martha? One who's late last Christmas by half an hour. Mother! Oh, bless your heart, my dear! - Martha! - I missed you all! Peter. - Merry Christmas. We'd a deal of work to finish up last night, and had to clear away this morning. Well nevermind as long as you are, come. Come and sit before the fire my dear and get warm. No, no here's farther! Quick, Martha, hide! Quick hide! Quickly, quickly. Here we are. And how are you? And where's our Martha? She's not coming. Not coming? Not coming upon Christmas Day? Yes, father dear, here I am. Oh! Oh, you all! Oh, you! That will be the goose! I'll fetch it in! Oh, but you're cold. Come and sit down and warm a bit. And how did Tiny Tim behave? As good as gold, and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. Yes. He told me coming home that he hoped the people in the church saw him because he was a cripple, and that it might be pleasant for them to remember upon a Christmas day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men see. But he's growing stronger. Yes, growing strong and hearty. I wish I could believe you, Bob. But I'm afraid. Hurray! There never was such a goose! There will never be such a goose! Never! Bob, please say grace. For what we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. It's splendid, I can already vouch for it! Yay! And it's flavor will I know surpass my upmost expectations. Yay! With a mashed potato! - Oh! - And the apple sauce! Ah! It will I am sure, present a delightful combination that we shall remember till our dying day. Yay! Delicious, delicious. That's the best goose we ever had, mother. - Yes, indeed. - Oh, yes. Oh, I've eaten too much! (laughs) And even now, we haven't eaten at all. You laugh? Laugh? I envy them. Spirit, tell me that Tiny Tim will live. I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner, a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered in the future, the child will die. Oh, tell me that he'll be spared. If he is like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population? My own words. Come now. I give you a toast. I give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the feast. The founder of the feast indeed? I wish I had him here, I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it. But my dear, the children, Christmas Day. Should be Christmas Day, I'm sure, on which one drinks to the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man such as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert. Nobody knows him better than you do, poor fellow. My dear, Christmas Day. Well I'll drink his health for your sake and the days, not his. He'll be very merry and very happy, I've no doubt. Here's Mr. Scrooge's health. Now children, all together, Mr. Scrooge's health. Mr. Scrooges health! Mr. Scrooge's health. And now, Tiny Tim will sing to us. Yes, Tiny, do sing. What shall I sing? "Hark! The Herald Angels". Yes, "Hark! The Herald Angels". ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the new-born king ♪ ♪ Peace on earth, and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ Come now, and see how others keep Christmas. ♪ Join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ With the angelic host proclaim ♪ ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the new-born king ♪ ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the new-born king ♪ Ghost of the future, I fear you more than any specter I have seen. You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not been, but will be in the time to come. And as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company. I don't know much about it either way, I only know he's dead. - When did he die? - Last night I believe. Why, what was the matter with him? I thought he'd never die! Heaven knows! What's he done with his money? Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left for to me, that's all I know. - How are you? - Very well, how are you? So old Nick has got his own at last. - So I'm told. - Cold isn't it? Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I suppose? Oh no, no, I've got something else to think about. I do not see myself in my accustom place. Where am I? Why am I not there? Don't stand there staring as if you were afraid, woman. Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like this? Not a dead man, I suppose. Open this bundle old Joe and let me know the value of it. I aint afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it. There's your account. I wouldn't give another sixpence. Now mine, Joe. Pah! Eight schillings. I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine. And now undo my bundle, Joe. Bed curtains. Ah. Bed curtains. You don't mean to say you took them down, rings and all, with him lying there? Why not? You was born to make your fortune, and you will certainly do it. Here, don't drop the oil on the blankets! His blankets? Who else's? He isn't likely to take cold without them, I dare say. Hope he didn't die of anything catching. Oh, don't you be afraid of that. Ah, you can look through that shirt until your eyes ache and you won't find a hole in it. It's the best he had. It'd been wasted if it hadn't been for me. What do you call wasting of it? Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure. I took it off him. Calico's just as becoming to the body. He couldn't have looked uglier than he did in that one! This is the end of it you see. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now. Merciful heavens! What is that? Is this the man they spoke of? Neglected. Robbed. Hated. Can you not show me some tenderness connected with death? My little child. Tiny Tim. Thy childish essence was from God. I met Mr. Scrooge's nephew today, and he said to me, "I'm heartily sorry for you Mr. Cratchit, "and heartily sorry for your good wife." Though, how he knew that I don't know. Knew what my dear? Why, that you were a good wife. Everybody knows that. Well observe, my boy. And he said, "If there is any service that I can do for you, "pray come to me." It almost seemed as though he had known our Tiny Tim and felt with us. And I'm sure we shall none of us forget him, nor this first parting there has been among us. Never, father. And I know that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was, although he was but a little child, we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it. No, father. I'm very happy. Very happy. Now spirit tell me, what man that was whom we saw lying dead? 'Fore I draw nearer to the stone at which you point. Tell me, are these the shadows of the things that will be? Or are they the shadows of the things that may be, only? Ebenezer Scrooge! Am I that man who lay upon the bed? No spirit, no! I'll not be the man I was! I'll not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse! Why show me this if it is all too late? Tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone! I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year! I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach! No, no! Oh. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. Oh, Jacob Marley, heaven and Christmas time be praised for this. Thank you. On me knees I thank you, Jacob. On me knees. They're not torn down! They're not torn down! Ah, the shadows of things that would have been may be dispelled, they will! They will! Ah, they will! They will! A Merry Christmas! God bless you. Oh, I don't know what to do. I'm as happy as a schoolboy, I'm as merry as an angel. I'm as giddy as a drunken man! Oh, merry Christmas to everyone! Happy New Year to all the world! Woo hoo! Oh, here, here! Here's the saucepan that the gruel was in. Yes, and there's the door that old Marley's ghost came through! Yes, it's all right, it's all true. It all happened. Oh, hooray, hooray! Ah, glorious, glorious! Hey, boy! Hey, a merry Christmas! It is Christmas Day isn't it? Why, of course! Ah, I knew I hadn't missed it! Oh, the spirits have done it all in one night! Hey, do you know the poulterer's at the corner of the street next but one? I should hope I did. An intelligent boy, a remarkable boy! Do you know if they've sold the prize turkey that they had hanging there? It'll be hanging there now. Well you go and buy it. Walk-er! No, no, no, I'm in earnest. You go and buy it and bring it back here, and I'll tell you where to take it. And you come back with the man and I'll give you a schilling. You come back in less than five minutes and I'll give you half a crown! Hooray! Hey! Hey, mister! Hey! Mister! Hey! Bless me, you can't carry that to the Cratchit's. You'll have to have a cab. Here you are my boy, there's the address, and there's the money. And there's the money for you. Very kind of you to have brought it round. Ah, merry Christmas my dear. Thank you, sir, the same to you. Who won't come and dine with you? Uncle Scrooge! Still, was no consequence, he won't lose much for dinner. Indeed. Well I think he'll lose a very good dinner. Is your master in, my dear? Yes sir. Can I see him my love? He's in the dining room sir, I'll show you in. He knows me. You sit there. Thank you. You sit here beside me. Fred. Bless my soul, who's this? It is I, your Uncle Scrooge. I've come to dinner. Will you let me in, Fred? Why, it's Uncle Scrooge, it can't be. Well then, a merry Christmas to you Uncle! Come in.
