ONE SUMMER OF HAPPINESS The bitter wind of Iife- -swept in over a chiId in the prime of her Iife. She sacrificed her Iife on the aItar of aberration. The coming of the new age has without mercy- -swept in over our quiet corner of the worId. But what was the point of this sacrifice? OnIy God knows. He may have meant for it to be a warning. He may have wanted to say: Heavy is the price for ruthIessness... ...aberration and seIfishness. Heavy is the price for the seducer. TruIy I say unto you: Whosoever shaII offend one of these IittIe ones that beIieve in me- -it is better for him that a miIIstone were hanged about his neck- -and he were cast into the sea. God's punishment is hard on man. But it is better that one person shouId succumb- -as a horrific warning- -than that the entire peopIe shouId perish. Amen. It's so coId. And summer was just here. It wiII never return. Summer can't Iast, even if you wouId give your Iife for it. Do you remember when everything was in bIoom, Kerstin? An eternity ago... ...where the beautifuI girIs aII reside. Hurrah! Hi! Congrats! -So you made it. -Get up here. We're proud of you, G?ran. It was an embarrassment that you onIy got a B in math- -but we'II have to forgive you. You've earned some rest now. Marianne was there - sweet as candy. She said I'd come back with a tan and smeIIing of hay- -and that she'd be waiting, faithfuI untiI death. Four cheers for G?ran! Marianne won't wait that Iong. Sing of the graduate's gIorious day Let us rejoice in the time of our youth WhiIe aII our hearts stiII are beating strong And the bright, shining future is ours There's no time for gIoom in our hearts and minds A few days Iater, when things had settIed- -I went to uncIe Anders's farm to reIax. Out in the sticks with the simpIe peopIe, Iike my dad aIways said. -Do we have to Iisten to that noise? -That coffee-grinder sounds worse. It's easier to take with the smeII of coffee. You're up earIy today. It's onIy 8 o'cIock. When in Rome... Up with the Iark. -Be carefuI or he'II hear you. -AII I do here is sIeep. -ShouIdn't you get dressed? -Are you having a reception? We're pIanting potatoes today. Care to come aIong? No, but I'II pIant some fIowers if you want me to. Good morning. StendaI. Step up and say heIIo. - G?ran StendaI, my brother's son. They got their Iast name from the farm. They onIy Iiked the name and moved into town. -And took the name with them. -They couIdn't take the farm. -I'm Kerstin. -Let's eat. -Is that the heIp you're getting? -Yeah. Do you have a coveraII I can use, Sigrid? I'II tag aIong. You changed your mind aII of a sudden. You won't pIant fIowers among the potatoes, right? There you go. Don't give Kerstin any ideas. She's from a decent home. Mine isn't aII that bad, either. And you said you wanted heIp. Right... -It's not aII that warm. -Just wait untiI this afternoon. Get these bags up there. Knock it off! You're not big enough. Get a better grip. There. -Don't Iook so spitefuI. -Do I? How oId are you? Fifteen? Fourteen and a haIf. And you, sir? Don't be so formaI. We're aII famiIiar around here. Except with the minister. We caII him ''Reverend''. -I'II soon be twenty. -I'II have to caII you ''uncIe''. -Is your back hurting yet? -Don't you have machines for this? Not when you onIy have 40 acres. Don't get dirt on your fingers. We don't have much of that here. You're doing weII. What do peopIe do for fun around here? -Fun? -Dancing and such. I'II go stir crazy if I can't be around peopIe. PeopIe go dancing by the Iake during summer. What about the rest of the year? Do you hibernate? You get so tired that you just go to bed. There's a meeting at the schooI tomorrow. I'II have to go and check it out. -Do you find this boring? -Yeah, don't you? Are you happy here? Of course I'm happy. -Are you heIping me out? -Not at aII. -You think I can't keep up? -Of course you can. -It's a IoveIy piece. -My hands are pretty useIess. PIanting potatoes makes you stiff. Let Kerstin sing something. -She's a reaI song-bird. -I can't. You can't? - She sings soIo in church. Come on. Which song? -I don't know any songs Iike that. -You couId do... What's it caIIed? ''Just a day, and just a singIe moment''... Do that one. UncIe? How oId is Kerstin? Kerstin? WeII... - You're seventeen. -What did she teII you? -Fourteen. -She's been puIIing your Ieg aII day. -I have to get back home. Maybe so. Goodbye and thank you. Goodbye. -WiII you go to the schooI tomorrow? -I don't know. -I don't think they'II Iet me. -What? They won't Iet you? Young peopIe are funny, Sigrid. When he was singing... ...she wouIdn't take her eyes off him and watched him with her whoIe face. -She'II show up tomorrow. -That's aII we need. What? Right... Hey there. You're going to the schooI, right? I'II give you a ride. So she didn't show up? Who? I just had a Iook around. Who's that strange feIIow down there? That's Torsten. He's been a bit sIow since birth. -The Fredriks took him in. -Are you spying on me? No, I was going to the schooI to see what the youngsters are up to. -What's the meeting about? -The youngsters have this cIub. -Do they do anything in particuIar? -It's an amateur theater cIub... ...and they have a study circIe. They just want to pIay together. -The farms are far apart. -WiII there be dancing tonight? At the schooI? Are you insane? The minister's aIready upset. He feeIs that the onIy union- -that God has bIessed is marriage. -And peopIe buy that? -The reIigious peopIe support him. What about you? Where do you stand? Try to figure that one out. Are you coming to the schooI? -It's a backwater pIace. -I don't reaIIy know. Don't Iet the Fredriks hear you. They toe the Iine for the minister. -Why don't we go inside? -Why are we out here? -The schooI's Iocked. -Go get the key. -KIas went to get it. -Did you get the key? The meeting's off. The minister won't give up the key. -But we got permission. -Let's break the door in. CaIm down! There's no use getting aII worked up. -We'II have the meeting on Wednesday. -HeII no, Iet's show the minister. We'II show him! I think we shouId go home. Don't Iet him pass. This road is cIosed. -PIease step aside. -No, no... Stay there. Damn minister... I toId you to step aside. RascaI! CaIm down! -What are you doing? -The minister cIosed down the schooI. I don't see how he can keep peopIe out of a pubIic buiIding... -...but this won't soIve anything. -There won't be any more meetings. We can't just stand around here. You can have my oId barn. Fix it up and have your meetings there. -Thank you. -Come. I have a suggestion for you. UncIe Anders suggested that the cIub wouId take over his oId barn- -and turn it into a meeting pIace. It was a briIIiant idea. The youngsters needed a pIace- -and here they had a roof and four waIIs that nobody reaIIy used. I caught myself keeping an eye out for Kerstin. But she never came. -You can get started. -Thanks. It'II take a Iot of hard work... ...but we can make it work. We'II get started tomorrow- -and you're more than weIcome to Iend an extra hand. No Kerstin tonight, but SyIvia asked me to dance. She was one of the soft-Iipped IocaI girIs. Giddy-up, IoveIy girI. Excuse me. -So you came. -Yes, I heard the music. -What's aII this? -Great things. -Come dance. -No... But Kerstin... Sigrid... Are you Iistening to the music from the barn? -Is that our oId barn? -It's their barn now. I wanted to do my part. What do you think? You'II get in troubIe with the minister. They'II say that your father has betrayed the church. But the minister has to come to his senses. -Go up there and dance. -I've never had time for that. -And now I'm too oId. -Too oId? No, Sigrid. Sigrid! -I was waiting for you to come. -You were? -Don't teII me you're Ieaving. -I have to go home. It's Saturday evening. No one wiII wonder when you get home. How wouId you know? -Can I waIk you home? -No, I know the way. Good night. KIasse? ShouIdn't we invite the dandy? -He's too good for that. -You're being siIIy. Do you have enough peopIe? Sign me up. StendaI. -With an H? -No. Isn't it nice here? I don't feeI Iike sIeeping tonight. ShouIdn't we rest for a whiIe? No, you're thinIy dressed and it's chiIIy. Did you see the girIs staring? They're jeaIous of me. -And why's that? -Because you danced with me. Graduates are charming. It's a shame I've onIy met a few. And the ones I've met have been stuck-up. -Are you stuck-up? -Count on it. Come get your coffee! -You'II get proper windows. -And eIectric Iighting. Heat and hot water, right? Just get the roof fixed first. We'II take care of the roof and get some benches. And boards, for the stage. You couId get a part in a pIay we're putting on. -What pIay? -''The V?rmIanders''. It's not exactIy new, but it shouId draw peopIe at the opening this faII. -You couId be Erik. -I won't be here this faII. But thanks anyway. Who do you have in mind as Anna? It's a new girI. She's over there. It's a gambIe, but I think she'II be fine. -Kerstin? -Kerstin? Are you going to be in a pIay? -Me? -That's right. -But I can't. -Sure you can, if you get permission. It's a reaIIy big part. - Convince her, G?ran. I know she can do it. Can you get away tomorrow afternoon? -I'II try. -Great. -Are you daydreaming? -I'm not daydreaming. I'm thinking. So you can think? Yes, can you? On days Iike this, you just want to think about poetry. Make up poems... It couId be because it's so beautifuI here, or because you're here. -What do you think? -How shouId I know? Are there crayfish in the stream? ShouId we try to catch a few? -You can't untiI the faII. -But I won't be here then. No, you won't. Why not daydream on a day Iike this? ReaIity can never be as good as dreams. Kerstin? Where are you? What got into you? Come here... Grandpa! -HeIIo, Grandma. -What are you doing here, Kerstin? -And who is this handsome boy? -This is G?ran. HeIIo. -Did Grandpa see you come? -He's down by the Iake as usuaI. He's waiting for the prize pike, and he's been waiting for so Iong- -that the pike shouId be as oId as that oId fart. Look who's taIking. LittIe oId Iady... -It's enough to feed the cat. -The cat has to eat, too. It's hard to get anything but roach and ruffe- -when the pike snatches aII the fish. -You shouId try bait casting. -Pikes won't faII for such noveIties. Not in HeIImo Parish. But... If you want to know what a reaI HeIImo pike Iooks Iike- -just have a Iook at Kerstin's aunt. But be carefuI because she bites. -Johan... -Don't start. Grandma and Grandpa... Don't teII anyone that you saw us together. Can't aunt Anna stand that you've grown up and want a man? -And why shouIdn't she get one? -I'm oId enough to speak my mind. Be nice to her. She deserves it. Who's that boy? Do you know what I'm thinking about? If I shouId feeI reaIIy bIue sometime- -I'd visit the oId foIks. They'd know how to heIp me. -What was that? -Pay attention! I'II twist your nose if you don't teII me. WeII? Come to me when things are bad. -Don't you want to pIay? -No, we're having coffee. It's after-church coffee at the Fredriks. I think we'II get something more substantiaI than coffee. Why did they invite us when we didn't go to church? -Don't you ever go there? -I can get scoIded eIsewhere. The minister wiII be there and they're up to no good. About the barn? He won't be happy about that. PeopIe can be so dense and petty. It's not Iike the Fredriks wanted any part of it. -Sigrid won't Iike it, either. -She can't face the minister now. Sigrid? We'II waIk with you. -HeIIo. -HeIIo, Reverend. -No... -I insist, Miss Persson. In the name of the Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit. Amen. Amen. I'II start here. -Here you go, Mr. Persson. -Thank you, Reverend. Sugar? -Watch it, girI. -Oops. Give me a spIash, too. I don't mind some on the saucer. Just make sure it's a Iot. -Have a bun, Reverend. -Thank you. It Iooks good, but I'II stick to the biscuits. It Iooks to be a good year for farming- -with the right amounts of rain and warmth. You couId heIp me weed out turnips tomorrow. It's hard work, but a good Iesson for the future. Some peopIe weed things out and some shouId be weeded out. What about the turnips, Reverend? The ones you Ieave in the ground? It's for their sake that you weed things out. Yes, but it takes care and knowIedge. I had a fieId-hand who weeded out the turnips and Ieft aII the weeds. You have to get to know the pIants. -How much do you want? -Trade services with my uncIe. I've heard that Mr. Persson has been unusuaIIy generous IateIy. You gave away some property and peopIe work there on Sundays. -For free? Can that pay off? -Most youngsters around here... ...are busy during the weeks and have to work on Sundays. Sundays are for the church. One shouIdn't negIect the spirituaI. Church attendance is poor among the youngsters. We onIy had about haIf of the choir in church today. Soon they'II want hymns on phonograph records. Record the sermons instead. It's nice to see the youngsters sing. How many youngsters did we have today? -Two, not counting your chiIdren. -Three. -They take time to pIay baII. -Perhaps it's more enjoyabIe. Some of the oIder parishioners are setting a poor exampIe... ...by betraying the church. The thing is that you have to deaI with the corporeaI, too. -Like in Persson's barn. -A roof is nice when it's raining. -WouIdn't you agree? -And you got the barn roof fixed. -They'II fix up their pIace. -They'II put on theater pIays... -...dance and show movies. -Is there something wrong with that? The youngsters are misguided. They abandon the church... ...and refuse to Iisten to their eIders. They don't care about the sanctity of marriage. I suppose it's in Iine with aII the modern bustIe. Not even the countryside has been spared. There are faIse prophets everywhere. Listen to them. PeopIe engage in sports and desecrate the Sabbath. They have cIub nights with dancing and obscene music. It is ungodIy and depraved! What about Christian toIerance of the youth? The youth issues have been taIked to death now. -It's about time something happens. -Today's youth has been corrupted. SensibIe peopIe have to fight the rabbIe. RabbIe? I find that a bit inconsiderate. -''RabbIe'' is a harsh word. -I judge peopIe by what I see. The youngsters' pIace is subject to God's punishment. Punishment... Punishment... Can you get out Iater? I just have to pIay the organ a IittIe bit. We'II meet up by the barn. We're rehearsing the pIay tonight and we can't do it without you. Promise me you'II come. -I don't know. -Kerstin... What's the matter? -I stepped out for a drink. -Offer Master StendaI a gIass. The scoop is fine. PIay something soIemn now, G?ran. I got to know the countryside. It was Iike crawIing through a quagmire. It huft your back and knees and you'd wonder why you were there. But you stayed there. Something kept puIIing you forward. The Iand seemed to beckon and ask to be touched. You had the summer sun - and then there was Kerstin. G?ran! What's wrong, G?ran? It's nothing. I just got dizzy. I'm fine now. Kerstin? -Don't force yourseIf on girIs! -I'II show you! WiII there be anything eIse? -No. -Good. I see you got it started again. -What was the probIem? -Someone put something in the tank. -The nozzIe was cIogged. -Someone was out to get you. It's a good thing it was downhiII coming home. I guess Kerstin heIped? Turn that thing off! Do you want supper? No, it's Midsummer Eve and you have no heart. -Bye. -Get going. Give the girIs my best. What are you waiting for, Sigrid? What do I have to wait for? You shouIdn't stay home on a night Iike this. You get the urge to waIk around and take in aII the smeIIs. There's mischief in the air on a night Iike this. You shouId be out having fun with the other youngsters. -You're stiII young. -Am I? It takes my own father to say that. WeII... -WiII you have coffee waiting? -I usuaIIy do. You're cIosing the wrong eye, Kerstin. Just Iike that dog. -I want that. -Try it again. -I won't hit anything Iike this. -Then cIose both your eyes. WeII done, Kerstin! Do I get the dog? -It's so cute! Look, G?ran! -Come on. ShaII we dance? I don't want to, G?ran. -Why are you afraid to dance? -Afraid? I can teII that you want to. Don't you know how to dance? Sure, I dance sometimes during recess in schooI. Come on. CouId I give you a few fIowers A few roses just for you There can be no room for sadness, my precious The roses were aII pIucked from the garden of a king And you need swords just to get within reach One of them is white and other one is red But the third one is the one I wouId give you It's not in bIoom just now It won't untiI I'm dead But it stays in bIoom a whiIe, my precious -What fIower is it? -Memories. Everything you have Ieft when you Iose the one you Iove. That memory couId make for a beautifuI fairy-taIe. Perhaps. What if I couId take you to the end of the worId tonight? I'd Iet you. WouId you? Yes. -I have to get home. -Kerstin... Midsummer onIy comes around once every year. -Did you have fun tonight? -Yes. But don't teII anyone that I danced. Don't even teII Sigrid. -WouId that get you a maiden's bower? -Yes. You have to pick seven different fIowers to put under your piIIow. No, it's too Iate for that. -The night is aImost over. -Kerstin... FooI! Why did you have to ruin everything when it was so beautifuI? Kerstin! Kerstin! Wait, Kerstin! Can I see you tomorrow? I didn't see Kerstin at aII that weekend- -and she continued to stay out of sight. The days passed. When JuIy came around we were bringing in hay. That's fine. That's good. The minister's a speedster now. God damn...! -Are you okay? -I've sprained my foot. PuII on it. -Is it that bad? -Don't bIame me for screaming. PuII! Wait! The Ieg's getting Ionger. I must have broken it. Give me a hand and I'II try to get home. We'II pass by the rectory. I'II show that minister. ReaIIy? I see. Thank you. -He'II stay at the hospitaI. -For how Iong? How wouId I know? The Ieg's broken. That's the punishment. Don't be so pessimistic. It was just an accident. Why are you crying? It's nothing. But who'II work the farm whiIe he's gone? That's it. I'II heIp you. You? Good day. Good day, nurse. -Nothing but rain. -It never stops when it's this bad. -Your fieIds wiII wash away. -Shut your trap! -Take it easy. -Move him over here, H?kansson. Don't Iaugh. I wonder why you haven't disIocated your mouth. A strong farmer shouIdn't be stuck here in pIaster in JuIy... -...when the hay is ready. -Farmers are never happy. You compIain if it's too dry and if you get a few drops of rain. How has that hurt you? Even God has troubIe keeping you farmers happy. Why are you Iaughing? I'd Iike to introduce you to the minister back home. -Knock it off! -Hit him with the bIanket. Do you have a barometer? I'm curious about tomorrow's weather. -It'II rain tomorrow, too. -I couId break your other arm. Go check the barometer, nurse. - I'II put you on your motorcycIe... ...and then we'II see how you'II end up. - No... G?ran! -Good day, UncIe. How are you? -Not bad. -This is my nephew G?ran. -StendaI. -I brought you some newspapers. -How about this weather? Don't worry about the hay. It's aII been brought in. -Sigrid took care of it. -By herseIf? No, your tenants heIped. They stopped working on the barn. -You've made quite an investment. -Viberg and the rest? OIIe and few others. And to some extent... Look. Three bIisters on my Ieft hand and two on my right. It burns Iike heII. -Put some butter on that. -No, suIfa. -PeniciIIin, that's the ticket. -Use suIfa. Have you seen Kerstin IateIy? No, I haven't. I haven't had the time. -What's this? -I'm stuck here in pIaster. -But your mouth works fine. -You don't have to get up earIy. We'II get started on the faIIow fieIds now. -What is it? -I'm just so fond of you. -You can take it easy. -Here? I don't think so. I have to deaI with this tub of Iard- -and my Ieg is stuck up there. It itches reaIIy bad underneath. - I guess that's your fauIt, too. UncIe? Do you think that I couId run a farm? -No, I don't think so. -Why not? Grandpa was a farmer and you're a farmer. You're a city person and it takes a Iot to run a farm. -How Iong does it take to Iearn it? -20-30 years. And some never Iearn. You can start by spreading manure. So some peopIe never Iearn? -Right... -Just shut... G?ran! Hi there! Are you driving around, G?ran? Are you hauIing manure? -Hi, Marianne! -You Iook amazing. Did you win a pIowing contest? And you're so tanned. -That's just manure. -Hi! -What are you doing here? -We're taking you to the mountains. -Are we interrupting you? -No, I'm on my way home. Drive up there. I'II foIIow you with the wagon. You can't be serious about staying. Go get your things. -No, I can't. -WouId you rather stay here? -Is there anything keeping you here? -I have to heIp my uncIe out. He won't be back for some time. And I can't Ieave my friends. We're rehearsing a pIay. And there's something eIse... Are you in a pIay with yokeIs? How wiII that matter in 1 00 years? Not at aII, but it matters a Iot right now. -And I'm happy here. -G?ran's faIIen in Iove. -He's faIIen head over heeIs. -Don't be siIIy. -What's her name? -Kerstin. What a precious homespun name. But you'II come if I ask you. Won't you, darIing? -Oh, is that her? -Pretty IittIe thing. I'II bet she smeIIs Iike a cow. It's getting Iate. I have to Iet the horses out to graze. Stop working now. We have to rehearse. -Do you know your part, OIIe? -Yeah, yeah. Just don't taIk so formaI but as a normaI person. Let's see... - Come here, SyIvia. - Hi, G?ran. Where's Kerstin? -Why isn't she here? -Go get her. We'II start with the second scene. Does it sound bad? Didn't you teII my father that I was good enough... No, SyIvia! You have to show some emotion. You have a heart, right? Then use it. Hush, girI. You can't Iet Sven and Lisa hear that kind of taIk. But you toId me when the taiIor proposed to me... No! The audience has to hear you. Do it again. But you toId me when the taiIor proposed to me- -that I shouId get a true gentIeman or a weaIthy farmer! Shut up, Nisse! I'm sorry to bother you. CouId I see Miss Kerstin? That wouId be fine. She's out by the barn. Thank you. -I want to taIk to you, Kerstin. -Ouch! I don't want to hurt you, but you'II just run away. -I don't want to see you again. -We have to taIk. ReaIIy? Then Iet me go. -I won't run for you. -TeII me why you're hiding. -That's my business. -We didn't think you'd desert us. And for no reason. What's with you, Kerstin? Listen... Do you think that I Iike yeIIing at you? -It seems Iike it. -Kerstin... Have you forgotten how cIose friends we were? -A Iong time ago. -What about the others? I didn't want to Iet them down, but I didn't have a choice. -It's aII your fauIt. -My fauIt? Which of the two girIs are you in Iove with? -In Iove? -One of them caIIed you ''darIing''. Oh, you fooI. That doesn't mean anything. We were aII friends at schooI. Hey... G?ran? When I saw you with those three- -it feIt Iike it ruined everything. They're the same as you, and you were so different. You seemed more reaI. If you had caIIed for me, I couIdn't have said a word. -That's no reason to hide. -Yes. I didn't want to see you again. I knew that I wouId just meIt if I did. -Like wax. -Kerstin... -Can I have that fIower? -No. -Then I'II take it. -What's so speciaI about it? -Can't you pick your own? -Sure, but that wouIdn't be the same. Poor thing. It's aIready wiIted. Poor IittIe fIower. It'II never bIoom again. Why did I have to pick you? There'II be new fIowers next summer. Poor fIower. It onIy got to Iive for one summer. Summer is so short. It's getting cIoser. There'II be thunder tonight. I'm so sIeepy. They'II be mad when I get home Iate. They can't know that I'm in a pIay. They'd never aIIow it. Maybe you shouId go home and get some sIeep. It doesn't matter. I get to sIeep during winter. Bye. It's raining too much. Come on in. -But... -Come on! We have to be quiet. I don't mind the thunder when you're here. What wouId they say if they saw me here? What if they found out? They'd put me in a enormous prison, where you couIdn't get to me. I'd cIimb over the waII. Over any waII... G?ran... SIut! She was nowhere to be seen after that night. I waited for her and didn't know what to do. Everything feIt Iike an empty wasteIand. I stafted to understand the pressure she had to Iive with. LoneIiness. You couId feeI the tension over by the Fredriks by day. I stayed away to avoid making things worse for her. Weeks passed and my chest was aching with Ionging. No one said anything, untiI one day... You must think that you've done something shamefuI. -What do you know? -They say that you've ruined Kerstin. -Are the crones saying that? -Don't badmouth decent peopIe. You'II Ieave, but she'II be stuck with her reputation. It's hard to cIear your name. You sound just Iike the minister. You're so damn sanctimonious. -You have no shame. -Shame? Is that just something for reIigious spinsters? Try being human instead. If you'd gotten a man, you wouIdn't think Iike this. Sigrid? I'm sorry, Sigrid. I didn't mean anything by that. Forget about it. I've had to fiII my mother's shoes with three younger sibIings. I wanted to get away, but there was so much to do. I aIways thought that I'd be free next year. But Iook at me now. You've trapped yourseIf. You can break free if you want to. No, Iife treats you however it wants to. Yes, because you can't work up the nerve. Do you think that Kerstin is hiding from you? They've sent her from the farm. Try to change that. Where did they send her? Sigrid! Kerstin! You came! I've Ionged for you. I care for you. I care for aII of you. I want to hide with you somewhere. Kerstin... We'II aIways be together. There wiII never be anyone eIse. When I have you aII to myseIf, everything is just fine. -Nothing couId make me Ieave. -But you'II have to. I don't have to. No one can make me. I Iike it when you Iook at me Iike that. No one eIse can do that. Look at the water, G?ran. It's fuII of siIver. Do you want to go swimming? Don't you want to? I don't feeI shy with you. It's as if you are a part of me. Like we've aIways beIonged together. I'II race you in. G?ran... Don't forget me. Never. I'II never forget you, darIing Kerstin. But you'II be Ieaving soon. I'm staying here. I'II stay with you forever. -WouId that make you happy? -Yes, more than I can teII you. Do you know what we're getting into? I care so much for you. G?ran... You didn't have to come. I've made up my mind. WouIdn't it be better if you Ieft, G?ran? Why ruin your future? We've worked to give you a good Iife. -Don't be ungratefuI. -You won't Iet me find my own path. You've chosen a siIIy path. There are enough farmers. Then we wouIdn't have 24 dereIict farms here. The countryside needs peopIe! The Iand is stiII being farmed. Fine fieIds are Ieft uncuItivated. Your father wouId turn in his grave. -Don't make my son a fieId-hand. -G?ran is free to come and go. -I have things Ieft to do. -PIayacting with youngsters. And you're prepared to throw away your future. You don't seem to appreciate the area where you grew up. Fate aIIowed me to escape and I don't want my son here. There's pIenty to discuss. - But you'd better Ieave, G?ran. Think about it during winter. You might not want to stake your Iife on 40 acres. It'II give you time to think. You're aIways weIcome here. Now you won't have to rise earIy. -WiII G?ran be staying? -No. Mountains or manure... It's nice to have things back to normaI. You feeI Iike a new person when you wash off aII the dust. What wiII you do after roII-caII tomorrow? I don't know. I've pIanned on going out to the country. Haven't you had enough of what's her name? -That homespun thing. -A summer infatuation? -I suspected as much. -It'II Iast past summer. So it's true Iove? An eternity that Iasts a few weeks. I thought better of you. She must be some farmgirI with rotten teeth. I've aIways admired you. Don't ruin it by being tacky. -Did girIs Iook Iike that before? -How oId is she? -Seventeen. -Just a chiId. WiII you throw your Iife away for that? -Wait untiI you meet Kerstin. -I don't want to see her. Cheers. -Lennart Mattsson? -Here. You're so far away, G?ran. AIong with everything we have... Nothing has been the same since you Ieft. I'm back on the farm, but I'm so IoneIy. Everything has gone against me. I wish that I was with you, or that you were here. When I'm writing you, and not just thinking of you- -you feeI a bit cIoser. KIas has asked about you. What about the pIay? Our pIay... G?ran StendaI? G?ran... I'm so sad. Your Kerstin. I kissed the Ietter where I put the X. It's for you. -G?sta MuIIer? -Here. -Ivar Berg? -Here. -Torsten Gren? -Here. -BertiI DahIgren? -Here. -Oskar Viktorsson? -Here. -Is G?ran StendaI not present? -No. I've Iearned to hate God and want to tear down heaven and earth. I just want to foIIow my own path in Iife. They said that I had sinned and that I was Iost. When I'm awake at night, it's Iike they're aII there to scoId me. How can Iove be something fouI and fiIthy? Humans are created good, so how can it be fouI? HeIp me, G?ran. I want to Iive whiIe I'm young enough to Iive. I'II heIp you be happy. KIasse... Fire and damnation are upon you! The farm is subject to God's punishment! It's a shame, Sigrid. They were finished. -It's God's punishment. -Don't give me that crap. ''THE V?RMLANDERS'' I don't know why I speak so formaI. You sound Iike a book. Be happy with that. But you toId me when the taiIor proposed to me- -that I shouId get a true gentIeman or a weaIthy farmer! Shut your trap! They're up on stage. He said heIIo and asked if I was NiIs Jonsson from FryksdaIen. Then he asked me to come aIong and cIear a path for him. I got myseIf a Iever and we headed up the mountain- -where I started breaking and cracking... ...so that the sparks... -Stone spIinters and sparks. -They were fIying by my ears. -Feet. -Then he showed up... ''And then Dundrapart shook my hand...'' He said that he'd been in a Iot of countries- -but that he'd never come across anyone from FryksdaIen. ''Then he went to the cabinet...'' He went to the cabinet and got bread, herring and butter... -Cheese! -Cheese... He made me a Iarge nip and some sandwiches... No! ''Gave me a Iarge nip.'' He gave me a nip and I had a merry time for days. -And I was weII paid. -Can you shut up? I'm too nervous for this! I'm going home now. -Are you happy? -I've never been this happy. Erik! Anna! Erik! Anna! Take a bow. CouId this get any better? You couIdn't ask for a happier ending. Bravo! How are we back there? We're fine back here. We're imagining going to the end of the worId. -What was that? -Going to the end of the worId. -WouId you come home with me? -Yes, but they won't Iike me. Sure they wiII. They'II be nuts about you. -What are you doing? -I'm kissing your back. I can feeI you scratching. Just wait and I'II give you a proper kiss. I can't wait. Kerstin? Kerstin?! Kerstin? Kerstin? Can you hear me? Kerstin! I must have hurt myseIf. It feeIs Iike my back is broken. -You're in a bad pIace. I'II heIp. -No...! How are you, Kerstin?! It's not that bad. If I can just be stiII. Don't be afraid, Kerstin. I'II go get heIp. G?ran?! Don't Ieave me. Stay here. I have to, Kerstin. I'II run as fast as I can. No...! Stop! HeIp us! -Isn't that Bernt's IittIe girI? -I can't Ieave her. Get an ambuIance! Come and Iay down next to me. Why is it so coId? It's not winter yet. It was summer today. Are you aIive? Why is it so dark? Kerstin? Kerstin...! The bitter wind of Iife- -swept in over a chiId in the prime of her Iife. She sacrificed her Iife on the aItar of aberration. The coming of the new age has without mercy- -swept in over our quiet corner of the worId. But what was the point of this sacrifice? OnIy God knows. He may have meant for it to be a warning. He may have wanted to say: Heavy is the price for ruthIessness... ...aberration and seIfishness. Heavy is the price for the seducer. TruIy I say unto you: Whosoever shaII offend one of these IittIe ones that beIieve in me- -it is better for him that a miIIstone were hanged about his neck- -and he were cast into the sea. God's punishment is hard on man. But it is better that one person shouId succumb- -as a horrific warning- -than that the entire peopIe shouId perish. Amen. From dust you came... ...to dust you shaII return. Jesus Christ, our savior... ...shaII raise you up on the Iast day. BeIoved Kerstin... We, your friends who have gathered here... ...wiII remember you as the ray of Iight you were for aII of us. No one can know why you had to sacrifice your Iife... ...but we know that no person has the right to judge. Those who judge wiII one day be judged by the same Iaw. The onIy true thing in Iife... ...is that humans Iove each other. For the greatest thing of aII is Iove. If you shouId be punished for being yourseIf- -and for having the courage to Iive... ...then Iife wouIdn't be worth Iiving. You've Ieft a gap behind you. We wiII miss you... ...and remember you. G?ran... Don't forget me. My name is Kerstin.
