Sweet dreams. Sleep well Commander? Like a baby Zinovitz, cradled in his mother's arms. I could use a glass of orange juice. Cup of Cafe au lait will suit me just fine. An Arabian blend is more like it. How 'bout it Becker, is there any of that on board? I'll check the inventory, I'm sure we can come up with something. How about issuing an order for juice and coffee, Captain? Um, throw on some bagels. Yeah, croissant with with cheese, onion, maybe. We have a problem! Let me get some help! My god get him out of there! Captain Aronsin's untimely death puts Commander Hollis in charge with Lieutenant Jammad second. Although this is a non-military mission, we are multinationals, therefore we will follow the chain of command prescribed for us by United Federation. As your government representative, I will continue to advise and mediate, should the need for mediation arise. Commander? - Thank you Becker. I'm proud to have served with Captain Arinson. He was a great man, an inspired leader. He died a frontiersman, a long long way from home. We as his traveling companions on our first trip to a new solar system, must carry on, so his death is not in vain. The computers woke us up on schedule. We're approximately seven days from Trion. We'll bury him when we land. Why not bury him in space, Commander? His goal was to reach Trion, he gave his life trying to achieve it. But he devoted his life to space. He will be buried on the planet. Zinovitz, what does your investigation tell you? A simple malfunction killed the captain, Commander. Wait a minute, there's no such thing as a simple malfunction, 200 light years from the nearest service station. What happened? It was a clog in the spiral gasket Reese, the size of a grain of sand. How could that, how could that have happened? Could you determine how long he's been dead? As we saw, the captain's body was badly decomposed Commander. My best estimate is he died 75 light years ago. I've begun skimming the log banks, and those of us with families, will be pleased to know that they're all hibernating comfortably. There's been no record of a malfunction of this type on Earth. Thank God for that. They would have only aged a few months by the time we return. And by the way, Virtual Reality is up, so anybody'd like to take a small mind trip home. And how are things back on Earth, Commander? In terms of the ecosystem, global warming is continuing, although it seems we still have time. And in terms of politics? All appears stable as near as I can tell. The Federation is still intact, and the countries that signed the global treaty are still cooperating. And what do you mean by appears, near as I can tell? Come on Jammad. I haven't finished reviewing the confidential logs, Lieutenant. We've been traveling nearly a century, that's a long time to cover, in a couple of hours. What about Trion, Commander? Well we won't know until we land there. But in the mean time, take a look for yourself. Like Mother Earth must have been when she was young. Salvation at the edge of the universe. We have a lot of work to do in preparation for our landing on Trion, so as soon as Han finishes her examinations we'll eat. You're buying! Let's get to work. Breath in deeply and slowly please. Okay now release quickly. Good. Well Lieutenant Jammad, you are a picture of health. Pretty impressive for 138 years old, wouldn't you say? - Yes. Beautiful! - Vegetation. It's all perfectly fresh. Can you believe it? This looks almost ready for fall market. This is beautiful! Come on Beck, you saw what was going on between Commander Hollis and our Lieutenant. Don't blow it out of proportion. Well don't deny history. Perhaps we've been sleeping for generations but our fathers were not. Some of them were born during the war. Hollis and Jammad were in the same class at the academy. And their grandparents were on opposite sides during the siege of Riyadh. Those that survived... No I think there's more going on there than just schoolboy rivalry Beck. What exactly do you think is going on? Loading file. Transmitting data. Please forgive me, I must join my loved ones. Hollis. My... Get him down! Help me! What the hell, shit! No! - Shit! Where are the clippers, give me the clippers! Now get him down! - Dear god! Come on! Okay, take him over here! Where's Lieutenant Jammad? Right here. You know of course that as second officer, Lieutenant. That puts me in charge. What now Lieutenant? We carry out the commander's orders, we get on with business. And bury him on Trion, along with the captain. That's the way he would have wanted it. Wanted it? Why would Commander Hollis have wanted to die? We have all been dealt, unfortunate setbacks with the death of the captain and the commander. Unfortunate setbacks. Is that the way you look at it Jammad? We must try to place these sad events where they belong, behind us, and as soon as we get back to work the sooner we'll be able to do just that. Now are there any questions, or comments? Ye... I believe it is your responsibility, Lieutenant Jammad, to inform the commander's family of his passing. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. That won't be for another, 100 years. Okay Beck, what do you think of their relationship now? Zinovitz, ever heard of knocking? Yeah, ever heard of murder? Isn't that a little extreme? Aren't you showing just a little bit too much British reserve? And aren't you displaying just a tad too much Russian paranoia? Follow the chain of command, Beck! Two deaths at the top of the ladder is too high a coincidence. Everyone up on deck is thinking the same thing. Why aren't you? - How do you know what I'm thinking? There's something you need to know. I've inspected the captain's hibernation pod. Yes we know, a malfunction in the gasket. I found something more than a malfunction. It was opened some time after we lifted off. You are suggesting... What do you think? What exactly are you asking me for? I need permission to enter the confidential logs. I can't do that. You know regulations, only officers can enter those logs. And who's going to do the review, Jammad? It takes a special court order from Federation government for anyone else to enter. It would take years to transmit by hyperspace. Should we wait years for the opportunity to examine evidence? Z, I cannot, officially give you permission to enter the logs. What are you thinking Reese? Well, I was just figuring out you know, Captain Arinson's been dead for, like three decades. Why the hell hasn't Mission Control figured it out, and done something about it? Contacted us? It's as if we didn't exist. Access denied. Three. And two. - Loading file. Transmitting data. It can't be... What can't be? -... You took me by surprise, I didn't know you were back there. What can't be? - One of the lithium power cells, are in a way I've never seen, I was just scanning circuits. It probably has to do with the lack of gravitational pull in the outer shell. Those files are classified. No, no, they're um, circuit files, they're not classified. Not to the Master Technician. Really we shouldn't, do that. Is there something here that you don't want me to see? No, I suppose not. Transmitting data. Call the others in for a meeting. Yeah. Now we know. What do we know Lieutenant? Why he took the coward's way out. The commander? - Yes, the commander. Come in. Hi. Granier and I, were wondering if you'd like to join us for a cup of tea? Yeah just, just give me a few minutes. Okay. Ever heard of knocking? I did. Z I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm great Beck, why the hell shouldn't I be? The entire human race has been annihilated but, hey when you've got your health you got just about everything. We have a profound challenge now in front of us. Profound. Leave it to a Brit to choose just the right word. I'm extremely concerned. I don't want anymore suicides. He didn't kill himself. Commander Hollis's death was an act of pure irrationality. Han's autopsy showed he died of asphyxiation. I know what the autopsy showed. As a result of the hanging. Stop talking down to me! You found something else? If you did I'd like you to tell me what it is. Someone viewed the confidential log banks before the commander did. How can you tell? The computer records entry and exit times. Can you tell who? So far I've been unable to, it was accessed with a code I've never seen before. But we know who got to the information first, don't we? Bear in mind Z, the consequences of confronting an officer without absolute proof. Aren't we a little beyond consequences now? What I need to know is if I can prove this will you back me up on it? Don't talk to anyone about what you find, until you talk to me. Cloning? - Yes, cloning. Are we forgetting the Klaxton experiments? The Klaxton experiments, I know. - The result was human slugs! Yes I know, inoperative bodies with dysfunctional minds. No no, bodies and minds like putty was more like it! Dr. Han, we're not suggesting cloning humans. Then what are we suggesting here Reese? A cow, an ear of corn is one thing, sustenance. See for humans, there exists a different route. You're talking about propagating. Yes, yes. Why not? Why not? - We, we have the potential, and the resources here, to, to create a new society. I... What? I knew it was going to lead to this! I don't think you guys fully understand what you're suggesting here! They are suggesting survival. The first law of nature, and they're right. We have the ability to generate enough food to feed each other forever, but we have to create that future in order to have it. Adam and Eve would to, would they not? We're six. With who playing God Jammad, you? Without order, there's chaos. Someone's gotta lead. And you took great pains to ensure that it would be you! Watch yourself. - No, Jammad, I'm watching you! What's going on here? My computer is down, the whole god damned system is down! Great, another malfunction. More like someone pulled the plug. Someone Zinovitz? Z, were you able to find out who entered the confidential logs? So close Beck. No? - No! I couldn't get who entered. That's too bad Zinovitz. Hey hey hey hey! Hey come on! No, no, calm down! Stop, stop it, stop! God dammit! Hey, hey, layoff! You get your god damn hands off me! Off! Come on, hey, okay, relax! Okay? - Okay. There'll be no more of that on board this ship! From now on all orders will be taken... Taken from me. What? - I suggest the two of you withdraw to your quarters and calm down. Who put you in charge? United Federation guidelines, section four, paragraph eight, line 17. There's a copy in the library Lieutenant if you need to refresh your memory. As long was we survive, the United Federation survives. And you Lieutenant, are hereby relieved of your command. You want to be in charge Becker, fine. The job's yours. And the rest of you, can follow her, straight to hell. Good. There's nothing good about any of this Zinovitz. I recommend you follow my suggestion as well. Beck... - This is not, I repeat not open for any further discussion. The best thing that could be done now is for you to continue with your work. It's all we have left. That's true, isn't it? I'll be in my quarters if you need me. Man you okay, you all right? No, no! I can take care of myself! Hey Granier let me take a look at that! No I can handle it, you don't think I can handle it? Nobody's saying, Granier. Please, just leave me alone. Here comes the new world Reese, just like the old one. Sorry, sorry. Hey hey! Hey, stop it, stop it! Hey, cool it! Around man, what's going on? What's that about? Hey, hey, you okay? Granier, Granier stop it, hey, hey, what's going on, man? Who's pushing you? Hey, I'm not the bad guy! Neither are you. No. - This isn't about you and me is it? Is it? Inside I feel lost, I feel... Feel lost? - I really feel it, I feel really lost. Yeah, that's all right, I understand. Hey, we're survivors you and me. We're gonna make it, okay? Okay. - All right? All right. And, I'm I'm very sorry I swing at you. That's okay. - I didn't mean it. Its all right, you missed. - I missed! Yeah. - I missed. Next time. There you are. Come on, let's take a walk. Okay. - All right? Okay. Yeah. Let me guess. Sailing on the Seine, or hiking on the Alps? That, was an unfortunate skirmish, it got out of control, I'm sorry I struck you. Yes it was very unfortunate, for my nose especially. Well, you look as if you could use a little mind trip of your own, Lieutenant. You know that American expression all work and no play makes Jammad a dull boy. Yes, yes, I've heard of that. Granier, we've always leveled with each other. Lieutenant, if you have a question, why don't you just come out and ask it? Which side are you on? And if I refuse to choose a side? Well I see you've brought your own little vacation with you, yes? Yes indeed I was planning to pay a visit to an old flame. An old flame, you sly dog, I'll set it up for you. Thank you, it's been so long since I've used this machine that I forgot how to operate it. Yes there you go. You never forget a. Thank you very much. Okay just... Is all right? It's very nice. - Okay. Travel safely. Thank you. Yes, yes... You okay pal? Do you ever think about your cousin? You know, the Bernie who you watched the football with? I try not to. - What about your mother? And your father? Your sisters, and your brothers, and your aunts and your uncles, where do you suppose they were when the shock waves hit? Do you think they were blinded, by the blast, or did they just melt into the scenery, one big, bloody smear of humanity? Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. No Reese, I was thinking just the opposite. Hang on. Reese here. - Reese, I need you and Granier in the galley for a general meeting. Copy that. I'd to begin with progress reports, Zinovitz? This is beginning to sound like the Russia of my great grandparents. Someone needs to regulate. You're telling us that's the reason for a dictatorship? I am not a dictator. Pardon me Your Highness, perhaps I should have said a monarchy. Okay! At least put the issue of how policy changes are handled to a vote. Now Becker, you want to play enforcer, go ahead, be our guest, the role obviously suits you. It will be on official record that I am opposed to this. Fine. - You got it Beck, like the future historians are gonna give a shit. All right, we're gonna vote, Jammad should have his. Last time I see him, he, at the virtual reality chair. Jammad? He's been here for over an hour. Shall I bring him out of it? Not to abruptly. - Slow, slow. He must be pretty deep into it. Maybe he just fell asleep. Lieutenant? What! - Hey there! He's dead. And then there were five. At least if we vote now Becker you don't have to worry about a deadlock! Hey, Zinovitz, this isn't the time. When is Reese, tomorrow? You let me know 'cause I'd hate to miss it if tomorrow never comes. - Ouch, time out! Your findings doctor? Multiple strokes, cardiac arrest, massive trauma to the nervous system. He died of shock? But the system is programmed to read his vital statistics, it should have brought him out immediately, at the first signs of any distress! What in god's name happened to him in there? Whatever it was Reese, it's going to have to remain a mystery. What, again no investigation! We can't find out what he saw, without linking up to his program. And there will be no new mind trips. Somehow I'm not surprised. We can't afford any more accidents. And what makes you so sure it was an accident? The unit is malfunctioning. As of now, it is off limits. Great, great! Jesus! We need to meet. - Don't ever sneak up on someone like that! Shh! But wait! - You ever think of using the intercom? - Quiet! What's going on? - We'll discuss it in the VR room. - That's off limits. I can wire us in, I've already spoken to Han and Granier, they'll be there. Why all the secrecy? - Just come. You all know the deaths of the officers were murder. No. - Murder? No my autopsy showed no evidence of that. She's quite clever. Your autopsies showed asphyxiation and stroke. But did you look any further doctor? Did you? Are you suggesting that Becker is a murderer? Because if you are, you're sounding a bit paranoid. Zinovitz, didn't the unit malfunction? Reese I know this ship like the back of my hand, the unit did not malfunction, Jammad's program was altered. But you, you also have the skill to alter it. And you plugged him in. - I plugged him in! Now you accuse me of killing him! No no... - No, Granier, are you accusing me? No, no! - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait, wait, I'm not accusing anyone! Wait! Sh! What would be Becker's motivation? What always motivates war? War? Land, power, governments making a play for it. And Becker is government. If a situation occurred on Earth, she would be the first one the United Federation contacted. And I don't think they would have waited for her to come out of hibernation. So what are you suggesting? You want a democracy? I say we act like one. We place her under house arrest and we try her. See this sounds to me like, mutiny. Right. - Absolutely. It's not gonna be easy. Overthrowing a government never is. So... - Okay. Anything left to discuss? Yes I think so, I think there is to discuss when, we place her under arrest, and how. Yes Reese? I saw you were working late I thought maybe you'd like a cup of coffee or something. No, thank you. I'm fine. Okay. She's. Yeah, knowing Becker, she'll work all night. Good, she'll be more exhausted. Less likely to put up a struggle. Really. And let's avoid violence if possible. Yeah. Taking off the edge? What are you shooting? Ciladrenal, Jesus Han. Han, you know you could overdose on this stuff, it would kill you! Do you think it really matters? What are we preserving our bodies for? Future generations? My children... Well you're not gonna tell on me are you? Please, please don't tell the teacher! How long have you been taking this? Long enough, I hope. Han, Han, Han! Talk, talk to me! There isn't anybody left to talk to. I am here. I am here to talk to, you know the torment I've been going through, please come out, open up, let me in! Perhaps you'd like to join us for some tea? How much of this did you take? How far into it are you? Far enough. And the tea, is rude, and, the cakes are rising. Granier here. - Is Han coming with you? No she is not well, she is unable to attend, I'll be right there. Is Han okay? A slight fever, it's not contagious. Shall we get on with it then? Yes. The sooner the better. Zinovitz, I expect nothing less than your full attention. Now then, since we are within days of reaching Trion, this is a good time for us to review our individual responsibilities, once we reach there. I've prepared some graphics, which I hope will make everything clear. And our first order of business... By section 23 of the United Federation guidelines I hereby place you under house arrest. What felony are you referring to? Paragraph one, line one. First degree murder. Let go, let go! Let go! You all right? Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Yeah are you? - Yeah. Leave it to the Federation to send an android to watch us. The question is, what do we do with her now? Use her for spare parts. It's too bad we can't put her on trial. So many questions unanswered. I think there is a way. Get it, you got it. Okay. Is it gonna work? It should. It's the right size. Back on autopilot. Yeah? - Yeah. All right. You're good Zinovitz. Thank you. Patient I've almost got it now... How are you feeling now Han, okay? I'm okay Granier. - Good, good. That's it. How long have I been out? You've been programmed to tell the truth, have you not? Yes and to protect it. What the hell's that mean, protect the truth? Hey, answer the question god dammit! By section 31 of the United Federation guidelines I'm only required to answer questions that directly relate to my arrest. No no we are losing patience with you Becker. If you have a question that relates to the case, feel free to ask. What do you know about the deaths of Captain Arinson, Commander Hollis and Lieutenant Jammad? Everything. And did you have anything to do with their deaths? Of course not, their deaths were caused by malfunctions. But Jammad's program was altered. He died when the system failed to react to his distress. But you agreed with my findings. You said that Commander Hollis's death, was a suicide. - Exactly. His brain, like Arinson's hibernation pod, malfunctioned. You're the one who's malfunctioned! No I'm functioning exactly as intended. What do you mean by intended? How much Zinovitz do you know about the inner workings of a Class Seven android like me? Do you know that our brains are equipped with micro-transmitters? For what? For sending signals to severed body parts. Waring, warning! What the hell's that? She's activated the destruct mechanism. Shit! You humans are so predictable. I know exactly what... You can shut the fuck up now. Where's that thing? Over there! - There! Get it off of there! My god I don't believe it! Dammit! - What? Life support systems are completely shut down! Over ride it! I can't! - Issue an order! That's not the way it was programmed! God dammit, now what? Is that it then? - No there is a way! The probe! Life support should be enough to get us to Trion! There is only room for two! No we can double up to fit, I know we can make it! No, I'm staying here! - We can make it work! We're staying here, now go on, take yourselves, there's no time! No! - What are you talking, you're gonna sacrifice yourselves for us, why? Don't you want to see what's out there Granier? Reese, these eyes have seen quite enough. Now go, go! - No, no, there isn't enough time! Go on! - Hurry! I don't understand! Go! Warning, you have 56 seconds to abort destruct! 50, 49, 48, 47, 46 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, Warning, you have 35 - 36, 35, seconds to abort destruct! - 34, 33, 32, 31, 30 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Warning, the option to override self-destruct has now expired. - Okay! You now have 20 seconds to abandon ship. You know have 15 seconds. - Preheat the engine! To reach minimum safe distance. Come on Zinovitz, we got to get the hell out of here now! 10, - We're going to be all right, nine, - we'll be in zero gravity until, when it ignites! - eight, Ready, do it! - seven, Okay ready, go! - six, What, what? - five, four, - We're not disengaging! Three, - Blow us out of here! Use the explosive bolts! - two, one, zero. We've been monitored. Look at the dates. We've only been in hibernation for six months. We've never even left the Earth, have we? The whole thing, the launch, the flight, it's all been one big test. The ultimate psychological evaluation, with us as the Guinea pigs of the Federation. Five people died. I can't believe they would let it go that far. Yeah well, leave it to the human race. Excuse me sir? For this, everyone, everything gone. There's, Nostradamus was wrong.
