- [Man] Now come on baby, let's go for a walk. - [Woman] No baby, it's too spooky out there. - [Man] I'll turn the lights on, come on. - [Woman] No, I don't wanna. - [Man] Come on, come on, just for some fresh air, just for a minute, come on. - Okay, for a minute. (Animal growling) What's that? - Oh it's nothing, here. (Ominous music) (Animal screeches) - What is that? (Animal screaming) (Woman screams) - Oh god. (Animals roaring) (Woman screams) (Animal growling) (Woman screaming) (Animal growling) (Eerie music) (Women groaning) - Doctor, doctor. She's dead. (Dramatic music) - Dead? There is no such thing. Death is a fabrication of the mind. (Suspenseful music) (Women groaning) (Eerie music) Dispose of the body in the usual way. I know you enjoy it. Try to maintain some semblance of dignity. (Ominous music) (Door knocking) - Excuse me, Dr. Blackwood. You have a visitor. - A visitor? Come now Eleanor. No one stops by to visit in the middle of a desert. - Well yes doctor, there's a gentleman here to see you. His name is Taylor and he seems to be a policeman. I mean he's wearing a uniform. - Could you pull yourself together long enough to show the sheriff in? - Yes doctor. (Ominous music) - Welcome to blackwood sanitarium. I'm Arthur blackwood. - I'll try not to take up too much of your time. Get right to the point. We've had a double murder. - We, sheriff? No, no. Maybe you have had a double murder. I've had no such thing. We here at blackwood are totally removed from that type of violence. - Not anymore, doctor. Two people were brutally murdered and their bodies horribly mutilated. - Really sheriff, I don't think that... - Now these murders occurred last night and less than half a mile from this castle. - Sanitarium. - Whatever you call it. Now the point... - The point is this. Blackwood sanitarium, I didn't say castle, blackwood sanitarium is not a lunatic asylum. It's a rest home for emotionally disturbed people. Just because a couple of young people get themselves killed you immediately assume that one of my patients... - Young people? - What? - I never said anything about the victims being young people. (Arthur chuckles) - You sound like Charlie chan. Now I'm supposed to break down and confess. - [Taylor] Why did you say young people? - Sheriff, I've lived here for seven years. I've never known of anyone but young people to be out in that desert at night. I understand that the road between here and the main highway has turned into a veritable lovers' Lane. So naturally I assumed... - Naturally. (Suspenseful music) Before I leave I'd like to have a few words with your nurse and your patients. - Impossible! I won't have my patients excited in any way. I've told you that they're all harmless. Besides, they're locked in their rooms every night by my nurse and Eleanor is above suspicion. - If they're so harmless doctor, why do you lock them up at night? - For their own protection. - Alright, I won't disturb them for now. But I'd like to post a guard outside. - That won't be necessary. We have no fear and I'm perfectly capable of defending my home. - Nevertheless, I intend to put two men outside to guard the area. Let's just say it'll make me feel better. - Of course sheriff. Anything to make you feel better. - [Taylor] Thank you. Can I use your phone? - Help yourself. (Cat meows) Surprised? It's no accident of nature, this is my work. Taming the savage instincts in animals and humans. - Well I'm all for that. Just don't get to be too good at it. You might put me out of work. (Arthur chuckles) - [Arthur] What a pleasant prospect. (Suspenseful music) - Arthur, why can't I... Do we have company? - It's alright. Sheriff Taylor, may I present my sister, melody blackwood. - Are you a real sheriff? - As far as I know. How do you do, miss blackwood? - [Arthur] Sheriff was just leaving. - I didn't know you had a sister living here. I'd like to ask her a few questions. - [Arthur] Of course, by all means ask melody a few questions. Melody, answer the sheriff's questions like a good girl. - Is this a game? - [Arthur] I'm not sure, but I think so. - No, it's not a game miss blackwood. A terrible tragedy has happened and I need your help. I wanna know if you've seen or heard anything unusual. - Oh yes I did, I did Arthur, something very unusual. - You saw or you heard something? - Yes, I saw or I heard something. - I don't understand. - [Arthur] Go ahead melody, tell the nice sheriff what you saw or heard. - Please, miss blackwood, it's very important. - I know. Now I remember. - What miss blackwood, what is it? R I had a Dolly j' r sweet as could be j' j' I lost my Dolly j' I now I have none I (Arthur clapping) - [Arthur] Good melody, very good. Does that answer your question, sheriff? - I'm sorry doctor, I didn't realize. - Don't be sorry, sheriff. I'm not. When melody was 12 years old she was as dangerous and vicious as a jungle beast. My parents couldn't afford treatment. They didn't want to lose her. So they simply chained her in her room like an animal. If anyone got near her she would claw their faces to ribbons, claw and bite and scratch. You see this scar, sheriff? When I was 20 years old I decided to free my little sister. I made the mistake of removing the chains from her hands before I removed the chains from her mind. That's when I decided to become a psychiatrist. - [Taylor] I'd like to go through the castle some day. - I'll take you through the sanitarium someday. Goodbye, sheriff. - Goodbye. For now. Miss blackwood. - Oh hello. My name is melody. - Happy to meet you. - I'm happy too. - Goodbye. (Eleanor gasps) I'd like to ask you a few questions. - I really don't know anything. - Well maybe not but I think you could help me. - Melody, did you go to the cave last night? - I had to Arthur, to see my friend. - Melody, I ask you not to let your friend out without my permission. - But my friend gets so restless at night. I had to Arthur. I had to. - Then you did let your friend out. - Was I a bad girl, Arthur? - Bad girl? No, melody. You may be the best girl who ever lived. You're a very good girl. - You're a good boy too, Arthur. (Patient whimpering) (Suspenseful music) (Woman screaming) (Dramatic music) (Dramatic music) - I think Taylor finally flipped his lid. Those killers are a thousand miles from here by now. And we're guarding this nuthouse. - Well you think the sheriff's crazy. What about that blackwood creep? I mean, imagine actually wanting to live in a mausoleum. - Yeah well the doc can't be too crazy. His wife is coming in tonight and that goofy chauffeur showed me her picture before he left. She looks like she could keep a lotta guys happy. - Yeah well maybe she's loony too. And what's with that chauffeur? I mean why can't he talk? - I dunno. He didn't say. I wonder what goes on inside this place. I mean what really goes on. - I dunno. Maybe the doctor is creating a monster. (Man laughs) - Somehow that's not funny. (Eerie music) - Is your friend getting restless? - Oh yes Arthur. How did you know? - I always know. Later tonight, you'd better let your friend out for a walk. (Suspenseful music) - Surely we're not there. I mean this is the middle of nowhere. Why have you stopped the car? Alright Ernest, let's go. Dr. Blackwood is waiting. (Car starts) - Doctor, they're here. - Go to your room Eleanor. I wanna be alone with Diane. - Who are you, ma'am? - I'm Dr. Blackwood's wife. - They're okay. (Gentle music) - Arthur, I'm so happy to see you. - I thought you'd never get here. How was your trip? - [Diane] Oh it was wonderful. (Dramatic music) - I can't believe you're here. - I can't either. And this place, it's unbelievable! I also wanna say that man you sent to pick me up is pretty unbelievable too. - Did Ernest upset you? - Well no not really, he's just unusual. - The main thing is you are here. - Oh. Arthur, those men outside. They said they were deputies. Why are they here? - Oh it's nothing. There was some trouble in the desert last night. Those men are just investigating. - Trouble? What kind of trouble? - A couple of kids were killed. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with us. We are in no danger. - Does someone think we are? I mean, in danger? Is that why those men are outside? - No. They'll be gone soon. Now, I want you to meet my little sister melody. I told you about her, remember? - Your star patient. Oh, I'd love to meet her. - Alright, you sit right here... - Here? - And I'll go get her. (Suspenseful music) - Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Is it about the murders? I heard them talking about them. - You startled me, I'm sorry. - Don't worry. There'll be more murders. More blood. - Yes yes, of course. I'm Dr. Blackwood's wife. My name is Diane, and you are? - Dr. Blackwood? I'm Edith. I'm not supposed to be here. I must go back to my room now. But I did hear them talking about murders and blood. Shh. (Eerie music) (Door creaks) (Diane sighs) - When you marry a psychiatrist. - What happens when you marry a psychiatrist? - Well, when you marry a psychiatrist you meet the prettiest young ladies. - This is my sister melody, melody this is Diane. - She's beautiful. You, you look like my Dolly. - Oh melody, we're gonna be such good friends. - Oh I hope so Dolly. - Alright you two. Melody will take you up to your room. I'll have Ernest bring your luggage up, and you can both get ready for dinner. We're gonna be one happy family. - We are aren't we? One happy family. (Door thuds) (Ominous music) (Man laughing) (Eerie music) (Dramatic chord) (Eerie music) (Man crying out) (Woman crying out) (Man chuckling) (Dramatic music) - I'll fix you. I'll admit you've suffered, you've suffered badly. (Dramatic music) (Woman screaming) (Dramatic music) (Whip cracking) (Dramatic music) - Carl! Put Eva back in her cell. Or would you rather I told Dr. Blackwood about this? (Dramatic music) - [Carl] Here, got a present for you. (Men laughing) (Suspenseful music) - Now go to the cave, let your friend out. - Can't you come with me Arthur? - You know I can't. Your friend doesn't like anyone but you. Your friend might try to hurt me. Now go, quickly. (Dramatic music) (Diane gasps) - Get away, get away from me! (Diane screams) (Dramatic music) (Diane crying) (Dramatic chord) (Diane screams) (Dramatic music) - Diane, what is it? - Oh Arthur, thank god! Get me out of this house! Take me away from here, it's horrible, I'm so frightened! - Hold it, hold it! Just tell me what happened. - Everything. That man in the cage. (Dramatic music) - Darling there's no one here. - Arthur, I saw a man in that cage. A bearded man, I saw him. - That's quite possible. Two of my patients have beards. It could have been Mr. Stone or professor zucker. They're both quite harmless. - Well maybe so. But your man Ernest is not harmless. - Ernest? What do you mean? - Well he came into the bedroom, he turned out the lights, and he was going to... - Don't worry about Ernest. He wouldn't really harm you. Maybe he has a crush on you. I'll talk to him. I promise you, Ernest will never bother you again. (Gun firing) - Arthur. Those were gunshots. - Alright. I'll take a look. (Suspenseful music) (Man screaming) (Animal snarling) - What is it Arthur? - It's nothing, just those ridiculous deputies. A little target practice. It's all over now. - Good. Now maybe we can get some sleep. - I'm sorry doctor, I told him! - It's alright Eleanor, wait outside. Now really sheriff, I think you should explain. - No wrong, blackwood! You are going to explain. (Suspenseful music) - Oh no! (Woman screaming) - I've seen a lot of dead bodies, doctor. Mutilated bodies. Accident victims. I've never seen anything like this. Never. - But what could have happened? I mean, who could have done such a thing? - What is it Arthur, what's wrong? - [Arthur] Now don't get excited. Nothing is wrong. - On the contrary Mrs. - Blackwood, everything is wrong. (Eerie music) Do you recall nurse did anyone leave the sanitarium during the night? - No sir. I locked all the patients in their rooms. Ernest's room's across from mine and I would have heard him if he'd gone out. I'm a very light sleeper. - And Dr. Blackwood and I were together all night. So you see... - And melody, is she locked in at night? (Melody giggles) - [Arthur] Now leave us alone. - Sorry doctor, I'm leaving, but you're not off the hook, yet. (Suspenseful music) (Man babbles) Who are you? - Fine, thanks, who are you? - Did any of you hear anything unusual or see anyone walking around outside the castle last night? - I did. - You did? - I did what? - Look I'm sheriff Taylor and I'd like a little help. Did you see anyone walking around last night? Maybe through your window. - I saw Dr. Blackstone. - You mean Dr. Blackwood. -I do? - What was Dr. Blackwood doing? - When? - Last night. You remember, last night. - No, I don't think so. - You're wasting your time, sheriff. Mr. Barrett has a block. He doesn't remember anything he doesn't like and he doesn't like anything. He's perfectly happy because he lives only in the present. Two seconds ago is the past as far as Mr. Barrett is concerned. And the past is immediately buried somewhere in the dark recesses of his brain. Isn't that right, Mr. Barrett? - Isn't what right? - You see, sheriff? - I see, doctor. - Are you here about the murders? - Yes I am. - There'll be more murders, more blood. - Why do you say that? - [Arthur] Tell him Edith, tell him how you know. - Shh. I'm not supposed to be here. - [Taylor] Happy doctor? Have you had your little laugh? - If you care to question my other patients I'm sure you'll find them equally responsive. There's nothing here for you, sheriff. - I'll talk to you later, doctor. - There's nothing here for you! (Suspenseful music) Zolock. (Suspenseful music) Come on Mr. Zolock. (Suspenseful music) Mr. Zolock. Easy, come on. (Suspenseful music) (Man growling) (Carl cries out) (Suspenseful music) - I want you to watch this. I've tried to warn you all. Evil must be destroyed. (Woman screaming) (Eerie music) Ernest. Come here. I hear you paid my wife a little visit last night, Ernest. That was very unwise. Now you will have to be punished again. You know I don't like to punish you, it hurts me terribly. Do you enjoy hurting me? No, and yet you do it. Even you, my old friend, are filled with evil thoughts. (Arthur sighs) Alright. Go to your room. I'll be along shortly. (Dramatic music) Justice has been done. And the serpent beguiled the woman and she did eat of the fruit and she gave also unto the man and he did eat. You shouldn't have tempted Mr. Zolock. (Suspenseful music) Now it's your turn. (Suspenseful music) Now Mr. Zolock you will notice the candle burning the rope. Very slowly. Burning as your soul will burn in hell if you do not repent. (Zolock crying out) Be not afraid of them that kill the body. Fear him which hath power to cast into hell. Now, watch the blade. As it comes down you will be purified. Give up your evil beliefs, now! There isn't much time but it's not too late. Hurry Mr. Zolock! Repent, now! (Zolock screaming) (Dramatic music) And if thy righteye offend thee, pluck it out (whimpering) And cast it from thee. (Ernest screaming) (Eleanor screams) Eleanor, what's the matter? Answer me right now! - Oh my god the cage, oh! - What about the cage? (Hand slaps) (Eleanor cries out) What about the cage? Tell me about the cage, Eleanor. - Yes doctor, I'm sorry. The cage where you keep the cat and the mouse together. You know, I went into feed them. And the cat, the cat had been ripped to shreds! Just like it had been through a meat grinder! It was hideous. - And the mouse, what about the mouse? - Oh the mouse was just sitting there as if nothing had happened. How can that be, doctor? What could have done such a thing? - I want you to forget the whole thing, Eleanor. - The cat was just ripped apart. Just detectives and that young couple. I better call sheriff Taylor. Somehow this is connected with those murders. I've got to call the sheriff, I'm frightened there's something in this house! - There's no need to call anybody! Now go to your room! - Let me go! I'm calling sheriff Taylor! - You're going to your room. No I'm not, let me go! (Suspenseful music) (Eleanor crying) - Come on! (Suspenseful music) (Eleanor crying) I told you to wait in your room. - I'm not one of your patients, Arthur. Was all that necessary? - She was hysterical. - Tell me about the cat and the mouse. - She was hysterical, now get back in your room. - Yes, Dr. Blackwood. - Please darling, I'm quite upset. The cat and the mouse were an experiment. I'll tell you all about it when the experiment's completed. Now go to bed. I have some work to do and I'll join you when it's finished. - Alright Arthur. And Eleanor? - Tomorrow she'll be a new woman. I'll apologize to her in the morning. Now run along and let me get to work. - Yes Arthur. I'll run along. (Dramatic music) - We're going to let your friend out again tonight. - I wish my friend didn't have to come back. My friend would like to stay out for a long time. - Soon melody, soon. - Oh I hope so, Arthur. (Door creaks) (Suspenseful music) - Guess who. - Oh you scared me. Ready for bed yet? - Yes. I am definitely ready for bed. In fact, I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight. - You seem awfully happy. Good news? -Mmhmm. Very good news. My work is progressing beautifully. (Dramatic music) (Door knocking) (Dramatic music) (Eleanor gasping) (Eleanor screaming) (Dramatic music) - I'm telling you she's gone, vanished! I went to her room this morning and she wasn't there. Sheriff, I know something's happened to her. - I'm very busy with this murder investigation. Are you sure she didn't just go into town? - She had no way of getting into town. Listen sheriff, I don't have much time. There was a scene last night... (Ominous music) - Hello sheriff, this is Dr. Blackwood. I'm afraid my wife is a little confused. - I'm a little confused too. Where is your nurse? - Eleanor became quite hysterical last night. All this murder business. I was forced to lock her in her room. About five o'clock this morning I became concerned about her. So I paid her a visit. She told me she wanted to leave my employ. Naturally I agreed. I even offered to find her another job some place else. She insisted on leaving then and there. - May I speak to your wife again? - Of course. Diane. - Yes sheriff? - Are you absolutely satisfied with that explanation? - No, of course not. I'm sorry to have bothered you sheriff. I'm sure Eleanor will turn up some place. Goodbye. (Suspenseful music) - Alright, now I have things to do. I'm taking in my patients to the county hospital today. - Couldn't Ernest drive them in? - No, Ernest is, I've given him the day off. I'll take them in this afternoon and I'll be back sometime tonight. I want you to stay here with melody. I don't like to leave her alone. - Alright Arthur. Anything you say. (Suspenseful music) (Engine rumbling) (Suspenseful music) - You don't know my friend. Nobody does. My friend lives under the castle. - Under the castle? You mean, there's no basement in this castle. Is there? Melody, are you making this up? - No, I never tell lies. Lies are bad. - But how do you get under the castle? - Through the books. I go through the books. - Oh you mean you read about them. - I never read anything. But I could show you. - Alright melody, show me. - I said I could, I didn't say I would. Arthur might get mad at me. - Why would Arthur get angry? - Because he told me never to show anybody. - But melody, I'm not just anybody. I'm your new sister. Arthur loves me and he loves you so we're one happy family, remember? - One happy family, I remember! Arthur said that! Alright, I'll show you. Just as soon as Arthur gets back. - Oh please melody, show me now. We can surprise Arthur when he gets home. - I like surprises. Alright, but I can't go with you. I'm only allowed to go at night. - Alright. (Suspenseful music) - See? I never tell lies. - Good melody. You stay here, right in the office, and I'll be back in a few minutes. - You won't find my friend. Not in the daytime. - Maybe not. But I'll find something. You just stay here. (Melody giggles) (Suspenseful music) (Suspenseful music) - [Arthur voiceover] So far only melody has responded to the drug. I am keeping the more violent patients locked in the dungeon between the laboratory and the cave entrance. I may have to destroy these people in order to save their souls. It's strange but when I saw Mr. Zolock's head severed from his body, I felt a definite sexual thrill. I must be very careful not to become like the thing I hate most. (Suspenseful music) (Diane screaming) (Eerie music) (Eerie music) - I'm sorry I'm so late. That idiot sheriff stopped me on the road and asked me a lot of ridiculous questions. I want you to... (Suspenseful music) - [Diane] Yes Arthur darling? You want me to what? - What have you done? - What have you done? - [Arthur] You don't understand anything. - No I don't. Suppose you tell me. Tell me about that tunnel and the cave and the laboratory. Everything! Tell me Arthur, tell me about the murders. - Alright. I'll tell you everything. But first call that sheriff and get him off my back. I need a little more time. - No Arthur, you explain things to me first. Then I'll call the sheriff. - Alright. (Mysterious music) (Arthur sighs) Where to start? I've been working for years on the theory that all men are basically good. Perfect creations of a perfect god. But that all mortals entertain a sense of evil. They believe evil, therefore they experience it. This sense of evil is lurking in their subconscious, ready to come out at any time. I believe that if we could remove this false sense of evil we would behold a perfect man, good and pure in every way. - Very idealistic for a doctor. - Idealistic only because I was dealing with intangibles. Thoughts. But if evil could become tangible, substance, if it could be isolated in a material form, it could be destroyed. - But you know that's impossible. - Impossible? My dear, I've done it. - But how? What do you mean? - I have managed to take a sense of evil, isolate it, materialize it, and control it. - And those people, the cat, Eleanor? Those murders? - Those murders were committed by no one! No person! Only a, a sense of evil that's wandered into the desert. It was tragic of course, but the end results! - Will justify the means? - Surely you see how important this is. Now please! If you love me, call the sheriff. - Alright Arthur. I'll call the sheriff. I'll do this because I love you. (Rotary phone dialing) - Good girl. Tell him we've heard from Eleanor. Tell him everything is alright. Tell him... - Sheriff Taylor please. Mrs. Arthur blackwood. - [Arthur] You won't regret this Diane. You're going to be very proud of me. - Hello, sheriff? I'm calling about those murders. About Eleanor. My husband Dr. Blackwood killed them all. He's been taking some sort of drug. Sheriff, he's insane! I love you Arthur! - You fool! You stupid, ignorant little fool! I thought you would understand! - I don't! - Now you leave me no choice! - Arthur no! I don't, stop! (Dramatic music) (Diane crying out) (Suspenseful music) (Dramatic music) (Whacks) (Dramatic music) (Sirens blaring) (Dramatic music) (Dramatic music) (Siren blaring) (Dramatic music) (Dramatic music) (Sirens blaring) (Dramatic music) (Diane screams) (Dramatic music) (Sirens blaring) (Dramatic music) (Dramatic music) (Diane screams) (Dramatic music) - Melody, listen to me. Go out there and tell them, tell the sheriff that I have to stay in here. - Alright Arthur. You'll come out later? - Someday. Here, take these with you. Don't show them to anyone but Dr. Turley. Give them to him and to no one else. And melody. Everything I've ever done, I did for you. Do you understand that? - Yes Arthur. You're my only brother. - Go now, quickly. (Suspenseful music) - Alright blackwood. I'm gonna blow up the cave. Come out blackwood. (Suspenseful music) Come on! - Alright children, I'm gonna let you all out. We're going to play a little game. Now we don't have much time. Charles, Charles don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, come on Charles. We don't have much time, you know what we have to do. Just put your arm up here, that's it. This will only take a few minutes, we haven't much time now. Please don't be frightened. Now quickly, girls, quickly now. Don't be frightened. Eva, come with me Eva. Come on. Come on, this is all a game, you know that, it's just a game, none of this is real. - This is your last chance. Come out or get blown to bits. - Very good, very good. And now it's almost over, it's almost over, we're almost there, all of us. We're going to all be free in a few minutes. Free. (Suspenseful music) It's all your fault! You and your evil! (Woman screaming) (Dramatic music) (Woman screams) (Dramatic music) (Cave booms) (Dramatic music) - Well he was in there alright. We found enough to make a positive identification. I'm very sorry. - No you're not. Neither am I. He was like a mad dog. He had to die. I'm glad it's over. - What will you do now? - Go home. I'll be leaving in the morning. - You mind staying here tonight? I could find a place for you in town. - I don't mind. I'm not alone. I I'll find my Dolly r I and we will be I - I still have melody. J' happy together r I Dolly and me I - I'm taking her to New York with me. I'm going to care for her until she's well. (Diane sighs) That's the least I can do for Arthur. - Let me know if I can help. Call and I'll send a car for you in the morning. I'm surprised that the explosion didn't destroy this entire castle. Maybe it should have. - Maybe so. Well goodbye sheriff, and thank you so much. - Goodbye, ladies. - Melody, I have a call to make. Now you run upstairs and get all your dollies and clothes together. I'll be up to help you in a few minutes. - Will Arthur really come out of the cave someday? He said he would. - I don't know. Maybe someday. Run along now. Hello, operator? I'd like New York City please. The number is 876-9056. Person to person to Mrs. Barbara Elliot. Thank you. Alright, keep trying operator and call me back. Thank you. Melody? Is that you? (Suspenseful music) (Suspenseful music) (Diane crying out) (Suspenseful music) (Animal snarling) (Dramatic music) (Diane screams) I Dolly is gone I
