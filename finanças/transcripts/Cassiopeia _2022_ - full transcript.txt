The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep. Mr. Kim Yes. No, more than $100 million won't do. Once the sales procedure begins, you can't avoid the restructuring. Yes, we'll revise the contract and send it over. And the... The... What was it? The... Anyway, we'll do it at Northbeck. Yes. I'll give them a call around noon local time. Okay. Dad, I can't find Gina. The babysitter's not answering, either. Didn't you say you took her... Maybe it wasn't today... Sorry, dad. I found Gina. No, it's okay. I'm hanging up. Okay. Got you! Oh, you scared me. Come on. You're not a baby anymore. I don't want to go... You told your dad you wanted to go, right? I wanted to go with you. You the one who told your dad that you'd go. A lady should keep her word. Okay. I'll go! I said, I don't feel like going, not that I won't. Mom, it's raining. I really like the sound of rain. When I feel like crying, I hold it in and cry when it rains. That way no one will know. Then it should rain everyday. CASSIOPEIA Gina, wake up! You're meeting David with your friends. Is this our last time being together? Ouch... it hurts. Who's going to tie your hair in the States? I'm not going to tie my hair! You can't just bail on me all of a sudden. That's your problem. No, it's fine. No, please don't come. I wouldn't have hired you if I knew how irresponsible you were. No! Don't come back! I'll handle this myself. Counsellor, the executive office, today. David, I need a favor. Can you pick up Gina at the apartment? Just this one time. 2 hours early. It's okay. We just got their response. I guess the Northbeck reacquisition case is now closed. Yes. Good work. You're at your peak these days. Keep it up! Yes, sir. Dad. Can you look after Gina? The babysitter bailed on me again. Sure. Don't be late, like last time. Okay, okay. - Where are you going? - I need to pick up Gina. Hold on. I'll give you a ride to the station. It's fine, Mi-ja will get mad at you again. I'd rather have my wife get mad at me than your daughter. Just hold on. I'm going to be late again because of him. Hold on. I'll only take a minute. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a tiger by the toe. If you ever let it go, eeny, meeny, miny, moe! Grandpa! Oh, my sweetie pie! Catch him! Why are you so late? Am I? Your mother said I shouldn't let you watch cartoons. If you don't tell her, she'll never know. You want me to lie? No, it's not a lie. Just don't tell her. Alright. If she asks, I won't tell her. How embarrassing. You're a big girl and you can't even eat on your own. I'm still a baby. Didn't you watch this last time? Yeah, it's "Finding Dory". Oh, the movie about a fish finding her mother? How does she find her? Well... By swimming? She teaches her a song. To follow the shells. Oh, right, right. You're here already? You said you'll be late. Did she do her homework? Did you check? I was going to after dinner. I told you she should eat at the table. It was only for a while. Gina, let's eat at the table. Gina. Did you write your diary? You said I don't have to write diaries anymore! When did I say that? You're always like that! Mom wants to send me away to the States as soon as possible. Will she come find me? Let's make sure she can. How? Well, in the past, people followed stars to find a path. I know. They followed the North Star. Right, that's what I told you. But how do you find the North Star? Cassiopeia. Right. Cassiopeia. The brightest constellation. Cassiopeia. Have you talked to the babysitter? I fired her. Do you want me stay until next week? Would it be easy to find someone to work just for a week? It's fine. Alright. Dad... Would that be okay with you? Sure. I don't mind. Come on... Stop whining. Grandpa's coming to our house because of you. Why's that because of me? - It's because of you! - It's because of me. I wanted to be with Gina. Why do I have to go to cram school on Saturday? David said he'll teach you English games. They're English lessons! They're not games! Stop pretending they're games! They are not games! You're so stubborn. What's wrong with you? Gosh. I didn't say anything. You go to cram school with grandpa. You must be really upset. I'm sorry that you can't meet Bit-na because of me. We've been friends for more than five years. Do you have a friend like that? Well, I have many friends I haven't seen for over five years. What? How are you friends with them if you haven't seen them for five years? When you grow old, there's nothing to do even if you meet up with your friends. You played so much that it's not fun anymore? Well... I guess it's not that exciting. I feel bad for you, Grandpa. Before mom passed away, - did you guys get to do all this? - No. Why not? Well, time just flew. What's the use anyway. Oh, when your mom had it tailored, she said she'll pass it onto you. She talked about it a lot. She wanted you to wear it. No one wears suits like that these days. Grandpa! Gina. Mom, have you called Bit-na's mom? Do you only think about hanging out with your friends when you have so much to do before leaving? But mom, you promised! Hanging out with friends is the most important thing for kids. Why disrespect that? Aren't I right? You heard her? I don't know... Don't make this hard for me. Do you want me to be unhappy? Wow, did you hear that? That's not the right spelling. I wrote my diary with grandpa. Is mom unhappy because of me? No, she's just not good with words. How can a lawyer not be good with words to her child? Even if she gets old, I won't be mean to her. All right. So you want to make up? Did we even fight? Mom, we always fight. Geez... That's Cassiopeia. The brightest one. If you follow it, you can find the North Star. If you find the North Star, you know your way. I see. You can always see it in the summer. Should we go see it? I'll show you. The Cassiopeia. He's a good character. Good with the kids. He's getting paid a lot for it. So you pay him to teach them play around? Mom... Mom, I'm so tired. - Do you want to go home? - No... Mom, I hid a gift for you in this playground. What is it? Try to find it when I'm away. I even marked it. Really? I'll find it, then. Don't forget you promised! Of course! I'm not a baby! What song is that? Oh? Cassiopeia. Ms. Park taught me.

My English notebook. Didn't you brush your teeth a while ago? Grandpa always brushes his teeth at 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. - Why? - It's a habit. Even if your brain's dead, your body remembers. It's good to have a routine, so that your body remembers. Why? I feel alive that way. I don't get it. Calling your mom should be your routine. - Okay. - My little sweetie pie. Gina. You're going to miss the plane. Until the last day? Come on. Did you tell her dad to come to the airport? Yes. - Yes. - Send me that Miracle files now. Right now, it's urgent! I need to get to the airport. I know. So send it to me now. Why are you asking me that now? I said I need to go to the airport! Just send it, quick! Mom, we're going to miss the plane. Oh... What is it? Mr. Kim's asking what time you'll be here. Tell him that I'll be there in the afternoon. It's afternoon now, so he's looking for you. Then let him wait until the end of the night! You know what day it is today. So why are you doing this to me? You give me tons of work and make me drink a lot, too! Am I a slave? Tell him the exact words. "Am I your slave?" Hello? I'm going back now. Dad! Where are you? We need to go to the airport now! What? Where did you take Gina? What are you talking about? I'm on my way home after shopping for groceries. Dad, are you out of your mind? What groceries? Bring Gina here now! We're going to miss the plane! Su-jin. What's wrong with you? Dad! I'm not in the mood to joke around! Are you joking with me because Gina asked you to? Why would I do that? Dad, where are you? I'll come get you. What's going on with you? What's wrong with you? Where the hell are you? How could you take Gina somewhere else? Su-jin, what's wrong? Su-jin! Dad, wait outside. We actually need a guardian to stay. I'm okay. I just have a stiff neck. Do you get regular checkups? Yes. Is it... Cancer? According to the accident report, you confused the break as the accelerator. Yes. Do you often forget things? I don't know. Sometimes? Just like anyone else. What's the issue? Ms. Park, I suspect you have Alzheimer's. Sorry? If you take a look here. We call this part, mesiotemporal. And progressive brain atrophy can be seen in that area. In the blood test, we found positive amyloid protein. These results indicate that you do have Alzheimer's dementia. Doctor, I'm still in my thirties. How could I have dementia? It's called presenile dementia. Unlike other types of dementia, presenile dementia develops at a faster rate. Much faster. So in these cases, how fast does it get worse? Three months? If longer, between one or two years. I can't come in to work today. What? What's wrong? Why not? Hello? Hey! I said I'm not going! Damn it! What did you just say? What's wrong with you? I said I can't go so don't call me! You should watch what you say. Elegant woman like you don't speak that way. She got there okay? Yeah. - She didn't cry? - Nope. I didn't cry, either? No. Am I getting punished? Because I'm a sinner? I lived my ass off, right? Of course you did. You made me proud. I lived my ass off more than anyone else! I survived without you or mom! I know, I know. I knows that very well. But why? Why? Why on earth is this happening to me? Draw 9:20 on this clock What's the date today? My dementia isn't that bad yet. Not asking because I think you don't know. Follow after me. I took a plane and got off at the airport, took a cab and went home. I took a plane... and arrived at the airport, took a cab and went home. What's the rice cake, we eat on Thanksgiving called? Dumplings? It's Songpyeon. What are you going to take to go home today? I'll take... The thing I can call... A taxi, right? Alzheimer's... can't be cured. The usual treatment is to slow down the progress. From now on, you're going to forget things a lot, and have emotional swings. They're going to happen quite often. It's because of your illness, so don't panic. Just take the pill. Taxi... Taxi... We're in a taxi. Yes, a taxi. This is a taxi. The plane landed safely, and dad got here on time. So you don't have to worry about me. I'm not worried. If you don't, then you should stop nagging. I'll be nagging her from now on. Gina made a friend once she got here. Dad! It's a secret. Why is that a secret? Go on, tell mom now. Yeah, tell your mom. What's her name? Rachel. She used to live in Korea before. Wow that's amazing. Good for you. Mackerel, dark chocolate, nuts... Counsellor... Sorry about yesterday. I had to get to the airport. I went through the contractual obligations last night.. I wasn't able to check all the emails but... Counsellor Park. Yes? Are you in your proper attires? What were you thinking? I'll go buy some clothes. You think now's a good time to go shopping? Should I just walk around naked? Do you have the slightest idea... Never mind, forget it. If the prosecutor calls, I'll just say you went shopping. Everybody go shopping. Get out. I'm on my own. Now, can you sit? Slowly, slowly. Can you lift your legs up? - Great job, mom. - Very well. The other leg too. Thank you. Mom, you're going to be with me in the weekends. - You'll be alright alone? - Yeah, I'm fine. Keep it up. - Excuse me. - Yes? Is there a program I can take about dementia this month? Oh, no. But next month, you can. - The seats are full this month? - Yes, unfortunately. Do you have a family member with dementia? You must be new... Is it your mother? Or your wife? I'll try signing up next month. He can still come to the support group meetings. We have a support group for the patients' family members. You should come. It helps to be with others like you. You're here early. I'm tired. It's not bad. I'll get a caregiver so don't worry too much. I'm alright. I'll need to get a new babysitter too. She's so on her own. So irresponsible. Her husband used to be head of a bank or something. She said she was called a first lady. But see, she makes shitty ramen for Gina. Gina's allergic to wheat flour, so I don't even let her have donuts. That's why I don't send her to the States even when her dad begs me to. September 14th, 7:23 PM. Su-jin doesn't remember that Gina went to the States. September 15th, 5:35 PM. Su-jin's looking for Gina, who's in the States. September 15th, 6:48 PM. I keep thinking about how I should behave in front of her. I'm not sure yet. I'm just writing them down. What? The front door lock... I'll have it changed tomorrow. Why? There are much better locks now. Like fingerprint scanners. Because you think I'll forget the passcode? I get confused, too. Change it then. Counsellor... To the meeting room today. The Miracle overseas branch in 2017? Yes. You should be careful in the heydays. You're right. Even corporate law firms can't get away with the search. Just one mistake, you're accused of being an accomplice. I'll begin recording. Why are you recording? Are you here for an interrogation? Stay still. Hello. I'm Park In-woo. Welcome. Let's give him a hand. Tell us about the patient. Is it your parents or your wife? She's my daughter. The South African branch of Northbeck was sold in 2019. So, the Miracle Group was accused of money laundering and tax evasion. They used a subsidiary to attract more investment. Many corporations with subsidiaries use this strategy. Weren't you aware that Northbeck was under investigation? Oh, your daughter? Yes, my daughter is the dementia patient. Please tell us about your daughter, then. Northbeck's owner is Ms. Shim, wife of Miracle Group chairman Ryan. Did you advise that she should be appointed CEO? I don't remember. I was quite shocked. How could she have dementia? But I did some research. Nowadays, a lot of young people get Alzheimer's. The indictment notice was served in December, 2016... Northbeck was established in 2017. My daughter was very intelligent. She's a lawyer. You must have received the indictment notice. Well... I... I wasn't feeling well. You weren't? What about now? I don't remember... You don't remember getting the indictment notice? I never forced her to study. She passed the bar all on her own. I worked abroad for a long time. I built marine facilities for over 30 years. I never got to see her grow up. I think I may have made a mistake because of my illness. I'm not in a healthy condition. You don't remember because you were sick? Don't push her too hard. She's cooperating with you. - I'm not. - Are you interrogating her? Let's call it a day. I'll put the files together and sent it to you. I got... Alzheimer's. I have Alzheimer's. One day she grew up and told me, she's a lawyer now. I said, that's quite amazing. Then one day she tells me, she has a daughter. I said, is that true... Thank you. Then now... She has Alzheimer's. I said... I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I said, let's get through this together. So, here I am. During sales, you didn't mention that it was under indictment or investigation... So... you really don't remember the indictment notice letter? No. What are you going to do? What? If I prove that the legal agent was incapable of receiving the indictment letter, prove her incapability due to Alzheimer's disease, then the contract should be recognized as valid. Why do you say that? So you want us to use you to save all our asses? That's what you're going to do. Damn it! Why are you making me a jerk! Are you not? Okay, fine then. I can't fight you. - Thank you. Get home safe. - See you again. Take it. It's free. Thank you. I'll see you next time. No... Do you need help? No. Okay. - Dad. - Yes? Can you stay with me? Of course. It might be easier for you to not see me. I've had an easy life all along. Why do you always brush your teeth at 11? A senior at work told me that the secret to success is always putting on your left sock first. That is, if you put meanings to small things each day, and recognize it, you're life changes. Once you start recognizing even just meaningless activities, each day becomes meaningful. So did your life change? Well, I'm just brushing my teeth twice a day. You know, I went to a farm with Rachel and Chen. I rode a horse there and climbed a tree in the woods. Who's Rachel? Hey, Gina. Mom's a bit sick. That's why. She can't remember because she's a bit sick. I'm quite like that too. So let's talk again later. Okay. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. What is it, show me. No, it's mine. What is it? Show me! If I don't recognize Gina anymore, send me to a nursing home. Okay. Even until my death, she shouldn't know. Okay. Never! Never! You have to keep it a secret from her! I already gave you my word. I won't tell her. It's a secret. She can't find out. Dad, that's what scares me the most. What if I don't recognize Gina? I'm the only person who won't know when Gina's sick and scared. That's what scares me, Dad! I'll keep it secret. I give you my word. I'd rather die before that happens. How can I not recognize Gina? You should just kill me. Gina's going to be so scared if I don't recognize her. I forced her to go to the States. I did. It was my greed. I should have stayed with her... It's not greedy to want to raise your kid the best you can. No, I'm scared that I won't be able to raise her well. I'm so scared that I won't be able to raise her properly. Gina's grown up well. Don't worry. She can even grow up on her own. She's your daughter! With four different colored clays, we'll create new colors, and fill the picture in front of you. Okay. Mom, look. It's green, right? Green. You haven't done this before? I did, with my daughter. Sir, wait a minute. If you mix all at once, it doesn't come out well. Tear them into pieces and knead them. Do you see everyone as a patient? My dad's very sane. I'm the sick one. Can't you tell? Don't mind me. Do whatever you want. She's treating you like a patient! No, she's just helping out. Should we take a break? Yes, let's take 10 minutes. 10 minute break, everyone. Doctor Choi? Yes, sir? Thank you. She's going to be even worse at controlling her mood swings. You know presenile dementia develops fast. I heard. You have a kid? Wow. I thought you would be single for sure. I heard you were a lawyer. A beauty with an intellect. - That's hot. - Shut up. Piss off and worry about how to take better care of your mother. Ouch, that was hot. I love you. I love you. Did you get her a long-term care rating? Have you found a nursing home? It's not easy. Our nursing house won't have a vacancy at the moment either. Do you still want to have a look? It's quite different from other nursing houses. It's in the woods, so it's not suffocating. Many find it quite comforting. Softly, softly. Oh gosh, here please! - Dad, you can't pee here! - That's okay. - Here, use this. - Thank you. - It's okay. - Sir, please stand up. Everything will be okay. He recognized me even a month ago. He doesn't remember anything now. I know. Mom, you know who I am? Of course, Jun-il. That's right. Very good, mom. If you can't remember a thing, how's that human? Pardon? How can you be human if you don't remember anything? It's a zombie. Not a human! Soulless bodies moving around. Is that human? That's a zombie. Not a human! Hey guys, she's also a patient. She's ill. You guys all know how she is? You understand her, right? I think you guys better go home early today. Okay. Su-jin... Su-jin... I'm sorry. I'm glad you're alive. I'm glad I still have a daughter. Wasn't it hard for you to get here? What was her grade? They said grade three... For a long-term care certificate, get a high grade as possible. It changes the funding amount. Oh, that's okay. People like it here because the environment is nice. Mom, Su-jin's here. Please write your name on the wait-list. When your turn comes, we'll call you. How long do we have to wait? About 6 months to a year? Sometimes multiple vacancies open up at once. You took a look around, right? What did you think? I like it. Did I come here often? Yes, many times. The man who wears his left socks first, did he live a successful life? Yes, he did. We can, too. I'm scared. It's okay. I'm right here. Wear my left sock first, brush teeth at 11, work out at the same time every day. Then, do I get to feel alive? Yes. Let's do it together. Dementia, it can be fixed. Menu/Schedule Recycle Menu/Schedule Oh gosh, look. Look at this. It's all rotten, nothing good. Why? Something's gone bad? See? I told you to give me spare keys. Until when do I have to look after this poor widower? Am I the only person who can look after you? Who are you? Have you forgotten your auntie, Mi-ja? Ms. Kim, how can you always bail on me like this? You always give excuses, and feed ramyun to my kid. Ramyun's what your father has. Honey, come over here for a minute. - Get over here! - What's going on? Dad, whose is this? It's pretty. ♪ O, Cassiopeia ♪ ♪ The brightest among the stars ♪ You remember all the songs that I taught you? Of course. Mom, have you found my gift? What gift? I marked it, so look for it. By the way... You're really pretty. What's your name? What is it? What? Nothing. She often forgets meeting schedules and loses her phone quite often. So I had to find it for her many times. Sometimes, she'd leave the office in her slippers. You gave legal advice to Northbeck, right? I'm not sure. Witness, do you remember all the details of the contract? Counselor Park was diagnosed with Alzheimer's on September 1st, 2021. But the contract was signed 4 years and 3 months prior, on June 1st, 2017. Her illness had nothing to do with the contract. The early stages of Alzheimer's are hard to recognize. It can take up to 4 to 5 years to diagnose. So, it's possible that she was ill even before 2017. The mistakes that she made in various court cases support this. Also, there's her longtime assistant Hwang's testimony. Losing her phone and forgetting to change out of her slippers are all signs of Alzheimer's. My argument is that... as a result of the Alzheimer's disease, the notice served is void and in this court the sales contract shall remain valid. The sales contract... Witness, are you alright? Sir, I'll go. We need to cover her up. I'll take care of her. I'll help her change. - Stay calm. - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Sir, I'll bring her out soon. Where's my dad? Dad! Did you find something? Hello, sir. This is the person I told you about. Please come in. She's the most responsible caregiver I know. She's usually quite busy but she was able to find time today. The house is quite simple. You think? I think it's quite beautiful. Wow, nice interior design. Gosh, look at this. I knew this would happen. You should feed her well. Not only the fast food kind. You shouldn't think this will be easy because she looks normal on the outside. Even superheroes fall weak when they'll ill. No matter how smart you are. You know what it's like to take care of a patient all by yourself? She's kind of a perfectionist. She gets things done the right way. Poor thing. She has a kid. Where did you send the kid away? She's with her dad. Oh, she's with her dad? They're divorced, I see. How long have you been working as a caregiver? For five, six years. Go home. Sorry? I don't need a caregiver. This is not an easy job. Even if she looks fine now, in one or two days you won't be able to handle her. Oh, Lord. She's quite straightforward. - I'll look for someone else... - You don't have to. Okay. Su-jin, see you again. Su-jin, let's get dinner. Su-jin, what are you doing? Come over here, let's eat. Hey, Su-jin... Your clothes are wet. Let's get changed. No. You can't wear clothes soaked in urine. - You should change. - No, no! I'm your dad! Don't you know me? Why are you hitting me? I'm changing you because you're wet! Get off me, you pervert! Don't touch me, you pervert! Get out! If you behave this way, you're going to get in trouble! I'm your dad... Su-jin! Behave yourself! "Don't cry alone." Don't cry. Don't cry by yourself. Grandpa, I love you. Mom, don't cry. Mom, don't cry. Mom, I love you. Let's make up every day. "Mom, don't cry. Mom, I love you." I think some kid fought with her mom. Yes. Follow the dotted line to draw the shape Her orientation ability is almost completely gone. Orientation ability? It's the ability to understand the circumstances around her. Especially recognizing time, places and people. Why is her face bruised? Did someone hit her? Yes, I hurt her. Hello? How are you? Just as usual. We've got a vacancy at the nursing house. Really? Faster than I thought. My mother passed away. - I'll text you the info. - Okay. Miss, don't do that. Miss, Miss! Don't do that. Su-jin! Su-jin! Excuse me. Are you her guardian? Yes, I'm her guardian. I'm sorry. Come here, Su-jin. Did it hurt a lot when I hit you? I'm sorry I hurt you. You did good. When you dislike or feel scared, When you don't like something how do you feel? Scared or dislike. Try this. Repeat after me. No, I don't want to. No, I don't want to. No, I don't want to. Don't do it. Don't do it. Go away. Go away. It hurts. It hurts. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. My dad's sad. My dad's sad. My daughter's sad. My daughter's sad. Let's keep trying. Let's keep trying. Do you feel better? There's no man who's strong in front of dementia. I just pretended to do my best. But I'm broken inside and out. You have money. Don't put yourself through this. Do you think it's easy because I always put on a smile? Later on, you're not even sure who's the sick one. Send her to the nursing house, hire a caregiver, and go to support group meetings. I tried everything I could, and now I feel like my life has melted down. Su-jin! Spit it out. Spit it! Come on. There's nothing left in my life. Spit it out. No money. No job. No joy, no hope. You're still young. Spit it out. Because I'm young! That's why it's worse! Lawyer Park Su-jin has been eating paper for two days in a row. Doctor says she'll be showing repetitive actions like this more often. She may have an abnormal sexual drive and appetite. She may have impulses to hurt herself. I remember what my mother used to tell me. People are not born for nothing, grow for nothing, and die for nothing. Every moment, we owe each other and live by paying off our debts. So we shouldn't be upset. She said that too often. So I've never been bitter about anything in my life. Even now, someone may be paying off my debt. I as well may be paying off someone's debt. I've always thought so. I have dementia, so please help me out. Are you tired? I don't want us to make it hard for each other. You should get some time off. I'm okay. I can be with you all day. But you can't stay with me forever. Mom's clothes... The suit. I'd like to try it on. Should I bring it to you? Lawyer Park Su-jin's first day at the nursing house. You should always tidy up. It's being respectful to others and yourself. - Hello, Sir. - Hello. To have somewhere to go, and to have someone to meet each day is a grateful thing. Someone who knows me and pays attention to me, listens to my story and responds... It's a grateful thing. Wait, should clean up over here. You know it was strange. I knew I wanted to get another chicken. Just this once. Just a bit. Good, good. Now try it. Raise your fist twice, fingers twice, fingers twice, clap. - To your side, clap, clap, clap. - Like this... - Yes! - Very good. In-woo, you should rest here today. I'll go pick her up. You can't look after someone else all the time. No, it's okay. In-woo... Hey, I'll pack you some side dishes. It's fine. The suit... I'm sorry. I forgot to bring something. It's going to take a while. How long do you think? Couple of hours maybe. Wow, your dad's amazing. He has a timetable for you every 30 minutes. Why, what's wrong? I can't find my daughter. I thought she went to the States? She's in the States! Stop it! Get yourself together! Please find my kid! I can't find her! Goddammit, stop already! She's with her dad, okay? Dad? Whose dad? My dad?

When will I ever get to meet someone like you. I can take care of you, Su-jin. Su-jin, you need me too. We can get along really well. No. My dad won't like it. What? Don't touch me. My dad won't like it. My daughter won't like it. Your dad's not here. Your dad can't be with you forever. You only have me to protect you, got it? No. Go away. Don't touch me. My dad won't like it.

You need to come over here, now. Yes. Hello? You're Mr. Park In-woo's guardian, right? He's been moved to the recovery room. The surgery went well. What time can you get here? We've called you several times. Can you come to see him today? - Why are you so late? - I got here early. - Get in. - I wasn't late. - Let's hurry. - Get in. Hurry up. - Thank you. - Let's get out. Everyone, make sure you're not leaving anything behind. I heard it's raining tomorrow. Is the hike still on? It'll stop in the afternoon, so we can stick to the plan. Aren't you getting off? You're not part of our club, are you? Park Su-jin? Why would a big lady like you have a name tag on you? - This way, to the Mita temple. - Okay. Where are you going? Where are you going, mommy? My mom is crying. My mom said she cries when it rains. My mom never showed anyone her tears. My mom cries more when it rains more. Because she doesn't cry often. When she gets the chance, she will cry a lot. Mom, I wish you'd cry in front of me, because I can cover you. You'd feel stronger after you cry a lot. If you're tired, cry and sing. I will be by your side. Sing a song. Sing a song and come find me, mom. It's raining too hard! We can't go hiking! Are you sure the rain will stop this afternoon? It will stop soon, so hurry up. - Let's go! - Hurry up! - It's pouring. - It'll stop, so get in. Ms. Park Su-jin's here again. You're getting drenched. Get in the car, quick! Did you get up at 7? Yes. You changed diapers? Yes. Did you empty the recycling bins? Yes. Did you say no to those who annoys you? Yes. Do you know who I am? Yes. You're really pretty. What's your name? My name's Gina. I'll tell you again tomorrow. I made a friend in the States. Her name's Rachel. She's been really nice to me from the first day. I'll tell you about Rachel again tomorrow. The world's not only filled with people who look down on me or bully me. It's okay if there are. I'm not weak. I'm like you, right? I'm also not going to cry in front of other people. But when you're tired, I hope you can cry in front of me. I don't mind watching you cry even if it's hard for me. Because I'm your daughter. Because I'm your daughter, it's okay if it hurts me. Mom, you're so pretty. CASSIOPEIA
