NETFLIX PRESENTS Just walk around as though the camera wasn't here. -I'm cold. I'm going in the car. -This again? Well, whatever, Carla. You're out of my movie. Sandra, how do you adjust the focus?

Yeah, yeah, a little-- Mild to moderate winds in the western region. Ah-ma! MONDAY, APRIL 12 CARLA, VOICE MESSAGE Mild to moderate winds in the western region. Mumm! Dad, I'm trying you again.

I need you to come here. Come to Córdoba, even if it's just for a day. We have to figure out the settlement of the house. Please, call me. Maxi. I think they're planning a surprise. A surprise? -I don't know. -What do you mean? I overheard Gustavo and Muldín, but they saw me and changed topic. Well, investigate, Maxi. No surprises, especially not before the premiere. Don't worry. Your car will be there in five. Okay. Morning, Osvaldito. It's a beautiful day, lazybones. Wake up. Osvaldo. Osvaldito. Where's my baby? Where's my baby? Come on. It's a big day for Dad. Dad's going to work. Where are you? Osvaldito. Osvaldo, don't scare me. Where are you? Osvaldito. Oh, son of a gun. You scared me. Where did you go? To pee? You're acting weird, Osvaldo. Don't freak me out when I'm on my way to work. What's wrong? Give your dad a kiss. I'm going to work. Give your dad a kiss! There. Was that so hard? Miguel Flores. -Hello. -My idol. I can't believe it. Hey, let me take a selfie. Okay, of course. -Yeah? -Of course. -This way. -There. -Take your glasses off. -Okay. Miguel, boss! See you. -There. -Thanks, man. We'll be watching tonight. -Thank you. -You legend! Miguelito, hi. I have 20 kilos of laundry to hang tonight on the terrace. Tell me it won't rain. Don't worry, Elvirita. Tonight will be clear. Around 20, 22 degrees. Well, I'll be watching. At 9:45. The commercials have been nonstop. I'm excited, Elvirita. It's Argentina's first weather show. It's huge. Yeah, and you look good, sweetie! -I don't know. The competition is tough. -You'll get good ratings. Come on. -Okay, Elvirita. -Okay, Miguelito. -Let's go! -That's right. Hi, Maxi. I'm out front, and the cab's not here. Any word on the surprise? Sorry to bother you. It's fine, Alfonso. Hi, Kiko! I love you, Miguel! -Have a good day. -Bye! -I have a question. -Sure. My wife decided to use a bug bomb in the living room and kitchen. She wants Kiko to sleep on the patio tonight. I'm a little scared. But Gamexane is a very strong poison. -It is. -If he gets sick, we couldn't take it. Kiko is the son we never had. Don't worry, Alfonso. Tonight we'll have clear skies. Temperatures between 20 and 22 degrees, max. I'm glad. Thank you so much. So, Kiko, you're sleeping outside. Sorry for the interruption. -No, please. -Have a good day. Of course. You too. See you. Tell your wife I say "Hi." Bye. Look who it is! -The TV weatherman. -Yes. You know who he is? No. No, kids today don't know anything. They spend all day on their phones, taking photos with their tongues out. -They're always horny. -Grandma! -What? -I'm sorry. She's too much. No, it's okay. Good luck tonight. -Thank you. -Give me a shout out. -Okay. -I'm Mabel. Mabel. Mabel. -Bye. -Miguel? Yes. Maxi. The car's been there for ten minutes. -They lied. It just got here. -Tonight, 9:45, right? -Yes. -Good luck! Thank you. Bye. MAKE YOUR CITY AN OASIS THIS SUMMER INFALLIBLE The Great Weather Show starts this Monday on Channel 10, in prime time. And here we have the host, Mr. Miguel Flores, the infallible. Well, God is the only one who's truly infallible. Although it's true that in 20 years, I've never been wrong. So that'd make you like the God of weather? You're the one who said it. THE GREAT WEATHER SHOW Is that you in the picture? -What picture? -There, for The Great Weather Show. Yes, that's me. -You're famous. -A bit. When is that photo from? What do you mean? It's from last month. Why? No, just… What's the show about? Uh… the weather. You ever watch the news on Channel 10? It used to be a segment that was part of the news. No, I stream shows on my computer. I don't watch TV, honestly. My parents sometimes watch TV at night. And my grandma. -My grandma does. -Really? -Yes. -Okay. -Can you turn the music down a bit? -Yes. It's loud. -Sorry. Is that okay? -Yes. Ah. So what do you do on the show? I predict the weather. And… I mean, does that pay well? Mm. Almost as well as driving a limo. -Okay, we'll trade. -Yeah. Okay. Do you have to take a class for that? I might be interested in… -A class? No, it's a degree. -Ah. Yeah, atmospheric sciences. It takes seven years. Oh, no way. I have an app for that. -It gives me a ten-day forecast. -How accurate is it? -It's accurate. -Okay. No way. Those apps take data from meteorology reports, they put it on a colored graph, and with a math equation, they calculate regional probabilities-- Put your signal on, jerk! Ridiculous. This country, God. -There's a game on Saturday. -Mm. It's going to rain. How do you know? Did you watch Miguel Flores? If you want to know, you have to watch Miguel Flores. Weatherpeople are frauds. They get their info from their phone. Yeah, but not Miguel. Miguel studied meteorology. He's never been wrong. Did he pay you to say that? No, but he's never wrong. He's remarkable. He's never wrong. -All you do is talk about him, dude. -So? This is what I think. You have a thing for the infallible one. What are you laughing at? This again? I'm fed up with you two. -Don't get mad. -I'm fed up. -Stop fucking around. -Wait. Jorge, give him a pastry so his blood sugar spikes. A dozen, so they'll leave me alone. Enough. Okay, thank you. Bye. Miguelito, tonight's the big night. A turning point, Domingo. Good luck! -Let's go, Miguelito. -Let's go. Extras to Studio 4, please. -Carmencita. -Miguelito. Nervous? -No, excited. -Let's go! Miguel, finally! Hi. Is this the suit? No. If you don't like it, I'll run into traffic. You tried it on Thursday. Who said I didn't like it? I'm just asking. -No, but it's nice. -Oh, okay. Now, the neon cloud on the door, did you do that? -If you say you don't like it, I'll die. -Stop. You can't kill yourself over everything, Maxi. God. "Miguel, keep up the good work," that's nice. Did you see all this? -Beautiful. -Beautiful. Did you get the report from the Weather Service? -You didn't get it? -No. I sent it to you. Check your phone. -Miguelito! -Hey. -The day has come. -Let's do this! -How are you? -Good. Energetic. Great, I can tell. Your aura is glowing. Your eyes are shining. You look great! -Beautiful. -Great! So, what do you think of Mery Oliva? -Who? -What do you mean, "who"? Mery Oliva, the weathergirl from Channel 23. -I don't know her. -Your secretary. She's your new on-air secretary. -That's the surprise. -Mm. Gustavo, I don't need a secretary. We all need a secretary. Come with me. -No, wait. Let me get ready. -Yeah. -Come with me. -I need to focus. Don't be shy. You'll love her. -Trust me. She brings in a younger crowd. -Why spring this on me at the last minute? She'll be at the side the whole show. She'll read funny tweets. -Gustavo. -Hi. You can't do this to me now. -My God, you're difficult. -I'm difficult? Yes. This could be good for ratings. Nothing makes you happy. How many Instagram followers do you have? How many do you have? -312,000. -Two million. -So? -She has two million. That's a lot. It doesn't matter if she has nine million. It matters a lot. -Today's the day, Miguel. -Hi. Hey, how are you? Okay, but you have to give me a heads-up. I'm the face of the show. -Yes, I know. -So? You have to trust me. I can't do it alone. -You have to trust. -No. Don't tell me I'm not trusting. We've been in pre-production for two months. When you wanted the salsa band, what did I say? I want a big band, like Glenn Miller. Glenn Miller, look… Don't make me dance. Look at them. God. -Hello. -You wanted the globe, there it is. -Guys, you're great. -Amazing. I told you she was a bombshell. What we did on Channel 23, remember? But… with more production. Gus wants the show to be an event. Oh, Gus. -Okay, you didn't mention that. -Okay. Mery, beautiful, let me introduce you to Miguel. Ah! Hi! Aw. -My mom loves you. -Wow. -We're done, right? -Yes. Her notes need to mention the weather. Yeah, Mery was telling me… I don't know what Channel 23 was like, but what you'll see here hasn't been seen in the history of Argentinian climate TV, so write it down. -Okay, I will. -Yes. -He didn't write it down. -He will. You told him twice. Mery's on Twitter and Instagram duty. And Facebook. Facebook doesn't matter much. For Miguel's fans, it does. Right. And is the dog working with us? No, I can't. -So cute. -Excuse me, Miguel. -Stand in front of the screen. -Okay. Okay. Here? -Look at this! -Perfect. There it is. Look at this! -Just like I dreamed. Look. -Beautiful. -Look what we did. -Yeah. -We set this up for you. -Yeah, you did. This is going to be a success. The people upstairs are excited. I'm excited, not to mention the sponsors. Excited, I'm sure. I am too. I love it, but don't forget the show is for entertainment. To get people out of their heads, as a distraction. No, the show is about the weather. It's not a distraction. Okay, tell me who else has a screen like that, a globe, a band, Mery reading tweets, a unique host, like yourself… Tell me. Because otherwise, we're giving the same information as every other weather show. No. My information is unique. I put in the work. That's why people believe me. Apps are wrong. I'm not. Do you know who you're producing? I know who I'm producing. You're number one. -So…? -I do all this to make you happy. -Are you happy? -No, you made me upset. Got anything not from Córdoba? Córdoba, Jujuy, same thing! -What do you mean? -Relax, he doesn't know jack. No, Córdoba's not… They're not the same! I was relaxed. I wanted to focus, warm up. You threw me off. You're killing me. -Can you calm down? -No, I can't. I want you to relax, don't get upset. The girl and the dog are on a trial period, okay? Light to moderate winds in the western region. -Great. Good luck, handsome. -Thanks, lovely. Where's the wolf? Careful, it's hot. -For fuck's sake. -What happened? -I burnt myself. -I said it's hot! -Now look. -Look at this blister. -We're ready. -They're ready. Great, "we're ready." Look at this. -Is it swollen? -Huh? No. God, Miguel. You look great. A cable car fell in Salta. The news is giving us great numbers! -No. -How are you? Good. -You're sure? -Yes. -Ready, Miguel? -Yes. Yes. Okay? Yes, I'm great. Let's shine. This is your day. -Give it your best. -Let's go. Rolling, standby. Action! From Buenos Aires, Argentina, comes the first national weather show. With you tonight, the amazing weatherman, the man who brings gods to their knees… Did Miguel write that? Yes, he was inspired by the introduction for Apollo in Rocky IV. Here is… -Miguel Flores! -Whoo! WITH MERY OLIVA Hey! Welcome to The Great Weather Show. The first weather show in Argentinian television. It's amazing. How did no one think to make a show about the weather? -I think… -What's wrong, Grandpa? -Get this moron off… -Dad will kill me if I change it. Many people ask me, "Miguel, why make a show about the weather if I can get that on my phone?" Here we're going to show them those apps have lied to us our whole lives. God damn it! Oh! Luis! What's wrong? What's next? Look at me! A religion where God is a 1,500 GB smartphone? Careful, okay? It might not be a bad idea to renew your faith just by recharging a battery. I adjusted it the other day. But you can't fix it by adjusting. You have to change the tap, the spout, everything. Marisa, worry about the chicken. I'll wash the tomatoes in the bathroom. That's your solution? I'm so fed up! How much is the liquid you use for the tires? Not much. Can you listen to me? I am, Marisa, relax a bit! It's Miguel Flores' first show. I'd like to at least listen to it. Is that too much to ask? Does it matter more than the kitchen sink? -Does what matter more? -The liquid, Luis. The liquid. Yes, it matters more. It's a tool for my work. Done. Done. How are the ratings? Great. Peaks of 17 points. Channel 12 is at 11. Yes, Miguel! Didn't I say he was a genius? Come on, Miguelito! I have great news for Buenos Aires citizens. Tonight and tomorrow night will be completely clear, high of 22 degrees. I, Miguel Flores, the infallible, guarantee it. This chicken is a rock. Twenty percent chance of storms at 2:00 a.m., it says. No, those apps are never right. Yesterday they said "rain all day." Not a drop. Not a drop. Your dad believes the TV comedian more than science. Comedian? Miguel Flores studied this for six years. He always says so. Goddamn chicken! Anyway, Luis, why don't you put the taxi in the garage, just in case? Tonight's clear. Didn't you hear? Is the volume off? Do what you want. Like always, you end up doing whatever you want. That's it. -What do you mean? -It's bullshit! Washing tomatoes in the bathroom. -She said, "bullshit." -Yeah. I spent nine hours today in that taxi. Nine hours. The first passenger took me downtown. The main avenue was closed for a protest. I had just a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch, while the lights were red. I made less than 1,500 pesos, and you want me to spend 700 on a parking spot, 15 blocks away. Why are you growling so much, Dad? You sound like a dog! Okay, this is over. Let's see what the dog eats now. -See, it's the other one. -Oh my God. You always have to be right. -And you don't? -No. -You love winning. -No… And tonight you won. You won big, infallible one. Heart-stopping. Inflammable. -Should we go to the room? -I want to say hi to Osvaldo. -Osvaldito. Okay. -Just a second. -I'll be waiting in your room. -Coming, Osvaldo. Hey. Hey, Osvaldito. Osvaldo, where are you? Oh… I did well today, Osvaldito. I did well. 19.2 in ratings. I'm so happy. Kisses. Until tomorrow. Sleep tight. What's wrong, Luis? -No, stop. Stop. -Come here. No! No! No! What are you doing? Are you crazy? I told you to put the car away! Don't tell me, "I told you so." For fuck's sake! We're going to get killed. He promised! He said, "clear skies." He's an idiot! An idiot! Come inside, Luis! Come inside, damn it! Hi. Good morning. Oh. Oh. What time is it? 9:30. What time? 9:30. How? Didn't I tell you to wake me up at 8:30? I know, but you were sleeping so peacefully, I couldn't. -Your coffee. -Thanks. How are you? -Good. There you go. -Thanks. Did you water the plants? What? Did you water the plants by the window? No. I'm going to be so late. I slept horribly. I woke up from the storm and I couldn't go back to sleep. What storm? Around 3:00 a.m. It rained like crazy. Okay, will I see you tonight? Huh? Call me, and we'll do something tonight. Yeah. Bye. …testifying before the court. She's starting a legal battle against her father, Jamie Spears. But unfortunately, this is the big news of the moment. In five minutes, chaos unleashed. Torrential rains and heavy hail with up to 45 miles per hour winds caused vast destruction in greater and central Buenos Aires. It can't be. Could Buenos Aires become a tropical city, Antonio? It looks like it. Look at this footage filmed… MAXI, VOICE MESSAGE, 72 UNREAD MESSAGES, 47 MISSED CALLS Flores! Fuck you! Oh! Look, there he is! Cancel him, that moron. Take his picture. -No, no. Please. Stop. -There, take his picture. God, stop. Oh… PET CREMATION BELOVED PAW PRINTS Hey! Flores! Are you going to pay for this, moron? -No, sorry. -Son of a bitch. Oh, Miguelito, you really messed up. -Elvira. -What are you going to do? It's okay, Elvira. You put holes in my car, dumbass! Oh, my God. My car. Here it is. Go. -Stop. -Miguel, they'll hang you. My God. Murderer! Major social media backlash against Miguel Flores. Twitter has blown up. Some worthy mentions. Luis Craus says, "Instead of those media clowns, why don't they give camera time to real unsung heroes that work for the National Weather Service?" You have to ask, "Whose fault is it?" Someone from the National Weather Service, or us for believing it because it's on TV? I have to take a detour, the road's cut off ahead. The storm broke a traffic light. Viewers say, "Good-for-nothing rat, they destroyed a city for some ratings." Tito Delafe says, "I think they're using Flores as a scapegoat." The lines at the mechanics are five blocks long. They're going to make more cash than Cristiano Ronaldo. For me, he lost his charm. Love him, hate him. It was an incorrect forecast. No one died. Let's relax. Miguel Flores. Angel or demon? Are we facing a new societal divide? Will it be much longer? No, no, no. Here. It's an anti-stress ball. It works. If you want, squeeze it. Here it is. -Logan 2020… -2020, yes. - license plate BA477 - CB. Right. Your policy doesn't cover hail damage. It does. Look again. It's total coverage insurance. Yes, of course… "Total coverage" is just a title. What do you mean? Did you read the fine print? No, I didn't. I trusted you guys. I took out a total coverage policy, and I figured "total" meant everything. Of course. Yeah. "Total" means everything… except hail in this policy, but if you want, we can upgrade. I can tell you how much it is. Listen, kid. The car is my job. Of course. Of course. Of course. Here. No, take it. A souvenir from the company. Keep it. No. Take it. Morning, Domingo. Miguelito. -I brought you the payslips. -Great. -Sit down. -Okay. What do you think of Itaparica? -What? -Itaparica, Brazil. -I've never been. -It's great. Below Bahia. Average temperature of 30 degrees, speedos, caipiroska… The samba there is crazy. The whole happy Brazilian vibe kind of annoys me. Eh, but the network can get you half-price tickets. Are you going on vacation? No. You're going. You really fucked up, Miguel. Look, you know me well. Gustavo, you know who I am, how I work. I analyzed the reports down to the smallest detail. I don't know what happened. But you guaranteed it. "I guarantee it." Yes, that's true, but it's a catchphrase. -People love catchphrases. -No, people love being entertained. clearing their heads, forgetting their daily troubles. Remember, I told you? The show is for entertainment. It was simple, Miguel. Okay, I was wrong. I was going to be wrong at some point. Gustavo, come on. Have you never been wrong? How many bad shows have you put on TV that didn't work? You're the infallible one. Right? Rocky IV. Isn't that right? The infallible can't be wrong. Do you have any idea how much destruction this storm caused? Do you know how many viewers who follow you daily lost their roofs, houses, cars, windows, whatever else? Of course, but they'll understand. Climate change is what's changed things. People know-- No. People don't know shit. No, excuse me. People know. They know they'll have to spend money they don't have fixing something that, if you hadn't been wrong, they wouldn't have to fix. What are you saying? The storm is my fault? What is that? No. What are you saying? I'm going crazy. No, don't… Go to Itaparica. Don't go crazy. Take a vacation. Are you firing me? No. I just said I'm giving you an early vacation. Then we'll see. You know people forget everything. Soon, they'll have someone else to hate. Wait, Gustavo. You can't end the show. It's only had one episode. Of course. On that, we agree. The show will go on. No, the show will go on, but you won't. Ah… I can't believe this… How can one wrong prediction be the end of a long career? A wrong prediction? -Have you seen social media? -So? You know how people are. There's no accountability. Those people are our clients, they decide our future here. -They don't decide. You do. -Okay, okay, if you say so. They decide for me. We're a true democracy. They vote, I obey. Those are the rules. You should know that by now. -Oof. -Oh. I know what that "oof" means… I mean… of course. Right. You decide whether I stay or… Well, no. They decide for you. Sorry for asking, lately… it's hard to understand how things work. Yes, I'm going to the studio. But I don't have a helicopter, okay? Carmencita. Yes? Silence, we're recording. You knew, right? That's why you were acting weird. Hmm? You knew. You knew. Joining you tonight, our star host, Mery Oliva! This is unbelievable. It's… Babe, open your mouth. No, don't… What is that? A rescue remedy. It's good for you. There. A little lower. Whoo! Look at her, Susana. Good evening! Welcome to The Great Weather Show. Thanks for tuning in. Before we start, we want to send our love, me and Simón, to our friend Miguel Flores, who's currently dealing with health issues. We hope he recovers soon. Miguel, be strong. That kiss is for you. Good. This is good. What? I'm healthier than ever. Sons of bitches! Calm down. This isn't good for you. This isn't good for me! This is fake news. My God. What's going on? Seriously. What's happening? People used to say they loved me on the street. They know me. Yes. And now I'm guilty of everything. I'm a public schmuck. A fucking meme. No! When life gets tough, weather the storm! No… What do you want? -My phone! -Here it is. -No! No, that's it! -Calm down. No, no, no, I've had enough. I… no. Not anymore. Now they'll hear me. -Hello? -Hi. Put me through to Gustavo. -Who's this? -You know who this is. Don't play dumb. -Put-- -Gustavo's in the studio. He's not in the studio. He's next to you. Don't lie to me. He just left. I… Let me clarify, this show on the air is mine, and you know it. I created this show. Hello? -She hung up! Son of a bitch! Ah! -Relax. -Stop. -She hung up! -She hung up! -Miguel! Calm down, please! You're going to pass out. -What do you mean? Oh! -Ah. -What's that? -Hang on. -It's a stuffed animal. -What…? Who threw this shit? -What is that? -Calm down, Miguel. Don't touch it. It might be a bomb. No. Stop. It's ketchup, not blood. Ketchup? Who threw that? -Who was it? -Babe, wait. Who threw this? And why? Who is it? Huh? Careful. -Inside, Miguel. -Yeah. But why? But… -Uh… What was that? -Come on, Miguel. F YOU, FLORES RETIRE, DEAD MAN Fuck you, Flores. CANCELED Flores, you asshole! Come out, Miguel! Fuck you! Fuck you! -Come down here, Flores! -Fuck you, Flores… -I'm here, Miguel. -Okay. -Are you ready? -Did you park in the garage? The woman wouldn't let me, I had to pay her. -Really? -You told her to hang her clothes. I can't believe that. What a bad woman. I gave her everything. Videos for her and her family. -Autographs… -Enough! Enough! You know what people are like. -We're going to be late. -Yes. How can I help? -No, that's it. Worry about the fish. -Huh? Put him in a bag with water. Osvaldo's going, too? What did you say? Osvaldo? What…? Where I go, Osvaldo goes. -Okay. -But… Fuck you, Flores! Fuck you, Flores! Fuck you, Flores! We made it, Miguel! We made it. Are you okay, Miguel? Listen to yourself, Maxi. We're almost there. Slow, moron! Sorry. We're almost there, love. You're white as a sheet. Why wouldn't I be? I couldn't breathe. Take Osvaldito, please. -Take Osvaldo. -Okay, okay. -How's everything here? -Good. -Eh? -Good. Okay, listen. -Pay attention. -Okay. Call Gerónimo Martens. Tell him to check me in quick, VIP. Okay? -Yes. Did you tell Martens? -I called him. I called him, and he didn't answer. He must be busy. -Okay, hurry. Let's go. -Okay. -Come on. -Yeah, it's him. Morning. Jorge, coffee, please. With a lid. To go. -Okay. -And three pastries, your pick. Jorge sells ice cream, Luis. You should order some ice balls. Don't get mad, dude. It's a joke. What's wrong? Did the infallible one fail? You know why that happened? You have to check your phone. -Aldo, why didn't you check? -What? Your phone. Don't you see your car's fucked up? My car's fine. Fine? Now it's fine! Now it's fine! What are you doing? Motherfucker! -I'll kill you! -Get away! -Why am I in line? -Because Martens isn't here. -Why not? -He just isn't. How about this? Get on the line for crew members and diplomats, it'll be fine. -Why? -Because you're Miguel Flores. -Stop. -Okay. -Call me when you get to Córdoba. -Okay. -Take care, I'll miss you. -Okay, okay. Enough, Maxi. How are you? -Go ahead. -Thanks. Scarf, glasses, hat, and watch, please. I don't have any metal. -The watch is metal. -You're right. Everything. I have pharyngitis. Go, Flores. Thanks.

Are you free? -Flores, how are you? Get in. -Okay. You're back, dude. You screwed over Buenos Aires. Dad? -What are you doing here? -You asked me to come. I did? To settle the house, Carla. But you never answered my messages. Here I am. I heard what happened, Dad. It's everywhere. Yeah, it's crazy. I don't want to be naive. Did you come here to hide? No, how could you say that? No! What is that? Osvaldito. I never told you about him? Osval… you never told me, no. I'm in a rush. I have to go to the hospital. Get a hotel, and I'll call you. -Wait… -Ah, the X-ray!

Don't you need more light? A little further back. Andy, it's today's big news. -It's trending, María. -Totally. Mery Oliva and production keep saying Miguel's sick. I don't want to be mean. I like Miguel, really, I followed his predictions daily. -"Followed"? Past tense? -Yes. Want to see my car? I have to say, Miguel fled like a rat from the storm, this photo sent in from a listener at the airport confirms it. -What's in his hand? -A fish, María. The only friend he has left, a fish. Son of a bitch. Bueno, eh… Dad. Yes? What is this? I bought a fish tank. It was 30% off. Come on, say hi to your sister. No, all of this. Did you clean? Oh, yeah. It was a little messy. -Yes. -Okay. Messy? -This is my mess, and I understand it. -Okay. Where's the Physiology VI book that was in that corner? -The red book is here. -No, no, not there. -Don't move my things. -Okay. -Please. -Sure, sure. No problem. I… where are you going? To buy some food. Excuse me, I'm famished. You don't need to. Dad made your favorite. Noodles and pink sauce with cut-up hot dogs. A wiener Bolognese. Wash your hands, come on. Getting a show in prime time is a goal… you're bored. Oh, no. That was a big yawn. No, I'm tired, Dad. I've been up since 6:00 a.m. Of course, right. What was I going to say? -About prime time… -No. Ah, the notary. Um, I'll call him tomorrow and set up an appointment ASAP, so we can get the settlement out of the way. -Perfect. -Okay. What do you want to do with the house? Sell it. Ah. And go where? I don't know. -Eh… -Mm… There's so much history in this house. It was your grandpa Domingo's. Do you remember him? He loved you so much. Ooh. He always said, "Don't touch Carla." He loved you. And this is the only… thing he left your mom. The only thing. What? Are you trying to guilt me about the family inheritance? No, what are you saying? It seemed like it. No, not at all. But I can't lie. I thought you'd stay here. -Yeah, and have a family. -Ah. No. -I'm not interested in that. -No? No. -Leave it, I'll wash it. -No, I will. How's Mauro? Are you still seeing him? Marcelo? Marcelo. It must be Marcelo, I don't know any Mauros. -Why did I say Mauro? -I don't know. I don't know any Mauros either. Are you still dating? No. Oh… Why not? I got bored. That's a shame. I liked him. You didn't like Marcelo, Dad. Please. You only met him once. You spent the whole meal… remember? You spent the whole time talking about you and your weather success. You don't know him. Okay. Are you dating anyone now? No. Mm. You decided to focus on your career. Yes. Like you. You go through phases. -It's not a phase. -You'll see. Eventually, you'll want a child. No! I'm not going to want kids. I'm not interested. You say that now. Wait five years. I'll feel the same. I'm not interested, Dad. You're a pediatrician. And? -And your job is to heal kids. -Other people's kids. Kids that already exist. They're already here. I didn't birth them. Someone has to heal them. You wanted to do the dishes? Do them. I need to lie down. Dad. Doesn't this seem… strange to you? Weird? -What? -This. You and me. I feel like when I talk to you, I don't know you. I feel like I'm talking to an acquaintance I see once in a while. But I don't feel like I'm talking to my dad. I don't. Thanks for dinner, anyway. How are you? Are you the concierge? No, I was walking by, I saw all this dog shit and I thought I should clean up. Miguel Flores lives here, right? -Are you another friend? -Yes. What'd he break? Huh? -My car. -Ooh. Is he here? Or is he gone? Uh, on TV they say he went to Córdoba. Is it true? Yes. He has a daughter there named Carla. Do you know where she lives? I don't know, dude. She's a pediatrician. She works at a public hospital. That was two years ago. I don't know if that's changed. Carla? Yes, Carla. Dude, move. You're holding me up. I have to finish cleaning. Go on, dude. Come on, go. Go! Good morning. Good morning, doctor. How'd the champ sleep? Good, he slept well. -He's a little sore. -Yeah? -From the operation. -Yes. It's all so recent. Here, sit up a bit. Tomorrow we'll have the lab results, and we'll see how to proceed. The important thing is that this guy is comfortable. And you haven't heard back yet? We have to wait for tomorrow. What's clear is that he's not happy with production and it seems he's leaving. We'll see. -Miguel Flores? -Yes, he's here in Córdoba. -Mom, Miguel. -Back to his roots. Or is he in hiding? Why? People who have seen him here in Córdoba say he's in perfect health. This whole "sick leave" thing seems like an excuse. -Did they fire Miguel? -Seems like it. -He's a fan of Miguel Flores. -Really? He wants to be a meteorologist. -Maxi. -How are you? At my best. What's up? I had to pick up the drops from the pharmacy. I'll go today and send them to Córdoba. Move a little. You have no waist. You're fat. Swim. -What? -No, I'm talking to Osvaldito. So? What should I do with your stuff from your dressing room? What do you mean? Why? Should I take them? Bring them to your house? -You're at the studio? -Yes. They asked you to clean out my dressing room? They suggested. Sons of bitches. I had that room for years. My second home, I can't believe it. I'll… Sorry, Maxi. I have to go, my daughter's calling. No, wait. Send me the address and I'll send you the drops. Okay, I will. Carla. Hey, can you come to the hospital? What? I have a patient who's a fan of yours and wants to meet you. Okay, sure. I'll be there soon. Thanks. Bye, see you soon. -He wants to say hi, take a photo… -How old is the kid? -Eight. -Eight. -Hi. -Hi, how are you? Couldn't you disguise yourself a little? A hat, glasses, something. -I don't know. What's wrong with the kid? -Doesn't matter. -Don't ask… -You legend! Don't ask him what's wrong. Say hi, take a photo, that's it. -But I want to know what… -It doesn't matter. Don't talk too much, Dad. Don't do that exaggerated optimist act. Hey, hey, hey. Okay. -Wait, what's his name? -Rodrigo. Hey, Rodrigo! Mom, Miguel! -It can't be. -Hi, ma'am. Nice to meet you. How are you, Rodrigo? My daughter said you watch me every night on TV -and you're a fan. -Daughter? He's your dad. Eh? You weren't on last night. Were you fired? No, I took a few days to rest, that's all. And to visit your daughter. -Yes. -Would you take a photo with Rodrigo? Of course, no problem. A little birdie told me someone here knows a lot about meteorology. Rodrigo, what's the weather going to be like tomorrow? Between 15 and 17 degrees, 75% humidity with a risk of scattered showers. Hired! See you on air tomorrow. Here we go. Smile. -Let's go. -Let's go. It'll be fine. -What? -The boy. You'll see. Don't make predictions, Dad. You don't know. No one knows. I can't stand people who say everything will be fine. They don't know! It's wishful thinking. It's a saying. It's an irresponsible, stupid thing to say. Everything goes wrong, then what? Someone has to clean up the mess. Okay. -I'm trying to be nice. -You're not. I don't know what you think nice is, but that's not it. It's not. I'm staying for a bit longer, Carla. -What? -Yes, I've decided. -And your job in Buenos Aires? -No, that's… I know nobody wants to see you now, but that will pass. They need someone to tell the weather in Córdoba, too. We already have weatherpeople in Córdoba. No one as good as me. I'm sure. You made the whole capital of the country hate you, Dad. -Don't make it nationwide. -Carla! Okay. Sorry, I know that was mean. -Too mean for my taste. -Sorry. -Ooh. -Too mean. -And I… -Listen. I need you to leave the house for a bit. What do you mean, "a bit"? I need you to be gone between seven and eleven. -Carla! -Sorry, I forgot. I forgot I have friends coming over. Where do I go for four hours? I don't know, Dad. Go for a walk. -Get something to eat. It's a great city. -So what? I can't be out in public with the way things are. -Everyone looking at me… -I don't know, Dad. I made plans before you came. Okay? -Yeah. Okay. -I need my space, Dad. Oh, Carla. "I need my space." Okay, let's talk. Carla. Carla. Carla! Carla! Carla! You locked me in. Did you realize? But… Unbelievable. I don't even exist to you. I don't, no matter what. Damn it. Now what do I do? Sorry, I don't want to bother you. People don't understand, right? I mean, it's… What they're doing is unfair. Another one, please. No one could've predicted… the hail. But I could've predicted the storm. I didn't see it coming. Did I say something funny? No. That's Bernardo. Who's Bernardo? Bernardo, meet Miguel Flores. The most famous meteorologist in the country. All right. Bernardo knows a lot about weather. He doesn't speak much, but when he talks, he's always right. Are you a meteorologist too? -The check, please. -No. Tell me tomorrow's forecast and we're good. I don't have it. I'm on vacation. It's on me, anyway. It's an honor to have you here. Tomorrow, 7:14. Rain. What? At 7:14 in the morning, it's going to rain. Exactly? 7:14. Okay. Thanks for the whiskey. -The spinach and cheese quiche is good. -So yummy. -Hi. -Hi. -Hey, a guy's here. Your dad? -No. Dad, you came back early. Early? You said 11:00. It's 11:45. -Already? -Yes, already. Hi, Miguel. Hi, Mauro. How are you? -It's Marcelo. -Sorry, I keep confusing those names. It's fine. -All's well? -Yes. Good. Good. Sorry to meet you like this. If I had a heads up, I'd be dressed. No, no problem. Well, I'm heading to bed. We have two surgeries tomorrow, I need the rest. Of course, you have to rest. Miguel, let me say that your fish looks delicious. Well, thanks, but he's still alive. Of course, right. But he eats a lot. He loved the quiche. What? Osvaldo can't eat that. -What do you mean? He loved it. -What… I… There's a guy in the bathroom. -How many are there? -Go to your room. -They're leaving. -But… But the guy came out… Coming through. They're gone, Dad. In case you need to use the bathroom or the kitchen. Didn't you say you stopped seeing Marcelo? -Yes. -So why was he walking naked here? He wasn't naked, and we're friends. Oh, friends. And the other two, were they friends? Yes, they are. We're all friends who sometimes like to… be together. Okay. Well, you don't owe me an explanation. It seems like I do. It's just strange to me that you like to be with your friends. Okay. So, tell me, Dad, what did you expect me to like? I don't know… You know nothing about me. -That's not true. -It is. You know nothing about me and I don't know anything about you. I mean. Tell me, who are you dating right now? What kind of question is that? I don't know who you've dated since Mom died. No one important. Mm-hmm. So, friends. Friends with benefits. You could say that. Well, I also have friends with benefits. Look, if you're thinking of staying in Córdoba for a while, I think you should look for a place. -Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm. Great. Seriously. I did what I could, Carla. You lost your mom. I lost my wife. I know we've been apart for a long time… Stop. Your job in Buenos Aires, right? Work is far away. "It's not that I don't want to see you, blah, blah, blah." "I have so much work, I don't have time, blah, blah, blah…" Ah. "Life is tough there." You don't need to justify it, Dad. Really. I'm not complaining. That's not true. The things you say and your distance say otherwise. Distance? We've been apart for a long time, I didn't decide that. It's the only way I've found. Putting distance between us? To deal with the death of your mother. Not a day goes by that I don't think about that lightning bolt and how random her death was. I had to make sense of it. I couldn't accept that she just died like that. -It's Mom's fault, then. -No. It's my fault. Since that storm, I couldn't stop asking myself why. Why didn't I see it? Why didn't I see it coming? I threw myself into data, numbers, maps, forecast accuracy, and slowly I became… obsessed. Yes. That obsession brought you success, and that success… brought you to Buenos Aires. Until I failed again. Right, then you remembered you have a daughter in Córdoba. No, it's not like that. It's not like that, you weren't a little girl. You weren't alone. You had Grandma. I told you many times, "Come live here." "No, I'll stay with Grandma." You were always independent. You never wanted my opinion. Ever. And you still don't, do you? So. Time flew by, and I didn't realize the distance between us grew. Or I chose not to realize. I don't know. Hmm. Uh, is this an apology? Maybe, I don't know. -Do you think I did it on purpose? -I don't know. You're my daughter, the most important thing in my life. Maybe I'm not the dad you dreamed of. But… Dad, I needed you. I needed you so many times. Until a day came that I didn't. I didn't need you anymore. Well, I need you now. Hmm? Okay. Okay. Okay. How about this? I don't know, let's start… by being the father and daughter that we can be. Okay, that works. -Whatever you say. -Okay. -Let's not force it. -Okay. Okay? Please. No, we'll do what we can. -Good. -Eh? Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Sleep tight. You too. How are you, Osvaldito? Things are hard. Yeah. Your sister is like you. It's hard for her. Okay then. Get some rest. It's night-night time. See you tomorrow. Morning. Morning. I made coffee and toast. Ah. No, thanks. I'm late. Okay. What's this? Some homeopathic drops my assistant sent me. Homeo… Your daughter is a doctor, and you're taking sugar pills. For anxiety. But I also take regular pills for triglycerides. -They were high. -Mmm. -I leveled them out. -Listen, Dad. Um… Hmm? Tonight I'm having dinner at the hospital. Once a week I have dinner there with the kids and their parents. Okay, I'll stay here. No, no. Do you want to come? Yeah, of course. Of course, I'd love to. Or if you had other plans… Plans? No, nothing. Okay. Tell me when. I'd love to. Yeah. You know what? I'll have some coffee. -Of course. -Yeah. Start your morning… Yeah. If I'm a little late, it's fine. Yeah, who cares? They won't say anything. Nothing. Son of a bitch. Excuse me? Hi. Can I ask you something? Flores, it's you! Hi. My mom won't believe this. -She loves you. -Not now, please. Excuse me! We're closed. We open at 12:00. Just one thing. There was a guy here last night with a poncho. -I need… -Look. -One second. -I'm busy, please. -What, are you too important? -Not at all. Buenos Aires kicked you out, Flores. My God. Thank you. Hurry, I have to finish up. There was a man sitting at that table. He had a poncho, he was drinking grappa, he looked very rustic. Bernardo? Maybe. Do you know where he lives? Yeah, he lives that way, by the mountains. Where exactly by the mountains, what area? Ah. It's not easy to get there. Don't worry, just tell me where. Wait just a moment, and we'll head back. Hmm? Oh, sorry. Good morning. I clapped because I didn't see a doorbell. There's no bell. Ah. There's no electricity here. Ah. But you could've knocked like this. -Easy. -Yeah, that's true. What are you here for? An answer, that's it. How did you know it would rain at 7:14 on the dot? Should I wait? Are you coming back or should I go? -Come in, damn it. -Ay. Yes, sir. Coming in. Come in. What a nice house. -Here? -Yes. I'll take a seat here. Thank you. My mother ate boiled corn on the cob every day. She looked at the bubbles in the water and knew if it would rain. Oh. Wow. Did you inherit your mom's gift? You can see it from the bubbles? I don't like corn on the cob. So how do you know when it's going to rain? I'd love you to teach me. Look, I can pay you. I can get you electricity and a satellite to watch TV. I don't need anything. Well, but… How do you live without electricity? Do you have a flashlight? Candles? No, nothing. You can't live in the dark. I sleep at night and have the sun during the day. Right. No, I was fantasizing, thinking, "Hey, maybe we could unite our talents." Eh? What I'm going to say sounds crazy. I thought we could have a show here. You'd do the forecast, I'd host. You must be from Buenos Aires, always wanting more. I'm not. I'm from Río Cuarto. My dad delivered seltzer, my mom was a seamstress. I busted my ass to get where I am. And where are you? Why do you do this? Are you interested in weather? Or do you like fame? It's much more complicated than that. When I was young, my dad had ten vacation days. And every summer he brought us to Mar de las Pampas when it was practically uninhabited. And there were summers where we had ten days of rain. And I saw how it upset my dad to the point of depression, and it ruined our vacation. So, as a child, I always dreamed of controlling the weather. To see my dad happy, just for a bit. Nobody can control the weather. Nobody. I know. But forecasting is the closest you can get, right? Should I wait? Are you coming back, Bernardo? Come, damn it. You're never there when I need you. No more. I bought everything. I only asked you to go to Once and look for a 90 candle for Dad's birthday and you say no. -Can I talk? -Fine, talk. I have to do something, Marisa. How mysterious. Like what? Something. I can't say. I just have something I need to do. Ah. Okay. Ugh! -When will you be back? -Not today or tomorrow. Maybe the day after. What? You're just coming back whenever? Are you seeing a hooker? You are. What? A hooker? Marisa. Why do you overthink things? What money do I have for a hooker? Okay… Sorry. Let's calm down. I'll be home in a couple days… -In a couple days… -I'll explain everything later. Why the fuck did I go to yoga today? Marisa, don't! Stupid. Argentina. Where we're standing is Argentina. No, man, the dirt is Argentina. The weeds are Chile. The weeds there are Paraguay. Those weeds are Uruguay. Uh-huh. So it's like a map? Yes, a map. The rock is La Pampa, the anthill is Salta, this rock is Neuquén, Back there is Santa Cruz. Ah. Do you want to go to Buenos Aires? Yeah, sure. Come. Buenos Aires. What's that? Professor Neurus. Look at his hair. What color was Professor Neurus' hair? Purple? No. Grey. Was this one a knockoff? No. When I was a kid I ate chocolate bars that came with toys. One day, the figurines started changing colors. They lose their color. Cheap paint. No. They speak to me. You know how? By changing their hair color. And what do they say? Hail the size of a soccer balls is coming. Not here. Where are we standing. In Buenos Aires. Yes, Buenos Aires. Uh… A huge storm. But… But today? Mm-hmm. Tonight. At 11:07. Bernardo, are you sure? Why the hell did you come if you doubt me? Sorry. Go warn the people. Nobody will believe me in Buenos Aires. Do you know how few followers I have left? If you really care about the weather and not fame, like you said, go to Buenos Aires and do what you have to do. Do it. For the people, not for you. For the people. Huh. Don't tell anyone I told you. I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want shit. Go and warn them, man. CÓRDOBA CITY HOSPITAL Bye. Dad. I'm in here. What are you doing? I have to go to the capital now. Take care of Osvaldo. What happened? A terrible storm is coming in Buenos Aires, I have to warn them. -Warn who? -What do you mean? Everyone. Place a phone call. I tried three times. No answer. Do you think they'll listen to you? I have a better chance, yes. -Are you drinking? -What? No, just a mate with grappa. -When's the storm coming? -Tonight, 11:07. 11:07? -On the dot. -On the dot. -11:07 exactly. -How do you know? A hermit told me. A guy who lives in the mountains, in the middle of nowhere. A strange man. He gets information from figurines. -Dad, how much did you drink? -Nothing, please. -Let's look. -What? Let's look. -Look. -What? Tonight, clear skies. They don't know, for the love of God. You'll be wrong again. Not this time. Last night he told me, "Tomorrow at 7:14 a.m. it's going to rain." I said, "No, no way." I was right here, and at 7:14 on the dot, it rained. I said, "Oh, my God." -The hermit said it? -Yes, exactly. So you're leaving. You're not coming to the hospital dinner. I have no choice. I'm sorry. Rodrigo's lab results came back good. Yes! I told you. I told you. Thank God. I'm glad he's okay. Okay. Wait a minute. -Dad, calm down. -What? Stop for a minute. Yes, What is it? What are you doing? Why are you going there, seriously? I said… No. Are you trying to rehab your image? Do you realize that these people who watch you every day don't care about you? You can't care about someone you don't know. They've shown you that. But maybe this time I'm not going so they'll like me. Isn't there another possibility, Carla? I'm going. I have to go. I'll call you when I land. Bye, Osvaldito. Be back in a few days. He's upset. He's upset. Hi. The infallible. Oh. Poor guy. Is this a neighbor of yours? -No. -Hey, relax, man. I watched you every night. Great, -You understand me, right? -Sure. -What are you doing? -Uh… Hey, stop. I have to kill you. -What is this? -Who are you? -You idiot! Idiot! -Stop, please! Put that down, whoever you are. -Luis Contreras. -Okay, calm down. You don't even know my name. I've watched you every night since day one. I'd rush home to see you on the news. -Calm down. -Get out. Not until I get what I'm owed. I don't owe you anything. What are you saying? -Come here. -Stop, man. -What's wrong with you? -I want you to see this. -What? -Look! Yes, your car is fucked up. It's okay. No, it's not fucked up. You fucked it up with your fucking hail. Stop, it's not my hail, it wasn't my fault. You guaranteed it. -Oh, my God, that phrase. -You guaranteed it, and I believed you. In 20 years, you were never wrong. Why were you wrong now? Did you want to wreck my car? Is that it? Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? Please, Luis. I was wrong, and I'm paying for it. Look where I am. -I'm hiding so they don't lynch me. -Dad! Okay, sorry. Look where I am. Look where I am! I drove 500 miles to kick your ass! -Calm down. -I can't go home, I can't go back to work without being called an idiot. "Listen to Miguel," I spent years telling them. Do you know how much they made fun of me? "Stop talking about fucking Flores." And I defended you… like a brother. I believed in you. I had blind faith. Your word was gold to me. Well, you were wrong. No, he believed me. I understand. I was wrong. I also blindly trust myself, Luis. But I have nothing to do with what happened. Calm down. Enough. -Put the extinguisher down. -Listen to me. Listen, I'll put this down. Just one second. Tonight there's going to be one of the worst storms in the history of Buenos Aires. Horrible. You still have time. Go home. Warn your friends and family so you can save them. Do you want me to look like an idiot? To get kicked out of my house? That won't happen. They'll respect you. Trust what I'm saying. I'm not wrong. 11:07. It's going to be a disaster. Go. I'm going home, too, to fix the damage I caused. -When? -Now. Look at my suitcase. I was headed to the airport, my flight leaves at 5:00 p.m. Go, you have time. 11:07. Go. 11:07. When you say "one of the worst storms," you mean…? More hail? Worse. Hail the size of soccer balls. Listen to me. Go. Here, let's do this. Let me get my wallet. I'm giving you my personal card. Eh? Here's my phone number. You can call me. If I'm wrong, we'll meet up, and you can crack my head open with that extinguisher. I'll allow it, seriously. Take the card. Now, go home. Eh? There it is. Go. Go. Ay. Go, kid. -Everything will be okay. -I loved you like crazy. Ah. I loved you like crazy. Go. I won't fail you. You'll see. Calm down. Go. Go, hurry. 11:07, okay, Luisito. Should I leave this open? Yes, please. Thank you. Bye, Luis. No. No! No! No, this guy is crazy. He came here from Buenos Aires. Poor guy. I failed him. -I'm going, Carla. -Okay. -I'll take you. -Okay. Take care of Osvaldo for me until I get back. Sorry for missing the dinner tonight. It's okay. Another time. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Welcome to Buenos Aires. Please stay seated with your seat belts on until the light is off. Thank you, Maxi, for bringing me here. Go home, close your windows, warn your family. Are you crazy? You think I'm leaving you now? I was with you when you were number one on TV and I'm with you when you're canceled, Miguel. You're very important to me. Calm down. Fine. I understand. Come with me. Let's go. Domingo. -Miguel, what are you doing here? -I'm here to see Gustavo. The… Open up, Domingo. Stop messing around. It's Miguel. Open! This moron thinks he owns the network. -Melisa, the lipstick isn't here. -We'll get them. Go get them. Get them, please. Carmencita this, Carmencita that. Okay. I told you seven times, this isn't my job. They're looking for wardrobe materials and they're in the hallway. I'm bringing them now. Incompetent people. Nobody does their job here. Oh! Relax. Relax. Miguel, breathe. Relax. -Follow me. Come on. -Yes. From Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, the show you've been waiting for. Humor, fun, joy, and a bit of weather. With you tonight, our star host. Yes! Mery, Mery, Mery, Mery Oliva! THE GREAT WEATHER SHOW HOST: MERY OLIVA Amazing! Goddess! Idol! Good evening! Welcome to The Great Weather Show. Hello, my band. Thank you. Thank you for tuning in, rain or shine. We sing regardless. It's always the guys, isn't it? Always the same thing. -Right? -Shh. Quiet. Do you want to know the weather? Yes! We have great news, Simón. Because tonight and tomorrow morning we'll have clear skies. With a high of 28! Yay! With just some mild winds… Lies! -Miguel… -Please… Can someone tell me what he's doing here? Buenos Aires and surrounding areas. Today, at 11:07 sharp we're getting the biggest hail storm you've ever seen. One of the wildest, most unpredictable storms. When meteorological radars detect it, it will be too late. And phone apps won't even know. Don't listen to them. -Cut to commercial. -Sixteen points and counting. -What do I do? -Touch that button, and I'll kill you. I know I was wrong last time, I know. But give me another chance. It's the only thing I can ask… I need backup in Studio 1. Do you copy? Believe me. -Domingo, please. -Believe me, please. Don't be an ass. It's Miguel. If you're at home watching, don't move. Warn your family. -Put on tense music, Conejo. -Post it. -Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. -Come on, Conejo! Use #Hail. Please. Worst-case scenario, everything's fine. You'll just have to stay inside for a bit, but I swear I'm not wrong. It will be a historic storm. -Twenty-one points. -Ha! Come on! Look ahead. 11:07, we don't have much time. Please. Please, for the love of God, believe me. Not a cloud in the sky. It's almost 11:00. -11:07. -So precise. 11:07. Look, two things can happen here. Either the world ends at 11:07 and you're back on Monday after I parade you around the city, or you're wrong again, and you go live in Stockholm. Gustavo, Mery's asking if she should wait. I'm coming. What's your wish, Grandpa? To die. Dad, don't talk like that. -I can't with this thing. -I'll just get a match. -Such trouble. -There, Virginia. Like that. Blow the candles out, Dad. He can't understand. There we go. Nice. Horacio. No. -Enjoy it, Dad. It's for you. -Want a selfie? Selfie. There. -Smile. -Hey! Hey! Hey! We all need to go inside. Are you kidding me, Luis? You vanish for two days, you don't help at all, now you're ruining my dad's birthday. Marisa, we'll talk after. A huge fucking storm is coming at 11:07. Let's go! A huge fucking storm! Who says?
