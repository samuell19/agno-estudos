Do you dream of the real life especially... Thirty-six! Did you fix that lock? Listen, Bra Joe, I promise. The moment I deliver the stove to that tavern, I'll attend to it same time. You better fix it. Fix this thing. Do you understand that? Fix it by Monday. Looks like I'm getting lost here, this place is confusing. It's not appearing on my GPS, Bra Joe. If you come across an old abandoned factory, then you have arrived. Do you know Sgodiphola, Bra Joe? My forest retirement home is near that place. And that will be the closest you will ever get to visiting me. So have you fixed that lock yet? Listen, Bra Joe, when I'm done here... First thing Monday morning! The first thing I want to see on my desk is that stove delivery docket. Understood? And a new lock on that door. If that's not done, I promise you, you will look like that Sgodiphola factory. Abandoned. You understand? Thirty-six? - Bra Joe. - I don't trust this kid. - Hi, how are you, man? - I'm fine. - Awesome. - I'm the guy with your stove. Hey, help him fetch the stove! Sir, it's gone. They took it. They took your stove. Hey, man. It wasn't my stove yet, it hadn't been delivered. You see my last stove, was stolen from there. You see all the RDP houses are experiencing the same issues with their stoves. And now you? These stove thieves are back for sure. I am a dead man. I saw them, they were driving a microbus. One of them acted like a goat. Tell me, was the microbus green? That's the one. It could be... maybe it's Puntsununu. You know, those guys are dangerous. Puntsununu? You see, You spend a lot of time that side, I need you here. Dad, how many beers must we sell for our lives to improve, since the factory closed down? 10,000? 20,000? 25,000 could make a difference. The world is bigger than your Boy's Holiday Tavern, Dad. Some people have money, they make it rain. You want to go? Then go. And make sure you take an umbrella, so that when it rains, you are covered. I hope it pours down hard on you! Goodness. My daughter. Mixes with thugs, roughnecks and gangsters. Please tell me, Sir, are those the same thugs that stole my stove? Did you see the guy that just left? That's Puntsununu's bodyguard. They're dangerous people, they are the ones who deal with gas here in Sgodiphola. They run this town. Man, take my advice. Best you take your own money, pay your company and walk away. I can't do that. Just tell me where to find this Puntsununu? Where your grave is. I will leave that grave and come back here with your stove. You don't want to listen. Turn there, go uphill then down. When you get to a street that curves left, that's the place. - Thank you very much. - Listen, you better pray hard. Hey you! Hey you, boy! Are you here to buy or fuck off? I've seen you before. Where's Puntsununu? Listen to this guy! He wants Puntsununu! Here's Puntsununu. Now piss off. I said piss off! How would you like a bullet sandwich? Hey man, do you even know how to use that? Okay, so you can make it fart. But can you hit a target? Where's Puntsununu? Why? Do you want to shoot him? I'm not here for that. I'm here about a delivery. Mafia, wash the car. No, Big Nunu, it's the delivery boy who did all this. I was watching, he kicked your ass. Smally, why haven't you finished the hole? Boss, the ground is too hard. Hey... dig harder. Okay, Boss. Bring him Workshop. Hey fool, you forgot this. Karate parcel boy. So, what have you brought me? I'm not here for that. I'm here to fetch what's mine. Someone here stole my load. Are you asking me or telling me? Every thing about Sgodiphola is telling me that. You know you're lucky. It was nice out there, playing cowboy and messing up my yard. And that coal trick of yours, would've been better if you had caught the bullet between your teeth. Where's my stove? I don't know. And frankly, I don't care. All I'm interested in, is a sharp shooter. And I saw that you can play a gun, like an amapiano beat. I make it sing like a bird. Look at me very carefully. I'm a professional with a guitar. In my time, I was a soldier. Soldier, I love your story, chap. Now tell me, the stove you're looking for, how much does it cost? -15,000 -Only? Then here's a tender. How would you like to make 20,000 rand by the end of this weekend? Talk. I'm listening. So now you want to hear my story, chap? OK, I'll tell you. One day, day... this town was built to serve one factory. Hold this Christmas Tree. Do you dream of the real life? A stress free-balanced life Then you need a dream home. For years the factory did well and, Sgodiphola was doing well. Top class, my hot stove. But one day they decided to close down the factory. So then our town became full of desperados and started to fall apart. So I volunteered myself, to fill the gap and start my own factory. And so I did. I have a simple plan, to make Sgodiphola great again. This is Workshop. He lost his job when the factory closed down. The boys you saw outside were unemployed youth. I became the government and gave them jobs. But the desperados got jealous. That's why I need a way to protect my workers. But now I've got you, my soldier. You'll teach me how to use my gun. My machine gun... So for 20,000, all I need is to teach you how to use a gun? And we all live happily ever after, my soldier. And sleep peacefully at night. Sleep peacefully at night? People will start shooting at night. And you're just making noise here. Mumsy I was just telling him about the dream. You see that dream of yours, just tone it down, or you'll realise that dream in an ambulance. No problem. I'll teach you. Just some petrol money as deposit and I'm yours till Monday. Welcome to Sgodiphola. What's up gents! Brother. - It's game time. - OK. We're working with a soldier now. Who's the soldier? Parcel Boy is our soldier. He's going to teach us how to shoot. Oh yeah, he kicked Mafia's ass. That's why I hired him. He shoots like a sniper, that's why. Smally, help him fetch his van, and keep an eye on him. You know these streets are full of desperados. Who's the goat now? Mafia is going to kill that stupid delivery boy. Not yet you idiot! We'll use that guy. But, Big Nunu. I don't understand this Puntsununu. What if this guy is a spy? We're taking him with us on "The Night of The Jackal". What? You see now, Big Nunu, Your hard drive is starting to crash. Relax, I've paid the guy, he won't go to the cops. Am I not right, Notch? Yes, it's time now! - It was clear when he got here that... - Notch, Notch, Notch. This isn't time for shit! Is it time for shit? Hey! You can't shoot for shit! Boss, you know I'm a good shooter. Shooting is my thing. That guy had a lucky shot. Let me show you. You want to kill the boss? Relax, ah, Mafia. Boss, are you alright? You see? We need that guy. And he's coming with us tonight on the "Night Of The Jackal". All you need to do is keep an eye on him. And then you... You my six plate stove... I want you to hit him with a little panty. Make him fall for you so that you can know his thoughts. No. I prefer charming you. Let Bulletproof go and charm that loser. I'll stay here, and be your bodyguard instead. Yeah, my baby, my sweet stove, your job is to keep me warm. And soften me up but, Bulletproof is my bodyguard. Boss, what will you do if that idiot sells us out? Give your ID, phone, and keys to Christmas Tree. You'll get them after our deal. You know our work is sensitive. We're going shooting now? You amateurs. Notch has the gift, he'll tip us on when to leave. Hey Notch! When did you say he would teach us to shoot? Later tonight! Praise to the ancestors. We'll go now and collect the guns, and then go learn how to shoot. A valuable piece of paper. I paid a lot of money for this. Now money is calling me. Do you know when 46 equals 47? Don't confuse me, teacher. Maths is not my thing. Welcome to school, soldier. Lesson one. Remove the company name from your back. Please don't mess up my uniform. You don't know my boss. Relax. I'll take them to the laundry. They'll dry clean and sew it. I'll even make a matching petticoat for you. We're behind by five minutes! Let's go! Let's go! Let's get on them! Save that petticoat for your blesser, I'm off to make my own money. Careful, don't shoot yourself. You drank all your rent money. Where are you going to sleep? You haven't been laid since Brenda Fassie. Where are you going to sleep... - you womanless idiot? - Look who is talking. - You're womanless like your father. - Leave my father out of this. Or what? What are you going to do? You didn't say we were going to break in. Lesson number two: Subtract the law, then you multiply the money. Oh God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Don't worry, when we're done, everyone will get their share. What if those guards hit a panic button? Why? Are you terrified? Mafia, hold the baby by the hand. Here's our present, gents. Hey, open it. The future is your funeral. Would you want to go away in a regular degular casket?' Or would you rather depart in the finest delicious, cambodied Mahogany? That's why with Hambakahle funerals, you depart in style. Hambakahle! The departure you deserve. Here's the answer to your homework, baby. Case number 46 equals 47. AK-47. Pass me my champagne. What is it? It's condom grease. It's cosmoline grease, you idiot. I'll show you how to clean it, fool. After you get us out of this hell hole! You see, he even knows the grease. We've got a professional. Hey! Come here! How are you, Chief? I'm fine, where is Bra Zakes? Zakes is very sick, my brother. He was sitting there with his partner earlier. Zakes just got sick, they replaced that guy with me, we swapped, but Zakes was sick. Come in 25, pickup Zakes, over. No man, this person is here. Can you hear that? He's in the toilet my brother. So when he's supposed to pay us, he get's diarrhea? Tell Zakes not to take us for shit. Go fetch him. Hurry up. As for me, I don't like to wait because the more I wait, the more I get thirsty. Come on Zakes, over. And tell those people to stop disturbing us, we're busy. Zakes is busy. Who are you? Give me the password. Give me the password. What's the password? All units code red at the warehouse! Hey! Pack and let's go. Let's run! That guy is bulletproof. - Viva! - Jackals? Viva! Bullet! Drop your weapons and surrender! You are surrounded! Out of my way! Looks like you failed your maths. How does it feel, teacher? Go fetch some paraffin. - Go! - You're messing with me! Notch, go and find the exit! You, come here. Take these. Fill them up. Come here! I have one left! I'm all out! They're carrying small guns. Let's draw their fire! Remember, brother, lesson number three. Remember to do your homework. They're coming! Move! This is your last chance, put down your weapons and surrender! Seretse call the mortuary, something smells rotten! Those dogs are dead now! Sir, tell me, are there anymore lessons for us? Class dismissed. Zakes! Do you see now? Now you owe us double. We want our money, and we want it now! We're going to catch those dogs if its the last thing we do. I swear. Bulletproof is up there in heaven now. I'm sure he's sparring with Mandela. But at least he's left us with you, soldier. You really did your thing last night. I just got us out, of the deep mess you made. Why didn't you tell me we were going to steal the guns? Look, we couldn't get the delivery. So we got a takeaway. Then I also want my takeaway. My payment. All of it. Sure. I'll give it to you after our deal. We are done, Sir. I showed you how to shoot last night. But our deal was that you were going to teach us to shoot like you. Was it also our deal that I lose my life also? Don't undermine me, I won't stand for it. Big Nunu. I told you, This one is a stripper. A soldier that dances for money. Piss off, you dog! I'll give you a bonus for last night. Bonus?! I said I don't want to hear anything about strippers! This person has showed us that he's trustworthy. He delivered! And in fact, from today I want us all to call him Service Delivery! Say it! Service delivery! Say it! It's on. Bulletproof. No! No! Get in! Let's go. Bullet! Bullet! You're our Bulletproof now, Service Delivery. And bullets just graze you. Let's go look at that. You're lucky it just grazed you. I heard, that yesterday you were shooting like Picasso. They say your rifle was like a paint brush. And if you wanted, you could have aimed at the moon, and shot it. You're a strong man. Those who saw it with their own eyes, were lucky. Bulletproof would disagree. No. They'd be singing gospel with Bulletproof on cloud nine if it wasn't for you. A man of action excites me. I wish I could have witnessed it. With your own eyes? No. You would have prayed that you were back home with your father, and that I'd never come here from the big city. You know sometimes, I dream about the big city. What's wrong? Why are you rejecting me? You... you are Puntsununu's girl. And it doesn't click to you that maybe I'm faking it with Puntsununu? Then clearly you deserve an award. The SAFTA is yours. I have to be convincing, this place is dangerous. What do you think the shooting lessons are for? Rhino poaching? Puntsununu told me that, I'm teaching them for protection. Protection? Wait, am I teaching them for robbery? You are teaching them for a revolution. You see, Puntsununu has this crazy idea, that he's going to seize the old factory, and re-open it run by the people of Sgodiphola. Run by those idiots? No way. Notch saw it in his dreams, and now they all believe it. Puntsununu is planning some cash robberies to set it up. He said it's going to be easy. He doesn't think a shot will be fired but what does he know? They're just a bunch of factory workers and small town thugs. But you on the other hand, you're big-time actress. Well, I managed to fool Puntsununu. He sent me to charm you. He said he needs your help. And you know, once these fools get into a gunfight... everyone's dead. So go and teach them. Get paid. If they come back alive, I'll also get my share. Then I'll come and find you when I start my career in the big city like a big actress. You know... you do smell just like the big city. Tell me... Tell me, my love... What these small-town boys intend to steal. Is it enough for, possibly paying school fees? Money enough for private school fees. I don't know, Puntsununu said they were going to start with a low-risk job. Something worth... five to six million. How much?! Million? Five, or six... Million. Gents, I'm joining you. I want to be part of the job. What job? You know what I'm talking about. I'm not the idiot around here. Equal contribution, equal share. I almost died for these guns. Okay, shop steward. 50,000 rand Sir, you've seen what I can do with a guitar. I can play this thing. Let me get what I deserve. Like an amapiano beat. 70,000 rand. Listen you stripper, to hell with your lessons. We know how to make this fart. Like last night Mafia? 100,000 rand. Okay. Equal share. Dig deeper, hurry up. No, man. You don't blink with your angle-grinder. Why are you blinking like hazard lights now? You dig like you don't want to ruin your make-up, what's wrong? Do you really want that factory? Then we have to dig like workers. Work together. Don't you agree? Isn't that true? We're in this together. Right? I say, Sgodiphola, let's do this. Learn to do dig, soldier or you won't make it here Learn to do dig, soldier or you won't make it here The star is coming, the red star is coming The star is coming, the red star is coming We did it brothers. Yes! We worked, we worked! Hold on, brother. What if there are surveillance cameras and GPS tracking? You know, once upon a time white people subjugated us with gunpowder. But Shaka defeated them, you know why? Because he had a plan and guts. We will attack them using the buffalo horns fighting formation. We have to be like Shaka, guys. You see? So that we can defeat their GPS and cameras. After that... we disappear. Boss. With all due respect, I am hearing you but you're not clear. What do you mean when you say we should disappear? Smally... Let me explain to you Smally... He is saying, he who owns technology, is the one who rules the world. It's clear because in Shaka's time technology was... gunpowder and ships. Hey, piss off! Stripper. You're busy talking rubbish about Shaka and gunpowder. We don't care about that. All that you are saying, is fart! We don't get your intentions here. What is it that you are hiding? You... Big Nunu, rebuke this boy! Talk to this boy! Do you know me? I'll smash you! Stop it! stop It! I also dreamt of this Mercenary. He tricked us into digging our own graves. You dream of nonsense, Notch. Digging graves in your sleep, is the first sign of madness. Okay. Noted. I heard you all. And I don't want to hear about that dream, Notch. I want inspiration. Tell us about the factory dream. Come closer guys. A red star appears in the sky. It reveals a new beginning. The factory was born again. We became our own bosses here in Sgodiphola. We didn't work for anyone, everyone of us were self-employed, and we employed our fellow brothers. Praise to our ancestors. Hey, praise them too. We acknowledge them. Just like the old days. Tell us the bit about the coal Notch. You sold the coal to the factory, so you were selling coal to yourself! Praise to the ancestors. Hey, I see small homes. I see squatter camps turning into mansions. Money is calling me. Gone with the cabbage smell! Praise to the ancestors. We ate meat every day! The money didn't diminish! I see Lamborghinis, agree! We agree! No more bathing in plastic tubs, now we bath in jacuzzis. I see rubber ducks, and our taps are made of gold. Agree? We agree! Hey, I see our children speaking polished English, saying "excuse me please". And going to the same schools as white kids. I see it happening, but not yet. Agree? We agree. Tell me, Notch, with everything you are mentioning, that has happened and hasn't happened. When did it not happen? The ancestors have never misled anyone. It was when two men, were in a truck. They turned to each other, talking about this very vision I have about Sgodiphola. Oh, yes! Hey, man. Ever got a feeling of déjà-vu? Deja vu? Dejavu? What's that in isiZulu? A déjà-vu, is when you have a feeling of something that is happening, but has already happened. You mean "what you have already seen". Déjà-vu Hey, come! Déjà-vu - Come, soldier! - Abracadabra! Hey, welcome to Sgodphola. Here's your present Workshop. Come! Check! Bring it! Let's go! - It's them right? - It's them. We found them. Just shoot! Shoot those dogs, man! The wheels! I said finish off those bloody dogs! Hey! There's another bag! Hey there. Come on, man! Come. Come! Come! Geez! I will get you sons of witches. Jackals! We did it! Just like we planned, my Delilah. You planned? I almost died! Was that your plan too? Relax, we came back for you. You came back for me. I am not stupid. You came back for money. What's wrong? You're jealous because Innocentia hurt you? Were you expecting nudes? It's her job. She's an actress and she works for Sgodiphola factory. She's my property. But don't worry. You'll get your money and you will be rich. But now I see that Mafia was right about you. You are a mercenary stripper. Can't you see what we're trying to do for our town? Listen here, brother. I've had enough of Sgodiphola nonsense. I want you to pay me all my money! I want to get out of this place! And then you can go on with your fairy tale. Fairy tale? You call our liberation a fairy tale! I'll show you "fairy tale". They were fired from the factory, I gave them shares, they're owners now. Hey! But you're their big boss, right? I am the CEO of Sgodiphola Industries. And if you weren't so dumb you'd be asking for a job in the transport department. I found these guys on the streets. I gave them a chance. And yet you call our struggle a fairy tale. Well if you pay my dues maybe I can respect this struggle of yours. Boss, are you are letting him into Uhuru and showing him all our secrets? He wants ice cream. Let's scoop him some diabetes. You want your parcel, right? You're always barking, howling for your money. Then take it. Hey no, no! Let me go! Let go of me! Service Delivery. You're such a dumb dog. You think I'd give you a bag with a million? And you can't even see it's a booby trap? We tried it all. Look... It's ink, stays on, doesn't come off no matter how you try wash it off. That's why you can't get your money now. That's why I built this lab, I hired the professor. All this money I stole long ago. I couldn't wash it, so it's worthless. I planned all this. You should have planned a bigger gang. What do you mean? I mean the minute you open this bag, you have one hour to wash off the security ink. - I know professor but... - Listen here, just as you said, this money will be worthless if you don't wash it. So you listen to me, the more hands you have in an hour, the more money you clean. These are the only hands we have. There is no one else I trust. You have to make a plan. No one else? The way I see it, I think there is. How are you? Mumsy! I need to talk to you. Just come in and talk! My child is so slow! He was premature. Are you cold Mumsy? Yes my child, add more coal. Let me try this. - No, man! - What's wrong? What are you doing? Are you still cold? - Let me warm you up with more hot cash. - What's this child doing? What's wrong with you? - I gave birth to an idiot! - Look at it, Mumsy. I have millions, and if you don't help me, it's all going to burn. My child, what kind of help do you need? I need cleaners. What kind of cleaners do you need? People who can wash with their hands. But won't gossip. So you want me to bring back my underground operation? Only with comrades we can trust. Mumsy, this money, we can leave it for Satan to burn it, or we can wash it for our liberation. - Are you in? - My child, I'm in. Anytime is tea time! Hallelujah! Those idiots, fire them! The real dogs are taking over. Okay. Yesss! Praise to the ancestors. We opened this one first. - Agree. - We agree. Including you, Mom. I agree my son. Lucky packet number one. I gave birth to a hero, a communist. A red sky at night. A thief's paradise. Bingo, you bloody dogs. Detective Dynamo! What on earth? My goodness! It's gone. I don't understand what's going on here, Chief. The tracker was zeroing in somewhere here when we lost it. Right here. Can you see? Vanished. First we prime the stained notes with fizzy drink like this. You see this juice? I call it the nine carat special. And then... Magic! And then... that's how you remove mayonaise from coleslaw. After an hour has passed, the ink won't come off at all. As you can see, you only have a window of 57 minutes left. My work here is done. Adieu. Let's do this. What are you waiting for? Let's work! Let's start with the pink notes. Bring more, bring more! You see, this is the warehouse. This side, it's the heist. And then the tracker appeared somewhere here. All in the same area. You know what I see chief, I see a pattern. I wouldn't say it's a dice jersey, but it's a pattern nonetheless. You're right Mailula. Go have a look out there. Look at all this money we couldn't clean in time. Put all the waste purple money in the fire. No, let's keep it. Mumsy, this stained money is evidence. They will catch you while you are still gambling "Fafi". Nonsense. In the coming years, they will make machines that are able to clean stubborn stains like these. Okay. We'll keep it for now. Guys. The money we managed to clean, is R655,000! We're rich. If we could get more hands we could clean it all. My mother will get us more hands tomorrow. Why tomorrow? Let's do it now tonight. Look, we can finish. Relax, you'll get all your money. You'll return to work Monday, a rich man, and you'll resign. We're tired now we want to celebrate, right guys? Sure! Sure! Last one to the party buys the drinks. Vrot-vrot. You're it. - Uhuru! - Uhuru! Guess what? You're compromising yourself. In three easy steps. One. You invite all your stinky friends from Sgodiphola to come around here. Number two. You make a drunken fool of yourself. - It was stress relief, Ma. - You're mad, what stress? And number three, you throw our hard cleaned money at people like you are feeding chickens. Don't you think these birds will figure out what you're up to? We said we were going to give back to the community. Giving back? You idiot. This community has to give back to us. We're finally making money and you want to give back. All you know is how to munch on those chips and you don't use your brain. What the hell is wrong with you? You love showing off, that's your problem. Where is the dirty money? Dirty money? I'm taking the mark of death off your back. I wish I could remove the mark of love from mine. You? It's clear that you love Puntsununu. That's why you were jealous yesterday and fought with that girl. I love you. No. Work with me here, Puntsununu mustn't suspect us. It's nearly the time to split the money. You... You are beautiful and an incredible actress. I want you to come with me to Joburg and get into television, because you're, top. You know what it is I want? That witch of a woman must eat humble pie. - And watch me on TV. - No, I'll be the first one to. Show me. Sort me out. Make me look good. Okay. The temperatures are about to get sizzling hot as we enter a heat wave today. The more the thermometer arises the region's get moist. The hotter it gets, they get wet. Hot and wet. Soaking wet. So you better cover up, well. I've got gumboots ready. And now for your spot. Talk to me my ancestors! Show me the future! Something big awaits in this bag! Viva. Jackals. Viva. It's Bullet. I had a vision of this thug. Taking all the animals and putting them in a zoo. Who is it, Notch? Him. Bulletproof is talking to us. He says you're the one who stole the dirty money last night. Last night when? Last night where? How so? Whilst I was too busy being attacked by your dogs, Mafia and them? Don't you dare accuse me. And this liar of yours. Says something big awaits in this bag. Well, let's see if it's the truth. Instead of being accused by Bulletproof from his grave. Let go! Let go! There we go! Same vicinity. The cards are on the table,over. Hey, Seretse. What are we betting for tonight? Let's play. For their lives. Over and out. You see... You see, its hundreds and fifties notes only. He said there was big money. If there were two hundreds, that would be "something big". I told you he is a fake. He's got a gift, he doesn't lie. Now that's something big. Move, move, carry on with the money! No! Christmas, let's go! Hey, pull yourself together! Follow him Innocentia, make sure he gets rid of that thing. It looks like they're in Chancers Hill area. They're armed and dangerous. Shoot to kill. I repeat. Shoot to kill. If the Delivery Man is stealing from us, then why is he helping us to get rid of the tracker. No, man! It's because he wants all the money, can't you see? Trust Notch's vision. Look, his van is open. Its the dirty money! Gambler 1 and Gambler 2. We see them! They are on Chancers Hill. They've gone off-road. They're in a lake. Call the scuba team. Wait! They are now on Dicer Street. Gambler 1, I'm heading east on Dicer street. Over. Gambler 2, I am heading west! They are right in front of you! You've got them! I think I see the lights! - I see the lights! - We got the Jackpot! Let's be done with this money before opening the last bag. Big Nunu, there's something I don't understand here. Have you ever noticed what's on this guy's number plate? ZOO 69, not the sex position, the GP number plate. Am I a traffic cop? No man, use your brain. Z! Double O, O! That's zoo! That's where the buffalo and lions live. That means Notch was right. We're rebuilding this town and he's busy looting it. He is looting. Big Nunu, that guy is a counter revolutionary of a stripper. A luta continua. It just goes to show you that you can't trust a man these days. I just want to know how he got it all out. The minute you turn your back, they are drinking and off with someone else. He must have had help. Go, Mafia. That's what I'm talking about, boy. Good Morning. Goodnight. As much as it is a beautiful day, I won't forget that some of you didn't believe I would deliver. Those rats are among us today. They are quiet. While I am the one bringing cheese for the people. Do they have anything to say now? On behalf of local municipality, we would like to mark the International Workers Day, with this grand opening, of Sgodphola Internet Cafe. PROUDLY DONATED BY ENERGINC - Viva Sgodphola Viva! - Viva! Who are you working with? No, Big Nunu! The truth gas thing doesn't work. That's for the White people. He needs something quick, like Cobra Kai. The ching-chong. - Listen! - Who do you work for? I thought we were friends, soldier. There is no need for all this beef. We're making ourselves look like dumbheads. Dumbheads from Sgodiphola. People without vision. Waiting for Notch's magic red star to appear in the sky is so stupid. Where is the red star Notch? It hasn't arrived yet. Not yet. Soldier, we are not like you. We live deep in the hole.

How did you do it? We did it doggy style. We went on to Missionary position. It wasn't sex, we made love. It was Innocentia. I maintained myself from climaxing by singing.

Puntsununu, you're the one who said I should charm him. I said hit him with a little panty. But you went all the way. You're a buffet. Puntsununu, you're responsible for this. This guy is here because of you. You're the one who stole his stove. - You idiot. - Idiot! - You're calling me an idiot! - No baby, no! It's you, who stole my stove. It was you. You put me in all this mess. Yes baby and they said they will kill me If I tell you. Even now they want to kill you for your share. Shoot them, baby. Quick. - Baby? - Baby? Hands up! You too hands up! Okay. Listen... we've expropriated all the stoves here in Sgodiphola, but we took them because they use the government's gas. And that gas bottle is killing our business. But that's doesn't matter anymore soldier, soon we'll open our factory. You can go take your stove, she knows where it is. Take it. And also take her back, the community pot, and go scrub it. I want my share. You took it already. You trust these dogs of yours? You took the dirty money and planted it in my van. Us? No, no. You wanted to frame me. But now I'm accusing you. Delivery Man, you see truth gas sometimes can make you a bit crazy. Which means I am telling nothing but the truth. Was it not you, who sent that hit man to kill me? And you, when your plan didn't work... Something big is coming! Him. You tried to frame me with a fake vision. That led to the dirty money you planted. No. You're mistaken. Was this also a mistake? Who does this belong to? Mr. Delivery Man, now I understand you. You see everyone in Sgodiphola has got one of these. Even Mumsy, everyone has got it. Boss, please don't trust this guy. Remember he took your cake and cut it. Sorry, sorry. I was not there. We were just playing. Take this! Kill him! We'll meet in hell. I will kill you today! I'll destroy you back to where you come from! No, Nunu. Don't move. Hands up. OK, time out. My love. Come. Innocentia... No man. Innocentia... Okay, but what should we search for? Money, just try it. Okay. Enter. Now type in sex. Geez, man. Gamblers! gamblers! We've picked up another signal from the tracker. Over. Bingo! Casino, we've got a Royal flush. Hurry, fix that chimney vent Workshop! I found the safe already open. But I took all the clean money. You take all the clean money. We'll get rid of the dirty money. - Boss please help me stretch! - Don't call me boss, you false prophet! Your visions have cost us. We're supposed to be in a jacuzzi now. Mafia is gone. Innocentia has been taken. We are busy destroying money. Gents, the cops are here! Goodness. This guy's not carrying a gun It's a TV remote. When I saw the red sky in the morning, I said it was a sign that the biggest criminal is going to prison. Sadly for our case there is no sign of the money. Not even one note. They really cleaned the area. Polished the street! What's that noise? The sound of progress. Energinc are demolishing the old factory today. Making way for a wind farm. Do you know a wind farm? Clean energy. Jobs are coming for the people. Seven jobs in total. In English they say, "It's the winds of change." A red star. Learn to do dig, soldier or you won't make it here Okay. Where did they go? Damn it! I'm really disappointed. Amazing scenes in Sgodphola today as purple stolen money rained from the sky. The local mayor was cornered on the scene by the crowd. I declare that this purple money is going to be legal tender here in Sgodphola until tomorrow. At the local tavern, a passing delivery man persuaded the community to share their money and buy a forest dream home in the development nearby. The delivery man and the entire community will share the home, rotating it to the holiday getaway from Sgodphola township. In other news... - Bra Joe. - Thirty-six! What's going on there? I have great news, Bra Joe. Looks like we will be neighbours in SgodIphola. The stove has been delivered. Who is this? Delivery Man can't speak at the moment. What do you mean he can't talk at the moment? If there's anything you want to say, say it to me. The Delivery Woman. Delivery Woman? Oh, so you're a double act now? You won't get double wages from me then. Not yet! Thirty-six! Hey man! Did you fix that lock? Thirty-six! Thirty-six! Thirty-six! Hey, man! Subtitle translation by Percy Smith
