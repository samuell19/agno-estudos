No one saw it coming. We were all looking out for big things. A nuclear accident, another Chernobyl. As the Russian republics split apart, no one knew who was responsible for what. While they were trying to figure it out, something leaked, something small. It rolled through Eastern Europe, moving west like a giant wave of death. They called it "virulent microphage." When the United States saw the potential for the disease on its home shores, it put the recent immigrants into quarantine camps. My husband Martin was one of those immigrants. So we interred with the rest of the masses. It was only supposed to be for a few months, but by the time Martin was killed, our baby was a young boy and the camp had become a city. The sick and the healthy. No one wants in, and no one gets out. Hey, man, take it down the alley, would ya? Don't you got no fucking manners? Hey, man! You better check it out. Shit! Shit. Aah! Help! Help! Help! Aah! Help! Help! How much time is there? A little over six hours. Then what? Then our subject becomes a blood bomb, and everything he touches turns to shit. And if that virus goes hot, everyone he touches... will be pissing blood and shitting out their guts! So what do you say we just do our job? Sir, we've got a location. "E" sector. Let's move! No one gets in, and no one gets out, unless you have a passport. And they're almost impossible to get. There are only two ways to get them. One way is to go into a government service, try to stay clean and healthy and earn your way out. The other is the black market. But unlawful possession is punishable by death. Mommy, I don't feel good. I know, honey. My bones hurt, Mommy. I know, but Mommy's got a special surprise for you. It's gonna take you to a special place and make you feel strong. Will Daddy be there? No, honey. Are you going to come with me? No. It's special just for you. Come home now, Mommy. Soon, baby. As soon as I can, okay? As soon as I finish here, I'll be right home. Now, you get some sleep now. I'll see you soon. Love you. Bye. You are at bat, rookie. Captain Rennard's office. ASAP, hm? I didn't do anything! No! Ah! Come on! Delon! Come here now. He wasn't human. He was a monster! You gotta kill him! Okay. Calm down. Just try and calm down! You believe me! You believe me, don't you? You gotta get him! But you better bring a fuckin' army! Thank you. I want you two to go out there and bring me the perps. Is that clear? Clear. Now would be a good time! Spacemen and monsters. You got your ray gun, rookie? Would somebody get this piece of shit out of my office? Thank you. There it is. Turn right. Radio went down. Confirmed. Here? Turn right at the corner. The dispatcher heard a scream. That's right. Look! There on the second floor. Let's go. Over here. Volker? Oh! Oh! Oh! Shit! Mayday, mayday. Officer down. Need assistance. Mayday! Come on, answer me, you motherfucker! State your position, condition. Metro Unit 1216. Officer Volker's dead. The others too. Is your position secure? How should I know? Just get me some backup! Can you maintain your current position? I'm down to my last clip. I have 12 rounds left. Get me some backup. How many suspects? One. There was... Hello? Come in. Hello? Shit! Hello! Can you take the call? This is Unit 7. We'll do it. What's a little more OT? Let's move in. Go. Go. Hold it! Hold it! Sit down! Did you get him? Who? You used the clip. Did you get him? I don't know. He's fast. Sneaky. Is your partner still alive? No. What about the others? Have you heard them? They're all dead. The thing tore 'em up. Tore 'em up? Cut off my partner's fuckin' head. We're going in. Fuck this. Suspect's still inside. We are going in. I'm not goin' in there. Yes, you are. That's an order. Fuck you. They owe me three weeks' back pay... I'm not... One of us is in there! You are going in. So what? He's dead. He's had his fuckin' head torn off. I mean, I feel sorry for the poor bastard, but me going in there isn't gonna make him feel any better. I'll go in there with ya. He's my partner. You sure? Let's go. Upstairs there's a room. He's inside. You two stay down here. I've got a bad feeling about this. Shut up. I'm scared enough without your fuckin' insecurities. He's gone! No, he can't be! He didn't get by me. Don't you fuckin' move! Look out! - You okay? - Yeah. - She got hit. - Down the stairs. You okay? Yeah. Down there. Call for backup. Call for backup. Piece of shit! Come on, let's go. Go. Good shot. That motherfucker. Aah, sh... He's in the vent! Lose him? Fuck this! Let's secure this area and send someone back for assistance. This guy could kill someone else! Kill? Eat someone else. Did you see what the son of a bitch did back there? He eats people. I know fuckin' food is scarce... How are we set for torches? Mine's dead. Any extra batteries? Okay, we'll use - one torch at a time. - I know this place. Do you think anybody gives a shit if we catch this guy? Why do we have to be heroes? This leads to an old prison. The dungeon's below us. Yeah. The good old days, huh? There's only one way in. If he goes into the prison, we have him trapped. Don't we have him trapped now? No, the vent leads to the prison complex. Either he goes into the prison, or he comes out the other side of this building. How do you want to play it? How are we gonna do this? The guy's gone. You and I go in the vent. You two go around and block the other way out. Maybe we can trap him between us. Go! I can't believe you're makin' us do this. Take your vest off. Take it off. Come on! Fake passport. You could get into a lot of trouble for those. It's the only way out of here. There's no hope. All the good people are leaving. That's why there's no hope. What? Let's go. Get your torch. I've got one team down, another team missing. I had a man sitting in that chair just this morning, screaming about monsters and spacemen, and now I look up and I see a real live army colonel and a goon from some agency wondering about what's going on in sector "E." Look, um... Captain. I appreciate your feelings. I'm sure we both do. The man we're looking for is infected with a new virulent form of malaria. Extremely violent tendencies... Does ripping off your head fall into the category of violent tendencies? Captain, we're gonna need to work together on this one. Now, I need you to tell your men not to touch the suspect. The disease is spread by bodily fluids. You, uh, following me so far? Gentlemen, he's all yours. I will find their positions, and you can have him. Thanks for your help. Malaria? Do you really think he believes that? I don't care what he believes. We need more men on this. Why are we cuttin' off the cops? In two hours, our carrier becomes contagious. Tomorrow, 5,000 people are either dead or psychotic. Now, I don't even want to think about the next day. We put information like that out on the cop network, and we got our boys in blue packin' up their wives and kiddies and haulin' ass out of here, starting a bona fide panic. We don't want that. We're gonna work on this one ourselves. No cops. Right? Right? This tunnel looks clear! Nice touch. What is it? Nothing. There is a piece of metal here! Use your torch! Got it. And tell me if you see anything. What? I wasn't talking to you. We got a junction coming up, so be ready! How'd he do that? He went in three different directions. I don't know. Take this one. Call out if you find anything. Don't take any chances. I need you to do it. I don't think he's down there, but we have to check it out. All right. Aah! Oh! What the hell was that? Come on! Aah! Motherfucker! Stay there! He's got a gun. You okay? Flashlight. Turn it off. Quiet. Shh. You okay? Couldn't be better! I'm comin' down! No! Stay there! He might double back and trap both of us down here! Oh, God! Close call. Yeah. Really. Flashlight. Hold this! What is it? We've reached the prison. Hey! Flashlight! Okay. Climb on down. Slowly! Keep your feet on the back wall, and you'll be okay. That's it. Yeah, I got it. Don't shoot! Guys. Did you see him? Who? Who do you think? He must've come by you. We didn't see anyone. We heard the shot and got here maybe 10, 15 seconds later. Then we heard you in the vent. We thought you were the suspect. He must've gone by you. Did he get you? That son of a bitch got a gun. Shit. No one got by us. Fuck. The other door. That means he's in there! Motherfucker's in jail! There is no other way out. We have him trapped. What do you mean? This was once a prison. It's too easy. Man, what is your problem? My problem is we gotta confirm his capture. He's right. Do I have your support in this? We have to be sure. It's our job, isn't it? Stand back! Don't fuckin' do this! Flashlight. Aah! Get him out of here! Get up! Come on! Get out of there! Motherfucker! You better go in and get that son of a bitch! He can't get out. We've got him trapped. We know that... You have to make sure! Are you insane? Nobody's goin' in there. No fuckin' way. We've done enough here. Look at your fuckin' knee! Look. He doesn't know where he is. He knows exactly where he is. Exactly! The son of a bitch! There can't be another way out. Oh, come on! You keep on saying there is no other way out! How do you know? How? Somebody's got to go get some help! All right? Okay All right. Maybe he should call for help. Yeah. I could go for help. Good fuckin' idea, rookie. Your ammo. What? Leave it here. It's all right. Calm down. Relax. You're spooked. Get your fuckin' shit together. Who's there? Wocek, is that you? Fuck! Come on, son of a bitch piece of shit! Yah! Uuh! Fuck. Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, God. Help! He's here! What'd he say? Cuzo? Cuzo! He screamed. Maybe he tripped or something. Maybe there's another way out, and that fucking maniac got him. Shut up! There's no other way out. You're gonna have to go after him. See if he's okay. You can do it. Cover me. Cover me! Cuzo? Cuzo! You son of a bitch, answer me! Help! Don't let him lock us in! Fuck. Shit. The vent. The vent! The vent! You've got to find a way to keep it open! Ugh! Ugh! Shit! Shit! How long before he goes off? Sir, we have a witness who may have seen where the carrier went. Is that the lady, soldier? Yes, sir. Which way did you see him go, ma'am? She's German, sir. No English. Get me someone who can speak to this woman. What do we do? He got out! He could not. Yes he did! Calm down! Stop telling me to calm down! We're fucked here! We'll be if you don't calm down! So shut up! How is she? Bad. What do you want me to do? Find a way out. If we stay here, we'll die. No one's gonna find us. That whiny bastard went to get help. Killer got him. You heard the scream. Maybe he got away. We can't risk it. You gotta find a way out. How? Where do I look? Over there! He got out. So can you. How does he know so much? I was asking myself exactly the same question. He knows about police procedure. He knows about the prison. Maybe he was a... A cop or a guard, or... Or a fucking prisoner. You think that's why he's doing this to us? Revenge? He planned this whole thing? Maybe not at first. But now... Lie down. Lie down. Come on. Ah! You son of a bitch! Agh! Uugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ah! Uh! Oh, fuck! Oh. Uh. Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh! Shoot the motherfucker, shoot! Uh! You okay? We need you to be okay. Keep it together. Go for help. Through the cell block. Lemieux. You won't die. We won't die. Hang in there. Go for help. Go! Shit! Fuck! Ah! No! Leave 'em alone, you son of a bitch! Ah! It's all right, officer. We're here to help you. Where is your team? Who the hell are you? Where's the carrier? Is he alive? Contamination suits? Officer... What have you done to us? Listen to me. We've got 40 minutes to get in before that guy goes hot. And we're gonna find your team, do you understand that? Officer, are you all right? Look at me. We're losing time. We've gotta go back in. Can you do this? Team A, let's move. If he's not contagious, why are you wearing those suits? Protocol. What is it? Spread out. Carrier's in the area. Be ready! Be ready! He's close, people. Look out! Officer. Officer. You're it. You gotta get this guy while there's still time. Listen. If he lives, everyone else dies. You understand me? If I don't come back, you make sure that gets to my son and he gets somewhere safe. You hear me? I hear you, officer... Officer Delon. Delon. Please. Please. Don't kill me. I want to live. Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Argh! Argh! Argh! Son of a bitch! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! No! Come on! Don't! Don't. Don't! No! No! Please! Don't! Come on. No! No! No! Aah! Kick! Uh! Uh! Brace your feet against the pipe! Give your hands some slack! Come on! Get those flamethrowers in here now! Clear the way! Coming through! Officer Delon! Easy. That'll do, corpsman. Go on, beat it. Yes, sir. You know the penalty for this. Sergeant. Take this woman, get her son, and escort 'em across the border. Come with me, ma'am.
