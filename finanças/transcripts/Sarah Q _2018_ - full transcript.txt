Sweetheart, time to get up, okay? Sarah, uh, you gotta know this, if...

Just don't j... jinx the kid. It's... She'll do fine. What are you doing? I'm... I'm giving her an alternative. It's not... I'm not saying don't do it. But she knows she has a house here. Well, but I wanna tell her she can always come back here and it's not a big deal. Oh God, just... I... I... It's not a failure, right? I... I know. I and... I mean it's probably not for me, but I'll take it one day at a time, so yeah. Well, just don't listen to anybody. You do your... you own thing, okay? Especially, grandma, okay?

We love her and she can do anything here That she could do there. It's a terrible place, New York. - You're jinxing her. - It's very dangerous. You're jinxing the kid. - I'm not jinxing... - Guys, it's okay, it's okay. It'll be fine, guys. Oh, it's not a jinx, I'm just giving her alternative. She knows she's got a home here forever. Why are you pushing around? Guys, it's okay. It's okay, I'm gonna be great. I promise you, - I... I will... - I'm sure you're gonna be just fine. How's your time, honey? Well, we're good to go, we have a couple more minutes. Okay, baby, you just watch your step out there. Watch out for shady people. New York is full of shady people. You be careful, 'cause you're a good girl. Your father was a bum you know, and your mom was a very troubled spirit. But you're not either of them, you're your own, kid. And you got me as a grandpa and the apple does not fall far from the tree, okay? Don't worry, grandpa. I'm gonna go to New York and I'm gonna crush it. You know, I'm gonna conquer it. Oh. Just give me a month, two tops, - and I'll own the town. - You'll own the town. You're a monkey, come on. You're a wonderful kid, you'll do fine, okay? Anything you need, just jump on the phone, okay? I love you, grandpa. Yeah. But you ain't got enough money. I do. Yeah, I'll be... I'll be okay. Oh, give me some. Your grandfather was one cool cat when I knew him. He was? Of course, he was. So I'm here to help in any way I can. Just let me know if you need anything, okay? Thank you, Helena. You know, the best criteria for getting a New York apartment or not is whether something moves on the floor when you walk in. Ha! Well, nothing ran on the floor, so I guess I'm good. Your first day? Does it show? I'm looking for the financial aid office. It's right here. I'm Philip. - Sarah. - Come on. Thanks. - I know, I know... - Hmm. A banana is a healthier source of potassium than potato chips. Me, I'm hooked on potato chips and I don't mean - the organic shit either. - I hear you. - I'm Sarah. - Luna. My parents smoked a lot of weed. This is Josie. How small a town are you from anyway? Does it show that much? Oh yeah. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone knows what everyone ate for breakfast. You? Queens. Nobody knows nothing. Jersey City. Nobody cares. Like nobody. - I'm Sarah. - Jasmine. Nice to meet you, new girl. So do you guys have any advice? Any tips? Regarding? Living in New York City. Oh wow! Oh, this is gonna be good. Gee, I don't know if I'm really the person to ask. She's not the person to ask. All I can say is get used to lots of noise. And the filth. And totally disgusting smells. Like smells you never knew could exist. - And rude behavior... - Totally rude. Just be ready for anything. And everything. And totally fucking disgusting smells. Don't forget that, I'm serious. Gotcha. Um, did I miss anything important first semester? Not a fuckin' thing. Oh! Excuse me, I'm sorry. Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. You... you're my new neighbor, right? Oh, um, I guess. Uh, I'm Sarah. Sarah Quintana. Frankie. Frankie Li. It's nice to meet you. Um, long night? Long night, long day, turned to long night. You keep odd hours, Frankie Li. Saving life has no time clock. I'm in the liquid therapy business. I own a bar. Oh. Oh, good to know. Um, guess I'll see you around. Yeah, see you around. I meet nothin' but neurotics and head-cases in this city. So I start this online dating thing since my wife flew the coop. No luck. But I went out on a date with this woman, she was a prison guard and she had a personality - to match. - Hmm. She's a delicate flower. No. This girl kicked both our asses before breakfast. I'm talking about Sarah. Who the hell is Sarah? The girl that just moved into my building. Did you make your move? What move? Not yet. What are you waiting for? You ain't gettin' any younger. Listen, come here, let me see something. Open up your mouth. Ah. Listen, I can't send you into battle with dirty teeth if this girl's all you said she is. I gotta clean you up. Mm. You need new headshots. Listen, uh... uh, I gotta guy. So anyway, where do you see yourself, Miss Sarah, in the next five years? Oh, jeez. Um, five years. Um, well, I mean I... I'd like to do like film, TV. Um, you know, like serious drama you know, um, m... more specifically serious drama like... uh, like Shakespeare in the Park. Um, and... yeah, I mean I... I'd really like to do like some day player, recurring roles you know, - build my résumé. - Look, the reason why I'm such a great agent is I'm realistic. You come in with these big dreams, I'm here to stomp them out, and maybe on the way, you and I can make some dough. You dig? I think I'm gonna sign you, not because I like you, because I think you and I, we could make some money together. And you can learn a little about the business. Anyway, you have a short skirt? Yeah. I mean really, really, really, - really short skirt. - Um, I guess. - Heels? - Yeah. - Tall? - Yeah. Nudity. How about nudity? You do nudity, right? Oh, um... I don't know. I mean I guess it would really have to depend. There goes HBO. Uh, am I gonna get sent out for like TV, film, in like commercials? Yeah, princess, I'll get you on uh, Gossip Girls, Gossip Guys, Sex in the City you know, things like that. Those shows aren't on anymore and uh, the Gossip Guys isn't a show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I'll call you when I need you. By the way, what's your last name? Quintana. Quintana. Quintana? Way too ethnic. How about Sarah Q? You know, like... like Suzie Q, but... Sarah Q. I think I could sell that. Sarah Q. Um, can I ask you why are... Why are these pictures covered up? Well, I used to bang all these chicks, I don't wanna see their faces anymore. And this dude uh... Long story, I was in college and uh, he was actually pretty good, I had a crush, so I kinda keep it there. Okay. Bob, what happened to your hand? I got bit. Dog? - 10-year-old. - Aw, my dog is 10. Not a dog, my patient. Glad I don't have a job that runs the risk of getting bit. You don't have a job. Hey, being unemployed is a fulltime job, alright? Yeah, so is finding decent woman in this town. Phew. Kasey, how come we never went out? How come you say my name wrong? Kasey. It's not Kasey. It's K.C. Like Kansas City. Okay, K.C., how come we never went out? Oh, I just really don't wanna ruin our friendship, Bob. Come on, K.C., ruin our friendship, please! Bob, take it down a notch. - Too desperate? - Oh yeah. - Oh, excuse me. - Uh, you're excused. Well, hey there, handsome. Oh, handsome. Oh, she thinks I'm handsome. - How are you? - Good. Uh, I have an oral fixation. Oh. Pistachios? I think you should start doin' some special events - in your bar. - Like what? You know, buy one, get two free, somethin' like that. - Like you guys been getting. - How about this? - Get two and get four free? - How about this? What? You spend $100, $20 for a cleaning at my dentist place. What's a classy guy like you doin' in a dump like this? Oh, we like this dump um, joint. Place. What are you drinkin', miss? - Ooh! - Phew! Let me think. God, there is just so many choices. Right. You guys just let me know when you're ready. What do you recommend, big boy? Um, I don't know. What do... what do you... what do you like to drink? Hmm, something sweet. Like you. S... s... sweet? She... she thinks I'm sweet. People spend $100 on alcohol, they come to my office, get a free cleaning, but they have to be beautiful women. You uh, lookin' for someone? Yeah, the... the chick that was just here. - The blonde with the tits. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, really? - You mean my wife? - Yeah, the... no... No. - Hey, you done with class for the day? - Yep. Cool. Let's hang. - Oh, I can't... - Uh, Homburg at 6:00. What? Barry Homburg. His classes are the psychological equivalent of undergoing a Nazi medical experiment. Whoa. Anyway, can we hang or what? I can't. I actually have a meeting with a manager. Awesome. Who's the manager? Um, have you heard of Alessandra Berry? No. What's the difference between an agent and a manager, anyway? - 5%. - Okay. You have a real commercial look. You mean, like for commercials? Commercials, pilots, features, web series. So where is your office located? Right here. In this building? In this restaurant. Wherever I happen to be, that's my office. I see. Ladies, how is everything? Just fine. - Can I get you anything else? - No, but you could leave. Uh. - Sure. - Good. Um, so uh... uh, how long have you been a manager for? Two months. I used to be an assistant for Roger Savage. Roger Savage. Oh, you know him? I've heard of him. Yeah, he sleeps in his office and he's really fucked up. Uh, what's your last name, again? Um, Quintana. Oh, that's so fucking perfect. Wait, really? You don't think it's too ethnic? Ethnicity is in. Diversity, kid. - So I shouldn't change my name? - No. It's never been more advantageous in this business to be anything other than a white man. They don't... they don't show you movies here, do they? I wish. Well, it's up to you, you're on your own. You absolutely must know vintage cinema. Like old movies? Like our cinematic legacy. If you haven't seen Tay Garnett's One Way Passage from 1932. It's not an old movie, it's a new movie. Why did you want to be an actor, anyway? It's all I've ever done. It's all I wanted to do. It's all I can do. What's the most important thing about acting? An agent. Obviously. You gotta know the work of Spencer Tracy, Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara, Edward G. Robinson. How many of you have heard of John Cassavetes? How about Wild Bill Wellman? Who? What movies have you made, Mr. Cavallo? Look it up on IMDB. I'm not gonna give you my résumé. And remember, the best directors are total film geeks. If you can, you can score major points with them if you talk cinema classics. That's awesome advice. It's not awesome advice, it's the fuckin' lexicon. Blondie, what are you practicing to be? The next Marilyn Monroe? So what about TV? Oh, the poor man's cinema! I hope they pick up your pilot. In film acting, you get to underplay naturalistic acting. I want to be on Broadway. Oh yeah? What time do you wanna leave? It's all in the diaphragm. Ariel's Song from The Tempest. "Hark, hark! Bow-wow. The watchdogs bark. Bow-wow. Hark, hark!" Alliteration, Jasmine. Peter Piper's Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect Pronunciation. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

If I never find the right someone, if I end up all alone, if I never find the person to have the sweetness and the pain of life with, if I never have children to take care of me when I'm older then... Then I'll end up all alone, by myself, I don't want that. Who wants that? You think I do? You do? I want a real live flesh and blood soul mate, goddammit! I just know I'll never have it. I just know it. I mean let's fucking face it, I'm on the lonely road to nowhere. Very good, Josie. Thank you. Natural, real, present. Thank you, Miss Mashmeyer. Oh, Miz, if you please. I'm no longer an ingénue, Although, I'm often mistaken for one. Yez, Miz Mashmeyer. Cute. Sarah, let's hope this week is better than last. Fuck me. Walk with presence, with a sense of self. Stand up uh, stand up straight. What is it that you're hiding? D... do you all see this, class? We can learn from her ineptitude. I mean do you even wanna be an actor? Why are you here? Of course I wanna be an actor. Do you see how she pauses? It's because she is not clear. Can I please sit down, Miz Mashmeyer? No. Aw, are you crying? - Why are you crying? - I'm not crying. Is it because you're a little girl? Woman up, Sarah. Grow a pair and stop being such a pathetic girl who's all about her looks. God, your weakness is just embarrassing to all of us! It's a good thing it's also a very good lesson for the rest of the class. Can I please sit down, Miz Mashmeyer? Oh, oh, I don't know. Can you? Class, acting is raw. It is real, it is visceral. When Meryl Streep was still in class, she walked out amongst her peers, took center stage, ripped up her skirt, and took a giant steaming dump. Now that... That is acting. Class dismissed. Hey, how do you afford a place in the Village? Every struggling actor I know lives in either Bed-Stuy, Bushwick, Greenpoint, Washington Heights, Jersey City, maybe Actoria. What's Actoria? Astoria to most people. Oh, um, the landlord is an old friend of my grandpa, so she's giving me a huge break on rent. Hmm. I'm thinking about leaving. Leaving? Leaving New York and going back home. Said every wannabe who ever came here. Ended up 30 pounds overweight with a red pickup truck parked out front, a recycling bin filled with empty cans of Coors Light, three rugrats runnin' around and another one on the way, in a town where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business. You should write prose. Sarah, this just in. Life is a motherfucker. Life in Manhattan is a motherfucker on steroids. Tryin' to make it in show business is a motherfucker on steroids multiplied by 2. No, by... by 10. So let me get this straight. I'm dealing with, what? Four motherfuckers, three of which are on steroids? You can't quit yet. I won't let you. You need to stick around, see how it all ends, right? I mean, all you need is one break. I know just... Even with the break I'm getting on rent, it's just so expensive. Mm-mm, true. So how do you manage? Daddy's rich. Oh, that helps. You... you really wanna make some extra cash? I might have an idea. Of course. This might involve a little... how do I put this? Under-the-radar activity. Were you followed? Um, followed by whom? Exactly. Come in. Um, I can't stay very long. What, you gotta catch your bus? Huh? I'm Mr. Danny. I'm Sarah. Sar... Please, no last names. Sit down. Do you know why you're here? Not sure. Good. How are you with names and faces? Um, I don't know. Even better. Look, I need you to run a little errand. No big deal. I'll give you three C notes. You look a little disappointed. Is that your way of negotiating? Oh, no, I... I don't... don't exactly... Okay. And here's another C note. Take it. Thanks. Now, let me cut to the chase. I want... Now, that's Mr. Tommy. Hey. What do you hear, what do you say? Hi. Don't mind him, he's good people. Now, I want you to pick up a piece of luggage for me and bring it back here. Can you do that? Yeah, sure, I guess. Um, is there a specific piece or style that you want? Yes, there is. This key. Yes. Hey, kid. Be a good kid. Bring me back a piece of cheesecake. Okay, seriously, what did you get me into? I go to this disgusting apartment and there's these two creepy old guys there. Where are you now? They gave me some key to pick up a piece of luggage at a locker. Let me guess. The bus station? No, a bowling alley. Hey. Aren't you gonna ask me if I was followed? Followed by who? Whom. Yeah, whom. Whom on the range, where the deers and the antelopes play. I see you made it back in record time. Probably ran all way after you shit your pants, am I right? Not entirely true. And you forgot my cheesecake. I'm sorry. Good work. Yah, let's not gloss over this cheesecake thing or lack of thereof. I have to go. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag? Come on, you must be curious. Uh, I think I should leave. Bada bang. Cute, ain't it? Wait, is that filled with heroin? Like... like in that movie with Audrey Hepburn? Movie? She's talkin' about the movie Wait Until Dark. Richard Crenna was in that. Alan Arkin, too and they both young. But it wasn't a teddy bear, it was a doll, creepy young girl. Excuse me, sir? No, not you. The young girl in the movie Wait Til Dark. It wasn't Wait Until Dark, it was Charade with Cary Grant! Wait, I'm a drug mule. Uh, I am not stuffing anything inside any body cavities. Nobody is stuffing anythin' in your ass. Unless you want 'em to. No drugs inside, nothin' inside but the factory stuffin' from Taiwan. Today was just a test. What? Uh, what do you mean? A test for what? To see if we could trust you. And to see if you were competent. A little bit of both. Trustworthy and competent, good characteristics for anyone. So you were just screwing with me? If you call $400 merely "screwing with you", then salud, Miss Sarah. Did you see that movie Ted? This guy looks like the guy Ted. Mr. Danny. Mr. Tommy. - It's Mr. Danny. - It's Tommy. It's Danny. Whatever, that guy, he's a friends with the uncle of some dude I was doin' a few months back. Charming. 10 points. - Hey, girls. - How's it going? Just tryin' to help Sarah with a little gainful employment. Yeah, what do you guys do for money? Don't ask. - Lap dances. - That's funny. We're strippers. Wait, seriously? Where? Never in the city. You never know who's gonna walk through the door. Right, like New Jersey and Long Island. Anywhere except Manhattan. We can hook you up, Sarah. No experience necessary. Um, no thanks. I think I'll just stick with Luna's friends. Suit yourself. Let us know if you change your mind. Um, thank you. Who do I have to kill to get some service around... Oh my God! In the corner! - It's K-Square. - Wait, Kate Kerrigan? - Where? - Back there. Oh my God, she is only legit movie star to come out of our school in decades. Is it like super uncool if we go and talk to her? Hell, yeah. - Fuck it. - Let's go. So sorry to bother you. The four of us actually go to the same school as you. - As you did. - That you went to. Conservatory. - Is that the new Bradley... - Is Mashmeyer still there? Oh, yeah. She hated me. Wait, really? She hates me, too. And Sheldrake? Mmhmm. My ass was always black and blue after his class. What about that prick, Homburg? Still a prick. Yeah, well, you should watch out for him. So could you come speak at our school sometime? I'd rather contract small pox. But really, let me ask you something, did any of you have to audition to get in? Of course not. They'll take anyone who can pay. Uh, no offense, girls. And believe me, they do nothing to prepare you for the real world, for the realities of the business. So, how did you make it then, Miss Kerrigan? You've only been out for a few years. Luck? Some luck, but mostly really hard work. I started out doing student films, short films, even background in big movies. Yuck, extra work? Don't knock it. That's how I got into the union and I was upgraded twice. 1,000 bucks a day. Not a bad day's work. And when you get out of conservatory, keep taking classes. There are so many good places to study like One on One on West 27th Street, And for God's sake, create your own work, short films, plays, one-person shows. Damn, I really wish I could keep talking, but I have a meeting with my agent. Thank you so much for your time, Miss Kerrigan. Oh, and most important, don't drink the Kool-Aid. Hey, let's go, Katie. Car's waitin' outside. Ladies, my agent, Abram Bernstein. Are you looking for any new clients? What have you done? - Nothing yet, but I'm abo... - I did a commercial for public access. Me, too. Um, we have a showcase coming up at our school - pretty soon. - Great. So call me when you've done something. Somethin' professional. Ready? And you should think about gettin' a nose job. - I do not need that. - Bye. I know the drill, I wasn't followed. You're a little fuckin' wise-ass. I like that. Mr. Tommy. What do you want? This little wise-ass friend Sarah is back. I don't feel totally comfortable with all this. Then why'd you come back? I just want to know what it's all about. Well, come back tomorrow, we'll take a little field trip. Michael Kors hand bags. - Hmm. - Hermes scarves. Rolex watches. North Face jackets. Nike sneakers. - Watches... - Right. All this beautiful stuff and it's all fake. Right. And don't forget the Beats by Dre headphones, I use 'em myself. - So you guys are... - We're in the wholesale/retail business you might say. Well put. Sarah. You can take great pride that you're a cog in a well-oiled machine. A small cog, but an important cog. We can't offer you medical and dental, but your gross pay is your take-home pay. Federal, state, city taxes, you are exempt, my friend. By the way, you play softball? What? Well, we need a shortstop for our company softball team. You don't have to hit much, but you know, make a few plays in the field. What if the cops find out about this place? About the softball team? I was just kiddin'. We don't have a softball team. No, no, about this place. This... this well-oiled machine. We are the cops. Retired. But once a cop, always a cop. Right, Tommy? You got that right. Semper blue. All you have to do is make a pick up every day and bring it back here. A pick up? I assume you don't mean another teddy bear? No. Just the daily haul from this place. I don't know. I mean it seems dangerous. Sarah, you're just the messenger. No one ever kills the messenger, right? I mean if you were a guy, I'd tell you to grow a pair, but I think you have a pair already, but you just don't know where they are yet. - I don't know what you're talking about. - No, no, no, no, please, let me finish here. You have a conscience. This jungle of a city hasn't taken that away from you yet. I had a conscience once, and so did Mr. Danny. Well, let me allow you in on a little secret. No one has ever made it through this world without cutting any corners. Not the homeless guy sleepin' in front of your buildin', not the Mayor of City of New York, not the richest man on Earth, and the key is to cut the right corners and not push your luck. We are offering you gainful employment here. Low risk, high reward. You may get arrested once or twice, but that's par for the course. But nobody's gonna hurt and that's not a small thing. So I've decided I'm no longer gonna work for Mr. Danny anymore. Just too wrong. So are you back to the whole quitting thing again? You mean like leave town? - Yeah. - No. I just need to find a respectable job. I guess my career as a waitress is inevitable. You mean nanny. Like baby-sitting? Sarah, haven't you heard nanny is the new waitressing? Alright. Hey. How we doin'? Business is goin' great, boss. - There is a lot of orders comin' in. - Oh yeah. The phone's ringin' off the hook. What about that girl? - She called me back? - Not that I'm aware, no. Keep an eye on her, and get me a cup of coffee, and hurry back. I assume that you're like every other socially-awkward millennial and you spend the vast majority of your time with your face buried in front of your... your iPhone, right? Pretty much, except I actually don't have an iPhone. I have a Blackberry. A Blackberry. Oy. Well, listen, my kid's not like that. You see, she spends most of her time with her face buried in books. That's a novel concept, isn't it? She's not a whore, my Heather. I think that's great, Gail. So I'm just gonna be... I'm gonna be brutally upfront and honest with you, and if you have a problem with anything I'm about to say, then you can just get the fuck out of my house. Of course. Please do not use any foul language in front of my kid. If I find out you're doing that, I'm gonna take your mouth and I'm gonna drag it out in the street. Y... and if you bring your boyfriend up here and I find out that you guys are sucking or fucking, I don't know what you people do, I'm gonna break both your legs. And drugs? Don't even get me started on that! Do you use Molly? Sorry, who's Molly? If you bring any drugs into my house that are stronger than a baby aspirin, I'll break both your legs. Then, and only then, will I take you to the police. Have I made myself perfectly clear? Clear as a bell. Welcome to my house. I'm done with my homework. Awesome. And are you girls hungry? Uh, tough question. Okay, let me re-phrase that. Um, are you girls hungry? Right now, all I do is binge and purge. That's not a good idea, Heather. Um, Lola, doesn't Sarah look fat? Totally. I think she's doing the binge without the purge. Total porker, needs to purge. - Excuse me? - Do you wanna get high? Shit, yeah. - What are you talking about? - Get high. Yeah, I have some Buddha stick up in my room some junior high kid sold me. Nice. I think this conversation is over. Okay, you're not into it, that's fine. Just don't tell my mom, okay? She's still pissed that I got dropped back a grade. Again. Fine. I'm think I'm gonna dress like a sexy witch - for Halloween. - Hmm? - You know like red lips, big hair, boobs, ass... - Yeah. - Everything. - I love it. Wait, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Not yet. - Okay, give me that shit. - Right on! No, not right on, okay? This is ridiculous. Sarah, how many guys have you fucked in your life so far? Jesus Christ. - Just curious. - What? Aren't you like 14? 15. I'm not a virgin. Oh, gross! Oh, I let two boys finger me last month, and then I let one of them fuck me, but he didn't - come inside me, so... - Okay, you need to shut the hell up! My mom hates it when babysitters curse around me. Well, your mom is delusional. I did not understand why I needed to babysit girls that were basically my age and now I do, and I'm no longer your babysitter. Wait, you're leaving? Correct. What a pussy. Don't ever use that word. What word? Uh, you know what word. The... the P-word. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Sarah, please don't leave. I'm so sorry. I... I know I messed up, but my mom's gonna kick my ass for this. Look, you girls do not need to grow up so fast, okay? Just be kids. You're right. - Do you wanna do some Molly? - Oh yeah. Got the fake IDs, bitches. Let's party! Oh, you want one? 50 bucks. I'm in. Hey, Mr. Tommy, look what the cat dragged in. Yeah, you said she'd be back. Fuckin' cheesecake, give me the run. The money is good. And it's harmless, right? I mean nobody's getting hurt. A victimless crime if there ever was one. Just don't live above your means. What do you mean? Don't flaunt it. Keep it to yourself. The last thing you wanna do is draw attention to yourself. So I shouldn't buy that new apartment, should I? Not yet. Troy Remy is one director that you want to be obsessed with you. I mean have you seen his last film The Fault Within? No. It's friggin' intense. Uh, is it on Netflix? I have no idea, check it out. And at one point, he pulls out a Blackberry. You believe that? A fuckin' Blackberry. Hey, ladies, what's happening tonight? How you doin'? - Yeah, no, just... - Yeah. So Troy was wondering if you might like to join him. So why doesn't he ask me himself? Is that really what you want me to tell him? Are you sure? Absopositively? Okay. Right then and there, I knew this guy was a clown. Someone not worth any of my time. Could you freshen this for me, sweetie? White wine spritzer. Heavy on the spritz. You want me to get you another drink? Isn't that your job? White wine spritzer. Um, I can get you another drink, but it's not my job to get you another drink, sweetie. I'll get you another drink though, 'cause it's the polite thing to do. Never mind. Nice dress. I still shoot on film. Fuck digital. And fuck those YouTube and Snapchat hacks. I'm the true heir to John Ford and Howard Hawks. Ladies, I got an idea. To me, the real party is the after-party. I think it's time I gave everyone their walkin' papers except for you two. No after-party. My girl Sarah has three big auditions tomorrow. Two studio features and an indie. That's cool. That's cool. Live for another day. I get it. Good luck on that audition. Hey. Why are we leaving so early? I thought you said you wanted him to be obsessed with me. And he is. But I also want him to think that other directors are obsessed with you. Look, if you wanna go fuck his brains out tonight, feel free. Go back up there. You'll get your chance with him and he knows it. Yeah. Hmm. If she's as pretty as you say, you better kick-start those moves of yours. Otherwise, one of those Wall Street douche bags is gonna pounce on her. What? She's not the type that go for a Wall Street douche bag. Don't be so sure of that. These girls come from small town USA and they get dollar signs in their eyes. Make your move, Frankie. Make your move. Thank you so much. Have a lovely night. Thank you. Oh, no, no, no. - No way! - What? I can't let you pay. We split it 50/50. I pay for all my dates. This isn't a date. Well, okay, but uh, aren't you a starving artist? You know, I'm your neighbor. - This is my welcome to the neighbor... - It's okay. - Dinner. - It's okay. Seriously. Dougie, think our boy Frankie here is in love. Oh. Oh, shit, that... I thought it was somethin' important. Seriously, Frankie, are you in love with this Sarah girl? Frankie, don't answer these guys, okay? What? What's wrong? Because Frankie is sweet and I don't want you guys making fun of him for being in love and shit like that. Frankie is my boy. Right, Frankie, you my boy? Yeah, you're my boy. Am I anybody's boy? - No! - No! Ladies, welcome to stage combat class. Now, it's very important for you to remember two universal rules to guarantee safety at all times during a stage performance. Rule number 1 is to always, always, always make eye contact with the person that you're working with. Rule number 2 is always make sure that there's more than adequate distance between you and the actual target that you're aiming at to avoid accidental contact. Do I make myself clear? Eye contact. Eye contact. - Eye contact. - I wanna slap you in the face right now. Eye contact. Ow! Okay, remember eye contact, safe distance - from... - Oh. It's so soft. Okay, I'd think twice, like did you... "Fie! Fie! Fie! Sword and shield, in bloody field, doth win immortal fame. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds." Josette, what say you? "Love looks not with the eyes, But with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind," A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act I, Scene I. "All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts," As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII. "Doubt thou the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love." Hamlet, Act II, Scene II. "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date." Sonnet 18. I thank thee, fair and gentle, Sarah. So how long have you lived here? Seems like forever and a day. I came here with a dream in my head, and stars in my eyes, and I was gonna be the next... You fill in the blank, the next big something. Show business? I was a singer, dancer, actress, comedienne, but mostly I was a waitress. And then I met my first husband. It happened he was someone else's husband at the same time and he swept me off my feet and I never had to work another day in my life. So what was New York like back then? I've heard so much about it from my grandpa. Oh, better in some ways and worse in others. Just like everything else in life. The polo grounds, the old Penn Station, the uh,... ...Fillmore East, the Bellmore Cafeteria, the Rivoli Theaters, they're all gone. Here, I'm gonna show you something? Hey, could you recommend a decent laundry service? So how about you and Frankie? Me and Frankie? Um... Don't worry, intra-apartment dating is not forbidden. No, uh, I mean he's nice I guess, but we're not dating. I didn't come to Manhattan to find a husband. Who said anything about a husband? Look. Look at that. Do you recognize that handsome face? Grandpa. That is definitely my grandpa. Sure is. Oh, I miss him. Oh. Hello. I got you a meeting today with Troy Remy today at 9:00. Wait, 9:00? Shit, that's like right now. 9:00 p.m. Oh, tonight? Mmhmm, it's at the loft we were at the other night. Get there early and uh, oh, wear something hot. Hot. Got ya. Fucking hot. I don't think I have anything that's fuckin' hot. Then get something fucking hot. Jesus Christ, Oh, what the fuck is in this? Jesus Christ. Grandpa? What are you doing here? I came to see you. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to surprise you, honey. Oh. You're looking great. Oh, it so, so good to see you, grandpa. Helena's gonna be really excited, too. - Come on. - Thank you. - Let's go in. - Thank you, honey. Yeah, honey, you seem to be taking well to this city, you know? Yeah, I've made some cool friends and I'm starting to really feel like I'm part - of the fabric, you know? - Uh, well. Maybe I'll take grandma down here for a long weekend. Just take her to s... a musical or these things. That would be awesome. She would love that. Get tickets to The Producers, please. Well, that's going to be tough, grandpa. The Producers closed years ago. - That all I know about Broadway. - Just a sec. Where are you goin' now? And I made you some of my famous split pea soup. - Oh. - Thank you. I must be dreaming. You haven't changed a bit. You always were a great liar. Seeing my granddaughter made my day and you're icing on top of the cake, honey. Oh, flattery will get you everywhere. Oh, thank you. So how long has it been since you guys have seen each other? It was sometime in the '70s. Nixon was President I think. Abe Lincoln I think. Stop it. It was 1972. I remember because I was marching in the anti-war protest that day and you took me to dinner in Little Italy that night. Right, I remember. Sh... she represented every lost cause in the planet. How is your wife? She's great, thank you. She must be an amazing woman. She is to take care of me. How about I take you two out for a bite to eat, okay? See if my favorite restaurant's still open. - Oops. - Ruggiero's. I'm sorry, grandpa. I uh, I've got a thing tonight, I should really start getting ready. Helena, how about you, honey? I... I have got something, too. I think I should go. That's great, you both blowin' me off. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Thank you for taking care of my kid. One thing I know is chemistry. Kinetic chemistry. Whether in cinema or in real life. It's chemistry. I like our energy. I like you. Um, s... s... so um, are you doing any new movie soon? I'm shooting five new movies soon, just like Fassbinder did. 40 movies in 13 years. I just keep goin', I can't stop. Cinema is like a drug to me. You're like a drug to me. Um. Uh, uh, what's your next movie about? It's about everything. It's about this beautiful girl. And she's hot, she's sexy, and she's very pretty. You know what I mean, right? Yeah. And her smile. Wow, her smile was made for the big screen. And her eyes, they're sultry, smoky,... ...so sexy. Her eyes, they are so deep. Deeper than any ocean. Atlantic, Pacific, Indian. So deep, you just get lost in them. Do... do you have a headache? No. This... it's just something to take the edge off. Trust me. It's really good. Hi. Sarah, hi. Troy, hi. I wanna apologize for running out on you this morning. I had an early meeting with some money guys who are in town just for today. I couldn't blow them off. Yeah. Um, yeah, no, I... I understand. You okay? Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Anyway, I'm free right now and I just wanted to say hi. And I wanna drop off your wallet. I don't know if you know, but you left it at my place. Oh shit, my wallet? Fuck. Shit, I had no idea I'd lost it. No worries, I've been there. I'll swing by in an hour, okay? Um. So how was your meeting today? It went great. These people, they got more money than God and they're big fans of my work. Awesome. That's really cool. Yeah, yeah it is. I know this sounds lame, but I texted my mom in Detroit this morning and I told her all about you. Seriously? Seriously. Wow. I know. That's heavy. Yeah, moms are heavy. Anyway, I just wanna keep seeing you. I wanna know if that's possible. Um, sure. Um, we can keep hanging out and uh, I'd love to work with you on a film. Are you seein' anyone right now? Uh, not really. Sarah, all I'm asking for is your time. Uh. You had a great time last night, too, right? I don't really remember a lot from last night. Trust me, it was a good. It was all good. - Shit. - Convention Center. I am off the duty. Come on! Javits Convention Center. Javits Convention Center. Yeah, I hear you first time, okay? There nothing wrong with my hearing, but there is something wrong with your hearing. I am off the duty. I am taking a break. Maybe this will get you back on the duty. You are stupid. I don't need your money. I am trying to eat my lunch and take a break. Take the Uber, mister, the Uber, okay? - Oh yeah? - Yes. Oh yes. Maybe the taxi commission would like to know that you won't take me to the freakin' Convention Center. You see this, fuck stick, okay? NYPD. How would you like to go to the Ass Bangers Convention on Rikers Island? Now, get the fuck out. Alright. Get the fuck out of here. Douche bag. Fuckin' idiot. You're going there, really? I'm going there really. You've already gone there. I've already gone there. Yeah, I've already gone there. I am really going there. You're really going there. I'm already here. You're already here. Bravo. Oh my God. Oh, beautiful, beautiful. Hey. Hey, hey, unintelligent talking. Quiet. That was beautiful, Luna. Beautiful! You know, Meisner would be proud. Thanks, Barry. You're very welcome. Philip. I didn't believe you for two seconds, let alone one. Thanks, Barry. Yeah. I heard Starbucks is hiring. Sarah, front and center. Take off your clothes. I beg your pardon? Take the cotton balls out of your ears and take off your clothes. Um, Barry... uh, Mr.Homburg. Do you call yourself an actress? Yes. Show us you're an actress. Take off your clothes and show us your instrument. - Um, Barry, I... I... I really don't... - Excuse me. How could you be a real actress if you can't get naked in front of the world? Um, I... I... I don't know. Look if you're an actress, you can't be afraid ugh, to express naked emotions, yeah, the... the naked body, the naked truth. So take off your fucking clothes right now! Barry, please. Hey, hey, don't... don't look... Don't look at them, look at me. Over here. Right here. Now, Josie took off her clothes in class, didn't you, Josie? It was uh, liberating? Yeah, it was liberating, see? And so did Jasmine. Didn't you, Jasmine? I have an amazing bod. Just back off, asshole! What did you just say to me? There are plenty of girls at this school who don't seem to mind you brow-beating them into getting naked for you, but Sarah is not one of them. I understand. Both of you, get the fuck out of my class, right now. You fucking babies, both of you. You know something, Barry Homburg? Yeah, a lot more than you do, you little prick. Yeah, I know this, you've been teaching here too long. Oh yeah? Didn't you start out to be an actor or a director, but it didn't work out for you, did it? So you can't stand the fact that you're a fucking failure, bitch! Hey, fuck you and get the fuck out of my class! Come on, Sarah. - Let's blow this popsicle stand. - Thank you. And don't expect to be asked back for second year! I'll tell you that right the fuck now! The cops are gonna love hearing about all the underage kids here you ply with booze, and weed, and blow, Barry. Get out! Hear up! Vice squad. Vice squad, baby! Vice squad, my ass. Bring 'em on! Bring on the cops. I don't give a shit. What am I doin'? I'm only fuckin' teaching how to be free. Free in this class, right? You guys know what I'm talkin' about, right? That guy is not gonna amount to a fucking thing. You see that? If he acts like this here, imagine what he's doin' outside. His fuckin' father threw him out of his house, I'm... I bet you any money. I... I want the truth out of everyone, okay? That guy is not gonna give you the truth. You are... what you're gonna give me is the truth, right? Jasmine, take off your clothes again. Whatever, Barry. Huh. Excuse me, is uh, this seat taken? It's all yours. Thanks. Hey, guys. What can I get you tonight? Um... That apple martini looks pretty good. An apple a day keeps somebody away. It's... it's the doctor. That's good advice. Yeah. Can I get you another? You can get me another one. Alright, alright, another one. Two apple martinis, please. With extra apples. With extra apples! So what's a babe like you doin' in a place like this? You come here often? What's my sign? No, no. What's your sign? That's the best pick up line I've heard all night. Guys. - You. - Mm, mm, yum. - Thank you. - Yeah, enjoy. Mmm. Okay. Hmm, hmm. I beat ya. Excuse me, I gotta take this call. It's my mom. - You're excused. - Don't go anywhere. Where am I gonna go? The movies? - Hey. - Hey. Sorry to interrupt. Um, I couldn't help but overhear what you said about the movies. Um, there's actually a good foreign film playin' over at the Film Forum. - Uh, Les Bonnes Femme. - Les Bonnes Femm. Oh, French fries sound so good. You want... you want some fries? - I can order some? - Yeah, yeah. - They're good here. - French fries with a side of apple martini. Mm... Hey buddy, I was sitting there. Calm down, okay? I'm just having a chat with the nice lady. Yeah, I noticed. Hey, don't be a fuckin' hypocrite, okay? I've been watching you. You've been watching me? What are you some kinda creep? Look, I saw her first. She's been getting hammered for the past three hours. Les Bonnes Femm. Les Bonnes Femm. Oh my God! Oh God, I'm never drinking again. - Never? - Never. - Your birthday? - No. - New Year's? - No. - Your wedding? - I'm never getting married. Oh shit. Work. Mmhmm. - Hmm, see ya later. - Sure. - If you're lucky. - Bye. Hello, there. Nice weather, huh? No? Something I said? Where are you going? Hey, I wanna talk to you. Can you please slow down? Hello? Ms. Quintana! Ms. Quintana, can you stop moving? Excuse me? No, excuse me. Do we know each other? Kind of a one-way street. You don't know me, I know you. Well, I know about you. I have friends on the NYPD, I'm calling the police. I am the police. I am the NYPD. You and I, we need to talk. Here's my card. I want you to call me today. Actually, I want you to come and see me today. Are we clear? Look, it's a victimless crime. Dealing drugs and homicide are victimless crimes. Drugs? Homicide? What do y... what do you mean? I mean I'm talking about Troy Remy. Troy? What are you talking about? I am talking about Troy fucking Remy. You know him? Yeah. Sorry, uh, I don't know anything about this. Why don't you stop and taken off your sunglasses? Why? 'Cause it's impolite and stupid to wear sunglasses in a closed building. Well, I don't wanna get arrested for being impolite. Or stupid. Oh, that's lovely. Did he do that to you? Who? Your boy, Troy. Uh, no. Sarah, why don't I believe you? That's your issue, not mine. Well, it's gonna be your issue, too, if you don't tell me. You wanna stay out of trouble, don't you? Yes. Then talk to me. Do I need a lawyer? I don't know, Sarah, do you? Look, Troy is a hot film director, okay? He doesn't need to sell drugs. Did you see The Fault Within? Uh, no, and neither did anybody else. I mean, all told, his films maybe grossed about 37 bucks. He earns his money from dealing drugs. That's how he affords that swanky loft of his. Can you just get to the point? Do you know he has five ODs under his belt? Only two of the girls survived. What is it you'd like me to write on your tombstone? "I should have listened to Detective Belson when I had the chance." I know guys like this prick. I have a daughter your age. And she is just as snarky and know-it-all like you. Now, why don't you let me help you? Move in with me. Huh? Move in with me. Be my old lady. Your old lady? It's just an expression. Move in with me. We can make lots of movies together. Be my muse like Dietrich and Sternberg, Tippi and Hitchcock. I'll even act. Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer! Isn't it too soon? There is no too soon. There are either right vibes and wrong vibes. These vibes are right. When you know, you know. And I know. I am not moving in with him. - Sarah. - What? - Well, then just leave. - That's it? - Well... - Well, what? If you leave now, can you live with yourself knowin' that animal is peddling pills to kids? I still don't think that's true. Oh, it's true. This scumbag has taken advantage of young girls just like yourself and you could live with that? - Habla Español, Señorita Quintana? - Not really. - Si o no? - No. You didn't speak Spanish at home? Is this your attempt at good cop, bad cop? What do you think this is? Television? Honey, this is not a TV show. And you're in a real quandary, because you have to help yourself and you have help us. So what are you gonna do? The bottom line, I want Troy Remy and you're gonna be the one to help us! So do what you must do. I'm not moving in with him. You better listen to what he's tellin' you if you know what's good for you. Then don't move in with him. Be his girl. Get close to him. Get some intel. Help us and help yourself. Am I clear? Sarah, just remember one thing, at the end of the day, they all just wanna fuck you. They wanna fuck you any which way they can. They all wanted to fuck me and they all wanna fuck you. That's why you're in the world to get fucked. I have big plans, mom. To hell with your big plans. You don't mean anything to any of them. Who's she? I don't know. Maybe it's you. Maybe it's future you. Is she dead? Maybe. Why did you leave? Hey. What are you doing here? I have class. You are ducking me and I need info. Here I am. Fine. Right, they're cops. Well, retired cops, but once a badge, always a badge. That's correct. What else? They're super creepy, kinda eccentric. I almost think they might be a couple. A couple of what? A couple. You know like, a couple couple? Interesting. But they're not. They're not interesting or they're not a couple? Both. No, I mean, neither. Okay. And you take money back and forth to this warehouse? Correct. And these two clowns are always at the warehouse? Yes. Okay, I'll look into that. No. - Excuse me? - No, this is the trade-off, okay? I gave you this and I'm no longer your rat. I want Troy and you'll do what I ask you to do. How's that? This is bigger than Troy. Oh, really? Little girl telling me my business. Look, I'm walking either way, okay? I didn't do anything wrong. How about six to eight years just for carryin' that money? I'd be out in 30 months. And you're willing to do 30 months? It beats hangin' out with Troy. Just do your fucking job, alright? It's not my job to tell you how to do your fucking job. Cops are touting their bust up of a $50-million counterfeit goods ring. Hours ago, they raided a warehouse here on Manhattan's West Side. The loot: fake Gucci bags, fake North Face jackets, fake Beats by Dre headphones. Who the hell told me to go into business with you? I know I was gonna get locked up eventually, fucking great idea. I'm goin' first, fuck you. - Yeah, I dumped her. - What? Are you kidding me? Well, what happened to your delicate flower? She was getting too needy. So just like that? Just like that. I don't get you, kid. Well, let's say no more actresses for me. Flaky self-centered prima donnas, man. I'll remind you that next time you date another one. Yeah, well, I don't... Whoa, wait, Bob, I'll talk to you later. See you at my bar. What? Sarah! Where the fuck you been? What about our movie? Come on, man, this is very unprofessional of you. Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Fuck! Hey, uh, uh, are you my new neighbor? Uh, am I? Well, if you're moving in here, you are. I'm Frankie. - Frankie Li. - Um, Ivy. Ivy Wellman. Enchanté. Huh? Enchanted. You enchant me. I'm enchanted. Oh. Wow. - Me too. - Allow me. Okay, just... yeah, careful with her. So are you new in town or just a change of neighborhood? Uh, I'm new in town. I'm a singer/songwriter, so you know, New York's the place. Well, thank goodness. I thought you would be an actress or something. There's too many of those around New York already. Oh, really? Under every rock. So what are you like uh, Taylor Swift? Um, more like Bob Dylan. He started here, so it's good enough for me. Oh, Dylan. The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest? That's right, that's a great song. Well, right this way, Ivy Wellman. Okay. Hey, by the way, what apartment you're in? Uh, 7B. We are neighbors then. I'm in 7C! Oh, how about that! You need help with your bag? No, no, that's okay. Thank you. Hey, you have plans for dinner tonight? Um, no, I don't, but that would be great, because I haven't had a chance to pick up any groceries yet. Great. And it's on me, of course. I made a killing on Bitcoins. Wow, even better. You are such a sweetheart, Frankie Li! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, and can you recommend a good laundry service around here? Why you ask? Because I'm Chinese? Oh, no, no. I'm... I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean that. Um, sorry. Just kidding. I know a place and they deliver. Okay. Who the fuck are you? No, don't worry, don't worry. You left your keys in the door, that's all. I was visiting my girlfriend down the hall, I saw the keys in the door. I knocked, but you didn't answer. So I thought something was wrong. I was getting ready to call the police. No, don't worry. You know and you shouldn't leave your keys in the door. A girl can't be too careful these days in the city. Don't worry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. The choice between hell and happiness, Sarah, is entirely yours. Don't share yourself with those that don't have your interests at heart. Everything you make has consequences, so develop a sense of caution. Save yourself from the pain that devours your spirit and destroys your soul. But how? How do I do that? Don't take it anymore. You are a warrior.
