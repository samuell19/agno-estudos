'The Long, Cold, Beach' Did we bring the ketchup? You always buy lots of pointless things, and the things we really need... Here it is! So the doctor says; "Do you know what the definition of instant is?" The definition of instant is the time that passes when the lights turn green... And that idiot behind you sounds his horn. You've heard it before? -No. For once, Jane, what fun is there in always doing the same things. I didn't say anything, Harry. You're so quiet. -No... It's just that I told the Kleins' we might go skiing... And they might be expecting us. -Tell them we changed our mind. We'll be alone for a while, Jane. It's always empty in this season. Won't that be fun. Look, Jane. Look at the view. It's going to rain. We've arrived. It's a bit chilly. Now, I'll cook you something... You won't believe! I also brought that sauce you like so much. Can you take care of the rest? Fry for three minutes, then add three teaspoons. One. Two. And three. Doesn't that smell nice. It's got onions in it. Now, some ketchup. Go on, try it. Is it good? Fantastic. Modestly, when I cook... You know I'm also famous for my cooking at the bank. You remember the trip last year... That frozen spaghetti was as soft as cream. The deputy manager told me... Good, Harry, aside from a beautiful wife you also have other hidden talents. Listen, I'm going to sleep, if there's a bed. There you go. It's been like that... Since the dawn of creation. I forgot my pyjamas. -You won't need them tonight. Your hands are cold. I'm tired. -We can sleep all day. I don't want to, Harry. I don't want to. You need sustenance to enjoy the primitive life. If there was a heater, at least. You know, dear, I used to fish here in the Summer... And it was always hot then. You have your fur coat. Did you put on a jumper? Then what's underneath your coat? -My rage. This is great, it's so peaceful. Nobody around to bother you, this is a weekend. What's the point going to those places... In the same hotel, with the same friends, telling you the same things. Nobody listens. -What do you mean nobody listens? But it's you who wants to go. Well, maybe I do. It can also be nice, spending a weekend like that. A man and a woman, alone. Well, you're the woman, and I'm the man. Cigarette? Cigarette? It's cold, right, guys? What do you want? You know, we were just leaving, our friends are waiting for us. Jane. Go and get ready. If you need help... Don't do anything foolish, guys. Everyone likes nice things. You know, I just want to watch. -I'm not in the mood. Don't take too long. Who knows how many other people she's slept with. At least she can use rape as an excuse this time. Dirty bastard. Do you want to kill him, idiot? Don't come any closer. Everything is better with Coca-Cola. Who is that guy? -That's none of your business. Does he make you happy? -Yes, yes! Liar. Just like all the rest. Don't you want to make love with me? -Animals don't make love, they just mate. You're right, it's not love, it's just mounting. She doesn't even scream. She could at least preserve her dignity Stay down, you're better off. Stop. Go away. Please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Go away. Go away. Please. Pray to God, if you believe. He made us, didn't he? The devil made you, with your whore mother! Imbecile. He's taking his time. He's probably trying to get her to cooperate. Just because you stood in front of a priest with her... You think you have more right than us? I love her. Then go on, kill us! You're enjoying it, just like us. Whoever wins goes up first. Shit. It's your turn. If you want go first? -You won, right? Can I watch? You know, I don't like people watching. Is it small? You liked it as well. -That why I hate you more. We're just this, this, this! If this says it's okay, it's okay. What's your name? Fred. I'm Jane. Haven't you finished? They're animals. Like you. Who's next? Finally. Pig. Are you waiting for her to cool down? You go. Keep an eye on the blonde. Wait. You don't mind if I watch, do you? Thomas went up. It was my turn. Hurting someone like that, it's too easy. What's bad for you is good for someone else. What's wrong, hombre? That's not what you used to think. Once, we were Beat, then Hippies... You know what we are now? Vagabonds. -Who cares... ...about what we are? I like living like this, free from everything... Without violence. That's also too easy. We're animals... But with something inside us that takes away the pleasure of being one. I like watching the sea. That wave will always be the same, before us, and after... From the first floods, to the end of the world. He wants to watch as well. Too late, my friend. But there will be a repeat performance. Stop fooling around. Jane. Is there any beer? Are you trying to scare him? Jane, let's get out of here. I couldn't do anything, they tied me up. We must thank God if we're still alive. We are still alive. Where are your things? Get dressed. We have to leave, right now. Why are you looking at me like that? You're happy you're still alive. They might come back, Jane. Please. I'm begging you. Go away. And leave my wife alone. Get in. Damn it. It's not starting. What are you afraid of? They got what they came for. Hooligans. Thugs. They'll kill us if they come back. -Coward. What should I have done? Let them kill me. Take it. Now he's the one who should be afraid. Don't worry, beautiful... We'll take care of you later. Who fired? He stunned me. That bastard... He shot me in my face. If he hadn't been so scared, he'd have killed me. So they had a pistol. Not bad. Give me that pistol, Thomas. You know I don't like orders. I'd have stayed with my father. Give it to me. What's mine belongs to everyone, Okay, guys, we have a pistol. We've been here too long, let's grab our bikes and get out of here. Yes, he's right. -I'm not finished yet. You don't meet women like her every day, right, Fred? They're all the same. We'll have another round with her, then we'll go. But this time you'll let me watch. Wait. We decided, didn't we? Democratically! Why are you going back? Come on, let's go. She didn't satisfy me, it was like making love to a corpse. Those pigs must have split. Get up. -No, it's pointless. It's pointless. They're here. Don't stop, Jane. Don't stop. They'll get us anyway. I told you to get up. I can't go on. Run, if you want, they won't look for you. If they were coming here to kill you you'd run a mile... But they're not coming here to kill you... You know they're not coming here to kill you. Leave me here, Harry. Leave me here. Why won't you admit that you enjoyed making love to those animals? That's what you're afraid of, isn't it? Because I'm just a thing to you, something you use for your pleasure. Are you afraid I can also feel pleasure? You talk like a whore. Jane, I'm begging you, let's hide. It's no use, Harry. It's no use. Jane... I love you. I love you. Get on. Hold on tight. That animal has already started. Hey, Jonathan, leave him to it. Leave him to it. Leave him to it. Come on, Thomas, let me get you a nice beer. What are you waiting for? Your friend is much quicker. For the first time, I hated all of them... And I don't want it to happen again. -Do you want me to apologise? It's the only way you can have a woman, with force! Yes, Jane, I know. For God's sake, this is bullshit. What the hell is he doing to her? He never takes more than ten minutes. Look at him. We gave him a hiding. Now we're taking care of his wife. What does he have to laugh about? Before, it was rape... Something like a storm, or a hailstorm. But now... Now you're the stupid ones. No one's being raped upstairs any more... Jane and your friend know. -Shut up, you imbecile. Come on, Thomas, don't listen to him. He's trying to pit us against each other. There were four of you, and one of me... It was easy. Like cowards... Now there are only three of you. But you're here, just like me, waiting. Let's get some rest. If Fred has her all night, then we'll have her all day. Yes. Anyway... There's nothing left to eat. Okay. But Fred's going to pay for this. You're going? Then you're worse than me... You're scared! Take him with you. Take him with you. Take him with you! Don't fight back. You're in a gas chamber. Let him go. Listen, hero, why don't you ask him to leave? We don't give a shit about your wife. It didn't work out. Perhaps this is love, Fred. Something you find without looking for it. For me, love is being friends. But it's hard to be friends with a woman. Me and Harry have been married for five years... We always did everything together, we ate together, slept together... Holidays together... And I was faithful, him as well, I think. But I know, I've always known that I don't love him. And he knows he doesn't love me. We're all like that. We pretend we believe one another. The earth seems empty today. Clean. How old are you? I'm very old, we're all very old. We've all been here since the world started. Why do you live like this? You're not like your friends. I'm like them, like all the others. With one difference, we show you what we are... Without shame. I'm not ashamed, either. Now. But tomorrow, next week... Next month... You'll be ashamed of this. You're awake. We waited all night. -Right. Did you take her? -No, not me. Where's Thomas? -Around. Help me. Let go of me. Coward. Let go of me! Why is the other one okay, but this one isn't? What are you trying to prove, Thomas? -That I've had enough of you! Out of the way. Put that thing away. We know what to do if there's a problem. Okay, come outside so I can break your jaw. It couldn't have been any worse, Harry. But you knew it was going to happen. The discussion is over. Come home, Jane. Those bastards have taken everything. You haven't eaten since yesterday. You know, Jane... Once, when I was twenty years old, I ran away from home... I lived like them for a summer. For as long as the illusion that I could change the world lasted... It was good. But, then... They lost that illusion a long time ago. Come on, you have to eat something. Listen... Then we'll leave, okay? Then we'll leave, Fred. We'll get out of here. Go away. Let him in. Kill us both. If you don't kill us you'll spend the next twenty years in jail. If anyone else comes I really will kill you. Take it and leave. Was it their decision? -It was my decision. Go. I'm the one who should be scared, not you. You'll be long gone by nightfall. He's the one who'll get you in trouble... He'll take off with Jane, and he'll leave you in it. Fred would never betray us. Let's go. What happened? Finished already? What happened? Why were you so quick? Will you leave me alone? Did you pay her a visit? Fred's smitten, he doesn't want to share her with us. He told me this is the last time. -The last time for us! You know what Fred did? -No. He gave them back the engine part. -It's not true. I'm telling you it's gone. With the car, they'll stop at the first police station... And we'll be screwed. That's what that son of a bitch wants, he's working with her. You're the son of a bitch. -Are you with us or with him? You messed up, Fred, now I'm involved. I didn't expect it from you. But now you have to pay. Why don't you give us one of your speeches about friendship, bastard? You mustn't have anything if you want to be free. Share everything, right? Why are you so upset, Thomas? Because you're a dirty traitor. Ready to sell us out... ...for some broad. Enough. I said that's enough. We followed you for years with your wise words... And now you've had enough. What do you want now? Slippers? Your little wife in heat on Saturdays so you can fill her with you blessed seeds? But we're here. Us, Fred. Us! Your friends, your brothers. Your lovers. Bastard. Shit. Shit. They're fighting amongst themselves. You're not in love with him, are you? Poor Harry. If we make it out of here, this will just seem like a nightmare... Absurd, unbelievable. For you as well. You'll look at yourself in the mirror and you'll ask yourself how was it possible? And I'll go shopping, with Mary, Sandy, June... And with June, Sandy, Mary, I'll buy lots of stupid pointless things... Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... And, on Friday night, we'll go away for the weekend... And on Saturday and Sunday we'll make love for five minutes. It's horrible when you say it like that... But it's the only thing we have left. The only thing we can hold on to, to stop us going crazy... Like them outside. No, Harry, I'm already crazy. Since when? Since when? Since forever. I wanted to come here, me! Take your freedom, it's the piece you were missing... Puppet. Robot. I'll call you when the car's ready. He's gone. Fred's gone. You went too far. And maybe the sea... Smoke. This will clear your head. I met Fred ten years ago... I had been riding with him for a year... When we met you and Jonathan. He was well dressed at the time... And I didn't want to lend him a piece of the pavement to sleep on. "You've got money." I told him... "Why don't you go to a hotel?" You know what he did... He emptied his pockets... He smiled at me, and he gave me everything he had. "Now you go to the hotel.", he told me. And all his chatter. Shit. How do we live? Off the things other people throw away. Or whatever we can steal from some idiot. Society is sick. Sure. But why limit yourself to living outside of it. Society is sick and we're the virus. We have to aim higher. It's all ours. You like something? You take it. If you don't like someone... You kill him. You have to attack the system from within... And we have to be the virus. I like living like this, without anything... But without problems. I... I don't want to hit anyone... Or attack anyone. To be free. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. And viruses... I've never understood what the hell they are. Never. You're like Fred... You're a dirty, stinking, little... What did they do to you? What did they do to you? Let's throw him out, they'll leave us alone if they have him. Or I can finish him off, if you like? -Stop it You don't think I'm capable of killing him, right? You know it's not hard to be a criminal. Come upstairs. You can do it, I'll help you. Why did you give it to me? They might come looking for him. -Fine, then they'll find him. Leave him where he is. They won't come looking for us if we leave now. I hope they slaughter all those damned cowards. That they slaughter them. All of them. Because he's the coward, Jane. Him! That's why he formed a gang. Like the apes did a million years ago. Nothing's broken. He's right. He's right. Don't speak. -I don't want to be alone. Don't speak. Your mouth is bleeding. I'm one of them, I'm nothing without...! Did you let them attack you because of me? They thought I wanted to leave them. And it's not true? Fred, if you love me. Love is an invention. You saw how it was. Nobody invented it. What you call love, only exists in our world. Chinese, Indians, they don't even know what we're trying to say... When we talk about our love. We'll go away. You and me. In a tent, if you want. It's them. We'll be together, forever. I'll divorce Harry, I've never really been his. Forever. I've never been his. I bet you vote Republican. Fred, I'm serious. Silent America. -Are you a Communist? 'Dead souls from the stone ass, seated half way across the world' You know who wrote that? Me. It's me... A man without faith, without philosophy... Someone who walks up and down the earth. They're coming. They can't wait any longer. They know I'm here. Maybe they've decided to leave us alone. No... They can't live without me. They beat you half to death, and if they come here, they'll kill you. I don't understand some of the things you say... Because the world isn't how you describe it. And you won't change it, going around like a vagabond. They're scared. They're scared because I have the pistol. They won't come tonight. You're not well. I'll talk to them tomorrow. I'll tell them it's over. We'll go our separate ways. And this woman, I'll tell them... This woman is mine. And you have to be. They've gone. Fred, they've gone. We're free. They've gone. I'm coming with you, it will be just like before. I'm coming with you. With you. Turn off your engines. Nothing's happened. I'm coming with you. Wait for me. Stop. Listen. Listen to me. Listen to me. Stop. Stop. Wake up. Wake up. I might even get to the office on time.
