Still the mouth is shut How should I say that I like my darling? The heart's agreed The heart remained silent. It danced steadily The secret was revealed, while the eyes spoke I don't know at which moment our eyes met It was very difficult The heart's agreed. Still the mouth is shut How should I say that I like my darling? The heart's agreed The eyesight slipped somewhere today such that... lightning struck my nerves The arrows of eyesight shot. New desires emerged Now I can't concentrate on anything The heart's agreed. Still the mouth is shut How should I say that I like my darling? The heart's agreed I said, slowly. You're very bad. Hey Basanti... sometime ask me properly, what it is I want. See. If you say anything wrong then I'll abuse you. This will increase my love all the more. Go drown yourself in a handful of water. These days are not of dying. We've just entered our youth. May your youth catch fire. All the time you block my path. Shameless. At least I'm better than that blind one of yours. You're hoping for more than what you deserve. Hey, you're not worth the dust under his feet. Move aside. Remember Basanti. Don't forget... the astrologers say you'll marry a sighted man. Not a blind man. Understood? - Oh God! - Long live the amputated leg. May you be destroyed. You're useless. Uncle, money order. Oh, come, boss. Long live the amputated leg. Boss, our Government's so true and loyal... that every month sitting at home, the money comes. Long live the amputated leg. - Long live the amputated leg. Long live the amputated leg? - Father, you got the money? - Yes, see. Give me my share. Take your share. And this... Basanti. - Sister's very angry. - She is? Fine, take this. Her share. Put it in her marriage box. Quiet. Quiet. We've come to serve you. And we'll do that. But quiet. Can you keep quiet and tell us what this is? Very good. Recognised well. Now in the same way, recognise us too. Someone's said that. The arrows from the eyes hit hard. So brothers, he can be safe. But the one beaten by wealth, dies saying about wealth... "Hey stranger from a faraway place, take me along." Friends, this piece of paper... is the ticket for the Iranian lottery. Shortage of wealth. Problems of the money lender. Household disputes. All over. Similarly... the way in which clothes go to a washerman to get cleaned. Hey you, stand on your feet. What I mean is... you're standing quietly. I'm sure there's something. This is the first meeting. But, in the first meeting I'll make you a millionaire. You ask how? Friends. One last wicket with a ticket. It has wonders... that the blind, lame, anyone can win it. This isn't an army entrance... where a healthy person is required. These city people think that we villagers are stupid. Long live the amputated leg. Come Raja. - At least listen to what I'm saying. - Go away. You've come to turn others into millionaires. First become one yourself. Come on. Kalua come home. Come Lanu. Everyone go home. Hey. At least let me finish. Listen brothers. Why're you leaving your profits? - Wow, God. - Yes. I didn't call you. I'm talking to God above. Collect our stuff. Come. My throat's gone sore from shouting. But, not one understood. Excuse me. May I get some water? - Will you drink water? - Yes, water. Today, don't know whose face I saw shouting. I am sorry. My throat's sore from shouting. But not a single ticket was sold. - All over a ticket? - Yes. - Then I'll take it. - Very good. How much? Only Rs.7 and 50 paise. You'll rid yourself of problems and become a millionaaire. Drink some water. I don't aspire to be one. No? Won't you take a ticket? I will. You wait here. I'll be right back. I won't move from here. - Mr. Parker, he's blind. - That's the reason why he's caught. Hey, who are you? Me? - Just the name or the whole address? - Shut up. You won't be able to cheat me. Got it? Understood. That person's very strict. Chandan. What are you doing? Buying a ticket. Don't listen to them. They're just crooks. - Let it be. - They look very bad and dishonest. How will they build palaces by being dishonest? It's only Rs. 7 and 50 paise. Why should we get cheated? What'll you do on buying the ticket? Nothing. Just, a memory of these people. Oh ho. Why don't you understand? Don't buy the ticket. I understand everything, Basanti. The thing is... these people have come to our village from the city. Nothing else. The dignity of our village will be retained. - Take this, brother. - Very good. Count it. Three. Two. Five. Six, seven. Seven and a quarter. 25 annas are missing. - Doesn't matter. Will do. - Very good. Only you are an intelligent person. The rest of the village is blind. - Your good name? - Chandan. Chandan? Wow. Chandan London. Will remain in the memory even after me. Here, am giving the ticket. Keep it properly. It's very important. It'll be useful to you in the future. At times, people don't help other people, brother. This is just a piece of paper. She left happily. Yes. So today's world functions on paper, brother. I say, if things don't change, then even humans... will be made of paper in the future. - = Very good. - Control. Here's the ticket. Keep it properly. Let's go. Or else he'll change his mind. Who knows what'll happen tomorrow. Brothers. One last ticket. This has wonders wherein the blind, lame, anyone can win. Very good. Very good Mr. Parker. This time, a lot of tickets were sold. The thing is boss... the company has increased the prize money so much... that people faint on hearing. Otherwise, just one glance from me will sell the ticket. - What say Mr. Bhagwan? - Very god. Don't glance at me, Mr. Parker. Humans make mistakes. Anyways tell me, what's my share in those green notes? - Yes, yes. - I mean, commission. - After subtracting the company's share, everything else is yours. - Really? - Take this. - Very good. Hey, people control their hearts. Can't you control your mouth? Looks like God forgot to install breaks while sticking his tongue. Must be a mistake. Must have? It's happened. He's going because of me. Otherwise he's useless. All right, I'll leave. - Thank you very much. - Okay. Come, let's go. - Mr. Parker? - What is it? - Mine? - What mine? - Commission. Say so. Why are you going around in circles? Take, this is the family matter. - Less or more. Put it by your heart. - Fare? Take some from your pocket and take some from me. Clear his payments, too. - All right, I'll go. - Where? - To Leela. - Leela? Return my heart, you Englishman. God forbid First you give your heart... then you take it back. What are you? Return my heart, you Englishman. God forbid I am one colorful butterfly. I never sit, here I go I don't have a single destination. I shine like lightning I shine like lightning Return my heart you Englishman. God forbid First you give your heart... then you take it back. What are you? Sometimes you stand closer and dance Sometimes you're scared of love Sometimes you're a flower, sometimes a thorn I've never understood your secret Return my heart you Englishman. God forbid First you give your heart... then you take it back. What are you? Don't look at me like this. My yawn's broken Stop following me. I'm fed up with your love I'm fed up of your love Return my heart you Englishman. God forbid First you give your heart... then you take it back. What are you? Where're you going? From the time I've fallen in love with you, it's like a disease. Where were you the last month and 6 days? That lottery thing. Darling, even if a single ticket wins... then the whole world will be at our feet. Smile a bit. What's the matter? Why has this rose turned into a cauliflower? I'm very worried Parker. I haven't paid rent for 6 months. The landlord must be at the door now. Oh ho. What's there to be scared? Come to my bungalow. As it is, I've haven't paid rent for six years. But, he doesn't dare say anything. Such is my status. Milkman, landlord, watchman, all come to salute me. Slip out on the promised date. Understood? All right, then come fast. - All right, I'll change. - Okay. Very good. - You're back? - Yes. The earlier bill of Rs. 120 is pending. Daily you eat, drink and slip away. Aren't you ashamed? Both of us are shameless in this regard. I mean, we both have the same fault. I don't pay for the food and drinks. You don't pay for the dancing and singing. - Six months salary is unpaid. - Quiet! Guard. Waiter. Throw him out. I am a bit shameless about leaving. - I'll show myself out. - You! It's just a room. But it can be compared with the biggest bungalow. What's special about it is... that the bathroom, dining room, hall, kitchen, everything is in one room. Move aside. Come. Hey chap. What're you doing? I'm from the bar. I've come to collect my Rs. 4 and 50 paise. That scoundrel keeps everyone's bills pending? That son of a dog told me he manages a mill. Will you people wait here or go? Where will I go? I'm sitting here. I'll sleep here tonight, or else my boss will beat me. - Will you wait, too? - Yes, I'll sit here. Hey, where are you going? Can't you see? Usually there's just one messenger of death. But for me, five of them are waiting. Wow. What a bunglow. Few people staying. And too many caretakers. Now, how did I know they must be on guard? Anyway, leave. We'll make some other place our home. There's one thing, Leela. I salute these hands. Until now I've never returned what I've taken. Unnecessarily, I'm stuck in your problems. I'm neither here nor there. Leave all the talk. Where'll you go at night? Anywhere, other than this bungalow of yours. - To some friend. Got it? - Yes. Who helps you in your troubled times? While dying, have you seen the eyes turn around? Which place is nice? It stinks here. Smells like a drain. Here? Yes. It's morning. Come, let's have food. Oh God. Come Lala. You too. That man won't go. You go. Until he shows up... I'll not leave here. I'll catch him properly. Oh God. What trouble have you put me in? That son of a devil. Sleeps peacefully here. And I stay awake for him there. Hey, son of a dog. Hey, manager. - Who's it? - I'll kill you. God's swear, I'll kill you. I've waited here the whole night. - Money! - Yes... I want all my money right now. You check it yourself. - You've money? - Yes. Why did you make me wait the whole night? You should've told me. Rouge, it's all hundreds. My goodness. Madhubala. Geeta Bali. Shyama. This beautiful problem. Wow. Hey manager, what's her name? Hey manager, her name... You idiot, where did you go? While distracting me with the women, where've you gone? Doesn't matter. I shall sit here, too. I'll see how many days you don't show up. Uncle. Hey, come. Son, come. Money order. Month's over and money is in my hands. All right uncle. I'll take the receipt later. Today there's competition on Hanuman hill. - Really? - Long live the amputated leg. Basanti. Hey, Radha. Oh yes. Today there's competition on Hanuman hill. On your cheeks, hey beautiful On your cheeks, hey beautiful, there's a new glow That means, this is a new found love This dark and fragrant hair... who are these snakes waiting to bite?

You'll get your bonus. 13000. 13000? Take it out right away. You'll get your money when you bring that man here. Oh ho. So, I'll have to bring him here? Doesn't matter. Come Bhagwan. - Here I go and come. - Very good. Hey, man... why've you come to our village with these musicians? You villagers have become lucky. Go and tell your boss Chandan... that he's won the lottery. - 4.5 million? - Yes. - My God! - Go. Start. Chandan! - Chandan, you've become a king. - What happened brother?

Sir, where's the ticket? Ticket? Which ticket? The paper from the other day? Not a piece of paper but it's a check for 4.5 million. Get it fast. - I threw it away. - You threw it? Dead. Play the mourning music. Play it. Stop it. Try to remember where you put it. I don't remember anything. If you don't remember... you'll get nothing without the ticket. What? No money? Tell me what it looked like. Father. What happened? The ticket's lost. Did you see it? - I don't know. - No one knows. Someone must know. Otherwise I'll have to bear the losses for the band. Try to remember, sir. It had a picture of a woman. - Woman? -Yes. - I have it. It's there? Where? I stuck it in the window. Really? If it's not there then I'll stick your nose. Very good. Tell me where it is. Should I? Okay, I won't. - Oh, ho. - Tell us. - Should I? - Yes. - No. - Hey, tell it. - Take this one rupee and speak fast. At least now tell me. Okay, I'll tell. Come. Here. Yes. JEE 1429. This is it. - Should I remove it? - Don't touch, it will tear. Bhagwan. Go fast and get the hammer. I'll remove the door. - Very good. - Basanti. Bhagwan. But father... why didn't you take the ticket? You wander around aimlessly the whole day. You've blown all my hard earned money in useless activities. - 4.5 million. - But father, me... Why didn't you take the ticket? Whatever work you do, all suffer losses. Oh 4.5 million! But father, at least listen to me. Why didn't you take the ticket? Since I first heard, my blood's been boiling. I'll kill you. 4.5 million. But father, at least listen to me. Why didn't you take the ticket, you fool? Why didn't you? Rs. 4.5 million. Boss. - Chandan. - We've found the ticket. - Found it? - Yes. Radha mistook it as a picture and pasted it on the window. - Then? - They're cutting the window. Get ready soon. They'll bring you along. Me? Take me along? Yes. Won't you go to get the money? Rs. 4.5 million. But what'll we do with so much money? And then... These people have started addressing me as boss. Don't know what they'll call me in the future. Long live amputated leg. Why're you scared, son? I'll come with you. Don't worry, I'm a soldier. - Get up. Get ready. - But uncle... Enough. I won't listen to anything. Get up now. Rs. 4.5 million. Means, 4 lakh... 50 thousand. Wow, city dwellers. They've made good fun of a blind man. Played music. Who know what they'll do to him after returning to the city? What'll they do? They'll give Rs. 4.5 million And do you know? A palace will be built for me with that money. He'll envy us. - If he doesn't get the money? - May your mouth be filled with ashes. Then this'll happen, that you'll... have to keep company with Banwari tomorrow. Enemies are born, along with money. Big people aside, this poor fellow is at the mercy of God. - Shut up Banwari. - Say what you like, Basanti. Every astrologer says you'll marry a sighted man. - Not a blind man. - Sister... should I cut off his head? It'll come off on its own one day. Come. Come, madam. Come. Meet him. This is our boss, Mr. Chandan. - Hello. - Hello. He's blind, but his heart has big eyes. We're uninvited guests. Please forgive us. On my eyelids. Be at home. Very good. And he my boss, Chandan's uncle. Not only Chandan's, but everyone's. - Hello uncle. - Hey, what're you doing? It is not wrong to touch the feet of elders. And then you're like my father. Bhagwan, you make arrangements for their food. You've ordered so much food... it would have fed my entire village. Why are you embarrassing me, Mr. Chandan? Lord Narayan has come to an aunt's house. I believe as if the procession of joy has come to our house. - Sit. - Oh! Well said, Ms. Leela. All right boss. You take rest. Uncle, you come with me. I'll make first class arrangements for you upstairs. Sleep comfortably in the shadow of stars. Wow. How's it possible? - I won't leave Chandan alone. - Oh ho. But this house is so big, it has a lot of scope. Every person can sleep separately. Not matter the scope... my bedding will be besides Chandan's. I had no objection, but... municipality people sometimes trouble us. Now I don't know the rule. Anyway, doesn't matter. You sleep here. We'll see. Bhagwan. Yes sir. Make sleeping arrangements for him, too, here. Very good. - All right, Mr. Chandan. - All right, Ms. Leela. - Good night. - Bye. - Bye, uncle. - Bye uncle. Bye. Chandan. - I'll arrange it. You go. - Very good. Chandan. I don't find this girl's behavior proper. - Why uncle? - What what? Sometimes she stares at you. Sometimes she holds your hand. Good girls aren't like this. Uncle, this is the city. Maybe this is how city people behave. What, a city rule? Parker, this tall man is very smart. From the time he's come, he's in the same mood. Instead of putting hands on his shoulder, I'll step on his throat. You be strong. Such golden chances won't come again. Whenever it'll happen. But this time you've robbed me. I've arranged this house after selling all my jewelry. Oh ho. Hey, darling. Once the blind man gets paid, then he'll be in our hands. - You see what happens tomorrow. - Very good. Because of me, you're taking so much trouble Ms. Leela. Don't say that, Mr. Chandan. This house has become lively since you arrived. You know very well how to entertain guests. I feel like I should keep speaking with you. Such innocent and sweet talk. Oh ho, what a problem. The money hasn't arrived... and people have begun complaining. - What happened Mr. Parker? - Boss... everybody wants to be related to us. One agent has been troubling us all morning. He even says he's coming. He's sitting outside. What'll he do if he comes along? Just ask for a free commission. And what else? But how do I avoid him? Here's an idea. - What? - I'll tell him to come. You ask why we need him. What'll he do here? - Good. - Come. Carefully. - Come. You come too. - No, why is he required? What'll he do there? Come, boss. Sit. Where's uncle? Uncle? He's eating bread in the kitchen. And fighting with Ms. Leela to make five more. I'll just get him. You sit. Carefully, boss. - Lift your shirt. - Okay. Uncle, if Mr. Chandan doesn't want to take you along, it's his wish. But I won't go without taking you. See, if you aren't there with us, then who'll take care of the money? I've not come to take care of money... but to take care of Chandan, Mr. Parker. But now he doesn't need me. He's capable. He's not yet received the money, but his attitude has already changed. Even I don't like this behaviour of his. But I've told him clearly that I won't go without uncle. That's why am here. Come. - I've said I won't go. - Oh ho. You forgive him. I say that people make mistakes, don't they? You hit me with your shoe. It'll be fine even if you count it. But come for sure. - Come. - Long live amputated leg. I'll come because you told me to. - Let's go. - Come. - Had it been for anyone else, I wouldn't have gone. - All right. Uncle's coming, boss. Here. He's come. Come uncle. Come. Sit, uncle. Carefully. Get some nice sweets for the uncle. There should be one piece of cannabis in the sweets. It should be special. Very good. Come, Parker. Come, boss. Sit here. - Have you got the party along? - Yes, c ome. Come, uncle, sit there. This is the matter. Manager, this is my boss, Mr. Chandan. - Very good. - He's won the lottery. Congratulations. He's congratulating you. Thank you. And he's uncle. His uncle, my uncle. You can say he's uncle to the whole world. - Hello uncle. - Long live amputated leg. Pay the money. We'll return to our village. Oh ho uncle. You're always in a hurry. Agreed that money is too much. There's something called humanity, too. - What, boss. - Yes uncle. - Mr. Parker is right. - Yeah, Mr. Parker is always right. It's me who's not right anymore. All right. Where's the ticket? - Ticket. - Yeah, here's the ticket. Here's the ticket. - Is this a ticket? - Here's the ticket. Read it. See it. JBT1429. Very good. On this joyous occassion, sweeten your mouths. I've got such nice sweets that everyone'll enjoy. And special for uncle. Take uncle, have one. - No I won't eat. - Uncle have. Eat. Now because you're saying, I'll eat. Mr. Parker, for boss. Here, boss. Sweets. Okay, now all of you have sweets. I'll finish this. Okay. Bhagwan. Carefully. Here's a staircase. Here. Yes. Please come. Wait. Uncle, you wait here. This is bank business. Only 2 can go with one, not 4. See, how happy uncle is. - It's important to be happy. - Yes. Come Mr. Khanna. I've been waiting for you a long time. Please sit. Mr. Sharma. He's Mr. Chandan. He's won the lottery. This is his ticket and papers. Congratulations. Sit. A pleasure to meet you. But I'm very sorry he can't see. Yes, I am his eyes. - What say, Mr. Chandan? - Yes. Very good. You're very lucky. Sir, do you want the money in cash? Hey sir, why should he take such a big risk? You open an account in the bank. He'll withdraw cash as needed. What? - But... - Yes, Chandan, boss? Yes. You do as Mr. Parker says. See, because you can't see... we'll need one more signature along with your signature. - I'm here for this service. - But you? What say, Mr. Chandan? Yes. All right. Oh ho. If this is alright, we'll do as you wish. - My work is over. I'll leave. - Very good. You leave. He's a bit worried. This time the tickets haven't sold. Boss. Boss. Take this, sir. A receipt for Rs. 450000 and this check. Give it. I'll keep it Chandan boss. Thank you very much. - Okay, I wish you good luck. - Thank you. Come, boss. Where's uncle? - Uncle. - Very good. - Uncle is sleeping in the car. - Did you see? The intoxication of wealth is odd. You've have the wealth and he is enjoying. All right Mr. Parker. Come. Let's go. Come. The municipality will take care of this. - What did you say Mr. Parker? - Nothing. There's a lot of garbage lying on the road. Let's go. Come. Come carefully. Come, boss. This is the famous eating joint of Bombay, Persian Dairy. Here you'll get samosa, tea, milk... kofta, liver, everything very tasty. Come sit. Boy. What's happened to me? What's happened to me? What's happening to me? Come boss. Come, boss. This is the famous hotel of Bombay. Taj Mahal. - We'll have tea here. - Let's go. Hey, did you see him? Who? His name is Chandan. Tall, fair. He's become rich recently. New millionaire? Big brother. Go and find him at the Mahalaxmi racecourse. Or search for him at the Kalbadevi satya market. Hey, listen. He's blind. He's blind? Then go and find him on the railway tracks. Juhu beach. Or look for him at J.J. Hospital. This is Bombay, my dear. Understand? Come, boss. Come. Come here. - Bhagwan. - Yes. Take care of uncle. He shouldn't have any trouble. Whenever he asks for his pipe, fill it for him. Very good, Mr. Parker. I'm starting to get along with uncle. He's not a stranger to me. Hot food to eat. Soft bed to sleep. I've made him sleep like a king. How will he not sleep, boss? First, the joy of wealth. Second, he's tired the whole day. And on top of it all, uncle's eaten so much food cooked in butter... that he soon fell asleep. I mean, unconscious. Come, Mr. Chandan. Have some food. I've cooked with the same hands that you praised yesterday. Come, come. Let uncle sleep here. I've searched. Now where'll I look for him? Wealth is the biggest weakness of a man. Big people go mad. He's just a small villager. All right, but I hadn't expected Chandan to turn his back on me. Who are you talking to, uncle? I said, you're very scared. Is it pick pockets? My pocket isn't stolen, brother. My heart's been stolen. Boss Chandan, we've been looted. We're destroyed Mr. Chandan. We're destroyed. We're looted. - What happened, Mr. Parker? - Uncle's gone. - Uncle's gone? - Yes. - Where? - I don't know where he's gone. He's left this paper with insults to me. - Abuses? - Yes. If you don't believe me, then should I read it? - Should I? - Yes. He's written. Now you're not mine anymore. Give them company. And those scoundrels Further, there are abuses. And it's written that I am dead for you and you're dead for me. Now your life and death with those dancing people and that... Again there's some slang. And he's written... that your money is for you and my village for me. There's more slang. And he's written... Long live amputated leg. Uncle abused a kind man like Parker. He's not done good. Uncle's made a mistake. Punish me for that. Uncle is my anytime. This money is his and even I am his. Bindi made of pearls. Embellished earrings on the ears. Gold bangles from here to here. A necklace made of nine jewels on the neck. - Enough sister. - What's enough? This, Bindiya, earrings, bangles, necklace. What else do you want? Naughty girl. - Sister. - Yes. When father and Chandan brother return from the city... what'll they bring for me? For you? They'll bring good toys for you. Gold bangles for these tiny wrists. - True? - Yes. Then I'll roam the whole village. I'll show my bangles to everyone. And listen. That Banwari's there? Show him, too. I took care of that this morning. He turned green with envy when I mentioned... my father will get so much money. What happened father? Chandan's not come? Chandan? He has drowned in the ocean of money. His eyes were blind. Today even his heart's gone blind. - Brother Chandan's not come? - Radha! Don't utter his name. Wealth's broken all the relations. He won't come. He'll never come. Never? How's this possible? And uncle? You've got the money? I say if the place falls short, then keep some stuff at my place. Hello to the palace people. Hello. Tell us uncle. You've brought the money in a sack or in a bag? You've come walking or in a car? Hey, Chandan wronged poor uncle. He turned his eyes as soon as he got the money. And where did he have eyes? - God had just put 2 buttons. - Stop the nonsense. What wrong have I done to you people... that you've begun taunting me? Go away. I say go away from here. - Otherwise, by God I'll break your heads. - Hey! Let's go. Hello to the queen of the palace. Come. Otherwise uncle will break our heads. Cheater, fraud. I should go to my village. Whenever you talk about leaving, my heart sinks. Tears start rolling down my eyes. I don't know what's happened to me. I don't know what you've done. Father. Shut up you father's daughter. You're spilling water on my dignity. You're spoiling the family name. You're loving a blind man blindly. You idiot. Father. Please, you don't say anything to him. I can listen to everything. But I won't listen to bad things about him. Shameless. Have some shame. Drown to your death. Enacting love in front of your father? And that too with this blind beggar. Father, you don't taunt me addressing him. Otherwise I'll break my head. I'll kill myself. - Ms. Leela. - Yes. What are you saying? Listen to your father. Insulting the father is a bad thing. Wow. You're teaching her in front of me. And behind my back you romance her. This blind man is quite smart. Father! You father's daughter. Listen to me properly. If you don't leave this blind lover of yours... you'll have to lose your sighted father. And wash your hands of his entire wealth. - I don't care. - Don't care. I'll take the car and bungalow away from you. - I don't care. - I'll even take away your clothes and jewelry. - You can't meet anyone from my family. - I don't care. Think twice. - I've already thought. - Ms. Leela. What are you doing? What's happened to you? Whatever I'm doing is correct, Mr. Chandan. Hey old man. Get out of here. Don't know whose father he is? Isn't he ashamed of taking away daughter's clothes and jewelry. What'll people say? Shut up, you Parker. You keep quiet. I'll make you taste death while you're alive. Mind it. Leela. My clothes and jewelry should be returned by tomorrow. Yes, they will be. All right. I'm going. Ms. Leela, you've not done well. It is not right for a daughter to dissociate herself from her father. - A father always wishes for his child's welfare. - Mr. Chandan. Whatever's happened, I'm not sad. I'm worried for what's going to happen. I can arrange money. But not right away. Oh ho. What's there to be scared of? Now take the money from boss. When you have yours, return his. - What say, boss? - Yes, all right, Mr. Parker. Ms. Leela, take as much as you want. But don't leave your father because of me. Thank you Mr. Chandan. Thanks a lot. Doesn't matter. I, too, should go home now. I don't know what the villagers must be thinking of me. I would never stop you. But there's a problem. - What is it? - That is... In 2 days there's a celebration of the widow's home. And I've promised those people... that boss will be the chairman. But I'm a villager. How can I be the chairman? You're a God. If you don't go, they'll feel badly. All right. But after the celebration I'll immediately return to my village. All right. And if you're in so much of a hurry... then I'll send Bhagwan by car. He'll go and fetch uncle, Basanti, Radha, all of them. Bhagwan. Yes. See. You go to the village right away. And return with Radha, uncle and Basanti immediately with you. And if they don't come, then tell them that we're reaching. Very good. So, boss, are you happy now? Yes, Mr. Parker. So well you take care of me. Why're you embarrassing me? Long live amputated leg, uncle. Long live amputated leg. How are you Ramdin? I'm good uncle. But I feel sad on seeing you. Listen to my advice and get Basanti married off. Married? Yes uncle. Ramdin is right. One shouldn't make a young girl sit at home. Uncle, Chandan is not going to come now. Look for another boy. Yes. I'll have to look for one. Uncle, did you hear something? Banwari has started being religious. My God. Yesterday I was reading the Banwari's horoscope. His future's bright. Where'll you go to find another boy? Get Basanti married to him. All right priest. If you're saying... then I'll have to think about it. My God. Ramsingh is too much. Take this and you'll also remember that you've met a wealthy guy. Take one rupee. - One rupee? - What else? You'd said that if I praise a lot then you'll give me 10 rupees. Why are you worried? Let the task be finished, then I'll fill your bag with money. Give me my commission. Your task is accomplished. Soon you'll be a groom. Why not priest? Why not? Take this. Even you take 25 paise. - 25 paise? - Yes. I had come with huge expectations. Let my expectations come true... and then yours will, too. This is the way. Why're you readying me like a groom today? It's a function of widows. And the chairman is not less than a groom. And what function? Thousands of old, young and kids, must have come to see you. Flowers will be showered on you. The musicians will play the songs. And shouts of your salutations will reach the sky. All right. Let's go. Those people must be waiting for us. No one should be troubled because of me. Let's go. Long live the boss. Boss, I wish you could see. Doesn't matter. But you must be hearing the band playing. It's playing so nicely. Boss, looks like there must be at least 5000 people here. Hey, don't throw flowers. Quiet. Boss, on my right are only women everywhere. On my left, there are only men. Yes, boss. Quiet. Brothers and sisters... I request you to remain silent. Take your seats. Stop the band, please. Come Mr. Harwanshlal. Please come. Give, I'll garland him. Boss, here's a garland from Harwanshlal for you. And what's this? 500 Rs.? Wow! Brothers, Rs. 500 for the widow's home from Sir Harwanshlal. Hey, Gulsamakhan. How come you're here? Brothers. I wasn't aware of the rule here. I saw that a lot of widows have gathered here. I felt bad. Oh God! Why did you double the number of widows in this region? Brothers, you buy bungalows, cars. Hey oblivious people, buy goodness. My entire life savings... around 11.25 Rs... has become Rs. 11.25... because I'm soft. I am soft hearted and so is my pocket. But I sacrificed all my savings for this. Gentlemen. Brothers, see the sentiments of this poor man. These are not just Rs 11.25, but they're 11.25 lakhs. Stop the clapping. Now, at last I would request the chairman, Mr. Chandan... speak a few words which will give peace to these sad widows. Stop clapping. Brothers and sisters... how can I be of service to you? Joy and sorrow are God's creations. Even then, I promise you... I'll help you as much as I can. I'll keep doing... and always keep going. Stop clapping. Brothers, you'll be happy to know that... Sir Chandan... has donated Rs. 40000 for the widow's home. Sir. Boss. Long live the boss. Long live the boss. You sign here and take this check for Rs. 40000. Thank you. Now this hotel's mine. Not just the hotel, but everything in it is yours. - Really? - Yes. So, get out. Now? Right now. From the gate where you used to throw me out... from the same gate you get out on your own. Get out. Very good. The owner of each and everything over here. Me. Oh you boys and butlers... you'll keep working here. But whatever you've done to me... you'll be punished for that. Hold your ears and do sit ups. Ready? One two. One... two, three. What's this? Stop. All of you together. Let's start again. Ready? One two. One two. Three. Four. My Lord. Basanti, I've left everything and turned to God. I've just been to the Baba Vishwanath temple. So? Then? I'd got the prasad's halwa and puri for you. Right now I gave it to uncle. Uncle was very happy. God swear Basanti. I've recited the whole night standing on one leg in the temple. Go, you scoundrel. Does a mind change after changing clothes? I know everything. - What do you know? - That you bought halwa... from the Makhan's sweets shop. And you've stolen the flowers from the landowner's garden. - My lord. - Keep quiet. A wolf in sheeps clothing. My lord. Leave here. Go home. It's almost night time. Whatever you say Basanti. Let me tell you. The priest has said you'll marry a sighted man. Not a blind man. My God! Long live the amputated leg. May you be destroyed. Always cross my path like a cat. Useless. Get out of here. You? Here. All right. Now tell me where I am. Now? Here. Now tell me where I am. Mr. Chandan. Find me. Where am I? Chandan. Chandan. Chandan. Where am I? Chandan. Chandan. Where am I? You're here. Now where am I? Now, you're here. Here. - No. What happened? - Boss? Did you learn anything about uncle? Any message from the village? - What happened? - My God, why did you do this? You've come, Mr. Bhagwan Das? How's Basanti? How's Radha? Has Uncle's anger calmed down? You donkey. First tell us then cry. You speak, Mr. Bhagwan Das. Uncle, Radha, Basanti. Are they all right? What to say, boss? You asked about uncle, Basanti. Not a single animal was alive. The entire village is destroyed. Village destroyed? How's that? Because of plague. There's no sign of people till far away. Even the fish from nearby rivers have disappeared. - Mr. Parker. - Yes. Take me to the village. - I must go now. - Let's go. Bhagwan, arrange for the car right now. Ms. Leela... - you get the boss ready. - All right. Come, Mr. Chandan. This is my village. Uncle. Basanti. Radha. I've come. The sad part is that you can't see. The entire village is empty. - See, locks on the houses. - Carefully. This is my house. I'm in my village. Radha. Basanti. Uncle. Lock? What happened to these people? Makhan uncle. Lakhiya. Hey, whose voice was that? Some dog was crying. Government notice? What's written? It's written. Plague has spread in this village. Don't touch anything here. I'm saying, that wasn't a dog, but a messenger of death. Let's go. Villagers. You don't know why you've been called here. Today is a very happy day. Today a son is born at our landowner's house. And he's sent these sweets to distribute among the villagers. Along with 1 rupee cash. Wow! Now I ask you... with whose hands should we start this auspicious task? If you ask me, I'll say that... this auspicious task. Some saint-like hero... and a just person's hands. And who is such a person in our village? Our uncle. All right. Come uncle. Don't hurt the villagers. Now distribute the sweets. Come, brothers. Take, uncle. Uncle. Very good. There they go back. Very good. The work is done. Your work is done. What about my work? Why're you scared? I've brought stuff for you, too. - Remove it. - See, new notes of Rs. 100. Very good. You are great. There's one more thing. There's time, you go from here. If the villagers come to know, your head will be shaved. Oh my God! I'm going. I went to the village, the villagers are not here. I'm very sad, Ms. Leela. You don't know. Mr. Chandan, confide in me. If the gift of my life, can bring back your happiness... then take my life. - Ms. Leela. - Mr. Chandon. Just the way I've forgotten my parents, siblings everyone for you... Similarly you, too, forget the village and the villagers. I wish you could see... that I've become an ascetic for you. I've seen you without the eyes, Ms. Leela. You're truly a goddess. Hello, boss. Hello Mr. Parker. Where had you been? Last night you were coughing in your sleep. We were very worried. We didn't sleep the whole night. I'm coming from the temple. First worship... then donate to the beggars. After that I kept asking the God. Oh God... why have you given a cough to my boss? Mr. Parker... in this world, when no one of mine is left... you take such good care of me. No one's left. What're you saying? I am yours. Ms. Leela is yours. And you're mine. You're right, Mr. Parker. The hearts are getting along so well. No one can separate the three of us. Well said. This amerger should be celebrated with a grand party. - Bhagwan. - Very good. Keep quiet, you owl's tail. Listen. A Russian band from Kolkatta. English sweets from France... and French cakes from England shall be ordered. Don't worry about money. But the party should be grand. Very good. Do look at me, my dear, in that graceful style Let them be envious; it matters not a whit These mad desires tell their own story This youthful season sends out its own signs Save your honor if you can. These night are no longer beautiful Do look at me, my dear, in that graceful style Let them be envious; it matters not a whit Demur if you have made promises; do not express your desires An aeon has passed; do wind your arms around my neck Don't forget, my dear, this heart is fated to go away Do look at me, my dear, in that graceful style Let them be envious; it matters not a whit What fear have I of the world? Do I notice anything around me? I have become so obsessed I know not myself anymore Tell me, can I even see anyone other than you? Do look at me, my dear, in that graceful style Let the envious envy. It's their problem. See, with such a sweet style Let them be envious; it matters not a whit How times have changed. This same Parker couldnt't even get a proper meal. And was only a small agent in my company. But today he has everything. It happens, Mr. Khanna. - At times nights are long and sometimes days. - Right. But, who's that person? - He's the villager from Anandpur, Chandan. - All right. - The poor thing is blind. - Blind? Yes. Unfortunately he's won the first prize in the lottery. As soon as he got the money, he fell prey to these people. Fell prey? Then why didn't you make him understand? I tried a lot, doctor. But now he's even gone deaf. Sometimes I think... that if he could see again... Doctor, can you do something? Mr. Khanna. The well doesn't go near the thirsty. The thirsty go to the well. Come, let's go. Banwari is such a nice boy. Whenever he meets me, he touches my feet. That day he distributed sweets amongst the villagers... that, too, with my hands. Basanti. I've decided you'll marry Banwari. What've you done father? You're fed up with your daughter? A father doesn't get his daughter married out of frustration. He has to be very strong while giving his daughter away. Why do you keep the stone on your heart, father? Hit me on my head and kill me so you won't have to give me away. Basanti. Kill me, father. Don't destroy my dreams. Your dreams are false. The blind man that cheated me... why would he even bother about you? You are like a lamp in front of ocean in front of him. Basanti, I say forget him. I'll forget. I promise... if I receive confirmation that Chandan's forgotten us. Take me to Bombay, father. Bombay? I'll take you to Bombay. Yes, father. Chandan is blind. He must have lost his path. The city people must have given him false support. Take me to the city, father. I'll find him. Do you want... for the villagers to make fun of us all over again? Let the world laugh. People will settle. Storms will come, father... but the lamps that last can never be blown out. Listen to me only once, father. Last time. If the dreams turn out to be false? Then I'll accept defeat. Sit me in a pallenquin. Like a cow, with my eyes closed, I'll go wherever you send me father. Let's go this very day. Let's see this also. Come. I've searched all these markets and streets. We've been roaming for two days. We could find a poor Chandan in the city. You'll find a millionaire Chandan, Basanti, never. Let's return to our village. One last attempt, father. I couldn't find him. Maybe my voice can. Chandan won't be able to recognise my face. But he'll recognise my voice. He'll call me on hearing me sing, father. All right. Go. Try that too. Go. I don't know on which streets I'm lost I can't recognise the streets of love My love, where should I find you? Where should I entertain my mind? Where should I go now? The heart's agreed. Still the mouth is shut How should I say that I like my sweetheart? The heart's agreed Whose evil eye has caught us? Where has my love lost his path? If I get your address, I'll come flying without wings I'll snatch you from the world The heart's agreed. Still the mouth is shut How should I say that I like my sweetheart? The heart's agreed - Radha. Hey Radha. - Father. I don't know what happened to her. She's running a high fever. Who are you? Why are you blocking the path? Take these two annas. Be gone from here. No brother. I'm not a beggar. With God's grace I get 16 every month. Do me a favor by guiding us to a doctor. My child has a high fever. - She has a fever? - Yes. What are you waiting for. In front, on the second floor there's a good doctor. Take this girl there immediately. - Thank you, brother. - Come father. - Come Basanti. - Radha. - Radha. Get up my child. - Come. Doctor. Who is it? Long live the amputated leg, doctor. Doctor. See, what's happened to my daughter. Neither does she eat or say anything. And she's running high fever. You people must not know I'm an eye doctor. We are villagers. How can we know there are different kinds of doctors? Cure my sister, doctor. Doctor, for God's sake, do us a favor. All right. Come with me. Lie her down. Chandan. - Chandan, brother. - Chandon? Who is she calling? That same idiot... for whom we've left our home. He's blind. He won a lottery of Rs. 4.5 million. Turned his eyes as soon as he got the money. Blind. A lottery of Rs. 4.5 million. Isn't this the Parker Chandan? - Yes. - Do you know him? What's his address? Where is he? Now he's where a person forgets God. It's difficult to meet him. If it's difficult, then let him go to hell. Shoot him. I don't want to meet him who doesn't want to meet us. Doctor, you cure my daughter. It'll be a big favor. Don't worry. I'll call another doctor. Hello. Doctor Harwansh? A patient for you has come to my clinic by mistake. Yes, the innocent child's unconscious in fever. It's important for you to come here. Yes? Thank you, doctor. I'll wait for you. Doctor. Come. I want to tell you something. Before saying yours, first listen to me. I have no cure for the heart's disease. I'm very sad, doctor. No one understands the pain of my heart. - Apart from Chandan? - Yes? How's he related to you? We are childhood friends. You'll be sad to hear this child... that he was blind, but now he's even become deaf. Your voice won't reach him now. Don't say that. We love each other a lot. This, too, is your mistake. Child, he's changed a lot. That's what I want to see. If wealth has changed him, or the world has? Which power has snatched him away from me? What if your sorrow increases after seeing? I'm prepared for that. Just once, I'll see him. Doctor, you're like my father. Help me. Very good. Very good. All right. So this is Chandan's house? Not a house, a hotel. And the owner of this hotel is Chandan's friend, Parker. All the drama happens in this hotel. Drama? You're so friendly, Ms. Leela. - When your hand comes in mine. - Then? Then I feel that the darkness has gone. Lamps are lit at every step. This is your love, Mr. Chandan. By giving me a place in your heart... you've changed my destiny. Even I don't love anyone else in this world apart from you. And I don't want anyone else to love you. Your love has bought me. The world is envious of our love, Mr. Chandan. Let them be. Did you see that? God, thank you so much. You've cured my tiny girl. And doctor's a God. In two days, he brought the dead to life. All right child. You eat the orange. And I'll get small bangles for you from the market. We'll return to the village today. And Chandan brother? Don't mention his name. He's dead for us and we for him. Basanti. So? Have the tears come? Haven't they? I told you already you wouldn't be able to watch. A blind man getting lost isn't a big deal doctor. My mind says that whatever my eyes have seen is false. I'm sure there's foul play here. Chandan's very innocent, doctor. Possible. But I'd say it's your love that's innocent. Anyway, I've done all I can. I can do nothing more. Why not? You're an eye doctor. You can fix eyes. Doctor, you've called me daughter. A daughter asks the light of life from a father. Say yes, doctor, I beg you. Yes, but how can I cure the eyes of a person who's been blind from birth? No, he's not blind from birth. He fell from a tree during childhood. He lost his eyesight in the fall. Oh ho. Really? Then I'll try. May God bless you. Doctor, you used to say the thirsty one goes to the well. The well doesn't go to the thirsty. But what's with the well, that it's looking for the thirsty? See this photo. I don't understand. This photo is of my dead Munni. I've met a village girl. Had my Munni been alive today, she would have looked like her. I've called her my daughter. And not a doctor's, but a father's duty Mr. Khanna... I want to examine Mr. Chandan's eyes. Help me. But the people to whom he has fallen prey are very dangerous. We'll have to do something. Idea. What idea? Using tit for tat. This letter is from the king of Chandipur. - King of Chandipur? - You just watch. Sister, father wants to go back. Basanti, I've brought the car. Hurry up or we'll miss the train. Father, I won't return to the village. What? Why? Tell me. I ask why won't you? Chandan is in the city. How'll I go back to the village? Have you gone mad? Looks like the city water is poisoned. It turns the blood of villagers to white. Come. I say come. No, Chandan is surrounded by jackals. They'll eat him up. I won't leave him here. Won't go? You? Then how can I return? What can I say to the villagers? Tell me! Tell them father... you already got me engaged. Now you'll get them married. Don't take the daughter from her beloved! My world is here. I won't go. Understood. I understood everything, Basanti. Come, Radha. Father. Father. Your father's dead today. Father! I'm going. Still, you have my blessings. May God keep you happy. But remember... If Chandan refuses you... then never return to the village. The door of father's house will be closed to you permanently. Come, Radha. Congratulations! Congratulations, madam Leela. Why? The decision of my heart hinges on one look. Whose heart? You'll be fascinated to hear what's in this letter. I am in love with you. I am in love with you. You are unrivalled. Live long. Your face is so mesmerizing! Your eyes are so magical. You are gorgeous, madam Leela. Really? So you noticed my love only today? You don't get it. The king of Chandipur, not I. - The king of Chandipur? - Yes. The sacrificial lamb. The poor chap has gift-wrapped his heart in the letter. You markswoman. I thought only the blind could be injured. But a person with eyes has fallen in this case. Listen to me. This king of Chandipur is charmed by your locks. He wishes to conduct business. That's why he wants to see you at the Worli sea face at 5:00. So get decked up. You have to deal with a person who can see. Not a blind person. Just you watch. All I need is for him to look into my eyes. Is that so? Then hurry. - Where are you getting ready to go? - Come in! Come in, boss, come in. It's like this, boss. Your money is rotting away from non-use. Either it will rot away completely or finish off. That's why we want to use the money to do something big... where it can be multiplied from 2-4, 4-8... 18-16, 16-32. That it continues to double. We're going to meet a big businessman in this regard. Please pray that we succeed. Yes, yes, Mr. Parker. Go ahead. I shall pray. Very well. Get ready quickly, madam Leela. Hurry. God, wherever Mr. Parker and Leela have gone... with whatever motive they have gone, please let them succeed. Both are so ethical. The poor things shed their blood where my sweat drops. And God... may I say something to your mightiness? Is it possible, God, for me to regain my eyesight? So I could see this Goddess and my godlike friend? - May I come in? - Who is it? - Mr. Manager? - That's right. It is I. Come in, come in. Please sit. What brings you here today? I've been trying to see you for the past several days. But your companion, Mr.Parker is like the wall of China. He refuses to let anyone meet you. Don't say that, Mr. Manager. He doesn't forbid anyone from seeing me. Leela's father, the head of the ashram for widows... sages, saints, the poor, the needy... he's allowed me to meet every kind of person. Mr. Parker is very affable. You're very naive, Mr. Chandan. You don't know Mr. Parker. He's a very dangerous man. Mr. Manager! You are insulting my friend. I don't wish to hear one word against him. Who's with you? This is my friend, Dr. Mukherjee. The best eye surgeon. - Eye surgeon? - Correct. Mr. Manager was all praises for you. I felt like meeting you, so I accompanied him. So God heeded my plea. Doctor, please look into my eyes... and tell me if I can regain my eyesight. Can I see again? I can only answer that after a complete examination of your eyes. For that, you'll have to accompany me to my hospital. - I'm willing. - So come along. Get up, get up. But Leela and Mr. Parker... Don't worry about them. I'll leave a note for them. You go and get ready while the manager pens a note. - Very well. - A pen please, doctor. Hold on, please. Yes. No light. Yes. Yes. Wonderful. Lights on. What do you see, doctor? There's a ninety percent chance of success. But the operation must take place immediately. Doctor, there will be light in my dark life again. - Will I be able to see? - God willing, you'll certain see. - Okay, then I'm willing. - Very good. Mr. Manager, please summon Mr. Parker and Leela. Who but they will tend to me? I'm here to tend to you. The nurse is here. - Why do you need them? - Alright, doctor. I think if Mr. Parker and madam Leela suddenly find out... you can see, they'll be very pleased. It would be best not to inform them. - That's true. - It's absolutely true. You need not worry. Doctor, please prepare to operate. - I shall inform them. - Very good. Boss. Boss, Chandan. - Mr. Chandan. - Where has he gone? Strange. The seeing person is missing over there... and the blind one over here. Chasing the seeing one, we lost the blind one, too. Just where could he go? Did the earth swallow him, or the sky? Mr. Parker, my idea is that sir must have gone to the movies. That's why I say you're a bloody fool. You idiot! When the seeing person can't see the blind... how will the blind see the movie? Get lost! Very well, very well, very well, very well, very well, very well. Useless chap! Leela, come here. - What's the matter? - Look at this. 'Hello, Mr. Parker.' Hello. 'Every family man should have knowledge of religion.' Absolutely. 'That's why I'm taking Mr. Chandan to Kashi with me.' 'I will bring him back in eight to ten days.' How dare he? 'Do not worry. Well wisher, Omkarnath Shastri.' Who's that? Looking at uncle's condition it's apparent... Mr. Chandan was out of our hands and now even Basanti is gone. You could have at least heeded the villagers if not me. You wouldn't have to go through this. The boat of greed always drowns, scholar. He lost the bridle along with the ass. Now what you'll do, rich man? God. God, please never let anyone have a daughter. Father, don't say that. I'm a girl too. Yes, my child. I made a mistake. I thought I'd lost everything with Basanti's departure. You are the Laxmi of this house now. You're my prestige, my girl. What prestige? You sold the Laxmi of your house in the city, uncle. A girl from our village has gone to the village. Go drown yourself. You go drown! Who do you think you are to say evil things to my father? Or talking about my sister? Go away from here. Go! Radha, don't worry, my girl. Let them talk and say what they want. No father, let go of me. They're in for it today. They made you cry, I'll make them cry. Go away from here. Go! - Radha. - Father. Radha. Make Chandan's eyes alright, God. Make them alright. I appeal to you. Congratulations! Congratulations! The operation was successful. - It was successful? - Yes. Doctor, will Chandan be able to see? He will definitely see. Bless you, doctor. How do I thank you? Silly, I consider you my daughter. You don't need to thank your father. I've only done my duty. Now you must do your duty. What should I do, doctor? Serve him with all your heart. But don't say a word, no matter what happens. Become completely mute. Else all my plans will go for nothing. But what's the secret behind being mute, doctor? I'll tell you at the appropriate time. Come along. Parker! Parker! What are you thinking? - I'm thinking? - Yes, yes, you're thinking. Oh yes, I was thinking... it's been ten to fifteen days since the blind man has gone. Has the earth swallowed him, or the sky? I can't understand the Kashi angle. I'm sure something's amiss. So, why do you have to worry about it? You're very cool. One hundred twenty thousand are rotting away in the bank. I mean to say it's wasting. If I got hold of it, I'd spruce things up. I'm not cool, you are. When the blind man used to sign the checks... and put them before you... why didn't you withdraw the whole amount at once? The same old cool! He's blind. The world isn't blind, is it? I have only this scientific, technical and sentimental item. If we get caught at any stage, we'll be imprisoned. Oh darling, you are truly great. Reveal one more secret to me today. - What's that? - Who are you? - Parker. - Not at all. Sometimes you're Francis, sometimes Baiju Bawra... sometimes Rustom and at times Abdul Sattar the masseur. Today I want to know exactly who you are. Don't ask. You'll regret it. I must know today. And you have to tell me. Very well. Then I'll tell you. I am Mr. Johnny. I have roamed the world After roaming around the world I've become an Indian You want to know why? I'll tell you right away I am Johnny. I am very wicked I am Mr. Johnny.

I have roamed the world After roaming around the world I've become an Indian You want to know why? I'll tell you right away I am Johnny. I am very wicked Who are you? Who are you, I ask? Tell me. Tell me. Answer me. Doctor! Doctor! What happened? What's the matter, son? Who is this? Who is bringing me sorrow along with joy? Sorrow? What sorrow has this poor girl brought you? Sorrow... She reminds me... of one I wish to forget. Someone I have forgotten, doctor. Someone whom I have completely forgotten. Who is she? Why isn't she saying anything? She's a nurse, son. She serves you day and night. She doesn't speak because the poor girl is mute. She's mute? Please forgive me, lady. I have erred. God's ways are mysterious. Open the curtains. I can see! I can see! I can see! I can see! Thanks a million, God! - Doctor. - I'm over here, son. Doctor. Doctor, you've done me a huge favor. I will never forget your favor all my life. Son, I've only done my duty as a doctor. - Who is this? - This is my assistant. - And this? - This is your mute nurse. The one who served you day and night. Thanks to her, you've regained your eyesight. Maybe this operation wouldn't have succeeded without her. Bless you, lady. You have brought light to my dark world. I pray God brings light in your life. I hope all your wishes come true. Doctor, please escort me home. Leela and Mr. Parker must be awaiting me very anxiously. When they learn I can see, they'll be so pleased. Leela will go insane with pleasure. She'll light lamps in the temples. She'll open up the treasury for the destitute. Oh! So Leela loves you very much? Yes, doctor. For my sake she left her parents... her home, her land and property. She's done much for me. Doctor, please escort me home. - Very well. Please escort him to his house. - Very well. - Thank you, doctor. - Goodbye. - I'll get dressed first. - Okay. Doctor, what happened here, doctor? He regained his eyesight. He saw me but didn't recognize me. His world is lit up, doctor, but why has my world gone dark? So that when your world is lit up... there's no other person who can make it dark again. My girl, may your world always be full of happiness! Be a little patient and do as I tell you. - Doctor. - My girl. - Madam Leela. - No. Only Leela. Your Leela. Oh yes. Absolutely correct. The blind one who called you madam Leela has vanished. Let him go, darling. I only love you. The others in my world are blind. Who is it? Oh no! The blind one has come. Could he have heard us? He must have not heard. You lie down with the blanket. Mr. Parker. Madam Leela. Welcome, boss! Boss. Come. Welcome, boss. Welcome. Madam Leela, the boss is here. Boss, ever since you left, madam Leela hasn't been in her senses. I just gave her a dose, of medicine. She keeps getting fits and then fever... following fits, following fever, following fits, following fever. She is repeating only one thing. Chanting your name and then falling unconscious. Chanting your name and falling unconscious. Come take a look if you don't believe me. Come, come. Come, come. Come, come, come. Madam Leela. Look at this. She has emptied bottles of medication. Take a look. But her fever refuses to subside. Take a seat. Sit down. She seems to be running a fever of one hundred six. Don't touch her or you'll burn. She is very hot. Anyway... the fever will subside if God wishes. It will surely subside. She might regain consciousness hearing your voice. - Please call out to her. Call her. - Okay. Madam Leela. Madam Leela. I have returned. - Who is it, Mr. Chandan? - Yes. Where did you go? A saint took me to Kashi with him. Didn't you find my letter? I have only had my hopes up because of the letter. You are so hard hearted. Not once did you think, how Leela will survive without you. - Who is it? - Daddy? My girl, what have you done to yourself? Leave this old man and come with me. Daddy! Don't offend him. Quiet! You are dying but you won't stop loving him. What has this old man given you besides love? Tuberculoses. Don't harass your old father any more. - Come with me. - I'll die before leaving him. So die! You old geezer! You dare to behave that way with the boss! - Get out of here. - I'm going. But my ten thousand rupees that I spent on her illness... who will give that to me? By God's grace you'll get it soon. - Mr. Chandan. - Yes, yes. - Mr. Parker. - Yes. Tell him to come get his money tomorrow. Very well. Get out of here, old man. You'll get the money tomorrow. Don't you understand? Are you a father or a clown? - What did you say? - Nothing. - You may leave. - Very well. I'm leaving. I must have the money tomorrow. Very good, very good, very good. How did this old geezer return, Mr. Parker? He came in and I kicked him out. Very well, boss. You've come at a very opportune time. Why? Any particular reason. The orphans function will take place. Five thousand orphans have assembled. Someone told them our Lord Chandan donated... forty thousand rupees to the widow ashram. So you'll surely donate twenty thousand to the orphans. Ten of the city's gentry have come with me for this purpose. They're sitting outside. What shall I do with them? You are absurd. Has the boss ever refused a good deed? You'll come, won't you, boss? Huh? Yes. You see? He never utters a refusal. He'll attend. Very well, very well, very well, very well, very well, very well. Welcome. It's raining flowers. Move out of the way. Move! Give us way. Move aside. Move! Move! Welcome, boss. Welcome. He is here, brothers. He is here. Calm down, brothers. Sit down. Sit down. Brothers and sisters, today's function is for the orphans... whose parents were making merry like us until yesterday. They used to travel by cars, watch movies. They played hockey and football. But today they are no more. Today they're in the place where all of us must go in the future. But before leaving it is our duty to do something for these kids. Don't forget, after going there you won't get a taxi or car. No movies or plays. No hockey or football. Only what you give here will be useful to you. There is no argument in this trade. There's no discrimination between the fair and the dark. Money of every kind is good. You get it, brothers? Sir Jagatnarain, five thousand. Sir Devkinandan, five thousand. Sir Rokarmal Phokatchand, seven thousand five hundred. Make your donation as well. Sign the check. Here. Long live the boss! Long live the boss! Long live the boss! Doctor. - What is it, my girl? - I wish to return to the village. Why? I'm no longer needed here. You silly. You've lost courage so soon. - Doctor! - Chandan? Make me blind again. Break my eyes. What are you saying, son? What's the matter with you? I left from here with a tornado of desires. But what I perceived to be flowers turned out to be thorns. The twinkling stars of my hopes turned into flames. I don't wish to see anything more, doctor. Return my darkness to me. I don't want light. You got scared seeing the world as it is? The world? Where a friend smothers friendship? Where a lady turns into a snake and bites the priest? Where sin is disguised as good deeds and bleeds humanity dry? Where these human beings embrace you... and then stab you in the back? I'll go insane, doctor. Make me blind. Make me blind again. Son, the eyes are God's biggest gift. And destroying them deliberately is a great sin. When everyone is a sinner... then my sins won't harm the world or God. It will surely be harmful. Son, the fools are known to commit sins... but if a good man like you starts walking on their path... then the devil will rule this earth instead of God. I cannot think straight, doctor. Tell me what to do. Son, God has lit up your extinguished lamps. Brighten your future and that of others with their light. Bring the strayed people on the right path. And remember, God should win. Not the devil. You are blessed, doctor. I will never forget your advice. I swear by God, only God will win. Not the devil. The world has changed. The people in the world have changed. It appears as though the devil is reigning in this sinful world. Who knew a daughter would rebel against her father? It's been twenty days. She hasn't written one letter. Anyway, Basanti is dead as far as I am concerned. Father, what if sister were to come home? I'll close the door of my house. I'I tell the entire village not to offer one sip of water to Basanti. Even if she dies of thirst. 'Dear Radha, my love to you. My greetings to father.' 'Chandan has seen the world.' 'But he is as scared as a child is of fire.' 'There is a battle between good and evil.' 'Tell father to forgive me and pray for me.' 'Your sister Basanti.' Radha, give the letter to me. - No. - Give it to me. Take this, one rupee. - I won't give it to you. - Take two rupees. Two rupees. Basanti. Go, my girl. I forgive you, my girl. I forgive you. And prayers... I'll go to the temple right away and pray for you. Mr. Parker. Madam Leela. Mr. Chandan? Mr. Chandan, where did you vanish suddenly? I went to visit that saint. He was pleased with me today and gave me this book. - Book? - Yes. He said I should read this morning and evening. I'll benefit from it. Who better than you to read it to me? - Yes, yes. Give it to me. I'll read it to you. - Okay. Yes. Read it. When a woman loses her character... the land and the skies tremble, never mind man. What nonsense is this? Then? This is a photograph of the temples in Kashi. The place of the Gods. Next. - Jaganath, Puri. - Great pilgrimage. Next. The golden temple of Amritsar. The shrine of Guru Nanak's love. Next? Jamia Masjid in Delhi. Where people forget the world and kneel in obeisance. Next? And this is the Taj Mahal of Agra. Oh! The memorial of two lovers. Next? Why are you silent? Tell me. Tell me this is a photograph of two traitors. The photograph of two snakes... who bit the love of a blind man. What? Can you see? Yes. I have been watching... since the day this game of sin has been playing. These eyes have seen that painful drama of a father and daughter. They've also seen the function where five thousand orphans... were praising me. But I'm innocent. I haven't done anything. You? I thought you were as pure as Sita and Savitri. I seated you on the throne of my heart and worshipped you. I imagined so many things. I so yearned to look at you. I didn't know how low man could stoop for wealth, madam. Mr. Chandan... lnstead of being a support for a blind man... you landed him in a place where... he doesn't love either life or death. You've played such a horrific game. What do you want? I want to gouge your eyes out. So even you stray like me. I want to break your delicate arms... so another good man doesn't use them for support. I want to pull your tongue out... so you don't poison another person's life with its sweetness. Let go of me! Let go! You've taken leave of your senses. No. I've only found my senses today. I'll return all those injuries to you today... which you inflicted on this helpless person. Your face is becoming scarier than death. Let me go. Forgive me. Not even God forgives the sins that are committed deliberately. You sinner, you have seen the spring of life. Now take a look at the shadow of death. Let go! What happened? No! What happened? What's happened? Madam Leela died. She died? Doctor! Doctor! What happened, my girl? A friend is smothering friendship. - Basanti? - A lady turned into a snake and bit the priest. Sin, disguised as a good deed, has bled humanity dry. And, yes, he's fleeing for fear of this world. He's going towards the dark. Doctor! Basanti. Come to your senses, my girl. What is the matter with you? - Doctor... - My girl. Was this a dream? Doctor, what if this dream becomes fact? Keep faith in God, my girl. Justice is delayed but it is not denied. You needlessly prevented me from going, doctor. Let me go to him. Let me go. I'll tell him the world isn't as horrible as he's seen. Not everyone here is Leela and Parker. Sita and Savitri also dwell in this world. Worshippers of love, like me, also exist. And Gods like you also exist. Let me go, doctor. Have some patience, my girl. Let him see the drama of sin and good deeds. After that he'll come. He'll have to come to you. What if he doesn't come? If he doesn't come, I'll know he's not a human being... or that your love isn't powerful enough. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep, my girl. Leela. Mr. Parker. Boss! Boss! Keep courage, Mr. Parker. Keep courage. She died suddenly. Every time I think of her goodness... my eyes tear up involuntarily. And she loved you with her heart and soul. The deceased had many good qualities. But don't grieve, Mr. Parker. Good people are taken away from the world in this way. But that doesn't mean the world is emptied of good people. It is really empty, boss. Mr. Parker, you still have life. I'm not worthy of anything. But I'm telling you the truth. I have peace neither day nor night. Tell me, what should I do? - Come with me. - Where? To that saint in whose presence I find peace. You will find total peace when you get there. - Really? Let's go then. - Yes, yes, Mr. Parker. That's exactly what I want. To get well soon. And to be able to serve you as much as possible. - Come on, let's go. - Come. Come. Boss, we've arrived at the place you mentioned. Indeed. So look around and see if there's a big sacred fig tree. Yes, there is. Alright then. Turn to the left. Come. Careful, boss. There are steps over here. - We've come to the steps? - Yes. Okay. Take a look. One step must be going left and one step must be going right. - Yes. - Take me to the left-side step. Come. Careful. Careful. There are more steps here. Really? Okay, let's go higher. Higher. Really? Careful. What happened, boss? Are you hurt? Yes. Forget it. No problem. Mr. Parker, go up and see if the sage is in his place. Has he began his worship or not? I'll wait here. Very well. Nobody is here. That blind man is harassing me deliberately. - Boss! A miracle took place, boss. - What happened, Mr. Parker? Prayers are going on but I don't see any man. - I can only hear voices. - No, no. - How's that possible? - That's exactly what's happening. No, no. If there are voices then there must be a man. - Come, take me there. - Let's go. Come. Look. The entire field is vacant. There's not a single person. There are only voices, boss. - Who's here? - Nobody is here. Such a beautiful verse.. Brothers, please make way for me. I am blind and helpless. But nobody is here, boss. Look, nobody is here. Mr. Parker, take care. Someone could get hurt. But nobody is here, boss. It's such a big assembly. There must be at least five thousand people. There's nobody here besides the two of us. Mr. Parker, I'm the blind one. Why are you talking like a blind person? - Look there. There. - Where? The priest is seated. You are blessed, priest. You are blessed. You are blessed, priest. You are blessed. Boss, there's a withered tree up ahead. Nothing else. - The priest is reading. Can't you see? - No. Take a seat. Look over there. The priest is sitting on a throne of gold. There is no throne or priest. Nobody is here. Why are you talking like a child, Mr. Parker? When I can see it, why can't you see? Is it possible this priest is visible to the blind, not the seeing? No, no, no, no, no. Not at all. Look there. Look to your left. - Where? - Over there. At least two thousand sages are sitting there in worship. Not even one sage is there. Look over here. One thousand disciples of the saint. There's nothing over there either, boss. What joke is this? Tell me or I shall lose my mind. Where are these sounds coming from? Shall I tell you? - Come with me. - Let's go. Look here, Mr. Parker. This is the sea of humans. This is the assembly of orphans. This is the group of widows who filled my soul with joy. I wish to see you run again. I wish to see you run again. I wish to see you run again. How much should I donate? Ten thousand... twenty thousand, fifty? Tell me how much. No. This is impossible. Are you afraid of your own game? Here, let me turn it off. Here. The sounds of the orphans. Off. The psalms of the saints and sages. Off. The chanting of mantras. Off. You... You can see. You're looking. Yes, I am looking. Look. Look into my eyes. There's plenty you'll see in this mirror. Look. These are bottles. But they don't contain madam Leela's medicine. They're full of alcohol. Look some more. You're embracing madam Leela. In this mirror you will also see you are madam Leela's father. And you made love to your daughter. Boss! I wanted to spend my life in the shade of your trust. I worshipped like God. But you turned out to be the devil. You became this blind man's cane and struck him with it. Parker, the very thorn you sowed in the field of life... Let go! Let go of me! Please forgive me. I will never betray another blind person. You will betray again. You will deceive the entire world. But, Parker, how will you shut those eyes... that look at the entire world? Those who can see as well as the blind. No. Let me go. I will never do this to anyone. I promise. You're a liar and your promises are lies. I won't let you get away, Parker. You must be punished for your sins. This lifeless article has served me for a long time. Today I shall break a traitor's bones... with the help of this loyal friend. Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Parker! Oh God! This is your justice. I never foresaw these two ending this way. I'm crazy, doctor. I'm a murderer. Two murders were committed by me in this manner. Silly, from what you told me... it's apparent Parker suffered his own consequences. They reaped what they sowed. You are innocent, son. No law of the world or society will hold you culpable. Enough, doctor. My heart is broken now. I've come to you with a request today. Request? Please take my remaining wealth. I no longer have any need of it. I lost everything I had for this. - But... - Please don't refuse, doctor. Please accept it and use it for a good deed. - I'm leaving. - Where? Prayag, Kashi, wherever my eyes take me. Son, you're too young to go on pilgrimages. - Go to your village. - Village? To whose place do I go in the village, doctor? Basanti, Radha, uncle. Nobody is left. The plague took away the entire village from me. Plague? Who told you that? Parker and his compatriots. Son, how could you trust those sinners? I assure you, your Basanti, uncle... Radha and the entire village are safe and sound. This is another deception by those traitors. Doctor! You've opened my eyes once again. I'll go to the village today. I'll go now. You must go, son. But take one of my responsibilities with you. Responsibility? This mute nurse who served you day and night. She's like a daughter to me. She's going on a holiday. She lives near your village. Escort her to her destination when you get home, son. Very well, doctor. Your wish is my command. Come along, ma'am. Bless you, my girl. Come on. Everyone is alive. Everyone is alive. My village is inhabited. My village is inhabited. Basanti! 'We are coming. And do as I wrote to you, father.' 'Tell Radha not to tell him anything.' You understand, don't you? Don't say a word. Uncle, Chandan has arrived. - Chandan's arrived? - Yes. Quiet, quiet. Not a sound. Your sister is coming. Sakhiya, Makhan, Chandan has arrived. I'm Makhan, the blacksmith. Uncle Makhan. Mr. Chandan, I am Lakhiya the landlord. Lakhiya! You brought wealth from the city? Yes, brother. But the biggest wealth I gained is my eyes. I can see my village and villagers. Ramu's mother! - Chandan. - Uncle. Chandan. Please forgive me, uncle. The blind man lost his way home. I forgive you. Thank God you got your eyes. Guess who this is. Long live amputated leg. Radha! Uncle, where is Basanti? What did you say? Basanti. Didn't you bring her with you? With me? When was she ever with me? Don't say that, Chandan. You've regained your sight. Don't snatch an old man's light. She left for the city looking for you. She hasn't yet returned. Tell me. Tell me where my daughter is. But, uncle, I... - And who is this? - She's my nurse. I regained my eyesight because of her. She's no nurse. Sister, why are you troubling my brother? Remove the veil. - Basanti? - Yes, Chandan. Please forgive me. Lifetime partners don't apologize to one another. Where's the blind man? Let me take a look. Where's the blind man? So you're back. Basanti. Uncle, Basanti, too, has returned. Don't tarry now, uncle. Find a good date for the wedding. Yes, of course. Banwari, you were right. Basanti would marry a seeing man, not a blind man. Cheers to that. Uncle, Chandan has accepted it too. Absolutely correct. Banwari, Chandan isn't blind anymore. He can see. Banwari, I saw us run often when we were young. Will you run for me, my good man? Run! Run! Oh no! Damn you! Run! Long live amputated leg.
