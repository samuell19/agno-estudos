I suppose the state has lost interest in discovering anything further. Well, that's why we're here. SARTAIN: Michael has been my life's obsession. I've examined every single case file written on him. I was a student of Dr. Loomis before he passed away. And then I lobbied the University of Illinois to be assigned to Michael myself. Any progress? Well, he's been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists, and with each, many different opinions. Dr. Loomis was the only one to see him in the wild. And he concluded he was nothing more than pure evil. Our patients get fresh air, sunshine, a view, proper exercise, healthy diet. It pains me to see him transferred to that less-than-desirable facility. And there he is. He can speak. He just chooses not to. I'd love to stand closer to him, if I may. Get a sense of his awareness, or lack of awareness. Oh, make no mistake, he's aware. He was watching you as you arrived. Perhaps you'd like to tie your left shoelace? Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman with the umbrella, has a fixation for such things. Underestimate no one. Of course. And now step up to the yellow line. And no further. Do not cross the line under any circumstances. Michael. Michael. I've got some people who'd like to meet you. Hello, Michael. My name is Aaron Korey. I've been following your case for years and still know very little about you. I'd like to know more. About that night. About those involved. Do you ever think about them, Michael?

Aaron and I have made several award-winning public radio exposés. Our last project shed new light on a murder case from 20 years ago. We like to reexamine incidents with an unbiased lens. I believe there's a lot to learn from the horrors you experienced. There's nothing to learn. There are no new insights or discoveries. So, is he real? Who? The Boogeyman. I read you quoted... You don't believe in the Boogeyman? I believe in Michael Myers, deranged serial killer, but... the Boogeyman, no. Well, you should. Okay. Michael Myers is a human being who killed his sister when he was six years old. Then he came after you. We just want to know why. We want a glimpse inside his mind. That's why your story is so important. My story? AARON: Two failed marriages. Rocky relationship with your daughter and granddaughter. Michael Myers murdered five people. And he's a human being we need to understand? I'm twice divorced. And I'm a basket case. They're transferring him. Tomorrow, 7:00. He'll-he'll be locked away until the end of his days. That's the idea. Let's talk about when the state came to take your daughter away. She was 12 years old. They said you were an unfit mother. How long until you regained custody? I didn't. But you already knew that. Laurie, we saw him. We met with Michael. I showed him the mask. There was nothing. No response. Nothing. He won't talk to anyone. Never has, but... I think he might speak with you. So, why don't you sit down with him and say all the things you must be longing to say. Come with us, and let us help you free yourself. Please. LAURIE: Time's up.

She just tries to keep me away from her. Everyone in my family, like, turns into a total nutcase this time of year. If I were you guys, I wouldn't celebrate, either. I would just put up a Christmas tree instead. Just skip all over the creepy Halloween shit, right? Does your grandma ever talk about it? Yeah, it's pretty much all she talks about. It defines her life. She's been traumatized ever since. Wasn't it her brother who, like, cold-blooded murdilated all those teenagers? No. That's just a bit that some people made up to make them feel better, I think. I mean, that is scary to have a bunch of your friends get butchered by some random crazy person. Is it, though? Because, all things considered, there's a lot worse stuff that's happening today. And, like, I mean, what, a couple people getting killed by one guy with a knife is not that big of a deal.

I'll save it for college, then. Fuck college. Go somewhere. Go to Mexico. Could you imagine? Yeah, I can. Look, don't worry about your mom. She will freak. But she'll get over it. Why can't you? The Boogeyman? All this hiding, all this preparation, it was for nothing. I mean, it took priority over your family. It cost you your family.
