In the time of the Great Sea pirate The oceans are filled with men with ambitions for wealth, fame and power It's a dream for a pirate But some of them just like to plunder For the weak these are times of endless persecution Despite being under the jurisdiction of a world government the navy was powerless to protect the weak So who can they rely on and what can they do to be saved? We really don't have a choice no one cares about people like us All I can do is cry... That's what everyone says. Pirates are bad guys. And worse... I'm so hungry What are we supposed to do when the pirates have taken everything Yeah, it's all because of the pirates All because those selfish brutes took our joy Do you understand now? I'm begging you to do something about our unfortunate situation, okay Only you only you can help us I beg you You're the only one who can help us I beg you Just you Please, please, please I know, I know I will create a new era for you that will make us all happy Where are our seats? I'd like to buy some peripheral products What a long dragon I have to go to the bathroom later. Oh, my God, your seat has food Yeah because it's a platinum ticket There must be a lot of people here Because it was Uta's first time singing live in front of fans Until now, we've only seen her in the telephony bug To see Uta live in such a beautiful place, I really... Mermaids are coming. It looks like it's gonna be fun. But why are we dressed like this It's to make her sing better and then someone in costume can get these I see I'm looking forward to it After all, she's the most loved person in the world right now Is she really that great? As the King of Souls, I don't normally say that But the songs she sings really seem from another world Uta, Uta, I love... That's boring. What? Damn swordsman You come back here and say it again if you dare and I'll fry you till you're juicy Try it on me, Curly Here we go The concert started with Luffy "We choose our own future." "Try a new path." "If I change the world..." "Say goodbye to all those who oppose us." "No one has the power to stop the change that music can bring." "You can't stop the magic." "Close your eyes and you can see the future right in front of you." "Every word I sing leads you closer to your destiny." "When you get there don't let go." "If you want to play a real game, untie the chains." "When the melody is strung we are walking on a tight rope." "Don't want to cry don't want to try to forget" "Let me live in this dream." "I want to be free." "I want to be free" "And then embrace the new era." "I know we can do this." "Create a new world." "We choose our own future." "Try to take a new path." "If I change the world" "This infinite music can be transformative." "Let the message in the song" "Go further." "This dream will come true." "I believe you" "Say goodbye to everything that's holding you down." "Let colorful music take you away from reality." "We have to move on." "Close your eyes, hold my hand and let's run." "We don't need to live like this. I know we can do better." "I sing for freedom." "If you want to play a real game, untie the chains." "Let the melody light the way for new vistas." "Don't want to cry don't want to try to forget" "Let me live in this dream." "I want to be free" "And then embrace the new era." "I know we can do this." "Create a new world." "We choose our own future" "Try a new path." "If I change the world" "This infinite music can be transformative." "Let the message in the song" "Go further." "This is the new era." "This is the new era." 'This is the new era' Hi, it's nice to finally meet you. I'm Uta I'm sorry I'm a little moved I'm sorry I'm a little moved Uta we love you Uta we love you Uta loves you... Everybody, let's play together today Are you guys ready? Ready to go Wealth and fame will be ours if we can kidnap the star Sorry Uta Uta, Uta Feeding Luffy What? Did he try to kidnap her too? Oh, it's you Uta, are you right It's me. Who is it? Is it Luffy? Is it Luffy? Long time no see Uta Luffy That straw hat... Isn't he the fifth starbelt on the sea? Really? How could Uta be friends with a sea pirate? Does Luffy know Uta? If that guy really knew me at least he introduced me to Uta Why are you friends with Princess Uta? Why? Why? That's because she's Shanks's daughter Isn't Shanks just... One of the four Kings of a district evil villain? I remember it a long time ago He's the same seafarer who attacked Eligia uttar I was wondering what to do when I heard the concert was in Eligia... You mean the legend Yeah, but I didn't think the bigger news would get out What do you want? The fourth sea emperor, the red-headed Shanks, had a daughter If that's true you're a redhead's biggest weakness If we turn you over to some other powerful Hai Fu, we'll make a lot of money So it's a shame that today's concert has been canceled Hot air fist Come out That girl is ours now Are you... Which branch branch? I'm Borichun from BIG MOM, The Pirates Who was standing next to her I'm BIG MOM Charlotte Lingling's fourth son. Owen looks fun. Let me join in Actually, I just came by to see what's going on and what's so interesting about this place Uta, I'm sorry I have to take you home to make a letter for Mom Wait a minute it doesn't matter Hey, you bastards are gonna have to beat me if you're gonna take Uta We can't let these bastards ruin that beautiful stage It's finally getting more interesting Don't underestimate our ice Mother pirates The song of blowing snow cut Jellyfish fist What a shame The concert just started Come and protect Uta Rubber machine gun Rubber machine gun Spider flower Come on Okay, time out Luffy and everyone thanks for protecting me but no more fighting Now that you're all my fans, you should get along and enjoy the concert But Princess Uta these men tried to kidnap you did you know that And people like you don't listen to you If we want something we will not fight for it or get it back. We are pirates All right, Pirates I forgive you for the bad things you've done So does everyone else stop being a bad sea pirate and join me in making the world a better place With my song everyone can live in peace and be happy There is no such thing as peace in this world or I'll tear the face off this stupid kid You don't mess with her. She's my prize Guys, aren't you here to enjoy my music? Don't forget we're pirates We got more important things to do first than your song We rarely come here to see a concert To hurt our feelings and Uta's feelings like that Too bad then let me write a song "You don't need to worry from now on." "There's no need to fret."" "Your dream is our dream is what each and every one of you wants." "As soon as you start singing your heart will become as clear as the sky." "Don't worry. " "I am the strongest" "My Song" "Makes the birds fly high in the sky. " "Even the clothes that flutter in the wind." "Rock like a dancer too." "Your voice" "Let me rejoice." "If you accidentally get hurt." "Come on, come on, let me protect you." "A new landscape that I've never seen before." "We can definitely see it." "If you want to talk about why." "Well, just because we're alive." "Come on, let's hold hands." "Go where the light shines." "Everybody's dream." "It is my happiness." "Not anywhere." "Only you have it." "That softness" "Make me stronger." "I'm the strongest when you're with me" Guys those bad pirates have turned into a song It's safe now so don't worry It's safe now so don't worry Yeah, well, they may be father and daughter but Shanks and Uta are different That's great You're getting so tough, Uta I wonder if she ate some demon fruit I don't know. I've never heard of it What is this? What are you doing We're going back I have some good news for you I used to rely on the telephony bug all the time and it made me feel tired The live stream will be over soon but this time the concert is endless and it will go on forever what Yeah, it means I can be with you forever For those of you watching and those of you watching let's keep having fun That's impressive. She's going ahead with her own concert That's amazing Uta... One more thing and this is very important The entire Navy and the governments of the world ask you not to interfere with my concert Everyone is looking for fun and fun and you'd better be prepared if you go overboard I am Uta who will create a new era and I will make people happy with my songs All right, our next song Redhead actually has a daughter as Cipher Pol reports A new enemy has emerged against the age of the Great Sea pirate It's complicated because a lot of people are supportive of her We need to kill this revolution before it's too late Is that girl really Friend's daughter The presence of Tol Musica is also worrying If it wakes up again be prepared we may not be able to defeat it Yeah, the authorities have decided to arrest Uta and she's dangerous It's weird that the whole world is watching when she's just a girl Hey, are you underestimating her She's on the Island of Eligia Music That's where Tot Musica was sealed long ago So how many people are you going to send How many ships do we have right now to get to Eligia? Thirty ships Take all the companies and teams and send out all the ships If the phone bug can't use the flagship command will use the flag signal to send out the signal thin code 044 every ship should know Captain turn around follow the signal and cooperate with the others Don't rush but be prepared don't be lazy turn around quickly The airflow meter measures a level 4 breeze with long waves on the water and lots of white waves Attention Every ship Every ship must assemble their gunners and check every cannon Make sure there are no cracks in the cannon and make sure there are no holes in the ignition and check the wheels No moving boats were detected in the vicinity There are no obstacles in sight and every boat is in perfect condition and ready to sail Are you hungry? Let me cook the good food and the fun stuff That's impressive. Can I really do this? Of course, Guys here you can eat anything you want and sing and dance and play with me whenever you want, okay It's like a dream... Every dream will come true if you stay with me and there's nothing here that scares you The new era is the best! She's more capable than we thought. Are we underestimating her Mom Mom is more than just ability turns out she is the daughter of red hair Mom Mom is more than just ability turns out she is the daughter of red hair We're gonna get her And those straw hat assholes are gonna hate it too and I'd love to see them beat me Let me go to Eligia I can't just lose my sister and stand by This place is a chef's paradise If you ask Uta, she might still be able to make wine Yeah, Uta has access to unlimited treasure What kind of power is that She's pretty strong for a demon fruit user Yeah, I've never heard of anyone with that kind of invincibility Luffy, aren't you Uta's friend or do you know something? She has always been a good singer what Someone may have given Uta this ability Maybe that person is the god of music... Hey, Luffy, did you guys have a good time Very happy Princess Uta Very happy Princess Uta You have so many rare ingredients and this place is heaven It's so much fun here I'm glad Luffy's friends are so happy Hello? Is everyone here Yes. If you believe me, this hat is... I'm not lying to you Luffy, let's have a race You can't beat me right now What are you talking about that I've needed a meeting 83 times Are you wrong? I'm the one who won 183 in a row The two views are completely different What competition? Luffy and I used to have all kinds of competitions like knife throwing and arm wrestling and all that Come on and make this the event of the day The fastest chicken eater wins Oh, I miss this and what else Don't worry. I'm ready Come on, get in position start Wow, thank you. Uta won. She won Not fair Uta Do not fall into the sea By the way, Luffy ate the devil fruit, didn't he? I'm sorry You just broke the rules. Do it again There you go again with the sore loser I won, so you're gonna tell me where Shanks is I don't know So what happened to your straw hat and now I'm keeping it Hey, how do you two know each other? That's when she came to Faucha with Shanks and the others Fosha Village is your hometown, isn't it, Luffy Yes. 12 years ago... Uta, you're daydreaming again Come on over Don't be boring. Let's have a race You are so childish. What are you competing against Chicken Eating Contest wang Whoever eats the fastest wins, okay good This is too dangerous for you two to fight No way. Uta Luffy Let them compete It was an important match for both of them Come on To prepare Three two one What are they competing for Let's see who turns out to be a great sea pirate Will Luffy win You can have my juice. Yes, thank you luffy I can't believe you fell for the same trick again Are you okay? The competition... The game is not over yet There you go again with the sore loser You cheated you're supposed to be the sore loser I'm a sea pirate. I'm not cheating. You're just a kid letting your guard down in a fair game Shanks doesn't even think you're a pirate yet Shut up. I'm Shanks 'daughter Unlike you, I've gone on many adventures with him on boats and I'm in a different league than you No, it is Then come and fight me like a sea pirate Sure. That's enough of you two You hit a child with a knife that's against the rules of sea thieving Shanks Silly boy this is called love deep responsibility You don't get love when it's a knife Do you really love me I love you, too, Shanks Shanks You two don't look around me and neither do Uta and Luffy Why do you call your father Shanks He's my dad but he's also my captain and he's cool, right Now that I won Luffy today I'm in a good mood so I'm gonna sing a song Shanks, I'm going out to sea We don't need violent kids like you Then why does Uta get to go She'll take care of our ship while we're fighting but you can't Yes. I'm Gojiuta from the Red-headed One Pirates I am a girl who makes music for a new era where all people can enjoy freedom All right, it's time to welcome our Goliath "Where is this wind coming from and where is it taking us?" "I looked to the sky for answers but it didn't answer me." "Where is this song that I'm singing going to go?" "I try to find the answer inside." "Once more we are bravely heading out into the unknown sea." "I have only one wish" Good enough for me to sing Yeah, go ahead and sing. Yeah Now that I think about it, it's like you just disappeared Suddenly? What happened? If I remember correctly I waited for Shanks and the others every single time But one day... Welcome back. Do you have any adventure stories to share today? What's wrong with you guys? You know what? I'll ask Uta Uta? I want to hear about your adventures Where are you, Uta Where is Shanks-uta Did something happen to Uta? Don't worry Luffy Uta left our ship to become a singer And just like that... So Uta why don't you want to be a pirate? You used to love red-headed One pirate so much Instead of being a pirate I just decided to be a singer! Look, I've got fans all over the world in two years What about you, Luffy? What are you doing now? Do you have to ask? I'm a sea pirate To a sea pirate Yeah, I want to be One Piece Don't be a sea pirate, Luffy Let's live happily here together All of your friends are my fans It would be fun if we were all together Wait a minute. Are you listening? Luffy Uta It's nice to see you again and I'm full so I'm going back to the Thousand SUNS to sleep now You look like you're doing what you want I'm happy for you. Goodbye I won't let you go Luffy and all of you must stay here forever and be happy with me What are you talking about, shorty Uta we love your music but we can't stay here forever Her beauty Guys, I found some more pirates. What am I supposed to do? Uta... Uta... Good! Let me defeat these pirates for your sake I don't care if she's a friend of Luffy's that's too much freedom What are these things There are more and more of them Tang Cao Wa is boxing Sore fingers luffy You shouldn't be a sea pirate If you're my friend, give up being a sea pirate What are you talking about? I gave it up. It was boring I have no reason to fight you I'm gonna keep fighting even if you don't do anything Six rounds of flowers. Slap in the face Stop playing uta "Sad memories are like passing through sorrow." "Can't let go of the resentment and the gloom in my heart." "Because of him." "You have no idea, do you? The heartbreaking loneliness." "Now is the time to unbind." "Anger, right now." "Blow these bad guys out of the sky. This is the punishment of love. I don't want to sleep anymore." "There's no more sadness, there's no more sadness." "Yeah, anger. Right now." "Kick the bad guy in the air. That's the punishment of love. I don't want to sleep anymore." "Don't feel lonely no lonely backlight ah" What the hell are you doing Let go of me Luffy can't be One Piece Hey, guys, what do you think about pirates My city was destroyed by pirates My husband was killed by a pirate Give me back my mother Don't let a pirate drive away a pirate Princess Luffy Uta did none of those things Uta, my friend You stay away from Uta you pirates You are a demon fruit user who will weaken in the sea and we will not fear you Hey, no. We're screwed. Wait a minute It's gonna be okay. Let's just see what happens, okay Ball of protection Lomeo Uta is really running wild and I don't think we can beat her I haven't... Lose, There you go again with the sore loser They're gone. Where did they go? The pirate escaped There are even hidden pirates What? Where are we? Are you a Uta fan too, Trafalgar? No, I'm just going along I'm here to keep paypal company Excuse me Thank you very much! This is no time to laugh, straw hat boy If we can't figure out what that girl's powers are... Leave it to me because I've beaten her 184 times in a row There you are! There you are. Luffy senior Uta baby captain Let's go The sea pirate escaped Let's go get them together SWORD's phone bug hasn't been working Well, that's too bad it looks like Uta's really gonna go through with her plan SWORD has been watching Uta, too Aren't you from Cipher Pol What are they trying to do? Isn't it time for a turf war where you can't use your doorfruit abilities Maybe you know too much And so do you. I could but it's gonna take a lot of energy out of me So what do we do Gather our men first that's all we can do right now It's a headache. They got caught It looks like they're just stuck to that rope so they'll be fine I didn't think that one day I could take the road to fly away I was so moved that I couldn't see the front straw hat boy thank you What are you doing, please Wow, that's a lot. We'll be surrounded if we keep this up Here you go. It's a good thing you saved us You said you were Luffy, right Yes. And you? Who are you I was king of the kingdom of Eligia My name was Gordon What kingdom has some buildings but no people You're wrong. Eligia was once the number one music island in the world But it all disappeared overnight A kingdom that big just disappeared in one night There's a rumor that they were attacked by pirates Let's talk about Uta When Eligia was empty I'm the one who raised Uta Are you? It's just the two of us on this island She's supposed to feel very alone and she's pretending to be strong for me But when she's alone she sings about her friends "I think of us playing by the sea." "Just you and me." "But the smell of the sea is fading away." "Slowly slipping away" "So I sang a familiar song "Hope you can hear me." "I'll sing till you come back to me." To encourage Uta I made her the best singer in the world Hello? Are you listening? Just go ahead and ignore us I'm sorry Anyway, Uta doesn't seem to have any idea what Luffy's doing, does he? I'm sorry My problem at that time was that I didn't know when and how to deliver her songs to the world After all, she grew up without knowing anything about the outside world But the timing was sudden She happened to pick one up two years ago The new image of the phone bug washes ashore Uta was liberated to broadcast her music to the outside world Her fans love her voice It's as if the sound she transmits is all around the world Thank you, Uta I feel much better Thank you Uta because you're the reason I'm alive Me too. I'm glad people are so happy... A new consciousness had sprung up within her that the age of the Great pirate was full of war and violence It was meant to be heard by others But somewhere along the way, more and more of Uta's fans started calling her the savior And Uta just... I understand your feelings very well If you want me to do it a new era Please stop Uta's plan Luffy, you're her friend and I know you can do it Is that the concert you're talking about? I'm sorry paypal Ah cho The paypal Bear utta Uta, why did you leave Shanks's ship I thought you said you wanted to be the Gorgie of the Red-headed One Piece and go back to Shanks Shut up. I don't want to talk about it Forget all this boring stuff We can eat delicious food and play chicken contests and arm wrestle and live happily as before Give me my hat back Shanks 'hat Well, Luffy New Era doesn't need you ROOM migration Where did they go? Did the pirates escape? Looks like they have a lot of different abilities Forget it let's just make a game of it and find the escaped pirates Let me out. I want my hat back Shut up You can't do that That's why I put you in here We just kept running... There's a harbor on the other side of the island. Let's go that way What port? The Navy and the secret Service were at the concert What are you talking about Governments and navies around the world are watching Uta's capabilities They watched her as if she were dangerous So they're here to scout I think they're somewhere around the island If we can find the Navy we can find a way to get them to give us some Intel on Utta's capabilities Not over there Oops Don't worry, my ball shield is pretty strong But it won't stop It's so tall. Luffy senior hold on, hold on Gordon are you still mad at me for throwing this concert without consulting you? It's not an easy concert, is it I see you found out that you're on my side, right I... I... It would have been easy for you to just run away I don't want you to do this But... You just stay here for the time being The governments and navies of the world will not stand idly by It doesn't matter because I have this This is Tol Musica I always knew it was buried under this castle. Why didn't you throw it away? Isn't it because you have new age ideals, too? Uta you can't use it uttar Ah Autumn... This ocean is so vast Forget the Navy there's not a soul here Let me ask you something. What's going on? The Thousand Yang is gone Is it your boat The regionalization what A thousand Yang, a thousand Yang Really? Are you really a thousand SUNS Is that Uta's power again? I'm going crazy The regionalization Report to the forward deck lookout No enemy duplication was found No enemy was found Watch the back of the ship for any raids Prepare for land battle Deploy the first squadron to make sure the beaches are secure as soon as they arrive The second team entered the island when the beach was secured Armed Recon 2 continues its search with no sign of the enemy Armed Recon Three is in and there's no sign of the enemy We continued to advance but could not confirm any sign of the enemy or what looked like the enemy Waiting for the next command This is... What is this... This is Armed Recon Seven We have no information on the people of Eligia This is Armed Recon two and we have no sign of the enemy This is Armed Recon Four reporting to Lieutenant Ratty The audience is not awake and can't wake up Repeat they can't wake up I don't think they're dead They just fell asleep But they're never gonna get up If you kill me these souls will never return Is that okay The little girl I know all too well what your demon fruit can do Then you don't need me to explain, do you? Go home After all, I'll be gone soon Am I getting a wakeful mushroom What are wakeful mushrooms People who eat these mushrooms can't sleep and die from exhaustion What are you... Are you going to kill yourself and take the whole audience with you? What? Your soul is more important than your body, isn't it? In the new age every soul will live forever I'm trying to solve this problem without violence if you could just drop it Stop your plan to destroy the world What are you talking about? I just want people to be happy It seems you don't want to listen to our advice So are you Don't worry You can't do anything to me as long as we can't hear you Unfortunately, it was too late What do you mean, General Kirby Guys, there are bad guys here Let's get them for the new era Don't hurt them they're just innocent citizens being controlled "I've given up being alone. I want to be with someone else." "I want a real relationship so let me take my feelings" "Sing it all out (shout it out)" "Listen, baby, I'm gonna make you happy whether you like it or not." "Sneak up on you, keep you from escaping and wait for the beat." "Listen to the surprise every word will bring you to me." "(Oh) Be my sweet little boy and girl." "Do you think you're good but I'm tired of it?" "I got something better here. Come on. We can sing together." "Let's unpack the fun and get on stage together. Let's go." "(Aha) I want to make you happy." "Do it proudly with me." "(Hey) Tell me is it hard to live here?" "Isn't this the country of our dreams?" "It's been on the way a long time. It's time to stay. You can't deny it." "It's a miracle of mercy that you can't stop even if you try to stop it." "I don't think that's too much to wish for." "The Savior has come to this age." "I screamed for salvation." "Because no one ever heard me scream." "But that's not true anymore." "I have to do this. They can't do it anymore." "Stop me and get out of my way." "There's no going back now let's sing together forever." "Let the bass rock your head and the drums break your eardrums." "Let those brass instruments touch your heart." "Let me hear you scream oh wow!" "Don't be brainwashed into telling the truth." "Let me erase all traces of your brainwashing and stop listening to their lies." "Look up and let my song bring back your consciousness that's what you need." "This is my real voice." Damn it This is bad I can't get out of here This is so useless with your curly eyebrows You can't get down either, you mossy head So can Fledge and Jiping move I can't move I'm Brooke, too Let's try again Can you break free? I was so close to seeing Nami's underwear what? If you see that, I'll blow you out of the sky Can I say something Didn't Uta say, "Let me create a song" I don't think that means it's a sheet music It does look like a melody The position of our head may be a note Brooke, can you sing it? But I can't see the whole score All I can see now is... You shut up and don't look at your underwear Sure enough, the Straw Hat Pirates were able to discover that it was a musical score what? You guys... Why with Bruno? I'll explain that later Come on, sing The mi to Here we go. Free to go Good Brooke go ahead Did you hear about that girl's power Did you put my sister in a bag The elder brother Just this once but only if you cooperate with the Navy Mia Ah Cho Do I... The mi... Thank you. You really are a very capable bear Hello hello Why?... I'm in here again... We don't know what Uta is capable of so we can't let you out A thousand SUNS... A thousand SUNS? Why are you guys here Long time no see Luffy Kirby helped me get me out of here How did you know to come here? I sensed Luffy The original is used to see color domineering And then I borrowed Bruno's doorfruit power Door door let me out Cipher Pol is working with the Navy What's going on here? Everybody wants to know what Uta can do, right You know what Uta is capable of... what You may not believe this but the world we live in isn't real what What you see is not reality The world Uta created with her powers The ability to sing fruit allows the singer to transport the soul of the person who hears the song to sing about the world The souls that are transported will feel like they're still alive But not in the real world but in the world Uta created It's like everyone's having the same dream I think Uta said she could do it what? I mean when someone hears her sing they go to sleep If you knew why didn't you say so Sorry, I forgot. So what's going on in the real world? Our bodies stay in the real world But they're all controlled by Uta So how do we get back to reality? If Uta falls asleep her powers will be taken away But because we've been trapped in this world of singing fruit we can't lay a hand on the real Uta The devil fruit has to have its limits, right Yes. It takes a lot of energy to maintain this world of singing fruit It's like I can't use my door fruit ability all the time So all it takes is Uta to get tired and go to sleep Well, that's a conundrum because I confirmed that she ate sober mushrooms before her concert even started That mushroom will keep you awake The real world Uta will soon be dead To die? Is Uta going to die? Can we get out of here if she's dead? No, it's the opposite If Uta dies the world will shut down Everyone in here will be there Including us would be stuck here Her fans would be trapped forever in this world of singing fruit This is Uta's plan It's crazy Kirby How are we gonna stop Uta I snuck in here to find her weakness and I didn't find anything, you know I just knew we had to at least get our people together so I got Hilumebo working with the other Pirates As for the Straw Hat Pirates they have their own operation Looks like they're all right They headed for the castle of Eligia Nicole Robin seems to know what happened to this island in the past If there were records we might have a way to beat Uta But the chances are slim Can you trust Robin you mossy white head? It's a fact you have beautiful eyebrows There is a room with many books Guys let's forget about the sea pirate and wait for a new era How long before the real Uta dies? Less than two hours The sound insulation here is well done Looks like Uta can't reach this place The Navy says she's safe where her voice can't be heard Are these old records? How are we gonna find what we need? Three knife flow extremely tiger hunting Demon wind foot Fried assorted platter Strong right hand weapon left hand Robin, you go find that book But Robin I won't let them hurt a hair on your head Don't worry Very quickly... The bad guys will disappear and a new era will dawn Can you hear me? Uta probably has an hour to live, Max But those phone bugs with their souls are out of control They keep showing videos of Uta singing about the fruit world "It's dangerous if you don't turn the sound off and your soul is taken away as soon as you hear that song." "Listen, baby, I'm gonna make you happy whether you like it or not." "Snuck up on you, didn't let you run and waited for the beat." "Listen to the surprise every word will lead you to me." "Be my sweet little boy and girl." "Do you think you're good but I'm tired of it?" "I got something better here." "Come on we can sing it out" "Let's get on the stage. Let's go."" Uta's concert has been going on for over six hours The number of victims continues to grow If this goes on for one more hour, 70% of the population will be teleporting to the world of singing fruit Seventy percent? That's more than we thought The world is going to be wiped out We have to do something to stop her, okay I told you that stuff doesn't work here If I can't use you then I don't need you What are you doing?
