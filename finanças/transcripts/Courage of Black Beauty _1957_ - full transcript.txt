There, Lady Ellen, easy. I'm sorry I couldn't get over any sooner, Mr. Adams. It's not as urgent as I had hoped. - Boyd, that's your name? - That's right. That's a beautiful animal. That's Mr. O'Banion. Well, he might be, uh, very high-strung. As a matter of fact, he has a wild strain in him. He's more restless than usual today. I... I guess he knows he's about to become a father. And how's the mare doing? Lady Ellen? She's fine. - She's not ready to foal? - She has to be. What do you mean, "has to be"? From the way I figured, it should have happened two days ago. You can't hurry nature, Mr. Adams. Not a little bit? Not even a little bit. You see, my son's on his way home. Well, is Lady Ellen his mare? Oh, no, but today is the boy's birthday, and I'm giving him the newborn colt. I hope it'll all work out. It has to. I want this to be the surprise of his life. I'll do all I can. You know how boys are. Wouldn't be the same if I gave him a colt that wasn't born yet. I understand. Bobby's always been crazy about Lady Ellen. He's been living with his grandmother, but he's coming back home to stay. I think it's important for a man to be close to his only son, don't you? Yes, I do. Very important. - Hi, Chuck. - Hello, Mike. - Fill her up for me, would you? - You betcha. I never saw you so quiet. I'm thinking. Have a good time at your grandmother's? Sorta. Well, are you glad that school's over? Sorta. But nobody's really glad to say good-bye to their friends. But you have friends here. Like Lily Rowden? Hey, now, Lily's a very nice girl. And beside, Mr. O'Banion and Lady Ellen. Of course. They're real friends. Animals beat girls anytime. I thought I was your friend, too. You are, Mike. What about your dad? Why didn't he meet me? Ah, so, that's it. You know, if you want to know, your dad's working on something very special for you. What is it? Just you wait and see. Well, you've got to do something before he gets here. I'm sorry. There's nothing anyone can do but wait. Check your oil and water? No, not today Chuck. He's gonna be here any minute. How am I gonna keep him away from Lady Ellen? You'll think of something. Now, let's calm down. - So long. - So long. Think it'll be much longer? It will be another two hours or more. Oh, no. Why don't you ask Mrs. Adams to keep the boy occupied until the colt is born? Well, there isn't any Mrs. Adams. Bobby's mother passed away four years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Now, whatever I tell him, you back me up. All right. I think I'll have another look at Lady Ellen. Hi, son. - Hi! - Happy birthday. Thanks, Dad. Is something wrong with Lady Ellen? - Oh, just a slight cold. - I'll say hello to her. The vet's treating her now. You better wait a bit. There's your old friend, Mr. O'Banion. Hi, Mr. O'Banion. How are you today? No colt? Nothing's happened. Oh, why don't you tell him? Now let me do this my way. Sure is great to see you. Well, he's... he's pretty upset. He's upset? He feels badly because you didn't pick him up. Does he know what I've been going through? He would if you told him. That's a good boy. Gee, Mr. O'Banion looks great. Yeah, he sure does. Son, why don't you go to your room and get unpacked? Let me show you what grandma gave me for my birthday. Look! Hey, that's a beauty, Bobby. Why, that's great. Yeah, that's nice. Wait till you see what it can do. Well, not now, Bobby. Later. Maybe this afternoon. But, Dad, it'll only take a few minutes. I want you to get your clothes off first and get your things unpacked. Dad. Dad! I don't think it'll be too long now. Well, thank goodness. There, there, Lady Ellen. Easy, girl. Whoa, easy. - Easy, girl. Easy, easy. - Easy, girl. There, there. Easy. That's good. I don't believe a word of it. A little plane like that can't fly. You're just pulling my leg. Wanna bet? Bobby, did you know that horses once used to fly? Oh, cut it out. Did you ever hear of Pegasus? Pegasus? Flew around in the sky all by himself, long before men ever flew. A horse? A flying horse. It carried Muhammad to the seventh heaven. For sure, the air was full of flying horses long before a man ever thought to walk on his two hind legs. You're kidding. They've been writing about it for hundreds of years. Why did they stop flying? Well, now, you see, when the good Lord realized that He'd given man everything but horse sense, He took the horses' wings away and ordered them to help man travel the long and troublesome roads of the earth. Well, now we have automobiles. Sure, and what's in their engines? Horsepower. Mike! Easy, easy. That's good. Mike? That's a fine groom I got. He isn't even here at a time like this. But now, this little thing, it's too flippity-chippity to fly. It is not. Well, we'll see. - Where have you been? - I've been out with Bobby. But you knew Lady Ellen was about to give birth. Sure, mares have been foaling for a million years with scarcely any fuss at all. - Will you get me some water? - All right. What's that? Whatever it is, it's frightening her. Bobby! Look, Dad, it flies like a real plane! Easy, girl, easy. Easy, now. You're scaring Lady Ellen. Bobby, bring that thing down. You're scaring Lady Ellen half out of her wits. Bobby! Dad, no, it'll crash! Keep away from that stall! I just wanted to see how badly it was damaged. I don't know how you acted with your grandmother, but with me, you're gonna learn to obey. Yes, sir. You know what we do with an unruly horse? I'm not a horse. I'm a boy. Lady Ellen, you have a fine son. Bobby? Bobby, I'm talking to you. Come here. I've got something I wanna show you. How do you like him? He's funny-looking. He's yours, son, for your birthday. I don't want him. I don't understand Bobby. He always loved horses. Well, he still does. I guess I don't know much about boys, Mike. Yeah, that makes two of us. Now, with horses, well, there's something else you got. If they know what you want, they'll do it. But if they don't know what you want, well, they'll get confused. When you punish them for getting confused, they'll turn mean in self-defense. - Isn't that right, Mr. Boyd? - He's right. I've never seen a horse yet that didn't get his bad manners from a man. Or a boy either, is that what you two are trying to tell me? Well, I'd like to see how you'd handle him if he were your son. Well, I... I'll give the young'un a rubdown. I'd better be going. You've done find a job. Thanks. Thank you. Hi, Ann. We just had the blessed event. - Oh, boy or girl? - Boy. May I see him, please? May I see him? Sure, you can. Stay, Mike, stay. Oh, isn't he cute? Just look at him. - Gee, can I go in? - Oh, sure. Go on in. Did you ever see anything as darling as this, ever? That's the way I'd hoped Bobby would react. - Well, didn't he like him? - He said he was funny-looking. Where's Bobby? He's in his room. Come in. Hi. Hi. Is that all you can say? It's all you said. Aren't you glad to see me? Cheers. What's wrong? Everything. Why aren't you unpacking? Maybe I'm not going to. Not going to unpack? You mean, you're going back to your grandmother's? No. Then, where are you going? You're too young to run away. I'm too what? Do you know how old I am today? Ten. Well, then, stop talking crazy. I don't understand that boy. Well, I'm sure he doesn't understand you. Now, if he were my child... Ann, you don't raise a boy the same as you do a girl. What both you boys need around here is a woman. Like the woman next door, for instance? Did I say me? Then, we could combine our two ranches and have one king-sized ranch. Careful, I might hold you to that. Let me go with you. Sure. We'll take our horses. That's all you and my dad ever think about, horses. You've had a fight with you dad. It wasn't exactly a fight. We just don't get along, that's all. I'll bet you think he likes horses better than he does you. I didn't say that. Well, you practically did. I wouldn't say it or think it. Even if he did, he probably likes lots of things. More than he does you? You get out of here. That's it, isn't it? That's why you're running away. Will you beat it? Well, what do you think of him? I'll tell you six months or a year from now. I'd sure like to own him. I don't know. He seems all right, but I wouldn't take a chance on him. We can't overlook that wild streak in Mr. O'Banion. And the colt could inherit that wildness. Well, I'll gamble on it, Ben, wild blood and all. Well, only time will tell. I got work to do. That's some ranch boss you've got. Ben Farraday knows more about horses than any foreman around here. Well, I'm afraid Mike wouldn't agree with you. Where's Bobby? I left him in his room. We're going into town Can we get you anything? No, thanks. Stay, Mike. Stay, Mike. Bye, now. - Bye! - Bye-bye. Now, you're beginning to look handsome. Hi. Came to go get my plane. Well, you wouldn't leave without saying good-bye. Come in a minute. I've made up my mind. I'm not staying. Come over here, Bobby. I want you to take a good look at him. Not so funny-looking now, is he? I didn't mean to say that. See that straight-dropped hind leg? That's a sign of speed. It is? Look at that wide brisket. Yeah. He's really built. Well, the long neck and the powerful flanks, they mark the O'Banion in him. Now, you'll have to admit, Bobby, he's a great little horse. Well... I guess I better be going now. - Bobby intends to run away. - What? Lily didn't tell me till we were halfway to town. He thinks you don't want him around. Well, where'd he get that idea? The male is usually clumsy with its young. Mr. O'Banion loves that colt just as much as Lady Ellen. But if he tried to take care of him, oh, why, the poor little tyke would be all battered and bruised. Bobby! Bobby! Stay, Mike, stay. We're gonna be real good friends. You'll see. And nobody will ever hurt you, ever. Isn't he beautiful? So shiny and black. A black beauty, that's what he is. Hey, why can't I call him that? Black Beauty. How is that for a name, Dad? That's just excellent, son. I never had such a good birthday present as Black Beauty, not one. Here, Beauty! Come here, Black Beauty. Come here, Black Beauty. Stop yelling. Can't you see I'm training him? When he grows up, he'll be the smartest horse in the whole world. What can he do so far? Plenty. What did you teach him this morning? How to eat sugar out of my hand. Oh, he'll do that for anybody. Oh, no, he won't. Oh, yes, he will. I just wanna show you, smarty. Give me a piece of sugar. Lily, stay away from that colt. Come over here. You know you're supposed to stay on this side of the corral fence. I just want to show Bobby that Black Beauty will eat sugar out of my hand as well as his. You stay away from that colt if you don't wanna get hurt. Oh, he wouldn't hurt anyone. What do you think of him now, Ben? Oh, he's coming along all right, but I'd still say he could grow up to be mean horse. Oh, what could anyone possibly have against a young fellow like that? I still say he needs special training. Bobby is doing that. With sugar cubes? And with the love that goes along with them. You know, gentle care will work miracles on any animal, Ben. Mike, that's where you and I disagree. Come on, dear. Bobby, tell your father we'll see him later. Yes, ma'am. Don't worry about Mr. Farraday. I'll give you all the training you need. That you will, laddie. But he's got a bit of growing up to do. We'll show 'em, Beauty. Come on. Let's all salute the world's most gracious lady. Hear, hear. Yay! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You're forgetting about the gifts. Well, that was to be a surprise. Are you all ready? Yeah! Well, it's locked now, but the first person who can, um, give me the name of the man responsible for establishing the famous breed of Morgan horses wins the privilege of presenting the gifts. That's easy, Mr. Morgan. You are right, and here's the key. Mr. Michael Green. That's me. Thank you, sir. Miss Mary Carter. Thanks, Bobby. Mr. Sam Adams and Mr. Ben Farraday. Thank you, son. Uh, Lily Rowden. You're supposed to say, "Miss Lily Rowden." Isn't that lovely? Oh, a beautiful pair of riding boots! Where's yours, Bobby? I'm saving mine for last. Gee, thanks, Mrs. Rowden. That's a picture of Bobby's horse, Black Beauty. I know that. We're going to play the donkey game. Well, all right. But then off to bed you go. # Now, once there was a donkey # # Who wouldn't leave his stall # # Because he wasn't happy # He had no tail at all # He said to me so sadly # As tears fell from his eyes # I need a tail so badly # To chase away the flies # Make the donkey smile with glee # Now, remember, you gotta keep your eyes closed. # Pin the tail where it should be # # With the safety pin # He flapped his ears in sorrow # # His food, he would not touch # # He even tried to borrow # The tail that meant so much # # The rooster lent a feather # Then laughed till he turned blue # # He said a feathered donkey # # Belongs inside a zoo You got to keep your eyes closed. # Make the donkey grin # Fasten the tail where it should be # # With the safety pin # So, come, let's give the donkey # # A brand new tail right now # # But don't let it surprise you # # If he should holler, "Ow!" # Make the donkey smile with glee # # Make the donkey grin # Fasten the tail where it should be # # With a safety pin Come on, Beauty. Stop that chasing around. Hey, look what I brought you. Gee, that's great. Look, Mike! High time he learned to hold a bit between his teeth. I'd best put it on him, Bobby. Well, why can't I? Well, it's quite a job putting a bit in a colt's mouth. He's not a colt anymore. What do you think, Mr. Adams? Well, it's Bobby's horse. I guess it's his job. Thanks, Dad. Good luck, son. Come on, boy. Be a good boy, will you? Don't be a baby. Come on, now, be a good guy, will you? Whoa, boy. You can do better than that. There's Bobby. You be careful now. You stay out of that corral. I will. Come on, Beauty. Come back here. Come on. Is that nice? Now, don't run around like that again. Easy, boy. Take it easy, now. Don't be a baby. Come on back here. Come on. Whoa. Easy there. Beauty. Whoa, boy. Go on, Bobby. He did it! You did it! Get out of here, will you? You scared him. I did not. Oh, yes, you did. I did not! Now, beat it. You all right, Bobby? Sure. Well, you got the bit in his mouth. That's the main thing. Well, it's more important to be sure we haven't got a horse on our hands we can't control. Well, he's just a little nervous. First time he's had a bit in his mouth. Besides, Lily scared him. I don't wanna see you get hurt. Gee, Dad, Beauty wouldn't hurt me. Oh, you can't be too sure about that. I want you to be more careful in handling him. I will, Dad. I promise. Please be careful. Oh, it doesn't hurt him, Bobby. He's just a bit scared. Easy, boy. Easy, boy. Easy, now. He'll stand still for me. Everything's all right, boy. Everything's all right. All right, Bobby. All right, now, Lily, I'll get you mounted, and then you can all be on your way. Up you go, young lady. Gee, it's great to be up here. Come on, Mike. Now, I've got to saddle up here. You two ride on ahead, and I'll catch up with you. Off you go, now. Go on. Gee, I wish I had a horse like yours. You're a girl. And besides, you're too young to ride a horse like this. I'm not. I can ride as good as you can. - That's what you think. - That's what I know. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I'll show you. I'll race you to the stream. All right. But you don't have a chance. He won't let any other horse go ahead of him. We'll see about that. Ready, go! Bobby, Bobby! Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Mainly, just keep him in bed and keep him quiet. Right, then. Your son's a very fortunate young man. - That fall could've been fatal. - Is he all right, Doctor? Oh, yes. I examined him thoroughly. No broken bones, no fractures. Just a few slight bruises. I'll stop by in the morning. Oh, thank you, Doctor. I wish you would. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Good-bye, Doctor. Well, now what have you to say? Well, I'm just thankful that both the boy and the horse are all right. Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get rid of that animal before this day is over. If you do, you'll break Bobby's heart. And yours, I suppose. Yes, and mine. There's nothing wrong with that horse, Mr. Adams, regardless of what the little Rowden girl told you. Well, we'll settle this right now. Tell Ben Farraday that I wanna see him. Ben left early this morning for the Pomona Fair. He wanted me to go along with him. He won't be back till tomorrow. I must take every possible precaution to protect that boy. If anything happened to him, I'd never forgive myself. I understand, Mr. Adams. How's Black Beauty? The doctor said you were to stay in bed. Is he all right? Mike says he's just fine. Now, you go on back to bed. I'm glad you came, son. He seemed to sense there was something wrong. I was worried about you, too, Beauty. Bobby, I think it's best you know now. Your father's gonna turn him over to Ben Farraday. Oh, no! First, he was going to get rid of him altogether. It was all my fault. Oh. Now, now, now. Good morning, Mr. Adams. Morning, Ben. How were your sales at the fair? Oh, I didn't take any stock down there to sell, I went to buy. - Well, come on in, sit down. - Thank you. How would you like to buy a good animal? Well, it depends on which one and how much. Well, Black Beauty is for sale for one dollar. You mean you wanna get rid of him? Well, on one condition. What's that? If he doesn't respond to training. I see. Farraday will probably arrange to have Glenroy train him. Anywhere they send you, I'll go, too. Anywhere in the whole world. Who knows, Bobby, maybe a little training will do him good. He's young enough and smart enough just the way he is. Your father won't have it any other way. Well, I think if you want to be fair, you'll let Bobby keep his horse. You've been talking to Mike. Yes, I have, and I agree with him. Any horse that'll stand by after his rider has been thrown as Bobby was doesn't need special training. Well, you'd change your mind if you'd heard what Lily had to say. You know, she told you an entirely different story than the one she told me. Well, then, you're no longer uneasy about the animal? Not at all. I wish he were mine. It's not fair! No matter what anybody says or does, we'll always be together, always. Sure you will, Bobby, he's gonna stay right here. Thanks. Well... I'd like to thank you, too, Mr. Adams. Where's the boy? He's still out there, wrapped up in a nice warm blanket. Well, it's high time he was in bed. Well, he's beginning to doze a bit. As soon as he falls asleep, I'll carry him to his room. Now, he's been getting out of hand lately. I think we're spoiling him, Mike. That may be, but a sensitive boy like Bobby needs gentle care. Now, I better be getting back to him. Good night, sir. Come in. Where's Bobby? Oh, he's with Mike. He wouldn't even eat his dinner. He's getting to be impossible. Maybe he feels the same way about you. Well, now, just a minute. Oh, Sam, come to your senses. There's nothing wrong with the boy. I suppose it's my fault he's so emotional, you can't reason with him the way you would a normal child. Well, I tried all along to be sympathetic to your problem. I can see it's just no use. Well, you may be right. When a horse becomes more important to a boy than his father, then, perhaps, he is hopeless. Sam, I've had somewhat the same problem with Lily. But with her, it was dolls instead of horses. You know, raising a girl without a father is almost as difficult as raising a boy without a mother. Well, then, what do you suggest? Allow him to lead a normal, natural life. You want him to be all boy one minute and obedient to the point it hurts the next. You have to know when and how to discipline a child. Well, I've been as patient and as generous with that boy as anyone could be. That's where you've made your biggest mistakes. Well, I don't understand you, Ann. You will if you'll listen. Okay, okay. And you're not going to like what I have to say. I can take it. You've got to stop trying to buy his love with gifts and stop treating him like a baby. And stop finding fault with everything he loves. A boy his age wants to feel that he and his dad are pals, that they both love and enjoy the same things. But you won't let him, that's why he's revolted against you. Thanks, Ann. I'm beginning to understand. But how could I have been so wrong? Thanks again. Good night, Sam. Good night. Hey, wait till you see all the things that dad ordered for him, and everything's brand new. Oh, this Black Beauty, I tell you, he's the lucky one. I'm the lucky one, he's my horse. Look at him, Bobby. I swear you'd think he could read his own name. He can't read upside down. You don't say. Oh, I almost forgot. Mrs. Rowden promised to take me over to pick up his new saddle and bridle. Hey, hey, what about this? We'll put it on later. Oh. Sam, this place is perfect. I love it. Oh, it's been great out here for me. You know, I was raised on a farm on the south of France, and every so often, I find myself wishing I was back there. I'm surprised to hear you say that. I'll have a place like this one day, you'll see. And you'd give up your career? Oh, no. That will always come first. Oh, by the way, there are some points in that personal appearance contract of yours that need clearing up. Hey, I hope you didn't bring me out here just to discuss business. You invited me to ride over to the Carters and have lunch, remember? Okay. Mike must have the horses saddled by now. Mike, this is Ms. Corday. How do you do, ma'am? Well, take your pick. I'll take the one on the left. That's Lady Elise, she's very gentle. I think I would prefer to ride a more spirited horse. How about that black one? Oh, no, that's my son's horse. I'd love to ride him. I'm afraid Bobby won't approve. Where is he, Mike? Hey, why all the fuss? Mike, where is he? He went over to the Rowdens, sir. - Oh, well, I'll be right back. - Well, let Mike tell him. Well, it won't take a minute. I'll get him on the phone. Mike, you can get started saddling that black one. I think we better wait, ma'am. It will be perfectly all right. You go ahead. You know, you're gonna get me into trouble. I wasn't able to reach him. Oh, he won't mind if I ride him. Mike, Mike! Come on, Mike! Mike! Come on and see what we've got! A brand new saddle and a bridle fit for a king. I hope Beauty doesn't get too excited when he sees it. He's gone! Where is he? What happened to him? Well, your father and a friend of his, or rather, a client, Ms. Corday, they rode over to Carter's. But how could he let anybody ride my horse? Now, don't worry, Bobby, they won't be gone for long. Besides, it wasn't your father's fault. Oh? No, there was absolutely nothing he could do, Mrs. Rowden. We'll see about that. Get in the car, Bobby. He really is high-spirited. - Well, now, don't get scared. - I'm not. I'm not a bit afraid. Nobody has ever ridden Beauty before except me. But you promised me I could ride him. But not until you're older. Well, we'll never catch up with them at this rate. I'll say we won't. I've never ridden such a nervous animal. Here, you better let me handle him. Are you all right? I think so. What happened? He's hurt, Bobby, I'm sorry. He's bleeding! If anything happens to you, I'll die. What do you think, Dr. Boyd? It's difficult to say, but we do have a mighty sick horse on our hands. He's gonna get well. Sure he is, Bobby, don't you worry. He's got a good strong heart and an iron will. All he needs is rest and good care. The animal's in great pain. I'm afraid the lung is punctured. If it were my horse, I'd shoot him. It's getting late, Bobby. There's nothing anyone can do. Don't say that. I mean, right now. He knows I'm here, standing by him. Mr. Adams wants to see you. You sent for me, Mr. Adams? Well, Ben Farraday agrees with Dr. Boyd. If the lung is punctured, we'll have to destroy him. Destroy him? When? Tonight. We can't let him suffer. I understand. It's just the shock of it. I know. Is Farraday out there? Yes. Oh, Mike? Tell Ben that I want him to take care of everything. Thank you, sir. I wouldn't push this off on you. I couldn't do it anyway. I'll be over at the Rowdens, and send Bobby over there. Yes, sir. You think he's getting any worse? His nostrils and eyes are still clear. Bobby, it's you your dad wants to talk to now. He's gone over to the Rowdens. I want to stay here. He's your father, Bobby, and if he wants to see you, you'll have to go. But I'm coming right back, and I'm gonna stay here all night, and all day tomorrow. I'll never leave until he's well. Ben, Mr. Adams asked if you'd destroy him. Neither one of us could bring ourselves to do it. What do you want to tell me? It's about Black Beauty. Bobby. It was an accident. It wasn't your father's fault. He never got hurt, Mrs. Rowden. As long as he was with me, because I knew how to ride him, and I know no matter what, he'd never let any other horse go ahead of him. There. Easy, boy. How's that? Mike. You better go over and join Bobby and Mr. Adams. Now, you don't want Black Beauty to suffer. No, not for anything. Bobby, neither do we. But he's gonna get well. He is, he is! I wanna go back to him! Your friend has gone away. No. No! Bobby, please, listen to your father. It was the only humane thing to do. You told him to! I'll get you another horse. I don't want any other horse! Please! Bobby! Bobby! - No! - Bobby, please. Listen to me. Bobby, please. Listen, son. Easy, Bobby, listen to your father. Bobby, listen. Right after you left, I noticed his breathing had eased up a bit, and his nostrils and mouth were still clear. So, I called Dr. Boyd, he brought in a specialist. You mean, there's still hope? I couldn't possibly say as yet. How soon will they know? Pretty soon, I believe. I'd better tell Mr. Adams. - Mr. Adams. - Shh, he's asleep. Oh, that's good. See, that Ben Farraday, he knows more about horses than any of us. What happened? He called Boyd again and had him bring a specialist over. How does it look? They'll know very shortly. Dr. Boyd and the specialist are leaving. The examination showed the lung isn't pierced. I don't know how to thank you, Ben. Neither do I. Get up. Up. Up, boy. Up, boy. Up, boy. That's it, there you go. He looks okay. Well, thank heaven for that. All right, come on, boy. I think Black Beauty would like to see you. He's all right again. He's gonna be his old self before you know it. You're gonna be just fine, boy. Nobody'll ever ride you again. Nobody, except me. Well, I've got to admit, it was the O'Banion blood that pulled him through. Well, you know what they say, animals get their strength from the father. And their courage from the mother. # Black Beauty # Beautiful to see # I can't believe that you belong to me # # Black Beauty # Every time we ride # You are the pride of all the countryside # # When we ride towards the rainbow, around the bend # # You are more to me than just a friend # # Black Beauty # When the starlight gleams # We're together riding through my dreams # # Black Beauty # When the starlight gleams # You make me happy # Happy as can be # Black Beauty # Galloping along # I feel like singing every happy song # # When we ride through the meadows in the sun # # You're the pride and joy of everyone # # Black Beauty # When the view is high # We'll ride to dreamland somewhere in the sky # # We'll ride to dreamland somewhere in the sky #
