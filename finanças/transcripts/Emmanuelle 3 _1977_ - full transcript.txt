Hi, Angélique. Séraphin, stop! Is Emmanuelle here? Up there. - How are you? - Fine. Mrs. Emmanuelle. - Yes. Is that Angélique? - Yes. Come here. Hi, how are you? - Fine, and you? - Good. I brought your dress. Perfect. Bravo, Angélique. It's perfect. It could be adjusted a bit more here. Wait. Ouch! You pricked me. You must suffer to be pretty. Did the nuns teach you that? It's nothing. It's much better like this. You were right. Can you help me take it off? It's nothing. You'll have it tomorrow. Thanks. You know, a dress should show enough, but not too much, So men want to see more. That's you. You've got a one-track mind. You don't? I do, but I'm not as successful. What are you talking about? Jean really likes you. Really? Is that true? Do you want to make love to him? Wouldn't you be jealous? No. I'm happy when he's happy. And, on top of that, I like you. Oh, you! That must be him. - I'm off. - No, stay. We'll surprise him. Hi, Séraphin. Make me a drink? - Who's with Madame? - Angélique, sir. - The seamstress? - Yes. Angélique. Bravo. Is that good? I hope my husband isn't home yet. Are you happy with him? He's very jealous. Does he make love well? Every day, but too fast. Not like Mr. Jean. He knows how. I didn't know it was so nice with three. Dear sir, you'll never guess what's happened. We hit a bird going past the botanical gardens. Mr. Céladon's parrot. Which Mr. Céladon? He had a broken foot. We took him to the vet. He wasn't there. He went to treat a dog at Sans Souci, so we went there. He put a cast on his foot. We waited for it to dry. Where is this parrot? We took it to Mr. Céladon's. Which Mr. Céladon? The printer, you know, with a wooden leg. That's why Angélique is so late. What a story! Florence made us a delicious fish tartar. It was raw tuna, marinated in lime juice, with a touch of nutmeg and pistachios. Cordier claims it's an aphrodisiac. Not surprising. I actually like Cordier. He's a sex maniac, but he has no ambitions in life, not even making money. That's rare. You moved in with them? You could say that. You'll start painting again? Nicolas, put on your hat! Guillaume, tell him to put on his hat. Obey your mother, please. Look who's with Gérard. This is Vanessa. She's a stewardess. She leaves tonight. Didn't know where to swim. First time in the Seychelles? The sea's hard to find. - What did she say? - Nothing. It's a joke. I'll show you where to change. I already have my suit on. I heard you at the disco last night. Friends came for dinner. We finished late. Florence was tired. We all went to bed. Obviously. - Your brother's puritanical. - The whole family. Be careful, Vanessa. The sun's dangerous, especially now. I'll put some coconut oil on you. What's new, Gérard? Not much, same old thing. They're making a film. A film? So I heard, like Robinson Crusoe. Back-to-nature things are all the rage in Europe. We should close all the travel agencies. It's paradise here. Seychelles, the jewel of the ocean Seychelles, a charming place What's with you? I'm sick of it. He throws himself at women. It's pure provocation. It's pathetic. Why would he do that? As long as he's having fun. I'm not like you. I can't accept it. You're being dramatic. It's not that bad. I'd have left him long ago if it weren't for the kids. Clara's not liberated. That's all. I feel sorry for her, I swear. She's at the end of her rope. I've no pity for her. She's too possessive, afraid of losing him. Maybe he didn't handle things very well. I'm sure she doesn't like love. When you see a couple like that, it shows we're right to live the way we do. - I have a surprise for you. - Who? The Swede from the yacht club you watch during regattas... wants to build a home. I spoke of the Tatamaka Rock and said you'd take him. Well? He passed by like a ghost ship. He saw me... stared at me. His stare made me come... as I made love to the Swede. It was a strange pleasure... almost painful. - Can you still see him? - Yes. Don't lose him. - That ship? - Yes. I rented it to a Frenchman all day yesterday. - Do you remember his name? - No. - Or where he lives? - In a hotel, I think. Did he say if he'd be back? He said nothing. He just asked for a tour of the island. You're fresh as morning dew. I'm as hungry as a wolf. Speaking of wolves. Is Chloé sleeping? - She's not with you? - No. She sleeps alone. Her neurosis. Florence showers after sex. I shower when I'm too hot. What's with the dogs? They're annoying. We'll get together more. I forgot how nice it is to make love together. I didn't. That's enough, dogs. Jimmy, Olga, lie down! That's nice. It's him. Who? The ghost ship. Who are you talking about? It can't be. He's a director looking for decor for his film. I didn't get your name. Grégory Perrin. Florence, Emmanuelle and Jean. Friends... - Hello. - Hello. I believe we've met, haven't we? Maybe, yes. Why are you laughing? Something Emmanuelle told me. Come on. I'll show you my house. It has a story, you know. It was built by a retired colonel of the Indian Army. It's entirely made of teak. You can't hammer in a nail. He stole the wood when the English left. He brought a boatful. Hi, everyone. Do you know Mr. Perrin? Oh, sorry. With pretty eyes like that, no need to be prudish. Especially with a director. Looking for a star? No, just decor. - What type? - Houses. Like what? In ruins, pretty old, and preferably isolated. There's one on La Digue. I can show you if you want. Is it far? No, it's in my room. I painted it last year. Are you coming? I don't think Chloé has a chance. He only looked at Emmanuelle. What do you think? He's not bad. I'll see what they're doing. - Tell us. - Obviously. She's tireless. How do you go to this island? A boat goes every morning. It takes a bit under three hours. I can take you on my husband's boat. No, thanks. I'll take the daily boat, so I see people. What people? I like what you do. It's happy, isn't it? - You're inspired here? - No more than elsewhere. It's like everywhere. You put your own happiness in the landscape. - Can we leave by the garden? - Yes. - You'll go to La Digue? - Tomorrow. Say good-bye to your friends. Hello. You didn't see me follow you in my boat? No. I guess you want to see the house now? That's why I came. Two modes of transportation: bikes or carts. Let's take a cart. - Have you lived here long? - Almost three years. We were in Bangkok and Hong Kong before. - Husband's a civil servant? - No, an architect. - Here we are. - It's here? No, there's no more road. We'll go along the beach. - This is the school? - Yes. Grégory- Know why I brought you? I want to make love. Really? - You don't? - I didn't say that. You're surprised because you don't know me. I've no prejudices. When I want someone, I say so. Makes things simpler. Love's my only interest. - That's all you do? - Practically. Monotonous, no? Not at all. You need imagination. It's you who made me come by the rock the other day. There was someone there. Who? Get undressed. You undress me. See, you want me. That's normal. You're very pretty. No, wait. Take your time. Don't move. Do you like having a complacent husband? He's not complacent. He likes seeing me happy. Even with other men? That surprises you. Ever asked what's behind that? Why do you think something's behind it? It just doesn't seem natural. I wouldn't want my love to have sex with another. - You'd prefer lies? - In that case, yes. You're such a prude. Loving someone who loves you is rare. Risking ruining that in the name of sincerity... I don't see the point. I have to leave. Why? Jean doesn't know I'm here. Thought you told him everything. I'll tell him tonight. You'll have fun due to me. That shocks you? It would if I loved you. I'm sure you think I'm a whore. I love whores. The price is 200 rupees here. Here's 300. It was great. You asshole! Hi. - How are you, Guillaume? - Fine. Clara left, you know. Left? Where'd she go? To her aunt's, with the kids. What happened? I invited a nurse over last night. She seemed to want to after dinner. Clara seemed okay with it, at first. But when she saw us have sex, tears, yelling. You can't force her to do it if she doesn't want to. Obviously. I have to go. I'm on duty. Bye, Jean. What are you going to do? I don't know. Want me to talk to her? She says you gave me these ideas. Thanks. - Poor Clara. - Poor idiot. What can we do to help them? Let them deal on their own. - What did you do today? - I went to La Digue. I met the director we saw. You've a one-track mind. He's less interesting than I thought. Did you make love? Yes, badly. I'm not surprised. I didn't waste my time. I met a tourist who's already dying to meet you. Cécile, like in Dangerous Liaisons. It could be fun, no? Hi, kids. How are you? Auntie! It's Emmanuelle! - Is your mom here? - Yes. Come see the turtles. That's the oldest one. Auntie says it's over 100. That's the mom. She laid a big egg and buried it. How are you? - Did Guillaume send you? - No. He told you? About the nurse? - I'm such a prude, huh? - That's not the problem. - Mom! - In a minute, honey. I tried in the beginning, to make him happy. But it's over. I can't do it. I understood it all one night, with Chloé. He wants me to be there, not because he wants me... but to have a clear conscience. Did you tell him that? I didn't need to. My body spoke for me. From one day to the next, I was frigid. It used to be good, though. Angélique. Hi. What happened? My husband. He caught me talking to the neighbor. - Talking? - Yes. I was sitting on his lap. How dirty. Yeah. You're lucky your husband's not jealous. I'm not either. - Coming, Angélique? - Yes. Bye, Emmanuelle. Bye. To your loves, Cécile. To love. What's that dance? It's the Sega. There's a dance that ends in an orgy. That's the Moutia. It's more primitive. It's more than a dance. It's a happening. When people drink a lot, it degenerates. Emmanuelle can tell you more than I. - Tell me. - No. I don't remember. I was in an altered state. I must have been taken by two or three men. Four. You don't even remember if it was pleasurable? You said you were almost unconscious that night. No, her pleasure lasted a long time. I took her home exhausted. - You can't understand. - I'm not a virgin, you know. Good for you. - Want to dance? - No. Tell me more about your parties. Okay. I'm exhausted. You were really amazing. My heart's racing. Yes, it's true. You feel it? I'll pay, and we'll go. Jean talked about you. You're really a free couple. It's great. I'd love to be like you. Why? What would you do with your freedom? I'd like to come over. That was slick. She's an idiot. You could've stayed. You know I don't have fun without you. I don't know what's with you lately. - Jean? - What? You know the girl who was with the director? I'd like her. It might not be easy. Why not? They seem to be in love. Haven't you noticed? What happened on the island the other day? He threw me out, treated me like a whore. What an ass. See what I see? Which one do you think gave in? Guillaume. She must have blackmailed him with the kids. You're the most misogynic ladies' man I know. Hi, how are you? - And you? - Fine. - Happy? - What's new? We're going to Kenya. Want to come? Coralie will baby-sit. Sure. Why not? It's pretty calm here now. I hate safaris. We don't have to hunt. I don't want to go. If you change your mind, we can always get tickets from Gerard, okay? - Even last minute. - Okay. I don't get it. You're usually the one who loves traveling. What's keeping you here? Can't you see they need to be alone? Guillaume seemed to insist we come. He's like all men, terrified of being alone with her and having to explain himself. You know if you inadvertently walk into a room with a naked woman, it's polite to say “Excuse me, ma'am," but tactful to say “Excuse me, sir.” A bellboy walks into a room with a dry martini, and his client's making love to a woman. He remembers his tact, he mutters, “Excuse me, which man ordered the dry martini?" - May I have a smoke? - They're all gone. There are some upstairs. Be right back. Do you like my husband? I saw this coming. Well? With you, anything you like. I like you. But it's out of the question with him. I only like women. - Exclusively? - Exclusively. And Grégory? Grégory knows what he's dealing with. - How'd you meet? - I acted in his first film. Then we lost touch. I was glad to see him again. He looks relaxed. I think his problems got worked out. - What problems? - With his wife. He's married? He was, but it ended badly. Decided to be open, like a modern couple, a free couple. The first time he said he had a mistress, she jumped out the window. - She died? - No, luckily she survived, but spent six months in a hospital. He stayed with her. He was afraid she'd try again, until the day she left him for the surgeon who treated her. What was she like? Very pretty and a bit distant, kind of like you. I'm distant? I mean you're the kind of woman a man can idealize. Yet you exist. We can touch you. Caress me, even. I really like you, you know? Poor Jean. You're so unlucky. Dorothée only likes women. If that's all it is... can I watch you? No, I can't stand having a man watch me. Sorry. Don't make that face. Good night. He's gone. Yes, he's gone. Tell me about Grégory. How are you? - Why are you here? - I live here now. The Cordiers fell for a girl named Cécile and made it known I was in the way, as usual. Our door is open. You're sweet. I found a bird-watcher. A bird-watcher? Yes, an Englishman who spent two months on Bird Island and studies sea birds' sexuality. Did you know they invented orgies? What? Yes, it excites them to see others having sex near them. Cordier must've been a bird in another life. Seen Grégory? I think I saw him go down to the beach. Still chasing him? Yes, but he's hard to catch. - Bye. - Bye. - Am I bothering you? - Not at all. I was working. I come to make peace. That's funny. I dreamt of you last night. Really? We were on a boat. You said we had to do it fast. Then a man swam up, the black man you danced with the other night. He threatened me with a harpoon. I wanted to dive to escape him, but the water was teeming with sharks. You were laughing. You still mistrust me. You or another. Dreams aren't always what they seem. Finding locations? Yes. I need to go to Praslin Island. I'll go tomorrow. I'll take you. Silhouette Island. Chloé lived there in the beginning. - Chloé's the painter? - Yeah. She lives in the hotel now. She came here... two years ago with an American poet. She was pregnant, but it went badly. She lost her baby. The doctor said she couldn't have more. So the American left her, and she was alone and penniless. She stayed with one person, then another, and sold her paintings. She never got over it. Do you want kids? Jean doesn't. And you? I think of it at times. There are fish over there. Want to fish? I've never fished. I was jealous of Dorothée. She told me. A first for me. Never too late. - You don't believe me. - I do. - But I like it. - Is that true? We'll stop at Round Island. There's a restaurant there. They'll grill our fish for us. There's one. It's yours. See? It's not hard. - You thought I was horrible. - Yes. I don't want to do that again. Don't want to have sex? Yes, I do. But I want to start over, as if we'd just met. I want you to talk to me, to court me. Don't make fun of me. What's your film about? A guy who's tired of the crazy lives we lead and goes to live on a deserted island. - Alone? - At first. Then a clueless girl shows up. He tries to throw her out. She stays. And he falls in love with her. And then? They live happily like that for a while. Then he sees she's bored. So he goes back to Europe, back to his old life, and she meets another man and leaves him. Not a happy story- Nope. What was your wife like? I don't talk about her. Are you still in love with her? I already told you I can only love one person at a time. I'm sorry. That Praslin Island? Yes, we're here. The hotel's on the far side on a beach. You'll see. It's the end of the earth. There they are. We missed you, honey. Hello. Come on. Did it go well? Very well, thanks. Aren't our islands made for love? That's the truth. The rooms are ready. Grégory, you're in the room at the end. Albert, take him. You can shower in my room. Jean wanted an ocean view. It only has a sink. Not happy to see us? I hate cops. My idea. I wanted Cécile to see sea coconuts. Pretend I'm not here. - Grégory, are you here? - Yes. Let's go. Why? It's charming here. Don't be a fool. And I like seeing your husband and your friends. At first Emmanuelle confused eroticism and vice. She wasn't wrong. There's no eroticism without the idea of sin. Here we go. In India, China, and Japan, sins of the flesh don't exist. Yet they can teach us. We're too Christian to have sensual pleasure without thinking we're bad. Don Juan's true pleasure was provoking God. The other night when we watched you make love to Edwin, don't you feel guilty? When I watched, what troubled me wasn't Chloé's caresses, but the memory of the intense pleasure I felt the first time I saw my parents making love. How old were you? Being brave is ageless. That's psychobabble. Maybe a bit, dear Jean, but if we look we'll find something similar in your need to see Emmanuelle in these positions. What do you think? I had no religious education. She's dancing badly. Show her. I have no desire to put on a show. Because of him? Didn't bother you before. I do as I like. You do as he likes. So what? It's sad to see you obeying this redresser of wrongs. Are you shocked, Boy Scout? Leave him alone. What's wrong with you? You're crazy! Stop! Are you okay? I'm okay! Emmanuelle! Jean, don't be an idiot. What is this? Come on. We'll spend the night with Cécile. Come see. - What? - Come see. How will we get back? I'll call Gérard. He'll come get us. Philoé says you need a house to film in? That's right. - Find one? - Not really. In that case, I'd be happy to show you mine if you want. With pleasure. I congratulate you, sir. You have a beautiful wife. It's a bachelor's house. When my wife was alive, it was much neater. The cinnamon smells good. My great-grandfather already sold spices. He was one of the first Englishmen here, in your Napoleon's era. If you want to relax, watch the pirate ships pass by the islands. They rested on the beaches with their pretty black slaves. The world has changed. Women were submissive in those days. Now they're in charge. Have you been married for a long time? Two days. Look how pretty she was. What happened to her? Something horrible, ma'am. Luckily it's rare here. A shark... Some fishermen had caught a giant turtle and were dismembering it in the water, on the bank. It made a big blood stain that spread out in the water. The blood drew the shark. I saw it devour her before my eyes. I couldn't do anything. I thought I'd die but then, life always wins. Speaking, ma'am. That's right. Call me here... at what time? So you met old man Snow. Yes, he's great. - He's totally crazy. - Yes, with what happened. His wife's death by a shark? He told you that? It's horrible. Susan's not dead. She slept around and ran off with a marine officer. Snow'd rather imagine her dead than in someone else's bed. Look, do you remember the little fish market and the ox carts? Too bad we can't land here. I'd like to see the house again. We can come back tomorrow by boat and stay a few days. Where to, sir? The yacht club, please. Why? To get the car and go home. No, you'll come to the hotel with me. I owe Jean an explanation after what happened. Pillow talk? As usual? I want this clear. Don't you? It's very clear. Tomorrow we're leaving for a week. He has no say. No, but I never hide anything from him. As you like. I'll come to your hotel tonight. Phone first, I may be busy. Idiot. - How are you? - Good. Who's that? Come say hi to Mrs. Emmanuelle. Hi. Is that the neighbor? My sister-in-law's brother. - And your husband? - Fishing. Oh. Good night then. Yes, thanks. Mr. Perrin, you have a telegram. A telegram? Thank you. Get me the telegraph office. Okay, you can count on me. Good night, sir. - Who was it? - Mr. Perrin. What did he want? He must go to Paris. He wanted to tell Madame. He wants her to call. Okay, I'll tell her. He said it was very important. Do you want a whiskey? That's okay. I'll get it. You can go. It's late. - How's your daughter? - Better, thanks. - Good night, Mr. Jean. - Good night. Already home? Have you seen Jean? No, not yet. I came for news. You're playing games. I'm not playing. I'm doing as I want, as usual. Don't ruin things. I'm tired of this life. Normal, we tire of everything. I've been there. I almost left Michel once. - Why didn't you? - Because. That love doesn't last. You'll age. You'll get ugly. You won't be desirable. I think of it often. I know the only person I can always hang on to is Michel. He'll die having sex, and probably not in my arms. But I would have been his only true accomplice against death. That's what counts, isn't it? There's no answer, sir. - Impossible, try again. - I'll call back. Hello. Hello. Are you going out? Yes, with you. I reserved a table at La Siréne. Good, I wanted to talk to you. - You're changing? - Yes, just a sec. I acted like an idiot last night. That's true. It wasn't like you. No. It's still busy, sir. Fine, forget about it. - I'll try again. - Forget it. Hi. Where's Emmanuelle live? At the Royal Cove. Why? I must see her. - What's wrong? - Nothing, come on. Hi, Mr. Jean. Your table's ready. I want to take her to Paris. Really? She can't live with these zombies forever. Can you give her a better life? Not this farce, anyway. They're grotesque, rambling on eroticism, their “complicity" with the free couple. To each his own. No one's here. How can that be? Where are they? How would I know? At a restaurant? With friends? - At the Cordiers'? - No, they're busy tonight. We'll look everywhere. We just have time to go to the hotel for the bags. Or you catch the plane in two days. In two days... I can't. I must be in Paris tomorrow morning. Oh, shit! You'll come back. I can't. The filming is canceled. Got a pen? Yes, in the car. I used to be happy you were happy, even with others. But he... drives me crazy. You're jealous? Yes. The sentiment disgusts me. Why? It's a proof of love. I thought we were past that sort of love. I guess not. It's like fire. Understand? So far we've been able to avoid getting burned. It's useless to live as we have to get here. I'd be capable of the worst to keep you. Don't say that. The worst. I left the key in the car. Can you... I don't see it. I have it. Sorry. I have to pack. Already? Yes, we're meeting at the hotel. We're leaving early. - Northholme Hotel? - Yes, ma'am. Mr. Perrin, please. Mr. Perrin's not here. When will he be back? He's on the plane for Paris. - What? - Good-bye. What's wrong? They said he left for Paris tonight. It can't be. Call the hotel, confirm it. It must be a mistake. I'm going. Might be true. I'll go with you. I'll sleep in the living room. I've a meeting at the site tomorrow. I have to leave early. I won't wake you. Thank you. Try to sleep. Wake up. Oh, it's you. What's wrong? Are you sick? I took a sleeping pill. Grégory left, you know. I know. Where were you last night? Last night? Séraphin, can you come in? Coming, ma'am. It can't be. Jean couldn't have done that. It's the only explanation. I can't believe it. Come in, Séraphin. Hi, ma'am. Hi. Mr. Perrin called last night? Yes, ma'am. Why didn't you tell me? I asked Mr. Jean to tell you. Did you find a letter under the door? No, ma'am. There was no mail. Thanks, Séraphin. You see. Do you have Grégory's address? Jean. You're here? You're too late. Emmanuelle already left. She asked me to explain stuff to you. There's nothing to explain. I gave it my all... and I lost. - Catch her. - No. She has to see this through to the end. She'll grow bored of him and come back. I don't think so. Who knows? What will you do all alone in this big house? With a little imagination... Excuse me, sir. What should I do about dinner? Set two places as usual, Séraphin. Marie, do you have the tickets? I thought Jean loaned you out to keep you. He let you sleep around but he controlled it. Maybe. He's like the rest, only smarter. No, that's not true. We were very happy. We really tried to live differently. I don't think that's the way. I don't either, but it's no reason to go backwards. And Grégory? What's he think? I don't know. I hardly know him. He may be a tyrant in his own way. I'll see. I won't return. Things must change. We're suffocating here. Paris isn't easier. Okay, everything's set. You change in Nairobi, a 5-hour layover, get to Rome at 12, and Paris the next day. Why didn't you wait 'til tomorrow for a direct flight? I don't want to see Jean again. And the trip to Kenya? Guillaume's on call. It's been canceled. Everything's okay now? Yeah. You have to go now. - Write to me. - Of course. Bye, kids.
