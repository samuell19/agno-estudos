There's always a price to pay when you hire an assassin - from ten to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Recently, a mysterious killer has appeared in Hong Kong. He asks for no payment for his services. He eliminates his targets - all evil men - because they deserve to die. In the World of professional killers, this vigilante is considered to be the king of killers. Others who live in fear know him as the "Angel of Death" Check Zone A. You check Zone B. Make sure everything's in order. Follow me. - Good evening, sir. - All leveIs have been secured, sir. - Is the boss still in there? - Yes, sir. Stay alert. Of all women, I find the Chinese are the most exciting in bed. How could they be better than Japanese women? Because their strong sense of moral values makes them highly reserved. I remember sleeping with them during the war. I'd hear their screams of pain, begging me to stop, but it just made me more excited. Japanese women can do that too. No, it's not the same at all. How i long for those days. Find out what's happening! Sasaki? - What's going on? - We're checking, don't worry, sir. - Check for intruders. - Sir! Some sake? Something's wrong with the monitor. Check it out. Sir, he's out cold. Someone must've broken in. Check the surrounding monitors. Shut all elevator power immediately! Do you read me? Control, do you read me? Sasaki? Shut up! So, who hired you to kill me? I?ll make you an offer. I?ll pay you three times what he did. You have no idea who you're dealing with. If you kill me, you'll also end up dead. You'll be hunted down by professional hitmen from all over the World. Yes, and whoever kills you will receive a huge reward. They'll all be after your head. So if l were you, I?d just go. Leave while you still can. You stupid idiot! You've just signed your own death warrant! Excuse me. - Ma'am, i... - One minute. But you gave me the wrong change. It says there that these are on sale for haIf this price. Let me see. Hey, Jerry, you forgot to remove the old tags again. Can l have my money back? l already punched it in. Do me a favour, go and get something else! But I?ve got everything l need. Can't you see the queue? You're delaying the other customers! Then give me my change. - There! - Thanks. Hey, you cheat, move on. Hello there. ..I walked behind him, and called out. He turned around and i shot him! Right in the forehead! His head exploded like a watermelon! I left him there, his brains splattered everywhere! Shooting through the heart is much cleaner and quicker. Joey, don't you have another assignment for us yet? We could do with the cash. There's one coming up, and you're all in. - Fred, have you called your mom yet? - No. She's your only family, right? In that case, why don't you come? You could get lots of money to send her. Why don't you buy a new pair of pants? These are very comfortable. All right, you two, you'll be coming with me to Macao. Joey, can i use this a while? You've got some nerve freeloading off me like this! - Joey, I haven't called my mother... - I don't give a damn! I gave you that assignment to kill Mrs Chu... and you repair her drainpipes! She needed my help - besides she reminded me of my mom. What about that knife i gave you you used to cut your target's steak? But he couldn't even chew properly. And you call yourseIf a soldier of the Golden Triangle. Some tough guy! Maybe you should leave and stop wasting my time. All i really need is one big hit. - Not for just a few thousand... - Like a hundred million? - Are you kidding? - Do i look like I?m kidding? - A hundred million US dollars! - Let me do it, boss. Come on! Get serious! These guys want first-class killers. - I could be a first-class killer. - Really. You look more like first-class jerks to me. Hell, forget about Macao. - Hey, come on, boss. - Wait up, wait up. Joey, could you tell me where i can sign up for that? Please, help me. You really want that job? OK, go to the Tsukamoto Centre tomorrow morning. Someone might just notice your rags and toss you a few cents. Eiji, the fund manager's here. You'd better come and meet him. Eiji, what is your problem? I was wondering how a great man such as my grandfather could end up with such a worthless son, the likes of you. You've no right to talk to me like that. It was your father who was killed and you're not doing anything to avenge his death. He's taken care of that. Only because you don't have the guts to do it. Useless people like you will be the downfall of Japan. You're not even capable of running your own father's business. Well, I?m in charge now. I?ve inherited everything. You don't even have a sense of honour. That's what grandfather and i had in common. Eiji, your grandfather's ashes are in there! No! No! These are my grandfather's ashes. Eat them and he shall live inside you. Go on! You're mad! You're nothing but an old coward. You don't deserve his ashes inside you. No! Stop! You really are mad! The board will hear about this. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Sorry, Father. I?m afraid they won't listen to you any longer. I have Grandfather's soul, so they have no choice but to follow me now. You're all mad! Phew, he stinks! ''A Day in the Life of a Professsional Killer.'' Grandpa, that man is really smelly. Quiet, now. The woman who just came in is Anita May. She's 33 years old and runs a prestigious modelling agency. No criminal record, but according to Interpol, she's involved in some of the biggest crimes in Europe. She recruits top European hitmen to assassinate political figures. She probably gets her clients from her modelling agency. - This is coffee? - Well, it's decaff, sir. What's the point in drinking coffee if it's decaff? Forget it. This is Chris Crado, 42 years old, runs a liquor business, no criminal record, sir. Aside from selling vodka, he acts as an agent for Russian gangs operating all over Asia. Therefore he could easily get in touch with Russian assassins. So why have all these agents appeared at the Tsukamoto Centre? Aren't they afraid of being caught together? It's because they all want the one hundred million dollar reward. If you were a hitman, you'd be here too. - Something's up, Captain. - Zoom in, please. Look, if you don't have an invitation, you'd better leave. Just give me a chance. I?m the man for the job. What the hell are you talking about? - Please... - Get out of here... I really need the money and... - Are you looking for trouble? - Please, let me go, sir. Are you deaf? I said leave. Stop! Hold it right there! Do you morons have any idea who this man is? He may stink and look like hell, but he's also the top hitman in Mainland China! - So you're an assassin? - l served at the Golden Triangle. Great! Just play it by ear. What? Do you know me? Do you have any idea who I am? Well? You want to see my invitation? Well, all you have to do is ask. Now, you listen. I want to speak to your superior right away. - I am the superior. - Then you understand the problem. Jerk, here! I?ll take you in, but you do exactly what l say. Can you repeat that in Chinese? And in Japanese, if you like. Have you prepared the bank draft, sir? Five million dollars in a Swiss bank. Thank you. - Five million? - That's just for deposit. Attention, please. My name is Martin, I?m Mr Tsukamoto's fund manager. If you need a translator, use the earpiece in front of you and tune in to the desired language channel. You're all aware of Mr Tsukamoto's recent assassination. His will states that a reward will be offered to avenge his death. Please turn on the computers in front of you. Each of you has an account at a Swiss bank with a balance of $5m. Please enter your four-digit private code - your ID for your account. Whoever completes the mission will automatically receive the reward into his or her account. And for everyone's convenience, I?ve filed all the details regarding the death in your computers. You've all received the same information to ensure a fair deal. I?ll repeat the terms again. The killer and the mastermind are worth 50 million dollars each. If they are the same person, then he is worth 100 million dollars. If there's official evidence that either one doesn't exist or is already dead, the full reward is for the remaining target. Ah, the right target. The right target will be identified by us. We form a special committee set up by Mr Tsukamoto. Regarding our professional details, all information can be accessed on your computer. Lastly, I want to make this clear - we do not encourage lawbreakers. We won't be held responsible should you become involved in any illegal activities - you'll also be disqualified. - Police! - This is a search warrant. Everyone please remain in your seats and take out your identification. You're all suspected of being involved in international crimes. Please cooperate, if you don't want any trouble. I?d be more careful, if i were you. We have two lawyers here, Officer. What's happening here? We're in the middle of a legitimate business deal. I?ll have my secretary send you a report. Great! Why do you have so many discount coupons? - I collect them. - And why so many coins? He collects them also, so? - And this knife? - What about it? It's for cooking. - Can't he speak? - I?m his manager. Everyone with talent needs a manager. So what's your talent? He's a great gymnast. He's also good at running, although he needs more training. His record's 9.9 seconds for 100 metres. Let's go, men. Aren't we going to arrest them? If they want to play with fire... - Isn't that Tsukamoto's grandson? - Yes, he's joining the hunt. Are family allowed take part? Mr Tsukamoto, sir. I don't like being interrupted before my meal. What do you want? Actually, I also have an appointment - a bridge game. And i promised my friends l wouldn't be late. You Chinese talk a lot. If i were you, I?d get to the point. Your mere presence is starting to irritate my men. All right. I?ve gathered some new information. If it's about my grandfather's death, I already know everything. Of course, but something new has come up. Since your grandfather didn't want the police involved, we had to use all our influence to avold an autopsy. But we had someone examine him. And he discovered something very interesting. - What do you want? - You know what i want. I?ll give you the information, but i want something in return. I scratch your back, you scratch mine, right? And the others? You'll be first to get any news, so long as you pay $100m each time. Aren't you the least bit scared of me? I am, but I?m more afraid of living miserably. Right? You can cash this cheque any time of day. I just hope your information is worth it. What we found in your grandfather's body was a military banknote, dating from the Second World War. We still haven't decoded it, but our computers will fix that in no time. - When? - After I?ve cashed this cheque. Your meal is ready, Master Eiji. Remove the extra setting, he's not eating, he might ruin my appetite. No problem, I don't eat sashimi anyway. In fact, I hate it. On that night, most of the security cameras were destroyed by Tsukomoto's murderer. But we do have some videos, recorded days before the murder occurred. They also gave us a video recorded the night of the murder. But although the killer is visible, he can't be identified as his back is to the camera. Bill, you've seen the tape, what do you think? I think he's been in the centre before. He knew his way around and where all the cameras were located. So there's no doubt he'd given the place a thorough going over. Maybe he got hold of the blueprints. But most of the cameras were installed under a month ago, sir. The blueprints wouldn't tell him where they were. How do we trace the killer, then? Well, we could run his image through the computer, together with anyone who has been there. All right, get video tapes dating back a month and start with that. Yes, sir. And Bill, don't let anyone into the computer room. They used to be bigger. What a rip off! What are you looking at? You pervert! Get lost! Take it easy. He was staring right down my cleavage! So, you like my watch? It's a Rolex, 24 karat gold-plated and diamond studded. It's to commemorate the reunification of Hong Kong with Mainland China. - Have it! - I?ve never had a watch before. Now, I have a Rolex. Don't get too excited, it's a fake. You don't expect the real thing, do you? Even so, in Tsim Sha Tsui, this would cost about $800! This is the most expensive gift I?ve ever received! - You're a Chinaman, all right. - What? It's just that Mainland hitmen charge between 40 and 50 thousand. You get 80 thousand with 10 thousand down payment. But the reward was 100 million! I?m your agent, right? I have to pay for everything, meals, transportation and i have to pay my informers. Don't you think your share is just a little excessive? I invested 5 million dollars without even knowing you. No-one would do that! Or would you rather forget it? How about we split 60-40? - Not a chance! - What about 70-30? All right, 80-20 and I?ll take the down payment. First of all, I just want to make sure you can fight. And you must do everything I tell you. Then tell me what you want. - You know what... - Hey, you! Enough of your noise! You've got 30 seconds. I?ll give you something to shout about! Get lost! You son-of-a-bitch! 15 seconds, Norman. Sorry, I didn't mean to... Sorry, lady, excuse me. You wouldn't dare hit a woman! Come on! Run away then! - What? - But she's a lady. You don't hit ladies? I?d better look for someone else. Wait, Norman! What you need is a whole new wardrobe, if you want to be taken seriously as a professional. There's nothing more impressive than a stylish killer. - What's the matter? - This costs $19,000! Well, if you dress expensive, you look expensive. That's how it works. I was wondering if you could help us. You see, my friend here, ah... he wants to try a new style. The ideal material is polyester. It's soft and tightly knit, so you won't leave fibres on the crime scene. Long coats are good for carrying weapons. Black suits look smarter and slicker. And as for the hair... always use mousse to avold leaving hair or dandruff on the scene. - What are they for? - To make you look smarter. I?ll be in touch. Take this pager. Where's my down payment? What about all these new clothes! Listen, don't follow me, all right? You will call? These clothes cost me $19,000, of course I?ll call. His name is Norman Lu, alias Crocodile Lu. His file's about an inch thick - theft, selling of porno tapes, swindling and illegal gambling. I?m sure he's up to another scam, acting as an agent. He did invest $5m just like the others. Maybe he's cheating the other agents, sir. He may be a swindler but he's not that smart. So, what's he doing here? Are there any answers in your computer? - No, sir. - Let's go, then. Is there something wrong with what I?m wearing? Course not, Fred, you look great. By the way, what's today's date? - The fourteenth. - Ah, fourteen! One and four. I better find you a job since you need some cash. Order whatever you want. Yeah, you're looking for an exterminator? What's the salary? That's all? No thanks, we're not interested, bye. But, aren't we going after the killer? We still have to work in the meantime. We have to earn a living. Go ahead and eat. Someone told me he's in a retirement home. - I heard he died a long time ago. - Why didn't you say so? Excuse me, gentlemen. Have any of you seen Mr Leung lately? Ah, yes, Mr Leung! Yes, do you know where he is? Well, you should ask Mrs Leung about that. She knows everything. I bet! Thanks. Wait! We were just kidding. You're looking for old man Leung? That's right. - He's been missing for a while. - He hasn't come for tea in ages. Excuse me, enjoy your tea. Now there's a hard worker. Did you see all the pagers he had? - You ate all that? - No, I left this for you. How could you eat so much? I?ll deal with you later. What an appetite! Jim, what's new, a new target? Good! You gave the job to someone else? But I?ve got this guy, he's just come from America, he's really slick. How did i get him? He wanted to spend some time in South East Asia, so he came to Hong Kong to see his old friend. 50 thousand's fine. Of course not, he comes out in a rash if he doesn't kill regularly. Whoever gets him first, gets the money? OK, OK, count us in then. Who's the target? Yeah... Right... OK, get the money ready, thanks. What a pig! I eat three meals in one to save time. More like three months of meals. l think we'd better leave. - Wait, want take away? - Take away? The terms of our business agreement are as follows: Sometimes you may be required to maim a target. 8,000 for the left hand, 10,000 for a leg , and 20% discount for both legs. - And the right hand? - That's free. - Why? - It always gets in the way. So it ends up as a freebie. Why don't you look around for a while? What about you? I don't know the target, so I?ve got to find my informer. - But there's so many kids around. - Want me to chase them away first? Wait here. - I want some candy. - Give me a pink one. Just hit the tile and you win, go on! Aw, you missed! I can do it, watch. - Need some help? - No thanks. OK, if i lose your dollar, I?ll give you five back. Deal! Try number two tile, I want Big Bird! That one? Hooray! I won Big Bird! Here you are mister, toss another coin! - What number? - Try number one. - Here mister, try it again! - All right,
