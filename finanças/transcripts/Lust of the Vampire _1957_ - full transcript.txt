THE VAMPIRES Hey, you guys! There's a young woman who's drowned over here. A girl. Quick! Come and give me a hand! Just like the others. Not a drop of blood left in her. And yet we haven't found any wounds. All we know is she died before she was thrown in the river. This case seems identical to the others. TERROR STRIKES PARIS AGAIN MYSTERIOUS KILLER CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM FOUR GIRLS KILLED IN SIX MONTHS VAMPIRE CONTINUES HIS KILLING SPREE POLICE INVESTIGATION YIELDS NO CLUES IS THE MONSTER UNSTOPPABLE? INVESTIGATION BY PIERRE LATIN - Hi, Pierre. - Have you heard? - The Vampire's struck again. - Why do you care so much? You're a journalist, not a policeman. You're too involved. I know it looks like I'm obsessed, but I need to find out who he is. I know it would be the greatest scoop of all time. And they've made no progress on the case. I'm convinced this victim is the key to the whole mystery. Pierre? What are you thinking about? The next victim. Who will it be? Nora, aren't you going to get dressed? I'm reading Lantin's article. "She had been missing for two weeks, yet she'd only died a few hours before they found her." - Good heavens! - "Where was she all that time?" "What torments does the Vampire inflict on his victims?" The poor girl was only 18 years old. I'm off. What are you going to do? Are you coming, Lisette? - Just a minute. - Go on ahead. I'll catch up. Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Aren't you coming? - I'm going to stay a little longer. You really want to read that nasty paper? - No, I'm expecting a phone call. - A call from the Vampire? Don't joke about it! I'm upset enough. Giorgio called while we were on stage. He said I should wait here and he'd call back later. Fine. We'll see you at the usual bar. - OK, if I make it in time. - Bye. - Is anyone still up there? - Yes. Nora. - Nora? - What is it? Shut the door when you leave. I'll come by later and lock up. - OK. - It's the same thing every night! I never get out at a decent time. There's always some straggler. - Poor Michel! - And so I have to come back. - So you didn't see her leave? - No, Inspector. I went to get a bite to eat. She wasn't upstairs when I came back to lock up. Even her clothes were gone. Nobody's seen her since Tuesday night. Her friends, her fiancé, not even her landlady. I remember now that she was expecting a phone call. So she may have gone out to meet somebody. I happen to think she didn't leave the theatre at all, at least, not willingly. What are you doing here? It's my job to sniff out juicy stories. If you journalists just did your job, instead of playing cops and robbers, maybe our work wouldn't be so hard. Really? I might just have something you'd be interested in. May I? It's a draft copy of my article. I saved it for you. "Vampire kidnaps dancer from theatre." Don't you think you're getting a bit carried away? I can prove it. - Here. - What's that supposed to mean? That's Nora's shoe! I know because I took it to be repaired last week. - Where did you find it? - In the wings. Keep it. It's a present. It might come in useful. - Listen, you... - Don't get upset, I'm leaving. I'm going to snoop around elsewhere. Goodbye, Inspector. For now we've only got one clue of any significance. All the victims had the same blood type. Then you think they were chosen intentionally? We don't have much evidence to support a hypothesis like that, except perhaps the traces of needle marks on their bodies and the absence of any sign of struggle. But we mustn't read too much into these things. These days countless people know how to use a syringe. You don't need to be a doctor, just a patient. Just think how skilled drug addicts are. Now you're really groping in the dark. The vampire could be insane, or equally someone in full control of his mental faculties. Do you have any better ideas? Not yet, but I hope to soon. - Then, congratulations! - Thank you, Doctor. I see your collection is growing. - What's this? - The last photo of Nora. - Who gave it to you? - Her fiancé. Is he the man with her here? - Couldn't he be the... - Afraid not. - He's got a perfect alibi. - Too bad! I always find people who can cook up a perfect alibi all the more suspicious. Could you say where you were the evening of January 27th? - No. - You see? What would the symptoms be? Dilated pupils, shaky hands... What are you getting at? Nothing. Just something the doctor at the lab mentioned. I'm trying to picture the Vampire. Set your dismal fantasies aside for a moment and take a look at this splendid creature. I know her. She's the niece of the Duchess Du Grand. And that's how you treat her? I really don't understand you. Maybe you're the monster who feeds on human blood. It did all start when you came back to Paris. Don't talk nonsense! I'll better watch you, instead! - What's so interesting there? - Come here. - Look at this picture. - You've already shown it to me. - Did you see who's behind Nora? - A passer-by. - He's hiding his face. - You're imagining things. To me, he's just a guy whose face is covered. Maybe. But I can't afford to overlook the slightest clue. Do you know that the girl found in the Seine used to go to the "Joan of Arc" school? - Who told you that? - Her mother. You sent me to see her, remember? - Where are you going? - To talk with her classmates. Come! - Wait for me here. - All right. Miss, may I have a word with you? - Bravo, Lorette! - Sorry. It was a bet. She said she'd slap the first person who came up to her. - That was you. - Thanks very much! - Did I hurt you? - Just a little. Lucky for me you used your left hand or you'd have knocked my head off. - On the contrary. I'm left-handed. - Guess I'm not so lucky after all. - My name is Pierre Lantin. - The journalist? Precisely. I wanted to ask you a few questions about your classmate. - Mireille? - The girl they found in the Seine. Do you remember anything unusual about her? She'd only been here for a few days. We told the police everything except... - Except what? - You tell him, Lorette. A man was following us one day, or at least I thought he was. - Go on. - That's it. I told my friends and we came up with the bet. What did this man look like? He was tall and thin. That's all I remember. He looked a lot like you. Or perhaps like this man? Yes, he was wearing an overcoat. This isn't very clear, though. Do you think you would recognise him, if you saw him again? I think so. He had a dazed look. Like you when Lorette slapped you! Listen, I may need your help. Can we fix a time for another meeting? I wouldn't want to risk getting slapped again. Well, you know where I go to school. Pierre! - Excuse me, please. Goodbye. - Goodbye! - Hello, Giselle. - Hello, Pierre. It's been impossible to find you lately. I'm hurt by the way you've neglected me. Sorry, but my work leaves no time for distractions. You seem to find time to flirt with young students. I don't know what you mean. You're mistaken. A man always denies these things. I should probably pretend to believe you, but I'm no good at pretending. Listen, Giselle, I'm here on newspaper business. You don't have to explain yourself. I only ask that you come by to see me occasionally. - I can't promise right now. - I understand. I'll call your boss and ask him to make you write a story on the castle. Then you can go there on newspaper business too. All right, I'll stop by. Goodbye. Goodbye. - What did she want? - She wants me to go to the castle. How can you say that so casually? The most beautiful woman in Paris makes eyes at you, and you don't even care? - It's a long family story. - I'm not interested in her. - Well, I am! She's much more interesting than your investigation. Introduce me to her and I promise I'll turn this city upside down until I find your vampire. A fix! I need a fix! You'll get one... later. Do you understand? She goes to rehearsals every day at four at 5, Rue St. Étienne. This is her. You know her, her name's Lorette. Don't forget. Rue St. Étienne. You know what you have to do? Yes. Give me my fix! I'm going crazy! I'm going crazy! You can have all you want... later. This will be enough for now. - I'll try not to be long. - Don't worry, I'll be waiting. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - That's fine. - Thank you. Excuse me, is Mr. Berthier in? As I said, when he saw me, he did everything he could to get away. He was afraid. Look. You can see it in his face. - Are you sure this was the house? - Sure. Look. I even took a picture of it. Let's have a look. - Hello. - Can I help you? I'm Inspector Chantal. I'd like to speak to this gentleman. I don't know who he is. - What? Doesn't he live here? - I've never seen him before. That's impossible. He came to the door 20 minutes ago. I haven't left the house all day and I haven't had any visitors. I'm a retired policeman. I lost my arm in the line of duty. - You can take my word for it. - There was a window there. A window? That's been walled up for years. - But you're welcome to take a look. - Thank you. We're sorry. There's obviously been a mix-up. The houses around here do all look alike. Goodbye. I swear I saw him. I talked to him! I'm not crazy! No, you're not crazy... you're worse. You're a meddler looking for publicity at any cost. Take your picture back, but if you dare print it, I'll throw you in... This was the street. The first one after the traffic barrier. Let's go. ROADWORKS - Hey, who moved this barrier? - Somebody could get killed. Give me a hand. SALUS CLINIC I'm sorry, sir, but Professor Du Grand isn't receiving visitors today. - What do you want? - You know very well. - Professor, Joseph's here. - What? He won't leave. I think you'd better see him. All right. Show him in. You insisted on seeing me. Why? I have to leave town. I want some money. A lot of money. Or else I'll tell them everything. I don't know what you're talking about. Get a syringe. He needs to calm down. I'll tell them everything. They're on my trail! - Stop yelling! - I won't take the fall for you. I only did what you told me to. But now I know who you are and I swear you won't get away with it. - What have you done? - It was the only way to shut him up. So he showed up here. I expected it all along. Now the police will be on your trail. They could arrest you any time now. How did he find us? It would be a sad ending for the illustrious Professor Julien Du Grand and ruin for all of us. There's only one way to save your name and your past. You know what that is. Yes, Margherita. A GREAT LOSS FOR MANKIND PROFESSOR JULIEN DU GRAND DIES UNEXPECTEDLY Her cousin's unexpected death must have been a terrible blow for the duchess. Absolutely. She was very fond of the professor and he owed so much to her. Julien's family hardly had any money left. It was Margherita who paid for his schooling. He fell madly in love with her, but she always thought of him as a brother. - I don't see the duchess's niece. - Giselle? She doesn't go to funerals. Besides, she's away on a trip. - I was hoping to meet Giselle. - I'm sure you were. You've only had eyes for her since she moved back here. She doesn't spend much time at the castle. Don't worry, she'll be back soon. I understand he was a relative, but she's taking the mourning too far. She always wears those veils. Surely she doesn't wear them at home. No one has seen her face in years. She was a very beautiful woman and she can't deal with getting old. Her love for my father was partly to blame. It isn't like that. My father hated her. He wanted nothing to do with her. I'll bet! She must have been much older than him. She was a heartless woman who destroyed my mother's life. Turn it on. - What are you trying to do? - Be quiet. It's an experiment. I want to isolate his organs and extend their life while they're still intact. I'll use this device to oxygenate the blood artificially, without relying on the body itself which now lies dead and inert. Some day, I'll discover the very energy that generates life and make it flow forever through the living beings. That will be my moment of triumph, because it will mean that all my work was not in vain. - Who's there? - It's me. The moment has come. Get everything ready for tonight. I'm not ready yet. It could be dangerous to proceed now. I'm not afraid, and Giselle needs to be here tomorrow. At least let me try my experiment. I can't wait. All right. Turn it off. André. Get them to bring the car right away. I want to go out. Yes, Duchess. Please, just a moment. I'm sorry to disturb you. Would you do me a big favour? Of course. I need to deliver this letter. It's urgent. In my condition, I can't move very quickly. If you would be so kind... It's for a good cause. - Lorette, hurry up! - What are you doing? Just a minute. - Shall we wait for her? - At this point... It's next to the Church of the Sacred Heart. The name's on the envelope. Thank you. God will reward you. You're very kind. - Didn't he kiss you? - What? - Pierre would never flirt with me. - That upsets you, doesn't it? You two are unbearable. Bye. - Aren't you coming with us? - I've got an errand to run. - For Pierre? - Stop it! Bye. - Bye, Lorette. - Bye. Excuse me, does Mrs. Chabert live here? First floor. Can I help you? A blind man in the street asked me to deliver this letter to Mrs. Chabert. - He said it was urgent. - Come in, please. Madam is afraid of burglars. We have to be understanding. Follow me. I'll let Madam know you're here. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's Lorette being late for lunch. It's never happened before. She's always on time. - I'm really starting to get worried. - Don't overreact. I'm just sorry she's made this gentleman wait. - You'll have to excuse her. - No need for that. - She didn't know I was stopping by. - We could call the school. I already did. She left almost two hours ago. We should call the police, the hospitals. Maybe she's been run over and can't talk. Don't be so dramatic, darling. She's just late, that's all. If only I could do something or had an idea where to look for her! I've looked everywhere. Somebody must have seen her. Listen, go home. There's nothing more you can do here. - You haven't found any trace of her? - No. She's my only child. The idea that she's disappeared is driving me crazy. With all that's been going on recently, I don't want to think about it, but what if she's been... Every policeman on the force is looking for her. Calm down. Go to your wife. She'll be needing your support. Lorette may show up quicker than you think. Inspector. Mr. Lantin. I'd like a word with you. You are interested in that girl because you think she know something, right? More or less. Don't you think you might have drawn someone's attention to her? Forget about your newspaper for once. Have a bit of compassion for her parents. They certainly need it. I'm afraid those poor people are in for a terrible shock. Help! Help! I called out to her and I saw him hand her a letter. She left us later, saying she had an errand to run. - That's all. - I see. Come. Are you sure this is the man? Sure. Thank you. You can go now. Show her out. - So do you still deny it? - I... I didn't know what was going to happen. A man gave me 1,000 francs just to deliver that letter and remember the address. - I never imagined... - So you know where she went? - Of course. - Where? 46 Rue de la Fortresse. The first floor. We should have known. The building's empty. It's about to be knocked down. The apartment was just being used as a trap. They set it all up perfectly. - Hey, Pierre. - What is it? - The boss wants to see you. - I'll be right there. Hurry, the ogre's furious. Who knows what you've done now! - Hello, Mr. Bourgeois. - Hello. Listen here, Lantin! You're destroying this newspaper. You're always talking about scoops and new evidence, but what have you found out? Nothing we don't already know! - If that's what you think... - You're being reassigned. - Listen, sir... - I'm not discussing this anymore. The Duchess Du Grand's niece has written to me. They're giving a reception at the castle tonight and she wants you to cover it for the social column. Send someone else in my place, please. I don't generally cover that sort of story and I've got other things to do. Are you joking? I'm trailing someone that I'm almost certain is the killer. I'm sorry, but this evening you'll go to the ball at the Du Grand castle. You won't be writing another line about murder cases. All right. You're the boss. - Exactly. - Goodbye. Poor Margherita! This party must be very difficult for her. I was sure she wouldn't come. The last ball she hosted was in 1925. It was in '29, dear. No, I'd swear it was in '25. I remember because it was the year she suffered that great disappointment and never wanted to see anyone again. Yet she used to enjoy having a good time, just like her niece does now. If you only knew what a chore it is for me coming here! Why? I'm delighted to be here. I'm beginning to suspect you have terrible taste. - Have you looked around? - Thank you. You always seem to forget about Giselle. Every time I see her, she looks more beautiful. I don't understand how she can live in a place like this. Stay here, if you like. I'm going out on the terrace. - Excuse me, I'm a little tired. - Of course. Why are you hiding out here? I don't like dancing and I'm not dressed for it. I feel out of place among all those people. Doesn't my being here cheer you up a little bit? What's wrong? Why are you looking at me that way? Your voice sounds different today, like someone who... - I'm sure you're not interested. - You don't seem to think much of me. I think you're a spoilt and selfish girl. - Then why did you come? - You know very well. I belong to the class known as slaves, who must scrupulously obey the orders they receive. - I fear I'm boring you. - On the contrary. - Your guests will be looking for you. - My guests! I hate them! A bunch of dried-up mummies is what they are. I despise the idea of becoming one of them. - I couldn't stand it. - You could do what your aunt does. You don't understand. You have no idea what a woman goes through. - Especially a woman in love. - Giselle... Sometimes you act like a silly girl, though I know you're not. Why do you behave in that way? It's amazing how much you resemble your father. How can you say that? You couldn't have met him. My aunt has a picture of him that she guards jealously. She must have loved your father very much. She never stops talking about him, as if he were the greatest man ever to walk the earth. Most people will never know that kind of love. If I were able to love like that... no obstacle could keep me from achieving my dream. Are you sure? I'm sure. My aunt has an attack every so often. We don't want people to know it. She has a terrible, incurable disease. That's why she behaves so strangely. Why did you scream? It's no use, you know. No one can hear you. I want to leave this place. I want to go home. Stop yelling, you silly girl! You silly girl. I don't want to hurt you, but you mustn't push me. Your life is hanging by a thread. Don't break it. Do you understand? The Count and Countess de la Roche want to say goodbye. Tell them I'm busy at the moment. I will join them as soon as I can. Now you know everything about me. Won't you tell me something about yourself? I'm sorry, but I have to go. I must get back to the newspaper. Thank you for inviting me. Good night. Pierre! Wait for me, Pierre! Why are you leaving? What happened? I don't want to lead Giselle on. It would be dishonest. That's true. So you won't mind, if I try to console her? Go ahead. I don't know why, but I can't stand her or this castle. I don't feel the same way. I really like her. - Have you called the paper? - No, I had no reason to. - Are you expecting any news? - No. I can't stop thinking about Lorette. You see, Ronald... - I feel kind of guilty. - I understand. Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow in the office. I'm staying here. - See you. - Bye. Don't be afraid. I want you to get some rest now. - It's best for you and for us. - I don't want to! Stop making such a racket. That's enough! I'm doing it for your own good, after all. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you. I'm beautiful! Pierre. You! What are you doing here? What do you want? Just to admire you in silence, nothing more. - You're out of your mind! - It's all because of you. Since the moment I first saw you, I wanted to meet you, and since I met you, I do nothing but dream about you. And you think that's reason enough for this impudence? It's all I have, and it's enough for me. If I'd followed the rules and knocked at the door, would that have made it all right? - Are you kidding? Certainly not about the way I feel. Is it so hard for you to believe that a man could fall in love with you? You are so beautiful! Immensely beautiful. Leave at once or I'll call for help. Just a minute. You think I don't know your secret? It's the same secret that has consumed your aunt's life. What do you mean? A disease passed down the generations. Love for the Lantins. Your aunt was in love with Pierre's father. - You're in love with Pierre. - That's enough! You're insulting me. Giselle, forget about Pierre. It's no use. Leave at once or my servants will throw you out. It would not be pleasant, I assure you. - Let go of me! Let go of me, I said! - Giselle. Go away or you'll be sorry. Get out of my room immediately! I never want to see you again. Do you understand? Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me, I said! I don't want you to look at me. I know I'm old and ugly. This is the real me. I'm Duchess Margherita Du Grand. I became young again, at the cost of human life, just for that man's love. I couldn't let him get away like I let his father get away! So I deceived everyone and became Giselle. I'll carry on because you won't say a word! - What are you doing? - You shouldn't have come here! Go and see what's happened. I hate you! Hurry! Take him away. Did you hear me? Take him away and get rid of him. No, you mustn't ask me to do this. I can't work miracles. You have to find a way, Julien. You promised me. You told me you had discovered the secret of eternal youth. Now all of a sudden, you say you can't help me anymore. It's too late to back out now. Death doesn't frighten me, if the alternative is to go on living like this. Don't say that! I've done everything I can. You have to try again. Be reasonable. You've seen for yourself. The effects are increasingly short-lived. Strong emotions can shatter their power. I have experiments underway to overcome this obstacle, but the results aren't reliable. You might harm yourself, if you tried it now. If you were in a calmer state, it might work, but, as things are, the risk is too great. I told you I don't care. I can't let go of my youth. I can't let go of my beauty. - Try the experiment. - This is insane! You won't survive! Come on! What are you waiting for? As you wish. But I've warned you. Professor, she's dead. No, thankfully she is only fainted. - Pierre! - Hello, Giselle. Hello. It seems we're destined to run into each other when we least expect it. There must be secret ties binding us, or maybe I'm just guided by my desire to see you. I don't set much store by destiny, in some cases at least. You aren't nice to me. As punishment, you're going to come with me. - Very well! - This way. - Hello. - Hello. I've come to pick up the picture you mentioned... - Of course. Come with me. - Thank you. Bring it over here. Here we are. It's a marvellous painting! To tell you the truth, I'll be sorry to part with it. It's beautiful, but are you sure it's authentic? Do you think I would offer something to the Duchess Du Grand, if I wasn't absolutely certain of its authenticity? I'm the one buying it, actually. To me, you and the duchess are one and the same. Really? I didn't realise you were such a perceptive man. - Thank you. - So how much is it? 850,000 francs. Isn't that a bit much? For a painting by Francesco Guardi? Very well. Have it brought to my car. I didn't know you were left-handed. It's true. I'm pretty groggy this morning. I have to write with my left hand. Who knows what's wrong with me today! Thank you. - Sorry, I have another engagement. - Alright, I have things to do too. - Goodbye, Pierre. - Goodbye. My regards, miss. Had you ever noticed she was left-handed? Left-handed? No. Now that you mention it... But I'd never noticed. - May I use your phone? - By all means! Hello? Hotel Angleterre? I'd like to speak to Mr. Ronald Fontaine. Sorry, but Mr. Fontaine didn't come back last night. Or this morning. Thank you. Listen, Lantin, you've pulled my leg once too often with your clues and vampire photos, and we both know where they've led. How can I take you seriously? Ronald has been missing since last night. I don't like that castle either, the Du Grand family is very strange, but that's not sufficient grounds for a search. I can't make you see things my way, but I'm absolutely certain that the key to this mystery lies in that castle. Do you have any kind of proof at all? Not the kind you want, but I'll get it. I'll go to the castle myself. - Yes? - Julien, maybe you were right. - What? - I feel ill. - I'm afraid my heart might give out. - Oh, Margherita! Don't worry. I'll be right there. Who's there? Who's there? Stop! Please take me away from here. Take me away from this place. He's the man I followed. I found him running away from the castle. Tell us your name, at least. Come on, what's your name? My name is... Joseph Signoret. They made me help them... and then they killed me. What? You're insane! - Do you expect me to believe that? - Let him finish. That's enough! You've gone too far. If you think these pranks are funny, you're completely mistaken. Now... when you claim they forced you to help them, who are you referring to? I didn't want to kidnap them. They made me do it. They're the real murderers. Those wretched scoundrels should pay the price. Quick, call a doctor! Hurry! The police! Turn out the lights. I said turn out the lights! Joseph has escaped. How did this happen? Who could have betrayed us? - Can I help you? - Police. - We want to speak to the duchess. - The duchess has gone away. - Ask her niece to come down. - Good evening. It must be a very urgent matter, if you've decided to disturb me at this unlikely hour. Even policemen have to know what good manners are. Circumstances obliged me to do it. I've been informed that unusual things have been taking place in this castle. Did Mr. Lantin bring you here? Yes, it's the first time I've set foot willingly in this castle, and for your sake and mine, I hope it's the last. I can't imagine what this gentleman could have told you to convince you to come here. I know that my lifestyle arouses a lot of criticism. People invent the most absurd lies, and your friend here has been particularly active in that regard, ever since I rejected his clumsy advances. - How dare you? - Miss... I actually came here to see your aunt and I'm disappointed not to find her. Therefore, I ask you to hear me out and answer my questions. You mustn't be afraid. Don't run away! Come with me. I'll get you out of here. No! Don't touch me! I don't know any Joseph Signoret. As for the photographer Mr. Lantin mentioned, he left last night with the other guests. One more question. Is Mr. Robert's daughter here in the castle? I can only say this is the first time I've heard that name. - But that's... - Mr. Lantin! I'd like you to understand my situation and allow me to search the castle. If that will help rid me of this gentleman once and for all, I will gladly give you permission. Look around all you like. With Mr. Lantin as your guide, I'm sure you'll make some exciting discoveries. - Be my guest. - Thank you. You go that way. Come with us. - Not a thing. - Nothing here either. This can't be! That man told us... Let's go. There should be a chapel around here. There it is! - Well? - I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me. You're not giving up the search? Upset by yet another failure? Just a moment! Who's there? It's us, Inspector. An underground passage connects the Du Grand family chapel to the castle. "I shall conquer hell." A strange motto. My ancestors adopted it during the Crusades. As for the passageway, we've known about it for centuries. It was customary for noble families to have direct access to their chapel. - I don't think it's a crime. - Nobody said it was. - Call the men. Let's go. - You're making a mistake. I'm certain this woman is lying. Carry on with your questions. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Good night. The man I found here admitted to kidnapping the girls. - Why won't you believe him? - Stop bothering me, Lantin. Inspector, look over there! Why are you looking at me like that? What's wrong with you? You've no right to insult me. You'll be sorry, I tell you. Leave! Leave at once! Quick! Seal off all the exits from the castle. Search the place from top to bottom! No one must escape. This way! It's the only way out. - I heard footsteps. They're coming. - It won't open. There's a passageway here that we didn't see before. Stop! Professor Du Grand! So his death, his funeral... Quick, to the chapel! Open the tomb. It's a real miracle! She's extremely weak but otherwise fine. Don't worry. She needs medical attention, but she'll be all right. Is that you, Pierre? How do you feel? I don't know. Now that you're here, I understand it's finally over. From now on, it will be nothing but a terrible dream. That's right, Lorette. Try to rest now. I'll stay here with you. I've thought about you a lot over the last few days. Pierre, I want to get out of this place. I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. You're not alone anymore. - My mother... - I called her. You'll see her soon. What about the duchess? She died ten minutes ago. She confessed her crimes. I owe you an apology for my behaviour, this evening. I knew you were right as soon as we entered the castle. On the other hand, I was taking quite a risk coming here without a search warrant. One false move would have been disastrous. I was desperately hoping that something would happen that would authorise me to take the next step. The duchess was a very cunning woman. She deceived us all with her double identity. Ronald Fontaine discovered her secret. That's why he didn't leave here alive. That may have been the duchess's only mistake. Who was the man I found here? Nothing but a pawn. They tried to get rid of him, but he was dead in appearance only. The experiments they carried out on him suddenly reawakened the vital force in him. With your help we've managed to bring this terrible chapter to a close forever. My deepest thanks, Inspector. I'm not the one you should be thanking. - Thank him. - Words fail me. Sometimes the heart knows better than the head. How about a cup of coffee? I'm an expert at this!
