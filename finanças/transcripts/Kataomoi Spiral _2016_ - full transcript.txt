Yui, isn't this romantic? Another corny one? Sorry. Train delayed again? Nah, I slept in. You're on probation, remember? You're a hard taskmaster, Yui. Ah, thanks dude. What's the topic? You heard last week. The series on unrequited love. You liked it the most, Misaki. "Everybody's Got a Crush." We got too many submissions. Misaki, help us select them. Sure. Check this one out. "Unrequited Love" Thanks for choosing my favorite. Nice choice. Is the rumor true? What rumor? Misaki's estranged wife found a younger boyfriend. So what? Misaki was a popular singer 10 years ago. My mom was a big fan. Actually, so am I, secretly. So I'm a little sad... Misaki, it's time. Over to you. Toru Misaki's "Round Midnight." Good evening. Bringing you jazzy vibes from Bay Studio, it's time for Toru Misaki's ""Round Midnight." For the next seven weeks, we'll be bringing you sad tales of unrequited love sent in by our listeners. Now then, to start off, here's one from Annya in Sagamihara. Its title: "MY NICKNAME is BUTATCHI." Act like a girl! Your face woke me up. Be a man and pretend it didn't! You got exams too? Two days with no sleep. Only radio. "All-Night... ...Nippon!" You listen too? Yesterday... It won't help you study. You used to be cute, Satake. Right back at you. Back at you too. And back again. Whatever you say. You know, you never used to be cute, Nomura. You collected scabs, freak. Like hell I did. You did, "Butatchi." And whose fault was all those scabs? Hey, what I meant was, you're cuter now. Seriously Nomura, are you keeping up in school? I've always been lagging behind. Who needs math anyway? Not with a calculator. Even more seriously... What? Find a girl for me. You've gotta help me, Nomura! You go to girls school! A group date! Not with exams coming up. We need summer fun too, like in a pop song. Go listen to some. It's our last summer. Exams aren't everything! Go join a band! Drop the pop angle. Try telling all that to your uncle and aunt. Like I could. They'd kill me! Wait up! Hey, Nomura! Butatchi! Shut up! I'm cramming! You'll make me forget! Boys need love too! Don't talk to me Satake, you jerkoff! I remember first semester fondly. You listening? I'm listening! I'm begging you! Careful! Stop it! I still rode my bike. That day a few months back seems so long ago now. I'm sorry. Please have my seat. Sorry. When did Satake start calling me Nomura? He gave me my nickname. He still uses it sometimes. It's no wonder I get confused. "Self-study. This time is the crossroads of your exam fortunes." Oh man, these are garbage. Or maybe not! Yay! Game over, suckers! Hey Kanzaki! I'll win you a meal coupon too. Thanks, but I don't think I can eat. I got bad cramps this month. Painkillers? Took 'em. 100 years ago. But it still hurts? Like a bitch. That's a bitch. My period was late anyway, so at least it came. Forget it. Hey, I used protection. That's it? What? Which is it? Huh? Anyway Nomura, could you massage my back? A meal coupon per 10 minutes. Okay okay! Deal, deal! So that's it. They were doing it. Dumbass! Diarrhea face! I'm sorry. Sorry, Butatchi. For what? I mean, you'll get scabs again. I wouldn't if you changed, Satake. I wish I could change too. So when will you? Tomorrow. That Satake. I knew that day would come sometime, but seeing it would hurt like a bitch. Hey! That hurts! Sorry! Enough with the heys. Gimme one. Nah. Then gimme two. Why should I? Forgot your eternal debt? The past isn't eternal. Gimme! Alright. Chosen a university? I will tomorrow. You'll say the same the day after that! You were so cool, Butatchi. I forgot all that already. First, there's the pattern in which a being verb comes before "there." In this case, something or someone is present. That's what it means. Here, the being verb is "was," so it's in the past tense. Sir, can I use the bathroom? So, how you feeling? Better than yesterday. Glad to hear it. Tell me a funny period story. Nothing's funny about periods. Listening to music? Unicorn. "Not-So-Wonderful Days." They did a song called that? Satake sang it the first time I went to karaoke with you two. We didn't go together. He was there with his high school buddies. After mid-year exams. Did I mess up then? How? Suggesting we go to karaoke. I wanted to go. So it didn't matter. Honestly, I don't care about anyone else. We all split up in spring. We're not teens for long anyway. But you... Anna Nomura is in a class of her own. What do you mean? Friendship, and... ...love. I made you take the bus. I wanted to anyway. But there was a reason why. Anyway, I hate that I won't hear your voice anymore. This gravelly voice? It's awesome. So what? So you... You and Satake... Sorry. You shouldn't say any more. That's not fair. It's so not fair. Thanks. Don't you mean "sorry"? I mean it. Thanks. I wish you were a bitch, Kanzaki! I am a bitch! This hurts like a bitch. That's a bitch. Hey... isn't that my line? I wanted to say it. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. After all this time, you make that face? I'm thinking about university. Oh. Did you decide? Did you? I'm asking. You'll go where Kanzaki goes? Well, I'll probably go that way. If I can get good grades. What's your way? Stop saying "way." I might draw lots. You're as random as Pee-wee Herman. Hey, his randomness is totally thought out. Get that straight. You get it straight. Shut up, crybaby. I miss the old Butatchi. Shut up, ass-flasher. Hey, tone it down. Want some? I guess. You get none! Buy your own. Hey! Want me to come? Nah. So much for being kind. Buy a new bike! Your stolen one's not coming back. Whatever! See ya 'round. Satake! Let's play tag again! I'll chase you, okay? No way, dumbass! Come on! No way. Yes way? Man, I'm beat. Can't keep up, Nomura? Shut up. You're slow! Give me... a chance! You used to be faster! Don't you know this is sexist? Riding the bus made you weak. Catch me! Dumbass! Ow! Hey! You gotta be kidding me! Hey! You know that song? Misaki did the vocals for it. Let's open with it. Misaki won't like that one bit. We shouldn't surprise him. He's never played his songs before. Why not? Maybe because it hurts to remember. What? Is me being on time such a big deal? For week two, we have a letter from Nobody in Kawasaki. Its title: "my sweet cactus." "my sweet cactus" Yeah, 'morning. Good morning. Hey new boy. You've been here half a year, but you come late? I'm so sorry! And you're loud... Jab, jab, jab, jab. Why are her words always so barbed? Imai. Got a second? I've worked at this ad agency for six months. That woman keeps stinging me with her words. Saki Imai, 31. Quick-witted, and efficient. Snap out of it. We're going. Okay! And then there's me. I hate to admit it... Even so, yesterday, I rubbed one out thinking of her. Put your necktie on first. Okay. What were you expecting? You looked at me blankly. Hiding something? Plus, she's perceptive. Hiding something? You bet your ass! But I can't tell her she's the reason I was late. Aw, crap! What?! Nothing. You yell about nothing? I'm sorry. Weirdo. What a bitch! She's a bitch, and yet... Men are pathetic creatures. Good to see you. What is it? I'm sorry. The brochures... What? You forgot the brochures? Listen up. You've got no right to wallow in self-pity. If you've got time for that, work on improving yourself! Hey. When will you bloom? What are you doing? Huh? My cactuses. I revived a dying cactus once that someone had brought in. Then more people started sneakily leaving their ailing cactuses here. It's surprising how many people have cactuses. If you can't care for it, don't buy it. Before I knew it, I ended up as the office cactus keeper. I never noticed there were cactuses here. You're too blinkered to notice much at all. Oh, someone left this one here when you joined the company. It was 80% near death. The poor thing. It struggled hard, but was ignored. Now it's budding, and hanging in there. Okay! I'm calling it "Nobody," and making it your rival. Will it blossom first, or will you show progress first? Don't get left behind! They said they're going with D.U. Create instead. I should have checked myself. I'm terribly sorry. Listen. If he's dragging you down, shall I replace him? It was such an elementary mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. Training him is my responsibility. Really? Just make sure you don't blow your big break. I'm trusting you. Hey Nobody. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's come over you? Ms. Imai? You're still here? I can't go home... if you're still here. This isn't beer... Oh, sorry. I'm kidding. It suddenly lost its spirit. Hang in there. Make sure you blossom. Okay. I wasn't talking to you! Oh, sorry! At that moment, I realized I wanted to see her smile. Have some coffee. Thanks... Hey, is it true you majored in urban engineering? Er, yes, I did... Want to do a competitive presentation for Mizusawa Home? Yes, I'd like to. It's a big account. Okay! Work hard. I think I worked harder than I ever did before. I gave it my absolute all. Okay! It has a futuristic concept as an innovative multipurpose facility where local resources, exciting content, and value are rediscovered. As our brochure shows... Imai! Congratulations. You won. We did it! We did it! Well done, Kinoshita. No more screw-ups, okay? Thank you! Congratulations! We did it. Imai, about that thing... Right. Er... What's going on? It seems like you can handle things now, so I'm... ...going to New York. It's finally on? New York?! Congratulations! Imai! Congratulations! You prepared this? Thank you! Everyone knew? You were too blinkered to notice. Working hard, huh? It was decided a while ago. But you took time to settle into your job, so... What? You're not going to congratulate me? It's a promotion. It's an American-style farewell. I wanted to watch over you more. Now it's your chance to shine... Oh come on. Be a man. Okay, I'm going. My heart was stinging again. Misaki? What are you doing? I went walking and ended up drinking. Your wife'll worry... She's long gone, and I live alone. So I'm enjoying my freedom. I don't envy your lifestyle at all. Thanks to you passing by, I won't be late for work now. Do you always rely on luck? My luck left me a long time ago. Wait a minute. Does meeting you here like this mean you're... I'm not your lady luck. What if I was a little younger, and a popular singer? You don't have to be young, or popular. You're fine as you are. You mean that? Of course I mean it. But don't get me wrong. Come on, you'll be late! For week three, a letter from Fumi in Fujisawa. Its title: "Something Blue." It refers to a western custom. Brides wear something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue, for good luck. "Something Blue" represents one such item. "Something Blue" "To Nozomi" "Dear Nozomi. "I'm sorry for suddenly talking to you in sign language. "I'm sorry I didn't know you couldn't understand it. "Even so, I want you to understand this. "You're a very special client to me. "Actually, until recently, I felt like I was going nowhere. "I became a stylist, and opened my own salon, "which should have felt like my dream came true. "But to be honest, a lot went wrong, and I couldn't handle it. "Then you came into my salon. "Your smile made me realize. "I needed to remember what's most important. "First, I had to value my clients. "The more I did, the more things improved, "and now both my staff and my clients smile. "You made that happen, Nozomi. I'm deeply grateful to you. "That's why you're special to me. "Please come and let me cut your hair again sometime. I'm looking forward to seeing you. From Shinichi Nagase." Isn't that wonderful? I've lost... ...my hearing, so will people still want me around? "I'm sorry for the other day." "Thank you for coming." "Are you free tomorrow?" "That was your girlfriend?" "We're getting married in September." "Please stop by for a haircut soon." I know it's hard for you now, but I think you'll come to regret it later. Why don't you tell him that you're happy for him? Mr. Nagase will be doing your hair and makeup. Really? I can do sign language now. Do you remember it? I'm glad I could see you again. Have you been happy? I'm happy. I'm happy for you! Sorry! Isn't it bad if the director's late? Why are you here already? He's mended his ways. He said this show's his identity now. That's right. I was given this radio show gig. I ain't losing it for being late. Plus, Kitani's got the hots for me. Huh?! When did I ever say that? You said so. I never did! What's wrong with your ears? Nothing's wrong with them. Gimme the script. For week four, a letter from Seo-yeon in Yokohama. Its title: "One-sided love spiral." In this country, if you dress like a man, nobody glares at you, or makes fun of you. "One-sided love spiral" To go where people mind their own business, I studied Japanese furiously. Eventually, I became an exchange student. But I wanted to save on rent. The looks I got at this guesthouse were the same as the ones I got in South Korea. No smoking here. Sorry. Come, come! You can smoke out here. This might be a good time for me to quit. You're Kim, right? Your Japanese is really good! Call me Seo-yeon. I canceled the hotel I'd booked, and drank with Yuki all night. Catch you later. Good night! Ray fin? - Stingray fin. - Stingray fin? I decided to start life as an exchange student here. Yo, Seo-yeon. Yo, Hajime. What? ask questions in Korean.> Seo-yeon! Yuki! Bought something? Today was payday, so I went to buy a book, and got a bunch more. Is that normal in Japan? Making fun of me? We're going drinking. Want to come? He's just a rich know-nothing, so don't let him bug you. Don't make fun of her. That's the way, Hajime. A man's gotta sacrifice. You just made that up. Seo-yeon! I'm not drinking with that guy! - "That guy"? - Literature's literature! Tasty stingray fin. It was tasty? Stingray fin! You drank too much. Bed? Yuki? Hey. Hey Seo-yeon! Does Hajime have a girlfriend? I bet he does. Hajime. What do you think of Yuki? What do I think? I mean, do you think she's average? Cute? Well, she's cute, I guess. She's surprisingly cute without her glasses. Would you mind going on a date with her? Yuki? It'd be her first date, so make it a good memory. That'd be enough. This is enough. Even if I go against my own feelings, it's still my life. That's what I told myself, time and time again. No way. It's too sudden! Why? I mean... Where do I walk, and how? A step back on the right? Left? Just walk beside him. After you. A gentleman will walk next to the road, between traffic and the woman. I think Hajime will be alright. Should I kinda... hold his hand? Eat together, and talk about whatever. You both like novels, so just speak your mind. Walk side-by-side again, and if he offers his hand, hold it. A first date's too soon for a kiss, right? You don't have to tell each other how you feel. But if you feel like it, it'll happen naturally. I feel at ease with you, but... It won't be easy, but I'll try! Thanks, Seo-yeon. Hey Yuki, you're early. What's wrong, Yuki? What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing at all. I mean, I had no idea that meeting him with you and on my own would be so different. It's over already. I couldn't do it. I couldn't lead her on. You wanted me to do it for her, right? I wish you'd thought of me a little too. I did it for you. I did it for you, Seo-yeon. Let it go. It's not worth it. You're a chick? Goddamn freak. Seo-yeon? What's wrong? What happened? Does it hurt? I'm okay. Really? Really. Okay. Coincidence? If not a coincidence, an ambush? I thought last time was a coincidence, but I didn't know you live here. I don't live here. I come here too sometimes. No need for excuses. You always jump to conclusions. People often do things without a reason, or without realizing, or understanding. Sorry for not believing you. You're teasing me again. You're so contrary. She sees right through me, this young lass. Don't call me a lass. Okay. You'll be late. For week six, a letter from... It's week five. Let's go again. Sure. For week five, a letter from Zoo in Yokohama. Its title: "My secret love." "My secret love." Only human trash comes here. That goes for me too. The future doesn't matter. If the present's fun, if I'm having fun, that's enough. It sucks tonight. I had a look before, but no cute guys. I know. What's up? Let's drink. Okay. What's your name? Mana. Mana? Nice. I'm Yuki. How old are you? It's a secret. Every girl says it's a secret. That's empty. I'll buy you one. I'm taken. No kidding. So am I. So, what'll you have? I'm not really taken. I lie for a reason. I lie when the guy's a player. I'm taken. Players want girls who are cool. A drama-free one night stand. I told lies like that everyday. I'm taken. You are? I met Makoto a week ago. I was blind drunk, and he helped me home. Of course. No wonder you're taken. Well, we don't get on very well though... Oh right. Thanks for the muffler. Thank you too. You were honest with me. It's hard to find an honest girl. I'm glad you're not the kind of girl who lies. So, you don't get on? Tell me about it, if it'd help. Well... He's heartless. Heartless? Yeah. He does heartless things? Heartless things? He doesn't listen, and stuff. Makoto's earnest eyes stole my heart in an instant. "Thanks for today. Can I see you again?" "Huh? You sure? What about your guy? You want advice about him??" "Yes! You're easy to talk to." What the hell am I doing? "Sure! Let me know whenever I can help!" Oh, sorry. I'm late. You've got work. No, it's no problem. So what happened? "Thanks for today, Makoto." "Try to get along! I'm on your side." Anyway, do you go to nightclubs a lot? I don't. I met you on my first time. Oh, really? So, how was it? Well, it's not my style. No reason either. No reason? To go. "Got a little time?" "What's up? Fight?" "No big deal... Can I tell you?" "OK, I finish work soon." "See you at the usual place." Thanks for waiting. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Thanks. Waited long? Just got here. Makoto always replied right away. But he never sent me messages first. What's this? Mana, you're in love? No no no no! Don't worry. A guy can't ruin our friendship. Seeing you less will suck though. But I'm glad you're happy. For real? You bet. Hey ladies. You're totally cute. How old are you? What do you think? It's cold out. Shall we go? Not yet. Mana... You need to protect yourself. If you do something reckless, you're the one who'll regret it. Sorry. Can I see you today? We need to talk. Sorry I'm late. Waited long? Thanks for coming. Had to do overtime. Sorry to bother you. Not at all. So what's this about? I'm worried. It's complicated. Hey Makoto. Why are you so nice to me? I was envious, I guess. Of your boyfriend. You told me straight up the first time we met. That you're taken. You drew a line in the sand, and honestly, it shocked me. You didn't like me that way. So, I decided to become the kind of friend who you could tell anything to. I want you to be happy. No. It's none of my business though. No Makoto, listen... Makoto! Hey, Misaki! You didn't go home yet? I had something to do. We work together. Your girlfriend? No, unfortunately. She's not into me. No... Yeah? Sounds right! No it doesn't! Yes it does. Stop laughing. Let's walk together. Sorry, I can't... I'm fine, so go ahead. But you wanted to talk... It's okay now. I'll be in touch. Mana? Bye bye. It's hard to find an honest girl. I'm glad you're not the kind of girl who lies. Makoto? You okay? Mana, you need to protect yourself. I want you to be happy. No... I... I... Makoto! Misaki! Hey there! What? Want a date? No! Hey, do you know? Last Saturday this month. It's Yui's birthday. I'll go to the party. She'd love that. She doesn't show it, but she likes you. She likes me? She has all your songs. She never told me. She never told me till recently. Off the record, okay? Okay, let's do it. Gotcha. Over to you. What were you talking about? He said he was nervous, so I helped him relax. With the mic off? Sounds fishy. Don't be stupid. Kitani, you should find a new job as a gossip show assistant. Sorry I'm a bigmouth! Don't say sorry, just don't say anything. Okay. Now it's time to begin week six. It's a letter from Fukamizu in Odawara. Its title: "summer pickles." "summer pickles." Screw you, bike! Screw you, fields! Screw you, countryside! Fuka? You're Fuka, right? Long time no see! Remember me? Kaname. I'm Kaname! Well, you were little then. Good to see you! This is heavy. Take it for me? Mom went back to Tokyo to work over summer. My cousin suddenly turned up, saying she put him in charge, and he'd be here all summer. I hadn't seen him in years. So basically, for the summer, I had to live with a cousin I barely knew. Fuka, breakfast is ready. Let's eat. I keep to myself, so that others do too. I decided that when I came here. It's my barrier. Some boorish people ignore it. Sometimes people trample on it, thinking they're doing a good thing. I hate people like that more than anything. "No breakfast for me." Stop doing this. Stop interfering! Fuka, breakfast is... This is wrong. Fuka! Fuka! Fuka! Let's go home. Hey... What? Do you smell like pickles? You don't. Let go. Okay, let's go! Let go! Stop it! Let go! Let go! Let's eat. Oh, got it. Gently, gently. That's the way. No no no! Stop it! I can't drink it. Careful! Stop it! There we go! That's dangerous! Cool, huh? This is fun. Stop that! Nothing. Well? It's good. Kaname! Kaname... I smell of pickles, right? Do I stink? See you. Kaname! Kaname... See you. See you! I stink! This letter is from Misato in Kawasaki. Its title: "Gift of Christmas Eve." And lifetime care too. Sure. Hello? I'll be right there. Mrs. Makita in 203. Another complaint? Misato, would you mind going? Sure. Thank you. "Gift of Christmas Eve." Come in. Mrs. Makita, you called? I'm sorry. My hand slipped. Weren't you fond of this cup? You bought it in France. I requested no sugar in my coffee. It won't happen again. I hate that nurse, so please assign someone else. It's the third time. We don't have that many staff. She seems quite difficult. She taught French literature, and she grew up rich. Fussiness and pride don't wane, but bodies do. Does she have family? She does. Quite a while back, her nephew came, but when he heard she donated her assets, he never returned. Er, excuse me. Where can I find facility director Kojima? Around the corner, on the left. Thank you very much. The pairing of a young trainee nurse with the most difficult resident, Shizuka Makita, had totally unexpected consequences... Ms. Makita's changed since Yoshinari came. She hadn't walked in the garden once in 12 months. Better return to your room. You'll catch cold here. Mr. Shimada, it's late. Get some sleep. Wait till tomorrow. Yes, wait till tomorrow. Mr. Shimada, you want to go home? Yoshinari was amazing. I'll go with you. Mr. Shimada used to cause trouble because he wanted to go home, but with Yoshinari, he became more reasonable. There are girls everywhere. Africa... Africa? Take me there then! What surprised me more... ...was that the difficult Ms. Makita opened up to him. It's your first Christmas here. Hey, can you play an instrument or sing? I learned piano a long time ago. On Christmas Eve, we hold a mini-concert. We need another member. Please help us! Wow Yoshinari, you can speak French. You were talking with Ms. Makita. Oh... that? Ms. Makita's the real deal, but I only know a few phrases. So you studied, didn't you? You're amazing. You're in tune with other people's feelings. I... don't deserve a compliment like that. You know, from a young age, I was raised in an orphanage. I've never seen my parents. Everyone else had... The words that he suddenly spoke then moved me deeply. But since coming here, I've finally found a family... I realized that he was driven by a loneliness far deeper than my own. That's all for now. By the way, has there been any change with Ms. Makita? Not really... You're in charge of her now. You're doing us a big favor. Actually, she gave me a note saying she wants us to buy her some things. "Socks, hand cream, sanitary items" When the strong-willed Mrs. Makita developed Alzheimers, it came as a shock. Please tell me. What did Ms. Makita ask Ms. Mikami to buy? I can't say. Why can't you? I just can't. Yoshinari became quite agitated, and I felt as if his agitation was agitating me. Why not? I want to help Ms. Makita. Please. My heart was aflutter. Please. Tell me! Please. Ms. Takashima! I... talked to the facility director. My teacher at the orphanage has passed away. I want to go to the funeral. I'll be back by tomorrow night, so please take care of Shizuka. They're here. They're pretty. I can't wait. Neither can I. Ms. Mikami, Ms. Makita's not here. She said she's not well enough to come. Is she ill? She said she'll tell Yoshinari. She won't tell me. Didn't he say he'd be back today? I'll be right back. Ms. Makita? The concert's starting. Why don't you join us? Stay away. Please, don't come near me. "Trains stopped. Back by morning." Shizuka... Shizuka was 15 again. She returned to the age of 15, and fell in love with Yoshinari. Maybe he was her first love. Her first, pure-hearted love. The crane that Shizuka lovingly made was covered in her writing. It was a fiery, intense, passionate love letter. "You are more precious to me than life." It hurt him deeply. A little while after that, Yoshinari quit his job to study medical care overseas. Before he left this nursing home, I wanted to tell him how I felt. I tried to write a letter, but I couldn't give it to him. I guess... ...that's because Shizuka's love letter was so sad, and so beautiful... Our mail address is Join me again next week, at the same time. You've been listening to Toru Misaki. Good night. Okay! Good job. Good job. Good job, Misaki. Good job. No. Don't be silly! Come on. Good job. Good job. Good job! That's so good! People love this series. It's a hit. I like it. Huh? What's going on? Yui, congratulations! Thank you! Congrats. Thank you, Misaki! "Want to grab a bite?" Shuichi! Sorry I'm late! Sorry. Where to? It's a secret. Oh come on! Any requests? Um, Chinese? OK! No problem.
