Nikkatsu Presents This is a fictional account using real names and places. Regardless of the authenticity, the stories are not true. - What the hell are you doing? Be careful! - Shut up! - Eh? Stop teasing! Show me! What takes so long?! That's better! This is a special deal for you. Why didn't you show 'it'? You can't become popular otherwise. Exposing it makes them happy. - Are you talking about my privates? - Of course. When I feel like doing it... I'll do it, but I don't want you bossing me around. You don't know how to talk to us. If you asked me nicely, I'd show more. There's nothing for you to lose by showing it. Hey, you better watch your mouth. I'm not kidding. Listen, girls, this theater is worth nothing. Why don't we wrap up and leave? Coming? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. Who do you think you are? Ugly bitch! How about your contract? You can't break it. Just try. Hear me? You won't be able to dance anywhere professionally. - Don't be afraid of him, girls. Let's go. - All right! THAT'S HOW IT USED TO BE Sometimes you have to gamble. We came all this way by simply exposing ourselves. Literally, from the poorest of roots... to our current position of success and trust. We must keep going strong.

Thank you very much, thank you very much! I'm leaving Kamagasaki ghetto! WET LUST: 21 STRIPPERS My luck's turned around since I found that wallet. Turned around? So what business are you in? It's something like being a pimp. Being a pimp isn't something to be proud of. You're tough! Anyway, I'm in a better position today. How many girls do you have? - Five. - You're talking big! I just started... but, listen... I can already smell which kind of girl is an easy target. - How? - By her contours. Contours? Maybe an amateur like you can't understand. I'm leaving. - Are you on the road... all over Japan? - Right. - Then maybe we'll see each other again. - Right. - Bye. - He's a pimp! - Toba, let's go. See you later. The guy who was eating with you warned me that you're a pimp. That guy loves to joke around. - So, do you have money? - Why? How much do you have? - Are you a prostitute? - I'm not such a big deal. What do you mean by that? You're funny. I don't mind sex, if you have money. - Not much. - Alright. The money first. I need money before sex, or guys ask for a discount later. They always say, "You enjoyed it too," and I always feel bad, because they're right. - Sounds logical to me. Here. - Thanks. Let's doit. - What's your occupation? - Sorta like a pimp. - So you really are a pimp? - Can't you tell? Why don't we work together? So you really are a pimp? Can you just stop calling me a pimp? Let's go on the road together. It'd be fun. It might seem rushed, but I must leave this town today. - You're tactless! Don't talk while we're having sex. - OK. I'm going to Aomori. I'm not asking you to leave here forever. Just consider a week or two, like a vacation with me. Don't talk to me. That's it... You know what feels good. Feels so good! Right... we're good together! - That's it... - Don't talk to me. I think I'm falling in love with you. Let me off... please, let me off! That son of a bitch! With another woman! Come back! Wait! Stop! Bastard! Yuko! Yuko! It's me! Yuko! Hey, let's get going. We must keep moving. I'm waiting for you, Yuko! Here you go. Is this what you want? Blond hair imported from abroad. I got your pubic hair, Yuko. Thank you! Hey... are you feeling good? You can make a noise if you want. Come on... Let me do it. I want to do it good... Where's your hand? - Here are her breasts... You can squeeze. - Thank you. Your left hand's supposed to be down there. I'm not using my left hand. Stupid... touch her! All right, I'll do it. Are you doing your job? Don't worry about me... Go ahead and fuck her. I'm doing it... - Hey! - Be quiet! I've liked you for a long time. - No! - Please... - Stop it! Please listen to me. Give me a chance! No! Forget about him... He ran away with another woman. - So, please... - Stop! - You don't have to be loyal to a creep like him. - Stop! What are you doing? Stupid! Are you trying to seduce my man because you lost yours? Bitch! Sister, that's a terrible thing for you to say! Don't act all innocent... I saw you two doing it! Bitch! Sister, I didn't do anything! You're such a liar. You tried to steal my husband! - No way! He came on to me! - Shut up! Excuse me... Because of my mad behaviour... you lost your prized dancer. I apologise sincerely. Indeed, you are insolent. Madam, I don't know how to make amends. You helped me financially, and I betrayed you. I don't think this will cancel my wrongful deeds... but as a man, I must do it. - Hey, wait! What are you doing?! - Stop! - Where are you going? - I must go! - Husband! Listen to me, the madam of Asakasu-Rokku was a stripper, showing her privates. She saved a lot of money up. And now she has four or five theaters all over Japan. You've heard of Asakasu-Rokku? That theater chain... has a history going back 40 years. She became boss 10 years after she started stripping. Think hard about this... Is there any other job where a woman can make big money... just by showing her privates? Then... 10 years later, you could have a million dollars. It's up to you. I'm merely giving you an opportunity... Now... let's try this again. Listen... If you worked in a bathhouse, you'd be naked all day long. You could easily harm your health. A prostitute? Your pussy would be ruined and you'd go crazy. But a stripper... all she does is show her privates, without any harm. With pride! The more pride you have, the more enthusiastic the audience. Is there any other business as good? Shut up! You're ruining my concentration. Are you OK? Oh... darling! How'd you know I was here? Please come back. Since you left, I've had bad luck. - Kyu seduced me. - What? What did Kyu do? I'm so pissed off! Damn! No matter who I choose... one of you will get hurt. So why don't you talk to each other and decide for me. I wouldn't complain. I'd respect your decision. - You're fooling yourself. - Is there a better way? Why don't you girls decide? I'll do whatever you say. Or maybe the three of us could stay together. I wouldn't mind. You two could put on a lesbian show. It would be worth more money. - Why don't you leave? - What was that? I think we girls could do well together... without you. You have us good advice. I'd like to try it with her. But we don't need you. I see. Tonight is the last night. You may stay with us tonight. You bitch! I can't accept such an outrageous ideal You can't control me. Hey, you're the one who told us you'd respect our decision. Maybe I did, but asking me to leave is not an option. I won't accept that! You bitches! I don't hold any personal grudge but I must take your life. The is the solemn obligation of the yakuza world. Boss, I will take your life! Sir, we have a casualty. A man is dead. I need salt to purify the area. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Come here for a little bit. - What are you saying? Just for a bit. I want a family with you. - I promise to make you happy. - Whatever, just do it quickly. Hiromi! It's time! Quickly! AND TIME HAS PASSED The train will be delayed 50 minutes due to mechanical problems... Yukari, we have an hour to kill. Let's practise. - Everybody, get up. - Yes, madam. You become the lead. Take off your overcoat. Okay, get in line. Sister, I can't do this. I can't do it anymore. I must quit. My body can't take it. Take a look... can you see it? I still have the blond hair you gave me last time. Thank you, pervert! I can't take this anymore. I'll be dead. I can't control myself. Four times a day... then days in a row. I can't handle so many orgasms. Let me quit this crazy job. Aren't you stupid, to react so personally? Just act - pretend. I'm too sensitive. I try... but I can't pretend. Don't take pride in such behaviour. Can we quit the lesbian show? Can't do that! We have a contract. I'm not talking to you. Sister, please, do something for me. Perhaps I could do it without using the dildo. - Then how would you do it? - With just my fingers. Your fingers? Well, I easily fall in love. I wouldn't know what to do if I became a genuine... A genuine what? A genuine lesbian. Then I'd want to become involved with you. Stupid! Don't talk crap. This is our business. Shut up! I like you, sister. So I wonder if I should quit. I understand what you're saying, but we do have a contract. We still have a week left. Maybe we should reverse roles, eh? Then you'd feel better, right? - Are you mad at me? - No way. I've been holding my pee. - Hey! - What?! What do you want? - Let me fuck youl! - Of course not! We decided to dump you, but you won't leave. Why are you still here? This time I realised how much I love you. So, please... Leave me alone! Believe me this time. I'm really in love with you, eh? - Really? - Yes, really. Do you regret what you've done? - Of course. - Oh? - So let's fuck! I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you, Yuko. You don't have to worry anymore. I won't leave you. - I... I've been feeling lonely. - Really? Not anymore. Feel good, Yuko? See...? I can't hold my piss any longer! Don't worry, just let it leak out. Let it go. Yuko, Yuko! You're great! I must... I must... go! Sister! Sister! Sister...! Good job, ex-guitar man. - Are you ready? - Yes. - Soup's done. - OK. - I'm taking the pot. - OK. Soup's coming. Here it is. - Give me the bowls. - Here. - It's been a long time. - Right. - It's been a long time, Boss. How've you been since you ran away from Madam's? I still owe the Madam... this is hard for me to say... But I joined a yakuza clan. There's something I must do. - Eh? You became a yakzuza? - Sort of. The reason I'm here today is to ask for another favour. My yakuza brother is in trouble... faraway. - My car broke down... - Husband? I need to borrow one of your cars, so I can help him. Please, will you help me out? What are you saying? You have quite a nerve... asking more favours, after everything you've done. Husband, forget about the yakuza. Think about your family. I'll be back to get you. Boss, please help me. Can I borrow a car? No way. How can I trust you? I understand my faults. Despite that... I beg you. I beg you! Stupid! Life isn't so easy. I said no. I'm begging you... Quit the yakuza and return to Mayu. - l understand, I'll be back. - Husband! What is this? You're acting goofy. Are you really a yakuza? Husband! Thanks for coming tonight. Take a good look! One more beer. I discovered something about women... A tough woman is more loyal to her man. She works hard to make a man happy, without being promiscuous. On the other hand, a sweet woman cannot be trusted. She can fall in love with anybody, anytime. She's sweet to me, but at the same time... She's sweet to other guys, too. Choose a tough woman. Do you remember when we met before? At the noodle place down by the harbour? Is that your child? No way. A pimp wouldn't impregnate a woman. How did it go with that girl? It went well, even though you tried to interfere. How about that one? Madam, take care of this kid. - How far are you going? - Shut up. You need patience. I see. But what if she goes into her house? Then you can't do anything. Then at least I'll know her address. That's good, too. Are you coming because you want to interfere again? You're concerned about her going home, but I can tell... she's not local. She's wondering where she's going. Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bunmei Tobayami. I'm part of the Misfit Theatre... a travelling theatre. I have something to say. A pimp is following you, and you're his target. I'm not lying to you, but it's good for you to run away like this. Let me join you... we'll run together. Don't be a victim of a nasty pimp. - Are you talking about yourself? - No, I'm not. Of course not. But the priority is running away from him now. Running is good. Policeman! Help me! - Hey, what're you doing? - I'm innocent! - Come with us. I come from Shinshu. Shunshu is too broad... I'm actually from Kiso... Ah, Yuko... Thank you very much for listening to me! I wonder where she's going. I don't really care. I'll keep following her forever, maybe to southern Kyushu, or maybe to Okinawa. What are you doing? Stop it. Don't hurt me. I don't want to get hurt, so I'm doing this. I don't believe you. Quick... Quick response. - You're very sensitive. - Really? I fell in love with you when I first saw you. You looked cool whilst walking. Nice skin... A young girl is the best. Very firm. I can't stand it... It's good. Let me come, too. Compared with you, other girls are crap. Why don't you join me in my travels for a couple of days? I'm heading to Kyoto. Well, do you want to come with me? Are you coming? I came! Was it good? - I want to change my clothes. Will you wait outside? - Yes. Quiet! That bitch! She said it was good... but she actually reported me to the police. You can't trust a woman. But she had a fine body. Woman... I forgot her name... I picked her up like a rock... and dumped her like a stone. All the girls I pick up, and then I drop. 100 women crying... 100 women will laugh when I die. Women... Who can understand them? Women... the mystery of life... - Does this mean...? - No way. - Is it his? - His? Are you also...? Are you pregnant? Of course not! I'm just too emotional. That bastard! - What are you two doing up there? - Shut up! Are you trying to pick a fight? Then come down here! Listen to me: the Madam of Asakasu-Rokkul... saved a tremendous amount of money, just by showing her body. You know Asakasu-Rokku... 40 years of history... She started as a stripper, now she owns four or five theatres, theatres all over Japan. She bought them after stripping for 10 years. Think about the jobs a woman can do... to make that kind of money. Just by showing her privates, she can make a million dollars... in just 10 years. You have possibilities... do you understand me? Madam, Madam, wake up. You are... It's been a long time. Are you here to borrow more money? Kyu, speak to me. I owe you a lot of money... I don't deserve to say this to you, please close your eyes. Are you going to kill me? Is this a joke? - It's no joke. - Why is that? You turned down my request for a car, and I lost my pride. Let's talk about it...! What's going on in here? Police! Police! AND NOW... English translation: Subtitles ripped & retimed Yuko Mihara & Thomas Weisser by lordretsudo THE END
