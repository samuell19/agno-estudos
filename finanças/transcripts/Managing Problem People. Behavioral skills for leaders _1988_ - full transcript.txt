[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm under enormous pressure, Doctor. I mean, I'm not working well. I just don't know what to do. Calm yourself, Mr. Jackson, and explain it all to me. Well, it's Reggie, in stores. He's driving everybody mad, and they're all blaming me because he's my responsibility. - I see. - I mean, take the other day. One of our young salesmen, Barry, had a client drop in on him unexpectedly. - Barry, Barry. - Spot on, man. - Nice to see you. - How are you? Sorry to drop in out of the blue like this. No, not at all. I happened to be in the area and thought I'd like have a look at those new fluorescent strips of yours. What, the AP 700? It's-- you got the literature I sent you, then? That's right. You know, it really is a breakthrough, the AP 700. You can save up to 700 kilowatt hours a year on one unit alone. So I understand. Listen, would you like to see one? Well, I would like to miss the traffic, if it's possible. No problem, no problem, hang on a tick. I'll just go to stores. It won't be a second. - Hello, Reggie. - Hello, there, young man. What can I do you for then? Well, I've got a big client waiting outside. He needs to see an AP 700 straight away. And, uh, I'm fresh out of samples, just one? Certainly, my friend, uh, you've got the IOF 7? Ah, well, you see, the land line to Birmingham's down. And I thought, you know, as it's urgent, just this once-- Sorry, chummy. You know the rules. No paperwork, no can do. Got to have the docket. Oh, well, I can get you the order form tomorrow, this afternoon probably. It is urgent. You reps are all the same, aren't you? You think you can ride roughshod over the system. I mean, look. What would happen if I let everyone just walk off with my stock? Bloody anarchy. Well, I'm not just everyone, and I'm not walking off with it. It's a sample for a client. I mean, for goodness sake, I'll bring it back when he's seen it. This isn't a lending library, right? Please, Reggie? Look, young Barry, you see what it says above that door, the store room manager? Look. I spent more years of my life getting to that position than you spent on this planet. Now you think I'm going to risk that and do some favor for a young rep who can't be bothered to do things properly? Come on. Well, I'm just going to have to go and see Mr. Jackson then, aren't I? Well, you do as you like, young Barry. Mr. Jackson will tell you I'm only doing my job. [PHONE RINGING] [INAUDIBLE] All right, all right, I'm coming. We haven't got secretaries down here, you know. Hello, stock room. Oh, it's you again, is it? Look, don't talk to me like that, sonny. You know the rules. If you want to change them, go and talk to the managing director. God. Uh, hello there, Reggie. Oh, hello, Mr. Jackson. Young Barry come running to you, has he then? Now then, Reggie, what's all this about. Well, you know as well as I do, Mr. J, rules is rules. And if a rep wants a sample, he has to have an IOF form. Can't we stretch the point, Reggie? Well, you're the boss, Mr. Jackson, but it seems to me there's no point in having a system if you're going to break it every 10 minutes. This is a special case. [LAUGHTER] Oh, they're all special cases, Mr. J, oh, dear. But can't you do it as a favor to me? I'll buy you a drink tomorrow at lunch time. Well, you'll have to sign for it personally. I'm not taking responsibility. - All right. - All right. Look, do you think we could leave the paperwork till later? I mean, my client will be eating the car park by now. Do the paperwork later? Have you run stark, staring mad? Just this once, Reggie? Anarchy, that's what it is, bloody anarchy. There you are, young whippersnapper. Thanks, Reggie, I owe you one. Now then, Mr. J, as it's a special case, I will be needing a transfer docket, a requisition slip, and an internal order form. Mad, he's driving me mad. Heaven alone knows how much time I waste chasing after that infernal man and his rules. Fascinating, that is fascinating. Well, can't you do something, Dr. Mendel? Yes, quite certainly, there's no difficulty there. Really? Of course not, the solution is in your hands. What, a broken pencil? No, I mean, figuratively in your hands. You see, each time you go down on bended knee to Reggie, each time you pander to his self-importance, you encourage it. The more you bend, the more he puts up a show of resistance. Yeah, but that's all very well, but, I mean, how else can I get what I want? - You are his boss, you know? - Yes. Then act like it. Stop playing his game. Make him play yours. Don't offer to buy him drinks. That is reinforcing his behavior pattern. I don't know anything about behavior patterns. But, I mean, are you saying it's my fault that he's a rule-bound, Bolshie son of a weasel? Not your fault, no, no, but you can stop it. Next time, just give him a direct order, and be as cold and as commanding as you can be. A direct order? Like? Like, just do it, Reggie. Just do it, Reggie. May I say, please? Well, you could certainly say, do it, and do it now, please, Reggie. Do it, and do it now, please, Reggie. Be as cold and commanding as you can be. All right, I'll give it a try. Don't talk to me like that, sonny. Those are the rules. If you want to change them, go and talk to the managing director. Can I have a word, Reggie? Ah, so little Barry came running to you, did he, then, Mr. Jackson? Now then, Reggie, why wouldn't you give Mr. Chase his sample. Now you know as well as I do, Mr. Jackson, rules is rules. Well, do it now, please, Reggie. Oh, but I can't go handing-- Just do it, and do it now, please, Reggie. If you want me to sign for it, send the relevant documents up to my office. I'm busy. You're busy, and Barry's busy. So let's just get on with it, shall we? There you are. That worked, didn't it? Well, he did it. Well, what else do you want? Well, he was very pleased about it, was he? Well, now, of course not, that's the first step. There will be resentment. He used to feel important because he controlled you, and now his self-esteem is lowered. That is never good. Now the next step is to raise it, but this time in the right way-- encouragement, uh, reward, a feeling of belonging to the company. Do you include him in weekly departmental meetings, for instance? - No. - Well, that's worth thinking about. Make him feel a part of things. Yes. Yes, I think I know what you mean. Hello, Reggie. Uh, you know those parts I asked to be dispatched to, uh, Carlisle? Well, what about them? I did them as quick as I could. Yes, I know. I-- I just came in to thank you. I can't believe how fast you managed it all. Oh. I've just had Carlisle on the phone. They're delighted. They've had a trade fair on up there, and they'd run out of working stock. Between you and me, I don't think they've got a very efficient setup up here. No, no, well, it was a bit of an effort, actually, but-- Well, I can't think how you did it all. Oh, by the way, I've been meaning to say this to you for some time. We normally have the department's weekly meetings in my office on Tuesday mornings. I think it would be a good idea if you sat in on those. The weekly meeting? I think your presence would be invaluable. Oh, well, I think I can spare the, uh-- yeah, why not? Of course. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Jackson. - Ah, Reggie. - Hello, young man. Don't tell me the land line's down again? Well, now, don't blame me. It's not my fault the land line's down, Reggie. - Oh, dear, what do you want then? - EZ 89. One EZ 89 coming up. [INAUDIBLE] paperwork [INAUDIBLE] Just a bit of management, Barry, that's all it takes. No one's all bad, you know. Congratulations, you have corrected the relationship. I told you it was simple. Well, I can't thank you enough, Dr. Mendel. My usual fee is 250 pounds. That should go some way towards thanking me. Yes, well, if you'd like to send your invoice to accounts, they will, uh, process it, provided that it is accompanied by a J 306. Then, of course, you'll need to send a copy to finance, together with the D 19, and-- 250 pounds. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, excuse me. - Cash? - Please. [MUSIC PLAYING] The rules for dealing with Reggie are the rules for dealing with everyone. But with Reggie, they're especially important. Don't play his game. Make him play yours. Now you know as well as I do, Mr. Jackson, rules is rules. Well, do it now, please, Reggie. Make him part of the whole operation. We normally have the department's weekly meetings in my office on Tuesday mornings. I think it would be a good idea if you sat in on those. The weekly meeting? Congratulate him when he behaves the way you want. I just came in to thank you. I can't believe how fast you managed it all. [MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, Jean, get me Mr. Wooster on line 3, will you? Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm talking to Simon at the moment, thanks. Uh, now, look, Simon, give me a rundown on January's commissions, will you, as soon as possible, yesterday by choice? Yeah, fax your secretary over. I mean, get your secretary to bike over a fax, OK. Uh, see nothing in your letter that justifies the establishment of a full, uh, network. Yes, Simon? OK, right, let me know if you can get that rep to Huddersfield tomorrow morning, will you? Pronto, cheers. Jean, have you got Mr. Wooster on line 3 yet? Fine. Hello, uh, Bertie, Stewart here, listen. Uh, that man of yours, what was his name? You said he was the most resourceful valet you'd ever heard? Jeeves, that was it. Well, now, could you lend him to me? I mean, if he's as good as you say-- [THROAT CLEARING] --I'd really-- come in-- appreciate that. Good morning, sir. Mr. Wooster sent me. - You were quick. - I endeavor to give satisfaction, sir. Well, um, thank you, Bertie. So you're, uh, you're Jeeves, are you? Yes. If you will allow me, sir, I think this will meet your requirements. What? The confection you are favoring at the moment, sir, is perhaps a trifle noisy for an open-plan office. Look, Jeeves, didn't send for you to talk about ties. I want advice. I do beg your pardon, sir. I was the victim of, uh, confusion as to my function here. - You what? - I was laboring under a delusion, sir. I fancied that Mr. Wooster sent me to counsel you as to your habiliments. - Ah, do you speak English, Jeeves? - Whenever it is convenient, sir. Well, look. It's convenient now because I've got a problem, and it has nothing do with my clothes, either. I like this tie. Anyway, the CEO gave it to me. Possibly, he was desirous of getting of it, sir. What? Well, look. This is the problem, right? I've got an area sales manager under me called Billy Sargent, and the fact is, well, he's a real big mouth. He promises, but he never delivers. - Most distressing, sir. - Yes, it is distressing, Jeeves. Look. Look. I'll-- I'll-- I'll show you, too. Um, hello. Uh, Jean? I thought I asked you to get Billy over here. Well, send him in, will you? He's coming. Ah, Billy, uh, do sit down. Now a bit of admin, I need your department's expenses for this quarter. They'll be on your desk first thing after lunch. Good, now, uh, what about that new account in your area, Halbach and Kennedy? I thought I asked you to send someone out. I was just about to do that very thing, Stew, when you called me in. Yes, but I asked you a month ago. Yeah, well, uh, I'm tied up with a bit of a shortfall of manpower in the field at the moment. But you said that you'd put someone straight onto it. Yeah, well, uh, I had to judge for the right moment. I mean, you pressurize these new companies, and they'll distrust you. Hmm, well, forget it, Billy. I just had word they gave Parker and Gibbs the big order, all right? We missed the bus, Billy. I mean, that was why it was so urgent. Oh, yeah, well, these new companies, I shouldn't be surprised if they'll be bust within a week or two, defaulting on payments here and there. It sounded like a bit of a Mickey-Mouse operation to me. I reckon we're well out of it. Uh-huh, well, uh, anyway, what about this call-rate problem? Look, I want a monthly report on salespeople who fail to make calls. Your area is one of the worst, Billy. - One of the best? - What? We're the worst because we're the best. We're such a hot, tight little area, Stew, that, uh, we simply have more calls to make, which means more calls that we fail to make. Well, anyway, I want-- I want that report out by yesterday. On your desk first thing. - It better be. And, uh, Industrial Carpet Storage wanted a call. They're thinking of upgrading to Turbonet 7. I will call on them myself personally. Yeah, you-- you're not taking on too much? I mean, you're not biting off more than you can chew? Hey, Stewart, I'm famous for my bite. I can chew with the best of them. I'll handle it myself, personally. Oh, by the way, uh, I volunteered to organize a Christmas party this year. I was wondering if you had any ideas about the venue. No, no, um, no, I'll leave that to you. But-- but-- but do the other things first, will you, Billy? Consider it done, Stew. Ciao. Hasta la vista. There, and you can guarantee he'll only get 25% of those done, if we're lucky. That reminds me. You ask him to do something, and he's so sure. And then he just doesn't do it. Oh, hello. Uh, Donna, Stewart here. Billy's just left my office. I forgot to ask him to chase up the Pride account, OK? Oh, and, um, if he's going to the garage, could he get them to fix the telephone antenna on my Jag? Thanks. Well, I don't suppose he'll manage those two, either. [CLEARING THROAT] May I ask, sir, is Mr. Sargent otherwise an admirable employee? Billy? Oh, one of the best. We used to say he could sell shampoo to Kojak, if he ever got around to making the call. Exquisitely droll, sir-- it seems to me, however, sir, that you are something of a forceful gentleman. Well, is there anything wrong with that? No, indeed, sir, I have often remarked it is a most important attribute for any manager. Um, however, I wonder if you've made it quite clear to Mr. Sargent that he is able to discuss your requests. Well, you're not saying he's afraid of me? Not afraid, precisely, sir, no, but you are quite a dynamo, however, and give orders with some alacrity. Speak English, Jeeves. Very good, sir, I have often expressed the opinion that the most important part of management is not telling someone to do something, but making sure that he or she is able to do it. Anyone can give orders. You mean, you have to know if the orders are feasible or not? Precisely, sir. What-- you're not saying it's my fault? Oh, no, sir, but it is your problem, and it is for you to solve. That is why you are a manager. So I'm simply giving him too much to do? That is partly it, sir. I'm not suggesting that you treat him like a child. Merely as a term, shall we say, limit his actions? Encourage him to be honest and realistic. Shall we start again, sir? - What do you mean? - Uh, rewind, sir. [REWINDING] That's clever. Uh, hello, Jean, I thought I asked you to get Billy over? He is? Oh, well, send him in, please. He's coming. He's coming. Ah, Billy, do, uh, do sit down. Now, look. Um, I need your department's expenses for this quarter. They'll be on your desk first thing in the morning. - Are you sure? - No problem. - Well, it's quite a lot to do, you know. - Hey, I can handle it. Yes, but you don't think that a couple of days would be a more realistic deadline? That's fine by me. You're right, a couple of days. Uh-huh, I mean, you should just say if there's too much on your plate, you know? Hey, Stewart, don't talk to me about plates. [BEEPING] Is he all right? Oh, yes, sir, just on pause for the moment-- now, sir, you've shown him he can be more honest and more realistic with deadlines. That's excellent. However, sir, I feel you made a slight mistake in not telling him why you want your department's expenses. If he knows your reasons, he'll feel a part of things. That gives him an incentive. Well, we've got a budget meeting with finance on Tuesday week. Well, then, you'll forgive me for saying so, sir. You have no need of your information until Friday at the earliest. Tell him so. [BEEPING] Ah, Billy, um, I've got a budget meeting with finance on Tuesday week. So I'll need your department's expense sheets for this quarter. Tuesday week? Well, I'll have them on your desk by, uh, day after tomorrow then. Day after tomorrow, can you-- could you really have them done by then? - Oh, really, done? - Uh-huh. Oh, well, I can really have them done by Friday. Friday, Friday will be fine. [BEEPING] - What? - Well, if you'll excuse me, sir, I have often thought that it's not just as firm a deadline as possible, but also witnesses are very helpful. Ah, I think I see what you mean. Uh, unfreeze him, would you? In fact, Friday is very, very cool for me, indeed. What? Oh, uh, right, um, uh, Jean, uh, Billy is preparing his expenses on Friday. Can you have someone pick him up from his office at, uh, what time exactly, Billy? - Uh, 3 o'clock. - 3 o'clock? Thanks. That gives me a chance to take it home and read it at the weekend. Now what about that new account in your area, Halbach and Kennedy? I asked you to send somebody out. I was just about to do that very thing, Stew, when you called me in. Yeah, but I asked you a month ago. Yeah, well, we're tied up with a bit of a shortfall of manpower in the field at the moment. I, uh, I wanted to wait for exactly the right moment to pitch, you know? You pressurize these new companies, and [WHOOSH] they'll distrust you. Well, forget it. I've just had word they're giving the big contract to Parker and Gibbs. We missed the bus, Billy. That was why it was so urgent. But it was my fault because I should have explained that. I had an idea Parker and Gibbs were pitching. I'm sure if I had told you that, you would have done it. I'm sorry, Stew. No, no, no, I'm sorry. That sort of thing? Perfect, sir, perfect. Ah, anyway, now, um, now what about this call-rate problem? I want a monthly report on salespeople who fail to make calls. Your area is one of the worst, Billy. - One of the best. - What? We are such a hot, tight, little area Stew, that, uh, we simply have more calls to make, which means more calls we fail to make. Look, Tony's area makes more calls than you do and has a lower failure rate. Uh, yeah, Tony's area, but, I mean, Tony-- So when am I going to get that report? Well, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Uh, how about Wednesday we-- [BEEPING] If I might suggest, sir, interim meeting is often extremely useful to discuss how far he might have gone. Ah, right. [BEEPING] --eek? Uh, no, that's too soon to get a serious report out. But I'll tell you what. Let's meet Wednesday at, say, 4 o'clock and see how far you've got? - Wednesday, 4 o'clock. - OK, shove that in your diary. If you're anything like me, you'll forget otherwise. Hello, Jean, uh, something for my diary, I'm meeting Billy 4 o'clock next Wednesday to discuss his progress on the failed calls report. Good, tha-- oh, and, uh, Jean, perhaps you'd like to sit in and take minutes of the meeting? A master stroke, sir, a veritable master stroke. Thank you. Now the other thing is industrial carbo fluids. They want a call. They're thinking of upgrading to Turbonet 7. Well, I'll, uh, I'll call on them myself, personally. No, no, I want you to recommend someone that we can send from your area office. Oh, well, Gordon Marsh is pretty good. He set up the account himself. Good, make a note to tell him. Oh, right. Excellent, and, uh, that's everything, eh? Right, oh, by the way, Stewart, I, uh, I volunteered to organize a Christmas party this year. I wondered if you had any ideas about the venue? Oh, Billy, it's heroic of you to volunteer, but you're just too valuable to us at the moment. I don't think the company can afford to lose your time. So delegate it to somebody else, will you? Oh, right. [BEEPING] If I might suggest, sir, now might be an appropriate moment to employ a rather efficacious psychological ploy. Jeeves, you're a devil. [BEEPING] Oh, and, Billy, um, when you delegate the party, make sure you do it to somebody good, huh? I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a lot of big mouths around here. Oh, don't-- the bane of my life. They promise, and then they don't deliver. You know the kind? - Do I? So before you delegate it, make sure you think they can handle it, right? They need smart handling, the big mouths of this world. - All noise, and no action. - Right, yeah. Oh, and, uh, what about the Pride account? It needs chasing up. Sure, I'll get right-- no, uh, no. Listen. Um, Stewart, I've got rather a lot on my plate at the moment. Why don't you give it to, Roger? I mean, he used to work at Pride's. Good idea, Billy. Um, one other thing, the telephone antennae on my Jaguar. Yeah? I want you to forget that you've ever heard about it. [SPLATTING] Buh-bye, Billy. I'll see you, um, when was it? Wednesday, 4 o'clock, ciao. Well, I can hardly believe it. Congratulations, sir. You've increased his confidence and let him see that he can be more honest about his workload. You've discovered that he's more likely to cooperate if he knows the reasons behind the tasks you set him and shown that by structuring meetings and enforcing realistic deadlines you can create a much more practical manner of working. Jeeves, I don't know what to say. You stand alone. Give me that tie. Sir, I-- thank you very much, indeed, sir. If I may say so, I am convinced that you will find its quiet elegance much more in harmony with the appointments of your office. And now, sir, if I may, I will take my leave. Jeeves, you're a marvel. I don't know how I shall manage without you. No, but you've already shown me, sir. You'll manage very well, indeed. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, that was clever, wasn't it? Manage, aw. [MUSIC PLAYING] Billy is a problem, but certain basic rules for managing anybody hold the solution. Encourage realism rather than optimism. Hey, I can handle it. Yes, but you don't think that a couple of days would be a more realistic deadline? - That's fine by me. - You're right, a couple of days. Explain the reasons behind the tasks. I've got a budget meeting with finance on Tuesday week, so I'll need your department's expense sheets for this quarter. Set deadlines with witnesses. Um, Jean, Billy is preparing his expenses on Friday. Can have someone pick him up from his office at, uh-- what time exactly, Billy? Uh, 3 o'clock. 3 o'clock, Jean? Thanks. Agree review points for longer projects. No, that's too soon to get a serious report out, but I'll tell you what. Let's meet Wednesday at, say, uh, 4 o'clock, and see how far you've got. Wednesday, 4 o'clock. [MUSIC PLAYING] John, it's not my fault. I rang the printers yesterday, and they said that some of the floor matting was wrong on some of the pages in this new system. I went on and on and on about it to them, and they only got it to me yesterday. John, I can't work like this. I know you're used to all this pressure. But before you came, at least I knew where I was. The same thing happened last month, damn it. It's not my fault. Don't blame me. Blame this desktop publishing, or whatever it is you call it. It actually takes some getting used to. I still can't get the hang of those digitater images scanning-- Digitizers, image scanners. Scanners, yes, well, whenever I put a photograph in, it comes out all fuzzy. There is a grayscale half-tone control. You know perfectly well that Michael is there help you on-- Michael's always busy and extremely impatient. Yes, all right, so when can I expect the first copies by, please? I don't know. That's what I'm telling you. I rang the printers-- sorry, the bureau. And they said their lineotron was down, or whatever it is. I don't know this whole new system-- Yes, all right, thank you, Minnie. Yes-- [MINNIE COMPLAINING] --yes, yes, yes, yes, thank you, Minnie, tremendous, so helpful, as always, just get on with it, please. Thank you. [MINNIE COMPLAINING] Oh, that woman, I could just-- oh, bother. Why-- what is the point? [HUMMING] [COUGHING] Golly, goodness sakes, oh, it's been a time. Where are we, then? Well, it's not Baghdad. That's for sure. It doesn't look much like Samarkand, either. This is the office of the senior PRO of Paxton Hydrochrome. Oh, it's an office, is it? Ah, yes, I see. Well, that would explain it, wouldn't it? Just who the hell are you, and what are you doing here? Greetings, master. I am-- oh, I should have a card here somewhere. Ah, it got burned up in the manifestation. I am the genie of the lamp, master. Your every wish is my command. This-- this is some kind of joke, isn't it? Is this-- is this Frank and one of his genie grams? No, no, master, you rubbed the lamp, didn't you? - Well, I suppose I did. - Come then, oh, eagle of the desert. Tell me of thy wishes. - Well, um, how many am I allowed? - As many as you like, master. It's leprechauns that only grant you three. Um, well, I could use another cup of coffee for a start. Another cup of coffee, oh, joy of the seven moons, no problem. Sim saladim. [POOFING] - Um, is it decaffeinated? - Decassta? Yes, never mind, I suspect you're a little bit out of touch. Now what I really want you to do is have a look at this dossier on this employee of mine. Hmm, well, she is attractive, master. You want her scrubbed and brought to your tent? I'm married. Ah, and how many wives have you, oh, magnificence? - One. - One, strange. Yes, um, can we just forget about the wives? I want you to stop this person from moaning. Pray explain, moon of my delight. Well, she sprays me with excuses and complains, but she never delivers. Well, can you not, oh, radiant sturgeon of the Caspian Sea, now lay down the needle of insinuation and pick up the club of plain statement? - I'm sorry. I don't understand. - Exactly, I don't understand. Look. I joined this company some months ago. Now one of my most important jobs is to supervise the editing of the monthly in-house magazine. You follow me? - Like a mountain lion, master. Good, now this PR person here, Minnie, is in charge of the day-to-day running of the magazine. And she used to be very efficient. - Well, so they claim. - Before you came. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, oh, silvery leopard of the sky. Yes, do you think we could stick to John? Now one of her most important jobs is commissioning, editing articles, that sort of thing. She has other PR duties, too, but I want her to concentrate particularly on the magazine. I see, oh, John. Good, when I arrived, I laid it on the line with her. I used to work for a national newspaper. And I told her I like to work fast and to a deadline, also that we were upgrading our production process to the new desktop publishing technology. How exciting for her, oh, John, Sultan of Paxton Hydrochrome. Well, quite, I laid my cards on the table. At first, it seemed fine, but then the excuses started. Excuse me, master, I'm-- [MUSIC PLAYING] --trying to conjure up the image. Minnie, I've got a copy of the chairman's editorial. Why don't we have that on page 3, instead of that, um, pool team photograph, hmm? - But page 3 is made up. - Well, then, unmake it. That's the point of this system. And I shall need a laser-printed copy of page 17 so I can check out Ron's article. - Page 17 isn't ready yet. - I asked for it yesterday. The copy came in late, and then I had to go down to stores and get some fluffy disks. Floppy disks, not fluffy. Well, whatever, anyway, they only had the big ones. And they didn't fit, so I had to go out and buy some. John, do you know what it's like buying flappy disks in the High Street at lunch time? It's absolute murder. It takes you hours to park the car. You get to the shop. It takes you half an hour to find an assistant who's free, then he's rude. Then he goes off. He gets the disks. He brings them back. They're the wrong ones. You have to queue again for half an hour. You get back to the car, and it's been towed away. Why couldn't you send someone else? Don't you think I would have done if I could have? Rebecca's been off all week with a virus actually, and Mary was collecting copy from all around the office. Yes, yes, yes, where is page 17? And there's the interdepartmental tennis match to organize. Don't forget, the interdepartmental tennis match doesn't actually run itself, I think you'll find, John. Forget the interdepartmental tennis match. You are supposed to be running a magazine. Well, you try telling that to marketing and finance. They're playing each other tomorrow. I'm going to end up having to set up a net in the car park if it-- Minnie, I want page 17! (WEEPILY) But everyone is using the laser printer at the moment, and it never used to be like this in the old days. Minnie, I don't want excuses. I want action. Now get on with it. I don't actually have 12 pairs of legs, John. - You see? - Indeed, I see, oh, frustrated one. So can you change her character so I get more action and less whinging? - No, master. - No? - No one can change her character. - What do you mean? Well, her behavior can be changed, perhaps, but not her character. Well, change her behavior, then. But only you can do that. What are you talking about? This is a good woman you have here, a-- a good employee, oh, star of the Silver Sea. Nonsense, you just heard that. I heard you, master. I have been in the lamp, remember? You come in here with a new system, which I'm sure is a fine system, lord of my life, but you give Minnie no time. You make no consultations or deadline. You shun all discussions. You treat her like a slave. Slave? You should see a newspaper office. You are not running a newspaper office. This is the world of business, where management is a skill and not a shouting match, oh, tree upon which the fruit of my life is hung. Minnie is used to one way of doing things. So if you wish her to change, you must encourage, not threaten. Assist, not terrify. Encourage with patience. Assist with realistic deadlines. Discuss practically in a clear way. You must give her time. But this is a pressure business. Time is the one thing we don't have. You must be the master of time, not its slave, oh, monstrosity of my delight. You're given no alternative but to hide behind the boulder of excuse and the thicket of complaint. Check with her. Share your thoughts with her. You are not Lou Grant. Dyspeptic slang and sour recrimination achieves no results with real people. I don't have time. You have all there is. Look, I'm a busy man. I can't waste my time chasing and mollycoddling. If she can't stand the heat, why can't she get out of the kitchen? Now I hear you moaning, and you offering reasons why you can't do your job properly, oh, whinging hyena of discontent. Your job is management of people. Right, right, a fine genie you've turned out to be. So what do I do? I shall show you how I would manage Minnie. What do you mean? Imagine that I am you and that you are me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, John. Ah, sit down, beloved pantherus of the Bosporus. Beg your pardon? Uh, Minnie, Minnie, Minnie, um, I have got the chairman's editorial here, Minnie. What do you think about putting it on page 3? Page 3 is already made up, I'm afraid. Well, well, how long would it take you to unmake it? I don't know. Uh, Kathy is out of the office all day today, and I've got to go down to stores to get some more floppy disks. Yes, well, there are some important things today, Minnie, and one of them is to get that page remade. And then we must produce a laser-printed copy of page 17 so that I can check Ron's article. Page 17, it's not ready yet, page 17. Right, well, those are the two things that we need done today. But, John, there's the departmental tennis match. Oh, uh, well, we'll get someone else to sort that out, don't you think? Who? Who's going to do it? Well, let's deal with that in a moment. Minnie, I've been thinking. This, um, present job description of yours, public relations office, it seems to encourage everyone to take up your time. I was thinking it might be better, with your approval, to call you managing editor of the magazine. Oh, I see, managing editor. Now I know I've been rushing you recently, perhaps a bit too much, but some things do have to be done quickly, like page 17. Well, I would if I could, John, seriously, but the office-- Can you have it done by this afternoon? - Or tomorrow morning? - No, that's not early enough. Um, uh, can I get you some help? No, I'm perfectly capable of doing it myself. The thing is that there is a meeting at 2 o'clock this afternoon about secretary allocation and I really have to be there. Well, look. I'll call Don and tell him that you can't make it. Would that help? I need to know what they decide because if I know Don, he will automatically-- I'll-- I'll tell Don to send you the minutes, and you can read them. And if anything special comes up, they can give you a ring. But we must get that page out, hmm? Now is there anything else you've got to do? Um, no, no, no. All right, well, let's say, uh, 4 o'clock then? Yes, all right. Yes, I can have it done by 4:00. Right, and I'll get, uh, Robert to sort out the tennis matches. I'm in favor of his idea anyway. - Oh, good, thank you. Good, so come in around, uh, 4:00ish with the copy, and we'll have some yak's milk and sheep's eyes, OK? Uh, tea, tea, tea-- about 4 o'clock, we'll have tea. OK, John, yes. Um, right, fine. And, uh, any problems, you let me know straight away, OK? I mean, uh, you know, don't moan about them later. I mean, come and talk to me. We'll be able to sort everything out, OK? Fine. [HUMMING] Do you see, master? Well, she certainly seems more cheerful. - Of course. - But for how long? Oh, she will always be a moaner. You can't expect to change that. But if you manage her well, she will be an efficient worker who happens to be a moaner. And you must manage her well because in the long run it will save you time. Let me show you. - It's tomorrow, right? Oh, yes, so it is. Hello. Oh, uh, Minnie, John here, how's it going with the marketing supplement for the magazine? Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, um, we must put a rocket up it. Shall I call him for you now? Uh, if I do that, you will make the deadline? Yes, fine, I'll do it. Bye. You see, it's better to spend a little time on making that extra phone call that gets the job done than to waste much more time later on, hearing why she hasn't managed do it. And if you do, then in time, maybe this sort of thing will happen. John, there's been a bit of a problem. I sent the front cover off to the printers with a note about the typeface, but they messed up the layout. So it's going to be a few hours late, but I'm going to go down there and make sure that they get it right. I'm terribly sorry. I thought they could be trusted to do it. Well, it's a nuisance, but it can't be helped. Oh, well, thanks for telling me. Perhaps we could learn something from it? Exactly, my fault, I should have made sure they knew precisely what I wanted. So stupid of me. Anyway, I'll bring it up as soon as it's ready. Mind you, they haven't a clue, you know. You'd think by now they'd know the difference between Galliard and Garamond typing. [COMPLAINING] [CLANGING] You see, master, still moaning, but getting the job done nevertheless. But will that really happen? Well, that's up to you, light of my life. You must begin to show her that she is a part of the company again, and not a slave. Slaves are never happy, master. But you, you're a slave. I know. Oh, well, one good turn deserves another. Is there anything I can do for you? Oh, master, it has long been my ambition to go freelance. Well, um, how can I help? - Smash the lamp, master. - Why don't you do that? Do you know, I'd never thought of that. Thank you, master. [CLANGING] Thank you, master. Farewell. Farewell. Farewell. John, what's happened? Are you all right? I'm, uh, um, yes, fine, fine, fine. No, yeah, I just, um, dropped that old, uh, that old lamp. That's all, just-- just dropped it. So, uh, Minnie. Right, no, well, look at this. The printers have messed up the classifieds. I never approved this. "Registered genie, available for Masonic functions, bar mitzvahs, children's parties." I mean, I ask you. Oh, I think, uh, I think we should leave it in, Minnie. It might get a laugh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Managing Minnie isn't different from managing anyone else, but certain rules are particularly important. Give her clear priorities. Kathy is out of the office all day today, and I've got to go down to stores to get some more floppy disks. Yes, well, there are some important things today, Minnie, and one of them is to get that page remade. And, uh, then we must produce a laser-printed copy of page 17 so that I can check Ron's article. Page 17, it's not ready yet, page 17. Right, well, those are the two things that we need done today. Agree her deadlines with her. Can you have it done by this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? No, that's not early enough. Um, uh, can I get you some help? Get her personal commitment to deliver. Now is there anything else you've got to do? Um, no, no, no. All right, well, let's say, uh, 4 o'clock then? Yes, all right, yes I can have it done by 4:00. Monitor her progress and help her out. Oh, uh, Minnie, John here. How's it going with the marketing supplement for the magazine? Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, um, we must put a rocket up it. Shall I call in for you now? If I do that, you will make the deadline? Yes, fine, I'll do it. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] Three days and no sign of a case. You know, Watson, it's at times like these that I sometimes think I may be too clever. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Well, it's beginning to look as if there are no problems or adventures left in the world. I've solved everything. You couldn't manage that crossword the other day. - Watson. - Yes, sir? - Be quiet. - Oh, right, sir. If only I-- [RINGING] Wait. Wait. Do you hear that? - Hmm? The client bells, come on, man. Look busy. - Oh, right. Oh, yes, come in. Well, Watson, I think we can tell his royal highness that he need worry himself no further. If my deductions are correct, it looks-- yes, what is it? Mr. Holmes? Yes, I am he, and this is my friend and adviser, Dr. Watson. I'm sorry to intrude, gentlemen, but I'm at my wits end. Look, I can see you're busy. I'll come back again. - No, no, please, I beg you, be seated. - That's very kind. I have just come to the end of a fascinating case. Well, I'm not quite sure where to begin. Um, my name is Maureen Sullivan, and I am a-- Personnel manager for a company based in the Midlands or the Northwest? Coventry, I should guess. You are unfamiliar with London, and you have two children. But this is witchcraft. Oh, no, Mrs. Sullivan, it is simplicity itself. You're carrying a Euston Station shopping back. Euston is the railway terminus which services the Midlands and the Northwest. Judging from the time of your arrival here, you came off the 335 from Coventry. You arrived by cab. I heard the squeal of the breaks in the street below. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of London would know that it is quicker to walk from Euston to Baker Street rather than to endure the hazards of the Marylebone Road by cab in rush hour. There is a loose leaf protruding from your file of effects. It is a personnel form. You are too well dressed and have too much the manner of somebody who is accustomed to command for me to believe that you are anything other than a manager. I see from the inside of your shopping bag that you have been buying some toys. One is a remote control car, and the other a rattle. I cannot believe they are for the same child. Hence, I deduce that you have two. - That's brilliant. - No, no, elementary, I assure. Oh, I thought it was rather clever, but if you think not then-- All right, well, it was really quite brilliant. Now, Mrs. Sullivan, tell us the nature of your problem, omitting no detail, however slight. Right, well, as you've already deduced, Mr. Holmes, I have recently been made personnel manager for Macaulay Ross in Coventry. They manufacture packaging equipment. Well, it's an excellent job, but every silver lining has its cloud. And mine comes in the shape of Wendy. Wimpy Wendy I call her, because every day it's the same thing. So I'll expect to put some ads in the magazine. Kevin, I'll call you back. [CLEARING THROAT] Yes, Wendy? Sorry to interrupt you, Maureen, but I've got Mr. Enright from dispatch outside. He wants to know whether or not he's entitled to an extra day off because of his coming in to work on New Year's Day. Well, I thought he was, but I thought I ought to check it with you because if he wasn't, and I had said he was, and then he wasn't, well, he'd blame me, wouldn't he, for saying that he was. Yes, all right, Wendy, well, the thing is he earned a lot of overtime, didn't he, for working on New Year's Day. And I really think it's up to him if he wants to give up the holiday. Ah, no, you see, Mr. Proctor actually asked him to come in. I've got Mr. Proctor's note here. He didn't want to give up his holiday at all. Yes, you see, and under Article 19 of the 1976 Trades Union Agreement, he is actually entitled. - Well, then, you're right. - Yes. - Sorry, is he entitled or not? - Yes. Yes, that's what I thought. Thank you very much. Well, I just thought I'd run that by you. - Fascinating. - Hmm? - Oh, uh, fascinating. - That's not all, gentlemen. I've outlined below the precise job description for three posts to be filled in the quality control department. And I'd like-- um, Wendy, how can I help? Sorry to bother you, Maureen. Um, but Mr. Jarvis from accounts has lost his car park card. You know, the one that lifts the barrier. Well, we're not supposed to issue duplicates until a week has passed in case he finds it. And anyway, we don't want too many cards in the system because you know the trouble there. Anyway, I've told him he can use the general car park this week, but he's ever so angry. I thought I ought to tell you about that. No, well, you're quite right, Wendy. You'll just have to tell him you're simply not allowed to issue duplicates. I mean, he should know this. I'm sure he's just stringing you along. Along isn't he, Maureen? That's right. Thank you. Holmes, this is fantastic, isn't it? I would like to offer them for internal application and would therefore be grateful if you would run the ads in the in-house magazine for next week. - Wendy, how can I help you? - Sorry to butt in like this, Maureen. It's just Sally from marketing. You know, she took a few days off last week because she said she wasn't feeling very well. Well, she's pregnant. It's that nice? Yes, anyway, she wants to know whether or not she's entitled to maternity leave. The problem is she's only been working here for a year full time, and really you should work for the company for two years before you're entitled. Have you explained that to her? Yes, but it's a bit more complicated than that because she's actually been working for us for five years, part time, you see. So technically, she's not eligible, but, of course, it is discretionary. Her manager has no objection. I wondered if-- What is normal procedure? Well, normally, Maureen, we would, in fact, say yes. - Then, yes. - Thank you, Maureen. So you see, gentlemen, it just makes my life so difficult because I'm doing her job as well as mine half the time. She's just such a wimp. Hmm, this is not an uncommon problem, Mrs. Sullivan. Would I be right in thinking, I wonder, that she has been in trouble at some stage for taking a decision that went awry? That is amazing, Mr. Holmes, yes. It was before my time, but apparently she authorized the use of a company car to somebody who wasn't entitled to it, which meant that everyone else then wanted it. She got into a terrible row. - Hmm, a piquant little problem. - Do you mind if I smoke? - Yes. I thought so. Never mind. Watson, guard the door. We don't want her coming back again for the moment. What I have to tell you, Mrs. Sullivan, may come as a surprise to you. But it is you who are in many ways responsible for this situation. I? You are clearly an administratively skilled manager, but there are human skills a manager needs, too-- devices and techniques which enable you to handle problem people. It is your otherwise very commendable patience and willingness to advise and to listen to people that encourages Wendy to turn to you to back up her every little issue. But I thought-- You thought that good managers encourage subordinates to come to them, correct? But good managers also encouraged subordinates to think for themselves. Tell me this. If she took the decisions herself, would they be the right ones? Well, yes, I mean, she knows her job backwards. Then you must make her take them. But I did tell her from time to time that she is-- well, she's so insistent. Telling is not always the answer. Oh, good heavens, what on Earth is that? What? You see, I didn't tell you to get up and look over the desk. If I had, you might have questioned me. I made you look over the desk. That is a cheap trick, Mr. Holmes. At that level, yes, it was, but there are higher levels of managerial skills which are as effective. You can use them to make Wendy take decisions. - How? - Be too busy. Wave her away. Be as friendly as you like, but make her decide for herself. Right, I'll try it. - Watson. - Huh? - Move away from the entrance. - Right-o. Hello, Martin. I was wondering whether you would like to sit on the panel of interviewers for the northeast area sales manager next week. Yes, well, I really think that this time-- hang on a minute, Martin. Sorry to interrupt you, Maureen. I'm on the phone at the minute, Wendy. Uh, the thing is, Martin-- No, it won't take a minute. It's just about the supervisor vacancy. That's all. Ah, now you deal with that, Wendy. Um, I'll send you the job applications and the job descriptions and-- - Well, I just wondered-- - Hang on a minute. Just wondered-- I just wondered where we should advertise it. That's all. That's up to you. You decide that, Wendy. Um, I'll have seven internal and three external. - But Maureen-- - Yes. - Maureen. - Um, Wendy, you decide. It's up to you. I'll go along with whatever you choose, OK? Well, we've decided not to do that this time, Martin. Mm-hmm, well, the main problem was the salary level. I think that could be difficult, too. It really is a policy question, and I think we have to watch out in case the other sales managers get up in arms about it. I think the best idea is if we leave it at this rate. And then if nothing happens, then we'll just have to think again, yeah, OK. I don't believe it. - That's the major step. She will, however, be a little worried now. She will try you again. You must be strong. Perhaps the most effective way of building up her confidence is to reverse the whole process. - Meaning? - Do to her what she does to you. Oh, you mean bombard her with questions all day so she sees what misery it is? Not quite, ask her advice on an issue where she herself is more knowledgeable than you. She's been here longer, after all. If you seek her advice, it will give her a stronger opinion of herself. She won't think me weak? The skill of management is knowing how to manage, not knowing every fact in the universe. Good managers always seek the advice of those who know the most. Oh, and always praise her when she takes the decision. Right, I'll try. Jill, could you get me Leo Colston's number, please? - Wendy. - Maureen, sorry. I know you're very busy. - No, don't worry. Actually, I'm glad you popped in, Wendy. I was about to come look for you myself. - Oh, were you? - Yeah, come in. Take a seat. It's about Leo Colston, the new area sales manager. Well, you know, his job is actually graded between manager and senior executive, and I'm actually not sure what group of car he would be entitled to. What do you think? Oh, that's the same sort of grade as the senior research chemist. Now he has a sort of in-between grade, and he drives a group B. Perhaps this chap should have the same. Well, of course, that's a good idea. Here is his CV, by the way. Take a look. See what you think. Oh. Oh, but he looks ideal, doesn't he? Mm-hmm, well, I'll be ringing him in a minute. I'll tell him about the car. Right, oh, I see he used to work for Pinchart's. Now they don't offer private medical insurance. Perhaps you ought to mention that we do. Good thinking, yes, I'll do that. Thank you. - Right. - Thank you. - Right. Oh, Wendy, um, what did you do about the supervisor ad? Oh, I put it in the recorder because we only got one response to the gazette last time. Excellent, all right, well done. Thank you. - Thank you, Maureen. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - Thank you. You see? She actually forgot what she came in to ask me. First, you set them on their own two feet by being unavailable. Secondly, you build up their confidence by seeking their advice yourself. And thirdly, you praise them warmly every time they take a decision without coming to you. The wimps of this world are only wimps because we let them be. Perhaps we even enjoy the superiority their own lack of confidence gives to us. But it wastes our time, and it stunts their growth. With cunning and good handling, they can be encouraged to believe in themselves. Well, I can't thank you enough, Mr. Holmes. [COUGHING] - Holmes. - Yes, Watson? - My gloves. - Yes? You must find them for me. Have you left them behind? Well, that's what I thought. I took them off to undo my overcoat. I didn't hand them to anybody because there wasn't anybody there. And they're not in my pocket, so where are they? - You tell me. - Well, you're the detective. - I am too busy. - Oh, dash it all, Holmes. I mean, you-- behind. [CHUCKLING] Oh, oh, Holmes, wimps can be very valuable if you're prepared to work on them. Every Holmes should have one. [MUSIC PLAYING] Wendy needs more self-confidence, but so do most people. So the rules for helping Wendy are the rules for helping everyone realize their potential. Make her take decisions. - Maureen? - Yes. - Maureen? Um, Wendy, you decide. It's up to you. I'll go along with whatever you choose, OK? Ask her advice. It's about Leo Colston, the new area sales manager. Well, you know, his job is actually graded between manager and senior executive, and I'm actually not sure what group of car he'd be entitled to. What do you think? Praise her when she shows initiative. Oh, I put it in the recorder because we only got one response to the gazette last time. Excellent, all right, well done. [MUSIC PLAYING] - Go on then, Debbie, what sign are you? - Hmm? - What sign are you? - Oh, Virgo. Virgo, right, "don't allow personal worries to interfere with your work today. Your romantic problems have a habit of sorting themselves out." Oh, if only. - Judy? Sagittarius. Oh, you're the same as me. "A voice from the past may well upset your equilibrium today. Those in authority will seem to pick on you. You may be irritated, but do not be blind to your--" Linda, have you completed the late payments list yet? - No, Betty. - Well, do please get on, dear. You're the only one. - Yes, Betty. You'll never guess whose birthday it is today. Mickey Rock-- oh, don't I fancy him? Did you see him in that film with Bob Hoskins? I went with Terry. Terry got really jealous. It was so funny. Did I show you those photographs of me and Terry after our engagement party down at Springer's? Yes. Oh, right, it's only 12 o'clock. I'm just off down to the lady's, all right? My mousse hasn't set properly. Oh, dear. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Mr. Morton, yes, we haven't quite finished yet. Well, you know what the girls are like. Yes, Mr. Morton, as soon as possible, thank you, sir. Whatever am I going to do with that wretch of a girl, Linda? She is such a scatterbrain. Of course, what she needs is a nanny. [KNOCKING] Good heavens. [HARP PLAYING] Good lord. - Hello, Nanny Goodbody, how do you do? - What-- Well, I've come in answer to your advertisement. - Advertisement? - The girl needs a nanny, you said. Well, so here I am. Well, let's get on with it, shall we? Hustle bustle, time doesn't grow on trees, you know. - Well, um, it's about Linda. - Linda, eh? She doesn't eat her custard? - No, not exactly. - She doesn't brush her teeth? - No, that's not it at all. - Refuses to tidy her bedroom? - No, it's just that she's lazy. Lazy? Lazy Linda, where is she? Well, here she comes now on her way back from the bathroom. She spends a lot of time there, doing her nails and her makeup. The rest of the time she spends gossiping. I mean, what she does, she does well. I grant her that. She's a very bright girl. I think that's half the problem really. She gets bored. Bored? No such word. Are you firm with her? Well, I don't like to nag her. I mean, that wouldn't do any good. She thinks of me as a sort of school teacher. Besides which, I've got five other girls to supervise and my own job to do. I can't possibly run after her all day. That young lady would be a lot more cheerful if she bustled. Yes, well, if you'll excuse me, I must go see if the late payers list is completed. I'll come with you. No, no, I don't think that's such a good idea. She won't be able to see me or hear me. Well, if you're sure. What a strange nursery. What exciting toys. Linda, have you finished? - Not yet, Betty. - Well, why not? - All of the other girls have. - How far have you got? Well, if the other girls were to give me a hand, I could be finished in five minutes. Oh, well, I suppose-- No, no, no, she must finish her work herself. But it's nearly lunchtime. - What? - Nothing, dear, nothing. Just make her do it herself. The others have all got their own work to do. You can go when you're finished. But Terry's waiting. Well, he'll just have to wait, won't he? Well, he'll-- he'll just have to wait, won't he? But I promised him I'd be off at 12:30. You can go as soon as you have finished. You can go as soon as you've finished. Right, all right. Well, that's only temporary, of course. She'll whiz through her work and be finished before you can say Jack Robinson, or before you can say Jack Robinson a few hundred times anyway. I don't want to keep treating her like a child, but she's just so lazy. It is you who are lazy, Betty Sargent. - Me? Yes, lazy or timid, now have you had a real heart to heart with her? Well, I have told her to hurry up, yes. No, no, no, no, a heart to heart, tell her how unhappy her behavior is making you. - Well, surely she must know. - Well, obviously, she doesn't. So all change, new broom, clean sweep. I don't like to-- Nobody likes to, but managers have to. You must be frank and firm. Well, you must always be firm. You must always strive to be firm because firmness is all. Well, I'm sorry, but this is not a Victorian nursery. I don't want to treat my employees like naughty schoolchildren. Besides, I treat her exactly the same way as I treat all the other girls, and they do their work just fine. Hmm, everyone is different, and that's my rule. Those girls are human beings. I mean, what sort of manager would you be if all you had to do was switch on a few machines? You must do more than that. You must manage six separate individuals. So hustle bustle, let's get on with it, shall we? - I'm too busy. - Too busy? No one is too busy to do their job, or else what are they busy doing? It doesn't take more time to be firm or to explain to your manager why the work isn't being done. - Yes, yes, you're right. - I'm always right. It's one of my most endearing qualities, you'll find. - So you'll talk to her? - Yes. - And be firm? - Yes. Kind but firm, and that's the ticket. Praise where possible, and enlist that girl's pride. - Finished. - Oh, good, off you go then. No, no, no, we must check it first. Oh, yes, good idea. Let's have a look then, Linda. You said I could go for lunch. Well, you can, but I'd like to check it first. I must say, you were splendidly quick. Well, uh, this is under 90 days, and this one is over 90 days. Excellent, these are very good. Now why couldn't you have done this earlier? I had a paper jam, and then my nail broke. Excuses, now we're not at home to excuses. Now we're not at home to-- the others seemed to manage it, didn't they? I expect you'll be wanting your lunch, won't you? Now hustle bustle. - Hustle what? - Hustle bustle, Linda. Right, now after lunch, you start a new regime with that young lady. - I do? - You do. You must make it clear to her that she must finish her work allocation on her own and on schedule. You must be firm and insistent. Stick to your guns. - Stick to my guns. Yes, in fact, I've got a rule about that. If you sugar the pill-- - They work with a will. Oh, you knew it. Well, she'll soon find out that laziness has its own punishment, and diligence its own reward. Congratulate her on a job well done, though. I mean, praise pays. - Praise pays. - Of course, it does. I mean, after all, a little flattery is the butter on the toast. Will it work? Of course it will work. I never fail. That's one of my least endearing qualities-- but first, the heart to heart, all out in the open. [CHATTER] They're coming back from lunch. - Then call her in. - Linda. Courage, Betty Sargent. Take a seat. Now it's time you and I had a little talk, Linda. Now it's time you and I had a little talk, Linda. - What about? - About you. About you, Linda, and your work. Well, it just won't do, you know. And you're not too old to be spanked. - Is anything the matter, Linda? - What do you mean? Well, it's just that you are one of the brightest girls in the office. Your typing is fast and accurate. But you don't seem to get through as much work as anyone else. Now wait. Let her own up. I had a paper jam. All the others have paper jams, too. You see, if the others see you getting through less work than them, they wonder why they're bothering, don't they? - I-- I can't-- - Can't is a word we never use. Can't what, Linda? I don't know. You see, this is an efficient department. People respect us, but not if we hand in our work late. And time and time again, you've let us down. You've let yourself down. It's so boring. Well, not every job, surely. All the one's you've given me. Well, that's because the other girls finish their routine jobs first. Oh. So what are we going to do about it? We can't go on like this. Well, if it was more interesting-- All right, if you can promise me that you'll try and do your work more quickly, I'll see if I can find more interesting things for you to do. What about that? Yeah, that's-- that's good. Right then, back to work. I'd like you to take out some credit references for me on some potential clients. I believe you did it rather well last time, and the other girls in the office don't seem to understand the lists we get. Well, it takes some getting used to. That's all. - Very well then. And remember, Linda, I shall be watching you like a hawk. And remember, Linda, I shall be watching you like a lynx. Yes, Mrs. Sargent. Remember, Linda, like a lynx. Hmm, hawk was better, I think. I prefer lynx. Well, I must be off now so hustle bustle. Oh, must you go? Yes, you don't need me anymore. Just remember-- be firm, fair, and friendly. Oh, and if you ever get worried or depressed, there's a little something you should learn. Working works, and shirking hurts. But work is hurt when shirking works. - But that's impossible. - Why? Well, I'll never learn something like that. Oh, of course, you could, with a little practice. Goodbye. Working works, and shirking hurts. But work is hurt when shirking works. That's it. That's it. I've got it exactly right. Nanny, Nanny, I've got it exactly right. Oh, what a shame she didn't hear it. I got it exactly right. I said, worky shirtsy fartsy-- working shirts you. Work your shirts-- something like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Linda is a difficult case, but the rules for dealing with her are good rules for everyone. Talk over her behavior in a frank, firm, and friendly way. You see, this is an efficient department. People respect us, but not if we hand in our work late. And time and time again, you've let us down. You've let yourself down. Make her meet performance standards. The others have all got their own work to do. You can go when you're finished. Praise her good work. Back to work-- I'd like you to take out some credit references for me on potential clients. I believe you did it rather well last time. Reward her improvement. All right, if you can promise me that you'll try and do your work more quickly, I'll see if I can find more interesting things for you to do. What about that? - Yeah, that's good. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRASHING] Stand back, Gathron, or I'll blast you to the other end of the galaxy. [WHOOSHING] Oh, bother. Um, excuse me. Oh, hello. Oh, don't be frightened. - Who are you? My name is Zon. Can you tell me what planet we're on? What-- what pla-- what planet? Earth, where else? - Earth. - Yes. Oh, well, that's all right then. Oh, well, I'm sorry to intrude. The fact is, one of those things. You know what I mean? One minute, you're facing Gathron Stinkbender, one of the worst pirates in the nebula. The next, you walk through a tear in the fabric of the universe. Goodness knows when it'll open up again. You-- you mean to say that you're stuck here? Could be for some time. Oh, it doesn't matter. When I do go back, it'll be exactly where I left off. Well, you can't stay here. I'm busy. I can't have my office cluttered up with creatures from outer space. Well, I could go back, but I would need certain things to help me open up this time portal again. What sort of things? Oh, I'm afraid they're very rare and valuable. There is a precious solid-state liquid we call glass. I'd need a nugget of that. Like this, you mean? Good Lord, it must be worth millions of botliks. Where did you get it? - Bournemouth. - It's amazing. - What else do you need? Uh, there is a substance called water which flows on the planet Schtun. Is this the stuff you mean? I can't believe it. Is this all you need? Yes, but I'm afraid I haven't got a single botlik on me. Is there some other way I could repay you? Well, I expect our computer systems must seem very primitive to you, but-- I'm sorry. I can't help with technology. The first rule of time travel, book 1, page 1, paragraph 1-- no technical assistance. Well, I don't suppose you have any advice on how to deal with people. Oh, yes, I could do that. - Really? - Oh, yes. Well, I have this chap who works under me, Sam. He's a systems analyst. Lazy, rebellious, incompetent? No, no, no, hard working, extremely clever in his way, it's just that he never seems to contribute anything. He never comes up with ideas at meetings, lets us go on planning things, and never tells us about the snags. - And why would he do that? - I don't know. Perhaps I had better see for myself. How far back in time do we need to go? Three months. [WHOOSHING] So the branches just key in the delivery nodes, and the data goes straight to finance and stock control simultaneously. Which means the job only has to be done once, instead of three times, and accounts can pay in time to claim maximum discounts. - Yeah. - And you've got the terminals anyway. That's marvellous. Brilliant. Oh, by the way, would it help to do away with sending attendance sheets? - Could we really do that? - Oh, yes, I think so. Have a look. [PHONE RINGING] Excuse me. Yes? - Sam, Hillary, can you come up? Yes, now, it's about an idea I've just had. Nick and Sarah are coming, too. We need a brainstorming session. Right, see you. [KNOCKING] Come. Oh, good, coffee? - No, thanks. - I'll get it. How was your weekend? - Oh, not bad, you? - Can't complain. - Oh, Sam, great, uh, sit yourself down. - Coffee, Sam? Right, look. Um, you all know that garment sales are seriously under budget. I've come to the conclusion that we ought to offer a greater rate. - Uh, fitting range or fashion range? - Fashion. We need more lines. Action togs are the people to go to. Their stuff is moving very fast. Yeah, but we've taken most of their range already. Uh, yes, women's wear, but suppose we add their men's wear range. Wow. Yes, 70% of their men's wear is bought by women. - That could really move. - Sam? - Well, it needs a bit of thinking about. - What does? - Um, stock allocation. - What about it? - Well, I need a bit of time. - Time is what we haven't got. Fitwear are already [INAUDIBLE] their summer range. - Yeah, we'll move fast. - Can we make space in the stores? Sure, we can, with the expansion program. About how many do new lines? We don't know till we try it. Apart from action togs, who else could we go to? What about KBJ made to wear? Wow, they do a super range in men's wear. Can you get some quotes? - Would there be, uh-- - Yes? Would there be reductions in the other lines? Not necessarily. I mean-- And if we get the slick stores and the KBJ reps to come around here tonight and see if they can pull up some new ideas. Yes, you do that. And, Nick, have a word with the store managers, will you? - Mm-hmm. - Anything else? What about publicity? Uh, point of sale should be enough. Get me some spreadsheets. - Could there-- - Yes? Could there be more than 15 new lines net? - Easily. - Bound to be. - Uh, well-- - Problems? Uh, no. Could we get action togs to pay some of the promotional costs? That's an idea. We could try it on them anyway. Anything else? - Nope. - Nope. Sam? [MUMBLING] - Sam? - Uh, sorry. No. No, good, meeting closed. [WHOOSHING] You see? Sam just won't contribute. That's the problem. He just clams up. - Does it matter? - Does it matter? Do you know what happened? - Yes. - How? We're 3,000 years ahead of you. The system couldn't cope with the extra lines. Couldn't allocate stock in time. The warehouse people were twiddling their thumbs all Monday and half Tuesday. Empty shelves in the stores. - Angry customers. - Frustrated staff. And then we had to take on extra vans and extra people to rush stuff through at the end of all of it. And two days later, Sam's report arrived and told you all of this would happen. But he sat through that meeting and never said a word. - Why? - Don't ask me. Some sort of deficiency, I suppose. Exactly, a deficiency-- a malfunction of the manager. - The manager? - Yes, the manager. Do you mean me? Yes, you. Look. I'm busy. If you haven't got anything sensible to say, you'd better time warp yourself out of here. It wouldn't help. Remember, I am 3,000 years ahead of you. It's a question of close destination. You have to listen. Soda pop? - Not at the moment. You see, a manager's job is to use his resources. Now Sam is a valuable resource, and you are not using him. But my way works. Look at Nick and Sarah. It doesn't work with Sam. You see, all you others are articulate. You think quickly. Sam thinks deeply. You're good with words. He's good with flow charts. You like to express your ideas in meetings. - He expresses his on paper. - So? So give him time, time to think, and time to communicate his thoughts. Even so, he must have seen what would happen. Does he understand merchandising? Does he know what days the goods have to be in the stores? No. Then he could equally say that you should have known what would happen. He told you about the stock allocation program. - Yes, he mentioned it, but-- - Well, he thought that was enough. It was obvious to him. He didn't know how ignorant you were. With Sam, you have to give him time to think and time to speak and not spring meetings on him with only five Earth time units notice. Minutes. Minutes, give him space. Give him encouragement. The others will force themselves into the conversation. It's your job to drag Sam in. Praise him. Encourage him. Make him realize his contributions matter. And that does the trick? One more thing, don't understand his technical jargon. Make him spell it out in plain English. You mean, play the technical moron? - Will that be difficult? - No. Oh, and when he does make an observation, ask him to explain how it affects the matter in hand. Like warning me that we'd have empty shelves on Monday and Tuesday? - Exactly. - Yes, well, it's too late now. No, it's not. [BEEPING] Good heavens, how did you do that? Simple phase quantizing at the temporal stream loop. Oh. Sam? Hillary, look. I've got an idea about increasing our garment revenues, all the stores. Yes, yes, I'll send you a note. Have a think, and then we'll talk to Nick and Sarah about it. All right? The 19th, great, bye. Now all we have to do is reconstitute the meeting. With the phased, um, what-- No, no, no, with the ergomotive time flip intensifier. [BEEPING] But suppose we add their men's wear range. Wow. Yes, 70% of their men's wear is bought by women. - That could really move. - Sam? Well, it needs a bit of thinking about. - What does? - Uh, stock allocation. - What about it? - Well, I'd need a bit of time. - Time's what we haven't got. - No, no, hold on, Nick. Go on, Sam. It's a question of the capacity of the stock allocation program. Presumably, you can cope with that somehow. Wait a sec. I'm sorry, Sam. I don't understand what you mean. Well, if there's more lines, it will take longer to produce the picking list. Well, we'll just have to-- how much longer? - I haven't worked it out yet. - Well, roughly. 24 hours, 48 perhaps, depending on the number of lines and volumes. And what would that mean? An extension of the master file, a new file-handling program. No, what will it mean for the business? Well, it would mean the warehouse wouldn't get the list until Tuesday. Tuesday? That's impossible. We have to get the garments in the stores by Tuesday. Are you sure, Sam? Yeah, if the figures in your note were right. Well, thank heavens you've told us. Is there anything you can do about it? Yes, I think we can. But it will mean expanding the CPU unit to handle the master file. - Is that expensive? - Not necessarily. - Um, how long? - Four to six weeks. It will take us that long to get the goods into the brochures. Great, Sam, that's marvelous. Can you start straightaway? - I will. [WHOOSHING] - You see? - You're absolutely right. It will be a while before it happens naturally. So all must give him time to think and time to talk. Protect him from the others. Draw him out. Encourage him. Make him translate his jargon, and make him explain what it means in business terms. Well, I'd better be on my way. Thank you for the glass and the water. [WHOOSHING] How did you do that? There's a battery in my pocket and a bulb up my sleeve. Farewell. [WHOOSHING] Sam, I've got a problem. Stand back, Gathron, or I'll blast you to the other end of the galaxy. Oh, no. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sam has a communication problem, and the rules for dealing with him are fundamental to communication technique. Give him time to think. Yes, yes, I'll send you a note. Have a think, and then we'll talk to Nick and Sarah about it. All right, the 19th, great, bye. Defend him from the sharpshooters. - What about it? - Well, I need a bit of time. - Time's what we haven't got. - No, no, no, hold on, Nick. Go on, Sam. Make him explain in layman's language. And what will that mean? Extension of the master file, a new file-handling program. No, no, what will it mean for the business? Oh, well, it would mean the warehouse wouldn't get the list until Tuesday. Show him that his contribution is appreciated. Are you sure, Sam? If the figures in your note were right. Well, thank heavens you told us.
