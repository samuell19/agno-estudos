Two tours in the Marines, four years as a police officer, I'd thought I'd seen everything. But nothing prepared me for the brutality I saw that day. Eight-year-old Rosie Hoffman had been viciously raped and beaten unconscious, and had stopped breathing. [breathing forcefully] With 8-year-old Rosie Hoffman, 1 felt like God was giving me another chance. [inhales sharply] Come on. Breathe.

I had no idea that Alcala could turn out to be one of the most prolific serial killers in history. At the time, I just wanted to kill him for what he did to that little girl.

You gotta be kidding me. How does a monster like this get out of his cage? [siren wailing in distance] Looking for detective Ryan. James Hamell. Call me Jim. Man, you made it down from Hollywood in record time, Detective. Once you said Rodney Alcala, I blared that siren all the way. Ten years of tracking that prick. How did you connect him to your missing child? You know, I put together a photographic lineup for the witnesses who saw a long-haired man taking photos of Tammy Jensen and a friend at the beach. Everyone points to the photo of Alcala. You know, if this turns out to be Alcala, there's no happy ending. We've popped this scumbag s0 many times, but he keeps getting back out. He knows how to work the system. [laughs] And now he's on TV! - Unbelievable. - Yeah. Dating Game no less. Yeah, recruiting lambs for the wolf. Only in America. Look, I really appreciate your help on this, Detective. - The clock's ticking on our missing girl. - Anything besides the beach ID? Not really. I want to bring him in. But since you know Alcala better than anyone, - I thought I'd talk to you first. - Yeah. You don't want to spook this guy. After he attacked Rosie Hoffman, he slipped through the cracks, disappeared for three years. - That was in '68, right? - Yeah. I was a beat cop then. I jumped on his trail as soon as I made detective. - Where'd you finally bust him? - You'll never guess.

Thanks, Grace. Come on, girls. We need to get back. We don't want to be late for snack time. - Um, Mr. Lee, take a look. - Doesn't that look like Mr. Burger? Pretty creepy, huh? Oh, dear God. +r [Hamell] As soon as I got the call from the FBI, 1 was on the next plane. Three years of chasing that bastard, and we could finally extradite his ass back to California and get justice for Rosie. Or so [I thought. And that's what we use now. This guy, George Eastman, came up with this in the 1800s, forever ago. - Rodney Alcala? - [siren wails] - LAPD Detective Hamell. - [girls scream] Drop! Drop it! Down. Hands behind your back. Suck up that fresh air, Alcala. My name is not Alcala! I'm John Burger! - [handcuffs clicking] - A kids camp? Really? - What kind of sicko are you? - You got the wrong man. I know what you did to that little girl. I didn't do anything. I'll be back! You'll seel Yeah. Okay. Thanks. All right, another Tammy Jensen sighting. Lady in Long Beach said her neighbor had our girl. The kid turned out to be the man's granddaughter. - Any update on Alcala? - Mm. Two more teenage girls ID'd the man in our composite. The day Tammy disappeared, he took pictures of them, too. Both girls say he was super nice. Yep. I'm not surprised. Alcala was a snake charmer. You moving in? Uh, someone said I could pay rent on this desk. - [opens drawer] - [liquor bottle clinks] If this is something that turns out to be a lead on our guy, the captain has cleared me to work the case with you. Are you obsessed with Alcala or what? - You got family, detective? - I'm working on it. Gotta get her to say yes. I was there. I was there. I saw what that perv did firsthand. And I promised Rosie and myself that I won't stop until he's stopped. He's not going to destroy any more families. So even after you nailed him, I mean, why-- why'd the DA cut a deal, you know? Should've put Alcala away for life. Rosie Hoffman's family split the country. You know, war, riots, protests, Kennedys, King assassinations, and this maniac attacks their kid? I mean, they didn't feel they were safe in America anymore. I hated their decision, but I totally understood it. So even after he's caught, they wouldn't come back. Without a victim, Alcala was given an indeterminate sentence of one to ten years. - Indeterminate. - Yeah. Determined by what? How well a prisoner behaves while in prison. It was before the law changed back, back when California's peaceniks thought that, you know, perverts could be "cured." Not a blemish on your prison record, Mr. Alcala. Your psychiatrist notes that you are considerably improved... and recommends early release. Ma'am, I deeply regret the pain and suffering I caused. During my time here, I have taken full advantage of the motivational therapy and self-realization classes. I've learned from my mistakes. What drove you to commit such a heinous crime on an 8-year-old child? Honestly, ma'am... at the time, my judgment was impaired by drugs. I am so sorry that I hurt that little girl. I'm ashamed, humiliated. They declared him rehabilitated after just a couple years. He was released in August of '74. But then, two months later, he abducted a 13-year-old at a bus stop. Her name was Sophie. [music playing throughout] [shift gears] Alcala asked if she needed a ride to school, and she said yes. Alcala took her to the cliffs, forced her to smoke a joint with him. - He rape her too? - Mm-mm. Park Rangers smelled the dope, saw them just in time. Alcala claimed that Sophie had given him the joint. - Son of a bitch. - She denied it, said he forced her there. The ranger didn't know who to believe and arrested the both of them. Jesus. Wait. But Alcala did go back to prison, right? Kidnapping, dope, assault on a minor, you think? The scum bucket was convicted only of parole violations and supplying a minor with drugs. - Unbelievable. - He got two and a half years. Another jailhouse shrink ruled him "re-reformed," and the nitwit parole board bought it again. [Rodney] Mama! Rodrigo! [Hamell] They released him in June of '77. [conversing in Spanish] Read it. It's all in there. My guess is, that's just the tip of the iceberg. You think he's capable of murder? What do you think I think, kid? [liquid sloshing] [grunts] Mrs. Alcala. I'm Detective Ryan. This is Detective Hamell. Mrs. Alcala. Rodney is not here. [Hamell] Where is he, Mrs. Alcala? Maybe out of town, working you know? Why do you need to speak to him? A little girl has gone missing. Every time a kid runs away from home, you question my Rodney. He make one mistake. Yeah, more than one, ma'am. - Your son is a convicted sex felon. - He said he was sorry, and paid for it with five years of his life. The doctor said he was rehabilitated. If Rodrigo did anything wrong, it was only because of what his no-good father did to him. Yeah. May we come in? Do you have a warrant? Sorry to bother you, ma'am. Tell your son to give us a call. Hey, tell me, was Rodney in town last Wednesday? That was the day that little girl disappeared, and Rodney was nowhere near the beach. He had a job interview at Knott's Berry Farm. I'm sorry. What did Alcala's parole officer say he's driving now? A Red Beetle. Why? I'll be damned. You think he's got another place? Okay. I say we push past the old lady, we go arrest this son of a bitch. What if he's got Tammy in there? No. Not his M.O. Not at his mother's house. What? What, does he got another place? Maybe. He's been doing this a long time. We can't push him. He's a smart bastard. [Rodney] Mamita, who was that at the door? [sighs heavily] - 1 don't want to find this kid dead. - If she is, and Alcala takes off, we're never going to find Tammy. But if we stay close enough, there's a chance he'll make a mistake. All right. We'll put our surveillance team on him night and day. There you go, kid. Maybe he'll cut us some slack, lead us right to her. [engine starts] Mamacita, who was that at the door? Who were you talking to? +r [camera shutters click] My beautiful Tammy is still out there somewhere. If you've seen her, please call the police. And if you have her... please, please, I beg you... let her come home. - [water running] - [Carol] And if you have her... - [turns off water] - please, please, 1 beg you, let her come home. Detective Ryan? I said I'd call. What are you doing to find my daughter? We have a 24-hour hotline, and we're following up on calls from L.A. to Orange County, okay? Your daughter's case is our main priority. But what about that creep on the beach that was taking all those pictures? Detective, I positively identified a mugshot of Rodney Alcala, who the officer said was a convicted pedophile. Yeah. We're looking at him, okay? In missing child like this, we check out every offender in the area. But this depraved son of a bitch was on the beach the day Tammy disappeared. What the hell was he doing there? I'm very sorry, ma'am. I'm not at liberty to discuss any particulars. [indistinct conversations] [Carol] And that's how justice works? A maniac's allowed to roam the streets while we pay the price? Ma'am, I swear to you, if we find out that Alcala or anyone else took your daughter, I will do everything I can to make sure he's locked up for good this time. How long was Alcala in prison before? Time served was about five years. And the rest of the time, he was out preying on young girls. Look, we are watching him. Watching him?! Arrest the bastard! My daughter's life is at stake! [erying] You're the police! You're supposed to be protecting us from people like him! He's a monster! He's a monster! Get that pervert behind bars. Who knows what else he's done? She's right. Who knows? [Hamell] / stil wonder what Alcala was doing when he was on the run in New York. The movers just left it in the street. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along. Oh, I'm glad to help. I can help you set it up, too. You know, I'm really good with beds. Cute, but I have a boyfriend. Well, I'm sure your boyfriend wouldn't mind me putting you in a movie.

Let's get some test shots so I can show Mr. Polanski. [camera shutter clicks] No. I'm a mess. You better go. My boyfriend is coming over after work, and I have to get ready. Oh, yeah. Sure.

We'd run down every possible lead and still didn't have enough to bring in Alcala. ...his relationship with the ex... And in my gut, I knew that Tammy wasn't alive. - I gotta tell you... - [closes drawer] Alcala is looking more and more like our guy. I talked to the manager of that auto store on 10th. On June 21st, the day after Tammy went missing, Alcala had the carpeting changed out in his car. Oh, my God. What? What do you think that means? He beat her up in his car? You think he killed her, don't you? Yeah, kid, that's exactly what I'm thinking. The more this goes on... Well, I'm waiting till the facts are in, Jim. - You're jaded, man. - Don't confuse jaded with realistic, kid. Stop. Stop calling me "kid," you burned out old fart. These fries are cold. Well, can we get Alcala's old carpeting? Store manager said, uh, they sent it to the dump. The guy that was working on it, uh... yeah, he said, hem uh, thought it was stained. Alcala wanted to change it out because he thought he'd spilled gasoline on it, and he wanted to get rid of the smell. [exhales deeply] - Sorry, Jim. I'm just... I'm tired. - Ah. [sighs] It's okay. It's okay. Welcome to the job. - [opens drawer] - [liquor bottle clinks] Thanks for the coffee. Here's what I don't get. Alcala's paroled from prison in June of '77. How does he get back to New York in July? Oh, he's a snake charmer. Convinced his parole officer he just had to go see his New York relatives. - He got relatives there? - Mm. Not that we know of. NYPD ID'd Alcala as a murder suspect. [camera whirring] her name was Helen Vogel, New York socialite. Her father owned nightclubs in New York and Los Angeles. Helen was rich, beautiful, and a little naive. She made friends everywhere she went. According to witnesses, one of those friends was a photographer named John Berger. [camera shutter clicks] I'm captivated by your beauty. Isn't that the campaign slogan for that perfume ad that you did? Oh, you must have me mixed up with— With another model. You're with Eileen Ford, right? I know that I've seen your face. You Vogue? Mademoiselle? You can't be a Cosmo girl. - [chuckles] Hardly. - [laughs] I've been photographed with celebrities at Ciro's, my dad's nightclub in Hollywood. That's it. Ciro's. I knew I'd seen you. I'm a professional photographer myself. - [man] Helen! - is that your boyfriend? One of my boyfriends. Hey, Tyler! I gotta go. John Berger. Let's do a session. I'd love to get you on film. Hey. Who's he? Oh, be cool. He's a fashion photographer. What was he talking to you about? Nothing. Don't be jealous, Tyler. John's not interested in having sex... at least not with me. Maybe with you. - Sorry. He's not my type. - He's not mine, either, unless you think I'm hot for gay guys. [Hamell] New York detectives found Alcala's John Berger alias written in Helen Vogel's diary A year later, the police found her skeletal remains in the exact location where Alcala had photographed his models. - Why didn't the DA go after him? - Gutless jurisprudence. Said he didn't have enough to make the case. Alcala did this. Everything fits. Jesus! - We're dealing with a murderer. - What I've been saying for years. And you brought him in for questioning in the Hillside strangling. Yeah. Yeah, he fit the profile. [sighs] Bastard had a strong alibi for the time and place of every Hillside murder, as if he knew we were gonna talk to him about it. Goddamn it! We gotta press him, force him to show us his hand. There you go, kid. [birds chirping] [wind gusting] Come on, Lori. Oh, my God. No. No, no, no, no! No! +r [voice breaks] No. [sniffles] You found her? Ms. Jensen, I'm, uh... I'm so sorry. [sobbing] [whispers] I'm sorry. I-l need to see her. Can I see her? I'm sorry. You wouldn't be able to identify the remains. Well, maybe it's not her. Are there any other blonde girls with long blonde hair that are missing? Ma'am... there was no hair. [wailing] The animals got to her. Look, there's nothing left. The only way we could identify her is through her dental records. [weeping] - Ahl - [laughs] - [TV] In the remote mountain area... - He's so good with your girls. They love their uncle Rodney, and he loves them. He's crazy about kids. I mean, it shows in his photos. He'll be a great dad. ...June 20th has been found. Police would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the young girl with this man on or near Huntington Beach on that day. +r Rodney, we're waiting for you! Whoa. You look like a completely different person. Well, you said do something about my hair, babe. I gotta keep it fresh. Besides, I have a job interview coming up. That's great, Rodney. Where? Well, this magazine in Dallas is looking for a photographer. Dallas? This is my shit-kicker, ivy league look. You're moving to Texas? - [pills rattle] - Thanks. Bye. [slurring] No. Joanne, no, that's okay. It's okay. We're gonna do it—- all that tomorrow. - Carol, you should really be careful... - [dishes clatter] ...mixing booze with those pills. Uppers? Hmm. Downers. Sleeping pills. It's the only way I can get through this. What's this? - You carry a gun? - Yes. I do now. I don't feel safe. [doorbell rings] - Hi. Come in. - Hi. - Carol. - [clears throat] Ma'am. - I'm sorry we missed the service. - We wanted to extend our condolences. I don't need your sympathy. I need justice. Why haven't you arrested Alcala? He's a murderer now. We still have to prove that. We're building our case. So when do you arrest him? As soon as we have enough evidence. Well, what else do you need? He was just arrested again in February for raping and almost killing another girl. [Joanne] A 15-year-old. She positively identified Rodney Alcala as the maniac who viciously raped her and beat her unconscious. [Hamell] It was earlier this year, the day before Valentine's Day. [Rodney] She's a runaway, mama. She was hitchhiking. Her name is Wendy. It started to rain, and she said she didn't have any place to stay. I felt bad for her. These crazy girls are always getting you into trouble, Rodrigo. Haven't you learned your lesson? Maybe you could talk her into calling her parents. You are too kindhearted, m'hijo. Tomorrow, you take her back to her own home, whether she wants to go or not. - ¢Entiendes? - Sf, mama. [rain pattering] My Mom's gonna fix you up a bed on the sofa. Did you take all these pictures? So artistic. I love ‘em. You know, lots of my friends say I should be a model. I have no problem being naked. One reason I ran away from home is my parents are such prudes. They got so mad when me and my girlfriend streaked the homecoming game. Got the crowd cheering. Hey, you really think I can be in Playboy? Oh, for sure. But you know Hef's rules. You gotta make it with him and blow movie stars in the grotto. - Ahl [giggles] - [laughs] - Wouldn't that make your folks flip out? - Ugh! Forget them. They've never even seen Playboy. They're total Bible thumpers, so against everything blacks, disco, democrats. You'd totally freak ‘em out. - [camera shutter clicks] - Me? Yeah. They hate fags. They say it's against God's law. But don't worry. I love gay guys! Maybe we'll do a few more close-ups, and I'll come in for some sexy action shots. Maybe you can put your shirt back on, and I'll shoot you taking it off. Hey, that's groovy. Maybe we can make the shirt wet, like Jackie Bisset in that movie with Nick Nolte? Oh, yeah, The Deep. That'd be groovy. She's so beautiful. - That's good. Great. - [giggles] [camera shutter clicking] That's good. Yeah. All right, now take it off. [grunts] [gasping] [humming softly] [voice breaks] Once, I had to bury a young boy. Are you okay, sweetheart? [breathing shakily] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad. I don't even remember what I said. I know I say things sometimes, without thinking. My best girlfriend, she gets so mad at me - when I run my mouth. - [moans] I know how disrespectful that is. Please, will you untie me? Please? You've been so nice to me. Can we just start all over, please? It's Valentine's Day, you know? Babe, I gotta go to the little boy's room. [singsongy] I Happy Valentine's day. I Don't be long. [motorcycles approaching] +r - [car engine starts] - Help! Help! Somebody help me! No! Stop! - Stop! Stop! He raped mel - [tires screech] He raped me and tried to kill me! Please! - Please? - Heyl [tires peal] - [engine starts] - [tires peal] [breathing heavily] You had him! Why didn't you keep him? Why was he out of jail... [voice breaks] and on that beach to murder my child? Alcala is— is— he's waiting for a trial date. His mother mortgaged her house to make his bail. How much? Ten thousand dollars. - [gasps] - [exhales sharply] Ten thousand dollars. That's what that judge thinks that my baby is worth, $10,000? [crying] [telephone rings] Alcala was working at the L.A. Times when you questioned him in the Hillside stranglings? "The most trusted newspaper in Los Angeles employs a rapist murderer." How's that for a headline? For Christ's sakes. Does no one do background checks? [clears throat] Uh, they-- they said you were in charge of that murder? The- the little gir? Tammy Jensen? I may have seen that man taking her up to where we found her body, maybe. You... you what? You saw them together? You said, "where we found the body." - You're one of the rangers? - Yes, sir. My name's Lori Carter. Uh, I-l thought I--] saw the body before, the-- the little girl's body, I mean, ‘cause I-—- ‘cause I sort of saw it there several days before. [exhales sharply] You saw... you saw... [coughs] you saw Tammy Jensen's body before July 2nd? When? What day? - No, I-I-l can't remember. - Come on, try. I was scared. I... I didn't even know what it was. It-- it didn't look human. The coyotes, they had they'd chewed off most of the face. And-- and... and the smell... Ugh. God! Il still smell it every day I drive past her. It stinks so bad. That's why I had to come here today. - 1 just I wanted it to stop. - All right. Okay. Okay. I want you to take a deep breath, Ms. Carter. All right? [Hamell] Is that the man you saw? I... could be, I guess. Sort of looks like him. Thank you, Lori. We can arrest him now. [Ryan] Looks like he cut his hair. - Likely making a run for Mexico. - Uh-huh. - Hey, when do we get that warrant? - DA said by the end of the day. But we may not be able to wait for it. You're a big help. Why are you taking all the stuff? Babe, I told you already. I'm just putting it all in storage until I see whether or not this Dallas job works out. Why not keep everything here? Look, I love my mom, but I can't go on living with her. Okay? I... we need a change. We gotta get away from here. Sure would like to know what's in those boxes. He gets down the street, we'll have him pulled over. I guarantee he'll give us probable cause. - Here we go. - [engine starts] - [static crackles] - He's leaving now. +r We're cutting down 23rd in case he turns down that way. [officer] Copy that. Standing by. Here he comes. He's turning left on Springfield. [Ryan] Stay with him. He goes west, Nelson and Bogden will pick him up at 17th. +r - [horn honking] - [tires screech] Goddamn it! We're blocked. We've lost him! Nelson, Bogden, do you see him? - That's a negative. - Damn it! Uh, try to catch him on the on-ramp. He'll be heading south. - [door rattles] - [grunts] - Open the gate, Mrs. Alcala. - Where is he? Why are you harassing my son? He's wanted for the murder of Tammy Jensen. Murder? That little girl? Just like he beat and raped Rosie Hoffman 11 years ago. No. Nol My-- my son is a good boy! Where is he, Mrs. Alcala? You need to stop lying for him. I don't know. He said Texas. You lie to us, you're going to jail as well as an accessory to murder! I'm not lying! That's what he said! But he's coming back. He always comes back. - Come on. - And he'll clear all of this up. - Come onl - You'll see! You'll seel [Hamell] After Alcala skipped town, we set up a 24-hour surveillance on his house. It was over a month since Tammy Jensen's murder, and 10 years after he attacked Rosie Hoffman. The bastard had escaped justice again and again and again, but not this time. +r - [gasps] - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! I don't want to wake mama. [whispering] Oh, my God, you scared me! How was Dallas? You get the job? Yeah. They love me. Run away with me. Let's get married. - Are you serious? - Uh-huh. - When? - Right now. Tonight. When we set up in Texas, we'll send for your family... ...and mine, and we'll have a big Mexican wedding. - [dog barking] - I can't believe this is happening. [officer] Rodney Alcala! This is the LAPD! Surrender. - Police! Police! - [pounding on door] [sirens wailing] Rodney Alcala, this is the LAPD! Surrender! [man speaking indistinctly] That's him! Surrender! - Police! Get down! - Get down! Freezel Get down! I said get down! - Get your ass down! - I told you he'd be back! [Hamel] Alcala, it's a relief to finally arrest you - for the murder of Tammy Jensen . - And God knows who else. No. You see? You see? I told you! Pleasel You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you... - Remember me, Alcala? - ...in a a court of law. - Remember me? - I don't know who you are. - [dog barking] - [grunts] - No! Nol! [screams] - Heyl Heyl - Rosie Hoffman. - [grunts] [speaks Spanish] Yo no lo hice. - What's this? - [speaks Spanish] Storage locker receipt? Seattle? What you got in there, huh? [storage locker door rattles] +r Holy shit! - There must be thousands of these. - Hey. Take a look at this. Souvenirs? - [phone ringing] - [indistinct conversations] [man] We should probably go ahead and get some more supplies. [continues indistinct] [Hamel] Did these belong to Tammy? [inhales sharply] No, those are mine. Tammy used to borrow them. [sighs] Thank you, Carol. We got him now. - We finally got him. - [exhales sharply] It was him... - [murmuring] - the man sitting right there. Rodney Alcala. He was pushing a young blonde girl in front of him into the brush. [defense attorney] How do you know it was Rodney Alcala? You said when you first saw the dark-haired man with the girl, - the sun was in your eyes. - Yes, sir, But, uh, I saw him again later that day, June 20th, in the same spot. He was alone this time. That's why I went back and saw the body. Oh, yes. That's, uh, five days later on June 25th. - Is that right? - Yes. Uh.. Yes, sir. June 25th. Five days after you first saw some dark-haired man on a hike with a kid who could have been his daughter, even his long-haired son. - Objection. Asked and answered. - Sustained. June 25th. Seven days before you and your fellow rangers went back and you found Tammy Jensen's remains, which you say you already knew were there. Is that correct? Um, uh... uh, yes. Ms. Carter, why on earth did you not call the police when you first saw a dead body? - [whispers] Come on. [mumbling] I didn't know if what I saw was real. It was horrible. - Sorry? - [judge] Speak up, Ms. Carter. Not real? - Not real. - [murmuring] So what, you thought it was a— a dream or a hallucination? I guess I thought... I hoped I imagined it. Oh, so you thought you imagined it. Ms. Carter, were you then or are you now on medication or recreational drugs? You mean, uh, was I high? Sure. No. - Were you high? - No! So you found a dead body. You allegedly saw the killer. Why did it take you so long to tell not just the police, but anybody about what you saw? The DA says she's recovering from a nervous breakdown. Is she gonna get through this? - We better hope so. - Ms. Carter, answer mel Why did it take you so long to tell anybody about what you saw? I was scared! It was too horrible. I had nightmares! It was easier to just try to forget about it and-and-and blame it on my imagination. In fact, you imagined at least six different versions! At least three or four in your statements to the police, a couple more during pretrial hearings, and now a different one right here in this court. Every time you make a statement, you change your story. Which are the lies, and why is this one the truth? The little girl's body was messed up. - [crying] - It had no hands or feet. The head was lying next to it, and, uh, most of the face was chewed off. [cries] For the love of GodI [sobbing] [murmuring] [gavel bangs] [judge] Let's take a quick recess. Reconvene in 15 minutes. Oh, my poor baby! That screwed-up ranger girl was our only hope. The jury knows Lori is traumatized. Joanne, come on, I know she's telling the truth, and even I don't believe her! That bastard is gonna get away again like he always does. No, he won't! He can't. He will pay. [murmuring] [handcuffs clinking] Mommy, no. +r Carol? Are you all right? Do you smell that? What? It's lemon. It's lemon, like Tammy's shampoo. She- she wouldn't want me to hurt anyone for her. [whispers] She wouldn't want that. Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor. How do you find the defendant? On the charge of first-degree murder-- guilty. - Oh! [crying] - [murmuring] +r [Hamell] He was sentenced to death. But four years later, after Alcala's execution date was set, the State Supreme Court ruled that admitting Alcala's prior crimes as evidence unfairly prejudiced the jury. It was unfair to say that this murderer had committed atrocities against other children? [scoffs] His conviction was overturned. Former Ranger Lori Carter - [buzzer] - refused to attend Alcala's second trial in 1986, claiming amnesia. So the judge allowed her 1980 testimony to be read. Again, thankfully, the jury found Alcala guilty and, again, gave him the death sentence. In 2002, a new California law allowed law enforcement to take prisoner DNA samples to maich crime scene evidence. - Nol - Correction officers - could use reasonable force... - No! [groaning] if a prisoner refused to comply voluntarily. Alcala's DNA began to get hits. Rodney James Alcala was now officially a serial killer. [buzzer] [indistinct conversations in distance] Hands. [handcuffs click] [Hamel] Before his trial, Alcala decided to fire his attomeys and represent himself. About 10,820 days, five hours, and 15 minutes ago, Tammy Jensen left on Becky Wilkins' bicycle and was never seen again. About 33 days and 16 hours later, I was arrested for Tammy's murder. Wrongly arrested. The prosecution's entire case is nothing but circumstantial evidence, theories, and blatant lies, which, fortunately, my first witness will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt. I call... - Rodney Alcalal - [murmuring] - [gavel bangs] - [murmuring continues] Uh, Mr. Alcala, the prosecution suggests that you were seen with the victim in the San Gabriel mountains, mid-afternoon on June 20th, 1979. Is that true? Not at all. I was miles away at Knott's Berry Farm on an interview. Uh, do you recall what time of day? I would say 3:10, 3:15. Okay, just to be clear, Mr. Alcala, it was afternoon and not the morning as the prosecution suggests. Yes. Afternoon. There was no way that I could have been in the mountains when the DA suggests. [whispers] Thank you. Now... Mr. Alcala, what do you say about those gold ball earrings that the prosecution has submitted as evidence against you? They're mine. Tammy Jensen's mother is a liar! Those earrings belong to me. Here's the proof. You can see me wearing them on this TV show taped months before her disappearance. [VCR whirs] you're gonna love me, Shauna. Get ready for an exciting evening. [man clears throat] [Hamell] Despite his circus performance, the jury found Alcala guilty. However, the trial's biggest surprise came when the DA announced that one of Alcala's victims would testify. Objection! None of the victims are alive. [murmuring] I mean, here. [DA] The people call Rosie Hoffman. [murmuring] [Hamell] The little girl that, by the grace of God, I had managed to save 42 years ago, all grown up. We never gave up. [voice breaks] This is your day. +r [Rosie] 1 was 8 years old in 1968. 1 trusted people. I knew only innocence. That man... lured me into his car and raped and tortured me until the edge of death. [murmuring] [voice breaking] I don't believe I was his first victim. It was so routine for him. He enjoyed it too much. During the assault, do you remember that I apologized to you? - [murmuring] -l.. [gavel bangs] -l.. - [gavel bangs] I was 8 years old. If life was fair and our legal system wasn't so broken, they would've put you away for what you did to me, unable to harm another girl. I got off easy. A good Samaritan and a dedicated police officer rescued me. Tammy Jensen and all the other girls weren't so lucky. But didn't I apologize to you? Do you not remember? [Carol] Where's the justice? It's 30 years. Two guilty verdicts, two death sentences, countless appeals, millions of of wasted tax dollars. In 1980, I brought a loaded pistol into the courtroom. I was determined to avenge my daughter and get justice by shooting you— - shooting you dead. - [murmuring] [gavel bangs] And I know this sounds crazy, but... Tammy stopped me. I could— I could smell her— her lemon shampoo. I could... I could feel her presence. And I believed that the court would have done a better job than me. But... [sighs] I was wrong about that. +r My sweet Tammy will never... feel her first kiss, or stress over passing her first driver's license exam. She'll never experience life's milestones... like prom night, or cramming for college finals, or... her wedding night, motherhood. And I lost the simple joy of seeing my baby's smile forever. Objection! This hysterical woman is just ranting and venting. - No! You don't get to talk. - [gavel bangs] How dare you! I am here to speak on behalf of all the lives you destroyed. - So don't mitigate mel - [sighs] - And don't minimize them! - Overruled. Now sit down and be quiet, Mr. Alcala. You may continue. I- used drugs to cope. I nearly killed myself. But then one day, in— in a in a stupor, I realized that... it was my Tammy who got justice for us all. She stopped you. Thanks to her, you've been rotting behind bars all these years. She stopped him. Since her death, he's been locked up and unable to hurt anyone. My 12-year-old child stopped the world's worst serial killer.
