WINNETOU AND HIS FRIEND OLD FIREHAND Derks, catch those other Mustangs! - Okay! Come on, let's get those critters! Vince! - What is it? I don't want any witnesses, get it done! - Will do. Let's go, boys! We'll head back to camp! Looks like trouble, eh? - You're right, my boy. I've got that funny itch again. - Put your guns away. Those are Apaches. Who are you? - Winnetou, chief of the Apaches. I told you so! - What's happened? Silers and his men are chasing us. They've killed three of my brothers. Then we'll give them a whuppin'. - Come on, Billy! Don't let your eyes pop out of your head, Don Juan. Come on, grab this! We'll see something today, Moses. - Good, I could use a change. They're dismounting. Forward! - Follow me! Let's give them some close combat! And you, think before you shoot. You've already missed twice. - Nscho-tschi! Stay here! Fire! Take cover! Get down! We have to get out of here! Move it! Otherwise they'll mow us down like rabbits! What do you say now? - It was about time. I am deeply in your debt. May I know your name? They call him Old Firehand. Old Firehand. The trapper from the mountains. Now I understand. They say you never miss a target. People exaggerate, but it's true. I don't like to waste ammunition. Firehand! If we live, we live for the Lord. If we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Now ride to your tribe and report to Great Bear. Chief, unfortunately we must be on our way. Farewell. No. Nscho-tschi and Winnetou will ride with you into town. We will demand justice there. - You have a good case! Come along. Up to your old tricks, you devil! Must be really hard for poor Vince to deal with a few Redskins. Stop that! Where are the others? - We were ambushed. Where are the others? - Dead, Boss. Next time, you won't get away so lightly. Boss, they've caught Billy-Bob. - What's this? In Miramonte, in German-Joe's Cantina, where we play cards. And booze. - Cut it out! And? Some smartass claimed Billy-Bob pulled an ace from his sleeve. That's when Billy-Bob hit him. And Mendoza then took him in. I'm telling you: misfortune seldom comes in ones, Boss. Anything else? Hey, Pedro! See down there! Go! Halt! Not a very friendly greeting, Caballero. - Where have you come from? Where have you come from? Since you ask so nicely: through the Pass. - Go ahead! I think it better if we do as he says. Hup. Come on, Billy. Quiet! Quiet! Are you cowards or men? Set young Silers free, you've had it! You've all had it! - Listen to Mendoza! Set this Bandit free, and his brother won't spare anyone! - Cut the speeches! Let the guy go! Then we'll have no reason to be afraid of Silers. Be sensible. Listen to me! So long as Billy-Bob Silers is in our hands, his brother will do nothing to us! Freeing him is nuts! - We'll see which of us is right. Watch the strangers. You and you, come with me! I'll be right back. - Come on! Pronto! Glug, glug, glug. - Silencio, Gringo! He murdered my son, I demand he goes to the gallows this very day! What will become of our women and children? He always thinks only of himself, that fool! People speak with the tongues of angels, but nobody wants to listen to an old man. Where did you come from? What do you want? - They were coming through the Pass, Sargento. Who are you? Speak up! - I am Winnetou, chief of the Apaches. And what do you seek here with us? - I seek justice in Miramonte. A certain Silers and his gang ambushed us, and stole our Mustangs and killed 4 of my warriors. We also lost a white friend in this business. He fell in the combat with the Bandits. We demand punishment at any cost. Now you've heard it with your own ears. And I warn you again! If you let this fellow go, you'll pay with your lives! Who knows if this Redskin tells the truth? - I am a witness. That may be. But we have our own problems and must deal with them. Don't think that way. We would have lost the fight against the gang if Firehand hadn't helped us. - You are Old Firehand? I can't deny it. But can you tell me why a town of free citizens needs a guard of soldiers? Painful? - No, not much. Jace! Mon dieu, you'll break your neck! Señora. - You're wounded! Not bad, just a scratch. - We should bandage that immediately. Come with me, my house is just here. - But my brother is in there. He'll be worried about me. - My son will tell him. Go! Charmant, charmant. - Hey! None of them may leave here! - Oh, really? Let's see about that. Come along. That's some woman, eh? How many times do I have to say? We just want peace. And Silers will leave us alone if we release his brother. The murder of my brother should go unpunished? No! As the Bible says: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! - He's right! Come on, men, to the gallows with this reprobate! I'll shoot anyone who takes the law into his own hands! The murderer of your son will go to the gallows, I swear it. But only after a court has ruled. It requires the law, which I represent here! Listen to him. What he says is correct. Murder cannot be atoned by murder. You should remember that. Take the prisoner away. - Si. Your sister is at my house. My mother is dressing her wound. Uncle Leon, you should come as well. - I'll go to her. Yes, go to her. We can achieve nothing here at the moment anyway. Gringo! - Ah! I've had enough of your shenanigans! I want a drink, okay? Put that gun away, you might take someone's eye out. Have you gone crazy? Go on, give it to him! Go on, give it to him! Come on, come on! Hey! I enjoyed that! - Is it over? Double K.O.! They're exhausted. There you go, they both are still alive. - Of course. Weeds don't die easily. Who' s this? - A madman. This is Mr. Robin Eugene Robert Ravenhurst from London. He's going to my mother once again to propose marriage. The 72nd time! Hey. this fight has made me thirsty. Let's have a drink. Agus. Here, dammit! Salut! Truly, you'd never believe that a man who's so great with a knife and shotgun could fail so miserably when he has to use only his fists. I could've broken his neck easy if I'd wanted to! Ouch! Where do you know the Sargento from? - From Taos. There was a sweet little Señorita. And I wanted to give her... Amore! - Stop. I can guess the rest. She was once again the only woman for you and Mendoza stole her away. Ugh! Did you boil a mule in this stuff? Only the best for my dear guests. I'll check on the horses. Come on, come with me, you Don Juan. Haven't I seen you before? - I don't believe so. I'm sure I'd remember you. Maybe you're an apple from a tree I once brushed against. I don't know what you mean. - Never mind. Sit down. What's your name? Jason. But they call me Jace. Who is your father? - I never knew him. He died a long time ago. - And your mother? She's French. She's called Michèle Dorrell. Is she from St. Louis? - Yes, but soon after I was born she moved with Uncle Leon to Miramonte. - I guess you're... 17? I'll be 18 soon. Somebody told me you're a Trapper and live in the mountains. So? - Is that right? Because that's what I want to do. - But your mother is against it, huh? Yes, unfortunately. But my mind's made up. And when I set my mind to something, there's no changing me. - You got that from your mother, hm? What? - Your stubbornness. So, you want to be a Trapper, hm? - Totally. My mother used to say: "Your father was a Trapper. A very good one, in fact." But these days she doesn't want to talk about it. Listen! Run over to your mother and tell her you've just talked to Jason Reed. Reed with double "e". See her reaction! Yes, I'll do that! I'll tell mum right away! Oh, sorry! Well, what's the next step? - Yes, I'd like to know too. One more sip of that stuff and I'd never get out of here. - What? Good job it was just a graze. There. - It'll all be healed in a couple of days. Thank you. - We are grateful to you. Mother! I've something to tell you! - Please don't shout like that! But it's important, listen to me! - Shush! Au revoir, ma petite. Farewell. - Bon voyage. I'll be right back. What happened to your manners? - It doesn't matter. I'm going to the mountains. The newly arrived strangers will take me. - So you want to go to the mountains... and who decided this so easily? - Me! But I was talking to Jason Reed. Reed with double "e". It... it's not forever, mum. And where is... Where is this man who wants to take you away from me? In the Cantina. Cantina. And where does he get the right to decide about you? In the Cantina! Where's he been all these years? When you were born? When I was on the Farm I worked my fingers to the bone to feed you, to clothe you? Where was he then? - How should I know? Oh, what a stupid boy you are! Incroyable! A man from the mountains appears, nobody knows anything about him and bingo, you want to rush off with him. But I decide in this house what goes and what doesn't. And nothing will change, understand? - But mother, I'm almost 18! Please be more respectful when you talk to your mother. You're leaving again? - Yes. And as soon as possible. You know, my mind's made up not to release young Silers. That's regardless of whether I stay here or am forced to leave town. But if we succeed in luring Silers to Miramonte, we have more of a chance. If we joined forces... - This is not our battle, Mendoza! Let him finish. - I wouldn't help him if he was one of the 12 Apostles. - Your big mouth isn't helping. Let him finish. - Gracia, otra vez. You have good weapons. And men with such weapons, they must be good fighters. - Have you considered that it's possible all Miramonte would be dragged in? - It's possible that Silers in his rage would do something that would endanger all Miramonte. I hope he does come here. He won't find any fearful men. The talk earlier was rather different. - Why don't you let the fellow go and see what happens, hm? - It's all that deters him. Once his brother is safe, Silers would ambush us in the Pass and pick us off man by man. - This matter is none of our business, Firehand. It's not our hides that are being tanned here! - Momento. This is not about hides, but about people, Mister. - Mendoza, I'm not bothered when I fight, but I mind very much against whom I fight, and I select them! I'm not so picky. I'll take help from wherever I can find it. What's it say? "This is how every citizen of Miramonte will end up, if my brother's not freed. Silers." Get him down. Come. Now you've seen with your own eyes. You think we have enough men to protect these people from Silers' wrath? - Come. Madame! I would've stayed anyway. - Gracias. What will you do, chief? - We owe you a great deal. My place is at your side. - Thank you. What about you two? - Well... Heads means "go", tails means "stay". Which is it? Come on! Ach! - Come on, again, Tom. What for? We're staying. - We're staying? My money! Give it here! Monsieur, I really don't have time. - Madame, I must speak with you! Oui, Monsieur. - Call me Robin. I beg you, Robin. Oui, Robin. Please, what do you want? - What do I want, Madame? When fever confined me to bed and you saved my life, which is worthless to my family but has some value to me, love awoke in my breast. Not lust, Madame. Oh, lust. Lust. No, genuine love. But Robin, you've told me this... - A hundred times. I know, but at first this was more gratitude. Robin. Your feelings flatter me, but... - Let me speak please, I beg you. An outburst of gratitude is for a Ravenhurst as rare as a genuine emerald ring on the hand of an unworthy. - Monsieur. Pardon: Robin. You forget, I have a son and a brother to take care of. And a heart that beats for you as long as I live. Dearest. And therefore... - You ask for my hand again. Hey! Boss, they're scared out of their wits. That gag was good. - Is that all? Half the town ran for cover when the horse arrived with the dead guard. I bet they'll let Billy-Bob go free! I hope so. Good work, Derks. Hey? Did you hear that? You can take me as your role model. - Get out! Men who throw knives in backs disgust me. To me they are mangy curs. Don't say that, you rat. - It's you who's the rat. You're wrong. Rat is much too tame. You're a cowardly pig! Wirz! Callaghan! Anyone else want more of the same? Which side are you on anyway? - I've been wondering for a while. With Gordon and Ross. Watch out that you don't cross me some day. I asked you to come here because we'll be undisturbed and nobody can overhear. Do you think there are men in Miramonte who might make common cause with Silers? Anything's possible. What's that? - I didn't say anything. - Ah, this is my sister Michèle. She makes the best coffee around. You know my nephew Jace. Oh, pardon me. Thanks. Well, moving on... Looks like we're in this fight whether we like it or not. And there are many reasons to. The only question is what can we do to protect the town from Silers. - This is where we have a problem we can only solve with your help. - What would you suggest? To evacuate here and move the townsfolk to a larger place, one Silers dare not attack. - The people here are poor. Except a few mules and oxen, the land is all they possess. Let's not forget their most precious possession. - What's that? Their lives. - The less one has, the easier to part with it. - Your Plan has much to recommend it. However the people will never leave their homes and move elsewhere. Ask them. They must decide. Quickly. - Come with me, Leon. Your word counts with them. - Okay. Mendoza, send me 2 reliable men, who know the local terrain well. Bueno, I will do so. - Good. We need to think about where to form a defensive perimeter. I'll explore the terrain and get back to you soon. Oh, would you take my... Would you take this young man with you? he could learn much from you. - Gladly. Moment, Monsieur! I'm here too! Just who do you think you are? Now to you, sir. Will you join us? - I've had some experience. Not a whole lot, but a few. - In London? No, in India, as a Lieutenant in the Bengal Lancers. That must have been 30 years ago. - No. More like 29. Good, then go with Caleb and identify which houses observation posts could be set up. - Yes. What? Me go with him? Yes, you go with him. Do you have a rifle? - Indeed. I own several guns. But for the moment this will suffice. - Yes, it's not too bad as a toothpick. For a molar. Forgive me, my dear, but that man was casting doubts on my person. - Did you use that thing in India? No, I acquired this little devilry for fighting in the stupidest place of all, namely the gambling dens of London. Devil, devil. - Off you go. But don't play poker with him, he has an ace up his sleeve - So what? I have two. Oh, Miss Dorrell! Can I have another coffee? Je regrette, there's none left, Monsieur. Oh Pardon, some more coffee? Madame Dorrell. May I speak with you for a moment? Mais oui, Monsieur. - You'll wait outside, of course. I must stay on the ball. I cannot remember an answer from you. - Answer? Sharing your life and estate with me. - The best thing is to wait and see. Who knows if we'll be alive tomorrow? - That's right. Therefore I submit to the demands of the hour. But never forget: in my heart the flame of hope blazes. - Let it blaze. Madame! Enchanting! Er... You know what to do. Take Nscho-tschi with you. - She's a girl. Yes, but 4 eyes see more than two. - She still shouldn't come. Nscho-tschi has learned from her brother how we must help each other. Nscho-tschi knows how to fight. - As you wish. I don't want to hold you back. I'm just opposed to women who confuse a rifle with a cooking pot. Let's go. Can I come in? - Yes. If you wore that strawberry colour that used to drive me so crazy, you wouldn't seem a day older than you were back in St. Louis. I am older. My son proves it. - Hm. A fine lad. Hopefully he'll turn out better than his father. I'm glad we can agree on that. - Just like the old days. Your tongue wounds faster than an Indian's knife. Some women are born with a sharp tongue, others learn it with time. - I didn't know you were expecting a child when I left back then. - You couldn't have known. I didn't want to tie you down, after that quarrel we had. So that's how it was? - Oui. You'd never have been happy in a city. - Have you been happy? Jace is my happiness. And now you come and want to take him away! I promise you, he won't come with me unless you agree. The same as his father, eh? Why are you starting this up again? - We have a son. I have a son! You have your friends, your pelts and your horses. You have your freedom, the prairie and the high mountains. You're a mountain man and not a family man. - I don't know why you're crying. Who's crying? You'd cry too, if you had to slice up onions. I need to check our skins. Come with me if you like. Oh yes, why not? A bear! A bear! Making a little girl shriek is new to me. I can also play a Giraffe. Good, isn't it? You want to go to St. Louis? - Yes. Dealers here only pay one-fifth of the value. - I hope from the bottom of my heart that you get your wish. - We'll get through this. You've had a long day. You must be dead tired. Thanks to you and your friends I'm only tired. And not dead. Your eyes are deep like the sea. I've never seen any so beautiful. What are you doing? If you don't know what a kiss is, then it's time to learn. Just you wait, you little Wildcat. Interesting! A sip of Tequila? - Gracias. Unlock it! There's a horse outside, quick! - My brother won't forget this! Don't worry, he's on our side. I'm just a bystander. I help nobody and hinder nobody. With me everyone's welcome, so long as they pay. I'll bear that in mind. We've freed you to keep the peace here, and not so that you can commit more murders. Get out! Put your hands up! You've gambled away our trump card, Caleb. - Did I shuffle the deck? No! It was Puglia. - Yes. I wanted the man freed, because I saw this as the only way to save the town from Silers! You'll be punished for this, Puglia. - Then you'll need to punish half the town! But there'll be no need now. At sunrise I'm leaving Miramonte and those of you who don't want to die here, come with me! What's the point? Billy-Bob Silers was a very bad man. Billy-Bob Silers did not consecrate his life to the Mother of God, but to sin and to crime. He was wicked. But he was baptised like you, and therefore has to be buried. May the Lord forgive him. You can go now. I'm staying here. You're making a big mistake. Then give us back our rifles. - After what you did? No! Your obstinacy is leading everyone to disaster. You'll see soon enough how stupid it is to resist someone like Silers. My mind is made up. Let's wait and see who's smarter. Yes, let's wait and see. Hasta la vista! - Forward! Greetings, Señores. We come from Miramonte and... No guns, no ammo! - We tried to rescue your brother. That's why they took our rifles. - And? What happened? He... he's dead. He was shot. We risked our lives to save him. And then a Trapper shot him. - It wasn't one of us. It was one of the strangers. - Yes. We could do nothing. We don't want to fight you, this is why we've left Miramonte. We are Amigos. We decide who's an Amigo. In any event, it's not a coward who fears for his puny life. - Amigo! They're returning! Puglia's returning! - What did I tell you? All that excitement for nothing. Puglia's returning. Puglia's returning. - Puglia's returning! I heard, I'm not deaf. My God. Take cover! Back to your houses! Clear the streets! Take cover! Quickly into the church! Hurry! Clear the streets! Come on, move! Oh, my poor child! - You can't stay here! Come! Bring her! Julia! Julia! - Hernando! Come with me, hurry! Let me see my child! Help! Padre mia! My child! Madre mia! Gracias! Muchas gracias! My child! You're alive! Bring some water. Well, does it still hurt? Please. - Muchas gracias. Gracias. Slept through it all, eh, Amigo? - Why didn't Silers attack right away? Because he thought after this attack nobody would be left alive. You're right. We must make preparations. What do you propose? First we must get the people... Well, at least we won't be short of weapons now. Yeah. We must prepare the people for an extended siege. Gentlemen, at your disposal! Where is my Post? I'll give you your assignment. May I borrow your stick? Let's take this as Miramonte. Here is the Cantina, the Kirche, the Mercier house and the shed. From these points we can keep them under fire on all sides. In addition, at each of these sites trenches must be dug at once. - Yes. Digging these is your job. My pleasure, Sir. - Silers will have a clear line of fire. Yes, unfortunately. That's all for now. I'll see you later in the Cantina. Very well. - Mr. Ravenhurst? - Please? Yes, Sir. My reactions are some of the quickest I know. If that's what you wanted to know. - I wanted to know if your fingers are as quick as your tongue. - Like Quicksilver, Sir. Except once, when playing cards, and I had a small mishap. You made a false move and got kicked out of the army, right? A little bluntly expressed, but correct. Although I suppose that it was my destiny. You know your positions. Defence of the church falls to... Caleb. - And Robin Eugene Robert Ravenhurst, with his men? - The shed?... The chief and me. - The Cantina: Mendoza with his men and the rest of the men. The Mercier house: Leon Mercier, Jace and me. Women and children stay in the church. They are your responsibility, Padre. Each position must be supplied with food, ammunition and water. Outposts will be relieved every two hours. That's all. Every minute could decide our fate. Make it only so big that you can reach the right and left edges. Will do. Oh, no, no! Don't! Tha's much too heavy. A splendid lad, our son, isn't he? I have a splendid son! - Oh. I contributed a little, hm? Okay. Oh, du Filou! Good boy! Good boy! So, loaded and primed. - Those things are mighty elegant. Just like women, old pal. The more elegant the package, the more dangerous they are. - And do they fire as well? Oh yes! Last time I fired them I shot a large hole in a small brain. Unfortunately, attached to the small brain was a big Lord. That's why I sought salvation in flight. - You never stop learning, hm? Oh yes, if you meet the right people, yes, dear boy. My Son, not in church! Oh, sorry, Padre. - It wasn't the church it was my shoe. Use the beam. Are you never going to ask how you can help? I have better things to do than take part in your war games. I guess you think only of yourself, hm? What's it to you? - I have something against traitors, German-Joe! And I've something against heroes, Mendoza. What are you doing here? The place for the women is in the church. Oh, you're looking for your brother? He's outside on guard duty. No, I brought you something to eat. - Me? I thought you might be hungry. I must say, I'm speechless. - You want me to go? Hm? Oh, no, no. But don't do this again. Otherwise... I might take liberties again. Like the other day. Get some sleep, I'll stay awake. Pscht. Yes, I can well imagine what you think the life of a Trapper is. Dancing the Fandango every night in Taos with passionate Señoritas and playing cards all the time. - I've no interest in Taos, I want to go into the mountains. Here everything's scorched by the sun. Nothing's green, only rocks and grey Sand. You'll curse the mountains, when you go after beaver in ice-cold water and try to dry out in a freezing wind. The animals smell a fire a mile away. For food often all you have are roots and berries. - Still better than Frijoles any day. And if you get caught in the first snows, there's only leather-sole soup. You can't use a rifle in hunting. Unfriendly Indians might hear you. You have to hunt with bow and arrow. And when you wake up next morning, you're lucky if you still have your horse and your scalp. Then why are you going back to the mountains? - Maybe I'm a little crazy. I think all three of us are. Tom, Caleb. But we're unattached. This must be the reason. We're free as the wind and fleet-footed like the storm. That's exactly it... That's exactly what I want. I want to go where I want and when I want. That's what life means. But it can also mean dying. Have you thought of that? They're coming. Everyone to your Post! I said everyone to their Post! Go! Come on! Forward! Forward, come on! We have to get out of here! Come on! Stand back! Come on, they're covering us! You're injured! - It's nothing! Firehand, our pelts have gone to the devil! Come on, out! Go! Out of here! Rapido! And now for the Cantina! Over to the church! Go, get out of here! Hurry! Hurry! The shed is destroyed, the Cantina blown up, the Mercier house lacks covering fire. We're forced to abandon it and fight from here. Say it openly, I was wrong to desert the Cantina. We lost a barrel of Dynamite, but it's what caused the gang's casualties. That's why Silers broke off the attack. - There are two sides to every story. Yes. But what if he comes back? We cannot, with the best will in the world, fight off another attack. - With the ammunition of the dead Bandits we might hold out a little longer. - In other words: the situation is serious but not hopeless. - It is hopeless, unless we have a miracle. - Dear boy, miracles are faith's most precious child. But they are not mine. Not yet. Where's he going? - Winnetou will bring us help. Why did you order the retreat? We'd sustained many casualties. - Answer my question. Answer me! As you wish. You had disappeared, so I thought you'd been hit. It would suit you if they had hit me. What do you want me to say? - So long as one man's standing in Miramonte, a woman, a living child, there'll be no rest. I will avenge my brother. I swear it. And if you all die, you all die. Two horses are coming! We need to evacuate the house immediately. - Why? Without the covering fire of the shed and Cantina it's untenable if they attack again. Take the stuff over to the church. Rapido! - But what will happen to our property? Only Silers can answer that. - But I must take some things! Only the most valuable, there's no time! - Pack the bandages. Here! - But what's the point of this? We're not going to a Ball. - That dress is coming with us! But mother you heard, only the most valuable! This dress is most valuable to me! - But mother! Be quiet! You're as stubborn as your fa... As who? As your father! Mother! - Careful. I'm completely giddy. You people have a great sense of humour. Unfortunately, I've no time for jokes. Please hear me out. - Who are you? I know this fellow! He's Winnetou, chief of the Apaches. I'll show him what jokes are! - Are you really Winnetou? That's right, Caballero. This man wasn't lying. but hear me out now, before I show what I'm really capable of. Let that man go! So, what is it? - I ask for your help. Indians have never been our friends. - I know. I ask for help not for myself, but for my white brothers. Bandits are attacking Miramonte. - Bandits? Silers and his people. - Is Miramonte suddenly so rich that it interests Silers? - Miramonte's wealth, such as it is, you will find in the church. If you help the citizens of this town, it will not be to your disadvantage. However you must decide immediately. Every minute is precious. - I'll stand by these good citizens. Thank you. May I know who you are? I am Capitano Sanchez Quilvera. - Muchas gracias, Capitano. Not at all, Amigo. You may join my troop. Giddyup! Nscho-tschi. Yes? - Nscho-tschi. A romantic Name... Like the Echo in the mountains. Your skin shimmers like silk. You have the tongue of a devil. And the conscience to boot. Then I must be improving. I used to have no conscience at all. Come. Here, bread. - That's sweet of you. Muchas gracias. Is there anything to drink? - As much as you want. Dear Tom will bring you a keg of beer up to you. - And a horse steak. Extra tender. You must carry out your duties with great precision! Otherwise all my efforts will be in vain. Oh, who's this I see? Madame, let me explain what my work here is doing, This little Trick will surprise our friends. It's not entirely original, but is always effective. Although "a rifle is always a rifle", as Aunt Trudie used to say. Until one day she sent Uncle Aston to the eternal hunting grounds during a duck hunt. It was an accident, or so Aunt Trudie claimed. However afterwards she was not at all the grief-stricken widow. Like in Hamlet. Do you know Hamlet? - Erm... Maybe. When did he come West? - Oh! That hurt. We're in underdeveloped new territory, I forgot. - Hm? Indeed. An innate intelligence. Amazing, the way you cope with your genetic legacy. Fabulous! Amigo, we'v heard about your troubles and have come to offer our help. I am Capitano Sanchez Quilvera. My Caballeros have much experience in capturing towns. Especially if the citizens are of a certain value. There will be much to take, no? - No. A matter of honour? - No, revenge. I see. My brother was thrown in prison for a trifle. Later they murdered him in cold blood. - A disgrace! Trappers happened to be passing through Miramonte. Their weapons caused us losses. We decided to retreat. - But I will not give up. Never! I'm returning to Miramonte. - To turn it into a graveyard. Shut your insolent mouth! - You're the one who'll be in a graveyard! You think anyone else's going to join you? We're not fools to let ourselves be massacred by you. Your brother would have gone to the devil anyway! Anyone else? I see you're a passionate man, Amigo, and we love such men. We will avenge your brother, but on one condition. Which is? You get your revenge, but we get whatever Miramonte has. When do we ride? - Right away! Let's go, Muchachos! Firehand! They're attacking again! Calm down, it'll soon be over. Come back! Come back! - Hey! Padre! Come back! No! Not the Priest! No! - Attack! Back! Everyone back! - We must get out of here! We've got them on the run! Thank heaven! Stay at your Posts for the time being. I don't trust them. I'm sure they'll be back. Take the priest away. Oh! Hey, Amigo! - Hey! It's about time you woke up. I think it's almost our turn. What we're doing is completely idiotic! Riding into a trap with eyes wide open! That we weren't all killed is a miracle! Get off your horses! The church needs hand-to-hand combat to take it. I'm assuming command. This includes your men. - No! No more men will be sacrificed. I'm going to blow the place up! - The church will not be destroyed! Who says so? - Me! This was our agreement. Capitano! What's up with the Dynamentero? Take cover! - Get down! Get down! Something's exploded in the canyon! - What was it? Over there, Explosion! Hold on! - Perhaps it struck the gang. Someone must have helped us! She knows who it was. Ten men stay as guards, the rest come with me. Come on! Stand still! - Come back! Come back! Stay here! Stay here! Here comes your hand-to-hand combat, Quilvera. - Idiot! Take cover right now. Fire on my command. Sargento! Surrender! Your men will be spared! Come out! - Can't be done! The Sargento isn't here right now. He's having his breakfast. You'll have to make do with me. - Ah... El Señor de las Montañas. Very well, command your men to get up. That won't work, they're too tired. - All right, then I'll count to 3. One... two... Pity. You're a brave man. But now... go to hell! Winnetou! Freeze! Hands up! Drop your weapons! Firehand! Tom! Tom! I can't... can't... move. You can't surrender to a bullet. Nscho-tschi. Nscho-tschi, like the Echo in the mountains. We have lost a friend. His death... brings sorrow to our hearts. Give me your bow, chief, a bullet is too good for him. Silers! I'm curious to se how long these gentlemen can maintain this discipline. My record is 6 hours and 55 Minutes. He was a brave Man. A very brave Man. - I would have liked to tell him myself. Buenos días. - Buenos días. Gracias. - That's a wonderful dress you have. Yes. Oh! - The strawberry one. You look 18. - Jason, we have a grown son. Ja, and a fine lad! Now the family is complete. But strictly speaking, perhaps there's one too many. Oh. Who do you mean? - Mr. Ravenhurst. Speak with him. Pourquoi me? - You think I should tell him? Of course it's you who'll tell him! - You'll tell him, let's be clear! I'm not about to! You can... You! General. Monsieur Ravenhurst. - Madame. I... - Go ahead. I was not totally honest with you. - Please, what does this mean? I was never free to respond to your honourable requests. Mr. Jason Reed is... Very good. Continue. How... how can I put it? He is... that is, he was... We have known each other for 18 years and Jace is our son. Oh! I thought... - I'm a widow? I was never married. Never married? You mean to tell me that this enchanting woman lacked the protection of a father? And that you have left this wonderful creature to the vicissitudes of the world? Yes, I guess it came down to that. - Sir! In the absence of the lady's father, I feel it my duty to protest against this 18 year disgrace! I will chastise you now, sir! One, two... No, Robin! I was to blame too. - I am set upon my course. You think I'm merely a wordsmith? One, two, three! Stand still, so I can administer your just punishment! One, two... - Three! Jace, see to this. You can count on me, father. How did I get on this floor? - You slipped. You were approaching my father and stumbled. He tried to catch you, but your chin hit his fist. - Clumsy fellow that I am. I must restore myself. Sincere thanks for your selfless effort. May I return the favour: yours. Can I take this? - I have two more. Father! Is it true you're going to buy a farm when we return to St. Louis and never leave again? Jace, don't tell your mother yet, but maybe you and I will go hunting every now and then. Maybe.
