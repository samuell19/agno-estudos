- Hello. - Hi, Mrs. Singer. - Hi, Cindy. - Is Mike home? Well, he's doing his homework. At least, he better be. I'll get him. She's ready Frank. The wing pitch ought to be perfect. Glen Singer, are you in that barn again? Go ahead you're the oldest. Of course, it's your barn. All right. Meet me at the pasture Frank. Glen! Glen! Is anything broken? Yeah, the wing-struts. Not enough wind. Insane. Frank O'Hearn, I know Glen's crazy but I thought you had more sense. No, Ma'am, I don't. She's right Glen, that was nuts. I'll tell you what you are Glen Singer... ...you are flat out lucky. Lucky, Lucky, get up! No need to get physical. That's my job. You got a run tonight, remember? I never mix business with pleasure. Here I thought, your business was your pleasure. You're in for it now. I'm in for it alright. I'm in all the way. Hey, it's cold in here. I know, that's why I need the blanket. You just scared me to death you know? When? Just now, when I told you how I really feel. Just for one second, I thought you were... ...going to tell me how, you really felt. Well, I'll tell you how I feel there's a line of thunderstorms, ...running to the length of the Rockies, ...and my flight's going to be delayed. Let's go back to bed. Wrong... I called operations 15 minutes ago... ...you go out on time. Oh, and guess who your co-pilot is? Guess. I don't wanna guess. Caston? Not Caston. That guy is so boring. - Not Caston. - Lamort? Is it Lamort? I don't wanna hear anymore about the internet. I hate the internet. - You caught a break, Ace. - Who? What? Hey! Finally! Honey, come on I'll drive. No, I wanna go to my house when we get back tomorrow. Hey come on, they're actually gonna let us fly together. - Don't be mad. - I'm not mad. How long have we been on this ride of ours? Almost a year. I love the ride, Lucky. I've just reached the point... ...where I wanna know we're going somewhere. We are going somewhere, Dallas. Hilarious. Does Letterman know about you? Connie come on. We have the whole trip to talk about it. Come on. Okay. So how'd you pull it off? - Luck of the draw. - Yeah. Some draw for a pilot with two years... ...in the right seat. Two years and three months, thank you. Look you're a terrific pilot, and you've got... ...zilch for seniority. What'd you do? Buy Bouchard a box of candy? We have 600 co-pilots, maybe it was just the odds. Yeah, right. George Bouchard and I, are strictly business. You know that. I know that, does he? Don't make this about me. He just wants you to fly his way. Look, it is about you. And I don't fly a glass cock-pit. I actually work the flaps. If you think I would take advantage of a very old... ...very dead relationship with the chief of pilots... ...just for the chance to fly with... He cut a deal. I fly with you tonight and... And? So does he. Oh, no Connie. He said you're due for a check ride. Oh, come on. Check ride? With Darth Vader? Bye-bye honey. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you. Wave bye-bye to Mommy. Don't let him talk you in to sugar, Mark. Adam, don't open the... My bone! Are you okay? All right. Bone lives. You know what this is about? They're rating every pilot. If there's a takeover thing... Not if, when. Takeover is going to happen and when it does, I'm out. Not a chance, you're the best they have got. Just play their game. Is that what you think I should do? What if they lay you off? Then Bouchard will have you all to himself. I am serious, what will you do? I can always go back to flying the pipe-line in Alaska. I'll find something. And what will I do? They're not gonna lay off a woman-pilot. It looks too good on their diversified employee record. I'm nobody's token, Lucky. Flight 756 Non-stop service... - Is there a meal Ms. Dupree? - Yeah, in the barf bag, Tasha. Settle down Freddie. Hi, we're the Waters Elementary band group. Is Flight 19 on time? Yes, ma'am. You've got yourself quite a platoon there. Yeah, but they've got me. Our principal offered to come along. Maybe I should have taken her up. Stop pushing. Freddie, stop pushing. You'll fly with the baggage, I swear. That's exactly where you belong. Mom, I have to go to the bathroom. Again? Go tell your father. It's his first flight. And the band's first competition... And I thought I was having a bad day. Woah! Where are you headed with this? - We're going to Dallas. - Yeah? Us too. - Are you the pilot? - Both of us. I got a good idea for you. Tell the lady at the counter, you want special handling... ...for that cymbal. We'll put it someplace where it won't get bent. Special handling? Cool. See you on board. Did I tell you I know the pilots? Full tank, Captain. Oil's fine too. Thanks, Harlan. Gee, Lucky, I never thought of that. Oil your pencil. Do they write faster that way? Evening, George. Could be. You might wanna use this to grade my flight tonight. I assume you're gonna be doing a lot of writing. Oh, no thanks. I got three pens of my own for this trip. Incidentally, my ship has dedicated instruments to... ...read oil pressure. You might wanna copy that in your log. It's not your ship, it's my ship. And I don't trust instruments. They break. She's a brand new Gallant 270. She cost $60 million and at that price nothing breaks. No kidding? I guess Southeast Air is gonna get a refund on their 270... ...that went down in Anchorage. Have a good flight, Sir. - Hey Captain. - Hi. - Your seat Sir. - Thank You. Where do I find a flight plan? It's around the corner, Sir. You're headed North, there's rain. I got $77,000 worth of instruments. Weather's not a problem. Credit card is my log book. Top me off okay? I'm going for coffee. $77,000 worth of instruments and and a whopping two hundred hours of flight time. Swell. My brother-in-law extended his visit, Juan. So don't add to my misery. No way, we're having a great day Boss. We closed 9 right to fix the runway lights. Better get some cars over there to help out with the traffic. We got three out there now. Don't get too far ahead, or you'll have my job. Who the hell wants your job? Good evening, Carl. Good game today? We lost. I went 0 for 4. Ah, well there is always tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow we'll probably go 0 for 5. Tango. Alpha. Foxtrot. Four. Two. Eight. - Hey, Connie. - Hi, George. Oh, you do wonders for that uniform. Thank You. You know, I remember the first time you were in that seat. You were very nervous. And you helped me a lot. I'll always be grateful. Oh, grateful. Aren't we passed grateful, you and me? Oh, George, we've talked about this. I made a mistake, I never should have... But you should have. I'm sorry. You just got me at a weak moment. I was, mad at... Someone else, and... you were there. Someone else? You know he's still pulling the pencil routine of his. It's his way of being thorough. Thorough? What sort of a pilot do you know... ...who uses a pencil to measure oil on a Gallant 270? He carries a tire gauge to check the air pressure. Next thing you're gonna know he's gonna break into the Texaco jingle, right in front of the passengers. Well, at least they'll know they're in good hands... No, no, no, they will think they are in good hands. Connie... John Wayne is dead. You got to get past this guy. You got too good a future. You're right. Lucky's old-fashioned... Compulsive, stubborn... trouble is, I like that in a man. Lucky, I... I want you to fly by the wire tonight. Peter Pan flies by wire. Well then... Seriously, it's computer's night. Is the rumor I heard true George? What rumor? I heard you're gonna eliminate Connie's position. What? Eliminate the first officer? That's what I heard. Heard you're gonna put a German shepherd in the right seat. Really? Yeah, the dogs aren't going to actually fly the plane... they're just going to bite the pilot every time he reaches for the controls. Very funny. Fly the box tonight. I can fly the computer, George. I can also fly the airplane, which is what I prefer. Listen, we want you and all... the other pilots to stay to the order. Yeah, but what you get are pilots who are bored to death. That's what causes pilot error. No, pilots cause pilot error. And they fail four times more often than the system. Then give them a reason to stay awake. Let their gut do some work. The people in the back seats wanna know... that a human being is in-charge. Look, Lucky, I want it auto-flight tonight. What happened to you George? You used to be a flier, not Bill Gates. I grew up. I joined Management and I left barn storming to history. Now fly by the wire. Look, why don't we drop the pre-tense here alright? Lucky. This airline is being downsized... and you'd love to see me go so why don't you write all the red marks you want on that chart? But, I'm flying the damn airplane, okay? Lucky, Lucky, Lucky... What happened to your ambition? You're gonna spend the rest of your life in a cock-pit? God, I hope so. You just gave him permission to lay you off. Oh, he doesn't need my permission. And you don't give a damn. What do you want me to do? How about join the real world? Toe the line for once like the rest of us, accept some responsibility, shall I go on? I don't understand the problem... Let me spell it out for you. I am tired of, how did you say it, "staying awake "and letting my gut do the work in this relationship..." because if we have a future... I don't like the direction. Connie, the last time I planned a future... ...it cost me a lot. A lot of pain, a lot of sleep... ...a lot of alimony. I am not much good at futures. Well, then I'll quit worrying about it. All right, let's go to Dallas. Number 9748 Charlie. Clouds at 6000. Winds five to ten, gusting to 20. There's an icy level at 7000 feet. Roger dispatch. I can take this. We're certified. I'm sure you are, Sir. I'm just reporting conditions. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am Jill Zimmer, your chief flight-attendant. We'll be underway shortly on Quest Airline's beautiful new Gallant 270 aircraft. Please make sure all carry-on's are safely stowed in the over-head bin or under the seat... in front of you. Thank you. Or if you have any questions... one of our cabin crew will be... happy to assist you. Stop it. And that you have a safe, happy flight. Adam, don't stare. - Can I help? - No. They cram so many seats into these planes nowadays... and it flies a lot of people but they sure don't care about passenger comfort. I remember the last time, that I flew... Please Ma'am... Oh, you can call me Patty. Patty. I'll tell you about my last trip... I sat there, minding my own business... didn't hear one word from my seat-mate about their job... their destination or their family. You know what? It was perfect. I'm Mr. Cotts, my office reserved a new a... what do you call it, a flying conference room? Uh, yes Sir. Mr. Cotts we have your reservation... but you have to seat in your seat for takeoff. Oh, look the seat's here have seat belts... I got a bitch of a schedule... How about you relax the regulations just this once? No. Like you people care. November. Nine. Seven. Four. Eight. Charlie. Requesting intersection departure. Intersection departure approved. Winds fly to 15. Taxi to position Bravo, intersection runway 911. Roger, nine left. Control. Quest 19 heavy at Gate 10. Request push-back. Roger Quest 19 heavy cleared to push from Gate 10. I made reservations for you at the Coach House for Thursday. No, no, no, Sharon I can't stay at the Coach House at Squall Valley. It doesn't have a gym. How many times do I have to tell you? Book me at the Regent. Okay I'll call the Regent but the last time you stayed there you said you hated the concierge and to never book you there again. So I thought at least at the Coach House they had... Push 19. Clear for taxi. Cross 19 heavy. I got my N9748 Charlie pulling at intersection for clearance. November, 9748, Charlie, hold at intersection for heavy jet, Freedom 86 Control. 9748 Charlie, I don't see any traffic to my left. Here you go. Freedom 86, Clear to take off. Freedom 86 Rolling. Thank You Sir. Quest-19, have you pulled short of nine left? Quest-19 heavy. November-9-7-4-8-Charlie. Prepare for takeoff middle section. Roger. Rolling. Ground four and eight. Yep, go ahead. What the hell are you guys doing, opening nine right? I'm not even off the strip yet. What? Let me locate the supervisor. Quest-19 heavy, cleared for takeoff. Quest-19 heavy, rolling. This is cool. Tighten your seat belt. Right. Set thrust. Set. 80 knots. No flags. 100. 120. V, one, rotate. November-9-7-4-8-Charlie, turn right. Heading 0-4-0. Roger that. Turning right 0-4-0. Quest-19 turn right immediately. Quest-19, right turn. What the hell is he doing? Wait, 48 Charlie, turn right immediately. - Warn. Warn. - Climbing. - Again, turn right immediately. - Right turn. Right turn. My head! Good god. What was that? It's a bomb. Quest-19, what is your status? Full power. Climb rate? 2900 feet per minute. Leveling. No change. Nose up. Quest-19, what is your status? Please acknowledge. No change. We'll be fine. We'll be just fine. Hang on to me. I want my mom. Everyone listen up. The pilot will tell us what happened. Until then, I want each of you to take your neighbor's hand. - Breathe. - Help. - What was that? - We've been hit. Hit? What do you mean, hit? I know the feeling, okay? We've been hit. Deselect hydraulic number one. Quest-19, what is your status? Deselect number two. Damn. Banking right. Banking left. It's turning. Get on the pedals with me. Left first. And now. - Nothing. - Right full pedal, now. Nothing. Quest-19, I observe an erratic flight path. Please pass any request to us. Trim. Nothing. Quest 19, what is your status? Please acknowledge. I don't have time to explain. Standby. Pull back to 1-4-0-9. We are going down a knot. We're going to stall. Maximum thrust. Steady at 1-4-5. Put it back after 1-5-0 knots and turn off those damn alarms. Start. Hydraulics. - Normal all systems. - Check the back. - Rear cabin. - Everybody in one piece back there. Shaken up, but secure. What happened? We don't know yet. Any damages? Just food spilled everywhere. Structural damage? It's hard to tell. There's no holes, that I can see. Look, I want everybody in their seats. I want everybody strapped in. Okay. Ladies and gentleman. I've just spoken with the captain. At this time, we recommend that you stay securely fastened with your seatbelts. Control, this is Quest-19. I have no response on our pitch or yaw. Eight alarms are working. Below 1-5-0 knots. I've stall warnings, and heavy vibrations. I've marginal control over altitude. We can only climb. I can't get the nose down. Repeat. I cannot get the nose down. I am guessing that our elevators are jammed in the up angle. All we can do at the moment is maintaining climb in nearly full throttle. We have 290 souls on board. Weighing more than 500,000 pounds. Quest-19, this is Jack Eberly, Airfield Manager. Captain, we are getting reports of a light aircraft break up in your space. Presume a possible collision. We'll standby for you. Feel free to brainstorm. You said that you knew the feeling of being hit. Is that how you got hurt? Yes. What else do you want to know? My social security number, my blood type. It's A+. Remember it. You may be asked. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Captain. I understand your concern. Please stay calm. The impact you felt was from contact with smaller aircraft. We have damage, but don't worry. We are solidly in the air. Just sit in your seat with your seatbelt fastened, and I'll get back to you in a minute with an update. We'll try to have you all home for dinner. They'll be home all right. They'll be home the hard way. Knock it off Bouchard. We'll get out of this Connie. Just need a minute to think it through. You can think it till you are blue in the face. But there's nobody in this cockpit who is trained to bring down a crippled aircraft. Lucky, we are ascending at 300 feet-per-minute. At that rate, we're going to climb right out of the density that keeps this plane up. And then I guarantee you we're going to go into a spin that you are not going to be able to correct. - I'm aware of that. - We are burning fuel like a bonfire. If you have to keep these turbines in sustained over speed - they're going to blow apart. - So, you passed physics. Is that what you want me to tell the passengers, that the computer failed? - It's up to us now. - Shut the hell up you two. We have enough problems without you turning this into a cockfight! He's right, Lucky. We need help. Take the wheel. Control, I want a full patch with the following people ASAP. Chief Engineer at Gallant aircraft. They're in Connecticut. Lieutenant Colonel Frank O'Hearn at Malcolm Air Force space, in Idaho. - Hurry it up. We're burning fuel like... - Call this in now. Roger. Working on it. What is your fuel endurance, Captain? Stand by. Way we're going, we figure we'll be dry at 0-5-2-5-Zulu. 2 hours and 25 minutes to a flame out. Roger that. The airport is clear. All flights diverted. Captain, you have our full attention. Suggest you spiral as you climb and stay in our airspace. Roger. Beginning a five mile turn. Why yeah. That'd be a good idea. Also I'd like to add Bakersfield. Mr. Pryce. There's an emergency call for you. Actually they...they asked for the Chief Engineer, but I thought... What is it Margaret? A 270 has been involved in a mid-air collision. By God. Another? Assemble the crash team. - The plane's still in the air sir. - Get them. Colonel, telephone. I'll be right back. Colonel Frank O'Hearn here. Captain Singer, we have the three-way hookup now. We've briefed them on your situation. - Frank, you on? - Yeah, Lucky, it's me. I figured the next time I heard from you it'd be over a beer. I owe you one, Frank. Gallant? This is Ian Pryce, Chairman of Gallant aviation, speaking from Bristol, Connecticut. At my side is the Chief Engineer and designer of the Gallant 270, Henry Gibbons. All right. This is Captain Lucky Singer. My first officer is Connie Phipps. Captain George Bouchard is in the jump seat. Patched in from Idaho is Lieutenant Colonel Frank O'Hearn. An old friend of mine. The best flier I've ever known. We're now passing through 8700 ft. At 1-5-0 knots, at nearly full power. Visibility, one-half mile. All we can do is climb. At the current burn rate we will be out of fuel in 2 hours and 10 minutes. Turbine temps are rising fast, so we are in danger of blowing up the engines. I need all the ideas you've got. I need them now. Or everybody on this airplane has got a big problem. Come on, baby. Passing through 9,000 ft. Let me tell you gentlemen a story. It was once a flight with 90 coin collectors on board. Sitting way in the back. When the plane took off - I like a good story as much as the next man, Captain, but right now we want to track your fuel displacement. Well, let me finish. When the plane took off, the nose popped up. It just wouldn't handle right at all. So, the pilot turned around and landed. But he couldn't find anything wrong. 'Till he realized that every one of those coin collector fellows was carrying over 60 pounds of precious coins in their carry-ons. This is fascinating, Lucky. Do I have time for a smoke? Mike, Frank, listen. That's over 5,000 pounds of unreported weight in the tail of the airplane. It upset the center of gravity. Once they spread those collectors up, the plane took off fine. Captain, unless there's a point to this... We've got to do the same thing. We got to get everything heavy, forward. I got to get the nose down, otherwise we're going to keep climbing until this plane vaporizes. How? Air to air transfer. Heavy tools and saws. We cut up gallies, the seats, anything heavy, and move it forward along with the passengers. Did you say an air to air transfer? Roger. We don't have the necessary tools on board. But, you can't open a door in a 270 in flight. Nope. We're going to have to pop the emergency hatch here in the cockpit. It's the craziest idea I've heard of since the barn back in Kansas. It'll work in theory. - Hell I like it. - Let's hope it adds up. All you people work on it. I'm going to move my passengers forward and check on the damage. Lucky, what are you going to tell them? Right now, as little as possible. Bring in heavy equipment through the escape hatchet at 10,000 feet? Don't you think this is maybe just a little impractical? An air to air transfer with a passenger jet. Never been attempted. Even if we knew how to do it. Which we don't. There isn't enough time. Where will they cut? Does this pilot think he's a structural engineer? Well, what's our idea? We don't have one, yet. But the answer is not going to come from this guy. He's not a tactician. He's a cowboy. Maybe. But, he's our cowboy now. - God, it's Anchorage all over again. - No. Sir, with all respect. Anchorage was never proven to be a design flaw. - Not yet. - It won't be. And clearly neither is this. Forget the pilot. If we have to rewrite the book, it has to come from us. Well, I suggest you find a pen, and start writing now. Yes, Sir. Get me P. R. We're just gonna take a look, we're under control. Everything's fine. Captain? I'm traveling with 10 children that are not my own. What shall I tell them? What have you told them so far? To try and stay calm. To listen to what the captain said. To have faith. Well, ma'am, I'd say just trust in yourself. Because that's the right thing to do. - What's your name? - Crystal. This is my son, Adam. Hey, Adam. What's your mom tell you to do when you are in a tight spot? Pray. That's good. You know what I do? I go to work. So, what do you say, we both do our thing and... ...I'm sure it'll be fine. Captain, can you tell us anything, Sir? I'm telling you. I'm standing on nine right. And the guy buzzes me at 100 ft. It came out of the Romeo intersection. Had to. If you guys really think this runway is closed, someone's way screwed up. Son of a bitch! That idiot took off from nine right. Nobody in this tower knew that plane was on nine right, did they? Because if they did, I want to know about it now. He was my blip, Jack. He requested an intersection departure and I cleared it. I never said right. Jack, I didn't mean right, and I never said right. All right, then that's it. Joy, give Carl a break. Carl, it could happen to any of us aside. You all right? All right listen up. Move everyone as far forward as possible. Fill any empty seats. Excuse me Sir. The Captain needs all the passengers to move forward. - What's the projection? - I've estimated the structural damage - and put into the program. - Let me see it. Run it. - Cockpit. - Connie. Pull back on the throttles a bit. Okay. Put it back where it was. What is it? I'll be right up. Start over. Program in a radical change in the center of gravity to mimic a massive shift in the load weight forward. Say, 10,000 pounds. The power is pushing us one way. The drag on the tail pulling the other. This airplane is coming apart. We'll be ripped in half. - Excuse me, Captain? - You should stay in your seat, Sir. Listen, I got my crew on board. There's three of us, we're all riggers down from Canada. These boys know how to take care of themselves. Anything they can do to help? - Maybe, what's your name? - Tim. Tim, there's another one of these in the rear galley. - Get your men and meet me there. - Right. My, what big eyes you have grandma! And the wolf said all the better to see you with. There are reports of a possible mid-air collision. Witnesses say that parts of a private aircraft fell from sky less than an hour ago. And officials believe a second plane, Quest Airlines flight 19, was involved in the incident and is still in the air. The question seems to be, "For how long?" Let's go boys, Captain needs our help. All right - Now this paneling is cosmetic, but underneath there are hydraulic lines running horizontally. So, we have to be careful. Here we go! Keep the weight under 100 pounds and bring everything that will cut, bend or shred. On a double gentlemen your grandmother could be on that airplane. Let me take a look. - Damn. - She's buckling. Captain! Sir, I've got to get to the cockpit. We're under control. Excuse me, Captain! Don't give me that. You can check squadron. - Wait a minute. - Please! Please! What I want to know is, what is an army helicopter with a 30mm chain gun doing on our left way? - What's your name? - Duke Houston. Excuse me, Mr. Houston. I'll check it out. Are we gonna crash? Yeah, I'd say there's a very good chance of that. - Cockpit. - Connie pass me through to control. Well, that's not very fair, you know. I've been dead for ten years, I just divorced and now I have to die for real? Not fair. I know about carrying dead weight. That's not fair, that's for sure. Quest 19, this is Jack Eberly - What the hell are you guys doing? You put another aircraft into this space, our turbines blow, and we take 'em down with us. The military wants to help, That helicopter is the closest ship to you. It's pretty dark, but they could try to assess any damage they could see. - All right, all right. Give us the report. - Roger. - You said a chain gun right? - That's right. - How come you know so much about a 30mm? - I flew choppers in Vietnam. What I'm going to say has to stay between us right now. This is Patty, she's all right. - Miss. - Sir. Hear me out Duke, this ship is coming apart. The collision jammed the elevators in a full up-pitch angle. - That means we can only... - Means you can only climb. Right. And the drag, in the tail is pulling her apart. How big a hole would a 30mm put in our covering? The size of your fist. Do you think that pilot could shoot some holes in our outboard flippers? Reduce the drag, slow the turbines, maybe... Maybe even bring the nose down. What do you think? I think if he's got the ammo, we shoot some more holes in this aircraft. Lucky, we have company. Quest 19 to army chopper, this is Captain Singer. Do you read? -5-5-5 Quest 19. - Do you have any live ammo onboard? That's affirmative, Sir! They pulled us off an exercise for this. Do you know what I mean when I refer to our elevators? I'm fully qualified to fix wings, Sir. And from what I can see your flippers are locked in the up. You figured. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to shoot some holes through our elevators. but you've got to do it without hitting our trim tabs. I might need 'em later. - Stand by. - Shoot at our tail? My god, Singer. Lucky? We've got to reduce the drag, or the turbines are going to blow up any minute. Yeah, but what if he misses, what if he hits the fuel tank? George, go ahead and calculate the odds, but it's my call and I'm making it. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. If you look out the left side of the plane, you'll see a military helicopter. Do not be alarmed. I'm going to coordinate an unusual maneuver with this aircraft. I'm going to ask him to create some holes in the tip of our plane, by shooting his guns. - Holes? - Once we reduce the drag in this way, we'll be one step closer to home. Give your seat belts and extra tug, and hang on. - Quest 19, clear to shoot. - Quest 19, fire at will. Never say never, huh? Okay, here we go, folks. Brace yourselves. It's okay, you'll be all right. - Captain. - Fire! We have a fire in the galley. Standby. We've got a fire, hit the douser. - It's not stopping, Lucky! - All right, stay back. Lucky, this thing is growing fast. The galley is going. Stand by, keep reporting to me. It's not going out. What the hell is going on? The flame retardant must be flowing out the tail. That means there's a leak! Sucking it outside, instead of to the fire. - It's not stopping, Lucky! - Okay, we are hitting the second bottle! Hit the other bottle. It's okay everybody. - Where's your hand extinguisher? - It's right up there. The fire is out Lucky. The fire is out. - Fire is out. - Oh, thank God. What's that smell? Pasta primavera. You're standing in dinner. Folks, this is the Captain. The fire is out, I repeat, the fire is out. - Lucky, look at the air speed! -25. - Yeah, the nose. - Down five degrees! Yeah mamma, yes! The climb rate is down to 100 feet per minute. Okay, pull slowly back on the throttle. 'Till you get a stick shake, then bump it up a bit. RPM's down. That's good. Well, Gallant, we got the nose down some. What have you got? Bad news Captain, the computer model shows that your weight transfer plan won't work. Well, I suggest you stop telling us what won't work ...and come up with something that will dammit, and quick! Hello folks, you probably felt our nose come down some. - We're looking better every minute. - We're still headed up. So don't change your plans for that dinner. I'll keep you updated. He's the pilot, what's he gonna do? Tell us the truth? It's now or never. What? I'm going to the washroom. Well, his kidneys are working, gives me hope for his brain. How'd you get yourself into this one, hot shot? You know what you are? You are lucky! Bouchard, help me get this hatch open. - You're going down the oxygen hold? - Yeah. - What are you going to do? - Unlock the seal of the rear wheel. - Rear wheel? - There's nothing wrong with the nose gear. Yes! What? Contol, I've got an idea how to get us out of this! - Is everybody on, Pryce? - We're here, Captain Singer. Pryce? Yeah, I'm here Lucky, ten minutes to take off. - On my way to you. - No, hold on. Listen! There was something fundamental missing from my center gravity idea. Simplicity, now listen to this: the wheel well on this bird is basically airtight. Especially at this altitude. Now here's what we do. We fill your tanker with water. We make an air-to-air transfer of water to fill the nose compartment. The weight will bring the nose down without compromising the structure of the aircraft. We'll have to purge the fuel from two tanks to pick up water, but it might work. Damn right it will! Bring the hose from the hatch here in the cock-pit down to the wheel well. It's a routine air force air-to-air refilling mission, - only with water. - One problem captain. If the nose does come down when you try to land, you wont be able to bring it back up. - You will plough right into the runway! - That's the beauty of it! We wait to the last second to bring the nose gear down, the doors open, the water spills out, the nose flares, bingo! Perfect landing! - Hell with it, it'll work! - Your timing will have to be perfect. This is not the time to question my flying abilities, Mr. Pryce. No, No, Captain, I don't mean to offend. Don't worry Mr. Pryce, there's no known way to insult Captain Singer! Gibbons here, what altitude you are at right now? We're passing 22,000 There is very little pressure outside, by the time we set this up. you're gonna be even higher. When you blow that emergency hatch up above your head it will be about 30 below up there A 100 knot wind is gonna cut through plane like a knife you'll freeze to death inside two minutes. Arctic suits. Standard air-force issue. You got any, Frank? I can help you out of mothballs in five minutes. Okay, can you attach the suits with the hose to your solid boom? Fly it to us in the same pass. Maybe, I'll have to have to defeat the fuel boom interlock, but if I rig a little drogue shoot on the end of the water hose, she might just fly. What about oxygen? Will you have enough? The supply is only meant to last till a pilot can dive below 12,000 a minute or so. But it will take you several minutes to do all this. Look, I can't solve all the problems, what the heck you guys do? Work on it. In the meantime let's get the tanker rig in the air. - What do you say, Frank? - I'm on my way I'm concerned about their altitude. 220 people needs a lot of oxygen. Get busy figuring out how much and how fast. Folks this is the captain. We are working out a landing plan now with the airport. We're going to dim the lights now in the cabin to help everyone relax I'll get back to you. Larry, we're told it is this front landing gear well that they hope to fill with 12,000 pounds of water which will in turn bring down the nose of the disabled airliner. Of course, they're doing all this at 180 mile per hour, at nearly 28,000 feet in the air, and with over 200 people on board. Excuse me. Stewardess? - Will this work? - You bet. - Money in the bank. - Lucky? Answer my question. I don't know, Connie. We better believe it will. With every bone our body, or we don't stand a chance. - Where's Connie? - She's in the oxygen hold. She wanted to study the controls and the distances for the rendezvous. She's a hell of a pilot. You got yourself a keeper there, Lucky Yeah. I hope they remember to clip the brass connector off the hose. - Connie. - What is it? There are 200 people up there depending on me. My whole life has been about protecting them. I know that. Maybe that's why I've trained myself to back off. Not to let anything personal get in the way of work. What are you saying? I love you, Connie! I haven't said it till now, I'm a fool. There's so much going on, if we get down. No, no, no, listen there's a catch. I've got to put you in real danger now. I want you to fly the airplane during the transfer. Is that what this is about? I can fly the damn plane, Captain, you don't have to... Wait. - ...have to bribe... - I'm not bribing you! - You could die. - We could all die! I need you to fly the plane while I get the arctic suits into the cockpit. I could get Bouchard to do it but, I need a flyer down here, someone who knows his way around. Who can handle the water hose. I've got to put you in that seat unprotected. The cold will be monstrous. We're gonna get down. But you could die, do you understand? I don't want to do this, but I have no choice. I understand. I'll handle it. Now you tell me, I just leased an apartment. We've run and rerun the calculations, it is what it is. There just isn't enough oxygen supply on board to keep 220 passengers and crew conscious for the time it will take to transfer the equipment and water. Why not? We can't be expected to design for every fancy accident in the Universe, sir. No, Mr. Gibbons, just real accidents. Please, God, tell me you have a solution. The oxygen flow is regulated by directional valves in the hold below the cockpit. It can be directed to certain parts of the passenger cabin, all to the front cabin - or all to the rear. - The oxygen can be directed? Yes, to make it last longer in one area. Because once they depressurize by the time the pilots do all their work and dive to 12,000 feet, where they can breathe. The oxygen for 220 people will have run out. We could however sustain approximately 180 people during that time. Are you suggesting I move 40 people to the rear cabin and cut off their oxygen supply? 40 people are going to suffer from lack of oxygen one way or another. Some may die, yes. And you want me to pick the people who will die? It's going to be hell up there freezing cold, powerful winds and probably a controlled crash landing at best. - The old and the weak will not be... - This is a decision for the Captain to make, he is ultimately responsible for those people. For God's sakes you can't burden him with this now! He has enough to do. So you want me to play God? Someone has to. The tanker will trail a net with the arctic gear. Frank will dangle the net above the cockpit. When it's in place, I'll pop the hatch. When that happens the force of the wind and the drop in the pressure will be so great that you guys will have to fight your way in here. We'll have 1 minute to get the net into the hatch unload, get the suits on, before we get frostbite or worse. -1 minute? -1 minute. Fortunately we will have 2 bottle of O2 for all of us. During that minute, Connie will fly the plane. So the priority is to get me into a suit and flying the plane. So you can yank her out of the seat and get her into a suit. Otherwise she will freeze to death. Alright, here's the drill. I will direct the tanker into position. The tanker will thread the hose through the hatch. You gentlemen will take it and guide it into the hole where Captain Bouchard will offload the water. Once the water is offloaded, I want you to get the hell out of the cockpit because when the tanker pulls the hose out of the plane it's going to fly around like a steel snake. It will take a swipe at everything in its path. Now Connie and I can control the plane, but once I blow the hatch, I can't repressurize. There's a limited amount of oxygen. So I have to get the plane down quickly. Otherwise, we're all going to die anyway. Any questions? Alright, let's go aft. Once I've talked to the passengers explained what's going to happen, smile, make it sound like a piece of cake. C'mon, smile! Let's do it. I'll clear a path. Hey, George? Listen, umm netting that hose is going to be a bitch. If you want I could get one of the riggers to do it. No, I'll do it. Flying by your gut, huh? Yeah. - Quest 19? - This is Quest 19, go ahead. This is chief engineer Gibbons. In order to ensure the oxygen supply to both cabins, you have to open the directional valve. Directional valve, where is that? Below, in the oxygen hold there's an orange lever marked "Aft cabin". - Pull it to the far left. - Far left. And may I suggest, that you move the old and weaker passengers to the rear cabin? The cold and force of the wind will be minimized there. Good Idea, we're on it. George? Yes? Gallon aviation says to move the orange lever marked, "Aft Cabin" to the far left to open the flow of oxygen to both cabins. Alright, far left, affirmative. When the masks come down, put them over your nose and mouth and breathe normally. If you have a sweater or a jacket, I suggest, you put it on now. Captain? First officer. Yea, Connie? Gallon, suggests we put the older and weaker... ...passengers in the aft cabin. Should be less wind and cold. Fine. - Hey, Lucky? - What? Let's move the children too, with their parents. - Good idea. - Will the weight matter? Some but it's not worth the risk freezing some kid's feet. I'll take care of it. Alright, we'd like the children and the seniors to move to the back of the airplane it'll be much warmer there. Keep your partner's hand, no shoving, no running. Captain, the first officer says, the tanker is two minutes out and closing. On my way. Ma'am? Here, I can help you with that ma'am. About time Air Force, never can find a waiter when you need one. Yeah, there was a backup at the bar, I hear you need a drink. Yep, about 4000 gallons. - Is that with an olive or without? - No olive. Not shaken. Not stirred. - Releasing the valve. - Make it quick! - Connie, fuel time? - About 30 minutes left. - Altitude? - Approaching 27,000. I'm gonna have to drop this thing like a stone. C'mon baby, try for papa, try for papa! All right, Lucky, I've dropped. Captain Singer, have the older passengers been moved to the aft cabin? Stay off the radio. They must be moved, Sir. Yes, they've been moved, stay off the radio. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Singer I'm now going to drop the overhead oxygen masks. Slip them on as the cabin attendants have instructed and breathe easy. We're doing fine. Okay, Frank, ease her down. That's good, you're okay. Keep your speed right there, Lucky, hold her steady. Lucky? Something's wrong. What? Gallant sent me down here to change the flow of oxygen to both cabins. So what? He had me move the aft cabin lever to the left. The hell you talking about? Think about it, the valve should already be open to the whole plane. It would only need to be changed to close the flow of oxygen, not to open it. But there are passengers back there, children, why would we cut the flow? Why would we...? ...Oh my God, they're going to sacrifice those people. What? The lever closes the valve, it doesn't open it! Pryce tell me I'm hearing this wrong. Tell me, you bastard, you're not sacrificing a single person on this plane! The computers say we can't sustain everyone to the 12,000 foot level, Captain. There isn't enough oxygen for everyone. We had to choose. We've done the responsible thing. Like hell you have! You have no idea how fast I'll get this plane down. There's no possible way for you to know how thin the air will be from this moment on. 'Cause it's in my hands, they're my passengers! And I'm not going to let them die, do you read me? I read you loud and clear, Captain. Bouchard, turn that valve back. Oxygen open, Lucky. Thanks, George. Hey Frank, ease it back two degrees. Two degrees. Hold that altitude. Ease back on the power, we'll hold steady. - Steady! - Too fast Frank! It's okay, it's okay. It's on screen. Hang on, folks. Decompression is coming in a few seconds. Tim, you ready? Almost. Set! Ready? Now! C'mon! Grab it! Get him out, get him out. C'mon, reel it in or you'll be colder than the Mayor's ass in Idaho. Pull on the hose. Grab it! I got it! They have less than 30 seconds to get those suits on or they will begin to freeze. And if the body becomes dysfunctional from the cold of course. We're being told that there's little chance of survival. Connie! Connie! I can't get her up! Connie? Connie? Is she all right? Tanker, what's happening with the hose? We're fighting a head wind Lucky, just hold on. - Lucky! Lucky! - Force back, force back. C'mon! That's good, keep it coming. C'mon! - Now! - Now! Water, water, water. - How much passenger oxygen is left? - Six minutes. The water should be flowing into the wheel well at the rate of 500 gallons a minute. If the extra weight doesn't force the nose down. - She okay? - She ain't moving. I'm fine. Where's the cockpit? - Are you alright? - I'm okay. - Get out. - I can stay. Get out, I don't want you in here when the hose goes flying out. C'mon, baby, c'mon, c'mon nose down, nose down, nose down. n ose down, nose down baby, c'mon. C'mon. The nose should definitely have started to come down by now. What the hell's going on? Lucky, it's almost full. Nothing, I've got no effect here. All right, keep it coming, keep the water coming. Keep the water coming Frank, more water, more water. C'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, nose down, nose down, nose down, nose down. Dammit, down, nose down! More water. Lucky! Got him. Grab him! The nose is coming down! Okay, take care of him! Yeah! What's happening? - It's coming down. - Then you think it'll work? It ain't over yet. Stop the water, Frank. Retract, retract. Get down! The computers are out! - Cockpit. - No oxygen. - No, oxygen. - There's no oxygen in the back! Whatever it takes, we're going down! Go on dammit, down! It'll take them 2 minutes to dive to 12,000. They won't last that long. Down, come down! Oh, baby! You did it! Breathe deeply, ladies and gentlemen, breathe! Still the luckiest dang kid I know! All right that's better. Put them on final. Nice work hard head, have a drink. George, George? I'm coming! - You all right? - I'm fine, just get us down. Is he gonna make it? Don't ask me for any guarantees. I don't know how he can get this thing down in one piece. Duke, your attitude sucks. Sucks? I got that from my daughter. That's affirmative, they are on approach now. Carl? Quest 19, it's your plane. - You don't want me, Jack. - The hell I don't. You're the best we've got, the most experienced. But if you can't handle this, you tell me now. Current air speed, approximately five miles west. Quest 19 cleared for straight in approach. Tower, I've got to time the gear down exactly. Can you count down my altitude for me? I'm not sure these instruments are correct anymore. Erm, roger that, you're about four miles out, 4800 feet. Visibility five miles. Broken clouds. We have emergency vehicles on the way. Ladies and gentlemen, please assume the emergency landing position. That's it sir, cross your arm, brace yourself on the seat in front of you. When do you think we should dump? - I'd say now. - George? - Now. - Let's do it. Landing gear, down. Please go down. No light, I don't have a light to affirm gear down, Lucky, I think the water maybe interfering. Quest 19, we'll confirm visually. On it, Juan, I need confirmation of gears down as she approaches. Roger, I'll call as soon as I see her out of the sky I see her, I see her. Is the gear down? Gear down and water flushing out of the nose wheel like Niagara. Quest 19, visual confirmation, your gear is down. Yes, I can feel it, the nose is coming up. She's coming in too fast. She's coming in too fast. Too fast! Quest 19, you're coming in too fast. - Reduce speed, maintain visual. - I can't control her. 300 feet. - You're gonna hit hard. - Stay in one piece baby! Duke, are you alright? Duke? Duke, are you alright? My leg won't move. Who'd have said that before we landed? It's 2 O'clock in the morning, don't you folks have anything better to do? Nothing more important than this. We were a really good team, you and me, I prayed really hard. Hey, couldn't have done it without you. So what do you want to do now? Dinner? Breakfast? Garage sale? Oh, I want to go home with you, Captain Singer. Well that's tonight. What about next June? What are you suggesting? Marriage, to each other! I'd figured next June. Umm, how's your weekend? Ahh, I think I'm free. You know, my mother always said, I was lucky.
