- Do you have to do that? - Pipe down. - Get that customer, Hattie. - If that's for me, I'm in. - Hello? - Is it for me? - I don't know. - Miss Judy? Miss Judy. It's yours, Judy. - Hello, Hags. - Hello. - Look what mother sent me from Louisiana. - What are they? Pecans. Pecans? Let's open one, maybe there's a check in it. Well, I had a date but I guess I can get out of it. - Sure, I'll get a girl. - Where is she? - Ok, who? - Not you. - Come on, take them off. - Are you speaking to me? You heard what I said, take off those stockings or I will and take at... - What do you mean? This are my stockings. - They are not. If you think I'm going to give up my lunch to buy you stockings... - Well, you owe me a pair anyway. - Mrs. Orcutt, Linda is doing a striptease. You get a bigger crowd on the streets. Why don't you split them? A stocking a piece. From now on you wear your own stockings or go barelegged. The places you go doesn't make any difference anyway. What's the trouble? Are you running a theatrical boarding house or a gymnasium? What's going on here? This is a warden who accused me of stealing my own stockings. She's swiped her last pair of stockings from me. How do you expect me to run a respectable house... You're doing the best you can. I won't be insulted by this little guttersnipe and all... - I'll guttersnipe you. - I don't that while I'm running my house... I wish you girls would find some way to settle all your differences. I'll slap her ears flat against the back of her head. - I'd like to see you try. - Oh, come on down here. - I won't room with her if you paid me to. - Good, best news I've had in the past year. - I'm moving in with Madeline right away. - Shouldn't take you very long. Everything you own is on your back. If this barroom brawl is over... When I get back to my room, you're the only thing I want to find missing. Heavens, no, at the Footlights Club? Nothing exciting ever happens here. 8 o'clock? You bet, goodbye. I knew it. Do you want a date? I said, you want a date? With some other lumbermen? Am I supposed to apologize for being born in Seattle? Well, the last couple we went stepping with were made of lumber. - Especially their feet. - Alright. You can stay here and gorge yourself on lamb stew again, my pet, want a date... - Wait, wait a minute, is it for dinner? - Yes. Oh, why didn't you say so before you spoke? That lamb stew is got me counting sheep at night. You know, you're not so particular about my friends when it's for dinner. Well, they can't step on you when you're sitting down. And you might try being just a little less insulting this time. Me? Insulting to a lumberman? Why, the very idea is preposterous. - Do we dress? - I suppose so, we usually do. Well, I'll be there my pet, you know me, the lumberman's delight. Mr. Powell's car is waiting for Miss Shaw. - I'll tell her. - Thank you. - Is that for Linda? - Mr. Powell's car. Oh, wait a minute, I'll be the carrier pigeon. Oh, Linda Mr.Powell's car is here. Mr. Powell isn't here, just his car. Peaceful little haven we have here. Anybody use a couple of tired Tyrolean peasants? - I'll take a couple on toast. - I'll take mine dry. - How was the matinee? - Very intimate. We'd 100 people on the stage and 50 in the audience. - But you had them outnumbered. - Oh, the whole thing makes me sick. What's Gerta sick about? - Five weeks' rehearsal and 2 weeks' pay. - What's the matter? Is the show closing? - Like a tired clam. - That's a shame. Oh, that's too bad. Well, let's all go on relief and get it over with. - What would that be? - Mice. - How do you get in here? - You might blast. - What? - We don't want any fish. Go around to the other door, can't you read? Did you hear that? Another show folding. Yes and if they keep on closing, we can move... right into the storehouse with the scenery. You said it. - Hattie, the mice are back. - Don't go away taxi. How many doors are there to this place? Well, there's the trap door, the humidor and the cuspidor, how many doors do you like? I only asked a simple question. Did you wish to see Mrs. Orcutt... I want to see whoever I have to about accommodations. Which keeper is on duty today Hattie? Evidently, you're a very amusing person. Well, if you'll sit over there I'll get Mrs. Orcutt, she's in the kitchen. Thank you. Thanks. If you young ladies will pardon me, I shall take the wolfhounds... for a stroll through the park. Oh, need I remind you that Mr. Powell's car awaits without? Maybe if you spoke a little louder next time, everyone in the house could hear you. Oh, I'm sorry, I forget that you're old and deaf. If you were more considerate of your elders... maybe Mr. Powell would send his car for you someday. I can hardly wait. Because he would probably take one look at you and send you right back again. - But then you have to expect that. - Is that so? You know, I think I could fix you up with Mr. Powell's chauffeur. The chauffeur has a very nice car too. Yes but I understand Mr. Powell's chauffeur doesn't goes... - as far in his car as Mr. Powell does. - Even a chauffeur has have an incentive. Well, you should know. I hope you enjoy your lamb stew again tonight. I'll be... thinking of you while dining on Pheasant Bordelaise. Bordelaise, no less. Oh, girls, listen.. Or maybe it's casserole, I'm not quite certain. Be sure not to eat the bones and give yourself away. Did you wish to see me? This is a theatrical boarding house, isn't it? - It's considered one of the finest - boarding houses, - I was somehow in doubt for a moment. Are you the person I'd see about accommodations? Accommodations? Oh yes, indeed. I hope you pardon my appearance. We've had a little trouble in the kitchen. I'll just try and see what's available. - Now let's see, Ann and Mary, they room... - I'd like a room with a private bath. Is there anything strange in that request? Oh, you mustn't mind the girls, they just full of fun. We're like one great big family. I may not be able to give you just what you want... but I can put you in a room with a very charming girl, temporarily. - That is, until we get a vacancy. - How expensive are your rooms? They're $13 if you share a room with a girl, it depends. That seems rather high, isn't there some reduction by the week? It is $13 a week. - Oh, my mistake. - That doesn't include luncheons. The meals go with the $13? Oh yes indeed and I must say we have a very lovely kitchen. Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't any change. Oh, that's all right, I expect to be here quite a while anyway. What shall I do about my baggage? It's in the taxi. Annie, will you tell Frank to get Miss... - Randall, Terry Randall. - Randall's baggage out of the taxi? Pardon me. Mrs. Orcutt... - is Mr. Hargrave of the Guild called me yet? - Why, not. When he does call tell him I've read his play and I can't... consider playing, it is far too trivial, I couldn't consider... How you do?- Miss Luther, this is Miss Randall, she's going to be with us for a while. - Oh, how nice, are you in the theater? - Not yet but I hope to be. Oh, with proper coaching, there's no reason to despair... - If you just come with me. - I beg your pardon. Here are your trunks, just take them up to Miss Maitland's room. What's that? Oh, that's one of the features of the Footlights Club. It's the chair Bernhardt sat in when she was rehearsing Queen Elizabeth over here. I was in the company. - Oh, you were an actress? - Mrs. Orcutt is played with all the stars. She supported me in lots of my shows, haven't you dear? That's Bernhardt's picture, isn't it? They say she was wonderful. Oh, she was very good, very good in some things. As a matter of fact, although isn't generally known, Bernhardt and I had the same coach. Oh, I think coaching is a waste of time. After all, acting is only common sense. But that's all a good coach applies, his common sense. If I don't get the right play soon, I may do a little coaching myself. - What is this? Another boat docking? - Mrs. Orcutt told me to put this here. - But this is not the storeroom. - You'll like this room, really will. Jean, this is your new roommate. Miss Randall Miss Maitland. - We've met before, after a fashion. - Jean is a very lively girl. I'm quite sure you'll get on very well together. Oh, I'm sure of that. - Now, if there's anything you want... - No, no, I'll be all right, I hope. When does your baggage get here? I'm expecting the bulk of it in the morning. We could leave the trunks here and sleep in the hall, there's no use crowding the trunks. I don't know what we going to do when the wolfhounds arrive. I hope you don't mind animals. Oh, not at all, I've roomed with a great many of them before. Yes, I can see that. - Fresh kill? - Yes, I trap them myself. - You mind if I ask a personal question? - Another one? These trunks full of bodies? Just those but I don't intend to unpack them. I was just thinking if the room got too crowded we could live in the trunks. Yes, that's a good idea. You don't mind helping me unpack? Oh, I beg your pardon, you're not the maid, are you? Oh, that's quite all right. What a lovely dress. - Whipped up at home by loving hands? - Every stitch. - You cook too? - Nothing fancy, just plain home cooking. I'll bet you could boil a terrific pan of water. I imagine that half that bureau is mine, you don't mind if I put this here, do you? Why not? Help scare the moths away. Oh, a friend of the family? - Happens to be my grandfather. - Grandpa? Oh, there is quite a family resemblance, especially around the whiskers. That's a fairly intelligent observation for you. I must say, he's a fairly generous old guy, as grandfathers go. He always treated me very well. I suppose if you'd had your choice you'd picked a much younger grandfather. I see that in addition to your charms... you have that insolence generated by an inferior upbringing. Fancy clothes, fancy language and everything. Unfortunately, I learned to speak English correctly. It won't be of much use to you here, we all talk pig Latin. And I use the right knife and fork, I hope you don't mind. All you need is the knife. You mind if I hang these things here? Temporarily, of course. - I must take my bath. - That might help. And remember, half the wardrobe is yours and if anything of... mine should get in the way, well, just toss it out the window. Did you get a load of that hat? I expected a rabbit to jump out any minute. I thought old Orcutt would fall over in a faint when she handed her that 50 dollars. If she'd a 50 dollar bill, what's she doing here? Ah, it must've been counterfeit. There's no such thing as a 50 dollar bill. No, I think she's as phony as that bill. - Oh, I must've missed fun. - I'd say you did. When she asked if the meals went with the 13 dollars I thought I'd bust a ligament. Maybe she's a social worker doing a little slumming. - Oh, she picked the right place. - Speaking of slum, when do we eat? Wash your necks children, the lamb is about to be sacrificed. I should worry Tonight is lumber night. - I washed my neck yesterday. - So did I. Well, I refuse to wash my neck for lamb stew. Here's Kay. - Hello. - Any luck today? No but I got great news, I actually saw one manager. The whole town is underwater, Kay saw a manager. Was it much of an interview? It wasn't an interview, I just saw him as he rushed out of his office. Now at least you know there is such an animal, what he look like? Like any other animal, he had on the pants, tie and collar... - Did he have hoofs? - Smoke come out of his nose? - That's what gets in your eyes. - Did say mama when you squeezed him? I didn't get that close to him. You didn't see a manager dearie, what you saw was a mirage. - ♪ Come and get it. ♪ - Let's go. Well, come on Henry, mother get you some of that lovely lamb stew. Maybe there's a mouse in it. - Coming Kay? - I'll be along a little later. - Aren't you having dinner? - Oh, I'm not very hungry. You've been awfully blue lately, haven't you? Well, after playing a whole season in Powell's... outer office he might at least have said hello. It gets pretty discouraging once in a while but I guess it's all in the game. - Oh Miss Hamilton... - Hello Mrs. Orcutt. - I'm afraid I must... - I know, I know what you going to say. If you could let it go just a bit longer... You know the rules of the house and it's three weeks now. I know, I've practically been promised a part and I'm not eating any meals here... You're putting me in a very embarrassing position, I don't want to be inconsiderate. Maybe I could give you a little money on account. - Say 10 dollars? - That's something. Thanks awfully. Hey there, Ella... - That's still a community tub, you know. - I'll be out in a minute. You've been in there a half hour. Well, you think you're a trained seal? What you say? Say, if you want to drown yourself, why don't you use the ocean? Hey Kay. - Why didn't you say hello to me? - Hello Jean. - I didn't see you. - You certainly couldn't help but hear me. Oh, don't pay any attention to me, my mind is been wandering lately. - What's the matter? - Oh, it's one of those days. - Let's sit down and have a good cry. - Alright. You cry on my shoulder, I'm going to go bathe anyhow. No casting today. Leave your name and telephone number and we'll get in touch with you later. Mr. Powell isn't seeing anyone until the end of the week. Last week and the week before and the week before that. Where did I ever get the idea that I was a good actress? Say, who got all those rave notices a year ago? Yeah but that was a year ago. - Oh boy, you do sound gloomy. - I don't know why I'm hanging on. Except it's nothing else I can do and no one I can go back to. Except someone I'll never go back to. Listen, you don't have to go back to anybody, you're the best actress in this whole club. Something good is bound to be coming your way. I hope so. But it'd better be soon. I don't mean to be butting into your private affairs but I'd... if it's a matter of a few bucks, I'd be very... Oh Jean, I've got to get that part in Enchanted April, it's been my whole life. It's me, no one else can play that part, it belongs to me. Oh Jean, I've got to get that part. - I've got to. - Oh honey, you don't cry. It's alright, thanks to all, that's what I call a dinner fit for a king. - If you don't care what you say. - I've got most of it caught in my teeth. Well, now I know why sheepherders go crazy, it's the lamb stew. If your cat ever turns up missing around dinner time I'm eating out that night. Say, I bet Orcutt's husband died of wool poisoning. The coffee taste like iodine, they ought to serve bandages with it. Yeah, it would make a good liniment. I can't tell you how interested I was in your... discussion of Twelfth Night, it was so intelligent. Oh, thank you very much. I'm afraid that the rest of the inmates didn't share your enthusiasm. Barbarians, they've had no training my dear, no training. - Why, when I played in Twelfth Night even... - Did you play in Twelfth Night? Yes, I... I, I've a few of my notices if you'd care to see them. - I'd love to. - Oh, how lucky, they're right on top. Now, don't read them all, just the bits that are underlined. And this one's from Atlantic City. Well, I don't like to gossip but... that new gal seems to have an awful crush on Shakespeare. I wouldn't be surprised if they got married. - Oh, you're fooling, Shakespeare is dead. - No? Well, if he's the same one who wrote Hamlet he is. - Never heard of it. - Well certainly you must've heard of Hamlet. Well, I meet so many people. Hang on to your chairs girls, we're going to get another load of Shakespeare. Is it against the rules of the house to discuss the classics? No, go right ahead, I won't take my sleeping pill tonight. It might interest you girls to know that all great actresses knew their Shakespeare. How about their onions? I fail to see what onions have to do with Shakespeare. If you'd listen to Miss Randall, you might learn something. I like Amos and Andy. In my day, we were not only actresses, we were technicians. We learned our trade from the ground up. - That's what we should've, a trade. - I want to be a Swiss bell ringer. - I want to do something with my hands. - Sit on them. You'd get further with your feet, they're bigger. The trouble with you is, you're all trying to be comics. Don't you ever take anything seriously? After you've sat around for a year trying to get a... job you won't take anything seriously either. Well, do you have to just sit around and do nothing about it? Maybe it's in the blood, my grandfather sat around till he was 80. Oh, my grandfather didn't.. And if he and a lot of others hadn't crossed the country in a... covered wagon there still be Indians living in Wichita. Who do you think is living there now? You think you're facing difficulties. What do you think of the men who crossed the Rockies? Did any of them ever try to crash a manager's office? No but if they wanted to, I'm sure they could have and I bet I can too. Maybe she can get through the door with vanishing cream. - Come on, we'll be late again. - Well, the Edelweiss girls must be off. If we're not on the stage by 8:30, the orchestra gets lonesome. Oh, stop it. - Can't we ever have any peace around here? - Quiet, Olga wants peace. - Peace at any price. - Well, you can't have peace without a war. You sound very superior, what have you ever done in the theater? Everything but burst out of a pie at a Rotarian banquet. You all talk as though the world owed you a living. Maybe if you try to do something for the theater... the theater would do something for you. - What theater? - Is there a theater? I don't know, is anybody looked up the side streets lately? Doesn't seem to me that any of you take your work very seriously or is there? Well, now that you're here, we're all giving up. At least I'm going to have a try and if I can act... I want the world to know it, if I can't, I want to know it. Even your best friends won't tell you. Be a terrific innovation if you can get your mind... stretch a little further than the next wisecrack. You know, I tried that once, but it didn't snap back into place. Miss Randall is right, all you girls want training, in my day... - When knighthood was in flower. - I beg your pardon? I'm sorry, I was just reading aloud. - Miss Canfield. - Well, who will we pick on now? - Don't pick on me. - Miss Judy. - Do I hear males? - My lumber gentlemen, no cracks. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. How do you do Mr. Dukenfield? So nice to see you again. Yeah, I manage to get down once a year, meet Mr. Milbanks. - How you do? - How do you do? You know, I've known this little gal since she was that high, in pigtails. - Well, let's skip that. - Yeah. In those days nobody ever thought that Pete Jones' daughter would be an actress. - Well, the odds are still the same. - Yeah. - Say, have you got a friend? - Oh, the charming girl for you. Here she is now. Oh Jean, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine. Don't you said they were dressing. Don't start anything here, I'll rinse your bag. - What you said with their overalls. - Oh, did she say that? Cut it out. Oh Jean, I'd like you to meet Mr. Mr. Dukenfield and Mr. Mr. Milstream. - Milbank. - What I said? Milstream. What do you do? Tear down the trees with your bare hands? - I told you she was a kick. - Yeah. - I love her sense of humor. - Yes, I can tell by the size of your shoes. - What? - Ain't she a card? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - You come from Seattle too, don't you? - Yeah, how did you know? We know all our college man. - Well, I got a taxi waiting outside. - Let's get going. Imagine that Judy, a taxi. I'll bet you drink champagne out of slippers and everything. Well, I never have. Let's go to Central Park, a lot of trees there... - we go and hang by our tails, eat coconuts. - You're killing me. Pleasant little foursome, I predict a hatchet murder before the night is over. - Hello. - And how are all your folks? What happened to you? - Nearly everything. - You're limping. Am I? Oh, so I am. Won't you ever dance with one of those Seattle Romeos? Maybe, I don't remember. - Oh, if you did, you'd remember alright. - Why you go out with them? I'll bite, why do I? They not only jump on you, but they bore you to death. I know how many cords of wood there are in a pint... and a pine tree is not deciduous, but has acidosis or something... the Oregon timberline is receding so fast that in another 1,000 years... or so, the whole state will be practically bald. Why am I telling you all this for? For what? Oh, why not? We going to share the same room, why not share our troubles? Started off on the wrong foot, let's stay that way. - Don't you ever get tired of quarreling? - What's the matter? Can't you take it? Oh yes, I can take it if you want it that way. Would you mind if I asked you a very humble question? - If you ask it in English. - What you do about air in this room? In the summertime we do without it entirely. This time of year we usually open the windows. This thing is stuck. Hey, don't pull it down from the top, we'll have the whole upper floor in our laps. - What do we do about the sign? - Just leave it there. Don't those blinking lights keep you awake? They will if you lie there and try to out blink them, we usually use these. What do I do with this? Put it over my eyes? - No, you swallow it with a glass of water. - That's a very ingenious idea, thanks. - Oh, don't get sentimental. - You go to sleep right away? - Sure, what do you go to bed for? - Well, I thought we might talk. I've had enough talk for one evening. I suppose you're wondering why I'm living here. Oh, maybe I am, why don't you sell some of those clothes and live in a decent place? - Isn't this a decent place? - No. Besides, I've always longed to live in an atmosphere like this. My pet, you haven't seen atmosphere. Wait till about 5 o'clock in the morning when those garbage trucks start around. - Say, am I getting good or you getting weak? - No, that just struck me as funny. It isn't very funny to me. If I had your clothes, I'd scram out of here plenty fast... and leave you here with your atmosphere. Oh no, you wouldn't. You bark a lot but you don't bite, you wouldn't sell out for a wardrobe. It's all right for you to talk, you've got yours. - Linda isn't doing so bad either. - Linda? Oh, the other girl you fight with. One of them, I don't know. Maybe you two girls have got the right idea. - What idea is that? - Stop kidding. - Oh, you mean having a grandfather. - Call him whatever you like. Well, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have a grandfather. Says you. Well, who's in a better position to give advice... than a woman who allows her grandfather to buy her clothes? - What you say? - I've said, who's in a better position... Never mind, write it on a piece of paper and I'll read it in the morning. Down. Up, two, three. Tilt. - Snap the heads over there. - Alright alright alright. That's enough for today, go to home. Out. Oh, thought he'd never call a time out, we ought to get him a whip. Get me a wheelchair. Say, let's run through our routine before Olga gets away. I'm going to dance any more, you better dash home and get my extra pair of legs.. Why don't you quit running around with those lumberjacks and get some sleep? Say Olga, will you vent Troubles for me a couple of times? When am I going to get any time for my concert practice? Oh, be a good girl, a good lumber famous will buy you a lollipop. Alright alright, and for this I studied with Kolijinsky. Well, well, well Tony Powell, how are you? - Hello Alex, how's the new school? - Oh, just fine, glad you came up. - Nothing to put on musical, are you? - Oh, no. I very likely won't produce anything unless I could find an angel. - You haven't seen any flying around here? - No, not lately. Hit it Olga. Who's the little blonde? Oh, just one the kids, you like to meet her? Never mind, I'll introduce myself. Look who's giving us the once-over. - Where? - Over there. - Who is it? - Nobody but Anthony Powell. So that's Linda's soul mate, who's he staring at? - I don't know but I hope it's me. - You can have him. - You girls rehearsing for a musical? - No, we're just getting over the DTs. Nice routine you've got there. - I hear yours isn't so bad either. - We haven't come to the best part of it yet. What's the matter with your girlfriend? Oh, what? She's kind of nervous, you know, meeting a great man like you. - Do I make you nervous too? Well, a little, of course I wouldn't admit that to you. And you two kids expect to go on the stage? Well, we're just sort of hoofing it around. You know, waiting for someone to discover us. Well, you're discovered. Well, I didn't mean it that way really, just we're waiting for a high sort of engagement. - Something like the, the Grotto, you know. - The Grotto? Well, I think you'd better excuse me, I guess you're kind of making me a little nervous. Excuse me. You know, there's nothing like a cheerful letter from home. Pa got laid off, my sister's husband is left her... one of my brothers slugged a railroad detective. I guess that's all. Lots of love and can you spare 50 bucks? How you like that vegetable soup tonight? It's been a little thicker, would made nice hot water. If she trey to serve it again, I'm going to bring a bar... of soap to the table and wash out a few stockings. She must've gotten that meatloaf from the Smithsonian Institute. - I wonder what was in it. - I don't want to know. By way of variety, let's complain about the food. If you weren't so snooty you could had a dinner date with me tonight. You can have my share of those timber wolves. They may be timber wolves to you, but to me they're meat and potatoes. Don't you know any younger men? I'm tired of buying dinners for younger men. She needs a good bawling out. - Don't you start that again. - Start what? Well, we were rehearsing our routine today and who should walk up to us but Tony Powell. - So what? - Not the great Anthony Powell? He was very pleasant to us, even wanted to know all about us. And she runs out on him like he was a bed of poison ivy. - I didn't like the way he looked at me. - Should be glad he looked at you at all. He makes you feel like you ought to run home and put on a tin overcoat. Listen and don't forge I'm part of this team... and you think I'm practicing just to run away from managers, you're crazy. Oh, you're interfering with my art. He wasn't looking for an act, he was putting one on. You ought to stop at a filling station and get pumped up. No, she ain't exactly a flat dearie, just a slow leak. If not food, it's men, can't you talk about anything else? And what else is it? - Hiya Kay, what you got? A script? - Yes. Say, don't you eat here anymore, you lucky girl? Well, some friends of mine are in town and I've been seeing quite a bit of them lately. Not some of those tree chopper downers I hope. No, just people. Pardon me but there's a dust storm blowing up there. - How do you do? - Have we met socially? I hope not. Hey, that's a kind of good looking piece of jackrabbit you got there. Oh, it's just a little trinket my Aunt Susan sent over. Say, I think it's very unselfish of those little animals... to give up their lives so to keep other animals warm. You know, they're very smart of an animal... they never give up their lives for the wrong people. Oh, you understand the rodent family much better than I do. Incidentally, I saw your Aunt Susan... today and I think you show much better taste than he does. - It don't make much difference. - Lucy... You can think of a bright remark while I answer the telephone. Don't forget Aunt Susan's car is waiting for you outside. Hello? This is Miss Maitland speaking. Yes? Mr. Burger? At the Club Grotto? Where? When? Ok, I'll go right over, thanks ever so much. Call out the Marines kids, the Depression is over. What's the matter with you? You going screwy? Come on, string bean. Hey, come on. - Wake up, let's get going. - It's a fire? You know, that was Gordon from the dancing school. What did he do, propose? No, he said rush go over to the club, Club Grotto and see a man by the name of Burger. Yeah, what about? What about is he's got an opening in his floor show. The good thing is it's no opening in the floor, you'd fall through on that. I don't know, I'm a stranger here myself. She hasn't worked in so long, if she does... get the job it'll practically amount to a comeback. They never seem to be at a loss for action around here. - It's a little like a three-ring circus. - A little bit. - They're a great bunch of girls. - I think so. They don't seem feel the same way about me though. You mustn't mind them. I'm beginning to feel that there's something definitely wrong with me. - You're different, that's all. - Want know why. I eat the same food, I sleep in the same kind of bed, I've even got a... crease across my back from that lumpy mattress, now I'm doing my... best to pick up their slang, though I'm not so hot. How's that? Not so hot. They'll get to understand you after a while. - Maybe you'll get to understand them with... - I suppose so. They do make a lot of noise but it's just to keep up their courage and hide their fears. Oh now, what they got to be afraid of? Certainly they young enough to have courage. Young enough to have fears too. You saw how excited Jean and Ann got just now... and that wasn't a job even, just the prospect of one. You don't know what it means, waiting and hoping that some manager will interview you. Well, at least you don't have that worry, I saw you in that play last year. You know you're a good actress. I'm not so sure anymore, how do you know who's an actress and who isn't? You're an actress if you're acting but you can't just walk up and down a room and act. Without that job and those lines to say... an actress is just like any ordinary girl trying not to look as scared as she feels. It's something I dashed off in the kitchen I want you to try. - But Hattie I've had my dinner. - But this is something extra special. I'm practicing cooking in my spare time. Well, I'm glad that someone in that kitchen is practicing. I'll just leave it there, you may get hungry after a while. If I don't hear any screams, I'll know I'm a success. - Hattie... - Coming. I told you to wash those dishes. Why do you do things like that? - So that's final? - Yes Dad, that's final. I'm sorry. I thought by now you might have satisfied this... silly whim of yours and been ready to come back home. If I thought that I couldn't achieve anything by myself without the aid of the... family millions I'd feel like a pretty sorry specimen. Why must it be the stage? - There are other things to achieve in life. - It's not life. This happen to appeal to me. Why did Grandfather Randall leave a comfortable home and... - go off pioneering into an unknown country? - He made sacrifices for a reason. So that his family could have economic security. Security from what? So that I can learn to play a mean game of bridge... or ride the hounds or marry a polo player? Is that why Grandfather Randall endured all those hardships? - But you got the family name to consider. - Don't worry about the family name. As far as New York is concerned Terry Randall is... just another stage struck girl from the Middle West. They don't know me from Eve. But they're going to, if I have anything to say about it. I'm sorry but I can't support you in this idea any longer. Financially or morally? If you're going on with this notion, you got to do it alone. - Alright then, I'll have to do it alone. - What if you're a failure? What then? If I'm a failure, I'll be the first to admit it. But it may take years to find out. Dad, it may take years to know anything about anything but I'm going to stick to it. Well, are you too proud to come back home if you, if you are a failure? I haven't got that kind of pride. - But you would come home if you failed? - Would you have me? Well, you're, you're pretty stubborn, but you're still my favorite daughter. We'll leave it there, check please. Well hello Mr. Powell, how are you? So nice to see you again. Miss Shaw, may I present Mr. Powell? - How you do? - How you do? - Won't you join us? - I hope I'm not intruding. Intruding? Well, I should say not. There we are. How many times have we been introduced? You have any idea? Thirty seven, including this evening. Thank you, I wonder if we're fooling anybody but ourselves. - You're in a very ugly humor this evening. - Don't you like it? If I have to have a stooge, you might at least get me someone interesting. I hate that word stooge, I'm retained her as an escort. Stooge is good enough, let's get out of here, I'm bored to death. Oh, why not relax? There are a couple of new numbers I'd like to see. Oh, are you getting interested in new numbers? Shall I join in the conversation just so people think we're all together? I think I can get you a job with a ventriloquist. Well, life is full of surprises. - A cute kids, aren't they? - You think so? Wonder who they are. Just a lot of riffraff they pick up around town. Pardon me Mr.Powell, you're wanted on the phone. Thank you. I'll be right back. Why don't you two dance? Remember, if you get any wrong numbers, you can always get your nickel back. - Shall we dance? - No. - Did you hear what she called us? - What do you mean us? I'll riffraff her, I could hit her with the head of this stick. Well, you did everything but poke her eye out with it. The way that Powell sat grinning at us, I could hit him too. That's all we need. What do you mean, that's all we need? Well, I heard tonight that he owns half interest in this club. Or did you know that? I thought it was kind of funny that we should happen to get this job all of a sudden. And then came the dawn. You think he has anything to do with us being here? Attagirl Sherlock... I bet that you could put two and two together and get something out of it. - So that's it. - Oh, don't be a dope. If he smiled at me tonight the nice way he smiled at you, I'd do a three point collapse. May I come in? - Oh, how do you do Mr. Powell? - How you do? - Yes, come on in. - I thought you girls were good tonight. - Thank you, we thought so too. - Mind if I sit down? - Why not? Your club. - Not exactly, I have a small interest in it. Oh, don't pay any attention to her Mr. Powell, she's slightly barmy. You don't like me, do you? Oh, how could I help but like a man who takes his mother out to a nightclub? - That was your mother you were sitting with? - No, no, that was my friend's mother. - Oh, then I can speak freely? - Go right ahead. I think your friend shows very bad taste in picking mothers. I'm beginning to think so myself. Now, my ideal mother is young, blond, slim and generally intriguing. I'll see if I can get you one for Mother's Day. - How do you like them? Tall, fat, round? - Well, about your size. That wouldn't be so easy. You see, I'm not the stock size. Couldn't we talk the whole thing over at dinner tonight? Oh, I'm very fond of dinner, do you suppose you could send your car around for me? Where would I send it? I'm living at the Footlights Club but the traffic around there is rather heavy. I see. So I think you'd better send it around here first. Perhaps that would be better. Shall we say tomorrow night, after the show? - Mom will have a lamp in the window. - Good night. No Mr.Powell isn't in today. Did you have an appointment? Hello? Of course, I could wait around if thought there's any chance... Well, you could wait but I'm sure there's little chance to see him. Thanks, I'll wait. Hello. I'm sure I don't know, you might call later. No Mr.Powell is out of town for the weekend. How you like that? Out of town. I guess that must've been his double peeking through the door a little while ago. Imagine opening a great big office like this just not to see people. You can go in. Mammy singer? Maybe when Powell left town he forgot to take his shoes with him. - Hello Kay. - Hello. Surely you better sit down Mr.Powell is out of town, got in a world tour. Be careful what you say, he'd be hiding under the linoleum. Oh, we're kidding, he isn't seeing anybody except by appointment. I've got an appointment, I'm going to read that part today. - May I touch you? - You'll knock him off his chair. I hope so, I've been studying all night. - You have appointments too? - We're waiting for Randall. If she doesn't crash Powell's office by 2 o'clock, she's buying us the lunch. We starting off with caviar, not that small sturgeon kind but nice big whale caviar. Oh Miss Hamilton. - Good luck kid. - The best. Oh, I'm sorry Miss Hamilton, you can't go in now. I tried to get you on the phone. Some unexpected business came up that Mr. Powell will have to cancel that appointment. - Oh, I can wait. - It's impossible to see him today. You'll have to make it next week sometime, he'll get in touch with you. If I can only see him for five minutes, I know that... I'm sorry, you'll have to make it next week. Please make it today because... because... Here, you mustn't, Oh, somebody catch her. - Get some water for her. - You get out of here we'll take care of her. - Oh, I hope it's nothing I said. - Put her on the couch. What's happened? Powell broke an appointment with her and when the... secretary told her about, she went out like a light. - Be alright. - Let me help. - Give me the water. - She'll be Ok. - Oh, try rubbing her hands. - Come on darling, you fainted dear. He's a great guy, breaks an appointment with an actress to get his shoes shine. - Well, you must remember that Mr. Powell... - Who that Powell think he is? - Here, you can't go in there. - Just watch me. - Are you the great Anthony Powell? - Well, who might you be? - That's not important. - By what right you complain... By what right you barricade yourself behind closed doors and refuse to see people? - That happens to be none of your business. - You know a girl just fainted in your... own office because you broke an appointment with her? I'm sorry, I didn't know. You know, if you keep that door closed, you'll never know anything... you're a producer, you ought to see people. Why, the greatest actress in the world might be living out there... 15 feet away from you and you'd never even give her a chance. - Are you the greatest actress in the world? - Never mind about me. I don't need you but those other girls do, they sweat and slave and go without... food and decent clothing in the hope that... someday someone like you will come out of his office and notice her. I'm sorry Mr. Powell, that young woman rushed in before I could stop her. It's alright Miss Hart, what happened with the girl who fainted? She's fine, her friends are taking her home. - I'll ring when I want you. - Thank you. - Sit down young lady, I want to talk to you. - Go ahead. - Alright sonny. - Yes sir. - Sit down. - Alright, I'm sitting. Now listen my militant friend... I judge from your attitude that you hold me personal responsible... for any possible tragedy in the lives of the girls that come up here, that correct? No, it isn't. But I think you ought to see those people, maybe they got something. You know, maybe they have. Do you realize that if I saw all of the girls... that came up here that I wouldn't have time for anything else? Every year, about 50,000 girls, will you please sit down... - You making me nervous. - I am sitting, say something. Every year about 50,000 girls decided... they want to go on the stage for one reason or another. Well, 49,500 of them are wrong, they'd be much better at home washing dishes. How about the other 500? You see them? Well, I couldn't see them if I wanted to, there's at least 50 girls for every job. How you know you get the right ones? You haven't even the common courtesy to go out there and say no to them. At least, that would give them some contact with the theater. Well, you're one that can't complain and I've seen you and you're not the type. You're very smug Mr. Powell, very. Well, whether or not you're satisfied that I'm not entirely... responsible for all of the ills of the theatrical profession... may I suggest that you run along and leave alone with my conscience. I doubt if you have a conscience. Miss Arden, I won't see anybody else today, I don't care who. Oh, he's here? Oh hello Mr. Carmichael, come in. Hello Mr. Powell. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. I hope this has nothing to do with that. That other matter, I thought that was all settled. - Oh no, it isn't anything like that. - That's fine, sit down. - Thank you. - Have a cigar? Cigarette? - No, thank you. - Cigarette? No. We just had a little excitement around here. Yes, I couldn't help but hear, who's the girl? Oh, I haven't the faintest idea. Some stage struck damsel suffering from over excitment. Is she an actress? If she is, she's a pretty bad one, I can tell a mile off. - You're sure of that? - Oh, I seldom miss. Something ought to be done about these girl... that come to New York and try to go on the stage. They'd be so much better off at home raising families. - That's what my client thinks. - Client? - Oh, you're producing a new play shortly. - Enchanted April, why? Well, the client I just spoke of is somewhat interested in the theater. I can't mention any names, of course. You know how those people are but... somewhere he got the idea that he'd like to dabble in show business. Well, fresh money is always welcome. Under the circumstances, I'm not so sure that you would be interested. Under what circumstances? However, here's the proposition, we may as well go over it. Afterward, if you're still interested, well, we can go on from there. Hello hello? No, this is the Footlights Club, Footlights. No, foot. How can it be the Beacon Laundry when it's the Footlights Club? Certainly, I'm sure, I'm right in it. Is that so? Well, go wash your own neck and see how you like it. - How's Kay feeling? - Oh, she's alright. - What did the doctor say was wrong? - Malnutrition, he called it. - That's Latin for not eating. - All she needs is some good meals. Try and get them and a nice long rest. Well, she hasn't worked in almost a year, that's just the same as a rest. Come here, shake your head. - Why? - Never mind, shake your head. Like this? That's what I thought, I can hear it rattle just as plain. - What that's? - Nothing. Well, I hope dear old Mr. Anthony Powell sleeps well tonight. What's this I hear about the Randall girl telling him off this afternoon? No, I didn't hear what she said, but she sure made a lot of noise. It cost us lunch and I hate to say it, but I am revising my opinion of her. - Is Mr. Powell's car come yet? - Oh, I ain't seen, I ain't heard the horn. Maybe that's him now. I ain't see how I keep going paying my board here. It's all done with mirrors. - Is Miss Jean Maitland live here? - Yes. - Will you give her these? - I'll see that she gets them. - Thank you Hattie. - Oh, don't think they're for you. - Oh yes, I recognize the florist. - The boy said they're for Jean. Oh, so they are. - Let me take them to her. - Anything to save me from a trip upstairs. Looks like there's a new queen bee buzzing around the hive. It seems to be the same king. - How's Kay? - She's fine. It's so silly about her to have gone without food. Oh, yes, I think it's terribly silly to go without food. I didn't mean it that way. - What did the doctor say? - She's going to be alright. I think it was very stupid about not to let people know. - Was very sweet of you to send the doctor. - Don't say nothing to anybody. - Nobody knows. - I know but please don't mention it again. It's not that I'm sentimental, it's just that the whole thing seems unnecessary to me. May I come in? Oh, sure, I guess you'll be safe. The exterminators won't be here till tomorrow. How did they miss you all the last with you? I was out in society with an old boyfriend of yours. Oh, you speaking of funerals, these flowers just arrived for you. And you brought them up? Forty little flower girl. If I could find my purse, I'd give you a big 5 cent tip. I really came along to give you a tip. And don't bother to read the note, I'll tell you what it says: Eleven roses and the 12th is you. You're doing very well up to now, tell me more. His routine is pretty much the same with all the girls. It all ends up with a quiet little supper in his penthouse... with champagne and all the trimmings and the view and all that. And then there's Harcourt, Harcourt is really a gem. That isn't Harcourt you're wearing, is it? No, my sweet, that's a little thing called a star sapphire. Harcourt is the butler. He's very discreet though. You know, one of those butlers that tiptoes backwards. Yes. I know the type very well. But you'll get to know him much better and he's very deaf. You really won't have to bother to scream for help. Now, I mustn't forget to tell you about the lighting effect. It's very good, it goes with that tired little boy routine. But I won't spoil it for you, I'll let all that come as a surprise. Must be galling to you older women to lose your meal ticket to a younger riffraff. Just a leave of absence dearie and in the meantime I have... my lovely sable coat and my star sapphire to keep me company. It's lovely but I'm afraid you paid too much for it. That's your mistake, I'm not as generous as my Aunt Susan. Oh, goodbye, thanks for calling, if you ever need a good... pallbearer, remember I'm at your service. Didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help overhearing. You're not really running around with that man Powell, are you? Why not? Well, why play with fire just to spite Linda? - I can take care of myself. - I think you need a governess. Why shouldn't I go out with him? I think he's very charming. So snakes. Besides, if I don't go out with him I'd probably lose my job... and so do Ann and I'll be right back where I started from. Oh, that's a rather lame excuse. You got along somehow before, didn't you? Oh, I'm sick of getting along somehow. Why don't you stick to your ideals? They're rather crude but they're alright. You should talk? For heaven's sake, don't bring up that grandfather thing again, anything but that. - Besides, it's none of your business. - I'm sorry ma'am. That's a very beautiful ermine jacket you have on, remarkably similar to one of mine. Oh, I didn't expect you back so soon. Don't think I intended to borrow or anything, I just wanted to see how I'd feel in one of these things. - Do you feel very different? - I'll say. - Well, why don't you wear it? - Do you mean it? Oh, why not? You may as well go to perdition in ermine, you're sure to come back in rags. You know, you're funny, in some ways, you're not such a bad egg. - As eggs go, I probably have my points. - Gee, thanks. Not at all, not at all, anything for old Seattle. Well, I'm not sure about dinner, just a minute. Hattie, what's on the menu tonight? - What do you think? - Well, don't tell me. I believe I could manage it. Yes, I'll try to get another girl. 8 o'clock, time. Oh, what the well dressed roommate will wear. Pardonnez moi. Take a look Henry, that's where you'll wind up if you don't behave yourself. If your line isn't too busy tonight, I have a couple of lumber... Oh no, no, don't mention the word lumber. I am dining tonight on Pheasant Bordelaise... with the peach fuzz dressing... - Where is Bordelaise? - She doesn't even know what pheasant is. Naturally, there's a difference between Pheasant and peasant. Oh, my friend wouldn't think of serving peasants. No but he's willing to take them out once or twice. But when he's through, he's through, that's what I love about my friend. It's one thing to borrow a friend's friend, it's another thing to hold him. If you know what I mean. Would you mind telling the lady that I don't want to buy anything today? Goodbye all and when I return, I should tell you how the other half lives. Nice meeting you. If it's not asking too much, let's not be late again. Lead the way Higgins. You don't suppose she was burned up by any chance, do you? Why don't you two have it out with sharp knives? - Hello Bill. - Hi palsie, hello Ann. Hello, make it snappy, we're in a hurry. - What's the matter with her? - Oh, just a grouch, when did you get back? This morning, show was one of the quickest flop of the year... in spite of one of the best press campaigns of this or any other season.. - No thanks, gave it up when I was seven. - Bright girl, busy tonight? Yeah. Well, I couldn't give you very much time tonight anyway but... how about dinner tomorrow night? - I don't think I can very well. - Why not? Well, since we've gotten this job, I haven't had much time for anything. You haven't given up eating, have you? It isn't that, it's just that I don't think we better see each other for a while. - Why? - I just think it's better, that's all. Oh? - Why do you say oh like that? - Oh, how would you say it? You make it sound like it meant something else. Well, does it? Whatever I do is my own business. - Are you coming or aren't you? - Oh, shut up. Did you eat something sour for lunch today? I'm sorry Bill but I got to live my own life from now on. Sure... but it wouldn't interfere with your life I walk down to the corner with you, with it? No, I guess not. Well, that's 50,000 you owe me, what you going to do? - One shake, double or nothing. - Alright, go ahead. We're even. Did you enjoy your supper? - I didn't dare to. - Why not? Make it too tough to go back to that lamb stew. You don't have to go back if you don't want to. - You have suppers like this all the time? - Well, practically all the time, why? Just wonder, I wish I'd been born lucky instead of beautiful and hungry. You can't have everything but you are beautiful. I'm the lucky one. Will you have a little champagne? No thanks, I won't be able to stand up as it is. - I knew she was lying to me. - Who? - He isn't deaf at all. - Hasn't been. No, just shows you can't trust people nowadays. That's right, you can't. Don't you think you better have a little coffee? - Oh, that's a wonderful view. - Oh yes, it is, it's a wonderful view. It's a beautiful city, just like a fairyland. It's full of color, romance, illusion, glamor. Maybe it depends on which window you see it from. You should see it only from here. - Do those lights keep you awake? - So far they haven't. I love New York from up here. So rouged and manicured and ready to go out for the evening. You're quite a little philosopher, aren't you? - It's probably the champagne talking. - Mighty good talk. - That's mighty good champagne. - Let's have a little more of both. Alright. Who are the 3 little men? Oh, they're 3 little figures I picked up in the Orient. - Anyone I should know? - I don't know. This one takes care of all good little girls who work very hard for a living. And this one sees to it that they meet the right people. - And this one... - This one went to market. Yes and he also sees to it that little girls don't have to eat lamb stew. - Did you pick her up in the Orient too? - No, that's Mrs. Powell. We're not divorced or anything like that and that's, that's Junior. Fine looking boy, isn't he? I never believe in making pretenses. Lots of men who are separated from their wives... see to let it be understood that they're not married. I believe, in this day and age... that a man can have his home on one hand and still live his own life. - That is, any man of character. - That's big of you. - Well, it happens to be the way I believe. - That is very big of you. Why don't you relax? A few things I want to talk over with you. After all, you must be very tired dancing all evening. Here, st down right here, that's right. Oh, there you are again. I'm glad you're not deaf because if you were deaf you wouldn't be able to hear anything. And that would be terrible. - Yes ma'am, that would be terrible. - Sure would be terrible. Be awful. I never know whether he's coming out or going in. - What happened? - Isn't that more restful? - I thought something blew out. - It does improve the view, doesn't it? It's beautiful. It's beautiful now but think of how much more beautiful... it'll be when your name is flashing across the horizon. Jean Maitland in letters that big. - That big. - Alright, that big. - Got to be big enough to keep people awake. - It'll be big enough. I'll be the sculptor and you'll be the clay. I'll mold you into the greatest dancer that Broadway has ever known. I'll be Pygmalion, you'll be Galatea. - Sounds like a fairy story. Isn't life a fairy story and aren't grown up people just little children at heart? Oh, I know at the office, I'm gruff Anthony Powell, theatrical producer, that's a pose. Here with you I'm just a tired little boy with a dream. Who were you supposed to be? You were supposed to be somebody and I was... - supposed to be somebody. - Pygmalion and Galatea. - And who am I? - You're Galatea. - Am I Galatea? - Oh, yes. Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved a statue of a woman out of marble. The statue was so beautiful that he fell in love with it. And his love was so deep and tender and true... that it warmed the statue to life and they lived happily ever after. Did they get married? Oh no, I don't think people got married in those days. Oh, I think that's terrible. - What's terrible? - They didn't get married. - But she was just a statue. - That's what's so terrible about it. - You can't cry over a statue. But the whole thing's a merry story. - No but look at all the trouble he went to. - He didn't go to any trouble. You're just getting hysterical and besides, he had a wife and son and couldn't get married anyway, Harcourt. Should've thought of that in first place, she was probably minding her own business. Now you're getting yourself all excited over nothing. I'm not excited and it may be nothing to you but it was something to her. - He can't do that to her. - No, you bet he can, you bet. Well, why don't you do something about? And I'm going to do something about it the very first thing in the morning. Now, you run along and get some sleep and don't worry about a thing. I had my lawyer straighten the whole thing out. What thing? Whatever there is to be straightened out, I'll see to straightened out. Don't you worry your pretty head about a thing. - Oh, you're wonderful. - Harcourt is right here. Harcourt will see you to your car, that's a good girl. - You're wonderful. - That's right, you're wonderful... and I'm wonderful and Harcourt is wonderful, the whole thing is wonderful. You seem to be rather high yourself. You must had a pretty good time tonight. - I'll say it was wonderful. - Oh, yes. The view was wonderful, the supper was wonderful. I won 50,000 dollars and Harcourt is wonderful. - And who's Harcourt? - What's his name? - You know your own name? - It's going to be in letters that big. - No, that big. - Whose, yours or Harcourt is? You said it. And he's going to divorce his wife and marry Galatea. - And who's Galatea? - I, she's a statue. She should never got married in the first place. But it's been to be wonderful. Yes, I'm sure that everything is going to be very wonderful. The view is wonderful. And Harcourt is wonderful and you are. And Harcourt is wonderful and you are wonderful. - And you're wonderful. - And I'm wonderful too. Now come on, let me help you take off your things. Now, we all going to go to the wedding. - Say, you going to be there too. - I'll be there. Harcourt is going to marry Galatea and we're all going to live together... - in a great big sign and I feel terrible. - But isn't it wonderful? And tomorrow you going to have a wonderful hangover and that won't be so wonderful. It's wonderful, it's wonderful. Well, that's my story, how did you get in the theater? How did any of us get in the theater? I've never even been in a theater except as a spectator. Where you first get the bug Judy? I guess started with me when I was a little girl. I went to see a circus and there was a beautiful lady in pink tights. - Wasn't you, was it? - No. I don't like pink. - She was riding a large white horse. - Sure it wasn't a purple cow? Oh, whatever it was, here I am, no horse, no job, not even the pink tights. Is Mr. Powell's car calling for you at the Grotto tonight? Mr. Powell's car calls for me every night. I was just wondering, I saw Mr. Powell at... the Colonie Bar this afternoon with another young lady. However, you've done much better than I... expected, I didn't think you'd last this long. Is madame certain she hasn't been seeing things? Madame is quite certain. Oh, you probably get a note later saying he's been detained on business. When Mr. Powell doesn't send his car he always... sends a note, he's quite courteous that way. This is where I came in, let's get going. I expect this to be the best play I've ever produced. Every actress on Broadway has begged to play the part of Jeanette. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best parts ever written. Isn't that more restful? On the contrary. It makes me rather uncomfortable. Why don't you relax? Let me tell you the story of the play. - Go ahead. - The scene opens on Long Island. It's a beautiful, beautiful day in spring... and Jeanette, that's the character I want you to play, is brokenhearted. Her husband is about to leave her. Are you sure that you brought me here to discuss the play? Why you ask? - Well, I'm a rather suspicious person. - But you want to be a star, don't you? Under the proper circumstances. Why don't you sit back on the couch? It's more comfortable. Would you like to see your name blazing across the horizon... In big letters but it must be a good sized sign, I'm used to that so is Jean Maitland. - What she got to do with it? - Are you love with her? - No. - I thought so. She's just girl I took an interest in. As a matter of fact, she's becoming more or less of a pest. - Say, what are you? A district attorney? - Not exactly. So what is Jean Maitland to do with this discussion? Do you want to play this part or don't? I'm really tremendously flattered, but how do you know that I can act? Because I know. How do you know? You've never seen me on the stage. - And how do you know that? - Because I've never been on the stage. - But I did see you perform in my office. - I wasn't performing that day. But whether you were performing or not, I do know an actress when I see one. - I don't see how can you tell... - You ever stop asking questions. I'd just like to know why... You don't have to know anything, I'll do the talking. Now, whether you were acting in my office or no... you did show fire and emotion and that's what I need in this part. But I'm not an emotional person. You will be when I get through with you on moldering you. Oh, I don't want to be molded. I believe in acting with my brain. When I'll mold you one of those also, Hartcourt, will you have champagne? - No, thanks. - Well, would you mind if I do? Go ahead. - Were you expecting someone sir? - No, get the champagne. I'll answer the door. You mind if I answer the door? - Well, how did you get up here? - Have you got a woman in this apartment? - Who wants to know? - Who has a better right? Now see here, I'm in a very bad humor, you get downstairs the way you got up. How can you shout at me after all you promised last night? I'm not shouting I didn't promised anything. Where is she? Say, by what right do you come crashing into this... So it's you. Hello. - Say, what is this? - That's what I'm asking. Mr. Powell was just telling me the plot of a play. So that's how you happens to be on the floor. Come on, get up. That isn't where I left you. What is this? A frame-up? - Tony darling, control yourself. - Don't Tony darling me, now you come on. Get up out of there. And you go home immediately. I'll go home when you hear what I got to say. Just say it and get over with, she came up here to sign a contract to do a play. What's she going to sign it with? Champagne? - Harcourt, call the manager. - Oh, you needn't get any manager. I thought I was in love with you but I see my mistake now. I only went out with you in the first place to spite Linda. Yes, you better hide your face, you double dealing, double crossing.. Darling, I didn't know what I was doing. My own roommate and you preach ideals, you and your grandfather. Look, I had enough of this nonsense. Preaches ideals so she can chisel when my back is turned. Well, you can take your old red fox cape. I'll never borrow another thing again from you as long as I live. - Don't try to borrow anything from me. - Please, don't start that again. I hope you two snakes will be very happy together, you too, you reptile. Never mind. - What's so funny? - Everything. Well, it isn't funny at all. What it's suppose she thinks? Exactly what I want her to think. Why? Why? Well, for several reasons. In the first place, I like her. - She won't like you very much after this. - Oh, she'll see the light in time. You mean you jeopardize your own reputation? - Aren't you a kind of a Girl Scout? - Just a girl who uses her brain. - Anyhow, I wanted show you that I can act. - You are a faker. Oh, we're both fakers. Isn't faking the essence of acting? Well, it may apply to actors, but it does not apply to me. - You, you're a bigger faker than I am. - Such libel. Not if I can prove it. Now, this young man is your son, isn't he? - Please keep my family out of this. - And if he's your son, he must... be a lot older than you are, because that photo is been used... to advertise a certain military academy for a great number of years. - How do you know? - Because my brother went to that academy. And this lady, whom you pretend is your wife... she's done a lot of posing for the face powder ads. My friend, you have just broken up a very, very convenient marriage. I think that we understand each other. - Now, what about the play? - Oh yes, yes, where were we? - We were in Long Island. - Yes, the scene opens on Long Island. Beautiful, beautiful day in spring... - and Jeanette, that's the character... - Yes, that's me. That's right, is brokenhearted, she's about to lose her husband. Not exactly the way I just lost my wife but... - She's coming. - Oh, my. - Where is everybody Hattie? - I don't know, where you want them to be? Oh Madeline told me someone down here wanted to see me. Well, if somebody is here to see you, I'd better turn on the lights and give a chance. It's for you Ann, it's for you Ann. - I feel like crying. - No. - Oh, no speeches at this banquet, don't. - You're the guest of honor. I see you remembered the right number of years. We won't tell on you if you don't tell on us. Take a big blow and make a wish. No wait a minute, I have to turn the lights off. Make a wish. - Quiet, everybody. - And don't tell us what it is, that's fatal. I guess everyone knows what it is without my telling you. It's coming true, I can feel it in my bones. She made it. It's so beautiful, I hate to cut it. That's one of Hattie's cake, maybe you can't cut it. I resent that. Be careful you don't drop it on your foot. - Girls, I've the most wonderful news. - Oh, maybe the house is on fire. I've just been talking to Terry Randall. - Oh, what's wonderful about that news? - Maybe she's had an accident. She's going to play the leading part in Anthony Powell's new play. - Randall? - Isn't that exciting? And I've only been coaching her such a short time. Maybe that's why she got the part. - Which, which play is she going to do? - His new play. - Enchanted April? - Yeah. - The part of Jeanette? - Isn't it hard to believe? Perhaps you girls will change your opinion of Miss Randall after this. Perhaps you'll change your opinion of me too. And perhaps you'll pay more attention to your theatrical training. Poor kid, we can't even have a birthday... party without Randall or something else crabbing it. Why don't you leave Randall alone? She hasn't harmed anyone. No but she always looks like she's ready to start. Olga is right, she hasn't harmed anyone. All she did was steal the part you wanted to do. It wasn't my part because I wanted. Last year I took a part away from a girl who wanted. - No, this is different. - It isn't different. Isn't there enough heartache in the theater without our hating each other? - Honey, you're crying. - I'm crying because I'm happy. I've had my moments in the theater and I think Terry deserves her chance. If you say anything to her, that won't get the part for me, will it? There's going to be other parts and other plays. This is my birthday and I'm going to be happy, the devil with the theaters. Alright folks, let's begin, we'll take the scene over again from the beginning. Go right ahead, go ahead. Here she is now, coming up the garden path. - Oh, what we going to say to her? - I don't know. The poor child, she's probably brokenhearted. You better let me talk to her first. Well? Come on Miss Randall, this is your cue. I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were rehearsing again. In the theater Miss Randall, we're supposed to come in on cue. Yes but there are some men out there fooling around with ropes and things... could you ask them to stop? We find it necessary in the theater to have... men fooling around with ropes and things Miss Randall. If you'd just pay more attention to your cues... and not contradict so many times you might get better results. - Well, you needn't be sarcastic about it. - I apologize deeply. - Now get out and come in on cue. - Alright, don't get excited. I just can't hear anything with these people. Alright, go ahead. The poor child, she's probably brokenhearted. - You better let me talk to her first. - Hello Mother hello Dad hello Kate. The calla lilies are in bloom again, such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now I... place them here in memory of something that is died. - He needs a good thrashing. - You poor child. Are you gathered here to mourn or have you come to bring me comfort? You know, there's still something not quite right about that line. You might want to read it correctly, that would help. I don't see why you should object to an intelligent suggestion. I've written several important plays Miss Randall... one of them received the Pulitzer Prize. Have you written any plays? It's an old saying that you don't have to be a hen to know a bad egg. Now Miss Randall, it's nothing wrong with the play. I'll explain the scene to you once again. This woman's husband has decided to leave her and she's brokenhearted. Now, can you understand that? Yes, I can understand that but you told me to be light and sophisticated. On the surface. But inside, here, your heart is broken. The smile on your face, and you're crying in your heart. Well, I don't see how you can do two things at the same time... I refuse to sit quietly by and see my play butchered. Mr. Powell, as long as everyone around here... putting in their two cents worth somewhat promiscuously... I should like to remind you that I have a Broadway reputation to consider. I don't see what your Broadway reputation has... to do with what we're talking about, give me a light, will you? Miss Randall. I'll have to ask you to pay attention to the director. Oh, what am I supposed to do? Walk around like a puppet or use my intelligence? - You to do as you told. - Don't yell at me. I am yelling at you. If you think I'm so terrible, why you hire me for the part? That's what I'd like to know. Temporary insanity, probably. Now go ahead and do as you told. - Well, I... - Go ahead and do it. - I am doing it but... the only thing that I'd just like to make... - How long have you been coaching this girl? - I've only had her a month in. Better one, no one could possibly get that bad in a month's time. - Would you mind a suggestion? - Anything please. I was wondering, could you possibly see an older woman in the part? I don't know what I'm going to do. Where's this fellow Carmichael? I got to get out of this contract somehow. - He ought to be here any minute. - There he is now. Hello Mother hello Dad hello Kate. Calla lilies are in bloom again... - Hello Mr. Powell, how's everything going? - I got to get out of this contract. - I'm afraid that's impossible. - Who is this mysterious client of yours? - Head of some combine trying to ruin me? - Don't understand? When you listen to this rehearsal, you'll understand. Isn't she turning out as well as you expected? Oh, she may has possibilities, but right now she's a rank amateur. And as emotional as a fish, and she's a nuisance in the bargain. She questions everyone, the director, the writer, the actors. I don't see how this play is going to be anything but a flop. Is that so? - Well, you seem to be pleased about it. - Well, after all it's my client's money. But I told you I'd give you the money back... and son to win if you let me out of the contract. I'm sorry. Is your client by any chance in love with this girl? Well, to tell you the truth, I believe he is. Well, it takes all kinds of people to make a world. - Mr. Powell... - Coming, coming. I still don't understand anything he said... tells me to laugh and cry at the same time, I don't know what. - Well, that's plain to be seen. - Come on, let's get this organized. Go ahead and get it organized you know a puppet... Do you think my dress is fancy enough to wear opening night? For Randall's opening, you ought to wear black. Oh, she was nice enough to give us free tickets. She wanted to be sure someone was in the audience. Oh, the night was growing old. As she trudged through snow and sleet; And her nose was long and cold and her shoes were full of feet. Look, don't you like my dress? Don't you think it's pretty? Well, where you get that? Your mother send it from Louisiana? Oh yes, she makes all my clothes. - What are those things there, pecans? - No, just doodads. - Got to have 35 cents. - For what? - For Terry's flowers. - Don't make me laugh. Come on, cough up. We've only got 3 dollars and 85 cents, need as much as we can get. Alright, I'll give a dollar if it's for her funeral. She tries harder to hate people than anyone I know. - Here, keep the change. - Hey, wait a minute. You're so fond of feuds, you ought to live in the Kentucky mountains. Come on, we haven't got much time to eat. You got to stop at the florist in the way. This will be my 35th performance as spectator. Cheer up Mary Lou, someday the people on the stage will... sit and watch the audience and you'll be a sensation. So long string bean, I shall see you at the theater. Say, you're not going to catch the opening tonight, eh? No, I'm going tomorrow and catch the closing. You girl all talk as though you want her to be a flop. No exactly but as long as she's going to be a flop, I'm going to be there and see it. She's sore because Terry took my boyfriend away from her. - What do you mean boyfriend? - Tired little boyfriend. You know, someday I'm going to be lucky and run into you... when I'm carrying a bowl of goldfishes. Get me. Ain't I'm one? Look at her. Will you sew me into this? I'll get out about myself. - Gee, you look all dressed up. - I am dressed up. - Are you going alone? - Not Mackintosh, I got a beau. - Who? - The butcher's helper. He was little hard to break down but after I told him I had.., passes he nearly cut his thumb off in excitement. - Why can't I get a butcher? - Oh be still my heart, maybe that's him now. Hattie, this is your night, you got to make an entrance. - I'll get the door, you get out of here. - Hattie, have a heart. - Hello. - Hello, it's raining. - Oh, is that what it's doing? - Kind of wet. Yeah, rain usually is this time of year, Hattie will be right out. Hey Butch, I want you to meet Miss Farnsbarn, Miss Fannisbess Miss France and the stuff. - How do you know my name was Butch? - Oh Same way you knew is raining. Say Butch, it's something I want to talk to you about. You know, one of these days when Hattie comes down to market to get... some of that nice lamb, if your hand should put a little chicken... got in there of that lamb, girls isn't handsome? You know, you know, some people do things like... that for other people and other people do things like that... for some people, I think you should do it, don't you? Oh, why won't you come in and get the meat sometime? Oh, I will. You know, you know, I was downtown the other day, I was telling the girls that I saw... you standing by the window with your white coat on you were wonderful. I'd like to turn me back on you sometimes, you had a handful of knives. Butch is wonderful, he promised the next time you go shopping... get some chicken all mixed up in the lamb, right? - No, I didn't exactly. - No, no, no. - Come on, - Hattie don't do anything Butch wouldn't do. I'll do something for you sometime, I'll poison your soup. - Hey Butch, you got a friend? - I don't know. He said don't know. The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable for every occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now I... place them here in memory of something that is died. Cue from him, are you gathered here to mourn or you come... I thought I told you to rest. - Oh, I can't remember a line. - Of course you can't. Nobody can an hour before curtain time on opening night. When you put your foot on that stage, it'll all come back as if by magic. - Suppose they don't come back? - Oh, they'll come, somehow they all will. No, no Ann, I couldn't eat anything, thank you. You're sweet. Well, I'll leave the tea here. The calla lilies are in, I can't remember that. Calla lilies are in bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom. Such a strange flower... They seem to be useful on... I don't know what in the dickens they're useful on occasion. I'll never be able to remember, Kay? The doctor told you to stay in bed. I'm not going to stay in bed with all this excitement. But you mustn't disobey orders. I was to come and see you before I left. Keep her cheerful Kay, she's got first night nerves, you know, you've had them. I'm hurry along and get... - Your coat and galoshes are there. - Yes, thank you. - Kay, don't let her do any more rehearsing. - I'll sit on her. It would be raining in the bargain. It's, it's that first speech, if I could only get through that, I'd be all right. Would you mind watching, Kay? The calla lilies are in bloom again, such a strange flower, suitable to any... - May I make a suggestion? - I wish you would. The way you hold the flowers. I've always thought that Jeanette would hold them as she were a child. - They never had a child, you see and... - Oh, I see. You suppose that's what the author intended? I'm sure he did. And when she says, in memory of something that is died, she... Kay, you know this play. It's not a play, it really happened to someone I know. Darling, you mustn't do that. This isn't just your night, it's my night too. You got to be a success tonight. You got to give a great performance. - No matter what happens. - Is something the matter? No, I'm just excited, that's all. Here, you sit down and I'll get you some tea. That condemned woman drank a hearty supper. I felt the same way. Felt like running and hiding from everyone. But after that opening speech, there's a thrill you'll never forget. It's a thrill that only comes once. Thrill? I can't make out whether it's a thrill or agony. It's both. Aren't you ready yet? Come, we'll have to hurry. - Well, here I go. - The opening night, you know. Be quick dear. - Wish her luck, Kay. - Yes, I wish me luck. Goodbye. I want to give you this. A girl gave it to me last year on my opening night and it brought me luck. Darling, you're sweet. I wish you were going to be there to hold my hand. - I'll be there, in spirit. - Are you coming or are you not? Here she comes. - Good luck. - Goodbye Terry. Five minutes Miss Hamilton, five minutes, Everything is been fine. Places now, places please. Ready everybody, are you Miss Hamilton? It's a bought out house, everybody is out there, you haven't a thing to worry about. You ready now? - Stand by then please. - Ready Miss Hamilton? Did you hear that? That's all for you. This is your night. Who's that? Kay... she jumped before I could stop her. She lying out there, in the rain. Calling Car 19, calling car 19. Go to 87 West, 58th Street. Ambulance call. Girl leaped out window, possible suicide. Morris talking. - Good evening Mr. Powell. - Good evening. Well, looks like a packed house. It's because they don't know what's in store for them. Looks like the boyfriend. - Hey, this is a very bad place to stand. - Why? We're likely to be trampled to death when they start running out. Poor darling, you shouldn't have told her, she isn't responsible for Kay's act. She is responsible, was Kay's part, it was Kay's life. But now it's too late, Kay is dead. - Please? - Kay is dead. Kay, who never harmed anyone and... it's all because she hasn't a heart, because she's made out of ice. I can't listen to you anymore, you must leave. Oh, I'm leaving. I'm going to sit out front because Kay asked me to be there. And then every line she reads I'm going to say that should've been Kay's line. And every move you make, I'm going to say that should've been Kay. Kay, who's lying in a morgue all broken and alone. I dare you to go on tonight. I've got to get out of here, - I'm not going on. - You've got to go on. Why didn't someone tell me? I'd given up a thousand parts rather than have this happen. I'm going to go up and tell them I'm not going to go one, I'm going to tell them why. - I'll tell them. - You can't think only of yourself. Kay is dead, you had nothing to do with that. But there are 50 living people dependent on you. This show may mean as much to them as it meant to Kay. The ushers, the property men, the old women who clean out the theater. Each one of them has the right to demand that you give the best performance that you can. That's the tradition of the theater. No, hang the tradition of the theater, I'm thinking of Kay. Very well then, think of Kay. Do you going to let her down? You got to give the performance she wanted you to give. Then perhaps, wherever she is, you may bring her peace. Three minutes to curtain. - Miss Randall, three minutes to curtain. - Alright, we're coming, we're ready. Pick your exit, it won't be long now. Here she is now, coming up the garden path. - What are we going to say to her? - I don't know, no. The poor child, she's probably brokenhearted. You better let me talk to her first. Hello Mother hello Dad. The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower. Suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now... place them here, in memory of something that is died. - He needs a good thrashing. - You poor child. Have you gathered here to mourn or are you here to bring me comfort? How could a girl like you fall in love with a man like that? I've learned something about love that I never knew before. I never knew before. You speak of love when it's too late. Help should come to people when they need it. Why are we always so helpful to each other when it's no longer any use? Oh, my darling. - Those are not the lines. - No but it's the mood. This my home, this is where I belong. Love was in this house once... And for me it will always be here, nowhere else. - Surely you're not going to see him. - Of course, I'm going to see him. He's coming to me today to say goodbye. And one should always listen closely when people say goodbye. Because sometimes they're really saying farewell. Listen, I'm up at the theater in Powell's private office. Get a couple of photographers over here right away and don't argue with me. This Randall girl is going over big, hear the applause? You hear it? And wait till I tell you who she is boy, this is plenty hot. - Love comes back to its ancient dwelling. - The old, old love that we knew of yore. Terry Randall, what I say? Come on, come on. - Hold it, hold it. - Take a bow. - They're calling for you. - Who's calling for me? - You are a success darling. - They want a curtain speech. Yes, yes, go on. Say something. I suppose that I should thank you on behalf of the company. And I know that I'm grateful to you for your applause. But I must tell you that I don't deserve it. I'm not responsible for what happened on this stage tonight. The person you should be applauding died a few hours ago. A young and brilliant actress who could no longer find a spot in the theater. And it was for her, more than for anyone else, that I was able to go on. And I hope that wherever she is she knows... and understands and forgives. That's the oddest curtain speech I ever heard. - Hello, Powell. - Well hello, how you like the show? A little heavy but the girl is good. What in the name of time was that curtain speech all about? I don't know what it was about but she's a sensation and I just found something else. - So? - That guy with Carmichael is her father. And the laugh is on us. He's nobody but Henry Sims, the wheat king. - Wheat king? What a publicity hookup. - Don't worry, I spread it around. There's the old man now. Well Carmichael, why are you looking so blue? We've got a hit on our hands. - It's all I'm afraid of. - Well, I never doubted it. You permit it, you may Introduce me. - Oh yes Mr.Powell... - Glad to know you Mr.Sims. You didn't fool me, I knew who your daughter was all the time. To be honest Mr. Powell, this hasn't worked out the way I expected. Well, cheer up. Your investment will net you a quarter a million dollars. What good will that do me if I lose my daughter? Well, that's the price of success. Brent I forgot, get a big basket of flowers and send it... to Randall's dressing room right away, put this on top, hurry it up. - Shall I put a few sprigs of wheat in it? - Oh, mind the sarcasm, go on, hurry. Oh Elsworth, you're just the man I'm looking for. Well, I kind of put it over on the boys, didn't I? - You mean the wheat king's daughter? - Yes. She doesn't need that kind of publicity. - I know it, that's why I kept it quiet. - She has rather a strange quality. Reminds me very much of that girl you brought out last year. - Yes? - What was her name? - Oh, Hamilton, Hamilton. - Kay Hamilton, What ever happened to her? - She still around. - Strange quality? Don't forget to mention in your review that Randall is another Anthony Powell discovery. My dear, you'll never know how good you were tonight. You were simply wonderful. That wasn't me out there tonight, it was someone else. It's only after we have suffered, we can make the audience feel with us. Is someone have to die to create an actress? Is that what the theater demands? It takes more than greasepaint and footlights to make an actress. It takes heartbreak as well. Don't try to say anything, we'll go to her. - Where do you going? - We're going to see Kay. But you can't leave now, there are people here. The press, photographers. You're an actress now, you belong to those people. - May I come in? - You see them for me. But, Terry, I... - Hello, anyone there? - Coming coming, coming. Well, I thought you'd never let me in, where's the... - Where's Miss Randall? - She's gone. Gone? But I got an office full of people, reporters, society editors, photographers. Why didn't you keep her here? You know the theater better than that. Well, she had an important engagement she couldn't break. An engagement? What's more important than her career? Well, it isn't my fault. Of all the colossal nerve, I build a star overnight and she runs out on me... can you imagine that? I got an office full of people and she runs off somewhere... some kind of a date or something. Well, what I do with... I don't care what you do with them, get out of here. Wait a minute. Oh, imagine? Of all the colossal nerve. Take a woman out of a wheat field and make a star out of her. Well, I don't deserve any better. Opening night too, that's gratitude for you. Spent time and effort to build a production and they run out on you. I haven't any sense to begin with. Don't take it so hard Eve, it all may be a mistake. - I'll never put my trust in males again. - What's happened to Eve? She's brokenhearted, Henry is in the cat hospital. - An accident? - He just had a litter of kittens. Well, that's easy to solve, change his name to Henrietta. - I'm completely discouraged. - The miracle is happened. - Mary Lou is got a part. - No, where? Bergen's new show, the southern accent did it. I'm so thrilled I want to scream. - You feel better? - Read your part Mary Lou. Oh, I'm supposed to be a girl from the South and I'm with a lot of other girls... and I say, let's go up to Westchester. Go on. - That's it. - That's it? Well, you don't read it right, you should say, let's go up to Westchester. Oh no Jean, that's all wrong, you got to say, let's go up to Westchester. Let's go up to Westchester. Hey everybody, here comes that blushing bride. Oh, goodbye everybody, I got to catch a 6 o'clock train. Thanks for everything and the shower and all. If any of you hams happen to come to Seattle the house of Milbanks is always open to you. I thought the people there lived in trees. Only in the summer time, in the winter time, we live in burrows. Ok, she'll be right there. Your bridegroom won't hold that cab-taxi if you don't hurry. Well, goodbye everybody. Now that I'm going I feel like having a good cry. Say, you should weep, it's the first job you've had in a year. Sure, we all going to come to your wooden anniversary. Come on, heave. ♪ Here goes the bride, here goes the bride. ♪ Go back to Seattle, send us an old wooden shoe maybe. Poor kid, why she hated to leave a dump like this is a mystery. Oh, I know how she feels, to me it would be like leaving the house where I was born. Well, at least she'll have a couple of kids to keep her company in her old age. And what do we have? Some broken own memories and an old scrapbook which nobody will look at. - Not very different race of people. - Maybe. Tonight I feel like sitting out in the moonlight having somebody hold my hand. Good evening, who do I see about accommodation? Miss Orcutt... - She'll take care of you, come in. - Thank you. Hello? Hello Bill. Don't be sentimental, remember you're a ham at heart. No, it wasn't me, a friend of mine. How's the new job coming on? Would you like me to carry a message to your late lamented Aunt Susan? Hold on, gangrene just set in. No message, I don't use that kind of language. - Oh, I just thought I'd ask. - I just wanted to know if maybe... I think you'll be interested in this. It's one of the features of the Footlights Club. It's the chair Bernhardt sat in when she read Queen Elizabeth over here. I was in the company. I think you'll like it here, one great big family. I'll show you your room, I hope you don't mind sharing...
