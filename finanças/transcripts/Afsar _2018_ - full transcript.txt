(Prayers) (Prayers) (Prayers) "What have you done to yourself?" "Nothing is going to go with you." "What have you done to yourself?" "Nothing is going to go with you." Excuse me. I want to go to close by. Brother, I want to go to close by. Can you stop by at the bridge? I need to feed the fish. I will just come. I came on the scooter in a hurry. It would have been better if I'd come in a car. What's your name? It's okay. I'm Patwari Jaspal Singh. Myself Jaspal Singh. Kanungo. You've got a letter, Jaspal. - Hello, uncle. - Hello, son. You've got a letter. Sign here. Yes. Whose letter is that, Jaspal? Your son got appointed as Kanungo (revenue inspector), mother. Wonderful. - That's great news. - Brother became Kanungo. Well done, my boy. God bless you, son. That is amazing. - Mother, your grandson has become a Kanungo. - Okay. God bless you, son. I hope you soon end up being a Patwari (land clerk). - Mother. - There you go. It's a post higher than Patwari. - Really? - Yes. Kanungo is a rank higher than Patwari? Yes, mother. There are five Patwari under every Kanungo. Well done, my boy. You've made us proud. Indeed. God has answered our prayers today. Nimmi, go and get some jaggery from inside. Right away. Mother, we should get some sweets made. We need to distribute it in the neighborhood. Not just the neighborhood.. ..we will distribute it all across the village, sister. Fine, you can distribute it in the village. Brother, your first salary will come to me. I want sandals and hair accessories from Patiala. I've just become a Kanungo and not the Prime Minister. Go have some sweets. Here, have something sweet. God bless you, son. "Guru's words are.." Lord Almighty. Salary's 12000 rupees a month. It can even make a dead soul come to life. Get this straight, Jaspal. Our family might force you to get married and fulfill your responsibilities. But don't fall for it. We won't get into this mess for another few years. We'll go to Kulu Manali during summer vacation. And to Rajasthan during winter vacation. We'll go there for sure. At your expense. Well done. No? Shut up. Jaspal! - Hello, aunt. - Hello, aunt. Keep it with you. It's not hurting your shoulders. Hello, uncle. How are you doing, Jaspal? Good. How are you? Congratulations, son. You've become a senior officer. So, when are you going to join the duty? From next week. Well I was anyway going to meet your mother soon. I'll find a good match for you. That too from my in-laws' family. I have a niece there. She is very beautiful, tall and slim, just like an angel. She's quite pleasing to the eyes. That's excellent, aunt. That's what I have been telling him. It's the law of the nature, everyone has to settle down sooner or later. Don't do that. This what people who have nothing to do, do. We are responsible people. You are very smart. Where are you from? Chambali. - Oh my parents are from Tarkhari. - Great. Then you are like a family member to me. Talk to him. Look son, you don't get beautiful and educated girls quite so often. Trust me. Aunt, we trust you impeccably. Do you trust her? Yes. Whatever you two smart people think is right. But aunt, what if I could have a glimpse of her? Don't worry about it, son. I'll make an excuse and ask the girl to come to the Patiala market tomorrow. You can have a glimpse at her. Sure. When their match gets fixed, I'll be the first one to dance. - I don't think so. - What, I can't dance? Shut up. Can't you keep quiet? Son, your uncle is struck with a bad illness. He always coughs and sneezes together. Get good medicines. - Sunny, we have a 1960s' cycle. - Okay. - It doesn't work. - Hmm. But that too has a stand. Stand? Son, she is smarter and more beautiful than I told you. No one can find a better match for you than I will. Look, there she is. On the scooter. I don't want her to get suspicious. Take a good look at her. I'll get going. "When I looked at you, it touched my soul." "You have made me forget who I am." "I think I am in love." "I think fragrance of acceptance is in the air." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "My emotions are ruling me." "I spend nights staying awake because of you." "If you want, I can conquer the world." "There is a reason everyone talks about me." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You look like a heavenly angel." "You make my heart move like the rapid waves." "Even the moon will bow when it will see us together." "Then you will see light keeping the evil away from us." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You look like a heavenly angel." "You make my heart move like the rapid waves." "Your beauty will get adorned with love." "Then see how henna adds to your beauty." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." "You read books with my names on them." "And I keep filling registers with our love." Honestly speaking, you have unburdened me. Look, if you hadn't insisted, he would have wasted another a few years. Brother, you should know how to make the camel sit. That's true. Brother, you better gave me your next few salaries. I have to buy a lot of things for the wedding. Why would I give you my salary? Hear her talk. Aunt, brother told me that he doesn't like the girl. What? No aunt, she is lying. I like her a lot. Why are you troubling your brother, girl? Kashmiro, they are kids. But you are a mature adult. You make the girl stand before Jaspal? No aunt, I didn't. I showed her to him from a distance. As if that is a good thing. Listen to her. Times have changed, mother. Nowadays they make both the girl and the boy face to face and let them talk. Well, she comes from a good family. She has a government job. They wanted her husband to be a government servant as well. So, I thought this would be perfect. Aunt, let's not waste time talking. We have accepted this match. You should talk to them. Right, brother? Perfect, little brother. Sister-in-law, do whatever you need to do. Don't worry. I will get the work done. Brother-in-law is here! Oh good. - They are here. - The boy is here. Welcome. Hello. - Hello. - Welcome. We feel blessed with your presence. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, sir. - Hello. He is her uncle. And she is her mother. Hello. Welcome. Please come in. How are you? Good. Sister, I'm sure to get this alliance fixed. Sister, your daughter is very beautiful. Beautiful? I think her name is beautiful as well. Harman. Our daughter knows all the household chores. Right. Jaspal.. Even Rajjo manages the household chores. Isn't she good? I've left her for you. Sister, household chores can be handled. We want someone who mingles well with the family. Don't worry, sister. Our daughter is very friendly in nature. What's your education qualification? I've a bachelor's degree in arts and education. If both of them are government servants then nothing is out of reach for them. Son, how many more brothers and sisters do you have apart from Guddi? Friends are also like brothers. Okay. I'm her only brother. I'd kept you here. Right here. That's why you are wearing my shoes. Stop your nonsense. They are mine. Brother, do you handle the fields yourself or have you given it on contract? No, we've not given in on contract. We handle it ourselves. How much land do you have? With God's grace my father has 60 acres of land.. We both brothers get 30 acres each. - Very good. He's generous. - Yes. I can't see her father around. Brother, he's gone to the village. He had some important work. We'll ask him to come back. Shera. Yes, uncle? Go and call your father from the village. Okay. There a land distribution going on. Okay. He'll be hanging out with the Patwari over there. Okay. He'll be back soon. Imported liquor should be had with soda. And here I am drinking with plain water. It's okay if you cannot provide soda. You should have at least offered onions with it. We've kept a sack full in your car, Patwari. You don't need to worry for another month and a half. It's not as if it will fan me. I was wondering what kind of news wheels are these? That's right. Honestly speaking only three people in Patiala district have these. Really? SDM sir. RK Mittal, grocer. And the third one is Bharpur Singh. That's great. They are quite shiny. They are worth 15,000 rupees. - They are called alloy wheels. - Okay. - Patwari sir? - Yes? Please complete the documentation and set me free. You are strange, boy. Patwaris will die of starving if Jatts stay free. I mean let's go home after finishing this. I'll make arrangements for you at home. Fine, I'm coming along to see what arrangements you've made. Let's go, sir. Please come with me. Let me see how well you serve me. Help me with my shirt, my boy. Here you go. - Carry that. - Right away, sir. Let's go. Move it to the left or the path will get crooked. This is a limit. Hold this map. Gather the measuring tape. Gather it. Give it to me. What's wrong, Patwari sir? What else could go wrong? It won't make any difference to you. But it will make a big difference to your grandson. You are calling me your friend? Were you my classmate? People like me don't befriend ordinary people. We only befriend money. Get lost from here. You can convince God with sweets. But Patwari isn't so easy to convince. Daddy, the groom's family is home. Go and stand near the scooter, son. Okay Patwari sir, allow me to leave then. We have guests to meet our daughter at home. He's from your department. He's a Kanungo. They say it's a post above Patwari. They aren't proper. When someone gives a box of mangoes.. ..it's for Patwari to decide.. ..whether Kanungo will get one mango or two. If a Kanungo is standing before him, he questions.. Are you here for the mangoes? An officer should behave like an officer. Yes, an officer should behave like an officer. I never said an officer should behave like a wrestler. Salary alone is not enough for an officer like to fuel up my car. An officer earns through the extra income. Come and have a closer look at my car's tyres. They are high a wrestler's thighs. I don't let any of them burn out. I get new tyres as soon as they burn out. Look at tread marks of my tyres. If my car passes through dung then the value of dung increases. It compresses it flat. No one can compete with a Patwari. If a Patwari taps a buffalo.. ..she gives 2 litres extra milk and 5 kilos of extra dung. Sir, your daughter is well educated and has a government job. You should find a suitable match for him. It doesn't matter even if he is 5-10 years elder than her. Well, it is the duty of a smart person to make you understand. I've given you a clue. I hope you have understood. Bye. Stop, stop, stop. - Billa.. - Yes, daddy? Does that car belong to the groom? Yes. Very small tyres. They aren't even properly fit. Even the dung must be cursing its fate. By the grace of God. Yes, that's true. - There he is. - I'll take these shoes back today. Brother's here . Brother, they are here with a marriage proposal for Harman. Hello. - He's the father and he's his uncle. - Hello. - He's the prospective groom. - Hello. He's a Kanungo. Kanungo. He wouldn't be bowing down if he were a Patwari. Bhola! It's our turn to take the water today. Harman.. Please go inside dear. Start preparing the dinner. Brother. Are you fine, sister? Let's go, my dear. He's always like that. How's your husband? Everyone's fine, brother. He wants respect. Brother. But you get respect only if you have a stature. If he has some effect. If he has something in him. What are you saying, brother? He is an officer. Hear that. They are addressing a Kanungo as an officer. Brother, you address a Patwari as an officer. Who knows what Kanungo is. Brother, five Patwaris work under a Kanungo. That's what I am saying, sister. All five of them make good money. - And Kanungo doesn't get anything. - Listen. - Wait a minute. - What's your salary? 12000, all inclusive. 12000. People who move around spend more than that on fuel. Listen to me. Wait, let me talk to him. Have you ever milked a buffalo? Tell me. Keep quiet. How do you do it? Tell me. You sit down and do it. If a Patwari hits a buffalo, she starts giving milk on her own. That's how much respect he commands. People bow down with respect before Patwaris for a reason. Few respect those who make money through illicit means. Everyone respects and hugs an honest person. Fine then.. hug me and then leave. You can come back once you become a Patwari. This road leads to the market. This is a limit. Let's go, Sukhdev. That's enough. - Let's go, everyone. Let's go home. - Uncle. Listen. - Listen, son. - Let's go, son. - You stop them, sister. - What can your sister do? It was such a good match, but he ruined everything. Stop them. You're losing such a good prospect. Think about Harman. Listen.. My daddy is very stubborn in nature. Once he is decides something he doesn't let go of it easily. You please don't mind about what he said. I am not upset. But this is the first time I am insulted like this. That's why it feels sad. I wanted to ask you something. Can't you take up the post of Patwari somehow? I have worked hard to become a Kanungo. Then work a little harder. Right, Pali? You might perhaps be get posted as a Patwari. Tell me something, I know I can work harder and get a better ranking post. But how I work harder and get a lower ranking post? Actually.. When you came to see me at the market for the first time.. I saw you as well. I don't know how to say it.. ..but I liked you. That's the time when I decided.. ..that this is the girl who would be my wife. Boy was really good. I think they made a good pair. What can we do, sister-in-law? Brother isn't going to agree. He is stuck at marrying her to that Patwari. Honestly speaking I don't like him at all. He's a drunkard. The whole world drinks these days. There is no doubt that that boy is better.. ..than Patwari Bharpur Singh in every which way. But if you see from brother's point of view.. ..then Bharpur's Singh's proposal isn't bad either. I think so too. Why cause a fight at home? He isn't going to agree anyway. It's not as if he doesn't love her.. ..that he won't think about what's right for Harman. Fine.. And I agree with brother on this. No one can compete with the respect a Patwari commands. We have a good daughter. And good children never say no to their parents. Why do you worry about her? Jaspal? Your dinner's getting cold. Son, I think they don't deserve to be our relative. There is no shortage of marriage proposals for you. There are many more girls. Tell me something, do you start your job from tomorrow? Yes. From tomorrow. Then like a good boy, you should start your job from tomorrow. - Yes. - Be brave. Okay? I'm Patwari Jaspal Singh. Myself Jaspal Singh. Kanungo. Hail. Hail. Hail. For whose dead soul is it? My father passed away. Oh okay. I got his job. My uncles forced me to take his place. I want to leave my job. Jagdish, a priest from Raikot said.. ..that if feed the fishes for seven days, my wish will come true. That's a nice wish you have. I'm not interested in doing small government jobs. Then what are you interested in? I'm a man of principles. What are the principles of your life? I have a simple principle: The one who serves me a local brand is my brother. And the one who serves me an imported brand is my father. Daddy, I think you should order for four eggs, scrambled. Six eggs, scrambled, for sir. Daddy, tell me something, how will you benefit by offering me liquor? You should just assume that from today he is Patwari Jaspal Singh. Huh?! What do you mean? What will you do if you get 20,000 rupees? At one go? At one go. There is a direct bus to Shimla from Chandigarh. It's fun to get drunk there. I won't come back till I don't run out of money. And what if you keep getting more money there? Then I won't be coming back till I'm not dead. Give him the cash. 20,000 rupees. Give me the documents. Oh yes. Here's my Identity Card. And that's the joining letter. And these are the rest of the government documents. - Let's go already. - Wait. You'll get the rest of the money there. Okay. Fine. There you go, Jaspal Singh. You've managed to become a Patwari. Now it's my job. I know someone important. He's my friend. He'll make such an Identity card that even the judge.. ..of the supreme court won't be able to prove it as fake. Did you get on it? Hold these bottles. Bye, daddy. Goodbye, uncle. Jaspal won't be coming back now. My 20000 has got four zeros. I've come across many idiots, Sunny. But I've never come across such an idiot. But.. I didn't get you. "We can sell a fight." "We can sell souls." "If needed.." "We can even sell honor." "We rule over those.." "..who rule others." "Kanungo doesn't stand.." "Kanungo doesn't stand a chance." "When he has to compete with a Patwari." "Patwari sir!" "People might fight with their brothers, but never with us." "People might fight with their brothers.." Show me your hands. You want to kiss them? Not, I want to cut them. Where's the photo? I told you he is of no good. Rectify it. I'll rectify it right away. Give me just two minutes. "We are no one's friend or enemy." "We are no one's friend or enemy." "Kanungo doesn't stand a chance." - What happened? - I have an uncle.. "Kanungo doesn't stand a chance." "When he has to compete with a Patwari." "Everyone fears us.." Thank you, uncle. "Even the big shots." "The whole world knows.." "About the power a Patwari holds." "Patwari sir!" "I want to click a picture of us.." "With my hand on your shoulder." There is a letter for you from the Tehsildar's office. Couldn't you cough before you came? What's the use of doing it now? Give it. I think it's her letter. "Kanungo doesn't stand a chance." "When he has to compete with a Patwari." "Kanungo doesn't stand a chance." "When he has to compete with a Patwari." "Patwari sir!" "Patwari sir!" "Patwari sir!" We managed to get rid of this obstacle somehow, Jaspal Singh. Now I hope now other obstacle blocks the path. "Not everyone can become Jogga sir.." "Everyone family has a son, Jogga.." "Jogga, it's time to go to school." How are you, Lala (Grocer)? - Good. - All good, Heeriya? I'm all good. You tell me, how's schooling treating you? I'm having a good time. During the day I turn my students into chicken And at night, I cook chicken. Masterji (Teacher), why do you trouble yourself by transporting milk? Why don't you stick to your job? I have to pay the installments for the motorbike also, you see. I just need to collect milk on my way here. It's not a big deal. And I also get to meet my school's parents. It keeps the score settled. Great. Why are you wasting time teaching Punjabi. You should be teaching accountancy, Jogga. Hey! You should keep the drums out of the way. Useless people. You don't know this Rocky goon. I thought only my buffalo kicks a lot. There are others who have their animals roaming freely. Masterji, we have a new generation of goons in our village. It's okay. Let Jaila come back from his term in prison. You'll all start hiding in your burrows. Forget them. Is she wooed? Did you talk to her? It's work in progress. I've brought fresh juice for her. Fresh. Stay strong. Let me know if you need my help. What, do you want to be my best man at our wedding? You can dance with the rest of the guests. Goodbye, Lala. Keep my drums clean, I'll take them in the evening. Oh, sure. Hello, Masterji. Why don't you address me as sir instead of Masterji? Here's fresh juice. Thank you, Masterji. Don't make me slap you. It is not for you. It is for Harman madam, you idiot. You need to clean it and hang it back on my bike, okay? By the way.. Harman madam hasn't come to school as yet? No, she hasn't. How can she? One heart calls out to the other. Absolutely. Till Sir Jogga Singh doesn't stand on the school gate.. ..and pull the strings, how can Harman madam leave her house? Now see. Here's Sir Jogga Singh's pulls the first string. Harman madam has felt the pull at home. Harman madam is moving towards her scooter. She just pushed the self-start button with her delicate thumb. But this stubborn won't accept innocent self-starts. They don't. Then Madam Harman thought about Sir Jogga Singh.. ..and tried to kick start the scooter. Do you here the engine? Yes, I did. There she leaves from her house. She gave a lift to Bholi. And.. Following the flow of the winds, to the school she sings.. "Pull me into the courtyard by holding my hand." "Pull me in, Master!" Masterji, Shindi is cursing me? What else do you expect? Don't make me hit you. Get lost. Harman madam just passed by. Now don't make me hit you. Are you blind? He knew, and you didn't know that Harman madam just passed by. I can't help it, Masterji. I was having such a good time. I had closed my eyes. Oh eyes! I'm going blind in love and he's the one who can't see anything. I'll give you a tight slap. Class stand up. Jai Hind. Good morning, sir. Good morning, good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, Masterji. - Good morning. All the kids are here today. Everyone in the world has had kids, we just need to have a few. What? I mean I think there are a few short. But the class is almost full. Yes. Would you like some tea, sir? No, forget the tea. I've brought fresh juice for you. - Okay. - Yes. Continue studying. - Get the juice, Suresh. - Coming. Raju, go and call Bholi madam. She will have some juice. What will Bholi do with it? It's fresh juice. Do you need to give it to staff who is on probation? It's okay. She'll have some. Don't walk over the plants. Walk from outside. Be polite, Masterji. With politeness, you can win over anyone. Really? I too want someone to win me over with love. But I have no control. What, sir? I said, your juice is here. - Drink it. - Okay. Hello, Masterji. This is fresh juice. Yes, it's available in the market as well. It's fresh. See. She drank it. Masterji, you should have added some lime juice to it. The lemon plant is right there. You can pluck whatever size's lemon you want. Those lemons? They are raw. And you too are on probation. When two permanent staff are having a conversation.. ..temporary staff shouldn't interfere. Please drink it. Have it. You shouldn't lock horns with Bholi. She is headwoman's granddaughter. If she is headwoman's granddaughter then I am a government officer. Let me see who dares to mess with me. Bihar's government chances. People expect financial conditions to improve. Really? And what's the financial conditions of Punjab? Where's the Patwari's office, brother? I'll tell you. Cross the roundabout to the left side there is a board. Behave yourself and tell us in Punjabi. Do you think we have come from Bangladesh? He's from Bihar, we aren't. Like the elders say, pray to keep Patwari and illnesses away. Sometimes I feel like holding the Patwari through his neck and drowning him. They won't move from their chair until bribed. Move aside, we'll find it on our own. No, no, no. I'm not talking in Hindi anymore. Hear me out. Whether or not your job is done.. ..but please do something for me. On the walls of the Patwari office you should write bad words. Here's a piece of coal for you. Why do you need to write the bad words? He's right in front of you. Go ahead, cuss him. You stupid, he's the new Patwari. We've never met before. You and your damned financial conditions. He is a Patwari. Even the DTO doesn't dare to compete with him. What about some fresh cold milk? Why do we need anything cold? You just offered us fresh hot cusses. I've learn something about you. You are biggest idiot in the village. Even if you had a death wish, you wouldn't speak to a Patwari in this way. Go and continue playing. Go and play. Patwari sir, I could have taken you there. This road will lead you there. But he is in a car. There is something called as responsibility as well. There you go, Patwari. Make a choice. You can choose the wall and I'll choose the cusses. Choice. Very good. He wants to do IELTS? There you go, your friend has ended up being demoted from Kanungo to Patwari. By the way, you shouldn't take such decisions because of a woman. We might get caught. How can I help you? He's the new Patwari, Jaspal Singh. Okay. Hello, sir. I am Charan Singh. I got the letter from the department that you'll join today. Welcome, sir. Let me show you the office. I had cleaned up your office. The fan is rusty so we got the wires disconnected to avoid an accident. But I'll get it remembered soon. Doesn't Patwari's office have a telephone connection? No sir, they are not provided with a phone. How else can I help you, sir? Would you like some tea? Yes, get some tea. And fritters too, of cauliflower. Okay. Not too crisp. Sir, no sweets? You'll get sweets later. First let us go see the one we are here for. Let's go. Come on. That way? That's why my calculations suggest. But the wall is too high. There you go, Patwari. I think God has answered your prayer. I think He has answered someone else's prayer as well. Oh my.. I don't mind getting caught for this beauty queen. Sister-in-law is looking more beautiful than that day. Move back. It's Bholi. And she's your sister-in-law. Then where's your sister-in-law? "I think I am in love." "I think I have lost my peace of mind." "I think I am in love." "I think I have lost my peace of mind." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think I am in love." "These mesmerizing eyes enslave me with the tresses." "I think she is from where Heer was born." "I think she is from where Heer was born." "I think I time has stood still." "I think I time has stood still." "I think I am in love." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think I am in love." The marriage proposal we had got from Amritsar? That boy has become a Patwari now. How can he become a Patwari? The earlier officer has recommended him. If you say so, I will reinitiate the talks. Your wish. "She is the one I see everywhere, like a bright light." "Her brightness rules my thoughts too." "Her brightness rules my thoughts too." "Even summers feel like winters." "Even summers feel like winters." "I think I am in love." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think I am in love." "I talk to myself." "I keep counting stars at night." "I too have started behaving like the ones in love." "I too have started behaving like the ones in love." "I think someone's become a part of my life." "I think someone's become a part of my life." "I think I am in love." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think someone has stolen my heart with a glimpse." "I think I am in love." What do you say, Master? What do I say, aunt? Actually, times are so bad that.. ..you shouldn't let your girls out of the house alone. I say forget them going to work. It is better to keep the girls at home. Why? What are you talking about? How do I say it? Look, I am talking about Bholi. She is like a little sister to me. But this world is cruel, sister. What do I say? No one in the village would dare look at my granddaughter. What do I say now? As they say no one observes the unobvious. You know the new Patwari who had joined the office? - The tall man with twisted moustache? - Yes. He has set his eyes on Bholi. He writes letters to her. Thankfully, I got hold of a letter so I brought it to you. I haven't told anyone in the village about it. You can read it for yourself. As they say, the truth cannot be hidden for long. The proof is right in front of you. When we learnt that you've become a Patwari.. ..we thought we should go and congratulate you. Yes. Son, circumstances make you behave differently. Our family has made a very big mistake. That's why we have come to apologize. You also say. You can ask your father if you wish to go ahead with the marriage proposal. Come on, what do you mean by if you wish to go ahead? Of course, we should. Don't worry, son. We will talk to your father. Listen girl, don't get the milk. Master is leaving. Listen up, if this happens to be true then Patwari is done for. If this is a lie then you are done for. No, why would it be a lie? If it is then I'll be the one who will get beaten up, right? Now, the village council will decide that. True. All I want to say is that.. I didn't write this letter to Bholi. We will come to that point later. You just tell me, is this your handwriting. Yes, it is. There you go. There the topic ends. Grandma, I address Jaspal brother as brother. And he is supposed to marry Harman. Yes. Yes, it is a conspiracy against Jaspal. Listen up, girls. Girls shouldn't interfere in the council's decision. Keep quiet, dear. Don't say anything. You cheated your friend. I'd kept you here. Right here. Forget the rest, give me my belt back. Don't make me hit you with my shoes. Behave yourself. And the belt belongs to me. Brother, is it true that your daughter is about to marry that boy? Yes, sister. We are planning to get them married. But this boy cannot make such a big mistake. He is from an affluent family. People from affluent families are the ones who behave like this. Poor people think twice even to look at their own wives. You were praising his family, right? There, he has proven how good he is. What you need to think that she is headwoman's granddaughter. I wonder what would have done if she was from a poor family. Are you sure? I wonder what this sinner would have done if she was from a poor family. Look, I'd request everyone that the guilty should be punished.. ..irrespective of the fact that he is a Patwari. Okay? This boy has some information. You tell them. He will be surely punished. This child has something to say. Please listen to him before you take any decision. Yes son, tell us. Whenever Masterji wants to beat us up or punish us.. ..he uses his right hand's little finger's nail to scrape and change the alphabet. You can check, he has grown his right hand's little finger's nail. - Nonsense. - Go and check. Okay. Get your hand out of the pocket. It's grown. In the letter too, alphabets have been scraped and changed to Bholi Actually, I have a request to make. My right hand's little finger is quite an imp. Whenever it feels like, it starts scraping things. Then I am forced to write in place of that. I apologize to the council on behalf of my little finger. Stop your nonsense, Master! If you ever step your feet back in this village again.. I'll break your knees. Look I am a government appointed schoolteacher. So, I'll have to go to the school. I cannot teach the students over the phone. Okay, you can go to the school but not to the village. Look, the council cannot interfere in government matters. I'll go to the school. You can keep your foot down in the school and not in the village. Watch out. So, does this decision apply from today itself? Not from today, from right away. Okay, I am leaving. My motorbike's over there. I'm leaving. Move. Don't block the way. That's a good decision. Listen, villagers. This boy shouldn't step in the village. Well, you should stick to your principles.

Masterji, come over. You come here, brother. Tharkhardi village starts from here. If I my feet touch the ground there, they will kill me. Get back. - Come here. - Okay. Let's go. This is a limit. Earlier, I didn't let the villagers look up at me.. ..and now they don't even let me keep my feet down. But don't you think 500 rupees is too less, Masterji? I'll slap you. I wouldn't let someone like you wash my motorbike.. ..and yet I've allowed you to ride it. Your only job is to make sure that my feet don't touch the ground. But who will open the school then? If they do a surprise visit then I'll lose my job. You won't lose your job. I deliver 3 litres whole milk every morning to the DO. - That too free of charge. - Okay, Masterji. Then give me 1 litre milk every day as well. Fine, I'll add another litre of water in it. - It contains just 9 litres anyway. - Sure? I fixed Mitthu's alliance. Someone has to take the responsibility. You see. How are you, Lala? Good. Why are you taking the trouble, Master? Keep your feet down. The stick will hit the knees badly. Join the knees and hit, he will scream like a baby. Shame on you, Heeriya. You too are behaving like other villagers? Masterji, our friendship has nothing to do.. ..with my responsibility towards the village. Heera Singh will support his village. Then I too don't need to keep my feet down. I've arranged a driver for myself. Master, there is less fat in your milk these days. Lala, there is a lot of fat in you. You should mix some in the milk. - Masterji is here. - Get down now. Noorie. Look there, masterji. Masterji, who are they laughing at, me or you? I don't know. I lost the girl as well as my honor. Hey! Thoosa? Did you break that? Did you do it? Heeriya, I heard Jaila is coming back on Monday. Yes, he will be released on Monday. That's why everyone in the village is scared. I hope Jaila's stay here is uneventful this time. Jaila is tough. He starts a conversation with a cuss and ends it with a bullet. Yes, he only listens to the headwoman. He doesn't fear anyone in the village. There's a reason why people quiver at mere mention of my name. You at home, aunt? Come on in, Jaila. I am here. I thought I should pay you a visit. Come in. I seek your blessings. God bless you. Bless me. Go inside, dear. No girl, you don't need to fear me. You are my daughter and I am your brother. For everyone else in the village, I'm their son-in-law. - Boys, she is our sister. - Okay, brother. Sit down, dear. Jaila, your term in prison is over? - No, another three years to go. - Okay. - I've got 15 days' leave. - Okay. Tell me, do you want to get someone killed? Damn you. I want to get you back in track and you talk to me about killing people? Mindo, go and get buttermilk for them. Add ice in it. Do you get buttermilk there? What are you saying? Spend a month with me in the prison.. ..and you will see how well they take care of both of us. You want me to go to prison at this age? You have no control over your tongue or your head. Aunt.. I can come here joke around with you. Otherwise, I'll scare the wits out of the villagers. Uncle brother.. Sweety is the only sister of you four brothers. She is five years elder than me. Why don't you think about her? Stupid girl. She says we don't think about her. Just yesterday, we got her 15 kilos of the best piece of mutton. It had filled such a big jar. Don't you think that's enough for her? Stupid buffoon, she is talking about getting her married. You should worry about getting her married. Why should we worry, aunt? When brother Jaila will aim his 12-gauge shotgun at someone.. People will start throwing groom's across the wall for us. There, we can get Sweety married 15th time. 15th time! The Sweety will need to be widowed 14 times to get married the 15th time. Look at him talk. Beauty! Yes? See if there is a dog barking on the street. Stop troubling me. As it is, the power cut has got me irritated. Power cut? Aunt, I'll get it restored right away. Let's go, boys. Let's pay a visit to the electricity department first. Let's go. Tell me about it. I'll be back later, aunt. - Hey, get some buttermilk for Jaila. - Right away, sir. - Add ice. - Yes. Hello, brother Jaila. Heeriya, you are still alive? Sinners like me don't die an easy death. When I die, I'll take at least four along with me. - One. - Two. - Three. Who are you talking about? That was a wrong count. It was a co-incidence that it matched with yours. And I kill people for much less, co-incidentally. See, he got scared. Go and sit down over there. JE, keep your leg down. Jarnail Singh.. Barrack three in Nabha Jail is excellent. I swear.. it is quite breezy in there. Look at him talk. Have you ever been to Nabha Jail? Like hell he's been to Nabha Jail. If there is a clash in the village, he gets beaten up right here. Heard that? Where's the buttermilk I asked for? Changing the topic? How many times have I told you to keep the barrels.. Who is it? This barrel was rolling away. Hello, brother. Who are you? I'm Rocky. What is wrong with your hair? Did you get an electric shock? No, brother. I got them styled, in the city. - Stand up. - I thought I should too. Brother Jaila.. Let's go home quickly. Slow down. What's wrong? Sweety consumed poison. What? Your Sweety consumed poison, brother. Poison? Sweety! Keep quiet! She isn't dead as yet. How many pills did she take? I think one. Did she chew it or swallow it? It was solid. She wasn't patient. She added to the mutton and ate it. Let's go. Stand up. If we face any more power cuts, you'll face a power surge. Move aside. Get up, doctor. Sweety, my sister. Brother, she had consumed a lot of poison. We saved her with great difficulty. Doctor, take the life I have left and save my sister. She won't survive more than three minutes with your life. Listen to him talk. Monty! Shut up! Sweety, tell me, when you have four brothers.. ..why did you need to consume poison? Why are you signing? Speak up. Poison's bitterness her twisted tongue. She cannot talk anymore. Oh. But doctor, then how will we learn why did she consume poison? Sweety, write and tell them. How can she write when she never went to school? Okay then, just sign it. What is wrong with you, Sweety? Brother, she has indigestion. She is saying she is feeling uneasy. Brother, she is talking about something related to heart, love? Okay. She is our sister. And you know her signs better? Sukhi, come out with me. I want to talk to you. - I want to ask you something. - Yes. Tell me the truth. She is your best friend. I am sure she must have told you something. Brother, she consumed poison because of a boy. She said that her beloved has left her. She had a boyfriend? And I was unaware about it? Tell me his name. I'll kill him. Boys! Search both heaven and earth. Find the boy.. ..who has hurt my sister's feelings. Search the entire house. Search the entire house. Any letter, inland letter, telegram or a ring with a boy's name on it.. Find it. Go! 'Jaila.' - Where did you find this? - From your room. Great. I've been searching for it since so many years. A memento of my love. Kashmiro had given it. Sukhi's aunt. Kashmiro was special. Why are you staring at me? Go inside and find the evidence. Go! - Did you find anything? - Nothing. - I too didn't find anything. - You neither? Why do you have flour on your face? Did you go in there to find evidence or to cook? Idiots. I'll slap you till you turn black and blue. After all this is Sweety's love story. There has to be evidence. Find it. Go! Why are you staring at me? Whoever you are.. Jaila will chop you into small pieces. Find the evidence. Brother Jaila! Brother Jaila! We have found this camera which aunt from London had sent us. We will surely find something in here. She has no shame. Enjoy the sweets. The one whose boyfriend is Jaspal Patwari doesn't need to feel scared. Who is Jaspal Patwari? Brother, he is the one who is working at as Patwari in our village. Naughty, Monty, Beauty! Remember one thing. None of you will touch him. I'll strangle him myself. What are you saying, brother? My biceps are flaring. Then let's handle you first. We can handle him later. Jaspal Patwari! Jaila is coming for you. He came even here. Okay, so it's him? You go inside. So you dared to romance with Jaila's sister. - Should I kill you right away? - Brother? Brother, please don't interfere. Let me talk to the Patwari. I am Patwari Jaspal. Then brother, you should move aside. Jaspal, you made my sister feed you sweets sometimes. And sometimes you fed sweets to my sister. And yet you thought you could escape me? No, my dear. Monty! Start counting. One, two, four. No, one, two.. Okay, that's why you didn't like the sweets I had made. You used to let others feed you sweets. Monty! When will you reach the count of ten? Brother Jaila, I can't count beyond five. Brother Jaila, death would be a very simple punishment for him. Give him a bigger punishment. I think instead of shooting him with a bullet.. ..you should shoot your sister at him. Which Sweety are you talking about? I don't know any Sweety. Don't refuse to accept it now. The one who refuses to accept is a liar. First prove that I'm guilty that too in front of someone responsible. I doubted you from the very beginning. Bholi used to tell me that Patwaris are untrustworthy. Bholi.. even their friends are untrustworthy? They are stupid. And Harman is smart schoolteacher.. ..and not some temporary help you can fool easily. Yes. If this is true then I'll do something worse than you did. But only if this was true. Listen.. I won't let you two talk anymore. Now decision will be made in front of the headwoman. Let's go. Look son, Sweety will decide your fate. If you are guilty then you will have to marry her. I'll marry her. But she should first say so. I don't even know her. Call her, where is she? Wait, she is coming. Then why are all of you already here? I don't understand your village. As if you don't have anything else to do. You call for a council meeting every second day. Where's Sweety, brother? There she is. Oh my! God, why don't You let such accusations be made on me? I don't deserve such an accusation. Are you feeling better, dear? Why did you have to do this? Look at her, she has shrunk to half. If she is half then we are a quarter. You won't stop joking will you? Don't worry, aunt. We will get two goats' meat for Sweety this time. Oh Lord Almighty. Sweety, my child, you don't need to feel pressurized. You don't need to feel scared of anyone. Just sign in a yes or a no. Did you consume poison because of him? 'Where will you find such a Jaspal again, Sweety?' 'That Jaspal was odd looking.' 'Don't let go of such a handsome man.' Sweety, my dear, sign a yes or a no. There you go. Decision has been made. I don't even know her. She is lying. Oh, I see. So she is lying. That day you kept feeding her sweets. And today you say that you don't even know her? That's it, aunt. No need for the wedding. I'll shoot him and end this topic right away. Shut up, you stupid buffoon. Get them married first thing tomorrow morning. Until then keep both the Patwari and his sidekick.. ..locked up in the Patwari Office. No one should enter or leave this village. Close all telephone lines of this village.. ..so that no one tries to interfere in our village's matter. And place a few men to keep a watch on them. Harman? I don't even know that girl. I don't know why am I being falsely accused of this. This is a limit, Harman. I'm being wrongfully trapped into this. Oh really, you are being wrongfully trapped? Yes. Your false arguments are of no use now. Your crime has been proven in front of the entire village. Okay then.. Now at the same time, at the same place.. ..I'll marry the one who wants to marry me. Harman.. Uncle, send him a message.. He should come here with his wedding guests. "I can't live without you." - "You know I won't remain alive." - Harman. "I can't live without you." "You know I won't remain alive." "Don't trouble me so much." "That I forget to smile." "Don't make me cry so much." "That I forget to smile." "That I forget to smile." "I will die without you." "God knows what I will do." "I will die without you." "God knows what I will do." "Don't go far away from me." "That sorrows wash me away." "That sorrows wash me away." "Don't make me cry so much." "That I forget to smile." "That I forget to smile." Come on, come on, passengers for Tharkhardi. Passengers for Tharkhardi please get down. - Hurry up. - I am getting down. Stop pushing me. He behaves like a Patwari. No one will even appoint you as a watchman in the village. Beggar dreams of being the king. Get lost. You illiterate it's Veerbhadra. You'd know only if had ever been to Shimla. Let's go, brother. - They show up shamelessly. - Idiot. - Hello. - Hello. Where's the Patwari's Office? Close to the High School, next to the temple. It's quite hot in your village. - Well, it's summer time so.. - What time? I think he has come down from Shimla. As if he is the only one who feels the heat. You should keep it clean as you carry it. Strange, there is security in the Patwari's Office as well? Where to? Inside. Patwari's Office is closed today. I think you are having a bad day.. ..because you aren't letting a Patwari enter his office. I told you, Patwari's office is closed. Patwari has gone for a holiday. He was on a holiday. He is back now. Have you seen your face in the mirror before calling yourself a Patwari? Get lost from here. Jaspal? Don't make me break your neck. I'm going, brother. Why are you doing this? - I'm leaving. - Patwari! What are you doing here? See, he recognized me. You didn't send me 20,000 rupees. I don't have the money. Oh I see! You were making tall claims back then. I'll tell everyone in the village that I am the real Patwari.. ..and you have made fake documents to take my place. Right, perhaps that will make the villagers give you 20,000 rupees. Why the villagers, I'll give you 20,000 rupees, brother. You tell the truth. That means you are the real Jaspal Patwari? Right. I'll go and tell each and every one. I'll shout on top of my voice to tell everyone. So Sweety consumed poison because of you. Poison? Sweety consumed poison? Oh my Sweety! Where is Sweety? Come with me, I'll take you to Sweety. I'll get on the scooter. Jaspal, my brother.. I know you are very stubborn. You will surely shout on top of your voice. Sit here? Get on to the other bike. Open it. Get locked. I'll keep it. Okay? Brother, Sweety is my first love. I cannot eat without her. I had to leave for some urgent work. Otherwise, I would never leave Sweety alone. Where are we going, brother? How much do you love our Sweety? This much. How much? This much. This is no good. Around two quintals' worth? Basmati or broken? Basmati. Sit down. Brother, can I have a drink? I'm almost as good as your brother-in-law now. Look at me. There is only one brother-in-law in this village and that is Jaila. Who does that to their brother-in-law? We cannot make anyone our brother-in-law. It is not anyone's fault. If you can a sister then you can have a brother-in-law. I told you we cannot address anyone as brother-in-law. - Fine, don't say it. - Okay. But this pencil thin can address me so. I won't address him as brother-in-law, but I can address the other one. He is right. He looks like our brother-in-law. What do we do about him then? What do we do? I have three ways in which I can kill him. I can either drown him. I can electrocute him. Or I can have him shredded. Tell me, how should we kill you? The way you are behaving.. I'll die of shame. Brother Jaila still hasn't manage to die of shame. What makes you think you'll die of shame? Monty! Mother, I'll shoot him. Patience. Each bullet costs 125 rupees. And he is only worth Rs. 27.75. Strangle him to death! Do it. Brother.. No.. Pull him, Monty. Take him away. - And make sure not to dirty your clothes. - No! Cheers! Much better. You know this canal passes through my mother's maternal village. Tell me something what relation do you have in Chanab? My father's sister's married there. Why? Your father's sister is my mother's sister's sister-in-law. Okay. Then let her be our matchmaker. Really, do we need a matchmaker? My family is preparing for the betrothal ceremony. Your family hasn't started preparing? We were waiting for my father to agree. He just agreed. Now we will start preparing. I'm thinking about not getting married to you. Oh I see. May I ask why? I love your handwriting in the letters that you send. You won't be writing me letters after we get married. I don't write them anyway, Sunny writes them. Oh no. I am joking. I write them. You'll find a new letter.. ..every morning under your pillow even after we get married. You can read them. Then it's okay. Would you like to eat an ice cream? Shall we share? So son-in-law, all set? Brushed your teeth? Let's get you married then. I won't marry her. You can do whatever you want. Why are you inviting death? It's better to die like a brave man than live like a coward. I'll shoot you. Can you shoot? Go ahead. - Monty! - Yes, brother? Do you remember the magician and the parrot's story? No, brother. Idiot. He's the magician and he's his parrot. Parrot? His life lies in the parrot. But brother he is a Patwari. I feel like killing you instead of them. Let's go, Mr. Parrot. He will come on his own. Come on. - Let's go. - Come Magician or your parrot is going to die. You did a great job, Jaila. I was thinking since this morning.. ..but couldn't recollect. Now I recollected it. Did you see the film Loha? Dharmendra was the hero in that film. So you are like the villain Amrish Puri, right? How sweet of you, son. Mr. Amrish Puri is my guru. But you will be released only after the wedding. - What? - Yes. Stop. Stop it. So Patwari, did you also hit a jackpot? Yes, like you hit the target. But where are you going to get married? In this village. Marriage hall. Marriage hall? Don't joke with me. I'll kill you right away. Why would I joke with you? You aren't my sister-in-law. I'll make you bend and hit on your butt. I'm going to the marriage Why are you fighting, to-be-grooms? There are two girls getting married in Tharkhardi marriage hall today. What? Thank you for informing us. Otherwise, all the guests would have been gravely injured. Then we will end up being relatives. Come on everybody, dance! Go for it! Dance! So son-in-law.. Why are you sulking? Look up there. There is a truck loaded with dowry standing outside. There is Sweety who is loaded with jewelry and beauty. And Jaila will be your brother-in-law. Sorry. You will be my brother-in-law. What else can you ask for? People will get out your way. They'll say there comes Jaila's brother-in-law. - There goes Jaila's brother-in-law. - Yes. - There comes Jaila's son-in-law. - Yes. - There goes Jaila's brother-in-law. - Yes. - Then again they will say.. - Shut up. He understood. Brother-in-law, guess who is behind me? Sister-in-law was standing behind you? I swear, she was completely hidden. I never realized. Sister-in-law, you are looking so beautiful today. Right, Jaspal? We believe you. A man who is dying never lies. Brother Jaila, we are missing the audience. Audience, why, are we having a tournament here? No, but we had invited everyone. No one has showed up. So what? We'll go to each and every house in the village and force feed them. Hey you drummer, play some music. Harman, I want to talk to you. What do you want to talk to her about? Is there anything left to be said? There is still a lot to say. But I need to tell you something important. Look son, we have already been embarrassed in front of the village because of you. Don't get us embarrassed anymore. Let our daughter get married without any problems. Uncle.. Tell me. Harman, I don't know why Sweety lied. But look into my eyes and tell me.. ..do you think your Jaspal can be wrong? It's okay if you don't want to marry me. But don't ruin your life by believing on hearsay. Do you hear the music? My groom's wedding procession is here. Heed my advice and get married to Sweety. You've lost your love anyway. At least try and save your friend. Jaila, take care of your son-in-law. Brother-in-law, visiting hours are over for you. Come back. - Let's go everyone. - Let's go. Are you coming here, Or should I kill your friend? How about a song anyone? "Stop this daily drama of yours." "Why do you building castles in the air?" "Stop this daily drama of yours." "Why do you building castles in the air?" "You are yet to get me the anklets you had promised." "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." "I will fulfil all your wishes." "I always carry a blank cheque with me." "I will fulfil all your wishes." "I always carry a blank cheque with me." "I can get credit wherever and whenever I want." "Others are given credit because of their name.." "I am given credit because of my credit card." "Others are given credit because of their name.." "I am given credit because of my credit card." Oh yes. Look at the way they are dancing. "I am better off staying away from you." "I had gifted you a ring but you sold it off." "I had gifted you a ring but you sold it off." "I am better off staying away from you." "I had gifted you a ring but you sold it off." "He knows about each and every brand.." "How about gifting me something for a change?" "He talks about things beyond his reach.." The best man has come on a rickshaw? Looks like a new tradition I guess. Let's go, guys. Welcome. - Hello. - Hello to everyone. Hello. Welcome. Girls, make him cut the ribbon. Fritters are getting cold inside. Not so easily. First, put 1100 rupees in the plate. I'll give you a tight slap. You want 1100 rupee from me? Give me the scissors. Brother-in-law will cut the ribbon. This is a limit. I am your brother-in-law. Who else is your brother-in-law? If you are her brother-in-law then am I here to sing wedding songs? I don't care whether you sing or dance. I am here to get married to Harman. Master, I'll beat you black and blue if you don't stop joking. Harman is going to get married to Patwari Bharpur Singh. Jogga, you aren't worthy. You come in a rickshaw and compete with a Patwari. I am not crazy to compete with you. Patwari has just cleared high school. I'm a graduate in arts and education. What you earn in a month, I earn it in a year. - Right. - Bloody schoolteacher. I can see your income. Here's your money earned through illicit means. And this is hard earned money. Teners is what one can afford. Listen, if you wanted him then why did you invite me? Who invited you? This idiot who is standing here. Why aren't you saying anything? Yes, my niece Harman told me to invite the groom. You idler! You useless worthless idiot! Don't take up the unnecessary responsibility of the village. Harman told me, her real uncle. Oh I see. I was mistaken. Don't worry, Master. I'll be careful next time. Will be careful next time! I'll slap you! What do I do now? You go to school. Why take a day off? The second class must be in session now. Should I turn the rickshaw around? Shut up. Don't make me slap you. He is more eager to leave than me. Look sir, I am making a request here. All my friends and relatives are with me. Just get Harman married to me for once. You can ask me to divorce her after a week if you want. Wait, how dare you, I'll teach you a lesson. I'll break your neck. This is what I can dare to do then! - Let's go, charioteer. - Okay. Take the rickshaw inside. Hail Lord Rama! Attack! "I will gift you gems and jewelry." "I will buy you new dresses." "I will gift you gems and jewelry." "I will buy you new dresses." "For your beautiful company, I can go to any extent." "Come what may, I won't back off." Boss, you have touched the grounds of the village. It's okay, now I don't care even if I lose my legs. But I will make sure that Patwari loses his head. "Others are given credit because of their name.." "I am given credit because of my credit card." "Let me tell you something.." "Why don't you try taking a loan?" "Let me tell you something.." "Why don't you try taking a loan?" "There is no harm in trying." "We can then get married immediately." Listen.. They won't let our Harman get married. You tell me what should I do then? Don't worry, brother. I'll go talk to them. "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." Now will Harman not be able to marry Bharpur Singh even when you are here? Malkit Singh, as you have addressed me as brother.. ..then it is my responsibility to get both of them married. "Don't own a car or a cart." "But my heart is bigger than your farmhouse." "You always keep taunting me." "Your issues are making me lose weigh." "I am a regular at bars and police station these days." "Others are given credit because of their name.." "I am given credit because of my credit card." "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." "Others are given credit because of their name.." "I am given credit because of my credit card." "You wish to buy the moon without a penny in your pocket, you buffoon." Wait, let me teach you a lesson! Harman is getting married to Patwari Bharpur Singh. Great. Master, do you have an objection? No, what objection can I have? Whatever you say. Well, as I've taken a day off and haven't even brought my lunch along.. ..can I eat lunch before I leave? Congratulations. Don't worry, don't feel disheartened, Master. You can be my best man. Make sure you eat lunch before you leave. And don't forget the dessert. Get me something to eat. Where else do I sit? There isn't enough space to keep a handbag there. Come on, it's time to take the wedding vows. Don't feel so trapped, brother-in-law. Stand up. Oh no.. My innocent brother-in-law, please get up. You are very nice. Don't do that. Let's go. My nice brother-in-law. Come on Harman, let's go and get you married. Come on. What's wrong, Sweety? Sweety got married? That too with someone else? Sweety! You are going to get married to someone else? You forgot your Jaspal? What is this nonsense? Jaspal? If he is Jaspal then who is he? We've reached the climax. We will have fun now. - Good, at least my day didn't go waste. - Right. Do one thing, get a hot piece of bread and some creamy cottage cheese. Okay. How did he come here? Stop your nonsense! Throw him out. You forgot all the promises you had made to me? Stop your nonsense, you dog! Why should I stop? I'll tell the whole village! Listen to me, brother. Hello, hello. Aunt, at least you listen to me. Get lost. - I am in love with Sweety. - Stop! Excuse me, brother.. You won't be able to catch him for another day or two. Hello? Your target went that way. Damn you. How can you just kill me? I will tell everyone. Come on, we won't spare you today. Listen up villagers, I am the real Jaspal Patwari. Sweety.. used to love me. And she had consumed poison because of me. Listen up, boy. Point the gun on his brain. Stupid, those are his knees. Here's where brain is located. - Don't shoot my brains out. - No! - Brain.. - No! Stop this storm. No brother, don't kill him. My sister got her voice back. See how powerful true love is. Tone down the power, I cannot breathe. I'll die. Sweety, you cannot marry this monkey. You will get married to this boy. Enough. I'll get married to Jaspal. Look Jaila, you goon, she too has agreed to marry me. I am not talking about you. I am talking about that Jaspal. Stop your nonsense, girl. Talk to her, uncle. What is she talking about? You keep quiet, girl. If he can't be my sister's husband.. ..then he cannot be anyone's husband. - Sweety! - Oh no! You can snatch as well? Point your guns to the sky! Do it! Empty them. Come on. Harman? Talk to her. Now she is standing with me. Tables have turned now. Jaspal my brother, don't get so hyper or your friend will die. Release Sunny. Otherwise, I know where does your uncle Jaila's brain lies. You are our uncle? You never told us. Idiots, I am your brother and not your uncle. Officer.. Why are you giving the wrong impression to these idiots? Now they will always address me as uncle. - Release him. - Okay. Listen up! All the Monty, Nonty, Sweety and Tweety.. Harman will be getting married to me. Anyone who has the courage can stop me. There was just one bullet in it. There was just one bullet in it. There was just one bullet in it. Well done, you fools. Who are you addressing as a fool? You trusted me? I can lie as well! Oh no, wait a minute Damn you. Brother Jaila, why are you getting beaten up? Don't worry, I have a gun. Will you join us after I die? I have a gun. Take this. Come here. Let me go. Damn you. Come on. Brother Jaila, don't waste time talking now. Just shoot him. Stop, Jaila. Kashmiro, you? I am seeing you after such a long time. I keep visiting. I come here to the doctor to get medicines for him. You still haven't mended your ways? You spent your whole life in prison. Kashmiro, for whom should I mend my ways? Your father got you married to him. You are unwell? For how much longer do you plan to live? Let's see. - I'm here to talk to you. - Tell me. I don't want her to have the same fate as me. She should marry the boy she loves. You will listen to me, won't you? Kashmiro.. I've always agreed to everything that you've said. Here, I've dropped my gun. Are you happy now? I am warning you, I don't know how to use it, so back off. I won't let her marry anyone else. She will get married to me. Patwari, you might end up dying instead. Let's go or are you waiting for her to make you her brother? Master, considering the circumstances.. ..I don't think there are any bullets left in this. Otherwise, I'd shoot you with it. Why are you wasting a bullet on me? I am anyway dying of humiliation. I am just acting stubborn and enjoying the lunch. Come and have some. Bread's quite tasty. I'll shoot you. - At least release its lock. - Where is it? Let me tell you. Give it to me. It's lock will be opened by its owner. Here, it belongs to you. Let's go. - What are you doing, Master? - Two to-be-grooms are leaving this place. So technically, we are relatives. Come with me. - Harman! - We'll go out in the evening. Tell me about it. Even the respect given to a fake person is a fake. Real respect is given to a honest person. The one you can shake hands with and hug them. God bless you. Congratulations. God bless you, children. I had purchased this bottle to celebrate my wedding. I didn't know that I'd have to drink it after being humiliated. Don't worry. We will bill this bottle to the officer.. ..who stole the beautiful schoolteacher out of our hands. This is what they call.. Fate decides.. And you have to abide. Listen.. - Patwari.. - Yes Master. Shouldn't we go with an excuse of giving them a gift. Have a look? No way, man. My heart aches. I won't be able to give any gift. I will only be able to cause trouble. No.. That damned officer.. He has such big moustaches. Someone ask him, why does he have such big moustaches? Does he want to carry pail on them? - Can I say something? - Yes? He is a very bad officer. - Really? - Yes. He is very rude. Our Harman won't be able to spend more than six months with him. - I see. - Yes. - Really? - Yes. They will get divorced for sure. That's great. - Now what we need to know is that.. - What? After our Harman gets divorced.. Loved by everyone. Does she marry a Master or a Patwari! "You dress to kill."
