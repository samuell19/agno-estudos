[ Man On Radio, Indistinct ] [ Woman On Radio ] An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan... was delivered dead on arrival today... [ Man On Radio ] The Centers for Disease Control. [ Man #2 On Radio ] Are we dealing with an epidemic? [ Man #1 On Radio ] Whatever the carrier, we know that it's not the water. We don't believe that it's airborne. [ Children ] One, two, three, four... [ Siren Wailing ] [ Girl Gasping, Sobbing ] [ Man ] Strickler's Disease was first diagnosed two years ago. We're no better off now. [ Child Coughing ] [ Man Continues ] I needed you to see this foryourself, Dr. Tyler. It's the same at every hospital in the city. For the lucky ones, it's a lifetime in leg braces. - [ Labored Breathing ] - [ Crying ] Most of these kids won't make it. [ Child Coughing ] [ Labored Breathing ] We need your help. [ Hydraulics Hissing ] [ Wind Howling ] [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Clicking ] [ Hissing ] [ Chirping ] [ Flapping ] [ Man ] Strickler's Disease came to New York... like a thief in the night, threatening to steal... an entire generation ofour children from before our eyes. [ Man On TV ] Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control... [ Man ] The killer was cunning. It was deadly. Neither a cure nor a vaccine could be found. We at the CDC had to contain it... before it could spread beyond Manhattan Island. So we went after its carrier, the common cockroach. Or rather she did. Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason that there hasn't been... a new case ofStrickler's in this city for six months. - Dr. Susan Tyler. - [ Audience Applauding ] [ Woman Reporter] Dr. Susan Tyler, Professor of Entomology... at the New York State Univeesity. - [ Reporter Continues, Indistinct ] - Thank you, Peter. I don't think I need to tell you New Yorkersjust how resilient... - the common cockroach is. - [ Audience Laughing ] Since it has proven to be virtually immune to chemical control, we had to find a new avenue of attack. So, with the aid of genetics labs across the country, we recombined termite and mantid DNA to create a biological counteragent, a new species to be our six-legged ally... in wiping out the roach population. We call it the "Judas" breed. Once in contact with theJudas' secretions, the common roaches were infected with an enzyme... - which caused their metabolism to go into overdrive. - Come on, Susan! - [ Peter ] You're missing it. - No matter how much the common roaches ate, every last member of the nest... starved to death within a matter of houes. - [ Audience On TV Applauding ] - I hope someone's taping this. [ Man On TV ] This announcement's been a long time coming, - ladies and gentlemen. - Coming home. The Strickler's outbreak has officially been contained. - The epidemic is over. - [ Audience Applauding ] Hey, Susan. Honey. - Any other questions? - Dr. Mann, what did this victory mean to you personally? [ Peter On TV ] It means that I can move on to other projects with the, uh... - Our 15 minutes are gone. - [ Peter Continues Indistinct ] And personally, um, it's where I met my wife. What is this? Is this some kind of Catholic guilt thing? We don't even know what the impact is of what we did. - The impact is that... - [ Splashing ] a lot of kids will be running around next year because of you. A lot of kids. - Hey! - Maybe we get lucky. [ Sighs ] Maybe a couple ofthem'll be oues someday. - Oh, a couple, huh? - Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. We're not rushing things. [ Peter] I didn't want to overtaxyou. It's been a hard year. [ Susan Laughing ] It's been a great year. [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Rain Falling ] [ Thunderclap ] - [ Pounding ] - [ Speaking In Foreign Dialect ] [ Pounding Continues ] [ Panting ] [ Speaking In Foreign Dialect ] [ Panicked Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Child Humming ] [ Humming ] Oxfords.

[ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Rustling, Clicking Noises ] [ Rustling, Clicking Noises Continue ] [ Bones Cracking ] [ Rustling, Clicking Noises Stop ] [ Spoons Drop ] Funny, funny shoes. Funny... Can you raise it a little bit on the left? It's sort of drooping. Don't you think? Husband, incoming, 6:00. I'm sorry I was late. Everything crazy out there today? I got T.B. breaking out all over the city... and the mayor's in my face about scaring off another convention. [ Beeping ] It's Bruce. I'll call him later. So- [ Chuckles ] Nice lunch, huh? Very nice lunch. Choose. - What's this? - Come on, choose. [ Chuckles ] Oh, honey, why'd you get this? Baby in a bottle. It's ours. Dr. Chadwick said if you take that twice a we... Do you know where this comes from? Sure. It comes from the urine of Italian menopausal nuns. So? Monks bottle their own wine, so... Not natural, Peter. Um, would you at least think about this? For the last six months, I've been the one running around with ice in my underwear. And that's not natural. [ Beeping ] I really got to go. See you. [ Indistinct Chattering ] [ Man ] Hold it right there, sir. CDC. Hey, Boss, welcome to disease land. Tuck it in. All right. All right. [ Siren Wailing ] We sure this is yellow fever? What, are you ignoring your pages now? Listen, I... Okay, these two cops saw the broken scaffold, and then the paint mess here. And then they looked through that cellar window. Go ahead. Take a look. - [ Gasps ] - [ Indistinct Chatter ] Pleasant, isn't it? Couldn't let 'em out until you gave me the okay, so... This piece of shit chapel here is a front for the Triads. Chinese mob. The snake had people in from UNAD. Slave labor. How long have they been operating? I don't know. Five, six years. Too long. Oh, have you had lunch? Uh-huh. Try to keep it down when you see this, okay? [ Knocks ] Roughly three dozen people were trapped in here. One toilet, no paper. We got bacterial samples reading off the scale, though nothing's airborne. Uh, we got a Reverend Harry Ping. Preacher? Yeah. Preacher, if you can imagine that. He ran this place. But there's no sign of him. So what do you say, boss? Quarantine 'em. Quarantine the cops that found it. Quarantine anybody who touched anything. Immigration's gonna love you. Tell 'em to send the flowers to the usual address. You got it. [ Person Coughing ] Piece of shit on the ceiling. Hmm? Figure that one out. Here you go, Josh. [ Train Passing Beneath ] The subway? You know what? I-I- This is what I love about my job. I get to travel, see the world... and meet new exotic cultures. It's- It's all bacterial, but hey, what the fuck, right? [ Woman Speaking Chinese ] You're gonna be okay. We'll take care of you. Hey, she doesn't speak English. Uh, you tell her, please. [ Speaks Chinese ] [ Woman Continues ] Man, she's delirious. [ Woman Continues ] What's she saying? I don't know. She, uh, keeps saying something like the dark angels. She says they're coming to get her. Chinese people, man. They come up with some pretty wild stuff. Thanks a lot, Miguel. Board up every exit. If this leads to the subways, I don't want anything to spread. Quarantine everybody. [ Elevator Whirs ] But, um, in the middle of the third date, he tells me that he wears women's underwear. [ Chuckles ] What a pervert. This city is full of perverts. [ Chuckles ] Some of your fans. - You're the bug lady, right? - That's me. We're here to deal. [ Electrical Buzzing ] When you pick them up, you should pick 'em up by this front vein on the wing, 'cause it's the strongest part of the wing. See, that way you don't break it. Now, let's see what else you have in here. Oh, look. - What do we have here? - Swallowtail? - Excellent. - How come you like bugs so much? Just imagine that you're one of them. What, eating furniture and stuff? That's gotta suck. No, no, no. Now, don'tjudge them too quickly. These guys were building castles while dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards. Now, sayyou're him. He's what we call a soldier. Now, there is no way that you would ever quit fighting, no matter how badly injured you were. It would be a battle to the death. [ Insects Chirping ] But most insects don't kill... unless their territory is invaded. You'd just stun your prey up here. And then you drag it all the way down through here to there, into what is kind of like a pantry. [ Insects Chirping ] We eat it alive? Yeah. You're not really squeamish about those kind of things. This is the nest. It's the heart of the colony. The big enchilada. Why? Well, if anything were to happen to the nest, the entire colony would die out. I'd just bail and start my own. Well, you couldn't do that. See... that big guy there? Next to the queen? Wait. Look over there. He's the king. And out of all the nest, he's the only fertile male. He got a good deal. [ Laughs ] Yeah. It's a simple structure designed for their survival. It's perfectly balanced, and it's very beautiful. Whatever peels your banana, lady. So, you wanna buy the butterflies, orwhat? [ Chirping ] [ Susan ] You know what? You guys have done a really good job. So, how about five bucks? [ Boy ] That's your best? - I'm gonna show her the weird bug. - Costs a dollarjust to look. [ Boy With Cap ] It's a really great bug. Got it on the subway. - We kind of broke it a little. - Okay. My best offer. Ten bucks for everything, plus a specimen jar, some tweezers and some mounts. Deal. Are you crazy? This is the best. This is our meal ticket. Come on. Bug's almost dead anyway. [ Blows ] It's yours. [ Woman ] You gave 'em ten bucks. They're from Alphabet City. There's much worse things they could be selling. Oh, no. Your papers. Help me get the window. Susan. Push. [ Wind Howling ] Oh, come on. Oh, I hate this window. [ Woman ] Okay, on three. One, two, three. [ Chirping, Clicking ] [ Man On Police Radio ] Who the hell do you thinkyou are, putting my two officers on quarantine? [ Peter] Listen to me, Captain. Those two, they go home, they kiss their wives, they kiss their kids, and I'm the one with a full-blown epidemic... [ Chattering ] Come on, Chuy. We have to make dinner. Dinner. [ Man On Radio ] I don't care. [ Peter] Well, I do care! Jesus, God, I hate cops. They make the worst coffee. [ Siren Wailing ] Shiny wire. Don't stare. People look back if you stare. I've had limited success with this combination of pheromones... because it tends to wear off. But now, watch this male when I add sound. [ Recording of Bugs Chirping ] [ Woman Laughs ] See, this is a female I recorded in the field. Look at him go. It's like the Donna Summer ofcricketdom. Wow. He wants it bad. [ Chuckles ] Siren song. If we put these speakers in fields that are overinfested, we can collect the males, save the crops... and restore the balance of the ecosystem. All without putting harmful chemicals in food. [ Clicking, Tapping ] What the hell? [ Clicking ] [ Clicking, Hissing ] [ Squeaks ] Shit! Those kids, we've gotta find them. [ Insect Buzzing ] [ Siren Wailing ] - I can't believe this. - What? I spend an hour in the field. I get a weekend's worth of crap. [Josh ] Oh, speaking of that. That turd that I took to the lab? I found these in it. [ Clears Throat ] What are they? - Buttons. - Buttons? Maybe they needed fiber. [ Laughs ] [ Insect Chirping ] Wow. Oh, my God. You'rejust a baby. [ Chirping ] [ Grunts ] [ Flapping ] [ Sighs ] [ Squeals ] [ Rustling Noise ] Oh, my God.

They are breeding. - I shine them good. - [ Indistinct Chattering ] Chuy, Black Lincoln. Chuy? Black Lincoln. This one. Chuy, pay attention, please. This is where you found the bug? Yeah, man. But they changed the lock. You sure you haven't seen one of those? No. What is it? It's an ootheca. It's kind of a fancy name for an egg case. There's probably more, like, weird bugs inside of it. No way. I see one of those, I puke. Here you go. - Here. - Hold on. Is there money to be made on this egg thing? Sorry. Dealing days are over. Vámonos. These egg things look nasty.

Dear Susan, is it answers you want from me, or is it absolution? You still think making theJudases was wrong? Three years ago, I would've called it unforgivable. But I have two grandchildren who are alive today probably because of you. It would be a tad hypocritical for me to passjudgement. That's not an answer, Walter. [ Whispering ] It's not an easy question. But as to theJudases, I think it's likely some survived. Evolution has a way of keeping things alive. But they all died in the lab. Yes, Susan.

Very soon, lady! [ Panting ] [ Stick Clanking ] - There it is. - Drag it out. - There it is! - Drag it out! [ Cans Clanking ] You better tell me... what the hell's goin' on around here. Aah! [ Rapid Gunfire ] [ Leonard ] Aah! [ Grunting ] [ Leonard ] Oh, man. [ Leonard Groaning ] Okay, Leonard. Okay. [ Groaning ] It's gonna be fine. You'll be fine. [ Groaning ] Okay. You just stay calm. Okay, there we go. Everything's gonna be okay. [ Sobbing ] Ah, Christ. [ Leonard Groaning ] [ Peter ] Josh will be here soon. He'll bring us some help. You're dreamin', man. If your boy was comin' back, he'd have been here by now. They got his ass, man. They ate his ass, man. We don't know that. And if you think there's not another one of those things out there, what has been puttin' that shit all over the walls? Listen, Leonard. If you keep on screaming like that, we're gonna meet the rest of its family. Manny? Manny, be careful. It-It's dead. No, no, no. I emptied two clips into that thing and it kept comin'. [ Susan ] Wait, wait a second. Help me turn it over. Peter, these are lungs. What the hell is she talkin' about? Biology 101 . You know, insects don't have lungs. That's what limits their size. The secretions are the same. [ Panting ] Oh, God. [ Susan ] When I increased theJudas's metabolism, I must have sped up its breeding cycle. I mean, we're talking tens, hundreds of thousands of generations. I mean, who knows how many mutations. Listen, I... I just don't fuckin' get this. How could the... How could theJudas evolve into this? [ Susan ] Think generations, not years, okay? It took only 40,000 generations for apes to turn into humans. So? We changed its DNA, Peter. I mean, we don't know what we did! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Hold on! If that thing has been around, how come- How come nobody's ever seen it? I think we have. [ Flare Whooshes ] Sometimes an insect will evolve to mimic its predator. A fly can look like a spider. A caterpillar can look like a snake. TheJudas evolved to mimic its predator. Us. [ Peter] Nobody up there knows about this? [ Susan ] Nobody would. Not until it's too late. These things can imitate us. They can infiltrate us and breed a legion before anyone would even notice. How- How could you do this? You-You take something and you-you make it like a man. A man who's not a man, he's a- Manny! He's a thing! Manny! That steals my child! Manny, you tell her, 'cause she don't give a goddamn. Hey, hey, hey. - Your kid's gone. - Hey, shut up. - My leg's chewed to the bone! - Shut up, will ya? Shut the fuck up! - And they're both talkin' about insects with lungs! - Shut up! [ Crashing Noise ] [ Flapping Noise ] Oh, shit! They're everywhere! - [ Clanking Noise ] - [ Groans ] [ Peter] Manny, get over here! [ Screeching ] Aah! It's the blood! [ Susan ] The smell of the blood is driving them crazy! Oh, shit! [ Banging ] [ Susan ] We have to cover the scent! Manny, give me your razor. Give me your razor! [ Banging, Glass Shattering ] [ Glass Shattering ] [ Sloshing Noise ] Here. Take it. Rub it on the windows. Anywhere where there's a crack. Wha... - Just do it! - Come on! [ Banging ] Oh! What the- Ah! What is it? Scent glands. Insects use them to identify themselves. Here. Rub it all overyourself. They won't attackyou if they thinkyou're one of them. Me! [ Banging, Crashing ] [ Groans ] [ Noises Stop ] [ Panting ] [ Groans ] Phew! It worked. [ Whispering ] Do you mind if... Go ahead. [ Leonard Whispering ] Manny, give me your lighter. Look. This is where we are. Now, these tunnels may lead to the surface. Yes. If we can get... this car moving, we might be able to make it. [ Loudly ] What... [ Whispering ] What do you mean, might? I mean, probably. But even if they do, th-this thing's been down here rotting for halfa century. How do you know it'll move? Listen to me. Listen. This car is a CR-17 from Coney Island. Believe me, it was made to last. Now, Manny, there's a track relay switch in this room here. You switch the tracks. That'll get us going. Yes, I'll try. - [ Manny ] I'll try. - Do. There's a fuse box down the tracks. If I can rewire it, I can juice up the whole system. Leonard, man. Look at yourself, I- I'll do it. - Hey, if you talk me through it, I'll go out there. - All you've gotta do is... No, no, no, no. I'll go. I'll go. Why? I know much more about what's out there than you do. [ Peter Sighing ] You're right. You understand the creature, and, uh, Leonard knows the subway, so... so this is the way it's gotta be. Whatever happens, it's Manny and me. Why? [ Peter] You two have gotta stay on this car. You gotta get back up. You gotta undo this. So, I'll go. We'll go. Yes. I have to put this on you now. They mimic us. We mimic them. Ah, Peter, Peter. Peter, look. You'll find two wires... one green, the other blue. Okay. Man, this-this shit can't be sanitary. Take it off. No, man. Leave it on. Leave it on. [ Banging, Creaking ] [ Creaking Continues ] Don't touch it. Try not to sweat. They sense chemical changes. Oh, okay. Okay, I'll-I'll try not to sweat. [ Clicking Noise ] Chuy! Susan, he's in. He just needs to find the switch. Good. Green. Blue. Green, blue. Green, blue. [ Clicks Lighter Shut ] Shit. [ Panting ] [ Breathing Noise ] [ Grating Closes ] [ Gasping ] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. [ Panting ] [ Creaking Noise ] [ Footsteps ] [ Clacking Noise ] [ Groaning ] Chuy! Chuy! [ Groaning ] Chuy, it's me. Come on, Manny. What's takin' you so long? Do these subway tracks lead to the regular train tunnels... at Grand Central and Penn Station? Yeah, yeah. Well, they'll use them to migrate out of the city. After that, they'll set up colonies anywhere they can. [ Electricity Crackles ] [ Peter] Fuck. - [ Panting ] - [ Crackles ] [ Susan ] Now, every specimen we've seen has been female... because a male would be a lighter color and it would have no wings. And if they are holding true to theJudas's spawning pattern, the nest will have only one fertile male. Now, if we could catch that male and kill him, then the females won't be able to breed... and the whole generation could die out. Where the hell is the male? Chuy. Chuy. Chuy, come here. - [ Clicking ] - Come here. Come here. [ Chuckles ] Friends. Come here, please. - [ Guttural Growl ] - Aah! [ Groaning ] [ Panting ] [ Bones Breaking, Manny Screaming ] Oh, goddamn it! He must be in trouble! He must be in trouble! Shh, shh. Wait. Listen. [ Chuy Whimpering ] Oh, Jesus! I'm goin' out there. [ Panting ] You stay here. Listen. If the car starts, I'll meet you at the end of the platform. Chuy? [ Crackling ] Oh, my God. Oh, Manny. [ Footsteps ] Chuy. [ Train Passing Overhead ] [ Train Horn Honks ] Yes! Yes! CR-17 from Coney Island! Goddamn it! [ Wheels Whine On Tracks ] Aah! Oh, shit! Goddamn it! Goddamn! Shit! [ Groaning ] [ Pounding ] Leonard! [ Pounding ] Get away! Go away! I'm bleeding! Found a way out, on a dumbwaiter. Go away! Peter, I'm bleeding. Go away! I can't stop it. I can't stop it. They'll be here soon. Where's my wife? Go away. Where's Susan? Where's Susan? She went to get Manny. [ Screeching Noise ] [ Spoons Clacking ] Susan. Shh. They haven't seen us yet. Don't move. [ Scurrying Noise ] Peter, go!
