What should be a very tall order for the Harvard basketball team, the perennial power in Holy Cross and a team that is heavily favored in tonight's contest against the Crimson. But the Crimson whip a couple of key weapons to bring to bear. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): begins with Marcus playing. If going to have any chance of knocking off Holy Cross, Blake has got to have a huge game. And he can deliver the goods, believe me. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): --from outside, go to the hoop. Team's leading scorer and rebounder, Holy Cross has got to know where he is on the floor at all times. --superstar with Alan Jensen, the point guard. point guard. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): He distributes the ball well, gets all of his teammates involved in the action. But just one thing-- I don't see him out there in the warm up line. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): Where is Alan Jensen? Shit! What? The alarm didn't go off. Yeah, it did. You had the music blaring. No, it's supposed to buzz for at least a half an hour. You didn't turn it off yourself, did you? What's more important, basketball game or the greatest fuck in the world? Who are you referring to as the greatest fuck in the world? Oh, I was referring to you. But now that you mention it. Fuck! (SINGING) I can't get you-- I can't-- ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): --directly trying to a lot and he jams it in with both hands. Oh, wow, Alan Jensen, that's what he brings to the court. Defense. Defense. Defense. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): In the open court with a steal-- Defense. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): Oh Alan Jensen, he could do it in the defensive end. Look at the show boat. Look at the smile. You got to love that. Harvard now making a surge here, as their point guard has returned. Always has a Holy Cross, still the team on top of the sport. We're in a couple of and while Jensen to rally in the offensive end. Inside the play, tries to lay it in. Can't the ball. It looks like he did not like how that pass was thrown. But you got to get the ball you see those two guys on the same page, but a little bit too low for Jensen. not happy. Despite the surge from the crimson, it appears there will not be enough There will be another jumper for the key Well, this is going to be a big upset MARCUS BLAKE: Boy, do we suck. ALAN JENSEN: Holy Cross is good. MARCUS BLAKE: Holy Cross is OK. We suck. ALAN JENSEN: At least we won't lose to Dartmouth. We'll kill Dartmouth. MARCUS BLAKE: If you or I play bad, we lose to Dartmouth. ALAN JENSEN: If we lose to Dartmouth, we should quit the team and play tennis. MARCUS BLAKE: Tennis Harvard is good at. We wouldn't even make that team. Well, then, hockey. I don't skate. Swimming? I don't swim. No niggas, don't skate, don't swim. Yeah, well, I guess you can't have everything. I can't. You can. Yo, who was that cheerleader you slipped in with? You don't miss a trick, do you? Or even a pass, unless it's below my waist. You're to cool to bend now, huh? I got to stick to my personals, you know what I'm saying? Who was she? Cindy Bandolini. No relation to Andrew Bandolini, I hope. Yeah, well, that's her father. Why? Why? He runs the whole fucking mafia in the Northeastern United States, that's why. - No, no. That's total bullshit. He's into real estate and construction. Just because his name ends in a vowel, doesn't mean he's a gangster. - Yeah, right. Who told you that, Cindy? Well, she should know. Sure, she should. I'm sure she wouldn't brag about her father dumping bodies into the Charles River. This is a ploy, man. You're just trying to scare me off so you can get your hands on her. Man, you are crazy. There's 10 reasons why I could tell you, you shouldn't mess with her, and all 10 of them are bad. Great game. Yeah, another 30 points we would have been right there in the thick of things. Ah, well you were good. And you were great. Cindy. Marcus, my pleasure. You should be playing for Holy Cross. You'd have a shot at the NBA instead of playing in a league no one except gamblers cares about. - Come again? - Ivy League-- I mean, seriously, who cares who wins an Ivy League game, unless you've got like a huge bet on it? I wouldn't know about that shit. Look, I got swim team practice. Swim practice. i didn't know black people could swim. You shouldn't believe in stereotypes. CINDY: Who believes in stereotypes? I don't believe in stereotypes. ALAN JENSEN: Especially Italian-- like all Italians are gangsters. It's jealousy. Everybody wants to be Italian. Oh, can I get a Carlsberg in a bottle. - Sure. - Diet coke. OK. And I'm not just saying that because I'm Italian, because I'm not just Italian. My mother was half Jewish, half black, and a quarter Asian, as you know. That's 125%, besides I don't know. You must have me confused with someone else. What else don't I know about you? More than you can imagine. REPORTER (ON TV): peaceful and American town, population-- 5,000. Hey, turn that up. REPORTER (ON TV): it has struck in the form of a tornado. One minute, houses and farms, which had seemed for generations as strong as the plain, hardworking folks who lived in them, were standing, and the next, erased, as if they had-- My parents REPORTER (ON TV): are mounting. As for kept bodies among the debris. As of now, tragically, I can report 11 dead and at least 50 injured, many severely. All the lines are down. You'll just have to wait and pray. No, I'm going to have to do a lot more than that. CAPTAIN (OVER SPEAKER): This is your captain again. We're anticipating, uh-- food and this afternoon to Kansas City. The tornado problems that they've had have settled down now. It shouldn't affect us on our flight pattern. We have, uh-- three lovely flight attendants on board today-- Sheri, and Joanne, and Mark-- to serve you. So what you're saying is no insurance, no protection. And if you watch every dime, you'll have enough money to get you through the next three months? - Don't worry about it. - We'll be fine. It could have been a lot worse. Yeah, a nuclear bomb could've dropped on your head. But what about a loan? Didn't I just say don't worry about it? Look, you know what? You should go back to where you belong-- school-- that's your job. I didn't even know if you were alive. Well, if we were dead, we'd have called you. Can you get a loan or not? Listen, Ally, you may be-- It's not Ally, it's Alan. a big basketball star, but you are not too old for me to spank. You ask me a question once, not twice. Oh, come on, Steve. He's just trying to-- I feel as if I should be helping out. Fine. You want to help out? You get back where you belong. You got the Dartmouth game coming up. You know, I can't believe with the roots you have here, you can't get a fucking loan. Don't use that language in front of your mother. To rebuild a fucking house. Hey, I said, cut it out. So where do they expect you to live? In the toilet stall of an elementary school boy's room? Who's they? The government? The banks? Nobody owes us a thing. I owe you something. Well, fine. When you get to be a big, rich guy, you come on back and help us out. In the meantime, take a look around. We're not the only people in trouble here. Nobody has a place to live. Alan, we appreciate your coming back and trying to help out, but there's nothing for you to do now. The best thing for you to do is go back. We'll be fine. CHESNEY: So what are both Heidegger and Kierkegaard saying about the concept of dread versus simple fear? Fear is a manageable emotion, no matter how intense or extreme because fear is always fear of something, something physically real-- failure, disease, poverty, loss. And the instant the cause of that fear is eliminated, the fear itself vanishes as well. Dread, by contrast, is the feeling of terror without any concrete cause. Dread is the fear of nothing. So no change in the circumstances of one's life can weaken the power of that inexplicable and consuming void. Now, what state of consciousness are we describing here, if not madness, or to use the clinical term, psychosis? Why do you need that? It brings me closer. CHESNEY: Closer to what? It. Oh, and what's it? I'll know when I get there. These are all previews. CHESNEY: These what? Breakouts-- marijuana, orgasm. Fear being neurotic, dread being psychotic. Fear resting within the realm of the rationally comprehensible. Dread ranging beyond into the intellectually unreachable. So, to you, sex and drugs are the same thing. Well, they have the same goal-- transcendence. Are you sure you're not just talking about feeling good? Mm. Absolutely. It's way beyond that. See, I'm trying to get the thing inside-- the thing behind the I, behind the hi, I'm Alan, front that we put out to the world. It's like I'm in a straight jacket that I'm trying to unsnap. You're not following me, are you? Of course I'm following you. What do you think I was talking about in class today? Has it ever occurred to you that, maybe, what's behind the hi, I'm Alan, is nothing-- the void. That's what I'm trying to find out. Impotent in the face of this annihilating dread, we turn to chemicals, particularly the so-called antipsychotics of which Prozac is the most familiar at present. What other drugs have you done besides marijuana? Not much. A little this, a little of that, just to see. Have you ever done LSD? No. All right. well, don't. It could fuck you up for life. You think so. Yeah, I know so. Everyone says it's coming back. Everybody's telling me it's benign. Benign? But what won't work against dread, what is laughable in response to that nothingness, that gaping inner void is words-- words. I have a friend, Sandy King, she's a-- she's a chem major. She's working on it. She's making it? Synthesizing it from the original formula, the true Swiss blue. First off, she's not your friend. Second, think of it as cyanide. It is words in their suddenly cacophonous, meaninglessness, words in the very multiplicity of the voices that haunt one's mind, voices that won't shut up, which uniquely characterize all forms of madness. You know there's people who did acid in the '60s who are still out there today. The lucky ones are in the mountains of Nepal staring out into space. And the unlucky ones are screaming in agony whenever they're not tranquilized. You're talking about addicts. No, I'm talking about people like you and me. The fact that these words have no meaning, that they are nothing but sounds haunting us, makes the condition of dread all the more impossible to bear, which leads us to Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher we shall be reading next, whose major contribution was precisely to level a devastating assault on the validity of language itself. Are you in love with me? That's a question you wouldn't ask if you weren't getting stoned. No transition, coming out of nowhere. What's the answer? I don't have an answer. ALAN JENSEN: Have you been fucking other people? What do you want the answer to be, yes or no? I want the answer to be the truth. No, you don't. Now where were you? ALAN JENSEN: With you. CHESNEY: Only at the end. Were you thinking about another girl? ALAN JENSEN: I was thinking about my parents. CHESNEY: Oh, that's pretty perverse. ALAN JENSEN: No, not sexually. Their house was blown away in a tornado. No insurance? Not against tornadoes. How much do they need? About $100,000. How are they going to get it? From me. Oh, you have that kind of money? Not yet. How are you going to get it? I don't know yet. Do you have any rich Harvard friends? There must be enough Sanza CEOs to rebuild the whole town of Maryville. No, not buddies of mine. What about girls? What about them? Are you seeing any that have money? I'm seeing one other girl besides you, but-- Who? Cindy. Cindy, who? Cindy Bandolini. She's a cheerleader at Holy Cross. She's not related to that gangster, is she? What gangster? The one there's always talking about on the news-- Andrew Bandolini. Yeah, that's her father, but he's not a gangster. He's into real estate and construction. And I'm a civil engineer. - It bothers you, doesn't it? - What? That I'm seeing someone else? Oh, god, you're off by light years. Oh, yeah? How so? Why don't you ask him for the money? Who? Andrew? Never even met the guy. Cindy has. Ask her. Alan? I need to talk to you. What? No fucking way would my father give you $100,000. He wouldn't give me $100,000. He doesn't give. He takes. I'm not asking for a gift. I'm asking for a loan. I'd pay back with interest and I'd pay it back on time. On what time, when? - Six months. - Six months? What's going to change in six months? You can't get your hands on $100,000 now. How are you going to do it then? I need it, Cindy. Yeah, well, that's another song. A lot of people need $100,000. It doesn't mean they can get their hands on it. I'll ask him, but I know what he's going to say. He's going to tell me I'm not living in the real world. (SINGING) Fucked up with a girl. Star-crossed fate was cruel-- So how did you get this car if your father gives you nothing? - I won it at a raffle. - A raffle? At my father's country club. Oh, pretty lucky. No luck, all skill. (SINGING) The way you phrase just like a child. Your arms embrace, your lips I taste. The way you want me everyday. Wow. This is where you grew up? Monte x, minus $59 and $55. And the hooch-- minus $9,000. The Russian-- plus $6,000. Danny Hollywood-- minus $39,340. Vegas burner-- plus $17,650. The doctor-- minus $6,266. What's the total handle? The total is we win $365, 254. Good week. Not bad. By the way, I told Jason from we-- Anything you need, you let me know. What about the local chump? Daddy loves this music. Flick your wrist Some day, I'm going to teach this guy how to throw a pass. Let's just say, he doesn't have it. You want me to scare him? - Do whatever you got to do. - Hi, Russel. Hi, Cindy. How are you? Very well, thank you. Hi, daddy Hello, sweetheart. Daddy, this Alan Jensen. He's a good friend of mine. Oh, yeah? How good? Daddy, he's just trying to see if he can intimidate you. He can, easily. See how cool he is? Oh, yeah, he's real cool. He's got a face like a choirboy. Don't he look like a choirboy? Oh, yeah, definitely. No, he looks like one of those, uh-- - An angel. - No, it's not an angel. You see it up in the churches. What's it called? - A crucifix. - No, it's not a crucifix. - Serif. - Serif, there you go What's a Sheriff got to do what a Church? Not a Sheriff, a serif, you moron. So what do you do with yourself, uh-- Alan. Chubby? Hey, chubby, shut the fuck up and listen. So what do you with yourself, Alan? - I'm a student. - That's nice. Where at? - Harvard. Harvard? What do you study at Harvard? Philosophy. Is that so? That's very interesting. Well, thanks for trying. What do you mean trying? He said he couldn't help out. He said that because he didn't want the guys to hear-- doesn't want them thinking they can ask him for favors. Are you telling me he's lending me $100,000? Not lending-- giving. Are you serious? Thank you. You're welcome. You won't regret this. I sure hope not. What do you mean when you say you study philosophy? Oh, you study the work of people throughout history who've had important or original things to say about the purpose of life, sanity, morality, love, language, and you respond to them. Did you know any of this, Russell? - No. - How about you? Uh-- part of it, but not all of it. What part? The first part. What part did you know, Russell? I don't know any part. I'm still thinking this moron and sheriffs. You know what I'm thinking about? I'm thinking about all these things you say philosophy does. You really don't belong there. You see, I got a friend of mine, an Archbishop-- about the closest thing you're going to come to God in America. Mm-hmm. I'll lay you four to one, if he was here, he'd tell you everything you said philosophy does, the church does. Am I right or wrong? - Definitely correct. Only a total jerk off would owe you that-- total fucking, jerk-off. Hey, watch your language in front of my daughter. I'm sorry. No disrespect. You know, the pope, he wrote a book about all this shit. You know, what to do, and what not to do. My ex got that book in her kitchen. Yeah, well they're not mutually exclusive, religion and philosophy. They-- What? Are you arguing? Well, it's just that they sometimes overlap and even feed each other. Where did you find this meatball, huh? On a basketball court. Oh, you are a cheerleader, too. No, I-- I-- I play. - Play what? Point guard. Yeah, right. On the Harvard basketball team? When do you play Dartmouth, the day after tomorrow? Uh-huh. - Think you'll win? - I know we'll win. - By how many points? - I don't know-- 10. Is that a question or an answer? It's speculation. What are you getting at? Nothing. Are you hungry? Yeah, are you? Starved. In other words, when Harvard got creamed by Holy Cross yesterday, you were the point guard for Harvard? ALAN JENSEN: So when you think I can, you know, actually get the money? Right before the game. Oh, what game? Whatever game you pick. Pick? Pick to fix. - Pick to fix? - Teddy? Yeah. You make this guy out to be a basketball player? Not by appearances. No offense. He knows the game. You ever see this kid play? Yeah, I saw yesterday's game. You were late. How about you? Were you late too? I'm never late, daddy. You know that. Shall I get your lunch, sir? You hungry? You want some? No, thank you. Oh, Alan, don't stop. That feels good. Your father wants to fix a game-- to lose on purpose? My father doesn't want anything from you, Alan. You want something from him, namely $100,000 to bail out your parents. He just assumed that you would want to do something for him to say, like, thank you. Maybe we can talk about this later? And always be true. So why'd you bring him here? His parents lost their house in that tornado in Kansas, and he needs $100,000 to bail them out. And what are we? The Red Cross? I just thought that maybe we-- Don't get cute with me, Cindy. You're my daughter. I know what you thought. I know why you brought him here. Oh, Jesus Christ, intentionally losing a game. Who said anything about losing? Ah. Harvard is going to be at least a seven point favorite over Dartmouth. All you have to do is make sure that Harvard doesn't win by more than seven, six, or whatever the odds turn out to be. Oh, what the fuck kind of throw was that? Oh, that's not good. That's not good. ANDREW: Oh, my god. What did these idiots break now? Who broke my grandmother's antique fruit bowl? Well, Mr. Bandolini, I was throwing the football and what was supposed to-- I did, Mr. Bandolini. I apologize. Football is really not my forte. God, Alan. You know what? I am starting to feel sorry that I ever asked him for you. I'll just tell him that you chickened out. Yeah, you better. Well, you lied to me. About what? Intimidation. You said I intimidate you, but I don't. I don't intimidate you one friggin bit. No, you do. I just make light of things when I'm upset. What are you upset about? My parents. They lost their house in that tornado. I wish I could help you. Good luck. Suppose I were to consider it. What if I play badly and coach Preston takes me out? You're point guard, Alan. You can affect other players. Wow, this is getting demonic. You really are out there, Cindy. Of course I am. And I thought you were too. All the talk about getting out to the other side. What's the matter? You don't mean it when you say something? That's orgasm. This is crime. Crime is a word. $100,000 cash is real. So is a house in Kansas. We could go to jail. Big news. Are you in or out? I'll be at your dorm room a few hours before the game with half the money. You can get the other half after. You sound like a pro. I know what I'm doing. MARCUS: Who is it? It's Alan. I need to talk to you. Is this a bad time? - Very bad. I'll make it fast. You know when we were talking about where we were going to finish? - Finish where? - End of standings. - Uh-huh? You were saying we sucked. Well, if that's true, then what difference does it make? What difference does what make? The score-- winning and losing. What difference does it make if we win by 10, lose by 20, win by 6, lose by 3. It means nothing. Right? Alan, this is a question you had to ask me at 4:00 o'clock in the morning? - I need to know. - What are you high on? - Nothing. - Can you keep a secret? - Uh-huh. There's only one reason why I play basketball. What's that? (RAPPING) Don't you leave without a trace. by design. Take a before my Get some rest, OK? Chesney, I need to tell you what happened. I can't see you now. You can't do this, Alan. You gotta go. Hey. I got the money from Cindy's father, precisely in the manner in which you suggested. CHESNEY: That's great. Now could you leave? Why? CHESNEY: Don't ask. Just go. - What? Are you expecting someone? CHESNEY: That's none of your business, Alan. Who's this? CHESNEY: It's my mother. Yeah, that's what I thought. She's beautiful. CHESNEY: Yeah, she's beautiful. She's got a haunted look in her eyes. Uh-huh. Alan, give me the picture. Where is she? She's in the hospital. - Why? - Oh, god. LSD, all right. She was one of the unlucky ones. Now would you leave? - How old were you? I was six, Alan. Can we discuss-- - Why are you doing this? - --this another night? All right. - I really want you to go. - OK. OK. Wait. Wait. Wait. Just-- why? - Alan, I'm serious. - Just explain to me. - Alan, I'm serious. What are you trying to hide. I'm not trying to hide anything. What are you trying to hide? Alan, go. Then why are you acting like this? Leave. Learning to know dread is an adventure which everyone must confront, if one is not to go to eternal hell. The only answer is faith, which as Haegel calls it, is the n-word, certainty, which anticipates infinity. Therefore, dread is the possibility of freedom. Soren Kierkegaard. God reveals nothing. Dread makes what is, what seems to be, slip away from us. The oblivion of being-- Heidegger. The oblivion of being. Dread reveals nothing-- the possibility of freedom. The oblivion of being. Aren't you supposed to be in your astronomy class? Too late. I'm didn't get to sleep till after sunrise. Fucking? Uh-uh. Getting high? No, just walking and thinking. Depressed? Not really. I'm just-- I'm a little fucked up. Well, this will unfuck you. You did it? Pure, exact, 5,000 micrograms of unadulterated LSD 25-- no different from the Swiss acid Sanders produced in the '60s. You can't get this shit anywhere, Alan. And this is how they took it then, too, saturated in sugar cubes. 5,000 each? Right, but you don't take more than one at a time. You just let it do you for a while before you even think about the other two. And keep them in the fridge. Actually, I don't think this is the ideal time for me to be trying it. SANDY: You want to open the door, don't you? This will do the trick. This will let you see what's inside. You've done it? Of course I've done it. It's transcendent. It makes regular acid seem like diet Sprite. I have the Dartmouth game tomorrow. SANDY: All the more reason. Are you fucking kidding me? Tripping during a Harvard-Dartmouth game? How can you pass up an opportunity like that? No, I got to keep clear-headed. What do you think LSD is, Alan? Multiple clarity. How much do I owe you? Nada. It's my gift. TEDDY: Who is it? Cindy. TEDDY: Uh-- come back in an hour? No. I need to talk to you now. Hey. RD Laing once wrote that sanity is a cozy lie. Wittgenstein may well have applied that phrase to words, language, as a cozy lie. At their best, words approximate, they indicate, they profess to reveal, but they always, at least partially, conceal. Even what I'm saying to you now is being understood in as many different ways as there are individuals listening. KELLY: OK. You've got the-- CINDY: I'm sorry, I-- TEDDY: No, no, no. Don't worry about it. This is my girlfriend, Kelly. Hi. TEDDY: She handles all my afternoon action-- female voice-- nice added touch for the customers. Honey, why don't you give Cindy and me a minute alone, OK? KELLY: Yeah, whatever you want, Teddy. Thank you. Don't forget to call Seymore about dropping off the-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right. - Nice skirt. Thanks, sweetie. I'm coming. Who is it? HOWIE: It's Howie. Ah, yes. Hey. you guys. Big day. 78? $6,800. $7,800? 768. 70 at $4,000. Stanford at $3,800-- $4,000 Stanford. $2,800 CHESNEY: The question presents itself, why talk at all? Wittgenstein could never persuade himself that he, or we, should. So if words are without meaning, we are left finally, with what? With nothing. Back to the void. Which leads us to existentialism and the forging of a self by our actions from the bowels of that void. $3,800 Kentucky. We'd called in Tuesday. We talked to Kelly, right? $4,000-- called it in Sunday-- 38. We called-- we talked to Kelly, man. We talked to Kelly. We talked to her Monday. Jesus Christ, Teddy, what are you talking about? It's $7,800. Jesus Christ, Teddy, what the hell is going on here? You took my action two years and never screwed me around yet. Would you like to hear the tape? Tape? What tape? You tape it? Yes, I tape it. Could've been a mistake, I suppose. Yeah, that's possible. Possible. Give you the benefit of the doubt this time. I'll talk to you later. - Yes, you will. Speak to you later. Scum bag. ALAN JENSEN: Have you ever known that something was wrong, but went ahead and did it anyway because you felt you had to? CHESNEY: Why? What awful sin are you planning to commit? ALAN JENSEN: No, I was just asking theoretically. CHESNEY: Oh, so you don't want to tell me what it is. Well, you have a couple of secrets from me. I would imagine, that I should have one from you. What secrets do I have from you? Well, it's none of my business, right? What are you planning, Alan? See, the way I see it, it's all about how far you want to go. And I want to get as far out as I can. And what makes you think you won't snap? Why do you always ask that? Why is that always on your mind? You're so afraid of that. Because it's easily right around the corner. I think you've been reading too much Heidegger and Keirkegaard. Confidence is good. Cockiness is-- Cocky. --dangerous. What are you thinking? How I'd love to be fucking you right now. You're so kind. So how many other students of yours have you fucked, huh? Why do you want to know that? Because it excites you or because you're not sure I think you're special? How many? This year? Any year. Maybe none. ALAN JENSEN: Look into my eyes. CHESNEY: I am looking into your eyes. ALAN JENSEN: While I'm inside you. CHESNEY: You're scaring me, Alan. ALAN JENSEN: Look into my eyes. Keep looking. Look in my eyes. Don't look away. Look into eyes. Who are they, huh? Don't stop looking. Keep looking. Keep looking. Who were they, huh? Who were they, those people you were with? What people? Can I offer you anything? a Coke? Got any tequila? Not at work. Business what would your father say if he thought I was drinking on the job? Huh? That raises an interesting question. Can I trust you, totally, completely, absolutely? Of course. Of course. I can trust you not to talk to my father, or like a girlfriend of yours? Between us is between us, like a priest and confessor. I've got a game that I'm willing to bet $250,000 on, cash. When it wins, I will kick you back $25. Get it up high. A little higher. Yo, man, you OK? Mm. That's a hard question. That's a strange answer. What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Everything's fine. You think we'll beat Dartmouth? We got to beat Dartmouth. I thought you said it didn't make a difference? I mean, in the cosmic scheme of things, what could be less significant than whether or not Harvard beats Dartmouth? A lot of things. First of all, I'm sick and tired of losing. It sucks. You've got to have pride, man. Yeah, but you said you only played basketball for the girls. What am I, in court of law? Am I under oath? Girls and winning are why I play basketball. What the fuck is wrong with you today, man? Damn. Are you interested? Well, first of all, I don't want to make any profit on it, so you can forget about the $25. - No way. I insist. And secondly, why don't you tell your father about this? If you have some inside information, why don't you just share it with him? Because this is my thing. Look, if you don't get involved, just say so, and I will find somebody else. ANNOUNCER: It hasn't been a banner season for the Harvard basketball team, but here tonight, on the whole floor of pavilion, there's still a chance to save face and play for some pride against a big league-- - Yo, man, you feeling better? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You cool? - Cool. We going to whip Dartmouth's ass? Ferociously. ANNOUNCER: The thing is, they have to contain that dynamic duo of Dartmouth, Harmon and Cobb. I just never saw you going into the family business. But if I did take your action, I could only do it as a prope. What does that mean? That means that considering that a bet of this size is going to have to be laid off, I'm going to need to have the cash up front. No problem. What's the game? Dartmouth over Harvard. ANNOUNCER: intends to make pavilion. The ball is released from the referee's hand and we are on our way to Harvard and Dartmouth. gentle looking inside for Blake. Blake putting to the hoop. The ball is lost. now attacking in transition. at the other end of the floor, looking for the layup, and is dropped in with the right hands. Jensen and Blake unable to connect there at the other end of the floor. Usually such a great work between those two, but couldn't cash in at the offence that time. Neither in this instance either as another pass is thrown away. Here comes Dartmouth, and once again, Harmon hung fake, shot in the air is good. Dartmouth over Harvard-- $250,000. You sure are your father's daughter. I assume that's a compliment. Oh, of the highest. ANNOUNCER: Jensen and Blake struggling in the early going, but still plenty of time to turn it around. Jensen bringing the ball up with the left-handed dribble, feeds Blake on the wing. Blake hesitates, looking at what he has, now drives into the lane, goes with the left-hand and scores. by Marcus Blake. He TEDDY: You'll be taking six and a half points. So you win the bet if Dartmouth wins outright, or if they lose by less than seven. Yeah, I know all this, Teddy. I'm not a novice. TEDDY: I'll say. You must have turned into a pretty sharp handicap to go for $250,000 on one basketball game. ANNOUNCER: Here's Jensen looking for Blake. And again, the pass off of another turnover for the Now, Marcus Blake, he's a superstar. He's got to be able to get down and dig that ball out of his shoes. Doesn't your friend, Alan, play for Harvard. uh-huh. ANNOUNCER: Here's Blake for the steal. Blake in transition, heading down to the other end of the floor, elevates Marcus Blake showing how defense creates offense court to the other end. around handling the ball for the big green. Marching deliberately up the court. Crosses the center court line. It's a on the baseline. Front layup-- that's good. TEDDY: How do you think your boyfriend would feel if he knew about this? He'd hate it. But he won't find out, will he? It's just between us, right? ANNOUNCER: the way is no rims out. Blake with the rebound. He'll carry up floor in this seesaw contest. But he turns the ball over. The big green coming back the other way, underneath for the lay up. That's good and the game is tied at 33. Marcus Blake just seems a step off so far. TEDDY (ON PHONE): Hello, leave your message at the sound of the beep, thanks. MAN (ON PHONE): Teddy, it's Ray. I'm, uh-- ANNOUNCER: Jensen holds head of the key, looking to distribute. Finds Blake. You never-- stop the connection. Blake trying to go up. Stripped once. Stripped again. And here come the big green the other way. It's Weber leading the attack. Weber into the front court, looking to set up a play. Finds Harman near-side. Gives it back to Weber. On now to McSorley. A bounce pass underneath. Looking to post up. Kicked back out. Caught with a jumper in the air. It's good. Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing? Isn't this the most phenomenal ending right here? The game starts in a few hours. Don't you want to know what's going on? I already know what's going on. You're stoned. I cannot believe you did this. I'm in the best state I could possibly be in right now. Where's the money, Cindy? $50,000 up front, $50,000 after the game. That was the deal. If my dad blows a bundle on this game, he's going to be in no mood to pay $.50. Where's the money, Cindy? ANNOUNCER: Blake drives by his offender. Elevates it. Throws it down. fouled Harvard with two. Where's the money, Cindy? Listen to you-- an overnight tough guy. Don't fuck with my dad. He is not somebody you want to disappoint, I promise you. ANNOUNCER: Marcus Blake, always a clutch performer and with this free throw, he can pull Harvard within two. A little bit of a look being exchanged changes Jensen and Blake at the free-throw line. Blake bends the knees, shot is in the air and finds nothing but the bottom of the net. Dartmouth-- 68, Harvard-- 66. 45 seconds to play do not need to foul as of yet. Kyle to Stanton. Stanton holds the ball high over the head, finds Calgor. Now up top to McSorley. Dishes over to Cob. Cob returns to McSorley. McSorley drives into the lane. Kicks out. Harmon, three on the way. It's long. It's an air ball. An ill-advised shot and Harvard has a chance here with 11 seconds to go. Harvard down two. Jensen into the front row, looking to find someone. And there's Marcus Blake all on the wing, calling for the basketball. Jensen takes a look, but doesn't give it to him. Three seconds left. Jensen for the tie. It is no good. The buzzer sounds. Harvard goes down to defeat. And why, oh why, did Marcus Blake not get the basketball? Alan Jensen must give up the rock there. He's going to find his superstar on the wing and coach Preston has no idea what went through his mind right there. I don't either. Blake not waiting for the post-game handshake. He is heading right to the dressing room in disgust. And frankly, I can't say that I blame him. He is the star of this team. He's the one who should've taken the shot. He did not. As a result, Harvard loses. We will be back for the post-game post-mortem, right after this. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I got lucky. There's no substitute for luck. We all need it. Oh, this is my money? Most of it. What do you mean most of it? It's $100,000 short. Kelly had to go out to Newton to pick up the rest. Guy came up late. It's not a problem. She's going to drop it by your apartment. - When? - Right now. A couple of hours. I thought no one else was going to know about this, Teddy? She doesn't know about the bet, just that you are owed money-- could be about anything. Who is it? MARCUS: Marcus. Thought I'd stop by. You seemed a little depressed. Yeah, bad game. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? We lost the Dartmouth game. And whose fault is that? Whose fault? It's nobody's. Everybody's. Wrong. It was mine. No. We all fucked up. Come on. You actually were pretty good out there. I was the one who lost it for us. If I'd have played my normal game, we win by 10. There's no point in-- - No point in what? - In blaming. We all had fuck-ups. It's true, right. Unless it was intentional. - What? I said, unless it was intentional, that's what I said. - Hey, come on, man. Put that down. It was just a game. Don't play me for no sucker, Alan. If you were in trouble and you needed help, you could have come asked me for it. OK. I am in trouble. You know I like the ball above my waist. Come on, man. Just put the gun down. You were out to fuck me today. Could you just please put the gun down? Don't push it, Alan. Stop lying to me. What kind of shit are you into, man? Look, whatever I'm into, I'm out of. Just don't ask me anymore, OK? - It's not OK. Cause I don't know if I should take this personally? Do not take it personally, Marcus. Why shouldn't I take it personally? Because it wasn't against you. It wasn't against anybody. It was for some people that needed help. A one-time thing. One-time thing. We did it. Now you can buy your parents a home. Uh-huh. Ooh. What's the matter? You're acting as if we lost. Where are you going? Kansas. Oh. Well, can it wait? You know, I thought we'd celebrate. I have nothing to celebrate until I get this house money in their hands. (RAPPING) same thing. Nothing changed. Keep my frame in the game. Make the girls sing. Bring the hollow tip to the head. till I'm dead. to kill the Oh. (RAPPING) I got to sleep before my sickness wins. Here we go again. I have to stop or did it only just begin? CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM): And the latest weather report from Kansas City is, uh-- clear skies and 55 degrees Fahrenheit. We should have you into Kansas City at 2:13 Central Standard Time right on the button. I'd like to ask you to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of your flight. TEDDY: Hey. yeah, hey, baby. Yeah. Guess where I am. I have something for you-- $100. $100 what? $100,000 for a house. Alan-- Where'd you get it? It's a long story. Well, you flew out here twice in one week. I think you've got the time to tell us how you came by it. I borrowed it. You borrowed $100,000? Who would lend you that kind of money? Why? But don't you think we should be thanking Alan? I'd like an answer to my question, son. I borrowed it from a teacher who wishes to remain anonymous. Her father is extremely rich-- no strings, no interest, no debt collection. If you had to do anything wrong to get this money, I want you to take it back right now. I just told you how I got it. It is more important than anything that you always tell me the truth-- more important than a house, do you understand? Yes, I know that. And I am telling you the truth. Now will you please give me the pleasure of knowing that I've helped out? Oh, Come here. Teddy, it's Cindy. I'm in my apartment, waiting for my money. Where's my money? Look, where are you? Can you just call me? Oh, she's here. Coming. You got it? Got what? The money. What do you think, got what? Where are you going? Hey, where is my money? What do you think you're doing? So who is the player, Alan Jensen? Where is my money? What did you pay him-- $50, $75? Listen, lady, you are testing my sense of humor and my patience, and that is a big mistake. I'm a big gambler, like you. I'm sure you are. Now give me my fucking money. Where's Teddy? I want to speak to Teddy-- Oh, you'll have plenty of time to talk to Teddy. How much did you pay Alan Jensen to dump the game? Get out of my apartment. I don't think so. You don't think so? Fine I, will throw you out. Kelly Morgan-- FBI. Look, I don't care who you are. You don't know what you're fucking with. Oh no, we know exactly what we're fucking with. My father will bury you. Or maybe you'll get smart and help to bury him. - Do you have a warrant? - Not at them moment. Then I don't have to talk to you. No, you don't, but you'd be foolish not to-- very foolish. If you promise to behave, Cindy, I'll let you up. Fuck you. Not nice, not intelligent. Look, you're hurting me. I'm going to let you up, but if you can't be civilized, I'm going to have to pin you down again. This wrestling shit's for girls. You should try golf some time. I'll whip your ass. Yeah, I'm sure. But in the meantime, let's stick with reality. Now unless you are planning to leave the country and hide for the rest of your life, you're going to have to cooperate. Listen, you badge flashing bitch, you have nothing on me. I'm am so out of your league. Here is the thing, Cindy. We've got you. And we've got your father. All the rest is talk. Well, if you're so sure you've got my father, then what do you need with me? Honey, I thought you knew the world-- publicity. That's page one for two weeks with you testifying against your father. And it'll help keep you out of jail. Your father's going no matter what. Do you really want to go with him? You guys are fucking evil. As opposed to your father, who's a fucking saint. At least my father isn't some two-faced scumbag who pretends to be your friend while he stabs you in the back. Ooh, daddy's little girl. Mind I get high? It's against the law. Add a year to my sentence. You really should loosen up and try to have a little fun. It would be good for you. Oh, I know how to have fun. What's that supposed to mean? Whatever you want it to be. You're a little weird, aren't you? I thought FBI agents were supposed to be straight. We are straight. We enforce the law. Yeah, well, you gotta be out of your fucking mind if you think I'd rat out my own father. Am I hallucinating, or were you starting to get friendlier there for a few seconds? I'm just trying to figure out the best way I can to get you out of this mess you're in, Cindy. Well, call me crazy, but I believe you. You're not crazy. It's the truth. Excuse me? Hey? Mind if I, uh-- sit here. - Go ahead. - Thanks. The airwaves are free. Oh. How you doing? You-- you got a little something-- do we know each other? Have we met before? Yeah, at, uh-- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Gum? Yeah, we met at the, uh-- at the, yeah-- mm-hmm. Let me ask you a question, from girl to girl. That's what I've been trying to get to all along. What if-- and I'm not saying that I could or even that I would, but-- if I happen to remember all sorts of incriminating and sensational stuff about Alan Jensen, and not just basketball fixing, but drug stuff, sex stuff, a real sensational Harvard story. What if I could give you two months of incredible page-one shit like that, could I get my father out of this totally clean and myself? Why don't you tell me what you have to tell me and I'll do my best. Why don't you suck my dick? I'll give you one day to come around. Alan, it is Cindy. If you ratted out me or my father, I will fucking torture you. I will cut out your eyeballs and make you eat them. You hear me? And if you didn't pass out and they come to you and tell you that I said anything, it is a lie and traps. So deny everything. TEDDY: You all right? Do-- do you want a doctor? No, I am a doctor. Doctor Jensen, nice to meet you. In fact, that's where I met you. You were one of my patients once. Didn't I prescribe you some really good shit once? What are you on? huh? What drug did you take? What did you take? - That's a good question. - What are you on? - An airplane. - Where'd you get it? I didn't get it. It got me. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. No problem. What are you writing? I'm working on this big case. Do you want to hear about it? I thought you weren't allowed to discuss cases. Or is this particular case, one in which I could be of some use to you? - Use you? We would never use you. Well you use me all the time, just as I use you. Where's Teddy? I'm not sure. He took one fork in the road and I took another. Can I get you something? - What are you having? - Coke. Nothing in it? I'm on duty. Bacardi Limone on the rocks. So what's on the tape, the American cream team? - The American what? - Cream team. How old are you? - How old do you think I am? - 29. - Not bad. Why? Are you growing dissatisfied with us? Do you prefer someone else? Do you think there's others who might fuck you better than we do? Differently. And how many others are there at present, if I may be so aggressive as to inquire? Fewer than you'd wish. Than I wish? Why would I want you to have lots of lovers? Because the thought of me like a lot of different men excites you, and it excites Teddy, and that excites you even more. And what about you? Do you claim innocence in all this? No. But it's not my fault you two need a third party to get off. You're being very harsh, Chesney. Are you angry with me for some reason? I'm just compensating for your coyness. How am I being coy? How am I being coy, she asked coyly. By not answering my simple question, what's on the tape? And by beating around the bush instead of just coming clean and asking me for the help you need in this big case of yours. Has anyone ever told you that you would make a first-rate agent at the Bureau? Not that I recall, but I'll keep it in mind if I ever get desperate. Now what's on the tape? - Gangsters. - Ooh. There's a shock. The FBI is bugging gangsters? Who's the target? Andrew Bandolini? How did you know that? I didn't. You just guessed? His name came to mind. Oh, come on. Life is nothing but a series of coincidences. This is just a particularly odd coincidence. Like guessing your age. Now why don't you get to the point like a big boy. If you want a favor, just ask. Think of it as sex. Maybe that'll make it easier. OK. There's a student I would like you to find out about as much as you can, quietly. Does she have a name? Alan Jensen. Vaguely familiar. What did he do? He's a rotten kid. Is that a felony or a misdemeanor? Let's just say we could have him put away for a long time, if we wanted to. - Why wouldn't you want to? Because he will end up serving a more useful function. Such as? Use your vivid imagination, Chesney. I would say to get Andrew Bandolini, but what possible connection could a Harvard man have with some mafia hood. You wouldn't believe me even if I told you. I'm tired of playing this game. Just tell me. Gambling, but that's just the start. Sorry. Sorry. Can I help you? No, I'm fine. I've got it. CHESNEY: I'm really sorry. KELLY: Don't worry about it. It's-- it's fine. Actually, um-- I have to go, anyway. So it's fine. I'll see you later. Hey, can I offer you a ride? What, in a car? - Yeah. - No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no small boxes. Oh, no, no, this is a big luxurious car. See? - No, I'll be trapped. Come on. You'll be fine. It's a beautiful car. Right there. It's a free ride, wherever you want to go. Who are you? - Do I know you? Yeah, I'm Teddy. We just spent two hours together. No, I mean, who are you? I'll tell you what, you get in the car, and I will answer all your deep questions, and maybe you can even answer some of mine. All right? Come on. It'll be fun. We'll go for fun ride. Look. The pretty lady, she driving us-- take you wherever you want to go. Come on. Come on. You'll be fine. It's all right. There you go. Oh. ALAN JENSEN: No little boxes. It's too small. I gotta get out of here. Oh. How do you open this? TEDDY: You don't. Excuse me, could you open the door, please? I want to go back to my room and listen to music. You can listen until your heart's content. We're just going to ask you a few questions. I believe Mr. Jensen may have ingested some chemical substances, which alter his perception of reality. What did I do? Do I do anything sexual with you? Not yet. But you never know what can happen if you give the right answers to the right questions. What drug did you take, Alan? TEDDY: You're not going to get anything out of him. He's totally gone. - You look very familiar. Are you sure we never made love. - Quite. Quite, indeed. You would remember. I'm sure I would. Do you want to? KELLY: What drug did you take? Do you want my penis inside your vagina? Hey, do you want me to shove my cane up your ass? Does that wild look mean yes or no. Maybe after we get to know each other a bit. What drug did you take? Oh. And how does that happen? I'm getting to know another person-- knowing another person. KELLY: Like I said before, the right answers to the right questions. God, but those are just words and words are just noise. KELLY: Are you on ecstasy? What, did you smoke some crack, Alan? KELLY: Did you drop acid? Alan? You're looking for Alan? Who are you? My name's Chesney and yours is Cindy. How did you know that? Alan talks about all the time. That's funny, because he's never mentioned you to me. You guys need any help? Uh-uh. We're looking for Alan. I haven't seen him. If you want, I can give him a message or a-- better yet, why don't the both of you hang in my room for awhile? - Thanks, but, um-- No. Yeah, it is a bit early for that. Yeah, well, um--if change your mind, you know, just knock. Cause you know my motto is, you got the bear, I got the time. Would you shut the fuck up? Did you-- if you don't mind my asking-- did you have an arrangement to meet him here? - No, did you? - No. - So he could be anywhere? - Doing anything. Unless-- Unless what? How do I know who you are? You could be anybody. I'm his professor. Unless what? Unless somebody already grabbed him? Somebody, meaning the FBI. What would the FBI want with Alan? I have no idea. Maybe you could help me? I don't think so. KELLY: Oh, do you believe this asshole. TEDDY: Oh, man. Ugh. Hey, you got to backup. This is one way. Excuse me, sir? You got to back up. You got to move this. I got no room. What do you want me to do? Back up. - Teddy? - Move it. - Teddy? - Hey, hey. - It's all right. - Hey. Let me just talk to-- Hey! Alan! Fucker. Hey, move it. Oh, Jesus. Hey. OK. Look, we gotta look at it this way. You're a legacy, so you got a leg up. But I mean, it's just gotten incredibly competitive. You look around this place, it's like half Asian. I mean, I don't know if I could get in now. Dad, maybe I don't even want to go here. Honey, you want to go to Harvard. It's Harvard. Well, what about the other schools that we looked at, dad? Like what about Duke? Duke was a lot more fun than Harvard. Honey, Harvard is just-- it's-- it's a great calling card. Doors just open up. You're going to forge relationships here that will last you the rest of your life. The kids are amazing here. It's the best of the-- excuse me? Excuse me? - Dad? Hi. Al Franken, college, '73. Dad? I actually was at here. Dad? Yeah, uh-- this is my daughter, Thomason. She's high school junior. I just wanted her to meet a Harvard student, because it's kind of a random process. I thought I'd pick your brain, because you've been through it. She got a 1520 on her SAT. Dad, don't tell people my SAT scores. Sorry. 800 on her math. Dad, how do you even know he goes to Harvard? Of course he goes to Harvard. He's been through this process-- letters of recommendation. Say she got a letter from Hillary. Dad, Hillary doesn't even know me. Honey, she met you at the fundraiser. She was very impressed with you. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Honey, this is one of your weaknesses. You get embarrassed too easily. Maybe you can use that. Like in the interview today, if they ask you your strengths and weaknesses, my weakness is I get embarrassed too easily. Yeah, I know how to give an interview, OK? Summer program-- we're thinking like an Indian reservation. Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. I hate these things. Excuse me. Listen, I'm really-- Yeah? Hi, Adam. If I were you, I would free myself. I would open myself up. I would sing. I would sing a high C, sing a high C in the middle of Harvard Square. No, no, no sing a I know. He's a pathological liar. - Dad? I gotta go. I'm at Harvard. Dad? She got a 1520. Dad, this guy is high, OK? How do you know? Just look at his eyes. Dad? Dad, let's go. Dad? Dad, let's go. OK. Um-- uh-- thank you. Oh, it's a Harvard man-- river man. Run, river. River run. Charles River by the Charles River, by the river. Run, river. River, run. River, run. Harvard man, run, River Charles, run. Run. Run, river. Run, run, COED 1: Holy shit. Mr. Al Franken, right? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I personally, Alan Jensen, will accept your daughter into Harvard. But if you don't want to go, I would strongly suggest against it. Don't-- don't let your father pressure you. He is weird. Did you know that the earth is the insane asylum of the universe? What did you take? Are you OK? - What can we do to help you? - Run, river. River, run. Run, river. River, run. Run to the banks of the Charles River. Run, Charles River, run. Run. Run. COED 2: That's why I gave up drugs my junior year in high school. COED 1: Me too. COED 2: I didn't know you gave up drugs. COED 1: Oh, yeah, except for a little marijuana and some occasional coke. (SINGING) Run, motherfucker, run. Run. Run, motherfucker, run Run. Run. Run, motherfucker, run. LSD. Oh, hi. I need to talk to you, Alan. I have an announcement to make. I have found the truth. CINDY: Fuck this shit, Alan. We are in trouble. And I need to talk to you alone. - So do I, now. - I'm with both of you. Oh, I have nothing in my heart but love. Who wants to go first? Or better yet, why don't we just all go together? Because different people might have different agendas. Oh, wow. That's-- that's a wow. Yeah. It's called clothing, Alan. People wear it. What the fuck is wrong with you, Alan? You're acting like a nut. And let me tell you something, you cannot afford to act like a nut. There is a lot of dangerous shit going down and you are in the middle of it. Dangerous, dangerous shit. Oh, she's-- she's my teacher and You did acid. You took acid. ALAN JENSEN: I must be inside you. And we must explode while we look into each other's eyes. All right, Alan. This is serious. OK. You could get kicked out of school. You could go to jail. ALAN JENSEN: I was in jail. My whole life I was in jail. Now I'm free. Jesus Christ, Alan. Did you get it from Sandy? ALAN JENSEN: Uh-huh. Right. Did you do more than one? All right, Alan, how much did you take? 15,000 micrograms. 15,000 micro-- 15,000 micrograms. 15,000? Are you trying to destroy yourself? You're about to be busted by the FBI. That's where I just ran from. What are you talking about? I just ran from the FBI building. She want me to go inside. She-- who is she? You're jealous, aren't you? You didn't even-- Alan, what's her name? Kelly. Kelly. All right. You know what? They're going to be here any second, if they're not already. Is there a back way out of here? Oh. I know a way out. It's a great way-- acid. God damn it, Alan. Look, if I'm going to help you, you're going to have to concentrate on what's here. All right, not what's in your head. Can you do that? Is there a back way out of the building? I know a way out. I know a way out. OK. Can you show me? Uh-huh. But I'm inside you and you're inside me. You know that, right? - Right. Right. - You know that. OK. Oh. Alan, did you sign anything? Did you put anything in writing or on tape? Alan, which way do we go? Two words, words have no meaning. So you admitted nothing? I mean, they don't have anything in writing or on tape? I can't write. I can't speak. I don't believe a word. - OK. Well, don't give up on them until we get out of here, all right? Alan, does this take us out front? Into the light, the dancing, blinding light. Who's out front? Who do you think? Oh, this is heaven. Alan? The vast outdoors, the sparkling city lights. Alan, listen, I think we should go to that doctor I was telling you about. - I don't have a cold. I know you don't. Why doesn't anybody understand the doctor lies within. Alan? Alan? Oh, god. This is going to be a disaster. Yeah, it already is if he signed anything. All right. Now you're starting to irritate me. Well, pardon me for breathing. What are you, his fucking savior? Look, there may be a way for us to work together on this, all right? But you're going to have to come clean with me. Can you do that? - Of course I can. Look, I don't fuck with people unless they fuck with me first. All right. Then answer me one question. Who came up with the scheme you acted out? What scheme? I don't know what you're talking about? Listen, Cindy, if you have any-- I don't have shit that concerns you. Go back to your classroom, honey. You're in way over your head. - Sandy. - Alan. I took all three hits-- 15,000 micrograms. It's the answer, isn't it? It's the answer to every question. It's the route to God. It's the direct route to God. And that's where I am. You know. You've been there, right? I'm with God. It's amazing. I feel a complete clarity, a complete wisdom about me. Like a complete refinement of character and of mind, and of body, of soul. I feel so beautiful. I feel so great. I feel like-- I can't believe you never gave this to me before. Just fucking amazing. I walk down the street and I see-- I see everything planned out, exactly the way it is-- blocks, pixels-- perfect. It's revelation. It's truth. It's wisdom. It's beauty. It's eternity. What's the longest you've ever known anybody to trip? Sandy? Well, sometimes, it never ends. Sometimes it never ends. Sometimes it never ends. It never ends. Never ends. Sometimes it never ends. Alan? Alan? Sometime it never ends. 5,000 never ends. Alan? 5,000 micrograms. SANDY: Alan, can you hear me? ALAN JENSEN: I'm with God. I took that route. There's a direct route to God. It's eternity. You know that. You've been there, right. Oh, god. Answer-- the truth. It's the answer. It's eternity. Dr. East, please? It's Chesney Cort again. Please tell him that it's urgent. Thank you. Hello? Oh, hey, Kelly. Yeah, are you with Teddy now? What tape are you talking about? No, I didn't steal your fucking tape. Hello, Chesney? These voices won't shut up. If I knew that there was nothing ahead but sound, I would look to death right this second. What's the matter, sweetheart? Everything. I got him. He is at a payphone right in front of me. Chesney? Sit down. Sit down. What's the matter? Tell me, please. I'm sorry. 555-1525. Call him now. 555-1525. OK. OK. OK. CHESNEY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Call him now. Call him now. ALAN (IN ALAN'S HEAD): You're talking about addicts. You're talking about addicts. It's strange. You're the only person in my life that I've given to and never taken from. And now, it's going to be you who screws me worst than my most vicious enemy. It can still work out, can't it? - Can it? - I'm coming. Mr. Jensen, I believe we have some unfinished business. I knew I should've never trusted a guy who speaks in four different accents and walks with a limp. Now let me ask you a question. What was the first lesson I taught you about? Huh? Do you remember? I always told you, don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of, if things go wrong. I've never violated that-- never. And now you violated it for me. Russell? CHESNEY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): What What state of consciousness are we describing here, if not-- I can't-- I don't. I can't read this. You don't have to read it. I can't read. KELLY: He manipulated you, bribed you, and duped you into fixing the Harvard-Dartmouth game. TEDDY: He's the only going to jail. KELLY: That's exactly where he belongs. He duped you and bribed you into dumping the Harvard--Dartmouth game. KELLY: It's exactly where he belongs. ALAN JENSEN: It's like I'm in a straitjacket that I'm trying CHESNEY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Think of it as cyanide. KELLY: That's exactly where he belongs. Sign it. Sign the paper, Alan. We cannot help you if you don't sign this paper. TEDDY: You don't want to go to prison. jail. KELLY: That's exactly where he belongs. I got to go. I got to get out of here. I got to go to Sign the paper. CINDY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Are you fucking kidding me? The voices-- the voices-- Cindy. I believe Mr. Jensen may have The voices? TEDDY: No, don't worry about voices. Worry about-- ALAN JENSEN (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Break out-- marijuana, orgasm. And then you can go. If you sign everything-- KELLY: Alan! CINDY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Are you fucking kidding me? Oh Jesus. Shit. Alan Jensen, let me assure you one thing before I say or do anything else. I have never had to suffer the agony you are suffering myself, but I have treated many patients over the years who have. And I promise you, one way or another, your agony will end tonight. Go in. Go in. When did you take this LSD? ALAN JENSEN: Yesterday, I think. I don't know. I can't-- I don't know. Where did you get it? From a student, a chemistry major student at Harvard-- chemistry major synthesized it from the original Swiss formula. Sander's Laboratory. Yeah, yeah, Sanders. Sugar cubes. True blue, she said, in sugar cubes. How much did you take? 15,000 micrograms. Are you sure? 15,000 micrograms. Are you sure? Yes. Can you make these voices go Away I can, yes. You must sign this. What does it say? If I should die-- What are the chances that I'm going to die? As a result of the medication-- ALAN JENSEN: --chances that I'm going to die? - 50-50. - That' I'm going to die? Administered to me by Dr. Kurt Reese. And I absolve Dr. Reese of all responsibility in my death. Why would I sign it? Do you want to feel the way you feel now for the rest of your life? I can't stand to feel this way for one more second. Then, I suggest you sign the paper. What if I do die? Do you think the voices-- do you think they'll stop? - Of course. - What are you giving me? The antidote. You don't want to tell me what you're giving me? There's no need to know-- need to know. You are never going to take another drop of any kind again-- Any kind. ALAN JENSEN (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Intimidation. Intimidation. Intimidation. Intimidation. Intimidation. Intimidation. And when did you take this LSD? Now? Go ahead. Can I help you guys out? Yeah, we're looking for Alan Jensen. Yeah, everybody's looking for him. Yeah? Who else? So who's this kid we're going to shoot? His name is Alan. Is that the kid from the house? Yes, it's the kid from the house. The basketball kid? Yes, it's the basketball kid. Why are you asking? Ted Carter, FBI. Special Agent, Kelly Morgan. FBI-- no shit. What did he do? Why are we shooting him? I don't know if we're going to shoot him. We didn't get the OK from Andrew. If we get the OK from Andrew, we'll shoot him. You're going to shoot him though, right? - Why am I going to shoot him? - It's your turn. I shot the last guy. I don't recall you shooting the last guy. Do you even remember who the last guy we took care of was? - Of course I remember. - Who? What? Are you testing me? Go ahead. Tell me. Who. That kid on Queens Boulevard. And who fired the shot? I did. You? No more voices? Just yours and mine-- the real ones. Thank you for saving me. You saved yourself. Anyone who can survive 15,000 micrograms of LSD has the constitution of an ox. And you're going to need it, because your other problems, the ones out there, haven't gone away. Why you looking out the window? what How come you keep looking out the window? I feel like looking out the window. What are you looking at? The scenery. There's birds and flowers and shit. Since when are you so interested in scenery? You may stay here until things become a bit more calm. You understand that for you, LSD is like cyanide from this day on. Your drug taking career has come to an absolute conclusion. - It's my breath, right? - What? My breath stinks, right? No, your breath don't stink. How's that? A little bit better? We tend to take consciousness for granted. It evolved so subtly and so slowly from the day we are born until the time we form thoughts and express those thoughts in language, that we forget what a fragile edifice it is we have built, this thing called I, the self. And we forget how, once shattered, how hard it is to reconstruct. Treat it with respect. I seem to remember jumping out of an FBI window not too long ago. I think you might be interested in hearing this. Apparently, the FBI has been bugging Bandolini's house for quite a while now. And from what I can gather, this conversation must have taken place the day you went to get your loan. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Why'd bring him here? CINDY (ON RECORDER): His parents lost their house in that tornado in Kansas and he needs $100,000 to bail them out. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): And what are we, the Red Cross? Told you, he ain't fucking here, man. He ain't stupid. He's a fucking Harvard man. What? You think he's going to be waiting around when he knows he got guys coming for him? Huh? How do you know that he knows that he's got guys coming after him? CINDY (ON RECORDER): We can make a huge score, daddy. Alan will do anything to get this money. I can get him to dump the Dartmouth game. We could bet like $1 million on Dartmouth, and Alan walks away with his home for his parents, and we walk away with $1 million cash for one day's work. What do you think? ANDREW (ON RECORDER): I think I've been too easy on you, letting you do anything you want since your mother died. CINDY (ON RECORDER): What do you mean? It's fool-proof. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Only a fool says anything is fool-proof. All this misery, all this danger. Why do you think I've given you so much money? What girl has $1 million cash stashed in a vault. CINDY (ON RECORDER): OK. OK. It was just an idea. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): Yeah, a terrible idea. CINDY (ON RECORDER): It'll never come up again. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): You're damn right it won't. Well, he's gotta come back here eventually. It's where he lives. - So what are you saying? We sit here, fucking jerking our shit until next fucking Easter? Come on. - Yeah, well what's your idea? We drive around the block in circles and hope we bump into him. ANDREW (ON RECORDER): And answer me this. If you're so concerned about this guy's house, why don't you just spot him $100,000 yourself, as a loan? CINDY (ON RECORDER): That wouldn't be any fun. Besides, haven't you always told me, never give away something for nothing? ANDREW (ON RECORDER): That's my little girl. Wow. She's even more lethal than I thought. You chose her. Yeah, I chose her. But you chose two FBI agents who tried to force me to get Andrew Bandolini put away. When he not only didn't try and set it up, but he tried to stop his daughter from setting it up. What a saint. Someone should canonize him. You're not defending them, are you? Teddy and Kelly? Yeah, Teddy and Kelly. No, and I'm not defending your little group either. Let's not argue about each other's friends' vices, all right? Let's just try and get you out of this. You know them better than I do, but from what I know of them, friendly persuasion is not going to get them to back off. - Depends on what kind. - What do you have in mind? Hello? Hi, Chesney. What? Tonight? Hold-- hold on a second. All right. Sounds very intriguing. What, uh-- time? Actually, I'm in the real estate acquisition and development business in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. And my most recent acquisition was the Pele Island Hotel and Pub. the morning is a joke. You better go to the doctor. You don't sound good at all. So I go home. I ask my wife, I say, Becky, am I sleeping OK? I sound like I'm dying. She says, no, no, you're sleeping like a baby. I go to the sleep doctor. he tells me it's about one of the worst cases of sleep apnea he's ever seen. And he puts me on a breathing machine. Now, I go home and ask my wife, I said, honey, why did you tell me I'm sleeping OK? She said, you sounded great, again I'm like, I think you're thinking about insurance policies. Suppose this fucking kid does come back in, let's say, I don't know, the next fucking 10 years, then what are we going to do with him? What do you think we're going to do? I don't know. You see what my point is though? No, what is your point? My point is that we don't have a fucking plan. Maybe you don't have a plan. I do. Oh, really? You have a plan? Would you care to fucking enlighten me on it? We tell him that we got Andrew waiting for him down at this restaurant, that we have a proposition to offer him to settle everything, and that we think he should come down with us. We get him in the car peacefully and quietly, and we drive. Then we shoot him on the way to guys and dump the body. At Donny's? Of course at Donny's. Where the fuck else are we going to dump the body? All right. Then well, let me ask you one more question, because as of right now, you've got to be the biggest fucking hard on I ever met. Why don't we cash this kid out of the fucking street and put a fucking bullet in his head? Commotion. What commotion? People-- they hear shots, they take notice. Don't make me explain something to that should be obvious. It insults my intelligence. You know we can get a silencer for this, right? Hey. Oh, look who it is. We've been waiting for you. How you doing, - Yeah, I can see that. What's up? We've got Andrew waiting for us at this restaurant down near the square. - Oh, yeah? You better go. You'll be late. No, us, meaning, you. And they were selling it to, you know, the United States during Prohibition. Oh my god, hi. When did you get back in town? Not long ago. I can't believe how great you look. Um-- this is Joe. Joe, this is Elaine. It's a pleasure to meet you Elaine. Likewise. Elaine is one of my oldest friends in the world. Would you mind terribly giving us a few moments alone? No. Come visit my hotel on the beach any time. What actually is your name? Chesney. Juliet. Just tell Andrew to hang in and lie low. I've got it all under control. Hey, come on, fellows. It's a camera. It shoots pictures, not bullets. Can I tell you something? I don't know what it is you guys think I'm going to do that you need to prevent me from doing, but whatever it is-- - Rat. Rat what? Not what rat what, rat to the FBI. Think we don't fucking know? Out of the question. I'm handling that. If you want, you can follow me down there and watch. Just don't get too close, because you'll screw everything up. I heard this was kind of a pick-up place. It can be, if that's what you're looking for. Is that what you're looking for? Hey, Russ, look, I'm getting a little too fucking hungry to deal with this-- What is this, a pleasure a vacation for you? You're getting paid for this, aren't you? Of course I'm getting fucking paid. What the fuck do I look like, an amateur? But what I'm saying is, look, we either kill this motherfucker right here, right now, in his fucking room, or we give him to-- Late morning is actually all I really need. All right. FBI cleared out of the way. Everything's cleaned up. - What if he's fucking with us? No, he ain't fucking with us. He just made us an offer to follow him. Do you want to come back to my place? I can't. I need you to come to mine. You live alone? I live alone, but we won't be alone. So what you're saying is you want to follow him for your next 14 hours? You're missing my point. We don't have to follow him. The fact that he just made us an offer to follow him is enough, because he didn't know when he made us that offer that we weren't going to take him up on it. See what my point is? The kid ain't got nothing to hide or he wouldn't have made us that fucking offer. Please tell me you understand this. - I understand. - Thank you. So what do you want to do then? When? - For the next 14 hours. - I don't know. Let's go get something to eat, some pussy, get some food-- whatever. Whoa. Where do you think you're going? I gotta fix things. I can't be late. Look, just hang out. I'll call you tomorrow. Use the phone as much as you like. Do you trust this guy? I don't even know what the fuck just happened? TEDDY: Oh, fuck me. Any particular reason you chose black and white instead of color? More authentic, more incriminating. I expected to see you in a wheelchair or at least on crutches. Yeah, I guess I got lucky, huh? Oh, you got a lot more than lucky. You have a mole, an inside source, a traitor. - A traitor? - Yeah, a traitor. - Who, Chesney? - Yes. Not to me. Well-- To me, she was a savior. Besides, what does that make you two? We're law enforcement officers and that's what we do. We infiltrate and arrest. What about Bandolini? What does what you did to Bandolini make you? Yeah, well, to him, I'm a traitor. Who gives a shit? Will bust him on book making at Shylock. That's all we're going to get, given that Mr. Jensen here, seems to hold all the cards. Or in this case, all the photographs. No. Not even Bandolini. All right. What are your demands? To be left alone-- forget this whole thing ever happened, say goodbye, move on-- a clean slate for everybody. What do you think? I think we're fucked. We don't have much choice, do we? None, that I can see. All right. You've got a clean slate. But for your own sake, you better look over your shoulder. That popping sound you hear just might be a bullet headed for your brain. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. - Yeah, you do that. - Oh, uh-- no, one other thing. Princeton's playing Harvard next week and I was going to dump that game too, only this time, I'm going to make some real money doing it. And I was thinking, maybe you two could pone a little score for yourselves. You know, bet some serious cash on Princeton. You saw how easy it was for me to pull it off. Why not? Just the three of us will know and I'm sure as hell not going to tell anybody. What do you say? I don't this is an issue that needs to be discussed in words, do you? - Uh-uh. You mean, we can all just nod in agreement and acknowledge each other's greed and criminality. I think he's taping this. You're taping this, aren't you? He's wired. Are you wired? Huh? He's not wired. He's just having a little fun at our expense, right, Alan. How does it feel to grovel, Eddie? Not nice, is it. - Teddy. To be on your knees, hoping you get nailed for some moment of human weakness. Hoping some guy in a position of authority doesn't make you suffer because that's what gets him off, doing you in for your transgressions. Yeah, I agree. You're absolutely right. - About what? - Everything. Anything you say. All right? As long as we just call it a clean slate and act as though we never met as soon as you leave this office, isn't that what we want? Huh? Clean slate. CINDY: Nice shot. Don't tell me you came alone. I was expecting the Italian army. CINDY: Hey, no racial stereotyping, remember? I'm sorry things had to work out the way they did. Had to, huh? That's a very interesting way of putting it. As if we have nothing to do with what happens to us-- all fate. Very interesting, especially in the light of the fact that if I don't give you some satisfactory information in the next few minutes, you're going to go to a phone and call your father or Mario or Russell, or whoever the fuck those guys are, and they're going to bop, bop-- shoot me. But you wouldn't have had anything to do with that. It would have just happened. You're getting way too deep for me, Alan. Pardon me. I keep forgetting that you're just a simple cheerleader with nothing on her mind but the winning and losing of basketball games. You know, none of this would have happened in the first place if you hadn't wanted money from my father. I was naive. I thought he was into real estate and construction. You know what? Don't start the accusations-- I didn't know he had rich daughter that was into fixing games. We'll just get into an argument. See? I'm not accusing him, only you. You are one sick fuck, Alan. Yeah, well, I'll try and do better. In the meantime, you can tell your family and friends that the FBI is backing from the case. You and they won't have to hear from them anymore. - Are you serious? - Yeah. How'd you pull that off? Modern technology. You mean, we'll never-- I mean, they won't-- Let me keep they money and you won't hear any more about it. About anything? Well, anything relating to this case. I'm sorry I couldn't get you a blanket license to fix, embezzle, and kill in other areas of your life. But I'll tell you what, I'll work on it for you. You're a strange guy, Alan. Well, we can't all be normal, if there is such a thing. We weren't really going anywhere. I mean, it's not like you were going to ask me to marry you and have your children, were you? No, I can't say that I was. Then I Think it all worked out for the best. That's not a bad way of looking at it. You really are kind of cute, you know that? Thanks. I'm sure glad you didn't have to have me killed. I would have been much less cute as a corpse. I gotta run. Yeah, give me a year or two, I'm sure I'll get sufficiently sentimental about the memory of our relationship. Take your time. So I guess we can say, you saved me twice. Saved-- never. helped-- maybe. No, you saved my mind and my freedom. You saved my life. No way I could ever balance the books with you. Sounds like a polite way of saying goodbye. No, I didn't mean it like that. I know. I'm teasing. I don't handle compliments too gracefully. Well, at the risk of making you feel even more uncomfortable, I should apologize to you as well. - For what? For having caused an abrupt end to that little erotic triangle you were obviously enjoying so much with America's finest. I think I'll survive. It had just about played itself out anyway. So tell me something. Why did you choose-- Teddy and Kelly in particular, or sex in general? Oh, well, sex in general I think I understand. Although, you are farther out than I guess-- Than who? Than you? You are 22 now. Let's compare notes when you're 28 and we'll see who's where. Yeah, well what-- what about them? I mean, why choose such-- Why two FBI agents? Maybe because they were FBI agents. Yeah, well I don't want to be rude, but-- Oh, come on, be rude. I think I can handle it. What does that make you, some kind of collector? The way I see it, you're on this earth for about a split second. You find out what excites you and as long as you're not forcing it, or hurting anyone, you try it. - What about love? - What about it? Don't you want to fall in love and have children? Sure, if it happens. But you cant make yourself want something? Do you think you and I could ever do that? - Fall in love? - Why not? With each other? Yeah, of course, with each other. I wouldn't rule it out. Yeah, that's the way I feel-- wouldn't rule it out. Wouldn't rule it out. In the meantime, I think I've gone about as far as I can in your general thinking about life and sanity and madness and death. I think what I need to do is get concrete, find something that I can get good at and something that I can make a living doing. Any ideas? Yeah, actually. I thought of it last night, as I was going to sleep. Are you serious? Yeah, well, I'm not saying it's going to be forever, or even for the next year, but I'm going to try it. Good for you. Those pictures last night don't really count. No one's going to put them on exhibit. Do you want be my first subject? It would be my pleasure. Stand over there. Oh, ran out. Well, we'll do more later. I hope so. I want to start looking out more and get away from just looking in, Contemplating. The navel of my own void. I want to look out at the world and see it, and seize it, and maybe even enrich it. I want to look at you, inside and out. I want to see you from every angle and every way. Well, don't sign in blood just yet. You may want to reconsider. Uh-uh. No way. I gotta go teach my class. Tonight at 8:00? Tonight at 8:00. Look at the water, honey. See the water? Isn't it neat? Excuse me? Do you mind? - Brendan? Brendan? Look it. Do you want to have your picture taken? Hey? Can I take your picture? Yeah? Don't be afraid. I'm just going to take your picture. Come a little closer. Go ahead. Go look at his camera. You see his camera. Come here. Now, give me a nice muscle-man pose. There we go. There. yeah. SANDY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Sometimes it never ends. Sometimes it never ends. Never ends. Never ends. LSD 25. Never ends. Is everything OK? SANDY (IN ALAN'S HEAD): Never ends. Never ends. Never ends. Never ends. LSD 25. Everything's OK. I hope you're right. (SINGING) Fading, enter hero. Fucked up with a girl. Star-crossed, fate is cruel too, but I'm still hanging on. To your hair, your face, your eyes, your smile, the way you're free just like a child. Your arms embrace, your lips I taste, the way you want me everyday. No more never after. Nowhere in the world.
