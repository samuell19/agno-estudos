Food is out? Good. The dessert table's done? [laughs] No snacking. Bartenders are set? Thank you. Tell the staff to take their places. The first few minutes are going to be a madhouse. Even all this Christmas cheer won't slow down the hungry masses... [crowd cheering] Then the caterer needs to get more ice. We planned the party, he's in charge of keeping the drinks cold. Great job everyone, really fantastic. [group cheers] Well done, Rachel. [laughs] Another successful event under your belt. Uh, your belt. This is Gail Lane Events. I just execute them for you. Well, my name may be on the door, but we're a team, Rachel. You had the vision for this evening and it was a smashing success. June is pleased. So am I. I am so glad to hear that. And I appreciate your faith in me, Gail. Especially letting me run point on these high-profile ones. Listen, so I have a binder full of plans, and I am ready to hit the ground running on the ambassador's engagement party. Tomorrow morning, if you want. Yeah. About that. Come with me. It seems the ambassador and his future wife are having issues, they've decided to call it off. The party, not the engagement. Yet. Now you can relax and enjoy the rest of the holiday. All our other parties are covered. [sighs] Oh, Rachel. Please don't be disappointed. You're going to be running this company someday, you know. Really? Really. You're the best on my staff. You've earned this break, so take some time, recharge your batteries, we've got a busy year. Come January, you'll have many more chances for you to shine like you did tonight. Thank you, Gail. Now, I'm gonna make sure the caterers have enough ice. Oh, fabulous. You're awake? Adelaide said you'd been asleep for an hour. I was faking. I wanted to wait up for you. Honey, it's so late. I know. But I like to see you when you get home from work. Can we do an Adventures of Ava? A quick one. Okay then. Let's do a quick one. [giggles] Okay. All right. Now, where does Ava want to go today? Hmm. A candy land. Oh. I think I'm going to like this one. ...It was time for another adventure, and Ava was hungry for peppermint, her very favourite. So, she closed her eyes and she said the secret password. Adventure time. She found herself on a magical candy cane lane. ♪ I mean, she didn't say when, but she did say that I'd be running the company someday. Yeah, I have no doubt. I mean, word is getting out about you, Rache. What are you talking about? This is actually a work dinner. I'm here to convince you and Ava to come back to Tennessee for Christmas. So, my mother sent you. No, Dolly did. Right. Yeah, sure. Because Dolly Parton absolutely knows that I exist. [sarcastically] This must be her now. She calls me every day. I'm being serious. What are you talking about? This year is the 30th anniversary of Smoky Mountain Christmas at Dollywood. We throw a big event on the 23rd, and the planner fell out. And you want Gail Lane? I'm so sorry, Max. She is so busy this time of year, she cannot take anything else on. She can't take anything else on, but you have suddenly found yourself available. It would still be under the Gail Lane umbrella, but I talked to the board about you. They want to meet with you ASAP, and even better, when is the last time you had a real hometown Christmas? Hmm, a while, actually. And Ava never has. My parents always come out here, because the holidays are party season, and Ava loves Christmas in the city, so... Well, she's going to love it in Pigeon Forge even more. I mean, what is more special than Christmas in the Smokies? In the house that you grew up in? With your family? In the amusement park where we raised havoc as kids? And think of how good this is going to make you look in Gail's eyes. A big brand as a new client? Would I get to meet Dolly? What do you think? [laughs] Okay, I'll take the meeting. I mean, you know what? You're right. Gail would be thrilled. See, it's a win-win for everyone. Thank you. Christmas in Tennessee. That does sound nice. Cheers! Cheers. ♪ So Luke, do you think we should dress the sign or leave it as is? I think we leave it as is. Okay. Well, we are having issues with the LED Christmas tree on Glacier Ridge. No glitches, Eric. I need it working on cue every night. It's the 30th anniversary. Yeah. And with me taking over the celebration now, I need them to see that I can handle more than just park operations. I don't know why they don't just make you general manager right now. Why are you even interviewing? I mean, you've been working here since what, 1912? 1996. But close. And I guess they need to do their due diligence. Vet all the candidates and make sure they're getting the right man for the job. I intend to convince them that that's me. [airplane engine roars] Thank you. Wow, this is amazing. [laughs] Even better than New York, right? Mm-hmm. Dad? Hey! [laughs] It's been a little while since I used these, clearly. Ginger, they're here! [laughs] Oh, finally. Oh, we've been waiting all day for you two. I know we were delayed. Oh! Okay, this is 10 times more decorations than you used to do. You think I'm going to mess around when I finally get my granddaughter here at Christmas? We are going to show Ava all of our old traditions. Yep, starting tonight. Letters to Santa. Ava, you can never write too many letters to Santa. Open house this Friday night. Dad's doing open house again? All traditions. Mom made sweet potato pie to welcome you home, and for good luck for your meeting tomorrow. And you, first thing in the morning, we're picking out a tree. Best. Christmas. Yet. [laughs] Let's get inside. Plenty of time to enjoy these decorations, 'cause you're finally here for Christmas! So good to have you home. Dad. ♪ You know, there are better photo opportunities in the park. I could get you a map. [laughs] Oh, I'm... I'm not a park guest. Although, I might have to hit the Tennessee Tornado. [chuckles] No, I'm... I'm... I'm surveying. Researching. Just... You're a spy! Taking top secret ideas to the competitors, are we? My cover is blown! Look at me, out in the open. What was I thinking? I am really terrible at subterfuge, aren't I? I have seen better. The... the anniversary party, I assume that some of it will happen in here? It's the VIP area. Whoever was planning this party should know that this layout is all wrong in this context. When a party is inside and outside, you want tall tables to keep the flow going so guests don't miss anything. Is that right? Yeah, and these... these centrepieces, I mean, they're pretty. But they need more attention to detail. Maybe they're working on them. You still haven't said... [phone beeps] Oh, I gotta go. I'm so sorry. It was lovely talking with you, have a great day. Yeah, you too. ...Have a great day. Eric! Change of plans. So you wait here, and they'll come and get you when they're ready. And then I want you to come straight to my office after. [sighs] You got this. Thanks, Mags. Bye. It's a great picture of her, isn't it? If it isn't 007. Hello again. Hi. She's incredible, isn't she? Yeah. I've admired her since I was a kid. I used to come to the park in high school hoping to run into her. As if Dolly Parton were just wandering around the park, riding roller coasters. Actually, she does walk the park from time to time. You're here for the interview. I am. Well, that explains the surveying. I'm up for the job, too. So, where do you come from? A good spy never reveals her secrets. I wasn't going to tell you anything either. But a word of advice though, the board in there, they don't really do small talk. I learned that the hard way. Passion is great, but business is business. You sure say a lot for someone who wasn't going to say anything. [laughs] See? I should take my own advice. How do I know you're not telling me the exact opposite of what I should do in there? I guess you're just going to have to trust your instincts. I actually have very good instincts. You do know a lot about tall tables for a spy, that's for sure. Luke? They're ready for you. You can come on back. Good luck in there. Right back atcha. Rachel? We're ready for you, too. Didn't you just bring that other guy back? Oh, yes. But he's going in for a different position. Park GM. You're sitting down with the head of hospitality first, and then meeting with the board. Ah. Ready? Yeah. And if you'll look at my next slide, you'll see my attendance projections. Eighteen percent increase with this accelerated marketing plan for this next fiscal year. Any questions? So, well that's... that's my presentation. Um, I've made copies for all of you to review. On your own time. It's optional. Enlightening, and thorough. Now, Carl. About the anniversary party? I'd like to take it over. Because that's what a general manager does. Covers where there's a need. And we know that I'm more than up to this task. You've given us a lot to think about today, Luke. Thank you. Okay. I'm glad it went well with Audrey. It did. So, if you're ready, we can take you in to meet the board. Great. Yeah. Your turn. Teed them up for you. I guess it's on me to hit it home. We need to stop thinking of this as a party and start looking at it as an event. Large, exciting, epic. And your brand is the key. We embrace the elements that keep your guests coming back. The music, the warmth, the community. At Gail Lane events, that's where we excel. And we'd like to help you ring in the next 30 years with a bang. Interesting. Thank you, Rachel. We'll be in touch. [quietly] Thank you. Like this? Looks like I got here just in time. How'd the interview go? I don't know. They were very hard to read. Yeah, it was, uh, it was like looking around at a bunch of poker faces, and I had a two and a ten in my hand. [clicks tongue] I'm sure you did fine. So, we're making a bunch of homemade ornaments, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. When I was little, every year, we would each make a new ornament for the tree. They even brought Daddy into the tradition the first year I brought him home for Christmas. I think Daddy would've liked this one. Candy canes were his favourite, right? Yes, sweetie. And I think so, too. [phone rings] Rachel Davis. Okay. Yes, 9:00AM. I'll see you then. Thank you. Hey. How about that? They want me to come back tomorrow to meet with the board again. Yay! Second interview. Yeah, sounds like it. All right, let's do this. Gotta make some decorations for the tree. Have you seen this place? It is so boring. [laughs] No, it's not. Where's the Christmas? Hey. Dad's gone all out for this open house, huh? [laughs] It's been a lot of years. I think he missed it almost as much as he misses having you here. So, what did Gail say? Well, she's thrilled. I may have brought in a big new client. Well, this is ammunition for you taking over the company one day. Since she's grooming you for that. I know. It's exciting. [sighs] Do you still enjoy it? Of course. I love it. It's just that it's a very demanding job, and I want to make sure I still have time for Ava. Honey. I know you love it. Maybe you should start thinking about something that's a little more 9:00-5:00, with a lighter schedule. You'd have more time for Ava, and the things you love. Maybe you could start writing again. Mom. This is what I do. Okay. This is what I excel at. This is how I show my daughter that no matter what life throws at you, you can make your own way. Oh, she knows that, honey. She may have been little, but she watched you pick yourself up after losing Greg. That was so important for her to see. I just want you to be happy. Working yourself to the bone for Gail is just... Mom, it's not that dramatic. Okay. I'm happy. I'm going to go make sure Ava's ready for bed. [crowds chattering] Back again? You must've impressed them in there. Oh, I did. Yes. No question. How can you be so sure? I only saw poker faces in there. Well, it was either when they stood up and clapped or when they said I checked all the boxes. Wait, they actually said that? Multiple times. And they clapped? They don't clap. But you believed me. Hey, maybe I am good at subterfuge. Listen, the job, you know it's not... Rachel, Luke, they're ready for you. You can come on back.. (Both) Together? Rachel, I'm sure you've already bumped into Luke Hakman, Director of Park Operations. We think that Rachel's passion and party planning experience coupled with your familiarity with our brand make the perfect team to spearhead the anniversary party, since we're only six days out, Carl, it's already well underway. It's going great. It's the 30th, Luke. And we're talking about taking something great and really elevating it, which is what Rachel excels at. While you're good at executing a plan. I'm actually also very good at executing a plan. Wonderful. Then you two sound like a real win-win. Win-win. Win-win. Welcome to Dollywood. Where the only thing bigger than our Christmas spirit is our hair. Well, your hair has tamed considerably since high school. Yours, too. [laughs] This is you. So, the only question is, when do I get to meet Dolly? Oh, she's always so busy performing and travelling, we never know when she's coming in or out. But I promise you the second I hear she's around, you will be the first to know. [laughs] Thanks, Mags, for everything. It's my pleasure, I'm just so glad you're home. For the holidays. Sure. Whatever you say. Good morning. Good morning. You knew we weren't up for the same job. Why didn't you tell me? I got the feeling you were trying to psych me out. I was trying to help you. Were you? Looks like it worked. If I actually took your advice. Did you? I'll never tell. [laughs] So. What do you say we get started? C'mon. We've got a lot to do. And the VIP tent, which you've already seen. Hmm. Tall tables. The old centrepieces are gone too... interesting. It was an executive decision. It had very little to do with you. Well, it was the right executive decision. All right, I think we should set the schedule and create an action plan. An action plan. So nothing gets missed. I happen to be very thorough. Oh, I'm sure you are. We need to go over what's been done so far, what holes need to be filled. Carl has asked for ideas and we need to step it up. It's been 30 years. Look, it's gonna be fine. Luke, I want it to be more than fine. I want it to be the best! So do I. - Good. - Good. - Okay. - Yeah. All right then. It's settled. Great. Okay, two things we haven't discussed yet. Food and staffing. Hospitality's taking care of the food. We're good there. I have an idea. Luke, when you plan a party, every detail is a reflection of you. And I'm here representing Gail Lane Events, so I won't settle for anything less than perfect. This chef is very good, we don't need to micromanage him. Good. I have an idea. Why do you keep saying that? Because I have a lot of... ideas? Look, we need to have them create a holiday menu, and we'll do a tasting. I like to know exactly what we're getting, and I never do anything on faith. You're a bit bossy, aren't you? Well, one person's bossy is another person's detail-oriented. You know, I've worked at this park since I was 15, and I know it like the back of my hand. And I have 43 major functions under my belt. I know parties like the back of my hand. Oh. Here I thought it was an event. Yes. It is an event. See? We're making progress. Hmm? Luke, one more week, and I'm out of your hair for good. And maybe by the end of this thing, you'll come out of it with what you want. Nothing, man. Not even a word about the job. Well, maybe planning this party is your job interview continued. Longest interview ever. Should we call Guinness? [laughs] First guy in my family to go to college, and now I'm going to be the first guy in my family to climb to the top of the executive food chain. And I can do this on my own. I don't need some fancy New York City party planner. What about Wild West Amusements? Aren't they trying to poach you away from us? There are other parks out there, Luke. Not for me, Eric. Not for me. Dollywood's my home. All right. There's a giant tree back there. That wasn't here when I was a kid. That was Glacier Ridge. Opened a year ago. Every night we light that LED tree. Oh, I bet it's gorgeous. Certainly is. You know, I... I can't help but think. We've got this whole park at our disposal, and we're having the event on Show Street. I mean it's beautiful, but... Yeah, it's the centrepiece of the park. It's where we always have the parties. Yeah but I... I feel like we're missing something. Some way to use this whole park and not just Show Street. Hold on. Are you saying that you don't have an idea right now? Are you... are you feeling okay? Do you need to sit down? I'm fine, thank you. It'll come to me. It always does. What do you do when you get stuck? Well, I don't get stuck. No, I just keep going until I figure it out. Uh-huh. Well, I'd like to do something to get out of my head, till it hits me. I know just the place to go, and they'll still be there. Come on. "And he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, "and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. "But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight, "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night." [applause] Did you like that? Is that one of your favourite stories? I know, it's one of mine, too. Imagine that. Being the kind of person who would start a foundation that donates books to little kids all over the world. And over 100 million and counting. That's Dolly. Books are transformative. I still don't know what we're doing here. Right, well, when I get stuck, a bookstore is a great place to come. You know, when you get lost in the story, become a kid, that's... that's when inspiration strikes. Well, let's say you stay here, search for your inspiration, while I go back to the park, because I still have operations to run. Mommy! Hey! Did you hear Grammy's story? Yes, it's one of my favourites. Luke, this is my daughter, Ava. Hi, Ava. It's very nice to meet you. You too. Well, I'll see you back at work. Yeah. Bye. 'Kay. Mommy, who was that? That was my coworker. [phone ringing] Luke Hakman. Hey Luke, it's Mark Haber calling from Wild West Amusements. Sorry to call you after hours, but it's been a busy day, then had a dinner. It's okay. I'm just leaving work now myself as well. You see, that's exactly why I want you at my park. Dedication. Look, I just had dinner tonight with my final candidate, and he's not it. I know you've already turned me down, but I am not a man who gives up easily. I need you here, Luke. I really appreciate the vote of confidence, Mark. But... You know, I could sweeten the pot. It's not about the money for me. I love it here. This place is my home. Well listen, if it doesn't go your way, the great state of Georgia could be your home in no time. I'll remember that. Have a good night. ♪ You really outdid yourself, Dad. All right, Ava. Hand me that string of lights. Ava went inside a couple minutes ago. Ah. Sorry. I think she prefers helping Mom bake. [laughs] You don't have enough dough out here for her to sample, so. It's a fair choice. Yeah. But seriously, Dad. Like, the decorations you already had put up aren't enough? Well, people are talking about the revival of my open house. They come from miles around. I need to make it worth their while. It already is! Look at this display. Oh, and I'll make sure to come home early tonight so I can be here in plenty of time to help pass out cocoa. That was always my job as a kid, and this year Ava and I will do it together. As it should be. [laughs] We'll see you tonight. Bye. [chattering] Luke. Tomorrow at noon, food tasting. The chef has created a unique Christmas menu, not just boring old Swedish meatballs or something. You said that because you knew I was having them pass Swedish meatballs, didn't you? Uh, lucky guess. Look, I meant no offence by that of course. But the chef is getting really creative. Fine, we go creative but accessible. Don't do anything people can't pronounce. Fine. Also, what will servers be wearing? Tuxedos, like at most catered affairs. I have an idea. Is that your favourite saying? Because you sure use it a lot. I'm thinking of something more festive. This is Smoky Mountain Christmas, so let's portray that everywhere you look. I'll make an appointment with the costume department. Anything else? Yes. Tonight, I know we're meeting about the schedule, but I'm doing a thing with my family, so can we meet at my parents' place? Do I have a choice? What if I said "pretty please and we'll feed ya?" I'd say "text me the address." ♪ Let's hear it for Santa Claus... ♪ She's just so... there. All the time. Telling me what to do. Like there's nothing wrong with having ideas. Like, she knows what it takes to keep this amusement park up to par. She's been here for five days. Five days with him, and it feels like a month. Rachel, you know how to play nice with others. I'm trying, but it's my reputation on the line. You know, if I don't come through with my first big solo event, Gail will never trust me to run her company. She could literally blow my opportunity if they don't like her "outside the box" ideas. But if they do, let her make you look good. Ride those coattails. Hm? You two need to stop fighting. You both want the same thing! Plus, you catch more flies with honey, honey. Hey, girls. Luke, hi. Um, I... I... I was just telling Maggie how great it's going. Yeah, yeah, same. Great. Enjoy your lunch. Okay, see ya. Yah... Bye. Good chat. ♪ Repeat the sounding joy ♪ ♪ Repeat the sounding joy ♪ Repeat, repeat the sounding joy ♪ [giggles] You're welcome. Ava! It's time. Mommy, I think Grandma needs my help with baking some more cookies. Okay, go ahead. - Hi. - Hi. I thought we were meeting. We are. Here. You're on marshmallow duty. [laughs] Maybe we should have a station like this at the party, huh? That's a good idea. Wait. Somebody else can have a good idea? Are you feeling okay? Because I wasn't sure if that was allowed, It's allowed and welcome. You need to sit down, take a minute, let that sink in? [laughs] Wow. You people sure don't mess around. What, you don't decorate like this for Christmas? I have a wreath. A wreath? Yeah. One is all I have time for. Hammer, nail, wreath. Boom. Christmas. [laughs] Look Luke, I'm not used to having to defer to anyone. I mean, I have a boss in New York, but she gives me a lot of rope. What I'm trying to say is, I'm sorry. If I came across as overbearing, it wasn't my intention. I'm sorry, too. I mean, ultimately, we... we both want the same thing. Yes, we do. And I don't like failing. Me neither. So let's say we call a truce, and create the best event this park has ever seen. Deal? Deal. [laughs] Great, just get back to me... Good morning. Hi. I was just in the VIP tent. I love what you are doing. It's really starting to take shape, Rache. Thanks. You're making me look good. Well, that was my master plan all along. - She's here! - Let's go, let's go... What's with them? Oh, Dolly's here. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to tell you. Everybody gets a little excited when she comes in. Luke is down with her on Market Street right now, but they should probably be back up here soon. Great. Good, that's good. Maggie, do you have a moment? Oh, yeah. Excuse me. - She's here! - Let's go, let's go! Rachel. Hi. Hello. I... I thought you were with Dolly. I was. She just left, she's heading to her helicopter. She has a show tonight. Yeah, great. Good. Uh, I brought the RSVP list for the VIP tent. I thought you'd want to see it. I gave it to you. Right. Yes. Uh, don't forget. Noon, today, food tasting. Bring your appetite. [laughs weakly] [laughs] All righty. Cranberry cheese bites. These will be passed along with bite sized pulled pork biscuits, fried tomato goodie baskets, and pecan pie lollies. I'm also going to do Christmas tree shaped towers of fruit and vegetables. This all looks so delicious. Thank you for thinking outside the box. Well, it was fun putting the menu together. And it should be unique. 30 years. However, I will honour tradition with a funnel cake station. After all, we're famous for them. I'm sure it'll be a huge hit. I've got a few more dishes for you to sample. Eat. I'll be right back. Thank you. Mmm. This is so good. Oh, so I have an idea. Here we go. We have all the shows in the park going on during the party, right? But our guests have to leave the festivities in order to see them. Well yeah, because shows tend to happen in the theatres. But what if we took the shows out of the theatres and onto Show Street? To do a little number there? Like a variety show. We bring the entertainment to them. Yeah, that could work. I'll call the head of entertainment and get him on it right away. Not a party. (Both) A production. And we'll have to get Dolly to introduce the show. That's the key. I love it.

Hey. This is what you do on your day off? I never take a day off. Too much to do. This is what you do on your day off. Of course. We've been having a blast. [giggles] Plus, a little research. A little surveying. Mm-hmm. But Ava's been my sidekick today, huh? Hi, Ava. You having fun? We've been on every ride. We've seen every show, every musical act. And we're trying to figure out how to tie the performances together in a fun, cohesive way. Hmm. Well, if you're looking to figure things out, I might know just the place. Sometimes I go there when I need to step away. I thought you didn't get stuck. Sometimes you just need an outlet. Someplace to gather your thoughts. Wait a minute. This is where you come to gather your thoughts? What can I say? I don't like the quiet. [laughs] I can't believe they still do this in the square. I used to come here with my dad when I was a kid. We were very serious about naming our snowmen. Ava and I still do it. What should we name this one? Meg, Joe, Amy? Beth. Little Women. I'm following the pattern. You know what I think she needs? Arms. Of course she does. I'm going to get some sticks over there. So, you really like books. Yeah. I always had my nose in one as a kid. They're the best escape. I majored in literature. I even... Well, I used to think I might even write children's books for a living. Well, what happened? You know, you give something a try for a few years and nobody bites, and you figure it's time to cut your losses. I'm good at what I do, you know and I'm on a great track with Gail. I can think of a worse plan B. Now those are some top-notch choices, Ava. Thank you. You're welcome. Perfect. Its tiny nose. [laughs] You know what else long arms are good for? Throwing snowballs. No! No, no, no. Woah. What about you? What about me? Well, why do you want this promotion so badly? Director of Operations is no small accomplishment. Growing up, times were tough. Even though both of my parents, they worked so hard. And I was determined to be the one that ended that cycle for my family. From my first day at the park, I knew I wanted to get all the way to the top, because it means your sacrifice, all your hard work, it wasn't for nothing. Now I know why you're such a workaholic. You're one to talk. [laughs] Yeah. I know, I'm always trying to figure out how to juggle it all, but it's... it's tricky. You don't make it look tricky. ...Um, that way. Yeah. We're... we're that way. Do you want to come over for a bite to eat? I really should... What? Get back to work? No. I actually need to go check out a DJ. This party isn't the only thing I have on my plate, you know. Well, go tomorrow. Because my family and I are doing something very interesting and I think you should join us, Mr. One Wreath At Christmas. I'm simultaneously intrigued and terrified. Good. I've never even baked a cupcake, let alone a yule log, which I've also never heard of. It's only the greatest holiday dessert of all time. That doesn't help me very much. I haven't done much of this at Christmas. The park is always so busy during the holidays. Well, what about your family? I spend Christmas Day with them. I'm sorry, but that is an unacceptable amount of holiday cheer. Again. She's right, Luke. That just will not do. So you're going to stay here and bake your first yule log with us. I'm willing to give it a shot, but this? This doesn't look quite right. What? It's messy. You have to spread the frosting evenly, like this. Wow. Maybe you should do it, since you're so good at it. I know what you're trying to do, Luke. Now frost. Yours is amazing. Thanks, yours too. And Mom's! Mm-hmm. Oh, Luke. It's, it's beautiful. Is it though? Not really. But that's okay, because it'll taste good. I think. Great. You know, I had yule log for breakfast, and I brought some for lunch too. [laughs] You are hooked. It only takes one. So good. Try this on. Are you kidding? Well, I need to see it on if we want our staff to wear this. Oh. Really? Well then, I need to see this on to see if our staff will wear this. Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Fine. [Jazzy version of the 'Twelve Days of Christmas plays] ♪ You look amazing. You do. Thank you. It's my colour. No. Hmm, not exactly the classy image we're going for. I was told I'd find you two here, in the North Pole. We were just, uh... For the staff. To wear at the party. We're figuring things out. Interesting. So, we love that we're now doing performances on Show Street. PR's already on it, and Country Cable, you know that channel? Well, they want to feature highlights on their news program, since Dolly is introducing the show. Now, it's going to be more than just our party guests watching, so let's make sure everything is extra special. And I'd nix the outfits. Already nixed. Yeah, long nixed. Well, you wanted a production. Not exactly what I meant. I've never done anything this big on such short notice. I guess it's make or break. Do or die. Sink or swim. [laughs weakly] You're still here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, my parents took Ava to the movies, so I figured I'd stay late and watch videos of some old specials. I feel like we need a big finale, you know? But so far I'm coming up short. Sounds like you're spinning a little. Thinking too much, maybe? Maybe a little. Or a lot. Mm-hmm. I just, I've had press before, but never national cable coverage. Well, if you're in the mood for a different environment, I'm heading down to the Saddle Inn to hear that DJ play that I was telling you about. Maybe you might want to get out of your head for a bit? I... I haven't been line dancing in years. That's... that's not what I meant. I'm just going down to listen. I don't dance. Well, you do now. You've got cowboy boots, dontcha? [nervously] Yeah.

Look, line dancing has always been much more of a spectator sport for me. Then it's time to stop riding the bench and get into the game. And here I thought you were only bossy at work.

[laughs] It's kind of low on the priority list. [Instrumental version of "The First Noel"] ♪ Or maybe I just haven't had the right partner. Um, we're here to listen to the DJ, and the dance floor's a pretty good place for that. [laughs] You have done what many have tried and failed. What's that? Getting me dancing. Well, getting me out, really. You must have some magical powers or something. [laughs] Or maybe it's just your sheer force of will. [laughs] Maybe you're just embracing what the world has to offer outside of work for once. Seeing you with Ava yesterday, you're one of the good ones, Luke. Well, she's a really great kid. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You're a really good mom. Always doing your best to be a perfect role model for her. But... What? I just feel like maybe she's watching you live your plan B. I know you tried before with your writing, but maybe it wasn't the right time. There's no "maybe" about it. It didn't happen, and it wasn't for lack of trying. Hmm. What if now is your time? What's that saying? "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." And the thing about writing is you don't need an invitation to do it. It can always be a hobby until it isn't anymore. Wow. Get him on the dance floor one time and suddenly he's an armchair life coach. [laughs] Oh! ♪ I forgot how good it smells here. And Ava loves it. I think even more than New York. And what about you? I mean, Tennessee, it gets in your blood. Tennessee has always been in my blood. I never felt like a true New Yorker. But back when I was married, my husband got a job there, so we moved and then life took over. But this? This has always felt like home. I know. I think it's why I keep passing on this job in Atlanta. What job is that? Running Wild West Amusements. I don't know. Maybe I should take the sure thing. It's a good offer. No. You've done the preparation, Luke. And you're going to be the GM of Dollywood. I can feel it. Yeah? Yeah. I'm telling you, it wasn't. I don't know, I think it might have been... Oh! Ah! There you are. How was the movie? Great. Ava's waiting up for her story. We thought we'd do it in front of the fire tonight. Unless you two are... busy. Working. I'm never too busy for that. You uh, you up for a story? That depends. Will there be yule log? [laughs] I think we can round some up. Then count me in. And as Ava sat in a sleigh, they went up, up, up, and away! Sailing across the milky way, over the seas, delivering presents to all the little kids all around the world. But Ava said, "Santa, how can you find "all those houses of all those little kids?" And he said "Ho, ho, ho. "Little girl, there's a path to every destination. "You just have to follow it." Mommy, keep going. The path. To Glacier Ridge. I know what to do for the finale. Yeah.

Is this where you keep all the Christmas decorations? Oh, no. We keep those on site. These are books for Dolly's Imagination Library. What? Mm-hmm. Yeah, one of the local affiliates is moving over the holidays, so we said they could store 'em here until New Year's. All those little kids, getting all those books. Maybe someday you could have a book in her library. [laughs] You'd kind of have to be published first. Are you writing again, Rache? Well, I mean, no. No, it's nothing. Because if you are, I have some connections. I could put you in touch with somebody. That is not necessary. Anyway, we gotta go. It's almost time for the presentation. Come on. Oh, hey. What? Hi. [laughs] So the stage show wraps up. And everyone thinks all right, that's it. Show's over, let's call it a night. Until the parade music starts, loud and powerful, through the whole park. And down Show Street comes The Parade of Many Colours. So Dolly gets in her car, she drives up with a parade in tow. The music continues, and then all of our shows' cast join in and head up the park. They'll encourage guests to follow along... ...Up to Glacier Ridge, where we'll do the finale, the tree lighting, and we'll unveil the LED star at the top. Yeah, Luke, uh, the tree's being glitchy. What do you mean, glitchy? Glitchy in that it doesn't always want to work. I thought you reprogrammed it. I did. I'm still working on it. We have to have faith, because, because it beats panic and we only have two days. [laughs] Also Eric, fix it. Please. Yes, because PR just told me that we got RSVPs for over 40 press outlets now that Dolly is presenting. Yeah, it's gotten a little bigger than we'd originally planned for, so it needs to go off without a hitch. Now in your folders, you'll see your marching orders. And in the meantime, let's clear the path from show street up to Glacier Ridge. We've never run the parade up through there. You see, now this is a finale. Yes, it is. If it works. It was my very first day here, and all new hires had to attend an orientation. Well, don't forget the most important part. You were 15. You never let anyone forget that. You've been here a long time. I've had other jobs, but always found my way back here. They've been good to me. Lately, haven't had a reason to leave. If I worked here, I would never leave. So Dolly happened to be at my orientation. She likes to welcome new employees whenever she can. And we each had to go to the front of the room and tell a little about ourselves. I was so nervous when I walked to the front, I tripped over my own feet. I knocked into her, taking her down to the ground with me. [laughs] Oh, my gosh. I was so humiliated, but she was completely gracious about it. All she said was "watch the hair, son." [laughs] She never forgot me after that. Well, at least you got to meet her. Well, she'll definitely be at the party, and I hope for your sake your first encounter with her is not as memorable as mine was. [phone rings] Hi, Gail. I heard from Carl Hensley you were doing an incredible job. I just wanted to hear how it's going straight from the horse's mouth. It's a whirlwind, but not the first time I've been through one of those. I always know that when you're on the job, you give it your attention 24/7. I never have to worry or micromanage with you. Well, everyone seems very happy. And all this press we're getting is going to help us in a huge way. Oh, I know. I've gotten a lot of calls already. Incidentally, several of them asking about you specifically. About me? And I know you want more. I'm talking about a partnership, you and me. I'm not ready to hang up my hat altogether just yet, but I don't ever want to lose you, Rachel. When I said that you're the best on my team, I meant it. That's quite an offer. Look, finish up the event. Take some much deserved time with your family. You're going to need the rest, because we hit the ground running the first of the year. Together. We'll talk about details later. Goodnight, Rachel. Goodnight, Gail. Hey. You're up late. Yeah. I guess with the party in a few days, work doesn't stop just because we're tired, right? Actually, I'm not working. Adventures of Ava. Yeah, I'm just writing down some of our greatest hits. For fun. Just for fun? Yeah. Rache. You can always try again, you know. I know. And I might, someday. You look so happy lately. I am happy. You know, experiencing all the old traditions together, and seeing how happy Ava is, and... And Luke? [sighs] I see how you two look at each other. Most of the time, I think I look at him with annoyance. [laughs] And vice-versa. Mom. He lives here, and my life is in New York. In fact tonight, Gail made me a very interesting offer. A partnership. Oh, that's wonderful. [laughs] Yeah. Are you sure your life is still in New York? Yes, Mom. My home is there. Ava's school is there, my job is there. But all those things you just listed, they're here in Tennessee too. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight, Mom. How are we on crowd control around Glacier Ridge? We have the area roped off for the parade. It's not going to be a problem. Perfect. We have a lot of work to do before the final run through tonight. Yeah. Mark. Hi. Hey. What are you doing in town? Oh hey, I came to the party. I've been a season pass holder since I was a kid. So, everybody in town is talking about you, Luke. Is that right? Oh yeah, this is supposed to be quite the event that you're throwing. So, how are things? Well, there's been no word on the promotion yet, but I think they're getting close, though. Close. Luke, come on. I mean, I know you've been here a long time, and I admire the loyalty. But I'm offering you a sure thing. I know, but... Everything after the word "but" is irrelevant. I'll tell you what, I'm going to email you an offer and I think you're going to like what you see. Let's talk in a couple of days. That guy's pretty slick. Yeah. What do I do? You let the powers at be at Dollywood see the event you're about to put on. The rest is just paperwork? Thanks, Eric. Good morning, Alexis. Morning. I'm Vince Blackwell, I'm here to meet for the GM position. Alexis. We spoke on the phone. Of course. Yes. I love your office, it's beautiful. Thank you. Can I get you coffee, tea? But remember, as soon as 'Twas the Night Before Christmas' comes off the stage, we need Appalachian Christmas ready. Eric got the tree working. Software glitch solved. That is perfect, because we are about ready for a dress rehearsal. We are taking the parade up to Glacier Ridge. All right, I am going to go get set up. I'll head down there with him. Give us a call when you're ready and you're on your way. Will do. Okay guys, let's head on down for a dress rehearsal. Dolly is here and she'd like to see the tree now that it's working. Copy. Dolly would like to see the tree. And so she shall see the tree. All right, give us 10 minutes to get set up, we'll meet her over at Glacier Ridge. ♪ All right, Eric. Let's get the lights and the star back on. Dolly's on her way over now. Sure thing, boss. [whimsical Christmas music] ♪ Looking good, my friend. Looking very good. Uh... What just happened? Uh, I don't know. The glitch is back, um... We blew a circuit. Don't worry, I'll figure it out. Well, can you figure it out fast Dolly is... ...here! [clears throat] Hey, sorry guys. Dolly had to take a call with her manager, so she won't be able to come by. Everything okay? Yes, yes, totally. That's fine. We're just having a little issue. Yeah, yeah, it's... no problem. Just um, tell her everything will be perfect and ready for tomorrow. Right, Eric? Yeah. Okay, well, just call me if you need anything, okay? Yep. Great job. So, this might be a problem. Big time. [chuckles] Here are some more of your keepsakes. Thank you. I'll take a look and see what I want to keep. Oh, there's more. I'll put them all in the den. Hey honey. Look who stopped by. Luke, hey. What are you doing here? Did Eric get the tree back online? Because I didn't hear anything. Grab your coats and your gloves. We're going out. You, me and Ava. I'm going to take that as a no. Oh, it's a definitive no. But I can't sit around waiting for a call, so we're going somewhere. And you're not going to tell me where? [whispers] It's a secret. A minty fresh, delicious secret. Are we doing Peppermint Lane? Everything's peppermint. Yeah. You go from store to restaurant to bakery, and everyone has a peppermint treat to share. I haven't done this since I was a kid. I was going to surprise you and bring you this weekend after the party, but somebody beat me to it. Ava did mention that peppermint was her favourite. It's my very favourite. [laughs] Well, it's our next stop. This is amazing. I know, right? What do you want? One of those. Peppermint cupcake. Nice choice, young lady. Oh, my goodness, look who's here. Can I go see Santa? Of course, sweetie. [laughs] Should we get a hot chocolate? Sure, yeah. You know for a minute, I actually forgot that our event might completely fall apart tomorrow night. But that might be the sugar. It's definitely the sugar, and I think I need more because I did not forget. Ah. Thank you. Thanks. But we can only do what we can do. Eric and his team are on it. That does not sound like the Luke I've come to know. You sound very... zen. [laughs] No one has ever said that about me. I believe that. And I'm willing to bet that you've never received that particular compliment, either. Fair. Although you do seem a bit more relaxed than when I first met you. Well, this is home, family, the traditions. It's calming. I've even started writing again. Yeah, just for fun, as a hobby. That's a good start. You know, I've been so focused on trying to beat the family odds that I've completely ignored other areas of my life. And then in walked Rachel Davis, and suddenly I'm accused of being zen. [laughs] Your enthusiasm is contagious, and it's been really nice having you as a partner. I mean, at work. Right. I'm going to miss everybody and this place. Yeah. Hey, sweetie. Okay, Santa just told me that the hardware store on the corner has peppermint bark. No way. Yes way. Okay, then let's go get some. I'll race you there. ♪ All right, so we're back online. Fuses are all fixed, software's glitch free, tree and star are working. But will they work when we need them to? Yeah, I think they will. I need you to know. Yeah, I know. Okay. No mistakes, no speed bumps. We have major press outlets, plus cable coverage and Dolly. It's going to be great. I just wish we had that last run through. But I had a good night last night. You did Peppermint Lane, didn't you? Yeah. With Rachel and her daughter. What? Instead of spinning and worrying and agonizing over something you have absolutely no control over? Something like that. I don't even know who you are right now. You like her. What? No. She lives in New York, she's going to be leaving soon. Maybe something could convince her to stay? This job is done after the party. She's not going to be staying. I wasn't talking about the job, I was talking about your ridiculously charming personality. [laughs] Right. I don't know, I just haven't really heard you agonize over this promotion in a bit. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it just doesn't seem to be the end-all-be-all to you anymore. You know that Dolly quote, "Don't get so busy making a living you forget to make a life?" Yeah. It's kind of been ringing through my head lately. Yeah, I was right. You like her. I think you should tell her before she leaves. Alexis. Oh. You look great. Thank you. Rachel went home to change, I'm going to get ready here, would you please let everyone know I'll be down in a few? Sure. See you there. Okay. Thanks. Alexis, you remember Vince Blackwell? Yes. I invited him to come tonight and see what's going on. Great. I've got big plans for this guy here, he's going to be quite the asset to the park. I have no doubt. ♪ Big night. Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe our time here is almost done. One more week and it's back to New York. You sure are going to be missed around here. It's been so good having you two home. I don't want it to end. I know, but what would I do here if we stayed? The same thing you do in New York. Plan parties for busy people. The difference is, here you'd have us to help you with Ava. Going out on my own though, do you have any idea how time consuming it would be to be a one-woman show? It's as time consuming as you want it to be. You wouldn't have the same volume as the company in New York. You could keep writing. Yeah, but you know, as Gail's partner, I... I could be flexible. We have a whole staff, I could pick and choose my time. Well, if that's what you really want. Yeah. Unless there's something else that might make you want to stay. Better get dressed. All right, so when we see everyone coming up Show Street, we should... ...say something. Wow. You uh, cleaned up pretty nice yourself. So. We're all set. And the gates open for the party guests in half an hour. Good. Everything seems to be up and running again. Digitally. You okay? Nerves getting the best of you? Not nerves. [clears throat] I didn't get the job. What? Why? They haven't even seen what we've done. I guess they didn't need to. They gave it to someone else. I'm so sorry, Luke. It's okay. I've been thinking a lot lately about what's really important, especially since you got here. And I... Me too. Maybe we don't always get to do exactly what we thought we wanted to do in life, and that's okay. Not every dream is realized, and if what we have is good, that should be enough. And that job at Wild West is good, and my life in New York is good. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel the same way. Which is why I'm going to take that job at Wild West. Mm-hmm. It's everything I've been working toward. And you and I, I mean, we're both going to be just fine. Absolutely fine. Yeah. Yeah. Look, Rachel, I... Hey. Evening, Luke. Hi, Dolly. Well, is this? It's Rachel. I have heard so much about you. Well, I've... I've heard quite a bit about you, too! Obviously. I mean, you're... you're Dolly. You're Dolly Parton. I mean, everybody knows who you are. Well, they'd better, or we'll have to close this place down. [laughs] I just wanted to know if you're ready to do this thing. Yes. Well, come on. Let's do it. See you later, Luke. See ya. [cheering] Thank you all, and Merry Christmas to everybody. You know, I spend a lot of my time out on the road all through the year, and every time I walk into this park, I feel like I'm really home. And tonight, I want to welcome all of you, because it's your home too. You know, I've been told that you're known by the company you keep. Well, if that's so, I want you to judge me. Judge me by this wonderful team that has put all this together over the last 30 plus years. And I just want to ask you if you'll keep coming back. Because if you'll keep coming back to see us, I promise to be here for at least 100 years more. Is that a deal?

I just feel like this is where we're supposed to be, here in Pigeon Forge with all of you. Really? Can we stay here, Mommy? Would you want that, sweetie? Because all I ever want is to make you happy. I'd love to be here with Grammy and Papa, and Luke. Oh, well, uh, sweetie, he actually, um, he got a job somewhere else, but I'm sure he'll come back to visit. I'm going to miss him, too. But you and I have so much fun ahead of us. I'm going to put feelers out to do some events here. But not as many as in New York. Oh honey, I know so many people who'd love to use your services. Having you two here, I can't think of anything better. You know, this is what I hoped would happen. [laughs] We'll get Ava home. You stay and enjoy your party. Thanks. Thank you, Mommy. I love you. Oh, I love you too. Come on. [sighs] I know. I need to go find him. Mm-hmm. [knocking] Hey. Hey. Have you seen Luke? I've been looking for him everywhere and he's not answering his phone. Uh yeah, I saw him walk off with that guy from Wild West Amusements right after the tree lighting. ♪ Luke, it's... it's Rachel again. Are you still in the park? Please call me back, I, uh... I need to talk to you. Penny for your thoughts. Dolly! Well, that's the name my Momma gave me. [laughs] I thought it was a great night, and I always love to come out and thank everybody personally. And what are you doing on this stage alone? Oh, I... I was looking for Luke. I didn't say something that I should've said to him earlier. I think I messed up. Oh, it can't be all that bad. Even a bad haircut can be fixed. [laughs] You know, tonight really resonated with me. And you, everything you've built, your music, Dollywood, the Imagination Library. It's, it's so inspiring. Well, like I always say, you can have what you want if you believe you can have it. And you never gave up on yourself? Oh, in my career, I've had a lot of people tell me I was never going to make it. But my philosophy has always been, for those that say it can't be done, would you just please stop interrupting those of us that are doing it? [laughs] Words to live by. You know, Luke is one special guy, and he is going to make an exceptional general manager. Wait, he got it? He said you hired someone else. Well, we hired an assistant general manager, but Luke is our guy. I have to find him. Maybe I'll help you with that. No, I've been trying that. He's not answering his phone. Well, I might have a better connection around here than you. [laughs] Yep. Glacier Ridge. Five minutes. What? Told ya. Don't you just love happy endings? Thank you, Dolly. You better tell him. He's up on Glacier Ridge, so go tell him on the mountain. [laughs] ♪ Luke! Rachel, hi. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I was talking to Mark Haber earlier, and my phone was on silent, and... You... you... you can't take that job at Wild West. This is where you belong. I know. That's why I turned it down. [laughs] Well, you are going to make the best GM this park has ever seen. What are you talking about? You got it. I don't understand, I saw them hire that other guy. No, you saw them with your assistant GM. Really? Yeah. And Ava and I are staying here, too. In Tennessee. I... I don't want to settle for "good enough" anymore. You were right, I want to show Ava and I want to show myself that you can have the dream. And I am not giving up on myself this time. I'm not giving up on anything. Well, I have an idea. Me first. Now that's what I call a happy ending. [laughing] Oh, you know what? It... it looks like we missed one. Really? There it is. Oh. It's for you. It's from Dolly. What? It's my book. Why would Dolly give me a copy of my own book? Maybe she should look inside, huh? "Dear Rachel. "We are pleased to inform you that your book "has been chosen by Dolly's Imagination Library!" I was sworn to secrecy. This is incredible! Mommy, does that mean a whole bunch of little kids are going to get your book as a gift? Yes, sweetie. This, all of this, is better than any gift I ever could've dreamed of.
