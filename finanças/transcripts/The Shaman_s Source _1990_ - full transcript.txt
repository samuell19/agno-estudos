I heard you're supposed to hire people from Otter Lake. - Oh, you did, where'd you hear that? - The Band gave you guys a right to develop here to create employment for my people. - So where were you when we did the hiring? - I went hunting. - And now you just want to show up to work in your hunting clothes? - Sure, what's wrong with this? - Okay. At least today, you got a job. Tomorrow, I want safety boots. - [Mat] All right. (anxious electronic music) (low alternative rock music) - [Warner] Come on, come on, come on. That hole's gotta be wider, wider, come on, let's go. - Hey, look at the fancy apple from the big city. - Yeah, he's red on the outside but he's white on the inside. (chuckles) - It seems it don't matter how much a red apple works at it, he just can't seem to get white enough to make it in civilization. - Leave me alone, Robert. I'm just doing a job, I need the money. - Oh, is that your problem, Mat? You had to come all the way back here just because you couldn't get white enough? What's the matter? Can't the big city dude take the heat? What'd you come back for, Mat? A stupid job like this? Huh? You knew they had to hire you out here. We can't change who we are, peasant. And let me tell ya something. To them, we'll always be redskins. - Get off my back, preacher. (laughs) Goddamn klutz. (anxious ensemble tones) Welcome home, Mat. Don't let grandma see you like that. - Shit. - Robert Crow, dammit. Robert! This is private property. You cannot come around here and interrupt the work with your native rights crap. - I found some guy's body. (sharp tense violin tones) - You know, you people... Bronson, call the police. - Looks like he's been there awhile. We'll have to call in forensics. You don't have any ideas on this, do you? - No, you won't get any help from these boys either. - You better get some security. - Okay. - Well, that's it for the day. - Thanks. - We'll be in touch. - Okay, yeah. Mr. Stockwell will insist upon being informed. Thank you. Okay boys, that's it for today, you might as well go home. - Yeah, all right. - We workin' tomorrow? - I don't know. - What is this garbage? Don't call us, we'll call you? These men work here! - You know, I've had just about as much as I'm gonna take from you, Mr. Crow. - Yeah? What are you gonna do about it, big man? (anxious electronic tones) (soft guitar music) - All right. Okay. All right, bye. Warner says there'll be no work again tomorrow. They're still investigating the body and they have to bring in some experts. - What experts? - I don't know, Rob, I'm just telling you what the man said. - You're the Chief, why don't you know? - I'm not going to get involved in Northern Hunt's business. - Jesus Steve, if you'd found a body in the ground like we did, you wouldn't just shrug it off and leave it to a guy like Warner to take care off, would ya? - Rob, this is a police matter. - Police matter, my ass! Everyone knows that their solution is to kick the shit outta the Indian. That's what matters to the police. Come on, guys. (relaxed flute, electronic music) (relaxed ensemble music) (dramatic trumpet tones) - [Grandma] The place that, that the battle took place. The Iroquois had iron axes and muskets from the white people. All we had were bows and arrows and stone axes. - [Mat] So why didn't the Iroquois attack? - They were looking for the place of old, the shaman one. But the Ojibwa won the battle because they trusted and understood the Meme Gueste. The Water Spirit. You two used to play together all the time. Couldn't get you apart. You grew up, you started fighting. Why don't you two look after each other? (anxious electronic music) (car horn honking) (dog barking) - Can I help you? - I'm George Stockwell. - Sorry Mr. Stockwell, Mr. Warner is expecting you in the trailer down the road, go right ahead. - Are you telling me that we can't continue because some mummified Indians were found on my construction site? - That's the way things are done up here, George. - Well I have to pay bills down there. Stockwell Developments does not have the capital to fall behind schedule. What are those bodies doing there, anyway? I mean they should be full of worms by now. - Through some fluke, water seeped up into the graves after the bodies had been buried. You see, the soil is porous, meaning it was easy enough for the Indians to bury their dead and easy for water to move through. But they threw a clay on top which formed a cap on top of the graves, sealing it and keeping the water in. - So what does that mean to us? - It means finding the water here was simply a coincidence. - But it preserved all those bodies. - It has some remarkable properties but we have to find it first to use it. - It's just out on the job site. - No, that's already drying up. We need to find the source, which would be a subterranean spring. - [George] How do we get to the source? - We test and drill until we get a good map of what's underneath here. Then we follow it along until we find where the water comes to the surface. - It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. - In a sense, yes but with a magnet. - What magnet? - I was speaking metaphorically, the magnet is scientific knowledge. - Oh, what the hell do you mean by scientific knowledge? - I mean testing and drilling and having an expert on the site. - Meaning you? - Yes, Mr. Warner. I am a damn good geologist. The best in my field. That's why I was hired. - [George] What would it take to find this water, this spring? - I could do some preliminary testing. But then we'd need a special drilling rig and some time. - I want to find this spring as soon as possible. Warner, make the arrangements. Diana, order in one of those drilling rigs. We've got no time to lose. - It means going out in the bush, George. - Well I'll come. - That's not necessary. - Warner, I need to find that spring. This is business, I'm not interested in trout fishing. I am coming, is that clear? - Yes, George. - Stockwell Developments is concerned with your welfare. We're providing jobs and a future for native people. - Then leave us alone! Some things are too big to hide, Mr. Stockwell. Last night, we saw the open grave. There's a burial ground on that construction site. And we want some answers. - We're not trying to hide anything. - [Robert] Then why haven't you told us about the burial ground earlier? - I came here tonight to tell you all about our discovery. We had to wait for the report from the archeologists. They're making sure that those artifacts will last another 300 years for your children and their children to be proud of. - So when do we get back to work? - I'm afraid the work will have to be halted temporarily. - That's so we can remove the artifacts carefully. But once the archeologists are finished, we're going to start work again to develop this area and we're going to make it the biggest moneymaking project in the whole North. (clapping) There will be jobs for everyone. - But at what cost? - He's right. (anxious electronic tones) - Iroquois Spa. How does that sound to you, Jean-Paul? Iroquois Spa. - Sounds like a good beer to drink. Hey but these people aren't Iroquois, they're Ojibwa. - Iroquois sounds better. Iroquois Spa, Health and Recreation. That's where I'll build the lodge at the source of this spring. It could make a lot of money. The rich love luxury in the wilderness. - Sounds like a good idea. - Jean-Paul, my company must find this spring before anyone else. I checked the registry, no one has yet laid a claim. The first to do so will own the rights. Jean-Paul, I'd like to hire you as a guide. You'd be well paid. - It would be a pleasure. - And you know how to handle firearms and that sorta thing. - It's gonna cost you another couple of bucks but we can work it out, no problem. - Then you are my man. (anxious intermittent violin tones) - Can I help you? - Wow, I've never been in this part of the country before. I'm just delivering this drilling rig. By the way, would you know where Northern Hunt is? - Sure, there, just straight through the village there's a sign. - Far out. - What is that, anyway? - It's a water drilling rig. This heap is completely mobile. You can take her anywhere, drill in any terrain. It's wild. Very heavy. (crunching) - Good shot. I know what Northern Hunt's going after. - [Robert] What? - Water. I just saw them bringing in a water drilling rig over at the gas station. There's gotta be something special in that water. Maybe the water preserved those bodies they found. - [Robert] So what? - I'm telling you, water can be worth a lot of money. I've seen people pay three bucks for a little bottle of water at restaurants. - Yeah but that stuff is imported. You can charge whatever you want for it. - You bet. They're paying a lot of money for designer bottles. What about that drilling rig? Stockwell's not just looking for clean water. This could be worth millions to us, Rob. Imagine. You could be riding a big red Cadillac convertible. One chick here, one chick there, poppin' corks from champagne. - Hey. If there's millions to be made, the money goes back to the Band. Think what we could do around here if we had some real money. - What are we waiting for? Either we find the money first or we lose it to Northern Hunt. - Well how the hell do we find this special water? - I was hoping you'd know about that. - Okay guys, pack it in, I got things to do. - [Mat] Hey, where you going? - You think you got a good idea? Come on, let's put it to the test. (soft chanting) - I'm getting out of here, it's too goddamn hot. - Mat. Sit down. - The sweat will clean you out. Make you pure in solemn heart and your arms strong. You'll walk out of here a brave, ready for the fight. - Fight? - Long ago, the Water Spirits spoke to the Medicine Man of the Ojibwa and told him of the sacred source. It was a huge spring. The Iroquois heard about this spring and came up for it. The people, strong from the sacred source, defeat them but before he died in battle, the shamans forbid the use of the sacred source. My Guardian came to me in a dream and told me the Iroquois were coming again and we must gather a war party and fight them. You will need these. This contains a coarse missing feather. This contains the head of a tomahawk. - How do we get to the source from? - Take this pouch to Russ Thunder, he'll help you. - Russell Thunder? That guy can't even see straight. (chuckling) (bird screeching) (anxious guitar tones) (relaxed flute music) - So what do we do now? - We either stand still or we move. - So how do we get around? - You can't go around, you can only go through. - [Mat] What is this, trial by drowning? - [Robert] He's as crazy as his dead grandfather. - [Russell] Don't talk bad about shamans. It might come back on us. (anxious ensemble music) - We could cross on that log there. You know, 100 years ago, this was all Indian land, all of it. - What does it matter? The point is there's no future living on the Reserve. - No, there isn't, Mat and that's why we have to make some changes. - You never listen to anyone. - What, what do you want? You want all this? All this? Or your cockroach-infested slum back in the city? Well, what? (anxious ensemble music) - You paid top dollar for this hunk of junk? - Hey, it's all I could get on such short notice. - Hey, it's our fearless leader. - What do you know, we finally caught up to you. - I camp here tonight. - That's cool, come on Russ, get up. We still got a half a day of sunlight before we camp down. - How much further is it? - We go down the river, turn right for a couple hours, hit a rock face, turn right for another couple hours and then we should be at my grandfather's cabin, if it's still standing. - But we should be there before the sun goes down, right? - Yeah. Like my grandfather always said, when it's light out, keep moving unless you have to stop. - Hey, wait up. What about the fire? (anxious ensemble music) He's not gonna cross the river again. - Russ, where the hell are you going? - Where is this lunatic taking us? Great, we're three Indians lost in the middle of nowhere. - Hey! - I know, I know, this is our land and I'm in my happy home, hallelujah, brothers and sisters. - Hey Mr. Gould, everything okay? - Yeah man, this is heavy. I'm flashin' back to 'Nam. - Should we stop? - No problem, it's just a few minor hallucinations. - Let me speak to Diana. - Hey lady Di, it's Jacques Cousteau. - Diana here. - Hey, did you know you hired a maniac? (low anxious electronic music) (soft flute tones) - Years ago when I was a pup, my grandfather would sit here. He taught me how to read the pictographs that show the way to the sacred source. Yep. He sure found the source. Five Star whiskey, that's what he found. - This was a stupid idea. I never should have talked him into it. - Yeah, well we did and we're here and if by some miracle that we find that source, the money goes back to the Band. No one and I mean no one's gonna make a quick buck. - You're right. (anxious violin tones) - This was from the Otter League Band. - Out here? - Oh yeah, they roamed all over 'til they got put on the reserves. I've followed their seasons, the hunting, the fishing. I'm about the only guy I know that still does that. - Where'd you learn it? - From the Indians. The old ones. The new ones are scared to step off the Reserve. I tell ya, they're goddamn useless in the bush. - What's it supposed to mean? - Oh, it's just a pictograph. It shows a story or a piece of history. - 300 year old graffiti. - Yeah, something like that. - It's regrettable we don't have an expert to interpret those pictographs. A Jungian analyst would have a field day. - Well, you should've brought your shrink. - I don't have a, oh, you're impossible. (bird cawing) - So, there's a lot of money in this here water, eh George? - That's why we have to find it first. - And it goes to the guy who lands the claim first, eh? Like gold. - Like gold, Jean-Paul. Like gold. (anxious violin music) - Whoa, look out. Come on Russ, you can do it. Wow. I forgot how beautiful this is. Well, where's the cabin? (soft electronic music) - [Russell] There. - Christ, why did we climb the goddamn cliff if we could've walked around it? - You can't walk around it, you can only go straight. - [Mat] You're crazy, I'm tired of this shaman talk. - But isn't it a lovely view? (engine rumbling) (explosions booming) - Woo wee. Just like Saigon. - Quiet. Listen. Did you hear that? (explosions booming) - How's it look? - I've located the fracture. Now it's just a matter of physically getting through this geographical terrain to follow the subterranean stream to its source. - I wonder about you. - I'm pretty simple, really. Just a woman. - What's that supposed to mean? - I want things to be straightforward and direct. I don't want to waste time anymore. - Congratulations, I just entered the understanding females club. - Why are you like this with me? - Because I don't-- - Oh, what is it? Are you confused? Where have you been for the last thousand years? You know, I'm going to find that spring. I'm going to come out on top. But I'm not interested in you, so do yourself a favor and stop trying. Excuse me, I've got work to do. - Is he giving you a rough time? - I'm used to it. We're both looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. So who's schooling who? Warner and I are very alike. - What? - I only know science, the rest I don't understand. - I know the bush. - I should've been born a man. - Why? - Oh, just 'cause that's how I feel right now. Excuse me, I'm going to my tent. - How about that, I never understand the women. (slow intermittent drumbeat) - Rob, this is too much. He's leading us on a wild goose chase. - Come on, he knows what he's doing. - There it is, there it is. I told you my grandfather's cabin would be here. - Still wanna go back to the Res, buddy? - Okay, so the cabin's here. That still doesn't mean that Russ hasn't lost his marbles. - Yeah! - This kid's flipped his lid. - Yeah, I'd like to dump his booze. (soft flute music) (frog croaking) (anxious violin music) - Smoke, straight ahead. - Is that a forest fire? - No, it's more like a camp fire. Maybe a hunting party. - Indians? - Hey. Listen to this. I found some of Russ' poems. "Grandfather, "you have gone back to Mother Earth, "to the winds that gave you brave. "To the water that quenched your thirst. "To the sacred source you never found. "Your blood flows in my blood like "a might river, pushing me to the Great Spirit." - You (cursing in foreign language). - Hey! You're gonna kill him, you're gonna kill him! - That's the idea. (tense violin tones) You bastards. - This stuff's really beautiful. - Yeah, I shouldn't have read it out loud. It wasn't right. God knows what he'll do now. - I'm gonna go find him. (soft electronic music) - Stay back, I'll check this out. Hello? Hello? Anybody home? All clear, you can come down now. This is a fine carving. - [George] I thought you said there weren't any Indians out here. - Well it looks like there is now, eh? - Federation of Native Rights. Card-carrying member, Robert Crow. - Robert Crow. He's the agitator that was at the Council meeting. - Hey, I heard that the FNR are under investigation for subversive activities. - Subversives, nah. No, they're just trying to get some treaties honored that were signed and then broken years ago. - How many Indians are there, Jean-Paul? - There are three. - They must be following us. - No George, no, I think it's just coincidence we've caught up with them. - They're after that spring, I know it. - Oh, you can't be sure. - Hey, take a look at this. Some museum will pay good money for this. - Gimme that. Hello? Come in Diana, are you there? - Yeah Mr. Stockwell, she's here. Here sweetheart, it's the man. - Yes, I can hear you. Yes. Yes, all right. - What's cooking, lady Di? - Stockwell wants some dynamite. - Just like that? - He has his reasons. - And so did Attila the Hun. - Russ. Russ? It'll be all right, buddy. - Really Russ, I'm sorry. - We're useless. We're all bloody useless. - No we're not and we're gonna find that source. Right? Right? - Yeah. Yeah. (explosion booms) (explosion echoing) - I still think you were wrong to blow up their supplies. - Don't be a bleeding heart, Warner. - What are they supposed to do for food? - Hey Warner, I believe in that famous saying by that famous guy Freud, eh? Survival of the fittest. - Jesus Christ, they blew up the whole goddamn cabin! - Grandfather's staff, where is it? Where is it, did they destroy it? - They must've taken it 'cause it was right here. - Maybe they'll blow us up next time, we could be dead. - What's the matter Mat, don't you want your fortune? - It's not worth dying for. - Well what are we gonna do, Mat? We've turned the other cheek for long enough. - They took my staff! - Come on. It's time we did some tracking. (anxious violin music) (anxious electronic tones) - Here. I've done it. I know where the source of the spring is. - [George] Where? - Here. - Where? - Take a look. We've been moving in this direction since we started here following this band of limestone. Now it's getting narrower, which means we're close to cutting into a fissure. - Are you sure that means we've hit it? - Yes it does, absolutely. The limestone is heading to this rock formation. Now, by compression the area should be close to a point where the water surface is. Of course we'll need to help it along. - Does this mean we leave the battlefield and get back to drilling? - Yes, it does. Just one more time in exactly the right position. - Well done, Miss Casey. - Congratulations, Princess Di. (low, anxious ensemble music) - [Russell] Take a look at this. - [Robert] Fresh tracks. - It looks like caterpillar treads. - Northern Hunt. I knew it. They're the ones that blew up that cabin. - Well, I'm goin' to catch some Z's. There's a lot to do tomorrow. Who knows what else we'll blow up. Maybe we'll even do some drilling. Isn't that why I'm here? Goodnight. - See ya tomorrow. - Yeah, me too. I guess I'm gonna go saw some lumber. Bonsoir. - Goodnight. This discovery will do a lot to bolster my career. - I for one am very happy that you'll have made it. - Yeah, well don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Anyway, I think I'm gonna leave you two for the night to pat yourselves on the back to your heart's content. - What's wrong with a little celebration? - You two are drunk with greed. I think I'd better turn in before I say something I regret. - That man is an ungrateful bastard. As soon as this job is over, I'm going to reevaluate his position with the company. - Reevaluate? - It translates to show him the door. - Warner's a good man, he has principles. - Would you like a drink, Diana? - No George, I'm tired. - To Iroquois Spa. (anxious electronic tones) - Russell. (rattling) Russell Thunder, take back the staff of your grandfather, stolen by the Iroquois. Follow my spirit. (bird screeching) (low, anxious electronic music) (anxious electronic music) (dramatic rock tone) (gunshot booms) - What the hell was that? - Do you think it's Russ? - I don't know but he doesn't have a gun, come on. - Where are your other partners? - The staff belongs to me. It belongs to my grandfather and his before him. It's not yours to take. - Hey man, is that really his cane? - I'll take anything I want. Now where's this troublemaker, Robert Crow? - We need a diversion. - We owe Russ one. (low anxious electronic, flute music) Check this out, Robert. I learned it in the city, urban warfare. When I light this-- - Yeah. I know. Run like hell. - You got it, Pontiac. - I'll ask you one more time. Where are the other two Indians? (explosion booms) - You blew up my rig! (gunshots booming) - Warner, get the one with the staff. Come on, Jean-Paul. - My rig is dead. (anxious violin music) - [George] Hold it! (gunshot booms) - There they are. (gunshots booming) - [Mat] Holy shit, Jesus. - Nowhere else to run to, boys. You really know how to piss me off. Where is he? Where's the other one? - He got away with the staff. - You idiot. Couldn't you keep track of him? Okay, take these two over there and tie them up. - Hey. - Tight! - Hey, why are you tying those two boys up? Who do you think you are, Buffalo Bill? - [George] Wise ass. - I needed to find one more core sample. Just one more and now this. - Well we can still find the spring, can't we? - I don't see how. - Goddammit! All right you wise ass, either you tell me what I want to know or I pull the trigger. - We're just following you. We don't know anything. - Stockwell, over here. (whispering) They will never know. - Jean-Paul, you're brilliant. All right, we break camp. (anxious ensemble tones) - I can't believe it, how can they do this to us? - Oh, they can do it. - These people are serious. - They're dangerous, Mat. They'll kill us, they've always killed us. - Just to make a dollar? - You see, that's why it pisses me off to hear you talk about gettin' rich quick. It just, just goes against our own way of thinking, that's all. - The Res is no better than the city, Rob. Why do you think I left it? There's just as much hate, just as much violence, just as much greed here as anywhere else. We're no better, we're just different. - No, we're not just different. We are Ojibwa, they stole our land. - Yes, they stole our land, you're right. But listen to yourself, Robert. You hate the whites like they hate us. What makes you think that if you had the power, you wouldn't do to them what they've done to us? You're out to kill them. - So you just gonna leave those two boys there to die? Look man, I don't want to be part of this. I was hired as a rig operator. I'm not here to witness any of this racist garbage. - It's none of your business. - Look man, it is my business if somebody gets killed. You can play your sick games without me. Are you people really gonna follow your leader until the end? - Hey, there's lots of money to be made. - Look, we'll calm things down. - Yeah, good luck. - You'll get lost. - I might get lost but you're misguided and he's a total wacko. I'm going to follow the rig tracks back. I'm history, baby, history, history. - [Russell] I need a drink. (anxious ensemble tones) (birds chirping) - Can't see the stars in the city. I guess you need to experience one thing to appreciate another. Hey man, we're tied up and we're talking about the dark. - Remember when we were kids and we looked for our animals in the sky? You were a bear and I was a wolf. - Rob, we're in deep shit here. - I don't wanna face the Great Spirit without a death song. - I don't believe in Great Spirits or death songs. I don't believe in civilization. I feel like a guy without a spirit. - You have a spirit, Mat. - If you fall asleep, maybe you won't wake up. - Maybe. - Rob. Rob, I'm really scared. (relaxed flute music) (howling) (thunder booming) (anxious ensemble music) (shivering) - I need, I need a drink. I need a drink. - [Grandfather] Russell. Russell. You will find the source in the vision of the eagle. (eagle screeching) (anxious rock tones) (eagle screeching) - Grandfather, you're all I've got. Please give me strength. - Rob. Rob. - What? - What do we do? - Oh. Shit. - [Mat] I should make a lot of noise, that'll scare it. - No, no, don't, don't don't. - What if it sprays? - You don't move, the skunk doesn't spray, all right? - I never knew that Rob, I never believed it. (roaring) What is it, what's behind me? - Quit the noise, for Christ's sake. You look like you saw the Great Spirit. - Russ? Jesus. - You guys can sure get yourselves into a mess. - [Mat] Come on Russ, we were just trying to help you. - The spirit of my grandfather came to get me last night, look. Steady. He got me through it, I feel great. - You seen Northern Hunt anywhere? - No, I think they went on. - Wherever they are, they're half a day ahead of us. - You okay? - Yeah. It's just my wrists. - We should keep moving. Last night I found a pictograph that my grandfather never discovered. I know we can find the source. - Well, what are we waiting for? - [George] Like gold, Jean-Paul. If you're right about that staff leading us to the spring, it's just like gold. - There it is. (low, anxious electronic tones) The tree marks the spot where the sacred source is. - Yeah but where is it? (eagle screeching) (dramatic rock tones) - Up there. (low, anxious ensemble tones) - Shh. (anxious electronic tones) Dammit. Okay, you carry on to the spring and Mat and I will try to slow 'em down, all right, you got that? Come on. Hi. - Help! Help! (gunshot booms) - [Robert] Come on, get up. (gunshot booms) - Let's get those bastards. (dramatic rock tones) (low, anxious electronic music) - What now? (eagle chirping) - [Russell] This way. (relaxed electronic music) (eagle chirping) - They didn't just vanish. - No sign of any tracks. - Let's double back and see where we lost the trail. (relaxed ensemble music) - [Shaman] Long ago, the Water Spirit spoke to the medicine man of the Ojibwa and told him of the sacred source. The Iroquois heard about this spring and came up for it. But before he died in battle, the shamans forbid the use of the sacred source. - [Grandma] The Iroquois had iron axes and muskets from the white people. All we had were bows and arrows and stone axes. (relaxed flute music) - [Shaman] This contains a coarse missing feather. This contains the head of a tomahawk. Take this pouch to Russell Thunder. (relaxed ensemble music) (rattling) When my Guardian came to me in a dream, he said the Iroquois were coming again and that we must gather a war party to fight them. It will make your eyes true and your arms strong. You'll walk outta here a brave, ready for the fight. (anxious violin music) (dramatic trumpet tones) (mid tempo drumbeat) (dramatic rock tones) (eagle screeching) - [George] I'm sick of beans. - I thought you liked my cooking. It's my father's recipe, it keeps the bears away. - Those Indians didn't just vanish, Jean-Paul. - Underground, that's where the spring could be. The Indians could be below us right now. - Hey, I've been tracking all my life, Mr. Stockwell. I've tracked wolf, fox and bear but I can't track when there's no tracks to track. - I think we should just leave here Warner before anyone gets hurt. I'm frightened. - You? What about finding the spring? (tense ensemble music) (gunshots booming) - Where they coming from? - [Jean-Paul] Damn, a fire started. (machine gunfire clacking) - [Warner] Grab what we can. - Come on. - [Warner] Just get outta here. (machine gunfire clacking) (tense ensemble music) - [Russell] That was a warning. You have until sunrise to leave. We will defend the source to the death. - Look at us, we're waving guns around. Jean-Paul's happily shooting at people, George is going crazy. I want to leave. - Okay, I'm with you all the way. I'll just tell George and then we'll go. - Let's just go, I don't care about the spring or this job. It isn't worth getting killed for. - I'll tell him and then we'll go. Look, we're leaving and I think you should too. There's nothing to be gained by this madness. - Warner. - These people are serious. What's the point of staying? Let the law deal with it. - Warner, you're staying. - I'm leaving! - Jean-Paul. - Hey, this is exciting. And I'm not going to let a million bucks slip through-- - [Warner] Yeah, well you're crazy. - Warner, you're scared, aren't you? Of what, the Indians? (anxious ensemble music) (low, anxious ensemble music) (anxious ensemble tones) (gunfire clacking) I shot one. Where'd he go? - You wait here, I'm gonna go see if everything's okay. - [Diana] Warner, are you crazy? I'm not staying here alone. - [Jean-Paul] Blood. We'll follow the trail. (gunshot booms) (tense electronic music) - [Warner] Dynamite. (gunfire clacking) - Oh. (gunfire clacking) - [Warner] Stay here, stay here. - But... - Close up the source. - Take him down and I'll take care of them. (relaxed electronic tones) (grunt) (gunfire clacking) (distant coughing) - Warner. No. Oh no. (low, anxious ensemble tones) (faint coughing) - [George] Where's your friend? Hey, if you wanna see him live, you better come out. (water sloshing) (gunshots booming) (eagle screeching) (laughing) (water sloshing) (gunshot booms) (soft anxious ensemble music) (Diana screams) (tense rising ensemble tones) (relaxed electronic music) (explosion booms) (ducks quacking) - [Russell] Grandfather, you have gone back to Mother Earth. Your blood flows in my blood like a mighty river pushing me to the Great Spirit. (dramatic electronic music) (chanting) * Gimme your life * Gimme your heart, that's what I need * * Show me the place * Mystical race, eternal souls * Run * Run water, run * Brave * Brave brother, brave * By the spring of life * By the spring of life * Brave brothers, brave brothers * (mid tempo ensemble rock music) * By the spring of life * Feel the love * The scene of life, the rite of bone * * The pathway lives in the plane that's on your mind * * I said run * Run water, run * I said brave * Brave brother, brave * By the spring of life * By the spring of life * Brave brothers, brave brothers * (mid tempo ensemble rock music) * Now the water * Shall come for all to see * The sky cloudy with the vision bringing lightning * * That's what I've seen * Great coils on the sound * And that's why I'll stay * By the spring of life * Brave brothers, brave brothers * (mid tempo ensemble rock music) * Brave brothers * Brave brothers (relaxed electronic tones)
