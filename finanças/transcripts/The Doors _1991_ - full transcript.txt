"The movie will begin in five moments," the mindless voice announced. "All those unseated will await the next show." We filed slowly, languidly into the hall. The auditorium was vast and silent. As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued. "The program for this evening is not new." "You have seen this entertainment through and through." "You've seen your birth, your life and death." "You might recall all of the rest. Did you have a good world when you died?" "Enough to base a movie on?" Hey, Jim. It's your birthday, man. What d'you say we finish this another night? Turn the lights down a little bit more, will you, J? Hey, man, how come The Doors aren't in on this? No music, no Doors. Come on, let's roll. Rolling. Is everybody in? Is everybody in? Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin. "Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god." "Wandering, wandering in hopeless night." "Out here in the perimeter there are no stars." "Out here we is stoned." "Immaculate." ♪ Riders on the storm ♪ It's beautiful. Look at those big, fluffy clouds. ♪ Riders on the storm ♪ Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, wake up and look at the clouds.

What's your name? - Mine's Jim. - Pam. Pam and Jim. Who the hell was that? I have no idea. Nietzsche said, "All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks" "in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity." Listen, children, to the sound of the Nuremberg night. In the seance, the shaman leads a sensuous panic. He acts like a madman. A professional hysteria. Have you ever seen God? A mandala. - A symmetrical angel. - This is bombastic. - Shut up! - We got our final vision by clap. Columbus' groin got filled with green death. I touched her thigh... This film is weird! And death smiled. Hey, Morrison. Fuck 'em, man. It's great. It's non-linear. It's poetry. It's everything Godard stands for. This world. The monster of energy. Without beginning. Without end. Likewise, without increase or income... disclosing nothing... this world... This world is a will to power and nothing besides. Pretty pretentious there, Jim. Not easy to follow. A little incoherent. But, uh... dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation, what's next? What do you guys think? - It was poor, man. I hated it. - It was better than a Warhol picture, man. - No, it wasn't! It was worse! - A guy sleeping for seven hours? There was no political consciousness. - You need your art spoon-fed to you. - Hey, man, right on! All right, hold it down. Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks. - You're bringing me down. - Oh, shut up! Mr. Morrison?

That's beautiful. - Did you like that? - It's beautiful. I've never read much poetry before. What's a shaman? It's a medicine man... of the Indians. He gets into a peyote trance... and he gets deeper and deeper, and then he has a vision... and the whole tribe is healed. All cultures have a version of it. The Greeks have theater and gods. The Indians say the first shaman invented sex. They call him "The One Who Makes You Crazy". What turns you on? I don't know. Um... Experience. Freedom. Love. Now. Did you know that the first time I did acid, I saw God? And I saw a friend of mine, who was Christ, but he was Judas, too. And then I realised that somehow that was the secret of everything. We're all one. The universe is one. And that everything is beautiful. I don't know. I feel most alive... confronting death... experiencing pain. I think you're most alive by recognizing beauty. Seeing truth. Does death turn you on? You love death? Life hurts a lot more. When you die, the pain's over. All the poems have wolves in it. All but one. The most beautiful one of all. She dances in a ring of fire. And throws off the challenge with a shrug. That's beautiful. Who did you write that for? I wrote it for you. ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ The best ♪ Om! - Try acid, Ray. - Oh, shit!

Yeah, I got in to see the head of production over there and he said, "Where is your script?" I said, "I don't need a script. "Godard doesn't use a script, he improvises with a camera." He says, "Great. Who's Godard?" I'm off movies, man. I went out to the desert, got lost. I've been living up on Trick's rooftop. - Got stuck on a chick. - So what else you doing? Writing.

You can feel it in the air. People wanna fight or fuck, love or kill. Vietnam is right out there, man. Sides are being chosen. Everything's gonna flame, man. The planet is screaming for change, Morrison. We gotta make the myths. There ought to be great orgies, man. Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece. He made all the women mad, leaving their homes and dancing off into the mountains. There should be great golden copulations in the streets of LA, man. - We should call ourselves Dionysus, man. - I got a name. Doors. You mean, the doors in your mind?

I have one little thing to bring up. It's a small thing, but it's important. The guys at network have told us they have a problem with one of your lyrics. It's the lyric, "Girl, we couldn't get much higher." See, 'cause you can't say, "higher" on network, so they asked if you could say instead, "Girl, we can't get much better." Can you dig that? How about, "Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"? I don't think Standards and Practices would... And, fellas, why don't you have a nice big smile on your face when you get out there?

He's in one of Andy's movies - I, a Man. - And this is Count Ruspoli. - Ruspoli. He's Italian, but he lives in Paris. He's from a very famous family, 700 years old. Hi, Jim. You are great.

Wow. We really like your music. - How you doing, Andy? - Oh, great. And there were so many people at the show... the paintings were getting crushed and they had to take them all down, so... It really looked kind of... - Uh, great. - Just the walls. You see, Andy was the art. You should do a show with just bare walls. We'd like to use you in one of our movies, Jim. You're really such a beauty, and, uh... Hear with Andy said? Someday, everybody will be famous for 15 days... - You'd really be great. Wouldn't he? - Yes. I mean... It's the singer, not the song. It's the astronaut, not the voyage. Or in the vernacular view, it's the trip, not the arrival. Somebody gave me this telephone. - I think it was Edie, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was Edie. Yeah. And she said that, um... I could talk to God with it, but I don't have anything to say. Here. This is for you. Um... Now, you can talk to God. - Andy! - Oh! Hi! Morrison.

I'm interested in, uh... chaos, disorder... especially activities which seem to have no meaning, like this. - Mr. Morrison... - On behalf of the British press... How do you feel about being called "The ultimate Barbie doll"? Well, I guess when you say something like that, it's a shortcut to thinking. And do you think about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has got? I guess they didn't understand. Is it true you financed its publication? Have you bothered to read the poetry, ma'am? I mean, you keep denying that nothing good can come out of LA. I think that's a rather provincial attitude. - Do you believe in drugs, Mr. Morrison? - I believe in excess. What about alcohol? Ls that considered part of the shaman's wisdom? It's the American way. You know, we spend more money every year on tobacco and alcohol than we do on education? Mr. Morrison, on behalf of the British press... Where do you see The Doors five years from now? - It's an excuse for free sex. - What do you spend your money on? I believe in a long, prolonged derangement of the senses to attain the unknown. I live in the subconscious. Our pale reason hides the infinite from us. Are you by any chance in a trance now, Mr. Morrison? Do you hurt? What? What hurts you the most? What do your parents think about what you're doing? Actually, I don't remember being born. It must have happened during one of my blackouts. They must have expressed some feeling. Well... to tell you the truth, they're not living any more, so I really don't like to talk about that. Could you at least tell us how they died? It was a... horrible car crash in New Mexico. In the '50's. My father ran right into a truckload of Navajos. They were... all over the highway, bleeding. Their souls, kind of stirring in the breeze, just leapt into mine. I'm sorry. Mr. Krieger, do you really consider Mr. Morrison a shaman? ♪ Take the highway to the end of the night ♪ ♪ End of the night ♪ ♪ End of the night ♪ ♪ Take a journey to the... ♪ Don't worry about it. It happens to other guys, too. Wanna do some coke? It'll loosen you up. Sure. A new thing. Wow! How old is this? That's, uh, 14th century. - Witchcraft. - Religion, you know. Witchcraft. Witches are the protectors of the seasons. Goddesses of the grain. And when crossed... destroyers. You ever try drinking blood? What? It works, you know. Drink it at the right time of the moon. They used to dance in the forests, naked. See, I think that that's what offended the Puritans and led to the burnings. They were a sexual threat to their male order, like the Bacchae. Five days a year, for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills of ancient Greece. The first witches. Clans of wild women... looting... fucking... eating animals raw... looking for Dionysus... to tear him to pieces! Where do you get the blood? Blood is the rose of a mysterious union. Symbol of potency. Now you. I can't cut myself. Don't be such a child. If I do it, you have to do it. You do it. Aah! Aah! Come on, rock-god! Fuck me! Fuck me good! Come on, rock-god. Baby. All right! What do you want me to do? What can I do, baby? Huh? - What's the matter, baby? - Will you die for me? What do you want me to do, huh? - What do you want me to do? - Maybe I should see a doctor or something. What do you think, someone from the Freudian philosophy? It happens to other guys, too. You know, that's the irony. Teenage death girls want my dick, not my words. It's not so complicated. It's just sex, you know. I'll never wake up in a good mood again. It's the hours and the pressure. You do everything like it's your last performance. We weren't built to last. You never know. - You're setting yourself up, you know. - You never know. You're a poet, not a rock star. Do you really know what I am, Pam? - You know what poetry is? - You don't belong on The Ed Sullivan Show. Who am I? Where's the feast they promised us? Where's the new wine? Dying on the vine. See, I lied to you. I love fame. I do love fame. - Why are you doing this to me? - 'Cause you're in the room. And that's gonna help? That's gonna help? Maybe you could just put a little soul in your success. Suck it, mommy. Come on. - Fuck you! - Hey, where you going, huh? Where do you think you're going, huh? Come on. Love my girl! How many guys have you fucked since you've been with me? How many dogs have you fucked? You're the only one who couldn't make it, you asshole. You are the only limp dick in the lot! - Will you die for me? - No! - Will you die for me? Answer me! - No! Will you die for me? No! Sure. I'd die for anybody. Shit! - Will you die for me? - Yes. - I don't believe you. Say it! - Yes. Yes. Yes. - Die for me. - Yes. Yes. - Will you die for me? I'm just a clown. - Yes. Am I a clown? - I need a home. - With me. A place to hide. I'm sorry, baby. We're gonna fuck death away. Come on. Let's fuck death away. Come on, baby. All right! All right! An ancient lunatic reigns in the trees of the night. The Doors! The Doors! The Doors! Look. Hello. We've got a serious problem up here. The fire marshal is not going to let this concert go on unless you clear the aisles and you go back to your seats. Unless you clear these aisles, there is no show. The sound of the crowd. I don't even like rockers. They're sleazy. Shit! - Come on, now. Like Nuremberg. - You'd like that? - Like that? - Like Germans. - Beg! - I'm begging! - You wanna fuck me, huh? - Yeah. Don't ever fucking lie to me again. About what? Your father. Why do you tell me bullshit, like your father's dead? - He is dead. Both of them. I told you. - Yeah? If he's so dead, who answered the phone when I called? What? What? You didn't really think you were getting away with that, do you? Your father's an admiral in the United States Navy. He was at the Gulf of Tonkin when the Vietnam War breaks out. Your dad's Deputy Chief of Operations. Just don't ever lie to me again, okay? Unless you clear these aisles... What? Shut the doors! You shouldn't have done that. What, like it's so hard to trace your school records. I mean, you went to, uh, the University of Florida. Albuquerque, New Mexico. Arlington, Virginia. Washington, D.C. You have a brother and a sister. "Seven miles long, baby." It's all in "The End". Where the fuck is Jim? Man, I have no idea. What is with this guy? I'm sorry. What did he do? Did he love you? How much? Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Your mama? Hatred's a very underestimated emotion. Doesn't matter anymore, does it? Do you hear them out there? Are you listening to them? Jim! Jim! Jim! It's you they want now. It's not The Doors. It's not your mother or your father's child. It's you. They don't want me. They want my death. Ripped to pieces. Patricia, just hold me. What are you doing there? - Nothing. - Okay. Both of you out of there. No one's allowed backstage. Come on, let's go! - You idiot, don't you know who this is? - It's cool. I'm with the band. - No, listen, let's go, come on. - Hey, cool it, pig! - Fucking hippie! - Fuck you! You motherfucker! - Aagh! Aagh! - Aagh! Jesus! - They got Jim! - I've been Maced! What's happening here? What the fuck is going on here? What are you doing? I'm blind! - I'll issue a warrant for his arrest. - Are you nuts? Come on. We gotta get you on.

I was with this girl backstage. We wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower stall. - We weren't doing anything, just talking. - Yeah, right! All of a sudden, this little... this little man came in... with a little blue hat and a little blue suit. And he said, "What you doing in there?" I said, "Nothing." And he said, "Well, you better get out of there or, uh..." "Or what?" I said. And he started pushing me. Yeah, so I started pushing back! He didn't like that. Yeah. Then he reached behind and he pulled out a little can of Mace. And he sprayed it right in my eyes. Fucking blinded me! Why? All because I was alone in a room with a girl? Doing what he'd like to be doing if he could get it up without a gun. All right. In the United States of America, man. Land of the free, home of the brave. In God we trust! No, no, no. Say your thing, man. Mr. Morrison, you've gone too far. The show's over. You've violated state obscenity laws. You're under arrest! There you go. Get out of the way, everyone! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Get back! Get back! Get your hands off me, you slaves. This isn't happening to me. It's happening to you! Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality. That's all, I was curious. I kind of always preferred to be hated. Like Erich von Stroheim in the movies. The man you loved to hate. It's meant to be ironic. Like... courage wants to laugh. Essentially, a stupid situation. I go out on the stage and howl for people. In me, they see exactly what they want to see. Some say Lizard King, whatever that means... or some black-clad leather demon, whatever that means. But really, I think of myself... as a sensitive, intelligent human being... but with the soul of a clown that always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moments. I'm a fake hero. A joke the gods played on me. Morning. Pour me my breakfast, Dolores. What's the matter with Jimbo? Can't handle it, eh? He's pussy whipped, man. Hey, Jim, eat this, man. We got one last place to go. Ray's getting married this morning, remember? Alive, she cried. Oh, I can't eat that. It'll make me sick. Give me a Dos Equis, will you, Dolores? And a Ramos fizz. What happened to you last night? You bet me a grand you were gonna walk on the ledge of the 9000 building after the gig. Let's go right now! Complaining about going home to your sanctuary. We were gonna make a fucking movie. You bet me a 1,000 bucks, man. Give him a double. A triple. Imagine me and Morrison in a movie together. - Yeah! - Two powerful, two Irish, two-fisted, fucking drinking guys in the same movie together! Yeah, man, I'll direct the shit out of it. Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do it. We'll all three direct it. A real road movie though. In black and white. We'll call it Zero. Yeah. What the fuck?! Fuck you, Morrison! Get out of here! Fucking jackoff! Leave the drinks. It's only another 95,000. But I could get the best clothes from India, from Morocco, Jim, clothes you couldn't get anywhere else. And then we could get the richest people to come. Miles Davis, Sonny and Cher, the Stones. It could be the best boutique on La Cienega, Jim. - Why don't we have a car? - We lost it. Yeah, but... Where's the Gravy Train? Grav...? What's the matter with you? What are you on? - You said you wouldn't drink today. - No, Ma, I ain't drinking. You promised you wouldn't drink. You're not gonna drink anymore, are you, Jim? No, Ma, I ain't. And you'll change those stinky leathers you've been wearing for three weeks. - Nah, I don't know about that. - What are you on? Ooh, it's just some low-grade acid. It's not heavy. Oh, Jim! Oh! God! You know, I cooked! I cooked the duck! - Oh, baby, it's okay. - And people are coming, you know. Ray and Dorothy think that we're flaky enough, and you said we would wait until after and now you're gonna peak before me. No, no, it's cool. We'll trip and then we'll eat our feast. Yeah, sure. No! No! I think it's a good thing about Ray and Dorothy. I do, they... Women are such noble creatures. They carry on your name with dignity after you die. Are you saying you want to marry me, Jim Morrison? You know, I think women have basically a comic approach to life. How can they not? They have to spend their lives with that big dick seeking entry.

Jim, you really need somebody to organize all this stuff. Your handwriting is just like a little kid. Look at this. I wonder if William Blake was ever this disorganized. Honey. - You're trying too hard. - I'm gonna be your editor now.

She wrote this great review of my poetry book. - Jim, why don't we go eat that turkey? - Come on, Pam, let's go set those plates. - Are you Patricia Kennealy? - You must be Pamela. You actually put your dick in this woman, Jim? Well... Sometimes, yeah. Well, I understand, I really do. But just don't you ever expect that Jim's gonna love you or take care of you, because you're one of a hundred. - Come on, you don't know when to stop. - Look who's talking. I think Jim can make up his own mind about who he loves and who he doesn't. Don't kid yourself, sweetheart. He's crazy, but he's not that crazy. - He loves me. - Let's go check on those sweet potatoes. Here they go again. It's gonna be another one of those dinners. Chuck! Hey! Glad you made it.

You killed my duck! You killed my duck! - You ruined my... - Pamela, Pamela, please behave, huh? - Come on, Jimmy. - We'll work it out, man. It's okay. It's okay. Uh, Jim... - You want to know what murder is? - No! - You want a little death? - No! Yeah? Well, come on. You want a little death? Then kill me. Go on. Kill me. Come on! Kill me! Go on! Come on!

How do you plead? The defendant pleads not guilty, Your Honor. Then trial is set for the week... Your Honor, I want to bring to this jury's attention the fact that there's playing right now on Broadway a musical called Hair, where the actors disrobe and appear naked on the stage. - Objection. That's irrelevant... - Sustained. - Objection. That's irrelevant... - Sustained. - Your Honor, how can you sustain that? - Stick to the facts, Counselor. This is a major First Amendment violation by the politicians and the police of Miami. Every single witness they've brought here has testified to not actually seeing my client's genitals, except one who is related to the arresting officer. I tell you, if you convict on such lack of evidence, I assure you that someday, somewhere, in the still of the night, you will wake up screaming. Are you gonna get rid of it? Look... Wouldn't it be better to have a kid with someone that wanted to be its father? Fucking genius, that's what it'd be. You and me... the child would be a goddess or a god. It'd be a monster. Look, I... I got this trial that's hanging on me, and I can't afford this. I don't want the responsibility. You're a coward! Just a little boy! The only way you can't afford it is emotionally! Those vows were forever in the Goddess's sight. Death does not part, only lack of love. Come on, Patricia. I was stoned. It seemed like a fun thing to do at the time. Fuck you. I'm gonna have the kid. Well, then, it will be your kid. But if you want the abortion, I'll be there with you. - Oh, no, you won't! - Yes, I will. Oh, bullshit, Morrison, you know who you are! What difference does it make? You know, you never pretended. I did. You know, I don't even like kids particularly. I don't want the other fucking thing, either. You looked in the mirror lately? - Look at that stomach. - Come on, now. Don't say these things. James Douglas Morrison... I hereby sentence you... six months of hard labor in the Dade County Jail. And for public exposure, I am sentencing you to 60 days of the same, after which you are to serve two years and four months of probationary time. Your Honor, I have an appellate bond of the sum of $50,000 here. I ask that Mr. Morrison remain free pending his appeal. Everywhere, Jim. Jacksonville, Dallas, even Kent State University, canceled. The press, for the first time, they really turned against us. We're fucked. Pamela's called six times. Katherine, Patricia, Judy. Gayle's pregnant, she says. You gotta go to the dentist. Look, Jim, go home, get some sleep, get back to your words, okay? - And wash your hair. - Take a bath, too, man. - Jesus, Jim, this guy despises you. - We weren't even invited to Woodstock. - Twenty other bands. Not us. - First Hendrix, now Janis. Radio stations are pulling us from their playlists. The big cities. Philly, Cincy, Chicago, Detroit. You can drag this appeal out for years, Jim. We can keep you out of jail. The FBI's behind it, Jim. They had memos on you in Phoenix. They extradited you to Miami illegally. A new image. We can build it back slow, quiet, with the beard, the elder of the tribe. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord! The band you love to hate. Let's win there. Thank you very much. It was fun. I think I'm having a nervous breakdown. - Do you hear me, Jim Morrison? - I'm on the edge, baby! - We're rolling, Jim! - Pretty good, baby! Jump! I want you to come back in here this minute, Jim Morrison! I am not going to kill myself for you. - Goddammit, Jim! - Jump! Your whole life is bullshit! - Shut up! - If you want me, come on out and get me! No! No! Pam, where are you going? Pam, get back inside! Pam, don't... I love you! - Shit! - I love you, honey. Whoa! - Come on, baby. - Jim, give me your hand, man. All right, Jim, once more with feeling, take two! - I don't want to die. - Come on, baby. We gotta write "LA Woman", man. We gotta finish it. - I don't have an ending, Ray. - It has wolves in it. - Come on, girl. - The most beautiful... - Man, you're both gonna die! - ♪ I see your hair is burning ♪ The most beautiful one of all. Dances... in a ring of fire. And throws off the challenge with a shrug. That's my girl. Oh! Let's go. Let's go and leave this place. Just you and me, baby. We can, you know. Just one more step... No, no, no, no, don't. I want to live! I want to live with you! All the poetry has wolves in it, Pam. All but one. The most beautiful one of all. I hope you go out smiling... like a child into the cool remnant of a dream. The angel man... finally claimed this benevolent soul. Ophelia. Leaves, sodden in silk. Chlorine dream. Mad stifled witness. Yo, Jim! All right. - Hey, Dorothy. Oh, you cut your hair. - Yeah, we're trying to have another baby. What, was your hair getting in the way? Listen, where's Ray? I gotta catch a plane. Um, he's upstairs. - Okay, and where's Princess? - Out back. We added a rain effect to "Riders", man. It's great. It's the best album since Days, man. I must admit, pretty good for four guys who weren't even talking to each other that day. So you're really gonna live in Paris, huh, man? Yeah, you know, be anonymous. Write a book. "Observations Of An American While On Trial In Miami". Still got a lot of good songs in you, man. Still think we got a couple of blues albums in us. I'm pinned, man. They got a category for everything we do. I'm a wanted man. I'm gonna miss you, man. I'm gonna miss that feeling of playing music with you, man. You, John, miss me? More than you think, asshole. Yeah. You can always whip the horse's eyes. As far as I'm concerned, I made music with Dionysus. We had moments on stage that no one'll ever fucking know. Now, you lay off those drugs, Robby. Merry Christmas. We'll get together again, you know. Some strange way. Maybe we'll make a movie together. Black and white. - Sabrina, this one's for you. - Thank you. - See you around. - What, no bon voyage? I'll see you back. And, little Princess Smiling Face, this one's for you... from Chief Mojo Rising. Happy Birthday, Princess. - Let me see. - It's you. Forever young. The strangest life I've ever known. Jim, got a plane to catch, man? Yeah. We're reaching for death on the end of a candle. We're trying for something that's already found us. Last words. Out. Did you get all that? Yeah. I got it, Jim. Come on. Let's get some tacos. Death. It's not so bad. Love my girl. Jim? Jim, is that you? I knew it was you, Jim Morrison. I always know when it's you. - Come on, baby, get out of the tub. - Come on, Mama'll dry you off. Just stop joking around, now, you hear me? Just cut it out. Was it all right, Jim? Did you enjoy it when it came? Just like you said you would. They are waiting to take us into the severed garden. Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death on a strange hour unannounced, unplanned for, like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed? Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws. No more money, no more fancy dress. This other kingdom seems by far the best. Until its other jaw reveals incest. And loose obedience to a vegetable law. I will not go.
