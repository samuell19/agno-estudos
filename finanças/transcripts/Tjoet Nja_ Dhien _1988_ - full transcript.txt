After they destroyed Lampadang, my home village, they burnt Lampisang too. It reminds me of the time... ...when General Van Swieten burnt the Kutaraja Mosque in 1873. And since that time, the land of Aceh has been stained by the greed of men who never understood... ...how deep is our love for this beneficent land. Today, our retreat expresses my belief: ...our struggle against the Colonialists... ...is part of the true faith. Dear Teuku, your decision to rise up again and to drive the infidels out of our beloved land... ...brings me invaluable happiness. And though I am in a place so different from our house in Lampisang, I am thankful. For all the people here around me... recognize the value of fighting for one's faith. What is it, Tjoet Nja'? Don't be too long. Take this message for my husband Teuku. Go to the 5 kilometer post and ask our man there to pass it to the next post. Teuku, what do you intend to do? What are you waiting for? I can't go back to Lampisang. We have to act before it's too late. I hear that Van Heutsz is coming with thousands of troops. I've never been afraid of that. My concern is that, now, in the face of the enemy, we are divided. It will be different if you're back with guns to fight the Dutch. It's been a long time, Teuku, that I've awaited this. We should be thankful. I beg of you, do not ask me to live among the infidels again. Not for any reason! Dear husband, three years were more than enough. You still doubt me. That was a subterfuge! How else could we have armed ourselves? For all this time, I could study Dutch military strategy. So you must help me. Send word to every village tomorrow, before the first prayer, I will be in the foot of the hill. Whoever will give their life for the cause, I will be waiting for them. God is great! God is great! Tonight... ...you are offering yourselves in martyrdom together with me! -God is great! -God is great! Pang Laot, burn everything! Kill the officers! It's really going too far. This is unbelievable! Don't you understand, what's expected of you? Gentlemen, starting today we forget the concentration line strategy. We adopt a new policy. We will search every village... and arrest anyone who looks suspicious. And one more thing. For the time being, no night patrols. Gentlemen, this Umar, his wife Dhien, and his rebels, we'll only attack them during the day. Afterwards, when Van Heutsz and his special forces arrive we will resume our night patrols. With the hope that we will have results. Any questions? Yes, General. If the villagers fight back, can we apply the scorched earth tactics? Gentlemen, I give you carte blanche. The important thing is to capture Umar and Dhien. Dead or alive! Is that clear? This is your last chance. Where is Umar? Where is Umar? Pig-headed. Eh! Where is Umar?! God damn it, stubborn bastards! Wipe him out! Take your positions. Aim your rifle! God is great. Shoot! To our work together! To your success, Lieutenant Colonel Van Heutsz. -Mr. Leubeh. -Thank you, it's enough. -Remarkable stuff! -Please, take a seat. I've never had wine as good as this. Mr. Van Heutsz, is this French Wine? No. -Italian? -No. Russian? No, Mr. Leubeh. In Russian, people only drink vodka. This outstanding wine comes from the Netherlands. The Netherlands are known for the cheese! And what is Aceh known for? Its coffee. Its excellent coffee. No, Mr. Leubeh. It's known for its double-dealing. Mr. Leubeh. Let's get back to reality. What do you have to report? I'm sure you have news for me. I always bring you the best information. And this time it's very special. This damned is trying to be a hero before the Dutch Queen. He's murdered some of my best men. Let him go on killing! Does he think he'll overcome the Acehness this way? These infidels are dreaming. They think they can kill Aceh as a nation. That's what I used to think. But that general is crafty. And he has Leubeh helping him. Why waste your time hating him? Sometimes I even feel sorry for him. Gambang, take this. Gambang, sit down. What is it, father? How old are you now? I don't want to get married. Who's talking about getting married? I just want to know your feelings. I want to talk to you about important things. First of all I urge you to remain constant in your faith. For the piety of the children lays a path to heaven for their parents. Second, I've always hoped you'd become like your mother. And finally, I like that young man. What's his name? Teuku Mayet, from the village of Tiro. So, that's enough, you two should rest. Tomorrow, at dawn, I will leave. All of you, be ready! We have been separated from our loved ones. Thanks to the Dutch and their colonisation of our land, we have lost our freedom. We have lost all we own, our farmlands, and now we stand to lose our lives. How then can we bring up our children? We must instil in them the spirit of Holy War. We must teach them to defend our land... ...and continue our struggle. Let us hope, if we die as martyrs, they will rise and fight in the name of God. We must live as brothers or die as martyrs. May Allah turn evil into good. Tjoet Nja', when can I join the fight? Glory be to God. Pray that the war will be over when you grow up. There is only one choice... ...that infidel general or I, one of us will be buried here! We must take back Meulaboh! Gentlemen, Leubeh's information was correct. You'll leave tonight with twelve of your best marksmen. You know what to do! The target is Teuku Umar. The rest is up to you. Leubeh says it'll take a golden bullet to kill him. Of course, that golden bullet... Don't ask how and why... just get it tonight! Disperse! And keep your cover! Don't forget, the target is Umar. Take your positions. You too, at the back. Shoot! Tjoet Nja'... Stop crying, my child. Allah is great. Gambang... Calm down. Your father died as a martyr. Gambang, as an Acehnese woman, you mustn't weep for one who dies in battle. Be strong... so that your father's soul may rest in peace. This is not the end of our struggle. And it is our duty to carry it on. He's Leubeh's accomplice. -Have mercy, Tjoet Nja'. -Shameful! Pang Laot, I leave it to you. He is yours now! Nja' Bantu. We will leave at dawn. Go with Pang Karim. Tell Pang Daud to attack from the east! Pang Laot, let's not waste time. Yes, Tjoet Nja'. Quick! Take what you need! Don't get up. Were you sleeping out there? What on earth happened? How can Dhien get in an out of a village without you knowing? Inconceivable! Several villages were searched. Surveillance was tightened. Every time the bird has already flown. Tightened? And this is the result? It's always the same with you. May I make a suggestion? A suggestion? I get sick of your suggestions. No, Voorneman, I don't need it. I thought that with the death of Umar, the war would end. What do you think, Mr. Leubeh? We leave tonight! -Pack it all! -I told you already, General. This woman was Umar's wife. She is dangerous. Don't forget. She's the daughter of Teuku Nanta Setia. General Van Swieten's enemy. Her first husband, Ibrahim Lamnga, was a warrior too. I've told all this to you before but you don't believe me. In fact, in my opinion, she was the brains behind Umar. Anyone else? Bring him here! Where is Tjoet Nja' Dhien? You have three seconds to tell me. Still being stubborn. This is your last warning. If you don't talk you'll suffer the consequences. Is that clear? Whoever knows, stand up! It's your choice. Burn the place to the ground. I've had enough of it. We must hit back right away. It is not that simple. They have arms, power, and money. They have everything, but a sense of shame. Get used to being patient. We must see through the darkness, and be unseen in the light. Remember that nature is our best ally. Here will be our battlefield. They've brought in crack-troops used to fighting in the jungle of Java. So? They are merely mercenaries. They are the most cruel. They kill without mercy. That's what I say, it all depends on weapons, power and money. Look into this. The Dutch have strengthened their hold over the area. Beutong Lhee Sagoe, Meulaboh, Pidie, Geumpang. We'll move from one place to the next. If needed, as far as Bireuen and Takengon. Pang Laot, I will go to Meulaboh myself. Tjoet Nja', that's impossible. I am responsible for your safety. My hair is turning grey, that's true. But you are worried because I am a woman. Meulaboh is very dangerous. The Dutch are everywhere. That's all the better. They will rather look at pretty girls than at an old woman like me. I must take advantage of the situation. That's what I mean by seeing through the darkness and being unseen in the light. Here's Lhee Sagoe, Beutong. Surrounded by mountains, difficult to reach. Voorneman, I want you to block Beutong. Make sure no one can go in or out. I don't care how you do it, understand? Who is speaking? Mrs. Van Heutsz. Can I talk to my husband? -Siti, get the water ready. -Yes, madam. Who? With me. Are you coming home tonight? I've been expecting you. No, I can't come. Why didn't you send a word? Didn't you get my letter? No, not a word. And tomorrow we have visitors! I have important things to do here. What will we do? We promised to play bridge here tomorrow. But tomorrow I'll be there. Well, don't be too late then! Women... I tell you, Voorneman. If you ever become a general, don't get married. Women are a headache. I am not a General yet. Fortunately! You must be more careful. Start rotating the food supplies from one village to another. That is indeed what we are doing, Tjoet Nja'. Take this, you will need it. Praise God. You have to stay here with the cook. If anything happens to us, you are here to carry on. You and mother think I'm a child. Gambang... Learn from experience. What we need for this fight is a clear mind. I'm the only one who knows where to get the money. We each have our own duty. Pang Laot will attack from the east. I'll go in from the west. Don't let me bother you. I'm most grateful for your help. Especially that your grandson will accompany me. We are very much honoured. To have our grandson go with you to Meulaboh is a blessing to us. I've arranged a travel document for you. Lately... the Dutch have been registering everyone. We have to report once a month. Getting into Meulaboh won't be easy. You should be more careful. Take this document with you. Thank God. Nja' Bantu, as soon as the baby come's back, you return to camp. I must go now. Let us hope things go well. Pray for me. I want to send supplies to the foothill. Have your people ready to take them. -All is ready, Tjoet Nja'. -That's fine. Praise the Lord. What is this? I want a thorough check! Stop everyone and check their documents! Show me your pass. What are you hiding there? Daggers! What are they for? Are you one of the rebels? Arrest him! That one too! Arrest every man who looks strong! Quick! I didn't think you could get into Meulaboh. What's so difficult, Habib? All they have is my name, but who knows my face? Don't forget, Leubeh has many spies. His nose and ears are everywhere. I heard he's here somewhere. Let's forget him. Drink up first. We have something special for you. Your favourite food, Kerling fish. -Prepare it, please. -Yes. Now the important thing. How did you get so much? That's the Acehnese. Once they've agreed they'd pawn their own graves. This is nothing. Praise the Lord. Just as long as they don't pawn their dignity. How about the other things I ordered? The supplies and food, I have taken care of. Every two weeks, I'll send someone to fetch them. Good. You can have the first lot on the next full moon. About that Portuguese merchant, he's ready to meet you anytime. He'll drive a stiff bargain. I know how to handle him. There is one question you haven't answered... Teuku Leubeh... Forget him. He's a waste of time. That bastard is too well-guarded. Habib... Leubeh? To kill a traitor is easy. But, Tjoet Nja', it won't put an end to treachery. Alright. What I know is that next week, Teuku Leubeh will go to Kutaraja. Don't worry, sir. What guarantee do you want? Very good. If you have told me the truth, come with me tonight. If Tjoet Nja' Dhien is there, you'll have a lot of money. But if not... You know the risk. Everyone inside. Hurry! Search the house! May the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be with you. Mr. Habib Meulaboh. What is wrong? What is the matter? This time, you can't fool me. -I don't understand. -Come on, Habib. We know each other. You know why I'm here. For Tjoet Nja' Dhien! You are in the wrong place, sir. Then who are they? This is my wife, this is my daughter. Have they done wrong? He is lying, sir! Don't trust him. Believe me, I saw her with my own eyes! -Get out, all of you! -Believe me, she is here, sir. Sir! Habib Meulaboh... I'm sorry to have troubled you. Good evening. Sir! Lieutenant, wait! Sir! For that amount, I can only give you... ...forty rifles. I need to have... ...sixty. You can't count that way. What about the risks I'm taking? And the money I have to give to certain officials? Who is it? Don't be alarmed. They're just coming for this. Tell your Commander, the other half next week. Tjoet Nja'? What's all this about? I'm being careful. How long have you known me? Lately, many people have changed. Why would I betray you? Your uprising is a gold mine for people like me. I know that. The Dutch officers will be happy to have extra funds. You are right. All this is politics. If the rebellion ends, the government will put an end to their enormous budget. Some officers have just asked me to take care of their families, because soon they must follow Van Heutsz. Why so many men? Of course, because of money. Prestige...and self-satisfaction. Money and glory. While you're fighting for your country... ...they're fighting for better income. The world is full of games. Money, money, it's only money. Look at these people. Dutch or Acehnese, they all betray for money. And how about you? Remember, I'm a merchant. Where the money lies, there is my homeland. If a rich merchant claims to be fighting for his country... ...it's a big lie. I hate hypocrites. And how about people who lie, to make a bigger profit? Tjoet Nja', I know what you're up to. How many did you say? Sixty. Sixty... How about if I make it... sixty one? Take your positions. Spread out! Wait for my order. Pang Karim. Let me remind you, I'll take care of Leubeh! When we get to Kutaraja I'll promote you all. Seize their weapons! Take what we need. Pang Karim. What kind of nobleman are you? Shame on you! # Children of this country, arise # # The Holy war is calling us # To fight the infidels is our sacred duty... Who is he, Pang Laot? I call him "Poet". We met on the way back from the east. He's very clever. He talks a lot about you. I like his poems. He admires you too. I'm sure you don't know the value of time. Look. With each movement of the clock hands the world grows older. And those who can't move with it are losers. Time leaves them behind. How about you? My best friend here keeps faithful watch over me. So that I do not become a loser. Gambang. Leave him alone. It's fun to hear him, his head is always in the clouds. You better give me a hand. Have this washing done. Poet, what are you doing here? What did I do? Poet... Poet, give me a hand. What is it, Tjoet Nja'? Give this food to our men. And remind Mudin to go to the foothill tonight. Tjoet Nja'. We only have supply for a week. We have to find more. Leave it to me. I know every dish prepared in the region. You know where to cook? In the kitchen, not in the clouds. Not in dreams! That's enough... Stop arguing. We all have our responsibilities. You Poet... ...are time. The food I want from you is your poem of our journey. But, if you feel like cooking... that's fine too. Let the others look for food. Allow me to look for it in Takengon. Be careful. I've heard Van Daalen is heading that way. Good heavens! Why did you let the rice burn? Poet told me not to touch it. -You listened to him? -I thought he'd be angry. Idiot... Give me some leaves, quick! Do you know where Poet is? On the hill. Ahmad, come here! Poet...poet! Poet! What kind of food is this? Acehnese food is never burnt. -What? -Look! God! Where's my friend? It's dead! Traitor! The world is full of traitors! How could it happen? -My watch is dead. -What's that now? My best friend left me. To hell with your friend. I'm counting grains of rice with my hand. You're wasting them with your dreams. Eat all this! Why did you leave me? You promised to be faithful. The rice is burnt, I must take the blame. What have I done wrong? O Lord, when shall I reach perfection? You have to rest, Tjoet Nja'. Your legs are too weak. Forget the Dutch for a moment. How can I? We are strong enough. Now that Ali Baet, Habib Panjang and the others... ...are united with more than three hundred men. And we have fifty men as reinforcements. Still the infidels are stronger. But our spirit is greater! You are getting clever, Gambang. Would you leave us alone? You're a grown-up woman now. Let me see your hand. It's so smooth, as smooth as my hands were when I was a girl. This hand will one day stroke your husband and children. To help them get sleep. And this hand will wake them up to enable them to see the world's new day. Gambang... you must remind them. To watch over our land, to guard and defend it. Even at the cost of their lives. Remember that, Gambang. You should rest, Mother. It's time for you to think about a husband. Or maybe it's just my longing for a grandchild. You have married me to the struggle. A family and the struggle, both are necessary. That is the essence of our inheritance. What is it, Mother? I'm just an ordinary woman. Your father... # Little child, poor little child # # I can hear you cry of hunger # # There is food in the shop # # But your mother has no money # # Even so, don't shed your tears # # For even when they touch the ground # # The world won't feel your sorrow # # But I do, little child # Poet, why are you so sad? What is it? It's the second time in my life that I've been sad. The first time was when my friend Kadir left me forever. Who was Kadir? A donkey. Are you joking? No one ever understands. People always think donkeys are stupid. But throughout my life I've met men who are more stupid than donkeys. It's hard for you to believe that I choose donkeys as best friends. People do betray you, especially these days. People eat people. A donkey just eats grass. And Kadir never betrayed me. That is a true friend. Here, take it. You can keep it forever. Or give it to your mother. Open it. Now, it's beautiful tune is gone. Time, my best friend, has gone forever. Look at its clock hands, Gambang. It'll never move again. It's dead, and I'm so afraid that the Time will leave me behind. A man as wise and bright as you, willing to rely on a machine. -What did you say? -"Rely". You rely on a machine. In your poems, you always say that man is the machine that moves life. Not the opposite. Well, you're right. To hell with machines! We still have the sun. We still have the rain. The forest, the wind. We still have the mountains. We still have the sun. We still have the rain. We still have the water. We still have the nature. Tjoet Nja'... Each second this land is washed in the blood of innocents. It happened to our brothers in the land of Gayo. I saw that massacre with my own eyes. I wrote this whole tragedy in the book of my life... ...so that one day the world will see. That in fact the money, weapons, and power of the infidels... ...mean very little to humanity. Many of the men are ill and many died as martyrs. But I also bring good news. Captain Campioni and the 9th brigade are annihilated. Campioni himself is dead. O God the Almighty. I seek forgiveness in God. All we do is kill each other. What is the meaning of all this? It pains me to see a person proud of someone's death. -That's what the Dutch wanted. -Don't talk like that. They're not all as cruel as Van Daalen. And the soldiers are only tools. Behind all this is a handful of greedy people. How much food do we have left, Nja' Bantu? We are running out. The Dutch burnt the rice barns. They control access to all the villages. They have taken everything we own. Let me remind you of one thing... Faith is our fight. Remember that. Poet, where is the boy you brought back? He is with Pang Karim. You mustn't worry about me. Agam, eat up! To grow up, you have to eat. So you can be strong as Pang Karim. Look at him, you'll be strong as him. Then you can kill the infidels. Eat up, kid, to be strong like me! You will cut a path to and from the camp. Tjoet Nja' wants it. Do the best you can. Look at this, Tjoet Nja'. What is it? I can't see very well. A mosquito, I just killed it. Only because he took a little blood from you? The morning mosquitoes are special. It's easy to kill them. It is more difficult to kill what makes no sound and doesn't bite. But could kill us all. What do you mean? Can't you smell something rotten around us? Isn't it from a dead animal? If it were, everyone could smell it. What we face is much worse. Lately... I've been smelling something rotten coming from someone's heart. Tjoet Nja', you're extraordinary. Your feelings touch things. Your thoughts see. Your confidence makes you move. Since I came across many burnt villages all around this camp... ...I caught a whiff of that stench. But the wind is strong and the smell is swift: it suddenly disappears. The traitor hides behind a veil of innocence. It is difficult to catch. It's not as easy as to kill this mosquito. The infidels are coming. Get Tjoet Nja' to safety. They are at the foot of the hill. Many of them. You go north with Pang Daud. Pang Bintang, go to south direction. Mudin, Ramli, come with me! Forward! Move forwards! Who's responsible for this? So this is your work?! Stupid donkey! I don't understand... What is a traitor's heart made of? While we are in such a situation... What does he want from me? It happens again and again. All of our defeats have been caused by treachery of our own people. Lord! Pang Laot. Don't feel so guilty. This wouldn't have happened if one of us had not betrayed us. Ask in your hearts! I have an intuition... Don't try to hide behind my clouded eyes. My heart and my feelings are not blind. I am sure that the traitor is among us... here! Tjoet Nja'! -Go back to your place. -Forgive me Tjoet Nja'. I have nothing left. The heathens bought me. I beg your forgiveness. -I have sinned. -Enough, Fatma! They promised to return my husband... and children once they got you. Save me from my sin. I'm ready to die by your hand. Deliver me! Why did you do that, Nja' Bantu? Forgive me, Tjoet Nja'. Give her a decent burial. Is that all you have? Stop it, Poet, you're giving me a headache! What now? We can't eat your poems. I'd like to see if you'd still sing without food. Look! This is all we have. Bananas... I've seen people eat stones. And even diamonds, rice-fields, mountains. You don't know it! Eat all that! I'd rather eat bananas. God, open her eyes. Poet, I go with you. Agam. You want to kill infidels? Learn to use a sword. Pang Laot, don't lie to him. How could your sword destroy the infidels? Look at us now! That's the difference between us. Agam. With my poems, I will drive the Infidels out of Aceh! Pang Laot. I don't need a sword. All I need is this... This... This... You might be right, Poet, but your poems also put many people to sleep. So, Agam? I'm coming with you, Pang Laot. You're lying to him again. And you're deceiving me. Watch... Hold this. Not like that! How could you have strength? Straighten your arm. Stand there and watch. Center your strength in your wrist. Watch! Agam... As a son of Aceh... ...you should own this. If anyone betrays our country... ...you will use this, will you? Pang Laot... ...this is my request: take care of them. Especially of their health. Don't worry about me! Eat your poems. -This food is not for you. -As if I couldn't help myself! Bantu. Nja' Bantu. My eyes... What is it, Mother? Gambang... None of us can get her... ...to soften her stance. Even though her strength is draining away, in front of the enemy, each day in greater numbers. We are powerless. We have nothing left. My few surviving soldiers are exhausted. Until they find and kill Tjoet Nja'... ...they will keep on chasing us. One day, we will be tired. But they will keep on coming. Pang Laot. Don't give up yet. I have an idea. Remember, when we attacked the Dutch... ...they thought Tjoet was in the battle. Even thought it was me. Pang Laot... Tjoet Nja' must live! What are you planning to do? Move back! Move back! Leave me by myself! Move back! I don't like this game! How dare you play with my feelings! I am not a child. What are you afraid of? Who told you to hide this from me? Are you keeping another secret? Pang Laot... You should know what Nja' Bantu meant to me. Careful, Tjoet Nja'. I'm fine, Agam. -Always remember that, Gambang. -I'm sorry, Mother. I'm worried about your mother's health. What do you want? She can be treated only in Kutaraja. Try to persuade her to go there. Pang Laot, I know my mother. Forget this. Gambang, sooner or later, the Dutch will be here. So what? Voorneman, I have some bad news for you. Will you read this report? You'll see that the victory was declared too early. How the hell is it possible? That's what I was going to ask you. -We had all the evidence! -The evidence, of course! Evidence that anyone can find. Come on, Captain! Even you were convinced! I did ask you if you were certain that the evidence was authentic. Vastenou and Van Vuuren were 100 percent sure. Let's not mention names. Van Vuuren and Vastenou are not present. The facts, Voorneman. This is the result of the investigation by our experts. The reality is harsh! Dhien is alive. She is in the Beutong woods. So, I'm to blame for the whole thing? I'm not the only officer here. It isn't necessary to talk any further. I spoke with Van Vuuren. He will resume the patrols. And concerning you, Voorneman? You have direct orders from general Van Heutsz. So I guess you know what you have to do. We shall see. Pang Laot, the Dutch... They have crossed the river! Pang Karim, head them off! Get ready. Take Tjoet Nja' to the west! To that direction! There's only one way out, Tjoet Nja'. And that's up. They must have surrounded the whole area. Put Tjoet Nja' down. A young officer is leading them. Go, and keep your eyes open! Quick! There are many of them. With a young officer. We'd better avoid them. We'll cut them off from above. Order the men to surround them! -Pang Laot... -Yes, Tjoet Nja'. I want that officer alive. Don't shoot that officer! Take him. Bandage his wound. Don't be frightened, young man. If I wanted to kill you, it would have been easy. But such is not our intention. What do your people want from me? You should be ashamed of soiling my country. Tell that to your chiefs. Now you can go, young man. Quick! Before I change my mind. All you say is you don't know where Dhien is hiding! You coward! You are afraid of a woman! You, an officer. Stupid bastard! You shame the name of our company! People like you disgust me. You know what, you are a traitor, you'll end up in front of the firing squad. It's your head, you understand, you moron! Voorneman! You'll never succeed that way. You want to take over? Those manners! What are you doing here? Scram! Relax, boy. I feel sorry for you. But don't forget, we are soldiers. That means carrying out orders. Orders from superiors. Believe me. It's not always pleasant. In the military... ...we can't always do things the way we want. Frankly, between you and me, all this is ridiculous. Where did it take place this meeting with Tjoet Nja' Dhien? Take it easy. So, what did he say? He needs a rest. We can continue tomorrow. Waste of time! Tomorrow, ha! You are wasting my time. God, what is happening? This is what a traitor deserves. Have you lost your mind? How will you justify this to yourself? What about your idea of war? This whole thing... ...has become an obsession. -You make it a personal war. -A personal war? I had no choice. If this gets known outside it will have serious consequences for all of us. I know that. I admit you will get results. But what results! Voorneman, this way you'll never triumph over Tjoet Nja' Dhien. Not as a soldier, certainly not as a man. You talk like the bureaucrats! I'm here in the field, I know what I must do. Lieutenant... In your report to Kutaraja, you will write... ...that the platoon behaved heroically... ...and died in an ambush. The location is up to you. What is it, Pang Laot? May I speak sincerely? I do not understand... ...what we have been looking for. Why do you say that? I don't know anymore. What we are fighting against. Our situation is getting worse. -Soon, we'll be paralysed. -I do not care. As long as our souls are not paralysed. We have nothing left. We won't have the strength. Pang Laot! Nothing ever forced you to stay at my side! Tjoet Nja'... Come back to earth. The Dutch have surrounded us, they are everywhere in these woods. To hell with the Dutch! I'm only afraid of the weakening faith in those around me. My faith is not weakening. But I worry about you. Your health is failing. What do you want? To surrender to the Dutch? Don't ever dream that I could do that. Remember, this war is a battle against the weakening of the faith. Always bear this in mind. -Wood for Tjoet Nja'. -Agam... Stop a moment. Agam. Look over there. There are many infidels there. I'll go there and kill them. Take care of Tjoet Nja'. Don't let her leave this place. And don't tell anyone, especially the Poet. You love Tjoet Nja', don't you? All right. Take care of her until I come back. Pang Laot, when are you coming back? Pang Laot. It often happens that the situation decides for us what we have to undertake. It requires a very deep conscience. Pang Laot. History will tell our nation... ...the decisions that we will make. The choice today is in your hands. You understand... ...that I am in a position... ...that I can also... ...take such decisions. Pang Laot. I give you my word as an officer. Tell me... ...your conditions. Captain, so that you know... ...here are my conditions: First, once Tjoet Nja' is in your hands... ...treat her in a manner fitting her status as a leader. Furthermore, I respectfully request that you commit yourself to this: never to separate her from the land and the people of Aceh. I do not want to hear... that, one day, she has been exiled. That's all, Captain. I myself ask for nothing. Pang Laot has betrayed! Shame, Pang Laot. This is our greatest defeat. Pang Karim! Leave everything behind. Let's go to the West! Agam! Pang Karim! We'll stop here. Give the order to stand ready. That traitor will come sooner or later. Yes, Tjoet Nja'. Pang Daud, pick a spot and built hut for Tjoet Nja'. Quick! Tjoet Nja'! Pang Laot is coming with the infidels. So, you knew better. What Pang Laot has done mustn't happen again. Weakening faith is the worst of our enemies. If there is anyone else whose faith is failing, I will let them go right away! For those who want to stay with me, there is only one choice: death in the way of the Lord. In the way of the Lord. Let me stay, Mother. Gambang. This is not a place for you. I want to die with you. Your time hasn't come. There are other things you must do. Go to the Tiro family, and let them know. I will wait for the traitor. You must leave me here, Gambang. Allow me to die with your men, Mother. Gambang, go with the Poet. This is my order as your mother and your leader. Are you out of your mind? Pang Laot! Quiet now. No panic. Agam, where are the others? Traitor! Do not touch me! Filthy infidel! Poet, raise up the people of Aceh, sing your final poem. God... Stop the shooting! Stop it! One more. Aim... Shoot! They are martyrs. Martyrs never die. They live at the side of the Lord. They are doing it for Tjoet Nja'. Agam. You love Tjoet Nja'. Help me. We must save her. Help me, Agam. They have promised to help her, to cure her. Pang Laot, everything all right? Give the boy my coat. That's not necessary. Agam. Do you know where Tjoet Nja' is? Glory be to God. I'm sorry. My duty as an officer. I'm Captain Veltman. I have been ordered... It is my duty to carry out that order. Tjoet Nja', I am sorry. Sorry that... That I... Can you hear me? I must take you with me. Agam... ...wait here. Forgive me, Tjoet Nja'. Your health... ...forced me to do this. Believe me. They promised to take care of you the best way possible. Do not be mistaken. I can't watch you dying this way. Your health... Traitor! You failed to see! After so many years with me. You should be ashamed! This is your greatest defeat, Pang Laot. You are a disgrace to our people. You've never understood! Well, Voorneman, this is what we have come to. Van Vuuren, prepare to leave as soon as possible. When you grow up, never betray your country. Let me go! Let me go! Wait! Leave him be. Show her respect.
