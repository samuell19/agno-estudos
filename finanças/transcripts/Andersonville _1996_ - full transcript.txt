[♪♪♪] [GUNFIRE] A skirmish is taking advance. Commence firing! Hold up! Josie, go tell the captain there's just a few of them left. I think we can swing around and drive them right into his arms. Yeah. In five minutes, unless he tells us no. Ready! Aim! Fire! Load! Fire by file. Commence firing. Sir, Sergeant says there's just a few of them. We can drive them into you in five minutes. Unless you tell him not to. I don't know there's any such a few of them. Did you see any on your way over? No, sir. Did you see any cavalry? No, sir. You know Jimmy McSpadden, sir. If he says he'll drive 'em, he'll drive 'em. You tell him to drive around. Sir. As long as there's no cavalry. Leave it there! Hey, boys. Cousin Josie, are you hurt? No. Are you? How are you, Sergeant? I'll live. Just a scratch. Not such a few of them as I thought, huh? Sorry, lads. I should have known there were horses about. This war is making me deaf and blind. Is that James? And Benjamin too. My respects, captain. If you'll detail two of your men, I know you'll want to bury your dead. I thank you, sir. You'll be staying here tonight and moving on in the morning. You got rations and blankets for your men? Our haversacks are over there, sir. Have them brought over. Yes, sir. Jeremiah. You all lie flat on the ground. Nobody stand. Nobody move till morning. Cousin... Did you ever think... No. I never did. What do we do? Pick our time, make a run for it. Now. They're all watching. But it's night. Once you're in their prison camps, they've got you good. You heard the stories? Here's what. I'm going to stand up real slow... You can't stand up. And I'm going to say I have to relieve myself. They'll send a guard with me. I've got a knife in my pocket. When they hear and they come after me, you run for it. You run like the devil. That farm with the smokehouse we passed this morning, looks like Uncle John's? Yeah. I'll meet you there soon. Who'll look after the sergeant? Don't worry. Just give my love to the ladies in Boston. We will, sergeant. Ready? Yeah. Listen, I've got to re... [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Billy! Told you. Nobody stands, nobody moves around. Stay, Josie. [HARMONICA PLAYING] Nineteen Massachusetts? Second Wisconsin. You were on our left second day at Gettysburg. I remember. They couldn't move you. They tried hard, though. They were on Cemetery Ridge. Gave that place its rightful name. When did they get you boys? Yesterday. Back there. Do you know where they're taking us? They won't tell us anything. I know they're not taking us to Veracruz to fight Santa Anna, huh? [CHUCKLES] Your attention, gentlemen. Now, here's the situation, boys... How are you faring, Billy? You're going to be here a spell... Last night... so might as well make yourselves at home. Just stretch out on the ground, but stay in this area. We have supplies coming, but dispatch didn't say when, so it may not be until after dark, even. Some of your fellows tore up a tract just north of here. Until then, just rest easy. I know some of you haven't eaten today. We're sorry, but we don't have anything here, for you or for us, but anyway... Come over and stay with me and the sergeant. Billy... Yes. I'm going to need your help with him. Okay? Okay. Till then, just, uh... please be patient, all right? [GRUNTING] Are you writing Bob's wife? Yeah. Right. Well, when you finish with that one, would you mind writing one for me? Sure. 'Fraid I never did learn my letters. What's it like being so educated? I'm just an apprentice. You just realize how much it is you don't know. [CHUCKLES] Well, in that case, I should be a writing fool. Go on, write your letter. I don't mean to be bothering you. My father's a printer. He taught me. My mother always read to me while I was growing up. Ah. My mother will have to go to the priest to read what we send her. I don't think she's ever got a letter in her life. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] Everybody up. Get a move on. Get up. Get on your feet. Officers. Over here, please. This train's not for you. On your feet, now. I said get up. Let's go, let's go, Massachusetts, Stay together. Sgt. McSpadden. Cpl. Day. Capt. Russell. How are you, sergeant? How's the, uh... Never better, sir. I just wanted you both to know you've always been good soldiers, always did what had to be done. Uh, captain? Bob's wife's address is on this. You may have an easier time getting it sent than I would. Where you're going, you take care of the boys, now. Yes, sir. Don't you worry, captain. I just hate like the devil having to leave them. We've been through a lot together. You're in charge now. You do what you can for them. And something happens to the sergeant, you'll be in command. I'll do my best, sir. I know you will. God bless you, boys. Go on, y'all. Get in the car now. I'll mail your letter. We'll see you in Boston, captain, and you can bet it'll be a bright, sunshiny day. Come on. Push them in the back. Let's go. Let's get going. Come on. Let's go. [♪♪♪] No, no, I don't think so. [YELLING] Come on, now. [YELLING] Get ahold of yourself. Sir. Let's get a blanket in here. By the left, company. March. [DRUMS BEATING AND FLUTE PLAYING] [DOGS BARKING] Come on. Pick up your feet. Are you deaf, boy? Move it. Move it. Come on, now, hurry it up. Whoa. Hold on there, Yankees. Caught us a couple of runaways, captain. Sweet Jesus. Come on, now. Let's go, you Yankees. Come on, now. Now, halt. Teach you to run. All right. Come on. Open the gate. And what do you call this little piece of heaven? This? This is Andersonville. All right, now, let's get a move on. Come on. Move, move. Get in there. Let's go, you damn Yankee swine. Move it. What the hell are you waitin' on, boy? Move it on, you dirty Yanks. Come on, move it, move it. Get in there. I'm sick of looking at you. Hey, take a look at that. Where are you from? Any word about the exchange? Anybody from Virginia? What do you hear? Anybody from Delaware? Hey, where did you boys get captured? Anybody have something to eat? Indiana? Anybody here? Nice fresh fish. How about the Sixth, Ohio? [CHUCKLING] Fresh fish. Fresh fish. Give it here! Move. Fresh fish. Move. Hey, hey, fresh fish. Welcome to Andersonville. Fine looking place, don't you think? For a hog pen, maybe. Hey, where'd youse get catched at? Cold Harbor. Well, that's good. It means Grant's going forward, Bobby Lee's going back. Let me show youse around, get you a good place to stay. You want to be up by the wall, away from the swamp. Yeah, it don't stink so bad there, and there ain't so many bugs... People neither. You need to shave. Come on, friend. I'll show you where you can shave. Hold it, hold it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Munn, leave them alone. You stay away from them. Munn, you leave them alone! Get away! I know what kind of man you are, and you just stay away from these men. Let the fish go. We'll roast them another time. Don't waste your time with that bunch. Come back with your pards. And you know who they are, don't you, Mick? We'll take care of you later. Those are the Raiders. Hyenas is more like it, and you stay away from them. What they do is, they try to steer the new boys over there and whack you over the head, kill you even, try to take your stuff from you. Very much obliged, friend. Yeah. Thank you. Friend? You don't... you don't know who I am? Sarge? Jo... Josiah? Now, old Dick. Now, I signed up with you, young man, and I fought with all of you at Seven Pines and Chickamauga and Antietam. Dick Potter? Yeah, it's... Oh, my God, is that you? Oh, my God! It's Dick Potter. There's no food in here, and somebody stole my uniform right off my back. You look fine, there, Dick. Thank you, Tucker. We thought you were killed two years ago. We thought they got you at Antietam. No, I weren't killed at all. They shot me in both my legs, but I survived. I'll be damned. You're surprised to see me, huh, Josie? Oh, my God. When are we going fishing again? We're going fishing again, don't you worry. Dick and his father are the best fishermen in New Bedford. Yeah, that's saying a lot. God, I can't believe it. It's good to see you boys. Listen, we've got to stay away from these Raiders. Let's head up over here. Why doesn't somebody stop 'em? They run the place, sarge. They? What do you mean they run the place? What about the Rebs? Why don't they stop them? Stop them? Hell, they trade with them. Whiskey, food, rations. Whatever they need, guards give 'em. The 7th Vermont was in here, took their coats, shoes, blankets, all their rations. Oh, Jesus. Cold nights then. The boys didn't have a chance. They didn't last a week. And they're on our side, you say? Bounty jumpers. Crawled out of the sewers in New York or wherever for the joining-up money. Most of them thought they'd run off before they'd see any fighting. [DRUM BEATING] So I ask you again... where is my bridle and halter? What? You don't care? No rations today unless the goddamn thief returns what he stole from me. If you are digging tunnels, you will suffer the consequences. Tunnels are useless! Even if you are outside, I give any two men a 12-hour start, and then track you with the dogs, and you will suffer the consequences. But why bother anyway? I know absolutely there are talks going on this moment for exchange. Any day now, all of you will be paroled in quick order. So we understand each other. No bridle! No halter! No rations! [CROWD PROTESTING] You Yankees! You go about your own business now if you know what's good for you. They're going to starve us to death over a stinkin' bridle! Wirz is a goddamn liar! Wirz isn't going to give us anything. We've been through the mill already. You boys didn't hear anything about any sort of prisoner exchange, did you, sarge? No. No? Damn Wirz. Tells that to all the new boys so they don't go and try and run off. Dick! [COUGHS] You all right? You haven't eaten today? No, I... I didn't eat yesterday, either. Oh, somebody stole the damn bridle off his carthorse, and Wirz is punishing the whole camp. Here. What is that, salt pork? Yeah. Oh, my God. I ain't seen salt pork since I been in here. Rebs gave it to us before they put us on the train. Oh, I don't want it if the Rebs... Dick, come on. Go ahead. Eat. God bless you. Oh, wow. Have this here onion, Dick. An onion? I forgot what an onion tastes like. Anybody got anything else? Good? It's a meal fit for a king. I feel much better. Thanks. God bless you. Well, do you boys want to take a walk around and see your new home? Yeah. Guess so. Sure. All right, help me up. Caught these boys trying to escape. How long have they been in that thing? Since the day they caught them. Dick, is there a surgeon around here? Look, the sergeant took a bullet in the shoulder. Sarge, I can take you down to sick hall if you want. I'm fine, Dick. I'm fine. It won't do you much good. I'm going to show you where we ain't going fishing, Josiah. [FLIES BUZZING] They built this whole place downstream from their tents, horses, dogs, everything, so they do whatever they do in the water even before it gets down to us. You're seeing a tenth of what we do to it once it gets down here. SWEET: They do everything in there. That's why this place has such a stink to it. Don't worry. You won't notice it after a couple months. There's some boys digging a tunnel to get us out of here. JOSIAH: Dick, they've got kids watching us here? Yeah, the Rebs are running out of men. They're robbing the cradle and the grave to guard us. Hey, Sesech. YANKEE: Ethan, don't do it. It's a trick. You know you can't trust the Reb. Hey, Johnnie. You got something to eat? Yeah, I got something to eat. What do you got? I've got two ears of corn. I'll give you a dollar for them. A Yankee greenback for both ears. You come over here. Not me. I'm not coming over there. Why not? Because it's the deadline. You'll shoot me if I do. Who says he will? You want something or not? Ethan, come on. Yeah, I want two ears of corn. Then step across. Won't last long if you don't. Don't trust him. He's a Reb. Don't trust him. Is he playing a game with him? JOHNNIE: Do what you want, Yank. This isn't a game. These kiddies, they scare me worse than the soldiers. They say they get a 30-day furlough if they shoot one of us. You'd better hurry. Going fast. All right. All right. Here I come. Hey, hey. Wait. [SHOUTING IN PROTEST] He warned him. He warned him. I warned him. [GUNSHOT] You know the rules. You all know the rules. I warned him, lieutenant. What do they do, Dick? Shoot you for fun in here? [GUARDS SHOUTING COMMANDS] GUARD #1: March. Charge. GUARD #2: Forward. GUARD #1: Spread out. GUARD #2: One, two. One, two. Hold the ranks. About face. Forward march! Captain. Capt. Wirz. Yes, sir? Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir I'm Col. Chandler. This is my aide, Lt. Dahlgren. The Department of War has detailed us to do an inspection of all our prison camps. We'll try not to create too much of a fuss. I expect we may be here some time. Of course. If there is anything I can do for you... No, no, no, you just go on about your duties. Should I need to speak with you, I, uh, I'll know where to find you. Good morning, sir. Good morning to you, sir. Oh, I feel like a king. Oh, five pounds of hair and 10 pounds of bugs. Oh. Well, you could use a little bit more there, Dick. GUARD #1: Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel! GUARD #2: Where? Over here. You! Come over here. Yeah, you. Get up. Get up, Yank. Found the Iowa tunnel. Headed this way. Oh, well, then... All right, move along, move along! YANKEE: It's just a well. 184th Pennsylvania. Gleason's men. It's just a well, I tell you! You've got to believe me. Shut up, Yank. I didn't do anything wrong! Hurry it up. No! Dick, are those the fellows you say are digging the tunnel? You're my sarge, but there's some questions in here that you just can't ask, sir. Please go tell the sergeant I'd be very grateful for a private word with him. Tell him we mean no harm and he can trust us. Go on, now. Yes, sir. Sgt. Gleason, I don't want to do anything against the grain here, but, uh, I've got some very good men who'll do anything they can to get out of this place. So if there's any way we can help you, we'd be much obliged. Call your men. Boys. What's your name, Sergeant? Jimmy McSpadden. Bring them in. All right, find a spot. Benton, watch the door. Yes, Sergeant. I told Sgt. Gleason we'd help with the digging and be glad for the chance. You men, you got any tools? Got any tools for digging, men? Knives, forks, spoons, pans, plates. All that stuff works. Yeah. That's perfect. What are the chances exactly of getting outside the walls? We know a thing or two about tunneling. These gentlemen are from West Pennsylvania. They're coal miners. MARTIN: And when we get outside... That's right. What happens when we get outside? They heard Wirz talking about the dogs. We saw the dogs. Who is this Wirz, anyway? Uh, well, he's Prussian or Swiss or something. He joined up with the Rebs. He wants to be a general. At least we shot his arm up pretty good in some battle someplace. We got a nice surprise for Wirz... Tobias. Sir. Sergeant. These men can be trusted. All right, now. Olek, open it up. Oh, Jesus. What do you think of that, huh? One of the slaves working on the wall brung us a map. I mean, hell, we can go creek and river the whole way. Swim, float on logs, creeks to Flint River, Flint to Apalachicola, Apalachicola all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. There ain't a dog alive that can track us if we never touch land. He's right. When can we start to help you with the digging? Soon as you eat in the morning. If you eat. It's hard work. You've got to keep your strength up and your wits about you. Things can get a bit squirrelly down there after a time. How long do you reckon it'll take? I figure a month. Maybe more, maybe less. Now, listen here. Pennsylvania boys know this, and you Massachusetts men, you've got to learn it quick. What goes on in here stays in here. Good. Well, all we have is some hardtack, but you're welcome to it. Oh, yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dick? No, I had mine. Thank you. I've got... I've got some... Oh, oh, oh. Sergeant... Whoa, whoa. All right. Give him some air. Massachusetts men, outside. Pennsylvania men too. Let's give him some air. Martin, you stay here. Uh, sorry, I... I got a little addled. That's all right, Sergeant. He took a bullet in the shoulder about two days ago. It's got to come out. All I got is this little hunting knife. You ever do anything like that before? [GROANS] I don't see as we have much of a choice. I guess not. Martin, see if we've got some rain water out there. Yeah, yeah, I... Look, I wish I had some whiskey or something. Me too. 'Course, I always wish I had some whiskey. All right. All right? Have at it. Okay. [SCREAMS] I've got a new man who needs some whiskey. I've got a shirt for trade. Raiders got some whiskey. Looking for some whiskey to trade. Got a good shirt. Looking to trade for some whiskey. I've got a sergeant... SAMSON: They got whiskey up there. MAN: What do you say, huh? Raiders got whiskey. Go up there, you come back without your shirt, without your whiskey, without one of your legs... if you're lucky. We'll have our day. When? We'll have it. I'm looking for some whiskey. I got a good shirt to trade for some whiskey. Dickie, nice haircut. Thank you, sir. I want you to meet Josiah. This is Patrick. Drummer boy from New York City. Nice to meet you. They caught him in Culpeper, right? Yes, sir. He's been here since they built this place. We call him the oldest man in here. Give us a hand tonight, my friend? Sure. We're looking for whiskey. Got a good shirt here. Need some good whiskey for a good sergeant. We're looking for some whiskey. [MEN PLAYING MUSIC AND SINGING] Sounds good, boys. Louder, boys. Louder. A man needs all the music he can get. Well, I seen some nice full haversacks today, boys. Hey, little Munn, any of them fresh fish look wounded to you? Not too many. Oh, that's too bad. Give me your cup, little rascal. How are the supplies doing, Curtis? I swear, I ain't seen bacon in over a week. CURTIS: I'll see to it. You do that. Delaney, I want a strict accounting of our catch tonight. You hear that, gentlemen? We are doing business here. Don't you forget it. DELANEY: Got to balance the books, huh? That's right. Square the ledger. Every day, boys, the population's getting bigger here. Each new fish brings something extra to our table. Stansfield. Sullivan. You keep them fires stoked.

Here it is. Is there any way to get a letter out of here, Dick? Yeah. You give the guards $2.00. You got $2.00? No. Well, I got $1.00 squirreled away and I'd be glad to give it to you, but they're going to demand two. Josiah, I've got to ask you. Do you think my father knows that I'm a prisoner? I mean, if you all thought that I was killed, then... I mean, I had written him this letter, but them bastards, they... they wouldn't send it. They said a dollar wasn't enough. Ah, just the idea that he thinks that I might be dead, you know? Well, just think, when you show up alive and kicking... [CHUCKLES] I don't know about the kicking. ♪ Oh!

In here, we call lice "greybacks." We race 'em and bet on 'em. We call Johnny Reb "greyback." Right? Well, in here, we call lice "greyback" and Johnny Reb, "lice." Oh, that gets better every time I hear it. The way you kill lice in here is you take your clothes and hold it up as close as you can to the fire without it catching, and you'll hear 'em. They'll pop right off. As far as the gnats and chiggers and flies, there's nothing you can really do about them. They get you even at night. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Rain. You must get a lot of rain here. Yeah, and when it rains, what you do is you collect it in your clothes and you wring it out. And that's what you drink. You don't drink from that swamp. I'm telling you, you'll get sick. It'll kill you. I've seen it happen. So, what do you do when it don't rain? You do without. You do? How? Teach yourself. You can get a swallow or two from one of these wells every now and then, but, hey, hey, Josie, a lot of these boys are not going to be able to, but you're going to be able to do it. Hear me? Look. Patrick. Hi. This is for your sergeant. Well, where'd you get this? Well, wait a minute. The shirt... Let me get that shirt. I had it, but the sergeant... Mm. The sergeant will taste this, he'll think he's gone to heaven. Will you show me what else I need to do, Dick... to stay alive in this place? We're going to go fishing again, Josiah, just as soon as we get out of here. I think about that more than anything else since I've been in here, casting a good line. You know, out of all of my friends, my father always liked you and your cousin the best. You know what? Me too. YANKEE: Raiders! Raiders! Okay, everybody grab something. Look out, now. There's more coming in from over there. You, Massachusetts... Go look after the sergeant. Right. Take 'em! That's him! Get him! Get everything they've got, boys. Get everything. Get it. Get everything. Get all the shirts. There's two of them. Give me that. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. I got a banjo! Good for you, little Munn. Good for you. Stick with Collins, boys. You'll live like kings. [CHEERING] You all right? Jeez... Good fight, men. Massachusetts men, are we all right? My banjo! My banjo... Martin, we'll get it. Martin, we'll get it back. Where's Josie? Dick's dead. Huh? Dick Potter. He's dead. Oh, Dickie... [JOSIAH SOBS] No! [GUARD SHOUTING ORDERS] YANKEE: Ninth Michigan. Nineteenth detachment, Indiana. Well, now... you been taking Dick to the dead house? Who's the Sesech? Well, now, that is a very important government colonel the government sent down here to inspect us. Ain't it nice to know they care? Got it on the way back from the dead house. It'd be good to brace the tunnel. Yeah, that's what I figured. JOSIAH: What are we doing here, boys? Is that your banjo, Martin? Was. Sergeant, how's the arm? All right. How are you? Let's see the eye. Buggered my knee. Billy, get some rain water, clean up the sarge. Trade for it if you have to. Yes, sir. He's a good, good lad. You know how many they've got lying in the dead house just from today? Forty-six. Sweet Jesus. That's two by the Raiders, one shot at the deadline, the rest of them... starved? I don't know. They look water-bloated. They're tying name tags around the big toes of most of them, I guess so when they bury them, there'll be some kind of record. Did you do that for Dickie? Yeah. Good. Good. He told me again about the water. We can't drink from the swamp. It'll kill you. We have to tell the men. Right. MCSPADDEN: Tuck! Thomas! JOSIAH: Boys! MCSPADDEN: Wisconsin, Ohio, over here. How's your sergeant? He don't look so good. Took a crack in the eye. Yeah, well, I can still see good enough to see you're no prettier than you were yesterday, Tyce. Now, listen. Go ahead, Josie. Tell them. JOSIAH: Boys, last night before it happened, Dick was telling me about the water here. You can't drink from the swamp. It'll kill you. Tuck... We need some shelter. You've got to sew us up something. They got my kit last night, my needles, thread, my shears. Somebody'll have some. Got some buttons? Some brass buttons. Trade 'em to the Rebs for stuff. Okay. Tuck, we'll get you a needle and thread. Whoo! You call that music? I've heard better noise come out of dried chicken guts. Here. Give us something a man can dance to. RAIDER: Dance, Collins!

Hey. You have any troubles down there, you just pull on this rope three times. Martin? How do you stay under the ground digging without... A few minutes, and I... I just get... It's what I do. It doesn't scare you, being down there? No. Was it hard the first time? My father took me. All his friends worked the mine. Sgt. Gleason's father works the mine. Tobias' father. Everybody works the mines. I look forward to it. How'd you learn to play the banjo? My father taught me that too. You really think I can learn? Yes, sir. Yes, I do. I could tell the other night. I could tell you're going to be good... real good. We'll keep watch with you. Long overdue, I say. Why just a watch? Why not wade into them and start breaking their heads off? That's what we should be talking about. Keep your voice down. You can't just wade into them. There's too many of them. We'll get every man here. Should have done it two months ago. It's just that everyone thought we was going to be exchanged. Sure we will. Any year now. Did it when we should've, my brother'd still be alive. Maybe we ought to take them on, huh? Come on. What are we feared of? We're not a bunch of little girls, you know. You can't keep a secret in a place like this. You go try and get together a thousand men to take them on, 'cause that's what it'll take, and they'll get you first. They will, and anyway, there's another reason I don't want to do anything now. Some of us are working on a tunnel. Yeah? Well, so are we, but... Well, what do you think? Well, for now, we just keep a watch, not go after them, but any the Raiders come for, the others'll help out. We'll all stand up for each other. All right? Nobody say yes if you don't mean it. You shouldn't have told them that, Toby, about us working on a tunnel. I know. As soon as I said it, I... Tunnel traitors turn you in for half an apple. It's just that they were making all these excuses, and I... We've got to tell Gleason. Yep. Tunnel has to be rushed now. Every one of us, whether we're tired or hungry or sick. We don't have a month anymore. Sergeant, I'm sorry. I know I made a mistake. The three of you, get outside. Watch whoever heard you. Any of them's a tunnel traitor, goes near a Reb, you know what the hell to do. MARTIN: Grundy. There. Tobias. I'll tell Gleason. Sergeant... it's Grundy. All right, boys. We've got a tunnel traitor. Quickly, now. Quickly. [WHISPERING] Lieuten... Lieutenant. [RAISES VOICE] Hey, Lieutenant! I've got something for you. What do you got for me, Yankee? I'll meet you down by the gate. Right now, all right? Tell me what you got now. I've got informat... I've got a letter to be mailed, sir. I'm told it takes two greenbacks. Can you help me out with it? Is it unsealed? I'm going to read it, now. Yes, sir. It is. You're a dead man. Hey. Hey, now! What you looking for, lieutenant? Lose something, did you? I'll tell you what he's looking for, a 30-day furlough, the Reb son of a bitch. By God, you bring him out here on the double, quick, right now. Pot-liquor bowl full of you Yankee sons of bitches! You're going to wish that you had crossed that deadline and got your ass shot! Goddamn you! You Yankee sons of bitches! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, thank you. It's a good tunnel. Good work, boys, for the little time we had, and the tools... It's not that good, but it's good for all that we need. Good job, boys. All right. First thing we have to do is figure out the order we go in. First ones out have more chance before they sound the alarm. More time to get away from their damned dogs. Yeah. So we're going to draw lots to fix the order we go in. No. Massachusetts men talked it over. It's your tunnel. You go first. He's right. Well, you... you helped us dig it. You, and you, you tunneling fool, Billy. You get back to Pennsylvania, I've got a job for you, boy. Got a job for you, Billy! I'm never going underground again. No? I just want to get back to New Bedford and breathe some good salt air. You got that... Fair's fair. You first. All right. All right. Agreed. Now, the second thing is we need one strong man to be last to support the beam, make sure everybody gets through in case the support gives way. He's got to be there to drag everybody out fast in case there's a cave-in. I'll do that. No. It's got to be a mining man, he's got to be able to see that cave-in coming. I'll stay with him. All right. John? What do we do with him? Leave him tied up there for a week. It'll do him good. Kill him! Hold it! Hold it! He's not going anywhere. I'm keeping my eye on him, because I'm staying here. I don't want to slow you down. Now, wait a minute. All we have to do is get to the river. Right? What is that? A mile or two? I can't really tell from the map. We'll leave him tied. Someone'll find him in the morning. You're coming with us. Josie, I don't want to... How soon do we go? Well, I figure there's only a couple of feet left to dig. An hour or so, maybe. We should go first chance, John. Those bastard Raiders may come after us any time. Or sell us to the Rebs for a crust of bread! We have to kill him, John. We can't leave him to turn traitor on someone else's tunnel. He's right. Should've killed him in the first place. MEN: Wait! No! Wait. TYCE: Just do it. Do it! Gleason. MARTIN: But, sergeant... [CUTTING] [SCREAMING] So now all the boys will know he's a tunnel traitor. Now, nobody can take this map, because if you're caught with it, it would lead them right to the rest of us, so you've got to study it now so you can find your way. I've already done my studying. Give that man your old boots. Got anything to trade? Now, do like I say. There's just one last thing. We're not all going to make it, but whoever does is honor-bound to get to Grant or Sherman and tell them what it's like in here. Tell him how many of his men have died, and that he has got to exchange for us, that... We'll leave in two hours, and with God's luck, we'll all meet at the river. Yes, sir. Sergeant. Thanks again. Good luck. You stay close. Follow me. [DOGS BARKING] [GRUNTS] Shh, shh. Okay. [LEAVES RUSTLING] All right? [GRUNTS] GUARD: Hey, Yank! Stop! [GUNSHOTS] Yankees escaping! Yankees escaping! The east wall! Martin! Yankees escaping! [BUGLE CALLING] Saddle up them horses on the double quick, now! Martin... Move it, move it! Ride hard, now! Go! [DOGS BARKING] Thomas! You hold there, now. Take this one back, put him in the stockade. There's more game out there, now, so let's go! Come on. Get up. [BARKING] [BARKING] Dogs. Tree. Tree. Hey. Look. Look. [LAUGHING] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] BARRETT: That's enough. One, two. One, two... No. No. No, no, no! Stop! [MUSIC STOPS] Halt. And halt. These musicians, they must be much, much better, and this, what you call marching, you will drill them until it's dark, or after dark, if necessary. They must be perfect tomorrow. Absolutely, sir. They will be. Oh, colonel. I hope you don't have to leave before we have the chance to welcome Gen. Winder back. Tomorrow morning. Oh, too bad, because they will improve very much. If you and your officers spent one hour a day improving the conditions of the stockade rather than planning these ridiculous little ceremonies... Colonel, excuse me. You must know I'm in charge of the guard force. You're also responsible for the operation of this prison. Oh, well, in part, but colonel... May I ask you a personal question, Capt. Wirz, something I need for my report? Oh, yes. Of course. I heard when you first came here from Switzerland 10 years ago, Yes? You had medical training. Absolutely true, Colonel. I am fully qualified... To what? To allow this disgrace to civilization? Colonel, please. You must not speak like this in front of my men. They'll hear it soon enough. I'm filing my report. Colonel, there are things I must say to you, but not in front of the men. We must talk. Please. Colonel, please. Thank you. Will you please... Colonel? Forward march! Will you please leave us alone? You must know, colonel, Gen. Winder is in charge here, totally, of food, medicine, supplies... I will report to the government what I think the general's responsibilities are. If you would like to discuss your own responsibilities for the deaths of more than 100 men in your care a day... I only meant that... You, captain, you, in one week, you could have finished a dam across the stream, made floodgates to flush out the waste. You could have built another camp to relieve the crowding. But you see, we have no tools. I asked for saws and axes... You have some tools, captain. I took inventory. You could parole prisoners to gather food from nearby plantations. I did, colonel, earlier, but they ran. Under guard. And let the prisoners build shelters. We have no canvas. Wood! I wanted wood, but Gen. Winder, he ordered all the trees... I have told you I will not discuss the general with you. Now, if you have anything else to say on your own behalf... I... most respectfully... please, you must tell them there is no one, absolutely no one in this war who has to deal with the circumstances I have to deal with. You have seen. You know that, but please tell them I do not complain. I am a soldier, colonel. I know my duty, and I fulfill it faithfully. Look at this arm of mine, shattered in the Battle of Seven Pines. Yes, you are a soldier, captain, so when you personally ordered the stocks to be built, and the ball and chain... Only for escaped prisoners. You knew you were violating the Articles of War, as you knew you were violating them when you had food withheld from prisoners as punishment. Now, was there anything else you wanted to say? It's true, colonel. Of course it is. It's all true. I know it will not surprise you that I agree with everything what you say, but I try, colonel. I try very hard. Look at those young boys in the Fife and Drum Corps out there. I paroled them so they wouldn't have to stay in that wretched stockade. I ordered the hospital moved out... outside of wall, where the air is cleaner. I ordered the stockade made bigger, but you know the problem. They just send us all the time more and more prisoners, on Gen. Winder's orders, 33,000 now, when we were built for only 8000, so of course I agree with you. With the proper help, we can do much more. Can you help us there, colonel? The problem is I need people. You know, perhaps if I was major instead of only captain, then I would have more staff assigned to me, and we could start to solve those problems together. They listen to you in Richmond, colonel, so I think if you put that recommendation in your... in your report, it would be most definitely helpful. Colonel, a couple of these here are dead. Looks like the legs gave out, they strangled. You think Capt. Wirz knows that? I don't know if he does. Well, well, go tell him. Yes, sir. Dear God almighty! Yes? GUARD #1: This one's alive, too, I think. GUARD #2: These here ones are dead. [MOANING] GUARD #3: Lieutenant, you mind helping me get these here ones back inside the walls? Would you help us with the gate, sir? Eugene, get these two to the dead house. Let's go, now. I'll get another wagon. [DRUMMING] Those who are not shot are caught by the dogs without fail and put in the stocks or ball and chain... but still, if you escape the dogs, go hundreds of miles to your own army? Not possible! Everybody's saying you got real close, closer than anyone ever did. Saw the river. Do you think Sgt. Gleason got away? I mean, really away? Maybe. Maybe. Good chance. I don't want it. I don't want it. No. Got to eat, Billy. Got to eat. I don't want to. I don't want to live... not here. As soon as I can stand, I'm going to walk across the deadline. WIRZ: Tunnels are useless. I'm going to die anyway. Come on, Billy boy. Come on. You're going to leave the rest of us alone here, Billy? Yeah. I am. Goddamn it, Billy. We're going to make it through this together, or we're not. Together! Don't make it easy for 'em. Now, eat. Eat! Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Fresh fish. BARRETT: Sergeant, Move 'em out. Hey... Fresh fish. Welcome to Andersonville. Fine looking place, don't you think? [LAUGHS] For a hog pen, maybe. You some of Grant's men from up in Virginia? ALL: Yes, sir. Yeah? Is that where youse get catched at? Yeah. Good, good. Let me show youse around, get you a decent place to stay. You want to be away from the swamp. Come on. You hungry? We'll get you something to eat. Come on up here. You'll like it up here. How long's it been since you ate? We'll get you men fixed up, me and my pards. Just follow me. COLLINS: Clean the fish, boys. Whose move? It's your turn. It's my move? Yes. All right. Son of a gun. I don't know. How's the game? He's cheating me. Psst. One, two, three. No, no, no. He did it again. Cheating little bugger... Beats me every time. Olek, tell me. When you were coming out of the tunnel with Gleason... Patrick... you finish the game later. Go ahead, Patrick. I want to speak to the doctor. Go. Yes, sir. We'll finish in a minute. Okay. He's a good boy. Little cheater. Now, when you were coming out of the tunnel, could you see Gleason? Did you see what happened to him? The dogs. Dogs got him. I got up a tree. He wouldn't stop. He kept running for the river, swinging a stick at those dogs, but Jimmy, you can't outrun dogs. No. I heard it. Knew they got somebody. Glad I didn't see it. I didn't either. Didn't want to. I'm not telling them. No point in it. He was like a father to them. He was a fighter. I just say, "I didn't really see." [BREATHES HEAVILY] When I get out of here... I'm never going south of New Bedford. [LAUGHING] Ever. [LAUGHS] Those who are not shot are caught by the dogs without fail and put in the stocks or a ball-chain, but still, if you escape the dogs to walk hundreds of miles to your own army, not possible. Tunnels are useless. Even if you are outside, I give any two men a 12-hour start, and then track you with the dogs, and you will suffer the consequences. But why bother anyway? I know absolutely there are talks going on this moment for exchange. You're a damn liar, Wirz. [MURMURING] Any day now... If John Gleason gets to Uncle Billy or old Ulys, then we'll get exchanged. You bet on it. So I suppose we understand each other. Move. Hey. Hey, fresh fish. Welcome to Andersonville. Fine looking place, don't you think? [LAUGHING] For a hog pen, maybe. Where'd youse get catched at? Virginia? MAN: Yes, sir. That's good. Means Grant's going forward, Bobby Lee's going back. Just the way we like it. Let me show you around, get you a good place to stay. You want to be up near the wall, away from the swamp. It don't stink so bad there. Ain't so many bugs, neither. Come on. You hungry? I'll get you something to eat. What happened to you? Well, we'll take care of that. Come on. Look at these vultures. Come up here where my pards are. Just waiting to rob and murder the new boys. Look at them! Filthy stinking cowards! We'll get you men fixed up, me and my pards. TOBIAS: Jim. Jim... Jim, there's a thousand of them. Come on. They have clubs and knives. We have nothing. Who's with me? Who? Who? Who's with me? Who? Who? Who? Who's with me? I... I'm with you, Jim! We're with you! We're with you! Who? You want 'em? Then let's get 'em! Yeah! Who? I'm with you. By God, I'm with you. What are you standing there for? Come on! We're with you. Form up! Form up! Who? Who? Form up. Form up. Form up! Who? Come on. Come on. Come on! Let's go! [CHEERING] I waited for this day. Come on. Come on! You slime-swilling pig. Come on. Hey. Hey! Wait till everyone's here before anybody gets anything. Hey! Let me see that. My shirt! Martin's banjo! We found your banjo, Martin. I say we hang 'em. I say we hang 'em all! String 'em up, murdering devils! I'm doing it with my own two hands. Now, just hold your horses, Jim. We're not murderers. Murder? To hang them? What they did was murder. Yeah! We're not hangmen. Anybody who wants to help, you come ahead, but if nobody has the sand for it, I'll do it myself, and I'm going to start... with you. CROWD: Yeah! Now, wait a minute. What about them? Do we hang them too? It's not murder. It's justice. I think the first thing we have to do, before anything else, is give them a trial. A what? A fair trial. Show them the fairness they showed my brother. They killed over 200 men in here. We must give them a trial, a fair trial with a jury and witnesses and a judge. What? Are we so much better if we do to them what they did to us? I think he's right. MAN: No! All right, all right, a trial. Now, that's going to take time. What are we supposed to do with these men in the meantime? If we keep them here with us, someone will kill them. Yeah, they will. All right. We'll ask Wirz. CROWD: Wirz? We'll ask Wirz to keep them under guard outside the walls and deliver them back to us for trial when ready. Bring them on in. How would this trial be conducted? According to the rule of law, captain. Both sides would have lawyers to speak for them. The Raiders would be allowed to speak for themselves, question the witnesses... You would have a jury? Yes, sir. New men who come in after today so they wouldn't be prejudiced against the defendants. [STIFLES LAUGHTER] I've never in my life heard of anything like this. These men, these Raiders, they're as bad as they say? Animals, captain. Cutthroats and murderers. Even as Yankees go, these are the worst of the worst. If I allow this, it will make your task easier, keeping order in the stockade? BARRETT: Might just do that, sir. They're real troublemakers. I've seen you before, haven't I? I was one of the men caught escaping. You had me in the stocks for a week. Ah, and you won't make that mistake again, will you? As a lawbreaker, you agree with this? Yes, I do, captain. I will get you the law books. Keep the proceedings in writing. You will send the findings and the sentences to me, and if everything is in order, the sentence will be ordered for execution. Keep the ringleaders under lock and key until they ask for them. Sir. Well? Have your trial. [YELLING] Order! Let's have order. Quiet! Quiet down! Quiet! Quiet! Who's speaking first? I am, Your Honor. Sgt. Horace Trimble, Ninth Indiana Volunteers, appearing for the prosecution, and may I present to this court the Honorable Jared Hopkins, Esquire? [CROWD ROARS] I want order! 102nd New York Volunteers appearing for the defense. Boo! All right! Order. It is my job to prove to these men, who arrived here but yesterday, that the men here on trial behaved like savages... MAN #1: Damn right! Barbarians and worse in this camp, while the rest of you are soldiers in the Federal Army who conducted and will conduct yourselves accordingly. I trust there'll be no more such outbursts. Mr. Hopkins, I beg your pardon. Please say what you had to say, sir. MAN #2: What could you have to say? I do not envy you men at all. Yesterday, you arrived in hell. I do not speak lightly. Andersonville is not just a place without food to eat... or water to drink... or a place to come in out of the rain from. [CROWD YELLING] It is not just a place where guards murder us for their sport. MAN #3: Hang them! Kill them all! It is a place without civilization. It is a place without law! Stop this farce now! JUDGE: Order! Let's have some order here! And you will hear how men, good Union men... MAN #1: Traitor! Traitors! What do you know about them, huh? Were driven mad! Now, I will not be silenced! These men were driven by these circumstances not of their own making... [YELLING] not of their own making to commit, understandably... MAN #4: Liar! No! No! Acts of desperation they never would otherwise have committed! We stood it. This is hogwash. Hang the bastards! You're wasting time. I will be heard! JUDGE: Order. Order. I will be heard! [CROWD QUIETS] That is the second reason I do not envy you men. You are being asked to sit in judgment on soldiers in your own Federal Army. [CROWD YELLING] These men are victims as well, and their conduct must be understood as being caused by the Rebels. [CROWD YELLING] The Rebels... The Rebels are the ones ought to be on trial before you... not the men of your own army. MAN#5: Traitors. [CROWD YELLING] JUDGE: Call your witnesses. MAN #6: Send them down here. We charge these men here with being thieves who stole from their fellows... MAN #7: Traitor! Food, clothing, possessions of every kind... SAMSON: And more! Always brutally and without mercy, frequently under cover of night. CROWD: Yeah! You will have all the witnesses to that you want. Is there anyone here who can say they did more? MAN #8: Yeah. Who saw one of these, I exempt the six ringleaders, who saw one of these commit or order another to commit murder? MAN #9: Stealing food's just as bad as killing them! If so, and he will swear to it... let him now come forward. Is there anyone here who saw one of these six commit murder? CROWD: Yes! Or order another to commit murder of another federal soldier... CROWD: Yeah! To steal his goods or for any other reason? CROWD: Yeah! If so and he will swear to it, let him come forward now. MAN #10: I'll swear. MAN #11: I swear. MAN #12: I swear. I swear. I'll swear. MAN #13: I swear, by God. MAN #14: Let me swear! I swear! Yeah, I'll swear. MAN #15: I'll swear. MAN #16: I'll swear. MAN #17: I swear. MAN #18: I swear. I swear. TRIMBLE: Cpl. Day, take the stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. You can sit. TRIMBLE: Cpl. Day. Tell the jury what you've seen with your own eyes, corporal. Yes, sir. I, um... Before I do, sir, may I ask Sgt. Hopkins a question? Certainly. Sgt. Hopkins... did I understand you to say that no law applies in here? You did indeed, corporal, and that is the very point. There is no law here. There is starvation, roasting heat, freezing cold. There is disease... acts of barbarism... and cruelty on all sides. But what law? Rebel law! We do not obey Rebel law! The fact is... there is no law here for my clients to have broken. MAN #19: You shyster! [CROWD YELLING] SAMSON: There is law here. What do you mean? Therefore, they cannot be guilty. CROWD: You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. JUDGE: Order! Order! I thank you, sir. You are wise beyond your years. SAMSON: Josie, what are you doing? But that cannot be, sir. We live by laws here. The law of survival, Corporal. We do not stop belonging to the Federal Army because we're here. SAMSON: That's right! We have our sergeants. We maintain order and discipline as best we can. Now, we stand in line to get what little food they give us. We do not steal from each other. We do not betray each other to the Rebels. I am saying that men can be excused if they do extreme things, necessary things... in order to stay alive in a place like this. What they did they knew to be wrong. Every man knows to be wrong. They are against every man's law and understanding. None of the rest of us did those things. They did them to live, corporal. To live! All men want to live, sergeant, but there are some things men won't do just to live! What things? That's what we must hear here. What has been done here? Murder was done here. CROWD: Murder! Tell them about Dick Potter. Dick Potter... Dick Potter and his father were the best fishermen in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joined up the first summer of the war because he wanted to, because he thought he ought to. He was a good soldier... and he was shot in both legs and captured at Antietam and brought here. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. You can sit. What's your rank, soldier? Private. All right, private. You tell us what you saw. I've seen each of these six men. They've murdered. They've robbed. Tell them what happened, corporal. Sergeant, it was the first day the 184th came into camp... Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes, sir. I do. You can sit. Now, you tell us what you saw, young man. Sir, I saw that man, that man, Collins... That's the one that killed my brother, Richard. And that little sailor down there cost me my leg the first week I was in here, and the fellow in the green has killed a lot of men... a lot of men in here. They're all murderers, every one of them. Every one of them! FOREMAN: We've heard enough. Those are guilty of thievery and low cowardly assault on their fellows. Give them the ball and chain or make them run the gauntlet. Every man who wishes gets a shot at them with his fists, sticks, anything you can get your hands on. [CROWD CHEERING] These six... hang 'em. [CROWD CHEERING] Prisoners, I return these men to you as good as I got them. You have tried them yourselves and found them guilty. I have had nothing to do with it. Do with them as you like, and may God have mercy on you and on them. Company! About face! Forward march! [DRUMMING] My God, you don't mean to really hang us up there? That's about the size of it. No! I just want to live. I just want to live! This is nothing. Keep your peckers up, boys. We'll have no weakness here. What? Did you think you were going to live forever? Devils! Devils! Let me hang! This is nothing, boys. Doesn't matter a damn. Doesn't matter at all. Let's get this done right, Jim. Don't you worry about that. [CROWD CHANTING]: Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Hang! Okay, boys. On three. One. [MUNN WEEPING] Two. Three! Fresh fish. Lots of them. Uncle Billy's army must be close. Hmm. Could be rescued soon. Nah. Rebs got to keep ferrying new boys in, keep the population up. Martin, drink some of this. It's rainwater. It's good for you. Scurvy. Gums all rotten. Can't even eat the mush anymore. I miss Thomas. Don't you? The sergeant and I were just talking about him this morning. You know him before the Army? He didn't live but 10 miles from me, but... You know, the sergeant was saying for a man so strong, he never once saw him use his strength in anger. Except to get my banjo back. Oh, sweet. You know, he lived on a farm with his brothers and sisters. He had a big family. I have six children. Six? Had eight. Two died. All right, let's see. She'll, uh, she'll start us out with... with some nice plump chickens from our own stock. We breed them ourselves. Rhode Island Reds. Tenderest meat you ever ate. Yeah? She fries them, and we'll have them with, uh, mashed potatoes and gravy. Mashed potatoes? I like my mashed potatoes with butter. You know, we make butter in our spring house. You never had butter like we churn. Sounds good. You bring the butter. All right. We could put it on the biscuits. My mother, she makes the best biscuits in the world. Yeah, you just open them up, lift the top right off. Oh, my. You got any honey? Yeah, of course we've got honey. All right. We'll have some honey, then. What'll we have next? Uh... Pie. Apple? Apple. Or cherry. Apple and cherry. Save me the leftovers. Good God, men. You want to drive us all to the lunatic asylum? Stuff a sock in it. Hey, friend. What's the news, lads? Where were you and who were you with? We was with Uncle Billy Sherman. Grant in Virginia. All over Virginia. Making it warm for Johnny Reb, were you? Warm? Warm? Let Atlanta burn to the ground. Is that warm enough for you? Now we're headed down to Savannah, and we'll give them some of the same, you bet. So this is Andersonville, huh? Yeah, this is it. Bad as they say? Nah. It's worse. You boys, you want to stay with us? All right with you? Don't see why not. Come on over here, lads. Come with us. You boys, you hear anything about an exchange? There won't be any exchange, and that's a fact. You seem pretty sure about that. I should. I was at Sherman's headquarters the day Grant issued the policy. What policy? Haven't heard anything about that. We've been out of touch for a while. What policy is that exactly? Any Reb soldiers he lets go, they just bust their paroles and back on the line fighting us again the next week. He's not going to do it. Says his only job's to win the war. Rebs are saying as part of an exchange, they won't give back our colored soldiers. Grant says they're a part of us, and without them, no deal. The niggers? We're supposed to die here for niggers? I say good for Ulysses S. Grant. Does he know what it's like in here? He does for a fact. Somebody got out, told him. Got out? Where'd you hear that? I don't remember his name. Any of you boys remember? Do you know what he looked like? Uh, sort of tall, thin. The hair had some yellow in it. He was older than me, I reckon. Could his name have been Gleason? That's it. Yeah, John Gleason. [CHEERING] All right! Whoo! We're going to die in here, Josie. Just because there's no exchange... You heard how the Army's doing. First Atlanta, Savannah... Maybe we'll... we'll be rescued. Savannah's toward the sea, and we're inland. The Army's headed the other way. Would you write a letter to my wife and children? Martin, I... She'd probably want that. Oh... you put a toe tag on me now. You go to the dead house without a toe tag, and they'll never know where you're buried. Martin? Martin, did you hear? Did you hear? Josie, did you hear? John made it. He made it, Martin. He got to Sherman. He said he would. Damn if he didn't do it! Oh, Gleason. Goddamn if he didn't! Well, then, hand me the banjo there. I'll play some dancing music. Play something happy, Martin. Josie... [PLAYS WEAKLY] [GUNSHOT] You Yankees! You Yankees! You listen up, now. Colonel's got something real important to tell y'all, so you sergeants, you bring them down here on the double quick, now. Get up. Let's go. Come on. Come on, Billy. Let's go. [MEN COUGHING AND GROANING] [DRUMMING] The colonel comes with an important message for all of you. Col. O'Neill. You men, you prisoners, I want to talk to you about your situation here. It must be clear to you by now that your government has cruelly abandoned you. As you know, they have turned down all of our efforts to exchange you. They know of your suffering, which, though terrible, is no worse than the suffering of our men in Northern prisons, and they know, as we all do, that you have had to endure far more than should be expected of you, and now that your government has no further use of you, you are being thrown aside to starve and die. That being so, and with the Southern Confederacy certain to succeed and achieve its independence in just a few more months, I make you all this offer. If you will join our army and serve it faithfully to the end, you will receive all the rewards that the rest of our soldiers do. You'll be taken out of this place at once. Today. This very minute. You'll be clothed and fed. You'll receive a nice cash bounty, and at the conclusion of the war, you will have your very own farm. That is our offer, men. What is your answer? Colonel, sir. Sgt. James Dudley McSpadden, 19th Massachusetts volunteers, sir. I have the honor to speak for my detachment, sir. First Detachment! Form ranks! Attention... Detachment! About face! Forward... march! One, two. One, two. Three cheers for Sgt. McSpadden! Hip, hip! ALL: Hooray! Hip, hip! ALL: Hooray! Hip, hip! ALL: Hooray! Detachment, march! One, two. Second Detachment! Form ranks! Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. Form ranks! Seventh Detachment. Form... Form ranks! About face. Forward march! One, two. One, two. Attention, detachment. Forward march! Hey, hey, hey! Get away from him, you lousy rag-picker. MCSPADDEN: that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted thee... [LABORED BREATHING] Easy, son. Fever. [COUGHING] Got the fever. [COUGHS] [DRUM PLAYING] WIRZ: So gather around. SOLDIER: Rise up, you Yankees. Y'all are weak demons for sitting too long. Move on up, now. Move on up! Now, everybody, please gather around. I have some good news for you. It will make you very happy. Go on, listen to what the captain has to say! Yes, gather around. Move on up, now. Move along, on up. Gather around. You are being exchanged, starting today. Every one of you, starting right now, this morning. You see? All this time, I was right. [CROWD CHEERING] I was right, and you didn't believe me. Go tell the rest. Everyone is exchanged. [CHEERING] The train leaves in two hours. The gate is open. [DEATH RATTLE] The gate is open! We're exchanged. Martin? Patrick. Patrick, come on. Come on. We can leave. Billy... Come on. Come on, lad. Get up. [♪♪♪] ["BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC" PLAYING]
