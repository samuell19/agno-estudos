THE HORSE IS THE WINGS OF MAN Kyrgyz proverb Hey, Suke! Don't fool about, open up! You'll lose anyway! Hey, Suke! Suke! Open it! Hey, Mambet! What are you doing? Mambet! A film by Aktan Arym Kubat Was it your shift? - Yes, it was. And you fell asleep? - No. It's odd. The dogs didn't bark. Enough babble! You know how much Lord is worth? - Yes. If the horse isn't found, you'll be paying for it. Hi. And what do you think? Sadyr. He's the district's known horse-thief. Call me if you catch him. Let's go. Pour some tea for Nurberdi. You should talk more with your son. You know the doctors say that he has to hear people speak, but you're busy all the time. Let him play with other children. He'll learn to speak more quickly with them. Nurberdi doesn't want to play with anyone and only listens to you. All right. Push it harder. No one could stand up to the flashing, cleaving swords, the speeding arrows... and the hard, sharp spears of Kyrgyz mounted warriors. All enemies were defeated. And the reason for this were their horses... who split the wind with their chests, shook the earth with their hoofs, and rushed forth like a flood. And lending wings to them, the patron of horses, holy Kambar Ata... Come here. God bless you. POLICE Hello. Will you spit it out alone or shall I help you? What's that, Commander? Don't pretend, you bastard. There'll be big races in autumn. I ordered a racehorse especially for those races. It cost fifty thousand. Do you hear? Fifty thousand euros! Last night someone stole him! They say you had a hand in it. Wait, Commander. I swear on my children it wasn't me! Commander, yes, I am a thief. But I don't steal racers, Commander. I steal herds and take them to Kazakhstan, or I bring them here from Kazakhstan. They go to the slaughterhouse and to the market. Don't be smart! Maybe people who envy me told you to do it! Like Turdu, say! Commander, there's honour among thieves! I'm a born and raised horse-thief. But I'd rather die than break my oath, Commander! I know... I know... what your oath is worth! Let's wait a bit. Then we'll see... How are you? Fine, thanks. Shall I pour you some more? - Please. Your maksym is delicious. Some more? - No... That's enough! Thanks! Can you put it on my tab? - Yes. You forgot your thing! Thanks. Goodbye. - Come again when you're thirsty. -Okay. So, you say we used to be centaurs a long time ago? Jakyp was for sure. He never fails to hit on a woman. A real stallion! What's the news? - The missionaries are here. You take care of them. Boss, I tried. They want to speak to you. - Come here. I told you to go deal with them! - Okay. Listen to them, they're close to God. It might help you. Go sit down. Hello! Hello. I'm listening. - Hello! May peace and calm reign in your charitable house. May nothing sadden you under gracious Allah's sky. Thank you for your wishes. And so? - Mr Karabay... we all live under Allah's all-seeing eye. And we hope not to waste our lives on this mortal earth. We are just servants of Allah. - I too... consider myself faithful. Get to the point! Excuse us, respected sir. The time of the sacred Hajj to Mecca is drawing close. He who completes the Hajj fulfils one of the five sacred duties. He who takes upon himself the expenses of another Muslim can mitigate his sins twofold. If I pay for the three of you, my sins will be mitigated threefold? - Four times over! Four times! Let's go. Follow me. Hey, come on. Come here. Enter. You are close to God, unlike myself. I want you to pray to God and find my horse that was stolen. If you succeed, I'll cover your expenses for the journey to Mecca. Go ahead. It's time to sleep. Let's get you undressed. Off to bed. Bless you. Live long. That's it. Sleep. "The Red Apple" by Tolomush Okeyev Hello! Good news! - I'm in your debt! Show him! I took out my herd this morning and saw this strange horse. He's obviously a noble stallion. I knew he was yours. Lord, Lord, Lord! I found you! You're alive! Alive, my sweetheart! Reward Arzy for the good news. How much do I give? - Work it out yourself for a change. Thank you very much! Live long, Arzy. How are you doing? Maksym... There's no maksym left... And I wanted to go home early today. May I walk you home? Walk me home? Oops! When you were the projectionist at the club, I often went to the cinema. Really? I love Indian films. For example, "Sangam"... "Sangam"? I've projected "Sangam" so many times! I like it too. - When you brought a new film, you always had this very serious air. Me? You never told us what film would be shown that evening. Really? And I would wait with my friends till evening. We'd wait for you to hang up the poster. You still remember all that? I'm going to Bombay To look for a job What am I to do If there's no work for a poor guy like me? Oops! Maripa! Maripa! Is your mother home? Call her. Someone's come here. How are you? I came to talk to you... Your husband has a lover. Another woman, I say. Damn, how can I explain this to her? Ah, you want me to write it? Wait. In Russian? I saw them with my own eyes. Okay, I'm in a hurry... Where did you come from? You, woman, tell me. Who is he? What's your problem? Go home! Go! What? - My bags. I need to get my bags. Hey, you degenerate! If I see you here again, I'll break your legs! You hear? - Don't touch him. Don't! Bitch! Go. Who is he? - It's not your business! We all live under Allah's all-seeing eye. We are just servants of Allah. A Muslim's duty must be performed. All we are doing is what the Prophet Muhammad said. Come to the mosque. Oh, thank you, my dear, thank you! Come to the mosque. Thanks to the grace of God, and with the help of your prayers... My horse has been found! Thank God. - How are you, sir? Let's go! Now you are my dear guests! Come on. Come... Let's go. - Come in the evening to the mosque! Good that he was found. - Right. You brought me luck! - Thanks be to Allah. Good to hear. Hey, Nurberdi. Are you going to talk some day? A hare. A horse. It rides this way, right? And this is a dog. You show us now. What happened? Nothing. I'm just not in a good mood. Listen, there's a faith healer in the next village. Shall we go and show her Nurberdi? You believe in that? Please. Please. All right. Let's go there, okay? I don't regret at all... I don't regret not being able to speak or hear. Are you tired? Hello. - Hello. How are you? How are you? - Fine. Who's last in line? - I am. You can go before me. You go. Okay, goodbye. Go inside. You came from afar. Go ahead. Go in. Boss, Sadyr's here. - So what? Hello! Come, Sadyr, come. Don't take it bad. Forgive me, my dear. Get down. Tell me what you came for. Cool that your horse has been found. - Right. But I'll always be a suspect until the real thief has been found. You know who did it? No. But I have an idea. - Let's hear it. You know there've been similar cases nearby? And the horses were found. - I heard. The best racers were taken. But I didn't much care. Carry on. As the horses were returned to their owners, nobody reported it and there was no investigation. I want to catch the bastard and stop the slander against me! What's required of me? Turdu bought a new racer. But he hasn't mentioned it yet and is training in secret so he can announce it right before the races. So he bought it, after all! Green with envy. Commander, I suggest we talk to Turdu. - Why? Let's start a rumour that he brought a great racer who's faster than Lord! The thief will take the bait! - What if he doesn't? He will! He has no choice! His obsession won't leave him in peace. Commander. Call Turdu. Hello Turdu! It's me, Karabay... A long, long time ago... Kyrgyz people had... a malicious... and greedy... governor, Merez khan. He declared war on other peoples and began to conquer their lands. Merez khan turned the subjugated people into slaves, burnt their houses and severely punished those who resisted. Then, one night, summoned by the prayers of these unfortunate people, the patron of horses, Kambar Ata, descended in the form of a horse upon Merez khan. He said: "Hey, Merez khan! Do not harm people and stop destroying everything!" The cunning Merez khan ordered that the speaking horse be seized and slaughtered. When the warriors lassoed Kambar Ata and tried to kill him, he vanished into the air. Because of accursed Merez khan, prosperity and well-being left our lands for centuries. And so far, no fine fellow with a pure heart has been found to ride the fastest steed through a moonlit night and call on Kambar Ata, spiritual patron of all horses, and ask for his forgiveness! Your Sharapat has had her fill of her lover's lash. She's stuck at home. Why? You go and ask her. Maybe she needs comfort or a massage of some kind. In summer, as the moon was full Among a thousand flowers On a hilly mountain Was a girl in love with blossom She I still recall Her moonlike face remains in my memory Oh, in my memory... Oh, in my memory... You've heard? Karabay has found his racer. It was ridden hard and let go. I told you Sadyr had a hand in it. Sadyr leaves no traces! You know that. Again your prattle! - I don't prattle! Turdu had someone steal Lord to spoil its shape. Because his own horse is racing, too. Don't talk rubbish! Would someone steal a horse, then free it? Don't believe me? Turdu got himself a new racer. Take hold! My brother works for him. He told me. Turdu bought him a month ago for 150,000 dollars, then hid him at the hippodrome in town to train him there in secret. Now he pampers him in his stable! People say your horse cost a great deal. - All lies. I bought him for 20,000 dollars. But he's a thoroughbred, that's for sure! Where is he? Here you are! My precious! Will your maniac appear today? He'd better. We've spread the rumour all around. He will. He'll appear when least expected. Well, you know best... What's this? That's my alarm system. Oh, damn. Do you know geese saved Rome? - Yeah. You believe that? I do. They guard better than dogs! Let's go, Turdu, there's nothing for us to do here. Let's celebrate Lord's been found. I already had the sauna heated. We'll take a steam, drink cool beer, invite some company. And then we go to my place. Watch out! He'll hardly come tonight. But be on guard just the same! If I were him, I'd come today! - Well, we'll see! Sharapat! Who is it? I've come to pay my debt... Come in. I'm a little sick. Sit down! - Please, don't worry. -No, do sit. I'll put on some tea! I got paid today, so I came to clear my debt. Make yourself comfortable. I'll put the tea on! On the market... Burma told me... Why should I hide from you? After all, we are no longer children... The man you saw last time is Sadyr. After my husband's death, he stood by me, supported me... But now... I'm more disappointed with him by the day. Did he beat you? And is this lad your husband? Yes, my husband. We only lived together for half a year after our marriage, then... Then... he perished in Afghanistan. It's been almost 25 years now that I've lived alone. Sadyr and my husband served together in Afghanistan. What am I doing sitting here? I'll bring the tea! Maripa! Maripa! Didn't I say your husband has a lover? You don't believe me! Oh, damn! I have to write it for you! HE'S AT SHARAPAT'S. Here. Believe me now? Give that here! That's enough. - Have more. No, that's enough for me. - Have some more. I've really had enough. I wanted maksym. How stupid I am! It didn't occur to me! Wait. But... If you only knew... how I wait for you to come and drink maksym every day! And to see you. You're not like everyone else. You don't even know what you're like. You have such kind eyes! I always feel... the warmth in your eyes. You know... - My wife and son are waiting at home. What happened? You have another woman? Who told you that? I saw you in the house of the woman who sells maksym. You followed me? - What did you do there? I drink her maksym. I owed her money. That's all! Don't bug me! Come to me. My darling. Looks like he's here! I can't see. - Wait. You'll see him now. I'll go and look. You'll scare him away. Let's go! Call Turdu and Karabay quick! Catch him! You idiots! It's me, Sadyr! Let go of me! What are you waiting for? Catch the thief! Stop there! Catch him! Catch him! Cut him off! Grab him! Stop! I said stop! Don't touch him! Get off! Shut the gate. Brother? It's you? It was you? Hey, Karabay, damn you! What are you doing? Is this a joke! - Wait. Are you and your guys having a laugh at my expense? I'll punish him myself, Turdu! All your kin are thieves! I'll punish him myself, Turdu! Turdu, I'm sorry. This is on me! Just be patient! Be patient. Turdu! Come along. Come. Hello. Come inside. Stay here a while. Don't let anybody in. Sit down. Sit down. Did you think about your son? How old is he? He is five. And your wife is an invalid! If you go to prison, how will they manage? Why did you do it? Tell me. I thought you'd beat me! I'd do that and worse if you were a stranger. Hey, brother! Why did you do it? Tell me. Why? A long time ago... when we were as strong and united as a fist, Europeans called us centaurs... - I know the story! I know it! Because of it you lost your name and people mockingly call you Centaur! Tell me honestly, brother! Why do you steal racers and ride at night like a crazed man? Is it a passion? Our ancestors... lived in peace and harmony. Let's take our grandfathers. They always shared with each other, and were inseparable as brothers. And yet we're already strangers even though we're related. Why do people become mean-spirited? You're right. Our grandfathers shared a father and a mother. And for long years, our kin have been connoisseurs of horses. But brother, don't say we are like strangers. Each has his own destiny. It turned out that I became rich. Or did you steal my horse out of envy? That's not what I mean. - Let's talk straight. I treat you like a relative. I arranged your marriage, paid all the expenses. You could have found someone else instead of Maripa. But in fact you were still a bachelor at the age of fifty! And Maripa is not a bad wife. She bore you a son, runs the household. What else do you need? Want me to get you that maksym-saleswoman Sharapat as concubine? Why give me that look? The entire village gossips about it! Brother... my dear... tell me the truth. Why? Why do you steal racers and ride at night like a crazed man? Tell me, my dear, tell me. Once I had a dream. The great Kambar Ata came to me in the form of a white horse. He said, "Long ago, we came in herds to you from the waters of the great rivers to be as brothers to you and as horses, to become the wings of humans. We lived on this land as inseparable friends. But then... humans mistook themselves for gods, and began to despoil mother nature for the sake of wealth and power." When I remember Kambar Ata's eyes, and see the tears of horses slaughtered for feasts, my heart breaks and there is no peace within me! We feel no shame... when we say the horse is the wings of man. We lost our wings! We lost our spirit! We have turned into monsters! Move along. Turn to the wall. Go inside. To have a horse-thief in our village brings dishonour upon us! Now the whole district is laughing at us! What shall we do with him? What suggestions are there? Dear fellow villagers! I, too, am upset that we have a thief in our village! Especially since he's my relative! But his deed... how should I put it... It's hard to even call him a thief. My fellows, we all have nomadic ancestors. Since time immemorial, we have been inseparable from horses. When my brother saw a good racer, his Kyrgyz blood boiled and he couldn't stop himself. There is much else I could say, but, in short... my brother can work in my stables. He is the son of a horse-herder, so let him look after horses. If he wants to ride a racehorse, let him take any he likes. And moreover, in order to cleanse his soul, I will take him to the Hajj, to Mecca. - That's right! When he sees a holy place... he will come to his senses. Right... If you don't disagree. Why do you indulge him? The only place for him is jail! He'll come to his senses when he eats jail gruel! Let him be punished for an innocent man being blamed! Hey! A thief himself and see how he speaks! Who let you speak? Shut your mouth! His family isn't enough for him, he goes after other women! Shame on you! What? - Sit down and shut up! Silence, silence! Calm down! Any other suggestions? None? Then I ask those in favour of Karabay's offer to raise their hands. Unanimous! Villains! Well, and what do you say, Centaur? Hey, you bastard... If I ever see you again... you bastard... I'll break your legs! You bastard! If I see you again, I'll drag you behind my horse until you're dead! I know why you steal racers! I know you're looking for Al-Buraq. Buraq who? - Don't you know? Al-Buraq is the Prophet's horse. The Prophet flew on Al-Buraq up to the seventh heaven... to behold Allah with his own eyes. How else would the illiterate Prophet have gained so much knowledge and wisdom? You want to get closer to God and are looking for your Al-Buraq, right? Yours is a good dream. But people won't understand you. People are ignorant, unschooled. Not only do they not understand, they think you a fool and laugh at you. You... must never tell your sacred wish to anyone. It should be kept deep in your soul. I also have a secret. I can see little angels, patrons of rivers, lakes and mountains. Sometimes I talk and share my ideas with them when there's no one around. I know Islam regards it as heresy. So I wear the mask of a fool. You too should pretend to be a simpleton and they'll leave you alone. Otherwise it'll end badly. I have six daughters. The angels said my seventh child will be a son. Let people laugh at me, in the end my wish will come true. Burma! Good evening. - Evening. Come inside, please! - No, thank you. Do you know where Maripa has gone? She left without a word. Don't worry. She has no place to go. She'll be back soon. I know women... Maybe you'll have something to eat? - No, thanks. Wait. Jibek, bring bread! At least break bread... "The Red Apple" by Tolomush Okeyev It seems Centaur is lustful! That is why his wife and son left him. - Why mention that here? He's both a thief and a trouble-maker! I don't know what the court of elders thinks, but I suggest severe punishment. Take a look at you! Young Kyrgyzs never wore beards or clothes like underwear. Kyrgyzs wear that to bed. You desert your family to do missionary work! Hey, woman, shut your mouth! Hey, smart ass! - What? I'll have you know, Kyrgyz women have ruled the people, battled enemies and saved their native land! Isn't that right? - It is! Yes! And you cover them from head to foot, isolate them from people and brainwash them! Get out of my sight, you heretic! Watch your tongue! - I'm watching it already. Faith is to help men become pure. You use it as a tool to drive them mad! - That's enough! Be quiet! Aren't you ashamed? We all know Karabay has been a good relative to Centaur. However, the problem... is not in Karabay, it's in Centaur. You are all fervent about tradition and customs. I cannot break with tradition, either. I also don't see any other solution than to expel Centaur... from our village. That's right! This elder acts wisely! All those in favour raise your hands! Get out of here! Be tolerant! Be merciful! He must leave! That's right! It's right! He must leave! To the horses! Hey, stop! Stop, you bastard! Stop! I'll shoot you! Stop, you beast! I'll shoot you! Father. Father. - Speak. Father! Keep saying it. Father!
