Or did he cop a feel on you too, Miguel? - Hey my bad, baby girl, I thought... - I know what you thought. You see all these women here twerking. Obviously, they must all be begging for your attention. - I mean... - I mean, you're Jacob Austin, correct? Son of philanthropist Michael Austin? Owns half of Malibu, has a software company, and a hand in Hollywood. I mean, who wouldn't be dying to have your hands all over them? - Wait, wait, wait. How did you know... - Because I know, little Jacob. Wealthy, obnoxious, and clearly lacking where it counts. You're a rape case waiting to happen. If you ever even think about touching another woman without her consent, you better hope she's not one of my clients. - Classy party, Oscar. - Daniella Hernandez, I'd like you to meet my newest artist... - Lil Ag, AKA Phillip Jones. Graduated magna cum laude from O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth, Texas. You dropped out your junior year, moved to Los Angeles to pursue your dream of becoming a rap star, and you did. Only problem you have is that temper. - How did you... - Your job is to create the art. My job is to protect you and keep you out of trouble. I do that by knowing everything about everybody in the room and outside of it. For example, Oscar, I know there are three undercover officers in the lobby as we speak. My guess is they're not here for the mints on the pillow. My guess is you have about 60 seconds before they storm your little party here and tear this place apart. 59... 58... 57... - Hands on your head and get on the ground now! - We good. We good. - Now! - Hey, come on, chill. - Now! Get on the ground now! - Madam DA, it looks like we're too late. They had to have been tipped off. - Log this in, Officer. Daniella Hernandez. I wish I could say it was good to see you, sister. - I wish I could say the same, sister Rucker. - Actually, that's District Attorney Rucker now. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I guess I should congratulate you too, living the dream or the nightmare, depending on which side of the bed you're on. You would have made such a great prosecutor, but you were always interested in music. A complete waste of true talent and time if you ask me. - It's a good thing no one's asking you. - I take it these two are your clients? - They're both my clients. - Wait, y'all two know each other? - Sorority sisters. - Sisters, but not family. - Well that's, uh... That's lovely. - Where are the drugs, Oscar? - I already told your mans over there. I don't know what you're talking about. - I know you are the one who screwed this up. My team had solid intel that your convict client here was bringing powder in by the kilo and funneling it through this little thot party. - Well, obviously... solid is a bit of an exaggeration. - I know people like you. Always valuing money over humanity. Just know you're on the wrong side of the system. - It's funny you say that, seeing as how you so eagerly spearheaded the most murderous police force in the country. Legendary for its crimes and civil rights violations against people of color. Tell me, Beverly, if someone yells "black lives matter," what side of the line are you on? - That has nothing... - That has everything to do with it. So the next time you feel the need to lecture me on being on the right side of humanity, you might want to take a look in the mirror first. In the meantime, I'd like you to take the cuffs off my clients... Now. - Don't think we're finished with this dance, Hernandez. - That's fine with me. I love to dance. - Wrap it up. - Business affairs meeting, - 4:00, 4:30? - 4:00. - Great. We have points. They're ready. Management is inquiring. - Management is happy? - Absolutely. - Okay. - 1:30 lunch is pushed back. - No lunch. - You have to. - Coffee. - You look great. - Thank you. - There she is. The woman of the hour. What you did last night, exactly the reason I hired you. Come here, you beast, you. You know I handpicked you... Both: Right out of law school. - We all know the story, okay? You have told it a million times. - Well, now you're gonna have to hear it a million and one times. This is true, son, she could have landed anywhere, and I'm glad we got her. Not Greenwald. - Daniella. - Joshua. - Nice outfit. - Nice haircut. - Play nice, kids. We're all on the same team, right? Still don't know how you managed to save the neck of one client while simultaneously corralling in a new one, and not just any new one. The current number one hip-hop artist on the charts new one. You can't pay for publicity like that. Gotta tell you, son, Daniella is not making your bid to make partner any easier. In the time you've been with this firm, buildings are up almost 30%. You pumped new blood into this firm, which it desperately needed. It's the stuff partners are made of. - Well, Pops, not all of us have the advantage of alluring assets... To blindly attract hormonal young rappers. See some of us, Dad, we gotta rely on skill and hard work. - Work? - Yeah. - That's a word you know little about, Mr. Silver Spoon. Doesn't your dad still give you lunch money? Thankfully I don't need a hand-me-down partner position. I'll be earning my name on the door. - You have anything to add to that, Joshua? - Nope. - You're always one step ahead of the game. A toast to you. - Arnold. - Oh, just this once. You're more fun when you drink. - Thank you. - Okay, cheers. - Another hit artist. Larry, my friend I got to say, you have an eye for talent. - Well, it's a good thing I have an eye for something, 'cause God knows I'm losing my real vision among other things. Thank you, bro. - Oh Larry, you just can't do no wrong. - Thank you, Joshua, "I invented winning." - Daniella. - Daniella. - Look at you. Look at you. - Ah, Larry. - I swear to God, you get more beautiful every year. - And you look more rich. It's a funny thing. - Well, thanks to you. You're my go-to gal. - Aw, thank you, Larry. You've always believed in me. Even when I was just a rookie you gave me my first client. - I did, didn't I? - Mm-hmm. - Yes, yes, yes. Don't tell me. Don't tell me, um... Terry Jones. - I'll never forget. - Whatever happened to that guy? He was talented. - Drugs and alcohol. - We see that way too often these days, you know? - Yeah, just about as often as sexual harassment cases, Larry. - Ohhh. - How's your wife doing? - You had to ask. She's tired of my old ass, I'll tell ya. - Yeah, I bet she is. But no matter how much BS you put her through, you know she'll never leave you. - I wouldn't be so sure, and if she does you're first on my list. - Oh, we'll see about that. - Oh, hey, look! Here we go. Our guest of honor has arrived. - Isis. - Hello, Isis. - Congratulations, I'm so proud of you. - You know I couldn't have done it without my big sis. - Yes, you could have. You made this happen. - I know, you always remind me. - You're special, Isis. - I hate when you walk away from me like that, and you know I don't like you taking pictures without me. - Daniella, good to see you. - Good to see you too, Lewis. - Lewis, you're drunk and you're hurting me. - My bad, but you know I don't like all the attention on me. - Uh, let's all take time to congratulate our beautiful guest of honor for her triple-platinum album. Yeah! Triple platinum the first month. This girl is on fire. - ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Loving your forever, boy, I'm so down ♪ ♪ Spent my whole life with you, I'm ready ♪ ♪ When you want me down, boy, you go... ♪ - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, please... Please... please don't do this. Look, I'll tell you what you want. Just, please. Please, no-no-no-no. Look, I'll tell him whatever he wants, all right? Just please don't kill me, man, please. - Bring him up. What the deal, Connor? Or should I call you Lil Murda? - Man, come on, dog. Homie, look just... just tell Dom we good, all right? Just... just tell him we good. He can have the masters. - The master's not the problem. It's the people you got repping you, and they ain't budget on a percentage. I told you, Dom wanted 75%. - Man, I can't do 75, man. 75? Come on, man. That only leaves 25 for me and my whole crew, man. How am I supposed to eat with that? - Wrong answer. Drop him! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! All right, 75. 75 is good. 75. - Bring him up. - No, please, please! - You kidding me? - He slipped. - Yo, Dom. - Yo. - It's Matt. We got a problem, homie. - Fix it. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. D. - What's the urgency? - It's Isis. She was attacked last night at her house. It's all over the news and social media. - Attacked how? What happened? - It says right here, "Isis Ray was the apparent victim of an assault "that might've occurred at her home, "an exclusive gated community in Beverly Hills. She's been transported to a local hospital." - What? - It says, "Isis was found unconscious "by her assistant around 8:00 p.m., "Who then immediately alerted police. "Speculation is that Isis's longtime boyfriend "R&B singer Lewis Harper is responsible, "but so far authorities have not been able to determine his whereabouts." Oh, my God. - Find out what hospital. - On it. - Larry. - Oh, Daniella, thank you for coming. - Of course. How is she? - Well, the doctor said it was touch-and-go at first, but um, it seems like she's gonna pull through. - Oh, thank God. Are we allowed to see her? - Yes. Yeah, go ahead. Daniella... prepare yourself. - There are ligature marks around her wrist, which implies she was bound during the attack, and... apparently judging by the size of some of the bruises, doctors think that a blunt object was used. Like a stick or something. What kind of monster would do something like this? - She... she doesn't deserve to be in there. You know, she's really like a daughter to me. - I know. - You know, she was 12 when I discovered her. Even then she had a voice like Aretha. - Yes, she did. Sweetest little girl. I remember the day you brought her to me. Have the authorities said anything? - The authorities? Are you kidding me? No, not yet. Look, we both know who did this, Daniella. - I tried to tell her so many times. The boy is toxic. - Yeah, I know. I know. I told her to keep away from him. He has a rap sheet a mile long. - I never thought he'd do this. Have they brought him in for questioning? - He's in the wind. No one knows where he is. - I'll find him. He'll pay for it. - I'm counting on that, Daniella. - We'll reconvene in my office in 15. - Beverly, do you have a moment? - Daniella, you've got a lot of nerve showing up here after what you pulled the other night. I don't have time for your theatrics. - That's not why I'm here. I'm sure you've heard about the attack on Isis Ray. - Of course. - Isis is my client. I just want to know your office is doing about it. So now that the victim is your client, we're all just supposed to jump into action? - Beverly, she almost died. - True, she did. But if you ask me, it's just another sad example of the chickens coming home to roost. - Wow, that's cold-blooded. - Do you even care about all the victims who have actually died because of the people who are influenced by some of your client's lyrics? - My client's lyrics feed their families. They did what they had to. It's called survival. - No, selling drugs in the community is not survival... That is called murder. - Why don't you tell that to the people you work for? The same people who put the drugs on the street, to begin with. - When are you going to wake up, huh? You are so blinded by your own ambition. You can't even see you're surrounding yourself by the wrong people. - Why are you so concerned with who I hang out with? We're not in college anymore. Just tell me, are you intending to pursue charges against her boyfriend, Lewis Harper? - You know it's too early to tell. But I will say this... If Lewis is the perp, we'll most likely be looking at simple assault. - Are you serious? That's probation and a fine. The doctor's report said he used a weapon... - There wasn't a weapon found at the scene, and without a weapon or a statement from the victim, simple assault is the best I'll be able to do. - The best you'll be able to do? That's embarrassing. - Careful, Daniella. You're making this way too personal. It is not your job. It is mine. I'm trying to make a difference, and I thought you wanted to do the same. - I do, but to make a difference you first have to be different. Not play the game. You've gotta change it. That's true power. - True power? Power is really the only thing that you care about, but real power doesn't come easy. To change anything you have to work from the inside out. - You can't change anything from the inside if you're on the outside, Beverly. - Just be careful, Daniella. Don't get buried in your own city. - You don't have enough dirt. Miguel. - ♪ You kill me ♪ Bye. - Bye. Okay. I'm glad I see you smiling a little bit. Daniella, I'm so sorry. I know Isis is like a little sister to you. - Yeah. Girl, it just seems like this job gets harder and harder. - You make it look so easy. - It isn't. Sometimes I question why I do it. - Because it's your job, and you're damn good at it. - I just wish I could do more for Isis. - Come on now, D, you already do so much for everybody. Look at what you did for me. You took me in, and you trusted me when no one would even look my way, and now I can go to law school. You a hero to me. - Careful, Tamika, even heroes bleed. - Lewis Harper, age 27. Typical entertainer playboy. Started in the industry at the age of 17. Multiple DUIs, arrest for public intoxication, mischief, trespassing, verbal assault, minor drug offenses, and even urinating in public. And, oh yes let's not forget... The sex tape. - No, let's. - Nice presentation, Tamika, but I need more information than what you can Google. I need to know where he's been and what he's been doing since the assault. - The police sent a squad car to his residence. Nobody answered. This boy's disappeared. - He's too high profile to have just disappeared. Someone has to be helping him. I need you guys to dig deeper. You know what I mean. - You know that type of intel ain't our thing. Since you let Anthony go... - I didn't let Anthony go. He took another job. - None of that matters because we all know that kind of digging can only be done by an expert, so. - What about that new mailroom guy that Anthony recommended? - Bring him to me. - Colin Match. - March, yes. - Do you have a new trainee by the name of Steven Someone? - It's Sam Juan, not Someone. - My bad. So I take it you're him, Steven? - Yeah, that's me. - Good, come with me please. - What? Wait, wait. There must be some mistake. He's still in training. - He just finished. Have a good day, Mr. Match. This way, Steven. - It's March. It's March. It says March. - Am I getting fired? - No, just focus, observe, and don't talk too much. - Have a seat, Mr. Sam Juan. - Wow, you got it right. - I'll cut to the chase. I want to offer you a position on my team as a special digital researcher. - Digital researcher? - Full transparency: I want you to do some hacking for me. - Is this an Asian thing? - Are you serious? - Dude, that is so racist. You're stereotyping me. You think that I can hack just because I'm Asian? What, you heard about the new Oriental dude working in the mailroom? - Steven Sam Juan, age 27. Last four of your social, 3429. You still live in your parents' basement. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, so you pulled my resume. - Not just your resume. Because I know why you still live with your parents. You hacked the United States Federal Reserve in record time at age 15. The problem is you got caught, went to juvie. - How... those records are supposed to be sealed. - I'm sure you were just a kid having fun, but now your parents are in debt because of it. - What, are you blackmailing me or something? - This is Hollywood, Sam Juan. People come here from all over the world to become celebrities, but... fame is nothing compared to power. - Mm. - Power is gained many ways. One is through the knowledge of secrets. Everyone has them. The lucky few take them to their grave. The rest would kill to keep them. That's what makes them valuable. Secrets are currency to me, Sam Juan. - So you want me to hack into people's personal info to get you "currency?" - You're quick. - Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it. If the feds found out I was hacking again, I'll be finished. I'm not risking that for you or for nobody. - My previous tech guy was Anthony Rice. His hacker moniker was Hannibal... - The Carthaginian? Yo, are you serious? That dude's on the Mount Rushmore of hackers. Where's he now? - Working for the NSA. - Listen, as insanely cool as this is, I still don't think I can do it. - Look, Sam Juan... - Can you call me Steven? - No, sit down. I understand your hesitance. You're scared you'll get caught again, and you want to do right by your parents, which is why you took this job to begin with. Well, that and your father's rising medical bills. - Okay, can you stop doing that, please? It's a little creepy that you know everything about me. - My professional advice here is that you should never turn down an offer until you see the proposed compensation. - Are you serious? - You could get your parents out of debt in no time, and I can promise you that I'll protect you and your family from anything we do here. What do you say, Sam Juan? - I say you should've definitely started with this. - Is that a yes? - That's a yes. - Good. - Get to work. - Yes, Ms. Hernandez. - Thank you, Tamika. - You're welcome. - I need you to check the private airfields. They have a couple of pilot friends, right? - Yeah, we've narrowed it down to two. - I have the last cell tower was Lewis pinged and all the numbers he called within the last 48 hours. - This is it? He should be in a panic right now calling everyone he knows. - Unless your boy got a burner. - All right, I need you to figure out which one of these numbers is his mother's. Trace it and if he does have a burner, the new number should show up there. - Help me out. What exactly are we doing here? - Meaning? - I mean, this is an entertainment law firm, right? Don't you just do contract negotiations and stuff? Shouldn't we leave this for the cops? Like, why are we getting involved in this case? - Have a seat, Sam Juan. We're getting involved because I know how the law works and doesn't work. I'm doing this because, with the right team of lawyers, right publicity, and right crooked judge, Lewis would get off scot-free and sue Isis for defamation of character. I'm doing this because Isis is my client, and more importantly she's my friend. So you and I need to get something clear. If in the future you're curious as to why we're doing something, the simple answer is because I told you to. - You need anything else from me tonight? - No thanks, Miguel. - Good night, ma'am. - Night. - Gabriella. - Good night, Miguel. You look just like your mother when she would come back from the studio so tired. She was a workaholic just like you. Don't be like her. - I don't know how else to be. - You need to be your own woman. I keep telling you that it's not healthy for you to live in the same house as your mother. I think you need to sell it. This is not good for you. Too many goals. There's only so much sage I can burn. - I'm never gonna sell it. You know that. It's the only way I feel close to her. - Don't forget your father lived here too. Not openly, but he was here more than he was with his own family. He cared so much about your mother he bought this house cash so the two of you would always have it. - Which is why I'm not leaving. This house is all I have. It's hard being without them. Barely having a memory. I didn't even know who my father was until a few years ago. All I know is I was a secret... a mistake. - How many times do I have to tell you that you were not a mistake? Would your father's life have been ruined if they would have known about you? Yes. But believe me, he loved you so much. He always called you his little angel. You always tell me that. Just wish I could remember it. That I could remember anything. - And I got you on my mind ♪ ♪ Got me holding on ♪ ♪ Till the love is gone ♪ ♪ There's nobody love me better ♪ ♪ Summer's gone ♪ ♪ And I ♪ ♪ Love you better ♪ ♪ When the sun shines ♪ ♪ Butterflies rise on my soul ♪ ♪ You know I ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ We've both been wrong ♪ ♪ But I know we can do better ♪ ♪ If the weather ♪ ♪ It never change ♪ ♪ When summer's gone ♪ ♪ And winter comes ♪ ♪ The rain starts ♪ ♪ And everything goes wrong ♪ ♪ We can do better ♪ - You've got to be kidding me. - Were you trying to wake the neighbors? - Where is he? - Hello to you too, Daniella. - Is he here? - Who?

Nothing's official yet. - And you just failed to mention that to me? - Nothing's in ink. - You don't know what he did to her. - Yeah, allegedly. - Allegedly? Oh, is that the advice you're going to give your client? - No, no, no, no, no. - Just deny it all? - Don't tell me how to do my job. - You didn't see her in the hospital. Her jaw is wired shut. Her face is cut and bruised. She's barely recognizable, but I guess that doesn't matter to you because you've got your new client. Congratulations. - Just wait. Wait. Stop, just listen! You're right. I should have told you at the office. - Yeah, you should have. - Yeah. Yeah. - Do you know where he is? - No, Daniella. - Are you telling me the truth? - Yes, trust me.

Hip hop royalty rapper Connor Hanks known as Lil Murda has been reported dead. His death has been ruled a suicide. Authorities say there was no foul play involved. Connor was 31 years old with a promising career, currently holding a top 10 chart spot for three weeks in a row with his latest single. Sources say that Hanks was in talks with hip hop mogul Big Dom's label. The deal was said to be worth millions. - Tell me you didn't do this. - What's up, D? - I'm looking for Dom. - Oh, I'll bring you to him. Dom, D's here to see you. - Yo, cut. - It was good seeing you. - Goo to see you too, Bella. - I'ma go handle this for you. - Appreciate you. - I'ma hold it down for you, man. - All right, good. - Ladies. - How you doing, Dom? - Life is Gucci. Getting them bags. Now you know you the baddest chick on the planet, right? - Well, I'm sure your wife Bella would disagree. - There you go, you know she ain't my wife. - And you know why I'm here. Tell me you didn't do it. - Do what? - Dom, don't play me like I'm everyone else. - First of all, I would never play you, D. Second, I don't know what you mean. - You don't know what I mean? - No. - Connor Hanks? You know he's my client. I find it really hard to believe that a young white kid at the top of his game would just suddenly commit suicide. - And you think I had something to do with this? Look, I wouldn't lie to you. - If I find out... - You won't. Now, what's up? Can a nigga get some love? A smile or something? Damn. There it is. That's what I like to see. I know you sad. Sorry to hear about your girl Isis. - Yeah, well, I'm looking for Lewis. - Hm. - You wouldn't happen to know where he is? - No, nothing yet. But if you want, I could put some of my people on him for you. - Okay, that would help, but nothing illicit. Just let me know where he is, okay? - Consider it done. - Okay. - You know I'ma want a favor in return, right? What? - I want you to represent me again. Greenwald and them been cool, D, but they ain't you. Ain't nobody you. - I'll think about it. - I'll be thinking about you. Yo, let's get back to work. - Wow, two nights in a row, huh? - ♪ Baby, I know you know ♪ ♪ You're my way for sure ♪ ♪ If you want ♪ - Angela. Angela. Angela! Angela. - Daddy. - Angela. - Daddy. - Hey, whoa, whoa. Another nightmare? - Yeah. - You gonna tell me what it's about this time? - You don't want to know. - Come on, Daniella, I'm not gonna hurt you. - I just... I just... I just keep having these dreams, but they're more like visions. - What do you mean "visions?" - Like, visions of what happened the night my parents died. Like, it wasn't just a car accident. - You know what happened. Your dad was found with drugs and alcohol in his system. The car spun out of control and... and that's it. Okay, and I know you want to believe there's more to this story but, baby, sometimes there just isn't. - I know that's the story, but I don't know if that's the truth. Everyone I've ever talked to about my dad said they don't remember him drinking or doing drugs. - I mean... We all have secrets, right? You're the one who told me that. I mean, look at us right now. - Yeah. - And you were so little. I mean, what do you actually remember? - Well, that's just the thing. I wasn't in the car, right? But in my dream, I'm in the backseat. I can see everything. - Well, it's definitely a dream. Because if you'd been in that car, you wouldn't even be here right now. - Yeah, I know. It just... It feels so real. - I bet. It's okay. - It's probably all in my head. Just forget I said anything, okay? I gotta go. - No you don't. Why don't you just stay the night tonight? Look, nobody knows you're here. - Hey. - Yeah. - If you hear from Lewis, promise you'll call? - Yes. - Thank you. It was fun. - Yeah. No, she just left. I think she may know something. - Lang & Associates, Daniella Hernandez's office. Uh-huh. Who am I speaking to? Yo, are you serious? Yeah, sure man. I'll tell her you downstairs. All right, cool. - So the phone number led to a dead end. We need to double our efforts to find Lewis. - Good morning. - You're late. - I'm actually 15 minutes early, and I'm doing your job answering your phone calls. - What phone calls? - That was Big Dom. He said he was outside, and he wanted to stop in. - What?! What did you tell him? - Of course I said sure. I mean, that's Big Dom. - Oscar and Lil Ag's meeting is in five minutes. They're probably downstairs in our lobby right now. - You just made sure the two biggest rivals in hip hop are about to meet in our lobby together at the same time. - We got the number one spot. - If I want Ag, I'll take him from you. - You got a problem with Dom, you got a problem with me. - Stop! Hey! Stop! You're not doing this here. Look around you. I don't care who rolled up on who. It's done now. I swear I'll drop both of you as clients. Tamika, take Oscar and Lil Ag to the conference room to sign the conflict and fee agreements. - Let's go. Let's go, now. - You come with me. - You good, need me to roll? - Hold it down till I get back. I got D. - Yeah, yeah. - What are you doing here? - I appreciate you agreeing to take me back as a client. I missed you. - I never said I'd take you back, and you showing up here unannounced is not helping your case at all. - That's what I always loved about you, D. You still got that fire, the way you handled everybody down there in the lobby. Now, you know, I ain't never listened to nobody but you. - Dom, stop. It's business. - Okay, then let's talk business. I know you think I should leave the streets alone, D, but the streets is what got me where I am. - Yeah. - I just got offered a new distribution deal for 50 mil. I have three platinum artists and counting. They all have priors. That's why I need you. - I appreciate that, Dom, but if you and I are ever gonna work together again, you have to promise me that everything's gonna be done legit. I can't let you put me in that position again. - Of course, I can't erase the past. I'm worried about your girl, the DA chick. - Yeah, you should be. Beverly's relentless and she has too much power now. If she finds even the slightest bit of evidence that you're using illicit funds to finance your label, she'll stop at nothing to shut you down. - You and me both know I'ma always be a real one, but I'll lay low. As for your man Oscar, you need to tell him to stay out of my way for him and Ag's safety. Already been nice enough letting him use my studio, but they need to be grateful. - This is exactly what I'm talking about, Dom, keep me out of your street business. Don't worry about what I do for Oscar and Lil Ag; that's my business. - All right. - Arnold. I hope you don't mind. - No, of course. No problem. Dom, how's the man of the year? - Living one day at a time, pimp. What's popping with you? - Oh, you know, business as usual. Hey, congrats on Sabrina going platinum. You're on top of the world, Dom. - It's a hell of a view. - So let's do lunch next week. - For sure. - Well, since we're all here, can we talk business? - Sure. I hear you're coming back to the family. - It looks like it, but I wanted to discuss it with you first. - Come on, Daniella, if it were up to me he never would have left in the first place. Greenwald is not Lang & Associates. They don't have anybody like Daniella over there, do they? - Agreed. So it sounds like the prodigal son returns. Now let's get this paper, huh? - Dom's happy, everybody's happy. I'll let you two guys finish up. - All right. - Thank you, Arnold. - Well, as much as I love playing catch-up with you, I have to get back to work. I'll have Tamika send over the retainer agreement this afternoon. - The hospital just called. - If I didn't get it, it didn't happen. I want the report on my desk by end of day today. - Bev, I got the financials on Dom and Oscar. Now we do know that they are a bunch of criminals that are trying to wash their dirty money, but we can't prove that that money's being used to fund the labels. - Well without any hard evidence, we can't do a damn thing against Dom or Oscar. But I will find a way to take them down. I'll be damned if I let those thugs continue to hide behind their drug money. - Well look, Lewis, he's an easier case to make. I say we just got to find him. - We'll find him. We just need to make sure we do before Daniella does. - I'm on it. - I'm going to the hospital to check on Isis. - What are you doing here? - I'll meet you downstairs. My job. - Oh, so now you want to do your job. - I know you're looking for Lewis, but you are not the prosecutor. So if you find him, turn him in, Daniella. No games this time. Don't make me arrest you for obstruction. - Don't try to stop a train you can't even slow down. - Legally I can, actually. All I need is a reason, and you are so close to giving me one. - Yeah, I'd like to see you try. - You know, the rest of the world might buy this whole untouchable tough girl act, but you and I both know you're just a scared little girl with daddy issues trying to fix everyone else 'cause you can't fix yourself. - Is she okay? - She's gonna be fine. - Oh, my God. It is so good to see your eyes open. We missed you. Your fans are gonna be so happy to hear your voice again. I'm so sorry. Forgive me, but I have to ask you what happened. Time's not on our side. If you could just tell me a little bit about what happened or even just tell me what weapon he used, we could pursue serious charges against Lewis. I know you can hear me. Isis, please. Why won't she look at me? - This is common with patients who've experienced her level of trauma. - Do you mind leaving us alone? - Sure. - I can't imagine what you must be thinking right now. How you must be feeling. I know you're probably still in love with Lewis. I understand. But you can't let him get away with this. You have to tell me what happened. - Pictures. - Hm? - Get the pictures. - The nurse said she regained consciousness? Isis. Isis? What's wrong? She's going to be okay. That's what the nurse said. But um... look, I got to go, okay? - Okay. - I'll be back. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. - Good to see you. - Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Tamika. - Yeah. - I need you to pay Lewis's financial advisor a visit. His name is Gilbert Rice. Tell Sam Juan to come up with some dirt to make him cooperate. We need to figure out where Lewis is spending his money. - How's that for an asset? - Also see if Sam Juan can access the gated community security footage. - Okay. - Maybe we'll get an image of Lewis leaving the complex. - Actually, Steven just found something for you. Apparently Lewis had a sealed domestic abuse case filed against him about eight years ago. - Do you have a name? - Better. We have an address. - My name is Daniella Hernandez. I'm Isis Ray's attorney. I want to talk to you about an assault case you filed eight years ago. - Look, my husband will be home soon... - I'll be quick. - And I've got a lot of things... - I just have a few questions. - I don't think that I can answer your questions because I signed an NDA when we settled. - I understand, but you heard about what happened to Isis, right? I just need to know what happened to you. - I'm sorry. I can't... I can't help you. - It will help me, Veronica, please. Isis in shock. She'll need months to recuperate. We need to find Lewis now. - My husband doesn't know about the case. - Answer my questions, and it will stay that way. - Oh, okay. I was young. I wanted to be a singer. I wanted the spotlight. Or so thought. And, um... I, you know, put myself out there. - Don't blame yourself. You're the victim. - Yeah, that's the thing. I wasn't. Like I said, I was young and ambitious and I really, really wanted the attention so bad. So I snuck into a party, and, um... I got close to him. I threw myself at him. And, uh... he took me in this room. I didn't know he'd do what he did. But that was the night I met Lewis. - Wait. Weren't you just talking about Lewis? Isn't Lewis the one that did those things to you? - He never touched me. - Who assaulted you? - I can't tell you. I can't say. Look, I could lose everything... everything. And I just... I can't risk it. He took pictures. He took pictures, and he said that he would send them to my entire family if I ever said anything. - Who? Who took the pictures? - I can't... I can't tell you. But what I can say is, me and Isis weren't the only ones. - What do you mean? - I can't say. Look, I already said too much. I need... I need you to go. My husband is on his way home. Please, you have to go. Please. - Okay. If you change your mind, you have my card. - Stop. Turn around. You'll do. Get in. - Hi, Gilbert. - How'd you get in here? - Security let us in. - Do I know you? - No, but I brought you a gift. - Wait... what are you doing? What are you doing? - I need some information on Lewis Harper's recent financial activity. I just would like for you to step away from your computer for a short time while leaving it logged in to a specific account. Or I could just forward these pictures to your wife. - Any updates? - Yes, I checked the gated community security footage like you asked, but It's been erased, and the security guard that was on duty that night has quit too. - And Lewis's account hasn't moved since the night of the assault, but I did find a couple of recent substantial advances that recently popped into his account, and you won't believe from who. - I don't believe this. Been there before. Mm-hmm. - Oh, shit. - Sit down, Lewis. - Uh... so how'd you find me? - It wasn't easy. - So what now, are the police outside waiting on me? - No, there's no police. - Oh, or the paparazzi out there waiting to get exclusive shots at a singer/woman beater. - No, just me and Miguel, my driver. - Then what is it that you want? - I want to hear you say it. - Say what? - What you did. - Tell me. - I got angry. I was controlling. I hit her. - No, no you didn't. But for some reason, you're willing to take the fall for the person who did. Why? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Lewis, I already know who did it. We're standing in his house right now, aren't we? Why are you covering for him? What in the world did he promise you? - Look, you're a big-time lawyer and all, but you don't understand what this business is like for guys like me. What men of power can really get away with. My label dropped me six months ago. I needed help, and he can take me where I need to be. He promised me that he'd have it fixed that I get charged with just a misdemeanor. Probation if anything. He said, "The public is more forgiving of a artist." He promised me hits. Put me back on top. - Did he make those promises before or after he attacked Isis? - After. - Lewis, you're a bad liar. - He's good at making big promises. That's how he works. That must be how he got to Isis again. - Are you saying he's done this to ISIS before? - Yeah, but not as bad. This time he lost control. - Like he did with Veronica? - Yeah. - You just let him use you to cover up what he did to her? - How do you think I got my first Grammy? - So you've sacrificed your soul for fame? - At first, but it started to get out of hand. I didn't know what to do with myself. I'm starting not to even like myself anymore. It's why I stay high. Look, I feel really bad about what happened to Isis. She's a good girl, and I told him... I told him if he ever put his hands on her again, I'd killed his ass myself. - Tough words for a fall guy. But will you stand up and tell the world what he did? - Of course not. You know I can't do that, and even if I did, nobody would believe me anyway. He's untouchable. - Not to me. You gotta get your life together, Lewis. - Is Isis gonna be okay? The news not saying much. - She's awake, but she'll never be okay again. - Look, it's bigger than him. He's not the only one. You gotta be safe. - Thank you. - Now what? - I don't know. Can't prove anything. It's all circumstantial. - Angela. Angela. Angela! Angela. - Daddy. - Angela. - Daddy. - He sacrificed enough. Don't harm the girl. - Angela. - ♪ Summer days are gone ♪ ♪ And I got you on my mind ♪ ♪ Got me holding on ♪ ♪ Till the love is gone ♪ ♪ 'Cause nobody love me better ♪ ♪ Summer's gone ♪ ♪ And I... ♪ - You've been a daughter to me ever since your parents died, and I have to tell you, I'm worried about you, mi amor. Is it the nightmare? - Yeah, that and work. - Did you pray about it? - No, Tia, I haven't prayed about it. - You too good to pray now? - Never too good to pray. I just forgot. There's been a lot on my mind. - You need to pray more and worry less. You've always been such a worrywart. Always trying to solve everyone else's problems. - Because I can't solve my own. - Which is why you took this life. To help people. Because this is what you do best. You need to take care of yourself now. This job has become your life. What does it matter if you have money and power, but no love, no peace in your heart? No, you can't sacrifice that. - I know. Maybe... Maybe I've made power too important. Maybe I've been so blinded by my own ambition, I can't see that I'm playing for the wrong team. - No, mi hija, you're good at what you do, and you fight for what you believe in. And there's never anything wrong with that. - What if I help bad men? - Bad men were once good boys, and sometimes they need help too. - Sometimes, but not this time. This one needs to pay for what he did. But it's complicated. I... just can't figure it out. - Your mother used to say that whenever she had a huge problem, she'd form pictures in her mind of what her life would look like if the problem was solved. She would keep those images in her mind, focus on them, pull them in closer and closer, until those pictures became her reality. - The pictures, of course. Thank you, Tia. Sam Juan, yeah, it's me. I need you to meet me an hour early tomorrow, okay? Okay, so Isis and Veronica both said he took photos. That means there's got to be copies somewhere. A guy like this is gonna want to look at them. My guess is, it's on a personal computer somewhere. - I can hack that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You'll be able to find the photos? - Yeah, it's probably on an encrypted file. All I need is a home address. Once I get that, I can hack the IP address to every computer inside the home. - Every computer? - And laptop. If there's any information, files, pictures, statements, anything on any of those computers you can have in... less than an hour? - Good. Tamika, give him the address. - On it. - Sam Juan, find me those photos. - Easy. - Thank you for joining us, and we're going to jump right in with breaking news. This morning we've obtained pictures showing multi-Grammy award winner and music mogul Larry Stilwell in some very troubling situations. We have also learned that these pictures were anonymously sent to the Los Angeles police department at the DA's office. Pictures that are too graphic for us to air, but show the producer engaging in sexual acts... - I can't believe this. I'm being set up. - That can only be described as sadomasochistic rape... - Isis was like a daughter to me. - Dating back for years. Authorities are still working to identify the victims, and we are withholding their names to protect their identities, but we can say that among the photos are graphic images of the assault of Isis Ray who has been in intensive care for the last week. - It's me. Get rid of them both... now. - Police, open up! We have a warrant for your arrest. - Drop the gun, now! - Tamika. - D. She's gone. I'm sorry. - Come here. It's okay. It's okay, I got you. - I almost did it. - But you didn't, all right? I missed you. I missed you so much. Mm. Good morning, beautiful. - Morning. - Last night was amazing. Why are you leaving? - I got work. - Yeah, I wish you could stay. - I want to see you again. - You have a woman, and she's a crazy one. - You know I'd leave her crazy ass for you. - Please don't. - Why, are you seeing somebody? - No. - Then you know I've been feeling you since day one. You get me. You know I'm a beast out there, but for you I want to be better. - Dom, you're a bad boy. - Don't good girls fall for bad boys? - Who said I was a good girl? Bye. Thank you. - Good news. Your boy Lil Ag just got picked up on aggravated assault. Think we can make it stick? - I'll make sure it does. How'd you get the warrant? - Stan. - Good. - All right. - This may not be my business, but, um, what's the beef with you and Daniella? - There's no beef. Daniella just needs to know she's not above the law, and that we're going to be taking down these criminals that she calls clients. - Sounds good. Well, I just want to make sure that we have everything lined up. We don't want anything to backfire on us if we don't. - It's your job to make sure it doesn't. - I always do my job. - Good. Now we have a funeral to go to. - Still haven't seen you in a while. I miss you. - Not here. - Can I see you later? - We'll see. - Daniella. - Beverly. - Look, I know we've had our differences, but I am truly sorry for your loss. You know this music entertainment industry BS can really take you down if you let it. - You're unbelievable. Listen, I love my job, and I'm good at it. You love your job, and you're a bully at it. I think it's best we stay out of each other's way. - No, see, I think we're the same beast. We both do whatever it takes by any means necessary. - Hm. Yeah, sure. But there's one big difference, I'm not trying to take people down just because they want to follow their dreams. - Oh, I'm just trying to help. - You can help by staying away from my clients and I. What is this? - It's an indictment against Lil Ag for aggravated assault and attempted murder against his engineer Craig Cooper. - So this is how you're trying to help? - We picked him up an hour ago. He won't be getting out this time. - You're going to wish you never met me. - Oh, Daniella, I'm not the enemy. One day you'll see that. You'll choose the good guys. I just hope that when you do, it's not too late. I'll see you in court. - Daniella... what was that all about? - They arrested Lil Ag. - That lady never gives up, does she? - She will when she realizes she can't win. - This thing is so unfortunate. You know I... I've known Larry for decades. And I heard stories that he was into some kinky stuff but never imagined this. The worst part... this firm lost a $10 million client. - Two lives have been lost. I'll be happy to see Larry behind bars. I hope he rots there. - Let's just say it's a terrible loss for the families and the firm. - I don't see it that way. Larry's connection to our firm is a liability. Once our reputation is lost, you can't buy it back. - Spoken like a true partner. - Thank you. - I know you were behind the leak. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You're one hell of a lady, Hernandez. I feel sorry for the poor soul who gets on your bad side. I know you think you were doing the right thing, but when it comes to my clients, don't ever pull anything like that again. Or you're going to go head-to-head with this bull, understand? - I understand. - Okay. - Oh, Arnold, one more thing. I want to file two wrongful death suits against Larry. I know he was behind Isis' and Lewis' death. They were also clients. - Come on, Daniella, don't you think the poor bastard has sacrificed enough? Sacrificed enough, sacrificed enough? He's sacrificed enough. Don't harm the girl. - Come on, Daniella, don't you think the poor bastard has sacrificed enough?
