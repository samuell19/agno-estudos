A premonition That dream was like a premonition my intuition was telling me … That I shouldn't go to school that day. The best thing to do... was to stay home to watch the Tour de France live I was sure mom would understand... but just in case, I had a great excuse. Get out of bed Mister. it's getting late. And if they call me from school again I'll ask your dad to go himself to the principal office. You hear me? Mom… my belly hurts a lot… I have a fever... Hot flushes... What an Actor! I deserve an Oscar! I think I'm infected with the menopause. That virus was, according to my Aunt, ... going around our family. Well, you're not staying here to watch T.V… I said up, quickly! Breakfast is ready. Parra moves ahead... the colombian is getting away... the spaniard can't reach him. Parra, the colombian, is leader of this stage... Two consecutive stages won, one after the other... Lucho Herrera's win yesterday, and Parra's today... it's for me... tell Lucho I'm coming The winner of the race could be a Colombian that will make the second win in a row… Have you found anything out? The Colonel has not come out of his quarters. Have you seen any women around? Good In 1985, the national team victories in the tour de France… made Cycling more popular than Football in the whole country And of course, my school wasn't the exception. Riding a bicycle was the new craze there too. As for me, I was a very independent thinker never got influenced by trends, cool stuff or advertising tricks Hey cousin! Hi cuz is that your new bike? Yeah, brought straight from Paris. It's sweet, can I ride it? No ahhhh what if you fall and break it?! Well I'll give you mine then. Nah cousin, yours is so old and broken -We'll remind all students that the sign up list for the talent show will be closing today at Mr. Cardona music room Singing in public? No way jose... I'm not that crazy! who the heck would be so dumb to volunteer… to be made fun of in front of the whole school. Hey cuz, are you also signing up? Also? Also? Yep! I have my act prepared… … and with this jacket I'll be the most original of all. Super Original! Alright there Cousin to begin with… Michael Jackson is not white and… he never will be… Never! Besides, You're way too pale… to look like him… Whatever I have my act ready and you could compete too. C'mon Cuz, be realistic I decided to be a cyclist. Professional Cyclist … or be the MVP of a big football team. Winner of a World Cup … my third backup plan: commander of the first space shuttle to mars… You know what? It's your loss… Mr. Cardona has a big T.V. and after practice he'll let us watch … whatever we want. now hold on… Mr. Dumbo-Ears with… … a Big T.V. screen… ten in the morning… ...The Tour de France… Wait up Cuz! So how do I sign up? Be quiet kids Since we're going to be on break I will assign the biology project. It consists of the germination of a bean. You will grab a jar fill it up with water cover it with cotton and place the bean on top. Then write a report for the whole process oh yeah, Also.. the kids performing on the talent show can go to Mr. Cardona's music room. ... he will be waiting at ten o' clock ... remember you should have a song ready for rehearsal hey Pelvis, Elvis Pelvis Sing us a song sing Pelvis Fat Elvis! not, better Fat Pelvis! Move your Pelvis, Elvis Epidermis! here comes again.... all the jokes it was my mom's fault… She insisted in naming me Elvis... and I hated it I would rather be named Rambo Steven Vandame… like my dad wanted How great Elvis Antonio! You're in the talent show? A little white lie never hurt no one... No, no... I just need to go to the restroom. Go ahead but don't take long. Detective - - Lawyer In my school, the music class was full of nerdy unpopular kids ... so I need to sneak out pretty quickly to keep my good reputation ... or whatever was left of it but to watch the race live on T.V. … worthed the risk Just as we say in the professional field this operative spilled positive results. So... Did you find out the name of the woman? well… mmm… it's ahh--- it's not just really one... You're telling me, several women? I'm sorry... I can't tell you that You know... our job has a high labor cost... ...in man-hours. but in this envelope... I have all the photographs Are we good? or you want to count it first? How dare you say that? Darling, I trust you completely. I suppose it is worse... than you imagined. Would you like to have a drink? to kill the pain… When a door closes... another one opens, sweetie Would you shut your mouth please? Cousin… Cousin! Come here! Hurry up! Move! What's going on? Where is the T.V.? It's in the utilities room but Mr. Cardona won't let us watch until practice is over. They are almost there, 150 meters from the finish line. flags everywhere, people moving around… Fabio Parra and Lucho Herrera, 100 meters from the finish line. Come on! Faster… Lucho.. Watching that race was the most exciting moment in my life… Yes… Yes, We Won.. Yeah!! ....And it lasted just five seconds… Elvis! What are you doing in here?! why are you outside your classroom? Uh-oh... This is not your classroom! Tell me, What are you doing here? here comes the peloton... racing to the finish line 25 ... 26.. 27 second behind... they arrived, lead by Matt Mariott This is quite a serious situation young man I cannot believe this, Elvis How could you walk out of class to go watch T.V. Good Lord. I did not skip class. Technically... I didn't I went out to go to the talent show practice. But Mr. Cardona says you didn't even sign up. Well I changed my mind after seeing so much talent in there… That means you're not going to participate. No human power... could make me to go up on that stage... since you're not going to participate in the show, that means you walk out of class to watch the T.V. I will have to send you home and you'll be suspended for the week. Thank you, thank you, thank you! No. No, Dear Principal. You cannot suspend him because he will participate in the talent show. Am I right? No mommy! I don't have a good ear for music like Mr. Cardona. Elvis Antonio! How rude… Good Lord. But mommy, I'm not making fun of my teacher's ears. No, really! Enough! I can't sing in front of the whole school! I'm not a nerd. Time to use logic to persuade my mom And what's dad gonna say about this? He hates all kinds of singers and artists. And I don't even know how to dance. What about my rhinitis, huh? I won't be able to sing nice. but I'm keeping my dignity and I won't beg, Mother Mom please forgive me! I will never skip class again. and I'll start with the science homework right now. I promise I won't do it again... I don't want to dance... I didn't know what my mom was planning.. but looking at the souvenirs from her honeymoon calmed her down quite a bit she kept them in the attic ...where they hid the stuff they didn't want me to see not knowing I had already seen it My dad took my mom to Vegas for her wedding gift they had a great time... wasted a lot of money... took a bunch of photos... but the dummy lost the photos, and now they don't speak about it at home at all… it was the first time I saw that jewelry box it was the first time I saw my mom so excited for an object oh no!... Elvis Presley, my karma gee, how ugly... they used to dress back then I shouldn't have gone to school today now I'm paying the price for it. Nothing that can't be fixed with some needle and thread nothing that can't be fixed by running way from here You look so cute on... ...that bellbottom jumpsuit and that collar! No… Please mother, no pictures… no pictures …I said, no pictures… Ready Elvis? no pictures mom! see? You know what's coming now? We're going to dance! Where are you going? no mother… I don't want to this... I don't ! this is old farts music well... Keep on practicing. I'll be right back. practice this? I'm growing old already! No way! I don't want to do this What's this? ... WHAT IS THIS?!!!! Control that foot, Elvis, stop moving your feet! You don't like this music… This is not your style Stay Still Stop! ...you can't do this in public… ...or worse, in front of the whole school… NO!!!! … but alone, in my room... it was different... the rhythm was contagious... I was even having fun… ... and for an instant… just for a very short instant... I closed my eyes and… I began to enjoy it..... Where did you get this music from? Huh?! You're getting all fruity or what?! I've never seen my dad so mad Look at yourself! when a parent is like that you have to stare at the chin. All this bullshit is not for men! you understand? so you don't laugh what is wrong with you Alfredo? You can't just come home... and let off your frustrations on the kid! You understand me? Well, That's just perfect, keep on spoiling him like that and watch how he's going to end up. You know what I think? That you and that catholic school... are going to turn my son into a faggot! Who do you think you are? gosh... You don't have the moral authority ... to give this kind of orders in this home Answer me! I don't want faggots in my house. Now you listen to me! From tomorrow on, you will be going to the military academy. same school where the president´s and the Minister of defense's kids go. You understand me now? So it's just about that, right? Only about your career, isn't it? It's always about it. You used my dad, then you used me. Now you're using the kid! Shame on you! for all the low stuff you've done. You hear me? I did not force you to marry me. You married me because you wanted it so! You always.... Always! do whatever the hell you please! Yes, if I married you, it was because I needed a real man. I only want you to be a good mother To be a good housewife, but no! You think I'm dumb? You think I don't remember things well? At that moment... … I didn't know where to go... … I just wanted to be ... ...as far as I could from home... …To go as fast as I could on my bike… that's when I found out... that life could change in just a blink of an eye twelve year old boy with polytrauma Doctor! We have a twelve year old... ... polytraumatized patient. he has bruises and scrapes His vital signs are stable. Nurse, let's prepare for D.R.E. … And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse… Dr. BigFinger decided to do a final test If I had felt what he was doing to me…. ...I would've ran far away from that hospital Well the good news are that your son has no fractures in the region. but it's just an inflammation right? So.... Could we just take him home now? I don't know well… But can he go back to school for example? It may be too soon to say that. We'd have to wait at least two months and observe his development. See if there are any complications. Now hold on for a moment, complications? The thing is... ... that from the bellybutton down, the boy can't feel anything. At least for now. Oh no. Doctor is... is there anything that can be done? Well you can put this in the front of the car. For convenience I mean. You can park closer it will be easier to carry him. and If you have any problems with the permit... As if the police stops you for anything you can call me. Here is my number. I'm available for you twenty-four seven. Be assured I will call you doctor. Nop you can better arrange that with my secretary. my secretary. Thank you. After my first prostate exam... The rest of the exams were less intrusive... I would say... probably more safer too. As my doctor used to say... a little bit of radiation once in a while... ...can't hurt anyone Well he stopped saying it two years later when he started losing his hair You want to go out for a bit? C'mon my love, why not? We can go out and you try the wheelchair, and we can see how you do, huh? I don't want to get on that thing. Look, Elvis! Lucho Herrera is the leader! See that? But he rides a different bicycle with the wheels in front and back, not side to side Look it's your cousin! Look who's here! Your aunt and your cousin! Hi love! Hi auntie Go ahead love place that right there. How are you feeling? I'm okay. My dear... Stay here and watch some T.V. with your cousin for a bit… While we go grab a coffee, alright? This wheelchair is sweet! no... I don't want to leave Elvis alone You cannot break down like that in front of the kid. You have to stay strong, ok? He spends hours and hours in front of that window… As if he wanted to jump... I don't know what to say Janeth... I'm going to leave Alfredo. But why? He's in the Army A military man like dad. Hey Cuz, look Lucho Herrera fell down! Does it hurt? Nah. I don't feel a thing. It's only uncomfortable. Unconfortable? Yeah, they treat you like a…. Like a cripple? Ladys and Gentleman... my cousin... the diplomat Like a baby... That they treat you like a baby. They feed me like a baby... They give me baths like a baby. They even change me into a diaper like a baby… But, there are good things also. come... closer... One of the nurses... ...is so pretty. And I speak to her very quietly. So she has to get close to me. then, I can see her boobs Ohhhhh ... I also have a special plate. and anything you put inside of it, tastes like roasted chicken. Now that, I don't believe you. Seriously! Look, it's right over there. It looks so strange. Well, it has that shape to retain the flavor. Why is it dirty? That's because I've used it already. C'mon, pour some juice in and give it a try. I didn't know if my cousin was that silly, gullible or so dumb… … Or if he simply wanted to give me a good laugh… Try it. when Elvis gets off the hospital, we'll stay at mom's house for a couple of weeks. You want me to take Sebas there? yes? I'll take him when he gets off school so he can be with Elvis. What do you think? Alright, thank you. Sebastian! Elvis Antonio! You crazy one. How's my favorite artist doing? Waiting for you my love! I'm okay. What did you say my little prince? I didn't hear you very well. I wish I were that mole… I'm doing okay. Since my boy doesn't want to ride the wheelchair yet.. And well there is nobody to take him to the bathroom at night… We're going to have to put on his little diaper. Nothing like motherly intrusion to kill such a romantic moment. Mom, not now... Don't worry doll, I won't tell anybody. Noooo! Hey son, how're you doing? He can't speak to you right now. Don't you see we're getting him ready for bed? Alright, but what do the doctors say? Is he doing well? Yes, he's doing fine. But no thanks to you. I have to remind you my dear... it was your obsession ...sick obsession what brought him here. And I have to remind you… My love... That it was your fault that he ended up here, since you came into the house shouting like a madman. He was just having some fun, Alfredo. Having fun dressed up like a circus freak. I should've burnt all those things long time ago. Specially!... ...that little gift you still keep in that jewelry box. My curiosity to know what my mom kept so secret in that box was growing. In that jewelry box there are more things than what you ever gave to me. Ok you two better get out. You're not allowed to scream nor argue in here. Go discuss your problems somewhere else please. I wanted to flee that place… … To roll as fast as possible… Then Suddenly, the wheelchair became pretty fun to ride… so I speeded up and took over the place It was at that moment... ...when I was having the most fun… that I saw how fortunate I was... despite my circumstances... I realized that there were many folks... … in worse situations than my own... but they kept on fighting... If those kids could... Of course I could also be able to make a full recovery… If Lucho Herrera fell off his bike and stood back up to win the race… … I would also be able to stand up and walk… I would be able to do it... … Though not for now... Elvis, my love! You're doing it by yourself, how great! Champion! You're doing excellent! Congratulations! Look Antonio... Your mom and I have made a decision. And it's the best for us all... If we give each other some time off. Yes my love... we've considered that... the best option for your recovery is… that you and I go by ourselves to grandma's house I'll come visit you every weekend, eh? And hey! I'll be calling you every night. Two weeks later we packed my stuff… … and we left the city… to Grandma's house… Of course I demanded... no more diapers Grandma's house was abandoned since she passed away Granny she used to serve us hot cocoa and kingcake that's where mom grew up with my auntie A peaceful place on the countryside far from any burger place. Just be careful honey, be careful here mom, I can do it myself Does the phone work yet? You're already waiting for a call? Of course! I'm waiting for my dad to call me No... Well... this one to the right... is your grandma's room I'll sleep there. You can stay on my old bedroom. it is over there If you need anything you tell me. ok? I don't know why my mom brought the damn pictures… it was like pouring salt on a wound Mom! Love, what just happened? are you ok? What is this? What's wrong with it? This is a girl's room, I'm not staying here. But why not? It's one groovy place, look! I, myself chose the colors, don't you like it? No. This is a girl's room and I will not stay here. But how come? Don't be so complicated, honey We can paint it whatever color you like then arrange your toys around later on. not complicated. I just don't want my cousin make fun of me No. This is a girl's bedroom and I'm not staying here. I want to go with dad now! Elvis Antonio, enough! You're staying here. Period! No more discussions. Mom hated things being dirty… So that same day she began to clean and organize the house… Hello! Mrs. Maria? Yes, how's it going? Fine and you?. I'm Rogelio. Oh yes, it's a pleasure. I was waiting for you. Rogelio Torres, it's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey freckles come here say hi to the lady. Hi. Hello. Please come this way. William! Bring the wheelbarrow up here. Well the idea is to place a ramp out here. That way my boy can come down to the fields... and come play with the animals. Well if you need it done sooner we can make it out of … wood... could be it will take us around… ...two days you'd say? Well then, that's perfect. This is your home. If you need anything, I'll be inside with my son. If you excuse me. Freckles leave those tools there. Tools are not for you how can I make you understand?! You should let Freckles help us --- ---Don't you get in this William! Hey kid! Do you want to come play in the computer? You have a computer? Yeah. Daddy can I go? Go ahead, but don't touch anything. What? You mad or something? This freaking hooligan! wanna take a beating? Hey get back to work! Is that girl your sister? No, I don't have sisters. Your girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend. Dad says I'm too young to have one. Plus he wants me to go to military school. Then who's the girl in the picture? That's my cousin Sebastian... when he had long hair. And does your mom allow you to have a girlfriend? Hmm? Freckles is not your name right? Nope. No, my name is... … Joooo.... … Joseph Mario. Yeah, it's Joseph Mario. Good thing you like to be called Freckles. How ugly are these clothes. My mom likes men wearing things like that... With long necks and bell-bottom pants. So how do you play with this? moving the stick and the button. This is so boring… Then what do you want to do? You want to go to the park and meet my friends? Sure! C'mon, let's go. Hello? Hi love, could you pass me the boy please? I have great news for him Look, he can't speak to you right now. uhhh Well, that's great. I'm glad to hear that you guys are enjoying your vacation.

How can I make you understand that... we are NOT coming back to you. Alright then. I will tell you about it, but please don't tell my boy yet. because I want to give the surprise to him in person. listen to me Alfredo... We don't want, nor need, anything from you! So please leave us alone Yes, yes of course! It's what you wanted. The minister found us a spot in the academy for Antonio. You Hear? And you know what? It's no problem that he's handicapped Even better, they'll be installing... umm ... ramps and wheelchair access throughout the school. … And a bunch of other things The best thing is that the project will be inaugurated by the one and only... our President! isn't it great? well... You'd be wasting your time. isn't it great too? Don't even try to show up around here! Yeah. I'll see you two soon then, dear. Do me a favor, give my boy a big hug on my part... as soon as he's back from the cinema I love you. Minister. Thank you, thank you very much. My wife is so happy. she is left speechless. I'm going to hit the white one. Only the white one. But there are like five white ones you dumbass. There are three, ready I don't know where Freckles is taking me… but I hope his friends get here soon… … Before those young delinquents come and start robbing us all our stuff Let's see if you can win next time. we got him again. Too late now... They are coming Hey there Freckles! Freckles? Hi Pedro. So you found yourself a boyfriend? No, he's reserved specially for you. Well I leave him for your mommy. Why not for your daddy. No Arturo, you went too far You don't mess with people's dead moms... Shut your mouth you faggot. Faggot your dad! What the hell man! My dad's your dad TOO, dumbass! My bad... my bad... Well at least I'm not a fatso like you, that... the priest had to use a pool for your Baptism Well at least I'm not as skinny as you are, that when playing hide and seek, nobody is able to find you. And when you poop, you wipe with dental floss… these kids do know how to insult each other… Alright, alright you're done acting stupid?. So where did you find Wheels? My dad's building a ramp at his house. Elvis invited me to play atari and I invited him to the park. Atari?! That's sweet! You should invite us to play! Yeah c'mon! Honestly, I don't think mom would like the idea so much… She is obsessed with cleanliness… she even make me take a bath every day… Yeah… We'll see... I have to ask mom first. She only lets me invite one friend at a time. Well look, you bri-- bring me in, and these two wait outside Oh wow my little brother deserves it now. you wheels, Hold onto these. come on, come on bro, you deserve your slapping I'm starting to like these kids. Oh you dumbass! Dumbass! You didn't remind me that we have to go help dad! True that! Get on bike let's go! Later Freckles later Wheels! Later Freckles! Bye wheels bye It's Elvis! Elvis Antonio! Right on, Elvis-On-Wheels! So what does their dad do? He collects uh.... ...scrap metal, glass, bottles, paper, of everything. There's no way... Mom would definitely not let them come into the house… At least not wearing those clothes... I have some hot coffee for you Wow! Mrs. Maria. Thank you so much. You shouldn't have bothered ma'am. No, My pleasure. it has some sugar already. Much appreciated Some bread though? But where's the bread? Don't be rude man! No, no... We're good Than you. This is my dad's workshop. But he doesn't like anyone to touch anything. well, maybe just me I only need the bathroom, quickly! Over there. You need me to help you? No that's gay! I can manage myself. oh no no no no no no I'm not going to sit my buttocks.. on that crapper it looks like a public school toilet look at it! where is a diaper when you need one... The only thing left was to face this with dignity… Freckles! I swear Freckles, if you tell anybody about this I will never let you back into my house. Don't laugh! than You got the same thing too! Woah it moved! No it did not! Yeah look, it moved! No it didn't! I think you should tell your mom and the doctor, that it moved. Are you mad?! Nobody can know about this. I want to go home now No, Don't worry, I won't tell anybody. What's in there? That's my mom's bedroom. When she died, dad never slept again in there. and packed everything. plastic wrap? who does wrap everything in plastic? bed, desk, even the night table … This was my mom. really, who? Your eyes and mouth look pretty alike. Really? You're the first to tell me that. And when did your mom die? Freckles! How man times have I told you not to touch your mom's stuff? Don't you see this is a sacred place? You're painting your face again? Aren't you ashamed in front of your friend? Oh man, go clean your face. This is not a circus. Oh and another thing, about the tools… You know they're not for you. You could get hurt. you better go home, son It's late and I don't want your mom to yell at you. Freckles, please walk him home and you come back here straight away. You're supposed to clean the kitchen, there are dirty dishes all over. This kid does the dishes? Go! I don't even do my bed good luck with the wrapping mister. nice to meet you Hey kid! Hey kid! my house is not that way! my house it's over there I'm not going to your house. But your dad said to take me there. I don't care about whatever crap my dad said. just go to your home. maybe it was the circus comment his dad made... Stop following me! Go back to your house Now But for a moment I identified with Freckles we had things in common I wanted to know him better so I follow this kid everywhere It's not my fault that I'm not strong like him nor Willie. It's also not my fault that I'm this way. I think that if I would've died in place of my mom… ... dad would've been much happier. What can you tell a friend when he says something like that? I didn't know how to cheer him up... I wanted freckles to know how special one can be… But I didn't say a thing... I come to watch the sunset here when I'm down. You have to be very careful of the ants though. There's an colony of them by that tree. We tried building a clubhouse under it... But the ants made us leave. Back away from there though, it's dangerous. What should birds feel when they fly? Seriously, you're too close to the edge! How happy they must be... And how quickly they move throughout... You could fall. Free, like the wind on their faces... Just like when I rode my bike... Why did you do that?! You are just like my mom at the hospital whenever I would look out the window She thought I'd throw myself... Did you ever think to throw yourself? Of course not! I was able to see a park, where other kids were riding bikes and, I liked to imagine myself as one of them riding my bike. Would you like to ride a bike once again? Would you like to prove your dad that you can be a big help at the workshop? And Just at that moment, we both got the same idea… at the same time… And that's how the most important project of our lives began… There was no time to waste... We had to start right away… So I'll see you tomorrow? well, we'll start tomorrow … Yeah, in the afternoon... ... around two ... so we can tell Pedro and Arturo Alright, I'll also have to tell my mom beforehand. Ehhh, so tomorrow... ...tomorrow afternoon it would be... Hi Sweetheart Cousin Hey cousin, hi aunt. you look so good You too look good auntie who´s that one? him? he´s a new friend, he´s showing me around uhh and he's your best friend now? that quickly right? I have to go bye, see you tomorrow Ok, bye see you tomorrow what are you doing tomorrow? mom, I´ll be in my room that kid is wierd come cousin, I have to ask you something ok what´s going on? How Lovely the room you got cuz, I really like the colors. I guess you and my mom are ... the only ones that like it. Because I don't. Hey cousin you even brought the dish? The chicken flavored one from the hospital? Yeah I did bring it But come here. Do you know why my mom was, crying? Solving this mystery... would require intelligence, and high-technology tools. Things that of course, we didn't have. Alright cousin, I'm arriving. So you came to change my mind about Alfredo? But to be honest, throwing away thirteen years of marriage is just dumb. and make-up sex is so... Ain't it good? It's been a while... since the last time we did anything. Let's be honest, the marriage was doomed ... ... since the first day. Don't complain because... in this day and age... that a husband takes his wife on their honeymoon to see her platonic love, her idol, that you don't see. Obviously you don't see that. You don't see that. Basically, since... Since he never did it. There you go! Elvis! Enjoy yourself! Hey dear I'll go play for a bit, ok? and then I'll find you. That explains... not having photos! Awh Janeth. Seriously… the second best Elvis Impersonator In town? Elvin! Elvin... You know what's even worse? cousin, is like an Elvis Impregnator. Elvis Impregnator? What's that? Let me get closer. He spent all the money on the casino.That cheap-ass. An Elvis Impersonator? Yes! Elvis Impregnator! At least did he look alike, gorgeous and all? You sure you heard right? I don't want to talk about this anymore. Don't be so cruel. Yes, an ELVIS IMPREGNATOR! Hey! What are you doing eavesdropping on us?! Go back to your room NOW! in the eighties... mom's shoes had a killer aim What happened? They caught me. My auntie could win a olympic gold medal for shoe throwing Search Im-preg-na-tor. Goodnight cousin. Goodnight. The mystery surrounding my parents' ... honeymoon and the jewelry-box kept growing time for me to investigate I was going to do the dishes before leaving... But I'm in such a hurry honestly. yeah, I can imagine. I'll do that don't worry. Mrs. Maria I can help you if you want. No Freckles... don't worry, it's all good you keep on playing. No, no worries I usually do all the dishes at home Ok? Alright, I'll call you if anything. don't worry Drive carefully because the road is… They guy working for you, is so good to look at. Hey, you should invite him out. A nail takes out another nail. He's even got a kid that washes the dishes. That kid seems a little confused, doesn't he? Poor thing . So you did notice that also, right? He kind of moves funny and girly, I don't know. Hopefully that's not genetic, 'cause if so, you're screwed. What do you mean? I'm talking about this kid's dad the father Well it would be a waste of a man. But look at that lovely smile. Your inner dentist is coming out. I'm checking out his chest instead. Those thighs... That ass... Nooooo I still like that lovely smile of his. Or do you think that I like men with yellow teeth? Not ... but I like him Of course, that's why you studied to be a tooth-puller. Oh sure, I love men with yellow teeth. Silly, now go. Don't want to. yes Mrs. Maria where is the soap? Yes dear, let me give it to you.

One thing though. Elvis can´t talk to his dad, ok? If Alfredo calls.. Do not pass it to him. Hey Freckles. Which of these you think it's nicer? But I do know that Mrs. Maria loves going to the movies. Really? Because... When you go out with folks such as her, you gotta dress well. Show some class.

You two always hang around the house doing nothing either way. I already said no Elvis Antonio. You're not going to see Alfredo today, period. Do you think Elvis is right saying we do nothing? We do a lot of stuff yeah, but I mean, like working. earning our own money Now is the time to act If I wanted to go see my dad…. … I had to do it on my own… Can you help me with that box please? This one? Yeah. Well… Even Napoleon needed help from his troops… Thanks. How are we going to help William with that? This is all I have left from my birthday. We can grab a taxi… And go to the central Military base to find my dad. This is not gonna work. Of course it will! It's the only way to help William. We have to talk to my dad, today! If my mom is not willing to take us, then we'll go ourselves. You really would do that for us? Well yeah. We're friends, right? One does anything to help a friend. There is something I wanted to tell you. Promise me you will not be upset with me? I don't know. You have to promise me. But what is it? You promise not to be mad at me? Ok, I won't be upset. Freckles! don't they teach you any moral values at home? How dare you do such a disgusting thing, kid! That is not right! You don't do that! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What happened? It happens, that this little brat is never coming back to this house. You understand me? But I'm a… But, but nothing! You be quiet! No sorries. I'm going right now to tell your dad!. And you! You Janeth stay with Elvis, because he's grounded. You hear me, Elvis Antonio? You're grounded! Now let us go. No more of this! I told you he was weird! Rogelio! Hey Rogelio! What's up Maria? is that all you have to say? you should be ashamed Your Freckles, just kissed my Elvis, on the mouth! Seriously? Yes, seriously! Why the hell are you laughing?! Well what do you want me to do? A Beating? It's kids stuff, who cares. Just kid's stuff? How is this just kid's stuff?! You don't know how serious this is? Freckles kissed my son on the mouth! Well, who says it wasn't your boy who started it? Huh?! Because my son is not of that kind! Okay... I see... So the problem is, what kind of people we are… So because I'm not wealthy, our kids can't share a friendship. I'm not talking about money! God! I'm talking about morality and values! And I don't want, Freckles to be a bad influence to my son. You undersstand me? So Freckles is a bad influence? Yes sir. Do you realize what you're saying to me? Of course I know what I'm saying to you! You're making such a big deal over this silliness! You should instead let his dad talk to him and teach him about these things in life. Because, obviously, you can't handle it What are you saying?! You know I'm right. Your kid needs a man at home! A father figure! You have no idea! Maria, Maria, Calm down! Jeez, they're just kids! Nothing wrong with that, it was an innocent thing! An innocent thing? Yes of course! -Not innocence! Not innocence! -Then what else, what else?! What else is it going to be? You better call his dad and tell him what happened! Call his father, and I bet you he'll say that there was nothing wrong with just a little kiss! Do you even know Alfredo for you to say that?! I don't, I don't know him! But now I see why he doesn't want to be with you anymore! Cuz, Are you going to runaway? Why are you grabbing my clothes?, am I running away too? Don't be a dummy, cuz They're for Arturo and Pedro. So they can come visit, or go into the store, the library… Without any problems. But that's not the priority right now. You have to go to the store and buy the strongest relaxant you can find there. Relaxant? Yes, a relaxant. Mom's not going to let me sneak out of the house that easy. So we must make her fall asleep. Then I can go find my dad. Hey look this one is for you, and this one for you. Elvis sent them for you two. This is Sweet!

Some kids came asking for you two... but I'll remind you that you're grounded. So, You guys can't go outside. What's up? We've been waiting for you! The plan is cancelled. What are you doing in there? I don't want to talk about it So, what are we doing now? What if we play on the computer? -Yeah, C'mon! - on yours Yes?, C'mon! Well, Sure. My aunt left with my cousin... Sebastian got grounded for two weeks, that's for causing us diarrhea… Arturo and Pedro played video games for a bit. Then, they also left... We were left alone, just mom and I... I knew she was sad. I wanted to get closer to her… But never did... I knew that she wanted to talk to me also… But she didn't got closer either. What are you doing here? mom's going to kill you if she sees you! You better get ready. I have a plan. You'll be able to see your dad today. I'll be back. Freckles, come here! What's all this? It's a bike for Elvis. You know very well that ... you're not allowed to talk to that kid anymore, I told you Besides, You shouldn't touch my tools. How can I make you understand that this stuff is dangerous. You could get hurt. I know But it looks good, doesn't it? Alright yes, but... I need you to understand that this is no place for you. You could hurt yourself with this equipment. William was helping me though. I miss my uncle. true, I miss the sun of a gun too. But being in the military will do well to William though. Believe me Freckles. Daddy what is it? can I ask you a favor? What is it? Could you… ...take me to Elvis's mom? How can you even ask for that? After how she treated us and all she said to us? You have nothing to do with her. Yes, I have something to do there. I need to know some things. What do you need to know? Ask me, I'm your dad. what do you need? It's something intimate, see It's a ladies' thing. Good lord, It's a women's thing. Well... you can trust me, tell me. The thing is,... that I'm ashamed of telling you. How so? no, no, talk to me Tell me. it was this morning... When I woke up and went to the bathroom… There was blood. What's up with you? It's nothing. But, Why do you want to talk to that lady about that? because I feel like I can trust her. She used to be very nice to me, before all that happened. She treated me well. Besides, what happened to us with her… It was not really her fault. What do you mean? It was my fault. The thing is, Mrs Maria and Elvis think that... ...that I'm a boy. I told them my name was Joseph Mario Why did you say such a thing? Like that makes sense. Josephine Marie, my girl... Why did you say such a thing? My little Freckles, you definitely are crazy. But you're gorgeous! You don't have to hide your hair. Nor your face, nor who you are either, dear. I apologize my princess, I'm so sorry. No, no need, Mrs Maria, it wasn't your fault Well, boys will be boys.. I mean, boys and girls. Girl? Oh Rogelio. Don't worry, though. I'll try to explain all... she needs to know about these girls things. Freckles is a girl? Then I better get going. I'll leave you ladies alone what am I to contribute. I know, right? No wonder those funny feelings, when Freckles and I were wheeling You seriously are a girl? Yeah. Let me see then. No way, are you crazy? You've already seen me though. So? That was before you knew... I wasn't a boy Not fair. Too bad. Is it true that you became a woman now? Eewww, no. No, I made that up so you could go see your dad today. Seriously? Yep, I knew my dad wouldn't talk about that thing with me. You ready? What for? So we can go. Understandably I felt confused, when my friend and I schmoozed Elvis, Freckles, let me out! C'mon!

I knew it since the day we got married. the honeymoon gift your dad gave me... was an early indication So you never saw the real Elvis? That night... I went up to the hotel room. And I grabbed all the money we had. Then I bought it... The most expensive ticket for his show… Right on the front and center row. what's this? Shoot!, We've been robbed!! Maria? And I saw him And he sang like never before. Then, he kissed me... Just as he used to kiss all his fans… Right on the mouth. When the show ended... I received an invitation... that no other woman would ever reject. And we were together all that night. and we laughed and talked... But Then... he's gone and I could never talked to him again... But he gave me something... so I could never forget him. Then after that... Alfredo and I decided to completely forget that matter. What is it honey? Just the ants mom… It itches… You can feel them? Yeah! Elvis, do you really feel them? My name is Elvis…. … Elvis Antonio, because my mother wanted it to be so… And at twelve years old, I found out... that life could change, in a blink of an eye… [♪ Left a good job in the city ♪] [♪ Workin' for the man ♪] [♪ ev'ry night and day ♪] [♪ And I never lost ♪] [♪ one minute of sleepin' ♪] [♪ Worryin' 'bout the way ♪] [♪ things might have been ♪] [♪ Big wheel keep on turnin' ♪] [♪ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Cleaned a lot of plates ♪] [♪down in Memphis ♪] [♪ Pumped a lot of pane ♪] [♪ down in New Orleans ♪] [♪ But I never saw ♪] [♪ the good side of the city ♪] [♪ 'Til I hitched a ride ♪] [♪ on a river boat queen ♪] [♪ Big wheel keep on turnin' ♪] [♪ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ If you come down to the river ♪] [♪ Bet you gonna find ♪] [♪ some people who live ♪] [♪ You don't have to worry ♪] [♪ 'cause you have no money ♪] [♪ People on the river are happy to give ♪] [♪ Big wheel keep on turnin' ♪] [♪ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ One more time... ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ oohhh-uuhhh-ooohhh (harmonizing) ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Rollin'..., rollin'... ♪] [♪ Rollin' on the river ♪] [♪ Yeahhh ♪] [♪ uahhh♪] [♪ Yeahhh!!! ♪] [ Applause and cheering ]
