But now... now she does, right? I'm OK. Are you out of your mind? I got involved in a totally fucked up scene here. Hey, now fuck you. Be polite. There's a lady in the car. Everything is fucked up. What's your name, hmm? 767. OK, 767, what you feel like doing, eh? Nothing. We can't keep driving around like this. That's not my problem. I didn't ask you for anything. Don't ask me to make decisions for you. Comfy? My feet hurt. OK. We'll get you some new kicks and some fresh gear. Here. Thanks. I'll go in alone. You won't need to go, man. The alarm might go off.

You think they get jealous? No. She's all yours. No, no, no, no, no, no. Thanks. Good. Slowly. Why? Slowly. You should eat slowly. Right. Thanks. Would you care for anything else, ma'am? Oh, no, I'm good. Kind of slow this time of year, I guess, eh? Yes. Yes. But we always have people passing through, you know, the restaurant's reputation. Oh. What? You're like in a guidebook or something? No, no, actually we prefer not to do that. Really? No. Why? Well, the crowds there, they're dreadful. There are just... things can get out of hand. And then where would we be with just three stars? I have no idea. I can't. You can't keep your eye on everyone. No. You couldn't keep your eye on everyone. How about, um, after dinner drinks on the house? Enjoy. She thought we were going to leave without paying. Thank you. For what? For everything. For the... the meal. I, um, I can only thank you in the bed. You can turn the lights out if you want. I'm not saying that you have to turn them out. But if you want to, it doesn't really matter. It's been such a long time. I don't know if I remember how. You might have to each me. I mean, you know how they do it nowadays, you know? Everything. We can do everything. All right? Madame, that was excellent. Thank you so much. Oh, it's my pleasure. Really, that was such a treat. I just got out of prison. So it was very special for me. And, you know, it's been years. I've been in a wet, dark cell, no sky. And I... that's why my period stopped, I think, because of the darkness. You know, first it was a week late, then two weeks late. Pretty soon, you just forget about it. I... I... it's not my fault. No, no, no, no, no, no. I just... I want you to appreciate the bleeding. I know that makes you cranky, and, you know, you feel bloated, the pain and everything. But that's not what matters. What matters is the bleeding. Why are you telling me this? So you'll be aware. And you tell your friends. Because we don't talk about these things enough. No, we don't. We don't talk about it. Do you have a mint? Yes, like, right... yeah. Here you go. You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My name is Jean. What's yours? Peter. Well, there's not going to be much left of you when I'm done, Peter. It's now time off with 767. I have my period. Everything OK? No. No, really. It's over. It will be all right, hmm. Jean Bersome, 767. She couldn't hack being free. Shit. What? She's got a kid, man, in prison. Boy or a girl? It's signed Jack. They're all... they're all Jack, man. How... how old is he? Just a kid. If you need anything, you know where to find me. That's him. Jack Bersome? That's me. Your mother sent us. 767. Well, why didn't she come herself if she got out two months ago? Yeah, but she... you know, she went abroad. Where? Portugal. Where's Portugal? I mean, I haven't heard from her in two months. She couldn't write? What the fuck is she doing in Portugal? She split with a good friend of ours, terrific guy. He's an engineer. Agricultural. She said go and get Jack and take care of him. And she's very happy. She'll be back soon. Who's this agricultural guy? Don't worry about it. He's a good guy. If he's so good, why isn't he here? He's got a record. How many busts? One served, two suspended. Not bad. Is that your car, Plymouth Fury? Third generation. The Swedish police used to use that. And they never die. Check it out, man. This shit's vintage, man. This is Marie. She's our girl. And now I'm yours too. The only hitch is I can't come. Coffee? Sure, just a drop. You're not hungry? Yes. Want some jam? I don't know. We share everything. Hmm? Go ahead. We want you to. It's our pleasure, man. Your mom was... she's something special. Jack. She's really great. Come in. Thanks to us, a good deal is cooking, hmm? Yeah. We're not always doing the wrong thing. I'm proud of us. Every about that chick. And no one's ever courted her. I mean, really, wooed her. That's what she needs. She wasn't made right. She said it herself. It's like she's missing a... a chromosome or something. Her little chest gets me. You can almost see the heartbeat. She's like a little reindeer. Yeah, but it's a point of honor, man, because we went through the matter deep. Yeah, but it's not always about the johnson or the coochie, right? What do you mean? It's the brain telling the body to let go, eh? It's perplexing shit. What was that? Shit, man. What is that? What man? She's digging it. We're not involved at all. Petey, Jesus, it happened! It happened! I came. I came! Suddenly, everything turned purple, my hair, my fingernails were on fire. I felt like I was going to exploding. Go! Oh! That ought to cool you off. But I did it. I got my Christmas present finally. But I think of how we knocked ourselves out over your hang up. Fully, night and day. I mean, what does he got that we don't got? What? One that vibrates? I mean, we put... we put our hearts into it, man. This man's a harder fucker, man, a samurai. Ahh! Yeah! What did he do to you? Things. Well, what kind of things? Nothing special. Anyway, I was the one who did everything. You? You don't do anything. Well, yeah. He did not have the balls to touch me. So I had to do all the work. And all of a sudden, he busted a nut. And that's what made you come? No. I had him close, try if you feel like it. So he did, making love to me. And he pops again. Two pump chump? Lucky you. I asked him if he's a virgin. He says, yes and starts making love to me again, slowly. Kissing me. Kiss me. Kissing me. Then this time. No, OK, we got it, OK? No. But this time... Marie! Oh, I got to go. He needs me. Marie! Marie! Oh, Jack, yes! Woo! It's too much. Yeah, they're from another generation. No respect. Want some? Wouldn't want to be any trouble. Maybe a little scrap would be all right. There's no dessert because our cash just ran out. Oh, well, that's a bitch. We'll have to score. Can't go on like this. You got a gun? Who said? It's $100,000. It's a cinch. No risk, you know, just some old folks. We prefer to make our own decisions when it comes to risks. Yeah, well, you interested? I mean, I could do it alone. I just... I do need a gun. It's a... it's a work tool. Well? I don't give a damn. You decide. Fine. Here you go. Good luck. Thank you. I told you they'd cop out. Hey, who said anything about copping out? Hey, man. Hey, what the fuck's going on? You know this guy? Yeah. Hey. Hey. Look who it is. Son of a gun. Yeah. Remember me? What a surprise. How you doing? Yeah. What are you up to? Same game as before. Oh, yeah? What's that? Jack? You fucking shot me. Where's Jack! He's just standing there like a statue. Get in. He's got the gun. Man, don't cry. I'm not crying. Emotions are for assholes. Hey, didn't you love him? I don't know. I didn't have time. He got the job done, OK? But you have to be a dumbass to shoot a cop when we could have gone like that. He wasn't a cop. He was a prison guard. The poor guy had nothing. He never smiled. Yes, no, thanks, again, stand up, sit down, lie down. Just like a fucking gym teacher. Maybe he didn't notice he was free. You want me to hold it for you? That's indecent exposure, man. I know about that shit. Yeah, man, life is a bitch. But, still, you have to look on the bright side. We got our lady back, eh? You asleep? No. Hey. You know, why don't you get up and take a look around? There's a whole galaxy out here. Mhm. The Big Dipper right in front of our face. Oh, make love to me, sweet Pete. Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, that's so good. Oh, my god. Yeah! Jesus, hurry up. I'm coming. Oh! Oh. Huh? You have to go. What's wrong? You can hitchhike from here, man. What did I do? Nothing. We are accomplices to an attempted murder. It's in the papers. You're not. You didn't hurt anyone. But I'm... I'm in deep with you guys. No way, man. You have to go. When I just started coming, I'm feeling like this. No fucking way. Hey! Hey! Don't be crazy, woman. I can't see you in a cell with a number on your back. Stretch your wings and fly, girl. Listen to my feminine instinct. Sometimes I have vision. I'm never wrong. We're not going to jail. So shut up and make love to me. I don't know who chose this car, but it's worse than a prison cell. Ah, it's good for the environment. Fuck the environment. Man, I can't breathe. I got to get out of here. Oh, he can't breathe, man. What about the other people too. There's other people in the car. It's not just you. I know, but I... You know it's always about him, right, Marie? I'm getting really squished here. Yeah, always about him. Always about him, shit, man. It's unbelievable, man. I told you not. A family picnic and shit. Ah, no, no, no. What... what are you doing? I just have to pee. Oh, I've got to pee pee. Eww. Yeah, mira! Holy shit. Oh, man. What's up, man? Hi. Another bank robber special. What's happening? My Uncle Ronaldo had a 1968 red and white top convertible. Nice. That's a great deal, our smart car for a muscle car. Yes! Yeah, that's it, man. She's fucking cute, right? Starsky and Hutch! Dad, they're taking the car. do something. Honey? My fucking car! It's a fucking classic. Dad, do something! It's our car! Hey, come back here! Dad! You guys did good. You should be proud, eh? You've got a real good solid foundation now, Marie, OK? Where are we going? I don't know. What are they going to do to us, put a hole in our ass? You already got one, man. Yeah. What do we do, just drive around till we run out of gas? Why not? Why not? You're happy? Yeah. I am. We're good together, no? Yeah. Thanks, man, peaceful, on the road, hanging loose. Oh! Go on, man. Come on, bitch. Shake it. Woo! Shake it, baby. All right, come on, shake it. Ho! Ahhh! Ahh! What's that? Shit. The brakes are jammed. Oh, filthy hairdresser. I thought this car looked familiar. Why didn't you say anything? Yeah, it was orange, I remember. Oh, my poor little balls. It was your idea.
