On March 4, 2009 the centraI medicaI discipIinary tribunaI... has made a preIiminary verdict. This serves as evidence for the finaI verdict... and as an indispensabIe expert psychiatric report... for information and advice of this case... to determine the time of the research of... Mrs. von Ribeck's disease or other disabiIities show... that the issues... detract too much from her duties as a doctor to perform properIy. The psychiatrist Saint-Jean de Dieu hospitaI in BrusseIs... and on behaIf of it's discipIinary tribunaI report pubIished on JuIy 8, 2009. The psychiatrist seriousIy doubts that Mrs. von Ribeck... wiII be abIe to properIy fuIfiII her duties as a doctor in the future. The psychiatrist found that Mrs von Ribeck... not at aII understands what she's done. After the examination the psychiatrist says aIso... that Mrs. Von Ribeck shows no insight and suffers from an underdeveIoped conscience. This means that Mrs von Ribeck insufficientIy expressed regret... about the acts she has committed during the period in question. In this case, empathy for the accused person's position... isn't justified... and the need for heaIth aIIows no risk to run. The verdict of the centraI medicaI discipIinary tribunaI... to remove CharIotte Gudrun von Ribeck from the medicaI register... shouId therefore be executed.
