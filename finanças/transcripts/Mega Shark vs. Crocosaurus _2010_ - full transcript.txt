What do you think you are doing? He'll kill you... I have to feed my familia. Leave! Well, well, well? What do we got here, mate? It's yours Mr. Ross! I found it. Sure, it is! - It's a beautiful diamonde, Mr. Ross. - I said shut it! Not a diamond... It's a shell. Oh, look Mr. Ross, my diamonde! No one leave! No one. Now get back to work. Over here, everyone! Go! Start digging! Cracking here, it's like working with a bunch of women. Hey! Hey! Hey! Sun of bitch! I can't make heads and tails out any of this. Where is the whale or shark guy? McCormick! Tank 3 is ready, Lieutenant. On my mark. Decrease by the factor of 7 from a thousand Megahertz. Starting now. The hydrophones are mimicking the sounds of a dying fish. Terry, Captain Smalls is looking for you. He need to see you CS right away. Terry? Hey. Oh, hey, Corrine. Check this out. You know if I increase the frequency by just 5 MHz... I can create a more consistent sound velocity. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Watch. Alright. Alright now watch the shark follows the sound waves. Alright... Now if I increase the sound... Watch how the sound repels the shark. Isn't that great? It repels the shark... sound. This could change everything... - Wow, - OK, Terry, I'm gonna leave now before that great white shark breaks loose. Yeah... No, no... There's still some kinks in my Hydrophonic Spheres but... It's good. I'm on itself. This is good. Remember, Captain Smalls wants to see you. You need to calm down. I love you. Even though you like to play with big fish. Come see me, after you talk with the Captain. Here, meet me at 13:00. - I think I know what time that is. - Do you now? This time... And fix that. Yes. OK. Sir, sorry about the tanks. I miscalculated it by increasing the frequency. I could vibrate the wall in... Lieutenant McCormick, I'm sure that the research that you're doing on sharks gonna prove invaluable to our divers. But for right now, I need you to tell me what you see right there. Heat Displacement, sir. Is it chop projections? Real time. 10 second increments. 10 second... it's not possible. Those are whales. Right? No, Sir. Whales sleuth, they go up and down. The Sharks they go from side to side. If you look at the heat projections you will see the size, the girth... I mean they all move in as one unit. This is massive. Lieutenant, You got sharks on the brain. That is a part of whales. Captain, If I could get my Hydrosonic device in water, I think I can use radio waves active sonar identifier. No, no, we're done here. All I need was a confirmation on that. - No... no this... this is way bigger than that. Those... - Lieutenant McCormick, it is over. - The shark is dead! - No one saw it. Excuse me? No carcass was found. No massive bodies washed ashore. No one can conclusively say that the Megalodon was killed by the giant set of-- Lieutenant McCormick, you can leave my deck now. Yes, Sir! Hey. Are you OK? What's wrong? The Captain Small gave you another speech? A massive heat distorted foot print was found not too far away from here. Stop stop... what? Corrine, the giant shark's back. How? How do you know? - The Captain Small said anything? - No, but he intimated enough. I... I just... Then, I'm sure it's nothing. I need to get my Hydrosonic Spheres in the water and in this chance... - I can stop it, OK? - Stop! You hear that? No sirens no drills... nothing. Calm down. It'll be OK. It will be OK. Meet me at 13:00. - We can release some of your stress. - So bad... so bad... Alright. Corrine. Damn it! What the hell was that? Sound channel warning! Corrine! Corrine! Corrine! Corrine, Wake up! Come on, wake up! I should have been here! Sir, We gotta go. Not sit here! Sir! We gotta go now! Get away from my sheep, you son of bitch! - How are you doing, Michael? - Yeah, Nigel. - Sorry about your pig, mate. - What happened? It'll come to in about three days. How many days? Three days? No, no. You have to explain this to my wife. I've done it before, right? No... no. This time you have to act as if you are sorry. - Alright? - OK. Give me some whiskey will you. Thanks. Cheers. That pig of yours almost killed me. N... N... Nigel Putnam? Well, there is only one reason an Aussie bird be in the Congo ain't for the beers, mate. No, Sir. Well, let me guess. Triple with the blood diamonds? Or illegal coal mines are raping this beautiful country? - Coal. - Coal. I suppose the villagers have seen some unusual creature emerge one of the holes such a dug out of the mountains. Oh, yes actually. Not interested. We willing to double what you are currently getting paid. Triple if you can capture it. To find what? We don't know. But none of our workers mind there until they know it's dead. What is it? A Ghost? A ghost that has already killed 34 of our men. Oh by the way. You better explain and apologize Mrs. Formy... Eh? C'mon Miss Australia. Show me a ghost. So... uh how long have you been searching for 'creatures'... 'ghost'... 'goblins', that... that kind of thing? Have you ever found anything? Anything? Look, I know that you think what we do is wrong. But we pay the villagers a decent wage. You know what I think? I think If I'm gonna work for you... we should just focus on this monster of the jungle. OK? There it is! - There's what? I don't see nothing. - That whole area. - There's nothing there. - Exactly. Sorry, Mr. Putnam, we need to hurry this along. I got to make with rebel leaders in about two hours. If I write you a check now. Then let's just say was a... methane leak. Yeah, that sounds right to me. And so groom a hazard. Your how should we say... uh... open? Do this count things. Miss. Legatt, I once felt the breath of 1,500 pound white gorilla down my neck. I have wrestled, lifted little creatures that have two heads and 15 spike tails that ate flesh of children. I have seen all the horrors of this jungle. Now there's nothing here or anywhere that surprised me. - But this was a creature. - No, it isn't. How can you tell? You're standing in the footprint. - Miss. Legatt. - What? Wonderful... very wonderful! Hello? A little bit of help heaps, please? Be nice Crocodile. Nice Crocodile. Go ahead. Nigel. What brings you out of the jungle? Really? What's the boogie man this time? Look, Man I've seen plenty of crocs. Come on, man. You're still just thief and a scoundrel. Really? And it's coming here now? I'll go [out back?] and check it out. Luise. It's Louis! This is gonna cost Nigel 50%. Fifty. Fifty? I want at least ten. Keep dreaming. - I want my 10%. - Yeah, whatever. - My 10%. - Don't I always take care of you? What, like the last time? Look, man. Last time wasn't my fault. I'll take care of you. Nigel. Yeah, you are right. That's the mother of all crocs. Well. My boat may be available for the right price. - Tell him I want my 10%. - Shee! Well I mean I was thinking 50% - 10% - Son of B... Well, good luck finding another boat. You're still cheating scoundrel. But I tell you what nothing less than 50%. Alright, I'll see you then. - You tell him about my 10%? - Shut up! - Look we sail in an hour. - Yes. And you're not getting 10% You sign a waiver not to seek medical attention? You are the only survivor on a ship to carry over 2,200 sailors? Have... uh... have you recovered any of the satellite transmissions from the USS Gibson? Um... I need the data. I need the data because... - Would you like some water? - No, no... I need the data. The uh... the sonic impulses attracted the Megalodon and it's possible that... It's possible that I've caused the Megalodon attack. (It's possible that I've caused the Megalodon attack.) Out! Excuse me? I think I was pretty clear. This is my investigation. Here. Read it outside. Lieutenant McCormick, I'm special agent Hutchinson within NOAA. Not a talker? Good. I'll talk, you listen. I represent an elite group of military commanders. We are on a hunt, Lieutenant McCormick. - To kill a shark. - It was my fault. It was my fault. You no good to me if emotionally compromised Go rest, I won't bother you again. No! No. No. I can help you draw the Megalodon. I can create the beacon. I can help you to kill the beast. I need... to help you kill the beast. Please. Good. There's no pay and you start now. - Ready? - Yes. Dude. Have you ever seen well, an egg that big? - Yeah. - Oh, no. But I'll tell you what I do not want to see. What? The baby crocodile comes out of there? That's exactly right. Hey, man. You sure your boy Nigel knows what his doing? I hope he'll be OK. Besides that thing up there won't wake up. You mean that thing out there still alive? Yes, it's tranquilized. Man, I need to find another job. Relax. Anything goes wrong I'll make sure you get 10%. Are you sure that thing isn't gonna wake up? Nope. That's reassuring. You got the eggs? Yeah. On the lower deck. Counted and controlled. That's all she was doing, you know? What? Protecting her eggs. From what? Who wants an omelet that big? Guys, guys, the Captain wants everybody to put on their life jackets. Nigel, you all right? I'll bet he does. The way he's driving this boat, is he drunk? You should remind him what cargo we've got. I don't think she's the only beast out here. Hey, Jim, he's under there! What are you gonna do, sink us? Okay, maybe he's gone. Maybe he left. The croc! The croc's waking up. - Cut the rope! - Leave the rope! I said leave the ropes! You cut the rope, there are two of them after us. They just and she's just... she's just protecting her eggs. From that thing! No! From us! Cut the rope! Leave him! Aah! Aah! Butowski. Admiral on deck! Sir. Find my target yet? Negative, sir. Butowski, this is a Gurkha black dragon, the most expensive cigar in the world. Now, I promised myself as soon as we kill this creature that I would fire this up and smoke it. I really want to smoke this cigar, lieutenant. So tell me. Am I gonna get to smoke my black dragon? Yes, sir. Admiral. This is lieutenant Terry McCormick. My shark expert. What? No. ...yes. Yes. Well, what are you? I'm an aqua acoustical engineer. Sharks are my focus field. Look, I've made some groundbreaking discoveries. Take it down a notch, lieutenant. I read your file. I know who you are. You like to experiment with audio levels to find out what can repel a shark. Well, that is exactly what I want to do. Yes, sir. Welcome to my domain. Every seaman, from recruit to special agent to me, we are all dedicated to hunting, finding, and killing the Carcharocles Megalodon. This is an elite and invitation-only club. If you are on this ship, That is your only purpose. Understood? Yes, sir. So why are you on my ship? Hunt, find and kill the Megalodon. Sir. Excellent. Show Dr. McCormick his new quarters. Show him his new lab. I want to see his shark repellant thing in action. It could come in handy in the thick of things. Special agent Hutchinson, I have to send you back out again. There's been another hit. A cargo ship. A few survivors. Yes, sir. Niños, niños. Venga. No tocas. (Kids, come on. Do not touch) Muy, muy sucio. Venga. (It's very dirty. Come here) Aha! You here. What's your name, boy? Scott - Get outta here. Stupid kids. Where's Louis? You know where he is. You should've jumped. I never liked him. That's why he jumped. Where you going? I quit. Whiskey. Hard, por favor, please. Tan dinero. Huh? Dinero. Dinero. - Oh, dinero.- Mm-hmm. Dinero, dinero, dinero. Big dinero. Esta quebrado. (It is broken) No. Mm-hmm, yeah. No, impossible. Oye, la botella de whiskey. Mm-hmm. I got a feeling this whiskey's gonna cost me. I'll take it. You know, the last time a beautiful woman pay for me the bar... Didn't end pretty. Don't flatter yourself. Smelly, middle-aged children aren't my type, Mr. Putnam. So what's your name? Special agent Hutchinson. Secret service. Ooh, that's a hell of a name. So how can I help you, special agent? Intel. You and a few other survivors have a story to tell. And I need to listen. You know, you'll never kill it. Even with the entire force of the U.S. military? Have you ever seen the exoskeleton of these things? I mean, these things were designed to survive. They've survived for more than 400 million years. - You know, these Crocs, they have the intelligence of a human be... - Croc? Who's talking about a crocodile? The creature that attacked your ship was a shark Darlin', I know the difference between a shark and a croc. You see, sharks are limited to the ocean, whereas crocs, oh, no, they can rule land and sea. Sharks are fleshy, soft penetrable flesh, whilst Crock, impenetrable. The croc found you at sea? No. I caught it on land. Best trophy I ever had. You need to come with me. Where are we going, back to your place for a little R&R? Otherwise, I'm staying right here. Thanks for the whiskey. This isn't a request. You can go willingly or reluctantly, your choice. Nice. Nice. She's tracking in the north Atlantic ocean, near Nassau. Impossible. An hour ago she was southeast of Newfoundland. Zoom. She's faster than we thought, sir. That's because she's not our shark What is it? A whole other game we're about to play. Aah! Sir. - Dr. McCor... uh-- - Lieutenant McCormick, I believe it is these days. Well, look at him now, but, please, don't be fooled. Behind his scientific facade is a man with more voracity than a lion. In other words, his fiancee is the best piece of ass that's ever walked in an African jungle. Isn't that right, lieutenant? Can it, Putnam. Oh, it's all gone quiet over there. I wonder if your little lady got to know you very well and dumped your ass. I said shut up. The Admiral needs your full attention. Great. Croc man. The name's Nigel Putnam, sir. Quite a setup you've got here. Butowski. Sir. Show crocodile man where the eggs are. Yes, sir. At approximately 1834 hours, we discovered these images off the coast of Eleuthera. They're crocodile eggs. We believe that they're eggs. Excuse me, sir. Some sharks do lay eggs. Now, we have no idea where these came from. - I mean, they could definitely be shark - They're croc eggs. Look at the shape, mate. I do believe I've seen a few. Admiral, this man is not who he says he is, okay? He's a charlatan, he's a con man. He talks tribesmen in the jungle into believing there's a bogeyman... And inform small feed. He'll rid them of their ghosts and demons. I'm telling you, we're better off with having him out of here. My back pocket, sir. Ooh, baby, feel that orange. Nothing. Honey, either dig deeper and tell me you love me, Or get rid of the cuffs and I'll find it myself. Sir, this is a crocodile shell. Now, I had a bigger piece. Sir, that's the only piece I have. Take this to lab one, and test everything. Wait. We can't be looking for a Megalodon and a prehistoric crocodile. We need to do more analysis, more fieldwork, And I need you to bring back an egg from the little lady. It'd be my pleasure. Sir. Admiral, we have echo-technology. We don't have to physically go to the eggs. We have all that we need here. The man's right. Why don't you boys all stay here nice and warm in the belly of this ship And pray to god that your satellite and your sorry ass can work the shit out of here. If you want to get close to this beast, if you want to get to know it. Or more importantly, you want it dead, I really suggest you allow me to go get some eggs. Hutchinson, go with him. You, too, lieutenant. Me? No, sir. I have to test my You hearing. Because I don't think you heard me. You need to go and see if those are shark or crocodile eggs. That is not a request. It's an order. Yes, sir. I don't see why we both need to be out here to retrieve these eggs. This shark could be nearby, and my device is not ready to repel it yet. Incredible! What? You, that's what. You haven't changed a little, tiny bit. That's why you never experienced Africa. What are you talking? I was in the corps. I dealt with disease, famine, rebels... You dealt with graphs, numbers, charts. Imports, exports. Did you even meet one person that you were supposed to be helping? I met a few, okay? It... it wasn't my job. My job was to develop agricultural models for the peace corps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In the meantime, did you experience Africa? Hah, there's more brother in me than you. Really? Really. Well, if you're saying I didn't experience robbing and killing villagers And denying their dignity and their pride, then, no, I didn't experience Africa. Shut it, guys. You would've thought once he got laid. Really, Putnam? Yes. Look, this is a simple job, and you two are making it complicated. And I hate complicated. We go in there, we get an egg, we bring it back, and we're done. Got it? Got it, then you'd better start looking by the shoreline Because crocs like to lay their eggs by the shoreline! Got it! How long until they hatch? I don't know. Regular crocs five months. These things, I don't know. How will we know? How will we know if they hatch? You will see little crocodiles. Little 25 to 30 foot crocodiles. Eating people. There. There. Look at him. Poor Terry, huh? A social butterfly he is. Always has been. Try to be number one. We should leave him to his noises and shark and go find some croc eggs. What do you think, special? There's the entrance. Check your coordinates again. I might not know much about crocodiles, But I do know they usually lay their eggs closer to water. Oh, really? Well, in Africa, she laid her eggs in a tide pool. And they wound up fully submerged in water. Now, that can happen accidentally... Unless... Unless you don't know what the hell you're talking about? Unless it wasn't an accident. Unless she laid them in water on purpose. Let me borrow those, will you? Holy... what the hell are these? These are amazing. Heat-sensing. Outstanding. Holy shit! What do you see? I see eggs. Lots of eggs. Scattered all the way along the coastline. How's that? That's what crocs do. They lay eggs. Hey, tell me what you hear. It's chirping. No. Yeah, but it ain't no bird. They're either hatched or they're hatching. Crocodiles chirp? Oh, yeah. Hey, guys! Is that a fin? Where you goin'? What are you doing? Feed me the coordinates to the Admiral so we can launch an offensive. We got 10 minutes to clear out of here. Oh, no, you better call that off. These are my eggs. Your eggs? Excuse me? Excuse me! My eggs. My home, My expedition! And all you guys are doing is getting it wrong. No, Putnam, you're getting it wrong. This is a threat to national security. This croc is not your trophy. We've got a distress alert coming in from special agent Hutchinson. Pull this up. They've located the eggs, sir, and they sent us these coordinates. Sir, they're asking for a missile attack. Damn you, Hutchinson. You can go after her eggs now, but you won't hit all of them. And where's mama croc, huh? You hit her eggs now, you're gonna have one pissed-off croc going after anything and everything. Guys! Guys, guys! The shark Jeez! Go, go, go, go, go, go! We have to get out of here. We have two minutes. Maybe they'll kill each other before your guys arrive. Maverick one descending to 1-4-0. Target in sight. Fire on command. They missed the crocodile. They missed! You guys missed! That shark went in right after her eggs and the croc came in right after her. I'm telling you, man, your croc must have a strong maternal instinct. She's not mine. She ain't my croc yet. Gimme these, man. They belong to the U.S. military. Actually, they're my personal property. And don't you need 'em, miss crack shot. Couldn't hit either of 'em. Yeah, but we got the eggs. Yeah, but not all of 'em. They're layered and scattered all over this area right here, Hutchinson. - I'll put another team out. - Oh, no, you won't. What you need to do is focus on a 1,500-foot pissed-off crocodile that's headed up the coast. Yeah, and a hungry Megalodon chasing 'em. You need to alert the entire eastern seaboard, Hutchinson. We're sending feeds from the external cameras. We've issued an immediate alert up and down the Atlantic coastline. The national guard is taking the lead. There she is. Yeah, she's heading to Miami. Wait. Where's the shark It's been spotted out in the Atlantic. We have another ship out there to form the attack. Conn. Torpedo is locked. On my mark. We only have one torpedo in the hole. Well, you better not miss. And fire. Torpedo's away. We have a direct hit. You might want to look at this. Look at what? Focus, people. We haven't seen anything yet. Now where's the croc? It's entering Miami, sir. Do we have a clean shot? Negative. Too population-heavy. Kill zone visibility is less than 2%. Try to find a pathway. Give me a 15% window and then go hot. I'm on it. We have got to find a way to drive her back home. Think, Terry, think! Yeah, why don't you think? Why don't you think, G.I. Joe, how you're gonna drive a 1,500-foot crocodile back out to sea. This is just amazing, something I thought we'd never see again. Look at the size of the creature. An Arc Flash. Ex-excuse me? An Arc Flash with about 1,000 amperes or more can create enough electrical force That it'll drive back the crocodile or at least stun it. It's gonna have to be a pretty big flash. The Turkey Point nuclear facility. It's about 25 miles from here. - Look, we can get...- And do what? Surrounding a nuclear facility you're gonna have dozens of conductors, right? So you get a high-amp source and you attach that to a conductive object And you can create and point an Arc Flash. Create an Arc Flash off a nuclear reactor? Yes. - I'll call the Admiral. - All right. Get the commanders from Homestead and Miramar. We need to tap into the Turkey Point nuclear plant. Now. Turkey Point. This is the USS Lexington. I need to execute an Arc Flash immediately. Sir, I don't think we can do that. This is a direct order from the chief of naval operations. Do it. Yes, sir. Sir, the Lexington just contacted us. We need an Arc Flash immediately. An Arc Flash. Get me the chief engineer and report to auxiliary 5. Yes, sir. Get hold of auxiliary 1. Tell them to prepare for an Arc Flash. Really? I know. Just do it. Notify auxiliary 2. Arc Flash to commence on my mark. Lexington, this is Turkey Point. This is Lieutenant JZ Butowski of the USS Lexington. I need an Arc Flash to hit Orlando immediately. We'll do our best. On my mark, guys. Orlando. The Turkey Point conductors are ready, sir. They're taking aim at the creature now. Five seconds to fire. 3... 2... One. Again, Tell 'em to hit it again! Aye-aye. She's turning around. Whoo! Is there any track on the Megalodon? Butowski. Red indicates the crocodile. Green, the shark It's staying in the Atlantic. Deep waters, warm waters. The shark appears to be swimming alone, parallel to the stronger magnetic fields. It's using them to navigate. Don't look at me. Hutchinson excluded. I don't know where the croc is. What I do know is I need to find them eggs that your men found Because if we can dissect one, maybe, just maybe, we'll find its Achilles heel. They're already on their way. Two are aboard The Invincible. Two are dangling from a couple of Blackhawks. They should all arrive in 30 minutes. Well, maybe you're gonna get your luck break... Sir. What's that? Is that coming from inside that egg? Captain! Come on, Terry. Not good. Damn! Aren't you even gonna ask? If you're referring to your eggs, then no. They were devoured by the Megalodon. What do you know? They're a lure, like my Hydrophonic Spheres are. They attract the sharks So it's a good thing you don't have the eggs on this ship. Otherwise, we'd be target two. Oh, you're saying we find the eggs, we find the shark I'm saying we find both, actually. We find a very protective mother and a very aggressive predator. Nice try. Just where the hell do you think we're going to lure him? We don't have a cage or tank big enough. True, we don't have the cage. But we do have this. The Panama canal? Admiral on deck! That is a bad idea. Okay, that is insanity. It's too dangerous, and it's too close to civilization. I mean, anything could happen...! It's already happened, Terry! Risk can work. We're just gonna have to take a risk. What risk? Sir, the Panama canal has three locks. We lure the beast and her eggs in one lock. Bingo! We have them trapped. Then launch a full attack. Shred 'em to bits. Admiral, Admiral, Admiral, over a million people live at the banks of the canal. I mean, it's insanity. We'd be putting people in jeopardy. Plus, we don't even have any eggs. Then I suggest you bring your Hydrosonic balls with you. Admiral, where are you going? Well, somebody's gotta tell the president That we're about to blow up international waters, Defy god only knows how many treaties, and figure out how to kill these bastards. I'll be back. I gotta ask you something, Terry. You don't even know if your balls are gonna work on it, do you? Look, I've been focused on repelling the shark with my Hydrosonic Spheres And now the Admiral wants me to lure them in. He wants me to attract them. I don't have any calculations or models or anything for that. Look, I think I know where we can get some more eggs, real ones. You need to have the Admiral send out an extraction unit to meet me at these coordinates. Just where the hell is this? It's where my ship went down. I think there still may be some eggs there. And you're holding this information back why? You were hoping to retrieve them later. I'm a con man. At least it's close by. Right off of Aruba in the Caribbean sea. I'll see what's available in the area. Maybe we'll catch a lucky break and find someone nearby. Sir. We have new orders from the USS Lexington. Well, did you swallow your own damn tongue, officer? No, sir. It sounds like we're going fishing. What the hell does that mean? Have you found my eggs yet? No, they're just sending the divers down now for your eggs. Cool, then we can turn back. The eggs will be enough to bring in the creature. Besides, I don't think I can change the codes on my Spheres. Descending now. 100 Meters. 110... 120 Slow and steady, lieutenant. We don't want this thing to buckle like a ping-pong ball. Yes, sir. 125. Sir, we're approaching the seawall. Port engine, half back. Sir, we're not gonna make it! Tanks back, full rudder! Not enough, sir. Brace for impact. Damage assessment. Hulls 3 through 5 are breached, sir. They're taking on water fast. Lock down rooms adjacent to hulls 3 through 5. Yes, sir, but we're taking on water fast. I highly recommend we turn back. Steady the course at 0-1-0. - Sir, I highly recommend...- lieutenant! Copy that. 135... 140 Engines back one-quarter. 145. Distance to target? 5 Meters, sir...4 Kill the engines. 3... 2... 1 target depth acquired. Dispatch, this is Argonaut. Target depth acquired. Awaiting instructions. Let's go see what we got. Hold on. We're about to land. I'm telling you, this is a mistake. Look, those creatures will dive underwater and they'll miss the bombs entirely. We'll never be able to trap them in the canal. Sharks will drown if they stop moving. If we hold her in a tank like the canal lock, we don't have to bomb anything. I know I'm not ready. Then let's pray they found my croc eggs. Eggs? What are these, 10 feet high? That's affirmative, sir. All right. Deploy the extraction unit. Let's pull these monsters up and get the hell outta here. Yes, sir. Dispatch, this is Argonaut. Attempting extraction. Over and out. They're preparing for the transfer immediately. There she comes. It's a crocodile egg. We need to get it in the water. Let 'em lower it. I can make this work. Doesn't matter. We have the egg. The creature will come. No, That I'm right. Just give me a second, get this in the water, it'll be fine. Once the egg is lowered, the creatures will come. It's instinct, right? Yeah, maternal instinct, self-preservation. I get it. Once they're here, we're out. Trap them and bomb the hell out of this place. Understand? Sir, the croc is about two minutes from entering the zone, and the shark is even closer. Evac the area of all personnel. Get the fleet on full tactical alert. Evac the area of all personnel and get the fleet on full tactical alert. Yes, sir. Pack it up McCormic. We need to get in the air now. I said lift, damn it! We have to evac. The Megalodon's two miles from here. Let's go, damn it! Contact at 3-0-9 degrees. Contact at 3-0-9 degrees. Aye. Ready weapons. Ready weapons. Aye. Fire on my mark. Aah! Your bombs ain't working. If we could get 'em in the canal lots we can drain them or what? All they're doing now is making them more pissed-off. Tango-bravo-1 ascending to 1-4-0. Oh, my god, the USS Corman is down. I think the shark's headed toward the first lock. Where's the croc? Outside the lock, about a half a mile. She's in the first lock. Yeah, she's headed toward the croc egg. Sir, the Megalodon has entered the first lock. You've got a green light. Weapons hot, all systems go. Looks like they just drained your canal. Holy crap. Why aren't the bombs killing them? Same reason you can't shoot most crocs... skin tough as concrete. You need a big force to take that mother down. Yeah, but people kill crocodiles. Sure, most crocs have a soft spot behind the eyes at the back of the head. That ain't most crocs. They just took out Panama. They destroyed everything. We can't stop 'em. You gotta stay on top of 'em! You can't let 'em go. Boy, they're fighting over them eggs. Hutchinson, get the Admiral on the line. Now. Let me get this straight. You're trying to tell me that all these purple dots here When the shark and the croc were spotted together, these are the times... Those are the times that the shark was coming for the eggs Which could only suggest that she laid eggs at each and every one of those locations. Impossible to lay so many eggs in such close succession. I've heard of rapid reproductive cycles, but even fruit flies don't reproduce that quickly. She obviously has some type of built-in Evolutionary adaptation that allows her to produce more rapidly when her offspring's in danger. That means she's laid hundreds of eggs. The Megalodon's probably gobbled up the majority of the eggs, if not all of them, already. And if she hasn't? Then god help us when they start hatching. I've got eggs here, sir. They're off the coast. Here. What are we looking at? Hundreds. Maybe even thousands. Movement, sir. My god. I think they're hatching. Hutchinson. Come in. Hutchinson! Sir, we've just got a report that the smaller crocodiles are attacking the Santa Monica pier. Sir, the USS Carter wants to know what to do. Carter? It's a nuclear sub. It's followed the creature into the middle of the North Pacific. They're heading toward a seismically active area. They won't be able to pursue the creatures once they hit that point. The shark is heading to Hawaii. Wouldn't you? My guess is the Megalodon has discovered more eggs. It can swim, walk, or water-ski to Hawaii. We're gonna nuke those bastards right out of the water. Sir, we have sonar contact. Airing 2-4-7 degrees. 2-4-7 Degrees. Aye. Engage target. Engaging target. Aye. They've got to stop. What? They're shooting nuclear weapons. They miss. And they hit a volcanic feature, Then all of Hawaii will be devastated. I want a target assessment report. Target assessment report. Aye. Target is gone, sir. Where the hell is it? Tell 'em to turn off the engines. What? Sharks are attracted to electrical activity. That's what he's chasing. If you tell 'em to turn off their engines and sit quietly, it just might miss them. See, there's enough volcanic activity in the area that it's creating an electrical hot spot that could... Just tell 'em to turn off the engines. Copy that. Engine room, prepare to go quiet. Target is back, bearing 0-6-2 degrees. All engines, full speed ahead. All engines, full speed ahead. Aye. Nothing? We've lost all communication. I'm still picking up the beacon from the sub, but... Try pinging. See what kind of footprint we can de-scramble. What is it, damn it, the sub, the shark I think it's both. I think it's shark. Just went nuclear. All right, look at the trajectory. Projections? 21.1 degree north to 157.8 degree west. Heading South of Oahu in the Pacific. We have to get them away from the coast. That shark swallowed a nuclear sub. We have to get that thing into the middle of the ocean and destroy it. And I'm supposed to do that without any eggs? And how the hell do you know? Maybe there's some new ones in Hawaii. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to approximate the sound with my equipment. Oh... your equipment? That really worked out well last time. Listen, you fake-ass pirate, - You have any better ideas? - Take it down a notch, lieutenant. We'll follow your advice. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! We just got the first report of those crocs hatching in Hawaii. It looks like the eggs have already hatched here. Wow. Look at that. Something's drawing them all here. They're coming from everywhere. Roger that, USS Lexington. And the relocation effort? Negative. We haven't found any eggs yet, just empty shells. Get the Squadron in the air. Yes, sir. What's he saying? No eggs. Hold on! We gotta move you out of the helicopter. C'mon, we gotta get out of the helicopter. She's alive, she's alive. Leave her... leave her where she is. Let's move her from the helicopter. You stay here with her. - Move her...- We've gotta get some help! Go get the creatures. We're gonna help you! We gotta help her, we gotta help her. - Leave her here. - I'm not gonna leave my fiancee! I'm not gonna do that! I'm not gonna leave... I'm not gonna leave you. Look at me, Terry! She's not your fiancee, okay? Listen, listen to me. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. - Terry! - If I leave, I'm gonna leave her forever. This is not your fiancee. Listen to me. I'm sorry about your fiancee. I can't bring her back. But we can go kill this monster. But it's gotta be you and me. Are you with me? Are you with me? We'll be back for you. Come on. Her cries must be luring her offspring to help her. That's why they've all been converging here. It's the same when the mother croc responds to cries of her young. They're responding to the cries of her pain. It's amazing. No, no, no! They have to stop hitting the shark He's got a nuclear submarine inside. It's a nuclear bomb now. What are you doing? We're gonna blow up a volcano. Oh, yeah? With what? With this. I'm gonna find the right frequency and lure 'em in. And at the same time, I'm gonna create the biggest explosion and kill 'em 10 times over. We bring 'em both to the sweet spot, it's game over. Oh, yeah, well, you haven't been able to make it work yet. What, all of a sudden you've got some divine inspiration? You know You talk about me lying to the Africans about ridding them of their monsters and ghosts. But look at you now, man. With you, it's delusional. I can try, right? I'm not gonna stop until they're both dead. That's me. Sir, Hutchinson's down. Survivors? Casualties of war. Let's focus on the creatures. Yes, sir. Anything? Holy crap, man. It's working. They're coming. Where's that explosion of yours? Terry! Not yet. We gotta get outta here! Not yet. No. Holy crap. Hey! Hey! You idiot! You idiot! They're going towards the sound. No, they're going towards their mother. Yeah, well, either way we gotta get outta here. Now you're talking my language. What's that? A remote. I know that. What's it for? Your explosion. It was nice working with you, shark man. Same to you, croc man. Holy shit, Look at that. Sir, the creatures are toast. Yeah! All right! All right, baby, we got 'em! We got 'em, baby! Yeah! Sir, looks like you can smoke that cigar now. All right! Yeah! I knew you'd wait for me, baby. You owe me some whiskey. How you holding up, Terry? Better... I'm feeling better. Are those mine? Nigel, I think you just made Hutchinson smile. Well, pigs can fly. Buckle up, boys. We're goin' home. What a crock.
