I wanted him to be my friend, but he became me and I became him. It's no good shrieking. In the suburbs, no one can hear you scream. Hi, Jack. So, there I was on the road last night, eenie, meenie, minie... Moe! And there was this gent waiting to become a pancake. He wouldn't eat anything I gave him. He must be starving! Watch the spikes, they're sharp. Thank you. Come on, little thing. Sarah. Ian. Breakfast. Not now, Mum. I've got to go into town. - Thanks anyway, Mrs Gillespie. - Jack can have his. Jack can have whatever he wants. Breakfast, Jack? Yeah, I'll have a quick cuppa. He's good a bad leg. Poor old Spikes. Sanctuary one minute, christening the next. Hello, mate. Hello! Uh-oh, another victim for the wounded menagerie. New word? Four syllables. Have you seen Jessica's hospital for animals in distress? Sarah. Looks like there's room enough for a hedgehog. Hold still, Spikes. You've got to eat something. They like worms, you know. And berries, I think. I know where there are blackberries. Can I? Oh, go on. I'd better dash. - Is it my BO or something? - No, I've got a busy day. I'll catch you later. Thanks. Come on! Jump, you prick! Jump! Come on! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... Go on! Fuck off now! - Fuck off! Muppet. - Monkey! - What are you doing? - Nothing. How do you do nothing? You go to that Catholic place, don't ya? Convent of the Blessed Virgin. Are you a virgin? We don't like posh fucking virgins around here. How clever, swearing. I said we don't like posh fucking shitty little virgins around here. Stupid. - What do you want, Lemming? - Yeah, go find a cliff, you weirdo. Don't! Why? Do you fancy him? - He got hurt before. - Bollocks, he never gets hurt. He'll jump off anything, that's why he's called Lemming. - Is it a bird? - Is it a plane? No, it's Lemming fucking falling again! - Grow up. - Just cos you want to fuck him. - Shut up! - Oh, shut up! Shut up! Daddy, buy me a Porsche! I want a Porsche, I want a pony and I want it now! Oh, yah, Daddy! What are you looking at? You deaf or something? Stupid. New patient's in here. I'm sure Mum's flowerbeds are very grateful for the fertiliser but there'll be more crosses than crocuses soon. - Don't, Clive! - Thought you were dead to the world. I'm working on it. Anyway, I'm only teasing. You know that, don't you, love? Thank God hedgehogs aren't litigious. What's your name? Hey, virgin! What's your name? Stupid. What's your name? What's yours? Tom. So? It's a secret. All right. Do you want to come somewhere? - I've got school. - After, then. - I can't. - Why? I just can't. Fee, fi, fo, fum I see the blood of a virgin's bum. Just shut up! Fee, fi, fo, fum... Stupid weirdo. "One turf shall serve as a pillow for us both. "One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth." "Nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear, "lie further off yet, do not lie so near." "O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence! "Love takes the meaning in love's conference. "I mean that my heart unto yours is knit "so that but one heart we can make of it." "Take the sense, sweet, of my innocence. "Love takes the meaning in love's conference." What's that mean? Think about it before the next lesson. OK, off you go. Thank you. Jessica, can I have a word? Have you thought about being in the play this term? Maybe as Titania? I don't think so. Well, I think you could surprise us all... and yourself. That's not a blush I see before me, is it? No. Can't have the Queen of the Night shuffling around without some rude mechanical. What do you think, Father, the next Vanessa Redgrave? Why not? I could be John Paul III. Think about it, Jess. - I can't. - You'll like it, Fee-fi-fo. Secret place. In the woods. Got berries there. There's a lake. Oh! Wow, what's all this for? Don't know. Could be useful. - You use our convent chapel? - Yeah. Father Felix. Father Fuckwit we call him. I can't stay long. Why? Because. I'll drown meself, then. Well, not now but I have to go soon. - Don't you? - Never. Won't your parents get angry? Stay! Well, you've got to go home sometime. Yeah, I really believe you. I really, really believe you! Oh! What are you doing?! OK. Keep it open, Fee, so I can see inside your head. My real name is Jessica. Keep your curtains open too. So I can see you at night. I have to get back for dinner or Mum will go crazy. What about yours? There's food everywhere, Fee. Natural stuff. It's good for you. We can bring things next time. I can get stuff from my mum. No. Nobody knows where we are. Swear not to tell anyone, ever. OK. Swear. I swear. Ever? Ever. - Ugh! - Yummy! Come on, Tom. Let's go. Come on. I've got to go. Really. So, enlighten me, So, enlighten me, how exactly did you manage to fall into a lake all on your own? I said I tripped. She's back now anyway. Maybe we should get someone to look in while we're out tomorrow. Jesus! - Well, I suppose we could ask Jack. - Whoever. What you need is a hot drink with some choc pud. Fee! - What are you doing? - Seeing how far I can fall. I've got some food. Oh, chocolate. Stop it! How can you not like chocolate? It tastes shit. It looks like it too. Shit. Oh! Tom? Intruders. Is that you, Lemming? You up there, you fucking little nutter? He's fucking not there. Come on. They come here... all the shitfaces. Walking their stupid dogs, spotting their bloody birds. But it's our wood really. The good wood. Tom, Fee and the trees. Can you hear what they're saying? And? And... And the trees are saying... "Yeah, we've been around forever." "I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. "I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. "My ear is much enamoured of thy note. "Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. "Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here... "whether thou wilt or no." Oh, my God! Oh, Jack! You were born to play the part! "Well met by moonlight, Titania." Anyway, there I was the other day gandering around this bookshop when... - Eenie, meenie, minie... - Moe! Oh, thanks, Jack! I heard you were out on the razzle the other day. Did you have a good time? It was OK. Yeah, doing what? - Just walking. - Yeah? Through water I heard. No Moses around to part it for you, then? No. If not Moses, anyone interesting? Ooh, sorry. A secret, is it? - Just a boy. - Yeah? What's he like? Oh, sounds good. - Good enough for a spot of lippy. - No! - No? - No! I'm only joking. Gordon Bennett! What a mess! Come here. Come here. Look at the state of you. Jesus. That's better. - He won't tell me things, though. - What, your fella? About what? Stuff. His mum and dad. Well, I guess he has his reasons. Look down. But you, of course, want to help him, yeah? Well, I guess you've got to get him to trust you. That's all clear. We both know what that's like, don't we? Look down. When there's no one you can really... talk to. Don't get like that when you grow up, huh? I guess you have grown up really. You're old enough for lipstick. Come here. So you just... You just walked, huh? No, er... touching? - No. - No? Not even here? Or here or here? Or here? Or here? Nope. Nope? It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. I've got the perfect solution for your curtains. I couldn't afford the ones in real silk but, hey... You can't have the place looking like this... Well, I'm off. You know where I am if you need me. - See ya. - See ya. Bye. "Out of this wood do not desire to go. "Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no. "I am a spirit of no common rate, "the summer still doth tend upon my state "and I do love thee. "Therefore, go with me. "I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee, "and they shall bring thee jewels from the deep "and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep. "And I will purge thy mortal grossness so "that thou shalt like an airy spirit go." No, that's not good enough! "Got lost in the woods" is not bloody good enough! We're glad you're safe but we need to know where you got all these cuts. Trees. This is not Oz and you are not bloody Dorothy! Trees do not attack people. I never said they did! Darling, please! She is never walking home alone again. - Never, ever, alone again. - Come on, Maureen, take a breather. Come in. It's the doctor. - Doctor Thomas, the locum. - Hello. Jessica. Oh, well. It looks as if you took on a small army and lost. So, what doesn't hurt? Hold still, Jessica. Clive, will you find out if the police are going to turn up? Right, yes. Looks like you sprained that. What happened, Jess? Make it clear to stupid old Mum. What is it, darling? Nothing. I just got lost... scared. I hid till morning. Oh, thank God you're all right. You are, aren't you? In one piece anyway. The police will be here in five minutes. I'm afraid they won't let you off so easily. Er, drink, Jack? Er, no thanks. I'd better be off. Yeah, go on, then, with a kick to it. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Not an impromptu confession? I do have a staff meeting to get to but go on. It's... been a week since my last confession. I've... Remember, whatever you did, God was watching. He knows already. Yes, Father. So, come on. I'm a confessor, not an inquisitor. I... Sorry, Father. You can't run away from it, Jessica. I know, Father. Look... it can sometimes be better to reflect on your sin for a while, so why don't we get to the bottom of this when I'm next in for confessions? Yes, Father. Good. So why not light a candle to Our Lady in the meantime? Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, mother of God. Pray for us sinners now and at... - Hi, Nicola. Gonna give it a whirl? - I think so. Then there's always rubber truncheons. Shock treatment, sleep deprivation. Or your father could put you through the complete Gilbert and Sullivan. Well, when you decide you are ready to talk, let us know, because until then, you're grounded. How's he doing? He seems all right. Has the book been of any use? I had way too much to drink the other night, it got out of hand, didn't it? I couldn't get to sleep thinking why you stayed out all night. Anyway, you seemed to convince the police about just getting lost. I suppose you were out with that boy. Don't worry. It's our secret. Just like the other one, eh? I promise it won't happen again. I can't. They got painted over. Let me hear your thoughts. But I want to be with you. You are. I always know what you're feeling. Everything? Like for twins. You just have to concentrate. They have this, um... You know. Siamese twins. Same mother. I never had a mum. Of course you do, everyone's got a mum. Don't you ever knock? - I just thought you might want to chat. - No! Get out. Look, I don't know what's going on but... Get out! Fuck you. No wonder Nicola calls you Stressica. The doormat's not just for decoration, you know, David. Back after nine again. I hate to think the torment you'd have caused Mum. Anyway, dinner's in the oven. I made sure it's still hot. I thought I'd do one of our roasts at the end of term. How about lamb? The way Mum used to do it. I don't see why we have to have a babysitter every time you and Mum pop out for more than five seconds. Sarah, you can whinge all you like but we're not having her running off. We're not kids any more. No, clearly one of you still is. Jack will be popping round on Friday. He's our teacher. It's so embarrassing. Come on, either eat it or leave it alone. Don't torture the poor thing. But you love choc pud. It tastes shit. I'm sorry? Hooray! We're speaking. You know how fond he is of you both. Yeah. What's that meant to mean? I think she's got a bit of a crush on Jack. - Really? - No! I can remember a little girl who swore she was going to marry Jack! I never! Oh, yes, when Janet left. Whatever happened to Janet? - I really can't remember. - It was Jill, wasn't it? Jack and Jill went up the wooden hill. There's nothing wrong with it, darling. It's quite normal. She doesn't have a crush on him, OK? Anyway, if you think this little charade is gonna stop us getting Jack round, you can stop barking up that tree. Darling. Darling! Good night, darling. Sleep tight. What's that? Tommo? Wait! In the good wood, all is good. In the bad world, all is bad. The good wood is forever. The bad world is for never. You, my sister. You, my brother. Twins. Twinmacy. Even on the cross, even in all that pain and torment, Jesus still asked God to forgive us, for we know not what we do. A vision, Jessica? Sorry, Father? A vision? A holy revelation? It must be something pretty good to distract you from the boring old Bible. Yes, Father. I mean... Oh, really? So, what do you see? A burning bush? Our Lady beckoning? - Nothing, Father. - Well, that's highly commendable. You see nothing, yet you persist. Such faith. Nevertheless, if you do persist, I shall be forced to chastise you biblically. Fee-fi-fo-fum! I escaped them. Oh, Tommo! It's brill! Our burrow. They'll never get to us in here. Ta-da! I nicked it from Fuckwit. Ta-da! Our first supper. Guess who? Watch it. It didn't hurt Jesus, did it? How would you know? He didn't scream out, did he? Don't, Tom! Nothing hurts if you don't let it. Go and think of the ugliest person. That's who you fall in love with. Go and think of the ugliest person. That's who you fall in love with. Yeah, that's what you got to do. Lovely. Thank you. You didn't turn up for auditions, Jessica. Christ, Jess. Your mum's asked me to pop round to have a proper talk. Fresh start now term's over? Keeping the devils out. I can't. - Why? - I just can't. Hey, you're bleeding. One body. Hmm? One blood. Twinmacy. One blood. One body. Our blood. Our... sweat. Our... tear stuff. Our... snot. Our... drool. Our... BO. Our scabs. Our... ear wax. Our shit. Not in here. Not here. Our lips. Our... bit above our lips. Our lashes. Have you met my girlfriend? Save it! She's a friend of mine but she's very shy. Sis, what are you doing here? Nothing. Do you want to come with us? We're going to the record shop first and then for a holiday special at Jimmy's. Want a ram? You're such kids! It's fucking ace! Think sheep are the dumb animals?! You're waiting for that boy, aren't you? No. What boy? The one in the garden last week? What are you, a bloody spy? Oh, fuck off. I live there too, you know. Anyway, why are you hanging around here? No reason. Not because Mum and Dad are out and Jack will be popping in? No. Has he done something to you, Jess? No. - You can tell me, you know. - Of course he hasn't! Come on, Sarah, the shops will be shut soon. All right, just a minute. Why don't you come out with me tonight? We can have a talk. Come on. Hey, come on! Being three hours late is not good enough, is it? You have to pulverise the lamb too, stick your dirty fingers right into it. Look at your shirt! Come on, get it off. - I'll wash it. - Now! Smell it. All the dead juice. Oh, David! David, when are you going to learn? Roughhouse with your friends if you must, but you know you can't leave cuts like that untended. - Come on, show me the rest. - It's OK, Dad. So, show me! Honestly, David... You will have people thinking I don't take care of you. Come on, let's sort you out. - I'm clean. I cleaned this morning. - So, let's see, then. So, let's see, then. Let's get the necessaries. Please, Dad. I don't ask much, do I, David? Just that you take care of yourself. That you remember the blood she lost to bear you. Please, Dad. I can do it. But you never do, Davey! See, Davey? Do you know what can breed in filth like that? It never stays clean. Not by itself, no. Turn over. This is just as awkward for me, you know. But, without Mum, we have to take care of each other. Nobody else wants to know about dooberries and stuff. It's a family thing. It's not a dooberry. Nobody calls it a dooberry. Well, it's what you know about it that matters, which is? Please, Dad. I'm grown up. Come on, Davey. It's only biology. So... what's it for? Pissing and fucking. Urination and copulation. What has to happen before copulation? I have to get it to... The erectile tissue has to distend, become tu... Please, Dad. I've learnt it all. Show me, Davey. Show me what Mum would have done. Davey? Tommo! Tommo! Wait! Wait! Spy. Traitor. Traitor. Go on. Find some friends. Have fun. All right, sis? A very good party. Party, two syllables. Hi, Jessica. Go! Go, go, go! Shitface. Little shit. Choc shit. Twinma-shit. A little tipple for you. We were wondering where you got to. Just here. - You all right? - Yep. Yeah, right, and the Pope's a Buddhist. Go on, get that down your neck. So, are you coming down, then? I don't know anyone. You know me, Ian, Nicola. Come on, there's always Ade, the sheep shagger. Jesus! It's getting literally plastered you're after, then? Let's go to the kitchen. Oh, the mice really are at play, aren't they? Hi. Take it easy on the booze, Sarah. Your folks will never trust me again if they find your livers pickled. I'm not drunk. Yeah, I know. The world has just started spinning faster. So is there a glass of your teetotal punch going? No. Christ! What's happened to you? She'll be all right. I'll take care of her. I promised your parents I'd make sure nothing happened. It just needs a plaster. You're a medical expert, are you? Why, are you? I think I can judge better than some drunken teenager. Go away. She doesn't want you here, so why don't you just go? Wow, a regular little hero. - Take it easy, Max. - Yeah, I am easy. Look, I don't want to have to tell your parents about this. - Tell who you like! - Don't worry, sonny, I will. You tell, I tell. Night-night. They're not my kids. Jess... Jessica! Scream it out! And again. Again. Just... Just what? I just want to have a nice time. So? Have a nice time. Have a great time. I just want to be alone. OK. Forever. Liar. Alcohol or food, what's it going to be? Or, no, we could smoke coriander. That gets you high for at least five seconds! - Do you trust me? - No, I don't trust you. I really don't trust you. Oh, shit! Let's make soup. We've got punch, let's make soup. Mustard, mango chutney, tomato ketchup... With some vodka, we can make some interesting cocktails. Very nice. Close the door! Come on, then. Come and get it. No. Stop. No! Oh! No! Seen the time lately? Much too late for school. And much too late for your birthday. Yup. Birthday's cancelled. Ta-da! Happy birthday. And not too late for school. Is that the one you wanted? Happy birthday. - I got you a present. - Thanks. Mmm. Thanks. What's the matter? No! Get out of here now! No fucking way! Now, Max. Now! You know this guy, don't you? I'm not leaving you with this cunt. Get out now, Max. Now, now, now, now! Fuck you! - Get up! Get up! - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Always be there for each other. We said always! You didn't even tell me your real name! Tom is my name with you. Our name! You're still a bloody liar! And a bloody coward! Please, Fee! I can tell you everything. You run away for months and then come back and start smashing people. I can tell you everything. Please, Fee! I'll be in the burrow. I'll be there till you come! New Year's Eve. 1985. Ladbroke Grove. Remember? How could I forget? We danced till we dropped. Oh, what a sourpuss! - Don't we even get a birthday smile? - Probably not cool these days. Maybe she's just shy. It's not too late, you know. Birthday could still be cancelled. Indefinitely in fact. Just a minute. It's Max. He's just had the shit kicked... Wait, wait a second! Look, why did that boy do that to him? He must be bloody crazy! - Bloody crazy about you anyway. - Fuck off. - And you're crazy about him too, aren't you? - Fuck off. He must really like you to do something like that. Or really love you. You know, one syllable. I couldn't see you. Not after you'd seen. You'd think me disgusting. Dirty and disgusting and evil. That's so stupid. You, my brother. But part of the shit out there... I didn't want to ruin it here. You ruined it when you went away. Sorry, Fee. I'm a deserter... and a traitor. And evil. Nobody ever asks why. Never fucking ask why. They shout at you or hit you or say you're mad, but they never ask why. You could cut off your head and they'd just say you were crazy. And if you do try to tell somebody, they just don't want to know. You told someone? Fuckwit. What did he do? Wouldn't listen. I tried to confess but he stopped me. - What? - He said it was all me. Making things up. Liars go to hell. Oh, Tommo. It was me. - It was me. - No! Mum dying for me, losing blood. Getting dead. Tell me, Tommo. If it happened to you, it happened to me. It wasn't just what you saw. Sometimes... Tommo, if it happened to you, it happened to me. I don't want to talk about it. Show me, then. No way. Show me, Tommo. I am you. Twins. Nothing hurts if you don't let it. Let him do it. Let him do it. Let him. Let him do it. Let him do it. Where did you go? Around. Doing what? I don't know. Slept rough. Squatted. Crashed parties. Great. Free booze. Free drugs. Free food. You'd love them. All the colours. Like that. In the bloody woods! The bloody stupid music. I like it. Just a mo. What are you doing?! - Happy birthday. - No, Tommo! Shit! Got to run! Come on! So bloody stupid! Pigs are always too slow. No, Tom! How do I see you if you're arrested? Sorry, Fee. I snuck out through here when Fuckwit got too boring. I'll take care of you. What? It hurts. It's not... sexy. Sexy? Gentle. Like with your boyfriend? You're my boyfriend! Not all sexy and gentle and stuff. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I do understand. Really! Sexy. Sexy. Sexy. Sexy. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aha! A customer. I don't want you to get angry. But you must confess... especially the sexy bits. What happened to you... something happened to me too. What happened with your dad... something happened to me. I do understand. Tommo? Jess, are you all right? What's going on? Fucking perv! - Jessica! - Just leave us alone! Look, kid. You got it wrong. Tell him, Jessica. Look, I don't want to hit you, kid. I mean... - What did you tell him, Jess? - Just go away! Look, don't be stupid, not that they'll believe you anyway, but if you keep on about it, they'll put you in a home and then... Tom! Forget him, Tom! It's just us. Would you like a cigarette? Would you like a cigarette? Cigarette? You look beautiful today. I lo... You look really... You look really sexy. Your lipstick looks very beautiful. Do you... OK, you fucking perv. I thought it was stupid music? Not so bad. - No, Tom. - Why? I don't know. Because. Come on, Fee. Come on, Fee. Jess! - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm good. It's really great. I used to go to school with you. I'm Ade. - Hi. - Are you all right? Yeah. - Everyone else is here. - Yeah? Yeah, they're all around. - We'll see you later, then. - Yeah. Great. Water. Jessica! Please! Jessica. Why are you avoiding me? - I'm really sorry, but please not now. - Why didn't you tell me about him? I don't know. I didn't know. Do you love him? Christ. Just don't fuck her up. Let's go, Tommo. Yeah, let's. Let's really go. # Get down, get on down, get on down, get on down # Down, down, get on down, get on down...# Come on, love, we're going inside. I thought you were still in bed. Don't... Don't look. Don't look. There's nothing you can do. Broken neck. Probably died instantly. The pathologist will tell you more, but I'd say something heavy fell on him from a height. Someone was up here, sir. A smoker. Roll-up smokes, though. Right. Maybe they left us a video of it too. - Jess! - Oh, no. Sorry. - Do you mind... - Give us a moment, please! You OK? OK, Jess? Come on. No! Stop it! Stop the pain! They'll find out. They'll find out and they'll lock you up. They'll lock you up and I'll never see you again! Stop it! Stop it! You want more. You still want more? You never stop, do you? You smashed up everything and you still don't stop! We were meant to be together forever, just us! I had to do something. Get it out. Get you free. I only needed you. I should vanish forever. I always fuck it up. Fuck you up. No, Tommo. Be we alive... or be we dead... we'll always be... in each other's head. Twinmacy. In each other's head. "Suffer the little children to come unto me, "for of such is the kingdom of God." David's death has shocked the whole of our community. There cannot have been any of us who haven't asked ourselves that one enduring question, "Why?" The ways of the Lord are often mysterious, and never more so than when He calls a child to His kingdom. We are bound to ask ourselves, "Why?" But perhaps the one question we should be asking ourselves after this terrible accident, is not "Why?" but "What now?" And it is there that Jesus had... Come on, you, you're not getting out of it this easily! What are you doing?! Leave him alone! Take your hands off my son! Come here! Why, Jessica? Get out! Get out! You bloody traitor! You bloody traitor! Get out! Don't try and pretend it was for me. You loved me for bloody ever! Isn't it enough that he's dead? Can't we bury him in peace? Jess! Look... I don't know who you are, but please... I know who you are, pervert! I saw what you did! The pervert things you let him get away with! Get off! Get off! You killers! You bloody killers! Get off her! - Come on! - Jess! No! And the trees are saying... "Yeah." Tommo? The trees are saying... "Yeah." Tommo? We've been around forever. Yeah.
