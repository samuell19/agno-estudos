(rapid mechanical clicking) (train whistle blows) (laid-back instrumental music) - [Voiceover] Green River Junction. Green River Junction. (train chugging) (bell rings) (laid-back instrumental music) - Mr. Stewart? Yes, hello, this is Jerrine. - [Jerrine] Hi. - You take this list to the mercantile. We need, uh, 200 pounds of flour, and the rest you can read for yourself. Tell him to put it on my bill. I'll be back in half an hour. (laid-back instrumental music) - Whoa. Little lady, come on. And Jack, this is Mrs. Randall. - How you do, ma'am? - Pleased to meet you. - [Mr. Stewart] Bit of trouble with the heifers? - [Jack] Missin' four is all. I corralled the rest up on the bench. - [Mr. Stewart] Good. - [Jack] The north fence is down. - Yeah, I'll get to it tomorrow. This'll be yours then. The only stove's out there, you'll be wantin' to warm yourself. - [Jack] What'd you hear in town? - [Mr. Stewart] Old Fraser's sellin' out. Could've made it if he'd got rid of the damn longhorns. - [Jack] That man'll never figure out nothin'. Who's buyin'? - [Mr. Stewart] Didn't say. See to the wagon, will you? - [Jack] Uh, sure, man. - All the thing you've got to do with's in here, uh, flour, sugar, jerk. The root cellar's out there. You can take a look tomorrow. It's been empty for some time though. You milk, Mrs. Randall? - Yes, sir. - Ah, butter'll be a good thing again. Jack and me for meals, uh, you said you'd cooked for railroad crews, so, uh, the hayin' and brandin' won't give ya much trouble. - No, sir. - For a washin', the tub's in the storeroom. As soon as the weather eases up, you'll want to get a garden started up. I think we have some seeds left. - Mr. Stewart, in your letter you said seven dollars a week. In Denver, I got $1.80 a day just for washing. - Well, I don't guess Burnt Fork's quite caught up to Denver. I'll show you the chickens and pigs tomorrow. - I've always had my Sundays free after breakfast. - All right. - Will that be all? Good night, Mr. Stewart. (rooster crows) It's not ready yet, Mr. Stewart. (bacon sizzles) (humming) (gentle instrumental music) - Easy, easy now. Hey, Bubba, easy now. Easy. (neighing) Hey, easy, easy, boy. That's it. Easy. Come on, boy. Easy. (neighing) Hey, hey, hold it, hey! Now, easy, easy, easy, easy. (horse snorts) (neighing) Whoa. Hold it, hold it. Whoa. (soft chattering) - Goddamn kid in a cow cat. - I've never seen the like. - He don't scare me. - Somethings are sensible to be scared of. He don't scare ya, I will. You stay clear, you hear me? (milk squirts) Come on. Easy, babe. Okay now just squeeze at the top and then all the way down. That's it, and then pull, that's it. That's a girl. That's good. Not too hard, just start at the top and pull, good. See? That's it. This can be your job. (milk squirts) Giddy-up! Come on! Come on, move over. Whoa! Hello. - Hello. Where's the Stewart? - He's not here right now. I'm Elinore Randall. This is my daughter, Jerrine. - I know who you are. They call me Grandma Landauer, 'cause I have delivered so many babies in this valley. - I'm pleased to meet ya. I was beginning to believe I was the only woman in this country. - Well you are not. My ranch is 10 miles north of here, lots of cows, more than Stewart. - Oh. Coffee? - Yeah, please. - [Elinore] Do you take cream? - Yeah. I, uh, I come for Jack. My cowboys always run out on me when I need them. (sighs) We here you was coming, uh, a long time now. - The cups are in here now. Come, sit down. - He bought this churner for Annette, poor thing. She died three years back now. - Well, Jerrine and I've put it to good use. How long have you lived in this country? - Wyoming, oh, since I was a young girl. Working all the time. - It does seem to follow you around, wherever you go. - I've had my hands full, since my Benny's gone to his maker. I do everything now. Of course, you know I always did. You like cows? I do. - Cows? Only about three I ever liked. We've been churning butter here til it come out our ears. You don't anybody nearby who'd like to buy it? - Butter? Most folks do it for themselves out here. - Well, how 'bout you then, Grandma? - I can see you'll do okay. Why not? I'll buy your butter. Gonna get rich? - Not on butter and spuds. - Not working for the Stewart. He's as stingy as my old hen. - But at least you can cook your old hen. (laughing) I do have quite a garden though. - That's interesting. - Lots of spuds, beans, corn, cabbage. - Well, Grandma. - You come to my place now. The same as Thursday. He's agreed to it. - Oh, hell yes, I'll look after the heifers, but none of that laying around the saloons like last July, you hear? - Who me? Those old mares'll be on their way home before the sale is finished. Won't they, Grandma? - Don't you Grandma me, or I'll beat you with a whip. Four days. - Yep, four days. Good, Grandma? - Good. (gentle whistle music) (clanking) (cows moo) (upbeat banjo music) - Boy that's hot. - Clint, get the gate, come on, mate. (lively banjo and violin music) (cows moo) (sizzling) (mooing) (bellowing) - Ho! - Ho! - Ho! - Ho! - Ho, you send them cows right back here. - Ho! - That's good, see how you scared that one over there? - Ho! (mooing) Mama, Dan and Rawhide need some water. Can I take it to 'em, huh? - They do, huh? Well what about Jack? Doesn't he need any water today? - Yeah, he needs some too. (Elinore laughs) (cows mooing) - [Mr. Stewart] Well, you did all right, Mrs. Randall. - Thank you. - [Mr. Stewart] Come on, let's turn 'em out. - I can't talk to that man. - You'd better learn before winter. (cows mooing) - Did you ever rope with them, and all that? - Well, sure, why not? When I was younger. - You, you want to rope? - Well, not today. I've done all kinds of farm work all my life, but nothin' like this. - Now this is not farming. This is ranching. - Is that all they do up here, run cattle? - All it's good for, that and sheep. Thank God not so many sheep. - I didn't pass one place on the way up here. You'd think there'd be homesteads with all this. - Homesteads? Seven feet of snow up here in the winter. Maybe snow tomorrow. - So a person couldn't make it up here? Not even in the summer? - How long did you tell the Stewart you'll work for him? - Grandma, I'm no piker. I wouldn't run out on him. It's just that, all my life I've been workin' for somebody else. - Ah, you and me, we got to look out for ourselves. Did he tell you there's a place next door to him? - No. - 240 acres, he can't file on it. He got all the land he can claim. Folks have been out looking at it. Got old Stewart worried. - Oh, but I like this place, here, right here. - Listen to me, young woman. Don't get any ideas about living up here. My Benny, he froze to death one winter up here. You don't play with these winters. - Oh, Grandma, I-- - Oh, there's nothing to be done. - [Jerrine] Mama, Mama! - Come here. (wind blows) - Jerrine, come help me with this colt. Come on. (chickens clucking) Come on. See if you can pet his nose. Come on, go ahead. Stay on the left here. Keep her right next to me. Here we go. Come on, come on, here, just over the side. (gun fires) (pig howls) (scritching) - I'll take a little of that water. Ooh. - Ugh. - Better than city life, huh, huh? - Oh! - Give us some more. Ah! - I'll give you some more. (laughing) - [Elinore And Jerrine] Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, glory forever and ever. Amen. (grunts) - All right. * I come to the garden alone * While the dew is still * On the roses * And the voice I hear * Whispering in my ear * The Son of God * Discloses * And he walks with me * And he talks with me * And he tells me * I am his own * And the joy we share * As we tarry there * None other has ever * Known - Look, Mama, a shoe. - [Elinore] Put that back. - I wanna keep it. - Put it back, Jerrine, it's not a toy. (slow violin music) Let's go. (gentle violin music) (knocking) Hello? (knocking) Hello, anybody home? Are you all right? Jerrine, go outside and play. Go on. (door flaps) (door creaks) (gentle whistle music) (water splashes) - Well, hello there! - Hey! - Mornin', how are you today? - Have you seen my housekeeper, Mrs. Randall? Ridin' my bay mare, had a little girl with her. - Yeah, she stopped here yesterday. I was a workin' in here. Why, she was askin' and inquirin' about land and water and everything and, so I sent her up Great Creek Valley way. Thought that was the best. - [Mr. Stewart] Whoa. Hee. - How'd you find us? - Took half the night, far enough for a Sunday ride. Hee-ya! Folks don't like newcomers nosin' around out here. - We weren't nosing around, Mr. Stewart. She needed help. I apologize about the horse. - Yah, that's not what I mean. Did you see a lot of country? - It's so big. I'm not used to so much. Mr. Stewart, I'd like to have word with you. - I hired a housekeeper. I hired you to come out here and take care of my place, not get your own. - I don't think you have any complaints about my work. - Oh, well your work, just so we agree, I paid your way out here, I expect you to take care of my house for one year, that includes the kitchen and garden and everything. - Yes, sir. - [Mr. Stewart] Ah, come on, Bill. (gentle violin music) (door thuds) - [Voiceover] Have you ever filed the forms in large today? - Your name, please. - Gene Collin, I'm from Floyd County, Kentucky. - Gene Collin. - [Clerk] Are you a US citizen? - [Gene] Yes, I am. - [Voiceover] Next, please. - [Clerk] You ever filed before under the large Homestead Act? - [Gene] No. - [Clerk] Where do you want to file? - [Gene] Moose Creek. (soft chattering) - [Voiceover] Next. - Next. The name, please. - Elinore Pruitt Randall. - Marital status? - [Elinore] Widow. - And where would you like to file? - Birch Creek, next to Clyde Stewart's. That's two miles north of Burnt Fork. It's not taken, is it? - I don't know. Uh, no, you have to live on it 10 years, not just visit. That'll be $12, please. - Okay. (soft chattering) - [Clerk] Next. Name, please. * A cowpoke were riding along * His hat was thrown back * And his spurs was a jinglin' - I don't know the rest. - Well. * As he was ridin' he was singin' a song * Hey, diddle - [Clyde] That's pretty good. - [Elinore] Okay. - When can we go see it? - Ssh, don't say nothing. Okay? (insects chirping) - Here. Ah, that's a granny. This ties a square. Ah? - Jerrine, time to go to bed now. (cow moos) (owl hoots) - How much did they charge ya for the spuds? - 2.60 for a 100 pounds. How's that? - I don't know. Saunder's fair. - I just hope they bring a profit this fall. - I wouldn't count on it the first year. (horse neighs) - Mr. Stewart, I didn't have much choice. - About what, Mrs. Randall? - Homesteading the place next door. (chuckles) I had that piece for 12 years. - Well, we're neighbors now. And I'd like to make it clear right off that I'm open to working on a fair arrangement. I'm gonna need to borrow some money for seed and potatoes. I thought you could just hold my wages til I caught up. And I'm gonna need a shack built. And if you build me one, I'll exchange it for the hay and for the grazing. - Well, I do not make business deals when I can't see a profit. (chuckles) That beat all burnin' the wood this late in the season. I hope you like choppin' wood, Mrs. Randall, otherwise, what are you gonna swap for eight cords each winter? - Well, I'll just have to worry about that when winter gets here. You know, you haven't lost your housekeeper. - Well, you can always quit. - Are you firing me? - No. How many hens are layin' right now? - I don't know. 15. - 17, you should know that. I own 113 mother cows, branded 91 calves. I kept eight replacement heifers. We got 46 two-year-old steers, 11 three-year-olds, oh, and a stud, and Jack and me are partners on the mares. Now, do you know what that means all together, Mrs. Randall? That means that I get a very small livin' out of this place, and your wages will never get ya started, not even started. You would be an old woman, and your daughter grown, before ya approached the poorest sort of sufficiency. Where will ya get the water? There's no well. Will ya carry it from the creek? - I'll do what I have to do. I mean, at least you haven't lost your land. - Have I lost the land? No, not if your name be Stewart. (hammer taps) (tapping) Find me a 16 penny whip. Since when don't ya know a 16 penny? Well, hell, haul the damn board, I'll get the nail. - No, I got it. I don't know why you're in such a flyin' hurry. She don't care if it's done today or tomorrow. - A wedding present's a wedding present. Anyway, she's payin' me for it. - I wouldn't give my horse a homestead shack for a wedding present. - That's because you haven't got a horse worth speakin' of. (hammer tapping) - Hand me the ribbon. - Ouch, you're hurting me. - Well, Jerrine, if you would stand still. Okay. Stay clean. Jerrine, Jerrine, stay out of the food. Okay, take the quilts out and put them on the table. - Well, uh, lady, if you won't be needin' me, I'll be back tomorrow. - You won't be staying? - Well, I never did care much for weddings. - Well, I never did care much for 'em myself, but they're a sight better than funerals. - Yeah. (gentle violin music) - Hello there. - Hi. - Oh, you pretty little thing you. - Oh, I thought maybe I should put that one right over there. (softly chattering) (graceful orchestral music) - It'll have to do. (soft thuds) - Now, you come now. They are all waiting for you. - I burned the pies. - Ah, forget the pies. They are all waiting outside. - Wait, Grandma, Grandma, I can't do it. - Oh, now you did it once, you can do it again. Now, come on. (soft chattering) - [Jerrine] Mama! (soft chattering) - [Voiceover] This is such a thrill. - Mrs. Randall? Mrs. Randall, you'd better come over here and stand by me. - Friends, we are gathered here today to join in matrimony this man and this woman. Clyde, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, and with her to live together in holy matrimony? - I will. - Elinore, will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband, and with him to live together in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep you only unto him as long as you both shall live? - I will. - May I have the ring, please? Will you please place the ring on her finger and repeat after me? With this ring, I thee wed. - With this ring, I thee wed. - [Preacher] And with my worldly goods, I thee endow. - And with my worldly goods, I thee endow. - Now by the virtue of the authority vested in me as Justice of the Peace for the state of Wyoming, I now pronounce you man and wife. (chuckling) (clapping) - [Clyde] All right, thank ya, thank ya, thank ya, thank ya. (chattering and laughing) - I got married in my apron and my work boots. (laughs) (lively music) (rooster crows) (rumbling) - Hey, Sam! - How are ya? - Real fancy! - Yeah, it's not even good enough to suit me. - Hi. - Well, where's the new wife? - Ah, you'll be seein' her soon. - Ah, that serious, huh? Well, if I'm not too pretty, you can introduce me. - (laughs) I won't worry about the pretty. Come on. - Well, Sam. - Hey, Jack! (cows mooing) Stewart, damn it. Excuse me, ma'am. We've done this a thousand times. I guess we'll do it a thousand more. You know I can't give you more than I offer the Landauer. (laughs) How the hell could I offer you more? Well, there's been no rain, and the prices are so far down this year. - Well, we did business last year, and we'll do it again, but not this time. - Hay's sky high. - [Clyde] Well, we'll feed 'em through. - Clyde, this don't make any sense. Those people in Omaha are not gonna let me give you more than I give everybody else in this country. - Take the three year olds, that'll help some. But at two and three quarter penny a pound. Well, I'll not let the two year olds go. Ah, prices'll come up, if there's any justice in this country. - You do what ya see fit, but I wouldn't put my money on justice. (chuckles) Well, we'll run those three year olds in with the Landauer bunch. Ah, Miss Stewart, meetin' you has been the pleasure of my day. Jack, see ya! - Sam. (rumbles) - See ya later, Clyde. - All right, in a bit. - Hey, Jack, how 'bout a game? - Well, not now, kid. - Thrashin' at Needleson's tomorrow. Loan 'em a team every year for five years, and the damn meadow burns up before they get here with our team. - Well, we made her okay. - Oh, I figure we need about 70 ton of hay this winter, minimum. - Well, we only got 50. You know, Stewart, I've seen bad luck follow its own nose to the grave. - Is that right? Why are folks always afraid to try anything? Well, old man, how 'bout working with the yahoos tomorrow? - We got enough cash there for 20 ton of hay? Well, that does put things in a different light now. I ain't spendin' the winter out in the grub line around here. Nope. I got some better things to do. - What about the colts? - Don't know, Stewart. I'll see how things go down in New Mexico. Soon as I get my things, I'll be up after my pay. Shut your mouth, kid, before the flies get in. - I've got to feed the team. You pay him. - No. (door slams) (chickens cluck) Clean it up. - You mind your mother, lassie. Hah, that's a fine job. - Jerrine, go to the bedroom, and stay there until I say come out. She's yours, too, you know? - If you do not mind, I'll use a strap on her. - She'll mind. She's upset about Jack. - Ellie, listen to me. There were no wages. Jack knew that, that's why he left. We'll make do. (rhythmic lighthearted music) - Jerrine, give me your hands. - I feel it. (lively rhythmic music) - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - How 'bout some tea, hmm? - Okay. (lively rhythmic music) (wind howls) (cows mooing) - Mama? The coop's drifted in. I can't get to it. - Eggs must be about frozen. (wind howling) - It's frozen solid, the creek is. - The coop's drifted in. Jerrine can't get to the chickens. - Well there's a shovel by the door. - I can't. - You can try, miss. Where ya goin'? - To do what no one else will. - Stop. You shut the door, please. - You sure have your black boots on today. She's only seven years old. - Everyone has to do their part. (sharp thuds) (cows mooing) - I'm tryin' to sleep. - So am I. Why don't ya put Jerrine in the other bed? - No. She got frostbit today. - [Clyde] Bad? - What do you care? It was you sent her out. - What'd ya say? - I said she shouldn't have been outside. - That's not what ya said. You want to do it all yourself, always, but you won't let her. - That's not true. You're takin' this out on us. The hay's runnin' out, and there's no help, I can't help ya. It was you that got us into this. If Jack were still here. - If Jack were here, it wouldn't be any better. You still do not see. - Oh, I see plenty. I didn't marry those cattle. (chuckles) - You got what you wanted. Now you gotta take what comes with it. (breathing heavily) - Mama? - Go tell your father I need Grandma Landauer. It's okay, go on. (exciting rhythmic instrumentals) (wind fiercely howls) (water sizzles) - [Jerrine] When will they be back? - Don't you worry, honey. He'll be here with Grandma Landauer before you know it. - Oh, Mama, let's sing a song. - I can't sing to you right now, Jerrine. How 'bout we make up a story? What'll we make believe? - I don't know. - Well, come on. How about it's summer? No, it's early spring and there are some colts, newborn, runnin' in that field out there. And the creeks are runnin'. Hear 'em? Listen. You hear 'em? And we ride up into the mountains and along about sundown we build us the nicest fire, and we roast our potatoes. And then along comes Old Man Tinker, and he takes out his fiddle, and we sit by the fire and he plays and plays and plays and plays. (softly bubbles) Clyde! (wind howls) - She wasn't there. - Don't talk. Jerrine, get your father a cup of coffee. - Her boy, Deeton, froze up. She took him to Green River. (dramatic rhythmic instrumentals) (gasping and moaning) (groaning) (gasping) (groans) (baby cries) (baby cries) - Here, take your son. Come on, take him. - Ah, James, you're a healthy crier in the wilderness. Easy now. - You're never gonna live this down, you know? Clyde Stewart, who'd know just what to do with a calf, can't even spank his own baby. What're you gonna do with him now? - Hey. (chuckles) He's so tiny. - Helps him to breathe to yell right off. - Don't need help right now. - Maybe he takes after his mother. (baby cries) (soft thudding) What was that? - Just an old horse. - An old horse? He's so thin his bones show through. How'd he get here, Clyde? - Probably saw the light, come lookin' for food. We've nothin' to spare. Be better if I shot him. Don't waste your tears, Ellie. Your move, Jerrine. * And he walks with me * And he talks with me * And he tells me I am his own * And the joy we share * As we tarry there * None other has ever known (sharp thuds) (wind howls) (cows mooing) (baby fusses) He's been convulsing. - Well, wrap him up. (baby crying) How long has he been like this? - Just after you left this morning. Fever took him. Oh, Clyde, I don't know what else to do. - We'll keep him warm. He'll be all right. Easy, man. (baby fusses) Hey. Hey. - Mama? (water drips) Mama? (somber violin music) (water drips) (scritching) One, two, three, four, five, seven. (wind howls) (buzzing) - Where's your mother? - I don't know. (screams) (screams) - Ellie! She's all right, lassie. - Stewart is out with the cattle? Don't know how many made it through? No, stay, stay, I know where the pot is. In wintertime there's nothing to do, just wait. - You can talk to me. - I thought I was. - You know what I mean. (crying) (gentle whistle music) - What the hell you starin' at? - I came to see Clara Jane. The baby, did it? I lost mine in the winter. - Her name's Clara Rose. (baby cries) (thunder rumbles) (rain plopping) - How you do, Stewart? - Howdy. - I think the weather's breakin' up. - Yeah. - How many you got left? - I won't know til I get 'em skinned out. - How are the mares? - Lost half. Rest are fit, but I had to let Bubba go. - Hey, listen, old man, you throw in an extra colt, and we'll call it even til you can pay me. - All right. - All right. - Look, Mama, it's Jack. Hi, Jack! - Well, how ya been, kid? - Just fine, we got some new colts. - Yeah? - Come on, let's go see 'em. - Welcome back. - Got an extra place at the table? - Come on, Jack, come on. - How are those babies? - [Jerrine] Oh, they're doin' just fine, they're pretty. - [Jack] Yeah? - [Jerrine] Mm-hmm. - [Jack] What do ya have? - [Jerrine] Well, there's different kinds. - [Jack] Yeah? - Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive through thy bounty. In Jesus' name, Amen. (cows mooing) I can't stand that bawling. - Did you meet a lot of cowboys down there? - Ah, you bet, sister. Some of them old boys down there are pretty good. - Did you see a lot of rodeos? - Well, I, I did see a fellow who could rope a longhorn with one hand and a Brahma with the other. - Did you ride Diamond, Jack? - Hush, Jerrine, let the man eat his dinner. - Well, I'll tell ya, Jerrine, that horse don't ever want to see me again. Oh, I'm , I'm thinkin' of quittin' them broncs before I get myself all ruptured again. - What's ruptured? - Be quiet, Jerrine, now. - Rodeos are for fools who don't give damn about their animals. - For Heaven sakes, did you have to bring 'em down here? - The came here on their own lookin' for food. - There's none here. - You tell me somethin' I don't know. What am I to do about it? (door slams) - I figure they're about half gone. The grass is comin' green, and as long as they're on their feet they'll make it. - Half gone? - Yeah. Well, I guess a man blame himself. - Clyde, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. We'll just start over again. Borrow. - There's an end to borrowing. - It can't be as bad as you think. - How bad do you think it is? - I don't know, you never told me. - Well, I'll tell ya. The truth is there's 18 heifers, and 22 steers left. The place is lost. - I'll sell my place to Grandma Landauer. - You don't own the place yet, and she ain't got the money. - We still have the colts. We sell what's left of the stock. We'll start over. Clyde, Clyde, I'm your wife. - It'd be better for ya if you weren't. - But I am, and I'm stayin' here. I have a child buried in this land. - I've got everything buried here. My cows, my mother cows, they're mostly dead there, there, there. 10 years of buildin', it's gone. - At least we have the chickens. 13 of 'em layin'. - 14, you should know that. (laughs) (insects chirping) Ellie, Ellie are ya awake? (banging) - Yes, Clyde, what is it? - [Clyde] Ellie, I need your help in the barn right away. It's the heifer. Can ya come right now? - Yes, I'll be right there. - Hang the lantern over there, and come over here next to me. See, it's upside down. She's been at it since she went to bed. Ah, if I can get the feet, but I can't. Now come over easy over here. Now put your arm right, uh, here, I'll get the tail. Ho, easy now. See, ah, ya feel it now? Okay, ah, you feel now, now ya can feel the hooves. Right? - Ah, yeah. - Good. Try to put this around the hooves. I think I got one. Now let's see if I can get the other. Okay. Here, we'll pull. - Yes, okay. Come on, honey, come on. Come on, that's a girl. Okay. Come on, push, that's it. Ah, it's comin'. Come on. (gasping) Come on, come on, come on, open your mouth and breathe. Come on, open that mouth and breathe. Come on. (gurgling) Come on. Come on, come on, come on, you can do it, that's it! Come on. (sharp smacks) Come on, baby. Come on. (chuckling) - Ah, okay. (gentle instrumental music)
