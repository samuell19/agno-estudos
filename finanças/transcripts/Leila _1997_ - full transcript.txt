IN THE NAME OF GOD LEILA a film by Daryoush Mehrjoui Leila Hatami Ali Mosaffa Jamileh Sheikhi, Mohammad Reza Sharifi Nia Touran Mehrzad, Amir Payour Shaqayeq Farahani Parisa Zare'e, Vahideh Mohammadi Music composer: Keyvan Jahanshahi Editing: Mostafa Kherqeh Poush Script: Daryoush Mehrjou'e Producer & director: Daryoush Mehrjou'i Peace be upon the prophet Mohammad and his household. Don't burn it. - Turn down the fire. - We already did that. Easy. Wait. Bring the rose water Nazgol. That's enough. Don't pour any more, it's enough. People will say there's no color to the "Sholeh Zard" mother. Give it to me. Let Leila stir some. - The saffron is enough now. - Go, Golnaz. Pour the rose water. - Anyone who has a wish can stir it. - Should I pour it Aziz? Go on, dear. Say prayers while you do it. Peace be upon the prophet Mohammad and his household. Keep doing it. More rose water, Aziz? - Make wishes. - Oh, Imam Hasan. Make any wishes you want to. Let me taste it a bit dear. You keep eating, Uncle. But it has to be tasted, doesn't it? Don't move it too much. Go on, Hossein, go on, dear. - Hi, Hossein. - Hi, Amir. How are you? They're cooking "Sholeh Zard" over at my friend's house and he's brought you some. The guys are here, Uncle. - Uncle! - Yes? - Hi. - May it be accepted by God. - My friend Reza. - Hi, Reza. How are you? He brought us some "Sholeh Zard" Leila, Reza is Amir's friend, he's brought us some Sholeh Zard. Would you fill this for Narges, Auntie? Reza is one of my good friends. Welcome, thanks a lot. We were busy too. The first time I saw Reza it was during the cooking of Sholeh Zard Reza had brought a bowl of Sholeh Zard for my brother Hossein. Let's judge them all. I want to know where I'm standing. Who is better? Me or your friend Reza? A little of this and some of that. Have some of this one first. I'll test the one Reza brought first Amir is mutual. Which one is better honestly? This one is tasteless. Here, look at this one. We're one up as far as the sweetness is concerned. And as far as the decoration is concerned too and the color. The nuts are better too. This is grade one pistachio, Uncle. I married Reza in the same year. A couple of months later on my birthday, I realized I couldn't get pregnant. What is this? How pretty! Let me see, where did you get it? - They call him the big jackass. - Oh, Reza! It's so cute! - It's even as tall as I am. - It looks like you too. Where did you get it? Look at the hair. Is this mine as well? How pretty. - Let me see, give it to me. - Hold on, you're tearing it. What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? I'm choking. I know what you're laughing at. - Do you want me to tell you? - Go on. I'll tell you if you don't. - Go on. - Should I? - Should I? - Go on. - I will you know! - Go ahead. The night we were invited at your mother's house my husband's family knew it was my birthday too. So we arranged to go there first and then to go to my mother's house. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Come in. - Are you al right? Happy birthday. Why did you open the door dad? Isn't Mohammad in? He wanted to get the door himself. Why are you so late? I was waiting for you. It takes Reza hours to get ready, Dad. Come in. - Look at the flowers they brought you. - Thanks, Leila. - Hi. - Happy birthday. - Hi, my dear Reza. - Hi brother. - Hi. - How are you? - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - Sit next to me, Leila. - Okay. - Welcome, guys. - The traffic is horrible out there. - Reza driving and... - Leila took her sweet time too. How old are you now? What a question lady. About your age. I got you something small, Leila. I hope you like it. Without wrapping for your petite fingers. Dad! Thanks a lot, it's pretty. This is what's written on it, "The kingdom belongs to God". I also have a small gift for you, Leila. I hope you like it. I don't know what to say, Mother. It's a small thing, dear. Hopefully next year at the same time with your pretty little boy we'll have a huge party right here. We'll invite your mother and your brothers as well. We'll see each other here. I can't tell you how much I want to see Reza's boy. - Hi, brother. Hi, Leila. - Hi, Homeira. how are you? - Hi, Reza. - Hi, Javaher. - Thanks a lot. - This was brought from Mashad. - It's a small thing. - Thank you. - Here you go. - Thanks, Gol Mohammad. And this is my gift to you. And it's bigger than all others and more expensive. It's more recreational. Specially for Reza. - I don't know what to say. - It's nothing, dear Reza loves to drink tea. He drinks tea all day. And this is for you. But only if you promise not to make delicious food or my brother will get fat. Don't worry, he has a long way to go. We'll beat him up if he's a bad husband. Oh no, don't say that Leila, it's Farideh on the phone. - It's for you. - Thanks. Yes? - Hi, Leila. - Hi, Farideh. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. I wish you were here. - I've gotten you something small and I'll give it to you later. - Why did you bother? Just a small thing. Thanks. Say, what did the father give you? A chrysoprase ring. So he must really love you, then. The ring used to belong to my mother. - Let me see it later. - Okay, fine. - Bye. - Thanks dear, bye. I'm feeling great, God! I feel like I'm flying over the clouds. Thank you, God. Thanks. - Reza! - Yes? How many children would you like to have? Two a year. I'm serious. I don't know, what kind of a question is that? A hundred, or two. The more the better. - What if I can't get pregnant? - That's even better. So you won't divorce me if I can't have babies? Hear this once and for all. I want you for yourself and not for babies and anything else. This creature is called Leila. This creature wants to have babies. And not just one or two. But a couple of hundred ones. - Hi. - Hi. Happy birthday. - Hi, Aziz. How are you? - Hi. Why can't we carry on with this somewhere warm instead of freezing? How dare you say I've grown old? See how it takes me an hour to move this heavy fire-pan? Go on, Hossein, play on. Just a moment please. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to give Leila's present before dinner. Hold on. One of this is from me to you, Leila and the other one is from my dear spouse. - And it's just a small thing. - Thanks a lot. It's not my fault, it was her choice. - Aziz, I love you. - Leila, dear. Now to the next present. Your name and Reza's name both are carved on it. Thank you very much. I can't believe it. You should have done more. Nazgol's present. It's directly from Paris. Any more presents? Yes, from your dear uncle. A pair of canaries all in one piece. Thanks a lot. Well, Hossein's present. And this is from all the pigeons and canaries. The next day me and Reza went to the doctor. I told her that it was a while since we got married and that I still wasn't pregnant. She said it happens all the time, there's nothing to worry about. Sometimes it can be genetic and nothing can be done about that. But if men have the problem then there's definitely nothing can be done. But if it's the woman it's possible to do things with treatments or even surgeries to become pregnant. Nevertheless, I'll have you tested. Bring me the result and I'll know then. Next Sunday the same time. If you have a problem, it's not important to me at all. I'm quite happy with what we've got right now. But what if I have a problem? I'm happy with what we have as it is as well. What he said calmed me down a lot. I felt I was not alone. But promise not to tell anyone till Sunday. No one. I promise. Yes? - Hi, Leila. - Hi, how are you? - Are you al right? - Thanks, nice of you to ask. Where were you? To see the doctor? - Yes. - How did it go? What did she say, dear? He's going to take a test. - Is that so? - Who is it? - Which laboratory? - Is that mother? You'd have to be sure. He can't go to just any place Leila. It's not a joke, they might give him a wrong result. But you should know, Leila, that Reza doesn't have any problems. We've never had anything like this in the family before. Thank God Reza's ancestors all had all kinds of children, - and you know Reza has four sisters. - Give me the phone. I wish them all the best. - Hi, Mother. How are you? - Hi, Reza. This is not a good time for this mother. But I now you're not the one with the problem. - It doesn't matter. - What do you mean? It matters a lot. But we still don't even know what's what yet. Why don't you come here for dinner? - Thanks, but I don't think so, bye. - Bye. - Hello? - Hello? - Hi. - How is it going? - You're al right? - I want to talk to Leila. Parvin wants to talk to you. Tell her I have a headache. Can't talk Leila isn't feeling well and neither am I. What did the doctor say? We have to take different tests. Ask mother, she'll tell you all about it. - Can't you tell me yourself, spoiled brat? - Okay. - Okay what? - Bye. Hello? - Hi, Reza. - Hi, Firouzeh. Is it you? How did it go? Tell me. What's going on? Why are you so worried? I'm not worried but I do want to know. You'd have to wait for the results. I hope it's all good and well. But you need not worry, Reza. It's not a problem from our side. It makes no difference to us. It's six of one or half a dozen of the other, bye. Listen, Leila... Don't answer it, it's either mother or my other sister. - Don't be upset. - I'm not. Believe what I told you. Don't get carried away by what everyone's saying. I understand. You are the only son of the family after all. It's only natural you have to have a son. It'll be al right, hopefully. Let's not talk about it for now, okay? What should we do tonight, Leila? I don't know. Whatever you say. I think... Let's stay home, we'll cook something up. We'll eat, and we'll enjoy each other. And we'll watch a movie afterwards. How is that? Leila! Leila! Okay then, it's great. This must be my dear auntie. The train doesn't close down, important people are in it. You go on and I'll catch up to you later. Let's go, guys? Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up. You don't have any problems. It's from the lady. According to the tests. Your hormone count is very low and in order for you to be able to hold the sperms you'd have to produce strogens or progestrones. Is there a cure for it? I really don't know, I'll write you some medicine. You might get suggested various ways to get pregnant but. It's very unlikely with such a low count of hormones. One way to cure is pulsatale administration of Gonadotropin. It helps you produce more than just one egg. Six or seven until one of them comes through for you. Another solution is artificial insemination. Of course it's very expensive and it takes a long time and you'd have to go on the waiting list a year before doing it, but if someone can't hold the baby at all she'd have to lay down for nine whole months with no movements and take hormone injections. Yes? Hello. Sure, you can come over. Next week, yes. Don't worry about that. I've checked your test results. You don't have any problems. But do come here. I need to change your medication. No, no problems at all. Sure thing, bye. Leila! Don't cry outside please. For God's sake, Leila! Let's go. Where to? Home. But if mother should call, that I'm sure she will, - you talk to her. - Okay. And you promise me to forget this totally. I do not want a baby, and that's that. Please, Leila, don't turn this into a disaster. I swear to God it's not important to me. You know it. Leila! Don't cry, please. Nothing's for certain yet. Didn't you hear the doctor say that there are all kinds of cures and tests? Besides we've only checked with one doctor. I was busy carrying out the lady doctor's orders for a long time. I used to take hormone pills like crazy at first but they were no use. Next, I went to do the pulsatale administration of Gonadotropin but after going through a lot of trouble the daily examinations didn't work Reza no longer agreed with the artificial insemination and I wasn't too thrilled about Endoscope. Specially since I had to go on the waiting the waiting list for a year not knowing whether it would help or not. And during this period I was tossed from one doctor to another. And between new medications and traditional ones, everywhere. Even one day me and Reza went to an orphanage to adopt a child. A couple who come to us to adopt a child must meet certain criteria. They have to be Muslims and educated. They most certainly need to have economical, social cultural and religious conditions. Most importantly they need to show proof that they can't have a baby. In order to start a file they need to go to the city court and present certain documents there. And then they'll be referred to The Ameneh Orphanage once their residence is checked out. And once the family gets approved in every way they'd still need to go on the waiting list. That's because we are short on children and there are many families on the waiting list who request a baby girl. Small girls who won't have any religious problems but there's no way to tell and it might take up to two years. Just a moment, don't raise your arm ...tells the rabbit that he'd pull out its teeth if it went there one more time. But the rabbit goes again and asks for carrots and the guy pulls its teeth out. So the next day the rabbit goes and asks for carrot juice! Well, what do you think? I don't know, it's hard. They all feel to be strangers. Although some of them are truly angels. Why don't you tell him what's on your mind? Why won't you tell him that why do you want to raise someone else's child when you can have your own? You know what, Reza? I think this is very selfish of me in a way. You can have babies. Why do you have to raise someone else's kid? Who wants some kebab? Give me some tomato. Tomato is an excuse for you to eat the kebab, right? Reza! Careful not to drop the child. Okay, I'm careful. Poor thing hasn't had any experiences. It's not his fault. Poor baby, he loves children. I know what's going on in his heart. He's a mess inside. But he won't say anything since his wife can't get pregnant. His wife has cut his tongue completely. Whatever she says, goes. Are you here, Leila? Why don't you go and play? Are you al right? I have a headache. Why don't you go and lay down on that blanket, dear? - With the others. - Yeah. Do you really think Reza is tolerating me? I heard what you said I'm bewildered Reza has told me many times he doesn't want babies. Listen, Leila. I raised Reza and I know him well. If he doesn't say anything it's just for your sake. But deep down inside he loves children. So do I. Everyone loves to have children. What can I do though? There's lots you can do. I've done everything but none of it worked. Well, that's fate. It's not your fault but you can do a good deed. Like what? You need to do something. What? Be a good girl and let Reza have another wife. What if Reza had the problem? Would you have said the same thing? No, I don't know. I guess this is God's will. But do something if you love Reza. It's getting late. She's a mother, maybe she's right. I don't have any children to know how she is feeling I don't know what to do. Just say yes, that's all. - Say yes? - Yeah. Okay? Okay. God bless you, my dear. I wish the best for you. - I hope you become the happiest person. - What's going on? It's a good thing. Congratulations! I hope your second wife won't have the problem I'm having. There's no way to tell. I'd never have married you had I known I couldn't have babies. What are you saying? Are you trying to test me? Test you? To find out how much I love you. It's not a test. I want you and your mother happy. You have to have children and a second marriage is the only way. Didn't you see how happy your mother was? She shouldn't be. It's none of her business anyway. She got happy. What are you talking about? What's this all about? Are you really going to go through tolerating another woman in this house? Have you lost your mind? I hope you can understand how I feel. I understand you very well. I even understand how my mother feels. I understand how everyone feels, but why is it that nobody wants to understand how I'm feeling? How dare you and mother decide about what I should do? Shouldn't my opinion count as well? Why do you let others interfere with our marriage? What's it to them whether I want children or not? They keep telling you that you can't have babies. But why are you getting upset? I'm not. I'll throw a party. But you can have children and shouldn't waste your life on me. Don't worry, I know what's good for me. I've told you many times before and I'll tell you again. I'm glad we don't have any children. - It's better this way. - No, it's not. Fine, let's both commit suicide and get it over with. This is not the way to do it. Do you know how much you've been annoying me for? Medications, doctors, tests... I do not want any children and I don't want you this way neither. What happened to the old you? - Where are you going? - I'm going to see Hossein. - He can relate to me. - No. No one in my family knows about this. It will be horrible if they find out. Reza! Don't go. I'll change to how I used to be. Are you happy? Look. Like this. So many children in the world. Why can't I have one of them? Are you taking revenge? Have I committed a sin? Tell me. I'm stupid! God, forgive me! Right, he stood up to his family big time. He told them that it's nobody's business and that they shouldn't interfere in our life. Good for Reza, so he did stand up to them. Yeah, you should have seen his mother. She must have gotten really upset. You don't know how much better I am, Golnaz. - Good! - I feel like a load is off me. I feel like flying. I'm so happy. - So life's sweet. - Yeah. I'm cooking Chinese food for his dinner now. - How I envy Reza. - He'll have a ball. But don't make him too fat. Who is it? - Hi, Mother. - Hi. I'm so glad to see you. Too bad Reza isn't home. I know, I called his work. Come in, what a surprise. You never did this before. I hadn't heard of you for a week. I was starting to miss you a lot. I thought it'd be nice to stop by to see you. I'm glad you're here. - Here you are, Mother. - I'm tired. I know, let me take your hijab. - Thanks. - Here you are. I'll be right with you. What are you up to, dear? Cooking Chinese food Reza likes it a lot. You've forgotten all about yourself since you love Reza so much. You don't think about yourself. Don't bother yourself, Leila. I've already eaten. I just came by to see you on my way home. We have guests tonight. How is father? The kids? Everyone's fine. Would you and Reza like to come over too? - It's the auntie. - Thanks a lot. We're going to my mother's house. We haven't seen them for a while. Are you making pickles? Yes. I've made a lot of pickles this year. I'll bring some for you. Don't you bother yourself with anything. Thanks a lot, Mother. Thanks, dear. I've been meaning to give you this for a long time now. But I didn't find the chance. I was taking out my watch out of the drawer today and I remembered about this. My mother-in-law gave it to me at my wedding. So I figured it should be given to you. Everything goes to boys. Boys mean everything to parents. Boys are the cream of the crop. Specially to me since I only have one boy. God gave me four girls and a boy. I wish them all the best. Everyone has a different fate. Yes. Thanks. How pretty, Mother! You really shouldn't have! I never expected it. You don't expect anything from anybody. You are not a materialistic person, Leila. Why don't you put it on, then? It looks good on you Reza had told me how much you love pearls. In the old days they used to say pearls didn't suit everybody. They look good on some and not so well on others. It always looked good on me though. That's why you brought them for me. You must think I don't like you, right? Only if you knew how much I've prayed for you in order for you to get pregnant. All those nights I didn't sleep. I cried. I prayed for you. What difference does it make? You're just like my own daughter. I have nothing against you, Leila. But you're mistaken. You're young now. What about when you grow as old as I am? Reza will marry someone else eventually Reza loves children. He's told me many times. He's asked me to pray for him when I go to Mashad. To pray so God might feel sorry for us and give us a child. But he doesn't tell you any of that. He knows it makes you sad. Last year when Auntie Shamsi went to Syria... Last year when Auntie Shamsi went to Syria Reza told her to pray for him too just so he could have a child. He also wanted to go to Zeinab's holy shrine. What can he do though? He can't announce it in the media that he wants to have a baby just so you believe him? Leila, listen to me. I want what's best for you. Be a good girl and let us find a wife for Reza. Later on, when you grow old, you'll suddenly realize that Reza has gotten married behind your back. But then you'll be old and embarrassed. You'd have to hide yourself from the neighbors then. You don't know how men are. They can go through with everything to get what they desire, specially when it comes to having a child. This is not a joke specially in our family with just one son Leila, if I had another son. I wouldn't be begging you so much. Don't cry, Mother, please. You get Reza to accept it. I have no objections. But it's no use if I get him to accept it but you complain to him from the other end. I haven't said anything. Well, when men love someone even if that someone can't have a baby they love her no matter what. It's obvious. It's obvious Reza is in love with you. Is there anyone who doesn't know it? Okay, Mother. Whatever you think is best. I have no objections. God bless you, dear. I hope you get whatever you want in life. I hope all your wishes come true. I wish you happiness, Leila. What's that on your neck? Mother gave it to me. Was she here? Did she brainwash you again? She says you want a child badly but you're too shy to say so. I guess you've told Auntie Shamsi a couple of times as well. You've told her to pray for you to have a baby. But this goes back to the time you were going through all sorts of medication. I can't believe how mother takes advantage of the things I say. You can't fight the destiny, Reza. I want to hear you say it too. Say it, say you want a baby too. Is that you, Reza? Were you sleeping? Did I wake you up? No, turn on the light. I didn't want to ruin your sleep. How are you? Were you at mother's house? No, it's impossible to talk to her. I was over at your brother's house. - How was Mehri? - Not bad. But the kids didn't let us have a few words together. They were either crying or fighting or having stomach aches. And they kept calling their mother what they meant was that no one should talk or do anything else. Just sit and watch them. Don't talk of children anymore please, Reza. I swear to God it's not like mother told you. In the heat of the moment of medical examinations and all that medications and tests and all other things. I was stupid to say one word. I told her to pray for us and only for your sake just so you'd be comfortable. Why can't you understand it? Why do you insist on me marrying again? What do I need another wife for? The first time was by force too! My mother kept persisting about our generation not becoming extinct. But so what? What have we done for our people anyway? So many people in the world. One less won't hurt. What difference would it make? I feel you're growing cold, Leila. You're becoming distant. You no longer love me. What have I done to you? Nothing. But I can't go through it anymore. Our life's been revolving around the baby issue for the past couple of months. So many medications, so much worry. I'm tired, Reza. I have no energy left. Well, this is a kind of a medication. What do you mean? I keep telling myself: If Reza loves me he shouldn't care about another woman. She'll only give him a child, nothing would change, and that our love will keep on existing. Why are you putting all the responsibility on my shoulders? What about you? Me? I'm here. I'll be careful. I'll stay with you. I'm giving my consent and I'll go through with it. - Hello? - Leila! - Hello, Mother. - Hi. How are you? - How are you, dear? - Thanks for asking. - How is father? - Not too bad. Did you talk to Reza, dear? Hello? - Leila! - Yes? - Did you talk to him, Leila? - Yes. Will he do it? I'll make him. So should I start looking for a girl? Yes. I have one in mind as a matter of fact. I'll make the arrangements for this week. My sister knows a lot of girls. There is a colonel in her neighborhood. He has a nice daughter who has a high school diploma. They are a nice family. She's not very pretty but she's not a bad girl. I'll talk to my sister and set a date. - Okay, dear? - Sure. Is there anything else? Bye, dear. Bye. Mother called today. She said your Auntie Shamsi has found a nice girl for you. For marriage. She's the daughter of a colonel. What? She is a colonel? No, her father is a colonel. I guess she's not too bad looking either. She's not pretty, but... What if she's too old? I'm certain she's got dentures. And she's got rubber eyes too. And she's probably bald. With gold teeth. Only four on each side. She's probably got iron arms and legs and she tightens the screws every night. Mother called two days later and she set up a date for Thursday afternoon close to Auntie Shamsi's house. In Mirdamad St., near Mohseni Sq. Asef St., number 15 Thursday afternoon I helped Reza get ready myself as if I was sending my kid to school. I chose his outfit. His shoes, his shirt. He looked nice and shiny. He asked me how he looked. I told him he looked quite handsome and that the girl would certainly fall in love with him. What? Why are you laughing? How pure and innocent my husband's gotten. Just like a sweet and shy little kid. He's going to propose to a girl. Wicked! It's very stupid, isn't it? I can't believe you've gotten me to do this. Is this it? Next street. I'll hang around here for an hour. I'll do some shopping till you come. You will come, won't you? Everyone's after something but nobody can even guess what I'm doing here. Who can believe that I'm here till my husband gets back from asking a girl's hand? Well, congratulations. You should have been there, Leila. It was really funny. She's six feet tall with a bad attitude and old and she kept biting her nails. - Was she scared? - I couldn't tell you. Besides she has a slight nervous tick like this. - Stupid! - I swear to God. And then her father started to talk and asked me about my job and how life is hard and expensive nowadays. Next, the girl asked me whether I've ever been abroad. I told her that I have. She asked where and I said Italy, France, America. She asked which one did I like most? I told her that Iran is the best place to live but she suddenly frowned. But it was obvious they are a rich family. About a kilo of gold was hanging from them. I wish you could have seen Auntie Shamis. That's enough. Why don't you make your usual tasteless sauce tonight. To go with the grilled chicken? You know the one you mix them all up. - Yoghurt... - Sure, keep it up. - Hello? - Hi, how are you? Hello, Mother. Look, Auntie Shamsi told me all about it. You want a baby. So what do you care about her appearance? Besides you should thank God for giving you a second wife with so much gold. It'll be great for the future of your kid. What do you mean, Mother? What does gold have to do with a baby? What are you talking about, dear? Okay, don't worry - I'll find another girl. - Okay, take it easy now. I have to go now, bye. Reza had gotten super kind for the next couple of days and nights. He was trying to be too kind to me just so I don't forget he loves me and he kept on buying gifts for me. - Leila dear, Auntie Shamsi found a girl. - Yes. The daughter of the retired director general of the Ministry of Agriculture. She is 32. She's been married once but got separated after a year I guess her husband couldn't get her pregnant. - Sure. - Leila, dear, I'm sure this one is suitable for Reza. - Yes, dear. - Sure. We'll set a date for next week. And so we were off the next afternoon. And like the last time Reza wanted me to be with him as if he was going to take an exam. He didn't want me to be home alone and to annoy myself. But I guess I was getting used to it. Strange that I'm not scared. I can even imagine them all sitting around. What does she look like? No. No, I'll go crazy like this. I should look at these. There he comes. I missed him a lot. So? It was great. - Just great. - Really? She's a normal height. Very quiet and the type who is always keeping to herself. Then she told me about her marriage. She was in love with her husband but she divorced him since he couldn't get her pregnant. And no matter how much the man begged it was useless. That was when Auntie Shamsi started to sweet-talk. She told her that she did well by divorcing him and that life is hell without kids. And other bullshit and I was starting to get bored. I mean come on, I have a wife and I'm in love with her and I seem to want her more by the day. So what do I need another wife for? - Hi. - Hi. Well, to what do I owe this pleasure? - Reza and Leila are here! - We've been so busy. Yes, I know. You've been elected Africa's prime minister and that's why you've been so busy. Come in, here's your girl. - Hi, I missed you all a lot. - What a surprise! My sweetheart. - Hi, Mother. How are you? - Hi. Come in, come. Tell me how it went. - Not good. - Why not? I guess the girl divorced her husband for not being able to get her pregnant and no matter how much the poor soul begged her but it was useless. It seems she is very ruthless. - And? - And Reza didn't accept it. You don't know how painful it is though, Nazgol. I'm on pins and needles all the time. I don't know, but deep in my heart there's a wound or a pain somewhere and it's burning me up. Why don't you do something, then? What can I do? What do you mean? You can do lots. You can stand your ground and say no. You can say you won't let it happen. Besides, Reza too keeps saying that he doesn't want another wife. His mother forced him, so? What are you two mumbling about? Tell us about it too or is it about lovie-dovie stuff? Is it another girl? There goes the uncle again. No, Uncle, Nazgol is careful. But once love comes along you'll get down on your knees no matter who you are. So much for the uncle. He sticks his nose into everything. Nazgol dear, where is Leila? Where were you, sweetie? I was starting to miss you a lot. How are you? - How is Reza? - Fine. I always tell Hossein to stop by your house. - But he never moves. - Why didn't you come by yourself? - How is Reza's father? - He's fine too. - His mother, what about his sisters? - They're all just fine. Doesn't Reza's little sister want to get married yet? I don't know. Why are you standing there Leila? Have a seat. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - What's this? - For the kids. Do you have to work for them even when you're at a gathering? Where are you two going? Go after them, Alireza. Or do I have to do this too? I got stupid once already but it won't happen to me again. Besides I'm way ahead of you all when it comes to that. Am I wrong? There are lots of girls who'd love to marry me but I won't give in to marriage so easily. I have my conditions. She must have a house, a car and she'll have to fill my pockets up with money every month without me knowing it. On top of that, she must be young pretty and educated too. She shouldn't talk too much. That's right. But such a woman must be super stupid to become your wife, Uncle! What's wrong with stupidity? It's better than the brain you have, Nazgol. You and your fiance. You slime! You have nowhere to escape this time, Nazgol. - It's all over with. - Where are you going? Come in. Where are you going, Leila? You seem down. I'm a little tired. What do you want me to play for you? This is just fine. But mother wasn't going to give up. Three weeks later she found another girl. She is thirty years old. Her parents are both teachers and they work for the Ministry of Education. Her parents were decent people. But the girl... She was one of those shameless girls. You should have seen her. Her father began to talk and asked me about my job. I told him that me and my dad have an engineering company and that we have a decent income. Then the girl said. "How has your wife allowed you to have a second wife?" Well? And all I could do was to stare at her like an idiot so she had to answer her own question. What did she say? She said, "Right, she can't get pregnant". Then she said that having children without love in life would be meaningless and that how could you be in love with two people at the same time. And she told me to divorce you and marry her. - Just like that? - Yeah. So? I told her that you'd have to like her for the starters and that it'd be impossible if you didn't like her and that was when she got all quiet. Then her mother said. "So your wife makes the choice?" What else did they say? I told her that I was in love with you and how great you are and the only thing is that you can't get pregnant. Then the girl said. "Come back once you've divorced your wife". I told her sure, but don't hold your breath. That night we went to a Japanese restaurant again. It's just like engagement periods. It was great. We laughed so much while the food was being cooked. It was as if we had just met. Our house, our marriage. They all had a different feeling. I kept telling myself that this baby issue isn't so bad. I just realized how I can love someone. Now I understand that love is just like a living thing and it can grow. Where were you? I called a hundred times. We went out for dinner last night. We got home late. Where is Reza? Why didn't he go to work? Reza was tired and stayed home to sleep. With all the things he does it's no wonder he's tired. Why does he bother us so much? His Auntie Shamsi is trying so hard to find the right girls. She keeps at it but he comes along and rejects the girl. - Have you told him anything? - No, Mother. My girls are all so naive. I ask them if they know anyone but they say no and that they don't know anyone who has a daughter. It's obvious they don't approve of their brother remarrying. They don't even call to ask how it goes. I have to call them myself and tell them about Reza's dilemma. Hello? Leila? - Are you still there? - Yes. For the love of God. Tell me if you've said something to Reza to discourage him. I swear to God no. Reza isn't discouraged. You'll find a good girl. What was wrong with the ones we've found till now? Okay, I'll let you know. - Bye. - Bye. - Who was it? My mother? - Yeah. I wish I hadn't woken up at all to hear that bullshit again. Sleeping is great. I'd go nuts if it wasn't for sleeping. Let's run away and go somewhere else. Somewhere that nobody knows us. And we can have a comfortable life. This is all my fault. What do you mean? I wish you'd be standing up to me instead of going through with all this. I wish you'd tell me that you didn't want me to remarry. Why won't anyone understand that I don't need any children. I like my life just the way it is. But my mother doesn't want our family to become extinct. And so I'd have to do things I don't like at all. Ever since Auntie Shamsi started the hunt for a girl father's become very formal with me. I tried talking to him a couple of times but he didn't give me a chance at all. I was talking to him a couple of days ago in the car. And I told him, "Why don't you talk to mother?" He said, "I talked to your mother the very first day". She wanted you to marry Auntie Shamsi's daughter but you didn't. And now she's taking revenge. There are many couples who can't have babies but they kept on living their life. You tell me that you love your wife a lot and that you're quite content with your marriage but at the same time you go to various girls' houses to evaluate them for marriage. You should be ashamed of yourself! What sin has your poor wife committed? Do you remember what Leila told your mother the first day? She said what if it were Reza who couldn't have children? Would you have done the same thing? Tell me, what if you couldn't have a baby? What if Leila wanted to divorce you to marry another man? What would you do then? But I never said I wanted to divorce her. This is a kind of a divorce. You don't know what she's going through. I've heard you're upset and sad as well. Your mother keeps talking about you. That you're getting destroyed. Why don't you stand up to everyone and tell them you don't want to do this? What's all this, then? The problem is that Leila is okay with this. No, you're the only one okay with this. Not Leila for sure. Your mother and aunt keep saying that you'll do it next year if not now. They say you'll eventually divorce her anyway. I never said I wanted to divorce her, Dad. Bye. I realized how much I've missed father. I wanted to cry. I tried to stop my tears.. When Reza was talking I felt he was sort of jealous of my patience. And that's what was bothering him the most. But he didn't want to let it show. Had I acted differently perhaps Reza wouldn't be jealous at all. I know he loves me deep down. There aren't any women who can go through what I've been. God didn't give me any children but instead he's given me lots of patience. Mother started to come by after a few days again and we set a date for a day after tomorrow afternoon. You get Reza to go through somehow. Sure. Why don't you go with Reza to see for yourself? Everyone already hates me here as it is let alone if I try to go along with him for the proposal. Do something for God's sake, dear, so Reza accepts this one. We'll both be out of this misery. I'd better go now. How are Aziz and the others? Just fine, thanks. But they don't know anything about this so remember not to say anything to them. Okay, I won't. Besides, suppose they know, they'll realize Reza is only doing this to have a baby. They don't know I can't get pregnant so they must think Reza has a problem. What a shame! No, Mother, they think we don't want to have any children. They think we don't want it now. Very well. Bye, I gotta go. - The cab is waiting. - Bye. There's someone head over hill in love with you. He's trying to tell you something but he doesn't know whether to say it or not. What? He wants you to escape with him to the mountains to be rid of everyone here. Look, this is the mountain, this is the valley, and the escape route. You see? Let's see what does yours say. There is a woman in your life who loves you a lot. She wants you to have every good think in the world. There's also another woman waiting for you. She's young. She'll make you happy. What is it? Did mother call again? She came by. She's found another girl. She's twenty four years old. She knows you won't divorce your wife. She knows I can't get pregnant. The day after tomorrow at four. No, not anymore. I don't want to. Anyone who brings a child into this world is only trying to hide his fraud. He has to be crazy and madly in love with himself to want to bring someone else into this awful place. Why do you let others to interfere with your life? Do you even know what you're doing? I swear to God she doesn't know. She's way off. The day we went to the orphanage I told Reza that I preferred to raise his child and he said that anyone who was going to be his wife would have to accept his first wife. What do you mean? She might consent verbally but it's impossible. Another woman in your house? Who's supposed to have a baby? What if he falls in love with her? What would happen to you? Well that's why I say this is all a test if Reza's love is for real Reza? What about you? I've heard you even intend to raise the baby too, is that right? What about the baby's mother? What if she didn't let you? Show me a kind second wife. You'd be a step-mother. Don't you get it? Have you forgotten Esmat, the wife of Jalil? As soon as he married another woman she was forced to leave with two kids. No, it's different. - The woman Reza is choosing... - Is Reza choosing? Who the hell is Reza? He's just a man like all others. Do you know any man who doesn't like to have a second wife? Specially when a baby comes along too. And that's when the love for the baby's mother grows extremely. I don't know. But I do know that I'm tired. Suppose I say no tomorrow. What about two years later? Mother isn't and won't be giving up ever. Weren't you the one who said that once mother decides on something there's no stopping her? And that she's got a will of steel? Frankly I can't tolerate mother's stares anymore. And I don't want to be walking on egg shells all the time. Whatever she wants I give up. I feel this time is different. I feel everything will be clear this time and that I'll be out of this uncertainty. What will happen? Do you think everything will go on nicely and quietly? You idiot, get ready. And be strong. Don't be afraid. Don't shake. Well, how did it go? I guess this one wasn't so bad. Why do you say that? You've become very serious. What can I say? I'm embarrassed. Oh dear, are you now? Are you embarrassed because you've accepted this one? Have you? I don't know. I really don't. Congratulations. Tell me about it. Nothing to tell, her husband's dead. Normal middle-class. Very shy. I told her that I have a wife who'd have to approve as well. Her mother agreed. She said that she wouldn't allow it to happen unless you agreed. Frankly I really liked what her mother said. So what's left is for me to see her and approve. I guess so. I can't believe this. Unbelievable. Yes? - Hi, Leila. How are you? - Hi, Auntie. I'm fine, thanks. So how did it go, sweetie? Did he approve of her? Yes, he did. Thank God, then. - Put Reza on the phone, then. - Sure. - Hi, Auntie. - Hi, dear. - Did you like her? - Yes - I'll set the date in two days at six. - Okay. Her mother will be coming too. You know it's tradition. Okay, bye. The girl is coming at six in two days for you to meet her. Her mother is coming as well. Listen, Leila, should you not like her you'd have to tell me for sure. Because if you don't there's no way I'll accept it. What's wrong? You look like a statue. Listen, Leila, you are forcing me to go through with this but if you back out later and don't want to go on and if you leave me, I'll be devastated. Think it through. There's still time. It's beyond that now. Let's go out, I feel like I'm choking. - Hi. - Hi. - Well, my Leila. - Hi, Uncle. Hi uncle, how are you? Glad to see you. Long time no see. I'm glad you're here I want you to meet her too. - Who are you talking about? - Amir, a friend of Amir and Hossein. Who is Amir? He's the one who introduced you to Reza. He's coming over tonight. Why? He wants to ask for Nazgol's hand. That's great... - Hi, Leila. How are you? - Hi. - How are you? - How are you, Mehri? - Hi, Auntie. - Hi. Welcome. I'll be right with you. What's wrong, sweetie? Is something going on? It's nothing, Aziz. It's my blood pressure. I'll be fine in a minute. But why? What's wrong? I'll be fine. - Hello, Mr. Groom. How are you? - Hi, how are you? How are you? Amir is here. The groom is walking right in the trap, come in. Hello, how are you? - Welcome. - Hi, ma'am. Come in, please. Very kind of you. Everyone keeps telling you not to get stupid. You're just starting your life. Why are you trying to put yourself in a lot of trouble? - What can I say, Uncle? - This girl's putting us through hell. Nazgol will skin you alive. I'm telling you. The uncle is trying to bargain. No, living expenses are very high nowadays. And the uncle is raising up the ante. This is useless. - You are acting stupid, - Well... but I want you to learn from your dear friend. He's fifteen years overdue to get married. But he still won't be trapped. Where is Leila? Leila! Leila! Leila! Did you vomit again, dear? - What is it? - She might be pregnant. I don't know. What if she is pregnant? - My pressure's dropped. - What's wrong again? It's her blood pressure, Uncle. Her pressure? Where did it drop to? Why doesn't this ever happen to us? Let's eat dinner at least. Are you al right? Did you stop vomiting? No. What about your headache? It's better. Is this egg boiled? It's for you. You eat it, I'm not hungry. I'll pass by in five minutes. I really hope you won't like her though. There's no way I'll accept if you don't like her. Tell Auntie Shamsi not to say anything to me when she sees me. Why am I standing here? To see whether I'll approve of my husband's new wife? Who'll believe it? I'm not made of steel. What if I burst of sorrow? God. I felt a strange calmness by seeing her. I think I sort of liked her. She had a calm and pure face. As if she no longer was my rival. I don't know why but I wasn't my usual self anymore. I'd gotten strong. I no longer was scared of Reza being taken from me. - The green one. - Sure. - This one? - Yes, please. Well, did you like her, Leila? Leila, dear! - Do you approve of her? - Yes. She seemed to be a good and innocent girl. I sure hope she'll be good for Reza. Thank God. Well? Tell me how it went. Both families are supposed to have a gathering this week so the bride and groom can get to know each other better. Anyway, it seems everything's coming to an end nice and clean. - Listen, Leila. - This is "Shah Maqsoud". I bought it for you. Thanks. I can never understand women. They do anything they want to. I truly don't know what to do. Why don't you water the flowers, pal? - Bye, Leila. - Bye. Well, did you get a good look at her, Leila? - Do you approve? - Yes. My God. Why are you standing? Sit down dear. Sit. Don't be sad. This is my destiny. What is it, Homeira? What is it? What are you doing? Get out of here, now. This one and this one please. And so we went to buy the ring for the bride the following day since Reza's sisters wouldn't go with him. This is sapphire but there's a lot of gold on it as well. - How is this one? - It's fine. - Put this one on. - What for? I want to buy it for you. I don't want you to. Thanks. - Are you sure? - Yeah. How much is this one? Neither of us approved of it but mother is very sad. And Firouzeh thinks of the future. The wedding is in a couple of days. Should we go? Should we not go? So we want to ask for your advice. Of course, Parvin. Why not? Both of you should go. That poor girl is innocent here. You should even be present at her wedding ceremony too. Everything must go nicely. How are you? You're back so soon. I missed you, I didn't even have lunch so I came earlier to have dinner together. I got this for you. Listen to it and see if you like it. What's wrong? I don't feel too well. I'm not in the mood for this shotgun wedding. Did you go to Giti's house? Yes, with mother and Auntie Shamsi. We stayed there for an hour. Then I showed them the ring. I told them you chose it. - You shouldn't have. - Why not? They complimented you a lot. And then Homa and Firouzeh went to buy the wedding dress. The same place you recommended. Giti's mother invited everyone to her house for dinner. Dad called to see how you were doing. He was trying to make sure you won't be left alone tomorrow night. He told me to take you there. Reza! Reza is here, get ready. Why are you so late, Reza? I got stuck in traffic. - You should have left sooner, then. - We're here anyway. But it'll cause embarrassment for us. - What are you doing here, Leila? - Hello, Father. Let's go out, the weather is nicer out there. Let's go for a walk, why here? Don't stall. Homeira, this is too heavy. - Change your hijab, then. - It's fine, Mother. We're running late. It's very late, Reza. Run. Too bad you're not coming. Just what I said. Tell them she was sick and couldn't come. I hope they don't take it personally. They won't, take care. I'm surprised mother didn't even ask me once how I was doing. Doesn't she know what I'm going through? Can't she put herself in my shoes for even a moment? How selfish can she be? - Drink your tea, please. - Thanks a lot. I'm glad you came here, Leila dear. I'm glad you're not home alone. Have faith in God. Try to have faith in God in times like now. Until Tuesday and the night of the wedding. I started to clean the house. I felt I had to clean everything. I wanted everything to shine. Reza came home at noon. He was excited and restless. I cooked him some chicken kebab. But I had no appetite to eat. Neither did Reza but I insisted and he ate some anyway. He went to take a nap after lunch. He was supposed to go to the hair stylist and take a sauna afterwards and to get ready for the wedding. He returned in the evening. He was red and shiny. I had his suit ready on the bed. Don't stay home all alone for God's sake. Go to your mother's house. No I'll stay. I'll wait for you. I prepared the guest house for myself the last day. I was all numb because of so much pain. I thought that was it. I brought it upon myself. I thought no one was supposed to come Who are these people though? - It's tradition, dear. - Nobody was supposed to come! It's al right, dear. Don't worry. We'll be here for ten minutes. The poor bride has done nothing wrong. Congratulations. Excuse me. I sure hope you won't frown at me tonight, Reza. - Take some fruit and other things. - Thanks. You attend to the fruits, Shokouh. - Where are the herbs? - Here you are. - Now light it up. - What should I do? You take care of the tea, Goli. Bring the tea cups from there. Leila! Leila! Open the door, Leila. I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry. Go on, Reza. Go. Giti, I wish you happiness, dear. Bye, dear. Bye, dear. Thanks. Take care. Aziz! What have I done to be suffering like this? Why couldn't I have a baby? Why didn't you tell me? Why did Reza do this to you? Reza didn't want to, I forced him. But why? Leila, I had to tell them. I'm coming. Is Leila here? Hi. Hi. Do you hate me so much? You planned to get rid of me like this, right? Good God. I swear to God she forced me to do it. She wanted to make my mother happy. I wasn't important to her. I swear we were happy. We didn't need any children. We had everything. Everybody can testify to that. She didn't approve of a baby from the orphanage. She said that she wanted it to be my own child. Didn't you want a child as well? Yes, I did, Nazgol, but her child and not anyone else's. Do you really expect Leila to stay in that house and to live with your new wife? That's what she said herself. She said she wanted to raise my child. Why didn't you come to talk to us, pal? I tried to talk to Hossein many times but she wouldn't let me. She didn't want any of you to find out because you'd all get sad if you knew. Hossein, don't make so much noise. We're fed up. What do you want now? What are you saying? Leila must keep her promise. She married me and she'll leave my house only when she dies. I'll get Giti a house to live in Leila can come back to her house. Why did you go along with it if you didn't want any children? - That's exactly what I'm... - Why don't you divorce your new wife? I will, if Leila wants me to. Nothing's happened yet. I left the house when Leila left last night. I walked all night. For God's sake, Aziz. Do something! For the love of God. Uncle! Talk to her yourself. Leila! What are you trying to take out on me, Leila? What have I done to you? Why don't you answer me? Don't be so stubborn, Leila. You know damned well I did all this for you. You wanted it, isn't that so? Get up, Leila. Come back home. I promise to put her up in a different house in a couple of days or I'll divorce her if you want me to. Get up, Leila. For God's sake, get up. I'd never seen Reza so helpless and disappointed before. The way he was begging. But I'd turned into stone. Although I still loved him, but it was like someone dear who had died. I couldn't step in that house anymore. Reza called a couple of times and said the same things. Then his sisters came to see me. You've truly destroyed Reza. All he ever does is fight with mother. He says mother's ruined his happiness for her selfish reasons. Father keeps arguing with mother as well. He says that you can't be blamed. He tells mother that she ruined everyone. The newly bride keeps complaining that Reza doesn't pay the least of attention to her. I couldn't talk anymore. I had nothing to say. Everything was over. A week later Reza took his new wife to a new house and she got pregnant after two months. Mother was so happy she couldn't contain herself. She delivered the baby after nine months. A baby girl named Baran. Mother got sad all over again. It hadn't made any differences for Reza. The girl had told Parvin that Reza wanted her for Leila and now that Leila isn't here I don't exist either. At first I thought love could appear between us again but it didn't. Then I told myself that the baby might be able to save two people's lives. But now the baby is born. I'm prepared to get separated from Reza. And instead perhaps Reza might think that by stabilizing my life he could clear his conscious Reza accepted it. And he'll divorce her gladly and he'll pay her the dowry, and give her the apartment in full. The girl has money now. And after a few months she marries her cousin who has been wanting to marry her. And Baran stays with mother. I'm tired. I'm very lonely. Reza stopped by to see me a couple of times. He talked, and begged. He told me how miserable and how lonely he was. And how every corner of the house still smelled like me. And how my things were intact. And how ruthless I was. And how selfish I was. But it was all useless. I couldn't stop my silence fasting. A better life with less children. A shorter life with more children Reza was alone in that big house. He didn't divorce me neither did he marry another woman. But he was hopeful deep down inside. He'd told his older sister that this year on the 28th of the month of Safar when they cook "Sholeh Zard" he was going to bring some to our house like he did a few years ago to try and persuade me to go back with him in that house. Perhaps when I tell this story to Baran, Reza's daughter, someday she'll laugh. If it weren't for mother's persistence, she'd never be in this world. THE END
