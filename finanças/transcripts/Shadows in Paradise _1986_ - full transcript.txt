SHADOWS IN PARADISE Friday. - Have some. - I'm driving. Listen, Nikander. We've been a team for quite a while, but I've been doing this for 25 years. I'm getting tired, and so's the old heart. - What's the matter? - Never mind that. I've got an idea: My own company. Five trucks to start with, and then gradually - - Where does it end? - The sky's the limit. The state and the banks will back us. I know everything about this game, but I'm not going to die behind the wheel. Then where? Behind a desk. And I need a good foreman. 32.70. You're bleeding. I hurt my hand. We'll put a bandage on it. Come with me. Coming out tonight? Where? Somewhere fun. Yeah. How was the weekend? Great. I had a hell of a time. Did you give it some thought? Everything's ready. The bank's with us, and we've got a garage. - Maybe I should take a course. - Fine. Do whatever you think. I promised my wife way back that with me she'd get to see the world, and it's about time. It's fine with me. I could drive or anything else, if you think I can manage. Sure you can. I've got a slogan already: "Reliable garbage disposal since 1986." But that's now. That's why it catches the eye. - Pretty smart. - Isn't it? Who can put out the flame once it starts to blaze Underneath the hot, hot sun On life's highway you can see many pretty will-o'-the-wisps But there's only one I truly miss... Another. No more. No more? Good morning. Damn it. My neck's stiff. What happened? My job! Where are we? The door's locked. It usually is in jail. I could lose my job. - Have you missed work often? - No, never. Then you're okay. I don't even have a job. You don't? Why? - Why do you think? A position opened up yesterday. Maybe you could get it. What do you do? Drive a garbage truck. Okay. Melartin. Nikander. See you tomorrow morning. Be there at 6:00 a.m. Tomorrow. You'll be on probation for a week. Great. Now I've just got to be brave and call the wife. - Tell her you got a job. - It won't help. She'll hit me anyway. - Then why keep drinking? Makes me feel good. Makes things seem fine. - They seem fine? - Yeah. How about another? - No. - Why not? I'll call her after that. - If it helps. Listen, if you've got a problem - - Me? - Yes. - Who says I do? - Nobody. Of course not. Hello. Hi. I've always wondered who takes that away. Just me. Is your hand better? Yes, it's fine now. Would you go out with me tomorrow night? I work until 8:00. That's okay. All right then. I'll be here at 8:00. Good night. Who are these for? My brother's graduating today. It's only April. I've got a weird migraine. I gotta go. What's the rush? Let's go drink that somewhere. I'm in a hurry. Hi. Come in. - What's the matter with you? - Why? You look nervous. I do not. Don't you eat around this time? - Not today. The wife's out. - I see. So you're in no hurry to get home. None at all. How about a beer? - No way. - Why? Doctor's orders. A liar with a poker face. Admirable. See you. - Bye. Evening. Evening. Where shall we go? You decide. Bertha 1. Ivan 27. Ivan 19. What? Wait a minute. I don't think it'll work out. What won't? Anything. - Morning. How was it? - How was what? 104.95. You're wanted downstairs. No one can predict how market forces will change. Sometimes you have too much staff, sometimes too little. I'd have liked to keep you on. Yeah, sure. But there's nothing I can do about it. I just sit here and look at the sales graph. There must be a new supermarket around with special offers, so our sales will go down temporarily. You're the only one on probation. A supermarket's a merciless machine. I hope you understand. Your daughter finishes school in two weeks. She needs a job. It's very simple. You can stay two weeks. And the apartment? Two weeks. Then I need it for someone else. I think I'll leave now. Then you lose two weeks' salary. Thanks. - That guy is crazy. - What do you mean? I just got fired. Really? - Yes. - Why? Just because. Shit. Hi. Hi. - Let's go. - Where? - For a drive out of town. - Now? Okay, but I have to see a friend first. Why? That's my business. Let's go then. Hi. Lend me some money. And a clean shirt. - Okay. - Give me 500. - I haven't got it. - You got paid yesterday. - I paid the grocery bill. Goddamn it. Find me a clean shirt, will you? Good evening. We saw the vacancy sign. A double room? No, two singles. Please fill these in. Are you coming in? Now what... Nikander? I don't know. Are you hungry? Yes. Let's go to a restaurant and eat. Then I have to change. Okay. Change then. I'll wait in the hallway. - Pretty good, isn't it? - It's okay. Do you find it dull here? I mean... with me. Why? Just asking. Relax, Nikander. Everything's okay tonight. I don't know about tomorrow though. The weather might turn or something. What do you want from me anyway? - Me? - Yes, you. - More wine? - Answer me. I don't want anything from anybody. I'm Nikander... ex-butcher, now a garbageman. Bad teeth and stomach, liver barely hanging on, which is more than I can say for my head. No use asking what I want. I was just asking. It's all right. It's cold in here. Really? I hadn't noticed. Good night. Thanks for the evening. Come in. Breakfast. What's that? The supermarket's cashbox, but it's locked. Let me see. Is there money inside? There is. How much? How should I know? I can't get it open. Wait. Don't do anything. All you ever gave me was sorrow and pain But that's all right I can hide the ache I won't let people know for if you leave me now My heart will cry but it mustn't show What should I do with the money? It's a lot. You'll have to give it back. It was revenge. It's the third time I was sacked this year through no fault of my own. I thought I'd go to Florida, but all the planes were booked. Anyway, I couldn't get the cashbox open. My aunt's been to Florida. She says there's nothing there. All she saw was some Finns and Donald Ducks. They must know I took it. - I'll take care of that. That would be great. - I hope you know what you're doing. - Of course. Ilona Rajamäki? If you didn't take the money, why won't you tell us where you've been since you left work on Saturday? It's none of your business, that's why. You haven't been back to your apartment. We have witnesses. - Witnesses? Your former coworkers. You left immediately after you were fired. You were very upset. A cashbox disappeared. Sounds bad, doesn't it? - Depends. You're the only suspect. Shall I go through the questions again? Don't bother. I - Yes? What do I say if anyone asks for you? Don't say anything. Say I went back where I came from. - I thought you were a local. - No. - Where are you from then? - Down the street. I'll say you just took off. Fine. See you. - How much for a single? - Three hundred marks with breakfast. - And without? - The same. - I'll take it. - Sorry. - Why? - We're full. - You should have said so. - Why? Hello. Is Ilona in? No. - She's supposed to be. - Yes, but she left. - Where'd she go? - She didn't say. - Is that so? - Yeah. See you. We're closing. I have to go to work. I'll stay here and sleep. These are sheets and a towel. I can see that. I've gotta go. - It's beautiful. - What is? The sun, the sea, the birds. Gimme a light. Remember that chick from the supermarket? Guess where she is now. - Where? Sleeping in my bed. Get back there then. - I can't. - What's keeping you? Horror, fear and this job. I'll take care of things. Thanks. - Don't you know how to knock? - It's my apartment. What's your first name? I'm not telling. Why? Something wrong with it? Might be. Come here. Very well. You just got yourself a job. Congratulations. Our employees must be punctual. My secretary will explain your duties. I hope we'll work well together. - Evening. - Good evening. Will you be dining? Yes. Unfortunately, the restaurant is full. Is it good? It's all right. Want to go home? Sure, why not? - You can try it on over there. - Thanks. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I came to see where you work. Nice place. How about a coffee? I'm busy. I'll see you tonight. - Who was he? - Who? The shit collector. Just my cousin. Please arrange to meet him somewhere else. - I think I'll take a walk. - I'll just finish these first. I'd rather go alone. Let me have some cheese. When will you pay me back? I'll bring liver pàté sandwiches tomorrow. - Go ahead. - Thanks. You're welcome. - My mother-in-law's babysitting tonight. - Oh yeah? - The four of us could go out together. - Where? The classic thing: A movie first, then a bar. Get drunk. - Ilona won't come. - Tell her she has to. You're right. I'll order her to come. She seems to be late. Yeah, she does. I'll wait for her. Take your tickets. We gotta go. Can you make it home? I always make it home. Good night. Good night. Well? What? - Let's have it. - What? I didn't show up at the theater. Or the bar later. - I noticed. - Is that all you've got to say? - Yes. Pig. That's pretty weak. Yeah, it is. I can't help it if you've got a guilty conscience. - Why should I? - How should I know? Maybe you just got lost. Maybe not. I'll leave in the morning. Why? Don't you like it here? It's not that. All right. But why wait till morning? - Are you sick? - Yes. Mentally. - We've still gotta collect the shit. - No way. I'll make you some coffee. Bring me booze for a cremation. You'll be fired without a doctor's note. The kind of doctor I need hasn't been born yet. Are you coming? You still seeing that garbageman? No. He was kind of ugly anyway. What do you mean? He wasn't. - Really ugly. But nice. Maybe a bit strange. At least he wasn't as dumb as your men. They can't even walk and chew gum at the same time. - And Nikander can? - Yeah. And a lot more too. But it's too late now. Three 6s. Why do I keep losing? You've got no desire to win. - So what? You've got a kid, right? That's right. - How does it feel? - It's okay. - Want me to smash your face in? - You? No. - That's what I thought. - Why? - No reason. - Want to buy a video recorder? - I've got one. I can sell you one. - I don't need another one. - For your kitchen. My wife's in there with the washing machine. She could watch it while she cooks. - Have you suddenly lost your mind? - Me? I don't think so. Want to go out for a beer tonight? Can't. The wife's leaving for somewhere. They always do. Three 2s. I was pretty well through with the subject. I'd probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them. It's funny. It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun too, to be in love. Do you think so? It's funny. It's very funny. And it's a lot... Hello. Hi. I was just passing by. And? - How are you, pal? - All right. Want me to smash your face in? - No. - Then get lost. She and I have to talk. I'll wait in the car. I'm sorry. You've turned violent. Are you busy? A little. I'll bet you are. I'm going to see my sister. She was studying in Stockholm. Now she's in a mental hospital. Want to come? I don't think so. I see. I've been so lonely. Want to go back inside? Yes. You're very quiet. We tried to come here once but couldn't get in. Why didn't you call the manager? Us? I think I'll go. - Why? - I just feel like it. - Let's go to my place. You haven't been there yet. Thanks for the evening. Staffan... look here. What's up? Got a cigarette, buddy? Hi. What happened to you? Hi. It's nothing. Let's have a smoke. When will they send you home? I don't know. They want to test for internal bleeding. How are things at work? Okay. Mikkonen's truck broke down yesterday. We had to do his round too. - Overtime, right? - Yeah. 120 marks an hour. Have you called Ilona? No. Why not? Good question. Did you drive here? - Yes. I'll get my clothes. - I've come to take you away. - Where? On a honeymoon. You can't make it on your own. - You think so? - I do. - Maybe you're right. - Of course. Shall we go? - But my job - - We'll find you a new one. - What do you think? - Looks good. Pay at the cashier. Do you want to buy something? - Who's he? - I don't know. - If you're not buying - - Get lost. You heard him. Don't try it. Can you support us both? All right, then. Where are we going? They've got these cruises to Tallinn. I'll get my coat. Look up, my little friend See, the park is brightly lit My poor heart longs for you It's beating here all alone So hurry, please Oh hurry home Life is oh so short Hurry to me My love, my own You give me everything Hurry, please Hurry to me Everything here is yours But my friend, although I ask I know it's all in vain Even though I long for you Day and night Don't run to me Because you know too Life would only bring us pain Don't hurry back to me now The shadows here would swallow you up Don't hurry See the beautiful world Because here you couldn't see for the tears
