Good morning, sunshine. I'll check. -No, leave it. Don't worry, it's just the postman. Karim. -Fouad. How are you? -Good, and you? Where have you been all this time? Are you guys leaving? Say hi to your family. Poor boy. Farouk has erection problems. What? -The doctor says it's stress... but Nadya says he watches too much Temptation Island. What a beautiful car. Say, could you arrange something for my Yesin? He's good with numbers. I'll see what I can do for you. Where are you going to put the child seats? By that time I'll buy a new one. -You'll buy a new one. Bye now. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, Dad. Go home. Nothing has happened. Who's there, Abbas? -Nobody. It's me, Mum. -Ah, it's our Karim. Nice. Come, come. Dad, I'm not here to... -Come. Come inside. How are you? Have you slept well? -So-so. Fatima, she's back on TV. Would you like some tea? -No. Of course you do. She comes back home. What's wrong? Are you hungry? I've made nice pastilla. No Mom, I'm not hungry. Take off your shoes. I have bought some tasty almonds from... Jamal. -Right, Jamal. There you go. Sit. Say what you want about the Turks... but they do make great soaps. Dad, please stop. Here, enjoy. Have you seen what those Turks are doing? See, she's married to him but what he doesn't know... Redouan, where is he? Did you lend him money again? No. Karim, look. You've lost your job. Has he lost his job? This Turk is in all of those series. He's the... What's his name, Karim? You're ill. You have cancer. -Mom, please. It's that girl. Did you fight with... Lisa. Eline. Rinaldo di Caprio. He's the Rinaldo di Caprio of Turkish series. Dear, I've said it before. Dutch people are no good. Listen, I spoke to Khadija's aunt. She's all alone now. She's waiting for you. I'm not getting married. I'm never getting married. Not with a woman. Dad. I never wanted to do it like this. Go away. Please. Out. Karim, would you like something to eat? Is everything alright? Karim, come out. Look what you did. Mom, Dad. I'll stay here until we've discussed this. Are you still doing this? I thought I'd be doing it differently later. Karim, come out. Now. No more soccer for you. Go on, lock yourself up. Relax, Abbas. How can I deliver the mail now? He's still young. How much longer are you going to stay there? Until you've calmed down. Of all the windows you could break, you broke Fouad's. At least you did that right. Come. What's Sparta going to do, win or lose? -Win. Yes, win. Mum. -Yes. Hi Zainab, how are you? Dad. Yes, Abbas is going deaf. Listen. Just say your son is having some 'personal circumstances'. No. Karim? Yes, he was here. Yes, he's always busy. He should take some more rest. Even at night he's working. We don't see him very often. This dish brush is falling apart already. Buy one from Blokker next time. Why do you do the dishes? We have a machine. So the machine does it better than me? Maybe now you want to talk. Enough. Turn the tap back on. The neighbours. You're right. Get out of my house. Go. Dad. I can go away... but that doesn't make it go away. Karim, give me back my TV or I'll kick in the door. Enough. -Now what? Can't I yell in my own house? What are you going to do? -Call Mahdi. Mahdi? Why? -The imam will know what to do. Just like with Soufian? As if he has cured him from this. Where is Soufian now? The imam has told everyone and now Souf is dead. Good afternoon. Are you hanging up on the imam? -So what? So what? What if he has caller identification? Do you think Mahdi has caller identification? All phones have caller identification. Ours has it too. Put it on speaker. Hello. -Hello, Mahdi. That was me, just now. Who is this? It's me, Abbas. I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number. Did something happen? -Everything is fine. With Fatima too? -It's fine. Hey Karim, got a moment? Souf, what's up? I think I'm going to tell the family. Do you think that's wise? You don't know what it's like to live a lie, Karim. What would it solve? -Don't know. You're probably right. Then I'll have no-one left. Exactly. Don't do it. Never mind. Hey listen, you need to choose. A woman with three tits... or one with a really long tongue. Yo, Souf. -Long tongue. No, man. Three tits. What are you eating? It contains pork gelatin. Says the biggest pig of us all. And this, isn't this haram? -There's nothing about it in the Koran. Nothing about winegums either. Smoke your joint. Hasheesh is cultural heritage. We need to strengthen the Moroccan economy. Even if you ate a whole pig it wouldn't matter. Bro, go smoke outside please. Go smoke outside. Piss off. I've got one more for you guys. What if Soufian is a Christian? No, wait. A Jew. Dude, what does it matter? Shalom, salam, kosher, halal. And what if he would be paralyzed? -God forbid. Drooling, dirty diapers, crapped himself, full of shit. Would you still have his back? -What are you saying? Then you have to wipe his dirty ass. -Are you talking about your Dad? Shame on you. Leave my Dad out of it. Yo bro, I got your back. With or without a diaper. With or without a diaper, have his back. Abbas. Ah, Fouad. -How are you? Doesn't your WiFi work either? -Sure it does. What about your TV? Have you reset the modem? And you, have you reset your modem yet? Yes. Didn't work. Then it won't work here either, don't you think? Oh, I smell pastilla. We should change the password too. Any moron can guess it. The water suddenly stopped running. Could be the main valve. I haven't been in the closet. You? -I never touch the thing. Have you paid the bill? That's it. I forgot to pay. I'm sorry. I just came waltzing in. Bye. -Come and have a drink outside. Inshallah. Anything? -No. Yes, we have reception. We did it. That presenter should eat more. I can't stomach that Dutch food either. They plundered the world for spices but they don't ever use them. Mom, Dad. We need to talk. Mom, please don't open the door. Hi Zainab, how are you? -Alright, and you? I made too much food for the boys. It's a pity to throw it away... so I have some leftovers. Broccoli... Thank you. Listen, Zainab. Don't believe that old gossip. It was a misunderstanding, about the water. Really? -Yes. Thanks. Soon I'll cook for you. -Alright. By the way, did you mention my niece Khadija to Karim? Karim is quite picky. So is Khadija. She's smart and tidy. I'll send you her Instagram. I'll talk to him about it. Power failure. Happens once in a while. Yes, power failure. I've got risotto on the stove. I'll call you later. Thanks. Really, embarrassing me in front of all the neighbours? Mum. Do you want to talk? Talk, just like those Dutchmen. Do you know what you're asking? A little understanding, Dad. What is there to understand, my son? We'll be stared at. We won't dare to go outside. Remember... how we used to go fishing? You told me what you wanted to do when you grew up. You'd always say: 'Later I want a woman who's just as smart as Mum... but mine does listen to me.' And I want children. Three children. -Three? You say exactly what he wants to hear. Exactly that smile... That's what we always go for. I'm just being me. You're lying. -No, you are. We're lying. You're confused, Karim. We can get help. We can. There is nothing wrong with me. Then stay there... and turn the light back on. Hey, man. I can't stand it anymore. But things are good, right? You've got a nice house, pretty wife. Dude. Don't you start too. Everyone knows you were confused. Is that why you don't call me anymore? I can't even look at her... when I touch her. -Hey, Souf. You can do this. You have to, Soufian. You have to. You don't have my back, Karim. You don't have my back. I expect this to be over by tomorrow. I layed down a blanket for you. So what are you going to do now? Nice going. As if you have a better plan. Dude. I'm ten years old. There he is. Hey. Do you want... Are you okay? Sure. I'm great. You don't look like you're great. Let's sit somewhere else. No, I like it here. I'm Kofi. How? -Kofi. Like the drink. Like the drink. I'm Karim. Like... Coffee cream. Cream. Karim. There's food and stuff in front of the door. There are candles burning. At your place maybe, babe, but with us Mocros it's a reason to worry. The tap's not working either. Fuck, I've got to go. Who's there? Hello, who's in there? Redouan, you're waking everyone up. Karim? What the fuck. Shit. Just like back in the day. Open up. Hey, open up. Hello. Open up, my friend. 'Sup, bro. So this is where Mum and Dad hide all my spray cans. Come and sit, bro. Look. For you. -No, thanks. Sorry, bro. Tell me. I don't know where to start. Maybe right before you thought: 'You know what... today I'll lock myself under the stairs.' You know that Mum and Dad keep going on about getting married. Oh shit, are you marrying Eline? Listen, they'll come around. You'll see. Have you got a new chick? A Dutch one like me? Oh no. Is she a Berber? Yeah, they are feisty, bro. I'm telling you. No, man. Is she Surinamese? Now I understand completely. But I won't lie. Those Sranang chicks are really hot. Right? I've tried. Really, I've tried but I'm not attracted to women. What? Are you into men or what? You're into men? You think you're funny? Redouan. Fucking faggot. -What did you say? Dirty faggot. Fuck you in the ass. Fuck me in my ass? Who had to fight for you because you couldn't manage by yourself? This fucking faggot. After all these years. Redouan who can't do anything. You with your big car, your expensive gifts. Acting all chic and stuff. Congrats, bro. Now you'll feel it too. Nobody looking you in the eye. Where were you when I got shit all over me? Nowhere. And now you expect me to pity you. Fuck off, man. Redouan, go upstairs. Why me? Why not him? Because this isn't his house anymore. Go. Souf. God bless his soul. What a terrible accident. Thank you. -It's God's will. God's will. He always talked about you. You were dear to him. Abbas, he's gone. Where is Soufian? He was next to me on the photo. What happened to him? You can't even say it. Nobody understands what was wrong with your cousin. I understand exactly what was wrong with him. If I go on like this, soon you can cut me out of pictures too. You have no right to blackmail us with your life. Easy, Fatima. What? Did you hear what he said? Yes, I heard. We really can't talk about anything. I can't do this anymore. This is my limit. We have to resolve this. Do you want a pancake? No. With a bit of peanut butter. You like that. No Mom, I don't want them. Maybe you were right. We should have stayed in Morocco. You cried whenever we left Morocco. Mom, you know better. What do I know about these things? How should I know? Everything. You knew all about it. For a long time. Souf. Karim, dance with Zahra. Come. Be a man. Come. Dance. As if you ever listen to me. You never listened to me. All lies and you know it. You and Dad. Be honest. Are you happy? During my studies in Casablanca I met a boy. He was smart, funny, handsome and sweet. We were always together. He took me to Larache once, secretly. To the old amphitheatre. He waited until no-one was around... and started to sing. He'd written the song himself. But the poor boy couldn't sing one bit. Nevertheless... he made a lasting impression on me. And then? My parents did not accept him. It was just the way it was. My parents did not accept him. And now you want to ask me to do the same? It was just a crush. Now I have a relationship with your father. I've learned to love him. That's life. You could learn too. You know that it's never enough for Mum. This is Eline, my colleague. Eline had forgotten something. -Yes. There it is. Your perfume. Alright, well... Eline is the women who... Your girlfriend. Was that so hard? How nice to finally meet you. Karim has told me so much about you. The toilet is that way, right? -Yes. Mum. Nice woman, huh? Good for now. We'll find you a better one. Karim. Are you sure this is yours? It's okay. Of course I'm okay. I'm okay. My cousin is dead. Okay, just let's go. I don't need... Oh, look at that smile. So where are you from? -I'm from Ghana. Have you been there? So where are you from? My parents are from Morocco. Have you been there? Yeah, it's beautiful. -Beautiful like your smile. Hey, Karim. Long time, man. How are you? It's fucked up what happened. I've tried to reach you, but... Yeah, man. What are you doing here? I parked my car there. I mean in Amsterdam. You're too smashed to drive. -He will get home safely. This is... -Kofi. We're going to Club Air, you want to join? Why are you acting so two-faced? Two-faced? -You know what I'm talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. -Where were you? What are you on about? -Where were you? Leave it. Take good care of yourself. Karim. I'm only trying to protect you. Are you trying to protect me or yourself? Let Dad help you. We don't need help. Look at him dancing. Don't speak with your mouth full. -What did you say? Don't complain if your children start doing it too. Redouan is starting to walk well, right? It's okay what you are feeling. Son, we don't want you to lead a troubled life. This is my life. Every day I'm thinking: am I too weak? Do I move, talk and breathe normally? I hate myself enough as it is. I don't need you for that. Hello, Abbas. -Hello, Mahdi. What is this? -The mosque has collected money for you. When you called I didn't understand you had problems. We don't have problems and we don't need help. I have money. Where are you going? I can't take a shower. Clean up the rubbish outside the door. Where are you going? It's your day off. Otherwise they'll just keep bringing us money. What money? -Shit. Good morning. Good morning. What's all this? Ask your brother. They know exactly what to give away. Why are we getting this? Because Mum and Dad are afraid to tell the truth. And for good reason. I told you to close the curtains, right? What do you want to drink? These are my curtains. My fucking curtains. Right? What the fuck, Karim? Sorry. Phone dead. What? You're beautiful when you're jealous. We'd really make beautiful children. Hey. Calm down, you. Shall I give you a foot massage? Shall you return those flowers to my neighbour first. Who's K? Who's K? Who the fuck is K? Your gay friend? -Redouan, leave it. Yo, hello. Yeah, this is his brother. -Redouan. Hang the fuck up. You should come over. My parents are dying to meet you. Otherwise send me your address, then I will come pick you up. Redouan, let go of the door or I'll stomp you in the face. Kofi, please hang up. Hang up, Kofi. Loser. I'd already hung up. Sucks when people lie, right? Mum always knew. Fuck this. What are you doing? -I've got one hour. If you only got one hour, there's the remote... and your favorite double-vla is in the fridge. Come, I've got a whole day planned for us. I can't. I... What is this, Dutch or English? Come on, let's go. Karim, listen. I know a place where I am certain that nobody knows you. How do you call a family man in Dutch? Burgerlijk. I'm not even gonna try. This language of yours. I was always good at winning prizes for my brother. What about your brothers and sisters? I think I should consider a season pass for this funpark. Look who's having fun. Mister Burgerlijk. What the fuck? Come on, nobody here cares. -I fucking care. You've got to let it go one day. -What? Eline. -She's not the problem. So who is? Karim. Yes. Hello, Fatima speaking. Yes, number 60. Yes. See you in a bit. Are you getting visitors or have you called a doctor for me? A lot of talk there in the cupboard. Come in. Come. Sit, Lisa. Eline. -Yes. Eline. You said Karim was here. -Yes. He's here. Karim? Karim? Eline. A nice cookie. What am I here for? Let's talk some other time, please. So this is how you wanted to dump me. Has your mother found the right little bride for you? Karim, please. Are you dumping me or what? If there was one woman with whom it might have been possible... Fuck. Now you're telling me. In this way. I wanted it. I really tried. Habibti. -Don't habibti me. I'm here because you're acting so uptight. You talk to each other, damn it. -Eline. Did you really think this would help? She's a nice woman, right? You could learn to love her. I don't want to lie anymore, Mum. The truth isn't always the solution. Listen, my son. Marry her. You can do your thing on the side. No one will see it. It's your business. Didn't you see what just happened? What do you want from me? Some things are just the way they are. You can't force them. If anyone can force anything it's you. Remember Hicham's wedding? Why are you bringing that up? Uncle Hasan had created a men's corner and kept Dad there. Mum says you have to come. The men stay here. You were fed up with those old-fashioned rules and you came to pick Dad up. Abbas, come. They're making a family picture. Zainab asked for you to come and Khaddouj for you. If you want to you can change all the rules. Everyone has to make sacrifices. Just like you sacrificed yourself. The things you do... are haram. Really? Now you see me. What, you were here? -Karim, stop it. You're not that high. You don't react to my phone calls, my messages, nothing. Hi hon, are you joining us to club Church? -It's an underwear party. So this was it. You're running back to what you're used to. You're fucking around and then you're acting straight. Listen. I don't know what you want from me... but I don't fall in love. Okay? And these are just good friends. Hakim, are you coming? -It's Karim. We could have an afterparty at my place. Yes, go. Have fun. And do me a favour, just stay away. What is this? I was at Hicham's for lamb cutlets and he wanted to give them away for free. I said: Why for free? Give me the whole lamb. We've got money. Yes, dumbass. Money from the mosque. And Karim? Yes, your son Karim. Didn't it work out with Lisa? Bring back the lamb. -The money goes back. The lamb stays. Abbas. Postman Abbas. -That shithead again. Neighbour. -Where's Karim? He went home. -His car's still there. He can't park there, can he? -No. Nice lamb. -Yes. Something to celebrate? -No. Sparta didn't win this season. I know. I just saw Eline leaving. How come you know her name? Everyone knows about Eline. Children nowadays are self-willed. Is Karim organizing a wedding party? Inshallah. Inshallah? -Of all possible answers? Inshallah? What should I have said? -The truth. That I'll never get married. You're going to get married. Maybe not now, but you will marry. Dad, I told Eline everything. -Well, not Eline then. Couldn't you keep your mouth shut? -Since when does 'inshallah' mean yes? 'Will you come to my birthday party?' 'Inshallah.' 'Could you help me move?' 'Inshallah.' 'Will you pay back my money?' 'Inshallah.' Dad, you're only making it worse. I've given you everything. Everything. Think I wanted to leave my parents? Stay in this cold country, delivering mail? Mum could have earned much more as a doctor, but no, you had to provide for us. Leave me out of it. Mum, you could've become anything. If only you'd learned Dutch like you speak Arabic. If the Dutch knew how smart you are they wouldn't talk behind your back. Let them talk. I'm happy with my life. I can stand up for myself. It would be great if it were true. Enough. Shut your mouth. Why do you want us to make the same sacrifices? Take Redouan. Everything he did was wrong so he ended up doing nothing. Works at the helpdesk as Matthias Cohen. He's 25, still lives at his parent's and is seldom home. You think you're better than him? -Where is he? Do you know? You're tearing this family apart. Watch what you're saying. Your sons do what you want them to do and pretend to be happy. You love Mum so much you put her in a cage. Dad. What are you afraid of? That I'm not a real man? That I won't give you a grandchild? Or is it your pride? What I'm afraid of? That I won't meet my son in heaven. Hi, Dad. -Everything alright? Sure. Is something wrong? What time are you coming for dinner? I'd rather not come today. Alright, son. See you. Leave the dishes. What do you want to eat? I'm not hungry. Thank you. You'll always be my child. Bismillah. Those are my cookies. You sure have a big mouth behind that door. Brokeback Mocro. What are all those sugar cones doing outside? Getting married after all? What? Aren't you going to congratulate me? -With what? I already have a new sis. Don't you get it? Sissy: gay. Why are you swearing? You are gay, right? I'm straight, so what's your problem? You're stoned. -Yeah. But that will be over tomorrow. Yo, little brother. You don't have to understand me. You really don't. I understand that you're angry. Or disappointed. I should never have lied to you. Never. I'm sorry about that. Redouan? Wake up, dear. Help me make breakfast. Take the plate to the kitchen. Turn on the water, will you? -Nothing has been solved yet. Sure it is. It's done. Good morning. Stay here if you like. Good morning. -Good morning. What would you like to eat? What have we got? Are there any eggs? Redouan, could you check if there are more outside? Hey Fouad, what are you looking at? That black guy has been standing there all morning. Don't trust them. If you see another one, call the police right away. Do you think he put all those sugar cones here? I have to go. Bye. What was that chicken clucking about? There is an Antillean outside. He's texting. He's gone. He's still there. -He's gone. I'm going. Is that K? How dare you bring him here? You have no respect. Redouan. Dad, please open the door. -Stay there. Redouan. Redouan. Who was that? What are you doing here? Did you fuck him? Did you? Wake up, Karim. I tried, but you... You make me disgust me. You want me to change myself? You already have. I'm not leaving everything behind like you did. Then go, and drag your girlfriend into your black hole... and go to your fucking family who will never ever accept you. You ran away, you fucking coward. You are empty. Karim? What happened? What have you done to your hair? -Mum. It's okay, dear. Talk to us, Karim. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. Karim. Karim. Hey. No more running. Okay? No more running. It's a bit... burgerlijk. Good morning, sunshine. Redouan, pass the butter. Of course. Are you taking part in this? You said I'd always be your child. Dad, I'm sorry you saw him like that. I didn't want you to meet Kofi like that. That's his name. Kofi. I gave you those. So they are... gay plates. Are you fucking crazy? Sit. Gay vase. Gay radio. Gay TV. Karim is gay Get out of my house. I don't want to hear you anymore in this house. You've destroyed this family. You've destroyed everything. Do you hear me? You've destroyed everything. Why did you do this to me? Why are you doing this? Why? -Please, Mum. Abbas. Do something. Do something for God's sake. Karim. Come. Come, son.
