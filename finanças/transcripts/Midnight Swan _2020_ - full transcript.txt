Stop crying, sweetheart. Otherwise, the makeup will be ruined. But... But... You're still young, you'll find another love in your life. It won't be the same, he was the perfect one for me. You'll be luckier next time. Like when I first met my boyfriend, it was a miracle. Boyfriend? You mean "sugar daddy"? Huh? How dare you? We're strong, we won't give men victory that easily. True words. And here we are! - Cheers! - Cheers! Nice to meet you all! So, it's your first time here? Here for buisness? - Yes, we're staying for one night in Tokyo. - Our agenda is full. So, are you all men here? Not anymore! They called us "m-e-n". Look at him, so tanned, masculine, and handsome! - Do you play golf? - No, I surf. Oh my god, you're so cool. Let's get together! Here we go again! She's a minx, ignore her. She falls in love in seconds, I apologize on her behalf. Hey, take me with you to the beach. Oh, be serious. How beautiful though, the sea. - Right? - I went there once on a school trip. And started to cry when I had to wear boy's shorts. Seeing as it went as such, I'd like to return. Wow, what a somber atmosphere. It's just like you, Nagisa. However, I understand what you mean. It's freezing! I know. - What the hell? - What the fuck are you looking at? Want me to smash your face? - Leave it alone. - Come on, stop. - It's repulsive. - Bitch! I work my ass for you! Hurry up and open it! Get a move on! Ichika. Ichika. Ichika... Your mother is very, very tired. Am I a terrible mother? Ichika, I'm sorry. I want to fix things, but I'm just unable to. Keep pressing, ok? Tell me, how kong has it been since you've last visited here? - One year and a half. - So long? Why don't you do it? - Maybe with a loan? - I'm saving up. You need a lot of time to save enough money, right? Be more focused. Are you there, Kenji? Yeah, what is it? How are you? Fine. It's been quite some time since you last called. What do you want? Remember Saori, your cousin? Yes. And Ichika, Saori's daughter? She's already in middle school. I don't remember, so what is it you want? Saori has been... How can you say? A negligent mother. She doesn't know how to do anything except drink and create problems. So... I actually called to ask a favour. Your looks resemble those of your mother. Hey, can't you walk any faster? Are you coming or not? I don't care either way. To tell the truth, I hate kids. If you say anything about this to your family, I'll kill you. I usually leave the keys down here. Come in, quickly. Shoes in the cupboard. Keep the room tidy. Find a spot to sleep and make sure to not leave your futon around in the morning. You can take a bath. Do it when I'm not here. Feed the fish when I'm gone. About your schooling, my mother is dealing with that, so if you want to go, go. Any questions? I'll leave the keys here. I can't tell what she's thinking. It irritates me. Was she mistreated at home? Yeah, someone reported her mother. What, like you see in the news? - Exactly. - Oh, wow. They're at table two, please. Do you take care of her? Why me? And also, why didn't you refuse? - If only I had done it. - Tell me about it later. - Nagisa and Mizuki. - Pleased to meet you. - Good evening. - Please be seated. - Wow, just look at them! - Beautiful. Thank you. Just so beautiful. Listen up, these guys are in the show buisness. - That's right. - That's lovely. These girls have just recently joined our agency. They'll learn from you guys. - My my, how captivating. - Stunning. You should be ashamed to let these men put you down. - That's not nice. - But it's the truth. These fags make all the effort just to look good. So, she just transferred to our Hiroshima school district? I have these documents. - Huh... pardon me... - What's wrong? What kind of relationship do you have with Ichika? We're relatives. Do I look like the mother of a girl her age? Uhm... you'll only be staying with us for a short while, correct? Yes, any problems with that? Well, uhm... No. It's no trouble at all. Goodbye, then. All right, that'll be everything. On your feet! Kneel. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Come on, ask her. Ask her yourself. Hey, was that your dad, or maybe, dare I say, your mother? Is it on TV? He's a transvestite, right? Why don't you try dressing like a girl as well? Impossible. I couldn't pull it off. - You'd look good. - No way! We've got to do the essay by today. Do you think Mika will be strict with us today? Like that other professor we had one day? Yeah, she was really harsh. Don't worry so much, I think she'll be a really nice person. - So have you decided? - I don't know whether to do the essay or not. Hey, let's do it together! Well, maybe I don't feel like it. You've already written a bit, don't quit now. Mika Dance School Open Registrations See you later. Chassé is too heavy. Sakura, glissade Allongé your arm. Next, prepare yourself. Rin, assemblé 5ª. Arabesque Now, use the floor to your advantage! Good, that's all. We're finished for today. Révérance. - Thank you for the lesson. - Stay well. - Rin, could I have a word? - Of course. - You want to become a pro, right? - Yes. Then, straighten your posture, like this. - Got it? - Yeah. Wait, just a second. My, you walk fast. Take this, if you want. We also do trial lessons. What a strange girl. Ichika is going to school. Thanks. Otherwise Ichika could end up in the news, right? Send me the money you promised. Life is not all roses and flowers here. I get it. I'm gathering the amount with the help of my family. Okay. Goodbye. Come here. The school called me. They're summoning me. Is it true you hurt another student? Listen to me. I don't give a shit what you do at school or if you become a delinquent. But don't create problems. Why can't you behave for just a while? Tell your teacher I'm not coming and I'm not apologising. Another thing. I had asked you to clean up. No. Come again? No. You're pissing me off right now. You are in my house! I didn't ask to be here. If you don't clean up, you might as well leave. Hey, how did the test go? - Not good. - You can't just let things go this way. Mika, how were things in middle school? You don't need to know. Pretty bad. Like I said. Oh, you came! Come in, don't be shy. Come on in. Come. Did you come to watch? Would you like to practice? Did you bring a change of clothes? That's fine. You'll need some dance shoes, let's see... - I have two pairs. - Really? I bought a new pair yesterday. Sorry if they're used, but they're still good. - Thanks, Rin. - No problem. Let's go change. This is the changing room, put your bag also on the shelf. Her name is Ichika, a probationary pupil. Have you ever practiced dancing before? All right. Watch and copy them. Use this bar, okay? Alright, let's start with révérence Okay, good day to everyone. - Good day. - Good day. Both hands on the bar, warm up tendu Open your shoulders. Follow the heel. Work more with your foot. A bit more, yes. En dedans, the hip's joint. Keep your pelvis straight. Straight.

En avant, using your pinkie finger. Good, just that way. Stop laughing, concentrate! Brilliant. Mind your own buisness. Ichika, your posture is a bit off. Where did you study? Okay, balancée. Let's do it one last time. Huh? Still awake? What's going on here? You cleaned everything? You did what I told you... What's the matter? I just don't understand you. Rise. Bow. - Good day. - Good day. Don't wander off. Go straight home. I'll see you later. Hey! I don't believe it. For real. I'm home. Oh, welcome back. How was your day? It was fun, I guess. I'm home. - Hiya, you hungry? - I'm alright. Oh, is she your friend? Yes, Ichika. She goes to dance school, too. How was school? It was fun. There was an english test, I did my best. Good. Pleased to meet you. Let's go. Age of puberty? That's me. And that's my mother. She studied dance in New York, must have spent a fortune. I didn't wear them, mom did. I don't understand you. Hey, what colour do you like? Are you listening to me? She's ignoring me. I wonder if this will look good on her? Maybe it's a bit too small? Here. It's old, take it. I don't have any money. Don't worry about it. Frankly speaking, we're rich. My mother is always at the beautician, and dad is loaded along with a lover. According to father, his money will never run out, like thermal waters. I can't even pay for the lessons. Ah, I understand. Family problems, right? Okay, okay. Press here, please. Okay, done. Have you had any health problems lately? Good. We'll see each other next week. You promised your mother you'd stop playing around, right? Are you paying attention to me? You need to keep your word. I don't know what to do with you. Are you listening? Not talking? Okay, I'm leaving. Mommy! Let's go home. Good, until next time! Return soon! Okay, next! Bye! - This is for you. - Me? - How nice! Thank you. - And this. You sure? Thanks. - 40 seconds, alright? - Oh, yes. Listen, guys. I brought my friend, Miwa. - Get in line. - Swimming suits? Obviously not! Okay, 40 seconds, ready go! Distasteful. Wonderful job, girls, well, it continues, right? Your stamp? Use this for me and her. Let's see, Ayumi worked 5 hours, so that's 25,000 yen. Here it is. And for you, Miwa, here's 10.000. Is that fine? Well done, girls. Oh, Miwa. Yes? You can do private sessions if you're interested. Photo sessions face to face. Don't do it. Let's go. Excuse me. Move. Don't look at me. Crying will help me. Do I scare you? Do I disgust you? I will never know the answer. I feel sick. It's not right. Why me? Why me? I just don't understand. I don't understand. Because I have this body? Back leg, twice. Now, the other side. Now pirouette, en dehors. Then, the same leg. Twice, then switch. - Understand? - Yes. Now, with the music. First group, get ready. Follow by turning you heel. More épaule Elongate your neck. Your neck! Don't enter again with your back leg. Elongate your arms. How many times must I say it? The arms! Continue. Ichika, very good. You're getting better. More freely! Your center is too low. Keep your body straight! Higher up, stretch your arms. Lighter! Second group. Chassé, you're too stiff! Ichika, the neck! Jump higher! The knees! Ichika, knees straight. You can jump higher! You're losing balance. Ichika, your neck! Continue, continue to jump, don't give up! Higher! Ichika, continue by yourself. Don't stop! Are you okay? My foot is still not healed. Mika is now concentrating soley on Ichika. The back and the neck. I said the neck! You're almost there, the back! We'll stop here for today. Good job. You made it. See you. Take care. Hey, Ichika. You should try "private". "Private"? You need more money for the courses, you should do it. It's time for the private session. One hour each, starting now. Hello. Ready? You're cute. Give me a smile. Hands on your hips. Hands on hips. Yes, like that. I'll buy you something. What would you like? Would you wear lingerie? Why not? I'll give you a heavy tip. What about... a swimming suit? Please? Look, I have it here with me. Try it on. When did you start working here? A while ago. A while ago... How did you find this job? - Social media. - Social media, got it. How many times did you do this? What's the matter? - Are you a relative of Ichika? - Yes, I am. What's wrong? Don't be quiet and say it to me. Uhm, it's my fault. Ichika needs money for dance lessons. Dance lessons? Explain yourself. Hey, calm yourself and sit down. I need to ask you a few questions. - So, you're related to Ichika? - Yes. May I ask you some questions, then? - Did you know about this? - Obviously not. Thanks for coming by. I'm sorry this happened while under my supervision. Please accept my sincere apologies. Well, Rin was there because her friend brought it. Otherwise, she wouldn't have gone Furthermore, Rin receives a lot of pocket money from us. So, she has no need to work. She said she wanted to help one of her friends who was in need of money. I bet they asked her to join her "friend". - Mom, you misunderstand. - You, be quiet. My girl Rin is too innocent. She's talented, too. In the future, she will be studying dance abroad, so you'll be teaching her until then. Let's leave now. I'm sorry. Come on, quick! I'm very sorry. What's wrong with them? It's unbelievable. I'm so sorry for what happened. I thought you knew about the lessons. I didn't know she studied classic dance. Could you... allow Ichika to continue her dance lessons, please? She's only here temporarily, then she'll go back home. And the lessons will cost a fortune. I can't deny that. However, I think Ichika has 'extraordinary' talent. I'd like to teach her how it's done. Ballet is for rich people like her friend, not Ichika. - That's enough. - Sorry? - I said that's enough! - Hey, where are you going? I've had enough. Hey, wait a minute. Listen. Stop ignoring me! Say you'll never work again in a place like that! - Leave me alone. - Rethink it! I know you're in a tough situation, but you've got to look after yourself. Leave me alone! What's the matter with you? Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong? What are you doing? Stop, don't do that. - What is it? - Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! I won't. People like us... they have to learn how to survive by themselves. You need to be stronger. What's your name, cutie? She's adorable! Here, 100% fresh orange juice. Give it a taste. She's so cute! - My, what long legs! - Hands down! - You have dirty hands. - Bad mannered. Where did you find her, Nagisa? I'm sorry, I just didn't want to leave her by herself. No problem, whenever you want. Although you told me that it was all resolved, wasn't it? I'm worried about Mizuki. Just this once. Give me a minute. Would you do me a favour, Nagisa? Could I have a word? What is it? - I need money. - Money? - Certainly. - Sorry, I'll give it back to you. I don't mean to intrude, but isn't he the "Harbinger of Trouble"? I want to help him. - This is pathetic! - Shut up. They just don't know how to dance. - Go dancing. - I don't know if I could. Okay, well then I'll go. Quit it! Calm down! - No shouting! - You've been drinking too much. What's wrong with drinking in a club, huh? Not during the performance, please. Don't touch me! Hey, you! You either watch the show, or you can leave! What the fuck... I don't take orders from a fagot! Now, you've gone too far! Get outta here! I want you to leave! Get out! Out! Ichika, bye bye. - You were fantastic out there. - Just wonderful. - See you later, Nagisa. - Bye. It's a present for you. Let's go home. - Was that a choreography for the finals? - Yes. You've changed, Ichika. What do you mean? You've became more talkative. I wouldn't say so. But I do. And... you seem happier. I wouldn't say so. But I do. And you're also prettier. I wouldn't say so. But I do. Also, you're dancing much better now. I wouldn't say so. But I do. Hey. May I kiss you? Yes. Would you like to see our girls, Sir? Beautiful girls, great prices. Come on in. Why don't you go straight? You never listen. Then, give up on me, Madame. Think about it, okay? If you let your life go down the drain, you're finished. But I'm unable to earn enough here. How rude. And our bodies cost more than those of normal women! Mizuki! What's going on with her? She's doomed, unfortunately. Mizuki, wait. Let's talk. - Let's talk. - It's useless. Come on, let's talk about it. So that we can cry together? - I can lend you money. - Stop it! If I let you do that, you'll be broke. And what about him? Is he exploiting you? Mizuki. We have confirmation that there is a a tear in the Plantar fasciitis. Is there anything we can do? I'm afraid she will no longer be able to dance like before. But dancing is this child's life! My deepest regrets... I can't believe this. I understand. Where did you hear about us? On the Internet. What prompted you to apply for this position? Well, it looked like a place where I could find a stable job. I really like your earing. I was looking for something just like those. Thank you for the compliment. Hey, you're into trends, right? I'm referring to LGBT. It must be tough. I've started to learn some things about you. Boss... What? Did I say something wrong? I'm sorry, he's elderly. Elderly? You're being too harsh. Are you saying you're not? What did you "learn", anyway? - But I just wanted to show some interest... - No "but". I apologise. - See you, Mika. - Take care. Pardon me. Oh, Nagisa, why are you here? - Come inside. - I'm fine here. Uhm... it's about the payment for the tuition. - It will take me a bit longer. - That's okay, don't worry about it. I could give you an exemption, if you want. Thanks, but I'd like to pay what is due. I don't know what to tell you, but there will be additional expenses. Registration for the competition, and the purchase of the necessary costumes. I understand. They must be expensive. I know... it must be a difficult time for you, as her mother. But let's face it together. - Is something the matter? - You just called me "mother". No, did I? I'm so sorry! Did I really say that? Please, forgive me. See you. Sorry again, goodbye. I'm starving. Dinner is ready. Could you put that comic away? Enjoy your meal. Where are your good manners? Enjoy your meal. Do you like it? - It's good. What is it? - Sautée with ginger and honey. - Fried pork with honey, then. - No, it's sautée with ginger and honey. Have some vegetables, too. - I don't like them. - You need to eat your greens. That's good. Some carrots also. Afterwards, give me your laundry. Alright. I should do this in the club. Teach me. - Impossible. - Why not? Let me see, come on. You're not able to. Come on, let me see. Okay, plié - Pudding? - No, plié. Plié. Eyes on my feet. And do this with your arms. Like this? - No, get off and... - It's the same. - This? - This way. - Like this? - No! - Your fingers. - I'm doing it. - Like this? - Yes. Look, like this. - You didn't do that before. - No. - Why did you change? - Shut up. - What is this? - Shut up. Swan Lake, right? You two are fantastic dancers. Two princesses, I'd say. However, at dawn, you will turn back into swans. How sad. - Teach me again. - It's enough. - What Madame said is true. - What was it? That life is going to be slipped away. You sure? I don't want Ichika's talent to just be wasted. Start, please. Assemblé. Good, Yuka, remember that. Next. - Jump higher. - Excuse me! Arms are too slow. Okay, drink some water. What's wrong, Ichika? Put your head in the game. The finals are close, you know? Think of Nagisa and do your best. Are you worried about something? Is Rin not coming back? No... Unfortunately not. Okay, next, medium jump. - Yes. - Start in 5ª. Here you are. Pleased to meet you. I heard you're new here. - Yes. - Wow, lucky. You still have it down there, right? Right? Oh yeah, you're turning me on. I like it. Hey, what's wrong? - Sorry! - What? What happened? Hey, come here! - Leave me alone! - I didn't do anything wrong! You have no right to look down on me. Sorry! I'm sorry! - Get back inside! - Forgive me! Mizuki? What have you got there, huh? Who do you think you are?! Why does everyone think they can mistreat us? - Why?! - It's okay, Mizuki. Everything's okay, Mizuki. - I don't get it! - Everything's fine. Do you have any wounds? Let's have a talk at the station. Officer, you don't understand. It's my fault, not Mizuki's. I'm afraid we must interrogate the aggressor. - It's clean. - That is fine. So, your name is Kentaro Nogami, right? Here is your bag and your ID card, thank you. National Health Card Mr. Kentaro Nogami That's not me. Pardon? I'm Miss Mizuki Nogami, I have no clue who Kentaro is. Oh, I understand... Then, would you mind coming with us to the station, please? Hey, listen… Who's Kentaro? I don't know him. - That's okay. - Listen to me. - Wait here a moment. Go back. - Mizuki! Ichika, wake up. You need to get ready for school. You got up early. Good morning. Have a bit of breakfast. I have to leave in a while. What happened? This? I got a job. The hell are you saying? So, you can focus on ballet. What's up with you? I'm doing this for you. - I never asked you to. - How can you say that? - I never asked you to do that. - Ichika. Come here. Come here! Ichika. Come here. There, there. There, there. - Move! - Sorry. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm sorry. It takes strength, you know. Where are your balls, huh? Don't suprise me like that. Oh, write your name. On the helmet. - Okay. - They'll lecture you. TAKEDA KENJI Are you going to perform Swan Lake for the finals? The judge will be very severe seeing as it's such a famous ballet. But I want to at least try. Ichika. It's time to go back home. Your mother... has changed. Hi, Nagisa. Good morning. Let's sign her up. This way. I'll bring the CD too. Hello, registration please, number 68, Ichika Sakurada. I'm nervous. - Just dance like you always do. - I'm sure I'll mess up. - Mother is here for you. - I know. Harlequinade, right? You bring it with you. Thanks. Ichika. Ichika, girls, let's go. Follow me. N°43, Sara Araki, variation for soloist by Paquita. Are these vacant? Let's sit here.

Ís that one Rin? - She grew quite a lot. - She's still a child. Come here, now! Greet Mr. Nakayama. Come on. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Do you remember us, Rin? - Well, it's been a while. - Yeah, she was young. - I think she was six or seven? - Has it really been that long? - Remember that Clara was really small. - Oh yes, sweet Clara. - You grew up too. - You were just a tiny pup. She's really adorable. She is very well trained and quiet. - You'll get no problems from her. - Good girl, Clara. Thanks to her owner, am I right? Of course. N°68, Ichika Sakurada. Colombine, variation from Harlequinade. Colombine, "Harlequinade" - Go, Ichika! - Silence! Your daughter is brilliant! She studied a little here in the city. Is that so? She must be really talented. - What's wrong with her? - Is this ballet? - Shouldn't you stop her? - That's okay. Wow, doesn't she look like a pro? - Incredible. - Such talent. I don't know much, but they tell me she's good. Ladies and Gentlemen, here come the bride and groom! Congratulations! Wonderful! Well done, Ichika. By the way, did you see that girl, number 68? - That girl with the long legs over there? - She's so gifted. She's the favourite, right? I'm not surprised.

Hey, is that her real mother? Nagisa? - I went to town with him. - We didn't. - But, yes, we saw that dress. - No! The dress was very pretty though. I'm broke, but I need it when I see my boyfriend. Hey, Ichika, are you listening? What should I do? Ichika! The fuck is it? - Hey, asshole! - Get out. What are you looking at? Saori wants you to come to Grandma's. Immediately! Hurry up and enter. He came here to bring you back. Ichika, we're going home. Are you crazy or what? She's my daughter! You can't stay here, you should dance. - Damn thieving fagot! - Stop that! Please, get treated by a doctor. Please, Kenji! Listen, mom, I'm not sick, so I can't be cured. Let's go home, Ichika. Poor girl... You can't even wear your costume! Ichika. Don't worry. I'll take care of you, alright? I'm giving it my all to take care of her! You don't know how hard it is to raise a daughter all alone! Look who's talking, you foolish woman! You let her hurt herself! It's all your fault, you idiot! Leave her. - Let me go! - Fuck you! You hideous monster. Get lost! Ichika. You know, I'm now a woman, so I can be your mother. I can be your mother. Ichika.

You're late today. Will you change my diaper? Ichika? I'm sorry. I thought you were the nurse. Oh dear... how embarassing. Don't look at me. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It was wonderful to finally become a woman. But I haven't taken care of myself. Dinner is ready. It's delicious. Pork fried with honey. It's my recipe. Now it's mine.

"Why wasn't I a girl?" Come on, let's leave. You need to go to the hospital. How beautiful. Stop it. What's wrong? There's a swan. Swans don't swim in the ocean. Don't be silly.
