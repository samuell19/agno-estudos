Don't do that! It all began on the evening of Shrove Tuesday. "Colette House Beauty Care Massages for Men" Good evening, the girls are all over there and they are waiting. They are eager to see you. You, go away. The mistress doesn't want to see you here anymore. Please, gentlemen, go in. Go in. Ah, how is Francine's future? Very fascinating, there is a long journey. - Jeez, that's nice. -Yes. A mysterious journey. Look here, what does this queen mean? Girls, come on, come on quick my beauties come with me to the yellow living room. Francine, Kiki, Alice, come with me. What is it? Those men. Fine. Kiki, Francine, Alice, go there. Florence bring us some more champagne. - Yes, right away. -Francine, wait. Antoine, are you still here? Mr. Antoine, what more do you want? I told you to never set foot in here again. Here Madame Colette, I pay more, much more than the others. All right. Come Francine, let's go. But just this once. Ah, Francine hurry up, they have asked for your special services. You are so beautiful, Francine. If you only knew how I love jewelry, I wish I had so many wonderful ones. You are wonderful Francine. They are for you. All for you. But you must be mine, only mine. Florence, why doesn't madame Colette want that man hanging out at this house? Who are you talking about? About that guy who's up there with Francine. Mr. Randall, have you been to Vietnam? Yes. And so you can understand how here, like in Vietnam, there is no place for love. That man is seriously in love with Francine. Mine, mine, mine. You will no longer go with the others. Yes, yes. You cannot understand these things, I can never forget that night, the Vietcong penetrated our village, it was carnage. I can still hear the screams of the wounded who asked for mercy. Well not completely because people want to read only about the enemy's. Why not finding a more cheerful topic? Madame Colette those two men, the masked ones I mean, who are they? Do you know them? I cannot tell you. We also have professional secrecy. Oh, I see! Well, we should urge Francine, I have little time left. Francine, hurry up, they're waiting for you. Come on, hurry up! All right, I'll be right there. No, Francine, don't go, please. Come on, be good, I'll be back. Bye. No! I told you not to do that! Come on take it easy, next time we will decide everything eh! No! You can't do this to me, you don't have to, bitch! Then go away, you disgust me! Any customer is better than you! Bitch! You don't have to do this to me! Bitch, you're nothing but a whore! Bitch! You disgust me! Bitch! - Madame Colette. -Yes? I would like to know more about that strange guy who is upstairs with Francine. Mr. Antoine. Hey, you! Madame Colette. What happened? Francine is dead. Quick, get out! Get out! You must leave now! Soon! Hurry up! Here, Inspector, we found her as you see her just now. Mistral, take her to the morgue. Right away, Inspector. Antoine Gottvalles. Richard Randall. That's me. Yes I know. Mistral! Here I am. Here. Check this address for me. Fine. Anyone else? Well, there were also two customers. And where did they go? You know, in the commotion I didn't see them leave. But you will have saw who they were with. Of course, they stayed together with Kiki and Alice, but they won't be able to tell you who they were, it's the kind of people who come here in the evening after hours for sauna and massage. Massages? Oh yes, massages, I understand. Mr. Randall, when do you-- What more do you want to know, Inspector? Antoine Gottvalles killed that poor girl, he had threatened her several times. It's all my fault, I should not have let that wretch in. Mistral! I did that check. Have your order sent out immediately for the search for that Antoine Gottvalles, about six feet tall, brown hair and blue eyes. Right away. It is love. True love finally. Don't disappoint me Pepin, please. Who is it? Don't care about it. Wait. Who is it? Marianne, it's me. It's me, Antoine. Please open up. Open up, Marianne. Open up. Give him hell. Open up. Go away, Antoine. Open or I'll break the door down. I told you to go away, Antoine. Open or I'll break in everything. Everything, do you understand? Open up, Marianne. I'm in a big mess, I do not know who to go to Marianne. Please get out of here, Antoine. I don't want to know about you anymore. Don't come here anymore. Do you understand? Go away. Haven't you heard, you filthy bastard? Marianne told you to get out of here, out of the way and row away. You, come here. Damn you, open up. Want to smoke, boy? You're all sons of bitches. Dear Georges, my opinion is that that Gottvalles is paranoid, unable to act rationally. There are many guys like him. Have you read the autopsy result? Sure. The poor girl's brain was crushed by the force of the blow of the lamp. Daddy, please, why not discuss another topic? - Let's go over there and have a coffee. -Sure. Please, you first. I guess this time you won't have to put much effort into this process. Well, in confidence, I have never seen such obvious guilt since the first investigations, but I can't discuss the case, Theodore. Oh, sure, I understand you, sorry. Please have a seat. I imagine the press will have a field day with this case. Newspapers. They have too much liberty. Now Georges, that's not the way for Georges to talk. You always have my favourite kind. Expensive, though. Oh, Roger. Judge, this is my new assistant. Good evening professor. Roger Delluc. - A pleasure. -How do you do doctor? Welcome in, Roger. This is Judge Tessier. He will be the center of attention for a while. He will be presiding over the Gottvalles trial. I don't envy you. Professor I would like to take Eleonora to the Olympia tonight. Sorry, but tonight Eleonora must do some work. It is something of a certain urgency, I need her to copy some notes. We will have time to do it tomorrow. Don't you feel like you're working a little too hard? Those notes are too important to me. By the way Roger, tomorrow morning you will have to go to the courthouse. You will be by the Chancellor and give him the results of the psychiatric expertise of Antoine Gottvalles. All right. - Do you want some coffee Roger? -No, thank you. - It was a real pleasure to meet you. - My pleasure. Wait for me Roger, I'll walk you. I'm sorry we can't go out tonight, better if I didn't ask his permission. Don't say that Roger, I could not be disloyal to my father as I could not be with you. What are you doing? If my father could see us he would no longer let us see each other. Let's not be imprudent. But please. See you tomorrow, Roger. Bye. "Witness Room" I'd like to see the damn thing die. Poor Francine. And yet I still have doubts. I know Antoine very well, we were once married. Poor guy. Yes, he was violent, but not a killer. Instead there are no doubts, they will condemn him to death. Dr. Delluc, do you remember me? Oh but of course, you're Mr. Randall. Yes, we met at Professor Waldemar's. Exactly. You came to his home for an interview Here, I would like to ask you to grant me some of your precious time, because I am writing a novel about a certain environment and I absolutely need the scholar's opinion, the psychiatrist's opinion and I know you're good at this. And Professor Waldemar-- Come to rue Pigalle, doctor and you can enjoy Marianne's number, that is simply sensational. Moreover, Richard has a table reserved all for himself. And that's not all, Dr. Delluc, we took care of ourselves, you know? If the police for the moment shut us down, Mr. Randall has a private lounge. Antoine Gottvalles, you have been judged by this court. The charge is the murder of Francine Didier. No, I did not kill her. You are crazy! Silence! I loved her. The court has issued this judgment. Guilty. For this crime the death penalty is foreseen. Old fool! Silence! I am not a murderer! You are the guilty ones, it's only because of your false depositions that I am here. I curse you. Filthy whore. And you, intriguing dirtbag, will end up the same way. And you, who couldn't wait to get rid of me to throw yourself in the arms of that scrappy whoremonger. I curse you all! I will return from the grave and I will kill you all! Listen to this title. "Antoine Gottvalles promises to return from the afterlife". And then again, "They will die a violent death all those responsible for his conviction." And you? Don't you worry? You are on the list. If I should worry about threats from convicts, I should have been dead long ago. TV, "After passing the first part of the day to visit the Great Wall and the tombs of the Ming emperors, President Nixon resumed late afternoon talks with Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai... Honey, now I have to say goodbye. Oh... Here, buy yourself something. Thank you. Now I really have to go, you know? - When will I see you again? - Whenever you want. Listen, can we meet tomorrow? Of course, call me. See you tomorrow. TV, "Chronicle from the inside: we have recently received news that the well-known Antoine Gottvalles convicted felon for the murder of Francine Didier escaped. We will give you wider details later on as soon as we come into possession of it. For the moment we are sending you the summary picture of this disconcerting figure. When he was 12 he was locked up in a reformatory from which he was able to escape--" Madame Colette? Listen to the description of the daughter, she is a small woman--. From the communications department. All right. About forty, yes of course, goodbye. Pass me the radio control, it's urgent. Stop! Thief! Stop him! Burglar! Stop him! Fontaine, Yes. Here is the report. I'll take care of it right away. - Is that all right? -Yes, of course. I'll bring it to Gerard. Our boy has changed means of transport, he stole a motorcycle and made the trail go cold. This gives him an advantage in the traffic of Paris, we will search for him by radio. Do it now. Documents. Stop! He's over there! To the car. Stop! He went that way! We have located him in the Bois de Boulogne The opportunity I was waiting for, let's go. Why are you still drinking? He won't come anymore. And I'm alone too. And I lost my hope Come with me, I am thirsty like you. I'm as thirsty for love as you are, come with me. I'm as thirsty for love as you are, come with me. Hello Roger. - Good evening. -Prepare the usual. Right away. Friend, Give me a drink. He won't come anymore. I'm going to forget him too. You are my only hope. Usually Randall is here by now. It is very late, I'm sorry but I have to leave. See you. Well if you need anything call me. Thank you very much. See you. Why are you still drinking? He won't come anymore. Enough. Stay still. You stay still. I love you, you know? And leave me. Leave me. I've lost the hope. Come with me, am I thirsty as you are? Stop it. I am as thirsty for love as you are. Come with me. Enough. Come with me. Yes, I'm coming with you. Come with me. Enough. My beauty where are you going? Come here. Don't be stupid. - Come on. -No. I guess that's enough for you, huh? Friend. Gaston, kick him out. Go out. And don't let me see you here again. How is it that you show so much interest in Tina? One moment Marianne. I would like to talk to you. Did you hear about Antoine? I have never been convinced of his guilt. Nor of all your depositions. And well what do you want from me? Antoine was your husband. We loved each other very much once. Of course, of course. But that night you refused to help him, right? What drove you to act like this? Fear? Good evening inspector. Good evening Pepin. You have to prepare for the next number. I cannot help you, Inspector. Good evening. You put hands on that guy. However, try not to abuse it. Hello? Miss, pass me to Judge Tessier, please. Yes, Théodore Waldemar. Thank you, I'll hold on. Hello, old boy. How are you? Well, I can't complain. I'm really happy. Can I help you? Listen to me, Georges. About those experiments of mine, I would like to ask you a big favor, but you mustn't think it's a strange thing. No, it's okay. Tell me about it. What can I do for you? I would like to have the head of Antoine Gottvalles for some research. I understand that you may have difficulties, but you have to try to get it for me. It is important to me. Yes, I understand. All right, Théodore. We will see what I can do. You really are a friend, old boy. Don't expect miracles, though. Truly a magnificent specimen. It must be said that my friend Tessier has performed a real miracle. - Roger. -Yes. - I would like to take out the eyes now. Take care of it. -All right. Professor, the eyes have moved. Don't be ridiculous. No muscle can move 24 hours after death. It was not a muscle, it's the iris that moved. I swear to you. Look, Roger. What is it? Tell him that I will be with him shortly, thank you. In this last period, you've been overworked, Roger. Take a vacation, you've earned it. A little rest will be good for you. Well-- A few days in the mountains will put you back on your feet. I invited you here to show you what you were kind enough to get for me. I find everything quite horrific. Well. You must remember you have been the one who condemned him to the guillotine. But this happened in court and I was doing my duty as judge. You see Théodore, that man was guilty and for this I had to condemn him. Of course. In any case, I did the craniotomy and I assure you that it was a very interesting study. The head of Gottvalles. His eyes, there was something that I cannot explain to you. Do you understand Eleonora? No, nobody believes it, nobody, not even your father. But why do you torment yourself? Because I am sure of it. Those eyes moved in the light. Do not think about it. They are the eyes of a dead man, Roger. Francine who had regained her appearance detached and professional looked with keen interest at the stolen jewelry. I was struck by that change and full of hate and resentment exploded by hitting her repeatedly. I beat her with anger, trying to destroy with my own hands the signs of mercenary love. Francine instead, like the image of a Madonna, seemed to smile at me in her hopeless pain, while she was making muffled cries. I was desperate! Full of helpless fury I crushed her face with the alabaster lamp. Fontaine speaking. - I'm Colette, Inspector. -Tell me. I would like to know something about my home. Sorry madame, -but at least for now there is nothing we can do about it. - And when will I be able to have precise news? I don't know, I will call you after I speak with Judge Tessier. But several days have now passed. And then, Colette? But everything has been ascertained, hasn't it? Look, the file is in the hands of the judge, he's the one who will decide. Listen to me, I need to talk to you urgently. Can you come by my place? - Sure, I'll come. -Thank you. Goodbye. It was madame Colette. What did she want at this hour? She was very nervous, that woman must surely know something. She wants to talk to me. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, Alice? Not going to sleep? I cannot. Do you feel sick? I am afraid. Look, don't get smart. You used to hang out at the house of madame Colette and you were there the night of the murder, do not try to deny it. I didn't go there to kill people, but to have fun. Get him out of here, his sight annoys me. Come on, let's go. Fontaine. Tell me boss, what is it? Look, the minister is pressuring. When I know something about it, I will call you immediately. - I recommend it. -All right. Okay, boss. Make way. Hello, Randall. You will find what I am about to tell you strange, but I asked you to come here with the hope that you can help me to shed some light on the murder of Madame Colette. Do you feel that the condemnation of Gottvalles was a bit hasty,don't you? I would like you to go back, with your sharp mind as a writer, to the time passed by Madame Colette, remembering even the smallest detail. Madame Colette knew something, had a secret. I think she had decided to talk, but she didn't make it in time, she was killed first. If you are interested in my opinion, I believe that the motive of the crime was money. It's a brutal way to steal, isn't it? What do you know about this money? They said she had a large sum hidden somewhere. You know, Madame Colette, was a somewhat eccentric woman, she had no trust in the banks. Apart from your personal curiosity, who else could be interested in this matter? There was someone else, one of the girls. Well, yes, of course, Alice. She seemed very interested, but now she has left the house and nobody knows where she's gone. Well, yes, that's why she disappeared. I have the impression that she was also aware of Madame Colette's secret. Polinon, let loose all the informants we have. They have to find her now. All right. Randall, I have never been completely convinced that a writer, for work reasons, should live among whores. What other reason was there? I don't care what you think. Do you want to arrest me for this? Get out. There is no point in hiding your king, old boy. Don't judge too quickly, Georges. You know what? After the death of Madame Colette, no more joking about Gottevalles' curse. These are superstitions. Anyway, I'm glad not to be on his list. Here. Listen, Eleonora, why don't we go somewhere else? I would like to be alone with you so we can talk. We can't always see each other here. Roger, be patient. You know very well my father's opinion. Of course. How are the experiments on the head of Gottvalles? Fine. I discovered something very interesting. In his brain, there are traces of abnormal tissues, which in fact would contribute to his abnormality. I have studied these elements in depth and I have come to the conclusion he was a schizophrenic. Maybe. But, you see, after the murder of Madame Colette, I had the doubt of having condemned the wrong person. I want to reconsult all files of the process. I would not wish to have made a serious mistake. It's your move. Checkmate. Professor, if you allow-- Daddy, what is it? What's happening to him, Daddy? Nothing, Eleonora, nothing. Drink this. I had a dizziness. I'll have Roger drive you home. - Well, yes, of course. Yes. I will accompany you, Judge. Come with me. Thank you, Roger. My duty. You really live in a very nice villa, Mr. Judge. Congratulations. - I'm enjoying it very little, Roger. - Sure, with your work. - Are you sure you feel well, Judge? - Yes, thank you, Roger. And take care. Well, of course. Thank you. Good night, Roger. - Good night. -Good night. I wanted to say good night, Daddy. Good night, sweetheart. Bye. One moment Eleonora. Yes? I wanted to ask you something. Please, go ahead. I didn't like Roger's look at all while he was alone with you in the other room. You know my opinion. I don't want that boy to bother you. I know your opinion about it and you know that I have always required to respect your wishes, but- But what? Well, it is not my fault if he is full of care, of attention. I told him to leave you alone, but evidently he does not want to understand. I will have to talk to him again. Please Daddy, do not bother about it. All this is very embarrassing for me. I promise you-- - Hello? -Hello. - I'm Tessier. -Ah Georges. How do you feel? Did you get over that sickness? I feel much better now, thank you. Very good. You will see that a good glass of cognac and a good night's sleep will get you back on your feet. That's what you need. Well, I will follow your advice. And tomorrow you'll be fine. Thanks I will read again the file of the process of Gottvalles. I will let you know if I find something. Bye, see you tomorrow. Alright darling. I won't cause you any embarrassment. Thanks, father. I will try not to embarrass you anymore, is that okay? Good night darling. Thanks dad, good night. "Trial" Tina, I want to talk to you. Yes? What about? I saw you were talking to Pepin in secret. True, but not in the way that you are thinking my dear. In what way then? - I have to go now. -I'd like an answer now. Why? Pepin sometimes disappears for hours, like now. I'm sure you know where he goes, and who he goes with. I am scared, Pepin. I do not want to end up like madame Colette. Don't be silly. You must have faith in me. - Yes. -We'll make a lot of money out of it. And Marianne? This is my business. Maybe it was better to give up everything and call the police. What are you saying? Pack your suitcase and try to be cautious. Bye. All right love. Bye. Over here. And the old man? He is asleep. Max, my love. Doris? Is that you Doris? Eleonora. Are you not feeling well? I had a bad nightmare, but it's over now. It was a horrible nightmare, Dad. It was as if they hurt a loved one, but I couldn't figure out who it was. Excuse me. Hello? Professor Waldemar? Yes, go ahead. I am Doris, Judge Tessier was murdered. This is not possible. I found him in his room, he had his throat slit. Oh my God. I beg you Professor, come at once, please. Yes, don't worry. What happened? What happened Daddy? It was Doris, poor Georges. He was murdered. He was murdered tonight. I wonder why Tessier died. The poor guy was on Gottvalles' list. Well and according to the list now it would be the turn of Pepin and Marianne. But you, Randall, are not on the list, are you? But this would happen in case it really existed the possibility that someone could take revenge postmortem. It's weird but a thin wire seems to bind this staggering series of deaths, does this not seem absurd to you? In any case there must be a cause plausible in all these crimes. It really is an interesting case, unprecedented as far as I know. That is why I am writing it, I was fascinated. As far as I am concerned, gentlemen, the killer is cunning, but will not escape justice. Excuse my embarrassing question, Inspector, if I am well informed you have arrested Doris, Tessier's maid, and her young lover. Is there evidence against them? I arrested the girl for complicity, but she is too thin to have made those blows. The man instead-Yes, Max, the lover of that girl, there is no doubt. You did really well, Inspector, but now excuse me, I have to go. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye, Professor. Well I bid goodbye to you too, Inspector. You don't need me, do you? No. Goodbye. Ah one moment, Randall. Also this time it went wrong, seemed to me scratches. You can go. Goodbye. See you soon. Mr. Randall. It will be fine that you do not leave Paris, at least for the moment. I will need some more clarification on this case. Just a few questions. Don't worry, I won't bother you too much. Okay. Listen Martin, you were the only outsider that was in the villa of the judge at that time of the night. You tell me that you went there to have a good time with that little friend of yours, and Doris confirms your alibi, but man, I find it a little weak. What reason would I have to kill him? Cigarette? If you ever had one, be sure that I will find it. All right, that's enough. Sign the declaration. Felicier. Come. Let him go, he's free. Martin, don't disappear, maybe we will have to see each other again. Charles, this is clean. Why, Inspector? In addition to his alibi, Martin has another one, he is left-handed and the judge was killed with the right. Hello, Club Pigalle? I would like to speak with your director, Pepin. - He was here at the opening of the club but now-- -Is he gone? Yes, sir. Ah, I understand, thank you. Roger, what are you kidding me? You scared me. Stay still, I allowed to meet each other just to talk, just for that. What happened? You have changed a lot in recent times. You know my father's opinion about our relationship. But I really don't understand why he should object. I already told you, it will take some time, my father is an old-fashioned man, try to understand it, I love you, please just be patient a little longer. Then I was not mistaken. Go away Roger, go away, go far away from here, don't ever show your face again, you understand? Go away, Roger. Find anything in Randall's manuscript? Yes, very interesting. Do you remember how many girls were at Colette's? Five in all. Kiki, Rosie, Marlčne, Francine, the one we found killed in the house of Pepin, Alice. Only five. Why, Inspector? I count six. Randall has written about another, at page 137. He writes about Eleonora. I think we better have another talk with Randall. Randall was here earlier but he didn't stay. He picked up Tina and left It seems the death of Pepin hasn't hurt the business That's life. Marianne, is she here? Haven't seen here tonight. Hey bartender, whisky. Gotta go to work. I would like to speak with you, doctor. I don't feel like talking to anyone. Well you can decide to talk here or in my office. Take your choice. Well inspector, I propose it here. Have you ever been a client of madame Colette? Me? Are you joking? You are the only person that I know to be in love with Eleonora. What are you talking about? Listen. There is Randall who in the manuscript of his novel speaks of a certain Eleonora. There are many Eleonora's in this world. All right, but after I have spoken with Randall I think I will know a new one. Hey, you like to dance huh? It is my passion. Who can it be? Marianne why are you here? Have a seat. Sorry to bother you but I knew that Tina was here and I wanted to talk to her. Hi Tina. Hello Marianne. I give you something strong, huh? I know you're angry because I accused you that you were flirting with Pepin and instead it was with Alice who he was cheating on me. I had lost my mind, you know? Police interrogations. I didn't know what to do anymore. Here you go, this will cheer you up. Thank you. Tina I know you had an appointment with Pepin, you had to meet after the closing of the club, just the night he was murdered. But our meeting was only for business, nothing else. It doesn't matter anymore, but if he was going to meet you I thought-- I met him. Alone? No, he was with Alice. I told you it was just for business, I had to talk to someone, but I don't want to discuss it anymore, and don't bother me anymore. Wait, I'll be right back, Tina, I do not understand the reason of all these questions. The truth is that I am scared, I was very fond of Pepin and I don't know why he was killed. Perhaps Antoine's curse. I can't believe it and I know you don't believe it either, but all those who have been killed had testified against him. Eh, sorry Marianne, Tina is very nervous and I wouldn't want her-- Cover the back way. The light. Max, Max, that girl's lover. There are no doubts. Not now. Good evening Doris, sorry to disturb you but it is really necessary to ask you a few questions. I need some information. One moment, I'll call you Martin. No, I want to talk to you. Excuse me, but I have to ask you a rather intimate question. Do you have another friend besides Martin? No, absolutely not. Martin and I must get married in a few months. So who is Max? Martin, that's his real name, Martin. Come on Doris, tell me everything. It will be better for the two of you. Look Inspector, when Martin and I are making love I call him Max. Max, that girl's lover. There are no doubts. Thank you, Doris. Are you still here, Daddy? Hurry up, go to bed, it's very late, you need to rest. Listen to me. Eleonora. Daddy. Daddy what is it? - Eleonora. -Dad. - Eleonora. -Dad. No. Daddy. Help. No. No, Daddy. Help. Cursed. Stop. That's why you didn't want to give me Eleonora. A case like yours should fit in sexual psychopathy, you are not only a sexual psychopath, Waldemar, you are congenitally a goddamn filthy pig. How could I not notice before you were jealous of your daughter? Yes, morbidly jealous, but now I discovered you. I will kill you with these very hands. Roger, please don't do this. No. Stop! He is mine now. This is the end for you Waldemar, the initial that Randall wrote with blood before dying looked like an M and instead I found out it was a W, to identify you, Waldemar, that with your sick mind possessed prostitutes named with your daughter's name. Do you know where I found this mask? In the house of Judge Tessier, who was your unsuspecting accomplice. I am sure that in this home I will find a similar mask. Francine was your first victim, do you remember Waldemar? What's wrong with you? Nothing. It's nothing, go away. Eleonora, what happened to you? Tell me honey. Leonora I want to help you. Go away. You disgust me, go away. No, Eleonora. You don't have to talk to me like that. I told you to leave. You disgust me. Who is this Eleonora? Is she a whore? Shut up. You have to shut up. Do you understand? Eleonora is a whore and you're a lousy old man. You slut shut up. - Suck. -Stop it. - Suck. -Stop it. After the first crime killing becomes easy. Antoine Gottvalles was sacrificed thanks to the friendship of Judge Tessier and madame Colette who laughed of the two of you and perhaps blackmailed you was the third victim, but you, Waldemar, that understood that game subtracted 400,000 francs from her, you were very clever. You managed to divert the investigation making us think of a theft. Then it was the turn of the judge, better not to share with anyone certain burdens. Alice had managed to discover Madame Colette's secret and revealed it to Pepin. Pepin in turn blackmailed you, didn't he? They had to die. Randall, Marianne, Tina, their end was marked. This is not true. It is not so. It was Antoine Gottvalles, it was him with his devilish eyes who ordered me to kill. The jury might believe that those eyes had an affect on your sick mind. That same suggestion that you tried to transfer into Roger. Stop him. He's headed out the back way Don't.
