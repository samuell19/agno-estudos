The sun came out every winter just before Christmas. Everything lay beneath a sparkling white blanket, and it was spellbinding. It was only this year that everything was different. A snowstorm had been raging for days and showed no sign of stopping. Hey, Pettersson. What would you like for Christmas? A longer arm. So I can scratch my back more easily. What about you, Findus? Firstly, I wish it stops snowing. Then we can finally get our Christmas tree. Pettersson, I think it's stopping. No, Findus. It doesn't look like it. It does! It's stopping now! We can head out and get a tree from the woods, and go shopping for everything we need. So, we need meatballs, donuts, aspic, red cabbage, ham, bread, and chocolate pudding. And we need a Christmas tree. Let's go, Pettersson. Leave that for after Christmas. Come! No, Findus! Good thing my winter feathers are fat. It's not just your feathers that are fat, dear. I don't know what you mean. Oh, well. It was a bit on the warm side in here anyway. Right, Findus? Yes, Pettersson. And besides, I always wanted to have... -a snowball fight in the kitchen! -No, Findus. -Let's get out! -So stressful! Hey, Findus! If I had known, I would have stayed in my coop. Why? It's fun! Findus! I got you! You just wait! Okay, enough! -Okay. -We have to sweep it out before it melts. Sweep it out? I have a better idea. Let's build a snowman! Good idea. Hooray! I love snow! Hey, Pettersson? Is it possible for Christmas to be canceled? No. Christmas won't be canceled. Now get to sleep. But if it's still snowing so heavily tomorrow, we can't go to the woods and get the Christmas tree we wanted. Or go to the shops. Then it will be Christmas, but we will be sad. We won't be sad, Findus. Christmas is the season with joyous ends! The season with joyous friends? Oh, yes! We will invite all our friends. Beda, Gustavsson, Happo... Not "of joyous friends," but "of joyous ends." Of joyous ends and friends! Yes, but our friends will celebrate the season of joy separately. Together. With their families. What about us? We will celebrate together. The night after tomorrow after dusk. Yes! All together! Me, you, the hens, the Mucklas, all together under our beautiful Christmas tree. And with a delicious Christmas dinner. And chocolate pudding. Will it be a magical Christmas, Pettersson? Yes, Findus. A very, very magical Christmas. The best Christmas ever? The best Christmas ever. Promise? Promise. The best Christmas ever. Pettersson, wake up. The sun is shining. Wake up, you lazy hens! We have to prepare for Christmas. Christmas? So we can make a wish! -Then I wish for a rooster. -Right. The last one didn't last long. What? Your stupid squawking. He ran away with some young hen. She was so stupid. Stupid, but quiet! Good morning. It's too small, Pettersson. It's not for your head, Findus. For what then? Here, I'll show you. There you are. Turn around. I've always wanted one of these. And this one is for your head. To keep you warm when we're out in the woods. Right. I'll put something warm on too. You have gone too far! Come on, get changed. Hurry. First things first, I have to shovel some snow. Yes. Me, too! I'll get the whisk. Whisk? But Findus, that's for whipping cream. As if! I have some other thing. Pettersson, the skis are a bit broken. I know, Findus. I know. Right. First, I'll put the hens back in the coop. Why? Leave them in the house. It has always been great fun! Sure! Pooping on my head once is enough. It's cold! Typical. Everyone is warm celebrating Christmas indoors, -while we're freezing! -Get in! If that's how it is, there will be no eggs for Christmas. -We're going on strike! -Yes! Strike, yes! How does that work? Just do the same as always, do nothing. Hello. Beda! What are you doing here? Hello. Oh, dear! -Darn! -Did you hurt yourself? Let me help. No need, Beda. I'm fine. It's slippery. You should scatter some fir branches. I was just in the woods, so I have some with me. -Great. I'll scatter them. -Beda, there is no need. Beda needs them. Never mind. I can always get more. No. It's very kind of you to offer. We're heading to the woods anyway to get our Christmas tree. Gingerbread? Yes. Right. A coffee to warm you up. You will not find coffee this good anywhere. Your coffee is truly infamous! Famous. Famous. And? Tasty, right? Well, I just wanted to make sure that you survived the snowstorm. You know what? I have visitors this Christmas. My whole family. My brother, his wife, their kids, and my grandkids. Let's go, Pettersson. We have to go to the woods. -Someone is getting impatient. -I should get going. Happy holidays! All right. I'll take half. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Beda. What is it, Happo? Our friend, the carp, is down there. I'll get him. Quiet, Happo! Quiet. You will scare away my carp. Hello, Gustavsson. Yes, Beda. Ice is slippery. You need a decent grip on your boots. Well, then... Did you catch your Christmas carp? I'm in no hurry, Beda. No hurry. I could be fishing a bit longer... Angling for fish, angel. -So today is the big cleanup? -Today, I... Wait. I think I have something. I think I have... Something. -Again. -I went to old Pettersson's to check up on him. -I feel sorry for him. -Why is that? Your kids are coming. My whole family is coming. Only Pettersson is alone for Christmas. That's not the worst way to spend it, Beda. Not the worst. Besides... He's always talking to his cat. Crazy, right, Happo? I don't know. I... Hold on! Quiet, Happo! Sit! Now I... You will have the pond cleared out by tonight. That's funny, Beda. Really funny. But we're not dependent on carp. Oh, no. We have tons of food. Ham, aspic, red cabbage, bread... Then bon app√©tit! Thanks. Merry Christmas then. You too, Beda. Merry Christmas. Unbelievable. Was... Happo, was that you? Happo, was that you? Happo, other dogs catch fish for their masters. And you... You just pinch my provisions. Happo, that really hurts. Pettersson! Something is there. -What? -Maybe the fox? The fox? I don't think he survived the snowstorm. Poor thing. Well, maybe he did. And he's nestled in his warm den. Decorating his Christmas tree. -Hi, Gustavsson! -Hi, Happo! Quiet or you'll scare off the carp! Hi, Pettersson. Are you looking for a Christmas tree? No. We found one already. We just have to chop it down. Findus already picked the best-looking Christmas tree. You let your cat pick your Christmas tree? You will always be hopeless! Hopeless! Happo, you're missing a trick. Look. Pettersson pulls our sleigh. It must make you hungry, right? Here, I've tucked away some food. Meatballs. It's not so sharp, Pettersson. -You want to chop down a tree with that? -It will work. I'll go with you to hack it down with my ax. Here, touch it. Careful. It has been sharpened thrice. So where is this feline fern of yours? Hold on a second. We will manage it alone. Alone? Really? Very well. I take it the cat will be chopping down the tree, too? Have fun with that! We sure will, Gustavsson. -Come on, Findus, let's go. -See you, Happo. Pettersson, Beda said that you will maybe... well, be alone at Christmas? Me? Alone? How so? I have Findus. Sure. Of course. Right. Merry Christmas then. -Merry Christmas, Gustavsson. -Yes! -Let's go. -Merry Christmas, Gustavsson, Happo. Come on, Pettersson. Faster! Very good, Pettersson. Just a bit further. Just a bit. Very good. Pettersson. The tree we picked is way back there. I know, Findus. But we also need some branches to scatter in front of the house. And these ones are perfect. But then we get the tree. Hey, Pettersson. Don't you ever let anyone help you? We're doing just fine by ourselves. The others are busy with their own Christmas preparations. I think Gustavsson wanted to invite us over for Christmas. Gustavsson? No. Everybody celebrates Christmas alone. I thought it was the festivity of friends. Of joyous ends. But if you celebrated with all your friends, there would be more joyous ends! No. Christmas is for the family. I would like to have a really big Christmas party! With many joyous ends and lots of friends. Cool! All right! -Findus! -Coming! Gosh! Findus! Oh, that's fast! Again Pettersson! Again! That was so cool! Crazy! Again! Pettersson, sledding! I can't stand on this foot anymore. Damn it! You shouldn't curse on Christmas Eve, Pettersson. Does it really hurt? I'll blow on it. That will fix it. Thanks, Findus. That is much better. But we still haven't even chopped down our tree yet, Pettersson. I know, Findus. That's impossible right now. We should have just taken Beda's branches, then we wouldn't have needed those ones, and none of this would have happened. Or we should have accepted Gustavsson's help. You always say we should help others. Helping is fine, but you shouldn't be a burden. But if no one wants to be helped, no one can help anyone. I have such bad luck. Oh, well. The pain will ease before the shop closes. Then we can buy supplies. And we can finally get our Christmas tree. We still have so much to do. Like mopping the kitchen floor. I'll do that! Don't run off. You better not, Findus. I remember how it looked after last time. What? It was clean! Clean, yes, but soaking wet. That bit of water? -Please, Pettersson! -No... You need to relax. I can mop the floor while you rest. Okay. Just this once. But promise me you will dry up properly afterward. Sure. Let's go! I need water! Add more soap or it won't be slippery. You just want to slide around, don't you? What do you mean? I just want everything to be clean. Okay then. Oh, no! Let's start, Pettersson! Watch out! Watch out! Findus! Done! No, my dear. This time, you have to dry the floor yourself. But Pettersson, I'm exhausted. Here, feel how my heart is beating. No, I won't. You have to dry up this time. I can hardly move my foot. But you could kneel down. Please. I'm so tired. I'm just a little cat. You can really play the pity card. Now, get to work. The floor cloth is under the sink. When you are done, we will bake gingerbread. All right. Just this once. It's always the poor little guys. I'm finished! Wake up! What? -What? -Come on. Gingerbread baking! Let's bake. Wait. I have an idea. Good idea, Findus. It's incredible how much the dough mix has shrunk since the day before yesterday. Yes, incredible. Did you have a nibble? I never nibble at the gingerbread dough. Well then, it must have been me. Yes. But that's not going to be enough for us. It is only very little. We will have to mix more. Exactly. All we have left are carrots. Gross. Then let's eat the gingerbread from the other day. I'm afraid Beda ate most of it. She always eats everything. We will just have to bake less gingerbread. Then let's go shopping. And go to get the tree. Right. Come on, Pettersson! We have to go! Quicker! I think I'm done for today. -What? -I won't get far with a stool for a leg. But it's Christmas tomorrow, Pettersson. Let's drop by Gerda's place in the morning, even if she's not open for business. She will sell us stuff. Then we will get the tree, decorate it, and after dark, we will have a nice Christmas party. A nice Christmas party? But you promised... it would be the best Christmas ever. It will be magical. The most magical ever? Yes. The best Christmas ever. Hey, Findus. When I was a kid, we always did something, so that Santa knew what we wanted. What was it? Listen. Right. What would you like? I would like the best Christmas ever. A festivity of friends and joyous ends. With lots of delicious treats, and chocolate pudding. Very well. And a gift? Yes, and a gift. "And a gift." What now? Follow me. Now we're going to build an igloo. Oh, yes. Being on strike is so boring. Can't I at least lay one egg? What is it? I think the fox is at the door. The fox? But I thought he didn't survive the snowstorm. Take a look if you're so sure. No, it's way too cold. What could he possibly want? His Christmas dinner, genius. He's getting nothing from me. Pettersson, I'm almost done, I just need one more block. Your wish list goes in the last block. And it goes right at the top. And if somebody has entered by dawn, we know Santa collected your wish list. Great! What else are you putting in? My very last meatball. In case Santa is hungry. That's a good idea. And now, we light the candles. Yes. Findus! Pettersson, it's so beautiful. Oh, no. Isn't he ever going to come? Maybe he's hiding behind a tree until you fall asleep. I can't wait that long. What will we do if your foot hasn't healed by dawn? Don't worry, Findus. Sleep tight. You too, old Pettersson. What a drag. It's so beautiful. Time for gifts! Is there any chocolate pudding? I have some for you. I have some, too. I have chocolate pudding for you, too. My dear Findus. Merry Christmas! This really is the best Christmas ever! -Did you hear that? -No. What? Did I hear bells jingling? Gift time, Findus. That's our Christmas tree? Pettersson! Merry Christmas! Is that supposed to be the best Christmas ever? The igloo caved in! Santa came and collected my wish list. It caved in! Santa was here! And the meatball? He ate that, too! Pettersson! This will be the best Christmas ever. You've got to see this. The igloo caved in! Pettersson! Pettersson! Pettersson! The igloo caved in! -Pettersson, where are you? -I'm here, Findus. Behind the bed. What are you doing down there? Oh, I'm just... Get up! We have to go shopping and get the tree. Right. Just a second, Findus. I have to sit down first. But you can walk again today, right? You said you would be able to walk again today. That's what I hoped for, but it hasn't improved. Come on, Findus. Cheer up a bit. Let's have breakfast first. Yummy porridge. It tastes weird. We're out of milk, so I used water. See? When I was a kid, we always ate it like this. You poor thing. I'm glad I wasn't a kid back then. We can't bake gingerbread, and we have nothing delicious to eat. And now we don't even have milk. We've got nothing at all! It was supposed to be the best Christmas ever. But it's going to be the worst ever. And Santa even scoffed the last meatball. Findus. I... I can't change that. Come here. Findus. -Findus! -Leave me alone. There is still time, my dear. There is still time. I have a lot... A lot... Merry Christmas, Gustavsson! Beda. What are you doing here? Stop shouting, or else you'll scare them off. I wanted to check on Pettersson. I feel bad about him being alone on Christmas. Merry Christmas to you and send my love to your family. You too. Merry... Got him! I got him! This one is a beast! Yes! This one is a... Oh, well. Then the Christmas music is covered. Very funny, Beda. Very funny. You won't make me fall for your tricks. I know for a fact that you're down there, my dear. Do you hear me? Moby Dick. Do you hear me and Happo? Good boy. And soon, when the sun goes down, it will be Christmas, but it will be the worst one ever. You deserve it! You wanted to celebrate without us anyway. We will celebrate with the fox. -Henni said so. -No! We are not celebrating with him, he's celebrating with us! Same thing. Believe me. It is not. The fox didn't survive the snowstorm. Poor guy. If we celebrate at all, we'll do it together. Well, I'm interested. But we won't be laying any eggs until then. What do you mean by that? We're on strike. Sadly. Great Christmas. We have nothing. Not even eggs. Pettersson! Pettersson! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Beda. What are you doing here? Nobody is visiting you for Christmas. Celebrating alone isn't so pleasant. So I thought you could come to our place. Me? To your place? What for? We will celebrate together. But I'm celebrating here with Findus. -You can bring Findus. -No, Beda. -We don't want to be any trouble. -You wouldn't be. The kids would love it if Findus came. No. No, we will stay here. That's too bad. Then I'll be on my way. Merry Christmas anyway, Pettersson. Merry Christmas, Beda. Beda was just here. Did you tell her to bring chocolate pudding? What? No. I didn't. Goodness. Please tell me she is at least bringing meatballs, donuts, aspic, ham, and bread. You... You didn't say anything, right? -No... -Gosh, Pettersson! Why don't you ever let anyone help you? Not even on Christmas. Findus! So much for the best Christmas ever! It's beautiful! I want our Christmas to be like this, too. With Pettersson and our friends. But with a bigger Christmas tree. That's it! If poor old Pettersson can't do it, then I'll have to. I'll ask Happo to help. Happo. I need your help. Quiet. Come here. Listen up. We need help. Gustavsson really has to pay Pettersson a visit. Happo, what is it? Why all the drama? It's just Pettersson's little cat. Come back, Happo! Come... Just you wait, sonny. Just you wait. Happo! Get... Happo! Heel! Great. Good boy. No, Happo. When training your dog, one must... Happo! Happo! Happo, heel! Happo! Where are you hiding? Happo! Happo! Your game is not amusing! Help! Help! Help! Happo, help me! Happo! Where are you hiding? There you are! Man! We're not fishing today. Darn! No grips on these boots. Happo, heel! Happo! Come here! Happo, help me, will you? Unbelievable. Such a rascal. Happo. Heel! Wait, Happo! Sit! Good boy. That's it. No! Stop! Heel! What are you doing here? He's lucky that he didn't fall into the freezing water, right? You're going to catch a cold. Or freeze to death. How will you get home? See what happens when you stray too far. What? Oh, right. All right. You two bring nothing but trouble. And at Christmas of all the days. Pettersson! Pettersson? Pettersson! Happo, sit! Good boy. A Christmas gift. What are you doing down there? Let me help. No, it's okay. I'll get up. I think it's best if I help you a bit. -It's all right. -No. -Leave it! -It's all right. I've got you. There we go! Up you go. Almost there... How about a coffee, Gustavsson? Yes, Pettersson. It's freezing outside. Yes, it's a harsh winter. A fairly harsh winter, damn it! Happo thinks so too. A harsh winter! Quiet, Happo! Sit! So what happened to your foot? -Nothing, it's just a slight sprain. -I see. Enough, really. Here, I brought you something, Pettersson. No. There's really no need. You should have it. We never exchange gifts. Take it. We're too old to start now. It belongs to you anyway, believe me. Findus? What have you been doing? I fished him out of the ice hole. He almost froze to death. Findus. What have you been up to? We have to warm you up! Right. We will get moving. Right, Happo? Here, right. Gustavsson... Yes, Gustavsson saved you. The little guy is back to his old self. -Right. See you. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, Gustavsson. Do you need anything? You must be stuck at home, right? Yes, thanks. We're fine. Or... We could use something. A bit of milk. Milk? Yes, but if it's too much trouble, we could do without it. A bit of milk is no trouble for me. Thanks. Come on, Happo. Calm down now, Findus. Your teeth are still chattering. Typical Pettersson. Come on, Happo. He has a drenched cat and no milk. What is it? What do we have here? Quiet, Happo. A fox trail. The old chicken thief did survive the storm after all. Too bad, I don't have my shotgun with me. Then I would give you a real pasting, old fox! Yes, that's what I'll do... Oh, Happo. What are you doing alone in the forest? Did you escape again? Beda! Merry Christmas. Is everything set for your dinner, roast in the oven? The kids took care of all that. And you? Everything is great. I'm on my way to get Pettersson some milk. Why milk? He's stuck at home with an injured foot. And all he needs is some milk? Yes. That's all. That's what he said at least. You would have frozen to death if Gustavsson hadn't found you. And who would I have celebrated with? It was me who lured him to the house, so he would see we have nothing to eat, and he could bring us something. I risked my life for that. And I even lost my skis in the ice hole. We have no gingerbread, no ham, no aspic, no meatballs, and no chocolate pudding. Nothing at all! Then you tell him we only need some milk. We can't expect him to supply us with a whole Christmas dinner! Sure, we can! He even asked if we needed anything else. -Legs down. -He even invited us over. We could have celebrated with him and his family. What? With Gustavsson? You said it yourself, Christmas is the festivity of friends! No, I said... Christmas is the festivity of joyous ends. Besides, Gustavsson is our neighbor. That's very different from a friend. Okay. Happo is my friend and neighbor. Besides, if you want to bring joy into somebody's life, then you have to embrace it, otherwise, no one wins. But we can also be joyful with just the two of us. It will be dark soon, and we won't even have a Christmas dinner. We don't even have a Christmas tree. All because you won't let anyone help you. Come on, Findus. Hey. Come here, my little cat. Oh, Pettersson. You know what, Findus? You're right. Next time someone offers to help me, I'll accept. But that won't bring us a Christmas tree. And no magical Christmas. And certainly not the best Christmas ever. Then we'll have to make it happen ourselves. The best Christmas ever? Sure. And we'll start with the tree. Is it possible to make a Christmas tree? Of course. Okay. But the hens can join in. If you insist. But only if they don't poop on me. And? What is this? A plank with holes? Wrong. It's a Christmas tree. That's not a Christmas tree. Do you want to bet? There it is. Nice. Very nice. And now? We will prepare our Christmas dinner. But we have nothing. We have carrots. Carrots? Yes, very, very special and yummy Christmas carrots. You like them, right, Findus? Sure. It's my favorite Christmas food. Carrot stew with fried eggs. So we have eggs again? Henni, do we have eggs again? Merry Christmas! It's like Easter and Christmas rolled into one! Thanks. Is the strike over? Finally. Findus, do you have any idea where the forks are? No. The Mucklas must have borrowed them. We will eat with spoons then. Yummy. We will eat this every Christmas now, Pettersson. As you like, Findus. It beats ham, aspic, red cabbage, meatballs, bread, gingerbread, donuts, -and chocolate pudding. -Oh, man! Chocolate pudding would have been nice. Come here, kiddo. We have each other. Yes, Pettersson, we have that. And being with you is always nice. -Even without chocolate pudding. -With you, too. Merry Christmas, Findus. Merry Christmas, Pettersson. Look. There's a gift under the tree. Maybe it's for you. Here's another one. Maybe for you? They are so cool. Open it up! Wait, my back is itching again. Open it then! What could this be? Well, do you like it? A... A homemade back scratcher! With a rear-view mirror. Thanks, dear Findus. What is that, Pettersson? Come on. Let's take a closer look. What is that? The Northern Lights, Findus. It's the best I have ever seen. This is the best Christmas ever, Pettersson. Yes, Findus. It sure is. Who is it? Me. Happo, sit. Good boy. The milk. Gustavsson. -That's very kind. Thanks. -No trouble at all. Carrots! Looks yummy. I should get going now. My Christmas feast is waiting for me at home. Right. Enjoy. Thanks. I should get going now since at home, I have... a Christmas feast! -Enjoy. -I will. So I'm going home now to eat my Christmas feast! Gustavsson? -Is everything okay? -Absolutely. No. My God, again! Christmas feast! Goodness! Hello, Pettersson. Hello, Findus. Beda. What are you doing here? I only wanted to get a few things for you, but then I bumped into Gustavsson and his family. And old Svensson and his family tagged along as well. This really isn't necessary. We're fine by ourselves. Pettersson! Thanks, Beda. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for coming. Pettersson! -Merry Christmas, Pettersson! -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas to you. -Merry Christmas. Chocolate pudding! That's just what I wished for. Isa, it's so nice to have you here. -My neighbor friend. -My friend. Neighbor. -Hello, girls! -A rooster! I'll get him! -The festivity of joyful ends... -And of friends! -Yes, like that! -Just like that! Wow, that was so cool! Crazy! Subtitle translation by Matthew Way
