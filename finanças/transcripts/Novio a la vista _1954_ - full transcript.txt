BOYFRIEND IN SIGHT EUROPE 1918 It won't fail me this time! It's just impossible! - It can't be! - What is this? Tell me something about the Bourbon dynasty. The kings of the House of Bourbon are Felipe V. Luis I. Fernando VI, Carlos Ill. Carlos IV, - Fernando VII… - Very good. - Isabel II. Alfonso XII and Father. - Very good. That's easy, they should ask me about my grandparents. Garcia Hurtado. Don Enrique. Garcia Hurtado! Garcia Hurtado! Gosh. the prince is done. Where'd I put my lucky tooth? Loli put it there. You think it's lucky? Loli said it never fails. Just remember. the Hundred Years' War in this palm. The Reconquista in the other. Here's the Gallic Wars. and here's Central Europe. All right. Thanks a lot. Afternoon. Won't you tell me— Let's see. Won't you tell me… something about Central Europe. specifically. everything you know about the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austro - Hungarian Empire? - Yes, indeed. The second question from the lesson on Central Europe. From the geography text which you have surely studied. Well. the Austro-Hungarian Empire… is located in Central Europe. The Austro-Hungarian Empire is comprised of the Austrian Empire and the Hungarian Empire ever since the Treaty of Utrecht. Well. since the Treaty of Utrecht from the Hundred Years' War. Returning to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, we can say. regarding its extension. that its geographical extension is three square kilometers. What? Well. not that small. We can say that it's 3,000 kilometers. 3.000 kilometers. It's divided between… the low provinces. properly speaking. in the south, and the high ones. which follow: the high eastern and high western provinces. We should also mention, among other important cities, Vienna. which is the capital of the immense Austro-Hungarian Empire, situated in Central Europe, the capital of which, as I've said. is Vienna. Are you going on vacation this summer. Mr. Garcia Hurtado? Yes. sir. Then don't forget to pack your geography text in your suitcase. You're dismissed. - What's that good - for - nothing doing? - I think that's fine. It's exactly 12:23. We'll go up the pass in the dark. Poor thing. they probably gave him the exam for honors. - He didn't pick up a book all year. - But Enriquito is very clever. Enrique, the chest! We forgot about the chest. You forgot about the chest. It's not the same thing. - Where does this go? - Just a moment. Shouldn't we check it instead? If Enriquito takes a half hour— He needs to show up right now with a passing grade in geography. With a decent grade! if not. he'll get it! Hush. The poor thing is under so much pressure. Does this go to the beach or on the kid? Hey. this is the spot. You got it? Come on. toss it over. This is X-13. This is X-13. Seeking whereabouts of Agent X-23. Find X-23. They say she's suspending an angel. - Cease at once! - It's a miracle! A holy emissary orders you. Bear in mind. ye pitiless executioner of Christians. that my faith is far more powerful than your cruel inclemency. Nay. your sword shall not strike down my spirit nor break my resolve. Your sword. faithless prince. shall not touch a single hair of Gertrude, servant of the Lord. And while the punishment of eternal flames awaits you. the damsel Gertrude. just like all students of the school— Loli, go to the garden. X-13 is calling you. - I can't. Tell him to wait. - He's in a hurry. Fine, hold this. Just put Loli on, silly. Who? X-27 here. How are you. X-13? Returning good luck charm. Doesn't work. Geography failed? - Failed. - I just don't get it. Authentic black man's tooth stolen from father's clinic. You're mistaken. Really your aunt's tooth. Returning. In a hurry. Parents waiting for me. Leaving early for Lindamar. Leaving tomorrow, 9:15 PM train. - You'll see how well I swim. - Loli. the nuns are coming. Quick message. Bulgarian spies. See you on the beach. Come in. X-27. Come in. X-27, come in! - The line must be cut. - Come in. - What's wrong? - Let me try. - Here. I'm off. Bye. - Bye. - Come in. This is X - 1000. - What? This is X-1000. Giving password for our next communication. The password is: mask and dynamite. The revolution! Come on. now. Where have you been? Let me see your report card. Summer vacation! Summer vacation! - It's summer vacation! - You're making me dizzy. It's summer vacation! Kaiser. it's summer vacation! Did you hear? Stop it. Loli! Have you heard? It's summer vacation! Yay! My daughter. You're out of your mind. Loli. We're going on vacation We're going on vacation Girl! At the beach in Lindamar - This is no way to behave! - No way to behave? You sound like Mother Superior. Have some respect. At your age, it's time you settled down. Say. Kaiser. Will you miss me? I hope you don't forget me. Put down the dog. You'll stain your uniform. My racket. I almost forgot it. - What are you putting in there? - Two pairs of silk stockings. - Silk? For whom? - For you. I bought them this morning. But I've never worn them. It's about time you did. You're not a little girl anymore. My white dress. We're going on vacation On vacation at the— Mother, it's shrunk. No. darling. Those fabrics don't shrink. You've grown. Hurry. girl. You deserve a hiding. You've been in the water half an hour. Let's go. THE DELIGHTS - Hurry, let's go. - Jesus. Joseph and Mary. - Come on! - I'm falling! - The fee for the seat. please. 10 cents. - One moment. - How's the water? - A bit colder than yesterday. Watch out for the torpedoes, General. I'm not afraid of torpedoes. let alone German ones. General. German torpedoes will win the war! General. with or without torpedoes. the Germans will lose the war. - And right here in the Mediterranean. - How's that? Unbelievable. How's that? I had no idea Ballester was a general. Nor did he. The highest he got in the army was draft dodger. Then… They served together in Cuba and think they've seen war. Every summer. they advance one rank higher. They've been calling each other general for the last two years. Childish nonsense. Say no more. My father-in-law left me without teaspoons or sugar when he recounted the Battle of the Marne. And your husband? Exempted from service for his narrow chest. so the others paid him no mind. But this year he brought the saber of his uncle who was a brigadier. They'll have no choice but to promote him. - It's moving. - What? A curtain in the Villanuevas' chalet. - No. they haven't arrived. It's the wind. - Just as I suspected. They never leave Cestona before July 5th. - They also take the waters in Cestona? - Don't you know the Villanuevas? Waters in Cestona. swimming in Lindamar and oxygen in La Granja And all in perfect measure. They swim every other day. They swim nine times then rest three days. - Every other day? Why? - You don't know? More than nine times will give you rheumatism. And if you go to excess. it's galloping consumption. Look! He'll surely catch his death. - Sure it was here? - Absolutely. Twenty-four paces right. three forward, and two hands deep. - But they put this hut on top. - You think the enemy gang got it? When? Last summer? Enrique left a day before we did. And Gordo is a real fool. Here it is. I've got it, but can't get it out. - Here. you try. - Step aside. All right. Find it? I've got it. - What? - Something bit me. What's the matter? - Gordo. - Where? I saw his head. He's stolen our map. - And he bit me too. - Let's get him! - There's Gordo. - Let's go. Bah! Nonsense. Monstrous invention! What's your opinion of tanks. Amorós? What's that? - What's your opinion of tanks? - What's that? I said— Nothing. Can't hear a damn thing. Enrique, save me! - You stole it! - Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. 1212. - Gordo. why not join our gang? - We'll give you a chocolate. - With a picture card? - Yes. - Of bullfighters or singers? - Singers. - Fat ones or skinny ones? - Fat ones. No way I'll join your gang. Battle of Calatañazor. - Are you studying or not? - Studying. It's your duty to use your time wisely. I'll take a stroll with your mother. Lindamar, one minute! Here. Vicente. - Take this. - Hey. there! - Take this. - Hey. there! That's my suitcase! - Yeah. that one. - This one? - No. the other one. - I'm sorry. - Loli. hi! - Loli. Hey. Gordo. Hi. Pecas. I stole the map of her gang's canon and machine-gun. Don't lie! It was a decoy. - Have you seen Enrique? - No. and I don't want to. He's grounded. He doesn't know about Northern America. - What's new. Gordo? - Look who's downstairs. How you doing. Loli? - What's eating her? - You didn't meet her at the station. Just a minute. - You're losing spies. - Back to your gang! - When I want. - I'll clobber you. I'll tell Pepote and he's my boyfriend. I'll smack you. - She's not grabbing it? - Loli. grab it. Come on, a little more slack. More. more. Attention. X-1000. You're ordered to capture X-27 immediately. dead or alive. He says to capture you dead or alive. What a laugh. My shirt shrunk in half. She says: What a laugh. Her shirt shrunk in half. - He says to respect the boss. - I've got no boss now. I'm on vacation. No spy here. She says to go to hell. No. I won't say that. All right. I'm leaving. Raise the phone. You're so silly. I'm not even upset. Well, looks like you missed. Very nice. Don Vicente. If only I'd put chalk on the stick. You're about to witness a real shot. Excuse me. Vicente! Unbelievable! The cue ball. Vicente's quite the curious one. Anybody find out about her? I did. She's a foreigner. - Jesus. Mary and Joseph. - Are you serious? I have it on good authority. As we were saying. I met a certain Villanueva family from Cádiz— Our Villanuevas? A cousin of theirs was ship's lieutenant. Who knows if maybe— Don't forget the Villanuevas from Logroño. They've got nothing to do with them. That's not what I heard. What a lovely cool evening. If they heard in Madrid that we have to sleep with a blanket. - You sleep with a blanket? - Of course! Unbelievable. If you'll excuse me, are you done with the water? - Don't drink it all. with your liver. - Don't you worry. dear. What rubbish. San Millán beats them all! He floundered in reconnaissance. What are you saying. General? You were not at Cerro Pequeño. - Nor were you. General. - But Amorós was. What's your opinion of San Millán at Cerro Pequeño? - What's that? - What's your opinion — The map's still in his trumpet. - Who'll get it out? - We'll draw lots. I don't feel like it. Let's go to the breakwater. Loli. what are you doing? - Shutting off the lighthouse. - What? Really. - Look. - Don't be silly. - I really feel like swimming. - Now? - Tomorrow. - No way. You'll be grounded again. Don't be too sure. Go ahead. ask me about Northern America. - Name the capital of Russia. - Your mother. - Idiot. - You're the idiot. - Look. there they are. - Who? I don't see anyone. It's the enemy gang. Pepote and Charo next to the cave. - Let's surround them. - Forget it. - Pepote! - Hey. that's Enrique! - Come over here. - Come here. - What are you doing? - Catching crabs. - Just look at them. - We've caught a bunch. The basket's almost full. Here's another. This one's really fat. - Look. just like you. The fat one. - Maybe so. but I got the map. We don't care. We've invented another secret canon. - We'll capture that one too. Right, X - 13? - Yeah, that too. - I caught one! - Felipe doesn't even dare. - Take one. They don't bite. - Their pinchers can cut. Don't be a scaredy-cat. They won't bite. Ow! They don't bite? Everybody quiet. a boat. She was on the train. with a very strange hat. - Must be a spy. - Shut up. - Think she's a ghost? - No. a blood - sucking vampire. Look. she's standing up. And lifting her veil. And now… now… she's opening a box. - She takes out some pliers. - Pliers! - She tests them. - She tests them. She's folding some papers. - She sets down the ribbon. - Hear that? A ribbon! A ribbon? Good Lord. it's outrageous. What else? Go on! Just as I told you. bangs, kiss-curls and a hair band. Hello! Hello! The one with glasses just a mite bit higher. There. Thank you. Just a little higher. Hold still. here comes the birdie. What's this birdie nonsense? It's a camera obscura, not a birdcage. Wait for me! Everybody here? Just a moment. On one. two and- The birdie! Do as you're told. Behave yourself. I got the map from the trumpet. What do we do with it? Give it here. - Always stay in the shade. - Don't eat before lunchtime! Eat slowly and don't fight. Don't forget to eat the filets. the bread and cheese. - I'll take care of them. Don't worry. - The hake. the hard - boiled eggs. And the ham and the melon. Here. - Well. - Don't open it before mealtime. 8:20. Time to head out to sea. At 10:38. stopover at Cabo Espeso. We stroll. view the gulf and drink some water. We descend. then leisure activities. Forward! Prow northward! - Good - bye! - Good - bye! Good-bye! What a travesty. No purse and carrying a camera. Those Russian women! You said yesterday she was a bullfighter's Catalonian mistress. Not on your life! She's a Russian divorcée. - Your aunt? - More of a great aunt. - The poor thing. - It was a heavy blow. I've ordered the mourning clothes from Madrid. but for now, this armband will have to do. - What a tragedy. - A man is waving to us over there. - Where? - Don't you see? There in the water. - Who could it be? - He's waving his arms around. Out there in the water. far from shore. You only see his head and he waves like this. - Shall we wave to him, Clotilde? - Yes. it's only proper. - Hello. - Hi. - I don't see him. - No matter. He's vanished underwater. - So very strange. isn't it? - Yes. Such bad manners. Wait. but he might be— The German left flank is wavering. General. Haven't you read today's report? Balderdash. Haven't you read the article of Armando Guerra? It's the allied right flank that's fleeing in disarray. Is it fleeing in disarray or not. Amorós? - What's that? - Impossible. it's pointless. What a nuisance. Now I understand why he says the whistling shells didn't bother him. Between you and me. I saw him run on a certain occasion. How about that bayonet attack at Playa Chica? Where was Amoros? Behind a pine tree! Making you descend from the treetop where you'd taken refuge. All the better to survey the enemy lines. - It's suicide. - What abuse. It's scandalous. - Beyond the pale. - Just plain suicide. - Running in the sun without a hat. - Then he'll go swimming. - You can't be serious! - He's quite capable. And sweating too. He's out of his mind. - He ate breakfast just two hours ago. - That's all? You must allow six hours at the minimum. Six hours. If not. it halts the digestion. a dizzy spell comes and bam. to the bottom. Like that poor man the lifeguard just pulled out. He'd eaten a banana! Good Lord. with Loli on a field trip! Don't worry. they're with my husband. He'll keep them out of trouble. - You can do it! - I bet he doesn't dare. Watch how it's done. Flex. inhale and into the water. It's really high. Just close your eyes and into the void. Your father's so different. The sun's gotten to him. Some even go mad. Move aside! I'll give you a ducking. - Please. no. It's really scary. - Come on. silly. You'll see the fish. Move aside. I said! I'm gonna jump! You brute! I swallowed water. Here goes. And a-one. and a-two. and a-two and a half, and a-two and three quarters… What a crash. What happened? Are you hurt? Come on! What's the matter with you. diving into the sand? Out of the way! Here I come! Enrique. Now you're gonna get it. - I run faster than you. - I let you get away. What a dirty face. Let me clean it off. I could've hit you in the eye. I'd be blind. You'd have to marry me. Yes. or you'd be working at the tobacco stand. - It's nice here. isn't it? - What if they come looking? We're alone. Even better. though my father says not to waste time on women. - But you're not a woman. - Then what am I? - A kid. - You must be kidding. I'm 15. Yeah, me too. So what? Some queens even married at 12. Because they were forced to and you're no queen. No? How do you know? What if my parents aren't my real parents? - What if I'm a princess? - A princess. Exactly. Hear me out. As a girl. I lived in a palace. There was a war. The nursemaid spirited me away through a tunnel. Then we escaped by boat. But the boat went and sank. The poor nursemaid drowned and I was picked up by a dentist. What? Don't think it's true? Look. another boat. Let's see if it sinks with a queen. A boat! It's a boat! A boat? Just a moment! L-O-N. Lon-don. Must be English. As I was saying. I fry them well, add one beat egg. ham and butter. - That's very bad for the liver. - But it does wonders for me. One to the right. two from the back one to the right. - And the rest? - All to the right. You must teach me. Vicente. what nerve! I've told you before. tell me what you see or I'll hide the field-glasses. A wave. another wave. another. another. a boy with a pail. another boy with a pail. another boy with his mama. Mama. Mama. - Mama! - Vicente! What nerve. Another boy. a wave, another wave, a boy with a pail. another boy with a pail. - It's the Villanuevas! - The Villanuevas? - It's the Villanuevas. - They're here! They've gained weight. - They've lost weight. - But they're stronger. What class. - Let me see. - Yes! - What outfits! So elegant! - See the high waist? - It's clear they're worth millions. - Lots. They're all here. Don Adolfo. Doña Adelvina. Adolfín. Manolito. Isabelita and— - There's one more! - One more? - He's got a mustache. - He's very tall. - Don't know him. - One of the Logroño Villanuevas? They're going swimming. they're entering the huts. - Did they wait after eating? - No matter. they're the Villanuevas. Stretch your arms out. Flex your waist muscles. - Buck up. you on the right. - We've got them now. Very good on the left side there. That's the spirit! Biceps flexed. Legs at an angle of 45 degrees to the ground. Mens sana in corpore sano. Come on. pull! - Tell Gordo to pull more. - Make Gordo pull more. Gordo's not pulling! Pull. Gordo! Come on! He's not here. He's not there? Where could he be? - I don't see him anywhere. - You don't? - Come on. let's look for him. - Where could he be? - Look. Look down there. - My God. What a calamity! I see something big there. - That's a rock. - Poor Gordo. - He drowned before lunchtime. - How horrible! - Think of his family. - He's over there! And he's eating our lunch! I'll let him have it! Stay calm. Let's be civil about this. Not even one filet left! Where's my mortadella. Gordo? And the chocolate fritters! And my bread pudding? - And my cream puffs? - He's got some nerve! Did you also eat my foie gras sandwich? Then we've lost the map. I hid it inside. Are they pitted? But of course. sir. - Yes, olives. - Olives. Imagine that! - These Villanuevas. - He's one of the real Villanuevas? From head to toe. - A nephew of Don Adolfo's. - You can tell. - Not only handsome. but an engineer. - You don't say. He's at the hydroelectric. - He seems very proper. a good son. - But is he really a bachelor? As single as they come. The best prospect of the whole summer. The boat. the children are back. - There they are! - There's the boat! The children are back. - Hello, Mother. - Loli. come with me. Hurry. You'll see. what a surprise! - Hi, Mom. - What a surprise. You're so dirty. Your hair's a mess. You look like a Zulu. It was so fun! Dad took us to the top of a cliff and… And from there I explained how to determine the cardinal points. Now it's time to study the mountain ranges of the Americas. She looks so cute. Just look at her. Just look! What a coquette! Girl. don't be so stiff. It's not that hard to walk in heels. Just beautiful. Look how it drapes across you. Of course. she's a woman now. She should dress like one. All that childish game playing is over. Let's see. Turn around. - Say. let me take this in. - No, it's fine like that. Go on. walk a little. - So cute. - She's so terribly cute. Mother. I can't go on. My feet hurt. Besides. with these heels… Naturally. Your mother lets you run around barefoot all day. jumping. running… Well. now that you're all grown up. you should spend time with the adults. And someday soon you'll pick out a good husband. Think about it. Loli. What more could you ask for? - Forget that band of hooligans. - Loli! - Loli! - Aren't you coming? The hooligans! Loli. come down! - What do you want? - Isn't Loli coming? We're waiting. She's not coming down. She's going with us. - Where's she going? - Enough! With us and the other adults. - Let's go. - Come on. guys. Let's go. we'll be late. We're bound to miss a dance. As long as we make it for the waltz. Come. girl. Aren't you happy to be all dressed up? - I don't know. - Come. girl! - They make such a beautiful couple. - Loli's just gorgeous. absolutely gorgeous. And he's so dashing. He's exactly like his father. - You're quite right. - Hi. cutie. - You don't like dancing? - Not much. - Then let's stop. - As you like. Just a moment. Mind if I take off my shoes? - Are they tight? - Yes. They even gave me a rash. - What a pain. It's the very first time. - First time? Yes, Mother and Auntie insisted on dressing me as a grown-up. - You aren't grown up? - Not at all. I'm just a kid. - How old are you? - Fifteen. See? Alone and barefoot, I dance well. - Are you an engineer? - Nothing I could do about it. And what do you make. bridges? Well, no. I work in an office. What a shame. I absolutely love boats and the sea. - Do you like the sea? - I do. - Do you know how to swim? - A bit. I swim like this. - How do you do it? - Me? Like this. Enrique's the one who can swim. - Who's Enrique? - A friend. - Is he 15 as well? - Yes. but he's turning 16. - I suppose you play together. - We have a gang. Enrique is the boss. Gordo is X-1000. There's also an enemy gang. We stole their map. And then Gordo went and ate it. - What are you laughing at? - Everything. It's quite funny. So Gordo ate the map? Of course. You're a grown-up and these things seem funny to you. No wonder. It's only natural. - They want her to marry the engineer. - Really? - They won't let her come with us? - Look. if she's getting married… - What do you think. Enrique? - Beats me. Let's go. Yeah. let's get out of here. Come on. hurry. Is that Enrique? - Who? - Him. Yes. - Look how she's eyeing the engineer. - Yesterday she photographed the generals. - She did? - She's definitely a spy. Didn't we decide she's a trapeze artist who poisoned the lion tamer? - God knows! - Hello! - Who are you waving at? - There in the water. Must be a friend. He waves at me like this. Hello! - Yes. now I see him! - Hello! Hey. someone's drowning! - Good - bye. - Good - bye. He's so kind. He has to be a Villanueva. Let's see if we can agree on organizing the fair. No. fairs aren't done anymore. What we must do is hold a benefit performance for someone. - But for whom? - We'll find someone. It should be just like the one we held in Cestona. - We can serve hors d'oeuvres. - And finish with a fireworks display. - How reckless. What if we explode? - Then what shall we do? We'll put on an operetta. We have Federico Villanueva. - He sings so well. - He's the model son. With such a future. An engineer at the hydroelectric. He must know an awful lot. If a turbine was placed in the breakwater. electricity could be generated. - In the breakwater? - Yes. exactly. Have you heard of the tides? In class at school. Have you been to the theater much? I went once last year. But I prefer the movies. I've been once. They showed a woman getting tied to the train tracks. Then a man with a derby and cane. - A derby? - He walked like this. You do that very well. - The Balkan crisis has no solution. - lt's just awful. Don José. - What do you say of the offensive… - I won't say a thing. - Imagine. a woman sitting alone! - She's Polish. - Impossible! - She's drinking champagne. Oh. magnifique. These foreign women are unbelievable. - Look, a Villanueva! - A Villanueva! - He's so tall! - What a catch! - He swims every day. - You're kidding. Without waiting? Without waiting after meals. And he sunbathes as well. - Really? - Yes. Very funny. those kids. HELLO. X-27 Come in. X-27 speaking. X-13 angry. Spies don't cry. But I'm not a spy anymore. You are X-27. Report official enemy data. I still don't know much about him. He's an engineer. always talking about reservoirs. - Strategic ones? - I don't know. He doesn't carry maps. X-13. listen. Can I call you Enrique? Enrique. what are you doing? Lean out a bit. More. More, don't be afraid. Come on. You look so ugly from below. I can't tell if it's you or your aunt. Not my aunt again. Don't mention her again. "Think about it. Loli. What more could you want? Dressing up. going out with grown-ups." Your aunt's just bitter because she's single. She could've married whoever she wanted. but she didn't want to leave Grandma alone. I won't get married either. - What will you do then? - Travel. I'll travel the whole world with a dancer. - Without marrying? - Of course without marrying. I won't love you. - I don't care. - You will care. I'll be very elegant. wearing lots of feathers. like the women in Blanco y Negro. You'll love me truly. I only love Gordo. He's a real pal. ldiot. I'm leaving the gang. Fine. I'll demote you. You're lowered from X-27 to X-50. - So what? - You'll get the firing squad. - Blindfolded? - Blindfolded. Great. I won't see you again. Tell me. capricious woman Why do you trifle with my heart? You sip nectar. gracious butterfly In the fragrant garden of love No, just a minute. Not so low. Fa. Re. Do. Sol. Mi. Wait until I cue you. Tell me. tell me. capricious woman No. we could send a money order to the sisters of the Holy Charity of Blessed Cajetano. Not on your life. They have more money than Rockefeller. We'll give it to the parish for Saint Patrick's altar. - What if we gave it to the poor? - Yes! How nice. A splendid idea! The poor need our charity. - But which ones? - I know one in Madrid. He's always at the corner with his dog. Don't expect us to go fetch him. - In the heat of Madrid? - I'm certain there's typhus. - With your permission. ladies. - Of course. - Don't mention it. - Thank you. What? Who ordered you to put up those flags? They came this way from the shop. Lies! This is an anti-patriotic and anti-Germanic maneuver of General Ballester. who's a mason. If those flags are hung at this party, I'll announce the withdrawal of our friends. the Central Powers. - They're just decorations. Look. - Decorations! Have you ever seen a decorative flag? There are battle flags, ceremonial flags. signal flags. parade flags, banner girls. - But never a decoration. - Well, but— Under my command. you'd be in the brig already. Here. make yourself useful. Hold this up. Hearken. my dove To my sweet lullaby of love Of love, of love Can't you sit properly? - I'm fine like this. - You're fine? A young woman like you should adopt another aspect, another behavior. I'm really bored. Turn the pages of the sheet music so Federico can sing. - That's right. go with Federico. - Villanueva! I want to go with my friends. That band of hooligans? By no means! They're waiting to execute me by firing squad. Enough childish games. You're a woman. No. next year. Let me play with my friends this summer. Loli, there will be no further discussion. Turn the pages of sheet music or go to your room. - Hello. - Yes. Mother. We can donate to the father of the laundress. He's paralyzed By no means. In the last load. she ruined two of my shirts. Of love, of love I offer you the sweet nectar of kisses. my dove In my song Tell us. what are they doing? The guy with the mustache brought in some weights. - How heavy? Does it say? - 1000 kilos. - They're made of rubber. - Let me go up. come on. - No. the tower will collapse. - I'm not heavy. I'm hollow inside. - What's the blonde doing? - Well— Look who's coming! Hi. Hi. - I said hi. - We heard you. - What's that supposed to mean? - Why are you here? - To play with you guys. - You're not one of us. You're with the grown-ups and that man. You're too big to play with us. Go back to your boyfriend. Kick him in the shins! What a drubbing. Let him have it. Loli. Hey. we'll fall down. Careful! - Come on. - In the head. Enrique. - Hit him hard. Loli! - He's winning. By the nose! Hit her hard. come on! Hit her hard! - Let go! - You let go! Both at the same time. - I'll stay with you. - You won't go home? - We'll hide you. - We'll protect you from your mother. Let us talk to her. It's pointless. They'll dress me up and won't let me come with you. - Then don't go back. We'll hide you. - Yeah. we will. - Where will we go? - To the castle ruins. Yeah! We'll declare war on the grown-ups. - Then we're all in agreement? - Yes! We need provisions and something to eat. Right. Hide in your rooms. Tomorrow at 6:00. we meet in front of the hotel and go to the ruins. right? My sweet lullaby of love Of love, of love I offer you the sweet nectar of kisses. my dove Oh. how wise she is Hearken to my sweet lullaby of love Of love, of love I offer you the sweet nectar of kisses. my dove In my song Everyone ready! Antonio. what are you doing? Right. dear. My mind was elsewhere. Dolores! Our clothes! Get up, Pepito. They've stolen our clothes! What? Come on. hurry. We have to set up camp. Hurry up. Let's go. What's that racket? - What's wrong? - I don't know. - What is it? - Loli's not in her room! She's not there! My son! Enriquito isn't in his room! He's not in his room! He's disappeared. Come on. Pepito. Always in such a hurry! Loli has disappeared. - What's happened? - Your son's missing as well. What? My son! - I'm going to faint! - Ma'am. please. She fainted. Just one minute. There's a note. Wait. Good Lord. I just can't take any more. What does it say? It's addressed "to the grown-ups." "Since you insist that Loli must become a grown-up - and won't let her play with us" - - ".we're taking her" — Give me! "We're taking her and we declare war on you. We won't come home until you swear"— "… that you will let her be and cease pestering her with grown-up dresses and shoes." "These are our conditions. If you say no. we won't come home. If you say yes, we will. We're just fine in the castle ruins. Hugs and kisses from everyone." Signed "everyone." Whatever will become of my poor child? What? Still haven't settled on the charity? - Silence! - We must make a decision. - What an outrage! - They deserve a good hiding. Why not send them to boarding school? - We'll retrieve them immediately. - We must inform the police at once! Just a moment. We'll retrieve them. but after breakfast. First starve them out. and then attack. What's that? Never eaten better in my life. - Me neither. - I can't hear a thing. - Getting anything out of that? - No. - Just suck on it. silly. - It's really big. Don't smoke. Be like me. Mens sana in poultry sano. - It won't hurt. Just suck on it. - But — But what? - Doesn't even know how to smoke. - Got that right. Come on. breakfast is over. Time to work. Our peace is over. Hey. fasten the flag well. Don't let it fall. Don't worry. it won't. Hey. guys. Here's more buckshot. - Where'd you get this wire? - From the chicken coop. Fantastic. Stake the posts. Aim carefully. - Let's start. right? - Yes. Attention. everyone. We'll start making traps number one and number two. The jars of marmalade over there. And this. put it over there. Let's see. Come on. girls. Not the green ones. They could really hurt. - Is this a battle or not? - How can I throw pinecones at my dad? You throw at the others and I'll throw one at him. At my dad? We won't throw at our dads. but it's not our fault if the others do. But they won't even dare. With these too? - The approach. - Is it worked out? - To the millimeter. - Then let's go. - Car one ready. - Garrido family. - Car two ready. - Peláez family. Car two ready. - That's us. let's go. - Come. - Peláez family. take your places. - Hurry. didn't you hear him? Vinueza family. - Car three ready. - García Hurtado family. We'll get in. Come. dear. - Car four ready. - Cortina family. Cortina. That's us. Come now. hurry. Let's sit down. You'll command the rear guard. - Come on. Pepito. - Coming. - Get in. please. - Have enough gas? - Taking your own sweet time! - I'm ready! - ls the entire convoy ready? - Ready. sir. Hurry and get into the car. Where could he be? Get in. Advance! Hey. what about my husband? There's no time to lose. ma'am. Let's go! Fine. let's go then. - Now what's wrong? - The magneto doesn't work. ma'am. - What? Magnesium? - You have to get out. sir. - Come, Mother. - We have to get out and push! Let's go. Now it's working fine! - Nails. - Here. place them well. Got it. Hey. they're coming! - Give me more nails. - We're out. Are they pointing up? - Yes. - Let's go. Come on. let's go. - Hurry up. - The cars are coming. Would you shut up? They'll see us. Quick. hide. Halt! Everyone out! Keep calm! Everyone. stay calm. Nothing's wrong. You have the honor of commanding the right flank. - You. the left flank. - At your orders! Put the cars underneath those trees at once. Forward! Follow me. - Forward! - Let's get 'em! No. the castle's up there. - Let's get 'em! - Forward. everyone! - Attack. Quickly! - Let's get 'em. I like it. We'll show them what the Peláez family is like on the battlefield. That's right. the Peláez and Renovales families. If only your poor father were here. I certainly will not go soft on her. This is a day she'll never forget. My son will see. Look. it's mallow. I'll pick some. Oh, yes. It's good for congestion. What did we come here for? Come on. forward. Pay her no mind. Just boil this in water and it works wonders. Oh. my kidneys. - I think I hear voices. - Yeah, I hear something too. How funny. The Peláezes are coming too. We'll show you! This mountain must be a nest of scorpions. My God. just what kind of ruins have they gotten themselves into? They're facing north. Bronchitis for sure. - Look! - They've raised a little flag! A little flag! It's bigger than the crown of a pine tree. Good Lord! My new blouse! - What an outrage! - Let's continue. Let's go get them. We will show no leniency. - We'll give them a drubbing. - The need a proper beating. It's a shame we don't have a map. They're really close. - We have to hide. - Then hide. Nobody moves until I call open fire. - All right. - Yeah. all right. But they're still so far away. You've got them backwards. stupid. Attention. everybody. Crouch down. Gordo. You really stand out. When they get to the mark. fire, but no sooner. Now! Now! Take that. and that! They'll kill us. - I'm not afraid! You can't touch me! - Hooligans! - You can't touch me! - Madness! Pinecones! They haven't been disinfected! Felipe. Son. It's your mother! Good-for-nothing. you'll pay for that failing grade! Peláez family. charge from the left! That's right. The Peláez family must charge! Little rascal! Scoundrel! What a rascal! Mother! That's the spirit! - Now you'll see. - Here. - Here. - Give me another. Lucky shot! Get the Peláezes! Give me more! - Get more pinecones! - This is monstrous. That stings! What animals! Hit the deck! Hit 'em hard! Peláezes and Castros. charge from the right! The Peláez family is failing us! It's simply impossible to do anything without a map. - Continue forward! - Continue forward? No. not me! Come on! Get the Castros! - A map! - I told the Peláezes to charge! Help. Pepito! What happened? My God! Pepito! There she goes! Give me your hand. Get them out of there! Cease fire! We've got many casualties. Another humiliation! Look at them run! We won! We've won the battle. but they may attack again. Collect the pinecones. - You'll be our Mata Hari. - Yes. When night falls. approach the enemy camp and discover their plans. All right. I will. - Goodness. I can't go on. - What's happened? If only we'd had a map. If the Pelaez family had charged. we would've taken their fort. Don't fool yourself. Without advance bombardment. it's useless to attack. An implicit censure of my leadership? I have respect for your person, but I cannot respect your tactics. You must know that the tactic of a speedy attack without preparation has always produced excellent results in wars like the present. By that I mean colonial wars. That tactic has always failed. Remember Pino Quemado, if you will. If you'd remained at your post. we wouldn't have lost the war. - Calling me a coward? - You call me inept! - It seems we've lost the battle. - The Pelaez family lost it. The Peláez family withstood a hail of pinecones on the front lines. chest out. That's right. chest out. While you fooled around far out of range of the pinecones. That's right. the pinecones. The high command must always remain out of range of the pinecones- bullets. I will direct the next attack. but with a map. And if the Peláezes don't fail me. I told you we did not fail! Yes. very well. It could happen to anyone. I too was afraid as a child, but now. place yourselves under my command. You've been in the reserves since the times of Espartero. - What's that? - Go back to the hotel. Yeah. go home. He cannot relieve me of my command. I have seniority. I outrank all of you! Remember that I was in command at Alamogordo. - Let's not speak of Alamogordo. - Then let's speak of Cerro Bermejo! If you had good memory. you'd do better not to recall your actions at Cerro Bermejo. Gentlemen. let's not argue any further. We must come to a decision. - You could starve them out. - No starving! - What will we do then? - Anything. but quickly. The kids are bound to catch pneumonia. - Yes. my boy surely forgot his scarf! - And mine his vest! We can debate no longer. Who's in charge now? Me. - Gentlemen. it's my right. - I'm the one with rights. Before such a difference of opinion. the civilian authorities must take charge. Shut your face! To hell with civilian authorities! I have a plan. We will deploy under cover of darkness. The Vinuezas over here. The Castros over there. The Peláez will take the rear guard, and here the— I'm afraid we don't have enough forces to carry out my plan. - The Villanuevas should be here. - That's right. the Villanuevas. Especially their nephew. the engineer. He could devise trenches. Simply absurd. A Villanueva beset by pinecones! And him in particular. Such a fine lad. Such a good son. I don't doubt it. He's so proper. All right. Don't make noise. I can't hear anything. - You know something? - What? I wish this battle was real. and that I was really wounded, and that you were caring for me. But only a shoulder wound, eh? I don't like being a nurse. I'd rather be Agent X-27. Even if it means the firing squad? Doesn't matter. Almost all spies end up that way. Enrique. - Isn't it a shame? - What? - We're growing up. - You're right. I don't even kick rocks anymore. Have you noticed that grown-ups never kick rocks? Yes. I won't enjoy being a grown-up. Me neither. I can't go back to playing again. I like other things more. - Like what? - I don't know. Being at your side. but alone. Will you be angry if I tell you something? - Do you want to be my girlfriend? - Yes. Then we're boyfriend and girlfriend. Yes. Now what? - Should I give you a kiss? - Yes. Now you. - Hey. Enrique. someone's coming. - We cried halt and nothing. Let's see. You stay here. Come on. Halt! Who goes there? Halt, I said! - He won't answer. - Do we open fire? Just give him a scare. Hold your fire! I come in peace! Careful! I'll shoot a flare at him. I come in peace! Wow. it's Amorós. - It's a trap! - I don't know. one minute. Boys. I've come to request a post in your ranks. - But you're really old. - What's that? - The ear trumpet. - Thank you. - I said you're really old. - That doesn't matter. I want to show those inept generals what Amorós is capable of. So. will you let me join your ranks? Sure. but you won't throw pinecones. I will employ my military knowledge in the defense of the courtyard. This will be the Waterloo of those two-bit strategists. - Are you well stocked with munitions? - More than four cartloads of pinecones! - And all the rockets for the festival. - Bravo. Listen. concentrate all your firepower on the Peláez family. That's the weak point of your enemy. - Very good. - That's right. Hurrah for Amorós! It's a perfect plan. Everyone. on your feet. Remember to stay concealed. And don't forget to carry out my orders exactly. Let's get them. What a colossal error. We'll teach them a lesson. I'll never forgive my son. What were these good-for-nothings thinking? Now we'll show them what the Peláezes are made of! Yes, we will! - What? - What do we do now? Let them gain confidence in the light of the flares. Then you can aim with more precision. What do you think of my tactics? This time we'll take them off guard. - They're receiving us with flares. - These are the beacon lights of victory! Maybe the Peláez family will charge. - I can't see a thing. - All I can do is— Hold it! Have your fuses lit and aim your rockets well! - Stay calm. - Mother! - Rascal! - Calm! Mother. this is a powder keg! - The Pelaez family is very close. - Hit them hard! Quickly! - I'm burning! - Calm down. - We can do it! - My dress! It's burning. Mother! Look. Wonderful. the smell of gunpowder! My hat! My new hat! Back to the camp. Organize your ranks. Back to the camp. Thanks. kids. This victory is yours. You are all truly courageous. Long live Mr. Amorós! The Peláez family failed us again. The Peláez family is unwilling to be burnt to a crisp just because a lady insists on debuting her daughter in an evening gown. I'm within my rights to make my girl grow up when I want to. We're within our rights not to be sent on fools' errands in the countryside because you feel like it. I never asked anyone to come. You never asked, but because of you, our kids headed for the hills. - See? - Let me be. - Oh. thank God. - It's cooling down. - I'll be coughing all night. - Me too. Sounds like great fun. The chill of night is like murder with my rheumatism. I can't move. - I'll lose 40 pounds. - It's long past dinnertime. I don't see why Loli should wear evening dresses so young. - Nor do I. - She'll have to sooner or later. Mother. I'm going up to spy on the kids. Careful. dear. Now. Everyone. My goodness! - Oh. these children. - Genoveva is back. - Watch it. - They're catching pneumonia. I heard them shivering with cold, coughing and sneezing. At least two or three must be sick. One's got triple pneumonia! - My son! - My poor son with pneumonia. - It suits them right! - Shocking. The hunger and cold… of the enemy favors our victory. This way they'll surrender. Certainly not. I won't have my son falling ill over such nonsense. Quite humane. - Are you suggesting we surrender? - Naturally. enough of this nonsense. I hate to admit it. but they're not asking for anything unreasonable. Perhaps in your case. but my girl is defying my will. - Precisely. - Of course. For my part. I'll go negotiate and bring back my son. Me too. Just a moment. Only two skirmishes and you're ready to surrender? Haven't you ever heard of a mock attack? By dawn. our ranks will be weakened. Now victory is ours to win! Let's go. I think I hear footsteps. Light a rocket to see who's there. Here. They're coming to negotiate. Get up, they're coming to negotiate. - Who is it? - It's Mr. Cortina. Be prepared in case it's a trick. Bring more rockets. - He's very upset. - They know they're defeated. Let's see what he wants. - How can it be? - What's that? - You. in the enemy camp! - See? How did you like our projectiles? Deserter! How about the cover fire? We refuse to continue waging this merciless war. That's all. Our entire army suffers from gout and rheumatism. - What are your conditions? - First. that we won't be punished. - And that they won't ground us. - Or take away dessert. And especially that they won't force Loli to dress up. - They'll let her come play with us. - Very well. we accept. We'll see to it that the terms of the armistice are fulfilled. But as for you. I'll see that you're brought before a military tribunal. How about the pinecones? You like them? - Long live Mr. Amorós! - Hurrah! Come on. let's go! I'm always right. Germany— Afternoon. Without a doubt. Germany will win the war before winter. - General. that's pure— - General. I'll defer to the opinion of our victorious colleague. General Amorós. Do you share my view? Perhaps yes. perhaps no. Strategically speaking. as Von Clausewitz has said. a good deployment of force is always a good deployment of force. Very good. Yes. sir. Hello. - What a beautiful morning. - The sea is just gorgeous. Good morning. - He'll surely kill himself. - I think he does it to burn fat. - What a horror. - Look! Absolutely scandalous. Can you believe the nerve? What will become of this beach? - What a bathing suit! - You can almost see her knees. - It's so tight! - Among spies… But do you really believe that… - I told you. a Turkish spy. - What's she doing in Lindamar? She must be preparing a Turkish sea invasion. Your manner of dress is captivating. your charms. innumerable. Do not reproach me if my lips should finally utter this question. Will you be my wife. Genoveva? Ask for a token of my affection. Ask me for whatever you wish, Genoveva. Well. row out to that buoy. I'm so impatient. - Won't you advance me a kiss? - A kiss? How dare you! Wait here. Don't drown. I'll get the lifeguard. Who could that be? Hello! How nice. It looks like Juanito. Could it be Juanito? - Where's Genoveva? - No idea. - But she was with Renovales. - What bad manners. - What's wrong? - See him? They grabbed him by the neck. He can't wave. We'll complain. It's inconceivable. - This would never happen in the north. - Yes. dear. You're right. Next summer. San Sebastián. Come on, Loli. What's taking so long? Come on, let's play. - Look. a starfish. - Let's go play. It's starting to cool down. isn't it? I'm sure it's boiling in Madrid. How about some liquid refreshments? Vicente. when will you behave? The Kingdom of Montenegro. The Kingdom of Serbia. The Czarist Russian Empire. The Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. - Not a one. - What? Not a single one. I say. You know absolutely nothing. The Kingdom of Serbia no longer exists. nor the Kingdom of Montenegro. nor the Czar of Russia nor the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There's been a war. Mr. Garcia Hurtado. Don Enrique. It's already over. Didn't you know? - Well - - What did you do during vacation? You're dismissed. How'd it go. Enrique? What's wrong. tough exam? It's pouring. Get down from there. right this minute! You'll get it dirty. It's so pretty. What do you think. Kaiser? Do you like it? Tell me. Am I pretty? Thank you so much. I'm pretty. Why won't it stop raining? We can't go out. Say. Kaiser. I spent the summer with such a handsome boy. He's so nice. Want to know his name? You do? All right. Read it. Loli! Yes. Mother. THE END
