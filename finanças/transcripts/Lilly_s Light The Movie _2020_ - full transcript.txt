I didn't see you, my dear, I had numbers squarely rooted in my head. The readings I received were highly anomalous. Well, let me guess... treasure hunting again? Well, of course, but, I'm afraid my new underwater metal detector Is not optimally calibrated. It never occurred to me that in my search for metal under water I'd be snagged by lead sinkers. Perhaps you should stick to searching on land. You know, you could be right. I do apologize again for startling you. That's all right it wouldn't be the first time. Ah yes! If memory serves me, I was treasure hunting on the beach the day we first met. Ah. AAAAH! AAAAH! AAAAAH! That metal detector has continued to serve as my favorite invention to date. Well... until my latest, of course. The illuminating-imaginator! Is it finished? Oh, Max and the girls are going to be so excited! I was hoping to surprise them with a little demonstration tonight. Oh, Perfect. Until then... I will open my heart to someone new, today. How's the mirror? Can you see it, now? Perfectly, don't move, Lilly I see it, I see it. Wow, you were right, Max You can see Jupiter in daylight hours Look for the equatorial bands, Ashley Hey, Jupiter has a freckle on it. That's probably the great red spot, Katie Lynn. Am I right, Max?

Watch the leak. Will Patchitt Really? You think you can? Hi... I'm Lilly Ann Beacon. Will Patchitt Oh, that's great. It's going to be a really hard job ‘cause there's a leak over here and then there's another one over here, and... as far as I can see there's areally big one right there. I didn't get your name. Don't worry... Will Patchitt. That's wonderful. So, when can you start, Mr....uh... Mr...? The name is... Will Patchitt. Oh... . AAH!! How 'bout I startright now! ...and that's exactly how it happened! Ay yi yi It is! Checking for monsters, again? You don't understand, Max. What if I told you, I was afraid of monsters when I was your age, too. Get out of here! It's true. I even drew the scariest one on my computer. Wanna' see? That's not scary at all. Mine are real scary. Well, describe yours and I'll draw them. Okay. One's got these really huge bug eyes, a big nose... with bumps all over it. The other one's got this pointy chin with really sharp teeth and wolf ears. And they're both an ugly green color. How's that? Pretty close. They are kinda' scary. But, what if... every time you thought of them, they looked like this. They're not scary at all. If you get scared again, just remember.... you have the power to change the way you see things. A little lighthouse philosophy, huh, Max? You're very wise. Thanks, Max. Tikka tikka tikka So that's how Crum and Mudge came to be. Several years ago Katie Lynn's silly monsters. We sure have changed a lot since then. I can't wait to meet Max and Ashley! They'll be home for the holidays. I'm glad you're still here, Katie-Lynn! Me too, but I'll be off to college next year.

Hey, you know that boy? Daniel? Sure. I been looking for him He just left home a couple of days ago. His grandmother passed away. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, He doesn't have any other family. I been trying to get him up to Lilly's Foster home. Officer Newelly, I'm headed up there myself. I'd appreciate it if you'd let me take care of it. His grandmother was a friend of mine. Yeah? You got it. All right. Heh, heh, Glad to have you back on land. Thank You Heard you had a good catch. I did. See you later. Ok Hey Daniel, You hungry? Mmm Ladies... could you set another place at the table, please? Rah Rah Coo Coo Hey, the old bird works! I knew Will could patch it. Repairman extraordinaire Impressive. Oh, nothing to it. It was merely the sprocket spring needing some tinkering. Genius Whaaa Whoa...! Be careful! Whoa... whoa, whoa! He's gonna fall! Yeow! Watch out! Don't worry, he used to be a circus performer. Remember? Woah woah woah woah Woooo! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Bravo, Bravo How I do miss the smell of greasepaint. And elephant poop? But, I'd stay away from clock repair, if I were you. I agree. Sorry, Will. You better ask Professor Crabbe to tinker with this contraption. That's a good idea. A wacky clock might need a wacky inventor. But, you'll still be our repairman extraordinaire. Aw, shucks Heh heh. Well, catch you in a few, crew. Well, here... There you go. Bye, Thank You Oh! It's Peaches and Dee Dee and Peaches ... Oh...

Dee and Peaches! You're right! Knock, Knock Hi, Uncle Fitz! Wow! Fresh fish. Look at that! Welcome Back Thank You That is an enormous fish! Max, why don't you take the fish from Uncle Fitz? AAAGH I guess that you get to gut 'em. I decline the offer, thank you. Don't look at me. So, I take it you got my lunch invitation via carrier pelican. I sure did. Good A peligram from the infamous Pel Mel. By the way, I hope you don't mind, I invited someone else. Oh, I was hoping you would. All right. I'd like you all to meet... Hi Daniel. I'm Lilly. Nice to meet you. ...and that's Max and Ashley... Hi and Katie Lynn. Hi Hey How'd you know my... Come on in, you two. I hope you're hungry? Right Mmm, everything smells divine, Lilly, and we're starvin'. You certainly were out to sea for a long time, Uncle Fitz. That's the life of a fisherman. And I love it. Seems like a lot of strenuous physical activity if you ask me. Ya think? Well, It can be demanding on the body, but it sure feeds my soul and clears my mind. Does it ever make you seasick? The first couple of times my Pop took me out, but then I was a little tyke....like you. Well, looks like from the size of that catch you must have netted in a pretty big haul this time. The biggest ever. Being a fisherman sure sounds intriguing. Maybe that's the career for me. Hello! It's an outdoor life. Not what I would suggest for a computer nerd. Now, for me, it could be the ticket. I can see it, now. All hands on deck. Aye aye, Captain. Real cute, guys. Am I really that bossy? No comment. Max. Sometimes. But I'll still be your first mate. What about you, Daniel? Are you a fisherman, too? Nah. I grew up on a farm. Never had the chance to try it. Uncle Fitz can show you how. Uh huh He taught all of us. You might even acquire a taste for it. Well, in the mean time, I think Daniel could use some more Quay-sah-dillas, Uncle Fitz. It's a joke. So I'm confused... Whose uncle are you, anyways? He's..... everybody's. But not in a biological way. They adopted me. That's right. Except for Max and Ashley, we're all a little short on biological family around here. Well, I'd be, too... If I didn't have... a real abuelita What's that? That's spanish for grandmother, right? Yeah... It's just that..My grandma's... ...well, she's... Never mind. Is your farm around here? Yeah, it was, but I'm looking to move on. Well, Daniel, we hope you find what you're looking for. Now, who wants some homemade Peaches pie? Mmm No thanks, I'm on a budget. I mean a diet. Diet So, are you really the lighthouse keeper? Oh, I am ever since I restored this old place. But that's not all she does. Lilly and the kids get together and create marvelous storybooks based on their adventures. Mmm Hmm Adventures? What kind of adventures could you possibly find around here? Oh, you'd be surprised. With a little imagination... ...the possibilities are limitless. Can we show him, Lilly? Yeah! Why not?! Okay... Well, first, we start with an idea Any idea. And everyone's imagination adds to it.

Who's that? Do we wake him? Aw, hmm, umm.. Ah, Hello, Peasants! Hello Welcome to Hamelot! My name is Moylin. I am the Wizard of Hog. Pleased to meet you Moylin. I'm Li...... I once served the legendary King Arthog. I'm sure you've heard of him. There's a King Pig? Oh, that's dumb. Not in a pig kingdom! What? You've never heard of King Arthog and his Round Trough? King Arthur and the round table, maybe, but we're all a little in the dark on this one. Ah, you poor peasants... Well, allow me to enlighten you, my friends, Ha Ha You have just entered the land of a most noble king. My Royal subjects Oooh There was a time... not too long ago, when Hamelot was the place that every pig in the world wanted to be. It truly was... Hog Heaven! Aaah! We're all ears. Come on, don't leave us hangin'! Moylin. Moylin Oh, Moylin... MOYLIN! What? yes, yes, yes. Ahem, where was I? Hog Heaven. ...And it truly was. Yeah, right... King Arthog was married to the ...fair Lady Swine-avere Excuse me. Oh Nice! He built the finest pig kingdom in alF the land for her. Why, pigs came from all over the world... to feast on his famous Round Trough. Das hay is good, ya? Hay, This is for knights only, you Cochon! All knights to the jousting field. It IS the pig version of Camelot. Mmm Hmm Shhh! Just listen. Among his loyal subjects was a most trusted knight named, Sir Oinks-a-Lot. Sir Oinks-a-Lot, also being the m- Also being the m- handsomest knight in all the land Caused all the pig maidens to swoon. Unfortunately for the King, so did Lady Swine-avere. Sir Oinks-a-Lot, I Love You! Uh, oh. Wait for me! Don't go, my queen! She fell so madly in love with Sir Oinks-a-Lot, that she fled... I'm outta here. from the kingdom and has not returned ...to this day. Uh... what? Here you go. Ppffffffffff... Eww.. Uhhh Aww....Thank You. Oh, you keep it. Uhhhh Sir Oinks-a-Lot must have felt terrible. It wasn't his fault. You're right. He couldn't help his good looks, personality and charm, captivated the fair lady, ...but feeling responsible anyway he swore to use all his power to keep the King's spirits up. What'd he do? He took to the stage! Let's welcome, Sir Oinks-A-Lot Uh, uh Thank you. Now, Thank you. Now.... For my first joke, Why did it take the pig so many hours to cross the road? Why? Because he was a slow pork! Get it? Anybody? Is this thing on? Uh, Testing... Night after night he entertained the King with all his might. Know what you call a pig in a bathtub? Hog wash. What do you call a pig that does Karate? Pork Chop! He became the wittiest headliner at the palace. What do you call a giant hog with wings and yellow feathers? PIG BIRD Thank you very much. And why should you never tell a pig a secret? Why? Because they squeal! Sounds like a real "ham". Huh, now that's funny. I'd like to meet this Sir Oinks-a-lot? You can catch him at the castle. He's doing eight shows a day. Grueling. Not anymore! Well, Hello Dilly and Dally! I haven't seen you two since the King pulled the sword out of the stone. Sir Oinks-A-Lot has been banned from the castle! What? He's missing!!? And he's distraught! He's got no home now. Sounds like he's having a real identity crisis. But he's a star It happens to celebrities. Well... We want to help him. Then let's go find him. What does he look like? A pig... ...in shining armor. I think I saw him earlier. And he didn't seem very happy. You're right! I'm not. I think we found him. Oink! That's Sir Oinks-a-lot to you. Oh, Oh, Sir. I can't be a stand-up comedi-ham anymore! Oh, Sir, May we have your autograph? We're big fans, from Peasantville. Peasantville? What? Peasantville, it's a suburb of Hamelot. Oh! Ugh Oh, You have been our inspiration. Knock, knock.

He'll be back. Aahhh Sorry to be gone so long, Oink. You hungry? Try these. Quay-sa-dillas Yeah yeah... quesadillas, I know. They're not bad. I met some really interesting people today. They live up in the old lighthouse. It's pretty cool inside. They said I could stay there if I don't have a place to sleep. Don't worry. I'm not leaving you buddy. Besides, I don't want any new friends. Aw, great... I left my backpack up there. Better go and get it. I'll be right back, all right? I have to go. I have to go, I have to go. Here's a little something I crafted for the occasion. Friends together, friends apart, friends forever in the heart. Oh, it's so neat! Gee, I thought you made that for me. How could I, we're hardly ever apart. Hey, I thought .. how 'bout we hang it up on the wall? That's a great idea. Oh, don't worry about any supplies. We've got you covered. Oh, thanks, you two. I hope he'll like the surprise. I'm sure he will. See ya. Let's see, Professor Crabbe. Here you go, Max. At your request. All right! Thanks, professor. I have to say, it's my most ingenious invention yet. I call it... the Illuminating-Imaginator. Oh, cool. Fascinating... That's a long name. Could we call it the "Illiator" for short? I like the sound of that. The "Illiator". How's it work? Well, let's start with an image on your computer. Anything. How 'bout these? My silly monsters. Cute little curmudgeons. Perfect. What's a cu-jer-mudgeon? That's curmudgeon. And it usually means someone ill-tempered, crusty and... Oh... crabby! Oh. Good, now to download the images from the screen you press this button, here. ..and this button, here. The images are now transferred into the device and the fun begins. Brilliant! Oh, but there's more. I'll teach you how to operate it. ...but first, I promised Will I'd take a look at that old Cuckcoo clock. Oh yeah! That's right. Can you explain it to us while you work, Professor? Why not? Shall we? You must be the famous, Pel Mel. Nice to meet you. So, are you really a carrier pelican? Are you sending a Peligram? No, I, uh... I left my backpack here. Oh. Does he really deliver messages? Yeah. He's pretty amazing. Uh, you need to, uh, use the phone? You can always do that, you know. No, there's no point. Besides, I don't talk to that many people. Then, I'm honored. Well, I mean, I used to talk to my grandma. but, now that she's not here anymore... and, well, my other friends... I had to leave them behind. That must have been so hard for you, Daniel. Now you're on your own? You know, I grew up an orphan. So, I learned to make a family out of my friends. I think you'll find that you can make some new friends here, if you give 'em a chance. I don't want any new friends. The minute you love someone, either you lose them... or they lose you. That's a pretty tough philosophy to live by. Yeah, I'm used to it. Don't care, don't cry, don't feel, No shame. Courage.... is my middle name. Muy Bueno! You come up with that yourself? You know, Daniel, Circumstances are sometimes beyond your control. But nothing is beyond your heart. I know it took a lot of courage for you to say goodbye to someone you love. But it takes a lot more courage... ...to let yourself feel all the things life throws your way. Yeah, well... Thanks for the advice.. ...but this heart is beyond feeling. ♪♪ REACH FOR THE JOY BEHIND THE PAIN ♪♪ ♪♪AND LOOK FOR THE SUN BEHIND THE RAIN ♪♪ ♪♪ DON'T BE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU FEEL ♪♪ ♪♪ IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO CRY♪♪ ♪♪ SOON ENOUGH YOUR TEARS WILL DRY ♪♪ ♪♪ NOTHING IS BEYOND YOUR HEART♪♪ ♪♪ ANYTHING YOU DREAM CAN HAPPEN♪♪ ♪♪ DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE ♪♪ ♪♪ JUST AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE♪♪ ♪♪ STAY TRUE TO WHAT'S INSIDE OF YOU ♪♪ ♪♪ FIND THE COURAGE THERE ♪♪ ♪♪ AND ONCE YOU FEEL THE MAGIC START ♪♪ ♪♪ YOU'LL FIND NOTHING IS BEYOND YOUR HEART ♪♪ Can't do it, Lilly.

Do you think he'll like it? Yeah.... Shhh... it's a secret. Aye yi yi. What's all the ruckus? Maybe you should go check it out. Pel Mel, ole buddy... We did good. Raaahhh. You go girl! Here's the hammer, Will. Here he is. Oink! You're here! I can't believe it! Surprised? Yeah! Come here, Oink. How'd you know? A little birdy told me. Are we keeping him, Lilly? Uh, huh. Cool. Thanks, Lilly. You sure got a swell pig there. I know. Well, now that the secret's out, it's nice to meet you, Daniel. I'm.....Woah... Away he goes.... Here, little piggy. He's gone hog wild. Come back here, little piggy! Oink! He's going under the sink. Oops! Al Patchitt. No, Will Patchitt. That's funny. OInk. Come on out of there. Daniel, I'm Will Patchitt and this is my nephew... No, Let me guess. Al... Patchitt. Nice to meet you both. And Daniel, That would be Professor Crabbe. Oh, ho! Good job. Hey, Oink. It's good to see you again, amigo. I think you'll like it here. I've never seen hair like that on a farm pig. He's not a farm pig. He's a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig. Where'd you get him? Our neighbors owned him, but they had to move to the city and couldn't keep him. So, you adopted him. I guess you could say that. Oink's been Daniel's friend for a long time now. Yeah. And we thought pelicans were cool. Ha ha ha Has anyone seen my illiator? Nope. It'll turn up. Well, I think it's time for bed, everyone. Good night, Oink. Night. I thought you'd might like the top bunk since you're the oldest. Thanks, bro. Ready? Oopsie-daisy There we go. I'm glad Oink and Daniel are part of the family now. Me, too. Thank you for a wonderful day, today. And may your next adventure... Start in your dreams. Can you sing us a song, Lilly? - Please? - Yeah.

I'm all heart! Well, I'm all heart, Crum, but I'm not sure about you. Aww.... J.K. Don't worry Crum, you're all heart, too. Anybody home? I came by to fix the old telescope. We're down here, Will. There you are. HI. Got a hand? Hi. Who are you? I'm Kenny. Kenny's my cousin visiting from the mainland. Kenny Patchitt? Oh, yeah. I can, indeed. And guess what, crew... he loves to make music, just like you, Lilly. Nice. Oh, yeah. Any chance I get. It's lovely to meet you, Kenny. Welcome to Beacon's Bay. Thank you. Hey, did you find that old telescope? Not yet. But we found the Big Book of Little Adventures. Hey, did anybody else see that spark? Oh, yeah. It's the light of creativity. Oh.Okay. You'll get use to it. The lighthouse has a way of.... Shining a light on things? You took the words right outta my mouth... As usual. Well, maybe that's why they call it... A light-house! You're gonna fit right in here. Hey, whose guitars are these? They belong to Uncle Fitz and Daniel. But they're away having fish and chips. She means, on a fishing trip. When they're in town, we have a lighthouse jam. - Oh. - We sure do. You'll have to join us sometime. I'd love it. Do you play guitar, Kenny? Oh, I know a chord or two. Well, Charlie really wants to learn. Maybe we found him a tutor? I'd be honored. Yes. Hey, Crew! Look what I found! Yeah.....Woo hoo Yay! Will....Patchitt?? Yep! Sure will!! Lilly, which lens was not working? Imagination and power. That's the sky blue and the purple lens, Will! Ha ha! Wait a minute, Your telescope has multiple lenses? And they change color, too. The better to see things with, my dears. Are they rainbow colors? Like our beacon? Twelve, to be exact. Cool. Ha ha. You know... The colors of the rainbow are the basic spectrum From which all the light we see is composed. Cool. And it was the rainbow That inspired scientists to further explore the nature Of color and light. Drawing the conclusion- That color is connected to light. Glad I asked. Pretty sharp, huh? Oh, Yeah. I thought I was gonna be the tutor! So Charlie, let's see what you got. Awesome! Uncle Fitz showed me a C chord. All right! Nice. What's a chord? A chord is a... group of notes played together to form a harmony. Jinx!! Two peas in a pod. Jinx! Oh, I get it....like the colors that form a rainbow? I like the way you think, Jacara! If notes were colors, A group of notes would form a rainbow! Ha ha What colors are those, Mudge? All shades of green, Crum. You have a serious problem with your piping! I'm sorry, Kenny, meet the Curmudgeons. Hi. Hi. I should have made 'em pink. Mm hmm. Ok... uh... So can I show you a couple more chords, Charlie? You rock, Kenny! All right. - Yeah! I'll get the maracas! - Okay, play a C like this. I'll get the bongos. And then an F. Okay, try it. Heh heh heh Perfect. Let's go! Feels like a lighthouse jam to me! Hoo hoo hoo! Let's help 'em out, crew. Lovely.

Well, a "spark" is a driving force in some activity. It ignites, animates or inspires. Nice definition. So, there could be a spark of "light" in anything. There's a spark of light in every one of us.
