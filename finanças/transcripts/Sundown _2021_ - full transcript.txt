Wake up! - Come on! - Come on! There's no way he's gonna get in. It's not cold. She's looking at you. - She's not his type. - She could be my type. - She wasn't looking at you. - Could've been. - Mm. - Stop it. Hello. Good evening. These are our premium steaks for tonight. We have the 200 gram rib eye and the 400 gram cattle prod. I give you doubles. Ooh. - Mum? - Hmm? Joining in? - Uh... - There's only two of us playing. Come on. Just a sec. Just a sec. - Wait, wait. - Are you working? I am. - Get off your phone! - Just a... No... This is stupid. - No work. - I don't want to play. - Ten minutes, no work. - Why? I... This is the first time I took my phone, in a day. - Nearly. - Mm. Well, you're not getting it back. Not until you play. - Come on! - Are you playing? This has nothing to do with me. We're talking to you. - Come here. - Come on. - I never liked dominoes. - All right... - Come on, give me my phone. - We'll restart the game. - Pfft! - Come on! You want a picture? No, thank you.

We'll be there as soon as... Mum? We'll be there as soon as we can. Mum? - What's going on? - Uh, it's Mum. They're taking her to a hospital. Uh, start packing.

So, what's happened? I see. All right. No, I understand. I understand. Is she dead? - Thank you. - You're welcome, sir. Sir, we have sorted out your flights. Unfortunately, we couldn't avoid a layover in Mexico City and then one in Madrid. Thankfully, it's only one in Mexico. And only two hours in Madrid. We need your passports. Thank you. Can I have your passports, please? Thank you. Thank you. Have you given them your passport? - Yeah. - Okay. - I don't have my passport. - Mum...

We need your passport. - What did you say? - I don't have my passport. - What the fuck? You don't... - What? I left it at the hotel. Um... Okay, we can put you on the next flight. - Thank you. - No, no, no! We'll wait! - We have to go now. - We will wait! No! The plane is already boarding, okay? - I can't believe it! - Mum... Get her on the plane. We need to pass security. Mum, come on. How can you leave your passport? Come on. Fuck! We will follow your luggage, okay? We will wait for you. Come this way. Taxi? Hotel. What hotel? - Hotel. - Whatever? Okay. Hotel, very, very good. You like chicas? Table dance. Look at it. This is a beautiful girl. Hold on just a second. Luisa! Can I have a room, please? Yes. Hold on. You first see the room. - Want to show you? - Okay. Okay. - How much? - Four hundred pesos. Thank you. Okay. Amigo, if you need anything, you call me. This is my phone number. - Okay. - Okay? - Gracias. - Thank you. - Fine. - Okay. - You're only going to pay for what you drink, okay? - Okay. Anything else you need, let me know. Okay, thank you. Hang on, hang on. Hang on. Hi, how are you? Yeah. No, I'm... No, I looked in the safe. We looked in the safe. We... It's not there. I thought it was there, it's not there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, they're still looking. They're still looking. We're still looking. Yeah. No, I... I'm... I have to fix this at the consulate and, um... It's closed till Monday, so... I'm sorry. It's the best I could do. If they give you a new passport on Monday, you could fly back straight away. - Yeah. - You could arrive on Tuesday, and we could have, uh, the funeral on Wednesday. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully, yeah. Or maybe you could get an emergency permit to fly, something like that. Yeah, well, I'll try my best. I'm going to have Richard e-mail the death certificate. Get things going, you know? Okay, yeah. Where are you? Um, I'm at a hotel by the consulate. How safe is it there? Oh, it's fine, don't worry. Yeah. Hang in there. I will. How are you and the kids? Uh... We just can't believe she's gone. Yeah, no, I know. I know. Nor can I. Right. We're on the next flight. Okay. Bye. Bye, love. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Everything good? Hey, what's up? My friend. My friend. Hi. Oh, man... - Your hotel very good? - Yeah. - You like there? - Yes. Okay. All right. It's... a nice day, right? Hmm? Uh... No. You want me to open? - Okay. - Yeah. Thank you. - Aqui. - Gracias. - Vacation? - Mm-hmm. Yes. Where are you... where are you from? London. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. Mm. Berenice. Is where you're from? Okay. Neil. She's Jenny. - You want to see? - Yeah. I'm with Richard, going through the funeral arrangements. Richard is going to send you the death certificate and other documents... to take them to the consulate. And if they don't attend to you, then just give him a call. I need you to help me make some decisions. Sorry. - My friend... - No, it's fine. - Drunk. - You wanna sit? - Yeah. - Okay. Hello. Hi. Hi, sweetheart. No, no, no, I'm just grabbing a quick bite, but, um... I know it's urgent. I'm... just by the consulate, but... Yeah, I'll be... I'll be... there as soon as possible. I know, and I do. I wanna come home, too, of course I do, but... She told you that? She told you she wanted to be cremated? Well, they're not family, so, it's got nothing to do with them. So, whatever you choose to do, I'm with you. Whatever you feel. Yup. Absolutely. You sound awful. - Salud! Salud! Salud! - Cheers. What's going on? Could you answer the fucking phone? I need you. Where's my stuff? Where's my... I don't know. So, you should go there. You should go to Paris. - Mm-hmm. - Go to London, where I'm from. Uh, Rome. Beautiful! Rome. Uh, yeah, you should go there. Mm-hmm. Mm... You... no woman? No. - Wife? - No. You? Do you have a partner? Do you have a husband? - No. - No? - No, no. No husband. - Mm-hmm. Do you have children? No, no children! Okay. - You? - No. I have, uh, a niece. And, uh, my sister's children. My sister has a niece and a nephew. That's what we call... we call... And I love them. I love them very, very much. - But no, none. - No. Okay. Bye-bye! - Bye! - Gracias. - Gracias. What the fuck is going on? I've been calling and calling. I thought you needed help. I... I was really worried. What are you doing? Do you realize what I had to go through? The funeral... the people... and all that on my own! What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I come and see you? - I'll wait here. - Okay. - Welcome one more time. - Thanks. - Can I have a buggy? - Okay. - Alice Bennett. - Okay. Okay, let's go. I thought you weren't going to come. Why? For the same reason you left me with all of our problems. The fact that you've been hiding. I'm not hiding. You never came back for your passport. You never went to the consulate. Did you even lose your passport? Mm-mm. What do you want? Do you want... do you want our money? Do you want my money? Is that why you're doing this? No. Then why are you doing this? I'm not interested in money. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Don't you want to see the children? Yeah, of course I do. Yeah. When? I don't know. Well, then, just come home! If you want me to give up my share, I'll do it. Just have Richard sign... Send the papers, I'll sign them. I'll sign anything. Okay? Yes, Richard? Um... Richard says that, um, if you're willing to sign, he can be here, prepare the paperwork and come. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Shall we have dinner? What? Are you hungry? Just fuck off! Hi, Richard. No, I'm... I'm fine. Go ahead. When's the reading? Okay, well, um... You're representing me, you'll be there for me, I'm... I'm not interested in the money, Richard. The money is hers. Yeah. No, I... I know, but it's... it's... The business is hers, she's always... she's always run the business. It's for her to... her to decide. - You wait here? - Okay, Neil. - Hi, Richard. - Good to see you. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm fine. - Thanks for coming. - Shall we sign? We have to be at the airport in 40 minutes. You leave today? I thought you'd be with us two weeks ago. Neil... you do realize that in signing this, you are relinquishing everything. Your sister is granting you a monthly stipend, but it's on condition that you maintain monthly contact with the family, through me. All right, so... What sum should I write in? Ten thousand a month? He'll live nicely on that in Acapulco. Ten thousand. Will you come back with us? May I sign? Yes. Here. And there. Uh, I'll wait in the van. Thanks, Richard. There. And here. Call an ambulance! Remember the guy who came to get beers? We went to eat something afterwards. Albert Thompson from the consulate. Okay. Where's Berenice? I'm not sure. Why am I here? Oh, um... - You don't know? - No. "Today, the British Embassy in Mexico confirmed "the crude assassination of Alice Bennett, "heiress of the multi-billion pound swine production "and slaughterhouse business in the U.K., "who was killed in a kidnapping attempt in Acapulco, Mexico. "Brother, Neil Bennett, was seen on numerous occasions with killers, "Guerrero and Anderson, found at the scene. "But their getaway driver, Jorge Saldana, better known as Jorge Campos, "was located several hours later by authorities." Where's Richard? Heard they wouldn't let him in. My sister has children... Richard has spoken to them, but I'm not sure that... I saw the documents that you signed. The ones leaving your share of the inheritance to your sister. You two being the sole heirs of the fortune made from the slaughterhouses and the pig production businesses... - and the... - I need to talk to Richard. - He's looking for a lawyer. - He's a fucking lawyer! A Mexican lawyer. Why didn't you go home for your mother's funeral? The embassy has requested you are placed in your own cell, and they are requesting the presence of a legal team in London in order to get you out of here. How long are you staying? Until you're released. We've got a very good lawyer coming from Mexico City. How are they doing? Colin's very perturbed. Alexa won't answer my calls. It's very messy, Neil. Why were you staying at that hotel? Were you involved with anything? I mean... Excuse me. Will you just give us a minute? I've actually been instructed by the consulate not to leave you two alone, sir. I'll be leaving with you in a minute. I'll see you outside. How are you feeling? If... if we explain... your condition... How are they? How are they really? Gracias. No. Tell me when. Oh, hang on, hang on. Hang on. To the airport. Thank you. Will you take me to the hotel? Hola. - Hi. - Hey. The kids are here. They need to talk to you. What the fuck? I'm sorry, love. - It's okay. - You're not sorry! You're not... What the fuck! Wait! Just wait there! Get out... Neil? Just go. Go, go, go. Go. Go to them. Go. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Yes? Hi. The family business will become yours... Colin and Alexa. All of the banking, the properties... the business outlets, the farms, everything. Neil will continue to receive his lifetime pension... which your mother had agreed to. He will also receive £100,000 as a down payment. And his health insurance will be paid for his lifetime. Can we sign? Yes. Just sign and then just pass it. Are we done? Wait a moment. We're done. Come on, Alexa. Neil? Hey! Hey! Neil? Neil? We want to transfer you to Oncology Center in Mexico City, okay? Excuse me. I compared your medical records that your insurance company sent to us with the test that we just ran. The cancer had already metastasized. We found a new growth in your frontal lobe. So, I recommend we start chemotherapy right away.
