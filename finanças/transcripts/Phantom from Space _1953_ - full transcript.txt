[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: This is Washington, DC, and in the files of the Central Bureau, there is a story so strange in its implications that it defies ordinary classification. It is a story of a handful of people who in the course of one desperate night held back a wave of panic and pandemonium. It began after sundown. Time, 7:15 as Flight A post-patroled from Travis Field was returning to base when the nightly Air Force transport pointed north toward Japan via the great circle route. While at see, the Navy and Coast Guard maintained their usual around the clock vigil. And from the equator to the Arctic, the radar network swept the skies with eyes that never sleep. Time, 7:19 an unidentified object was picked up 200 mile southwest of Port Barrow, Alaska. 7:27, unidentified object confirmed at Fairbanks, Alaska, heading south, southeast 170 degrees. Height, 75,000 feet. Estimated speed, 5,000 miles per hour. White warning. 7:39, unidentified object 200 miles due west of Vancouver, British Columbia. Course 170 degrees, height 60,000, estimated speed down to 3,600 miles per hour. Yellow warning. 7:54, first interceptor flight airborne. Point of interception, 80 miles due west of San Francisco, California. 7:55, unidentified object past point of interception. Red warning. 8:11, Morro Bay, California. Height, 50,000 feet. Estimated speed, 2,000 miles per house. 8:15, Santa Monica, California. Height, 10,000 feet. Speed, 1,200 miles per hour. 8:18, all traces of unidentified object gone. Red warning lifted. By 8:25 at the Los Angeles branch of the Communications Commission, reports of strong interference with radio and television reception began to pour in from the beach area. Monitors went to work immediately. Mobile units were ordered to converge on the vicinity of the disturbance. Pin point direction finding devices began to trace the trouble to its source. -This is mobile one, Hazen speaking. We're at Ocean and Beacon Way, an apparent strength two, bearing 27 degrees. Over -Mobile one from center, roger. Over. -Mobile center from mobile seven, over. -Go ahead mobile seven. -This is mobile seven. We're at pacific center in beach four, interference strength three, bearing 39 degrees, over. -This is mobile center, roger. Stand by. Mobile one and mobile seven from mobile center, point of interception estimated three miles of surf. Repeat, three miles north of surf. Acknowledge. -This is mobile seven, roger. -Mobile one, roger. -Mobile seven, roger. We're going out. MAN (ON RADIO): OK, Charlie, let's get moving. -Yes, what is it? -Excuse me. Do you have a phone? I need an ambulance. -What's the matter? -My husband and Pete, out there in the picnic grounds just above the beach. They've been hurt. -Well, this is a communications car. I'll phone it in from here. Mobile one to central, over. You make that out, Charlie? CHARLIE (ON RADIO): Not a word. -Mobile one to central, I can't reach you. Repeat. [BEEP] Well, it must be getting us all right. Mobile one to central, have an ambulance sent to beach at surf. Emergency, two men hurt. Acknowledge. [RADIO SOUNDS] -Roger and out. I'm sure they'll be here soon now. Tell us what happened. -Oh, this man, he just kept coming at us. It was awful. -Who? -I don't know. He was wearing a suit like a diver. Hurry please. They're hurt. -Charlie, you better wait here. I'll go down and take a look. NARRATOR: A young woman's hysteria became obvious once as they reached the picnic grounds of the beach. There was no sign of the mysterious intruder. And little could be done for her husband and their friend until the ambulance arrive. -Hi, fellas. -How are you doing? -Oh, we're just taking another reading now. What happened down there? -The police took the girl and one of the guys to the station. -What about the other one? -Oh, he's on the way to the morgue. That was her husband. -You're right on the button, Charlie, 44.7. Report back to central if you find anything else. -Charlie, grab that portable [INAUDIBLE]. -Got it right here. -I'll pick you up right here in about an hour. -Where you going? -Police asked me to drop by the station, sign a report. I'll see you later. -If you don't, you know where to look for the body. -Like I said, we were just starting to eat and we heard something tracking through the sand toward us. I looked up and couldn't see anything. Then Betty screamed. -At what? I thought you couldn't see anything. -At first we couldn't. And this guy started toward us. -What kind of a guy? -How should I know? He was wearing some kind of a helmet over his head. He could've been a deep sea diver or anything. -All right, after you saw this diver, what happened? -Well, we jumped up. Ed-- that was Betty's husband-- yelled at him to stop. But he just kept coming. I never saw anything like it. He didn't say anything. He just kept moving in. -And then you say he attacked you. -I wouldn't even give him a chance. Ed grabbed a piece of wood and took a swing at him. That didn't stop him. He caught the end. That's-- that's all I remember. -Just because a man's taking a walk is no reason to slug him. Besides, you don't look like a guy who frightens so easy. -How would you feel if somebody with a crazy helmet with pipes sticking out of it came at you in the dark. Look, I know this sounds crazy, but there wasn't any head in that helmet. -No head. No head at all? -It's the truth. -I think you need some coffee. -I don't want anything. -If it's all the same to you, leiutenant, I've got to pick up one of my men at the beach. -OK, that's for coming down, Hazen. Hope I didn't put you out. -No troubles. So long. To you too. -All right, let's start at the beginning. How well did you know the dead man? And his wife? -Betty and I went to school together. I knew Eddie a year. -How long were they married? -About a year. -Wasn't her husband a little older than she? -I don't know. -But you said you and Mrs. Evans went to school together. And you never discussed anything personal with her? -She did mention he was older, yes. -How much? -15, 20 years. What difference does that make? -That wasn't too hard now was it? Where do you live? 629 1/2 East Palm Court. Why? -That's where the Evans live, isn't it? -Yeah, I board with them. -You do, eh? Now Mrs. Evans is a good-looking woman. -What are you trying to say? [PHONE RINGING] -Lieutenant Bowers. Where? Yeah, I got it. I'll leave right away. There's been another murder. Near the beach. Keep an eye on this guy till I get back. -What are you-- -You'll stay right where you are, at least until Mrs. Evans feels well enough to talk. -What do you want from her? -Oh, I just want to see if your story checks with hers. After all, you went to school together, remember? [SIRENS] -You say there were no witnesses, huh? -None yet. -Anything missing? -I don't think so. The cash register wasn't touched. -Get a breakdown of the inventory as soon as you can. What about finger prints? -Boys are working on them now. -Sorry I'm late. -What kept you so long? -Lieutenant asked me to hang around a while. -What's the score? -Eh, it looks like one of those things-- pretty girl, loner husband, young boarder. Kid claims some guy without a head knocked the old man off. -You don't say. Anything else? -Yeah, he had a diver's outfit with horns. -No. He's gonna have to do better than that. -How are we doing? -I took a reading about 10 minutes ago. The radiation has gone out out with the tide. What about the radio phone? -It's working fine again. I just got a call from central. They said mobile seven picked up some new trouble northeast of here. -Here we go again. -Hop in. -Who reported this murder? -There he is there. Lives next door. His name's George Nelson. -Hey, Mr. Nelson. -Yes, sir. -Come here, will ya? I'm Lieutenant Bowers, homicide. You found this body? -That's right. He must have just locked up for the night when this happened. -How do you know that? -Well, he usually does around this time. -What were you doing here? -I was sitting at home watching the fights on TV, and all of a sudden the thing started acting up. -What has that got to do with it? -Of course, you don't know the set. You know, it wouldn't work at all when I came home to supper. And all of a sudden, it cleared up fine. So I thought, well, I'll just stop to look at the fights again. And all of a sudden, out it goes again. So I thought maybe the battery station down here was overcharging the circuit and so I just got to take a look. That's all. -Hey, don't you ever quit work? What's up this time? -Another murder. What are you doing here, Hazen? -Same as before. Still trying to track down that signal. -Hey, uh, does that stuff work on TV too? -It has been for hours. -What'd I tell ya? -What's the matter? -It seems his set went on the blank. -Well, at least we know we're on the right track. How'd you make out with that boarder? --[LAUGHS] He's still sticking with the story. The guy had no head. -Well, I'll be seeing you. So long. -Right. NARRATOR: And so the communications team resumed its mission, to track the mysterious interference to its source. Via accurate readings taken at regular intervals by stationary and mobile units, it was determined that the disturbance was moving in a north-easterly direction. By 10:34, mobile center had pinpointed the disturbance at the edge at the Huntington Oil Fields. Units one and seven were instructed to close in. -Hey, Charlie. Do you see what I see? -Yeah. The oil field. -Let's So our trouble's burning up. -Well, there's only one way to find out. -Look, serg, to murders and an explosion in one precinct is big news. Now come on, you can't pit it all on the young boarder. Or can ya? -Very funny. Yeah? -I'm Hazen of the Communications Commission. -Oh, the lieutenant's waiting for you. -Thank you. -Who's the [INAUDIBLE]? -You heard the man, Communications Commission. -So does this kind of interference happen very often? -Never anything like this. It's on the move all the time. --[INAUDIBLE] transmitter wouldn't occur. -It's not a transmitter. We don't get a definite disturbance, just an appearance. -Hmm. You have no idea of what it is, huh? -Not yet. How are you making up? -Not so good. You were here when I questioned that boarder about the murder at the beach. -Get any more about of it? -Yeah, come on with me. You might want to see this. Ah, I see you're just about done. Thanks, you can go now. Are you sure this is what the man looks like? -What do you say, Betty? -Well, just about-- um, I think the tubes were a little lower down. -And you still insist there was no head inside the helmet. -I'm positive there wasn't. -What about you? -Well, it was dark. I couldn't swear to it. -Thanks, that'll be all. -You mean we can go now? -Yeah, for the time being. Just stick close to home. I'll be wanting to see you again tomorrow. -We'll be there. Come on, Betty. -Kind of changed your mind about those two, haven't you? -Yeah, I guess I have. Hey, Lou, bring in the old man, will ya? -Don't tell me you believe this story about this-- this-- whatever it is. -I know it sounds as phony as it ever did. But-- Sit down, will you, please? You're the watchman at the Huntington Oil Fields. -Oh, yes, sir, I've been with the company for over 22 years. -Sit down. Will you tell Mr. Hazen here exactly what happened? -Well, sir, like I said before, I was just closing the gate for the night when I saw this fellow coming up. I was never so scared in my life. -Yes, go on. -Well, it wasn't the man so much as the suit he was wearing. Oh, he wouldn't stop when I hollered at him. He just pushed him way right in there through the gate and walked right up those steps. -Well, you carry a gun. Did you try to stop him? -It was much too close to a tank. I was afraid to shoot. So I thought I might call for help. Just as I got to the shack, the tank blew up. Oh, you should see the sight. The-- -Uh, sir, could you give us a description of this man? How would you say he was dressed? -Well, sir, like I said before, he wore a sort of-- the sort of [INAUDIBLE] not outfit with a helmet attached to it. -How tall was he? -Oh, he was a giant of a man. And he had tubes sticking out of that thingy, that helmet he wore. -Uh, could you tell us what his face looked like? -Huh, well sir. Though he got pretty close to me, I could swear the man had no face. -Now if you saw this man again, would you recognize him, I mean by his outfit? -I'll never forget that sight if I live to be 100, sir. -Would you say this is the man? -Why, sure. That-- that's him! -Thank you very much. You may go now. -Oh, that's it. -Well, Hazen. What do you say now? -Beats me. The descriptions check all right. This could be some kind of flying suit, high altitude equipment. -Yeah, that's what I've been thinking. But how do you explain that stuff about the missing head? -Naw, we can just [INAUDIBLE]. These people were frightened. It's night. Nobody really took a close a look at him. -I guess you're right. But whoever he is, that outfit doesn't look like one of ours. -Of course, he could've been dropped by a parachute. -Sabotage? -I think we better wire a report to Washington, see what they say. -Yeah, you can use our teletype. I'll tip off the LA police to be on the look out for something unusual. -Hey, wait a minute. What about the press? -Oh, I don't think they know too much now. -You better keep it that way for a while, at least, till we find out whether our friend is still around here. -Well, if he is, I think we can find him for you. My hunch is that he's carrying something around that's causing all this disturbance, whether he knows it or not. -Yeah. Kill that page one lead. They let the boarder and the girl go. Hmm? How do I know? The lieutenant thinks that a guy in a flying suit knocked off the husband. Mhm. Nah. No, not a chance. Not a chance of an exclusive run of the picture. They're making a blanket release in the morning. Hm? Oh, there's a guy from the Communications Commission now. Yeah, I'll call you back later if there's anything new. OK. [KNOCKING] -Come in. -Sorry to interrupt you, Lieutenant. -No, what is it, Jim? -This teletype came for you. -Oh, thanks Jim. I'm waiting for it. That was fast. Well, here's our answer. -Looks like they never sleep in Washington. -Just a contact of Major Andrews, care of Dr. Wyatt, director of the Griffith Institute. -It's kind of late. Well, I'll give them a call. -While you're at it, I'll go out to the car check with central. -OK. -Well, that's the story up till now. We got in touch with Washington. They told us to contact you here. -Very interesting. What do you think, doctor? -When I see something like this, I understand why your gentlemen might have thought [INAUDIBLE] was involved. -Lieutenant, are you sure there were no traces of this saboteur, this ex-man found after the explosion in the oil field? -Fire department went over ever inch of the area. Didn't come up with a thing. -Well, then there's a strong possibility that he might have perished in the explosion itself. -I doubt that . We're pretty well-convinced this man is carrying something that's responsible for all the signal interference. According to the last report I got, there was a death in the disturbance about three miles east of the oil fields, sometime after the explosion. -Well, then if he's alive, you should be able to keep an accurate check of his where abouts. -Not that easy. As a matter of fact, we lost contact about three quarters of an hour ago. -Maybe he realized you were trailing him and got rid of whatever he had that was causing the disturbance. -I that case, there's nothing much my department can do to help you. -I guess it's up to us. Unless you have some suggestions. -Well, let me think out loud for a minute. It might just be that we've been talking about so far, and this [INAUDIBLE] we'll call him, ties in with what the doctor and I have been discussing. -That is very possible. -I don't whether you know it or not, but somewhere around 7:30 this evening, our radar networks picked up an unidentified object off Point Barrow, Alaska. They traced it clear down to Santa Monica before they lost it. -Santa Monica, that's what we first picked up our radio interference. -Yeah, right at the scene of the murder. -Well then, if all these things tally up, we've got some idea of how our men got here. -You mean that he came in some plane? In that case, somebody would have seen it land and take off again. -Well, when did it crash? -No, no we don't think it was a plane. No rocket or jet that has been built so far can obtain the speeds of 5,000 miles an hour, particularly for such a great distance. -Maybe we're on the wrong track altogether. Couldn't your unidentified object have been a meteor? They travel at a terrific speed. -Yes, fast enough for most of them to burn themselves out the moment they hit the earth's atmosphere. And did it occur to you that meteors are not very likely to travel horizontally, all the way from the North Pole to California? -If it wasn't a meteor or a flying missile of some type, what do you figure this [INAUDIBLE]. -We're not sure that he does. -I don't care what you say. But it doesn't make sense to me. Anybody trained in sabotage would stay undercover. This guy's walking around in a monkey suit, killing people. [KNOCKING] -Excuse me, Dr. Wyatt. Is there a Lieutenant Bowers in here. -Oh yes, what is it? -There's a Mr. Wakeman from the Chronicle here to see you. -Wakeman here? Now what does he want? -Well, there's only one way to find out. -Before you go, Lieutenant, I don't believe you've met my assistant, Barbara Randall. -Well, hello. -Hello. -It's Mrs. Randall, Lieutenant. -I'll be right back. -Barbara, you know the major. -Of course. -And this is-- -Hazen with the Communications Commission. -How do you do? -Well, I see you're working a little later tonight than usual. -Yes, my husband's teaching a late class, and he won't be able to pick me up for a while. Besides, I had some work to do in the lab. -Well, at least you'll have lots of company. -All right, so I shouldn't have come up here. But I've got to get you a rangle on this beach murder. And your whole department is shut up. -Look, Wakeman, would you stop bothering me? There's nothing to say. You come to exclusive stories and [INAUDIBLE], but you know as much as I do. -Yeah, but that still doesn't explain anything about the guy without a head. Come on. Who is he? -Your guess is as good as mine. -Do you mean you let those two kids go without knowing that? I don't buy it. -Well, I did. -Well then you must have an awful good reason. I bet you're trying to tie it in with that other murder. All right, Lieutenant. Don't tell me. I'll get my story somehow. Oh, if you want to know how things turn out, read the Chronicle in the morning. -That's right. I'll get in touch with Charlie in mobile one and have him call for me here. OK, honey. -Folks come up with anything? -No, we're just [INAUDIBLE] Barbara here. -It's just amazing the way you've been able to put these things together. -Don't kid yourself Mrs. Randall. It seems the press knows as much about it as we do. -Well, let's hope they don't come to the same conclusions. A few lurid headlines and every fool in the country will be seeing phantoms in space suits and men from Mars all over the place. -Yes. I can imagine. And mass hysteria is difficult to check once it gets started. -That's why we've got to move fast. -Well, from the looks of things, I guess it's up to me. I'll be in touch with you as soon as [INAUDIBLE]. See you. NARRATOR: By 12:30 AM, the dragnet was in operation. Mobile units patrolled the streets and countryside. The covered an area 35 miles square. Special and sensitive equipment was prepared for action. Everyone on the job was ready to move on the first signal from the Communications Commission. MAN (ON RADIO): Monitor Corona, the mobile centers. Strength four. Brickyard at 160th, moving toward oil fields. Contact your units. Over and out. -Units one, seven from mobile center. Units one and seven from mobile center. Strength four interference at 160th and the oil field. Moving due east. Close in. Repeating, strength four, interference at 160th and the oil field. Close in. [SIRENS] -[INAUDIBLE] Joe. -Just got here. Trying to set this up. -What gives, Hazen. -He's in this area, all right. -I [INAUDIBLE]. -Thank you, doctor. -I'll walk over to those oil fields. -Well, it doesn't register as far as the oil fields. -I think we'll do better if we split up. -Right, Lieutenant. You two go that way. Lieutenant, out here. Rick, Joe, you follow him. -Come on, doctor. And you, oh, forget it. -Hey, Hazen. Look at this. -Yeah. It points this way. Hey, Joe! Joe! -Hazen! Hey, Hazen! 603. -Boy, he's strong. -That's it, doctor. -It's leading this way. Come on! What's this way? Come on. -Going strong. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Checks with me. -Sure does. He's here. We saw him. -There he goes! -Come on! -[INAUDIBLE]. -He's got to be around here somewhere. -Yeah, how we gonna get on the roof? -Fritz, go get a ladder. [YELLING] -Let's cut him off! -Come on! -Anybody see him? -There he is! -Set him down. -We'll give you 10 seconds to come out of there, starting now! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10! We're going in. -A couple of you guys cover the door. Come on. -Ay, there's nobody in here. -Impossible, we saw him come in. -Maybe he went out of the window. -He won't get very far. -Don't touch anything till we check for finger prints. -Oh, doctor, over here. He left his suit and his helmet. -Hey, let's bring that thing out so I can get a good shot of it. -No way, you fool! -What's the matter? -For your information, that's a Geiger counter, and it says hands off. -I think you better wait outside. -I just have a job to do. -So do we. And I'm afraid ours will have to come first. -There's no radiation from the helmet. -But look at this! -So that's what's been causing all the trouble. Charlie, you know where we can dig up a lead line box in a hurry? -Well, mobile seven should have one. They're right outside. I'll take a look. -Hurry it up, will ya? -Unbelievable. Now we all thought that this phantom might be getting some device that's causing all the signal interference. [INAUDIBLE] had it due to the very clothes on his body. -That's not the only thing that bothers me. Did any of you get a good look at his face? -Not me. He's too far away. -Well, I did. Unless I'm mistaken, that helmet was empty. -Hey, where am I gonna put this stuff? -Oh, put it in Dr. Wyatt's station wagon. -You want me to take it back to the institute? -Right. -[INAUDIBLE]. -No, that's all right. You can handle that. -Any luck? -Not a sign of him. The boys are still searching the grounds. -For what? Nobody knows what he looks like without that outfit. -[INAUDIBLE] major. Reporter got a flash picture, and I just happen to borrow that film. It's on its way to head quarters right now to developed. -Good. Send us a print as soon as you can. -Sure. -Lieutenant, are you sure you don't want to come with us? We want to make a few tests at the lab. -I'd liked to, doctor. But you know the situation. I've got to get that guy. Let me know how you make out, will you? -Yeah, we'll do that, sure. -Good evening, doctor. We were just on our way home, and we saw you drive in. -Good evening, Barbara. -Hello, Bill. -I see we got here just in time. -Anything new? -Lots of excitement, but that's all. Major, you know Barbara's husband. -Oh, of course. How are you? -How are you. There, it's a nice looking dog you've got there. What's his name? -His name, Venus. -Say, Bill, I hate to ask this, but something important has come up. And I wonder, can we borrow Barbara for about an hour or so? -Hm. I suppose so. -Of course. Darling, why don't you go and do the shopping? Here's the list. The market's open all evening. -I may as well. See you later, honey. [BARKING] -I'll take the dog and tie her up. -Thank you Bill, goodnight. -Goodnight. -I'll give you a hand with this. -Oh, thanks, doc. Easy now. Look out for your fingers. -I've got it. Now don't drop it. -Venus, come back here! Venus, come back here! [BARKING] -What's the matter? There's no one in there. Come on. See, Venus, look, there's no one in here. You know you're not allowed in here. [BARKING] Venus, I said be quiet. Come on, girl. Now you stay right here, Venus. And I don't want to hear one sound out of you. -You were right, doctor. There are no finger prints anywhere. -What's all this? -Hey, don't touch anything. -You better put some gloves on. Our friend Mr. X left this suit at the oil refinery. -You mean you were that close to him and you didn't catch him? -I'm afraid so. That's up to the police now. Hand me those sheers. I want to cut this material to work with it. Say, better have those sharpened. -But I just bought them. -Well then. -Here, try this knife. -That still won't cut. -Let me try. This stuff is tougher than nylon. Why don't I try it over a Bunsen burner. It doesn't burn either. Let's take a look at it under the microscope. -Look, it's magnetic! -Magnetic? -Here I'll-- -Radioactive, and apparently indestructible. -Thank you. -What's the matter? -You tell me. Take a look at that weave. -What weave? There is none. This material is one solid mass. -Mass, yes. Why, you're right. It must be some sort of plastic. -No, I'd say it's a metallic substance of some kind. -Well, I've seen a lot of interesting alloys, but never anything like this. Let's try an acid test. -All right. -Go ahead. Careful now. It'll only take a drop or two -It repels acid like a raincoat repels water. -Why, there's no reaction. -Well, major, this looks as though we're going to be here for a long time. Now we have it. The helmet is not radioactive. The suit it. There's no doubt. This space suit is conditioned to function above 63,000. But human blood would boil, resulting in the body expanding to twice its size and death, of course. -I know. And it must withstand pressure and counter-pressure. Also it must be so supercharged it can function in atmosphere. -Now let's see what is left in this breathing apparatus. -Well, how are you doing? -The gas in the helmet tank breaks down to 11% methane. -Ordinary [INAUDIBLE]. What's the rest of the formula? -Well, that's where I'm stuck. I can't figure it out. It just doesn't respond to any of the usual tests. -Well, how could anyone exist on that combination of gases? You and I couldn't. But apparently someone can. -Doctor, are you trying to say that our X man doesn't breathe oxygen and hasn't the metabolism of a normal human? -I really don't know! From what we've seen, yes, some physical characteristics make him appear human. But added to them is this fabulous radio activity that none of us could stand. I am puzzled! -I think the answer lies right here in this helmet. Obviously he needs it to supply him, otherwise he wouldn't have risked wearing it where he'd sort of be recognized. As it is, he only took it off when he was cornered. -Well, if what you say is true, how can he exist without it now? -Let me put it this way, it's like a patient in an iron lung. Sometimes one can be removed for hours at a time without any real effects. -Exactly. And I think the same principle applies here. And that means sooner or later, he has to get his breathing apparatus back or die. -I don't understand it. -Well, I've got an idea. If we were to return this whole outfit to where he left it, he might be tempted to come back to it. [PHONE RINGING] -Dr. Wyatt speaking. Yes, he's here. -Oh, thank you. -Hello, major. Still at it, huh? -Mhm. -No, we haven't got a thing, no. The picture? -Yeah, hold on. He says the picture the reporter took of our man didn't come out. -I was afraid of something like that. The radio activity must have thrown the emulsion. -Hello. No, no we didn't find any fingerprints at all in his clothes. Did you find any? [BUZZ] Too bad. -Hello? Will you wait there please. -We don't know what to make of this either. Have you heard from the communication boys yet? Well let's hope they turn up with something. -Major, excuse me. -Hold on a second. Yes? -It's Mr. Wakeman of the Chronicle. He insists upon seeing you. -He does? Where is he? -I told him to wait in the lobby. -Good. Hello? Yes, our friend from the press is here. Don't worry. I wouldn't dare let anyone in on anything, at least not till we get something concrete. Right. All right, I'll see you later. Well, I guess I'd better see this newspaper man. Want to come along, doctor? -I think I will. -Well, hello. Remember me? -Certainly, yes. -Nice [INAUDIBLE] gadgets you've got here. -We think so. What's on your mind? -Well, I was wondering if you might let me take a couple of pictures of that suit you brought up here. -I'm sorry. We can't do that. -Oh. Well, now look, I've got a wonderful picture of the guy running into the shack. And the lieutenant stuck his nose in my business and what do I get? A blank. -Is that you, doctor? -Oh, you must have some lead on this guy, otherwise you wouldn't have brought that suit up here. -Well, let's just say we were curious. -Hello, Bill. Back so soon? -Isn't Barbara through? -I don't know. She's still in the lab. Why don't you go up and see? -Thanks. I will. Barbara! Barbara, are you in there? -Bill. Listen to me. I'm not alone. Someone is in here with me. I can't see him. He locked the door and has the key. -I'll break the door down. -No, Bill, don't please. You better get help. -You mean I've come all the way up here for nothing? -I'm afraid so. Goodnight. -Yes, goodnight, Mr. Wakeman. -Goodnight. -Major, come quick. -What's the matter? Where's Barbara? -In the lab. The door's locked, and there's someone in there with her! -I thought you said the door was locked. -It was. -She's gone. -Cover the main entrance. That's the only way anybody could leave. -I will. -In that case, we would've seen her on our way up. -Then she must still be in the building. We better split up. I'll take the roof. -Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Where are you? Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Where are you? Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Where are you? Barbara! Have you sighted her? -Not yet. -She must be around here some place. -Now you stay here. Watch the main entrance. And I'll check the basement. -She's not up there. Where's the doctor? -He went down to the basement. Here he comes. You didn't find her? -No. I better call the police. -But there's no telling what could happen to her in the meantime. -No, no. Take it easy. We're doing the best we can. -But she said she was locked in. And she couldn't see who did it. Can you explain that? -No. Not yet. -[GASPS] Who are you? Don't come near me. I'm warning you! Don't come near me! [SCREAMS] Don't! The code. I don't understand. You're trying to tell me you need it to breathe, and there isn't much left in the tank. One, one two, one, one two, three. I'll-- I'll write it down. One, one two, one, one two, three. [GASPS] [SCREAMS] -Barbara! -In the lab! -No, please, don't. -She's in there. -Barbara! BARBARA: I can see its hand. [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] -Darling, are you all right? -I think so. I'm looking for it. I just saw him, so he must be in here. [BARKING] -It's 70 feet to the ground. He would be killed. [BARKING] -It was frightening! I couldn't see him. I didn't know what to do. -Come here, quickly. -His suit, it's disintegrating. -This is amazing. [BARKING] -Now, quiet down, Venus. Quiet down. Down. [BARKING] -Mobile center from mobile one, come in, please. MAN (ON RADIO): This is mobile center. Go ahead. -Get ahold of Major Andrews or Dr. Wyatt at the institute. I want to talk to either one of them. MAN (ON RADIO): Will do. Stand by, mobile one. -Dr. Wyatt speaking. Oh yes, Mr. Hazen. Yes, we're still at it. Lots and lots of excitement. But nothing definite yet. Have you anything to say? -The trouble seems to be just about gone. We get a flash in the direction of the observatory once in a while, but I figure that's because of the outfit you're testing. -Yes. Lieutenant Bowers ought to be here any minute. Of course. How long will it take you to get up here? Good. See you then. -Thank you, gentlemen. Put it down here, please. Barbara, plug that cord in over there. Now you're going to see I have to resort to ultraviolet light in order to show you what little there is left of the space suit. As you can see, it has reduced itself to this liquid. And it's in an evaporating stage. The helmet is in the lab and still intact. -This is amazing. All the radiation in this suit would-- why, it'd be fatal to a normal human being wearing it. -Of course. Furthermore, our respiratory system could never simulate gases such we have found in that breathing device. -Well then we have to assume our so-called X man carried his own atmosphere with him. -Excuse me. But as a matter of curiosity, why do we refer to this thing as a him? I thought it was invisible. -Under normal conditions, yes. Yet Mrs. Randall did see the imprint of a large foot and a massive human hand under the ultraviolet light. -How do you explain that? -I don't know, but the human body is composed of various elements with a carbon base. -Like coal. -Yes. Now Suppose we maintain the same chemical composition in the body of the X man but substitute silica for carbon. -Silica, that's glass. -Exactly. Now it is possible that a body with such a base, if it were subjected to an atmosphere foreign to its origin, might appear invisible to our eyes. -Are you trying to say, doctor, that we're not dealing with a human being? -I didn't say that. On the contrary, all the evidence points in the opposite direction, toward a super human with an intelligence far superior to our own. -How can you tell? -First of all, Mrs. Randall saw that he had a hand with digits like our own fingers, and a thumb, opposing. That alone is a sign of intelligence. And he comes from civilization that has developed adequate space transportation to enable him to travel him to earth. We have nothing yet that can reach even another planet in our solar system. -That could account for the unidentified objects picked up by radar a few hours ago. -My theory is that the spaceship or whatever it was he came in operates under principle of magnetic rather than atomic proportion, and that somewhere in the out limits met with the condition where the earth's gravity pulled it down and it fell into the ocean, and that he managed to save his life and reach the shore. -You really can pick up any type of communications interference no matter how weak the signal may be. -Sure thing. We were on his trail from the minute he left the beach. -I never knew you carried such sensitive instruments in your car. -What you've told us is very interesting, doctor. But I've got to make an official report to head quarters. Are you willing to be quoted that the criminal we're after is a creature from another world? -All I can say is we know that our earth is not the only planet capable of sustaining life in one form or another. You can quote that. -All I've got to go by is some footprints and a hand. That is much. No fingerprints, no description, no nothing. And we're after a killer. -Has it occurred to you that our X man has no apparent motivation for his acts and might therefore not be an intentional criminal at all? -You have a point there. -Hey, wait a minute. Come to think of it, the young boarder we suspected. He did say that the girl's husband through the first punch. So-- -So that could have been enough to provoke the strange creature. And the same could have happened at the second murder. -Sure. What about the fire in the oil fields? -Evidently our man sense the presence of some gases, which he thought might be utilized in his breathing apparatus. -Yeah, that could account for his presence at the oil refinery where something went wrong, causing the explosion. -Too bad he got wise to us and took off his uniform, or we'd have been able to catch up with him by now. -No, he didn't utter a word. But I'm convinced he was trying to convey a message to me. He kept tapping out a code. I wrote it down. -Let me see that, please. Doesn't make sense. -Well, it may be based on some mathematical we know nothing about. -But he was trying to tell us something. Why did he run away? [TAPPING] -What do you think of that? -Yeah. -Hazen must be crazy, sending out stuff like that. -I guess so. Let's try and get a hold of him. -Yeah. Mobile one from mobile center. Come in please. Mobile one from mobile center. Come in please. Mobile one from mobile center. Come in please. -Hey, that's central calling. -You better stay here by the car. I'll go tell Hazen. -Yes, [INAUDIBLE]. Of course. I'll mail you a complete report first thing in the morning. Yes, thank you. Oh and I'm-- I'm awfully sorry to have disturbed you so late at night. Right, goodnight sir. -He's around here, this invisible guy. He was in the car. -How do you know? -I was talking to Randall outside when I heard central calling. Before I could get over to answer, I saw the door open and shut by itself. -He's desperate. -Or all we know, he could be trying to send a distress signal to his home base, wherever that is. -Let's hope he doesn't get through. We've got enough problems with just one of those guys. -Well, at least we know he's around the vicinity. It's obvious what keeps him around. -Of course. It's got to come back for what little gas there is left in this helmet. -And when he does-- -Oh please, the most important thing is to take him alive. If we can only make him understand, there's no telling how much science can profit. -I'll go along with that, doctor. But I've got to make sure once he's cornered, I'll be able to hang on to him. -I think we're all agreed on that. -All right, good, then we must see from his angle. He's in an alien world. No doubt we are as frightening to him as he is to us. The most important thing then is to keep calm at all costs and do not mean to provoke him. NARRATOR: Immediately a simple plan the trap the phantom went into operation. All obstacles to his entry were removed. To erase any possible suspicion, the doors were left unguarded and inconspicuous electric eye equipment was set up. All this was connected to a makeshift control board, which would immediately signal the exact location of the trespasser. Now there was nothing to do but wait. The one road leading to the institute was blocked off to make sure no outsider would upset the plans or interfere in any way. -What's the big idea? -Sorry, nobody's allowed through here. -Who says so? -Lieutenant Bowers's orders. -Oh, is he up there? -He might be. -Well, you get word to him that Joe Wakeman of the Chronicle is here. -Sorry, bud, I can't leave. -Oh. What about them over there? Hey, you over there. -Me? -Yeah, aren't you the guy from the communications office? Didn't I see you down at the oil fields a couple hours ago? -What of it? -You got anything to do with it? -Well, you'll have to ask Lieutenant Bowers about that. -How can I if he won't see me? -That's a good question. -Well, it's a quarter till 4:00. He's sure taking his time. -Time is cheap. -Yeah, well, how long can you sit on the edge of your chair like this? -[INAUDIBLE] if we have to. -I only hope this mechanism works. -It will unless he flies in between the wires. -I wouldn't take any bets that he can't. -Well, if everything else fails, we still have Venus here to help us. You know, I'm certain she sensed his presence before. That's why she carried on so. -What's the matter, Lieutenant? Is this thing getting you? -Oh, no, no, I was just thinking about public reaction to all this. I've got to get something to the press by morning. -You know, ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a pilot. Then after I got my wings and then had 75 missions, I thought I'd seen everything. Now after all this, I know I haven't seen anything. [BEEPING] -He's here. -[INAUDIBLE]. Let's [INAUDIBLE]. [BARKING] [BEEPING] -This way. [BARKING] -Cut it out! -Stop! -What are you guys trying to do? -Well, it's the reporter. -Yeah, it sure is. What's going on around here? You guys crazy? [BEEPING] -How'd you get in here? -Oh, that don't make any difference. Come on. What's up? What's going on? [BARKING] -All right, Lieutenant. You better tell him. I'll reset the wires. -Don't [INAUDIBLE]. We want you to live. Don't you understand? Can't you speak? Can't you say something, anything in any language? Listen, everybody. He's in the lab with me now. He's in the lab with me now. [BARKING] Venus, be quiet. The door is unlocked. Hurry, he's having trouble breathing. I don't think he can last much longer. And please, don't let Venus get at him. And walk in quietly. -Quiet, Venus. -It's unbelievable. -You see, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nobody wants to hurt you. -I've tried to reason with it. I feel he understands, but he can't speak. -Wait a minute, I'll try his code. I think I remember it right. [KNOCKING] -Better plug in the ultraviolet light. [CRASH] -You scared him. -There goes Venus! [BARKING] -Look, Venus! -He must be there. -He's going to the roof. [BARKING] -He's gone up there! -Take this. I'm going after him. [BARKING] The door! In here with the big telescope. -Close the dome. The switch is over there. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Quiet, Venus. -Well, if he's in here, he'll never get out now. -This is what I've been waiting. Please, Lieutenant, this is our last chance. We have to take him alive. -Plug in the lamps. There's an outlet here. -[GASPS] He must be up there! His whole body's [INAUDIBLE]. -If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes-- -What do we do now? -Stand back. -Amazing. -It's cold again. Look, he's trying to speak, but no sound is coming out of his mouth. -Look at Venus. She acts as though she hears him. -Yes, the dog can hear sounds that we can't. His voice must be beyond the range of the human ear. Maybe he's screaming. -He's suffocating. The glow, it's almost gone. [SCREAMS] -We won't need these lights anymore. In death he has become visible as a normal body. -He's evaporating. We are [INAUDIBLE]. And right before our eyes his body went through the final phases of life. Well, it's morning. [MUSIC PLAYING]
