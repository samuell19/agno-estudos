What's that you're looking at? This. The Book of Prophecies? Kenji wrote this. It'd be fun if the future really turned out like this. Will you let me be your friend? You can have a look at this too. The New Book of Prophecies? In 2015 at a church in Shinjuku a savior will rise to uphold justice and be struck by an assassin. Expo forever, Expo forever! For the progress and harmony of mankind. Twentieth Century Boys Chapter 2, The Last Hope How are you, Number 3? You resisted so hard at first... Now you're much more subdued. I have to go out on an assignment now. It has something to do with your last hope. If circumstances so demand even God's Child... will have to get a rejection. Kanna! Get them! Shit! Go! Go get him! Go! I'm finished! I won't let those Thai bastards have it. The plan to make Friend a new god and end mankind. "Chinporo Restaurant" Another gun shot. Kanna, don't let the pepper steak go cold! If a bullet or two bothers you we'd go out of business... Here it is. Yes, that's the one. This is so good. Kanna. Here's the Spicy sauted pork and Sweet and sour prawns, too! OK. Take your time. Thank you. It's the Chinese and the Thai mafia. There'll be a showdown at Nathan Alley. Nathan Alley? Behind the municipal office where the Chinese hang out. Yum! Nathan Alley... Kanna, where are you going? We're busy! Behold the King of Kabuki-cho! Damn it! This is our turf! You, Thai scum! Go back to China! Kill them! Stop! What the? Never mind her. Stop it now! This alley does not belong to the Chinese mafia! This alley does not belong to the Thai mafia! This alley does not belong to the Chinese mafia! This alley does not belong to the Thai mafia! How would you reimburse us? Look what you've done to Seventh Dragon! No more shooting, OK? If you've got any complaints, go get your boss. Thank you, girl. Can you make me a ramen? Your ramen tastes like the one I ate with my uncle on First Lane. My Master's ramen. Dragon Ramen! Does he still have that restaurant? He died... on Bloody New Year's Eve... I was his 7th apprentice so I called this place Seventh Dragon. Hey! Are you the girl who bullets dodge? I'm Chaipon from the Thai mafia. Don't glare at me. You told my men to call me for a truce. So here I am. Here is the Chinese boss too. Hey! Hey! How lucky I am to see the Thai boss. He never shows himself in public. Al dente, extra onions, less pickles with extra BBQ pork. Serve these men the same. Yes, ma'am... Girl, I once knew a man with a glare like yours. That was back when I was still in Bangkok. He was a pain in the ass. I tried to have him killed many times but I failed, the bullets dodged him. People called him Shogun. Was he Japanese then? I don't know. Attention, class. This is very important. On December 31, 2000, when the deadly virus broke out worldwide I was convinced that it was the end. No laser string figures in class please. There was a newsflash in the middle of a TV show. A large unidentified object was moving across Tokyo. If Friend hadn't saved us, the world really would have ended. He stopped Kenji, the terrorist... You're wrong! You again, Kanna Endo... He wouldn't put himself in such a dangerous spot. I told you, the robot was remote-controlled! Is that what it looks like? They're confronting it! What do you think of Endo's suggestions? Kyoko Koizumi. Here! I've been here all morning. What do you make of this photo? I... Well... Anything strange? If you say so... It is strange. Turn in an essay discussing what's strange. Write "Kenji is a piece of shit." Shut up! Endo! Endo! You hit me! Stop playing! Stop fighting! Takako Tokiwa, Fire Prevention Supervisor Sit down and listen to me, Kanna. I've done nothing wrong. Your grandmother still thinks you're living with me. She has no idea that you ran away to live in this dump alone. The school constantly complains about you... If something happened to you, what would I tell Kenji? You've changed, Auntie Yukiji. Why did you quit fighting them? Don't call me Auntie! Don't play Kenji's song so loud! Turn that music down! It's god damn noisy. Please do not too much! I'm terribly sorry about the noise. Apologize to the gentlemen! We have an ambition to defy CGI trends with ink and pens to bring back romantic comedy manga, right Ujiki? These two could never understand our ambition, Kaneko. Un. We're very sorry. Read this and you'll see our honorable ambition. Well? If I may give my honest impression of this story... I do not see any spirit or passion invested in it. I don't look for shallow romance in a story, and maybe it's silly but I want to hear about a hero who's out to save the world. We people would always be grateful for you to save our planet from extinction. LOVE, PEACE, FRIEND Uncle Kenji, do you remember... The taste of that Dragon ramen... Where are you now? I know you're not dead! Show yourself to me now! "Former Congress Station" A real man who protects peace on the planet. Should we try a manga about a man saving the world? No, we'd end up getting arrested Like Mr. Takarazuka and Nishimori, Aotsuka and Kakuta. We should request a pardon from Friend and get them released. Let's do that. Right! Dear people. The end of mankind is near. The satanic salesmen will bring an end to us. But if you believe in me if you stay close to me, you shall be given salvation. I'll visit the Kabuki-cho Church next month. I advise you not to take risks. It'll be OK. What a mess... His face is unrecognizable. Identifying him won't be easy. Officer Chono, pull yourself together. Aren't you the grandson of the cop legend? Lieutenant, the priest is here. The priest? It's too early for a funeral service. I'm Father Nitani from the Kabuki-cho Church. Hey! Hey! Lee Cheng-Gui, I knew it was him. He used to belong to the Chinese mafia. He went straight but... I got a message from him. He wanted to tell me something. Something important. He's involved in the mafia turf war. The killer could have just used a knife or a handgun. But he used a shotgun... This was not a Mafia persecution. Friend conferred with US President Tyler this morning at the Friendship & Democracy Party Headquarters. It's so troublesome. An essay on Bloody New Year's Eve. Bummer... President Tyler promised unconditional support for Expo 2015. And said that cooperation from America and other allied nations would determine the success of Expo 2015. Friend expressed gratitude for the President... What are you doing here? I'm reminiscing about Kenji. You mean, the terrorist Kenji Endo? Yes. If it had been a bowling game... Kenji was in for a great game until the very last frame. Then Kenji had the snake eyes, the 7-10 split. So what we learned at school is... It's all nonsense that Friend and his political party made up. You! You know Kanna Endo, don't you? Yes. She's his niece. Kanna is Kenji's niece. I had no idea whatsoever. It's better not to know. If you knew too much you might go there before me. Up to heaven. Up there? This month we're having a maximum security campaign. The objective of our raids in Kabuki-cho is to get the mafia war under control before it gets out of hand. Officer Chono! Pay attention! I'm sorry, Sir! Listen. Have no mercy on illegal aliens. They're criminals, the scum of society. Chono, you can sit. Yes, sir. I have a list of businesses to raid that harbor illegal aliens. Rose Garden. Chinporo Restaurant, one of the worst. Chono, check it out. But... What are you waiting for? Go quickly. Kanna, it's a police raid. Get out of here, go on! Police! Hands on the wall now! Cuff them! - Go! - Go! Yes, sir. Stop it! Don't be so rough! Please stop! I didn't do anything. What's the meaning of this? Excuse me. You've got the wrong man! What are you doing with Mr. Zhen? He's done nothing! Hey, show me your passport... That's assault! Let go! Give it back. That's my cap. Behave yourself. Do not bully the weak. You stupid bullies! I hate the police! Let go! Take him away. "Sgt. Chosuke lgarashi" It's you... Sorry. I was out of order arresting you... They let me off. This is my grandpa who was called Cho-san. He was a cop legend. This is yours... Is that a memento of someone special? Did you lose your family to that satanic terrorist, Kenji? Uncle Kenji is innocent. Uncle Kenji? That's right, your family name is Endo... Is there anything you want to tell me? You can confide in me. A Walkman cassette player... This is vintage. It's December 31, 2000. I'm recording a song. This is Bob Lennon. As evening shadows fall. There's the smell of curry in the alley How much more do I have to walk. Before I get back home? The Book of Prophecies? Uncle Kenji wrote it when he was a child. Someone made the prophecies a reality and framed Kenji. By doing so, he became powerful. At the end of this Century the Evil Organization commenced its plan. December 31, 2000 finally arrived. With horrifying, earth-shattering footsteps the shadow of terror had arrived in Tokyo. Will we survive to see the 21st Century? Is this the end for Tokyo and the world? On the night of December 31, 2000. This is ground zero of the explosion. Uncle Kenji tried to save the world. I wish those little things. That you do everyday Last day after day. Forever and ever. Thank you. Your uncle's drawings are horrible ...his song's not any better... Um! You should be more careful with your belongings, Officer Chono! I'm not going to heaven before him... Where's heaven anyway? What's that muttering? By the way... forget that essay on Bloody New Year's Eve. Oh, great! Join the Friendland program instead. I wrote a letter of recommendation. Friendland! Why? I'm going to be killed? Of course not. You're going with Kanna Endo. Train hard! There's a man I want you to meet. She's not really a man... but she was. She's in here. Here... Oh, my breasts! Britney, don't worry it's me. You can come out. I've brought Kanna here. What's this place? I'm with the Shinjuku Angel. Mariah! You've got stubble! Are you Kanna? Thanks for all the food. Britney is under age. Britney used to work with me but she violated the Amended Act for the Protection of Youth and was sent to Friendland on a correctional program. Friendland? I wanted to get out of there fast so I was a model student. But I did too well. They put me in the Bonus Stage. So I escaped. What's the Bonus Stage? It's a scary place... It's hot and dirty with lots of poor kids in ragged clothes... At night I went to a lab in an elementary school... A lab? Your panties! I'm scared... I saw Friend's... I saw Friend's... If I tell you you'll be killed like Lee Cheng-Gui! I told him what happened at Friendland. This is what he told me... The plan to make Friend a new god and end mankind? The plan to make Friend a new god and end mankind. What does it mean? I don't know. Shouldn't we go to the police? No! I hate the police! I hate them too but... maybe that young officer is OK. You work at Chinporo restaurant! You're a police officer! Unbelievable... I thought you were nice... That's discrimination! You informed on Mr. Zhen! Well, illegal aliens are criminals, you know. Where to? Investigations. That way. I'll see you later. What's wrong? Britney? He's the one... He killed Lee Cheng-Gui. Sorry I'm late. What took you? We got a tip. A transvestite was seen at Lee's murder site. We spent all night looking for his hideout. Go check it out. A hideout... Why are you here? You're one of them, aren't you? Hey, what's going on, Chono? Go. Nothing unusual. Go, quickly! I know who killed Lee Cheng-Gui. Chono. What are you doing? Thank you, this is my dead father's razor... She lost her dad on Bloody New Year's Eve. This will give me the courage to leave Tokyo. Your panties! You followed me! Run, he's a cop! Run! Wait! Run! You can trust me, you can tell me the truth. He's so strong! Kanna, I've got a gut feeling that we can trust him. He has white teeth, a straight nose and innocent eyes. We can give him a chance. I've never seen anything stranger... The Thai and Chinese mafia are enemies but they're sitting together. They insist on guarding me. I didn't ask them to. I can tell them to leave if... Who are they protecting you from? Are you sure nobody can hear our conversation? Actually there is somebody who can hear us... What? Is this place bugged? No. But this is a house of the Lord. Right, God. That won't be a problem. Is that so? What do you think of Friend, Father? I'm too far removed from the ordinary world to give opinions... Sho-chan, nice to see you! How have you been, Sir? I have no freedom now. Can't even play pachinko. You're our hero, Sir. Nobody else had a big carrier leap from a cop to the Police Commissioner! Sir Yamazaki is the ideal man who we expect ourselves to be. Come on, call me Uncle Yama-san like you used to. Okay. Sho-chan it's been so long! Help yourself. Make yourself comfortable. So you mean an officer in uniform killed the Chinese man? The transvestite is in my custody. Nobody else knows about this. Not my boss, colleagues... Where is the transvestite now? Maybe I shouldn't... It's OK. You shouldn't tell me. Someday you'll be called the new Cho-san. See. Good evening, Sir. Cho-san. If only you hadn't been so nosy back then... He's your grandson, all right. Making the exact same mistake. Give that young man a rejection. I don't trust you. Come on, I spoke to the higher-ups at the police. I'll protect Britney until the case is solved. Hands up. What? If your cell phone's on, they can locate us here. It's off. Of course it's off! I'm a professional. What are these? Good luck charms. Mom made me carry them. You have a bunch of them! Enough! Can I have one, please? Not her. Give one to me! Mankind will soon come to an end. It's time to join us and become one with the universe. Mom's good luck charm... Cute! 78 Yo! Sexy! I never want to stop dancing! Come on, dance with me. No, I don't really know how... Put your hand here. Let's start. That's not a dance, that's judo! So funny! Thank you. All my life I wanted to be a dancer. I thought I'd rather die then give up my dream. They sent me to that scary place... to that other world... Thank you. Handsome detective. You're off duty now, Officer Chono. Take out your gun! Loaded, safety catch off! He's gone! Where is he? Britney, no... Don't die! Oh no, Britney! Cover your panties! Oh no, Britney! You said you'd protect her! I made up my mind to go to Friendland. To Friendland? Something is there. I'm sure of it. Maybe Friend's secret. I'm going to see it for myself. You can't Kanna. It could be dangerous. Uncle Kenji said it's not embarrassing to turn your back and run. But he didn't run. He never did. I won't run from this either. Kanna. So do you know who Friend is? No, I don't. No, but he must be one of my childhood friends. Did you fall asleep? When you suddenly go silent like this, it makes me nervous... I finally got through. Structurally your cell is the best way out of here. Oh, my God... You must be the one I talked to from across the corridor? Can I go with you? My name is Kakuta. Who are you? Call me Shogun. I found an amazing pub on the mainland. What? Babes descend from the ceiling. Babes! Wearing no pants! Serious? Serious? They have annual passes. The ceiling opens like this. Like this! Come on, manga artist. Follow the ocean smell. Yes, sir... Wait! Wait for me! Listen! We've got to get out of this freezing seawater quick. Or else we'll be finished. But it's quite a swim back to Tokyo... My friend never gave up hope in the most hopeless situation. He always played his guitar and sang. Faith... That was a nice fantasy... But this is reality. Wait here, manga artist. What? Shogun! Shogun! No... It's impossible... I told you to wait! I have faith too! What's wrong? Who's responsible for this charade? Look at that... Hello welcome, hello welcome From the countries of the west "Expo '70, Color Guidebook" First, the Tower of the Sun. And we have to go to both the US and USSR pavilions. If we go to both of them we'll be waiting in lines all day. We'll have no time for anything else. But my uncle can only show us around for 2 days. We'll squeeze in as much as we can. We'll choose 5 pavilions each and make a schedule. Anything wrong, Kenji? The party's over for me... What? I can't go to the Expo. Why not? Dad decided to take us to a beach in Chiba on the same weekend... My relatives go away for 5 days so we can stay at their place... Dad's too stingy to spend money on the bullet train! Where do you think my relatives go for those 5 days? To the Expo! Hello. Are you by yourself? Yes. What's the matter? I need you to help Kanna. Please! Good morning, everybody! I'm Takasu, your dream navigator from Friendland Let's have fun and play games on our way to Friendland. Hold your spoon up! Put your thumb right here and say very loudly, bend! Bend! Which one of you has ESP? Bend! Bend! Why don't you bend! Of course it won't... My God... Kanna, do you have ESP? Thank you for your hard work! Thank you for your hard work! Welcome to Friendland! Here we are, please follow me. Don't wander off, you might get lost! These men known as Yoshitsune and Maruo are still at large. They look stupid but they are ferocious terrorists. That's not all! Change. Choji Ochiai, aka Otcho! He has the ruthless stare of a terrorist. And this is Kenji Endo. He looks bad! He's the devil who almost destroyed our world! Stage open! Next attraction. The Expo 2015 is around the corner. You'll see a documentary on Namio Haru, who sings the official Expo 2015 song, Hello-hello Dance! Enjoy it! Hello-hello, everybody Every lady and every gentleman "Friend News" "The National Hit Song's Origins" The F.D.P. Leader, Mr. Manjome and Mr. Namio met on this day. As a result of this meeting between two bright stars the song of the century was made. Mr. Manjome addressed the media, "Expo 2015 wouldn't have been realized" "without Friend, Namio Haru and this song." "Friend News 2 Friend with the Pope" Friend had a video conference with the Pope. The Pope praised Friend as a saint close to God. But Friend told the Pope that he was merely doing his job. Many were moved by his humble words. Give me your pastry. Ouch! Ouch! Welcome to Kingmart. Get away from me! Ouch! Kyoko Koizumi, I love your enthusiasm! Kanna Endo, I know you can do better. This is stupid... There is it. Nobody touched it. I can play some games. No worldly temptations here, sorry. I'll keep this for you. Goodnight! Microphones? Micro cameras? Where? Here? Not here... "Help me" I found her! There she is, right there! No! Let go of me! Calm down, there's nothing to be scared of. No! One extra entry for the Bonus Stage! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Hold it! Where are you taking her? I think I know you... No, you're completely wrong. You're Uncle Yoshitsune. I am not Uncle Yoshitsune. We salute you, Commander! Commander? Where am I? This is Uncle Yoshitsune's secret base. I told you I'm not Yoshitsune. Who are they then? It's Mon-chan, Maruo and Fukube. Where are Uncle Kenji and Otcho? They are... As far as I know they're alright. You are Uncle Yoshitsune. Kanna. Yoshitsune! Oh, how I missed you! I missed you so much, Kanna. Oh, Uncle! The only way out of Friendland, is by graduating. Can't we escape? No. They'll soon find you. And then what would they do? They put you in the Bonus Stage. The Bonus Stage? That's where the high scoring trainees go. The Bonus Stage turns the players into one of 3 characters. Someone who is totally committed to Friend. Or someone who wouldn't question anything. Or someone who endures harassment. They all sound terrible! How do I get to the Bonus Stage? No, that's what you have to avoid! I have to go! Someone I know was sent to the Bonus Stage! They choose the best out of the top 10 trainees. The 2 highest scoring ones. How is it dangerous? Did you see the scribble in your dorm? "Help me" The man who wrote that became docile after going to the Bonus Stage. And then one day he killed himself. I did it. That last spurt by Kanna Endo was incredible! We have the winners for the Bonus Stage. Koizumi and Endo are the chosen ones! Ready? You're about to experience the most incredible world! It's buzzing! They're going to the Bonus Stage! They'll die if we don't help. We have to kill the power and force quit the system! Bonus Stage... Enter! Kanna Endo and Kyoko Koizumi... Bye-bye-bye! Is this heaven? Oh, the fumes! Where am I? Oh, my God! How disgusting! Excuse me. 15 yen. What? 15 yen for a vinegar squid. "Japanese Yen is actually revalued." "August 28, 1971" 1971! Where am I? "Kenji Endo, Class 6-3" Uncle Kenji! Who are you? I need to go somewhere... to the school lab. Well, don't expect me to go tonight. I have a cold and a fever too. Were you supposed to go to the lab, Uncle Kenji? Which uncle is that? I mean, Kenji. Mon-chan forgot to turn on the aquarium pump in the lab. But the lab is haunted by Katsumata's ghost at night. Katsumata? The boy who loved science experiments. He died a day before the dissection of carp. Mon-chan asked me to go but I told him to ask Donkey. Donkey doesn't believe in ghosts. Donkey... The one who was killed by Friend? Who are you anyway? I'll take care of it. I won't let you down, Uncle Kenji. I'll save the world for you. So promise me you won't die. That was a nice dream... Do you think Donkey is OK? Of course he is... It's Donkey after all! "Science Lab" It's on... Mon-chan must have forgotten he'd turned it on. Who is it? This is it! What should we do now, Commander? "This operation may leave players with brain damage." "Will you force quit?" YES NO She mustn't see the thing... Yes or... No! You look just the same! You're the Commander! What Commander, Lady? Lady? Don't treat me like a granny! I'm a teenager. Sorry, young lady... I came here to discover Friend's secrets. A friend? Is there a strange boy round here who wears a mask? Somebody who's kind of preachy and gets people to do things? Ah-men, So-men, Hiya-somen! That's him. Ah-men, So-men, Hiya-somen! What's he doing? Communicating with spacemen. Ah-men, So-men, Hiya-somen! Hey, you! Are you Friend? Take that off and show me your face. Is Donkey really OK? Where's the lab? Thanks. Yamane, is that you? It's a miracle. A miracle is about to occur. You don't make any sense! Take him down or he'll... Incredible! He's resurrected! No! Once you die, that's the end of you. But you saw it. Rejection... What do you want? Rejection! Rejection! The ghost! You two! What are you doing? This is OK. This is part of the master plan. Who are you? Show me your face! Yamane, give her a rejection. Rejection. Rejection. Stop it. She's the Chosen One. No, she's God's Child. What are you saying? She's the lovely baby I made with Kiriko. Will you become my friend if I showed you my face? I'll never be your friend. Never! What did you just say? It's the truth. It's the miracle. Commander! We'll be detected if we don't quit now! Force quit! I'm here at the Expo 2015 site. There are only 17 days to go. Would you take a look at how many tents there are. This is a pilgrimage for those seeking salvation. Next, I have news on Friend's upcoming visit to Shinjuku. It's been announced that Friend intends to carry out the visit. The Metro Police Department's "Friend Defense Unit" advised against the visit for security reasons as the area is known... for its criminal element. Separate the garbage. Don't mess it up. Yeah. What now, Shogun? Take it easy. We'll stay low for awhile. Maybe the police already stopped looking for us? The other day I passed a police box and there weren't any photos of us on wanted posters. But Friend is too unpredictable... He's full of surprises. So we couldn't lower our guard? It's a bomb! Hey, I had a dream that you'd show up. While you were locked up Japan became a horrible place to live. A hive for the underprivileged and criminals. How have you been, Kamisama? You don't look like you're homeless. I got bored with that. Now I'm having a go at being rich. A rich homeless? I made big on stock. That sounds like you. The stock market reflects the real world. Any company that grew rapidly after Bloody New Year's Eve is suspicious. And this is the most suspicious of them all. Daifukudo Pharmaceuticals. They profited from the virus vaccination. They went public and now they're one of the most profitable corporations. "Akio Yamane, CEO." Akio Yamane... Choji Ochiai. The science magazine this month is kind of lame. I remember him. Did you write the Book of Prophecies? How do you know? A friend told me. Who's your friend? Is that Kenji's silly idea? You are smart. You should choose your friends more carefully. Mind your own business. Come on, me and my friends wrote something better than your Book. We call it The New Book of Prophecies. You both saw the masked boy's face in the virtual 1971. Is he in this photo? Oh, please! His face without the mask... I feel sick just thinking about it! There was another boy at the science lab. It was Yamane. Yamane? Is he the very smart one? He had The New Book of Prophecies. Who wrote that book? Yukiji, you can tell her. I met Mon-chan 2 years after Bloody New Year's Eve. He was terminally ill in hospital. Where's The Book of Prophecies Kenji wrote? Kanna has it. It's a reminder of Kenji. I did quite a lot of research... and got hold of some duplicates. I have them here... What's that, Mon-chan? The New Book of Prophecies. Somebody continued Kenji's Book of Prophecies. In 2015 at a church in Shinjuku a savior will rise to uphold justice and be struck by an assassin. I have 3 pages. There must be more. Who wrote this? I don't know. How did you get these? I received them in an anonymous letter. Kenji put up a fight... and so did Otcho. Fukube too. I'll fight to the end like they did and find out the truth. Mon-chan... 2 days after that he disappeared. Why did you keep such an important thing a secret, Auntie Yukiji? This doesn't concern you. Besides it's dangerous... Do you seriously think this doesn't concern me? Are you keeping any more important secrets from me? No, I'm not. Auntie Yukiji? No. Good. Kyoko. You made it back! Friendland must be really special. How come? It changed you and Kanna, you've both become model students. It's the new guy. Who? The substitute teacher. Hello, class. Let me introduce myself... Koizumi! I'll take her to the nurse. And you are? Kanna Endo. Ah, so that's Kanna Endo. Are you OK? The boy I saw on the roof with the mask... Teacher Office Where's the new teacher? He's taking a sick student home. I have to get my bag... Hello. Pleased to meet you, Kyoko Koizumi. My name is Kiyoshi Sada. The kids called me Sadakiyo at the last school. What's the name of the new teacher? It's Kiyoshi Sada. Kiyoshi Sada? I know this. It's uh... a robot. I know this, what was it called? It's Gundam! It's Gigantor! Don't call Gundam a robot! You're still saying "Robot". You know nothing about it. Did you know her? Who? Did you know that Endo has ESP? What... Well... She bent a spoon... I knew it! I had a hunch about her. Only Kanna Endo can stop him. And she'll find us with her ESP. I was happy when he contacted me as an adult. He remembered that I'd changed school. Many thought I died... I didn't tell anyone his secret! What secret? He couldn't go to Expo '70. He didn't want anyone to know. So he got disguised as me during that summer. This is me and this is him. Is that right? Do you have a photo of his face? Not on me now but... you want to see it? Will you come with me? It's quite far. No, thank you... Don't hesitate, come on in. This... Wait... Nobody else is here. This is Friend Museum. This is a replication of Friend's childhood home. Do you want to see Friend's room? No, I don't want to. Here it is. This is Friend. No, please... I really don't need to. I always wanted a friend. Always... No! Ouch! What's with the mask? You're a weirdo! Let's go. What's that you're looking at? This. Have a look. "The New Book of Prophecies" Will you let me be your friend? He was the only friend I had. Oh, no... We're surrounded. Chief Takasu has arrived, thank you. Thank you. Takasu, a request for a rejection. Requesting a rejection! What are we going to do? They'll give us a rejection. Rejection? Hello? Did you want to see me? I looked all over for you, Sadakiyo. Shimon? Did you send me The New Book of Prophecies? Thank you for telling me everything. Your account will turn things around. Your courage will save the world. Mon-chan. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy... I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy... I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy... I have to... I have to protect you. Ah-men, So-men, Hiya-somen... Ah-men, So-men, Hiya-somen... I've lived a life of deception for 13 years. What about Friend? Is he a good guy, or a bad guy? How about me? Can you keep this for me? What? It's the Mon-chan Memo. Everything's in here. Wait... Mr. Sada? Rejection granted. Rejection granted! Let's give a rejection. With pleasure! Kerosene? Stop! It's Kanna Endo. You're... Sadakiyo? You found us because you have ESP. He's on our side. He's betraying Friend to help me. He gave me this. The Mon-chan Memo. Mr. Sada, open up! But I'm a bad guy. Mr. Sada, come with us. Kanna. It says on the memo where your mom was in 2000. You have to find her. Mon-chan told me when we met. He said he was terminally ill but he wanted to live! But I... I'm sorry! Sorry! Mr. Sada! Mr. Sada! Let's move in. Thank you, our pleasure! Not even a scratch on the furniture. Yes! Hey, guys! I poured this everywhere. I'll set fire to it. No, don't! I'll strike this. Don't! Open the door! Go, now! Open it! Open the door please! We have to run! Kanna, hurry! Come on, this way. "Where's Kiriko? Odeon Cinema, Naruhama Hospital" This town has always been desolate. Things picked up for a while. A hospital was built up on the cliff. People moved here. Things improved so much that there was talk of a freeway being built. Then it was suddenly canceled. How come? Because of the virus that makes people bleed to death. I think this was the first place in Japan that the epidemic broke out. How long ago was that? In about 1995. It wasn't a big outbreak. Only a few actually died. Thank God, that lady doctor was here. The lady doctor? She worked for the hospital on the cliff. She loved movies. As a kid she saw Son of Godzilla with her brother. We used to talk quite a lot. "Naruhama Hospital, Virology Research Lab" Dr. Yamane. Mom's lab... University of National Gainde Hospital Center... Medical Doctor... She studied medicine in Africa. "Monkey bled and died." "The Endo team succeeded in multiplying the virus." No... It can't be true. "I am Godzilla." "I trod on 150,000 lives." She made the virus? Mitsuyo, I love you! That was kind of lame. Can I do it again? Naoki, you're wasting film. We had a film festival to promote the town. During that a vox populi was done with the locals. Give a love message. Say something to your man. Never! Shioya? Say something. Hello? Are you sleeping? This is Kiriko Endo M.D. Oh, this is it. I can't look you in the eyes. I've done something horrific. I can't see my brother... Nor my daughter... Doctor? What I did is as monstrous as Godzilla. Sorry I'm being so vague... But somebody might understand what I'm trying to say. Doctor... If they're still in power after the year 2002... A love message please... Somebody please stop them! You have to stop them! Otherwise the world will end in 2015. We'd better cut here. Doctor Endo, please. This is the second take. They shot it again. Kanna. Kanna! Do your very best to find happiness. "Yamane" Hey, you! Are you Dr. Yamane's childhood friends by any chance? Yes, that's right. Name of your school? Shinjuku Third Elementary. Class? 6-3. Year of birth? Boar. Correct! You finally came. I was asked to give this to his childhood friends. What a charming thing for a big company CEO to do! You two are dressed just like thieves! Take a bath, OK? What's wrong? What's this? Secret Meeting Notice "Meeting on the night of March 7, 2015." Location: Experiment Classroom Experiment Classroom of the elementary school Yamane wants to see me at the school lab. Schools at night are scary. There might be ghosts here. Ghosts... I wonder if Donkey really saw a ghost back then. "Science lab" The door's open. I've been waiting for you, Choji Ochiai. Yamane. Are you Friend? I'm a research scientist. That's all I've ever wanted... Then in 2003 Kiriko showed up. Kenji's sister, Kiriko? We worked together until Bloody New Year's Eve. No Entry! Yamane, Fire Prevention Supervisor I wanted to console her, so I said, "Even if your brother is a terrorist who used the virus to kill people" "your vaccine stopped it at 150,000 casualties. So don't be depressed." I was anxious to tell her about the new virus that was deadlier than the one used on Bloody New Year's Eve. Only Dr. Kiriko can make a vaccine for my virus. Then Dr. Kiriko confronted me. "Who made the virus my brother is supposed to have used?" Who made the virus my brother is supposed to have used? We did! Now you made a virus deadlier than the last one! Friend's plan is to use it to end our world! It was just a game I played with Friend... Then he made all our dreams come true. That's what I believed until Kiriko told me the truth. It's a lie! He's not saving the world. Dr. Kiriko, please! Give me all the data! No! - Give me all the data! - No! Now I'm one of history's mad scientists. Go public. I'll help you do it. Choji Ochiai, do me a favor. Friend will visit Shinjuku. That's our only chance. Chance? Chance to do what? To assassinate Friend. "In 2015 at a church in Shinjuku" "a savior will rise to uphold justice" "and be struck by an assassin." This is live from Shinjuku. Today, Friend inspects Shinjuku, the world's worst crime zone. In order to see how things are and to mingle with the locals Friend wants security cut to a minimum. A lot of followers of Friend gather here. Is this prophesying Friend's assassination? That'll solve all our problems. Friend goes to Shinjuku. Is Kanna at school? I think so. Oh, didn't you know that she went to see some priest? A priest? At some church in Shinjuku. "...at a church in Shinjuku" "a savior will rise" What if this savior refers to Kanna? "And be struck by an assassin." Let's go. Would you believe that Friend had Lee Cheng-Gui killed? The plan to make Friend a new god and end mankind. These were Lee's last words. Would you believe that Friend plans to terminate mankind? How do you think he'll become God? A man cannot turn himself into a god. This is like reuniting with an old pal. Shogun. I'm here because you asked a favor of me. What did he say? This is a map of Friend's route through Shinjuku. I don't care what you're up to. No questions asked. But I can give you a very special tip. Friend will take a detour off this route to a church. A church? Church. He said a church. Father Nitani of the Church of God is remarkable. He has a good relationship with the Pope. Remember, Friend met with the Pope recently. The Pope asked Friend to deliver a message to Father Nitani. My men happen to be at the church now. Your men? Why? What did he say? There's a girl there and I'm a big fan of hers. The cops are after her so I have to protect her. That's right... She has eyes just like yours. I guess I've gone soft. I had no idea that she was Kenji the terrorist's niece. Kanna! Faster! I can't let anything happen to Kanna. I promised Kenji I'd look after her. Everybody look! See how brave Friend is. On his way to the most dangerous criminal zone in the world. Friend, our beloved Friend is the only man on Earth who can stop this catastrophe. Friend, who makes the whole nation proud slowly waves at his people just as a hero would. What's this? Who are they? They're not mafia members. What's happening? Friend will come here. Friend? To this church? What for? To see you, Father. That's why they're here... Yes, they want to see Friend. Excuse me. Excuse me. Kanna! Excuse me. Kanna! Kanna! Kanna, get down! Kanna, run! A savior will rise to uphold justice and be struck by an assassin. Drop it now! Uncle Otcho! Kanna... She's our last hope. So I was the savior... Stay down. Now, that silly cop is killed off. Pick it up, Number 3. Otcho... Look after Kanna. Otcho? Out of the way! Otcho! Uncle Otcho! Shogun! Out of the way. Out of the way. Move it. Move! Out of the way! Hello, Choji Ochiai. Don't worry, he's my old friend. Besides it's wrong to point guns at citizens. Take the mask off. Who are you? Would you be my friend if I took it off? We're not kids anymore. Playtime is over. Shota wanted to play with you too. What? Like me, Shota had no friends. Like me, he wanted to talk to you about his problems. He'd been blamed for something he hadn't done. Shota was waiting for you. There were things he wanted to talk about. What is it that you are talking about? Who the hell are you? Don't you recognize me? Don't you? Do you remember what Shota looked like? You must remember him. Dad... When can we play together? Dad... Sir, it's about your son, Shota. Tell him I'll call back. Sorry, please go ahead. It's bad news, sir. Your son mistook someone for you and chased him across the road. Dad! He was hit by a truck. You killed our son! You killed him. You murderer... What has my son got to do with you... I was lonely like Shota. Misunderstood. Look at this. You must remember this, Ochiai. You little punk. Say you stole it! I didn't do it! Where did you get this then? You... It's you! Get down! That man shot him! Yamane... It's over now... Shogun, run! Here we go! Haruo Nami The Northern Enka Show" Hello-hello, everybody All over the world Hello-hello, everybody Every lady and gentleman It's 2015, you've got hello-hello Dance, it's a celebration He's far too good to be performing here... I'm so lucky to see him... Is that true? Salesmen wearing NBC gasmasks came to town. Suitcases that they left behind released a mist that killed many. It's true. Now everybody in town believes that the doomsday prophecy's coming true. So... it's great that Mr. Haru came to cheer us up with his show. On the other hand, I feel helpless. I'm a medical doctor but I can't save those who are dying... Don't say that... It's true, Mr. Haru's manager! Live from Shinjuku. At 1 pm today, in this very spot Friend was shot in the chest during an inspection and has died. Can you see the people crying? They're screaming, "Give Friend back." An escaped prisoner at large is suspected of being the shooter. A terrorist whose name is Choji Ochiai. At 1:20 pm, Friend passed away Otcho? At the hospital. Repeat! At 1:20 pm, Friend passed away at the hospital. The flags are flying at half mast in mourning at the UN today. In his mourning speech for the death of the great hero, the President of the United States expressed his deepest regret and concluded he was indeed a true Friend. The Palace has announced that it's considering awarding Friend an honorary title. It can only be a matter of time before a role of honour is bestowed upon our great Friend. I'm here at the site of a moving drama. Where Friend and his people heroically saved many lives. Our friend. The President decided to honor our late great friend and create a "Friend Memorial Day." Who can replace him as leader? Friend, we will remember you forever. Mankind has lost Friend. His body is lost but not his spirit. In the name of his Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. I'll go alone. The whole world prays for you. You trickster... I know you have one last surprise for us. You knew either Otcho or Yamane would come to kill you. As you planned the Expo 2015 will be your funeral. No... Maybe it'll be the greatest show on Earth! The Expo Organizers announced that tomorrow's opening ceremony will be held as scheduled. The Friendship & Democracy Party has suggested that the ceremony will be held in honor of Friend's demise. What? The opening will be his funeral! Many will attend from all over the world. The opening ceremony will be presided by Friend's body. People have come in incredible numbers to the stadium to witness this monumental occasion. Friend spared no effort in realizing Expo 2015. Expo 2015 is indeed his dream come true. Half a century after Expo '70 progress and harmony for mankind will be achieved. And the City of the Future as we imagined. Expo 2015 opens tomorrow. And that fateful, unforgettable day arrived. Thank you all for waiting. We will now open the gates to the Expo 2015. The ceremony of the century is about to commence as the world prays for Friend. As doomsday gets closer we suffer the loss of our most valued Friend. Friend, you're eternal, and you are our one and only friend. Our only hope. The ceremony is broadcast live in 246 countries throughout the world. Billions are mourning the loss of our hero. It's almost time. I brought the priest. What's this about? The plan to make Friend a new god and end mankind. I figured out what it means. Friend died. But imagine what would happen if the dead came back to life. In recorded history only one man has returned from the dead. Kanna, wait! Friend, you were our only hope. You taught us the importance of having hope and believing in ourselves. Your name will forever be remembered by all of us. Now United Nations' Secretary General Brachltz will read an eulogy. I can't... Lord Jesus passed away and rose from the dead after 3 days. When a man dies and comes back, people see him as God. It's too late... Let's see... How's The New Book of Prophecies coming along? "The New Book of Prophecies" We're already on this page. "Brrring, the phone rings" "signaling that all is prepared." Hello? Good. Very well. "The satanic salesmen will destroy the world." Everyone. Bye-bye-bye! At the same time all over the world many salesmen in suits, wearing NBC gas masks were witnessed. Friend visited "Friends' Home." He shook hands with each orphan at the Home. The spirited children made Friend cry. Next, weather. Mist sprayed from suitcases creating rainbows... And that was the sign of... the end of the world as we know it.
