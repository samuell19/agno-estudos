[chanting the Hanuman Chalisa prayer] Hail Lord Rama! Hail Hanuman! Stand in queue... one behind the other. Praise the Lord. Yes, how many of you? Stand in queue as per your delivery date. ...nine months pregnant, come forward. Behind her stand... eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two and one. And women who are trying to get pregnant, eat tikkis first, you'll be served golgappas later. I'm due in two weeks, serve me quickly. How many times does the baby move? Three or four times. Get admitted in the hospital by day after. You'll deliver in the next four days. Here you go. Lala, will eating these golgappas guarantee a son? What do you want? For a mere 25 rupees, you want golgappas and a certificate too! If the government can't give you a guarantee... nor can ministers, doctors and engineers... You want a golgappa-seller to give you guarantee? - Gaffar... - Yes? - Take his bowl away. - Give it back. I'm just confirming... Go stand right at the back. Get lost. You mean, it may not be a boy? Come on, I'd heard so much about you, Lala. I just satisfy the cravings of pregnant women like my forefathers did. I don't grant boys... God does. Aunty, eat this with faith, you'll have a son. Even this 70 year-old board says - 'Eat chaat here and a son will be born'. You need to believe. - Come forward. - Please stand aside. Seven months pregnant women come forward. You can't park here, mister. Drop the lady off here... park your scooter over there. Durga didi is calling. Yes? What? The boy's family has arrived? So early? Weren't they supposed to come in the afternoon? Okay... make them comfortable... Yes, I'm wearing my slippers. No... listen... Let the guests eat the samosas Don't eat them yourself! Take it. - Manage the shop. - Sure. We haven't eaten yet, Lala... Madam, the golgappas ensure a son. I don't... He will serve you golgappas. But I'll have a boy, right? We're all after boys... you want one and I want four! Take this. Serve them. Don't forget to take money. Satinder, give me a kurta. I'm sure this boy will be a good match, brother. I hope so. Lala... take some sweets with you. And milk? Don't need it today. - I'll pay you later. - No problem. Make way... Lala, the boy's family is here. - You better hurry. - Lala... listen.... Laxmi took some gram flour. Adjust from my rent or pay me now? You pay a measly 275 rupees and you want to deduct 25 rupees from that too! Why even bother with the 250! Lala, return my mother's bangles. Get lost, you rascal! I refuse to pay you any money. Your son takes all the bottles of cold water from my house. There... I've adjusted your money. Get lost. Paying a measly 275 rupees and you want the world at your feet! Brother-in-law is here. Go take a bath, boy. Madam Durga... Doesn't any brand sell clothes your size? Brother... Are you wearing a child's t-shirt? This has shrunk after a wash! Give this to me. Why don't you shrink too, after a bath? Geeta, take this. Move. Please wear something that glows in the dark, Laxmi. Hello... I'm not that dark-skinned! And don't smile in the dark... only your teeth will be visible! Oh, sorry... I'm so sorry, Uncle. Our neighborhood is so crowded, couldn't get here sooner... - I'm sorry, Aunty. - No problem. I'm sorry. What is this behavior, Lala? Already making the groom's family wait? Please excuse me, Aunty. Thankfully, so many pregnant women, - wait at my shop every morning... - At your shop? It's more like I'm running a hospital. Will eating golgappas at your shop guarantee a son? I only promise a son but in my grandfather's times all boys grew up to be officers too. Gayatri... Please serve them tea. Neeraj was born after eating golgappas served by your father. I see... I can see that... boys born after eating at our shop stand out. Is that your younger brother? The one wearing a jacket. No. She is my youngest sister, - Saraswati. - Oh. - Do you watch action films? - No. She does, that's why she's like this. Come here... All my sisters are named after goddesses, Uncle. But I swear on my dead mother, she's the most dutiful one. The most obedient one. You can keep the tray. Excuse me. Yes... okay. Brother, Saharanpur has lifted the milestone! - They're offering 12. - 12? - They're offering 12. - Who is he? My brother-in-law. Wow, they're offering 12. But when I spoke to the priest, he said 11. 12... okay, fine... I don't have a problem. No problem! - Put the tray down. - Hold! Hold! Yes... okay. The milestone has been lifted again. They're offering 14 now, plus a honeymoon package via Vaishno Devi. Hail the goddess! But...We had agreed upon 11, then 12... and now 14? Okay, Mr. Gupta... I agree to 14. There goes my college fee. ...no more, please. - Put the tray down. - One minute... the milestone... I'll break your head with that milestone! Enough! 14.25... That's it! Final! It's decided! Put the tray down. Wait a minute. 16 is the new milestone. Brother... Keep quiet, you rascal. I'll give you a few thousand... stop talking. - Put the tray down, Gayatri. - One minute... The Saharanpur party is offering me 1 lakh, plus a tuxedo. Mr Gupta, let's seal the deal at 16 lakhs (hundred thousand). 16, final! - Put the tray-- - 17. Shut up, you rascal! I'd have to rob a bank to get 17 lakhs, Mr. Gupta. I would've managed for one sister but I have four! Mr. Kedarnath... I paid dowry for my daughter, hence I want dowry for my son. We have a long day ahead... let's go. They don't have any money! - Let's go. - Let's go. Bye. You! Let go of my samosa Let go. Take a video of this. I won't let you have it. Take this. Eat it! You too! Eat it! You too! You witch! Mummy... I won't give it. Witch! My samosa! Promise me, Kedarnath... till you get your four sisters married... you won't get married. Promise me. I promise you... Only after getting my four sisters married... will I think of getting married. Papa, please... Why are you being so petty? Kedara would've told us had the match had been finalized. - No. I want to humiliate him. - What? I want to insult him in front of everyone. He should know what it's like to be burdened with a young daughter! 'Burden'? Are you saying I'm a burden, Papa? You're not a burden to me, child. I worry about your marriage. Tell me... how long will you wait for this guy? First he'll marry off ALL his sisters... and only then he'll marry you! This dutiful son is honoring his promise to his mother... but I'm the one paying a price for it! How long will I have to wait to get my daughter married? I'm not that old... You're not, but he is. How long will he go around pretending to be young? We'll have to come to a decision! I'll decide who gets the samosa. I'm the eldest-- Kedarnath! Here comes Sapna's father, enjoy! Kedarnath, come out. It hasn't even been 10 minutes since they left... who informs him? Where are you, Kedara? Saraswati... tell him I've left. Tell him... Don't say that I've gone to the shop, else he'll land up there. - Don't tell him. - Kedarnath! Namaste, Uncle. Namaste, sister-in-law. Let her become your sister-in-law before you call her that. Did you finalize Gayatri's wedding? What did the boy's family say? They left within 15-20 minutes. They were asking for 17 lakhs. See. I told you so. Tell me... where's your dear brother? He has... gone to the bank! Look at how that rascal has taught this poor child to lie. What does he even have in that bank, to withdraw from? - Papa. - Be quiet. Tell me the truth. Where's your brother? It's the truth... he has left. He left right after the boy's family did. - Go... - Rascal... Witch! ...building a nest here. Where do you think you're running away like a fugitive? Who's running away? I'm going to the doctor. I have a blister right here. Saraswati said you've gone to the bank. I had gone to the bank to withdraw money to pay the doctor's fees. Then what are you doing up there? There's a nest here with a crippled duck... I was feeding it. You're such a liar. Have a conscience. You couldn't finalize Gayatri's marriage... all four of your sisters are unmarried... when will you get them married? When will I get my daughter married? Just see... how rudely your father is talking. See for yourself. What? What was so rude, Kedarnath - 'Have a conscience'? 'Gayatri's marriage'? Talk of our marriage or of having a young daughter? Tell me. What was so rude? Are you on his side now? Don't you earn enough feeding golgappas to all... pregnant women? Can't you afford a 17 lakh dowry for your sister? You think you'll take this money with you after you die? What money are you talking about? I pay 15 lakhs to the bank every month. You think I'm running away? If Sapna wasn't my childhood sweetheart, I would've run away by now. Really? Really?! Come on. Why don't you tell your father about the EMI's that I pay? - EMI for what? - 'EMI for what'?! He is asking me about my EMIs. Please tell him... Everyone in Chandni Chowk knows, Harishankar. During World War II, Lala's grandfather had a contract - to supply chickpeas to the Germans. - Hear him... and he'd taken a loan of 20 lakhs from the bank... Lala is still paying off the loan. If his grandfather hadn't been cheated by Hitler... his family would've owned this entire neighborhood. 'Chickpeas'? And who is Hitler? 'Who is Hitler'? The very same German Hitler! The one who stands like this! The very same Hitler. He's the reason your daughter is still unmarried. Hitler is dead but I'm still alive... I'm retiring in eight months... ...and I want her settled before that. You have six months... Marry her or I'll marry her off to someone else. And you can forget about your sweetheart. Idiot. Let's go. Hitler my foot! Come. Let's go. And what about my promise to my mother? Fulfill it. You don't have much time... get all four sisters married and then marry Sapna. Take some money to get your blister treated. ...talking about Hitler. 36 thousand in July... 34 thousand in August. Nothing in September? We only get what is destined, Brother. Mine... that of my sisters... and your destiny too is to be blamed for this. Come here... Sit. Your destiny is not to blame. My ledgers are to blame for this. You're my pride. It's these boys who are unlucky, not you. How will you manage, Brother? Even if you manage to put together my dowry... you still have three more to take care of. Do you know what Ma would say? She'd say - Lord Mahadev takes care of all daughters. He will provide for us. Why do you worry? Silly girl... There's no love like this... There's no love like this... There's no jealousy like this! If a sister asks her brother for something... He'd take a life... Not 'take a life' he'd give up his life. There's no love like this... Praise the Lord... Praise the Almighty. ...there's more stuff. I like the boy. Go. Come next week. But... why? I know of boys like him... they get famous on TikTok. I'll get you married to him. He's a scrap dealer! He'd come to pay for the cupboard. Fine, get me married to him... Coloring his hair and fooling everyone... - Give me 500 rupees, Brother. - Why? Did you lend it to me? I have to go to college. Do you have to pay to enter the college? I'll take a taxi... Take a bus. No way. I'll take a taxi. Else everyone will know that I come from a lower middle class family. I'll drop you off. No, I want to take a taxi. Brother... drop me to my tuition class on the way. Wait... drop me to my dance class too. Let's go. You're always asking me for money. I need to buy laboratory stuff for my Chemistry practical. Why do you need to buy them? Steal them. Watch out! You want your sister to steal? Sister? You're witches. All of you. And I want you to become robbers. Wow... Where are you going? She looked at me. Crazy boys. Fine, they're whistling at you two. I wish I was in that jeep. Keep quiet. What's wrong? Get off. But why? - Get off, I need to do something important. - But... Take 500 rupees and take a taxi. - Go. - I can't believe this. Take a taxi. Be careful. Auto. - Whistling at girls?! - Hey... - But... - I just whistled, what was so wrong? Grab him. Don't let him go! I just called a fat girl Fatty... I'll call your mother Fatty. Will you like it? Feel the heat? It's hot. Should've told me! Lala... Let me go. Let go of me. - Move. - He will die. Get lost! Forget it, Lala. Will you kill him for such a small thing? 'Small thing'? 'Small thing'? Do you really think it's a 'small thing'? Move it to the center of the road. Wait, let me get up! Move this! Wait! Stop. People of Chandni Chowk, listen ...to three things. Pay attention. First... four-wheelers aren't allowed to enter Chandni Chowk. Second... all boys in Delhi will have to control themselves. Else, I'll thrash them. I'll beat the living daylight out of them. Third... if any boy harasses a girl, he will have to marry her. - Well said, Lala. - Get it? I will make sure he marries her. Get it? They think they'll catcall and get away with it! Where's my slipper? Tastes okay. Add more lemon juice. I like it. One more, brother-in-law. Come on, really? You've already eaten a lot. These golgappas are very spicy, you'll have a tough time tomorrow morning. Leave. - Kedara... - What? You didn't stand up to your father for me yesterday. What could I have said? Papa was right. What was he so right about? He is retiring in eight months. Focus on your precious sisters... never mind me! Lala... Move aside... - Lala. - What is it? Here is your invitation card. Invitation? Chandramukhi is getting married next week. Please come to the party tomorrow... bring only one sister along. Chandramukhi is getting married? Yes. Hear that? Chandramukhi is getting married. Who is she getting married to? A boy, of course. He is a government clerk. Is he a normal, regular guy? Yes. - A widower? - No. It's his first marriage. Dowry? Not much. Who is the matchmaker? There's a wedding manager, Ms. Shaanu. She can find a match for any girl, at a nominal cost. The lady who runs Saubhagyashaali Wedding? Yes, her. With the tagline - 'Your daughter, my headache'? Correct. - Do you know of her? - Of course. She has called us so many times to cater at weddings. - And what did you say? - I refused. We don't have time for all this, Lala! Such an intelligent boy. Listen... hand me my slippers. I told her, we don't cater at weddings... it's through us that the Lord blesses pregnant women. Where to? Idiot...You've kept me from meeting this amazing lady! Did you forget? We have four sisters... Sapna, we have to meet this lady tomorrow and take her help. Okay? What is it? When you looked at me I fell in love I fell madly in love Sapna... this Undertaker is Chandramukhi. If Ms. Shaanu can find a match for her, she'll find someone for my sisters as well. Gaffar deserved a thrashing. Ms. Chandramukhi... where's your father? I think that's Ms. Shaanu. Madam, I am Lala Kedarnath Agarwal. Take this. She is my fianc*e... And... She is Sapna. We've come from very far, with a request. I have a shop nearby - 'Premlata Chaat Bhandar'. But you said you've come from far. Actually, the shop is nearby... But the request is a far-fetched one. What's the name of your shop? 'Premlata Chaat Bhandar' Oh, I see... - you're that pompous Kedarnath. - No, ma'am. How could he possibly be pompous with four unmarried sisters... There's a stupid boy who works at the shop, he didn't recognize you. We'll set up a stall wherever you want. Isn't it, Kedara? I have four sisters... I can't get married until they do. If I don't get married, nor can she. Correct. All our lives will get ruined. See... Later, child. It's not a big deal for you. - I need four grooms. - Move aside. Please see if you could help... nothing too expensive... Wait... - I'll try. - Please, listen... Hold her. Kids, be careful! - Listen... - Yes? Are you free tomorrow evening? Er... I'll work something out. I'm not asking you out on a date only to cater at an event. Of course, I can... Send me the address, I'll be there. Bring your sisters with you. Sure. Good night. I won't give you money. Do you want an ice cream? Hello? - Have you reached? - Yes, we're at the entrance. Why can't I see you? - Where? - There he is. Yes. Come here. Take a look at them. Why are you three dressed like this? Why? Don't we look good? 'Look good'? Rubbish. She's looking like a clown. Go, stand with those clowns over there. And you... why are you wearing a chessboard? Go, stand in that corner. Your multi-colored dress... looks like someone has spat on it! Come on, we're looking good. Why don't you introduce us to Ms. Shaanu. You want to meet Ms. Shaanu? Want to ruin her business? Silly girl... Go, make yourselves scarce. Gayatri, come with me. You too, Sapna. My son had told you, he wants an expensive car. Why are you arguing about this now? You're absolutely right. It's a national holiday today, that's why the car wasn't delivered today. But I've already booked the car, sent you the papers as well. Just hear his excuse... Since Mr. Uppal has sent us the papers, he's suggesting... we make a paper boat with those papers... and take our son home in that! Mr. Uppal, after all... a deal is a deal. Papa, I've told my friends I'll bring my wife home in an expensive car! Sir, listen to me. This man is requesting you with folded hands... it's a national holiday, the car showroom is closed today, You'll get your car tomorrow! Really... you're being too greedy. What did you just say? Greedy? Are you calling me greedy? No, sir. She didn't mean it like that. I don't care, Mr. Uppal. Gaffar, that man who'd come with sweets... after having a son... - Doesn't he own Rastogi Trading? - Yes... call him. Now? Either get the car right now or get this woman to apologize! Really? Mr. Rastogi, thank you for helping us at this hour. The money... Take the car... we'll discuss this later. - Thank you so much. - No need to thank me. After three daughters... thanks to your golgappas, I finally have an heir. Take the keys... go. Let them call off the wedding. My name is Shaanu. I don't apologize to anyone and definitely not to them. Please, Ms. Shaanu... apologize to them. Else they'll call off the wedding. Why are you so worried? Let them leave. I'll find other grooms for your daughter. Don't worry, I'll do something. Let's leave! Angad, bro... Here's your brand new car. Look, the car is here! It's yours! Take it away. Here's the duplicate key. - God bless you! - Never mind. Let the celebrations begin! Ms. Shaanu, I am always there to help you. You don't need to apologize to them. They wanted a car, they've got it ...look at those fools dance. Thank you. Well done, Lala. Here you put in so much effort all I get are excuses. I'm not even asking for a car. Gift me a bangle and I'm yours. I've given you my heart My love. More precious than my life Is your acceptance of my love Like a silken thread... I will gift you a ruby bangle, my love I will gift you a ruby bangle, my love Your beautiful smile Makes me fall in love with you You are what I desire Say you'll be mine Like a silken thread... I will gift you a ruby bangle, my love You bring love and light Wherever you go You spread beauty All around I can lay down my life for you You are magic I can lay down my life for you You are my true love I declare to the world You are my destiny Like a silken thread... I will gift you a ruby bangle, my love I will gift you a ruby bangle, my love That's dog food. Ms. Shaanu, I have four sisters to wed... I deserve a discount. Come on... I've already given you a discount. 20 lakhs include the dowry and my commission. 20 lakhs per wedding is too much. With the variety that you've brought... this gangster-girl... this pitch-dark one... this double-decker... I deserve twice the commission. Consider this... 20 lakhs per girl... adds up to a total of 80 lakhs. I'll need another 10 lakhs for the wedding arrangements-- Fine. I'll work something out. I'll get her married first for 18 lakhs. Alright? But you'll have to work on the others. Stop her from eating. Stop her from going out in the sun. And this one... Van Damme... We'll have to turn her into 'Damn Hot'. Sorry. - Sapna? - Yes. - Aren't you Harishankar's daughter? - Yes. Why are you wasting your time here? Go and get ready... there's a boy coming to meet you in two days. I've arranged the match. What? I'm the boy she's marrying. She pesters me to marry her. Who asked you to find a match for her? Her father did. He wants her to get married before he retires. He has already paid my fees. - Oh, she's an unfaithful one! - Oh, she's an unfaithful one! - She didn't really love you - She didn't really love you Keep quiet! ...I can save 15 lakhs. It adds up to 60 lakhs... Stop mumbling to yourself, Lala. Look at these account books. See if you've inherited... a house, shop or even a brothel that you can sell. 'Brothel'? This is an antique chair, sister-in-law. Should sell for five thousand. If I sell you along with this chair, it'll still not sell for five thousand! - This fool wants to sell a chair! - One minute... Why would my ancestors buy a brothel? Lala, sell these too! You... Get lost! Sister-in-law... we'll get two thousand at least for this. Keep it back! I got this tailored for him to wear at our wedding. How dare you touch it! It's been eight years already. It's an antique now... sell it. You know what, Lala... your sisters don't want us to get married. What do you want? Want me to wear this? Fine. I'll wear this sherwani. Happy? Wear this and sit at home for the next 20 years. I don't care. Tell me, when are we getting married? As soon as my sisters get married, so will we. Getting these girls married?! These girls? All the girls in the city will get married but not them not them because they don't want to get married! Don't say that, Sapna. They're my sisters not strangers. you're only concerned about your sisters. I've been waiting to marry you since we were kids... but you're only concerned about your sisters. Sapna... don't cry. Go away. She'll go on a diet from tomorrow. You'll eat just one leaf from tomorrow. One leaf! Laxmi, you'll marinate yourself in fairness cream! Get it? I'll make sure she becomes fair-skinned. And... this girl is perfect! And she'll be a child-bride! Happy? Please don't cry. Excuse me, Mr. Lala... I love my body. Big is beautiful. I love the color of my skin. Black is back! Mark my words, Lala. These girls don't want to get married. They only want to pout and take photos for Instagram. What gram? Irritating man! You just stand here and do nothing! We can't get married because of these witches. I'll go and marry that other boy. I'll agree to marry him. You carry on with this nonsense. Sapna... Let go! Sapna! Are you happy now, you witches? Happy now? Got what you wanted? Lala, what will we get for this? Shit. Want to eat it? Who eats shit? You... sell me instead! Just see. We won't get anything if we sell you... selling your kidney might fetch a few hundred-- Shut up! It's just a suggestion. Lala... wait up. Stop laughing, all of you. This is a serious matter. We'll have to handle Sapna's problem... I'll take the lead now. Get it? Sir... please have some snacks. You haven't eaten any... - try some, they're delicious. - Sure. Mr. Harishankar, I see you're serving snacks to your guests. Send some over to us as well. Sapna is our sister-in-law after all! Namaste, sister-in-law. I'm here, you dog. So? This is not enough. Exactly, this is not enough. Lala, go and speak to the people you're paying the EMIs to... the bank. Ask them to either forego the money or to lend you some more. Sit. These girls are a nuisance. She's not their sister-in-law. Lala and she are childhood friends. Friends! Sure! I've seen them play 'doctor-patient' as kids. She's lying. Harishankar, a man and a woman can never be friends. It's a facade... for what goes on in their pulsating bodies on hot, steamy nights. What rubbish are you saying? - 'Pulsating bodies'? - 'Hot, steamy nights'? What rubbish. This is a line from a film, sir. - I'll give you a tight slap! - Really? Please do something, Mr. Dua. If you can't give me a loan, pause the repayment of the old one for some time. Come on, Lala. It's not possible. Tell you what. You should run away. Go and start your life afresh. You think he'll help if you're so casual? Rubbish. Look sad, broken from inside... like a dead man. Yes. Like this! And add some... tears. What is she doing? If you marry our sister-in-law, take our brother along too. He'll sleep between these two. If you separate childhood lovers, you'll burn in hell, you rascal. What nonsense! Do you even realize what you're saying? Kedara, only if your mortgage your shop can I give you money. I can't give you any money for this. Leave. Keep this back. Get anything? Nothing. It didn't work. How insulting! It's not what you think... - Let's go. - Mr. Dinanath... - So insulting... - Madam... Move. What have you done?! Just wait and watch what I do. Get lost, Harishankar. I don't care. I'll teach them a lesson. - Forget it, Papa. - The entire family is crazy. You were awesome! What was that? Our Gayatri is unstoppable. Nobody tell Brother about this. Hurry up, let's go home. [singing devotional songs] Gaffar, what're you waiting for? Get the yoghurt. Hello... do you have any idea how much this guy makes by singing at these gatherings? How much? One lakh. - One lakh? - That too in five hours. How much do we make, serving chaat to hundreds of people? Only 20 thousand. Think about it, Lala. Don't waste your time. Brother... Your work is done. We drove that boy's family away. The ones who'd come to meet Sapna. Come on, smile. If you serve chaat with this expression, they'll surely fall sick. Don't worry, Brother. They will work hard on themselves to get married. Durga goes on a diet from tomorrow. We'll try and improve her complexion... and we'll fix her somehow. You just relax. As for me, I love my body... but I'll do it for you. Let's eat golagappas to celebrate. [singing devotional songs] Get ready, Gaffar. We'll serve them chaat and entertain them as well. Morning and evening I sing your praises Morning and evening I sing your praises Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers I've prayed countless times" But I've been disappointed so far" Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers Consider my case And grant my wish Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers I'm not asking for the impossible It's not something you can't do All I ask for is to be pretty and slim Make me hot as well Give me your blessings I'm here to ask for your help Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers Your photo is my Insta DP I sing your praises With much fanfare You and I both know I'm your biggest follower Please answer my prayers Please answer my prayers Dowry is a social crime. It is the bane of every woman's life. And it is because of this custom, - people aren't happy at the birth of a daughter - Be quiet... while the birth of a son is celebrated. This is why daughters are neglected... Who is this woman? Why isn't she letting me sleep? Is she crazy? - ...they're seen as a burden. - Lala, she's here every month... - ...second Monday of every month. - From the moment she's born, - ...her father is burdened with. - with the same anti-dowry speech. Both, taking dowry and giving dowry is a crime. I've explained this to you earlier but I've found out, dowry was given in Chandramukhi's wedding. You should be ashamed of yourselves. We have to stop this custom. Well said, madam. Do you have children, madam? - I do. - How many? - Two. - Boys? Or girls? Two girls. Two girls, that's why you're against the custom of giving dowry. If you had two boys... your opinion would've been different. Of course a girl's mother will say that giving dowry is bad. If it was a boy's mother saying this, I'd take it seriously. Am I right? I have four sisters, madam. I'm breaking my back for their dowry. We haven't started this custom anyway. It's been going on for generations that's why we're continuing with it. Shouldn't this change? Who will bring about the change? You? With your speeches here? This is Chandni Chowk, madam. Chandni Chowk. A mini India. Every house here has a daughter whose dowry is falling short. But hoping to give them a lavish wedding their families slave away. Now you want them to be ashamed of their hard work? Madam, every man standing here... is working tirelessly so that he can give his daughter a lavish wedding. You want us to be ashamed of this? We won't. We love our sisters and daughters dearly. We can lay down our lives for them. See how much I've managed to put together... a flat-screen TV, washing machine, microwave, cupboard, sofa, double-bed-- Lala... it's Shaanu. - Hello... - Hello, Lala? What are you doing? Do it properly. I want to speak to you. Reach my office in ten minutes. I'll be there soon. What happened? Are you sleepy? Welcome, Lala. Your sister is getting married on the 27th of next month. Start the wedding preparations. My sister? Bless you. Thank you so much.
