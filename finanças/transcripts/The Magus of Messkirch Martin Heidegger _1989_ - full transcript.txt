Philosophy today - You claimed that Heidegger realized that his theory had been wrong.. Heidegger is probably the most important philosopher of this century. But definitely the most controversial... because he came to an agreement with the National Socialism. Mrs Dormin's question was: I said, she claimed that Heidegger got so upset about R?hm because he realized that his expectations regarding the intellectual renewal of Europe were a mistake. So how come he didn't get upset about the extermination camps that were so much worse and so incredibly shameful for us? My reply was: He was so upset that he couldn't even open his mouth about it. Heidegger became a political issue. After the historians' debate, now the Heidegger debate. The most important thing is imminent to fall by the wayside: Heidegger's philosophy. Given that it still has something to tell us, should it still allowed to tell us something? Hannah Arendt in 1969 on Heidegger: "The storm that passes through Heidegger's thinking does not arise in this century. It arises in the age-old and what it leaves behind is something complete, which like everything complete returns to the age-old." Here lived the philospher Martin Heidegger. THE MAGICIAN OF MESSKIRCH Everysince the philospher's 80th birthday the repertoire of the brass band of Messkirch includes a "Heidegger march". That a prophet is not honoured in his own country, seems to be untrue in Messkirch, where Heidegger was born in 1889. Martin grew up in the face of the powerful catholic church, where his father worked as a sacristan. He rang the bells, the church kept an eye on him and encouraged him. Martin was supposed to become a priest. But he wants to go out into the open, on the square between the cowered house and the church. Later he'll call it "the clearing". Also his thinking will be opening, leading out of the granted and therfore out of the homely. His passion was asking questions, not giving answers. - Mr Professor, for decades you've reflected on the essence of man. What insights did you gain? - The key experience of my thinking and that means also for Western philosophy, the reflection on the history of Western thinking, has shown me that one question had never been asked: namely the question of Being. And this question is of importance because in Western thinking we define the essence of man as relating to Being and existing by corresponding to Being. That means by corresponding, man is the creature that has language. And in contrast to buddhistic teachings, western thinking draws an essential distinction between man and the other creatures, animals and plants. Man is characterized by language, that means by bearing an aware reference to Being. And this question of Being hasn't been asked in the hitherto history of western thinking, or to be more precisely: In this regard, Being itself has been hidden so far from man. And that's why in my opinion this question has to be asked now in order to also find out what and who man is. One gets closer to someone if one knows where he's from. Messkirch is a small town on the Swabian Alp, between Lake Constance and upper Danube; a meager, formerly poor region on the border between the Alemannic and the Swabian. The Alemannic temperament is rather cumbrous, subtle, but also contemplative. The Swabian one is more cheerful and open, but also sly. Heidegger has some of both. Memories at the regulars' table at an inn in Messkirch: - Whenever he was here, he was easily recognizable. He was always wearing his brown coat and his round cap. He was never to be seen in something else, as long as i can recall. - I can still remember how he told me.. He stayed at his brother's whenever he was in Messkirch. So once he walked along the "Grabenstra?e" when Emma Brunner turned up, you all knew her.. Well nowadays you'd call her the "pearl", back then we said charwoman. I only knew her with a pinafore and two buckets. So she went down the street and Heidegger walked behind her and they actually went to school together. So she was thinking, how should i address my famous classmate? We just say: "You're also here?" But she thought, no i can't do that... So she said, Martin used to tell that story every now and then: "So you are here aswell?" But you are the oldest, most known person in Messkirch who still knew Heidegger. - Yes yes, i am the oldest... - Yes, as former mayor or not. - Yes, i knew him. When i was still mayor and even as a boy. My parents, my father once gave me a sabre, about this long. Usually they're longer. But itt was made of steel, not of sheet. And the sheath was solid aswell.. with laces for hanging. Sometimes he played with it, he was the captain then. Heidegger had a younger brother, Fritz Heidegger, here talking to his cousin. Fritz stayed all his life in Messkirch. - At school he was always the boldest and smartest. But he was still little and the others didn't have any real respect. Did Fritz, the banker and solo entertainer in pubs in Messkirch, ever philosophize with his brother? - I even gave him advice sometimes. - What about? - Well not much stuff, that's... - I mean what in particular? - Well, for example when collating. Every now and then I said something. Sometimes he had put several truths into a single sentence. Then I said: "Martin, you can?t do that, you have to divide this!" Fritz typewrote 30.000 pages of manuscript for his brother and kept it in a bank safe. Disaster-proof as he hoped. Martin dedicated one of his to him: "For my only brother". The brothers in a video recording, kept in the private archive of the Heidegger family. - He came again 8 days before my mother?s death and brought her an annotated copy, a very special binding of "Being and Time" and put it on her deathbed. The Heideggers have been living in the Messkirch region for generations. Their ancestors were little people, craftsmen, farmers. His parents and the church had bigger plans for Martin. Martin was a good student, it seemed like he didn't even need to make an effort. Therefore he only recieved hushed praise in his academic reviews. But already as a little boy he got a key role in the church history of Messkirch. - During the last century the church had to be left for usage to the Old Catholics for two decades. But on December 1, 1895 it was handed back. Here at this history-charged place the then-sacristan handed this key over to the 6 year old Martin Heidegger, son of a sacristan. Martin Heidegger usually returned in autumn, at the time of the feast of St. Martin on 11.11. to Messkirch. Then he took part in the festivities here in the church and every now and then he sat down in his old ancestral seat in the choir stalls where he used to sit as altar boy. Very early Martin wanted to leave something lasting. He cut his initials into the wood of the church gallery. Martin is first sent to the catholic course of lectures in Constance and then to Fribourg where he at first studies theology in 1911 and afterwards philosophy and mathematics. During his holidays he always returns to Messkirch. Until old age he keeps his ritual: The walk on the field path from gate of the castle's courtgarden to a bench and further. "Itinerant in thinking" he calls this later. Itinerant but without a goal, in motion but unhurried. The field path became an unforgettable symbole to him. "From the field cross it bends towards the forest. Past its edge it greets a tall oak under which a roughly timbered bench stands." - Martin Heidegger reads from "The Fieldpath" - "On it lay occasionally one or another writing of the great thinkers which a young unwieldiness tried to decipher. Whenever the riddles pressed upon each other and no way out was in sight, the field path helped. The vastness of all grown things which dwell around the field path bestows the world. It is only in the unspoken of their language that - as the old master of philosophy and life, Eckhart says - God is God. But the message of the field path speaks only as long as there are human beings who, born in its air, are able to hear it. They are slaves of their origin, but not servants of machinations. Man in vain attempts to put the globe in order through his planning, if he is not subordinate to the message of the field path. So man becomes absentminded and pathless. To the absentminded the simple seems monotonous. The simple has escaped. Its silent power is exhausted." During World War I a whole generation got to know an experience which Heidegger will later call in his chief work: the throwness of existence. Thrown to the war front; used as fuel in the battles; fallen from the sky; Heidegger was lucky, he survived. He returned to his desk in Fribourg from short combar missions. In the meantime he got married, to a protestant woman. This wan't liked much by Heidegger's catholic milieu. He didn't return to the scholastic subjects of his dissertation and state doctorate. No longer he defined himself as a catholic philosopher. Edmund Husserl put him on the track of the everyday adventure of our Being-in-the-World. Since 1923 Heidegger teaches in Marburg; students start gathering around him; in youthful anti-bourgeoisie and with the passion of a new start. Rumors spoke of the secret king of philosophy in Germany, a king dressed in Swabian loden. Some that came to him, got renowned later on. - During the year when I was not yet with Heidegger, our circle contained these F?rtha people; there was a local group in Marburg for the F?rtha movement. They had a table in the canteen and everyone stopped talking whenever at the next table a very strikingly dressed young woman, a student - very attractive, was speaking. Everybody was listening. Only later i got to know that she had been Hannah Arendt, who at that time had a relationship with Heidegger and loved him. - Did he love her aswell? - That i do not know. In complete secrecy Heidegger visited his student Hannah Arendt in her tiny room under the roof. Of course she wrote him poems. After a few months Hannah Arendt left Heidegger, that's how he wanted it. Nothing incalculable and irrevocable should happen. Hannah Arendt said later, that the encouter with Heidegger had helped her discovering herself and her world. She went to Karl Jaspers in Heidelberg. Jaspers felt at the same time attracted to and repelled from Heidegger. Jaspers on Heidegger in 1949: "Among the coevals the most thrilling thinker: imperious, compellent, mysterious. But then again empty, disengaging." When Jaspers died in 1969, his notes about Heidegger lay like all the years before ready to hand on his desk. Heidegger's "Being and Time" was published in 1927. The work is dedicated to Husserl who was later ostracised by the Nazis. In 1938 Heidegger withdraws the dedication on the front cover on request of the publisher. But the dadication in the text stays. "Being and Time " was considered immediatly as an epoch-making work. In it one could feels a passionate thinking that anwered to the challenges of modernity. Heidegger refers to experiences of everyday life. In the 1920s, those experiences are mainly experiences of crises. Because just like Nietzsche predicted, the revaluation of all values took place in the meantime. The value that governs all other values in life, is money. Human relationships and fates depend on it. The whole life of man should be expressable as monetary value. So if money itself becomes a victim of inflation, also life gets worthless. Heidegger analyses how this worthlessness of life could happen in the first place. He goes back to the existential base situation. Man has to act according to his Being. He can also run away from himself, into the inflationary gear of public opinion for example. Everyone is just like the others and noone is oneself. That's what Heidegger calls the non-authenticity, the "one". In this everyday scenery of non-authenticity, affected by the engineered mass society, Heidegger asks his mysterious question of the Being of the essent. We are oblivious of Being, says Heidegger. That's why we escape into distraction, but we can't escape our fate. We're dancing on top of the volcano. What is that... "Being"? "Being" is no object that can be looked at from the outside. We experience it in the moods, in particular in the mood of fear. Fear looks into the abyss of nothingness and fear can be astonished that anything exists at all. We come from the nothingness and go into the nothingness. We are a finite event of Being. Through the resolution of our own finiteness, Being makes itself accessible to us, which we are ourselves. Heidegger calls this resolution "authenticity". Authenticity is the courage to Be. Heidegger speaks of this with heroic and culture-criticizing undertones. But what's the sense of Being? - Well, the sense is not something entirely different from pure Being, like a value or some other aspect that has to be added; but Being in its own directionality. It's best illustrated if you think of the German expression "a movement in the sense of the clock hand". (clockwise) Here "sense" doesn't mean anything different than the direction in which the clock hand is moving. Not the opposite direction, but this direction. And so time in the sense of being born and dying, this movement of time between birth and death is itself the movement or the path or the sense of the duration of our existence in time. Heidegger quotes in "Being and Time" the medieval poet whose poetry is known as "Ploughman of Bohemia". In it death tells the ploughman: "As soon as a man is born into this world, he's old enough to die." This is the happening of an existence between birth and death. Death enters Heidegger's philosophy because it's part of life, of Being, from the start. So not just the "last hour" or certain manners of death that have to be fought, but appendant death that belongs to life like the valley to the mountain. The word mountain wouldn't have any meaning without the word valley and so the word existence, life has no meaning without the affiliation of death. In this sense is the temporality between birth and death the expression for the sense of our existence itself. In 1923 Heidegger had built himself a hut in Todtnauberg, southern Black Forest. There and in the farmhouse on the hillside he wrote "Being and Time". Heidegger seeked silence in the hut, but he also received visitors. For his students, Todtnauberg turned almost into a place of pilgrimage. One had to ascend to him, was allowed to get water, cut wood and above all ski with him. One of his guests kept a diary. Hermann M?rchen wrote this unpublished note about the turn of the year of 1931/32: "The reception was friendly and calm, we arrived just at lunchtime. In the afternoon we went out for skiing and Heidegger gave us the first instructions. One sleeps very extensively up there, at 8:30 pm is already sleeping time. Yet in winter it's long enough dark to have some time for chats; of course we didn't talk about philosophy, but above all about the National Socialism. The formerly liberal devotee Gertrud B?umers became a national socialist and her husband follows her. I didn't expect it. And yet it's actually not very surprising. He doesn't know much about politics and it seems that it's mainly his dislike of all mediocre half measures that makes him expect something of this party which promises to do something determined and by doing so counter communism effectively. Democratic idealism and Br?ningesque preciseness can't change anything where things came to this point. Therefore nowadays a dictatorship that doesn't shy at Boxheimer means, has to be approved. Only through such a dictatorship can the worse one, the communistic one, that would destroy all culture of individual personality and therefore all western culture in general, be avoided. He doesn't seem to think about single political questions. Who lives up here, sets different standards for all those things.. Never before we got to know him as privately as here, where he acts very naturally and doesn't have anything tense and cool about him. Heidegger was unpolitical, but during the mood of crisis in the early 30's his thinking about authenticity and non-authenticity turns political and against the parliamentary democracy that he counts among the field of the non-authentic and weak. He's attracted by the anti-bourgeoisie, the revolutionary, the unwillingness to compromise. He thinks nothing of the rationality of majority decisions. Heidegger had talked about resolution in his philosophy. It refered to the individual that wants his existence. Now he applies this resolution to a whole nation, that should want its existence. And that can only happen if there's someone who drags the others along, a leader figure in which a common will gains charismatic shape. Through the federal youth movement he's familiar with the leader myth and also his philosophy contains an authoritative manner. He once said: "When everything collapses, that is the great time of philosophy." The philosopher of the venterous existence, the philosopher of Being and of nothingness needs a catastrophe. And that's why Heidegger, like the majority of intellectuals at the time, belongs to the gravediggers of the Weimar democracy. And that's why he considers a collapse as the only chance for a new start. And that's why he lets himself be elected rector of the University of Fribourg shortly after the national socialist takeover. That was a great public act of partisanship towards the Nationals Socialism. But Heidegger had made up his own private National Socialism; without racism and biologism. National Socialism meant to him resolute action, instead of irresponsible talk; a national community instead of an anonymous competitive society; the reestablishment of the Ancient Greek science ethos instead of scientific one-track specialisation. Was Heidegger pushed into rectorship or did he push himself forward? - The prehistory of Heidegger's candidature definitely permits the conclusion that Heidegger was pushed into rectorship. Which doesn't exclude that Heidegger wanted to have an indirect impact on the political circumstances through the university. - I'll read from the directorate's speech, which was given here in this auditorium. High-ranking national socialists are sitting here, official representatives; the national socialist revolution was taking place in the streets and in parliament, partially with gory terror. And here Heidegger stands and announces an apparent upheavel in philosophy. And speaks sentences like: "And the intellectual world of a nation is not the superstructure of a culture, but it's the power of the innermost preservation of earthly and bloodly strength as the power of the innermost excitement and farthest tremor of its existence." Or he says that "the first bond is the one into the national community." - Well, the sentence you quoted first is immediately neutralized by the one that follows. It says: "An intellectual world alone forfeits a nation's greatness." Of course Heidegger later on rejects the thought of blood and race. Heidegger says: "Every leadership has to grant its followers their own strength. But every act of obedience carries resistance. This polarity between leading and obeying must neither be blurred, nor eliminated." One has to realize that this is his definition of leading and obeying. And that this definition of obedience, with the terms strengh and resistance, is in direct contrast to the national socialist definition of this relationship. - Did the national socialists notice this discrepancy, if it was one? - At first they overlooked it. Although right after Heidegger's speech, it was critizised by the national socialists. The minister himself, Wacker, critizised the directorate's speech a lot, not because of the quote, but because basic elements of the national socialist world view were missing, like race. Nevertheless one has to admit that it was the most subtle speech and Heidegger's opposition towards the national socialist world view was overheard at first. Indeed, a newspaper article from 1934 shows: They used Heidegger's prestige and ignored his private national socialism. After his retirement from rectorship in 1934 the ministry thanked him for pervading the university with the national socialist spirit. Also a book by Victor Farias deals with the subject "Heidegger and the National Socialism"; it caused a big stir in France and by now got published also in Germany. According to the Chilean Farias, who was driven into exile by Pinochet's dictatorship, Heidegger's national socialist commitment wasn't only an episode. He doesn't see any signs that Heidegger really turned his back to the National Socialism. - Of course Heidegger's critisism is very sharp and firm, for example in his lectures on Nietzsche, against the official thinkers of the National Socialism, meaning the people that had won the fight against the other faction. But on the other hand Heidegger thought of himself as the true national socialist and Rosenberg and the others as the false one, as those who wanted to define a wonderful metaphysical factum like the German nation through biological categories. On the other hand there are reports, also by Karl Jaspers, that Heidegger started those lectures with the Hitler salute. And that although in 1936 the Hitler salute had been abolished in the University of Marburg, he tried in 1938 to reestablish this salute. Especially during his lectures abroad Heidegger wears the party badge. Farias doesn't want to accept Heidegger's private National Socialism as a discharge. - Every attempt to join a movement with one's own head is a private attempt. So he couldn't start a mass attempt, he was only one, but he was a great "one", like the "one" of Heraclid or Permedines. And what he did is indeed a kind of existential heroic suggestion to give this movement a philosophical foundation. In this sense he remained loyal, and not only during the national socialist period but according to my interpretation also afterwards. The Document Center in Berlin keeps Heidegger's personnel file. It reveils: Heidegger joined the NSDAP on May 1, 1933 and stayed a member of the party until the end. He always paid his fees on time. He had opponents within the party, for example Rosenberg resent him for abolishing racism and biologism. Also the state security service was suspicious, they sent spies to Heidegger's lectures. But Heidegger also had friends within the party. He was granted a research semester in 1943, because the application of the philosophical faculty in Fribourg says that "through more publications by Heidegger, the status of the German spirit in the world would experience a significant fortification and boost." The chapter "Heidegger and the National Socialism" won't be closed for a long time. Also because Heidegger himself didn't contribute much to its clarification in public. Like in the famous interview with "Spiegel" in 1966. It lacks words of shame and horror. In letters and private conversations that was different. - We spoke very frankly about it, although as a younger person one gets into difficulties, because today it's very hard to understand that time. I had a second, in my opinion just as important teacher, Ernst Bloch and Ernst Bloch got involved in other directions aswell. He thought that Moskow was the new Jerusalem and that Stalin was the reincarnation of a new Jesus Christ. So for us the question was always about the involvement in a particular period of time. There were clear-sighted, farsighted analysts like Thomas Mann that knew exactly where things went. But Heidegger stood rather offside of all the political debates, then he got more or less pushed into this rectorship and thought he could now realize his vision of a reformation of the University of Fribourg. It was very naive... But he realized that very quick and retired and focused on his philosophical work. All the important people gathered in the Auditorium Maximum. Party uniforms, uniforms of all kinds, and I think the students were in the minority. Then Heidegger entered, had to pave his way to the lectern and stood up there and began, chanting every word: "I read logic." ? That?s how I remember it! - "I read logic, logic comes from logos. So said Heraclid." It was immediately clear to me that the change in subject was a renunciation from the political intrigues. And that he, the thinker reclaimed his very own work. "Why do we stay in the province?" Under this headline in a newspaper article from 1934 Heidegger explains why he rejected the call from the Berlin University in 1933. It was the refusal to become a political philosopher in a national socialist metropolis. In the article he declares the province the proper place of philosophy. But at the same time he distances himself from the "the false talk of the writers about folklore and solidity." After 1934 Heidegger withdraws from practical philosophy. But his thinking remains political. Its subject is now nihilism. "The desert grows." said Nietzsche. In his lecture on Nietzsche in 1937 Heidegger asked for the origin of a power-mindedness that brings the devastation. Indirectly it's also a clearance of his own power trip. And yet to him national socialism is only an episode in a longlasting process of devastation through the power-mindedness. He blaims his general process and not the criminal policy of the Nazis in particular for the war. And that's why even in 1934 he can still say that Germany as the heart of the Occident has to be defended against Bolshevism and Americanism. Heidegger in his lecture on Heraclid in 1943: "The planet is on fire. The essence of man is going to pieces. Only from the Germans can derive the world-historic consciousness, if they find and preserve the German essence." At this point of time the Nazis don't represent for him anymore that German essence from which the consciousness is supposed to derive. In the Nazis he saw the most brutal expression of the will to power. He explains in 1943: "The value-thinking of metaphysics of the will to power is in an outmost sense deadly." This is spoken against the National Socialism. This took courage. But he didn't have the courage to leave the party of the crime. He remains indirectly responsible for what happened when the national socialist drew the most cruel consequences from the will to power. Heidegger in a letter to Karl Jaspers in 1950: "I was dreaming and was basically only thinking about the university i had in mind. What i tell you can't excuse anything. It can only explain how from year to year, when evil emerged, also my shame increased, of contributing to this directly and indirectly." In November 1944 Heidegger was recruited for the home guard. There was disagreement at the NS-office. Some wanted to get rid of the philosopher, others wanted to protect him. Men work for survival. Heidegger gets permission to collect his manuscripts and move them to a safe place. In late 1944 Fribourg relocates its central facilities to safer retreat areas, amongst them the university. The philosophical faculty moves with 20 students and 10 professors, amongst them Martin Heidegger, to the idyllic upper Danube valley; to Beuron and up to Wildenstein castle. This is Heideggers region. Messkirch is near. The Heideggers lived at the foot of Wildenstein castle in the 18th century. While the surrounding towns were reduced to ashes, Heidegger is occupied with the essence of the artwork. Language is the house of Being, he teaches. He delves into H?lderlin, who sung about the upper Danube in the Ister hymn. "Now come, fire! Eager are we To see the day, And when the trial Has passed through our knees, May someone sense the forest's cry. Here, however, we wish to build. For rivers make arable the land. This one, however, is called the Ister. Beautifully he lives. The pillars' foliage burns, and stirs. Wildly they stand supporting one another; above, a second measure, juts out the roof of rocks." Through H?lderlin Heidegger asks: How did we end up in foreign places? How can we get back home? On June 27, 1945 Heidegger gives a speech about H?lderlin at Werenwag castle. For many years his last official appearance. Because back in Fribourg he was classified a Nazi by a "clean up" committee and banned from teaching ...until 1951. Heidegger's post war philosophy resumes the criticism of power-mindedness. The activist and heroic undertones of the philosophy of the 20's vanish. The focus is put on another way of correspoding to Being: equanimity. Equanimity is a reply to the unavailability of Being. Heidegger finds his Tao. Letting be what lets us be. He tries to translate Laotse. His philosophy orbits with growing intensity around the problem of technology, more precisely the problem that man gets more and more like the instruments he produces, the problem of man's self-instrumentalisation. - Well, first is to say that I am not against technology. I have never spoken against technology, neither about the so-called demonic side of technology; instead I try to understand the essence of technology. By quoting this thought about the dangerousness of the atomic bomb and an even greater dangerousness of technology, I think of what is now developing as biophysics, that in the foreseeable future we?ll be able to construct man, that is in his purely organic essence, as needed. Skillful and clumsy, smart and stupid ones. It will come to that. The technical options are nowadays available and were mentioned by Nobel Prize winners at a conference in Lindau, what I cited in a lecture already years ago in Messkirch. So especially the misunderstanding has to be rejected, as if I was against technology. On the contrary, I see in the essence of technology that man is under a power that challenges him and opposite which he?s no longer free. That something is announced, namely a reference of Being to man and that this reference, hidden within the essence of technology, will perhaps one day come to light in its unconcealment. Whether that will happen, I do not know. So I see in the essence of technology the first glimpse of a much deeper occurrence, which I call the event. Heidegger avoids the public as much as possible. He retires to his hut in Todtnauberg. It was Heidegger's wish that after his death the hut remains closed to the public. So only souvenir pictures provide a glimpse on the inside of the hut. A video from the private archive of the Heidegger family, one of the philosopher's birthday parties in Todtnauberg. Farmers from the are come to congratulate. Stagings are part of great philosophy. Diogenes for example didn't leave behind one single line, but only the staging of his life as philosophy. And also the hut in Todtnauberg is not just life-form, it's also a deeply symbolic staging which is supposed to give pause for thought. Doesn't a knowledge flow here from an archaic spring? The hut, doesn't it stand close to the forgotten origin? Are we close to the simple things here? Does the herdsman of Being live here? Or is Todtnauberg also a philosophical general? In any case is the hut a kind of reserve. Heidegger in 1959: "Today the real thinking that explores the record of Being, only lives in reservations." Heidegger differs this explorative thinking from any science. This differentiation caused his students and critics a lot of headache. - About the sentence with the headaches, I think that is quite healthy. There?s still too little headache in today?s world, instead there?s a great unthoughtfulness that is linked to the oblivion of Being. And this sentence: "Science does not think." which caused quite a stir when I uttered it in a lecture in Freiburg means that science does not move in the dimension of philosophy. But without knowing, it relies on this dimension. For example, physics moves in the field of space and time and motion. What motion, what space, what time are, can?t be decided by this science as a science. Therefore science does not think, that means it can?t even think in the sense of the word, with its methods. I can?t, for example physically or by physical methods say what physics is. What physics is, I can only tell by thinking, philosophising. The sentence "Science does not think." is not a criticism. It?s just a statement of the internal structure of science, which is part of its essence, that on the one hand it relies on what philosophy thinks, forgets and disregards this fact though on the other hand. Did Heidegger's thoughts about science have any influence on scientists? - I think one has to admit that there is no direct effect of Heidegger's thinking on contemporary science. But i also think that this shouldn't be too surprising because the relationship between science and philosophy seems to be something like this: Heidegger occasionally said, and he upset scientist by doing so, but he said something very important: science does not think. That means that unlike philosophy, science doesn't doubt, question its own preconditions. That's what he means here. And a science that doesn't question its own preconditions will of course not be influenced by a philosophy that does. But acutally it's a fact that whereever modern science and all science in general takes really big steps, it does exactly that: it thinks. And does so in the sense of Heidegger, namely by questioning its own preconditions. It's what happened in the theory of relativity and in the quantum theory in our century. But this happened without any influence of Heidegger, but not without any influence of philosophy. In 1955 Martin Heidegger is asked to give a commemorative speech on his compatriot the composer Konradin Kreuzer; but he doesn't speak about the composer. Under the headline "Man in the Atomic Age" he speaks about equanimity, the great subject of his late philosophy. - We can make use of technical objects but at the same time, while using them appropriately, we can keep enough distance let them go at any time. We can make use of technical objects in the way that they have to be used, but we can also let these objects be, as something that doesn't regard us in its innermost. Our relationship to the technical world becomes simple and quiet in a wondrous manner. We let technical objects enter our daily world and keep them out at the same time, meaning we let them stay things that are nothing absolute but remain dependent on something superior. I want to name this attitude of the simultaneous Yes and No towards the technical world with one term: the equanimity towards things. Such equanimity is only achieved by someone who doesn't want to reach a goal. He can't get lost either. He always gets home, because he stays with himself. - He wrote on October 15, 1975: "Dear Karli, i thank you and your family deeply for remembering my birthday. I often think back to our adolescence and with it also to your childhood home with all the animals on the terrace, amongst others an eagle owl." Heidegger on philosophy: "Philosophy is actually homesickness, a drive to be at home everywhere." - The older he got, the more he wanted to be back in his homeland and for that reason he uttered the wish to be burried in the graveyard in Messkirch. And that wish he got granted. Once Heidegger started a lecture on Aristotle with the sentence: "Aritoteles was born, he philosophized, and died." Also Heidegger wanted to be talked about in such a way, because this was probably his biggest dream: Living for philosophy and maybe even disappearing in it. Subtitles by Fuchsiarga
