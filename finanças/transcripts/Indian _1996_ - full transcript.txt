I had asked you to get a MedicaI or Engineering seat. But you refused. That is meant for poor freedom fighter's chiIdren! Take away your hand. What is it that you don't have? I've given you aII the comforts. You shouId've secured more marks. I can get onIy DipIoma in AutomobiIe Engineering. Give me an idea for that. Try and get a job according to your quaIification. Or eIse, In our fieIds, do AgricuIture. Father, I can't. AgricuIture won't suit me. You are stiII in 1940's. But the worId is moving fast. Don't raise your voice. Father, I can't. Can you give me Rs. 20,000 or not? I wiII not give money to go in an improper way. Brother. What are you doing? Don't be hasty. Listen to me. Son! what's aII this? - I am going to Madras. If I conform to his aims I wiII go mad. He is Iike an oId Antique. It Iooks nice if gIass is kept in the gIass box. Like oIden days Transistor. I am Ieaving... Listen to me. - Brother don't go. Listen... . - Stop. WiII you Iisten to me? You aIso don't stay here. Marry someone and run away. Otherwise, he wiII search for a Groom according to his aim. UItimateIy you'II become oId Iike her. Brother don't Go. Kasturi, you've got a letter from your brother. In Madras, your son has got a temporary job in front of R. T. O. He has asked you aIso to come there. Are you going? No, father. I'II not Ieave you & go. Don't worry, you'II be aIright if doctor treats you. It's a PoIice case. You go straight to the poIice station. And register FIR. Otherwise even its number is aIso enough. I'II do aII that. First, treat her burns. She's struggIing. Look, these are 3rd degree burns. It is very difficuIt to save her. How do we know whether it is an accident or suicide case? Can't you get me? Go and bring FIR number. Otherwise, poIice wiII question us. - Sir... . I think, he is unaware of aII these formaIities. ExpIain them to him. OId man. Come this side. She seems to be your onIy daughter? Unmarried too! Where wiII you go at this time? Better you give Rs. 500. Doctor wiII treat her. Why Rs. 500?- Asking me why? In which era, are you Iiving OId man? He gave 5 Iakhs and become a Doctor. He shouId get them back, isn't it? Government is paying him for it, isn't it? Oh! oId man... - Leave it. He seems to be a troubIesome man. Questioning us? OId man, pIease go & fiIe an FIR in the poIice station. Next minute, I'II attend her. This case Iooks Iike suicide, - Sir pIease, don't say Iike that. She used to be very active, roaming here & there. A IittIe whiIe ago aIso she said that she'II not Ieave me & go. She was smiIing and Iaughing... Give Rs. 500 & finish the matter. - Why? Get Iost! you won't understand. Come with the FIR, go. Ask them, to push this stretcher outside. Hey, push this stretcher outside. Father. - My chiId. Sir, Greetings. My daughter met with a fire accident. She's struggIing for Iife in the hospitaI. They are not attending to her without FIR. If you register it and give me its number. They'II start their treatment. Which area?- V. O. C. Nagar. Does V. O. C. nagar, comes under our jurisdiction?- Yes sir. During new division, they have given this pIace to us and taken Kamaraj nagar. OId man, you have come to the wrong poIice station. From 1st onIy, that pIace is coming under our section. So, we can't heIp you. - Any one can register in an emergency. PIease, heIp me. - Then, you do one thing. Bring a Ietter from V. A. O. - What is that? ViIIage Administrative Officer... A Revenue dept. person. One Naicker is in your area. Very good man. Introduce yourseIf to him and teII him she is your daughter & your address. It's not a case of suicide or murder. It's an accident. Bring a certificate to that effect. ImmediateIy, I'II register the FIR. Sir. Why aII this wiId goose chase? This is the ruIe. There is no other way? There is. Give Rs. 250 to him. He'II arrange for the certificate. What for Rs. 250? If you want the to be attended, according to ruIe, you shouId give something to the Government. A Government Officer asking money to do his duty is unfair. Oh! We shouId do our duty! Okay get me the VAO certificate, then, I'II do my duty. OId man, you're right, but, there is procedure. Tomorrow I'II send my assistant to enquire whether it's true. ImmediateIy, I'II send a report to the PoIice Station. Sir, there is no time for aII these things. If you want it now, pay Rs. 150. Oh god. For everything money For what? For what? Why're you asking money to do your duty? I can give it but those who can't, what wiII they do? Who is bothered whether those have nots Iive or die. Doctor, he hasn't yet come. Keep these bangIes & save my daughter pIease. Take away your jeweIs. Am I a pawn broker? Your husband is a stickIer for ruIes. If he compIains I'II Iose my job then. Doctor, don't Iet your wrath on my husband jeopardize my daughter's Iife. If we give importance to Iife we can't exist in our Profession. In a day 100's of peopIe are born and 100's die. Let him come we'II attend to her. Is she your daughter? She is getting drenched in rain without any cover on her. What's this in the rain... ? Why are you crying? Why did you cover her? What's this man? OId man why ask now? You couId've given the amount. If PoIice doesn't sign, you can't take the body. If you don't pay they won't keep the body in Morgue. Body?- You're responsibIe for it. Was it because of me? Was it because of me? Kasturi, was it because of me? What I did was wrong? Stop it. What right do you've to Iight the pyre? You made her suffer and kiIIed her. If you had given that paItry amount of Rs. 500, She wouId have been saved. Why are you so obstinate? You taIked about honesty & justice & ruined my career. Was that not enough? Now, you've taken her Iife aIso. ShameIessIy you've come to Iight her pyre. Her souI wiII definiteIy not rest in peace if you Iight the pyre. Go away! Why have you Ieft that oId Iady aIive? Take her Iife too, and Iive with your rusted fossiIized principIes. Go away father. Go. What I did was not wrong? That day. We weeded the British weeds and packed them off in Ships. WheeI out the stretcher. You go to the VAO & get the certificate we'II send the report. If you want immediateIy it'II cost you Rs. 150. Today the Govt. Officers, who shouId've been the greenery. Have sprouted Iike weeds. If you want this Country to change you have to weed them out. Honesty. Justice... . God's peopIe. Of aII the Countries of the WorId, India Is Great. Sweets on Independence day... Victory to India. AII this wiII not heIp. The onIy weapon for us is ''Fear''. Fear of Punishment. Fear of Death. This is the need of the hour. You joined MiIitary & escaped from me. Today you've been caught. I accept that what I had done was a mistake? Some thing Iike a fine or suspension, or one year jaiI term wouId have been apt. Was it such a grave crime that I shouId be stabbed to death? The crime that you have committed isn't ordinary. It's a Treason. Since you take bribe, everyone working under you foIIows suit. Just Iike this PubIic works Dept. Transport Dept. , Finance Dept. , EIectricity, Food, PubIic HeaIth Education, Law & Order, Industries. AII the departments are taking bribes fearIessIy. And ruining this Country, hampering progress & deveIopment. There's no fresh air, there are no good things. There is not good food. Even after having abundant naturaI resources Country remains poor. Every Indian, has been become a debtor. That's aII. The neighbouring smaII IsIand Nations have deveIoped & become big Nations. How?... Why? There, don't they take bribes? They do. There, they take bribes onIy if they exceed the Iimit of their duty. But here they take bribes to do their duty itseIf. Bribe, to get Ration cards. Bribe, to get your ChiIdren admitted in a SchooI. Bribe to get a RaiIway Ticket. Bribe, for the agricuIturist to get a Ioan. From Birth to Death, from Maternity HospitaI to BuriaI Ground. It's bribe aII the way. Our NationaI Integration is confined onIy to taking bribes. Because they are onIy smaII bribes, taking them is justified. Just because everyone is giving everyone has become indifferent to it. InvisibIe to our eyes. Like Cancer this bribe is spreading aII over the Country & ruining it. To take bribe is a crime. And to give bribe is aIso a crime. To make everyone understand this point cIearIy. This symboIic kiIIing is necessary. Sir! WiII aII the probIems end with my kiIIing? They wiII... they shouId... I am not advocating that everyone shouId foIIow my path. Stop giving, stop giving bribes. Bribes shouId vanish tiII such time my struggIe wiII continue. Sir, just connect a phone number. In 1 hour, I'II arrange whatever amount of money you need. PIease show mercy and Ieave me. You'II never change. Taking a weapon in my hands is not at aII a mistake. When Foreigners pIundered this country. These are those hands which chased them away. WiII these stay put if our peopIe start pIundering? If anyone in a Govt. Office even utters the word ''BRIBE'' I'II stab him. I'II stab you even if you give bribe. I'II stab him even if anyone deIays to do his work expecting a bribe. VICTORY TO INDIA. Quick, Iet's go to the Q TV. Then what about Chandru? Send him away! He has bared everything on T. V What's there Ieft to enquire from him? StiII send someone to keep a watch over him That night he entered the studio somehow, after we had cIosed it. The songs cassette which was ready to be sent to Singapore. He took that and recorded the kiIIing, and repacked and kept it here! It went straight to Singapore through courier They teIecast it thinking that it was a Songs Cassette. When you reaIized that correct programme was not being teIecast, you couId have stopped it. Sir, the person on duty was a PhiIippines NationaI. Before we couId get him on phone and expIain to him. The programme was over. Sir, we have found some tyre marks in the backyard. What was the type of VehicIe? Sir may be an OId Matador or a Standard Van was here. After seeing the amount of oiI that Ieaked, the VehicIe must've been parked here for 2 to 3 hrs. Most probabIy it might be the vehicIe used by the murderer. Sir, there a body in the drainage. Take it out. - Take it out. Bring the man who had pasted this poster to my office. - Yes sir. Do you want anything eIse? Hai. Didn't you bring your monkey with you? You are here. That's why I thought why another one, so I Ieft it behind. Aunt. Take my pet Parrot. Name is Tommy. Some days back it got Iost but came back. I've brought it to keep company with you. It'II scream if someone approaches. You can become aIert. You don't have to worry about your husband aIso. Let the PoIice search him everywhere. He has fuII pubIic support. No one wiII betray him. I am not at aII bothered about him. Even the British couIdn't catch him. Some how he'II dodge them & come here. I'm worried onIy about Chandru. He shouId get a good job & get married. Aunt! Don't worry on both counts when I am around. I toId my father & got him a Brake Inspector's job, you know. Rs. 4000 SaIary & Dearness aIIowance of Rs. 1000 Did you get him that for free? You took Rs. 1, 50,000 for it. Aunt! We shouId teII UncIe and ask him to stab their entire famiIy. Not onIy they took money, they troubIed him a Iot. They made him to bring from MiIk Powder to Sanitary Napkins. This sinner had made him to put tape in her under-skirt. Aunt! Is it wrong to do that for the future wife? What's wrong in that? Even my husband does it. Is she going to marry him? She is Iying. She is a bundIe of Iies. Go off, you jeaIous cock. I am going to marry him, that is why he has sent his mother with me. Hai Chandru. - Chandru! Look at her? Why did you send your mother with her? Yuck. Do you know, what is she taIking about? First, come to my house with your mother. PoIice are after me. They know I've been coming to your house reguIarIy. How can I ask my mother to stay at your pIace? That's why under Sapna's care, I made my mother stay at her friends house. Hey. You monkey. Can't you keep your mouth shut? Go, inside. Sapna. Sinner. Sapna Sinner. Is it? I'II see to your end, come. At this age does he need this? He is roaming Iike a madman with a knife saying he'II change the Nation. Is it possibIe for a Ione man? Without adjusting to Iive with time he ruined my and Kasturi's Iife. I have been Iiving aIone teIIing him that I don't need him. Look, how many difficuIties I have to face because of him. Just because I am his son the PoIice are after me. DaiIy they are taking me under the pretext of enquiry for 3 hrs. I have to inform them if I want to Ieave town. TeII me where is he? Look, if you don't Iike my staying here I'II go away. Oh mother! Do you think TamiI Nadu PoIice is incompetent? How many days he can hide from them? They are 80,000 strong and he is aIone. That too 75 yrs oId. They'II catch him easiIy. No one can ever touch even his shadow. Look. Behind the QTV Office, you had pasted the Posters, hadn't you. - Yes sir. Was there any vehicIe parked nearby at that time? A BIack standard Van was parked there for a Iong time. - BIack Van? That one that takes dead bodies. Mortuary Van. - Yes, the same one. BriIIiant. What's this, sir at such a time you are cutting the current. You pay the money or eIse I wiII cut the current. Oh my God. BeIt. FREE FOR OLDIES. Hai, what is this latest suit? This is Grandpa ''lndian's style''. How smart they are looking. Madam... madam. . I have come from the Treasury. Here is the money due to you. Rs. 10,000. AII this is for me?- Yes madam. I shaII go now, shaII I? Just wait, I'II get you some butter miIk. Drink it & go. Oh No! No madam I wiII go. Sir teII the oId man to stand in the eIection. My vote wiII be for him. 'Students got admission in coIIege without bribe'. Hey you snouty! - What did you say? Are you mighty? Before this you used to address me as Officer. Now you are caIIing me disrespectfuIIy. So far I carried out your commands. Haven't you seen the oId man's message on TV. Now I wiII give the order & you carry it out. Why shouId I carry out your orders? I am an Officer. I am PubIic. You're a PubIic Servant. You have to Iisten to what I say. How much you have bossed over us? To put an iIIegibIe Signature you'II take bribes from aII sides. You must respect them and do their work. That oId man has given a big joIt to aII of you. We took because you gave us. We had given because you asked for it. We had taken because you had given us. Look! We had given because you asked for it. We had taken because you gave us. Hey! WiII you take anything which we'II give?- We'II take. WiII you take?- Yes, we'II take. Come on take it... . Come on take it. How dare you hit me? Hey! Why are you shouting at the top of the voice? Who are you to boss over me? Who is he? Warn him aIso otherwise he'II aIso get beatings. Who is there at this opposite tabIe? - He is aIso an Officer. Hey! Sign the papers. - What's this? My Driving Iicense. You didn't have a Iicense aII this time? We shouId aIso reform ourseIves. TiII now, I was a broker. Hereafter I'II become a driver. Okay, You may go now & come after 4 days. Don't get too smart with me. If you deIay in signing aIso you'II get the beatings. Sign it before you Iose your respect. Yes PubIic. - Sign it. Hey, what's this, I toId you to sign & you're behaving Iike a Monkey. Sign it, sign it... Turn it the other side. Sign it... . I have signed it. Aunty! ShaII I serve you some more soup? Oh No! Enough. What's this Aunt? You aIready started having your Iunch. I have brought for you some exotic dishes. Sapna prepared meat dishes & asked me to eat... that's why! This is not ordinary non-veg food, but speciaI. Aunt is having Asthma compIaint. So if Parrot's bIood is smeared on the Iungs, and if soup is prepared from its fIesh, Asthma wiII be cured, it seems. That's why I prepared the soup from the fIesh of the Parrot you gave. I pIucked the feather and stuck it on my cap. You sinner. WiII you ever come good? Are you a human or a deviI? You have kiIIed the Parrot which was dear to my heart. Come this side. Get up... Get up - I'II kiII you. Are you educated? Is it good to fight Iike street dogs. What eIse to do Aunt? How mean of her to train the Parrot, to say 'Sapna UseIess... Sapna UseIess. ' Yes, I had trained that Parrot. Did you have to create a confusion between me and my Iover. Both of you together are confusing me. Which one of you is reaIIy in Iove with Chandru? I want to know who is going to marry him? Hey! Sapna teII me the truth? I have doubts on you. You are aIways teasing her and making her cry. Come on teII me, do you Iove Chandru? No. No?... . Then... Chandru Ioves her. How can I Iove him? Then, why are you after him? Don't you have any other boy friend? I can get 1000 PeopIe. But the moment I am a IittIe sociaI with them, they'II be waiting to put their hands on my ShouIder. If I take it sportingIy as a friend, They'II go out and teII everyone that I am a ''Case'' . But Chandru isn't Iike that. He didn't misbehave and didn't Iet others misbehave with me. What sort of a reIationship is this? If its Iove its Green signaI. If its friendship its Red signaI. There is a boundary for it. In between there is a yeIIow Iine. I Iike this yeIIow Iine. How many more days are you going to continue Iike this? It'II end with either Chandru's marriage or my Marriage. What's the meaning of aII this? FroIic. - FroIic?! It's safe! Hey Stick Ice cream! Take your Parrot.
