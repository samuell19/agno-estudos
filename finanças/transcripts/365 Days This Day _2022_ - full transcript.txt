New house, new wardrobe, but it's still the same old mess. What the hell are you doing here? You're sick people. You know that? You deviants! Freaks! Filthy perverts! Massimo, you have to get out of here! It brings bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. Not to say to bang her and ruin her makeup! You're driving me crazy. You'd give Grandma Krysia a heart attack. - Are you jealous? - Listen to me. Please have some respect for Polish tradition, okay? If you want, next time you can join us. Go, go, go! Adiós, amigos. Ciao, bella! Or whatever you people say. See you later, alligator! It was supposed to be perfect. The wedding, the dress, and you. And I was supposed to be relaxing. Just look at you. I'm not gonna get on your ass about it, but you never smoke. Whatever. If you wanna pretend to be a badass, fine. But I need to know something. You haven't told him, have you? Okay. None of my business. You've been trying to tell him, though, right? I think about it every day. Massimo can never know I was pregnant. That's great. A dark secret is the foundation of any successful relationship. What should I do? Tell him I lost the baby in the tunnel where I almost died? Do you know what he'd do? What? These people aren't normal. A war would break out. A war? Come on. You know Massimo. He never lets things go. Know what a "vendetta" is? Mm-hmm. You do realize we're in Sicily, right? I mean, I've heard the word before. In movies. Who hasn't? Of course I know what it means. Oh shit. I wasn't thinking. It was the hardest decision of my life. I'm sorry. You're the strongest woman I've ever met. You know that? Remember, you're not alone. I'm here for you. So, do you love him? Okay, let's go. Help me get ready.

You're the last person who should be criticizing me. I'm wondering how many pieces of furniture I'll need to replace. Would you be so kind as to make a list of everything that's been tainted? Want a raspberry? In Italian, it's called "lampone." You can stick your lampone up your ass. I would like to propose you two catch up in a different location 'cause Domenico, now he needs to focus on work. Of course, when he's wearing a normal suit and not... What is that, a... a cake or something? Cream. Um, I arranged a little trip for you two. Do I look like furniture that you can move around? - I want you to have fun with your friend. - Oh, really? - It's not a joke. - Why don't you put a leash on me? Oh, I can see honeymoon is over. Shut up. Calm down. We could use a vacation. It's been so long, I've forgotten what alcohol looks like. - I'll be in the office. - All right. What's on your mind? Nothing. I'm just enjoying being here. - Is that why you're acting so serious? - I'm not. I just feel bad about Massimo. He's making a real effort. He arranged this trip. Sometimes I think I'm just like my mom. Uh-uh. Nope. Even worse. You're a typical wife. Thanks, Olga. I can always count on you. No worries. Happy to help. Listen. It's simple, really.

Hey, let me drive this time. - We're here. - Come on. - Just who will be paying for the damage? - What? I drive around Włochy in Warsaw. If I can do it there, I can do it here. Hop in. Okay.

We ate it with our fingers and went roller-skating. Remember? Ah. Honestly? I prefer life now, 20 years later. My skates weren't as fast as the Ferrari. Not for lack of trying. You know what? What?

I know that our beginnings were quite rough, or more like sick. You've kidnapped me, and this is sick. But I fell in love with you, and we are together because I decided. You cannot control people, and I won't let you control me. - I'm your wife, not one of your soldiers. - What are you talking about? - I just want to protect you. - This is not protection. This is prison. I can't live without doing anything. I miss challenges. You're right, my girl. I screwed this up. ♪ You were in love with me ♪ ♪ Now you want to burn my heart ♪ ♪ I know I could love you anyway... ♪ ♪ But it feels That our memories are away ♪ Excuse me. Mrs. Torricelli, right? I didn't want to disturb you. Mrs. Torricelli, right? Yeah. Laura. I'm the new gardener, Nacho. Nacho? Nacho. Nice to meet you. You have a nice cap. Yes, I know. Thank you. But Nacho? It doesn't sound very Italian. It's a nickname. My family has Spanish roots. And you? Where are you from? Poland. Thirsty? Oh, yes. Thank you. How long have you been working for my husband? I just started. Mr. Torricelli wants some changes in the garden. I have to work. I wouldn't like to waste your precious time. Wasting my time? You're talking to a person who has absolutely nothing to do. Now my only job is being a... wife. How pathetic is that? You're wrong, missus. Being a good wife is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. Oh. It's why I'm so perfect at it. 'Cause I don't have to do anything. They cook for me. They clean for me. Even they cut flowers for me. It's why I'm so perfect at doing nothing. You are a real busy bee. That's a great talent. To be perfect without doing anything. Please don't tell me that you also make money by doing nothing. Where do you think it all comes from? You need to teach me that. Mrs. Torricelli! I must go. Thank you for the water. Ah. I will cut some flowers for you. It was a pleasure, Laura from Poland.

It was a wonderful gift. Anything for you. Don't you miss your family? Because, besides Domenico, you have nobody. You had Mario. It was Mario's own decision to retire. I didn't make him do it. He couldn't deal with... After the accident, he was blaming himself for what happened, but I know that he couldn't do anything. But... he's a man of honor. And I've lost my right hand. Yeah. I know how important he was in your life. Sometimes I think that, uh, you feel so lonely... 'cause besides me, you have no one. No parents, no siblings. I have a brother. But I'd rather not have him. But... correct me if I'm wrong... Do we still have something to try out? You have a brother? And you didn't tell me about this before? I still have some work to do. No, do not tell me that you're about to leave. Massimo. Massimo! This is one hell of a present. Hello, ladies. I am Emily. - Hello. - I'm glad you're here. Thank you so much. I'm Laura, and this is my best friend, Olga. Hello! Hi. Let's go. Luxury is my middle name. - Do you like it? - Amazing. If I understand correctly, we have to talk about business after the New Year. And today we have to make you look like superstars. Is that right? Sure, sure. But remember, I'm the hot goddess. You get used to her. Or not. Mia, can we begin? Of course.

Something's wrong. - I don't want to talk about it. - Do I have to force it out of you? I'm pissed off at Massimo. But I'm not discussing it with him or with you. I get it. I respect your decision. Booze would help. It's enough for me. I want to go back. Excuse me. Can't you see I'm in the middle of a conversation? Yeah. You're so gentle, talking to him, but talking to me, it's a different situation, right? I have one more last conversation. Yeah. Right. I'll do my best to be quick. All conversations are more important than one with me. Excuse me. Thanks for inviting us. I haven't had this much fun in ages. Mom, I'm not sure I can say the same about Dad. If the love of my life is having fun, so am I. You know what? You've been married for 30 years, and I wish Massimo looked at me the same way Dad looks at you. Sweetie, you need to understand that marriage is about compromise. Don't you agree, honey? I wouldn't dare think otherwise. And now... let's dance. Just you and me. Laura? Do you feel okay? Get me out from here. Can you stop the car, please? My God. How could he be so stupid? And with her? I wish I could go away from here and never come back. I'm flying home in a few hours. We will find a ticket... if you want to sort things out... away from here. Wait for a second. The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later. Mom, I'm sorry. You were right. I was wrong about Massimo. After what I saw, I don't want to see him ever again. Obviously. I need to get away for a while and collect my thoughts. Don't worry about me. I'm safe. I love you. I'll call in a few days. Take me anywhere, but take me away from here. Wow, you look great. I like you in this outfit. I took what I found in the closet. Maybe it's your girlfriend's? I think she prefers a sporty style. Sister's. I don't have a girlfriend, Laura. These are my sister's clothes. Come. Dinner is ready. Look what I made for you. My favorite dish. - Paella. - But dinner? Did I sleep so long? It's so nice here. It's my father's house. Anyway, my sister Amelia will come by later. I think you will like each other. She's a cool girl. She's a bit moody. You know, pregnancy hormones. Your sister is pregnant. I'm sorry. Oh. Are you okay? It's just a pity she chose an asshole for the father. Wait a moment. I have to clean. I'm gonna kill him! Excuse me. Leave me alone! Let her through. I have no idea where she... What did you do to her? What did you do to my daughter? She recorded a message saying she was leaving you. She never wants to see you again. I knew you were a bad person since I met you. I don't know what you did to her, but I know one thing. If my daughter decided to leave you, she has a damn good reason for it! We are going back to Poland. We'll wait for her to come home. My husband is already in the car. Don't try to stop me.

I'm treated like a queen. How do you know that Nacho doesn't like him? Because he's Sicilian. I used to like Sicilians. You used to love the Sicilians. That's even worse. Wow. I can see that your brother takes care a lot about you. Yeah, Nacho is wonderful. The best. Just don't tell him I said that. I would like to see him finally settle down with some nice girl. Like you. He deserves it. How do you know I'm nice? You just met me. Intuition. It never disappoints me. And there is something between you two, I hope. Oh, really? But you know, my life got complicated, so right now, I have to fix it. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. And you know that Nacho worked for me as a gardener? As a gardener? Oh my God, my brother will never cease to amaze me. So, you didn't know what he was doing in Sicily? Honey, you can't keep up with Nacho. He's the most spontaneous person I know, and he's also very loyal to his family. Maybe too loyal sometimes. Nacho! - I did my hair and makeup. Come on. - Sorry. Ah. I forgive you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. A Sicilian man can only be understood by a woman born and raised in Sicily. You can't expect a woman who's been living a normal life in Poland to be able to handle life with... ...an extraordinary man such as yourself. Let's put all that behind us. Let's join forces and unite our families. We will be indestructible. Thanks for coming. I had my doubts, but now I'm sure. Laura didn't leave on her own. You were involved.

How do you know I'm good? Maybe something's wrong with me because he cheated on me. Laura... don't you ever say that again. It's not your fault. A guy cheating on a woman like you must be an idiot.

What do you want? I have a message. Spit it out. I don't have all day. She's not in Sicily. - What did you say? - How come? She left with him. Please, don't. I'm just... You're just a clown. You just screwed up our plan. Everything was ready. All you had to do was pick her up. Will you take care of him... ...or should I do it? Okay, calm down. Relax. Have a seat on the couch, okay?

Wow, you look so gorgeous in that dress. - Thank you. - Ladies. I can see you won't be missing me too much. But I hope you will miss me a little bit. Let's sit.

Nobody taught you that gentlemen do not come to a woman's bedroom uninvited? Technically speaking, this is my bedroom that I'm sharing with you so you don't have to sleep on the beach. You must admit that I am a real gentleman. Anyway, I just came to tell you that food is ready. Ah. Was it... a nightmare or just an erotic dream? - It was sex. - With whom? With you. And did you like it to be? It was pretty good, but in my entire life, I had better. This is my asylum. One day, I would like to leave here for good with someone like you. But for now, you're stuck here with me, so... I'm not going anywhere... yet. We are going to see my father today. And? That makes you worried, or what? I've already met your sister, and you're not going to tell him that we're getting married or something like this. So? Massimo will be there. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Here, they're coming ♪ Sir, they're here. ♪ Here, they're coming ♪ Let them wait. ♪ I see their carts are rolling ♪ ♪ Better run ♪ Who are you? And stop telling me bullshit about being a gardener. This is the only moment that you can tell me the truth. I am Marcelo "Nacho" Matos, son of Don Fernando Matos, the head of the local Mafia and eternal rival of your husband's family. So, your father told you to bring me to the island? No. You came here because you wanted to. What if I didn't want to? I would've found a way. Fuck. I was so naive. I thought that you were my real friend and nothing was a coincidence. Laura, I wasn't faking my feelings for you. So I guess I have to thank you. 'Cause you proved that men aren't good. Only good at lying. You think I would fake all of this? Take you to the beach? Teach you to surf? And the kiss? You didn't feel it was real? It was real, like a fairy tale. And if you think I would fall in love again with a guy who thinks he can have me just like that, you're absolutely wrong. 'Cause I've learned from my mistakes, and I've learned that you're a fuckin' liar. Laura. Be rational. I didn't make you come here. You came with me because you felt safe. No. You ruined everything since the moment you hid the truth from me. And I'm done with guys who think that they can do whatever they want. Take me there. Let's end with these gangster games. Fuck. ♪ Walkin' on water ♪ ♪ Time to summon my faith... ♪ I always dreamed of living in a beach house and opening a surf school. I was just unlucky to be born into the wrong family. My father had different plans for me. Laura, for God's sake, you are the wife of a Mafia boss. You know how important the loyalty is for the family. When the Mob boss is your father, you don't have much choice. No. You always have a choice. The thing is, you have to take responsibility of your own life. We'll take care of her now. No. She's coming with me. Don Matos asked you to come alone. Nobody told me about that. He already has guests. Laura. What? - Be careful. - Oh, really? I don't think anything worse than the last few days could happen. Thank you for accepting the invitation to the meeting. I didn't really have a choice. Oh, I would like to apologize that we are meeting in such unpleasant circumstances, but I believe that, as a businessman, you will understand that the goal justifies the means. After all, the stakes are high. Our family had the non-aggression pact. You violated it. Oh, your father and I, we were both men of honor. As long as he was alive, we both respected the borders of our interests. But you, Massimo, you're expanding too much. Some people don't like it. Some people? Some people, who? You? We have been sending you warnings. Laura's accident. But you were too convinced of your own strength. Your father was wise. He knew that no opponent should be taken lightly. I cannot bear... more chances with you as a boss. All the families would benefit from someone more, uh, controllable to be in your place. We figured your stupid brother will do perfect. He's so blinded with revenge and greed that he doesn't care much for the family business. You're wrong. You're wrong... if you think I'm gonna put my father's empire into the hands of a dog. Sit down. Massimo... A traitor who put my dad into the hands of Death! You're fucking wrong! Let me remind you that your wife is still with us. You call yourself a man of honor? And you use my wife this way? Massimo, coming here with Nacho was Laura's decision. Nobody made her do it. I need to see my wife. I need to see my wife. Now. Oh, I can assure you that she's safe. Marcelo brought her to the island and has been taking care for her. Now she's with Miguel, my personal bodyguard. Father. - You said Laura's with Miguel? - Yes. I wanted to make sure she'd be safe. Laura left with Enrique and the other bodyguard. What? Find her. We need to go. Now. ♪ I try to forget your name ♪ ♪ But I'm fallin' apart into pieces ♪ ♪ And I think to myself ♪ ♪ Are we damned? ♪ ♪ We almost lost this game ♪ ♪ But I don't believe it's the end ♪ You were the biggest mistake of my life. How could you? How could you? Shh. You're not Massimo. No. I'm not. I am Adriano Torricelli. The twin brother who was so unlucky because he was born ten minutes later. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. But it's nice to meet you, baby girl. Do not call me "baby girl." - Where is Massimo? - He's not too far. Not too far. But I think that you have to wait a little longer. He's a busy man. Yeah, I'm happy to spend a lot of time with my new sister-in-law, you know, and have a little chat with her. We have nothing to talk about. I disagree. I'm gonna tell you a story about taking back what's mine. I mean, my dad is no longer an obstacle, yeah. And now... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have to get rid of your husband. Don't worry, Laura. I won't leave you alone with him. What are you doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm winning. Massimo made a huge mistake by underestimating the anger of the abandoned woman. What are you doing here? You were supposed to wait in Sicily until the negotiations were over. You know them? Honey, we were the ones who pushed you into his arms. Did you really think you could just say the word and I'd disappear from your life? That I would've lived off your handouts in exile? No, Massimo. No. You finally showed your weakness. Question is, do you really think this little whore's worth the whole empire our father created? Though I have to say, she's not bad.
