July 14 It is Paris, 13th July and preparations are underway for Bastille Day celebrations. Stop that kids! It is forbidden to touch my taxi. Scram, or I'll come down and spank you! It fell. - Yes, I see. I came to do your room. I thought you'd gone. OK. Come back in a few minutes. All right, I'm ready. Stop that, you fool! Can't you be polite? You've no right to touch my car. I will if I want. I'm coming down and you'll see! He's coming down... Look out! Come and see something! Well... he took it away. What... the picture? - Yes... Remember the brunette who used to come and see him? She lived with him for a while. And then..? - She left him. Here it is. - What? Her photo. He threw it away. He doesn't love her anymore. Good riddance! Now, don't dare touch my car. What if I do? Don't you see? Park your bus elsewhere. I don't need your advice. Can't you be polite? No chance! What are you doing tonight? Same as usual... working. I'll call on you. If I've nothing better to do... we'll go and dance. If I feel like it. All right. We'll see. We'll see. Listen to me! Not too low. We need to lower the blind. It isn't tied up yet. - Do as I tell you! His crazy, and you're a fool! Morning Mr. Leon. Good morning. How are you? Where are you going all dressed up? To spend the day with friends in the country. Aren't you lucky! Have a good time. Goodbye. Good-day, Children. Good-day, Madam. I found her! Come on. Good Morning Mother. Anna! Did you sleep well? Fine. How are you? Very well. Isn't this pretty! Good morning, Mr. Leon. Miss Anna! How are you? - Well. This looks nice. Wait until tonight... with the Chinese lanterns. Go somewhere else to play children. Can't you look where you're going? Do you have hiccups? I wonder how you could get a license. You'd be better riding in a tram! Ain't it a pity to see that! Just have a look at that mug! Go on, yokel! Yokel yourself! Can't you signal when you stop? Where did you learn your job? Blindmen shouldn't drive! You think you're alone in the streets, perhaps? If you can't drive, you'd better stay home. You're impolite. - Impolite? Exactly. - I dare you to say it again. Say it again right now. What? I'll fix you too! White hair or no white hair! You can't talk like that! - I'll do as I like. You must've driven in a place where you were the only driver. And you, in a desert! Stop that! My client is a gentleman, and worthy of respect. The lousy dog! A well-dressed man like you... it's scandalous! Pay what's due: 12 frs, 50. You don't want it! Say that again! Like this one better? - Of course I do. Anything for a friend. - A friend? I see, he must be paid in coins. There. "My friend", he said. "Is it you or me?" My! 100 francs. You're lucky! Careful next time you try to do it again. So I'm in the wrong! Of course! I'd stopped and you... You didn't signal. Do you need the Place de la Concorde!? Go somewhere else and settle your differences! Mind your own business! Same to you! Close your door. Go on, you beggar! Some flowers, sir? No thanks, their scent is enough. That's enough! Thank you. It was all a mistake... That's perfect! Do you want another table? Still here, my child? That's the limit! Delightful! Please forgive her Sir. She will apologise. No I won't! I'm not here to be kissed. Sorry Sir. I'll get her back. It's nothing at all. Tell the gentleman you're awfully sorry. I'm nothing of the sort. Then you'll leave this place. There are other places to sell flowers. Besides, I'm fed up with your club! You're courteous and well bred. I like it. Here's my card in case you need me. Crazy old bum! She's delightful, yes indeed! Kindly forgive her. Besides, she's dismissed. Very good, she's so nice. And lovely besides. My card, in case you need me. A man tried to kiss me... An old drunk with white hair. That's my client. Congratulations! He kissed me, and I slapped his face! The Boss got angry. I wouldn't stay in such a place. He gave me 100 frs. Leave us alone. We want to dance. You don't care, of course. Where are you going? I know a very nice dance hall. Where? Near the "Butterfly". You know it? Yes, of course. On the square, over there. I don't feel like having fun tonight. Forget what happened. - It's hard. Driver! - Are you free? That's the old drunk that kissed me! Go away, and hurry! You're bound to be slapped again. Let's get on with our trip. I know how you treat girls. I hate that. My friend... I said no! I won't repeat it. Good-bye my friend. Let's get moving. All right. We'll meet over there. And I'll show you how to dance! Trust me, you'll be surprised! See you later, old man! Shall we dance? If you like. What's the matter? My wallet! Always forgetting something! I left it in my coat. Look out! Excuse me. Fortunately, you were here. Otherwise... Yes, but we were here! Thank you. I got it! How careless you are! It might happen to anyone. That was too short. They're tired already. Excuse me... - Move it! Come on. Let me see if me dress is OK. Damn your dress! You don't have to wear it! What's up? This is a joke. Waiter, get out of here! Come on... Let's start again. You're not dancing. To that music? It's not fun. Well, I'm having fun. Not again. It's useless to go on. They keep stopping. They'll pick it up. Go and drink... somewhere else! Somewhere else! Leave me alone, I'm fed up! Why? It's no fun anymore. You're bad tempered tonight. If I am, dance with another girl. You're being silly! - I'll behave as I like. Where did you come from? Your car. I didn't want you. How did you get in? Quietly. You wouldn't be here if I'd seen you. I hate bores. My flag was up too. I could've been fined. And you wouldn't have paid it for me, you old miser! My dear... will you allow me? Stop that, you old fool! I'm big enough to take care of myself. But you let the old skunk kiss you. Savage! Don't ever do that again. - Leave me alone! I'll never drive you again. That's enough... Come and dance with me. All right... Excuse me. I'm going to dance. Enjoy yourself! One moment! What is it now? Here's my card. We'll settle it at once. You're too old. Right away! We'll see... Sir, allow me. Please hold this for me. Let's have it out. Big coward... He's afraid! My coat... Pardon me! Thanks, you're very kind. It's raining. It's nothing. It won't make us stop. It's raining hard now! Look at him. He's furious. But all the same... That is a bit too much. What are you doing here? Taking cover of course. There are plenty of other doors. Why? Am I in your way? I see... Bye then! What are you doing? Nothing. Excuse me... What are you doing? It's stopped raining. It falls, then it stops. You're a true friend! My hat! Hey, you old drunk! This is my cap. What impudence! To do that in front of children! Good evening. Don't look at people in that silly way! Get in, and hurry! It's stopped raining. Now we can dance. My turn. You promised. Do you really wan't to dance with him? Yes! A moment ago, you refused. Things are different. Aren't girls complicated and unpredictable?! I'll remain a bachelor, like my Dad. Goodbye, John. Goodbye, Anna. Leaving already? You could say "goodnight". Go to bed. Coming tomorrow? Yes, for a little poker. Yes, I'll come tomorrow. John, you'll really come and dance, promise? Sure I will. With me? Sure... with you. Are you going to leave my door open all night? What's up with her? It's a damn shame for you... that you're kissed in doorways! You've no right to talk like that! Cheeky girl! Silly old fool! You go too far! Goodnight! Goodnight... See you later. - Bye. What about us? About us? We don't get kissed. No... no... not him! Bye. Hello, boy! Hello. Why are you here? To see you again. Indeed! Go back to where you came from. Vanish! You're not very polite. Leave me alone! You're hurting me. Shut up! See what you did? Mind the neighbours. I don't give a damn! You want money? I've got none. Go ask for it elsewhere. I wouldn't ask you for money. Sure! Get out! Can't you shut your door? You're keeping us awake... That's no reason to push your way in. Dear me! What did they do to you? Hooligan! For the last time, get up and leave. Look... You've torn my dress. You heard me. I'll leave... tomorrow morning. No, right away. Let me stay here... Just for the night. When you could stay, you left me. Now I'm fed up with you! Mind the neighbours. They can go to hell! If you want it that way, I'll go. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You don't want a kiss? Don't make fun of me. If I did, I really wouldn't have come back. Why have you? Can't you leave me alone? I'll never see you again! Not so loud. Paula, I don't love you any longer. I know... No, you don't know. Not so long ago... but it's over. Is it over... really? Really! Your tie isn't straight. Leave me alone! Afraid of me? - No. Well then... Anna... Mamma? Come child, it's late. Yes Mother, right away. OK... You can stay until tomorrow. But you'll leave in the morning. Goodnight! Where will you go? Out... To take a walk. Poor child, you've had a bad night. When I came home last night she was well. But she couldn't stand up this morning. She fainted several times. So I sent her to bed again. I'm at a loss. Don't worry, it will be alright. How do you feel? Not so good. Do you want something? No, nothing. I heard you talking. You're unwell? No, not at all. I'm resting a bit. Did you send for the Doctor? Yes I did. I'll stay with you until he arrives. That's very nice of you. Don't stay at the window looking like that! I'm big enough to decide how to look! We'll see! No more scandal! Everyone was complaining this morning. I don't care. I'll get rid of Mr. Rigaud if he keeps you. Get out and leave me alone. I said what I had to say. She won't dare do it again. Here she is. What are you doing here, you silly fools? Shameless girl! Get inside! Aren't you ashamed to show yourself like that? What about you? You're not exactly beautiful! I'll put a stop to all that. You'd be right too. I'll throw her out. I won't keep her here. That's nice, isn't it! We can drink together. So you were in the country? I haven't seen you for quite a while. My friend Fernand... Miss Paula. A pleasure Miss. Cute, isn't she? Yes, very. She's eating her ice-cream. Do you want one yourself? No thanks. Let's go to another joint. If you like. Coming with us Miss? With pleasure. Would you please tell John that... I can't go dancing tonight. Mother's very ill, so I can't go out. Tell him yourself! Is he in? Don't know! Give your message yourself. You're very kind indeed. Thanks! Do you know what she did? She let the tenant of the third floor kiss her. The tenant of the third floor! Think I can put up with such things? Well, see you tonight at the ball. Perhaps. I'll see. Don't say 'I'll see'. Come! We'll dance together. I'm exceptional you know. No, no... I'm not... Easy does it! Did you see? There's trouble ahead. Why? They're going to collide, upstairs. Who? This one and the other girl. They're not arguing... Quick! One is coming downstairs! She's crazy! What a brute! Did you hurt yourself? Poor darling! It's nothing. You see... it's all over. Don't cry... It's not worth crying. Now let's have a smile, a fine one. That's it, a nice smile. Now, now... It's all over... Don't cry. You don't feel anything now. There... Anna, Where will we meet tonight? I don't want to see you tonight. Meaning..? I'll be busy WHAT? Nothing nicer to tell me? I've nothing to tell you. If you think that's funny, goodbye! Goodbye. I hate being made fun of. Yet that's what you did to me last night. Goodbye! Don't touch me. Leave me alone! Explain at once! I've nothing to explain. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing, everything's all right. Is that you, Anna? How is she? She's resting. I'll be all right. Sorry, I have to go now. Does it really make you sad to go? May I stay..? If you like. Anna... Mamma? Come in child, it's late. Yes, at once Mother. Anna... Mamma! Mamma! Come quick! Help! Help... Help! John!...John! John! John! John! Let's go dancing. "In every corner of Paris," "Whenever the day is over," "Every time a love-dream is born" "Another love-dream is broken..." "In every corner of Paris," "Whenever the day is over," "Every time a love dream is born" "Another love-dream is broken!" The music never stops! Couldn't this door be shut? What? The door. Shut the door. Shut the door. Some people... they have no ears for music. I love music. And you? So do I. There's no more music, so I'm going. It's on you. - If you like. I'm off to work. - Goodbye. 'Bye, poisoner! See you soon. Goodbye, girl... Take Care. Do you see John, sometimes? No. Filthy dog! Driver, are you free or not? Yes, let's go. I'm in a hurry. Then take another taxi. All alike! Look at that. The door, please! Always open! And you... Do you see John? Now, not so often. I think he's quit driving. He's friendly with people I cannot stand. But what does he do? What does he do? Who knows? Is this all you can do? What about you? - Here it is. A little dough, I see. There's a ring too. Not so bad. Allow me. What for? No sale! When your gentleman friend works... he'll get his share. The only thing he can do is drive a taxi. I can also make you shut up. Maybe not. Good reply. I'll show you! Come on John! - Keep quiet. Now now, don't be foolish. Mind you own business! What rubbish! Aren't you crazy, both of you? He's right, why are you interfering? Honestly, you're not serious! She says one word, and you become angry. You're worse than children! John, do you know what I'd do if I were you? What's that? You're making me sick, all of you! Goodbye. You can't be serious John! For a little word - puff - he's gone! OK, go with him if you're not satisfied. What did you say? I said..."Go with him". OK, I got you... Well, I'm going then. You see... I'm leaving. I'm going. Goodbye. You see... I've left. It's upsetting, about John. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry indeed. So am I. Tell me... Do you like this ring? Perhaps. Well... can't I have a "thank you"? How much longer will you be? It's all fixed. No need to worry yourself. OK, let's go. I have ten minutes to catch my train. Don't worry. Don't worry. There are plenty of trains, you know. What now? Have you seen my dog? I haven't seen any dog. Toto... Toto! He was here two minutes ago... Toto?! Enough with your dog! Let's leave without him. We can't! - I will miss my train. Just call him... Do as I do! Whistle for it. Get away, dirty dog! Dirty? My dog? He's immaculate! Come here... Quickly! She said he's a dirty dog! Leave that dog alone. He's mine! Prove it! He just climbed down. I didn't see that. Want to see his papers? He's pure-bred. Pure-bred! And you? I haven't seen you in ages! Hey, did you come to see Anna? No, what makes you ask? Nothing. Driver! What a bore!...'Bye John. Goodbye. He's a friend of yours? Shame! He'll never get into his taxi! Gone away! So I put two coins in? Yes, then you press the button. A drink? No thanks. Come on, there's terrific music in there. No, I'm expected. See you tonight then. See you. Want us to catch pneumonia? Can't you shut the door? The spring is broken. Will you shut that door!!! Anna? Are you deaf or what? I called you three times... The gentleman is waiting. Don't worry, Miss. I got time. What will it be? A packet of blue cigarettes - "Gauloises". Excuse me, there was too much noise. Yes, when that piano's playing, it's terrible. Careful! You're giving me my note back. I don't want to rob you. You can't do anything right! But, Sir... When one's incapable, one doesn't work. Anyone can make a mistake. Don't make that kid cry. To cheer you up, I'll play some music. What would you like to hear? What's the matter? Just shake it a bit and it will play. Then do this... Just when it's shaken? The room is still vacant. So, if you want to come back, it's free. OK Do you still like the view? Well? I don't know... I might come back. You won't decide now? No, not today. To our success... and your career with us. Don't you think we're taking you in for a lousy job? I planned it very carefully. It's a small pub and... - Shut up, we're not alone. There's no-one else around. A small pub, with only one barmaid... Don't worry, I've been there. I got friendly with the girl. The cash register is very easy to break into. What's most wonderful is the pianola. You just put two cents into it, and off it goes! Are you coming with us then? Of course. What shall I do? Less than nothing. You'll be on watch duty. Not too hard, is it? I'll have the music on. Nobody will hear us. Should you see anyone, you'll warn us. We'll work fast. It won't take more than two minutes. Are you coming or not? OK, let's go. Good night. Come on, the girl's alone! You keep walking back and forth. Put your hands behind your back... as a signal. Good evening. Hello. - Hello. May we buy a drink? No, it's much too late. We've already closed. Not too late for us. After all, we're valued customers. I was here this afternoon. So you see... And besides, we're very thirsty. Alright. What will you have? A brandy. And you? A lemonade with grenadine. You never heard such music! I played it twice this afternoon. It has a terrific sound... There. Listen to this. What's wrong? It worked this afternoon. Why doesn't it play, Miss? Did you insert a coin? Of course I did. You saw how the boss shook it. Yeah, I remember. How did he do it again? Like this? OK, I've got it. One o'clock! So what..? You can't play it. Why is that? The boss is upstairs. If he hears it, he'll come down. He'll be furious if he sees you here. Yes, I see. What do we do now? Wait until she returns. Anna! What is it? Anna! Don't you know me? Of course. Hello John. Hello Anna. He knows her? That boy is clever! He'll talk to her while we're working. What are you doing here? Nothing... Just passing by. You came... to see me? No... I didn't know... So you work here? Goodbye, John. Don't go in! Why? Don't go I'm telling you! Leave me alone! Looks like a lovers' quarrel. The key's in her pocket! Swine!...Leave her alone! Aren't you crazy? Out of here, both of you! Who told you to come in here? Mind your own business. It is my business! Your business? Explain to him... She's got the key. Leave us alone. Get away! Quick! What's the matter? They've taken the handle! This way... hurry! Anna! Now get away. Why? When shall I see you? Never. It's all over. Perhaps you're right. Goodbye. Anna? Get away! Hurry! Anna, what is it? Nothing. What do you think? What's all this noise about? It's the pianola. The pianola?! I didn't do it on purpose. Sorry to have woken you up. What's that nonsense? A pianola playing all by itself! There was someone in your room, wasn't there? Are you listening? There was a man in your room! Yes. Congratulations! A girl I hired out of charity! You're fired! And I let you handle the money! You'll leave in the morning. Did you hear me? Yes, I heard you. "After long, hopeless days," "They met perchance one evening." "They didn't smile to each other" "But they could read each others eyes" "That happiness could soon be theirs." "They could not say one word" "But their eyes spoke for them." "In every corner of Paris," "When the dreamy night has fallen," "Somewhere a soul who is moved" "Conjures a dream of love." "In Paris, when night has fallen" "In every corner of Paris," "Somewhere, a soul who is moved" "Is still dreaming of love." Hello! How are you? Alright. Want to see someone? The boss, if possible. He's around somewhere. What is it, Miss? Sir, do you think you could take me back? If you have nobody else, I though perhaps you... You've changed your mind? Sir, come... come quickly! Keep going, keep going! Play... make noise! He must be stopped! Go and tell him. Tell him yourself. Talk to him. What shall I say? I don't know... anything. Sir... Sir... Pardon me... What is it? Sir... couldn't you... Be kind enough... I don't understand. I see. You want this? Take it if it pleases you. Thank you, Sir. I'll sort him out, the bastard! He's got another one! You're not frightening us. Not frightening us! Look out. And now, I shoot. Go and get the police! He's going to kill her! What are you doing? Hello, my child. - Hello. I haven't seen you for a long time. No... allow me. Wouldn't a little walk do you good? Exactly. I was waiting for you. People are not cheerful anymore. That's funny, they've stopped playing. Come on Ladies, enjoy yourselves! Have fun! What happened? They've all gone. You're all safe and sound! Why are we leaving? Let's go back! No, go to bed. It's all finished. What is it? Your car? - Yes, my car. Goodnight then. Please sell your flowers to me? But Sir! Have you seen my driver? - No. Where can that driver be? Driver! Well, my friend... Well, if this isn't Anna! Hello! I'm so glad to see you! Tell me what happened. How smart you look! - I'm doing fine. Come on, my friend... Can't you ever leave us in peace?! You're a bore when you're drunk. - Drunk! Me? - He doesn't realise. I'm so glad! Remember the old times? Let's go! Where to? - Everywhere. Sorry! See you soon, I hope. Come on! Goodbye. Here's your cap. Pretty little cap! Sorry Sir, I haven't got the change. Very sorry. I didn't think... Here. Are you ready or aren't you? You were in a hurry. We leave now, Sir! Just because you like to drive... doesn't mean that I find it funny to be driven! Are you alright? Those drivers are brutes! Their motto is 'speed'. I didn't see the accident... but I'm at your disposal... as a witness. That fool threw himself under my car! It's nothing, but I could have... been terribly wounded. Those silly carts! - We see worse in our trade. With such drivers, no wonder! She's the cause of the accident. How dare you say that! If the poor girl could talk... "You crazy driver!", that's what she'd say! If you can't push a cart, act in the movies! Keep quiet! I see things as they are: Old men after young girls. And girls who like it. Can't you stay in your taxi? Can't your driver talk? He wants a lawyer? A lawyer... for me? What did I do? You crossed the street... You were driving like mad! Like mad... I?! You fool! So you're keeping silent now?! That'll teach you to mind you own business. Are you talking to me? Come over here and say it! No, you come here... then you'll see. He's afraid, but you are a filthy coward! The skunk!...My umbrella! "In every corner of Paris," "The bright sun of every day..." "Shines over each destiny" "And brings a dream of love..."
