THE GREEN BEAUTIFUL - Good morning everybody, we have news, the meeting of the planet is opened. - We need of the rye... Yes. - We have some wheat. - We need soya! - We have it! - We have a big crop of dry fruits! - Yes... - I would need it for two months. - Medicines? - Yes! - We won't have anougt for everybody. - Wool! - Who wants some wool? - It's good! - How many knives we need? Seventen. - Schools? - We would need a teacher of telepathy. Mass died, we have nobody who's ready. - Ok, I'll come to you this year. - A teacher of future prediction, - I can, but only for six months, I have a grandson who I am going to deliver. - Marriages? - Three boys. - Then deaths. There was Amais 255 and a quarter years old, 248 years Aramos, Laleta 272 years old. All died happy and wise. Ah, on the contrary there was the death of Amile who was only 143 years old, he had an accident, a rockfall. How re you Mila, it is not too sad for you? - It's all right, the kids help me well. - Fine, then travels? - This year we would really need to send somebody to the Earth. It's been 200 years since we were there. - Who wants to go on the Earth? To Narbos? - We can only send ten to Narbos, you arrange it between you. - To Earth? - To Cristo? - We can send only 23 to Cristo, you deside who. - Who wants to go to the Earth? Nobody for the Earth? So what should we do? - As usual, we don't go there? - It 's 200 years since last time we went, this year we should send somebody there. - What for? - Nothing special, we observe, we enquire, we see what we can do. - We can do nothing... - Sure, other planets teach us things so do we, but the Earth... - Well, they are very outdated but that's no reason to... - And dangerous! - We could have send them someone with the program of disconnection, to move them forward more quickly. - But we don't even know where they are now! - But we could guess. - I could get information about the Earth from Osam, he was a last one there, but he's been on Narbonne for 20 years. - I'm here, you didn't see me, I came back from Narbonne 2 months ago. - Greetings Osam, I had not seen you. So, could you tell us, where were they at that time when you came back from the Earth? - Yes, of course, but it was long time ago, there were two of us, Mila's father and I. We landed in France in Paris, there was a revolution against the King, That's right, they had become a republic, but... that was very quickly spoiled, they had an Emperor, Napoleon, or something like that. An agressor, who slaughter people in stupid wars. After this, the kings came back, society continued to degrade, leaders, presidents, all those, came one after another. - Was it really that difficult overthere? - Oh yes, law of the strongest, squashed women, no distribution, massacres. We had a feeling that it would take them centuries to recover. They even had the system of the money still. Before we left I had hid some gold. - What is this money? - For instance if you want something, you can't get it without money. - Even to eat? - Especially! - But to eat it's neccesity, we die if we don't eat. - But they do this, if you have no money you have nothing. - You think that they still have this money? - No, I really don't think so. When we left, that was the beginning of an industrial era. - What is that? - I think we past it abouts 3000 years ago or close to that. It was competition, literacy, mass production of useless objects, wars, nuclear technology, destruction of nature, diseases without cures, a prehistoric period! - Last year my brother had a telepathic contact with the Earth. - Yes, I saw a country where the women had a veils on their faces, and they did't have the right to drive a car. - Impossible, you think that they still have cars? - What is it, cars? - I have never seen it, because when we left the Earth, they still did't have them. But it seems that us too once had cars in our industrial era. - Yes, we teach it in archaeology, they were made of iron, you set down inside it and move all around. - People didn't walk any more, then they died from heart attacks. - And there were millions of deaths from accidents. - But I really think in 200 years, they've had the time to get rid of those cars. What about their hierarchy? - Oh, that hierarchy, overthere is something. The men think they're superior to the women, city people above the villagers, adults are better then the children, the human beings are suerior to the animals and plants, and then there are the races. - It's a big planet, with many different continents which results in many different human beings seperate from each others, then when they met, the most degenerate thought they were superior then everybody, there was mass killings, and now it is the degenerates who dominate everything. - We were lucky with our little planet, the single race, the single climate, the single way of development, easy! - But it's not because they didn't have chance they didn't even try. - Anyway we shouldn't give up on them, we can't say that we've done anything to help. - But they are not open to communication, They are probably plaything with computers instead of execising their brain, they are using 10% of it. - Their brain must be the size of a sheep's poo. - It's useless to go there. They should go their own way. It's like with lettuce, do not pull over it's soil it'll grow more quickly! - But we could've put it a little manure on their lettuce. - Yes, we can disconnect a group of well chosen people to help them. - So, volunteers? - Anyone, come on, just one, full of courage. - Excuse me, but I want to go there. - Oh mum, you want to go? - Mila, you want to go there? - No, she doesn't go there! - Yes, I want to go there. - Mum, are you crazy? - So Mila, are you going or not? - No! - Yes! - All right, we give you the program of the Europeans languages, - We almost found all of them. - We're going to try to make you land in Paris, but we arn't sure that you'll arrive there. - We have two programs of disconnection, a light one and a stronger one. - OK, but should I do anything to use the light one? - No, no, it is routine. - If you speak with somebody, it automatically starts working, that's all. - And the other one? - It's just like that. - Like that? - Yes, but be careful with this one you needs to use your descriction. - Because it shakes them up. - After they've been disconnected, they start to speak and act truthfully. - Sometimes this makes them advance five centuries. - This program's intense. - We can send you more programs, if you want, just call us. - Disconnect a group of them, then if you want, come back, that's all. - Mila? I'v made you footwear. It's not practical and it's hurts your feet, but I put in lamb's skin to make it softer. And also a dress Amperor, just like that. - Thanks. - And also a hat. - Ok. Do you think it's very serious if I don't take the hat? - If you want, but tell me, why do you want to go there? Your father told you something? - Yes, just before dying. - And what did he say? - That he had fallen in love with a woman from Earth, who died delivering his child, that the baby was me, that he had brought me back here secretly and that's why he never wanted to get married. - Have you ever told anybody about that? - Nobody. What would happend I had told the truth? - Your father was very afraid that we would return you to Earth. - You mean that you would've dispelled me? - Perhaps, no one like the earthling's too much here. - Oh no, you are such a racists. - No, but I need to say that's hard to handle earthlings, you know. - Yes, but me, I was just a baby. - Yes, but it is not always easy to support the partly-gifted. - I thank you. - No, but not you, you one of us now. - I think, that my sons suspect something, they are very gifted in telepathy. - It's inherited. - And who was she, my mother? - She was like your daughters, very unusual, your father was crazy about her. - What is she saying? - I don't know, I can't hear, there's interferance it makes disturbance, I think, that she speaks about our grandmother. - Oh yeah! - And that she's angree with the racists, something like that. - Oh yeah! - You won't find out anything, really. It's been 200 years for them that's eight generations, they die young. - I know, but I'm half way throuth my life, I want to know the my mothers family. - When are you going to come back, mum? - I'm not going to be a long time, Mezai make sure the children do their telepathy exersice. - Yes, yes, don't worry. And you shouldn't eat all cherry tree. - Mum, can we sleep at the neighbour's? - Yes, but you don't play up all night. - Mum, can I swim across the lake? - No, you don't go far to the lake, you go with Mezage. You watch them, ok? - Yes, yes, don't worry. - Why do you want to go there? - To know where I come from. - Huh? - Oh, the big trees. They are so beautiful! This odd grey thing which covers everything. We would say that they don't have soil here. How do they make plants grow? Oh, what is it overthere? It's a poo. And other one. Oh my, don't they have toilets. Luckly, I have man's footwear. Looks like there is somebody here. I am going to try my program of language. Guten Tag. Vershtehen Sie, was ich sage? - I say to you that I don't speak English! - Et coste loka tishe? - No comprando! And now when I speak like this, do you understand me? - Are you messing with me? - Excuse me Madam, which of these the languages you speak? Is it German, Frenchman, Spanish? - Are you absolutely insane? You think you can act like this becose you're dressed for a carnival? Excuse me, I'm working here!!! I don't have time to talk to everyone who passes! - Thank you Madam. Wow, they're not very friendly here seems this dress I wear makes it worse. - Hey Nicole, what are you doing? - But you know that we have had these cakes for three weeks! - Excuse me Sir, could you tell me in which country we are in here. - You are in France. - Oh, tremendous, and what is the name of the city? - What city? - This one. - What do you mean, this one? - This city here? - Are you messing with me, we are in Paris! - Oh, thank you, I'm sorry, I didn't know. Thank you, Sir. - Damn, I am sick of it! I am sick of it! - Oh my. This air. This must what they call pollution. Oh, it's hurts. I definatly need to find some water to call home. I don't see a single dress I wear on the horizon. I look like a moron in my dress. And all these cars. And noise. This does't seems to upset them this noise. These must be houses, these big grey thing. The poor people, all stuck up indoors. Near this noise. There're not many trees, but they're beautiful. What can they possibly carry in these bags? Why do they have all bags like that? They look a bit off-colour. There are all sick! It's the stomach. The stomach, the heart, the liver. The stomach... These parts of scrap metal which they hang on their ears, on their neck. This must be some type of primitive religious symbols. Why did I deteste archaeology in class, I was very stupid. Ah, it would be useful for me now, the archaeology. Is that a soil? Oh, why they put their soil there? What is that? Is it an exhibition of dead bodies? He cut a piece and gave it to the lady. Excuse me Madam, what is it you took? - I took nothing. - In your bag? - It's my meat. - What is it for? - To eat. - Oh, you are carnivorous? - Are you messing with me or what? - No, in no way! I'm sorry, can I ask you one more thing? - Was it the money that you gave to the man, the square thing? - What square thing? - You gave him a thing. - Yes, I paid for my meat. - Oh, it was the money, you pay just like that? I mean always, to get things? You have no money - you have nothing? Oh my, it's still here. They didn't abolish the money. Where do they put their water? For 1 hour walk, I would have of crossed a stream. It's not a desert here. If there are trees, there must be some water. Excuse me Sir, I'm absolutely not making fun of you but can you please tell me - Where can I find some water around here? - What do you mean making fun of me? - I mean I'm asking you seriously, where can I find some water not too far from here? - What do you mean some water? - Some water to drink. But more impotantly water to dip my feet in. - Are you making fun of me? - Oh no, I swear I'm not! - There's a bistro there! - Oh, bistro... - Is there some water in a bistro? - You make fun of me, Madam! - They must have a different definition of water! But what I can see overthere? There is some water. What do they put in it? Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? It's Mila. Yes, it goes well. Yes. Yes, I arrived well in Paris, yes. Bravo for precision. And there are trees here, there are extraordinary trees. And Ozam, are you there? So, tell me, where is that place you hid your gold? Because I have a problem, they didn't abolish the money. No, no, you have no money, you have nothing. That's right. Ah? Where's this? Some kind of big shed? With many chairs inside and coloured windows? How you say? Notre Dame de Paris it's called? OK! Good, you think that thing still exists there? Ah, here is the shed. It is beautiful! It's a pity that they don't put trees inside but it's not to bad. Oh look, this is a guy from our home. Oh my, it's that poor guy who we sent to them 2000 years ago, they crucified him. It's Jesus, this guy. Oh God, this gives me chills down my back. - What are you doing, madam? - I'm taking some gold. - What're you going to do with it? - I'm going buy myself something to eat. - Is it like money? - No, it is gold. - I have some money. Here, look. - Ah, the same square thing as the lady gave for the corpse. - I can buy myself many bonbons with this. - And if I give you a coin like this one, can you give me what you eat there? I am hungry. - Yes, but I don't need your coins, because coins are not worth very much. - Oh? - My banknote is worth more than your coins. - Oh, OK. Here is someone I can talk to without getting worked up. Here it is. So tell me, do you know who he is? - Sure, it's Jesus. - Oh, you know him. And do you know why they put him there? - When he was born, it is Christmas. - Yes. - I got a gun and a car for Christmas. - Loic, Loic. Come here! - Oh good, a crucified guy equates to a gun and a car. It's very stupid. - Where did you find this? - Oh my! I understand why they're so ill here. This thing shreds your stomach! Oh, I'm going to have to find a resolution. Hello, do you hear me? Hello? Yes, I found gold, but it's worth nothing anymore. No, it's the banknotes which are worth something. Papers. And then, I saw one statue of Jesus. Crucified. No mistake! Then issue to drink and to eat, it's a disaster. I can swallow nothing, it makes me ill. It's going to be necessary to connect me up on the exchange program with new born. Oh, I think that they should have new born here. OK, go for it. Waw, thank you. - Wait, wait, what are these threads you're wearing? - Threads? - Damn, these are such a nice cloths, I have never seen clothes like that! What material is this? What is this? Bio cardboard? Oh shit, it's new-age in death! And pomps they are bluntly too lethal! And plush pomps, it's my dream! Without kidding around, where did you found them? Where is it? Where is it? Tell me an address. - Address, it's not very near, it's quite far even. Is it your style? - Is this my style? Are you kidding me! - Destroye Sissi Imperatrice, it is my dream! - And if I give you my dress, can you tell me where I can find a new born? - Umm... damn yehh. - And then you give me your threads? - Yehh! - Oh, this way, I can feel them. Somewhere here... around here. Oh, I am hungry, I can't take any more. Oh, she's so pretty, maybe my mother was like her... Oh, you don't look very well. Come here my baby. Come. We are going to take care of you. Oh look, you have a fever. - Yes, yes my baby, I'm here. Here is your milk my treasure. Hey, why are you here, Madam? - I am at home. - But what're you doing with this baby? - I recharge it and I recharge myself. - I'm not making fun of you, I assure you. - Are you from the family? - What family? - Are you Serbian? - What? - I tell you, that if you hurt this baby... - I won't make any harm to it, I'm helping it. Look, it has no more fever. It has a big problems, this baby. - What do you mean problems? - It has no mother. - How do you know that it doesn't have mother? - Oh, I know it, I feel it. - It has one, but she left it yesterday. She said, that she was going to get newspapers, and she didn't come back. - She won't come back? - She was raped by the Serbians. - By whom? - If she goes back to her Bosnian family with a Serbian baby, they both will be dispeled. - Oh, dispel? But how?! - Why did you come to take it? - No, I didn't come to take it, it's only to recharge me. Look out, the boss is coming. - Who? - It still has a fever? - Yes, but this morning it's almost. - Yes or no? - It kind of does. - The mother, she didn't come back? - No, she didn't... - And her, who is she? - Oh, I don't know. I found her... - Who are you, Madam? - Sorry? - Put the baby in its cradle. - If you want. - It belongs to you, this baby? - Was she here before? - I don't think so. - Does she knows the mother? - I don't think so. - Then why is this baby in her arms? - I was about to... - You can direct all these questions to me, you know. - Were you on guard duty? - Do you always interrupt people like that? - I beg your pardon? - No, don't beg my pardon. - I just want to ask you if you're always like that? - What do you mean, like that? - I mean you never listen to people here, but it's a lot more practical to listen when someone talks. - Madam, do you know who are talking to? - To you, I'm talking to you. - Professor Max Varron, head of this service. - Oh, you are head of this service... - Yes, Madam. - That's why I find it difficult to communicate however he's nice. - Are you from the family of this child? - This chiled, yes, it is possible. - You will tell to the mother of this child that if she wants to leave... - I've just arrived in France I don't know anything. - And definitely, you will explain this to police. - I don't know the Police. - Excuse me. - I'm going to disconnect him to see. - The only way to get this baby back to its mother, is to make that woman... How beautiful. Beautiful! But... why is your hair like, Gerard? You have very curly hair, Gerard. I had never noticed. - Excuse me, mister Max, Can I talk to you for a moment? Here it is Sir, my name is Mila, I come from another planet, I need your help. - Yes, the first thing I need, is for you to let me come here to recharge myself in energy because I can neither drink nor eat your water and food. - Neither drink nor eat? - But if I grip a baby in my arms for some hours I am recharged for two or three days, on top of that it's good for it too. - Oh, on top of that. - And then I would need a guide to know, who I'm suppose to disconnect, you understand? ...for you to disconnect, yes. - It would be best if I could stay at your place, so that we discuss all of this. - My place? - You do not worry, I would not set up. I can sleep at your place outside. - Euh, there is a balcony. - Oh, great, there we go! - Excuse me, Max, but we quickly need to finish follow-up visits, you have two deliveries on the way. - Two deliveries? But I've never delivered a baby. - What? - And it's you who must deliver the baby, it's you, the wise woman, no? - What? - But I don't know how to give birth, I know nothing about it. I'd make it worse, I pull, I push, I cut, I do Caesarian section, I watch monitor, I do epidural, but I have never delivered a baby! I have never realy looked, or listened, or learnt! I only intervened when I had to because I was too afraid. Because me, I don't know how to give birth. You understand? - Yes, yes, you understand very well. - Umm? - Go to it, go to it, you'll do this much better than me! - And then you tell me. - Good morning madam Deniau. - Good morning. - How are you doing? - Yes, I am a bit down of the bottom but apart from this, it's fine. - Ah yeh, did you feel a lot of pain? - Ah yeah, but it could be worse, but it's really a bit like... - Tell me, how does the baby come out. - How does it come out? - Yes. - It's a bit like a dish of spaghettis which gets slurped outside of you. - You see? - Ah right? - And then the pain stops, you see? - Yes? - And then they put the baby on your belly and you feel it's weight. - But outside, you see? - Yes. - It's difficult to explain... - Here is the small balcony. This will do? - Ah very well, Thank you very much. - Ah, my wife is coming. - Good evening. - Florence, may I introduce you Mila who is going to live on the balcony for a while. - What? - Good evening, Madam, I take up just a small space, don't eat, but I need water. Do you have some water - Some water? - In the bathroom? - There's a bath. - Can I see? - There. - Oh, great. There is no water in the fountain? - What fountain? - This here. - Oh, the tub! - Yes, there is no water? - Oh, yes, yes there is some water but you need to fill it up. - Oh yes, and how does it fill? - Oh, you turn it on. - Where? - Here with the tap, this is a hot water and this is a cold water. - Oh, all right, the tap. Oh yes... Cold? Cold. Thank you, thanks a lot. - But you need to block it. - What I need to block? - The tub. - Oh yes, to block the tub, yes. - What is all this about? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I just don't know. I know nothing anymore. - Yes, I found of new born. I feel a lot better. I have some water and I've already disconnected one of them, it's going well. - Who's touched my walkman? I am fed up here! - What's wrong with it? - It's my favourite show! It is very blurred. I'm sick of this place! You always let Sophie play with my stuff! But what's wrong with TV? The TV doesn't work now! Sophie! - What? - I am sick of your stupidity, I forbid you to touch my walkman and the television! - I didn't touch anything. - Calm down, Raul. - It is you who brock the TV. You both don't know how to use appliances. - Raul, gives me the walkman. - What? Why? - Everything goes well, I thank you very much for... - Oh the TV is working! And my walkman also! You give it to me? - Turn off this TV please! - Huh? - Turn it off. - What's wrong with him? - He need to go to bed early this evening, he must be tired. He's recieved a small dose of disconnection, this really shakes. - One what? - A small shock. - No, this is mad, someone could steal them from us. You can't just leave them there. - How could I have let this happend? - What? - Some say that the children are the mirror of their parents. - Huh? - I must be a stupid bastard! - Are you sure, that you don't want any blankets? - Oh no, no, certainly not, I thank you very much - good night. - Good night. - He's absolutely crazy, our papa, you know what he did? - He's left the TV and my walkman on the sidewalk and he said that from today we are going to speak to each other in this home. Crazy. - You shelter homeless people now? - Florence, am I a stupid bastard? - What do you mean, a stupid bastard? - A moron, an idiot, a man who consisted of nothing and who lives on a edge of existance. - Oh, this without a doubt, yes. - Yes what? - A moron, an ideot, on a edge of existance, it is you. - Is that true? Then why do you stay with me? - For your bank account, my darling, lawful prostitution. - Seriously, why? - And yes. I also live on a edge of existance. - Oh good morning! You slept well? - Oh yes, very well, I just understood that... - It seems that you like Rock and Roll. - What? - This music you're listening to... - Oh yes, it's very cheerful. But this would kill me if you don't stop it, because there... - You want me to stop the music? - Yes! Definately! - Oh, it's exhausting this music thing. - You don't listen to music at home? - Oh no, not anymore. We have concerts of silence. - Ah! Of silence. - Yes, but we had music before and we even sent one musician to you from our home, a tremendous guy, but it was long time ago. - Oh really? You see all this, it's music, they sell only music here. Do you want to listen anything? - Yeah, I am listening right now. - What do you mean, listening? - The discs there, as you say. - You can hear them? - Yes. I concentrate and I hear them, I can give them to you to hear, if you want. - All right! - Here. I can also make everyone hear them. - Oh yeah? How? - I connect up the disc to the thing in the store there, I don't know what you call it. With waves. You want to hear? - Yes, I do. - Hmm, this one then. It's Jean Sebastian. He's the one I told you about. He came from our home, we had sent him to you. - Who? - Jean Sebastian! - From time to time we still sing songs of his. - That one. I'll also take those two. Here you go. - Thank you. - You hear anything? - She could really call us from time to time heck. - On 3 we try all together: One, two, three. - Hold on, I have strange buzzing in my ear. - What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. - You want a vase for your flowers? - They are for you. - For me? - This can not make up for our life. - I was just going to disappear. - Oh? - I'm not leaving you, it's me who I leave. - Yes? - There is dinner ready, if you want. - No, thank you, I am going to pass on it I go to the hospital to recharge a bit. - Oh yeah? - Can I ask you for something? - I'm sorry, but can I see what is in your bag here? - In my bag? Yes, of course. - Because I really wonder what you cary in it. - Oh, not a problem. - This, it's to open houses, right? And what is this thing for? - It's a red lipstick. - Oh? And what is it for? - It's to put it on lips. Like that. - Oh yeh? On lips? - Is it a medicament? - No, it's not a medicine, it's to be pretty. - To be pretty? - To be sexy. - Sexy? - Yes, to be attractive. - Oh, to whom? - To everybody. - It must be difficult to do this. - So that they love you. - Oh, I see. It's a kind of medicine so that everybody loves you, is that right? - Yeah, but no, it's not quite that. - And if you don't put it on, nobody will love you, that's right? - Yes, but... It's difficult to explain... - Is it what I said? I hurt you? - No no, it's nothing, it's... nothing. - And this? - A photographs. This is Max, my parents and the children. - I see, it's people who you love, is that right? But then why don't they have a lipstick on their lips? - Hello. You're crying? What's happened? - Thay'll come to take it tomorrow. - It's mother? - No, DDAS. - Who's that? - Welfare services, I won't see it any more, nobody will be caring for it. - Keep it then. - Are you crazy? We don't kidnap a child just like that, you need to have documents. - Documents? - Yes documents, which say that he exists. - Exists? - No! He has lungs, cerebrum, brain and hart; but if he doesn't have documents he doesn't exist. - My ears are buzzing again. - We'll try again tomorrow. - Sonia! Sonia! Quickly I need to go back to the hospital to work. We took the baby; this lady is going to sleep here tonight. - Oh the baby, let me see it. Oh, what're we going to name it? - Theodore. - Why Theodore, it's an old name, Theodore. - This means that God gave him to us, a something like that. - Oh yeah? How's it going my Theodore? - Can I hold baby for a bit? - Sonia, will you give Theodore to... What was your name again? - Oh yeah, to Mila Here, this's his bottle, heat it up for him in hot water, overthere there're his nappies. - Do you have a bath? - We'll wash him in the washbowl. - Yes, but not for him, for me. - And you are sure that it was his mother? - Yes, I'm sure, I know, she gave birth here. - And you just let her take him? - Yes, it was his mother. - You should've stoppet her! - But why? I was happy that she came back. - Yes, but, you knew that we were suppose to take the baby this morning. - Sonia, Sonia, - They said that they were going to investigate! - Macha? She's a very good girl. - She's been working in this service for two years now, there've never been any problems. - She said, that it was the mother of the child who had come to take it. - Well, if she said so, then it's true. - Oh, absoulutely not. The mother, we found her through refugees organization, she never came back to the hospital, she actually left her baby. - Where's this baby then? - Oh finally, there you are. - Hello mummy, how is it going? - We're very well, so what's like, overthere? - Tonnes of cars, there're poos everywhere and the food issue is really complicated. - Do you think that you can show me where you are now? - Wait I'll try to send you a picture. - Wait somene's coming.

I have a feeling, something's coming. Oh my God, they're coming. They're very close. Quickly, hide youself! With the baby! - I don't know. I have a feeling that they're coming. They want to take the baby. Hide somewhere! - But where? - Go upstairs, quickly! - Hurry up, Sonia. - Miss Macha Belled? - No, she doesn't live here any more. - Oh yeah! Since when? - Since I am here. - And when is that? - Well... about six months. - Nevertheless, they gave us this address at her workplace. - Oh yeh?

There are nappies but... ...but these thing seldom go the one without another. - Oh yeah? - Thank you. - They'll come back, I'm screwed, I'm absolutely crazy to have done this. By taking this child I risk going to prison. - You want us to take him back to the hospital? - Why, so they can change you as accesssories. - You know what? - What? - What if we go to the Louvre museum? - OK, why? - I was told that there was a tremendous number of babies paintings in the Louvre museum. - Oh yeh? - Please Ozam. We won't say that you helped us. - But everybody will know it! - We want to go there so much. - Yes, but trips must be discussed in the planet's meetings. - We don't leave just like that without permission! - But please, help us. - But what makes you suddenly to want to go there? - We saw two girls from there. When mum called us. - Oh yeah, two girls? - What was the secret mum told you before she left? - Her mother, your grandmother, she was an earthling. - Oh yeah? - Oh, you see, we need to go to see the country of our grandmother. - Max, we have a little problem here. We all need to stay at your place for a while. - We have a baby with us. - Right! So it was you who took him? - Guys from welfare services are searching for him. - Oh my! - Ladies, gents, we're closing! - Take this. - It's for poos! - Thank you. - And if she calls, what should I say? - The kids are going well, you're keeping eye on them and that we've left. - I'm going to be in trouble! - Just blame us. - You're going so far, just like that, I can't guarante you the accuracy of the landing. - It's not a big deal. - Where did she see tonnes of cars? - Where did she see trees with big green leaves? It's quite nice. - There's not much water, but it looks beautiful. And there is no poos. - And I must say, there aren't many people. - Wait! I hear something! It sounds like singing. - Oh yes. The two of us, we've came from another planet. Oh yes, with pleasure. All right, we'll walk towards the west. - Oh my, they're great. - You realize, they invited us to eat with them right away. They're really welcoming. - And their telepathy is great. - She's being silly, our mam. - What's this, TV again? - I have no TV, no walkman, - I borrowed the TV from a mate. - Turn off this TV right now! - I'm sick of this TV which ruins your brain! You have no more contact with anybody! - It's not TV that ruins my brain! - Oh yeah? What ruins your brain? - I'm sorry for interrupting, can I watch that square thing there? - What thing? - This one. - The TV set? - Yes, I'm really interested, I have never seen this before. And Raul could explain to me how it works, if you don't mind. - Go for It. - So, Mr. Robet, what is your employment plan? - All right, listen, my party and I believe we need to create jobs, jobs, jobs, create more jobs. I need to create any jobs to improve statistic, so that unemployed leave me in peace and go away with full pockets! - I have an idea for one new job then! - Yes? What? - A very easy job, and it won't cost money, one that uses our exless raw material. - This will be dear? - No, absolutely free. - And everybody can do it? - Everybody! - Even the unemployed or are they excluded? - Especially them, no skills required, and we engage them right away, and keep them all busy. It'll bring us grat statistics! - So what is it? - Shit eater! - Shit eater? - Yes. - Shit eater? - That's true, it is an inexpensive raw material. - And everybody can do it. - That's true, especially the unemployed, they already have a habit of doing it. - The problem is, what is that jobs purpose? - No purpose! - But why do we need a purpose if everybody can do it and it bring us good statistics! - What? - Why do we need a purpose if it bring us good statistics! - Yes, that's true. - We'll make a big commercial campaign, with a big picture of the shit eater. We'll engage a very good advertising agency. "Eat the shit and help your society!" And we'll pay it off by their taxes money, so everything continues as before. - That'll work! - They get their benefits and calm down. Besides no one really need a useful jobs! Who said we have limits on employment! - There was a meeting where one guy said to me, if we demolished all this ugly buildings and then started to clean the planet, there would be work for 500 years. Can you imagine that? - Yes, it's because they are mad. Didn't he say what we all gonna do after that? We cannot change our society for such a stupid idea? - That's what I'm saying!!! - It's not our first priority to create something useful, is it? - Somebody help! - Help! No, we don't need to change anything, shit eater is a great idea. - So, unemployed, go to work! - Do the work! - That stuff is funny. - What is this craziness? Sodden, arsehole! - Bloody shit eaters! - Oh, the buzzing starts again. - Ah, here she is! Hello mum. Hi, how's it going? Yes, we're going very well. - And the kids, how are they? - Oh, the kids, we can't give you news about them because... - What do you mean you can't give me news? - Don't get worked up, they're going very well. - Eh mum! We're on the Earth! - It's brilliant! It's in no way as bad as you told us! You know, there're people here, - Who've lived in this country for thousands of years. And they strictly damage nothing on their land! - They're very, very nice. They are all black. - They have the same medicine as us, they have eat well! - And you know, they are great in telepathy! They accepted us right away as though we were from their family. - They are also advanced like us! - The Earth is very beautiful. - Mum, we want to join you, How can we? - I have no idea how to do that, I don't even know where you are. I need to wake Max and we are going to see what we can do. Fine, while you wait I'll send you a program for disconnection, smile when you use it. Get ready, I'm sending it. - Your credit cards, please. Have a good trip. - Yes. - Thank you. - We need to call mum. - There's no water here. - You think it could be in that thing overethere? - Let's see. - No water. It's beautiful. This makes noise. - Is this a music thing? - You think that they still have music? Is it the thing Jean Sebastian had? You know the songs that we sing there? - Oh yeah. Watch out. Somebody's coming. - I found a thing where there's some water. - Where? - Come and see! - You see, there is some water, it runs. - Oh yes, it is definitely yes. It's a bit small, but good. - Hello mum, how are you? We're on the plane, everything's OK, We've been told we arrive at Roissy in 18H30Mins. We don't know what that means. Maybe you will understand? And mum, we're hungry. We couldn't eat what they gave us, because... - Faster, faster! - Passports please. - Are you alright? - I have a feeling that something's wrong. There is a danger! - Hey overethere, stop! You two! Your passports! - That's what I felt. This is Max. - How do you do? - They were disconnected, ah? - I am afraid so. - Excuse me Sir, is it an orchestra? - Yes, why? - And it plays at that moment? - What do you mean at the moment? It plays without stopping. - Even this evening? - Yes, and this evening. It plays the auditorium of the Bastille this evening. Why? - No reason, just asking. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Is it you Macha? - Is it you, Sonia? - Do we know you? - You don't. - But we do. - Oh, that's why... - I hope that they haven't started yet. Two tickets, please. Has it started? - For half an hour. - Oh dear. - Wait, wait, let me re-connect them. I'v made it worse. - You got the lead soloist. We have a problem! - I definitely want to re-try again, but it's too difficult to aim, I risk disconnecting more of them before I succeed. - Oh no, no, leave it as it is. "I'm interested in music, but not the music theory, but you don't have to think to play arpeggios. You want to play a violin, you have only one solution, : o play in the conservatory you need to have a power A power, a power, a power!" - There are many lakes. We all live at the edge of lakes. It's always warm, every evening it rains for one hour. We don't have houses. We sleep in sort of grass nests. When we wake up we go for a swim in the lake. Then we have lunch. We do our washings. And after, we play games to get stronger. - Every family has it's games. For us it's the trapezium, all our family, in fact. - Even the old? - Oh yes, my mother does it and she's 150 years old. - 150?! - Yeah, she has her third set of teeth already. - She has what? - Towards to 135, we have a third set of teeth which grow. You too would have it if you lived that long. And you can live that long. We too once died very young, in our industrial era. There are families who are very skilled in jumps, there're those who walk on ropes. - And who rules the planet? - It's nobody, and everybody. Ve have a planets meeting once a year with delegate from the villages on the summits of mountains. - Why on the summits of the mountains? - Because when we walk two hours up a mountain, we're more clever. Then we have meetings about birth control, once a year in the villages. - Birth control? - We decide how many children we're going to make according to the size of the crop. - In the morning we play a bit just like that. Afterwards we eat. - What do you eat? - Everything, fruits, vegetables, olives, kebabs of raw vegetables, grains. - And some meat? - Oh no! We eat beans. Oh, they are so good, beans! We eat simply. - You don't have fire? - Yes, we do, but we don't use it any more. Only to make some knifes once a year. And then we're harvest our crops. - Loumi! - What? - Come! Come here! - Here. - And after midday we exersize our minds, - We have classes of telepathy, predicting the future, interstellar travel, mathematics of space. - What is a mathematics of space? - It is the strongest discipline. - So Loumi, is going to hide himself. 10, 20, 23. Loumi, come back! - 23! - Yehh! - And you know what will happen in years to come? - No, I don't know this. - Even by concentrating you don't have a visions? - No. - It's a pity. - It's not always joyful to know. - I would like know it so much! - You should ask the boys. - I'm not good in archaeology. - After our industrial era, we had big trials and boycotts. - Trials? - All people who produced damaging products against the health of the men, animals and plants were judged as culprits of genocide and crimes against the planet. - Oh yes, who? - Food and chemical industries, weapon factories, tobacco and alcohol, - pharmaceutical and nuclear industries, car producers, architects, many doctors and politicians, who had become rich by allowing it to happen. - But that's the whole world! - Oh, it was a civil war! And after there was the boycott. - The boycott? - Everything that caused harm we didn't buy any more, or threw it away. It was the ultimate weapon, less purchases, means less power. Even the army and the police could do nothing against the boycott. - What was a name for this era? - Chaos before revival. - Was there really a revival? - Oh yes! - Could you show us how to drive a car? - So you are interested in cars, aren't you? - Excuse us, we're really sorry. - Stupid bastard!!! - We're really sorry. - Stupid bastard!!! What a stupid bastard are you not paying attention? Where do you think you are, bastard? - Do you know how to drive or what, bloody idiot! - Forgive me, Sir. I'm sorry. - Stupid bastard! - I was discussing... - Do you know where you are, you bloody idiot! - I think there's nothing wrong with your mirror. - Stupid bastard! - See. There is no scratch on your mirror. - Do you know how to drive or what, ideot? - Really, I beg for your forgiveness, I ask you to excuse me. - Stupid bastard! - It's so terrible what happened to you! - What? - I say: It is terrible what happened to you! - Strange stupid bastard! - On the Earth, 4 out of 5 people are starving. There are those who live in cellars because of bombs. There are those who are dying of, of AIDS in hospitals. There are women who got raped by 25 men at once to make them understand who's the boss. And there's you. You, who experienced such a terrible thing! We touched your rear-view mirror! - But Sir. Calm down, Sir. And trees above you with leaves moving in the wind. Did you ever look at the trees? And your beautiful wife, who loses her youth to cook mushrooms in cream for you, while you betray her. Have you looked only once at your wife? And your children with the nice smooth skin. Did you ever thank somebody in your life for the smooth skin of your children? And there're the cows, which produce milk, cheese and butter for you every day. Have you ever said thanks to the cows?! - You are mad, Sir! - Your life is beautiful, for God sake! It's beautiful, beautiful, worth dying for. Look at my wholesale trade there! But there's only one problem, that we touched your rear-view mirror! It is terrible! It is terrible! - Thank you! I'm sorry! Thank you! I'm sorry. - Is it the whole world is in our home or what? - I'll explain later. - I think we need to go back. - What's a rush? - But the kids are alone... - But there is Ozam and the neighbours. - I understand, the girls are cute, but... - We love them. - I can see that. - What if they come with us? - With us? Upthere? - What about their family? - Their mother died. - They told us that their father is unemployed and long time alcoholic, I don't know what that means. - They don't even know where he is. - And if they find out they took the baby, they'll put them in prison. - That's true, it's a cute baby. - Mum please. - Well, ask them. - They agree. - Ah, well then... - Hey Mila! My mates father works in the Park of the Princes, he gave me tickets for this evening's match, You think that we could do the same thing we did with tellie? "O. M!!! (Olympian of Marseilles)" - Could you disconnect those players? - Disconnect them? - Yeah! - Hey, help me. - We go on three. - One, two, three! - You stole it? - Just borrowed. - For dancing. - We'll come back, we will bring your baby. - We'll come back to see you again. - Oh, don't cry, Raul. - We'll come to see you. - Here, I give you this. You can disconnect your professors for a little, when they annoy you. But don't fool around! Thank you for everything! - No, you helped me... - No, my program can't give goodness, you had before. - See you soon. - Yes. - Mila! - Mila, come see this! I made new dresses, it's a present for Macha and Sonia. - Yes, the teacher of telepathy said to me that after Ampires dresses, there were Crinoline. - Really, crinolines? They're nice dresses, but what for... - So that they feel at home. - They are nice, thank you. - Is it not a good shape? - They could wear them for parties, or put them for holidays. - Mila! Come and see, quickly come! - What is it? What's causing this? - Mezage and Mesai gave it to us. First they didn't want to show us how to use it! - Oh! What is it? - It's a concert of silence. - Why are you laughing? - It's hard to explain, it's a... - It's our humour, it's because there was... You didn't hear it? - No. - There was suddenly... uh... How can we explain this? - It's difficult in words. - You think that one day we will hear it? - Oh yes! Of course! Especially you. - This will come very quickly to you!
