A FILM BY WIM WENDERS BASED ON THE NOVEL BY PETER HANDKE THE GOALIE'S ANXIETY AT THE PENALTY KICK Stop it! If not, you can go! Offside! That was clearly offside! Even a blind man could see it. Come on! You're sleeping on the job! Do that at home! He's crazy! What an idiot! Can I have this paper? Sure you can. What streetcar do I take into town? There's only one. Give me a stall seat, please. With extra leg-room? Yes. Has the feature started yet? Get off your horses! So you want a room? First floor, number 15. You'll have to go up on your own. The bellhop is off on Sundays. Off? Where do I sign in? You can do it tomorrow. The room's facing the street, but it's not noisy at night. The last streetcar passes at about 12. It's busted. Don't bother. RED LINE 7000 Good night! - Good night! Anything you'd like? - No. Do you have a paper? A Paper? I could give you a detective story. This isn't last night's paper? - No, it's today's. But it has the soccer results? - Yes, sure. Press Q4. Do it yourself. Any other numbers? What's so interesting about those dumb pictures? I might be in one myself. A former national player leased the place a few years ago. Then he went to America and joined a non-league team. A year later nobody ever heard of him again. He had vanished. His wife hired a famous American detective agency. But they didn't find anything either. All they found out was that he was last seen living in a trailer in Tucson, Arizona. In a trailer? We once did a tour of the States. Shall we go somewhere else? Listen to that music! We need a schilling. I put my last one in the jukebox. It won't work without money. Hey, that was a quarter! Do you have a light? Where can I get a paper? - Try the station. I'm leaving anyway. I forgot to leave a note. I'm going to my girlfriend. We wanted to see a movie. Okay. - See you. The Prater, please. Gimme a dime for the streetcar! There you go. - Thank you. Extra leg-room again? - Yeah, leg-room. I haven't any change, I'm afraid. Have you got anything bigger? Do you know this movie? It's about a gang of counterfeiters. I once saw a movie where they forged bills marked 10 dollars on one side and 20 on the other. Do you know that film? No. - But you've seen this one? No, I haven't. THE TREMOR OF FORGERY A BAT FLEW OUT FROM HIS HEAD AND HIT THE WALL. MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT. Come in! The shower woke me up. Sorry. I'm quite glad I woke up. I had a stupid dream, one I've often dreamed. Are there ants in the teapot? Ants? Where there ants in your dream? Each time, I'm wearing a dress made of banknotes. And when I sit down it crackles loudly. I like his voice. Then I look down and realize it's crackling because it's on fire. Freddy grabs the extinguisher from the foyer and runs towards me. It was usually a flame-thrower in my dreams, but this time it spurted water. I was so surprised that I woke up. Then I heard the shower. Who is this Freddy guy? Someone I know. It's Monday. I think I'll do some shopping. Bring me a paper, would you? Did the planes wake you up? I just woke up anyway. The last plane is the mail plane. After midnight. The first Boeing at 6 a.m. leaves for Rio. To where? The Pan Am to Rio de Janeiro. I once had a room looking onto a dead-end street. I didn't even hear any cars. It sort of unsettled me. Living in the city, but not hearing a thing. Yeah, that's not very nice. But I think that an airport... My name's Gloria. What's yours? Gloria... I'm a professional goal-keeper. That explains the bruises. I thought, maybe you were an ice-hockey player or a boxer. I'm Joseph Bloch. I mean, my name's Joseph Bloch. B-L-CD-C-H . I once went to a soccer match with George. It was raining. I almost got hit on the head with a plastic bottle. It was the day Sharon Tate was murdered. Afterwards we went to the "Stefanskeller". I had an Irish coffee. Is George an Englishman? No. We just call him that. The "Stefanskeller" is a restaurant? A bar, a discotheque. I met George at the movies. He complained because I'd given him a seat behind a pillar. So I gave him a seat with leg-room. A guy I know, a defender, plays in my team, his name is Stumm... once scored an own goal. The ball was deflected off his foot into the far corner while I was diving the other way. I was in the right corner, the ball in the left. I mean the left, as I saw it. Or maybe it was the right. Anyway, as far as I can recall, I sat in the wrong corner... in a puddle. Did you give poor old Stumm hell? The defender? No, we'd lost the game anyway. Want some more tea? - Sure. Are you a good goalie? Have you got another job? That's not a jet! No, a propeller plane. Charter flights. Haven't you done much flying? Last year we did a friendly tour of South America. Then we spent a week in the States. What? Didn't you say something? - Me? No... It must have been that noise... This is from Bill, from St. Louis. I collect postcards. He once gave me a quarter. But I put it in a cigarette machine by mistake and it never came out. In Frankfurt. Are you going to work today? To training? Since you stayed away last night, we thought you wouldn't be back. It happens often. 300 schillings. This isn't a doss-house. - Beat it with that light! How dare you! The gentleman made a complaint. Can I see your papers? He knocked the flashlight out of my hand. It could have broken. You've been around a lot. The thing with the flashlight... I didn't mean it. A reflex. But it's not illegal to sleep in a movie theater. It'll be a letter, right? Is that your money? There's a hole in my pocket. They're American coins. Did you lose them? I was in the States recently. You have relatives there? No, I was working. As a sportsman. That's why the coins are so dirty. They were used for the toss-up and fell in the mud. How do you mean? Heads or tails, to see who plays against the wind. Or into the sun. Last stop! Everybody off, please! Good evening. Can I still get a room? Yes, there's one still free. I'll show you upstairs. The key's up there. A woman I know, Hertha Gabler, runs an inn near here somewhere. Have you heard of her? She's leased the Border Inn, near the customs post. I almost took a job with her. Now my step-sister works there. But you have to walk back at night. That was too much for me. What's that noise? A few guys in the bowling alley. Your room's right above it. A crippled school kid has been missing for three days. They think he's been murdered. Maybe he just lost his way. I doubt it. Who loses their way these days? I don't smoke. - They're vacuuming upstairs. MURDER OF A CINEMA CASHIER MUTE SCHOOLBOY MISSING FOR TWO DAYS The boy's not crippled, he's a mute. That's even worse. I wouldn't want to be a mute. Is there a TV set on somewhere? The innkeeper's mother... She sits in the back room all day. She watches the early show for shift workers. She's deaf as a doorpost, but still wants the sound turned on. How do I get to the Border Inn? If you follow this road, heading out of town, you'll find the inn at the point where the paved road... curves back towards town. There's a paved pathway running between the farmhouses which ends in a footbridge at the border. The border is closed. Watchtowers! In any case, the road leads directly to the inn. I'd like two shirts, two underpants, two pairs of socks. Collar size 40. Have you got shirts with high collars that won't slip below the jacket collar? Those, I think. Thank you. - Need any handkerchiefs or a necktie? We have cardigans in stock. No, thanks. But could you mend this by tomorrow? The pocket lining. Is the innkeeper at home, Mrs. Gabler? She's still sleeping. Can you get me a beer? A bottle? Do you know her? Yes, from way back. You should wipe your shoes and shut the door! Her daughter. She's four. A man came here a few days ago. He said he'd been sent to dig out a well. She wanted to send him away. But he wouldn't go until she showed him the cellar. He at once grabbed a spade. She had to get help to get rid of him. Now the kid's scared he might come back. An apricot brandy. Is the missing boy back? - He hasn't been found yet. He's only been gone three days. - But it's cold at night. At least he had warm clothes on. - Yes, he had. He can't have gone far. No, he couldn't have gone very far. Those antlers are from a stag that strayed into the minefield. Has the furniture arrived? Bloch? I haven't seen you for ages. I saw your name in the paper just recently. I have a few days off because of an injury. Do you like it here? I arrived late last night and took a room at the inn. I didn't want to disturb you so late at night. I don't mean the town, I mean my place here. Do you rent rooms, too? I've thought about it. I don't know if I should. Alfons! The son of the estate owner. Don't you want to play in the kitchen? Run along! Don't look at me like that! I'm glad I don't have to put on makeup in the morning. I get dolled up at night. I can't be too glamorous for all the village boys. I put on huge false eyelashes and green eye shadow. And lipstick... You wouldn't recognize me. I would, by your blue eyes. That's my furniture. Give me a hand, Bloch. I've got to fill the closets. Do you want to stay for dinner? No, thanks. I'll drop in tonight or tomorrow. Is there only one room for all the classes? There's just this one room... for all the classes. No wonder the kids can't even talk properly when they leave school. They can't finish one proper sentence. They just talk together in monosyllables. And only if you ask them first. They just learn stuff by heart and then reel it off. Beyond that, they can't even form a whole sentence. In fact, they're all more or less speech-impaired. What's the hurry? To the movies! You have to sign the register form! It's in your room! Pardon me. I thought you were at breakfast. You can come in. You can make the bed now. You misunderstood... you could have come in. I was mistaken. I saw the bus driver leaving and must have taken him for you. I thought you were having breakfast. I didn't mean that. What did you say? There's too much furniture here. That's true. And we haven't got enough staff. I only mistook you because I was so tired. I'm worn out. No, the rooms are too full of closets, dressers and chests. You can barely move. Even talking is hard. What are you trying to say? I didn't want to scare you away! Do you need the lamp to get home? - No, I have a boyfriend... He's a cabinet maker. Are there any double doors here? Nothing's ever been stolen here. And so what's that? I once saw a movie where a thief was trapped between double doors. There are no thieves around here! There's a funny smell outside. One of the neighbors died yesterday. Does the waitress wear orthopedic shoes? That must be the bicycle. What bicycle? The dumb kid's bike. If those shoes came in other colors they'd be fashionable. Did the well-digger come back? He couldn't even shout for help. Who? The boy! Do the border guards on the other side use field glasses? I saw them glinting in the distance. You can't see the watchtowers from here. I'm aware of that! How much is the rent for this place? The estate-owner's son is a friend of mine. What does he do? Oh, Alfons... He's a perfectionist at whatever he does. A few months ago he bought a sports car. He took part in a rally and came in third. Last night I took his car keys away. He drinks too much. It was too far for him to walk then... He manages the estate. His father... is in a sanatorium with TB. What number do you start with when you count? I got into the habit of starting with two. I never count the ones anymore. I was almost run down crossing the road today because I didn't notice the first car, but only looked at the second one. One egg, one roll and one coffee in the morning... aren't enough for me. It almost feels like I didn't have any breakfast. Only the second egg counts. "No comment!" Why do you keep getting up, sitting down, getting up... sitting down again, grabbing this... letting it go again, grabbing something else... What's wrong? What's eating you? Should I check on the kid? - No! She had a bad dream. She'll come looking for some pie soon. What are you doing under the bed? The flies under my pillow! Hold the apple with both hands! Go and ride your tricycle. Flies? The neighbor's kids are sleeping here as long as the corpse is laid out. At night they shoot rubber bands at the flies on the wall. And they put the ones they hit under their pillows. Service! What can I do about it? Now we're alone. What about the kid? - She doesn't count. So how do country people screw? Ride your bike outside! No! Two days ago I saw a woman on the bus... with a bloodstain on the back of her dress. It all happened so fast. We had to wake the kid so she could run to the village. But then she couldn't tell the priest what had happened... and he didn't ring the bells. Go get some wood! You can come in for dinner if you like. A child of ours was struck dead by falling pumpkins. He just gave a snort and died... Stainless steel sink... 2000 to 3000 schillings. Ice cream machine? - 10,000 to 12,000 schillings. What about the jukebox? - It's not mine. I only rent it. Thanks. Is that worth anything? There are lots of stones like that around here. Whenever I see something I have to seize and know nothing about... a washing machine, for example, I always ask about the price. If I see the article again, in this case a washing machine of the same type, I never remember what it looks like, the buttons you press, for example... but always by what that article, the washing machine, cost when I first saw it. I always note the price exactly. That's how I recognize every object. What if something is worthless? I don't deal with worthless things. At least not in my profession. So this isn't worth a thing? Nothing at all! Nothing? - No. My dream's over, then! I trust male hairdressers more than females. Did Charlie call up yet? No, but I just met Frank on the street in his best uniform. With pointed shoes like this! Who is Charlie? He's a soldier, too. And Frank? Well, it's none of my business... Why are you asking, then? I'll stop asking. You ask me something! So what are you? A detective? No, a sportsman. So I've won! A boxer? I'm a goalkeeper. Did you hear? He's a goalie! What's so funny about it? When we saw you last night, we bet whether you were a boxer... Or.. - Or? A foreign legionnaire. Soccer players all have bandy legs. We always stand behind the goal to make the goalie nervous. Our goalie split his top lip in a collision. Now he lisps. You wouldn't make me nervous so easily. The innkeeper's gone to the castle. It's about her lease. There might be a storm today. - Don't bother talking to him! He can't talk when he's got things to do. Did he throw the ashes on the bed again, instead of into the creek? Doesn't he jump at the goats anymore? Does he hack up the pumpkins to smear his face with them? I'll pay this evening. "He had to leave the farm, and then they found him in the woods hanging by his foot from a branch, with his head in an anthill." is this house occupied? - The private rooms are off limits. "The darkness in the pine woods drove him out of his mind." They've found the mute boy's body. A customs officer found him drifting in the stream. AMERICAN COINS CLUE TO GLORIA T. MURDER Yesterday I found 10 cents under your bed. You can keep it. It's a bit late for breakfast. I didn't plan to have breakfast here. Not that I don't like it here. On the contrary! I've got to go now. Am I stopping you? That serves you right! What serves him right? Mr. Schneider, please! Can't you speak up? Training camp... where? I'll repeat that. "We are proud of you and little Andreas." Stop. "His happy grandparents." I got cut off. - I'm sorry. Can you reconnect me? - I can't get through myself. Do you know what an area code is? - Yes. Ever dialed more than three numbers? Ever called the Red Cross or the police? Shall I give you a number to reach information? Did you hear? They found the schoolboy. The cop who found him thought the body was a floating mattress at first. Have you ever been to a play? Once, at school. But it was the film of a play. Last night I dreamed I was supposed to act in a play. I was supposed to perform with all kinds of fire extinguishers... and keep shouting out their prices. What then? That was it. You don't look the scared type at all. Let's go. Give me a hot dog. No movie theaters around here? There's a film on tonight in Windisch. How do I get there? We're going there. You can come along. What's the movie called? "Madigan". I've seen that film! Right at the back, please. And a beer. So you'll stand the drinks tonight, huh? Yeah... Drinks on me for everyone around the table! There could be another bill inside. So what, it's my money! Come on! Why did you keep that? Didn't you pay? Sure, I did. I just kept it in my hand. It doesn't mean a thing. Where are you going? It's raining. I have to get the washing in. It isn't, it's the wind. It's just dripping from the trees. You've lost a shirt. It's only a foot-rag. If your jersey was striped it'd look like a soccer shirt. I bought it in a boutique. What's wrong with it? I've nothing against it. I think it's pretty. Are those false eyelashes? You find fault with everything. I didn't mean it like that. You misunderstand everything. İf I said you looked like a painted cow, you'd believe me. What do you mean, a painted cow? Nothing. It means nothing. But you must have had a reason to say it. Finished your accounts? It's all part of the job when you're running an inn. Do you want a sandwich? I don't mind. I'm not that hungry. Why did you tear off Saturday? It's only Friday. It is tomorrow already. It's 2:30 a.m. I've already torn it off for tomorrow. So we'll have to sleep all day and get up on Sunday. Can I have a knife, too? - There's one there. What are you doing? Can't you hear? The kid's crying. Careful! It's dripping! That's exactly what I want. The kid wants a light. If I leave the door open it's too loud for her. I wish she was a bit older. I'd have more time to look after the inn. Wherever you go here, you meet these old stooped women in black. The estate-owner's son has an eye on you. Did he propose to you already? He's as good as married. I didn't mean it that way. You're a real pain in the neck. You as well. You drive me crazy! You constantly create disorder. You leave the drawer open, throw your coat on the floor, tear off the calendar for no reason, say stupid things... Why did you turn on the radio? You'll be dropping the ashtray next. I've got a feeling I have to let it go. Would it be asking too much to borrow an umbrella to go home? I'm afraid I relied too much on the official weather report, and they forecast a rainless night. But the bubbles on the puddles are a sure sign it will rain for a while. I'll come with you. The umbrella is hanging under the work-pants. Your coat! I'll bring the umbrella back tomorrow. Goodnight! Good night! I almost stepped on a hedgehog! How can you tell in this darkness? That's part of my job! Whenever you hear or see something, you have to be able to identify where it came from. Even something that's right on the periphery of your vision. You have to identify its color, although color can only be registered in the center of the retina. We haven't got much to do around here. Since they mined the border the smuggling's stopped. There's less tension, you get tired, and you lose your concentration. And if anything does happen, you don't even react. If someone crosses your path, you don't know how to tackle him. You have the wrong stance, and even if you're in the right spot you rely on the colleague beside you to grab him, while your colleague does the same and relies on you, and the guy escapes. When you stand face to face you have to look the other in the eye. You can tell which way he'll run by the direction of his eyes. But at the same time you have to pay attention to his legs. Which leg is he standing on? That one indicates the direction he's going to run to. But if he's trying to fool you and wants to run the other way, he has to shift his weight to the other leg and lose time, so you can grab him. Well, there are no rules really. You're at a disadvantage as the other guy's watching you too, and sees your reaction. All you can do is react. And if he's taking off, he'll suddenly change direction, and that leaves you standing on the wrong leg. I'm saving up for a house of my own. I was born here. How about a shot of something? No, thanks. It's stopped raining anyway. Thank goodness. Okay, best of luck. The mail plane. Half past three! It's pouring down, and my umbrella's broken, too. It's quiet here. No bowling tonight? A big tourist group is sleeping on camp-beds in the bowling alley. But there's a bed left for you! Of course. So you won't be coming upstairs with me? No! Are you too tired? That, too! Open LID, please! Oh, sorry! The breakfast isn't for you. Excuse me! - I'll have breakfast downstairs. Would you mind having breakfast next door? The tourist group hasn't left yet. Do they read a lot of newspapers around here? Mainly magazines. The daily papers are read by the guests. He's bound to have grown a mustache by now. And dyed his hair. They've released the Gypsy. The mute schoolboy died accidentally. HOT LEAD IN GLORIA T. MURDER CASE DEATH OF MUTE SCHOOLBOY CLEARED UP With this wind they should keep the ball low! You know what teams they are and how they're ranking? I'm a stranger, too. I don't know what's what. I'm a salesman, just passing through. There's too much shouting. A good game is played silently. There's no coach to give them instructions from the sidelines. On such a small field you have to pass the ball quickly. I was once in the stadium and saw a player break his leg. You could hear it crack even up in the stands. I once played against a team of only barefoot players. The smacking sound as the feet hit the ball was chilling. Have you ever tried keeping your eye on the goalie and not on the forwards running at him? It's hard to look away from the strikers and the ball... You have to tear your eyes away. Instead of the ball, you watch the goalie running backwards and forwards, bending over left and right, shouting at his defenders. Usually you only notice him when the ball is shot at the goal. It's a funny sight: the goalie without the ball but expecting the shot. I can't look there long. My eyes are drawn back to the forward. It's as if you were cross-eyed. When a man walks up to a door, you don't look at the handle! It gives you a headache. You can't even breathe right. You get used to it. But it's ridiculous. A Penalty! The goalie wonders what corner the guy's going to aim for. If he knows the player already, he knows the corner he usually picks. But maybe the penalty kicker will consider the goalie's reaction too. So the goalie in turn thinks he'll chose the other corner, for once. But what if the penalty kicker still thinks like the goalie and shoots the ball into the usual corner, after all? And so on, and so on. Bravo! Subtitles: Alex Zuckrow et al. Eurotape Media Services 2014
