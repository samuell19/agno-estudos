And you're sure you wanna tell me your story? Yeah. Okay. State your name. Tristan Harris. Where do you want me to start? I couldn't say. It's not my story. Ahhhh. Oh, god, the quality. Vinyl, it's so much better, don't you think? You know, they should put record players in machines, uh, cars, nowadays it's all about the digital. With their iPods, the cellphones with the Bluetooth. Just listen. Listen. Open up your heart, chappy, and listen. There's just so much more authenticity to vinyl. Not to mention the joy that you get from going to the store and purchasing a physical vinyl record to take home and play. There's nothing compares to that. I much more prefer that. I don't understand why more people don't prefer that. What else I don't understand is all these different interrogation techniques. You've got good cop, bad cop. Dismemberment, torture. Too much work, it's like the expression you Americans say. To go around your zoopa to get your elbow. I could torture you in more ways than you can pray against, chappy. But I don't want to get blood on this shirt. My mother gave it to me, she would kill me. But you know what I find, chappy? I have alternative method. The key, chappy, is family. If I get your father, your daughter, your son, your mother, or your wife, then, chappy, then you'd tell me what I want to know. Would you like to test this theory, chappy? You don't believe me, let's find out. Time to spill your guts, chappy. All right, I'll give you what you want! See, chappy? I rest my case. I have the information. The chaplain. Dah, he is naive. Dah, dah. Get them out of Witness Protection, and Tristan will come to you. Tristan. The man who defied his god in order to save his daughter. Look out for him, man. This is a true gangster. An outlaw. Where's my wife and daughter? Where's my wife and daughter? My apologies. Where's my wife and daughter? Straight to business. I can respect that. Your respect isn't worth the bullet to kill it. You are an example man. You learn by example, do you not? Depends on what I'm trying to learn exactly. Exactly who you are dealing with. We were missing you today. We made a poster. I love it. We all really miss you, so we really want you to come back. Tell everybody I miss them, too. We will. Bye. Did you sleep okay last night? Good, how's your headache? It feels better than it did yesterday. Good, can you open your eyes and follow my finger? Does the light hurt your eyes today? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's take a listen. Okay, deep breath. Good, does that hurt? - Mm-mm. - Good. Okay, can you sit up for me? All right. Good deep breaths. Good. Covered back up here. Hi. Hey. Have y'all heard any results yet? We have, why don't we talk in the hall? She's kinda tired, you get some sleep, okay? I'll be right back. You know we've done a variety of tests over the last few days and the last test that we did was a CAT scan of her brain and it shows that she has a brain tumor called a glioblastoma. It's rare in children, but it is a fairly aggressive form of cancer. So we're gonna have to do surgery or how do you fix this? She'll need surgery as soon as possible. That's her best chance for survival. You know... I never thought any of this was possible. That this could happen to us, to Maggie. She's 10 years old. 10. She's got her whole life left to live. I just don't understand any of it. Any of it, and I know that we're not the only parents that this will happen to, but it's so different. When it's your kid. And I wanna have faith. I really do. And I'm tryin' to be so strong for you. And for Maggie, and I feel so guilty. That I'm failin' you as a husband and her as a father. You are the strongest man I know, any mother would be lucky to have you as a father for her children. This is not easy. It's hard on me, too. But we cannot lose our faith. Honey, without faith, we don't have hope. - Yeah. - We have to remain faithful. Without Maggie, though. I don't have any faith. Tristan, if you lose your faith, and Maggie sees her daddy giving up, how is she supposed to respond to that? Maggie's dying. She's going to die. You heard that doctor. That doctor does not decide her fate, any more than we do. God does. I know that you're scared. And I know that you're angry, I get it. Maggie is in the hands of the great physician. She is in the best place she can be. There's no one more equipped to make her better than God, and you have to believe that, you can't let that go. You're the man of this house, honey. You're gonna be accountable one day. I can't fight death! Our daughter is going to die. Daddy, why are you yelling at Momma? Hey, hey, listen. It's okay, all right? Let's go back upstairs. Hold on, Momma. Dad, we're going to be all right. I'm going to be all right. You and Momma are going to be all right. How do you know that, sweetie? Because I have faith, Daddy. Come on, sweetie, let's go to bed. Bankers. I don't understand, I mean, this is why we have insurance. I mean, you can't do this. Well, what if... Well, what if we get a second opinion? What do you mean that there's nothin' that you can do? I mean, this is why we pay you guys. So when somethin' like this happens, that you guys are there to pay for it. I'll call you back. Is everything okay? It's just an angry customer, how was school? Bad. Why was it bad? Well, I don't wanna go to school anymore. Why don't you wanna go to school, Maggie? Just... I want to spend more time with you and Momma. Maggie, I wanna spend as much time as I possibly can with you. I understand, but you have to go to school. Just like I have to work. You gotta make good grades so that you can get into college, get a good job, raise a family. Okay, everything gonna be fine. We both know that I'm not gonna make it into the next grade. Why do you say that, Maggie? I'm dying, Dad. Maggie, don't say that. We both know that. I can't do anything about it. Momma can't do anything about it. Maggie. - I don't wanna die. - Maggie! Maggie, you are not gonna die. You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna do whatever I have to do, whatever it takes. Nothin' is gonna happen to you. I promise. Okay? We are gonna figure this out and we are gonna get through this as a family. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm sure. You're gonna be fine, I promise, okay? Okay. Are you Mr. Johnson? Yeah, give me one second here. Go ahead and have a seat. All right, Mr. Harris, thank you for coming in today. I wanted to talk to you about your insurance. It appears that you've already capped out your insurance policy. What does that mean? It looks like when you originally bought this policy, you bought it with a tier one catastrophic event, which means that we'll pay up to $25,000 for, um, medical expenses. Wait, wait, wait. A tier one? Yes, sir. Yeah, there's actually three tiers. Can we just elevate it to another tier? Unfortunately it's not the way the insurance policy works. Now, this would be considered a pre-existing condition, and we're not able to change your policy at this time to... Well, rewrite the policy. Well, unfortunately, I can't just rewrite this policy. Why not? That's just the way that these policies were originally written. Well, she needs the operation right now. I understand, sir. You keep sayin' that but I don't feel like you understand, do you have kids? I do have kids. What would you do in a situation like this? Well, unfortunately, knowing the way the insurance programs work, I don't see that there's really anything you're going to be able to do right now. I'm afraid I've done all I can to help you with this. Well, I don't see how you've done that. Would you like the paperwork to file a grievance? Well, sir, that's really the only option that we have right now. You're sure you wanna do this? What are we gonna do? I don't like this, either! This isn't easy for me. I don't like seein' her sick. And I certainly don't like seeing her afraid. I don't wanna lose my daughter! I will do whatever I have to do to take care of her. There's nothin' to worry about. I promise you, okay? I promise you. You do whatever it takes. Because she deserves a fighting chance. You're sure you wanna do this? Yes. It's the only way. You know there's no goin' back from this, right? Yes. Look. I don't think you do. Tristan, this decision isn't just something you can walk away from when you want to. You go through with this, and this'll be with you for life. The only way you walk away from this, is to be dead or in jail. And jail would just buy you time. Tristan, these people don't care about you. If you're in jail, they will find you. Goin' through with this is not only puttin' yourself at risk but it's puttin' your entire family at risk. My family's already at risk. Look. I know why you're doing this. I understand, but there has to be a... You don't understand anything, kid. I have no choice. Every man has to be his own man, I guess. Bein' a man has nothing to do with it. Then what's it about, then? This is about a father's promise to his daughter. Is Val coming or not? Any minute now. He's bringing the money, right? Yeah, he'll have the money. Last chance, Tristan. Hand sanitizer. We can't get this at home. Russia. You like to fix things, I hear. It's how I make a living. So, why do you need my money? My daughter, Maggie. How old is your daughter, Tristan? She's 11 and I need the money, for her operation, and I'll do whatever it takes to pay for it. I'm glad to hear this. Are you? Yes, I am. Mr. Harris. You know what this is? That's my daughter's second chance. Wrong. Mr. Harris, this is slavery. We're all slaves to something, I guess. Interesting. But wrong again. Mr. Harris. If you take this money, I own you. You belong to me. You will do everything that I tell you to do, when I tell you to do it, and how to do it. Mr. Harris, this is not a one-and-done type of situation that we have here, this is not your average part-time job. If you come to me later and you say that your daughter is all better and you no longer need to work for me, do you know what I will do to you, Mr. Harris? Kill your daughter, right in front of you. And then I will kill your pretty wife. And then I will kill you. I'll even kill the family dog for the cherry on top. I'm sure the kid came here today to try to talk you out of this. Because he knows everything that I'm telling you is the truth. Sometimes, family decisions, tend to cloud a man's judgment from right and wrong. I tell you what I will do for you, Mr. Harris. I will give you one hour to decide whether you want to take this money. It does not bother me, one way or the other. This is strictly business. One hour, Mr. Harris. Kid, you come with me. One hour, kid. If he does not take the money, kill him. Yes, sir. Dead. All right, so let me get this straight. Your daughter had a glioblastoma? Yeah, but it wasn't the deadliest of forms. Is she okay? We'll get to that. Okay. Tell me again, why couldn't the insurance pay for this? Because of the type of surgery that it was, the cost, it put us outside of our tier or category, whatever we were in. Got ya. So, you and your wife couldn't afford the surgery. So, you gotta work for some gangster and he paid for it? Yes. What, you didn't have any other avenue? Friends, family, a bank, I don't know, your church? Look, we didn't have time to come up with the money. As soon as we found out about the surgery, we had to do it. Got ya. So, what happened next? What you watchin'? Nothing, I was trying to research some new insurance policies. - Did you find any? - Seems they'd cover Maggie. - Did you find any? - No. No, not yet. Where have you been? Did, uh, did Maggie go to school today? No, she didn't feel up to it. We just stayed at home and watched movies all day. I fixed her some supper. Did she hold it down? No, she threw it up. But I managed to get her to go to sleep. Yeah, I saw that, I just tucked her in. Turned the light off. I think half the problem was the fact that we didn't know where you were. Where were you? What is that? Where did you get that? Is that to us? Tristan, where did this come from? The pastor called me and told me to come to his office, so I went to his office and he gave me that check. I cannot believe this. Yeah. Somebody from the church, I guess, found out about Maggie and, uh, they wrote the check. Who was it? I don't know, he didn't say, I guess they just, they wanted to be held anonymous. Tristan, our prayers are answered. - Yeah. - You don't seem so happy. What's goin' on with you? No, no, I'm happy. I'm just havin' a little trouble wrappin' my head around it, I guess. I know. Oh, my gosh, this just came out of nowhere. - Yeah, it did. - I love you. I love you, too. That was convincing, I love you. I love you, too. It's good to see you smile. Can I call the doctor now? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go take a shower. Okay. All right. Hi, yes, this is Alexis Harris. I'd like to make an appointment for my daughter, Maggie. Yes, thank you. Yes, we can do tomorrow. Nine o'clock? Thank you.

Take him over there and plant him down there. All right. How long are you gonna let this man slow us down? - How do you mean that? - Like it sounds! You know they're on our trail from the river by now. That's right. Look, you're risking the whole bunch. Why don't you use your head and leave him here? He's dying anyway. You can leave anytime you want. I find it rather difficult with no one to talk to. Since you also are in the midst of a personal problem, well, it seems that, in fact, it appears at least we have that in common. I think we've enough for a first offense. You're a saint, I'm a sinner. Hardly that. Well, I'm right, you know. It's an ironical situation, isn't it? A mutinous young inspector leading us all to safety, if possible, and himself to execution at the same time. In that case, I think it's he and I who have the most in common. How do you feel? Did you eat? I've no taste in my mouth for food. You should've, you'll feel stronger. - Leave him alone. - He needs help. The more he gets, the more he's gonna slow us down. What're you doin'? I'm reading a book. Is that okay? Why don't you go read it in the bedroom? Why would you say that, Tristan? I wanna sit here and read it, I haven't seen you all day. You're readin' a book and I'm watchin' TV. How is that seein'? Can I just sit in the same room with you? I'm not bothering you. You are, I was enjoying my space until you came in. I'm not in your space. You've got half the couch. Will you please turn that down? If you don't like it, go read in the bedroom. It's okay, I like to read right here. Can you turn that down, please? I told you, you can go read in the bedroom. Why are you actin' like this? I told you, I wanted to be by myself. You've been by yourself all day. And I'd like to continue it. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me is I wanna be by myself. Why do you always wanna be around? Why, tell me why. Why don't you tell me why drinking has taken over your life? What is so bad here that you have to drink... Because it makes things tolerable. And I'm intolerable? I have done nothing to you. You have no reason to treat me this way. Maybe I don't want you around. You ever thought about that? Look at me like that, cry, I don't care. I just wanna be left alone. I was wondering about something. You're always wondering about something. Okay. So, go read your book somewhere else. You've said enough, I'm leavin'. Thomas, not very important. Thomas. Thomas. - Anything else? - Yes. When I woke up before, the first thing I thought was I don't want you to go on thinking that I killed somebody. I didn't. The marshal said you did. I know, it's my word against his. Army sends a patrol. Go on search every couple of days for Apaches. They get as close to here as four or five miles sometimes. There's a busted mirror over by that bar. Get a hold of it. Hold it up to the window, let the sun hit it. What? What? What? Who is Luke? Luke? He's the youth pastor at our church. You'd know that, if you came to church with me and Maggie. Bull. What are you implying, Tristan, that I'm lying to you? Who's Luke? Tristan, what're you doin', I'm not lyin' to you. Tristan, you're drunk, okay? We're not gonna have this conversation right now. - Yes, we are. - No, we're not. Yes, we're having this conversation now! Now, answer me! Now, answer me! Answer me! So help me god, you better answer me. Snap out of it! I have had it with you! I have had it! What has happened to you? I am so tired of having to deal with your drinking, and your sarcasm. I prayed for you to come back to me, and I feel like all I do is pray for you. What's wrong with you, Tristan? What's happened to you? So what do you wanna do, you just wanna give up? Oh, no, no, no. You're telling me that I'm giving up? It sounds like it. I miss you! I miss the man that I married. Well, I don't know how to come back! I am mentally exhausted, I'm done. But Tristan, I will not stay in this house, while you think that you have the liberty to push me around. While you have your little binge drinking, because you don't know how to deal with life, and you won't let me be a part of it. A divorce? No. Sometimes, yes, I would love it, but no, 'cause I'm not gonna walk away from you, but I will tell you this, Maggie will not see this. She will not be a part of this. You will not treat me this way because I do not deserve it! She will not learn that it is okay for a man to treat a woman like this. And more importantly, she is not gonna see her father acting like this. Right now, I don't trust you anymore. It's gone. And I think it's time for you to wake up and realize that if you don't start changing something now, we are gone. Because I will not put my daughter in danger. Yeah, that's how far you've let this come. Parts will be here On Wednesday, yeah. Yep. He will talk to you later. You have something for me? You're short, Mr. Harris. It's all there. You usually do good work, the best that I've had. Don't let it happen again. Wait a minute. This wasn't our agreement. You coming into my place of business. I don't want people knowing that I do business with people like you. And who's going to be looking, Mr. Harris? You run a mechanic shop. I drive an old car. It doesn't matter, it's the principle. You got something to say, Mr. Harris? I wouldn't. I've got a very important job coming up, that you just volunteered for. You be here tonight at eight o'clock. The kid will be here to pick you up. Oh, by the way. You tell your little daughter, she's welcome. So, how are you? I'm really worried about Tristan. Is he still drinking? Sometimes, I feel like all he does is stare at that whisky bottle, though, with that empty glass. Well, have you talked to him about that? No. You can't talk to Tristan about anything right now. Think he's just really overwhelmed with everything going on with Maggie. Well, she's doing better, though, right? I mean, the treatments are workin'. Yeah, yeah. Gosh, there's not a day that goes by that I'm not grateful for that, I just... I don't know, it's weird, it's like he blames himself. Like he feels guilty about it. The only thing I know to do, you just have to pray about it. Well, I am. I don't know, I just, I feel like it's one of those things that's gonna take time. Sometimes I feel like it's too late. Too late for what? I don't think any parent's prepared to have to deal with this, you know? Yeah, I'm sure. I just have one of those gut feelings. I don't know, like somethin' bad's getting ready to happen? You can't do that, I mean, worry and stress is like the worst thing you can do, it's not gonna help anything. I know. You know, every morning, I wake up, and I give Tristan over to God. And then I try to go about my day, and I try not to worry about him. And then I end up feeling like an awful wife later, because I don't know how to get him to talk to me. And then Maggie got sick. And then ever since then, I've just been walking on egg shells, just waiting for him... I don't know. I don't know what it is, but he acts like he's just gotta fight this thing on his own. Like it's him against the world and he doesn't even see me. It's like he looks straight through me. He doesn't know that I'm right here. But I don't even know if I'm a right fit for him. You're a great wife and I know that God put you and Tristan together for a reason. And whatever that reason is, I know it's a good one. I mean, the important thing is that Maggie's gonna be just fine. And Tristan's gonna come around, I mean, maybe it's a man thing or somethin' that he, he feels like he can't protect his family or somethin' like that, but everything's gonna be just fine. I promise. I hope so. It will be. I hope you're right. I don't understand why you think you have a choice. We always have a choice, Jacob. Somebody in your shoes? They don't have a choice. Look. Your daughter's recoverin', right? Yes. Okay, then do you want everything you've done up to this point to be for nothing? If you're tryin' to tell me somethin', Jacob, then just say it. Imagine Val puttin' her down permanently. Alongside your wife, I mean, I don't know if you just don't believe what Val is capable of, or not. I know who Val is and I know exactly what he's capable of. Roughin' people up and collecting money is one thing, but robbin' a church is something completely different, and I will not be a part of it. I can't be a part of it. Man, I know you did not wanna get caught up in all this, and I admire what you're tryin' to do, Tristan. Look, you do this one job, and I'm gonna get you out all this. How can you say that? We both know that's not a capability that you have. Things aren't always as they seem. You're gonna trust me on this one. And why should I trust you? I'm gonna pick you up here, Sunday mornin'. Tristan, just remember this.

That was the deal. But then you go and kidnap an innocent little girl. How am I supposed to trust you after that? If nobody's cooperating, what else am I supposed to do? I don't know, yell, or somethin'. But you don't kidnap an innocent little girl. That was not a part of the plan. I'm in charge here! You're not in charge of anything, and you need to get that through your thick skull. Because when Val gets here, you know exactly what he's gonna do to that little girl. Exactly. But I'm supposed to trust you, right? Right? Listen! No, you listen to me. I am tired of people gettin' hurt on my watch. It's time we play by my rules, now give me your pistol. Turn around. You did this to yourself. Let's go. Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you. Do you understand? Do you understand? Just get me outta here. You gotta do exactly what I say, understand? - Yes. - Let's go. Stop. Turn around. You know why you're here, right? I guess we have business to talk about, that you didn't want anybody else hearing? - Something like that. - Really? - I think you know, Jacob. - Know what? That you should probably give up being a mechanic? I know that you're an informant, Jacob. - I see. - I have no choice. You might wanna rethink that. We both know you're not a killer. And we both know that you're not gonna pull that trigger. Think about Maggie. This isn't you, Tristan. Tristan, I'm a cop. See? You're not a killer. You're just a father tryin' to save his daughter. If I untie you, can you show a badge? Turn around. I've been undercover for four years now. - But you're just a kid. - I'm 23, Tristan. But that's exactly how I got this job. See, no one suspects a kid to be undercover. Where does this leave me now? The thing you don't understand, is Val is connected all the way up the ladder. I need enough to through life at him, so he will give up these other people. Five, even 10 years, doesn't matter to these guys. My family cannot find out what I've done. You're not hearin' me. If you help me, I can get those charges dropped. And you and your family will walk away from this. How will they be protected? We will put all of y'all in Witness Protection. And that's a promise. So, what's the plan? You are late. No, do not makes excuses with me. It is your responsibility to make sure that he goes nowhere. You know the location, I will see you there tomorrow. Jesus, dude. Did you kill anybody? I didn't kill anybody. Just tune people up and collected, that's it. All right, so your daughter's surgery was a success. But you couldn't get out from under this Val Drexel guy? And he has you goin' around town doin' all these odd jobs, and in the midst of all this, you kidnap some kid? And this set you off, so you're gonna go kill Jacob, but you didn't... Look, I didn't know what I was gonna do. I didn't, I didn't know if I was gonna kill Jacob or not, I just knew that I could not be a part of this anymore. Couldn't do it anymore. But the only way that I could get out of it was to help Jacob take Val out. Wow. So, what happened next? Val, everything's under control. Everything is not all right for you, kid. Where am I? Alexis? Maggie? Maggie! Tristan. My son. Daddy? All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water, spilled out on the ground. It can't be gathered back up again. I don't understand. Where am I? Where you're supposed to be. I don't understand what's going on. You don't need to. But God just does not sweep life away. Instead, he provides us ways to bring us back. Until you've been separated from him. Tristan, my son. My work cannot be destroyed as I cannot be. Everyone will come to know me in this life or after. Just as you're being judged, everyone will be judged when this day comes for them. I knew you before you were. It's finished, Dad. It's time to come back. It's time. Don't be afraid. Be strong and courageous. Don't be terrified of this. For the Lord, your God walks by your side. And I've always had faith in you, even when you didn't in me. He will never leave you. I created you with a purpose, Tristan. He will never forsake you. Now... Come back, Daddy. Go and fulfill your purpose. Come back, Daddy. And do it with faith and love. As I created you to do. Because you are forgiven. Wait a minute. So, you're telling me you were clinically dead? Yes, I was. And during this time is when you claim you saw God during all this? I'm not claiming anything. But I know what I saw. And what I felt. Okay. All right, I'll bite. So, what did God tell you? That I wasn't fulfilling my purpose. - What's your purpose? - I don't know. Hm. What about this church you robbed? I think I remember reading something about that. "For if you forgive men their trespasses, "your heavenly father will also forgive you. "But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, "neither will your father forget your"... Dad? Yes, sweetheart? I overheard your conversation with Mom today. What've I told you about eavesdropping? I know, Dad, it's just that... Nevermind. No, come on, what is it? Well, I was just curious about Mr. Harris. What about him, what're you curious about? What's gonna happen to him? What do you mean? Did he go to heaven? Or hell? Well, I hope he went to heaven, sweetheart. What do you think will happen with him and God? That's between God and Mr. Harris. God knows his heart better than anybody, and it's up to him to judge his fate, it's not up to us. But won't God forgive him? Why do you ask that? Because God forgives all his children. Right? Of he does. So, everybody at the church will, too, right? I don't know about that, sweetheart. So, what do you think I should do? About what, Dad? About Mr. Harris. Do you think we should all forgive him? If God's forgiven Mr. Harris, why can't you? But do you think he deserves to be forgiven after everything that he's done? He done nothing to us, but everything to God. That's why God is the judge and not us. I can't believe we're still discussing this. A man robs a church and now we're thinking about forgiving him? I understand that, but I still feel we need to pray about it! What do we even need to pray about? What did Jesus do when the traitors were in his house? He kicked them out. I agree. That's not the way it went. They were not his children, they were lost and of the world! And I think we still need to remember here that Tristan is a child of God. Amen. I think he's just a man who's lost his way. How do we even know that? We don't! He's probably in hell. I mean... How can a child of God rob a church? I don't understand why we're still having this discussion! That's what we've been trying to get across to you. No, what I meant was, what are we really afraid of? To forgive him? Of what comes next! I don't follow you, Burgess. All right, let me paint you a picture. A man robs a church, the church forgives him. Every criminal around the country would be kicking in the doors of churches, and what would that have for public opinion? That we condone the criminals and their actions? Can't you see? We don't argue. We never argue. All the years that I've been on this council, we don't argue. Lucifer is trying to allow himself into this church because of the crimes of Mr. Harris's. Now, I am sorry, Pastor, but there's just no way that we could forgive Tristan. I admire that you've got this council together to make sure that we do it right, but there's no way. Does it matter what they think? You should only care what God thinks. Pray to him and he will answer you. This could be an opportunity for the church to show the world God's compassion for his children. And maybe help bring the lost to light. Sir? You okay? Pastor. Yes, I'm fine. So, what'd you guys think about the movie? - It was great. - It was scary. It was? What about when that guy popped out from behind the rock, was it a little scary? Enough. That was so much fun, wasn't it? Yep. Can we get some money to play video games? Yeah, I think that's all right. Here you go. - Sorry. - It's okay. How're you doin'? Let's take a seat for a moment. Ever since we talked yesterday, you've been on my heart. And what you shared, that was an amazing tale. But I don't really know what you need from me. I just need advice 'cause I don't know what to do. I don't have the answers this time. Are you sure that God hasn't already revealed it? If he has, I don't know what it is. Are you listening, truly listening? Always. Because I think he has spoken to you. It's like your daughter said. This is an amazing opportunity. But when I think of the word one, unity comes to mind. I believe, with all my heart, that if a group of people could stand together as one, we can change the world for the betterment of it all. And we tell ourselves we just need to pray about it, but sometimes before we do that, we have to ask ourselves, what exactly do we do when we pray? And right now, we're just talking. Just talking. But are we listening? 'Cause if we're not listening, we're not watching, and if we're not watching, how in the world can we see the opportunity that lies before us? Excuse me, Pastor, I think I speak for all of us when I say, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the opportunity that lies at hand, Mr. Burgess, I don't think you see the magnitude of the situation. And I don't think you see the gravity of this situation. If you don't get this right, there's gonna be a lot of people that walk out the front door. And Pastor, you have to look for a new church home. What's wrong, sweetheart? It's just, the more I think about it, I just wonder, what if they tell us to leave? Then we find a new home. - It's not that simple, Ruth. - Isn't it? No, it's not. Why not? See? It is that simple. What does your heart tell you? That we forgive this man. Well, maybe I'm just playing devil's advocate here, but they're not gonna understand why the church should forgive him. I don't care how smooth you lay it over to them. You have to remember, they're not meant to understand. They're meant to be led. So, lead them, show them the endgame. And it doesn't matter if they ask you to leave the church or not. Your home isn't the church. Your home is in the constant presence of God Almighty. And whatever God asks you to do, you do, period. And it sounds to me like God is asking you to lead these people and show the world what it's forgotten. I understand the hard road's never the easiest, or the most popular, and I understand that. But by the same token I am your pastor and I am your leader, and we will forgive this man, as God has forgiven the rest of us. And maybe in the meantime we'll even teach the world what it's forgotten, whether that be forgiveness or compassion. But until then, we will forgive this man, for every single child of God deserves to be forgiven. All right, well, time out. You're telling me the church just forgave you? The pastor did, but I went and talked to him, and I explained everything and we understand each other now. And the church is just okay with this stuff? You show up, you sing a song, you put money in the offering plate, or you take it. The pastor and I had a good conversation and that's all you need to know. All right, is that the end of it? Not quite. Elaborate. After the shootout, Val Drexel escaped, and no one could seem to find him. How did he do that? It's Val Drexel, I don't know. Hm, conspiracy. I see. What happened then? Lord. I'm not much of a prayer guy. I know I need to be. I'm gonna try my best. And Lord, you know my history and where I come from. And I didn't grow up with you, but I'm glad I've found you. Even though you've been there along the way, waiting for me. But Lord... I'm strugglin'. I'm tryin' so hard to follow you. But this man, this man has my family and I'm afraid. I'm afraid to lose them, knowin' I could've done somethin'. As much as I don't wanna sacrifice my faith, I don't wanna sacrifice my family for it. So, I need your help. I need your help. I don't wanna be violent anymore. I just need my family back. Please, God. Please, please. Please. I need my family back. With Val Drexel in the wind, Jacob did uphold his end of the bargain, and he put my family into Witness Protection. And you didn't join them? No. I couldn't, it... It was just more dangerous for my family if I was there, so I stayed somewhere separate, I thought that it would be safe. But I was wrong. This, this guy, Sergei, he came outta nowhere. He somehow figured out where my family was hiding in Witness Protection and he kidnapped 'em, in order to get me to come to him, and do whatever he needed me to do. So, what did he want with your family? Where's my wife and daughter? My apologies. Then tell me where they're at or not. Straight to business. I can respect that. Your respect isn't worth the bullet to kill it. You are an example man. You learn by example, do you not? Depends on what I'm trying to learn exactly. Exactly who you are dealing with. Wade. Come here. Tell me. How long have you worked with me? Seven years. Hm, seven years. That is a long time. Take Wade, for example. He worked for me for seven years, and in the end, was only worth making example of. What're you trying to tell me? That I want Val Drexel brought here, or else your wife and daughter will be my next examples. And how am I supposed to do that? Find a way. If you weren't my only option, you wouldn't be here. So, this guy, Sergei, he's holding your family hostage until you deliver Val to him? Yes. But I thought you just said no one could find him? He found me. Did you go see him? It's been very long time, Tristan. Yeah, it has. You are probably asking yourself, why this place? Isn't this where one comes to deal with their issues from the past? Why now, Tristan? Why you find me now? I need your help. Interesting. What in the world could you possibly need with this old, broken down Russian? So, did you take Val to Sergei? No. But what about your family? Look, the thing you need to understand about Val is why he does what he does. Okay. Tell me. It was about 10 years ago in Minsk, Belarus. Val Drexel was actually an undercover cop, okay? And he was investigating Sergei's crime family. Sergei didn't know this, but one day, Val Drexel's little daughter gets killed, and it was Sergei that did it, but he didn't know that this little girl was Val Drexel's daughter, but even still, he was in enough trouble, so he had to flee the country. When he fled the country Val Drexel followed him, came here. But his undercover stuff was still intact and he had to do whatever he had to do to get closer to Sergei. So, that's why Val had to keep this mobster cover. But yet, he somehow wound up on Jacob's radar anyway. Exactly. So, Val used you. No. We used each other. I don't know. This all seems so incriminating if I publish it. Look, look, look, don't worry about my immunity. I've got that taken care of. What do you want me to do with this story? I don't know, I'm not the writer. I just wanna know why I'm being told about this. Look, the thing is, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But fighting for my family will never be one of them. And I've hurt a lot of people along the way, just to make sure that my daughter had a shot at life. And the things that I've done, I will have to pay for 'em. And I'll have to live with them. And I don't know God's plan. And I don't pretend to. I just need you to write this story... And let God do his work. That's all I got, thanks for the coffee. Wait!
