"Padre Pio" San Giovanni Rotondo 22.09.1968 after midnight I'm afraid he has to be hospitalized. That's impossible. Tomorrow he must celebrate mass. Let's let him rest. Please... don't tell anyone what you've seen here. Your Excellency. What brings you here? I want to see him. -That's impossible... He's very ill. -What about all these people? What are they waiting for? These are prayer groups. It's a special day for them. -Why? It was 50 years ago today he received the stigmata. In that case, I'll personally give him my best wishes. Don't you have a heart? Can't you see he's upset? Why are you tormenting him? Who's out there? Nobody, father. Don't lie to me... Let him in. He wants to see you. Leave us alone. Who sent you here? -Nobody sent me. I'm here for personal reasons. So then I'm not compelled to answer... But you will. Because you're too sure of your saintliness. I'm just a poor friar. But you have all those fanatics following you to celebrate you. There's nothing to celebrate, you know? I'm dying. So, the moment has come to tell the truth. What do you want to know? Everything that you've kept hidden. You've persecuted me for 50 years, and you still haven't had enough? 50 years of medieval ways, that's what you've given us. You've always exploited the people's faith, you encouraged fanaticism, and superstition... And you, the saint, the healer. The Church doesn't need people like you. But I need the Church. I don't want to die like this, rejected! So then tell me the truth. Who are you... Francesco Forgione? Also known as Padre Pio from Pietrelcina? Tell me who you are. I don't know. I'm a mystery even to myself, you know? What do You want from me? I don't understand. Why won't You speak to me? Say something... What are you doing? I'm scared! Help me! Where are You when I need You? I'm afraid! I felt I was being tested and left alone, but I knew that when I was before him, nothing could hurt me. He was my... food. And I trusted in Him, even when I was in despair. Very touching. But I'm not here to hear about a child's tribulations. But you're wrong, because everything started that day. I understood that if I implored Him with all my heart He would listen to me. San Pellegrino... since you're a saint that can work miracles, please help me. This poor child of mine. San Pellegrino... please help me, because my son is ill. Will you? Don't you want to help me? San Pellegrino. Don't you want to help me? Then I'll leave him here. Very good, San Pellegrino, you did the right thing. It's a miracle! San Pellegrino has performed a miracle! Francesco... what have you done? Come on, let's go now. What are you telling me? My life... You want me to believe that you've had these powers since childhood? I've never had any power at all, I've always been just a simple witness of Our Lord's miracles. Hey, little fella. What's the matter? You scared of me? You're the first one who's ever been scared of me. Where's your mother? She went out to the fields, but she's coming back. What's your name? -Francesco. What's yours? I'm Brother Camillo. Who are they? This is Saint Joseph, this is Saint Francis. And this is Saint Michael the Archangel. -Wait! Who are they? This one, pierced by arrows, is Saint Sebastian. And this one... is Saint Anthony from Padova. -I didn't know them. -Oh, no? Wait. You know these, don't you? Sure, Jesus and the Holy Mother. I always see them. What, you see Jesus and the Holy Mother? What do you say to each other? Many things... Why, don't you ever see them? Actually, I've never had such luck. I don't believe you, you're only saying so because you're humble. Since you're friends with them, next time you see them, tell them to get in touch with me. Don't worry, I'll tell them about you. Lord, please bless this blood In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I want to become a friar, like Brother Camillo. Francesco... you know that in order to become a friar you have to study? And in order to study, you need lots of money. If Francesco wants to become a friar, we'll find the money. And how? You could sell the cow. No... I won't sell the cow! What kind of a father are you? You love an animal more than your own son?! If the Lord wants my son to become a friar, I'll find a way for him to study. But I won't sell the cow. The cow... no! Dad, don't leave! Ot's my fault if you have to go far away! Let's go, my friend. Papa! Please don't go! Those poor parents of mine. How many sacrifices they made, so that I could study. "You are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in the Lord" Peace and all good. Hey.. kid! You've finally come. Come along. I'll introduce you to the novitiates master. In Nomine Patris, et Filiis et Spiritus Sancti... amen. Father, please take some rest. No... Tell me, kid, life as novitiate was very hard, eh? Yes, father... Yes. They make it so to mortify the youngsters' pride. You know what's Saint Francis' greatest miracle? After 700 years, there are still a few young men who want to become friars. May the Lord make you a new man. Amen. -Wit these new clothes, may the Lord teach you justice and the holiness of truth. Amen. Please Lord, put the hood of salvation on his head, so that he will defeat the devil's temptation. Amen. May the Lord fasten this belt of purity around your waist, and may He free you from the poison of lust, so that the virtues of restraint and chastity stay within you. Amen. Accept the light of Christ as proof of your immortality, So that after your death, you will live on within God. Risen from the dead, Christ will illuminate you. Amen. -From this moment on, you bid farewell to the material world. And your name will be Brother Pio from Pietrelcina. Amen. Giovanni, is that you? Giovanni. The light went out, like many other times. It was the Lord who wanted to shake me and beat me, as one does with meat. So that my spirit would be purified. How do you know it was not the devil, who made you become what you are? It's true, the devil often deceives us. And I've always been afraid of him. So afraid. I can't believe it. This is the second thermometer that he's burst. Let's see if he bursts this one. It's for horses. Tell me, doctor. -He has pneumonia. Is it so serious? Yes, unfortunately. His temperature is 45 degrees! I've never seen this before! -What should we do, doctor? He has a family. Let's send him back home. What is it, Pio? I... I don't want to go. I don't want to die. Before I become a priest. Francesco! Francesco... how are you? Francesco... Mother. What happened? They gave me some time to rest. Why, are you ill? -No, no. I'm fine now. This is Father Agostino, my confessor. -Peace and all good. -Good morning. Pio, I'm wondering if you were really ill in the first place. No, no. It's just the air of my village. It's the air of my village. May Jesus be praised, Francesco. -May He always be... Peppino, my name's not Francesco! You have to call me Padre Pio! As you prefer, Francesco... Had do you want? -Our fields. They're infested by bugs! What can I do about it? -You could bless the fields. Send them away! If you don't send them away, we're done for! Peppino, I'm not a miracle worker, you know?! But you know Someone up there, or don't you? Do it for our children... How will we feed them? Alright, let's go. Mater purissima. Miserere nobis. Mater divinae gratiae. Miserere nobis. Mater purissima. Miserere nobis. But... guys, you have to pray with me! And do it loud. Otherwise the bugs won't hear you! Let's start again. Mater divinae gratiae. Miserere nobis. Mater purissima. Miserere nobis. Mater divinae gratiae. Miserere nobis. Mater purissima. Miserere nobis. Mater castissima. Miserere nobis. Francesco... Francesco! They're dying! They're all dying, Francesco! Holy Mother, you're... This guy's a demon! Hey! Hey! What did I do? Why? -You cursed the Holy Mother! Do it again and I'll give you a lesson. Is that clear? Let's pray. Mater divinae gratiae. Miserere nobis. Mater purissima. Miserere nobis. Quickly, father. If my husband discovers I'm here, he'll kill us. Don't worry. Accipe sal sapientiae propritiatio sit tibi in vitam aeternam. Amen. No, no.. I have to do it again. I hadn't blessed the salt, wait. Exorcizo te creatura salis in nomine Patris omnipotentis et virtute Spiritus Sancti. Accipe sal sapientiae propritiatio sit tibi in vitam aeternam. Amen. -Amen. What's with him? What's happening? He's not breathing! -What do you mean, not breathing? -Mom! Mother! -How come he's not breathing?! -My poor son! Don't cry! -Holy Mothers! He isn't breathing! My poor son! Oh my God! -Holy Mother! Uncle Tore! Uncle Tore! What is it? -I killed him! Uncle Tore, I killed him! -Who did you kill?! I killed Pasquale's son, I drowned him with the salt! Santa Madonna! Pio, the next time you play a trick on me, I swear I'm gonna kill you! My Jesus Christ be praised. Jesus, what kind of a priest am I? Please, tell me. What kind of a priest am I? I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready for what you have in mind. Pio, what's wrong? -I don't know. -Oh my God! Go Maria, go! But these, these are the signs of Our Lord. This is too much for me. Uncle Tore, it's too much! I'm ashamed, Uncle Tore. Why? Why me? Why me, of all people?! I need Jesus to help me. I want to die, I'm willing to die suffering. But I must hide myself! Let's pray son, let's pray. They're healing, Uncle Tore. How do you feel? A bit better. -May the Lord be praised. Francesco... Francesco... Francesco... Francesco... Jesus would like you a lot more, if you'd stop being a priest. Time is precious, don't waste it. Spend it praying for your health, because you're in danger. Francesco! Time is precious. Don't waste it. Time is precious. Don't waste it. If you keep on being a priest... -Go away! You must know that your life... will be hell! -Go away! Jesus and Mary! Francesco.. Francesco! Francesco, what happened? Francesco! How do you feel? I'm fine, mother. Don't worry. Bring me a glass of water. Yes... alright. Pio. I have two pieces of news for you. I could have written, but... I preferred coming to see you. -What kind of news? One is bad and the other is good. Which one first? -The good one. You made it. We received your dispensation. You can confess now. Thank you, Agostino. Don't thank me, now I have to give you the bad one. You must come back with me. Why? There was a meeting at the Foggia court, they pressed Father Benedetto, and... you must come back immediately, or they will request your secularization. You will not be a priest anymore. I cannot leave from here. But your health is fine now, why don't you want to come back? It's not me. Do you realize what you're saying? Temptations are terrible, Agostino. Everything's a sin, Agostino. Everything's a sin. I've always defended you, but now I can't anymore. Remember you took a vow of obedience. Come on, let's get on this carriage. -Father Agostino! If you're here to take our beloved saint, it's better that you go away. Who told them? Maybe it was my guardian angel. How dare you be disrespectful to Father Agostino? Apologize immediately! -We'll apologize, but you won't leave. Alright, alright... I won't take him away. Pio. I'll never come back here. I'm fond of you, but I won't be beaten for you. Agostino. When Father Benedetto gets angry, and I'm sure he will.. Give him this letter. And please, read it before giving it to him, alright? Peace and all good. Go away now, go. I always defended him against everyone, and this is how he pays me back! He's making me look like a fool before my superiors. Let's wait a few more days, I'm sure he'll change his mind. -No! He must come back immediately! If he doesn't, he'll be expelled form the order! Why are you so hard on him? Maybe he's right. About what? -Well, he says that... that you're advised by Satan himself! That' what he says?! After all I've done for him! I'll have him expelled! Please take this. This is a letter from him. It contains the answers to those difficult moral questions you've had regarding those four people. How does he know about it?! Write immediately to Padre Pio, and tell him... that I authorize him to stay in Pietrelcina. And you? What do you want to be when you grow up? When I grow up, I want to steal a rifle. So why not steal a cannon? I want a rifle to shoot the krauts. I want to kill them all. Austrians, Germans... Who put this nonsense into your head? Nobody. I just want to fight. Did you come here to study the catechism or go to war? We want to go to war just like the grown-ups! You too? Cross yourselves in the name of the Father, the Son... cross yourselves! Eternal Father, we offer you the blood, the passion and the death of Jesus. Are you going to take up a rifle like everyone else? Go home, now. Come on, Forgione, undress. The Lieutenant must examine you. Get a move on! Are you still dressed?! Come with me. Come along with me. He doesn't want to undress. What's up, Forgione? Are you going to undress, or do you want us to force you? Without my robe I would feel naked. We want you to be naked, otherwise how will we examine you? Does he have another robe underneath? I bet he wears two pairs of underwear, too! I was afraid... Afraid of the war... I was not a good Christian. I wasn't ready yet to confront death. Nonsense! Stop talking nonsense! The war was terrible for everyone, but not for you. I know you were sent home. We must send him back home immediately. With these lungs, he'll infect the whole division. I doubt he'll even make it home. -Forgione. You're going back home. Happy? Stop. Pio. Agostino. How are you? How did you know I was coming back? I have my divine sources, too. And my earthly orders. What do you mean? -We must leave immediately. Where do we go? -To Foggia. To Foggia? But I just got back. Let me at least see my mother. No, there's no time. You must come with me. I've received peremptory orders. Come on... Let's go, or we'll miss our train. Pio, we must go! If you don't get on that train, you'll be expelled from the order. Come on, let's go. What's going on? Please, let me pass. -What's wrong with this guy? Father, since this Padre Pio arrived, we can't sleep anymore! If you're scared, go back to your cell, alright? Please, please, back to your cells. Go now, go. Pio?! Pio, answer. It's me, Agostino... Pio! Pio, how do you feel? Upside down. What about last night? What did he want? There was a woman. She was dying. And he kept saying: "Save her! Let me see what you can do!" I don't know who that woman was, Agostino, but... I know her name. Raffaellina Cerase. But I know her! I've heard her confession many times! Then, Agostino. take me to her, immediately. Alright, Pio. Raffaellina? Uh? Padre Pio! I knew you would come. Tonight you were beside me. You were praying for me.. and you saved me. Don't worry, alright? We'll pray together. -But I don't want to be saved. I want to meet again the people I love. -No, no... You must be saved. -No... -For all the people who love you. No, don't insist, Father. Let me die. You'll see what I'll be able to do from heaven. And now... please bless me, Father. Please bless me. The rest... doesn't matter. Ego te absolvo. God, God, God, God... You're the God of life. Jesus, my Jesus. You told me that whatever I ask in your name, you'll grant me. Now I'm asking. Let her live, Jesus. Let her live, let her live! Let it be, Pio. She's dead. I should have saved her! -Reconcile yourself. Raffaellina was very ill. And anyway... And she was prepared to die. -But I'm not prepared! Jesus.. God. God... You raised Lazarus from the dead. Let her live. Let her live, Jesus. -Stop it! Don't tempt God! Learn the sacred humility of people who suffer and die. From now on, this will be... your battlefield. I'm a conceited and proud man. But why? Why does he always win? See? See? See? You believe someone who says he defeated death! But I am the real master of death! Go away! Get away from me! You tried to defy me, but you failed! You and him... you're both failures! Give up being a priest, I warned you! You're a failure! -Go away... GET AWAY FROM ME! Father... father, what's the matter? I can't breathe. I know a place... Where you might feel better. It's a small friary on a hill, not so far away from here. If Father Agostino agrees, I could take you there. The air is good there. What's the name of this place? San Giovanni Rotondo. I'm tired, kid. Where's this blessed place? We're almost there. We've been walking for three days. There it is. Father... you seem stunned, father. I'll never leave this place. I'll never leave. 100 lire! Buy Padre Pio! Only 100 lire! It's Padre Pio, 100 lire! Buy Padre Pio, 100 lire! Padre Pio, 100 lire! Padre Pio! 100 lire for the original Padre Pio! It's the original Padre Pio! Did you hear how much I'm worth? A hundred lire. After all, I'm lucky. Jesus was sold... while I'm being purchased. Why did you never leave this place? They offered you many other seats. I made a promise. Or did you want to make a stronghold out of this place, with people ready to buy pieces of your sanctity! If you only saw the poverty I've seen, when I came here. What are you doing out with this bad weather! We're not afraid of a little bit of rain, Father. Father, did you remember to pray for my mother? Oh, don't worry, she'll live longer than both of us. And my brother in the war? - I'm sure he already went AWOL. He'll be back. He'll be back, don't worry. Pray now, pray. Carmela. How do you know my name? -I know many things about you. Your sacrifices in order to have your children study. Your house is freezing. The bread that is lacking. But don't worry, everything will work out in the end. In the meantime, you have to dress warmly. Will you put a shawl on, yes or no? But I don't have a shawl. You don't have one? Wait just a minute. Here. Buy a shawl for your shoulders. Pio! Pio! ... Pio! What's the matter? -Look at this! -What is it? What's wrong? Somebody stole Our Lady's jewels! -No! Oh, Mother... Now, I ask myself. Who could have done something like this? Was it you? -No. Not this time. -Not this time, alright. So tell me, who do you think stole them? What do I know?! Some poor devil. He probably came here and told her: "What do you do with all this gold?! Give it to me, so I can buy some food for my children!" And the Holy Mother gave it to him. So, for you, that's what happened?! Knowing the Holy Mother, I'd say so. Go, go, go! -Anyway, you shouldn't be there screaming at the altar! Do me a favor. Get lost! -Two earrings and a bracelet! There was a necklace, too! -It was imitation gold! Go away, go! We must be patient. Padre Pio. -Peace all and good. -Come in. Come here, kids. Look what I brought for you. We always knew you were a good man. How can we repay you? We're poor, we don't have anting. Let's give some to your sister too. And what will you eat? Don't worry about me. We friars are helped by Providence. Be good, kids. Otherwise, you see this? God bless you. Take care. Lord... You know how much I love you. You know everything. I'd like to take the world's suffering on my shoulders... like you did, but you knew how to do it. While I don't. Jesus. Do you... Do you see all this suffering, all this poverty? I can't stand all this suffering all by myself. Tell me what to do. Please, tell me. Help me. Pio... Pio.. Is something wrong? Hey, Pio. Nicola, please, go and prepare some hot broth for Pio... Go, go! Come here, Pio. Come. Lean on me, come on. Lay down on your bed, Pio. Don't worry, come here. Here, lay down. Here. We're alone now, aren't we? Can you tell me what happened? -I don't know. I don't know, Paolino. I can't explain. I heard some voices. The suffering on Mount Calvary. Paolino! Paolino, He was there! He was there, and I felt that.. that He was dying for me. What's wrong, Pio? What's wrong? Pio? A spear. A spear pierced me. There was fire and light, Paolino. Fire and light. Pio, these are signs of the Lord. They keep on bleeding, Pio. I must call a doctor. No, no, no... -Do you want to bleed to death?! No, Paolino! Don't call anybody. The Lord will heal me. We just have to... pray. By now, he's the talk of the town. Everybody's asking me about him, they want to know! Alright, but I promised him not to say anything. We can't deny it! You must persuade him to let the doctor examine him. Do they often bleed? Yes, constantly. The more I cover them, the more they bleed. What about the pain? It never stops, day and night. But it's not the pain, It's the shame. That's the worst thing. Tell us, professor. Here it is. It's all in here. Please, go on. "We must exclude that the etiology of Padre Pio's injuries is of natural origin. The cause is to be found, without fear of mistake of error in the supernatural. This event is to be considered as a phenomenon that cannot be explained with only human science." The newspapers are writing about this miracle-working saint in San Giovanni Rotondo. Must we continue tolerating this kind of fanaticism? I've recently been to San Giovanni Rotondo, and I can assure you that Padre Pio is an honest and humble friar. And he's the first to feel sorry for these unpleasant events, But you told me more than that. You said that the signs in his hands are of supernatural origin. Yes, Father Gemelli. Professor Romanelli told me so, This assertion is not based on any scientific principle, The Church is changing, we must deal with science. The new century forces us to no longer support forms of obscurantism. Please remember that the Church is an institution, but also a prophecy, and a bearer of charisma. What kind of charisma are you talking about? In hospital, I cured dozens of women who thought they saw the Virgin Mary. Every year, there are dozens of people who report having stigmata. The world is full of people who believe in wizards, shamans or sorcerers. It is us who create the need for saints. So let's strip the altars, then. Let's abolish holidays, let's eliminate the litanies. With all this positivism, what will remain of the Church? I have ordered that from now on, nobody will be allowed to see Padre Pio's stigmata without an explicit authorization of the Holy Office. -We must be cautious. And strict. And if you'll authorize me, Your Holiness, I'll personally examine Padre Pio. Father Gemelli. If you had informed us about your arrival, I would have sent someone to receive you. Don't worry about it. Where is this Padre Pio? I want to examine his stigmata. Well, I'm sorry father, but... you don't have an authorization from the Holy Office, I can't allow you to see him. Do you realize who you're talking to? Sure, father, I know, but without an authorization... The Pope himself sent me here. Well, with all due respect, sir, show his authorization, and... Isn't my word enough? Anyway, Father, if you want to stay here, be our guest! You can also meet Padre Pio, if you want. But without an authorization, I can't accept your request. This is Father Gemelli. What have you come for? You wanted to see the freak show? I'm sorry, today the circus is closed. I'm here on behalf of the Pope. No. You're here because you think you know everything. What do you want to see? In your mind, you have already judged and condemned me. Go your own way, and leave me in peace. Leave me in peace. Pio, this is a copy of the report that Father Gemelli delivered to the Pope. "Unsound of mind"? "A psychopath" "A self-injurer" He treated me like a criminal... Before the Pope. Don't despair, Pio. We know how things really went, don't we? It's not their fault. It's the devil, he knows how to confuse wise minds. Listen to me. Real pain. Real pain is caused by the people we love. We can forgive, though. And prayer is the key to forgiveness. Pray. But pray without sadness. Don't bore the Lord! Our God is the Lord of joy! You know what I mean? Pray... Pray with a smile. From tomorrow, you'll meet at Maria Pyle's place. You still have a home, don't you? I sold everything but my home. -Good, hold on to it. It'll become your little church, alright? Pray and smile. Alright? Now go... In nomine Patris et Filiis et Spiritus Sancti... go... Goodbye. Father. This is my daughter, Cleonice. My mother says I have to thank you, because thanks to your prayers I graduated and became a teacher. Does your mother say so? But it's not me you have to thank, it's her. She's the one who made sacrifices to allow you to study. Let me see the letter. The appointment, to go teach in Benevento. You won't go, you'll stay here. What are you saying?! It's my job! You're a conceited and arrogant girl. You'll stay here. Thank you. Leave her alone. Don't rape her. She's an innocent creature... An innocent creature. Cleonice. I was waiting for you. The girl who took my place in Benevento has been raped. She's in hospital now. God will help her, and heal her. You saved me. How did you know? Sometimes, God allows me to read his notebook. And what did He write about me? That you'll watch over my injuries, and nobody, nobody will dare to hurt you. Hey, Filomena. How are you? Can I do something for you? I've come here to report something terrible... Really terrible. -Oh, really? What's happened? It's about Padre Pio. -Oh, Padre Pio. Lately, he's the talk of the town. What has he done this time? He's having an affair. An affair? Who is she? She's a young girl. Her name is Cleonice. Cleonice Morcaldi. A young girl. And what does she look like? Filomena... What does she look like? Is she beautiful like you? Oh, Filomena. This is the hand of the Lord... Alright, we can go. Hold on, hold on. You in the back, wait here. What's this crowd? What is it? We heard that they want to transfer you. Who told you this nonsense? They say that your prodigies are not supernatural at all. Yeah, sure. Then I self injured myself. It's from the Manfredonia Curia. It says that the bishop filed a complaint against you. What a waste. All this paper to light my stake. Anyway... What can they do to me? I've already been crucified. Yes, but... Christ wasn't accused of having an affair. Or arranging orgies. Manfredonia's bishop is an unworthy priest, a scumbag. He steals the Curia's money. He's also a whore monger. Who are you? Who are you to speak like that of a Church's bishop? Who are you? You're a lecher, a gambler, an inveterate sinner! Who are you?! Learn humility! Humility is the most important thing! Be thankful that my hands are injured, otherwise I would have crushed your face! Go away. You can't fight Satan with Satan... GO AWAY! Go away... go! What's happening to me? What do you want?! What do you want from me? What do you want from me, priest? What do you want?! Get out of my life, get out. Who do you think you are? Go away! Go away! What's up, you skunk? It was a long night, wasn't it? And now, what do you want from me? I want to confess. You want to confess? There's no need, you know. You already told me your sins, this night. Do you remember? You must help me, Father. I.. I want to change my life. I want to find... That peace that I have always looked for. And you came to ask me? I haven't had any peace of mind since the day I was born! You're absolved. Come here! To redeem a weak soul... is like saving a sapling that is withering. You must transplant it, let it breathe. Give it water, and light. And let it live in the forest of Our Lord. Bring me the wheelchair, boy. -Yes. You see? You become like a child all over again. But you're not a child. You're too cunning. You told me all these stories, to hide the only thing I want to know. Where are your stigmata? You don't have them anymore. I have unmasked you. It was a hoax! -You're wrong. He healed me. Then why do you keep your hands hidden? Go to your people and tell them that the friar with the stigmata is nothing but a swindler! Confess to them that it was all make-believe! I don't understand what He wants from me. I only know that when He gave them to me, He told me that He would take them away after 50 years. And now's the moment. He doesn't need me anymore. Then tell the truth. Show them to everyone. I will. But now, please. Come to celebrate mass with me. In nomine Patris, et Filiis et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Pater noster, qui es in coelis, sacntificetur nomen tuum, adveniat regnum tuum... Father, you've made a mistake. You should recite the canon of consecration first. In nomine Patris, et Filiis et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Ite missa est... Father, don't leave me alone. Don't leave me alone. Don't go yet. Stay here. I want to confess. You can't refuse to confess a dying man. Don't leave. I'll tell you everything. End of part one dedicated to Alberto Soffientini Padre Pio Part 2 "Padre Pio" San Giovanni Rotondo, 22.09.1968 Your Excellency, Padre Pio wishes to see you. Leave me alone with him. Father, I can't. I received an order... Kid, who's giving orders here? There are things that I can only say to him. After what I've seen, it's no longer necessary. But it's necessary for me. I want to confess my sins. I want you to hear my confession. Well... since the evidence of your sanctity is gone, you must at least tell me why. Tell me! -Don't you understand? I'm finished. Then tell me the truth. Before it's too late. Was Father Gemelli right? Father Gemelli? He said that I was a hysteric. He was a great doctor... while I was just a poor friar. That condemnation plagued me for all my life. But it's right. The Church must be... ...careful. Anyway, it wasn't Father Gemelli's fault. It was... the devil's fault. I know you don't like to talk about it, but you must believe me. He exists. And he is... cunning. Very cunning. Father. So you still don't get it. I am man and darkness. And you're an idiot! -Go away! Let's see if your faith will comfort you this time... I'm going to take away from you the one you love the most. He has an inflamed hernia, we must take him to Foggia for an operation! He won't even go to bed. Pio... Did you hear the doctor? You must go to Foggia! I won't move from here. Father, this is serious. Let's go to Foggia, to my surgery. I want to be cured here. Bring your equipment here. I won't move from here. Alright, I'll see what I can do. -Yes doctor, we'll help any way we can. Please be patient. Pio... please, would you tell me what's happened? We pay for everything, Paolino. Good and bad... We pay for everything. Come in, Father. We're ready. You scoundrel... You're looking forward to butchering me like a lamb, right? Oh come on, the sooner we operate on you, the better you'll be. I warn you, doctor, I don't want to be chloroformed. No, I can't operate without anesthesia. Pio, what are you saying? -No, Paolino. Do you know what he wants to do? He wants to put me to sleep, just to look at my stigmata. Isn't it so? Yes... I thought about it. -There we are. Don't even think about it. I received the order not to show them to anyone, right? Anyway, don't worry about the pain. I'm used to it. Paolino... do me a favor, put a couple of candles by my side. If he does make a mistake, it'll all be ready, at least. Hello, Francesco. Mom! Mom... -They told me you weren't well... so I came to see you. What are you doing, mother?! Everyone kisses your hands, why can't I? But who's ever heard of a mother who kisses her son's hands! I'm not kissing them for me, but for your brother, and your father! Come on, stop it, enough! -For your uncle and aunt.. they asked me to! -Get up! That's enough. Get up! What's wrong, mother... what's wrong? Sit down... sit down.. It's nothing, don't worry, it's nothing. I'm tired because of the trip, it gave me a headache. But now that I've seen you, I can go back to Pietrelcina. No, no... now you'll stay here, with me. We'll spend Christmas together, alright? Do you want me to sleep here, with the friars? Watch the step. This is my mother.. this is Maria Pyle. She has a room all ready for you. Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom! Mom! Pio... Where do you think you're going in this rain?! Alright... you should at least cover yourself. Francesco. How do you feel, mother? I'm going to... get some rest. Don't leave me, mother. What will I do without you? Don't cry, Francesco. He's been there for three days now. He doesn't eat or sleep. -Maybe... What if I try talking to him? -It'd be useless. He didn't even recite mass. Dad, there's nothing left to do here. It's time you went back home. What about you? What will you do, son? I'll wait, dad... I'll wait. When In the presence of Christ's body, you shouldn't be checking your watch. They told me about it, but I refused to believe them. Three hours. Three hours to celebrate mass. No, no. You should conform to the standard used by all priests. 30-35 minutes is usually enough. The mass is the Passion of Christ. Do you want to set a time limit for the Passion? These are the orders. From today on, by decree of the Holy Office, you're forbidden to celebrate mass in public. The women will be forbidden from staying in the church to pray, and the doors to the cloister will remain shut. Furthermore, you're forbidden to confess anyone... Both men and women. What can I do, then? That's all I know how to do. Who'll take care of those poor people's souls? You, Father Paolino, are relieved from your assignment. And you'll be transferred to another convent. Father Raffaele will be the new superior. Why are you blaming him? Punish me... not an innocent man! Father Raffaele, I'm confident that you'll enforce the observation of these orders. Easy, Paolino, easy. I brought you a lot of trouble, didn't I? -No, what are you saying, Pio? On the contrary. When I'm finally "there", I'll proudly say: "My friend is a saint!" Oh, come off it! -Sure, and they let me in! Don't talk nonsense! Pio... -Yes? When you're in heaven. Please remember me. Alright.. it's a deal. Off with you now, don't make me cry. Paolino... Go. My dearest, beloved girls. It's really painful to see you out here, exposed to the cold. Your love moves me. And I love you. All of you. Pray. Always keep praying... and don't disband your groups. I will always be your shepherd. Dearest and revered Father. You asked me why I'm always wandering round the convent. I'm doing it to feel close to you. If my father was in jail, I would spend my days walking round his prison. Father.. I stared for a long time at the small window of your cell, hoping to see you. I ask myself if needing you could be considered a sin. While you are praying in the choir, I'm in the attic, from where I can see the convent. I'm keeping you company. Praying for you. My beloved girl, your loyalty is a great comfort to me. Just like you, I've often asked myself if writing to you... is a sin. I asked the Lord to give me an answer. At this point, he's forbidden to do anything. He lives like a convict. Nobody's going to church anymore, and the prayer groups are slowly disbanding. They've ruined everything. Thank you. Tell me the truth... You've fallen in love with him? Yes. But it's not the way you think. Do you think that a man like me can't understand? I love him too. I love him more than I love myself. My life... didn't have any meaning before i met him. Neither did mine. But what will I do, if I can't see him anymore? -Don't worry. I've been digging up some old documents. One way or the other, we'll get him back. Now I have to go. Take care of yourself. Do you know what this is? Read... read the title. "The Antichrists of Christ's Church" And you know who wrote it? Your friend Brunatto. He's a blackmailer, and you must stop him! Find a way, you must absolutely stop him! Even the Holy Father is very upset. Now that we're about to sign the agreement with the Italian state, a scandal is the last thing we need. Write to him, do whatever you want, but you must stop him. It pains me to And that's an order! What do you want? Good morning, Father. I need to see Padre Pio. For you, that is absolutely forbidden. But I must talk to him! Can't you see you've ruined him? In Rome, they think he's the one behind this story. -It's not true! He hasn't done anything! Wait! I must talk to him! Father! Father, can you hear me?! I know that you can hear me. I know that you're mad at me! But I didn't have any choice! This is the only way to get Rome to set you free! I can't obey you... I can't! Brother Pio, look who's here. Pio! Agostino. Agostino. It's been a long time, a long time. Let's sit down, I must talk to you. -Alright. This way. Gaetano, would you mind if we continue later? Sit down, Father Raffaele. Do you remember when I came to Pietrelcina to bring you two bits of news, a good one and a bad one? -Of course I remember. Let's start with the bad one. Don't worry, I'm used to it. No, Pio... This time there's just one, and it's some wonderful news. You're free. Your detention is over. But please, let's not have it start all over, agreed? That doesn't depend on me. 10.07.1940 The moment of truth is about to come. The crowds surround the Duce for the latest announcement. Fighters... (Benito Mussolini's voice) of ground, sea and air. Blackshirts of the Revolution and of the Legions. Men and women of Italy, of the Empire and the Kingdom of Albania! Now listen to the declaration of war that has already been delivered to ambassadors of Britain and France. He's alive, he's alive! He told me that he saw you, he saw a friar looking just like you, that saved him from a grenade that exploded close to him. Thank you! Cleonice, do me a favor... tell Nina to get up. I can't stand here all day, I'm very busy. I must go... Padre Pio. What happened to these boys? Look into your pocket, you may find another picture. Another picture? -Look into your pocket. I'm sorry, none of them survived. Father... help me. -Don't worry, everything will be okay. Thank you... Thank you. What about you? What's wrong? -I want to confess my sins. Don't worry, your soul is already healed. And soon, your body will be healed too. You won't be sent to the front. Father! -Easy, easy. Help me, Father! Back off! My husband's ship, it has been sunk. Don't worry, you'll hear from him soon. -Thank you... Father, it's a miracle! -What happened?! In Foggia, a bomb hit a five story building! And?! -It didn't explode! A lot of people started to pray in front of your picture! No big deal, then. All's well that ends well, isn't it? I should get a picture of this Padre Pio guy for myself! Next... Next! -Father, there's no one. Where did they go? I sent them home. -Why?! Because you're tired. You've been in there for 10 hours. They want me to take the cross from off of their backs. So I have to bear it in their place. Yes, but you can't carry all the suffering of this world. Well, not all of it. Only what I deserve. Come with me. -Where? -Outside. But it's dark. -No, there's the moonlight. I want to show you something. Look at the sky. Look at it, Cleonice. Your name is written among the stars. Who wrote it there? The Astronomer. You're making fun of me. He's right there, you see? Look... I'll introduce you to Him. What are you talking about? The hospital! You can't always ask for miracles. We built a big hospital, after the war, and there will be a lot of sick and crippled people. Christ is in every sick person. But if that sick person is poor, Christ is in them twice. We'll get rid of this bushwood, we'll cut into the mountain and make a hole in those rocks. We'll build a big house in which people will get relief from their suffering. And remember what I say... we'll have the best doctors in the world. Sure, but who'll give us the money? Don't worry, Our Lady knows how to open the people's hearts. She'll know how to open the people's wallets. These are airplanes! Let's go, father. More than a hundred people died in Benevento yesterday. There's no danger for us, then. We're just two. So? What did Maria Pyle do? She sold the last things she had, and she put together more then 20 million. If we add them to the 10 we already have, we get 30 million. But it isn't enough, you know? It's not enough for what I have in mind. We would need a miracle. A miracle... or someone who knows how to cheat the devil. Hey, you scoundrel... Come here. How are you? -I'm fine, father.. and you? Come on, give me a kiss. So how did it go? -I made it. I sold... You're free to speak, he's Angelo Battisti. I'm sorry. Emanuele Brunatto, pleased to meet you. It was difficult, there are many Germans in Paris. But a bargain is a bargain, even in wartime. This is a credit note for 3 million French francs. Fine, give it to him. He's our accountant. Now, tell me all the atrocities you did in Paris to get it, in the confessional. Not much. -Not much? We'll see if it's not much! May I come in, Father? Father, this is engineer Candeloro. Welcome, engineer. -Father. Father, I must apologize to you. -Please, engineer, don't worry. Your project is wonderful. Father, my name's not Candeloro. My name's Angiolino Lupi, and I'm not a real engineer, I'm a photographer. This guy's not an engineer? What is it you do? -I'm a photographer, Father. To tell the truth, you're not a photographer either, huh? Do you remember photographing corpses, moistening the faces so they look alive? Do you remember that? Then you tried to be a carpenter, didn't you? Then you tried to be a mason. But most of all you've been a con man, eh? And now you've come here to me. Now you only have to think about building your project. But I can't, Father. Why? Why can't you? An engineer in Foggia sued me for fraud. I'm going to be prosecuted, Father. This engineer in Foggia, who game him his degree? Who gave it to him? Some professor? You received yours from the Lord himself. Take a picture with Padre Pio! A picture against bad luck! Take a picture with Padre Pio! No, no. Look this way, please. Come on, madam, smile for me. Otherwise, what's the point of taking it? Don't move, please. I'll count to three... one, two, three! They're all handmade, it's rare stuff, you know? Come on, take a picture with Padre Pio! Hurry up! A picture against bad luck! A picture against the evil eye! Well? What do you think you're doing?! Father, I'm just working... Would you stop this prank?! Go away! Go away! Go! Is this a market? Is this a market? Is it?! This place is for praying. People are supposed to come here to pray. Go away... Go home. A nice gesture. How demonstrative! But it doesn't seem that you were listened to. This town has become the industry of 'the friar with the stigmata'. They don't have anything. But you corrupted them. And he who abuses the poverty of his brothers, is guilty inside and in front of God. I just tried to help them. -No... You played on people's fear. During the war, it was easy to say "this one will come back and this one won't" You relied on the law of averages to build up your fame as a saint! I'm not a saint. Stop it with this false humility! You've always played the part of the victim, the persecuted. You always made them believe that the Church was against you! It's not true... -I know it's not true! Those were ostracizing Popes, but others like Pope Pacelli, Montini defended you! I have always loved the Church. If you keep refusing to admit your sins, hen you're unjustifiable, and I ask myself what am I doing here! I'm just wasting my time! You don't need me, but a doctor. I'll go and call someone. -No, wait... Wait.... Don't leave me alone. I want to tell you something. That happened many years ago. What's happening? There's still all these people. You're too tired now. They'll come back tomorrow, don't worry. Tomorrow... But these people need to talk. Who's there? There's a young priest waiting for you. He's come from far away. Then I can't refuse to see him. What's your name? Karol Wojtyla. Come here, boy. Let's pray together. We prayed together all night. And I still pray for him. One day, he'll become Pope. A good Pope. Remember this... So you'll know if I'm telling the truth. Do you want to rest or shall we go on? In my village, they say that there are three useless things. To wash the head of a donkey, to pour water in the sea, and to talk with priests. You know... We've met before. Many years ago... You passed by. Without even looking at me. Please, Father... please! He's calling you. He's calling you. They want to kill me! Please absolve me! I don't want to die condemned! Why don't you absolve him? He's just a boy. Please, help him. Why don't you absolve him? Can't you see? He needs you. Help him. Help him. Help him. Are you telling me you were in two places at the same time? Do you know that in other times, you would have been accused of sorcery? And that the only true symbol for the Christian is Jesus Christ himself? I just brought Christ within my flesh. Are you telling me that you consider yourself another Christ? Some sort of... Co-Redeemer? No. Isn't that what you want others to believe? I... I just shared his suffering. Francesco. Dad... come here. Sit down here. Francesco. I want to go. -Here. I want to go back to Pietrelcina. Alright, father. Return there. But I don't have the money for the trip. Give me some. Me? Father, I don't have any money. -What do you mean by that? They send you money from everywhere. Father, the money is not mine. We need it to build the hospital. Why don't you stay here? What kind of a son are you? I went to America twice... to earn the money so you could study. And now you can't give me the money. I need to go back to Pietrelcina. Father... Father, I don't have any money. Father! Father, what's wrong?! What's wrong, father?! I need help! Father, you have to confess your sins. Why, am I so sick? Yes... Please, Francesco. If you talk with Him, maybe... he'll cure me. I can't, Father... We have an agreement. I can't ask Him anything for myself. I can ask Him miracles for others, but not for me. I'm afraid. I don't want to die. Talk with Him, Francesco, He will listen to you. I can't... Please, confess. Are you ashamed, father? Let's do it this way, father. I will tell your sins, and you'll just say... "Forgive me, Lord", alright? Alright. For that time you betrayed mom with that American woman. How do you know about it? Father... Just say "Forgive me, Lord". Forgive me, Lord. For that time you sold three sheep, without telling us. Forgive me, Lord. For that time you got drunk, and you beat Michele during an argument. Forgive me, Lord. For all the times you sent mom to work in the fields even while she's pregnant. Forgive me, Lord. That's it, dad. For all your sins, I absolve you. In the name of the Father, the Son... and the Holy Spirit. Francesco. Hold my hand. Did He forgive me? I told Him that my father has calloused hands. But his heart is tender. I love you, father. Me too, Francesco. Me too... Francesco... Francesco... You're so worried about helping others, and you can't help the people you love. Why don't you take some satisfaction? I brought you someone to sweeten your life. Go away... Go away, you filthy beast! She's down in the basement. She's waiting for you. Go! She's there, ready for you. How stupid of you. If you don't take this chance, someone else will. Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Cleonice... Can't you see? I brought her here for you. Come on, take advantage of her. Take advantage of her! You're so stupid. -Leave her alone. You fool. -Leave her alone. Do you know who she is? It's Lea Padovani. Holy Mother! She looks better in the flesh than on the screen. Mrs. Padovani, can I have your autograph? You can start, my dear. But please, remember that you can't act here. You must tell the truth. I'm not here for me, father, but for the man I love. Yeah, I know that you love him. But I also know that he's not "your man". He's married to another woman, isn't he? He suffers from a bad illness. The doctors gave him only a few months to live. But you can't do anything to save him. And if you don't leave him, you'll be making him die a sinner. But father, I love him. How can I leave him? You have to choose. Between your love and this life. Now, you'd better go. But father, I can't. -Stop it! What, do you expect me to absolve you?! Suffer, if you can. Shut up and pray. Go, now. -But, Father... Excuse me. So, my dear. Have you decided? I will leave him, father. I will leave him, so that he'll live. He will live, yes, he will. What about me? You will always have a friend in Jesus. You will never be alone. Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Father. -Yes? I want to become your daughter. You already are. You always have been. Home for the relief of suffering Brothers and sisters. The "Home for the relief of suffering" has finally been completed. I thank to all the benefactors from all over the world. This is the creature that Providence, with your help, brought to us. Let me introduce you. Admire it, and bless it along with us. And please keep working, for this mission of succor for wounded souls and bodies. You doctors have a mission, that is to cure your patients. You'll have to bring love to their bedside, because drugs are not enough. And, remember one more thing. Hospitals are for patients, not for doctors. Alright? How do they say? It's better to be a mouse in between two cats, than a patient in between two doctors. Now it's time to go, before I catch some illness myself! Sit, Father. We don't have much time. -No, thanks. I prefer standing. If you all came here for me, It must be something serious. What have I done this time? No... This time we're not here to punish you. This time, we need you... We gave our trust to a banker who didn't deserve it. We gave him all our money to invest. We planned to build new convents with the proceeds. But this person went bankrupt, and now we have to refund the money to all the faithful who entrusted their savings to us. And this 'God's banker', this 'wizard of finance'... what interest rate did he promise you? -Up to 90 percent. And we're not the only religious order involved, but many others as well. If we don't solve this problem, we'll be overwhelmed by a huge scandal. Well, I... I can only pray for you. Hoping that the Lord will listen. Maybe you didn't understand, Father. We need the money that you put together for the hospital. That money was given to me so that I could... do some charitable work for the sick. Not to pay your debts. I think I should remind you that you made a vow of obedience. I'll obey... Alright, I'll obey. Here, I'll give you everything I have, here it is. Here's a candy, take it. But the money for the hospital... will not be touched! Is this your final word? I have only one word, and I keep it. The war has started again, eh? Well... what can we do about it? It's Satan, he puts brother against brother. They're trying to rob you. This time, you'll have to defend yourself. I can't stand it anymore, Emanuele... I'm tired. I just pray to God, I want Him to call me home as soon as possible. I want Him to release me. I can't disappoint the Lord again. But I can. How old are you, Emanuele? I'm 70, Father... Why? You still want to kick up the dust? You're not young anymore, come on. Think about saving your soul. I can't see you like this. The same thing happened to Jesus. Hey... how are you all doing? Hey, look at me. Look what I brought you. See? Come on, Pellegrino. Get some paper and a pen, and start writing. "Dearest Giuseppe, don't worry, Padre Pio will pray for your wife's health. But you keep praying too, alright? Together, we will be stronger." -Father, did you call me? Since Our Lady decided that I have to stay here, let's do our best, Pellegrino. We can only fight evil with our hard work. Let's see. Pellegrino, look... When you answer these letters, put some money in the envelope. These people need some help. Don't forget it. Gemma... This is Gemma, Pellegrino, do you remember her? She was born without pupils... but now she can see. And she goes to school. Angelo, come here. Listen. You have to find some places, they must be big. We have to open up consumers' co-operative. Any problem you have, just let me know. -Alright, thank you. -Go now. Angelo, one more thing. Our prices must be much, much lower than the communists'. Alright. -Is it clear? Right. Cleonice... I baked you your favorite cake. -Ah, thank you. What a nice smell, it must be good. Thank you. Cleonice, there is a bad atmosphere around here, you know? It would be better if you don't come to the convent for a while. No, I can't stay away from you. But you would still have Jesus, no? And he's much more important than me, don't you think? Don't worry. You will always have a place in my heart. What will you do, Father? Why don't you gift me this handkerchief? That way I can wave to you from above. Why would you have to wave goodbye to me? Where are you going? Around. To stir up a little trouble. You'll see, Cleonice. I'll cause a lot more uproar dead than alive. You'll see... -What are you talking about? You will always be with us. Agostino. Agostino! I prayed so much to see you again! Forgive me. Forgive me... -Why? You've been my teacher. You've taught me everything I know. I didn't defend my son. -No. I didn't defend my son. -It's not true. Again... They will attack you again. Don't worry about me. -Pio... My son... Forgive me. Do you want to renew your profession? My profession? I will renew it for you, alright? I, Father Agostino from San Marco in Lamis, vow and promise to God the Father Almighty, and to our blessed father Saint Francis, for all my life to be faithful to the rule of the minor friars. Living in submission, without any possession. And in chastity. And I... Padre Pio from Pietrelcina, if you will respect these rules, I promise you on behalf of God... eternal life. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus... Would you leave us, please. First I want to know why you have not yet transferred the shares of the "Home for the relief of suffering" to the IOR, as you were ordered to. Recently, I haven't felt very well. It is inconceivable that a friar, who has taken the vow of poverty, should manage hundreds of millions. I never managed anything, the board of directors took care of it. Anyway... give me the papers and I'll sign whatever you want. I'll sign everything, just let me do my duty as a priest. We have to speak about that as well. I'll be honest with you. I've never believed you. You're a visionary, and by thinking intensively that you were Christ crucified, you made the stigmata appear. So, try to think intensely that you are an ox, let's see if a pair of horns appear on your head. It's been said that you have had... "intimate" relationships, with some of the women from your prayer groups. It's not true, these are false accusations. But you can't deny having a "privileged" relationship with a Cleonice Morcaldi? This is true... I don't deny this. Cleonice is my dearest daughter. Even Saint Francis had Clare. -But Clare... entered a convent, while Cleonice entered into your cell. Cleonice was a rebel, if I hadn't been close to her, she would have been lost! You... saved her?Or have you damned her? Poor girl... How much backbiting she had to endure. She's been the only one to stay close to me, you know? I too, need to be comforted. So, you admit your weakness? Your relationship with Cleonice was not just a spiritual one~ Now stop it! Stop it! Who authorized you to come here and insult me?! Can't you see me? I'm 70 years old, I'm old, I'm sick and tired! And you have the nerve to come here and accuse me of sin with women! I am searching for the truth. No... no, you're looking for lies! And in order to find them, you've become a blasphemer! A bishop who steals God's most sacred secrets! Who gave the order to put microphones in my confessional?! It wasn't me. I didn't give that order. Oh yeah? This time I'm the one who doesn't believe. You knew about it, and you didn't move a finger. Where are you going? I order you to stay where you are. We aren't finished yet! But I am. I am! If you have any orders form, write me a letter, I receive so many that reading one more won't do me any harm. Padre Pio! Padre Pio, are you alright? Hurry up, go to the hospital and bring back a doctor! Help me... Help me... Help me. What happened? What's this sign?! What's this sign?! Don't wait for him, it's useless! I did it. I beat him to a pulp. I beat him up! I beat the stuffing out of him! I beat him to a pulp! I was right... the old man won't come down to say mass! What are you doing, Father? You should stay in bed. He thinks he's defeated me. He doesn't know that this is the last battle. My last duel with him. And I can't lose it. Why is there evil in this world? Now listen to me. There is a mother who's embroidering on a frame, and her child is sitting by her side on a small stool. The child is watching his mother work, but he's watching her from below, like this... And he tells her: "What are you doing, mom? This embroidery is ugly!". So, the mother... lowers the frame, and shows him the right side of the work. With the colors on their right place, and the threads forming a harmonious pattern. Go away! Go away! Go away! Bring her here. What, are you still standing on your feet? In the name of Jesus Christ, I order you, Satan, to leave in peace. Leave in peace. In the name of Jesus Christ, I order you, Satan... to leave in peace. Leave in peace. Help me. That's it... did you see what evil is like? Evil is like... the reverse side of that embroidery. We're all sitting on a small stool. There. That is my story. The story of a farmer's son, who came here as a poor man. And who's leaving as a poor man. It's true, I made many mistakes. And maybe there is no worse man than me in this world, I've been ignorant and rude. And I caused you a lot of trouble, but I think I paid enough. Am I boring you? Please, go on. You said that I... exploited the people's faith, that I deceived them. But I.. I had to choose. Between the Church's judgment... and poverty, and despair. Christ grabbed me, and told me to carry on. I.. I don't know what the Lord's plans are, It could be that I imagined everything. And now... Even if you don't want to... please. Absolve me. Don't let me die like this, like that poor boy. Which boy? That boy, during the war... Help me, Father, please! Help me, please! They want to kill me! Please, absolve me! I don't want to die condemned! You never forgave yourself, did you? Fear is a human emotion, and anyway, I absolved him for you. Now... please take care of me. Father... What are you talking about? It's you who should absolve we. No, you only did what you believed was right. Then, as well as now. But I've persecuted you, judged you and condemned you. The Church only did its duty, and if you didn't persecute me, I would never have been saved. God, such a blindness... Often, like the disciples of the Emmaus, Christ passes us buy. Walks with us... And we don't recognize him. I wonder... If you and God will ever forgive me. We already have. But now it's you who has to absolve me. With the power conferred on me by the Holy Church, I absolve you of all your sins. In the name of the Father, the Son... and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Go now. I've already taken too much of your time. Before leaving, however... I want you to know that... the Holy Father thinks of you with great affection. Thank you. He's a very good Pope. Ask him to say a prayer for me. No, Father... It is he who asks you to say a prayer... and I'm asking you too, please pray for me. How many gifts... How many good things.. How many miracles you gave me. You came to live, and to suffer, inside my body. Me in you... And you in me. What a great mystery. Thank you, my Lord. Alright... I'm ready. Take me when you want. I... Padre Pio from Pietrelcina.... vow and promise... to be faithful for all my life... to the rule, and the life... of the minor friars. Why not give me the handkerchief, so I can wave to you from above? Why would you do that? Where are you going? Around. To stir up a little trouble. Padre Pio died on September 23rd in 1968. On May 2nd, 1999, Papa Giovanni Paolo II proclaimed him beatified Every year, more than seven million followers go to San Giovanni Rotondo to visit his grave. dedicated to Alberto Soffientini
