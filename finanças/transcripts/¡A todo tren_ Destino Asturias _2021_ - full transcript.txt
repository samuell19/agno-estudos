THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT For scrapes, for blisters, for cold sores, sleeping pills, diarrhea pills, laxative pills... Marcos! That's enough with the backpack -we're going to miss the train! -But it's five hours from now. Son, what if we hit a traffic jam? But we're taking the subway. What if it breaks down? But, it's... Stop making excuses and finish with the backpack! Now I'm not even sure if I put the bandages in or not... What's that, a portable drugstore? He's only going for a week, and they have everything at camp. This isn't for him. It's for me. -Dad... -What? How long is the train ride? Let's see, you tell me. The train runs at an average speed of 150 km per hour and it has to travel the length... Jeez dad, no! I'm on vacation! It's a simple, easy peasy... besides, you passed Math. No. Wait, what? You faked his grades? When were you going to tell me? When he was at camp. Hadn't we agreed, either he passed or he wasn't going to ski week? That's why I kept it from you! I need a break! Okay, it'll be good to have some time alone. Yes. But to decide how to organize things from now on. Use that quality time on the train together to let him know what's going on. If it were just us two but half the school is coming. Exaggerations! Just six kids, and one of the moms is coming, right? Yeah, Clara. If it weren't for her, -I'd shoot myself. -Okay so don't worry, we'll tell him together when he's home... So we don't ruin his vacation and afterwards, maybe... Afterwards, you'll have to face it. There's no solution to this. Dad... I'm off to my meeting. Honey, promise me... that you'll behave with dad. He gets anxious easily. And you, let him breathe. But also don't let him walk all over you. You think I'm pusillanimous. I don't think it. I know it. Marcos, what're you doing in flip-flops and a bathing suit? It's the middle of February... We're going to Asturias, aren't we? It's warmer down south. Down south? Asturias is completely north. Oh, I mix it up with the other one -that starts with an "a" -Which one? Andalusia. Where's that one? Did you pass geography? Nah. Not that one either. What? How many did you fail? I'm not exactly sure... remember, one of them was Math. Clara! I was going to call you. We should meet an hour early at the station, just in case, right? Well, speaking of just in case, you're going to laugh but... I'm not going to be able to go. What? Something's come up at work and I have to stay. But don't panic! I'm taking care of it. I asked my cousin Antonio, a teacher and camp counselor to help. He said he can probably go. He's calling me back now. Wait, so if he can't come, I go alone with six kids to Asturias? No, man, no... there are seven kids. What? Remember my friend, Susana? The nutcase? She's asked me if we could take her kid too, and I couldn't refuse. That would make your two kids, mine, Lara and her cousin...by myself ? her cousin Fernandito... and Susana's son. Exactly. No... No way in hell... Calm down, my cousin can surely lend you a hand.. I hope so. I won't go alone. Remember last year when Pablo's mom took the whole class to the zoo and the parents made a huge fuss because two sweaters were switched. Not that big of a fuss, really. Clara, she took her kid out of school in the middle of the year. Okay, you're right. But take it easy. I'm sure my cousin will come through. And if not, I'll find someone else, no matter what. I'll call you. Come on kids. Finish up with the backpacks. Diana? Mom, I can't. My nails aren't dry. Hi, grandpa. What's up, grandson? Family! Babygirl! Grandpa! Nachete? Grandpa, I told you a million times, it's Ignacio. Such an odd kid... Dad, what're you doing here? What do you mean? I came to take the kids to the movies. Movie day was yesterday. Yesterday? What day is today? The day they leave for camp. Well, only if mom gets someone who can come, 'cause she can't. What? Something came up at work and I have to stay. I'm looking for a trustworthy person to take them. Look no further. I'll go. I said trustworthy. You don't trust me? I'm an exemplary grandparent. You are quite an example, of what not to do. The movie date was yesterday and you show up today! So I was a little late. What's important is I came. I do what I say. Don't I? Come on dear, trust me. Trust you? How can I trust you, dad? If every time you take them there's trouble. Trouble? When did I cause trouble? When you told me you were taking them out for some mountain air. I didn't lie. Yippee! Again! Yippee! Or when you said you were taking them out for some sports. And I did just that. So you can imagine, you're not taking my kids anywhere. Fine... but it's complicated... Where are you going to find a dupe to do the job for you. Well, I'm waiting on cousin Dupe, I mean, Antonio to call. Ah, just in time. Here he is. There. Where are these people? We've been waiting for an hour. 'Cause we got here two hours before the train leaves. And now Clara won't pick up. Dad... they're all there. -Look. -Let's go. Well it's about time. Where were you? At the meeting point we'd agreed on. Where's Clara? Clara couldn't make it in the end. She's arranging to have her cousin come help me. If not, you're stuck with the kids? That sucks. Sucks? If he can't come in the end... one of you will have to come. This is an emergency. Uh, impossible. We fly out to Punta Cana tonight. Not me. Who in their right mind takes an overnight train? -Yeah. Who does that? -Hey, hey... It was going to be me and my son alone, in an overnight berth fun plans, quiet ride, you wanted your kids to tag along so if you want them to go by package service, fine by me. Easy, don't take it that way. You're going to do just fine. Besides, they're so well-behaved. Right. Any hyperactive ones? See? He's even giving me the evil eye. I really can't go alone. My God, Ricardo, his nerves are shot. Right? Very important: my niece wears a mouth guard. -Who's your niece? -My daughter. She needs it on before bed. I'd better give it to you. -Don't let mine be on TikTok long. -On what? -And, no candy for Fernando. -No, no candy. Put them all under parental control. Hand me your cell. Here are the flies to feed the bearded dragon. Get out... A bearded dragon? Stop! Just a minute, I can't breathe! No way! I can't do this alone! He's right! This man can't go alone with the kids. Finally, a reasonable person! -Thank you ma'am. -Thank you. -You'd come with me? -If you pay for my ticket. If I pay for your ticket? Which of these are you with? None. I'm from Cuenca, on my way to take the train, but I heard your conversation... Lady, please , move along! Okay... Look... It's Clara. Ricardo! Finally! I was gonna have a conniption. Your cousin's coming? Yes! No worries! It's all arranged. -Thank goodness! -They'll be there in ten minutes. I'll send you a picture so you'll recognize him. Of course, he'll be the one with the kids. It's all sorted. Her cousin's coming. -Great! -Great! Pose. I'll never forgive you for this. Quiet! Pose. Smile. There. I'm just giving you this chance because Antonio refused. But please don't tell Ricardo who you are until the train's gone. Because with all the stuff I've told him about you, he would never get on. This is humiliating. You know that... Well it is what it is. There. And it's your last chance, dad. If you pull another one of your tricks, you can forget the grandkids. -Good afternoon, sir. -Hello. Wow, look at all these kids... I love kids... Hi kid... first time on a train? What a nice kid... So sweet! Look at those cheeks... Healthy, eh? Hey Lucas, what're you doing here? Weren't you on sick leave? -Not contagious are you? -No, sir. -No, relax. -He's got the heebie-jeebies. Heebie-jeebies? What? No. Stress . Says it's stress. It's no wonder I have stress. I always have to do everything. -Is the train on time? -Yes, sir. Ten minutes. Our party's not all here. I hope they make it. Lucas, is it a good idea that you join this trip, after what happened? After what happened? I'm referring to the episode. That? That was nothing. Ask the parents of the kid you dragged by the ear through four train cars. Anyone could lose their patience. Besides, I did therapy for that. Yes, Lucas, but you said the therapy was 6 months. But they saw my progress and released me. Relax, it's under control. Thank Goodness. I thought we missed the train. Has a man gone in with a bunch of kids? A redhead? It's a blind date set up by my daughter. Yes, he's already on board. Of course, those two are going to meet up with the other four and they're going to mess it up. Lord, here we go. Look, this is ours. -You must be Ricardo. -Yes. -Felipe. Pleased to meet you. -Clara said your name was Antonio. That's right. Antonio Felipe. Glad to see you. You're a lifesaver. I'll show you the compartments. And their bunks. Come on kids. We'll be very comfortable. No problem, so we'll be there before you know it. Due to a technical difficulty departure will be delated for at least 20 minutes. Look at that. After rushing to be here on time. I'm going for a cig. You coming? No, I don't smoke. Besides, we can't leave the kids alone. What's the big deal? We're right here... Come on. Okay. Kids, don't leave the compartment, okay? Just for a minute. Right out here. -Okay, dad. -See you later. Incredible, my dad never leaves me alone. We have to take advantage. I'm scared. I want them to come. Come on, don't be a wuss. -Wanna play something? -I can't my nails are still drying. You painted them two hours ago. You paint your nails? When they dry if you want, I'll do your makeup... because your skin looks a little drab to me. Huh? You must already be about 8 or 9? It's normal... -I'm scared... -Me too. Well I'm hungry. Did you bring anything to eat? Oh no? Then what's that? Thank goodness you came. I thought Clara might try to sneak her dad by me who I hear is a real piece of work. Well my cousin's no angel either. I could tell you some stories... you wouldn't believe... Women are very complicated. I hear you! What's your wife like? We're going through a rough patch... Divorce? Well... This kid always gives me a start. What's wrong Fernandito? Nacho wants to eat my bearded dragon's flies! Damn this trip's going to be long... Miss, please. Can I help? Thanks a lot. That's not sexism, is it? 'cause you never know. It's micro-sexism but I'll give you a pass. Oh well, if it's only micro. Such a pretty girl can't be allowed to carry so much weight. Well now you tell me... Where shall I insert it? The suitcase! I'll take it to my seat by myself, thank you. No, for heaven's sake! I'll carry you and your suitcase... to wherever you're going if necessary. You're a real gentleman. Like before. Way before. Nacho, don't eat Fernando's flies. They're for "Chuski". His name is "Chuspi": Whatever. But your fighting is scaring Cris. But I'm hungry. Dad, come on, give us money to go to the cafeteria! No. Wait 'til dinner time. An hour won't make much difference. You want to starve us. I'm calling my mom. Wait, wait. Nacho, listen. We have to lay some ground rules. You can't call you parents every 5 minutes. When the train leaves I'll take you to the café car, okay? Marcos, you're watching here. I'm going to look for Antonio. It's not too long before we leave and he's still outside. Where's he got to? What's he doing there? Antonio! Antonio! You touched my ass. Sorry! It was accidental. I was pushed. A shame, because this ass's entirely at your disposal. Hey guys, look what I have. I took it from my dad while he was talking to Nacho. Who wants to come get candy? Passengers please be advised that we have been able to fix the problem ahead of schedule and will depart in one minute. Wait here! I'll be right back! -But Ricardo's not here. -Tell him to hurry up! Antonio! I'm an admirer, a friend, a slave, your servant... What're you doing here? For cripes sake, keep your pants on. There's still 10 minutes before they fix the problem. Can you give me your name so I can follow you on Facebook? Facebook? I'm not on Facebook. Wow. So young and you don't use the new technologies... Antonio, come on Antonio! Okay, grumpy, let's go... Goodbye, señorita! Goodbye, goodbye. That's our train! It's leaving! Marcos! Marcos! Marcos! Dad! Stop! -Dad! -Marcos! Marcos! I can't believe it. And you were going to come help? Why were you on the other train? Hey, I'm not the one who got off and left the kids alone. It's a good thing you're the responsible family member. I'd have been better off with her grandpa. Oh yeah? Well I'm the grandpa. What? Clara said not to tell you until the train left, and it's gone, so... I'll kill her! I'll kill her! Quiet, fool! You can't tell her or she'll kill me. I'm going to call someone to see if they can stop the train. Everyone can't find out or I'll never see my grandkids. They'd be better off. The way things are with you guys, you won't see your kid either. My wife knows me. She'll know this isn't my fault. What about the other mom's kids? You forgot what happened to Pablo's mom? What're we going to do? I'm calling Marcos. Pick up, Marcos. Guys, I have good and bad news. The bad news is the adults missed the train. And the good news? The adults missed the train. He's not picking up. Calm down! Can't. My pills are on the train. Relax. Let me think. The train arrives in the morning. With a rental car we can arrive in 5 hours, we can even stop, eat and take in the scenery. The kids are in a train. What could happen? Marcos! Son. Are you okay? Of course, dad. Calm down. Why wouldn't you pick up? Don't worry. We're going to rent a car. When you arrive at the next stop, we'll be waiting for you. Don't tell anyone. You'll have to take everyone's phone. It's very important that none of the parents find out. Ah, one more thing; if your mom calls don't pick up. Agreed? Tell me and I'll call her right back. This is going to cost you. Not if she doesn't find out. That's why I need your help. No, my help's going to cost you. Are you blackmailing me? Look... No, dad. Son, we're going to get the car. I'll call you back when we're on the road. I trust you, eh? Sure. Did you talk to him? What did he say? Where are the rental cars now? Ricardo! Ricardo! We're here! -Who's that? -Crap! Clara's friend. I forgot her. I can't believe you're still here. I thought the train had left. No, it hasn't. Look, it's here... You're lucky, there was a technical thing but we're leaving now. Thank God. He'd locked himself in and wouldn't come out. They let me come to the platform so he wouldn't get away. Here, take care of him and watch his every move. I'm leaving you in good hands. The train is about to depart. Thank you very much. You can leave now. No, no. I'm staying until the train pulls out. Get on. Go on. I don't trust this one. Besides, I have nothing else to do. Looks like we'll have to get on. Let's go. Come on, kid. Let's go. I can hardly breathe! Relax, relax... -What's wrong? -This isn't our train, we'd just missed it when you guys arrived! -Why'd we get on then? -'Cause your mom would've told all the moms and everyone would know we left the kids on the other train. So you left the other kids and we're not going to camp. -Cool! Where're we going? -Damn this kid. Those little balls on your brow are pinching your brain. Right? Now we've really screwed up. Don't worry. I'm a doctor. What? -What are you talking about? -I don't know. You're a hypochondriac. I thought it would calm you down. I looked on the map for this route and heads in the same direction until the next station. Then it heads in another. We get off there and grab the next train that goes to our train's first stop. We'll board there. See how easy? I'm hungry. Can you buy me some chips, or something? Yeah. Here. Where's my wallet? Twelve hamburgers. And 10 bags of popcorn! 4 orders of spaghetti. And 14 sodas, with lots of gas! And caffeine! I don't see it. Too many things. Where are your parents? In the train compartment. If we take too long they'll get mad. Sure. Tell them to come and order, okay? It's him asking for his burgers. Marcos, did you take my wallet? Yes, dad. But this waiter here doesn't want to give us the 12 burgers we ordered. 12 what? Don't you dare! I told him we have permission but he doesn't believe me. Tell him yourself so he doesn't make you or mom come. Hello. Hey, hello. Should I give them their order? Sure, give them whatever they order. except mustard. They're allergic. Crazy. Great, dad. Anything else I can do for you? Marcos, you're dead. At least chew slowly. You'll get sick if not. We're going to get on your train at the next station. Stay put in the compartment. And above all, avoid the ticket inspector. There's a prize for the one who hides best from him. Come on, dad, that's for little kids. The ticket inspector, hide from him! I'll call you back. In the bathroom. Let's go. Why're we hiding? Because we don't have tickets, duh. 12 hamburgers. They'll be sick. Don't talk about that now. I'm hungry. -Please give him something already! -You're a real pain, kid. My wallet? The kids took yours too ? Do you think I'm a dupe like he is? You touched my ass. Sorry, I was pushed. Dirty sneak! We'll have to explain our problem to the inspector. He'll understand. And we'll get hit with a fine that'll cost a bundle. Just a minute. That woman's still here. She's gonna freak when she sees us. Car eight. You guys are fat. What're you doing here again? My wallet. Give it to me. -Your what? -My wallet. I know you took out of my wallet when I put your suitcase up. Is this what you do? Pick-pocketing? What're you talking about? -Your purse! -Hey, my bag! Give me back my purse! Hey, give me back my purse! What's going on here? This man wants to take my purse! No, sir, this woman purposely looks hot to be able to rob people. What? You get what I mean. I helped her get her bag up there and she took my wallet. I didn't steal anything. Let's see. Your tickets? They're in the wallet. And yours? Mine too. Except for the wallets and fine we're on track. We wanted to get out here. Now what do we do? How do we get to the station where our train stops from this place? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You're a doctor. Of course! Great idea! I need an ambulance at the Medineja train station. Somebody's fallen on the tracks. I saved him, but he's unconscious. Come quick. Free fast speed transportation to Valladolid. Traffic jam-proof. That somebody's me ? -No, me , what do you think? -That's the plan. We get to the hospital, the doors open, and we take off running. I'm the one that needs a hospital. Drop to the floor, they could be back any minute. No way, I'm not doing that. It's Clara. Pick up. I can't. I can't lie. She'll know. -Pick up. If you don't she'll call the kid. -Give it to me. -I'll pick up. -Shut your mouth! Drop down now or I'll do it for you. You leave that thing alone. It's gonna run out! Clara, how are you? How's it going with... my dad? Look, I didn't call you because I thought you might be mad. But I swear I had no other option. I was really mad at first, but he's really behaving well. Really? Hasn't screwed up yet? Is he good with the kids? Yeah. Fantastic! Well... he says he's changed. Maybe it's true. I told him it was his last chance. Well he's taking it seriously now. Can I speak to him a minute? I called you because I can't believe a word he says. He's playing with the kids right now. In fact, I have to lend him a hand. We'll talk later. I'm headed for a breakdown. I'm not made for this. You're doing a great job! And you, learn from this, teamwork gets you outta scrapes. I'm not in a scrape. You guys are the ones in hot water. What if your mom finds out? Who do you think she'll believe? Who's going to be grounded until 2030? That's if you don't get sent to reform school. It's got to be better than this camp. Oh yeah? Ricardo, call this kid's mom. Me? Why me? Loser. They're here Play dead or you'll be dead! What happened? He fell on the tracks. Not from too high, but he hit his head. He's still unconscious? He's conscious. But he seems dazed. He's a doctor. No, I'm not. He's making it up... but he looks dazed. You said you were a doctor. I just said it so you'd calm down. We'll take him. Wait, wait. What about us? He's a minor, one person can go with him in the ambulance. -I'll go. -You're going to leave me here? I'm dizzy. We can't leave the man like this. Okay. But this is highly irregular. Hey, could you give me a little? Fernandito, it's your third, you're going to pop. He's pigging out. They're just so good. And the caffeine wasn't a great idea. More. Dude, I gotta tell you. A hottie just sat next to me and of course we started to talk. I bought her coffee. Hey kids, kids! You wanna cut the crap already? What's the deal? No parents? Hey, have you finished eating? Pick up the trash then and free up the table. People are waiting. Come on! Okay, kids, let's go. No. She's in the bathroom now. She so hot. I've got her in the bag. In the bag. I'll tell you later. Let's go. Obey your elders, that's right. -Come on, let's go. -I'm scared. -It's not fair. -I wasn't finished. Where is she going? He's on a date with her? Well then... Wait here. This jerk's gonna regret it. Diana, come with me. Okay. Dad, you're here. We looked everywhere for you. Mom says to come now. What's going on here? I dunno. I don't know these girls. I don't have a wife or kids. Dad... you can't say that about us. You want me to do your makeup? You look a little pale. Get outta my face. I'm the one who's getting out right now. You're pathetic! Good bye ! Damn kids. Happy now? Sorry, I thought you were my dad. He looks just like you, but with green eyes. Bye bye! Did you see that? They're evil little monsters. Kids! I'm watching you guys. EMERGENCY ROOM Now! Where are you going? -I'm not running any more. -Me neither. Dudes, I helped you get here but from now on we're all on our own. -Come back here, blockhead. -What're you doing? Marcos! Yes. It's me. Everything okay? Fine. I gotta let you go. Are you alright? Why're you panting? Because I'm running. On the train? I need to take a whiz. Talk later. I ran over him! Yes, siree. Thanks a lot. That's enough from you! From now on, I'll keep the backpack. You're not getting away again. Excuse me, how long does it take to walk to the station from here? Walking takes at least 20 minutes, taxi, three minutes. Drive you there? Come on! Come on, stop exaggerating, it wasn't that bad. Hey! What the... A taxi? With no money? Calm down, I explained and it's cool. We should've asked at the train too, good people want to help. Thank you, sir. You saved our life. Message from Marcos. He hit his head! DAD You're going too far! I'm doing it for his own good, to wake him up. He believes everything. Now he doesn't even pick up. I'm calling the police. Gimme that. Let's see. Look, dummy. It's ketchup. I'll kill him. Let's get going. Diana, stop or you'll go out to the aisle. Your turn. Truth or dare? Truth. Do you like Lara? Dare. I prefer dare. -Ready. -What? That'll be 8'20. -Now run! -What're you doing? Sorry. I didn't know. We don't have any money. I'll pulverize you! -I'm sorry, we have to go! -No you don't! Deadbeat! I'm going to kill you! If I told you we were doing that you wouldn't have gotten in. -It just got here. -It's platform 3. Run! Marcos, we're almost there! Dad, we're not on the train. What? The inspector made us get off. Where are you? At the station. In a room. Felipe, they're not on the train. What? Give that to me. Kid, put Nacho on. I don't trust you. Show us your stuff. Grandpa. It's true. They took us to a room. -There. -Come on, run! Calm down. We're almost there. We're here! Where are you? On the train, losers. No! The train's leaving again! I'm no good at this. Well you should've told the truth. My grandkid pulled one over me. I can't believe it. Me neither. Boomers. Well, well, how much time can we keep up the fun? Keep in mind that this is a tourist train and travels around 1000 km, at an average speed of 150 km per hour, you figure it out. Damn! Every moment it's clearer. Our dads were switched at birth. I shouldn't have lied to my grandpa! We can't spend so much time without responsible adult supervision. And I'm scared of the fat guy on the train. I want my mamma. Guys, we can't waste this chance to do whatever we want. It won't happen again until we're old. I don't mind waiting 'til I'm older to do older kid things. But when you get older And when you can do them, you'll only want to do boring things. It's now or never. I give up. It's over. I can't take it anymore. I have no strength left. Or air. So with the power I have left I'm calling Clara. Over my dead body. We can't give up so soon. Felipe, we have no money. We can't do anything. Well, I have a little. -What? -You've had money all this time? Mom said only for emergencies. How much do you have? 50 euros. Can't rent a car with that. -I'm calling Clara. -Wait. Not a whole one, but we could share one. Share? Look man, wake up. It's an app. To save money you ride with people going to the same place, and pay half the gas.. This car's perfect and it's close to us. Three seats, 15 euros each and we'll still have 5 left over. Ready. They'll pick us up in 10 minutes. All set, and no battery waste. Ye man of little faith. They're heading to Asturias? No, but I'll take care of that! I knew it couldn't be that easy. It is , man. We'll tell 'em our story, they feel sorry for us and take us. So you , who never trusted anyone, think this'll work? I don't rely on train inspectors or taxi drivers, but car sharers are hippies or flower children. They're probably ecologists, volunteers, very giving... and all that crap. Do you know who I don't trust? You . You make me sick with all your lying and conniving... Well don't get sick, I'm not a doctor. And thanks to my lies, we're going to get out of this. So don't complain. You're the one who got us in this mess. You even lie to yourself. You were gonna hook up with that 30-year-old? Please... it's like you don't know your own age. Yeah I do, it's around yours. Excuse me. You're a grandpa. Yeah, because it didn't take me 40 years to get a girl. Maybe I thought a little more about the responsibility of being a parent. Or an absent dad like some. Absent dad? I didn't leave my kid alone on a train heading for Asturias. -Damn, he's mad. -Bah. It'll pass. Felipe? What did I say? Let's go. Hey. Come on in. You're loved here. Come in. Are you comfortable? Yes, thanks. Well, I was kinda uncomfortable that a woman's driving. You've got balls, man! Excuse me. What did you say? I was joking, man. I let them drive too. Now parking's another thing. What're you doing in Leon? -Well... -We're actually going to Asturias. I don't know what we're going to do after Leon with 5 euros left. You're our only hope to be close. Is something wrong? A problem? The train left with our kids in it. They're alone. They get to Asturias in the morning. Poor things! How did that happen? When there were still 10 minutes for the train to leave we got off to help an old woman with her bags. Our train left ahead of time and left us behind. No! We'll take you directly there. We gotta help. Really? Thank you so much! Of course. How many are there? The kids? Three boys and three girls. Equality, above everything. Yeah... We don't say he and she or him and her. We say they. Inclusive language. Of course. They shouldn't be assigned a sex until they decide how they feel. Sure, that too. 'Cause now they can choose. Unreal. -How old are they? -Mine's 8. Well, 8 because he was born 8 years ago. But he should probably choose his age when he grows up. What're you doing here? -Don't be rude. Answer when you're asked. -I'm hunting Pokémons. Hunting? You like hunting? He loves it. You too? That's why you're heading for Leon. Good quail and rabbit there. Don't pay him any mind. The boy's playing a game. Hunting is never a game! We're against hunting as a sport. Of course. Hunting is only for eating. But ham, that's an exception. What're you talking about? Do you know how much a pig suffers? Not half as much as I enjoy eating it. What're you doing? See what I said? You can't let women drive. Out. How're we gonna get outta here? Your friend is about to find out how much a pig suffers. -Outta here! -Get out. We'll come back and get you. No. Everybody out! But he said the pig thing. Out on your ass, now! Lots of love for the animals, no love for the girls and boys. They or them! I can't believe you screwed up again. Why are you mad at me, when it's his fault. I was in the army at your age, not hunting cartoons. Pokémons. Besides, you're the one hunting chicks , and got us in this mess. Eat it! You had it coming. The zinger was his, loser Leave it alone already. I'm running out of power and this guy's is too. Get yourselves decent cell phones. Wait. -Do you guys hear that? -It's a disco beat. Some disco. In the middle of nowhere. -Let's see. -We have to go somewhere. Nice! Let's go in. Sure, we'll dance away the afternoon. We're in no hurry. We're going to ask where the nearest town is. Maybe he'll help us out, and if we're lucky we'll get a ride. -He's drunk as a skunk. -He's soused. High as a kite. Wait... Follow me. -Bingo. -Bingo? What do you mean bingo? Let's go. Come on man, you can't see straight. Let me help you out. Thanks, pal. Are you stealing his car and leaving him out here? No, Ricardo, I have my limits. We're going to take him home. Come on, get him in. -You didn't ask him where he lives. -He can't answer. But he looks like he lives in Asturias. What? This is practically kidnapping. If you like, we'll dump him. How can you be so negative? We probably just saved his life. Lord. At least the kids must be asleep until they get to Asturias. I got them all! I'm the world champ! -No! -Please don't make so much noise, the inspector's gonna catch us. I told you so. Open up, please. 'Evening inspector. Can I help you? I found this extremely hyper girl running down the aisle. Where are your parents? In the compartment next door. I'm going to talk to them. Wait! They're asleep because they had a headache. I'd better go in first and tell them you want to see them. Next stop Conejares, the train will leave in two minutes. Lucas? -Lucas Ferraro Esparza? -Yes, that's me. I have a package for you. Your package, sir. -Here. -Okay. Thank you. STETHOSCOPE Marcos, what's wrong? You okay? It's okay, I didn't want to wake you but the inspector is outside the compartment and wants to talk to you. I told him you were asleep but he insisted. Oh my god. What do we do now? Relax dad, I have an idea. Hey, Hey! Yes? What? Could you come out a minute? Sorry but we're in our pajamas. Sir, your kids are outta control. You can't leave them alone. Okay. I'll take care of it. They won't be bothering you anymore. Okay. Thanks a lot. Good night. Good ni... Damn! The power! Hey! Hey! What did you say? Hasta la vista, baby. Come outta there right now, brat! Do you think I'm an idiot? I know what you're playing at. I saw Home Alone too. Lucas, what're you doing? What're you doing? Go back to your territory, this is mine. You're not the sheriff of this county. These damn kids are alone and they're outta control. Lucas, calm down and stop bothering the passengers. You and I both saw how these gentlemen got on the train. And they're sleeping in a separate compartment without the kids. So they could sleep in peace, so you let them do just that. Lucas, you're imagining things... You're right. It's crazy to bang on the passenger's doors. I'm off. Very well. I'm going to do the rounds here all night until we arrive. And they have to come out. Do whatever you have to do. But I think your therapy ended too soon. Leave me be, I don't need anything from you. Thanks. Well, actually, yes. Can you bring me a double coffee? You're going nuts. It's Marcos! He says he's going to keep watch all night. What should we do? He asked that guy to bring coffee. Let's empty my dad's zipper pouch! The big backpack! I'll get it. Put it here. It's like a piñata! Bingo. What's that? It looks like a balloon. Now you look like a balloon. But it's hard to blow up. What kind of pills are there? There have to be sleeping pills. -What do those look like? -They're usually blue. Laxatives. What're those? No, those're to go to the bathroom! But they can be useful. Take 'em. -Look, here they are. Sleepmore. -Cool. Those are it. You have to mash 'em and put 'em in his coffee. The sleeping or the bathroom ones? Both, just in case. How are we gonna get the pills in the coffee? Jeez, I dunno. Think a little. Do I have to think of everything? Here's your coffee, but I think you should go rest. Can you leave already? Now I really don't need anything. Sure, wait. Did you bring sugar? I'm not moving from here all night. I already neutralized your leader. And you better not try and leave this compartment or I'll lock you in the boiler room. What's a boiler room? A room where they boil people. No way. He's trying to scare us. Modern trains don't have those. But now how do we get the pills in his coffee? What if... Don't even look at Chuspi. What do you wanna do? If we let it loose in the aisle he'd leave the coffee and go after it. What if he catches him? Chuspi probably runs faster than him. Okay, Chuspi, here's the deal: when we let you go in the aisle, run as fast as you can so we can put the pills in the ticket guy's coffee. See, Fernandito? I explained it all perfectly to him. No problem. All right. What the... Now! Go on! I saw you. Come here. Damn bug! Where are you? Come to papa. Lucas... What're you doing, for cripes sake? Didn't you see that? The little monsters let a bug loose. A bug? You're seeing things. Go rest. No way will I go rest. I won't budge from this door all night. Unai, lend me your cellphone right now. I have to call Marcos, an emergency. I'm texting. You took my backpack, so use my charger. There's nowhere to plug it in. What's it to me? Stop arguing, dammit. We're going to wake that guy up. Don't go so fast! You're going to kill us. It's so we get there faster. I'm falling asleep. You're falling asleep and you're driving at this speed? Let me drive. You're sure? You're not sleepy? I can't sleep at all without my pills. Well I need to take a crap. Relax, Unai. Relax ? Gonna take a crap for me? I'd love to, but my laxatives are also on the train. Do you see him? Damn, no sleeping and no taking a crap. Couldn't you knock him out with a karate chop? I'm only a white and yellow belt... 'cause grandpa bribed the instructor. Well we can't do anything to make him go to sleep until the pills start working. But about the laxatives... Diana, we're going to need your makeup kit. Yay! We might as well have fun until he passes out. Don't expect me to do anything. That guy creeps me out. Stop that! You know how to beat your fears? I don't. Make him more scared of you than you are of him. There was a bug, I saw a bug. These kids are diabolical. I'm falling asleep. Damn! What was that? Did we get a flat? It was your snoring. How long have I been asleep? Where are we now? 3 hours, but I don't know exactly where we are. I think I'm lost. since we can't to use the GPS. Don't worry, at the speed you're going... I'm driving at the legal speed. We must have moved some, because we're running low on gas. What? Now we really blew it. Relax, man. We'll see a gas station soon. What does it matter, when we don't have a euro left? We'll do like we always do. We'll fill 'er up and take off. No, not that. Not again. Come on, I'm out of the refill for the inhaler. And I'm crapping myself. Shut up! Three hours you've been saying that. If it were true, you'd have shit yourself already. Don't test me... Unai, please hold on at least until we get to the train. Easy for you to say, you're always constipated. Good! He's out like a light! Time for the second part of our plan. Are you ready? Ready. Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, what're you doing? -Off to bed. -I'm watching out for those maggots. Those... Those... -Monsters. -Pull. Those damn... kids... Come on. Let's go. Damn, what's that smell? Lucas, you shit yourself. What're you saying? Let's go. Brats! He's out like a light, let's go. That's it. Let's go! -Wait. We need to lather. -And shampoo. Diana, what're you doing? Wait, I'm almost finished. What's that for? Nothing, just so he looks better. Come on, that's enough. All done! Come on, let's go. At last, a gas station. Look, at 500 meters, take that exit. When we get to the gas station I'll get out and fill 'er up, and you ride shotgun. And I'll have to drive, 'cause we're going to have to take off. Oh please, forgive us. Oh please? What are you, religious all of a sudden? No man. I mean the guy from the gas station. Come on, get out. Hurry it up. I'm dying here. Relax, man. While we're pumping gas we're not breaking any laws. Enjoy the moment. This is breaking the law. -Wait. Unai isn't back yet. -Then he's stuck here, the slowpoke! What? No! We can't leave him here. Turn around! Turn around! Quick, get in, dummy! Sorry, we'll come back and pay you! -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -Stop, stop! I'm so sorry sir! I'm sorry! Roll up the window, idiot. I can't, I'm going to catch my fingers. I'm really sorry. I assure you I'm going to come pay! Are you an idiot? -Seriously, I plan on coming back. -I was talking to the other idiot. He can't hear anything, he's still asleep. I'm talking to you, dimwit. What were you thinking? I told you I had to take a dump. If I asked you, you wouldn't have let me. Yes! Mission accomplished! Even if he wakes up before we get there, he can't catch us anymore. Can we sleep now? No! Yes, there's no sleeping in the morning. It arrives at the station at 8 o'clock. We have to take off as soon as it stops so we won't get caught. I'm scared again. Relax, Ricardo and my grandpa will be waiting for us when we get there. What if they're not there? Diana, you too? They are going to be there. When has grandpa disappointed us? Can you drive slower? We have to make up for lost time while you were driving. Okay, but slow down, no one's after us. Now they are. Damn, where did they come from? Jeez, stop the car! I can't stop. -Why? -Because I don't have a license. What? Stop the car right now. Okay. But let me talk. Hello. Do you know how fast you were going? Of course. I'm a doctor, and that man is in a coma. I'm driving his car to take him to the hospital. Hey, the stripper's here at last. Put the handcuffs on me, baby. Driver's license. I don't have it. What? No driver's license? I swear your honor, I had no idea. I do have a license, it's just temporarily suspended. But this man is so sick, I felt obliged to get him to a hospital. Sir, whose car is this? A friend's. I took his key so that he wouldn't, because the bastard was drunk as a skunk. So you were looking for the nearest hospital. Yes, yes. Where are you coming from? Leon. But we're in Asturias. Yeah, I'm so glad. We'd gotten lost and didn't know where we were. All of you. Get out of the car. Me too? I haven't done anything. Can't we resolve this amongst ourselves with, let's say... 5 euros. Are you kidding me? We don't mean to offend you, we just don't have any more. Not like that, you put it in the G-string. That's enough. Everyone out, now. Quiet everyone. -My gun. -Olé. What're you doing, Unai? Don't worry, he's a minor and dimwitted, but he's harmless. Come on, your cellphone and gun. On the floor! -What're you saying? -We can't leave them here, they'll call for backup and find us. We're gonna drive 'til we're at least 10 km from your car. We'll drop 'em, where they can't contact anyone. Stop talking nonsense and give the man his gun back. No! Come on! In the car! Quick! Come on! Come on! Damn! A little dimwitted you said? Wow, awkward silence. No one's saying anything. Are you very cramped there? Excuse us, we know we're not supposed to take more than 3 in the back... but under the circumstances... Kid, move over, can't you see there's not enough room? We're not crooks, we have a situation that makes it impossible for us to stop. How did you think of all that? You're a psychopath. No prob. I owe you for coming back when we held up the gas station. What? No, no! We didn't hold anything up. What an imagination! Exaggerations. We just took some gas without paying. You guys came back for me so I had your backs, we're a gang. What're you saying, you nut? We're not a gang. Well, you kidnapped three people that makes you sort of a gang. I'm the brains. You're impressed with my plan, eh? Gimme a recommendation for the force. Hey stripper, take something off, eh? Shut it, kid, show some respect for the Civil Guard. Ricardo, I think we can let them go around here. There isn't a town for a 20 km radius. Come on, please. Okay, okay! Unai, give 'em their guns. Of course, so when we leave they can shoot the tires. Look, if you write down your address, I'll send back your gun tomorrow. I don't know what else I can do. Really, I'm sorry. We'll have to report this, no? Report? Not a word of this to anyone, ever.. Never thought I'd say this... -Well done, kid! -Wait, what? Well done? When they talk to someone we'll have the police after us. They have our tag number. We can't travel in this car anymore. Ricardo, don't flip out. You, dammit, give me that gun. You're too nervous to handle a gun. A gun should always be in an expert's hands. Are you guys okay? What happened? Relax, we're fine. Even this one -has revived. -You almost killed us, dammit! What're we going to do now? This is all we need. Damn, Ricardo. You're never happy. Didn't you just say we had to get rid of this car? No, seriously, what is this? Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. This's one of those interactive games. An escape room. This is a set up done by my friends for my bachelor party. Right? You're recording? What're you saying? Do we look like actors? Yeah, you guys are good, but this one overacts a bit. But it's cool. Go on then, I'm more awake now. Now some help, right? A clue. Let's see if I can find one. Come on, man. Don't be pusillanimous. Show a little character, no wonder your wife's gonna leave you. My wife's not going to leave me. Who told you that? You told me you were having problems, earlier. But relax, you're not going to die from that. No, not from that. But yes, I am going to die. What? Just that, that's the problem, I am dying. I'm sorry. From what I heard, I thought you were separating. Sure, irrevocably. Ricardo... I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I don't know what to say. That's why I organized this long trip with Marcos. To take a trip. A special father and son trip. Something we could remember forever. But people started to tag along. We missed the train. I didn't get to be alone with him nor did I even get to be with him! Even worse we won't get to the station on time. Nothing doing. Relax. I'll do whatever it takes to reunite you and your son. If it's the last thing I do, I swear! Finally. Got you! What? You were faking it? I learned a lot from you on this trip. -Son of a... -Hey! I found it! There're lights from far off. Civilization. What a coincidence, eh? This is fun, come on, let's go. -So, you're not going to die? -No. My wife's going to leave me. She says I can't make decisions, that I fret over everything that I'm pusillanimous. I pretty much agree with your wife. Except for the pusillanimous thing. 'Cause I don't know what it is. Come on guys. Up and at 'em! The train arrives in 20 minutes. We've got to pick this all up to get off as soon as it stops. Come on, Fernandito! Chuspi still isn't back. I'm not leaving without him. Relax, man. Chuspi's smart. He'll probably come back now. But remember what you have to do? Yeah, wait outside the inspector's compartment in case he wakes up before we get there. and if I see that he gets out, I'll run back and tell you. Perfect! Good luck! You really had me there. I really believed you were a goner. Everything rubs off, 'cause damn, you are such a liar. Well I'm not exactly proud of that. You know that kid's game, truth or dare? Yeah, Marcos loves it. Well, I've always been more dare than truth. But the time's come to face some realities. -What? -I also learned things from you. -Really? -You were right about the absent dad. When I see that you like being with your kid. I realize I was never a good father to Clara. -It's never too late. -Now it is, it's very late. -Let's hurry. -Come on, man. This is great, I'm dying to see what happens now. Wow, I'm dizzy. Maybe we shouldn't go through here. It looks like private property, a farmer with a gun may show up. A gun? You've seen too many movies. We're in Asturias, not Oklahoma. Not one more step. What do you want? Manolo, shoot first and ask questions later. This is so cool. Excuse me sir, we had an accident. What're you telling me for? You see ma'am, we need to get to the train station. As soon as possible, our kids are traveling alone, and arrive in 32 minutes. That's your problem. Out! Dear, -they have a serious problem. -Quiet! You want a problem now? I said don't contradict me in public. If you could get us to the station we'll pay you whatever you ask. Let's see your wallets. Our wallets are on the train. We can leave this guy here as a voucher that we'll pay you. I knew it, you're trying to fool us, you're con men. We're calling the police! Take these ropes and tie them until the police come. Dear Madame, this's a misunderstanding. Our situation's dire, we can't... Stay there and don't move! Or I'll shoot. You keep still, lady! You don't know what I'm capable of for my son! Felipe, the rifle. And you tie her up and take us to the station immediately. -Whatever you say, aye, aye.. -Manolo, don't you dare. Manolo, you'll be sorry. Really, I'm sorry, we wouldn't hurt a fly. Speak for yourself. It's all right, don't worry. You don't know what my wife's like. You guys actually made my day. Hey, are you going to take us in a tractor? Don't you have any other vehicle? A van? Where do you think you are, Oklahoma? Don't be fooled by appearances. Come on, get up here, you're gonna love it. You don't know the power these things have. So? This is so cool! 20 minutes until the train arrives! We're not going to make it! You're doing everything you can. You're a good father. Thanks. You're a good kid, too. Without your help we couldn't have gotten here. Here you go. Your backpack, you've won back our trust. Could we go a little faster somehow or take a shortcut? We're not gonna make it! You wanna go fast, eh? If you're not afraid of strong emotions I can make this thing go fast and take a shortcut. Hang on! We just have to get down that hill. The station is 5 minutes from other side. What's this? This is the grand finale! Here's where they give me flowers and all that stuff. Those damn bastards, what a mess they got me in! They're filming a milk ad, they're always doing that here. Halt. Stop, stop! No trespassing, we're filming a commercial. How long are you going to be? We have to get by. Just a minute. One line and we're done. Come on, out everyone.. Out, out, out. Out. Lights. Camera... Action. Milkasgaya milk gives Asturiana milk my daughter, my granddaughter and my sister Hannah. Hey, excuse me... -Cut, cut. -Cut! Wouldn't it be more logical if she was my wife? What? If we're a family unit it makes more sense. My daughter, my granddaughter... shouldn't she be my wife? No, I said it over and over, she has to be your sister Hannah. Your sister Hannah, you understand? So that it rhymes with Asturiana. Okay? So if you don't mind, come on, let's do another take. Action. What if I say, this beautiful cow gives the milk of life, for my daughter, my granddaughter and my lovely wife. That rhymes. Yeah, it rhymes, it rhymes. But you don't say the most important thing in the ad. That it's Asturian milk. What? Come on, action. But the milk is called Milkasgaya, Makes the cows sound Russian, not Asturian. This is unbelievable, damn. There's no other way to get across? We're coming through. Everyone outta the way! Damn! Holy cow! Now we're cooking with gas! Hang on! When we get down there, 5 minutes down that path and you're at the station. 5 minutes, super! 5 minutes at a brisk run, 14 or 15 by tractor. What're you saying? Stop, stop. We'll run from here. The train gets here in 5 minutes. Thank you very much. Here. For your trouble. Thanks, pal. Give my regards to your wife. I'm going to leave her there a while and go get some things done. There's even a race too! This had to be Jordi's idea! Yup. Here I am at my watch. Chuspi! Chuspi, no! Chuspi, no. No, no, no. Come here, Chuspi. Chuspi, Chuspi, no. Guys, he's awake. Crap, he's awake! We still have two minutes until the train arrives and opens. If he gets out, we're busted. Relax, the train is 200 meters long from here to the last car, keeping in mind that our average running speed is 2 meters per second we could reach the last car, eh? 1 minute and 40 seconds. Exactly the time we have left. for the doors to open and get off. That's what Math's good for! We just have to get there without being caught. Of course. Come 'ere, kid! Come here! Come here! Come, you damn kids! Come on, we're going to make it! But will we make it alive? Come on, we're gonna get caught! Excuse me. Take that! And that! -And that one for Chuspi. -And that one. Take that! There! Let's go. Run. Okay, let's do this now. Come on, run! Run fast, let's haul! Thanks! Kids! Dad! We did it! Marcos! Grandpa! Hey, wait! You! You left your kids on the train. What're you talking about? We just got off the train right now with the kids. Look, the authorities are here. Tell them about it. These are the men that abandoned their kids. They put the voyage at risk. Arrest them! What's he talking about? Relax, it's over, it's over. -Come with us. -What? Not me, it's them, those kids, they're delinquents! They faked being other passengers, they let bugs loose on the train! Not me, dammit! Please excuse him, gentlemen he's not well and started back to work too soon. I hope you had a nice, relaxing trip. Smooth sailing, no glitches. Grandpa, we had a great time. And I tried a lot of new things, like you always say. Grandpa, grandpa! I painted my face like a ghost. I'm not afraid of anything anymore! That's great, but you also have to listen to your mom. It's mom. Yes, mom. We just got here. Everything's great. She says she wants to talk to you. Good morning, dear. How did it go? Did you sleep well? Yes, everything's marvelous. Ricardo and I'll be back today, soon as we leave the kids at the camp. I thought maybe tomorrow, you and me could get together. I don't know, go to the movies or to the amusement park... You and me? Without the kids? I owe you a lot of moments from when you were the kid. Dad, I'm very sorry for what I did. You don't know the half of it. We'll have to talk later. At least we were able to keep mom out of it. That's true. Besides, you managed rather well without me. Seriously dad, I really missed you. I'm dying to get back home and catch up on my failing grades. Most of all, Math. What do you mean? Math is cool, dad. We'd have never done it without math. It's true. Or without Chuspi. Okay, kids, the van must be here to get you guys. Yay! Three, four, five and six. -Good job, Felipe. -No, good job you , Ricardo. Wait... -Where's Unai? -Son of a bitch, we lost him. My fault, because I returned his backpack. -I'm here. -You scared the hell out of us. We thought you'd gotten away. No man, we gotta stay together, we're a gang. Besides, maybe this camp isn't as lame as I thought. 'Cause I had a cool time on the trip. Where did you go? I just caught a Charmander. Did you hear that kids? A Charmander. One of the hardest Pokémons to catch. Seriously? You still hunt Pokémons? That's older than my grandma, kid. Don't worry, I like Pokémons too. Where are you going? Come here. Where do you think? To that "camp", right? Where all my friends are, for the grand finale. This was so amazing! Relax, I won't tell them I figured it out from the start. You did it great. Only thing is... you need to go to some acting classes for some gravitas. Thanks a lot, man. Look, you're right. You have caught us. You're a sharp person, but we still have a ways to finish. We're supposed to leave you here at the station, some hooded guys are coming and they'll grab you to take you to the actual party. That's where everyone's waiting. Cool! They're gonna come here? Yeah. You wait there and they'll come. Damn. I hardly recognize you. -I'm missing gravitas, he says. -Shall we go? Yes, yeah. Okay now. Behave. Relax, man. They're in good hands. What would you know about that? What would I know? I'm the camp counselor. You know what? They can handle it. Hey, if you want to meet up in Madrid. Since your wife's going to leave you... About her leaving me,... we'll see. You know, Rick, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. -That's from Casablanca. -Helluva movie. Yeah, but Rick said that. In other words, me. But it sounds better when I say it. -That's so Felipe of you. -That's so Ricardo of you. I know you are, but what am I? Have fun. Sew, sing and laugh, jump and run and also kiss, but your train, do not miss! Hug, swim, hike through Europe and put away your clothes, but don't miss the train stay on your toes! Love, desire, look and find, fight, or turn around and resist, but don't lose your train or your mind. 'Cause it's all for nothing, or nothing for all. And if you manage to catch your train, you'll escape the fall. Neither fire, storm, nor rain, nor wind or dark enemies will keep them out of play or away from the train. Love, desire, look and find, fight, or turn around and resist, but don't lose your train or your mind. If you miss your train, just get back in. As it is in life, you learn to walk in the rain. The thing's to stay strong when you're thrown a curve ball, if you can do that, you can have it all. To have fun and dance, Gotta give it a chance. To be able to dance, to be able to spin, first of all you gotta let it in. Come on dude, get an attitude! Sometimes when things don't go right, and you try to jump the hoops with all your might. Sometimes when things don't go your way, just take a deep breath, and don't let the train get away. Love, desire, look and find, fight, or turn around and resist, but don't lose your train or your mind. 'Cause it's all for nothing, or nothing for all. And if you manage to catch your train, you'll escape the fall. Neither fire, storm, nor rain, nor wind or dark enemies will keep them out of play or away from the train. Yes? Hey jerk, where's my car? That damn Jordi. Where are you guys? I've been waiting for two hours. Come out already, you S.O.B.s! Are you still wasted? Great bachelor party! You guys are the best. What the hell are you talking about? I'm the one getting married. Oh yeah. Damn.
