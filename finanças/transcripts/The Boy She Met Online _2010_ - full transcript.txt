So... what are you gonna say? I don't know. What should I ask him? Mmm... ask him when he's gonna take you out on a real date so that you can finally make out with him. He's hot. I know. Totally telling Dylan you said that... PS. Anyway, seriously, what else do I ask him? Well, it, uh, says here that he plays basketball and soccer, majoring in electrical engineering, um... plays guitar. Oh, ask him if he went to see any good concerts lately. Ooh, brilliant! See, this is why I love you. So been to any good concerts lately? Oh, and ask him about his tattoo. It's a dragon, right? Ooh, good one! Look at you, two in a row! Girls... dinner! Cami? Ooh, my mom, it's my mom! What's going on? Nothing. Mm-hmm. Well, dinner's ready. And, Lindsay, you're welcome to stay if you like. Thanks, but I can't. It's Dylan's mom's big 4-0 and they invited me to go out to eat with them. Oh, that's so nice. Well, tell his mom I say happy birthday. I will. Three minutes? Good night. Okay. Where'd you put it? Okay, he's so hot. I know. Other people are bringing their kids to the company party. Besides, Doug would really like to see you before you go to New York. Are you starving or something? No, I just have a lot of homework to do before I go to bed tonight. I know you're leaving in six months, but Doug would still... Mom, Doug could care less about seeing me; It's you he can't get enough of. Come on, we're just friends. Does he know that? Very funny. Oh! Wait a second. What? You're trying to be all sneaky, but I'm on to you. What? Hmm. I know why you want me to go to that party. It's 'cause that guy's gonna be there, that son of the VP or whatever. Pete? Oh, Pete? I don't know, maybe. Maybe you should call him and find out if he's gonna be there. Um, because then he'd have my cell number. Cami, Pete is a really nice kid. He's got a lot in common with you. Mom, he reads the dictionary on his spare time. The guy's a tool. Cami. Hello? Oh, hi, Kendra. I'm just gonna take this upstairs. Hold on... Cami! Bye. Oh, you're like family, of course you can stay here. Damn. I wish I could find a guy as witty as you. Uh, you've got a guy. Jakester23. Sorry, who's Jakester23? He's the guy Cami met online and he's gorgeous. What, are you desperate? You've sunk to actually going online to find a boyfriend. Whoa, hey, if there were any guys to date in this school, I would, but there aren't. Cami likes older men. Older? Mm-hmm. For all you know, this guy's 50 and bald. We've seen his picture. You've seen a picture. He's 23 and in college. Your mom is never gonna let you date a college guy. Not if she doesn't know about it. Besides, she'll be in college next year, too, and then it won't matter. Mmm, nice logic, Linds! You two scare me. I gotta get to class. Bye, babe. I'll text you after Lit, love you. Love you, too. Love you more. Uh, God, you guys are annoying. Who is that? Oh, she a ten. I know. That's Cami. You know, the chick I've been telling you about? Mm-hmm. We've been e-mailing for a long time now, so... I think I'm gonna step it up and talk to her on the phone. Yeah. You tell her you're getting out in two weeks? No. Come on, she thinks I go to Penn State, not the state pen. I had to tell her I was in college. Great. A girl like this'd never date a con. Hmm. What? You said it yourself, man. She is a ten! What's gonna happen when you actually meet her? You know what I'm saying, man? College boys don't have appointments with parole officers, man. It's a waste of time. No, it isn't. And it doesn't matter, anyway. It's like I said, when I get out, things are gonna be different for me. Amen to that. Cami, is that a cell phone? You know the rules about cell phones. You can have it back at the end of the day. I wasn't texting. I don't care. Thank you. Okay, everybody, back to work. So who were you texting in class? I told you, I wasn't texting. I was checking my e-mail. That is not the point. When you're in class, you're supposed to be paying attention. I do! I'm getting an "A"! It's disrespectful to your teacher. I mean, look, when I'm in a staff meeting, I don't sit there e-mailing while my boss is talking. Hi. Kendra, come on in. Hi. Hi, Cam. Hey. Did I come at a bad time? Oh, no. We're thrilled to have you. Cami and I were just having a little discussion. Uh, honey, why don't you help Kendra with her baggage and I'll just check on dinner. Sure. I'll take that. I better get started on my homework. Wouldn't want Linsky to think I don't take her class seriously. I'm guessing that has something to do with what I walked in on tonight. I don't know what it is with her. She's 17. It's normal for her to pull away and want to become independent. I know and I want to encourage that. But I also want her to be able to talk to me. I don't know, something's going on with her and I can't figure it out. It's been happening for a couple of weeks. What do you mean? You know when you're the only one in the room who just doesn't get the joke? Tori, it's normal. I mean, did you really tell your mother everything? 'Cause I sure didn't. No. But my mother wasn't as understanding as I am. Jake, listen. Mom said you can't live with her this time. What? She's done. What am I supposed to do when I get out? Where am I supposed to go after they release me? Are you kidding me? I can't. I wish I could. What do you mean, you... you can't? I'm your brother! Look... you know I want to help. I really do. Dave doesn't think it's a good idea. Dave. I've got the kids staying with us now. We're trying to get custody. It'll just really complicate things. I'm ready to go. You've already made up your mind, so has Mom, and if nobody's gonna be there for me, well, that's just fine. I don't need you. Or her. Or anybody! Hey, man, don't worry about it. Your mom will change her mind. Just show up at her front door. It's nothing. No. Forget her and my sister. I've already got something better worked out anyway, with Edgar. He's been more like family to me my whole life anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember him. He came to visit you once, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Man, we had some wild times, me and him. And he always had my back, so I have nothing to worry about. Why are you so fixated on that thing? I'm not. Wait! He's gonna call you. He said he's gonna try and call. Is this that college clown again? Hey. Ten bucks says he forgets. Why would you say that? Because you met him online. He's probably telling 30 girls he'll call just so he can get some cheap thrill from knowing they're waiting by the phone. Well, I'm not waiting by the phone. What? I'm eating. Ooh! That's probably him! Hello? Will you accept a collect call from... Jake.Yes. Cami? Yeah, hi. Hi. Uh, I'm really sorry to call you collect. My cell phone died, so I'm just at a pay phone. Oh, that's okay, I'm just glad you called. How are you? Me? I'm okay, I guess. Just okay? Yeah, I got some bad news today. Oh, what kind of bad news? It's nothing, really. I'm actually feeling... much better now that I'm talking to you. I have that effect on people. Oh, is that so? What's going on? It sounds like you're at a party or something. No, um... Just at a bar off-campus with some guy friends, and I thought I'd take a minute and call you. Well, I can call you back later tonight if you want. Actually, that's also no. Um... I've got a ball game. Basketball... game. Oh. Yeah, but I have some time in between classes tomorrow, if you can get online and chat maybe around, say, 2:00? Um... sure. Two minutes, let's go. Listen, I gotta run, Princess. Uh, can I call you that? Um, sure. What do I call you? Why don't you think about it? Byers, let's go! Later. Bye. So? So... he's at a bar with some of his friends, and took some time out to call me. How thoughtful. Shh, I want to hear this. And he called me "Princess." Really? That's so cute. I know! It's cheesy! He's a cheese ball. No, he's not. So when are you gonna meet him face to face? I don't know! Soon, I hope. Listen, I gotta run, Princess. Uh, can I call you that? Um, sure. What do I call you? Why don't you think about it? Um, Cami asked me to give this to you. She had to leave early. Thanks. Come on, bro, I need to use it. I'm already ten minutes late. All right, just wait one minute. I just need to send this e-mail. No, seriously, just... get up! I was supposed to be online at 2:00, okay? You're gonna see her on Friday when you get out, right? Yes. So relax. My brother's wife just had a baby, man. "Congratulations" is spelled with a "D" or a "T"? Neither. 'Cause I just deleted it. Really? Byers, Jackson, back to your cell now! So what'd he say? Nothing. He wasn't online. I hope he still wants to meet up next week. I hope he's as hot in person as he is in his pic. Cami, what are you doing here? Oh, my God. Do you remember? Yeah. Really twisted. I know. Oh, hi, sweetie. How was your day? Crappy. I got detention for giving Ms. Linsky a fake note to get out of class. What do you mean "a fake note"? I forged your signature. You forged my signature. And where did you go that was more important than school? To the mall. You went to the mall... You skipped school to go shopping? There's this really great scarf that I wanted and today was the last day of the sale, so I... And where is this incredibly important scarf? They were sold out. They were, honestly! Cami, this is not okay. You are just a couple months from graduating with honors and you can't start screwing it up now. I know, I know! It was a bad idea, okay, it was stupid. You don't know, obviously. Whatever, Mom. Do you care if I go talk to her? No, talk away... talk away. She obviously doesn't listen to me. Hey. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. I know she's mad. I just can't wait 'til I turn 18 and I can do whatever I want and no one can say anything about it. Oh, I hate to break it to you, but things don't change just because you turn 18. Your mom's still gonna be your mom and she's still gonna want you to make the right decisions and be upset with you when you don't. But at some point, I have to be able to live my own life. Mm-hmm. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. You need to make your own decisions. But let me just say this. There are some mistakes that are the kind that you can learn from and there are some mistakes that are the kind that can change your whole life. Your mom's the one who can help you tell the difference. It's so hard. I know, I know. Thank you. Yeah. You know where to find me when you get out, right? Haven't we seen each other long enough? Take care of yourself. You too. Hey, what are you willing to do for a ride? What happened, man? You were supposed to be here like two hours ago. My apologies. Hop in. Nice ride. What's this all about? Just a little something I'm working on. Welcome back, man. Thanks. Yes! Thanks, Linds, this is perfect. I promise I won't spill anything on it. So what's the story? You're coming over to my house to study? No, actually, my mom's going out for dinner with a friend, so it shouldn't even come up. Well, if it does, I've got your back. Nice! Thanks, babe! Okay, I'll see you in sixth. Oh, look at you. All spiffy in the new shirt from your sugar daddy. Yeah, man, it's... It's pretty good. Thank you. I really appreciate it. And I am on the job and the apartment thing, so you're not gonna be supporting me for very long. You got that right, gold digger. You know, if it becomes a problem, I can always go and stay in my step-dad's cabin. What, that place we used to go as kids out in the boonies? No, get real. Here, it's a Jimmy parked out front. You sure your friend won't mind? No, not at all. He's not gonna be back 'til next month. And he owes me money, anyway. Good. Oh, hey. Hey. You going out? Yeah, just to Lindsay's to study. Oh, okay. Great, see ya. See ya. Hey. Hi. You know, you're even prettier in person. Thanks. So are you. I mean, better-looking. What are you drinking? Oh, it's just a coffee. Do you like coffee? Do you... I can get you one. Yeah, sure, thanks. Actually, a Mochaccino. A what? A Mochaccino. Okay. Thanks. So what are you gonna do when you graduate? Ever since I was little, I always wanted to be a veterinarian. I just really like being around animals, you know? Is that stupid? No, not at all. Were you one of those little girls that always wanted a pony for Christmas but never got it? How did you know? I don't know, you just seem like that kind of girl. Do you want to... do you want to just take these, maybe, and, I don't know, go for a drive or something? Yeah, sure. Cool. Wait. Okay, ready? Yeah. We look pretty good together. We do. You especially. That's because you're standing next to me. Oh, good one. So is your mom as ridiculously overprotective as mine? It's just the opposite. I don't think she cares if I live or die. Really? Yeah, I'm serious. I'm only close to one person in my family now, my sister Celeste, but not even her so much anymore. Why not? How's... how's your dad? Is he as strict as your mom? Um, my dad died in a motorcycle accident about three years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. My parents divorced when I was about 12, then after my dad left, I stopped talking to him. He called every Saturday and left me a message and I never called him back. Then one Saturday, it wasn't him calling, it was the highway patrol. I saved his last message. I didn't listen to it ever, I just wanted to keep it. You know, I lost my dad, too. But I was so young, I don't even remember him, just that he was killed by one of my uncle's friends. Your dad was murdered? Yeah, in a business deal gone bad or something. Like I said, I don't know. Celeste does. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I don't really tell anybody this stuff about my dad. Well, that must mean I'm special. You are special. That wasn't a very good kiss. You might want to try that again. Let's see if I can get it right. Hey. Oh, hey. How was dinner with your friend? It was good. Did Cami go out? 'Cause I didn't see her car. Yeah, actually, she said she was going over to Lindsay's to study. Oh, okay. Good night. Hey. Where were you tonight? Kendra didn't tell you? Lindsay and I were studying. It's after 11:00. I don't want to do this right now. I'm sorry, but I'm your mother and I have a right to know where you were. I told you where I was. Stop scrutinizing everything I do. Cami... I've had it, okay? I'm gonna have to start taking away privileges. Give me your phone. What? No, I need my phone. And I need you to start being honest and follow the rules of this house, and when you do that, you can get your phone back. You can't take my phone away. I can take your phone away. And you'll get it back when you tell me where you were tonight. I don't have to tell you anything. Cami, give me your phone. I hate you. Hey. You think I can borrow some cash, man? Oh, sure. How much? Like 200 bucks? You know I'll pay you back as soon as I find some work. You see all this cash, man? I didn't make it clocking in and out five days a week. Thanks. I'm good for it. I know. I know, I'm excited, too. What do you guys feel like eating? Burgers? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Cool. So... So save you guys seats? Yes. Okay, thanks. Bye. Hi. Hi. Princess. Yes. I have a surprise for you. Okay. You got me a phone? Yep. I can't have my girlfriend driving around without a phone. It's not safe. Your girlfriend? Did I say "girlfriend"? 'Cause I probably meant to say "booty call." Oh. Um, so my friends invited us out for lunch. You wanna go? Well, actually, I was kind of hoping we could hang out, just the two of us. Uh, yeah, okay, I'm just gonna call them so they don't wait. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. See? It does that every time I log on. Okay, okay. Well, let me see what you've been browsing to. You know, maybe you picked up a virus or something. You did a search on "My Teenage Daughter Is Out Of Control"? More than 2 million hits. I guess a lot of people have out-of-control daughters. Yeah. Well, I did what you advised and I got tough. I took away her cell phone. Good. How'd that go over? How do you think? No, no, this is good. Listen, you cut off the supply line and the enemy starves, all right? What is it with you and war analogies? I don't know. It's too much "Call of Duty" or something. Yeah, I'd say so. What is that, like, a $200 suit? No, that is a $100 suit. The other 100 went to Cami's phone. Oh, you're whipped. Whatever, man. Now, the book said to dress for the job and I think this suit says "senior management." After your extended vacation at Club Fed? I wouldn't hire you to walk my dog. Listen, I need someone to make a couple of deliveries for me tomorrow. If you can find time in your busy schedule, you can forget the two Bennies you owe me. What did I tell you, man? You'll get your money. Unbelievable. You make one stupid little mistake and then your whole... What? Hey. What's going on? Hey. Don't you have class? Yeah... no. I didn't go. I just wanted to see you. Did something happen? No. I know you didn't come all the way down here just to watch me bus tables. What's going on? Come on, sit down. I went out to interview for a job today. A really good job. I... I didn't get it. Is that it? It's not enough? Well, I mean, it's not the end of the world. There's tons of jobs out there for electrical engineers. It's not that easy, Cam. It is that easy. You're gonna graduate with a great degree from a great school. And you're smart. People always love hiring the brightest of the bunch. Cami, you have no idea what you're talking about right now, so you can just stop. Okay. Cami. I'm sorry, okay? I'm just really, y'know, frustrated right now. I'm out here and I'm trying to do things... right, you know? Sometimes you have to go on five or ten interviews before you get the job. I mean, it's not that easy, it's just the way it is. I was really lucky to get hired on my first try. Yeah, but, Cami, you don't really understand everything. What don't I understand? Well, you'll see for yourself when you graduate. You know, it's tough out there. Don't get discouraged. Good things are gonna come your way. You'll see. Now, tell me, is that something you're saying just to make me feel better or do you actually believe that? I actually believe that. When do you get off? It's pretty slow. I'll see if Randy'll let me off early. Okay. It's almost 7:00, I should probably go. My mom kind of freaks out when it gets late and she doesn't know where I am. You know you're 18. You can do anything you want. I should probably tell you something. I'm actually 17. You have to be at least 18 to go on the site, so I kind of lied a little. I'm gonna be 18 in a month. I'm really sorry. Are you mad? No. I mean, how could I be mad? I'm... You're what? I haven't been really honest with you, either. You haven't? How do I say this? I haven't really been in college for the last four years. Where were you? For two... I was in prison. I just got out two weeks ago. Just let me explain, okay? I was completely innocent... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute, so every time that you said that you were in class, you were actually... In my cell. Oh, my God! Wait! How can you lie about that? Hey, you lied, too, right? Just give me a chance to explain myself. See, my... my ex was the most evil person on the planet. The store where she worked got... got robbed right after we broke up, and a couple of guys, you know, they went in there with masks and guns and... beat the owner. I don't know, because I wasn't even there. She just said I was, completely fabricated the whole thing. They gave me this idiot lawyer, who... I wasn't gonna win no matter what I did. I had no choice but to plead guilty and I got three years. And then when I was there, my mom basically disowned me. I thought my life was completely ruined until I met you. Do you understand? The first time I saw your face on that stupid site, that's when I knew that there were still good people out there. I had this feeling. When I got out, things were gonna get better for me. 'Cause I'm not a bad person, Cam. I'm just not. And now I'm... I'm kind of stuck, because people just... I need them to see something different than what they do and I actually want to be different. Why didn't you just tell me? I would have understood. Oh, come on. I didn't know you the way I know you now. If you knew the truth, you wouldn't want anything to do with me. Now that I know that I can be totally honest with you, I mean... I will be and I wanted to be. Please, Princess. I'm never gonna lie to you again ever, I swear. I'll never lie to you, either. Do you think maybe she's into drugs? I mean, studying 'til 11:00. I know she lied about that and the mall. Cami's not into drugs. She's got way too good a head on her shoulders. Well, I did look through her phone and I found this number... You looked through her phone? What? I'm her mother, I have that right. As I was saying, I looked through her phone and I saw a name I didn't recognize. Jake. Now, everyone else in there are friends that I know but Jake. Maybe she's been seeing him and that's who she was with last night. Tori... I know this is none of my business, but I really feel she'll be more likely to share stuff with you if you just let up on her a bit. If you really think a teen girl is gonna tell her mother everything, plan to be disappointed. Already? I told you sex is addictive. What? Who the hell is this? This is Cami's mother. Who are you? Look, you gotta calm down. I was only kidding around. I'm one of her... What's your last name, Jake? Damn it. Man, everything sucks. Cami's mom just called and I made some stupid sex joke to her. No, that's not funny. I can't get a job to save my life. I mean, I'm not bondable now because of my felony? What was the point of even getting my license in prison if nobody's gonna hire me? Okay, you know what, man? Forget you. Forget me? I'm the only one who gives a crap. Now, I've been telling you the same thing over and over, but you won't listen. Tell me what? This stupid pipe dream of yours. Get a job, get married to some doe-eyed little girl from the suburbs. Be a dad... all that crap. It's not in the cards for you. It's not you. Jake, did you have any thought you were gonna walk out of prison and someone's gonna hand you a job? Or some lady's gonna want her rich little daughter to pop out a few kids with you? You wouldn't be happy with that life, anyways. That is not true. I've made some mistakes in the past, but this is... The only mistake you made was going with those guys to rob that store. Now, that was stupid. And for what? Less than a grand. I told you not to do it. Look, I know. I know it was stupid, but I let them talk me into it and I did it. So you got busted. Big deal. You served your time. It doesn't mean you change who you are and become some 9:00-to-5:00 drone busting his butt for taxes and union wages. Fine. Then what do I do? You do what you gotta do to survive. It's just like the rest of us. Cami. Where did you get that? Are you sleeping with him? That is none of your business. I can't believe you went in my room, Mom! I hate you! I'm tired of this! Cami. Cami! Cami... what are you doing? I'm leaving. You treat me like a child and you go through my stuff. I can't live in this prison anymore. You always think that you know better than me. How I should spend my money, how I... how much time I need to spend studying, who I need to date. You don't, okay? You don't know better than me. I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself and making my own decisions whether you like it or not. Cami, just calm... Don't, Mom. I need to be with somebody who loves me and who needs me, and that's Jake. He actually... He actually wants to hear what I have to say about stuff. You don't. You never ask what I want or what I think or need or anything. Cami. I love you. And I do care about how you feel. I've been thinking a lot about this lately. A parent always worries about whether their child is happy or safe or feels love. You don't have to worry about all that stuff. I can take care of myself. I want to believe that, honey. And what's happened to us? Why all the secrets, sweetie? Is it because you don't trust me? No, I trust you. Do you think I wouldn't approve of Jake? I don't think you understand him like I do. We just have a connection. It's hard to explain. What's his last name? Byers. Tell me what you like about this Jake Byers. I don't know. He's smart and fun and... he has this depth about him that I've never seen in anyone before. We just get each other. Is he in school? Milford State College. He's... he's gonna be an electrical engineer. How old is he? 19. So he's a freshman. Is that why you didn't want to tell me about him? 'Cause he's in college? Mom, when I go away to New York, I'm gonna come back. You know, it's not like I'm gonna be gone forever. I know. I'm gonna miss you. A lot. I know. I'm taking an early flight to Boston tomorrow and I'll be gone for two days, but maybe when I get back from this conference, I can take you and Jake out to dinner. Sure. I'd like to get to know him. Okay. You here for Edgar? I could have come by to pick it up. Yeah, well, Edgar don't like people coming over his place. What's your name? How come I haven't seen you around before? It doesn't matter, man. You're never gonna see me again. I want to tell her, I just... I don't think she's gonna get past the fact that he was in jail, right? Forget your mother. Jake spent two years in prison. Okay, you're missing the point. At some point, I'm gonna have to introduce them, especially if Jake and I are gonna be together long-term. No, I think you're on crack right now. How can you even think about long-term with a guy who's an ex-con? I mean, I know he's cute, Cami, but seriously, what are you doing with him? Okay, you liked him a month ago. Yeah, well, that was before I found out he lied to my best friend. You know, of all the people, I thought that you'd be a little more understanding. What is there to understand? Would you want me to stay with Dylan if he robbed a store? Shh! He didn't rob anything, okay? I told you that... He had a bad lawyer. And now I know exactly what he's up against. No one's gonna give him a second chance and it's not fair, Linds. Well, Cam, he lied to you over and over. That whole big story about him being in college and... You know what, you know what, never mind. Just let it go, forget it. No, listen to me. Why do you want to be with a guy... Because I love him, Linds. I love him, and I'm... I wanted you to be happy and I thought that you would be happy for me and a little more understanding. And I guess I was wrong, all right? Freeze, police! They actually let you out, bro. They let you out, so you know the standards are low. Good, you haven't changed at all. This is my spot, you want to come in? Cool. It's nice to see you in something besides blue, man. Where you staying? Here, if I can. You think your boy will be down with it? Edgar's cool. Probably. Well, bro, it's good to be back in business. That's for sure. Yeah. Hi. Hey! Guess what? I talked to Randy about getting you a job here and he said you just gotta fill out an application. I know, so good... I'm gonna go get you one. Oh, hey, let's do it later. See, I told Dewayne we'd swing by the place and pick him up. Dewayne your cellmate? He's out? Yeah. Now, listen, I told him I'd buy him a nice dinner to celebrate, but I figured you'd get a little jealous if I didn't get you one too, so can you come and... Is your mom gonna get mad? I can come. My mom's in Boston for a meeting. Yes! I know. Let's go meet Randy, though, first. Let's do it next time. I promise. Let's go, let's go. Okay, okay, I just... I gotta change. Yeah. Just wait here, I'll go get him. I just want to wash my hands quickly. They're still kinda gross from work. Do it at the restaurant. Okay. Yeah, but how do we know we can trust these guys if... I... I told you to wait. That's fine, that's fine. Y'all sound like an old married couple, for real. I'm Dewayne. Hey. You much prettier in person. Thanks. Hey, come on, hurry up. We gotta go. Okay. Okay, I'm telling you guys, this is a bad idea. This coming from the guy who just made 200 bucks this afternoon. It's a couple of runs, man, no biggie. Dewayne's a big boy. Make his own decisions. Whatever you do, this does not come up at dinner. Of course not. All right, let's roll. I've heard of this really great burger place if you want to check it out. Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do it. Okay. Pretty good, huh? Yeah, actually, it's really good. Cami? Kendra? Well, hi. Hey. Um, this is Jake. Hi. And Dewayne. How you doing? Well. I thought I'd try one of these burgers and see if they were as good as you said they were. Oh, good, good. Well, I'll see you back at the house, all right? Okay. Um, Kendra, can you not tell my mom that you saw me here? I just... I kind of told her I was working late. All right. Okay. So I was thinking, maybe you guys could come to New York with me. Instead of staying on campus, we could get a two-bedroom apartment, you guys could get jobs... Cami, neither one of us can move out of the state. On parole. Oh, I thought when you're out, you were done. Nope. I only did two years of a three-year sentence, which means I'm stuck here another 12 months. But you could postpone if you wanted for a year. I know this dude who once postponed his college. What's it called when you do that? Deferring. Yes, yes. You defer it. And then we can get a place here, you could still take classes and stuff in the meantime. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Uh, yeah. Why don't you go ahead, man? I'm just gonna take Cami to her car. All right. Nice meeting you, sweetheart. You too. Bye! You know, something you said today really bothered me. It's... that whole thing about you going to New York. Listen to me. I don't want to go without you, okay, so don't worry about it. We're just gonna wait... A year is not a big deal. Is it? I'm not gonna be unhappy. I'm telling you, I want to stay. What about your... Stay in the car! Dewayne! Oh, no. Okay, come on, buddy. Come on. Come on. We gotta get you to the hospital. Okay, I'll go get help! No! Listen. Can you hear me, man, yeah? Okay, you're gonna go in there and they're gonna help you. You're gonna walk in. By himself? Yeah, by himself, Cam. Okay? You just tell them you were alone and you got jumped in the street. You were alone. What the hell? We can't just leave him! We have to, Cam. Otherwise, we both go back to prison. What do you mean? It's a parole violation just for the two of us to be in the car together. Look, anyway, they got him. Yeah. He's gonna be fine, he's gonna be fine. He's gonna be just fine. Cami. Where were you? What happened? Were you crying? No! No, no, no, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, I just... I'm really tired. Okay. I wanted to talk to you about that guy Dewayne that was with you. Do you mind if we talk about that tomorrow? I'm just not feeling very well and I'm just really tired and... Yeah, okay, sure. Okay, thanks. Good night. You're sure it was Vinny? Yes! I saw him run right out in front of me. If I don't come up with five grand cash by tomorrow night, I'm screwed. So let's go and get it! I'm gonna kill that guy, anyway. Go where, Jake? We ain't gonna find him. Make some calls. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? You look like complete hell. Thanks. No, I just... mean you look like hell. Look, I don't have time to banter with you right now, okay, so just leave me alone, please. No, if you're still mad at Lindsay because of what she said... I'm not mad at anyone! I just have more important things on my mind than Lindsay and school. You do not deserve this. You know, you're my best friend, man. And who would have thought that? You know, the day they stuck you in my cell, it was all I could do to just not beat the crap out of you, you know? You and that smart-ass mouth of yours. Me and Edgar, man... ...we're gonna get the guy that did this to you. I promise. Kendra? Hey. Hi! You're back early. Oh, yeah, I decided not to stay for the dinner. I wanted to make sure everything was okay here at home. So they turned your water back on, huh? Yeah, yeah, they called this morning. Great. How'd everything go with Cami? Well... What? I... I think we should talk. What is this? It's a gang tattoo. The numbers represent the area code where they're from. The article said that they often get them in prison... to show the other inmates which gang they're affiliated with. And his friend had this tattoo? You sure? Mm-hmm. Tori, I don't think either of these guys is in college and they certainly don't look 19. How old do you think they are? Early to mid-20s. They just sort of had this swagger to them that didn't exactly say "electrical engineers She lied again.making." You know what? My boyfriend's brother's a cop, gang task force. I'm gonna call him and see if he can look up any information on Cami's new beau. Did she ever tell you Jake's last name? Byers. Hello? Yeah. Thanks for letting me know. No... From equation seven, we know that "Z" equals one and substitute for one for "Z" in equation five and two. Thus, you'll get "Y" equals one. Finally, the substitute for one for "Z" and for "Y" in the equation two and three. Thus the solution for the system is... This method is sometimes called... In summary, to solve the linear system is... Cami? This method is... Jake? Are you in school? Yeah, what's going on, what happened? I just got a call from Dewayne's brother. He's dead, Cam. Dewayne's gone. Oh, my God. Hello? Yeah, this is she. What? She just got up and walked out of cl... Why? Okay, thank you. Yeah, I'll try and find her. Oh, great. I have her phone. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Let's go upstairs. He assaulted a man during a robbery? Served 2½ years of his three-year sentence. Look, unless you send him back to prison, there's no way my daughter's gonna stop seeing him. Ms. Winters, I can't do that unless he commits some sort of crime. Well, isn't it a crime to be sleeping with a 17-year-old girl? Not when the age of consent is 16. Officer Higgins, Mary's still waiting on Lou's profile. I'll be right there. I'm sorry, just give me one minute. Bad stuff just keeps happening to me. That's not true. Yes, it is. It's like no matter what I try to do, nothing ever works out the way I want it to. When you start to talk about the future, everything just goes to hell. I knew when we started talking about getting a place together, the three of us... something bad would happen. Babe, you can't think like that. You're just really upset right now. You're gonna leave me. What? No, I'll never leave you. I love you. It's only a matter of time 'til you go away, too. Why do you keep saying this? Listen to me. I love you more than anything and I know everyone in your life keeps letting you down, but I'm not gonna be one of them, ever, okay? Oh, Doug, I've been looking for you. Listen, I can't find Cami. The school called and said she just left. I think she might be with this guy that she's been seeing, and I saw his parole officer's file and... Parole officer, I... It's a long story. Anyway, it says he's living with his sister. This is her name and her brother is Jake Byers. Can you get her number or her address or something? I don't know, just... work your IT magic. Wait a second, I thought you had his number. Didn't you talk to him on the phone once? Yeah, I've tried calling him but he's not picking up. Okay, okay, all right. Just sit tight and let me see what I can do, okay? Thanks. Okay. I found two addresses. The second one here, it seems to be the most current. Oh, she lives in Philadelphia. Yeah, they're both local, but just out on the edge of the city. This one has a phone number. Oh, great, thank you, Doug. I owe you one. I'll remember that. Go get washed up for supper. Hello? Um, is this Celeste? Depends on who's calling. My name is Tori Winters. I wanted to speak with you about your brother, Jake. Did he list me as a reference or something? Not exactly. I was hoping you could tell me where he is. I have no idea. He's not living with you? Who is this? Tori, Tori Winters. And your brother is dating my 17-year-old daughter. Look, I don't know where he is and I can't help you. Good luck, though. Hey, that's Mike. Hey. You found him. Vinny? Okay, got it. Mike spotted him going into that pool hall on 37th and Willow. Let's go. What are you guys doing? Stay here. Stay here? Why? Are you going after that guy? Stay here, Cami! Jake, what are you doing? Jake, seriously, don't do this. I have to. No, you don't. Yes, I do. If I don't go down there right now, I'm never gonna get another chance to get this guy. Just... just listen, okay? Just listen to me. This is not what you want to do. This is what the old Jake would do, not the new one. Please. I mean, if you go out there and you get caught, you're gonna go back to jail. I told you earlier that I would never leave you. Please don't leave me. Please, please don't leave me. This guy killed Dewayne. I have to. Okay. That's him. Hey! Remember me, man? Hmm? Huh, where's my money? Where is it? Wallet. Jake! God, what did you do? Let's get out of here! What are you... What are you gonna do... Just shut that bitch up, man! She saw everything! Just let me take care of it. I'll go talk to her. She'll go straight to the cops. You mark my words, Jake. She won't. Well, she better not. If it comes down to us or her, you know the decision I'm gonna make. He... he killed someone. How do you kill someone? Shh. Just calm down. How am I supposed to calm down? Someone's dead. You know we can't talk about this here. We have to go someplace else, okay? Do you trust me? Mm-hmm. There's a ledge here. I think we can climb down. I just haven't been out there in a while. Are you in some kind of trouble again? No, can you just tell me if mom and Ben are up at the cabin, please?! They won't be back up there 'til next month. But I want to know what's going on. Is the key still hidden in the same place? Are the police gonna come looking for you again? Celeste, where is the key?! Same place. I'm gonna call you later and I'm gonna explain everything. Where are we? Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. This is it? Yeah. I just have to go get the key. I'll be right back. It's gonna be okay. Hi. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm the person who called you before. My name is Tori Winters. I'm just really worried about my daughter. She's just 17 years old and she's been dating your brother, Jake. I need to talk to you. So how did your daughter meet Jake? Um, online. From the date on his profile, I think they started e-mailing back and forth when he was still in prison. Please, sit down. Do you know where he is? He gave his parole officer this address, so I thought that may... That's my youngest. I don't know where Jake is. He wanted to live with me, but I told him no. I just try to stay out of it entirely. Please. You don't understand. Ever since Cami met Jake, it's like I've seen her change, she's become a different person. And today she just walked out of class and no one knows where she is. I'm really, really worried. Your daughter's only 17. That's right. Please. If you know where they are, tell me. You're a mother, right? So you know how hard it is to wonder where your child is. Well... he did call me. I asked him what was going on, but he wouldn't tell me. He... he was asking about our stepfather's cabin. Cabin? Where? It's up by Springton Reservoir. Can you give me the address? It's not that far from here. Good. It's gonna take a while to heat up. Jake, can you please tell me what we're doing here? We need to get away from Edgar. What does that mean? I just want to call my mom. I know you do, Princess. God, this situation is so messed up. I got you into this and now I don't even know how to get you out. You would have been better off if you'd never even met me. Please just let me call my mom. Hello? Mom? Oh, Cami. Where are you? I'm with Jake, we're at his step-dad's cabin. Are you okay, are you hurt? No, we're okay. I'm not hurt. Mom, some really bad stuff's happened. I just want you to come get me. Sweetie, I'm on my way. I spoke with Jake's sister and she told me where you are. Okay, okay, I'll see you soon. All right, sweetie. You know, you're gonna be fine. I'm gonna stay here until your mom gets in, and then after I leave, you can call the police or do whatever it is that you have to do. Where are you gonna go? I don't know. But I have to. It's my only chance to stay out of prison. Jake, you can't spend your whole life hiding. It's obviously the only life I can have, Cam. I want you to know that I love you. I really do. Even though I screwed up over and over, you were the only person that ever gave me a chance. Don't cry. Stop. I can't stand it when you cry. Promise me... you're gonna go to New York, you're gonna finish college and do all those great things you always wanted to do, okay? You're still cold. Ben keeps some wood in the shed out back, so let's go see if I can find the key. Cami! Mom! Oh! I was so worried about you. Oh. You must be Jake. I... I gotta go. Wait! I'm sorry for everything, Cam. You call the police. You cooperate with them and you don't worry about me, okay? Oh, Mom! Shut up! Who is this? The mom. Oh, you got a little reunion going on here, eh, Jake? I was just on my way over to you. Like hell you were. The least you could do is just put the gun down, buddy. Sorry, man, can't do that. If you let them go, we can talk about what we're gonna do. What we're gonna do? And what is that, Jake, hmm? Tell me how you think we're gonna let them go and not go to prison. They're not even a part of this. This is our problem, man. You and me, we gotta find a way to fix it. She is the problem, bro. She is the problem. She witnessed the whole thing. Without her, they've got nothing on either one of us and there is no way they're gonna stay quiet now. We won't say anything, I swear. Shut up. Hey, Eddie. Eddie, man, we're gonna go outside, we're gonna get in the car and you and me, we're gonna go to Mexico. Look, I'll give you my phone. That way you know I won't call anybody. She's right. No, she's not. Mom! Eddie? Cami, call an ambulance. Hi, hi, please, we need some help. Two people have been shot. Yeah, we're at a cab... Where are we? 27 Beach Road. 27 Beach Road. Yes, please hurry. Okay. Mom, are you okay? Never thought I'd see you again. I just wanted to say bye. I leave for New York in a couple days. You're gonna do really great in school, Cam. I know it. Thanks. How's your mom doing? She's done all her physio, she's doing a lot better. That's nice. So... So I guess this is it. Take care of yourself, 'Kay? You too. Okay, Linds, I'll see you in a couple hours. Tell Dylan not to make you late. Okay, bye. Ta-da! Oh! I'm gonna miss you. Oh. It's not like I'm going anywhere. You can come home whenever you want. You're not gonna turn my room into a yoga studio or something, are you? Hmm, that's not a bad idea. Mom! Just kidding. Hello! Kendra, I thought you were in Vail! I may have said I left yesterday, but actually, I'm not going until tomorrow. I didn't want to miss your good-bye party. Here, I got you something. Ha-ha! That's awesome.
