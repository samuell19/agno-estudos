(gun shot) (groovy music) (gun fire) - [Narrator] Blue Demon in The Night of Murder. (groovy music) (gun fire) (groovy music) (women chattering) - And now they're asking for their jewelry. - I bet it was Dr. Aruti. She spends her days wondering if her jewels are in a safe place. - You lose. She Dr. Fernandez's wife and she does have a fortune in jewelry. - For the price her husband charges for an operation, I could actually buy two white rhinos each week. - Bellboy! - [Bellboy] Yes, sir. - Take this immediately to Mrs. Fernandez and have her sign the receipt. - Mm-hmm. - Mr. Penas. - [Mr. Penas] Yes, sir. - Please do not let this package out of your sight until it has been delivered safely. - [Mr. Penas] As you say, sir. - Thank you. (groovy music) - Gentlemen. - Hi, there. I didn't know you were staying in this hotel, sir. - I just got here and actually was looking for you. - Why? - Because it's unusual to find a dead body in the room. - A dead body? - Yes, come with me. (groovy music) - Where is it? - Right there. (man grunting) Give me the jewels. If you say anything about me, I will hunt you down and kill you, you hear me? - I won't say a word, I swear. (bellboy grunting) And when we all went in to see the body, he took us out and then took all the jewelry. (camera clicking) That's all I know. - Could you identify that man? - No, I don't think so. I barely saw him. - Well, then you mean to tell me that someone stole a fortune and killed a man in front of you and you can't identify the man? - I was really scared. I couldn't really see him. - Look you. - Inspector. - Maybe if you let him cool off a little. It's obvious he's really nervous. - Hey, you. Okay, Rocha, take him to headquarters and question him there. Tell me, who stayed in this room? - Well, the room was reserved for Dr. Orapeza but he hasn't shown up yet. - If it's Dr. Orapeza, I know he's in Germany now. - Hmm. It's obvious he used his name, but I still need to make sure. - Inspector, my wife is really tired. - You'll be able to leave soon. Tell me, were those jewels insured? - Yes, of course, but the sentimental value is what's important. - Mrs. Fernandez, were there many who knew you were going to wear those jewels? - Well, I talked about it with two or three people, with a hairdresser. Everyone knew about the banquet. It wouldn't be hard to imagine that all the doctors' wives would wear their best jewelry. (detective laughs) - Yes, of course. Well, then you can leave now. Tomorrow there'll be more questioning. - Good, thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse me, can I leave too? I have many things to do and I- - Yes, but only after you answer some questions. There are a few things that could be useful to us. - What things? - The forensics report indicates that the hotel detective was killed by a karate chop. - The killer must be a very strong man. - Or a very skilled attack. Besides, why he killed the detective and not the bellboy, it doesn't make sense. Well, think of something Rocha. - Every time I think of something, you scold me, so. - Ah! Come in. - He saw all the photographs, boss, and he didn't identify any suspect. - Have a seat. Did you get a good look at the pictures? - Yes, and it was none of them. I'm absolutely sure. - Explain to me how you can be absolutely sure if you told me you couldn't get a good look at the killer. - Well, I, I, no, he wasn't any of them. I'm completely sure. - Has he signed a statement? - Yes, sir. - Okay. I don't have any evidence against you and the manager vouches for your conduct. I have no choice but to let you go, but I warn you just this once, don't leave town. - I have no reason to. I will continue my work at the hotel. - You can go. Don't let that boy out of your sight. - Mm-hmm. - Assign and agent to watch him. - Yes, sir. - [Narrator] National Bank of Mexico. (groovy music) - There you go, 450,000 pesos. Please sign here. - Here you go, sir. - Leave quickly. This money must be deposited before 11 so we can move it to our branch in Monterrey today. I will send a guard with you. - Yes, sir, don't worry. (groovy music) - If you say you saw me, I will kill you. (man grunting) - When I got here, he was dead. - How long has he been dead? - The coroner said about an hour ago. - Let's wait for the official report, let's go. - Take him away. - Tell me exactly, who was aware of this money being sent? - The manager and basically the entire accounting department. - Did you notice if anyone spoke on the phone or left the office after the clerk and the bank agent left? - No, no one, I'm sure. - Do you have any knowledge of any employees leaving recently? You know, someone familiar with the management of the funds? - No, I don't think so. There are a few employee changes in our company. - Thank you. Could you leave us alone for a moment? - Of course. - Here, I have him boss, but the doctor says he needs some rest. - I'll try to be as brief as possible, but I want you to tell me everything you remember. - I told you, when we got to the parking lot that man came to us and hit the cop. It was horrible. He killed him with one blow. - And then what happened? - He grabbed the suitcase from me and told me, I mean, he hit me. - Hit you where? - Be quiet. - So what did he tell you? - Nothing. He didn't tell me anything. He hit me. Believe me, that was it. - All right, take him to headquarters. - Boss, I think that- - Listen, Rocha, when I need your opinion, I'll ask for it, shh. (man laughing) Have you noticed that both witnesses seem to be frightened, as if they are afraid to speak? - That's right, boss, and the last one? - Yeah, this last one made a mistake. First he was saying that the killer told him something, but tried to cover it up. - What was it? - Could it be that the killer threatened to kill them if they said something? - Mm-hmm, it could be. - I'll bet my job on it. - I wish. If we guarantee all of them protection, maybe we can get them all to talk. - No. Nah, it wouldn't do any good. Fire has to fight fire. - Mm-hmm. - You know what we're going to do? - Yeah. No, no, actually I have no idea. - Frighten them. Frighten them even more. (man knocking) Come in. (groovy music) (man gulping) - What's going on? Why you look at me like that? - You better confess everything. You'll avoid more problems. - To confess? Confess what? - You planned the robbery. You were very clever, but we discovered you. There's also evidence against you. - Are you crazy? It wasn't me, you must- - Of course it was you. You'll pay for your crimes with long years behind bars. - You have to believe me. I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. - [Detective] Who was it then? - The masked man. He was the one who killed the cop and took the money. It was him. He threatened to kill me if I said anything. He's very strong. You have to protect me. - We will, I promise you. But tell me, did that man wear a mask or something else on this face? - No, he was wearing a mask like the ones wrestlers' wear, a blue mask. - A blue mask? For a moment I thought it... No, well, you can leave. You're free to go. - Free to go? Then you believe me? - Yes, of course. Go home and get some rest. - Thank you. Will I get protection? - I promise you. One of my men will take care of you. Agent, let him go free. - [Agent] Yes, sir. - A blue mask. Rocha, do you like wrestling? - More or less, you know? - I suspect from this case, you'll become an expert on it. (crowd cheering) - [Woman] Olivera, whoo, hi there! (water splashing) (paper rustling) - Nothing. Not a word in the news. - Relax, it's only a matter of time before the publish it all. - Time. That's what we don't have. - (exhales) Maybe the witnesses haven't talked yet. - And maybe they never will. I can't wait any longer. Blue will have to pay for the 10 years he sent me to jail. I will show him that when I told him I'd have my revenge, I wasn't kidding. - Everyone knows that Inspector Bones is a good friend of Blue. He might be protecting him. - It's possible. Yes, that's why he kept it out of the press. - If they don't publish them, our plan may utterly fail. - I won't allow it. We have to do something. - Boss, do you think we could use Vengo's help on this? - Of course, why didn't I think of him? Do you know where to find him? - No, but I don't think it'll be hard. - Bring him to me. This time, Blue won't be able to hide behind the inspector. - Ready Rocha? - Ready, sir. - Let's go. - How can I help you? - Let the manager know we're looking for him. - Who's looking for him? - Inspector Ponsi from the police. - Ah, right away, sir. Sir, Inspector Ponsi's here. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. The manager is waiting for you in his office. - Thank you. - How can I help you ma'am? - I'm with Tiana's magazine. I would like to interview Countess Minelli. - Mm-hmm. - No, no, I know she doesn't give interviews, but I would like to see her personally. She can't refuse. - I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to let anyone without the proper author- Okay, then, but be discrete. Suite 145. (suspenseful music) - Ah, I certainly hope you can recover the jewelry of Dr. Fernandez's wife. - I'll get them back, I assure you. - Come in. Come in, come in, Ricardo. The inspector wants to talk to you. Come with me. - [Inspector Ponsi] Maybe I can help you remember some things. - [Ricardo] But I already told you everything. - Everything? About the man who stole the jewelry and killed the detective who's wearing a mask and that he threatened to kill you if you said anything? - [Ricardo] Okay, okay, that's true. The man was Blue Demon. - [Inspector Ponsi] How are you so sure he was Blue Demon? - [Ricardo] He's my idol. I never miss any of his fights. - Hey! What are you doing there? Get down from there immediately. (kick striking) Oy! (gentle music) - I don't know. - You know where I can find Rango? - Mm-mm. - Okay. (gentle music) (man knocking) - What do you want? - I'm looking for Rango. - Never heard the name. - Hey, who do you think you are? - Shut up! Where is he? Hey, Rango. You know I gave away a lot of bills so I could find you sucker. - Jaime, Jaime, Jaime. What do you want? - I came here for you actually. An old friend of mine wants to talk to you. - Well, it's just that I'm already retired. I haven't done anything anymore, you understand me? - Yes, I know, don't worry. - I'm all clean. - Don't worry brother. - Nothing's gonna happen to you. We just wanna chat. Is this enough proof? There's more where this came from, you know. - Okay, get moving. Get yourself cleaned up so you can go with this man. (drums beating) - [Man] Adrian Posos, to the gate, you have a visitor. (men grunting) - Huh! Wow, takes a lot of strength to do that, right? - Yes. Especially to kill a man with one blow. You were thinking about that, right. - Yeah, but not that Blue Demon did it. It'd be absurd. - I do agree with you on that. Blue Demon. - Hi, Inspector. What brings you here? - We need to talk. It's important. Now you see why I needed to warn you. But don't worry. I'm sure everything will be just fine. - Do you have any clues? - No, unfortunately not yet. But I'm still investigating everything. I hope something turns up soon. - Tell me, who's the guy who accused me? - Ricardo Pederosa. - Oh. The hotel bellboy. - Yeah, you wanna see him now? - No, sooner or later I will. - About time. Patty, ask Jaime to bring him here. - Yes, sir. - It was a mistake to bring him here. - Maybe, but there will be time to fix that later. Hello, Rango. Long time no see, right? - Guillermo, I thought you were still in- - Forget about that. - Okay, okay, are you still in business? - No, and you? Still doing the same? - I, no, believe me, I... - Look, I really don't care what you do. I called you because I need you to do a special job. You're a journalist. - Well, I was, but you know that alcohol drowned me. - I do. But you still must know all of your colleagues. - Well, I haven't seen them in a long time. - Listen to me, Rango. I have sensational exclusive news, a big scoop. I'll give you all the intel. The only thing I'm interested in is it's published tomorrow. You know how to do it. - Well, if it's that good, it could happen, but I need to know what it's about, understand? I don't want anymore trouble. - You won't have any, Rango, I guarantee you. I just want our killer to pay for his crimes. - Who? - Blue Demon. - Blue Demon? - Have you seen the news? - I have enough with my own problems. - Well, Demon, I'm pretty sure this problem will interest you. - Blue Demon accused of murder. Oh, man. They must be out of their minds. Get me Inspector Ponsi on the phone right now. I'm sorry I asked you to come, but I'm very worried about the news in the papers. - I was as shocked as you were. Of course, you know I would be the last to blame you. - So, how did it leak then? - That's what got me worried. Only three people heard the bellboy's statement. Rocha, but he wouldn't do it and the hotel manager, who wouldn't do it either. - And what makes you so sure? - He more than anyone else would suffer from this. This could ruin the hotel's reputation. - Have you shared in the newspaper offices? - What for? The damage is already done. - [Man] You can't complain. Now everything's according to plan. - Yeah, it's not bad. - He did a really good job. He earned each and every penny you gave him, boss. - Yeah, he did a good job, but we can't let him become a danger or a threat to all of us. - I don't think he would ever dare to do anything against you, boss. - But you know, he's the only link between us and the newspapers. - If you want me to, I can take care of that little business, boss. - Yeah, make sure he doesn't talk. - I see, so that's how the news got leaked. Someone was listening to the bellboy's statement through the air duct. - That's what the manager told me. The warehouse manager found her. - And you didn't ask you employee if he could recognize that woman? - Not really. He says he saw her for only a few seconds. - Anyway, I'll send an agent with some photos to the hospital to see if he recognizes anyone in them and also a sketch artist to get a good portrait. - It will be great for this to work out. I will inform this to the manager. - At least we finally know who we're dealing with. - This is Blue, go ahead, over. - I managed to find out the name of the person who gave the information to the newspapers. His name is Adrian Posos, over. - [Blue] Do you know where to find him? Over. - I'm on my way to talk to the person who's going to give me that information. Over and out. (man knocking) - Hi, it's you, come on in. Adrian. Adrian! (Adrian groaning) - Jaime. What can I do for you? - I have another job, but we need to talk privately. No, not there. I'd rather we go to the roof. - Okay. (people chattering) - What can I get you, dude? - No thanks, nothing right now. I was told that you could tell me where Adrian Posos lives. They call him El Rango. - Well, you were told wrong. - Look, I need to get a hold of him. If you help me, I'll reward you well (laughing). - Well, that's different. He lives close, a block and a half away in an old building. I think his apartment is number eight. - Thank you, my friend. Thanks a lot, that's for you. - Good luck. - Goodnight. - Well, here we can speak with no problems. What's that job you want to discuss? - It's related to the job from the other day. Guillermo doesn't want you to say anything about that. - Huh! I mean, he knows me. You know, I'm very loyal to him. - When you're sober maybe, but when you're drunk. - I stopped drinking long ago, man. - I wanna make sure of that. (men grunting) - No, Jaime, don't do it. Are you crazy? I'm not a snitch. I won't say a word. - Guillermo doesn't take any chances. - Don't be stupid. I won't say anything. No, no, no, help, ah! - Rango, now you won't. (man grunting) - [Man] Stop! (man laughing) - Hold it, who turned out the lights? Where is he? Where is he? Where'd he go? Oh, that way. (man grunting) Oh, my God. (man groaning) - Ay, ay, ay. It was my fault, it was my fault. I shouldn't have got cocky, but I felt I nearly had him in my hand. (man snorting) - Did you recognize him? - Of course. I will never forget that face. - Obviously they killed that man so he wouldn't talk. - Which confirms my theory that everything is geared to incriminate me, the news in the papers, the killer posing as me and there is no doubt they will continue to try and harden me with every chance they get. - You're totally right. - The bellboy, he must be protected. - Careful, be careful, Blue. Ay, ah. - Did you call, ma'am? - Come in. - Thank you. - There are some dresses in that suitcase. Take them out, please. - Of course. Ma'am. (Ricardo groaning) (suspenseful music) - This is your idea of standing guard, officer? Where is the boy? - The bellboy went over there. He went upstairs to service someone. - Didn't I tell you to keep your goddamn eyes on him at all time, you idiot? Outta my way. - Boss. - Where can I find bellboy number 14? - On the ninth floor. - Thank you. (slow jazz music) - I'm sorry, but we were late. - I am late. - But do you really think I killed him? - I have to, given this evidence. Don't move, Demon. - Have you gone mad? - Maybe that's exactly what's happening to you. Put that down and come with me. Let's go. (gun firing) - I heard a gunshot, what happened? - Blue Demon is escaping, you didn't see him? - Is he the one wearing a blue mask? He went over there. - Shut up, clown. (door closing) Back up. (Inspector grunting) (drums beating) - Then Blue Demon is behind all of this? - Well, I wouldn't say it exactly that way. - It's just that the way you found him doesn't even allow for the slightest doubt, plus his cape, it's proof of his guilt. - I admit that the evidence and the fact that he fled are against him, but before we judge him guilty, we must listen to him. We need to know why he acted this way. - Inspector, can we publish all this? - Forbidding you would stop you from doing it? (all laughing) - Well, thank you. - Hasta la vista, guys. - Have a great day. - Thank you. - [Man] Good luck. - Do you really believe Blue Demon is innocent? - I don't know what to think. On one hand, everything is against him. Demon, a killer? It's absurd. I know it doesn't make sense. - So what do you plan to do then? - To catch him and talk to him. It's the only way to clear up this whole mess. - Yeah. - Hey, is someone watching Blue Demon's dressing room? - Of course, boss. Demon, he can't run away. - That's what you think. With Blue Demon, you never know. - Yvette, the police have surrounded the arena. I'm sure the Inspector is trying to stop me. You and Herman go to the secret level laboratory. I will see you there, over. Guys, I need a favor. The police are after me and I think I have to... - [Announcer] Now begins the tag team match between Blue Demon and Cesar Valentino. This is the first fall. The two giants of wrestling are quick to start the fight. Irish went to the ropes, oh, followed by a great hip throw, courtesy of the master of masters, Blue Demon, the masked man. (speaking foreign language) The wonder of the world faces off against Cesar Valentino. Oh, what a head butt. Blue Demon goes for the pin, oh. Can't get it. From the heel side, coming in to stop the count is Felipe Romero. The fans are on the edge of their seats for this match. Black Shadow is having a hard time in front of Valentino who applies heavy right punches. Black Shadow is tired, he looks beaten. Black Shadow goes to the ropes and takes a look. Oh, what a fantastic frog pin, but he's quickly interrupted from behind by Felipe Romero and Buffalo Perez. Here he comes, it's Heels versus Baby Faces in this arena. Oh, back breaker by the powerful Romero. He goes for the move again. This is a tough match. The arena is ready to burst. Nobody knows who's winning so far. Double horn bar. What's gonna happen? Oh, Giant Warrior is eliminated in a highly dirty way. The Baby Face team loses one member and there's only Blue Demon and Black Shadow left. What will happen now? The two men face off. He grabs, oh, he's down on the mat. The crowd's going crazy. Check out those beautiful flying scissor from Blue Demon to Cesar Valentino. Both men get on their feet, but Blue Demon repeats the move and on the other side, we can see Black Shadow fighting with all his might. Oh, another heavy back throw from Valentino. Oh, another Irish wood throw for him. He goes to the ropes and comes back to a heavy right hand blow. But from behind comes his tag team partner, the powerful Romero to try and help. What a back and forth battle. Oh, but look at that, he's sent outside above the third row by Blue Demon. And here we go the action continues. The crowd is going crazy for their favorite wrestler. Head collision in the middle of the ring. And now Blue Demon and Black Shadow are using a rarely seen and extremely powerful star hold to eliminate Cesar Valentino and Romero and they have won the first fall. It's the Baby Face corner. (siren blaring) And now begins the second fall of this awesome Australian tag team match. From the blue corner comes Black Shadow and from the red we have Cesar Valentino. Cesar begins with powerful right punches. Black Shadow gets up and with a left arm upper cut ejects his opponent over the third row. Now the tag must happen. In comes Buffalo and on the other side comes the Giant Warrior. Blue Demon assists his partner with a heavy kick over the ropes. By the way, Blue Demon is fighting tonight under heavy pressure because he's been involved in scandals, in robbery, in crime and murder and yet here he is, even with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Blue Demon uses quick arm throws on Romero and he repeats the dose. Now the Heel is quickly exiting the safety outside of the ring onto the ropes. Just hear the roar from the crowd. In the stands, on the ringside, everywhere, it's master versus master. Here he goes, he's looking for a move. Look at that, Black Shadow goes for a flying scissors take down, but misses. This kind of wrestling- - What was he thinking. - [Announcer] Greco Roman style. He's looking to apply a hold and the tag happens again and in goes Blue Demon versus Buffalo. Irish went for Buffalo and he comes back to a heavy backdrop by Blue Demon, master among master. Check out that double arm back hold. - What was that? That's cheating, man. Go for the eyes, Blue, go for the eyes. Referee are you blind or are you stupid? - Rocha! - [Announcer] We have to remember that this is a Heel versus Baby Face team match. Two versus one right now. Blue Demon was about to fall victim to a Boston crab, but he escapes with his strength. Buffalo tries to get a hold of him again, but he misses and now Black Shadow enters with great speed after the tag. Here's Black Shadow, he sends his opponent to the ropes and receives him with a heavy drop kick. The Heel is now out of the ring. Felipe Romero is down on the arena floor. Let's see how he comes in now. This is a beautiful match between Heels and Baby Faces. Blue Demon awaits in the ring while Black Shadow gives us another great move, look at that. It's another scissor hold, no, and he's out on the ring again. And we'll see who comes in now for the Heel side. This is the second fall. Oh, look at that, left, right. Blue Demon is against the ropes, but Felipe Romero is falling outside of the ring again. Valentino's all alone against heavy hitters. He gets up quickly. Oh, look at that double hit. Shadow's holding him down. Never, oh, look at that, another slam to the mat. There's an abdominal stretch and a camel clutch. Looks like it's all over. - Excellent! - [Announcer] That's two falls. What's going on? The light goes out in the arena. What happened? Who knows? Maybe it was a fuse box. Oh, the lights are back. Boss, where is he? - [Announcer] Blue Demon is nowhere to be seen. He's not in the ring. - I will never forgive the inspector for thinking that you are murderer. - It's only logical he'll think that after he found me next to a dead boy. - Now everything is more difficult with the fuzz after all of us. - They are only looking for me. You will be able to move with freedom. - No, no, no, no, just in case, I'm gonna hide. (woman laughing) - Don't be ridiculous. - The fuzz won't find me like this. (Blue knocking) - Who the hell are you? - Don't be afraid. I just want a few words with you. - I ain't got nothing to say to you. - Well, then, would you be interested in finding your husband's killer? (woman sobbing) - They went up to the roof and from there he threw him down. - Do you know where your husband met that guy Jaime? - [Woman] He told me he met him at the neighborhood pool hall, but they hadn't seen each other in a while. My husband stopped going there a long time ago. - By any chance did your husband mention anyone else? - No. Well, he talked about an old friend, the one who gave him the money. But I never knew who he was. (woman crying) - Thank you. - [Man] Yes, boss. I'm on my way there right now. And if Jaime's ever been there, I'll find him, over. - [Blue] Keep me informed. I will be at the office, over and out. (groovy music) - Hey, buddy, are you in charge here? - Yes, how can I help you? - I need information. I'm looking for someone that you may know around here. - Maybe. Who are you looking for? - A guy named Jaime. I was told he came here a lot to play pool. - The only Jaime I know in this neighborhood is an old, short and bald man. - That's the one, that's the one. You know where I can find him? - No, he hasn't come here for a long time. I know he works at the warehouse on 37th Street. In the same neighborhood. - Thanks, my friend. That's for you. - Okay, thank you. (phone ringing) - Hello? Is it you, boss? A guy came by asking for Jaime. No, no, I sent him to the warehouse on 37th Street. Okay. - Is this the place? - Yes, but I don't see any movement. No one seems to be there. - It's okay, we are going in. I am going to park. (groovy organ music) (door closing) - Cautious, man. - Let's go. (door creaking) (drums beating) You. - Uh-huh. (groovy music) (men grunting) - This way, man, this way. (guns firing) (man groaning) - Wait. - Who's your boss? Who's pretending to be me? - Cosaco. - Oh, Cosaco. - Cosaco. - Inspector Ponsi. I was just now in the warehouse on 37th Street. There was a fight, wounded man. - Turn yourself in. It'll be better for you, I promise you that. - He was the killer of the former journalist. You will find his body at the warehouse. - Hey, don't hang up! I need to see you! Hello! - Was it Blue Demon? - Yes. There's a dead body at the warehouse. The journalist's widow will tell us if the dead man is indeed her husband's killer. Let's go. (siren blaring) (man knocking) - I'm coming, I'm coming. Who are you? What the hell do you want? (woman screaming) - [Man] We here to rid the world of the witch. (woman screaming) - [Man] Come back here. - Let's go. Stop right there! Cover me, Rocha. (guns firing) - Up the stairs. Let's get outta here. (groovy music) - Call the guys at headquarters. - Yes, sir. - First Jaime and then those four? What the hell's going on? - Nothing, just that Blue Demon has started fighting back. - Damn him. - He's no Superman. He can die like any other. - But, I wouldn't allow that. Blue Demon deserves a very special death. - This is Blue. Answer me. - Copy, Yvette speaking, over. - Have you already called the commission about the Cosaco issue, over. - No, but Herman needs to see you. He has something important to tell you, over. - Why doesn't he call me over the radio, over. - He's having trouble with his radio. I could barely hear him. Yours seems to be working bad, too. Over. - I told him I couldn't give him any assurance of- - He's waiting for you at the corner of Artiega and Morris Streets. He said that- - What's going on? - I don't know, the communication suddenly cut off. - Then let's go to that address. - Yes. (radio beeping) - Get in, hurry. I realize that we were being tapped, but I couldn't stop you from saying where Herman was. - No I understand why the radios weren't working. - You know I thought I ran out of batteries. - Go on then Herman, you got it. (speaking foreign language) You will be our ears for a while. We can't use the radios anymore. - And where are you going? - I go visit an old friend. Now, in the commission they could only tell me that he had been in prison before for robbery. They had no more information about him. - Hmm, and you thought I will give your information about Cosaco, right? - If anyone knows anything, it's you. You know everyone who has climbed into a ring. - Yes, I remember him. He was a very good wrestler. He could have become champion, but... - Do you know where he is now? - No, they already told you at the commission. One day he just disappeared and... - You have no idea how important it is for me to find him. - Yes, I know. Several times the police have come here looking for him. That guy, Cosaco, it's quite possible he's wrestling somewhere. - I would have found him. - Even if he changed his name and wore a mask like you, you are not the only one wearing a mask. There's a way to recognize him. Whenever he fought, he used the Indian stake. It's a hold he invented, the only one who used it. - I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for the information. See you later. - We didn't have to wait long, he's coming. - It'll be the easiest money in my life. - And mine, too. Remember, this is a clean job, no weapons. Let's go. (men grunting) - Now you will talk or you will regret it forever. Who sent you? - Guillermo El Contara. The Count. - Ah, yes, the Count. - The boss wants to see you immediately, huh, right away or you'll regret it, man. - Pedro, take care of business, I'm going out. - He took the bait, good idea, after him. (drums beating) (door closing) - [Man] Inspector. They stopped at Risko Street, between Cascara and Fuego. - [Woman] Who's there? - Augustine. (men grunting) - Now, take his car and leave him anywhere. - What, you're going in alone? - Yes, it will be easier that way. (suspenseful music) - Who was it? - I don't know. No one was there, sir. (suspenseful music) (wood crashing) (men grunting) (water splashing) - [Woman] Hmm! (men grunting) (guns firing) - There you have him. He is the Count, responsible for all of this, boss of that gang. - Yes, I know. This takes a load off my mind. It was very difficult for me to believe that you were guilty of those crimes. I owe you an apology. - Forget it. How is it that you got here in such a timely manner? - Well, at the force, you know, we all do our own research, too. Call the coroner and check the entire property. - Yes, sir. - You coming? - Yes, okay. (man laughing) (woman laughing) - Nothing like feeling at home again, right? The Count won't be giving us anymore trouble. - Don't forget that we still haven't captured Cosaco. - But now where do you think you're going, huh? - To the gym. I need to make up for the time I lost. - Hey, man. Did they already set the date for the championship? - Yeah, it will be this Friday. - And that's just as far as that silly champion will get. - Of course. - Don't get cocky. Tigre is a very good wrestler. It will be a difficult match. I'm sure of it. - Hmm. - Um. (gun firing) - [Blue] There's something I don't get. I thought with the Count dead, it was all going to be over. Although maybe Cosaco, no, no, no. It's not possible. He's gone. Almost like if the earth had swallowed him whole. (men grunting) - He's training right now. Okay. Hold on a moment. Blue. Blue, you have a phone call. - Thank you. Yes, Blue speaking. - [Mabel] Would you be interested to learn who is the person that keeps attacking you? - Who are you? - [Mabel] An admirer of yours who wants to do you a favor, are you interested? - Of course. - [Mabel] Well, I'll wait for you at my apartment tonight. I promise you will find out everything. The address is... - Good afternoon. - My lady is waiting for you, please come in. - Thank you. (gentle piano music) Well, I'm here now. You made a promise to me on the phone. - And I will keep it. Tonight you will learn who is the person who wants to harm you and why. But we have enough time. A drink? - Thank you, ma'am, but I don't drink. - Not even a soda? Have a seat here by me. Believe me, I have been looking forward for this moment. You know, I'm very excited to have you here, Blue, as my guest. - Thank you, ma'am. - Cheers. I've always admired great men just like you. Heroes who fight for justice. I can't understand how anyone would dare to attack you. - Well, I'm always exposed to many kinds of danger. It's part of my job. - Some days ago I read something really awful about you in the newspapers. - That's already been cleared up. It was someone who want to discredit me. (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Yes? Yeah. Well, well, I know. In half an hour. I want the green car, yes, the new one. Yeah, things change. Goodbye. Excuse me, but it was something urgent. Are you feeling okay? - No, no, it's nothing, no. - Are you sure? This will be your last day Blue Demon. (women grunting) - My darling, did you really think it was that easy to kill me? - How did you find out? - You didn't think we would investigate your husband's records and discover you too were married. Connecting the dots and putting your name to the woman at the hotel wasn't that hard. - You bastard. (woman groaning) What are you gonna do with me now? - Nothing. We'll wait for Inspector Ponsi. He'll be here soon. - Well, I really need a stiff drink now, may I please? - Go ahead. - I suppose I don't have any way out of this now, do I? - None. - Well, I think this time. (Blue grunting) (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Yvette, write down this number, please. 596-2647. (radio beeping) Blue Demon here, over. - [Yvette] The number you gave me belongs to a warehouse on 37th Street, over. - I know the place. Tell Herman to meet me there, over and out. (groovy music) - [Mabel] Come on, hurry up. - [Man] Yes, ma'am, all ready. - Hello, Mabel. Going somewhere? - Hey, Cosaco, why are you so late? - He's not Cosaco you idiot. - Mabel is right Luis. (men grunting) (siren blaring) (men grunting) (siren blaring) (women grunting) - There they are! - Get up, get up. - There he goes. Take them away. - That way. - There they go. - The accusations of robbery and attempted murder are very serious. I think Mabel will spend several years behind bars. - She deserves it. That woman's a bitch. - Clearly, we can see that her love for her husband blinded her. I think she wanted revenge on me even more than the Count. - Yes, yes, they never forgave you for sending them to prison for 10 years. - He was sent by a judge. Blue just captured him and proved he was guilty, nothing more. - It's all the same to them. Tell me something Inspector, did Mabel confess who Cosaco is? - No. No, I think she still counts on him to get her revenge. You must be very careful Demon. - I will. And believe me when I say I would like to face him again. His a former W wrestler. - And now begins the final fall. In one corner is Blue Demon in his blue mask and the other is Tigre, the reigning world champion. The fall begins with a head lock, a move with a lot of strength. Tigre goes for the lock to the head, but Blue Demon shakes it off with only his right hand. Tigre still looks to put his rival in a hole. Tigre must want to tire and hurt the arms of Blue Demon, the man with strong and big hands. They go to the ropes and the hold must be broken, but Tigre doesn't want to let go. This is a classic match. Good versus evil. Baby Face versus Heel. The world champion Tigre is one of the strongest Heels in the wrestler's roster. Tigre's gone for a hold. Blue Demon twists and escapes and throws him to the mat. Blue Demon is waiting for another chance. These are two formidable men, really strong men. Baby Face versus Hell. Blue Demon puts Tigre on his back, but Tigre still has a lot of vitality. The match will have to go in the hand to hand department. Both men are measuring their power. Little by little, Blue Demon is chipping away at the stamina of Tigre. Now Blue Demon has him in a head lock. Tigre's trying to escape. He twists, grabs the arm. The challenger now takes the champion near the ropes without breaking the hold, but Tigre is resisting the attack. There's no doubt, oh, look at that throw, what a tough wrestler. Sometimes a dirty wrestler, but a tough one nonetheless. Never doubt it. Oh, look at that, he's going to the stake, a very strong and underhanded hold by Tigre, which is hurting Blue Demon's legs real bad. But he endures, oh, he tries, is he gonna tap, no he finally escapes and now he is the one using an arm hold, but a legal one. This is the third fall. The first fall was won by Blue Demon. The second fall was won by Tigre. This has been a grueling and incredible match by these two burley and strong wrestlers, two titans of the ring. Oh, Blue Demon hits Tigre with an arm take down. But Tigre's still getting up. Blue Demon won't let him recover, though. He now looks for full Nelson lock. Tigre is the victim of a full Nelson lock, a really painful move. Tigre tries to escape with some attack to the sides, but to no avail. No, wait, Blue Demon releases Tigre. The tables have turned. Oh, Blue Demon escapes and takes him down. Let's see what Tigre might try to do. This is the championship match, Tigre versus Blue Demon. Tigre's trying to use an Achilles leg lock, but Blue Demon resists. He's holding on, he screams no because the referee asked him if he wanted to give up. The crowd is impatient. Almost everyone in the arena is cheering for Blue Demon. They want him to become the new world champion tonight. Will the title change owners tonight or the reign of the Heel king, Tigre, continue. Blue Demon is pulling with all his might in Tigre's mask. He's pulling hard and twisting the champion's neck, so the referee makes him stop, an unnecessary, illegal move. Just look at the size of the hands of the challenger. The champion is hanging in there, but he's being squeezed by a leg wrench and we all know Blue Demon has incredible strength on the legs. Blue Demon is holding one. What a painful move. Oh, Blue Demon now changes the attack into a rolling cradle. There's the pin, wonderful move using only the legs by Blue Demon. However, Tigre reaches the ropes and the move must come to an end. The referee orders Tigre to let go of the ropes and Blue Demon can stop his hold. But we can see he didn't want to do it. Both men get up and Blue Demon continues the attack, relentlessly on this third and final fall. Here he comes. The crowd is euphoric for this match. Oh, left right blow to the head by Tigre. Now he continues the attack with multiple arm take downs. Oh, he goes for the take down again. Oh, but look at Blue Demon, he's able to escape using his legs. This is becoming an unforgettable match. Oh, he grabs his neck, oh, he slams him to the mat. Body slam, Blue Demon takes some distance to assess the damage, but look at that, Tigre's still standing. How strong is this man? He goes to the ropes. Oh, overhead slam by Blue Demon. The challenger is looking to end this match. He takes him down, looks for a cradle pin, but Tigre's still able to escape the move. What a match. This will go down in history as a classic. Blue Demon still has him pinned. What's Tigre gonna do? Oh, he's trying to use the stake. The stake is a weird move, a terrifying move, but Blue Demon doesn't give up. The third and final fall still continues. Blue Demon, the man of the azure mask wants to be the new world champion. But Tigre goes for the stake again. He's applying his trademark hold. He really wants to end this. He's now using both hands to increase Blue Demon's pain. This is pure torture. It would seem we're going back to the medieval torture times. However, Blue Demon doesn't give in. He's holding on like a true champion. What strength he has. How is he gonna get out of this? Blue Demon doesn't give in and he finally escapes. This title match is about to be decided. Blue Demon counterattacks the stake with his own trademark, inverted leg hold. Tigre's doing what he can to resist. Oh, these guys are so tough. He screams no. The referee asks him if he wants to give up. This is it, folks. This could be the end of this long and amazing title match. The crowd and the arena is on the edge of their seat. The men cheer for Blue Demon and some less so, but for Tigre, as well. Look at that, Tigre escapes by rolling away. Oh, look at the roll. Oh, but he falls victim to that fine scissor take down. Once again, flying scissors by Blue Demon. What a move, incredible. He now takes the champion against the ropes and uses a powerful inverted Judo throw. Now he repeats the doses, here it comes. However, Tigre the world champion is so strong and he resists. Oh, look at that, Blue Demon goes for the little package pin. But Tigre almost turns the move against him, but Blue Demon was able to control the move. And now he changes it into a frightening abdominal stretch. Oh, the pain. The champion is bravely resisting, but can he keep it up, can he do it? The referee looks closely. No, no, stop, the champion just tapped out. The match is over. Blue Demon has done it. Blue Demon is the new world champion. But wait, what's this? What's going on? Blue Demon is trying to take off the mask of Tigre. We don't know why Blue Demon's taking off the mask of Tigre. Again, this is not part of the match. What's going on? The crowd and everyone here's excited, because now we will get to see who is the man behind this mask. - Inspector, come here. Here you go. Here's Cosaco. - How did you know. - I will tell you later. For now, arrest him. When he insisted on using the Indian stake, I understood that the man in front of me was Cosaco. It's been one of the hardest matches in my career, but that gave me the strength to win. - But you won. You're the world champ. Plus, Cosaco will spend many years behind bars. - Well, now let me take you all out to dinner to celebrate this. - Yeah! This victory calls for a toast. - I propose we toast with vodka. After all, the victory was over a Cozak. - Ah, but if it's with vodka, we'll have to smash our glasses after the toast in a stone chimney. (all laughing) That's all folks. - The end.
