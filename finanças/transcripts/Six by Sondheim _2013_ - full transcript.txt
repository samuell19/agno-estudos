I like neurotic people. I'm neurotic myself and I like neurotic people-- MICHAEL DOUGLAS: Everyone is, aren't they, to a degree? Well, that's exactly what I think. You see, I think it's universal. Neurotic is one of those fashionable words that to some people means crazy. What it means is that everybody is troubled. Everybody has problems, and there are problems of circumstance, and there are problems that start when you're young and you're growing up and there are professional problems and there are personal problems. Nobody goes through life unscathed, and I think if you write about those things, you're going to touch people. SONDHEIM: When I get famous I'll be free on my own You wait and see... EARL WRIGHTSON: While no one can predict the future of the theater, the American musical theater, one thing is very certain. Talented men, such as our guest today, are going to be making very important changes from time to time. Mr. Stephen Sondheim. TERRY WOGAN: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Stephen Sondheim. LARRY KING: Someone who's made the musical what it is today-- Stephen Sondheim. STEPHEN COLBERT: Please welcome Stephen Sondheim! MICHAEL DOUGLAS: Here is Stephen Sondheim. CHARLES OSGOOD: He's often called the father of the modern American musical. He earned the title by experimenting with form and content. He earned it by asking audiences not to sit back and relax, but to sit up and take notice. DIANE SAWYER: Not that Sondheim suits everyone's taste-- If you don't know the name Stephen Sondheim, you know his words and music. WOMAN: And the Tony Award goes to... MAN: Music and lyrics, Stephen Sondheim. SONDHEIM: Woman, take my view... WOMAN: ...by Stephen Sondheim. MAN: ..."Sweeney Todd." SONDHEIM: I'm telling you... ANNA QUINDLEN: Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Sondheim. SONDHEIM: ...make your dream true I mean, an awful lot of people have gone historically to musicals to forget their troubles, "Come on, get happy." I'm not interested in that. I'm not interested in making people unhappy, but I'm not interested in not looking at life, 'cause then I don't know why I want to write it otherwise. SONDHEIM: I have no idea where the music came from. My father used to pick out tunes, Broadway tunes on the piano. And when I was a kid, he would put my hand on his fingers so I would sort of feel like I was playing the piano. And then I took piano lessons when I was 7 years old, which is what every nice Jewish boy did on the west side, for two years. And my mother was very visual, and she was a very talented designer, and I have no visual talent whatsoever, so there goes the entire theory of genes. The Stephen and the Joshua were chosen by my parents out of the Bible. They didn't know what to name me, so they just flipped the pages open and put their fingers in and it came out Stephen Joshua. In fact, I was known as Josh until I was about 10 or 11 years old. I always thought I was born at 3:30 in the morning 'cause my mother told me that. She wanted me to feel that I had kept her awake and made the birth as difficult as possible. I found out from my father I was born at 9:00 in the evening and it was not a difficult birth at all. That disagreement was sort of typical of them and ended in a divorce 10 years after I was born. My mother got custody of me and bought a house in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. There was a kind of myth that if your family broke up, what you needed was discipline, so you were sent to military school. Again, the surpri-- JEREMY ISAACS: Did you need discipline? I don't think so, but I loved it. Everything was so chaotic at home, that to be told to be at a certain place at 9:12 and another place at 9:37 and to have to go on parade and that sort of thing-- again, I was 10, 11 years old; we had little wooden rifles-- but it was called New York Military Academy. And I thrived. I thought it was terrific. My father was a dress manufacturer, and he was certainly the most liked man in the industry, but not the most successful. And they go together, I think. His second marriage was very successful. He married a very nice lady, and so I liked my stepmother and my father very much. He loved the theater, so when he had his visiting privileges with me-- the court-appointed visiting privileges, he would take me to musicals. I was an only child, and both my parents were working parents, so because I had no sort of childhood companion, and my mother was a celebrity hunter-- she knew slightly the Oscar Hammersteins, and they lived about 3 miles away. So she sort of foisted me on them because they had a son my own age-- actually a year younger, Jimmy Hammerstein. And as a result, I sort of osmosed myself into the Hammerstein household, and Dorothy and Oscar Hammerstein became my surrogate parents during my teen years, and that's essentially how I became a songwriter, because I wanted to do what Oscar did. You know, I've often said that if he'd been an archaeologist, I would have been an archaeologist. Maybe I wouldn't have had the talent for archaeology, and luckily he was in a profession that obviously I have gifts for, so it worked out very nicely. But it was essentially imitating him. I majored in music at college, and I always wanted to write music and lyrics. And the first show I wrote that was scheduled for production was called "Saturday Night," but the producer died and the show didn't get on. And I was then asked to do just the lyrics for "West Side Story." I was 25 years old at the time. I'd been writing music up until then, and I didn't want to write just lyrics, but Oscar said that it would be very good experience for me, even though I would be frustrated not writing music, because I'd be dealing with people with enormous talent and ability-- that's Leonard Bernstein and Jerry Robbins and Arthur Laurents. And I would learn a great deal through practical experience, and I should not worry about the time lost in not writing music, and he was right. LARRY KERT: Could be Who knows? There's somethin' due any day I will know right away Soon as it shows It may come cannonballin' down through the sky Gleam in its eye, bright as a rose Who knows? SONDHEIM: Well, there's the true nostalgia. Lenny and I wrote "Something's Coming" essentially in one day, which was one of the most exciting days of my life. And we finished at about 11:00 in the evening and we woke Felicia-- Mrs. Bernstein--up, got her out of bed, and played it for her, and she sleepily said, "It's wonderful," and went back to bed, having not, I don't think, heard the number, poor thing. But we had to share the excitement, and tonight I got it all over again. I mean, it's a song I dearly love. We wrote it during rehearsals because the boy playing Tony, named Larry Kert, wasn't registering in his first scene with the kind of weight that made you want to follow his adventures through the show. And I suggested that we write a song that has real drive to it. A paradigmatic one would be... Hallelujah, hallelujah The kind of thing that Judy Garland made her reputation from, a driving, fast-beat song. GARLAND: The Lord is waitin' to take your hand Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy... SONDHEIM: And that's exactly what we did. And Larry did it on opening night in Washington and stopped the show. It's only just out of reach, down the block... SONDHEIM: He had the audience in the palm of his hand, and it gave him confidence. It was his first major musical. Of all the people in the cast, he had to be the one to carry that strength forward, and that number gave him that strength. KERT: Could it be? Yes, it could Something's comin', somethin' good If I can wait Something's comin' I don't know what it is But it is gonna be great SONDHEIM: What surprised me about it and still does is all the baseball terminology comes out of--you know, "one-handed catch," all that sort of thing. Somehow I got the image of Tony as a ball player. I don't mean specifically; it's just the words kept-- those were the images that occurred to me, and they're the right images. You know, "cannonballin' down through the sky," all that stuff about forward motion, and I know what it was. It was echoing Tony's desire to move forward, to get away from his gang life, and he knows there's something around the corner that's gonna make his life perfect, And you just--whoosh!-- and it's a baseball. ...Catch the moon, one-handed catch Around the corner Or whistlin' down the river Come on, deliver To me Will it be? Yes, it will Maybe just by holdin' still It'll be there Come on, somethin' Come on in, don't be shy Meet a guy, pull up a chair The air is hummin' And somethin' great is comin' Who knows? It's only just out of reach Down the block, on a beach Maybe tonight MAN: Mr. Robbins, how does it feel now that the opening night is over? Well, we're all very tired and also very happy. SONDHEIM: The opening reviews in Washington mentioned everybody connected with the show. They were all raves, except me. I was obviously disappointed and chagrined, my first professional show. And so, on the morning after, I was riding from the theater back to the hotel with Lenny. And he said, "Look, the lyrics are yours. I'm perfectly happy to take my name off the lyrics." And I said, "Oh, that's really nice of you. Thank you." And he said, "And, of course, we'll adjust the royalties." And I said, "Oh, who cares about the money? It's just the credit." If somebody had only put a gag in my mouth at that point, I would have made a lot more money over the years. But the fact is, we all thought the show was just gonna be sort of a prestigious show. Nobody dreamed that it would be a hit and, in fact, it wasn't a hit. The movie was a gigantic hit. The show was not. The show was disliked by most people. Score was particularly disliked, particularly in the papers and by the public, all of whom said they couldn't hum it. It was all very exciting, but they couldn't hum anything. Then, 4 years later-- there were only two single records made from "West Side Story" in a period of 4 years: one by Johnny Mathis and one by Dinah Shore. Johnny Mathis sang "Maria," Dinah Shore sang "Tonight" and that was it because everybody said, "Yes, it's very exciting theatrically, but you can't hum those tunes." And then the movie came out and, of course, the movie company put a million dollars or so or maybe more into the advertising of the movie and they started making the disc jockeys-- or getting the disc jockeys to play the tunes, and suddenly everybody could hum them, which is why the word "hummable" about songs drives me up the wall. BERNSTEIN: I expected, after "West Side" that a lot of new, young people would come in and take the next step and the next step, next step, and by now we'd have had something that we could call the equivalent of opera, American opera. And we don't, with the solitary exception of Steve Sondheim, who does take a step with every show he does. Well, now we're leaving the music of Mr. Bernstein and going to discuss Mr. Sondheim as the composer, not just the lyricist. From now on, that's going to be the set-up, is it not? Well, with the-- there's always possibly an exception, but I intend from now on to write my own music because it's about 3 times as much fun as writing lyrics. But there may always come along something that's just so wildly exciting that I can't keep my hands off it. ETHEL MERMAN: Here she is, boys! Here she is, world! Here's Rose! Curtain up Light the lights Play it, boys! You either got it Or you ain't And, boys, I got it SONDHEIM: I was supposed to do music and lyrics for "Gypsy," and David Merrick and Leland Hayward, who were producing it, it's OK with them, OK with Arthur Laurents, and Ethel Merman had just been burned by two young writers; that is to say, she had had a flop and blamed it on the inexperience, or having two young writers-- a show called "Happy Hunting." So she was very wary of taking a chance on another one, so she said no, and then Arthur and Oscar-- again, Oscar said, "It'll frustrate you even more, but now "you have a chance to write for a specific personality, and that's something you should learn to do." And he was right, that was also very valuable because we wrote that show not for Madam Rose, but for Ethel Merman as Madam Rose because she and David Merrick came up with the idea together to buy Gypsy Rose Lee's book, and so she came with the package. Usually I just write and then we cast it, but in this case, we were writing for a very specific lady to take advantage of her strengths and to minimize her weaknesses. And so it was good experience. but it unfortunately taped me as a lyric writer, which I knew it would, so the minute I started to write music, I was treated by critics and public and the old pros--and still am-- as a sort of upstart: "How dare I," "Why aren't I satisfied just writing lyrics," and, "I can't write music, so what"--you know. If I'd started out as a musician and come to the lyrics, they would have said the same thing. One of my favorite Ethel Merman stories-- it's apocryphal, it's been attributed to other people, but I like to believe it's true of Ethel, because it is profoundly true of Ethel-- is the time that she went on "The Loretta Young Show." Loretta Young was a lady with a capital "L" who had a half-hour show, she was Catholic, and she did not like swearing on her set. And Ethel had the mouth of a truck driver, so when Ethel came in for rehearsals, it wasn't long before she said, "Where's the damn prop?" And Loretta came over to her and said, "Ethel, "I really don't approve of swearing, and anytime anybody swears on my set, I charge them a quarter." So Ethel gave her a quarter, and a few minutes later, of course, Ethel was annoyed at something else and she said, "God damn it!" And Loretta said, "Ethel, a quarter, please." Ethel dutifully gave it again. And a few minutes after that, of course, Ethel said, "For Christ's sake!" And Loretta Young came over and said, "Ethel--" and before she could finish the sentence, Ethel said, "Loretta, here's 10 bucks and go fuck yourself." The songs I write don't really reflect me in any conscious way. I mean, they all are about the characters that the book writer has made, and I'm getting into those characters. I never think of it in my own terms at all, no. I get to know the style, the way they think, the way they speak, and I get inside them almost as if I were an actor playing the part, and then I write. But I always take from the book writer. I couldn't invent those people. Often what attracts me to material in the first place is that I find some way of projecting myself. Like all writing, you know, there's no difference. Part of the author is always in what he writes and part of it is a work of imagination. As soon as you write anything, obviously it must touch on something. It's that thing that Faulkner said about observation, imagination, and experience. You can do without one of them, but you can't do without two, and writers and actors observe. It's true that in every character you write, a part of you is there somewhere. That's true of every author, but there's only been one autobiographical song I've ever written, and that was "Opening Doors" in "Merrily We Roll Along." It's about two writers trying to bust their way into show business and their best friend. It's about me and Hal Prince, it's about Mary Rodgers, and it's about Sheldon Harnick, it's about Jerry Bock, it's about all of us in the fifties, knocking on the doors of producers and trying to get heard. I was trying to recapture what I was like when I was 25 and 30 years old. The show goes backwards in time and ends up in the early sixties, late fifties, and I wanted to write songs that they would have written in those days without making a comment on them. You try to write what you were like when you were 25 years old, you're gonna have a lot of trouble, and I did. FRANK RICH: It turned out pretty well nonetheless. Yeah, it turned out great. Rrr! Oh! How's it going? Good. You? Fair. Yeah, tell me. Chinese Raundry. Hi. Mary. Say hello! I think I got a job Where? "True Romances." Posing? Thank you. Writing captions. What about the book? What about the book? Nothing. Are you working on the book? Yes. Good. No. Mary! Right, I know, yes, me and Balzac Ugh. I finished the one-act I got an audition I started the story Rehearsal pianist So, where are we eating? I'm moving to "Playboy" The publisher called me I'm doing a rewrite My parents are coming I saw "My Fair Lady" I rewrote the rewrite I sort of enjoyed it I threw out the story I'm meeting an agent ALL: We'll all get together on Sunday We're opening doors Singing, "Here we are!" We're filling up days On a dime That faraway shore's Looking not too far We're following every star There's not enough time I called a producer I sent off the one-act I started the story He said to come see him I dropped out of college I met this musician I'm playing a nightclub They're doing my one-act I'm working for "Redbook" I rewrote the ballad I finished the story We started rehearsals I threw out the story and then the musician I'm moving to "Popular Science" ALL: We're opening doors Singing, "Look who's here" Beginning to sail On a dime That faraway shore's Getting very near We haven't a thing to fear We haven't got time OSGOOD: In a sense, your fascination with puzzles, you can't help but wonder about whether that's in any way analogous to putting together a show. Oh, it is, very much. Sure. I think that's what art is anyway. I mean, after all, a puzzle is like art, is making order out of chaos, you know? Take a jigsaw puzzle, right? It's chaos. Put it together, it's a picture. And I think art is the same way on a slightly higher level. SONDHEIM: When I moved to my first apartment in Manhattan, I didn't have enough money to buy prints and put them on the walls. But a girl I knew gave me an early 19th-century game, a weird one called the New and Fashionable Game of the Jew. It was a dice-throwing, chip-betting game that taught kids to be anti-Semitic. And it was a hateful game, but it was really pretty to look at, and she had it framed for me. And I went to the store where she bought it-- it was a rare bookstore-- and the owner had a lot of 19th-century games. And I bought a lot of them 'cause they only cost two and three bucks apiece, and that's what started my game collection. It's a curious and perverted ability to be able to see a word as a collection of letters instead of as having a meaning or a sound. For example, you love puns. So obviously the sound of words is something you're very into and you're very quick and good at puns. And of course, the precision of your language. You just don't see words as collections of letters. I passed under--when Cinerama first was invented, I passed under the sign that was being erected on Broadway. It said "Cinerama" and I immediately thought "American." Didn't have to think about it. PREVIN: Wait a minute. "Cinerama"-- And "American" are anagrams of each other... SONDHEIM: Actually, it was Oscar Hammerstein who got me interested in words and crossword puzzles and anagrams. He played Anagrams at his house, and he did the puns and anagrams puzzle in "The New York Times." As a matter of fact, he encouraged me to send a puzzle in to "The Times" when I was about 13, and I did, and it was rejected very nicely by them with a letter that said that they admired my perspicacity, and I had to look the word up to find out what it meant. What is that? It's priest Have a little priest Is it really good? Sir, it's too good, at least Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh So it's pretty fresh Awful lot of fat Only where it sat Haven't you got poet or something like that? No, you see, the trouble with poet Is how do you know it's deceased? Try the priest Heavenly! SONDHEIM: I still get pleasure out of-- out of writing a musical phrase that I think is really good. I still get a pleasure out of writing a line that I think really encapsulates what I want to say. And you know instantly when it's right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. When it's right for me, absolutely. There's that first moment, you know, the first-- the first flush, the falling in love, and then you got to let it cook and see if you're still in love in the morning 'cause it's a form of showing off. But it's also a form of sharing. You want to say, "Hey, I caught this moment" with people. But it's a wonderful feeling. It's a wonderful feeling. It's what everybody who writes or paints or composes feels, or else they wouldn't go on with it. If you didn't get those moments, you couldn't put up with the rest of it: the loneliness and the tedium and the endless amounts of work, you know, the sweat. I love inventing. The hard part is the execution, obviously. But even that's fun, the working out. When I say "fun," of course, I'm talking about agonizing fun. I'm not talking about pleasant fun. To make art sound effortless takes a lot of effort. And another thing, Dick. If you and Larry don't fix up the opening for that second act by tomorrow-- Excuse me, Mr. Morley. This is Miss Marrel, the feature writer of the United Syndicate. Good evening. Mr. Hart. How do you do? Mr. Rodgers. How do you do? She'd like to do a story with you. Gentlemen, you're about to be interviewed. Wait till I fix my tie. Don't you like being interviewed? Well, I don't mind as long as you don't ask us which we write first, the words or the music. SONDHEIM: The question asked of most songwriters is, "Which comes first, the music or the lyrics?" And most people think it's a dumb question. It isn't; it's just very hard to answer, and it varies from writer to writer. When I have written with Leonard Bernstein or Jule Styne, sometimes the music came first, sometimes the lyrics. In the case of Jule, mostly the lyric. In the case of Lenny, mostly we wrote together. But when I write with myself, I do what Cole Porter did. I found, by going through his papers at the Library of Congress, that he would take his title line-- like "It Was Just One of Those Things"-- and he would write it out rhythmically: "It was just one of those things" on music paper, but with no notes attached, only the rhythm. And from that, he would extrapolate the melody. The inflection of the title would give him the rise and fall of the melody, and the rhythm of the title would give him the rhythm of the melody. It was just--heh!-- one of those things. Just one of those crazy flings One of those bells That now and then rings Just one of those things SONDHEIM: Once I get a scene, I sometimes will put the scene on the easel of the piano and just improvise at the piano, just reading the dialogue. Other times, I will scour the dialogue for useful phrases that might be refrain lines or central ideas. I strictly lie down-- ISAACS: How can you write lying down? Uh, because it's easy to fall asleep. Actually, I do that less than I used to, but I got in the habit of doing it. No, one of the reasons I have bad posture is from many, many years of hunched over a piano and lying down with a pad propped on my knees. I work entirely with Blackwing pencils for a number of reasons. One is it's very soft lead and therefore wears down very quickly. So you can spend a lot of time re-sharpening, which is a lot easier and more fun than writing. I've often used alcohol as a help in writing. It's very good for loosening up the inhibitions as long as you don't drink too much. And in fact, the only thing I've ever written that's just on water was the score for a movie called "Stavisky." And I realized it was 'cause I didn't have to write lyrics. There are so few words in a lyric that each-- 3 or 4 words is the equivalent of a scene in a play or a chapter in a novel. And unless every word is right, it stands out like a sore thumb and becomes much bigger than you had intended it. And it's very hard because of the limitations of the language and the restrictions of what music does to words to come out with a lyric that is consistently good from beginning to end. WOMAN: It's a very short road from the pinch and the punch To the paunch and the pouch And the pension... SAWYER: I'm trying to imagine what it is to be able to sit down and write, "It's a very short road from the pinch and the punch to the paunch and the pouch and the pension." Does it make you laugh? Yeah. Once I got the idea of that song-- Well, it's true of all the songs I write of, particularly when they're very verbal songs. You make lists is what you do, and you start getting into the character. It's always about getting into the character, and you start to make lists of what she would talk about. And you suddenly find that certain words either-- if they don't rhyme with each other, relate to each other. And things can catenate. It's very much about serendipity. It's a very-- "Oh, I didn't think. Pinch? Paunch! Pension!" Once you get the idea of, let's say, jowls, and you think of pouch, you say, "Wait a minute. "You know, that--maybe we can make something out of the similarity of those sounds." I've never heard an audience laugh as much and as loud and as long as they do at his lyrics in this show. Audiences don't listen to lyrics, incidentally, very much. I think they do because they love-- Because they have so much to take in. You have to take in music and lyrics-- JAMES MacANDREW: You mean, if they don't hear your lyrics-- you have to blame it on Mr. Montresor and Mr. Rodgers? No, I don't blame it on anybody. I think we'd argue with you. Seriously. I think they don't listen, 9 times out of 10, for the right reason. A song starts and it says, "When you took my hand"-- and they say, "Yes, you took my hand, "we fell in love, all right. Let's get through this song." But Steve's lyrics always have a development of what has been said in the scene. They always carry it further, they're always written in the diction of the character. I mean, not only funny. I think it's easier to be clever than it is to carry a character further, and I think he's the only one who can do it today. SONDHEIM, VOICE-OVER: As a writer, I think what I am is an actor. I'm an actor when I'm writing songs, and it's one of my strengths as a writer and one of the reasons that actors and singers like to sing my stuff. It's not only the insight of the librettist and me working together, but the fact is I write conversational songs, and...so that the actors find that the rise and fall of the tune and the harmonies, and particularly the rhythms, help them as singers to act the song. They don't have to act against it. I thought you loved Clara. I did love Clara. I did. But no one has ever loved me As deeply as you No one has truly loved me As you have, Fosca Love without reason Love without mercy Love without pride Or shame Love unconcerned with being returned No wisdom, no judgment No caution, no blame No one has ever known me As clearly as you No one has ever shown me What love could be like until now Not pretty or safe or easy But more than I ever knew Love within reason, that isn't love And I've learned that from you SONDHEIM: Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music... in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author and so they shine and bubble and rise and fall is very, very, very, very, very hard to do. And whereas you can sit at the piano and just do that-- Feel you're making art. My piano technique is moderate. I have a very good right hand and a very lumpy left hand. I'm very right-handed. A lumpy left hand? Oh, yeah, it's good-- good for that sort of stuff. But the right hand is very flashy. If you write at the piano, you tend-- first of all, your muscle memory tends to make your fingers fall into the same chords. And secondly, if you have a bad left hand, it's gonna show up in the music, so I try to write away from the piano as much as possible. Do you always have music playing in your head? Ah, when I'm writing, yeah, yeah. Always. For the entire-- Yes, and when it turns out to be somebody else's tune, I get very worried. Seriously. If I wake up in the morning and I'm humming "Some Enchanted Evening," I take a very close look at what I wrote the night before. SONDHEIM, VOICE-OVER: Oscar Hammerstein talked to me about Jerome Kern. Jerome Kern was, you know, maybe our grea-- he was the Schubert of the American musical theater, you know, probably our greatest melodist. And you think he gets up in the morning and he goes: You are the the promised kiss of springtime And he's just--coming out of his head in the shower, just jots it down, whatever. Oscar told me about writing that song. He said, "I was in one room writing the lyric. He was in another room," and he hears Jerome Kern go... Every single key, he just--he took-- he tried every single note in the scale until he got the one-- Now he had to go on. And that's how one of the most gorgeous, free-flowing melodies ever written came out. And I thought, "Boy, that's good news for the rest of us." MAN: One thing about Steve Sondheim-- when he likes a song, really likes it, he'll say, "No, that's a good song." Then, the fact that I don't like it or don't get it, which is not all that infrequent-- it's quite frequent that I hear something; the first time out, and I don't know what I'm listening to. And he doesn't force it on me, but when he says, "No, that's a good song," by God, it is. Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground You in midair Send in the clowns HUGHES RUDD: When you sit down to write a show, do you make a conscious effort to write hit songs or-- Oh, no, no. I've had very few hit songs, actually. They generally tend to step out on their own if they're going to become hits. I don't know what makes a hit song. Every writer who's ever had a huge success wrote what he wanted to write, and it hit. Nobody sits and says, "OK, now the formula for a show is we'll have a nun and a dog and Abraham Lincoln." Ha ha! And it never works. I want to be able to stand in the back of the house and be proud of what I see, not just in terms of my own work, but say, "Yes, that musical was worth spending a year and a half of your life on." Most of the biggest hits of the twenties, thirties, and forties came from shows and movies. Starting in the fifties with the rock revolution. The split, the divergence occurred, and so you could get shows that were huge hits without any hit songs. The fact about "Send In the Clowns" is that for two years after the show opened, when that song was available, only one person was attracted to it-- a man named Bobby Short. And then, about two years later, both Judy Collins and Frank Sinatra got interested in it, and the artists made the hit. I've often claimed that "Hello, Dolly" might not have been a hit if Louis Armstrong hadn't picked it up. Often it is the artist--meaning, in the English sense, the singer-- who makes the song a hit. DOUGLAS: Was that a surprise to you that that became a hit? SONDHEIM: Oh, absolutely flabbergasting. It's my only really big hit song, and it was designed as a little throwaway song for a touching moment for Desire. There's a, as you probably know, a tradition in show business that some of the best songs and some of the most popular ones were written out of town, while a show is trying out of town. And everybody says, "Isn't it remarkable "what pressure will do to a writer, how it'll make you "write so well when you only have a few days in Boston or in Philadelphia to write?" Well, the truth is, it's not the pressure; it's the fact that you see the cast and you know who you're writing for. I wrote "Send in the Clowns" for Glynis Johns, who was the star of "A Little Night Music." She did not have a song in the second act, and Hal Prince, the director, felt that she should. There was one big scene between her and the leading man, and I always felt it was the leading man's scene and I was outlining a song for him. And Hal said, "Let me show you the scene," and he directed the scene in such a way that even though on paper it was Fredrik's scene, by the time I saw the scene down at rehearsal, it was Desire's scene. I went home and wrote the song that night. GLYNIS JOHNS: At 10:00 the next morning, when we started rehearsal, Steve put his hands and played the first chord. And my eyes absolutely brimmed. I was absolutely choked, like I am now. And I looked at Len, who was not an emotional person, or doesn't show it, and his eyes were filled up, too. We knew. We knew. The first few chords. SONDHEIM: Glynis was not a singer with a capital "S." She had a lovely, sweet bell-like voice, which was breathy and short-winded, and so it's written in short phrases. Isn't it rich? Pause, pause, take your breath. Are we a pair? Pause, pause, take a breath. Now she got a sustained line. Me here at last on the ground Breath. Pause, pause, breath, so, you know, it's not hard to sing. Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? Me here at last on the ground You in Midair Send in the clowns Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? One who keeps tearing around One who can't move Where are the clowns? Send in the clowns Just when I'd stopped Opening doors Finally knowing The one that I wanted Was yours Making my entrance again with my usual flair Sure of my lines No one is there Don't you love farce? My fault, I fear I thought that you'd want what I want Sorry, my dear But where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns Send in the clowns What a surprise Who could foresee I'd come to feel about you what you felt About me? Why only now When I see that you've drifted away? What a surprise What a clich Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late In my career? But where are the clowns? Quick, send in the clowns Don't bother They're here I've had letters all over-- all during the years from people who say they love the song, but they don't know what it means. And in fact, I even remember Frank Sinatra, who, after all, was responsible for making it a hit, he was asked in an article what the lyric meant. He said, "I don't know, I don't care what--look. "Ya meet a girl, you take up with her, ya leave the girl. Send in the clowns." BERNARD LEVIN: Do you call yourself a poet? Do you write poetry apart from your lyrics? Never, never. No. Never? Do you think it's a different-- you're a different world? Really? Yes, it's mostly because-- You do write poetry. You call it lyrics, but so what? No, you see, I think they're poetic lyrics. It's not a question, and that's not modesty in any way. It's a description. Poetry seems to me to exist in terms of its conciseness, how much can be packed in. Lyric-writing has to exist in time. The audience, the listener cannot do what the reader of poetry does. He cannot go at his own speed. He cannot go back over the sentence. Therefore it must be crystal clear as it goes on. That means you have to under-write. You have to lay the sentences out so there's enough air for the ear to take them in. Also, what has to be considered, and what not enough people who write dense lyrics consider, is that there's a great deal going on besides the lyric. There's music, there's costumes, there's lighting. There's a lot of things to listen to and look at. And therefore, the lyric must be, in that sense, simple. It can be full of complex thoughts, and it certainly can have resonance, but it must be easy to follow. That is not true of poetry; poetry need not and probably often should not be easy to follow. "Oh, what a beautiful morning" is a line I'd be ashamed to put on paper, but once you hear it with Rodgers' melodic line, it's-- Couldn't be better. That's known as poetic. Oh, what a beautiful mornin' Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feelin' Everything's goin' my way SONDHEIM: Hammerstein's most famous opening number is "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning," which was a startling number when he wrote it because most shows--in fact, probably all of them, opened with chorus numbers. And here came a lonely cowboy, came strolling onto the stage and started to sing a cappella and then the orchestra joined in, and right away, the audience knew they were in for something odd, and therefore it prepared them for the rest of the evening. People do not understand that Oscar was an experimental playwright, that his--I think his major contribution to the theater is not the songs, but the playwriting, and you could say, "Oh, "but those plays are so naive, those characters are so naive." But think of the theatrical imagination going on with them. My entire generation, you know--Bock and Harnick, and Kander and Ebb-- our entire generation of songwriters + is based on what Oscar encouraged us to do. Well, he really literally taught me everything I know and mostly in one afternoon. When I was 15 years old, I'd written a show for school. I asked him to judge it as if he would judge a professional show, because I was so sure it was so wonderful. He said, "In that case, it's the worst thing I ever read." I was terribly upset because I thought I was gonna be the first 15-year-old to have a show on Broadway, you know? He really did say, "The worst thing I have ever read"? "Worst" sounds cruel, and he was not cruel that way, but he made it very clear that if I were going to ask for professional standards, he was going to treat me like a professional. But he did say, he said, "It isn't that it's "untalented; I think you're talented, but I'll tell you where it's wrong." And he then went through the show, word by word, all the songs, all the dialogue, to show me where everything was terrible. And I picked up from that afternoon a couple of principles which I'm perfectly happy to pass on... EARL WRIGHTSON: Please do. such as that a song should be like a play. It should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. It should have an idea. State the idea, and then build the idea and develop it and finish. And at the end, you should be at a place different from where you began. I probably learned more about writing in that afternoon than I've learned the rest of my life. 'Cause it was all just force-fed to me as if I was a Strasbourg goose. It was just crammed into me, and I've never forgotten it. I can repeat everything he said that afternoon. And everything he said, incidentally, was true. He did not say a single thing that I disagree with. My style is entirely different than his 'cause one of the things he told me to do was not to imitate him. "If you write what you feel, it'll come out true. If you write what I feel, it'll come out false." And of course, he was right. "Write for yourself." Then he said, "If you do, you'll be 90% ahead of everybody else." And, of course, the minute he put it into those competitive terms, I zoomed away from him and never wrote like him again. If I didn't take what he gave us and further it, there would be no point. All of us have done that. And others will do that after us, I hope. But the whole point is to further things, to take what you've gotten and make more and make more and go in different directions, but always based on what he was telling us. You can't learn in a classroom and you can't learn on paper. You only learn by writing and doing and writing and doing. As a friend of mine says, "Write something, put it on. Write something, put it on. Write something, put it--" Well, you can't always put it on, but that's the only way to do it. That's how everybody who's ever been good got good. He may--hasn't much that's plus You might describe him thus A false alarm A broken arm An imitation Hitler and with littler charm But, oh Can that boy foxtrot His mouth is mean He's not too clean What makes him look reptilian Is the brilliantine But, oh Can that boy foxtrot... We were in Boston with Follies and we were having...a problem with the song called "Can That Boy Foxtrot," which had originally been written as a throwaway song for a minor character. But Hal Prince, the director, had cast Yvonne DeCarlo, who was a movie star. She was a name in the cast, so whatever number she sang had to land. It didn't necessarily have to stop the show, but it had to-- you had to feel that it was worthwhile, her being in the cast for her to have sung this number to you. DAVID FROST: What was the song that went out? It was called "Oh, Boy, Can That Boy Foxtrot." SONDHEIM: That was the joke. And you do that once, it's funny. You do that twice, it's all right. You do that 8 times? Ha ha! "I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it." The number was just sort of a filler. It didn't really relate to the emotions or the story of the evening, and it was just a number for a movie star. So we knew that we could improve it if I could find a way of replacing it. And I couldn't think of a song to write for her, and we were sitting around a table--James Goldman and Michael Bennett and Hal Prince, the directors, and I-- and James said, "You know, it probably should be, "you know, a song of surviving. I mean, well, you know, I'm still here." And I said, "That's it. Thank you very much." And just that single phrase then suggested the whole song and this whole history of her life. YVONNE DeCARLO: I've slept in shanties Guest of the W.P.A. And I'm here Ha ha! Danced in my scanties 3 bucks a night was the pay And I'm here I've stood on breadlines with the best Watched while the headlines did the rest In the Depression, was I depressed? Nowhere near I met a big financier And I'm here SONDHEIM: So I thought, "I'll write something of substance." And I thought about, "All right, this lady is an ex-movie star who's now in TV," and being a movie buff, I thought, "I know, I'll base it on Joan Crawford and her career." She started as a silent film star. Then she became a sound star, and then she eventually became, you know, superannuated and started to do camp movies where she was a hatchet murderer and, you know, she did "Baby Jane," all that sort of stuff. She became a joke on and of herself, but she survived. She survived, what everyone thinks. I thought, "That's who this lady is." And so I took Joan Crawford's career and the history of the United States through-- Well, because she went through all those things. She went through Beebe's Bathysphere, she went through the...you know, the King's abdication. She lived through all those era--thing--at the same time she lived through what happened in Hollywood. She lived through the drug era in Hollywood. She lived through the Communist scare in Hollywood. I thought, Put all that together and now there's at least a song of substance so it doesn't have one childish joke on the word "foxtrot." And, at least--so if it doesn't stop the show, fine, but the audience will know that they've been served a meal and not an hors d'oeuvre. Good times and bum times I've seen them all and, my dear I'm still here Plush velvet sometimes Sometimes just pretzels and beer But I'm here I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes I have strummed ukuleles Sung the blues I have watched my dreams disappear But I'm still here I've been through Reno I've been through Beverly Hills Now I'm here Reefers and vino Rest cures, religion, and pills And I'm here I've been called a pinko Commie tool But I got through it stinko By my pool, I I should have been through an acting school That seems clear Still, someone said-- WOMAN: You're sincere. So I'm here I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover Wow, that was fun and a half When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover Well, anything else is a laugh Black sable one day The next day it goes into hock But I'm here Top billing Monday Tuesday you're tourin' in stock But I'm here Oh, first you're another sloe-eyed vamp Then someone's mother Ooh, and then you're camp And then you career From career to career And I'm almost through my memoirs And you know that I'm here I've gotten through "Hey, lady, aren't you whose's?" "Ooh, what a looker you were" Or, better yet, "Oh, lady--sorry" "I thought you were whose's" "Well, what ever happened to her?" Good times and bum times I've seen 'em all and, my dear I'm still here Plush velvet sometimes Sometimes just pretzels and beer But I'm here Well, I've run the gamut A to Z 3 cheers and, damn it, c'est la vie Well, I even got through all of last year And I'm here Look who's here I'm still here, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You better believe it I'm still here I'm still here I'm still Here PRINCE: I think because "Follies" was such a cult show and there's been so much written about it, the fact that it did not pay off was something of a "scandale." To hear it spoken of, it was this great disaster economically. The reason for that is that everyone thought it was a success until it closed one day and then they suddenly realized, "My God, it never was a success." SONDHEIM: One of the advantages of having a collaborator is you're never slammed in the face alone, even if you get the bad reviews. It's still you're in a boat with somebody. I had three successes my first 3 times out. They were not personal successes. I got terrible reviews or completely ignored, but they were successes. I was making a living. I could afford to write another show-- "Anyone Can Whistle," which came next. When I saw that it was going to be a failure, I thought I'd be devastated, and I wasn't. I was disappointed that more of my friends wouldn't get a chance to see the show, and that's really the extent of it. You know, it wasn't sort of resilience and chin up. It was, you know-- I like writing songs, I like writing shows and, you know, if that had been my first show, I'm not sure I would have bounced back. But then I experienced a real failure when I did "Do I Hear a Waltz?," which Arthur Laurents was-- based on a play by Arthur called "Time of the Cuckoo." I thought, by adapting "Time of the Cuckoo" as a musical with Arthur doing the book-- I liked writing with Arthur-- I would be doing Arthur a favor, and I would also be paying off my unspoken promise to Oscar to write a show with Dick Rodgers. And we thought, "Well, this will be an easy job and we'll make a quick buck." Those are all reasons never to write a musical. Do I hear a waltz? I want more than to hear a waltz I want you to share it 'cause, oh, boy Do I hear a waltz? SONDHEIM: It was a respectable show. It was not lambasted by the critics. It was very politely received, and politely received by the audience, and had no passion and no blood and no reason to be. And I learned from that the only reason to write is from love. You must not write because you think it's gonna be a hit, because it's expedient, or anything like that. It's so difficult to write, it's so difficult to put on a show, you better-- if you have the privilege of being able to write it, you write it out of passion. That's what failure taught me, and that was the real failure. JAMES LAPINE: When I met you, you were pretty down in the dumps after "Merrily We Roll Along." SONDHEIM: Yeah. You were even talking about-- you know, maybe tryin' to do somethin' else or-- Yes, it was personal. I really felt, paranoid or not, and I think Hal did, too, that everybody in, as we say, "the business," really wanted us to fail. They were glad that the show was-- and I thought, "I can't work in this hostile atmosphere." I really--you know, because you do have to go out there in public, and I'm a Broadway baby, you know? Luckily, I discovered the joys of off-Broadway, and that's what revived me. When we wrote "Sunday in the Park with George," we didn't know it was gonna go to Broadway, and that was fun. You know, it was Mickey and Judy putting on a show. I'm sure I would have eventually gotten back to songwriting anyway, 'cause there's nothing else I could do, but that's what did it. MAN: A 5, 6, 7, 8. We love you Phone rings, door chimes, in comes company No strings, good times, just chums, company Late nights, quick bites, party games, deep talks Long walks, telephone calls Thoughts shared, souls bared, private names All those photos up on the walls "Company" is a show about marriage and the difficulties of marriage and the joys of marriage. And I had never been married, either officially or unofficially, when I wrote "Company." I thought, "How am I gonna write about something "I know nothing about? "I've observed marriages and I have feelings and opinions and insights, but I don't know anything about it." So I called my good friend Mary Rodgers, who was on her second marriage, and very happily on her second marriage. And I said, "Tell me about marriage," and she spent an evening with me and she told me about marriage, about her marriages, and about her observations on marriage. And I took a yellow pad out and I took notes, exactly as if it were a lecture, and "Company" is a result of that evening. It's the little things you do together Do together, do together That make perfect relationships The hobbies you pursue together Savings you accrue together Looks you misconstrue together that make marriage a joy Mm-hmm Uh-huh Kiss kiss Mm-hmm SONDHEIM: The reviews in Boston were, to put it mildly, mixed. One of the reviewers loved the show, and he loved it because he said it was anti-marriage, which, of course, it isn't. So we had the ironic reaction of reading a rave review by a guy who didn't understand the piece at all. The review in "Variety" was one of the most scathing I've ever encountered. The reviewer said it was a show "strictly for homos and old ladies," and I think he went on from there. MAN: "Being Alive," take one. Someone to hold you too close Well, you're very good, and I don't want to spoil something that's potentially marvelous, and I need more guitar. Let's hear guitar. JONES: Alive SONDHEIM: Now this is the first time I'd really like to feel rhythmic looseness, which you do right here. That's the explosion. That's the flower bursting. And that's where you can take rhythmic liberties. Just what you're doing is fine. JONES: Vary my days That's nice and free. But alone... Well, maybe there's one more in me. Let's find out, huh? Dino, practically swallow the mic on the end. OK, I'll stay on. Ha ha ha! We're gonna slow up the tempo, Dean. Someone to hold you too close Someone to hurt you too deep Someone to sit in your chair To ruin your sleep That's true, but there's more than that. Is that all you think there is to it? You've got so many reasons for not being with someone, but, Robert, you haven't one good reason for being alone. Come on, you're on to something Bobby. You're on to something. JONES: Someone to need you too much Someone to know you too well Someone to pull you up short To put you through hell You see what you look for, you know? You're not a kid anymore, Robbie. I don't think you'll ever be a kid again, kiddo. Hey, buddy, don't be afraid that it won't be perfect. The only thing to be afraid of really is that it won't be. WOMAN: Don't stop now. Keep going. Someone you have to let in Someone whose feelings you spare Someone who, like it or not Will want you to share A little, a lot And what does all that mean? Robert, how do you know so much about it when you've never been there? It's much better living it than looking at it, Robert. Add 'em up, Bobby. Add 'em up. Someone to crowd you with love Someone to force you to care Someone to make you come through Who'll always be there As frightened as you of being alive Being alive Being alive Being alive Blow out the candles, Robert, and make a wish. Want something. Want something. Somebody hold me too close Somebody hurt me too deep Somebody sit in my chair And ruin my sleep And make me aware of being alive Being alive Somebody need me too much Somebody know me too well Somebody pull me up short Put me through hell Give me support for being alive Make me alive Make me alive Make me confused Mock me with praise Let me be used Vary my days But alone is alone Not alive Somebody crowd me with love Somebody push me to care Somebody make me come through I'll always be there As frightened as you To help us survive Being alive Being alive Being alive SONDHEIM: My first serious relationship occurred when I was 60 years old, when I fell in love. And I think it didn't happen till then because I wasn't open for it, I wasn't ready for it. I was brought up as an only child. I enjoyed being an only child. I enjoyed being alone. I still enjoy often being alone, but I think I'd gotten in the habit of it, and when I met somebody, the habit got broken. Oh, that's the Forum. Oh. Well, yes. A funny thing happened on the way here, but I--I can't talk about it. SONDHEIM: Between my freshman and sophomore years in college, I had discovered that I would-- I had a lot of trouble with my mother and getting along with her, and she-- she didn't really want a child, but she was very... very much in love, I think, with my father and even obsessed with him. So when he left her, which he did, for another woman, the wrath of God had nothing on her, and she, unfortunately, tried to make me pay for the sins of my father and so it was not a very good relationship. And if it hadn't been for the Hammersteins, I really don't know where I would be, if I'd even be alive. BOB BROWN: A lot of Sondheim's themes come from having had his own expectations bruised as a young man when his parents divorced, and he got trapped in the middle of bitter resentments that never subsided, even as he grew older. He recalls a letter his mother wrote to him when he was in his 40s and she was entering a hospital to have a pacemaker implanted. SONDHEIM: And so she wrote me a letter and had it hand-delivered the night before she went into the hospital. And she said--opening sentence was, "Before I undergo open-heart surgery," which she had underlined 3 times, "I just wanted to tell you that I have only one regret in my life, which is giving you birth." And when I got this note-- and then she went on-- I thought--you know, I was stunned first and then I thought, "Oh, my God." I had always thought all those years that, like so many parent/child relationships, it was misplaced or misguided love and, you know, it was all about my father and she didn't know where to place her feelings. Then I realized she never wanted me on earth. I was an inconvenience. SAWYER: Do you want children? Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't have any. Yep. It's, uh, you know, I am. But art is the other way of having children, of teaching. I believe that very firmly. The idea of teaching a child everything-- from colors to clouds to music, it's-- teaching in the sense of opening up the mind. Not teaching; opening up the mind, which is what education is about. All education is just about making people curious. That's all it's about. And to get a child to be curious about everything would be unbearable thrill for me. Or a bearable thrill. MAN: These are my friends See how they glisten See this one shine How he smiles in the light, my friend My faithful friend Remember, this is a love song. It's, in fact, the big ballad of the show, is his love for his razors. So let's start it as a genuinely passionate, intense, semi-whispered ballad that keeps rising and falling-- intense, sexual ballad. And let's start again from that point of view, and let's not take any rubato. Let's keep it absolutely rigid to start with... so it has a trance-like quality. The reason that I wrote this rhythmically, so squarely is because he's falling into a state of almost semi-- of self-hypnosis. So it must have that feeling as opposed to conversation. The songs we've been working on so far this afternoon are all about conversation. This is exactly reverse. This is non-conversational. This is a ritual. SONDHEIM: I love teaching, and I've always thought that all art is a form of teaching. I think painting's a form of teaching. Any kind of communication is a form of teaching. And an artist, a visual artist shows us ways of looking at the world, and a novelist shows us ways that people behave; composer teaches us ways to listen. Is there any conscious decision to impart some information in songs, some information spoken-- SONDHEIM: Entirely conscious. I think people do not think carefully enough about what to sing and what not to sing. There's a tendency either to sing everything or merely to sing songs and speak. And I think there are certain shows that call for one technique or another, but the choice of what to sing and what not to sing is-- first of all, it's delicate, it's difficult, but it must-- they are choices that must be made consciously. But one of the things you will discover, I hope, is that, as your material goes to actors and actresses, you suddenly find yourself in the embarrassing position of having to defend what you've written because an actor will come to you and say, "Now, what did you mean by this line?" And you can't say, "Oh, well, what I mean--" You've got to tell them exactly what it means. You must be able to defend every single word and note. FERRARA: Well, the characters in "Merrily," when you first meet them, they're sort of at their most jaded and kind of most unlikable. What did you want the audience to take away from moving backwards and seeing these characters go from kind of their worst to their most innocent? SONDHEIM: It's a cautionary tale. It's what can happen to you. It's how ideals can get-- it's a show about expedience. It's about you got to be very careful if you're gonna take the expedient path. All they care about is getting their work done and having it heard. It is 3 idealists whose idealism is one of the things that binds them. The thing about "Opening Doors" is it catches the whole zeitgeist, the whole thing of getting excited when you're young writers and you're knocking on producers' doors and, you know, every moment is a crisis and everything requires a phone call and everything is at a level of hysteria until you finally get to the producer's office and then it's all a disaster. Finished! Let me call you back. This is just a draft. Probably it stinks. Right. Haven't had the time to do a polish. Will you sing? Right. Who wants to live in New York? Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat? Who wants the garbage cans clanging in the street? Suddenly I do They're always popping their cork I'll fix that line. The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks You got to have a real taste for maniacs Suddenly I do That's great That's swell The other stuff as well It isn't every day I hear a score this strong But, fellas, if I may, there's only one thing wrong There's not a tune you can hum There's not a tune you go bum-bum-bum-di-dum You need a tune to go bum-bum-bum-di-dum Give me some melody Why can't you throw 'em a crumb? What's wrong with lettin' them tap their toes a bit? I'll let ya know when Stravinsky has a hit Give me some melody Oh, sure, I know It's not that kinda show But can't you have a score that's sorta in between? But play a little more, I'll show ya what I mean Who wants to live in New York? I always hated the dirt, the heat, the noise But ever since I met you, I-- Listen, boys, maybe it's me But that's just not a hum-a-ma-ma-ma-mable melody Write more, work hard Leave your name with the girl Less avant-garde Leave your name with the girl Just write a plain old melodee-dee-dee-dee-dee Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee They're stopping rehearsals, they ran out of money We lasted one issue, my book was rejected The nightclub was raided, I have to start coaching My parents are coming They screwed up the laundry My wallet was stolen I saw the musician We're being evicted I'm having a breakdown ALL: We'll all get together on Sunday They're slamming the doors, singing, "Go away" It's less of a sail than a climb That faraway shore's farther every day We're learning to ricochet We still have a lot to say You know what we'll do? What? We'll do a revue What? We'll do a revue of our own Who wants to live in New York? Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat? Who wants the garbage cans clang-- I can sing higher. Thank you. We're looking for someone with a little more experience. Next. They're always popping their cork Up a tone. The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks Up a tone. You got to have a real taste for maniacs Thank you. You're hired. Oh! I'm Beth I'm Frank I really thought I stank I'm Mary Charley By the way, I'm told we open Saturday What? You're not serious? Nobody's ready Apparently somebody canceled a booking The songs aren't finished And what about costumes? And how do I learn all these numbers? I'll bring you the copies of everything later This evening OK But I'll have to have all of the music... We'll worry about it on Sunday We're opening doors Singing, "Here we are" We're filling up days on a dime That faraway shore's looking not too far We're following every star There's not enough time We're banging on doors Shouting, "Here again" We're risking it all on a dime That faraway shore's looking near again The only thing left is when We know we should count to 10 We haven't got time We haven't got time MAN: You are so admired not just for what you've made, but also for how you've been to people-- that you've been generous about teaching, that you've been honest, and that you have tried to be as helpful as you can be. When you...try to approach your work as all that you've done and all that people expect from you-- overwhelming? Well, the expectations come from the work, not from the teaching. Teaching, to me, is the sacred profession and I cry when I talk about it, and I'll probably cry now. But my life was saved by teachers; first a Latin teacher in high school and then Oscar Hammerstein, who was a teacher, and who... just before he died, gave me a portrait of himself. And I asked him to inscribe it, which is weird when you think that, you know, it's like asking your father to inscribe something, you know. And he wrote... Tsk. Gonna cry. He wrote, "For Stevie, my friend and teacher." And that describes Oscar better than any other way I can describe him. He understood that he--as you know, in "King and I," he said, "By your pupils you are taught." So teaching, to me, is... it's a necessity. I couldn't live without it. MARTHA TEICHNER: If you could conjure up Oscar Hammerstein right now, what would you say to him about your career, having sprung from him in so many ways? I would say, "Aren't you proud of me?" SONDHEIM: But when I write now, I'm aware that the people who like my work are expecting so much, and it makes me tense. TEICHNER: You've got to top yourself? It's not so much that you have to top yourself, it's that you want to write something fresh. You want to write something you haven't written before. So it's an act of courage, in a sense, to-- It sure is, and it needs more courage, I think, as you get older, and that's--see, that's what I didn't expect. I suppose if there's one that's closest to my heart, it would probably be "Sunday in the Park with George" because of the ambitiousness of what it's trying to say. James Lapine and I were talking about a play that James had directed, which had utilized this particular painting, "Sunday Afternoon." And we started talking about the painting and the fact that nobody in the painting is looking at anybody else, and yet there are 50 people in the painting. So why aren't they looking at each other? Are they hiding from each other? Are they in the park for devious reasons? Then James said, "The main character is missing." And I said, "Who?" picking up my cue. And he said, "The painter," and once he said that, we knew we had a show. It's like a photographer went out on the island, the Grande Jatte, and took a picture of a lot of people strolling in the park, the humanity of it. And I thought, "These people don't know "they're gonna be immortal, "and so I'm gonna write a song about that, "that it's gonna be outside of themselves, "they're gonna be talking, singing about themselves "and what they're doing, but they're gonna be acknowledging that they are immortal." And it all leads to the word "forever," which is-- when I wrote that word, I cried because I thought, "That's what it's about." And I then decided... that I would do it all in one sentence. It's a lyric that's in one sentence because there is a kind of... I don't know how to put it. Oh, it's--it's like-- it's eternal, it's infinite, it's whatever... whatever--it's what I feel about art. It just has no beginning and no end. It's just one thing. Then I could see that they would all be singing that one idea... that "here we are in a park and we're gonna be here forever." That's why it has that-- you know, it's got an almost funerary beat to it, you know? It's almost a funeral march, but it isn't quite. It's a triumphant march.
