(soft jazz music) (singing in foreign language) - [Woman On Phone] Then don't be so stressed. - [Woman] We're meeting about cover designs. What's there to be stressed about? - [Woman On Phone] Then it must be about your parents' party. Your entire family is going to be here. That's super-exciting and stressful. - While we're on the subject of the party, did you remember to call the venue and the caterers? - I did, the thing is confirmed, but your mom said she's meeting the caterers. She wants a different menu, and something about the cake, and to be honest, I really didn't want to argue with her. - I mean really, they could have just planned this party themselves. I think the only reason they wanted me to help, was so that they would have someone to disagree with. - [Woman On Phone] My parents do that to me all the time. - By they way, do you know when my brother and my sisters arrive? - [Woman On Phone] Let's see, Riki is arriving early next week. He wants to spend some time with you guys. - Yeah, I'm sure he does. Meet my, gambling, drinking, lavish lifestyle, I lost my fortune, everything bad happens to me, brother, who no doubt decided to arrive early so he can squeeze mom and Dad for some cash. Yeah I know, he's changed his ways and now does God's work. Right. - [Woman On Phone] And Melissa and her family arrive Monday before the party. Apparently, the kids can't miss school. - [Woman Voiceover] If you ever wanted advice on how not to live your life, you could get it from my oldest sister, Melissa. First she's married, then divorced. Then married again, to the same man, by the way. Her selfish, jobless daughter just dumped her two kids on my sister. Melissa probably hates her life. In fact, I'm sure she does. - [Woman On Phone] And Amy sent this email last night. "I'm sorry, I can't respond. "I'm in Paris at the moment." - So she responded to tell you that she cannot respond? - [Woman On Phone] Pretty much. - [Woman Voiceover] I'm sure every family has that one person who can't stop talking about themselves. That would be my little sister, Amy. Even when the world is in crisis, it's still all about her. - [Woman On Phone] As crazy as they all sounds. - I know. Family comes first. - [Woman On Phone] Yes, they do. (phone buzzing) - Oh, have to go, Oliver's on the line. - [Woman On Phone] Hmm, okay, tell him I said hi. - Hey. I just got home. I listened to your message. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stress you out, I know you've got a lot on my plate. - It's not stress, it's just. You know, they were asleep when I got home. - Just sounds like another excuse, Janet. They're always asleep, or not at home, or there's some kind of family emergency. Unless you've changed your mind. Janet? - I'll tell you what, why don't you come over tonight, and we can tell them together? - Okay. - Seven p.m.? - Yeah. - I don't want to be late for this meeting, so I'll see you tonight? - Okay, seven p.m. - [Janet Voiceover] And, as if life wasn't complicated enough, my not so little baby girl has decided it's time to go goth. - So, while you were on the phone with Oliver, again, grandma called. Grandpa's dead. (eastern music) - I don't know. We were at the caterer's, we were tasting the cake, and then suddenly-- - [Janet] You were at a cake tasting? - Yes Janet, that is what you do before you decide to buy. This is why we took it away from you. Then he just collapsed. He doesn't look dead at all. I keep thinking he's going to jump up and laugh at me for worrying. - Rigor mortis. After death, the heart stops pumping blood, and the body stiffens up. Basically it's like a Botox injection guys, mostly the wrinkles disappear. - Mommy, why didn't you tell me he was sick? - He wasn't. - [Janet] So what happened? - His heart just stopped. The doctor said it could happen to anyone. - Ventricular fibrillation. It's like an abnormal heartbeat. - You never know when it's your time. Do you remember that handsome Brahman boy we told you about? - Mommy, this is not the time to be setting me up. - Not everything is about you, Janet. - I know, right? - This is about your dead father. He's been spending a lot of time with that Pandit Ji. - Hmm? - Yes, he was trying to connect. - What are you talking about? - He was trying to rediscover his Hindu roots. - Mommy, mommy, are you okay? You're just rambling. Are you in shock? - I think we're all in shock right now. - I don't understand why I need to go and see this man of all people. Can't we just call the church, and the funeral parlor? - You can't rewrite this ending like you do with your books, Janet. - Oh mommy. - Your father, he wanted to explore all things. He didn't want to belong just to one thing. That's what he was like. - Mommy, you're not making any sense. - Just go and meet him Janet. Just go and meet him. Don't argue. - [Announcer] And away they go! Captain America comes forward. (announcer muffled speaking) (phone ringing) - 100,000 baby, double or nothing. - Two times. - Double or nothing, okay. Janet, baby girl. Let's get this party started. - Riki, where are you? - [Riki] I'm at the course. - The what? - [Riki] At the course, where we happen to be, you know the church (mumbling). Can we please pass the hymnbooks to the left? Thank you very much. - [Janet] I don't know how to say this, Dad has died. - Yeah, I'm coming in next weekend. - [Janet] Riki, Dad's dead! - Dad's what? - [Janet] He's dead. - Okay, hold on. Melissa's calling, does she know? - [Janet] No, she doesn't. - Let me connect her in. - Riki, I need that money back as soon as possible. The money you borrowed from me. Calvin is driving me insane. When you borrowed that money from me you promised to give it back by last week. I haven't even heard from you, come on. - Melissa, Dad's dead. - I don't have time for your jokes. - [Janet] Melissa? - Jan? - Dad's gone. - Was it an accident? - Amy's calling. - Is Mom okay? - Connect her in. - [Amy] Hello, hello! Bonjour. - Amy, I've got Riki and Melissa on the line. - Paris sends love to you all my darling siblings. - I can't believe he's dead. - Who's dead? - Dad. (chuckling) - That'll be the day. - He died a few hours ago. - What? - How did it happen? - His heart stopped. - That's impossible. - Apparently that can happen. - So, what now? - So now I've got to see this Pandit Brahman guy that Dad's been consulting. - For what? - And then I will find out. - [Riki's Girl] Double or nothing, baby. - I'm on my way, Janet. - That's great, Riki. Riki? (Melissa sobbing) - Mel, can you just pull it together please? I can't hear a damn thing on the phone with your sniffling. - You're actually gonna pick a fight with me now, when our father just died? - Oh, why is this so difficult? - Hello? Hello? - Hello, who's there? - The only sensible one. - Well, as the only sensible one, do you think you can say, goodbye Paris, and come home? - It's au revoir. Actually Jan, I wanted to tell you about these French classes I've been taking-- Hello? (faint eastern music) - Must inhale the smoke. Let go of your demons. - My what? - Cleanse yourself. Go on, breathe. Yes, you, breathe breathe, come deeper. Deeper, deeper. And let go. See what I did there? Took your breath away. So, Friday morning, 10 a.m., church here. One p.m. in the afternoon, Hindi or Hindu funeral, whichever you prefer. And then, five p.m. cremation. - You got that from the books? - No, that is what your father wanted. - Yes. So that's two funerals, well three, if you count the cremation. - Well, it's not like he's gonna complain now. You want to change it, let's change it. Here, take the book, pick a page, pick a date, I'll clear my whole schedule, I'm really busy, do it. Here, take it, do it. - My family 'cause they need to travel. - I'm not a travel agent, Missus Isaac. That is my cousin, Bernard. I'll give you his number, you phone him, he'll give you the best-- - I mean it's not Missus Isaac, it's Miss. Well Ms actually. - Your mother told me. You're not married, yet with a child. - Yes. - What, have you disgraced the family name? - No, no. - Secrets have a way of coming out. - What? - Whatever you want to call it, this way. Your family can travel today and tomorrow. - What if they are delayed? And they don't make it in time? - God, Missus Isaacs. - Miss. - Yes, sorry I forgot. Your mother told me, not married, with child, won't happen again. Your whole family must fast. No meat, no fish, no chicken, only vegetables, for 16 days. Three month, five month, seven month, nine month plays will be in the house. And then the final Vanya play, will take place in the 11th month, also in the house. - You mean the 12th month. - What makes you think you know the Bhagavad Gita better than I do, huh? - No, I'm just saying, one year has 12 months. - So, you're just saying our yearly calendar is incorrect, and that you are going to rewrite the whole Bhagavad Gita like you write one of your children's books. Is that what you're saying? No, it's correct. There is no need to get excited, Miss Janet. Just calm down. Go on, take a deep breath. - Is there anything else? - I don't know. You tell me. - No, I think, I think we're good. I should get going. I'm sorry Mister Pandit. I mean Mister Brahman. - There is a time to go, and there is a time to not go. This is neither. Dear God, if she really, hey shut up. Dear God, if she really loves me, she will come back. - Sorry, I forgot my shoes. - Thank you, God. (surf washing) (Janet sobbing) - Hey, I thought we were meeting at your place? Babe, what's wrong? Hey? Hey, what's going on? What's going on? - My, my Dad died. (crying) - Come here. (sentimental instrumental music) - Ma? - Hmm? - I brought you some tea. - Oh, thank you sweetheart. That is really sweet of you. That's a nice different look from your goth one. - Thank you, I'm keeping it for the funeral. - Nice. Okay, so now, which one? This or this? Black it is. - Ma? - Mm-hmm. - Aren't we supposed to be devastated and crying? Datha's never coming home again, and everyone is going on like nothing happened. - Darling, everyone deals with grief in their own way. Some people laugh a lot. Some people cry, other people go completely crazy. But I want to celebrate Datha's life. And I'm very sure he wouldn't have wanted us sitting around looking sad. - But I miss him so much already. What if I forget all about him, just like I did with Dad? - Oh sweetheart. Come here. Now listen. You are never going to forget your Dad. All right? And you're not going to ever forget your grandfather either. You know? You were Datha's most favorite person in the whole world. Did you know that? - I think Mommy has forgotten about Dad. - Why do you say that? - Everything is Oliver person. Oliver Dad, Oliver Dad. - Look, don't worry about it. Oliver, Oliver's just a friend. - No. They're totally dating. What if this gets serious? - [Grandma] It'll be all right. Trust me. Your Ma is here. - Candice! Help, please. - I hope you packed enough clothes. I'm gonna end up doing something because you didn't pack enough clothes, eh? You know what, go and pack some more clothes. - I packed enough, Cal. (phone ringing) - [Cal] Will you answer the damn phone? - I'm gonna answer it, I'm just packing the bags. - Well your daughter's not doing anything, why doesn't she help you? - Candice help, please. - [Child] I want ice cream. - You have that irritating ring tone but she wouldn't answer the damn phone. - Jan. We're gonna be leaving just now. - I thought you guys would be here already. There's a lot to do you know with these arrangements, with the church and the minister, and the priest. I don't even know what flowers to choose. - You know we were supposed to have left early this morning, and look at the time now. - Well, he sounds cheerful. - Tell me something I don't know. - Listen, have you heard from Amy and Riki? - No, why? - Their phones are off. - [Child] Daddy, can we have ice cream? - No. - What are we waiting for? - We're waiting for you to put on more clothes. And you, can you get off the phone so we can leave, please? (kids yelling) Will you get off the damn phone? - Jan, I gotta go. We should be there around five. - Yeah, sure. Drive safe. - And don't forget the keys. And put on the alarm. (light orchestral music) - Riki, Riki, Riki. - Babes, thank God it's you. I love you, Babes. - I heard about Daddy dying. - It's been rough, Babes. The family's coming over. The funeral's tomorrow, it's been rough Babes, come on. - Where's my money? - I got your money. - Oh, so this is all one big misunderstanding then? - Exactly, exactly. - Give me my money, then we can all go home. - I mean I don't have it with me right now. I mean, who carries 100,000? - [Babes] You had it all at the tracks. - Yes, yes I did, and then, you know. - A 100,000 dollars, double or nothing. (chuckling) - It wasn't like that, Babes. It wasn't like that. - That is what he said, right? - Babes, I care about you. I've got a lot of love for you. - The only man I ever loved in this world was my husband. Then I killed him, the minute I got a chance. So let's try this again. Where's my money? - Okay look, I need a little bit more time, okay? - This guy wants to die today. - No no no, I don't want to die, okay? Look, look, I'm not, I'm now dealing with a death, you know? There's a silver lining in each situation, and now that he's dead I can get your money next week, okay? - [Babes] Hmm, think your father would leave anything to you? - Of course he would, I'm his only son. (laughing) - You're the (mumbling). I wouldn't want a son like you. Uh uh. I like you, Riki. Tell you what, you have until Monday morning. - Oh that's great. Okay, great. I'll start the week on a brand new slate. Me and you, fresh. - No more horses, my love. - No no, no more horses. - No more tables. - None of this, I'm done, I'm done. - And, just in case, you get tempted, 'cause I know how you are. I'm going to give you a little reminder, okay? - Anything for you, Babes. - Good. - No wait, wait. Babes, wait! I think I love you. (screaming) (car trying to start) - [Message Voice] The person you're trying to reach is not available at the moment. - You know he's not gonna leave his wife for you. - He's not married, how many times do I have to tell you that? - It doesn't mean if you keep saying it, it's true. - Why don't you work on your own marriage? - Candice. - You're so annoying, leave me alone. Thanks for helping out with the car. - Not a problem, it's my job. - And what's that all about? - That's El Diablo. - [Candice] It's evil. - Who has a night before for a funeral? - It's what your Dad wanted. - Oh it's more like, what that Brahman Pandit guy whatever told us to do. There's something so strange about him. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Aren't you coming inside? - That's gonna be way too awkward. - Roy, this is my family. - I know you are going through something really bad. You just need to find the time and tell them the truth. - But you need to come inside for at least two minutes to see my mom. Roy! - Amy, I need to go. - I'm sure you do. - Well, that's quite an outfit. - There's probably some big fashion designer story behind it, too. - Janet, darling. - Amy. - I came as soon as I could. I still can't believe Dad's dead. - Yeah. This is Oliver. - Thank you Oliver, and that one. I can't wait to see Mommy. - Is Roy coming in? - Of course Janet, he's just parking the car. - Charming. - Yeah, don't worry just leave it at the door. - [Mommy] Thank you, have some tea before you go. - Mommy. - Oh, Amy. - [Amy] I came as soon as I could. I took the first business class. - I'm so happy you're here. - What happened Mom? - Death is all around us. (muffled speaking) - You know, Pandit Ji, when my father came here from India, he couldn't even get into a home. My mother and I they really had to struggle, you know, to make ends meet. Sometimes I can't believe that the man I worked for, turned out to be the love of my life. - That happened to you. I mean like death is complicated. (muffled speaking) - Hi, I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you so much for coming. We appreciate it. Can you excuse us for a minute? - Okay. - Do you think you can tone it down, with the death talk? - Death is-- - All around us, yeah, we know, we get it. Kiara, Datha just died, please? Okay? Thank you. - You know my Gita never let me want for anything. Men like you and Gabriel, they're not easy to find today. - That is very true. - Missus Isaac, I'm so sorry for your loss. Condolences. - Thank you. Pandit Ji, this is Oliver, Janet's friend. - Actually Oliver. - Miss Janet, can I give you a hand with anything? - Pandit Ji, I'm just seeing someone who has come from India. I'll just go and greet them. - Okay. - I think we're fine, thanks. - Janet, can I give you a hand with anything? - I think we're good, thank you. Excuse us. - What was that all about? - I told you that guy is weird. - If I didn't know any better I'd think your mom was trying to set you up with him. - Can you imagine? Oh please, come on. I mean, besides I'm, I'm already taken, right? - But just get to tell your mother. - Oliver, you're still here? - Yeah. - So what now, he's moving in with us Saturday? Just asking. - No, I'm not moving in. - Thank you. - Nobody is moving in or out. - [Kiara] So, there's this lady outside. - [Janet] What lady? - I don't know, but she's kind of making a scene. - I'll be back. Can you help Oliver with the plates? (lady crying) - I can't believe he's gone. (crying) Oh why? Why? - [Janet Voiceover] This is my Dad's long lost sister Sheila. They haven't spoken to each other in 10 years. But, here she is. - Why, why, why, why did he leave me, my brother? Why why? - Control yourself. - Why did he leave me? - He was like a father to me. I miss him. - Where's Mel? She's bringing the bags. - Well aren't you gonna help her? - She'll manage. - Hey dog. - Hi. - [Minister] And so in death, we are all united. And now for Gabriel's granddaughter Kiara, to say a few words. - [Melissa] Where's Riki? - He's on his way, since yesterday. - My grandparents are the only ones who will truly understand this poem. To Datha. Death, the taker of life. It's so dark in here, so hard to breathe. I'm trying to get out, but I can't. Open this casket! I scream. But no one can hear me. Death, I fear you, sucking my life with every breath that I take. You pull me deeper and deeper away. I feel you all around us. In front of us, living with us, hiding under the bed, around the corner, in the shower. Or in a piece of cake. Just waiting, waiting, until the time is right. Death, you are the destiny of the living, the taker of life. You ruin everything! Death, who are you? - Daddy, I'm here. I'm here, Dad. I'm sorry. (mournful instrumental music) (singing in foreign language) - Well, well, well, I see the way of the Lord didn't last long with you. - Spare me the lecture, please. - What happened to your hand? - I was changing a tire. - Oh please. - How much do you think Dad left us, eh? - Wow, it's been six hours since we burnt Dad, and you're already talking about money. Typical Riki. - Everybody wants to know, but nobody's asking. - What's the rush? - [Riki] Why would I tell you? - Because, we're family, and that's what families do. You know Riki, you should really start telling me things. Janet and Melissa say nothing to me. - You know, I don't even blame them. - Okay, so how about this? I'll tell you something about me, and then you go. - Okay, so I'm working on a plan. - I'm leaving Roy. - God, geez. (laughing) You wouldn't go a day without your limousine, and people running after you, and your trips to Paris, and where else have you been? You're being serious. Oh my God. I'm sorry. - [Amy] Your turn. - Okay, we should sell this house. - That's your master plan? - It belongs to all of us, and it's worth about what, three, four, maybe even five million? Janet and Mel won't mind. - Wow. Who said they need to know now, brother? Hmm? And, we'll tell them when the time is right. - I mean it's been so long since we've all been together. I don't even know what to say to them. - You don't have to say anything. You just gotta be there for them. - [Janet] This is what Dad wanted. All his children together under one roof, and he's not here. - Well if anyone can handle this family, it's you. - Three days, right? And then they'll be out of here, how bad can it be. - So, you guys are still here. (muffled whispering) - I can hear anyway. - Okay. See you tomorrow. Amy, it's been a real pleasure. (light instrumental music) - Well Jan, he's quite a catch. Just make sure he's got his own money. Otherwise he'll be moving in here to live off you and Mommy. See you in the morning. (light orchestral music) - Yeah, and the death certificate. Is that all you need? That's it. (doorbell ringing) Okay. How soon can you have this evaluation done? Hold on for me one second. Can somebody get the door please? Yeah. Yeah I'm looking to make a quick move out of here. Yeah, look my mom's not coping with all this. Memories, yeah. (doorbell ringing) There's too many of them. Yeah tomorrow, tomorrow sounds great. What time? (doorbell ringing) Okay that's great, 10 o'clock it is. All right, thank you thank you, bye. (doorbell ringing) Somebody get the door, please. (doorbell ringing) Okay, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. (doorbell ringing) I'm coming, I'm coming. (tense jazz music) Who the hell are you? - Oh hello. - Yes? - I am Pandit Ji Jay. - Look, we don't have any money to give you, donations, I'm really sorry. - No, it's okay, don't be sorry. Is Miss Janet here? - No, she's not here. Why do you want to see Janet? - Just wanted to check up on her, how is she doing? - For what? - You're very inquisitive. Your father. - Yes, he's dead. - Yes, I'm well aware. I brought his ashes. - Oh, thank you for bringing that. - I also have this box. Oh look. - What's this for? - If it is the key to my heart, will you give it to Janet? - Thanks for coming, I really appreciate it. - But no. - I think maybe we should donate Dad's coats, what do you think? - No. - Mommy, you have to decide at some point. - No one is touching his books, his clothes, or anything that belonged to him. Okay? - So you just want to keep his stuff around, like he's still alive? - Maybe. - Maybe after a year, hmm? - Maybe. - What are you reading? - You're not the only one who's a writer in the family, Janet. Your father used to write me the most lustful poems when he was in the navy. - Oh Mommy, please stop. No, I can't. - Nowadays, it's just LOL's in texting. - You know about that? (laughing) Are we allowed to know? - What else can we do, darling? The man's dead. And he isn't coming back. What are you looking at? - Look at Dad. - Show me. Your father loved the ocean. You know, maybe, maybe we should spread his ashes there. - Dad would love that. - I think so. - But, we must check with Riki first, before we decide. - Morning. Good morning. Morning, Mommy. - Morning. - You're awake? - Yes I am with very bad jet lag. I suppose none of you heard the phone ringing? Sheila woke me up. - What did she want? - She's coming over for dinner tonight. What are you guys doing awake so early? - We're deciding what to do with Dad's coats, and the ashes. - Don't people just throw it into the ocean? - Kind of more like gentle spreading. - But we have wait for Riki. - I agree. - You do? - He's our brother, we should wait for him. - Okay. - So Roy didn't want to come for your father's funeral. - It's not that he didn't want to come, Mommy. You know he's got important business to deal with in Paris, and he couldn't just leave. - Oh, I thought you guys got the first business class tickets out of there. - But I saw Roy, last night. - No you didn't. It's just me, Mommy. - Okay, so what were you doing in Paris, anyway? - I thought you guys would never ask. So, we went to a fertility clinic, 'cause we're ready to have a baby. - Oh wow, that's awesome. - [Amy] I know, right? - Amy, you really think a baby's gonna save your marriage? - Mom, you faith in my marriage really makes me feel supported. - Amy. - Mommy, look there's three of us here. Why can't you pick on Melissa or Janet? I'm the one dealing with the baby issue right now, and my father just died. Look, you'll be happy to know that the procedure didn't work. But that doesn't mean we should stop trying. I'm ready to be a mom. I know I didn't want kids at first, but I think if I can get the kid to fit into my life, that a nanny or two, we'd have to get a nanny, it would work out. I have no idea how you do it, Melissa. Janet, you've got Mom, so. - I see you're off your leash. Where's your chaperone? - Probably with Oliver. We're all going to die at some point. Might as well. (muffled speaking) - You'll get used to it. This guy has been texting me all day, and my fiance would be so upset. If he found out he'd be dying in a heartbeat. - I didn't know you were getting married. - It's complicated, his wife's a bitch. - So you're waiting for this man to leave his wife, and marry you? What if he doesn't? - He will. And if he found out about Joey. - Who is Joey? - The guy from the mechanic shop. Look at those muscles. I could totally do him, if you know what I mean. You know I've been talking about you and meeting me. He wants to take us out tomorrow night. - There is no way I can leave this house at night, especially with you. - Why? Just go to your mommy. - No. - It's gonna be super-chill with some of his friends. We'll be back before anyone knows we've gone. - You do know, my mother's not the boss of me. I can go if I want to. - That's my girl. You're gonna wake up one day, and realized that you've listened to your mother your whole life, trust me, I know. Till later, babe. (upbeat jazz music) (car starting) (phone ringing) (cheering) - Family dinner, this is more like a family disaster. I mean Sheila was the one who wanted to have the dinner, then she canceled. Riki didn't even bother to show up. Melissa was stuck with the kids, again, and Amy well. - I still don't understand why Sheila wouldn't want to speak to her only brother. - Okay, so the story is, my Mom worked as a teener in my Dad's house. And then they fell in love. And Sheila thought my mother was a gold digger, she wasn't good enough for my Dad. Then my grandparents died, and Sheila ran off with the inheritance, hers and my Dad's, and we never heard from her again, until last night. You know, it's amazing that my parents kept it together this whole time. They actually had a happy marriage. Can't say the same for Riki, or Amy, or Melissa. - Maybe that's why you're scared to marry me. - What? - Are you scared of being just like them? - Don't be ridiculous. I mean, I'm not like them, you are definitely not like their spouses. - I wouldn't know. I don't know any of them. - And you don't need to know, as long as you know the people that matter, like Kiara. - She hates me. - Come on, she's just being a teenager. My Mom likes you. - Not so much. - She's a little bit overprotective. - I know your Dad liked me. And from what I did know about him, he was a kind, loving, gentle person. Just like you. (gentle orchestral music) (in foreign language) - Have you read any of my books? - I think (mumbling). - Please, can you sign ma'am? Right here. - Sure. Thank you. - I can now Janet, I can read a few pages. - Amy. (in foreign language) - And you're going out again? Let me guess, my sister's babying your kids right now. - You wouldn't understand, you don't have kids. Sorry, can't have kids. Don't wait up for me. - Is she even wearing any pants? - [Amy] Who knows? - What's that? - Another erotic novel by your sister. - Can you forget about that now? The agent's coming in today. - That was quick. - Exactly. - Can you tell me, what time are they coming? - Good morning. - Morning Mom. - Take me to the temple. - Yeah. - Mommy, you've never been to the temple before, why are you going now? - I've never been a widow either before, Amy. Shall we. - Wait for me. - [Melissa] I just feel like sometimes I need a day off. Children are hard work. - [Janet] Not as hard as marriage. - So lucky being Ben's dead. - What does that mean? - I don't mean it like that, I mean in a good way. At least you don't have to answer for every simple thing that you do. - Yeah, well, I have Mom for that. (laughing) - Oh, Mom. - Seriously though, you're married and you're unhappy. Is that what marriage is about? You marry the person you truly love only to end up hating each other for the rest of your lives? - No, it's exactly what it is like for me. Just when you decide to start thinking about yourself, then you have the children, and the grandchildren, the dogs, the house. It just gets bigger and bigger. - Melissa, you don't need anything from him. Why don't you just leave? (sorrowful piano music) - And why don't you just marry Oliver? - Who says I want to get married? - Well, do you? (kids laughing) - Hey, hey boys. (laughing) (muffled speaking) - You have the most beautiful family home, here. We won't have any trouble selling it. - Oh good, the sooner the better. - Just a few background checks, and then we're good to go. - Hey Roy, you made it. - Riki. - Hi. I'll walk you out. Thanks for coming. - Thank you sir, nice, lovely meeting you. - I thought you could use some of this stuff. - I was gonna pick it up tomorrow. - Clare is staying at the house. - First she takes my husband and now my house? - This is what we want. - No Roy, it's what you want. What about me? What about what I want? - Amy, it's always been about you. - How old is she? - It doesn't matter. - Yes, it matters. I'm 10 years younger, so what is she, 15, 20 years younger? Who the fuck knows? - Amy! - You know, I'm the one who suggested we do this baby thing. People have problems in their marriages, they start a family, have a kid, and the problems get ironed out. - You think a baby is gonna fix everything. A baby can't fix us. I'll send the rest of your things over. - Wait. How long have you been with her? Roy, are you deaf? Can you answer the question, how long have you been with her? - Three, four years maybe. - Get out. I said, get out, don't you have Clare to go to? Can you just leave? Some big brother you are, standing there and doing absolutely nothing about this. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. You needed to get that off your chest, all right? I wanted to deck him as much as you did. Calm down. Forget about Roy. Okay? Keep your eye on the prize, stay focused. We both need this, we need this now. Get it? So let's do this, come on. - Slowly sweetheart. Slowly. - No, not that I know of. I think she would have told me if she was gonna sell the house. - [Woman On Phone] Well, I got a call from an estate agent this morning inquiring about your father's beneficiaries, and the sale of the house. Your father left special instructions in a case like this. Do you know-- - I'll get back to you. Kiara, listen it's not what you think. - Really Mom, then what is this? I thought you were not gonna replace Dad. - Kiara, wait. Kiara? Kiara. Kiara, please wait. Mom? Mommy? Mom? Have you guys seen Mom? - She's somewhere in this big house, Jan. - I saw Roy again, driving out. - He just arrived this morning to see Mommy. But you know how busy he is, so he left. - So exhausted. Finally, have some time for myself. - So I got the strangest call from Dad's lawyer. - [Melissa] And, what did he want? - Looks like Mom's trying to sell the house. He said an agent called him. - [Melissa] Why would she sell the house? - [Janet] No idea. - Wait, wait. I made the call. - Hmm. - To the estate agent. - You made the call? - Look, we need to sell this house, before we all part ways again, anyway. - Oh my God, you're not even joking. - Look, we all need our fair share. Truthfully speaking, I can't pay you back until we get the money. - It's no reason to sell the house for that. - I mean, it's not such a bad idea. - It's not a bad idea at all. - It's a terrible idea. - Why, we all come out with something, including Mommy. - [Riki] Look the house is worth what, about five million? - The agent that houses like this sell fast. - So that's what the two of you have been up to? Meeting with agents and trying to sell our house. - Yes Janet, you're the only one that can turn spending time with my brother into a scheming moment. - Oh geez, come on, we don't even have half a relationship with him, or each other. - Okay, that's enough guys, come on. Let's stop fighting over this. - You know, I don't even understand. Why are you so upset? - Because you're trying to sell our house. - Janet, you need to stop thinking about yourself for a minute, and we need to start thinking as a unit, as a family. - What if you bought the house, Janet? - What? - That's a great idea. Remove the red tape. And besides, Oliver is a surgeon. I'm sure he can afford to buy this place from us. - Oliver. Why would Oliver want to buy this house? - Come on, Janet. I saw the ring. - You went through my stuff? - Hey, congrats, baby girl. - Don't you, don't you 'baby girl' me. Did either of you tell Mom about this? - Tell me what? - Riki and Amy. - Mommy, we will always think for you. Janet is getting married. - Amy! - You're getting married? To who? - Oliver, of course. He's been lurking around here since we arrived. - Mommy, I am not getting married. That's ridiculous. I mean, even if it was an option, I'm not considering that. Why would I want to get married? It doesn't make any sense at all. - So just to make it clear, you're not getting married then? - No, I'm definitely not getting married. Are you happy? - Oh, Oliver. (sad piano music) - [Mother] See, you guys are making a big deal out of nothing. Janet, would never leave me alone. (upbeat jazz music) - Come, come. It's only money. - Wait for me, please. This watch, this is a new digital, okay? It's a lot of money. (upbeat jazz music) - Candice? Candice? - [Candice] What? - I think we should go. - What's going on? - Candice, I think we should go now. - What do you mean? (Kiara muffled speaking) - So, you like him. - Candice. I think we should go now. - [Man] Bring her on in here. - Come inside. Come inside, come come come come come. - Hello, beautiful. - She has gorgeous hair. - Cutie pie. - Give it her. You ought try some, it's really amazing, you'll love it, all of it. - Candice, we don't. - [Man] Relax, don't worry. Everything is gonna be just fine, you'll see. - God damn! (giggling) (laughing) (ominous music) - Go call an ambulance! (dark electronic music) She going to be okay? - She'll be fine. Called in time. - Oliver, thank you, for coming for me. - I knew deep down you liked me. So how's this goth phase working out for you? - It's terrible. I have been joking about death, all this time. Always staring right at you. It's not funny at all. - It'll be okay. We're in this together. - Kiara? - Where is she? - Just down the hall to the right. - [Janet] Are you okay? - [Kiara] I'm sorry, Mom. - [Janet] You're grounded, for life. - I know. - Kiara Isaac? - What's wrong? - Nothing to worry about, we just need to make sure she's fine. - Yeah, but she didn't take anything. Did you? (Kiara muffled speaking) - Just precautionary. - Thank you for being there for her. I don't think I can handle losing another person in my life. I mean what was she thinking? How did she even get there? I, I didn't even know that she was gone. - Yeah, she made a mistake going there. But you need to give her more credit, because she saved Candice's life. - I should go check on her. (somber instrumental music) (retching and coughing) - [Candice] I can do it myself. - You could have died, Candice. And what the hell were you thinking, taking Kiara with you, huh? - Don't be so dramatic, everyone's alive. - So what, my being grateful my daughter's alive, makes me dramatic? - [Candice] I thought you didn't care. - Why wouldn't I care? Your children need you. - So you're happy I'm alive because I'm a mother? - Do you want the boys to grow up around your father? - You didn't seem to mind me growing up around him. - Well, look at how well that turned out. - Why are you even here? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetie. - So you're sorry? - I'm just grateful my daughter's alive. - If I need you, why didn't you leave him? He treats you so badly. - It wasn't always like that. - I grew up thinking this is how relationships are supposed to be. - It is not how relationships are supposed to be. He used to love me, one time you know. I was his entire world. Then suddenly, one day I came home and it was different. I waited till I, I waited for things to be different, or to change, and one day then I left him. I did. - But you were pregnant with me. - Well, that's not why I came back. He came back, he apologized, he said he'd change, and wanted us to be a family. It was good for a while. I was so in love with him, Candice. I was. It's so hard really, when you have kids. And you make me a mother to your kids, how can I? - I know I'm a shitty mom. - I know too. But we're gonna try hard. Together. (phone buzzing) - Yes, Riki? - Janet? Jan. - Oh my word, are you drunk? - Just a little drunk. - Where the hell have you been? - You remember the time you broke Dad's typewriter? - What? - He sent you to the (mumbling). I couldn't see you go there alone, Jan. I came with you. I was there with you for hours, remember that? Me and you. Where was Mel and Amy, hmm? They were nowhere. Watching TV or something. - Hey Riki, listen. - Look, but that's the time, that's the time me and you, we made a bond and a pact. That we'll always be there for each other. Well I need you now. I need you now, more than ever Jan. I'm alone. I'm in a corner, and I'm alone. I got nobody, Jan, nobody. - What's going on? Where are you? - I need 100,000 rands. - What? - I messed up, Jan. - Are you insane? Where do you expect me to get that kind of money? - I messed up and I, I'm sorry. And so everything was going so well and then. - You know what, you have to stop this, you've got to stop doing what you're doing. - You can have my share of the house. I'll give it to you. Promise. Just help me this once, I'm begging you. I'm begging you Jan, just this once, please. I don't have anybody else. - Okay, sober up, and come home. - I'll pay you back every cent. I promise you, I promise you that. (solemn electronic music) - Melissa, we've been here for a while now. How much longer are you gonna be? - Hey, nobody asked you to be here. - You know Jan, I'm out of here, I have things to do. - Amy, just sit down. - Mom? How's Candice? - What the hell happened to you? - It's nothing. - It's all right, he's just tired. - Come, sit Riki. - [Mother] Come darling. - So, what's going on? - You tell us. Why do you need 100K? - Why would I need 100K? Look, I've got 50,000 here, right now, and I know Mom has money in the house. You just need to admit you have a problem. - Janet, everyone's got a problem but you. - I ask you for one favor. And now I have a problem? - Yes, you do have a problem. You're a gambling addict, you're always drinking, you're a compulsive liar. I mean, come on. We all know the church stuff is just a big front. - Come on, I had a few drinks. Excuse me, my father just died. - Riki, you have to get help. You need to check in to some rehab facility. - He doesn't need rehab, Janet. - Mommy, why are you always defending him? Even when he's wrong? - Is he drunk now? - I don't know, are you drunk now? - No, I am not drunk. - There, you see? He's trying his best, and you keep pestering him all the time about his drinking, his gambling, and what do you want me to do? You want me to kick my only son out, that he never comes home again? - He's kicking you out. - What? - Yes, Amy and Riki went behind your back. - Why do you always have to gang up on us? - They went behind all our backs to try and sell this house. - Janet's always so dramatic. - What do you even need the money from this house? Don't you have enough? - Not anymore. She's leaving Roy. - I'm not leaving Roy, you're such a traitor. - You're getting divorced? - I'm not getting divorced. Why are you listening to Riki, he's drunk. You're drunk, you're drunk. - Riki, you want to sell this house? - Mommy, look it's really big. And we need your help with this. - No Riki, you can't sell the house. - Why not? Dad would want everybody to have. - No, no. Dad would definitely not want us to sell the house. - You don't know what your father wanted. Listen to me. We need our shares. - Everybody needs this. - No I'm sorry Riki, this is not what your father and I wanted. We wanted to give this house to Janet. - What? Why does she only get a share of it. - Why are you all so surprised? She's the one who deserves it, she's the one who's been here for us, while all of you have been off leading your own lives. - It's true, Mommy. - Janet, and Oliver, they're the ones who've been here for us, who cared for us, who were here when we needed them, when we were in trouble. Where were you guys? You were never here. You just called us when you needed money. And Amy, Amy was very happy being a trophy wife. And you darling, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but you've just been busy getting abused by that husband of yours. - Old lady, shut your mouth. You don't know what you're talking about. - You watch how you talk to my mother. - Calvin. (confused yelling) - [Calvin] Let go of me. - [Riki] You will have respect for my mother. (confused yelling) - Daddy! - [Mother] Stop fighting! - [Amy] Mommy. - Go away. - [Janet] Let me help you. - Just go away, Janet. - [Riki] Mom. - Get out. Get out, he's dead, he's gone. Can you not show him some respect? - Mom. - Get out. All of you. Just get out. - I'm glad Dad is not alive to see us behave like this. - I don't want to die. - No one's gonna die. - Or get kidnapped. You know they'll take me first. - Oh please, you'll probably talk them to death anyway. - Maybe they should just take you away so we can move on with our lives. - You know, I'm not comfortable putting my life in danger for Riki. We should just let them take him. - Amy. - What? - You're unbelievable. - You're on his side when it suits you, otherwise you're happy to throw him to the wolves and let him die. He's our brother for goodness sake. - Okay, do you want to die? - No one is gonna die. What is your problem anyway? Why don't you just go back home to Roy and forget about us like you always do? - I don't have a home to go to. - So you are getting divorced? - Yes, I'm sure that makes you happy. - Why would that make me happy? - Because now you're not the only miserable one. - [Babes] Missus Isaac, I heard about your husband. My condolences. - [Mother] Does your mother know what you do for a living? - It's a family business, ma'am. - So this is my family business. - [Riki] Mom? - And you, you put my life and your sisters' lives in danger, when you let this happen in our house. - I'm sorry Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't know they'd come to our house. Is that the key to the safe? - I take it that you tried to get into the safe? - It wasn't like that. - It wasn't like what, Riki? - Missus Isaac. - I am talking to my son. - I'm sorry, I messed up Mom, I messed up. Okay, I'm sorry about Dad. I'm sorry about Babes. I'm sorry about everything, okay? - So what happens now? - Nothing, I take the money, I go. - Oh, just like that? - Just like that. It's not the movies, ma. - Babes, you broke my nose. - Which one of you broke his hand? Break his other one. - What, no, come on! - It's a bit harsh, Missus Isaac. - [Riki] It is a bit harsh! - I've got my money. - He says he doesn't need rehab. He says he can stop gambling. He says, hey says, he says. - Mom, I will do anything you want. Please, come on. - You see, better. - Babes, if you ever come back to this house, or you loan Riki money again, I am gonna kill you myself. I have nothing to lose, my husband is dead, and I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in jail. Got it? - Yes, ma'am. - Come on, please. - Use the door, and don't leave any stains. - Mommy, Mommy please! - I could have told you guys your lives would end up like this. But here I am, and my own life is falling apart. I just destroyed the perfect relationship with Oliver. And it's you guys, you know? You just, you make me go insane. Everything becomes about you and your issues, and your families, and then there's Mom, and she thinks she knows what I want, what makes me happy. And I'm just trying to fit into everything. I mean, what I have with, what I had with Oliver is, it's nothing like what you guys have. He truly loves me. Unconditionally. I have to go. - You can't leave now, boss's orders. - I have to try and get him back. - Sit down. - Please? Thank you. - You let her go? (sentimental instrumental music) - Oliver, yes, I love you. Yes, I want to marry you. - [Oliver] Janet stop, what are you doing in here? - I love you, Oliver, I really love you. I'm here. - You can't be in here, just wait outside. I'm sorry. (somber instrumental music) - Hey I'm sorry about earlier. And I know I said that in front of everyone, you're probably embarrassed. - Janet you just burst into a 12-hour surgery with no regard for what I was doing or for my patient's life. - I know, I wasn't thinking. I just got carried away with all the emotion. I just had to tell you. I want to marry you. - You've been avoiding me since I asked you to marry me. Even before your father died. You could have spoken to me about it. Instead, you waited for your whole family to be there to say no. - It wasn't supposed to happen. Tomorrow after we scatter the ashes, they'll be gone and then we can get back to our lives the way it used to be. It's my family, Oliver. They get me all flustered and I can't think straight. That's what they do to me. - It's not your family Janet, it's you. You're so scared everything will fall apart if you don't have control over it. You try and create this perfect life where you don't disappoint anyone. There's no room for me. There's no room for us. (sad piano music) (crickets chirping) - You saw your brother hit me and you did nothing. He's put all our lives in danger over here. We need to get away from these people. - These people are my family. - Your family doesn't think much of you. There's nothing here for you. Your mother is not going to sell this house. We need to get away from here. - Candice is still in the hospital. The kids are scared. - You know what, she should have just died, and done us all a favor. - Calvin. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to say we'll do what's best for our child. - Yeah, let's go and get her and get the fuck out of here. - No. She's gonna stay right her with the kids, with my Mom. And me. - What? - [Melissa] It's gonna be good for her. - Oh you know what's good for her? You don't even know what's good for yourself. - Your right, I don't. Because you've been doing that for me my entire life. But this time, this time she's gonna stay right here until I decide what's good for all our lives. I can't do this anymore, Cal. - What do you think? You think you're the only person that hates your life? - If we hate our lives so much then why do we stay together? And why are we dragging the kids through this? - You know what, I can live without you. I can live without your family. I don't need any of you. But you know what, she's not even my daughter, and I've been taking care of-- - She is your daughter. She is your daughter, you just don't want to know what's true. - You know what's true? What's true is you've been sleeping around, and making the problem of other men in my problem, because you're a fucking slut, that's what you are. You will come back. You always come back. (sad piano music) - Mommy? - Amy? Come here baby. Come. Come here. - Mommy? - Hmm? - Can I move back home? You were right about him. He never truly loved me. And I knew it every time I fought with you, and I always blamed you. I know that you and Daddy only ever wanted the best for me. And now he's gone and I'm never going to be able to tell him how sorry I am. - No, you don't have to be sorry. Baby, your father knew how much you loved him. - Did he? - Of course he did. - You know, I am so proud of you. - Why would you be? I am the biggest failure. - No you're not. But you would have been, if your plan had worked. - What plan? - If you'd had a baby, just to hang on to him, to keep him, you understand? - Mm-hmm. - Come here. (sentimental instrumental music) (birds singing) - I love you Daddy. - Just come here baby, it's okay. It's okay, it's just about over. (introspective piano music) - You didn't think I'd miss today. - How'd you know the time. - I called Kiara. - So you guys, you're good friends now? - Sort of. - You were right. I was trying to create this perfect life for myself, where I was in control of everything. Somehow in all of that, I lost myself, and you. I really did want to marry you. - You know it wasn't all about the marriage. I woke up this morning and I realized the one thing missing was you. Whether we get married or not doesn't matter, as long as we're together. You, Kiara and I, somehow, we're a family. - I'm a single mom, with a scary teenager, and a weirdly intrusive family. - I love your crazy family. (laughing) - No, you don't. - I'll take it. (sentimental piano music) - Riki, Amy. Where are you people, it's so late, come on. Hurry up. Melissa? Where are the children? Why are you guys taking so long? Come on, come on, come on, hurry up. No no no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Come on, come on. Come on, darling, come on. Come on, where's Janet? Janet? Janet. Has no one called her? - Mom says she's not up there. - What? - [Mommy] Nothing, you look different. Now, come on. - Don't get used to it. - I'm not. Come on, hurry up. Where's the tray? Who's taking the tray? You're taking the tray. (dramatic orchestral music) (singing in foreign language) - Come on, we have to go. We have to go, they're gonna ruin everything that happened here. Come on Oliver, get up, we have to go! - Where do you want to go? We have to scatter the ashes with them. - Hey, you guys are early. - [Janet] No we're not. - Missus Isaac. Kiki. - Kiki? - Oliver, you're here? - Yes Mom, and I want him to stay. - Okay, I want him to stay too. Darling, I know I haven't acknowledged your relationship but, I do realize how much you care for each other. Besides, I like having him around. (laughing) I think I'll let him stay. Come on, let's go now. (soft instrumental music) (light orchestral music) - [Janet Voiceover] Who knew that losing my Dad would be the reason my crazy family found their way back to each other? Yes, we're a bit strange, some of us more than others. So what? Families are messy. The best we can do is love each other, no matter what.
