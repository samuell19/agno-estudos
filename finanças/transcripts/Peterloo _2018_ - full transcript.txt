Subtitles by explosiveskull The Prime Minister. My Lords, I believe it unnecessary long to occupy the attention of the House upon the subject of the motion which I am about to submit. I am called upon by His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, to propose a measure calculated farther to commemorate the glory of the Duke of Wellington. Hear, hear. After such an heroic action as that of the 18th of June, after a victory which presented a display of all the great qualities of a general - whether for defensive or offensive warfare, whether for resistance or attack, whether for gallantry, perseverance, or skill - I would ask whether, after a victory unparalleled in history, Parliament could be conceived to do its duty, if it merely confined itself to a vote of thanks, and declined to present any further evidence of public gratitude to the valiant leader of such a signal victory... if it refused to make an adequate provision for this celebrated conqueror and his family. I move a resolution that this House grant to His Grace, the Duke of Wellington, as farther proof of the gratitude of the British nation... the sum of £750,000. - Hear, hear! - Hear, hear! General Byng, sir, Lord Sidmouth is now at liberty erm... Oh, beware the step, sir, yes. Enter. Er... Er... G-General Byng, Your Lordship. Sir John. - Home Secretary. - Welcome, sir. Pray, do be seated. I thank you. Let me see... Yes, your father. I trust he is in good health? Sadly not, sir. Yes. No, please, do forgive me. I did so enjoy his company - despite our differing opinions. - Splendid fellow. - Thank you, sir. It is a great honour to be in your presence. The honour is all mine, Your Lordship. Your achievements have been nothing short of... Olympic. You flatter me, sir. Enter. Good morning, Your Lordship. Good morning, sir. Would you care for some tea, sir? - No, thank you, madam. - Oh. And how are you feeling today, Lord Sidmouth? Much better, thank you, Mrs Moss. I'm so very pleased to hear it. There we are. Thank you, gentlemen. I must own, Your Lordship, that my knowledge of life is limited beyond that of a soldier. And... you'll forgive me for saying, but I have little time for politics. Excellent, sir. I have little time for politics myself. You, sir, are... ..perfectly qualified, if I may say so. Might I ask how I may be of service? I would wish to appoint you Commander of the Northern District. The Northern District? Not Ireland? - No, sir, not Ireland. - I see. Might you be familiar with the North of England? Barely, sir. My late mother was Yorkshire. Her family seat was Wentworth Castle. Wellington has nothing but the highest praise for your achievements. Thank you, sir. I had the great privilege of serving alongside His Grace on many a campaign. Yorkshire is indeed a splendid county. However, on the other side of the Pennine Hills... ..in Manchester... and the surrounding towns of Lancashire, there is a sickness. A dangerous threat of rampant insurrection. Indeed, sir. Enter. Ah, Hobhouse. General Sir John Byng, Mr Hobhouse, my permanent under-secretary. It is a great honour to meet you, Sir John. Now, Hobhouse, henceforth Sir John is to enjoy full access to all files concerning seditious activity in the North. - Excellent. - Am I to understand that you wish me to commence forthwith? Indeed we do. - Very well, sir. - Splendid. Is this the way to Manchester? Aye, you're on t'right track, lad. - Just keep going. - Thanking you. Joseph! Come on, Son. Let's sit thee down. Come on. Come on. What's this? Let's get this off you. Come on, Son. There we go. Come on. Come on, Son. Come on, get this down you. Come on, Son. Hey, now - no skriking. Come on. Hey, come on. Mother's here. Eh? Mother's here. Now, Son. He were bleeding. - Right, Aggie? - All right, Father? It were streaming down his face. - Were it? - Aye. He deserved it, though. He's been late three times this week. Aye, he were bleeding. A right mess. He's wiped out. He gave me the fright of me life. - Did he say owt? - No, not a whistle. - He's not changed, then! - Aye. - Uh-uh! - Leave it, lad! - George! - No, no, no. Now, let's put that out of harm's way. Sit still for a minute. We'll be going for us tea soon, lad. 'Ey, we've woken him up now. Joe? We're all here. Come on, let's sit thee up. - Are you hungry, Joseph? - I've done you some broth. - You 'right, Father? - Aye, lad. Sit thee down, Father. Sit down, Son. - Esther? - Aye. Get me a spoon. Now, mind - it's hot. Here y'are. - It's George. - Aye, he's got big. Ooh, you can say that again. He has. It's a baby. Aye, little Sarah. Your niece. There's your Uncle Joseph. You 'right? What were t'fighting like, Joe? Was you at Waterloo? - Ah... - Leave him, Robert. Aye, he'll be 'reet. Did you see Boney? Oh, come on, up you get, you daft barmpot! - Night, Father. - Good night. - Good night, George. - Good night, Grandfather. See thee tomorrow, Joe. Glad you're back, Joseph. See thee in t'morn'. - In t'morn'. - See thee, clever-clogs! - See thee. - See thee. Penny a pie! 'Alf for an a'penny! Fresh this morn! Ladies? Mister? Penny a pie! 'Alf for an a'penny! Penny a pie, mister? Half for an a'penny! Fresh this morn! Penny a pie, ladies! 'Alf for an a'penny! - Fresh this morn! - Nell! Nell! I'll have 'alf. - There. Ha'penny. - Right, love. Coming out. Here it is. Fresh eggs! Farthing an egg! Penny farthing, half dozen. 'Ey up, Nellie, y'all right? Aye. How's thee sen? - Oh, you know. - Oh, aye. - You havin' t'usual? - Aye. - Any word? - He's come home. - No? - He has. Ee, that's grand! How is he? - He's not his sen. - No. I'll give you an extra one. Make him summat special for his supper. Thank you. Here's your pie. Aye, that's grand. - See thee. - Aye. Fresh eggs! Farthing an egg!

Sorry, lad. Any work? I went t' t'other side of t'canal. But there were nowt going. There is nowt going. There's talk of them cutting wages again next month. - Cutting them to what? - To the bone, Mother. Aye, and that bread tax is helping no one. - It's helping someone. - Who? - Them rich beggars. - Bastard farmers. It's not just t'farmers' fault, Robert. - How d'you mean? - It's t'government, Mary. Government? Landowners have got t'government in their pockets. Besides, most of t'government are landowners themselves! Getting fat on land that they stole from us in t'first place. Oh, aye. What's that to do with t'price of bread? They have a bad harvest, there's a shortage of corn. They won't let them import any from France or America or anywhere, so they force prices up and us poor souls end up paying five times more for a loaf of bread. - Is that t'Corn Laws? - It is. They were meant to help us but it just made things worse. When has a government ever done anything to help us? True. Fat leeches, down London. They'll starve us all to death. Elevenpence ha'penny.

Now, as for the felony, to whit, the theft of two bottles of excellent claret, before I pass sentence, indulge my curiosity, Mrs Micklethwaite, and inform me, what erroneous pretext compelled you to descend into the cellar in the first place. I were up in th'attic and I saw this ghost, looking at me. And I 'ad to run down to t'cellar - honest! Indeed! So, afeared of the spirit in the attic, you partook of the spirit in the cellar. Oh... Given the dual nature of your crime, I am minded to pass this case upward to the Quarter Sessions, with the recommendation that you spend the next seven years contemplating your sins overlooking the exotic vista of Botany Bay. No, sir! No! I've got a lad at home what needs me! Silence! I am reluctant to impose upon the Crown the cost of your transportation. Therefore, you shall be whipped... No, sir, no! Please, sir! ..that it may shame you and deter others. You may then spend the next 14 days in gaol, in quiet contemplation of your crimes. Take her down. Edward Wild. For what purpose were you in the vicinity of Tib Street, Manchester, on the third day of November last? We was knocking down a wall. - Why? What are you? - A labourer. Oh. Were you in liquor? No, sir. Then perhaps you might explain to me what occasioned you to enter a haberdasher's shop - on the day in question. - It's my pocket watch, sir. It is not your pocket watch. It is a silver pocket watch, valued at five guineas. It is the property of the haberdasher, Mr Arnold. Furthermore, his name is quite clearly inscribed upon the reverse side of the case back. I won it on a game of dice. - Where? - The Old Boar's Head. When? I can't remember, s-sir. You are wasting the time of this court. I am to recommend that you be transported to the territory of Australia for a period of 14 years. Our Lord God owns everything upon this earth, and when you steal, you rob from him. - You are James Mahon? - Yes. Remove your hat. - Wha'? - You are in a court of law. You are charged with stealing a coat from your master. No. No, I didn't steal it. I took it. Explain to me the difference. He had two, I needed one. He's got one. I've got one. I was cold. - Are you an Englishman? - Yes, sir. Do you know your Bible? Can you read? "Thou shalt not steal." God's Commandment, number eight. I'm a reformer. - A reformer? - Yes. That gives you the right to steal? No, it's not stealing. It's sharing. What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine. - Is that the coat? - Yes. Take it off. Remove that coat. Have it. I shall commit you to the Quarter Sessions. I shall recommend that you be hanged. Take him down. Hanged? Over a coat? Find out where he lives. It is our profound belief that we are on the brink of the dawn of liberty. We are on the verge of achieving elevation from the cesspits and swamps in which our government would have us dwell. We shan't be denied any longer. The government's defences are creaking. The water is rising. The dam is breaking. The foam it swells, it swells all around them. The gilded reptiles are unable to overawe this expression of public opinion. These apish Jupiters... Hear, hear! ..the phantasmagoria of prophets who sit fat and idle in that infernal monster pit they call Parliament, are quaking in their boots. Aye! Let the friends of radical reform but persevere. Let us be firm and fear not that victory will be ours. Our enemies will shrink before the voice of all powerful truth. When the pimps of authority deny a man suffrage, they rob him of all security for his life, liberty and property. What kind of people are they to commit such atrocities? Friends, I urge you one and all to go home to your families and tell them to join us, hand and heart. Tell them: courage is a kind of salvation. Tell them: we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Aye! Every citizen must answer the call. For we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark. The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. Aye, well said, John. Well said, John Saxton! Hear, hear. - Into the light! - Yes. Gentlemen... I have long and deeply... felt for the labouring class. And it is this feeling alone which induces me to promote constitutional reformation of the representation of the people in the House of Commons. - Aye. - Hear, hear. For believe me when I say that the distress of the people is too great to be removed by any power other than that of Parliament. - Aye! - True! The object of Parliament ought to be the general good, the equal protection, the security of the person and property of each individual. - Yes. - That is right. Therefore labour, the poor man's only property, ought to be as sacred as any other property. Aye! I deem it proper to inform you, that a few weeks ago, the few gentlemen from Manchester, who have, luckily for us, better understandings and a superior degree of human feeling, presented a requisition to the borough reeve and constables, requesting them to call an open meeting to consider petitioning the House of Commons to repeal all the laws which restrain the importation of corn or grain. - Aye! Hear, hear. - With this requisition, the borough reeve and constables refused to comply... - Shame! - Bastards! - Shameful. - Bastards! Nor is this all, gentlemen. If any individual has at any time attempted to represent to the inhabitants of our town and neighbourhood, the enormous burthens imposed upon them by the government, or taken any steps to prevent the imposition of new, or to remove any old burthens, they have uniformly vilified and calumniated them in the most scandalous and shameful degree. Aye. And, not content with this, they have, as is well known, caused great numbers to be thrown into prison... - That is right. - ..and there endure every species of suffering their malignity could procure them. I, myself, gentlemen, have had the distinguished honour of being twice the object of their malignant vengeance, and enjoyed the indignity of a dungeon cell. 'Tis true! When the recent war was over, and the people expected plenty to have returned with peace, their distress became worse than ever, and it is the opinion of most thinking men that, at that juncture, the populace would then have fallen in violence upon their employers or their dealers in goods, or both, but for the views exhibited by the advocates of parliamentary reform. - 'Tis true. - Aye. The constitution of our country vests the right of electing members of the House of Commons in the people. Therefore, we must, openly, and in a manner and with language that is mild and constitutional, yet firm and clear... call for these reforms. The division of the population of the United Kingdom - into equal parts. - Aye! Those parts to equal the number of representatives. Aye! Each representative to be an inhabitant of the district he represents. Aye! Each man to be entitled to vote for his representative. - Aye. - Hear, hear. And Parliament to be elected annually. - Aye! - Hear, hear! Dr Joseph Healey, representing Oldham, Lancashire, heartily concurs! I thank you, Mr Healey. Samuel Bamford, township of Middleton. I would like to speak in support of my friend, - Mr Knight. - Thank you, Mr Bamford. We have seen with our own eyes the likes of these borough reeves and constables, who supposedly are there to protect our interests and to keep t'peace but in truth they turn a blind eye to t'transgressions and iniquities that blight all our lives. True, Sam. True. All the while feathering their own nests and hindering the common man. And what is our national Parliament but t'same affliction on a grander scale? Aye. The sooner we can represent ourselves in all matters of local and national interest, the sooner we can return to our work with dignity! Aye! We must expose the corrupters, shine a light on their treachery once and for all. - Aye! - Aye, John, aye. Hear, hear! Hear, hear, John! Hear, hear! - You all right, love? - Oh, aye. So... what's to be done to save the world, eh? They said we have to be ready. - What for? - For things to change. How d'you mean? That's what they said, didn't they? Aye, Father. They said we have to spread the word. But what did they talk about? About having a voice. Er... representation. Hmm. Talk, talk, talk. - No, no, he means the vote. - We know he means the vote but what's to be done to get the vote? What's to be done is what they was doing... Shh... ..what they was doing tonight. People meeting, talking, being strong together. All right, keep your hair on. I were just saying. Less talk, more action. Come on, George. Come on, wake up. Any road, they'll never give us t'vote. They'll give us nowt by that way of thinking, Nellie. These folk think we stand a chance, Mam. - And who are these folk? - From all over. - Working men? - Oh, aye. - I'll go and see how she is. - Come on, lad. Good night, George. - See thee tomorrow. - Good night, love. The men, women and children who keep the relentless grinding of the wheels of industry turning and spinning, whilst working every hour that is asked of them are being left destitute. With barely the energy to stand on two feet. Aye. The annals of history, they show us what a despot was King James II. Aye. Yet our forefathers were able to affirm their liberties without the loss of a single life. Now, why was this? This was because the people were unanimous and determined to put down tyrannism. - Aye! - Hear, hear! Hear, hear! They secured the Bill of Rights of 1689. That Bill of Rights ensured Parliament remains sovereign. But what good is a parliament if it does not represent its people? Hear, hear! What right does a king have to a payout from the government of £2 million per annum? No right! A king who has lost his senses, if he ever had any. And what right does our good, gracious, illustrious - or should I say, big fat - Prince have with one-and-a-half million? He has no right! What right do these men have with this money, when those they have robbed are starving for want? They have no right. No right at all! No, sir. They do not have that right. No! - But we have a right. - Aye! We have a right to present a petition to this big, fat prince. And that we propose to do. Hear, hear. This petition will demand at last a fair, proper and full representation - for all Englishmen. - Aye. If... If, after forty days and forty nights there is no response from our... beloved Prince... ..we shall take said petition to the King. And... if he ignores us, we have the right, as Englishmen, to imprison him and all his family. All we demand is that our voices are heard... ..and that our sufferings cease. We are on the verge of a devastating cataclysm! The time has come to alleviate the sufferings of the people. I call forth a deluge to cleanse this land of its festering corruption. Almighty Father, permit us to be the Noahs, the Deucalions and the Pyrrhas as we start this world anew. Mr Knight! Friends, I should like to invite Mr John Knight to now speak. Mr Knight. Gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Bagguley, Mr Drummond and Mr Johnston for their impassioned rhetoric. Although I cannot concur with the notion that the imprisonment of the King would advance the cause. Nevertheless, I congratulate them on their considerable fervour and their zeal. I thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr Knight. Thank you, Mr Knight. - They're going to London. - What, Bagguley and that? They're going to see the Prince. - What? - They're not! - They are, Mam. - The Prince Regent, it is. Oh, aye. They're taking him this er... What is it, Father? - Petition. - Aye, a petition. - What will it say, Father? - It's a list of demands. - Oh, aye. - Our rights. Hallelujah! Prince... thingummy isn't going to give ha'porth for a scrap of paper that's come all t'way from Lancashire. If he dun't, they'll take it to the King. And then what? He's as mad as a March hare! They said if he won't do owt, they'll lock him up. - What, the King? - Aye, the King and his family. Who's going to lock up the King? Them three lads? No, the people will. And how's the people going to do that? That's just plain daft. At least they're doing something. They're not doing owt. It's just more talk. I'll tell you what they're not doing, Nellie, they're not sitting on their backsides, waiting. I know, I know. I don't blame you for losing hope, Mam. I haven't lost hope, son. I'll never lose hope. Times is too hard to lose hope. Hope's all we've got. But you've got to start small. As they say, from little acorns... mighty oak trees grow. They must be removed forthwith. - I concur. - Hear, hear. They're polluting our streets. Indeed. We must pluck the braying bellwethers from their schismatic pulpits, but we cannot incarcerate their entire Godless flock. Three thousand fools stuffed into the New Bailey like anchovies in a pot? No, gentlemen. The rabble must be awed into submission. A mere show of military might would soon see them gambolling like little lambs back to their looms. They are ignorant souls. They know not what they want. - They are children. - Innocent babes. Babes, perhaps. Innocent? Never. The rod is all they understand. "My son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change." Gentlemen, might I urge a little forbearance? The labouring classes are ruled by their stomachs. Were we to prevail upon the mill owners to furnish them with an additional shilling per week... their hunger would be alleviated and this agitation would cease. A shilling this week, two shillings next week, a guinea for Christmas. This concerns not money. This concerns not an extension of the franchise. This concerns neither liberty nor freedom. The remedy, gentlemen, is the iron hand of the law. So we're all agreed. Grand! Gentlemen, is this not... a passing season... ..of hot-headed intemperance, which will run its course? No. It is not. Will you not join us at table, Nadin? These are dangerous men. They're a threat. We need some pretext to arrest them. Indeed. But the question is this: do we have evidence that they are inciting these people to armed insurrection? Well, we do not know that they are armed. Are they armed, Colonel? Chippendale? Gentlemen, I have witnessed no evidence of arms. You have witnessed no evidence of arms, Chippendale. But that does not mean that they do not bear arms. - In my opinion... - Your opinion? Your opinion is not important. You're an informant. Inform... or sit down. I might remind you, Deputy Chief Constable Nadin, that this man is in my employ. Colonel Fletcher, sir. Gentlemen, we cannot act without evidence. There's always evidence. You've just got to know where to look for it. And if you don't find it, you crack a few heads. When might you next visit Manchester, William? Wednesday. Early. I've to be in court. I thought I might travel with you. If you must. I should like to visit Arabella. She has the palsy. Has she, now? Listen to this. "In all my twenty years as a magistrate charged with the keeping of the peace, never have I been witness to the scale and size of these people's ambition. The trouble brewing here has a much more frightening purpose than that of winning the vote for the working man. What we are witnessing on the ground is a vast number of people ripe for insurrection. They will never give up their course until they have established a republican court." Oh, dear! "I am sorry... to have to... inform you..." "These are the most violent preachings of disaffected demagogues, who seek to strike the flint of reform against the steel of greed - the greed of a labouring class ever seeking a shilling's more wage for an hour's less toil. The resulting spark must soon take hold, threatening the very safety of our neighbourhoods. Such gatherings, and many more hewn from the same seditious block, no longer bring together a few dozen malcontents and ne'er-do-wells to pass secret codes and hidden messages at the back of Methodist Sunday school rooms, or above squalid low taverns. These meetings, now held brazenly and in plain sight, are attended in numbers in many instances exceeding three, four, five thousand. And there the rallying cry of Bagguley and his scurrilous brethren are hallooed by the ill-educated, ungodly mob as they incite them in violent and in bloody terms. They speak not of reform... but of destruction. Oh, I humbly beseech Your Lordship to do all within your power to bring forth a great deluge from above, that this may extinguish once and for all this most ferocious and bloody threat to the peace and harmony of our... great land..." No... "..of our... sweet land. I remain, as always, your most humble and obedient servant, Reverend... Charles Wicksted Ethelston." Poetry! Morning, Mr Rook. Mr Grout, sir. Lord Sidmouth and Mr Hobhouse. Thank you, Mr Cobb. Mm. Mr Golightly? The Reverend Ethelston. "The rallying cry of Bagguley and his scurrilous brethren - are hallooed by..." - Hallooed! - Hallooed! - Hallooed! "..by the ill-educated, ungodly mob as they incite them in violent and in bloody terms." Heaven defend his congregation, Mr Grout. Indeed, Mr Golightly. Ethelston. "Bring forth a deluge from above..." The bard of Manchester. Five thousand at Bagguley's meeting! Bagguley? I believe the time has come to remove the head of this particular serpent. - How old is he? - Nineteen. - Sunday school scholars. - Indeed. We have given this young man enough rope with which to hang himself. I suggest we tighten the knot. This plague ever spreads throughout the land. We must be brutal, with a cautious hand. Indeed we must. Another magisterial missive from Manchester. Hmm. Gentlemen, may I first avow, that it is a matter of some pride... ..immense privilege and not insignificant encouragement... to be met here today in this great metropolis of London with such a wide and devoted body of reformers. Hear, hear. I am certain that we have all, at times, faced with the mighty forces of tyranny wielded by those in power... ..felt that our actions were of no more impact than the ripples thrown up by a single pebble tossed into the sea. Hear, hear. But let us know, as we turn to each other in this room, as we look our fellow man in the eye, in the sure knowledge that we gather here to protect and improve the lives and future lives of the tens, the hundreds of thousands of souls that we have the great honour to represent... ..let us know that those ripples can and will begin to grow. - Aye! - Hear, hear! They will grow as we grow together. Aye. And as we combine, in courage, conviction and companionship... Hear, hear. ..those ripples will become torrents, - will become waves... - Hear, hear! ..that will rise inexorably, until they begin to pound this land and come crashing down on the corrupt old order. Aye! Well said, sir! Hear, hear! So that from the rich fertile ground, left behind by these magnificent, mighty waves, will rise up the purest shoots of regrowth and renewal. - Aye! Huzzah! - Hear, hear! Hear, hear! So that from our actions, actions forged by the needs, the cries, the ardent pleas of our common man, we may put that common man at the heart of any Commons House of Parliament. - Well said, sir! - Hear, hear! One vote for each and all free men! Let that vote be cast in secret, and annually. That is what we must seek. For let it never be in doubt... .. that there can finally be no cessation of any reform that is undeniably right, just, and in the overwhelming interest of the multitude! Mr Hunt, sir. Pray pardon the intrusion, sir, but may I say how heart-warming it is to hear a man speak from the heart on a subject so close to our hearts. Aye. I thank you for your kind words. We are fellow reformers, sir, from Lancashire way. Indeed? Samuel Bamford and Mr Joseph Healey. Dr Healey. Gentlemen. Would tha' care to join us in a pot of ale, Mr Hunt? T'would be a great honour for t'both of us. Alas, I must soon return to my rooms but I thank you, gentlemen. - Good day, sir. - Good day, sir. Might I trouble you to stand, sir? Thank you, sir. Have you misplaced something, missus? Mouse droppings. You are Mr... - Richards. - Mr Richards. And what can we do for you, Mr Richards? It's more of a case of what I can do for you, gentlemen. And what can you do for us, Mr Richards? May I? If you must, but make haste. Thank you. I'm a patriot, just like you, gentlemen. I would lay down my life for my country. I have certain information that I believe would be very useful to you. I have contacts... skills, ways and means. Where do you hail from, Mr Richards? Here and there. London. It's... hard to say. Have you visited the North of England? Yes and no. But I'm familiar enough with the North, sir. These contacts. Are they in the North? Maybe. Debating clubs? Union societies? Reform meetings? Perhaps. Where? When? Soon. You receive visitors in London? - From time to time. - How many? Too many to count. Come, come, Mr Richards. We should need numbers and names. But of course. At a price. "My Lords and Gentlemen... ..it is with deep regret that I am again obliged to announce to you that no alteration has occurred in the state of my dear father, His Majesty the King's, lamented indisposition. The distresses consequent upon the termination of a war of such unusual extent and duration have been felt, with greater or less severity, throughout all the nations of Europe. You will, I doubt not, feel a just indignation at the attempts which have been made to take advantage of the distresses of the country, for the purpose of exciting a spirit of sedition and violence." "I am too well convinced of the loyalty and good sense of the great body of His Majesty's subjects, to believe them capable of being perverted by the arts which are employed to seduce them. But I am determined to omit no precautions for preserving the public peace, and for counteracting the designs of the disaffected. And I rely with the utmost confidence on your cordial support and cooperation, in upholding a system of law and government, which I deem to be the most perfect that has ever fallen to the lot of any people." Hear, hear! - Give us a potato. - What? - Gi' us a tattie. - What for? God save the Prince Regent! What're you doin'? That's our supper! Ah! Ahh! Billy! Lord Chancellor! My Lords! I have one of the most important communications to make to your Lordships, that has ever been made to Parliament. His Royal Highness was only now leaving this House when he was most viciously attacked with a stone, or as some say, two balls, fired from an air-gun... or some other heinous instrument. The malignant spirit, born of the odious French Revolution, is even now plainly persuading our people that, alone by open violence, can their grievances be redressed. I am deeply pained upon this occasion, to state that I require the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. And, my Lords, I ask that this power should be communicated without d-delay... Hear, hear! ..for here procrastination would spell nothing short of... ruin. Hear, hear. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Joseph. I bring us good fortune. - We can do with some of that. - Aye. I found this on Deansgate. How are you faring? What tidings? - How's the brush trade, Joe? - Grand. Grand. It thrives, John, it thrives. So, gentlemen, our response to this evil action. - We must be clear. - Indeed. We have a duty to our readers to explain what a barbaric act this is. It may be that not every reader will understand what Habeas Corpus means. - Indeed. - Exactly so. We must remind them. "Habeas Corpus means every Briton's right to protection against unlawful arrest and detainment without charge." - Er... Good. - It is a... a cornerstone - of our constitution. - Aye. Without which the common man is reduced to slavery. Yes. Now, "There are three classes of men - lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour and lovers of gain." Plato. We're aware it's Plato, John, but is it truly to the matter? In my opinion, it is. I think not in this instant. - Jack not in this morning? - Fetching paper supplies. - Grand, grand. - Read that out, James. "It is the cornerstone of our constitution without which we are reduced to..." Now then, lads. - Good morrow, gentlemen. - Sam. Doctor. How are you going at this end of t'country? How are you going at t'other end more to the point? - We've been to London. - When did you get back up? - Last night. - By coach. - We were inside. - Aye, keeping out of t'rain. Please, gentlemen, make yourselves comfortable. Aye. Smoky and dark as ever, were London. Shan't be going back there in a hurry. - There were uproar. - An attack on t'Prince! - Did you hear about it? - So we heard, aye. There were talk of gunfire. - Pistol shot, rifle shot... - Cannon fire. We heard he was hit by a potato. Poor fat lad, wouldn't know what to do wi' a raw potato. But, think on this. We saw Mr Henry Hunt addressing t'crowd. You saw Orator Hunt? Orator Hunt. Isn't that right, Doctor? Aye, we saw him, we heard him and we were moved by him. - That right, Sam? - Aye, at Elephant And Castle. Never afore did I see a man so gifted in public speak - and I've heard a few in my time. Tha'self included, John. You're not so bad on the hustings, Sam. Aye, I have a certain following. But not like this man. It's as if he were born to it. - We can all deliver a speech. - Do not get me wrong, John. I'm not saying that tha'self cannot turn a phrase, but this feller, he knows how to unite the crowd. - Do we not all do that? - Aye, but... he speaks with a... a passion and a fervour about t'same matters and t'same concerns we've all been preaching about these past years, but when he does it, the crowd, they follow him. They're in t'palm of his hand. They say he's not a modest man. Aye, "vainglorious", I've heard folk describe him. Well, I daresay he's not perfect. - Who of us here is? - Was he wearing his white hat? - Aye. - Aye. He were wearing his white hat. So you could see him, aye. You wouldn't miss him in t'crowd. - Jack. - Good day, gentlemen. - Jack. How do? - Jack. Here he is. - Is he not a landowner? - Aye, he is, James, and a countryman - and a wealthy one at that. And that gives him the wherewithal and the ability to fight for liberty and reform. - True, true. - Now think on this. If you lads, through your newspaper, and t'Manchester Patriotic Union, are planning this big public meeting at Peter's Field to discuss universal suffrage and the election of a representative for Manchester in Parliament, then surely you would want Henry Hunt addressing t'crowd alongside t'rest of us. We don't need some fancy dandy coming up here, taking over the show. Hey, John Saxton, I come here to speak as I find. Thy prejudice is thine own affair. But will he be as effectual up here with our people, as he is down there with London folk? - Aye. - He would be effectual anywhere in t'country as long as there were a crowd to listen to him. From John O'Groats to t'Land's End. Did you speak to him? We made ourselves known to him, aye. - We told him our business. - And what was he like? In himself. Why... you'd be... hard pushed to say. - He were... - Aye. - He has a round face. - Aye. You might say he were a bit bland. Aye, but I do hear tell he has his own brewery. Aye. True, true. Now, if I am done here, my good wife has promised me a hot potato pie on my return to Middleton, so if tha' will allow me, John, I shall be making my way up t'bank to avail myself of it. We shall give this matter our due consideration. - Aye. Well, think on. - Good day, gentlemen. - Good day. - See thee later, lads. Good day. - Where are we up to, Jack? - Just off three hundred. Can you not go any faster? A faster printer you'll not find in the whole of Manchester. Thank you, sir. Right, gentlemen, I must away. - Good day. - Good day. Good day. Here's tha' beer, Joseph. - Who's tha' writing to? - Hush, woman. I am writing to the great orator, Mr Henry Hunt... ..Esquire. Oh. Here is the intercepted mail, Mr Grout. Thank you, Mr Cobb. Hmm. Exactly so. Most definitely, Mr Grout. Yes, I concur, Mr Golightly. Who is this Johnson? He holds a position of influence amongst the middle class radicals of Manchester. He is a brush manufacturer. A brush manufacturer? Apparently. There is now little doubt that this mass meeting will take place. - Legally, we cannot ban it. - Alas, not. A working class upstart orator is one thing, but a land-owning, self-styled man of the people like Hunt is quite another. We cannot allow this Wiltshire peacock to incite the disaffected masses under the spurious guise of parliamentary reform. This is a powder keg which will ignite at the slightest spark. I believe it prudent that we write to General Byng immediately. Indeed. Instruct him to increase his forces to the utmost degree possible. - Post haste, my Lord. - And, Hobhouse, insist that the local magistrates exercise the greatest restraint. Very good, my Lord. Dear sisters, welcome to the Manchester Female Reform Society. They said we've got to pay, but I'm not paying 'cos I 'aven't got owt to give. There is no money to be given if you do not have it. Please, do take a seat. I'm right standing, thank you. As you wish. As I'm sure you are all aware, there is to be a great meeting at St Peter's Field to further the cause of reform. We have reviewed for a considerable time past the apathy and frequent insult of our oppressed countrymen by the borough-mongering aristocracy. And in order to accelerate the emancipation of our suffering nation, we do declare that we will assist the male union formed in this town, with all the might and energy that we possess, in obtaining the object of our common solicitude. I don't understand a word you're saying. - Give over and sit down. - No, she's right. I don't understand what she's saying neither. - No. - Ladies, please, you will all get a chance to speak. Pray silence for our president, Mrs Fildes. Thank you, Susanna. One man, one vote. Representation for all of us, for each and every family. Hear, hear! We are neither ashamed, nor afraid, of thus aiding our menfolk, and we are actuated by no motives of petty vanity. We come together as wives, mothers, daughters and sisters in our social, domestic and moral capacities. Aye. May our flag never be unfurled but in the sacred cause of liberty, peace and reform, and then may a female's curse pursue the coward who deserts the standard. Aye! And now, ladies, our secretary, Mrs Susanna Saxton, will say a few words. Sisters of the earth, how could you bear to see the infant at the breast drawing from you the remnants of your last blood, instead of the nourishment which nature requires? The only subsistence for yourselves being a draught of cold water. We can no longer bear to see numbers of our parents immured in workhouses, our fathers separated from our mothers in direct contradiction to the laws of God and man, our sons degraded below human nature, our husbands and our little ones clothed in rags and pining on the face of the earth. Our enemies are resolved upon destroying the last vestige of the natural rights of man, and we are determined to establish it. For as well might they attempt to arrest the sun in the region of space, or stop the diurnal motion of the earth, as to impede the rapid progress of our enlightened friends to liberty and truth. You're talking bullscutter, an' all. - Be quiet! - You be quiet! No, you sit down now and stop your brabblement. Order! Ladies, please! We cannot bear the ponderous weight of our chains any longer. But we must tear them asunder and dash them in the face of our remorseless oppressors, who have nearly picked bare the bones of those who labour. - They have, they have! - Aye, they have! The founder of Christianity, Jesus Christ, He was the greatest reformer of all. Sisters, the bitter cup of oppression is now full to the brim. Well done, Susanna. It's true! It's true is that. We come out on strike last year. We were out seven weeks, wasn't we? Aye, we wa'! They beat us back to work and we've got nowt to show for it, nowt! I've got two lads to feed and nowt to give 'em. - Be quiet, the both of you! - No, you be quiet! - You be quiet! - Don't you belder at me. Ladies! Let us move on to the next subject on the agenda. So... let me get this straight, now. There's going to be a big march. - Aye! - At Peter's Field. - Outside? - Aye. - Not indoors? - No. - In broad daylight? - Yes! - On a Monday. - A Monday? - I know, it's daft. - Second Monday in August. - Not go to work? - Aye. They'll have to make do without us. We'll get the sack! Not if all the mills turn out. You're playing with fire. No, Mother, this one'll be different. Different? How? There's hundreds going, women and children an' all. We've to turn out in our Sunday best. Ah, well, I best get me darning needles out, then. Aye, you should, same as t'rest of t'street will be. I know they will, but so will that Nadin and his bullies, the swine. They'll have to get past them! Aye, but people have been practising marching peacefully. Haven't they, Father? Oh, aye, up on Kersal Moor, they say. - Childer? - Aye, 'ole families. It's a day out for everybody. We've to stand up for ourselves, Esther. We can't go on being afraid. I know, love, but we've all got to be careful, though. John! John Bagguley? Aye? It's an honour to meet you, sir. Your reputation precedes you. They say you're a great orator. Do they? Your message is strong and clear... and true. You're not from around these parts, are you? I'm a radical, John - just like yourself. - Greetings, friend. - Greetings. May I ask you a question, John? Are you as angry as I am? I am angry. But are you angry enough? People need to see how angry we are, John. Rise up. Fight! Violence... hatred... ..destruction. We are prepared. We have arms ready. Then use 'em. When the time is right... ..we will. The time is now, John. Until next time. Call me Oliver. Friends... thank you for being here today. But let me state this meeting will be short, as the suspension of Habeas Corpus is upon us. This is not the end. No, this is only the beginning. Aye. But permit me to say... that when the power... of any government... is in the hands of an agreed number of persons, whose interest together with the interest of the government are different and distinct to that of the people... ..well, so then such is the case, the speedy destruction of our nation is inevitable. Hear, hear! Hear, hear. Thank you for your time. Thank you. My friend, Samuel Drummond, will now speak. Thank you, Mr John Bagguley. Friends, I will only speak very briefly today. The time for speaking is over. Now... Now is the time for action. Our chief intention is to restore to you your long lost liberty by you arming yourselves, and being strong and resolute and ready to win back your ancient rights for yourselves. - Aye. - Hear, hear! Now is the time for action! Now. Not tomorrow, not next week. - Now! - Hear, hear! For my part, I will stick to you until my last drop of blood is expended. If the whole host of hell come against me, I will not stir an inch, because I know our cause is true and just, and the Lord Himself shines His heavenly light upon us. Hear, hear! Get all armed! Give me my liberty, or let me die. Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! I thank you. My friend, John Johnston, will now say a few words. Fellow countrymen... ..the time has come to rise from your lethargy. - Aye. - Yes. No longer will our blood, sweat and toil line the pockets of the avaricious aristocracy and the landowners. No longer will the curdled screams of starving children echo through the streets of Manchester and beyond. Our French brethren have shown us the way. We must punish our mad king and his gluttonous offspring by taking off their heads! - Oh, yes! - Yes! I declare to that God that gave me being, that superintends my actions, that one day, I must give an answer for all that I do on this earth, that whenever... whenever it lies within my power, - I will strike them down! - Aye! And, if I cannot effect it, I hope the women of this great nation will tear them limb from bleeding limb like the Maenads on Mount Cithaeron! - Yes! - Arm yourselves! Bring pistols, guns, swords and pikes, and if you cannot attain these weapons, bring yourself a pair of tongs and a poker, hot from the fire! Be ready, lads, and true to yourselves! Give me liberty, or give me death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! Let's go. You bastard! Let go of me, you bastard! - I shall never be defeated! - You will not silence us! - We will never relent. - Hey, you bastard! We will never give up the fight for liberty! Liberty or death! Liberty or death! You cannot confine us to these receptacles of the damned! Get in. Get in! I'm going to smash your teeth down your throat! Get in! Get in! No! No! Get off me, you bastard! Get off! Oww! Get off me! Jesus Christ Himself was the greatest ever reformer! You will not silence our cause. Help! Left, right. Left, right. Stand still! About face, gentlemen! Dressings! Quick march! Listen to the drum. Swing your arms. By the right. Move to the right! Right face! Pick up your dressings! Right, then left. Keep dressing from the right! Swing those arms! Pick up your dressings, gentlemen! Let's have a bit of pride! Mr Hunt? Joseph Johnson of the Manchester Observer. Ah, Mr Johnson. Er... This is Mr Knight, Mr Saxton and Mrs Saxton, the Secretary of the Manchester Female Reform Society. - Good evening, Mr Hunt. - Madam. - Welcome. - How kind. - Good day sir. - Mr Hunt. Gentlemen. At last. We should like to thank you for enduring your long journey. Welcome to Manchester. I shall indeed look forward to a good night's repose in anticipation of tomorrow's exertions. Mr Hunt, I regret to inform you that the meeting will no longer take place tomorrow. It has been postponed, Mr Hunt, until tomorrow week, the 16th. For what reason, pray? Due to circumstances beyond our control. What circumstances? Our intention was that the meeting should consider the propriety of electing a so-called Parliamentary representative for this district. Mr Johnson, did I not stipulate that my attendance here in Manchester was conditional upon there being no mention of any such illegal election? We were not planning to hold an election, sir, merely to discuss the possibility of an election. Aye. The magistrates misunderstood our intentions. Because it was a foolish proposition in the first place. Mr Hunt, as you very well know, Manchester has no Parliamentary representation. - We do not. It's a scandal. - Time is pressing. You, of all people, know that. Yes, Mr Saxton, I am well aware that time is pressing. That is why I cannot spend one week of my life in Manchester. But thousands of people are eager to hear you speak. Then I shall leave it to you to explain my absence. Sir, there will be a great outcry if you do not appear. - It will be carnage. - Only your presence can promote tranquillity and good order. Sir, please let us conduct you to your hotel. That is out of the question. With my name, any longer than one night in any hotel in this land, and the place will be swarming with spies. Then we must find more secluded accommodation. This is where I reside, Mr Hunt. Leave it there. Mr Hunt? Good evening, madam. This is my dear wife, Mrs Johnson. Mr Henry Hunt. Mr Johnson, if I could perhaps be shown to my rooms? Indeed. Sarah, show Mr Hunt upstairs. Oh. Erm... This way, Mr Hunt. If you would provide me with some writing materials? - Very well. - And my trunk. Mrs Johnson, if you could bring me a light repast? What's that? - I thank you, Sir John. - A pleasure. Always good to see you, Guy. Now, to be clear, I myself may not be present at this little gathering. Indeed, I understand that. I have other matters to attend to, but I have every confidence in you, old boy. I shall endeavour to do my best, sir. Stout fellow. Your horse. Aye, aye. Ah, good morning, Joseph. Go on. No. - Are they not ready yet? - No. Not while this afternoon, you said. - Right. - Give us a look. That one in't done yet. It's grand. Good. We are in a state of painful uncertainty, Sir John. - We are. - No doubt. And we feel comforted and assured by your presence, your prowess in dealing with civil disorder, and in the knowledge that we are in your safe hands. - Hear, hear. - Indeed. Thank you, gentlemen. However, at this stage, I would urge you to show caution, and to abstain from any precipitous acts. General, with the greatest of respect, the time for caution is over. Sir, I am of the opinion that the presence alone of the civil and military force that we have in readiness is sufficient to deter any conceivable sedition. You're speaking of insurrection. Indeed. Moreover we cannot allow these radicals to follow the example of their French brethren on the 16th of August. Mr Norris, the General's very attendance upon the day will ensure that no such catastrophe can possibly occur. Gentlemen, regarding my attendance upon the day. My attention may be called to other quarters, and I do not find myself in a position wherein I can guarantee my presence. Am I to understand that you will have more pressing business elsewhere? There is a distinct possibility. But, I have the utmost confidence in my second in command, Colonel L'Estrange. He is a fine soldier. I see. L'Estrange. Indeed, sir. Mr Tuke, is this to take up much more of my time? No, Mr Hunt. The stiller you sit, the sooner we'll be done. Arm down, please. Am I permitted to use my right arm? You may use your right arm as long as it does not impede on our progress with your left arm. May I enquire as to the nature of your speech, Mr Hunt? It concerns the inalienable civil liberties - of all free men. - Does it, now? My wife expresses something of an interest in attending your gathering on Monday. Will you not be attending with her? No. I'm not one for too much talk. Mr Hunt, please. Miss? Would you be so kind as to hold down my papers? Hold down t'papers? Top left corner. Me 'ands are dirty. That's no matter. These are... ...notes for myself alone. Will I be in t'picture? Nay, lass, thou'll't not be in t'picture. Bessie! Leave t'gentleman alone! The young lady is providing me with assistance, Mrs Johnson. Oh, I beg pardon, Mr Hunt. Understand this, I care not. I will not be paraded like some beast in a menagerie. Can I not get thee a drink, Sam? No, thank you, my dear. Who is that? It's Mr Hunt. Oh, yes. Sam. May I ask what thee would like to speak to Mr Hunt regarding? What I would like to speak to Mr Hunt regarding, Joe... I would like to speak to Mr Hunt regarding. Aye. Well, it would appear Mr Hunt is otherwise occupied at present. Oh. Well, we all have matters that need attending to, Joe. And I'm sure Mr Hunt can spare a few moments to speak to a fellow reformer. - Mr Bamford. - Mr Hunt. What is it of such import that it cannot wait till Monday? How are you going on at our end o' t'country, sir? Sadly, I have been immured within these four walls this past week. Though I am grateful to the kind hospitality - of these good people. - Aye, I'm glad to hear it. They are indeed good people. Now, speaking o' t'meeting a-Monday, we've been drilling t'lads in ranks for nigh on a month now, and we have a thousand men moving together as if it were a mere score, sir. I am heartened to hear it, Mr Bamford. I am told that we are to anticipate a mighty crowd. Aye. Aye, we are that, sir. And we shall do thee proud. Now, we have been instilling into t'lads the principles of cleanliness, sobriety, order, and also t'notion of peace, which I believe were your own personal addage to t'list, sir, and one which I respect greatly. Now, these ideas have been taken to heart by all t'lads and have been carried well throughout all t'ranks, sir. I look forward to seeing it with mine own eyes, Mr Bamford. I'm sure they'll do you proud. Now, on that subject, sir... ..would it not be prudent of us to have a small contingent of men - say a score or two amongst a thousand - armed with cudgels just to protect... Mr Johnson, will you show Mr Bamford the door? Mr Hunt, I have come here to speak man to man about an important matter. Then let me speak to you man to man, Mr Bamford. If any man is armed with so much as a stone on Monday, there will be no meeting at which I will speak. There are a large body of men signed up at Manchester. And women and children. And it is them that I seek to protect. I am speaking of t'Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, sir. A large body of men are signed up, and weapons have been widely distributed amongst them. And it is precisely for that reason that we must give them no provocation. But these are men who are not only politically averse to our cause, sir, but also personally averse to us. - Mr Bamford... - Are we to lead our young'uns and our wives and our sweethearts into the mouth of such a threat, wi'out t'means of defending them? Mr Bamford, I understand your fears. But you have not been to a mass meeting as this promises to be. I have. I have spoken at meetings in London of over one hundred thousand people, and at those meetings not one blade of grass, not a gust of wind, has been the recipient of a single act of violence. Had they been, the authorities would have taken it as permission to break up not only the meeting, but the entire movement. I will not have my reputation and name, and the virtues which I espouse, besmirched for the behaviour of a single group of men... But this is Lancashire, sir, and the authorities here have no regard for thy reputation or anybody else's. And meetings of this nature, hereabouts, invariably end in violence. That is because they have not been addressed by me. Dost thy have children of thine own, sir? I do, sir. And would thee lead thy children into danger such as this? I would gladly lead my children by the hand, with a song in my heart, to any meeting chaired by Henry Hunt. Uh-huh. Well, I am hardly satisfied by that. But as this is a committee decision not to bear arms, then I suppose I am duty bound to carry it. But I shall pray to God that He might afford some protection to our vulnerable folk. I shall see thee a-Monday, sir, and let us hope it is a day... we need not look back on with regret. Let us hope that, both. Aye. Good day. Joseph. Mrs Johnson. I do apologise, Mr Hunt. I want him watched from now until Monday. There will be no violence. I shall see to it. There are to be no weapons. Rest assured. Let us continue our supper. Oh, it will have gone cold, Mr Hunt. It's no matter, Mrs Johnson. Gentlemen, I hope you may permit me to dispense with the formalities. We neither need nor desire introductions, Mr Hunt. Indeed not. Well, then, let me ask plainly. Is there, as I've been led to believe that there is, a charge against my name? I suggest you may be a victim of false information, Mr Hunt. There is presently no such charge. There is no such charge at present? - No, sir. - Would that there were, Mr Hunt. Well, sir, should there be, let me avow that I would freely and without hesitation, offer myself up for arrest. I seek no subterfuge here in Manchester. Good evening, gentlemen. You remain at liberty, Mr Hunt, but I might remind you that we retain the full and unwavering support of His Majesty's Government and military force. As I, sir, retain the support of the people. You, sir, are a blaggard! Buffoon. He should be clapped in irons. It takes but a matter of moments to inscribe a man's name on a warrant. - Good evening. - Good evening, madam, sir. I am seeking Mr Henry Hunt. I was told he would be at this address at this hour. And you are? Richard Carlile of Sherwin's Political Register, London. Mr Carlile! Joseph Johnson of the Manchester Observer. Mr Johnson. - Oh, do come in. - Thank you. - Ah, Henry! - Richard. What do you here in Manchester? Why, I... I am here to attend tomorrow's great assembly, naturally. But at whose invitation? Why, that of Mr Wroe and... and Mr Knight of the Manchester Observer. And why was I not informed of this? Well, I... I have prepared some words to address the multitude. Richard, I'm afraid we have agreed that the number of speakers tomorrow will be kept to a minimum. Henry, I have brought with me one hundred impressions of your exemplary Smithfield speech on civil and universal liberty, to distribute tomorrow. This was last month. I do not intend to repeat myself. The people of these parts must know that reform is not merely a matter of achieving universal suffrage, but... but of freedom from the tyranny of the Church and of the destruction of monarchy. Richard, in Manchester, universal suffrage is the sole message. That alone. I thank you for your pains. Henry, what consideration have you given to the possibility of violence tomorrow? I fear it greatly. Richard, firstly you advise me how to speak. Now you advise me how to behave. I feel your interventions are both excessive and unnecessary. Well, perhaps you will allow me to travel with you tomorrow? Mr Johnson, might there be room in the barouche? Aye, I should think so, Mr Hunt. Well, then, yes, you must. You'll be my guest. I thank you. Our chains are shaking, Henry. They will be broken. I will take my leave. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. I must apologise for the continued interruptions, - Mrs Johnson. - Oh. I can assure you, come Tuesday, your lives will return to normalcy. Go home, Bessie. Yes, Mrs Johnson. Good night, Mr Johnson. - Y'a'right? - Aye. - The heat's knocked her out. - Ooh... It's too warm. Aye. - I'll not sleep tonight. - It might cool down later on. Aye. - Night. - Good night, love. Night, Father. You a'right for tomorrow? Aye, I reckon so. It'll be a good day, Mother. Aye, it will. Night. Night, love. You a'right? Aye. Look at her. - Little angel. - Mmm. I were just thinking, in 1900, she'll be eighty five. - Will she? - Aye, of course she will. She'll be a great-grandma. - Wishing her life away! - Oh, I'm just saying. I hope it's a better world for her. Summat'll get better. Some things'll never change. They say there'll be a lot of folk there tomorrow, waving their flags, banging their drums. I hope so. Good night, Mother. Night, Father. Right, we've got five lads in t'front row... Absolutely right. Right, women in rows of five! Come on, you girls! Rows of five. Sort yourselves out. - Now, then... - Right. Who's got t'banner here? That end. That's it, lads. You lads at t'end there. Hey, now. Keep in rank and file right, lads. Keep to the right. - Mary. - Right, let's have a look. Now, then. The meeting we are going to today... is t'biggest and t'most important meeting about parliamentary reform we've ever had. So, lads, stay in your ranks! The more calmness and sensibility we show now, the more we make liars of our enemies, who have represented us as a mob and a rabble these past few years. And let's shame them with our good conduct. Now, what we are going to town for today, we're not going to beg or plead... ..because what we want, it's not theirs to give! It were given to us by God, on t'day of our birth, as honest Englishmen. And with that in mind, no weapons must be allowed on t'march as agreed by t'committee. So come on, lads, drop the sticks, drop your clubs. Drop your knives and your cudgels. There's no need for violence here. That's it, boys. Now, then. First stop, will be Sam Ogden's taphouse in Harpurhey... And then on to Manchester... ..and liberty! Left foot forward, lads! Left! Left! Left! Left! Come on - get on with it. Get a move on. There's stones all over here. Get 'em on the back of this cart, and quick! Scum. - That's what they are. Scum. - Aye, they are that, sir. I put food on their table and this is how they repay me. They've got no right, sir. - Are we all ready? - Aye, Nellie. Aye. Reet, come on! Aye. - Morning, Eli! - Morning, Nellie. - Looking forward to it? - Yes. - All right, lad? - Aye. Morning. - Liberty or death. - Annual parliaments! No taxation without representation! Vote by ballot! - No Corn Laws! - Universal suffrage! - Get back to your husbands! - Shame! Whores! Harlots! Hussies! Go home to your babies! - It'll achieve nowt. - Friends, unite and be free! Gentlemen, for King and Country! - Aye, sir. King and Country. - King and Country! To King and Country! To King and Country! - And again! - To King and Country! And again! To King and Country! ..give them a bit of justice! Liberty! Liberty! Liberty! You wait till you get to the field. Mr Norris, how do you do? - Look at them. - It is without precedent. Is the room in readiness? - Aye, it is. - Very good. I sent my man here earlier with some wine. Is it... - Aye, sir, it's over there. - Excellent. - Could I have a word? - Of course. I don't know what's going to happen this afternoon. Mr Buxton, would you kindly remove that... sheet? Certainly, sir. Gentlemen, should you need refreshment, we have some fine claret here, if you wish to avail yourselves. Gentlemen, I wish you well with your business today. If nature calls, there's a pot in t'corner. - Good day, sir. - Thank you, very much. What's going on now? I don't know. We're just waiting. How long have you been waiting for? Ah, not long. - Have you come far? - Chadderton. - That's Oldham way, in't it? - Aye. - That's a fair way. - Aye, it is. Too far. Father, what are you doing now? Where you going? - Has he had enough? - He's got to walk back yet. - How far is it? - Nine mile. - See thee. - Aye, see thee. Colonel Fletcher, just where are the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry? They stand hard by in Portland Street. They await my orders. We should summon them immediately. Once the crowd see them, they shall disperse. In my view, that would be the wrong course of action. We should arrest Hunt before he arrives. Send in the troops and spirit him away somewhere. These people are in a good mood. The men have brought their wives and their children with them. In the presence of women, men behave better. Men, women, wives, children, I care not! We are their moral superiors. It is our Christian duty to bring the axe down on this riotous mob! Well said, sir! Well said! They are not mere animals, Mallory. They are honest, gullible folk. I agree with Mr Warmley. Arrest Hunt before he arrives in the field. You silence the man today and he'll be rousing another rabble - before the fortnight's out! - Absolutely! We must give him just sufficient rope for him to hang himself. We are in charge, gentlemen, and we must be seen to be in charge, and not Hunt. - Hear, hear! - I am not disputing that, sir. If I might advise you, from a legal standpoint, it is essential that the true character of that assembly be allowed to reveal itself. "One man, one vote"! "Parliamentary Representation"! Outrageous. - Preposterous propositions! - Sedition! We must allow Hunt to speak, so that he be seen to be inciting a gullible mass of people to riot. Then we may act with promptitude and vigour. We must read the Riot Act and we must do so immediately. I second that! Prepare ourselves legally to clear the field. I have the Riot Act here, and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd! We find you in glad spirits. We shall maintain our spirits. Primarily our function is to observe. Secondly, we must expedite the express directives of the Home Office, which are namely to allow the meeting to take place... It is an illegal meeting! - But, is it? - It is not illegal, gentlemen. We must let Hunt speak and then only seek to intervene should the crowd then move to riot. So is there a level of bloodletting which you find acceptable, Mr Norris? Gentlemen, may I remind you that today is not the Sabbath. It is a Monday, and Monday is a working day and these idlers and sluggards should be at their toil. Aye, and what are they up to instead? The gates of hell are open night and day. Smooth the descent and easy is the way. Have you any idea how the introduction of the mechanical loom has changed the life of this town? - I have, sir. - Then why not stay silent? Then why not join the mob, sir? - The mechanical loom... - All this is prevarication! Mr Hunt! Mr Hunt! John Tyas, the London Times. - Tyas? - Mr Tyas? I wonder if you might admit me onto the hustings. For what purpose? To spread more of your falsehoods? Not at all, sir. - Keep close. - Much obliged, Mr Hunt. Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen, you have many strong... opinions. But if I may, speaking as the chairman for this special committee of magistrates... Beg pardon, Mr Hulton. - Did you say the chairman? - Indeed I did, sir. - But you're not the chairman. - I am the chairman. I am the chairman. You are mistaken, sir. I am to take the chair. Upon whose authority? Upon the authority, sir, of the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. - Give way, sir! - Mr Norris, sir, stand down! - Stand down! - It is settled. May we proceed? I suppose you may, Mr Hulton. Move back! Move back! Move back! Back! Back! Move them back! Oh. Get back! Universal suffrage! Votes by ballot! The white hat, there. Look. - That's him, sir. - And the women. - Votes by ballot! - Can you see? Give them a wave! Give them a wave! Unite and be free! Hunt and liberty! How do? How do? Gentlemen. Gentlemen, what are your intentions regarding that mob? To whom am I speaking? Oh, you know very well to whom you are speaking, sir. - I do not. - We, sir, are in fear for our persons and our property! - Aye. - Not to mention our lives! I can sympathise with your fears, and I may share your concerns, but I will not tolerate your behaviour! Our men are in readiness and they will be dispatched in due course. You have your Manchester and Salford Yeomanry - at your disposal. - And His Majesty's forces! - Use them! - We are the law, sir. And we will use them when we see fit! Pah! Hunt forever! - She's unwell. - She's fainted. Bring her into the carriage. Thank you. Thank you, Mr Knight. Oh, what a splendid multitude, Henry. Universal liberty! I have never before seen such a great multitude. Aye. This is the day, John. - Go on, Mary. Go on! - Yes, take your hat off. - Go on. - And your frock. - Universal liberty! - As I promised, Mr Hunt, the largest assemblage ever seen in Manchester! Alas, with the wind as it is, it might have been better had the hustings been positioned in the far corner. I was given assurance that this was the best position, Mr Hunt. It is no matter. I've succeeded with worse. How are you finding Manchester? Oh, I'm very fond of it, thank you, Mrs Saxton. The first of many trips north in the interests of reform. Sir? Edward Baines, Leeds Mercury. Ah, Mr Baines. Please join us. You are welcome. Thank you, sir. - Which paper? - The Leeds Mercury. Ghastly rag. John Tyas of the London Times. - All the way from London? - Hmm. And you are, madam? Susanna Saxton of the Manchester Female Reform Society. I do hope you will represent us favourably, Mr Tyas. - Mr Knight. - Is that Mr Smith? - Who's that? - Ah, Mr Saxton. - Welcome, Smith. - Mr Wroe. I was informed you were not able to attend. Oh, I shouldn't have missed this for the world, sir. Look at the people! - Ah, Mr Healey. - Doctor. Ah, Mr Baines. John Tyas of the London Times. Edward Baines, Leeds Mercury. Make sure we have a moment for the address. - Aye, aye. - John Smith, Editor of the Liverpool Mercury and Political Herald. Good to have you here, sir. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. - You have my voice. - Thank you, sir. We should have stuck together. Aye. Shall we try and find them? No, it's useless. - See 'em back at t'house. - Aye. - Where are they? - I don't know. - Can you see 'em, Joseph? - No. - They should be close. - Aye. - All these folk. - I know. Well, we're all right. We've got bread. Here's Sam. Make way for the Middleton lot! Make way for Sam Bamford! Make way for Sam. Here's Sam Bamford. Make way for Sam. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We're here! Now, lads. Stay in your ranks and all folks stay close to t'colours. Go on, Sam! - Hello, Mr Bamford! - Mr Bamford! - Hello, Mr Bamford. - Now, then, Sam. - We have arrived! - Behold! I can barely believe it, John. - Doctor! What a day, eh? - Sam! - What a day. - Mr Johnson. I do not want Mr Bamford on the hustings. Hey, John. How do? This is only the beginning, Sam. Aye, true. Mr Hunt. Joseph. Is tha' impressed wi' t'turnout, Joe? Aye, I am indeed, Sam. Now, shall I speak afore Mr Hunt or after him? We agreed there is to be only one speaker on this occasion. Only one speaker was advertised, Mr Bamford. That was myself. Well, 'ere is your audience, Orator Hunt. And pray remember they deserve much more than fine words and empty promises. I shall make my way to yon public house where I shall rest my feet, for it has been a long, long journey to this place. And what you have to say, sir, I have heard many a time afore. Many a time. Hey, Mr Bamford, do not leave us! Aye, lads, well done for turning out, lads. - It is a great shame, Samuel. - Sam. - Sam! Samuel! - Mr Bamford? - He's getting down. - He's got a right cob on. Wait, please. Mr Johnson, might we commence? Aye. If you are ready, Mr Hunt. Good man. Have courage. Breathe from the bottom of your lungs and speak at the top of your voice. Fellow citizens... It er... It is with great honour that I should like to propose Mr Henry Hunt Esquire as our chairman. Let's see what he has to say, eh? Let's see what he has to say! Go on, Henry! Gentlemen... Friends, all. The Riot Act, Mr Ethelston. I shall bear you witness. "Our Sovereign Lord, the King... ..chargeth and commandeth all person..." It would be hardly worthwhile... "..to depart to their habitations, or to their lawful business..." ..given the magnificent volume of people so peaceably assembled here today... "..upon the pains contained in the Act made in the first year of King George for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies." God save the King! God save the King! That is for the Yeomanry, this is for Colonel L'Estrange. Somebody summon my man. Mandley! - Yes, sir? - Mandley. - Dispatches. - Be ready. Mandley. Time is of the essence. Well, stop fiddling, man, hurry! - The warrant, sir! - Mr Hulton, the warrant! Yes, gentlemen, I am well aware! - Henry Hunt. - John Knight. Johnson. Hulton, whatever actions we take here today will have serious repercussions thereafter. Mr Norris, please. I've no wish to find myself in the dock. The only people in the dock will be those blaggards. Here, I wish someone would tell him to speak up. Aye. I can't hear nowt. - Can you see owt? - Not really, no. - Where've thou come from? - Wigan. Oh, aye, that's a fair way. - Is this your brother? - Aye, he is. Aye, you can tell. You must have been up with the lark. Aye, set off at six. Have you not brought owt to eat? - No, we didn't think to. - Nah. Well, do you want some bread? - Oh, no, you're all right. - Aye, go on. You must be famished coming all t'way from Wigan. - You sure? - Aye. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. There you go, Mary. Pass that round. Save some for your father and Robert. That's if we ever see 'em again. - Gentlemen! - Men of the 15th! Mount Up! Mr Nadin! ..all the many and nefarious means - employed by those... - Nadin! - ..in authority to delay... - Show restraint. ..our harmonious assembly. But let me simply avow... ..that they have roundly failed! Mr Hunt. The Yeomanry is here. - This will not end well. - Mr Knight, please! And they will continue to fail... It's the Yeomanry. We must stick together and try not to be afeared. ..of peace... of unity and of hope... They're reprobates. Gentlemen... I ask you to give three cheers! - Huzzah! - Huzzah! - Huzzah! - Huzzah! - Hunt. - Huzzah! Henry Hunt. I hold a warrant for your arrest. You put this meeting and the lives of all those here... You'll come with me! Mr Hunt! - John! John! - Come with me! This is a peaceful protest! I am John Tyas of the London Times! I care not! Come on! Shame on you! Shame! Shame! God will judge you all! Get out of the way, you scum! What will we do? - What will we do? - Get her out, Mother. Come on, come on, move! Let's go. You will not silence me, sir. You will not silence me! My hat! Please, no! Please help me! - Get off me! - Come here! No! Shh, shh, shh. - Argh! - John, John! John, John! You should be ashamed of yourselves, you bastards! - Colonel L'Estrange! - Yes, sir? For God's sake, do something, man! - What am I to do? - Disperse the crowd! Cannot you see they are attacking the Yeomanry? - Sir. - On my count! Left! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Halt! Draw... swords! Troop will advance! Walk! March! Disperse the crowd! Forward! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Get back! Get back! Keep your line! - Back! Move! - Push them back! Move forward! Move forward! - Hold the line, gentlemen. - Get back! - Hold the line! - Get back! Hold the line! Hold the line! - Get back! - Dressing! Dressing, damn it. Dressing. - Get back! - Go on, get back. Clear out of the way! - Get back! - Keep the line! Keep the line! Get back! Get back! Get back! I know you! You're little Joe Lomax. Yah! You, sir, are a coward. Shame on you. Hah! Walk on. Just like him to go wandering off! - Stop mithering! - I'm not mithering, man! - I just want to know. - Shift, vermin. Shift. Bitch. You! Come here, you... Come here, you, you fat bitch! Yah! Yah! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hey! Soldier boy! Yargh! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Robert! Robert! Father! Robert! Robert! Robert! Robert! Get back! Argh! Mary! - I'm all right. I'm all right. - Mary, love. We've got you, son. For shame! Gentlemen, forbear! Forbear! The people cannot get away! - Come on, Sir Arthur! - Move ahead! - Bad luck, Byng! - Oh, dear, old chap. What a pity! Sir Arthur used to be a fine horse. - Indeedy! - Quite splendid he was. Please excuse me. Gentlemen, Lady Fitzwilliam. General. Not a happy soldier. John! How do you fare? I have been grossly mistreated, gentlemen. - You have indeed. - Horribly. - There will be repercussions. - There certainly will. This is carnage. It's but the beginning. We must report this heinous barbarism to the last detail. - We must. - We will. - When can you publish? - Wednesday morning. I shall take this afternoon's mail coach back to London. Gentlemen... good luck to you. - This is a battlefield. - Aye. A Waterloo on St Peter's Field. The Battle of Peter's Field. Peterloo. - The Battle of Peterloo. - That's it! No, the massacre. - The Massacre of Peterloo. - We must print that. Aye. I'll publish it in my next edition. So will I. Come... Let us take cover. Ah... - Oh! - Ah. Ah. - Un petit bonbon, Prince? - Ah, oui! - Ah... Oh. - Oh. Oh. Ah, Prime Minister, Home Secretary, m'dears. - Your Royal Highness. - Sir. Lady Conyngham. Gentlemen, pray rest your arses. You must be stiff after your journey. Lady Conyngham, I t-trust you've recovered from your... Stiff... I missed me morning swim! Indeed you did, my love. Ah... You swim, don't you, Liverpool? I fear not, sir. Ah. Sidmouth? Oh, no, of course you don't. Damn and blast this bloody business! Indeed, sir. It is a most regrettable circumstance. Regrettable, Liverpool? It's interminable! When will it ever end? Dear England! Whither... goest thou? My old heart aches. This sceptred isle. These pastures green. - Arcadia threatened. - Arcadia! Indeed, Lady Conyngham. Perfidious Albion doomed. Cursed by these malignant agents of m-m-malcontent. The creeping cholera of revolution. Damn it, it gets worse by the hour. I fear for me neck more than ever. - Oh! - God forbid, sir. Well... I know what is good for my people, better than they know themselves. We must not be held to ransom by the mob. - Indeed not. - Sir... there shall be no further insurrection in this l-land. Your government will ensure it. I thank ye. Gentlemen, I should like you to convey to the magistrates at... - Where? - Manchester. Yes, yes, of course, Manchester. Kindly inform them of my most gracious appreciation of their conduct, and of the great satisfaction I have derived from their prompt, decisive and effective measures... ..to preserve the public tranquillity. Tranquillity. - We shall, sir. - Indeed. Good. - To England! - To England! Tranquillity. Mm. I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, "Write, 'From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.' Even so," saith the Spirit, "for they rest from their labour." Lord have mercy upon us. Christ have mercy upon us. Lord have mercy upon us. Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
