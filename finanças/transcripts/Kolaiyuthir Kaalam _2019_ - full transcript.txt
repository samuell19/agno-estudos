Lawson Estate is Abha Lawson's and Charles Lawson's asset. Because of its amazing architecture it's been Sussex's historical site. Now the properties are under estate manager's control. Now he has to welcome the legal heir of the family and fulfill their expectations. [dog barks] James! Darla! Can you feed the dogs for me? I'm gonna go and pick some flowers for Shruti. -Yes, I will do that. -See you later. See you later. [dogs barking] Hey, guys! Dinner time. Hey! Here you go! [birds flap] Hello! Hello! Hey! Hey! This is private property. You should go then or I'll call the police. Hey! Don't touch! Would you like to have tea? It's there. Take it. It's good that you didn't go to pick Shruti. Glad! What do you mean? I know very well about your driving skills. Okay! Did you instruct our company driver properly? Yes! Perfectly! Shruti would have landed now, right? Yes, she would have landed. 'I, Abha Lawson, declare that my favourite, Shruti Lawson' 'will be the legal heir for our estate in Sussex and other properties.' 'And I also authorise Shruti' 'to take care of our charities.' 'After me, I believe that my Shruti' 'will permanently implement' 'Lawson family's goals' 'taking it on as her own ambition.' 'With Blessings, Abha.' Shruthi is a deaf and dumb by nature. And an orphan too. Her fate was completely rewritten when British citizen Mrs. Lawson adopted her. She strongly believed that one day she would also go to England. When she was a kid her cousin who visited England showed her the photos of Greeneries, farms and lock of sheep. As a small child from India she thoroughly enjoyed seeing those photos. that she never dreamed she would see in her lifetime. Now gates are opening for her Now she is visiting the UK and her property in Sussex. Mrs. Lawson handed everything to her. to take possession of the property. And to also start a new life. Today she is coming to the Lawson estate She is going to leave her life as an orphan without money and adapt to being the sole authority of all. But does she have the right in the estate... She's is here. Hey! Let her come. Shruthi is here... Yes, coming! Hi, Shruti! Welcome, Shruti! You have grown very big? Its cold enough .. !! Come. Shruti! Shruti! Why are you shouting? You know, she cannot hear, right? You can listen music, right? Wow! Mr and Mrs. Anand were waiting to see you. Can you come and meet them? Wow! A lip reader as well. [sighs] Fantastic! Come. Hi, Shruti! How are you? Shruti! It's something we have already spoken. We'll give two million pounds more than what we have discussed. It's a good deal you know? Accept it. Is she able to understand what I speak or not? Yes, she is very much. What ever you speak displays on her phone as a message. Not just that she knows lip movement as well. To read lips, she has to look at the face. Hey, Shruti! Abha aunty, who brought you up. My father's sibling. You may feel bad about whatever I speak. To be frank in her last stage of life she lost her memory. And she had no clue of what she was doing. Couldn't believe, right? I'm not saying anything new. I'm saying what had happened. But irritates me when you are not ready to understand and contempt whatever I say. Be quiet for a moment. Please... Sorry, Shruti. He is always like that. He doesn't know how to talk with others. I told him not come here. Didn't listen! Getting older. That's the reason. He never accepted you as one among this family. Do whatever you feel is correct. To be a trusty for Abha Estate... It's absolutely not a joke. It's a big responsibility. This estate, business tea estate in India, orphanages, and the dependent employees. Do you think you can handle all this? Please hold on. Sorry. You have just come. Go and take rest. What she has written there? Come, let's go. So what did she write? Do you think she would have said anything new? Whatever you get just like that will be ruined if you do not have the eligibility. Tell her. Please, leave it. Why should I? I have the rights by all means. I'm the legal heir. It's not worth talking about this now. Mrs. Lawson wrote the will long before. Shruti knows all about this. She doesn't know about me, or understand who I am. And given how little knowledge about me you're displaying, neither do you... I don't need to understand you. I have to fulfill her last wishes and that I'll do. Come, lets go. Nobody can save you. Greetings to all. We all are here to serve the people. We all run a charity trust First, would like to thank you all for the given oppurtunity to serve you as leader for sometime. When we were struggling to run the charity some supreme power showed us the person like Charles Lawson. Today, with his support only charities are running without any hassle. Whatever donation we receive today his contribution is more in that. During British rule Ribbon Lawson was ruling as governor for long term. When foreigner's were ruling us he is one among those who earned good name from the people. His only legal heir is Charles Lawson. He is the sole proprietor for 1000 crores. Good hearted people always complete their good deeds soon and go to God. Likewise, our Charlie also passed away at the young age. -After his demise -whatever donation we have been getting -Greetings. was stopped. He loved and married Ambika Bhargavi alias Abha who was an Indian Tamil girl. They had no heir. -Abha Lawson -Thanks. also agreed upon our request coming down here. Like her husband we also believe that she will also support our charity. Charles always used to travel. I didn't like that. Like other wives I also used to irritate him. He was a gem of a person. He returns only smile as a reply. I didn't realise that time. Behind his travel he had so much of service and affection. 15 Charitable Trust Three Old age home Two Medical centres, hundreds of orphan kids! No! God given kids!
