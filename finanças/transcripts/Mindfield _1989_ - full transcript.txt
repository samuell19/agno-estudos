Good afternoon, sir. Thank you. My God, Kellen, you look like hell. You like it? It's the new look since we've been on job action. - Are you guys going on strike? - There's talk of it. Kellen, I have a big audition at noon today, so I can't stay very long. Have you signed the divorce papers yet? Audition? What's the part? The violated ex-wife? Very funny... Have you signed them? Ron proposed. His name is Don. When's the big day? In two weeks. You're pregnant... So the doctor says: "Oh no, nurse, you got it all wrong! "I told you to slip off his spectacles!" - Rudy! How are you? - I'm aces, Leo. Hey! Good to see you. Hey! You and Bob should have come to Florida and talked to us there, where it's friendly. Yeah, and warm too. Eddie! Business has been good, huh? How's yours been, Leo? Tough, Eddie, like I said in the communication. As friends, we gotta be blunt. Bob and me, we got stiffed on the deal. The payments weren't supposed to quit after only 5 years. We did the papers, handled all the accounts... Did everything like we were supposed to! I've worked on some numbers here. One way to see it... It's like you boys built up some... some good investments off our unpaid accounts. Eddie! That marina in Orlando... It's worth more than ten... ten times this! Bill, you own a hotel or two. Two million, for Bob and me each. It's all we're asking. It's what you always wanted. Yes, it is. They're signed. Make sure I get a copy of the divorce decree. Alright. Come here. Oh, God. I'm happy for you. Thanks, Kellen. You're not taking care of yourself. - I'm fine. - I worry about you. Margot, I'm OK. - Let me get that. - No, this one's on me, OK? Kellen, I have to go. So ah... You take care, OK? OK. Bye. Where's the merchandise that you alluded to in your communiqu√©? Well, Bob is... Let's say... We can access it when we have to. - Access what? - This... this item. Remember, you called and wanted us to help get rid of everything. Well, we take everything out to the incinerator... except this particular item, which we found. The thing is, if anything happens to Bob or me, it follows like the night and day. The goodies will get into the wrong hands. How have you got that figured? I'm a little loath to go into details. - You're a little loath? - Uh-uh... Agh... Ah! Ah! Those are very well chosen words. You are a little loath, Leo. Do you realise what one does with little loaths? Little Jack Horner. This will make you better. Remember that he killed your father. Miss Paradis, this MK Ultra business, that was 25 years ago. There are no witnesses. Because the CIA won't reveal their names. You concede they have no documents? Because they destroyed them. Everything went through their shredders. I am bound by the law of state privilege. I cannot force their agents to answer your questions. We've been at this for 3 years! We haven't even set a trial date! Miss Paradis, that is hardly proper reply. You've made your case. My Lord, I have a client who suffers acute depressions almost every day, terrible black holes she can't escape from, nightmares so awful she's afraid of falling asleep. Now, the CIA funded Cold Haven and they paid that man to play with human brains. Your application is denied. This court is adjourned. Do you wish to completely ruin everything I have tried to do? My health patients program, my clinic for the children? If you'll excuse me, I have to talk to my clients. When those tiny things came to me, they were already damaged, neurotic... I tried to help them, you know this! Oh, save it for the witness stand, doctor. Oh no, no... I have read all about you in the magazines. I know very well your motives, left-leaning civil rights lawyer. And why is that your business? And why is my business yours... mademoiselle? Leo was a greedy man. What could suddenly have happened to make these visions start up again? I don't know. Well... Obviously, something that's buried is trying to make its way to the surface. It could be. - Margot getting remarried. - No. I told you something a long time ago, and it's still true. You're in a state of denial about your father's death. You're repressing something. Look. Let's talk a little bit about Cold Haven. You went there because there was trauma around your father's death. Holly, I volunteered to go there because they paid me. We didn't have enough money for my tuition. And you came out of there with this amnesia about your father. The time has come for us to talk about him. No. That's not the problem. - Kellen, look... - Holly, I've got to go. Let me do this my way. As your lawyer, I know it's not my place to advise you on legal tactics. But you're going to anyway. What I'm saying is we can't back down. We've made a threat and we have to make it good! Order, order... Please, order! So Kellen, then me. Work to rule, yes; As long as it takes. But I've got to say no to a walk. Kellen, she's right! You can't just let them get away with this! They've suspended 3 more men! If we don't go out, we lose credibility and we lose the struggle. What's this "we, we, we"? I don't see you offering to carry any picket signs. I've been working 20 hours a day. I'm not interested in having some bleeding heart left-wing lady lawyer telling me when to go on strike. Mr. O'Reilly, my politics are none of your goddamned business and you can keep the sexist crap to yourself. Excuse me. My mistake. I didn't mean to call you a "lady". Oh, I didn't come to sit here and listen while some macho arrogant bigot tries to smear me. Come on, we're all on the same side. There's no reason to yell at each other. - Goodnight. - Take it easy, guys. OK, try it! Good! Here you go. - Thank you. - Thanks. Can I give you a lift anywhere? No thanks. I'd like to walk. How's your court case going? - Which one? - The Cold Haven case. Your motion to examine the CIA. You've been following it? I read newspapers. Well, ah... I lost it today. About what happened upstairs, I uh... - Truce? - Truce. How about that ride? These... these must be mailed by the weekend. Oh! And my find me the Johnson file, please. I'm expecting a big fee this weekend. Maybe I could give you a raise. You'd like that, huh? A big raise from me, for Christmas. I'll just be a minute while they fill this prescription. I'll be right back. To refill. OK, everybody get down on the floor! Get down! You, get out from behind there! What's the matter with you, frizz face? You think you're so goddamned different? Get down on the floor! Faismoi pas mal! Get your ass on the floor, you stupid bitch! I'm just trying to help. Hey, you guys got a cigarette? We're right in front of the drugstore, buddy. I want everybody to take it easy. We're all gonna take it easy. I know how these things work. I'm a lawyer. We're gonna do what you say and everything's gonna be OK, right? Scott, there's almost nothing in here! Go through the lawyer's pockets. They always carry a lot of money. A lighter and 50 bucks! It's all I got on me! Oh! Hold it right where you are! Get your face on the floor! I said DOWN! Police! Now, don't move! I'm killing the girl! We'll kill all the hostages, in turn, starting in 5 seconds. Take the guy with the nose spray and then take the girl. Don't touch her! One hostage. OK. Take the guy. Why me? Why don't you take somebody else? Take her! I'm on your side! I defend guys like you! My name is Bob; Bob Champlain. Don't anybody get crazy here! I'm just gonna escort them out. Alright, move him out! We've got a vehicle outside. We're gonna hold him 'till we reach that vehicle. You make one move towards that door and you put a bullet in his brain. You understand? OK, move him out! OK, fatman, we're gonna find out where that key is. - Where's the key? - The key? Rudy? Rudy, is that you? Leo talked to us. Leo couldn't stop talking. Get in the car! Let's get out of here, now! Shoot him in the mouth, Mick. Where's the key? It's in my safe. I'm the only one who knows the combination. Let's go! Freeze! Relax guys. Lieutenant O'Reilly. Cordon this area off. : Maria? Maria! I've got her. Come on. Thank you. Maria, are you alright? - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm OK. You sure? Yeah, I'm OK! Can somebody sell me a pack of cigarettes? - Hey, Kellen! Way to go! - Thank you. Your heroics of last night leave me cold! An innocent hostage was killed. You literally handed him over to his murderers and I don't see how we can avoid an inquiry. Eugene, the lawyer was a small jobber for the mob. They were there to button him. The hold-up was just a cover for the operation. Lieutenant, you still have this fixation on Sicilian conspiracies. Eugene, I don't have a fixation. They were looking for something on him... a key. Get in here. Kellen, listen. Don't use my first name in front of the chief. It's Captain. You're being a little precious, aren't you? Eugene, we used to be partners, remember? You used to piss your pants every time I turned on the siren. And you're still in the car, turning on sirens, when you're not organizing strikes. What's this about a work stoppage Monday night? You guys know that's illegal! It's not a strike. It's a special meeting of the membership. It's allowed under the contracts. Your father would turn over in his grave. He was a loyal cop, whatever they say about him. Sit down. Well, lieutenant, I have to make a statement about this business of last night. The press thinks you're a hero. I have some doubts. I think you're trigger-happy. I think you endangered people's lives, your own included. But I'm going to go along with "hero". No inquiry this time. Thank you, Captain. Are you feeling alright? I'm OK. Why did you take the chance, Kellen? I don't know. What was the take on this? It's under 3000 bucks. Three grand? Junkies hit pharmacies. These guys were professionals. This is the kind of operation you mount for a bank. He just said that he was expecting a big fee. Enemies? Maybe. He was a shyster. Do you know what he kept in here? He never let me see. Do you know the combination? No, I don't know it. - Goddammit... - Are you OK? This was cut with a laser. Therese wouldn't like me looking at this stuff. Juley the Juice. Mafia... Juley, catch! What's this? Well... What have we told you about girls, Juley? Come on, dumb truck, get out! Get out! This is a respectable establishment. - "Respectable!" - Pff... Come on, what do you expect? They sneak in here with their tricks. What am I supposed to do? Juley, that wouldn' happen to be one of Johhny Ronce's little girls, would it? Come on, lieutenant... Johnny insists. What am I gonna do? I'm like between a rock and a hard place. Yeah, well we got a hard place for you, complete with rock. And stay out! Now come on, lieutenant. What's this about? I help you guys out. I hear a good customer of yours got hit, Juley. - Yes, I heard too. Bob the lawyer. - That's right. Oh no... No, boys. He was just a customer of mine. He bought one of my blow dolls, as a matter of fact. That's not good enough, Juley. He was close with some of the boys. He dicked too many jobs. He wound up hustling clients at a bus stop. That's all I know. Your only connection to him was selling him this sick shit? This is not sick shit. He was a good customer. You buy 50 bucks worth of stuff, you get one of these, with a little advertisement on it. Why do you think he got hit? No idea. The Gallows from Brooklyn, they've been pretty busy. - Can I use your phone? - Yep. Juley, you've got friends - from out of town. - So? So I hit one of them in his gun hand and he's gonna need a doctor. Now who's looking after Johnny girls? - I don't know. - No? I don't know! The last one he was using died in an alcohol clinic. - You're bullshitting me! - No, I'm not! Section 193... Operating a body house. Jeez, OK! OK! I'll find out what I can. Good. Can I help you with that, sir? Just follow me. Well alright, that'll be $16. - I'll be needing this. - Yeah. And 4 make 20. And thank you very much. Alright, we'll be right down. Station said they just got a dead body; An accountant by the name of Leo Sloukos. Leo? You know him? Um... He just did some numbers for Johnny. - So have you ever been married? - Oh yeah. Well, when did it end? About 4 years ago. Divorced? Actually, I signed the papers yesterday. Well... Here's to being a statistic, lieutenant. So why did you become a cop? Tradition, I guess. Your dad was on the force? - Yeah. - Is he retired now? He's dead. Murdered. Shot on duty. Oh, I'm sorry. It's history. I don't like talking about it. "The CIA murdered Chili. "Your country could be next." Oh, that man! I'm gonna drag Satorius to the courts backwards if I have to. Satorius had this theory that you could cure a neurotic by wiping out their memory. He called it "de-patterning". Produce the blank mind with electroshock, then create the new improved you with psychic driving. You know what that is? That's when he strapped them to tables, he hit them up with LSD and he burned their brains. I was at Cold Haven. Right. Neighbourhood's good. I've been here about 7 years. There's talk of it being a co-op. Oh yeah? You're gonna buy? I might. Can I? Oh, thanks. How about an Irish coffee? How about straight caffeine? Let me get some of this stuff. Do you mind? The office sometimes calls. Oh. Hi, Raolo here. See you tomorrow if you're still on for some tobogganing with the kid. It's my partner. Hi uncle, it's Mario! We're still going together tomorrow? Who's Mario? He's my godson. Hi, Kellen. I just got back from the audition. I don't know... I really want to get this film, you know? It's my ex. She's an actress. She doesn't sound very "ex". OK... Bye. How are you doing, anyway? Hope you're OK. She invites me to her weddings. Uhhuh... She's an actress. What are you doing to me? I don't want to kill! No! Please! No, no, no... Bring him back. Are you OK? I'm not ready for you yet. Hey, I'm here. I'm here... Are you alright? I lose my sight. I get images. It's not very nice. I'm here, OK? It's alright. There's a fairly strict policy of mental health on the police force. They take a rather dim view of any kind of psychotic behaviour. You're the only one that knows; You and Holly Mandel, my shrink. And even, her I've only told half-truths to. What about Margot? Margot... She knew something was wrong. You still care about her? Yeah, I still care about her. My father was my hero. When he was doing split shifts, I used to get up in the morning and make his toast for him. I was at college. That's where I got introduced to Satorius. Therapy was drugs and electroshock. I don't even remember my father's death. It's just this hole; Those images. I think it's... something from the past trying to make its way to the surface. The other day in the pharmacy, when I shot that guy... It was like there was another man inside me. There was this urge to kill. Kellen... You should testify. : Mario! : Don't run! Mario! - How are you doing? - Fine. You? - I'm fine. How is school? - Fine. - Just fine? - Just fine. I hear you aced the grammar test. What's it like to kill a man? You're going tobogganing like that? Kellen, you're not ready. Uh... Hi, I'm Raolo. Sarah Paradis. I'm Therese. Nice to meet you. - This is Mario. - Mario, give me five. Uh... We can do this some other day. Sarah, hold on. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. - Sarah... - Bye-bye. O'Reilly here. - It's Juley the Juice. - He's got something? My God, here we go again... OK... Two guys, one of them with a bandaged hand, showed up on Friday night at a club called Sextasy. A doctor named Tom Luk has set up an office there. He's an ex Saigon doctor whom Johnny helped with his papers and stuff. He checks Johnny's girls for the clap. Now, the impression that I get is that the 2 guys are friends with a family from down south; New Orleans, Atlanta, something like that. That's it? That's everything? That's it. That's everything. What do you want me to do? Tell Johnny and the boys I'm helping out the bulls and that I want the total dope on everyone? Juley, think of it as a license to pimp. Mario! Therese, look, we're not gonna be able to make it today. Can you drop Kellen and I downtown? I thought this was your day off! You're supposed to be his father, but when in the hell do you ever see him? Find your own way downtown! Dr. Luk... Hi! Oh, thanks! Ah! Che Cazzo? Ges√π Cristo! Easy, boys! Mr. Ronzorelli. Hey, Raolo, I like you! You got personality, a sense of humor... A shotgun. What are you guys jerking off back there? It could have been Iranian assassins! Hey, order a girl over here! Well, it's a pleasure to be your host on this tranquil Sunday. Oh, Johnny, I needed this. Hey, listen, it's like a reward. You bust ass all week. Don't lose hope. You got to relax a bit at the end. How's your health, O'Reilly? I heard you were in a gunfight? Yeah, which brings up a question. Johnny, friends come to you. One of them's been shot. Where do you send them? To the emergency. I call an ambulance like any normal citizen. I just came from Dr. Luk's office. Dr. Luk? I can't say he's a gentleman of my acquaintance. This could be hotter. Do you like it hotter, Johnny? Do you like heat? Do you like your job? You want I should call the complaint department? You recall, maybe, the incidents surrounding the last time you tried to hassle me? They strung him up, Johnny; Tried to make it look like a suicide, these friends of yours from the States. - What, my new croaker? - Uh-huh. Signore Ronzorelli, chi sono? Yeah, well that's what I'd like to find out! Even though you come into my athlete's club and lay threats on me, even though I don't like you, I will say I respect you as a person of integrity in this community. Off the record, no subpoenias. Capiche? I'm doing a favor of my free will. I understand. Let's say, figuratively, I've got these acquaintances in Miami. I owe them a favor, so they call me up and here's the favor: Find a doctor for some unnamed individual with a bullet. These friends from the States, is it possible that they trace their origins back to the old country? No, they're friends. If they was family, think I'd waste breath on a civil servant? These things are best left to the private sector. Kellen, you have to testify. Yeah... I'll go in to work now and say: Captain, sir, I need the afternoon off. You see, I'm going to court to tell them I'm having acid flashbacks. Look, it's not about indicting you. It's about indicting Satorius. But I'll be there, Sarah. It will be my ass. You're a detective. You've testified before. They'll crucify me in the witness stand! Crucify you... is that all you care about, is you? What about my clients? You know, Kellen, they're good people and they have balls enough to stand up and be counted. I'm a good person. You stop playing goddamned games with my life! Merry Christmas... Commercial crime says there's a safe deposit box. Oh yeah? Where? Trust company, Sherbrooke St. West. I phoned. Thanks, but no thanks. So do you think we should do? Get a search warrant or what? No, we don't want a search warrant. It'll take too long. Hey, you guys. I want you to meet someone. Special agent Hugh McVeigh, FBI. Lieutenant-detective Kellen O'Reilly. Detective Raolo Basutti. Hope you fellow pokers don't think I'm butting in. Agent McVeigh's been tracking your killers, gentlemen. The main man is Woody Myers, ex counterfeiter with heavy mafia connects who's been using the continent to trade arms for coke. You got any artwork on these guys? He works with the family Delgado out of Miami. They had a lawyer and accountant here in Montreal. - Our bodies, gentlemen. - The accountant and lawyer made a real bad mistake. Blackmail. - Where are they now? - State side. Flew back last night. You have it gentlemen. They're no longer in our jurisdiction. Matter goes over to the feds. RCMP and FBI. So, you're off the case. Thanks, Eugene. Champlain RW. I have a box here. Do you have identification, Mr. Champlain? - Yes, Ma'am. Oh! - Oh, dear. It's my mother's. Promised her I'd keep it safe. - This is quite lovely. - Yes, it was a gift for her. She's always losing things, she has... Alzheimer's. Oh. There you go. Thank you. Here you are, Mr. Champlain. Thank you. You know, Kel, wait a minute. Now, Borco's gonna have our nuts and to be honest with you, it's starting to smell like an RCMP case, you know? Screw the Mounties. You want out? No. - Where are we going? - Your theatre's closed, Julie. Sanitary inspection. Anyone comes in... I'll confiscate your blow dolls. When do you guys go on strike? I can't wait! Here we go! What is this stuff? - Not yet, Mick! - He walked in before I could stop him. Alright. Bring him in, Mick. What are you doing to me? I don't want to kill! - That guy looks like you, Kel. - It is me. I am not ready for you, yet. Let me get this straight: You went to this Cold Haven place and then you like... wiped your memory clean or something? I tried. But you're OK now. I've... had a few head problems over the years. But you're alright, I mean... Doesn't matter. Let's get this in before we damage it anymore. What do you mean, to this station? To Borco. I I'm with you. Thanks. Get down! Ugh! Agh! Don't try it! Don't. ¬∂¬∂Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh¬∂ ¬∂ Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ¬∂ ¬∂ Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ¬∂¬∂ With all these experiments with guns and mirrors. I think we want you to take some medical tests. Oh, Eugene. You officious bureaucratic son of a bitch. I saw the goddamn film. Medical tests? Are you kidding me? You sure you don't have this so-called film? You're not keeping any secrets from us? Me? Keep secrets? Who are you sharing secrets with, Eugene? The whole goddamn world including your pal - in the CIA? - McVeigh? - Yeah! - He's FBI. I saw his... What the hell is going on? Another man shot? I thought you were off this case! Now one of our officers died. How do you feel about that? He was my partner... But you wouldn't understand that would you, asshole? They murdered him. I'm going to bury those sons of bitches. Eugene. Alright, here's the bottom line. We know you're seeing a psychiatrist. We've um... we know you've been hallucinating. You've had me under investigation. We think you're having a nervous breakdown. You lied about your medical history. So what? We'll need a service revolver. You're suspended. That's bullshit. Give him the gun. Put it in your goddamn collection, Eugene. Kellen, I don't know what you're talking about. It was an experiment. I saw myself on film! They've done something to me. I had that son of a bitch Satorius on film. It... got lost in the explosion. Those bastards still think I've got the film. Kellen... I want you to go to the meeting with me, OK? You'll be with your friends there and you'll be safe. Look. All I've got is my word. No evidence. Just pieces of memory coming back. OK, but where are you going? I'm going to get my memory back. Will you just stop it! Hey c'mon O'Reilly. Give it a break. I've always been straight with you. Keep moving. I want to see the warrant. Hey! - Warrant? - Yeah, warrant. You must really trust your neighbours, Benny. Don't move. What do we got here? Crank? Smack? What's this? Blow. What else you got? A lawyer. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Hey! Agh! I don't have time to screw around. Do you have any acid? Any LSD? Hey, man. You know I got it all in the fridge. In the damn fridge. Kellen's father died when he was 9 years old. He had shot an unarmed man and there was going to be an inquiry, but he killed himself and it was Kellen who found his body. He committed suicide? Yes. He told me he was murdered. Oh no. No, he committed suicide. Well, does he really not remember or is he just trying to cover up? Oh, he absolutely does not remember. Satorius did some experiments linking LSD with memory. Did they ever work? I know that no matter who conducted those experiments, they're totally irresponsible. ¬∂¬∂¬∂ Wha... Huh... Wow... Like you're on top of the world, dontcha? This is O'Reilly. I'm not home right now, so leave a message. : Hi. Kellen? It's me. This is amazing! I... I don't believe it. I... I guess it's true. I've got the film. I'm still in shock. I... I've got to see you if that's OK with you. Kellen, I got the lead. "MKUltra." Good evening, Mr. O'Reilly. Yes. Now, you know, don't you? All the information was removed from your memory. But it seems to me, coming back. - You son of a bitch! - 1949, they summoned me to Budapest. They wanted me to break the mental defenses of one... Jozsef Cardinal... Mindszenty. I did. He confessed his crimes. His crimes. So, the company... rescued me from Hungary. The company gave me Cold Heaven, and money, and the tools to fight communism, and I gave 20 years of my life to the company. Hard years, hard work on the frontlines of the Cold War, but... winning... ...without killing, Mr. O'Reilly. Is that not humane? Not to take lives, but to alter minds? This is how all wars will be fought one day. No, you want to change people, so they can kill. You came close, Mr. O'Reilly, but you failed the last test. The rebel inside you refused to die. - Ah... - And a policeman now. - Yeah, I'm a cop. - I wouldn't have believed it. But then, it is a debt to your father - yes? - that you think you owe? No. Ugh! He killed himself. Yes. You don't know this. With a bullet through the brain. Remember that he killed your father. He was murdered. You see, he shot a man in the back. But of course, you have been programmed to block this, to deny the truth. Mental surgery, if you like. Does what I say cause you pain, Mr. O'Reilly? - Yes. - Well, it causes pain, because it's the truth. No. No, you're not a killer. : You. Ugh! Well, Gregor, you said that you could elicit the information the easy way. Now, it must be hard. It's great. You're sure that's him? Quite a number, huh? That's him. I checked it. OK, thanks. Hi, Sarah. - Hi. - Cop killed, so there's going to be trouble tonight. Some of the men want to go back on the job to find those guys. Where's Kellen? I don't know. He was suspended. Suspended!? Suspended Kellen O'Reilly!? All evidence was to have been destroyed. You said you burned everything. You should have trusted my work. We will erase from his memory everything he saw on the computer, everything. And I want no killings. Someday, we must tell the world what we have done. The world must never be told, Gregor. That's my job. Eddie, help the doctor set up the ECT room. - Strike! Strike! - Strike! Strike! Strike! - Strike! - We're doing this... We're doing this for families like Raolo's. A cop is dead and his killers are still loose. Now, I have a motion to adjourn. Will you accept it or not? I'm not accepting it. Please, quiet! I'm not accepting it. We won't adjourn. - The assembly will go on! - No! Now, repeated shocks can cause brain death, but it's more likely that the heart will crash first. Death is such a wasteful thing. All we need to extinguish is recent memory. It's a... a democratic choice. We can extinguish your life or just one bad day in it. Now, come on, O'Reilly, you're not gonna miss just one bad day. We're offering you a chance to live, please help us. We know that Ms. Paradis has the film. - Sarah. - Yeah, I heard her on the phone. Where did she hide it? What are you guys talking...? I'll get out of that. No, no, Myers, they will chase you... Shut up! Mr. Sloukos had to suffer before he passed away. How did Champlain and Sloukos get the film!? They were gonna split the money three ways. A third for the silent partner, right? You see what he's trying to do? No. I have proof. Your name on documents in Champlain's safe. Ugh! He won't be playing those games. Yes, Gregor, but will he remember where the film is? After all, he's lost a day in his life, he won't be much use to us like this. I wish we had our last words to say over again. Raolo... was proud to be a cop. I am very proud of him. For being a cop. For everything. But I swear to God, my son will never become a policeman. Tell it to the world now, Gregor. He burns the doctor, then he shoots himself. Do you understand? Like father, like son. Ironic justice. Hurry it up. Hear that, pal? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ah... you're gonna blow yourself away. Then we're gonna do your card-carrying lawyer friend. Idiot! Those who are in favour of the prolongation of the meeting and the walkout until 6 o'clock tomorrow morning, for? Against? That's it! You're on strike! Damn! I can't get a line out. Oh. Oh. Oooh... Police. Sir, unless it's an emergency... Well, just tell them to turn their amplifier down. Police. You're going to talk outside with me. You're not to do any talking. I don't want to hurt you.
