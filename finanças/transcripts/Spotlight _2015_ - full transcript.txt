Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick How's that going? The mother's bawling and the uncle's pissed off. She's not married? Divorced with four kids. I guess Father was helping out. Helping out? Hey, Mr. Burke, they're in back talking to the bishop. And Father? We put him in the break room. Any press? Some guy from the Citizen but we sent him away. None of the big papers. Let's keep it that way. Who's that? Assistant DA. It's gonna be hard to keep the papers away from the arraignment. What arraignment? You can tell Father Geoghan it won't be much longer. Now, Sheila, you know what good work the church does in the community. But I give you my personal guarantee that I'm going to take Father out of the parish, and this will never happen again. We'll just be another moment, Paul. Of course, Father. Now, Sheila, I'm going to give you my personal card... Losing a good reporter is always tough. But losing one of our best... Well, to put it as eloquently as I can, it's a real kick in the ass. But, Robby here has known Stewart longer than most of you have been alive, so, I'll hand it off to him. Robby. Oh, well, thanks, Ben. I think. Although I take issue with your reference to my seniority, I will say that Stewart's departure is especially painful for me because, uh... For what, Stewart? Twenty years now? Stewart's been more than willing to part with his money at the poker table. And I've got a kid in college. Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing. Oh, problem solved. Godspeed then. Now, Stewart, I find the timing of your departure disconcerting. The corner office sits empty, the new editor arrives on Monday, so I'm sorry, buddy, but I gotta ask ya. What the hell do you know? How's the cake? It's really good. Are you saving yours? Nah, it's for Mike. I can never eat at those things. They kind of depress me. I know. Did you see the numbers from Washington? Yeah. Very interesting. I think so, too. I'm not asking if the PD's lying, I know they're lying. All I'm asking, who's behind it? Oh. Okay, I get it. You don't want to talk. No, Dan, I'm not mad, I'm hungry. I've been talking here so long I didn't eat lunch. So I'm gonna go get something to eat, and that'll give you an hour to decide whether you want to be on the right side of this or read about it like everybody else. Bye, Dan. You think Cahill has something? Maybe. I just don't think the story's for us. Ben likes it. Yeah, it's not bad, it's just not Spotlight. What's just not Spotlight? The PD numbers. The numbers story. It feels thin. Oh, you got Cahill to talk? No, but I will. Good. Then we'll know if it's thin. - How'd it go upstairs? - Oh, okay. - Robby gave a good speech. - Sure he did. I heard Lubin and Connor are going to the Times. - Come on, really? - Yeah, I heard that. They're leeching us. Well, at least they're sending us a guy from Miami to run things. That should help. Has Baron even spent time in Boston? I don't think he's ever been here before. Maybe we should buy him a map. I have a friend down in Miami said he cut 15% of the staff. Great... Hey, Robby. New boss coming in to make some cuts? I have no idea. Aren't you sitting down with him? Yes, I am. So is it about Spotlight? I don't know, Mike, but I do know that Ben needs an answer on the crime numbers story. I'm telling you, I really don't think that story's for us. Mr. Baron. Walter Robinson. Robby. Thanks for taking the time out of your weekend. Oh, my pleasure. Appreciate it. What are you reading? Uh... The Curse of the Bambino. Oh, yeah, it's a great book. The Globe has season tickets at Fenway once you're settled in, by the way. Thank you. Uh, to be honest, I'm not much of a baseball fan. I'm just trying to get a feel for the city. Oh, yeah... So you're originally from Boston? I am. Born and raised, yeah. A lot of the newsroom is from here. It really feels like a local paper in that way. And did that change at all after the paper was sold to the Times? No. No, I don't think that had a big impact. Good. And you're an editor for the Spotlight team? I'd prefer to think of myself as player coach. But yes. Are you familiar with Spotlight? No, not particularly. Well, we are a four-person investigative team. We report to Ben Bradlee, Jr., and we keep our work confidential. What're you working on now? We just put out a piece on a shoddy construction outfit, and right now we're really just trolling around for our next story. How long does that typically take? Hard to say. A couple months. Couple months? Yeah, we don't like to rush it. Once we settle on a project, we can spend a year or more investigating it. Is that a concern? Not necessarily. Um, but from what I understand readership is down, Internet is cutting into the classified business, and. I think I'm gonna need to take a hard look at things. So, do you anticipate more cuts? I think it's safe to assume so, but what I'm more focused on right now is finding a way to make this paper essential to its readers. I like to think it already is. Fair enough. I just think that we can do better. Mr. Bradlee. Hey. Saw the PD numbers. Looks interesting. Yeah, there's something there. How long do you need? Another week. Where're you going? 10:30. Since when? Technically, I am an editor. Technically. Your sit-down with Baron go that well? I couldn't get a read on him. That's a first. How about you? Oh, he's a barrel of laughs. Morning, everyone. Let's get started. Do you wanna say something, Marty? Uh, sure. Uh, hello. As most of you know by now, my name is Marty Baron, I'm delighted to be here. Um, if you could tell me your name as we go around, that'd be helpful. Thank you. Okay. Peter? Peter Canellos, Metro. I've got a major Big Dig closure. Hey, Steve. Hey. Mike. Crappy game last night, huh? Yeah, they can't hit worth a nickel. Hey listen, what's Eileen McNamara doing in the 10:30? Do you need something, Mike? No, just curious. Go be curious somewhere else. I got work to do, huh? Okay, Steve. See you. Yeah. And it looks like Pedro's gonna be out until September 1st. Jimmy says he'll be back this year, but the doc didn't seem so sure. When's the Pats' opener? Is that everyone? Yes, that's it. Okay. Good. Thank you. Uh... Did everyone read Eileen McNamara's column this weekend? That's the Geoghan case? Yeah, what's the folo on that? It's a column, what kind of folo were you thinking? Uh, well, apparently this priest molested kids in six different parishes over the last 30 years, and the attorney for the victims, Mr... Garabedian. Thanks, Eileen. Mr. Garabedian says Cardinal Law found out about it 15 years ago and did nothing. Yeah, I think that attorney's a bit of a crank, and the church dismissed the claim. He said, she said. Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or not he says he has documents that prove the cardinal knew. As I understand it, those documents are under seal. Okay, but the fact remains, a Boston priest abused 80 kids, we have a lawyer who says he can prove Law knew about it, and we've written all of, uh, two stories in the last six months. This strikes me as an essential story to a local paper. I think at the very least, we have to go through those documents. How would you like to do that? Oh, uh... I don't know what the laws are here, but in Florida we would go to court. You want to sue the church? Technically we wouldn't sue the church. We'd file a motion to lift the seal on those documents. The church will read that as us suing them. So will everybody else. Good to know. Gutsy call for the first day. That's one word for it. How do you think that's gonna play down front? I think Gilman's gonna shit a brick. Hey. Door. How'd it go? Well, Baron wants to sue for the sealed docs in the Geoghan case. Wants to sue the church? Hey, that's great. We covered Geoghan when the story broke three years ago. Baron was still in Miami. I think he might have been at the Times then, actually. He wasn't here. So do you think that suit has a chance? Depends on the judge. And what parish he belongs to. Bradlee. Yeah. Okay. Baron wants to talk to us. Us? Okay, Jon. Thank you. Yes. Okay, thanks. I've set up a meeting for tomorrow with outside counsel. Jon Albano? Yeah. Who's the judge in this case? Um... Constance Sweeney. Tough. Why's that? Good Catholic girl. Huh. So, um, judging from what I've read, it doesn't seem like we've done a very thorough investigation into the Geoghan case. Is that right? No, it's not. We looked hard at Geoghan. David Armstrong from Metro, Michael Paulson for Religion. Okay, but, uh, just so I understand, beyond our daily coverage, we haven't... We haven't committed any long-term investigative resources to the question of whether or not Cardinal Law knew about this? No, we haven't. And that's the kind of thing your team would do? Spotlight? Well, yeah. But we're still prospecting the Boston PD story I told you about. Could you set that aside? We could. Marty, in past Spotlight's had success in large part because they pick their own projects. Would you consider picking this one? I don't know if he's writing about you, but I will let him know you called. Okay, bye. Hey. Hey, how'd it go? Okay. Uh... Baron wants us to scrub the Geoghan case. That's great. Didn't we cover Geoghan? Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging Cardinal Law knew about it. - Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right? - Yeah. I covered him at the courthouse. Can you get to him? I only interviewed him once. He's kind of a character. I like characters. I'll take him. Good. You take him. Also, we should be talking to, uh, the lawyer who repped the victims in the Porter case. Eric Macleish. Uh-huh. That guy was always on TV. Yeah, the Porter case? Remind me. Yeah, um, Father Porter, similar story. Molested dozens of kids in Fall River about 10 years ago. So, we're dropping the Boston PD? I vote yes. No, no. We just gotta set it aside for now. Listen, I don't need to tell you guys this. We need to be more discreet than usual. All right? Everybody's gonna be interested in this, not just the Herald. We can't let Cardinal Law get wind of this until we know what we have. Good luck with that. So when do you leave, Nana? The bus is picking us up in the church parking lot at 9:00. We have 40 people going. And is Father Dominic going? No, he says he's unlucky. But luck has nothing to do with it. You know, last time Nana won $160. Wow. You gonna tell her? We don't even know if there's a story yet. Well, "Globe sues church"? It's gonna be a story. Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the relevant clips on that for me? Yeah. Is this for Spotlight? Just drop them off when they're ready? Thanks. Excuse me, do you know where the publisher's office is? Will do. How are you, Marty? Settling in? Yeah, I think so. Good. What can I do for you? Um... I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case. You want to sue the Catholic Church? Um... We're just filing a motion, but... Yes. You think it's that important? Yes, I do. Because obviously the Church will fight us very hard on this. Which won't go unnoticed by our subscriber base. 53% of them are Catholic. Mmm-hmm. I think they'll be interested. Okay. Marty, Lake Street will probably contact you about a face-to-face with the Cardinal. It's customary. Yeah. They already have. It's set up for next week. I wouldn't mention this. Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Oh, hi. I'm Mike Rezendes from The Boston Globe. I'm here to see Mitchell Garabedian. He's on a call. Please have a seat. Okay. All right, I'm listening. Go ahead. Okay. Bill! Where the hell are those papers? I asked you to put 'em on my desk! The famous Walter Robinson in my conference room. Good to see you again, Eric. Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric Macleish. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You don't play golf, do you? Uh, no. Good. Your colleague here took some money off me at a charity event last year. It was a very lucky putt. I actually had my eyes closed, by the way. Mmm-hmm. So, how can I help you guys? Uh... You're familiar with the Geoghan case? Sure. Eighty plaintiffs. All of them individual cases. Garabedian must be swimming. Well. And the allegations against Cardinal Law? Yeah, it's tricky. Um... This is what you need to understand. These are shitty cases. The statute of limitations is only three years, and most of these victims don't come forward until long after that. Oh. Why is that? Well, they're kids, you know. Guilt, shame. And most of these kids come from tough neighborhoods. Nobody wants to admit this kind of thing. So, you're screwed on the time limit. And, uh, even if you argue your way around that the charitable immunity statute caps damages at 20 grand. Twenty grand for molesting a child? That is the way the system is set up. Yes. The Church is tough. So, your best shot is to try these cases in the press like I did on Porter. Hmm. But, you know, most of the victims, they don't wanna have anything to do with TV. And, uh, Mitch isn't exactly a people person. Yeah, and if Garabedian can't get his victims to go before the press, then he's really... That's right. He has a long road ahead of him. My guess is he doesn't have anything on Law. What? You think he's bluffing or... I think he's grandstanding to cut a better deal. Seems a bit reckless. Have you met Mitch Garabedian? I asked you to write up that motion, Bill. I didn't ask you to file it. Hey, Bill, here's the case files from yesterday. Hi. Who are you? I'm Mike Rezendes from The Boston Globe. I had an appointment with you about an hour ago. I can't talk to you. I'm very busy. Sharon! No, no. She went out for coffee. She said she'd be right back. I'm following up on an article. The one in the Phoenix? No. In the Globe. Did you see the one in the Phoenix? No, I didn't. I thought it was very good. I have a copy here somewhere. That's all right. I'll track it down. I'm actually following up on a column that Eileen McNamara wrote about your suit. Suits. There are 84 of them. It's not a class action. You should get your facts straight. No, you're right. I should. So I'm trying to get some background information on... You're not recording this, are you? No, I wouldn't do that without asking. I can't show you those Church's documents if that's what you're after. They're under seal. Yeah, I know that. Did you know that they tried to bring me up before the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers three times? They're watching me very closely. The Church? Yeah. The Church. Yeah. They'd like to get me disbarred. In fact, put that away. Put it away. Sure. I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form. Not on paper, not on tape, nothing. In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you. So... Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's things you cannot tell me, but I also know there's a story here. And I think it's an important story. I already talked to the Phoenix. Yeah, and there's a reason I didn't see it. Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore. They're broke. They don't have any power. The Globe does. If we cover this story, everybody will hear about it. The Church thinks in centuries, Mr. Rezendes. Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on? Yeah, I do. But if you don't mind me asking, do you? I can't talk to you right now, Mr. Rezendes, I'm very, very busy. Sharon? Yeah. Thank you. Can I at least talk to some of your clients? The victims? I'd really like to do that. Call me tomorrow, I gotta think about it. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, yeah. I got more clips from the library. Leave 'em right there. Are you guys doing a story on the Church? No, we are not doing a story on the Church. Matt, you find anything on this guy, Phil Saviano? No. Who is he? He's part of a victims' organization. Kurkjian did a story on him right after the Porter case. There's a victims' organization? Yeah, it's called SNAP. It's Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. - Crummy acronym. - Hmm. You want me to track him down? Yeah. Bring him in. How much longer you need to get through the clips? I mean, a few days. There's a lot. Lisa's still sending up more. Okay. Hey, guys. I think I got another priest. Liam Barrett. Molested some kids in Philly and was moved to Boston. Did the same thing and was moved again. Really? That sounds like Geoghan. Is that one of our clips? Yeah. Byline's Diego Ribadeneira, 1997. Must've been back when he was working Religion. Was there any folo? Not much. One short piece. Huh. The Church settled the case. Don't you know Jim Sullivan? Yeah. Why? Looks like the Church brought him in to help out. Jesus... Has anybody but Manny gotten the ball out of the infield? Nope. Why do you even bother with that thing? It distracts me from the game. Know what else is good for that? Oh, yeah. Good idea. My round. I'll be right back. Anybody want any food? No. I'm all set. Hey, a hot dog. So you guys making any progress? Absolutely. It's a good story. Why? Because you're another lapsed Catholic pissed off at the Church? We've got a lot of good stuff. Like what? I'm just watching the game. Omertà. They got another priest, Liam Barrett. We reported on him. I'm just saying, we did. Okay, but this guy was shuffled around from parish to parish every few years, just like Geoghan and Porter. I think there's a pattern. Sounds thin. What else you got? Sacha's got another guy from a victims' organization, Phil Saviano. From SNAP? Oh, boy. We reported on him, too. I thought you were watching the game, Steve. That guy's pretty banged up, Mike. We did a couple stories on him. That guy would not stop writing letters. He wants a holy war. What? So he's not worth talking to? Where are you on Garabedian? I'm working on it. Robby said Macleish thinks he's bluffing. I think there's something there, Ben. Get me something solid, or I'm taking you off it. I don't want us chasing our tails on this. Stay away from that trap. You couldn't reach that trap in a million years, partner. I've reached that trap before. Yeah? Now Paul, maybe. - How we doing? - We're good. We're two up in the front. Good. How's that new editor working out? Well, he doesn't like baseball. But he seems like a smart guy. Yeah, I read an article about him. Said he's the first Jewish editor at the Globe. Must have been a slow news day. He got a family, this guy? No. He is not married. Divorced? I don't think so, no. So the new editor of the Globe is an unmarried man of the Jewish faith who hates baseball? Yeah. Should have given it to Ben. He's a Bradlee, for crying out loud. Didn't raise his hand fast enough, I guess. Hey, by the way, I've been reading about this priest, Father Barrett. Said you were involved with that. Barrett, yeah. Bad egg. Lake Street asked for help, I pitched in. Victims said Cardinal Law knew about Barrett when he came from Philly. Is that true? You know I can't talk about the case, Robby. Off the record? Off the record I can't talk about it. All right. This related to the lawsuit? You know about that? Look, I don't know this guy Baron or what his agenda is. Frankly, I don't care. I just don't want to see you taking a bullet for him. I think you're away. Put it over here. Let's go. Let's go. So the other day I was on the World Wide Web. Anything you want to know. It's right there. Now, I have to admit that as a priest, this makes me a little nervous. Should I be worried about job security? I don't think so. You see, knowledge is one thing, but faith... Faith is another. Hey. Hey. Shouldn't you be golfing or something? Golfing's not a verb. And I couldn't get a tee time. Is that what they call it? "Tee time"? They also call it "a leisure activity." You ought to try it, Mike. I do. I run. Yeah, you run to work. So why are you here today? Going over these clips of Saviano. Yep, Ben and Steve think it's a dead end. They gave me a bunch of crap about it at the game. Yeah, Ben emailed me. He did? Yeah. He said we should let it go. What do you wanna do? I wanna bring Saviano in. So, just ignore those guys? I think we've got to start ignoring everybody on this one. I'm good with that. Mmm. Do you think Marty has any idea what's coming down the pike? Nope. I don't think he cares either. That's refreshing. Yeah. Unless he's wrong. I've always been fascinated with the newspaper business. I used to sit in on the lectures with the Nieman fellows when I was at Harvard. I read that you were an editor once. Oh, yes. Yeah, that was a very long time ago. The Mississippi Register. Small, diocesan newspaper. But for a 30-year-old pastor, it was a big responsibility. Too much at times. How so? I was close with the Evers brothers. We took a stand on civil rights. Our readership was not pleased. They saw me as a meddling outsider. I can imagine. Tough seat to sit in, especially in a small town. I think you'll find that Boston's still a small town, too, Marty, in many ways. But if I can be of any help, Marty, don't hesitate to ask. I find that the city flourishes when its great institutions work together. Thank you. Personally I'm of the opinion that for a paper to best perform its function, it really needs to stand alone. Ah. Of course. But my offer still stands. Thank you. Come in. Ah! Thank you, Maureen. A little gift, Marty. Think of it as a Cardinal's guide to the city of Boston. I'm here to see Sacha Pfeiffer. Your name? Phil Saviano. Okay, just a minute. So am I the first survivor you've talked to? Yeah, Phil. You are. Okay, well... First of all, let me say thank you for having me in today. And I want you to know that you have the full cooperation of my organization, SNAP. How many members are in your organization, Phil? We had 11 at our last chapter meeting... Uh, no, 10. Karen just moved. You had a woman in your group? Of course there was a woman. They don't discriminate, not when it comes to abuse. And this has nothing to do with being gay. What this is, is priests using the collar to rape kids. Kids. Boys and girls. I was 11, and I was preyed upon by Father David Holley in Worcester. And I don't mean prayed for. I mean preyed upon. Are any of you Catholic? I was raised Catholic. Now I go to my wife's Presbyterian church. I'm lapsed. I go to church with my grandmother sometimes. It's safe to say we were all raised Catholic, but now... Not so much. Okay. Well, let me tell you. When you're a poor kid from a poor family, religion counts for a lot. And when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal. He asks you to collect the hymnals or take out the trash, you feel special. It's like God asking for help. So maybe it's a little weird when he tells you a dirty joke, but now you got a secret together, so you go along. Then he shows you a porno mag, and you go along. And you go along, and you go along, until one day he asks you to jerk him off or give him a blow job. And so you go along with that, too, because you feel trapped, because he has groomed you. How do you say no to God, right? See, it is important to understand that this is not just physical abuse, it's spiritual abuse, too. And when a priest does this to you, he robs you of your faith. So you reach for the bottle or the needle. Or if those don't work, you jump off a bridge. That's why we call ourselves survivors. Have you read Jason Berry's book? He wrote about the Gauthe case in Louisiana? Uh, that's "G"... G-A-U-T-H-E. Here. And talk to Richard Sipe. He worked in one of the Church's treatment centers. He's an ex-priest, married a nun. Here. This is his testimony from the Kos case. Uh, Phil, what's a treatment center? It's where they send priests when they get caught. This is all right here in the box, I sent this all to you guys five years ago. Uh, to the Globe? Who did you send it to? I don't wanna say who, but they said that they weren't interested. Uh, but Phil, we did run a couple of stories on you. I saw them in the clips. Yeah, but to be completely frank, it wasn't enough. You guys gotta understand, this is big. This is not just Boston. It's the whole country. It's the whole world. And it goes right up to the Vatican. Do you have any proof of that, Phil? No, not yet. But think about it, there are so many of them. How else could they have hidden it for so long? So many what? Priests! Priests! I know of 13 right here in Boston. You know 13 priests in Boston who have molested children? Yeah, why do you keep repeating everything I say? I just like to clarify things. Maybe you should have clarified it five years ago when I sent you all of this stuff! It's all right here! May I use your bathroom? Yeah, sure, Phil. Come on. Well, what do you think? Well, the guy, he's got an agenda, that's for sure. You think? He's obviously been through a lot. But he's smart, and if he's right about 13 priests... Yeah, it might be a big "if" with this guy. Do a background check on him, and follow up with some of the other survivors of his group. I'll track down this ex-priest, Sipe. Okay, but stay on Garabedian. That's more important. Garabedian, what a pain in the ass. You can be a pain in the ass, Mike. Mmm. Mitchell, what a surprise. How are you? I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes. Good. You know, I haven't heard back from you. I left you a couple of messages. I know. I've been very busy. I don't have time for calls. Oh, jeez, I'm sure you don't. Listen, listen, Mitch, let me talk to a couple of the victims. You could sit in on the interview, and if you're not happy, you could kill it. I spoke to my clients, and they don't want to be in the press. I'm sorry. I get that, but I don't need to name names. I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes. I'm sure you don't. I don't. Listen, Mitchell. Look, Mr. Rezendes, please... I'm not writing a profile here. I'm working on something bigger. Bigger? I don't know what that means. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I'm digging around for Spotlight. Spotlight's on this? Yeah, we're looking into it, but you gotta help me. You gotta let me talk to some of these victims, please. Please. Come back tomorrow. 9:30 a.m. Thank you. Ms. Pfeiffer? Joe? Hi. Oh, shoot. Oh, that's okay. Sorry. No, no problem. Please sit. Thank you. Is this table okay? This is perfect. I had a muffin while I was waiting. Two, actually. I eat when I'm nervous. I do that, too, actually. I hope I'm not late. Phil told me 1:00. No, you're fine. I got here early. About an hour. Um, would you mind if I took some notes? Would that be all right? You don't mind if I take some notes, do you? - Are you going to use my name? - No. Not if you don't want me to. No. I just had a kid. He's only one, but I'm not sure I want him to know about this. Sure. I get that. You can stop this interview at any time, Patrick. All right? Okay. Go ahead with your notes. Okay. So, um... Where'd you live when it first happened? In the projects, over in Hyde Park. Over by the Stop & Shop? Yeah, you know it? Yeah, I drove a cab for a few years. Open early. Bad coffee, right? Yeah, I guess. How old were you when it happened? I was 12. Just after my dad killed himself. Ah, jeez. He was a real piece of shit. And my mom, she wasn't so stable either. How do you mean? I mean, she was nuts. She was a schizophrenic. Same shit. When did you first meet Geoghan? Well, my sister, she saw him over in the Dunkin' Donuts. Tells him about my old man passing, and he rushed right over. And there was this nun, Sister Barbara, and she ran this group for kids from troubled families. Mmm-hmm. Where was that? St. Ambrose in Dorchester. Okay. She's the one who introduced me to Father Shanley. He was a street priest. Long hair. Very hip. He invited me to his apartment in Back Bay. Where in Back Bay? Beacon Street. Beacon. Okay. Are you from here? Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio, but my mom's from Southie. Okay, so you get it. I'd never even seen Back Bay. So what happened on that first visit, Joe? Well, he was very nice at first, very funny, very casual. And I think he could tell I was gay, so he showed me this mobile he had, like, over a baby's crib? Mmm-hmm. But with different words. "Homosexual, transsexual, bisexual." Okay, and did you know you were gay at that time, Joe? Yeah. But that wasn't information I was sharing with anybody. Not in Dorchester. Okay. So, what happened after he showed you the mobile? Well, I was a little freaked out. Mmm-hmm. I think he could tell, so he said, "You know what'll help is if we play strip poker." Course I lost. And, uh, things went on from there. Can you tell me specifically what happened? Specifically, he... He molested me. Joe, I think that the language is going to be so important here. We can't sanitize this. Just saying "molest" isn't enough. People need to know what actually happened. We should probably get these to go. Right. Geoghan shows up, and my mom, you know, she's... She's thrilled. I mean... This was like God showing up, you know? Sure. Right. So what happened then? You really want to hear this shit? Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do. He offers to take me to get ice cream. And, you know, he's a priest. I'm a kid, so I go. Sure. So we're driving home and he... He starts patting my leg, you know, then his hand just slides right up, and he grabs my dick. You know, I just froze up. I was fucking petrified, I couldn't move. I didn't know what to do. I was just a little kid. Yeah. You know, I never even touched my ice cream. It just melted down my arm. Did you, um... Did you see him again after that? Yeah. All right. That's good. Let's stop there for now. Sure. He said it was a way to make me more comfortable with my body.
