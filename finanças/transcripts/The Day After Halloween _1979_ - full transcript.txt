Angela! Angela! Angela, Angela! Please. No, let me go! Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go of me! Let go! Oh, let go. Miss. Photographic section and arson squad already notified, arrived 6:19 P.M. Uniformed officer Steve Barn, regarding scene, stated the death had been certified. Observations from the floor. No shoe prints revealed. A charred can of solvent clearly lying on its side with the lid off nine feet from the body. Four feet to measure. Smashed window. Garments, ashen to black. Body completely charred. Blackened, one gallon container. Film from camera. Sergeant Krale from homicide squad informed. Were taken for processing at forensics laboratory. Thank you. Glad you could make it. I hope we haven't dragged you out of bed. Sorry, Mr. Plushay. Beg yours? I said, I'm sorry Mr. Plushay. My godfather, you look like the dog's dinner. This is a hair dressing salon, not a fish cannery. Oh god, I don't know why I bother. Oh, Mrs. Stover, we weren't expecting you until... I'm running early, can you take me now? Uh, well. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until... Listen, pumpkin, I've got better things to do than sit around here all day. Maybe I should take my business elsewhere. Well, perhaps I could do you. I want Angela. Mrs. Bailey is busy with another client. Then why don't you take over the other client and that will leave Angela free to do me. No, I'm afraid that's impossible. Well? Yes, you could stand a bit of a touch up. That's for sure, but don't change the subject. Oh, I don't know, Madeline. Oh what's to lose, this? Perhaps if I just layer this bit back here a little. Angela, my hair's fine, just fine. Let's go see Linsey now. Believe me, he'll be able to put your mind at ease. How about it? I don't look anything like a model. Oh, you're an authority, are you? I'm flat chested. Oh sugar, tits went out with Jayne Mansfield. Linsey does advertising, classy stuff. But it's easy for you. You always look so, well, classy. What are you a car accident? Oh come on, Angela, let go. Grab the devil by the tail. I thought you were saving to go overseas. How much have you saved? Hm? 237 dollars. That much, eh? I can only bank whatever I can keep away from Mom, otherwise. Sweetheart, you need cash, lots of it and quickly. How much does this Linsey pay? More than 237 dollars, lash out. Well, I couldn't possibly get away today. You can if you want. I can't. Oh yes, you can. How? Mr. Pluckett? It's Plushay. Pluckett like bucket, right Mr. Pluckett? Is there some problem, Mrs. Stover? Yes, Angela would like an hour or so off work. Oh, in fact, make that the rest of the day. Perhaps she needn't return at all. Splendid. Madeline! Will you keep your voice down? She'll talk how she damn well likes, you pathetic faggot. Well, it takes one to know one doesn't it, Mrs. Stover? You only live once, Ang. You've gotta reach out and grab life by the short and curlies. Easy for you to say. Come on, stop putting yourself down. You listen to the wrong people. Your mother's always telling you you're plain. Your boss tells you you're stupid. Your boyfriend tells you you're frigid and you believe every word of it. Shove off, creep! Ugh. Well, I haven't got a boyfriend. Anymore. Good. But who'd attack her? Exactly. Does she live here? She and Linsey and Peter and Wendy. Depends on who's in town, it varies. It must get confusing. Exactly. Knock, knock. Nail polish. Ah, what colour? Uh, placenta. How about fire engine red? Yeah. I've brought a friend. Shit. What? Oh no. No, no, that's fine. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's great! Hi. Pleased to meet you. I thought you might be able to use her. She has an interesting face, don't you think? Great. Her name is Angela. I'll buy it. What sort of an ad is this? Oh, this isn't an ad. This is art. Didn't we do a deodorant commercial together? I don't think we've uh... That's all right, Mad. Mad, it's all right. I've worked with her before. Everything is all right. But... Shh. Well, is there anything coming up you can use her for? Yes, fine. Well, what exactly is it? Oh, you've heard of still life? Well, this is still death. Linsey's preparing an exhibition. Oh great, but what I meant was what exactly is coming up? Oh, a job, of course. Isn't it? Right. What'd I tell you. Wait a minute, though, what job? Who cares? The great Linsey wants you, sugar. Right? Hm? Right? Pardon? You do want to use Angela as a model for an ad? Ah, yes, great! Great! Oh Linsey, the poor girl is going to think you're mad. Mm-hm! Everything's gonna be all right, Maddy. Everything is gonna be all right, absolutely perfect. Thank you. But I think I'd better tell you, I've never done an ad before in my life. In fact, I'm not even a model, I'm a hairdresser. Good, good. I'll pick you up at 8:30 tomorrow morning. Uh. 9:00? It doesn't matter. No, but what's the ad for? Cologne. Uh, I'll pick you up at nine o'clock then. What's your address? Oh, I live with my mom. I think I'd better meet you here. All right meet you here and then I'll drive you down in the car. Down where? To the beach. We're gonna shoot an ad on the beach? In the middle of winter? Well, that's advertising, sugar. Winter campaigns are shot in summer and summer campaigns are shot in winter. Well, what do I wear? Definitely not! What's wrong with it? If there's nothing wrong with it, why didn't he tell me? Linsey? It probably didn't occur to him. Oh, sure. Angela, Linsey's probably the top advertising photographer in this country and he wants to do you. Who cares what you wear? I care! My mother will certainly care. And it's what I won't be wearing that bothers me. You're being ridiculous, Linsey's a professional. Madeline, the man takes photos of dead mice. Think of the opportunity. Definitely not. Then think of the money. No way! How much? One. 100 dollars for one day's work? Dear, sweet Angela. One thousand dollars for one half day's work. You're kidding. Double rates for nude work, Ang. I'll think about it. Drive, drive! What? Just drive. Boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. Mr. Whippy? It's a long story. Why don't you want to see him? Because he just won't leave me alone. He'll wanna talk then he'll end up crying and pleading and telling me he loves me. He's sick. He's also following us. Do you want me to lose him? Can you? What did he want? He said he's gonna knock the shit outta you. Becky! Though, I wouldn't blame him if he did the way you treat him. What would you know? I like him. He's the best boyfriend you've ever had. Mom thinks so, too. He's a creep. He wants me to tell Mom to make you ring him. Don't you dare. Well, why shouldn't I? You think you're such hot stuff. Where'd you go today when you shoulda been at the salon? To see about a job. And if you breathe a word to Mom, I'll tell her you smoke. Who'd hire you? You'd be surprised, little sister. Yeah that's it. Come on, let's go. Good morning. Good morning. Madeline, this is ridiculous. Linsey knows what he's doing. He can't fly the whole crew to Bermuda, can he? Don't worry. Easy for you to say. We all had to start somewhere, sugar. I shoulda been at work two hours ago. Oh god, what if my mom finds out? Are you sure Linsey isn't gonna shoot my face? Believe me, no one's gonna recognise your face. Well why should I trust a man who photographs dead mice? Ang! Break a leg, Ang. What am I doing? Do what I do, sweetie.

Are you into modelling full-time? Actually, I'm just a hairdresser. Aw, well. Are you still a solicitor? I prize myself. Deliveries. Well. Let's fly, Angela. Your mother will be frantic. You're not wrong. How are you getting home? What's it to you, phallus-face? I was talking to Angela. I was watching. You had your hand up her dress. I was offering her a job. Stick your job up your butt, Jack. Take it easy, George. It's Roger. Do you like women touching you, John? Huh? Do you like pretty women putting their hand there, huh? ♪ And they called him ♪ ♪ Big balls that have dough ♪ But he was just offering me a job. But why? What's in it for him? And what does he want from you? Ask yourself that. Don't be silly. Thanks. Do I look drunk or anything? No. I'm really sorry about your car, Mad. Like I said, sugar, you've got to be careful. The world's full of strange people. Well. Well. What are you doing here? To see you. I'm locked out. Your mom's disappointed in you, Angie. She's bolted the door. Try and see it from her point of view. You've been talking to her, haven't you? Daryl. Why can't you just let go? You're my girl, Angie. I love you. Where are you gonna go? She won't let you in. Don't go, please don't go. Just. Don't go. What lady? You know what lady. Right. Aye. Hm? Just a friend, Daryl. Must be a pretty good friend, eh? Your mom reckons... Oh look, why don't you fall in love with my mother? You seem to hit it off so well. That's sick. You and Mom and little Miss Goody-Goody. Oh, so now it's Becky's fault too, is it? Everybody's to blame except Angela. My god, you've changed. Good. Fine. You turning queer or something, is that it? It would explain a few things. Daryl. Angela, I saw you kissing her. Who? That lady. You're crazy. I saw you, Angie. Well, I suppose there's no use hiding any longer. I must be going queer. Oh. Angela. Why do you keep bugging me? Everybody keeps bugging me. We were lovers. We had two screws, love had nothing to do with it. You coulda fooled me. That's right, Daryl. Why are you trying so hard to hurt me? Hurt your Mom? Anybody who tries to get close to you. I suppose I'm just dirt. An ungrateful, inconsiderate, teenage dyke. I'd like to get out here, please. Four years we've been going together. Angie, I was part of the family. Look, would you mind stopping so I could get out? You ever heard of guppies, Angela? Guppies are little fish. We had some once, in a tank. And if you put your hand up against the glass, real quick, a mother guppy will eat her babies. What's that supposed to mean? Hello? Knock, knock. You wanna see something great? Yeah. Listen, I'm really sorry to turn up here at four o'clock in the morning. Yeah, fine. I knew this was great, but this is something else, this is beyond words. You see the thing is, my mother's locked me out and I was wondering if... Don't cheat. Anyway, I was wondering if I might be able to. If I might be able to crash here for the night? Yes, yes, yes, yes! Got you, my young animal. Ready! Ta-dum! Huh? What exactly is it? It's Bermuda Cool lurching out of the sea, stripped in montage, technical stuff. Well, it's very... Words fail me. I'm off to my bed. You want to crash here tonight? Boom, boom. I'll clean it up properly for you tomorrow. Oh, it's just for tonight, really. I've got to be at work in four hours. Well, you can stay as long as you like. It's very casual here. The chap who usually lives here is in Bali. Oh, thanks. Thanks. Right. It's been quite a day. Goodnight. Linsey? Why do you take photos of dead things? Are you really interested? Well, I suppose primarily because no one else does. Well, I suppose primarily because no one else does. The entire spectrum of dead fauna is mine. I think I'm the only bloke in the world who is totally into lifeless wildlife. They stay where they're put and they're very cheap. I don't know when to take you seriously. It's a very serious matter, death. Yeah. Nice to talk to somebody who's interested. Goodnight. Goodnight. Well, you've gotta learn to look after yourself, Ang. Yeah, well I'm still pretty marketable at the moment, aren't I? I suppose I have to get a job eventually. No, I mean actually look after yourself. You know, pow, pst, bang. A friend of mine got on a train one night, was raped between stations. 33 seconds, I timed it. It was 33 seconds. Oh god, whatever happened to foreplay? You see the trick is to get a good, clean shot at the throat. A lot of people tell you the crotch. But I think a good, clean king hit right up the throat does more permanent damage. Anyway, you can always do the balls later once you've stunned the bastard. Great. Oh god. It's not bad, Linsey. Shit. What? Oh shit, Linsey. What's the matter, Ang? It's terrific! You can see my face, look! Linsey, you promised. Look at that, plain as day. Jesus, Linsey. You said you wouldn't show my face. Who's gonna recognise this? My mother will. Nobody will know it's you unless you tell them. I could change my hair. Wear sunglasses or something. Don't like it then? Oh, no, it's beautiful, Linsey. I'm sorry, Lilly's right. Can I have this one? Yeah, sure. Now before you get distracted, it's been a week. You think you could feed the kitty? You know, for food, rent, everything else? Oh yeah, fine. How much? Well if you can afford it, the ones with money usually try and carry the ones that aren't so flush.

But Madeline told me how uneasy you were with that photo and I saw you sitting there and I just couldn't resist it. Forgive me? Of course, Mr. Stover, I. Elmer. Elmer, Mad's told me a lot about you. Likewise. Elmer, give me your honest opinion, can you really recognise me in that photo? Hm, well it's hard to tell with your clothes on. Oh good lord, Angela. Most models would sell their soul to the devil for that sort of recognition. That's the name of the game isn't, Mad? No seriously, honey. Most beautiful young women that I know literally throw themselves in front of my cameras. Like lemmings dashing into the North Sea. Yeah, I suppose it's silly worrying about one, stupid photo in one magazine. Ah, ha. Whatever it may be, it is not a stupid photo. It's a dream. It's gonna sell a lot of cologne. You must be in very great demand. Oh yes, the phone simply hasn't stopped ringing. Paris, London, Alaska. And a sense of humour. Look, when the demographics of this campaign get back to the agencies, you're gonna be hot stuff. Hey, what are you doing Saturday? Well, we've got a few friends coming over for drinks. Maybe even a barbecue, weather permitting. Say any time after 4:30? Why not? It's a date. Now you see them, now you don't. That should keep the censors happy. Angela. Oh, sorry. So this is Angela? This is Mr. Boris Spears from the agency. How do you do? Mr. Harold Scutter and Mr. Ron Brown from the Bermuda Cool Company. Oh yes, we met on the beach. This is the billboard format, Angela. I'm gonna be on a billboard? More like 400 billboards. Uh, by the way, Ang. A package came for you this afternoon. A package? Yes, it's in the kitchen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen? If we could just come back down here. She's just leaving. Give it five minutes, okay. What's that about five minutes? Nothing. What's going on down there? Mom, what do you want? Your sister was involved in an accident. What? The doctor said she was very lucky. She'll have her leg in plaster for awhile, that's all but it'll be a financial strain and I thought, as you've got this wonderful new job, I thought perhaps I could depend on you to pay back a little money, that's all. Pay back? No, no. It doesn't matter. Becky and I don't need that sort of money. What do you mean that sort? What exactly do you do? I told you, I'm learning advertising. From the boy downstairs? Yes. Who conducts meetings at 11:30 P.M. Yes. And who pays you a little, or well enough. Was that what you said? Enough to live in somebody's attic, right? What are you getting at? No, no, just let me get my facts straight. I wouldn't want to have misrepresent my little angel like Becky and Daryl have obviously done. Mom, what are you talking about? I am talking about the 900 dollars in that drawer! You went through my dresser? Well, I was looking for a pencil and paper, that's all. After three hours of waiting for you to come back from god knows where, I thought I'd leave you a note. That's a lie! You could have left a message downstairs. What else have you been lying about? Becky's accident? You ring Northern General Hospital and ask about that girl lying on her back in casualty ward. Then we'll see who the liar is. How dare you! How long did you have to lie on your back to earn more money than I get in three months? Right. Well, I'll show you then. Since we're being so honest with each other. That's what the little angel had to do. There, that's Angela, Mom. Ugly, awkward, stupid Angela. Well, now I'm sure I did the right thing. I think there is some justice in life I could almost laugh. And it's all been made possible by you. Or should I say, that. Now remember, my angel, when things start to go sour, don't darken my doorway ever. I'm surprised that Madeline didn't ring you. Well, I'm not exactly on the phone. The party's off, is it? She had this job that came up at the last minute. Oh damn, I am sorry. Well, it's a little bit awkward. I came by cab. Well look, I've got a roast in the oven. I insist you stay and help me eat it. Oh no, really, I couldn't. Nonsense, you're just being polite, I insist. Now, Bacardi and coke, wasn't it? What was the job? Beg yours? Madeline's job. Oh, Kitty Cakes. Pardon? ♪ Feed your puss on Kitty Cakes ♪ ♪ Buy them now, for pussy's sake ♪ ♪ Made from fish and liver too ♪ ♪ Kitty Cakes will make them spew a mew ♪ Oh you're kidding! Poor Madeline. And what are you working on at the moment? Oh, just a little co production deal with Paramount. But let's not talk shop. Tell me about you. Well, there's not really much to tell. Nonsense, tell me about your friends, where you live, what your ambitions are. I want to know everything about you. Something to do with demographics, I don't know. All I know is I'm broke and the rent's due. I'm thinking of trying to get my old job back at the salon. Oh, what absolute twaddle. A girl like you shouldn't have to concern herself with things like rent. Well. Madeline never mentioned anything about this to me. I had no idea you were available. Am I ever available. Well, I tell you what you do. First thing on Monday you grab a cab, my account. You come to my office and you ask for this man. Mark Free. He's in casting. You're joking. I never joke about film. Now, Mark will probably want to run a few tests and of course it's gonna approved by David Blake in Los Angeles, but after that, who knows? Well, that's great! That's fantastic! Well, I wish I'd known about it before. Look, I don't know anything about acting. Did Monroe? Did Grable? Did anybody before they gave it a try? Look, you let me be the judge of that. I don't know what to say. Well, say yes. Well, yes. Great, now we can celebrate. Is champagne okay? Anything. I'll be right back. Oh, damn. Hello? Oh, Madeline. Yeah? Oh no! Hey listen, Angela's here. Yeah, but you said you'd ring her. Yeah? Yeah okay, baby. Yeah, bye. That was Madeline. She's been held up at the studio. She says they're going to be there to all hours. So, she suggests you stay the night and she'll run you home first thing in the morning. Oh, well I. She's up to here in Kitty Cakes. And she says that all she'll want to do is to crawl into a hot bath. Well, yes, if it's no inconvenience. Excellent. Now we can get down to serious matters. Hi. Is Angela at home? What's wrong? Oh, just a wild, random thought. What? Well I was thinking, if I get some still shots off by special courier, we could have Paramount's answer by Monday. Well, what would that entail? Mm. I suppose if it came right down to it, I could take a few shots myself. What, you mean here? Ah, it's a crazy idea. Well, what do you want me to do? I think it's right there. Just move up towards the end of the banner bit. Mm-hm, muss up the hair a smidgen. Let's pretend you're somebody's mistress. Don't you need lights and things? Flash. And perhaps the dress off the shoulder. Undo the top button, hm? νery Sophia Loren. Like that? Beautiful, now as you were. And again. And. Lovely. Is that all? Very professional. Now I think a couple sans chemisette. Huh? Sans chemisette, it's French. It means without the blouse, literally. Oh, I'm sorry. I spend so much time working with really experienced models, um. Now how do we get out of this? Ah. Yes, that's very nice. Just hold it there. And now perhaps one with the arm down a little. Just a hint more breast. That's beautiful. Now smile. And now I think one or two just a bit brassier. The hands on the hips, like that? Is Madeline really coming home tonight? What's wrong, Angela? Is she? What on earth are you insinuating? Thank you for a lovely evening. But you're not going, surely? It was a beautiful dinner. It's a pity you have to leave so soon. Yes. Please tell Madeline I'm sorry to have missed her. Goodnight. But. How are you going to? - Ah! - Oh! Ha, you gave me a fright. I'm just going out. Listen, there's somebody asleep up in my room. So? Well, I just wish Peter's mates would find somewhere else to crash. It isn't any of Peter's mates. Well then... I've gotta fly. But Wendy! Oh, by the way, some guy came around looking for you tonight. Who? Just some guy. Well, what'd he want? He had a bag of stuff your mom sent. Was his name Daryl? Drives an ice cream truck. Oh Jesus, I don't know. I'm not the bloody receptionist around here. He was just a nice, average guy and he just wanted to drop this bag off. And you let him go up to my room? Look, I'm getting a little sick of this my room, your room crap. It wasn't like that before you came. But did you see him leave? Wendy! Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. So you want to bring the police in? What do you think the police are going to do? Daryl's sick! He and half a million other people in town. Sugar, Linsey would freak if you brought the cops in. Anyway, what are they going to do? They're going to say you're inviting trouble living in a place like that. And then they'll say, sorry, pumpkin, but we've got more important things to worry about then hassle some nut who puts pigs heads in people's beds. And you know what, Ang, they'd be right. Well, what am I gonna do, I'm broke. Go home. No. Look, why don't you let me put you up for awhile? Were you working last night? Who told you that? Elmer, there was supposed to be a barbecue, remember? Oh no, don't tell me. He told you I'd forgotten to ring, right? Yes. Invited you in for a drink and told you about a ridiculous movie deal? That's right. What am I going to do with that child? I have to watch him every minute. By god, sugar, you didn't buy it? Well, at first, I don't know. We had dinner and then... He made dinner? That's a new one. He's done this before? Yeah, oh well, let me explain about Elmer. All he would have wanted to do is take a little peak at your titties. That's all that would have happened, right. More or less. Bastard. Oh look, I'm awfully sorry, Ang. I suppose I should have warned you, but believe me, if you'd have made the slightest sexual advance toward Elmer he would have run for his life. Well. No harm done, I suppose. Somehow this isn't working out quite how I planned. What isn't? Life. Beats the hell out of death. All I want to do was get away. Lots of girls go overseas. I mean, I'm not so different, am I? No. Naive? Stupid? No more than the rest of us. Pretty, I must be pretty. Mm, you're adorable. Good body? Fantastic body. I mean, I'm practically famous. Damn right. The Bermuda Cool girl. Right on. Then what am I doing here? Same as me, sugar. Sitting here like a hooker waiting for a million dollar trick. Two French sows rooting for the ultimate truffle. Let's get out of here. I'm a bit nervous about going back to Linsey's. I'll keep you company. Would you? What are friends for? Shh. Wah! Shh! You'll wake everybody up. You'll wake everybody up! Shh. In a Mr. Whippy van? Oh god. God, you're worse than Elmer. Mr. Whippy, caught with pants down. And get your battery powered popsicles. God honey, how does a 16 year old virgin get mixed up with a 30 year old ice cream freak? Well for a start, he wasn't 30 then. He was only 27. Oh well. Your mother condoned this debauchery? What debauchery? Listen, a date with Daryl consisted of him coming over for dinner and buttering Mom up for five hours, falling asleep in front of the television, then I'd walk him out to the van, he'd stick his tongue in my mouth and nighty-night. Ugh. Mom thought he was Christmas. I mean it was more or less taken for granted that I'd someday become Mrs. Whippy. Well, it sounds to me as if he still hasn't got the message, hun. Exactly. Why do you think I want to go overseas? Wasn't a very good introduction to sex, was it? Awful. And you think running away overseas to god knows where is going to help? Yup! Ever consider the problem might be in your head? My head? I haven't got a problem. No? No. Nearly 20 years old and only two quickies under your belt. I had a very strict upbringing. So did I, but I was banging like a bunny before I was out of my first training bra. Trouble is, it wasn't until I was your age that I discovered that I was banging the wrong gong. Banging the wrong gong? I've never heard that one before. Haven't you? What's it mean? You don't know? No. Are you sure? Yeah. You can't even guess? Madeline. My dear, sweet, innocent Angela. Madeline, what are you doing? Do you think? Oh gosh, anyone would think we were a couple of old dykes. Yup, well, I've got a long drive home. Well, I'll walk you down. Oh, don't bother. Well, thanks for driving me home and everything. Yeah, see you. She'll have to wait. Why me? Mr. Eliot apparently ran into you on the dance floor. He liked your head and suggested you to the agency. Agency? Our clients. They, in turn, looked at your Bermuda Cool ad and want to use you. You are available? Uh, yes. Immediately? How immediate? You'll be catching a flight to Fiji tomorrow evening. Fiji! Oh, you don't have to worry about passports and so forth. We look after all that. You see, they're in the middle of shooting their campaign and they need a replacement immediately. You could be there up to a month or so. Who's this we you're referring to? Our clients. Oh, I see. The standard deal is 1500 a week and expenses. Is that suitable? Yes. Good. Then we can count on you? I'm thinking of leaving. Cut! Good, Brian. Just two things. Pausing. Now the thing about pausing is we have to see you... Hi. We're still friends. Well, I hope so. But I've come to say goodbye. I finally got the chance to get away. I'm gonna take it and run. Well, tell me about it. My solicitor friend has business overseas. He needs an assistant. An assistant what, sugar? It's a chance to get out. As long as you know the stakes. What's his name? I asked no questions. When are you leaving? Tonight. Tonight? Are you sure you're not trading in the small hassles for big hassles? I've got to make my own mistakes, Mad. And I want to make them in Fiji. Well, good luck to you. You deserve it. And if you're ever in a pinch, you know you can count on me. Thanks. What about mama mia? I'll send her a postcard. Dear mom, drop dead. Mr. Whippy? Maybe get up enough courage to blow his brains out. He'd blow your brains out if he knew what you were up to. Yeah well, lucky for me he doesn't know. Well, I've got some packing to do. Goodbye, Mad. Take care, Ang. Anybody home? Angela! Roger Eliot Enterprises. Mr. Eliot's office is temporarily unattended. If you wish to leave a message please do so when the tone sounds. Elmer Stover. Well, what's wrong? Well, where is he now? And what about the police? Now look, Angela, hold it. You just stay where you are and I'll get a taxi right to you. You can come straight here. Okay. Now keep calm. But if he comes anywhere near you, scream your lungs out. Elmer! Anybody here? Elmer? What are you gonna do? Take your photograph. Properly this time. Then can I go? The blouse. Blouse. Now. And the rest. The rest. You know, I've always held the opinion that most people, when faced with the inevitable, will do almost anything to stay alive for just one more minute. The rest. Now. Angela! No, no. Angela! Ah! Ah, ah! Angela! Daryl! Angela! I'm stuck! Please help me! Help me, please, help me! Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela! No, let me go! Get off of me! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go of me! Let go, no! Oh, let go. Miss. Where? Just overseas. Angie, wait a minute. I can't wait, Daryl. I've gotta get to the airport. Hey! What are you doing? Angie, listen to me. A man has been killed. Let me go! But you just can't walk away. I can! I can! Let me go, Daryl, I've gotta hurry. I'm afraid I can't let you do that. Can't let me? Who do you think you are, my father? I don't take orders from you. I don't even like you. Well no, please, wait. I can't wait. Now just go. What's got into you? What's got into me? Me? You go around putting pigs heads in people's beds. And you wanna know what's got into me? Pigs heads? Angie look, I admit I've done some pretty crazy things but I don't know anything about. Better hurry if we're going to catch our plane. You.
