The Red Head. Ah, here's Monsieur Lepic! How are you, M Lepic? Honorine! Why are you being familiar with M Lepic? Oh, Mme Lepic knows that it doesn't bother him. Maybe. But you must respect his position. A servant is a servant. Going out, dear? It's so warm, you won't need a jacket. Hey, the children are returning today. Don't forget to pick them up at the station. And tell the farmer to get the cart ready, for the trunks. Quite right. A straw hat is best in this heat. It's like talking to a stone! Not one word! Not even, "You bore me." Twenty years of this! - Family! - A family... is a group of people forced to live together under one roof, and who can't stand each other. Did you write that? Fran?ois Lepic, did you? Now look, it's the holidays. You're going back home to your family for two months. I need to know what you mean by this. It suggests a strange state of mind. Is this how you thank your parents for their sacrifices? You father provides for you, doesn't he? - Yes, M Lepic... - What's that? "M Lepic"? Yes, M Lepic... I mean, my father... - Well? Your father? - He's very impressive. I don't see him much. He's always working in Paris, or he's out hunting. And at home he never speaks. He sniggers into his beard, especially when my brother F?lix is being funny. But... he loves you? Oh, I suppose so. In his own way... silently. - And your mother? - Madame Lepic? Oh, she talks and talks. She argues all on her own. The more M Lepic keeps quiet, the more she talks. She talks to M Lepic, who says nothing, to my brother F?lix, who replies when it suits him, and to me, and I reply when it suits her. And she talks to the dog, who wags its tail. Come along, old Minus, we'll take a little walk. And then we'll go and fetch the children from the station. There are marks on the dishes, Honorine. Marks? How could they have got marks in the cupboard? Maybe something has been walking around on them. Look at these spots. Where? - I don't see anything. - I didn't think so. Listen, I'm not saying I'm letting you go, but you're getting old... And, in spite of the cost, I'm willing to hire someone to help you. I'd never get along with another woman in my way. Exactly as I thought. So... I've hired a young girl. - So I'm being thrown out. - No, my dear Honorine. There'll always be a bowl of soup for you here. You've got old, you poor thing. Your eyesight's going. You need rest. It's a young girl I hired last week. So, if she comes while I'm out... Excuse me, sir. Which way to the Lepics' house? The Lepics? What do you want there? I'm Annette Perrault. Mme Lepic hired me last week as a maid. - Straight on and first left. - Thank you. Just a moment... Since you're going to the Lepics... You must act from your heart, be affectionate. When you see your father, throw your arms round him. Throw my arms round M Lepic? - Why not? He's not a bell tower. - I'd rather jump in the river. What a strange little fellow! Why do you say that? If I threw my arms round M Lepic, he'd think I was going to bite him. And he'd push me off and say, "Carrot-top, get off my feet!" - He calls you "Carrot-top"? - Of course! Mme Lepic gave me that name because of the colour of my hair. - Your hair is blonde. - It's red to Mme Lepic. - She has sharp eyes. - Run along. You'll miss the train. - F?lix will be looking for you. - Goodbye! Goodbye. And be kind to your mother. It's so good to have a nice mother. She has her own particular way of showing hatred. A very nasty way. One moment you'll be her little Fifi, the next she'll be looking for reasons to complain. But you'll soon get to know her character. As for M Lepic, I know him well. He hates three things: lies, disorder and gossip. There! Hey, shepherd... You'll be elected for sure, this time. And we'll finally have a mayor worthy of the village. Madame Lepic? You know, Mme Lepic would like to go to heaven on her own, without me. She's a sanctimonious old egoist. She wants me to roast in hell. That's fine by me. At least I won't be joining her in paradise. Goodbye. I'm off to the station to pick up the children. There are three of them: Carrot-top, F?lix and Ernestine. The youngest is Carrot-top. Carrot-top? That's a strange name. The name suits him well. Madame Lepic says so. I'll clear the table. Yes, he's a funny kid. Mme Lepic swears he's a lying, hypocritical, good-for-nothing layabout. That's what she says. All that at the same time? Oh, I never noticed it myself. But it must be true if Mme Lepic says so. - Where's the kitchen? - Here. But, in my opinion, the kid came too late. They weren't expecting another and, well, you understand... But he's not such a bad little kid. He can give you a hand now and then. No thanks. I can manage fine on my own. Why not? He'd rather be working than playing. That's child number two. Ernestine. She's no worse than any other kid. Only... you never know what she's thinking. That's the eldest. F?lix. Madame Lepic's darling. If you ask me, she's scared of him. Only, she says he has a delicate nature. Hey, F?lix! Everyone aboard! - Hello, father. - Hello. - Goodbye! - Ah, Minus! I'm so happy to see you, my little Minus! Hey, watch out! You're on my feet, Carrot-top. Come on... Let's go! F?lix, my big boy, a slice of melon? I don't like melon. And you don't either, do you, Carrot-top? - Don't you answer when I speak to you? - Yes, Mum. Don't talk with your mouth full! Disgusting little boy! Are you going to leave that there? Would you pass me a little bread to go with my jam? Oh! Mme Lepic is speaking to M Lepic. There's going to be trouble! To be insulted in front of my own children! And in front of the servants. Oh! Madame shouldn't get so upset. What? Mind your own business! Back to work! Have you at least shut up the chicken coop? No, Madame. I forgot. All right. Carry on with your work. You're so lucky! I've done harder things than that. You'd see. Crossing the yard, at night, without a light... I'd manage. F?lix, my boy. Would you shut the chicken coop? Oh, I don't have time. I'm reading. Carrot-top! Go and shut the chicken coop. My little Carrot-top. Oh, it's too dark! He won't go. He's too frightened to do it. - I'll go, Madame. - No, you won't. You're scared, aren't you, Carrot-top? Me? Scared? And give the melon rind to the rabbits. - Scared, weren't you? - Me? Huh! That's what you think. In that case, Carrot-top, you can do it every night. - Good night, my dear. - Good night, Mum. Good night. Good night. - Does anyone need the toilet? - No. No. Bye! And also, Lord, if you're a decent chap, please fix it so my mother forgets me tomorrow. Thy will be done. There! I've fed the dog, the chickens and the rabbits. When F?lix has had his hot chocolate, the whole Lepic family will be fed and watered. Now let's hang this up in the meadow. Let me take it, Monsieur Lepic. Call me Carrot-top, and I'll call you Annette. Yes, Monsieur Lepic. - Carrot-top! - Yes, Monsieur Carrot-top. Not "Monsieur"! Mme Lepic would go mad if she heard that! Leave it. It's too heavy for you. That's what you say! Feel that! Go on! Why are you looking at me like that? Listen. We need to understand each other, so that we can work together. Who wants to go hunting with me? Oh! Daddy! Me, me! It's my turn! All right. We'll leave in five minutes. - Leave it! - No, no. - You like hunting, do you? - Oh yes, it's great! I get to carry the bag, and I scare out the hares. - So, do you like it here? - Maybe. It's no worse here than anywhere else. And with Mme Lepic, she'll be fine for a month, while she puts up with you. In the meantime, here's a good tip: To get on her good side, just say bad things about me. She doesn't like you much, does she? She's my mother. She's certainly the mother of F?lix. She dotes on him. F?lix and I have nothing in common. - Going out, dear? - Yes. I'm cycling into the village with my kite. I'm coming too, right? I'll sit on the handlebars. Certainly. Isn't that right, dear? Oh, I don't care. Darling! Do you get many visitors? No. M Lepic doesn't like company. He's rude to Mme Lepic's friends, so they don't come back. I'd better hurry. M Lepic might leave without me. Annette! What do you think you're doing? Nothing, Madame. I was talking with your son. Aha! You were talking with my son, Carrot-top. - He's a good little man. - He's certainly won you over. You're lucky to be in the good favours of Carrot-top. Not everyone is so fortunate. Take your hands out of your pockets, or I'll sew them shut. Look at the little scruff! What's got into you? You'd think I was maltreating you. Dirty boy. If there was one splash of mud left in the world, it would end up on you. I was digging. You've finally managed to ruin your smock. Go to the farm and fetch me some cream. - Do you hear me? - Yes, Mum. - Is your trunk still at the station? - Yes, Madame. You can pick it up in the wheelbarrow. Right? Don't you answer when you're spoken to? - It's just... - What? - I'm going hunting with Daddy. - You are NOT going hunting. - I promised. - Then you'll break your promise. - What am I going to say? - Tell him you changed your mind. - You're sulking. - No. Yes, you are sulking, you wooden head! Now, I forbid you to go hunting with your father. - Love you. - Goodbye! If I had only those two... Let's go... Hey, are you coming? No. I've thought about it. I'd rather stay here. - Are you making fun of me? - No. I just changed my mind. What are you doing? I'm going to tell him that it was Mme Lepic who stopped you going. - What's it got to do with you? - He'll think you're moody. Oh, he's used to it. All I want is to avoid getting hit. M Lepic never hits me, but Mme Lepic, for the slightest reason... slap! - Look out, she's watching. - Where? Behind the window. So what? We're not doing anything wrong. You don't know her! - She won't eat us. - She might... Oh la la! My God. - Is this how you spend your holidays? - Yes. Next Sunday, I'm going to see my godfather. He's great! I have to go to the farm. Hey, you little duck! Is the water good? Yes, Godfather. It's warm! How can I catch anything with you splashing about? It's OK, I've finished swimming now. Here... Dry yourself. You're cold. Here, have a drop of this. It's good. It gets the blood going. - Ugh! Revolting. - A worm isn't dirty. You won't find anything cleaner in the world. All it eats is earth. - I eat them. - Go on. Show me. These ones are a bit big. I'd have to grill them and spread them on some bread. I prefer the little ones, like you get in plums. That's why the family says you're disgusting. - I don't give a damn. - Hello, Carrot-top! Oh great, it's Mathilde! Get dressed first! You can't go round naked in front of the ladies. Oh, she's my fianc?e. That's no reason to show your goods before the wedding. - You OK? - Yes. Is it today we're getting married? No, I'm not dressed for it. - But we can have a rehearsal. - Yes, yes. I still need another 50 francs to get a free-wheel for my bike. I know where to get some money. In the chest of drawers. Under the pile of linen. What? Mum's money? We can't have a marriage without music, Carrot-top. Hang on. I'll get my hurdy-gurdy and play you a little serenade. Since we're getting married, I can give you a kiss. Hey, that's funny. When I do that it goes all red. Today is the wedding day of one of our kin. Churchwarden, ring your bells! Play, my bagpipes! The girl isn't rich but she's charming and pretty, which is enough for the handsome groom. Oh, maids of the village and all around, put on your best finery. Run! The royal cort?ge is passing through the streets. Sing out with joy! And now the wedding feast. Sit down. - Are you hungry? - Oh yes, yes. - Here. Would you like some? - No, thank you. It's good to see you wolfing it down like that. It seems your mother doesn't give you as much as you'd like. It depends. If she's hungry, I can eat till she's finished. She'll serve me well enough, but when she's finished, I'm finished too! You have to speak up for yourself! - That's easy to say! - You're scared of her? The trouble is I don't scare her enough. For example, when she tries to give my brother F?lix a slap, he jumps up like a ballet dancer and scares the life out of her. Do like him. Try some ballet. That would be a sight, dancing a duet for my mother! It would be so charming, dancing arm in arm... We might manage to entertain her before she thrashed me. Come on, Carrot-top. We have to go back home. Damn! - Hello. - Hello, Annette. Hello, Mathilde. Get a move on, Carrot-top. - Goodbye, Carrot-top. - Goodbye, Godfather. Goodbye. You shouldn't sulk so much at home. No-one will ever love me like that! - Nobody loves me! - Stop! Nobody loves me! Hey, what's that for? There he is, the dirty brat. Dirty brat? Dirty brat? That's my son you're calling a dirty brat. I don't care if he is your son. He's a lout! A lout? Lout? Say that again! Gladly. A lout! Come along, my dear. Come on, my little Carrot-top. - We'll leave this wretch. - Wretch yourself! Old trout! My darling. Now it's just us two. Tell me, my dear, whom do you like better? Your father or your mother? I like Mum better. Dad... Not everyone is lucky enough to be an orphan. Good night. Does anyone need to go to the toilet? - No. - No. So I'll leave the light on? Good night. Annette! Lock the doors. Monsieur Lepic... Well? What is it? I wanted to tell you... The other day, it was Mme Lepic who stopped your son from going hunting. - Well? - Mme Lepic is unfair to him. - Your son is unhappy. - Who? - F?lix? - No. Carrot-top. - What? She stopped him going hunting? - Yes. - Why? - Because she knows he likes it. - Maybe she needed him. - She always needs him. He does all the chores while the others have fun, playing hopscotch or flying their kite. - I can't say I'd noticed. - Of course not, you're busy. But ever since I came here, I've seen... - Seen what? - Things. He's such a nice little boy. - Who? - Carrot-top! So intelligent. But Mme Lepic terrorizes him. If he stands up to her... Slap! It's finished. She's highly strung. So far, he can just shrug it off. But he's growing. He's not a little kid any more. Did you see his eyes today? Little problems. The usual childhood woes. There are children so unhappy they kill themselves. Have you gone mad, Annette? Go to bed. Where is the photo of Carrot-top? What photo? I've never seen one. It's true. Carrot-top! It's you? What do you want? Let me sleep! Carrot-top! This can't go on. Mme Lepic is making your life unbearable. You have to run away. It may well get to that. But where would I go? It doesn't matter. Ask to stay at school during the holidays. Only poor kids can do that. M Lepic would never agree. Ask him. Explain it to him. Do you think it's possible to confide in him? No-one loves you. - Maybe he hides his feelings. - He hides them well! Nobody loves you. So what am I to do? - There's the well in the yard. - Yes, it's deep. Throw yourself down. - I already thought of it. - There you are... But I don't like water. On the way to Godfather's house, there's the pond. You've heard the toads there as you pass by at night. - I stopped there once. - You wanted to jump in? But I can't, it's too cold. You could draw a bucket from the well and stick your head in it. That would be easier. All it needs is a minute of courage, and then it's all over. Mme Lepic will be furious. In her heart, she'll be happy. I don't want her to be happy! She's too wicked. So go on strike. Refuse to obey her. That'll make things even worse. - Try it anyway. - You think I should? I saw you. You took the money. - I'll tell Mum. - What's it got to do with you? Give me some money. - I don't have it. - Then I'll tell Dad. - OK. You'll keep my secret? - Yes. All right. Oh, let me go! So, if I was elected... It's a foregone conclusion, Mr Mayor. ...the first order of my administration would be to re-establish the mayor's right to kiss all the young brides. Oh, what a joker you are! He's not joking! Hello, M Chatelain, hello, hello. My dear little Carrot-top, would you be nice and fetch me some flour from the mill? Look, look. No, Mum! You must have misunderstood me, Carrot-top. - I asked you... - No, Mum! I won't go to the mill. Yes, in my opinion... What did you say? Are you dreaming? - No, Mum. - Look, Carrot-top... I'm asking you... I'm ordering you... to go immediately to the mill and fetch the flour. I heard you. I won't go. So I must be dreaming. You refuse to obey me? - Yes, Mum. - You refuse to obey your mother? My mother. Yes, Mum. This is mutiny. You all heard, gentlemen. I politely asked Carrot-top to do me a favour, to walk to the mill. And... you heard him. Fortunately. Because I've been accused of making things up. He shan't go! Stay there. F?lix! It's your turn to help your mother. Go and fetch a pound of flour from the mill. - Until Sunday, gentlemen. - Until Sunday. This is the respect I get from my children! I'm treated like the lowest of the low. Mummy... Get away! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See you Sunday. You see, old Minus? It was pointless. No-one loves you, Carrot-top. Look! There's water in the bucket. It'll just take one minute. One minute of courage. Do it! Go on, my dear, you go to the mill. Dirty brat! Always finding new ways to make a mess. Get to work. Make yourself useful and clean the yard. What have I done to deserve a child like this? Leave me alone, you idiot. What were you up to just now, with your head in the bucket? Hello, M Bernard. You're the first. The election is at 10? Yes, but there's M Merleron. He's late. At 10:30, his son will be getting married. That's right. He couldn't stand the old mayor. He'd rather wait for M Lepic to be elected. - M Lepic is sure to win. - Oh, it's certain. - How many votes? - 12. Lepic's a good man. But his shoes must be pinching today. This time, there's no question. Someone has stolen another 50 francs from my drawer. 50 francs, Annette. You haven't seen them by any chance? - What? I'm an honest girl, Madame. - Yes. Mum... You might want to ask Carrot-top. He knows for sure. So now you're stealing from your mother? Leave that child alone! One day you're stealing an egg, the next you're stealing a cow, and then you'll be killing your mother! I told you to leave that child alone. - What? - You understand French? What? I forbid you to speak to him from now on. A wicked child? Who steals from me? - Dirty brat! - I forbid you...! Annette! F?lix! Ernestine! I forbid you to ever marry! Oh, it's terrible! To speak to me like that! This house! I've had all I can take of this filthy rubbish... - I'm going. - Oh, Madame! I won't stay another second in this house. This is all your fault. - Come on, Mum! - Come on. Dad, I want to leave this house. I'm old enough to earn a living. What? You're not happy with your family? Why didn't you say something? - Are you afraid of me? - Yes. Why are you always hiding? - You should speak up for yourself. - I would if I could. - You never speak when we're out hunting. - Nor do you. You're right. - You're always sulking. - No, Dad, I never sulk! So what are you doing, always hiding in the corners? I rage, against injustice. Leave her. She won't go far. I have to go. They're waiting for me at the town hall. Go and get dressed. You can come and join me. We'll eat together. And if I'm elected, we'll have a party. That'll snap you out of it. Go and put on your nice clothes, your Sunday ones. My Sunday clothes aren't nice, they're F?lix's cast-offs. Minus! What are you doing? I'm so happy! Dad and I are going to the party. Let me do that. You go and get dressed. - Oh, yes. - Go on, hurry. Give me the money. - Give me the money you promised! - Oh, leave me alone! Ah, here's the mayor. I'm late. You're quite sure you want to be married by me? You'll have a long wait if I'm not elected! Ah, the musicians. Are we going to have the elections set to music? Oh, if I was confident about this my shoes wouldn't feel so uncomfortable. Annette! Annette! Annette! M Lepic... M Lepic... A blank vote... M Merleron... M Lepic... M Merleron, one vote. Two blank votes. M Lepic, 9 votes. It's settled. M Lepic is elected. Ah yes, underneath the jacket. Time for a little speech. - Where are you going? - I'm taking up Carrot-top's shoes. - M Lepic is waiting for him. - Don't bother. Carrot-top is being punished. Annette! I forbid you... Annette! He's escaped. Oh, it's nice to be so well-behaved. I've brought you lollipops. Say, "Thank you, Auntie." - Thank you, Auntie. - Thank you, Auntie. Oh, he's not one of the wedding party, that one. After the ceremony, there'll be a party in the caf? across the road. Come on, your turn now. Mum! Mum! - He took the money. - Sneak! - She made me do it. - Liar! Stop it! Isn't it enough that I'm the most miserable wife? Now I'm to be the most wretched mother as well. Come on, F?lix, I won't be angry. But you're the eldest. Be sensible! Are you Annette? M Lepic sent me to tell you he's been elected, and that he won't be back for lunch. Goodbye! Did you hear that? Your wicked brother is no doubt with him. I'll go and see. I'll be needed there. Go and get your hat, my dear boy. No. I'm going to the fair. - I have a meeting. - You can go later. - Surely you want to come with your sister and me? - No. Enough! You're annoying me. You see, my little one? This is my reward. This is what they mean by the gratitude of men. Luckily, I still have you. Come along. No! Go on your own. I don't want people to see me there. My God... my God... - Sign here. - But I can't write, Mr Mayor. Then put a cross. Not only do I make the law, I practise it too. And I'll start by kissing the bride. You'll come and join the wedding party, Mr Mayor? - Where's that? - In the bar opposite. That works out fine. I was going there myself. The ceremony is finished. - Dad! - Yes, we'll talk later. Your health, Mr Mayor. To yours. You'll need it today! I'm joking! - Here I am, Dad. - Yes, I can see you. Leave me alone. I'm busy. Run along. Hey, it's Carrot-top! You need to stop growing and wait for your trousers to catch up. Hey, there he is, the little duck. OK? Give me a packet of shag. So did you try some ballet? Matches. What's the matter? You'll never be happier than today. It's not as if your mother doesn't love you. - She's a bad woman. - She's your mother! That's what you say. As for your father... he'll have a world of other preoccupations from now on. - Hello, Philippe! How are you? - I'm very well. I wanted to tell you... Carrot-top! You'll always be alone. Always! Run! To the pond. There's no other way. Look! The pond. Hello, Carrot-top! Hello, Mathilde. I'm going to find my Dad at the party. Are you coming? No? We'll never get married, Mathilde, because I'm going to kill myself. - Do you have to? - Yes. Since you feel it's necessary, Carrot-top, you'll have to do it. It's a pity, Carrot-top, because I really like you. Me too. Perhaps if I'd been more like my brother F?lix... Don't you want to kiss me, Carrot-top? - Are you going to jump in the water? - Yes. It's not very nice, because the water is dirty. And it's cold, too. You won't dare do it, Carrot-top. There's a rope in the barn. You saw it just now. Go and hang yourself! You'll see how easy it is to die. Come along. I'll take you to the party. Goodbye, Mathilde. So you've made your mind up? You're going to kill yourself? Yes. And then afterwards you'll come with me to the f?te? Yes, Mathilde. - Hello, Mathilde. - Hello. - Have you seen your fianc?? - Yes, he's coming back. He's coming back. Where's he gone? - To kill himself. - To kill himself! - To kill himself. - Yes. Hey, Mr Mayor! Do you know where your son is? - Let the mayor dance! - I'm exercising! This is no time for jokes. What are you singing about? I'm singing that people shouldn't have kids if they're not able to love them. You're drunk! Your son has gone to kill himself! What? Carrot-top has gone to kill himself. Half an hour ago, we were chatting like old friends. Carrot-top and me. It was too late. And now it may never be possible to put things right. Carrot-top! Carrot-top is trying to kill himself! Carrot-top! Carrot-top! Madame! Carrot-top is going to kill himself! He's incapable of doing it. It's pride! He's trying to make himself more interesting. Carrot-top! - Take off the rope! - No! - Take off the rope! - No, no! Take off the rope! Why? Why? Why? Daddy, I want to die. Why?... Why? Because I don't love my mother. And me? Do you think I love her? What did you say? I said... Do you think I love her? So, you're unhappy too? As unhappy as me? If that makes you happy. Come on. Let's not stay here. You were born too late, Carrot-top. - That's not my fault. - You're right. We weren't expecting you. By then, there was no love left between your mother and me. Listen, Carrot-top, the most important thing in a relationship is understanding, harmony. And compatibility of spirit. If you like. The character of Mme Lepic is exactly the opposite of mine. A family should consist of those whom we love, and those who love us. That's true. Do you love me, Daddy? Like a child that I lost and found. Come on. You've been unlucky. I was wrong about you, like I was wrong about your mother. I feel sorry for you, Dad. I'm young, but you... You'll spend all your old age with a woman who likes to make others unhappy. She's not happy, either. What do you mean, she's not happy? It's not so simple. She's not happy when she's hitting me? Yes. That's the only pleasure she gets from you. Does that surprise you? That someone who's incapable of being loved can suffer too. I'm not sure. There's an inn. Let's eat. A father is a good dad. A mother is a good mum. - If not, there's nothing. - You're right. - Your health, Fran?ois. - No more Carrot-top? Carrot-top is dead. He hanged himself in the barn. From now on, you're Fran?ois again. - For everyone? - For everyone. And from now on, you don't need to be afraid of anything at home. We're two now. - Your health, M Lepic. - Oh? Your health... my Daddy. English subtitles by Kinsayder at KG.
