Hi. I'm Albert Klippert, this is my assistant Karl Vogel and we're here today to tell you the truth with what's right and wrong with the world, and since this is our show we're always right. Good. I'm not his assistant. Apologies ladies and gentleman, please forgive my friend. He is obviously lacking in eloquence and simple common sense. I am his boss. Serve me an orange juice, blackhead. Fuck you, white trash! What is with you, man! Ok, we're partners! Don't say such things on camera. Relax, partner. I mean it. My dear, it must be difficult to be so good-looking. How do you cope? You're not going to get me through that bullshit. This is beneath me. You're so pretty. Anyhow, I have to admit, It's a big challenge. Fortunately, there aren't so many prospects around. Yes. Just a load of egotistic feminist bitches. You do know we're uploading this right? Delete that shit! Don't touch anything! That's our ticket. This film will make us rich and famous. We could finally leave this God-forsaken small town. Please. Because life is just that fucking easy. Wait, are we seriously uploading this? There you go again, with your rational sensibilities killing my dreams and ideas just like everybody else in this black hole. Were you even listening? I just told you, we're making an epic feature here. We've got two of the most interesting people I know right here. True, you're right. Then quit being small minded and pessimistic. How could we possibly reveal our talent that way? Sure, great talent. Yes. Yes. With that we bid all of you, a good day. Till our next episode. Objectively speaking, I would pay to see us. We're not recording anymore, you're so narcissistic sometimes. Reality TV effect. Audience wants big drama. What can I do? Authenticity. Karl. People seek the truth. Shut the fuck up Deepak. (YOUR COLOR) Good evening. Hello. Alright? I told you, man! Congratulations. You're a free man. See you later. Cheers. Cunt. Ok you can go in. He stays here. Why? I don't have to explain it to you. He has his ID with him. Show him your ID, Albert. What's the problem? It's my birthday, my friends are already inside, they're waiting for us. - It's fine, let it go. - No, why should I… Just go inside and then… No, come on, let's go. Fuck you. That's cool! That's cool! Let's upload this, it's great! No, man. Yes. No recording. Keep going! Come on! Albert, please, I can't stand it anymore. Leave, go somewhere else! Stop recording. Let's go. There's got to be a place out there where people aren't as wretched. I'm out of high school soon, I have a bit saved up. Let's get out of here. Anywhere. Let's go south. Anywhere else is better than here. I don't know… What about my mom? You're 18! You should leave your parents' house… - I am 17. I can't leave her alone. - It doesn't matter. My folks will probably be over the moon when I leave. They'll have their big house all to themselves. If I don't leave soon they'll force me to keep studying, take my masters, take over their business and basically live their life. How bad! Be rather grateful! You have a family behind you. You've got it easy. My mother is all alone. We're not rich like you. I don't want my parents' money. Hey. Edit this part out will ya. Sorry, I am… Hello my dearest. Ah there's the most handsome and best and smartest and most handsome boy in the world. Hey Karl. Hello Mrs. Klippert. Have you eaten yet? Do you want to eat? Shall I prepare something? I'm good, thank you. Why so happy Ma? Why not? Just happy to see my baby. - Karl. - Yes. I heard you make films now. When do I get to see something? - Are you in it? - No. You should be. Karl you should seriously consider my sweet boy here... Yeah, we'll do it, ma, ok? It's all fine... ok! I'll bake some brownies - Just go. and I want to watch the videos, ok! - Yes, we'll show you! - Look a camera, interesting. Poor baby, how do I make you better? Stupid forward hit my hand not the ball. It's probably just minor trauma. Because your hands are swollen, let's make sure to rule out bursitis or broken ligament. Let's wait a little and if it doesn't get better then we have it checked, okay? Okay. My little genius. You'll be the hottest doctor in town. Karl. I think I love you. Could you take me home? Why? How long have we been seeing each other, months! I left David to be with you, you won't even call me your girlfriend. I don't have time for this. I have to apply for Med-school soon. I'm not stopping you from doing so. Maybe we shouldn't be together. Seriously? I don't need to be here anymore. You talk about love, but you have no clue. And I don't know either but I don't give ultimatums. This is bullshit. Albert! What the hell are you doing? What? I asked you to cut the knuckles, not the ribs! - I told you four times! - I did cut the knuckles! - You didn't! - I did! I know what knuckles look like, you don't! Ok, sorry... But it was... Albert! Albert, you fuck everything up. Just go, go now! Why? Because I can. I didn't do anything! Exactly! You didn't do anything! I didn't mean to... Just go! Just get out of here! Now! Just get out of here, now! Are you serious? I'm fucking serious! Fine, I'm out! Yeah! I go! Take this shit! I don't give a fuck! Hello... Everybody... Karl disappeared. I'm talking to myself. I can't do this. I can't. Hi. My dear. So. I re-read it. You did well. You only have to watch out for syntax. But it's ready for submission. I can? Great. Yes, very good. Thank you. Also... I fixed your favorite polo. Yeah, you're the best. What the hell is this? It's nothing, mama. Ouch, ma, it's nothing! Nothing? No. This is drugs! It's illegal! Albert, I work my ass off. For you, for our house, not to raise an addict. Yeah ma. It's just weed. Don't exaggerate, calm down please. Calm down? You know who you sound like? "Nadine, calm down, it's just alcohol." You know what your father turned into? A fucker! An alcoholic! Do you want to end up like him, yeah? A piece of shit? When does it finally get into your head? Yeah... You're a loser. It runs in your blood! Now listen carefully. If I catch you one more time you are out the door. Is it clear? - Yes. - Is it clear? Yes. Look at me. Yes. And dear, clean this shit, yea? What's going on? Not now, Karl, please. Time to open up Albert Klippert. I mean it. Who or what is causing you to feel this way? This is personal, Karl! Stop it. Man I told you not to touch the lens. What's going on? My mom has gone berserk again. She wants me out of the house. I just want to ask you if I can stay here for a couple of days till things blow over. Relax, man! Mi casa es su casa. Remember how we talked about leaving? Of course, man. It was my idea. Let's do it! What? I'm serious, man. Every day is the same old shit. We don't get along with the people. They all wear such faces… and their shit, shit, shit. My balls are freezing half the year, man. I feel out of place. I can't even feel at home in my own house. I want to have my own place. My own place where I do whatever I want. Where nobody tells me what to do, man. I want to be free. If I don't leave soon, I'll go insane. Crazier than my mother. Well thank God your mom is a crazy bitch. - I was waiting for you to come to your senses. - Hey, wait, wait. Let's get one thing straight. I can curse my own family, you can't, okay? I mean it. Sorry, it was a joke. So where are we going? Let's go somewhere… I need hot women for sure. Good weather. And maybe a beach... Barcelona. Barcelona? You Moron! Hello. You're so stupid. Put that down! You're missing out on all this! Look at that! - Hey! - Hi, alright? - You made it! - How are you? Good to see you again. How are you? Good... still job hunting, but... There's an opening in my office. If you want to, I can ask for you... - Sure. - Cool. - Thanks. - Cool. I can't, Karl, I can't. Fuck you. I can't, Karl, let it go... Stop it, stop it. Aren't you late for that interview I set up? I have twenty minutes. You haven't even showered. Get off my back. You're distracting me. I'm losing. Albert. I don't want to bitch but I paid the rent and settled all the bills last month. Where is your contribution? Karl. I didn't leave my mother's house to be nagged by another control freak. You'll get the money as soon as I get this job. I had to beg my new boss to get you this opportunity. Show some gratitude. Who said I wanted this job anyway? What? Check that ass. The jerk! Girls here seem to be much more laid back than back home. I feel so much better here. Me too. What are you doing today? I don't know. I'm going to do club promotion with Julio. We just try to get people to come to the club. Talk with them. 10 euros per head. Free drinks. Easy money. Do you want to come? I don't know. I can't stand Julio. Why? If I don't have anything better to do, maybe. I guess that's a yes. Sounds like it. - That's a yes. - No. You're coming! We party! This sucks. I've been out here for 2 hours only 1 guy took a flyer from me. It's our first day, man. Your negative energy is repelling clients. Just give me the tickets, I'll get rid of them in half an hour, okay? Okay. Alright. Let's go to Crystal afterwards. I'm supposed to look forward to this because...? Free booze? Man... Julio has a table. I want to go there, okay? I don't want to hang out with this old lady. But with Julio the dealer? He's promoting a club tonight... He's nothing but a small time criminal. And you are judgmental. No, I'm just saying that Julio's influence in this city is weak. It won't get us anywhere. Does everything always have to be about gaining something? Profit, profit, profit... Yes... Can't we just hang out? Can we? Of course, we can... All I'm saying is that right now we have to be practical. There's nothing wrong about being selective about the people you hang around. Everyone wants to have fun... But hanging out with people like Julio just makes you more hollow and stupid. Karl, man, this is pissing me off really. Didn't you just call Julio two hours ago to replenish your stash? That has nothing to do with this. And how is Crystal the better choice? Because Crystal is well connected in Barcelona. Who told you all that? Julio. Great. That's beside the point. I'm just thinking maybe she could help get us in the circle. Why would she want to do that for us? Explain it to me, please. Because she's old, she's lonely. She needs company. Okay, what are you suggesting? Let's befriend her that's all. - Hello mom, what's up? - Hey sweetheart, how are you? Good, good.. - I miss you - I miss you too, mom... I just wanted to tell you I've sent you money What? Was it too much? No, not a lot, just a bit - Thank you! - It's fine... How are you? I'm fine. Missing you! I miss you, too! I gotta go. I love you And I love you more, bye! Bye, baby We're broke. Rent is coming up. I'm on it. How was the interview? I guess they didn't like me. You didn't even try. I showed up! That's not enough. They didn't like me because I didn't finish high school or because I'm not white like you. Don't use that fucking card again, okay? Man, that's an excuse. You're the only one putting limitations on yourself. It's true! You've always gotten preferential treatment. What? You've always gotten preferential treatment. We both know it very well, man. You're not even aware of it. I want special treatment too! Don't you understand it? It's not about that! If you want to be treated equally, don't ask for special treatment, okay? How can you affirm that when you can't even acknowledge the discrepancy in opportunity. You're over analyzing the situation. That's not the issue. I don't want to work for the both of us, that is the point! - Karl. - What? Come here. Let's smoke this joint - Albert, man! - And everything will be ok. It's 8 in the morning, I have work. I thought about it and if you don't come up by the end of this month with at least half the rent, then... you should start finding a new apartment. Are you serious? Hello? Kristina? What's going on? I'm happy you're here. But you could just come back and we could make something together. Or I just come here with you. Kristina, you know, maybe we're not ready yet. We still have to find ourselves. You know how much I like you but... we can't do this now. But I love you. Go home to your father. Fix things with your family. Finish school, straighten out your life. You have a lot to offer, Kristina. I don't know if I can give what you deserve. You know, maybe... maybe one day? Let's just enjoy tonight. Why don't you want to be with me? I am with you now. And then what? Let's not talk about this. You're such a coward. Just be honest and tell me the truth. Is it David? Yes, maybe. Maybe it's better if you go back to David. He can take care of you. But I want to be with you, why don't you get it? Go back to David. I may have been hella fucked up last night but I am pretty sure that was Kristina leaving the apartment. I don't want to talk about it. Shit, Albert. This is shit! Can you please keep the messiness within your room? This is a common area. What was Kristina doing here? What do you mean? Either you're damn good in bed or she has no self esteem. Must be the latter. How do you think I treat her? I'm just an honest guy I tell it how it is. A little filtering won't do any harm, Karl. Oh you're an expert Dr. Love? I'll ask for advice when I need it, I don't want to put so much effort thinking of what to say, I refuse to live that way. That's bullshit. Fair enough. I'm celebrating my birthday today because my mother will be visiting tomorrow. Shit. Want to do the new strip club by Centro? Heard the girls are hot. Happy birthday. I forgot. Did you get me a gift? How about I won't nag you about your debt for one week, okay? Deal. Taxi! There is one, there is one. - Hey mom, we talked about it already! - When? I've told you that... You're so unreliable! You know what? Fuck this Ma! What the hell do you mean? And you wonder why Dad left? He abandoned you! I don't blame him! I blame you! Got it? So I'm the one to blame, yeah? Hello? I'm talking to you! I'm warning you! Hello? Hello? Hey mama. You've just hurt me so much... Ok, I'm sorry, I am... You're destroying me, like your father. What? You're just like your father! Hey mama, don't exaggerate now. I can't anymore. Ma, Ma! I can't anymore! It's my fucking birthday. Give me a break, please. I don't give a damn! I don't want to live anymore You're crazy. - Mama, please stop this shit. - I can't anymore, I can't live like this. I can't stand it, mama. Do you think I still want to see you after this? -I don't give a fuck, I'll come anyway! It was stupid to ask you to come. -I'll come. I don't want to see you! -Fuck you! Fuck yourself! Man! Are you insane? Are you brainless? You're paying for that. - It's not our apartment. - Fuck off, man, fuck off! I'm tired of people telling me what to do. You're not exactly in a position to tell me what to do. Don't get on my fucking nerves too. Fuck off, kid. Shit. Fuck, man. You think you're better than me just cause you're making more than I am? What? Oh boy, you're so full of yourself. You're just like my mother. Don't drag me into your family issues, okay? That's none of my business. You're just like her. You're a motherfucking nag and fucking egoistic. I wouldn't be nagging if you just handed over your dues. I would have been better off with a boarder. You don't have enough to pay the rent yet you have all the time and the money for your nights out and drugs. Every night! How I spend my time and money is none of your business. It is when you owe me 3000 euros! You have shit here, man. What? Don't you see it for yourself? You've lost your soul over money. - I didn't. - Sure you did, man. Your greed, your ambition are blinding you, Karl. They are blinding you. You don't know what really matters anymore. You have no idea. You want to jeopardize our friendship for 3000 euros? It's not about the money! It's about the principle! Obviously you're a man of none. Mr. I'd do anything to get rich quick is going to teach me about principles and integrity? Teach me please. Come here, teach me. No. I'm not going to apologize for my ambitions, man. I can still look at myself in the mirror. At least I am doing something. - What kind of a friend are you? - Man. I gave you all the time and chances. I scored you interviews for job openings. What have you done, eh? All you did was fuck around. You know what sucks the most? You have a head, man. You have potential but you're not using your head, man. You're wasting your life away. You think I want to live like that, or what? That's not how I want to live, man. I imagined it all different too, Karl. And again, I didn't get the job cos I was discriminated! You're using this complex as a cop out. You got discriminated for your laziness. Don't you see it? Don't blame anything or anyone else. You know exactly how people have been towards me. Stop superciliously judging from your high chair, okay? You fucking asshole, man. I'll pay you back every Goddamn cent. Fuck you, man. Fuck off. Get out of the apartment. This is our apartment. This is my apartment. I've asked you a million times to clean up your shit. You've forfeited your right to this place. I've lost my savings providing for you. Do you even realise that? You know I don't have money. I don't fucking care. Ask Julio, or borrow from your mother. You're kicking me out on my birthday? I don't fucking care if it's your birthday or goddamn Christmas. Alright. Fuck off. I'll leave tomorrow. Jerk. Hey, what are you doing here? I just brought back the keys upstairs. Cool, thanks. You can stay in the couch until you find another place. No, no problem. I'll stay at Julio's. Okay, cool. I hope you're fine. I am great and you? Yes, me too. Alright then. We'll see. Call sometime. Alright. KARL: YOU'VE GOT MAIL I don't know, maybe it's the menopause. It's your mum. I've been avoiding her. What does she want? She wants me to go back to school. Get a proper job. Help her out. But in a really demanding way, so fuck that. I love her, I really do but... I decide what happens to my life, right? Yes. And what would that be? No idea, man. Maybe it's not such a bad idea. I've been thinking about going back to school myself. I've been checking out some schools online. Serious? Sure, why not? Get a degree, a comfortable life, a job with more money. I think I've reached a dead end here. I don't want to live like this. I have no idea, but... I am not staying here. Wow. Thanks. You're welcome, sure. So what are you planning to take up? Maybe business or management? Really? I'm just trying to find a course that I enjoy but still be practical. Yes. Right? Didn't you want to be a filmmaker and I was going to be an actor. That's an option too - Yes. but it might be too unstable. What about the videos? I have them in my computer. You still have them? Sure. Send them to me. Yes. We should have uploaded those. I promise you. We should have uploaded those, man. We could've been famous by now. I just know it. So how's work with Julio? It's cool... - Great, perfect. - Cool. We're going to the shooting range. Come with us. It'll be really cool. He knows them, we get in for free. Have fun. Look... One beer, ok? Just stay for one beer, it's not that bad. Send me the videos, okay? - Hello? - Hello. Sir is this Albert Klippert? Who is it? I just wanted to confirm if this is the number of Albert Klippert. Yes, I am Albert Klippert, why? There's been an accident. Hello. Are you still there, sir? Hello. Sir, how are you related to Miss Nadine Klippert? Do you think this is funny? If this is a joke, you're dead. It's not a joke, sir. I just wanted to know if the two of you are related. Yes, she is my mother. What happened to her? Sir, I'm very sorry to inform you that your mother was involved in a car accident today at around 1pm this afternoon. What are you talking about? She hit the back of a truck that was parked on the shoulder. What the fuck are you talking about? Where is my mother? Are you or any next of kin near St. Joseph's to identify the body? I am the only one she's got. It can't be. My condolences. It cannot be... Look sad, Karl... All the girls are angry... I can also do happy face. Do happy face. You're shining. You're shining white. White. White. Could you grant me a wish? Next week I want to have a hot girl, with big tits. Why are you in a good mood, ma? Just because. I am happy to see you! Karl, I heard you make films now. APPLICATION DENIED Albert! It's been a long time. Wait, give me a sec. How are you? Yeah I'm at this place by Centro, my co-workers are throwing a despedida party. I got the scholarship from the University. I'm going to Berlin! I didn't call you because I figured you were busy. Come here, I'll send you the address. What about it? Albert? Yeah. I just want to say I am proud of you, man. Proud of you... You're doing the right thing, believe me. What's wrong? Why are you being such a cheeseball? - I am serious, Karl, you... - You don't sound good. You're doing the right thing, you... You're a cool guy, man. Thank you. Keep it up, man. How are you? What are you up to? It's all good, all good. I have been working on our film... and I put musical score as well. You put musical score on it? How cool. I've forgotten all about that. What happened to living in the moment and being real? What happened? People change, Karl. Yes. So I'll send you the address, come here, okay? Okay? I'll try. Hello. Hey Karl, I heard about Albert's mom. I'm sorry for his loss. What are you talking about? Oh you didn't hear? She died in an accident on her way to Barcelona. VOICEMAIL It's me, bro. I've heard about your mom. Call me back, okay? LIVESTREAM: A Documentary by Albert and Karl Hey, nah? You know that I am... I am usually camera shy... So... Surprise! I worked on our video blogs. Good times, bro. I know your birthday is coming up and I got you something. My mom left me this. I want to give it to you. For your university and your future. You will make it, I know it. And I wanted to say thank you. I've never had a real family... but because of you, I never felt like I was missing out on anything. I love you, man. For real, bro. Take care. See you. Please! Sorry. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. Albert and Karl. Hey Karl, how cool is that? Yes! We could live here forever! Forever! Haunting shadows in full bloom Stars concealed by the light of the moon Beautiful smiles herald impending doom Your color fades degradingly a tinge too soon The ray of light was once a child life has beguiled Repeatedly your game has been to seek and hide Come back tonight just one more time restore the sight Let not your color fade so soon without a fight I can't wait to get away from here. I don't know maybe I will... I'm going to miss home. Me too. But we'll find a new home. The question is where. Wherever we go.
