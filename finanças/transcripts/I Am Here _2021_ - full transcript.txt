[door opening] [projector running] I will warn you that the images you are about to see are graphic. Hate crimes against the community are on the rise. And we're going to take you inside that synagogue where the attackers carried out that bloody rampage. A Nazi flag flying above an Australian suburban backyard. And we have to remember that for a Holocaust survivor, seeing the Nazi flag is as scary and as frightening as being threatened with a gun. You f*#*#*# nasty-ass Jew! You stink! Because over the past year, attacks against Jewish people have risen by more than 70%. I don't care about your fake Holocaust. It's very simple Yes We are pure-blooded, you are mixed mongrels. Expel the Jews, that's what every country has done. That you deny the Holocaust. Yes, I deny the Holocaust, it's an extortion racket! Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! [Howard Feldman] A South African social influencer penned the most terrible things. She effectively denies the Holocaust and blamed the Jews for burning people alive in Germany and many members of the community outraged. One such reaction caught me by surprise. Along comes a woman by the name of Ella Blumenthal. She's 98-years-old, she's a Holocaust survivor what amazed me about this was instead of condemning the person who posted it, she reached out an arm of friendship, and even of love. She offers to meet with her and to share their stories. She says that she is a victim of fake news and propaganda, as was Ella back in the time of the war, and Ella Blumenthal is capable of writing a letter that says that there is more that unites us than divides us. Incredible generosity of spirit. Would any of us- I know I would battle with it, would any of us be able to reach out, with love, to the very person who denies your own history? * Yiddish folk music [Ella Blumenthal] Mmmm, I don't need any perfume, any Chanel No 5. Have you got problems? [Gabbi - friend] No. Call me, I'll fix it. [tempo speeds up] * Yiddish folk music Now you look a mensch! He's quite good-looking, this guy! Remember, I will tell you stories, and you will tell your children. Who does it? Old people, not me! What do I worry about Ferrari shmerrari. I've got the drive and the energy. [scribbling sounds] [family talking in background] Aah! Sorale! Whoever told you that I'm old, look at me. You want me to dance a little bit, or make a tango, or a polka? L'chaim, l'chaim! All my children, my grandchildren, I'm so happy that you all here today. [laughing happily] [blowing deeply] * jovial [Ella] I was born in Warsaw, in 1921. The youngest in a family of seven children. I was actually a very naughty girl. I was full of nonsense, always. I enjoyed swimming very much and we used to kayak through the white Vistula River, * light fluttering and I remember that we used to play, * light fluttering to sing and we used to dance. [warplane engines getting louder] I was a happy teenager -[warplanes pass overhead] -[Ella] until the outbreak of the war. [dramatic music] [soldiers boots stomping] [Ella] When the Nazi Germans invaded Poland, there was a lot of panic and fear. [bombs exploding] [warplanes rumble] [Ella] All Jewish bank accounts were frozen, all Jewish land was requisitioned, we had to wear armbands on the sleeve of the outer garment, we had to hand over our radios, food was rationed, curfew was imposed, all the Jewish schools and synagogues were closed. [chaotic shouting] [baton thudding] [melancholy music] [waves crashing] [seagulls screeching] [Ella] My brother-in-law was still there. He said, "I beg you - don't stay, don't wait, it's a disaster. We won't survive here under the Nazis." So, the people said, "Argh, he's a writer, an author, he's dreaming, he's exaggerating, he's... don't believe him!" So, people, they never realised that such a tragedy, that such a disaster can come to us, that they would just kill us. [threatening music] [frightened murmur] [Ella] We managed just to pack some of our belongings into sheets and we were herded into the ghetto. [barbed wire twisting] [sinister sounds] [Ella] The ghetto was overcrowded, there were ten to fifteen people living in a room, there was malnutrition, starvation, epidemic and disease, starving children in rags were begging in the street. When we got up one morning, we found placards and notices on the wall: "Every grown-up and child must come down, and they must bring food for three days, and don't close the doors! Leave the doors open! Anybody found after this particular hour is going to be shot." Obviously, people came down. [apprehensive murmuring in street] People that were caught, they were sent to labour camps that's what they claimed, the Nazis, but afterwards, we realised what was going on. How come that they sending old people and children also to labour camps? Old people can't work, children can't work, babies can't work, but when we realised that some of the people never came back, we realised that there must be something wrong. [anxious shouting] In these various raids and roundups, I lost almost my entire family 23 souls my mother, my brothers, my sisters, their spouses and seven nieces and nephews, and they were sent away to Treblinka. * pensive [Ella] And just by some chance, there were three of us left my father and my niece, Roma, and myself. The underground organisation printed leaflets: * upbeat "Citizens, Jews, go underground * upbeat and hide in cellars and bunkers, turn every building into a fortress, as we have no right to occupy the surface of the earth because we are condemned to death." [baby cries] [soldiers talking] [soldier cocks weapon] [baby cries] [hushing baby] [babies cries loudly] [baby's cry is silenced] and this is that night my father gave us all, when we were sitting in that bricked-up room, each one of us got a little piece of matzah, he saved it from the previous year and then... he was saying the blessings for the matzah and he prayed to God to save us, like he saved us Jews from bondage in Egypt. [dramatic music build-up] [baby cries] [mother hushes baby] [Ella] We heard the Nazis marching in for their usual, routinely looking for people, searching, but suddenly, they were met by Molotov cocktails. There was shooting coming down from rooftops and windows. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was on and the Germans were taken by surprise. Believe it, there was Nazis' blood flowing in the streets of the Warsaw Ghetto. But unfortunately, they couldn't stand up to the mighty, well-equipped German army and the uprising was crushed. They set the ghetto on fire, building by building. There was no option, we had to come out. The sight of the burning ghetto is forever in my eyes, in front of me. I can never erase it from my mind and the smell of the burning feathers, from the beddings, is forever in my nostrils. [distressing screams] to let me be shot first, before my father, who was standing next to me. [crying, weeping] [train whistle] [train on tracks] [Ella] We were chased to Umschlagplatz. Umschlagplatz was a station where the cattle trucks were packed with human cargo and returned empty, ready for another load. [rhythmic sound of train wheels] [door creeks open] [Ella] We had to stay over because the train wasn't there. We had to sit in an empty hall and at night, guards came in and pulled out young girls. [foreboding music crescendos] [guard smirks] [guard grunts] [girl shrieks] [terrified scream] [terrified cries fade away] [carriage doors squeal closed] [anxious shouting] * hopeful [train sounds fade away] [Ella] We were sent to that horrible, terrible place, Majdanek. [barbed wire twisting] [sinister sounds] [guard dogs barking] -[guard dog biting] -[screams in pain] -[guards laugh mockingly] -[girls sobs] [Ella] Links, rechts, links, rechts! "Right to life, left to gas chambers!" I was afraid that I wouldn't pass, but Roma assured me she'll follow me wherever I am sent. When it was my turn to present myself, I raised my head high, my shoulders, -[Ella] and I was sent to right and so was Roma, and then it was the turn for the men and my father was among them. So, as he was marched, he turned back to have a last look at Roma and I, -[grunts] -[Ella] and he was hit over the head -[cries out] -[Ella] and he bent under the blow. [soldiers shouting] [Sobbing] I never, never saw my father again, never. [laughing happily] * merry [laughing fades away] * merry [inaudible prayer] [guards giving instructions, whipping] [cries of pain] -[guards shouting] -[Ella] We were sent to an open space and one of our friends was led to the gallows and there was a rope put around her neck, [guard dogs barking] -[body drops] -[Ella] and then she was hanging and just her eyes came out and we had to watch it, and we called Shema Yisrael, "Help us God", but it didn't help. [gallows rope creaking] The Kommando of the camp was standing and he proudly announced, "This is what is going to happen to any of you, who will try to escape!" As we were standing, it was cold, so we stood close to each other to keep warm and Roma, my niece, was telling us about the Shabbos at home, just to make us feel happier. The smell of the food, how it was coming from the kitchen, the freshly baked challahs and the roast, and she spoke about it so clearly that we all felt that we were there, and it gave us pleasure, at least for a minute, to think. [gallows rope creaking] [guard dogs barking] * tranquil [Ella] Can I do yours? You're not doing it right. Can I do it for you? My mum, after she made Friday morning, before she went to business she used to put the dough under my duvet to rise. [Evelyn - Ella's daughter] Why under the duvet? [Ella] Because... it was winter, a lot of cold weather and we had to wait until the dough rises, so there was no other way and then afterwards, she plaited it. I make the challahs. I remember exactly how it was at home. [pot boiling rapidly] [burning, bubbling] [Ella] One day, Roma and I were sent out of the women's camp to the men's camp, which was unheard of. Some of them came running, asking, "Perhaps you've seen my wife, Sorale, she was wearing a floral dress?" Next one ask me, "Gitile, my little girl, she had blue eyes"" but we couldn't answer them even if we had the time, they were chased out and we were forced to march forward. [door slams shut] We were pushed into a bathhouse, but it wasn't a bath, it was a gas chamber * suspenseful music * and I was holding my niece's hand and I was whispering, "Don't be afraid, it won't hurt, it won't even take long, we will soon join our loved ones." At this very minute, an SS man came in and shouted, "Ruhe!" "Quiet! You not going to be gassed". We couldn't believe it, we thought it's another trick of the Germans. [guards shouting orders] [Ella] And there were some men, they said, "You very lucky that you still alive. The order that the Germans received was to gas 500 Jewish women, not 700." Our transport was 700. Because of the German orderliness, they told us, that we were saved. [guards shouting commands] * serene I never lost hope, never. Even in the darkest times of my life. If you ask me, if I would've known what I'm going through, if I'd change my beliefs, I would have said, "No, I'd rather go through again, even if we are killed and chased. I still want to be what I am." * joyful * foreboding [Ella] We were sent from Majdanek to Auschwitz. [barbed wire twisting] [sinister sounds] [electric fence buzzing] [Ella] When we arrived, we had showers and then our hair was shaven. I couldn't recognise Roma, I was calling for her, because we looked so different. -[painful cries] -[Ella] Then our arms were tattooed, -[painful cries] -[Ella] and my number was '48632' and below the number was a triangle - this was a sign of a Jew. When my children asked me, what was the scar on my arm, I said, "It was an accident". I wouldn't talk about my suffering and fight for survival because the open wounds were still bleeding in me. [indistinct girls chatter] [prisoners play-acting] [laughing] [door bangs open] [footsteps approach] [guard growls] [Guard: You!] [Ella] We had a feeling that we were going to the gas chambers. There was a nurse sitting at the back. I realised that I knew her. It was my friend, Lena Bunker, but she was not there as a Jewess, she was as a Christian, as a Polish girl. I just looked at her and the strength of my eyes, she realised what I was trying to say, "I know you! I know who you are." [laughing] * carefree [guard dogs barking] [Ella] So, I was saved by my friend, Lena Bunker. [computer starting up] [Trudy Van Rooy - friend] Have you connected with a lot of friends on Facebook? [Ella] Yes, yes, yes, yes. -[laughing in background] -[Ella] I sit till late at night. I'm in touch with people that I haven't seen for ages. I love to talk to people, I love to meet people, I like to hear about them because I want to understand human nature. I love to see people, how they grow, how they... what they're doing and what their likes... It's very important. Make friends and show them a smile and kindness because it always comes back. -[rocks clatter on ground] -[guards reprimanding] [Ella] We decided, Roma and I, that we should try our luck and get one of the SS men to give us work under a roof. * ominous * "We have been so long in Auschwitz; we're still working in the open fields. Please can you help us, that we should be working in a Kommando under the roof?" [guards talk indistinctly in background] "Sind Sie noch da?" And he looked, he says, "Are you still here?" Because people with the numbers 48000, there weren't many still around, most of them were gone. And I was offered to be a blockälteste, the top, looking after everybody in the block-house and it was a wonderful job to be a blockälteste. We were in charge, she never went to... never had to stand to roll calls, she had a special room. She had a little window with a small curtain and there was a bed there with a sheet, but you had to hit the girls and you had to pull out from the roll calls - those that were sick, and they were sent to the gas chambers. It was a terrible job. I said, "I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to send my sisters to the gas chambers"" I said, "No. Thank you, but no"" [electric fence humming] [cold wind blows] [Ella] Roma was begging me, "Come, let's end this fight. We will never survive. Let us join our loved ones. In any case, the only way to get out of Auschwitz is through the chimneys"" I had to beg her, as I was not ready to die. [electric hum intensifies] * uneasy I said, "We must carry on and if we survive, we will tell the world what these murderers have done to us." [sobbing, crying] I don't know how I managed to do it. Where did I get the strength? Because I was hungry. If I come to think of it today, there was a power that pushed me. I knew this is the way I've got to survive, I will survive, and I prayed to God to give me the strength! [snow crunches underfoot] [guard dogs barking] Somebody must have got it into Auschwitz, I don't know how. It was so wonderful to see the Hebrew words * ominous [laughing happily] and I kept it all the way until we survived, and I've still got it. It's so dear to me. * soulful [Ella] If you think that good luck or good fortune has saved me, it's wrong. It's somebody up there. He's looking after me, He's giving me strength to fight, pushing me to survive, holding me up. So, don't think it was just luck. [ominous music] [Ella] Roma and I were sent from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, in a large transport. [barbed wire twisting] [sinister sounds] [Ella] People were falling like flies from disease and hunger. The bodies were piled up outside each block-house. The stench was unbearable. When I saw this, I realised I mustn't land up on the heap of these corpses in Bergen-Belsen... and the will of survival was so strong in me! I said "No, I must carry on. I'll have to survive with God's help." [match striking] * reflective [Ella] People come to me, they want blessings, they said that it will help if I, because I went through it, I had the number and I've got some sort of power. I hope so. [doorbell chimes] Hello... [Jordy - friend] Let me help you down. [Gabbi - friend] Ella! So happy to have you in our home! -[Naomi] Lovely, nice to see you. Nothing brings people together like good food. -[laughing] Did you get it from the Torah? I'm sorry, I'm not going to use it. [all laughing] [Naomi] She'll put it in her pocket! Watch it all, I'm not doing it behind your eyes. I want you to see it. [all laughing] It's worthwhile doing this. [knife cuts into table] [Ella] I was chosen to work in one of the kitchens and I was trying to organise pieces of vegetable, sometimes even there was meat there, * menacing [Ella] but one day, -[Ella] I hid something under my underwear and there was a Russian prisoner working in the kitchen and he saw that the Oberster Führer, in his office, noticed me doing it. [wheelbarrow wheels squeaking] He said, "Throw it in, quickly"" [gasps] [guard gives instruction] and I was searched, but they couldn't find it. [guard reacts angrily] [guard orders her out] [gasping] Who left this lovely biscuit? [laughter] No food must be wasted! The plate must be clear, did you hear? -[Menachem] Yes. Think! I was hungry. I was dying for a crumb. It's not a story, it's true. [footsteps approaching] There were things that you looked at differently and you thought about and you had a different perspective on life. You like to not waste, you like to save for tomorrow. It's probably subconscious but do you, did you... [Ella] You want to say "stingy"? Call a spade a spade. [Jade - granddaughter] It's a big procedure. Because I am going to use one tea bag. I'm not going to throw away. Paul says, "My mother-in-law makes five cups, five cups of tea with one tea bag." He tells everybody in Shull! Correct. [Jade - granddaughter] Your scarf. Oh! [sobbing] [Ella] When I came out, the Russian said to me, "If we survive the war, you are coming with me to Russia!" I knew he saved my life, I had to play along. I said, "Alright," and when we were liberated, he came to me. I said, "No, I'll come, I'll follow you." Obviously, I never did. [laughing] [Jordy - friend] Why didn't you go? [Ella] To Russia? First of all, I had Roma with me, whom I looked after right through the war. I said, "I will come, you go. I'll follow you." [Evelyn] You said that a few times to a few men, didn't you? You promised a few men that you would follow them. Ah yes, there was somebody else, in Paris. So, it was your modus operandi. Oh, he was in love with me! You were always going to follow people, but you had no intention... He says, "no!" [Evelyn] Not for you. No, no. [paper flutters to ground] [Ella] We had a sign that something is happening, that maybe we going to be freed, because in the watchtowers, we saw some of them wearing white bands and the others were completely empty even, and I also saw them running, pushing lots of papers and documents. I realise now they must have been taking it to be burnt. [guards arguing in background] * woeful [gasping while running] [prisoners murmuring] [tank engines rumbling] [Ella] I couldn't... imagine that it was true, but it was. We were free! [music crescendos] [sobbing with joy] [Ella] We were soon transferred from our camp to the camp where the SS men used to live, which had a bed and a blanket, under the blanket was a sheet and there was a pillow, but believe it, what we found was a tap with water, with a small sink, running water. Unbelievable! * peaceful I remember the first time that we had a bath, Roma and I, and we both shared the bath. This was something wonderful, to be in a bath. We were lying for hours, like this. This was our first enjoyment, at the bath. I had to help her to get through and she got through with me. So, that's all I've got from my whole family. From the 24 people, I've got my niece Roma who's alive. When she's not well, I feel it; I'm also not well and the same, she feels when I'm not well. We are just like one person because it's unbelievable what we went through together. [cell phone rings] [cell phone is answered] Hi, I want to see your mouth. Now it's much better. Thank you, now it's clear. How's it going? -[Roma] Very good. -[Ella] Everything all right? It's such nice weather, wonderful, I am very happy. Rami is also next to me. Oh, I'm so glad, I'm happy to hear. Ella, how are you? Everything is fine, there's no problems. Very good. Happy Birthday! I wish you a long and good life. I am very thankful to you, for you do for me, all the time, all the time. [Roma] You helped me to continue to live. Happy Birthday, mamaleh. Thank you, thank you so much. I'm so grateful for when we talk to each other. Alright, I'll say goodbye now, for now. My tea's getting cold and you know I don't like cold tea. [Roma] I will speak to you soon. Be well. [Roma] I love you, mamaleh. Love. Bye-bye. God bless. Look after yourself also. [Roma] God bless you. Bye. [Roma] Bye-bye. [call ended] [train noise] [Ella] I travelled to Poland. I was just thinking, perhaps somebody survived from my family. I walked on the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. I went back to the place where we lived. * sorrowful [echoing memories of laughter] [whimpers sadly] [Ella] Why was I chosen to survive? Why? [speaking with great sadness] Everybody around me is gone. [speaking with great sadness] Why it was me that stayed here? * heartening [deep sigh] * uplifting [Ella] We had permission to travel from Germany to Paris [French chatter] and there were people living normal lives people were shopping, children were around, there was a world! A tailor made two beautiful suits for us and they were the first garments that were our own. We enjoyed wearing these suits every day, almost, and we treasured it, really. [Ella] I travelled to Palestine by boat. [fireworks exploding] [Ella] At the end of the year, I met a South African man, Isaac Blumenthal. * romantic music -[Isaac laughing] [car engine stops] [door opens] He asked, "May I see you tomorrow?" I said, "Alright, be my guest"" All the pictures that we've seen of you, you know, you were a young, very pretty girl. What do you think, your father didn't see? [background laughter] He saw very well. He was wearing glasses, but... he saw me properly, don't worry. * playful [Ella] I had to get permission from Roma. I asked her, "Can we part? We'll have to part because I'm going to a country in Africa." [camera motor whirs] I got married after knowing him only for 13 days. Normally, every bride will say it's the happiest time in her life. I didn't know what was happening, it was like a dream! I was going into the unknown, but I knew that I was having somebody next to me who loved me, who understood me, who cared about me. [Ella] Soon after my arrival in Johannesburg, the family of my husband advised me that I should remove my number, that I should forget about my struggles, about my terrible life. * pensive My life was happy with my husband, but I could not mix with people. I had no family. It was all people around me who didn't understand me, who didn't know me, who didn't realise what I went through. So, I tried to never talk about it. But only when I was building my own family and my children were arriving, I felt that this is what I am able to do to look after my husband, my children. [Norman] There's the so-called second generation of survivors, we've always felt that we've been overprotected, been difficult, we've always been different and our relationships with people, with family, wives, has always been different and had that effect. There was always an undercurrent of something going on, but as we got older, maybe in the teenage years, she just started telling information. Me, being the youngest, I picked it up along the way. There was certainly something different in all of us. [Alvin] In spite of you bottling it up internally, I remember vividly, you would just scream in the middle of the night, and then again and again, and then it was quiet, and then you would scream and in spite of you not talking about it during the day. Because I was, I was worried that the Nazis are taking my children from me. [Evelyn] I remember that. [Alvin] I always imagined, 50 years ago, when she used to tell me the cut on her arm was due a car smashed into a shopfront and the glass broke and it cut her arm open, and to this day, I remember imagining as a kid, a car mounting the pavement, driving into the shopfront and this sharp glass cutting and tearing her arm open. She so impregnated that story in my mind, that I remember it to this day. * solemn [Ella] We bought a departmental store in Brakpan, Johannesburg and we modernised it, and it was a very known and successful business. * wistful [Ella] We moved to Cape Town because my husband was ill, and it only took a few months and he passed away. We prayed, we tried to keep him alive, but nothing worked. He was called, he was gone. * reminiscent So, we only live with memories now. Roma lives, now, in Manhattan, New York. She has about 18 grandchildren and over 30 great-grandchildren. They are all very religious and they've got big families. Some years ago, I went to visit Poland. I remembered every spot in Auschwitz. It was like a dream. I was alive and I had children and a grandchild with me, standing there. It was just a miracle. I went to Treblinka where my family was sent away, but there was nothing left, only stones. [Ella] The hatred is not only for Jews. There's wars, different tribes, different beliefs. The hatred, that's what's causing all the problems in the world. So, we must love people around us, not find fault, whether colour, or skin, or different beliefs. Love everybody, be kind to everybody. We should not forget what has happened to us and we must be aware that things, God forbid, could happen again. [family singing and clapping] -[speaking with intense emotion] -[Ella] I was with one foot -[speaking with intense emotion] -[Ella] already over there. I thought it's the end, but I am here, I'm standing here among all of you, can you believe it? Is it true? Confirm it. Tell me, tell me that it's me. I think, still, I'm dreaming. "No, no, it's me", I must tell myself. I don't like to be emotional, I don't want to, I want to be happy and grateful, but what I left behind, it's not here. Every person has a grave to go to, I have none, not even ashes. There's nothing I can do. At least I go to my husband's grave. I am there and I pray to God for, every day, to leave me among all of you. I've lost 23 dear souls. Can you imagine? It's not just words, it's true. Just wiped away. I've got a lovely family that I try to think it's a substitute, it's not a substitute, but they are next to me, and I've got somebody that I love truly and always next to me and they can hear me when I cry and when I laugh. Thank you. [laughter and joy] * calming [Ella] It hasn't been easy, but I feel now that it's off my heart. It's a piece out of me, part of my life, is now with you, so don't forget it. * purposeful [Ella] Be happy. Enjoy every day and see the world around you, that everybody smiles, there should be goodness. Take life and make the best of it! Every day, as I get up, my curtains are always open. I like to see the day, the dawn coming in. I'm ready, every morning, to thank God that He gave me another day of life. * sombre
