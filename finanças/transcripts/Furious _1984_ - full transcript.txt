He's made fools of my men. He must be stopped before he does too much damage. He may ruin my entire operation, if we're not careful. I've trained these men for years, and look what he's doing to them. I can't afford to loose any more fighters. Do you realize what these radicals are costing me? I will not be made a fool of. And there must be an example. Bring me my brave fighters. Ha, ha, ha... "intruder alert!" Ha, ha, ha... Stop him! Cut him off! Grab him! Ha, ha, ha... It's working. Finally working, ha, ha, ha...

He turned evil, efter learning western ways. You know, Capitalism, and... fast food franchises. He even used me to use sorcery to lower his overhead But now he seeks the old power take the task from inside my coat No, not the medalion. The enchanted tusk. It will leave you with forbidden Mongolian caves. There lies the key to the Universe. Good luck, Simon. His powers are unlimited. And the fate of the world is in your hands. Only you can stop him now. For I am no... longer... out of this world... So Master, everything has come full circle. Ha, ha, ha... You see Simon. I had to bet more against mortal to concentrate each medallion with the aura of death. They will be my key, to the Astro plane. The source of ultimate power. And now, you, you too must die. Aaarghhh!!! Ha, ha, ha, ha..... Aaaahhhhh!!!! It's sapping my power. Sapping my power. Ha, ha, ha... Aaaahhhh!!! Come down, for me. Down... Aaahhh. Down...
