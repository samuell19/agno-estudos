[MUSIC - REGGIE PERKINS, "HIGH SCHOOL CAESAR"] Next time he'll pay. Yeah. Come on. Brett? Yes, Matt? This annoys me. You see the way Kelly's poster's up there next to mine? It... it spoils the whole effect. Why don't you just take his down? I can't do that, Matt. You heard him, tear it down. Gonna tear that? All right, now, about this election, you know it's pretty important. You know who to vote for? You, Matt. You, Matt. I'd say that was an extremely intelligent decision. Yeah. Yeah, OK, then take off. Well, come on. You heard him, get going. I sure showed him, didn't I, Matt? Huh? How'd I do? You sure did. May I speak to Mr. Burnett please? Does Matt know about this? Well, just forget about it. It wasn't very important anyhow. Matt? What? You wouldn't have any idea who tore up my poster? What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. Now, look, why would I do something like that? That's something only you know. - Hey, Matt? - Hmm? Who's the chick? Where? There. Don't point, Crickett. Not polite. Oh, I think that's that new girl. Pretty nice, isn't she? She sure is. Listen, fix me up, will you? Huh? Sure. Go on, ask her. Now? Now's as good a time as any. Hi, Bob. Uh, hi, uh, let's see, I was wondering, are you doing anything this afternoon [inaudible] election - going to be there? - Mm-hm. Oh, then that's nice. I thought... [bell ringing] Well, I'll probably see you there. OK. Why didn't you ask her? I don't know. Well, look, maybe she doesn't want to go with me. Well, man, you'll never know if you don't ask. Why don't you watch where you're going? A little clumsy today, aren't you, Lita? Let me help you. Don't pay too much attention to her. She's kind of funny. Funny ha ha or funny strange? Where are you from? Portland. Portland's a nice town. Uh, what's your name? Wanda. Wanda Anderson. Wanda, I'm Matt Stevens and this is Crickett. - Hi. - Hi. If you're ready to go, we'll walk out with you. OK. Excuse me. Yeah. We'll see you later, honey. OK. If you don't get on the ball and move in pretty soon, somebody else will. But what am I going to say to her? Just see if she wants to go to the movies with you tomorrow - night. - Yeah. What do I have to do, ask her for you? No, Kelly, I'll ask her myself. OK. [inaudible] Hey, come on, are you going to vote for me? Well, yeah. I sure don't want to see Matt as student body president. Well, you're not helping the cause any standing here. Now, you listen to me. Now, I have better things to do than put up with your fits of temper. You pull another little stunt like that and then you've had it. You got that? All right. Now then, I want you to line Crickett up with Wanda for tomorrow night. Who? Wanda, the new girl. Tell her we'll meet her at The Wagon at about 8 o'clock. That's what I like about you, honey. You know what you want and how to get it. I'll see you later. Yeah, I'll see you, Lita. [music playing] Hey, what's happening? Girl's time, Robert. You're sure about that? Come on. Well, don't just sit there, ask the girl to dance. You want to dance? Yes, I'd like to, Bob. Honestly, that guy. You're right. Hey, what are you doing? I'm laying them out first. They're easy to see that way. Kelly. GIRL: Matt. Lita, now I'm going in my office to finish up this paperwork. Let me know, please, as soon as the ballots are counted, - will you? - [inaudible] GIRL: Matt. Matt. Kelly. Matt. - How's it going? - Good. Great. Fine. I'll go collect the ballots. Everyone should have voted by now. Kelly. Kelly. Matt. Matt. Hey, what's the big idea? What's wrong? You better keep your mouth shut. [music playing] Hey, Matt, you really think I'll get to be student body treasurer? Yeah, I think so. You'll be even more important to me then. Everything OK, Freddy? Yeah, Dusty. Just fine. We'll be done here in a minute. That's it. Is that all of them? Uh, I wanted to ask, are you doing anything tomorrow night? No. Well, I was just kind of wondering, well, would you go to a movie with me? Yes, Bob. Oh, you would? [inaudible] As the principal of Wilson High School, I'm very happy to be able to announce that you have elected for treasurer Homer David. [crowd mumbling and chattering] Better known to all of you as Crickett. And for student body president, Matthew Stevens. Sorry about the election. That's the way it goes. [music playing] Better luck next time, Kelly. Thanks. [music playing] I sure wish the election hadn't turned out the way it did. I was counting on being right-hand man to the president. That's the way it goes. Hey, you guys all ready for the race this Saturday? Ready and waiting. I guess the only thing Matt hasn't taken over now is our drag races. Are the dangerous? No, not really. We're doing it for the fun of it anyway. I don't know anybody who wants to win bad enough to get themselves killed over it. That's for sure. Do the rest of the fellas know about it? Yeah, Rod and I spread the word this afternoon. Well, make sure the guys keep it quiet. We don't want Stevens horning in. [music playing] [crowd moaning] All right. Excuse the interruption, but I just wanted to thank everyone for placing their confidence in me and electing me the new president of the student body. Now, I just had a meeting with the principal about a little pet project of mine that I've hand in mind for some time, and that was if I was elected. Now, this is it... the dance went over so well today that we're going to do them every Friday starting tomorrow. [crowd talking] However, there will be an admission fee of $0.25. [crowd moaning] Since we're known as the Wilson High School Bulldogs, this admission money will be used for the purchase of a mascot for the school and to help pay for his care. Now, as soon as we've gotten together that money, we have permission to buy a registered bulldog puppy. [crowd cheering] And now, to celebrate my election, Cokes for everybody, it's on me. [crowd cheering] Make another detail. We'll get it all back. You bet, Matt. Gee, I think a school mascot's a great idea. You can bet there's some catch to it if he has anything to do with it. Well, gang, I got to go. I got to cram for an exam tomorrow. If I don't, I'll be a senior the rest of my natural life. You bet, you're not the only one. Let's shag out of here. Can I take you home? Sure. Hey, Kelly. Matt. What's the rush? You got a free Coke waiting for you. Uh, thanks. I can still afford to buy my own. Matt, when you going to fix me up with Wanda? Tomorrow night, buddy boy, tomorrow night. LUCY: Your breakfast is ready, Matthew. Be right down, Lucy. Good morning, Lucy. My goodness, you're in a good mood this morning. Well, why shouldn't I be? I got the best cook in the whole world. Ah, go on and eat your breakfast before it gets cold. All right. And how about some music? All right, what do you want to hear? Well, you know what I like. You pick it out. And send Carter in, will you? Yes, Matthew. You wanted to see me, sir. Is the car ready? Yes, sir. Washed? Yes, sir. I just want to remind you, Carter, that I don't intend to drive the car if I ever find it in the condition it was yesterday. No, sir. I mean, yes, sir. And one more thing, if you can't perform your duties to my satisfaction, then I'll just have to replace you. It won't happen again, sir. Is that all? That's all. Is there something wrong with your breakfast, Matthew? No, really, it's fine, Lucy. I'm just not hungry. Did you, uh, write folks that you was elected president of the student body? Why should I, they don't care. Now, Matthew. Listen, I got to run. You know something, though, Lucy? I've been looking at you and you're getting prettier every day. I just expect to walk in here one day and find that one of your boyfriends has up and carried you off for good. Oh now, you can go on. I'll see you later. It seems like that boy's folks ought to stay home instead of gallivanting all over Europe and places like that. Well, I don't blame him. If I had a brat like that, I'd take off, too. You just don't understand Matthew. Oh, I've got him pegged all right. Hi, Wanda. Hi. I'm Lita, Matt's date. I just wanted to tell you that your Crickett's girl and just to meet us tomorrow at the hangout at 8 o'clock. [inaudible] Hey, what's the big idea? Nobody tells me who I go on a date with. Hi, Matt. Look, knock that off and make it look like a normal conversation and I won't bother you. [inaudible] I didn't have time to study over the weekend. Like I don't have time [inaudible] study or not. Give Crickett $10, tell him exactly what kind of test you want. He'll have it for you Monday. Ten dollars? I didn't think they were that much. Take it or leave it. I don't know whether I can raise up that much money or not. Can I pay you part now and part later? Listen, I'm running a business not a charitable organization. Now, no money, no sale. I'll try to get it, Matt. Make the arrangements with Crickett. OK, Matt. How's the president this morning? Good, Lita. You talk to Wanda yet? What? Did you talk to Wanda yet? Oh, yeah, everything's all set. I just saw her. Everything's all set for tonight. That's my girl. [bell ringing] [music playing] What's the take? Oh, pretty good, Matt. I'd say about $20. Well, that's great. Well, you can take $5. Not now, you idiot. You can take some of the small bills. It'll look funny if the big ones are missing. OK. Be careful, will you? See, I told you, as treasurer of the student body, you're going to be very important to me. Well, I... I thought you had me fixed up with Wanda? Will you not point? And relax, will you? You are fixed up with Wanda. Lita set it up. She's going to meet you at The Wagon at 8:00. Are you sure? I'm sure. Oh, oh, hi Char... Uh, Mr. Burnett. Well, Homer, how's the mascot money coming along? Oh, uh, just fine. I'd say about, uh, $15. I'll count again and make sure. Well, at that rate, it won't take long to buy the dog. Uh, if you see Matthew, Homer, would you have him drop by my office? OK, Mr. Burnett, I'll tell him. Hey, Matt, Matt. Old Chowderhead wants to see you. Oh, all right. Matt, what do you think is wrong? Relax, will you? Nothing. He probably just wants my advice on something. Well, he looked funny. I'll take care of it. Now, you got the money? Yeah. Chowderhead want to see me? Yeah. Oh. Crickett said you wanted to see me. Yes, sit down, will you, Matt. Matthew, there's a potentially serious problem in this school. Students roughed up, school books and personal property damaged, that sort of thing. Have you heard anything about it? Well, sir, not directly. I've heard a couple of the kids talking about it in the hall. But... well, I didn't think it was anything to worry about. I believe it is. As president of the student body, you might be able to help me, Matthew. Well, I certainly will if I can, sir. Somehow, I've got to find out who or what is causing all this, and put a stop to it. The students that I've talked to either can't or... or won't give me any information. Well, sir, just what do you want me to do? As a student, it'd be a lot easier for you to find out just what this is all about than it would be for me. I see. Well, let me check around and, if I hear anything, I'll report right back to you. Thanks, Matt. I knew I could count on you. You certainly can. Is that all, sir? That's all. Can I see it again, Matt? OK. Wow, look at that. It's pretty, isn't it? Seventy-five dollars for one week's pay. I can't believe it. We got a lot of things going for us now. We got the dance on Fridays, we got the protection insurance, and my file of tests. Yeah, boy, you got Old Chowderhead eating right out of your hand. I don't see how you do it. Like this. Hey, listen, you want a couple of bucks for your date, and you can pick up the rest of your 10% at meeting tomorrow night. Could I, Matt? Then I could really show Wanda a good time. Sure. Listen now, how much you going to make this week? Oh, let's see, 10% of 75... I got lost. Seven-fifty. Really? Crickett, you're going to have to learn to use that head of yours, because if you don't, somebody's going to cheat you out of something before you get it figured out. Now, here. Thanks, Matt. Oh, like I promised you, for your date tonight. Well, you didn't think I was going to let you use this one did you? Yeah, I... I did, Matt. Nobody drives dad's car except me. Come on, take the hot rod. OK, Matt. Whatever you say. See you tonight at The Wagon. OK. Lucy? Carter? Lucy? Carter? Lucy, are you here? [music playing] [crying] [music playing] Scoot over. Well, uh, what picture are we going to see? I want to see the one at The Strand. So do I. OK with me. Do you ever get sort of a funny feeling - when you've been double crossed? - Yeah. Yeah. Is something wrong? No. You want to dance? Sure. Hey, you're going to wear her out. Not this kid. Aren't you guys going to dance? No. No. [music playing] Hey, Matt, I thought you had me fixed up with Wanda? That's right, buddy. Well, it sure don't look like it. She's in there with Bob. Well, don't look at me. Come on, we'll see about it. What do you want, Matt. You better take off, sister, your date's waiting for you. She's with her date. Shut up. Now, look... Look yourself, I don't know what goes in this town, but I don't want any part of it. I happen to be with my date, Mr. Stevens. And not you or any of your flunkies are going to tell me what to do. I told Crickett... And I don't take orders from anybody, and especially from a pampered little punk like you. Really? Hey! Knock it off! They'll be no fighting in my place. If you guys got something to settle, settle it outside. OK, big man, let's go. Come on, buddy, let's get out of her. We'll settle it later, Mr. Williams. All right, what are you looking at? Dance. I said dance! Well, I'd better go in. OK. Goodnight, Bob. Well, goodnight. Well, good luck, Rod. Hey, anybody want to bet on a sure winner? - Yeah. - Hey, what's the hot tip? Ah, me. Oh, really, now, Bob. Guys. We'll just wait and see. The guy down at the auto store put a new compression head on, and he said she'll be a sure winner. You know, you're going to spend a fortune on that bomb if you listen to those guys. Well, we'll just wait and see if it's worth it. Hey, where's Bea? She's babysitting. I'm going to pick her up after the races. OK, let's get ready for the first race. [engines revving] - Ready? - Ready. Ready, Rod? I'm ready. OK, let's go. I told you so. Nice going. [crowd congratulating] Thanks a lot, I'm pretty good. Look, there's Stevens. Oh, no. Oh, he would have to come. All right, now. They'll be a $2 entry fee for this next race. Pay Crickett. Just a minute Stevens. Nobody wants you to come out here. We're doing fine all by ourselves. And we're not paying an entry fee to you or anybody else. That's right. [Inaudible]. Yeah. I'm not paying. I didn't think you would. All right, just... just wait a minute now. This is going to be a little different. When there's prize money, you always have an entry fee. Now, I'm putting up this gold coin as first place money. You all have seen it. It's worth $100, probably more. Everybody that wants in on it, line up here and pay Crickett your $2. We can't all run in one race. Why not? 'Cause it's dangerous. Now, let's just run two or three cars at a time, we'll clock out the winner. No, no, no. We'll run them all at once. Now, if you don't have the stomach for it, then you just don't enter. Hey, who's going to hold the prize money? Uh, when I win it, I want to make sure I'm going to get it. I'll hold the money. All right. But I'll be back to pick it up. It's pretty important. My dad gave it to me. Matt, you shouldn't have put up your gold coin. Will you relax. They haven't got a chance against this car. You know that. Now, go collect that money. If you say so. All right, listen. Everybody, up here. Now, this is not going to be a drag race, because the track is too short. We're going to go around three complete times. A road race. You got that? Crickett will start us off. Are you ready? MEN: Yeah. All right, let's go. Hey, how about that, huh? [cheering] Thanks, Stevens. And let me know the next time you got something to give away. MAN: Well, congratulations, Kelly. Way to go. OK, let's knock it off for today. Boy, I wish Bea would've been here to see you. Yeah, me, too. Say, uh, who has the [inaudible] anyway? I don't know. I don't have them. Well, I wonder who had them last. I think they're up at the other end of the strip. I'll get them. Do you need any help? No, I'll pick up Bea and see you guys at the hang out. How about you pull over? Pull over. Knock it off. Pull over, Kelly. Pull over, Robert. Knock it off. He's dead, Crickett. You shouldn't have done it, Matt. - You shouldn't have done it! - What do you mean, me? I didn't do it. You saw, the tire blew. It was an accident. Crickett, look. My dad gave me this coin. It use to be his good luck piece. Boy, it sure didn't help Kelly any, did it? You're not going to take it with you, are you, Matt? Now, you listen to me. Now, we're in this thing together, you understand that? Huh? Now, nobody's going to believe us, so we can't say a word about it. Not one word. Now, we didn't do it. It wasn't fault. You got that? Yeah, yeah, Matt. Sure. Come on. [music playing] - Hi, Bea. - Oh, hi. Hey, where's Kelly? I don't know. - I thought he was with you kids. - No. When he left the races, he said he was going to stop by and pick you up. Oh, he probably had some trouble with that bomb of his. With that car, I wouldn't doubt it. The darn thing is so temperamental. He's probably standing some place with a wrench in his hand, cussing up a storm. Let's go see if we can find him. All right. Carter? Yes, sir? Is there any mail? Yes, sir, your check arrived. It's on the table behind you. Was there anything else? I mean, a letter or something? No, sir, just the check. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Operator. Uh, would you get me the long dis... uh, the overseas operator, please? OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Yes, sir. MAN: I know it. It's Kelly, he's had a wreck. Well, where'd he go? Did he leave a message or something? I've got to talk to dad. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Didn't the check arrive? Yeah, I... I got the money. It's not that. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, Matthew, he's not here. Don't you know when he's coming back or anything? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Well, Mr. Stevens flew to Switzerland yesterday and he didn't say when he'll be back. Yeah, he's always gone. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Shall I have him call you as soon as he returns? No, no. No, that's all right. Just... just forget it. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, Matthew. Yeah, goodbye. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Goodbye. Carter? Carter? Yes, sir? I noticed a couple dents in my hot rod. I want you to take it down and have it fixed. Yes, sir. I'll do it first thing in the morning. Do it right now. Now, sir? I don't understand. Why? You don't have to. Just do it. Yes, sir. All right, what's wrong? Matt? Did you hear about Kelly? Yeah, I heard about it. Funny accident, huh, Matt? Now what's that crack supposed to mean? Gee, I... I thought you were mad about losing the coin at the races. Sure, I was because I thought I could win it back. That doesn't make any difference. I can always buy another one. I got a surprise for you. Lita? [crowd chattering] Future mascot of Wilson Senior High School. Crickett and I got him this afternoon. Have we got the money for him yet? MATT: No, but we will have. I just wanted to show him to my gang early, so don't... don't mention it. I'll introduce him to the student body at the dance on Friday. It's supposed to be a surprise. All right, let's get the meeting started. Now, any of you that want a test or a theme, see me right after the meeting, because from now on, you're welcome to my files for nothing. [chattering] Hey, outsiders still pay $5 to $10. Now, up to this point we've been pretty lenient about these dues, we let them lag a couple of weeks behind. But from now on, they pay on time or we're going to work them over good. [chattering] All right, there's some dancing and refreshments in the next room. Meeting's adjourned. Don, what can I do for you? I need a biology test, too. Is that a new instructor? DON: Yes. When is the test? Monday at 10:30. Hawk, go get Lita. I'll tell you what, Don, go on into the party, and then check with me before you leave tonight. Thanks, man. Hi. Hi. I'd like an English one test, Matt. English one. That's it, isn't it? Thank you. You want to see me, Matt. Yeah, honey, did you run off any new biology tests this week? Yeah, I just finished them yesterday. They're in the storeroom. Thanks. All right, pay day. Thanks, Matt. Thank you, Matt. Here's your cut. And a little something extra. There's something that you're going to have to do. Slick, you and Hawk stick around. You two can go. We need a couple of biology two tests for the files. You want us to get them? Yeah. Now, here's the key for the office. This one is to the building outside, and this one to the storeroom. OK, Matt, we'll be right back. Save some food for us. Be careful now. OK. Hawk. Leave everything just like it was. Look, you don't have to worry about a thing. How's it going, buddy? Oh, OK, man. Here's the rest of your cut of this week's take. Thanks. You'll be happy to know I upped you from 10 to 15% a week. Really? Now you're going to have to work on figuring 15% in your head. I haven't even got 10% yet. Come on, let's go inside. Over here. And here they are. MAN: Take a couple out of the middle. They always write something on the ones on top. OK. I got them. Let's get out of here. Hurry it up. Listen. I am. It's stuck. Stand back. Hello, Wanda. Hi. Listen, Matt rented the hangout tonight. Well, we're going to plan to throw a party to celebrate his birthday. Well, I just want to tell you that you're going with me and... and I'll pick you up at 7:30 sharp. Well, who do you think you are? You just don't tell a girl she's got a date with you. Yeah, but I thought... Forget it. I'm not interested. Hi, Matt. Hey, Matt. I thought you told me you didn't have any trouble Saturday. That's right, Matt. We made a clean getaway. - Really? - Yeah. Well, I just left the principal's office and somebody saw you. Well, yeah, but he didn't get close enough to see who we were. We didn't think it mattered since he didn't recognize us. Didn't matter? You stupid idiots. Don't you realize that after you broke that window, they checked everything. They're going to change every lock, every test in this building. Gee, Matt, we're sorry. You're sorry? Do you have any idea how long it took me to get those keys and those tests? Do you think he's got the real coin? I don't know who else has it. Well, we've got to do something. What? Matt's too well organized. Maybe not. What have you got in mind? Well, alone we don't stand a chance. If we stick together, maybe we can do something. It might work. At least we would have a better chance of proving Matt was the guy responsible. Let's pass the word around to the kids we know we can trust. Meet tonight at my house at about, uh, 8 o'clock. OK. I don't think I'll come, Bob. I'd sure like to have you there, Bea. I'll come by your place and we'll walk over together, OK? BEA: OK. All right, fine. We'll see you guys later. I got a committee meeting. Wanda. What do you want? You know, you kind of hurt Crickett's feelings when you turned him down. I really don't care. Besides, he didn't ask me, he told me. Well, if you're not interested in going with Crickett to the party, then why don't you go with me. Is this a trick so I'll end up as Crickett's date? No, I just want you to go with me, that's all. Well, what about Lita? Give her to Crickett. Oh. Well, what kind of presents do you like? Wanda, you don't have to bring a gift. Let's just say that you'll be my present. I'm really not interested. As far as I'm concerned, you're even more repulsive than Crickett is. Did you have any luck? No. Well, a bunch of kids are getting together over at Bob's place tonight. She's probably going over there. Matt, this is the one that could be my girl. How... how come she isn't? Look, forget it, will you? Yeah, but you're such a big man. Why can't you set it up like you said you would? OK. You got it. Tonight. Really? Really. Come on. Hey, can I give you a lift? Oh, that won't be necessary. I'm not going very far. Come on, I just want to give you a ride. Just leave me alone. I wouldn't think of letting such a pretty girl walk. Now, you get in. Let's get going, Crickett. Look, just settle down, huh. It's just that when I offer a girl a ride, I like to have her accept, that's all. Where to, Matt? I don't care where you're going, but I'm going to Bea Johnson's. Really? Are you? Let's go some place nice and quiet, like the Lakewood Park. Road. Crickett. [chattering] [knock on door] Come on in, Bea. Where's Wanda? Well, I don't know. I called her at home, but she didn't answer. Huh? I probably just missed her. Yeah, probably. Well, we'll start the meeting in a minute anyway. All right, now we've had a nice little drive. Come on, please take me home. But, baby, we just got here. Oh, take your hands off me. Fight. I like that. Leave her alone, Matt. Look, you mind your own business, will you? Yeah, but she's supposed to be my girl. Oh, really? Well, I just changed my mind. CRICKETT: Yeah, but, Matt, you got Lita. No, you got Lita. From now on, this is my dish here. But, Matt, we're supposed to be buddies. Look, stupid, leave us alone, will you. Yeah, but, Matt, you promised me that... Get out of here. We want to be alone. Can't you understand that? Oh. Matt, you said that we were... Get out of here. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. All right. Let's have a little mood music, huh? You... you killed Kelly. Hey, look, come on. Are you kidding? I got a whole stack of coins at home. It doesn't mean anything. Wanda? Hey, where are you? Hey, come on back. [music playing] Listen to me! Somebody listen to me! Somebody listen to me! You got to listen to me! It's about Kelly! MAN: What about Kelly? MAN 2: Yeah, what about him? MAN 3: Yeah, what about him? MAN 4: What happened? It wasn't an accident. Matt did it. It was all Matt's fault. Honestly, look, I'm telling the truth. You got to believe me. Pete, wasn't I with Matt at the races? Didn't I go home with him? Yeah. That's right. He did want to get that coin back. After the races, we didn't go home. We parked. And we waited. We waited for Kelly. Matt chased him. He ran him off the road. Now, if we all stick together, we can get the proof. Look! What happened? Where is everybody? I wouldn't know, Matt. But they... they're supposed to be here. It's a party. It's my birthday party. [crash] Operator. Give me the police. Now, what'd you do this for? Hey, where is everybody? Hey, Slick, hey, Slick, Gussy, come on. I... I got a job for you. Just like old times. Hey, come on. Where is everybody? I don't need you. I don't need any of you. I never did need you. You needed me. I could always get along without anybody. Without anybody. Without anybody. Bob, what happened? Where is everybody? Now, listen, look Bob, it was an accident, I swear. I swear it was an accident. I just waited for him, to talk to him, to try to get the coin back. I really didn't mean to try... Bob, please help me. Please help me. I'm going to. Bob. Hey, Crickett, tell them it wasn't my fault. Crickett? What'd you do, Crickett? Crickett! [crying] Dad? Dad? Don't go. [music playing]
