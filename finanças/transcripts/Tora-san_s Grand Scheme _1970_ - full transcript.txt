A Shochiku film Plum blossom lime. And the sound of a stream tells us spring is near. We, of our world, travel without overcoats. That looks better, we think. But in our hearts, like birds waiting for spring... We, too, long for the season of a warm sun. Granny! Granny, mail! Where from? Yoshio in Nagoya. I'm sorry but will you read it for me? I broke my glasses. Too bad. All right, I will. "Dear grandmother: Are you well? I'm well, too, and working. "Time flies. I've been working here for a year. "I've saved a little money. "So I'm sending the electric foot-warmer you wanted. "Ask mother how to use it. "Don't burn yourself and take good care of it. "My regards to Yoshiko and Sumiko." You're lucky! A fine grandson! Thank you. Then... At home, my sister, uncle and aunt are worrying about me. Every year when spring draws near, I'd like to buy warm coats and go home to make them happy but its easier said than done. My bus is coming. Thanks for the food. I'll leave the money here. Keep the change. Use it to pay for the foot-warmer electricity. It's... No, keep it. Mister... The cakes and drink... 120 yen. 20 yen more? Not enough? Thought it's enough. Small coins only... Thank you. To tell the truth, if only I had money... I'd like to buy gifts and go home right away granny, best of luck for the rest of your life. My best to your grandson. Be strong and happy! 80 will I! Good luck! Goodbye! Bye! Granny, take care! Bye. Goodbye. Yes, my home is in Shibamata, Katsushika, Tokyo. Tora-San's grand scheme executive producer: Tsuguo Saito I was born and raised in shibamata, katsushika. Kuruma is my family name. And my given name is Torajiro.

I'd like to go abroad before I die. But I can't pay 300,000 yen, even if it's a special rate. He won't take me to Oshima, let alone Hawaii. Stingy. Anyone here who wants to go? Can't, Noboru. Next year. He's in charge of shops then. Next year? A long time to go. Not this year? We went to Shuzenji. How about Nikko in Autumn? Maples then. Listen, Noboru. A good salesman now. Don't tease me. I'll leave this poster. Put it up. Come again. He's reformed. He's different from Tora. He's different, Tora. Not Tora, Mitsuo. A mistake again. Mitsuo's handsomer. Let's go to dad. What's, Tora, the fool, doing? You're back? How was your trip? Was I surprised! Why? I saw Tora. Tora? Where was he? In Nagoya! Give me some water. What was the fool doing? Selling stuff? No, no! He was at the races. Race tracks? Hi, Tora! Don't bother me. Be quiet. Please. What's that? He asked a horse. Asked what? Asked if it can come in first. What? Are you joking? No. He was serious. "Even worms have souls. "So a horse knows how I feel," he said. He's a fool, really! A fast horse? A hopeless one. Name's wagon—tiger. Fifty years old if it was a man. It'd never come in anywhere near first. What? An old horse? Don't you dare slam wagon—tiger. See? What does wagon-tiger mean in Japanese? Wagon is kuruma. Tiger is Tora. Same as my name. Same name. I feel we're related. That's ridiculous! How could that be? Fool! Red blood runs in him like us. If a poor man bets all on him, he'd know. I doubt it. Don't trust wagon—tiger? He answered what I said. Answered? Of course! Horses don't lie. I looked at him a long time. He gave me a big nod with round eyes. He's a fool. How stupid can he get? He lost? No. You'd be surprised! Tora, you hit the jackpot! Hey, Tora! Hey, brace up! Wagon—tiger really won! Of course he did! It came to 18,000 yen. But it was a special ticket, so he won 180,000 yen. 180,000?! What did he do with it? My lucky day. I have to follow up my luck. It's our way. Hey, wait! Stop it! Go home to shibamata with the money. It's my money. I'll do as I like with it! Go on home! Tora! Bye, octopus! Half—crazy. No use trying to stop him. Then Tora... It's plain. He lost it. Three races after that. He lost it all in one race? He's really a fool! It's the end. Men going to races! No medicine can cure them! I'll say! And... why did you go? That's it. I plumb forgot. I must go home. He lost 180,000 yen, I guess. That makes me sick. I've got a headache. The same old gen! You dim—wit! Buddy! Where were you? Nagoya. I came from there by taxi! Nagoya! It's a Nagoya cab! My buddy's back! It's a Nagoya cab! Hey, Horaiya! Still a moron? Tora! Are you back from Nagoya? Buddy's back! He took a taxi from Nagoya! Hey, it's terrific! Tora's back! It's no time to sleep. Tora's back from Nagoya! Hit it big at the races! Here he comes! A crummy old place every time I come. Buddy. The driver says to pay him. How much? 29,000 yen. Taxi fare's cheap. Pay him. Keep your cool! Here, driver. Hi, aunty. You well? You're well, too, uncle? Fine, fine. Listen. How much did you win? Not much. Just think I was lucky. 100,000 yen? 200,000 yen? More? I always come back empty-handed. Think it's enough to take my old relatives somewhere on a pleasure trip. Say, it's wonderful! Where? Atami? Yugawara? How about Beppu or Unzen? Tora. Beppu? Not a bad idea. You two want to go? For 1 or 6 months? Wait! Are you in your right mind? Of course. Do you want to go farther? Why not let him take you to Hawaii? Can you go on a million yen? Three or four could go easy. Hawaii's fine. Fine as a cat with its fur full of catnip. Let's go, uncle and aunty. Done! What's the matter? It's... how much did you win? Want to know? We do. Alright, I'll show you. Always near me... It's somewhere. Buddy. Idiot! How come you got it? But, you... Scared stiff! You see, I want to repay uncle and aunty, my blood relatives. Praying to the gods and Buddha, I bet on 5, 6 and 7 and won and won. Don't become dizzy. Steady, aunty. It's one million yen. It's true! Gen! Close the store! My treat. Let's celebrate and have a good time. Closed for today I feel I'm having a nightmare. Winning so much made him funny in the head? Weak in the first place. One million? Hit it big? I'm glad for him! But it's made my factory boys lose the will to work. Honest work's silly. I worked, sent my boy to college. But he still drains me... No Hawaii for me. It's the talk of the town. I'm congratulated and asked when we'll go. I'm hard put to answer. Uncle? He's in bed with a temperature. Brother? What's he doing? Went to buy air tickets? Can't buy them at the station. What? Noboru's card? He went to noboru's office? First trip abroad. I'm counting on you. Isn't it nice? How did you get it? Not at the races? Joking? That's for poor people! I'm a traveling salesman. I didn't know Noboru knew such a fine man. He'll reduce the price. I see. Please help me. Noboru, pay up. The money paid won't return. It's best to get into the mood and not worry. Uncle and aunty...? They say they're desperate but seem happy. Going shopping tomorrow. I see. I don't wonder. Hawaii? I'm going! High priest! Good morning. Good morning. Nice of you, so early. Thank you for coming to see us off. Congratulations. A nice day. A little send-off gift and a charm for a safe journey. Not much. Put it in your bag. You shouldn't, but thank you very much. Hiroshi, this is from him. Look. Wearing sandals to Hawaii? These? We just had a good laugh over them. Our footwear from olden times. I'd wear them to Paris and London. Don't do anything to shame us Japanese. You've got me there! Uncle! Aunty! The high priest's here! Coming! Just like the premier and his wife! No... thanks, everyone. It's good of you, so early. Can you speak English now? No, no! I'm not going to open my mouth over there! All you need to know is, "where is the toilet?" Me, "give me whisky." Sure. And you? That's plain. "I love you." Take care. I wanted to go once myself. Enjoy my share too. Yes, yes. It's about time. Gen. The cab. It's here! Okay? Acting like you're on stilts. My bag. Buddy. When did you come? What the... What's up? Your boss is at the airport? It's... Something's wrong? What? I can't apologize enough! My boss skipped with your money! Skipped? He disappeared yesterday. I phoned the airlines. He didn't pay them! What'll I do? I'm sorry! I didn't know he was that bad. Ass! Tora, the cab's waiting! I see. Coming. What'll you do? Do? You tell me! You fool! All set. They're waiting. What's wrong with him? He's crying because he'll miss me, the big crybaby. I see. I'll go to the airport with you. You're coming? Can't I? It's okay. Thanks. Don't cry. I won't be gone long. Sakura, look after the shop. Don't worry. Sorry to make you wait. Hurry! Take care. I'm sorry I made you wait. Thank you for coming to see us off. The three of us are off to Hawaii. Brother. Take good care of them. Sure. Trust me. Look... three cheers for them. Yes! Three cheers for the Toraya members! Banzai Tell them, "they went safely." "They sent their best regards to you." After that? I'll manage. Go on home. I see. I'll go home. Tora, what'll we do? It's cold. I'll catch cold! Don't say that! I'm thinking. Calm down. Enjoy the scenery. Isn't it a great airport? Uncle! Don't overdo it! No one saw us? Safe, I think. Tsune, the light. No, aunty! Don't switch it on! Why? Why? Supposed to be away, aren't we? I see. Can't even have lights. Tora, what about food? Food? You've got rice? A little but nothing else. Sprinkle salt on the rice. It's me, hiroshi. You're back? No one saw you? Quiet. I'm sorry. Hiroshi. Does Sakura know? Not yet. I was worried and came over. Good. I'm counting on you. Don't tell Sakura. Let's fool friends first to fool the enemy. What'll you do? It's simple. We'll hide for 4 days. On the 5th day, we'll buy pineapples. And say we've just returned. What if they ask about Hawaii? Nothing to it. The water didn't agree with us. Loose tummy, so we couldn't go out at all. Will it work? You got doubts, too? I'm not sure, either. Don't complain! Take a leak first and turn in. It's crushed. Closed temporarily sunning themselves on a Hawaiian beach? Isn't it night over there? Hula dancing with girls under palm trees? I think it's still early morning over there. Then they're drinking morning coffee in a double bed? Keep in line. Thanks. Going home? Yes. Goodbye. Who is she? The new kindergarten teacher. She's beautiful! Isn't she? No sound... doesn't make sense. Like in war days. What did you tell Sakura? That I was calling on a friend. But I can't say it every day. Don't get in bad with her. I must be going. Sorry to bother you. I'll bring some food again tomorrow. What is it? Be quiet! Turn off the light, aunty. The light! You big thief! Tie him up! Aunty, light! A fox face! Stop it! Only cowards hit non—resisting men! Take it easy! Are you really a thief? What do you mean? You're a burglar! Tora, call the police! That's best! Wait! Please spare me! Forgive me! I won't do it again. Don't report me. I have a sick wife and two kids. Pipe down. Think you can fool us with lies? Hold him while I phone the police. What number is the police? It's 110. Okay. Wait! What? If you phone the police, they'll know we're here. Remember that. Never mind. Hurry! Yes, yes! No. We can't do that! I see. A pretty pickle. Why did you break in now of all times? It hurts! Why hit me? What did I do? A thief, aren't you? Don't get smart! Murderer! It hurts. You bit me. Brother! We have no choice. Let's report it. Report it? All our efforts would be for nothing. Tora, we can't keep it up. I'm exhausted. I see. Want everybody to laugh at you? I give up. Yes! Hiroshi, call the police. Wait! Wait, you hear! I said wait! You say you don't mind being laughed at. Know who they'll really laugh at? They'll sympathize with you. But I'll become the laughing stock. You get it? Right, hiroshi? What'll we do? Turn him loose! Let him go? Is that all right? He may steal again. Don't blame me. He won't come here, that's a fact. Hey, I'll release you. Thank me. Beat it! You're an eyesore. Now get lost! Hey, the door's... You louse! Any complaints? I'll go or stay as I please. What? Before I did anything, you tied me up, kicked and beat me. You can't just set me loose. I'll wait for the first train. Jail is better than being chased out. On such a cold night. Taking advantage of us? Only if I can! You're a bad one. Being good doesn't pay. How much? How much do you want? Idiot! Sandals, please. You should've said so sooner. Right? Big head! Hurry up! Get out! Making trouble for us! Brother! Why did you pay him? He's right. No need to pay a thief. That's true. Stop griping! I'm the one who suffers. The lose. What're you doing? Hold it! Hey! Thief! Why did he run away? I'm sorry! I've done nothing! Why did you run, then? It's... I don't know why myself. It's strange! Enough! I saw the money! Toraya gave it to me. Don't lie! They're away. No. They're home. Stupid! The Toraya people are in Hawaii! But I saw four people. No mistake. Throw him in jail, officer! It's true! I saw them. Four people. An elderly couple, one young man... And... a square-faced man with small eyes. Stupid-looking? Yes, yes. It's Tora! Yes! They called him Tora! Toraya! Anybody in? You inside! Open up! Open up! The light. Toraya! Well, well, everyone. Working late at night. Wait. Didn't you go to Hawaii? Well, this and that happened... Wasn't I right? Four people. I never lie. Liars become thieves. Thanks a while ago. Well, well. We're really indebted to you. Not at all. Because you broke in, we're in trouble... It hurts! Thief! Thief? How dare you call me that? Calm down! Explain! What's that? What did you say? No use talking now. It's the thief's fault. I'll beat the stuffing out of him! Okay? We'd have been found out anyway. What's that? Yes! It's hard to keep up a lie! You complaining about what I did? That travel agency used it all! Forget it. Why didn't you say so when he ran away with the money? How could I in my position? You wouldn't, either! Joking? I'd be honest! You couldn't! Stupid! Stop it! It's almost dawn. It was reckless wanting to go to Hawaii. We should've been satisfied with Atami. Yes! I was against it. Me too! How can you say that, uncle? You were... So happy studying English and buying aloha shirts! It was to save your face! I didn't want to! Hang it all! What should I have done then? Was winning a million yen my fault? In all honesty, yes! III got, ill spent! It's humiliating! Humiliating? I like that! How can you say that? I wanted to be good to you, so I even asked a horse. That's the problem. They didn't expect that trip. If you feel like that, find a bride, settle down and don't bother others. That's the best way to repay them. What? You treating me like a kid? Worse than a kid! That does it! Brother! For your sake, I prayed to the gods and gave up sake to bet big. What was wrong in winning? I don't want gambling money! Damn you! Stop it! Don't stop me! Please stop! Darn it! Since yesterday, I'm the one who's suffered the most. Dammit! Satisfied if I apologize? I'm sorry. I'll never darken your doorway again! Brother! Brother! Don't stop me. Hat! What? Listen... Shouldn't we...? It was a bad dream. If we don't think so, it leaves a bitter aftertaste. You've got more grey hair. No wonder. I get more every time Tora comes home. He's a problem. He shouldn't have played the horses. He asked the horse? Yes. It makes me laugh. He said the horse answered him and came in first. He's a funny one, your brother. What's the matter? I feel sorry for him. One month later you're back? It gets warmer with each rain. Spring, pretty soon. What's Tora doing? Tora? He can't come home for a while, that fool. Hi! Listen, listen. Tora's back! What, Tora? Where? I don't see him. See? See? What's he up to? Hard to come in? He can't while we're watching. He's welcome to come in. Call him? He's wet, poor thing. No, wait. It's awkward. Pretend we don't know. He'll come if we don't look. Tomo, go away. Hurry. It seems silly. Coming? Not yet. Coming? Not yet. He's coming. Aunty, it's me, Torajiro. It's been a long time. Tora! You surprised me. When did you come in? I didn't know. Listen, it's Tora! What, Tora? Well, Tora! Welcome home. Uncle, aunty. You've become much older since I last saw you. Silly. Only a month ago. I see. I couldn't take you to Hawaii and made you a lot of trouble. Never mind, it's over. I'm sorry. It's all right. You're wet. Change in back. Thanks. I'm telling you. I can't stay long this time. Don't say that. I know. I'll sleep upstairs till evening. My clothes will dry by then. Wake me at 6. A long trip, so I'm worn out. Say, Tora. A problem. What is? You can sleep downstairs, too. Any reason you don't want me to go up? It's... What is it? Speak up. Truth is, we've rented that room to someone. What? Rented it out? I see. My room's gone? The high priest asked us. We couldn't refuse. Try to understand. I should have known it. Away on a long trip, I'd think of home when I had a rough time. There is a place to return to and people to welcome me warmly. It bolstered my spirit. I see. I have no place to come home to anymore? You're exaggerating! There's room to sleep downstairs! Don't stop me. I'm going out into the rain. Tell Sakura, "hello," for me. Say her brother has no home, so he went out sadly in the rain. Tora, that's cruel. You're back? I'm home. He's Torajiro, our nephew, we told you about. I'm Haruko Usami. I'm renting your room? You're back now. I'm so sorry. I've inconvenienced you? I'm sorry. No, no. It's true. Aunty, aunty. What's up? What're you doing? No will to work? We're having tea. Bring some cake. Not your sweets. All my aunty thinks of, is his own sweets. Dumpy, like her nose. I want no part of it. Are you going out? Yes. I'll be back by evening. See you later. Aunty, nail! Going out already? Yes. Goodbye. Hold it. Wait. I'll see you off. Be careful on the way. A lot of bad guys in this world. Yes. Goodbye! See her? Too bad. Went out. What the... What're you doing? Doing? Can't you see, dummy? So you can't see! Gen, hold it tight! Can't see a thing! Shutting out the sunshine! Unconstitutional! How about it? You won't, even if I ask you? Diabetes isn't fatal in itself. But it's dangerous when complications set in. So I can't be optimistic. If your father... Doctor. I wouldn't like you to call him my father. You two may be old friends. But he's a stranger to me. I don't even remember his face. Nevertheless, he's still your father. Won't you see him? He misses you so much. If he dies like this... Excuse me. Good night. A real treat today, isn't it? Yes, a treat's nice, sometimes. Such measly conversation. That's why poor people make me sad. Can you call this cooking? Don't eat it, then! Rice, please. Miss Haruko! Join us! It looks good. A treat, isn't it? Yes... always a good cook, weren't you, aunty? My rent for this month. Thank you. What're you doing? Of all the surprises and then some. I'll be damned. Are you charging her rent? Naturally. He's made it very cheap. I see. Please don't butt in. How can you charge her? You lack common sense. Or are you that greedy, uncle? Greedy? No, I'm not. It's such a dirty room like a catchall. Only I'd stay in it for free. She's not a relative. Thank her, uncle, and pay her for staying. Isn't that common sense? Doesn't make sense! We can't accept this. Please put it away. - I can't... - Never mind. Good evening! Can we talk? What? We're eating. We'll talk. Come out in back. Wait, octopus. We're eating squid. He wants me. Excuse me. This. I see. Thank you. Anyway, we have our rights! Rights, blights, or whatever! Move to a bigger place if you have any gripes about what I did! That does it! Okay, let's step out! What? The police? You making something out of it? Fine! As an octopus full of fur and black ink! What? Want to fight? Torajiro! Yes? If... it's about my room, please don't fight. I don't mind at all. No, we're not fighting. We like kidding one another. We're great pals. Aren't we? You like to joke. You're fun, president. Octopus... fly up like a kite. Let's go and eat. Let's go. I'm going. Goodbye. Be careful. Where are you going so early? You won't charge miss Haruko while I'm out, will you? Okay then. I'm going. Nonsense! He never has paid rent for his room. Hey, he said, "I'm going," didn't he? Where's that fool off to? Good morning. Say "good morning" to Mr. Director. Good morning! Good morning. Tora, where are you going? That way. No. No outsiders. I want to. Teacher! Tora! I was surprised. I asked, "what're you doing?" "See for yourself. Playing," he said. He was dancing "the Killifish school." Then he went inside, saying it was time for songs. I'm shocked. "Spring has come, spring has come. "Where has it come?" Is supper ready? I missed lunch. I'm hungry. "Spring has come, spring has come. "Where has it come?" Spring? He's got spring fever! Phone, miss Usami. Hello, Haruko? Yoshida here. The truth is... it was very sudden. Your father passed away a little ago. I see. Thank you for telling me. I'll let you know about the funeral. Don't lose heart and pray for his repose. He made up for what he did. He made amends fully. Yes. Going home? I'll go, too. You look pale. Something wrong? Not especially. It's the day Tora's father died. So I'll read the Sutra. Tora's father? Is that right? Tora's father fooled around a lot. He gave his family a hard time. And Tora was born outside the family. An illegitimate son, really. He had a sad childhood. Look, the high priest is dating the teacher. Is that true? Yes, together. Real chummy. That rascal, at his age! A long—time widower. Stop it, fool! Well, well. Welcome. Hello. Having a date with the teacher? Come to eat sweets? A fast worker. Fool! It's the day your father died. Uncle, is it true? Yes. I plumb forgot. I'll go on up. I'm sorry! We'll get it ready. Listen, is Tora's father your brother? Yes. I'm ashamed of myself. I can't open the family shrine! Making trouble. I'll do it. Bring the cushions. Thank you. Rat! Scared me! I thought I heard noises. It was that! Ryuzo, you're not devout enough. I'm very sorry. Uncle, how could you forget your own brother? I'm sorry. So busy, I... Just so you know. What? It's your own father! So it seems. In your place, I always... That's enough! Candles. Bring matches. Hiding money here! Give it back. It's mine! Be quiet! I knew money was short. But so much! That's enough! Tora! What's so funny? Whose Memorial Day is it? My father's, sir. Tora! We must think of a way to comfort the teacher. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Men can drink or gamble when they feel miserable. But what can young girls do? Let's see. If it was me... Yes. You? I'd take her to a pretty lake with a nice view and go boating. Pretty lake? Boat? Pleasant music's nice. Pleasant music? I'll send her a sad novel if she can't sleep at night. That's about it. I see. A boat on a lake, beautiful music and a sad novel... "Love is for us two. "Flowers are for us two. "In love we are two. "Dreams are for us two. "The world is there for us two. "The world is there for us two." We 're hungry. Feed us. Listen, uncle... Know any sad, romantic books? What? A romance? I see. I asked the wrong person? You wouldn't read any. Fool. I used to read novels when I was young and cry over them. Is there a sad one like that? You bet. Just remembering brings tears. What novel? "The lineage." What's it about? Want to hear it? To Mr. Takao Aizawa excuse me. Come downstairs! What? It's so funny! Come down! "Think of me as Chikara Hayase, and do as you like. "You need no gods or Buddha! Just call his name! "Call me Hayase and embrace me, Otsuta! Hayase has come!" Otsuta can't see. Her mind wanders. Holding his lapel with a thin hand, she says... "I'm in pain. Give me my medicine from your mouth." And then? The great scholar put the medicine in his mouth. And then gave it to her. Otsuta lies on her back. This is the best part! "Mr. Hayase... "Your great mentor said I can see you. "I'm so happy." Even the great man cannot keep back the tears. Don't make me cry. It's so sad! I bet Mr. Hayase cried, too. Forgive me for laughing. I couldn't... I'm really sorry. She laughed. For the first time in years! Hey, you working men! My treat tonight! Let's drink. Follow me! As there's an orbit in heaven, we have our fate. Keep year-of-the-sheep girls off corners, or they can't marry. Right? Don't laugh. Watching me with open mouths means you have no beaus. Listen to me. No one can forecast his fate. When I finish, you'll head for home. That handsome man you meet may be your future husband. Can't tell by looks. A man no girl would look at twice goes home. He opens the door. And a dream girl may be waiting to welcome him home. Yes. It can happen. Big news! Big news! What is it? Shouting. Teacher's boyfriend is here! What? Her boyfriend? Be sure first. Not a mistake? No, it's not! They're coming here! Here they are! I'm back. Welcome back. Mr. Aizawa. Please. How do you do? Welcome. Mr. Aizawa, my friend. The owner of the shop. She's very kind. Pleased to meet you. Pleased I'm sure. She's nice to us. My room? It's untidy. Please, please! I'll bring you tea later. Please don't bother. Excuse me. Listen! I saw him. Like I imagined. A fine man. What'll we do? Do? It's... I'm glad. Why? You seem cheerful. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps, I've become docile. Horaiya, you still a fool? What if Tora comes back now? Awful! Tora may be back soon. What'll we do? Gen, you watch there! I hope they leave first! He's coming! Hiroshi, don't let Tora in! But... I knew it'd come to this! Hide his shoes! His shoes! Hurry! Workers of small business, a modest break? Haruko...? She's back! Tora, we'll talk. Brother. For teacher. Later. Don't blame me. Where to? Outside. No! Don't run away. Where? Time to work. No, stay. Don't run away. You wanted to talk to me? I'm sorry. Hey, stay with me. Hey... A guest? Yes. Came a while ago. I see. That's fine. Hey, break time's over! Tora, I heard from my boys. You're pretty chummy with teacher? You rowed on a lake with her the other day? You lady—killer! Idiot! Boss, don't get angry. There's a reason! Hey, Tora. Tora! It hurts. What happened anyway? Thank you for this. Isn't Tora back? He's drinking somewhere, I guess. Don't worry. Please don't worry. It often happens. Is that so? A different sort of doll. Good night. I'm still worried. Will he rant and rave when he gets back? I wonder. You'd better be prepared to be hit. Go over to Sakura's apartment? Too late. It's him. Hurry, the light! Pretend to be asleep. What's he doing? Oh, my... you're awfully old. Uncle. Aunty. As usual, I've become the laughing stock again. I'm going on a trip. Look. I couldn't do anything... To make it up to you this time, either. But some day... I promise to give you a good time. So forgive me. Take good care of yourselves. Be happy and live a long time. My regards to teacher. He left? Looks like it. He left? Well, well. Made me sweat. I was scared when he opened the screens. What're you saying? I was so sorry for him I almost cried. Maybe we should have stopped him! Maybe so. But it'd be awkward for him to find out we were awake. That's it. I thought about that, too. Should we let him go? Yes. But it'd be painful for him... To stay and see teacher every day. Did he really love her? Of course! He's really a fool! Was he still here? Why does he always go overboard... When he knows he won't get anywhere? Was she so beautiful? I'll say she was. Like a Jewel in a trash dump. Wasn't she? You fell for her yourself. Jealous? At your age? No way! Just look at your face. Right! I know my looks and I give up. Tora's a fool about that. Men aren't much different. Have some. What is it? It's my fault. Because I worked there... Buddy... because of me, he... Don't cry. It wasn't all your fault. No. Tora doesn't mind, either. Not knowing we are watching... The thief steals in, humming a song. Then he sees a stove burning in an empty room. He sure is a scatterbrain. He's been out in the cold north wind. So he moves over to the stove to warm himself. "It's warm," he says. Then it strikes him. Why is it burning in an empty house? He tries to run, but quickly I grab him and hit him! A thief without any guts. He pleads for his life. "What? Police for you!!" But when I dial the police, my brother asks me to wait. "If we phone, they'll find out we are hiding." That puts me in a jam! I have no choice but to... Give him 10,000 yen and ask him to leave... The end
