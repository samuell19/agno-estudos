(gentle music) (hooves clattering) - Hannah, the moon is so bright tonight. - [Both] And this cold forest feels as far from you - [Man] As I could be but knowing you'll be seeing the same moon in just a few hours, the world seems small again. I have some incredible news, by the time you receive this I'll be somewhere mid Atlantic steaming towards you at 20 knots. I wanna marry you the minute I'm home. - [Both] Until then I'm jealous of the moon. - Mary! Mary! He's coming home! Hank's coming home! (gentle music) Mom those are your good pearls. - Oh they're perfect for the bodice. Now one more time, - We've already done this. - Measure twice, cut once. (gentle music) Okay, now don't open them until I tell you. Woody. - What do you think Daddy? - Excuse me. - Daddy? - Let him go, he'll be fine. (engine rumbles) - Oh my God it's Hank. Hank! - Captain Jeffries ma'am. Are you Hannah Pinkum? - Mary get your father. (dramatic music) (tearing) (crying) (dramatic music) - I wanna read something that I wrote for Hank. - [Mary] Okay. - Before you I never dreamed that stars could rise under my feet, that eyes could sing, that we could go quietly about flinging open windows though death itself had locked the door. One day may this dress be worn by someone who's found the kind of love where nothing is impossible. (gentle music) (clattering) - Iris, oh there's my girl. Hello, hi gorgeous. Come on, help me get this all set up okay? Want some water? Travis, yes Travis is coming. Come on we don't have much time. Okay Iris no wagging, no slurping, and no being a dog. Oh Iris, how do I look? (footsteps) - Where is she? Where is my girl? Hey sweetheart, come here. You got fat, you got bathed. You didn't miss me at all. Hey you. - Hey. Hi. - The place looks incredible. - You know me, I'm a fixer. - Zoey, Zoey do I wish you had been with me in New York. You know me and organization. You are my right hand, my left brain, my north pole and my south paw. - So besides being miserable without me did you manage to have fun and get famous? - Got a show at the Bierman Gallery this June and photographs by Travis Cleveland at the Sinclair Studio in September. - Are you serious? - Yeah! - So does this mean I should save your grocery lists and make you sign my t-shirts? - Zoey you're not gonna believe this, I met the woman of my dreams. You never thought I'd get married did ya? - No, no I did. - [Travis] Well you're right. It was fate, I met her at the Wheeler opening, she's one of his models. - A model. - Yeah, yeah but I really think you'll like her. She's smart and she's sensitive and funny and-- - And beautiful. - I'm a goner. Oh hey would you get us a couple cappuccinos. Cass should be here any minute. And Cass said that she likes hers with extra foam. (tapping) - Hey. - [Vendor] Hey. - One with sugar, one without and one with extra foam. - [Vendor] You got it. - And ground glass. (door bangs) - Red hot cappuccinos for the red hot lovers. - Cass come meet Zoey. Zoey I want you to meet my bride to be. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. (dog barks) - Iris, Iris. What's gotten into you. - Cass I recognize you from magazines. - Oh which magazine? - Ah let's see maybe Biker Mama's or Roughage and You. (laughs) - She's funny Travis, no wonder you like her. - I'm nothing without Zoey, I'm nuts and she's the bolts. (growls) Iris stop that! - Is that your dog Zoey. - No she's mine. Whenever I'm out of town like this she, you know, wants my undivided attention. - Well who can blame her? (growls) (barks) - Iris stop! - Yikes. So Zoey do you have a boyfriend? - Ah, yeah until recently. - Oh well maybe you'll meet someone at our wedding. Wouldn't that be perfect? Travis look, this was my absolute dream dress. And it costs an absolute fortune. - Yeah, it's interesting. What do you think Zoey? - It kinda looks like a futuristic nurse uniform. - Excuse me? Do you realize who designed this dress? Wilhelmina Pringle. - It'd be like us coveting a Hastleblaght Zoe. Hey we want the best right? - Well I obviously do, look who I fell in love with. (barks) - I'm sorry. - Yikes. Goodnight. - Zoey, come here. What do you think? - Wow, I'm so impressed. - I don't believe my ears. - Don't flatter yourself. The lighting could be improved. You should have taken your assistant. - Oh hey, I wanna show you. Look, this is when I met Cass. This very shot was my first glimpse of her. I wanted to capture the actual subjects of Wheeler's posed shots but quickly to-- - Have them as unposed as possible. Expose the real self observing the social self. - You know me too well. - Well I know this much, I know that love is blind and one of us needs a seeing eye dog. - Am I that far gone? (chuckling) - Travis there's something I have to tell you. - Look is it about Cass? Because I know it seems shallow that I picked a beautiful model, it seems corny but she's beautiful on the inside too. - You're right. - You mean you can see that? - No, you're right it sounds corny. - Stop, she she has a degree in social work, she took care of her grandmother when she was dying of cancer, she has a good heart. - All I need to know is that you love her. - But I want you to like her Zoey. - Maybe I will in time. - What did you want to ask me? (phone ringing) Sorry. Hello, Cleveland Studios. Oh hey honey we're just... Whoa, whoa, whao, slow down. Cass do they know that that's not my specialty? Uh huh. Let me-- (phone clatters) The photographer from Cass's shoot has pneumonia. (chatting) - Cut, cut. - What sweet heart, tell us what? - This is not working. The wind, the smoke, my eyes are tearing, my makeup's running and there's a bee somewhere and I'm allergic to bees. - Maybe we should call in the swat team. - Zoey, turn the fan off. - Yup. (clatters) - Whoa, whoa. What is this the third mistake in the last three minutes? Who are you, the elephant child? - Hey she happens to be the best assistant around. Armond, if you have a problem talk to me. Don't worry about them we're doing great, okay? - This is unreal here, doesn't it bother you? - Hello? We're ready, does anyone care, can we shoot? - [Zoey] Hey Travis. - Hey good morning, how'd those prints turn out? Armond needs them by three. - Well the locomotive looks great. Oh something big came for you, I think it's from your aunt. - Oh cool, could you open it for me while I check these out? Elephant child. Hey don't you want to hear this? - Are you kidding of course I do, I was just pretending to respect your privacy. - Oh look. My darling nephew, I was so happy to hear you found your soul mate and I can't wait to meet her. - I remember how fascinated you were with the story of this dress. It wasn't my destiny to wear it but perhaps it could be your brides. I past the dress onto you now, in hopes that she will love it as much as I did. (gentle music) - This is the most beautiful wedding dress I have ever seen. - Well I'm sure it's a beautiful dress but can't I just think about it? My hearts so set on the Wilhelmina Pringle. - Yeah Cass, we can't afford that dress. - Daddy says he'll get it for me. - Look let's just wait until you see aunt Hannah's. I think that you're gonna love it and if you don't then I totally understand. - Okay. - Yeah? - Mmhmm. - So Armond didn't I tell you that he was a genius? - Obviously. I can't use these. They're far to, well they're to real. Women don't buy the cloth, they buy the image. The shot has to say fun, sex, danger, catch me, play with me. These say stiff girl standing on a train. - Cass told me you wanted real. - Well Travis I didn't mean this real. - They let you look natural and ravishing. Isn't that anyone's fantasy? - Don't worry I'll get you another chance. Armond's not the only coordinator in the business. - It's not my thing Cass. I'm happier doing the work I do. - Yeah but it's limiting financially. I mean, why not broaden your options? - I make a fine living. - Travis, oh my God, I'm so sorry I couldn't resist, please forgive me. - Nah it's okay Zoey, really it's okay. Wow you look, you really look, uh that dress, that dress is amazing. - Yes it is, isn't it? I see what you meant Travis it's totally one of a kind. - Travis I'm so embarrassed I had no right. - Well I can't wait to try it on. How about right now? - Why not? I'll just... Iris let's go for a walk. (barks) - So how long have you been in love with him? - I can't remember when I wasn't. I've written him a goodbye letter. Could you give it to him for me? - You're leaving? - Tomorrow morning. - Oh. Well I'll have to hire him a male assistant. Any woman would fall in love with him. - He gets more amazing the longer you've known him. - God this looks like a lampshade in a whorehouse. - Cass, you have no idea how much this dress means to Travis and his family, pretend to like it. It's crucial. - So why are you helping me out? - All the years I've known him, he's never been like this. He really loves you. Be good to him. (door thuds) (door creaks) - Hey, oh I missed you in the dress. - I'm so late to my parents, it's already three. I loved it though. - Okay, good, well I'll bring it with me so they can see it too. Where's Zoey? - Ah, honey, I hate to tell you on the run like this, but she said to tell you that she quit. She just left. - Are you serious? Did she say why? - Nothing, she was totally embarrassed. Maybe she just realized it was a dead end job. Anyway she said to tell you she's sorry. Travis forgive me, I have to go. - Yeah go, go. I'll see you at five. - Okay. - Bye. (door thuds) (engine rumbles) (door bell rings) - [Woman] I think it looks good. - [Woman] Yeah I think it's right. - [Woman] Yeah. - Travis is here with his aunt's wedding dress. - Mom you've got to stall him. - I'll introduce him to grandma. - We didn't think she'd ever find Mr. Right. She's too picky. - Well I'm glad she picked me. (chuckles) - I married the first man who winked at me. Just think I might've married some nitwit with dust in his eyes. (laughing) But fate was kind, I got me a plumb. But, he's gone now. I lost Mr. Hotchkiss to cancer two years ago. - Yeah Cass told me how close you and she became when she nursed you through your illness. - I've been in perfect health all of my life. - Oh I'm sorry maybe ah, maybe she was talking about her other grandmother. - She died before Cass was born. - Cass said this was when she was getting her degree in social work at UCLA. - Wouldn't that be something if they gave degrees in socializing? - But she did go to UCLA didn't she? - Oh Travis, forgive me but these are things you need to discuss with your bride. (doors clattering) - Travis. - I think you owe me an explanation. - And why is that? I don't tell you how to take your photographs do I? That's your territory and I respect that. - Yeah but this isn't just about a dress Cass. This is about what we mean to each other, this is about trust. Why would you lie about UCLA? - I didn't lie, I took some extension classes. - Why would you tell me grandmother had cancer? - So it was a friend's grandmother? - And what was that with Armond? You sold me down the river without a second thought. - I got you that opportunity and you blew it. - And you never had any intention of wearing the dress did you? - Well Travis, you're supposed to eat a wedding cake not wear it. - Wow. - This is my wedding day and if I can't make my own fashion statement on this day of all days, then guess who's not being respected? - You're absolutely right Cass and I don't think I can marry someone I don't respect. (dramatic music) (jingles) (dramatic music) (door bangs) (clatters) Iris, what's gotten into you? (dramatic music) - [Zoey Voiceover] How I've loved being your right hand, your left brain, your north pole and your south paw. It's sad that even with all those directions I still couldn't find my way into your heart. I'll always love you, Zoey. (clattering) - [Phone] The number you have reached has been disconnected and there is no new number. (clatters) (dramatic music) (clicking) (light hearted music) - 1,600 hours of school, then I get a license and I can cut hair. Like my uncle said a little hard work never killed anyone. - Yeah but why take the chance. - Not one nickel Billy. - Aw come on Lula I'm not here for money. - Of course not. Where would I get that idea? - Let me take you to lunch then. - I'm on a diet. - Well okay, well marry me then. Hey come on. - Oh sure so we can live in your mother's kitchen, sleep all day, scam all night. Oh and then we can have kids and you can grow up with them. - Lula. - Marriage is work, responsibility, something you know nothing about. You treat marriage like it's silly and marriage is serious. - But I am serious Lula. I need you in a serious, serious way. - Then do three things for me Billy. Get a car, a job and propose to me so sweet my knees quiver. - Well I think I have the first one covered. - Billy, where did you get this? - That's not all I got Lula, look I... I got a camera too. - You know what you're gonna get? You're gonna get a rap sheet a mile long. You stole this whole rig didn't you? - Come on Lula all I wanna steal is your heart. - Prove to me you're responsible and then we'll talk. (light hearted music) (engine rumbles) (vocalizing) (engine rumbles) (tires squealing) (light hearted music) (crying out) (tires squealing) (light hearted music) (bangs) - Hey! Hey you! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey are you alright? Where the hell you going? What about your car... (gentle music) (upbeat music) Oh Laura, Laura you work too hard. - I don't what you're looking at that menu for you know you're gonna have your regular. - I'm trying to turn over a new leaf here, do something different, give my life some new life. - Oh that would be nice. - So, I'll have a coconut donut. That's healthy right? (laughing) Hey, how's Paul doing? - I hardly ever see him. When he's not at the hospital he's at the library studying. - Well it's all gonna be worth it. I even got you an early wedding present. - Art. - Anybody see a dress in there? - Yeah no, it's a wedding dress. The camera I don't care about but the dress it's irreplaceable. - [Man] No, there's no dress in here. - God. - [Man] I didn't see any dress in there. - Hey is there anything you guys could do? Hey! Could you... Could you put out an APB on it? (dramatic music) - Oh my God. Art where did you get this? - It was a gift. - Somebody gave you a wedding dress? - Exactly. (gasps) Could use a good home huh? So, what do you think? - I've never seen anything so beautiful. You'd need a country club or a fancy hotel for something like this. - All you need is what you got. Now let's see what Paul thinks. (phone clatters) - I certainly hope it wasn't long distance. - Dr. Weineger. No, no, no I was just trying to call my future bride. We haven't seen each other since Sunday, I think. What day is it today? - Believe it or not, it was worse in my day. I remember my very first surgery. The procedure went perfectly but when it came time to sign the report I couldn't even remember my own initials. So how's Laura? - Working too hard, sacrificing too much. You know she deserves a special wedding but I'm afraid it's gonna be a paper bag lunch and a crackerjack ring. - Paul you are a billionaire where it counts. You invite me to the wedding. - [Laura] Don't come in here. - I need my bed. - [Laura] Honey please get a second wind tonight. I had such a wonderful day. - Good tips? - [Laura] I phoned the electric company, we got an extension. - Yeah, well if your getting amorous in there, forget it. (gentle music) - It's much to extravagant. I mean we'd have to rent the Four Seasons to go with it but, isn't it beautiful? Art gave it to me can you believe it? It needs a little fixing but... Look it even fits perfectly. May I have this dance? - I was wondering when this would happen. I am now officially hallucinating. (gentle music) - I'll find a home for it today. - Now don't you dare. We're keeping it. - Gotta be practical. - I'll never understand you. - That's love sickness that's all. And doctor, there ain't no cure. (light hearted music) - 2,000, this is very short notice, we'll need 1,000 in advance by tomorrow, cash, nonrefundable. - 2,000? We're on a very tight budget. - Up to you. Is a wedding something you put a price tag on? - I'll bring you the cash tomorrow. - I love Wednesdays! We're at home at the same time for two whole hours. Even when we're old and gray, let's celebrate Wednesdays okay? - A world full of voluptuous cynical women and I fall for a skinny romantic. They're all pink. You know that's not easy to accomplish, we should win something. My tuition was due last week. - We have it don't we? - No, we have $200 left. - What happened? I made a deposit. - Books, phone, rents, bus tokens. Plus your cruises to Bora Bora. - What can we do? - Maybe I should put off school until we have some money set aside. - Again? You've waited so long, this is your last year. Let's just postpone the wedding. - No. Everyday in the hospital I see how fragile life is. I refuse to postpone our dreams. (dramatic music) - Mmm, oh. You know repairs and dry cleaning alone are gonna cost me a small fortune. Then I've gotta tag it, mark and inventory it and sell it fast before it turns yellow. Want some gum? - It's a very special dress. You don't see detail-- - Ss, honey I have got 750 very specials in here and every one of them has some sort of story to tell. - How much do you think? - 600, oh woof, do you know what? I am too soft hearted for this business. (dramatic music) (light hearted music) - A grand. - It's worth at least four, it's solid gold. It was my father's. - And if I had a buck every time I heard that line it would buy me Fort Knox. Take the thousand go lucky. I'll give you 3,000 if you sell it to me outright. - No way. I'll take the thousand. I'll have the rest for you in a week. - We'll need the balance by Sunday. - But that's in three days. - Yes it is. - This is less than half his tuition. I can't over look the late payment penalty again. - I'll get it. - [Paul] Hello? - [Vendor] Is Laura there? - She's not here, may I ask who's calling? - [Vendor] This is Lauren at Wedding Belles. Um your fiancee brought in her dress this morning but it seems that she forgot to include the veil. - It didn't have one. At least I didn't see one. She having it altered? - Not unless she wants to buy it back. This dress is the rarest find of all. Mint condition, antique. Now you wanna go up to Velma's and pay retail for a cheezy design and polyester lace be my guest but $1,000 for this dress, a bargain. - Yeah and how much did you give Laura for it? - Woof, plenty, I am way too generous. - Well how about renting it? - We don't rent. - You could if you wanted to. - Look Romeo don't get smart okay? You wanna get up on that balcony you gotta climb a prickly vine. I don't make the rules $1,000 no checks, Visa or Mastercard. Gum however, is complimentary. - You told me 2,000 more if I sold it outright instead of taking the loan. - I must have been in a generous mood. But if that's what I said. - No Mr. Rodericks is not here. This is his fiancee may I ask what this is regarding? - [Concierge] Yes we show that he's reserved the Parisenne room here at the St. George, please remind him that the rest of the money is due Sunday. - The rest of the money? - [Concierge] Yes. - Of course. (clatters) Oh no the dress. (dramatic music) - [Paul] Hey honey. - Dr. Rodericks I presume. How was your day? - It's a jungle out there. Hey. Tomorrows that big dedication of the new wing but I'm on call til nine. - I was really looking forward to going. I never get out in the world without an apron. - [Paul] Well it was just a cocktail party. Are you okay? - Yeah it's just the bills and everything. - Go without me. Now, who can we get as an escort that wouldn't make me jealous? (light hearted music) (grunting) - Oh yeah, oh. Sold that dress yesterday. Well sweetheart a beautiful gown like that gets snatched right up. Look around, maybe you'll find something you like better. (light hearted music) - Oh no, somebody got it. - Oh Art I'm so sorry. You gave us such a wonderful gift-- - Don't you worry about me. I'm more worried about you. - Paul still thinks I have the dress. He rented a hotel banquet room for the wedding just so I could wear it and I think he pawned his father's watch. What am I gonna do? - Here. Well you could use a good fairy godmother. (chattering) Wow. Nice party especially the guests. Oh, sorry. - Oh so sorry. Laura? Dr. Weineger. I haven't seen you since last semester. - Dr. Weineger it's so good to see you too. I've been very busy this spring. - You and Paul both, he's my best student. So when are you two going to get married? - Excuse me. - Oh boy. Me and my big mouth. - Yeah but you have an arm like a Cadillac leaf spring. - I'm sorry do we-- - Art the Dart Panner. Marshall High, class of '63, running back. - Panner? Oh you old rat, I didn't recognize you. How do you know Laura? - Oh well Laura and Paul are like my own kids, you know. She's a little upset, they've got some big money problems. - Well can't her parents help out? I mean I know that Paul is an orphan. - No, her father left when she was kid, mother died a couple of years ago. Yeah, it's kinda hard to watch them struggle, don't you think? (light hearted music) - The dead line was noon Mr. Rodericks. We went ahead and book the room with another party. If you'll remember the deposit is nonrefundable. - But I was helping to save a man's life. I'm an hour late and you're keeping my $1,000? - My managers on vacation. I'm not authorized to refund nonrefundable deposits. - Don't ever get sick and come to my hospital Haswell. (bell dings) (light hearted music) - [Woman] I'll get the door. - [Man] Sure this stuff is okay in the hall? - [Woman] Oh yeah. - How's it going guys? (light hearted music) - [Man] Alright. - [Man] No it look great. (chattering) (light hearted music) - Ta da. - [Woman] Oh hey Art. - Hey, does anyone need some coffee to calm their nerves? - Hey Art I'm so glad you could come. What do you think? - Oh wow does she know that you're wearing a tux? - Shhh. (light hearted music) - Come on here. We are getting married today . (light hearted music) - Hey, hey, hey everybody. (knocking) Can I come in? I need my toothbrush. - Now don't peak. You're not supposed to see the bride before the ceremony. - But I've already seen you in the dress if that's what you mean. - Ah, Paul, I have a confession to make, I um, I sold the dress to pay for your tuition and I feel so terrible and I know that you sold your dad's watch to pay for the hotel and now we don't have a dress or a watch... - Guess what, guess what? I have a confession too. The hotel stole my deposit and gave the room to somebody else. - What? - But, but that was after I got a call from Lauren at Wedding Belles. (gasps) (chuckling) (gasping) Not bad huh? - I love you. Hi everybody. - [All] Hi. (knocking) - Hi everybody. - [Woman] Hi Doctor. - Paul I know, I'm sorry, I'm early but, well, Art and I wanted to give you a wedding present. - You can't give away something this precious. (chattering) - Oh hey. - Laura hurry I can't wait to see you in this dress. Come on. - That's right, we are in a hurry Paul we have to be somewhere in 15 minutes. - But the minister isn't here yet. - He's been detained. - Yeah he was taken hostage. - What? What did you guys do? - Yeah 30 years I've been driving cab. Save, save, save for what? A tombstone? - Well where we gonna go? - The Parisenne room at the St. George. Now you wait til you see-- - Come on Art don't give the whole thing away. - I can't believe this is happening. - [Laura] Ready everybody? (romantic music) (thuds) (gasping) (coffee splashes) - Oh my God. My God what have I done? - Paul, I'm marrying you not the dress. Now I am the happiest woman in the world today and nothing is going to change that. Give me two seconds everyone. (romantic music) (gentle music) Hey Travis long time no see. - Hey, are you married yet or is there still a chance for me? - I am so married it's disgusting. Where's our Zoey? I haven't seen her in months. - I have no idea. She's gone without a trace. - Wow. She was so in love with you it wasn't funny. - How is it that everybody could see that but me? - Maybe you need to get yourself some glasses. (gentle music) - If I'm not mistaken there should be one more. Was a medical student, Roderic, Rodericks, Rodericks. - Oh yeah, you should have seen what we had to do, it looked like someone threw a pot of coffee at the bride. (laughing) - Must've been a wild wedding. Okay I will be right back. I'm just gonna put these in the van. - Wait, you want me to help you with that? - No that's alright, I'm stronger than I look. Why don't you look for the other one? (clattering) - Be careful lady or you'll lose everything. - Oh my God Billy. You work here? - Oh is that what they call it? Two months of continuous employment? - Wow that some kind of a record. You look so official in that uniform. - Yeah, the blue kinda matches my eyes don't you think? I also got a raise. - Oh yeah? You got a car yet? - Just don't go anywhere okay, like, wait just a minute. Here you go. - Oh great thanks, now this is billed to the hospital right? - Yes everything's all taken care of Mrs. Carver. - Okay. - Um do you want me to carry that for you. - No, no, no you've got another customer. - She's a special one. - Bye. - Thank you. - I can't find my ticket. - No problem, I have the authority to have it totally taken care of. Just sign here. And you can put down your ring size too because you know I might be wanting to put a deposit on a certain something. - Now slow down Billy. Winning my heart is not like playing a lottery ticket. - I know, I know, I'm fully aware. A job, a car, a proposal. You know but this is good you know, we got rules you know, we got some structure you know. It's all good. In fact I, I gotta document it. Relax, it's mine. (clicking) - Hey, hey, hey Billy, Billy. We need a word, again. - So the theme of this years fund raiser is the Wedding Dress. Do you think that's politically incorrect Robert? Men bidding for dates with the women who model the dresses. Last year somebody paid $5,000 to nibble wilted water cress with Mora Thickman. - Isn't she married to that accountant? - Yeah who by the way, calculated that Mora's bidder paid $300 a bite. Ever since then he's treated her like a much more valuable asset, he calls her his little write off. - I'd bid on my own wife. - Yeah, go for it. It's at the children's hospital. (gentle music) - [Woman] Where do you think you're going? (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey hon. - Hey. - Hey the New York trip is back on the books again. Jeff and I are on the four o'clock. I'll be back Friday late okay? (giggling) - Sure. Where are you? It sounds like you're having a good time. - Just leaving a boring business lunch. I'm calling you tonight. Kiss Stella. (phone beeps) - [Woman] We don't wanna be late. (thuds) - Mommy, when's daddy coming home? - I don't know. - Does he know? - Well I'm not sure. - So, nobody knows. - Yeah, I'm sorry Stella but nobody does know. (kettle whistling) (door bell rings) - Mrs. Carter. - Yes. - I'm sorry to just come over like this. I begged the cleaners to give me your address. My daughter's wedding is the day after tomorrow and her dress was being altered. I think it was given to you by mistake. - Well I don't have the dresses here. They're being stored at the hospital. It's for a benefit thing. - Is this your dress? - I don't know, I mean the dresses were donated I just picked them up. It's very, very pretty. Look at those little pearls. I think that lace is all handmade. It's really, it's exquisite. - Unfortunately it doesn't fit my daughter. - No, well, um. I would take you over there but I'm, I'm busy so I'll just get a pen and paper and give you directions. - Here's a pen, just write it on my arm. - Where? You've got the phone book here. Why don't you give me your other arm. - It's the best secretary in the world. The only downside is it looks a little idiotic. - You're the only other person I've met who does this. I'd take that as a good sign except you're the only person I've ever met who carries around a spoon. (sighs) - Um look, why don't I, why don't I just drive over there and you can follow me okay? But you take the dress. - But I thought you were busy? - Well I lied, I'm just depressed and I wanted to be left alone. - That's the worst thing you can do if you're depressed. - I know don't remind me. It's too depressing. - I know the feeling. It's like looking at your life through the wrong end of a telescope. I'm Steve. - I'm Madeline. This one it? - No it's ah, it's the wrong style. Well, no dress, no preacher and no flowers. She'll keep the groom under house arrest. - Why no preacher and no flowers? - Ah the preacher has laryngitis, florist thought it was next Saturday. And you stole my dress. - Hey. Look, is this it? This one? - That's it. Thank God. - I'm a landscape architect, I could help you with the flowers. Only I'm very expensive. - That's okay I'm rich and I'm desperate. - I'm not really very expensive. - I'm not rich, I'm just desperate. (laughing) - [Steve] Oh, Kathy I can't do this. Trying to thread a needle with boxing gloves on. - I can get it daddy. I was just trying to make you feel useful. (laughing) I miss mom today. - Everyday honey. (tapping) - Now your dad said you wanted something, something different so. - Wow I love it! White is so, white. - Hey the church looks terrific. - Well congratulations and don't forget to breathe, okay. Oh. Hi sweetie. - Thank you for everything. - Well you are welcome. Bye. - Mommy I'm so hungry. Can we get some pizza? - Sure, would you like to order it yourself? (phone ringing) - Hello? Hi daddy. When are you coming home? He wants to talk to you. - Mmhmm? - Why haven't you been answering my calls. - This is the last time you're gonna hear my voice. My lawyer will call you sometime this week. - Who did you get? - Your worst nightmare. - You're doing something you're really gonna regret. - No, Rob what I regret is having married you. (knocking) - Look what I found in my truck. - It's deja vu all over again. - I think that dress has your name on it. Will you wear it at the benefit? - Well I don't know, it'll take a little work. A lot of work. - So ah... - Thank you. - Sure. Um I wanted to ask you something. - No Steve, no I'm getting a divorce now. And frankly, no offense I am allergic to men right now. I don't want a male parakeet under this roof. I don't want a mosquito with male paraphernalia. - Well if I'd been trying to pick you up that would have been the sexiest response I can imagine. - Well weren't you trying to, pick me up? - It's not that, you're very, you know you're very beautiful. Truth is my wife was the love of my life and I don't anticipate recovering from losing her. - Well I understand that. - So now having cheered you up. What I was actually gonna ask you, I'm running a job that needs a landscape architect and, let me give you the number in case you decide you're interested. (gentle music) (gentle music) - Hello this is Madeline Carter, I'm a landscape architect, I'm calling at Steve Blaine's suggestion. - My neighborhood association is considering picketing me. They say I've gotta tidy this place up. - You might buy a rake. You could have told me this was for you. - I was afraid you'd get the wrong impression. So what do you think? - Well, I think it has possibilities. (light hearted music) - [Steve] Hey. - [Madeline] Hey. - Just lost half an hour looking for this. - Oh I'm sorry I-- - I hope you're a good climber. - Hey! This entire pile has to move alright? - [Woman] Yeah. - We gotta do that now and then we gotta put down the decomposed granite. - [Woman] Okay. - And that soil and then the mulch and, and, and what am I forgetting? Then the roses. That's right. - Hey can you keep it down? Men are trying to concentrate here. (laughing) - That's their problem. Okay go, that things gotta go. - That doesn't look half bad. - It's coming along. - There's another project on the horizon, a big one. Fix you and Stella a home cooked meal Saturday night if you'll come over and look at the plans. - I don't know, sounds a lot like a date. - It's not a date. - Well what is it then? - To place an estimate. - You know what? Robert never once washed a dish or made a meal, not once the entire time we were married. - And you let him get away with that? - I was as blind as a bat. You know how you look at your yearbook and you see that frizzed out hair do and you think oh my God what was I thinking? That's how I feel about Robert and his attitude and his infidelity. Why couldn't I see it? - How could you? You were in love with him. - Yes I was, very much. And what do you miss the most about your wife? - Everything. Hey you girls stop jumping on that sofa. Jump on the other one so that it gets equal damage. (laughing) - Do you think you'll ever risk falling in love again. - I don't know. I got lucky once I'm not sure I believe in second chances. - I think I better go home. - I think you're right. (knocking) - [Madeline] Just a minute. Shh. - [Robert] Please baby open the door I missed you. - Robert? - [Robert] I miss Stella, honey. - [Madeline] Oh Stella is sleeping. - [Robert] Open up please. (knocking) - You Robert? - Yeah. Who are you? - That's not important. (door clicks) (dramatic music) - Hey Stella when you're done there we could use a little help clearing the table. Okay hon? How do you do this garbage thing? (motor rumbles) I have to be in court for eight o'clock, I need to make a few calls. This'll be a quick call. - I just wanted to thank you. - Maddy, I wanted to come back, no need to thank me. I'll just be a sec. - No I mean, I wanted to thank you for leaving me. - What do you mean? (dramatic music) - Right, hey, hey to the other side. - [Man] Okay. - Good thanks. - Have you seen Steve? - No I haven't, sorry. - Do you know where he is? - I really don't know. (dramatic music) (answering machine beeps) - Steve, it's me, here we are both of us terrified. I know I am a mess. You know I guess there's very good reason, you don't believe in second chances it's cause of this. Did you come by my house today? Well I mean who knows what you're feeling. Well you know what you're feeling. You know all I know is, is, I, you and we do you know what I mean? (chuckling) (clatters) (audience applauding) - [Auctioneer] Who wants to buy dinner with Sara York in a magnificent Vera Wang. - [Man] 300. - [Auctioneer] Did I just hear $300? - [Man] You certainly did. - Cheap date thank you very much Mr. York. (audience applauding) Now moving along to number 25, this is a whole new slant on the way they welcomed the boys home. This is Madeline Cater in a redesigned, vintage World War II dress. - [Man] 90. - I already hear 90. Can I please hear $100. People this is for the children. Someone 200 please. Thank you. Can I hear 250? - [Man] 250. - 250 thank you. Can I hear 300? Wait I, I see $800, sold for $800. To the gentleman in the tuxedo. Thank you sir. - Number 25 I believe you owe me a meal. - Steve. - I never bought anyone before so I don't know whether I should bow to you or throw you over my shoulder. - Well I think technically you just rented me for dinner. - Time's short then. To hell with bowing. - Oh! (gasping) (audience applauding) - What? You lost another job? - I can't believe it. - I can. You don't concentrate. - Well I'm gonna get a new one at a courier service. - What about a car? - Well not yet but I'm gonna get one. - Well while you're in such a getting mood, you better get yourself another girl. - Courier. - Oh Billy from the dry cleaners. - Ah that didn't work out. - Oh. - Hey Mrs. Carter, I'm really late. - Oh okay. Um this one goes to the museum and this one goes to the historical society and maybe you can help me with this? - Here we go. (rips) (beads clicking) (gasps) Oh my God, I'm, I'm, I'm really sorry Mrs. Carter. - Right. Thank you. Well it's okay Billy. It's okay because it's a very special dress and I don't think a little damage is gonna make any difference okay? Here, if you just lay that tissue over the top that'd be really good. Just fold up the sides. Here, waybill. Take it. - I know put it on the top. - [Madeline] Okay. (clattering) (clattering) - Deke Johannsen do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. - You do realize the penalty for prejury do you not Mr. Johannsen? - Ben just ask Deke if the creek changed course by itself or if he went out there and diverted it with his tractor as Joan claims he did. - I never touched that creek. (giggling) - Mr. Johannsen you are aware are you not, that the creek bed is the original property line between yours and Ms. Delanos properties. - Objection Your Honor, the deed states only that the creek bed shall mark the boundary, it makes no reference to natural forces. Last month's rain could just as easily have diverted into Deke's property. - Sustained. - What? - Looks to me like an act of God Fred. - Well what about the tractor noise coming from Deke's the night before? Your Honor we are all well aware of Deke's devious ways around here. - Objection. - Over ruled. - May I say something Your Honor? - I'm all ears. - I most distinctly heard the clanking of metal treads, now that's a sound I know very well, believe me. After 18 years of living next to that philistine junk yard that he calls a sculpture garden. - The only clanking Ms. Delano heard that night was her yellow dentures on her little pink night stand. (laughing) - Objection! I do not wear dentures. Call in Dr. Wrinker and have him bring in my xrays. And furthermore, my nightstand is blue. (laughing) (gavel banging) - Settle down, settle down. - Your Honor Deke Johannsen is an aesthetic nightmare of a neighbor. How can an artist survive next to a war zone? - It's a sculpture garden! (gavel bangs) - Just out of curiosity, which one of you lived there first? - Well that'd be me Your Honor, I got first rights, early bird gets the worm. - Yes but the second mouse gets the cheese. (laughing) - Well here's a plain fact for you. Judge my tractor's been broke down for the last six months. I got a signed statement from Ralph down to the garage. (chattering) - Well I'd say that wraps it up. Here's my ruling, it's common knowledge that Deke here and Joan have lived in discord for as long as any of us can remember, therefore in the interests of settling this once and for all I order Deke Johannsen to rechannel that creek bed back to it's previous God given course. - Yes. (applauding) - And I order Joan Delano to pay for a survey to act as a permanent record of the property line until hell freezes over or I get my hair back which ever happens first. (applauding) And as an addendum I order both parties to exercise neighborly civility towards each other or I will remand you both to the county jail for 10 days. (gavel bangs) (light hearted music) (engine rumbles) (light hearted music) (engine rumbles) - Oh God. The junk man cometh. (engine rumbles) (engine rumbles) (thuds) (cries out) - This is private property! - [Deke] It's just a bunch of old rags. (engine rumbles) - Oh my goodness. You're no rag. (gentle music) (light hearted music) (engine rumbles) - The point of beginning. - Okay that sections there's done. (engine rumbles) - Zoey? - I was gonna call you but I know how you love surprises. - Is this a mirage or is this my wild child? - This is a wild mirage. - So tell me everything. - I've already told you everything. - Keep going. What do you hear from Travis? - Travis who? - Oh dear, something's never change. (upbeat music) - [Zoey] So you and Deke aren't still feuding are you? - Deke who? - Oh man, somethings never change. You know what this has been going on for so long I can't remember what started it. - Well whatever it was you can be sure it was his fault. Zoey, I have to show you something. (gentle music) - Mom, this is extraordinary work. - It's not done yet. - What gave you this idea? - Oh I was blocked for so long, all I could do was prep canvas and clean brushes and then this beautiful old dress came, instead of my rag order. Don't question good fortune as your grandma used to say. - I think this may be my favorite painting you're ever done. (engine rumbles) - Okay shut it off. - [Zoey] So? - Yeah it's your voltage regulator. But I could fix that for you today. Anything else that's concerning you? - Well, since you brought it up. - Well go ahead and ask me. Turns out I'm the local genius. - I have a theory about why you and mom have been at each other for so long. You two have some kind of weird dependency on each other. I don't think either one of you would know what to do if the other one weren't around. Am I right? - Let me tell you something. Part of being a genius is knowing when to keep your mouth shut. (clangs) - Unbelievable. Mom approved the survey, that's a good sign. - I'll tell you what I'll fix this car for ya if you promise not to mention your mother again. - What mother? (chattering) - Laura. - [Laura] Hey Deke what can I get for ya? - I'll have the T bone, a coffee, mashed potatoes, string beans, side of fries and onion rings, that soup de jour and some bread and I'll have the peach pie a la mode for desert. - [Laura] Alright coming up. - Hey cancel that, I just changed my mind. - It's good you're going Johannsen. Leaves enough food for the rest of us. - Ms. Delaino-- - Delano. - You can kiss my rusty butt. - Ew, oh, I've been contaminated. He reeks of WD40. - I think he's cute. - Poo. (cries out) Did you see that? He mooned me! He's in violation of Judge Philips ruling I should have him arrested. - I hate to say so but you asked for it mom. - Well I didn't ask for that. Rusty butt, no kidding. - [Zoey] What do I get for all this posing? - [Joan] Motherly love. - Oh no, anything but that. Oh, I gotta take a break. - Two minutes. - Okay two minutes. (clatters) Oye sorry. (dramatic music) Mom? - [Joan] What? - This, this is the dress you painted? - That's it. It's something isn't it? - Mom I know this dress. - You what? - Travis... Travis's dream girl married him in this dress. It belonged to his aunt. How in the world did this ever end up in a box of rags? - Zoey that can't be the same one. - Mom I know it is. There used to be pearls all over this bodice. And the sleeves have been removed but you see this? Nobody blind stitches like this anymore. Look at this beautiful neckline. - Maybe you could restore it to it's former glory? (engine rumbles) (door bangs) - Hi. - Hi Zoey. Here you go. She's running real good now. - Yay thank you. - Who's the lucky groom? - Oh it's not for me it's my mom's. I wish I could afford to pay you something Deke. - Oh Zoe that's my pleasure, I live for the days when things break down. (chuckles) - Is she moving away then? - Maybe, she hasn't decided yet. Mom, Deke thinks the dress is yours. You should have seen the look on his face when I suggested you were getting married. - Well why on earth would you tell him a thing like that? - You two haven't had a good fight in awhile. Things are getting a little dull around here. He said he didn't care anyway. - Well of course he doesn't. He said that? (light hearted music) (engine rumbles) (clattering) - [Man] How much you want for this car? (engine rumbles) (light hearted music) - I don't believe it, he's finally getting rid of all that junk. - Hey mom, do you still want this pearl bracelet? It's broken. - You wanna use it for your dress? I'd love you too. (laughing) - He's doing it for you you know. - Trust me Zoey someone made him an offer he can't refuse. Look whatever, I don't have to look at that junk yard again. - Mom, believe it, he cares about you so much he swallowed his pride and gave up something that's really precious to him. Do you know what I would give to have someone love me like that? (phone ringing) Delano residence. - [Deke] Can I speak to Joan please? - She's right here. - Hello? - Well I hope you'll be happy now. - Deke, thank you, two words I thought I'd never say to you. - Yeah well could I hear them again? I didn't hear 'em the first time on account of being in shock. - Don't push your luck. - [Deke] Well, goodbye then. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - And thank you. (clatters) (light hearted music) - Joan. If you run away and get married things aren't gonna be the same around here. - Who's running? - You're gonna live here with your new husband? - If someone asks me to marry them, I wouldn't budge from this place if that's what you mean. - Isn't that your dress? - I couldn't get into that dress with a crowbar you ridiculous man. (gentle music) - You know I always planned on getting married myself someday. - Why didn't you? - Oh you know, life's little clutters. But I just recently cleared out some notions and now I'm afraid. If I was to get down on one knee now I might not be able to get up again. - Deke, you're the one who gave up your jun... Artifacts and on top of that you've come all the way up to me, on my property, without a shotgun. What's your middle name? - My grandpa's name Albert. - Well, Deke Albert Johannsen will you, will you... - Yes. - Have dinner with me? (laughing) - Yes I will, yes I will. Miss Delano. Yes. (gentle music) - Okay, don't look til I say so. (banging) Oh, be careful. Kay keep your eyes shut. Okay, watch yourself. Keep your eyes shut. Hold it. (door bangs) Alright. Okay, open 'em. - And you got a job? - I realized there was a reason why I couldn't hold down those other jobs, I didn't want those jobs but I now know what I want. - And that's really your car? - The car, the job, and now this. (gentle music) So you're all out of excuses. Lula, I promise to cherish you, I promise to spoil you. - Billy, I don't know what to say. - No, no, don't say anything, let me. Loving you has changed my whole life and Lula I didn't change my whole life so you could change your mind. - Go on about the spoiling part. - First can I see your knees? Things are looking good. (giggles) (gentle music) - Hey I'll get the door for ya. - Cheers. Should have that new dark room finished by the end of the week. - Funny that's what you said last week. - Okay you got me. (chuckling) - See ya. - See ya. (door thuds) (knocking) (dog barking) - Hey Iris! Hey it's just Steve relax. (barks) Stop it's Steve. Zoey. - Hey baby. - I don't believe it. - Hey you. - I tried to find you, you have no idea. - Hannah told me. I talked to her this morning. All this time I thought you were married. - God no, I... No. Come in, please. Oh hey come meet my new assistant. Ah, fifth one since you and the best by far. - Hey, I'm Billy. - Hi. - Is she the Zoey? - Yeah, she's the one. - Wow no wonder. - And I'm the fool that let her get away. - I have something to give you. (gentle music) I think this belongs to you. (gentle music) - Hey isn't that the... Nah, nevermind. - Billy don't you have prints to develop? - Come on Iris (whistles). wuz up? (barks) - Zoey how did you find this? - Well I guess you could say it found me. (clattering) (barking) - [Billy] Sorry. - You have no idea how many times I think about that day, with you and the dress. - Really? - Oh yeah. It's even more beautiful than I remember it being and so are you Zoey. So are you. Come here. (romantic music) (lid thuds) (clicks) (gentle music)
