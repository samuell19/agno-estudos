What a sense of humour! Where do you work, son? Actually... I work at-- He works as a quality head in an MNC. I see. What's the name of the company? The name of the company-- It's a very big and reputed company. But what is it called? Um... Cando Condoms. Mr Lamba, this job will ruin my life. I don't wish to do it any more. I am requesting you. No, I beg of you! I will also give you a raise. But please, don't quit this job. I will not stay even if this company is handed over to me. Please, don't say that. What should I tell my friends and relatives? What does he do? He makes condoms. You don't have to berate the condoms. I am never getting married if I continue with this job. Of course, you will get married, but you will not find a job as noble as this. I am a college graduate, with Honours! And there is something called, honour. You will get honour here as well. The factory is filled with it. I will do anything but work at this seedy place. Get out of my way. Please! You'll get hurt. Shall I serve lunch? KARNAL Chemistry is very easy once you understand it. Can I show you something interesting? Yes, Ma'am. Do you really want to see it? Yes, Ma'am. -Yes, Ma'am. Can I have a rupee bill? -Sure. Here you go. Hey, now my father will kill me! How did you do this magic trick? It's not a magic trick. It's just chemistry. Ethanol would have burnt the bill. So, we added some water. So, ethanol burnt away and the bill is intact! Come on! Write down the chemical formula of ethanol. Hey, what are you doing? -Mum needs it on the terrace. Wait! Get back to the formula. Wait! Where are you going? Give it back. Praise the Lord! Wait! Here you go, Mum. -Oh, hell! Mum! Mum! How many times have I told you that you can never be a gambler, let alone being a winner! Yesterday, you lost a jar in the game. And yet, here we are. Are you going to bet on us next? Your mother is about to pull a miracle. This move will win back everything I've lost. You'll see. -Sure! Hey, loser gang! Get lost from here! Else, I will make sure that you lose all your hair! Come on, get going. -Yes, sure. Just settle our account. Your account? You, low-life nuts! You have some cheek! Come on, leave. Come on, let's go! Get the hell out of here. Hey, you-- Mum! How many times have I told you not to do this? I am managing it, right? Oh, sure. Your measly tutoring jobs are going to make us billionaires. Of course, not. Obviously, gambling is the best way to become a billionaire! A billionaire, it seems! I'm going for an interview. I will get a job in no time. Kill me, now! KALRA PUJA SHOP FOR EVERY DEVOTIONAL NEED Greetings. Please, don't do that! An employer should not greet an employee like this. I say this every day, but you never listen. Uncle, we are answerable to Him, this is where I earn the money, and this is how I earn my blessings. God bless you. I'm going down, call me if you need anything. -Okay. Chotu! -Yes, sir. Go down and get a carton. There is an order to be delivered. I'll tell you the list. Dad, please, keep this. Rishi, 'bhaiji' had called. He has asked you to attend Amit's engagement this evening. Make sure that you don't forget it, or else the volcano named, 'bhaiji' will erupt once again. Yes, I will go. Chotu, note this down. Five thousand lamps, twenty-five kilos of almonds, ten thousand incense sticks, two hundred kilos of ghee, Please, write it down. Yes, sir. -Okay. Two sacks of mango wood. Make sure it's mango wood, and not sandalwood. It's for a wedding, not a funeral. It doesn't make any difference, sir. He is set for my doom. Are all the messages ready? Yes, the marketing campaign is ready to go. The messages of 'Good morning', 'Good afternoon', and 'Good evening' placed on the background images of Lords Ganesha, Goddess Laxmi, and Lord Shankar. The name of the shop, 'Kalra Puja Shop' will be at the bottom, along with your phone number. Add my name as well. -Okay, sir. Dad, please, give the bike keys to Pintu when he comes. He will get it serviced. I'll be back in a bit. Where are you going? Mahavir Nagar. A priest hasn't paid his dues. Instead, he just sends his blessings on WhatsApp. Let me seek his blessings in person. Please, take this seat. You must be tired from running after the bus. You must be getting late for work-- -Are you hitting on me? Excuse me? You are misunderstanding me. I just saw that you-- -Really? Based on my clothes, you took me for a modern girl. And you assumed that I must be an easy girl. You give up your seat only for pretty girls, right? That's not true. You are misunderstanding me... It's cut! Dad, a bill of 2000 rupees! Mr Lamba, look closely. It must be a 1000-rupee bill, gone obsolete after demonetization. No, it is a 2000-rupee bill. Wait, I'll just show you. Hey! Hey, you! Yes, you! Why are you cheating? Why did you use that rock? Hey! Dad, this string is like a hardened felon! It's just not cracking! Let’s try a bit harder. It's just not breaking! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Are you calling me? Yes, you! If you don't know how to fly a kite, try a balloon! Why did you have to cheat using that rock? It's you who is cheating, not me! You are clearly using a metal string! Uncle, could a kite attached to a metal string ever fly? Here's a thing, come on up and break it. If you succeed, you can have the 2000-rupee bill, otherwise, the bill will be ours. I'm coming up to show you. Just keep a slice of lemon ready! A lemon? Does she want to have a lemonade? Amazing! Isn't it amazing? How did you do this magic trick? It's not a trick, it's just chemistry. I'll explain it. 'We have to apply C3H6 to increase the tensile strength of the string.' 'C3H6 means, polypropylene.' 'When you get the spool, just apply polypropylene along the entire length of the string.' 'Polypropylene increases the strength of the string.' 'And our string is ready!' 'Just stick a 2000-rupee bill to your kite, and watch it soar into the sky!' It has been cut! Isn't it amazing? Come on, let me have my money. Sure. Please, hurry up! -Here. Thank you. This is what I like about the young generation. They include smallest of the detail while explaining a chemical reaction. By the way, what do you do? I am a college graduate in chemistry. But presently, I am working as a chemistry tutor. I can tutor your son. He will be able crack the toughest of the entrance tests, for sure! Otherwise, he will continue wasting his energy in these petty antics. I must get going. Did you see that? Now, I don't have to run from pillar to post. The girl has been found! But she is a girl. You are planning on offering her a job at the plant? Do you wish to get beaten up? Sattu, nowadays, there is no difference between genders. And I really like this quality about the young generation. Don't worry. I'll manage. Okay, then. You better manage it. CHANGE THE WRONG JOB TO THE RIGHT ONE. UPGRAD. Uncle! Oh, my! Aren't you the chemistry tutor? That's right. Since that day, I knew that you will return with an offer. Right. The demonstration was quite powerful, right? Excuse me? So, was that demonstration given for my benefit? I am so stupid. I was stressed for no reason, and I kept wondering whether you'll agree to do it. What are you saying? Why wouldn't I do it? To be honest, there are no jobs available in this city. You know something? One should not turn down a job offer. Darling, I really like this quality about the young generation. They don't accept an elapsing job, and they never turn down a potential job offer. That's true. After all, it's just chemistry. Absolutely! It's just chemistry. Nobody gets it. Uncle, theory, practicals, tests, everything will improve! You can stop worrying now. Darling, your passion and enthusiasm towards work has made my eyes well up. I do have passion. So, have you done these tests before? Yes, of course! Obviously, there are tests in chemistry. The Lord has answered my prayers. I was looking for a girl, just like you. Come to the plant tomorrow, -Okay. and get started with the work. -Yes. Which plant? The plant... which produces my product. The product which needs to be tested. Which test? Um... Remember what you told me, about the tensile strength? Uniform pressure. It's about that. It's all the same. So, this isn't about chemistry tutoring for your son? Tutoring? I was... offering you a job. What job? -Take a look. What is it? Here's my ad, 'Looking for a condom-quality tester’. Uncle, respect your age, at least! You should be ashamed of yourself, for making such propositions! Yes, initially, I did feel ashamed. When my father planted this idea in the plant. You are incorrigible! But this is noble work. It's noble work. -Noble work? Do you want me to gather people? Do you? Look, you have misunderstood me. You don't have to make anyone try it on, you just have to test it. -Trying it on? Uncle, now I will test the tenacity of my shoe! Darling, there is an explosion of population in all of Karnal. -Let me show you. Please visit the plant, just once. Just once. -His plant! I need a person like you, for the quality control. It's just chemistry. And there will be an increment for you even before joining the company. Your salary will be 25,000 rupees. No! No? But-- Okay, how about 30,000? No! Let's finalize it on 35,000. Uncle, 'no' means, no! ?? Don't you understand it? I will take up any job, but this! Get lost! Do you want me to gather people? It’s a public service! Think about it. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "Here is my story." "Narrated by yours truly." "It's no fiction." "My story is not an ordinary one!" "But it happens in every household." "The gossip sprinkles, like rain showers!" "The taunting never stops, even on the home turf." "She'll save you from them." "She'll conceal it all." "She'll make you laugh." "She'll show you dreams." "She is here, to make the dreams come true!" "Chhatriwali!" "Chhatriwali!" "Chhatriwali!" "Chhatriwali!" Shuffle them, once again! My salary will be 50,000 rupees. Um... 50? Don't you think that's a lot? Alright. Find someone else. No! Agreed. Agreed. But I have a condition. Nobody should ever find out that I work here. Done. Not a soul outside this plant will know about it. But I have a condition as well. You will not quit this job for a year, at least. Get the papers ready. I'll start tomorrow. I like this quality about the young generation. Whatever might be the job, they never compromise on the salary. 'Make a move!' 'Make a move!' Mum! How the hell did she come? -Sanya is here. Come on, get lost from here! Don't go in there. -Not there! Mum! -A bunch of morons! Ouch! God! -Mum! I am here. -Mum! Mum! Mum! I might slip and fall-- Mum, time to ditch the broom, we are getting a vacuum cleaner. Huh? I got a job! And just guess the salary! -Tell me. It's 50,000 rupees! Here you go! My child! You must go down and seek the blessings. Yes, of course. Which company is it? It's... um... Do you know the umbrella company -Yeah. which makes umbrellas? That's the one. I have been appointed as the quality-control head. The quality-control head. -I see. I am so glad that you got a job at an umbrella company. Because the older designs of umbrellas just... come apart! And then, they begin to leak. What a shame! And we end up getting drenched. True, isn't it? One more thing. Make sure, there are lots of designs and colours to choose from. I am just fed up with the polka dots. Don't worry, Mum. Not just colours and dots, I will make sure that these umbrellas have flavours as well! Okay, I'll go now. Auntie, how do they get flavours in umbrellas? Flavours? Darling, here's your uniform. From now on, this factory, its production, as well as my life, depends on you. Please, come in. Come in. Here she is. Darling, this is our lab. Now, I'm going to tell you about the problems we face here. For a perfectly functional condom, air, water, and electric testing, are the most important tests. When a condom passes these tests, eventually, it results in a happy couple! It's started now. This is the air test. Please, twist it. Keep doing it. Now, press the lower part. No, not with your fingers, use your hand, like this. Do it this way. So that we can find if there is any leakage. I am sorry, darling. Really sorry. The entire problem is related to the leakage. Henceforth, you should manage it. I also wish that the quality becomes absolutely watertight! Sanya, how was the first day? Um... It was nice. Quite good. It was nice. What happened? Is this how you play? -Come on! Mr Lamba, I have to discuss something important with you. Darling, I just got your agreement franked. Now, you can't quit this job before a year-- Put them back, Mr Lamba. Just put them back. The entire stock of latex is degrading! Really? But the supplier has sent us tested stock. And it's well within the expiration date. I'm sure, that's true. But here, it's stored as if it's firewood! Mr Lamba, this is a chemically sensitive substance. It reacts with water as well as air. And the weakening of tensile and ductile strength causes the oops. Please, order a fresh stock. Mr Lamba, I'm leaving now. 'I have to attend my friend's engagement party.' Which flavour is good? The pistachio flavour is nice. Hello. Hi. I'll have the pistachio flavour. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something important. Do you want to apologize for chewing me out on the bus? It's okay. Anyway, there are no gentlemen left in this city. May I have it? You are right. And the remaining ones are in demand. Yes, I mean, everybody's getting married. That's true. These ladies have been hounding me with their questions, all evening. Do you see that lady? Which one? The one in magenta outfit. I see. She has too many questions. She has grilled me enough to trace my family tree. That's my mum. Really? Actually, she seems to be a nice lady. She is very beautiful. Just like you. Hey, what's your name? I'm Rishi. Sanya. Nice to meet you. Same here. Once again. Once again. Honestly, the purpose of these weddings and functions is exactly this. To be honest, I am a bit averse to attend these weddings. But today, I'm glad to be here. You are working someplace, right? Yes. I am working. Which company? Um... The umbrella factory. I see. I work there as a quality-control head. That's great. I am not the brightest bulb when it comes to studying. Thanks to 'bhaiji', I own a shop, selling goods required for religious ceremonies. But when it comes to business, I'm sharper than Sherlock Holmes. Have you heard of, 'Kalra Puja Shop'? That's mine. I see. I'll show you a magic trick. Sure. Although I don't have your contact number, you will still receive my message. What does that mean? Magic! Kalra Puja Shop! That's the one! It's viral on all the family-WhatsApp groups. This message also has my contact number at the bottom. Personal. You can call me... if need be. So, I'll call you. If need be. TICKET WINDOW "You are my safe haven." "You live in my heart." "Life is filled with happiness, because of you." "I don't know why, but I miss you every moment." "Express the feelings which you have been hiding." "I am living for you."

Do you know what is this? It's the happiness chemical. I know. I got it because I want you to be always happy. For the first time ever, Rishi has done something right. He has found an educated girl, like Sanya. She has a respectable job at an MNC. My head will always be held high with pride. This calls for a celebration! "I want to be yours." "And I want you to be mine." "Wherever you go," "I want to be with you." "Be it a day or a night," "everything begins and ends with you." "When I am filled with doubt," "I think of you." "I'm in love with you." "I'm in love with you." "I'm in love with you." "I'm in love with you." Mr Lamba, um... Actually... Here is... Darling, are you getting married? Congratulations! Thank you, Mr Lamba. Don't worry, darling. I won't be attending your wedding. Because I know that if I attend your wedding, it will result in a divorce even before it happens. Am I right? Tell me something. Have you told your future partner about your job? Darling, you are about to begin a new chapter, and a new relationship. And the new beginnings should begin with honesty. Mr Lamba, why shoot yourself in the foot? Besides, the nature of this job is really difficult to explain. That’s a devout and pious family. You know, in that household, there are more idols of deities than there are utensils! And 'bhaiji' will never get it. Anyway, it's a matter of a few months. After that, there's nothing to worry about. Darling, the work you are doing... doesn't deserve shame. It's noble work. This is not just a job. This work saves lives. My God! So, this is what you do! Does Rishi know? What if someone finds out? That's the reason, I'm confiding in you. I don't know how to disclose this to Rishi. But for how long can you hide it? Believe me, I'm really tense about this secret life. I don't know if I'm fooling others or myself. The contract will end three months after the wedding. I can't wait for it to get over! I mean it. But after confiding in you, I'm feeling a lot lighter. Thank you. But please, don't tell anyone about it. Pinky promise? By the way, it's a matter of just three months. Find an opportune moment to disclose it to Rishi. Now, please forget about that. So that you can think about your wedding. "When I dance, I sway like a flame." "When I dance, my anklet chimes rhythmically." "When I dance, I sway like a flame." "When I dance, my anklet chimes rhythmically." "When I dance, I sway like a flame."

"You are a special-edition, booming bombshell!" "I am a special-edition, booming bombshell!" "This girl is a booming bombshell!" "I bring a lot of joy with me! Dance with me!" "This girl is a booming bombshell!" Sanya Kalra. Now, you are a part of this home. You must also protect the pride of this home. Of course. Baby! Please, get a condom. A condom? Yes. Why? What do you mean? Won't we need it? Baby, condoms are for lovers. They need to be careful because they are not married. And we are already married-- Baby, does being married mean that we are no longer lovers? Are we not? Of course, we are. So? Why would I wear a raincoat if I want to enjoy the rains? But baby, what if the rainfall results in babies? Then, what? It will lead to drought. Are you okay with that? Don't worry. I've done a lot of research. I'll make sure to turn around before the accident happens. And what if you don't succeed? Let me begin the journey, at least. You can take a pill if I don't succeed. Baby, please get it. Please! Trust me, I will turn around. Please, don't spoil the ambiance. Are you sure? Trust me. Are you sure? Just wait and watch. 'The goddess Laxmi resides at the tip of the hand.' 'The goddess Saraswati resides at the middle part of the hand.' ‘Lord Vishnu resides at the base of the hand.' 'Thus each morning, the hands must be looked at with reverence.' Again? You get these aches and cramps too frequently, Nisha. You should be doing... yoga and deep breathing. I'm already doing that. Let me do it. I'll manage-- -Allow me. But-- -Come on. Give me the other foot. No, I can do it-- I know some acupressure techniques. Come on. Listen, we have newlyweds in the house. Why don't you prepare a special dinner for them? Sure. You can go ahead, I'll do it myself. Yeah. Take a pill or something. Sandhya. Greetings, 'Bhaiji'! Good morning! -Good morning! Good morning! Greetings, Mum and Dad! -Hello, darling. Hello, darling. Nisha, what's that on your forehead? It's nothing. I just have a bit of a headache. Auntie, mum gets these cramps too often. She gets frequent headaches, leg cramps, and stomach aches. Nisha, you should try moonseed water. It improves the immunity. Sure. Listen, both of you will be home for dinner, right? Yes. Yes. I must get going, 'Bhaiji'. Hey! Why are you going by yourself? How will you manage alone? He is about to leave for work. He will drive you to work. It's alright, 'Bhaiji'. I can go by myself. It's not a problem. That way, he can see where the plant is. He can bring your lunch, in case you forget it. Um... I don't wish to bother Rishi. Anyway, he is not ready, and I am late. So-- I am almost done. I'll go with you. Please, don't rush yourself. Sanya, do you know what I think of you? For me, you are a powerful role model. And I can’t allow a role model to use public transport, can I? Certainly, not. Sure, you can. Come on, drop her off at the company gate. Sure. Let's go. You should go together. Bye, Auntie. Please, stop right ahead. What? Vehicles are not allowed inside. Really? -That's it. Yes. Okay, honey. You can leave now. -Here on, I can manage by myself. I rode the bike for so long. Let's just say our goodbyes properly. You can leave now. -Hey! Bye. I'll watch you till you go inside. Aren't you getting late? Okay. Bye. Hello. Please, state your business. Um... Mehta... I have an appointment with Mr Mehta. I'm Sanya. Please, wait here. I'm from 'Dainik Sangram'. Mr Mehta has won, 'the best umbrella brand in Karnal' award. His photo will appear in the newspaper. Sir, you have a visitor named Sanya. She claims that she has an appointment with you. The umbrella brand has won an award. Tell him about the photo! She says that a photo will be featured in a newspaper. A photo of Mr Mehta or the umbrella? Photos of Mr Mehta, the umbrella, and the factory, everything will be photographed and featured! Will it be in colour or in black-and-white? You! The photo will be full-size, in colour, on the front page, along with an interview! Do you want me to do it, or not? Just wait for a moment. Yes, sir. Shall I send her in? Okay, you can go inside. Sure. Sir is here! Good morning, sir. -Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sit down. Thank you, sir. -Thank you, sir. THE SEX CLASS IS HERE TO SPREAD THE JOY Who the hell did this? All the boys will stay here with me. Girls will accompany Ms Zohra to section B. Get up, girls. Move it! Faster. Just note this down. The rest is not important. Sir, what does, 'copulation' mean? It's... um... When a bird sits on top of another bird, that's called, copulation. So, if I sit on top of Chandan, can that be called, ‘copulation’? Don't try and act smart! Just learn it by rote. And it doesn't matter even if you don't do it. Because the questions from this chapter are allotted just two marks. And that too will be optional. But make sure that you learn the digestive system thoroughly. A long-answer question will be allotted to the digestive system. Don't forget, I can play nice, but pray that you don’t have to see my bad side. So, don't test my patience. Now, write it down. What's cooking? Oh, wow! Did mum get a break today? No, it's not that. Just wanted to have something special. Dad! Dad’s culinary skills are on par with a five-star chef! Yes, I can see that. Rishi! I said, no! Looks like the volcano is about to erupt, once again. When he was born, the nurse declared, "Congratulations, Mr Kalra! You've got stress!" What happened, docile little brother? There is a lot of empty space in the shop. I suggested that we could sell some school supplies along with the puja-related goods. There is a school right next door. He just refused. According to him, the puja shop should only sell goods related to puja. I've had enough of it! Why don't you say something? Why do you want to trouble a poor pensioner? I can't even get him to change the channel on the TV! How can I convince him to expand the business? Dad, may I try talking to 'bhaiji'? No. You don't have to do it. Why do you want to play the matador to an angry bull? Dad! 'Bhaiji' is not an angry bull. He is more like a gentle deer. All one needs to know, is how to set a trap! If you are here to advocate Rishi, then please, don't bother. Of course, not. I just wanted to know if you are ready for dinner. Yes, sure. -Okay. Oh! I'm so sorry, 'Bhaiji'! Sorry. Why did you do that to those pages? These are not just pages, it's a medium of knowledge. It can't be disrespected like this. Oh, yes. Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge is believed to favour it. Absolutely! So, just like the stole symbolizes Goddess Durga, do these pages symbolize Goddess Saraswati? What are you implying? Nothing at all. I was trying to say that our belief decides if it's just a statue of stone, or the God. Similarly, these pages can be school supplies, or the sacred goods, based on one's belief. Wow. What a thought! Really amazing. I'll just set the table. Wait. Rishi, Yes? Make a special corner for Goddess Saraswati in the shop. And you can sell school supplies there. Is that okay? Sure. One more thing. Make sure that you count your blessings, every day! You are a lucky man. You are blessed with such a wise partner. Of course! Talk about pearls being cast before swine! Am I right, Dad? Dad? Where did you come from? Auntie, tomorrow, I have a test. Will you help me prepare for it? Yes, sure! Biology? But, your father is a biology teacher. Is he busy with something? No. How can I learn this from him? He is averse to this topic. I thought, why don’t I learn it from you? Is this the one? -No, not this one. It's okay if you teach me just the female part. These two parts are optional in the exam. So, it's okay if I don’t learn these parts. Darling, if it's in the textbook, there must be a good reason for it, right? And even if learning this part is optional now, it will prove to be useful later in life. So, we will learn all of it. Okay? Mum! What happened, Mum? Please get up, Mum! Please! Mum! Please get up, Mum-- -What's that-- Mum! Auntie! -Nisha! What happened? What happened to her? Nisha! -I don't know what happened to her! What is it? -Let me call 'bhaiji'. There is no need to call anybody. Just take me to the hospital. But Nisha-- Please, take me to the hospital. This was the second miscarriage. And there were two abortions in the past. You have to understand, her body is extremely weak at the moment. How can she carry a pregnancy in this state? And if she doesn't want a baby, then the pregnancy should be avoided, right? I have explained this to her many times in the past. Why doesn't she use condoms? The frequent use of emergency pills has badly damaged her body. Please, talk to her. She was lucky this time. But the next abortion... could prove to be fatal for her. Can we see her? -Yes. 'My three kids are a result of unplanned pregnancies.' Hence, I prefer having abortions secretly, over telling my husband about it. There was a lot of interrogation, when I tried confiding in him. 'Why don't you take pills?' 'How will we manage if there is one more mouth to feed?' What can I do, Sanya? If I take the pills, there are so many side effects, like headaches and stomach aches. How can the body retain its strength in this condition? So, why don't you use condoms? I tried. But my husband doesn't approve it. According to him, it's indecent. He thinks, something that needs to be concealed from everybody, is not worth using. And it would really embarrass him if he is seen buying it. A love story is no longer a love story... if the love has evaporated from it. But don't you think-- Sanya. Tell me, have you ever tried discussing this with Rishi? It's the same story for every household. We don't wish to discuss this topic. Even if it costs us our lives. I just can't wait... to turn 45 and hit the menopause. Then, I will be free from these pills and abortions. Don’t say that. Are you feeling better? Please, don't get up. What happened? 'Bhaiji'-- -It's nothing. The monthly problem, that's all. I am okay. Okay. Please, take care. Let me know if you need anything. Take medicines on time. Yes. -I'll just get freshened up. Nisha, why didn't you tell him-- Sanya, don't worry about me. I'll feel better. But... please, don't tell anyone about it. Please. What happened? Your mum is feeling better now, right? Don't be scared. But I am scared, Auntie. This not the first time it happened. And I'm not a kid any more. I understand, what's happening here. What if, what if something happens to mum? Nothing will happen to her. That's not how things should be. What will happen if things continue this way? Auntie, we must find a permanent solution to this problem. Now what happened, darling? Mr Lamba, you were right. This job is not about just chemistry, it does save lives. Henceforth, I pledge to work... at no other place, but here! Mr Lamba, the latest quality report shows 97 percent safety. Now, there will no oops, darling! Stop! Baby, please close your eyes. My eyes? Please. Okay. You want a surprise, right? Yes. Baby, Yes? I love you, right? I... Yes. I love you too. You will do anything for me, right? With my eyes closed? Yeah. Okay. Please, read this for me! What? What's this? Why do you want me to study during the playtime? Please, go through it. Please, baby. This is as vast as the syllabus for the bar exam! Once again, this useless topic-- Baby, this is not a useless topic. Just take a look. Just this once. Just read about the side effects of emergency pills. But it doesn't make any difference to men. You know, I've read that 95 percent men are repelled by condoms, like oil is repelled by water! Hey! Look, that's not entirely true. It does make a difference to men. This thing has its own set of problems. I have heard that it can lead to a system shutdown down there. But-- And to buy a rubber at a shop, in front of everybody-- Please, don't use that term. Just say, condom. Condom. This is truly shocking. Ms Kalpana Chawla managed to conquer the space. She was from Karnal, just like you. And you can't even conquer your fear, and go to a medical store! Baby-- Hey, but... That's why they say, 'Use it, before you choose it.' Have you lost it? Where did you get this... Hey! You! Everybody's home. 'Bhaiji'-- Is he going to come in here? Is he? Of course, not. But if anyone finds it, what will they think? Did you get this from the market? Everyone knows me there. Don't flatter yourself. I didn't buy this at the market. I... I... I got it from the shop at the highway. So, relax. -Sure. And Baby, I have made a decision. Either you will use a condom, or let me use it. Otherwise, you can resort to self-help. Hey! Hey, but-- One more thing. If you want me, you must accept the condom. That's absurd. MADAN MEDICAL SHOP Rishi? What do you need? Um... I need a toothpaste. A toothpaste. Anything else? There are too many mosquitos, right? I'll take a mosquito repellent as well. A mosquito repellent. Anything else? I'll take one of these rubbers. Because people like you use them, such obscene products are manufactured! And I am forced to sell them. Mr Madan, I don't care if it's obscene! Without a condom, I'm an outlaw in my own bedroom! Just give it. Which flavour? Thank you, honey. For accepting my request. Let me read the instructions, I don't want to mess it up. That's easy. Just place it, and then roll it. Really? You seem to know a lot about it. Um... I... Remember the red folder that I gave you? It has the literature explaining everything. But you didn't even bother to read it. Wow. Someone seems to be in the seventh heaven! The carriage horse has transformed into a racehorse! It's an amazing thing. It is, isn't it? You bet! Thank you. Nisha, -Yes? I wanted to discuss something important with you. Tell me. Now, Rishi is using the condoms. I think, you should discuss it with 'bhaiji'. You have lost it. Why are you saying that? Rishi is like water, takes the shape of the container. And his brother is like an acid. You get it, right? Do you wish for troubles in my marriage? That won't happen! All of us will ensure that. Just let go of it, Sanya. How can I let go of it? I have survived it before. Does that mean, you must suffer for the rest of your life? Fine. The day it becomes a norm in Karnal, I will discuss it with 'bhaiji'. Okay? Today, we are going to show you something amazing. Jaya, the genius, are you ready? You bet! When the nocturnal passions overflow, it's followed by the morning-after pill. It's not a just a pill, it's a nightmare for your body! May I? -Yes. Compared to the body, it's just a teeny-weeny tablet. So harmless, right? And if you don't take it, then be prepared to be blessed with a bundle of joy. So ladies, if you want to protect your health, ditch the pill, and go for a condom. And explain it to your better halves as well. What if he doesn't agree? Oh, Meenu! And my dear ladies, equality in the world is a distant dream, at the moment. But we can take a small step in our bedrooms, right? Can't we? Yes, we can! -Yes, we can! If he is a weary traveller, consider yourself to be an endless, flowing river. The river can revitalize the traveller. But, the traveller must follow the path of the river. What if none of this works? In that case, here's the magic spell! 'If you want me, you must accept the condom.' 'If you want me, you must accept the condom.' 'If you want me, you must accept the condom.' Say it, again! -'Accept the condom!' Say it, again! -'Accept the condom!' "Here is my story." "Narrated by yours truly." "It's no fiction." "My story is not an ordinary one." "It happens in every household." "The gossip sprinkles, like rain showers!" "The taunting never stops, even on the home turf." "She'll save you from them." "She'll conceal it all." "She'll make you laugh." "She'll show you dreams." "She is here, to make the dreams come true." "Chhatriwali!" "Chhatriwali!" Can I have a toothpaste? A toothpaste. Too many mosquitos, right? A mosquito repellent, please. A mosquito repellent. A rubber, please. A rubber. A toothpaste, please. A mosquito repellent, please. A rubber. A rubber. A rubber. A rubber, please. A rubber. A rubber. A rubber! Hello, there. Hello, there! Hello. How are you? I'm doing great. Can I have a toothpaste? A toothpaste. There are too many mosquitos. I'll take a mosquito repellent as well. A mosquito repellent. Anything else? What else can be there? That'll be all. My God! So many helmets! All at once. What the hell is going on here? What can we do? Our wives are being adamant. If we wish to be with them, using a condom is the only way. Just quit it! 'We want to be loved!' I am fed up with these people! Nonsense! Listen to me, carefully! And get rid of these masks of obscenity! Just take them off. Do it, now! So, your wives are holding the reins of your lives, and all of you are dancing to their tune! Really? That's it. Enough with the theatrics! Put an end to it! And remember, the day you stop obliging them, this drama will come to an end. We will stop dancing to their tune! Who's with me? We are! -We'll do it! Well done. Well done. Listen to me. The men of Karnal did not start this battle. But we will, bloody hell, finish it! Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Where were you? When you don't get what you want at home, you are forced to try outside, right? This pill-fiasco has broken the hearts of our husbands! Yes! -They are seeking solace outside! It's just smoke without fire! Fire or no fire, we don't wish to risk it! Who's with me? That's right. -We don't want to risk it. Meenu, you should understand it, at least. Tell me, have you witnessed your husband being unfaithful to you? Have you? I haven't witnessed it, but I've got a whiff of it, alright! Listen, you can experiment all you want, in your own bedroom. Don't try and ruin our relationships. Absolutely, right! -She is right! Just hear me out-- -Henceforth, we will make sure that our husbands get what they want, and how they want it. Let's get out of here. -Let's go. But... Don't worry. We will find a way. Throughout their lives, these poor women have been conditioned to comply with the wishes of their husbands. It's a long way before there is any equality. I don't know what to do, Jaya. But firstly, I must confess everything to Rishi. It's getting difficult to manage it. And now, Rishi has been using the condoms. I'm sure, I can succeed in explaining my situation to him. 'Rishi, I want to tell you that...' 'Rishi, I want to tell you that...' Rishi-- -I missed you so much! Rishi-- -These two days felt like two years. Baby-- -I passed your home twice, Baby, listen to me-- and was wondering if I should go inside. Baby, listen to me-- -I too have a lot to tell you-- Baby, please! Baby, I need to discuss something important with you-- 'Mr Kalra!' 'Come out, Mr Kalra!' 'Mr Kalra!' -'Come out!' 'Mr Kalra!' -'Come out!' Mr Kalra! Please, come out! Mr Madan? What's this? What happened? You should be answering that question. You... Why don't you come inside? We can discuss it, peacefully. I'm not going to set foot in your home! What's the matter? Please, tell me. Your question is truly surprising. Because you have turned this city into a red-light district. What do you mean? I mean... I mean, look at this. KARNAL GETS ITS FIRST EVER FEMALE CONDOM-TESTING OFFICER I don't know for how long she is into this business. I started wondering, why this city is plagued with so much obscenity, lately! Somebody is trying to malign my family. There seems to be some misunderstanding. Sanya works at an umbrella factory. Is that so? -Tell them, Sanya. An umbrella! Come on, tell them. You work for Mehta Umbrellas, right? Tell them. -That's right. She works for Mehta Umbrellas... um... 'Bhaiji', I-- -Quiet. That's enough. 'Bhaiji', you are a biology teacher, right? But she has been giving practical lessons! She has been brainwashing our wives! She is the reason behind our marital problems! Absolutely! -He is right! Mr Kalra, our acquaintance goes way back. Your family is known to be cultured. Your family has been dealing in puja-related goods! We are spammed with promotional messages of your shop, containing images of deities! And look at the scandal happening in your home! This, really? Your family has always been exemplary for us. It breaks my heart to see your family reputation being slandered. I apologize to you on behalf of Sanya. I assure you, it won't happen again. An assurance. An umbrella factory, it seems. Let's go. Let's go. -Let's get out of here. 'Bhaiji'... I... Except Rishi and Sanya, everyone else will go inside. But, Son-- Dad, I'm taking care of it, right? Nisha, please, take everyone inside. Rishi... 'I held you in high regard.' I took pride in your work, and loved telling everyone that you are a quality-control head in an MNC. I believed that you are doing a respectable job. Is this what you are doing? Have you ever thought, how your actions will affect Mini? 'Bhaiji', it's not what you think. I haven't done anything wrong. Besides, my work doesn't involve any human contact. I really am a quality-control head. It's just that... Rishi, you have been using condoms, right? Please, say something. For how long have you been doing this job? It began before we got married. So, you were doing this job, when we first met. Since that day, you have been lying to me, every single day! Like a fool, I have been dropping you off at the gate of that factory. I made sure that I waited there, till you went inside. I believed that was an umbrella factory. And all of it was a big, fat lie! You have deceived me, Sanya. -Rishi... Me, as well as my family! I thought, we bring out the best in each other. But you have destroyed everything! You have been lying to my face! Rishi! Rishi, please. I'm really sorry, Rishi. But I couldn't have told you the truth, then. Please, believe me. Today, I was about to tell you-- Rishi! Rishi, please. 'Bhaiji', I am not doing anything illegal or criminal. The work I do, is extremely necessary! It saves lives. It's noble work. Sanya, every household has a few limits and boundaries. And you have crossed that limit. If you wish to continue living under my roof, then you will have to quit that obscene job. My work is not obscene! But you-- Rishi, visit her factory tomorrow, and hand over her resignation letter. I'll have a word with the school management. She is an educated girl, she can work as a teacher at the school. Is that okay? It's decided, then. Listen, I'm sure that it will be forgotten in no time. Make a few gift hampers of puja-related goods, to be distributed among our neighbours. Let's host an event of devotional music, and make sure that everyone is invited. Everything will be fine, okay? Sanya! 'Bhaiji', there is nothing wrong with my work. The fault lies with your point of view. I-- -Rishi. Let her go. She needs some time to cool off. "Last night, my heart wept a lot." There was no respite, even for a moment!" "You have hurt it." "My heart is broken." "You have hurt it." "My heart is broken." "I tried explaining it." "That it's better if some memories aren't cherished." "I'm feeling stifled." "My heart is broken." "You have hurt it." "My heart is broken." "I called your name, many times." "But my voice was drowned out by the cacophony." "Many love stories bloomed." "But my story could not blossom." "Nobody should face a predicament like this!" "The way you abandoned me." "My home is forsaken." "My heart is broken." "You have hurt it." "My heart is broken." This is serious! How could you not tell me about it? Why? You took up that job, and now, it's all water under the bridge. However, that job... must not wreck your marriage. Mum, you always prayed for a miracle, right? Consider that a miracle appeared in the form of my job. The education fees for Jaya and Nikky, as well as, the repair work for the leaking roof, the motor scooter, and the solution to all our problems, was possible because of this job. Mum, I am not quitting this job, under any circumstances. And... they won't let me do it, while living under their roof. So, I have made up my mind. But-- LET THE EVIL EYE BE WARDED OFF Is this the backyard door? Not sure. Let's find out. I... I am, Ratan Lamba. I am... Mrs Dhingra. How can I help you? Um... Does Sanya live here? Darling, honestly, I had no inkling about it. Sattu was jealous of you. That moron was bribed to leak your story to a newspaper. Sanya, for the past four years, I have been working in this factory. All along, I was doing such a crucial work, but I always depreciated it. You made me realize something important. I wish, I was told about it as an adolescent, that a condom is the real lifesaver. That information would have saved my wife from hospitalisation. Mr Lamba, Monu is absolutely right. The problem is not Nisha's silence, or the shame 'bhaiji' feels about this subject. Nobody cared to explain things to them in their adolescence. How can they have the awareness, all of a sudden? That's the reason you could not find a quality-control officer. Initially, I too had turned down the job. That's the reason I could not convince Nisha and the other ladies. All the while, I was pruning the foliage. But the problem is at the roots. So, I must begin working at the root level. What does that mean? What do you have in mind? I mean, nothing too drastic. But I will make sure that Mini learns biology from her father. I like this quality about the young generation. They are extremely brave. 'Sir,' 'I just have one point.' The chapter about reproduction and safe sex is mandatory in the school curriculum. So, why does it have an optional status in exams? You know that it's an important thing. At the very least, this chapter should be allotted a long-answer question. Sir, this measure is necessary. It will ensure that the teachers explain this chapter in detail, and the students learn it, thoroughly. I am well aware of your exploits! But Karnal is not famous for your actions. It is famous because of Ms Kalpana Chawla. This city is known for the knockout wrestlers it produced. In the last 25 years, this institute has produced nine wrestlers competing at the national level. But you... Couldn't you find any other profession? You chose to be a condom tester! I wish to know something else. In the last 25 years, how many girl students from this institute, have undergone abortions? I hope you know, what an abortion means. It means, 'a deliberate termination of human pregnancy'. The answer is, more than 300 girls. Out of them, 54 girls miscarried, and 12 girls could not survive. What do these numbers-- -Look! Why fix something, that's not even broken? You may leave now. Please, leave. Check it out! Your support has boosted my morale. KARNAL PLAYGROUND Ma'am, Ma'am, I had a few questions for you. Tell me. Um... I mean, you won't tell anyone about it, right? No, I won't. Ma'am, last week, I had gone out with a friend, to watch a new film. So, we had some snacks. Ma'am, I mean... We kissed as well. So, my question was, I mean... like... When two people share a kiss, can it result in a pregnancy? No. No! Monty, you can ask as many questions, without hesitation or fear. Got it? And tell all your friends that I'll be glad to answer all the questions about this topic. All kinds of questions? You bet. And nothing discussed here will leave this kiosk. Thank you, ma'am. -Okay? Bye. Bye, ma'am. Come on. Let's go back. -But why? No. -Come on. Hey! -Hello! Don't worry! Come on. -Let's go back. Come on, guys! Come on! Just come! Go ahead. Ask her! Ma'am, Ma'am, what is the function of the ovary? Ma'am, what is the function of the uterus? Ma'am, what is the function of the testicles? When does the hymen break? Ma'am, what's a vagina? You can laugh about it. That too is necessary. But it's more important to have information. Vagina is as important as any other part of your body, or another organ. And it is as important to understand the function of that-- What the hell is happening here? Get out of here! Just scram! Let's go. -Come on. Why are you being so stubborn? These things are too inappropriate to be explained to adolescents! The right to drive, the right to vote, and the right to marry is granted only at 18 years of age. And the legal age for drinking is 25! What could be the reason? Because children lack the restraint, and the sensibility required to make these decisions. And you are explaining, 'how to make babies', to these kids! Why don't you file a petition about this? Let these kids cast their votes at 15. Let them drive the cars. But then, accidents will be inevitable. You are right, 'Bhaiji'. Absolutely, right. These children don't have the sensibility, or the restraint. But tell me something. The bodily changes begin to happen at ages 12 to 13, right? Can you stop that? No, right? It's obvious that the children will be curious about those changes. That curiosity will lead them to be hasty, and to try doing things by themselves. And that's the reason it is more important that they have the required information, at this age. They will make grave mistakes if they remain ignorant. And having the right information at this age, will save them from harbouring wrong notions, as well as committing mistakes. It's the need of the hour. So, I am going to continue with this class. Rishi, you are missing Sanya, right? Hey! You should be flaunting it, not hide it! You are missing her, right? She lied to me. To all of us. Lies weaken the relationships, not strengthen them. Do you remember when you were a kid, the factory I worked in had closed down. After that, I drove a truck for a year. Dad, are you comparing driving a truck, to the job Sanya is doing? That's some job! What if I tell you, I didn't drive a truck, but worked as a butcher? How would you feel? My work involved slaughtering goats, every single day. Do you think our family could have digested this piece of news? No, right? Our family is an ordinary, religious family. Son, it's not necessary that the truth is always right, and a lie is always wrong. The intent behind any truth or a lie decides, whether it is right, or wrong. That time, I chose to lie. For you. And for our family. Hey! Aren't you a businessman? Try reassessing the situation, then. Amidst this biting cold, when the entire city is sleeping peacefully, she is fighting this battle all alone. And despite all the humiliation, she is unfazed. Don't you agree that her point is worth considering, at least? My friend, I am left with very little life to live, but you have your entire life ahead of you. I think, you are wise enough to figure out the rest. The eggs are formed in the ovaries. Okay? And the eggs mature in the ovaries and... She is the one! The drama queen! -Hey! Let's go. -Come on, out. What happened, sir? -Out! What happened, sir? -Let's go! Take her. Where am I being taken? -Let's go! Hurry up! -Why am I being arrested, sir? Come on! -Please, tell me. Be quiet and get inside the vehicle. Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Just get in. -I'll inform the media! Hey! -I'm telling you! Parents censor even the television content for their kids! And you are showing them obscene pictures! There is nothing obscene here. Please, hear me out-- -Get inside. Come on. -There's a misunderstanding! Just hear me out once, sir. -We know our job. Come on! -Sit down. Please, don't push me. Let's go. -Hey, quiet! Just hear me out once, please. Sir, please. Rishi, what are you doing? Where are you going? I am going to bail Sanya out of jail. She has left you, after a slap in your face. She humiliated our family in front of everybody. And here you are! Bailing her out, with our money! She left our home. She didn't leave, 'Bhaiji'. We threw her out of the home. We humiliated her. You got her arrested for tutoring a couple of kids! Rishi, you reap, what you sow. And you are following her footsteps. I'm doing this for your own good. Rishi, listen to me. Don't ever forget that you have this money, as well as the shop, because of me. You are absolutely right. You have done a lot for me. And I am grateful for that. But I can't abandon my wife to rot in jail! I am going to bail Sanya out of jail. As for the shop, here you go. You can have it. Are you giving up the shop? What will you do for a living? You are a high-school dropout! And nobody will hire a high-school dropout! I'll manage it, 'Bhaiji'. I'll survive, somehow. It's true that I'm a high-school dropout. But you are the illiterate one! Are you here to file another complain for lying to you? I'm sorry. I'm here to apologize. I didn't stop you, when you left. I let you go. I didn't support you. Please, forgive me. I finished reading the literature from the red folder you gave me. Now, I have come to understand everything. Really? What is it? I have understood that when things were going well, I loved you a lot. But now, I realize that one needs more love and support, when things aren't going well. Think again. Aren't you, 'the king of devotion'? I don't-- I don't wish to be the reason, for you to get expelled from the family-WhatsApp groups. It's no longer the king of devotion. Now I prefer, 'the king of lust'. Remember, what I said? We bring out the best in each other. So, our union would be nothing less than a blast. "My prayers have been answered." "The colossal gaps have been mended." "My life had lost its colour without you." "It's rosy, once again." "The time belongs to us." "The cherished memories are back." "Every road and every turn," "crossed paths with you." "My heart is transformed!" 'Urinary bladder, prostate gland, rectum, 'and penis.' 'And it's pronounced, 'pee-nus', and not, 'pe-nis'.' 'Okay?' 'And the female reproductive organs are, left and right ovaries.' 'And as I explained,' 'the uterine lining disintegrates,' 'when the egg is not fertilized.' And that's followed by bleeding through the vagina, every month. The bleeding happens through which part of the body? Through the vagina. -Through the vagina. That's right. Rishi. What the hell is happening here? 'Bhaiji', good to have you here. The children have a lot of doubts related to biology. Who can explain things to them, better than you? Your teacher is here. You can ask him about your queries. How many times do I have to say it, for you to understand? She is incorrigible! And you are advocating her! And students, do you wish to get barred from exams this year? Get up, right now, and get back to school! Otherwise, I'll make sure your grades bear the cost of this. Son, all of them will leave. But explain something to me. What is, 'copulation'? I too have a question. What does, 'STI' stand for? Sir, how does one protect oneself from AIDS? Sir, what are the side effects of morning pills? Sir, which are the safe days of the month, to avoid a pregnancy? Just stop talking! Has everyone lost it? Mum and Dad, how could you get deceived by her? Do you realize, how all of this will affect my daughter? Do you? Nisha, just take Mini inside with you. No. Not today. I won't budge from here, till you answer my question. The human body... is capable of enduring, how many abortions, exactly? I have suffered two abortions, and two miscarriages. I could never muster up the courage to confide in you. Do you know why? You think that rubbing my temples, massaging my feet, and taking me out, is pampering. But you never even made an attempt to find out, what my real problems are. You have been turning a blind eye to everything. You must think that you love me a lot. But that's not true. I am just an obligation to you. The other day, mum had to be hospitalised. That day, I was really scared, Dad. What if, after getting married, I have to face a similar situation? Won't that scare you, Dad? 'Bhaiji', are you going to ignore that question, as well? Of course, it will scare me. It will frighten the life out of me. In our home, there are more idols of deities than there are utensils. And... amidst that, I forgot to cherish my own guardian angel. Please, forgive me. Sanya, not just for our home, you are a role model for all of Karnal! 'This story began at a household.' 'Now that it has gained momentum, it is going to go a long way.' 'All the answers were right in front of us, but the right questions were never asked.' 'Now, there are questions about theories,' 'and there are answers explaining their practical applications.' 'The discussions are shaping up in the backyards, as well as in the neighbourhoods of the city.' 'This chain reaction is in motion, and it's far from over!' 'After all, it's just chemistry!' I'm Afreen Begum. My name is Savita Devi. My name is Seema Shinde. I am working here for the past five years, and my mother works here as well. 'Earlier, everyone was hesitant to talk about this topic.' 'But now, everyone realizes the importance of this subject.' Why should one be hesitant? It's noble work. Everyone in my family knows about my work, and they are really proud of me. I am going to continue working here. What's there to hide? It's noble work.
