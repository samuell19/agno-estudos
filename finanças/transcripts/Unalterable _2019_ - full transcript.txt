Why did you do that? You ... what are you talking about? I mean Sang-Gon. I can not do anything. Chairman Kang forced me. Do you know. Please understand. Then why did you run away? I actually... Doing embezzlement. I'm afraid they'll find out I'm embezzling money from the company. I went to China for a few months. Brother, I have a family. I'm sorry this time. If you don't believe it, you can confirm. This. Listen to recordings and find out. Really, really. I won't hold you accountable. From now on Don't ever contact the oldest brother. Oh, oh. Understand. Don't ever call you. Really. Let him go. Important files have been backed up. Shit, this guy didn't answer the phone. What happened? You all know good city business, right? Good city? What is that? There are rumors that you have invested a lot. You're still acting here. Who is acting? Good way to make money. Of course I will pay attention and invest money. Not. Those who don't believe will lose. Anyway, I quit. I'm going to work. You two do what you want. I have to go. You're running away. This bastard. Police guarded the main door. They can't take our picture and enter it into the search list? The back door, yes. Ah, shit. The state says gangs are one of the two biggest crimes. Open your eyes and make a fuss. Prosecutors, police, these people are always looking for opportunities to catch us. There is no way we will survive. I've been in this business for a long time. I'll send the address. Hey, are you all right? Wake up. Bring me a towel. Yes. - You are okay? - Yes. Let go! It's been a while since I went to school. I remember sports days. Sang-gon You want to be ganster with me? After you join the gang, you are a gangster. Once Brother, always brother. I wondered who else I could trust. I think about you. Sis, I respect you. I want to be a handsome man like you. If you are willing, I will be your handsome brother. But... Can I bring my brother? Can they be trusted? Of course. You can call them brothers. Brothers together. Well, your brother is my brother. Come to Seoul, I'll take care of you. Shall we go? Of course, we all go together. A man's life is balance. You must have fun. - I'll tell the chairman. - Cheers. We're talking about something. Please be quiet. I don't care, let's have a drink. Let's drink. Cheers, everyone! Cheers! Let's drink. Do it again. Lift it, lift it, come on. Cheers to us. Cheers. I'm going to the restroom. This is Eldest Brother. How about a little calm? You want to fight. Did you drink too much? Yes, I drank too much today. Dammit. I thought you were exercising. I didn't expect you to fight. I didn't do anything wrong. What do you think is wrong? What do you want? There is no. Am I not a good father? So what? I won't go the wrong way. You think you can get away with being a gangster? Maintain brotherhood like brothers. Can live in luxury. Gangsters are gangsters. What do you want to do like that? I don't care what you call it. This is the path I chose. I'll take the consequences. Son. The law cannot drag you alone. So to get your brother out ... The lawyers are on Cheong Wa Dae's side. Forgive me. Living like this may exceed your capabilities. I promise I will not trouble you. Will not happen again. Wish you good health always. Damn headache. Where the hell is this? What do you want, you bastard? Are you crazy? I want to talk to you. Brother? Brother what? Sang-gon. So you are her brother? I am your chairman, Kang Chang-wan What? What is this? You took your brother's things ... ... for yourself. Shit, I didn't know about that. Besides the building managed by Sang-gon. Everything is finished. What's this got to do with me? Besides, he's your right hand. Nonsense. I'm left-handed. Check everything and sell everything that can be sold. Why do you have Director Yoon's tape? That's why he doesn't answer the phone. Since when have you been watching me? Wow, this ... I, Kang Chang-wan, am facing a major crisis. Right? Even for siblings who clean your shit You can't do that. I am so sorry. That is all. Nyahlah! I told you. Get lost, you bastard. Dammit. Please go. Today is the last time I called you brother. Cheol-hoi, take you to the hospital. Kwon Sang-gon brought down Kang Chang-wan. Take his place. Sang-gon? Hey, catch the four-eyed boy in the middle. Next to a pillar in a black suit. Not the four-eyed man in front of him. Get him out quickly. You scared me. What is this? Oldest brother. Why? We just got news that Kwon Sang-gon kicked Kang Chang-wan. I go. That's cruel. cruel. What happened? Is this good or bad for us? Must be a good thing. Why and what? There was a rumor he wanted to leave this circle. They have stolen all the organization's money. Is it true? Uncle, are you dad's friend? Jae-Rim, not a friend. Return to your seat. He's dad's friend. Aigoo, are you Jae-Rim? You're a big girl. I enjoy being with my brothers. His father's personality. Stubborn and fearless. Tae-gyoo, stubborn, and he's not afraid. Not brothers, but very similar. We are all brothers, so we look alike. Sang-gon. I just hope Tae-gyoo has a safe job. There is nothing to ask for, apart from living an ordinary life. I will die without regrets. Mom, we're eating. How can you say something like that? Auntie, don't say that. You have to accept Tae-gyoo's kindness. Let us eat. This is delicious. You don't like him? Not. This is my first time here ... I'll invite you more often. Be fine with me. Of course. I will take care of you. I'll take good care of Tae-gyoo. I would be happy if my brothers were happy too. Is the party going well? Sorry, I didn't think it would be this long. Why didn't you call me? Kidding. Kidding. Can't joke around. Has no sense of humor. In that case, people don't know you're an athlete. Why hasn't it changed? You praise me, right? Do you think so? Happy. Ah yes, now you're the new boss. Because you are here. Run the old business and the Joella Do Family will join in. Chang-Wan didn't think about it anymore. We also want to expand our business with new businesses. Well, that's a good thing. Let's do it right .. The business looks good. But if it fails. This could be the end. This is huge. You can't play without having capital. If it weren't for a good organization like the two of us ... ... it's hard to be afraid. Director Yoon Dong-ryeol is here. Now I'm going to start explaining. Jiangnan Commercial Buildings and Residential Buildings. Sales business plan. On the left is Yangji station, the life of company employees. Several competent construction companies will be interested in this place. Everything for a good city. Drink up. Sis, toast. Sis, don't do this. I'll be happy You're a soldier, right? Of course, Sis. I'm a Marine. Seriously. Try clenching your fists. You got the hands of an asshole. You're not a gangster, are you? Of course not, Sis. You're a gangster, right? I told you it wasn't the Gang. Isn't that right, you bastard? This guy is too weird, replace it with another. Take it easy, and hang out with the people in your hometown. I know my brother, so I understand. But they don't understand. He will think you are just a usurper. I'll be careful. Take care of the brothers. Currently, loyalty is useless. The result is still money. Money making rules. Become the boss. I understand. You know I like you, right? thanks. Director Kwon, we don't have anything. The director couldn't help it. Please. Please. What should I do? Should I go straight to him? He said there was nothing more that could be done. Where's Cheol-hoi? Return with Sang-gon. Everyone looks the same. I didn't expect to see you like this again. You think I'll quit? You're not doing right. You still think of me as a brother? Shame me like that in front of my brothers. Take me away. Have you ever thought about what you did? Don't be silly. The money you have. This is all my money. Just because you can follow me and have fun with me. That's why you're with me, is n't it, you bastard? If it weren't for me ... ... You're just a punk from a small town. Go. If I knew you were like this ... ... I won't follow you. I am different from you. Village bastard. You're worse than a bastard, jerk. This is hard, right? Who is the president who cannot increase the purchase price? This, this. Just hold on. Come on. Let's have a good life. If the good city is successful. I'm going to invest heavily in you. Wake up. Understand. Let's stay together. I'll leave it to you. What are you waiting for? Get ready. I am home. Been working hard. President. Yes, what is up? I haven't got my pay this month. When you get this month's salary ... ... I'll put flowers. Got it, right? Go. Sis, today's problem is not a good city. My brothers' allowance has run out. Then we will give up on the good city. Sorry to call you this late. Can I help you? I have an appointment with the President. Have you made an appointment in advance? Yes. Sang-gon. Long time no see. Let's talk inside. Wait a minute, I'll be back after finishing work. Soon. OK. Cheol-hoi got the car ready. Let's go back. Wait for my call. Can't you wait this long? Compared to the time I waited for you ... ... this is nothing Seeing you are so busy, I'll come back later. You finally felt it? You can't be a gangster without money. You were in charge of the demolition business first. Even though the scale is small. But maybe a little difficult for you. I know it... You're just ... Are you healthy? Your mother can live without me. But I can't live without you. You have to take care of your body. Yes. I will visit mom soon. Are you going back to the hospital? Get some rest before you go. Yes. Seeing her only son. Very stubborn. I just feel stupid. Even so, my son came here. I feel quite happy. You wanna go home? Go to Seocho-dong. Yes. Sorry. It is okay. Luckily, I haven't had dinner yet. Aren't you asking other people? Not. Today, I haven't finished work. Have to work overtime. I heard him mentioning you. Ah, ya. Thank you, brother-in-law. What brings you here? I thought you hated this area. Just ... miss you. - Suddenly? - Yes Good people like you, so boring Also very interesting. Does he do the same to his siblings? Not really. I shouldn't have asked. Will nothing happen? No, come here. I want to have dinner with you. Forgive me. I have to go. We have to be back by 8:00. Finish eating, before you leave. I've eaten a lot. We will talk again later. Enjoy. Sis, can I ask a question? What? I don't know what work Brother-in-law does? I know you two have been dating since college. A civil servant. A civil servant. If you're a civil servant here ... Without realizing it, like this. A student who exercises physical sports to death. Cheol-hoi, I hope you didn't tell anyone about this. I'll tell everyone if I have to. Until then, keep it a secret from the brothers. Brother. I can't disappoint Dad. This time, we have to get it right. Brother. It's me, Kwon Sang-gon We are already past a period of crisis. But the hospital says it takes time to observe. Your father is eager to meet you. So... I won't see you till I'm dying. Until now. What else can I do now? Forgive me. Do you eat regularly? Cheers. The number you are calling cannot be reached. Brother. Where do you go? If you don't come now, I'll run out of wine. What are you doing? Why is wine so expensive? Take the President out. Don't drink if you don't have money. Where are you going? Where are you going? What an uneducated ape Seeking death. Why? What do you want? What do you see? Finish your drink and get out of here. What happened? This child. You're too young to be educated. You're nothing. Then who are you? What are you like when you get old? This child. Isn't he one of Sang Gon's men? Climb using Kwon Sang-gon. Sang-gon. This bastard is getting tougher. This bastard treats seniors like trash. No wonder he's pulling his boss down. Bunch of bastards. You laugh. Dammit.

How many clubs did you take over? In total there are 50. I took over 5 nightclubs. Ten people in each shop. Well. Cheol-hoi. From now on, we must change. Never use a weapon.

I have Cha Joon-yeong. Brother is angry. Brother Sin Ha-jin goes to sort things out with the owner and goes to jail. Brother Kim Geon, go to the casino where he used to make trouble. I was being played by the Chairman. After that.. - Come here to get back to work. - Yes. Knife or prison. Everything is alright. But I was crushed to death by a list of tasks sent by the government. Shit, I get really pissed off when these people come to say hi. Dad has another mission. I used to be afraid of the police. What I fear the most now is duty. What is this? You gave it to me too? This is not a to-do list. Small appreciation from the younger generation. Use it to save your pride. Do not be sad. Kang Chang-wan looks really good to people. If you treat sister like you well. Oh, idiot. I said you ... ... stay alive and don't end with me. Besides, I'm thinking of going back to my hometown. Thank you for the money. Go. thanks. You treat me as a senior. Please come and see me. Looks like you're the only one talking about loyalty Have you seen Kim Geon? I've seen him once. He returned home. Did you give him money? Just a little help. After taking the kid's money, I couldn't interfere anymore. Are you all right, sis? Yes, I am doing okay. Sang-gon. I'm a little embarrassed to say. But I want to ask one thing. Please tell me, sis. Help me find my daughter. I thought you lived with your brother-in-law. She came with divorce papers. I lost my temper. She cuts contact and runs away from home. But... ... my daughter doesn't go with her mother. Living alone. Can you find it? And take good care of him. This one? I will use it Who are you? You must be Sin Mi-yeong? Is it permissible for a lawyer to illegally detain students Your father's name is Sin Ha-jin, right? I do not know. You don't even know your father's name? This is none of your business, ma'am. Your father asked me for help. Do you know my father? How can a lawyer know a gangster? Because my husband is also a gangster. Oh, God. What is there to show off? I'm not showing off. I'm telling the truth. I won't ruin my life just because my husband is a gangster What do you have to say? Where do you live? Do you live with runaway children? You're investigating me. Lawyer. Isn't that illegal? I know the law better than you. Do not be arrogant. You think I wanna do that? Then get out of that damn place and come to my house. How can a lawyer talk dirty? Should not? because my husband is a gangster? Sang-gon. How are you? Well. How are you? He is Director Cha's representative. I'm Kwon Sang-gon. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Joon-yeong. Representative Cha signed a $ 2 billion investment. Attorney Han decided to invest one billion dollars. The Chinese market is huge and promising. So I decided to invest. How? Because this is the business that Director Kwak and Lawyer Han are promoting . So do it. Well. Will get great results. Nice to meet good colleagues. President Kwon also joined. This makes me even happier. In that case... ... I'm counting on you, President Kwon. Please. Brother. Think again. I don't think this is good. He is the one who looks after my father to the end. Attorney Han also invested 1 billion dollars. The person named Cha Joon-yeong invested 2 million dollars. I don't think it's a problem. What are you doing? The president is here. Ms. Tae-gyoo ... It.. Tae-gyoo doesn't know yet, right? Let me ask. Halo. What? What are you talking about, you bastard? Tae-gyoo. Hmm. What did you say? What happened? Cha Joon-yeong is a gangster from Busan. So he's a gangster. But what's wrong? He came to the shop to cause trouble. He said he wanted to get back the 100 million that the head of the Kwak department took. Where is Director Kwak? Fled to China after getting investment money. They say you're the mastermind. With $ 2 billion, it would be better if Director Kwak could make money. If you can't produce ... ... I just wanna get my capital back. I'll take care of it. I will meet him. Good shot. Very nice. You guys are in cahoots. I said I can't. Is it true? And I can't allow it. I told you. You have to pay me back. Alright, alright, I won't take flowers, okay? I said I can't. Senior. I'm not your senior brother. Give me the money now. If you don't call me senior brother, what should I call you? Calling you directly? Are you crazy? Stop right there. You village people. And who are you? I will go. Cha Joon-yeong. If you keep looking for trouble, I will declare war. Dammit. What would you do? What else can we do? Let's do it first. Should I call the police? Between gangsters. What's with the police? That's so mean. Didn't the kid say anything? I hold it for you. I'm Cha Joon-yeong. I heard your men were seriously injured. It is not good. So, why sacrifice your men? Why don't you just pay for it? Who are you, a gangster? You and I have to end it. I'll find time to go to your company. How is your company? Either you pay back $ 2 billion or your company dies and goes bankrupt. Wait for me, Kwon Sang-gon Is that Cha Joon-yeong? Cheol-hoi. We live with dignity. Getting into trouble. Give them $ 2 billion to solve this problem. If this continues. We don't have to deal anymore. Kak. Thinking about the tremendous sadness for the family. A little hard to bear. But this is the fate of a gangster. I will set a time to deal with Cha Joon-yeong. Do not interfere. Well. I can go to jail alone. I will set a time to deal with Cha Joon-yeong. Do not interfere. What would you do? Is not it? You will do the same. Even you can't survive. Brother. Something's wrong, right? You want to bear it alone. Last time, ten years. If you come back this time, you can never get out. Can't just watch. So, yes. I decided to do it myself. Killed someone. Then it disappeared. Yeong-jae. Sorry. I can't take care of you anymore, so ... Last saw you. I can't take care of you anymore. Sorry. Where are you going? May I ask? Family problem. I can take you there in my car. No, it's better if I go alone. Didn't someone come to you? See you again. It is okay. You're busy. Do not worry. I will tell you before doing it. Oldest brother. This is not something you can do. I can do it. As long as I decide. Yeong-jae. If you worry about your brother ... No, that's not all. Our brother. You have to be the faceless boss forever, so ... ... You can't leave a trace. Cha Joon-yeong is coming to Seoul tomorrow for his birthday party. He will go to the woman's house as soon as he arrives in Seoul. Just fix it there. You have to be the faceless boss forever, so ... ... You can't leave a trace. Brother. The next generation ... Sorry I have to go alone. Detective Kang. We didn't hear from Joon-yeong's brother. I thought someone from Jeolla did it. Would I stay like this if there was evidence? Hah? Nobody touches our brothers except them. There was time for witnesses and no other suspicions. Then who did it? Maybe another organization. Who is that? I don't understand what you're asking? Who touched Cha Joon-yeong? Is that you? Yeong-jae. Yeong-jae. Who is Yeong-jae? The child that Tae-gyoo knows very well in prison and cares for. But... Why did he touch Cha Joon-yeong? Cheol-hoi, tell me something. I wanna throw it all away and do it myself. So when setting up organizational circles. I just found out the kid is there. I thought about stopping it. But he himself was ready. I can't think of anything but Young-jae. So... So ... I told him how. I have no choice but to protect brother. Forgive me. Where is the kid? Where is the kid? ...Die. To me ... a child who does n't even know who I am. If I don't beat Kang Chang-wan. Then we won't be criticized by people from Mokpo. He said he had beaten his predecessor. Then Sang-goo won't get angry and get into trouble like that. Then Sang-goo and Tae-gyoo shouldn't have died, right? If I don't say I'll beat Cha Joon-yeong. You're not going to do this for me. How many more people will die for me? Brother. Too many people died. Their family ... ... will spend his life in tears and blood. It's my fault for not being able to protect my brother. Not your fault. It all started because of me. Cheol-hoi. If I remain a gangster. How many more deaths will I see before my eyes? Help her. Uncle, why are you drinking so much? Are you okay? Dammit. What are you doing? Oh, of course I want to take you home. I need to know where your house is, so I can take you home, uncle. Give me your KTP. Let's find out for ourselves. Is he out of his mind? Go. I'm not in the mood to deal with you Why? Are you annoyed? Is that why you drink so much? Get out of here, you bastard. That bastard tried to talk to me. Shit. Hey, are you the chairman? What are you doing, Chairman? Your men were badly beaten. You bastard. Shit. Hi Hi Hi! You need money? If you need money, make money, motherfucker. Is that all you can do as a man? Looks like you know how to fight. You want to be a gangster? You want me to take you? Take care of your pride. Want to live more in style, right? You can't do anything. But you want to live like a brother, don't you? You want to be a gangster? Not good. That's no good, motherfucker. You just got home. You have eaten? I guess you didn't eat what I made for you. No, go back to sleep. Let's eat. We live to eat. You don't accompany him? He said he wanted to go alone. Sorry, brother-in-law. I didn't serve you well. Not. These are all his decisions and choices. Right or wrong, that's part of it. Of course ... don't live for money. Take care of your men. You will be fine. Thank you all this time. I'm glad you're here. Very delicious. Good? Can you be happy like this? Yes, Miss Jeong Min-jeong I think he woke up. You go first. I'll catch up with you when I'm done. Fine, I'll be there. Eldest brother is looking for this person. I'll take this to the grave. For all of us. As my father said, ... ... if there weren't any gangsters. Will I be happy? What to do? Sang-gon, Sang-gon.… What to do? Sang-gon.
