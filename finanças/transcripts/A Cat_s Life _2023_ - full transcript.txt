-Him, that's my cat. (*) His name is Rroû. I'm going to tell you our story. A story that made both of us grow. Hey, you were hungry. So? Shh. Their mother hasn't come for several days. Do you think she abandoned them? She would never do that. Look how hungry they are. We really need to take them in. Come on. Here, little kitty. Kitty, kitty. So? Weren't you with your brothers and sisters? Wait, there's still some milk left. Come on, come. There you go, don't be afraid. Everything's fine. The kitten is purring. Hey, you're a purring machine, aren't you? Yeah, Rroû, that's good. I like that name. Okay, Rroû it is. Hello, Rroû. I'm Clémence. Hi, sweetheart. Isa, that's not what we agreed on. Yes, we did. Like always, you don't listen. What do you mean? We talked about it yesterday, and... Dad, Mom, I have something to ask you. Sweetie, it's not the time. It's never the time with you. We talked about it... No, Rroû! Hey! Clem! Come here. Where did you find it? In the attic. They lost their mother. How do you know? She hasn't been back for several days. But why do you say "they"? There were several of them. Lucille took the others. No, no need to soften up your dad either, I see you. I named it Rroû. Really? Is it a male? Maybe it's a female. Hop, hop, hop! So... I see, I see, I see... I see nothing. It's a girl, miss. If it's a girl, it's even worse. She'll have kittens everywhere, so no. What if I clean up? You won't help? Don't you want to help me? If she wants a cat... Thank you, Fred, for your unwavering support. But of course. How to train A kitten? So... "Kittens tend to test. Like children." "Everything in their sight is a subject of curiosity." "And thus, mischief." Well, the first rule to follow is not to sleep on my bed. Okay? Hmm. I'll take that as a yes. "Suddenly, the unicorn impaled the evil garden gnome." "But he wasn't alone. Behind him," "an army of gnomes under the witch's command, riding dinosaurs." "She alone had the power to annihilate all..." "the unicorns." "And with them," "all the dreams of children." I saw you. Come on, it's okay, you can come. "Fortunately, the rockstar gnome," the one you threw in the trash, "rode his motorcycle to save all the unicorns." The end. Goodnight, Rroû. Ah! Hi there. Rroû! Did we get any mail yesterday? What? I don't know. Rroû! No! What? The door! Rroû! No, Rroû! No! Clem? Are you ready? Hi, there. Come on. Come on, Clem. Hop, hop, hop! Come here. Come here, my beauty. Today, you stay at home. Not like yesterday. Come on, that's it. There you go, stay here. That's good. You don't move. You don't move. Hop, hop, hop! We're staying home today. Right? That's good. Have a good day. ♪ -She's coming. Are you ready, Clem? Okay. Clem, time to take action. It's working! She's eating the kibble. ♪ -She's too clever. ♪ -Well, I wouldn't call that intelligence. The floor is creaking. Don't worry. You're going to like La Charmeraie. It's going to be a long ride. I can't stand this cat anymore. Can you lower your voice? I can't stand it either. There you go. I would've vomited in her place. Yes, Dad. I'll clean it up. Second round. Go on, open the windows, please. Rroû, we've arrived. It's okay. Wake up. It's okay, we've arrived. Well... Why aren't you waking up? Rroû? She's not waking up. Really? No, Rroû! No, no... Come back! Rroû! She got you good. I take back what I said. I kinda like her. Come back, you don't know it here. Just leave her for 5 minutes, she'll come back. Come on, Clem. Come on, you have to unpack your things. Rroû... Well, are you coming, Rroû? Rroû? Rroû? It's going to get dark soon. You won't see anything anymore. Rroû, come back, please. Oh, darn. The witch's dog. Oh, darn, the witch. Subtle. She's grown up since then, hasn't she? What? Have you lost your tongue? You can't even say hello to the neighbor? Hello, Mrs. Neighbor. No. Not Mrs. Madeleine. And Rambo? No hello for him either? Does he have bad breath? It's true that you smell a bit like the bottle, my friend. You know what? Don't tell him to his face that he has bad breath. Because that... is a weapon of mass destruction. Rambo. Rambo. The movie. You've never seen it? It's true that you're too young. Can I go because... Because what? Huh? Is that what you're looking for? Rroû! Hey, hey, hey. She's not an object. Mister Lion King, you're not so tough now. His name is Rroû. Rroû? He doesn't look old, your Rroû. It's a female. Do you hear that, Rambo? And this? What's this? A pair of castanets? Who told you it's a female? It's Dad. If it's Dad, it must be true. Tell him to get rid of the bell. It will get caught everywhere in the trees with that. But she could get lost. He won't get lost, he's a cat. If he leaves, he'll establish a new territory somewhere else. He'll never be lost, your Rroû. What an idea to name a cat like that! Especially a female. It's like calling you Ramboette. She laughs. His name is Rroû. -"His name is Rroû." She imitates him. She's stubborn, the kid. Honestly? What are you doing here? I said: the bell, we remove it. If you lock him in here for 24 hours, he'll sniff around, establish his territory, get used to it, and he'll always come back. Like chickens. It doesn't work with guys. So, have you made any more trophies? It's not a trophy. Art isn't a competition. And how come... you came so early like this? We... We just wanted to enjoy the house. Before... Before what? I'll tell you later. Rambo, I'm going to wage war on you like you've never seen. Fred imitates Rambo. It wasn't my war, you called me. You guys are really obsessed with that. Come on, Rroû. Oh, Clem. We're just joking. Oh, look. How can she live in there? I'm scared. But then, Dad says that... we're afraid of things we've never seen. Because we don't know them. Since that day, I call her the witch. Why? Because she talks to her dog. Huh? On the other hand... I talk to you too. I talk to you too, don't I? Her parents argue. Why do people always say Later, when you're grown up Me, who grows up every day I'm here, and yet I'm waiting for the day to dawn To make the dream come true Today and now To no longer be a child We're not going to spend ages on this, it's just a cat flap. You're not as focused anymore. Let me explain one last time. Step one, you walk. Step two, you push the cat flap. Step three, you go out. It's easy, right? I need to come up with something else. I have an idea. Don't move. It's not complicated. Come on, let's try it. She calls him. Come on, let's try. Come on, this time, it's the one. One, two, three! Rroû, can you hear me? Animal sounds The lynx growls. Rroû, no! Don't do that. No! No. No. No. You're not coming home anymore. Rroû! No! No! Stop! No! Get out! All of you, you bunch of savages. Rroû? No, Rroû. Rroû, it's okay. It'll be okay. Come on. "The punk witch ordered her dinosaur" "to breathe fire on the unicorn village." "Fortunately for them, the non-grudging dwarfs," I would even say not at all grudging. Nevertheless, they impale them, the dwarfs. "they managed to save the unicorn village." "But..." You hear? They're not arguing tonight. -It won't change much for you. You'll stay in the same school. And then... it happens. When a mom and dad no longer love each other. But it's not your fault, sweetie. You're amazing. And the love we have for you, it will always remain, I promise you. Mom is right. We'll always be here for you. And we love you. Very much. I don't understand. We had a great vacation at La Charmeraie. We had a lot of fun. I know, sweetie. I know. About La Charmeraie, you know, my dear... it's easier to sell it. And where will I sleep? You'll still have your room here. I visited an apartment not far from here. And there will also be a room there. But I don't care. I don't care! But I don't care! Do you have to go? Yes. Really, really? Really, really. Come here. I'm proud of you, my dear. You know? I don't want to grow up... She cries. If it hurts like this. Come on... Everything will be fine. Yes. Rroû, I don't want to play. Come on, it's okay, come. Choose your weapons. Which one do you choose? Okay. Let's continue. Yes, of course. We have an appointment to sign the papers. And... When do they want to move in? Alright. We'll do our best, then. Thank you. Goodbye. That was the agency. La Charmeraie is sold. We need to empty the house. Are you sad? I knew it. Is he sad too, you think? Very. Right, Rroû? Can we take him to say goodbye to the house? -It was a nightmare last time. It's not a good idea for him. Really not. Please. Rroû! Clem? Look, it's really soft. Clem, get the cat food and I'll try to coax him. Ooh ooh! Stop playing cowboys and Indians. Go get the cat food. Rroû? Mom. What's wrong? Clem, it's not the time to play. What? Ah, yeah. Couldn't you have told me you were here earlier? We can go now. I can't let you go out. It was nice that you were here. As neighbors, we should help each other. And a good meal like this, right? So? Of course. It was so good. I see you. Don't try to take advantage while Rambo can't move! Here. Take that. The new owners, they're not English, are they? No, don't worry. They're buying up everything here. Soon, we'll be driving on the left. At the same time, the left, that's a good direction. I like that. No politics tonight. Everything is political. Everything is political, Rambo. It is. I suspect he's leaning right. Why are you staying alone in the forest? I'm not alone, I have Rambo. Living here, it's not... Well, it's... What is it? It's not easy. It's not easy to live in the countryside. In the city, is it easy? In the city, you can die with your mouth open. No one will come to pick you up. While here, there are neighbors. You don't starve, there are gardens. Here, you're not a number. And you're not a shadow either. Hm hm. Hey, you've got your kibble. Well, I'm going to go. Well... thanks for everything. You take her with you. You be careful, I care about her, after all. I don't know where I'm going to put all this in Paris. I'm going, Rambo wants to go. I have a feeling that I'm going to miss you, Parisian ladies. We'll see. Well, goodbye. Maybe see you soon, Madeleine. Rroû! Rroû, where are you? Rroû, where are you? Sorry, but we have to go. We've been calling him for an hour. No, we have to find him. We've already looked everywhere. If he's in the forest, it's impossible to find him. But we can. I'll let Madeleine know. If she sees him, she'll take care of him. Phone I want to find him now. Get in the car. Yes. Hello? Yes. Sorry, but it's not possible, we've already discussed this. I told you I wasn't available this weekend. Rroû? Rroû, where are you? Rroû? Is that you? Where's your mom? Stay there, don't come any closer. Do you see what you made me do? Are you proud of yourself? Clémence! Clémence! Are you okay? What happened? Madeleine saved my life. Thank you, Madeleine. Thank you? Thank her. She's just a child. I was looking for Rroû. I know, sweetheart. I know. It will be okay, it will be okay. I'm sorry. Madeleine, if you find him, can you call us? To lock him up again? I need to take care of her now. Sorry, Madeleine. I want to find Rroû. Animal cry I sense it. He's all alone in the forest. ♪ -You're not to blame, Clem. It was his choice. You know, my dear, a cat grows up quickly. Right? Now, he's almost an adult. And it's his decision. But I don't have the right to choose too? ♪ -And what do you want? I want you two to get back together. I love you, Dad. Kisses. ♪ -I love you too. Good night. What's this mess? What are you waiting for? Eat him, that chicken-eater! Rroû? No, no, no, come here. No, don't run away. Rroû! I'm warning you, it's... He's not the same cat anymore. Did you try to catch him? ♪ -Of course I tried. There's no way, he's turned wild. Madeleine, it's her cat. ♪ -You don't understand. He's not the little kitten anymore that used to give kisses. He's not even a domesticated animal anymore. ♪ You have to let him go. You understand? Okay, I won't say anything. What do you mean, I won't say anything? ♪ -You don't get it. Um... That was my job, sweetie. Someone who misbehaves and... You have to tell him. Otherwise, he can't know. You have to tell him the truth. And even to children, you have to tell them the truth. I don't know if you're already up there. But in any case, I hope you're enjoying yourself. Dad told me that you're already an adult now. Actually, I don't know if I want to grow up as fast as you... After all. I miss you. I'm not afraid of the dark anymore. Goodnight, Rroû. Look at this. None of them are reading the sign. However, it's clearly marked "No dumping allowed." It disgusts me. Hurry up. We're not having a picnic here. What? You're annoying. What did you see? Saint Rita summoning food for the dogs? No? What? Rroû? He's not dead. Hm. I disagree. There's no point in informing them. And I said we couldn't catch him. What? Do you want the girl to endure a 5-hour drive? All of that just to see her cat dying. Yes, he's going to die. The vet said so. He won't make it, so... Go ahead, I'm listening. Finish your thought. Make your argument. Yeah, I get it: "But if he's going to die," "Why did Madeleine rescue him?" You're annoying me with your questions. "And why are you doing this? "And why aren't you doing that?" You're not my dad. "And why don't you do that?" You're not my father. It'd be the last thing needed. You could answer me when I'm talking to you. Dishonest. What? You can see there's nobody here. It's pointless to change the subject when you're not interested in the topics. Let's go home. Are you coming? What's wrong? What did you see? No... Did you warn them? You're heavy. Hi. Mom told me that you saw her. Is it true? No. He's in the cabin. It's pointless. Plus, I'm warning you... That's clever. Bravo. What's the point of that? Did you go to the vet? Do you think I put the drip in? Of course, the vet came. And then? What did she say? You don't want to know that. He doesn't need a vet. It's deeper than that. Can we take him to Paris? Are you crazy? Have you seen how he's messed up? First, we need to see if he'll survive and if he wants to survive. He'll survive. We need to talk, you and I. I'll show you something. See, your buddy here, he's a warrior. Got it? He's tough, okay. But here... He's gone to the absolute edge, to his limits. You get what I mean? We'll heal him. Maybe we'll heal him. But maybe not. So, you see this? It's for Rambo. Just in case he needs to go peacefully. You want to kill him? No, I don't want to kill him. I don't want him to suffer, that's all. It's normal. So, in three days, in three days, if he's still like this, there's no point in continuing, because it's torture. It's nothing else. Do you want him to suffer? No. Do you love him? Yes or no? Yes. So, I'm staying. Is it going to be okay? Did you leave me a choice? It'll change you, you'll have company. That's right, company... The company of animals that die, I handle, I'm used to it. The company of girls who cry, it's not my thing. It's nobody's thing, anyway. Well, um... Come on, it's time. Are you hungry? Yes. Me too. It's mealtime. Let's go. Mmm. Smells good. Try this. What is it? You'll see. A surprise. I don't eat meat. You don't eat meat? Since when? Is this new? Just came up? Did something special happen to you? No? Taste it. It's the only thing to eat. It's this or nothing. Here! So? What do you think? Hm hm. Hm hm? A bit tough. Really? What is it? Guess. Don't vomit on my logs. Are you okay? Here. Wipe yourself. Put this on; you'll get cold. Are you okay? You don't look like it. You're really crazy. Am I crazy? Do you hear what she's saying? I'm the crazy one. What happened to the little ones? The little ones are in rehabilitation now. Two of them are at the École Nationale d'Administration (ENA). One of them has entered medical school. The third one is still figuring it out, the little piglet. Seriously? I don't know. You ask me that, I don't know. Okay, they were tough and well-fed. Are they fine? They were big. They have a chance to make it. You see, it's the law of nature. Alright... Shall we go to bed? There are some yogurts left if you want. Come on, let's go. Do you eat yogurts? Listen... Nobody's perfect, but I make them myself. Exactly. What do you mean, "exactly"? I don't feel like tasting it. "I don't feel like tasting it." She's blowing. Not bad, your giraffe. It's not a giraffe. Why don't you like children? Why should I like them? Who said we're obligated to like them? Humans are humans. Humans are mean. I prefer animals. Why don't you like me? Did I say I don't like you? You're paranoid. I don't like it when people bother me, that's all. Look. Hop. Huh? No. The other one! Ma'am! It's beautiful. Did you make it? Do you find it beautiful? Yeah. It's not me who made it. Ah. The one behind, that's me. Ah. Do you recognize it? Yes. That's beautiful too. This one, it's beautiful. This one is ugly. This, it's... It's one side... While this one, it's a side... It's better. We can try with this. It might not be bad. Yeah. Here. You see, the thing that sticks out? Right here? Here. Rroû! Everything will be fine. You'll make it. It's going to be okay. I'm here. They're naughty. What do you think? I don't want him to leave. Maybe it's up to him to decide whether he wants to leave or not. But he won't survive on his own. He's a city cat. You said it yourself. It doesn't mean he won't survive alone. Is that what you want?
