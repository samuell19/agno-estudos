[TIRES SCREECHING] This is the beach. [YAWNS] Morning. -Mrs. Ferris. -Ferris, monsieur? Margo Ferris, yes. I'll check, monsieur. MadameFerris checked out over a month ago, monsieur. Month ago? Yes, monsieur. She moved out unexpectedly and left no forwarding address. I see. Just moved out. -Have you got a room? -A bungalow is vacant, monsieur. It's a little more expensive... Ina. And more comfortable. Please show this gentleman to number 10. -How long will you be here? -Till tomorrow. -Work here for long? -Just a year. Did you know the young American lady who used to live in this bungalow? Yes, she was very kind. Uh, did she say where she was going? Margo! Like our museum? Sure. If you happen to like Gauguin. Did you know that in all Tahiti, there isn't one authentic Gauguin. All reproductions. Seems fair. Everything in Tahiti is phony. I don't understand why people come here. You will. What don't you understand about Tahiti? Just Tahiti. Explain why someone who came here on vacation wouldn't go back home? -Like Gauguin. -[CHUCKLES] It's easy to explain. We decided we like living here. [CHUCKLING] Bravo! But what exactly was your reason? -I like the Tahitians. -Oh, yes? You mean there wasn't anybody you liked at home? What's the enchantment of these islands? Don't expect to find the answer to Tahiti in a museum. Get to know the Tahitians. Maybe I'll just do that. [WOMEN GIGGLING] [NATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] And, uh, where did you come from? I live in the bungalow next to yours. I saw you yesterday. -Don't tell me you're a tourist. -No, no. I'm the manager's daughter. Can you dance? Get up, I'll teach you. Some other time. -Are you an American? -Yeah. Do you remember a woman in this bungalow last... [GASPS] The one that left so suddenly for Moorea, that one? That's right. -Where is that? -It's not far. You can see it from here. Many of the tourists go there. It's very pretty. Wouldn't you like to learn how to dance? How do I book passage for Moorea? [PLAYING MUSIC] [NATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING IN DISTANCE] How are you? Fine. And you? Aren't you guarding those phony Gauguins today? Have you taken the advice I gave you yet? -What? -To look for your answer outside the museum. Are you impressed with Polynesia? -Mmm? -About as much as any tourist. You're not a tourist and you don't like Polynesians. You like to know what my intuition tells me. -Sure, tell me. -You'll find her here. No one disappears. She may hide a while but... -Who is she? -A friend. Is that what you tell people? It's not good enough for you, I take it. For the moment, yes. How 'bout a drink? We can watch the finest dance company in Moorea. I can't get very excited about grass skirts and tom toms. It'll be a good three hours until the boat comes. I won't miss it this way. Come on, I have a boat, come back with me. Thanks, I'm fine. I'm perfectly happy to sit and wait right here. [CHUCKLES] I wouldn't want you to have to wait here alone next to a load of bananas. -Thanks for the ride. -Where are you going? The hotel. Is your friend anything like me? Very much. Well, then, let's be friends. I wouldn't be very good company right now. Why don't I judge your company? Look here, maybe I can spare you looking all over these islands. I'm willing to see what my friends can do to help you. How? You're friendly with the natives? [CHUCKLES] I'm friendly with everybody. Come on. Sunset is the best part of the day for swimming. The lagoon's warmer and much nicer. Why do you wear those stupid Tahitian rags? Part of the enchantment? Well, somehow it gives me a feeling of freedom in the water. And I like that feeling. -Then why not just swim in the nude? -[CHUCKLES] Good question. I don't know. What now? I like a little privacy when I'm making love. You're pretty sure that I want to make love to you. All the men I know enjoy it. Better open the curtains and watch the sunset. It's the only pleasure you'll get tonight. [CHUCKLES] The only one? And besides, I don't think I'm dark enough to meet your standards. You're wrong. The climate can be very surprising. You people are very quick to tan. All right, I'll wait a bit. You might feel like it when you're relaxed. Unfortunately, it takes two to make love. And you're already in love, aren't you? -With your wife. -What wife? Nobody'd be as anxious as you are just to look for an old friend. I'll catch her. What else are you going to do, assuming you do happen to catch her? Find out if this is what she really wants. If it is, I'll let her go. [CHUCKLES] How middle class you are. Perhaps something's happened to your wife, rather than what you think. Why don't you just check with the police in Papeete? [CHUCKLING] There's no reason to involve the police. She hasn't been hurt. I don't know. -Read it. -No, you keep it. I'd rather not know too much. There isn't going to be any bloodshed, if that's what you think. I just want to talk, that's all. And I want an explanation pure and simple. Explanation to what? Your wife just became fiu. Fiu? It's a useful word in Tahitian. Fiumeans plenty. She's had enough of you. When a Tahitian says fiu it means that she's just not interested any longer. If you're going to try to stop her, you'll be wasting your time. Margo is not a Tahitian. A few more weeks and she could be. What name did you say? You want me to find out where she... Margo. -Just find out if she's... -[SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] I was right. Nothing escapes from Wei. She's a Chinese friend of mine who runs a bar behind the pier. Well, does she supply Tahitians? It took me only once to find out that men are no different. Just ask your wife. Your Chinese friend know Margo? You might find her at Joel's tomorrow. He's going to be rehearsing his dancers. It isn't for tourists, but your wife might show up. What for? To see her lover, what else? And he's very brown. -Maybe you'd better explain! -Why were you hoping he'd be a white man? Does it matter what color her lover is? You're lying. Am I? Go ahead, I want you to hit me actually. [CHUCKLING] You better find her and take her back home, otherwise your children will have very dark skin. -[SLAPS] You lying whore! I ought to kill you! -[CHUCKLING] You don't want to kill anyone. You're ready to make love now. You're excited enough. [CHUCKLES] -Let me turn around. -No, stay. You're perverted. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How are you? -Oh, fine, thank you, Joel. Hold it! [GRUNTS] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Let's sit down. Well, what's the matter? Why do you want to find Margo? To beat her again? I won't anymore, I love her too much for that. Listen, you would be paid for your information. I really shouldn't say. Really, I can't say. I just want to talk to her. Please, where can I find her? With Manni. Manni is her tane. Meaning? It means that he's her lover on Bora-Bora. -Oh, how do I get to this Bora-Bora? -WOMAN: By boat. I'll tell you something else, if you buy me a pair of gold sandals. I'll buy you as many pairs as you like. You'll find her at the pier this afternoon. ROBERT: Margo! -Ticket please. -I'll buy it onboard. What do you want? -I'm going to Bora-Bora. -[BABY CRYING] I want to see what your lover looks like, that all right? -Robert go away. -Why? Because I don't love you. Now, if it'll make you feel any better, then go ahead and hit me, but remember the baby. Will you let me explain? I'm not here to hit you. -Then what do you want? -Nothing. Can I speak to you? Hold the boat I want to speak with my tanebefore... I'm not your tane! You're still married, in case you've forgot. I'm not coming back. All right, then just explain. You'd only call me a whore anyhow. It's the word I believe. -I didn't point it. -Please, Robert, come on. You haven't come thousands of miles just to call me names, have you? Whore. Come on, let's sit down. You may not believe it, but I'm not here to soothe my pride, I don't think I am anyhow. I'm here just to see why you've changed, and you have. No, I'm the same woman. -And I'm not what you think. -What I think? You don't care what I think. You'll hop into anyone's bed. Even with a Polynesian. I'm not fighting it. Go on, go on back to him. -That kid belong to you? -Yes. Well, well, if it isn't my Polynesian loving friend. You've got lots of friends, I see. Plenty. I wasn't sure that we'd be able to meet each other this week. Did I forget to tell you, that you were right about her. You were right, about those colored children. -You found your wife then? -At the pier, yeah. But she's back in the island with her taneby now. The part I don't get is that kid she was carrying. Well, I mean, the kid couldn't really be hers, she's been here for only three months. Could it? The reason I ask is 'cause no one's an expert on Polynesians like you are. Hell, the Polynesians aren't that prolific. -Anyway, there's the pill. -Ah, the pill, you're right. [CHUCKLES] I was starting to think that these Tahitians were so powerful that, uh... You know, it, uh, doesn't work. You know, there are women on the island who are willing to console you for the night. I've got one picked out already. The brown one sitting at the bar. She'll be my souvenir of Tahiti. You better be careful, she might decide to give you something else. A souvenir you don't want. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHING] Yeah, it'll be my luck. Deserted and contaminated. I shall be extremely careful. I'll be all right. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] Sorry. I brought your partner back for you. Dance. I thought you like these native dances. Get closer. Break her down. Go on, touch her. Kiss her. [CHUCKLING] She looks about ready. [LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] What are you laughing at? You hypocrite. -What did you say? -Hypocrite. That's what I said. You use these natives like some men use pornography. It's the way you excite yourself. [CHUCKLES] You let a brown get you hot, then you go and get a white man. -Why don't you shut up. -Oh, she's getting nasty. Now what? I suppose you're going to slap me. I might hit you back. In place of going to Bora-Bora and hitting your wife, is that it? Oh, I'll go. I'm going don't worry. Yeah, but not for that, I'm going to take her back. At first I was going to leave her here to rot, because I thought she was like you. Sitting in a bar, it's very easy to be optimistic. But the minute you see your wife's Tahitian lover, you'll change your mind. No, you're wrong. Because I respect Margo for her courage. That's more than you've got. She went out to do what you only think about. Because you wouldn't dirty your pretty hands. She's only been here for three months, she wouldn't have changed. They change, believe me. Faster than a man will. A woman in Tahiti can change overnight as you'll soon learn. Heh, I'll let you know how wrong you are, if I ever see you again. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's Bora-Bora. We'll be landing in a minute. How do I get to the village? PILOT: Well, your best bet is to take the boat to Vaitape. It's the largest island in this group. [MAN PLAYING GUITAR] We'll dock at Vaitape in 15 minutes. You have any idea how large the village is? Oh, it's quite big. It has its own church. -Why are you looking for someone special? -Yes. Know anyone called Manni? Yes, oui.It's a common name. His woman is an American. The only American woman I know around here is named Margo, but she doesn't live on Vaitape. You know where? Oh, she lives on Fatu Hiva. There are two villages on the island, try the one with the football field. You a tourist? No. Is Manni with them? Manni? No, Manni's not here today. Are you here looking for Margo by any chance? Yes, you know her? Everyone knows Margo here on Bora-Bora. Paul, come here a minute. This is Margo's white tane. -I'm her brother. -That right? And where would I find your sister? She in this village? Our village is behind that mountain. We live in Punta Matea. We'll take you there with the pirogue. That's very nice, but I'd rather go alone. -It's a long walk. -And Margo's not back. She went to Tahiti. Manni go with her? No, my brother is still in the village. That's quite a village you have here. Everyone's related to everyone. How did you manage to get here early? You should have listened to me. It's faster in a pirogue. -Are you Manni? -Right. You're early. Margo hasn't returned home. [CHUCKLES] Hasn't returned to this island, you mean? That's right. You said home. You don't mind if I wait? -I'd like to surprise our vahine. -Then wait. Did you come to take her away? -That's right. -Margo has already chosen her life. -Are you sure of that? -Yes. Suppose we talk alone. MANNI: We can talk here. Leave us. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] I saw Margo in Tahiti. Yes, she goes there often, to visit the stores and to dance. And to visit with her friend Joel. And you aren't jealous of Joel? No, because there's no reason to be. You know what she did when I found her in Tahiti? No, but she's free to do as she pleases. Then you won't care that she was with me. [CHUCKLES] It's possible. Oh, she was. We spent the night making love in my hotel. It's possible, only it doesn't mean she's leaving me for you. How do you know? You would have stayed in Tahiti, instead you're here on this island. -Why? -[CHUCKLES] Haven't you heard? Progress has hit these islands. You can save a whole day by plane or take the boat. None of your business. Anyway, what's the hurry? Oh, that's right. I forgot. No reason to rush anymore. Happy and tranquil. That it? Did I get it right? What did you think you'd gain by telling Manni that stupid story? Oh, I don't know. Mostly, I wanted to see his reaction. He said you were free and wasn't jealous or anything. But he did check with you. What do you want, Robert? Nothing. I know you too well. No, you're mistaken. You know, last night in Papeete, I sat in a bar and thought about leaving you here to rot forever. A strange thing happened. I met this woman who I was convinced was made from the same mold as you are. A nympho. When I wrote, I knew what you'd think about me. You were right. Until I saw you at the pier yesterday. But I think a lot differently now. Know why? Because I realized it took guts to leave everything behind. Another one of your tricks? [CHUCKLES] Maybe you're right. You might not believe this, but it would've taken more courage to stay. It's no one's fault. I wanted you to know that I understood. You've made your decision. That's right. I have. Don't try to take me back, Robert. The only reason I'm here is to spend a few days in Bora-Bora. And what's the point of that? Hmm. No point. I'll cause no trouble. Don't worry, I won't get in your way. And besides, it's too late to be jealous. [INDISTINCT TALKING] You, um... You were a dancer once. All of us on the islands know how to dance. ROBERT: Huh, what made you give it up? Oh, I suppose I was tired of it. And then, true they say that all men return to place where they were born. Me, I'll die here as a fisherman. Any money in it? You see I have everything I need. And are you missing anything? No. Margo loves Manni. It's better than a fairytale. The beautiful princess goes to a desert island. Sees the poor but honest fisherman, they fall in love and lived happily ever after. On coconuts and bananas. Let's go, Manni. It's early. Where are you going? To sleep. It's late and I'm tired. And I think you should go to sleep too. You're drunk. I imagine you're taking the noble savage with you to make primitive love. While I'm here, you're not gonna rub my nose in your nauseating affair. Don't hurt him. He's jealous, that's all. Some men are just born fools. Some black and some are white. Go home, Manni. I'll sleep in the guest hut tonight. I'll show you where you will sleep. Margo, you do that. Come on. This one's already taken. So is this. Don't worry about me. I can sleep on the beach. You can use this one. Uh, what about room service? Can I order anything I want? What's the rush? Why don't you come in and keep me company for a while. That's not funny. I want you to leave tomorrow, Robert. [CHUCKLES] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SHUTS] [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] Are you a guest here? Or part of Manni's family? We're cousins, yes, but I don't live here. I'm just visiting. I'm going home tomorrow. So you're just here enjoying a family reunion, is that it? GIRL: I also came to see you. ROBERT: I see. How old are you? GIRL: Fifteen. -ROBERT: Still a virgin? -Yes. Why'd you come then? GIRL: I want you to be my tane. And you don't care if anyone knows or hears this? Your friend might. But that doesn't matter very much around here, does it? You make love anytime you like in Bora-Bora. And with anyone you like. No, no one else. I think they're another one of those Polynesian legends I keep hearing. Oh, you think so. I've seen men go out fishing in weather like this, get caught in sudden squalls outside the reef. No one who's fallen out of their pirogue has ever come back. [CHUCKLES] That would be a great way for a man to dump his old girlfriends. Of course it couldn't happen to you, could it? I'd make sure that I stayed inside the lagoon. But suppose someone threw you in outside the reef. Why don't you have your lunch? Robert, tell me why you came here? But this time the real reason. Come on, you know why I'm here. I want you to see that what you're doing is wrong. No, not for me. I'm not going back with you, Robert. Open your eyes and look around. So far, it's been a big adventure. You don't belong here. You're living with a bunch of savages with cock-eyed moral values. Because they're different that makes it wrong? They're honest unlike some of the people I know. You don't think their values are cock-eyed. You know who I spent the night with? A 15-year-old girl they sent to me to keep me happy. A virgin too, I'm told. Nothing wrong with that? As I recall we were about 14 when we started. Or did you forget? And then, after a year or so of marriage, we were bored with the ways that were normal. What are you saying? That we were perverted? No. But don't you remember getting into bed at nights. How we had to sweat, hours, and only because it no longer seemed very interesting. Hey, I'm not impotent! And I'm not frigid either, but I might just as well have been. And here you're not, is that it? So, that's the reason. All right. Do what you want. Stay here and rot if you want. You think I'm nothing but a whore, Robert. But for the first time in my life, making love is beautiful. The way I've always known it should be. It's funny hearing what sex should be like... You... From you. Yes, from me. Now, go away. Yes, all right, I'll go away. But first I wanna know more about this place, its appeal. Especially to you, all right. Will you explain it to me? Yes, yes. I want you to show it to me, all right? Yes, I'll show you around, but that's all. -Tired? -[CHUCKLING] -MARGO: You're slowing down. -ROBERT: Where are we going? MARGO: Mount Hero, you can see the whole island from there. How'd you get involved with Manni? I don't know. How does anyone get involved? Don't wanna tell me? There isn't anything to tell. We met and liked each other. That's all. You were still married or doesn't that count here? Robert, what's the point to this? -When did you first meet him? -What's the difference? Two or three weeks after I arrived. -Where? -At one of Joel's dance rehearsals. You slapped me there, remember? -Go on. -It's hard to remember. I didn't even notice him right away. Until? Until he started to dance. He picked out a woman, she was a Polynesian. Maybe it's crazy, but all I wanted was to be in her place. Perhaps a man can't understand, but I envied her. I kept hoping Manni would look at me. And finally he did. And then he took me into a hut. Please don't do this, Robert. Please. It won't make any difference in the way I feel. Robert. [PRIEST TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [IN LOW VOICE] Tehina. Hey, Tehina. -Where's Margo? -Wait by the door. [INDISTINCT TALK] I know where Margo is. -Where? Oh. -I'll go with you. -I could find... -I'll show you the way. [STARTS JEEP] TEHINA: Why do you want to see her? ROBERT: To say goodbye. I'm going back to the States tomorrow. TEHINA: I never see Margo at church. ROBERT: Did you expect to? TEHINA: Well, I heard she was Catholic, but every Sunday morning she goes to the beach with Manni. You didn't know that, did you? ROBERT: You can pray anywhere, I suppose. TEHINA: I don't think they go there to pray. ROBERT: I was just kidding. TEHINA: She likes to make love in the open. She told me once that it's better that way. It makes her feel free. ROBERT: Have you ever seen them making love? TEHINA: No. Why should I watch them making love? When I enjoy something I'd rather do it than watch it being done. I know a deserted beach not far from here. Would you like to go there with me? ROBERT: No, I want to see Margo. You know what you're going to see. Why bother? It's funny watching them load the pirogue. You remember, how we'd take the car to shop every Saturday morning. -This is Bora-Bora. -I know. But, uh, don't you miss it sometimes. No. Maybe you're right. It's funny, just last night I was thinking about how easy life is here. Doesn't take much money. A man could come here, retire. I mean, he could build a house right out there. And why should anyone want to do that? Or are you being funny again? No, it's just that I was thinking about getting back to nature. I could live with Tehina. Or I could even live as a hermit, for a while anyway. Go ahead, do what you want. You'll be tired of it soon and you'll go. I'll buy myself a boat and once every week I'll use it to come and visit you. There's no need to visit me. You think I'm a lousy lover. I want a chance to prove I'm not. Of course I don't compare with him. Hey, what do you want for this one? -Come on. -No. [SIGHS] [SPLASHES] Am I wrong, or is that man a waiter? Yes, the hotel. Mingling with lower classes. [CHUCKLES] In Tahiti, we don't believe in class distinction. And anyway, he's a cousin of Malise. Hello, again. For all I know, he's my cousin, too. He could be. He's almost as white as me. You really ought to reconsider, you know. The brown ones aren't too bad. So, you found one? I brought mine here shopping today, just like a regular Saturday at home. Come on, I'll introduce you. And how about the poor wife you were going to rescue? -I gather you gave that up. -Right. No more point to it. You know what they say, don't you? -When in Polynesia... -[SCOFFS] You don't look the type to go native. Well, we'll see. The one wearing the muumuu over there. They're much cleaner in Bora-Bora. Or else, you've become a little dirtier. I've got to get back now, look after my house. I'm having my wife's lover build it for me. ROBERT: How's the house coming? MANNI: I just hired some extra women. Oh, are they the ones in the pirogue? Hi. -[CHUCKLES] -You get here later every morning now. Got no reason to get up early. Besides, I've learned how to relax. You mustn't be too relaxed. You ought to be here to watch them building your house. [CHUCKLES] But Bora has one thing. Manni. You're better than Manni at making decisions. You've managed to solve all the problems, so far. Just build it as though you were going to live in it too. Is that what you're expecting? No. Not really. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] Ha, this has got to be the roof. I hope it doesn't rain too much. I want these torn down. The only house in this island is going to be mine. And that's it. MAN: Poipoi. Hello, Phillip. When's it going to be finished? Not long. A week, a month. What, five months? Look, Manni. I would like to live in this house, -before I get to be an old man. -I know. If you showed more interest, maybe they'd work harder. [LAUGHS ] All right. Which problem shall I tackle today? Well, first, I think that little room on the right ought to be enlarged. What, kitchen? It's big enough. It's big enough for a kitchen. But that room ought to be the bedroom. Is that so? Why? I'll show you, Robert. Where do you set the bed in here? I don't know, ask Tehina. -She'll know about these things. -No, she won't. Well, she's the one who's going to sleep in it. [CALLS] Tehina! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Your bed's going to face north. -So? You once had a fit because I had it set wrong. Oh, I'm not as demanding anymore. Darling, Margo thinks we should change the bedroom. That has to be the bedroom. Because, then each morning I'll awake and face the ocean. MARGO: Tehina, you have to consider the weather. The wind will blow the rain in. It'll come off the roof. No, it doesn't matter as long as I face the ocean. This is women's talk, brother. You two decide, I want everyone to be happy. I wish I could live with both of you. Guess that's impossible, eh, Manni? MARGO: Manni? -Manni, it's getting late, we'd better leave. -ROBERT: Why so soon? You've never tried to cross the coral reefs in the dark or you'd know why. Remember the sharks we talked about? Oh, I'll run you back in the motorboat. No, thanks, we'll go in the pirogue. Besides, it's out of your way. Margo, what's wrong? It's not normal. I don't belong here. No more than you. Does it matter what's normal as long as you're happy? -Happy living with Manni? -Yes. And you? Do you mean with Tehina? I'd prefer living with someone I love. Were you ever in love? I never stopped being in love with you, and you know it. It's getting dark we'd better leave, Robert. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [CHUCKLES] If you get here this late every day, you're never going to finish my house. You especially. Without you here, nothing ever seems to get done. [CHUCKLES] Really? How about her? What's her problem? Tehina, how about it? Why don't you help out? A Vahinecan't work on her own house. It's taboo. Then why come out every day? I'll stay where I want. I like it here. [CHUCKLES] [HAMMERING] I'd like to enlarge this. What? The pilings have already been sunk. -Then pull them out and sink them again. -Start over? You either do it properly in the beginning, or you'll keep doing it till it's right. What's wrong? Where are you going? -Fiu. -MARGO: Let him go. We'll get along. Don't try to stop him, Robert. He's fiu. The men get fiutoo, you mean. I thought women were the only ones. Oh, no. Men, too. Too bad. He was our best carpenter. Listen. Can you take Margo away from here for a while? -Why? -Something's bothering her today. She's upsetting everyone. Pretty. I think you'd better start taking more interest in your house. Next week, Manni and I are leaving for Tuamotu. Why, what for? The men are going to fish for a mother of pearl. For three months. Then why are you? You're fishing for mother of pearl? The men always take their women. Someone has to cook, and sew, and help the men repair the nets. All undertakings which you neither qualify nor want to do. Is that why you've been so nervous? No. You'll probably take it all wrong, but that's not the reason I've been nervous. Go on. It's because I'm not going to be here to finish your house, and it worries me. Is it leaving the house, or me? Let's go back. -Hang this on your wall. It's good luck. -Thanks. Here, let's drink to your trip. I'll drink it later. ROBERT: Here's to your cooking and sewing. MARGO: Aren't you going back to the hotel tonight? ROBERT: We're spending the night here. See you tomorrow. [WATER SPLASHES] [CHUCKLES] There. You see how easy it is to be white. ROBERT: Well, we're making progress, I see. MAN: It will be finished. [HAMMERING] -You're late. -I know. Where's Tehina? Isn't she coming? She'll be here tomorrow. -She slept late again. -It's not funny. That woman's lazy. [CHUCKLES] Robert! I'm tired, let's go. TEHINA: Robert. All right. MARGO: We're having a party in the village tomorrow to celebrate the fishing trip. You'll be there, won't you? ROBERT: Maybe. I don't know. Tehina's been in a strange mood this week. She doesn't even want to leave the hotel. MARGO: How would you like an extra passenger? I need a ride to your island this morning, Robert. ROBERT: I wouldn't want to leave my foreman behind. Isn't Manni coming this morning? The fishing nets need repairing. Oh, yes, that's right. Mother of pearl. May as well go. Aren't you waiting for Tehina? No. She won't be going with us. She's busy with someone. -You mean, she... -She left me. She decided last night. She's going to live with a fellow named Turita. You know how women are like. The fiu,they're for you. I tried to tell her that the island can hold us all, boyfriend included. All live together, you mean? It might work out. Living alone on a stretch of sandy beach gets very depressing. Then why go back? I might as well. It's home. And it's beautiful. The prettiest island in Polynesia. Let it go for once. I could. But... [GRUNTS] It's a habit now. I'm used to going out every morning. You thinking about Tehina? No. If it's over, it's over. I was just thinking... How quickly they become fiu. [SIGHS] You'll find someone. I suppose. I'll be in tomorrow. Maybe I'll even ask you to help me. You know my tastes. Oh, I forgot, you're busy with Manni. You'll be leaving on your fishing trip. When is that? Tomorrow? Too bad. I forgot about that. It's all right. I'll manage. He must be quite a lover. At least, he's made you happy. More than me. [EXHALES] It's getting late. I'd better take you home. Why don't I stay on the island with you, tonight? That's really a home over there. You're the one who built it. How will I ever know if I did a good job for you, unless I spend the night here? Where do we sleep? There's no bed. The Polynesians go out to gather straw. It makes a very soft bed. [RAIN POURING] [WIND HOWLING] MANNI: Margo! Margo. [CHUCKLES] I haven't seen Margo. Didn't she come with you this morning? ROBERT: None of the workmen have shown up either. Maybe that storm held them back. Never mind. I suppose you're right. Might as well explain it to him. I spent the night. MANNI: I know. I couldn't come out for you in the pirogue. -It would have broken in two. -It doesn't matter. Because I wouldn't have gone back with you, Manni. She's come back to me. That's why she spent the night. Is it true? MARGO: It's true. I didn't try to fall back in love. But I think I knew it would happen. Manni, I do love him. I never thought that Robert could prove to me that he could be a lover as well as a husband. But now, I have proof. You're staying with me. MARGO: No. -MANNI: Get into the pirogue. -MARGO: Please, Manni, don't. Robert. You've got to try to explain it. Manni deserves that. Explaining it won't help anything. But it will, Margo. Manni has to understand. Margo, go on. The simplest explanation is fiu. We're fiu. Go away. Just a minute. It's not easy for a man to lose everything. -I know. -What does he want? Manni's very proud. It's not going to be easy back in the village. So, it won't be easy. Why should you care? Because, unless he knows why it's over... He'll try to win you back. What's past is past. It's over and Manni knows it. I knew it too. I still tried and won. I'll explain it. Will that do? You've got to give Manni the same chance you gave me. MARGO: You can't be serious. You want him to make love to me? You're mad, you know that? All right, Manni. I think you understand. I've got to know. So do I. -Go to her, Manni. -Robert, you stand to lose. I know it better than you. Fine. When it's over, one man has to leave. I'll win. No, you won't, Manni. That's why I'm willing to gamble. We'll see. How will you feel if you gamble and lose? All right, come in. See who wins. [INAUDIBLE WHISPER] [STRUGGLES] [GROANS] [GROANS] [MOANS] [GROANS] [ROBERT GROANS] Manni, Manni! You must kill him. I'm yours now. [GROANS IN PAIN] No, don't. He's yours to kill, Margo. [CLATTERS] It was a foolish gamble you took, Robert, but you won. No one won anything. You weren't afraid. I'm glad you weren't. Because, if you had begged... I would have let him kill you. As soon as he touched me, all I could think about was Manni. It didn't matter which of you won or lost. Ten minutes ago, I thought that I could love anyone. Anyone at all, in bed. Still want me back? I do, yes. You might regret this. Maybe I'll change, Robert, but maybe it's too late for me now. I want to be very honest about this. If I find I can't live with myself anymore, then I don't want to live. Take me home. It won't be very easy but let's try. Take the boat around at the dock. [FIRE CRACKLES] [ENGINE STARTS]
