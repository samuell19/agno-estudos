Thank you, operator. Would you keep trying? She should be answering the phone. Yeah, I'll be here, thanks. My dearest Andrea, I write to you in the fear that my life is in danger. While reporting on the recent homeless epidemic, we accidentally uncovered an unholy terror deep beneath the streets of the city. A place where nightmares are born. Reward. Hello. Hello, Robert. We've brought you something. My watch. Andrea. Tell me, what do you see? On the anniversary of a tragedy that, with the passing of time, became a triumphant victory here at the kant institute, I would like to welcome all of you to our annual government-sponsored program for its students. I am professor Damon, Dean of students here at kant. And this being our I choose to set aside the paperwork and do that which I haven't done in a decade, teach. Over the course of the following week, I will be your sole tutor, your only instructor. The majority of our graduates go on to prestigious positions within the federal bureau of investigation as well as the central intelligence agency. I would like each of you to to tell me what you see. Anyone? Joel, Joel Johnson, tell us what you see. Well, I see a lot of televisions. Barbara, tell us your thoughts on the United States and the laws of physics. That's your cue, Princess. Oh, um, politics? I'm a, nevermind. We need some social commentary. Mr. Drake destry. Well, for starters I guess I see a need for answers. Like how do we house these homeless people? Or better yet how do we prevent them from becoming homeless? Concern is only admirable if you're weak. I ask can we amend without revolution? Shelly o'deane, how would you respond? Is god an issue here? If so, is America god's tool or do we create god as a tool for America? Why is it that god and religion always become major issues in these discussions? Because your survival of the fittest ideology does nothing but instill hatred. Our sociologist here is worried about the homeless. I say we tell 'em all to get jobs. It's not that easy. Men like Kennedy and Martin Luther King knew that force solves little. And men like Malcolm X. Knew that force is the answer. Malcolm X. Was misunderstood. Force is a last resort, not an ideology by which to live. We appear to have a difference of opinion. Yeah, one right and one wrong. There is no right and wrong with an opinion. There's only a better or worse philosophy. Hey, I'm right, and that's all I've got to say. And so you are heard, as I hope you all shall be. Leave here tonight. Why don't we take a closer look at the video? This time with an audio accompaniment whereby we can determine the importance of sound in relation to what we're seeing. Concentrate. Please relax and try again. Damn it. - Please relax and try again. - What's the matter, Shelly? Normally this would be a breeze, but... Just try to relax. I think I'm seeing images of the chapel before it was abandoned. I don't know why that should be. Shelly, we can't live in the past. We owe it to those students to move forward. That guy loves me. Joel, what brings you out here? Do I need a reason to see my best friend? Now, Joel, I only seem to be your best friend when you need something. Shelly, that really hurts. I suppose you've heard about that creepy guy hanging out by the abandoned chapel. Yeah, I've seen him. He's not bothering anybody though. Why? Weird things have been happening since he started hanging out at the church. Even professor Damon's acting weirder than normal. Want to hear something really weird? I was trying to concentrate, and I kept seeing images of the campus chapel. Must have been imagining the accident. People say they used experimental drugs on the students to develop their minds back then. I wouldn't doubt it. What didn't they do back in the '60s? Don't worry, I got it. It just slipped. Shelly, would you date me if you were Barb? Joel, there's nothing wrong with you. Now, Barb, well... It's just my legs. I'm still a man though. Most girls would melt over that Joel charisma. Tell you what, I'll put the word out, and soon enough you'll have more girls than you can handle, okay? What was that? Maybe it was professor Damon. I saw him leave. Right. All this talk is making us paranoid. Walk me to the dorms? Shelly, have you seen Tracy? Supposedly she was moving up today with her dad. She should've been here by now. I'm going to look so immature being late for my first day of class. It's all because of you, Harold. I knew I should've had mother take me. Please, Tracy, let's not discuss your mother right now. Why not something pleasant like your leaving for school? Kant institute takes some of the finest students in the entire country. Your mother and I are proud of you, Tracy. You should be, seeing as your only son is selling linoleum waterbeds like you. I was thinking in his best interest when I offered him the job. You never think of anyone but yourself. No, no, that's not true. I thought a lot about your mother and I and divorce. I just hope you're more sensible. J just walking down the Avenue j this early Sunday afternoon isn't that music a little bit loud? J suddenly this girl drove by Tracy, the man at the church said that god follows us everywhere. Is that right? What are you talking? God is right behind us. We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin. A bizarre homicide has claimed the lives of a group of... - Oh my god. Sunday Bible school students. - Stay here. - And their driver, sister Tina Marie Sheldon off 1-96 interstate earlier this morning. The victims from the happy face Bible school were headed eastbound when their bus was hijacked by an unknown assailant. Harold? Their clothesless bodies were found in a nearby ditch, each suffering from multiple stab wounds. Daddy? Tracy, what's wrong? Nothing, just be quiet. Tracy. Is daddy in the back seat? No, just be quiet. We're gonna leave daddy? Hey, who is that? Run, run! Psychology, Drake. Helping screwed up people make it through life. And you, oh, you're a prime candidate for the couch, destry. You and all your save mankind b.S. How the hell did you get accepted into this program? That's what I'd like to know. Please, let's go, Jesse. You're asking for it, Drake. Maybe you wanna quite while you can. It's only a class, Jesse. Just lighten up. Watch your fuckin' mouth, understand? Lighten up or take off. Well, if it isn't miss Frankenstein and Igor. Jesse! Your problems are over here, tough guy. Oh my god. I warned him. He kept goading me. Wait, I'm thinking of something. You wet your pants when you were young, and your mom made you wear a diaper until you were 12. And that's why you hate to wear underwear. I wondered why I never saw underwear in your dresser. Come on, let's get of of here. I said let's go! Well, I hate to leave you both like this, but I'm gonna go hang out in the art gallery. Joel, I'll work on our secret, okay? Wait here. Don't knock it if it works. It'll be okay. Just get it looked at over at the clinic, okay? Okay? Clinic? They don't even have security around here. Careful what you say. My brother's one of those non-existent security guys. Sorry, I just meant... Well, it's so desolate here and, and I think I'll quit while I'm behind. I liked your thoughts on the homeless. I'll always be optimistic about the issue. You'll never hear me say it's a lost cause. Promise? Promise. So do you read minds? Why? Well, if you can, please do me a favor. Sure. Don't read mine right now. It's written all over your face. Why would I have to read your mind? Tis? The library is closed. The janitor went home early. I was going to the art gallery. You know, the one across the hall from the theater. Is there anything wrong, professor? No, no, nothing that can't be amended. Where are you? I want you to leave. I want you to leave now. I wish it was that easy. What do you want? Why are you lying? I have no reason to lie. No fire killed these students. Something did, but no fire. Where did you get access to those files? Your burial ground. It was an accident, the church caught fire. What more do you need to know? Answers. I need to know about this. I don't think you should go down there. Yeah, well it's too late. There's enough of that stuff down there to breed armies of those things. You're a complete fool for coming here, do you realize that? I've lost everything I ever cared about because of that madman. When I linked a series of supposed random murders to the Jones cult, I suddenly lost my job. No one would tell me why. Do you know why? 20 years ago, this place looked like a Nazi prison camp. But it wasn't our fault. The program was young, things went astray. It was time for the super man. We dubbed it project Nietzsche after the philosopher. Back then, a lot of young minds were destroyed by something which, if used properly, could increase mental powers. Your students were Guinea pigs. You've left me no choice in this matter. Professor. Call security, I want this madman out of here now. The professor was just explaining what happened here 20 years ago. Perhaps he'd like... If you so much as breathe a word of this. Breathe it to everyone. Breathe it while you have breath. Shall we take a walk? Why has my research led me to this college? You're making a serious mistake. This is a government project. It's buried what happened here 20 years ago. You pose no problem. If I can find that stuff, so will others. Why don't you stop before you lose more than your family? How did you know I lost my wife, you son of a bitch? You know a lot more about this, don't you? We knew about him, but we couldn't stop him. We couldn't risk the exposure. But we could certainly stop a nosy reporter. Who killed those students? Let him be, Robert. Good lord, professor Jones? Please call me papa. I liked you. I came back for you. I came back to show you that it can be done. Man can be made great. After 20 years, my drug works. It induces genetic changes that I truly find interesting. I use it myself in a somewhat more sedate dosage. I had no choice. They pressured me. You have to understand. You couldn't beat Robert. Prepare your exclusive. I left everything just as you had it. I don't know what to say. Wait, no! Adam? Adam, you here? Shelly. Am I that predictable? Don't you guys pay your electric bill around here? Yeah, the power's down in a few places. We're just checking the main lines by the entrance. Hey, Adam, I think I see the problem. Harvey. Shelly, hang tight and stay off the line. Holy shit, that looks like the janitor's car. Maybe he's just giving 'em a hand. What do you think we should do, man? Adam? Wait here. Harv, I don't like this shit. What the? Do it. Do it now, Bobby. Harv? Holy shit. Did I leave the door open? You did. There goes Barb into the tunnels again. She's such a slut. Shh, she might hear you. Oh, it's beautiful. Great. Oh yeah. Just show me a little more skin. Come on, baby. Great. J show me your pressure just a little more skin babe, come on. J it's a funny pill to take j so deep and wise how's this, Jesse? Beautiful. J no more antidotes great. Come here. J or smoke in your eyes j eat or be eaten j eat or be eaten hey, Jesse, do you really think your producer friends will like my pictures? It's not what you know, it's who you know. Don't you forget it. J you run the race boy j from a world that is gone Jesse, look. The lights just went out in the art gallery. What? That's just that pervert Joel trying to peek in on us. Very funny. Drake, what is it? Something weird is going on around here. The only thing weird around here is you, Drake. Jesse, lay off. I just heard Damon talking with that guy who's been hanging around the chapel. They're talking about students being murdered here. That guy's just some harmless loser starving for attention. Okay, calm down, we'll remedy this quickly. Let's call Shelly's brother at security and ask him if he knows anything about the guy, okay? Where have you been? The phones are down. Try to the front desk phones. If they don't work, we'll take a little walk. Have fun, suckers, I've got a lady waiting. Jesse, look... What are you doing? I've got to go work the front desk. Should I be concerned? I'll walk you down. Bet you Drake's just trying to get even with me. Good, no pigs here. No one home. Yes, be born. The phones work down here? No, and I can't even page security. We're taking a walk over there. Want to join us? This isn't a social excursion. Don't mind him, too much caffeine. What? Just walking Chris down. So tell me this is really a joke, right? We'll let you know if we find them. Joel, this isn't funny. I'm gonna follow 'em. Be good for a laugh. Bitch. Drake's just trying to get even with you. You've already made enough of an ass out of yourself. Come on, a grandma can walk faster than that. Are you tired, Joel? We can stop. Don't stop on my account, guys. What the hell is that? Evil cult. More like let's fool Jesse time. Oh shit, I don't like this at all. Jesse, come on. Wimps. Hey, Harvey, is that you? Hey, Harvey, you in there? If you understood who we've become, you'd understand the need, the utter need, for the reward. Stay away from me. Don't come any closer. Come on. Please, not like this. No, no! Mayday, mayday, can anyone hear me? Damn it, Adam, where are you? What are you gonna do? I can distract him. How? You can't run from them, I can. - But I... - The theater. Meet me in the theater. We gotta make it to the road. Where the hell are you? Paul? Paul? Paul? I don't believe this. What? Those rumors about the drug experiments. It's no rumor, Barb. What are you talking about? Careful, it's some chemical shit. It's corrosive as hell. Who's there? Who's ever there, I'm not in the mood for games. I'm not fuckin' around here. Wait here. Don't go. Don't leave me here by myself. Hey, mister, will you play with me? Holy shit. Come here. Hide, someone's coming. Paul? Oh shit. Hi. Keep away from me, freak. You just missed your leader. He's in the tunnel. I'll tell him you dropped by though. So were you like a real nun? Or is that your evening wear? Jesus. Come here. Come here, you little bitch. Barb! Oh my god! You're not fun. You don't put up a fight. (Paul screaming This shit really works. Hey, help me. J screaming down the mountain j I've the heard people say j ain't got much to feed ya j but tomorrow's gonna pay it's dead. Somebody please. I need help. Is it, is it here? One little, two little, three little Indians. Stop it! Four little, five little, six little Indians. Tiffany. Hello, remember me? I can play now. Papa. Yes, papa. If a god created this world in six days, and I can make hell of it in one night, then god must be dead. Oh, my child, you are madness. True and defiant. Joey, my monkey man. Papa. You are vengeance, determined and timeless. And mother, so benevolent and caring. You have fulfilled your purpose. - Reward. - Tonight. Tonight we celebrate the reward. Leave her, she can't harm us. Joey, go find Bobby razor face. I'll take care of mama. Emergency, please. Operator. Barb? Adam, please. Adam, what's wrong? Please, Adam. Adam, we need you. Adam. Why? Why? It was gagging me, gagging me. I was so hopeless. Shelly, that could be them. J one little, two little, three little Indians j four little, five little, six little Indians j seven little, eight little, nine little Indians j 10 little Indian boys Shelly! Shelly, I'm going to kill you. Shoot it! I can't, it's jammed. It's his miracle drug. It's an acid, but it will eat away at your brain unless it's diluted with your blood first. Jones dilutes it, makes 'em his slaves. I use it straight. Perfect weapon. It's all right now. You go with them, they'll help you. Look after the girl, she needs you. You all need each other. I know you, you're Tracy's sister. Where is she? Them. Who? What happened to Tracy? He came and got her just like him. We've got to move on. We've got to move on. Joel? Joel, are you in here? Why didn't you take my advice and hit the road like I told you? Because I'm not a coward. So you'll die a hero. Someone's up there. Jesus, I coulda killed you. Joel. I saw them kill Jesse. Okay, just calm down, Joel. Have you seen anyone else tonight, anyone? Those things. What do those things want with us? Why is this happening? We're gonna die just like those students did 20 years ago. No, we're not. We need to get help. Drake. What about Drake? I was supposed to meet him in... He ran to save my life. We need to rest. Then maybe we can make it to the road. We need each other. Stay put. What am I supposed to do with this? Stay alive. Behind you! Run! Just enough to make you one of us. Barb, what'd you mean when you said we'll die like those students did years ago? What did you see? I went to meet Paul, and we found this room filled with cages and skeletons. Human skeletons. What were you doing down there with Paul? Joel, this isn't the time. When is it the time? When do you have time for the cripple? Paul is dead. So is Shelly's brother. All you can do is think about yourself. I saw them killed. Look at me. Would you two stop? Can't you see, I just don't want you to... You just what? What do you want from me? Do you want more sympathy, more salve for your wounds? My handicap was born, yours was chosen. Joel, wait. Damn it. I'm a fucking cripple. You can thank your god for that. If I can make them, I can make god. Come to me, Joel. Come to me, and I'll make you whole. I've taken great care and time to perfect my drug. And now I'm giving you first chance. Chance? Drop your crutches and come to me. What do you see, Joel? Come to papa. Come, join me. Together we'll destroy those who mock you, those who you make you feel like a lesser being. Now after 20 years I have a drug that makes ordinary men super men and lesser beings your slaves. That, Joel, makes me god. Damn it, you're in no shape to move. I'm gonna cut through the buildings and try to make it to the highway. You may need this more than I will. You may need this. Joel, are you down there? You're not playing guns with your friends. Well, they always shoot at their worst fears, and they never hit the target. But you're content remaining here, aren't you? Robert is joining us. Will you be the next? I'm so tired. Oh yes, I know. I need someone to be my bride. To breed my race. And you, my dear. You're not the one I want or need. What is it, Barbara? Oh, your worst fear, giving life. Oh, but with pleasure comes pain. Who'll want you now? And all of your old boyfriends are dead. Well, almost. I'll leave you alone with the lesser. No. Shelly. Tell me, what do you see? Shelly. Shelly, it's okay. Thank god you're alive. Drake, I'm going crazy. I thought there was a coffin chasing me. Drake? It's Adam. Shelly, why is he just standing there? Shelly, I'm still alive. Come to me. Adam? Behind you! Drake. It's an illusion, but how? Drake! I killed it. Shelly, I killed it. The drugs. What? These things are controlled by drugs. I don't follow. The drug, it seemed to control the weaker ones. Maybe strong minds, like the leader, control it. And us. Shelly, look, a little girl. Where's Barb? Why did you leave her? Joel, what have they done to you? Barb's in trouble. God, what happened? Drake, she's in shock. It's Joel. What'd they do to him? He was injected. The theater across the hall, take her there. Just what the hell are you going to do? Look, we've been hunted all night. They want blood, I'll let 'em taste their own. Don't leave like this, Drake. Splitting up gets people killed. I'm scared shitless. Please, Drake, please. The boy is in the tunnel. I'll take care of him. You find the reporter. He'll be weak now like you. You're losing strength. You want reward, find him. Barb, where's Barb? Someone's up in the control room. Get back here. Oh my god. No! Tell me, what do you see? I have something for you. Reward Reward. You're gonna pay, you son of a bitch! Doesn't mean we die. Follow me, I know the safest place. But Drake, the little girl, we can't leave without her. Drake, what's wrong with her? Come on, little girl, come with us. Evil. Shelly, we have to hurry. But Drake, Drake. These tunnels run throughout the campus. We can wait the storm out here. The mind is a complex world in itself. Most go through life never fully understanding their own abilities. We live in a control or be controlled world. And the homeless, they are controlled. Control or be controlled, Shelly. That's what it's all about. But Drake, the little girl. I should go back. You can't cover up a past as ugly as this. The homeless were used because there is ho home for them. But Drake. Shelly, it's a trick! Couldn't let Bobby kill you. You're too special. I want you to join my family. Let me show you my art. Shelly, step aside! Drake, run! You'd need a miracle, not me. He can put thoughts in your mind with this drug. Shelly, what do you mean? You use it straight and it kills. He controls it and creates hallucinations. I can control it. I have the power. Now, it's our only hope. I can't. Do it, damn it. It's not working. Stop this madness. Madness has achieved the impossible. I have proven my dream. Now you'll pay the price of being a persecutor just like all the rest. Why should I be persecuted when mankind kills mankind in the name of a god that doesn't exist? How can the government bury me when they gave life to me? How can you judge me when you glamorized me every step of the way? Tell me, what do you see? Stay out. Stay out. I think I'm succeeding. I just need a little bit more time to check the result. Oh no, my genius friend, the government cannot allow this to get out. I've come this far. I'm not going to quit now. It works, it really works. You son of a... No! Bitch. No! Drake! Oldest trick in my book. Could it be possible that god is dead? No, no, god isn't dead. Death is mortal. God is not mortal, evil is. And you, you are evil. Life is immortal. God, god is life. Words. But he's gone. What'd you see? The past finally caught up with him. Is it really you? Is it still written all over my face?
