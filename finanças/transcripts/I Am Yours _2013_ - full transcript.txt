I AM YOURS My name is Mina. I am 27 years old. I'm an actress. I have a son named Felix. Hey! Be careful. Check it out. Looks like you need some more milk, to make them bigger. I like to dance. And... Play guitar. And read. -So, are you sure...? -Definitely. Don't worry about it. -I'll be in touch if you get the part. -Okay. -Great. Thank you. -Thanks a lot. Hello, sweetheart, this is your mother. I miss you so much. Hello, can you hear me? -Can't you come tomorrow? -Felix and I are going swimming. In water? Chlorine just makes his skin dry. Don't be silly. Come around tomorrow. Felix needs to know that his grandmother loves him. Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, and bring some sweets with you. Golab Jamun and Barfi. See you tomorrow. -Why don't you want to go to Grandma's? -Stop nagging! I'm so tired of taking medicines. I don't get any rest anyway. -Her back hurts a lot. -Just her back? Help Grandma. -Let me... -No, it's okay. If only someone would take care of me. No, no. It's so lovely when you give me a massage, sweetheart. You know, young people today... When they grow up... They don't take care of their parents anymore. -I'll go in and see Grandma. -Don't wake Grandma! You'll just upset her. She won't listen. -Tell me, my dear, how are you? -Fine. And you? I hear you're not too well. My back is killing me. Sweetheart, don't go yet! I think naprapathy might help. Forget it. This pain will bother me for the rest of my life. Tell me. This house you designed... How much did you make from the job? Well... I'm doing alright. -Architects are busy these days? -Sure. -We're getting by. Right, Felix? -Sure. It's been nice, but we have to go. Say bye to Mummy. You'll call? I'll give you the number. See you next week. Bye, sweetheart. -Come more often. It makes me happy. -I will. I'll call you tomorrow. -Okay? -Great. -Felix! -Bye. -Bye, Felix. -Love you, sweetie. -Remember to come and see me. -I will. What a fine man. Imagine if he were still a member of the family. That would be wonderful. He would never have left you, Mina, if you hadn't flirted with other men. Don't you agree? -Did you miss me? -Yes, I did. -Sure? -Did you miss me? -That little? -This much! No, it was... That casting session I told you about. -It all went to hell. -Why? They all ask such stupid questions. -They're a different breed. -You've got that right. -Screw them. -Yes. -What's up? -Damn it... Shit, it's my girlfriend. She has phoned so many times. We were supposed to have a Skype meeting. There's a press conference tomorrow. She has to prepare for it. I forgot about it. -I have to go. -Now? You just got here! It was supposed to be now. The two of you are going to Skype right now? -Sorry. -Okay. This is... But I've got to... I have to run, because... Line will go nuts if I don't. -Just go, if it's important. -I'm so sorry. -Would you like the wine? -Yes. -Looking for something in particular? -Some sunglasses, maybe. They're great. You should try them on. Look at those! They're really great. I won't try to sell you anything, convert you, - - or make you my second wife. -You live in Oslo? -No. I'm here with my film. -It opened yesterday at the Festival. -Did it do well? A hit. No. I don't know. -You're a director? -Yes. And a screenwriter. I consider screenwriting the hardest job in film. -I'm an actress. -I knew it. -You knew it? -My first thought: She's an actress! It's true. On stage, in films...? It varies. Right now, I'm making a short film. -What about? -A man who turns into a dog. A man who turns into a dog? That's brilliant. -You play the dog? -No! -You're starring in it. -I know it sounds a little weird, but... -I'll have to see it. -Yes, maybe. -Did you see Pinchcliffe Grand Prix? -Sure. It's a classic. I saw it today at the Cinematheque. I love the message. The whole central intrigue. Gore-Slimey has worked for Reodor in the past. And he's stolen the Supergizmometer. And then... Everything changes, and he becomes World Champion. Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me? You live near here? -Some gum? -Yes, please. -Thanks. -You're welcome. How about a cup of coffee? Or a glass of wine? Tea? Pizza? -I don't eat pizza with strangers. -Stranger? Me? We've known each other for 300 metres. You're right. So, how about that cup of coffee? Or a pizza? Maybe after 500 metres? My mother is still angry that they spent so much money - - kidnapping me to Pakistan when I was 14. But Dad is just pissed off because he missed the pools that week. Because he had to bring me there. That's their way of thinking. -Really? -Yes, but... It was a long time ago. -What happened? -Dad went back home. I lived with these religious relatives I'd never met before. -He went home again? -Yes. But I did all right. Learned the language. The culture. Blended right in, like a chameleon. -For real? -Yes. But it's long ago. -How come you came back here again? -I got bored, so... I made out with a cousin. I don't usually kiss my relatives, but... -You made out with your cousin? -Yes. A real taboo. And...we got caught. And then... Oh God! I'm actually telling you this. So I was forced to go back to Norway with Dad. Now you're looking at me as though I'm mad, and I should have kept quiet. -Did I scare you off now? -No, not at all. -You're not married? -No. Not anymore. -But you have been? -Yes. Okay, but you don't have six kids tucked away somewhere? -One child? -Just one kid who bawls "Mummy." -Is this your son? -Yes. Felix. He's great. Lovely. -You think he looks like me? -What's that? American Football... He does look like you. -You're beautiful. -Thanks. Sexy. -Want me to read to you? -Please do. -Stop it. -I have to hold on to something! -I can't find Ibsen! -Not only Ibsen is buried here. -All the Norwegian Greats are! -Yes, but I want to see Ibsen! -Edvard Munch... -Is Munch here? Where are all the artists? No, stop it! I'll confiscate it. Hi. -Are you tourists? -Well, sort of. -No, stop that. -Look. That's the one. -Is that Ibsen's grave down there? -Yes. Let me see how they turned out. Let's do it on Ibsen's grave. No. They'll throw us out! -Do you have to leave today? -I've got to. You don't really have to, do you? You have to come to Stockholm. Should I? Would you? -If you behave. -Of course. -I always do. -No! You never do. Hi, sweetie! Give me a hug! Oh, I've missed you! Did you have a nice time? Sorry, I was held up. But I've got loads of free time now. He can spend some extra time with me. -Let's just stick to our agreements. -Okay. -See you soon, pal. Enjoy yourselves. -Bye, Felix! -Hungry? Have you had supper? -No. I can make you a hot dog. -You know you can't play with that. -But I love it. I know, but it's just for looking at. Don't touch. Okay? Tell me the story again. Okay. Once upon a time, a long time ago... Mummy was very ill in a hospital in Pakistan. And one fine day, Grandma came to visit me. She gave Mummy this elephant. And just like that, Mummy got well again! That's what happened. I'll make you some food now, okay? I forgot to go shopping. Not again! Here you are. Let's swap. When will you start living like a human being? There's not just you. Your son's future is bound up with your life. Can't you even grasp a simple fact like that? What's missing in this household? Why must you occupy yourself with such disgraceful things? Aziza's son. He's a fine young man. You still have time. Not everything is totally ruined. I can arrange for you to marry him. People will forget everything, and our life will be easier as well. Don't you agree? Try to understand what your mother is telling you. -I don't want to get married. -Listen to her! You never understand anything I tell you. Explain it to her. You only think about yourself. Hi! Most beautiful woman in the world. -Lovely, lovely you. -Can't you come to Sweden? I want to. -It was so great in Oslo. -Yes, it was. This is so frustrating. Please. Come on over here right away. Can't you come here? I want to, but... I'm looking after Felix right now. You've got Felix? That doesn't suit me at all. -Huh? -Just kidding! Just kidding, darling. Bring Felix. It'll be cool to meet Tarzan. Well... Maybe it's a bit too soon. If I can find a babysitter, maybe I can come. Well, okay. But he's also very much welcome. -You know that, right? -Yes. Imagine if the two of you could move in with me. -Maybe. Do you have room for us? -Yes, there's plenty of room here. -Come here and see for yourself. -I'll try. -Think it over. -To Sweden... -Just an idea. -And it's just around the corner. I long for you so much, Come here. Please. I'll try, I promise you. -Okay. Take care. -Bye. Morning, sweetie. Let's get up. Felix. Hey. Hey... We're going on a trip today. You have to get up. Felix, wake up. You're going on a trip with Mummy. -Hey, get up now. -Where are we going? To another country. It'll be fun. We're going to meet a prince. A prince in another country! Now the prince has become Mummy's boyfriend. Isn't that exciting? We're going to Stockholm to visit Mummy's boyfriend. -What's your boyfriend's name? -Jesper. -Does he have a car? -Yes, I think so. -Is he nice? -He's really nice. Really sweet. Just like you. And he lives in a house. A yellow house, with lots of rooms. A playroom for you, and... Want to play helicopters? Careful! Are you having fun, sweetie? -Want to drive on my arm? -Yes. Later. Go to sleep now. -Will he be asleep soon? -Yes. Soon. -Sleep well, Tarzan. -Can you say good night to Jesper? A real bear hug. Go to sleep now. I'll wait for you in bed. You're coming? I'm longing for you. Let's make a deal. If I sing for you... -Will you promise you'll go to sleep? -Yes! Okay, I'll start singing now. Go to sleep, my little man Now the day is done All the mice in all the land are sleeping, one by one Hi. -How wonderful you are. -At last. -I've been longing for you. -I've missed you too. -I've missed you so much. -Have you? -I can't sleep in there. -Felix... -I want to sleep here. -Let's go and lie on the couch. You have to be quiet. -Where are you going? -I have to work on my screenplay. Make yourself at home. Take whatever you want from the fridge. Bye. -Call me. -All right. Here. -What are you doing in Stockholm? -Visiting my boyfriend. -But you're not living here? -Not yet. But I may move here. This is a low budget film, so we can't fly you in. But I'm here so often, it won't be a problem. -You're planning to move here? -Yes. How long have you been with your boyfriend? We've known each other for a long time, but... We've had a proper relationship for a few months. But this character will speak Swedish. Do you know some Swedish? I can give it a shot. -Go ahead. -I speak a bit of Swedish. Happy birthday to you -Are you going to blow out the candles? -Happy birthday, dear Felix Happy birthday to you Are you going to open your present? Find out what you've got! I didn't want to buy something meaningless. -I don't know him that well... -It's fine. I wanted to wait a while. Later on I'll buy him something meaningful. Don't worry about it. It's fine. I will get him a present that is significant. It's fine. He's got plenty of stuff. -Batman! -Look at all these presents! -And there's Batman! -Perfect. -I want to play helicopters. -Yeah! Do it! So you want to play helicopters, eh? -I love you. -What was that? -I love you. -No, you can't say that. -Felix... -I love you! -Listen, Felix... -I love you! Felix, this is important. You can't say that to just anyone. How about some cake? How about a quickie? I don't know. It feels... Sort of scheduled. He's busy, so... -Mummy! -I'll be right there, sweetie! One more minute. -Stupid Mummy. Stupid Jesper! -Stop it. We're just going for a walk. -Isn't walking great? -No, stupid Jesper! -Let's eat something nice soon. - No, I want to go home. -We'll walk a bit first. -No, stupid! Come on, now. Behave. -I thought you were tough, Tarzan. -Stupid. -Tired already? -Stupid! -Hi, Martin. -I've been trying to call you. Fancy a beer tonight? Some wine? No, I'm in Sweden with Felix. I've found myself a boyfriend. You've...got a boyfriend? I'll explain some other time. -Okay, but when are you back? -Listen, I have to go. Bye. He can't just lie there. Are you all right? -Let's go, then. -Yes, back to the apartment. -Are we going home? -It's raining. -I want to go home. -We're going home now. I'm going to check my mail. -Did you write any more scenes? -No. Something to drink, Felix? Want to do some boxing? -Now? -Yes. Sure. I've never done it before. -I'll probably be really clumsy. -I'll teach you. Are you patient? But we'll take Felix along. It'll be fun for him. Yeah. Maybe it's a good idea for him to stay home a bit. He can play Nintendo or something. Have some peace and quiet. Is it all right if Mummy goes out for some boxing with Jesper? You would just be bored. This is important. -I'll enter my number. -Yes. If anything happens and you get scared, you press OK. -Okay. -There, in the middle. -One second. All right? -Yes. Okay. Thanks, sweetie. Talk later. Bye. Left, right, left hook. I'm getting scared! You're good. That's enough. Don't get too good! And a right hook, okay? Once more. Go! Like that. And duck! Have you suddenly become a coach? Hi. -How are you? -I'm good. You? -Mina, from Norway. -Nice to meet you. Some sparring? -We'll continue later. -Keep Felix in mind. -Won't be long. -Okay. Loosen up. Not just single punches. Punch! Keep moving. Circle around him, Johan. Hi! -How are things going? -Fine. -You? -Fine. May I speak to Felix? -He's not here right now. He's at home. -Home? Is he alone? We're just out doing a little boxing. We'll be home in a minute. -Is he home alone? -No! Hello. -He's not home alone, he's with.... -With whom? Actually, some friends of my boyfriend. -They're looking after him. -He's with strangers? -No. Felix knows them really well. -But they don't know him. -I don't like this. -I have to run. I'll call you later. Felix! Felix, I'm coming! Forgive me. Are you all right? Sweetie... You were supposed to call Mummy if something was wrong. -Everything okay? -I have to calm him down. -I'll do some writing. -Listen... -Was it that bad? -I want to go home. Felix. There, now. Daddy called and asked how you were doing. Maybe you could call him tomorrow? Then you can have a chat with him. Felix. Need some help? Felix, eat now, so you grow big and strong. Have some meatballs. Hey you. Try to sleep the whole night through, okay? If a bad man comes... Who should die? Jesper or me? -That will never happen, Felix. -Yes, it will! You don't love me. -Will you sleep the whole night through? -No. -You don't love me. -Yes, I do. You don't love me. Can we talk? Yes, sure. Of course. What is it? I can't deal with this situation. It's like... I feel really bad about this, but... I can't deal with Felix being here. I can't handle it. It's... It's too much. I'm totally starved of adult company. I understand, but what am I supposed to do? I want to be with you. Can't we work this out? We'll go back to Oslo, and you can visit us. Get to know us better, I realize this is all new. -And he can be a bit much. -I can't think clearly. You understand? It's all chaotic. I've got a screenplay to finish. I'm not in balance. I can't think. I need time to myself. Some space. Just a few days, okay? I need a few days to sort things out. Think it through. Get things in order. -I can't be a family father right now. -I understand. -This is not me. -I understand. This is not me. But tomorrow we can have a nice breakfast. You, me, and Felix. Then you may borrow my car. -Would that be okay? -Yes. I think I'll leave now. I think it's best. Now? -Please. -Felix. It's like I throw you out in the middle of the night, with a small child. Please, Mina. I didn't mean things to turn out like this. I understand. This is all wrong. Do you realize how this feels for me? I understand. But I have to leave. I'll call you. Felix. Felix? Felix! Felix, where are you? Answer me! Felix! This isn't funny anymore! Answer me! Felix! -What are you up to?! -Easy! Damn bitch. What the hell are you doing? Why did you run off? Look at me when I'm talking to you! You're not allowed to run off from Mummy! Do you understand what I'm saying? Look at me! You're not allowed to run off from Mummy! Don't you understand? Damn brat! Promise me you won't run off from Mummy. Okay? -Can you say it? -I'm not allowed to run off from Mummy. Hello there, my boy! Come here! How are you doing? -I've missed you! -Can I have a goodbye hug? -Give Mummy a goodbye hug. -Come here. See you next week. I'll call you tomorrow. -Tell me what you've been up to! -We played games... Hi, this is Jesper. I can't come to the phone right now, but leave a message... Hi, this is Jesper. Hi, it's Mina. We've arrived safely. I hope you've had some time and space. Please give me a call when you get this message. Hi, this is Jesper. I've been in Sweden. Visiting my boyfriend. My contacts there asked me if I wanted to audition for a film. -What kind of role? -The lead. And I'm in the last three, so that's exciting. -Do you have an agent there? -Not yet. -I've been in touch with some people. -Exciting. We've got more than enough. Thanks for coming in. -You're sure? -Yes. -Thank you -You're welcome. -Will you open the door? -Mummy? -The door is not opening! -I'll come downstairs and open up. What's happened? Your father has wrecked my life. This is for you. You know... Yesterday I invited Mrs. Chamim and Mrs. Vakaar for supper at our home. I made kofte and kebab. Roti, raita, salad... All with my own hands. But did they touch the food? No. They just complained about you. Mrs. Vakaar has seen you out wearing practically nothing... ...and kissing a stranger. Then your father started yelling at me, as though it was my fault. How can it be my fault? I never told you to run away from home... ...and start doing things that bring shame upon us! Do you know how much he beat me last night? Then he walked out of the house and didn't come home. Tell me, who will listen to my pain? I'm talking to you. Are you listening? I'm listening. It's not my fault. For a long time now I have been punished for something I haven't done. Am I not a human being? My heart longs for peace and affection. What I... What I wanted to say was... Can't you come over and visit us from time to time? Okay. -Hi. -Hi, beautiful. Sorry to wake you, but I'm really desperate. There's a party going on. I wanted to get away from it all. Are you all right? My photographer is so attention seeking. You'd think he was doing it all himself. -But, my love... -He doesn't respect our collaboration! Don't cry. Hey... I told my shrink. I don't know how we can work together. Stand up for yourself. You should be here. Then I could kiss your beautiful hands. Can't you come to Oslo? What do you think? You're so sexy when you're concentrated. You're gorgeous. I've got some more muscle tone. Want to see? -Do you see? -Well done. You're looking good. God, you're sexy. Can't you take off some clothes? -No... -Yes. Please undress. Okay... Oh, you're so sexy. Show me your tits. I want to see both of them. -So this is where you are. -Hi. Say hello to my Indian princess from Norway. I've heard many great things about you. My best friend and director of photography, Simon. Mina... -Isn't she beautiful? -very pretty. Bye, Mina. Talk soon! -Get back to the party. We miss you. -Yes, I'm coming. -Come on, Jeppe! -I'll be right there. Sorry, Mina. I don't think he caught on. I hope not. -Sleep well, darling. -You too. Mina! Felix, Mummy's there. -Mummy is coming. -I don't want to go. Let's just finish the game. -Hi, Mina! -Hi. How are things? -Nice to see you. -Everything all right? -And you've got a dog! -Yeah, a real fatty. -Want to say hello? -I'm a bit scared of dogs. -Do you want a cup of tea? -I just had some coffee. Felix! Want to see what Mummy has bought? Want to see? Come. Give me a hug. It's great to see you. Water... Then a little magic... -I want that one. -That one. Okay. You think you'd like a real tattoo when you grow up? Of a dragon? Okay. Let's see... It's cold! Put your hand on top. Like this. And count to ten. Have you had a good day? My whole body is crying out for you! I'm the only one who can hear it screaming. I'm coming soon. -You're coming here? -Tomorrow. Fantastic! I can show you all of Oslo. We can go to the flicks, drink champagne... Stay in bed all day, if you prefer. -I would die without you. -No. It's true. I'd die without you! Listen. You're fantastic. -You are fantastic! -No, you are fantastic. -You are fantastic. -Bye. We'll go to Daddy in a minute. Then you can be with Daddy for a few days. Is that okay? Felix? Is that okay? Like you spend time with your friends,... ...Mummy needs to spend some time with Jesper, who is my friend. Okay? I'm sure Daddy misses you. Don't look at me like that. I love you. And they've got that cute new dog. You'll all have lots of fun. Let's go! Daddy will be really surprised. Hi. Sorry. We'll have to go back to the original plan. -Let go of me. -No, you have to wait here. I can... I have to deal with something. I'll be back with the drawing shortly. Hello, my boy. Just wait here while I talk Mummy. I'll be back in two seconds. Sit here. Sorry to show up out of the blue. There's a bit of a crisis today. -I can't have him now. I'm at work! -I realize that, but... We must stick to our agreements. -I can't step in... -I don't mean to mess things up. Mummy is ill, and I have to prepare for my part. He's better off with you when I'm this busy. Bad timing. I can't do this. Can't you help me, and have him for a few days? Don't ask me to do this again. Not ever. This is the last time! I promise. From now we stick to our agreements. Don't ask me again! Hi, this is Jesper. -I don't know what to say. -If there's that much stress,... ...I can come to you. It's only an hour on the plane. -I don't know what to say... -Wouldn't it be nice? -Mina, don't push me. -I think it would. -Don't pressure me! -I'm not, Jesper. But that's the way it feels! Inside. My whole life has been ruled by women. Mum, then Frida, and now you. Stop it! I need to be by myself for a while, Mina. We can be friends, right? Best friends. Mina. Okay? -Hey... Can't we be friends? -Jesper... -I don't want to complicate things. -I understand. -I just want to be close to you. -Mina, I don't want to! It's really hard, but... That's just the way it is. That's just the way it is. Do you understand? Hi! -Great view. -Nice to see you again. -You want coffee or tea, or something? -Not really. -Do you have anything stronger? -No. I'm afraid not. Never mind. -You don't want anything? -No. -Did things go well in Stockholm? -Yes, everything's fine. -Well... -Nice of you to come around. Yes. Sorry, I just... It's all right. -Are you okay? -Yes. -And you? -Yes. Fine. How are you, father? I brought some sweets. You like these. And this one. Have you started working as a prostitute? No. It is all very disappointing. Don't you think I know what you were up to in Stockholm? The whole community has shut us out. -But... -Enough, I tell you! In all of our circle of acquaintances... ...you have spread filth and shame over us. Thanks to you, we are outcasts! We no longer want you in our home. From now on, all our ties are severed! Do not come to this house again. Never come back. Gin and lime, and the one behind that white one there. That's it. That one! What are you drinking? Beer. -Are you here by yourself, or what? -Yes. -You're not very talkative. -No, I... I'm a better listener than a talker. Shy? -I'm not. -No... I believe you. Want to dance? -Sorry. I don't dance that well. -What? -I'm not a good dancer. -Of course you are. Come on! You're a whole lot better. I'll just watch. -Food. -Bun. -Grandma. -Cabin. -Ski. -Snow. White. -Clean! -Pine oil soap. Pine oil soap? Summer. Sun. May. -May I sit on the back? -Sure. Just a moment. -Is that okay? -Yes. Stop! I have to get off. -I have to get off. Just stop. -Okay. -Are you going home now? -Yes. I have to get home. But let me have your number. -I can give you a ride home. -That's all right. I just have to go. Let me have your number first. 41... 46... 96 33. -Are you okay? -Yes. -I just have to get home. -I see. Thanks. -Bye. -Okay. Bye. -Sure? -Yes, I'm sure! -Sleep well! -You too. Bye for now, my little boy. Have a nice time with Mummy. I want to show you something. Come here. -What do you have in mind? -Come! My helicopter. -Come! -Go ahead. -Does he go in there? -No. Not in there. He'll sit here. And this one. Look at this helicopter. I'll put the teddy in the bag, too. Hey... Daddy will be here soon. In only 5 minutes or so. He's at work, that's all. And he works a lot, you know. So does Kiran. And Kiran really loves you. I think she's really nice. Do you love her? And you miss Daddy too, don't you? It'll be great to see him. Felix. You know that I love you dearly. You know that? Just sit here. Mummy has to go now. It's important. Hi, it's Mina. Did I wake you? May I come for a visit? Okay, see you soon. It's my grandmother's place. -Would you like a cup of tea? -Yes. Please. -I've only got green tea. -Perfect!
