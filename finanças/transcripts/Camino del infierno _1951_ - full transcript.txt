a.k.a. ROAD TO HELL "Hypocrite... A plain and simple hypocrite... Wicked... You made a fool out of me. With your deadly charms, you poisoned me... And while I knew it hopeless, I still fell for you. ...But know this. Hear and undertand this... I just can't... I just can't live anymore. Like poison ivy, you've seized and ensnared me... And as you don't love me, I'm going to die." For you, I'm capable of anything. Anything? You know what Tony says? That I'm an expensive woman... Costly... If I'm with him, it's 'cause he's rich. He denies me nothing I desire. I can't help it: I love jewels, perfumes, furs! I could give you all that. I earn good money with Tony. I won't settle for leftovers. With me, it's all or nothing! I won't leave all that for your love I've told you before what I want. Now what? Not that, Leticia! Ask what you will, but not betrayal. You know we're friends. You betray him in desiring me. You want to steal his girl. You've poisoned me, Leticia. You're in my blood. I don't know what to do! I do... Tonight, like every other month... he'll have around $300,000 in his office. We do the job, then I'm yours! - Is there any other way? - None! If you want me for yourself and for always, do as I say! If not, take a hike. I'll do what you want, Leticia. But we shouldn't be the ones to do it. Nor any of the guys. Tony is cautious, vindictive.... And if we miss? - That can be fixed. Find someone he doesn't know. I've thought of this.... And I think I know who. - Is he trustworthy? As much as the two of us. C'mon, he's alright! An ex-con who served time for a job he didn't commit. May we know his name? You won't know him. He's kept straight since getting out. He's honest. His name's Pedro Uribe. He's a waiter at a cabaret. Things don't seem to be going well. He's all resolve... Capable of any job you throw his way. "THE DESIRE: A Family Venue" This is our man. - How's things, Pedro? - You're looking at it. Ordering drinks? - Cut the act, mate... We're not here to drink. We're here 'cause we have a job. What kind? Something easy, with good money. But this ain't the place for this. Can't we talk somewhere else? Of course. Wait for the end of my shift. No! This happens now. Because the job happens tonight, dig? Alright. Follow me. Everything's planned out. And as they don't know you, you'll just walk in and take it. You'll earn $5,000. I don't pull jobs like these! You're just afraid, Pedro. Find someone else. I'm not interested. Hold on... We're not finished. - I have nothing left to say. - Perhaps, but we do... You know too much about this job. Whether you want or not, you're part of this. You may sleep easy. Leon, you know I'm on the level. I'd never talk! I bet the owner here doesn't realize that Pedro Uribe.... served time for robbery. - I never stole a thing! Convicted with time served. He'd take it poorly and throw you out. Help us this once... we'll never bother you. Leon's spoken fondly of you. Says you're a brave man. Me, I like friends like that. Don't you want to be friends? If I were to ask you real nicely.... would you say no? "Of that affection... ...between you and I there remains nothing. Those very things... ...which brought us together... ...pulled us apart. One glance and a few words That's how it was born... And that's how it dies. One look and a few words... ...were the spring... ...from which erupted... ...the scalding torrent of our love. One look that told me that you loved me And some words that told you... I love you. And with time... one look, and a few words became the things that destroyed that love. And one look, which told me, 'I no longer love you'... And some words which told you..." Whiskey. "'Neither do I'" Third door on the left. You armed? - No... I don't need trouble. "And with time... One look And a few words became the things... which destroyed that love. One look which told me, 'I no longer love you'... And some words which told you 'Neither do I'" - Who is it? - It's me. Open up. Hey, baby. Leaving so early? - Yes. The last number's over and I'm tired. I have a headache. I'll be later. - The month looks successful. - No complaints. And that's before my cut from El Rana, my biggest contributor. - Congrats. - Careful, You've got a grand stuck to you. Don't be cruel, you have plenty. - You're insatiable! - Be nice, give it to me. Take it from my salary, eh? What a laugh. Salary? I've already paid you three years in advance. It's in the second drawer to the right of the desk. Second drawer, right of the desk. Be quick and get out through the window. Nobody else? Two black! Place your bets. No one else? - How is it? - That lawyer's lost $30,000... Says he can't cash this before the date. I'll cash it, it's certified. Who are you to be here? Who do you work for? Who gave you the key? Speak or I'll plug you! Coward. Pig. Traitor. What happened? The money? No, it all went bust. Imbecile! - You double-crossing... - Let me go! - Shut up and go! - I'm not going anywhere. Shut up or you'll be spitting up teeth. Move it! You'll pay for this. Leon and Tony will see to that. Oh... It won't be easy seeing as they shot each other up. So why didn't you grab the money? I told you I didn't want trouble with any bloodshed. You're a coward. These toys are for men. If you don't want something bad to happen to you... Play straight with me. Right at the corner. Turn off the lights and get moving. - We're going to stay here a while. - I have no reason to stay here... You put me in this mess, now you'll play it through! Move it! - Where are we? - Why should you care? Where we won't be found. You're not leaving! You're a coward, a filthy coward. Now you'll know not to toy with me. You'll pay for this. Inside now! You'll find a candle in that corner. Here. There's a sink. Take that can over there... ..and fill it. I'm thirsty. Move it! It seems you know this place well. I lived here after leaving prison. You should've stayed there for life. You'd poison this water if you could. You look like one of those snakes who wait to hypnotize their victim... then strangle them. That won't happen with me. I can wait. I told you I'd be waiting. I'll kill you like a dog. No one will hear. You yourself said it. No one's here. No one will know. If anyone ever comes... they'll find you food for the rats... Filled with maggots... Food for rats... Food for rats... Food for rats... ."...That ends our musical program for the day. Until tomorrow, we bid you goodbye. This same hour. Next, a short musical break." Do you remember last night? Yes. If you were going to kill me, why didn't you? Because as I was pulling the trigger to fill your head with lead... You lost consciousness. And you wouldn't know what happened. What are you waiting for? Why not do it now? Because I pity you. I wouldn't do the same for you. You may regret it! You're a sentimental fool, like all women. You might be right. I am sentimental. It's happened to me once before. I couldn't kill a dog I found injured in the street. Shut up and leave me be! It's what you deserve. To leave you rotting in some corner. But as I'm sentimental, I'm going to heal you. The first thing to do is clean and dress the wound. For what? It's only a scratch. It'll heal by tomorrow or after. If it gets infected, we'll need a doctor. No one leaves or enters here. Understand! Are you afraid I'll turn you in? My life has taught me to trust no one. You're dumber than I first thought. Last night, I could have done it easily. This is ugly, you can see the bone. Careful! Bear with it, even if it hurts. I'm going to bandage you with a handkerchief. That won't work at all. It's too small. I have some scissors in my bag, okay. "...Like everyday at this hour, we have for you... ...the top stories of the day. Mexico: War between gangsters. Last night, inside the popular nightclub, Tony's... a grisly incident occured... leaving dead: Tony, owner of the club... and Leon, one of his gunmen. Police are investigating the scene. Oaxaca..." - Did you hear the radio? - Yes. This thing, it's ugly. Real ugly for you. For both of us. You planned it all. With me, they can't prove a thing. I was Tony's girlfriend and nothing more. Tony's girlfriend! And Leon? Weren't you lovers? He wanted that, but he didn't have a cent. That's why he cooked up last night's mess. For your pleasure, two men died. I didn't ask them to kill eachother. I simply told Leon what I told all the others: If you want me, you better be a man who takes on the world. Rich, and generous. 'Fools', you'd say! Wasting their money on things that aren't worth a damn. Like you. - Who is it? - It's me, Dr. Fausto. Ah, it's you, Leticia. Come in... come in. I know about Tony. It had to happen one day. - What do you plan to do? - Don't know. I'm here one a different matter. I need your help. Me? help? What is it about? A sick man. Well, a wounded one. Ah, a wounded man, you say. No doubt involved in something ugly. Who is it? Don't concern yourself with that. I just need to know if you're able to help me. - The dough? - I'll pay whatever. - You? -Yes. me! I'm as good for the money as Tony was. I have my savings. Where is he wounded? He took a bullet in his hand. In a hand? He's fallen to pieces. All afternoon he's been feverish and delirious. I was scared. That's why I called on you, it happened so suddenly. Is it serious? Terribly so. What can be done? I operate. What's this mug doing here? Who is he? This is Doctor Fausto, we can trust him. Yes, my friend. With full confidence and discretion. No fail. Get out! Leave me be! As you wish it, my friend. But first you must know, that at any moment... gangrene will set in that hand... And once there, your life ain't worth five cents. If you want to stay alive, we need to operate. You can't leave without saving him. I don't have the necessary instruments. I need to anesthize him, and for that, I'll need to move him from here. Operate if you want, but I won't leave. And woe to however tries to move me. You will suffer greatly. What matters is that he lives. That I cannot promise. There's great risk in removing a hand without adequate tools. He could bleed out... Then that's how I'll die. Operate already! Very well. The customer's always right. I don't know how... But I'll operate. He could have been spared the pain. What did he do to shut himself up in this rathole? I already told you: ask nothing because there's nothing to know. That's between you two. He'll be asleep for hours. When he wakes, give him one of those pills... to calm him and bring down his fever. Come see him every night... Because for several days, he won't be able to stand up. If you need anything, come look for me. Thank you. We had to. You would have died of gangrene. Why would I want to live like this? To be pitied? To wander the streets begging for alms? I'd rather be dead! - No! - Why do you care? You're a coward. You're afraid of life... You'd rather kill yourself than face it. I should kill you! Then kill me, but you won't shut me up. Don't say you're worthless. It's not true, for you've already faced worse things than losing a hand. Shut up and leave! You don't have the courage to confront your fate. It'd been better if I'd left you here to die alone. Pedro. Pedro! - What do you want? Listen to what the paper says. "The mystery surrounding the attack at Tony's was cleared up this afternoon... when Captain Albornoz, of the Secret Service, told newspapers... that both Tony, owner of the nightclub, and his gunman Leon... quarrelled, killing one another. The initial theory of robbery was dismissed, as officers found... among the scene nearly $300,000 in banknotes." - We're saved. - So what? Things will be different now. You have a fever. I'll get your pills. I already told you I don't want your pity. Understand! I don't pity you. I just want you to get better. For your own sake. For my sake! After all you've done to me. Curse the day I met you. You're just anxious. Here... This'll calm you. Are you cold? Yes. It will pass. Not with such a small coat. My body will warm you. Go to sleep. You'll see. When you wake up, you'll feel better. Next you'll be telling me you have a heart. Sure, I have one. You don't believe it, but you don't know me. I'm a good person. Everything I've done has been out of fear. Fear? You? Of what? Misery, hunger. Better that than luxury trash. When you come from a miserable neighborhood... From dirt... The only thing you dream of are the good things. I watched my mother die of tuberculosis. My brothers from hunger. As a child, I begged. That's why, when I found the chance... I clung to it, thinking it'd save me. If I'm trash, it's only because I'm afraid of returning to that. When you chose me for the job... you didn't seem to be thinking of your mother or brothers. I think of them always. Of their faces, dead. Of their mouths, begging for bread. And all of it, because of my father. A miserable drunk who made us suffer terribly... only to abandon us in the end. That's why I've hated men so much. Thinking of nothing else but how to give them all the trouble I could... to avenge my mother. Then why worry yourself with me? Because I feel you're not like other men. That you've suffered, and still suffer, like me. - What do want? Leave it. - I just want to help. I don't need your help. You still think I'm doing it out of pity. I don't know why you do it, it doesn't concern me. You know, you've very handsome. After all these days with a beard, I've forgotten how you look. Like a different man. - Oh, really? A different man? Then take a good look, because it's the last time we'll meet. Why say that? Because I'm leaving today. Now I'm strong enough to leave this crypt. - Pedro, I... - You can do what you want. It's not that. Pedro, I need you to know, more than anything, that I... That I love you. You? Love me? A cripple, poorer than a dog. There's no need to laugh. If I love you, it's for who you are, not what you have. And I should believe that? Let me spend some time with you and I'll show you. You're still weak, you need someone to help you. I'll be your nurse, your maid. - You? You didn't use to feel that way. You were queen of the world. But I didn't know how wrong I was. That life, alongside a man you love, could mean something else. In all these days I've spent with you, I've discovered... The whole world isn't rotten. Now look, Leticia. I've had too much experience for you to believe that I'll fall for such a line. When one has lived in vice, like you have... you don't change so quickly. You have far too much venom in your blood, and hate in your heart. There's only one step from hate to love... and I've already taken it. That can't be, Leticia. Goodbye. At least let me accompany you home. You're still weak. Alright, but then you leave. It's better this way. I'm bad luck and nothing else, sometime without even enough to eat. I could never give you money, dresses, perfumes. - I'm not asking for anything. - Leticia, I'm telling you no. To join my life with that of a woman, I'd have to love her greatly. As for you... well... I don't love you. It doesn't matter, I want to. You're kind and I know you'll grow to love me. I can feel it deep down. We women are never wrong. You're wrong now. This is the first time I've been honest with a man. Believe me. But now I see it's all been for nothing. If, later, you ever need me don't hesitate to call. I... I'll always love you! Pedro. I've done it all to keep you away. With me, you'll have only poverty. It doesn't matter if I have, if I love more than anything. Are you sure it'll always be that way? That you'll share my life, through richer or poorer... Come what will, you'll be always at my side? Always! We'll be together until death do us part. Starting now, we begin life anew. We'll forget the past, I'll go back to work. And I'll sing and dance again. I'll earn lots of money so we'll never lack. You'll never lack a thing. I said we're starting a new life... Especially you. In my home, I do the working. The woman who shares my life... should only think on the home. I don't want you to embarrass our children some day. Our children? Yes. Why shouldn't we have them? Most married couples do. Pedro, then you think that... We should get married? Of course! You should do things right or not at all. We'll do it at once. - Thank you, Pedro! I'm the happiest woman. People, people! A moment of silence, please. As godfather, I'd like to be the first to serve a toast to the newlyweds. And to announce, as a wedding gift... that I am offering Pedro a promotion to manager. Do you accept? - Thank you, Don Fermin. I do, and I hope to prove worthy of it. I know it, Pedro, I know. And once again, I hope you all the happiness in the world. May you always count me as a true friend. And... uh... Long live the newlyweds! - Are you happy? - So much I'm afraid. I'm not used to happiness. There's no amount that could buy this. Maybe one day I can repay you. You don't have to do a thing but love me. The way I love you. The way I will always. At last, God will show mercy on us and allow us to enjoy life. - ...And children. - Many children Do you want them? - With all my heart. Here are the keys, Don Fermin. I'd like to ask a favor. - Yes. Give me tomorrow off. - Your saint's day? - No. It's our one year anniversary. - Forgotten already? - That's right... How time flies. Are you having a party? Not exactly. Just me and her... I understand. Why don't you join us? You're like family. Oh no. These things are better done alone. I'll give you the day... and here. Something special from the godfather. - Thank you, Don Fermin. Until after tomorrow. - Very well. - One last thing. - Yes? I want to have a word with you about the business. "Without knowing you existed, I desired you. Before I knew you, I divined you. You arrived the very moment in which I awaited you. There was no suprise once I saw you. That day when you crossed my way... I had the foreboding of something fatal. 'Those eyes', I told myself, 'are my destiny.'" - Have you gone crazy or what? - This is the surprise I promised. What day is it? - I don't know. I think it's the 5th... no, the 6th. That's it, the 6th. One year since we married. - That's right! I forgot. Forgive me. Don't worry, that's why I'm here. To remind you of all you've forgotten. You're so good! That's why I love you so. Everything I do is simply to see you happy. Look. From Don Ferm?n, to buy a gift. And he proposed something which I have to tell you. But now, come and let the guys see you. "Those eyes... are my destiny. And those dark arms... are my sorrow." I feel a little unwell. I'll wait inside. What is it? What's wrong? It's nothing. You've gone pale. I felt light in the head, but I'm fine now. You work too much. Go lay down. I'll send the guys away. Can't you sleep? No. I was thinking on Don Ferm?n's proposal. What do you think? It seems like a lie. Never could I imagine that through honest work alone... a person could become rich. Because now we will be, right? - Certainly. Can you imagine? Owners of a cabaret like Desire. You'll never tire yourself again working. Nor will you spend your nights sewing my shirts and socks. We'll take on a servant. We'll move to a better home. No, Pedro. I don't want to change. This house is good luck. This is where we began our life. And it's turned out great, no? It's not the house that brought us luck, Leticia... It was turning a new leaf. It was being good. It has its advantages. And despite what many think, it's a great deal. Have you every felt more happy and more at peace than now? Never. There are days where I wonder if it's not all a dream. Well, now you see it's pure reality. If we had kids... this bliss would be complete. But time passes and still nothing. - Good morning. - Good morning, Don Miguel. Blast! Just you wait once I catch you! What is it, Do?a Chole? These pests don't let a person live. All they think on is mischief. I don't know how you and your husband can want kids so much. By the way, have you decided on something? Yes, Do?a Chole. This very afternoon. As soon as I give Pedro his food, I'm going to the doctor. Last night, I started feeling sick again. Putting yourself in a doctor's hands is your choice... But if you need me, all you need to do is call. Thank you, Do?a Chole. Get up, lazy. Don't you plan to wake up? What time is it? Almost four. Have you eaten? Yes, I was starving, that's why I didn't wait for you. Very well. - What happened? - The frying pan fell on me. - What have you done? - I'll just make you new eggs. - What an awful burn! - It's nothing. Nothing? Your hand and arm are seared! - I don't feel a thing. - We need to disinfect it! Some oil and salt will cure it. There. I'll go get the food. Drop it, I'm not hungry. I'm going out. - Where? - To buy a cake for tonight. We need to celebrate our anniversary as if we're rich. - Why don't you join me. - No, I have to go too. So? We'll go together. No, Pedro. Where I'm going, I must go alone. Without you. Hold on! At least tell me where you're going. - I too have surprises in store. - Like what? - If I told you, there'd be no surpr... - You must tell me! Jealous? Me, jealous? Don't be funny, Leticia. If you don't want to tell me, okay! You'll find out tonight. And it'll be something you'll never forget. I can already see the face you'll make when you find out. Well, doctor, am I going to have a boy? I must be sure. Before I can answer, I must ask a few questions. Go on. This dizziness, this nausea... Why did you assume you were having a child? When did it begin? I don't know exactly, but I believe it's been... Two months. - How long have you been married? - Today's been one year. So... not long after I cut off your friend's hand. By the way, what became of him? I don't know. I didn't keep in touch. I don't see my old acquaintances. Marriage has a made a new woman of me. The doting wife of a man like no other. But tell me, doctor. Why all these questions? I came to you because I thought I was having a son. You're right, Leticia. These are all silly questions... Because it's like this... I don't know how to say it. No, ma'am, you're not sick with child. - I'm not having a child. - Not now, not ever. You'll never be a mother. Trust me. But I want it, I've prayed so often to God for it! I'm sorry, but it's the truth. If you don't believe me, see another doctor. He'll tell you the same. I have no reason to deceive you. These spells could be due to your heart. Are you saying I'm ill? Not precisely ill, but I should take a look at your heart. Watch it! You've stuck that spike into your arm! I couldn't feel it if I wanted. - You didn't feel it? - No, doctor. - Did it hurt that time? - Not at all. How strange. Don't move. I'm going to treat you. While I'm at it, I'll change the dressing on your arm. It's poorly done. What happened there? I scalded myself with burning oil. It's my husband who dressed it. In fact, he was as shocked as you when I didn't feel a thing. Burning didn't hurt? No, doctor. Nor when the oil hit me, or when my husband treated me. No, it couldn't be. But doctor, how could I not know if it hurt or not? I'm not referring to whether you felt the burning or piercing. I'm thinking... Something that isn't possible. You're scaring me, doctor. Fine, first I'll treat you... And then we'll see. Don't look and tell me if you feel anything. Here? - I don't feel anything. - Here? - No, doctor. Not a thing. - Feel anything? - No, doctor. Now for the final test. Put your hands on the table and don't move. - What are you doing? Burning me? - Yes. This is very important. Give me your hand. Look carefully. It still doesn't hurt? No, doctor. Why doesn't it hurt? This is ugly. Frightfully ugly. Even a blind man could see it. What do I have, doctor? There's an illness... a terrible illness... Which begins by anesthetizing parts of the body. First to heat, then pain, finally touch. After this, the flesh dies... And the ill begin to rot alive. IT'S LEPROSY! It can't be! It can't be! Yes, Leticia. You're leprous. At an advanced stage. Lies! Lies! I'm healthy. I've never been sick. You're a liar! Calm down, lass, calm down. You're ailment is terrible, but it's not hopeless. Many cases of leprosy can be cured by newly discovered medicines. You could get better. But for that, it'll take many years and an expensive treatment. That's what you're after! My money! You're a thief trying to swindle me by calling me leprous. I'm not telling lies nor am I a thief! I make my living as honestly as God permits. Please doctor, I'll give you all I have and more... I'll rob my husband if necessary, doctor... Just tell me that I'm not ill! That I don't have leprosy! There's nothing your money or your love can do against the inevitable. You saw it just as well as I. You're insensitive to physical pain. If you don't believe me, find any other doctor. Tell them what happened, what I did to you... My God, what will happen to me! Now listen, from this day forward... your life and those around you will have to change completely. My husband could be infected, doctor? Yes, that's why you must tell him what's happened... And isolate yourself from him and prevent it. Both him and society. A leper who, knowing they're ill, does not withdraw from society... commits the lowest of crimes. "There's nothing your money or your love can do against the inevitable." "You must separate from your husband and not infect him." "From him and society." "A leper who, knowing they're ill, does not withdraw from society... commits the lowest of crimes." Two beers ready. What are you doing here? What happened, Leticia? Nothing. A cup of rum, if you have it. - Trouble with Pedro? - No, it's my problem. You fought? How awful! And on your anniversary nonetheless. A stupidity. 'Anniversary...' It's been so long since I've had a drink. It's long overdue. Give me another. - No, that's enough. - I said another! - Fine... Life's not worth a damn. I'm shocked you say that. You and Pedro are such a happy couple. Why should I be happy? Because you are, dear. Because I can see ti. Pedro speaks only of you, how good you are. Why should I be good? Because I'm a quiet wife who sighs with love for her husband? Hey! - Please, no more drinking. - Leave me alone! Come now, woman. Calm down. Everything will work out. - Whatever it is, it's your first fight, and... - That's over, Don Ferm?n. I'm tired of living in a hole, eating the crumbs left by others. I've tired of Pedro. I endured him for a year without protest, but I can't anymore. And does Pedro know all this? What will he do when he does? He'll never find me. To him, I came without warning... And without warning, I left. It doesn't seem noble to leave him like that. He can go to hell. You, too! - Good evening, Don Ferm?n. - What's happening? Leticia wasn't here, by chance? Why exactly do you think she'd come here? Well... I don't know. Pedro and Leticia have no more trusted friend than you. Here... take this and get back to work. Come with me, Pedro. - She couldn't have said that! Liar! - Why would I lie? I thought you'd had a fight. It was inevitable, Pedro, forgive me for saying it... She's not the sort to settle for what you gave her. She was too accustomed to the easy life to forget it. That's it. The easy life. Why didn't I think of it before? I know where to find her. I'm going to kill her. Kill her with my own hands. Don't start trouble, Pedro! If she wants to lead that sort of life, let her. She's not worth it! - Why do you care?! "- ...Who is it? Who is it?" - I'm going to tell you. "Now let me tell you... Now let me tell you... Who is it? Who is it? Pachito E'Ch?! That's who!" Hey you, buy me a glass. Not to meddle, but you've had 6 glasses. And you care, why? If I'm drunk, it's because I'm sad. Alcohol drowns sorrow. Your sorrow must be a cork, because it's still floating. Life is a wheel. You start here... You give it a spin... And you end up where you began. - Let's go! - Unhand me! I never want to see you again! Understand? I stayed a year out of pity! If I owed you for losing your hand, living with you was payment enough. I'm just a floozy. I pay the only way I know how. - You gone crazy? - Leave me alone! You can keep your misery, your hunger pangs. I'm tired of you. Cripple! Disgusting cripple! You make me sick! - Out with you! - Don't touch me! I'll leave on my own. And you, you'll regret what you said. I'll find you and make you pay. Kicks like a mule, that guy. Another whisky. You don't want a drink? - No. - Why didn't you tell me you liked me? - Go away, you're a nuisance! You like me, too. And that kiss... If you like, you and I could... I have plenty of dough for a pretty dame like you. Keep your money. What do I owe? - $42 Let me join you. I have money. Look. - What are you thinking? - Oh, nothing. But you kissed me so suddenly... Listen, buddy, if I kissed you, I had my reasons. I needed him, he who hit you, to see me. - Making him jealous? - To disgust him. Get it? It's time. Remember what you have to do. Take the money to Chueco's, in case they follow us. We'll meet you at the Golden Fly. Let's go. One ticket. - We're closed. Don't move or you'll die. Give us the dough! What? Another assault with the same kind of iron. He just robbed a ticket booth. He's making a fool of us. Tell me, how'd it happen? The Red Cross? I'll send an officer. I'd give one of my eyes just to know who this mystery man is... who all other criminals fear. As I understand it, he's only commited small-time robberies. But the way he brands his victims is brutal. Not one gets away. Now that you're in charge of this case, you should know this detail. Is he just a crook... or insane? Who knows? Carrillo, the detective who investigated before you... thought he was a dangerous madman. He followed several leads, but found nothing. Well, he gave up the case so he wouldn't go crazy himself. Here is all the complete information on his misdeeds. - Nobody's been able to identify him? - Nobody. I've tried imagining a composite based on the victims' accounts... But it seems no one can remember him. All they say is that he's a tall man... wearing a wide-brimmed hat that covers his face... and that he carries a sharp weapon with which he brands them. How strange? The majority of his victims have been defenseless whores... all wounded in the face. And he nevers robs them. Can you explain that? I think we're dealing with a dangerous madman, just like Carrillo. A man who is cruel because he enjoys it... or because he's seeking revenge. Whatever it is, this man's a danger to society. We must find him and stop him as soon as possible. Sooner or later he'll slip up or be sold out. You have carte blanche on this case. Proceed to the Red Cross and see the ticket vendor. They're there treating the wound to his hand. If you need me, I'll be here. I'll be working until morning. Very well, chief. "THE GOLDEN MASK" "With one night worth of love... you appeared into my life... and an immense thirst to love you... is what made me deranged." Boss, doesn't it seem crazy to attack a cinema? If you're afraid, beat it. Boss, it's not that. But we could be doing bigger scores... Why would we want to? So if they catch us, we can do more time in the hole? We don't lack for anything as it is. Very well, boss. You're always right. "...And always yearning for money. That's how you fell into a web... made from your own temptation. I don't reproach you for the deception... nor do I cast you any blame. Even if I loved you truly... it was for you a humiliation." - Joselito's late. You think something happened? - He'll show. "I don't want your money. You don't understand... ...that life... had dragged me down. It took one moment... ...of an affection... treacherous. My destiny... ...fatal in nature... condemned me. You don't know... ...that what I look for... ...what I desire... The comfort... ...of your kisses... ...and your love. Don't stray far... ...from my knees... I beg of you. Don't go away... ...don't leave me here... please, oh, please." No... You're not Leticia. Boss, Chueco needs to see you. He nabbed the guy who beat us to the jewel heist. No! No! You've heard of me? Good! Now you know I don't take half measures. Don't hurt me, please! - And the jewels? - I don't have them. - The truth or you'll regret it! - I don't have them. I swear. Leave him to me, boss. This rat stole a fortune that belonged to us. You'll see how quickly he sings. Wait. I've seen this face before. Where have I seen you? - I don't know. Dont hurt me. I'll spill everything. Don't kill me. The jewels are at my house. You'll see, I'll give 'em to you. That's it. Tony's cabaret. Yeah. I go there often. I'm referring to a night you were kissing a woman... a man came and hit you. - You? - Now you remember, eh? I've been searching for you and her, to kill you. She for betraying me, you for stealing her away. I didn't steal her, I didn't even know her. When you walked in, she just kissed me. After you left, I tried taking her home... But she got furious. Told me that it was all an act to disgust you. Disgust me? Like the way you're lying! It's the honest truth. That's what she told me: she did it to disgust you. After, she told me she was in love with you.. And that she put on the whole act to drive you away. I never forgot her words: "I love him with all my being... but I need him to hate me, because there's something I can never tell him." What was that thing? I don't know. When she finished speaking, she began to cry and left. Some time later, I saw her again but she wouldn't tell me anything. - Then you know where she is? - I see her from time to time. Always alone. Selling herself on the streets. Almost begging. Or drunk, like she's trying to forget something. You'd hardly recognize her. - But where can I find her? - Lots of places. Last time I saw her, a few days ago, was at the Half Moon. Watch him until I'm back. - Need us, boss? - No. You stay here. No worries, boss. "THE HALF MOON" "Why did we ever meet...? Why did we both share the same soul...? If we just lost it all.... And ended up tilling our own misfortune." - What are you doing here? - Well... - Didn't I say I was coming alone? - But... 'But', nothing! Start moving! Stand guard at Chueco's house! - Yes, sir. - Hey, handsome. - Move it! What a brute! - You work this block? - So what? - Plenty! You'll help me. I'm looking for a woman. Is that all? Well, you found her. You should know her. She's on the streets, too. See? And they say she comes around here. She's tall, great figure. There's plenty of that around here. What's her name? She was called Leticia. Now, I don't know. I know! Sullen, doesn't speak to anyone. I once heard her say she's Leticia. - Then you know her? - Sure, I do. She's a rare one. Has no man and no one know where she's from. When she's not drunk, and completely withdrawn... she'll just sit down and cry. A few days ago, I saw her at Desire. - Here, for your information. - $50! - Please, Juanito. Credit me a drink. - No. Only one. Don't be like that. Just one, Juanito. I'll pay you tomorrow. 'I'll pay you tomorrow." I'm sick of the same line. - Just one. - No dice, lady. The lender is busy collecting. Give it, Juanito. I'm sick. I'm good for it, Juanito. Hey, if you'd like I'll pay for it with a song. Fine, but it's the last time. "They say that I'm bad... That I'm a thrill-seeker... Everybody's woman... There's no lack of those who insult me, with no pity in their hearts. I could have been good. I might have been honorable. Poor rose that's gone to wither, blossom that's turned leafless... through playing with love. It don't care what they say of me... I don't even care about yesterday's kisses... Your love should be only for me... the way my love is yours. They say that I'm bad... That I'm a thrill-seeker... Like everybody's woman... there's no lack of those who insult me... without pity in their heart." - That was his companion. - Bruno Landeros, mugger and thief. I know him personally and where to find him this very evening. Are you certain this individual was with the man who assaulted you? Absolutely. I'll never forget the pair. I could pick them out of a thousand without hesitation. Very well. I'll call you when it is time to identify them. Now go home and get some rest. Do you think we'll catch him now? - I'm certain of it. Bruno has done me favors in the past and he won't stop now. We'll soon catch this iron-madman, and with him this Leticia... who he named when he slashed this poor girl. Pedro! How's things, Pancho? What a miracle! It's been so long since you've been here. - Glad to see you. And Don Ferm?n? - What? You don't know? He died 5 months ago. I didn't know. And the business? - He left it to me. Congratulations. - Come, sit, drink something. - No time. I'm in a hurry. Just one glass. Two double tequilas! Right away! I didn't expect you today or ever after what happened. That's why I came. Because what happened. Have you heard from Leticia? - She comes here sometimes. - How is she? Very bad... But she remains pretty. - You spoke to her? - Yes. The first time, she said she was sick and needed money. I offered her work, but she refused. She needed that money. I gave it to her, and I give her what I can when she comes. I need to see her, Pancho. I learned something important tonight. You must help me. Where can I find her? She's overdue for here. It's been a while. But here's a tip... When I close for the night, I often go to a girlfriend's house. Right? She lives near La Reforma, and everytime I pass there... it's rare that I don't see Leticia. I think she works that block. Thanks, old friend. - Going without telling me how you are? - Me? Very good. Just raking in business. I don't know what this business is, nor do I care... But you should know one thing... I'm your friend for always, and if you need it, you always have a job here. Thank you, Pancho. - Next time. - We'll see each other again one of these days. That's him. That's Pedro Uribe. Do you have a cigarette? - I've been looking to kill you! - Kill me then! You can do it now! - This is the luxury you left me for? - The past doesn't matter. - It matters to me! - Kill me or leave me be. - Before that, you'll be mine! - No, Pedro. I can't be yours. I still make you sick? Now I have money! Enough to afford you! That's what you want, right? No, Pedro! Don't kiss me, don't touch me! Visting hours are over. We're closing. Hey! Where are you going? You can't enter. I said you can't enter! What do you want? - I need to use your phone. - Go right ahead. Please, Pedro. Leave me. Why can't you see the truth? The truth? What do you know of the truth? It might be a lie, like the one you told that guy you were kissing at Tony's. - You know? - Yes. And since then I've been searching... So you can tell me this secret I could never know. - You're blind, Pedro. Blind. But not so much I can't see that the only woman I loved in life is now a... A whore! Say what you will. It's all the same to me now. Even death. Anything's preferable to continue living the way I'm living. - Dying... - That doesn't matter to me. Now you'll have to tell me this secret. Please, Pedro, don't torture me more. Have pity on me. Have you had it for me? You asked for it... God knows I'd give my life to spare you this. This is my secret! - What's that? - Leprosy! Leprosy? Yes. Leprosy's eating away at me. My flesh is rotting. Do you see now? Do you see why I did all this? I couldn't infect you, Pedro. I couldn't live with you. Leticia, forgive me. No, Pedro. For God's sake, don't kiss me. Why didn't you tell me? Remember our pact? To always share the truth? Together, thing's would have been less painful. I'd prefer offending you than telling you what happened. Now you know. Forget me. Go find happiness. Leave me. Leave you? Never that! Your pain is not yours alone. We'll stay together until the end. No, Pedro. I'm paying for all my sins. You're innocent. No, Leticia. I'm not innocent. I've changed a lot since we've parted. I've grown to hate women. I've been cruel to them. I, too, need to pay. ?Pedro Uribe! Surrender yourself! You can't escape! I'm giving myself up. Go to a leper colony and get cured. Once I serve my sentence, I'll go for you... Then we'll be together forever. This is how to make them surrender, Captain. Pedro... I'm dying. No, Leticia. Don't come closer, Pedro. It's better this way. We can't kiss until I'm kissing you forever on the other side. Wherever it is you find me, I'll wait for you.
