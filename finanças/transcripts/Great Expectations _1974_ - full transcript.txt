( classical music playing ) Pip: My father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer than Pip. So I called myself "Pip" and came to be called Pip. My first most vivid impression of life was gained on a memorable raw afternoon the day before Christmas. I knew for certain then that my parents were dead and buried in this bleak churchyard. That the dark, flat wilderness beyond the churchyard was the marshes. The low leaden line beyond, the river. Pip: That the distant savage lair from which the wind came was the sea and that the bundle of shivers, fear and loneliness beginning to cry was Pip. Stay still, you little devil, or I'll slit your throat! Now tell me your name. - quick. - Pip, sir. - Where do you live? - I'm from the village, sir. Where's your mother? - Here, sir. - Eh? "Also Georgina." That your father along of your mother? Yes, sir. Late of this parish. Who'd you live with? Supposing I'll let you live, which I haven't made up me mind about. My sister, sir-- Mrs. Joseph Gargery, wife of the village blacksmith, sir. - You know what a file is? - Yes, sir. You know what vittles is? Food. All right, now you get me a file. Get me vittles tomorrow morning. You do it and don't you never dare say a word about your having seen such a person as me. You fail, you'll rot and your liver will be tore out, roasted and ate. I'm not alone. There's a young man here with me. In comparison with which young man, I am an angel. He hears me words. Now you can lock your door, be warm in bed, think yourself comfortable and safe, but this young man will creep his way softly to you and tear you open. Now I have had great difficulty keeping this young man from harming you. What do you say? I promise I'll do it, sir. Say, "lord, strike me dead if I don't." Lord strike me dead if I don't, sir. Yeah, remember what you undertook. Get down. Pip, where you been off to? Mrs. Joe's been out a dozen times looking for you. - Has she? - Yes, she has, old chap. What's more, she's got tickler with her. Mrs. Joe: Joe, is he there? Joe! She's coming. Here. Get this between you and get behind that door. Hurry now! Where have you been, you young devil? I only been up the churchyard. Only been to the churchyard. You'll drive me to the churchyard. I've been out in those marshes one hour looking for you. But do you care what happens to me? Me, your own sister who brought you up by hand? Do you care if you don't have a chore on Christmas eve? No, no, no! It's nothing to you if the floor isn't swept. Nothing to you-- I would have swept it if you'd asked me, my dear. Oh! Anyway, you've done quite enough, Joe Gargery. If it wasn't bad enough making me a blacksmith's wife, you spoil the boy by taking his part against me. Now sweep! ( distant gunfire booms ) - What's that? - Sounds like another convict off. What's that mean, Joe? Escaped, escaped. - But who's firing? - The hulks. Please, what's hulks? Answer him one question, he'll ask a dozen directly. Hulks is prison ships. Right across the marshes. What sort of person would be put in a prison ship? People get put into prison ships because they murder, and because they rob and do all sorts of bad. And they always begin by asking questions. Now sweep! ( groans softly ) ( clock ticking ) ( church bell tolling ) ( man coughs ) I think you caught a chill, sir. I am much of your opinion, boy. It's bad about these parts. You ain't brought no one with you? No, sir, no. No, you're not a deceiving imp are you? Glad you enjoy it. Thank ye. Thank ye. It's all I could do to get the food past him. - Who? - The other young man you're hiding with. Where? Over the far side of the graveyard. - A young man with a-- - Scar down his cheek, yes. Give me a hold of that file quick. Well... if you won't be needing me no more, sir. We got company, you see? It being Christmas, like. My sister would go mad if I'm not home. Go on a rampage. Begging your pardon if there's nothing more. Merry Christmas. ♪ Deep and crisp and even ♪ ♪ Brightly shone the moon that night ♪ ♪ Though the frost was cruel ♪ ♪ When the poor man came in sight ♪ ♪ Gathering winter fuel The compliments of the season. I have brought you, ma'am, a bottle of port wine. This is too kind. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Joe. And I have brought you, ma'am, a bottle of sherry wine. Mr. Wopsle! Woman: and some of my preserves. - Too kind. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Joe. - Merry Christmas to you, my dear. - Joe, Joe, take their hats and coats. - Yes. Man: where's Pip? Mrs. Joe: That boy is never to be found when he's wanted. He'll be the death of me, I know. Man: How fortunate he is. But is he grateful? Woman: Why is the young never grateful? Naturally vicious, they are. How very true. Merry Christmas, Uncle Pumblechook. Mr. Wopsle, Mrs. Wopsle. All: Merry Christmas. Sit down, Pip, please. Joe, Joe, set the punch. Aye-aye, my dear, yes. He doesn't deserve the news I bring. What news? Do you know of Miss Havisham, boy? Everybody's heard of Miss Havisham, uncle. She's the rich lady who lives in the gray house. Miss Havisham sent me a message to find the boy to bring him there tomorrow morning. Me? Why not you? She could make your fortune. Joe: I wonder how she come to know our Pip? She doesn't. She knows dear Uncle Pumblechook. What do I be expected to do like? To play, boy. But they say she's mad. Who says? Everyone in the village. When you're as rich as Miss Havisham, you're not mad. You're just uncommon. Joe. Pip, you don't have to go, lad. But of course he's going. If she wants our Pip to play there, he better play there. Pumblechook: better than ever, ma'am. - A meal fit for a-- - For a king? A sermon, Joe, a sermon. We are showered with blessings here today. True, nephew, true. But now, uncle... Oh! I couldn't. Surely you'll have a little of my savory pork pie. ( flatware clatters ) indeed you must, Auntie. You know there is not another pork pie so delicious in all the county. Wrong-- in all England. We'll do our best with it, ma'am. I'll taste a little to finish. Pip, go and get the pie. Don't ever fear, old chap, you shall have some, too. That boy. Ask him to do anything. He doesn't hear. Joe, cold plates, clean. Gracious goodness, who's gone off with the pie? You're the blacksmith, Gargery? And pray, what might you want with him upon Christmas? A little job done. Been out on a chase. Had an accident with these. As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them? I have to go to my forge to do that. - Convict, Sergeant? - Don't fear. They'll soon find themselves trapped on those marshes. Fix 'em proper now and bring 'em up to us there. Murder! Murder! There they are! Torches! Come on, get them. Come on, move! All right, stop 'em fighting. Break it up. Bring 'em over here. Get 'em up, move! He near killed me, he did. I'd have been a dead man if you hadn't come. - He lies. - I'll make you pay for this, Magwich. Handcuffs! Right, march! I want to say something respecting this escape. I took a file and some vittles in the village from the blacksmith. It was a bottle of liquor and a pie. Have you happened to Miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith? My wife did the very minute you came in. Don't you remember, Pip? You're the blacksmith? I'm sorry. I ate your pie. You're welcome to it as far as ever it was mine. We don't know what you done. We wouldn't want you to starve to death for it. - Would us, Pip? - No, Joe. Right, move! Come on. Come along! Let your behavior be a credit to them which brought you up by hand. Joe: Bless you Pip, old chap. Pumblechook: This is the most uncommon opportunity for you. Not every boy in the village is invited to play at Miss Havisham's. Pip: Any idea what we might be playing, sir? In the halls of the mighty, one must be prepared for everything. Five times six, boy. - 30, sir. - Well done. 9 times 11. - 99, sir. - And 4? 102, sir. Here we are, boy. Now remember, if you're seated when she stands, stand. If you're standing when she's seated-- - Sit? - Stand. Pumblechook: Now, boy, remember not to sniff. ( jingles ) Come, boy. - What name? - Pumblechook. Do you wish to see Miss Havisham? Miss Havisham wishes to see me. She must certainly does not. But I brought the boy. Pip. Pip, is it? Come in, Pip. Boy, let your behavior be a credit to those that brought you. Pip. What a curious name. Well, my true name is Phillip Pirrip, but when I was small, all I could say was Pip, - So I came to be called-- - Come along, boy. Don't loiter. Hurry up, hurry up. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! Pip. ( laughs ) - Go in, boy. - After you, Miss. Don't be so ridiculous. I'm not going in. Who is it? Pip. - Pip? - Mr. Pumblechook's boy come to play. Come nearer. Let me look at you. Come close. Look at me. Are you afraid to look at a woman who has never seen the sun since before you were born? No. Do you know what I touch here? - Your heart. - Broken. Are you ill, ma'am? Merely tired. I need diversion. And I've done with men and women. Play. Play what, ma'am? What does it matter? Sometimes I have sick fancies. I have a sick fancy now to see some play. Play. Play, play! I can't play alone, ma'am. Call Estella. You can do that. Call Estella at the door. Estella! You mustn't shout, boy. Let me see you play cards with this boy. But he's a common laboring boy. What of it? You can break his heart. Beg pardon, ma'am? I said you should play a game of broken hearts. I'm afraid I don't know that, ma'am. Estella will teach you. No, he's a stupid village boy. Anyway, he's much too little. I'm nearly 15. Ha! Then you're smaller than a weasel for your age. I am older than you are. If he's old enough for you to insult him, he is old enough for you to teach him. Teach him. And I will give you a prize. Your own one day. And you will use them well. Now teach him the rules. Teach him. Teach him. The object of the game is for me to capture your knave of hearts. And for you to try to capture my queen of hearts. The winner is the one who ends up with both hearts. ( gasps ) you're cheating. You've stolen my jack. ( gasps ) he calls knaves "jacks," this boy. And what coarse hands he has. Here. You may deal. What a stupid clumsy boy. Here, I'll do it. She says many hard things about you. Yet you say nothing of her. What do you think of her? I think she's very proud. Yes. I think she's very pretty. Yes. - I think she's very insulting. - Yes. - I think I'd like to go home now, please. - You shall go soon. When you have played out the game. I won! I won! I won again. I won again. Come again, after six days. Yes, Miss. Estella, give him something to eat before he goes. Here, boy, here. What is wrong? Was it not to your taste? You can always season it with your tears. I'm not crying. You're crying inside now. But you shall cry outside all the way home. - How do you know? - What else can you do? You're only a common boy. Pip: And Miss Havisham sat in the middle of the room in a black velvet coach. - A black-- - Velvet coach. And Estella handed around cakes on golden plates. Was anybody else there? Four dogs. - Large or small? - Immense. And they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket. What did you play at? We played with flags. Estella waved a red one. I waved a blue one. Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with gold stars. And then we waved swords. Swords? She keeps swords? - Where? - In a cupboard. And there was no daylight in the room. The foyer was all lit with candles. I knew he was lying. No, no, that much is true. That much I've seen for myself. Goodness. Well, there'll be no waving of swords in this house. We don't have no swords, my dear. We do have work to be done. Come on, Pip, old chap. Give us a hand at the forge, eh? It sounds like a wonderful exciting day, Pip. It ain't true, Joe. None of it. It's all lies. Why couldn't you tell us the truth? It was too terrible, Joe. They didn't harm you, did they, Pip, old chap? For if they did, you need never go there again. No, Joe. I want to go back there. There was this proud young lady, Estella. She kept on calling me common. I can prove to her that I'm not. I can learn to call jacks knaves, and deal cards and speak softly. I know I can, Joe. You've all the learning you need to help you at the forge someday. You want larks, we'll have 'em, without no lies. ( clangs ) Are you very angry with me, Joe? No, Pip, old chap. You'll never do it no more, eh? ( blows ) No, Joe, I promise. No dogs, Pip? Not even a puppy, Joe. But there were candles. And even in that darkness, Estella was so beautiful. You're to go this way today, boy. Well... am I pretty? Yes, Miss, you're very pretty. And am I insulting? Not as much as last time, Miss. - Not so much so. - No. Well, you coarse little monster. What do you think of me now? I shan't tell you. Ahh. Because you're going to tell her? Is that it? No, that's not it. Why don't you cry, you little wretch? 'Cause I'll never cry for you. Ahh... Whom have we here? A common boy. A crying boy. Well, you behave yourself. I've a pretty wide experience of boys. You're a bad set of fellows. No need to cry. Tears are no proof of innocence. I wasn't crying, sir. I never said you were. Miss Estella. - Who is he? - Mr. Jaggers. Our legal advisor. But of course, you wouldn't know what a legal advisor was. ( squeaking ) Miss Havisham: What do you think that is? Couldn't guess, ma'am. A great cake. A wedding cake, mine. Come, come. Wheel me. Wheel me. This is my wedding anniversary, Pip. On this day, many years ago, that heap of decay was brought here. It and I have worn away together. The mice have gnawed at it. And sharper teeth than the teeth of mice have gnawed at me. Ahh, the wedding guests have arrived. On this day every year, my cousins the pockets arrive to wish the bride well. Look at 'em, Pip. They live on the hope that I shall never see another anniversary. Tell me, cousin Sarah, how does the bride look today? Beautiful. Come along, Pip. Don't you think this gown a little grand for a country wedding? Oh, no, dear, it's-- it's... perfection. Have you ever seen a lovelier bride? All: Never. Never. Pip, you will give the bride away. - Is she ill? - Certainly not. She sits there on every anniversary. It's her waiting place. - Who does she wait for? - Boy! You have no right to pry into our family affairs. ( faintly ) Pip, run along and play. Oh heavens. Hello, young fella. Who gave you leave to prowl about? Miss Havisham. Did she now? Well, since you're here, come and fight. I suppose I ought to give you a reason for fighting. Well, here it is. ( grunting ) That means you've won. Are you all right? Yes, thank ye. I'm fine. Estella: Boy. Come here, boy. You may kiss me if you like. What's the matter, Joe? Pip, dear old chap, I can hardly say. She fell into one of her rampages. She just lay there with her eyes wide open and her mouth shut tight like a fist. When's she gonna get better, Joe? The doctor won't say. He sent Biddy here to look after her and keep house for us for a while. - Hello, Pip. - Biddy. That means I won't have to stay at home all day. No, Pip. But I would think you might want to. You see, Miss Havisham asked me to wheel her chair once a week and so I promised. I can't break a promise, Joe, now can I? Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip? Yes. Do you like him better now, Estella? I used to despise him, but now I merely hate him. Very good. Break their hearts, my lovely. Is that a new coat you're wearing, Pip? Yes, Miss Havisham. Biddy made it for me. She said I'd quite outgrown the old one. Indeed you have. How long is it since you first came here? Six months, a year? No matter. Don't tell me. Time is of no consequence to me. Look up, Estella. You haven't admired Pip's coat. It's a common-looking coat. What did she make it out of? She made it out of love. Love. Who could ever love you? ( trills ) Pip, wherever have you been? You should have been home from Miss Havisham's an hour ago. Joe wanted you to go to the tanner's. I stopped in high street, Biddy. I bought this book with the money Miss Havisham gave me. "Poems of Londontown." I didn't know you fancied reading. I don't. That's just it, you see? I want to be a gentleman, Biddy. I shouldn't if I were you. I don't think that would answer. But, Biddy, I'm coarse, I'm common, and I'm ignorant. Who said that? Estella. She's the most beautiful girl I ever saw. I admire her something awful. I want to be a gentleman, Biddy, on her account. Do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her over? I don't know. Well, if it's to spite her, I should think it could be done by caring nothing for her words. And if it's to gain her over, I should think she's not worth the winning. Pip, you're not coarse or common. But I am ignorant. I can barely read this book. My sister wouldn't let me go to school more than I ought to. I mean, she said it was wrong of me to learn above my station. Well, I hardly went to school and I can read. How did you learn? I suppose I just caught it, like a cough. Pip, it's never too late to learn. Come. You shall have your first lesson. Bring the peas. We'll start by reading one of those poems. Just pass me the letters one at a time. L-o-n... d-o-n... t-o-w-n. Londontown. Indeed, Pip. Londontown. You may go there when you're a gentleman. Biddy, I shall always tell you everything. Till you're a gentleman. That'll be never. So let's just say always. Pip, you're home. I just saw Uncle Pumblechook. He says Miss Havisham wishes to speak with me. I'm to go along with you on your next visit. Biddy, do you think she wants me to go to school to become a gentleman? Don't, Pip. Joe, you mustn't be afraid of her. She may look strange, but she's the kindest lady in the world. You are the boy's guardian, I understand. Well, ma'am, I married his late sister. When I was single before I were married. Well, I guess I'm your guardian, ain't I, Pip? ( laughs ) You will save your scorn for those who've earned it, Miss. Your admirers. Well, you reared the boy with the intention of taking him as your apprentice. Is that so, Mr. Gargery? No, ma'am. I always look forward to having you at the forge with me, Pip. You being there calculated to lead to larks. Good. Pip has earned some reward for serving us here. Here are 25 guineas. Give them to your new master. It will pay for your apprenticeship. Pip, I never meant to take no money to make you a blacksmith. Estella: Do it, Pip. You'll make a perfect blacksmith. Take it, Joe. Please take it. Goodbye, Pip. Let them out, Estella. Am I never to come here again, Miss Havisham? No. Gargery is your master now. But who will Estella play with then? Estella goes to France next week. She is to be educated there. We have done all that we can do for her here. We have done with you as well. Goodbye, Pip. Leave me. Leave me! Pip: Once it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt sleeves and go into the forge as Joe's apprentice, I should be distinguished and happy. Now that reality was here, life had lost all interest and romance. What stretched out before me was nothing save dull endurance. ( hissing ) ( bell rings ) Dinnertime. Better wash up and finish work tomorrow. You go ahead, Joe. I promised Uncle Pumblechook I'd fix the wheel of his car for tomorrow morning. I'll eat later. As you wish, Pip, old chap. Oh, and, Joe, if you don't mind, would you shut the door? Aye. Pip: What I feared was that on some unlucky night, I should lift my eyes and see Estella looking in at me from one of the forge doors. I was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later, find me at my coarse work. I would fancy she had come at last to surprise me and despise me once again. Biddy. You won't take your hot meal properly in the kitchen, you'll just have to eat it in the forge. Thanks, Biddy. You're not happy, are you, Pip? Well, I must be happy. I have everything a man could want-- food, shelter, work, and when you marry Joe, a proper family. Sometimes that's not enough. Even when you were a boy, I knew you wanted more. Spending all your pocket money on books about faraway places. I feared you'd go off to be a soldier or a sailor. But you stayed faithful to Joe and your work. Biddy, there hasn't been one day I haven't hated this forge. Then you must tell Joe. How could he understand? He loves his work. If I work hard, it's not because I think there's any virtue in hard work, but because Joe works even harder. All I am is restless and discontented. You're not ashamed of what you do, are you, Pip? Yes. And I'm ashamed of the very shame I feel. Oh, Pip, it's been years. You should have forgotten her long ago. She's surely forgotten you. Pip, what for? What's any visit made for, Joe? Yeah, but Miss Havisham might think you wanted-- nay, expected something of her. Pip, old chap, she done the handsome thing by you, and when she done it, she told you that was all. "All" meaning let us make an end of it. I never really even thanked her properly for paying for my apprenticeship. I ought to let her know I remember her. You could send her some present. Uncle Pumblechook could take it for you. You could make her a toasting fork at the forge. Don't go on like that, Joe. I know what I'm doing. Do you, Pip old chap? Yes, I'm going to call on Miss Havisham tomorrow. Are you sure it's Miss Havisham you want to see? Yes, Biddy, it's Miss Havisham. Why are you here, Pip? I hope you want nothing. No, I want nothing. Good. For you'll get nothing. I never give to those who seek. Though I might be generous to one who has abandoned all hope, as I have. You're well, I trust. I still cling to my bad habit of living. I just wanted you to know that I'm almost done with my apprenticeship, and I'm much obliged to you. How is Estella? Still abroad out of reach. Prettier than ever. Admired by all who see her. Quite well, indeed. I'm glad. No, you're not. For it means you've lost her. Lost her. ( laughing ) Lost her. Lost her. Pip, don't go until you have taken this. No. But, Pip, I'm grateful to you for amusing me. You know you are always rewarded when you amuse me. I want nothing of yours. You liar. You want my most precious possession. Estella. Imagine, they call me mad. Yet, he thinks she should be squandered on a blacksmith, a common blacksmith. Common blacksmith. Estella was trained for gentlemen only. Now return to your forge. And if you are fortunate, one day she might ride in a carriage whose wheels you have mended. Pip, we have a visitor. He just knocked, asked if you were here and waited. Jaggers: Joseph Gargery, my name is Jaggers. I'm a lawyer in London. I'm pretty well known. I wish to have a private conference with you two. I keep no secrets from my wife, sir. Very foolhardy principle, Joseph Gargery. But I'm not here to teach you sense. I'm the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow, your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his indentures for his good? You would want nothing for so doing? Joe: Lord forbid I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way. The communication I've got to make is that this young fellow has great expectations. I'm instructed to communicate to him that he will come into a handsome property. Further, that it is the desire of his benefactor that he be immediately removed from this place and be brought up as a gentleman. Now, Mr. Pip, you're to understand first is that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip. Now if you have any objections to that, this is the time to mention it. No. I should think not. You're to understand, secondly, that the name of the person who is your benefactor remains a profound secret until that person chooses to reveal it. If you have any suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. Now if you've any objection to that, this is the time to mention it. - I have no-- - I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position. And that may best be done by removing you to London. You will want some new clothes to come in, and they should not be working clothes. You'll need some money. Shall I leave you 20 guineas? ( pouch clinks ) 20 guineas. As for you, Joseph Gargery, I have it in my charge to make you a handsome present in exchange for his services. Now what do you demand? Speak out. You think I would profit from Pip's expectations? I mean to say, who give you leave to come here and badger me? Joe, Joe, please. Mr. Jaggers means no harm. It's just that he's never had the good fortune to meet an honest man before. Well, Mr. Pip, I think that the sooner you leave here, the better. Someone will meet your coach in London next Tuesday afternoon, and now prepare yourself for the strenuous business of becoming a gentleman. Do you think the crown is too high? Well, Mr. Pip, in London, they're all wearing them high. A tilted front of course. Very rakish, sir. My dear young friend, I give you joy of your good fortune. Well-deserved. Well-deserved. To think that I should have been the humble instrument leading up to this proud reward. Yes, I suppose this one will do. My dear young friend, if you'll allow me-- how dare you take up the time of this gentleman, a child I sported with in happy infancy. But you never had a kind word for him, sir. 'twas I who sang his praises. A kind word? One doesn't flatter a person of quality. I always treated him as an equal. I couldn't have paid him a higher compliment. Here, Biddy. Think what I can do for Joe now. What has Joe to do with this? When I come into my fortune, he need never work in that forge again. But he may not want to be taken out of a place that he likes and fills with respect. How do you know? I know my Joe. He's too proud to live on your fortune. It's not Joe who's too proud, Biddy. It's you. You're envious of my rise in fortune, can't help showing it. It's a bad sign in human nature. Whether you scold me or approve of me, Mr. Pip, will make no difference in my remembrance of you. Joe: Biddy, I'm home. Well, Pip. I've come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham. And I'm so grateful for it. Yes, I saw Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it. So you go tomorrow, Pip. Yes, Miss Havisham. Well, be good. You deserve it. And abide by Mr. Jaggers' instructions. You will always keep the name of Pip, you know? Yes, Miss Havisham. Will you let Estella know of my good fortune? I have already written, telling her about it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Uncle Pumblechook. Goodbye, Pip. Take care. Take care. - Pip, old chap, goodbye. - Goodbye, Joe. Perhaps I could stay here another night with you. Yes, I'll write to London and tell them that-- Pip, you're going today. Goodbye, Biddy. Look, I didn't mean what I said about-- of course you didn't, Pip. Just remember, hold onto your crown in Londontown. - Goodbye. - Proud day. - Bye, Joe. - Go, lad. Bye, Biddy. Look after Joe. - Take care now. - I will. Goodbye. Man: Hey, Mr. Pip! - Mr. Pip. - Yes. - Herbert Pocket. - How do you do? Mr. Jaggers arranged for me to meet you. I've just brought some fruit for after dinner. Well, the fact is I'm half-starved now. Well, here you are. Thank you. Well, come along. I'm to take you to Mr. Jaggers. Then you'll go to your rooms. You'll be lodging with me. Mr. Jaggers has arranged it. Thank you. Man: Mind your backs! Mind your backs! Ah, Mr. Pip. Pocket. Mr. Jaggers hasn't returned from court yet. You're to wait for him inside. Aren't you coming in, too? No, if you don't mind, old chap, I'll stay out here and mind the trunk. The fact is your Mr. Jaggers always makes me feel guilty. And I never know what for. - Never been in London before? - No. I was new here once. Now I know me way about. Is it a very wicked place? Some will cheat you. Some will rob you. Some will murder you in London, but some will do that for you anywhere. Sit down. Oh, Mr. Jaggers. No time now, no time. - Mr. Jaggers, sir-- - Nothing to say to you now. I want to know no more than I know. Have you paid Wemmeck? Yes, sir. I thought-- You thought? That's what I told you not to do. I think for you. That's enough for you. I don't want you to think. I won't have it. I've got a witness what will swear to my innocence. In court, in court. Oh he will, will he? And what will he swear to in court? Whatever you tell him to say, sir. Get out and take your witness with you. - Get out! - Out! Out! Not a word and Wemmeck will give you back your money. Yes, who are you? What do you want? Have you paid Wemmeck? It's Mr. Pip, sir. Just come up to London. Oh, so it is. Well, come inside my office, Mr. Pip. You'll want those. They're cards of honest tradesmen with whom I wish you to deal. You'll find your credit good, Mr. Pip. Don't abuse it. Oh, and you'll want that, too. Your first month's allowance. But-- but it's such a lot. I'll never be able to spend that much. Believe me, Mr. Pip, you will find a way. Of course, you'll go wrong somehow. No fault of mine. Good day to you, sir. ( Wemmeck arguing ) get out, get out, you vagabond. - You may get out! - Jaggers: Wemmeck! Yes, sir? Dear me, this door does stick so. - Let me hold your bag. - Thank you. I thought I recognized you. You're the fighting boy from Miss Havisham's. And you're the prowling boy. The thought of it being you. Amazing. Well, come along. Your room's this way. I do apologize for having knocked you about so badly. Oh, I've quite forgotten that. I suppose you thought I was an intruder. You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time? Oh, no. But what were you doing there? Miss Havisham sent for me that day. I'm one of her poor relations. But she couldn't take a fancy to me. Bad taste, but true. Then you must be one of Estella's cousins. No, Estella's no relative of ours. Then why was she living there? It's quite a story, but you'll have it with your dinner. I'll make some tea. She lavished gifts on him-- carriages, horses, a small estate in surrey. The marriage day was fixed. The wedding dress bought. The cake baked. The guests invited. The day arrived. But not the bridegroom. No, only a cruel letter. Which arrived at 20 minutes of 9:00, when she was dressing for her wedding. The very moment when she stopped all the clocks and retired from the world. Say, Pip, you are quick. But I can't guess anything about Estella. Who is she? Where does she come from? Nobody knows. I only know that Miss Havisham adopted her to wreak vengeance on the whole male sex. She's a demon. Here, you be careful how you talk about her. It's that way with you, is it? Yes. But I know she won't even look at me till I become a gentleman. Pocket, would you help me? Would you teach me how to become a gentleman? I could try. we'll start with dining. In London, it's not the custom to put the knife in the mouth. Also, the spoon is not generally held overhand, but under. Now this has several advantages. You get closer to the mouth and you save a good deal of effort at the elbow. You'll need your elbows for dancing. ( classical music playing ) Pocket: One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Very good, Pip! You are quick. One, two, three. One, two, three. - One, two, three. One, two, three. - ( music stops ) Damn you, Pocket. You'll wake the dead with this racket. Sorry, Drummle, old chap. Just giving my new friend Pip here a few pointers on the dance. You two haven't met, have you? Drummle lodges below us. - Pip's just come to London. - Pocket, I need quiet, not friends. Got to rest now. I've an appointment in Hyde Park at 5:00 in the morning. Do gentlemen really go to Hyde Park that early in the morning? When they're gonna fight a duel, they do. Drummle is the best shot in London. Dangerous chap. Those who know call him "The Spider." Do you think he'd teach me the finer points of dueling? If you call him Spider to his face, he will. Well, Drummle, any friend of Mr. Pip is welcome here. Besides, I like the look of your face. It is a rather distinguished face I've been told. I haven't seen so fine a specimen of the criminal type since they hanged Ben Bailey The Bow Street Ripper. That's his death mask. I defended him, beautifully, I'm obliged to say. But wasn't he hanged? My defense was beautiful. Unfortunately, his crimes were ugly. Mr. Jaggers, I'd like to ask you a favor. - What do you want? - It's not for me. - It's for pocket. - What's he been doing wrong? Nothing, sir. He's been a splendid friend to me, and I'd like to do something for him. You have money enough to do as you choose. But he wouldn't take money from me. What he needs most is employment. I was thinking perhaps you could find him something in the city. Could be arranged. But I wouldn't want him to know that I'd done it. So perhaps you could make it appear that someone was in need of his skills. Certainly. There is nothing our financial world needs so much as a young fellow who can neither add, subtract or multiply. Say no more. He's a clerk in The Bank of England tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Well, gentlemen, a toast to the health of our young friend Pip. May he find London all that he hoped it would be. - Pip. - Drummle: Pip. Thank you. ( laughing ) well, you may be able to use a pistol, Drummle, but when it comes to an arm wrestle, I'm afraid I've got the advantage. - Prove it. - Right. Come on, Pocket! Come on, Pocket! Come on! Stronger! - Care to try me, Pip? - Well, certainly. Think you're a match for me, eh? I'll show you what real strength is. Come on! You're a weakling. Weakling! Jaggers: If you speak of strength, sir, let me show you a wrist you dare not challenge. - Master, please. Master! - Molly. Molly! Show him what a fine lady you are, Molly. Make him bow to you. That'll do, Molly. You've been admired and may go. I never thought a woman could-- she could break your neck with as little trouble if she pleased. I think she killed someone. She's one of the murderers you defended. Wrong. I only said she could kill. I never said she did kill. You must learn never to judge by appearances, Pip. I never do. Why, if I did, I would say that our friend Drummle here was a braggart and a brute. I would say that pocket was a penniless, foolish, good-natured fellow. And that you are really here because you wish to ask me for more money to pay for your London pleasures. Pip. Yes, Pocket, it will do very nicely. Have I forgotten to pay you? Sir, I be looking for Mr. Pip. Joe! Look at you, old chap. How are you? My, but you've growed and swelled and gentlefolked to be an honor to your king and country. And you, Joe, you look wonderfully well. - How's Biddy? - She's well. I'm sorry I haven't been down to see you. But as soon as I have time, I will. This is my good friend Herbert Pocket. Mr. Joseph Gargery. Happy to meet you, sir. My pleasure, Mr. Gargery. Do you take-- tea or coffee, Mr. Gargery? Thank you, sir. I'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself. What do you say to coffee? Since you're kind enough to make the choice of coffee, I won't run contrary to your own opinions. Don't you never find it a little heating? Say tea then. Thank you. Oh, no, do leave it there. Well, I must be off for my job in the city. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Gargery. Any friend of Pip's is a friend-- is a friend of Pip's. - Now, sir. - Joe. How can you call me "sir"? Well, Pip. Your Miss Havisham has sent word to me to bring you a message. I'm to let you know that Miss Estella has come home and would be glad to see you. Estella, she's home? Why didn't you tell me before? Well, I-- I-- I must go down to see her. I must get dressed! Joe, Joe? - You're not going, Joe? - Oh, yes, I am. You'll be back for dinner? Old chap, you and me is not two figures - That should be seen together in London. - Joe! It ain't that I ain't proud, but you shall never see me no more in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, out of the kitchen or off the marshes. You won't find half so much fault in me if you come to the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith in his old burnt apron, sticking down to the old work. So, Pip, dear old chap, god bless you. May you keep ever well, and ever prosperous. Who's your curious visitor? He's-- he's my blacksmith. Take my advice, old chap. Never let 'em know where you live. Once you do, they never stop trying to collect your debts. I'm afraid I owe him far more than I can ever repay. ( playing harpsichord ) Do you find her much changed, Pip? She used to be proud and insulting. You wanted to go away from her. Don't you remember? I have forgotten nothing. Is she beautiful? Graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her? Everyone must who sees her, Miss Havisham. Help me, Pip. I adopted her to be loved. I bred and educated her to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved. Love her. Love her! And is he changed, Estella-- less coarse and common? ( speaking French ) Plus ça change... plus c'est la même chose. She's going to London. I wish her to go out in society. I trust you will be good enough to look after her there. It will be my pleasure. Oh, do you remember the fighting boy? The one I boxed with here? Oh, yes. Well, we're very good friends now. In fact, we share rooms in London. Yes... I remember I enjoyed that fight very much. You rewarded me very much. Did I? Indeed. You let me kiss you. Oh, I don't remember that. You see, I only seem to recollect what pleases me. And you must remember, Pip, I have no heart. Oh, I have a heart to be shot at, to be stabbed at, but there is no softness there. No sympathy, no sentiment and no nonsense. You're jesting. No, Pip, I'm being serious. If we are to be thrown much together, you must believe me at once. Believe me, Pip. Believe me! What's the matter? Are you frightened? I should be if I believe what you said just now. Then you don't. No. Very well. It has been said. You shall shed no tears of cruelty for me today. You shall be my page and escort me to London. We are to meet tomorrow at midday at the Blue Boar Inn and we shall take the London coach together. Mercy, sir, but don't I know you? No. Perhaps we met at the queen's coronation or was it at the races? I said I don't know you. Don't know you. Don't know you. Upon my soul, there ain't a horse in the old village that don't know you. Neigh! Neigh-- ooh! How dare you disturb the peace of this gentleman? Be off with you. I hope, sir, you won't take an unfortunate view of this happy village because that boy failed to recognize a man of quality. - My name is-- - Pumblechook. Why, it's Mr. Pip! Imagine finding you at home again. I only stayed here overnight, Uncle Pumblechook. Visiting Gargery's? No, I stayed at the Blue Boar. Of course. One wouldn't expect you to spend the night in a blacksmith's cottage. I most certainly would have stayed if only-- well, I-- if it were convenient. You see, this was a sudden visit. I was not expected. You must allow me to buy you a drink. Let's drink to fortune. May she ever choose her favorites with equal wisdom. Some other time. I have to meet a friend here. Good day. ( sighs ) I thought I'd never get away. Miss Havisham had endless instructions. I wonder that she can bear to part with you again so soon. That is part of her plans for me. Estella is to write to her constantly regarding her progress. Estella and her jewels. They are almost all Estella's now. Why do you speak of yourself as if you were someone else? Does it displease you? No, but it confuses me. You must not expect me to change for you, Pip. I shall talk and live in my own fashion. This is my purse. You are to pay the coachman with it. No, I have more than enough. Please, Pip. We have no choice, you and I, but to follow our instructions. We're not free to follow our own impulses. I'm very free to follow mine. Will you never take warning? Never. As far as you're concerned, I'm quite fearless. Then after we take the London coach, you may watch me take London. ( waltz music playing ) ( music stops ) Miss Estella, remember you promised me the next dance. Nonsense, I have your solemn promise you'd save the next dance for me. Oh, I have a most appalling memory. I have promised the next dance to my dear friend Pip. ( music playing ) - Shall we dance? - Estella, I must speak with you. Then speak, my dear Pip, as we dance. You've scarcely noticed my existence tonight you've been so occupied - in dazzling your friends. - That is more your fault than mine. Indeed. Your jealousy has made an admirer of every man who approaches me. Nonsense. You lead them on. But you are my old friend. Oh, yes, you allow me certain privileges you deny the others. Only because you dismiss my love as meaningless. Is it your wish to torment me? What other choice do I have? My other admirers are even more tiresome than you are. You're tired, aren't you? Rather, Pip. You should be. Rather, I should not be. I have given my word to a dozen more dances. Six of them to Bently Drummle. Now look at him, staring at you. Hardly a pretty sight I must confess. He's been hovering about you all evening. Moths and all sorts of ugly creatures hover around a lighted candle. Can a candle help it? I can't bear that people should think you'd throw yourself away on such a bore. Why, I've seen you give him looks and smiles tonight and such as you never give to me. Do you want me to deceive and entrap you? Do you deceive and entrap him? Yes. And others. All of them, but you. Here's Mr. Drummle now. Not another word. Excuse me. ( thunder crashing ) Pip: I was determined that Estella should know of my love for her, and that she should not be allowed to throw her life away. I set about writing, asking her to become my wife. - ( thunder crashes ) -( knock on door ) Mr. Pip? That's my name. Well, what's your business? My business-- I'm gonna explain within, by your leave. - No one else here, is there? - Why do you ask? You're a game one. Glad you growed up a game one. I could tell that when you were a boy on them marshes. Even then you was a game one. It wasn't every lad what would comfort a poor convict with vittles. You. Don't be afraid. There's no iron on me feet now. You acted nobly, me boy. Abel Magwich has never forgot you. Me noble Pip. If you're grateful to me for what I did as a child, it's not necessary. Surely, you must understand. Surely I must understand what? I cannot now wish to renew our acquaintance. You're wet and you look weary. Will you have a drink before you leave? Good health. How have you been living? I've done wonderful well. I'm famous for it. I'm glad to hear it. I'm a sheep farmer, a stock breeder, in the new world. You were deported to Australia? Yeah, bloody likely. No, they was taking me to be hanged, but I escaped. Ain't no prison ship could hold Abel Magwich. ( thunder rumbles ) May I make so bold as to inquire how you have done so well since you and me was out on them shivering marshes? I-- I was chosen to succeed to some property. Oh. Might a mere varmint inquire, what property? I don't know. Could I make a guess I wonder at your income since you've come of age? As to the first figure, now a 5? Concerning your guardian, some lawyer maybe, as to the first letter of the lawyer's name, would it be a "j"? and would he tell you you was always to go by the name of Pip? And you was never to ask who it was what made a gentleman of you? Yes, Pip, my dear boy, it's me what's done it. I swore that time soon as I ever got a guinea, that guinea would go to you. I lived rough so that you could live smooth. I worked hard so that you could be above work. Do I tell you for you to feel an obligation? Not a bit. I tell it for you to know that this hunted dunghill dog what you kept alive got so high, he could make a gentleman. And you're it, Pip. I'm your second father. Now don't mind me talking, Pip, you ain't looked forward to it as much as I have these many years. Did you never think it might be me? Never. Never. Was there no one else? No one. Who else would there be? Eh? It wasn't easy for me to come back here. Wasn't safe neither. But at last, I've done it, dear boy. I've done it. Now then, where you gonna put me? Eh? My friend Pocket is away on business. You can have his room until he returns. ( thunder rumbles ) look at these lodgings of yours. Fit for a lord. Why'd you do that? Caution. It's death for me to be found here in England. Surely, after all these years, there's no one looking for you. Somebody is. He'd stop at nothing to find me. You remember that young man with the ugly mug, what was hid with me in the graveyard. My enemy. He'd seek me out for the reward. Not to mention the joy of seeing me hanged. Well, don't fear. You're quite safe here because I owe you safety. And I repay my debts. Spoken like a real gentleman. Ah, me boy, I have great plans for you and me. I've scarcely scratched the top of me fortune. You'll live like a bloody prince. And I'll have the joy of seeing it with me own eyes. But why me? Surely you must have some relation. No, no, there's no one. Had a daughter once, what I lost. Now I have a son what I found. I merely wish to know if what I've been told is true. Did you say told? Or informed? Told would seem to imply verbal communication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in Australia. I have been informed... that Abel Magwich is my mysterious benefactor. That is the man in Australia. But I'd always supposed it was Miss Havisham. I am not responsible for that. Not a particle of evidence. Take nothing on his looks, Pip. Take everything on evidence. There is no better rule. Pip, now that your mysterious benefactor in Australia has disclosed himself, I trust he has heeded my advice. I wrote to him in Australia that he must never return to England or he would render himself liable to the extreme penalty of the law. Is that clear? Quite clear. Good. He has been guided by my advice, no doubt. No doubt. He must be got out of England safely. Indeed, but he'll never go unless I agree to go with him. You'd leave Estella? Herbert, he's risked his very life to join me here. After all he's done for me, it's the least I can do for him. Now once he's safely settled abroad, then I'll return and ask Estella to marry me. ( knock on door ) - Who is it? - Drummle. Pip, old chap. I have a favor to ask. I'm going to take a journey to your part of the country. I loathe marshlands, still, I've no choice. Know a decent inn where I might stay the night? Yes, The Blue Boar. Hmm. well, I don't plan to stay long, but Estella insists upon speaking with her old guardian before we go off. What have you to do with Estella? Haven't you heard? Estella has agreed to marry me. You lie. My dear fellow, I never lie to my inferiors. Tell me you're lying. Pip, Pip, no! Don't worry, Pocket, I don't take offense at that. The blacksmith's boy is never too far from his forge, is he? Pip, what happened? Pip, you can't leave now. Try to arrange a boat passage for Magwich and me while I'm gone. I'll be back in London tomorrow. Pip, where are you going? Estella, I swear, I will never trouble you with my love again if you refuse him now. Oh, Pip, I'm a most imperfect woman. I possess every fault, save one. I do not delude myself. I will marry Mr. Drummle because I am weary of my life. And I am willing enough to change it. With his wealth and position, he can afford to keep so precious an object as myself. Cold heart. You will go now and never see us again. Take these too. I do not want them. Look at her. So hard. So thankless in the house where she was reared. Who taught me to be hard? Who praised me when I learned my first lesson in pride? And when I was a child, who sat before me with a face so strange and frightening teaching me hard lessons? Well... now you no longer frighten me. Pity. The only way you could stop the time was by breaking all the clocks. I will marry Drummle tomorrow at his estate. You may come if you wish. You know I cannot leave this house. As you will. But I must leave now. I cannot bear this place a moment longer. Estella. No more. You will find someone better suited to your love. All this will pass in time. - Never! - Indeed? Oh, Pip, you will have forgotten me within the week. Forget you? Oh god, that I could. You have lived in every thought I've ever had since I first came here a rough laboring boy. You will remain part of the little good left in me. A part of the evil as well. Take these, take these. Take them. Take them. Come back. Estella, come back. Come back! Come back, Estella. ( door slams ) Oh. What have I done? I meant her no harm. Who were her parents? I wanted a little girl to rear and to love, to save from my fate. Jaggers... Jaggers found me an orphan. So beautiful. But my drills, my lessons... I stole her heart and put pride in its place. Who were her parents? I don't know. He wouldn't tell me. Does Estella know? No. She was scarcely two years old when she arrived here. Is there no clue? Anything? Wearing a little torn gown and a tin locket. There's an inscription on it. "Molly mag--" Magwich. Magwich. Does that name mean anything to you? Don't go, Pip. I'm afraid to be alone. Why not ask in the village for another child to come here to play? Oh! Pip, Pip! Pip! ( screams ) Pip! Help me, Pip. Oh, Pip. ( gasps ) Pip. Dear Pip. I never meant you to suffer as I did. Forgive me. Of course I do. I would have loved her in any event. ( faintly ) Forgive me. I'll put a case to you. Mind, I admit nothing. But you must tell me. Put the case of a lawyer who lived in an atmosphere of evil, suffering. Put the case that he saw the children of convicts, whipped, neglected, cast out, growing up only to be hanged themselves. Put the case that one pretty child out of this dung heap could be saved. The father a convict, her mother a murderess. ( ringing ) Both parents living under this lawyer's power. Molly, take this away. Put the case that the lawyer saw the chance for this child to be raised in comfort and security. Put the case that this secret remains a secret except that you have stumbled on it. Then Molly is Estella's mother and Magwich her father. This must be made known. For whose sake would you reveal this? For the father's? For the mother's? For Estella's sake! If Drummle knew, he'd never marry her. Ah, you'd save her, is that it? You drag her into disgrace after 20 years? She's chosen her own fate in Drummle, remember that. What right have you to choose another for her? If you must save someone, I think you might look a little closer to home. Pocket! Magwich: I'm in here. Good morning. Look what I have here. Have you had an accident? It's nothing, nothing. Where's Pocket? Your mate's gone to buy the steamship tickets. But we'll have a good time in Holland, won't we? Well, we'll certainly try. Now we must make certain you run no risk of being recognized at the pier. So we'll dress ourselves as seamen. Then we'll row out to the boat and hail it as late-arriving passengers. We'll board the boat from the security of the river. - It's all right. - There, fine. Well, if all goes well, you'll be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours. Man: Thank you, sir, thank you. ( slight thump ) - Pocket: what was that noise? - Where? Back there. I can't see anything. Well, let's go. ( engine whirring ) There's the steamer! There's a galley behind us. Ahoy, there. Passengers for boarding! You have an escaped convict there. That's the man. Abel Magwich! Officer: I apprehend that man. I call on him to surrender and you to assist. - Here. - ( shouting ) Get back in the boat! Magwich! Magwich, look out! Magwich! Magwich! ( screams ) Magwich, we're here. Got him now. Pull him in. ( panting ) Magistrate: Abel Magwich, you are hereby sentenced to die for your crimes. And all your possessions to be forfeit to the crown. Don't look so sad, dear boy. This way, I cheat the hangman. If I'm sad it's to think that you came home for my sake. I was content to take me chance. I've seen me boy. He can be a gentleman without me. I'm no gentleman. I'm not fit to judge, but you are. A very gentleman. You ain't missed a day... these two weeks. Magwich. Magwich, can you hear me? You had a daughter who you thought was dead. She lived. She's living still. She's a great lady. And I love her. Magwich. Lord, be merciful to him. Joe. How long have you been here? You been ill quite a while. And you've been here all the time? Pretty nigh, old chap. When your friend Mr. Pocket wrote you was ill, Biddy says to me, "Joe," she says, "you must go and look after him." Dear Joe. Ever the best friend. Well, I say, you seem fit today. Doesn't he, Joe? Indeed he does. I'll go put up some tea. Don't let him go overdoing the talking. - How are you, Pocket? - Splendid, Pip. As fit as ever. You must have had a lot of exercise keeping the bailiffs from the door. As a matter of fact, Pip, Joe paid some of your debts himself. Joe? Pocket, you know I won't allow that. - Joe-- - Please, Pip. Don't call him. He won't come. He left you this note. Try to understand, as soon as the word was out you'd lost your good fortune, they came for the furnishings. Well, Joe didn't want you to recover in a bare bedroom without any comforts. "Not wishing to intrude I have departed, for you are well again, dear Pip, and it's time I returned home to Biddy. Ever the best of friends, Joe." Amazing. She's taught him to write. Well, there's nothing, for it Pocket, but to repay him. Perhaps I should go back to the forge, if Joe will have me. Pip, there's no turning back. Like it or not, you're a gentleman now. Rubbish. I was merely a snob, an ingrate. If that's being a gentleman, I'll have no more of it. Then you'll just have to go to work with me. Oh, no, Pocket, I must leave London. Yes, I hear there's a place for any young man who's not afraid of a lot of heat and little work. Well, you've been in a forge, so you can bear the heat. And I've been in a bank, so I can bear the work. So together, we should go to India. India? India. Why not? ♪ Good King Wenceslas looked out ♪ ♪ On the feast of Stephen ♪ ♪ When the snow lay 'round about ♪ ♪ Deep and crisp and even... ♪ Pip: For 11 years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy-- though they both had been often in my thoughts-- when on one Christmas Eve, an hour or two before dark, I knocked softly at the cottage door. - Joe: Happy Christmas. - Pip: Cheers. When we give him the name of Pip, we thought he might grow a little bit like you. - Oh, no. - We think he do. No, he's a much better-looking lad than I ever was. I think he favors his mother. Now look, you will send my godson to me on holiday visits now I'm to settle in London again. Better you married and had a son of your own. That's what Pocket and his wife are always saying, but I don't know. I don't think I ever will. I'm quite an old bachelor. Uncle Pip, do they really wear rubies in their noses? Boy: Did you really ride elephants and charm snakes? - ( knock on door ) - It's Uncle Pumblechook. Go on, lad. Let him in. You don't mean you invited him here to spoil the boy's Christmas? He's all alone in the world. It is Christmas. Truth is I don't invite him. He appears. Merry Christmas, Uncle Pumblechook. Compliments of the season, ma'am. I brought you a bottle of port wine. Thank you, Uncle Pumblechook. Pip, pass the bowl to Uncle Pumblechook and be certain to save something for yourself. You'll spoil that boy by pampering him. How else will he grow up to be a fine gentleman like his Uncle Pip? Why, it's Mr. Pip, made his fortune in India with tea and spice. I'd very much like to hear about that trade. - Merry Christmas, Uncle Pumblechook. - Merry Christmas, uncle. What I always say is one's never too old to learn from a young one. Get out of tea as soon as you can. Get into railroads. If I was a young man, I'd risk my future in steam. Do you know they're building a railway station - Right here in the village? - Indeed? Yes. Miss Havisham's old place. Didn't I take you there once to play? No matter. It's all coming down now. Making way for progress. Excuse me. - What's wrong, Pip? - Forgive me, Biddy. I'll return shortly. I must see that house again. Dear Pip, after 11 years have you not forgotten her? Biddy, I've forgotten nothing in my life that ever was important to me. Why else would I return from India to be with you and Joe? I'll just slip out through the forge. Estella's voice: Come along, boy. Don't loiter. Estella's voice: Pip. ( laughs ) Miss Havisham's voice: Forgive me. I never meant you to suffer as I did. Estella's voice: Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! Miss Havisham's voice: I said that you shall play a game of broken hearts. Estella's voice: Don't be so ridiculous. I'm not going in. Estella: Pip? Yes. Well, are you afraid to look at me? I am greatly changed. Estella. I wonder you still know me. Do you often return here? No. No, I have not been here since the night I left to marry. I wanted to see the old house once before it was torn down. Are you still living abroad? No, no, I returned yesterday. You do well, I'm sure. I work fairly hard for my living. Yes, I suppose you could say I've done well. I have often thought of you of late. You have? ( chuckles ) What ridiculous children we were. Both trying to master our own lives. Yes. Ahh... you have forgotten. No. I've never forgotten you. After Drummle was killed in Paris, I went to Germany for a while. He was just as you said he was, Pip. He made my life an agony once he learned my secret. Jaggers told him? Jaggers? How should Jaggers know? I told Drummle myself shortly after we were married. But I had married him to escape from loving you. You-- you loved me? From the first moment I saw you at the gate-- that boy that was sent here to play-- till the last time we parted. Oh, how frightened I was that you would discover my secret. That I would suffer the same weakness as she had. Thank heavens we outlive our fears. Estella, you are lovelier today. Pip, please don't. I know what I am. I'm like this place-- wasted and broken. Nonsense. You are softened by time, no more. Pip, I have not lost my pride. I will not be pitied. Pity you? For god's sake, why should I? Why should anyone pity a woman who is so greatly loved? It is too late for us now. Let us part friends. No, Estella, friends will quarrel. Friends will part. We're long past friendship. Now come here, boy. You may kiss me if you like.
