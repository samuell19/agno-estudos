Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - She left at 1:26, sir. - Jolly nice of her. She's probably ordered the pilot to take her for a joy ride over Paris. - Will you wait much longer, sir? - We'll wait for a week if it suits her. Her grandfather practically owns this line. They'd sink the blooming boat to please his precious granddaughter. Here she is, sir. - Come on, she's here! - Hooray, come on! Miss Holt. Miss Holt, we've arrived. Mais le b?teau devait partir depuis minuit. The ship was due to sail at midnight. She's waited two hours already. The ship, Miss Holt, the ship. Merci. S'il vous pla?t. Attention. Pardon me, young man. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Mustn't be impatient, ma'am. That's Miss Ann Holt. Heiress to the biggest fortune in America. - How nice for her. - Oh, yes. - Everything is supposed to wait for her. - Uh-huh. Good morning, Grandmother! Young man, you're perfectly right. What she needs is a good walloping. - Where have you been? - What's the big idea? - Well, it's about time. - Who do you think you are, anyway? How nice of you all to be so glad to see me. How are you, sweet? - Hello, dear! - Hello, Ann, how are you? You heard me, where have you been? Dear old darling, did we have a time? - Everyone was there, you missed it. - And you missed the boat train. - Hm-hmm. - Look at yourself! And your feet, they're soaking. Can I help it if I slipped? And very wet water in these parts too. You come and get right out of those clothes. Do you think by any chance I won't get double pneumonia? The only thing that'll save you is a hot rum. - You're right. - No, you don't! You're going to get into a steaming bath this minute! But don't you see, I just had a cold one, ducky. Don't you ducky me. Scatterbrains! Stewardess. Yes, Mrs. Holt? I want some kind of a tub for a foot bath and a large can of mustard. Yes, mum. English or French mustard? It's immaterial to me what language it speaks! What excellent service, just what I wanted. But Miss Holt, this drink is for the gentleman over there. Mustn't keep the young lady waiting. Let that be a lesson to you, Crawford. Put that down! Such is my intention, dearie. Do you want me to carry you to your cabin? - You're not man enough, darling. - Oh, I'm not, huh? No, Granny, no, no, no... - Where to, ma'am? - I'll show you. Pardon me, these might scratch you. This way, young man. Do you charge by the mile or is it a flat rate? Do you mean to say you were a physical wreck before you used Peptona? We're off! That's fine. Now get some towels. That was charming. Next time, driver, we'll go through the park. - Radio? - No, thanks. I'll just wait and see it in the newsreel. Young man, any time I can do you a favor... - Not at all, it was a pleasure. - Oh, sir... To help you out, Mrs. Holt. - Good morning. - Good morning. Goodbye. Pick me up again sometime. Now take off that dress! But he's gone! Oh! Hurry up! - You had me worried to death. - I told you I'd make the ship. Yes, but when? You're darned lucky they waited for you. Come on, get in this chair! Stop bullying me! Landing on this boat like a three-ring circus. Ouch! Sadist! You never could drink anyway. I'm the only one in the whole family who knows how to handle liquor. Wiggle your fingers around in the water and stir up this mustard. I wonder who he is. As fine and upstanding a young fellow as I've seen in many a day. Amen, sister! And you won't get anywhere with him either. Why, darling? Because he thinks you're just a spoiled brat. In spite of which, I wonder. Sorry, Miss Holt. - What did the purser say? - He says his name is A. Gage. But he can't sit him at your table... ...because he wants all his meals sent up to his state room. You go find this here A. Gage and tell him I need a fourth hand at bridge. Righto! Success to you! - Ann! - Oh, Anne! Coming. # For he's my man... # Maybe. How are we doing? Come here and let me gouge out your eyes. - Always ready to oblige a friend. - You're done for, dear. - Doubled and vulnerable. - Take a look at that score, palsy. That's thirty-six hundred more you owe me. Chisler. As soon as we land, I'll get my allowance. So sorry, darling, but double-entry bookkeeping has always baffled me. Darling, I wouldn't tax your brain for anything. Choose yourself a bauble, they're all worth hocking. Hmm... I'll take this one. That one, Rita, my fine woman, is the only one you can't have. Bill gave me that. - Who's Bill? The prince? - Ha! Bill is my father, and a man, my friend, a man! - Hm, sounds as if you like him. - Right, he's my pal. - And being his mother, I might add... - Sold, sold! After which demonstration of fine family feeling, take your pick, little one. - Can I have the pearls? - Pearls it is. - Never mind, Nina, I'll go. - Bien, madame. You can hold this securely, but notice I cast them before you. She's calling you a swine, Rita. Some of my best friends are swine. - Now, Hodges! - I did the best I could, miss. - Where is he? - In the gymnasium. Ahoy! So this is how you keep in condition to carry women. Haughty, I calls it. Very pretty. - Hello, A. Gage. - Hello. - What does the A stand for? - Anthony. Oh... And the Gage is some sort of plum? A gauge is a standard of measurement. A measurement of quality. - A. Holt. A stands for Ann. - Yes, I knew that. - Oh, you've been reading the papers. - Yes. Congratulations on your engagement to Prince Carlos. Thanks... and very pleasant it was too. Oh, I'm sure of that. - You sound kind of resentful. - Oh, no, not at all. Quite normal for a rich gal to buy herself a title. Say, what do you know about my engagement? I happen to work for the law firm that handles your grandfather's interests. This alliance is setting him back plenty. You sound a little bit like him, "dour". - Hm? - "Dour" is Scotch for sour. Do you speak Scotch? In my little circle gentlemen usually answer ladies. I know all about your little circle. This man shows every sign of having a terrible crush on me. He's not letting himself in for anything so umpleasant. Unpleasant? You have no idea how nice I can be. I've also no idea of being a little episode to brighten up the voyage for you. I'm way ahead of you. So you are. We'll soon fix that. - My horse always wins! - I wouldn't say always. You big brute! But you haven't beaten me in the important thing yet. - Let me help you. - Oh, go away! Don't you strike me. So you don't find me attractive. Oh, yes, you're a very desirable creature. And very potent. But you're too used to snapping your fingers and having everyone toe the mark. - Most men love it. - I must be exceptional. That's what intrigues me. Hey, you really are trying to start something, aren't you? Hm-hmm. - My dear Miss Holt... - I hate to be formal! - You're utterly charming. - Ahhh! - But you've been badly brought up. - Spoiled. All your worst qualities have been thoroughly developed... ...and your good ones left to rot. I like you too. You're clever and attractive, but you've got nothing to back it up. No standard. In other words, I need "A. Gage". No, you're impossible. Well I'll be a... Hey... attendant! Attendant! # What's the use of worrying # # Your young mind away # # Trouble may come hurrying # # But it's a nice day today # # Smile while you go along # # As you were at play # # Happily just sing a song # - I'll take that bet. - You're on. Is this a zipper? Four all for our side. Now, don't pay me yet. I'll give you a chance to win a bet. I bet you can't say "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers." I'll bet I can. Peter Piper plicked a pleck... No, wait a minute. Pleter Pliter plicked... You owe me a hundred now, come on. Oh, it's a racket. Where are you going, Ann? Big Gage hunting. Well, as I live and breathe, if it isn't A. Gage. I've looked all over this boat for you. I always say, isn't it a small world? That what I always say. Too small sometimes. If I'm not too inquisitive, might I ask for the pleasure of this dance? - It's too hot in there. - It's mighty cool out here, Colonel. Well, if you don't mind, I'll do the leading. You know, I have a queer feeling you and I have danced like this before. All alone on the deck of a ship. We have. We did, years ago on our honeymoon. - Our what? - Our honeymoon. Oh yes, of course. My wretched memory for faces. Well, you see, it was such a brief honeymoon. Marriage took place too soon after our meeting. Would you mind refreshing my memory as to where we met? - On your grandfather's desk. - Desk? Where I first saw your picture. Oh! And so we were married. - Were we awfully happy? - Well, at first yes. But when you started flaunting those big income checks... from your grandfather in my face... You've got it all figured out, haven't you? - Oh, yes. - You're funny. Thank you. Well, go on. Was I mean with my money? No. As a matter of fact, you showered me with gifts. With platinum suspenders, and knickknacks and things, huh? Yes. And a new punching bag... ...when I liked my old one. You know, those are the things that wear a man down. And so we parted. It had to come. - Aren't we going to finish this dance? - Well, someday, maybe. In other words, you threw me over for an old punching bag. And there's no chance for reconciliation? Impossible. The last time you said impossible you kissed me. Well, I assure you it won't happen again. Young man! How much have you had to drink today? - Oh, fifty or sixty highballs. - Good, I thought maybe you'd been drinking. - How'd you like to make a little pin money. - Sounds interesting. I'll bet you $10 you can't say "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers." - Just ten dollars? - I'll make it more if you want to. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. - Pertly pecking pretty pippins... - Stop! Don't waste it! You and I have a floating gold mine on this ship. Come on! You know, I like that man. Mind if I take a shot at him tomorrow? If you don't mind my taking a shot at you. What about your engagement to the prince? That was all B.G. Before Gage. It was grandfather's idea anyway. This is going to complicate matters, isn't it? Don't count on it, ducky. I generally get what I want. They play too many waltzes. I like to rumba. - Oh, Captain! - Yes, Mrs. Holtz. - Got a new one for you. - What will it cost me this time? I'll give you five dollars if you say it. I hope you win, skipper, just to break her. - Is it as difficult as the one yesterday? - Worse. Now listen. This is better than rubber buggy bumpers. Uh... again. This is better than rubber buggy bumpers. This is better than ruggy buggy... This is better than rubber bubby gumpers... I give up, I give up. - You stayed up too late last night. - How did you know? - Well, I was around myself. - I thought so. Hello. Do you realize you haven't been near me in days? Yes, I realize that. I'm in love. I assumed that when you agreed to marry the prince. I'm in love with you. Why don't you stop playing for once in your life? I'm not playing, I mean it. Tony, tomorrow we land. We may never see each other again. That might be better for both of us. Why are you so mean to me? Perhaps it's my instinct for self-preservation. This is the first time I've ever felt this way about anybody. Oh, Tony, can't you believe me? I'd like to, but I don't. Why don't you go and dance? - We've got to get some of our money back. - Hey, Ann. Here's one for you. I'll bet you ten bucks you can't say "This is better than rubber buggy bumpers". What's the matter with you? Why, you're crying. Waiter. You boys figure it out. I'd at least like to be at the house when Ann gets there. Check, please. - But Bill, this is serious. - I know it's serious, but I haven't seen my daughter for a year. Why get excited? The Puritan Bank can't be in a jam as long as Bill is president. Thanks for the boost. He means Jerome Cedric. What's my father-in-law got to do with it? He'll help us out because of you. Tell him the desperate condition we're in. That we need this money or the bank will close its doors. - He'll come through, I'm sure he will. - Oh, will he? He's been pretty lavish with your daughter. What he sees fit to do for Ann is his business. I'd see myself dead before I'd take a penny of his money. Well, we've got to get it somewhere. Well, I'll be at the bank later. I'll do anything you fellows advise. But I will not go to my father-in-law. Bill! - Darling! Darling! - Ann, my darling! - Oh, my sweet! - I'll swear you're prettier than ever. How did I ever let you get away from me? Of course I'm only his mother, but I've come back from Europe too. My old sweetheart! - How are you feeling, kid? - Marvelous, till you've fractured my rib! - You look marvelous, Miss Holt. - Thank you, Annie, it's nice to be home. - Kept everything nice and clean? - Yes, madam, I've tried to. Oh, pretty swell to have my two gal friends back home. Swell for the gal friends. As if he'd been true to us while we were away. Cheerie little mausoleum, isn't it? Fine example of Cedric taste. It was pretty ghastly with you away so long. Well, I'm home now, darling, and I'll never leave you again. Will you two stop blocking traffic, step on it! It's worse than a couple of old ladies. You dog, why didn't you meet me at the boat? I was having lunch with a new Follies queen. Liar! You'd never stand me up for another woman. - Bill, how sweet! - Model of my little monoplane. I sort of went in for flying to deaden the monotony. You that owns your own plane. - Come aboard? - Aye aye, captain. - I missed you like the devil. - I missed you too. Wait till you see what I brung you. You brung me yourself, that's enough. - Still care for my Alexanders? - Do ducks quack? Good old Bill. Gosh, pie face, I don't know how I'm going to get along without you. Maybe you won't have to. - A great big maybe. - What do you mean? It'll be goodbye forever when you marry your prince. Will you join me in a moment's silence about the prince? A moment's silence it is. And that, ducky, finishes the entire conversation we'll have about him. Come clean, honey. What's up? Well, it's a long, sad story and rather difficult to tell. Lady, you can tell a bartender anything. Bartender, for the first time in my life I'm really in love. - You don't tell me. - Met him on the boat. Got it bad? Head over heals, daffy, delirious, dithery. - I even dream about him. - Lady, that is love. - What's his name? - Gage. Anthony Gage. He's connected with grandfather's attorneys. Why don't you have him up to dinner sometime? I'd sort of like to meet him. The gent will have none of me, bartender. He walked off the blinking boat without even making a date, say call up or anything. Sounds like a sissy to me. No, he likes me but he won't give in. He thinks I'm a spoiled brat. So you are, lady, so you are. Oh! Gosh, I'd like to see your grandfather's face when he hears about this. Oh, boy! Telephone, Mr. Holt. Mr. Burkhardt from the bank. Tell him I'm out. And tell him I told you so. Those fellows get hysterical down there when the least thing comes up. Bill, is anything worrying you? Certainly not. Why? Seems to me there's a lot more gray around those temples. Well, that's to add to my sex appeal, honey. You're sure it hasn't anything to do with the bank? Come on, darling, we always tell each other everything. Nothing to tell. Money's a little bit tight everywhere. The bank's all right. Here's to us. But mud in your grandfather's eye. Luck to you, Bill. Is that the only record in the house? The only one I like. - Ann about ready? - She'll be here any minute. You didn't tell her, did you? You think I go around blabbering everything I know? Good, I'm starved. Appetite's returning, hm? Don't tell me your boyfriend Gage finally came to the phone. Uh-uh, still holds out. No matter what name I give. If I tried for two weeks to get a man on the phone... ...and he wouldn't talk, I'd begin to suspect he didn't like me. - I guess I'm a diehard. - Ehh! Say, is that the best dinner gown you have? What? Listen, ducky, you're getting a bit particular, aren't you, - ...for a quiet family dinner? - But I like my women dressed. I wonder. Mr. Gage is downstairs, sir. - Gage? - Bring him right up. Bill... I'm going to give him a little case to handle. Oh, bartender, you're marvelous. - She's a beautiful thing. - I'm glad you like her, Mr. Gage. But I imagine she'd be pretty expensive to maintain. Yes, but I get a lot of fun out of them. - You're going to name her Ann III, eh? - Hm-hmm. Well, she looks like a winner to me. I'm counting on it to win the race Narragansett Race. Do you realize coffee's been waiting downstairs for one hour? - And so have I. - Sorry, Ann, I thought Granny was with you. You knew Gran had a bridge date at Rita's. I've just ordered fresh coffee, so if you boys will stop playing house. - Be with you in a minute. - On no, you don't! You two have been gabbing ever since we sat down at dinner. It's my turn. Come on, I'm sick of talking to myself. And this was Michael, the best dog I ever had. Swell-looking hound. Greatest hunting instinct I've ever known. - Still got him. - No. Run over. A year ago. - Gee, that was tough. - Sure was. I loved that mutt. Ann, have you read any good books lately? Yes, Gran, I read a swell book. About a girl who kills her father. Say, come over and see these, they're great. No thanks, I was brought up on them. Look here, I've just got to show you this. Are you interested in turkeys? We used to raise on our farm up in Maine when I was a kid. You did? That's a coincidence. - I raised them up at Holtstown. - Holtstown? Yes, a small town upstate. Only place where I'm a happy man. I've got a nice little farm up there. I'd like to show it to you sometime. I'd like to see it. This gobbler took first at the Agricultural Show. - That's an American Bronze, isn't it? - Right! Say, you know turkeys! I wish somebody would talk turkey to me. That's not right. Move over. Ah, surrender. After that run, it goes into an augmented fifth. Here, like this. Is there anything he doesn't know? Say, why don't you two get married? I guess I'd better be going. It's after two. No, don't go. You stay here. I'm off to bed. - Good night, smudge. - Don't hurry yourself. - Oh, I didn't realize that... Oh, shut up! Good night. Nice to have met you, Gage. Thanks. Don't forget we're lunching together tomorrow. - Right. Good night, Ann. - Good night. Stupid. Good luck. He's a grand person. I'm glad you like your future father-in-law. - You're starting that again, are you? - Hm-hmm. There's only one reason why you shouldn't marry me. That's if you don't love me. Tell me that, Tony, and I'll drop my shameless pursuit. All right, I love you. But there are a dozen good reasons why I won't marry you. Why, sir, you're not suggesting anything else. Oh, good heavens! You can't meet every situation in life with a wisecrack. I don't want to love you. Our marriage would mean nothing but unhappiness for both of us. - Go on. - Don't you see, Ann, I haven't a cent. Money means nothing to me. You'd have to adjust yourself to my way of living or you'd try to change me. Either way, one of us would break the other's spirit. I'm listening. Don't you know if I thought there was the slightest chance... ...to make you happy, I'd go for it? I'm mad about you. But I am not going to lose what little sanity I've got left. - Yes, Tony. - I've got a rotten temper. I'd forget that you're a spoiled baby and get angry. You live in a world of toys and I'd bust every one of them. - Don't you see, Ann? - Those things don't matter. Why, I hardly make enough to keep you in orchids. Then there'll be no more orchids. I love you, Tony. Not one cent, unless he comes to me himself! But Mr. Cedric, the situation is desperate. Humph! Of course it's desperate. He's caught, the fool! He never should have been president of any bank. I know how he's been bungling the whole job. Making loans on worthless collateral, and other idiocies. And he sends you to do the begging. He doesn't even know that I'm here. In fact, he was against approaching you. Oh, he was, eh? Too pig-headed to admit he's licked, eh? Well, until he does, Good day, Mr. Burkhardt. I should like to leave a statement of our assets in case you change your mind. Assets, what assets? You haven't got any! You people must have been out of your minds... ...to stand by and let him get the bank get in this condition. - It isn't worth a cent. - But the man is your own son-in-law. That's no asset to him either! Let him crawl for the money! Tell him that from me. Good day, Mr. Burkhardt. Oh, hello! Well, how do you do, Miss Ann? I hear you had a wonderful trip. Yes, perfectly. Grandfather all right? Oh, indeed yes. - He's holding his own remarkably. - Oh. Well, um... I'll be getting along. Your grandfather's expecting you, Miss Ann. - How are you, Holmes? - Oh, very well, thank you. - Hello, darling! - Ann, my dear! Oh, I'm glad to see you. Sit down here. You look marvelous. The Springs must have agreed with you. Oh, the Springs! I was anxious to get back to you. Now, tell me everything. Were you satisfied with all the... arrangements? They were grand, darling. But then, you've always spoiled me. Nothing's too good for my granddaughter. And the prince? Were you pleased with him? Oh, yes, the prince. He's charming. Grandfather... It'll be a royal match. On both sides, mind you. Grandfather, there's something I've got to tell you. Please don't be angry with me. But I can't marry Carlos. - Go on. - I know it's a great disappointment to you. But I've met someone I really love. Who is it? He's connected with your lawyers, Anthony Gage. A nobody. What does that matter, I love him. The arrangements for this marriage are made. It's utterly out of the question to alter my plans now. - What about my plans? - I won't permit it. Then I'll have to do without your permission. Oh, darling. I don't want to quarrel with you. You've always been so good to me. Ann, my dear. Ever since you were a child I've planned this future for you. It's been my life's ambition to see you where you belong. But Grandfather, I've never shared your mania for royalty. I've financed a revolution... ...to put Carlos on the throne. That doesn't mean a thing. All I want to do is be happy. I will not be disappointed twice. I arranged a regal match for your mother. And I let her get around me with her talk of happiness. And what did she do? - Married a fool, a failure. - Don't you say that about Bill. Now let's get this clear. If you marry that man, you won't get another cent of my money. That's what I came to tell you. I don't want any more of your money. And your father won't get any of it either. Bill? - What does he want your money for? - To keep him out of jail. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? As president of that bank he's responsible for every dollar deposited in it. His bungling has wrecked it and he has to answer for it. I don't believe it. Bill never did anything criminal in his life. Bunglers never do! Intentionally. Bill has plenty of friends. If he needs the money, he'll raise it somewhere. He can't raise a cent! The bank's condition doesn't warrant a loan. Everybody knows it's on the rocks. Burkhardt came to me just now begging for him and I'm the only one he can turn to. When shall I cable to the prince to come over for the wedding? Any time you like. - Who is it? - The laundry. - Ann! - Does Mr. Gage live here? Ann darling, come in. So this is your house. Well, of course it can't compare with the Holt marble halls. But you might as well see what you're letting yourself in for. It's charming. If I knew you were coming, I'd have baked a cake. I'd much rather have a kiss. - Tony... - What's the matter, dear? What's happened? You're all upset about something. I came to tell you... You came to tell me? I can't keep my date with you tonight. Whew! You had me scared for a minute. - I thought it was something serious. - I have to see my grandfather. Well, I suppose we can spare the old gent one evening. Considering we'll have all the rest of our lives together. - Cold? - No. No, I'm all right. Show me the rest of your house to me. My house? Our house, Mrs. Gage. On your left, madam, we have the bar. We've a bigger bar in my house. Well, you're just a poor little rich girl. On your right we have the library. Plenty of books for the long winter evenings. - Have you read any of them? - Oh, yes, I've read one of them. Let's see, where is that volume? Here it is. And this, this is the master bedroom. Of course it's the only one, but it's still the master bedroom. And here, we have a cedar-lined closet. And if you think you're going to use more than half of it, you're crazy. - So you're mean about closets. - Hm-hmm. Ahh... Oh, there's lost of things you'll have to get used to. I beat women who tidied their own drawers. I'm awfully good at mussing them up. The pipery. Heaven help anyone who disturbs my pipes. I suppose you knock them out on the rugs too. - Hm, good for them. - That's what Bill always says. - Anything else? - I'm a fiend about coffee. If it isn't strong, I throw things. Ann! Ann, darling, what is it? Oh, Tony. Hey, what's the matter, smudge? Got the jitters? Sorry. After all, Bill, four cups. That's right, criticize your old man. And I didn't make a single crack about the time you got in last night. Four o'clock. Is that decent? You shouldn't have been up. Oh, I heard you as I passed the study, up and down, up and down. What's the idea? Trying to wear a path in the rug? Can't a man think in his own house? You shouldn't worry, darling, really. Who said I was worrying? Bill, I am. About what? Myself. I want you to do something for me. Name it, honey. I want you to tell Tony I'm not going to marry him. What? - I'm going to marry Carlos. - But I don't understand, Ann. - What's happened? - Nothing. I was just thinking things over. I don't see how I can back up now. Back out? Well, what about Tony? What about backing out on him? It's all crazy. I shouldn't have tried to make things happen. It just won't work out. - So, if you'll tell him. - Well, I... Ann, honey, if you've had some silly fight... There's been no fight. I'm only trying to be sensible. Oh, I don't want to talk about it. - Good morning, Ann. - Hello. What's the matter with her? - Blast if I know. - Cedric temper, that's what. All right. - Come in, Tony! - Good morning. - Excuse me for barging in so early. - Not at all, have some coffee. No, thanks, I just did. Is Ann up? - Well, er... yes. - Visible? Well, she was. Er, have some coffee. Didn't you hear the man just refuse? Yes, she's up. Just flew out of here in a temper about something. - Temper? - Ask Bill. I hate mysteries. Anything wrong with Ann? I wish I knew. Maybe you can explain. - You saw her last night? - Yes, I did. Then why is she talking about marrying that dumb prince this morning? Your heard it wrong, Bill. She was talking about me. As a matter of fact, I just breezed in to ask you to name the day. My boy, I hope you're right. But that's not what she said. - She asked me to tell you. - She asked you to tell me? - If I were you, I'd ask her myself. - Yeah, I guess I'd better. Upstairs, first door to the right, first landing. Thanks. Well, she asked me to. Sit down! Lovers' quarrel, don't interfere. - Who is it? - It's me, Tony. May I come in? Ann, darling! Your father has some crazy idea that you... No, he hasn't. But... what's the matter with you? I've got to tell you I can't marry you. Say that again. I can't marry you. I've decided to marry Carlos. There's something funny about this. - What is it? - I tried to tell you last night. - That's why I went to your house. - And instead of telling me, you... So it was all a fake. - You don't love me. - Tony, I do! Then why this idiotic act? Why do you say these stupid things? I can't tell you. It concerns someone else. - Who? The prince? - Oh, no, Tony, no. I love you more than anything else in the world. - But I can't marry you. - I insist upon knowing why! You've got to believe I can't tell you. Well, then maybe I can tell you. The reason you agreed to your grandfather's plan in the first place... ...is because you wanted that kind of marriage. At first I believed you weren't capable of anything but phony emotions. I was right. I do love you. I'll admit you put on a great act last night. But that wasn't love. You don't know what it is. For your own sake, I hope you never find out. I know you'll be very happy. Goodbye. Now let me see. Would you kindly revolve, Miss Holt? - Would you kindly revolve? - He means turn around. Perfect! You will be the bride of the month. That's something to look forward to. Now, with this, I see a... Let me see. He's going into a trance now. I see a bouquet of white orchids. Yes, it could be. Suppose you take it off. His Royal Highness is downstairs and he mustn't be kept waiting. I've got a little model of my yacht upstairs if you'd like to see it. Oh, please, no. I do not like boats. I'm still feeling the sea from my trip. Oh, well that's too bad. Uh... how do you like America? - It's very large, no? - Yes, yes. But I asked you that one before, didn't I? - Do you like dogs? - Dogs? Yes, dogs, you know, whoof whoof. - Dogs. - Oh. I'm crazy about them myself. I've got a kennel up on my farm. - This is Michael. - Michael? Yes, a dog I used to own. Oh, yes, it is very good. I don't suppose you care for turkeys. I do not know. It is not a country I have visited. I think I'd better see if Ann is ready. Oh, please, yes. To a party, I do not like to be late. No, they might miss you. Hm, aren't you looking cheerful. I've been trying to get somewhere with that guy but he's got me down. I'm going crazy trying to figure out why she's marrying him. The whole thing's got me stumped. Don't let it lick you, son. Maybe you can get something out of her. You go talk to the prince awhile, will you? Not me, I'm going out to get drunk. But smudge, why should you marry that stuffed shirt? I told you. I think it's the sensible thing to do. But Ann, honey, it's not like you to be sensible. Thanks. Aw, honey, don't be cross with me. I've got miseries of my own. Oh, nothing that I can't handle. But it would be a lot easier if I could feel happy about you. You shouldn't worry, Bill honey. And if it's about money, why don't you go see Grandfather? Why should I go to see him? Well, he's in a terribly good mood these days. He's so delighted about the wedding and all. I still don't see what that has to do with me. For heaven's sake, will you stop fiddling that thing? Sorry. Ann. Ann. There's something definitely wrong with you. I want to know what it is. There's nothing wrong. - Oh, smudge. - No, darling, please, I'm in a hurry. He was a grand guy, that Tony. I'm sure he still is. - And your prince. - Please, Bill, let's drop the subject! I'm marrying Carlos because I want to. And I want you to stop worrying me. Be a good boy and go see Grandfather. - Yes, sir? - Double old-fashioned. - Very well, sir. - Make it two. - Yes, madam. - Why, Mrs. Holt! This is one of my joints also. Surprised to see me? And delighted. Do sit down. Don't have to ask me twice. - How have you been? - Splendid, thanks. You look miserable. Oh, don't get sore. I'm miserable too. So's Bill. We're all miserable. Sorry to hear that. Good. Just what I need. Bring me the bottle. Very well, madam. Well, sorry I can't stay in and get under the table with you. I'm going to a cocktail party at Rita's. Hm, Rita's... Sounds promising. - Hey? - I'll join you. We can get under the table there. Good! And may the royal nurseries flourish. Bravo, Dick! I now call on the groom-to-be to respond. Speech! Speech, come on! - Please, I do not know what to say. - You can't get away with that. Well, um... Must I? Go ahead, it's no worse than reviewing troups or christening battleships. We are very greatful to you for all your so good wishes. And for them we thank you very much. - Bravo! - Very nice, too. Now it's your turn, Ann. Oh no, Dick, let's relax now, come on. - Uh-uh, we'll have none of that. - We want Ann! - We want Ann! - We will now have a few words... ...from the chairman of the Elks Convention, our Miss Holt. - Oh! - So you won't talk, huh? - On the table! - Serge, no! Friends and fellow workers, the church bazaar will be held in the school auditorium next Sunday evening. And there will be a recitation by Mr. Buttington entitled... "Short sheets make the night seem longer." Which, my dear friends, reminds me of the happiest day of my life. And... Tony! So glad you got here. So am I, even if it is a surprise party for me. - Rita loves surprising people. - Yes, don't I, dear? - I want you to meet the prince. - I'd love to. Hm, Rita's always horning in on my men. Oh, please, can I get you anything? I'm all right now, really. I just felt dizzy for a moment. Oh, I understand. The excitement. - Yes, that was it. - Well, shall we go in and dance now? Just a moment longer, do you mind? - Oh, Ann. - Excuse me. You wait here for me. I'll never forgive you for this. But darling, don't be a dog in the manger. - You can't commit bigamy, you know. - You needn't have asked him here. But dear, I've been seeing a lot of him. I couldn't give a party without asking Tony. And I'm sure he doesn't mind. - Oh, Tony! - Yes? - They're out here, darling. - Darling, aren't we having fun? Prince Carlos, may I present Mr. Gage? - How do you do? - It is a pleasure. Tony felt that he must congratulate you. Thank you very much. I congratulated Ann the last time I saw her. I want to dance. I want to dance with the prince. - Who me? - Yes, with you. Come on, pick up your feet. Pardon me. Let's all go and dance. Come on, Tony. If I'm not mistaken, I have a dance to finish with Ann. Oh... pardon me. - Why can't you? - I have not learned it. You take him, Rita. He says he can't rumba. May I have the pleasure? If you insist. - This tune is familiar. - Yes, it's very popular. Charming fellow, isn't he? I mean, the prince. - Yes, he is. - Looks rather stupid. - But so do Russian wolfhounds. - I don't get the connection. Overbred. I suppose you're terribly excited at the prospect of becoming a princess. Yes, I am. I understand these royal weddings are very long and exhausting. You'd better wear comfortable old shoes. Thanks for the tip. I had an aunt who was presented at court. She said you must be sure and bring an air cushion. I'll make a note of it. I'll send you one as a wedding present. Thank you. It'll be nice too for the prince too when he discovers... ...that you already know the facts of life. So naturally she agreed. Do you think I'll let her make this crazy sacrifice for me? You want her to be happy, eh? You want her to marry this Gage. The day that happens will see your arrest and public disgrace. How happy will she be then? You can't do this to her! I won't let you! You want me to beg for the money. All right, I'll eat dirt if that will satisfy you. You won't have to. You'll have all the help you need, and more, as a present from me... ...the day she marries Prince Carlos. I'll get the money somewhere else! Oh no, you won't. I've seen to that. I'd like to... I'll lick you on this, Cedric, if it's the last thing I do. I wish we could, Bill, but it's impossible. - I understand. - Why don't you go to Cedric? You got us into this jam, Bill, and you've got to get us out! - What do you think I'm trying to do? - He's right! You've got to go to Cedric. I've pulled every wire, but the board can't do a thing. I'm sorry you had to come all the way to Washington to be turned down, Bill. You'd better go to Jerome Cedric. You've got to go to Cedric. What's the matter with you? Fly back tonight. And lay off this stuff or you'll crash. That might solve a lot of things. - What? - Ann could marry the man she wants, the bank's got me covered for enough to carry on, and she'd never know the mess I've made of things. Oh, don't talk drivel. You've got to see Cedric, that's the solution. I've got the solution. Why are you going back to Washington tonight? Business, honey. Then you won't be here for my wedding tomorrow. Oh, I'll be at your wedding alright. Bill, you're tight. How can you be in Washington and New York at the same time? Look at the things Houdini could do. Another thing. Why are we going up to the farm? - You can't fly from there. - Who says I can't? I had one of the boys fly my plane up. You can drive me over to the field later. I still can't understand why we came up here. Seems to me you might go places with your old man... ...on your last night of freedom without asking questions. After all these years and you're turning whimsy on me. That's it. Little Peter Pan, that's me. Remember the day you were swinging on the gate and fell and skinned your knee? Sure, and I yelled like the devil. And I gave you my watch to set you up? And I threw it at you and Gran spanked me? - And I balled out Gran? - And Gran won as usual. Oh, smudge. Bill, what's the matter with you? Can't a fellow get a little sentimental when he's saying goodbye to his old pal... ...for good? Bill! Well, it's your fault if you marry a prince and put the Atlantic between us. Come on. Bet you've forgotten the time I measured you. Oh, no. I stood right here on this bench. Where is it? - Here it is. - Wait, I've got my lighter. Looks like an epitaph. Bill, why don't you get another dog like Michael? No other dog could be like Michael. You can't go back and do things over, smudge. Not in this life. Now you're turning philosophical on me. - I'm finding out a lot about you tonight. - Are you, honey? Finding out that I'm not such a bad egg after all, eh? - Bill, there are lights in the house. - Yes. What is this? Well, it's a sort of wedding present for you. Picked out to please the prince and your grandfather. Especially your grandfather. I can hardly wait. Gran, so you're up here too! May I present Mr. Gage? - How are you? - Very well, thank you. Hello, Bill. Bill, what's this all about? Well, it won't take me a minute to tell you because I'm expecting Judge Tewilliger. Judge Tewilliger is the Holtstown justice of the peace. Once there was a dumb guy named Bill... ...who had a daughter named Ann, who thought the only way to save him from a terrible jam was to marry a dumb guy... Named Carlos. ...although she was in love with a swell guy named Tony. But the daughter named Ann was wrong about Bill, because he didn't need any help from the mean guy. Named Cedric. Because he got it somewhere else. - Bill, honest? - Honest. When I saw how that grandparent of yours had you buffaloed, I went down to Washington, and believe me, honey, I'm getting all the money I need. Oh, Bill darling, it's wonderful. - I've been so unhappy. - Everything's in shape now. Just the way I wanted. But I've got to fly back to Washington tonight to close the deal. So it seems to me the best thing for all dumb parties concerned... Let me finish. Ann... will you? Will I what? You know what. And that will be Judge Tewilliger. By virtue of the power conferred upon me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. What? Married? Yes, I wanted to be the first to congratulate you. Now you know what you can do with your prince. And you know what I can do with you! You will hear from me tomorrow. Well, er... it'll be a little difficult to get in touch with me... ...tomorrow. What are you up to? To victory, Mom! Nice to see you're your old self again, son. Gee, Mom, you've been swell to me. What else could I be? You don't think I'm a total washout, do you? You noodle, what's eating you? I guess playing the heavy father has got me down. You coming to the flying field with me? Playing the heavy grandma's got me down so, if you don't mind, I'll take my bones to bed. That's right. Sleep tight. Goodbye. - You mean good night. - Sure, that's what I mean. Good night. You be good to her, Tony, eh? Oh, I promise not to break her neck more then once a week. Goodbye, Billy boy, be good. I know you're going to be happy. And that's all that matters to me. Sweet. - Love me, baby? - What do you think? You're the best kid a man ever had. Goodbye. Hey, Cap, how's the new road from here? Well, pretty rough going at the beginning, miss, but after that it's clear sailing. Thanks. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
