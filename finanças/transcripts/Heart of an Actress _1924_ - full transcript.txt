But no-one knows, that an unknown poet gave you his soul and one of your looks is his universe. You're beauty, charm, and sorrow. You are Beatrice, Marguerite, Ophelia. in a breath of dream of ardent madness, the madman at your knees has only one heart for you "I would like to meet my unknown poet. I wonder what he looks like!" "Your poet, dear friend, has the sense to live in a nice place where we can go tomorrow by car, if you want it." "Please agree to accept this christmas present." "So, you too are on your knees for that sheep!" I ask you to excuse me, but tonight, we celebrate this party at home. Edith, the wife of Herbert Campbell. Madame Spencer, Edith's mother. "Here is what you get for having married a good for nothing writer. He spends all you got, but is unable to bring back a penny." The party at home. "Little one, stay only a great artist and don't play, like other women, with jewels and with hearts." The laurels of Tasse. "Oh, papa, what a pretty walk." To the marvellous talent of Helen Taylor, I dedicate this work. Herbert Campbell. "The broken glass, papa!" "It seems normal to me that Herbert goes with us to church." "The thought of a poet, isn't that a prayer?" "Monsieur Campbell, I was curious to know my poet." "You... You here!" "Milord, protect this play, the first that's dedicated to me!" "Bring your play to the theatre. I will bring it to the attention of the director." "I thought that poets wore long hair and glasses. He isn't bad at all." "Leave Herbert alone. He is free." "I won't allow you to receive theatre girls in my house!" "Because he is here, I will choose another abode." "And now to accomodate your pretty friends.." "Life is becoming impossible here, I can't support it much longer." "You want to get together with Miss Helen Taylor. I'm no fool!" "Come, console yourself. If he left home, on what money would he live?" He who had become a house guest... "You are exquisite, and others than myself will repeat that." Extase. ...and lord Stamford is always attended to... "He's lost his head and behaves like a boy." Jealousy. Lord Stamford has only just escaped from those jokes in bad taste, when... "I drink to your health, you old Adonis." "For my part, what a cheerful scene are you rehearsing..." "How those children make me hot..." "Don't waste your time reading that play by Campbell. I've changed my mind." When the guests have left. "The joys of art should have sufficed for you, petite... love... only tears!!" "I knew that you would come back." "My poor dear!" "Edith, we have to get divorced." "Remember!" He remembered... "Have pity on me, Edith!" "Could she have pity?" Since she no longer had his love... what good to fight? "I give you your freedom." First big disappointment. National Theatre. Dear sir, Please find enclosed the return of the manuscript of your play "Heart of an actress" that we are sadly unable to read at this moment. "I do not wish, dear friend, that the stock of refused manuscripts would become an extensive library!" "I await you in one hour!" "Go to lord Stamford in the soir?e, he will receive you." So much luxury dazzles Helen. "Souvenirs of the countries I have travelled... Do you like voyages?" "I would love them, but I have never left London." "The burning sand of the Egyptian landscape will captivate you." "That reminds me of the mysterious colours of the far east." "I beg you, read the play, it must be performed!" "What fire, miss Helen!" "I want you to listen from here to my meeting with your prot?g?." "Friends of Helen Taylor are friends of mine." "I've come to plead your protection against an injustice..." "It's the manuscript of the work I've already shown you. I possess no other." "I want to help you. For four thousand livres, will you cede to me your rights to your manuscript...?" "...that I will use as I see fit, even if it pleases me to see it go up in smoke... "Don't say destroy, say transform. Exchange the ideal for the reality and for the things that matter in life." "Listen to me. Let's talk seriously, as businessmen." "I love Miss Helen Taylor. Leave London and your play shall be performed." "Your play shall be performed. I swear it..." "When dividing the drama that you start rehearsing tomorrow, only give Miss Taylor the second role." Far away from compromise. "My future mother-in-law or my future sister-in-law. Herbert nevers talks to me about his family... "I'm the wife of Herbert Campbell." "I love my husband... But never doubt that I sacrifice myself for his happiness..." "Madam... forgive me, I didn't know..." "Here is the copy that I made of Herbert's work. He does not know if its existence. I forgive you my lost life if this play is performed." "There is a love that makes humble and that sacrifices itself..." "Who is sacrificed... Of your love and of mine, which one do you believe the strongest?" "Who can carry the heaviest burden..." I have just met your wife. I think that it's best never to see you again. I beg you, try to forget me like I will try to forget you. Helen. Overcoming her pain... always attentive at work, Helen... "The first role does not suit you. Evelyna will have it. You will take the second." "I refuse to play..." "What does it matter my dear! She thinks she is a star!" "Yet is isn't solely her talent who launched it..." "Well, I've put her in her place! She became unbearable!" "I ask you to come quickly. Miss Taylor is all in tears." "Go up to the office of Philipps, you will find Miss Helen Taylor in the arms of a worshipper." "I've come to reclaim my manuscript." "Father, go find Herbert's manuscript in my room." "This play which was dedicated to your pretty soul no longer has a right to be. You are not who I thought you was!" "You will see, milord! I don't need your money to destroy my work." "Forgive me. I would like to repair all this pain. I am your humble servant." Sacrificing herself, Helen perseveres in her ambiguous attitude. Fame in fiery letters is not identical to happiness.
