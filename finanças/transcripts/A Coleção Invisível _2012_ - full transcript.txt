- An eagle. - Why an eagle? You know why? Because eagles watch everything, from above. You already live in the clouds! Your turn Bruno, come on! Don't avoid the question. I want to come back the same. No, come on, you have to play. If you don't want to play, you're out! - OK. Well... I'd come back as... - Not as a sloth. It must be a different animal. Let me see... Ok. I know! I'd come back as a cow! An Indian cow. - Why is that? - A cow? The kind who spends his days walking around eating and shitting. And the crowd: "woooowww!" And you Beto? What about you? You asked, you have to answer. I think... I'd come back as a woman. - A woman? - That's a joke, right? Explain, explain... Women are always in pain! - Yeah, but they also cum harder. - Depends on the woman. - Depends more on the guy. - Exactly. But I'd come back as a woman that has I, the great Beto as her lover! Where to next? - The beach. - No, no... I know. Let's get a suite at the Libido Motel! No, motels are way too corny. Let's go eat something. - Beto! - What? - Come here, we gotta talk. - I'll be right back. - Wait, wait. - Just a minute, business. What is it? What about the money, Beto? - What? - The dough! You owe us two weeks. Right, it's because of the med school guy... - Orthodontist. - What? It was the dentist school's graduation. Whatever. The guy won't pay me, he says the sound sucked... - Beto! Let's go! - Hold on! Beto, eitheryou pay us, or the equipment stays here. Come by my place on Monday and we'll settle it, ok? - Wait right there! - No way. Monday! You have my word. Wait! Wait! See what you've done assholes? Screw you! Have fun with your equipment. Bring back my car right now! Right now! Ayrton Senna, my ass! I swear to god: If you scratch my car... Ok, wait for me. I'll meet you there. Oh sorry! - What the? - Wait. You can't stay here. Please, clear the area. Beto, answer the phone. Please. I know you're there. Talk to me... The funeral is at 4 at tomorrow. Come with me Beto. I can't do it alone! Beto, pick up... The city of Salvador is in a state of shock after the accident that killed five young people as we celebrated St. Lucy. Our reporter interviewed friends and families of the victims. Twenty-five reais. A cup. Good morning, Mr. Beto. Good morning, my son. Hi mom. Listen to me, you have nothing to feel guilty about. I'm going. You haven't been cool, Beto. You didn't call, you left me alone. I'm out, you get it? It's your party, your customer, so you figure it out! A kind of a circulartable with a long cloth. Beto, what a nice surprise! You came to give a hand at the antique shop? Yourfather would be pleased. My mother, a bit less though. Don't say that, my son. I came here because last week I received the visit of a curator from a museum in Germany. He's looking for paper artworks by Cicero Dias, the painterfrom Pernambuco. He's highly regarded in Europe. So I remembered that yourfather was a specialist in prints and drawings. That was when Dagoberto had the gallery next door. - A long time ago. - Not that long ago. Excuse me... Yes. What is it now? Ok, so you keep the sound mixer! Ok? We're all square? We could try to find a few works for this German guy and split the commission. How much is one of these worth? This size, of good quality, I believe over 100,000 reais. It's worth the effort, no? - Where are dad's archives? - In the back room there. - Here. - Find something? Cícero... Isn't that the guy Dimitri was talking about? That's him, Cícero Dias. The sale is from thirty years ago to a guy named Samir Loedy. Let me write it down. I didn't work here yet at the time. - What's the dude's name? - Samir Loedy. There are other sales on this page. Cícero Dias... Another here, probably a collector. - Where does he live? - Cícero Dias? No, Horacio, the collector, Samir something. Oh, right. Samir Loedy... Here, Samir Loedy, Itajuipe. - What's that? - Itajuipe. In the south, by the cocoa region. Now, this guy might be dead. - Good morning my son. - Good morning mom. Good morning Dona lolanda. - Do you have the 1974 log? - Mom, please! Is it me or have you not shaved today? Apparently that old nosy Dimitri found something interesting. You found something? Horacio. No, Horacio stays here. Attend the customer, Mom, please. I was first! You want one? Candy! Who wants candy? Fritter, fritter... How about one? All fresh... - What kind? - Meat. - I'm a vegetarian. - I have chicken too. What are you looking for? - Any hotels in this town? - Sure. - You show me where? - Let's go. Get out here little punk! - Yes? - How much for a room? Thirty reals, upfront. How many nights? Probably one night, only. Fill out the form. I'm looking for Mr. Samir Loedy. You know where I can find him? This guy here drives a cab. He knows the area. It's the old guy from the plantation Mundo Novo, behind the hill. Can you take me there tomorrow? They're not social people, but I'll drive you. I'll get the key. Pal, you don't have a better room? The presidential suite is booked... key. Hi, Mom. No, I'm fine... I wanted... My cell phone doesn't work here. I'll give you the number to the hotel. The Palace Hotel... No, not exactly a palace... I know we can't afford it. You have a pen? - Wesley. - Beto. I'm also a tour guide. - What is there to see around here? - Everything except beaches. Thanks. I heard you want to talk to the old Samir? I can introduce you to his daughter. I'm going straight to the plantation. He doesn't talk to anyone. You know what happened with him? No, what happened? Buy me a sandwich and I'll tell you. - Go ahead, order. - Give me a complete with cheese. - And a coke. - Right away. So there was a plague, called the Witch Plague. It attacked all the cocoa plantations. He got all crazy... - Hey! What kind of coke is this? - Regular coke. I want a diet coke. Everybody went nuts. He locked himself up in his farm and don't go out for nothing. - When was that? - I wasn't born yet. Can I come? - What about school? - We have the day off. In the middle of the week? Thanks for the offer but I have some serious stuff to deal with. What is this? A cellphone? An ipod, to listen to music. - Take care Elvis. - My name is Wesley, Wesley! This region took a hit, didn't it? The Witch, an epidemic, a fungus that ruined the farms and the people. You were a farmer too? Not in the least. I was a seminarist. You drank the church wine? I snuck out to meet girls. I'm lost. They cut the trees and you can't find your way anymore. Let's ask the old guy there. Excuse me, we're looking for the plantation Mundo Novo. You can go. You can go. - Mr. Samir's farm? - You can go, you can go. - No, we don't know the way... - Drive on, go! Great, thanks. Hello, I would like to see Mr. Samir. - Are you from São Paulo? - Excuse me? I have five sons in São Paulo. Do you know Marcílio who lives there? - No, I don't. - The meat is a misery nowadays. It was different in my days. We would go to the barn and get as much as we wanted. Good morning, I would like to speak to Mr. Samir. Beto... sorry. I am the son of Dagoberto Ferreira, art dealerfrom Salvador. Nice to meet you! Forgive me but I was not expecting you. I don't mean to botheryou. I only wish to speak with Mr. Samirfor a moment. My father sold him some prints. My father is Dagoberto Ferreira, art dealer as I said... Maybe you remember, from Ferreira Antiques, in Salvador. Many art dealers were chasing my husband in those days. But that was a long time ago. Unfortunately, Mr. Samir is resting. I understand. Do you think I could see a few pieces? I am preparing an exhibition in São Paulo and I traveled this far... I'm sorry but that is impossible. I see... I'm sorry to insist, but maybe could I come back later? Samir is a sick man. He doesn't receive visitors. And now, if you'll excuse me, I must go take care of him. Could I have a glass of water? All that dust on the way... Wait here. Thank you. Has yourfamily lived here long? This plantation belonged to my husband's grandfather. I wish you a safe trip home and good luck with your exhibition in São Paulo. Marieta! You take care of this plantation all by yourself? - Marieta! - Ma'am? Show this gentleman to the exit and make sure he doesn't get lost. Your mother called twice last night. - Can you pay your second night? - The shower doesn't work. - What's that? - The shower, there's no hot water. - Right, and the bill? - I'll take care of it tonight. Have some. Better than Viagra. Have some respect, buddy. - Hello Tavares. - Hello Saada. How is the crop? Better than last year. She doesn't know anything about cocoa. It's still not a reason to cut down the trees. I cut what I need to pay my employees! It's gonna mess everything up if you keep chopping down the trees. Saada, my love, always a pleasure. Shut up Juscelino, or I'll tell your wife. A caged lion still needs to eat. - How much are you paying? - 72 reais. - Chavez pays 74. - Foryou, 73. - Deal, 73. - Deal? How many bags? - Thirty. - Ok. 30 for 73 reais. - I get the money today? - Today, my love. See you later. You can unload. - Saada! - I'm busy today sweetie. I want to introduce you to a friend. And what is he doing out here in the middle of nowhere? He wants to meet yourfather. I went to the plantation yesterday. - My mom told me. - Great! So you know I'm preparing an exhibition in São Paulo. - And what did my mother say? - That it was not possible... So you went to snoop around the house behind her back. OK, I'm going, a customer is calling me. Ok go. A big hug! It was just curiosity. Afriend of mine, from Salvador, told me your dad has a very valuable collection of prints. How can I make it up you? Excuse me. Let's go get a drink. Just one beer. What else is there to do in a place like this? What are you thinking? You're gonna bang the daughter and then we'll give you the collection on a silver platter? I didn't say that. But you thought it so loud that I heard it. You want a piece of advice? Get out of here. Go your own way. Another building of Itajuípe will become an evangelist church. First it was the Iris Cinema, then Dona Valdete's Hotel, and now the headquarters of the Export Cocoa Office. Where are we heading? Soon in this town there will only be bars and evangelical churches. Bars we can do with, but temples... Itajuipe, let's be serious! An announcement: A pair of glasses was lost near Pacheco Square. If found, please leave them at the taxi station. And now, a musical intermission... Beto. I am a museum curator from São Paulo. I know who you are. You are chasing Samir, right? Exactly, and I thought a radio host... It won't be easy. His wife is a pain in the ass. She never saw money till she married him. When she became rich... - But I can introduce you to Samir. - Great, great. Samir is a good friend. During the golden years, we would take the 9am flight to Rio, get a shave at the Copacabana Palace, grab a beer at the Golden Beef and be back on the 7pm flight on the same day. I can arrange a meeting with Samir. But there will be expenses. I'm broke. You got ten reais? Can we meet him tomorrow? By car or by horse? - By car. - Sounds good. You got a smoke? - Thanks bro! - Tomorrow at nine! With deep sadness we inform our listeners of the death of Mr. Eurides Martins. The mass will take place at the chapel next to the main church. The coffin will then cross town for us to give our farewells to this dearfriend. Salvador? Next. - Destination? - Ilhéus. You know where Saada's plantation is? Yes. - Are you lost? - I would like to see Saada. She is busy, at the fermentation area. - She'll we back soon. - I'll wait. - Here is fine? - Sure. If you don't mind standing. Excuse me. - It's no good. - Not good? - It's too bitter. - Bitter? Bad fermentation. You agree? Yes, the after taste is a little bitter. But it is the flavor... No, we have to separate this batch. - OK. - Give me a hand? I see you don't give up easily. Ourfirst meeting didn't go too well, I thought we deserved a second chance. "We" deserve? "L" deserve. Better? Edvaldo, go to the barn, I'll meet you there. Are you looking for something? Yes. A good conversation starter. You don't look like the kind of guy who thinks much before speaking. I can always try. My exhibition offer doesn't appeal to you and your mother, right? Fine. However, I would like to meet my father's old friend. Is that all? And see some pieces of his collection. This collection is very valuable. You have no idea... Hundreds of prints and drawings. And yourfather has no interest in selling at least a few pieces? Perhaps in the future, who knows? But you made a terrible impression on my mother. Go back where you came from. There is nothing foryou here. Are you sure? You seem very lonely here. What do you see here? Any occupation for a city playboy? You're gonna put your hands in the blood of the soil, and dirty your pretty little outfit? Jesus... They called all afternoon. Speaking. I'm coming. Yes now. - Beto, my son, you came. - Hello mom. I was all alone. I called you. More bills came. Horacio wants to quit. He is asking for some money he says we owe him. But I went on that trip to resolve all this. Didn't I? Please find another excuse, Dona lolanda. Darling... Do you think yourfather loved me? Of course he did. What are you getting at now? I think he was too cowardly to leave me. You know? Many times I wished for his death. I prayed to see him suffer as much as I did. But when he died, I felt betrayed again. Mom, please... that's between the two of you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... How was your trip? Did you meet the collector? Yes, it's looking good. But those things are delicate. His wife doesn't want to talk to me and the daughter is the same. Son, life has taught me one thing: Everything works out in the end. Really? Then why did you do this stupidity? I forgot. You forgot? The incisions are superficial. She can leave tomorrow. Bring her back on Thursday to replace the bandages. You need to watch her. She's been doing this since I was a kid. She'll be quiet now. I found an old client of the gallery. Very good. You made his acquaintance? No, but I met his daughter. She told me about the collection... We're going to need money. - How so? - Like a deposit. The german guy, he cannot give us advance? But you haven't seen the collection yet. You need to make a listing, take some pictures. The German curator won't give money without seeing the pieces. These are my brothers. - What do you want? - Just to hang out with you. We brought fruit for snack. It's not possible kids. We'll drive you home ok? We are not driving anybody! Get out of here! Get out! Now! Leave the fruit, Romulo. What are you waiting for? Who is there? Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Samir. My name is Beto, the son of Dagoberto from Salvador. - Dagoberto? - Dagoberto Ferreira. From Ferreira Antiques. Dagoberto! My lord! It's been so long! How is he? - He passed away last year. - Really? I'm sorry to intrude in like this, but it was the only way. It's fine. My father spoke of you so often, I feel I know you a bit myself. And I thought I was just dead to the world. Never sir. My dad often spoke of your prints collection. He knew what he was talking about. Quite extraordinary, according to him. The beautiful, the rare, the unique. Do you also work in this field? I am a museum curator in São Paulo, with a special interest in prints. - Lies! - Excuse me? I spent my life saying I was a planter, but, in reality I am just a collector with a special interest in prints and drawings. Samir? This young man is Dagoberto's son. - I forgot your name. - Beto. How are you? I was talking about Dagoberto's visits. He was great conversation. Do you remember Clara? We would sit on this porch all night listening to Dagoberto's stories. He has left us, Clara. He is no longer of this world. - My condolences. - Thank you. It's unfortunate that you didn't call before. Clara, no one is going to disturb your daily routine. Can you have lunch for us tomorrow? - Tomorrow, we can't... - Tomorrow is perfect. - It will be a pleasure. - Wonderful. I talked to the old guy, Néemias. He invited me for lunch tomorrow. You made a good impression. He was a friend of my father. He knew your dad? He used to come this region a lot. - He took me with him a few times. - Serious? I was just a child. Once I told my mom something stupid, and he stopped bringing me. Who is that lunatic behind us? Isn't it Saada's truck? Why is she driving like that? Get out of the car! Let's talk! Shut up! Get in the truck. Come on! Driver's side. Saada, for God's sake. Stay still, Neemias. You saw nothing! Get in! Any funny business and you'll meet your ancestors. Calm down, I won't try anything. And I should trust you? I told you not to go to the farm. - Yourfather invited me. - Bullshit! He is a sick man. You went to trouble him with yourfucking charm talk. OK, I screwed up. But he was happy to see me. What do you know about my dad? You don't realize what you did. No, I don't! Tell me what I did. Ljust visited a friend of my dad. Friend? What kind of friend? Where was yourfather when there was no more money to buy prints? Who stayed with my dad when he turned blind? We became invisible. We could have died and no one would have noticed. - Saada, I'm... - Look at me in the eyes. Do I look like I want to mess around with you and your dad? Oh no! They're burning the forest again! I can't believe it. Drive, go ahead! With your mouth. You have to suck the fruit. You see these plantations. They were huge and full of people working. The field were endless. Then the Witch plague came and everything started to disappear. The farms became empty, silent. The furniture, everything left. The chandeliers, the china, the crystals. So, I would come here, under this tree. Things looked more solid here, more real. Have you seen the Witch? Look here. The Witch Broom. Why didn't your dad sell his collection? It's worth a fortune. He could have sold it. But there was no way he would. I was furious with my dad. I didn't understand how he could spend days looking at his collection and forget about us. My mother, it was like... she was being eaten alive by those vultures who came every day and took everything away. I thought it would kill her. Women don't die easily. My mom and I, we had to show courage patience, and abnegation, so my dad could keep his collection. Do I need to ask you again to leave? Are you ok? Never been better. You're no museum curator, are you? Damn! You look nothing like a curator. - I don't, do I? - No. When I was kid, my mom said I would be the King of Bahia one day. Now I'm... A worthless... a nothing. Don't say that. You are not nothing. You know what cocoa has taught me? The second harvest may be smaller, but the fruit is more beautiful, tastier. Here he comes. - My foulard? - Perfect. Good day Mr. Samir. Good day Dona Clara. - Am I early? - Just on time, my friend. We thought you wouldn't come. I knew he wouldn't leave Itajuipe without seeing my collection. I very much want to see it. I'm warning you, we won't just breeze through it. It's the fruit of fifty years of work. Do you have a favorite artist? Cícero Dias. He was your dad's favorite too. We, the collectors, we are even crazier than the artists. We are never satisfied. Never! Do you know the story of the child collector? I don't think so. - The man collected children! - Children? Legitimate and illegitimate children, from a first marriage, a second, adopted, bastards, found... One day he gives a dinner to bring them all together. One of his friends comments that one is missing. The collector says which one? The cynical friend answers: "The posthumous child". Then the collector impregnates his wife and commits suicide! Well, I'm not sure if it's that funny. But the art dealers are just as bad. Your dad was an ace. He learned to dance tango to convince an old Argentine woman to sell me a Di Cavalcanti. You remember Clara? Dagoberto dancing tango? More or less. Well, that's enough wasted time. Follow me, and see with your own eyes if yourfather lied about my collection. - Can I help you? - No need, take a seat. Excuse me. I must tell you that this collection is also Clara's work. Without her care and devotion for each piece, it wouldn't be what it is today. Well this folder is my favorite. See... What beauty! This one is a Bandeira. The pirogues of Ceara, his native land. Did you know that he started as a child, making postcards? You knew that? No... I've never heard about this detail. Now look at this couple drawn by Djanira. The tenderness with which she holds her lover's hand. The harmony of the tones. Impressive indeed. I got it in an auction, with this Segall. Sweetie, open the window so our guest can better appreciate the beauty. And now our Cícero Dias. What movement, what joy! Such an explosion of colors! Even the animals seem happy to live on this land. When I'm in a bad mood, I look at a Cícero Dias and I feel better. Go through the rest yourself. Dona Clara, this one smells of humidity. We need to give it some air and clean the drawer. - Clara! - Ok Samir! Give it to me, dad. Look at this seascape by Pancetti. A rarity! He preferred to paint with oil. It almost looks like a dream, no? He liked to write poems on the back of his works: "All days are night to see till I see thee. And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me." Dona Clara adjusted her hair, did she not? This gesture only belongs to her. Observe how precious this rendering of the lagoon is. If my memory serves me well, there is a poem on the back of this one too. Will you read it to me? Read it? Yes, read it. You want me to read it? Don't be shy, read it! You forgot your glasses? "Only what we lost is ours, when finally we become strangers to the alarm and terror of hope." My girl! I didn't realize you knew this one by heart. Thank you so much! You have given me great joy, son. There aren't a lot of people around here with whom I can share all this. You showed me some things... I had never seen before. My family has made great sacrifices to maintain this collection. But it was worth it. Have a safe trip, son. Mr. Beto? I won't forget you. Néemias is still shaking from yesterday. And you are not? I wasn't scared... just a little. Thank you Beto. My pleasure. - See you soon Néemias. - See you, Saada. To the bus station? Hello. - Are you Wesley's mother? - Yes, why? - Can I talk to him? - What did he do? Nothing, don't worry, I have something for him. Something? A gift. A gift? I'll call him. Daiane, go get your brother. Hurry up! You want to come in? Please excuse the mess. Children, you know... Some coffee or water? Please, don't bother. Make yourself at home. - Are you lost? - I came to say goodbye. - I'm leaving. - When? Today... Now. I know I didn't behave, and I am here to apologize. What? It's prohibited? It's weird. My brothers: Matheus, Romulo, André... and my sister Daiane. How are you? I know I'm an ugly duck, but I don't bite. - You want to tour the house? - I'd love to! Recovered by (c) dCd / June 2018
