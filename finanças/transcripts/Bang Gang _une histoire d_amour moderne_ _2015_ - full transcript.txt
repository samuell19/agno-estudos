One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. C.G. Jung | A modern love story | Two months earlier. It was the year no one could forget. The year of the endless winter and the heatwave, the year all those trains derailed. the year of the Bang Gangs. That week. the sun finally came out and it all began for us. France was in a period of mobilization. It was all sectors of society, not just military, Also scientific. As with WW2, when the USA invented the atomic bomb. C'mon, come get me, don't be an asshole. After, then. It's too far, c'mon! I can't come otherwise. I gotta go. - What're you doing? - What about you? Guess. Dunno. See you in class tomorrow. No, come here, I've got an idea. That asshole leaves them all alone. They're happy here. They'll be happier with us. Let's go. Got him? Grab him. He's gonna poop all over me! That one's taking off! Where'd he go? There. Come here. I need to go. Come here! Hey... Want me to drive you somewhere tonight? That'd be cool. You weren't supposed to be here. But I am. I was away, I came back. That's how it is now. I come and I go. Stop it. Plead your case. I can't have a social life at my age? You say I'm a loner. Want me to be a nun? Would you like that? Be home by 11. If you're late, I'll circumcise you. You're scary sometimes. Thanks. Can I have a swig? Thanks. Let's show them. C'mon! Come on, fuckers! I'm in! Xabi's always happy! 2 in the morning! I trust you and this is what you do? Exploding tank cars literally blew the building skyward. Many still await word from loved ones who live near the tracks where the train derailed. 30 houses were destroyed in the explosions following the derailment of 4 cars. 100 firefighters are struggling to access the area, where the smoke is thick. Fortunately, rain may help the firefighters, who have been joined by American firemen. We still don't know why the train derailed in this dense zone... Butter, please. Jam? Sure. - Hey, bums. - Any bum worth his salt can do this! Can you? How was P.E.? - I like sporty girls. - Tough luck. I hate to run and I've got no endurance. George, I bet you're a real athlete. Gotcha. Wanna chill at my place later? I can't, my dad'll kill me. I'm grounded. He doesn't know your afternoon schedule. Afternoons, anything goes. It's a trust thing. Gimme a break! Have some of this instead. - Meet you here in an hour? - Righty-ho, old sailor! Don't capsize! Look what I brought. Let's see. Ladies, meet a close friend of ours, Sasha Grey. Just met her. Bit of a nympho, but nice. I get hard just hearing her moan. I see that. We can't see. Maybe it's too small. It's not fair, guys can tell if a girl has big boobs, we can't see. All you have to do is ask! He loves it. Don't look! Such a feeling of freedom! - You lost your boner. - Can't have it all. - He's always doing that. - Going limp? As General de Gaulle said, "Hail the cold winter sun, put the weenie in the bun!" Get up, gimme a 360°. Ok, just for you. No helicopter, please. See? Go on, laugh. You're alone here? My mom's in Morocco for 9 months. She left you here all alone? What, are you a spy? No, just wondering. It's weird. Feels more like a country house It used to be. Mom and I moved here when my parents split. She was broke. Where's your dad? We don't get along. I'd rather be here. I see him weekends, when I have to. I'm thirsty, got any juice? Sure, there's olive oil in the fridge. Shut up. The air's dry, I need a drink too. What a dog! Laetitia's so ugly. What a lame thing to say. You're such an ass. She's so not ugly. She has a scooter and she's up for anything. Even on her scooter she's butt ugly. So what? You're hot. She's ugly. You're sexy. Anyone ever told you you're sexy? Wanna smoke? Wanna warm me up a little? C'mon. I'm cold. Come here. Give me your hand. Wanna go inside? Let's go. I think I'm gonna go. It's raining and all... Whenever you want. Need to blow off some steam. Always welcome, Gen 16. Session in progress now. Perfect. Dad? Hi, honey! - How's it going? - Good. Who's my favorite little brother? What time will Mom be home? Around 8 or 9 I think. Want me to make dinner? That'd be cool, yeah. Wanna make dinner? Let's go. It's ok, sweetie. Look at the little mouse. We're almost done. Attack! You're lookin' for trouble, pal! Wait, wait... 2 seconds. Phone. - It's nothing. - Time to go. Check you out! What is it? My hamster. My father wants me to get rid of her. - Yeah, she's ugly. - Want her? Want her, Alex? I don't have room. You'll finally have a female in your palace. Want me to take her? Yeah, take her. Maybe my parents will let me take her. She's so cute. - Where'd you get her? - George. Who wants to translate? Anyone? George? From so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain fried up... dried up, causing him to lose his mind. Good. Cervantes tells us he lost his mind. What exactly does that mean? He's crazy? He is crazy, right. Don Quixote has lost contact with what is real. With reality. But in Cervantes' book, Don Quixote, there is another very important character. What's his name? Sancho. His name is Sancho Panza, that's right. He's a common man, fat, ridiculous, on his donkey... But Sancho Panza is just as crazy as Don Quixote. A recently licensed train conductor, he'd been working for a year. His body was found severely mutilated... - I'm going out for a bit. - Where? Don't worry, I'll be back for dinner. I'll put him in the playpen. Yo, whassup? Your dad had to leave again? Where is he this week? Cassis, I think. He's furious. He left today, he'll be back Friday. You're lucky, your parents let you go out anytime. Did he call you back? What do you think? Are you close to Gabriel? Not really. We played a lot when we were little. His dad had an accident 6 months ago, he's been withdrawn. Didn't know you were neighbors. He checked me out. Really? Should we go see him? Gabriel's totally boring, there's nothing to see. Believe me. C'mon, aren't you curious? Sure, I'm totally curious! Gabriel! Gabriel! Hey, Gab. Hey. What're you doing? Stuff. Yeah? Like what? What do you mean? What're you doing? Music. Really? See, that's interesting. I didn't know. Can we come in and listen? How's it going? Hello, ma'am. I'm still working on a few things. So? I'm not finished yet. Hang on. Let me see something then. See, it works. Gabriel, please turn your music down. That's it. I'm really impressed. I didn't know you had it in you. It's awesome. I wouldn't go that far. You don't know what it's like. My dad seems cool but he plays Für Elise on the guitar! At least it's Beethoven, not Coldplay or something. I think you're a genius. Can you send it to me when it's done? You want it? Yeah, sure. Who's he? Not bad, huh? - Does he go to school here? - Not anymore. He works in Bayonne. Hey. See you in Spanish class. What time you out? 4 pm. Me too. Head home together? Wanna come over for some juice? I can't, I promised my mom I'd help her. They have to do the mezzanine and bathroom at the same time. Sleek, graceful, feline... Here on the mat in Madrid, Alina Kabaeva for her ball routine. George 7 Missed Calls - How're you? - Good, you? I'm OK. Sorry, my phone's been acting weird. I was surprised you didn't answer my texts and calls. - You went a little overboard. - I was worried. About what? Thought I got kidnapped by a bear? Thought you were avoiding me. Why'd you think that? Dunno. Wanna go see a movie tonight? No, I don't feel like going out. Besides, there's this chick playing with a ball on If you don't wanna see me, say so. It's not that. Wanna sleep over tonight? It's tricky for me to get there. Yeah, shit. Could you come get me? I'd love to, but Nikita messed up my tire. Shit. I 'll skate over. Never mind the dark. I 'll just wait until my parents go to bed. Cool. Be careful in the dark. You don't know me, I'm an Amazon. Cool. See you later. Later. Hey, Niki. Can you come over? Know what you could do? Stay here for a few days. Seriously? Yeah. Hands off, asswipe! We're gonna set this place on fire! Hi! It was open. - You burst one of my balls! - Sorry. That was quick. Niki's moving in. His place is a mess. Nice of you. He sleeps with his brothers. Might as well stretch out here. And the hamster? Laeti said her dad was gonna zap it in the microwave. Want the bong? Hi, Mom? Good, you? How many girls have you slept with? What? How many girls have you slept with? I don't know. So many you've lost count? Yeah. Like at least 15? Yeah, at least. Mine's not great. I'm not good with my hands. Nah, it's nice. - The flowers are too far apart. - Add some. Yours is beautiful. You should make one for Alex's on Saturday. There's a party. Don't you guys talk? You dumped him? You dumped him! Poor guy, you didn't even give him a week. I think he's totally gorgeous. Don't get too excited, he thinks you're ugly. I told him he was a stupid asshole. He and Nikita are so in the closet. Bet they blow each other off watching gymnastics. Losers. Hey, Laeti. I'm cold. Got a sweater I could wear? Yeah, in my room. Cool. Hang on. It's a mess, I'll help you. Try this one. Yeah, cool. Thanks, perfect. Hang on... You like cotton? It makes me itch. I'm not ugly all of a sudden? What're you talking about? Would I be hard if you were ugly? Your eyes are so beautiful. Your mouth is so beautiful. You remind me of an actress from the 80s, I forget her name. Oh yeah? Feels like a rotten thing to do to George. You think too much. She's got all the guys at her feet. You get me so hard. I wanna put my dick in your pussy. I bet your pussy is real soft. Alex... I'm a virgin - No you're not. - Yes I am! I'm flattered. Feel how flattered I am? What're you doing here? Laeti said you were having a party. I figured we could talk. I don't know. Did I say or do something wrong? I don't get it, seriously. You said you weren't avoiding me but you are? You're the one who asked me to sleep over. I know, but... You seemed sad. What? I didn't want you to be sad. I don't have the energy to deal with you now. And I don't feel like it. You should go. Got a condom? - A what? - Condom. No, sorry. Hey, cupcake! What's wrong? Bad day? I got what you need. It's... the best medicine in the whole world. Just one for now. Then you'll tell me. That's right. Thanks. What do you mean, you couldn't find a condom? Nobody had one. Don't worry, we're not a high-risk population. - Cute, right? - Cat videos suck. Enough kid stuff. - C'mon, they're cute... - They'll put us to sleep! You wanna radically change the vibe? - Yep. - Good call. I'm into blond Californian bimbos, check her out. - She makes me feel better. - I hear you. Let's watch it big. - Cool, right? - Great, thanks. Seriously. Better, right? Wanna play a game? - What game? - You'll see. Up for a game, losers? It's not for pussies. It's like truth or dare with only dares. Just like that. UP for it? - No shit. - Are you sure? - For real? - We're not in kindergarten. True. - Are you joking? - Let's do it. A little bit of contact... Between friends. I get all the contact I need. There's no such thing as too much. C'mon Giulia! Don't let me stop you. C'mon, it's just a game. Strip off and play along. Check out her sexy shorts! Her tight little butt... Giulia! Your loss, Giulia. Bye. Your loss. Too bad. - Where's Laetitia? - Upstairs with Alex. Take it further! More like that! This game is amazing. Who taught you? I taught myself, dummy! We should name it. It's like a big bang... All this magic exploding... A banging gang... The Bang Gang! Awesome... I always wanted my first time to be special. That was special. And you've got the video. I mean a first time like no one's ever had. Sorry to disappoint, but no matter what, first times are always pretty basic. Unless we do something with the video. What? Screen it at school? Careful, you'll have a fan club. No, shut up. A secret thing people could see. Maybe I'm weird. Anonymous though, I don't wanna be the new Paris Hilton. Or with a fake name. Don't worry, Laetitia Martin doesn't sell dreams like Paris Hilton. Asshole. - How's it goin? - Good, you? Good. - What happened? - The hamster went wild. Are you fucking kidding me? I never thought you'd betray me like this. You told me you didn't give a shit. You gonna move in to my house next? You should've been straight with me. Don't be a drama queen. Shut the fuck up, you cunt! - What if someone from school sees? - Your big dick? Seriously, what if they do? You're so computer illiterate. I'll explain. You set up a password. People can't access it without. Only people looking for porn will find this site anyway. You think they'd tell on us? Dunno, it's fucked up. We could charge people for access. We'll be billionaires. Like those Facebook guys. Wow, you're really onto something. We'll be multi-billionaires! You're a giga genius! You're a giga zero! Porn is free! Get rich quick, with porn? Your start-up is 40 years behind! Think you're Mark Zunenberg or whoever? You took more drugs than him. We could create a Playtime account and a hashtag bang gang so everyone can post pics. It wouldn't be just us, two pervs jacking off at our screens. We're all in it together! So you're taking an ethical approach. Sweet. Playtime it is. They're old enough to post their own pictures. Let me handle it. In the worst train accident in France for 25 years. early reports confirm 6 dead and dozens wounded, 9 in critical condition. For more, we go to our correspondent Richard Place. 6 wagons derailed. One of them is lying across the rails. Witnesses and survivors say the impact was spectacular. The train literally split in two. To rescue the 370 passengers, a red emergency plan has been put in place. 300 firefighters are on the scene... Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, Laetitia. This one's cool. Lots of likes. Hey, guys- Hey, Niki. - How's it goin? - Good, you? So... Gaïa wants to know, gonna do another Bang Gang? What's going on, Xabi? Show your weenie once and you're king of the landing strip? Maybe I'll do one next week. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. - You can come. - Cool, thanks. Come on, Gabriel. Don't knock. - You can carry him yourself. - It's quicker if you help. Will you help me? We need to get back to normal. That's right, tell yourself we can get back to normal. If you have any constructive ideas, let me know. There. I'll do it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Thanks. Thinking what I'm thinking? Big time! Bang Gang at the house, kids? Now or never You know I like you. Are you retarded? A facial? Seriously? Girls get paid for that! Hello, Mom? How are you? It's great to hear your voice. Of course I miss you. Niki's here all the time. Lots of friends drop by, I'm not lonely. It's totally cool. Morn, can you hear me? Wanna come over? It's a bit tough right now, Laetitia. No need to be rude. I didn't say no. Why don't you come to the Bang Gangs? I'm not sure I... - What? - Nothing. - What? Are you gay? No, I'm not gay. What difference would it make? Then what's the problem? I'm not into groups. It's not my thing. I know what you mean. I'm not into groups either, but I don't know... It makes you feel really alive. Really free. Next time Alex does one we could go together. Don't you go with George? She'll be there, but we're not talking. She's being a drama queen. Too bad, you were close. Be right there. My mom needs me. Thanks. Well, if your mom needs you... Real classy. When will you stop butchering that song? Do I hassle you about what you do? Wanna come to Alex's now? It's fucked up we're not talking. Alex is doing a Bang Gang. See you there? I miss you. It's now or never. George! Sorry about Alex, I really didn't get it. You won't talk to me? This is how you react? I come in peace and this is how you react? Fuck. Fuck, your stuff is total shit. It's not coming up. I can't help that. Such a shame. I really wanna feel good. Give it time. I'll make you feel good... You'll make me feel good... We'll make each other feel good again. Feel good forever... We could make everyone else feel good too. Yeah, I like that. You're a nuclear reactor radiating joyful energy inside. You wanna turn everybody into sunshine. Warmth! Joy! Warmth and joy... C'mon guys, let's go! We'll all make each other feel good. - We all have super powers, y'know? - Super powers? I'm gonna radiate joy on you. You'll feel the warmth all over. Warmth and joy... I radiate joy one at a time, go away. I'm next. Hot, isn't it? Yeah. What're you doing here? What were you doing in that house? Close your eyes. Close your eyes, I know what you need. Gabriel, let yourself go, just once. - Thanks for walking me home. - Don't mention it. What were you doing in that house? - Some Beatstyle. - What? - Some Beatstyle. - What's that? Who cares? You're very beautiful. Thanks. - Look at this. - What? - I'll expand it. - What's that? - It's not me. - YouTube? Fuck. Look, Niki. - What the fuck? - Some asshole put George on YouTube. It's not me. - Is that you? He just keeps denying it. Crazy. - Are there others? - Don't be so worried. I don't think so. There was so much filming going on. Wasn't meant for YouTube. Maybe not, but it's on there. - Not cool. - Nasty. - Why'd you do that? - Seriously? I'll throw coins at you, bitch! Hey. - What are you doing here? - You weren't answering your phone. There's videos and photos online. Doesn't it bother you? What do you want me to do? I'm not gonna go to the police. It's no worse than the pics everyone's posting. There's a difference between idiots having sex and a girl getting railed by a bunch of dudes. You don't get it? It'll be online for life. You'll always be Miss Warmth & Joy who was so high... I'll find out who posted. Maybe they'll take them down. If they don't, it's a disaster. You smell good. Think it'll be all right? I don't know. Can you feel it? What? Can't you feel it? The energy flowing between us? You're so crazy. Yeah, I feel it. Is it me, or did something special happen between us? I can't stop thinking about it. I hope I didn't ruin everything. Yeah, take the page down. It's a miracle they didn't find out. They're slow, but still. You should go home too. Take that stinky hamster with you. Alex? You there? You put George on YouTube? It wasn't you? You posted a video on YouTube. Do you realize? Want the whole school to call her a slut? Take it down tonight! If it's still online when I get home, I'll fuck you up tomorrow! I'll fuck you up good! warmth joy George THANKS Here's the molecular structure for chlormethine. A nitrogen molecule surrounded by carbon and chlorine, hence the name. - What's your problem? - Warmth and joy, right? Seriously? Shut the fuck up. Dipshit! I'm a bit concerned about this lesion here. It looks like a chancre sore. What's that? A symptom of syphilis, a sexually-transmitted disease. It's fairly rare now, but it does occur. Have you had unprotected sex? You don't know how many partners you've had? Dunno, with the Bang Gang... dunno. Can't remember. What do you mean by bang gang? These parties we have, no big deal. What do you do at these parties? May I have one? Sure. Thank you. One misfortune always seems to follow another. Yet another train derailed yesterday... I'll put him on. Speaking. Excuse me? Ok, he'll be there. Thank you. Could you help me please? The hospital's testing your whole school for syphilis. Your appointment is Friday. If you have anything to say I want to hear it from you, not a doctor. What? I didn't understand. If you have anything to say I want to hear it from you, not a doctor. What're you talking about? - What's going on? - No idea. ...events concerning E that aren't A. Therefore, each outcome in part A realizes event A. So what is an elementary event? An elementary event... is the part of E that contains only one outcome. You can die from it. Or go insane. Apparently lots of 19th century writers died from it. Look... Baudelaire, Nietzsche, Van Gogh. You really think people die from it now? Even AIDS doesn't kill people anymore. Relax and put the phone away. Worst case, no more orgasms for you. How old are you, Gabriel? Sixteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Almost eighteen. How many partners have you had? One. Just one. Zero. I'm a virgin. Three or four. More or less. You've got gonorrhea. The treatment is taken in a single dose. You'll get well quickly. The good news is you tested negative for syphilis. Some of your friends weren't so lucky. The orgies in themselves aren't so shocking. You're fucking, so what? But it's so profoundly mediocre. Is that any way to relate to one another? You're all interchangeable? Guys are dildos and girls are vessels? That's what you call freedom? Some kids fight for revolution. You fight to fuck anything that moves? Don't you have anything better to do? - Enough! - What're you doing? You're going to boarding school. I've had it! Hands off! - You leave Monday. - The school year's over! You're sick, I want you gone! - You're the sick one! - Give me your phone. Go ahead! - You're sick. - You make me sick! What the fuck are you doing? With the syphilis and the Bang Gangs, everything we'd found so natural turned into an epic school scandal. Then the heatwave came. and our scandal was yesterday's news. It was time for me to move on. What? You've got that mischievous look. I'm happy to be here. I met up with my mother in Morocco before summer vacation. She'd heard about what happened, of course, but never said a word. George... I kept imagining ways I could've treated her better. I never saw Alex, Gabriel or George again. That whole part of my life is like a faraway interlude, so extreme, so intense, so brutal, even, that I sometimes wonder if it was real. A shot of penicillin, and bam, no more syphilis. A pill, and barn, no more baby. A modern fairytale. Let's go, Laetitia. I was afraid I'd be sad after the abortion, but no. The hormones disappeared. and the fog and fatigue instantly lifted. Suddenly I had my body and my freedom back. All summer long, we heard about old people dying and more trains derailing. It all felt appropriately apocalyptic. No more bad reputation. no more Miss Warmth & Joy. Just the future that was ours, again. I feel like I experienced firsthand the implosion of an unstable system, far bigger than the sum of ourselves.
