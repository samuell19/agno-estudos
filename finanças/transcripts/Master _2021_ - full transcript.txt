'Wake up, sir' Don't switch off your phone Talk to him - Poor husband - 1 minute, sir They are objecting to elections Support us, sir - Sorry, sir - Get out - Useless fellow! - Thank you, sir JD, what is your opinion about conducting elections? Election is essential, that's all - I thought as much - 'He will say something meaningless, sir' If we announce a students' election all of them will be thinking of only that Not one of them will study nor will anyone attend any class Correct, what will they learn by conducting students' election? Why encourage politics in college? Matthew sir What is 'politics', sir? Sir, I don't wish to talk to you Is that so? But I wish to speak I'm coming Sir First a student should know 'politics' means service Only if our students learn about election, canvassing, leadership in college ...they will have an awareness about state, central elections for the future College students are our first time voters Only if (s)he is allowed to think A new leader will emerge for the next generation To mould as a good leader or to choose the right leader ...they will acquire both tact and discretion For someone to- They will stick posters all over and spoil the walls with graffiti Then claim ownership over the walls and fight Doesn't all this happen in normal elections? Sit down, sir Aren't these normal issues that crop up in general elections? So can we decide to abolish elections in our country? We have grown up with this culture of poster, banner, fanfare, still follow it If students should know the do's and don'ts of poster etc ...we must conduct elections in college Only then he will be a good example outside 'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani' booze and big bucks should change' ...students should know the ins and outs of politics Okay Let's assume what you're saying is right Who is responsible if students resort to violence or damage college property? Sir, nothing of that sort will happen If you are proved wrong will you leave this college? Will you resign, huh? We'll see if it happens Then you be the presiding officer And conduct this election If any problem crops up Sign an affidavit you will leave this college Coming June 25th Students' elections [loud cheering] I haven't seen him conduct an election as a master 'But I've seen him do the same as a student' Pccht! Shake your hands This is the wall of democracy Your rules & regulations 'Gym facilities free for all students' 'Meat will be served for all in the hostel' 'Good orators have become able leaders' You should speak up more boldly, Savi 'Instead of finding faults with your rival and campaigning' '...ask for votes listing your reforms' Tear every single poster, dude Posters and banners should be stuck or erected in their allocated places 'Even if there's a small brawl among the students' '...election will be canceled' You pull back and fire Cheers!

True that? 'Tomorrow if you have a problem and you come to me' 'Even if it's midnight I'll be there for you' Why should we create problems and end up in the police station? Beverages free in the canteen Aqua training access free You will have campus interviews You'll leave the college with a job in hand Above all give this serious thought Do you want to be ruled by a girl? Or revel in a boy's leadership? Hey! That isn't even my glass Some other chap has relished a drink and gone, madcap! How dare you! 'JD' please 'The third round of votes have been counted...'

Sir Carbon copy, sir Oh! Come on, JD Haven't you opted for a break of 3 months, intending to teach? Teach? In which college? College? As you have mentioned Observation Home Sir, don't play the fool What will I do there? I didn't sign this Maybe after 6:00 p.m? After 6:00 p.m Good chance See JD, you're losing control on yourself If there's any issue in the election didn't you agree to resign your job? That means you have something on your mind Fine, sir, I'll go Well...I have many 'well' wishers here This must be their handiwork It's okay, I need a change too, I'll go 'Inspector is waiting in your lodge to explain the job you'll be undertaking' 'That means' - Needhimani - Bro? You didn't pass on any information? No, bro Then whatever lawyer sir and I spoke in the union office - How did the police get to hear? - That's what puzzles me, bro You know this music director Anirudh? He has composed a new film song Shall we listen? - Listen - 'Bro' 'Bhavani has fixed the date You are his next target' 'He has decided to kill you too by framing it on those boys' What do you say, bigamist? At least is this your voice or will you claim its mimicry? - Bro - Did you call me, Bhavani? Make sure the boys are supplied their regular dose of drinks and drugs Whether they get 3 square meals a day or not Booze and dope should flow steadily Okay, Bhavani I'll see to it Where was I? You got me married and how can you make my wife a widow? - Tell me, bro - Wait I'm choking with emotion hearing your sentimental speech Why are you jerking? I had tucked the knife in my waist What if it pierces me in the wrong place? - Not that - Suppose an enemy kills us Doesn't matter if they say 'that's how Bhavani died a noble death' If they say, 'he had tucked a knife that stabbed him in a wrong spot' Does that sound good? - No - No, right? Won't sound good - Lean back comfortably - Don't, bro - Is that a show of respect? - Yes, bro How is it over the phone all this 'bro' kinship is missing?

Dispose this body and ask someone to drive this truck Okay, bro "Creep like a lioness, make no sound" "Slide like a snake, over sun baked ground" [song 'Rise Up'] Sir, can we switch off that cacophony! Then shall I wear my coolers?! "Twist like a hurricane, bend and sway" "Break like a wave, wash the filth away" Sir, college students are bound by certain protocols of parents and society But those boys there lack all that discipline Their age and their activities have no connection whatsoever 'Not even a single inmate is human or humane' 'Beasts' 'Demons' 'Kabaddi' 'They know our law is lenient to their habitual crimes' 'They use it to their advantage breaking laws as reckless criminals' 'That's why, I'm telling you, sir' Don't bend backwards to reform them in those 3 months you are assigned there Aren't you wondering whether to go there or not? 'Sir...?' 'Sir...!' 'Is our hero in dream world?' Sir, check if that's your phone? Bro...bro 'Wake up, bro' Not mine Oh!

"If I'm doin' somethin" "Boy...I like to do it well" "And when I'm in the zone" "Ain't nobody stoppin' me" "You know who it is" Das, look at his stride and beard! Doesn't look like a master Doesn't carry a book or a cane He looks so local Rough & tough We'll provoke him and then pounce "Master" "They call me...master" "You know me...master" "I'm master the blaster" "Master" "They call me...master" "You know me...master" "I'm master the blaster" "If you step foot in our place it is trespassing into our space" "We will hassle you to the root Master, change your route" "As juveniles we roam in this Observation Home" "Tears in our eyes ready if you ask us to study" "Don't take lessons in life Or ask us to drop our knife" "Your lame advice is of no use We don't want your views" "Sir, don't take lessons in life-" Why did you stop singing?

We thought of chasing you away if you started lessons today You are unique, master He seems to be one of us Turned out I'm quite jobless Why waste time sitting? Why is this place so dirty and stinking to high heaven? We celebrate 10 festivals a year and 20 birthdays of leaders You don't clean up this place and celebrate on any occasion? 'Celebrate' means?

I can drop you in my car That's alright I can manag- I was hoping at least you will bring about a change Why? It's all going smooth The boys are having fun We are submerged in problems Half the boys are drowning in a sea of drugs Whatever they get they readily use as weapons Everyday some boy or the other twists his arm or ankle Why tell me all these tales? Am I the police or what? I'm just a teacher here Sir, you don't understand The police will nab the criminals Court will punish them To guide these boys To sift and sieve right from wrong We are not equipped, sir They need a master like you First understand this is a reformatory for juvenile delinquents 'The boys have got into a fist-fight, sir' 'I am unable to control them Whoever is out there, come in, sir' Yov! Wait, man I am coming in now First close A block and ensure outsiders don't enter He isn't picking the phone, da 'What happened, bro?' 'I tried 10-15 times He isn't picking my call' 'Try again, bro' 'He isn't picking our call' 'Do you remember sister Charu's number?' 'Call her, bro' 'Hurry up' Manikandan speaking, sister You saw me in the Observation Home Someone is coming - Switch off the phone - 'Hello...hello?' 'Can you hear me, Mani?' Go, brother Enjoy the 'biriyani' 'Brother...?' - We don't want - Why? Not hungry Is that so? He asked you to eat, right? Half baked nutcase! How much we have suffered, starving in this same spot, moron Get me some water Bro, I'm scared- Lucky to get a leg piece in a 'biriyani' You can even kill someone But not rob him of food Go on, eat Water Enough They took my phone though they knew very well it was mine Whom did you call? No one, bro Don't know Tell me the truth I don't know, bro Ma...master, bro Who? The master who joined duty - Master, huh? - He's a boozer, bro You don't have to take him seriously at all, bro Why, 'master'? My father died when I was a kid Couldn't bear the hunger I stole and got caught They piled cases on me And sent me to this Ju...Juvenile Home, bro We are being released tomorrow But he is asking me to surrender for a murder case, bro If my mother gets to know this she will die of shock, bro If you had called me instead of calling that master I'm emotional by nature you see I would have assigned someone else to surrender Not wanting to surrender isn't a mistake on your part But you wanted to sneak our internal information Isn't that a grave mistake? Grown-up boy, you tell me What you did was wrong or not? - Yes, it was wrong - So I am right? Enough of eating 'biriyani' I'll take it You've had enough Here, take this Aren't we both very young, bro? Think of us as your younger brother and please forgive us this time My dear, only boys like you should not be pardoned They pardoned me Look how it has shaped me How do we deal with this? We won't repeat this, bro We won't snitch to anyone Listen, you can be scared of anyone in this world But if death knocks at our door ...even if it is Lord Yama you shouldn't be scared I'll give you 2 minutes Kill me and then save your brother and yourself What were you doing when these kids stole your phone? On top of it you have this stuck up attitude! - Go away - I won't leave you Listen to me Just run away - Run outside - I won't go Mess up all my orders Only plus is your voice! I won't go You have only 1 minute left Decide fast Go away from here I won't leave you alone 'What are you doing?' 'Don't, bro' This is what I expected from you! Clear out I won't leave you Brother...! Wake up, bro Get up I'm constable Arumugam Get up, bro School starts only at 10'o clock Why are you waking me- We have a problem on hand Inspector wants to see you Why should I meet the inspector? You have to get up now Not realizing the gravity of the situ- Okay, I'll get up Don't shake me up like a rattle! Go, I'll follow 'I will come' "You say you heard a rumor" "And it's time I let you know" Start...make it quick "You won't need, won't need no ruler" "If delinquents like us lament in pain will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?" 'Not too sure, sir' 'I think they were here for less than a year' "2 innocent boys here Lost their lives so dear" 'I am in the crime spot, sir' "To reside here or hang by a rope One and the same without hope" 'What are you gawking at, huh?' Yov! Who are you? - Get out - Sir...sir He is our class master Oh! You are that master, huh? First I have to interrogate you What did you do? This has never happened before Did you hit any of the boys? Tell me Can't you hear me? Answer, man Sir, what is this? Not here, I need to take him for inquiry 'Get him into our police jeep' 'Search all the rooms in case they left any suicide note' "We want to reform given a choice We are good-for-nothing boys" "If delinquents like us lament in pain will our voice be heard; or is it in vain?" "If good-for-nothing louts wail will our voice make justice prevail?" 'N2 Police Station Vadaseri' Bhavani, can we come with you? He has asked me to come by myself, I can handle it What about...that master who is in police custody? I came out of the reformatory 15 years ago Reason I've been patient for the past 5 years I wanted to kill these 3 men and become the president of the Drivers' union 2 men are dead and gone This is the last one to go down He has sent for me Is he my priority? Or is this master important? He's only important - What shall we do with this master? - I'll handle him - Sure? - No problem - Shall I go now? - I'll go Let's go Come with me Where are you going? - 2 minutes, sir - Quick, sir will be here anytime 'Are you the mother of those 2 boys who died?' - 'Yes, sir - Is that so?' 'Give him all the details' Boozed upto your brow, huh? - 'Sit outside - Okay, sir' If someone is calling you 10 times from the same number ...won't it occur to you it may be a serious problem? No, Ch...Charu Why are you staring so blankly? I was a volunteer in an NGO before I took up this post here Based on a complaint I went for inspection to that Observation Home That's how I befriended those 2 boys They told me about the injustice in that reformatory But I couldn't take any legal action So many vile threats The only reason I shifted to Chennai was to handle such cases myself I needed to be financially secure So I took up this lecturer's post When you defended the students my faith was recharged I was convinced this flawed system could be changed for the better I forged your signature for this post Even for your job I was the one who applied Even the founder is aware of this Now I feel that was a big mistake If you hadn't come here at least those 2 boys would be alive Now both of them have left us How can you defend yourself, sir? See, I had no idea whatsoever No one told me anything When have you been sober enough to understand? Have you ever realized anytime who is talking to you? I have my share of personal problems I am unable to come out of it I can't ...cry I can't cry, I can't sleep at night either, that's why I drink I swear I never thought it would be this horrific Oh! You can never cry, right? 'I can't understand 'Tell me without crying' Charu, where are yo- - Were your boys into drugs? - I never thought I would see them dead This is the lady who gave birth to those boys who are dead now I had reassured her A master will come 'He will save your boys' Both my sons are very fond of each other They stick together like glue My eldest told me just last week 'Let my younger brother study I'll find some job to support us' 'A master was coming he said' He was sure they will be rescued But no one came 'My entire lineage has snapped' Yov! Where are you? Hurry up 'Listen to him' Bring your wife - Yov! Come here - You can go 'He has gone back to his old ways' - Sir - Who are they? She is that master's colleague it seems Pack them all off and move that master to the cell Okay, sir Yov! Clear the other cases out of the station Okay, sir 'What will I do now?' 'How will I live without them?' 'Even now you're so hard hearted?' Your eyes won't shed tears till the day you die Get even more sloshed 'Why are you lamenting here? Shut up now' I said shut up Do I have to repeat myself? Clear this place now, madam Clear out Come with me, sir I swear- Come along, sir Standing rooted to the spot I swear I didn't expect any of this Don't forget you are also responsible for the death of those 2 boys Convey my apologies to their mother You are taking undue advantage of the respect I'm giving you Don't make me lose my temper Stand right there I sacrificed my children in such an awful unjust way 'Hey! Come here' Go inside - 'You want a mosquito repellent! - Don't hit, it hurts' Listen, Bhavani Only you and I are left to contest the Lorry Drivers' Union election I have to win unopposed 'Looks like it may rain' Can we have tea and then discuss? [sniffles] 'Master, my name is Sabari' 'My elder brother is Manikandan' 'He stole from a bakery for my sake because I was starving' 'But they foisted some other case on us and brought us here' 'Everything is wrong here, master' 'They thrash us mercilessly' 'They stuff some powder into our mouths' 'Immediately even our teeth start shivering, master' 'Don't know if it is day or night' 'We put up with all this thinking it is for a short period' 'Now when we are about to be released' '...they want us to surrender for some other murder case' 'Otherwise they are threatening to kill our mother, master' 'Sister Charu assured us you will come and be our savior, rescue us' 'Please save us, master' 'Our poor mother' 'She is all alone' 'Crying nonstop daily' 'I can't cry anymore, master' 'Please, brother Rescue us from this hell' 'I am begging you, brother' Go ahead I told you, Bhavani I want to win unopposed I called you here to arrive at a compromise But still I can't trust you You'll take any kind of cruel measure using those juvenile delinquents Should I step out of my house daily with fear in every breath I exhale? That is why- Did you call me here planning to kill me? You- You call someone with a plan to kill him Treat him royally like a guest and offer him hot tea You're the only man who asked me for permission to kill Instead you could have- Putting you on a pedestal, I wanted to fix an auspicious day to finish you off I need my brain examined! 'Hey! Wait' I'll give you 2 minutes Kill me and then save your men and yourself 'Hurry up' Do you need an army to bash up 1 man? Open the door first Hey, he is a master Watch your blows You have only 10 minutes Come out without too much damage Turn the other way [indistinct] Come, Murali Switch it off and come Even if you are reborn pray I don't set eyes on you! Don't, Bhavani Wonder what their plan is! Master, my boss has given you a bus ticket 'Luxury bus Air-condition sleeper' Leave tonight, you'll reach your hometown in the morning Got it into your head? 'If you stubbornly refuse' You saw the 2 boys hanging from the roof? You'll be next I'm talking to you Is that a love letter in your hand? Sabari, Manikandan [reading under his breath] Refusing to surrender in the murder case and ended up dead, those 2 tramps- Sir, the noise is too loud Ignore, we'll handle it Sir, the noise is ear-splitting - Go in and check - Okay 'Stab him and rip him apart' Sir? They may kill that master Please come here, sir Yov Soundar! Open the damn door Soundar - Tell me - BHAVANI! The master- Who are you? Who is behind this? What is your motive? Why do you use these innocent boys? I don't know any of this But I will find out 'Hiding behind these boys and framing them, neck deep in crime' I will catch those sissy fellows I'll hunt high and low, find you and stand right in front of you I will- I will make you answer for the death of those 2 boys Master Whatever I'm about to say is nothing new for you Still I'll say it and you listen I'm waiting! [confident laughter] Wait, I say I will meet you face to face "He stands for powerful victory" - "Who is he? - Thalapathy...!" 'Das, I'm very scared' 'He is back again Is there no one to save me?' 'Aiyaiyo! "Don't spoil for a fight unnecessarily" "If you give us hell foolhardily a stone will split your skull speedily" Master, you've been staring at the rope for a long time? Want to play on it as a swing? What is that famous song of his? Let me tell a 'kutti' story Hey chee chee! Not short, da Sad story! "Let me tell a sad story" "Zip lip, or slip Skip and trip" "Chillax, master!" "Take a deep breath, master" Hey master! "Cheers to your beers!" 'Youths to the youngest ones are doped day and night, bro' 'When they are intoxicated they are not in control of their senses' 'Both have plenty of criminal cases against them' '2 boys who died are sheer poison' 'Both must have died when totally tanked, sir' 'They won't toe the line with their parents or with our rules' They are arrogant boys who insist their word is law 'There are 10-12 year olds with all kinds of diseases in here' All dazed and doped Who told you they were good-for-nothing boys? Both are 24 carat gold, sir Both those boys who died They called a girl I know on the night they died You mean Charu? Yes, Charu I know Charu and I know who killed those 2 boys too We have tried our level best But we are unable to stop the dope and booze supply How can drugs enter the premises without your knowledge, sir? They have so many routes to supply, sir Without the wardens' support '...nothing can be brought in, sir' As per our rule book, no violence on our boys who are all below 18 here Using that as an excuse they will bring the roof down! Presuming others' fears are their plus ...these are riff-raffs who rule the roost Poor chaps! Trapped for life caught in Bhavani's web Who is Bhavani? Beast! - Bhava...Bhavani? - Don't know anyone by that name Sir, don't simply keep asking questions You got any other work, carry on, okay? See you, sir? Let's go 'Teachers who came here earlier to reform these boys' ...would have made a hasty retreat thinking their family takes priority But my story is completely different I have no one to call my own, sir 'The day I saw those 2 boys hang right in front of my eyes' Their eyes bulging Tongues sticking out I died, sir If you can help me I will change this place and bring order and fair play here Whatever hardship comes my way I don't care even if I lose my life "My life's breath" I have no problem, sir If you stick to rules & regulations here, even move heaven and earth legally I will back you up 100%, sir "High time I stop needing a high from you" "Enough of (s)tumbling thanks to you!" "Today my troubled times will heal anew" "Enough of being sloshed night & day Get it out of your system today" "Enough of gifting yourself strife Switch off this dizzying life" "No more booze to give a kick Quit now, double quick" "Break the bottles, you surely should Trash them for your own good" "Enough of being drunk as a skunk Get it out of your system as junk" Forgive me, ma "No more daily booze session Quit this deadly addiction" "Break this habit, begin life anew Trash the bottles now, dude" "Enough of this, night & day Get it out of your system today" "Enough of this dependence Switch off without a fuss" "Enough of being a slave to craving Quit drinking; no more depraving" "Break the bottles and the habit Trash them for your own benefit" You got me wrong, Bhavani Ever since Gurumurthy died ...everyone is scared to contest for that post I've spoken to the district councilor In another 10 days ...it will be announced you won unopposed Come here Bro, she is the one putting a spoke in the wheel She registered the case it seems Our boys sent her photo just now What should we do with her? Can't you handle a female? As if you need a priest to choose an auspicious time! Get lost! Bhavani, even if someone else occupies this post as union leader Anyway whatever you say will be law Then why aspire for this post? Fear stemming out of murder is short lived But fear derived from a post of power and authority lasts a lifetime, right? After this I'm entering politics Don't know how many heads will roll to make that dream come true I don't get it, Bhavani Our boys will shoulder the sin "They call me master Changes will happen faster" Hey master! - 'Looking tip-top like a new groom? - Correct, man' He looks different, right? 'Master is in a mood to teach us a lesson' Do you think he's married? 'If he was married' And if his wife looks hot Soooper, no?!?? All of you stand height-wise Shorter ones in front Taller ones in the back Come on, fast If you come clean shaven and yell you think we'll get scared? - 'Move on to your next job - At least pretend to be scared' Poor master! Let me repeat Fall in line Stand height-wise Master, don't judge a book by its cover Instead of height try weight as a measure This chap like a buffalo here 'Pickpocket case Real pipsqueak' But our little black ant had the guts to kill Cut above the rest Then isn't he the heaviest? What is your name? You heard me? What is your name? Master, you can't lay a finger on us Know that, right? Sir, you can't lay a finger on the boys Rules 'Don't hit them and get caught unnecessarily' 'Like a new starched shirt, sir is all stiff and spruced up' "Master's raid beginning" "A-Aa-E-Ee, A-B-C-D This is our time, buddy" "Come, brother, welcome" It is wrong only if I bash up the boys?

"Don't run over him and look the other way" "Don't get into his bad books, stay away" "Master's raid, no warranty Pain 100% guarantee" It hurts, sir Please don't hit Sir, I'm going to Sabarimala I have taken the 48 days vow Why?

'I have collected cavity samples from the 6 boys you mentioned' - How long will it take? - I'll let you know in 1 or 2 days Thanks, Madhi He left me with a half shaved moustache and beard Such a disgrace! I feel like I am naked! I'm so mad I feel like sta- 'I feel like stabbing him right now' When you get your hands dirty enemies will come and go If we rage like a mad bull against every single enemy, our life will be ruined Handle him with patience 'Make him run in all 4 directions' Don't let him sleep - Torture him mentally - Fine - 'Hey-' - I'll tackle him [overlap of angry voices] Hey! Come out 'Listen to me I'm telling you boys' 'Listen to me' 'Wait, da' - What happened? - Sir, I don't know They just started a brawl and hit each other Back door is open in A block What to do now? Go look for the key Hurry up Quick, man Don't let anyone out Lock them up in the class - Okay, bro - Give me the torch 'You'll get bashed up' Get lost! Hello, bro - 'Yes, tell me' - None of our boys are missing I hope Bro, head count is correct 63 'Not one of them is missing' 'They came from outside for sure' 'Aiyo! It's burning!' Aiyo! You're hurting me Aiyaiyo! Bala 'What happened to you?' 'You messed up my face, right?' 'Go, collect your mess' 'This is just the beginning, master' 'Hit them at least once, master' Hey master! This is your fate every single minute you are here Don't think this is the end There's more to come We will escape from here tonight Try to stop us if you can 'I was on my bike sticking to the kerb side' Whether he collided by mistake or deliberately targeted me 'Only God knows' 'But his intention is to provoke you' Only then you'll get angry and show your fist power on a handful of boys 'They will use that as excuse and pack you off from here' 'Don't act rashly on impulse' Only his leg is fractured Hand is intact, right? [kabaddi-chatter] Sorry, da I couldn't do anything to help you It's okay, forget it What can you do? My fear is those grown up boys are waiting to pounce on us in kabaddi And we have to play against those beefy buffaloes it seems In case we lose... ...we'll be 'alti' this entire month 'Alti' means? Being an errand boy To be under their beck and call Do all their dirty jobs like a slave I'll anyway lose 'I am agreeable to being an 'alti' but they insist I should play, master' I snitched to you, right? Using Kabaddi as an excuse as if it's just a game '...they plan to bash me up, master' 'Hey Undiyal...!' Come, da Look here Look at me 'I am calling you...dai!' Coming or shall I lift you and bring you here to play? More than the aches from blows and kicks Pain from fear hurts deeper! Go with courage, da Go and check what he's doing Das, he is coming Tell me, Madhi You snitched about us to the master, right? - Face us now - Hey! I know very well, da If Bala plays we will win for sure So you got scared and broke his hand, right? Had he been here would he have defeated us? For sure then you would have lost pathetically Call whomever, how many ever boys you want from here to play on your side I'll call anyone I want but then you can't go back on your word Call, we won't send you back without breaking all your teeth today! MAAASTER! "Clash of wills here" "You are ready for your bier" [song from 'Ghilli'] "Kabaddi...kabaddi...do hold your breath" "Kabaddi...kabaddi...to show your strength" - Tell me, Madhi - 'I checked the results' I am sure all 6 of them are above 20 years of age "Kabaddi...kabaddi...play" "On your mark, get set full gear Sandalwood paste smeared" "One foot in the grave, no fear You are ready for your bier" What are you saying? Not one of them is less than 18? 100% sure, in those 6 boys no one is younger than 18 "On your mark, get set, ready" "Bash them up deadly" Master,. at least do you know the name of this game? 'This is not cricket or football' You must hold your breath and repeat 'kabaddi', you know? Our rules are different You can't just touch and run You must toss your opponent outside the line What...still want to play? Come on, da "Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi...play" Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi You're out if you step out of the line "On your mark, get set, full gear" "Sandalwood paste smeared here" Trying your tricks with us? "You are ready for your bier" "Your downfall is marked" Bingo! 'He got a solid slap' Knock him down 'He deserves it!' - Soooper, master - Come...face on He is hitting us real hard If you have the guts show it now Come...come on Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi Kabaddi...kabaddi...kabaddi Lift him You dare lay a finger on us Just you wait and watch!

Master...? - What? - Is it okay to talk frankly? - Camera is recording everything - Go on, doesn't matter I'll tell you, master My mother passed away when I was born My neighbor sister raised me My father asked that sister if she will sleep with him! That's why I threw the grinding stone on his head Immediately the police put me in jail 'That's when I got trapped with brother Das' From then on I had to listen only to what brother Das says Brother Das will walk in He will check who is addicted to drugs Powder, smoke, booze He will increase the dosage Which one of you here ...has seen Bhavani? Bhavani? Where have I heard this name? 'Somehow sounds familiar' Master We have heard this name But none of us have seen him Brother Das is 'be all and end all' here We must obey him implicitly 'If he asks us to surrender we should do so with our eyes closed' Otherwise we will be hanged 'They recently hanged 2 boys' 'Didn't you see that, master?' Do you all want to go home and live with your family? Or do you want to surrender? - Go home, master - Be with our family You have been here for 10 days We haven't taken to drugs till now Only now we know our own selves Somehow save us from here, master If you follow what I say, you can go home and live as you wish Will you do as I say? - Yes, master - We will Whatever you shared with me now will you tell the same to the magistrate? Of course we will, master I'll arrange all the formalities to get them out on parole Thanks, sir Let the video evidence be with Charu till then It will reach the magistrate when you say so Master, you shot some video and cleverly made us confess You haven't shared your story Tell us Let's listen 'Ask him, da' Cat got your tongue, huh? - Tell us - Tell us, master 'Please share your story, master' We are asking, right? Please tell us Don't ask for trouble Trust my voice of experience! Wait, they are very eager to hear I'll be happy to share Let them enjoy I was in college then 'I think it was my final year' A new teacher joined our college Her name was Malar Unbelievable one in a million 'Love' All of a sudden that girl I loved ...met with an accident 'She forgot her past' She didn't even know who I was She even forgot my mad love for her Fate made me attend her wedding present a bouquet with my own hands! After tha- Dai! Why are all of you sniffling and crying? Now that girl has totally forgotten our past Master, isn't that teacher sister Charu?

Follow me 'They started chasing me when I was on my way to the magistrate's house' I don't know what to do or where to go Charu, don't be scared 'I will send our boys' Go inside some shop there 'Enter a shop to be safe' 'Thank you for calling, Parandhaman' - I've come into a shop, sir - Turn on the speaker What do you need? 'Bro, 1 minute please Listen to what I have to say' 'Let this girl hide in your shop for a while' I'll send my men, please My business will get affected Don't involve me, clear out Aren't you a fiery blooded youth? 'Speak boldly' Bro, I'll take care - 'You don't worry' - Thank you, brother Come here, dear - Did a girl come in here? - No "My dark and bold beau why was he Uncle Scrooge?" "He made my heart soft and cottony quake with desire; explode in rhapsody" "Tell me the auspicious time when wedding bells will chime?" [song from 'Pudhu Nellu Pudhu Naathu'] - Master, they are teasing m- - Sshhhhhhhhhh! "He made my heart soft and cottony quake with desire; explode in rhapsody" 'I told you no one came in here' 'Bro, where are you going in?' 'Listen' 'He already told you no one is here' Oldie, shut up Give it of your own accord Or else just 2 punches I'll smash your face If I have to grab it from you- - Dai...dai - Wait, master This face looks familiar 'Sister' 'Turn your phone towards him' Hey Undiyal...! 'Hey Button, my dear friend!' Undiyal, da What are you doing in this video call? Dai, the girl you are chasing is my sister - 'Your sister? - Yes' I didn't know that I was asked to finish her That's way I chased her But tell me, why are you chasing her? - What is that? - She has a camera I believe she has a camera Ask her to give it and we'll leave Sister, give him what he wants We will deal with this differently 'Okay?' 'Just give it, sister' "My eyes can't close at night without leaning on your chest in delight" 'Hey Button' I told you she's my sister I didn't hear your apology? - Apologize to her - Sorry, sister 'Hey! You boys too' Sorry, sister Glad you are that scared of me!

What are you doing? Look What is this tattoo? This branding? When boys are sent to this Home Brother Das will pick up the sharp ones and train us When we get released, he will tattoo our hand with this Tamil letter 'pa' If we show this tattoo in the Mess, we can eat to our stomach's content If you are older, you'll get plenty of booze and cigarettes You can get clothes for free from their textile shop They will even get you dope from a pharmacy But the hitch is Every now and then, they will make us surrender for a crime Not to get back into the old bad ways, I'm staying aloof 'We have heard this name But none of us have seen him' 'Brother Das is 'be all and end all' here' 'We must obey him implicitly' - Is it a newly released film? - 'No one can defy him' 'He asks you to surrender we should, with our eyes closed' How did you lose track of her? Don't know how, Bhavani I sent only professionals - Somehow they messed up- - Shut up! What do we do with this, bro? It has a card inside which stores whatever we shoot or click Break that card alone and keep the camera at my place Okay When are they announcing the results? Heard it's Monday or Tuesday You'll anyway win unopposed Why should you be tense? - I can enjoy, right? - Yes, then what? Sit here Do you know this ostrich? A bird with a long neck like this Have you seen its egg? It will be this big So big in size But only that ostrich will know the pain of hatching such an egg! Will you sit here even after I've explained to you? No, Bava - Get lost! - No, Bhavani Bhavani, boys want a booze party You won't anyway drink At least for them- Drink to dig your own grave - Go ahead - Thanks a lot, Bhavani - 'Goodnight, Bava' - Goodnight Somehow you made me show you this place I was staying away from this place Let's go back, master Wait, I have a good reason We'll go soon 'Right, you haven't come here to eat' - 'What happened to my chicken 'pakoda'? - Narayana, serve him' I thought you were inviting me for a candle light dinner Last time I came here, there was no power They had lit only candles Okay, relax Don't look at this place I heard the food here is super 'Get a token for the meals' 'Madam, you too' I thought we'll have some privacy Close your eyes and show me your right hand - Why? - Show, I'll tell you You shouldn't open your eyes till I tell you 'Open now' That boy's hand in the salon had this same mark Show this over there Ask for 'meals' token Why should I- All for a good reason Go and show your hand Who the hell is he? 'We don't differentiate or discriminate' 'Whoever has a Tamil letter 'pa' tattooed on their hands...' ...we give them whatever they ask Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest What is this for? Still some balance left in my bucket list! "Let the drums beat; no restraint Let the party rock; no constraint" "Let our army smash and slam Our earth will quake with the wham" "My hands will never miss a beat when I beat the drum ever so neat" "Even the dormant nerve will dance hearing my drum's resonance" 'Beat it!' "Till the sun rises to a new day let the ground shake and sway" "Till the game is won, job is done slow down but have your fun" "Even the Lord of Death Yama will die if he glares with his razor sharp eye" 'Hey boy!' "Light the camphor for our Lord He is possessed by our demi-god" "Look high and low diligently Every nook & corner and alley" "There is no other big gun to defy Or create a ruckus and vilify" 'Bhavani!' That master is churning in my mind Tell him to kill that master tomorrow before day break Why wait till tomorrow morning? We can close his chapter right now Shut your gob Just do what I say "Let the force of his punching fist make the drumhead rip and split" "Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo! Announce who struck the blow" 'You there!' "Let the force of his punching fist make the drumhead rip and split" "Let 'sound' listen to the thump and lo! Announce who struck the blow" "Shaking his stupor, without a doubt he is all set to rip your gut out" "To hang you upside down and skin you alive is his vow" 'Master...!' "Let the drums roll; no restraint Let the party rock; no constraint" "Let our army smash and slam Our earth will quake with the wham" "My hands will never miss a beat when I beat the drum; it's a royal treat" "Even the dormant nerve will dance hearing my drum's resonance" 'Rock & roll' "Till the sun rises to a new day let the ground shake and sway" Give me Dinkie Dow if you have I don't stock drugs "Even the Lord of Death Yama will die if he glares with his razor sharp eye" 'Hey boy' "Light the camphor for our Lord He is possessed by our demi-god" "Got the man with the plan right here" "Bringin' swag with the man right here" Forward all the videos to the police department I'll bring the boys to the Magistrate directly Okay Master This is Bhavani brother's truck I've heard he comes here often Let's go there Aiyaiyo! Are you joking, master? I am not coming You go if you want "A whole night of merry-making" "Day spent in sleep overtaking" "This is the world we rejoice Reveling in unforbidden joys" "A whole night of merry-making Day spent in sleep overtaking" "This is the world we rejoice Reveling in unforbidden joys" "A whole night of partying" [song from 'Navarathiri'] "This is our universe for better or worse" You move I'll stab you Walk straight ahead "What existed before birth" Knock, da "Even you can't unearth" To top it all a secret code! "What happens after we die Even I don't know the right reply" If any hand reaches out to his weapon He will end up a corpse Kneel, man - Kneel down - Switch off the song Damn, switch it off! Who is Bhavani here? Huh? Which one of you here has seen Bhavani? What kind of sissy name is that...Bhavani? Was he lying on his stomach as a baby when he was named? Shabaa! Let me make it clear once more If any of you do something stupid trying to retaliate I'll sign on your man's Adam's apple, got it? 'Try your luck flinging another bottle?' That means You know Bhavani very well Will you go and repeat this to him verbatim? Bhavani...Bhavani Bhavani...Bhavani A man walked in right royally knowing it is your den, Bhavani Repeat, da No, you tell me I'll convey it No, you are scared 'Listen, I might as well tell all of you' The day you killed those 2 boys in the Observation Home and hung them I hung my head in guilt and died I'm least bothered about myself hereafter Branding those juveniles with a tattoo and making them do your dirty work I've put a full stop to it From now on, anyone wants to do anything using the boys as lambs for the slaughter ...has to kill me and then go ahead but that has a slight hitch I will kill minimum 10 of you and only then breathe my last Be it Bhavani or Banumathi!!! Will you go and tell him word by word? Come, get up Close the door Who threw that bottle at me, da? Come here No, Bhavani I aimed it at him The pen will fall down and you can escape I thought 'But it missed and-' Hey! Lazy lout Open the door - 'Open the door - Madcap!' - Open the door, da - What false bravado! Son of a scumbag! Open it, damn you Where did you go? Open now, I'll kill you 'Hey! Open' 'How dare you lay a hand on Bhavani when I'm here?' - Kottamuthu - Come now - Hey Kottamuthu - What did you think of us? Bro is calling you Come here - What are you doing? - He locked us in He was holding a knife to my neck for an hour WTH were you doing then? Bhavani, that wasn't a knife - It was a pen - You knew it, huh? How will he open the door if you yell after he has gone? Shall we pen him a letter? 'Sir, please open the door' Don't hit me, Bhavani Who can draw very well here? Master, he is our best artist He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff all over the toilet and the walls, master 'Hi master' I believe you came to my den Threatened a man with a pen and conveyed an important message to Bhavani I am that Bhavani 'Vanakkam' If you destroy all that I own, textile shop, hotel, wine shop What the hell will he do? He is himself a criminal 'You assumed I won't go to the police, right?' Your assumption is 100% right But thinking you'll make a fool of me was wrong 'I enquired about you' I believe you have a big gang of ardent fan followers 'Which one of them can I finish off? I asked my boys their choice' They said we can have a jolly time killing them all without discrimination Let me give you a task Take a pen and paper' List out your favorites in alphabetical order Hey Bhavani! Don't ignore girls and kids thinking I'll be soft on them Include their names too definitely 'Write and call each one of them' And then...master? Give me the phone 'Hello...?' - Why did he hang up on me? - 'Must have got scared' Got very emotional I guess Why do emotional men get so hyper and angry? Pick...pick...pick up my call Pick up - Hi, dude - Where are you? I'm just leaving my office - You are safe? - Yes, what's the problem? 'Listen to me Don't step out' What is the proble- Come on, pick up - Sir? - WHERE ARE YOU? - Shut u- - 'I hope you're safe?' - 'Yes, sir, what happened?' - Listen Check if our batch students are safe, okay? 'Madhi, where is Srinath?' 'He is here, JD' - What is it? - 'Stay at home, don't go out' 'Everything safe?' JD called me 'He was so hassled' 'He told us not to step out' Guys, don't step out of your house Most important, avoid road travel 'In case you are out, go to any house or shop nearby or any safe place' 'JD sir called just now I think there's a major problem' 'If you are safe' For heaven's sake text our entire group Park the bike 'Almost everyone in the group texted they are safe' But we couldn't reach only Bhargav and Savitha, sir Don't swerve too much to the right Careful! Hello? I am safe- Vanathi, where are you? In a mall nearby What happened? - Is Prem with you? - 'Yes, da' He has gone to fetch my purse from the car- 'VANATHI, WHAT IS IT?' 'What happened, Vanathi?' 'VANATHI, TALK TO ME What is it? VANATHI - 'Where are you, da?' - Theater, why, sir? - Are you alright? - What happened? SIR...! SRI DAI! SIR! Hey! Hey! Get out - What happened? - Savitha, go 'Bhargav' BHARGAV! 'Bhargav...!' 'SIR!' Sir...! Bhargav is dead, sir "Got the man with the plan right here" "Bringin' swag with the-" Master How many wickets down? 'According to the News I got' 2 wickets down 2 retired hurt If you are still stubborn enough to hang out with that gang ...you'll lose 4 wickets daily 'I have never forgiven anyone who has crossed my path till now' This is my first time and I am forgiving you Just quit your job, do an 'about turn' and disappear from this town 'Otherwise one who escaped today will die tomorrow and repeat' It will go on repeat mode They will keep falling like ninepins Thank you and good bye Hey...hey! Master...master 'The main reason I called you' I didn't lie face down when I was named it seems I was on my back it was clear as a bell! - Hey - 'Aahn' - DAI! - 'Hahn?' I'll dice you, dry and pickle you to pieces Thank you Goodbye Take care of them just for today I'll be back soon Don't worry, you go 'I will ensure the safety of these boys' - Aiyo! Let go of me, bro - Shut up, get into the truck - Bro, let go of me - Hit you Where are you taking me? - I'm not coming, bro - Das! Hey! Come here Das, he's throwing a tantrum - Lift him - Don't force me, bro - No...no - Bloody well listen Save me, warden Don't do this, Das Save us somehow, warden - Don't take them - Let me go, bro Move it 'Hey Das! Where are you taking the boys?' [mobile ringing] "Bringin' swag with the man right here" 'Hello, sir I'm Thulukanam speaking' 'Das and his boys have locked us in here' 'He has taken the boys who turned approvers' 'In a truck somewhere, sir' 'We don't know what to do Please come soon, sir' [mobile ringing] Yes, Vanathi 'This is not the end of the world for us' You have gone out of your way for these boys, enough 'I have informed the higher authorities They said they will be here soon' "He was chewing betel leaves in bliss I punched his nose without a miss" "You should have seen blood gush out This Amaran's heart is gold, no doubt" [Singing a song from 'Amaran'] "Just utter the name 'Amaran', bro soda bottles will fly at our foe" I don't care two hoots about the repercussion I'll take full blame Beat the hell out of them Hold this "It's a lilting tune anyone can hum" "Amaran is a seasoned singer awesome" "He was chewing betel leaves in bliss I punched his nose without a miss" "Should have seen his nose bleed This Amaran's heart is gold indee-" Master...master, da Back again? Plan to hit us? Go ahead Come here Think you've achieved something great in life Shout all you want Dai! Bhargav He is dead, da Bhargav created much more trouble in college than all of you put together He is dead now If a real rowdy reforms and just when he wants to lead a good life, if he dies- Do you know it is the height of cruelty? The faith people around him have to turn over a new leaf will vanish Oh my gawd! Master has started preaching to us Ignore them, bro Why do you treat them on an equal footing with you? These mongrels won't reform even if they die! Yov! Who will reform? When have we treated him with respect? Or given him time, place or an opportunity to reform? Undiyal, Odacha Kadalai, Bottle Mani, Soda Sekar, what kind of names? Then how will they remember their family or tender love and care? Family and society alienate them If everybody has exiled him how will he reform? Come here, da What? 1st crime by many boys here is based on emotion quotient Affection, betrayal, anger, or a rush of adrenalin Each with a reason But after the first time You know what instigates you to commit every crime you pile on to your account? Intoxication! I can bet on this, da All other crimes after your 1st was committed losing control of your senses Didn't you booze? Didn't you have a ball? Oh! Yes, sir Open your warped mind! Only a drunkard can talk of how it ruined his family Only because of my addiction 2 boys lost their lives I got that into my thick head I quit drinking 'Chee! Don't be a drama king, master!' Am I brewing liquor at home? Blaming the buyer instead of the seller! That's exactly what I'm saying This intoxication is a political game You are not yet 18 years You can't watch this Adult film A security guard stands out to push you out, right? Why is no one standing guard outside a wine shop? How do 10 -15 year olds get hold of a booze bottle and cigarette? Politics Bhavani is moving his pawn and playing this kind of politics When the law is against child labor ...that beast is forcing the same boys into nefarious activities unwillingly What is this? What is it? Like bribing you to vote and you end up with an inked finger He gives you freebies and brands you with a tattoo He has bathed you in basic amenities providing free food and clothing Good lord! Enough of this atrocity You have packed those boys who believed they have a good future into that truck Don't know if they will hang from a fan or be run over by a tyre But I will save them Every single one of them What did he say, da? He will kill all those who like me? Hey! [ironical laughter] There are zillions outside who like me Mind, body, heart and soul, da Ask him to try his luck 'Bro, Bhavani has loaded the documents, money bags of his 'benamis' in his lorries' 'He is planning to cross the border tonight' 'The boys are in one of the trucks, bro' Bhavani All 40 lorries have crossed the border Expected anytime now Those boys? Das is bringing them in the container Go Finish her off! Vanathi...Vanathi Run over her Vanathi Vanathi, take the wheel Come...come Bang his car and kill them Come...come 'Stop...stop' If those 15 boys turn approvers whom will they point their fingers at? Das of course They have never met you, Bhavani What if Das turns approver? Your name, Bhavani Then kill Das Go Go, da Do you want him to kill me out of your sight? Your words came to my mind 'I will give my life for you' Give it now I thought of you as my own elder brother I regarded you as my brother Even I thought of you as my very own younger brother 'What do you want me to do?' Where are the boys? Where are they, da? Hey! Go and check the container Go...move it Bloody- Let's see who wins You or me? Das, listen to me Listen to me JUST LISTEN! Hear me out Oral statement by all those boys point fingers accusingly only at you They don't even know the name Bhavani Bhavani knows that too Give it serious thought Will he kill all the boys? Or kill the one they are pointing fingers at, which is YOU? - You deserve to die - In one swift blow, I'll- That is not my intention Let's stop with the lives already lost I'm saying this like a broken record Bhavani is clever He won't kill the boys His target is YOU Listen to me once Only this time Ask him if you can bring the boys in front of him he will say 'no' Continue to ask repeatedly You'll know the true colors of Bhavani If this doesn't happen- I am all yours to kill "Master" "They call me...master" "You know me...master" "I am master the blaster" "Oooh yeah!" "Master" "They call me...master" Welcome, master This is the first time we are meeting, right? Loaded with emotion, huh? My dear master Bhavani isn't just a name It's a kingdom I created for myself You can't create a world record with your overnight lesson If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom what about the mud between your ears? You carried that boy on your waist? Did you think they are kids? They are killers of the worst kind I've already given you too much time Still I'll give you 2 minutes If you can ki- Master, why did you hit me in mid speech? Didn't you ask for it? Come Is this all the force you can muster? Master [fired up laughter] Job done and dusted 'Lord, pardon this sinner' Don't! Hey!

Each person has to endure the punishment according to his crime Madcap! I feel I should do something for you Tell me if you have a family I'll take care of them till you're back I overheard the children in the reformatory saying you loved a girl it seems A girl from an affluent family Already engaged to someone Shall I go and talk to her? Maybe I can share my epic story! Listen, my dear boy My name was not JD then Jack Daniels People called me 'Jack' I used to draw well Good at a game of cards In such a game we were lucky My friend and I won 2 tickets You would have seen everyone run to catch a bus or train But imagine we ran and caught a ship about to leave the dock Huh? That's where I set eyes on her for the very 1st time Her name was Rose What did you say her name was? Rose Rose...Jack Listen to my love story After I fell head over heels in love with her, I found out ...she's already engaged After that, as we were sailing smoothly The ship hit an iceberg on the way? How do you know that? I'll wait outside, master - Listen to my full epic love story - No need, it's okay, master 'Since manipulation of boys into crimes by anti social elements was proved' 'With the aid of proper evidence' 'That specific Govt Reformatory was shut down permanently' 'Of the 63 inmates, those above 18 were sent to Central Prison' 'And those below 18 were sent to other Govt reformatories' Your fingerprint over there Go inside What is the crime you are serving term for? Baby face, partner Must be a gigolo Look at his face Like a parcel folded into four Juveniles of Nagercoil in that Bhavani case I heard it was 7 of them Only 6 are here Baby face is here Handsome face is missing Where is your master? Must have been sent to Vellore jail It's even more convenient, partner We go to Vellore in 10 days We'll finish him there Then we will meet your master in Vellore Transfer only after 10 days, huh? - Are you here till then? - Why? Drag that 'beedi' deep into your lungs This is the last 'beedi' you'll smoke Over dramatic punch line! You're teaching ME about the 'prisoner'!!
