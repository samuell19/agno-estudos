Uh, uh, all right, all right. Listen, Mr. Spann, just relax. I'll dispatch someone as soon as possible. What... what... what is soon as possible? Well, listen, I don't have anyone available just now. - I'll call you back. - All right, well, I... listen, we're in a bit of an emergency here, okay? There's truck drivers everywhere.

I'll come myself if I have to. Okay. Okay, thank you. Just be as quick as you can, okay? Stay by your phone, keep your phone on, and stay put. Oh, shit. We're not in. Please leave a message. Hey, Barry, Anna, it's Will. Can you guys call me back? I'm lookin' for Lisa. Thank you, bye. Fuck. Lisa? I think that's them, sweetie. - Lisa. - You got it? Hi, Will. - Hi. - Oh. - Hey, how are you? - Hey, I'm good. Where's Lisa? Uh, I... I was gonna ask you the same thing. Is she here? No, she's not... she's with you. No, she was with me. - Lisa! - Hello. - Well, she's not here. - Okay, okay. - Barry! - Yes, sweetie. Hi. - Hey, Barry! - Will's here. - Um, I... I, uh... - What's the matter? I don't know. Something's wrong. What? You guys didn't hear from her? She didn't call? - No, she's... is it... - What? No. I... I... I thought maybe she came here. Uh, no, wait a second. No, uh... uh, weren't you supposed - to drop her off here? - Yeah. Uh, one minute she was here, the next minute she was gone. Uh, what uh, what do you mean by that? What do you mean she's gone? We stopped to get gas, and she went into the market, and... - Right. - She didn't come back out. I don't... She's still in the gas station then. No, she's not still in the gas station. - I... - Is she in the... In the bathroom? Did you check... I've looked in the restrooms, I've looked... Yes, I checked the whole damn gas station. Okay, which ga... Which gas station were you're at? Let's start there. The Veldro on uh, you know, 64. Okay, that's about five miles from here, so she wouldn't walk from there. So, I have to ask you this, Will, uh, did you have a fight? Is that what this is? You had a fight and... No, Barry, we didn't have a fight. We're going through some stuff as... as you know, but we did not have a fight. And I can't explain... Okay, listen, did she have anybody else know she was comin'? Any friends or anything or anybody that... Just friends. But did you speak to any of her friends? No, wait a second. Wait, wait, wait! Now uh, listen, what are you saying? That it's because of us? Is that it? - I'm not blamin' anybody. - Now, that's insane. You know, anybody else who she was... No, no, please, it's insulting. What are you talkin' about, Barry! - I'm not blaming anybody! - Okay. - You did! - I... I'm just... That... that was the implication. Do you have any friends here? I asked if you knew she was coming here. Okay! Okay, guys, you can think what you want, but this is me, Will, all right? - No, I... - I... I... and this... I know, but it's not Will and Lisa. You see, we were expecting Will and Lisa. Yeah, okay. Well, let's get about finding Lisa, okay? I'm uh, I gotta go by. I called the police and they're comin' at the gas station. - You guys stay here. - Okay. Just in case she comes. And maybe call her friends, see if anybody heard from her. - Right. - Yeah. Right? And call me if you're hear anything. - I will, I promise. - Of course. All right. Oh my God. No, we're gonna call the cops right now. What do you mean call her friends? - What the fuck is that? - I don't ev... I don't understand what he said. I don't even know if I believe him that he called the cops.. I don't either. I don't trust him! This doesn't make any sense. Oh, it makes sense to me. Uh, he was acting weird. Did you see him? Ooh! Hey. I got the steering column workin'. Oh yeah? Yeah, cables were... were fried. Oh. Hmm. Maybe it's time to get her wet. - You want a drink? - No. No, thanks. - Okay, I'm gonna have a beer. - Okay. You okay? No. What's the matter? Will, um... - I think we need a break. - Oh, Christ. W... I... I... uh, is it the work? I mean I know I've not been around so much, but at least I'm almost finished with this stuff. I told you there's gonna be a few... I know, I know. Uh... I understand. It's just... I don't actually know what it is and that's the problem. I can't fix what I don't know... Well, that's fucking great, isn't it? So, you don't know what's wrong. You don't communicate to me what's wrong. Is it... I'm trying to communicate to you right now and is this how you're gonna behave? Yeah, yeah, well, what is it this time, Lisa? - Your depression? - I'm not depressed. Uh, you're unfulfilled again, because we know what happens when you're unfulfilled. We've been there, I dealt with that. But that's not enough. - I'm sorry. - D... No, it's... I'm sorry, I'm sorry that... Uh. I'm sorry. I don't feel anything anymore. It's like I'm just numb. That's the worst part of it. I can't even pinpoint why and I think some time apart would be really beneficial. Get some clarity, some space. - Detective Paterson. - Mr. Spann? - Yeah. - All right. - Any uh, news about your wife? - No. It's... It's an hour and a half now. I... I haven't seen her. I... I went to her parents' house in Emerson and she didn't show up there either. Why would you go there? Well, that's where I was takin' her. I thought maybe she... She would go by there. But we asked you to stay here, 'cause she could have come back here. Look, I'm clutchin' the straws here. I... I don't really know what the protocol is for a missing wife. So yeah, I took action and I went lookin' for her. - All right, uh... - I don't know what the... What are her parents' names? Uh, Anna and Barry Adams. Oh, the Adams. I know the Adams a little bit. Good people. Yeah, the good people, yeah. Did she um, leave behind any personal belongings? - A purse? - Yeah, yeah. - I found her purse in the car. - Okay. And I have her computer as well. Okay, well, hold on to that. Let me just look at this. You have her phone, do you, huh? No, I think she had her phone. I... I... I tried Find My Phone, but it must be off. All right. Let's head inside. Oscar. Detective. Uh, what you need? Coffee? No, no, I need the uh, camera footage from the surveillance. Uh, the camera's been busted a couple weeks. I got a guy comin' out, but they keep sayin' they comin' out. Nobody showed up yet. Well, this man says his wife is missing. You've been sitting here all day. - Did you see anybody? - I... I didn't seen a thing. Shoot. All right, listen, I'ma head back to the station, - issue out an APB. - Yeah. You wanna come with me? I can take a full statement. No, I think I... I'm gonna stay here. - Just in case she shows up. - All right. You mind if I... computer. Do you know what's the code? No, I... I... She didn't give it to me. Uh, don't worry. I got one of them whizz kids down there. He can crack anything. So what I just... Do I still hang out front? Yeah, like I said, just be reachable. Okay. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. Hey, Oscar, yeah? - Uh, back again, huh? - Yeah. Um, you said the camera's not workin'. Yeah, I already told you, it's fuckin' busted. Yeah, you said it to me, you said it to the detective. - It's 'cause it's busted. - Right. See, I know a thing about these uh, cameras. I've worked quite a few and uh, that's live. It's workin'. No, it must... uh, maybe there's a battery in there - or something... - What are you playin' on? What are you talking about? What are you playin' on? What's goin' on here? Buddy, I got no video here, okay? Yeah, you got no screen. Yeah, what do you want from me? You might have no feed, but that's recording. Uh, we mind our own fuckin' business here, all right, man? Did you say you mind your own fuckin' business? Yeah, get the fuck out of here. We're talkin' about my fuckin' wife here. - Well, not my problem. - Uh, really? - That's how you're gonna be? - Not my problem. Get the fuck out. Okay, I'm gonna need to look at this footage, man. Hey. Hey, what the fuck you doin'? You won't mind if I hav a look. - Hey, nobody back here. - You won't have a problem. Get the f... hey! Get the fuck... Filthy, little motherfucker. What the fuck are you playin' at? Listen! What the... What's the fuckin' matter with you? - You run the fuckin' place! - I'm kidding. Man, okay, okay! - It's right there. - Thank you! Piece of shit. Fuck! What the fuck is going on here? Hi there. Um, I'm here to see uh, Detective Paterson. Paterson. Yo. We got uh, Mr. Spann here. - Hey. - Hey. He's got the CCTV. I thought it was broken. Yeah, so did I. Oscar gave it to me. That damn Oscar. Let's go plug it in. Hey, Mike! Heads up, incoming. One second. Your man Oscar is connected with this, by the way. -Okay. All right -I'm just... I took it out around 11:30, so you gotta go back to like 10 or 9:55 or something. Back more, just go... Go back some more. - Back up a little bit. - Got it. Back up a little bit. A couple of minutes. So, that... would... that's it? No, no. That's... that's not her. No, you gotta go... Go back some more. There she... there... That's her comin' out. All right, who's that man? I don't... I don't know who that is. I... I... He seems to know who your wife is. I've never seen him in my life. Oh, this fuckin' truck. Well... Come on. Come on, move it. Okay, wait, wait, he... he... He has her. He's have to taken her. - All right, all right. - That's... that's your man. We'll have some guys look into it, all right? - Anderson, why don't you go... - Can you go back in on him? Track down Oscar, all right? Yeah. I bet he knows who this guy is. - Thank you. - All right, thank you. All right, in the meantime, you mind if we go in another room, I ask you a few questions in private? - Yeah, sure, let's do it. - All right. Follow me. Come on in, have a seat. Uh, some water? Coffee or anything? No, I'm good. So, you sure you don't know who that man is? No, I've never seen him before in my life. Uh, no. Okay, no, it's... it's okay. I mean he just seemed to uh, have a... Be pretty familiar with your wife. - Th... that's all. - I don't know. I mean uh, doesn't look like the kinda person that Lisa would be friends with. - Okay. - I... I know her pretty well. All right. So Lisa's from her, she's got friends from here. Do you... Do you know any of them? No, I don't really know any of her friends. She... she didn't really talk about her high school. That's unusual. So you were um, on your way to Lisa's folks' house, right? Uh, Adams, in Emerson? Yeah. Like I said, I was takin' her there to drop her off, yeah. You know, I... I have to ask you um... how's your marriage? Where are we going with this? I don't... I don't... We... we... we were... We're going through a rough time. Oh, so it was gonna be a... A separation? No, it's not a separation. She just said she needed a bit of a break, that's all. So not a divorce? No, not... I don't get the relevance of this. Do you and your wife um... - You guys fight? - No. No, there's just been some tension. We don't fight, we don't scream, we don't shout. So did you have a fight on the way here? No, we did not have a fight in the way here. Okay. So, you told me that your wife may have walked home from the... From the station, right? I mean so why would she... I didn't know, detec... I didn't know. Why do you think she would go there without you? That mean if she did, it would imply maybe you had an argument. Yeah, it was a mistake, it didn't make sense. I didn't know what to do. But she... why would she do that if you guys didn't have a fight? You know, I mean we always can get a little hot, heated in the car. Why are we wasting time here? Like just... Look, there's been some tension. - My wife's an amazing woman. - Okay. - Best woman I ever met. - Mm hmm. But she has a darkness inside her and sometimes... ...she withdraws. I don't know. She's been there for me through a lot of stuff and... now she's goin' through some stuff. I'm just tryin' to be there for her. Okay. Where do you live, Will? I live in Manchester, New Hampshire. And what do you do for a living? I'm a real estate developer. There's lots of money in real estate, right? - Lots of cash exchanges hands. - Yeah. A lot of unsavory characters. Yeah, there's some, but not at a gas station in Emerson. Disgruntled employees sometimes. - Disgruntled employees. - No. I... Just like you know, they don't like the way they've been treated, the way they've been paid. I'm a good boss, okay? I really don't see how that going on in Manchester is gonna have any fucking bearing in what is happening here in... You uh, do a lot of work on the road? You go some prospecting, so to speak, speculating? Looking at property, lookin' at land? Takes you away from the city a little bit? No, I don't leave so much. I work a lot, I'm away from the house a lot. Work a lot... Away from the house. But I don't leave town so much. No. All right, so now it's... what? - No, no, no. - What? What? Have you ever had an affair? There's two guys in here talkin', right? We all... we all... every... Every guy has a wandering eye, right? No, I haven't had an affair. Has your wife? Yeah. Yeah. How long ago was that? Uh, it was about... six months ago. Do you have life insurance on your wife? Yeah. How much? I don't know. A couple million. The standard, right? Well, no, I mean I... I don't know. I make cop money, I don't make development money. Okay, so I've abducted my wife and I'm gonna kill her. I... I'm gonna cash out in a huge insurance policy. That's what this is all about? Well, okay, that's what's happening. I gotta cover all the bases. No, my wife, right now, could be three fucking states away and you're sitting in here askin' me ben-fuckin'-ign questions that I've got nothing to do with what has happened to her! Something drastic has to happen here, Detective. I need your fucking help. Or should I just go and do it myself? Why would I bring you the evidence? You might be clever than most people. - I don't know. - Oh, Christ. - You're a smart man. - Yeah. Developer. Make a lot of money. Am I free to go? Anytime you want. We have your name, we have your number, we'll be in touch. Do you have a photo of your wife? Yeah, I have a photo of my wife. Okay, be right back. I mean he looks suspicious as hell, right? He seems like a little wild card. I don't know. Mm hmm. Morning, sleepyhead. - What are you makin'? - Well... Are you trying to make breakfast? Guess what I just got. What? Remember Nate's contract that I was up for? - Yeah. - The meeting I had. Mm hmm. I got the God job! - No, you didn't! - I did! Oh, my God! We got so much goin' for it. You just gotta look uh... Look, look, what we have! We have a beautiful life. I know we've been through shit, but... we worked hard for this. I mean... we've got some more gas in the tank. - Barry. Anna. - Yeah, we're in here. You guys hear anything? - Yes, no. - Yeah, yeah, right, no. - You? - Uh, the cops put out an APB. - Okay, I knew that. - Okay. All right, so listen, I found something. - I wanna show you guys. - Yeah. We got it off that CCTV camera. Okay, you know this guy? I can't really see very well from here. Anna, do you see... I can't see without my glasses. - Hold on. - Um... - You know him? - That's hard to tell from here, but it looks a little bit like... - Oh yeah, that's Knuckles. - A bit like... - Yeah. He... - That... that's Knuckles. That's our handyman. - He's done some work around. - He works for you? - No, he work... does odd jobs. - This guy looks like a creep. He's a friend of Lisa's. I mean they've known each other since school. It's none... and he... I wouldn't call him a friend of Lisa's. - They knew each other when... - Alright, g... guys, okay, okay. So just... Does she know him enough to get in a car with him? I don't know. And do you think this guy would do her any harm? Wait a minute. Can I see this? - Is that his car? - Yeah, it's his car. Yeah. - I've seen this car. - Really? I don't know. - Where did you see it? - Yes. I did. I saw... I saw it when I went up to um, Archer Grove - for the... the garage ser... - Morrison? - Yes! - Really? It was in the back. - All right. - Uh, in the hangar things. Okay, good, good, good.

You understand? Shit. Just shut up, okay? Or you and I'll both be in jail. How you doin' today, sir? Good. You know why I stopped you? Yeah, I know I was... I was speeding. A little fast. 82 on a 55.

Thank you. - Can you just uh... - Yeah. - Give me a ticket? - No. - I'm uh... - You just step over there. Whose bags are these? My wife's. That's a lot of bags. Yeah, she likes her clothes. Where's your wife? Manchester. Do you mind poppin' the trunk please? Sure. Hey, stop! Stop right there! Dispatch, this is 5-7. I need a 20. Repeat, the 20. Detective? Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I appreciate you guys takin' the time. I just have to ask you a few questions. Absolutely. Do you know a guy named "Clint"? Um, yeah, it was the man Lisa was seeing. It was... it was briefly. - Yeah. - It was like months ago. Yeah, that's what I figured. Um, do you think your son-in-law was straying? No. No, that comes straight from Lisa. He had nothing to do with that. We bypassed her password and we saw the last three emails came from this Clint guy. - Right. - He kept asking to see her. And did she answer his emails? Not once. Are you still seeing Clint? Lisa: No. No, that was one night. I'm... I'm alone, mom, and that is exactly what I want for the time being. Yeah, you mean... You wanna be able to do what you wanna be able to do again. So you have your break, you have your fun, and I'll just go with it. He must be mad at you. He's not really the type to get mad and you know that. Sweetheart, I'm sorry I don't buy that. Fuck. Fuck! We contacted Boston PD, that's where Clint lives now, and uh, we had some... Some tech people search all of his electronics to see if he had hired anyone. They did a thorough search and it came up unsuccessful. Now um, Knuckles knew what Lisa looked like, because he saw the... The pictures in your place. Is that right? Well, I mean he knew her when they were kids, - they went to school together. - Right. Okay. And you said you saw Knuckles' car at the Morrison's, right? Yes, I drove by there a couple of weeks ago and I saw it there. And then I... I do remember seeing it another time. I just... I don't recall exactly when that was. Doesn't matter, I was there an hour ago. - And? - And? His trailer's empty. Well, can you send a chopper, survey the area? I mean they... you can't let them disappear like that. There's a suspect on the run. No, there is not. No, no, you... Well, how do you mean? Well, suspect of what? In all logic, Lisa should be here now. She is not. That is all we know at this junction. That, and she bumped into your trusted handyman at the gas station. Technically, there's no crime. Hey! You lookin' to get shot? No. Then why the fuck you touchin' it? I don't know... I just uh, thought... I don't know. What are you doin' here? I'm lookin' for uh, lookin' for Frank. Frank? Yeah, Frank. Who sent you? Frank's a friend of mine. I know him from Knuckles. Knuckles. How do you Knuckles? Does it fuckin' matter? I'm askin' a question. Yeah, it fuckin' matters. Well, he's a friend of mine. He works for my family. He introduced me to Frank. I'm here to do some business with him. All right? Where you coming from? Coming from Emerson. Fuck you. Where's your car? Dude, it's crazy. My car broke down like a couple of miles back down the road, so I'm fuckin' late. You walkin' through those woods? Yeah, I'm walkin' through the woods and Frank's waitin' for me. So, you wanna let me get on my way? Frank didn't tell me anyone's comin' this way. Well, 'cause Frank didn't fuckin' know I'd be runnin' through the fuckin' woods. I'm supposed to be drivin' there. Calm down, give me a second. Hey, Frank. Frank, you copy? You say your car broke down? Yeah, a couple of miles of back. Gave me a workout. Yeah, no fucking kidding. Frank, you copy? You know what? Can we stop fuckin' wasting time, eh? - You want... - Hey. I'm just doin' my fucking job. Fuck's sake, man. You know what? I'll fuckin' go. The phone not gonna work out here. Oh, fuck. I can't believe it. You don't think I would have fuckin' called him? You know what? Enough of this shit. How about the worst fucking day? Fucking car's broken down, now you're stoppin' me. Why don't you explain to Frank why this didn't happen, all right? Can't wait to see what happens there. I'm fuckin' out. All right, hold the fuck up! Keep walkin' down that way. All right. Thanks. You better not be fuckin' me. Fuck you, motherfucker! - Uh, no. - Cool down, hey! - No. - Fuck you, man. Get out of here. Oh, oh. Leave this. Is the truck fixed yet? Yeah, man, the truck's all good. Larry Barry. Hey, yo, get back to work. This is the second time I asked you, man. Fuck. And so he just ran off into the woods? Yes, but we're in the process of setting up a perimeter. All right, thank you. Sergeant! What the... Come, Oscar. Hey! Yo, Oscar. Fuck. ...right back. All right, I'll be right back. Hey, clean this shit up. All right. Yeah, yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm... Get in it. Hey, man, I told Robert about that. - Give me a minute with him. - Mm hmm. Pete Daniels. That's your real name? - Unemployed? - Fuck you, man. I fuckin' worked. Just... Recently? Yeah, I fuckin' worked recently. Where? Wherever fuckin' pays me, man. Uh, you know, put up a fence, pull a fuckin' post, demo work. And sometimes you kidnap women and hold 'em for ransom, right? Why are you fuckin'... Why are you grilling me like this man? I'm the one that got attacked, and tied up, and thrown in a fucking car! Why am I the fuckin' bad guy? Here's what I'm gonna do for you. You tell me where Lisa is and I'll walk in the court and I'll tell them how cooperative you've been. I'll sing your praises to the rooftops. And I bet if Will gets his wife back and the Adams get their daughter back, I can convince them not to press charges. Fuck you, man, I ain't no stupid. I know you can't promise me shit. I'm just telling you what I may be able to do to help you out. How did you get her into your car? Who said I fuckin' did, huh? You didn't? I don't recall. You're on footage talking to Lisa, but you forgot. Hey, uh, excuse me. Lisa. Lisa Adams! - Pete, hi. - Knuckles. - Right, hi, how are you? - I'm good. How're you? I know... I... I heard you were coming back. - Yeah. Yeah, that's... - Yeah. I... I'm doin' some work uh, uh, up at um, at... at your... Your parents' house on the room. - Oh, that's you! Okay. - Yeah, yeah. - They're so happy with it. - Oh yeah. - I can't wait to see it. - Good. Are you... are you... Are you headin' there right now? - Yeah. Yeah. - Are you? Could you do me a favor? Could you uh, bring an invoice that I got? Sure. Just a little something, drop off for your pops. - Okay. - Real quick. - Yeah, no problem. - Who you here with? - Oh, my husband. - Oh. Yeah. You look really great, by the way. - Thanks, thanks. - Yeah. You have to tell your mom I said "hi." I haven't seen her for uh... Shut the fuck up. Get in the fuckin' car. Don't be stupid, just get in. Get in the fuckin' car. You're on tape talking to her right before she disappeared and no one's seen her alive since. Yeah, so I fuckin' talked to her, man. Big fuckin' deal, all right? I knew her. I was workin' at her fuckin' parents' house. - You just keep an eye on him. - Damn, man. Close to maybe two days, I gotta fix the shit. I think it's inside the kitchen. Inside. You got the key? I don't have the key, man. Shit. Okay, I'll go back to the house and get the key. - Whoa, whoa. - Oh, shit. - The hell, man? - Watch your hands. - Watch your hands. - All right. - Back up. - Yeah, calm down, man. - Back up. - Whoa, whoa! - Hey. - What the fuck? Just tell me where she is, okay? - Where who is? - My wife. Lisa! Tell me where Lisa is. I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. Calm down, man. Be easy. Please, please. Tell me, all right? I don't care what you guys are doin' here, I just wanna know where she is and I will get out of here. No police, no nothing, but just tell me where she fuckin' is! Know what we do here? We don't have... So, please tell me. I just want my wife back. - Just put the gun down, bro. - Knuckles told me! I know who you are! Please. Please just tell me where she is. I don't know any Knuckles, man. Fuck. Okay, open that door, let me see what's inside. - You wanna see what's in here? - I swear to God, I will shoot you in the fuckin' face. All right. Open the door, Larry. All right, calm down, man. All right. Let me see what's in there. - Easy with that, man. - Open the door. Let him take a look. Okay. - Good, man. - Shut the fuck up. Easy. Easy. I'm good, I'm good. Fuck. Shit. Fuck with me, you fucking... You're fucked up now, dude! I got you! You're boxed in! Where are you gonna go? Shit. Just tell me w... Fuck! Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Come on! Fuck! Go on. Fuck off. Hey, you guys, go. Go home. I'm sorry, Will. Can you please just understand this? I don't wanna be like this I don't wanna resent you and I don't want you to resent me. - You're my best friend. - Oh. You're my favorite human. - What? - Yeah. Out of all the humans, you're my favorite. I love you, babe. Hey, get out of here! Go. Go, get lost. Lisa? You must be the dumbest motherfucker alive. You kidnapped a woman in broad daylight and think nobody saw that shit? You're doin' life! You're doin' life. Lisa! So, tell me where she is. Lisa! Lisa? I'm gonna make you feel so good. J... just tell me where she is. - Where is she? - She's fuckin' dead, man. She's fuckin' dead. You killed her? Hey. What the fuck? Fuck. I'm right in knowin' I'd see you here. Yeah, everybody does a little meth, right? I mean that's easy fuckin' money. All right, what about kidnappin', huh? - Is that good money? - Fuck that. - I didn't kidnap anybody. - You're so full of shit. You're not fuckin' kill me? What are you gonna do? You're gonna fuckin' kill me, huh? You might wanna ask Frank that. Eh? You're not a fucking killer either. All right, put the gun down. Lower it. You put the fucking gun down! You put it down! All right. Okay, talk to me. I think it's fucking crazy you care so much about your wife when she's gettin' ready to leave your ass. I mean, but that's divorce for you, though, right? It's like gettin' fucked twice. How you know about the divorce, huh? If you're not involved in the kidnappin'? Knuckles. Yeah, Knuckles. Listen, that's not the fucking point. The point is that I know where the fuck she is. All right, where is she? Tell me where she is! She alive? - Is she alive? - 20,000. Okay, 20,000 and I will fuckin' tell you... - You're a lying piece of shit. - Everything you need to know. I don't believe you! Tell me where she is. Show me her! Hey, prove it! Huh? It's her fuckin' phone, right? Right, that's her phone, right? That's her phone, right? - Yeah. - You prick! - Okay. - You fiuckin' prick. Okay, now we're talkin', right? - Yeah. - Yeah, now we're talkin'. - Yeah, now we're talkin'. - You think I didn't see her? I saw her when she bought that bottle of water. Yeah, I saw her. Come on. $20,000 and I will tell you. Huh? All right, I'll give you 20,000. Oh, my ball's in your court. - I'll give you the money. - Okay. Okay, how am I gonna get the money? - How am I gonna get the money? - I'm gonna go... No, fuck that! I want the money right now! 20,000 and I will get you... I'll give you the money, just get me Lisa. - I wanna see her. - I'm coming with you. - I'm coming with you! - You're not comin' with me! I'm coming with you! I think you're gonna call the cops! Let me see her! Let me see my fuckin' wife! And how do you know she's dead? How do you know she's dead? - How do you know she's dead? - Because I dug the fucking hole! A couple of weeks ago, I was... I was just talking shit with Frank. I was just fuckin' around about how this... This fuckin' girl I knew was coming back. She married this fuckin' rich dude and we could get a shit ton of money if we snatched her, you know? He'd wanna get her back, you know? I wasn't fuckin' thinkin' straight. It was fuckin' stupid, man. I saw her at the fucking gas station. I just fuckin' snatched her. And then I... I took her to Frank. I took her to Frank. He got so fuckin' mad, man. He was so fuckin' pissed off that I took her there, 'cause he knew... he knew there were fuckin' cameras. That they fuckin' saw me. And Frank wouldn't let me leave with her alive. He said I had to dig a fucking hole and put her in it. I was diggin' the hole, but I knew Frank was gonna put me in it, too, so I fuckin' ran. I didn't wanna hurt her. Where's the hole? - Where is the fucking hole? - At Frank's house. Up in Beckley. I swear to God, I just wanted the fuckin' money. Jesus, fucking. Hey, turn that off. Drivin' in circles, huh? We found Knuckles in your trunk. I'm under arrest? Stay put. Hmm. Lisa? Lisa! Lisa? What the fuck. Okay, I'm comin'. Lisa. Oh shit, baby. What the fuck? It's okay. It's okay. Oh, it's okay, baby. I got you. It's okay. You're okay, see. It's okay, it's okay. Will, please, get me out of here please. Okay, come. - I got you. - Okay. As I figured, couldn't stand the guilt. Knuckles signed the confession, but he still blames everything on Frank, by the way. But who the fuck knows? I think Oscar caught him in the act and tried to push himself into the ransom money. Wow. Look at some real salts of the earth there, huh? One could say that. By the way uh, we inspected some of the remains. Not all of them died in the explosions, there were some shots exchanged. I said to myself, "Hey, you lived by the sword." - Thank you. - Take care of yourself. Can you um, give us a minute? - Hi. - Hey. - Good? - Yeah. Come with me. Yeah.
