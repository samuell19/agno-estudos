I can understand the situation Ask him to eat and go See, for a fresh Passport application you can leave the spouse column empty or put any name But when it comes to removing a name from a passport the rules are limitless how about if I apply for a new passport under lost passport? even so then, they will ask for the same old records to prepare a new passport again and that would lead to the same girl's name, again Alright, how about we start with a clean slate!? Fresh application. 'Bachelor' Well, any details would do. But your face... Your biometrics, eye color and all that data is in their database Just go and come clean to your master!? Mr. Nesan... I am trying to do all this to save my face in front of that big hearted master Won't he worry that you are not trustworthy anymore since you casually lied about a wife for a job? Nesan! It sounds like a cow slurping! Can you not!? Gandhi.. There's a guy in the passport office I know Yes, what do you want? Sir, I need to remove my wife's name from the passport Kaarmeghakuzhali... - Have you removed your wife? -Sir? - Divorce...? Divorce?? Sir, I am single Single?? How come you have a wife's name in the passport? According to IPC 1967 Indian Passport Act .... This is a huge crime! Sir! I didn't try to do any fraud We were trying to go to London on a tourist visa. They asked me to put a random name for wife section, so I did - Didn't Kumar sir tell you this - Nope, he didn't tell me all this If I remove your wife's name form here, they will remove me from this office There, you see that guy... - Who's that, sir? - newly joined regional Passport Officer If you had told him what you just told me..you're dead! Dead?? - eaten alive! Sir.. any other ways? If you go by the government procedures, no. You guys go outside. Find this chap Hariharasudhan Tell him I sent you. He'll show you another procedure - What would Pandi be doing? - Haha, he will be teaching a white girl English Why, you worried for him? He will swallow London. Last person to be worried about Hello...?...Cheap fellow, giving missed call! - Gandhi ... - Hariharasudhan? ... - I was that missed call Hello sir Right, so you want your father's name removed from the passport? Not my fathers... my wife's ... Remove wife's name? planning for next marriage? No. Made a mistake putting a girls name while applying for tourist visa. Now want it removed. Didn't he tell you? He didn't say anything. Such crooked cases he will shove at me This not like the normal ones that can be dealt with an affidavit I know a senior lawyer. Here's his number. Go meet him - Lawyer? Why? - This needs a divorce! I'm gonna go check upstairs [Judge] She wants 7000. What do you say? Your honor... he is struggling for food. How can he give 7000? He doesn't look so. How much are you drinking? See, she is asking, so now is your turn to tell us how much you can - 1500! - No your honor. He earns well. I want 7000 He is a porter! What are you even asking? - Again, they want 7000. What are your thoughts? - You rhonor, I have no income! How can you be trusted? 2000, your honor? - Yes your honor! 2000 works! See - [judge] He is willing to give 2000... - No your honor I want 7000 Woman! He is yet to pay me fees. How can such a guy pay you 7000? Madam! Is actor Sanjay's divorce case hearing here? - What? Actor Sanjay's divorce hearing is happening here? Where? - NO , that's what I am asking Not here Hi! Visa office... interview... do you recall me? Can you give a soundbyte now? Madam, we are waiting downstairs Sir, 5 mins!....2 mins!!! [Judge] This is going nowhere... Attorney! Its down to you guys sorting it out and agreeing to a settlement amount Sir, the party is waiting here This is Gandhi.. this is Nesan.. Sir is S. Mahamuni Chandrasekharan - Sorry got a bit late. - Its ok sir Shall we talk as we walk? So what do you want? - Sorry got a bit late. - Its ok sir Shall we talk as we walk? So what do you want? What I do for you? - I need an urgent divorce, sir. - Urgent? Uh.. ok.. Are you two separating or you want a mutual divorce? Anything is ok, sir. I just need it soon Anything? huh. okay. Any problems from your wife? - No sir, she is not there. - She died? No no. I am actually single - Single?? Well, that means we have to stop walking. It is already hell to get a married man divorce and here you are .. 'single' There have been 4487 divorces granted last year alone some are maintenance cases But your case... this is a first.. very tough - Sir, its not that tough. There's an easy solution - How? Sir. Let's get a marriage certificate made first from the registrar's office Then you can bring it under 13B mutual. I can apply for an affidavit in the girl's name Well, even if you do that, they'll check for original proof certificates and both parties need to be physically present for first hearing This will be a mutual. Appearance can be avoided - It's doable! - Okay As a senior advocate, I don't usually take such cases. This time, just for you There's a way. Find some girl with the same name and get their ID proof - What!? Where do we go find a Kaarmeghakuzhali? - No other go. Try to do this first Have rummaged through Facebook and all social media. There is no kaarmegham... neither is kuzhali. neither separate nor together Sis... Chutney! Pour in the centre Shall we search on matrimony sites? Right, as if you are bride hunting for me You should check the ladies college side Sir, it's wrong to eavesdrop. And here you are with free advise too. Eat your food Hey here's a photo! Surely this old lady would not be alive... even if she was alive She can put some make up and be brought to court Reason for divorce: age difference! But what if they ask how you didn't know this at the time of marriage? That's the only problem Wash your hands! And shut your mouth! Such useless ideas... Oh shit.. this lady She was at the embassy the other day. And today at the court too. And now TV. [..reporting for Tamil News with cameraman Sukumaran; Kaarmeghakuzhali] WHAT!? Tamil News channel!

You are from a Tamil channel, right? Then ask in Tamil! Ok sir, we shall continue in Tamil Respected Sir, please don't misunderstand me, but have you paid attention to how your daughter dresses? My daughter dresses decently My daughters have had an upbringing full of Tamil culture! Oh yeah? Just a minute, sir Have you seen her whatsapp picture? This is not my daughter! This is photoshop!

Telecast twice last week too Madan! I have a sensational news for you Scared to send to other channels. - Really? - Ok, what is it? - just a minute Gandhi! Come here This is my friend Gandhi. We both came here from Sri Lanka Poor chap... he is a mute He is asking 'how are you?' Madam, shall we speak in detail some place? Ok, tell me Have you heard of the '83 riots? - Yes Gandhi lost his entire family in those riots Do they name people Gandhi in Sri Lanka? Of course. We have a Gandhi in our text books too There are many such Sri Lankan Gandhis in Tamil Nadu here We just found out that Gandhi's mother and sister are actually alive! They are in London He's applied for visa to go to London But they rejected him But he didn't lose heart He joined a drama school In a short time, got promoted to manager - Now he has a chance to go to London. - Then, why hasn't he gone yet? There is a small problem In the spouse column of his passport, there is a girl's name What do you want from me? Well, so the thing is, they told at the passport office to get divorce from a person with same name and remove the name from passport How can a woman give you strangers her documents? Won't it cause her trouble? - No no! We just need the photocopy of the documents. Nothing will happen to her So then she is broad minded? not concerned with what the society thinks... and someone who has a helping tendency, right? you'll not find a woman like that Tsk... sir! Sounds like a donkey slurping away at the coffee! Please drink silently Well, what's this got to do with me? Hey, take the passport out 'K-A-R-M-E-G-H-A-K-U-Z-H-A-L-I" Thank me. -Why? - For not slapping you two! Idiots! Total time waste! Interval Sir, we both barely made it out of there without a slap! Wait.. Sir, that girl is short tempered Is it? She won't publish all this in news I hope - No sir, she is a nice girl. - If she was nice, she should have helped you - No Sir, she.. [cop] - Sir, do you have a change for 500 rupees? - I have not seen any change... - Do you have? [Nesan plays dumb] - No sir Sir, check the wine shop nearby! You'll get the short changes Cops never have the need to return any short change. Is he even a real cop? By the way, why did you become mute on seeing the cop? I don't have a passport, sir. If they catch me, its camp. And you, why are you playing dumb before that girl? He told her I am a Sri Lankan. If I start speaking, she will get to know from my Tamil Oh. All these are your ideas? Basically, if a problem comes, go mute. - Sir, is there any other way? - Nope, she is your only option She was coming from a heated press meet You should've picked a different time Sir, if you find her alone, just fall at her feet Don't feel ashamed To get your work done, there is no shame in falling at someone's feet That was a super idea.. with the petrol "Please do us a favor" - Who are they? - No, they looked like my wife and daughter. But no. Poor thing they got scared Gandhi! - Sir? - Where's your passport? - Sir... I lost it What is this? How can Gandhi's passport go missing? Sir, you apply for the visa.

Didn't you come here because you can't make a living in your hometown? And look at you how you are treating someone who is struggling to make a living. Throwing them out You there! I am paying you the rent! Whats with the additional 8 rupees electricity bill? The wiring needs to be pulled up from ground floor! Who will pay for that! If you want to rent out a place its your job to fix that wiring! Fix a fan, a bulb, and also a motor to pump the water! All these should be part of a house! These are the things one pays rent for, you idiot Hey! How can you talk like this to my husband? And you, why are you standing like a statue?? We haven't come here because we are homeless...

No, I need to remove wife's name from my passport - Simple... - I am not married Oho.. so this is that category Its very simple. First get a divorce done with her name I have a friend who is a lawyer at the family court. Go meet him and... All tried already. Thanks Boss wait wait! If this idea didn't work, I can give other ideas! If you go in there now, they will keep shuttling you from one table to another Then your work will never get done in time oh.. go on, talk - Where are you? - I am at the passport office - Ok, stay there. I will see you shortly. - What? - I am coming I've got the idea! First go to your area police station and file a complaint for missing wife - Today? - Yes Then... A friend's friend I know works at the mortuary We can go to him and buy an unclaimed corpse of a 25 year old woman Then we ready a fake ID card with your wife's name Stuff the ID with the corpse and throw it into the river - then? - Next morning you'll get a call from the area station Saying that a dead 25 year old woman's body has been found asking you to come identify You just have to go and act and cry and you can get a death certificate confirming it is your wife! Once we have that, then all this is nothing! How much do you charge for this service? Uh.. I can't do all this alone. This requires teamwork Let me go discuss with the others inside Stay here, don't go anywhere! I'll be right back Another important thing! There are many fraud brokers loitering around here. Whoever comes and asks, say nothing! - Come let's go home. - Why? Mom knows everything Okk. Why do I have to come? My mom is suspecting me! She thinks I had actually married you and that I am trying to divorce you now! She's torturing me asking me not to throw away my life with you Uh.. what happened to that marriage alliance the other day? That was a waste. Didn't work out You just come and tell her the truth. That will be good for you Give me 5 mins Hey! Are you trying to escape? please wait, I will be back Excuse me, sir! Hello, sir. - Tell me There is a mistake in my passport I want to rectify - Go to counter 4. - No,sir I want to speak with you Tell I tried to go to London using a tourist visa , to settle abroad A broker told me that married people get visa easily So I put a girl's name in the wife section Visa got rejected. So I found a job here. What did you do then? I listened to many people and ideas and tried to get a divorce and then a court case and all that. Nothing worked Just wasted money Now you want that girl's name removed? - yes sir Our people have gotten used to getting everything done through shortcut - How much did you spend? - Quite some money, sir How many boards have we put out there to be beware of brokers? Aren't you educated? Why do you think the government has made such a big office with all of us employees here? At the end you will have to come here only. Why didn't you do this at first!? Sorry sir Where's your passport? You are truly single, right? I swear, sir Go give this to the help desk You'll get a form. Fill it and pay the fine You will get a new passport with name removed, within 15 days Ok sir How much is the fine? Around 1300 rupees - That's it, sir? - Government will only charge so much - You may go. - Thank you sir Sir himself signed?? Oh you went directly to him - Did he say something? - No It is a good thing you went and saw him directly Unnecessarily why go through so many middlemen Each one will tell one thing. And you will keep going round in circles I would have told this to you that day itself. What if you misunderstood... We are all so scared of him. But you are so brave! Fill this form up, and sign it Sir, just a minute. Please give me my passport - Why? - Just for 5 mins. I will be back Ok lets go I need to ask you something before that What is it? Shall we both get married? Why? Because I like you a lot They told the name can never be removed from the passport? No Passport officer himself has approved a change. Oh, this is what you have been going through so much for. You can finally do it, right? What if this is another story you are spinning? How do I trust you? From whatever has happened so far, I don't know what you have taken me for I won't cheat you now onwards I won't lie to you...I like you a lot. If you are okay, we can go talk to your mom about our marriage Shall we? Okay. Let's go Hello ma'am Karmeghakuzhali, what have you decided? Uh, we have decided to live together Then why did you fight and walk out from the counselling session? That was just anger at that time, ma'am Now you don't find his handicap a problem? He was lying back then. Now he isn't like that. He is under my control I love him You guys are all so young! That is why we ask you to go for a 6 month counselling Ma'am it was a genuine help I decided to give so that these youngsters have a good life Right. You may go Come, lets go What happened?

Nothing like that sir Such a good guy. I wanted to make him my son-in-law Its ok, you are also like a daughter to me You should have told me before, I would've applied for her visa too If he would have told you everything then, he himself would've had to sit out Oh yes If I had known he was a fraud... Not only would I have fired him, but handed over to cops too - master, I think it is time for the flight - Oh yes, we should leave Hey guys, assemble everyone Bye
