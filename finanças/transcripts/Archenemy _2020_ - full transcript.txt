My city was named Chromium. It had a halo. But it was full of devils. I could soar through the cosmos, gathering light from my city, but there was always someone who wanted to destroy me just because I could fly. My archenemy, Cleo Vantrik. On that day, she was going to destroy the city, kill everyone, annihilate all flesh. She called it the Void Machine. I stopped her. But it was the last thing I ever did. I punched through the molecules to create a vortex. I detonated it in the silence between space and time. And I grabbed onto any reality that I could. This one. I smashed my way to this bullshit reality to save Chromium. You saved the fucking world. I did. That one, anyway. You still got them superpowers? The power to drink a fifth of whiskey and not pay it. Hey, he paid for my drink. He gets the story. I sure do. How about another one? To Chromium. To Chromium. 15 over here, man. Best on the block. Here. Hey, good looking, man. I'll see you soon. I'll be here. Yo. Bro, show me the watches. Show me the watches, bro. Come on, dawg. Back up, bro. - I'm not fucking around. - Street like a thug. Bro, don't call me a thug, first of all. Back up, bro. It's gonna go... It's gonna go crazy on Trendible, son. - Come on, bro. - Yo, what you selling? - Get out my... - What you selling? Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you, man? - Look, sorry. - You broke my phone. Ain't nobody buying your shit anyways, man. Buying my shit? You... You tripping. What are you talking about? Hey, Melissa. It's Hamster. I want to do stories for you guys. Look, I have a lot of creatives. Everyone's a creator, love. You don't have anyone here who's from my world. Where are you from? I'm from crazy town. I'm from the streets. I can show you Hamster's world. - Hamster's world? - Yeah. Alright. Alright, show me. Easy. Check this dude out. Who's that? He's a local drug dealer. I report on the grit, the human story from the inside. This majestic bitch is 12 years old, and she's already playing the pan flute. - What else you got? - Okay, what else you want? I'm Hamster, Melissa. I can dig it up. I can make it happen. I mean, come on, look around you. Look at the damn cat with the... What is that? Laser cats? That shit ain't real. This is not the world in here. I think Trendible's 50 million unique visitors per day would say otherwise there, Hamster. Oh, please, I can get you 15 million more viewers. Really? And I can show you the real city. Hamster's city. Can you see it in your mind right now? You see it? Tell me can you see it? Alright, alright. We'll set you up with a temporary creator account. Show me something cool. And if it works, we'll hire you. Really? Really. Really? Okay. Okay. Hey, look, see, now you in Hamster's world now. Okay. I won't disappoint you. I promise. I will shake you up. Splash! Every story is coming to you. Alright. O-74. O-74. O-63. O-63. Go ahead. I'm not fucking stupid. Okay? A bitch can't have personal protection? Okay, maybe when I'm mute, bare-handed killer like your crazy ass, I won't have to weaponize. Indigo, my little blue raspberry. How's business? Business needs to get better. Here's what I'm thinking. I think we start dealing to the little ones. The preschoolers. The fucking sippy cup crowd. They're old enough to download porn onto their iPads. I think they're old enough to get high. What do you say, huh? Throw on a little princess outfit, get on the corner. I'm fucking joking. Lighten up. Did I ever tell you that I wanted to be a musician when I was younger? - No. - No? Yeah, I wanted to be a singer, actually. Yeah. I even got a gig once. Worked out five little songs. Puked after two. Got paid 7 bucks. I figured there's got to be a better way to make a living. So now, when I want to hear people clap, I just say clap. They can never say you didn't crack the code, huh? I crack fucking skulls, too. You wanted to see me about something? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. I make money for you now. Yes? But I want to make you even more money. I was thinking I can carve out larger parts of the neighborhood. I can oversee people. Who are you going to oversee, huh? The fucking ice cream man? They are slacking on those fucking blocks. They are just waiting for the money to fall from the sky. Not me. See, I want to make it rain. You give me more blocks, I'll turn them around. We should be expanding. We should be going viral with it. - Viral. - Mm-hmm. - You want to go viral? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. You know, I've always liked you. You work hard. Fucking smart. I'll tell you what. I'd like to try you out on something. Now, this may surprise you, but I've got a boss, too, and the boss likes to know that things run smoothly around here. I got to make sure things are in tip-top shape. I want you start with Jimmy Krieg. - You know Jimmy Krieg? - Yeah, I've seen him around. He's a player, whatever. Don't act all fuckin blasé. I think you know as well as I do the Jimmy Krieg is a high roller and a fucking psychopath. I didn't ask for a job at the team biscuit shop. Go to Krieg. He's got money of mine. Or at least he fucking better. You pick up the money, bring it back to me. But I want him to trust you and I want you to report back to me does he say anything weird? I appreciate the opportunity. I've always been good to you, right? ♪ I can't jump high but I hear all the notes ♪ To you and your family. Guess who's Trendible's newest star reporter. - Yo. - What? Where the fuck you been, Hams? Making moves, trying to get paid. Don't make moves, okay? I make moves. You keep safe while I make them, okay? Come on, man. And you cracked your phone. You're so clumsy, kooky kid. I know, okay? Look, just give it back. It's okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you sharing photos of drug dealers? - He's just my boy. - Can you imagine what would happen if this gets back to the Manager? It's just stories, Indy. I'm trying to put something out there. But you wouldn't know shit about that. So you must think that I like this shit... acting hard, dealing with these people. No. Listen to me. I'm trying to get you to college like Dad wanted, and then I'm out of this hell game. I dropped out of high school. Now, how you expect to put me in a college? Do you not watch the news? It's a fucking scam. You give them enough money and they let your ass in. You're getting college scam money? - Yeah. - This is my life. Life ain't no crime reporter bullshit, because that's dangerous. A lot of people want to keep a low profile. I know I do. A woman who wants to keep a low profile doesn't wear her hair that color. I can't help that I'm a sugar plum fairy interstellar princess. That's who I am. And this is who I am. Dad was a storyteller. You remember that shit? He would come up with crazy stuff to tell us. I wish I could remember. He had this one ongoing saga about these two ravens that would fly around the world, picking up tiny gold chains out of jewelry boxes because they were building a golden nest. Maybe that's where you get it from. See, it's in our blood. We're fucking storytellers. - Okay, Shakespeare. - You... You just did it. - Come on. - Whatever, whatever. I made you something. It's a recipe I cooked up because I love keeping my little brother alive. Okay. That looks... What? What is that? Spirulina balls. Superfood. It'll keep you hyped. Tell me I'm the best sister you ever had. Keep the change. Good night, amigo. I can see right through you. Hey, yo, uh, what'd the wall ever do to you, man? Bet it owes you money, huh? The wall is an asshole, man. Look, it deserves what's coming to it. I used to punch holes through space-time. Oh, really? Oh. - Hey! - Oh! Hey, I heard about you, man. You're the dude who says he's from another planet. You got superpowers, right? It's not a planet. It's a city. Yeah, I seen you around. You say you can fly. Come on, I just want to hear your story. I'm a writer. Listen, man, the people want to know. Hey, man. Hey. Get off the street. Are you still alive? Oh! Oh, no. Whoa, come on, man. I was trying to get you out the street. These dicks were going to run over your head. No bueno. Man, you going to be okay? Shit. We need to get you to the hospital. They don't understand my biology. You got to drink this. Need to hydrate. Max Fist. Hamster City's cosmic crusader. We don't know what he's fighting, but we know he's lit. On the streets, on the rooftops. Fist is fire. Hamster City heroes. Splash! Max? Max? Max. Who the fuck are you? I found you, man. I brought you some stuff, man. Check it out. Got some coffee, some beer. I know you like beer. Hey, I paid for that. I got some food in there, too. Twinkies. Okay. Figured you'd tell me your story if you had a snack. I guess beer's the one. You know, I used to sit on top of the highest buildings in Chromium, thousands of feet up, and look down like a god. Hell, I'd hover on the edge of a black hole and dare it to pull me in. Here, I'd crush myself against the Earth with one wrong twitch. Chromium? So that's where you're from? What are you, some kind of kid reporter? I bring it to life. Hey, you ever heard of Hunter Thompson? I don't think we had one of him. He fully dove into the worlds that he wrote about. I mean, he was crazier than the crazies he was profiling. Gonzo. Yeah, we had a guy like that. The Spider. He could beam crime scene investigation reports straight into your brain. That's what I'm talking about. That's splash-worthy. - Splash-worthy? - Yeah. I'll tell you what, you get me something to eat and some whiskey, I'll bring it to life for you. So my archenemy, Cleo Vantrik, she had a doomsday device called the Void Machine. It was going to kill everybody. And so I did the only thing that I thought was possible, which... you... Do you know anything about string theory? Okay. Uh... Shit. Alright, look, do you have any superpowers at all? You know anybody that does? Look, kid, the source of my power doesn't exist here. It's not like it's like a billion miles away. It's... It's imaginary. The square root of negative one... fucking impossible. Wait, imaginary like it's not real? Not real here. You understand me? He could fly. He could punch. He could shoot elephants out of his ass. Why you got to fill the kid's head with bullshit? Come on, man. Look, just keep his fucking glass filled. So you were super strong, but what could hurt you? They had to invent things to hurt me. Solar guns, intelligent asteroids, big fucking killer robots, whatever Cleo could come up with. Even the whiskey's weaker here. That's why I can drink so much of it. Space whiskey. So were you always like that or...? I started out normal. I worked for a task force that managed the cosmic blood and monitored cosmic events, threats we didn't know how to handle. Because of supervillains? Say super one more fucking time. O-O-Okay. But that's what you mean, right? No. You have to understand about the cosmic blood. See, it was just starting to leak in at that point. What does cosmic blood even mean? What does that... What does that mean? It's the difference between Chromium and this shit hole. The cosmic blood... It came from something called the cosmic source, which is a black hole the size of 12 billion suns hovering on the edge of my universe. It started making people weird. Weird? Ah, fuck it. You can't even understand it. This place, your... your gravity, your dirty atmosphere, it's added 15 years to my body. Imagine what it's like to wake up one day and just be old. I need you to secure the reactor. There's something right here. Fuck there's a... Get out of the source! Oh, my God. The power coursing through my molecules. Max. The Crystal Fist. It chose me so that I could help them defend Chromium. Then Cleo tried to kill everyone with the Void Machine. And I wound up here. So could you find Chromium on, like, a map of the universe or something? I didn't fly through space. Came through the membranes of reality. Same planet, different universe. This is a dimmer fucking universe. Did you guys have, like, the Grand Canyon or did you have McDonald's or something? I got to be honest, I haven't done a lot of exploring of your grim rock. Theoretically, it should all be the same up to the divergence. Okay, so if it's basically the same, right, then we should be able to find it here. Like if you could give me coordinates, we could see - if the Crystal Cave is here. - Yeah, but it's not the same. Okay, but if it was the same, we could see exactly where the Crystal Cave would be here. - There's no chance. No. - Well, then, listen, let's just pretend for a minute that it's possible. It's not fucking pretend, okay? You're recording me, but you're not listening. You don't... You're not hearing me. I wasn't trying to upset you. I am here today not because you love me but because I love you. I love Chromium, and I will never leave you. Krieg, it's Indigo. Yo, Krieg, the Manager sent me. They sent you? The Manager. - What? - The Manager sent me to pick something up from you. Oh. I thought you were here to kill me. Come in. Quick, quick, quick. - You smoke? - Nah. -Pills... - you like pills, right? - Nah. Yeah, I don't know what it is about this fucking town, but every time I'm here, I get this irresistible urge to just get fucking wasted. Yeah. Imagine growing up here, you know? - Let me tell you something. - Mm-hmm. Okay, you don't fuck with people, okay? I didn't fuck with anybody. This is not my job. I'm here to make shit go cool. - Okay? - Yeah. Alright. I'm not dying for anyone's sins, okay? I'm not dying for anyone's sins. Not here. You know, it's like... like snakes. Here's the thing about snakes. They only live within a five-mile radius of where they were born. Did you know that? Yeah. Check this out. Bam. Snakeskin boots. That way, I'm always home even when I'm out of fucking town in this shit hole. I thought you was from around here. Want some? Nah. What the fuck, a'ight? I offer you something. I offer you something in my house, and you should take it. Okay. Fuck. Now... Now here's what I don't understand, though. You said that you thought that I was from here, which means that you put thought into it. About me. Should I be worried? Relax. It's my job. - Your job. - Mm-hmm. That's my job too. My job to worry. Okay. Okay, we'll try this again. You want some? I'm good, man. Okay, well, then we're going to fucking play a game. Alright, Johnny, what do we got? Oh! No. Don't be fucking wack. Here? Here? Am I wack? No bullets. You should have seen the look on your face. Look at that. No bullets. I got you. No, no, no, no, no. Now, this, this is a bullet. And... Madame. No, man. At this point, you got to fucking do it. Or I'm gonna think this whole goddamn thing is a setup. Then I have to get angry. Bang! No. No, no, no, no, no. I want you to put it to your head and pull the fucking trigger. Come on. Oh, fuck. Fucking shit! Good fucking shit. Did you see that? God damn it. You actually did it. Girl, you are fucked... What's your name? - Indigo. - Indigo. Fuck, Indigo. Indigo, you are a fucking crazy bitch because you were just sitting here like "I'm just gonna put this gun ..." Fuck. Man. Does the kid know you're just a schizophrenic that lives under a bridge? You'll never be free of me. Never. You'll never be free of me. Never. You'll never be free of me. Like I'll never be free of you. And I'll never be free of you. That's why I'm building the Void Machine. So we can get back to who we really are. Together. She's here. Police are all over the place. Couldn't even get near it, you know? - And I just, uh... - Okay. I don't understand what you're telling me. Krieg offed himself. Mm. And you know that for a fact? Yeah. A guy dies with $300,000 of my money missing, and we assume that the cops, motherfucking law-enforcement officials, are a trustworthy source of information? Well, it's not... I got the police report right here. Police report. You got the... Give me that. Come on, let me see. Let me see. Oh, here? Right up in there. Oh. Open your mouth. What? I said open your fucking mouth! What did Indigo say? - Who? - Indigo, the nutty broad with the hair. She was supposed to go meet him. If Krieg came to town without my money, that means I got to send you guys to kill his guys. So before I do that, talk to her. See if she knows anything. Okay. Well, hello. Glad you want to visit our little nook. It'll be nice to finally meet you. Well, that's much sooner than I had expected. Is there some kind of a problem bringing you here? Of course. Who the fuck is Max Fist? Fist Fact 15... Max's Crystal Fist was stronger than a diamond. Fist Fact 57... Chromium was powered by the cosmic source. Fist Fact 23... Cleo Vantrik was the smartest person... The longest Max traveled at one time was 200... Fist Fact 100... On Chromium, Max's blood was blue. Hamster, the Max Fist posts are getting insane numbers. Word. Keep this up and we'll bring you on full-time. Hey, why don't you fight crime here? I've been through the fucking cosmic tendrils of time. Seen the universe through the prism of 11-dimensional space. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, I get what you mean, but, you know, you did punch a lot of people too. I mean, you killed all - the bad guys, man. - No, I didn't kill anyone. That was a rule. I inspired people with my strength. That's beautiful, Max. The Crystal Cave was the source of Max's power on Chromium. But there's got to be something on Earth in the same coordinates. I don't know what it is, but I know it'll be splash-worthy. Fucking shopping mall. It's a different parallel world, right? Cemented over the Crystal Cave with a fucking shopping mall. Let's just get some shovels and dig this shit up. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Sorry, I just... I just wanted you to see. It's beautiful. It's just... - What the fuck is with this car? - Asshole. Fuck you! Yo, what you gonna do with that? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get out the fucking way, man. ♪ He's a hundred, gonna break something ♪ ♪ He's a hundred, gonna break something ♪ ♪ He's a hundred, gonna break something ♪ Fuck you! Fuck you! Are you okay? Do you need water? Do you... Okay, do you need any space whiskey? Come on, man. Max Fist versus car. My man faces down a metal beast in the savage land. Now that's the heart of a hero right there. Oh, my God. I got that on video. Indigo, it's Finn. Manager sent me. Hey. Mind if we come in for a quick chat? Yeah. Cute place. Really cute. - You need anything? - No, I'm good. I like your pants. Thanks. Hey, Decker, how about this "Alice in Wonderland" thing she's got going on? Isn't it beautiful? So... So, what do you know about Krieg? I was supposed to get something from him for the Manager. But I haven't yet. Do you want something? Water, beer? You didn't have a chance? When I went to the hotel, he didn't answer. 'Cause he was dead. What? Come here. Come, come on, come over here. Don't worry. I'm not here because I think that you did anything. He killed himself. Strangest goddamn thing. Shit. And I just don't get it. You know, I mean, you live this gritty life. I don't know, like this life... ...of violence is meant to deflect away from, like, the agony of self, you know? Anyway, so I just wanted to know if you knew anything about it. You don't think he was stealing from the Manager or...? You look worried. Are you worried? It's just weird. Yeah, that's what I thought, too, you know. Weird. We're going to take off. Now, do me a favor, keep your ear to the ground, - okay? - Yeah. Manager's going to fuck me in the ass if I don't come up with an answer. You know, he's got somebody coming into town or something. Hey, can I use your bathroom? Thanks. Dude, you're a monster. Man, how do you survive getting hit by a car and then just keep rolling? I've faced down fast-moving certain death a thousand times. Just stay calm and jump. Look, check this out. "Max Fist Versus Muscle Car." A lot of people see those? Hell yeah. Like, people all over? Dude, you're going to be famous. Come on, man. You must've scared everybody. No, I had to scare Cleo. She had to think that I was a force that would never stop, never. Oh, this is you? Yeah, man. It's the Hamster Nest. Oh, stay calm. And jump. Splash. Did the Manager say anything about me? Like about a promotion or...? When did you say you went to the hotel? She had it. - You took the money? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Wait, wait, wait! You took the money, huh? Tell me you took the money! Say it! You took the money! Say it! Say you took the money! Yes! God damn it. Decker, put him down. - No! Stop! Please! - No, no, no! Please! Hams! Hams, help! Get off of me! Hamster! Behind you! You grab the money. We got to go. I thought you didn't kill people. He's gonna send more people. The Manager. The Manager. That's his name? What are his powers? I mean, what's his threat level assessment? How can you be a so-called fucking superhero and you don't know who runs crime in this town? - I'm not a fucking superhero. - He's not a superhero. We should camp here. Give us time to strategize before we go back after them. We're not going after anybody. We're running. Come on. W... Where are we going to go? They're just gonna hunt us down. Max didn't have to do any of this to help us. You're risking our lives to hang out with some homeless man? You don't know him like I do. You're the one putting us in danger. I'm just trying to keep us alive, okay? - I don't know what you're doing. - We don't have time for this. I just had a gun put in my face. How are you keeping us alive? You wouldn't last two seconds in the real world. - No, I'd last longer than you. - No the fuck you wouldn't. You're a fucking drug dealer. What the fuck?! You cannot run. Hey, I don't care what you do. You make bad choices, you live with them, that's fine. But the kid deserves his own chance. If you run, they will find you, and they will kill him. So what are we supposed to do? You stay and you fight the war. Hamster, don't engage with the troll. Fight the war? How are we supposed to do that? Don't undersell yourself. I'm here with you. I fell through a black hole to get here, and I never knew why until now. It was so I can help you, both of you. When our folks died, I decided that all I want to do is make my brother happy. And I got this money, and we were ready to make the move and... We're still here because of you. I'm here to help you, Indigo. I'm going to kill them all. I'm going to annihilate every last one of them. So that you and your brother can be free. The Manager was never going to let me go. You look insane. This cape, this suit. It's all I have left of another world. You're what's left. Everything else is bullshit. Fuck the past. - Fuck the past. - You got this. Let it burn. Let it burn. We'll clean up this city. We'll start over. Holy shit. You're a monster. We can finish this. Are you ready? Yeah. "H" for Hamster. Yeah, it's beautiful, Max. - Super modified. - Oh, shit. You catch somebody with that, it's pretty severe. Oh. You push that button, and then you'll always know where you are. Thanks, Max. Dude, how did you make this? This is like a real weapon. Wait, are you serious? What, do you think it's easy punching your way through gunfire? Dude, you cannot let Indigo see you do that, Max. There's a fragment of the cosmic blood in this. It's a synthetic analog, but... but... but a scent. A memory. A molecule. Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, fuck. I was given power, power to experience, the universe for everyone, all of the timelines, all at once. Oh, coursing through my mind so that I could save them all. Are you saying that the cosmic blood is fucking methamphetamine? Maybe I haven't tried hard enough. The cosmic blood... - it allows me to ripple through. - What? Ripple through the molecules, do you understand me? Max. Lets me ripple through the molecules. Max. Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Stop it. Max. Max, don't. Max, no! Stop, stop. That's enough. Look. Look. You can see between the worlds. It's just another room. Absolutely. Of course. Boss is coming. Like, imminent. Fuck. Wait, wait, wait. Come on, man, get out of here. Go! Go! Hey, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming! Go, go, go, go, go. This is fucked up. What have we done? The field has changed. We need a new strategy. Max, you've got to stop killing people. Indigo, I need to know about The Manager's boss. - That's the key. - It's the key to what? She's going to kill you. Who is, Max? Who's going to kill me? When The Manager escaped, it was with Cleo. She must have fallen ahead of me through the vortex. This whole time, she's been here running everything. Man, that's just crazy talk, man! There's no crystal cave. There's no blue cosmic blood. You just put us all in danger because you think your archenemy, Cleo, is runnin' shit. She's here. She's here. She's real! Don't you get it? Everything I said is true. I can't do this with you anymore, man. I just can't. Come on. I'll get us a car. We're leaving tonight. Hamster, it doesn't matter what you believe. You're going to be safe. Hallucinations, delusions. Hearing voices. Isn't that what you're telling me? No more fails! Just stop, Max. Just stop, just stop, just stop. He destroyed all of them. Just like you destroyed us. Come to me. Just come to me, Max. Max Fist. Broken hero. A man alone. A dream that never ends. Goodbye, Max Fist. Hamster City is closing down. I got to sleep for, like, an hour, Hamst. I'm exhausted. I feel you. Melissa? Oh, good. I got you. You've been tough to track down. Wait, it... it's kind of a fucked up time for me right now. I can't really talk. I know you're in trouble of some kind. You do? My boss, she wants to help you. She's setting up a brand-new office. She's very powerful, and she loves your work. Let me just wake up my sister. Let your sister sleep. By the time she wakes up, this will all be settled. Just relax. I'm gonna pick you up. - How do you... - See? Here I am. Get in. Come on. You know, while we're waiting, I thought I'd pitch you on something. I think we make a pretty great team. You know, I really appreciate all your support. You're really bailing me out of a pretty fucked situation here. And I've been making a lot of money for you from the... from the neighborhood. But I want to cover the whole country, city to city. I want to go viral. - You want to go viral? - Yeah, I want to go viral. You know, you already perform an important service to social order, to business owners who want to get through a day without a riot erupting. If it weren't for you, those people passed out in the shadows on Fentanyl would be running around smashing windows, burning down buildings, stealing babies, whatever they do. You keep things quiet. But I built this organization. I penetrate every level of society. I'm in the cells of it. You want to go viral, I am the virus. And you're the carrier. Well, I don't see myself that way. You see, I see myself sitting on a balcony at my beach house in Malibu, calling out all the key moves while I'm watching the waves roll by, and right beside me, I see... Well, I see someone very special, someone who can hang with that kind of energy, you know? I wanted to be the greatest scientist in the universe. I taught myself the fabric of 11 dimensional space and how to manipulate it. I wanted to explore. But then I spent all my time building weapons. And robots. And traps. All of my intimate knowledge diverted to one man. So the answer to your "pitch" is no. Go get the mouse. Hi, I'm Melissa. It's amazing to finally meet you. I am so excited to introduce you to Hamster. I just wanted to let you know, you know, sometimes he can be a little bit moody. I mean, obviously he's a genius, but it might just take some time for him to get into it. Do you know what I mean? I doubt it. Hamster! Max, you're in so much pain, and so am I. But I'm going to set us free. With this. I call it "the void machine." - It's a weapon. - You think everything's a weapon, but it's not. When it detonates, it will disrupt the cosmic source. No more hyper-human powers, not for you, not for anyone. Back to humanity for all of us. Especially us. Used to be so hard to keep track of you. Now it's a bit of facial recognition software and a teenager with an iPhone. Put down the gun, Max. - You okay, kid? - I don't know. - You here to rescue me? - This is adorable. It's like adoption day at the fuckin' kitten farm. Toss the gun, Max, or the kid dies. Don't do it, Max. Okay, okay. Are you happy to see me? Come on, Max. At least recognize what this means. For the kid. Get on your fucking knees. Get on your goddamn knees, Max Fist. You fucked up my entire city! You cost me millions of dollars. And for what, huh? I think this has gone on long enough. You need to deal with your employee. My what? The sister. She's downstairs. Go get her. Now, please. I've been here for so long. Building an empire, getting ready for you to come back into my life. Look at you. On your knees. Max, get up. Get up, man. It's everything I always knew. Without the cosmic blood, you're just... another worm. So in a way, the void machine worked. Let the kid go. I didn't think that you'd make a friend. You seem to care about him. You do know that he's a lying, psychotic animal, right? You don't know anything about him. I have a private army of 200 people with assault rifles. And he gave you this to defend yourself. He must not care about you after all. God damn it, Indigo. I had plans for you. What did he tell you about me? You want to tell him the truth? I don't know the truth. Well, then, let's... let's try and walk through it. Was that your wife? Yes. Were you the hero of Chromium? Yes. A hero that nobody wanted? A hero whose rage and violence destroyed an entire city? He doesn't want to answer that, but the answer's yes. ♪ Get down, get down, little Henry Lee ♪ ♪ And spare a kiss or two ♪ ♪ With a little pen knife held in her hand ♪ ♪ She plugged him through and through ♪ You remember this? He did this to me. I have this theory. Something that would happen when you and I are in proximity, a sort of physical reaction. And since I'm a scientist, I need to see for myself. Aah! Oh, fuck. Aah! Where's my brother? It's true. I'll be damned. This is so strange, isn't it? You and I are from another place. We're aliens. Maybe our biology wants to connect. Maybe it wants to intersect. 'Cause you and I were always so special together. That's my guess anyways. He was here six years before you. And I built an empire. And all that time I was thinking that I was wasting my time worrying about how I could hurt you as badly as possible. I couldn't take away your powers there, but here... Fuckin' bitch, what I said! Aaah! I've got you, Max Fist. I never wanted to do this shit! I never wanted to be like you! You lose. I got you. Even without powers. All I want is to see you bleed. What's that? What's that? Indi! Look at you! You're going to be okay. I met a guy who I'd like to say was from another planet. He thought this city was a trap. He thought it was the end. You know, you never really know why it chooses you. It just does. This is Hamster City, motherfucker. And now it has new heroes to protect it. You feel me? Yeah, I know you do. Splash!
