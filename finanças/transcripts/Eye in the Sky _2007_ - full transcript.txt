Not Piggy? - Sorry, I mixed up. - It?s okay. You were wearing a green jacket before. Why?re you stalking me? You blew your cover with this reaction! I?m Sergeant Wong from the Surveillance unit (SU) Morning Sir! When did I get off the Central Market station? 10:55 What did I do? Your phone rang and you?ve talked for around 8 seconds You wrote down something on a blank paper And after that? You made a call at a phone booth outside Bank of China and talked for one and a half minutes. Then you threw that piece of paper... into a purple trashcan. Whom did I come across in the tram? You bumped into a woman and talked to her. What was she like? Around 30s, 5?3" tall, medium build, long hair, was wearing a pair of glasses, brown sweater, black skirt, and also carrying a beige handbag. What about the guy who took my newspaper? Sorry Sir, I didn?t pay attention. Have you thought of... keeping in contact this way? Sorry Sir. Surveillance... literally means "eye in the sky". To read and remember everything in details Yes, Sir Sir, did I fail? I?m still thinking about it. Your performance wasn?t very good, but you look silly, unlike a cop. Welcome to SU. Thank you, Sir! There was an armed robbery in Central. Three masked robbers... intruded inside a jewelry shop. They ransacked the shop and left. The police is blocking the scene, Just catch any one here is good enough. Time for soup. Any lead? Any lead, Wo? Not yet - Any lead? - Nope Brother Shan... Good Fortune! Why didn?t you come out in 3 minutes? He didn?t want to leave. I risked my life. Of course, I wanna take more. You?re the leader. How come you couldn?t manage him? We have scrutinized the surrounding. You knew when the PC would be back. If anything went wrong, they would take care of it. Otherwise, what the hell they were there for? In fact, each should carry a shot gun. Forget that 3 or 4 minutes limit. How could you rob so cowardly? Stop fighting Let?s barbecue Sorry There are cameras everywhere. The police can nail you down even just with a hair. If we are not careful, we?d get caught. I just want to make more money. We risk our lives for only several hundred grand Con men won?t be jailed long for several tens of millions For us, at least more than 1 0 years. It?s becoming more difficult. Wanna change your career? Call up Labor Department tomorrow - Any lead? - No, sir - Any lead? - No, sir - Any lead? - No, sir Rewind... Okay Pause This uniform fellow should thank God. Have you seen a fat man wearing a khaki windbreaker, navy-green T shirt and light green trousers? I?ve seen him from the tape of a convenience store. Check his Octopus. (an electronic pay card) Only this lift reaches that level. What was that delivery lady like? To read and remember! Good morning. - Good morning, Dog Head - Her first day here I?m Bobo. Put it aside. We don?t need to carry our pass. Yes, Sir No need to call me Sir Here?s not a police station. We use a code name instead. Think of one? - Wolfie? - No good. Leopard? Piggy! No Dog Head. - Good morning - No. I don?t want... New colleague, her code is Piggy. - Good morning... - Hi... Welcome Piggy! Thank you! Come in Good morning, Madam. New colleague. Her code is Piggy Good morning, Madam Be smart. Don?t be a fool. This bastard is our new target; his code is "Fatman". The intelligence shows that he is a suspect in that heist The information from Octopus Company shows that... he always shows up by the Jordan MTR station, and shops in the nearby four convenience stores. Presumably he lives nearby. We must track him out and search for his background. He may carry a gun. You both be sure to... take care of your subordinates. Yes, madam! Let me return to the control room first. You better quickly prepare, don?t waste time. We only wear it on field, to save battery. Calm down! - Dog Head calling Zoo - Send Just on field It?s pretty new. Please take a look... I don?t want it... Snakie, get rid of her. - Okay, 200 bucks... - Okay Dog Head I saw a suspected "Fatman". Heading to Jordan. Wearing a brown coat, green trousers... Loachy, check him out. Not "Fatman", not "Fatman". Damn it! You love speaking foul words. Bet guys are scared of you Damn! Sorry Sir. - I thought you were our lucky star. - Sorry If we could get him in a few days, we?re very fortunate. Dog Head, will we end up empty hand? It?s very common! We would get him sooner or later. It?s a matter of time. I lost my target once, no more lead. When I returned home, the target has moved to next door. It?s called comeuppance. Dog Head calling Iron Horse, drive around. Roger How?s Master? Life in the prison is... certainly no good. And he has to serve a long sentence. How long so far? It?s already 1 8 years. That?s right. It?s a blessing if he doesn?t have any major illness. 30%, that?s it. Wanna take a new job? Can we have a cut at 40%? My pals are complaining. You are putting me in a difficult position. This is the rule. How could I ask for it? Tell me how to do so! How about you take my share as well? I have to explain it to my pals. Your Master may release earlier... because of good conduct He is already in his 60s. I do want to earn more money... so he could have a better life afterwards. I?ll try my best. But I can?t promise anything. Thank you Snakie changes your outfit, moves to point B. Cat changes your outfit to point D Fishy and Dragon, to point C Duckie and Craby, to point E Shrimpy, Chicken Little... Run away, run faster, you bastard. Dog Head, what should we do? Don?t bother it. We?re on a mission. Shrimpy, Chicken Little, Loachy, pretend as pedestrians. Damn Fattie, still don?t settle the debt, we?ll kill you. Are you clear? Back to work. Get off and stretch out. Dog Head, it?s boring. How about telling us a joke? Don?t play me. Madam would scold me. You won?t care anyway. Tell me a good one. I get one, a true story.
