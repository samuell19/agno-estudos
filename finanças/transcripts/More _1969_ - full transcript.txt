THIS FILM IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR 13 YEARS OR OVER Shit! - You don't look German. - Well, I am. You don't look like a hitchhiker. 'I had imagined this journey as a quest. 'I finished my studies in math. 'I wanted to live. 'I wanted to burn all the bridges, all the formulas, 'and if I got burned, that was OK too. 'I wanted to be warm. 'I wanted the sun. 'And I went after it.

What's up? - This money, where did it come from? Listen, you play like a jerk and don't even have a pad. Forget it. But why? Could bring me luck. - Thanks. - Come on, man. Don't be a drag. What's your name, anyway? Stefan Brückner. I'm Charlie. What are you drinking? But I'll pay, huh? Two beers. Looks like you've been travelling a long way. Yes, from Lübeck. - And where are you heading for? - Don't know. Maybe to Fez. I'm interested in Arab mathematicians. Morocco. I was once there with a friend of mine. We were chased by cops. - I mean, they were not really cops. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, we'll find you a pad. - A what? - A pad. A room. - Oh, that's nice. - Mmm. Charlie, how did you put the money back in my pocket? There are ways. - It's a professional secret. - Huh? You have slippery fingers, huh? - But never to take. - Mmm. I hope so. Do you feel well? Well, how did it go? It didn't. I played for an hour without getting a pair. Then I drew a full house, but the other guy had a royal flush. How can we find some bread? Work. - Doing what? - Don't know. What about selling, er... postcards or subway maps or something like that? Yeah, man, I can really see us. How about hustling girls, huh? - Same as cards. You need capital. - Mmm. - Hey. - Huh? Are you, like, honest? Mmm. So-so. And you? Yeah. Like you. So-so. I've got just the job. A beauty. I saved it for a friend. - How much? - 2,000, because it's a little risky. Nothing serious. The owners live there year-round, but spend every weekend in the country. You could do it Saturday night. It's a cinch. - What neighbourhood? - Étoile. High-class. Let's see the layout. It's a piece of cake. Bedroom, bathroom, living room, one toilet, two toilets, three toilets! You buying the goods? - In cash? - As always. Just a minute. Got the money? - You want it now? - I'd prefer. Listen, I'll have it in a few days. Fine, if no one takes the job before then. - Weren't you saving it for a friend? - Friends are a dime a dozen. Give me the money. It's not much, but it's a lot for us. We'll have the rest Wednesday. - OK. - Ciao. ♪ I was standing by the Nile... ♪ Hey. - Hello, Charlie. - How are you? - What's happening here? - Don't worry about that. - Did you get the money? - Only 200 francs. Well, I have 550. We still need 100. I know. Whose apartment is this? Some rich American. He thinks he's a hippy. The guy over there. - Let's have a drink. - Yeah. - Very nice here. - Here. ♪ Soaring high above the breezes ♪ Going always where she pleases ♪ She will make it to the islands ♪ In the sun ♪ I will follow in her shadow... ♪ Who are all these people? The usual crowd. I only know a few of them. The guy over there who's passing the cigarette. I don't know. He's always around. 'I fell in love at first sight. 'That's the way I am. ' And the girl? The blonde? - Where? - In the corner. 'I was jealous of the guy she was talking to. ' What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? Her name is Estelle. She lives in New York. I used to see her in the Pussycat. - But, uh... - What? - Keep away. - Aren't I good enough? That's not the point. I can't explain. - But why? - Oh, come on. Have another drink. - I'm switching to beer. - Try the kitchen. I can't find any beer. - Want me to fix you something? - Oh, yes, fine. What shall we make? - Want a margarita? - Whatever you like. - Can I help you? - No. Thank you. What's your name? Estelle. So, what's Charlie doing? Nothing. What about you? Nothing. And you? Nothing. How come you're not drinking? Didn't you like my thing? Oh, yes. And I even feel a little drunk. So do I. I asked Charlie about you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What did he say? No, I won't tell. Oh, shit. Go on. Well, er... - Well, I saw you in the corner. - Mmm? And I asked Charlie, and he told me that you are... - Hey, we're going. - What's the matter? Hurry up. We've got to split. Hello, baby. - What's happening? - Where can I call you? Where? - Hotel Louisiane. - OK. I got the rest of the money. - How? - Your chick left her bag lying around. - What? - Her bag. Thanks for keeping her busy. - You bastard. - Oh, come on. It's only what we needed, 200 francs. I'll bring it back to her right now. Listen, let's get through with our deal. Then you can play the gentleman. Why don't you forget about Estelle? Fuck. Clothes. Only clothes. - Hey, Charlie. - What? Come here. Whoa. - Who is it? - Stefan. - Who? - Stefan! Hello. I wish you'd call before coming. I brought you a present. What a pretty package. I'm returning the 200 francs I stole from you. Interesting. Come in. - They've grown to 400 now. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - How come? The interest on the loan. I made a good deal, thanks to you. Congratulations. Next time I want to make an investment, I'll come to you. Yeah, er... It was also an excuse to see you again. You don't have to pay for that. I wanted to tell you something. Go ahead. But I don't know how to go about it. Try. Well, uh... Forget it. I think I understand. Yeah. - Well, I think I'd better go. - Wait a minute. Don't go. Why? - I like to hear you talk. - OK.

When I was in New York I used to take dope, and... the needle was dirty. When was it? About a year ago. But you haven't done it since? No. Good. Otherwise, I'd give you a rough time, baby. That's a hell of a way to begin. I missed my plane. - What plane? - I'm going to Ibiza. I go tomorrow. - Want to come with me? - Of course. But I can't leave at once. - Why not? - I have to finish that deal I made. I'll be over in a week. OK? Good. When you get there, ask for Ernesto Wolf - because that's where I'll be staying. - OK. Ernesto Wolf. What's this? Read it. "The brain is like a map of Africa in 1850, "still largely uncharted. "In these dark areas, "the higher functions of reasoning and creativity take place. " Oh-la-la. Coffee. Thanks. Do you know Dr Wolf’s address? Hotel del Sol Negro, up the hill. Thank you. Excuse me. Is Dr Wolf here? - No, he's not. - No? Are you sure? I was told that... He owns the hotel, but he lives in his villa. He doesn't like to be disturbed. Er, is Estelle Miller here? No, she's not. No? But she stays here? Yes, but she's out. OK. Do you know when she'll be back? She hasn't been back for two days. Would you please give me her key? She's expecting me. I'm afraid not, sir. She didn't leave any instructions. OK. Then give me the address of Dr Wolf. Well... Dr Wolf! A beer, please. One for me, too. Hey, guess what, one for me as well. Oh, in this heat... It's so hot. Must get better ones. - Where exactly are the knives? - He's not holding it right. - No. - No. - Now let's see what you can do. - Ramon, where's the beer? A beer! This fucking heat. Now watch. Nice. Good throw. Now it's your turn, Hans. Pretty good! - No, nothing, again. - Grab the front end of the knife. - Yeah, sure. - That wasn't too bad. I don't know, I'm not doing too well today. OK, give them to me. Now I want to give it a try. Give me both. Yes, those two. Give me the other one. Come on, kid. Give me one, too. Fabulous! - That was really fantastic! - Thank you. - Boy, oh, boy. - Well, it had to work out eventually. - You're really the best. - Fabulous. Thanks. - Excuse me, are you Dr Wolf? - Yes, I am. - I'm from Lübeck. - Ah, Lübeck. I know it well. - You wanted to talk to me? - Yes. Well, then come and have a drink first. Come on. Ramon, two absinthes. You're good at that little game. I've never seen it before. What is it? Oh, I enjoy it very much. Sometimes I get a little sentimental. Then I remember the good old days. Well, let's drink. - Prost. - Prost. How do you like this stuff? First time I've had it, Dr Wolf. Call me Ernesto. They all call me that here. I hate formalities. - Have you been here for a while? - I just arrived by boat this morning. What can I do for you? Well... I'm looking for one of my friends, Estelle Miller. She told me you would know where she was. Oh, Estelle. Yes, she's a nice girl. She's staying at my hotel. Have you gone there yet? Yes, but she disappeared two days ago. "Disappeared" is a strong word. You know, this island is crowded with strange types. Nobody knows where they come from and where they go. Perhaps Estelle met up with a group like that. The partying usually ends up on the beach in the morning. Have you gone there yet? No. - But I'll give it a try. - Yes. - May I sit down? - Sure, man. - Well, did you find him? - Who? Wolf. Why do you ask? Everything about Wolf interests me. Er, shrimp... salad... red wine. - Do you know him well? - None of us knows him well. - And you? - I just met him. It's a pity. What does Wolf do, exactly? Oh, he does a lot of things, you know. What is it? Go on. Take one. It's good for you. It'll pick you up. You look pretty tired. OK. You didn't answer. What does Wolf do? Er... I told you. He does a lot of things. He's got some restaurants. He owns a hotel and a bar. But, actually, I think it's a cover. Actually, I think he ran into trouble after the war and there's some kind of ex-Nazi thing which is based in the Mediterranean. Anyway, that's what people say. And, er... What about his girl, Estelle Miller? What do they say about her? Oh, I don't know that she's his girlfriend. She's certainly part of his crowd. I want to give you some advice. Go easy with Wolf. He can get pretty nasty. This pill is really working, huh? What is it? - It's a purple heart. - Purple heart? Yeah, purple heart. You can get it here without prescription. Purple heart? Where were you? I've been looking for you all over the place. Oh, yeah? I've been around. Aren't you even going to say hello? Hello. You look strange. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Did you have a nice trip? - Yeah, thank you. - What's the matter with you? I want to know where you have been for the last two days! - Don't be vulgar. - I don't give a damn. Where were you? Well, it's like this. I took a little trip, and I don't feel much like talking about it now. Let's sit over there. - It's nice, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. - How do you feel? - OK. - What are you thinking about? - You told me not to speak. That's true. So, you finally found her. They come, they go, my friend. You'll get used to it. Mind you, it wouldn't do you any harm to be a little more serious, my sweet. A nice, warm shower, a great steak and a good night's sleep. That's what you need. Sounds lovely. I'll take care of Estelle. Can I stay with you? - No. - No? They don't like that sort of thing in Spain. Ah, come on! I just don't want you to, that's all. But why? You get on my nerves. You keep saying things I don't want to hear. - See you. - What's got into you? - I've just had enough, that's all. - Of me? I can't explain. Why don't you leave me alone? Why does everybody have to bug me? All right, I'll go. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Come and lie down next to me. Do whatever you like. I warn you, I won't move. I won't even think about it. What are you thinking of? I want you to go. Again? I don't understand you. I know you don't. Why do you want me to go? Because sometimes I love you, sometimes I don't. "They come, they go", as Wolf says. He even added that I'd get used to it. But don't count on it. I don't. Repeat what you just said. Sometimes you love me. Sometimes I love you. Then you really do love me? - Is it true? - Yes. Now please go. I won't leave you before you tell me what you are doing with that man. - What man? - Don't pretend. - What man? - Wolf. Oh, you're kidding. He was a friend of my father's. Want to go to a party tonight? Where? You take the road to San José and you go straight until the 7km mark. You take the first turn to the right. There's this little road, and there'll be a big fire there. And that's where it's at. OK. But listen, Estelle, we... Please! Go away. Stefan. Wow, I'm really glad you came. Listen, you shouldn't take things so seriously. Because sometimes I get a little bitchy, but it doesn't mean anything. OK? - Want to come and meet my girlfriend? - Yeah. Stefan, this is Cathy. - Hello. - Hello. Something stinks. It's me. May I kiss you? - No. Beard's too long. - I dig it that way. Up to you. I stink, and I prickle. - Shall we go over there? - Yeah. Hey, hey. You shouldn't mix it with alcohol. Hey. Mind your own business. Where are we going to sleep? Well, you can sleep here. I'll ask somebody, and they'll lend you a room. Yeah, but what about you? I live with Cathy. Then you really don't want me anymore? I don't get the connection. You don't love me anymore? You're crazy. I'm wild about you. Oh, you tart! You bastard! You want a slap? Try it! You bastard. Oh, you deserve another one, but I'm dead. Good. Stay that way. You behave like a whore. - Because I sleep with you. - Shh! Someone might hear us. - So what? - They might tell Wolf. I really got her there, huh? Shut up. Admit. He lays you. Do you like getting laid by old men? This is really an attractive couple. This is really groovy. Don't you think so? - I'm getting out of here. - Wolf and her. You make me sick! Don't leave. Tell me first where my room is. You were very uncool. I promise, there's nothing between Wolf and me. Like I said before, he's a friend of the family. He puts me up and feeds me. That's all. If you keep asking me, I'll only repeat myself. I won't ask you anymore. Tell me, why are you afraid to have me stay with you? I'm not afraid. I just don't want to create any problems. I don't give a damn. I want to sleep with you every night. Me too. Well, good. Then I don't see any problems. Bill said he'd lend me his house on the other side of the island. All we have to do is move in. That's not going to make Wolf very happy. You can't make everybody happy. I just don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I know you don't. I'll pick you up at 3:00 in the morning and no one will see us, hmm? - Where does this tunnel go? - To the sea. I'll be right back. - What is it? - Shh. What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, Christ. Bitch! Where's the packet? The white packet tied with a red ribbon? Didn't you see them leave? This is how you work? Sleeping? Sleeping, with what I pay you? We have to find them. Watch every boat. Look for his car! Do you know about the sun worshippers? There are young men in Calcutta who suddenly decide to devote their lives to the worship of the sun. They sit cross-legged and completely naked and stare at it all day long. Pretty soon they go blind. And after about a year they shrivel up like plants and die.

You shaved your legs again. - Do you love me? - No. 'Estelle just wouldn't go outside. 'She was scared of everything except our house. ' - No, I wouldn't touch it again. - Oh, come on, Estelle. I'm sure you have some, just in case. No, I haven't got any. Is David back yet? No. Is that why you're freaking out? Yes. He won't come back. I think I need a little horse. OK. I'll try and get you some. But, er... can you keep it cool? Because Stefan's going to be back any minute. Oh, yes. What is he going to say when he sees me? Nothing. I'll tell him that you told me you were coming and that I forgot to tell him about it. But he knows I didn't have your address. I'll tell him that I sent it to you. After all, it's the truth. Even when you're saying the truth, you look like you're lying. Oh, yeah? How do you feel about Stefan? I like him a lot. Are you in love with him? I guess so. I adore you. Come and help me mend the sail. No, I'm tired. - Hello. - Hi. Did I scare you? Not at all. Did you just get back? Yeah. - Why didn't you come in? - I was just resting for a minute. I thought you were mending the sail, huh? Oh, I was going to, but Cathy came. I forgot to tell you she was coming. Tell me. What's "horse"? - "Horse"? - Yeah. I have no idea. You know, I'm really worried about Cathy. She's terribly upset. I think you ought to make love to her. Cathy? Cathy. Tell me, what's "horse"? Heroin. Heroin? - Do you take it? - Not now. Last year, Estelle and I were shooting but we were lucky enough to get away from it. 'Cathy left the next day. 'The confusion she left behind her scarred both of us. ' Estelle? Estelle. Estelle! Hey! Hey! Hey! Estelle? What's the matter? Tell me. What is it? Nothing. Too much sun... Wind... I don't know. I'll call a doctor. No doctor. Stay with me. Where have you been? I missed you. What's this? What's this? Started again! Where have you hidden the rest? There isn't any more. Cathy. Cathy gave it to you. Is that right? No. I stole it. From Ernesto. I'll never do it. I swear. I... "I" what? I love you. You must admit, this is better than that junk of yours, huh? It's very different. What's the difference? This makes everything beautiful and alive. Horse just makes you feel very comfortable. Uh-huh. That's what horse is. Yeah. People who take horse want to escape from life. People who smoke this, or take acid want to intensify their lives. Hippies put horse down. And junkies put down the little fools that think they've discovered the world. Hardly anybody mixes the two. They lead completely different ways of life. So, you are an exception, huh? Yeah. Estelle. I swear, I'm not angry. I am not lecturing you. But why did you start again? - I only took one shot. - Yes, but why? I don't know. You'd been so mean to me. You kept bugging me about Wolf and everything. Just depressed. I thought we were happy together. Maybe you were, but I wasn't. You were always saying that you love me. I do love you. It has nothing to do with it. - Stefan? - Yes? - You know what's really awful? - No. Tell me. Getting hooked. It's the end. But if you only take one shot every once in a while it's no different than an occasional drink or cigarette. What are you trying to say? I've got a little left. But you told me you didn't have any more. I only took half of what I had. I have the other half left. - Give it to me. I'll throw it in the john. - Whatever you say. But it's over here. OK, come on. Looks like flour. Do you know how much that flour's worth? - No, how much? - About 10 dollars. I don't give a damn about the stuff. But it's rather foolish to throw it away. You know... ...there'd be absolutely no danger if we split that little bit. We can't get any more anyway. I know a way. Just ask Wolf. You have a perfect sense of timing. - Would you like to try it? Just once. - No. No! How can you pass up a new experience? I'd love to take it with you. - Are you afraid? - No. But you're not going to have any. Relax. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Good morning. I brought you some tea. Mr Brückner, would it be possible for me to pose a few questions concerning your experience of yesterday evening? Hmm? How do you feel this morning? Mmm, OK. And how did you feel yesterday evening? Oh... Thank you very much. Very well. Fantastic. And, er, was it worth it? Well... I believe that everything has to be paid for. The better the value, the higher the price. Oh, yeah. Certainly. People never understand the Germanic temperament. Where's pleasure without tragedy? Do you have any left? - Be careful, Stefan. - Do you have any? 'The second fix was a letdown. Terrible. 'I'd make the third fix be the second and forget what was bad. ' 'Time.

Shall we take you home? - No, thank you. - Smile, please. Get lost. - I said we are taking you home. - Come on. I don't mind about the guy. But you have stolen 200 doses from me. What are you planning to do about it? Don't try to run away. I'd get you both into trouble with the police. Do you want to sit in jail for a few years? I know the right people and you'd be caught right away. You see, I am having you watched. Haven't you noticed people making charcoal near the house? So, my little one, this is what I propose. - It's about time. - I've got to tell you something. - I need a fix. - Please, Stefan, listen. It's important. - I tell you, I need a fix! Please. - OK. Take it easy. It's your 12th one. Keep the lecture for later. Fix me. Hurry up! Come on. What were you just saying? I didn't steal one bag from Wolf. I stole 200. He might not like that. He isn't happy at all. Give them back to him. - Are you sure you want me to? - Mmm. Here's the thing. He's really mad. So I'll give him back what's left. But because he likes you, all you have to do to pay him back for the shots you've already had is go to work for him as a barman for a little while. Oh, yeah? He can go to hell. We haven't any choice. We're in a spot. But if you work a little, everything will be cool and... ...we can even keep a few bags. No. It's either that, or he's going to get us busted. Well, we can leave. Go pack, woman. Come and take a look. What are they doing? They're making charcoal. 'We moved back to town, 'close to my work.

Oh, I am so tired. - You look well. - Better than you. - You earned a lot of money in Paris? - A little. - Pinball machines? - Things like that. Oh-la-la. You can give me a little bit. I need a little bit. Let's have a coffee, hmm? Tell me, do you think I am finished? No, I don't think you're finished. But you'd better get the hell out of here fast. We'll leave for Paris tomorrow. Get your things together right now, and say goodbye to Estelle. - Why? - "Why?" Do you know how many guys she's destroyed already? Two. Real nice guys. Want to be the third man? I warned you about her, didn't I? Remember the party? What about her? - Well, what about her? What's going to happen to her? Listen, where she's at, doesn't matter anymore. Estelle? Hi. Have you seen Estelle? No, man. Hi, Tommy. Have you seen Estelle? No. It's too early, man. 3:00 am. Girls who come after midnight make me sick. Move. I don't think she's so special anyway. You just got carried away, that's all. And she has fat legs. And she talks a lot of shit. Move. You're going to lose your rook. Hey, don't you care about losing your rook? OK, I'll take it. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I... Yeah, you need a fix. Well, go take it. We'll start the cure in Paris, peacefully. Yeah. - Where the hell have you been? - Give it to me! - Speak! - Fuck you. Give it to me! - Speak! - Please! Speak! Where were you? Shopping. Shopping? Where are the things you bought? I left them at Susan's. I spent the day with her. I saw Susan. She told me she never had seen you. Give it to me! Give it to me! Go on. What were you saying? I want to know your timetable. I also want to know where you have been on 3 October. If I tell you, will I get my stuff? Yes. Even if you don't like what you hear? Yes! Swear. Swear! OK, I swear! All right. I was with Wolf. In fact, I've been with him quite often. I don't like him. That's the way it is. Sorry. Now... OK. I'll prepare it for you. What was all that racket? She's gone. Where? Gone. Well, isn't that what you wanted? Isn't it? - Answer me. - No, no. That's what you wanted. The boat is sailing in two hours. You'll be out of here. I can't make it without her. - I'm going to find her. - What are you talking about? Don't go. Don't do it. Ah, you're crazy. Estelle! Estelle! Estelle! Nobody's here! Get lost! Get out of here or I'll shoot. I'll shoot, get it? Estelle! Where is Estelle? - Please. Excuse me. - Yeah. - Do you have any horse? - Horse? - Yeah? - No. Oh, please, please, come on. I... I swear I'll give it back to you tomorrow night. I need it. Well, why don't you get some at the bar? No. I... I can't find my key. - Pick some up at home. - No. I- I-I... I threw away my-my things. I... You know, I... I am crazy. I went crazy. I... Be nice, man. I need it. I am losing my mind. Please. Thank you. Excuse me. Please, give me... Give me two. Two. Thank you. Listen, take it easy with that. - Don't take them both at once. - OK. 'Those stupid bastards thought he'd killed himself. 'They wouldn't give him a religious funeral. 'Although it was winter, the sun was shining like on a hot summer day. '
