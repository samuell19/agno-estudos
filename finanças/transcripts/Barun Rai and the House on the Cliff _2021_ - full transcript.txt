Violence is around us everywhere. We see violence every day. We see it on TV. We can't pick up the newspaper without reading about it. It is a violent society. Police getaway, giving excuses that these are mysteries... and involve the Paranormal. Violence is around everywhere. With crime in New York on the rise this year... the number of unsolved cases is beyond count. Police needs to hire Special Investigators to solve such cases. The problem with New York now are that the police aren't bothered. Cases get opened and then get shut. Just like that. Same with Emily Anderson's missing case. She mysteriously disappears and the next day, Cory murders her whole family. How and why are the police still, baffled? If we were the police, we want answers! You just have to go out there and do your job. Hi, buddy! Wait, you got scared? Our world is far beyond the ordinary. Ooh, new guest in the house. Do you want something? Most of us can't see all that surrounds us. Say it as a gift or a curse. I see things others cannot. Cory, why are you here at this hour? Don't kill me. Hold on. Get up Cory. Don't! He's a moron. Get out, Cory. Don't kill me. Oh, my God! What happened to you? Oh, my God, what happened to you? Cory, is that... What happened to you? Why do you have a gun in your hand? Stop, Cory, Stop! No! Leave us alone. Stop! No! Leave us alone! Don't betray! Kill yourself? Now kill yourself! Oh, that's great, mama! - Cory Marchman. - Did he do it? No. But it was his finger that pulled the trigger. It was possession. It's a textbook case. What do you mean by possession? Like paranormal? I saw something. I saw some... It was a girl. She-- She made him do it. How'd you know it was a girl? Are you a psychic? Well, I'm a criminal investigator by title. And I deal with cases that are out of the ordinary. A ghost? There's a picture of her in the basement. The girl. Thank you very much. After speaking with NYPD neighborhood co-ordination office the Wake-up New York Radio News team confirmed that the body of Emily Anderson was identified at 07:05 this morning near the Hudson River. Principal cause of the death has believed to be choking. The Emily Anderson case is sloved Finally, the case has been solved. The mystery of her death Is finally revealed. It was Justice Barun Rai has solved the paranormal case. So another suicide at Corvid's head in the same year. But what is it about this beautiful village which compels people to take their own lives? There's this thick fog that goes into the sea in the early mornings. I see it sometimes when i am on an early ride. It's hard to focus. Sometimes you can't see 10 yards in front of you. Everyone knows everyone else around here. So, when there's a certain death... it doesn't just affect the immediate family it affects all of us. It becomes quite disorientated. I suppose you could misjudge where the edge of cliff's actually is. Some folk around here say that they've seen a lady walking along the cliff. Then she disappears like a ghost! And we don't understand why? This rumor is going around in the village There's a lady on the edge of the cliff killing people. In small-knit community like this one these tragic deaths will be mourned by many. We asked a local police officer, Inspector Jenny Jones about the rumors that these deaths are actually murders. I can't possibly comment on the status of the current investigation. While I can say is that our heartfelt condolences go out to the families of the victims. And if anyone has any information they feel they might be useful... we would urge them to contact us. When we think in terms of Criminal Psychology we are always told that every crime has a means of motive and opportunity. But what if a crime does not have any apparent motive? The crime contains a paranormal element. This man here, a much-loved gardener in Santa Monica California was accused of those killings. With a whole village was shocked as to how he could've done it? And yet we had conclusive evidence that he was the perpetrator. That is... unless his mind his movements were being controlled by some other entity. In every case, it's important. It's imperative that we keep an open mind we trust our instincts and what we perceive to be the facts of the situation. Come and have a look at this. Do you see these flecks? I've never seen them on suicide before. Okay, so...? They are called Petechiae. And they're caused by pressure on the vein. And very common in cases of Asphyxiation. But not enough for... So, what's the cause of death here? Well, quite certain, he died of his injury. The head wound. A subdural haematoma caused by cervical-spine-trauma to be specific. But that would mean that... succession marks up here is after death. How is that even possible? - Hello? - Barun, it's Jenny. Council is meeting about the things happening around here. Can you meet me there? I need to give the specifics for the Corvid's Head suicides. I'll see you shortly. Bye! Ma'am, Brian was found with inappropriate pictures again. You know the drill, Brian. Do you want to spend the night in the cells? Right! Well, let's see if we can reschedule then. Shall we? Alright. Make a copy of these and give his mum a call. Tell her to come and pick him up. Yes, ma'am! We travel, some of us forever to seek other states, other lives, other souls. My next destination is Corvid's Head. A small town across the channel. - Hello, Sukhbir. - Hey, good to see you. Whatever, you don't tell them we are from the paranormal. We are from ITN News. We heard that we're getting desperate. You are from the paranormal, aren't you? We wouldn't know anything about that. About the suicides? - No, no, clue. - Are you sure? There have been rumors about ghosts. You flew in from the USA, I see. Has this got anything to do with Nixon? Come on, man! Following the reports about the leak from a factory in Hampton Park we have approached the business owner. And in return for maintaining his trading license he has agreed to commission a report connecting the link between factory fumes - and mental health. - Barun, we have a word. You haven't missed much. They seem to think there's a link between factory fumes and suicides. What's puzzling me is the flecks in the victim's eyes. Symptoms of asphyxiation. But we can't place anyone there at the scene. Do you have-- any images? Any evidence? - No! - Hmm. It's quite a while came to the country, isn't it? - I'll see you back at the police station. - Yeah. This way, gentlemen. Can you grab the files for me, please, Shaun. I sure see there's quite a lot to go through. Hmm-mm. Thank you. - May I keep them for a few days? - Yes, absolutely! Thank you. I've come for Brian. Where is he? I'll go and get him, madam. Put your hands out. Come on further. All the way around. Right. Put them back in. Get your hands off him. There's no need to restrain him. He would never fly. Would you love it? You need to keep a better eye on him. He's a grown man! Grown men go to jail for repeat offended. - Harmesh? - Yes! It's way above our price range. Listen, it'll be worth it, okay? I have a good feeling about this. Why don't we fancy one of those flats next to the marketplace? No! It's so beautiful here. And it's just like a short walk from the hospital. You're going to be home 10 minutes after you finish your shift. I mean, even the air smells fresher here. It's like you! Beautiful! If the new couple finds out about this... it's going to put them off. I thought you said they weren't from here. Look, if they show up, make sure they buy it. Let's just get rid of it before anything else happens. Alright! And she blushes... Stop it. Hey! - Oh, is that it? - Hey! - I think it's that one. - Oh-oh, it's beautiful. Yeah! But why do we need such an expensive house? I think we should reconsider, Harmesh. Why? Look, we are here now. We'll go inside. And we'll take a look. - Okay? - Okay... Hey, Sophie, we are here! You are really going to I love this house. Wow! The things here are original. Everything seems just perfect! It's pretty big. You can convert it to another room. Okay. Eh, hold my hand. - Careful! Your head. - Yeah. Wow! Oh, my God! - This is interesting. - Yeah, it's quite spacious. Hmm... I bet you love this place. Yeah. You know we can turn this into our children's playroom. Hmm... maybe! First, we have to... give us the babies. Are you alright? Yeah, Sophie, it's great. We are coming. Hey, what's this? What's this?! Oh, my God! It's a book. Listen, it's not yours. Keep it back. Come on. I know! - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. Wow! Lovely, isn't it? Beautiful. Will you take it? - Oh, well... - Hmm-mm. I think we'll take it. I'll see you back at the office. Hey, uh... Sophie? Is there anything you're not telling us? It's ridiculously good price. - Yeah, that it is. But uh... - That it is! Okay, Sophie, do you mind, if we walk around for a bit? Help yourselves! - Hmm... - She's weird. Hmm? - Yeah, but the house is nice. - Yeah. Wow, I love it. Barun, you cracked the California case very easily. There was no motive for the guy to do what he did. His records were clean. Now coming to Corvid's Head case. No, sane person... without any issues just suddenly commit suicide. Exactly! So, Barun... What's your-- What's your gut feeling about this one? I don't know. We need more... circumstantial evidence. Someone is there. Oye! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, stop! What do you think you are doing? I'm sorry. Your curtain was open. Eh... give me that. No! Please important pictures. Please don't! You know you can't be taking pictures of people when they are in private. I won't! What's your name? Brian! Brian, you do that again... and I will report to you. Do you understand? Take this and go. And I don't want to see you here anymore. - Harmesh? Harmesh? What is this doing here? Strange! Tsk... Oh, my God! Soumili Who is that? You're going to die. Uh... Soumili, they are here. That's Soumili, my wife. She's the one who actually heard something. So, you didn't actually see anyone inside the house? I'm sure someone was here. Because the windows were open. Oh... The box was emptied on the floor. A box? Where's that now? I cleared it out. Oh, you shouldn't be really tampering with evidence. - Umm... sorry. - And what did you hear? I'm sure I heard something. Because that woke me up. And what's that? Umm... Erm... it's empty, though. Old plumbing. It makes a hell of a racket. - Should we have a look? - Yeah, sure. Yes. Umm... this way. It's only recently that we have moved here. Alright. Where from? - Anything? - Nothing! Well, that doesn't appear to be any more signs of an intruder. So... That's it! Nothing you can do? Well, you heard a noise and so that box had fallen over. Nothing had been taken, so... No, I saw something. I'm sure! Truth is... I was asleep at the time. Eh... it could be these all windows. It's the sea breeze around here. It's stronger than you think. Oh, if it's just the windows then I can fix them. Great! I will get in touch if you have any more concerns. Come this way. That's okay. We can see ourselves out. Thank you, officer. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Hi Sukhbir! - Hey! - Mmm... - Okay! And it's right next to the cliff. Wow! How about a housewarming party? Good afternoon. I'm from Corvid's Head church. - Hello, father. Please come in. - Thank you. - My name is my father, Paul. - Hello! How's it been in the house? Eh... good! Would you mind if I perform a blessing? Oh, of course not. Is it a tradition in the village? Well, the house has been empty for some time. - Sure! I'll get you a glass of water. - Thank you. Oh, Holy Father... we welcome your spirit into this place. Get out now! Get out! Father? Tell me! I have failed... Failed! Failed! Failed! We can't afford failure, father Paul. Helpless lambs when the spirit is too powerful. We can't do anything. Its necessary for us to recognize our limitations. The best way we could serve our flock... is to steer everybody that we can away from the danger. I don't think we can ignore this one... sir! I've been having terrible pain in my stomach from the past couple of hours. Umm... initially, I thought it was muscular. -Myalgia-- -Myalgia? Erm... I'm a nurse. At the hospital? I will be at the hospital in a couple of weeks. I've just moved here. - From India? - Yes! I'm from Delhi. But I have been working in the UK for quite some time now. We... erm... bought a new house at Corvid's Head. I'm assuming yo've... considered all the obvious triggers; something you've eaten... injury, etcetera. Now tell me, Mrs. Banerjee. Are you an anxious person? - Moving house is stressful. - It is. - Specially when-- - Go on! I think I had a break-in in my house. Do you think? - You called the police? - Yes. But they weren't sure. And then... And then, I started doubting myself. It was night... I don't know. How are you sleeping? Not very well lately. Stress can manifest itself in a physically way, you know. As pain! And sleep deprivation will only exacerbate this. I'm prescribing you some anti-depressants. Yes! I'm Barun Rai. I'm working with the police. Is Brian in? He has done nothing wrong. I keep telling you lot. I- Not even nicked any sweets lately-- - No, no, no! It's not about that. I hear he's a photographer. I'm interested in taking a look at some of the pictures he's taken. You're as bad as her. Who? You are not having his photos. So, get out of here. Stop hounding him. Although the arrest for theft could've been far worse, you know. Just like her. I can get a search warrant. If you're going to make this any more difficult. Thank you. You know, Jenny, the deaths look strange. They don't look like suicides. Yes, the anomaly with the eyes. It's been picked up by the coroner by the victims, but... as you know, they do appear to be suicides. There seems to be a shadow in these photos. Look at this lot. Do you see something here? They seem to be taken about the same time they were going to jump. The same guy took both. And I know what you are thinking. But he's not a suspect. He's this simple guy from the village called Brian. Brian, again? He took both photos. That's a strange coincidence. He is harmless. He's just fascinated. He's always taking photos. Hmm... There's a copy of his file in your folder. What about the shadow in the picture... next to the younger man? If you're talking about the bruising on the neck... you're right; I did see. No... the bruising was obvious. I am talking about the shadows standing next to him. This is the spot on the cliff they have been jumping from. And they are all jumping from the same place. How strange? Well, the last few certainly. But when it's high-tide it's impossible to tell. The coroner's report didn't mention any... fume inhalation, did it? No, why? Because if the asphyxiation happened beforehand... then it likely to have been by strangulation. So? You know, Jenny... blocking the airways manually takes a lot of strength. And it takes longer than one thinks. And it's highly unlikely that it happened on the cliff and no one saw it! Hmm... alright! Mrs. Banerjee lives in the house on the clifftop. And she reported hearing strange noises. Maybe we should look into it further. Soumili? Harmesh! - Harmesh! - Soumili? Please come here, Harmesh! Soumili? What just happened? Soumili, are you-- Are you okay? I think I saw something. Wait, wait, wait, wait, you... saw someone here? - No! - Are you sure, Soumili? I-- I'm not sure! - I don't know. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Shush, it's okay. It's okay. - No... - Soumili, it's okay! Hey, it's okay. It's okay, Soumili. Hey! Sush... it's okay. It's okay. It's a new country. It's a new home. It's... It's difficult. I understand, okay! Too much is happening too fast. I know what I saw. You didn't say that one minute ago. You said you're confused about what you saw. It's okay. Hey! Sush... it's okay. Hey, I'm here with you. Okay. Hello, I'm Barun Rai. You are with the police? I'm working with inspector Jones on this one. Okay. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. - Would you like some tea? - No! No, thank you. What absurd noises did you report to Jenny? No, there have been no noises. Not after we have fixed the windows. No, I heard noises. Soumili! Banging, thumping! Different kinds of noises. Kind of-- that makes you feel there's another person in the house. Listen, the truth is that there was an intruder. One of the first night that we were here. And, Soumili has been on the edge ever since. That's understandable. Giving excuses for me? - I'm not-- - They were not just weird noises. No! I have felt fingers on my back pushing me! On my head, my shoulders. It-- it's windy here. And the windows needed fixing and the panes. And we have taken care of it. Okay. The move has been stressful. - I can imagine. - Can you help us? I'll look into it. Thank you very much. But, uh... I don't think we'll need it. - As you wish. Bye. - Yeah. Oh, God! You ask for help from anyone. If you cannot support. At least don't talk. I am very supportive. Mr. Rai! Sorry! - What is this? - I'm not sure. I keep finding this lying around in the entire house. Like somebody has been moving it. Maybe your husband. No, it's not him. I just want this out of my house. - So I'll keep it. I'll look into it. - Thank you. Alexander and I were meant to be together. All those months of hope, the planets suddenly align in my favor. And make them notice me. Now our wedding now will be under the light of lunar blood moon. It only happens every 50 years. I couldn't be happier. Hmm... it looks like some form of a code. Have to ask Sukhbir to decipher it. I have been seeing something really odd. Are you going to say that I'm stressed and tired again. Do you think you're stressed or tired? Yes, obviously, I am. But I'm scared too. I just want... whatever I see, this-- this weird, odd stuff. This just needs to stop. This script looks like, Theban. God! I Haven't seen this at the university. - Gosh, it's cold today. Isn't it? - It's freezing! So, how was your first day in the surgery? It was great! My husband's busy. So, I'm going to go home. I'm going to take the woods. - Careful. Bye. - You too. - Hey! What happened? Are you-- Are you okay? You look worried. You know that guy who was taking our pictures. - Yeah... - He followed me all the way back. - Is he still outside? - No, I ran! But he has followed me from the hospital. He's just a kid. And he loves photography, okay? Nothing to worry about. Yeah! That's the reason he knows my house address and my workplace. Why is he clicking my pictures? - Because you're so beautiful. - No! That's why! - It's not funny. It's scary. - Listen... Do you want me to report him? - Yeah! - Okay, I will. Hmm? Yeah. So, relax. Go take a bath and come. Crazy creep! I'll take care of it. - It's Jenny. - Hello! - Are you alright? Hi... Jenny! Pleased to hear your voice. Never been more glad. In fact. Look, I don't know if it's worth mentioning or not... but the police from Corvid's Head has been in touch. There's been some sort of incident at the house on the cliff. I wonder if it's connected to the suicides. Okay! Maybe you could subtly find out. - You should speak to him. - Hmm. Hello there! - Are you father, Paul? - I am. - Good morning to you. - Good morning. I think my colleague, Inspector Jones got in touch with you. That may have been a mistake. I'm an old man. I'm here to talk to you about the Corvid's Head suicides. I don't know anything. I'm not accusing you of anything. I think you might be able to help me. I can provide comfort to the families. That's all! Father, I believe you do know something. It's not the cliff, is it? Father, if you know anything... It's going to be a difficult year. I think every year is a difficult year. But to know that it's something forbidden to go for. What's going on, Brian? Mum, I'm sorry. I can't. Every time I open the door, someone's asking about your photos. Where are you going? Only we could get going. Harmesh, I'm going to take a bath. The Russians strengthen their hoard on Afghanistan sending in more men and equipment and moving deeper into the country. And are in complete control of the capital Kabul and the roads leading to it. ...is in fact in Russia. The Russian invasion force has joined forces with Washington. Till now, there 140, 000 Soviets in Afghanistan. - in another two divisions... Harmesh... Harmesh! - Soumili? - Come here. - Follow me! - Soumili? Come here, Harmesh. Soumili, where are you going? Soumili, please come back. Soumili? Soumili! Soumili, no! Wow! Stop. Come back. Harmesh, come soon! Soumili, listen to me. Come on, yeah! Soumili! - Come back. - Harmesh, hurry up! You still love me? Oh my God! Come here, Harmesh. No! Sou-- Soumili! Soumili! Soumili! Soumili! - No! - What's happening? What? What do you see? Get the cops over to the cliff. Soumili! Hello, Corvid's Head, police station? Who was with him? - Was it you? - Me? - I saw something. - It wasn't me. - I know it was you. - I was just taking pictures. - Come with me. - I didn't do anything. What are you doing? Let me go. It was Soumili Banerjee, whose husband, Harmesh didn't return home last night. He was last seen at the cliff edge over there at Corvid's Head. Police are searching the area as you can see. And with the recent suicides, fresh still in people's minds it's a wonder whether this dangerous cliff edge has taken yet another life. Mrs. Banerjee... I'm so deeply sorry for your loss. It must be an awful shock. We are going to do a thorough investigation. We have our boats out there at the moment. I will keep you updated with any progress. But I must warn you. Because there's high-tide running... ...these things take time. Mrs. Banerjee... He wouldn't do that. Why would he? We are going to investigate. I promise! Did he leave a note or letter, anything? We'll get to the bottom of this. We have two eye-witnesses to help us out with the investigation. But at this point, anything is possible. I'll contact you when I hear more. Commencing the interview with the suspect, Brian Dawson at 11:03. Did you push him? Push... Was that your answer? I must warn you this conversation is being recorded... and maybe used in the court of law. I'll ask you again. Did you push him? Not me! - Not Brian - Well, then who? Brian, how do you know, Was Harmesh going to be at the cliff? Stop that! The interview suspended at 11:05 Thanks for coming. Something happens to Brian. Do you want to follow me? So, we put him in here. Right! - I'll leave you to it. - Thank you. Brian! Brian? Are you confessing to murder? Who are you? Barun? Are you okay? - What happened? - Excuse me! He doesn't look much like a physical threat to me. - He was in distress. - No thanks to you lot. I don't think you understand just how serious this is. Brian is a prime suspect in a potential murder case. What?! Brian, what have you done? Do you have a solicitor? Will I need one? You might do. Come on! Mrs. Banerjee, what's happened? What has to happen around here for you to do your job? What? Eh... Something's wrong in the house. Do you have another break-in? No! Wait! Yes! If that's what it takes. Then, yes! Tell me exactly what you saw, Mrs. Banerjee. Please trust me. I'm very open-minded. I've seen chairs moving by themselves. Cupboards... I don't know how they do it. By-- By strings or... You don't believe me. You don't believe me. I can see it in your eyes. You don't believe me. No, it's not that. I'm just... I know you've been through a lot lately. Look, please sit down. I think there's something I can do. My colleague, Barun Rai, 's an expert in investigating situations like these. Please let me call him for you. Okay. Are you okay? What happened? I don't know. I just-- I just fell. Please... careful! Please sit. Would you like some water? No thank you. Inspector Jones had told me that... you believe in paranormal activities. It's a subject of my interest. Yes! You mean there's something wrong with the house. Haunted? Yes! My husband... Do you know what had happened? I saw him standing on the cliff. I ran towards him from the hotel. But... There... When I got there, he wasn't there. Did you... Did you... see him jump? No, I did not see him jump. Was he alone or... I can't say for sure. Hmm... like I said... when I got there, he wasn't there. And the police are investigating. Let's see. - I think we should wait. - Hmmm. Mrs. Banerjee, the other day you gave me a diary. There are some pictures at the back. Did you see them? No! They said they had not found his body. I feel there's still a chance. What if they're wrong? You said yourself that the police are very certain. If you don't accept that... you simply can't embrace your sense of grief. But I want to know what happened. What was he going through? Why would he do this? Oh! Soumili... Soumili... I am here to take you Soumili... What? What was it? What did you see? The cliff top on Corvid's Head... - near the Banerjees' house. - Yeah! I felt a strange power. Strange... Strange energy there. It felt as if... it's growing stronger! It's gaining confidence. Go on! I saw... dozens of bodies by the shoreline. No! It's as if... this energy, this power, is is waiting for something. Could the sea have something to do with it? When is the next spring tide? It must be in the local papers. Oh, yeah! Ah! It says... Oh, it's this week! - Really? Ma! Ma! We're helping the police with their investigation into... Harmesh's death. Soumili is sleeping. We just wanted to ask her a couple of quick questions. We don't have much time. Ready? Harmesh... - Soumili? Soumili, is that you? Soumili, where are you going? Soumili, please come back, Soumili! Soumili! It's so nice here. Soumili, please stop! Come on. No! So, what did you see? I saw Harmesh running behind someone on the cliff top. Tch... it was Brian, right? No... I think it was a woman. I... I thought it was Soumili. - Soumili? - Hmm. But then she turned her head around it looked like someone else. But... Soumili told inspector Jones, that she was in the bath at the time. Do you think she was lying? I can't say. But you know what I am thinking? Harmesh was convinced... that whoever it was that he was running behind was Soumili! Are you 100% sure that it wasn't? If Soumili is responsible for Harmesh's death... who is responsible for all the other apparent suicides? When did it all start? I need to find out. All of these men jumped. But only one woman. Polly Shlonvick, she was the first. Is she the shadow in the photos? Could she be the one? She was supposed to marry, Alexander. - Hello? - Hello, Sukhbir. Yeah, Barun. Could you make any sense of the diary? Yeah, the diary talks about Alexander, a lot. But it was written by someone whose name isn't obvious. I think it begins with a "P." And you won't believe this. He cheated on her. She was supposed to marry Alexander. Polly! Polly! It looks like she's written a curse on all men. I see. Listen to this. "The price of the betrayal will be heavy." "The price of the betrayal is mine to take." "I will not rest until vengeance has been won." "All men who dare cross my path... "will suffer for the pain bestowed on me by my betrayal." Polly! She was betrayed by her fiance. And so she's been taking it out on the men of Covid's Head. I guess is she wants to get into the house on the cliff. What's this? This book! Again? Not me! Not Brian! - We need to get Soumili out of there. - Okay, sure! - Yeah, go around there. Will you? - Okay, I'll do it. Okay. Soumili! Soumili! - Is there anyone in? - No! I tried, but... It seemed like nobody there. - Do you want me to wait? - No. Why don't you go back to the hotel? Be by the phone. Keep an eye on this place. If you see anything wrong, call the cops. Okay? Do you have the diary? Yeah! Here. Great, thank you. - Come on. - But where do you going? To get back up. Father Paul. I already told you. I don't know anything. You knew Alexander. And Polly was a member of your Parish. I'm sorry, Mr. Rai. I'm busy organizing the church service. Did you know, Polly wrote about you in her diary. It was Polly at the house the other day. Wasn't it? You two were really close? Weren't you? Did she speak to you? At the house? Father, this is really important. Soumili's life is in danger. And now with this moon... if you know anything about how to appease this spirit please help me. Guide me. Father... She's already too powerful. There's nothing we can do. Have you dealt with any such spirits before? So, what you are saying is that... you're prepared to let Soumili die. There must be something we can do. I'm sorry, Mr. Rai. Nothing at all. You loved Polly once. You don't know anything. Please leave. If not for Soumili... come for Polly. Set her free! Yes. This inspector... he's very determined. We need to do something. I can't. The last time I tried... I virtually lost my legs. I'm worried about Brian. With good reason Brian is listening every time the demon calls him. He is not totally in the demon's possession. There's no telling what he might command him to do. What about Soumili? Soumili? Do you mean Polly? This is about her? Please... guide me! Father Paul, we are dealing with a vengeance demon. A very powerful one! Pervu Novak! Every time he takes a life... he grows more powerful. And now, he's almost got control of Polly! If a ghost that has wronged in life is drawn to it. What will happen to Polly? I feel the demon is using her to get into the... the house! What did you say? Have you laid eyes on Polly? Yes. - And? - Rotten! Decomposed shell. I see! You're right, father Paul. The demon is looking for a new host. Yes... If Soumili and Polly... become one on the blood-red-moon there's no telling what its strength would be. It could kill us all. We will be in great danger. All of us! We must save, Soumili. We must do it quickly, father Paul. God be with you. Now! What is it? The first commandment. Breaking the first rule. Will he forgive me? Father Paul, we both knew this day was going to come about. You have to make a sacrifice. God be with you. Now go! I would set no vile things before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. I will have nothing to do with evil. He who practices deceit... won't be allowed in my house. He who speaks falsehood... won't be established before my eyes. Morning by morning... I would destroy all the wicked of the land. I miss you! Soumili? Open the door, Soumili. Soumili! Harmesh? Harmesh? Remember me? Remember me? Oh, my God! Remember me? Harmesh, wait. Harmesh, where are you going? Harmesh? Stop playing games, Harmesh. Harmesh? Harmesh, please! Harmesh, please! Are you here? Soumili! Harmesh? Soumili! What are you doing? - Barun... - Father, you are here. What's happened to your head? You're bleeding. The sofa came out of the way and hit me. Forget that. How do we get in? The door is locked. Okay. There's a basement here. After you, father. It's out there. It's waiting for us. Don't look at her. Draw a circle around me We pray to thee our God this day. I will set no vile things before my eyes. I will have nothing to do with evil. Oh, please! The power of Christ compels you. It's my house! He who speaks falsehood. Won't be established before my eyes. Morning by morning Morning by morning. Morning by morning. Morning by morning. Barun, why are you doing this to me? Please save me. I'm scared. - Help me! I can't bear it. - Soumili? I hate the deeds of faithless men. Dare you not... I told you that burn. He who speaks falsehood. Won't be established before my eyes. - Morning by morning - You have to fight it. - I will destroy all the wicked of the land - Fight it, Soumili. - Fight it. - I will have nothing to do with evil. He who speaks falsehood. Won't be established before my eyes. Soumili, you have to fight it. Won't be established before my eyes. Won't be established before my eyes. I will not leave her! Get out! Only when she becomes one. And you can call the devil by its name. Leave its host. May the holy cross be my light. May the devil never be my guide. Be gone, Satan! Barun, you must get Polly out of Soumili. Use the diary. Sacred water... Write me down, the devil. Give me all you have. Let me feel your power. Do it! - Do it now! - Pollyanna Take me now! Let me be yours! Barun... Is she okay? Is it over? - Yes, it's over now. - Okay. Easy. All yours, Jenny. Father Paul sacrificed himself for the sake of the village. And got rid of the negative energy. Harmesh has not been found. But at least my efforts have amounted to something. Soumili will have the chance to start a new life. Now I too must move on to where I'm needed next. Until then... You're listening to the Radio Morning News. Corvid's Head, the UK's former suicide capital... had reported no new deaths for over a year now. Police are confident that the explosion of killings or suicide that took place here are all in the past. And as for the local villagers the infamous story of the house on the cliff is now no more than an anecdote.
