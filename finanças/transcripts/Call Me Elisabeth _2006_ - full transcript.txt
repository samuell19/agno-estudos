Based on the novel by Anne Wiazemsky MY NAME IS ELISABETH At the time, everybody used to call me Betty. I was 10 years old. It was a very long time ago. This is how my story begins. Do you really think it's haunted? It's been sold many times and all the owners died of a violent death. Shall we try and go inside? Maybe it's not a good idea. We won't be able to. Wait! Wait, Agnès! Agnès, wait for me! Agnès! Agnès! Wait! Agnès, wait for me! Agnès! Agnès, wait! Agnès! SAINTE LUCIE INSTITUTION Agnès? Agnès! You saw it, too. The door suddenly opened. Being scared of a door is really stupid. Let's go back. We'll see what happens. I'd love to, but Mom is waiting for me. Aren't you leaving tomorrow? No, now. I'll be back this weekend. I've already told you that. That's not what I understood. - Whatever. I'll go alone. - Where? - To the haunted house. - I doubt it, you're a chicken. Doesn't it feel weird to leave? Not really. I want to make new friends and experience things that... - What? Correspond to my age. You'll always be younger. There are things you don't know about. Do you know what Grandma died of? A broken heart when Grandpa died. No. She committed suicide. She cut her wrists. Agnès, darling! Are you upstairs, girls? I'm coming, Mom! Don't take my clothes. I don't want Rose to be alone. You should stay with her. But... Agnès is leaving. I can't let her just leave like that. We'll say goodbye here. Besides, I'll be back in six days. It's not the end of the world. Give Rose a hand in the meantime. And put your bike away. Can I go get Dad? You can't go into the hospital. It's risky. We'll go to the house together. Can I help you? You know... Agnès is not just my sister. She's also my best friend. Well, she said she was happy to leave. So she could make new friends. That's a bit mean, don't you think? I'll go feed the rabbit. It's me, big daddy. Don't be scared. You're not alone. Oh, it's you. You scared me. You had left the door open. Well, see you tomorrow. Can I eat my dessert when Dad gets back? You better eat it now. You never know with those meetings. There are always endless discussions. Besides, school starts tomorrow. You have to go to bed. Just for once? Everything's "just for once" with you. You're not too sad about Agnès leaving? No. I'm happy for her. - Yoghurt or fruit? - Yoghurt. Hey... Isn't that your bike against the shed wall? Rats! I forgot to put it away. I'll do it now. Dad? You wanted to scare me? No, I was putting my bike away. - I suppose Agnès is gone. - Yes. You're surely going to miss her. Not really. Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man, bake me a cake as fast as you can... Do you believe in haunted houses? Why are you asking me that? You know, the abandoned mansion behind the lake. We were there with Agnès. The door was closed, and in the blink of an eye, it was wide open. Agnès says there's a logical explanation. But I'm afraid a ghost might have come out and will soon get here. You should let me know before embarking on such expeditions. You could have had an accident and we'd have never found you. I think your sister is right. Either the door was already open... - which you didn't notice - or it opened by itself. Or maybe someone opened it to scare you away. And they succeeded. That's probably the case. I have to go. Let me know the next time you go to a haunted house. You cut your face. There. Now, we're not only father and daughter, we're also blood brothers. You can no longer lie to me, and I can no longer lie to you. Alright, go. Have a nice day! Next year, most of you will go to different middle schools in the region. You've known each other since kindergarten. But this year, we're welcoming Quentin, who comes from Réunion Island. Did you see? That's weird! Shh! Since we are going to learn about magma and volcano activity, Quentin will tell us about the Peak of the Furnace eruption. I hope you will behave this year. I hope Samantha will arrive on time now and again. I also hope that if a classmate says that the Great Bear is the biggest grizzly bear ever captured, Betty will be smart enough not to write the exact same thing in her Science test. Right, Betty? Alright. Open your notebooks... Write the date on the first page. Did you see lava coming out of the volcano? Yes. Is lava actually... Is it fire? It's red-hot magma. The center of the Earth is made of magma. Actually, the Earth is a dying sun. - Is the Sun going to die, too? - Of course. It's just a matter of time. Hello, Nuts. You didn't think I'd abandoned you, did you? So, miss... Are you finally going to take... "Nuts" with you? Well... I can't right now. I'm on my bike. I don't have money for vaccines. But my father will come. I'll put that dog down at the end of the week. I can't keep waiting. He will come. Don't worry. I'll sort it out. Mom! Mom? Isn't Mom here? "Betty, your mother is busy and I have to stay at work. "Rose will make dinner and stay with you. I love you. Dad". You know what? You and I are going to eat together in my room. Alright? I have one week to convince Dad about the dog. Then, it will be too late. I know I can make him change his mind. I just have to stop talking about it for a couple of days. I don't know how he is a doctor, but as a father, he's a little bit... not complicated, but he's not easy either. Can I try? That door is never closed. I used to believe there was a ghost in the attic. Isn't that silly? You can have my bed, Rose. Rose? Rose? Don't be scared. I'm here. Betty? I'm here, Dad. What are you doing in the dark? Betty, are you OK? Rose is a bundle of nerves. What happened? Everything was fine until she started looking at my teddy as if it was Dracula. Let me tell you something about Rose. If she were a threat for you, I wouldn't let her work here. I know, but she's a bit weird anyway. Even Mom is scared of her. She shouldn't be. She knows nothing. Rose experienced a trauma. She crossed a country in war with her dead children in a wheelbarrow. She forgot everything. The only thing that gets her out of her apathy is working in a house, cooking and doing the chores. Rose was so scared that she lost her mind. Is that it? In a way, yes. There you are. I thought this was Sleeping Beauty's castle. - Did you have a good day? - I sure did. What do you do in town? Work? No. I take time for myself. How was your first day in school? There's a kid with a big birthmark on his face and neck. Nobody talks to him apart from me. Did you have dinner? Me neither. Agnès and you like to play table football. I came across a bar that was being renovated. They were getting rid of a table football, so I bought it. We'll put it in the shed. Great! It's late. Read a little and then go to sleep. Come on. - Dad... - Yes. Is it true that the Earth is an old dying sun? - Yes. - There's nothing we can do? It takes billions of years. It's not even discernible. But it's unavoidable. Come on. Sleep tight! - You never did anything else. - Like what? Macramé? I gave up my career as a pianist to come to this asylum. You chose to do so. You shouldn't have. I'm not the only one to blame, so don't blackmail me. If it wasn't for Betty, I wouldn't even be here. If this continues, I'll leave. It's useless. We're running in circles, hurting each other. Try to sleep. Get some sleep? I'm going for a walk. Agnès? Agnès, are you asleep? No, I was thinking. Did you hear? You will never go to boarding school, Betty. If you leave the house, Mom will go away. Dad will be miserable. Yes, I know. Who cares, anyway? One day, the Sun will go out. It will be dark forever. Is Mom going to town today? Probably, yes. But she'll be here tonight, don't worry. I'm not worried. Are you worried? No, that's not like me. Would you tell me if you were? Yes. Yes, of course. Liar. What's on your mind? A patient sneaked out last night. I hope we'll find him safe and sound this morning. Come, come. Quick. Come inside. Aren't you sick of people asking if it's contagious? Well... I'm used to it. The kids here are rather nice. What do your parents do? Mi father is a mailman. My mother's a nurse. She works at Sainte-Lucie. Sainte-Lucie? She works with my father, then. Is he a nurse? No, he's the director. I have a secret that I can't tell anyone. But if you become my friend, I'll tell you. You see this key? It opens a door. Only I know what's behind it. Do you want to know a secret? This is not a birthmark. A sorcerer cast a spell on me. Fortunately, there's an antidote. But it's not easy to get hold of it. I need help. Do you want to know what it is? Children, playtime's over. At midnight, when it's full moon, you have to... It might sound weird, but there are weirder things in witchcraft. The doctor's daughter. Betty. Call me Betty. I won't say anything, don't worry. Wait. This is the dining room. The bedroom. Hi, Rose. I'll feed the rabbit and then I'll set the table. He didn't eat yesterday. I'll bring him some things he likes. This is my snack. Don't worry, Rose. I'll help you. The doctor's daughter. Betty. You can call me Betty. My real name is Elisabeth. But everybody calls me Betty. What's your name? Sit down. I brought you something to eat. I can't stay. My parents are on their way home. But I will bring you a candle later. I'll take good care of you, you'll see. I thought you never drank whisky after dinner. Well, this is cognac. And you should have done your homework earlier. Looks like everybody's acting weird in this house. I guess it was Rose who broke my mother's crystal carafe? No, it was me. How did it happen? I took it down. It wasn't on purpose. - What for? - To fill it with water. - Seven years of bad luck. - Really? No. That's for broken mirrors. Shall I try to glue it? It's in smithereens. Not everything's fixable, right? Aren't you asleep? No. Are you alright, Mom? Yes, I'm fine. Let's say we've been through more... peaceful times. I wanted to tell you that you mean the world to me, Agnès and you. I'll always be there for you. And for Dad, too? Yes, of course. There's something... - Did you know a madman escaped? - Yes, your dad told me about it. Is he dangerous? No. According to your father, he's dangerous for himself. What do you mean? He did... He tried... Listen, your father doesn't want to mix work and private life. He's right. Sleep tight, Betty. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'll come back on Thursday to be with Betty and I'll stay for the weekend. What am I going to say to Betty? You don't have to tell her I'm with someone, but don't lie to her. Tell her I needed some space... You're the shrink. You're leaving the shrink? Among others. Let's start from scratch. I've begun another relationship. I want to see what it leads to. It's alright... I'm here. Betty. That's right. I didn't think about that. You hold it in all day long. Go, hurry. Come back, madman. Don't go. Stay with me. Don't go. Stay with me. Don't go, don't go. Stay with me, don't go. Come on, get inside. You have to eat now. Take this. It's really good. It's full of vitamins. My mother's left. I don't think she'll come back. My father wants to start from scratch. But my mother wants to see another relationship through before coming back to him. Do you understand? I mean... First, my sister. Then my mother leaves. When you went outside, I thought you'd never come back. Here, you'll be better with this. I'm going to bed, too. I'll leave you the key in case you need to go out. Double-lock the door when you're inside. Don't open to anyone but me. I will knock like this, and I'll say: "It's me, Betty". Alright? Betty. Lock the door. Lock the door! I don't want to insist, but my dog... Stop going on about that. This is not a good time. Are you worried about the madman? Have you found him? No. - What's his name, by the way? - Yvon. Why was he locked up with the crazy people? I hate mixing my work and my private life. I'm at home now. This isn't the hospital. When you set yourself a rule, you must stick to it. Right? Yes. It's not like promises. It's me, Betty. Come on, open up! It's me! It's me! Open the door! I'm going to be late. Please, Yvon! I'll bring you a sweater later. The coffee is cold. Heat it up with the candle. During the day, I better keep the key. What hand? Left. No luck. You dropped it in the playground. Give it to me. - Come on! - What's your secret? Give it to me! OK, on one condition: you'll give me the antidote. Betty! That's good, Gregory. At midnight? At midnight, at full moon. You can't be late or it won't work. Betty! Alright, you have my word. Where's your father? He's not here? Then go back to where you came from. Just five minutes? It's closed. If your father doesn't come get him, your doggie... Do you know who my father is? He runs a mental institution. If you put my dog down, he will lock you up! Yvon? Yvon? You attempted suicide too. Like my grandma. Come. Look. This is for you. Here. Put it on. It's the sweater. It's his cologne. He doesn't know you're here. Don't be afraid. Who has the key of the shed? We usually put it... here, in the flower pot. My daughter must have... - It's locked. - Is there a spare? Not that I know of. - I'm coming. - Are you there? What are you doing here all alone? I was imagining how this place would be when it's empty. Have you seen anybody around? No, I haven't seen anyone. - Is the madman dangerous? - He's not a violent boy. Two years ago, there was a circus. A puma ran away. They said he was sweet as lamb. But it's a wild animal. Three days, no food... I don't think they're comparable. Oh, geez! I forgot my coat. Sorry, doctor, but this man attacked his mother with a knife... Let's assume it was just a moment of madness. He's not taking any pills. Could he...? He could have headaches, hallucinations, depression, but he's not going to... He's not a criminal. Rose! Don't be afraid. Rose! Come here. It's OK, they're leaving. It's over. You were scared, huh? I think I'll go to bed now. Already? But there's no class tomorrow. Don't you want to play Mikado with me? Alright. Betty? Is that you? Yes. Where are you going? I can't sleep. Me neither. Is it because of Mom? Are you scared she won't come back? I know she'll come back. I have no doubt about it. She just needs to distance herself for a while. Like Agnès and me. Something like that. I promised I wouldn't insist but... - The dog. - Yes. We'll have a dog when things get back to normal. I already have a dog, in a shelter. Seriously. We'll buy a puppy from a breeder. You never know. It can be dangerous. Especially for a child. Then we wouldn't have Rose but a normal cleaning lady. You can't compare humans to animals. We should go back to bed. If the Earth is an old dying sun that will go out in millions of years, it's possible that by then we'll have found another planet. Perhaps. Maybe all the people we loved that died, like Grandpa and Grandma, are already there. Yes, maybe. Grandpa used to sing À la claire fontaine. Remember? Will you sing it to me? Yvon! It's me, Betty. I brought you some hot coffee. Betty. I don't have class today. Let's have a nice little breakfast. And then, I'll show you some pictures of my sister. If you stop shivering, we can play Mikado. Otherwise, I'm going to win every time. I'm sorry. I couldn't come last night. My father couldn't sleep. I think he's afraid that Mom will never come back. If she chooses to live with another husband, other children maybe, it'll be sadder than if she were dead. Betty. Elisabeth. If you were the only one to call me that, I would like it. Stop doing that, you'll hurt your eyes. Look. If you keep on pushing them in, this is what will happen. They'll fall inside. Betty, are you there? Are you in the shed? I forgot Mom was coming to get me! You have to hide. - Betty? - I'm here! You're having a picnic all alone? No, I'm not alone. You're too old to play with dolls, especially a broken doll, in the dark. It's a little bit sad. You know what? We'll throw everything out, so we can prepare the playroom. Mom? Rose! Please, calm down. Give me that shovel. It'll be alright. Give it to me. Everything's OK. There you go. We'll throw it away. Give it to me. That's right. Calm down. We'll go inside. Come on, let's go. I'm going to lock you in. I won't let them clean the shed. See you tonight! - I look like Mary Poppins. - Why Mary Poppins? I feel like dancing. Can I keep it on? Well, well! You used to hate shopping! That's because we were always with Agnès. She managed to have the most girly clothes. See, that's good. In the future, we'll go shopping. It will be our time together. Mom? I have to tell you something. There's someone in my life. You met him at school? I can't tell you now, but... I will, someday. I look like a real girl! - Dang. - I saw that. Will Rose come back? Of course. Nothing has changed. On the contrary. It's important for her. She didn't want to act that way. She feels anxious and she doesn't know how to express it. Do you like the crazy people? What do you mean? Do you really like them or is it just part of your job? I really like them. They're totally defenseless in life. I like them too. Dad... I think I'm going to go crazy. Why do you say that? I'm completely defenseless, too. Because you're very sensitive and also... very impressionable. And you have lots of imagination. You're not crazy. You have nothing to fear. Trust me. I touched. Come on, it's your turn. You're not focused tonight. It's the first time you let me win! - Here. - You're right. - I'm going to bed now. - I'm going, too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sweetie. I went to the shed. I didn't find the key. Put it back. Someone's coming to empty the shed. They'll need the key. Sleep tight. Yvon, I have bad news. You can't stay here any longer. You have to go. I have a plan. I'll walk you to the intersection. Then, you'll walk straight to the village. You'll take the first shuttle to Lyon. And the train to Marseille. Once there, go to the port. It's quiet there. The people are nice and you can sleep on the beach. Look. I think there's enough for your trip. Alright, this is it. See the stars? We have to separate now, Yvon. I'll go home. You have to walk straight to the bus station. I noted everything down for you. There's also my name and address. Put it in your pocket or you'll lose it. I'm going to miss you. Here. You'll need it more than I do. Keep it. It's yours now. - Yes. - Can I have a word? Sit down and stay focused. I'll be right back. Do you have it? - What is it? - He made her believe his mark was a curse that could be broken with pee drops. Provided she peed at midnight, at full moon. And Betty believed it! Betty believed it! Betty believed it! Betty believed it! Betty believed it! Betty believed it! Betty? What are you doing? Daydreaming? Thinking about important things. Tell me... it looks serious. A matter of life or death. Tomorrow is the last day to go and get Nuts. No, Betty. No. Who'll take care of him? You wanted the playroom. Now what? The dog? - You can't have everything! - The playroom, you have no idea... You just don't understand! Betty! Betty? Rose? Are you upstairs? She's coming! I'll stay in my room. Don't worry about me, Rose. "Dad, Mom and Agnès, "I'm sorry if I make you sad, "but I'm going to meet Grandpa, Grandma and Nuts". Yvon? Wait, I'm coming! - Hello, Yvon. - Betty! I'm happy to see you. Look, I made an attempt, too. Shall we go? Wait. Look. I won't take it from you. There. It's us, Nuts! I can't! Come here, Nuts. - Hurry! - Hey! Where are you going? Hey! Come quick! We'll go to the woods. Otherwise, he'll catch us. I know an abandoned house. Don't worry. It's not far. Yvon, I think we're lost. Goodnight, Yvon. Goodnight, Nuts. It's OK, we're getting closer. It's right behind the lake. Nuts! Come here! See those trees over there? One more hill and we'll be there. Alright, here it is. This will be the bedroom. There's an open window! Betty! Betty! - She must be inside. - Betty! Betty! Betty! - Betty! - Betty, are you there? I'm here, don't worry! If someone hurt you, there's nothing to fear anymore. What? No one hurt me! He's going to jump! Yvon! Yvon? Yvon! Yvon, don't move. Yvon... Yvon? Come on, Yvon. We have to go inside now. Don't be afraid, Yvon. It's OK, you can come. Come. Come, Yvon. - Come! - Come. Come with us. Yvon... And that's when Dad said: "It's OK. It's over, Betty". And then, I said: "My name is Elisabeth". Subtitles: Eclair Media
