Come on! Your turn. Oh no! He's had it enough, Lekha. He's too frail for that. What a stinker! That's why he was expelled from the previous asylum, too. If he wets the bed again, you tell me right away! I'll beat him up, dripping tap. So, what's your name, bedwetter? Kurbashi... - You shouldn't do that. The Government wouldn't give you another undershirt. You should save this one, so that you look like a human. Not like a pig, got it? Yes. - Do you have parents? Father. - Is he in jail, or an alky? In jail. He's killed my mother. Alright. What else can you do? Save that you're a bedwetter. I can wash socks. Or do the dishes. - Good. You will be washing my socks. If you don't want being beaten again, you come on the dot when I whistle, OK? What else can you do? Sing songs. For real? Come on boy, sing! The nice and joyful future... I plead you to have mercy... I plead you to have mercy... from all my heart I plead. Right from a crystal-clean beginning... to nice and joyful future... to nice and joyful future... I'm going straight ahead. At a boy, you real creep, damn it! Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah! Dear children! I congratulate you on unveiling this memorial bust... to the knight of the revolution Dzerzhinsky. It is well known how very fond Felix Edmundovitch was of children. It is thanks to his tireless concern... that the number of child asylums in our country... has risen greatly! - Hoorah! This is the physics classroom. Well, ask that what's-his-name. We'll fix a TV-set here. This is the gents toilet. - Oh no. Who is it? Horrible! Terrific! I'd rip their hands off, my word! Barbarians! - Nothing sacred for them. This is how your authority is undermined. Look at your portrait. Lyosha, find out quickly who did it! And wipe it off immediately. Why is she so angry? - To hell with her. Go, go all of you! Get out of here. What's the fuss over there? Hey, it's Tamila over there, like that! For real? - No kidding. Why are you standing here? Go wipe it off. No, I don't want... - What's that you're saying? I don't care. If I only say, you'll lick it. Look! He's got high again with pills. I'm flying! He's flying... - I'm flying high... Everything's gonna be OK. - ?h-?h-?h... What is it? - What's happening? You blunderer. Is he dead? - Oh no! Careful! The kids are all around. Don't shout. Olya, bring some milk. - Yes, I will. Oh, I was so afraid! - Where are you going? Calm down, quiet. Calm down, I tell you. Nothing serious. I'm flying... Yes, you are. We're flying together, you and me. I'm flying... - Together we are. I'm flying! Yes, we are flying, we are. Calm down. Flying... Now we're landing. Quiet, cool down. - How is he? He consumed some pills. Well, he's had treatment in a mental hospital before. But in essence he's a good lad, calm and quiet. Olya, Olya! At last, bring the milk. No milk left. Just some kefir, left over after supper. Here we have some kefir left over after supper. Drink some. Drink some more! Vikentiy Mikhailovitch, do you have own kids? Yes, I do. One. Do you want some kefir? - No, thanks. (singing) On the day when... I was sixteen... mother gave me... a knitted jacket. And she removed her eyes... somewhere aside and said... We've got a parcel... that's a gift from daddy. Have no bad attitude to him... when you grow up with years, you'll understand it yourself... So what? Get undressed! Are you shy of anybody? All ours are here. - No, I won't. What? Buck naked! Look, gals! Here's the princess. She's shy of pussies. Your Highness! Would you please take your rags off. Well, it might be you've had no man yet? Get undressed quickly! Give her a blanket party, Faneera. Goo-goo! One butterfly's... making its wings la-la-la... Gals, come, let's have some squatting! A big and warty crocodile was strolling off in town... it was, it was really cucumber-green! Cut it, I say! Hey, hey! Quiet... Oh Jesus, she's kinda kicking it. I was told she had seizures. Sort of psycho? Comfortably numb? Downed. Well, it's gonna be a lot of hassle with her. She'd be better off in the loony bin. Not this place. I did tell him not to swallow it. Now that he's wigged out, they'll crack him up - about benzol, too. We must take the benzol to somewhere else. - When? If we get away now, they'll catch us. Here! Quiet, quiet. - Let me go... What's up over there? Split! What do you want? Our newbie passed out. I'm looking for ammonia. Relax, you chick! Where's your newbie? Who did it? You, Faneera? - Not your business, fuck off! Faneera... - Come out you fool! Wait! She really needs some fresh air. Gals, open up the window. Get her with her head down. I used to ventilate my mom like this, when she was dead drunk. She woke up, raise her! It's alright. Just cold a bit. She made the sleeping room icy cold. Come to me, I'll make you warm. - Are you serious? Back there, we've seen such like you. Do you need anything? No. Beware, Faneera! - Make me. Good nightdreams, my little violets! Screw yourself! Go to hell, caballero. Alright, I remember! Guys, here are dry foods. Bagsy me, I'll act as a waiter. Go ahead! Switch the flashlight off, or they'll see us! A little fir was born in the forest... a tree-stump was aside... he used to wool our little fir like hell every day! Chow time! Biscuits come first, sweets second and bread comes third. Garcon, champagne! - You got it... The fir made head against him, she wanted to go to the dark... Winecups! - You got it... ...and he raped our brave little fir on one so beautiful day. A stump! I was brought to the house as a small kid... get some growing-up there, oh boy! Children's house, children's house... my tiny childhood's album. Good! To you guys! - Come on, to us! Some pickles would be fine now. - Oh it was a nice shot... What's for the snack... - It dropped well If I were born white... mother wouldn't have left me in the clinic. I'd be living now with her. That's the way it is... Why the fuck should she need you? You'd only have bothered her to rave it up. For me, it's all the same if you're black or white or sky-blue pink... Orphans' internationalism. Orphans of the world, unite! And sing "How my mother watched me go" Exactly. My mom wrapped me and left at somebody else's door, with a note... "Please call my son Alyosha" She doesn't care what will happen to me. She only cares about the name. Guys, at times I even think that we are worse than others. But it is not true, is it? We are as clean as any, aren't we? As clean as any, aren't we? As clean as any, aren't we? As any! As any! As any! What are you doing? Are you nuts, motherfuckers? It's not for us. Not for us. Kust, I served a table for you there. - At a boy. Sit down, Lyosha. Yeah... What's in the menu today? - Here's your bread. Dismissed! Where's my big spoon? I need a poor student's sandwich. It tastes good... Aha, here they are! Hey, don't sit there! - Alright. Well, where have you been? Why didn't you sleep in the house? I don't talk when I am eating... But you will have no breakfast at all. Tanya, take it off! I say take it off him! This is discrimination. - Fancy that. What words he knows! You have no right to do it. We'll report a complaint. Yes, but first explain to me... where you rambled around all night through... Don't make it up! - And who did you rob? I'm not making it up. A policeman came up in the morning. What did you do in the kindergarten? Damn it! If anything happens, they all come to us! That's it. You all submit your explanations in writing... And no breakfast for you! Fress it up yourself! Sorry, I didn't mean it. You dispense everything and come to me. - Alright. Aha... Flirting with a boyfriend? At a girl! Well, you'll complete your shift, and go to the isolation ward for the night. You'll know how to behave so wilfully! - Please don't do that. Eat it yourself. What do you want? - We're after used paper. None to share with you. - Sorry. Damned rats sitting in their holes. It's OK, many of them're out at work. Clear. Come on. Watch out! Holy shit! - Almost goofed with it! Go upstairs. Slim pickings... We can't take the TV-set, it's too big. Let's search for money. Well... Marusya, I'm so hungry. - Wash your hands and let's have breakfast. Aha... Masha! Masha! Open up! Let us go! Release us! You can't do it! - Open up! Marusya, we have robbers over there... Let us go! - Call the police. We're no robbers, we're just kids! - No police please! We're no robbers! We're from the asylum! We have no parents! Everyone can hurt us... We are forced to work hard... - We'll never do it again! My mate's gonna faint now. Let us go right away! Let them go, Andron. Release them! For the Christ's sake, let them go! Step aside a bit. Andron, my dear, call the police. Come on, call! Andron, call the police, come on... Make sure you don't shit yourself, dear Andron! Bandits... What shall be done after a good meal by law of Archimedes? Get a sleep? Wrong guess! Take the sun, take the sun, you'll be as black as a negro man! You got it, dumbass, what shall be done? Listen, Ghamal... I want to bet a wish with you. What's to bet? That you can't jump over 2 kopecks. - You say so? No way, you can't! Give me 2 kopecks, I'll walk over them, far from jumping over. Really? Well, go ahead. Here's one kopeck... Now... look... Here's the second kopeck, jump! - You deceived me again. Ghamal, you sound so disrespectfully. You lost... Have to admit! Yes, I lost... You admit it was fair? - Fair it was! You must fulfil my wish, eh? - Yes, I must... Then you go over there... take my shit and drop it down on the people passing by. Are you serious? - Absolutely. Tell it once again. Are you deaf? Take my shit and drop it down on the heads of passers-by! You creep! Come on! Hold on! Now hold on! Come on! What's your name? Tanya. Won't you catch it? Why did you go all out before her? I hate being locked up. It's since I was a small child. Mom used to hide me in the wardrobe while she... - I got it. My mother had a new fucker every month, too. When I left home, she was pregnant. Must have delivered, I guess. So, you have a brother or sister now? No wonder if she abandoned him. Why the heck does she need this drag on? You sound so angry. But she's your mom after all. To hell with such mother... I left them on my own. Her fucker was beating me to death. And she wouldn't give me food just to please him. I'm better off here. Bless me, better off here. Need to go and see how she is over there. I can't get used to living here. I'm home-sick very much. I feel sorry for mom. You know, she's so kind when drunk. Once she held out for very long. She even got to work again. We bought the curtains, and the boots for me. And then - she boozed it all away! Tell me if the gals start bullying you again. You better go now, or they'll catch you. And you? Do you want to sleep? Go to bed. And you? - I'll stay here. All through the night? I'll be with you... Quiet, guys, look out! Ough, he got loaded. Hey, uncle, let's inspect your assets. There. It's mine! Return my bottle! Give it back to me. Hey you assholes, I'll show you right now. Come on, return my bottle. I also had some cash... thirty kopecks. I'll crush you... - Would you like to go to police with us? You'll stay overnight there. Stinking tramp. Claiming the cash, ha, thirty kopecks! Kids, it's no good... No good if children drink wine. Not at all. Look what wine did to me. I used to be a curly good boy, too... Just like you. Yes, like you! How smart you are! - OK, give the bottle back to me. You can as well drink water from the tap. I say give it back! - So long. Bye! Say hello to your grandma. - Kids, wait a bit! Guys, where are you going? Hey, guys! To our hero lover! Give me. Let's do it at last. No hurry. Hey, leave it to me... Pass it to him. To Vovochka! (Singing) Snowfall, snowfall... don't lay your silver on my hair... don't you knock on my door... don't swirl around at my gate... Snowfall, snowfall... if the lady begs for it... there's no hurry at all... to make her summer to pass. There's no rush, snowfall... I am still in no mood... and you've failed... to confuse my soul... Snowfall, snowfall... if the lady begs for it... there's no hurry at all... to make her summer to pass. Make her summer to pass... Let us drink, gentlemen and ladies! To the birthday lady! To her health! Wake up, guys. It's supper time. Yura, hear me, Yura! Wake up, come on. Split. - Get up. Slavik, Slavik. Get up, we've landed, my boy. Come on, on your feet! Leave me for a while more. Let him get landed. Ghamal. Wakey! Ghamal! Time to go home. Hey! Get up. Hey, Ghamal! Lyosha! Lyosha, Kust! - What's up? What is wrong with him? Listen... Ghamal, come on, get up. Cut it, Ghamal... Ghamal. It's over... End of the game. Have it coming. What the fuck? What are you doing? Why, you want to go to jail? He doesn't care where to lie. Why are you sitting idle? Help me! Carefully. A little fir was born in the forest... Shut up! This is it. Let's go now. Slavik, get up. Come on, go-go. Yura, Yura! Please don't look back there! Go! Go out of here. Remember, once we were together, and then... somebody else came up. - Yes. Well, I must go! - Eh, why not to stay a bit more? Where you say? - Here is your handbag. I'm gonna see you off. No, no! I can handle it. - Don't be late tomorrow. I won't. What is it? Don't leave the lady alone... Ah, I got it. So, what do we have here? Wow! The fuses have blown out. - Yes... Dark as in somebody's... I must go to fix it... - Don't, we wouldn't shoot wide. And what is it here? Let me... Oh no, please, no... - Why not? Oh Vikenty... Yura, Yura! Are you asleep? No, I'm not. I'm scared. What if he comes, eh? Bullshit. - You two, shut up! Let's go out to have a smoke. We must bury him... We can't appear there again, no! Well... Shall I go? Yes, of course. Thank you. Everything was good. Don't be late tomorrow. I'll make my best not to. Well, my friends. Where's Ghamal? What do you have to say? You seem to have been inseparable. Well? We know nothing. Why do you say for the others? Why me? Let them speak out. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. OK, you can go. What do you think, Vikenty Mikhailovich? No idea. May he be at his mom's place? For example. If so...he would... have warned us, and as far as I remember he's been out of touch with his mother. However... Hello. - Hi. Look, I am a housemaster from the orphanage. And... Ghamal... - I have no son... I disowned him long ago. Clear? Yes, I understand that you disowned him. But the thing is that... when a kid breaks away, he normally runs to his parents and... here I am looking for him... Go on. It's your headache, not mine! Yes, I understand, that it is our task to look for him. Well... Good luck... ...in your lofty business. What do you know about me, housemaster? I was 16 when I was expelled from the Komsomol. I was thrown out from the school. I was denied any job. I had nothing to eat! I know that my track record doesn't excite you very much. I wasn't a builder of the communism. I agree you were pursuing your personal goal. So I am in my own right... to sell what belongs to me personally. Yes, I can see you do. I don't mind. Oh my birdie... Oh shit! Faneera, my dear, I beg you! May I not come along? Please, do not force me. I'll tell nothing to anybody, honest! Bye, bye love my baby's leaving me... now lonely teardrops are all that I can see... but I'm a fuckin' fag... don't want to walk with you. I'll tell nobody, my word! Please don't you press on me! Faneera, please! Why are you scared? It's our former boy from the house. He was expelled, but still a good mate. He's gonna feed you and then rub your back in the bathroom. Where do you imagine we get our tights? From the housekeeper lady? Haven't you done this before? Well, he's a cool man. You won't regret it. Why are you not coming? We've got it under control. No. I'm not coming. What a surprise! Yes, you are. No way out. Listen to me. If you refuse to go... we'll give you a good thrashing again. Be aware of that. We'll do it every night. Please consider. Our Tanya weeps so loud... she let the ball to river down... Quiet Tanya don't you cry... or you'll go there like a fly. Keep walking, you fool... Faster! What, are your feet trembling? Full steam ahead! - I don't want to go! Why are you so stubborn? Go, go, my kitty. Hi! What a lucky meeting. To you from us. Big respect. I've warned you, Faneera, not to mix the newbie in your net. None of your business! Fuck off! Go to hell. She asked herself to join. She says she likes this awfully, take me on please! Stupid! My only tights. Kill the bastard! Go to hell, idiot! Creep! Let's go... I'll show you, motherfucker... Are you OK? It's alright, I'm OK. Wow... top class! Get on! I'm afraid. Put it back where it was. Get on. We'll take a ride and get it back. Nearly three days have passed. We must report to the police, put him on the wanted list. What else do they need? They are given meal and clothes here. Truly said... You can give the wolf the best food, but he would hanker for the wood. You know what is remarkable? That we are not America. Still not. Black boys are rare here. He'll turn up some day. Don't worry. But the boys do know something... They do and they hide it. Sasha, pull. Stop it. Misha, a bit to the left. That's it. Down. No, more. More to the front. Pull! Turn it around, right. Come on, come on here. That's normal. To the left. Some more. One-two-three. Yura! Hey, assholes, where are you going! Listen. I'd like to ask you about Ghamal. Understand? Kust! Won't your ears drop off of exertion? No! - You sure? Then go help Sasha. Come on, quickly. Let's have a chat. You keep going. Well? Listen. I visited Ghamal's mother. And his friends. He didn't show up. Where do I come in? - But you do. If you need him, you go search for him! Ough, you stink of smoke. Haven't you been mates with him? You all were friends. So what? - Why? If you're not in the know, who is? So... Dear mates. If I'm unable to find him, and you, his mate, have no idea about him... it means something happened to him? Could anything happen to him, Yura? No slightest idea, it's your hassle. - May we search for him together? Here I am! Hey, Ghamal... Ghamal! Where's Ghamal? Ghamal! No Ghamal here... Ghamal! - Can you make it even louder? Ghamal! He's not there. - Ghamal! No Ghamal. Where is Ghamal? Dunno. - Would you tell me anything else? In secret? He's left to Africa as a hitch-hiker. Look, Yura. You must understand me correctly. If you and me don't find Ghamal... we're bound to go to Africa ourselves. But not as hitch-hikers. Go. They won't find him, Tamila Aleksandrovna. Don't worry. - What if they will? Why didn't you tell me before? Don't you understand that we are accomplices. Oh Lord! Just keep your mouth shut. You hear me? Whoever asks you, hold your tongue! While I'll try to find a way out. You don't want to go to the colony, do you? (Chanting) A small boy found a rope... he brought it with him right to his school... city hall people laughed aloud very much, as the bald school director hang in the gents. Good! Perform some more. - I dunno what else? Give me. Tamila, don't turn on the electric saw, 'cause I'm sitting on it. Look what I have. Where did you find this? - In the bedside chest. Take it away. I can't see it. - Let me see what it is. Forget about this, got me? Are you nuts? - I said forget about this. Let's go. We're screwed now... You must be kicked away, all of you! Right, Marta Kazimirovna, we deserve it! Stop talking drivel. You better think how to get out of this shit. Who was on duty when it happened? Vikentiy... - ?h, Vikentiy! Then let him have all the big time. Dear Marta, we must cover him somehow. You know, he's out the game, I swear! Is it that you sleep with him? - No way! No... Did he promise to marry you? Tamila... Tamila, I know you perfectly well. Yes or no? Yes or no? This is very important. Yes or no? Well, yes actually. - I am asking you... What yes-yes? You bimbo... Couldn't you have dined out? You must have used your brains. Look, that black boy... Yes? - Wasn't he oligophrenic? Oh no! Otherwise he'd have been in a different house. Shucks, he ain't no baron. Could as well be ours. Listen... Take his medical record book... - Yes. And make two new entries there. Oh no, impossible! We can't let other people into it. OK. You will go to the police today... and declare him on the wanted list. They're gonna search for him for a long time. You know our police perfectly well... Remember last year... what's his name? Fe-fe-fe... Fetisov? - Yeah, sort of that. How long did they keep him on the wanted list? Almost a year. - One year! And then he came up to them on his own. - Yes indeed, on his own! And how long will it take them to find our black boy? Alright... What's important... we have new promotions soon. With certificates of honour. We need to win the time. Remember that we know nothing - both of us. Nothing at all! - And we will cover Vikentiy... One more thing. Your hoodlums, could they somewhere... let it out as it happens? - No, they're scared themselves. You are telling me... Kids are the worst traitors. You know what I will do? Well? - I'll transfer them to the detention center. When it's all over... I'll have them dispensed among other institutions, eh? Well said! A good idea. - Alright then. Look, it's great. But you also make sure that nobody... has suspicions that the three boys at a time, you know... It must be thought over very carefully... Tamila Aleksandrovna... - Shut the door! Don't you ever shout at kids! You know what. You are having... a celebration party tonight. Brace yourself. So, you're gonna... look as if nothing happened, nothing. Do you read me? Take this off. You're not a teenager girl. Oh come on! - Put on decent clothes. Bye bye. Happy holiday! - Idiot. Quiet, quiet. Dear children! My congratulations with this good holiday! You must remember that you ought to... study and learn well, to become good members of our society. I knew that you'd come... Remember, I was in your dreams? You called me... Come. Come to me. Yulia Petrovna... Good day. How is your son? What? Why, yes, of course. I spoke to the dean. He's a very heartful man. We all used to be young. We all did stupid things. Ah, this it simply trifle. Yulia Petrovna! Concerning... vouchers to Artek. Yes, we've talked about that. Why, only three? Just three? For kids from the orphanage. Yulia Petrovna, I'm not asking for myself. Yes, sure, I'll call him. I will. I appreciate very much, Yulia Petrovna! Many many thanks. All the best. Freeze, Faneera. You again! I've no time. - Wait. Well, what do you want? Save it, come on! What do you want? - Look... Faneera, could you fall in love with me? No way! Tamila's stooge! Asshole! - Wait. Kiss! Please kiss me! Let me go! You creep! Cut it! Come again if you wanna kiss me! Fucking sleazeball. Son of bitch! Fima! Could you fall in love with me? Go to ass! Hey, why are you pushing people like that? Stop! Wait I said! I was allowed off to go home for holidays! I stayed here because of you. - And me too because of you. My goodness! Why are we sitting here then? Fools we are! Let's go. Why to wait? Come. Hey, what are you doing hooligan! We must call Vikentiy Mikhailovich! Call Vikentiy Mikhailovich. Fall out! Lyokha, drop the chair. Back off! - Drop the chair I say. Don't get rough. Don't get rough, clear? Watch a beasty boy. - I'll kill you! Let's talk a bit in a normal way. Calm down. Calm down. - Let me go! Everything's normal. Quiet, like this, don't move. It's over! I made a deal with the detention center. They're coming to get you. Over. That's not a good idea. We could settle it down ourselves. Yes, yes, Lyokha? That's it. Stand normally. You think you scared an elephant with your prick? - Hold still. Shut up, bastard! - Why you calling bad names? Lyokha, hold your tongue. Don't you solicit for him, Vikentiy Mikhailovich. - I don't. Look what you did, you filthy creature. Enough. He's too dangerous for the house. You know, Tamila Alexandrovna, we ain't no angels with you, either. Why the heck did you crack down on him? We should maintain peace in the home by all means. We should do it, got it? - Are you serious? - Yes, I am! What a one you are. Pray that they are unaware of your tricks over there. Vikentiy Mikhailovich! Please do something. Help me please. I beg you to do something! Yes? - That's me. Hello, Marta Kazimirovna. I've got three vouchers to Artek resort for you... You can send the kids off after the holidays. But now we only need two vouchers. Oh Marta Kazimirovna, we've had an incident here! We sent Lyosha Kust to the detention center. Eh, all the better. But if anything crops up... I discussed nothing like that with you. You got me? - Yes, of course! Sure, Marta Kazimirovna, sure. Goodbye. - So long. I can't. I can't any more. No more nerve. Damn this job. I can't no more. I'm quitting. Quitting. There's nothing human in it. If only I could... (Song) We've been alone in entire world... days and nights were full of happiness... you sang for me and named me your destiny, how sweet it was to be beside you. You had no idea, darling, and I was unaware... that even eternity would be too small for both of us... Young people, why're you out there in the cold? Come to the cabin, it's warmer there. We are OK. Forgive me, please... She's had it well enough! Now she's repenting her sins before her Johnny. Shall we come to my place? No way. What if he begins beating her? Then, shall I stay with you? You can go, I can handle it. Alright, see you. - Bye. Vasya! My darling! I'm guilty, yes I am! Forgive me. Beat me if you like. Beat me but not leave me alone. Darling, I beg you! - Go away. You're my joy! - What the fuck are you doing, bitch! If you want, I'll hang myself! If you want, I'll jump out of the window! Mom, hello! You're whore, bitch! Mom, hello. Oh my dear daughter, Tanya. You are my joy! Come to me, my sweetie. My beauty has come to me. Calm down, ma. - My beautiful girl. My honey! I'll sweep it up all over here. And I'll walk you to bed. Calm down. What a daughter, ah! She'll do it out and walk me to bed. Shut up. And she'll get shopping. - Shut up, you badass! I'll get you to bed - with whom though? Don't touch her, she's so drunk. Yura! Didn't you recognize me? Well, I almost forgot your face. Come in. Are you about to deliver again? - Stop kidding, don't you see yourself? This is my husband these days, Gosha. And this is my son, Yura. - Wow! Sit down, young boy. Sit. Mother, give a plate to the boy. He's sure hungry as a wolf. Let us drink, Yura, to welcome company. No! - Why not? - Water will do. Good choice. At a boy! He's gonna be a good lad. Alright, mother, let's drink for two. To your sonny... To him. Ready? (Sings) And motherland plied me a lot... with birch sap, with birch sap. (singing) I know my darling, I know what's up with you... you've lost yourself, yes you have... you left you homeland's shore... You amaze me, mom! Why can't you buy a decent bed for the small one? What? What are you talking about? You've come to teach your mother? If you came, you just keep sitting. Like a man. Eat all this... we spare nothing... Housewifing? Mom is asleep at last...
