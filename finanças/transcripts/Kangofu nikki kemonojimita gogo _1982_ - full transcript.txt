No doubt about it. It is complete, Isogai-kun! Congratulations, Doctor! With this, I can enter the dream world! Something that even Freud and Jung were unable to accomplish! Nurse Diary Beast Afternoon I'm freezing... Heating Pack It's not cold, it's not cold! This is the best... Reiko-chan... I'm on fire now... Ow! That hurts! Why's it so hot?! Hold still! You'll tear my dick off! Don't move, Reiko! Let me pull out! Doc, hurry... A devil. Blood. A bat. You have a bad case of genophobia, I see. I recommend a week's hospitalization. Tachibana Clinic "Experimentation underway" Hypnotherapy Room Doctor, what is that? - A Dream Ring. - Dream Ring? This ring is equipped with a microcomputer and special sensors. It's a dream playback device created at this clinic that will make us world-famous. - It plays back dreams? - Yes. Women dream with their wombs. No way... For your treatment, we need to use this ring to psychoanalyze your dreams. - We'll really be able to see them? - Please hold still. How is the ring coming along? - Good morning, Chairwoman, Dr. Katsuragi. - Good morning. I've just finished. There's nothing to be ashamed of. In the past year, that ring has allowed this clinic... ...to free a great many women from their sexual troubles. Sakakibara-kun, you're in the best of hands with Dr. Akizuki. No... No! Hypnotism experiment a success. Patient fell completely under my control with the sound of a bell. Am I nuts? Why did I have to dream about that Dr. Katsuragi guy of all people? That dream makes me want to puke. Come in. Good morning, Reiko-chan. Here's a present for the patient. It's nice that one of us is feeling so happy and healthy. Sorry! Here's present #2! What's this? Look, I wanted to be admitted to the clinic with you. But I got scared of being in a cold hospital. - It's the thought that counts, so... - What's in here? - Don't peek in my backpack! - Got it! - Don't, I just bought that! No! - What's the problem? You don't look like any hospital patient I've ever seen. Allow me to check on the condition of little Bush-chan! What the heck is this? What are you doing? - I was just worried about Bush-chan. - Moron. I'm not going to dream about you anymore, Jun! - And how are we feeling? - Hello. - Did you sleep well last night? - Yes! - What did you dream about? - Dream about? Let's go to the hypnotherapy room. No! - I don't want to go! - Now, now, let's go. Hypnotherapy Room Doctor, please stop... There's nothing to be ashamed of. All healthy women have a libido. Dreams are a mirror that reflect the mind. In old psychotherapy, dreams could only be described in the patient's words. By converting them into images, we've achieved a 100% treatment success rate. This is revolutionary. Um, how long do I have to keep that ring inserted? - Another three days at least. - Three whole days? I must say, it's odd for you to take a liking to Dr. Katsuragi the first time you met him. I hate him! He's the type I hate the most! Now, now, there's no need to get so angry. It's not funny! If he shows up in my dreams again tonight, I'll blow him off! So, how does the secret ledger look? More importantly, the conference in New York is only three months away. You really can cure my husband, I take it? I know, I know. Just leave it to me. Once we announce the Dream Ring at an academic conference, I'll be thrust into the world spotlight. It's no wonder, that ring has the potential to turn psychotherapy on its head. I'll have to expand the clinic, too. We'll have more patients than we'll know what to do with. The world is a strange place... I thought that the Director's research wouldn't be worth a penny... ...is going to be our golden goose. You and Akizuki-san don't really know how the Dream Ring works, do you? No, but that invention is a work of genius. Don't! Last night's dream was rather extreme, wasn't it? But it's nothing to worry about. All women have certain nymphomaniacal tendencies. In your case, your menage a trois with the Chairwoman... ...may hold the key to solving your complex. We must pursue this avenue of study a little further. Stop it! Please, stop! Hypnotherapy's flaw lies in the profound impact... ...that replaying dreams has on a patient. This is due to the removal of the filter that speech provides. Please, stop! I'm begging you! There's no need to get so worked up. Now, sit down. Whenever I hear that bell, nothing makes any sense anymore. I lose all sense of who I am. What to do... To give you a breath of fresh air, I'll let you leave clinic grounds tomorrow. You really mean it? Confusion successfully seeded in the hypnotherapy experiments. Patient feeling jealous of Dr. Katsuragi and the Chairwoman in her dreams. Right... A bell? It starts ringing in the middle of the night. But I can't tell where it's coming from. You're not making any sense. I suddenly get all hot down there, and everything goes crazy. That hurt... Reiko-chan! Wait! Isogai Family Grave Tachibana Clinic Old Building Egg. How is he, Dr. Katsuragi? Much better than he was last week. Look at this. The moment you came in, the Director's brainwaves began to recover into a normal cycle. We must bring the Director back to his senses at all costs. Because the only one who can explain the principles behind the Dream Ring... ...at the conference in New York is this madman. Your shock therapy is our only hope. We're counting on you, Akizuki-kun. I wonder what the Director is thinking right now? Who's to say? I must say, your dedication is impressive. To think you'd go so far. This is business. You were that thirsty? Go on, Director, drink your fill. Naomi... Beloved Sister... When I learned that you suspect me of having an affair... ...with the Director, it made me so very, very sad. I am nothing more than the Director's test subject. Seeing him absorbed in his research day and night in the old building moved me. That's all. I beg you, believe me. No matter what, I will never betray you. If you were ever to betray me, I might kill you. At long last, that won't bother me. Tonight, I will avenge you, Naomi. Shape 8, shape 9, shape 19... Just a minute... Shape 1, shape 2, shape 3, shape 4. Shape 5, shape 6, shape 7. Shape 8, shape 9, shape end. They're pretty! I thought I would make sure that you had pleasant dreams tonight. Here. Your eyes are closing. Your eyelids are growing heavy. Heavy. Heavy. Just you watch, Reiko... You love Dr. Katsuragi. So you cannot tolerate him having a relationship with the Chairwoman. You will kill them. You will kill both the Chairwoman and Dr. Katsuragi. What's wrong? Why won't it ring? When I clap three times, you will wake up. You will wake up and feel wonderful. Ready? One. Two. Three! Reiko-san, snap out of it! What's the matter? Hold her down! What's wrong with her, Dr. Katsuragi? She's been hypnotized. Very deeply, at that. Hypnotized? By who? You know the answer to that better than anyone. Quit joking around. What are you up to? Look who's talking. After the conference, you're planning... ...to kill the Director and take over the clinic, aren't you? The Dream Ring is a far greater invention than anyone thinks it is. Will you join forces with me, Akizuki-kun? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, is that it? I'm right, aren't I? After all, I'm the only one who can cure the Director. This stinks... What kind of crazy clinic is this? Central Library In hypnotism, a metronome, whistle, or bell is often used... ...to induce the subject to enter a hypnotic state. A bell... Disguise Techniques I don't believe it. It's Naomi... So, you're suggesting that Akizuki-san was behind what happened last night? Yes. And quite possibly at the Director's instigation. Don't be ridiculous. My husband is completely insane. It's possible that once he's cured, he intends to work with her to kill us and-- Stop this nonsense! Chairwoman! The end result of an illicit love between a nurse... ...and a doctor whose research had hit a dead end. The media will write it up as a sad double suicide. What's this? "Replacement Diary"... What did you say? The Director's brainwaves have begun to normalize. Come to the basement at once. It all makes sense now! Reiko! Reiko? He hasn't come to his senses! I knew it, it was all a trick! Look at the readings... His brainwave cycles are gradually returning to normal... Just a little more... We have to become more like beasts. The Director is beyond that beast. It's what will restore his sanity. What sort of medicine is this? Medicine to let you become beasts. Become like beasts, too. Give the Director even more stimulation! Don't you want all those billions? Those tens of billions? Hurry! You want it all for yourself? Suffer horribly. I'm sure that Naomi suffered even more when you sacrificed her. Which sort of double suicide do you prefer? Death by fire, or hanging? Naomi? Naomi... Naomi... Why? Why are you doing this? This revenge was all for you, Naomi. You broke your promise to me. Promise? Promise me. Promise that you'll never be a man's slave. I promise, Naomi. If you break your word, I'll kill you. Reiko! Doctor? I'm scared! Doctor? Reiko, run! Reiko! - Reiko! - Jun! - What should I do?! - Run! Get away! Hurry! Reiko! Reiko! - Jun, help me! - Hang on, I'm coming! No! Stop it! Help me! Naomi... Reiko! Hey, Reiko! Come on, wake up! Hurry, climb! Hurry! Get up! We're safe now... The bell is rising up into the sky. Come on, I'm freezing! Let's go! Come on! I'm going on ahead! I feel terrific!
