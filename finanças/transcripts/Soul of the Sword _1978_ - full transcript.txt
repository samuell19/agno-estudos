I want her to witness... as to how I'll defeat you And be crowned 'King of Swords' It's not too late to pullout You are doomed to lose That's up to your sword - not your words Young man, you don't understand The sword knows no emotions You should be free of emotions and hindrances And only focus on your enemy But as she is in your heart... You're most likely to lose You can still retreat now Silence! Draw your sword The duel begins Can't you get rid of your hat? Over my dead body The outcome is determined, go Chief Instructor Lu is indeed 'King of Swords' Bury the young man with due respects Award Lu 500 taels of gold And 200 rolls of silk With a celebration feast tomorrow Old sir, what are you doing? You see... the young man who just died? I am engraving his name He's already dead Why bother? He was a good swordsman But would be soon forgotten Indeed very soon I want him remembered Is there no one who can defeat Lu? Not up to now Maybe in future I don't know if I'll live to see that day I'm sure you will I will defeat him You? You'll have to train for 10 years Maybe even before you see his face... You'll die I'll be here And engrave a name Which will be yours I'll go today and see What exactly he looks like Step down Can't you see he's just a kid? What do you want? Your hat always covers your face You must be hiding something I want to see what you look like Remember this My hat won't be removed by mere hands But by a sword Maybe when you can face me with a sword You will already be dead under my sword Stone Bridge Village In this Pai Kwa Hall... Many swordsmen have died White-faced Chiu, Siu Lu the Magnificent The Dynamic Duo, the Green Swordsman They have all died here You're but a nobody Look at your shoes You have little experience And wouldn't know who these swordsmen are Our doors are always open You have entered here today It's not too late to go back now If I wanted to re-trace my steps I wouldn't have come in the first place There are 8 of us Who do you want to have a duel with? You have no name or credentials What makes you worthy to fight with my master? My worth is my sword Monk Loong Had you drawn your sword sooner... They would not have died for nothing! Declare your name So you'll be remembered after your death A corpse contaminates the ground I will live and glorify my name Lu Tien Kang He is closing in on you No, Sire, He still has many hurdles to cross He has neither name nor credentials And looks an uncommon swordsman No He also needs to be cold and unhindered ...to have a chance to succeed But this is difficult for young people He stormed the Hall Killed Monk Loong You should be more cautious I never pay attention to a nobody But if Sire is concerned I will deal with him seriously If I were you I would sit still I have awaited you for a long time I never expected you would attack me All is fair in love and war All is fair in swordplay This is a bathing pool for men You dare to enter What guts! There are 3 kinds of people Men, women and dead people You don't look like a man to me But rather a dead person You want me to fight you barehanded? First class swordsmanship By the slightest movement Can be lethal You boast you can defeat me Don't you possess such skills? It has been rumored The Sword Lady from Lo Yeung is highly skilled To die by your sword I accept totally Tell me your history, and I will Give you the chance to draw your sword You're merely one of many swordsmen from Lo Yeung You are not worthy to know this You son of a...! Looking at you now Neither do you look like a woman But rather a dead person Who's there? You can evade 3 of my advances But I will not let you off And who might you be? I am a tenant here... who happened to come and bathe Little expecting you two would fight! They tried to ambush me Excellent swordsmanship I crossed you just now I hope you'll forgive me Think nothing of it! To venture forth in the world One has to be careful You are too kind, old sir Here's to you! May I know your name please? Chiu I at your service 'Chiu' as in popular surnames 'I' as in number one My name has been selected To mean there is nothing I can't cure So, you're a doctor? At your service Within the Sire's residence Merely holding a humble position Well, you praised my swordsmanship Meaning that apart from medical knowledge You are an expert in swordplay too You flatter me I know nothing about swordplay It's just that during my practice of medicine... I have encountered many a famous swordsmen And can talk my way through like an expert Unfortunately I haven't even touched a sword This means you know of Lu Tien Kang? Of course I do All who reside in Sire's residence I have treated at one time or other You mean, even Lu? Yes What's his ailment? He always covers his face And never allows anyone see him That's a kind of sickness That's mental sickness which cannot be completely cured Young man You seem to be very interested in Lu Would you be the Nobody Without credentials or affinity to any style Who stormed the Pai Kwa Hall And slaughtered Monk Loong's swordsmen? You have missed the Lo Yeung Sword Lady Oh, I should have known it was you In your awkward situation she had ambushed you That conduct is so unbecoming! All is fair in swordplay Lu Tien Kang said something like that once What did he say? I remember distinctly. He remarked... Cold steel knows no mercy That's what he said? Correct A swordsman must be amoral and merciless Unhindered Or he'll fail It has been rumored You wish to challenge Lu And be crowned 'King of Swords' Such a title to a swordsman... Is an honourable life-long pursuit But of course Young people ought to have such an aspiration For swordsmen like you Similar to people like us Are after many things The reality is... There is a price for everything You don't mind me saying this, do you? It's quite late Old sir, you should rest I have some matters to attend to. After you Goodbye You give me great face Allow me to finish with my drink and guest Before you confront me You nameless upstart, causing a stir Want to become King of swords Is there no due respect for the eight of us? You're wrong. There are only seven of you left As he is dead! And I don't want to wipe out you lot I'll leave you two To cheer things up a bit Be gone! Boss, boss... Don't touch him He is not dead yet Here, let me help him He is wounded Treat him with the 13-mix herbal medicine Adding rare herbal medicine Boiling all ingredients together Then take 2 more doses of Zi Jian Dan If there are problems let me know An insignificant effort unworthy of mentioning If I could save a dying man with a needle I would be happy I'd like to know When you kill a living person with a sword Does that make you equally happy? It's only when I get the title- 'King of Swords' Then will I be truly happy Sire Someone at the door... is demanding a duel with Lu What's his name? Nameless, sort of There has never been a swordsman... who could enter with such ease Dare him To storm the gates with his prowess Is that so? Prostrate yourselves Those hiding behind the door Come out! A long-enough sword But flaccid Do you think you could win by this? That's enough Stop! Come here, young man Yes The Nameless with no credentials or affinity Pays respects to Sire How can I get your name and history? When I have defeated 'King of Swords' Lu You remain nameless even in my presence? I beg Sire's forgiveness A man of principles! Rise Unfortunately Lu is out visiting friends And is not here I can wait for his return All right! On his return You two can arrange a duel And see who emerges the 'King of Swords' My great appreciation, Sire Announce to the household To entertain the Nameless Swordsman You have been following me Was it you just now? Were you behind all that? What are you doing? The Sire has ordered That you be properly entertained First thing tomorrow morning Chiu I will accompany you What has happened here? Nothing really Really? Yes, nothing When can we visit your place? I'll bet you have many children and grand-children I am quite embarrassed actually At my age Apart from a pack of needles I have no possessions Not to mention a home And I definitely have no family Oh really? I should have a family like everyone else But then I don't I'll tell you all a funny story today About a monkey climbing a pole And changing of guards There was this old businessman Very rich He took a bride Beautiful and young But as he was a business man He had to travel a few times a year On this particular day he was traveling again But he was worried about his young wife Being alone at home So he thought of an idea He painted a guard on her private region His wife was worried about him too And so She drew a monkey on his private organ And the old merchant went off on his trip But with time The sexual urge increases Such that a man needs a woman And carried away during sex All is forgotten After sex, lo and behold! What did happen? Only the monkey's bottom remained The old man then thought of an idea And drew a monkey on himself This way he could answer to his wife On the other hand That young wife of his Was tormented by sexual desire After flirting around She hit on her cousin And after sexual intercourse Oh no, what happened? The guard was gone! Now what?! She also had an idea Which was to re-draw the guard herself Soon after, the old man returned home And the two so missed each other... That they hopped into bed But the wife screamed Oh no, something is wrong The monkey should be on the underside How come it has climbed to the topside? The old man said... The monkey knows how to climb a pole And after climbing He has gone to the topside Having said that he too screamed Something's wrong The guard should be on the left Why is it now on the right? The young wife said Are you dumb? This is the guard post Naturally he patrols back and forth As such He has changed sides He is blind And cannot see Yet he is fast If it were you Wouldn't you have done the same? I am truly happy Haven't I told you before? People like you and I Rarely leave our worries And enjoy ourselves I'll bring you to a place Which will make you forget everything Really? This is Mei Yuan's Four Sisters They seldom entertain clients Don't you like any one of them? Frolicking with prostitutes requires the right mood But I have something else on my mind Additionally, for swordsmen like us To be promiscuous as you Would hurt our health That's unfounded theory We doctors rely on balancing Ying and Yang Nonsense! You are in danger of over-doing it Mr Chiu I haven't had the pleasure of knowing his name Him? He is called Nameless So he was born from a rock Come on friend, leave aside your sword Listen to music, drink and be merry It is a joy Is it? Truly Siu Chui, Siu Fan Come and entertain our guest Coming Entertain him well Come... Chiu I admires your swordsmanship As regards women Even at my age I have to see how I measure up Here, let me toast to you - No... - Drink up I can't drink, no, that's enough... Old sir, come quickly Old sir What is it? Come, come, move it What's the matter? Follow me Where are my pants? They're here You want to steal You little bastards I'll show you I mean business Little brother, please wait From this alley to the East Gate It is mostly populated by prostitutes The world has degenerated Stealing at such a young age I'll tear you to pieces Where do you want to go? The 'Hau Yuan' Shop That's a lady's shop You are a swordsman What would you want at such a place? I don't know either Come. Let's take a look Little buster, you still fight and argue Despite my age, my eyes are keen Granny, why are you scolding people again Who has got to you this time? Ouch! Thank you Thank you What sort of a world is this! Holding a lady's hand in broad day-light I'll not be a woman in my next life And be touched by you men You bunch of bastards Stealing from me again, huh? She is notorious Apart from having meals She scolds people in her sleep Don't bother with her Only a beggar and a prostitute would come here Mr Yien Why haven't you gone to Miss Ho's to buy a belt? You little punk How many belts do you wish to buy? You can't use them as toilet paper Why buy so many? Mr Yien, what would you like to buy? Miss Ho, I've come to see you Well, I'm just ordinary What's there to look at? Her name is Ho Lien The little beauty of our town He accosts her He can't even hold her hand Old sir, I wanted to ask you Can someone rise from the dead? Dead is dead There is no reason for resurrection The way you asked Does it mean you have seen the dead resurrected? I'd sure like to see that I'm afraid there is no such thing Excuse me... Sorry, sorry Dear all, my apologies Dear customers our apologies The Eight Swordsmen are meeting in our tavern They have booked the whole place Please help yourselves And forgive us Old sir You mean that... To fully enjoy drinking One must disregard everything else Come, let's drink... Thank Please... come inside and sit... Have a seat Haven't the two hunchbacks returned? Here we are with your wine This is good wine, don't waste it Come... Here comes the food Dear sirs, I am Nameless We don't mind your party I am Chiu I If anyone has any ailments I can cure them What a good doctor Let's see how you can cure us Your disease lies in your muscles and bones And can't be cured instantly If the nerve is damaged It could mean being crippled You... You dare to be insolent Bullying an old man You are hunchbacks I'll cure you in the wink of an eye You can try if you don't believe See how you 'cure' us Attack! What's going on? Have you finished? You have opened my eyes again You flatter me; just minor techniques What were you doing at the shop today? I do not have to disclose that to you You should know Ho Lien is mine Yours? You should tell her that Or put up notices around town to that extent She is yours Are you interested in her? A gentleman doesn't take from others You were gone the whole of last night Was it because of her? Could it be you really like her? She wouldn't like you She wouldn't fall for someone with a sword You measly bastard Robbing in broad day-light What's the world coming to! You little bastard! If you dare to be more furious, I'll gobble you up Little rascal... Mr Yien Miss Ho What, you've returned to buy a belt? You have bought all our belts Why are you suddenly so aloof? You pay me money, I give you the goods When had I promised more? What's with this fellow He's queer Since last night He hasn't had anything to eat or drink Or gone to the toilet Excellent skill! You may pass for an expert with a theatre troupe Still want to cross swords? Don't push me too far! Rarely does one admit being beaten This way one can learn wisely Can seize new opportunities If you still do not submit... I can give you another chance Had enough? I'll tell you, Ho Lien is not yours I have followed her one full day and night So I am taking her with me This should wake you up Mr Yien, Mr Yien I have only talked once with you And you want to take me away? Yes, I'll take you away right now When I first saw you I already gave my whole heart to you Why do you force yourself on me? Perhaps I'm used to it! Used to violence? No, used to depending on my sword You've got what you wanted You are not serious, are you? Why don't you draw your sword? A gentlemen will died for a bosom friend I am not sure if Miss Ho... knows how you feel right now Get lost! I don't want to see you again She must be very beautiful Otherwise you wouldn't be this serious Thank you, Sire I have been standing outside Waiting for Yien to draw his sword When the time comes I'll help him In fact it matters little whether you can win Your courage is commendable Unfortunately Yien lacks such prowess Announce this Henceforth no such swordsmen shall reside here Yes! Come with me I have something to talk to you I have seen many swordsmen You are number one for being daring Sire is too kind Actually daring may not always be good The fact that I can talk to Sire here Is attributed to my swordsmanship Makes sense With your swordsmanship I can make you Assistant Chief Instructor Are you interested? The annual pay is 1, 000 loads of rice But it is 2, 000 for a Chief Instructor By what you say You must fight with Lu? That's what I have waited for all my life Well said, well said I like you, so I should advise you It may be coincidental Still I must tell you Your predecessor who lived here Was a young swordsman like you Also nameless? That's not the key point The point is he also sought a duel with Lu And Lu was not here again? He was, and the two fought by night That Swordsman Eventually died by Lu's sword I don't understand Sire's intention When that swordsman came He was accompanied by a woman No one knew... if she was the swordsman's wife When the swordsman fell to Lu's feet She committed suicide I don't mind you bringing a woman in here However... Your situation is too similar to that young guy Regardless of whether I am like that swordsman I will have Ho Lien stay at the residence In that same room Though I will similarly challenge Lu I will not be killed by him But this is not determined by your words But by your sword Ho Lien is not coming back She will She was born here So was her father So was her father's father This is her home Why wouldn't she return? She is really not coming back Go back to the village I have brought her up And she is gone just like that We've met only twice You are poor, yet she likes you Even over the mountain I can smell your poverty You should treat her well She is a good girl You want to obstruct my way? And take your life too You know who I am? I am Nameless Neither do I want to know who you are Why don't you draw your sword Sharp sword, indeed Pity, it's somewhat flaccid Leaves when dead will fall You should understand this You have two choices One is to lie down Like a corpse The other one; well, you know better than I do Can you let it leave you for a moment? Since I was ambushed by the Sword Lady Every time I take a bath... I must hold on to my sword I really don't understand How many men can live like you I live by my sword Then is your sword more important than me? You are closest to me Yet I don't even know your name Someday I will let the world know At that time I should be the first to know I'll tell you one thing now One thing which I haven't told anyone Really? That woman who looked like me Really killed herself? Yes, for that young swordsman She committed suicide Is it true only the cold and merciless Are fit to be the best swordsman? Maybe so I understand The girl who killed herself always appears before your eyes That's because you've always feared Someone might enter your heart You fear the predicament Faced by that young swordsman No I wouldn't Definitely not I only need to have a sword in hand What I want I'll surely get Nobody can stop me Just as now someone wants to ambush me To take you away from me Come out, all of you! I've let you go twice This time I'll surely kill you You are not worthy to fight with me Please wait For my sake Spare him again Beat it! A cat has nine lives Are you a cat or a dog? What would a swordsman... in your spot think? Who are you? 'Lady of 3 Moves' As long as one lives One can seize opportunity sooner or later Do you want revenge? If only I could kill him I'll do anything Good Follow me Chief Instructor Would you for the sake of a girl... set free your enemy? The Chief Instructor of the palace The 'King of Swords' I, Lu Tien Kang, will certainly not I've seen him kill my men... as if he were chopping down trees Can you defeat him? He is doomed to lose Sire I heard in Sire's residence All swordsmen have been killed by you? No, two are left Yien stopped being a swordsman long ago I believe Lu still counts? Has he returned? He just arrived Why don't you stop him? Because I desire to see... who ultimately is the 'King of Swords' Old sir, You are so hasty You might be accidentally killed This is the moment I've been waiting for Why be in my way? Young fellow I have some heart-felt words Which I had not the chance to say And I almost lost the opportunity A slight discrepancy makes a great difference What one pursues is not the present moment Why? Your skills and Lu's are at the pinnacle I can't say which is better However Lu has only one opponent And has a little more obstruction than you What is that? Ho Lien When expert swordsmen fight The deciding factor hangs by a hair A slight movement or sound And by some distracting thoughts Or some hindrances Unless you get rid of these obstacles... You're beaten before you start Ho Lien is your hindrance You need to think seriously about that I am really worried about you both Ho Lien, Ho Lien Ho Lien Why have you returned alone? You went to meet Lu I feared you might not return at all I've been thinking about the girl who killed herself I didn't want to stay here alone If I had to die it should be at home Haven't I returned? You've killed Lu? No, I haven't seen him Don't challenge him to a duel anymore Stay here Treat this as your home I will do anything for you All you need to do is watch the shop for me You don't have to do anything You don't even have to tell me your name Then I can use this sword to chop firewood I know It's a palace you aspire for, not a home You want the 'King of Swords' title, not me Go, I don't want to see you anymore I am aware your sword is not for firewood Yes, I can't use it for that purpose Neither can I pretend this is my home I cannot forget that young swordsman You want to kill me? You have taken me away for no reason I willingly followed... for no apparent reason It's like a dream All seems so unreal Look Only you and me in such a big house Would you rather kill that bastard And do anything to succeed? If only I could kill him I'll do anything I'll do anything for you Really? Then, have a drink for my sake I've seen that bastard in the bath Your flesh is whiter than his You haven't seen my bedroom Come! I am a man You are too much Damn, men A big man Didn't you say You'll do anything for me? What? Do you regret it? I tell you No opponent has escaped my fourth move Only I can kill that bastard If you want him dead You have to obey me Follow me Ho Lien is your hindrance What? You have to go? Really have to go? I understand you will leave me sooner or later But will you leave just like this? I forgot to tell you one thing It's my name Of all people I want you to be the first to know Really? Tell me quickly So that's what you are called According to my nurse This is a favourite name among villagers If only I were 'King of Swords' A more common name would be uncommon You want a duel with Lu I wouldn't deter you from that I want to tell you I really like that name I'll wait for your return And I indeed believe you will You remember that night You stood in the rain The rain pouring from your boots I was peeping at you from here My heart beats faster when I think of that You can focus on getting the swordsman title Can you still remember me? Who is it? Me You are you? Nameless You've come at last Ho Lien must have died I want to ask you If you were crowned 'King of Swords' Would you be really happy? Would you regret one day What you lose is more valuable than what is gained? Like me Always prepared to kill And prepared to be killed No friends or family I just want to tell you I have come Without your hat... you might not have been struck Without discarding the hat Have I not pierced you? Chiu I? No, I am Lu Tien Kang 'King of Swords' Chief Instructor You dare not disclose your real self It's a pity you have ruined it Maybe one day in future... you will find it useful The outcome is decided You must now be very happy With sword in hand And still standing in front of me! How can the duel be ended? I've long realized The 'King of Swords' must relinquish his sword And what price he has to pay The reason I am defeated by you... is because I really like you somewhat Young man You are the 'King of Swords' from this day The Palace's Chief Instructor With an annual wage of 2, 000 loads of rice No need You said once When you are crowned the 'King of Swords' You will tell me your name Now you can Nameless You don't want to be 'King of Swords' Nor the Chief Instructor! What do you want? This world is in a mess I really don't understand What do you people want? Ho Lien, I am back I have returned to you No one has ever escaped my fourth move You are no exception Could someone as low down as you... Be the first among swordsmen? Let me tell you Ho Lien should be mine when alive I won't let her be with you even in death Ho Lien I have learnt my lesson I can never leave... leave you...
