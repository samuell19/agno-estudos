Anesthesia, cortex control to the second level. - Respiration levels are satisfactory. Heart beat regular. Blood pressure normal. Spinal reflexes I'm not sure. - Jesus Christ, it worked. - He's still alive? - Of course he is. - Do you really think she can do it? - Hell yeah, she can do anything. - Do you think she'll be pleased with us? - She's gotta be, we pulled it off. - Yeah and everything went so perfect, I can't believe it. - Not quite. You goofed back there remember. - It couldn't be helped, I didn't expect that guard. - Our orders were not to kill, you could have knocked him out. - Get off my back. - Now you listen to me, you were 30 seconds off your mark. Now the next time that happens to you-- - Here she comes. Shut up, she'll hear us. - Shh. (gong chimes) - Afternoon girls. Congratulations. (suspenseful music) There's no deterioration, you are too be commended. You also realize how important the Paulson operation is to me? And to all of you? It must be a complete success. The key to immortality, the living brain sustained, transferred into new and fine origins. And accepted because of my anti-rejection serum. Mr. Paulson's fee will ensure all our futures. $10 million. (plane engine revving) - [PAAnnouncer] Last call, Japan Airline Flight 26, last call please, last call. - [PAAnnouncer] Last call. - [PAAnnouncer] Japan Airline Flight 26, last call please. - [PAAnnouncer] Japan Airline Flight 26. (speaking in foreign language) - Mister, where to? - Downtown. - It is done, I take you. Go on, this is my taxi. Get down, get down. My name is Lapu Lapu, I am the number one, the fittest, the bravest, tip please. - Look I want is a ride okay. - You got it. Where to in downtown? - Intercontinental Hotel. - I take you the best scenic spots. Sometimes very hard to come in, it's down but it's alright. (suspenseful music) Very pretty city Manila. Many photo's, you been here before? - [Mike] No, is it always this hot here? - This is not hot. Very soon much rain. Nice pitch my friend. (laughs) Makes me a lover not a fighter. Love a little, fight a little (laughs). Good for the body. (suspenseful music) Thank you very much. - Change. - (laughs) There's no more. What's your name? - Mike. (laughing) - [PAAnnouncer] Paging Miss Janet Snow. - You there, listen I'm looking for man named Lorenzo. - Oh you must be Mr. Harber, Mr. Lorenzo is expecting you. - You bet your sweet ass he is, where can I find him? - [Lorenzo] Right here. - When the hell did you get off snatching my passport? - I have here a check for $10,000. From Lloyds of London. It's made out to you. It should buy me five minutes of your time. - Five minutes, my passport and the next flight to Melbourne. - How about five minutes over a drink, you look as though you could use one. (suspenseful music) - [Dr. Tsu] Gail, where's my schedule. - [Gail] You have the optical regeneration on Lilian Taylor scheduled for surgery tomorrow morning. And also the body bank has verified the perfect match for her eyes. - Immediately upon her arrival, program her against pain. Place her in an alpha state, 10 and a half cycles per second. You may go Gail. - Thank you doctor. - I've received a cable ofveflficaflon from our former paraplegic. The English Duke. Completion money is to the extent of 300,000 pounds sterling will be acquitted into your Swiss account, as of that date. - Good. I'm pleased to see that such a handsome man as the Duke, can be a man again. - Our South American friends are quibbling over pennies again. $500,000 to be exact. It seems as those their representative has expressed his employers concern over the nature of the donor's sex. - If it would help Gregorious, I would be happy to speak to his employer. But you can reassure him that a liver is a liver and that lungs are lungs. Besides today is a happy day and I don't want to hear of any problems. That's what I pay you for. - I know Doctor. However, business is business and we have one more matter to discuss. I think we have a problem, it concerns the Paulson donor. It seems as though Lloyds of London will be obligated to pay an insurance policy of $500,000. - For a jai alai player? - The worlds top player. His salary was extraordinary. We haven't got much time. They have to pay off the policy within 90 days. - So they have to pay off, it doesn't concern us. - If that's so Doctor, we have nothing to worry about. However our London people have informed me that Lloyds is sending a man. - Oh, some invincible force, a superman. - According to his dossier, he's a man that can be dangerous to us. - Don't you realize by now Gregorious, that no one man is dangerous to us. - His name is Mike Harber. Four years service with the CIA, five year with the Detective Bureau of the Los Angeles Police Department. - You've blown three minutes. - 48 hours ago a jai alai player, Ramone Julio was kidnapped right here in Manila. Unless he's found alive, it's going to cost my company half a million dollars. - So? - That kind of pay off is bad publicity. It could become a fad like skyjacking and get out of hand. - I'll tell you one thing, you've got a hell of a problem friend. - Now we need a miracle Mr. Harber, a miracle. - Miracle's come high. - $10,000 plus all expenses. And another $15,000 when and if you find Julio alive. - Ah, you got a piece of paper. Okay, this is what's gonna work. $25,000 win, lose or draw and if I get, whatshisname back in one piece, then I'll settle for 130 of your action. - $160,000? That's impossible. - My passport. - 10%? - That's impossible, my passport. - 20%? But I can't go a penny higher. - No one's asking you to, it's a deal. Here lay it out. (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry sir, Mr. Paulson does not allow smoking. Your attache case sir. - Are you aware of the fact young man, that I am expected. - Yes sir, it's simply routine procedure. May l? Thank you. (suspenseful music) - The case is locked. Arrangements have been made to open it only in the presence of Dr. Tsu. (suspenseful music) - With your permission sir? Use this one please sir. Ah, there's one more thing sir. An oral disinfectant. I'm sorry sir, Mr. Paulson requires it. Thank you. (cheerful fanfare music) - Mr. Paulson, it is indeed a pleasure. (coughiflg) I've been very anxious to meet you. (murmuring) - Mr. Paulson assumes all arrangements have been made? - Yes of course. Dr. Tsu will be here at any moment to discuss the details of the operation. However there is the slight matter of a fee. - Yes sir. (snaps fingers) Your deposit. One million dollars. - That takes care of the first part of the agreement. Now as for the second. - Mr. Paulson has noted that Dr. Tsu was expelled from the International Medical Association. - Dr. Tsu is a hundred years ahead of her time. And it is characteristic of human beings to resist progress. - Mr. Paulson has further noted Dr. Tsu is reported to have performed unusual experiments on her patients. - Dr. Tsu is an extraordinary woman. Her genius and her talent transcends the question of human morality. (gong chimes) - [Attendant] Mr. Paulson is concerned with the outcome of the operation. Her work is thoroughly documented. - How are you Mr. Paulson, how are you? (smooth jazz music) (coughiflg) You must set your mind at ease Mr. Paulson. You are a man who's accustomed to receiving the very best. I'm here to make sure that you get exactly what you want and nothing less. - Mr. Paulson expresses his appreciation of your remarkable achievement and regards you as an extraordinary woman. However he finds the terms of the financial agreement somewhat unsatisfactory to him. There are no guarantees and no recourse. - I often amuse myself with a provocative image that death has been seduced by a woman. The truth of the matter is quite simple. The medical facts. It is now possible for me to transplant your brain into the body of a healthy, young, virile athlete. (murmuring) - The legal issue, it is a difficult one. The outside possibility of a murder charge. - Murder? You surprise me. For a man of your position and power, the legality issue is purely academic. I'm presenting you with a probability of immortality. (coughs) (murmuring) - What remains to be done? - It's a simple matter of arithmetic. 50% of all your holdings in exchange for 100% of eternity. (smooth jazz music) - Oh he's sexy. - Wow. Sure turns me on. - [Maggie] Turns me on too. - Well what are we gonna do about it? - I'll take the bottom half, you take the top half. - He's beautiful. Perfection. - He doesn't do a thing for me honey. (smooth jazz music) Hey Vera. That one really turns me on. - The Paulson party is due to arrive late tomorrow. Now for the last item on the agenda tomorrow morning, we have the eye transplant. Has the proper donor been selected? - Yes he has Dr. Tsu, but I strongly advise a replacement. - May I ask why? - I think the body bank made a mistake. You see he has perfect eyesight now, but his medical history indicates genetic tolerance to stigmatism. - Well done, I'm proud of you Vera. Perfection is our goal, however our guarantee stipulates only the delivery of perfect eyesight. We are not responsible for the normal aging process. - Perhaps our actress will be a future customer. - Laura you make us sound so greedy. - You realize we can always find other donors Dr. Tsu. - Yes we can, but we won't. Well, shall we make our rounds girls. - I might take another look at our new arrivals. - (laughs) Yeah, new arrivals mean fresh entertainment. - Yeah, lord knows I could use a good ball. - Well god knows I'm horny enough. - Oh you gotta try the new Argentinian soccer player, he's incredible. - Yeah? - Too late. Just this morning he was requisitioned for vital organs and sent to dissection. - Fitting. (smooth jazz music) (gun clicks) - I'll bet you get your kicks out of playing with guns. - I don't play with guns. - I don't like you. - Leaver her alone Laura. - Why should l? I don't trust her, she's too emotional. You all heard what a certain doctor thinks about emotions revealing weaknesses. - And a big mouth revealing stupidity. - Well the contessa has spoken. - Stay out of this Linda, I can take care of myself. - Hey, I got a great idea. Why don't you and Vera get together and try brain sex. I heard it eliminates emotional disorders. - Maybe you'd like to eliminate me. - I'd love to. - Well what are you waiting for? - The right time, the right place. Well what have we got here? It's toy time. Let me see, I think I'll take, that one. - Hands off bitch, he's mine. - Tonight only sweetheart. - Vera come here. Mei-Ling fetch us a couple of drinks. She has a point. You're spending too much time with him. - Haven't you ever felt sorry for them? - A long time ago. It doesn't pay. Believe me it's not worth it. - Here's to a long time ago. (smooth jazz music) - Now it's my turn. (smooth jazz music) (machinery humming) - [Dr. Tsu] Freeze at 18 degrees below centigrade. - [Assistant] Yes Dr. Tsu. - Take him to the recovery room. Her condition? - Condition normal. - Good, we're ready for transplant. Prepare for the lady's surgery. - Lie still Tony, you'll be alright. - What have they done with me? I can't see. - Tony I'm sorry, I really tried. - MY eyes, my god my eyes. ' MY eyes. Darling how can I ever thank you, they're exquisite. - Well we take care in providing an absolutely perfect selection of replacement parts. - Such a perfect match. Where did you ever find? No, I, on second thought I better not ask. - Now for six months, you will take my anti-rejection serum, in pill form, to prevent the rejection of your new tissues. - Again thank you Doctor, by the way may I refer my friends to you? - You may contact me through Mr. Gregorious. - I would be more than happy to accommodate your recommendations my dear. - Oh thank you Mr. Gregorious. - Lorenzo, how do you know for sure that these athletes have been kidnapped? - Well we don't, simply on record as missing. - [Mike] How many? - 14, all over the world. And they were the cream off the top, the best athletes in the world. - Yeah well a few things bother me Lorenzo. - [Lorenzo] Yeah, what's that? - [Mike] Well number one there's been no contact attempts at all. - [Lorenzo] That's right, not even a ransom note. - [Mike] No bodies and no answers. - [Lorenzo] That's true and that leaves us with a whole lot of unanswered questions. - [Mike] Yeah, listen I'd like to have a look. You know, where you found whatshisname, the jai alai players car. - [Lorenzo] Yeah sure, I'll take you there first thing in the morning. I might as well tell you, the police came up with a big fat zero. - Ah, Lorenzo. You got some money I can borrow? - Naturally. - Don't worry I'll pay you back. (cheerful fairground music) - Okay Jack, so you busted me. What do you wanna know? - [Mike] You American? - I'm only a human being trying not get my ass shot off. They were gonna pull my number out of a hat, put a gun in my hand so I split. - Look, I need some information. The night that car was abandoned here, you see anything? - Weird trip. I'm sitting here working, you know doing my thing, when this big hearse drives up, followed by this catty limousine with two chicks in the backseat. It parked right over there. Then this other car pulled. See, these two guys get out and they carry a body over to the hearse. They put it into a casket and they just split. - You see anything else? - Who knows man? I'm blind remember. Yeah the writing on the door of the hearse said "Seaside Chapel." - Who's wired in? Got this town connected, knows everybody, everything? - That would be Won Ton Charlie. - How do I find him? - Hey man, I'm no fake. I've got my interests to protect. I've got a business here. It's called Faking Enterprises. I've got 75 dudes work on corners just like this one. - What do you know about a Chapel by the Sea or Seaside Chapel? - Never heard of it. - Well you better check into it, see if that's where the hearse came from. You ever heard of a dude named Won Ton, Won Ton Charlie? - Won Ton Charlie, you might try the City of Death. (melancholy music) - City of Death huh? - [Lapu Lapu] That's right Mr. Mike. This is the Chinese cemetery, very spooky, - You honor my dead with your presence, Mr. Harber. They will sleep well tonight. - You Won Ton Charlie? - Euphemism, slang Mr. Harber. Your presence honors the family tomb on Won Ton. Unlike in America, here in the City of Death our tombs are chambers of peace and tranquility. There are no tears in our temples. Here we welcome death Mr. Harber. May I offer you some refreshments? Some tea perhaps. - Yeah and some information. - Ah, information, that is a priceless commodity. - (laughs) Yeah, just like sex. Since you're so wired into death what can you tell me about a Chapel by the Sea. - I know no such Chapel. - Missing jai alai player, a hearse, coffin. - Is that a riddle? - No, no man, it's a Chinese puzzle. An offering to your ancestors. That's one down, two to go. - Crude but straight to the point. There's a fisherman Nono who might be of interest to you. - Where can I find him? - At the cockpits. - And what's the fisherman selling? - His last catch. - And who wants a net full of fish? - Not fish Mr. Harber, human bones. (suspenseful jazz music) (gun firing) (engine revving) (gun firing) (gun firing) (clattering) (guns firing) (flames crackling) (engine revving) (engines revving) (groans) (suspenseful jazz music) (screams) (groaning) (sighs) (metal taps) - Hey, number one. - [LaPU Lapu] Yes. - Everything alright down there. - Just checking for oil leaks Mr. Mike. Looks like someone does not like you so much huh? - Yeah it must be my warm and loving personality. Come on let's clean up. (crowd cheering) (wings fluttering) (crowd cheering) (speaking in foreign language) - He says he was fishing in the waters of Freedom Island. He has two friends, who have two fishing boats. They went near the shore, he never heard of them since. - Right and what about these human bones? Ask him. (speaking in foreign language) - He says off the coast of the Island of a Thousand Women he was able to pick up nets of human bones. Lot's of sharks in the China Sea, boss. Lots of sharks. - Can you take us there? (speaking in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (wings fluttering) (peaceful music) - Lets get out of here, ask him to meet outside okay. (suspenseful music) (machinery humming) - [Dr. Tsu] Our track star I'm told has run the mile in three and a half minutes, quite remarkable. Schedule him for a leg transplant. - Raise the brainwaves cycles from beta to alpha and restore him to consciousness. I want him sent to me tonight. - That's the second time this week Vera. You should show more restraint. Your old-fashioned way of sex runs the risk of involving the emotion and revealing weakness. - With your permission Doctor, I think I speak for all of us. Brain sex may work for you, but some of us still prefer physical contact. - There will come a time when physical contact will be unheard of. Brain sex enables you to experience the ultimate in physical sensation and eliminate emotional disorders. Increase the cortex control anesthesia to the fourth level. - Yes Dr. Tsu, on the fourth level. - [Receptionist] Attention Dr. Tsu, your call to Won Ton is now ready. - I'll take it here on the PA system. - [Won Ton] This is Won Ton. - It's come to my attention Won Ton that your organization suffers from quality control. You need to improve the status of your help. - Mr. Harber has proven to be resourceful. He eliminated six of my men. With all respect Doctor, I suggest to you that Mr. Harber represents a threat to your security. - The only threat to my security is an associates inability to perform. The fact of Mr. Harber's existence no longer concerns you. I shall determine Mr. Harber's fate. Good day Won Ton. - As you say Doctor. - We are ready to surgically here with the splinter. (smooth jazz music) - Three loso, no ice. - Yes sir. - What did you find out? - Just that there are no funeral homes in Manila called Chapel by the Sea. - They all keep quiet when they talk about the islands. - But we did get an interesting report from the United States. It seems a witness claims that a hearse was used in the abduction of a basketball player. - Well then that ties into the blind beggar. - Now we checked the manifests of the flights on that date and there was a coffin shipped to Manila. It was accompanied by two women dressed in mourning and met by two more women. - That's a lot of widows. (smooth jazz music) Now gentleman it's been a long day. Have some milk. Try that. You know you, you got great legs baby. - Thank you. - But they're too long. - Oh. - I don't like long legs, they get in the way. - Well let's see what we can do about keeping them out of the way. (murmuring) Well we'll see what we can do about that. (murmuring) (smooth jazz music) You're really beautiful. It isn't often I meet a man like you. You're one I'll remember for the rest of my life. And I promise you, I will. - You know that's what I like about you baby. You're unpredictable. - I am predictable about one thing. I never miss. (gun firing) (suspenseful jazz music) (groaning) (wood cracking) (glass smashes) (clattering) (gun fires) (suspenseful jazz music) - Hey boss, Mr. Mike! She went that way. - [Mike] Well come on. - I will come. - Yeah okay, well you follow me! (suspenseful jazz music) (groaning) (horns blaring) (groaning) (horns blaring) (suspenseful jazz music) (engine revving) - [Lapu Lapu] Mr. Mike, Mr. Mike! - Over here. (horns blaring) (suspenseful jazz music) (horns blaring) (brakes squeal) (brakes squeal) (horns blaring) (horns blaring) (brakes squeal) (glass smashes) (suspenseful jazz music) (clattering) (horns blaring) (horns blaring) (wood smashing) (brakes squeal) (clattering) (brakes squeal) (suspenseful jazz music) (horns blaring) (brakes squealing) (metal crashing) (metal crashing) (brakes squealing) (engines revving) (horns blaring) (wood smashing) (water splashing) (smooth jazz music) - You bastard! - Now you've been in there over an hour. You ready to talk yet? Come on sweetheart, let's get out there. Now look at that. I've been trying to teach you to behave like a lady, but you don't seem to appreciate that. So now talk. (gun clicking) Who are you? Why did you try to kill me? And where did you come from? I said talk. (suspenseful music) - The patients under cortex control Doctor. - [Dr. Tsu] Excellent. - [Receptionist] Attention, attention. Paulson party has arrived. Operation Paulson is now in session. Please use all security precautions. - Give orders to reception. Take Mr. Paulson to the alpha room. Maintain at 62 degrees for 12 hours. Place him in the beta state at six cycles per second. - [Assistant] Yes Dr. Tsu. (suspenseful music) - Boss, boss, that vine. - Now be quiet. Here let me take it in. Now you listen to me, come on. Alright back to some basics, which way? - You'll never get off the island alive. - Yes that's possible, come on let's go. You coming? - Don't worry boss, I stay right here and I watch my uncles bunker. - Your uncles what? - My uncles boat. Don't worry boss, I'll be right here when you come back and I'll take you home safely. - Alright. (suspenseful music) Oh no, not again. Did you see where she went? - Boss, do not take your eyes off her, she's very tricky. - No shit. (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry. I tried. But he's so damned, unpredictable. - Sit down Linda. It might be amusing to have you two exchange parts. You my dear, with your lovely face and figure. He with his brain and sex. - Dr. Tsu let me have another chance, I know him. I know how he thinks. I'll find him for you and I'll bring him back. - Let her have another go at it. After all what have we got to lose? - Don't fail this time. - I won't. You can count on it. - Laura keep a watch on Linda. - You can count on it. (suspenseful jazz music) (guns firing) (suspenseful jazz music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (suspenseful jazz music) (suspenseful music) (groans) - Ladies. - [Gregorious] Ah, Mayan volcano soup is the finest I've ever tasted. - My chefs survival depends on her ability to satisfy my tastes. (suspenseful music) Well if it isn't the indestructible Mr. Harber. - Oh don't let me interrupt your snack. - We've been looking forward to this meeting with great anticipation. Please join us. - No thanks, I forgot my Bank of America card, I'll take a rain check on it. - Sit down Mr. Harber. (sighs) I think you're going to be a most interesting diversion. - You know I got a good idea, but I'm gonna ask you anyway. What type of business you in? - Transplants Mr. Harber, transplants. It is possible for me to transplant any part of the human body. - Any part? - Any part. - Listen, what's old fish nose got to do with transplants? - Mr. Gregorious seeks our clients and arranges the financial agreement. My organization secures a donor. - See that explains the kidnapping of the jai alai player, whatshisname, and the other missing athletes. - Correct Mr. Harber, the law of supply and demand. Strong young bodies are at a premium. - And how high are these premiums? - As high as the market will bear Mr. Harber. - Now take you for instance. You're not exactly what I would consider blue ribbon material, first class merchandise. But with Mr. Gregorious's superb negotiating abilities you could maybe command $400 to $500,000 for your body. - With all due respect Doctor, I think you're a bit high. I mean I would have to sell him completely on his, virility. Now if he were a few years younger. - You're quite right Gregorious. But enough of these social amenities. I'm sure Mr. Harber is anxious to look over his new home. - Sure, why not? (suspenseful jazz music) Isn't that Peter-- - The Paulson case, will be my most important achievement. A complete brain and body transplant. It may surprise you to learn Mr. Harber, he died eight hours ago. - But he's still breathing. - I have placed him under an alpha controlled consciousness. So his brain will not deteriorate from lack of oxygen. - Alright. Hey isn't that uh-- - [Dr. Tsu] The jai alai player, yourjai alai player. - Is he dead? - On the contrary, he's in perfect physical condition, but in a comatose state. Now Mr. Harber, ultimately you will end up here. That's my voloscope. - A What? - [Dr. Tsu] My vital organs vault. - Oh. You mean to tell me these things still work? - They will when transplanted properly. All of these organs are functional. With the discovery of my anti-rejection serum it was possible for me to develop a preserving solution. - That's incredible. - Credibility is the matter of exposure and conditioning. A few years ago, an interplanetary flight was considered incredible, but now it's a simple matter of fact. Such as this. All usable. Thawed in a matter of moments by high frequency sound waves. - I gotta hand it to you Doc, this is a hell of layout you got here. You don't waste a damn thing do you? - Nothing, not even my failures. (groaning) I call him Tyrannosaurus Rex, after the dinosaur, to remind me that evolution also made mistakes. (groaning) I would get too close if I were you. That's Goliath. (groaning) Now let me introduce to my pet Shangri La. She was my first brain transplant, I had to use the brain of an ape. - I'd hate to come to you with a headache Doc. - [Dr. Tsu] He's Colossus. - Didn't he used to play basketball? - Hmm-mm. He gets terrible upset when he's ignored. I think he's jealous. It may seem fantastic to you Mr. Harber, but remember we live in an age where fact and fiction are two sides of the same coin. These are creatures which I created. Granted they are mistakes. - Yeah, yeah I'll go along with that. - Come, I have a delightful surprise for you. (smooth jazz music) You and I will undertake a different kind of experiment. One I'm sure you will enjoy. - Lead on Doc, you haven't disappointed me yet. (machine humming) - Brain sex. There are thousands of erotic areas not fully experienced by the ordinary mind. (suspenseful music) (moaning) (laughing) (machine rattling) - The heart is stopping, reaction negative. Emergency, emergency. The brain is close to the deterioration point. Notify Dr. Tsu. - [Receptionist] Emergency, emergency, Dr. Tsu, emergency. Paulson's heart has stopped. Dr. Tsu emergency, Paulson's heart has stopped. - Prepare him for surgery immediately. I will rejoin you later. (moaning) Have Vera join me in the operating room immediately. Arrest her, place her in detention and schedule her for a complete dissection. Take her away. - [Laura] Move. - Guard, take Mr. Harber to my office. (suspenseful jazz music) (groans) (gong chimes) - Linda, don't shoot I want out too. Together we can make it. - Good, let's get Mike out. - Just a minute, we need to create a diversion or it won't work. - You're right. What do we do? Dr. Tsu's freaks. - Good. - You take this, go down and let 'em out. I'll get Mike. - We'll meet at the boat dock. - Right. (smooth jazz music) (gun fires) (alarm blaring) - [Receptionist] Alert, alert, escape in progress. The cage room specimens are loose. Alert, alert, escape in progress. The cage room specimens are loose. - I can't stop now. Bolt the doors. (alarm blaring) - [Receptionist] Attention, cage room specimens are to be destroyed on sight. Attention, cage room specimens are to be destroyed. (alarm blaring) Alert, alert, escape in progress. The cage room specimens are loose. (smooth jazz music) (alarm blaring) - You know if it really came down to it, I think you could take me. - You've got a big mouth. Help me loosen up these ropes, we've gotta get out of here. Pretty soon all hells gonna break loose. - Not yet, I a hundred grand laying around here someplace and he's still alive. - Who is it? - The jai alai player. Grab the machine gun. - You know that emergency operation? He's the one. - [Mike] Lead the way. (alarm blaring) (smooth jazz music) - [Receptionist] Attention, red alert, red alert. Armed prisoners are escaping. Attention, red alert, red alert. Armed prisoners are escaping. - He's dead. Leave me. (suspenseful jazz music) (gun fires) (gun firing) (glass smashing) (gun firing) (glass smashing) (alarm blaring) (suspenseful jazz music) (gun fires) (guns firing) (alarm blaring) (suspenseful jazz music) (guns firing) (gun fires) (suspenseful jazz music) (gun fires) (gun fires) - He's unharmed Mr. Harber. That will do you no good. The glass is armored, it's bulletproof. - Listen lady, aren't you a little tired of playing God? - You won this time, but just remember, like all great minds we cannot avoid our destiny. Goodbye Mr. Harber. (explosion booms) - Come on kid, let's go home. (peaceful oriental music) (smooth jazz music) - [Lorenzo] My god, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
