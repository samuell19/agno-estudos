Bye, Sandra. Take care. Bye, baby. He said "Bye, uncle." -Please, write... -You, too. We've got everything. Everything? Bye. Take care. You know you can join us anytime. Let me think about it. I'll see how things go here. -Any message for the old man? -No... just tell him I'm older. Bye. Bye. GOOD LIFE Hi. Five pesos... -Hi. Let me help you. -It's okay. Thanks. -How are you doing? -Fine. And you? -I'm okay. -Well... let's see. -CNG cars are great, huh? -Yes. -The air pump? -Over there. -Yeah, but it wasn't working yesterday. -No? -No. Let me see. -Lots of work? -Yeah, more or less. Many hours, huh? Yes. It's no so much the hours as the fact that we never stop. -Sure. Not even for lunch. -Yes, but half an hour... -There it is. Done. -Thank you. -See you around. -Wait. What? We could have lunch together tomorrow. I eat near here. -We could eat together. -Yes, but no. -I only have half an hour. -Come on. -Here they must interrupt you all the time. -That's true... We could go to a small BBQ place. They have sandwiches with sausages, ...or blood sausages if you prefer. Or grilled red meat sandwiches. Or just grilled bread. Different kinds of pasta... -So? Did you like it? -It's very good. -Anything else? -No. -Sure? -Sure, but you go ahead. Do you want me to eat more? I can't eat anything else. I'm heavy enough. Well... Shall I pick you up with the scooter and take you home? -No. -Well, you could be nicer... -No... you better not. -Because of your boyfriend? -"Ex" boyfriend. -Well... that's better. I'm still staying there... until I get a place. Yes, but you've been looking for a while... -It's not easy. -That's why I'm here... No. I'm serious. I didn't dare... ...to tell you before but I have an extra room. My brother lived there with his wife. But they... ...moved to Spain so it's empty. It's in my house. And... You can come to check it... ...and stay for a few days. You can rent it. I'm looking for something for me alone. But thanks. It's good. I can't get a "yes" today... Well... Do you want me to leave? -No. -Shall we go? CAR SERVICE MESSENGER SERVICE My face is freezing. -No "mate"? Everything okay? -Yes. Six. "Good Life" delivery service. Ye, Mrs. Lopez, Roberto speaking. What can I do for you? Of course... Just anyone? I don't know. That depends on traffic. Yes, as soon as possible. Don't worry. Bye. Kid, come here. Get this and take it to Mrs. L?pez. -Go. -I'm going. Before 12 o'clock. Leave those snails... I'm sick of them. You know what? Take them to the back. Give him a hand. There's no light there. Give them a flashlight! What do I care?! So, shall I do this or the snails? I'll get this. -Hey, kid, where's Beto? -I have no idea. What do you mean? He said he'd be here at noon. I can't believe this guy! Is this a joke? What is this? TURN FOR SALE Asshole, asshole. Honey... Asshole... Asshole... -I copy you. -Asshole... are you there? Yes, what do you want? Roberto is bitching. Are you coming? I've been here at the consulate since last night. Tell him I'll go when my mom gets here. Understood, my queen. See you. Bye, asshole. -Change the "mate" leaves. -Are you the boss now? Do it, Snail. The Snail will do it. Wow! -Hello. -Hello. -How are you? -Fine. Were you serious about the room? -Yes. -Great. I have to see a place at 6 PM... ...but I'd like to see yours first. Okay. Can we go? Come in. This is the "suite" "suite dreams". I'll move these so you can put your things. -It's good. -It's good. And this? That's me with my brother. The one who left for Spain. -And these are your parents? -No. Well, my father with his wife. My mom died years ago. What a bummer. Listen... Well... This is the place. If you move in we would have to talk about... ...the other spaces... about having some rules... ...about the kitchen, bathroom, dinning room. If one of us goes to sleep late... wash your plate after you eat... It's fine with me. How much? One hundred a month. 100... -And services? -Well... let's say... If we are careful it could be another hundred... Fifty each, roughly. That's okay. Can I move in today? Yes. Fine, then I'll pay you now. I have $100 on me. Good. Let me give you a receipt. -It's not necessary. -No, let me do it. Okay. -Can you fix it? -Yes. I have Patacones and Lecop bonds instead of pesos. -Lecop... you kill me. -But it's all I have. Okay, it's fine. -It's okay. -Are you sure? -Yes. -It's Patricia, right? -Yes. But put that I'm the tenant. You are the landlord and I'm the tenant. -Hello. -Hello. -Was the water fine? -Yes, great. Thank you. What's this? -Is it yours? -Yes. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Do you study architecture? -No. Industrial design. I'm not going to school now, that's for a job I'm doing. I'm kind of stuck but it'll get there any time. I hope so. -Do you smoke? -No. I might have a lighter though. Shall I get it? No, no. It's okay. -I'll go to sleep. -Fine. -It's late. -Yes, it's late. -Good night. -Bye. -Hello. -Hello. I was waiting for you. -You were waiting for me? -Yes, I was concerned. Everything okay? -Sort of. -Sort of? Come here. Let me put this here... It's for your back. Thank you. So... your day was just okay? Yes. -What happened? -I had a terrible day. Somebody gave me counterfeit money, a bill. -What a bummer! -Yes. About the bill... I can talk to Seba, my co-worker. -And? -Well... I'll give it to him and tell him it's mine. I always give them to him so forget about it. -Do you think so? -Yes, forget it. Okay. Lucky that you were waiting for me. -Lucky? -Yes, thank you. You're welcome. -I'm here for you. -In what sense? For whatever you need. If you come to my house I'll always be here. Yes, because it's your house. Good observation. But I mean more than the physical presence. I mean in spirit beyond our professional relationship. I could be your support. -My technical support. -Yes. Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense. We are here together... ...so we should count on each other. Right? -Fine. -It's fine by me too. When you got a problem you just tap on my shoulder. And vice versa. Yes, what do you need? -My boss is very mean. -Well... Tomorrow I'll beat him up and set the gas station on fire. I'll blow up everything. Bye. Good! Yes. What...? You were here yesterday. What do you need? -Your time expired. Bye. -My time? This is quite uncomfortable. Can we share? Like this... As if it were yours. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. Another "mate" and then I'll go. -You're running late, right? -Yeah, I'm late. It's so cold! Yes. I have everything. Done. Well... I'm going. Well, I'm going. A kiss from a confused friend. Well... Bye. Bye. I've already told him. I can't shoot him if he doesn't want to pay me. You call him later. I'm nearby. I'm on my way. Okay. Hi! It's freezing! Hi! -Stop! It's all clean. -I was just going to kiss you. You're all muddy. -Are you in a bad mood? -No, I'm cleaning. What are you laughing at? My classes? I'm just laughing. I'd rather laugh than cry. In New York there are excellent designers. -And here? -Here we invented the ballpoint. -And buses. -Yes, and buses. And "dulce de leche". And kisses too. Hey, you have too many clothes on! -It's very hot. -Yes, very hot. -Too many buttons? -About 50. Come here, I'll help you. -That's so nice. -Let me help you too. Like this, like in a roller coaster. There, like in a roller coaster. You too. It's cool. Can I have a kiss? Give me a kiss. -Let's go to sleep. -I'm not tired. -No, let's go to sleep! -Let's sleep... Hi, hi! Pato! Telephone! Try not to give this number. This is not pay phone. Hello... Hi, mom. What? No... But I've told you I can't. What? No, mom, it's always the same. What do you want me to do? No, stay there. I'll see what I do. Hello... Pato. Hi. Hi. Are you Hern?n? Yes. I'm Elvira. Pato's mom. We've just arrived from Mar del Plata. -Have you talked to her? -No, no, no. Sorry but... we were very tired after the trip... ...so we laid down. It's okay. Thanks. Let's see... -Is it fine, darling? -Yes. -Hern?n? -No, thanks. I want to thank you in the name of my family... ...for this beautiful gesture of yours. For letting us stay and for sharing your table with us. That's no longer a common gesture among Argentines. Thank you very much, Hern?n. It's okay. It's not a big deal. -Luli, thank Hern?n. -Thank you, sir. You're welcome. -Hello. -Hi. Hi! Sorry, Hern?n, I called Good Life... ...but you had already left. -We've introduced each other. -You did? Yes, everything is fine. -Can they stay here tonight? -Yes, no problem. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -It's busy. -It's me. -Can I come in? -Yes. -Well, I'm already in. I... I wanted to apologize for my parents. -I would've loved to tell you before. -It's okay. -They're like that. -They are your parents. If they're visiting they won't stay at a hotel. I know... but thank you anyway. That's all I wanted to say. You're welcome. -A fresh face... -How do you like Luli? She's beautiful. How old was your mom when she had her? -My mom? -Yes. She wasn't any age. Luli isn't her daughter, she's mine. -You're kidding me. -No, I'm serious. How could I joke about that? And why didn't you tell me? You never asked. If you'd asked I would've told you... We have a relationship. I thought we could share something like that. And I would've told you but you didn't ask. What's wrong? You don't love me anymore because I have a daughter? Yes, I love you. It's not that. It's only that I wish you'd told me. That's all. I would have. Sorry. -Do you forgive me? -I forgive you. You sort of forgive me. Forgive me all the way. -I forgive you. -No, all the way... Okay. Leave it there! Hello. Good morning. Good morning. Did you have breakfast? -I didn't dare to. -But it's okay... really. -Do you want tea? Coffee? -I prefer some "mate". -"Mate"? -Yes. -Okay. Let me prepare it. He quit smoking 10 years ago and he's still getting it out. What a face! Do you want some? Do you like it? -And you? -Yes, it's very good, strawberry jam. Try it. Good, isn?t it? These sell so well. People come... ...from France, Italy, Switzerland to get them. Petigree,... ...the ones I have, go for $16 the kilo. I have 4.5 kilos in this box. And in 2 months I'll have 7. Seba, what's this doing here? -They're mine. -Yes, I know. I gave them to you yesterday. -I'll do it later. It's a favor. -A favor?! Kid, this is a job! -I do deliveries, I don't hand out fliers...-Then deliver these fliers! Those fucking snails mess up everything! I told you to get them out of here. Clean, sweep!! You too, kid. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -We're still here. -Yes. I'm looking for my cousin but I can't find him. I can't find him... We will leave tomorrow... ...or the day after at the most. Look, I'll pay you. Not the first night because you invited us but I'll pay you. Don't worry if you need an extra day. You don't need to pay me. Yes, I do. Money is necessary because when you don't have it... ...you don't know where you can end up. You see? It's very nice to find a young man like yourself. Somebody with a big heart who says: "If you want to stay for a day, a week... you can." But I don't because I don't take advantage of people. And if I have to move under a bridge I do... ...because it's my own fault. No, I'll prepare it. The least I can do is to prepare you a good breakfast. -Hello. -Hi, Luli. Here's the sugar. Do you always go with the scooter? Yes, always with the scooter. People are lazy... but you can't complaint, you have a job. And that's a blessing. Yes, sir! A blessing! A job is a blessing! If you want to move ahead you have to work. We'll bring this country forward with everybody's effort. That is, if we want it to get out of the pit it's in. -I'm going. -No, come here. No, your parents are there. No, come on, come. Quickly... Bye. I wanted to have breakfast with you but I overslept. -Are you going? -Yes. Your parents are there. Bye. -Shall we eat together? -Yes -Will you come for me in the scooter? -Yes. Bye, bye, bye. Well, I'm going to work. It was a pleasure to meet you. -Bye. -Hold it man, wait. Give him one to try. Stop running so much! -Bye, Luli. -Here. -Try one. -Fine. -Come on! -And? -Good, good... -Have another one. -No, no. -How are you doing, Pato? -Fine. -What do you do on Saturday? -I work. I mean in the evening. Nothing. I don't know. -Do you like going to the movies? -Yes. Do you want to go? I don't know. Call me if you want. -I don't have your number. -I don't have a telephone. -Can I call you here? -No, I can't receive calls here. -Then? -Then what? I mean, how do we... We'll see. Do you like it? -Very good. -Fine, see you. -Bye. -Bye. -What are you doing? -I knocked but nobody answered. -You were peeking. -No, I wasn't. We need to talk. The house is full of boxes. You were peeking. I was changing and I was going to answer. I want you to take the boxes, the machinery, everything out. Venancio will be back in five minutes. He'll explain everything. Meanwhile I'll finish changing. Hello. -Hi. How are you? -Fine. -Can I talk to you a sec? -What a face? What happened? I got to my house and your parents filled it up with machines. Oh, no... I don't know. It's full of boxes, flour, machines. Oh, Hern?n. Hey, come here. You don't know how much I argued to stop him. But Venancio is like that. I don't know what to do. I don't get it. You knew? No, I didn't. This morning he tried to borrow $1,500 from me... ...to buy a guarantee for a rent. I told him I didn't have that money. But you know Venancio. Hold it. Originally they were going to stay for a night. -That was fine. -Yes, I know. I do not want those machines in my house. I know, Hern?n. But, listen, I only have $1 70. If I ask for an advance I can raise $480. That's all. They don't have anywhere to go. So? Do I run a charity? I don't have that money either. Are you asking me for money? Don't make a face. Either I have $1,500 or else...? That's great, huh? Seba, can you leave us alone? I have to talk to Beto. Sure. Look, Beto, I made a decision. Hello. -Hi. -How are you? I've been talking to Patricia and she told me that... I apologize. We're leaving. But before leaving, let me give you an opportunity. -What? -An opportunity? We are seriously thinking about expanding the company. And we're looking for a partner to invest. You see? And we wanted to give you the opportunity. I'm not interested. Thanks. But you must be interested in making money. You're an intelligent kid. These machines are worth between 2 and 3 thousand pesos. And that's without including our portfolio and our prestige. And before expanding our business to supermarkets. You have to be interested! The train of opportunities only goes by once. -Hi, Pato, what's up? -Hi. -You're leaving? -Yes. Are you going home? Do you want a ride? I'll give you a ride. No problem. Hop on. Okay. Hello. Hern?n, I'm sorry. And that was how long ago? About 10 days. Ten days! You've been invaded, kid. You must do something. Why don't you see the attorney upstairs? You have nothing to lose. Go now that we have no work. -See you. -Bye. -Seventy-two! -That's me! Go in. Do you know the way? -No. -At the end of the corridor. Yes, come in. -Hello. I'm Dr. Linares. -Hern?n. Nice to see you, Hern?n. Hern?n... Hern?n... Your last name was? -Quintana. -Quintana. You must be patient, Quintana. We'll get it, we'll get it. -Get what? -The injunction! But I haven't come for that. I goy another problem. Another problem? I don't know how... The thing is I rented somebody a spare room. And that person brought her entire family and took over the house. Now they say they'll leave if I give them $1,500 but... -$1,500 -Yes. Extortion! A clear case of extortion. $1,500 Negotiate it yourself, Quintana... It was Quintana, right? I charge but if you go and talk to them... Give them $1,100. Okay? I don't have a cent. I won't pay them to leave my house. Let's do something, then. Is the house yours? -Yes. -You own it. My father does. -Do you have a job? -Yes. -How much do you make? -$380 a month. -Do you have a car? -A scooter. You have... problems. You're practically in poverty. $380, that's nothing. We'll start an eviction procedure. Okay, Quintana? -Yes. -That will take 2 years. Be patient, there's no problem. I'm interested in the case. I can't give you all the time you need right now but call me. Call me to the number downstairs, the other doesn't work. Okay? Call me. If he had to fire somebody it would be me... I don't know. You're paranoid. He knew I was leaving. He knows I won't sue him. Asshole. What really bothers me is that he fired me like that. No warning... Do you understand? Did you get the passport? No, it'll take those fucking Italians 6 months to issue it. Six months? I don't know what I'll do in the meantime... Fuck it! If you don't want to because you're tired is fine. -You're not mad? -No, Pato, please! You know what? How about going to a place in the country for the weekend? Some friends invited me. It's a terrific place. -Get some sun... fresh air. -Sounds nice. What do you think? I don't know. I promised Luli we'd be together and... We'll go with Luli. I think she'll like it and I'd love to meet her. What do you say? We'll see. How's Luli? What? I mean what's Luli like? Luli is beautiful. Hello. What took you so long? Dad, I'm a grown-up person. I can't tell by the way you act. -Take one, sir. -No, thank you. Take one. I can't explain it now because I'm with the girl but call me. I'm organizing a meeting with real people, driven people... ...to make money in our free time. You do have time in between shifts... don't you? You'll see how life stops being dark for you. Here. People are hungry and there's no work. Then I said to myself: "Venancio, you must start a business creating work posts." And I want you to join in our company. You look dynamic, you have the drive, you look like... ...you have the inclination we Argentine have towards work... Hello. There. Elvira, what are those people doing in the living-room? Who are they? I'll explain. I'll be right back. -Did you leave your number? -Yes, sir. Perfect. -We'll be calling you. -Venancio, what's this? -I'll explain. -You'll explain my ass! Be alert because this won't happen again. We will only call you twice. Folks, the post is taken and I... ...don't want to waste your time. -Thank you. -Bye. Are you happy? Thank you. -I'll wait for you to call. -Fine, fine. Don't worry. What's this, Venancio? What are these papers, these work forms, all this shit? You'll set up a shop in my house? Give me 2 weeks, I'll get some money and we'll leave. Don't treat me as if I were stupid, Venancio. If you don't leave I've spoken to an attorney. A lawyer? You're irreverent. Who do you think we are? Besides, do you know how long an eviction takes? Between 12 and 18 months. So, relax. Here we are... ...either all saved or we all perish. Is it clear? The thing is that I think that sometimes I look stupid. What d'you mean? Yeah, because of the things that happen to me... Either I look stupid or I have a stupid look in my face... -There, that face... -I didn't make any face. That's the face of a stupid guy... There... no, there!... That's it! But I'm not making any face. That face you're making. You look stupid. And you don't! You look so smart! You look like a stoned snail with big rubber lips. You think you're so cool. Ah, what the fuck! -Careful, man. -Who is it? Who are you? I'm Ramon Ticona, the baker. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you my ass! Get lost! Take all this shit away! -Don't touch it. It's leveled. -Don't touch it?! Don't take it like that. Your partner told me you've quarreled. But relax,... ...I?ll work hard for "La Normanda". -I don't give a shit! -Don't touch it! What are you doing?! Mom, what's going on? Don't worry, love. It's okay. -What? What's up? -Please let me in. -No, this is it. -Please, Hern?n. I have to use the bathroom. I have to go. There's a gas station 2 blocks away. I won't walk two blocks... I'm in a hurry. -Get out! -Let me in! Don't touch me! -Get lost! -What the fuck...! -Don't yell at me! -Out! Dad! What happened? Are you okay? You're bleeding. Hern?n! Hern?n! Please open up. Go get a glass of water. Hern?n! Are you there? Open the door. He's hurt. Bring alcohol, cotton, peroxide. Hurry up. Easy. Hold on to me. -Give me that. -Don't touch it. Don't touch it! -Here. -Look. -Yes. -Don't touch it! -Don't move! -You'll need stitches. -No, no! -Yes, yes. You lift this... easy. Then you put it here. -You can help yourself with this. -Elvira, Elvira! -What's the matter? -It's 4 AM. -Don't you see we're working? -I'm sleeping. -Do you want me to fix you breakfast? You're already up. -Do you understand? -Yes. Hern?n... Excuse me. Look, I wanted to talk to you. I feel guilty, man. Seriously. I know about the situation with Venancio... ...but you have to understand that I need the job. We've known each other for how long? If a thief gets in here I'll be the first to come and help you. But this is different. This is a family thing. -Do you understand me? -Family my ass, fucker! This is an excellent business. Excellent for everybody. None of you will need to invest one single cent. Unlike in other businesses... ...that demand us to put down money,... ...a money we would invest... ...but a money that we do not have... -Here all you need is... -Excuse me. ...love, care, passion... ...for an Argentine product, for a 100% Argentine company. -We stand up against... -Hey, you! Get off, man. You'll break it. We are driven to manufacture something. Because "churros" are... what? They are Argentine!!! -Sorry, I didn't hear you. "Churros" are... -Argentine! That's right. Of course, folks, they are from Argentina. Let's see who wants to share this experience,... ...the beautiful experience of a network called "La Normanda". Come over here, Beto, please get here... ...share your experience with us, give your testimony. You?re a winner. Venancio gave me the opportunity and I'm trying... ...I?m trying to get top distributors. It's not that easy to get top distributors. -Very well, buy... -I'll talk them into it. -Meaning...? -People need an explanation. We have to explain it... And it must be done with love... You go and explain them. Otherwise it seems impossible but it's great. How much do you make? With the retail sales, the royalties from my distributors... I would say about $200 a month. $200! $200! Only in his spare time. Give Beto a hand! Come on! Come on!! -D'you want to get off? -I don't know. I don't feel very well... Are you in pain? No, I'm not. I just don't feel well. Do you want me to take you to eat something? -No, I don't want to bother you. -Bother? Please, Pato, let me take you out for dinner. -This is done, right? -Yes, it is. Take it out. Put some more. You got mail, Hern?n. It's opened. Who opened it? I don't know. I found it like that. So, this is the way things are now? Fine, then tell me how's my brother, how are things in Spain... -I don't know. I didn't read it. -Then call your dad and ask him. What's it? What's the limit? I don't know. I don't know, Hern?n. I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you. It's awful what's going on. I don't know what to say. But I do love you. Fine, I'll go read the letter. "Churros", warm pastries!!! "Churros"! "Churros", warm pastries! What are you doing here, kid? -What do you do? -Get lost! -What? Why? -Because this is my area. -The walkway is mine. Go! -Did you buy it or what? -Stop! -You'll go because if not I'll take your basket. Get lost, kid! Out, fucking kid! Motherfucker! "Churros"! Nothing... They say it's not what they expected. -But they'll stay anyway. Give me. -I'll carry it. No, I'll do it. I'd like you to understand... ...that I have nothing to do... ...with what's going on... I know you're not happy but I'm sick and tired too. What's going on hurts me too. Like that line that goes... "The hurricanes of love..." "...are the storms of..." -Well... it doesn't matter. -No, tell me. I don't remember... Wait... "The hurricanes of love are the storms of..." I don't know. The bus is coming. Look who's outside but don't be too obvious. Did you see him? -You know him. -He looks familiar. It's Colifa, I told you about him. He plays soccer with the Morales. -He's good. -He plays fucking well. He used to play with... What's his name? I don't know. He's a bully and does it. Does what? He gets people out of houses. Why don't we tell him? He goes to your place and takes everything out. I don't think he'll ask for much. The guy is cheap. -Come on, talk to him. -I'm going, wait. Seriously, when you're not home he takes all the shit out. -Don't bullshit me. -Okay, I'm bullshitting. This is really big, Pato. We are through with living this way. I know this business very well and I know how to manage it. But I worry about your mom,... ...it's too much for her. The fucking arthritis bothers her. -You're not going to wipe it first? -Yes, sorry. You have to pay attention. Being sorry is not enough. I was saying that your mother... It's full of bread crumbs! Sorry, I didn't see them. I was saying that your mother... Her wrists ache, her bones. She's going to need a hand. You'll have to quit your job at the gas station. Don't ask me to do that, dad! Don't argue! Do as I say! But it's a regular job, dad. Don't ask me to quit, please. Go... take it all with you. Go. -Mom, can we go to the playground? -No, I have too much work. -Come on, mom. Please! -I'm "mom", she's grandma. -Don't tell her like that. -She has to understand it. You confuse her all the time. Come here, Luli. I'm your mom, love. You were in my belly for nine months, did you know that? Who is it? Hello. What's up? I wanted to talk to you. May I? Come in. I was about to go to sleep. Can you wait until tomorrow? Luli... Can you hear me? I have to go now but I'll be back. And we'll be together until you're as big as I am. Okay? Give me a kiss... ...and a hug. Lay down. There you go. Hello? -Hello, Jose Luis? -Yes, Pato, what are you doing? I wanted to ask you a favor. Can I come in? Sure, come up. Thanks. I'll make the bed. Don't worry. Okay, here you have sheets, a blanket... Thank you very much. -Anything you need you just wake me up. -Thank you. Are you okay? Yes. Good night. -Bye. -Bye. See you tomorrow. Thanks. Good morning! Hello. Hi. How are you doing, Seba? I was telling them that... well you know... this is it. I thought that perhaps you... I don't know... That maybe you could be interested in continuing this... I don't know. What are you saying? You owe about 5 months of rent. Yes... And to stock it and everything we'd need about 3 thousand. Sorry but I'm not interested. I thought about guaranteeing what's yours. Otherwise... I know that salaries are sacred but I'll need a few days... A few days? Are you kidding me? You leave us on the street and... we have to wait for our money. You?re unbelievable. You won't fool us. I'm no conman, kid. Do you know how hard it was for me to pay your salaries? I understand but I'm only asking for what's mine. If you want I'll work... Whatever... You tell me. Yes, but all I have is what you see here. Take it. And you can also take my car's tires. I'm taking the computer. What happened? I think I did something stupid... Look, I can't... It was something silly but... ...you know a lot about this... I can tell that you... Well, let's see. It's busy! Don't come in! What are you doing here? I've just seen you getting off your carriage. Who is he? Congratulations, very good. -You shouldn't be here. -I shouldn't? Who are you to say that? Stop it. Oro?o's outside. I don't give a shit about Oro?o! What? Are you sleeping with him too? So that's how you got the job. Why did you come? I came to ask you if you fucked the guy with the van. -What do you care? -"What do I care?" Bitch! You were with me yesterday! -Are you in love with me? -No, I'm not. What the hell do you want then? I can pay you half with "Bernalesa" credits. -What? -Credits from the barter's club. You go and trade them... ...for whatever you need. And... I can also... offer you their machines as payment. There's a professional oven, a "churro" maker, and... I think the machinery must cost about $1.000. -We'll do it. We'll do it. -When can you come? Give me... today... I'll be there before Sunday. Fine. -Give me the address. -Yes. And a key too. I don't want... ...to break the door. The keys. Can you call me before coming? As soon as I clear the place... ...I give you a call. Okay. The only thing is... I'm concerned about the little girl. Don't worry. We don't hurt anybody. Ok. What can we do? We'll have... ...to increase prices to support the factory. A little bit. No, Venancio. We can't. It's not selling well. If you walk and walk, if you double your effort you'll sell. I'm exhausted. Do you know how much I walk? Ask her. Nobody buys. Not even at $ 1.20. Okay, okay. Go, go, go. We don't want losers. You don't work anymore. -Who? Me? -Yes, you don't work anymore. Go, go. Out! Who is it? -Hello, Luli. -I made it for you. -For me? -It's great! It's... -Do you like it? -Yes. -What is it? -A monster. A monster? And what's this? Those are claws and they are bloody. Ah... it's... you're tough? -This is super nice. Thanks. -Bye. -Can I have a kiss? Thanks! Hi, how are you? Is Pato here? No she has already left. -Did she go to your place? -No, she's not staying with me. -And where is she? -I don't know. -She doesn't let you say it? She left 5 minutes ago towards the avenue. -See if you can catch her. -Fine, bye. -Bye. Let's go. Hello. You, Peruvian, get lost. I said get lost, asshole! Go! Where's your husband? Don't play fool. Where's he? You stay here. There you are, son of a bitch! Come on, man! We have to go! Please let me put some things together and we'll go. Out, out. Come on. Get lost. Put down the gun, please. Don't you see there's a child? Five minutes. Only five. Four, three... let's go. Take everything because you're not coming back. Yes, who is it? Hello. I'm looking for Patricia. Is she here with you? Yes. Hello. -Hi. -What's up? -Everything okay? -Okay my ass! You buttered my ear. Those things are mine. The PC... Were. They were yours. What do you mean? I'm telling you that's my PC. It was. You deaf? No, but this is not what we talked about. Good. I'm glad you notice this was not the deal. What do you want me to do with all these? Hold it, this was not our deal. No deal, man. You mean to take all my things away? This and that scooter... -...and we're even. -No, not the scooter. -Hold it, stop. -What are you doing? -Help yourself with a piece of bread. -The chicken is so good! Yes. Jose Luis,... ...in the name of my family I want to thank you. Thanks for letting us... ...stay and for sharing this meal with us. I say it from the bottom of my heart. We, Argentines, are losing this kind of gesture. You don't need to thank me. Yes, I do. Do you want some salad, Jose? Yes, thank you. -Pass me your plate. -No, I'll help myself... -Luli? -No. In 197 4 we had the factory... In 1975. -What? -In 1975. Patricia, honey, what year were you born? In 1975, dad. In 1975, "La Normanda" was... You have no idea. I'll get some napkins. It was one of the top companies in the food sector. Times were different. All of the supermarkets sold our "churros". We always started from the very bottom... Remember? -Yes. -Mom:? We sold them on the beach! People took it from our hands. -Incredible. Of course, times were different. -They were. -But we can do it again. -Do you think so? -I do. I do. I'll take it. Is it very heavy? -No, mom, I can carry it. -Are you sure?
