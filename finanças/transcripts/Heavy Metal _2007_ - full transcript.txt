- You're home already? - Yeah. Darling? Darling! Kake is outside again. Why the hell can't he ever just come straight in. You realize how stupid you look doing wheelies there in the snow? I brought the pictures. - They came already? - Sure did! Look! Really good. I can't believe this mask works so well. Let me see. What's this? You take pictures of Lego castles? How many are there? I had to finish the roll... Kake. You're going to secondary school soon. Take a look at yourself. I'm really trying to help you out here. - You need to be tougher. - Like how? Well like you can't expect the others to accept you right away. If someone gives you a hard time, you're just like: "Fuck, whatever". - Do people give you a hard time? - Of course not, everyone knows me. But it's different for someone like you. Look, this is a good picture of you. As if I care if it's good or not. The worse it is, the better. You look a bit like the singer of Kreator. - You mean Mille Petrozza? - Yeah. Like helll do. - You do, from that side. - What do you mean... Just looks really stupid... The next contestant... In which band did Dave Mustaine play before? - The guy from Megadet? - It's Megadeth, not Megadet. Stupid. In Metallica. - Really? - Yeah. Then they replaced him with Kirk Hammett. He used to play in Exodus. Do you remember what Megadeth's first album was called? Wasn't it "Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good"? Yeah. That was easy. Yeah. What about Stone's first album? Wait... Wasn't it just called Stone? - Yeah. That's an ace record. - I haven't heard it. Then we have to go and fucking listen to it. - It's really fucking great. - Do you have to swear all the time? Do you have to look like a fucking horse? Should we go and listen to that Stone? I don't want to anymore. It might get scratches. You should just go, I'm tired of looking at you. Okay then. - Whose moped is that? - That's just Hevari. - 2 and a half. - I'd give at least like 4 and a half. - Maybe 10. - Can you give that much? Let's give him 5. - Hi. - Hi. - Ossi? 5. - 4. - 4 and 1 from Mira. - Yeah. Where are the guys? - Not here yet. - Probably buying drinks or something. What are you doing? Well, we're just giving stars to the guys of the village. - Like for everyone? - No. Just the ones we're interested in. Definitely not for everyone. Weird... I'm going to buy something to mix the alcohol with. - You need some? - No. Look at the way he walks. Like he's all the time afraid of stumbling or something. That's true. If I see that guy again I'll tie him to the back of my Saab and drag him around. - Was he from Lahti? - I don't know... I once saw a man jerk off in the bus to Lahti. Sure thing Krisu, sure you did. - Well I did! - Yeah, as always. Hevari. Give me some. Okay. That's enough. - One day I'll kick your ass. - That I'd like to see. - You just wait. Come on... You're not kicking anyone's ass. You don't do that to friends. Let me go or I'll fucking kill you! Well well. Better hang on for a moment then. Is that really necessary? Let go now. Before he really gets hurt. Come on... We're just fooling around... Isn't that Makkonen? Fuck. He's got a new girl on the backseat again. Guys are so like that. If they cheat you once, they'll always cheat. - Like you'd know anything, Krisu. - More than you! - Like what, you've never been with anyone! - How do you know? - You don't know anything about my life! - Because there's nothing to know! I guess that's why you fucking lie all the time. - Fuck you! - Come on Krisu... To hell with little sisters... - Guys, really... Stop being like that. - We're not going anywhere! - Come on... - I'm not coming! Hevari will go with you. He's a nice guy. Hevari... Come with me to get Krisu. I really don't want to go alone. Please. Oh no. Mother. Who's there? Hello. Hello? Is Krisu home? - It's over 10 o'clock. - I know. I'm really sorry, but I just wondered if she could still come out. There's a disco and everything. Well come on in. What is it? I can't hear you. Tell that shit that I'll never talk to her again. She's throwing up out there. Is she? Good. She deserves it. What music do you listen to? It depends. All kinds. - That one is really good. - Yeah well... Their drummer is all right. I heard that sometimes bands like this don't even play themselves. But I saw them on the TV once and the drummer was really good. Hevari... What? I feel funny... Like how? Oh no! Come here! No, turn off the lights, turn off the lights! Are you asleep? Where did that boy go? - He left already. - Really? I was too tired to go anywhere anymore. Well tell him he shouldn't come this late. Your dad woke up and now it's hard for him to fall asleep again. Okay. I didn't want to explain anything. Should I turn on the lights? I don't know. Well, it's quite nice to be like this. Yes, it is. Wait, I'll put on some music. You, too. I like you. Did you hear me? Oh you want me to say it as well? I don't know. - Can I say it in English? - Yes. I love you. Hevari, are you coming? Ossi... Come here. Lift me up. - Are you leaving? - We're going inside. Wait, I'll come too. It's a fucking beautiful night. You know, this might be like the best time of our lives. I mean, this is quite all right. What do you think I'll be when I grow up? - What do you mean? - Like what do you think? I don't know... You could sell something. In some shop. Machines or something. What the fuck are we sitting here for? Let's go see what's happening inside. Hi. What? What what? What's with you? I was just thinking. About what? Well, I just don't know if I want this to get too serious. What? Yeah well you didn't really think this could work out, did you? Krisu! Hevari, you're hair is fucking awful. For how much would you cut it? Shit, for one mark. - You're not serious. - I am. - There you go. - Thanks. V?ke, give me that knife. - What are you... - Give it to me! Fucking hell. Let me see. Fucking hell! You're a cool guy, Hevari. Really. Let's get out of here. - Let's go somewhere and drink all night. - Yeah, let's go! Just the three of us, right? - I could fucking drink for a week. - We'll do that. Let's go to my place. - Let's go to your place. - My place it is. Just wait a sec, I'll come soon. Hevari... Fucking idiot! You have to think about other people's feelings, too! I've known a lot of assholes, but you're the biggest one! Fucking lunatic, let me go! You hear me! The biggest asshole! - Have you seen V?ke and Ossi? - No. We're going with these guys to Hartola, there's some party. See you later! Hi. Do you listen to Testament? What? Do you listen to Testament? Fuck do you care, I don't even know you! - No need to start shouting... - I shout as much as I fucking want! Fuck! What's happening here? Take it easy, it's all right. Yeah it's fucking all right, fucking bastards... Stay away from me! Are you going home? Do you want to go together? Hevari... You said that Megadeth's singer was the first guitarist of Metallica. But didn't Metallica's first guitarist die in some accident or something? What a stupid question. That was Metallica's second bass player. Cliff Burton. He died in a car accident in Sweden, in '86. And then came this... this Jason... - Newstedt. Right. - Right. Look here. - What's that on your neck? - Where? Did you hurt yourself? There. Look. No. There was this girl... You have a girlfriend or something? I don't know. We'll see. Okay then.
