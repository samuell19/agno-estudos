- Hey man. You guys hear of knocking? - Hey you guys ever hear of paying? - Man, I've been paying you when I can, every damn week. - You think we're some kind of fucking department store? I mean you bet a horse, he wins, we pay you. He loses, you pay. You lost, Sambo. Now pay it up. - Man you told me that I had time. You gave me time. - Sure I did, but then you started going down to the liqueur store laying bets with Moss. He's been loosing there. Now just who the hell do you think covers Moss? Huh? Me. I cover Moss. Well, now that you can't watch TV anymore, maybe you'll get off your ass and hustle up some cash. - What do you mean I can't watch TV? God damn! - Next week, papa. I'll expect a full bundle, next week. - Be seeing ya. - No one's going to respect you if you do not respect yourself. No one's going to help you. You have got to get it together by yourself, for yourself. Martin Luther King had a dream and it was blasted into eternity with him. I offer you reality. You've got to stand tall and demand your rights. Nobody's gonna give you a damn thing. The People's Army was established through a grant given by the white community. Blacks helping blacks with white money. Now you have turned your backs on your own police force. Dope pushers are feeding junk to your kids, and you sit back doing nothing. Gambling operations are forced upon black store owners and you say nothing. If we are to be considered as equals, if we are ever to receive our true place in this community, we must band together now. - Ah, General Ahmed. - How's he doing, doc? - Unstable. I wish we could do more, but we just don't have the equipment or the drugs. - The money. - Yeah, we'll get the money. - In a few hours it won't make any difference to him. - He's taken an overdose. And we're unable to test his blood. It's cripples helping cripples. - Okay. Get him to Martin Luther King Hospital. - That's wonderful. We preach no one will help us until we help ourselves and now we're still on our belly. I want to discuss the problem. - It's not time or place. - Whatever's right. - You keep pushing, and you'll need Martin Luther emergency. - I wonder if some day this whole damn town will need emergency. - I dig what you're doing baby. The only problem is is they're still takin' more than they're givin'. I'll see you tomorrow doc. - How about taking 10 milligrams of Valium and have a good night's sleep. - Don't need a crutch. Hang in there, doc. We're gonna do just fine. - I knew that black bastard would come up with it. - Uh huh. - Hey Vito, look at that. - All right. Come on. Hey. Where you goin', nurse? You feeling lonely? How about getting laid? Lookin' for a little extra bread, what you say? - Hey Vito, you ain't getting through. - Well look, honey, all you gotta do is tag deal, right baby. How about five bucks for a blowjob? Okay. Well 10 bucks is top for head. I never go more than 10 bucks for black head. - Black head. Sounds like some kind of pimple. - Now look here, honey, I know you got a price. And I know I've got the tear-up in my pocket right now. So why don't you just slow up for a minute, honey? Okay. I suppose you're a real class-- Now there's a real happy nigger. - She's all right. Just a little shaken up. - When? 5:30 this evening. She was walking home from a detoxification unit. - What about the young brother? - A ruptured spleen. He'll live. They messed up the job. He'll live. Now do you have time for me now, general? - Sit down. Sit down! What do you propose? - A security force. 20 men. I'll train them myself. Now if we can't stop the gangsters from working here, we can at least protect our people from their brutality. - Protection is one thing, but an all out war is something else. - Oh, come on now. - Look, I know you Kojah. You'd have this whole town into a furnace. Controlling the syndicate. It's a job of the LAPD. - And where was the cops when the sister was assaulted and a young brother was almost beaten to death? - Now you can't take the law into your own hands. - Your woman, Marsha was once your woman. Doesn't that make a difference to you? For protection, goddammit! I only want them for protection. Now you got something against taking care of your people? - Six men. You can have six men. The mission will be only to protect. They must never attack. Now you give me your word on that Colonel! - You have it. - Forces, 12,065. - Yeah, some dude hit his heavy on a long shot. - Well, you win a few, you lose a few. Anybody holding out? - A couple of old guys mad short. We're leaning on 'em. - Lean heavier. - Hardsta, 32, five. - they guys are hustling real good Vince. - No problems on the street whatsoever. - Well at least blacks like smack. How's the numbers doing? - 4,200. - What in the hell is wrong with you guys anyway? - Well they ain't holding back. We're just not pushing the bat as hard enough, Vince. - Okay, fine. So here's what we do. We set a quota for each store. They don't book enough bets, they make up the difference themselves. Got it? - You got it, Vince. - Whores, 19,650. - What the fuck is with you punks? You wanna cry unemployment? - Wait a minute, I think we got a hold back here. A Linda Casey. White chick. The figures the first week of July, 900. Second week, 1250, third week, 1100, fourth week, 1525. - She's sucked her little brains out, huh. - The week before last, 700, and this week only 500. - Who's her pimp? Ah, see if you guys can read my lips? Who is her pimp? - Willy Marsh. - Anybody know him? - Yeah, I know him. - Okay, Vito, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow, when you and Ernie go back to town, check out the whore first. Then you find her spook. Turn him upside down and see what falls out of his pockets, right. Yeah? - Boo! - You oughta quit smoking. Surgeon General says it can be bad for your health. Nice tits. Nice legs. Nice bush. You been holding out on us honey? - No. - That's good. 'Cause if you were, Ernest and I were gonna remove your tits, shorten your legs, and set your bush on fire. Now how many tricks did you take last week, honey? - I didn't keep track. - You didn't keep track? Now you know that you're supposed to hold a book. - Willie keeps the book. - So where's Willie? - I don't know. He hasn't been by since Tuesday. Jesus, I, I'm telling you the truth. I haven't seen him. I'd hate to have to break your jaw. That's gonna be half your action. But you give me bullshit baby. And Vito don't like bullshit. - I haven't kept a goddamn extra dime. I get 450 a week. That's all I get and that's all I take. - I said where's your pimp? - High Ed Club. He goes there for business. - When? - Tonight. He'll probably be there after eight o'clock. - You see how easy that was. Now you get to hang on to your tits. - See ya. You see him? - Eh. There's that nurse again. Pretty nigger, isn't she. - They all look alike to me. - What'll you have, gentlemen? - Double screwdriver. - A hard W Harper on the rocks. - Make mine a double too, will ya? You see Willie Marsh around? - Uh uh. - Sit down. - Say please, man. - Please. I want you to join me. - We've been through this bullshit before. Don't drag on my ass man. - I want six good men. Later they'll be more. - You're still dragging. - Within a week, maybe two. We'll be ready to make our move. - Your brain gone soft or something? Hmm? That jive ass nigger you work for, he gonna turn you loose? - I have money to start a security force, our force. You get others standing by. When I'm ready, I'll let you know. We'll make our move. It'll be our way, Delmay. Our way. Just like we planned. There's more shit out there to cut up than you have ever dreamed of. Our way, my man. In two weeks or less. - All right. Let's get it on. - We can come back for that pimp later. I'm gonna get me some of that. Hey blood, you gotta match? Okay, bitch, now scream your head off if you want to. But nobody's gonna hear you out here. - Okay. Rape me. Go ahead and rape me you honky bastard. This is more your style, isn't it. I bet this is about the only way you can get laid. Is he gonna help you get it up? - No bitch. This ain't my style. Let her go, Ernest. Let her go. - Oh Jesus. Oh. Oh. - Now bitch. This is my style. - Good afternoon. Would you care to? I'm hoping to get a celebrity to tell you about kidney disease. - All I want to know is who. - Does it make any difference? - It makes a difference to me, woman. Who? - You can't stop them. - Well baby, they gonna know we gave them a try. - I hope you're right. 'Cause I'm sure sorry for us if you're wrong. - Who? - Vito. The big one. - That's the way I like 'em. Big. Don't panic man. This will only take a second. - No. No. - Spread the word, you understand. The next time one of your punks touch a black woman again, I will personally flush the rest of you down the same toilet. Lieutenant Kona, call an ambulance. This man is bleeding to death. - What is it? - Vince, I gotta talk to you. - What time is it? 3:30. I'm sorry to bother you, Vince, but we gotta big problem. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Jesus Christ. - Shut up. All right, what is it? - Hey, we got a big problem. - Who said that? - Well Vito's in the hospital. Doc said he almost bought it. - What happened? - Bunch of niggers jumped him. The People's Army group. They, well they cut his nuts off. - They what? - What's going on anyway? - Shut up and go back to sleep. - Who could sleep with all this talking going on? - Stick your fingers in your ears. Cut his nuts off? How come? - Well, they must have got pissed because we was jacking up the betting payments. - I didn't think they had that much guts. Wait a minute, you guys weren't supposed to start that 'til tomorrow. - Well, early this evening, we ran into a couple of their bookies at the bar and we started setting it up. And well like I said, they must've got pissed. - Really wonderful. I could've had Harlem. I wanted sunshine, swimming pools. Okay, there's no way we can let this lie flat. I mean they made a call on us and we gotta answer, right. We let them push us around like this and the next thing you know, they'll be pushing harder, right. - Whatever you say, Vince. - That's right. So what we gotta do is lean on them. I mean not much, just a little. I don't want a fucking war, you understand? So what we do is we keep the collections up. And we lean. And that's it. Hmm? You take care of that. Son of a bitch. His nuts! - Let's see the numbers, pal. - 2850. - Okay, 2850. Your quota is 35, you owe us 550. - 650. - What? - My quota is 35. 2850 from 35 is 650. - Okay, 650. - I don't have it. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that I'm tapped. Broke. Short of funds. Hard up. Impoverished. Stripped. Beat. Besides, I don't have 650 to spare for shit like you. - What the fuck are you talking about, donkey? - Hey. You guys here to buys a set or rent one? - You shot one of my soldiers. You see, we got a new deal now. You shoot one of my soldiers, then I shoot one of your guerrillas. Now you get him out of here. Bleeding all over my friend's floor. From now on, we'll be taking the gambling money. You don't have to worry about them anymore. Everything gonna be just fine. - How come you're not workin'? Got a couple of customers waiting out side. Where's the bread? - I don't have it. - Well what the hell does that mean? Give me the cash. - I don't have any money. - You're gonna be wearing your nose behind-- - Scrape your garbage off the street on the way out. - What the hell hit you guys? - It was that jackass black army group. We were gonna pound a few head like you said and they jumped us. We never even made our rounds. Lou took Eddie to the hospital. They broke his fucking finger. Jack's all right. - Oh yeah, he looks just great. Where's Willie? - He got shot. I had to leave him with Doc Meyers. - What do you mean shot? - Coldest goddamn thing I ever saw. This big black nigger turns and fires. Got him in the belly. Doc Meyers said he may not make it. - Well? Lay it on me. - They threw Phil out the window, broke his fucking neck. I had to leave him there. - What the hell is happening anyway? - They're stacking up on us Ernie. Maybe we oughta cool it for a while. - Bull shit. Now we're gonna go back to town right now and get our money. No bunch of niggers are gonna push me around. Afternoon black gentlemen. I's here for our collection. - Easy white boy. - Back off now. You don't want to get too close to that man's razor. He like to get cut up. - Joe. You take the rest of the fellas and go out and make your pickups. Keep your guns handy. - Okay, Ernie. - Now. Let's have it. Now you spread the word boy. I'll chop 10 of yours down for every one of mine. Spread the word. - Ho. - Any trouble Joe? - Like a turkey shoot. - I guess they got my message. You're the last one in. I reckon I'll head on over the hill. See you tonight. - Right. - Hi there. I can't hear you. What the fuck you doing? Oh. Who the hell is up there? Hey I don't want no trouble, okay. I'll give you my gun. All right, here it is. I'm gonna come out with my hands up. Hey what the fuck's with you. Hey, I already said I don't want no trouble. - You already got trouble. Throw out the money and I won't shoot your white ass off. - You got it. It's a deal. Here. Here it is. Here's some. Hold your fire now. Here's some more. Some more. There. Okay. Here comes the last one, all right. All right now, here I come. What the fuck's with you? I already said I don't want no trouble. Hey you guys nuts? Hey. We made a deal. - The deal was I wouldn't shoot your white ass off. - Come on, you fucking bastard. I gave you the pad. Now let out of here. Goddammit. Stop it. This fuckin' things gonna-- - Okay, honky, you can come out now. - Is that what you assholes are telling me? A bunch of niggers is driving me out of town? Is that it? Huh? Is that what you're telling me, a bunch of niggers? - They leaned on us real hard, Vince. - Oh now that's a real fucking shame, innit. All right, fine. Now you all heard me say no rough stuff, right. No hard stuff. Huh? - Right. - So who threw the bomb in the restaurant? Well that is wonderful. I mean that is really wonderful. Gah, don't worry about it. What the hell, huh. So we blow a million dollar operation. I mean there's always something else, right. More money, more deals, right. I mean so they kill me. So they blow my brains out. I mean like the man says, you gotta die sometime, right. But I'll tell you what, you son of a bitch, if I have to go, I will see to it that you go first. Okay. Fine, okay. Here's what we do. We gotta cut out of town for a while until things cool down. You guys go home. Cool it. And I'll call you when things get set up. All right? Go. Joe. I just don't want you to feel that I don't like you. - Yeah, Vince. - See, it's just that I think you're the dumbest fuck in the world. - Thanks, Vince. - You're welcome, Joe. Maybe I could still get Harlem. - Over three acres. Tennis court in the rear. Swimming pool in the front. Guest house with enough room to bunk 40 troops. Main house, 12 to 15 officers if we build petitions. - Looks good. Very good. Delmay, you have just become a major. We'll set up our training injury at the tennis court. How many men are scheduled for the first training cycle? - We'll have 95 by Friday. - Excellent. Set up the tennis court for classroom instruction and basic karate. That area should also work well for close order drills and serve as our parade ground. We'll break the first cycle into three platoons. I'll have our basic training procedures scheduled within a few days. - Right. Any preference on platoon commander? - You handle that major. The main house, the pool area, will serve as our BOQ and officer's club. I want our men treated well, major. Officers and enlisted men alike. You look good. You really look good. Help yourself. - All right. - How'd it go? - Broads are good. Grass is cool. Got a few complaints with the whores who type too much. But it told him we'd see cleaner next week. - Numbers and cards are low though. - I don't think the stones are pushing. - Oh that's easy. From now on, give each shop a minimum. If they don't sell enough, they'll just have to make up the difference themselves. - Right. - We'll continue to train our troops until we have a combat force that no one can stop. I want to change our uniform. I want it to be something distinctive. And we will also change our white man name to Swahili. I will be Kiongozi, which means leader. You will be my warrior, Askari Hodari When one of our men walk down the street, the people will know who we are. We will establish security around our headquarters that will be impossible to penetrate. I want to set up two more hidden locations exactly like this one. Emergency food rations will be maintained there at all times. Work them hard. Push them to the very end of their endurance. I want my army to be ready for anything and everything that comes its way. No one will stop us. No one. Whether they live or die is not the question. Whether they win or succeed is the only answer. - Left face. - My warriors. You have done well, trained hard. I'm proud of you. And soon, I promise you we will be strong enough. And when that time comes, we will expand. We will move form the ghetto where we have been sentenced. The white community will feel our power. They will pay dearly to hold us back. We'll descend upon them with strength. They will feel our vengeance. - Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. - Oh General Ahmed. Would you sign this requisition? You look tired. - Don't tell me you're seeing big black circles under my eyes. What time are you getting off? - Don't tell me you're gonna walk me home because it isn't safe out there. - Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. - Forget it. What makes you think you can walk in here and do this to me? I haven't been alone with you for over three weeks. - Tonight's the night. - Hello? - Hello Marsha. This is Doctor Lisk. Some kids have thrown a bomb through our window. No on has been seriously hurt. - For god's sake why? - Well, words out that there's a new group formed in town that plans to fight the People's Army. I just never thought they'd hit us here. - Fight us? What for? We got rid of the syndicate. - Babe, your head's been in a battle. This city's worse off now than it was before the army took over. Now the army's running more prostitution through here, drugging our people more than ever. Why the army puts it in them, and the army pays us to push it out. The People's Army is running everything. - All right, doctor. I'll get down there right away. Out! Get out of my house, General! - What's with you, Marsha? You're schizoid? - That's it. I'm schizoid. - Okay. You got it. Must have been snoring too loud, huh. - You stop being funny on the day you started dealing dope. - What the hell you talking about? - They bombed our clinic. - Who bombed the clinic? - Some people who got fed up to here with the lies you've been feeding them. - I swear to god woman, I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't, do you. Well that makes you just about as dumb as me. - Maybe so. - Well, it would appear, General, as if your men are pushing more drugs than we ever had before. And tonight, tonight some soul brothers finally got fed up and started to fight back. - No, I didn't know. But I intend to find out. - General Ahmed, General Ahmed, would you care to comment based on reports that your People's Army is involved in a blood war in Watts? - Well I have no idea who was involved in the shootings that took place. However, my staff and I are presently conducting a thorough investigation. And should any of my people be involved, they will immediately be turned over to the proper authorities. - General, we understand that because of charges, that you and your People's Army are involved in a black/white war that the state of California has suspended it's grant to you. Is that true? - Well, our grant has been temporarily suspended pending further investigation. - And isn't it also true, General, that means that the governor himself has been charged with financing a race war in Watts and that's his reason for withdrawing his support. - Neither the governor nor I know who was involved. I agree with his decision to withhold financing. The problem will be solved. Now gentlemen, if you will excuse me. - General, one more question please, one more. Now we understand that $10,000 a week has been channeled through your organization ostensibly to help the people of Watts. Now please answer this question truthfully. If any of that money had been diverted to start a race war in Watts, wouldn't you be the first one to know it? - All I know is that $10,000 a week to help the people of Watts is not enough. - But General. All right fellas, that's a wrap. - He just went left on Central, on to third. Moving north. - I'm on him. This is control. Clear. Okay, monkey in the tree. You wanna open the gate? Or do I ram my way through? I'm General Ahmed. And I want to see Kojah. Now! - Officer Delmay, this is post one. Officer Delmay, post one. - What do you got, one? - General Ahmed is at the front gate to see General Kiongozi. Please advise. - Let him through. - Pass him on, one. - You'll have to submit to a search, General. - Do I have a choice? - Turn around and spread 'em. Put 'em up. General Kiongozi will see you now. - Kiongozi? Is there some place we can talk? - Sit down, Ahmed. Make yourself at home. This is my chief of staff, Colonel Askari Hodari. Would you like a drink? - General Kiongozi? Colonel Askari? - Hodari. - Hodari. Seems to be some promotions and different names I haven't heard about. Seems to be a lot of changes I haven't heard about. - Glad to meet you, General. I have long been an admirer of yours. - Let me hear it from your lips. Have you been running dope and prostitution in our city? - What I do from this point on is of no concern of yours. - And will you deny that you are a liar for your new name, you should have chosen nyoka, snake. - General, you are in my count. This is now my army and we are at war. Now I suggest you conduct yourself in a manner befitting your situation. - You jive ass nigger. You've been shit from the very beginning. - All right. Now you listen to me. I don't want to waste you only because I feel sorry for you. You and every other do gooder like you. Where you wrong, and you've always been wrong is that you fight with weakness and begging. We are fighting with strength. We will win. Now I will give you enough money for your food and your clinics, nothing more. You go feed the poor, General. That's what you're good at. - And you feel sorry for me? Why you arrogant son of a bitch. Now you keep your money! I don't deal in dirty money. I'll find another way to feed the poor. Now may I be excused? - You stay out of our way, Ahmed. - He is trouble! - I doubt it. It'll take him months to recruit enough new people to hassle us. Baby, we can handle any fucking thing that comes our way. - What's happening, man? - There's an additional. Water please. There's an additional third, the same spot. - You got to be kiddin' man. I still got stash left from last week. - Then you better get it together man. - Man, the heat is on. - You're getting big money for a big job. Nobody's getting 10% of the street but you. - Listen man, one more bust for me and that means 10% of the rest of my life. I've got to have more time. - So? - What do you mean so, man? - We made a deal. You keep it. Move the contents of that bag like we agreed. - Man, give me a break. - I make a bad report on you brother, and you'll wish you were in the slammer. Get your shit brother. You got work to do. Shit. - What is it? - It's Askari Hodari. - Later man. - Now! - I said later. - It's important I see you now. - Cover yourself. All right major, you can come in. - Maybe we should talk alone. - We are alone. - Some of General Ahmed's men just popped my trunk and ripped off this week's dope supply and last week's collections. - You sure it was Ahmed? - Yes. - When? 5:30 this afternoon. - Broad daylight? That took guts. - Are you ready to hear more? Then Lieutenant Parker tells me they short stopped this week's gambling collections. Over half the stores in town were close today. Now I'll go in tomorrow, but we better be looking for trouble. It's Ahmed. You know goddamn well it's Ahmed. - Been wanting this for a long time, haven't ya? - You're goddamn right I have. - Why? - Because his way is wrong. And you know it's wrong. - Waste him. - Right on. Sorry General, you've just committed suicide. Get out. Start walking. You wanna turn around and see it coming, or do you wanna get it in the back? If the bullet didn't get him, the fall sure in hell did. Let's get out of here before someone reports the shots. Now what do you think this is mama? A labor holiday? - I've been sick. I haven't felt good. They cut my ration. - Well now you know the rules. You get what you pay for. And you've got an expensive habit. - If I had some, I'd be fine. - Oh yeah. You just keep working that little ass of yours and you'll have all you want. - But I don't know where Willie is. If he had a customer here, I'd do it. I just don't know where he is. - Well now, we have five of my good men here. They've been working real hard. They could use a relaxation. - All right. - You are the second company to graduate from this academy. What you have worked hard for, what you have learned will soon serve as a lesson to any who might attempt to stop us from achieving our goals. And those who might step in our way, we declare vengeance. - Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance. - Hey you fellas, I'm doing the best I can. You guys are draining me blind. If this goes on, I gotta close the fuckin' place up. - Now I've been patient. And you've been jiving. I ain't got time for bullshit, you understand. Spread the word. I'm through with jiving around. - Here's $400 and a list of supplies that I need. I want them back here in about four or five days. No questions, please Eddie. You got it? - You leaving? - Yes. - Take me with you. - No. What I have to do, I have to do alone. - Yeah. I guess you can run faster without me than with me. - All right, all right. Here's a piece of pig for everybody. - Better move your ass solider. - All right, formation right here. Gentlemen, my name is Captain Weha. And I have been placed in charge of your next phase of training. It is at this point that we will separate the men from the boys. This will be an endurance run. You will continue driving yourselves until you can go no further. Should you fail and fall to the side, a truck will pick you up. However, I have deep hopes none of you will fail. Left haste. Double time, ha. Bye bye you mothers. Toss your guns down boys. Maybe y'all's dumb enough to outdraw me. - Fall in. Ready. You are the second guard of the day. Keep your eyes and ears open. Ready, face. Forward, march. - What the hell was that? Check it out. - What the fuck's happenin'? - Throw the gun in the pool, muthafucka, or I'll make you sink like a rock. - Well, well. The pussycat has finally grown fangs. - They were always there. - Now I suppose you intend to go back to town and help all those poor people. - I intend to keep on trying.
