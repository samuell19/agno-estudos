My love to you was like a 18 layered cake. In every layer there was a different fruit. But the most delicious fruit was you. 13th floor, please. Hello, ma'am! We have a 18-storey hotel. Every storey is beautiful. Which floor, ma'am? I already said 13th, sir. Right. What are we waiting for? When the elevator is full we'll ride up. Hello, sir. -Which floor? -17th, please. We'll wait for the elevator to be full. Is this a jitney minibus? What do you mean by that? I just follow the orders, sir. Why are you looking at me like that? Get in, man. Come on, man! Oh, God! Ladies and gentlemen, hold tight. We're riding up! FROM NALETBEBE WONDERFUL DREAMS Ömer, what the hell, man? Are you riding a jitney minibus or something? What do you mean by not riding the elevator until it's full? This is a five star hotel! They told me it's a four star. What if it's a four star? -Get out, man! -Man? You're being rude now. -Sedat. -You call me Sedat now, huh? Not sir? You're fired! You are firing me? Well, I came here to resign anyway. Fire me, huh? Fire me till morning. We have updated the menu, Manager, sir. So what, man? Look at him. Look at his outfit. You're making them wear these clothes but someday someone will come for them. Sedos! Ismet, how are you doing, man? Hello, Ömer. The usual, man. Working, you know. How are you? Have you taken a break? Nope. Not a break. I just resigned. You break your back for a firm, you work up a sweat everyday but they won't tolerate even the slightest mistake you make. Didn't you start to work here this morning, man? So what, man? If a person, a corporate mentality do this on your first working day, can you imagine what they'll do in the coming years? There're a lot of offers anyway. I'll consider them. What offers? NASA called me. They said they appreciate my elevator lifts. They want me to ride a rocket. I'll go there to ride a rocket. Are you being serious? I just pulled your leg. I think you went haywire while trying to collect valet fees. Be well. Take care, Ismet. See you. Rasit, man, what up? Ömer, how are you, man? To hell with your advice, man. What the heck does it mean not ride the elevator until it's full? They fired me. What do you want from me? I am a minibus driver for as long as I can remember. Of course that would be my professional advice. You have a point. Why don't you give me a ride home? Hop in. -I don't have any money though. -Get on, man. Hop in. We are "Ankaraite" till death! Ankara is a passion We never left anyone in the lurch they got off the minibus voluntarily Why don't you get off? Why are you looking me right in the eye? You're making me nervous. Listen, man. Don't you think we work well in tandem? Didn't you see how people were satisfied with the service? Why don't I work with you? What do you say? I'll work for you for just 2500 Liras? I won't claim benefits. What do you think, man? Are you joking, Ömer? Well, bus drivers have assistants. Minibus drivers can have them too. I am already exhausted from heat, man. Don't push my buttons. Get off, man! Go on! All right then. Go on! What's up, man? -I'm good. What's up? -Fine. Take it easy, man. -Thanks. -I just got off work. Hello! Oh my! Ömer, what's up with the outfit? Don't tell me you have become a Janissary band member. Edip, man! I'm just working on something new. To show my mood I made this costume. You're funny, Ömer. I see my paper has arrived. It has, Ömer. Of course it has. Here you go, son. They really improved it. Soon it'll be glossy too. -I'm leaving. -Let me buy you a glass of tea. -My mom is waiting for me. -Your mom? -Have a good one. -Good bye! Ömer? How is your mother doing? Is she okay? -My mother? -How is your mother? Am I asking you about your mother? You can, son. Go on, ask about my mother. Why should I ask about your mother, Edip? You ask about my mom every time I come here. Good God! From now on you won't ask about my mother, nor I about yours. Why did you get worked up, son? I have a reason to ask about your mother. He's obsessed with my mother. Ömer? What's up, Kubra? -How are you? -Fine. How about you? I'm fine too. The outfit really suits you. Thank you. Thanks. Is she crazy or something? I bump into her wherever I go. It suits me? My foot! They printed in minuscule fonts again. How can a person read it? I gave promises to myself All flashy I have an animal in me Very noisy I have buzzed around frantically My love to you is Very insulated What do you mean by "insulated"? -Like jacketing? -Very funny. You got it. Even if just a bit. Mom! You know our neighbor is insulating their building. I think he took inspiration from them. What gives? Both you and mom are screwing around with me this morning. Mom, please don't laugh. Why don't you take me seriously? Don't you think I have a right to communicate my feelings? Son, what would happen if it was a full page print? They don't have much money, so they print just ten of it in total. You buy one of them, and the other nine prints are used as a table cover. Why are you laughing, girl? Why are you laughing, huh? Wipe the cheese on your mouth first! You, useless girl! I'm off. Hey, hold on. Where are you off to? Shouldn't you be at work now? -Well? -They fired me. But ask me why? Okay. Why? Mom, the manager called me in. He read my poems. He said he couldn't believe the strong emotions I have, all that suffering. He said he cried his eyes out till morning. He said “Ömer, I can't keep you here. You have a promising future. Just go with the flow.” You mean you did everything to get fired. That's what he said. I swear I didn't do anything wrong. Yeah right! No way! Can you ever do something wrong? It was wrong of me to give you birth! Go on, tell me you don't give me your blessings either! Dear God! I'll buzz off. What are you writing, man? How old are you, -kid? -I am 17, bro. You see this notebook here. All my emotions and my flowing passions are in it. -All is in here. -Are you a poet? You see me in a black t-shirt and you take me for a comedian, huh? Man, your poem has no measures or rhymes. What are you talking about, man? What do you know about measures or rhymes anyway? You think you are Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan? Look at you with those weird earrings. Sod off! He has a screw formed earring! In this age it's all about easy money. If you make easy money somewhere don't you ever let it go. -Am I mistaken? -Look at it, man. She made 4 million Liras from this book. 4 million Liras! There are just a couple of sentences in each page. I'm missing you. I miss your smell. -And so on. -4 millions, you said? That's a lot of money, man. That's what the audience demands then. If they want to be exploited, you should give them what they want. -Where the hell is Ömer? -Here he comes. What's up? Good, man. What's up? What is it, man? You're puffing and blowing. I got into a battle of words in the bus. -Really? -Yeah. I see that you're all right. Nothing happened to you right? What can happen to me? Nothing can happen to a poet. Are still insisting on being a poet? Haven't you done with that? -Have you ever done with breathing? -No. I am not done with writing poems, Ali. I don't know, man. You used write poems on desks in high school. He wrote a romantic poem on an English test paper in senior year. Right! And the next day he got into a fight with English teacher's husband in the schoolyard. He didn't deserve that woman. Weren't you taken into custody for a day? Her husband happened to be a prosecutor. How could I known that? You know what? It was good for me. I wrote great poems that night. -What great poems? -Listen. I didn't tell about them until now. Prison bars are cold The guards are dull He burnt himself out Although he's just a 17 year old kid Ömer, is it always in your pocket? Some poems are always with you. Some are in your storage. Storage? Do you have enough poems to put out a book of poetry? Just a book? Many books, man. Mind you! I used it in plural. I mean, I have a lot. Okay? A lot of poems. All right. What will you drink, guys? -I'll have tea. -Yeah. Tea please! Hey, chief, get us some tea, man! We're thirsty. -See you, man. -Bye. -Give us a call me, man. -Right. I will. Ömer, my man. I really missed you. Let's keep in touch. High school friendships are something else. You know what? I missed you, too. -You know what the poet said? -What did he say? Once a friend always a friend Death means nothing, my beloved. -Which poet is that, man? -Yours truly. -Go on then. -See you. No one can hold a candle to you when it comes to Turkish omelet, Mom. Bon appetite, son. Enjoy! Ömer, look. You know Edip. He needs an assistant in the shop. I talked with him. He said he can hire you. What shop, Mom? That guy is obsessed with you. He keeps asking about you. He's nonsensically possessive of you. Dear God! I swear I'll kill him. Then people will call me "Killer Poet"! Stop talking nonsense! You are a 30 year old man. Aren't you ashamed of taking pocket money from your mother? Sometimes I am. But then I think it was her decision to give birth to me. I become an insensitive beast. But I really don't mean to, Mom. I wish you didn't give birth to him. I really wish. You depleted all her vitamins. What is it to you? Why are you putting your nose into? Runt of the litter! Mom, please give me a break. How can this sensitive soul and body be productive? How can he communicate his feelings, Mom? Give me some time. What productivity are you talking about? Look. What is this? It's an egg. This egg is more valuable than your productivity. Idiot! Where are you going? To lay eggs. Easy, man! Prick! You just need to put the ball into a hole. We don't even have a female company here. You beast! Look at him! The third page poet. Why are you shouting at people? This is a billiard saloon. They can play pool as they want. What is it to you? I spent my teenager years in this place. All boys in my neighborhood became a man here. They should be appreciative of -this place. -Right! Things didn't go well for the saloon then. I remember having to stash away liquid soap. Never knew why it used to run short quickly. No, in fact I knew. That's what bothers you now? I mean is it really the place to say that? I need go and run some errands. You are in charge of the saloon. Okay? No worries. Be careful, lads. Don't rip the cue bag! They slammed the door in my face It was a steel door A song plays in the background sang by Celik! You sweet girl, Oh you sweet girl, Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are, I wonder. -Hello? -Mate! Where are you? I'm in Deep Loneliness, Ali. You don't say! And where's that? It's the billiard saloon in our neighborhood. Will you send me your location? I'm on my way. Will do. Okay. Hey! You animal! What kind of a pique is that? If Adem sees that pique and if you tear up the cloth on the table he will tear you into pieces Ömer, if you know how to shoot come and show me, man. What are you talking about? What? What are you talking about? Now, watch and learn. This technique is called Bruce Lee. You put it in between your toes. Back then we didn't have those gloves. I put it here so that it won't slip. See? It's tight. There, I gripped it. I gripped it again. Now I let it go. Look! Watch my move. See? It slides. Here it comes. Here it comes. I shoot and pull it back. See? Yeah, I see. Here, take it. No! Take it from here. Mate! What's up, man? Nothing, man. What's up? Have you missed me? Of course I have, man. My mom doesn't miss me. Why do you miss me, man? We'll publish your book of poetry, Ömer. It'll be a bestseller, man. We'll earn 4 million Liras. -4 millions Liras, you say? -Yeah! -It's a nice sum. -That's exactly what I said. -To whom? -Well, to myself. I still take pocket money from my mom. 20 Liras, man! 20 Liras! What 4 million are you talking about? You really have no vision, Ömer. I know the owner of the publishing house. The printing house said they're game. If not 4 million, then 200 thousand. Still an okay sum. From 4 million to 200 thousand. It's an extreme decline. What kind of a vision you have? But you know what? 200 thousand made some sense. Don't worry! I'll take care of everything. Trust me. Keep me posted. -Let me know, man! -All right. See you. Call me! Partner, choose the best ones. See you, babe! Ömer? Oh, man! What? Were you waiting for me? Not really. I was going home, man. I thought you were waiting for me. Here you go. My poems. Are they ready? They were at home. I brought them to you. That's great. -When will they put it in print? -Mate, I'll publish the book in two days. No worries. Look, man. Those poems mean a lot to me. -Please be careful with them. -Don't worry, big man. These poems will make us rich. Ali? I don't intend to be rich. I just want to make my poems known. Will you leave the charlatan tradesman mentality aside? All right, Ömer. Anything else? Nothing. Stay with the poems! Kisses, Ömer. Ömer? Why are your poems so bleak? What kind of experiences have you had in life? Is it an earthquake? I stole 300 Liras from mom to hire a car. I wanted to take Esra for a ride. I took her from her home, we went for a drive. Then I parked in a secluded place. I wanted to give her an innocent kiss. -Innocent kiss, huh? -Right. An innocent one. As I made a move to kiss her, she gave me a hard slap. Good for her. Obviously she's a virtuous girl. I wish she tore you apart. Esra? Ömer, what is it, man? You're close to tears suddenly. It's nothing. I'll call you. -Hello? -Good morning, big boy. -Why are you calling me? -I've been working till morning. But there's a hitch with the printing process. -What hitch? -Well, I promised them a share of the book sales. But they demand a small sum beforehand. -Well, how much do they want? -5 thousand will be enough. You don't say! What 5 thousand, man? I don't have it on me. Do you ever have 5 thousand on you? Hang up. Let me see. Hang up, man. Where can I get 5 thousand from? Mommy! You, jerk! You're an animal! Who wakes someone up like that? God! I am scared to death! Look, look. Look what I prepared just for you. Where did this come from? We had a row yesterday. I wanted to say sorry. My beautiful boy. My darling. My lamb! Ömer, you really worry me a lot, son. Mom, we have no one but each other. Sometimes I am angry with you, sometimes you are angry with me. I can get angry at you anytime now. My beautiful son, do I really want much from you? I just want you to support yourself. I want you to earn your keep. I want you to have your own house. Then I want you to get married. I mean before I am gone. Do you want all of those things to come true? Evidently! I wouldn't say them otherwise. Then give me 5 thousand Liras. What 5 thousand? What do you mean? Mom, you know my book of poetry. It's in printing process right now. There's a small hitch. I need just 5 thousand. -What book are you talking about? -Mom, a publishing house has been after me for months now. Finally I said yes. Now it's being printed. I just need 5 thousand. It's really a small sum. I'll pay you back in two days. A publishing house? -They have been after you for months? -Right. Hey! That publishing house doesn't have 5 thousand Liras to print your book? Right. You do have a point. You're right. But why don't you give me anyway? Just 5 thousand. My sweet mother… My dear mother… Just look me in the eye. You look me in the eye. Look! I don't have 5 thousand Liras! You haven't even saved for your funeral, Mom? -You really don't have any? -Enough! You're making me crazy! Go on! Ali? I have the money, man. Where are you? Yeah, I know that place. I'll be there. We'll go to the hairdresser. We need to have his photos taken. Then we need to buy a suit. They won't cost 5 thousand. Hello, mate. Ali, what's the catch here? You tell me we'll make 4 million, but they won't start unless we give them 5 thousand? I paid a lot to the publishing house. Why would I bother you for a small sum like that? Am I a cheapskate? Chief, please do your work properly. It is very important to me. I'll print it. Don't you worry. I am on it. Ömer, since you're here… What will be the title of the book? The title of the book… “Poet who published his book with his mom's savings for her funeral” -Are you serious, man? -I am. Give him his money. Chief! Hey! Why did you give him 3 thousand and put the rest in your pocket? It's not all about writing poems. We need to take care of your image. Suit and whatnot. Trust me, man. I took care of everything. We'll get your photo taken for the book cover, man. Come on, man. Come on! Hey, chief, the title for my book is… Wonderful Dreams. Please print it properly. I told you not to worry. I'll print it. He's a very enthusiastic print man. Come on, man. We have work to do. Come on! -Well! -Well! Ömer, you see this guy? Whoever he laid his hands on has made it big time! Yalin, Burak Ozcivit, Ilhan Mansiz and many famous people. I always liked Ilhan Mansiz's hair style in the 2002 World Cup. Great! That's wonderful. You'll be very handsome. My friend here told me about you. I'll make a machine out of you! -What machine? -Sex machine! Poem machine! Let's get him seated and get on with it. I don't look like a poet at all, man. I look like a break dancer in Karanfil Street. Not at all, mate. It's because you need to get used to it. And you need to complete your hair style with accessories. You'll turn heads! You'll turn many heads! He lost it, man! Okay, man. Wear them now. Ali? You keep doing this. We're not shooting a film here. Go on! Get on top of the lioness. -Get on top of her. -Am I the lioness here? Get on with it. Not like that. A little bit lower. A bit more. Just a tad lower. -All right. -Is it okay, man? Is this okay? Get off me! -Get out, man. -Just a sec! You are obviously nutty. You exposed all your perversions, man! Good God! What are doing licking a bagel, man? I work my guts out for your book, yet you lick your bagel not to share it with me. Damn you, babe! No, man. It's just a nasty habit of mine. What did you do? Here you go. Your book! -Off the print already? -It is. Wow! It's really off the print! How many did they print? Is it available in all the bookstores? Easy, man. We should keep a cool head. -How many prints? -A hundred. You're joking. But I bought it. I'm not joking, man. Seriously. I told you that we'd keep cool. Just a hundred? I have at least 75 relatives. A hundred of them is not enough! Wonderful Dreams has 100 prints in its first edition. There are only 100 people who could buy your book in the whole world. People will fight with each other to get it. What do you mean? They'll scramble for it? They will! Why don't you trust me, man? Just get up early tomorrow morning. Be ready at noon. What for? Couldn't you guess? You wouldn't want to be late for your autograph session, right man? Really? I love you, man! You rascal! Let me have this one. I'll present it to mom. -I want her to be proud of me. -All right, Ömer. I'm off. See you tomorrow. Bye, man. Did you steal that bicycle, man? I borrowed it from the lads in my neighborhood. Watch out, Ali! Mom! What happened to your forehead? Why don't you go home? You're here every night. Don't your parents tell you to go home? Sukran invited me and I accepted her invitation. What is it to you? Shall I ask for your permission before inviting someone? You don't do anything worthwhile! You just crack sunflower seeds and you gossip. Look! How dare you talk to my guest like that? It's nothing, my idiot sister Rahime. I just slept on it. So? What is it? Right. My dear mother and dear Kubra, and my not-so-smart-sister Rahime. It's a beautiful day for me. Go on. What's going on? Ta-da! What is this? Obviously it's a book. But I don't understand why there's a picture of you on the cover. Why, I wonder? Ömer, did you publish a book? That's right, Kubra. Since my teenager years I put down all the emotions and passions on paper, and finally it has become a book. That's nice. What happened to your hair? What do you think? It's snake, right? What snake? You look like a pervert who takes a fancy to a big size water bottle. Tonight, once again a young lad got humiliated in front of a neighbor's daughter. Thank you. Mrs. Sukran? I mean it. Thanks a lot. Listen. I have an autograph session tomorrow. Get all your stupid friends there. I want it to be crowded. Where are you going? You took 5 thousand from me. You said you'd pay me back. Yeah, why don't we bring up that? Let's bring up that in front of our neighbor, Kubra. I have no privacy left. Dear God, I beg you, please answer my prayers for him. Dear God, please help me out in my first autograph session tomorrow. Give me strength so that I can reach out to millions. Amen. Everybody! Come to the autograph session of the famous poet who portrays the broken hearts and pangs of love most beautifully. Ali, come here! What the hell, man? Am I a pair of boxers? Are you selling boxers in a bazaar? Why are you shouting like that? God! What did you expect, man? I certainly didn't expect this! Look at this. Are we selling subscriber lines or something? We should have been inside a mall, or a bookstore. -Or an exhibition hall. -Isn't it nice, man? -I even decorated it with balloons. -We are like peddlers here. Keep the change. Man, I'm sure you're hungry. Hunger makes you tense. Here you go. Eat, man. -What is this? -Turkish cig kofte. Not a meat kebab? Or at least a chicken kebab? Cig kofte and buttermilk for 3 Liras. I only deserve them, huh? Jerk! I trusted you, man! Ömer, have a good day. How is your autograph session going? Hello, Kubra. Why are you here? I wanted to support you in your autograph session. All right. Thank you. -What? You want a book? -Yeah. I'll give one to mom and she can give it to you. But you visit her everyday. I'll leave the book onto the table in the living room. Get it from there. Okay. All right. Have a good day. Thanks. Take care. Let me eat cig kofte. Are you a youtuber, bro? -What did you say, my dear? -Youtuber. No, buddy. I am a poet. Did you buy my book? -Fatso! -What did you call me? Look at yourself in the mirror. Look at yourself in the mirror. Fatso! Look at how you run, fat boy! I swear I'll lose it. Come here! I'll beat the hell out of you! You idiot! I'm a laughing stock because of you. I'm leaving. -What... -Fatso he says! You are the fatso! I decorated it with the balloons. I got a permission from the mall for the stand. You can't expect a long queue of people on the first day. You just can't, man! Ömer, what's up? Why the long face? Are you depressed or something? Bro, imagine a stand where they sell subscriber lines. -Okay. -In front of a mall, in the open. I mean, only handing out sex shop leaflets in Sihhiye could be worse than that. I've never been disgraced like that in my life. A kid stopped by… What you said about sex shop leaflets in Sihhiye… They really do that? What? Adem, you don't feel ashamed of yourself, do you? Just now, as I entered the room you were counting your beads. Why did "sex shop" engaged your attention? It has nothing to do with that. You said it and it just caught my attention. I mean, what do I care? God! -Ömer? -What is it, man? I have breaking news for you, Ömer. Dear God! Never mind that, just go break yourself, man! I arranged a meeting on our book for this evening. -Tell me, what happened. -Some guy called me, Ömer. He read your book and enjoyed it. He wants to meet you tonight. What do you think? -Who's it? -I made some calls. They call him "the Messi of night life"! I think our luck will turn this time. What does he have to do with me? Am I a pop star? I don't know, man. But when a guy like him calls you, you better meet him. -Right, bro? -Yeah. What am I getting into? What kind of a trouble you're getting me into? Aren't you tired of getting into trouble already? I'm officially dragging you into the world of fame and money, Ömer. He said night life. That usually means trouble. -You think so? -Well… Shall I come with you? It'll be an adventure for me. Huh? Fine by me, man. He could be useful. Hey, Ali. Mom keeps asking about that 5 thousand. -What shall we do about it? -Ömer! Your mother will bathe in money. Don't worry about it. Come on, man. We need to get ready. Ömer, he really is an eye sore. Who is he? My friend from high school. Here he comes! Where does he get that much money? I see you're driving around again. Yeah, man. You know… Selim, the bear costume really suits you. I have money, so I drive around, man. If I didn't have money, I wouldn't. Right? You poor boy! Will you give us a ride? Hop in. Come on! You can't get on this car, you poor guy. He made a show of himself, he offended us and he drove off. -Well, I am kind of offended. -You know what? You get used to getting hurt. You even begin to enjoy it. Oh dear! Where are my socks? Hello, buddy. We are here to see the Messi of night life. He's waiting us. -Who should I say wants to see him? -Tell him the prince of poetry world wants to see him. Poet Ömer and Ali would be enough, sir. Hang on. Can't I introduce myself in any way I want? Why do you dwell on details? He doesn't know you, does he? How could he know whom the prince of poetry refer to? Ömer, guys like him are usually shady. I'm telling you. Adem, please stop creating tension. We'll go in and see what happens. You two can get in. Who's this guy? Are you talking to me? I am an ambassador, man. What's the problem? Couldn't you recognize me? He's a poet too. That was just a couple of lines from one of his poems. It's really difficult to understand these guys. Let's not keep Messi waiting. Will he come out or shall we go in? Come with me. Sometimes I get carried away. Keep me in line if need be. They'll beat us black and blue. What the hell are you doing? It was the year of 1996. Ercan gifted me this painting. The late Ercan was shot and killed. So, you must be the Messi of night life. You can call me Kurdal, dear Ömer. All right, Kurdal. I'll cut to the chase. I read your poetry book. Man! Such suffering, such drama, such flood of emotions. Especially that poem. "You'll get burned and you'll bleed" You're a blossoming rose, You're my presumptuous babe Exactly. I made them arrange music for it. Composition is ready too. You'll take the stage here. But I don't know how to sing. You wrote the lyrics. No one can do justice to it other than you. You'll take the stage and you'll sing the hell out of it. Give me a C! C! Again. C! I can't believe that C! You just enchanted me. It's done! Tomorrow night you'll be on stage. How come? With just hearing a C, how can you think I can sing? -Let me at least sing an E too. -And I'll pay you 15 thousand for tonight. I'm in! Mr. Kurdal, in addition to that 15 thousand… You know I am Omer's agent. I mean, I represent him. If it's all right… Not a problem, Ali. Just be here tomorrow night and get your payment. You're the man! Really! Who's this guy? I am a poet as well. But I'm a novice yet. I just tag along so that I can learn a few things from the master. Well, it was nice to meet you, guys. Levent, give him the song. He should study it tonight. Tomorrow he'll be on stage. This guy is a lion lover. Isn't it supposed to be just a lion? For us it is lion lover. Levent, show them. His boobs are really perky. Mine are a bit saggy. To hell with your boobs… Mr. Kurdal, then... Can we be excused? I mean, if you'll excuse us… -If you'll allow us... Will you? -See you. See you too, friends. Oh, Mom! My poor mom! You son is in deep water, Mom. Mate, you look very handsome. You think so? -I am dressed like a pimp thanks to you. -No, man! You look like a star performer. It's a fine stage costume. You shine brightly. You memorized the song, right? The intonation, the tone. All is well? Believe me, if you fail they'll beat us to death. I'm all right. You go on. Here comes a new talent. He's the king of blues. He's the poet of nights. Give it up for him! Mr. Poet, you are really something. Go on, sing, man. -Sing, man. -Shut up! We want to listen to him. -What the heck… -What the hell are you talking about? I'll kill you and your family. Officer, I was on stage, singing. Out of nowhere two guys begin to shoot. The gunfight took us aback. Chief, the guys risked their lives just like that... -I will cancel your life… -Shut up. Calm down! Calm down, guys. Tell me everything calmly. What happened to your face? During the gunfight, one of them blew the other's brain out. I swear, I felt a bullet going through between my lips. Here you… What is it? What? Moisturizer. -It'll be good for you. -Get out of here, man! -Just get the hell out. -Enough! Enough! Here, sign your statements. Don't make everything harder than it is for us. Here you go. Take the pen. Look at you and your clothes! Who are we having to deal with at this late hour? God! What a day! In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful. God damn you, man! I wanted to be a poet, man. I wanted to communicate my feelings. I was caught in a crossfire in a night club, man! A crossfire! Is that my fault, too? Was it I shooting up? I'm still in shock. Give me a break. Stay there. I hope you'll stay in shock forever. -Okay? -You offend me. You'll say sorry. I'll embarrass you. -Just wait. -Fuck off! I suffered the blows of misfortune Over and over again My heart was broken Repeatedly Ömer? -Ömer? -Yeah? Your friend is here. Ali. Ali? Why are you here? Why did you invite him in, Mom? Oh my! He said he's your friend. Will you invite anyone who calls himself my friend in my room? He violates my right to privacy. Mate, that really hurt. Whatever. Go in, son. Come on in. Behave well, all right? Behave well and play together. Sit down, man. Just on the edge of my bed. What's going on, man? Why did you knock my door like an unwanted ex lover? I had no other choice, man. Would you come if I invited you to meet? -Not really. -Well then, here I am. But I haven't come empty-handed. I have a friend. He's into electronic music. For a really long time now. I gave him the song Kurdal had it composed. He made a great song out of it. It'll sweep you off your feet. What the hell, man? Don't you clean your earbuds? Play it. What do you think? Well, I am not really into electronic music -but it sounds good. -Right, man! It rocks! You're on stage tonight, Ömer. What stage? Haven't you had enough already? I am a big man but I feel destroyed, man. Get off my back. I got Ramiz listen to this song. He loved it. He has an opening in the night club tonight. He invited you to take stage. Get a hold of yourself, man. Ömer? Can you come for a minute? Yes, Mom? Mom? Here you go, son. Enjoy it with your friend. You're an angel, Mom. You didn't need to. You were supposed to pay back my 5 thousand. Wow! In return for this fruit nappy? I'll repay you. Cross my heart. I will. Take my life if you need to! -Dear God! -Okay. Take it. He says "Take my life if you need to". That's his response. Put a collar on me Take me to a walk Wrap me up in cotton Breastfeed me Get me seated on a hairdresser's... How much do they offer? -600. -I'll take 200 of it. Too much. 100. -Deal! -Here you go. I'll only sing, right? Right, man. Be ready at 8 o'clock. We'll take the bus, right? Are you nervous, big boy? Nervous? Why should I be? Listen. I hope we won't face a problem here. Don't jinx it, man. Look at people having fun. Why would people get into a gunfight here, Ömer? Just entertain us. How should I stand on stage? Just be energetic, catch your audience and make them dance. Go on, big boy. Shut it down! Don't run away! Don't run away. IDs! What are you doing? Get the dope. Get in! Get in now! Your son is not innocent anymore, Mom! My dear mother! -Shut up. -Let go of me. Oh no! Not you again! He can't even stand straight. Sit him down there. -Riza father. -Riza father? Mesut? Husnu Coban? What did you take? We are close to the crime scene. We can get there. Get him to wash his face and get him in custody. Didn't you hear Riza father? Go on, take him in. You are my best friend. You know that don't you? What did I do to deserve this? Is this a way to treat someone? My mother is home waiting for me. If you don't let me go she'll bring the building down. May God help you, mate. Hey! -What the hell, man? -You are the cause of all my troubles. Look where we are! They handcuffed me, man! -See where we are! -Am I the culprit here? I am here too. It's not like you're in custody and I am in a lodge drinking my scotch. Get out of my sight! What the hell, man? It is a nice song and you sang it beautifully. You have a nice voice, man. All right, thanks. You're making me uncomfortable. Step back! Not a problem, man. Not a problem. Good God! Ali, come here. Look in front of you, man! Ömer? Where does the saz sound come from? Man, what are you doing? Do I play well, man? You really play well. -And you sang it very well. -Thanks. Hey, mate, do you have an agent? Ali, I thought we'd never see the light of the day. Life in prison sucks, man. It sucks. I swear my life flashed before my eyes. Ömer, don't blow it out of proportion. We were there for just a day. I was taken in custody when I was in high school. This was the second time. No way there'll be a third time. Mate! Okay. There won't! Go home. Mrs. Sukran must be waiting for you. I'm off. I didn't put you in prison, man! Isn't it nice? Thank God the course was canceled. You never ask me out to drink something. Oh my! It's Rahime. It's a nice venue. Yeah. It's my first time here. What is your horoscope? I am a Capricorn. What is yours? Wonderful. I really get along well with Capricorns. I am an Aquarius. -Do you think we get along well? -I don't know... Yeah, I think we do. Rahime? Sis! -What's going on? -Brother! Where did you come from? Prison! Miss Rahime, when I am rotting in jail I see you outside the borders of Kecioren. You are in Cukurambar, huh? Brother, what are you talking about? I am sorry, Hakan. My brother is a bit weird. Shut up! What do you mean by weird? Who are you, man? -I don't understand, man. -What's there not to understand? When I am in jail, are you taking advantage of my absence and making advances to my sister? Can you see the trails of prison bars on my face? They are the trails of suffering, injustice and nonchalance. That's enough, Brother! Are you taking us for a ride? What? No. Not at all. I have a couple of questions for you. Is my sister a girl to have fun with or a girl to get married to? What do you mean, man? Let me repeat the question. Is my sister a girl to get married to or a girl to have fun with? A girl to get married to. Visit us to ask for her hand in marriage tomorrow. Brother, God damn you! -You humiliate me! -Will you come tomorrow? -We will. -Will you come tomorrow? We will. Nope! I don't approve your marriage. I intimidated you and you agreed to marry her. That means I can intimate you to leave her. This is not right! Go on, leave. -Brother, come on! -Get up. -Brother, come on! -Take your wallet. Get up. Rahime, take care. Bye. Brother, what the hell? He is just a friend. -What do you think you're doing? -Rahime, believe me, getting into jail really affected me. I can't help but eat the head off people. I can't control myself. Why are you looking at me? Did you say that to me? Would I ever? You're a stud! Rahime, get up. You big stud! Come on, Rahime! You sweet love bug! Come on, Rahime. They'll screw me up! Can't I have my space? No. Not without me in that space. Okay? It was no big deal. We were just drinking tea. Drink shit! You didn't ask my permission. -You make me tense. -I'm here to protect you. Mom! What happened? Why are you shouting in the middle of a street? Your son... This douchebag humiliated me. -You won't believe what he did. -What did he do? I was drinking tea with Hakan. We were having a chat. He came out of nowhere and kicked him out. He said nasty things to him. What nasty things? I tried to protect you. Am I not the pillar of this family? I don't want you as brother. And I don't want a pillar! How shall I face Hakan now, Mom? Don't face him. Don't face Hakan. Stay away from me! Please! Son! Son, I'm talking to you. Will you ever prove yourself to be useful? Even if just a bit. What did I do now? She's 25! A grown-up woman. Why would she need to ask your permission to see someone? Who do you think you are? You jerk! I told her she could go. What is it to you? Rahime! She's the apple of your eye. You never care for your sensitive son. I didn't come home last night. Did you even worry about me? I don't know. You can go anywhere you want. You're a big boy. What happened to your face? Never mind that. What are you doing here? Are you here to buy my book? Don't upset your mother, son. You keep upsetting her. Don't. Be kind to her. Come on! I just got out of prison, I don't want to hurt someone. Ömer, don't upset yourself. And don't upset your mother. I really need her. I have a lot of plans for her. If only you knew about them. Slimy Ali -What is it? -Ömer? I'm at the billiard saloon. Why don't you come here? I'm not coming anywhere. Please come, man. I have the sweetest job for you. Shove off! Hey, mate. Mate! My ass! What's the job this time? A usual one, man. Really a routine job. Go on, tell me. Which night club have you sold me to? No, man. Nothing like that. Tell me, what it is? What is it? Mate, there's conference organized by Respect Art Association. A few poets will recite their poems. They're looking for poets who'll recite their poems in Feshane. I already said okay. If you want me to, I can call them and cancel. -Will I be one of the poets? -Yeah. Really? You don't want to? It's my dream, man. Are you crazy? Don't cancel it. -When is it? -Tomorrow morning. Come and get me. Shall we go by bus together? Yeah, sure. Stage? Ambiance? -Go on. -Really? Adem, what do you think will become of Ömer? Nothing will become of him. He'll continue to stay in the third page. Smell of blood interrupts my loneliness The moon light questions my sister-in-law My teeth bite my flesh A dagger sticks in my skin I have shackles in my blind cell Stop mumbling Just cut off my head A bird perches on my pinkie Mus is the only place I want to settle Now we'll watch Strawberry Ice Cream's dance show. Mr. Ali, we thought he would recite children poems. Well, my friend's poem reflect his soul. I mean he just flows. Madam, you can't categorize poems. I just read my poem. Okay but these kids can't understand your poems. Besides, even I couldn't make any sense of it. Enough! So what if you couldn't? What the hell are you talking about? Go on, leave! Both of you. I won't! No way! Not before I watch the dance show of Strawberry Ice Cream. Security! -Security, could you please… -All right! We're leaving. Regards. You told me it was a conference organized by Respect Art Association. I thought so. I don't know, man. I think I heard them wrong on the phone. Stop lying to me! -Did we get paid? -Nope. It was to bring prestige. Oh my! Prestige, huh? Taking the stage before Strawberry Ice Cream class. You really make a major contribution to my career. Dear Ömer, the road to summit is laid with obstacles. Step by step. Be patient. Don't speak! Shut up, man! Keep it shut! I'm off! Oh my! He really thinks highly of himself. Oh, Mother! Oh my mother! I came empty handed today too. I squirm with embarrassment. I am one aimless loser. A funeral? Easy peasy. Piece of cake for you, man. You'll just recite your depressive poems, shout and wail for the deceased. We'll take our 200 before leaving. 50 of it is mine. I'll just make people cry, huh? Exactly. Come on. They're waiting for you. You're the man! Death took away the man of the house It was a she! She left us at a young age She was 87 years old. What? She had a long life. Oh, my Death took her away suddenly Death parted us apart Son, she was in coma for three months. Why didn't you tell me all that beforehand, Ma'am? I would lament accordingly. Hey, you're leaning on me like a crutch. Come on, straight yourself up. You wept for hours, man. You did stay in character. Wipe the buttermilk on your mouth, man. I almost lost one of my lungs upstairs, you are here -eating pita and drinking buttermilk. -What? I shouldn't eat? Here you go. I am leaving. I feel depressed anyway. Mr. Edip, I really feel ashamed to ask, but we are in a bind this month. I promise I'll pay you back at the soonest time possible. What kind of a talk is that, Sukran? I might be in a bind in the future. I know how hard it is to run a household all by yourself. If only you had someone to support you. Your children are really useless. Can we keep it quiet, please? You don't need to say that. This is just a beginning for us. It'll be our secret. You know what? I have a lot of plans with you. Oh my! Ömer is coming. Please become lost, will you please? He might go mental. Please go. Ömer? Son? What's the matter with you? Death is tough, Mom. In this mortal world it really makes no sense to hurt or upset people. My dear. My son! Darling! Have you realized it now? Will you work for Mr. Edip? Mom, did you listen to me? What are you talking about? Do you dwell on that? What do you mean? Dwell on what? I have only one son. Only one son. Isn't it my right to want to see him get married? Have children? I am trying to realize my dreams. Doesn't it satisfy you? What dreams? What? -I am a poet. -You are not! -I am a poet. -You are not! You wasted your youth by believing in that pipe dream. You wasted your youth. -Believe in me, just once. -Get out of here! Do whatever the hell you want to do. By the way, why are you in Edip's front garden? Get out of here! Edip, what the hell, man? It's just a decor, Ömer. Not okay? I am soaking wet thanks to you. Do you want to wring my underpants? Edip, I said that out of my anger. You really didn't need to. It's okay, Ömer. I am not a stranger. Here. It's done. What is it, Ömer? Why were you arguing with your mom? You know, we argued about my ambition to be a poet. She wants me to find a job. She tells me that poetry is a bubble. -We had a row again. -This is not okay, Ömer. Don't upset the poor woman. I mean your mother is an appreciative, angelical and decent woman. That's a shame. Don't make her sad, son. I told you a hundred times, Ömer. Find her a match and get her married. But you never listen to me. A widower who lost his wife untimely, a strong, honorable and trustworthy man who can support her financially someone with Grey hair... -Is that you? -I've been single for a long time now, -my dear, Ömer. -Edip? Screw you, man. You're looking me right in the eye and you're hitting on my mom! Ömer! Bite your tongue. What kind of a talk is that? The fact that what I just told you now is compatible with the situation your mother's in is just a happy coincidence, son. God, give me patience. Listen, Edip! You're old enough to be my father. See? You said it yourself. -You called me father. -No! That's not what I meant. I didn't call you father. I'm talking about something else. Stay away from my mother. You will stay away from my mother. I can't believe we're talking about this at the moment. I was thinking why you wringing my knickers. God! He tries to screw my mother on the sly. -Ömer? -Yes, Kubra? Oh! What happened to you? Are you all right? It's nothing. I was caught in the rain. I see. Well... I want to tell you something if you have a second. -When you were reciting a poem... -What poem? What poem? Look at my state! You're in the balcony day and night. Will you get in? I'm off. -But it was beautiful... -Yeah. Really beautiful. But... Will you listen to me just once, Ömer? Just once. Let me put it here. -Let me sit down. -Sit, man. Sit down. What's up with you, man, at this late hour? I was at Edip's. I got upset and stormed out. With the robe on me. -What were you doing at Edip's? -I was soaking wet. -God bless him, he wrung out. -What did he wring out? -My underpants. -What are you talking about? -What the hell? -Edip and I are lovers. What nonsense is that? You are the one talking nonsense. I got wet and he dried my clothes. I am at odds with mom. I can't go home. Why didn't you tell me that? You made me feel uneasy. Why do you feel uneasy? Let's say it is true. Would I sleep with Edip? You're making me talk nonsense now. My mom and I had a row. I can't go home. Can I stay here tonight? Of course you can. No problem. -About money and you being unemployed? -Yeah. -You know Salim, right? -Yeah. He is a neighborhood representative candidate. Here's his brochure. Maybe you can write a poem or something you know, to promote him and earn a few bucks. -2000 will do. -Get the fuck... -600? -Hey! -500? -Talk it out with Salim. I meant to ask you something. What's the deal with Kubra? I run into her wherever I go. -She saw me half naked on my way here. -She's smitten with you. -Smitten with me? -Yeah. Dear God! You should at least be ashamed of your beard. You're like a matchmaking service. You're making a face now. Matchmaker Adem. Get out of here. Listen, man. If my mom asks my whereabouts, tell her you haven't seen me. -Let her worry about me. -Got it. Give the robe to Edip. All right, mate. Bye. Idiot! -Ömer? -Hey, Kubra. What's up? Good. How are you? -I am fine. -What happened to your face? I slept on a chair. -It must have left a trace. -I see. Well... I need to tell you something. -I am leaving. -Leave then. -Why don't you go already? -Yeah, I'm leaving. All right. Go home quickly. Watch out for traffic. -I am leaving. -Go on then. Nobody's holding you here. Go on! Hey, neighborhood residents! Are you hungry for services? You'll be full. You representative Salim will get worried when you are worried, When you're happy he'll be over the moon. What the hell is he saying? Get him down. Come here, man! Get him down! Mom? Ömer? Who did this to you? -Accident at work. -What? Accident at work? Come in. You have a guest. Make yourself presentable. -Come in. -Who has come? Is it Ali? Wow! Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan! Hello, Ömer. Brother. What bought you here? Your mother asked me to come. Here I am. I heard you published a book of poetry. Right. I did. How does my mother know you? Son, Ahmet is an old friend of mine. Before your dad. What do you mean by before my dad? I browsed through your book. What do you think? It's good, huh? I hope you didn't cry. Your mom told me about you. She said since childhood you've been after your dreams. Beyond any doubt, it's good to chase your dreams. But dreams do not necessarily come true. If you want let me read one of my poems for the sake of example. My elders used to say study and learn, Grow into a man But before I could read them They took away all my books They destroyed my hopes one by one That's why I always have tearful eyes That's why I am always beetle browed That's why I always make fists If I couldn't grow into a man Let those who call themselves "a man" Blush with shame Let those who call themselves "a man" blush with shame. You mean it's impossible. Nothing is impossible, Ömer. But... Unlikely. Right. I got the message. That's all, man. Poet Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan came to our house. He's a friend of my mother. He explained it in detail. He is indeed right. Whatever we did nothing worked. Right? -Nothing. -Right? Didn't work. If it doesn't work, it simply doesn't. It wasn't meant to be. Bottom line is, my dreams of being a poet... came to an end. Where does your mother know Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan? -They're from the same village. -Which village is that? -Kizilcahamam. -Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan is from Adana, man. You idle man, how do you know that Ahmet Selcuk Ilkan is from Adana? Or why for that matter? God! It doesn't interest you, man. I read his biography. His grandfather's second wife was from Kizilcahamam. Did you read that too? -No. -Why are you still talking then? I am overwhelmed here. All right! Don't fall out with each other. Ömer, just know that I am there for you whatever you decide to do. Can I be honest too? -You can. -Good decision. Well done, man. Thanks a lot! I really needed your approval very much so. He's your friend from high school, huh? Right. -Hello? -Hello, sir. I wanted to speak with Ömer. Who's asking? I am Atakan from Canocan Production Company. I wanted to talk to you for a role in the film we're working on. Yeah, speaking. We have a video of you reciting a poem on stage. -We really liked you. -Who's that? What does he say? He's talking about a video. Me reciting a poem... Right! I sent it. I am his agent. Let's do it like this. If you give us your address we could come by all in good time. Let's hold a meeting, Atakan, sir. Very pleased to hear it. See you tomorrow. Good talking to you, too. Thank you. Thanks. -What time shall we go? -What do you care? -I am your agent. -What do you care? -I'll take a 100 out of your fee. -You can take shit. Shame on you. Ömer? Now you'll see how I market you. I'll knock you dead. Yeah, you marketed me really well! Why are you putting on airs now? -Respect my efforts. I broke a sweat. -Mr. Ömer? Hello. We talked on the phone yesterday. Hello, Atakan. Mr. Cem is the owner of our production company. -Ms. Seyda is our casting director. -Hello. Hello! I don't like to beat around the bush. I grew up with German culture. You know, things go... Chop chop! -Yeah, it's like that. -Chop chop! That means Mr. Cem is a bit impetuous. And he has every reason to be. Now, we watched your video. One of the characters in our film is a poet and you're a perfect match for the role. Cem, how much do you plan to pay? 20 thousand Liras. Can we sign a contract and get our money today? Why not? Why not? After you sign the contract you can collect your money from the accounting department downstairs. He is really "chop chop". Good luck with it. You are a sweet man. I didn't have a chance to watch that video. Can I watch it please? Sure. Just a minute. I have shackles in my blind cell Stop mumbling I recited it well. A bird perches on my pinkie Mus is the only place I want to settle You watched Ömer Basdogan's poetry recitation. Oh my! That's Kubra. Yes. Miss Kubra. She sent me the video. She's my sister's friend. -When you were reciting a poem... -What poem? -The outfit really suits you. -Thanks. Ömer, did you publish a book? -Why are you here? -I wanted to support you. -She's smitten with you. -Smitten with me? -I am leaving. -All right. I am leaving. See you in the shootings. Kubra? Ömer? -What is it, son? -Where is Kubra, auntie? She's on her way to Istanbul. She is accepted for a job there. She'll move there. She left a few minutes ago. -How will she go? -By bus. -Thank you. -All right. -Can't you see her? -No, man. She left, man. She left just like that. Sometimes no matter what you do, it just doesn't happen, man. -Don't worry. -We take some things for granted until we lose them. -A cliche. -Don't be upset, Ömer. After all, we came here to look for her. I know that feeling very well. Is there anything you know well, man? What do you know? You don't even let me suffer. -Ömer? -Her voice still rings in my ears. Good God! I swear! Her voice echoes in the sky. Are you all right, Ömer? Ömer? Whoa! Kubra! -What are you doing here, Ömer? -I came to look for you. -Why? -Kubra! I was so unfair to you. I kept ignoring you. You always wanted the best for me. But I acted like a dick. They really liked the video you sent. They even offered me a role. -Yeah. -Really? They paid me a large sum. This is your share. No! No way. -Please. -No, I can't accept it. -Pretty please. -No. No. -Okay. -No. I am really happy you got the role and got paid. No need to apologize. You are such an angel. How the hell did I take you for granted? -Are you really leaving? -Yeah, I am. What if I ask you to stay... I can't stay here. I'm chasing my dreams. Just like you. You have every right to do so. Let's hug one last time. You never know. I can come. What do you think? Sure. Let's hug. Ömer? Ömer? Ömer? Ömer? Give me a second, Kubra. What? What is it? We ran, we had fun, finally you're united. Can I have my commission, man? -Ten percent of it makes 2 thousand. -Yeah, you deserved it. -What do you prefer? -Cash, man. Cash, huh? Love. Love.
