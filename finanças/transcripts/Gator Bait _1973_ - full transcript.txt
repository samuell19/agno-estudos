(slow banjo music) (melancholy Cajun music) (upbeat Cajun music) * Desiree * You're a true, sweet Cajun * Come to me, my belle of light * * I want you, I need you to be mine * * And I'll wait for you inside this house * - [Ben] Let's go, she ain't comin'. - She'll be here. Found her snares yesterday. Want the prize? - Yeah, it's cold out here, Billy. - Do it before it's too late. If you look back to much, you'll be heading in the wrong direction. (laughs) - I'm going home, she ain't comin'. Let's go. - She'll be here. (singing in foreign language) - [Ben] I'm going home. She ain't worth freezin' for. - Come on, Ben, stay huh. She's worth it. - Let me drive? - What? - Let me drive the boat. - You'll wait with me? - Let me drive. - Okay, you got a deal. * Oh pretty Cajun * Tell me that you love me * Let me build you a small shack in Sacrist Bay * * And I'll never let you stray from me * (singing in foreign language) (Billy shushing) (motor humming) There she is. Oh, that is some piece, ain't it? I told you she'd be worth waiting for. Look at that. - How we gonna get her to lay down out here and screw us in all this swamp? - She ain't got no choice. She either screws us or she gets behind bars. Putting a wildcat like that behind bars is bad. - Yeah, Leroy tried to get him a piece of her and you know what she did? She cut his balls off. - That's 'cause your brother's stupid. We ain't stupid. (laughs) (gator hissing) We got her now. Hey coon there! We caught ya! We done caught ya, red handed! (motor starting) (Billy laughing) Come on, start that boat. - [Ben] Whoa, watch out. - Woo! Go damn, hey don't kill me. (Billy laughing) (lively music) Go faster. Don't lose her. Don't lose her at the bend. She's over there. Woo-hoo. Hey, to the right, to the right. Woo-hoo! Come on, get her. Come on, Ben, give her that! Hey, watch out, you're gonna drown me! Hey cooner! Hey, Desiree. Pull over in the name of the law and drop your britches. Closer, closer and I'll grab me a piece of that right now. Woo! Desiree, wanna fornicate? - [Ben] What's that, Billy? - [Billy] I don't know, but sounds good. We caught ya poaching that gator, Cajun. You got a choice, either jail or us. Woo! Hey poontang, we gonna give you a free ride. Hey, hey! Hey Cajun! Come on, Ben. Watch, Ben, Watch that tree! You gonna smack my daddy's boat and kill me! Come on, woo! Turn to blind slew, Ben. We got her now. We got her trapped now, Ben, woo-hoo! Hey, cooner, we caught ya. We caught ya poaching. - Yeehaw! - [Billy] God! Ah, snakes! Oh, I hate snakes! (gunshot firing) Oh, snakes! (gunshots firing) - Do something, Billy, do something! - I am doing something! (gunshots firing) Ben! Pa! Pa! It's murder, Pa. Murder, just plain murder. Them, them them snakes jumping around my. - What are you talking about, Billy Boy? - Oh, it's. That Cajun wildcat, Pa, she did it. She killed Ben Bracken. - Ben Bracken, are you sure? - Sure I'm sure, Pa. Me and Ben, we was riding around in your new boat just like you told me. Just riding around looking around, and we caught her poaching gators. - Damn it, Billy Boy, how many times have I told you to leave that Cajun alone! Her daddy and her daddy's daddy has been hunting these gators in these swamps for 100 years, and me or no new fangle law's gonna change that! Now it's murder. I've got to go in and drag that wildcat out and on the only way you get those swamp rats out is dead! - [Billy] I'm sorry, Pa, me and Ben didn't mean nothing. - Well you tell that to them there Brackens. There's gonna be hell to pay. Did you bring young Ben's body out? - No, Pa, I couldn't. She blowed his head clean off. Besides, she sunk your boat. - Holy Jesus, she sunk my boat, too? I just paid $3000 for that boat! Oh God, wait'll I get my hands on that girl. Why she's ornerier than her old man. Come on, let's go tell them Bracken's. Best to get this thing over with. Somebody's gonna get killed. - You reckon we better get some more men to back us up, Pa? - Hell no, she's only one girl. Best to keep this thing quiet. No use upsetting everybody. - What you reckon them Bracken's gonna do, Pa? - I don't know. TJ's a mean old bastard and Pete and Leroy I think are just sick in the head. (calming Cajun music) (man spitting) - Lauralee. - [Lauralee] Yeah? - Where's Leroy? - I don't know. (lively Cajun music) - [Pete] You sure look fine sliding around in that thing. - Feels good, too. Stop this, store bought. - Why don't you give me a little? (Lauralee screams) (Lauralee screams) (whip cracking) (Pete screams) - Pete Bracken, I oughta kill ya, ya horny bastard. (Lauralee panting) That there's your sister! The hell you trying to do? Get her knocked up with some dimwit kid, turn out like you, huh?

(Leroy spits) You better come up the house quick, the Sheriff and son's coming. Shit. - Lauralee. - Yeah, Pa? - Get yourself dressed and get some supper on the table, we got company, you hear? - Okay, Pa. - Git! - I'll do all the talking, you hear, Billy Boy? Come on. (Leroy spitting) - Howdy, Sheriff, Billy Boy. - TJ. - What y'all doing round these parts? Ya hunting for somebody? - Well, you might say that, TJ. Me and Billy Boy are going in the swamps and bring out the Thibodeau girl. - By yourself? Man, you're gonna have your hands full. That swamp ain't no place for nobody to go in by himself. Ain't nobody even knows where them Thibodeau's live, 'cept me, and I ain't for sure. So long since I been there. Must be something mighty bad make you wanna go all the back there for some gal. I admit she's pretty as her ma, but man, coon ass comes a whole lot easier than that. (laughs) Something bad all right. Y'all stay for supper. - Sure, TJ. Now TJ, I'm afraid I got some bad news, for ya. It's young Ben, he's dead. (somber music) I'm sorry, TJ. - Oh no, not Ben. That's my baby. Damn! Who did it? - Easy, TJ. It was Desiree Thibodeau. Billy Boy and Ben caught her poaching them gators and silly fools tried to stop her. - She shot Ben. And she sank Pa's boat, too. - Now you see there, Sheriff, she done it this time. There's me, now Ben. - [TJ] Where is he? - He's in the swamps, Mr Bracken. I tried, I tried to find him. I looked all over for him. Hell, I couldn't find him. - Well you go look again. We're gonna look again and again and again. Don't leave my boy for no gators. (sullen music) - Hell, ain't no use lookin' round here no more. - Done been through here, twice. I believe Billy Boy's right. Damn swamp does got him. - [Billy] Yeah, swamp's got him, Mr Bracken. I looked, I looked real good. I been all over here. - Didn't look good enough, boy. We're gonna find him. - Mr Bracken, I been through all these swamps here before. - [TJ] Why didn't you put her away when I told you to, Sheriff? - [Sheriff] Hell, TJ, why she done have to be put away for something other than poaching these gators. Can't put her away for something like that. - [TJ] None of that family any good. Gal's a bitch just like her ma was. How bout what she did to Leroy, aye? - [Sheriff] Now hold on, TJ, that was Leroy's doing. He was told to stay away from that gal. Shit, a plain case of rape as far as I'm concerned, her being a youngin' and all. Besides, I'd had to put him in jail, too, if it'd come to court and I told you so. - [Billy] Ain't nothing here, Mr Bracken. - [TJ] We gotta keep lookin'. - [Sheriff] Damn TJ, we been all over these parts have a dozen times now. - Why don't we try over there? - Ben! Ah, Ben! Ben. Ben. - [Leroy] Pa! - Oh God. (crying) - I'm sorry, TJ. - Sorry? I'm going in after that God damn, coon ass bitch. (tense music) - We'll all go in after her. After all, I'm still law here bouts, TJ. - Bullshit. Oh Ben. - [Billy] It was Desiree, Mr Bracken, it was her. I bet she's out there with that brother and sister of hers right now, laughin' at us. (motor humming) (motor humming) - Desiree. Careful. - How you be? - You didn't do well, no? - No good. Almost got caught today. Ben Bracken and Sheriff's boy. Here. From now on we track different swamps. New places now. Come on. Tomorrow we catch armadillo, no? - Ain't no one knows for sure where they are 'cept the coonies. They don't talk to nobody. - [Pete] I wonder if she's got a man out there? - Don't you ever think of nothing else. - Ooh. - [Pete] What the hell you laughing about? You can't do nothing but think about it. - Shut your mouth, pecker head. Make you want me to shut it for ya. - Leroy, Pete, get your asses in the boat!

Let's go see if we can find out from these coonies where that gal moved. - [Leroy] They ain't gonna tell ya nothing, Pa. - [TJ] Well hell, it won't hurt to ask. (tense music) Pete, Billy Boy, y'all stay with the boats. - [Billy] Hell, Pete can handle it. I always get left outta the action.

Might as well bed down for the night. No use lookin' for that coonie in the dark. - [Pete] Hey Pa? - [TJ] Yeah? - [Pete] You reckon we're ever gonna find that place? - [TJ] We're gonna find it. Just keep looking, it's round here somewhere. - [Julie] How long you be? - Two, maybe three day. This time I go deep into swamp. Maybe I get better luck. No, you stay here with your sister. You take care of Julie now, huh? You be a good boy. - Good luck to you. We'll get some wood. (birds chirping) - [TJ] Where you going, Pete? - [Pete] I'm just gonna go take a crap, Pa. - [TJ] No, you stay here before you get yourself lost in swamps, ya here? - [Pete] I ain't gonna get lost. I growed up in these swamps. - [TJ] You do what I tell ya. I don't want the same thing happen to you that happened to Ben. - [Pete] All right, Pa. (Julie humming) Pa, Pa! Pa! (Julie humming) Pa, that's it, that's it right there. - [TJ] That's it, all right. Bet that bitch is inside. - Ooh-wee, I told you she was pretty.

He got no tongue! - Let him go, Leroy. We'll wait. She'll be back. - I been waiting for something like you for a long time, little girl. (Julie whimpering) - Pete, get your ass down to the boat. - Oh now, Pa? - You get in and make some supper. Leroy, go in and watch her. Get in there. - Now, Pa? - Right now! Go on, you coon ass, get in there. - Come on, Billy Boy. - [Sheriff] Go on with him, Billy Boy. - Hurry up, Billy Boy. - I'm hurrying. Boy, I tell you what? Pa ain't gonna keep me from getting to that little girl. I been waiting a long time for something as pretty as that. - Yeah, well mind if I get to her first. - First? Now look, I found her first, so I'm going first. - All right, I'll take second. (Leroy spitting) (knife slamming) (Julie whimpering) - [Leroy] You sure are a pretty little thing. Yeah. (Julie crying) - No, no you don't, you little bastard. Get back here. (Julie crying) I want you to keep a tight reign on them boys. I don't want no accidents to happen down here. - Yeah, we know all about accidents, don't we, Sheriff? - That's not the point. - Let's go. Come on, Joe Bob, bring the boy and let's look around, see if we can find a sign of that bitch. (Julie screaming) - Don't ever do that again. (Julie screaming) (Leroy shushing) Now, now you gonna tell me where that bitch sister of yours is, huh? (Julie crying) You gonna tell me where that bitch sister of yours is? Now you tell me. You tell me and I won't hurt you at all. (Leroy shushing) Now don't make a sound. Gonna tell me where that sister of yours is, huh? - Hey, big brother. What you up to? How'd you get her in such a huff? (boys laughing) - Where you going, little coonie, huh? Where you goin'? (Julie screaming) Huh, come here. - Yeah, Pete. (Julie screaming) Woo! Whoa, whoa whoa. A wildcat, Pete. Go in, yeah. (Julie screaming) (Julie crying) - Gonna stop 'em, TJ? - Ain't no business of mine. Boys will be boys. Besides, ain't gonna do nothing she wouldn't want them to do. - Say, get it, boy. Wanna get yourself killed? She's gonna be all right. Ah, damn! - [TJ] Got ya! (whip snapping) (tense music) Get outta here boy, before you get yourself killed. Weren't no use keeping the boy. Besides, he'll bring that sister of his back. (intense music) - [Billy] Whoa, whoa, oh you're a wildcat, aren't ya? Kiss a guy, come on. (Julie screaming) - Come on, Billy Boy. - I got her. - Hey, save some for me, ya hear. - There'll be plenty enough for everybody. Hey Leroy, would you hold this for me? - She wiggle like a wildcat. - Come on over here. I'll show you how a man does it. (Pete screaming) (gunshot firing) (Julie coughing) - That man enough for ya? - This ain't right, TJ. It's against the law and you know damn well it is. That girl ain't done nothing to nobody. - You saw what she did. God damn it, you saw what she did to Leroy and Ben! Now it's our turn. - Pa. Sick. Leroy's gone crazy, he's sick, Pa. He killed her. - Damn it, I told ya it wasn't right. I don't wanna get messed up in a bunch of crap like this! - What do you expect, Sheriff? Just be as easy as taking my money all these years to keep your head turned, so's nobody know about all them gators we been poaching. - Poaching and killing's two different things. - Ain't much different killing gators, killing coonies. Just a little mess here, that's all. Why don't you just keep your head turned, Sheriff, and pretend like you ain't here? You're good at that. - That's what's wrong now, damn it. I kept my head turned too long! (water splashing) - What's wrong, Big T? I told you to stay home with Julie, no? She's hurt? Oh God, bad? Come on, we go. (lively Cajun music) - [Billy] I'm scared, Pa. You ever been scared? - [Sheriff] You're damn right I've been scared. Son, I'm scared now. - I shoulda told you the truth. - Truth? What are you talking about? - It was a lie. She didn't kill Ben Bracken, Pa, I did. I shot him. - Well you lyin' little fool. What in the hell happened? - It was an accident. She dumped them snakes in the boat. I went back to pick up Ben. Was one more snake left in the boat and I picked up my gun and I shot it. But just as I shot it through the head, Pa, Ben was climbing in the back of the boat and he got it. Right in the head, Pa. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to touch nothing. I just left him sinking with the boat, I. - God's sake. Now's a fine time to tell me. TJ Bracken will kill you for sure if he finds out. - [TJ] Finds out what, Joe Bob? - Oh it's, Billy Boy, TJ. I think the swamps has got the best of him. He'll be okay. (people chattering) Look TJ, we're gonna have to start back tomorrow. - [TJ] Where you gonna go? Nowhere. (man yawning) - [Pete] She ain't coming tonight. - [TJ] She'll be back. - [Leroy] I can't wait to get my hands on that gal. I guarantee you one thing, when I get her she'll pay. - [Billy] You better watch out Leroy. You know she cut your balls off last time you tagged her. (Billy laughing) - [Leroy] Shut up your mouth. Sissy shit. (lively Cajun music) (boat exploding) - [Pete] What was that? (people yelling) (gunshots firing) - [Sheriff] Let's get down to that boat. (people chattering) - [TJ] It's been dragged out to the water. (people chattering) - Get away from us. - Over here, Joe Bob. (dramatic music) (Desiree screaming) - [Leroy] Holy shit, what was that? - [Sheriff] Found her sister. - [TJ] Quick, get to the cabin! Leroy, get a torch and burn that shack down. - [Pete] There she goes! Pa, there she goes! - [TJ] We don't want to leave no evidence behind, do we, Sheriff? - [Sheriff] TJ, give up. Give it up, damn it! - [TJ] Will you get off my back? I ain't leavin' this swamp till I get her. Yeah, she might even follow us. - [Sheriff] More than likely, TJ. She'll find us. You know how these Cajuns are. They're a close family. - [Billy] Ooh-wee! Move it out, boys! (birds chirping) - Oh, she been through here, Pa. Looks like she wants us to find her. (motor starting) Over there. Here's another one. Aw, just like a road map. We got her now, Pa. - Let's turn back, TJ. She's making it too easy. Gal's too damn smart to be making stupid mistakes like this for no reason. She's got something up her sleave. - You can get out any time you want, Joe Bob. But I'm gonna get that gal. - Pa. Pa, look right over there. - Yeah. She's as pretty as her ma. - [Pete] She sure is. - [Leroy] What's the matter with that gal? Showing us up like that. Don't she know we can see her? - She knows. - Boy, I can't wait to get my hands on that girl. - What are we waiting for? Ain't gonna be sitting here on our asses all day. Let's get going. (motor starting) (lively Cajun music) (gunshot firing) - [Leroy] Come on, Pa, get it moving, let's go. - [TJ] Get it moving? Hell, I'm bogged down. - [Pete] No way. - [TJ] Oh we're gonna fix that right now. Billy Boy, get out. Get out. - Get out where? Take it easy with that gun, Mr Bracken, I'm going. Shit! - You're next, son. - You're crazy, TJ. - Yeah, I may be crazy, get in the water! Leroy, next. - Shut up! - Leroy, get in that water. Take the boat, Pete. Let's go after her and get her. - Yeehaw! (intense music) - Shit. - Reckon that droopy old bastard's gonna leave us out here? - No, he ain't gonna leave us out here. No with his son, Leroy. He'll come back for that. - We gonna lose her. Come on, boy, get a move on. Kick the tar outta that motor. Faster. Come on now, boy. Damn it, why ain't you pushing hard? - Oh, we got her now, Pa, we got her. - [TJ] She ain't going nowhere now, Pete. - We got you, coonie. - That's for sure. (gun cocking) - What the hell's she doing? (gunshot firing) (wood cracking) God dang. - Get outta here! (gunshot firing) Hey, look at that wildcat go. She gonna kill herself. - [Desiree] Yeehaw! - Man. Tell ya one thing, boy, good ol' pappy sure give the kid a lot of guts. - Wasn't all he gave her either, Pa. - Hell, he's probably got her by now. You heard that shot a little while ago, didn't ya? - Like hell they did! Here she comes now! (motor humming) - She's gonna kill us! Here she comes! Pa! (Billy screaming) (gunshots firing) She's gonna kill me! (Leroy screaming) - Bitch! - You! - I'm gonna get you! Damn! - Y'all see the way she drove that boat today? She's some wildcat. I'd like to get me a gob of that. - When that sun goes down it chills off. - Yeah, it was cold out there today. Toss me one of them cups, will ya please? - Look TJ, we're gonna have to head back tomorrow. We're damn near outta grub. - We'll just have to go huntin', Joe Bob. - [Leroy] I hear something about using Desiree for gator bait? - Old man used tie a rope around little Desiree's waist and throw her in the bayou, and then when them gators come real close, stopping at her heels, he'd shoot 'em in the head. Some say he did that once with her ma. Remember, Sheriff? - Yeah, I remember. That old bastard. - I bet Desiree remembers, too. - Remembers what, Pa? - Nothing, Billy Boy. - Come on, Pa, remembers what? Come on, Pa, tell me. - Go on, Joe Bob, tell him. You're a fine, law abiding citizen. Go on, tell him. Tell him how you screwed around with Desiree's ma. How old man, Matthew Thibodeau caught y'all. Ran you out, used her for gator bait and you shot him. - It was an accident, TJ. You know that. - Bullshit. It was murder. And Desiree just stood there watchin'. - No wonder you wanted me to keep away from that gal all these years. You afraid she's gonna tell somebody something? - Yeah, he's afraid she'll tell somebody all right. Maybe that there judge would like to hear all about that little accident. - Shut up, TJ! Now you listen to me, and you listen real good. You've held this shit over my head for 12 years. That's all over. By God, I'm still the law here. And when I get out of this mess, things are damn sure gonna be different. Is that clear? - If you get out. - I never wanted a woman so much in my whole life. (man snoring) (boy spitting) (man snorting) - She stole our food, water. She coulda cut our throats. - TJ, if we do catch this girl, I'm not gonna sit by and let you kill her, you hear? - I hear ya, Sheriff. - Yeah, Pa. Besides, Pete wouldn't like that too well. - Pete wouldn't like it? - He wants to marry that girl. (TJ laughs) - He what? - He wants that girl real bad. - No Bracken kin of mine gonna marry no half-breed Cajun ya hear? Pete! Pete Bracken! Get your ass over here. - He can't hear ya, Pa. He went after her early this mornin'. - Well why in the hell didn't you stop him? - I told ya, he wanted that woman real bad. - Well you know she'll kill him. I oughta whip your ass good, boy. - You won't though, 'cause I ain't ever gonna let you whip me again. - Come on, let's go. He ain't that far ahead of us, we'll find him. (light Cajun music) (Desiree whistles) (lively Cajun music) (Pete grunting) - Here I be. You killed my sister, Julie. It won't be easy for you. Swamp take care of you. - [Leroy] It's Pete's hat. - [Sheriff] That don't look good at all. Can't be too far from here. - Looks like he went up that way. - Hey, what's that? Over there. (gunshot firing) Don't touch him! Don't touch him. Don't nobody touch him! God. (TJ yelling) Why Pete, why? Why don't you listen to me? I told ya not to go off on your own. Everybody said you was touched. I, I loved you just the same. I'm gonna kill her, Sheriff. And all her Cajun kin folk. I promise ya. - Now hold on, TJ, that's not gonna help any. - We're gonna die in this swamp. - Shut up, Billy Boy. Ain't gonna die. We might get lost, but we ain't gonna die. - Yeah, ain't no coonie gonna get my ass lost in these swamps, I'll tell ya that. - Don't worry about it. I'm gonna mark us a trail. - I don't know. This is her swamp. To her it's a living thing, it feeds her. Why, she knows this like the back of her hands. You're right, TJ. She is leading us. - You sound like you're scared, Pa. - You ain't shittin', I'm scared. She's gonna kill our asses. That gals the hunter now, we're the hunted. (gunshots firing) (intense music) - Where in the hell is she? (gunshots firing) - [Sheriff] Make a run for it, TJ! She's gonna kill us all! We're sittin' ducks! Go, run! (men yelling) (gunshot firing) (Billy grunting) - Ah, she's having herself a time. - Where's Billy Boy? - He got himself shot. - Shot? Well you're a brave son of a bitch. Why didn't you help him? - You think I'm gonna get myself killed over helping him, you're crazy. - I'm going back after him. - He's probably dead. Sheriff, she's gonna get you, too. - Billy Boy! - She came back, Pa, to see if I was dead. She just looked at me and left. Easy boy, easy, we'll get you outta here. - [Leroy] Just waiting for us to come out. I told ya he was dead. - He ain't dead yet. Help me get him back to the boat. - [Leroy] Pa, we ain't gonna take him with us. He'll slow us down. - You think not? Pick him up. Pick him up! - Do like he says, boy. - Aint getting none of his blood on my coat. I'll tell you that right now. - I don't give a damn where you get it. Get that boy on your back! - You can put your gun away now, Sheriff. - Go on, TJ. I don't trust you behind my back. (owl hooting) (air leaking) (Sheriff coughing) (birds chirping) - Pa. Don't let me die in this swamp, Pa. - I won't boy. I'll get you out if I have to carry you myself, okay? - Shit, look what she's done this time. Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa, she done it again. She slit the boat. She's gonna kill us yet. - Tell ya, damn might to that. Well it's a long walk back. Leroy, give me a hand with Billy Boy. - Bullshit, I ain't carrying him another step. - You don't think I'm gonna leave him here, do ya? - He's as good as dead, Joe Bob. Never get outta this swamp alive carrying dead weight. - Uh-uh. Leroy, you pick that boy up or I'm gonna blow your head off. - Them's pretty harsh words, Sheriff. You know I can talk you all by myself. - Uh-uh. Just you try it. I'll put a hole through you bigger than the one Billy Boy put through Ben. - What's that you said? You told me Desiree killed Ben! - She didn't. Billy Boy shot him when he was trying to get in the boat. - Well why in the hell did you tell me? We could've saved Pete and that little gal! - It was either Pete or Billy Boy! - Now it's gonna be either you or me. (gun cocking) I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands. - Now wait. (TJ yelling) (men fighting) (air bubbles gurgling) - Ah! - [Billy] Where's my Pa? Aye. Aye! Hey, where you going? Hey, take me, please. - [TJ] Let's get on home, Leroy. Ain't ya tired of killin'? - [Leroy] Not until I get her. She ain't never gonna let us get outta her alive unless we get her first. - Where's my Pa? Where's my Pa? (Billy crying) (gator hissing) - [Leroy] Tell ya we lost her, Pa. She ain't around here. - [TJ] Ain't lost her for long. Just keep lookin'. Keep a sharp look out, son.
