- Not sleeping? - I can't. I was drawing up lists, hoping I would get sleep. We need a table outside. And we need... a clothes dryer, plus the machine. - Yes. And... under the staircase, downstairs... we need to fix shelves. You know what else we need? A bed without a hole. They're not sleeping. Yes, they are. That's Léo. Mummy... Come on, go to sleep, honey. Not sleeping? - Yes, I am. - Yeah. Okay, sleep, now, my love. We'll make up when we're in our home. - Wow, it's huge! - Wait for us! - What's that? - The garage. - Shall we race? Go. - The first to the house! Move. I'm going first. So? - Put me down. - I'm carrying the bride! - Wait on! - Let's hold hands. - Let's go. - Daddy! - Faster! - Slowly. Be careful, are you ready? Look. Isn't it nice? - Where's my room? - Upstairs, next to Léo's. - And yours? - Over there. - The kitchen. The sitting room. - The table, the sofa... - We won't go to Paris again? - Of course we will. It's not far. - What progress they've made. - It's different. - Come here, you! - Don't be running all over. - Where'll the table soccer go? - What table soccer? - You promised! Can we go up? - No, next time. - Where'll the chimney be? - Careful, it's dangerous. - There. For Santa. - When will we have the dog? - When the house will be done. - Awesome! - So, don't we have a nice home? - Yep! We must choose the colours for the kitchen. - What's that for? - For the cement. - What's cement? - I'll show you! And see there, the TV. Imagine? Can you see it or not? - Where'll your piano go? - There's no hurry. Hey, take it easy. The house, the piano... Don't exaggerate. - I know that smile. - What? - Tell her! - "Tell her" what? Don't tell me... What have you been up to again? No choice. It's the house and the piano. - Don't worry, mummy. - What? Okay? Alright? Anyways, we just paid a tiny bit. - Can we sleep here, tonight? - Oh, yeah! No way. Sleep where? Where's your coat? - Open, you idiot! - Talk nicely to your brother. Tell him to open! Put your T- shirts for washing. - I've not finished. - That's enough! Stop it, both of you. Tom, come out of the bathroom. I've had enough. - It's for the headmistress? - No, I'm informing the landlord. The headmistress knows you're leaving? - Yes, but she asked for a letter. - I'll do it tomorrow. Tom, Tom... - Where are we going now? - To school. Is your schoolbag washing its teeth? Oh gosh! My schoolbag! Excuse-me. You inquired about the beds? They're the last. If you want them, you must pay a deposit. Oh, okay. Where must I go? - Right down. - Thank you. Where can I get table soccers? Hang on a sec. We don't have those. My love. I was going to call you. I had to take the beds. And we'll get the sofa in 8 weeks. What's wrong? What? I'm coming. Coming. I'm coming right away. Madam? Will you settle the balance upon delivery? Yes. I don't get it. They wanted you in their bank. I thought they needed you, they had faith in you... Looks like they don't anymore. I don't get it. How can they fire you when we've just signed a loan? That has nothing to do. It's not the same guys. They're not there. They don't care about the loan. It's not their problem, it's ours. - Something happened? - Not at all, nothing happened. When you come last, you're the first to go. I only had a week left on trial. They owe me nothing. Who was that guy you worked with at Crédit Lyonnais? You told him? He'll surely take you back. No way. What will I tell him? What's this for? For the kitchen? Juliette, we've got the loan for the house, for the car, the rent... and all the rest. You know how much I'll get on the dole? It won't pay the rent, Juliette. Where will we go? What about the house? It means... It means... we won't think about a third kid right now. Professional experience - What's that? - My life. I hope you're ready. - Get going. - Go and put your coat on. Here, there's mail. - Charlie? - Yes? There, it's for you. Call me soon after, huh? Let's go. Hey... I don't want you to have doubts. Don't question yourself. Wait on. Let's do it together. One, two, three. Very good. I'll be back. What news? That's all? That's all they told you? And the guy you knew. Was he there? I'll be back late. I've got 2 more classes. Love you. See you later. - A problem? - Not at all. - You okay? - Yes. Louise, get ready? Did you find someone to replace you? Not yet. But don't worry, we'll find someone. - Thanks. - You're leaving Paris. For you, your children... It will be a new life. Yes, we're happy... very, very happy. You too can buy a house! Hello, you've reached Juliette's voicemail. What are you doing? Calling my mobile. I'm calling that bastard. Stop it. Don't think about it anymore. Come. Come on, now. Alright. I'm ready. Okay, hurry up. Léo, get going. Get ready. Magic tricks Come on, off we go. Mummy, you're picking us up this evening? If I'm not there, wait for me. I've got a class at 3:30. - Where's it? - In the yellow one. Why do you win all the time? Go and wash your hands, my love. - Come on guys, let's go. - I'm ready. Where's my mobile? Go to the cops this morning. You threw away the plans? What to do with it? Look at me. To hell with the house, okay? To hell with the bank and all. I don't know what that guy could've done to you. - Daddy, we're ready! - Coming! - We'll be down. - See you later. Look at this, you've forgotten your bag again. You scatterbrain. Hello? I called you to block my credit card and cheque book. Your account number? I don't know it. Charles and Juliette Lesage. Excuse-me... - Do you remember me? - I've got a meeting. We need more time. - Go to the litigations. - How could I pay up in a week? I'm sorry. Nobody told you to have dreams beyond your means. Hello. You okay? Léo told me that... his daddy had lost his job. You're still going to move? Listen, I don't know. Tell me quickly. I'm getting lots of requests for the new term. What do we do? Shall I keep their place? Did you call Hugo's parents about paying the camp? - It's nearly full. - I'll do it. - Hello. - Hello. Who's that? My husband didn't call you? He did, but the visits for the week were planned. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Go in. Sorry, it's a mess. I didn't know. If you wanted to stay, you should have told us earlier. We couldn't cash the rent; it bounced back twice. It bounced back twice. Hello? Yes, speaking. You've found it? And my bag? Mrs Lesage. We won't be long. Tell them we're coming. Sorry, but the identification had to be tonight. If you don't recognise him, we have to let him go. We'll be face to face? There'll be a glass. He won't see you. We'll show you some men. If you see your attacker, let us know. I don't think we'll find your bag. It's usually drug addicts who do bag-snatching. He has no record for drugs. Guess he needed money. He's coming out of prison. Stand behind this glass. Take all the time you need. You can talk to me; he can't hear you. No. He's not there. - You've never seen any of them? - Never. One of them has just been released. He's on parole. If he aggressed you, he could do it to others. Mind taking another look? No. I'm sure. Thank you for coming. Goodbye. I want my bag. I'm going back. I'll go back to them. I'll tell them I got frightened. I was confused. I'll tell them it was you. I'll tell them you attacked me, hit me to rob me. I want my bag. Understand what I'm saying? I don't have your bag. I never hit you. Who will they believe? You or me? Go and tell them what you want. What do you expect? Come with me. - No way. - Want me to scream? I'm parked over there. Where are you going? I don't have your bag. Want d'you want? Hey, what d'you bloody want? You know to rob other things than bags? - Okay. - That bank... I'm going to rob it. - With you. - What are you talking about? You want money, right? Those 3 ATMs, on the side there. 3 months ago, they left with 500,000 euros. What the heck? They were only 2. They've never been found. My husband worked there. I guess you know that, huh? You searched my bag, right? We owe them money. And I'll go and get it. - Take from them what we owe them. - Find someone else. What are you waiting for? For another woman with a bag? You can't take just anybody to rob a bank. - They won't get done again. - They've not touched anything. The works will be done in the summer. We'll do like them, like they did. Not me. I don't know to do that. How do you know? You've got nothing to lose, huh? The door, there, on the side. A guy comes through every night to fill up the ATMs. The breach is when he opens that door. You're following me? It's not harder than snatching a bag. I'll give you one third of what we get. I'll be here tomorrow, 6 pm, to see him pass that door. Bring my bag back. I'll be here. - Where were you? - I had a student. A beginner. It lasted on and it was far away. Stop giving evening classes. Don't cut across Paris for a student. You need a phone. - They're asleep? - Yes. What did you make them? Pasta. And... I went there. They called me. Where did you go to? The conservatoire in the 9th district is looking for a teacher. Is there any left? - What? - Pasta. Sorry.

Forget about me. That's not for me. That stuff's not for me. - You've mistaken. - Why have you come? Behind the door, there's a safe near the machines. They drop the notes there. - They don't fill up the machines. - You've been there yourself? Your husband told you? What was his job? - I know it, that's all. - He knows you're here? Their machines have to stay full. On weekends and bank holidays, it's double. In 10 days, it's Easter. The guy fills up the machines with the notes from the safe, alone and unarmed... I think. - What do you mean "you think"? At Christmas, he was taken aback. No one was hurt. He gave them the money. People like that end up in prison. That guy upstairs is looking at us. Guys like that, they're all over, watching. That's why in the nick we're 8 in each cell. A guy who saw you or who saw anything else. If you come back tomorrow, there'll still be someone. I'll take a room at that hotel. No one will watch me. I'm afraid, too, you know... what do you think? - Never mind if you've only got one. - You're being picky. Leave it. I'll settle later. Can you set the table? It'll soon be ready. The garage might have someone for the car. I saw my brother. He gave a cheque for the rent. - Why did you tell him about it? - Oh, yes, I wonder why I did? Maybe because we don't have dough. They'll stop the visits for this month. And what happens in one month? You know what'll be nice? That you believe in me, just a wee bit. I'll find a job. We'll have a house later. Don't be strolling late in the evening. I'm not strolling. I'm not having fun. Even though I don't get much, I can't sit pretty. I keep looking at the door when I don't see you coming. I go on thinking of that guy who jumped on you, you know. When is your appointment? 11. Why? There's a meeting at school tomorrow. I can't go. Come to table, kids! We can leave them one hour alone. The neighbour's there. What's that? The summons for the date of the sale. Come to table, kids!

I'd like a room. They all give onto the street? It's calm at night. Mainly at the back. No, it's okay. I mean... I don't mind the road. Do you have any free? It's per night, even you leave before. You're alone? No. No, I'm not. I'll pay you for a week. The money's missing. - There was 50 euros. - There was 80. Who was that guy with you? In the street. He gave you a light. A guy with a light. What are you afraid of? At Christmas, they went in by the false ceiling. Your husband was kicked out, right? You're doing all this for him? They were two. Only one went in. You're really serious? You reckon? A guy snatches my bag and we go to the hotel to celebrate? He let the guy go in, switch off the alarm and open the safe. The cameras are off. The workers don't want to be filmed. - How did the guy go in? - By the ceiling, I told you. How did he go in? How long did you stay? In jail. One year and a half. And twice 10 months, long ago. On parole, what does it mean? That they watch you, huh? You thought you'd find a graduate with no record? In and ad? When will you tell him? Your husband. When he'll come to visit you to give you news? How did he get through? At the back of the building, they sawed a window bar. - They did works there. - I thought we had to do the same? It's the only way. We'll do the same. Exactly the same. Who "we"? It's impossible now. How to get to that ceiling? I don't know. You're the burglar. Why did you go to prison? What do you want? To know if I'm dangerous? That excites you? What do you think I was there for? I needed to eat. I wanted what I couldn't have, like everybody. Like you. But for that, one has to be in your state: mad. Madness is contagious, you didn't know? They, too. They'd like to have more. But they go home. They don't go robbing banks. You really need that much what's there? What'll you do with it? We have to move. That's what you're mad about? A bloody house? It's not for a bloody house. It's for us. There, it's now. He's going to switch off the alarm and open the safe. Anybody ever said no to you? At Christmas, it hardly took 2 minutes. How did they go in without setting off the alarm? At night, there are alarms all over. I'd better go. You paid the night? Can I sleep here? I need some money too. What's your name? Let's stay strangers. Show me your tooth. I can't see anything. Smile. If I swallow it like the other one, I won't get money? Don't worry. That's the fairy's job. Mischief! Rinse yourself. I'll go to daddy. Okay? Tom's tooth's going to fall, he's so happy. Why did you take it all off? I called the town hall. They'll collect the mess. Your sister called. You have no time for her? Yes, I'll call her back. - You'll fetch Léo at judo class? - Yep, I'm gone. They found it. They called me, I went and got it. Where did they find it? I didn't quite get it. At a gang's place, with other stolen stuff. - They took the money. - And the guy? No, they didn't find him. Mummy! It's fallen at last! Mummy... If we're not going to move, why did the headmistress say we won't go back next term? To which school will we go? We'll leave this place? Yes, we'll go away. Where will you put it? What? Your table soccer. Give me a kiss, a nice one. - Night, my love. - Night night.

And... what if we want to stop the procedure? How do we get back the house? Come on, now. Sign and let's go. Equipment room Why make yourself sick over this house? I've got a class. I'm going to be late. What the heck? Where are you? What are you bloody up to? Let's see to what we have, not to what we don't. We still have it. It's only on 20th May. I went to the court. It will only be sold on the 20th May. We've not lost yet. You're going mad. I need you more than a house. Go now. You're going to be late. Go. Thank you. Will your husband want this money? He won't ask you to give it back? Don't come back and ask me. - Someone came here? - No, nobody. The alarms point to the floor. They crossed the false ceiling without setting it off. It will go off before that. You first have to enter. Here are the tellers. Here's a desk to fill up papers, deposit cheques. And in front, the corridor with offices. I know. I went to take a look. What? It's okay, I was clean. There were plenty people. No one noticed me. The toilets for the staff are here. You need a code. You can access the false ceiling through the toilets, before they close. You must get yourself locked in. And normally, you'll have time to get across to the machines, before they come to fill them up. Why won't I fall through the ceiling? - Because they've already done it. - But not me. I have no weapon, not even a penknife. I've never stolen anybody. Didn't you snatch my bag? You weren't scared? I was. I'd never done it before that. And I fell on yours! How did you learn? Nowhere. I just learnt not to make empty promises. What if they've already done the works? How to go to the crapper? By doing the code. It's... 2927. If it hasn't changed since I've been there. - When was that? - When we signed the loan. What if it changed? "What if..." What if the guy at the window called the cops? What if the hotel staff is eavesdropping? If it's all messed up, why are you still here? For you. You know why you're here? What is it that you don't have? You dream about it at night? A tidy life in your Playmobil house? With a garden, flowered curtains and slippers not to dirty the place? You risk 10 years, what for? What d'you think will be behind that door? A blank cheque you'll write your name on? What will you tell them with your load of notes? You'll recognise your kids when you're released? I too made promises to my daughter. And I didn't see her grow up. Don't you see we're alike? We're 2 amateurs pretending to believe. How old is she? She's 7. I might know of someone... You could deposit a cheque from them. Because you're right. We'll make it. We'll keep to our promises. - Mummy, saw my magic box? - Nan is waiting for you. Dress up. Mummy, you're not ready? - I am. Go down, I'm coming. - Let's go. I'll leave at 2. I've got 2 pupils. - You're not taking me to Hugo's? - Okay, I'll come and get you. - We're here! - You'll take him? - Where's your necklace? - The clasp broke.

They're waiting upstairs. It's 20 %. They'll be deducted from your investment. The gains will amount to your investment minus 20%. You'll get a cheque in your name. Sorry, but I don't get it at all. How can I be sure I'll get a cheque? And when will I have it? How could you know you're going to win? I didn't ask you where your money's coming from. Don't ask me how I'm able to know. When you're ready to invest, you know where to find me. I need money for day after tomorrow. Who're they? What are you doing with them? The races are rigged? How can they be sure they'll win? There are just winners and losers. Don't try to understand where the gains are from. And what's your goal? They know what we're going to do? Who do you think they are? You wanted to act as rogues. What did you tell them? What do they know about me? - Hello. - Hello. - Sorry. - It's okay. Tom, see, mummy's here. Do your magic trick for her. Come, my love? - Where were you? - At Rémi's. I kept on calling you. Why didn't you answer? - What if I told you... - What if you told me what? What if I told I'm cold... would you hold me in your arms? You're sure? You want me to hold you in my arms? How long do you think I'll hold out? Not feeling like coming home in the evening? Watching you get up every night? How long will I manage? Tell me what the hell's going on. What are you up to every evening at 6? So? What are you up to? I went to see a lawyer. You went to see... Because they had no right... to take away everything from us. But... Go and see your lawyers, I don't care. Do your stuff. Go. Tom... what time will daddy come back? Did he say? I don't know. He's playing soccer with Léo. What are you doing at my place? Let go of me. You came and got me. I'm stopping. We'll go through with it. - I'm stopping. - Look at me. Look at me! We're going to do it. You should have thought earlier. It's too late now. It's odd, but we'll do it. Maybe it's our chance. We won't have another one. The guys we've been to see, I owe them money. Know what it means? Now that we've been there, we have to go back. In 2 days, 4:45 pm. I'll park in front of the bank. In a grey car. Don't take any bag. No papers, no phone, nothing. How old are your kids? They surely have a gun that looks like a real one. Where were you? How did that happen? At soccer. I'm yours. Let's start again. It's okay, mummy. It doesn't hurt. "And Gossip Stork engaged to come and dine. "The feast was frugal, all expense was spared." - So, do I learn the rest? - Yes, read from here on. "prepared..." "The gallant...

Nobody's here. He left. - When? - Yesterday. He gave up the room. You want it back? Tom's in bed. He's waiting for you. Could I help you paint the corridor? - Who'll take me to Lucas, tomorrow? - I can't. Mummy, you'll take me? My appointment's at 4. It'll take time. - I'm starting in a week. - Starting what? My teacher's leaving. Can't you see I'm talking to daddy? What are you starting? Sales agent. I'll be selling insurances, in a nice suit. Why didn't you tell me? - Go, he's waiting for you. - Who? Tom of course. He's waiting. They called me this morning. They agreed. On trial. Mummy, can I give up my geography to you? Yes, honey. I'm coming. You can give it up to me, if you like. Tom, stop, please. Come. Come on. We're all three going to read. Why's your prof leaving? Your teacher. She's going to have a baby. "Oceans and continents, listed per size, could be compared.

See you this evening, honey. - See you. - We're getting late! See you. Bend your head for the cameras. Press there. It's with a card, no trace. After you call me about the van, go and park by the door. If I don't come out or whatever, leave on foot. The guy facing the crapper, make him turn his back. Where did you sleep? Why did you go? There. Excuse-me, can I see someone about my account? We're closing. It's not possible, sorry. - Come back on Tuesday. Bye. - Bye. Everyone's left. They're here. Umm... I just wanted to... I just wanted to say... if I move some day... I promise you that... there'll be no flowered curtains. And... And that... there'll be no slippers in the entrance. And also that...

Stay quiet! - Don't move. - Put your legs apart! We're holding him down. He's apprehended. Move back, ladies and gents. How many were you? You were alone? Got a bag? Hey, answer! No, he's got nothing. - Come on, 200, take him. - Let's go. I didn't wake you up because... Because I didn't know how to tell you. I didn't know how to tell you that... I lied to you.
