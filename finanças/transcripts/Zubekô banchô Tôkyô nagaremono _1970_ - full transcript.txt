A Toei Presentation Female Genitals What Does a Fetus in the Womb Look Like Anti-STD Campaign As I have already explained to you... the female body includes organs of various shapes. It has tunnels and forests. Among them, there is also a unique kind of forest. So, it is more complex and high- maintenance than the male body... - Do you mean mysterious? - Sorry for the English word. It has some mysterious sides... Those dangling... Doctor! Please focus. It's a challenging job for me to figure out what kinds of things are happening in your bodies. We are going to examine your bodies thoroughly. Before that, I want to ask something. Anyone who has not pooped for more than 3 clays? Anyone who hasn't had her first period yet? Anyone who has broken their important part? If you fall under one of those, please come to me. Pay Dr Takasagi at the National STD Center a visit and have the broken road fixed. What do you mean by fixing the road? - Our body is not some kind of road! - Do you think we are idiots? And then you can have a happy marriage after graduating from school. The end. Doctor! I want a boyfriend. I want to have your baby. Do as you please! But the baby will come out like... Doctor! It's over! Listen! This school is different from other schools. There are no virgins here! I don't know how it became like this, but I'm jealous! I think I am going crazy again. I'm distracted again. Okay. Next! Mari! So you are Mari. Take a seat. Take a seat. What? Aren't you taking that off? Take it off! Otherwise, I can't use this properly. No! No? I need to do my job here. Take it off please. - Hey! - Yes. He can't examine you like this. No! She will take it off now. Take it off! Hey! - Take it off! - No! No! No! - Take it off! - No! Stop it! Let her go! - Aren't you taking it off? - What are you doing? Who are you? You're supposed to come in and show your tits when the nurse calls your number Ridiculous! Are you having fun touching girls? You're too handsy, mister! - What? Mister? I'm a doctor! A doctor! - Cut the crap! If a girl doesn't want to undress, it means she's pregnant, on her period or has a STD. Doctor, please, do your job properly! She is right! Why don't you undress? - My chest isn't muscular - It's okay! I heard male nudity is a thing nowadays. Wait! Stop! What are you doing, everyone! Spare me! Please! At least let me keep my underwear! Please! I beg you! Principal's Office No! No! Our school is very strict about allowing visits. This is unthinkable. Principal! - Mari is pregnant. - Pregnant? That's right. It's not that we are asking you without proper reason. What are you going to do when you meet him? For girls like us, pregnancy is very important! So she wants to see her boyfriend. She wants to discuss if she should give birth to his baby. - Am I right, Mari? - Yes. As you already know, visits require the permission from her parents. We don't have time to wait! Rules are rules! Mister! I want to meet with Tomi! And I want to talk about the baby inside me... Your pregnancy is unfortunate. Discuss it with the school doctor. Everything will be fine. Mr. Principal! - You won't allow it? - I'm afraid so. - Never ever? - Never! Mari... Enough! That's enough! I'll have an abortion done. I don't care anymore! - I don't care anymore! - Stop it! Everyone! You want to make her dream come true, don't you? You want to help her meet with her boyfriend, don't you? Okay... There is no other choice. Rika! Are we doing... that? No! Why not? You will be released soon. - If you do this now... - What about it? Are you going to let her lose her baby? If I were her, I would hate it. As her friends, we have to help her meet up with her boyfriend! Am I right, everyone? Okay. I got it. Public Bath Here! Put this on! - Be careful, okay? - Okay. You can ask one of the dump truck drivers on the road to give you a ride. They look tough outside but they are kind inside. I think they will give you a ride to Tokyo. Okay. - Ready? - Yes. She is ready! Okay! Everyone! Ready? Okay! The water is good today. We are not brothers and sisters descended from the same parents. We are sworn brothers and sisters with even stronger connections. Even if this cup is small, I bet my life on this cup of drink. Bitch! What are you doing? Let me go! - Bitch! - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! Ready? One, two, three! - We got it! - Let's go! - Everyone! Let's go! - Yes!

The monks from Nikko Toshogu said that women who always complain are not proper women. Komachi Anadachi, a well-known person, died because of that. You have to take care of your son and wife. And sometimes things don't go well. There is no good solution. Husbands always have lots of things to worry about. There are no crows in the sky. It is just filled with smoke. Anyway, white snow won't fall today. Smoke in the sky and sludge in the sea. The god of nature will be very surprised. This is no laughing matter! You live next to bombs. But nobody will save you. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Our country has a convenient thing called law. This book called The Legal References will save you. It includes a lucky charm from Mt. Narita. Usually, you can only find this kind of book in bookstores run by the government. But I think people are in a dangerous situation nowadays, so I want to save people. Do you understand me? But! One thing! Everybody! You should buy it with your own money. Stealing people's money in the crowd is bad! Okay, everyone! These are all I have! One book for the cheap price of 300 yen. Hey! Wait there! - Give it to me! - What? I saw it! What? If you give it up now, I will let you go. Give it to me. I don't care what you do, but I won't let you steal money from my customers. Okay. Okay. You're uptight. What is this? Written Pledge - Miss! - Huh? Here! Did you steal it? Bastard! You were totally distracted, that's why he took it. It's not your business. I'm such a gentleman for taking care of a naive girl like you. What did you just say? Unfortunately, I'm a busy man. I have no time for taking care of a kid. Be careful next time. Hey! I want you to have this. What is this? I'm showing my gratitude. See you! Hey! Miss! Excuse me! What? What is this? Are you looking for a job? - What if I am? - That's perfect! I have a perfect job for you! Are you interested? - Are you serious, mister? - I'm serious. - It's called Sales Promotion. - Sales Promotion?

Am I wrong? But something is different. Rika! Please! We only have two members in this clan. Please save our clan. You don't have to work here forever just until the festival.

I think Shinjuku is better than Kinshicho. Why don't you start looking for some opportunities? But a rookie like me can't... I think you can help me. That will make us invincible. Well... In order to open another business, we need a good signboard. Historically, the best signboard of Shinjuku has been managed by the Gasetora clan. You have to snatch that from the clan. Anyway, please take care of it. Okay, leave it to me. I don't think they can survive through the festival. Of course, we still have to be very careful. Yes. Yes! Roasted garlic is ready! Hey! Mister! How about the garlic? Your family would like it. It smells good. Buy some garlic please! Thank you very much! Mister! Damn! They are Kuroe's guys. It's their fault though. What are you talking about?

We have a new member People call me Otama. Nice to meet you. I like your attitude. Let's have proper greetings later Come up I've brought two new members too. - New members? - They are inside.

I would like to join but I can't. Why? Actually, I'm going to get married! Getting married? - To a guy? - Of course. What does he do? He's a clan member What? A yakuza? Well, he is very pure. Of course, he was not into me initially, but he is totally into me now. You can't be sure yet. Loving someone. being loved by someone... That's the purpose of our lives. - Is it? - I guess.

There you go. Idiot! Are you trying to cook me? Please lie down. You're quite chubby. You have to reduce your meals. Idiot! Are you the No. 1 of this place? Hamamura told me. Do you know him? I'm a clan member too, but my rank is higher than his. Is it? Hey, would you become my girlfriend? I'm better than him in many ways. Well, I'm going to quit anyway. Quitting? I will go back to his hometown. Goodbye, Tokyo. Wake up everyone! Wake up! Wake up over there! What are you doing? Do you need light to wake up? Seethe light and wake up! Wake up! Who is this arrogant ass? Wake up! Just for a second. That was close. Hey! Hey! Wake up! What's this? It's too early. What's this? You're official members of the Gasetora clan. Clean up everything. Clean. Clean. What is that? What a mess. What is this? - Coisamu? - Condoms. Hey! Wake up! Wake up! - Honey! - It's cold. Street vendor work isn't as easy as I thought. That's right. I thought selling hotdogs would be enough. Huh? It's come loose. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? This is a treasure of the Gasetora clan! - Where is madam? - She is out. - Where to? - To get supplies. She is different from you guys. She woke up in the morning and went to buy supplies. National Street-Vendor Association-Certified Sawada Store What? You won't sell supplies to us? Ms. Oran, please don't ask for the reason. Our business relationship comes from your father's generation. I would do anything if I could, but I can't. I'm sorry. I can't give you supplies anymore. Please don't take it personally. I got it. I will find out who is behind this. Sorry for troubling you. The Gasetora clan is finished now. Welcome back. How was it? You're back madam? What happened? Excuse me. Yes. Is the madam here? Well... You brought a lot of crew for your visit. I have something to discuss with the Gasetora clan. What is it? Regarding the festival, I've heard that your business is not going well at the moment. Mr. Kuroe! I've heard that you can't even get supplies. I don't think you will be able to manage your booth during the upcoming festival. I think the historical signboard of the Gasetora clan will go down. I know what you're trying to do. You need the Gasetora clan's signboard, don't you? That's not what I said. Okay, I will take care of your supplies problem. Would you like to give me something in return? I've heard that your Kinshicho business is not doing well. What about it? You're responsible for threatening the Sawada Store, aren't you? What? Our boss kindly comes here to talk with you. It's okay. In the end, you will come to me with your signboard. See you. Madam! What? Dirty yakuza bastards! But if we can't get supplies... Rika, don't worry. I will do something about it. Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! If only Bon was here. Bon? Her son. Madam has a son. He said he hated the street-vendor business, cut ties with the family and ran away. It's already been 5 years. So where is he now? I don't know. The family consisted only of mother and son. They loved each very much because they only had each other She has done an incredible job keeping the signboard until now. All because she expects her son to come back one day. Where is he now? Mr. Matsu! We will do something about supplies. No way. The owner of the store is... Then we can find another route. Really?? Hey! Mr. Kazuo! - You! - I need you for a second. You! I'm busy. Actually, I want your toys. And we want your dump truck as well. I refuse. You're so mean, Mr. Kazuo. It's only between us! There is nothing between us. Mister, you touched Rika, didn't you? - Am I right, Rika? - Yes. I will tell the guardian that you harassed me. Should I tell your boss too? Boss! Boss! Are you going to sell or not? Decide now! Hey! What... Forced? No way! Harumi and I slept together under mutual consent. No! It's a lie! He raped me! He fucked me! He forced himself on me! Did he? Did he? Did he force you? You have a rapey face. - My face has nothing to do with it. - Mister! Did you rape my cute brother? I will kill you! Are you okay? Calm down, Tsunao! - Ah, brother! - Mister! You molested my brothers ass like this. You harassed it, didn't you? I like her! I like her! I like her! Mister! Let's settle this with money. - Give me money. - I don't have money. Do you want me to collect your entire inventory? This, this, this, everything? What is this? What is this? It's a viper I hate it. Just give me the medicine! What is going on? We've brought the supplies by ourselves. Rika! - They are tacky, though. - But they are still supplies. Now we can sell them by ourselves. Good! Let's sell them all! Right, honey? We can set up a proper store for the festival with these. Thank you. To be honest, I didn't know what to do. We can't run any business without supplies. Thank you very much. You saved me. Thank you. Takamatsu Festival Welcome. Welcome. Hey! Wait! - What? - Miss! - What do you want, you idiots? - Who do you think we are? - I don't know. - Shut up you pig! We are famous. She doesn't know... Let's explain it to her - That's too short. - Stop playing with me. Once you get out of this town, you will see us. That's right. People call us the Three Flower Brothers. - That's right. - Another nickname we got is Skyline. - Suka... What? - Hey! Are you stupid, bitch? Skyline! - Hey! - Who are you? - Move over! Hey! Sukasuka? - Pronounce it properly! It's Skyline! I don't care, asshole! - What? - Who do you think we are? The Gasetora clan! Do you have any business with our clan? - That's a good question. - I'm all ears for you. We have the same kind of supplies. What are you going to do about that? That's just a coincidence. - Shut up Bald Patch! - What did you just say, bastard? Are you going to harm our clan's reputation with your bald patch? What did you just say? Your clan is harming our clan's reputation. - Do you want a fight, bitch? - Let's do it! Boss! You don't have to do anything. I will take care of them. - Can you do it? - Of course! I can beat them in no time. Shut up baldie! Let's do it! Follow us to the backyard, idiot! ls something up? - We moved in sync. - This makes me laugh. - Let's do it! - What? You bastard! Wait! Wait a moment! Wait a moment! You must be Mr. Oba. - You must be Ms. Gasetora. Welcome! - Nice to see you again. I'm glad to see your bright face. Okay, please come inside and drink some tea. Thank you for your offer. - Buzz off! - Move, asshole! Mr. Oba. Won't you greet us at all? Sorry about that. I can see that you're from the Nishikimoto clan. Sorry if I'm wrong. So! You don't greet the Nishikimoto clan? Of course, I do. Just it's quite full inside. Forgive me. It's okay if you know now. Sorry for the trouble. Please come in together Let's go inside, then. Hello, everyone! What I'm holding right now is a medicine which can heal anything. Miss, my crotch itches. Itchy crotches! This will heal you surprisingly well! But this won't heal your wife's problem. What are you talking about? The more you sharpen a sword, the shiner it will become. Listen, everyone! If I apply a bit of this magical oil, it prevents the sword from cutting a thin cloth. Do it then! Now I slide it in... - I can't cut it! I can't cut it! - It's true. Do you understand? Everyone? If you apply this oil on your skin, you won't get hurt or sick from germs. Do you understand? Everyone? 50,000 people died early because they didn't have this medicine. One of them was Julius Caesar Do you know what he said in the end? I do. Oh, Brutus! You too?! That's right. But in reality, there was more. - I know! Bring me the oil now! - You did well. Mister I'm afraid you need surgery instead of medicine. Don't be ridiculous. Anyway, do you know that famous actor who died recently? He could've escaped his death with this medicine. People say that if we try hard, our dreams will come true. That's a good thing to hear, but it's somewhat unrealistic. Nobody knows when they'll have an accident. So this oil will save you from them. Do you understand now? If so, buy it now! Buy it! Give me one! Wait a second! Give me 20 cases! She is clever What's going on? Focus! You idiot! All the ladies and gentlemen here! Excuse my loud voice. You can't buy this quality bra in Japan. This has been directly imported from Paris, France. So it has a round secret mark here. This should be displayed at stores in Ginza as a new trend. Once you wear it, you will know. Its smooth texture makes even Bridget Bardot cry out in excitement. Take it off! Take it off! What do you think? Good, isn't it? How is it? How is the texture? - It's soo good! - Is it good? It must be very good. However, this is not only for girls. This bra has a convenient feature for guys. - I'm going to take it off now. - Hurry! Hurry! Are you going to buy it? - No. - Then go back to your stall! - Sorry. - Whatever. I got it. Everyone, come closer I'm going to take it off. Why are you so aroused, mister? Ready? I'm taking it off! I did it. Why doesn't it come off? It sticks to her boobs. It depends on the guy's skill. If you buy this for your wife, she can take it off immediately. I want to say 300 yen... But I can sell it for 200 yen to celebrate the autumn festival. Anyone? Handsome guys. I'm impressed. Even the bananas look very manly. Miss, do you want to eat this delicious banana? - Can I have one? - They're delicious. - Really? - This is actually... Why are you eating? There are no customers here. - Am I not attractive enough? - Shut up faggot! I'm wearing this because I'm better-looking than you. - What are you talking about? - That's enough! Anyway, these guys are the reason why we don't have any customers. Brother, should I show them my attractiveness? - What are you talking about? Let's go! - Alright! Miss! This banana is different from the bananas over there. What are you talking about? I'm not even talking about the appearance. It has a lot of vitamins. Show me whether it is actually sweet by licking it. - That turns me on. - Idiot! Hey! If you do it, do it properly. - Shut up! Douchebags! - What did you say? What are you doing, bastards? - It's dangerous. - What are you doing? What did you do? How dare you mess with our clan's business? - What? - Hey! Do you want a taste of our punishment? - What did you just say, bitch? - Wait! - Hey! Nishikimoto punks! - Who are you? How dare you call yourselves street vendors? It's not your business! You guys are too low to call yourselves street vendors. - What did you just say, bastard? - Bastard! Hey, bastard! - What's happening here? - Brother! Hold it. - Bastard! - Hey! - Who are these idiots! - Sorry. Bye. - What happened? - Boss! Is everybody okay? I'm glad. I don't know who you are, but thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Boss! It's Bon. Tsunejiro! Long time no see. I'm glad you look okay. Tsunejiro. What are you wearing? People will always come back to their origin. Are you kidding me? You ran away because you hated selling stuff on the street. Now you're a street vendor? I do what I want to do. I don't need your opinion! What did you just say? You're murmuring this and that. You just talk too much. Idiot! How dare you say such things to your mother? I'm glad you still have some energy to beat those idiots. Take care. Bye. Tsunejiro! Boss! Bon! Stop! Tsunejiro! It's you. I was surprised that you became a member of my mother's clan. Where are you going now? I will just keep traveling. You keep saying those cool lines. Your name is Rika, isn't it? How do you know my name? Written Pledge. The one you wrote when you got out. First, I pledge that I will not do anything bad again. I wrote that too. I enjoyed my time in Kurihama. I see. That's how it was. I was such a baby, so childish. Hey, come back home. - That home? - The boss must miss you so much. She has been waiting for you to come back. I got it. Sometime later You got nothing! It's about the relationship between parent and child. I will be back sooner or later Are you serious? I am. Rika! Thank you. Hey! Sorry for being late. Here it is. 1,000,000. Sorry for troubling you. I will pay you back one day. It's okay. I can go somewhere anyway. Mitsuko! My mother sent me a letter She is waiting for us. She is looking forward to meeting you. I want to go there now. Of course, she will be surprised. Okay, I will be back after delivering the money. Okay. Don't lose it! Be careful! Sorry for interrupting. This is the money I promised. I'm leaving now. Hey! What are you going to do? I'm going back to my hometown. Wait... Are you taking Mitsuko with you? I told you that I'd let you go, but I didn't say I'd let your girl go. You're overdoing it. You can't buy a girl's freedom for only 1,000,000. Do you really need your girl that much? I could let her go... There is just one requirement. A requirement? You need to kill someone. If you do it right, I will let your girl go. What do you think? Hey! Are you going to do it or not? Which is it? I'm coming. Yes. Honey. How was it? Everything went okay? That's great. What? Going to Hokkaido today? - But... - You don't need to pack. Just the two of us. That's right. 4 o'clock in Ueno. Okay? I know you helped me. So many good people came and helped until the festival ended. You must be happy over there. And Tsunejiro has become a street vendor as well. He looks exactly like your younger days. If he ever comes back home, I will come here every day and tell you about it. Who are you? What are you doing? I've brought sake and beer We have everything here. Madam is late. Come to think of it, you're right. Okay, I will check. The train is arriving... The train is scheduled to depart at 15:45.. That's dirty! What are you doing? I'm hungry! She will come soon. We have fresh vegetables. She sure is late. She's here! Welcome back! Madam... Madam! Madam! Madam! The train is scheduled to depart at 16:40.. Ken! This way! Ken! Ken! Get up! Ken! Ken! What happened? What happened? Ken! I'm an idiot. I killed Gasetora. We have been deceived by Kuroe. Kuroe? Ken! Senmitsu! Senmitsu! Senmitsu! Senmitsu! Bon has become a proper street vendor She looked so happy when she said he would come back to the family. Boss!
