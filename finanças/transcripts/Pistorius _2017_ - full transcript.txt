of going to the movies together, and happily joins Oscar at the gym. HOST: Sam, what have you come to love about Oscar? He is lots of fun. He has so much energy. I can't actually keep up with him. [CHUCKLES] OSCAR: She's just really laid back, and she understands some of the demands that I have, and it makes my life a lot easier spending time with someone that's very caring and... You're both blushing. My face is the color of her dress. In the courtroom, there was a huge buzz of anticipation when we heard that the next witness coming up was Samantha Taylor. Oscar Pistorius's girlfriend prior to Reeva. You were in a relationship with him during what period? SAMANTHA: We started dating in 2011. I was 17 years old, my lady. Where did you meet? SAMANTHA: We briefly met at a rugby game in 2010. Thereafter, he added me on Facebook, and we just started talking over social media. There was an incident when you were with the accused at the Vaal. SAMANTHA: Yes. I was with Oscar and Darren Fresco. NEL: Who was the driver of the vehicle? SAMANTHA: On the way to the Vaal, Mr. Pistorius drove the car, and on the way back from the Vaal, Darren Fresco drove the car, my lady. On the way home, we got stopped by the police, because we were speeding. Oscar had left his gun on the seat of the car. When the police had a look, he said to Oscar, that the gun could not just be left on the seat there. Oscar shouted at the policeman, because he said that he was not allowed to touch his gun. After we left there, about two minutes after, I saw Oscar take his gun and shoot out of the car roof. NEL: What did he say? SAMANTHA: They both laughed. MELINDA FERGUSON: Samantha is one of the prototype kind of Oscar girls. Blonde hair, skinny. Looking like a little model. And I think, for a 16, 17-year-old girl, it must have been quite an amazing feeling having this world-famous athlete paying attention. MAN: That is the title of the book, Melinda Ferguson has co-written with Trish Taylor detailing Samantha's 18-month-long relationship with Pistorius. The previous girlfriend testifying... it tells you a lot. And looking at the book of Samantha's mother, An Accident Waiting to Happen. It nearly happened to her. TRISH TAYLOR: He was always, always checking up on her. On a Friday night, he would ensure that she was at home and no where else. She would put her pajamas on to Skype him just to show him that she was in her bedroom and was at home. So he was extremely possessive of her. It was almost like he needed free rein, but he wanted her trapped at home, doing nothing. When did your relationship stop with him? SAMANTHA: The first time or the second time? First time? SAMANTHA: The first time our relationship ended was when he cheated on me with... [SAMANTHA SNIFFLING] [CRYING] I'm sorry, my lady. Just take your time, please. For me, it was clear, that she wasn't over Oscar yet. SAMANTHA: He had gone on a date with a lady called Anastasia. I think he was at New York that day. And that's when we ended our relationship the first time. TRISH TAYLOR: Oscar was seen in New York with this top model. It was everywhere. It was like worldwide news. And, of course, Samantha woke up to that. So she confronted him, and he said, "No, no, they are lying." And he wasn't even in that place, wasn't even in that area. And he blamed the media a lot. When Sam finally started trying to get away from him, that was just before the Olympics, and she started seeing somebody else. MAN: And today, we have a celebrity. Can you tell the world your name? Quinton Van Der Burgh. MAN: Quinton, what's the last name? Van Der Burgh.MAN: Van Der Burgh. MELINDA FERGUSON: Nice-looking guy, lots of money. He's been wining and dining Sam, taking her for tropical island holidays, all sorts of things. I think Oscar is deeply, deeply affected by this. As his time with Olympics went on and on, he became more and more frenetic, more and more depressed, more and more tearful, because he had lost control over Sam. And when he was supposed to get his silver medal, he literally was on the phone to Samantha's sister. He would not go out. And she talked him all the way through until we could hear them calling him. And he was still crying. And she was going, "Oscar, you've gotta go. "You have to get your medal." DAVID O' SULLIVAN: I do recall when I was at the Paralympic Games, hearing from other athletes that he was having these meltdowns in the Olympic Village. And I thought it really strange, because he was riding the wave of glory after the Olympics. He was the poster boy of Paralympics. He was living the dream. Why would he allow himself to be sidetracked by having arguments with his girlfriend? when so much more was happening in his life. He carried on begging, asking for a second chance. And she kept saying, "No, no, no." She wouldn't. He used to start phoning me at all hours of the morning, crying on the phone. "Trish, you've gotta help me get her back again. "I don't know what to do. "Please ask Samantha to give me a second chance. "I really want her. I want to marry her. She's the girl for me." So he was very heartbroken. If you saw him, he just was not the person that lived to go to the Olympics. So I think when she decided to give him a second chance, the second chance started with him in a bad space. MELINDA FERGUSON: Finally, Sam relents and gives him another chance. Leaves Quinton Van Der Burgh, the boyfriend that she's been with. And then somehow, the three of them, are all at this place, a race track called Kyalami. Oscar and Quinton have a big verbal meltdown. There was a war of words between Quinton and Oscar, and escalated to such a degree that Mark Batchelor, who was a friend of Quinton Van Der Burgh, got involved. WOMAN: Mark Batchelor is a former soccer player, who subsequently became a sports commentator in South Africa, but was fired from the sports channel that he worked for, Super Sports, after he was involved allegedly in the assault of an individual at a nightclub. MELINDA FERGUSON: One of the guys around town, I won't call him a gangster, but put two and two together. We had a few words and he started threatening me, and telling me how he was gonna "f" me up, and break my face. I was basically off him. I mean, what is he gonna do? I'm double his size, and I'm not scared to take on anybody, but I'll never ever do that. I actually laughed it off. MELINDA FERGUSON: And then, Oscar invited Sam to go with him to Sun City, where he's screaming at her in the hotel room, not stopping, trying to badger her for details, what happened with Quinton. And then, almost a week later, Sam who was supposed to be going with Oscar to the Sports Awards, is jilted on national television. When she puts the TV on, and Reeva was on the red carpet with Oscar. Hi, I'm Oscar's date tonight. NEL: Is it your evidence that the two of you were on that day still in a relationship? SAMANTHA: We had not officially broken up at that time. What does it mean that you have not "officially broken up"? SAMANTHA: About a week before the Sports Awards, there was a lot of commotion in our relationship. So we were still together, but we were having problems. Ms. Taylor? It seems that every time you speak about him cheating on you, that you get emotionally upset. SAMANTHA: Yes. Barry Roux pretty successfully sowed at the mind of the judge the idea that a lot of the animus against Oscar from Samantha Taylor came from her resentment and bitterness of having been abandoned. And certainly, if the girl at the prosecution had been to present Oscar Pistorius as someone who categorically could be expected to kill someone in a violent rage, that objective again, was not demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt by the testimony of Samantha Taylor. BARRY: Mr. Pistorius states that he did not fire a shot through the sunroof of a car as you testified in your evidence. He says it did not happen. SAMANTHA: I can clearly say that he shot through the sunroof of a car. It became about this person who you have believed to be this heroic figure, is in fact, a narcissistic psychopath, reckless and capable of violence. And we will display the innately damaged and violent person that we are dealing with. NEL: During January 2013, you were at the restaurant with Mr. Pistorius, is that correct? KEVIN LERENA: This is correct, yes. NEL: Which restaurant was that? We were at Tashas in Melrose Arch. NEL: Does that look familiar? KEVIN: Yes, that is the table that we were sitting at. They were trying to show Oscar Pistorius, I think, as a bit of a brat. As someone who had, perhaps, anger issues. And they really tried to use the evidence that they built up using not only the evidence relating to the night of the incident, but other things. The evidence relating to how he'd handled himself with guns. What happened there at Tashas? The accused had please asked me to pass my firearm to him. I had taken the weapon out from my carry position, and passed it to him under the table. As soon as his hands had touched the weapon, I said to him, "There is one up." NEL: What did you understand by "one up"? That there's one loaded into the chamber. What happened next? A shot went off in the restaurant and then, there was just complete silence. I was in shock and I looked down, on the floor and there was a hole in the floor, but I wasn't hurt or injured. I was scratched from the shrapnel. I don't know what from but there was blood on my toe, yes. Just shortly after that shot went off, who said what? KEVIN: I do remember Oscar vaguely say, "I don't know what happened, how the gun went off." But he did apologize and say," I'm so sorry, it was a mistake. "Are you okay? Is everybody okay?" And what happened thereafter? I do remember Oscar saying to Darren, "Please take the blame for me. "There's too much media hype around me, just take the blame for me." The State is hoping to use this evidence to portray the Paralympian as gun obsessed and unwilling to take responsibility for his mistakes. I certainly wouldn't classify him as an expert with firearms. But he was familiar with firearms most certainly. He not only went through the training, but he was also a firearm enthusiast. So he would go to the shooting range, and shoot as a recreational shooter. A lot of attention was placed, both, in the courtroom and outside the courtroom on Pistorius's engagement with firearms, with fast cars, with beautiful women. With a very particular vision of white, privileged masculinity in South Africa and connected relationship with firearms. DEBORA PATTA: Oscar Pistorius fired a loaded gun in a restaurant where there were children just nearby. And nobody blinked. What was this big threat that he was so terrified of that was coming to get him all the time? I was awakened by three loud bangs. And I said, "I think it's gunshots." And I walked to the balcony. I heard screaming. Sounded to me like the voice of a female. So, I phoned 10111. While I was still busy on the phone, I heard another three loud bangs. It sounded much like the first set of sounds. And I looked at the clock radio and then it said 3:17. JOHAN STIPP: So I dressed to go to the house. When I got there, there was a lady lying on her back and he said, "I shot her. "I thought she was a burglar." She was clenching down on Oscar's fingers as she was trying to open her airway. Oscar was crying all the time. He prayed to God. "Please let her live. She must not die." To me, it was obvious that she was mortally wounded. He really, honestly believed that Oscar Pistorius was sincere, and he did want Reeva Steenkamp to live. He wasn't painting a picture of a cold-blooded premeditated murder that the State is going to argue Oscar Pistorius in fact is. One thing is common cause. The accused fired four shots. And no other shots. You must find another reason for the noise sounding like gun shots, you understand? JOHAN STIPP: I'm with you. BARRY: The last two to three sounds, those sounds were caused by a cricket bat breaking down the door. But it sounded to you again like gunshots. JOHAN STIPP: You're saying that the first were actually gunshots. BARRY: Yes. JOHAN STIPP: And that the second actually sounds from a cricket bat? BARRY: Yes. There was a first set of banging noises, and there were second set of banging noises. And a number of witnesses for the State to testify that both had sounded like gunshots. You woke up to the shots that he fired. And if that is so, there was fatal wounding, and that's in accordance with my experts. JOHAN STIPP: Yes, you are correct. So, what we know as a fact, the deceased could not have screamed. JOHAN STIPP: If those were shots, she could not have screamed. KELLY PHELPS: Both the pathologist for the State and the pathologist for the defense conceded, and, in fact, Johann Stipp who had a medical degree agreed with this in his testimony as well. That as soon as Reeva Steenkamp received the head injury, she would have been incapable of screaming. It's the State's case, that it was the deceased that screamed. There are two sets of noises. We say that the shots of 3:17 killed the deceased. JUDGE MASIPA: And before 3:17 a.m.? NEL: She was alive and screaming. How we'll argue and what we'll do will become clear. Now for the first time today, we have a sort of degree of concession from the State that there were two distinct sets of noises. But they say the shots that were fired at 3:17, those noises that Pistorius says were the sounds of the bat, were, in fact, the shots that killed Reeva Steenkamp. It was clear very early on in this trial that the State's murder case was really going to revolve around three pieces of evidence. The evidence of the sounds of the cricket bat hitting the door, the evidence of the gunshots that were heard, and the evidence of allegedly hearing a woman screaming. BARRY: If we look at this door, it is consistent, and I think it's conclusive, in fact, that when the shots were fired, the door was intact. It was not broken. That is true, my lady. What is your view? When was the door hit? Before or after the shots? My lady, I would say, the door was hit after the shots. KELLY PHELPS: We know from the forensic evidence that the cricket bat was used to break down the door after the firearm had been shot. So, at the time the shots were fired, the door was still intact. BARRY: Colonel, photo 11 and the same Colonel... [INDISTINCT] Affidavit. Look at it carefully. VERMEULEN: It's actually shoe prints. BARRY: Shoe prints? Like police shoe prints? [CHUCKLES] That's possible. Yes, My lady. DAVID KLATZOW: There was never ever a good reason to unscrew the door, to stand on it, to lose bits of it, to take to the laboratory, to return it. Nothing was done to that door at the lab that couldn't have been done with the door in situ better. I said," Take down the door. We have pictures. "We put it in the only office that has one key, the Colonel's office. "We put it in the big body bag. It's safe." Hilton Botha, the inept policeman, wandered around the scene without any protective clothing. That is a strict no-no. You don't do that. But that was not necessary because the scene was taken pictures of already. Everything was removed. And we knew who was in the house. Only them. You make certain that you are properly clothed in adequate forensic clothing. That you have your footwear cover, that your hair cover. All of those things 'cause you drop DNA all over the place. If I had it in my vehicle, I wouldn't have used it anyway. I never scribe anything to any kind of conspiracy that is equally, adequately explained by sheer incompetence. And in this particular instance, we are dealing with sheer incompetence. It's common to many cases in South Africa that the standard of policing is not what it should be. [SCHOOMBIE VAN RENSBURG TALKING] [LAUGHING] DAVID KLATZOW: The first and most important step in any investigation is that you have to freeze the crime scene in time. That involves cordoning off the crime scene, and it involves making certain that nobody is on the crime scene who oughtn't be there. GERARD LABUSCHAGNE: They were up to, I think, 70 people who had been on the crime scene at one point in those early hours of it. So you had at the initial crime scene responders. Then you had provincial crime scene responders. Then you had the National Officers crime scene team had pitched up. So, when my colleague, Lieutenant Colonel Dolonga arrived, he said there was no control. There were people coming in and out. I should have taken tape, and tied the lamp post together to keep the people off the cordon. In the street, there were too many people knowing too much and walking around. It's not a movie being made. It's a crime scene and you are not allowed here. But the thing is, when I got there, I don't know how many people were there. After a while, I think it got out of hand. VAN RENSBURG: I noticed this box of watches, eight watches on that. And then I said, "We have to look after the property in this house. "It's an expensive property." I actually saw one of the watches and thought, "That was a nice watch." And then, everything was fine. When I came back, the Colonel told me that one watch was stolen. There were, apparently, two guys, also cops there. And then after that, he started writing down who came in and searching them when they got out. KELLY PHELPS: The extension cord as well went missing from police custody on the 14th of February, 2013. How it was lost, that is my concern. How? My lady, I cannot even advance... No, no, I'm not happy. But at the same time, I don't know how I could order the State to produce something they say is lost. Who's the person that controlled the house, that sealed the house? What does he say? I didn't see an extension cord or look for extension cord. Obviously, the photographer has looked at the pictures after and said,"Yes, it was there." But now, it's gone. I don't know what happened to it. Who will take an extension cord, now really? I mean, someone took the watch already. Now that immediately suggests that there are unauthorized people wandering around. What else was taken? Where were the cellphones? FRANCOIS MOLLER: I received two iPhones from warrant officer, Hilton Botha. When I received my initial data from the service providers, my lady, I realized that Mr. Oscar Pistorius had a second cellphone with the number 0020 that weren't seized from the crime scene. There was a cellphone charging in the kitchen. The report said that Oscar's phone was in the kitchen being charged and the next thing, it's gone. The South African police did seize the phone eventually. It was sent away for analysis. They even took it as far as Washington to Apple in order to try and retrieve, et cetera. But apparently there was a break in the chain of evidence. So, when the phone comes back eventually, and it's unlocked and the information on the phone is accessed, it shows that the phone is being plugged into a computer called Titanium Hulk. Surprise, surprise is the Twitter handle of his brother, Carl. HILTON BOTHA: The phone was on charge when I got in there. And then when I started to gather all the phones to send to Moller, they told me Carl took the phone in the kitchen. So I thought maybe it was not his phone. I don't know whose phone it was. We didn't have time to check it. TOBY SHAPSHAK: Why, in the midst of all of this is Carl Pistorius plugging Oscar Pistorius's phone into his computer? And what exactly was he doing? What seems to have happened, because we don't know definitively, he was wiping the phone, and he was making sure there was nothing on the phone that the cops could get. Unfortunately, it doesn't prove anything. Unfortunately, it's not admissible in a court case. But this stuff specifically, kind of, makes one smell a rat. CARL: No comment is comment enough. Let's just first have a look at the phone calls themselves. You know, we get the data from the cellular networks. This is pretty useful information in tracking the time of how things happened. So interestingly enough, one of the last calls he makes at seven minutes past 6:00 is to his ex-girlfriend, Jenna Atkins, who in his phone is called Baby Shoes. MELINDA FERGUSON : So Jenna Atkins was the blonde girlfriend before Oscar was with Samantha Taylor. And who Samantha always suspected to be the other woman in their relationship. So for me, why wouldn't the presence of Jenna have carried on in Reeva and Oscar? Because Jenna was someone who had an incredibly strong connection to Oscar. And then there's a quite a long call at 8:25 to his cousin. No activity until 3:19 a.m. when he makes a phone call to Stander. Now, if we look at the data usage of his phone at that time, this is very similar kind of pattern. But in the middle of all of this, there's a very suspicious amount of data and it is at 1:48 in the morning. The duration of the data connection is 309 seconds, which is five minutes and 15 seconds. And it amounts to 58 kilobits. If that was one individual message or a photograph or WhatsApp message. The interesting thing about this is it's about 10 minutes before one of his neighbors says she hears a lot of arguing. MELINDA FERGUSON: Most people think, "Oh, Reeva was so beautiful." "I'm sure Oscar was so jealous of Reeva." And she must have been cheating. But what happens if it was the other way round? What happens if it was Oscar who was cheating? And Reeva who was insecure and jealous, feeling like her relationship was falling apart. So, for me, it's very interesting to think of it the other way. That it was Reeva who was trying to see what messages were being sent to Oscar's phone. But we'll never know. We don't have his phone. We don't have the data. Titanium Hulk wiped the data. All we have is the Reeva Steenkamp's side of the conversation. I included all the chats, all the communication that was saved on the specific device. between the accused and the deceased. JOHN CARLIN: There was huge anticipation in the courtroom among the millions of viewers worldwide when we knew that the next morning we were gonna get the thousands of WhatsApp messages that Oscar and Reeva had exchanged. Here, they were gonna find the motive. FRANCOIS MOLLER: "Today was one of my best friend's engagement, "and I wanted to stay longer. "I was enjoying myself, but it's over now. "I was not flirting with anyone today. "And I'm sorry that you think that little of me. "You made a scene at the table "and made us leave early. "I'm scared of you sometimes of how you'll react to me. "I get snapped at and told my accent and voices are annoying. "I touch your neck and you tell me to stop. "Stop chewing gum. "Do this. Don't do that." JUNE STEENKAMP: I think that Oscar was very unkind to her. He didn't treat her very nicely. He was all about him. She was to be one of his accessories. But she was her own person. She was too strong for that. She could have never been Mrs. Pistorius. FRANCOIS MOLLER: "I'm the girl who fell in love with you "and wanted to tell you this weekend." JUNE STEENKAMP: I think it just happened. They were tremendously attracted to each other, but she had her doubts. She actually said that in a text to him. "I just want to love and be loved. "Be happy and make someone so happy. "Maybe we can't do that to each other '"cause right now, I know you aren't happy "and I'm certainly very unhappy and sad." JUNE STEENKAMP: The one day, she said he was cross with her, because he's had a bit of a scrap with her and then he decided to leave. So he took off to the exit and then, she had very high heels on, so she had to walk slowly. And then he was cross with her about that, that she took so long to get to when he was leaving. FRANCOIS MOLLER: "I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that, "especially not so loudly so that others could hear. "I thought myself as a lady "and I didn't feel like one tonight." He said something to her that moved her from this beautiful smiling girl to this girl who just went red, and before I knew it, she was crying. So for me, it kinda was, like, did he say something that really did upset her? FRANCOIS MOLLER: "I can't be attacked by outsiders for dating you "and be attacked by you, "the one person I deserve protection from." A relationship of three months... You know, it's honeymoon. But in this one, you ask yourself, "What kind of a person is Oscar?" What kind of a person was this man? JUNE STEENKAMP: It was almost like he wanted her all to himself. In a country where we have a lot of domestic violence, those were warning signals. And if you speak to domestic violence experts, and people who work within that field, they will tell you that those are warning signs. BARRY: You have extracted about five of these, WhatsApp, if I am not mistaken? FRANCOIS MOLLER: That's correct, my lady. And I think, if I understood your evidence correctly, out of 1,704. That's correct. It was more than 1,700. Yeah. Let's get straight to the point. You found four... Relevant to arguing between them? That's correct, my lady.BARRY: That's what you are looking at. That's correct.It's not that they are standing out. You were looking at messages showing some argument between the two. FRANCOIS MOLLER: That's correct.Yes. The messages that the State put forward had been lifted out of the context of a longer conversation that they formed part of. So in cross examination, the defense then put the rest of the conversation on to the record. You refer to argument between them on the 27th? That's correct. Here, we can see 28th of January. It's from Mr. Pistorius It's sending two kisses. Then "Good morning angel. I hope you slept well. Off to gym, kiss." And then, a message back from her. "Good morning boo. I eventually did. Thank you. Enjoy gym angel kiss, kiss kiss." That's after the argument they had. That's correct, my lady. Then the next message that you referred as being relevant. It's an outgoing message from the deceased to the accused. And the message reads, "Morning Ozy." And a smile. His response was, "Morning baba." Again resolved? FRANCOIS MOLLER: That's correct, my lady. When he got into an interpersonal altercation, he could get angry, he could get worked up. But he always had this style of... Perhaps leaving the room or leaving it for an hour or two and then coming back. Saying, "Listen, what happened just now, we need to address this." [GUNSHOTS] There's four shots fired at the crime scene. And all four bullets perforated the toilet door into the toilet cubicle. The first shot, undoubtedly, hit her in the right thigh. CHRIS MANGENA: Most probably, the shot marked 'B' missed her, and it broke into fragments. Then the fragment hit her on the back creating that bruise on her back. So, we've now dealt with bullet hole A and dealt with bullet hole B. Then there're two more bullet holes. The other wound that she sustained, she had a wound on her right arm. And she had a wound on her head. When she's standing up, these two wounds are very high compared to the bullet holes on the door. She has to be down for those wounds to be in line with the bullet holes on the door. CHRIS MANGENA: The arm was lifted up and was in front of her chest. Then we have one more shot. Yes, my lady. Bullet perforated here, but the arm was now in contact with her head, and she was a bit facing down. It comes in here. The bullet break into two fragments. After this wound was inflicted on the head, she dropped immediately. The head ended up on top of the toilet seat. And the upper body was between the toilet seat and the magazine rack. Now, Captain, let us deal with the question of Mr. Pistorius having been on his prosthetic legs or on his stumps? CHRIS MANGENA: To get the accused without the prosthesis, straight in the arms, the shoulder level is close to the trajectory found when placing the laser. The accused is most likely not wearing the prosthesis legs and fired from a distance greater than 60 cm. If he is not wearing his prosthesis, he cannot balance. He must hold something. It's more likely that he was standing towards the wall with his back against the wall when he was shooting. The defense were correct in this in saying that he didn't have his prosthesis on. I've no further questions. Thank you, my lady. JUDGE MASIPA: Thank you. Yes, Mr. Nel? After 15 days and 20 witnesses, the prosecution have wrapped up their evidence And it's now over to team Pistorius to outline their version of events. MAN: Watch, like, tweet, post, follow, engage. A first, channel 199, the Oscar Pistorius trial. ANNALIESE BURGERS: We must remember that by the time we got to the court case, there was a daily television show dedicated to the court case. And it becomes this national obsession. I think it's unprecedented. Certainly, in this country. It's just something that we haven't seen and, I believe, we will never see again. Welcome to the Oscar Pistorius trial channel I'm David O' Sullivan. You're with the legal round table debate. Tonight... DAVID SULLIVAN: I used to sit with a panel of legal experts every evening, talk to them and get them to unpack and put into layman's language what had happened on that day's proceedings. I was staggered by the popularity of that channel. It had double the audience of any other channel on satellite TV bouquet. It was Oscar Pistorius non-stop. People were, kinda, stopping work to watch it. JOHN CARLIN: The whole country was transfixed. You would have crowds gathering outside, huge scrum of TV cameras but also ordinary citizens just coming to see what all the hullabaloo was. It was like this all-absorbing, consuming spectacle. Because his life story was so extraordinary, his fall from grace was just as extraordinary. ANNALIESE BURGERS: The entire media contingent was camped outside the gates of the house. Hot dogs were being sold outside. I mean, there was like entrepreneurs who realized there was a market, and were selling drinks, Coke and so on. It became such an obsession. Everybody wanted to be part of it. KELLY PHELPS: But what I think was a problem with the media attention around this trial, in terms of the country more broadly, is that opportunities were lost. And really important and searing social issues were then left unexplored. The time has come for us to work together again to prepare for the fifth National General elections. I've... Welcome to the high court of Pretoria. What does he say happened that night? New details on the Oscar Pre... Pistorius? Oscar Pistorius killed... All video and audio was banned from the court room. [CLAMORING] Well, the trial was a huge circus, was media circus. It was the trial of the century. DIANNE HAWKER: It definitely was a bit of a show. I mean, you've got Oscar Pistorius arriving every morning with his contingent of body guards. WOMAN: We love you! DIANNE HAWKER: You've got his family all showing up, and they're all looking perfect. But the legal team, there was definitely that element of showmanship. BARRY: Mr. Van Rensburg, I'm told that you are the last witness today, and I'm gonna see if we can use up the court time till 3 o'clock, so I'm just trying to find some more questions. [CROWD LAUGHING] MAN: Wherever someone's having a beer, they are talking about Barry Roux at the moment. And it's interesting to see some of the phrases that have stayed with us for a long time. If I... put it to you, would it make sense? You know how many people put it to me since then? [LAUGHING] A lot of people put it to me since then. For me, it worked out very nicely. Barry became the overnight sensation. And I was just hiding in a corner, leading evidence. KELLY PHELPS: As the trial progressed, the narratives around the trial and the reporting around the trial, tended to denigrate into some sort of group thinking. Tabloid melodrama. He was trolling the internet for porn just before he kills her. But I'll save that for another day. MAN: Actually, Nancy, we just have to get to the weather. But we wanna thank you for[INDISTINCT] And about being tried, he doesn't have a leg to stand on. You possibly think this is entertainment. It is not. So please restrain yourselves. ROBERT SHAPIRO: First of all, he's already testified. And the judge knows that. Because that affidavit is admissible. Second, you cannot have a self-defense case without taking the stand. No judge is gonna rule in your favor unless they hear you reiterate. You're a self defense claim. So, he has to take the stand. TOBY SHAPSHAK: He had to take the stand. This wasn't a who had done it. We know who did it. It was a why done it? Why did he do it? Why did he pull the trigger and shoot four bullets into a locked toilet room? My name is Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius. Use your right hand and say, " So, help me God." OSCAR: So, help me God. MANNIE WITZ: It's probably the loneliest place in the world. Nothing more lonely than being in a witness box. 'Cause you've got no protection. OSCAR: My lady, if I may just please start off with my evidence by tendering an apology. [TEARFULLY] I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to Mrs. and... Mrs. and Mr. Steenkamp, to Reeva's family. To, um... To those of you who are here today. I wake up every morning and you are the first people I think of, the first people I pray for. I can't imagine the pain and the sorrow and the emptiness that I have caused you and your family. I was simply trying to protect Reeva. I can promise you when she went to bed that night, she felt loved. I knew in what state he was. Traumatized. Completely out of his mind. And I thought... It was not a good idea. Mr. Pistorius, I'm taking you now to the events of the 13th of February. OSCAR: That day I had woken up in my house in Pretoria. Reeva had slept over. I got to Johannesburg and I was there till about midday. I didn't have any plans for the afternoon, but I thought that Reeva was gonna come back to Johannesburg. You know, Oscar wasn't supposed to be at his home. He was supposed to stay with friends in Johannesburg. And Reeva invited him. OSCAR: When I spoke to her on the phone, she told me that she didn't want to come back. She was thinking of staying the night again at my house. I arrived home shortly after 6 o'clock. Reeva was preparing dinner in the kitchen. There was a wrapped present on the kitchen counter, and Reeva told me I'm only allowed to open it the next day. We started dinner shortly after 7:00, my lady. I think we both had a taxing day and so after dinner, we decided to go upstairs. I placed the tripod fan a bit further back with one of the legs on the balcony. Placed the small fan pretty much in between the legs of the larger fan. I then closed the doors. I drew the blinds and the curtains, and I locked the bedroom door as I do every night. And I put the cricket bat between the sunglasses cabinet and the door. I took my prosthetic legs off. Reeva jumped onto the bed, we start chatting. The TV was on. I was texting my cousin in Port Elizabeth. At about 10 past 8:10, we were whatsApping each other. And he sent me a whole lot of pictures of cars. And eventually, after a lot of whatsApps, he phoned me. I think it was about 8:25 p.m. OSCAR: It wasn't usual for me to sleep on the left. But because of my shoulder injury, I couldn't lie on my right shoulder. So, for a couple of weeks, I had been sleeping on and off on the left-hand side. I was getting increasingly tired. I said to her, "Will you bring in the fans, "and close the curtains, and lock the doors when you fall asleep?" She said to me that she would. And then I fell asleep. The first thing we did was we interpreted the evidence, and created a CGI model. So that we could test further his story to the physical and forensic evidence. OSCAR: I woke up, my lady, in the early hours of the 14th of February. Noticed that the fans were still running and the door was still open. Although the lights had been switched off, Reeva was still awake. She rolled over to me and she said, "Can't you sleep, my baba." I got to where the fans were. I took the small fan, the floor fan, and placed it pretty much just inside the room. And I took the bigger tripod fan and I took it by the part just underneath the fan. And I placed it in the bedroom. Um... The fans were still running. I, then, drew the curtains. This bed made no creaks. There were no springs in this bed. These were one-foot-thick marble floors with a half-inch-thick brand new carpet on it in a brand new home. OSCAR: The only bits of light that was in the room was a little LED light on the amplifier. I picked the jeans up. I was gonna cover, just place them over the amplifier, over the lights. It was at this point that I heard a window open in the bathroom. What did you think at the time, Mr. Pistorius? OSCAR: I think, initially, I just froze. I didn't really know what to do. I heard this noise and interpreted as being somebody was climbing into the bathroom. And the first thing that ran through my mind was that I needed to arm myself, that I needed to... protect Reeva and I. That I needed to get my gun. Reeva, there's somebody's in the house. Call the police. Get on the floor, call the police, Reeves. Somebody in the house. Get on the floor. As I entered where the passage is, it was at that point I was just overcome with fear, and I started screaming and shouting for the burglar or the intruders to get out of my house. OSCAR: Get out! Get out of the fucking house! Get out! Reeva, call the police. Get out! Just before I got to the wall of the... where the tiles start in the bathroom, I stopped shouting because I was worried that if I shout, the person would know exactly where I was. Just before I got to the passage of the bathroom, I heard a door slam which could have only been the toilet door. OSCAR: Reeva, call the police! Get out! My eyes were going between the window and the toilet. I stood there for sometime. And then I heard a noise from inside the toilet. [REEVA SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] Before I knew it, I had fired four shots at the door. OSCAR: Reeva! Reeva, call the police! Call the police! At some point, I decided to... to walk back to the room, because I couldn't check if was a response or not. I retreated back to point where I got to the corner of the bed. I lifted myself up on to the bed, and placed my hand back. I thought if Reeva was there, I couldn't feel anything. Then, at first, it dawned upon me that it could be Reeva that was in the... in the bathroom, on the toilet. I made my way back to inside the... Inside the bathroom and I walked up to the... Up to the bathroom door. I tried to grab the handle and rip open the door. Push the door open and it was locked. I ran back to the room. Please, please. Oh, please, please. [PANTING] Please help! Please help! Please help me. Help! I screamed for somebody to help me. And then... I put my prosthetic legs on. I ran as fast as I could back to the bathroom, I ran into the door. It didn't move at all. I leant back and I tried to kick the door. Just panicked at this point. I didn't really know what to make or what to do. I ran back to the bedroom, where the cricket bat was between the cabinet and the door. I think I hit the door three times. And there was a big plank. I grabbed it with my hands, and I threw it out into the bathroom. [OSCAR SOBBING] She wasn't breathing. JADGE MASIPA: We'll take an adjournment. Court will adjourn. [OSCAR WAILING] It was like some extreme moment of pain. And I remember myself being quite shaken. The case was adjourned. The judge almost fled the courtroom, it was all just so... Awful spectacle of human suffering to confront. Johann Stander was the manager at the estate. And he went on to the scene of the crime in the immediate aftermath of the events happening after Pistorius phoned him for help. JOHAN STANDER: My lady, I received a phone call round about 0319 He said on the call, "Oom, Johan, please, please, please come to my house, please. "I shot Reeva. I thought she was an intruder." Please, please come quick. My daughter and I then decided to go to Mr. Pistorius's house as quickly as possible. My daughter was in front of me. She pushed the door open. And we saw Mr. Pistorius coming down the stairs with Reeva in his arms. CARICE VILJOEN: When he saw us, he just kept on, "Carice please. Carice please can we... "Can we just put her in the car and get her to the hospital?" He just wanted to get her to the hospital and I told him to, "No, can you please... Just put her down, "Just put her down, so that we can just see what's wrong." [CRYING] I am sorry, my lady, I apologize. Are you sure you can proceed? CARICE VILJOEN: Yes, I'm sure. Just give me a second. JOHAN STANDER: He was screaming, he was crying. He was praying. When he put his finger in her mouth, and try to keep the airway open for her to breathe. How he begged her to stay with him. I saw the truth there this morning... that morning. I saw it and I feel it. BARRY: Mr. Pistorius, I want you to look at a document. What document is that? OSCAR: The Valentine's letter and card from Reeva, It says on the front of the card, "Roses are red, "violets are blue." On the inside, she wrote, "I think today is a good day to tell you that..." And then it says, "I love you."
