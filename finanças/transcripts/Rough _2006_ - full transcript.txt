Hiroki Nakanishi heavily injured in a car accident Ami Bye bye Bye ...he be of soul who could pass by [ note: They're at English lesson ] A sight so touching in its majesty This city now doth, like a garment Ok, who wants to translate until this point? Do you want the lunch to be warmed once more? [ amulet for road safety ] Don't you come to the training? The teacher is on the rag he says you don't want to do nothing The champion can 23 00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:19,637 Keisuke Do you know what's your weak point? Try to jump We're at 10 meters It's the same height as when we dive. Hey... I think I would die... We always dive from such height That's why we get mad when we see someone like you, who retires in his shell! Shell? Yeah, the shell! Every time that something happens, you always make a face as if nothing were. and squash your feelings and close with a shell! What's up, you're suddenly serious... That's just natural! Being serious, getting angry, crying, suffering in the reality, there are such things! You have to take it all out! You're fighting for a 0.01 second!! If you don't break this shell and take things seriously, for as pathetic as it can be, you have to take it all out!! Otherwise you'll never be able to win! Don't touch me! Now I'm wicked, right? So you're skipping class again!? If you got nothing to do, then help me already By the way... That... Ogata, who lives in the same room as you did you know he will be leaving the dormitory? Announcement to all athletes... please gather in the main hall... It's not like I wanted to hide it from you. I was planning to talk to you about it after the competition. Is it because... you don't want to be emotional? Yeah It's already a long time that my father is sick. They say he doesn't have much time left to live. I got to go back home and take care of everything. Today it's the last one. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! You're Ogata and Yamato, right? Yeah... Yess!! - Can we take a picture? - Can we? Yeah... Great!! Please come here! Please! I'm going! Smile! Smile, Keisuke Ok, cheese! Ogata he . . . . I was very proud... even though I said those things to you last time, to tell you the truth, when I wrote letters to my family, I always wrote about you. I said that you have a great talent. This is the final dive for the competition Perhaps, I'll never get a chance to be as excited as today. As time goes by... I may also forget the way of diving. But... I got the feeling... that certainly i will certainly miss this place Keisuke I'm... very proud of you. Do you want to dive? From here? How can I dive for good? Teach me It's impossible! Teach me! It's not so easy! Come on, teach me. I said it's impossible! You'll get hurt! I want to win not over somebody else I...... want to win against what I was "one second" ago. Am I the only one... who remembers about this? Keisuke, hurry up and fetch it back! A long time ago... "She" made me cry all the time. I couldn't even swim and she made me swim to see who arrives first to the other side... she always told me to dive from high... all the time, pushing me. But... at some point, for some reason I couldn't meet her anymore ...so I cried again. Me... the hospital... on that day... if only... if only I didn't phone him... brother... that injury... It's all my fault..... NEXT SUMMER I'LL BREAK NAKANISHI'S RECORD!! I'll break it, got it?! I'll break it no matter what!! kaisatsu no mae tsunagu te to te (at the subway entrance, hand in the hand) itsumo no zawameki, atarashii kaze (the usual noise, a new wind) akaruku miokuru hazu datta noni (I thought I would see you of with a smile) umaku waraezu ni (instead, I couldn't laugh for good) kimi wo mite ita (and just stayed staring at you) kimi ga otona ni natteku sono kisetsu ga (at the time you'll grow up) kanashii uta de afurenai you ni (I don't want sad songs to overflow you) saigo ni nanika kimi ni tsutaetakute (there's something I want to tell you, now that we're at the end) "sayonara" ni kawaru kotoba wo (I tried to use different words) boku wa sagashiteta (for not saying "goodbye") totsuzen fui ni narihibiku beru no oto (the sound of a bell that echoes so suddenly) aseru boku tokeru te hanareteku kimi (I'm in a bind [*impatient], our hands untie, you leave) muchuu de yobitomete dakishimeta nda (I called your name to stop you, and then hug you) kimi ga doko ni ittatte boku no koe de mamoru yo (everywhere you'll go, I'll protect you with my voice) Ah... it's snowing!

Oh Hello, I'm Yamato. You have to come and see tomorrow there's the student championship. Uwaaaa! Brother!!! The athlete in the fourth course Nakanishi, from Sokai University with 49 seconds and 68--- This sets a new Japan record I put all myself into it That accident... wasn't Ami's fault. "Don't think about it anymore" I came back to tell her these words. So--- I can't absolutely lose. This time--- I want to be the one... to save Ninomiya from drowning. That's all. It was worth to wait for one year. Do you really quit? I couldn't even train for one whole year... So you quit... without mastering the twist dive. We can just say bye bye if it's her will to quit. There are two things I'm sure about that I trained a lot and that in the meanwhile I never stopped watching you Always... we were always the last two to remain in this pool. The reason why I could keep on training hard was you. I like you. The supporter's bus is about to leave! Come on, hurry up! Ninomiya... recently... you've got always the same expression. What expression? A sad expression. ...We finally arrived to the last year. These three years seemed long, but were short Many things happend I...... I've been watching you all the time. And you certainly swimmed. You kept on swimming. So that's the only thing I can say: that your effort wasn't in vain. Certainly, it will help your back to grow bigger. Got it? GO WITH ALL YOUR STRENGH! Yeeeeeah! Alright, do your best! Don't you dive? If you want to, do it quickly. I haven't done it for a long time... so I'm a little afraid. So you can't dive, huh? Because your heart is confused, Thats why you cannot dive. Confused? No, really, I'm not... So what are you doing here? You don't have time left. The competition is about to start Those two . . . had already made up their minds. They've decided that today will be the day But you... what are you doing!? This is not the place... to escape from reality, right? It's not like... I can't decide. I...... when I look to oniichan, I think he's so fantastic. So why don't you go to support him!? Why don't you go!? To support your brother! After all you love him, right!? Yes! I love him so much! My big brother... has always been... since always... since I was this little... has always been there for me. Always with me... we went out together we talked all the time He always protected me... gave me many good advices... it's on him that... I could always count on... that I'm proud of... that I love so much... I . . . . I will go. Then... let's dive together. Oniichan! Ninomiya? Yes, and she told me to give it to you. Do you want to know... what did she tell me that time? No thanks. It's not something worth knowing, anyway. I don't believe that you, Nakanishi, could ever tell me... something that may distract me before the race. Huh? How odd... Come on... Huh? And the race? Don't you go to see? Do you have some other thing to do? A heart-break. That's what it was. Well, it's going to be all right. Dumped or be dumped, summer will come around again. So I'm going to save Ami. OK. Ready Ah... Ahhh... Can you hear me? I'm Ami Ninomiya. can you hear me? Today is friday, august 25 9.25 am ...and 31 seconds... 32... 33... 34... 35 The temperature is 28 degrees Sky is sunny, light breeze. Ah... can you hear me? I love you. Ami Ninomiya over and out 1 Keisuke Yamato Keisuke Yamato Answer me ### FINALE SONG I've been phisically good, these days, but... my heart beats fast, I don't know why under this burning sun I suddenly feel such high tension! I got the nerve now, so... the distances will vanish at will! I want to kiss those lips I get closer to the target ant take it at once! "the important is to put words in action" ..and to avoid as much as possible troubles! but actualy things don't go like that but I decided, you go first! always in the essential moment that whimp starts crying loud doesn't make a step out you're pathetic! what are you doing!? "I don't care" "and anyway it's no use"! but before deciding on your own you should know that it doesn't matter how you look! don't stop your feelings you can't decide yourself anything you do and you're always saying spiteful things! so what do you really want!? if you're always so halfhearted, you'll never get... the victory! how many times did you fall in love!? nevermind that and go straight forward don't try to change this passive character of yours, but quit it for good! behind every success there's the shadow of the anxiety yesterday and today it was rainy, so tomorrow it's gonna be sunny! it's no use to be so half hearted I understand it rationally it's not necessary to think only about the result don't cloud off your will! on the line that prolongs a complete love there's an eden full of hope and glory you have to change the ideal you always aimed to into reality don't be afraid! engine to max power! so what's the most important thing? you gotta ask to the botom of your heart if you try to make one step outside this is your moment, shout! make your love explose to the climax it will pop in yur heart! don't worry anymore about how you look! don't stop your feelings! don't lose your feelings! ### FINALE SONG Mom! Mom, look, look at me! This uniform fits you better than anybody else! You got the same face as I did when I was young! Bye bye! By~~e! Be a good girl! OK! - Hi! - Good morning! Takayuki! Your necktie... It's not straight... do something! - 'morning - hi - Bye - See you later It's late, hurry up!
