HANUMA by A. Tsagareli Produced by Georgy Tovstonogov Part one As soon as I close my eyes - you rise before me. As soon as open my eyes - your image clouds my sight. Oh, my queen! Till I die, I'm your poor slave. Even if you kill me, my star, I'm still your poor captive. You walk - I follow you, I am your poor captive. You look - I'm behind you, I am your poor captive. What's the use in laughing at me? I am your poor captive! I whisper to myself: "How am I not good enough?" As soon as I close my eyes - you rise before me. As soon as I open my eyes - your image clouds my sight. The house of Prince Pantiashvili I didn't sleep all night because of him! Oh God Almighty! Do you know where is this godless creature at? Every night I wait for him till morning, and from morning till night. What is this, is that called a brother? I've given up my life for him. Never married because of him. What gratitude do I get? Nothing! I don't even see him, just his creditors. Got drunk in a duhan? Pay up. Visited a sauna? Pay up. Pay up, pay up... Where do we get the money for that? I've sold my last ring already. Only one bracelet is left, a gift from my grandmother. Where's the bracelet? Oh, just you wait! I'll get you, you godless man! That's our servant, Timote. Why are you lying around? Where's the Prince? Where were you all night? - Answer! - Where? Ah, first at Prince Kipiani's wake. - Then? - Then at Prince Vardiani's christenings. Then, at a restaurant. Then? Then, in a duhan. And then they drove off to Ortachala and I went back home. I'm not a Prince, I do need to work. He left his own master! My brother! Our Prince! You should be carrying him in your arms all day for the salary you get! I am! I carried him in my arms from Prince Kipiani to Prince Vardiani. - Where is he? - For free, by the way. - Pay up, pay up... - Your dear brother, our master, hasn't paid me a dime in six months. "Hasn't paid!" - Yes, for six months. - "Hasn't paid!" He'll get married and pay off all the debts! He'll pay you too. The best matchmaker, Hanuma! Found him a bride - Guliko Mohnadze. They've sent the dowry list already, the showing will be today. Do you know what IS Hanuma? - I know. - She had married half of Tiflis! The other half is queueing up to be next. You know, she'll be here soon, but the groom is gone. Go look for the Prince around all duhans! Go look for the Prince around all duhans! Go look for the Prince... There are more duhans than Princes here. Oh Lord, why did you punish us! Go, run like a chamois! Fly like an eagle! Don't chug water like a donkey! Go look for the Prince around all duhans! Here, your brother has arrived. Not alone, with his nephew. - Is that our Kote? - Yes, in a phaeton with musicians. - Oh, where did he get the money from? - Probably pawned his watch. - Watch? - Yes. - The family heirloom? - The family heirloom. The gold one. What happened? Help! Eh, as usual: carry him, drag him. Careful, very careful. - Is he alive? - Alive. Alive. He's very drunk, as you see. Oh why did the Lord send me such a brother! Lost all his wealth! Partied his late brother's estate away! Left his nephew without bread or land! I've only got one nice dress left. - Greetings, dear. - Greetings, auntie Tekle. Kote, dear, where did you find him? Where did I- I was on my way to my student, when I saw a jolly company crawling out from a duhan, everyone in a predictable state, off to another duhan. And my uncle? He crawled out, and gave up there. I get a phaeton, he gets five more phaetons for all his fellows! With the musicians? Oh, of course! I pay my last three abaz and off we go. Water! Give him water! - Water. - Get better. - He's drinking. - Drinking. I want to drink for the eternal peace of my dearest Prince Vardiani. Let him rest in peace, and I will always remain your godfather. Godfather? To a deceased? I told you, first we had the wake, then the christenings. Christenings? Cross yourself, brother! You are at home! I can see that! Instead of wine, I get water. Of course, you need to pay for the wine! Money, money, money... What is money? Money is water! Looks like a good toast is coming up: "Let's drink to the eternal source of the soul that allows..." Uncle, if they ever paid for toasts in Georgia, you would've been the richest man alive. But currently I've wasted all my month's salary on a phaeton and on these musicians of yours! Salary? Do you work? I have to, uncle, I give lessons, teach music, good manners. You heard that, Tekle? Prince Pantiashvili Junior is working! Thanks to you, uncle. Nobody had ever worked in our family. - Your grandfather served Alexander- - The Second. That's right. - Your uncle served Alexander- - The Third. Served! Not worked. Do you know what the pride of a Prince is? You cannot buy that with money. Do you have ten more abaz, by the way? I need to buy my watch out. That's strange, uncle, strange. Do you have anything, sister? You better tell me where my bracelet has gone! Let's not bring that up. And you, Timote? - There he is. - Where? Where? That's insolence. I'll pay you back, a Prince's word. Leave your moustache alone. Did you forget our old tradition or what? If a Prince gives his word with a stache, that's more reliable than any receipt! Your debts are growing faster than your stache, Your Excellence. Oh, just you wait! Just you wait! I'll get married, pay off all my debts, And go far away from all of you, to Petersburg. Petersburg, Petersburg! C'est magnifique, as the French say. You'll waste all the money again. And what are you going to do when you come back? I'll marry again! I don't like to save up, I like to drink up! If your soul gets bleak - drown it in wine. All my friends, my dear Princes, will be invited to my wedding. Drink all you can! My Prince status is also a sellable good, mind you! Strong feelings must go with money, otherwise - au revoir. I need a smart wife to be my friend, I need her to speak in French with me. Instead of khash and lavash - turtle soup for lunch! Tricks a la fourchette for all guests and strangers! Goodbye. - Uncle and aunt, goodbye. - Goodbye, dear. Let the Lord grant you the prettiest, richest, smartest wife! - Goodbye! - Thank you, dear. The smartest one will never marry him. Be quiet, scoundrel! Anyone would marry me. - Princes do not just lie around on the streets. - Really? They very much do. Saw that myself. What happened? What's going on? - Hanuma! Let's go, dear, change our clothes. - Let's go. I'll help you. He's sitting about again, the lazybone! Go meet a dear guest! Bring her in! Sit her down! Help me, Timote! I can't get up, help! A smart wife... "Hanuma!" "Hanuma!" I am Kabato. Also a matchmaker, by the way. Not a bad one either! "Hanuma, Hanuma!" I'll show that Hanuma today! How many times has she crossed my path! Changed a groom's mind, or trashed him in front of his bride! I'll laugh at her today! Everyone will say, "Good job, Kabato! Outplayed Hanuma!" I'll steal all her clients, I will have money, respect and prestige. What will I have, then? Timote, dear, good day! What will you have? The commission! Here, take it. Ten abaz. Thirty after the wedding. Go get the Prince. You're pretty late. The best matchmaker, Hanuma, has already found us a bride. Hanuma! If I marry your Prince to my bride, who knows who will be The Hanuma out of us two! Listen, why are standing around? Go get the Prince. "Hanuma"! A matchmaker for you! The matchmaker is here. Hanuma! Kabato? Why are you here? Hanuma already found us a bride - - Guliko Mohnadze. They've sent the dowry list already. - Wait, Prince! Look what bride I have found for you: slim like a poplar, soft like a peach, I won't take a dime from you! We can't. We have the showing today. "Showing today"! Show what, mistress? What? What do you mean, "what"? "Show what?" Sister, read out the dowry list to this insolent woman. - Diamond rings - five, - Five! - Fat-tailed sheep: - Twenty! - Twenty five. - Tekin rugs: - Forgot. - Twelve. - Osetin horses - fifteen. - Even more! Why are you shouting? You really believe that cheeky Hanuma? Rugs destroyed by moths, sheep turned into cloths, diamonds - phony, horses - baloney. And the bride? Three grooms have escaped from the showing, the fourth one stayed. - He couldn't run. - Why? Died. Look at my bride! Lips like dogwood, skin like a peach, eyes like olives! What are you going about fruit and veg? What's that bride's dowry? Speak up. A whole day won't be enough to finish the list. Her father's only daughter, he'll do anything for her! No wonder: lips like dogwood, skin like a peach, eyes like... I've heard that. Who's the father of this peach? Speak up. An Avlabarian merchant made you an honour. Big honour for sure! Some merchant, from Avlabar to top it off. Where do YOU live? Not in Avlabar? - Temporarily. - Why are you saying that, Prince? Why? What is Tiflis without Avlabar? The jolliest kinto are in Avlabar. The most skilled masters are in Avlabar. The richest brides are in Avlabar. There's a mountain by a lake, by the mountain flows Kura, behind Kura, a noisy bazaar, behind the bazaar, there stands Avlabar. Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! The wisest of the wisest are here, the richest of all merchants are here, every merchant has a daughter at home! All brunettes, all playful, all beautiful, all - for you. All brunettes, all playful, - All beautiful, all - for you. - All for me! - No, I don't believe you, matchmaker. - You don't? - No. - Should I tell him who would his father-in-law be? - C'mon. Mikich Kotryants! Mikich Kotryants? You're crazy, woman! Let my hands fall off, my eyes go blind, my teeth fall out and one left to ache! Stop, woman! A leather factory in Tiflis, footwear stores in Gori, Kutaisi, Manglisi - all his! Also I'll say that today at ten o'clock Mikich himself will visit you with his steward and his own dowry list. At ten? What time is it now? In the duhan where you left your watch? Five to one. Be quiet! - Quiet! - What are we going to say to Hanuma? She will obliterate us! Clarify that to me please, who is the Prince here? You or Hanuma, maybe? Who's the Prince? Me or Hanuma? A richer bride and a cheaper matchmaker! - Timote! - I'm here, here. If Hanuma arrives, I'm not home. And bring Kotryants straight inside the house. What house? There's one seat left. We'll receive them in the garden then. Tell them we're having repairs. - Hanuma won't find us there! - She won't! What food do we have for them? Not a breadcrumb in the house. French style! Timote! - I'm here. - Remember that? I do, like we did with Prince Kipiani - feed them with dish names only. Get some wine from Adamyan. - They won't give me anything there anymore. - Then from Grigoryan. - They'll give there alright. - Well, why are you still here? C'mon, run... They'll break my neck if I show up there again! Stop talking, drumhead, run, I said! Watch out, Hanuma! All poets and kinto Will praise Kabato in their verses! That schemer Hanuma won't even be a servant when this ends! Everybody will present me gifts, shower me with compliments, I will be the leading matchmaker! Wrap up, Hanuma! His very garden How should I announce you to the Prince? Announce what? Eh, tell him who's there. Why did you come? Your title? Say it's Kotryants the merchant, came without a title, but with a steward. The Prince will meet you here in the garden, with the steward. Hey, listen, why meet us in the garden? Are we selling matsoni or something? That's how Princes do stuff. We're having repairs here. The Prince and the architect are thinking about whether they should coat the ceiling with gold or silver. A gold ceiling! You can see that's a Prince. Ceiling in gold - wallet in mold. - Debt drinking, debt sewing, debt living. - Akop! I've bought out all his bonds so nobody will think that the Prince marries Sona to pay off his debts. I need his title! - His coat of arms! - And why do you need that? My grandfather was a cobbler, he would make seven pairs of boots for three abaz! Father made thread with his teeth, repaired chyuvyaks as a water-boy! And I will be Prince Pantiashvili's father-in-law! I'll be driving around in a coated carriage, servants at the front, coat of arms - at the back! You know merchant Adamyan who sells leather? His daughter married Prince Gogidze's second cousin! So now Adamyan doesn't recognise me anymore! Doesn't shake hands! Doesn't sell leather to me! Imagine his reaction now! From now on, I can slap my coat of arms everywhere. On rugs, tupperware - a coat of arms of my own! Sign bonds and loans, send letters all on stamped paper! A coat of arms above my shop! On my servants at the door. With a coat of arms I will go to saunas and duhans. Let Adamyan explode with envy! And your daughter? Don't you feel sorry for Sona? Is that a groom for her? Sixteen and sixty? Even an old rooster can make great satsivi, as long as the spices are good. Here the spices are finger-licking! My daughter Sona will become a Duchess, drive around in a coated carriage, servants at the front, coat of arms - at the back. Why does he need a coat of arms? Can't eat it, can't drink it, can't even sprinkle it into lobio for flavour. Akop! You'll read out the dowry list loudly, with expression. I'd do that myself, but I can't read. Why should you? A merchant should be counting. His Excellence, Prince Vano Pantiashvili. What did he say? Something about an abat-jour. You'll have one, Prince, dear! You'll have a crystal lamp! - What'd he say? - A boor or something. He said "Hi". Ah! Should've said that straight away. Good day, dear Prince. Good day, Your... - What? - "Have a seat", he said. Ah, should've just said that. Such long words and what a short meaning. Read out the dowry list, Akop, loudly. I'd do that myself, but I left my glasses at home. Why? Why hurry, my dear? Do it later. I wanted to say... Your Excellence, a bird! Right, so... - Take it away. - Away? Timote, find out what's on the menu from the cook. I did. First - turtle soup from Paris, second - mussels from Marseille... And the wine? What wine will it be? - Bordeaux! - From where? From Bordeaux. Bring it in. Well, where's the soup? The ship is late in Batumi. And the mussels? The cook says you can only serve mussels after the soup. - And Bordeaux? - There are six crates of champagne in front of it, can't reach it. Oh, you scoundrel! Shaming me in front of my guests, "can't reach it"! Just you wait, I'll get you! Don't be angry, Prince, who cares about some Boordos! We've brought six hundred barrels of Gaedin wine for you. - Where is it? - Here! Read the list, Akop! Money given for our bride - - Two thousand! - A shop in Dugomi, a shop in Manglis, beddies, horsies, blankies, sheepies ringlets - I won't read all that. - Why? - Take as much as you want! For the couple: a stone house on the bank of Kura, with a wine cellar. Want a swim? Here's your house, there's Kura. Want a bath? Here's your house, there's Kura. Want a drink? Here's your house, there's Kura. Excuse me! What if there's a flood? Oh c'mon, where's your house and where's Kura? Tell the most important thing about the bride! - No words for her. - Excuse me?! Eyes go blind from her beauty, minds go crazy from her mindfulness, - she talks as she writes and writes as she talks. - Even in French? Of course. When I served Alexander III, everybody spoke French to each other. Not only in the palace, but on the street as well. Don't worry, Prince, Sona speaks, sings and eats only in French! - Sleeps, too. - When she eats chicken, the entire house gathers to take a look: she holds it with one knife and cuts with another, pours sauce with a spoon and serves with a fork. - We hired a teacher just for that, thanks to him, she knows it all. - It all! Deal? Your Excellence! No! Now he's not Your Excellence. He's Our Excellence. I wish your honour to live a hundred more happy years! Live with your young wife, for a hundred happy years! With such a rich father-in-law, I can get back my estates! And pawn them again. Freedom is the most important thing in life, don't be a slave to your wife. I'd give all the riches away to not become a slave to a wife. I'd give my freedom away, if the Prince pays me for the past six months. Everybody wants to live like in heaven! Everybody is looking for something to gain! Make a good purchase, make a good sale! Grab more and give less! In shops and bazaars, will gather all the trade folks. Admire the couple, will all the trade folks. All the merchants now will give me everything for free, without breaking my neck. I will have a watch again, like all respectable Princes! I will have a moustache again, like all respectable Princes! Eh no, enjoy marriage without me. I will be free like an eagle in the sky! Everybody wants to live like in heaven! Everybody is looking for something to gain! Make a good sale, make a good purchase! Grab more and give less! Prince, dear, I'm going to the mountains for some urgent business, let's not waste time! The showing will be today, the wedding - tomorrow! That's my steward Akop, I trust him. He will show you the bride. Come early. - Why? - To dine. I will. Dear... What is this? I'll come for sure. Au revoir. "Au revoir" means... What'd he say?! Means "get me a proper feast". Enough to eat and even more to drink. Now it's the opposite, such a short word has such a wide meaning. Read aloud, sister. - Two thousand abaz? Is that a deal? - Of course it is! Read it! - A shop in Degomi, a shop in Manglis! - What did I say! A stone house at the bank of Kura with a wine cellar. Who'd find you such a bride for free? Two hundred abaz from you. - You said you won't take a dime! - "You said"! Who knows what I said! I'll pay you after the wedding, I have no money now. I haven't eaten since yesterday's wake. I'll die and never get to see my bride! Timote, grab a basket and go to the bazaar. We need to celebrate this. - With no money again? I won't go. - What do you mean? I know what'll happen. Nothing will happen, let's go. Let's see what happens now. - Are you happy, sister? - I am! I sure am, but I'm very afraid of Hanuma still. - How so? - That's not a woman, that's a shaitan in a dress. Drinks without snacking, sniffs tobacco, her hand is heavy. So what? What is Hanuma to me? Remember what she did to Prince Ciceshvili? What did she do to Prince Ciceshvili? He couldn't marry at all after that. Ah, whatever. If Hanuma comes, just tell her that the Prince went to his manor. Manor?! A manor has to exist in the first place, who are you trying to fool? Fine, then tell her... Since the dawn of times, there hasn't been a better matchmaker in the world. All day deep in my work, I let the human race carry on. A Prince or a merchant, a bachelor or a widower, even if you're over a century old, I'll marry you all, no problem! Drinking alone is a sin! Being a bachelor is a sin! Without a friend, without a wife, living like this is a sin! Good day, Prince! Good day, dear! I'm glad to see you and your sister in good health, and your house in good wealth. Bless you, Hanuma. Are you worrying about my health? Thank you, Duchess. - Oh, Prince, I saw such a dream today! - What dream? As if you're being driven in a black hearse around Avlabar, with black horses dressed in black, you're in black, only your spats are white. - What does it mean? - Indeed! Ah, who knows! It means a wedding, dear! Take a seat, Hanuma. Thank you, only a matchmaker's feet can feed her, your beautiful bride Guliko and I have run around all shops today. Bought everything for the wedding. The showing is today, remember? Your beauty, your bride Guliko is awaiting you for dinner today. I can't do it today, Hanuma, I have a headache. Let's do it tomorrow. A headache! That's nothing, dear, take a look at the dowry and you'll get well straight away. Ringlets, sheepies, horsies, and the bride is not that old. Well, hard to say. - Just forty years old. - Wait, you said thirty-five? Ah, dear, there's always forty when there's thirty-five. Are we at the bazaar or something, why bargain over such a trifle? Here, sign the marriage contract. Oh, you can sign anything on paper, do you think I don't know? Sheep are all cloths, rugs eaten by moths, horses - baloney, diamonds - all phony. Ah, so this is where it's all coming from! That's why Kabato flickered past your house, these are her words! - Did she teach you that? - I'm a Prince, I make my own decisions! - I don't want to marry your bride, period. - He doesn't! He doesn't! Does he want to defame me in front of the entire town? Does he want to shame my beauty, my bride Guliko? Poor girl! - Fifty years has she waited for this day! - Fif- what?! Fifty already? Oh, YOU will settle even for something like this! You will stand on your knees. You will beg me! I'll rip that damned Kabato's hair out! Yours too. - And you, say thanks... - Thanks. - ...for being bald. - What?! What to do, sister? What to do? Which showing should I attend? - If you don't visit Guliko, Hanuma will obliterate you. - Obliterate me. And if you don't visit Sona, how are we going to pay off our debts? What should I choose? What? Guliko waits me for dinner, Mikitch - for lunch. Ah, fine. As the French say: "From two sorrows to munch, I choose the lunch". Bazaar Who wants some greens? Drink some wine and you'll be fine! Drink some wine and you'll be fine! Antonov apples for five kopecks! Matsoni. Got water if you need it! Matsoni. - Got water if you need it! - Got carp too! Look at this handsome boy! Wah, look who's here! Akop Gurgenovich himself! Come here, dear! Come here. Look at this ram! He was running around just this morning. Imagine the barbecue! - You'll swallow your tongue! - It's too fat. Too fat, I have an ulcer. Akop-djan, just have a try and all your ulcers will be gone. I'd eat it myself, but I need money! Akop-djan, try my wine! Not even Vorontsov-Dashkov the governor had tried anything like this! He hadn't because your wine is like vinegar! I will take the ram, and the wine! Today we will have to feed all of Avlabar. What happened, dear Akop-djan? Mikich Kotryants marries his daughter off. All of Avlabar is invited! There's a mountain by a lake, by the mountain flows Kura, behind Kura - a noisy bazaar after the bazaar - there stands Avlabar. Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! Congratulations, colleague! Take everything for free. Just tell your master who you took it from. Akop-djan, when are you going to get married? I told you, I have an ulcer. Why do I need a second one? How much is the turkey, master? You want a turkey? Pay for the chicken first! What chicken? The one you took on credit! Oy fear the Lord, what chicken? That was a pure sparrow. When your butt-naked Prince finally pays the debt off, that sparrow will turn into a ram, just like yourself. Hey, how much is the melon, master? You want a melon? - I do. - Want a rotten eggplant instead? What are you saying?! Listen, get lost before I smash my melon on your rotten watermelon. And you said everything would be different! That's nothing, they'll change their tune soon. Hey, Akop! Remind me please, who is it that your Sona marries? His Prince, Vano Pantiashvili. Why didn't you say before? She marries your Prince, Vano Pantiashvili! So what if it's a Prince? Sona had a Russian general wooing her. So why didn't she marry that Russian general? A military secret. Kabato, was it you who matchmaked Sona then? What a matchmaker! What a great job! After you! Drink up! All for free! Here you are, you lowlife! Went to the bazaar, straight to brag! Look at her, people! She matchmaked a young, beautiful and a rich one! Can you match like I do? An ageing, ugly and not a rich one? Who is it you decided to cross? Whose clients have you decided to steal? I'll smash your sides in! I'll make chahohbili out of her! You won't be even admitted to the hospital! You're a thief, you're a scoundrel! Forever will you burn in hell! Don't you sweat or swear this much, I'll go straight to heaven! Let you be a wife to a plagued, bald, limp and ugly hippo! Then let you not be accepted even by a hunched freckled bimbo! Help! Break them apart! Do something! When women are fighting, you better stay away. No! There's no one in this world who can shut me up! No one to dare argue with Hanuma herself! A policeman! You're a thief, you're a bum, What do you want from me? Don't even dream of Kotryants' daughter, You lowlifes! You can congratulate the Prince and Sona on the marriage tomorrow! There will be no wedding! You hear that, people? Hanuma herself gives her word! Help! Break them apart! Do something! When women are fighting, you better stay away. No! There's no one in this world who can shut me up! No one to dare argue with Hanuma herself! When women are fighting you better stay away. No, there's no one in this world who can shut her up! No one to dare argue with Hanuma herself! The house of Mikich Kotryants Sleep, granny, sleep, sleep, my dear, oh please sleep. Oh, Kote! Listen, Kote, I must confess... ~...the sky is fading, the sun will peek from the darkness...~ Oh, Kote, I must confess... What's going on? Listen, Kote Luarsabovich, let's move on to declamation now. Move on to what?! Declamation, granny. That's reading aloud, with expression. What's all this? Grandma Anoush, you'd better go to your room, - or you'll get a headache here and... - Wah! I'm used to expressions. When Mikich settles accounts with his stewards, there are such declamations going on sometimes! - Go on. - As you wish, of course... Sona, we will read a dramatic dialogue. I will be the young Count, and you will be his cousin. Countess, yesterday I've been wandering around the gardens, among marble cold statues. When suddenly, I found a quiet gazebo, overgrown with ivy and grapes. Countess, what do you want to tell me? Oh, Count, I've been wandering around Montmartre, - when suddenly, in a bookshop... - Wah! Why do you talk in such a horrible voice? That's how it's meant to be, granny. I've warned you. - That's how it is? - Yes. Well, continue. I've found Ovidyi's sonnets that you used to read to me. The matchmaker came in yesterday, they want to marry me off. What is this?! Does it actually say that there? Yes, granny: "Said the Countess in French". Ah, in French... Fine, continue. Inside that small quiet gazebo, only one thought kept torturing me: what will happen to me? I don't know. Father will never allow me to marry a poor teacher. Wait, wait, wait... Who is he? A teacher or a Count? Why is he a Count if he's poor? And if he's a teacher, why is he a Count? I don't know, granny. That's what it says here. What is this? "The Count said..." Give me the book. Here, please. You too. I don't like this declamation. Practice some dancing instead. - Dancing? - Yes. - At this time? - At what time? - At what time?! - Fine, dancing it is. Please. What is this?! Granny Anoush, I beg you, please relocate to somewhere far from here, - otherwise we won't have enough space for dancing. - Wah! During Sona's christenings we had a hundred people dancing bagdaduri here! We won't be dancing bagdaduri! We'll be waltzing. This dance requires space! And Mikich requires me to keep a close eye on Sona. All right. Waltz! Waltz was born in Vienna, and now all of Europe dances it. What's all this?! What's all this commotion?! Figure number one: the lady puts her hand on her partner's shoulder. Well, please. The partner embraces the lady's waist gently. - What are you doing, rascal! Release her at once! - Granny! Practice these figures on MY figure! - But granny! - What, "granny"? Mikich told me not to let a single man near you. But I'm not a man. I'm a teacher! - Wah! A teacher! - He is a teacher! Get married and then do any figures you want. And now look and learn. Come here, teacher. C'mon. Grab my waist. Wah! What are you searching for there? Apologies, but you don't have a waist. - No waist, you see! - No waist?! Then grab whatever's there. Dance to the rhythm, relax your feet, first like this, then like that. A bit slower, I beg you. Now, figure number five. Try breathing slower. I'm barely breathing as it is. Now figure number seven, anyone can master it. Seven, eight - I don't care. A pirouette after pirouette, the higher society lights up when waltz is on. What lights? My vision's getting dark. Where's my beauty? - Well, daughter, are you dancing? - Wah! The dances are over. Your legs will start dancing on their own from happiness! Sona, do you know what kind of groom have we found for you? Adamyan's daughter will be biting her nails! Akop, tell her. As handsome as a narcissus, as slim as a cypress, that is if I'm standing on one side of Kura, he's on the opposite side, and there's fog between us. Wha-?! - Well, if you look closer, there are some little defects, of course. - What defects? The legs are bit crooked, the teeth are a bit implanted, but that's nothing. - Everything can be fixed. - Silence! - Tell her the main thing, is he a Prince? - A Prince. Hear that, Sona, a real Prince! Sona! His Excellence, Prince Vano Pantiashvili! What's up with her? - From happiness, probably. - Yes? And what about you? My legs went numb, from happiness probably. Can you repeat his name please? Perhaps I've mist- He's called Prince Vano Pantiashvili. Mama! I couldn't believe myself! Such a man has agreed! The showing is today, the wedding - tomorrow. Mikich was a simple cobbler. But he's achieved a lot since then. I'll throw a wedding for all of Tiflis! Everybody is welcome at Mikich's house. Mama, I'm going to the mountains for some urgent business, be back only tomorrow. Receive the Prince French style. Also you, teacher! Teacher, focus on French. The Prince's first condition: everything must be in French. Mama, I'm off. If only I knew... Oh, if only I knew! I would have never pulled him out from the mud. - Never! - Who? Your fiance, my uncle. - Uncle? - Uncle. - Wait, are you a Prince too? - "Too". Except one of us went from mud to princes, and another one - from princes, into mud. Why do you say that? I don't need any titles or manors from you. I love you for who you are, and I am ready to follow you to the edge of the world. My dear, does it mean that you agree? I have ages ago, Kote. Sona... Today is the happiest day of my life. So what if I'm poor, we will work. Work is the most beautiful dowry that life can give us. I will work! I will be giving lessons. Uh-huh! Not to young ladies. Sona! Tonight at dawn, I will arrive on a horse and kidnap you. We will marry in secret in an old monastery. That's so beautiful, Kote. Then we will hop on the horse and go, do you know where? - Where? - Do you know where? Where?! Nowhere. We'll go nowhere. In order to kidnap you, I need to kidnap a horse first. The ray of sun in the clear skies, was suddenly blocked by clouds. We are always a trifle away from being happy. How to be and what to do? People haven't thought of an answer. If there is love - there is no money, there is money, but no love. Without love, the world is a dawn without sun, a fire without flames, a djigit without a horse! Without love, the world is a dawn without sun, a fire without flames, a djgit without a horse! I'm telling you, Hanuma, we don't need a matchmaker, we've matched Sona already. The showing is today. - The showing! Here I am for the showing. - Here, look, then. I want to take a look at the bride. My beauty, was born before my eyes, raised with my hands. Listen, that's not her. Why are you lying to me? She should be ugly, crooked, limping. Who told you this? How else? Why would this gentle little lamb need that old dying donkey? No! That's not her. Goodbye. - Wait! - What? I don't want to marry the old Prince! - Oh, look at that! She doesn't! - What are you saying? How could you? - Your father gave his word to the Prince already! - His word. - Ordered a coat of arms. - Ordered. Easy, easy, my little chicks. Look here, don't even think of intervening, Hanuma, I know what you're up to. She grew up before your eyes, you say? Bloomed in your arms? Now what do you want? For the flower to die? I need this Prince just as much as a cow needs a papakha, as much as a donkey needs a beshmet, but I gave my word to Mikich and I'm his steward. Whatever the master says, I do. Look, steward, what did he order you to do? The showing, he ordered to do. The Prince will arrive soon to take a look at the bride. The showing! You'll have a showing. Go, my sweetie, I will dress you up myself, powder you myself, - and put the perfume on myself. - Kabato must be doing this, she's the matchmaker. Look, where is this idler? Oh, why are you cursing a woman for nothing, maybe there's been an accident or something? - What accident? - An accident! She'd fallen ill, or got beaten up at the bazaar by someone. I'll do everything for her. We are colleagues, we should help each other. Alright, "colleague!". Fine, go then. - Well, your business is bad, teacher, very bad. - Very bad. Where are you going? Wherever. I can't look at how my favorite student is being sold off for a title. You don't even need to look, go help to set up the table French style. And when your favorite student gets invited to sing, I'll call you up to acompanivise... - Accompanire... - What? Play that thing! Accompany! - Akop, where's Sona? - Over there dressing up. The Prince is here! - Grandma, have you set up the table French style? - I'm setting it up. Sona, are you ready? Please, Your Excellence. - Where's the bride? - Getting changed. She's been changing dresses since this morning: doesn't like this one, doesn't like that one. She wants to impress you. - Hope you die, old donkey. - How wonder- - What? - What? Mhmm? Funky. You funky, Your Excellence. - How old is she? - Sixteen. Ripe like a peach, white like a swan. You'll see her and drop dead. - Drop your dentures too. - How wo- Huh? - What did you j- - Say? I said, wrenches. Wrenches are the ones who don't want to marry such an eagle. Ugh, you ugly face. - What did you say? - Grace. - What grace? - The bride is a grace. - What is taking so long? Where is she? - No need to hurry, Prince, never hurry anywhere in your life. By foot or in a carriage, since day one, everyone hurries from this world, to that one. Rich, poor, widowed, married - all the same, At the end, we will all meet at one gate. Our life is as short as a spring day. Two steps away from christenings to a wake. Why hurry your life for no reason at all? Better drink chacha calmly and quietly. So don't you ever hurry. Still, hurry up the bride, dear. My heart is about to stop from the nerves. Sona! Are you ready? I'm picking a dress! There she is! I'm so glad to see you. Always glad to see you! Quiet. Well, I am pleasantly surprised! From my matchmaker's stories, I imagined you a graying elderly man. What a surprise! So young, and already a Prince! I'm not a Prince, here's the Prince. Why are you standing, gentlemen? Have a seat. Timote, I think she's... Please. Right, do you know Akop? That's our steward and a distant relative. Are you numb? Akop, do you want Sona to be happy? I do! Then bring me closer to the Prince, I want to take a proper look. What's up with him? - Just as you said, he'd see the bride and drop dead. - What happened, Prince? - Nothing, it's just a bit hot. - True, it hadn't been this hot since 1713. - What year? - 613. How can I entertain you? Oh, I know! Do you like romance? Right, he does. Akop, call my teacher in. Teacher! Kote? What are you doing here? - Uncle, your bride is mine. - What? - A student of mine. - Ah, I see. My favorite student. I taught her music, dance, good manners. I gave her all my heart, all my soul. But she... What's wrong? Don't you recognise me or what? You don't? Great! As soon as a lady puts on a nice dress and gets her hair done, she's unrecognisable. - Play romance, teacher. - Which one? Whichever, even Traviata. [Gracious French] - Timote, I want to go home! - Your Excellence, wait! You're in a hurry again, Prince. - Didn't you like our beauty? - Beauty? She's screwed up on one side! Then look at her from the other side! Look at those hands! Look at those legs! What is he trying to show? One leg is shorter than the other! - But the other one is longer. - Much longer! - Moreover, it's only visible when she walks. - When I walk! But when she sits, stands, lies - nothing is visible. - Look at her eyes! - She's blind in one eye! Oh, Prince, could I have one teeny-tiny flaw with such a dowry? One teeny-ti... I don't need your dowry and I won't set my foot here ever again. - Wait! I haven't shown you everything.... - I want to go home! - She's undressing! - I can dance! Teacher, play music. Akop, help. Help with what? "I'm strolling down the street..." What? "I'm strolling down the street..." I'm strolling down the street... then I see a gal! I aligned with her and told her straight: - Madame? - A girl! - Free? - Like a bird! - Don't believe you. - How could you! - Let's go? - Of course! Timote, I beg you, get me out of here! Oh, Hanuma! What an actress! How did she learn French? A matchmaker must be skilled in everything! If I need to marry off a Chinese man tomorrow, I'll learn Chinese as well. Thank you, Hanuma. Let me kiss you too. Wait, the bride is happy because the old man won't take her. Why are YOU happy, teacher? Because the bride will be his. Don't you see they love each other? Hanuma, how did you know? There's one French word for that. - Come here. - What word? - "Intuition". Help us! Oh, children, first I need to marry the Prince on my Guliko, then I'll sort you out. Go now, I need to change, been a bride for too long. Hey, hey, don't need to limp. Oh, I forgot. Akop-djan, come here, help me change. Undo the button here. - Where? - Behind. Faster. What's up? What's taking so long? Undid one button and stopped! - Have you lost your arms and legs? - I have both arms and legs. I'm a man, after all. Oh, really! Oi, dear, if you're a man, then I'm not a woman. I'm a matchmaker! A matchmaker, dear! Hey, Akop-djan! - Yes? - If you're a man, as you say, why aren't you married yet? I like freedom more. And then, a married man is like a bird in a cage. Also, there's no woman on Earth that Akop would like. - Even so! - She mustn't be old, but not young either. Modest, but not shy. Slim, but not starving. Also no tobacco sniffing, like you do. - And the most important... - Yes? She must be smart. - No smarter than I, of course. - But of cours- - What is this? - What is that? Let me in! - Let me in at once! - Kabato! Interesting, what is she going to do now? Where's the bride? - Wailing, the Prince didn't like her. - What do you mean?! Didn't like her, that's all. - Who's that? - I'm the great-grandmother. Ah, right, the great-grandma showed up for the wedding, but there won't be one. What do you mean?! Don't jinx it, old bag! I'll die to make the wedding happen! Die, then, Kabato. There will be a wedding, Kabato, there will be, just a completely different one. The one that Hanuma wants! Since the dawn of times, there hasn't been a better matchmaker in the world. All day deep in her work, She lets the human race carry on. As there can't be a dinner without entertainment, Aragvi without water, a bazaar without persimmon, there can't be a wedding without Hanuma! Drinking alone is a sin, being a bachelor is a sin. Without a friend, without a wife, living like that is a sin! Since the dawn of times, there hasn't been a better matchmaker in the world. All day deep in her work, she lets the human race carry on. As there can't be a dinner without entertainment, Aragvi without water, a bazaar without persimmon, there can't be a wedding without Hanuma! Drinking alone is a sin, being a bachelor is a sin! Without a friend, without a wife, living like that is a sin! End of part one HANUMA by A. Tsagareli Part two As soon as I close my eyes, you stand before me. As soon as I open my eyes, your image clouds my sight. Go visit Ortachala, take a look at who I am! When we hit the cymbals, take a look at who I am! Entertainer lost in tobacco smoke, take a look at who I am! Good man in a fistfight, take a look at who I am! You take a look and fall in love. You fall in love and you come closer. As soon as I close my eyes, you stand before me. As soon as I open my eyes, your image clouds my sight. The house of Prince Pantiashvili Lord, why have you punished us? Why did you meddle with that scoundrel Kabato? Why did you reject Guliko Mohnadze? O Lord forgive us! Forgive u- Stop lecturing me! I haven't slept all night. "As soon as I close my eyes..." I see that monster. As if she's hugging me like this, with two hands. "Image clouds my sight..." She hugs alright, what's so scary about that? "Scary"! If only you'd seen her! Do not let that scoundrel Kabato on my porch! - Kabato's here, Prince. - What? Kick her out! Out! - The Prince doesn't want to see her. - No, he does! Let her in. I'll make lyulya kebab out of her! You'll have to add some sauce to that lyulya kebab, she's not alone. Prince, my dear, what happened? I came back this morning and see: mommy's unconscious, daughter's in tears. Perhaps you didn't like the way the door was opened for you? Or how the table was set? I told you Hanuma was involved in this! - Could very well be. - Why didn't you sit at the table? Try the chicken? - Drink the wine? Why? - He dares to ask why! You want to drop off some old goods, push a centipede into my hands? Our white swan - a centipede?! The world has never seen such a bride! Sure. Not SUCH a bride indeed. [French] - What did he say? - Also a centipede, but six times worse. What?! You should be keeping that horror in a cage, not at home! - Where? - A cage, he's threatening to put you in jail. Jail!! Get over here! What? All the more! So, I don't speak French much these days... I figured. I'll tell you this, old monkey. What? - A bag of sawdust. - What? - Moustached scarecrow! - Scarecrow? You're a scarecr- I'll kill you! Shoot you! Timote, where's my gun? - In the pawn shop. - Very good. Didn't want to waste a bullet on him anyways. Out of my house! - Not your, MY house! Buy out the bonds first! - Here they are! - Hold me! - Hold me! - Wait, Mikich, you can't let such a groom get away! - Can't let him get in either. You need to let the dogs out on him! Wait! Where are you going to find such a son-in-law? - So what, we can find anyone we want with our money. - That's right, Akop! - Wait! And the coat of arms? - A merchant should have pride. With a coat of arms, there will be pride. You're a merchant, you must understand! Adamyan paid a dowry twice the size of ours, but the Prince turned out to be fake, just a second cousin. Here, the Prince is real, and the coat of arms is real. Don't be greedy, Mikich. If the problem is only in the sum, I agree! Prince, let's forget everything we've said here! Are we some grandmas brawling at the bazaar or something? - I give a thousand more! - A thousand more! - No! - Two! - Gives two! - No! Don't settle for that, brother. Why do we need nightmares during sleep? - Three! - He gives three! - No! - I'd marry a croc for such money! - That's right, four! Four! We can fix the house, buy out the bonds, help Kote out, get the manor back! - Think about it, brother! - No! No, no! For I, Prince Pantiashvili, to sell my honour and freedom for four thousand coins? Never! For five, yes. - 4500! - 4800, 300 on top. - Why? - For bodily harm. That white swan of yours trampled over both my feet. Fine! But the wedding will be today! Then money first! Everybody wants to live like in heaven. Everybody is looking for something to gain. Make a good purchase! Make a good sale! Grab more! And give less! - Prince! - Yes? - I'm going to the bank right away. - Please. Say hello to Hanuma from me. With a kiss! I will! Well? Are you happy, sister? I think you were saying that your brother is a money waster and an idler? I've earned almost five thousand in five minutes! My Prince status is also a sellable good, mind you! Strong feelings must go with money, otherwise - au revoir. - Right, everything's good, one thing's bad. - What's bad? What's bad? Gotta marry, that's what's bad. Who thought of attaching a bride to a dowry? And what kind of br... My God! I remember her and have th- no, shivers THIS big going down my spine! That's all right, brother. You'll have the wedding in the evening, and in the morning, flee to Petersburg alone. Morning! Morning! And the night? What am I going to do in the night? His very garden Hanuma! Hanuma! Why are you shouting? I'm here. What? - What are you doing here? - "What am I doing"! I'm observing. - What, from the barrel? - Why are you surprised? I climbed into a chimney once when I was younger. And slimmer. From the chimney - right into the groom's chambers, got him right off the marriage bed and married him on my bride. Well? How are they? - Bad. - What's bad? Nothing will work out this time for you, even if you squeeze through a needle hole. - And why? - The Prince marries Sona. - How? - Just like that. - First it went as you wanted, they almost killed each other. - Good. Then that Kabato intervened, said, give the Prince more money. They've bargained for five thousand, Mikich went to get the money. She won! Outsmarted me! Outplayed! And who is she? Kabato! Who's got neither tact nor intuition, always going straight through! - I'm closing my office down. What grief has fallen on my gray head! - Wait-wait. - Seems like not all my hairs are gray yet, Akop-djan? - No, not all, of course! Looks like not everything is lost yet. - Do you play chess, Akop-djan? - Chess? No. Only backgammon. Eh, backgammon! Go as the dice tells you. Chess is the game of the wise. Shota Rustaveli played with queen Tamara. My dear Suren played too. - Who's that? - My grandfather. The way he played! You have to think ahead in chess. Kabato thinks one move in advance, but I must think through six. - She goes here, I go... - What? Wait, she goes there, I go here. - Why did you close your eyes? - Don't disturb me, I'm playing blind. She makes a move, and I... Nothing will work out. She can make a different move. You either sneeze quicker, or think faster. Listen! Time to bust a move. What move? While Mikich is gone, go home and bring your best horse. - What horse? - Hire a phaeton. - And bring the queen here. - What queen? Sona. Our beauty. Bring the phaeton straight into the garden. Got it, Akop-djan? What are you up to? A three-move combination. You're off to get Sona, Sona's off to here, and my Guliko's off to get married. Got it, my dear Akop? My dear djan! Hey, Timote? Where are you, my dear? Who am I to you? Who are you going after? I am all on fire because of you. I want to curse you - but my tongue cannot. I want to berate you - but my soul cannot. I want to run - but my legs cannot. I am in pain! Jumped straight into the fire! Who am I to you? Who are you going after? Why am I all poetic out of a sudden? What did she order? Sona, phaeton... - You again? - Me again. - Kabato said hi. - Really? - With a kiss. - Thanks. - Why are you here? - Came to see the Prince. He's sleeping. Ordered not to let anyone in. How much did Kabato give you to let her in? Thirty abaz before the wedding, fifty after, she said. Why are you lying, dear? Ten before the wedding, thirty after, I know her prices. Here! Twenty now and sixty - after the wedding. Wake the Prince up. - Too bad. - What's too bad? Too bad the Prince's only got two matchmakers. Good luck. - To Kabato, too. - "Kabato, too!" Scoundrel. - Kabato! - Prince! That's for you. Hanuma again? What do you want? - I heard you didn't like the bride yesterday? - Didn't like her yesterday - liked her today. Oh, I don't believe that such a handsome, such a pleasant man would marry someone this ugly. Oh get lost, Hauma, go away, don't rub the salt in. You're not a man! Would a real man think about money when getting married? What about, then? You can't take money by the hand while walking down the street. You can't bring a chest full of silver to your friend's house. Neither a sheep, a cow or a horse, - You can only bring a... - Wife. Well, Vano, you can only take your wife outside when it's dark. Stop it, stop it. - I pity you, brother. - Stop, I beg you. You will go to Hell! Please don't. With such a Satan, you will go to Hell! Please don't. Neither gem or diamond will tell you gentle words, you can't dance with a dowry, you can't bed a dowry. - Even if it's worth a million, for all these things you need a... - Wife, I know. But your wife, Vano, is a joke to even sit with. I beg you, stop. I pity myself, brother! I will go to Hell! With such a Satan, I will go to Hell! I pity you so much! Fine, fine! Where do I find a bride with a good face, and "money" written all over that face? - I had one like this. - I know! Guliko Mohnadze, I've heard. You heard alright, but you never saw her. You never went to the showing. Enough! I've seen enough of one bride already. And then, I gave my word to Mikich already. Here, he's coming back! You're wrong, dear. This is Guliko Mohnadze. Going to an artist, to paint her portrait for a museum. Goodbye, Prince. I've got no time for you. The man came from France just for this job. Hanuma! Who is this in the phaeton, the beautiful one? Is it a servant? Listen, where have you seen such servants? That's Guliko Mohnadze herself! - Hanuma! - Heard that? The voice! Like a bird, like a bird! Hanuma, let me look at her. She's my ex-bride, after all. - Never, my dear! Ah, fine, just for you. - Just for me! - And only for a minute. - Only for a minute! - Go change. - Why? She'd think you're a sauna worker in these clothes. - I'll change! - Go, my dear. One moment~ - What happened? - Sona! - Do you love Kote? - So much! Then make the Prince fall in love with you. The Prince? Yesterday you made him hate me, and now you want him to fall for me? Listen, you have to. You're not Sona right now, you are Guliko Mohnzade. Understand? Be gentle with the Prince, smile, flirt, say something smart. Something smart? - I grew up in a merchant's house, not in a noble one. - Merchant's? Then act like a merchant. Smile as if you're making an advance payment. Flirt as if you're setting up a loan. - Sell the goods with your face. - Hanuma! - I'm finishing up my hair! - Finish up, then! What is there to finish up? Hanuma! My God! Who is this? It is me. A beauty! Sorry for making you wait. - Pronounciation! Parisian pronounciation! - What are you going about the nose? Look at her lips, eyes! No one in Paris has anything like this! Guliko! It's a pity I'm not an artist! Although, would an artist be able to capture these heavenly, gorgeous, unique... Stop galloping, Prince, there's no time. ...these godly features! What a pity I never saw you before, Guliko! That's Hanuma's fault, she painted me a totally different picture of you. - I was afraid you won't marry a young one. - Really? You have to protect a young one, watch over a young one, entertain a young one, - ...and you're already... - What? What?! I'm still something! Oh, Guliko, you're a spring sun! You make me dizzy like wine! You opened my gates to heaven, at which I've been knocking for so long. Heaven's gate, spring sun, oh you, old flirt! Don't sit around like you're numb, smile to him at least once! Oh, Prince, I'm glad we've met. Let me fall at your feet! Tell him not to fall. He won't be able to get up by himself. You are a gift from fate itself, my spring, my star! I'm ready to be at your side till the end of times, just say "yes"! Be submissive, kind, smart, say "yes", Guliko. His end of times is not that far off! I agree to be your wife. Oh, the flower of my soul! My king, my god, my angel... Enough! Quick, sign the paper! Goodbye! Goodbye, a flower from Eden! - My joy! Goodbye! - Calm down, dear. Prince! Sign the paper. What paper? We don't need bureaucracy. A Prince's word. - Eh, no, Prince. I have a stache myself. - Really? - Here, sign it. Take it. - Sign, yes. - That's for you. - For me! - That's for us. - Also for me! - No, that's also for us. - All for me! - Deal. - Deal! - Goodbye, Prince! - Goodbye! - Till the wedding, Prince. - Till the wedding! - Till tomorrow! - I won't live till tomorrow! Oh just you try not to! Also, Prince, if Kabato comes, say hi to her from the great-grandmother. - With a hot kiss. - I will, I will! Tekle! Timote! Where are you? Come here! What happened, brother? What is this? Guliko, my dear! I don't want anyone else near! I've waited for this moment for so long, and it's finally here! Here! Your money, Prince. Five thousand! Ah! Guliko, my dear! Guliko? Guliko Mohnadze? Kabato! A passionate hello to you from the great-grandmother, with a kiss. Hanuma! Did she cross our path again? Guliko again? You're marrying Sona! Wake up, brother! - Are you drunk? - I am! Drunk from happiness! I'm marrying my beauty Guliko. Guliko, my dear! Come to the wedding tomorrow, Mikich. Bring your centipede along too, please. - Listen, Prince... - Yes? Either you're marrying my sweet daughter, or I'm strangling you with these two hands. Why hands? Use the bonds! Good thinking, Kabato! Here's all your debts to the butcher, bath attendant, duhan owner! This is where you are! With interest! I'm giving you 24 hours. Either you marry my centi- MY SWEET DAUGHTER! Or you'll be rotting in the debtor's prison! Prepare him some prison snacks! What to do, brother? What time is it? 24 hours left. Shame! Shame on all our kin! Pantiashvilis never went to prison! Eureka! - Another one? - Quiet! Quiet! I will wash the shame away. With my own blood. Timote! Where's my gun? - In the pawn shop. - Don't remind me! Give me a hunting rifle. Let's bring up the dog too. I'll do it anyway. Where's soap? Where's the washcloth? Where are my clean clothes? Why? - Why does he need clean clothes, Timote? - Eh, I think I know. That's a tradition. You can die all you want, but please wear clean clothes before that happens. Die? Orbeliani sulphur bathhouse Why were we invited? We've been here just two days ago. I'm forbidden to bathe and shave either way. Forty days haven't passed since my great-grandfather died, let him rest in peace. Rest in peace! He said we should come immediately. Urgent business! Why sauna, if it's urgent? Why not a duhan? If it's a joke, then that's a very dumb joke. Kote! The servant came, asked to come here immediately. Never said why. - Hey Kote, who's that with you? - That? My friend. He's underdeveloped. Must be a Prince too. Finally, Vano! - What happened, Vano? - I'll explain everything. Timote! My friends! Together we've been drinking, partying, sharing ups and downs. That's true. Now, you will be doing all that without me. What is he saying? - He's getting married, probably. - Leaving to Paris again, probably. To Paris! Paris? No! I'm not leaving to Paris. I'm going to where nobody has ever returned from. What's the most important thing for a nobleman? Honour and obligation. - I've been choosing between honour and obligation. - What did you choose? Turns out, the obligations were too many. So today, I have decided to wash the shame off my family in this sulphur bath. Today, exactly at ten... What time is it? - The duhan ones show five to. - Quiet! Today at ten, I will end my life! Wouldn't you do the same? Same! Exactly the same! Thank you for coming. We will drink with you for the last time, then I will get in the bath and open my... - Uncle! - Don't interupt! Don't interrupt when the elders are speaking! A boy! Let's continue. You see! Right! Thank you for coming, I raise this glass to everyone present. - Wait, dear. - What? - Don't hurry. - Why? Why hurry? Don't hurry. You don't need to hurry anymore. Even such a truly saddening event, so to say, does not give you the right to go against our ancient traditions. It doesn't! - First you need to choose an entertainer. - Of course! Choose his assistant, then drink after the house in which all these Princes have gathered. They've all arrived here on your first call! Then we should drink after all the deceased friends and family. Then drink after all the living, then after everyone currently absent, and only then we can drink after everyone present, but after each one of us separately. I don't understand you. They'll close the baths when I get to killing myself! - What's wrong? - I don't feel well. - Go outside, then. - Come back soon, Kote, we'll drink after you and your inheritance. - What's there to inherit? A washcloth, maybe? - Quiet! Go fill the bath. Idler! Princes! The farewell song! Farewell, farewell, Vano! We're drinking this wine for the very last time. But you can't escape what's decided by your fate. No, we will never forget this day, old friend. We'll all be there soon too, get us a barrel of wine. Princes, my time has come. Farewell, Guram! Farewell, Givi! Farewell, Mazhiko! Farewell, Sandro! Farewell, Dika. What do you want? One, two, three, four... Ah, farewell to you all. I'll leave like a true Frenchman, English style. So nobody notices me. What a man has left us! He was truly, so to say, a prisoner of honour. - That's it! - What? - Gone. - Already? Water's gone. - I'll go ask when they'd turn it back on. - Never! - Water's been turned off, Kote turned it off! - Hanuma! - A woman in the baths! - Aren't you ashamed? Men are naked! Why is everyone so shy out of a sudden, Prince Guram? If I hadn't married you to that rich widow, you'd be walking around naked like in the bath all your life! And you, Prince? If I hadn't climbed that chimney, you would've gone down the drain too! - And you! - Where have you come to? Leave, shameless woman! - I need to see the Prince! - Get out! Prince, come here! Do you want to die, are you crazy? Die for all I care, but who will follow your casket? The duhan owner who you pay with your watch? - The coddler who cashes out your moustache? - My friends will follow my casket! - Will you? - We will! You will, for the drinks at his wake. - Who will be paying for that wake? - Them. See, my dear? You need money to die too. Marry my Guliko, get the dowry, pay me, and then die as much as you want! - Guliko - any time. But what about Mikich's daughter? - What about her? Marry her. Are you crazy? You want me to be tried as a bigamist now? Listen, why should YOU marry? Your nephew Kote will. - Me? - Yes. You're no worse. Also a Prince. Also a Pantiashvili. Also penniless. Get lost, woman! You want to throw the child into that crocodile's mouth? Never! Uncle! Let me sacrifice myself. - Oh? - For you, I am ready to do everything! I will save your honour, and the honour of our family! Good fellow! I won't allow my only uncle to be buried in debt! Let him be in a sauna with friends instead. I will marry Sona Kontryants! - What? That centipede? - Oh, what to do! Are you telling the truth? A Prince's word! A true man! Kote, my boy! I won't forget your good deed! You know what? If you need a break from this one, go visit my house. My Guliko will meet you, feed you, you'll sit at the fireplace, sit on a sofa, enjoy her company for an hour, and feel better already. Anytime, night or day. Please come. Good, good. No, no! Better come during the day. After you, nephew, and after him! Wait, uncle, pour some for Hanuma. Dear! I can't drink on the job. I still need to marry you instead of your uncle. You think it's easy? Prince! - Yes? - Prince! - Let's go! - Where? The water's here. Why do we need water? Princes! We have wine! After you, Vano! Let's bathe first! Live for another century, Vano! Sing songs and drink wine! You'll get to Heaven either way, so please don't hurry to die. No, we won't forget this day, old friend. We'll all be there soon too, so get us a barrel of wine. As soon as I close my eyes, you stand before me. As soon as I open my eyes, your image clouds my sight. A gentle poplar, is your figure like to me. A bright rainbow, is your figure like to me. Sparkling lightning, are your eyes like to me. Fresh roses, are your lips like to me. If only could I ask you, when will you ever come? As soon as I close my eyes, you stand before me. As soon as I open my eyes, your image clouds my sight. The house of Mikich Kotryants Why are you sitting here? I've made chicken, do you want it? I don't, granny. What? A little diet would be good for my body. Who needs your body? That old Prince? He needs your money, not your body. I like that teacher too, by the way. A man of my taste. Really, granny? You think granny is deaf and numb? I can see and hear everything. When you played the piano with four hands, I heard only two. Where were the other two? You think I didn't see? I'll smash everything to hell! Is father still angry? He is, waiting for the Prince. Like a tiger in a cage. Hear that? The tupperware! Saxonian tea service! The Chinese vase! He's coming! Why didn't he like her? Went blind with age, perhaps. Well? Where's your Prince? One hour left. He'll come, don't worry. Even the bravest man fears jail more than marriage. What if he doesn't come? I've installed the coat of arms on my carriage already. All of Avlabar will laugh at me. And Adamyan will wheeze. He'll die from laughter then, one competitor less. The Prince is here! I told you! - Meet the Prince! My white swan, why didn't he like her? - Well? The teacher is here. What lessons now? What did he teach Sona? The Prince didn't like her, let him leave. Wait! Let him come in. Come in, teacher, dear. Good day. Your teacher, Sona. Good day, Sona Mikichevna. Good day, Kote Luarsabovich. Where are we going to study today? Here. We'll have an exam. - An exam? - Yes! I want to see what I am paying you for. As you wish. What should we do first? - Declamation, if you allow. - I do. Start with that declamation. - Voila! - Voiley, then. This is a French play. It's set far away in Paris, in a house of the Countess. Countess de Montparnasse! Countess de Montmartre! The final scene before the end. Act five. Countess! Yesterday I've been wandering around the gardens, among cold marble statues, when suddenly, I found a quiet gazebo, overgrown with ivy and grapes. Countess! Do you remember the lady who promised to help us? Lady? What lady? Countess! Do you remember the lady who promised to help us? I saw her today in the sulphur baths! A woman in a men's bath house? I've heard that the French are perverted, but to that extent... Akop! What th- Go check if it's actually written there! Well? It is! It's such a woman, she can do anything. All of Avlabar knows her. Wait-wait! Where is it happening? In Paris or Avlabar? - In Paris. - How? They've got their own Avlabar there. Oh? So what did that shameless woman say to the Count in the bath house? - What'd she say? - Yes, she said. Go see what she said! What'd she say? "Don't hurry, Count!", she said. "Have some patience, Count", she said. "All due its time, Count", she said. Understand? Countess! - Well, go on. - Keep reading! C'mon! - Oh, Count! - Good! - I've been wandering around Montmartre, - Good job! when suddenly, in a bookshop, I've found sonnets that you used to read to me. I can't wait anymore! I love you, Kote! What does it say, Count or Kote? Kote! Kote! That's what it says in my heart, father! We love each other! From the first sight! From the first lesson! Without love, the world is a dawn without sun, a fire without flames, a djigit without a horse! Without love, the world is a dawn without sun, a fire without flames, a djigit without a horse! Mikich Narsasovich! Can I have Sona Mikichna's hand? You're asking for what?! - A hand... - A HAND?! Don't set your FOOT in my house ever again! Slumdog count! No! Don't touch me! I'll leave myself. Father! - Father, dear, you just don't know... - I don't want to know! Get out! Then I'll go after him! Where? Wait! "After him!". Bread and water, will I feed you! Locketh her up! Mama! Guard her! Kabato! Go in the garden, and make sure she doesn't escape through the windows. Akop! Guard the place, don't let anyone but the Prince in! And send these French books back to the shop! Mama! As soon as I close my eyes, you stand before me. As soon as I open my eyes, your image clouds my sight. The Prince has agreed! Daughter! He's sent his servant! - What's your name, dear? - Timote. Timote, repeat again what the Prince has said! Prince said, years fly by and a heir's nowhere in sight. So he says, for his blood to carry on, he agrees to any moron. - You..! - Even to your centipede. I'll punch you so hard ri- He's agreed, agreed, but with one condition: a kidnapping. - Kidnapping? - Pantiashvilis always kidnap their brides, a family tradition. The Prince can't go against it. I told you not to trust the Prince, you're giving him a stone house and five grand, and he still wants a kidnapping. Silence! What should we do? Here, wrap the bride in this carpet, I'll take her. He'll take her. The Prince and the phaeton are waiting behind the corner. I get it. Get in the phaeton and go to the pastor. - The pastor's behind the corner too. - Why the phaeton then? - A tradition. - Tradition, then. Open all doors and windows and scream for the whole street to hear, "The bride's been kidnapped!" I see. - What should I do? - Akop, wrap her up. No, I don't like this tradition! Wrap me up with Sona too! - You're not the one getting kidnapped! - I don't like any of this! No! I don't want this! C'mon! You gotta, sweetie! Wrap her up! Carefully! Don't hurt the child, careful! My sweetie! Take her out! The bride's been kidnapped! The bride's been kidnapped! Wait! Who kidnapped her? - The Prince did, they're off to church. - Is it true, Mikich? Oh, my poor Guliko! - You've grown old, Hanuma, it's time to retire. - You're right. If you can't drive firewood on an araba, then the araba itself should become firewood. Don't be sad, Hanuma! You'll have fun with us at the wedding, I invite everyone. All of Avlabar! There's a mountain by a lake, by the mountain flows Kura, behind Kura, a noisy bazaar after the bazaar there stands Avlabar. Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! Infinite and carefree, always noisy, our Avlabar! Kabato! Run to the bazaar, buy flowers, lots of flowers! We'll throw them at their feet, that's a tradition. Mama! - Are the tables set? - They are! - Are all the bottles open? - They are! Let's go check! Please check, dear. Hanuma! Hanum-djan! I've found myself a bride too, by the way. Really? She's pretty, she's tactful. She'd give a hundred points headstart to any woman, outplay any man. There's no such woman in Avlabar. - There is! - Who? You... Listen, I don't have time to joke around with you. - I've got a real client waiting. - I'm not joking! I'm serious! I've been looking for someone like you all my life. I dreamed about you. No, you dreamed about freedom. Who said that a married man is like a bird in a cage? When there are two birds in a cage, it's not a cage anymore. It's a nest. I'm waiting for you to say "yes". You are hurrying too much. I'm not young anymore. I'm not a boy either. I can barely cook, I'm a bad mistress. I also like to sniff tobacco. I don't care for that. We're both loners. - Hanum-djan! - Akop-djan! - We should marry immediately, Hanum-djan! - Akop-djan! We don't have to pay a matchmaker, so don't delay the wedding! I'm younger than Guliko, but older than Sona. I'm no Venus. And I'm no Apollo. I'm also cunning and smart. It's alright that you're smart. My wife can have a flaw, after all. We're both loners. - Hanum-djan! - Akop-djan! - We should marry immediately, Hanum-djan! - Akop-djan! We don't need to pay a matchmaker, so don't delay the wedding! Let me go! Hey, let me go! What is this I don't understand! Let's go announce our wedding, I beg you. Don't hurry me, Akop-djan, I can't marry now. To marry is to leave my job. A wife and a matchmaker are two different professions. Let Kabato take over, pass your clients on to her. Oi, you can pass on the clients, but can I pass on that... What? Well, that!.. People call it passion, I think. You know, a good matchmaker is like a poet, appears only once in a century. A poet and a matchmaker, sure. I don't know any beautiful words, Akop-djan. But I think that anyone who puts their soul into their job is truly a poet. That's right. A good shepherd is a poet. - A good smith is a poet. - That's right, too. A good cobbler is also a poet. - And a bad one? - A bad one? - Just a cobbler, what is there to say. - That's right, too! The Prince! Mama, the Prince is here! - Be prosperous, Mikich! - Good day, everyone! Congratulations, son! Please don't, I beg you! Apologies, dear, I haven't got you a present, didn't know if you'd come or not. Although no, I've got one for you. What's wrong, dear? Dishevelled? Here! All bonds of yours! All paid. Thank you. But I can return the money only after the wedding. What money? What money, dear? - What money? - Why are you throwing me around like this? We're one family now. My house is your house. Your house is my house! Your house is my house! So, my nephew sorted it out with you already then. What nephew? My nephew. - What nephew? - Our nephew. He sorted it out. - What out? - The marriage. - What marriage? - To your daughter. He agreed. We came because of him. You came because of him? Because of him. So, he kidnaps my daughter, but the nephew's the one who marries? Nephew marries, and he kidnaps, my daughter... Kidnap what? Who? When? Me? Kidnapped? Pantiashvilis never did that. - Who kidnapped, then? - Come here. We did! Timote, Akop and I did so she'd be happy, so you'd have beautiful grandkids. I don't need grandkids, I need a coat of arms. A coat of arms! You'll have a coat of arms! He's a Prince too. - Who? - Here! That's him! With the centipede. Who? This guy? Stop messing around with me! That's our teacher. That's our nephew! That's Prince Kote Pantiashvili. What Prince is he if he's working? He'll get the dowry and stop working. I don't need your dowry, I'll achieve everything myself. I will make her happy with my own efforts! - Without love, the wor- - Too early! The centipede sings! Good fellow! Why didn't you say you're a Prince before? Let me hug you! Right now she's covered by the veil, but as soon as it's off... I also started without a penny. I like you, Kote! There she is! I like him, too. Guliko, dear, what are you doing here? My master's gone nuts again. Are you insane, Prince? That's my daughter Sona, you didn't like her yesterday. I didn't like her yesterday? Who did you show me yesterday, scum? Me! Well, have I done anything wrong? A young Prince marries a young lady out of love. - An old Prince... - What did you say? Oh, pardon! An ageing Prince marries a dowry, and gets my Guliko as a bonus. She's also not that old, only fifty-five. What? Yesterday you said she was fifty. Don't argue with me or she'll get older. Mikich will get a noble coat of arms, and I will get my commission! What else do you need? What else do we need? A drink, and a snack. Don't be shy, then! Everyone to the table! What's going on? Not enough flowers, Kabato! There are two weddings today! - No! Three! - Why three? Count them yourself. Sona and Kote, one! The Prince and my Guliko Mohnadze, that's two! Where's my sweetie? The Prince marries Sona! No, it all goes my way today! You wrote me off too early. Oh, shame on me, my end has come! If I couldn't marry a young and a beautiful one off, why should such a matchmaker exist? Don't scold yourself so much, now you're the lead matchmaker of Avlabar. Since you managed to marry Hanuma herself off. What? I'm marrying Akop! - Pay the fees, at least. - Here! Thirty abaz. No, twenty's plenty. Only Hanuma ever got thirty. My friends! Today is an extraordinary day! Three weddings at on- Regardless, let's not taint our ancient traditions! First, let's drink after everyone who gathered us all here. After everyone who drew all of this! After the one who wro- Wah! Who wrote the music! And drink after the one who created it all! After Hanuma! Since the dawn of times, there hasn't been a better matchmaker in the world. Whether you're old or young, she'll pick the right good for you. There is no celebration without an entertainer, no Aragvi without water, no bazaar without persimmon, no wedding without Hanuma! Drinking alone is a sin! Being a bachelor is a sin! Without a friend, without a wife, living like that is a sin! Since the dawn of times, there hasn't been a better matchmaker in the world. All day deep in her work, she lets the human race carry on. There is no celebration without an entertainer, no Aragvi without water, no bazaar without persimmon, no wedding without Hanuma! Drinking alone is a sin! Being a bachelor is a sin! Without a friend, without a wife, living like that is a sin! Starring: Hanuma - L. Makarova Prince - V. Strzhelchik Mikich Kotryants - V. Medvedev Kabato - V. Kovel Akop - N. Trofimov Timote - V.
