♪ (affectionate music) "Oh living flame of love, that tenderly wounds my soul on its deepest center. Since now You are not oppressive, now consummate! If it be your will, "tear through the veil of this sweet encounter!" My name is Don Alonso Alvarez de Toledo. And I want to tell you the story of the greatest poet that Spain has ever known. I met him in 1554 when he was only a boy very, very poor but nevertheless extraordinary. I felt that even then. What was so extraordinary about him? Well, he didn't have an easy life. He suffered greatly. But inside, that's where the real drama was, in his heart. (longing music continues) When a man is in love, and John was in love with God, he will never be satisfied with anything less than total union with his beloved. So he sought a life of contemplation and poverty and sacrifice in the Carmelite Order. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Listen as I tell you the story of John of the Cross. (birds twitter) (grass rustles) - [Alonso] Her name was Catalina Alvarez. And she was destitute and homeless. Her husband had just died. And bread was not to be had for any money. It was a three-day journey from her village to the town of Torrijos. Yet she had to make the trip. For in Torrijos lived the brother of her dead husband. This brother was wealthy, and perhaps he would help her small son, John. It was her only hope. - My brother was dead to me long ago, Señora. When he married you, he disgraced the de Yepes' family name. There is nothing I can do for you. - But this is your nephew, your own flesh and blood, Señor. Look at him, look. Do not leave him in this misery. For God's mercy, Señor, have pity. - This child is nothing to me. Please, Señora, you really must leave. (dejected music) Go away now. - Catalina had nowhere to go. She continued on her journey, begging for food along the way until she finally settled here in Medina del Campo, where she found work as a weaver. Nine years passed during which John grew into an exceptionally bright young boy. But he was isolated from the other children by his quiet nature. His mother loved him very much and taught him to love God. (affectionate music continues) - My son, we are poor. It's true. But you must always remember to have hope, because we have Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin to watch over us. - [Alonso] Catalina was determined to get him an education. So she came to me one day and asked me to take John under my patronage so that he could attend the Jesuit college. I was the Administrator of the plague hospital here in town, and I had a place for a quick-witted eager and zealous boy who could assist me in caring for the sick. So I decided to help him. - [Adult John] "Where have you hidden, Beloved", and left me moaning. You fled like the stag after wounding me. I went out calling you. And you were gone. "Seeking my love, I will head for the mountains and for watersides. I will not gather flowers nor fear wild beasts. "I will go beyond strong men and frontiers." - More years passed. And John grew into a remarkable young man. He had a special gift for caring for the sick. He was kind and very devout. He spent many hours in prayer. But the other students didn't understand that. They thought him a bit aloof. But I knew him better. He was a brilliant student. And I was so proud of him. However, I was concerned about his future. He had become like a son to me. And I didn't want to lose him. - John, close that book for a minute. I need to talk to you. - Yes, Don Alonso. - You've been so preoccupied these last few weeks. You seem so far away. - I'm sorry, Don Alonso. (John sighs) Don Alonso, you've been so kind to me. I feel I could never repay you. - What nonsense. Do you know what a consolation you have been to me? I never had a son of my own, John. And you have become like my own flesh and blood. Don't worry your head about repaying me. I'm more than glad to have you here. - Don Alonso, listen to me. I need to tell you something even if it makes you angry. My final examinations are next month. And, after that, I, Don Alonso, I want to be a priest. - Wonderful, wonderful, my boy. (chuckles) Why ever did you hesitate to tell me? This is exactly what I had in mind for you all a long. Ha ha, then after you are ordained, I have a prestigious opportunity for you. I will appoint you the Chaplain of the plague hospital. Now, what will your mother say to that do you think? - You don't understand. I can't stay. I have to... (affectionate music) Did you ever love someone so much that you were willing to give up everything for that person? Well, that is how I feel. I want to spend myself totally for my God. Only in total sacrifice of my will will I have any hope for peace on this earth. I believe I have found a place where such a life is possible. Don Alonso, God is calling me to enter the Carmelites. - The Carmelites? John, you can't be serious. Do you have any idea what a Carmelite is? Why, all they do is pray. And you, with all your education, think of the good you could do here. How can you think of wasting your life, your mind, your talents? No, no, no, no, I'm sure God wants you here in the hospital with me. - But, Don Alonso, I- - All your life you've been poor. All your life you've been an outcast. Do you think it will be any different with the Carmelites? It will be the same there. Please be practical. (breathes) With me you will have a comfortable life. Think of your poor mother. Under the circumstances, I must forbid you to leave. - Don Alonso, I will think about what you have said, (affectionate music) but I won't disobey God's call. - [John] "One dark night", fired with love's urgent longings, ah, the sheer grace! I went out unseen, "my house being now all stilled." - [Alonso] When I found out that he had left, I was filled with sadness. I suppose I felt he had rejected and turned his back on me. But I didn't realize then how right the Carmelite Order would be for John. He had a passionate desire for prayer, and in their contemplative life, he could seek a union with God. (adventurous music) - [John] "Pouring out a thousand graces", he passed these groves in haste. And having looked at them, with his image alone, clothed them in beauty. (triumphant organ music) - [Alonso] So on the 24th day of February, 1563, he was clothed with the Carmelite habit and took the name of Brother John of St. Matthias. (solemn music) - [Friar] What do you seek? - The mercy of God, the poverty of the order, and the society of the brothers. - Do you intend to persevere in religion till the end of your life? - With the mercy of God and the prayers of the brothers, I do. ♪ Come Holy Spirit from above ♪ ♪ Come share your heav'nly light of love ♪ ♪ Come, Father of the poor, ♪ ♪ God of might ♪ ♪ Oh come within our hearts ♪ ♪ now shining bright ♪ (tender music) - I, Brother John, promise to show obedience, poverty, and chastity to God and to the Reverend Father, my brother, Juan Baptista Rubio of Raveena, Prior General of the order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. I thank Our Lord for the grace that He has granted me in allowing me to be admitted into an order of which our patron is God's Blessed Mother. ♪ Come Holy Spirit from above ♪ ♪ Come share your heav'nly light of love ♪ ♪ Come, Father of the poor, ♪ ♪ God of might ♪ ♪ Oh Come, within our hearts ♪ ♪ now shining bright ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Alleluia ♪ (bell tolls) - John wanted to live the Carmelite life in all its fullness, according to the primitive rule. However, not all the friars felt the way he did. (troubled music) The monastery in which he lived had moved away from the original aim of order, which was detachment from the world. Just as I predicted, John gradually began to meet with opposition and jealousy. (Maldonado laughs) (woman laughs) - You asked to see me, Father Maldonado? - Yes, Fray John of St. Matthias. Please, please, sit. Take some wine. (cork pops) (wine splashes) It's an excellent vintage. - No thank you, Father. (bottle clunks) - Fray John, I concerned about something. Your name has come up a number of times. It seems that some of the brothers feel that you're not really participating in the life of the community, that you hold yourself apart. - Father Maldonado, if I've offended anyone in the community I am truly sorry. I've seen the way they look at me. I'm not surprised. I like to be by myself. I came to Carmel to pray to God, to love God, but I have found all my desires frustrated since I entered the order. - I'm not going to say that you are praying too much. That would be ridiculous, of course. But you're so intense. The other brothers say that you act as if you think you are holier than they are. Moderation, my dear Fray John. You should learn to relax and enjoy life a little more. - But Father Maldonado, don't you long for something more, something deeper? Isn't that why we both became Carmelites? Sometimes my heart is so full that I feel as if there is a burning flame of love within me so strong that it could consume my whole being. How can I contain these feelings of love? How can I seek moderation in my desire for God? It seems our order has slid dangerously down the slope of indulgence, Father. (worrisome music continues) Aren't we called to live in total poverty, relying on the mercy of God? All that I seek is to live in detachment from my appetites, so I can't understand what you want of me. - You can't understand what I want. Well, then let me make myself more clear. (wrathful music continues) You are a fanatic. There is no place for your extreme ideas in this order, I can tell you that. Fray John, let me warn you. Unless you change your rebellious ways, your days as a Carmelite will be over. (contemplative music) - [John] "Why, since you wounded this heart", don't you heal it? And why, since you stole it from me, do you leave it so and fail to carry off what you have stolen? "Extinguish these miseries since no one else can stamp them out and may my eyes behold you because you are their light. "And I would open them to you alone." (wind murmurs) (bell peals) (cheerful music) (nuns speaking faintly) - [Alonso] Her name was Madre Teresa de Jesus, Teresa of Avila. And she was the most remarkable woman then living in Spain. For it was she who started the great reform movement within the Carmelite Order, a return to the primitive rule. Her followers were called Discalced Carmelites, because they wore no shoes on their feet. - What kinds of changes do you plan to make within our monastery, mother? - Simply to teach our sisters about the incredible love of Jesus as our founder originally intended. Shall we go in now? - Oh Lord, how is it that you command the impossible? I know what you're calling me to do, but how? How am I to lead the reform not just of the nuns but of the friars as well? If only you would send me some sign, some friar who would share my vision. How long, oh Lord? How long must I wait? Dear Jesus, forgive me. I'm too impatient. But if you want me to do this, send me a friar. - God always listened to Madre Teresa. It wasn't long before she found her friar. In 1567, the year John was ordained a priest, these two mystics, these two giants of the faith, met for the first time. What a moment that must have been. (prayerful music) - [John] "In darkness and secure", by the secret ladder, disguised, ah, the sheer grace! In darkness and concealment, "my house being now all stilled." (curtain rod scrapes) - Peace be with you, Fray John of St. Matthias. - And also with you, Madre Teresa de Jesus. - Fray John, I've heard some disturbing things about you that have made me suspect that you might be just the man I'm looking for. - I know what you've heard. I suppose they've told you that I'm a failure as a Carmelite. I guess it's true. I just don't fit in with the rest of the brothers. I seem to be heading in a very different direction. - Yes, the question is in what direction are you heading. - Oh Madre Teresa, (hopeful music continues) I want to climb to the summit the mountain, I want to attain perfect union with God, and I want to do it quickly because my heart is overflowing with love. - And your brothers do not share your longing or your impatience? - When I speak of leaving behind all earthly things and of avoiding spiritual obstacles, they accuse me of pride and self-righteousness. And I suppose this is always a danger. - Yes, yes, they misunderstand you. I know all about that danger and about your longing too. - I am traveling through a dark night that is difficult to explain. I've not found in the order what I came to seek, a life of contemplation of our Beloved. I am taking steps to withdraw from Carmel and to become a hermit. I've asked the Carthusians to receive me. - Patience, Fray John, patience. How can you think of leaving the order on the eve of its rebirth? You've heard, I suppose, of the reforms that I am instituting among the nuns? - Yes, yes, it's wonderful what you're doing, Mother. - The prior general has granted permission for the foundation of two houses of contemplative Carmelites not just for the nuns but for the friars as well. You, my young outcast, are going to lead the reform of the friars. - Madre Teresa, how can you say that? Ha, the friars won't listen to me. - Ha ha, I don't care about that. You're probably right. I have just one question for you. Are you ready for the cross? - I long for suffering and to be forgotten. - Yes, Fray John. God will grant the desires of your heart. Join with me in renewing the Carmelite family, and you will climb that mountain to your Beloved. - I'm willing to join you but under one condition. Let there be no delay. - Fray John, let your soul be at rest. It shall be done by God. (passionate music) - [John] "Oh living flame of love" that tenderly wounds my soul in its deepest center, since now you are not oppressive, now consummate. If it be your will, tear through the veil of the sweet encounter. (birds twitter) "Oh lamps of fire in whose splendors the deep caverns of feeling, once obscure and blind, now give forth so rarely, so exquisitely, both warmth and light to their beloved. "How gently and lovingly you wake in my heart where in secret you dwell alone, and by your sweet breathing filled with good and glory, "how tenderly you swell my heart with love." (ardent music) - "Dear Madre Anna, what an exciting time it is. The reform is really beginning to take hold. Our faithful friar has a new name, Fray John of the Cross, and he is is fulfilling all my expectations. I feel I have finally found a partner to share this work with me. Fray John knows what the true Carmelite spirit demands: nothing less than perfection. I recently invited him to live in a stone hut just outside the monastery walls, and I think that he's happy here with us. He has embraced an austere life with a passion and seems to thrive on suffering. However, the other friars don't appreciate his good example. It pricks their consciences. Many of them hate him. Yet he is kindness itself for the poor and the sick. I have set him to work as the spiritual advisor of the sisters. He can teach them much about the interior life. Indeed, I myself am learning from him. He's such a wonderful confessor and teacher, never rushing while directing a person to a deeper relationship with God. However, our work here is challenging, to say the least. The sisters enjoy his talks and spiritual direction, but they have a long way to go. This monastery is great only in regards to its size. The nuns in Avila are notorious for their worldliness and gossiping. In fact, things are so bad that the Convent of the Incarnation has been called... "Babylon." (nuns giggle and chatter faintly) (giddy music continues) - [Nun] Don't you think Father Ramirez is handsome? - [Nun] I heard they were caught kissing in the stables. - Has anyone seen Señor Suarez? - [Nun] Tell me, tell me. (nuns chatter and laugh) - [Nun] She's such a prig. (nuns laugh) - [Nun] And she knows, but she always gives me the same penance. - Gradually, over the course of three years, a transformation began to take place at Avila. In his simple persistent way, Father John taught the sisters, who so loved to talk, to love to pray. For prayer is, after all, a talking to God. (solemn music) - In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Jesus be in your souls. Dear sisters, you should live in the monastery as though no one else were in it, never meddling in things that happen in the community nor with individuals. Take no notice of their good or bad qualities or their conduct. You are like the stone which must be chiseled and fashioned before being used in the building. Those who are in the monastery are craftsmen placed there by God to mortify you by chiseling at you. Some will you chisel with words, telling you what you would rather not hear, others, by deed, doing to you what you would rather not endure, others, by their temperament, being in their person and in their actions a bother and annoyance to you, and others, by their thoughts, neither esteeming nor feeling love for you. If this was not your reason for entering the monastery, you should not have done so but should have remained in the world to seek your comfort, honor, reputation, and ease. Strive to pray constantly in all you do. Undertake all things, agreeable or disagreeable, for the sole purpose of pleasing God by carrying Christ's Cross. So sisters, do not engage yourself in something less nor pay heed to the crumbs which fall from your Father's table. Go forth and exult in your glory. Hide yourself in it and rejoice, and you will obtain the desires of your heart. (hopeful music) - [John] "Following your footprints" maidens run along the way. The touch of a spark, the spiced wine, cause flowings in them from the balsam of God. "In the inner wine cellar, I drank of my Beloved, and, when I went abroad through all this valley, I no longer knew anything "and lost the herd which I was following." - The monastery changed from a Babylon to a holy Jerusalem. But persecution was beginning to mount within the order. - [Friar] Father Maldonado, the sisters flock around him as if he were a great saint. - [Friar] We are losing all our influence. And it's all because of him. - [Maldonado] Who does this man think he is? - [Friar] He's all the time alone with the nuns. The whole thing seems suspicious to me. - [Friar] I tell you, Father Maldonado, this man is dangerous. Something must be done! - [Teresa] Fray John, I need to speak to you. - [John] Madre Teresa. - [Teresa] Fray John, I am frightened. - You, Mother? What could frighten you? - (sighs) I'm not as brave as I look. (Teresa sighs) I've pulled you into this life, and I feel responsible for your wellbeing. - Yes, Mother. - There are friars in the order, Fray John, who will stop at nothing to kill the reform. - Yes, I know. God permits the devil to blind and delude many. - I fear for your very life, Fray John. They see that other friars are following you into the reform movement. I tell you, the war is on. - Mother, listen to me. We must try always to want not the easiest but the most difficult. Let us not choose a light burden. For the heavier the burden is, the lighter it becomes when we carry it for Christ. In silence and in hope shall our strength be. - So you embrace the cross, whatever that might mean? No regrets? - No regrets, Mother, only great joy and love. (vindictive music) - I have important news. Father Tostado, the visitor general of the order, will arrive here tomorrow to carry out the mandate of the general chapter. The reform will be suppressed. For neither Madre Teresa nor Father John of the Cross have received any authorization for what they do. Madre Teresa will be ordered to retire in one convent and not stir. She's a meddlesome and restless nun. And we all know that she has a long arm. But this Father John is different matter. He refuses to renounce the reform. Things have gotten out of control. The visitor general has ordered his immediate arrest and interrogation. I authorize you to carry out this injunction tonight. Use force if necessary. (troubled music) - [John] "In darkness and concealment", my house being now all stilled, "on that glad night in secret, for no one saw me, nor did I look at anything with no other light or guide "than the one that burned in my heart." (troubled music swells) (hinge squeaks) - [Soldier] Fray John of the Cross, you are under arrest, in the name of Father Maldonado. - Yes, I was expecting this. (footsteps clop) - [Maldonado] Father Tostado, this man is a disobedient, rebellious, and contumacious member of the Discalced Carmelites. By his arrogant pride, he censures his brothers. And by his extreme actions, he's instigating a movement among the friars that could destroy the very life of our order. (Tostado whispers) Well, Father John of the Cross, the visitor general is prepared to show compassion. After all, we are all brothers. I appeal to your sense of religious obedience. - Father Maldonado, I am simply doing what the Church and lawful authority have commissioned me to do. - What is the use of your resistance? We will stop you one way or another. You can be sure of that. But, Father John, we have been friends a long time. I have always admired your great mind. You have great potential, which you are wasting with Madre Teresa. You should use your talent to do good among your brothers. If you renounce the reform here and now, the visitor general is prepared to offer you the rank of prior. You shall have comfortable quarters and your own library. How do you answer, Fray John? (graceful music) - He who seeks Christ, stripped of all things, has no need of gold or jewels or honors. - Then you are confirmed in your error. Father John of the Cross, since you have refused due acceptance of these orders and letters, alleging in your excuse lies and fabrications, I declare you unworthy to hold office in the Carmelite Order. You will be held in solitary confinement until you renounce this rebellion. Strip him of his cowl and scapular. Take him away. - [Friar] Where shall we put him, Father Maldonado? - [Maldonado] I know the perfect place that will break his will, if nothing else can. You know that little room that adjoins the chamber upstairs? - [Friar] You mean the storeroom, Father? He'll go mad shut up in that airless tomb. - [Maldonado] Yes indeed, indeed. - [Guard] In here, priest. - [Maldonado] This stubborn brother will soon come to his senses. Bread and water only. (door creaks) (lock clunks) - [John] "This guided me more surely than the light of noon to where He waited for me, Him I knew so well, in a place where no one else appeared." (crickets chirp) - [Alonso] Eight months passed in that dark and stifling cell. But John never wavered. - "What more do you want, O soul? What else do you search for outside, when within yourself you possess your riches, delights, satisfactions, fullness, and kingdom... Your Beloved whom you desire and seek? "The Kingdom of God is within you." - Why do I bother with this pigheaded man? If he were to disappear, no one would ever know the difference. Should he ever leave here at all, it will only be for the cemetery. - "Be joyful and gladdened in your interior recollection with Him, O precious soul. For you have Him so close to you. Desire Him there. Adore Him there. Even though He does abide within you, He is hidden. Nevertheless, it is vital for you to know the place of His hiding "so that you may search for Him there with assuredness." - This man is a fool indicted as a rebel, not worthy of the name of Christian. He is a hypocrite of the worst kind. I know why he wishes to go barefoot and clad in a coarse habit... So that he might be venerated as a saint. - "Anyone who is to find a hidden treasure must enter the hiding place secretly, and once he has discovered it, he shall also be hidden just as the treasure is hidden. "In order to find Him, you should forget all your possessions and all creatures "and hide within the interior secret chamber of your spirit." - Who has sown the seeds of revolt in the order? Who is to blame for all of this? It is none other than John of the Cross, a wretched little friar who has plunged us all into trouble and disunity. - "Come, then, oh beautiful soul. Since you know now that your desired Beloved lives hidden in your heart, strive to be really hidden with Him, and you will embrace Him within you "and experience Him with loving affection." - Sister, in the face of so many enemies, I have found it impossible to sit with my hands folded. I've gone to all the authorities. But no one can give me any idea of his whereabouts. It's as if he's fallen off the edge of the earth. Fray John of the Cross is a saint, a treasure who must be returned immediately. (sighs) Dear Lord, you treat your friends so terribly at times. It's no wonder you have so few. - During these trying months, God, in his secret way, converted the most inactive period of John's life into the most intense. He was able to make friends with his kind jailer, who took pity on his miserable circumstances and gave him some paper and ink. (companionable music) And so it was there in that prison cell that John composed some of the most sublime and mystical poetry ever written. ♪ My Beloved, the mountains ♪ ♪ And lonely wooded valleys, strange islands ♪ ♪ And resounding rivers ♪ ♪ The whistling of love-stirring breezes ♪ (companionable music continues) ♪ The tranquil night ♪ ♪ At the time of the rising dawn ♪ ♪ Silent music ♪ ♪ Sounding solitude ♪ ♪ The supper that refreshes and deepens love ♪ - Oh Beloved Jesus, if I am destined to die here, Thy will be done. But, if you want me to escape, inspire me. (lock rattles) (footsteps clack) (rosary beads click) (fretful music) (lock clunks) (door creaks) - Why don't you arise when I come in to see you? Get up, Fray John of the Cross. - Excuse me, your Reverence, it is with great difficultly that I rise now, for I am very weak. - You will die in this foul tomb if you continue your obstinacy. This has gone on far too long. (irritated music) I don't understand you. What are you thinking, Fray John? - I was thinking that tomorrow is Our Lady's Feast of the Assumption. And you must know how I must feel. I would be very happy, Father. If I might be able to say Mass. - Not while I'm here. (imperious music continues) Unless you repent, you will never say Mass again. Guard, secure the door. (affectionate music) - [John] "One dark night", fired with love's urgent longings, ah, the sheer grace, I went out unseen, my house being now all stilled. "Oh guiding night, oh night more lovely than the dawn, oh night that has united the lover with his beloved, transforming the beloved in her lover. "Upon my heart, which I had kept holy for him alone, there he lay sleeping and I caressing him. There in a breeze from the fanning cedars. When the breeze blew from the fortress wall, parting his hair, he wounded my neck with his gentle hand, suspending all my senses. "I abandoned and forgot myself, laying my face on my beloved. All things ceased. I went out for myself, "leaving my cares forgotten among the lilies." - [Nun] Mother, there's a man at the gate. He says he's a friar, but he's dressed in rags. I tried to turn him away. But he insists on seeing you. - Very well, I will see him. (troubled music) Fray John of the Cross, what have they done to you? - [John] Dear Madre Teresa, I have escaped this night from prison. - (gasps) Oh thanks be to God. But are you being followed? Do they know where you are? - [John] They soon will, Madre. - [Teresa] Sister, we must hide Fray John of the Cross in the cleaning room. Hurry now. - [Nun] Yes, Mother. (door raps) (door squeals) - Deo Gracias. - Madre Teresa, we have urgent business. Is, by chance, Fray John of the Cross here? - (scoffs) Your Reverence, it would be a miracle if you were to find any friar here. - Are you sure, Madre, absolutely sure? - Yes, Father. - Let us go. Our business here is finished. (aching music) - [Alonso] John would have to leave the monastery. For only in a distant part of the country could he hope to be safe from the long reach of the calced friars. And so, on the morning of his departure, he spoke to Madre Teresa and the sisters. - My daughters in Christ, did not the Messiah, the Word of God, our Beloved, have to undergo all these things so as to enter into his glory? Sisters, I confess that never in my life have I felt such contentment nor enjoyed such an abundance of supernatural light and sweetness as during my imprisonment. The calced friars are indeed my great benefactors. Oh sisters, he that seeks not the Cross of Christ seeks not the glory of Christ. Love consists not in feeling great things but in having great detachment and in suffering for the Beloved. Oh my daughters, let Christ crucified be sufficient for you. And with Him suffer and take your rest. Be strong in your heart against all things that move you to that which is not God. And for Christ's sake love suffering. ♪ Who ne'er had met with pain ♪ ♪ Within this vale of tears ♪ ♪ Knows naught of higher joy ♪ ♪ Knows naught, knows naught ♪ ♪ Knows naught of higher joy ♪ ♪ Knows naught of love ♪ ♪ Knows naught, knows naught ♪ ♪ Knows naught, indeed, of love ♪ ♪ For on pain's path, ♪ ♪ Pain's path, pain's path ♪ ♪ Are formed the hearts of lovers ♪ ♪ Lovers, on pain's path ♪ ♪ Pain's path, are formed the hearts of lovers ♪ ♪ Lovers, of lovers ♪ - [Alonso] As the sisters gazed at him silently, his body was raised above the ground. He stayed there for an hour of high prayer. (resolute music continues) When he finally returned to Earth, he said goodbye to the sisters and started on his way. - [John] "Let us rejoice, Beloved", and let us go to see ourselves in your beauty to the mountain, to the hill, to where the pure water flows, and, further, deep into the thicket. And then we will go on to the high caverns in the rock which are so well concealed. There we shall enter and taste the fresh juice of the pomegranates. There you will show me what my soul has been seeking, and then you will give me, you, my Life, will give me there what you gave me on that other day, the breathing of the air, the song of the sweet nightingale, the grove and its living beauty in the serene night "with a flame that is consuming and painless." (intrepid music) (touching music) (companionable music)
