This is a first! Women's mixed martial arts and this is certainly an historic match-up. You know, most people think women shouldn't even be boxing. Should women be in the cage? Let 'em fight, man. If you don't think women can fight, I'm calling BS. You missed this fight. It's... time! The judges are here. The fighters are ready! And there she goes again, right on that arm. That is over! It is over! The fight is over! She's holding on. Scrambling to survive! Thirty seconds in and Justice is taking a beating. Watch your ass, yo! She does not look like a ten-and-oh fighter tonight. Get up! Justice is jumping out of the cage! I've never seen this before! The Pretty Bull is done! What the fuck are you doing? Get up there! What's the matter with you? Are... Are you filming me again, boy? - Give me that phone. - No. I ain't playing with you, boy. Gimme that phone. - Fuck you! - Fuck me? - Are you deaf? Fuck you! - Oh, really? Fuck you! And your phone! How about that? Oh, God. Oh God. Come on, Edgar. I'm sorry. Come on, let me help you up. You are so fucking fired. Oh... Oh, God. I'm fucking fired. Hello? Jackie, what is it? What's going on? Edgar? And my son, he married a man. That boy is a snack. Yo, check it, check it. That's Jackie Justice, right? What? Boy, you trippin'. Nah. For real. Yo, bro. She used to be... thick. Like, fuck, bro. And famous. - Bro. - Yo, yo, miss? You used to be thick and famous? - Look at this shit, bro. - Oh, shit! - Yo, bro. - Yeah! Yo, miss, this is you getting served? So, this is why you quit, huh? - Jackie! - Yo! What did I say? What's the matter with you guys? You jerks! - I thought you was nice though. - What are you saying? Sit. Go on, sit down. Hey, Jacqueline, I want you to take a good look at my neck area right here. All right? I want you to tell me what's missing. Your chin? - Sorry... - What's missing from my neck, Jacqueline, is my 14-karat Golden Gloves pendant. That I'll have to hock for cash to pay your now-former employer and beg her not to press charges on you for assaulting a kid and destroying his phone. The fuck's the matter with you? You're assaulting kids, now? Is that really necessary? That was super necessary. Goddamn it, I can't take this shit no more, Jackie. Just get back in the fucking ring already. - That ain't gonna happen. - Hey. Listen to me, all right? You were born to fight. Born to fight. I mean, that shit was God-given. What do you do instead? You... you wanna fucking fight me. Fight yourself, co√±o. You beat the shit out of a kid. 'Cause I don't wanna fight! How many fucking times I gotta tell you that? I'm happy! - You're happy. - Yeah. You're happy scrubbing toilets for snobby rich-ass motherfuckers? That fulfills your fucking purpose? I threw away all my fighters to focus on managing you. And what do you manage to do instead? You pussied the fuck out, left me holding the fucking bag. I'mma tell you why you ain't got no fucking fighters. - Why? - You know why? - Why? - Because you're a lousy-ass manager! That's why. You're a fucking drunk, - that couldn't manage a popsicle stand. - That's what you fucking think? You're a part-time limo driver and a full-time loser! - That's what you are! - Fuck you! The fuck's the matter with you? That's what you think about me? Go ahead, do it. Go ahead. Hit me. You want me to fucking hit you? I'm gonna fucking hit you right now. - Go ahead! Do it! - I'll fucking hit you right now! Why are you doing this, baby? Why you doing this? You disrespectin' my intentions, mija. Come here. I fucking love you, baby. I fucking love you.

That baby, the one you dumped on his dad? Yeah, well his daddy died. Guess who got a knock on her door, saying, "Meet your grandson"? Who fucking brought him? The so-called girlfriend. Some young Cuban chick. Flew him up from Miami and brought his ass to me 'cause she don't have no address. - What do you mean the father died? - Bullet to the head. She told me Manny Sr. worked undercover and he got got. Little Manny here witnessed it, but he ain't talkin'. What the fuck's that mean, he ain't talking? Not talking.

I got five other girls, all stronger, faster, younger. And none of them ever did what she did in a fight that big. Yeah, 'cause none of 'em ever been in a fight that big, or fought in the UFC. Jackie, she was killing game in the UFC... Yo, blow the whistle for me real quick. Come on, blow it. Yo, Karima. Come here. Listen up. You got what it takes. You hearin' me?

So, look, Manny, did your father say anything about me to you? He didn't say nothing? Nothing at all? Did... did he tell you that I died? Come on, let's go. Come on. I'm only gonna say this once. I want you here every day on time. I ain't asking for 100%. I want 250. You got any excuses, you give them to me now. All right? Yep. First day back at school is always a bastard! Come on! Pick it up! Aah! You don't look like no UFC, Justice! And five seconds! Four! Three! Two! You okay? Jackie. You okay? Yeah? You know better than that. Don't you ever not protect yourself in my ring again. Do you hear me? You hear me? Yeah. Okay, you're done, Betty White! Betty White ain't no slouch. You can never miss an opportunity to level change. When you're up close, that's your chance. Mix it up. Level the playing field. 'Cause if you don't level it, eventually she's going to level you. - Do you hear me? - Yep. I tried to make you quit. But you just wouldn't die, would you? Just got a kid. Oh, shit. Newborn? Six. Adopted? Nope. Mine. But that's a long story. I'm gonna have to tell you that another time. I do gotta get him in school, though. - You know how to do that? - Yeah. Just get his report cards, birth certificate, that stuff. It's pretty straightforward. How you know all that? You got a kid? Short story. I'll tell you another time. You need that paperwork. Okay. And it's Bobbi. My real name. What do you need his papers for? He's a citizen. - He don't need no damn papers. - Angel. Look. That lady had to give you some papers. No, I don't know nothing about that. Ma, what'd you do with the boy's papers? Angel! Where'd you put the papers? Oven. - Yeah. - What? - Why would you put his papers in the oven? - Oven don't work. - Oh, Lord! - I puts my things in there. Thieves, burglars and junkies, ain't none of them clever enough to look in the damn oven. Right, kiddo? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look here. Lookie here. Let me see something. Let me see this. Oh. Ooh! Lookie here. Boy, you look like a little girl. That's your color, too. Little Manuela. - Come on. Go see in the mirror. - Mama, really? - He look cute. - Come on, let's go, Manny. Shit. You don't know nothing. - You sticking with water today, Miss J? - Mm-hm. Thank you. Go ahead. Eat your food. Go ahead. Eat it. You gotta eat. Okay. So, you ain't talking. And I guess now you ain't eating. Look, I know you don't know me. And guess what? I don't know you either. We strangers right now. But what I do know is you're gonna have to eat and you're gonna have to start talking. 'Cause I'm all you got. Birth certificate, social security... - Immunization. - Manny. Mm. These look good. We'll process his documents and get him started soon. No, I gotta get him in here today. Oh, that's not how this works, ma'am. It's a process. Okay, but... Manny! I can't keep taking him with me, though. Does he have trouble with communication? Is he special needs? Uh-uh. No, no, no. It's the first day, you know? He's just... All right. I'll push this through. Come back here tomorrow and have his school supplies... Manny! Oh, y'all think that's funny? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This ain't never gonna happen again. Stop. Immaculate's here. Now, go get geared up. I'll bring little man in for a while. And make sure he gets home safe. Young man. My name is Buddhakan and you're gonna come with me. Yeah, hands off. Let's go! What's that you got there? There you go! Yeah. Go! Knock her ass out, boy. Come on, Justice. Come on. Get strong. Hit, hit. Come on, right there. Ah! All right, come on. Come on. Get it, get it, get it. Come on! Your mum is a good fighter. Come on. Boom! There you go! Kick him again. Come on. Kick him. Boom! You didn't know she fought, did you? Keep that guard up. I think she's pretty cool. What do you think? Nice. I can teach you some cool stuff, too. Boom! - Like how to have special powers. - Move! Keep moving! Would you like that? You soft, man! You soft! Okay. How about we go to the park? There you go! You like the park, don't you? Boom! Ah! Get him, Justice! Go! Om tare tuttare ture swaha. Om tare tuttare ture swaha. Om tare tuttare ture swaha. Om tare tuttare ture swaha. Om tare tuttare ture swaha. Feels good, don't it? So now, if you need a place to go that's all on your own you can chant a little. One more thing. If you ever get scared just raise your arms up all the way. And breathe. I did 15 years for second-degree murder when I was 16 years old and that was just for the body they caught me on. Yeah, you know I was affiliated. So they was right to put me away. You feel me? But you? You was in Spofford as a juvenile, right? - Yep. - Yeah. You know, when I got out, a man gave me a second chance, Jackie. A few years later. I'm sitting here with you. Offering you a chance. To fight for the flyweight championship belt against Lady Killer on January 24th. A title fight? Ten K, just to show up. Twenty K if you win. It's gonna be televised. Nationally. Listen, a lot of people, man, they saw what you did in the UFC. Hey, you was bad bitch then. Damn! But that was, what, four years ago or some shit? Yeah. Well, now... this is your shot, Jackie. This is your shot to show the UFC, to show all of them the real Jackie Justice, you feel me? You gonna take it? - A title fight? - Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm gonna take it. Come on. Say it with your chest. Yeah. Yeah. - You have to call my manager, though. - Ah. - Desi DeMarco. - No, no, no, no. Listen. If I sign you, it's going to be exclusive. It can't be no other way. Okay? - No, no. He's more than my manager. - You want Desi or a title fight? Listen, I get it. He's your boyfriend. Just let him be that for you then. No, look. He dropped all his fighters for me. - Jackie, Jackie. - Okay? Listen... Jackie! Come on, Jackie, stop this, okay? You were ten-and-oh. On track for a title fight. Then your mans got desperate and threw you in a match you weren't even close to being ready for and you became a joke. Yeah, you, Jackie. You. Look, I get it. To his face, I'll always be respectful, that I promise you. But your man's incompetent, Jackie. And this is why he has no other fighters. And everyone knows it. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I bet you haven't slept good in the past four years, huh? I know. So maybe this is your shot for you to lay your head down at night... ...on your pillow with dignity again. Dignity, Jackie. And maybe a championship belt. Who the hell are you? Okay. Well, you must be Desi. I'm Jackie's lead trainer. You're the Buddhakan? - Look. I'm just helping her with Manny. - Mm. She had to talk to Immaculate. He... he came to see her? That asshole not realize I'm her fucking manager? - Look... - I'm her fucking manager. I'll check on you later. - You fucking serious right now? - Okay, little man? Get in the house. - What's up, mama? - All right, you good? I'm good. Hey, where you been? I was picking up something for Manny. Where's he at? He locked his ass in the bathroom. What the fuck is that? Okay. Did you feed him? Yeah. I fed him. I gave him a hot dog, he threw it away. Kid's getting on my last nerve. Manny. Open the door. It's me. Come on. - See that? - Wait. Wait. See what I've been dealing with all day? Silent Sam's a fucking terrorist. Hey! You want me to toss you outta here? Go make yourself invisible! I don't wanna know you're here! - Why you talking to him like that? - What? Come on. He's a kid. I've been sending you texts all day... What do you want me to do? Kneel down and pray you get back? I don't care what you do, but get off your ass and do somethin'. That's why I signed today, that's exactly why I signed. - You signed? - Yeah. What did you sign, Jackie? How could you sign anything without me? Because, I'm grown. You don't tell me what to do! Is that what you're gonna do? What's going on here? That's what I mean. Everything's about you. What about me? This is why I don't tell you shit. It's why I don't tell you nothin'. Start tellin' me somethin'. From the beginning, I've been tellin' you, communicate with me, don't just do your own thing! I don't, 'cause when something good happens to me, you piss on it. What are you talking about? Things good happen to you all the time with me. What? The whole time you were with me, good things were happening. Nothing was good for me. I was getting no fights. Nothing good. I need to talk to that promoter. Then call him, you're my manager. You listening to this bitch, Buddhakan... Why's she gotta be a bitch? I'm tired of you talking about women like that! What the fuck is wrong with you? You, your mother, father and everybody in your goddamn family. Okay, I had to leave. And then you go involving them. It's everything your way. It's always gotta be... - What the fuck? - Oh, shit! Ah! Fucking...! Mother... Shit! Oh, goddamn it! Fuck! Ugh. Goddamn it! - Fuck. - You fucking... Hey! He cleans this up! All right? Look at me, Manny. I'm not gonna let that man hurt you. Okay? I'm Big and you're Little. And Big protects Little. Okay? You hear me? Okay, now that keyboard in there, that's just for you.

She the real deal. We just gotta study some of her footage. Your real power is in grappling. If you can get her to the ground, you're in with a chance. Question is, what are you gonna do if she stays standing? Yeah, that's a good question. I'll tell you what. I'll come over later and we'll watch some videos, yeah? Okay. You know, Jack. You could have taken that girl that night, if you'd stayed with it. I mean brutal, brutal first round. But you could have taken her. Oh, what's up with little man? He start school? Oh, shit.

No one decides to become all zen and practice meditation and all that 'cause they did everything right. - Here you go. - Thank you. Yes. Listen. About your mother. You're off your game because of your history with her. Now, if its historical, it's hysterical. And if you're hysterical, and getting all worked up she's gonna wipe the floor with you.

You know exactly what that mean, Mama. I think you talking some Jackie bullshit. Really? I don't know why I came back here, Mama. 'Cause you still exactly the same. Oh, you came back here for free rent, free childcare, free everything. Oh. Well, watch how fast I get my ass up out of here. All right. Get on up out of here then. Fast, too. Okay. You know, something? I spoiled you as a child. - Yeah, gave you everything. - You spoiled me? You destroyed me. And you wasn't no damn mama. No mama? Really? Who birthed you? Raised you? Kept a motherfucking roof over your head? Oh. I had a motherfucking roof over my head. But what I needed was a goddamn lock on my bedroom door. - Lock? For what? - You know damn well for what. Okay, you see, you was always one for making stories. Tell me, what kind of bullshit you serving today? Oh. You know what the question is? What kind of bullshit was you serving to yourself when your baby girl was back there in that room being raped. - Raped? - Raped. By all your boyfriends coming in and out of that room. And your nasty-ass brother Dexter too. - Dexter paid the rent! - No, I paid the rent! - With my ass, my mouth, my private parts. - Liar! - Don't talk about your uncle. - You a liar. You knew. I know you knew. I will... If you put your fucking hands on me...! Uh... You know something? That's a lie. That's a lie. You been lyin' to yourself all your life. You are going straight to hell, bitch! Come on, Manny. Let's go. - Wait a minute. - You lyin' to yourself. You don't have to take him. All right? Wait, okay, look, Jackie, if something happened to you and I was unawares, I mean... Don't you think I would've capped a nigga if you had just told me? What you think I kept a .22 under my bed for? Decoration? Wait a minute, Jackie. Stop! Wait, Jackie! Okay, go ahead! Run on! Run on! Do the Jackie! Oh. You can't sleep? Huh? That's my fight card. You like that? You could keep it. What? What? Say it. Say it, Manny. You scared? I used to be scared when I was little, too. And sometimes I'm still scared. But Big is gonna be okay. Here. I want you to keep it. Okay, now go for a spin escape. Steer. Okay, take five. Then we'll go again. Who the fuck you think you are? Missing a day of training in my gym for my motherfucking title belt. Huh? This ain't just your shot, Jackie. This is my fucking shot. And all I need from you is to last three rounds and make it look good. Because you ain't even in Lady Killer's class. But you won't even last 30 seconds if you miss a day of training, you get me? - You get me? - Oh, yeah. So that's what I am? - Yeah. - I'm just a tomato can? Oh, you hope to live to even be that. Manny. Manny, Manny, look. Go back to the table, okay? I'm going to the bathroom for one minute. I'll be fine, but go sit over there and wait for me. Oh, God. Oh, God. - Hello? - I'm in here! Fuck off! Manny! Manny! Manny! Hello! Hey! Have you seen the little kid I always come in here with? No? - Is he here? - He's sleeping. Yeah. Mama, mama, wait. He was sitting outside the movie theater at 11 p.m. Some woman saw him and brought him here. Boy had my napkin in his pocket. - I'm taking custody now. - Wait, hol... What? You homeless, and you ain't fit. Yeah, but I'm his mother. Manny. You know I didn't mean that, right? That... That was a mistake. You really need to get your shit together. Mama, I'm trying to do that. I'm a fighter. Well, you ain't a mother, that's for certain. Manny's staying here. And if you fuck with me, I'll call Child Services. I'm sorry, Little. Did you sleep here or something? I've been texting you all night. - She took him. - What? Angel. She took Manny. I had to leave him. Okay, Jack. We're gonna win this fight, yeah? Yeah. Fuck Immaculate. Let him throw you in as a can. That's fine. Our best revenge is we shock the world, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, let's go! Yeah! Cross, hook, cross. - Come on. - Ha! - That's it! - Jab, cross, hook. Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! And down. That's it, yes. That's it. I got something for you. Where did Pretty Bull come from? My daddy. Last time I saw him. He said... "See you later, pretty bull." I was five years old. Are you scared? Yeah. You wanna know why I jumped the cage? 'Cause it was my first fight after I left Manny. Yeah, I guessed. I saw his little face. And I got scared. So I ran. And then I got to Vegas. And I got scared again. So I ran. I ran. Like I always do. Yeah. You ain't a coward, Jack. Never was. What, you think you deserved to lose in Vegas? You grew up with damage and survived on rage, and that rage carried you into the ring. With all that rage turned inward your greatest weapon was pointing right back at you. But that was then. So, what you gonna do now? Mm? Point that cannon back at yourself? Or point it at Lady Killer? Show 'em what you're made of, and get some money 'cause you deserve that. You deserve every good thing in this world. Oof. Ah! Ah! Nearly there. Nearly there, Jack. You just gotta make that weight, then you can get in that ring. Ah! - Whatever you gotta do. Let it out. - Ice. I need ice. Give her some ice. That's it. I know. I know. I love the sea. Just makes everything feel... new. I could live here, you know? I could. We could live here. You're the most... beautiful person I've ever met. Nobody... has ever made me feel like you do. That's good. But... I gotta figure my life out. I thought that's... That's what you been doing. That's exactly what you've been doing. Yeah. But I gotta do it alone. By myself. For myself. For my son. Why can't we do that together? 'Cause I'm not ready for a new relationship. I'm just... I'm not ready. So why did you do this? Wh... Because I needed to. You know how many times I've been intimate with one of my fighters? I'm sorry. It's time to go. Where's she at? Bobbi's not here. Look, I think it's crazy. Okay? I think it's crazy she ain't here. But, look, Jack. It's go time. You got to get in there and get this thing done. You've got a plan. Now it's your job to go out there and execute it. - I'm in it to win it. How about you? - Yeah. All right. Well go out there and be Jackie Justice. And... wear this. What the hell is that? That place you go to off Waldo's Avenue. They stepping' up to be your sponsor. Say they'll take care of your food tab. I gotta wear this shit? Fuck it, it's a hat. Wear the hat. Come on. Jackie Justice is back, four years after her last walk to the cage and, Jules, you know, the rule: you never tap from strikes, right? When she approached that line, she didn't just cross it. She leapt over it. You know, Yves, four years off, I don't know. Some people talk about ring rest, but, I mean, you can hit mitts, you can spar all you want, but once you're back in that cage, back in that cage, mm... It's a whole different ball game. Go. Lucia "the Lady Killer" Chavez is ready to defend this belt one more time. She earned it with a perfect record, 18-and-oh taking everybody out within the distance. With the pace and power that the Lady Killer brings I think the only thing Jackie can do is to get her on the ground quickly. She's gonna have to if she wants to get herself a W. I can't wait to see this fight. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and once again welcome. This is your main event of the evening! Five rounds for the Invicta FC Flyweight Championship of the World! And now, live from Boardwalk Hall here in Atlantic City, ladies and gentlemen, it's go time! Introducing first, the challenger. Fighting out of the blue corner. She weighed in at the flyweight limit, 125 pounds. Her impressive professional record consists of ten victories against one defeat. She wears black trimmed with blue and represents the Brick City, Newark, New Jersey! Ladies and gentlemen, Jackie "Pretty Bull" Justice! And her opponent, fighting out of the red corner. She weighed in at an even and ready 125 pounds. She is undefeated as a professional. 18 bouts, 18 victories. She wears green this evening and hails from Argentina. Now living and training out of the fighting city of Philadelphia. Please welcome the reigning, defending flyweight champion of the world, Lucia "Lady Killer" Chavez! And here for the final instructions, the referee in charge, Keith Peterson. Once I've given the instructions, follow my commands at all times. Touch gloves, if you like. Let's fight. You won't last 30 motherfucking seconds - Ma'am, are you ready? - Turn around! Turn around! - Turn around! - Fight! Oh! Why wasn't she paying attention? - Ah! - Oh, another big shot. Justice's gotta keep her hands up. She's gotta move her head. Oh! Nice shot. A malicious head kick. A creative way of getting out of it. She might wanna stay down there. You can't get kicked in the head when you're on the ground. Justice has gotta time one of those kicks and set up her shot. She's gotta get to the inside. Southside is not working for her. Oh, my God. That body shot. Jeez. She's just starting to pick Justice apart. Oh, my goodness. She is unloading on her. I love ending on a leg kick like that. Nice shot there by Justice. Shake it off. Shake it off. That's it, don't wait for it! Ooh! Nice front kick to end the round. Time! Is she out on her feet? It looked like she was. Lady Killer almost had herself a victory. What you doing? I told you we not watching that. Go to bed. She has a minute to recover. Can she come back in the second round? If she does, that tells me that she's been in the trench and working on her game. If this is the woman that won ten fights in a row that woman can do it. The woman that jumped out of the cage? I don't think so. Listen to me, Jack. You got to get it to the ground. That's your home. You want to be here? Let me see you look like you want to be here! Let's go! Good. Ah! Ma'am, are you ready? Ma'am, are you ready? Fight. If Justice is gonna last another round, she's gotta change the game. That was a dominant first round by Lady Killer. - Takedown attempt! - That was a horrible shot. Stand up. Stand up. Fight. Lady Killer just likes to pick apart the body, get those hands down and then take the head off. - Another double-leg attack! - That was perfect timing. To the ground! Justice's got the timing down. Now can she control right here? Beautiful side-control position. Looking to get to the mount! - She's there with the mount! - Full mount! Get mad. Get mad. Get mad. Beautiful arm bar attempt. The champ's rolling, trying to get that off and elbows out. She's free! Big shots there from the champion. Beautiful up-kick! Good! There you go. That really hurt the champ. Great head movement by Justice. She's starting to get the champ's timing down. Look at her work. But she's getting tagged. She's just teeing off on her now. Oh! Big shot! She pissed the champ off. You can see that. That's not a woman I want pissed off with me. Payback is a dish best served on your feet! These leg kicks are doing some serious damage. Time! Justice is gonna have a hard time sitting on that stool. For those of you thinking leg kicks don't win fights, you've never been leg-kicked. - Manny, shut the door! - Jackie needs to step it up. - Shut the door! - It's out there... Why she's not out yet? Listen to me. Look at me, Jack. Gotta get her to the ground. That's your home. You feel me? You want to fight? You want to be here? Let me see you look like you wanna be here. Let's go! After those leg kicks, let's see what Jackie's got left in her. Lady Killer's doing the same thing. Getting back to what got her to... Oh! Catch of the kick! Nicely done there by Jackie. This is what Justice needs to do, she needs to control these top positions. Back up on the fence! Lady Kill... Oh! She's got Lady Killer down again into side-control. Hold her down. Hold her down. She's hit some beautiful takedowns, but she's gotta cover. - Watch the head. - She has to score with these takedowns. Nice ground and pound, but she should've held onto that. Oof! Good escape by Justice there. Big swing and a miss! To the ground! To the ground! Justice is trying for that double-leg again! Wait a minute! Wait. Beautiful tackle! - Hold her down. - Nice reversal by Justice. - Yves, this is getting exciting. - Looking for an arm bar. This is the Jiu-Jitsu I was talking about. She's got to get her hooks in to sink that in properly. She's almost there in the rear naked. Oh, my goodness. Oh! Oh! Back up on the fence! Big knee to Justice. Lady Killer is still in this. Turn her into the fence. - Look at Justice, making the turn... - Good! Good! There you go! She may be beaten. She's not done. Another double-leg from Justice! You got her. You got her, Jack. A big ground and pound from the contender. Big punches from the top. And Justice is now pouring it on. She hops on the back! Standing! This rear naked is in! You got it. You got it. - She has it! - Her hooks are in! - That choke is in. It's tight! - This could be it! Time! Oh, saved by the bell! Damn! If Justice had just ten more seconds I believe we would be looking at a new Invicta champion right now. This is insane. Sit. Look at me. Breathe. Look at me. Breathe. You almost had her. Now keep her on the ground, that's where you're strong. - You got it? - Yeah! All right. Yeah. That's it! Good. Let's go. Finish her! Fight! Championship rounds for Chavez. She's never been here before. Can she dig deep, or is she gonna be too flustered? Big throw! For a champion never having gone to this round, she's doing pretty well. She's mounted now. Reverse it! Not anymore! Good reversal by Justice. Justice is on top, working for a pass. This is where Jackie shines. She knows where to get those hooks. She knows where to sink things in. Justice has got the timing down. Now can she control right here? Lock her! Lock her up! Oh! Lady Killer out! Beautiful scramble here by Lady Killer. She got back to that top position. Look at Justice. She's working for a single from the bottom. Lady Killer looks for a knee bar, but no! That scramble was crazy beautiful! What a sweep! She should've done an omoplata right there. Now they're back on their feet! You can see the champion's angry! Another hook! - Just teeing off there now. - Champ's going to work. See what happens when you make the Lady Killer angry! - Oh! Elbow! - Oh! And she's bleeding! That cut can change the rest of this fight. - Nice duck. - She slips outside... Wow! - Beautiful takedown! - Big slam! Look at her. Contender's on top, landing punch... Knee bar attempt! Wait. She's switching to the heel hook! Inside heel hook! That's nasty. Time! - Great round. Great fight. - Unbelievable! Can you believe what we're seeing outta Jackie Justice? This is a championship fight. Four years out of the cage to come back and bring this level to the table. Yeah, yeah. I'm really impressed with this woman tonight. This is the final round. You see what you can do? Go out there and light her ass up. Yeah? Yeah, I see it. I see it. Now this fight is all about conditioning. This is about who put in more work in the gym and who wants it more. Ma'am, are you ready? Ma'am are you ready? Fight. Whoa! Lady Killer wants a takedown. That's what she wants. We didn't see this earlier tonight. She wanted to keep this fight standing. She's looking for this triangle. And that's deep. Lady Killer's gotta get her head up, butt down. Lock her up. Lock her up. She's got the legs up. Get it all tight! Justice may be the new champ if she can just pull on that head! Look. She's doing what she needs to do! That posture! Almost out. Oh, nice! Beautiful defense. She got herself outta that bad spot. But how much does she have left in the tank? - That's the question. - She looks exhausted. This is where heart shows. This is high-level MMA right here. Fifth round, showing technique showing heart. Ah! Come on! Take it home. Take it home. Ah! Time! Ladies and gentlemen, having gone all five championship rounds here at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, we now go to the scorecards. The judges score this contest: 48-47, Chavez, 48-47, Justice and 48-47 for your winner by split decision and still Invicta FC Flyweight Champion of the World Lucia "Lady Killer" Chavez! Gracias, Jackie. It was an honor for me to share the octagon with you. Good fight. Good fight. Good grappling! Aaah! Justice! We love you, Justice! Jackie! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice, Justice! Yeah! Justice is being served some love by this Boardwalk crowd tonight. Yeah. Man, we may have a champion in name but we've got a champion in heart on the other side. Justice is the people's champion tonight. What happened to you? Long story. Very long story. You stayed in there, Jack. You didn't need me at that fight. I mean, I wish I had chosen another way to prove it to you 'cause this shit fucking hurts. But... you had it all in you. Ugh! I said this shit hurts. So how's he doing? Still ain't said one word. I'm okay. Big is okay. You were with me, Manny. Little helped Big. And I'm okay. I mean, I'm a little... I'm a little bruised up. But I'm good. And I'mma get us an apartment. For Big and for Little. If that's what you want. And... I ain't never wanted nothin' more in my whole life. So? I know I got a lot... I know I got a lot I gotta prove to you. If you give me a chance. Manny, come here, baby. Come here. Where did you put those sneakers? Hm? You remember where you put 'em? All right. Let's put 'em on. All right? There you go. Come on, sit down, let's get 'em on. There you go. Let's get our coat. All right? There. Whoa. You know where we're goin', Manny? Me neither. And it's okay. We gonna figure it out. What? Oh. Okay. Let me tie these shoelaces. You'll fall on these. Thank you, Big.
