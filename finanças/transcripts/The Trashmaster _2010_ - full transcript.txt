My grandfather always told me respect the trashman he's as human as you are even if he lives in a trash, you don't have to think of him as a trash If one day he stopped working city would disappear under a mountain of trash so respect the trashman as for me i prefer to call'em... the trashmaster request for emergency service Godamn, Niko! Where the f**k are you? garbage don't wait Sorry Boss, i'm on my way! an officer on the ground! to mister anybody, i'm the one who collects the garbage For others, such as that guy dying over there i'm the one that shouldn't be angried when the police failed do their job. New York nine million people in the city eighteen million people in all suburbs Every day they produce 35 thousand tons of waste but there is a type of shit statistics do not take into account Robbers drug dealers killers rapists this is where i come in once the small binger collected i'm large ones On the job i'm lowering the crime rates. the corpse here will trashed on there and i'm after the recycler center thanks to me, the grass of Central Park is always green. The hardest part of all this is when you return to the depo you have to explain to your boss why you're late How can you justify the bullet holes the punctured tyres and how can you justify the damage to the truck's bodywork. shootout? robbery? wrong place at the wrong time When New York goes to sleep i wake up when New York closes his eyes i keep mine open because behind the pictures, postcards, luxury ads neon lights of time square and zero tolerance the reality is another pair of gloves Hey, it's me. I'm waiting for more than one hour. Where the f**k are you? I'm leaving the restaurant... So, when you get this message call me back. Hey, it's me again. Finally, gonna get my car don't try call me back, a**hole. as a kid i dreamt to be a cop Not this kind of cop more like this kind A dustman who works a lot makes a good living Night premium health premium risk premium me? i'm poor. 'cause the little money i earn keep to my boss to repair the truck being a trashman's really special job you could be pricked by a contaminated needle one day and stumble on a winning lottery ticket the next. A while ago a colleague of mine have found a bomb Unfortunately, he's no longer here and talk about it Life of vigilaniance not pushover neither I remeber one day i lost my wreck on a car of a guy who'd been bothering girls from the club as a result i spent a week in hospital That f**ker pierced the tyres of my car a month later we settled the matter in the very same hospital the bastard was so drunk he ended up in the arch in the ethanol coma. very easy for me In a perfect life i'm gettin' out of my police car before shooting in an ideal world... i would wake up early, take the car at 7 am i go via the bridge to avoid the traffic 7.30 i'd be in i'd had enough time to have a coffee at 8 a.m. i'd be in a police building smiling to the secretairy ready to hear welcome to the police, mister Bellic! in an ideal world, i'd be a cop. I took the police examination three times i failed three times that's why i am what i am Hey Niko, it's me! Should i call you inspector? I ain't worth it, Boss. I failed... Ok, be at 9 am Every day we pick up tons of garbage... ... sometimes i wish there's no more trash on the streets... but waste always comes back with practice you get used to it. Korean garbage's full of computer stuff Chinese's full of coriandre and fish Starbuck's garbage smells of coffee and chocolate Poor people's garbage's been always full of trash where's rich people's garbage is always near empty well lined up recycled. Definitely i prefer the smell of hooker's garbage i'll let you know why Exceptionally today there's is a trash that i won't pick up Nice trouch! Please, have a drink on the house What i didn't tell the police is that i knew the victim She was the former strip-tease dancer How do i know about her? I've spent every night at the club for the last three years Last night another girl was found dead in the street near to Time Square having been stabbed to death in the same way another woman in previous night police officers have stated the possibility of a serial killer being at large First victim Mary was stabbed in the parking lot nearby and trown like a garbage in the street. The same morning police recovered the victim's car. the poor man's wheel set no place in this parking lot Only SUV and powerful expensive motors are allowed Mary leaves her home takes her car and drives towards the club She doesn't find her usual spot She calls a friend to warn her she'll be late she finds an expensive place to park instead she runs to a club because she made herself late going through places where a pretty girl shouldn't be goin' she enters the club dances for six hours in a row to raise a few bucks exhausted, she reaches for her car as got all of luck to be followed by some deranged weirdo i meet the parking guard unfortunately he saw nothing when Mary was killed he was waiting for his daily ration of nuggets One client called she wanted him to remove a crappy car the guard refused to do it a few bucks is giving me number and address of that client a plush woman who lives in the hamptons I asked her if she saw something the other night in the park She sorried, but has not seen or heard anything The secondary girl was stabbed in so much violence that the knife left marks on the ground But killer is strong he loves to see them suffering It's time to go back to the club stop! With the addresses of the dancers in my possession i have enough to mount a vigilante bregade I asked my colleages to take a look at the houses of the girls on their trash round one garbage picked up one house monitored one girl protected Some dancers moved house and it becomes hard to find them but overall monitoring went well I never went back to my truck till i was sure the girl was safe at home c'mon baby, i'm going into orbit now! f**k the sh*t out of it! As if a killer knew about our surveilance he changed his target and killed a protitute the next day, her room is already emptied her stuff thrown out in the street ready to be picked up the girl prostituted herself to pay for college Common point with the dancers? They used their bodies to survive. The girl ahead of my truck is Gracie Adams I remember her prefectly She asked me what am i doing here she thinks i am the killer she drowns in a flood of questions well threatening me with her bat I told her i'm here to protect her like a bodyguard and i knew girls who were killed and i'm a regular at the club i managed to calm her down I tell her i formed a vigilante brigade but unfortunately, the killer seems to have changed his target She tells me that that prostitute was a former dancer She had enough money to leave the club and finish her studies she wanted to be a doctor shamed to know all these dancers their faces all their moves i appologized. She don't mind, she stopped dancing to become the club boss she liked to change her life and leave this one behind garbage is not only in the street you can meet it at the club too and among these bins my killer is probably somewhere Him? The only thing he'll ever kill is the luggage he carriers Him? a miserable thief who steals cars for him an uptight russian, but not a killer maybe that guy he saved two lives during an accident to take three lives one month after no... It could be that shit in the track suite but after a quick explanation no chance he is the killer The biker who went to pants himself just in front of the girl is as bad as suspect stop! Your observant eye will notice the guy's jacket Security Like the guy outside or behind me One shot and the sequence of events may kill a dancer you're lucky, bastard speak, motherf**ker! tell me what you know or i break your bones! After smashing him up for a few minutes he tells me what i wanna know an executive gave him a lot of money to have information about the dancers information that he can access with the security job The executive works at RON the largest oil company in the country he has a special interest in girls with problems addicts, poor girls who now are found bodies in the street i know this kind of guy a visionary, feels like he is on some deranged cleaning mission It's Nico. i need a favor, man. Could you go watch Cynthia's house this morning? i can't be there for another hour No problem, my friend. i'd be there in a few minute. This morning i have to monitor people who enter RON director, executive, secretary someone strong not too old I showed the pictures to Gracie but she's never seen anyone Hey grandpa, you're ok? answer me, please, man. Pick up the phone. Go! Get out, get out! call the cops get out of the way! move, move, move, move! get a hide! out of the way! Do out of the way! call the cops! come on, hide! Yesterday afternoon in New York a bloody chase caused several deaths before finishing in a subway A homeless man was killed in a subway having been run over by a train The police is looking for a man named Nico Bellic a garbage collector from Brooklyn. Did you have sweet dreams? Do you see the news?
