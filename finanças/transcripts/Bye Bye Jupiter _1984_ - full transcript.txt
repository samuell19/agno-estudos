Tell him l'm busy. You have an urgent visitor. Tell him to come later. You stink. You really smell bad. You still don't bathe regularly, eh? Pardon me. l'm Honda, Chief Investigator of the department. l'm Millicent Willem, inter-galactic linguist. Did you receive word from the Solar System Development department? No. l was out on assignment and just got back. Sounds like you know Japanese. Yes, a little. Kinn, maybe she can teach ya something. So what are you here for? Urgent business? Exactly. l'm here to tell you that your Jupiter Solar Project might be put on hold. The Solar Project... on hold? You see... when the polar ice caps on Mars were melted away, gigantic Nazca ca_ings in the ground were revealed. And apparently... those were drawn by aliens who visited the Solar System long ago. Nancy. Yes, Chief? When is the next department briefing? lt is scheduled at 9:30pm. Precisely 30 minutes from now. There you have it. l don't have much time to talk now, but... could you explain everything to me in detail in my o_ice? Yeah, l don't mind. Staying long? Then l guess we have time for a drink a_emards. Where are you going from here, Kinn? The comet's nest? But that's really far away. So what? 3 Giant Monsters: Earth's Greatest Battle The Space Arrow... What an amazing ship! lt was constructed to explore the comet's nest. For the record, you think for sure that aliens visited the Solar System long ago? l'm sure of it. The southern Nazca drawings... and the mysterious designs on the back side of the moon... And now this: the giant ca_ings found on Mars... One thing is clear: these are all messages le_ to us by them. So these aliens... when do you suppose they came to our Solar System? Their stay in Jupiter was 100,OOO years ago. And my guess is that their visit to Mars was 50,OOO years ago. So that all occurred before the human race evolved. So l guess the question is, does this alien visit to our Solar System 100,OOO years ago have anything to do with our current J.S. Project? N that we still cannot be sure... However, a_er decoding their messages, we discovered there is some sort of ''key'' in the red spot of Jupiter. On the red spot of Jupiter? Yes. And THAT'S why they want to put the J.S. Project on hold? They're not necessarily putting your project on hold. l just felt l should tell you about all of this since you are in charge of it. l knew l needed you to understand the gravity of the situation so you could help. Help? You want my help? Yes, l do. Because l think it's very likely we'll be traveling to the red spot on Jupiter. Chief Honda, Chief Honda, the meeting with the Earth Investigation Team will begin shortly. Please report to the Orientation Room immediately. Understood. lf you'll excuse me... When can we speak about this again? That depends on the results of this meeting. l'll contact you later. Esteemed colleagues, thank you for coming all this way to Mine_a Base. We would like to take you on a tour of this base and show you its inner operations... Oh, you mean this? lt's ''J.S. Project'', in other words, the Iogo for the Jupiter Solarization Project. The le_ side represents Jupiter and the right side represents the sun. lt also forms the year this Project was founded, 2100, and the year in which we hope to complete the project, 2140. Yes, speak. That's a good question, Mrs... Oh, pardon me. Miss Withers. That is a very relevant question. Let me explain to you all. As you're all aware, l'm sure, 500 million people already live in Solar Space outside of Earth. However, for those living in the outer planets, there are severe energy problems. That is because these planets are much farther away from the Sun than Earth and Venus are. The energy Jupiter gets from the sun is barely 1l27 of what Earth gets. They depend on nuclear fusion for much of their energy and this makes energy costs quite high. Yes. Since Jupiter is the largest planet in our System, we are considering changing it into a second sun. That is our idea. Colleagues, follow me. Allow me to introduce... Carlos Angeles. He is a vital member of our team; a man who worked on the reaction process itself. He is the leader of that sector. Don'tjump to conclusions. Solarizing Jupiter doesn't mean merely starting a chain reaction of nuclear fusion. Jupiter will not take kindly to this treatment, and if an error is made in calculations, Jupiter might explode. ln our J.S. Project, we intend to get nuclear fusion from the nucleus of Jupiter. We will use neutrino and anti-neutrino for this. Neutrino will be our main focus. Our Project will thus provide energy for the entire... l'm Inoue. Nice to meet you. Thank you. By the way, l heard that you have been outside Pluto's orbit many times, Captain Kinn. Jupiter Church? A church founded by a singer... Chief, the intruders are ready for interrogation. Does that hurt? Well, suck it up. The carbon chloride tank you ruined will be repaired. The demonstration you folks just gave was very powerFul and insigh_ul. But l don't wish to start a debate. You will all return to Earth on the next flight out. Unfortunately, we do not have the right to prosecute civilians from Earth. lt will be destroyed even without our inte_ention. The human race itself will not last another 100,OOO years. Unless we try to do something to change that before it's too late! Who's the ring leader? ls it you? Looks like she's the leader. l'll question her further. Get these boys cleaned up. About a trillion kilometers from the sun, there is a ring of dust and ice particles. This is the ''comet's nest''. Every year, three comets emerge from this circle and shoot towards the sun. But about 12-13 years ago, their numbers decreased. And now there are none. The first was four and a half years ago and the last was one year ago. Both suddenly stopped transmitting information. Millie, l just received your message. l would hate to lose Eiji for even an hour at this point, but l'll make a special exception for you. l just ordered him to move his investigation to the red spot on Jupiter. Thank you, Grandpa! Maria... lt's been three years! lt's a Japanese good luck charm. My mom insisted that l take it with me. Okay, good night. Why did you pull a stupid stunt like that? Don't tell me you joined those nuts to see me?? We were both born on Mars and grew up together... until our feelings blossomed into love. Just then, Maria's parenb were killed in a crash on their way to Earth. Torn bemeen her love for me and her hatred of outer space, Maria returned to Earth. Stop the room from revolving. Okay, a little. No, you're wrong, Maria. The Earth is too small for us. No, Maria. l can't do that. l've made a decision to join the people who venture into outer space. lt's the Space Arrow. My best friend is on it. Damn, l forgot to have a drink with Kinn. Chief Honda, Chief Honda. What's up? Chairman Webb has instructed that you investigate the red spot on Jupiter. Chairman Webb? And also, the next ship for Earth will leave in an hour. We need to prepare the members of the Jupiter Church for departure. Understood. l can't do that now, Maria. Thank you, Grandpa. ''Thank you, Grandpa''?? Is that all? Everyone else is annoyed that the J.S. Project is slowing down. Scientists think they're sooooo special. Mr. Chairman. ls the Jupiter Project really this important? ls it absolutely necessary to solarize Jupiter? Please consider that the public opinion regarding additional costs for space development are very critical of the project. The Earth has become too small for us. The Earth is stifling the vitality of its inhabitanb. That is why we need the J.S. Project. We will let the old-Earth have the old-Sun. For those of us... who have begun to live on other planets... we need a new sun. And it will be Jupiter. A new symbol for mankind. The ship we board sails to the east. Chasing a_er the endless sunrise and sunset The color of the clouds covering the moon. And the splash ofthe waves. Show an eternal kaleidoscope that will never look the same again. The starwe stand on glitters coldly. Guiding Jupiter and Venus. As eveyone around me travels through the same time, For some reason, fond memories return. l am glad you are with me. l want to live without fear. l want to burn out like a comet. Understood. This is our target spot. The giant red spot is covered in storms. Would you like the screen on slow motion? How much lower can we go? 1,200 meters from the clouds. There's just a tiny spot we can go to. Roger. Shut up! lt's really shaking... Not as bad as out there. tMnna hear the outside noise? Will it ALWAYS be like this?? A_er we get a bit lower it'll calm down. The atmosphere is always like this. Hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon react... then that causes things to heat up quite a bit. ls it exploding?? Jupiter is layered with hot air. We're now 1000 km from the clouds. We're very close to the red spot. This is about as far as we can go. Honda! What's this activity showing up on the sensors? Whatever it is, it's moving fast... Couldn't itjust be a hydrogen cloud? But it has a very clear outline. l wonder if it's the ship the aliens wrote about in their messages?! But it's gotta be 100 km long. That's really big... lt's the Jupiter Ghost! ''Jupiter Ghost''? Yes. This large, lifeless form that was discovered here earlier. We don't know what it is, so we named it ''Jupiter Ghost''. Where is it? 4:30. lt's just 1000 km away from us. Can we get in closer? ... l'll try. We'd better climb out... Not yet! There's something coming from it that looks like a transmission beam... Can't you get closer? No, l can't. lf we don't get out now, we're REALLY screwed. There it is again! The Jupiter Ghost... lt's moving around the red spot. lt's huge. 100... no... 120 km long. Chief, what will you do? Easy, Carlos. How much longer are you going to keep it up? If you don't stop, there will be an accident! Yes, but l'm on direct orders from Chairman Webb of the SSD. You shouldn't accept such a crazy order! Anyway, we can't help you with your search anymore. Chief, why don't you try asking the Chairman to change the schedule a little? l'm going on record, Chief, we can't delay the J.S. Project any longer. Going somewhere? Yes. To the Moon. Thanks to you we were able to discover the alien's spaceship in Jupiter's atmosphere. The only remaining mystery is that transmission it tried to send us. l'll pour into deciphering it as much l can while on the Moon's computer center. l also plan to continue investigating the Jupiter Ghost. l also want to meet with Mr. Webb to discuss the J.S. Project and the schedule for this mission. Thanks. You sure are a busy man. Chief Honda, please check your message card. Don't push yourself too hard, okay? tMit... pause it. You know Dr. Inoue? Long ago... l loved him. l'm trying... but they're both frozen... What in the world happened? Looks like you can't keep your promise, Kinn... . But don't worry. l'll drink for you. Chief Honda, Chief Honda, the ship is leaving for the Moon. Please hurry. What is there to drink to anyways? Mr. President? What do you wish to do? l want the class-A press on this. l will depart for SSDO HQ on the moon at once. As you wish, Mr. President. Mr. President, thank you for coming so quickly. lsn't this double the principal orbit of Pluto? Yes, but in mo years, the Solar System will move 15 billion kilometers closer to the black hole. And then what? Will it smash into the sun? Somewhere on Earth, it is spring, or perhaps summer. Somewhere on Earth, it is autumn, or perhaps winter. The sun and the sky watch over the earth The clouds and the wind watch over the sea Embracing them gently and singing a song of the seasons. When we answer their song, we praise this planet. You failed again at the computer center on the moon. We can't go at this half-hearted. No way! It's impossible to evacuate that many people in 2 years! Do you suppose we could build evacuation ships in mo years for everyone? lf it's 10,OOO-passenger ships... we can make 10,OOO at most. So only 100 million, eh... And the current population of Earth is 18 billion. And which planet can we evacuate 100 million people to? Jupiter? And abandon the rest? Sacrifice the lives of 18 billion individuals! And all the civilization which we have created on land and in space! ls this really the only option? Isn't there a better answer? There's one. He is Eiji Honda from Mine_a. Speak to us, Honda. When the black hole closes in... destroy Jupiter. Jupiter? How will we blow this planet up? We can do it. All it takes is a little change in the J.S. Project... Are you serious?! Destroy Jupiter?! Destroy the J.S. Project that we have worked so hard on?? ...Oh, very well. Let's hear your plan. lt is believed that the black hole spins at super speeds. Jupiter is only 1l50th the size of the black hole, but presently with the J.S. Project, we're conducting experiments to produce a slow reaction nuclear fusion. lf we change it to a rapid reaction, Jupiter will explode. lf we control the rate and size of this explosion well, we can guide Jupiter to hit the black hole at the center of its spinning. lf this happens, we can at least slightly alter the course of the black hole. l think we can prevent it from colliding with the sun. What is the chance of success? Presently, 20-30^/o. 20^/o is not O^/o. Even if the chances were 5^/o, it would be better to try this plan than to do nothing at all. Yes, but it is very dangerous. N course, we will continue with the evacuation plan as well. N course, we still have our evacuation plan. We will put forth every e_ort to carry it out. However, even saving O.5^/o of the Earth's population this way will be di_icult. Thanks. What? A black hole? What's up with that? They want to make Jupiter explode? Who the hell ARE you? Are things going well? Any progress? What a crazy schedule! They expect us to make a device like that in just mo years?? It's impossible even for us! lf we keep at this rate, there's no telling how many hundreds of people will die. Yes, but if we're successful, we can at least save 18 billion lives. How much longer is the Chief gonna be at the moon?? Get him back NOW. Take it easy, Carlos... 'sir! These are members of our worker-force from Earth. They were acting strangely, so we thought we'd take precautions... Booker What's wrong with him? He's dead. The ship he was on exploded. lt's probably the doings of the Jupiter Church. l'm sick of this! l'm going to Earth at once. l'll meet with that ''Peter'' leader of theirs. Eiji... l've got more bad news for you. Carlos was also in an accident. l hear it's serious. lt's drive! All we need to accomplish our goals is drive! And we have a strong organization to back us up! N course we have. But it's not enough. We have these pills for when the time comes. lt gives you courage without side e_ecb. Not now. Only when the time comes. l'm going to go have a talk with Peter now. Actually, l think we should test these out first... Do you know where Maria is? Then where's your leader, Peter? Are you Peter? Yes, l am. And you? Honda Eiji, Chief of J.S. Project investigations. Ohhh, so you're Maria's lover. l came here to tell you to stop the destruction. But l have never told any of my followers to destroy. Ours is a Church that encourages prese_ation of nature's beauty and joy in life. Your people set explosives on one of our messenger vessels. A good friend who l worked six years with died! Are you sure members of my Church did that? How are you feeling, Maria? Since you're the leader... tell your people to stop destroying our plans. Let me tell you, l am NOT their leader. l've never preached at a pulpit. l just feel emotions, turn them to song, and sing them. The sea, the sun, and the wind... the birds and the animals... the fish and the flowers... l simply create harmony bemeen all living things. Have you ever been in space? No. Rather than exploring the universe, l find it is much more enjoyable to admire it from Earth. l wish you had visited outer space just once. lf you had, your songs would have been a little di_erent. The black hole is very near now, isn't it. lt will be on us soon. You're trying to alter the black hole's course to destroy Jupiter, l hear. Who told you that?! All living beings live rich lives... however, they all die. You think it's important to fight in order to postpone your demise. But l wish to stay here with all the other doomed inhabitanb of Earth, upli_ing them and singing to them until we all die. What's wrong with Jupiter? ls he okay? Get Jupiter! Jupiter! Jupiter, don't die! Someone! Is there a vet around? No Jupiter! Don't die! Hey, Jupiter! Did you unlock the shark fence? Then put it back at once! Outside your little paradise, there are killers. Bye-bye, Jupiter. Good bye. Good bye... You were vey big And amays, amays sparkled. You were vey gentle And amays, amays smiled. But that sparkle and that smile Will vanish into the night. Farewell, my big friend farmell, our brother. Carlos... Carlos! Chief Heard you were hurt bad... The planet Jupiter has been my friend since l was a child. l have to take care of it, so l can't die. Can you work in your condition? l'm fine now. l thought of a great idea while in the hospital bed. Look at this. The code name is Mahayana 60. ln order to obse_e movement in the system, we create a room here. That way we can control all the switches of the system. How many evacuation vessels are complete? Chief. Red Group, listen up. We're ten hours behind schedule. We need to do something to make up this delay if we want to finish on time. Very well, we only have ten hours le_. God help us. And do you, Mr. President need God's help? l prefer to pray to man's wisdom and technology. That sounds like a wish to me, not a prayer. No... l still want to pray. Here it comes... lt's coming from deep within the Solar System. Only 75 hours until B time. Red Group, the last unit to evacuate, has 15 hours. Did you volunteer to work this post? Thanks... A man l once loved was on the Space Arrow when it was sucked into the black hole. And now, those people who work at this station, attempting to alter the course of that black hole... are the most in danger. l want to see to it that they all su_ive. l understand. To me, Jupiter was a symbol of our last hope. l wanted to make it the new center of our Solar System. And now, ironically, l have to destroy that hope with my own hands. The message le_ to us by those aliens from long ago... was warning us about the black hole. Are you sure? What were they trying to tell us? l think the key to the mystery is in that Jupiter Ghost. lf l just had more time, l could have solved it... what a pity. The remains of the first contact bemeen aliens and the human race is going to be destroyed with Jupiter. Maria has the plan. Five hours to go. Get into the final checkup stage. Company, keep cool. All systems normal. ls there a leak?! There's too strong an equatorial current! Jupiter might get squeezed in. Keep the current at 10! Friends, let's take the final pills now. Then we won't be scared of anything. Maria, explain it to them again. l did some snooping around and found there there's a ship by the regulator room. A_er we're done, we can escape to Mars. LISTEN to me, Chief. We now have more accurate data on the black hole. We can and must use it to make our explosion 100^/o perFect. Please let me do some more calculations! l understand how you feel, Carlos. But we have no time le_. But we DO have enough time! What? What is it? l want to give Jupiter a perFect death. My beloved Jupiter... How long will this take? 40 minutes. This is Flash Bird. Can you hear me? l'm headed to the regulator room for a final checkup. Richard, Tanaka... Yes? Come with me. Four men are going to the regulator room. We should finish barely on schedule. lt's time. There's no turning back now. Let's go. Hurry! Come on, let's go. They'll be here any minute. Okay, we're starting! Chief, check the time. We're over our limit. Flash Bird, do you read me? Answer! Roger. Hey, can someone go to the circuit room and turn o_ circuits 226 and 8? Follow my signal. Chief, put Program K6273 and 4730 on standby. And also, connect the cable from Computer A4 to G6. Let's wait a bit longer. We can't give up now. We must make sure to destroy the core of this device. l understand. We'll wait ten minutes tops. A_er ten minutes is up, we'll attack the regulator room. Chief, check Program W2366 at speed-4. And Tanaka! Put Memory 239 on standby. Memory 239... Okay, here we go! Okay, we're done! We did it! Turn on all circuits. Tanaka! Return the computer to A and lock it up. Flashbird 7, we're finished here. Prepare for entry. Circuit Room, go to the dispatch deck and stand by. We'll join you a_er our final check. Very soon now... lntruders? l'm not done with the final check! Carlos! Carlos, take cover! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos, are you okay? The controls... the controls... Shit. This small gun is no good. Come closer to me... Closer. Come closer. Who the hell ARE you? Hey, anyone else here? Anyone else?! Peter... good bye, Peter... Carlos! tMit here. Carlos, are you okay? l'm going back. This ship will automatically navigate. You'll be picked up. There are still some intruders le_. Understand? Guess this is good bye, Carlos. Take care. l promise... l promise l'll blast Jupiter for you. Good bye, Carlos. Go on see through. Show the real image. Predict where the intruder will go. Drop your weapon. Drop it! My gun is aimed at your head. Where did you put the explosives? Hey! Maria... Eiji... lt's you... The system on Jupiter should have started thirty minutes ago. tMves from the telemator should get here shortly. Looks like the last victims of this project have emerged. How many? Four. And one of them is still in the control room. lt's impossible for him to escape. Who is he? Eiji Honda. Honda... Explosives... sabotage agents... Iooks like we avoided a catastrophe. ''l have removed all the explosives. This is my last transmission to you. Good bye, my friends.'' ls that all of them? l can't undo the lock on the timer. When? Then there's only one way le_. Are you in pain, Maria? Just a little. l'm sorry. There's only a first-aid kit here. Sit tight. l'll be back right away. Maria... Look at this, Maria. The background of the panel... it's turned red. What a relief. lt's entered phase 3. The device has finished its job. Jupiter is shrinking. And this base will also fall apart. Yes. Much before the explosion. Maria... l want to hear my friend's voice. Press the red button. lt's stopped spinning. Jupiter is shrinking... and we are, too... What's that voice? lt's from Jupiter. lt's a transmission from Jupiter. Jupiter is saying something! Just listen to it! From Jupiter? lmpossible! Jupiter is... giving us... a farewell message. l will... protect the Solar System. l'll turn to gas to make that happen. l'm fine with that. The su_ivors... will cross the Solar System... and... Jupiter... lt's saying good bye... Good bye, Jupiter. Attention, inhabitanb of Earth. Attention, inhabitanb all over the universe. Our Solar System has just met with an unimaginable crisis. But thanks to many brave and wise people who sacrificed their lives, we are saved. l would like to commend them all. Eiji, you died before me. To think that a young man like you had to die... so that an old man like me could live without hope. l am too old. Now that Jupiter is gone, this asteroid's path will likely be changed. l'm not sure if l'll ever be able to visit your grave again... Chairman Webb, Dr. Willem, Dr. Angeles. It's time to leave. Please return to the ship. Millie, l have a favor to ask. What is it, Carlos? When l die, can you dig me a grave next to Eiji? No! l'm tired of building nothing but graves for those l love! l don't want to do it again! A soldier can abandon even a hurt friend. l want you to transfer all your pain to me. You poor, lonely soul who forgot to live for your own happiness. l met you l loved you And l want to be proud of that until l die. A voyager disappears into the blue sky, into a cold dream. Mankind never notices the things that change mankind. How far is your destination? Will you ever return? l met you l loved you And l want to be proud of that until l die.
