Can I see the one with the shell on it? - Yeah. [CAR ENGINE] - It's beautiful. [ENGINE ROARING] It's hard to decide because they're all so pretty. - Yeah, they are. [BEADS CLICKING] [BIRDS SINGING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - What the fuck? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HORN BEEPING] Fucking asshole. [VEHICLE CRASHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hey, don't worry about it. I'm calling 911 right now. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] CLARK: On an isolated highway, fear dominated the thoughts of its travelers for nearly a decade. That is, until an anonymous tip helped the FBI capture one of the most notorious serial murderers in recent history. Today, I'll talk to a group of young crusaders determined to set the innocent free You all firmly believe that John Michael Warbach is not the Highway Killer. - We wouldn't be here right thought if we thought that he had anything to do with the murders. - Even though he not only confessed but his DNA was recovered from one of the victims? - We highly question the confession - We've seen this same type of scenario happen dozens of times, where someone is sequestered in a room for 12 hours. They don't have an attorney. They're threatened. Maybe they have a low IQ, or they're just afraid. But innocent people confess a lot more often than people think - Is there any new evidence supporting your claims? - Well, it's not just the new evidence but yeah, there's plenty of evidence Any good court would exonerate him today - There isn't any evidence proving his guilt. Yes, he admitted to having sex with one of the victims, but she was a prostitute working at a truck stop that he frequented - And that is the only crime scene where his DNA was found. Wasn't at any other crime scene. No fingerprints, no fiber transfers It's questionable he was even an near the other crime scenes. - We've got affidavits from witnesses who say he was in a confrontation with a state trooper about two miles from where Jane Doe victim was last located. - Do you think the police set him up - We don't think they set him up We think that they just rushed their investigation. - So he's a truck driver, which you know that, right? He travels that highway every month as do hundreds of other truckers Just because he's in the area, I mean, other than that what is the overwhelming evidence pointing at Mr. Warbach - There isn't any. He got into an argument with the state trooper about his log book hours. He started rattling off about his constitutional rights, so then they brought him in and then they interrogated him for 12 hours. They were able to tag him with one murder. One murder led to two. They were able to press him to confess, and that was it. - Case closed. - Case closed. - They got their man. - They got their man, not the right man. - If what you say is true, there is still a killer out there - Yes, an innocent man is on death row and there is still a serial killer that can take more lives. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [COUPLE MOANING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [PHONE BUZZING] [PHONE PINGING] [PHONE PINGING] - Can't sleep? - No, I have to work. - Huh? - You should go home. - Wait. Hey, are you serious? - Yeah. [LOVER SIGHING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] LOVER: I'm out. Text me. DONATELLA: Fine, I'll just move out. MONSTER: Good! Get the fuck out and take your shit! [SHOWER RUNNING] MOM: Baby, baby baby, just go back upstairs, okay? MONSTER: And you better get it out before today! You better get it out or I will fucking burn it! [HIGH PITCHED RINGING] DONATELLA: I'm just gonna call the sheriff. That's it. And I'm just gonna [STUTTERS]. I'm gonna tell him all about you MONSTER: [LAUGHS] You're gonna call the sheriff DONATELLA: Yes. MONSTER: You're a crack whore! You gonna tell him about all the that you snort up in that fucking nose of yours? DONATELLA: I will fucking kill you! - Yeah, then kill me [ECHOES]. MONSTER: Do it bitch. Kill me. - What did you say? TRAVIS: I asked if you're going out tonight. - No, I'm gonna keep going over the psychological profile. - You know it's the weekend? You can take a break every once in a while. ANA: Could you pick up the van? - I will get Danny to do it. He's into the mechanical nature of this gig. ANA: He most likely was familiar with the area before the murders took place. - Danny? - The killer. - How the fuck do you know that? - The killer would have been covered with blood head to toe. If he knew her, gained her trust then he could have taken her that way but if he didn't know her, he took her by force. There's trace evidence going back and forth, but either way, he'd had to have known the area. He had to have known that he had privacy and a safe point of egress. TRAVIS: Egress. You sound like the FBI. - Is that a good thing? - I guess so. Is all this in the report? - Yeah. TRAVIS: Does it say who the killer is? Make this a hell of a lot easier Then you wouldn't have to go on the serial killer tour. ANA: Whether he knew her or not, he knew the location. It was, it was special to him. It was sacred, maybe. [TRAVIS COUGHING] - Did you watch the show last night? - What? TRAVIS: The show. - No. TRAVIS: Well, I recorded it. Kinda made it look like you were the team leader or something. - Can you send the email to make sure that everyone's going to be there tomorrow? - I guess if I had nicer tits, they would've given me more screen time. - Travis. - Yeah, I got it. I'll send the email. I know, I'm a dick. [TRAVIS SIGHING] But I am talented. - Are you trying to be famous, or are you trying to save a life? - I'm trying to save a life, of course. I have to kill somebody if I wanna be famous. [TRAFFIC PASSING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] - You trying to get me demoted, or just fired? Maybe arrested? ANA: None of the above. I just need to know what you know about the latest Highway murder. [SIGHS] Highway murder case is closed. You must be speaking of a local homicide. outside of FBI jurisdiction. - My source says that this case is identical to the others. - Similar, not identical. What are you doing with a source I thought I was your source. ANA: Why don't you just reopen your case and save me the trouble of having to go above your head? - You ever heard of finality of judgement? - Have you ever heard of fully exonerated? - What do you want from me? ANA: I already told you. I just need to know what you know. - No, nothing has come to the attention of the FBI that would lead us to believe we to reopen our previous investigation Is that official enough for you and the Innocent Initiative? Or are you guys gonna shit talk the Bureau to the press again? - Why are you so sure that he's guilty? - This may come as a shock to you but sometimes you don't know every damn thing. - And that's why I ask questions - You ever stop to think there might be more to the story? - What is that supposed to mean? - I'm just saying he's there for a reason. ANA: So because we're all guilty of something, that means we all get what we deserve, right? - You don't know what you're looking for. I think you should consider another hobby. Now that's all you need? I've gotta go catch some terrorists. Ana? Ana? [ENGINE REVVING] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] ANA: If he annoys you or gives you any shit, just ignore him. Talk to me if it gets to be a problem. Like he's, he means well. - Apologies. - I know, I know. ANA: It's just his way. DIERDRE: Okay, okay. TRAVIS: Hello, everyone. ANA: You're buying lunch today. - I'm buying lunch today, I know. I'll pay my penance. You can flog me as punishment, if you're into that kinda thing. - No thank you. - My loss. DIERDRE: Hey, you wanna put your bag in the back? TRAVIS: No, I'll keep it with me DANY: Ana? - Yeah. - It's supposed to rain today in the high country. Do you think we should consider- TRAVIS: No [LAUGHS]. No, we're not calling this off. - I'm not talking to you. - I made plans. It's the only weekend I have available to do this. We're gonna have to proceed as fucking planned. DIERDRE: Come on, everyone, please. Just load up. Get in the car. Let's go. Come on, please. I don't have all day. - I'm in the car. Yell at Suzie Seoul back there. She got the OCD hitting on all cylinders. Everything packed yet? - Hey, you know, you're an asshole, and I don't have OCD. - And I don't think you know what OCD is. - Take it easy. [HATCH SLAMMING] - That's right. You two are having a thing. My bad. Serious question, for real. - Uh-huh. - Is it Deedra or Deardra? Because I'm never sure if I'm pronouncing your name right. - It's, it's Dierdre. - Dear, Deedra? - Dierdre, yes. - Got it. I'm not buying lunch, by the way - We're just one big happy family, aren't we? - You know we are. [UPBEAT MUSIC] AARON (VO): I gave you some leeway on the Wahrbach case. I wanna close this case and move on But you're on television, you're on college campuses, you're requisitioning vehicles. ANA (VO): So you're saying I can't use the van? AARON (VO): I don't care about the van. I care about you continuing a case. I specifically told you was dead in the water. ANA (VO): I don't think that the case is dead in the water. I can trace everything back to victim number three, and it will either reaffirm his guilt or it will prove that he's innocent And either way we still look good. AARON (VO): Great, you have until the next board meeting to get it all settled, and then I'm moving you to something more urgent. [ENGINE IDLING] - This looks bleak. [CAR DINGING] ANA: Travis, can you get video? - This is not a toy in my hand. I am getting video. - Thank you. - Gonna look amazing, too. ANA: It better. TRAVIS: Hey, fearless leader. - Hm. - I'm gonna document the area, you know, professionally. - Please do. And I'm nobody's leader, I'm just punctual. TRAVIS: Never gonna live that down. ANA: All right, so ... - We can use that later. ANA: There's gonna be two maps. This one's of the general area. ANA: This one, though ... DANNY: Hey, we're gonna check some cabins over here. ANA: Okay, Umm, when you're over there, can you listen? - Listen for what? - Anything that we can use. - Right. - Guys, don't just go back there to fuck. - No, y'all's dirty, perverted souls reflect more on you guys than it does on us. - There's bugs and shit. Just be careful. ANA: They're gonna fuck. DIERDRE: They're totally fucking [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [BAG UNZIPPING] - Don't fall. How long do you think we have? ANA: He must have camped here when he was a kid. DIERDRE: Well there was probably thousands of kids that came through this camp during this timeline. I don't even know if we can find any records from that time. ANA: If they do exist, maybe we can get them. - All right. You cold? - Yes. - Got my jacket. [BAG UNZIPPING] ANA: We need to get around that red tape. DIERDRE: I know, but that's a lot easier said than done. ANA: How would we get it done though? [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CAMERA CLICKING] [BAG ZIPPING] [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - I would die if I had to be out here all by myself. I mean, you can't hear anything man made. When was the last time you haven't heard something man-made - Shoot, my mother's womb, probably - I'm being serious. I mean, it's scary to think that if you're screaming for help no one on Earth can hear you. That's pretty fricking creepy. DIERDRE: I mean this is a fucking summer camp, not a federal office. I don't know. ANA: You know, we could get creative. [DOOR CREAKING] - So you wanna move on? - Yeah, let's move on. [DOOR CREAKING] - I think the body was placed there later. Because we've got two victims near Harkinsville, one near Vegas, one near Wickenburg And Victim Three was over here. [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - You're okay, right? - Yeah. - You think he killed them and then dumped the bodies in different spots? - I do. - No. No, I think that's, that's too far of a stretch. - Yeah, that's why I haven't said it out loud.

Some folks wanna move to the city Not me! No way. I like the big trees, changing seasons, wide-open spaces. This is really living, you know? My mother used to say I talk too much. Sorry about that. - No, it's not you. I'm just worried about my friends. - I'm sure everything's gonna be okay when we get back to the garage. Sheriff is really sharp. EARL: She'll help you figure everything out ANA: Can you drop me off at the police station instead? EARL: No, there's nobody there. I already told you. This is a one-horse town. Sheriff's office closes at sundown. Doesn't open again until break of dawn. I'll do whatever you want. It's just well ... It's just I feel bad about leaving you out there alone at night. ANA: I'm armed. EARL: Empty. But armed. How about this? Let's get you bandaged up, maybe put some food in your belly While we wait for the sheriff. I was deputized. When that Indian boy went missing a couple years ago. You remember that? - No, I never heard about that. - No? Shame. It made the news.

He's been chasing me through the woods. He has one of my friends stuffed in a barrel. HOLCOMB: You know what that sounds like, right? - I know it sounds crazy, but he's also gonna tell you a crazy story, and you're gonna have to decide which one of us to believe, and I'm at a disadvantage because you don't know me. - Not too much of a disadvantage I know him, but I don't like him ANA: Her name is Suzanne Kim. She's stuffed in a barrel. She is probably 19. I don't know what he's done with the rest of them. But her body is in there disintegrating. HOLCOMB: Watch your head. ANA: Whatever you do, whatever he says, just look in that barrel, look through his place. Please be careful, though, when you do it. [DOOR SLAMMING] [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [DOOR SLAMMING] [ENGINE IDDLING] [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [ANA SNIFFING] [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - All right, I asked him if could give his place a once-over, and he said okay, so A few minutes, one way or another you're gonna be outta here.

I know I joke around a little bit but um, Like seriously, what the fuck? You guys left? Still trying to find everybody. And, just wanna say ahead of time, when I do find you, that you may all come together as a group and blow me. Here I am pissing in the woods, taking a small break from driving around in the middle of fucking nowhere looking for Ana. When I'm done with this, I'll go back to that, and, I don't know, I guess I'm going to stay here till I find her, because I can't leave. We're here, so ... Great, awesome trip so far. Really having a blast. Success, thanks.
