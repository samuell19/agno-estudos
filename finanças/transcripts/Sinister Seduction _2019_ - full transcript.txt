[instrumental music] [panting] [gasps] You scared me! Who the hell are you? [intense music] Oh! [groaning] - [birds chirping] - [reel whirring] [instrumental music] Anthony? Honey. It's time to get up. Are you feeling okay? [groans] I don't have a fever. I don't feel sick. I just, I need a mental health day. Is Brent Kilby bothering you again? What? No, mom. God! - Okay. I'll call Katie. - No. Don't call Katie. It's your first day back. I don't mind, Anthony. I don't like leaving you alone on days like this. Fine. I'll go to school. Uh, okay. Uh, can I drop you off? I'll take the bus. Oh. [Sharon] I thought old-fashioned days were supposed to be dead-end days. [laughs] Perhaps our donut system is a bit too binary for the vagaries of police work. So is this about Jared Fields? Do you remember Terry Mills? Class clown, always referred to himself in the third person? He invited you to homecoming, sophomore year. That would be a yes. If you would've just said yes, you probably would've ended up Mrs. Sharon Mills, and I could be investigating the murder of strangers, instead of trying to figure out which one of our high-school buddies killed the other one over a protein-shake business. It's a lifestyle company, Teddy. So are you gonna tell me or what? The results of Jared's voluntary forensic audit came back. There's a cash withdrawal that he can't account for. How long prior to Mark's death? A month. What's the rule? Nobody at the precinct finds out you're feeding me information. I also feel compelled to remind you that Jared Fields has a great alibi and there's no concrete evidence that links him to this case. Except for the death threats he left in our door made from his email. Which is purely circumstantial. Any punk with fifteen bucks and Google can hack into any email. How's he doing? [sighs] I think he has a bully. [Teddy] Really? [indistinct chatter] You like 'em? I'm taking Digital Photography Two this year. Thought I'd brush up on my editing skills. Yeah, Brent, my mom in her underwear. Are you trying to be an embarrassing caricature of 1980 masculinity or is it just natural to you? [grunts] Yeah, slam a kid against the locker, Brent. - It's real mature. - I said shut up! Gentlemen. Is everything okay here? We're fine, right? - Who the hell are you? - How about you, man? You as fine as that other guy? - Yeah. I'm-I'm doing great. - Yeah. He's doin' great! Mind your own business. Not very polite now, are ya? Whatever, man. [instrumental music] - [intense music] - [laptop keys clacking] [knocking on door] Hey, Katie. - As you requested. - Thank you. Have there been any new queries? Uh, only non-stop since we posted about your return on social. [Sharon] Any for this one in particular? Well, no, I, I didn't list it. Um, I just, I just wanted to make sure you were ready. I'm ready. Hey, man. - Hey, Anthony, you know Megan? - Hey. - Anthony, Megan. Megan, Anthony. - Hi. Megan's mom works at the front office. Perfect for making sure that transfers and freshmen don't make fools of themselves. [Dylan] It's Anthony's first year, too. Oh, cool. Uh, how are you liking it so far? - So far so good. - Great. Um, well, I got Biology, so... All right, I'll see you later, man! - Uh, what? - At the field, remember? [Dylan] Tryouts? [Megan] Oh, uh... You're trying out for football? Yeah. - [whistle blows] - [indistinct yelling] What the hell am I doing here? - Let me see that. - Look at that. Oh, my God! Anthony Elliot, you do know you have to hit people in this sport, right? Yeah, I, I got that, Kilby. Thanks. This guy. [grunts] Yo, coach, who's this kid? Name's Dylan Warren. Told me he wants to try for QB, so I asked him to throw a couple of passes. Says he's never played before. I call BS. - [man] Touchdown! - All right! [whistle blows] Bring it in! [coach] Bring it in, guys. All right, this is hell week. This is tryouts. Not everybody's gonna make it, but you need to do your best. Hut! Hut! Hut! Go, Ted, come on, we gotta get ready! There you go! - [grunting] - Come on, Elliot! [coach] Show me football! Touchdown! Good job! Good job! [grunting] Remember, wrap up only. Squat position. Chest up. Wrap and release. Set! - [whistle blows] - [both grunting] Good. Next. [intense music] [coach] Ready? [chuckles] Take position, three-point stance. Ready? Set! [Kilby grunts] - [coach] Damn it, Kilby! - [whistle blows] - What did I just say? - Come on, coach... That's three eight-hundreds! And they better be sprints. Now, Kilby, or you're off the team! [Anthony sighs] You all right, kid? - Come on. - [grunts] [Sharon] Wow. That went well. Any bets on how quickly you think he'll make an offer? Uh, you know, remember about chickens and hatching. Have you been eyeing a date for the open house yet? Third Saturday of next month. Can we bump that up? We can do whatever we want, boss. Good, 'cause I wanna light a fire under the Hendersons. [Katie chuckles] [groans] Hey, man. I just wanted to say good job out there today. Good job getting my ass kicked? [chuckles] Yeah, that and getting back up. Now I understand my dad's manic desire for a pool. - Pool? - Yeah, he, uh... He had one installed before he... Before he got killed. You know about that, too. It seems like you know everything about me. I don't know anything about you other than your name's Dylan. And I only know that 'cause the coach was raving about your arm. [chuckles] How did you learn how to throw like that? Good genes, I guess. Why? Well, what's wrong? First you help me with Brent... and then tryouts and now Megan. We just met, Dylan. Why are you being so nice to me? [exhales sharply] I guess I kind of see us as kindred spirits after I learned about your dad. Why's that? Because my dad died, too. Suicide. About two years ago. But, hey, at least your dad wanted to live. My dad found life so unbearable with me and my mom, he... cut his wrists in the bathroom. So when I heard some kids talking about your story, I figured you might need a friend. No one should ever go through what you're going through alone like I did. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, I just... What's Megan's number? [both chuckling] That's what I'm talking about. [intense music] [door creaking] Anthony? Anthony? Anthony? Anthony? [intense music] [knocking on door] Anthony? - [engine revving] - [tires screeching] [Anthony] Yes, just right here is good. Yeah. Anthony! I was expecting you to come home right after school. Hey, sorry, I was at football tryouts. Try-tryouts? Uh, yeah, football. Uh... Um, uh, mom, this is Dylan. Uh, he plays quarterback. I was wondering if we could, maybe, have some people over tonight for swimming or... - Tonight? - Yeah. Of course, yes. That would be great. Um, just help me tidy up the place a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'll see you tonight. - What's with the trash bag? - Uh, don't. It's a long story. Oh, I'm sorry. Come on in. [mellow music] [pop music on stereo] ♪ I hope that I could be that someone you could talk to ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've seen enough this time ♪ ♪ And I need to make you mine ♪ ♪ I've seen enough this time there's no one like you ♪ ♪ I've seen enough this time and I need to make you mine ♪ ♪ I've seen enough this time ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ah ♪ ♪ I can't... ♪♪ - [girl] Yay! - Oh, my God, this is so cool. Thought you guys might need some snacks! - Thank you! - Here, come on. Hey. Where's your bathroom? Uh, oh, it's right there to the right. Cool. [indistinct chatter] All right, mom, I'd like you to meet Megan. [intense music] [music continues] Dylan? Sorry, I-I-I didn't mean to snoop. I was just looking for the bathroom and I-I-I... There is a bathroom right back there. Right. Got it. You know, you don't always feel the way you're supposed to. When someone dies. Nobody told me that. Oh, um... Who? My dad. Just like Anthony. I'm so sorry. Anger, that's, uh, that's the first thing I felt. Then guilt, and then anger for the guilt. [inhales sharply] And, um... took me a little time before I could just... be sad. Well... That feels really good to say out loud. Sorry. Also, um... thanks for lettin' all of us come over tonight. Great to just feel so... So, so what? Normal. [sighs] I don't suppose you wanna tell me why your backpack is in my washing machine? Got it. Um... - Well, Dylan seems neat. - Yeah. And a little old. You mean, why is he hanging out with me? No, I don't. His dad died, too. I know, I know, he told me. He tell you it was suicide? No. Not everyone's out to get something from you, mom. Just like... not everyone cares that dad's dead. How are you feeling about dad? However you're feeling, Anthony, it's okay. You can tell me. [sighs] [clears throat] How do you feel? Sad, Anthony. I feel sad. [indistinct chatter] [Dylan] Yeah. Looks-looks good. Good. One more time at half speed. Ready? Set! Hut! - [Dylan chuckles] - Whoo! Yes, that's it. It's simple. How do you know so much about football? Coach said you never played before. Uh, well, I wasn't really telling the whole truth on that one. Why not? I don't want him talking to my old coach at my school. What happened? When my dad died, I was angry. Mouthed off a lot. Coach got tired of it and kicked me off the team. Well, you don't think the new coach would understand something like that? Not as much as you do, Anthony. You gotta remember, people who haven't gone through what we've gone through don't understand that. I mean, even your mom, I'm sure she's sad and all, but losing a husband is not the same as losing a father. - It just isn't. - [school bell ringing] Better move it, froshy. You're gonna be late. - You're not coming? - Study period. Besides, I got an errand to run. [instrumental music] [Dylan] Hey, Sharon, it's great to see you again. Dylan, hey, I was so surprised when Katie said you called. Katie? Yeah, it's nice to meet you in person. - Hi, Dylan. Same. - [cell phone rings] Oh, this is the Hendersons. Dylan, if your uncle wants this place, he better move fast. - Noted. - Hi, Jack. How are you? - This is for you. - Thank you. - Uh, so your uncle... - Uh, Nate Warren. - You know him? - I don't think so. He's my legal guardian since my dad passed away. He works over at Grand Vista. Oh, uh, so he's, um, he's a psy... Psychiatrist, yeah. We're over in Carmichael Heights right now, but I guess he's looking for a change, so... Well, that's a nice neighborhood. I guess so. Yeah, it's closer to the hospital. Why would he want to move here? There's a lot that my uncle does that does not make much sense to me. A-Anthony told me about your dad, um... Does this mean that your mom is also... Do you always ask potential buyers this many personal questions? I'm sorry. No, you're right. It's just that you and Anthony, you seem so close, and you clearly know so much about me, so I just, I feel a little behind. My mom's at Grand Vista, too. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's the best place for her. So you're gonna give me the grand tour or what? I will. Let's start upstairs. And, and we'll work our way down. That is the master bathroom. That's got a marble tub, in case you like taking baths. Walk-in closets for him and her. And... And this is the master bedroom. So why are the owners selling an awesome place like this? Because it's ours. Was going to be. Mark bought this place when the company went public as a surprise for Anthony and I. Then why sell it? Because I hated it. You're right. It does feel really good to say that out loud. [chuckling] So sorry, guys. What'd I miss? Here we go, boys! Here we go, boys. Here we go! Set! Hut, hut! - [grunts] - [whistle blows] [coach] Good! Back to your huddles! - Elliot! - Yeah. Seventy-eight gap right. - Seventy-eight gap right? - Seventy-eight gap right. - Okay? Go get it. - All right. Uh, seventy-eight gap right. Seventy-eight gap right on two, boys. Ready? - Break! - Break! Um, hey, uh, I don't actually know what that is. Watch for the hole on the right. Go, boys. Here you go, boys! Ready, set! Hut, hut! [grunting] - Go, go, go! Go. - Go, go, go! [coach] Go, Anthony. Go! [man] Go... [coach] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [intense music] Oh, shit. Couldn't help but notice you running in before practice ended. Not much of a team-huddle guy? Where did you say you're transferred from again, Dylan? Coach might not care 'cause you got an arm, but everyone else knows you played somewhere before. What happened? You get caught in bed with one of the teammates? Huh? [scoffs] That why you're always hanging around your buddy, Anthony, right? - Close. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, I did get kicked off my last team because of a teammate, but it wasn't for sex. No? I shattered his leg in three places with my helmet. That's bullshit. A linebacker, like you. Thought it was fun to rough me up during practice, kind of the way you rough up Anthony, even though you know we're supposed to be goin' half speed. So one night I followed him into the locker room, kind of the way I followed you in here right now, made sure I didn't have to worry about him taking cheap shots anymore. Yeah, whatever. Coach offered to help his parents press charges against me, but they didn't want to. You know why? 'Cause they knew what I was capable of. Unlike you. [intense music] [indistinct chatter] [birds chirping] Oh, my God! Uh, uh, Dylan. I'm sorry. Anthony let me in. I can wait outside if you want. No, no, no, it's okay, I just, um, I wasn't expecting anyone. Uh, don't worry about it. I mean, you have nothing to be sorry about. It's your house. Uh, coffee? - Do you, do you drink coffee? - No. I mean, I do, but Anthony's really excited to get to the field, so I don't think we have time. What is it? I just don't remember the last time that Anthony was excited to be anywhere. I'm really grateful for what you're doing, Dylan. Morning. See you tonight, mom. - Morning. - All right, come on. I'll see you in the car, hurry up. Uh, maybe, I'll take you up on that coffee some other time. Deal. Okay. Oh. - Bye. - [knocking] I'm comin'. [intense music] You need to give this to Teddy. Look, I get why it could be a little awkward, but... A little awkward, Katie? He's been in love with me since grade school. I think I'd rather tell Mark about Landon a second time. Yeah, well, Mark was inhuman. I'm, I'm sorry. But, you know, Teddy's a professional. He'll-he'll have, like, professional detachment. No, he won't. At least he'll know what to do. Well, somebody knew about Mark cutting Jared out after the company went public. Everybody. Everybody knew about it. What about the whole Landon Hayes thing? I mean, how many people knew about that? There's no way that Landon had anything to do with this, Katie. I mean, I haven't spoken to him in years. And then all of a sudden, six months ago he decides he's so jealous he's gonna kill my husband? So have Teddy go ask him a few questions and cross him off the list. I mean, honestly, that should have happened six months ago, anyways. Do you remember what you said to me when you hired me? I think it was something like you were the most qualified candidate. "By miles, the most qualified," actually. Sharon, I was a high-school dropout with no family to speak of, too broke to take my GED. You didn't see a candidate. You saw a girl who needed help. I saw potential. You're a good person, Sharon. And one mistake with Landon Hayes, it-it doesn't change that. Several... mistakes with Landon Hayes. - I just need a little time. - How much? A day. Two? Forty-eight hours. I'm serious about this, Sharon. I told you we'd make it. [instrumental music] Hey, what's up? Gonna be a big boy and check out the roster or what? Have you checked it? Of course, I checked it. Seventy six. I like that number. Hey, Megan. What are you doing tonight? I don't know. Okay, it's simple, man. All right? Take charge, Do what you want. - [Dylan] Say it with me. - Take charge. - Take charge. - Take charge. Take charge, go! Go. - Go! - Uh, hey, Megan! Hey, are-are you walking to class? [Megan] Yeah. You wanna come? [intense music] - Hey, mom! - Oh, my Je... Hi. I-I asked Megan out today. - Really? - Yeah. We-we have a date tonight, we're going to this burger restaurant. - I'm so happy! - Well, that's, that's great! Oh, oh, my God, I gotta get ready. Okay, I-I'll see you later. [sighs] You look very handsome. I'm okay, I guess. You know I think you look more than okay, Anthony. You know what else I think? I think okay is great. [chuckles] - [crickets chirping] - [engine revving] Yes! - You ready? - Hey. Yes, definitely! Yes. Hey, man, thank you for letting us use the car. Well, just, uh, bring it back with an empty tank of gas and a used back seat. [Dylan chuckles] - Bye, mom. - Bye. Bye, Megan. [engine starts] Let's do this. Thank you so much for doing that, Dylan. Yeah, it's no problem. Just was gonna sit at home doing homework, anyway, so... At least now I'll have some help. Uh, nice try. I graduated. I don't have to ever do homework again. [Dylan chuckles] It was worth a shot. [upbeat music] [Megan] So what took you so long to ask me out? Well, you know, I was just, I was kinda waiting for the opportune moment. - Oh, really? - Yeah, you know... I-I didn't want you to think I was desperate or anything. Desperate for what? My attention? Exactly. So, um, so you're saying you don't, you don't want my attention. No, that's, that's not what I'm saying. - [chuckles] - Okay. - All right, Megan, all right. - Yeah. [gasps] Okay, well, you did not... I missed. I'm so... I have to get another. - Ooh! - Okay, all right. Oh, okay. Nice. Doing okay? Can I get you anything? Uh, the person who invented math, so I can murder him right here on your kitchen floor. Afraid I can't do that. - How about some of that? - I don't think so. - I'm good, thanks. - Well... Help yourself to anything, anything non-alcoholic. [Dylan chuckles] What, uh, what was he like? Chapter one. "Okay Is For Amateurs." You know that picture I turned around on my night stand? Yeah, what about it? Anthony had a 104 temperature that day. But Mark had been planning the trip for over a month, so he refused to reschedule or let Anthony stay behind. He gave some rousing speech about pushing through adversity. I mean, after that the matter was settled, didn't matter what I had to say about it. All Anthony ever wanted... was to make his father proud. - Of course. - Mark... meant well. Doesn't really matter what he meant, though, does it? [sighs] I guess not. Sounds like my uncle. You know, perfect shape, perfect job. Always makes the right decisions. Always, always disappointed in the people around him. Including me, my mom, the guy she married. But you know what I do when he gets like that? No. What? Something I'm not supposed to. [intense music] [exhales] That was fun! Yeah. It was. You still seem a little nervous. I mean, I'm-I'm not. Even after I made a mess of that burger right in front of you? I'm, I'm not. - [whispers] Take charge. - What? Wait... Are, are you okay? Yeah, I... I-I think I wanna... Slow down? - Yeah. - Sure. Hey. [crickets chirping] [water running] [intense music] Hello? [gasps] Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. You can't be here. [dramatic music] [Dylan] Then tell me to leave. [Anthony] Right here. [Megan] All right. [Megan] There we go. Oh! There we go. Thank you. Uh, I'm gonna get Dylan. And I had a lot of fun tonight, thank you. - Cool. - Yeah. Mom? Dylan? [Dylan] Hey, man, how'd it go? Oh, hey. So well, man. - She kissed me. - I thought she might. Well, I-I mean, I-I kissed her, but, uh, it was, it was that whole, that whole take-charge thing that you told me. That really gave me the confidence I needed to just, just go for it, man. - Perfect! - Thank you. Tell me, uh, about the details, what went on. [Anthony] Yeah, so, we-we get to this burger place. Of course, it's my favorite, I mean, I eat there, like, every week, but we-we sit down at my favorite table... [intense music] [rattling] [dog barking] [snoring] [printer whirring] [dramatic music] [cell phone vibrates] [kettle whistling] No Dylan? Uh, yeah, I've always wanted one of these. [Teddy] This is pretty awesome. It's great. - You could've come in. - Hey, good mornin'. Hey. Hey, Detective Barnes wanted to check out the car. And you know I can't resist showin' it off, so... Plus, I didn't wanna wake you. You had a big night last night. [chuckles] We should get going, come on. [indistinct chatter] He seems like a great kid. You know who he reminds me of? Bobby Richards. That was your lab partner with benefits, freshman year. Teddy... I'm sorry, I just, I just have a house to show. - Uh, so if there's any news... - Oh, oh, okay. So we had Jared Fields in about the cash withdrawal. - And? - I told him... It was totally informal. He wasn't a suspect. - Guess who he brings along? - His lawyer. [chuckles] On the advice of council, he's pleading the fifth on the cash. I mean, it doesn't mean anything until it does, but this could be it, Sharon. [sighs] How are you holding up? I'm just worried that he's still out there. I just hope that Anthony and I are safe. That's all. We are so close right now. I got this. [instrumental music] Hey, Megan. What do you want, Kilby? - See, I heard a rumor. - And I care because? 'Cause if I were you, I wouldn't wanna be associated with that loser, Anthony Elliot. Let alone be accused of dating him. [chuckles] It's true? Since when do I need to get approval from you over my dating decisions? - Yeah, but he's such a... - A what? You know his friend, Dylan, is a psycho, right? - I gotta get to class, Kilby. - No, I'm not playing. There's something wrong with him, seriously wrong. You don't believe me? I can prove it to you! Your mom still works in the front office, right? Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Crazy morning. Uh, ready to take another look? They were left on our doorstep this morning. We found them when we left the house to meet with you. Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, I'm so sorry you had to be bothered with this. - Wish we could say the same. - What do you mean? [sighs] Well, clearly, someone wanted us to know what kind of person we were about to do business with. Did you ever confess your affair to your husband, Mrs. Elliot? I fail to see how that's any of your damn business, Mr. Henderson. Okay. Let's go, hon. Hey, Theodore! Go Rock River Chargers, am I right? [intense music] Coach might be okay letting you on the team, no questions asked, but he can't ignore actual information! Do him a favor, Ted, and don't show up to practice. Save him the trouble of kicking you off the team. [Katie] Chickens and hatching. Good thing about the open house. Yeah, good thing. Let's make sure Dylan's uncle is there. Nate, was it? Yeah, I, uh, sent a couple of emails to the address Dylan gave us, but I haven't had a response. I mean, maybe I wrote it down wrong? No, I'll have Anthony check. Worst comes to worse, we'll just, uh, pay him a house visit. Walk the streets of Carmichael Heights, shouting, "Nate Warren!" [laughing] Yeah, we'll track him down. Look, I don't know if I need to remind you, but I'm going to anyways. It's been 48 hours, Sharon. [instrumental music] [exhales sharply] [Dylan] Anthony. Hey, what's up, dude? Why aren't you dressed yet? - Listen, I need a favor. - What is it? If I asked you to lie for me, would you do it? What? Yeah, I-I... I-it depends on what I'm lying about. Something really important, something that'll help me stay on the team. This is about Rockdale River? Would you do it or not? I need an answer. Yeah, I-I-I think so. You think so? [intense music] [laptop keys clacking] - Hey, you headed out? - Yeah. Well, I'm, uh, gonna go buy a cop a donut. [dramatic music] - Warren, where have you been? - Kilby! - Where the hell... Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - [clamoring] - Relax. Warren, what happened to your arm? Kilby cut it. [breathing heavily] [cell phone ringing] Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Elliot. Oh, my God! What? - [instrumental music] - Mrs. Elliot. - Thanks for coming in. - Teddy? Just getting a statement from the boys about the incident. Oh, my God! Dylan, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. - Anthony, did-did he... - No. I-I'm fine, mom. He didn't touch me. Just Dylan. Where's the knife? I don't know. He left the locker room with it. I'm assuming he stashed it somewhere on campus. But it's the same knife he's been threatening Anthony with all year. Anthony, is that true? Anthony, I can't tell you how important it's that you... Yes, it's true. Hey. I'll have a little talk with that Kilby kid tomorrow. And I got some deputies out searching the area between the locker rooms and the field. Sounds like the school's thinking expulsion based on the boy's reports, but I'm gonna have a little chat with the principal tomorrow just to make sure. You hear that, Anthony, you don't have to worry about that idiot comin' back to school anytime soon, so long as I have my say about it. Thank you, Teddy. - Those donuts for me? - Oh, um, uh... Y-yeah, I was on my way to bring them to you when the coach called. - Any special occasion? - No. Uh, nothing that can't wait. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Maybe tomorrow? I'm gonna hold you to it. But I don't want these to go stale. - Thanks. Thanks again, Teddy. - Okay. [engine revving] Why wouldn't you tell me? I specifically asked you if Brent Kilby was still bullying you. You don't tell me anything and you just, you expect for my life to be an open book. - I, I tell you things. - Like, what? Like, how you're not upset dad's dead? Excuse me? That's not true or fair. What-what about all the books that you ripped up and threw in the garbage, thinking I wouldn't notice? Hm? You wanna, you wanna tell me about those? Didn't think so. I hated your father's book. I hated it for how it made me feel about myself and I hated it for how it made you feel about yourself. I feel fine, mom. - No, you don't. - Yes, mom! I do! Did it, did it ever occur to you that maybe I wanted to be like dad? Of course, he's your father. But you never wanted me to. You think it's, it's perfectly fine to just be like you. What is that supposed to mean? That feeling bad about yourself isn't such a terrible thing. [voice breaking] He, he told you? About your real-estate boyfriend, yeah, dad thought I could handle the truth. [sighs] Anthony! Anthony! Anthony! [door slams] [sniffling] - [knocking on door] - Anthony. Come on, Anthony, open up. [cell phone chimes] [sniffles] - [cell phone chimes] - [scoffs] Oh... [dramatic music] [car door shuts] Where's your car? Parked it just a few streets down. Just in case. But, to be honest, I didn't think you were gonna show. [chuckles] Why? Because I'm not supposed to? [intense music] [Dylan chuckles] [door shuts] [instrumental music] Mom? Mom? [intense music] [wheels rattling] [music continues] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [doorbell rings] Dylan. Dylan. [doorbell rings] [intense music] Katie? What are you doing here? Uh, the open house is today. There's, like, a billion things to set up. - What'd you do, sleep here? - What? Uh, sorry. It's just, you're never here this early. - Are you doin' okay? - W-where are you going? Oh. I was just gonna go upstairs. These are some accents for the master bedroom. - Great, uh, I can do that. - Oh, no. - They're just throw pillows. - Don't say it's... - Really, I can do it. - There is some more boxes. In the car, if you really wanna help. Katie... Katie! [sighs] I-I did sleep here last night. Oh, um... Okay. Why? Anthony and I got in a really big fight. I'm really sorry, Sharon. Are you okay? - Yeah, I am. - Good. [intense music] Oh, do you wanna grab that side? Sure, of course. Ahem. [intense music] You left the office to go bring donuts to Teddy last night? - [chuckles] - Oh, my God. I told you he'd be able to look past the whole Landon Hayes thing. - Guess so. - So, how was it? Uh... Don't actually answer that. It's better if I don't ruin your image of Teddy anyway, so... - [Katie chuckles] - [Sharon clears throat] [indistinct chatter] Anthony! Anthony, wait up. - Hey. What's up? - Um... I-I have something I need to show you. Oh, okay. [instrumental music] Remember what Kilby was telling everyone at school? About Dylan before he got expelled? That he was lying about who he was? I was the one who got him the information. What? My mom lets me take naps in her office sometimes during study period. She's not supposed to. And she could get in big trouble for it, 'cause she has, like, every student file for the last seven years lining her... Megan, you-you-you pulled Dylan's file? Uh, Kilby said he was a liar. I wanted to prove him wrong. I thought I was doing the right thing. [Megan sighs] He is lying, Anthony. Dylan's 21 years old. He dropped out of his last high school three years ago before he could graduate, and his first name's not even Dylan, that's actually his middle... I-I-I guess I'm just confused as to why you have a video of Dylan making out with my mom, Megan. When I confronted him about it, he told me he could explain and asked me to meet him at this random house. It's not a random house. It's ours. It was. My mom is trying to sell it. Anthony... did Kilby really attack Dylan in the locker room with a knife like he says? Thank you for showing me this, Megan. - I know it must've been hard. - Wait, Anthony, hold on! We still don't know what's going on here. Dylan told me to meet him last night because he wanted me to see this. I mean, he had to know I would tell you! Megan, there's... There's no reason you'd know this, but... it's actually my mom's second affair, not the first. Oh. [Anthony] I don't know. There was some guy. Some real-estate mogul in Rockdale River a few years ago. Rockdale River? When you think about it, it's, it's really not all that life-changing. I'll-I'll see you around, Megan. - Detective Barnes. - [scoffs] It's all right, Brent, 'cause I already know who you are. What's the whole point of an in-school suspension? Aren't I supposed to be some kind of threat to my fellow students? That is a little bit above my pay grade. [chuckles] Yeah. - I was pushing for expulsion. - [chuckles] Yeah, well, I heard you're trying to screw Anthony's mom. So I don't expect you to be fair about all this. Do you have any idea why Dylan Warren would take a knife and cut himself and then pick a fight with you to make it look like you did it? Probably, because I know he's not actually Dylan Warren. Okay. [chuckles] Who is he? You don't believe me. [cell phone ringing] [sighs] Barnes. Yes, sir. Emails? [Megan] Yeah, so I think that I'm gonna do the packet, like, tomorrow night 'cause she's given us... It's, like, a good amount of time. Yeah. Hey, Megan. [intense music] - Enjoy the show last night? - [scoffs] Sure you got some pictures. Hey! Video. Even better. What are you doing? Just sending this to myself. Okay, look, I don't know what kind of game you're trying to play here, Dylan, but leave me out of it. I don't even, I-I don't even know who you are anymore. - I'm sorry, but I can't do that. - What? Leave you out of the game. [intense music] So, uh, what time do you think everyone will start arriving? Oh, probably, in, like, 30 minutes. I don't know, it shouldn't be too long. [cell phone ringing] Oh, it's the Hendersons. Maybe they had a change of heart. Hi, Jack. Yeah, I am so glad you called. Um... Yeah, Sharon and I both feel really bad about the way things ended and... [intense music] Katie, can you, uh, can you take that off our page, please? Yeah, o-of course. You know, maybe it's just a couple of high-school students watching it a whole bunch of times. [doorbell rings] Hey. I, uh, I tried the other house, so I figured... You okay? You-you didn't see the video? What video? I slept with... Dylan Warren. - Teddy, I... - Dylan Warren? The high-school kid? It's the worst thing I've ever done in my life and I... I guess somebody videotaped us kissing and posted it online, so now everybody knows. - I got kicked off the case. - What? That's what I came by to tell you. What? Why? Emails. Forwarded emails from your account. And, a-and I'm thinkin' it wasn't you, so... Whoever hacked into Mark's emails before his death must have had access to yours. - He does. - What? He left an email at my door. - When? - A couple of days ago. You didn't think this was pertinent goddamn information? [sighs] What the... [sighs] I-I ordered a police detail for your house until we can, uh... Well, until Frank... Do you know Frank Crews? Until Frank can get this figured out. They'll be there when Anthony gets home from school, and they'll, they'll stop by every hour or so. Teddy. Oh, and Jared Fields, he was payin' for sex. I guess it tells me now why he didn't wanna share that information with us. Which takes us back to square one and marks my complete and utter failure to solve your husband's murder. Teddy, I'm-I'm so sorry. No, you know, I got my wish, right? Now I get to go back to solving murders for strangers. [sighs] Uh, give Frank that email. He's gonna wanna see that. [footsteps approaching] I think I'm gonna head out if you don't need me to do anything else. Thank you, Katie. It would've been beautiful. I'm sorry I messed it up. There's no such thing as pro-all lifestyle, Sharon. There's just life. You know that better than anyone else. We can always push the open house back a week if you want. No. I don't think so, but thank you. [instrumental music] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [dramatic music] [engine revving] [music continues] [music continues] [dogs barking] [intense music] [clatters] [knocking on door] Hello? [whirring] Hello? It sticks. [dramatic music] [intense music] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chiming] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] [line ringing] [Anthony on voicemail] Hi, you've reached Anthony Elliot. I'm not at my phone right now, please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Anthony, it's mom, I know Megan said you didn't wanna talk to me, but would you please, please just call me back and let me know you're okay? I love you. [sighs] [instrumental music] [cell phone chimes] [intense music] [cell phone chiming] [Sharon] Teddy. Teddy, call me back. Um... I need you to meet me at the house. Uh, Mark's house. I mean, uh, uh, the one we're selling. [engine revving] [intense music] [indistinct yelling] [man] All right, now grab the ball, grab the ball. Okay now, you're gonna grab it and then you're gonna spike it, okay? Grab it and spike it. Spike it, go! - All right. Now... - [chuckles] One more time, one more time. Catch it. There you go... Hey, Landon. Long time. [dramatic music] Where's your car? I parked it down the street. Just in case. You told me you didn't have any family. Sure, that's true. [dramatic music] Is that... the knife you used to kill Mark? This is the knife... that my dad used to slit his wrist... in our bathroom... a couple of years after, after my... mom finished drinking herself to death. I figured it should end Mark's, too. Why? Why not just kill me? I don't wanna kill you, Sharon. I want you to do what my dad did. The honorable thing. I want you to kill yourself. - You're crazy. - Your husband's dead. - Because of you! - And you! If you hadn't seduced my dad, Mark would be home with Anthony right this second, alive and well. No. - Your career's ruined. - You don't know that. Yeah, but probably, though. Small town like this? Nobody wants to buy a home from a home-wrecker. [grunts] Teddy's gone. Definitely seems like you missed your chance with him. But I don't think you're gonna kill yourself because of that because I don't think you loved your husband. And, frankly, I don't think you're that interested in Teddy or selling houses. No, no, no. No, no, no. The reason I think you should kill yourself... is because your son... will never... ever speak to you again. [sobbing] You think he's avoiding your calls now? Just wait till he finds out that you're the one who got his dad killed. How do you know he's avoiding my calls? You have him. - I have him. - Where? Do the right thing... and I promise, he will go home tonight. [Sharon] I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about your father, Dylan. I really am. I'm so tired of men telling me what to do! [Dylan groans] [groaning] [breathing heavily] - Teddy! - Huh? Hey, yeah! - Dylan, Dylan killed Mark. I... - Where? Where? - He's in there. - Where? [dramatic music] [sobbing] - Teddy? - He's gone. - We have to go. - Where? We have to go. We need to get to Carmichael Heights. What are you doing? Trying to look up the DMV records. I've never... Well, here, let me do it. Let me do it. - I'm not supposed to let you... - Teddy! Ugh! How hard can it be to find a Nate Warren in a small town like this? [breathing heavily] Here, I got it. Make a left. [Megan] Anthony. Anthony, are you awake? [instrumental music] Why is Dylan doing this to us? I-I-I don't... I don't know. [grunting] Why does my head hurt so bad? [sighs] It's, uh... It's whatever he used to knock us out. It'll wear off, eventually. [crickets chirping] [Megan sighs] I'm... I'm sorry for... getting you involved in all this, Megan. It doesn't matter now. We need to find a way to get out of here. Is there anything in your pockets? No. No, he must have taken everything. God, I hate the idea of being unconscious around that creep! I-I-I know where we are. [intense music] [Teddy] No, I don't see his car. - That-that's Anthony's. - [Teddy] Stay here. Oh, yeah-yeah, okay. Right. - Sharon! Sharon! - Mr. Warren! Mr. Warren! - Open up! - [knocking on door] Mr. Warren, police! [grunting] - Anthony! Anthony! - Sharon! You know that's B and E, right? Arrest me. Anthony! [intense music] - Is he drunk? - Yeah, very. I-I found this in Dylan's room. Wherever he took Anthony, he... All right, we just gotta figure out where he would take him. To the school, to-to someplace where the, an athlete would have special access or... He'd be scared that a teacher or a custodian would walk in on him. No, he-he took him somewhere... - Remote. - Remote. Let's go. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] - I'm, I'm gonna try and stand. - Okay. [grunting] [grunting] Your rope's fraying. [both grunting] Just try to stand. It loosens the grip a little bit. Okay. [intense music] [engine revving] [Anthony and Megan grunting] It's right up here. [grunting] Come on, we're almost there, Teddy. - Come on. - I'm gonna make it. - Come on, give me your gun. - I can't do that. - Teddy, please. - Sharon, I love you. I love Anthony, but, by God, I can't give you my gun. Come on, I can't wait for you. Oh, come on. [inhales sharply] Sharon. [Teddy coughs] [breathing heavily] [intense music] [groaning] You were a good man, Teddy. [dramatic music] [leaves rustling] - You're too late. - No. I killed him and his girlfriend and I buried him where no one will ever find him. You are a liar. I don't believe you! You're the one I wanted to hurt, not Anthony! But once again you acted selfishly, and now his blood is on your hands just like Mark's. No! No! Anthony! Get out of here! - No, mom! - Here, come on. [breathing heavily] Anthony... I don't wanna hurt you. - You're gonna have to, Dylan. - Anthony, please... No, mom! Do you know what she did? She killed your father and mine! She's responsible for both of their deaths! No, Dylan, the only person responsible for your dad's death is your dad. No. No, no, no, she... Just like the only person responsible for my dad's death is you. You. [gunshot] [grunting] [grunting] [groans] [intense music] [groaning] [grunting] No, mom! Mom! No! Don't kill him! [breathing heavily] Like hell. [Anthony] I forgive you. Look, what you did was wrong... and the consequences we'll both be living with for the rest of our lives, but I forgive you. Here, come on. - Let's go home. - [Sharon breathing heavily] [Anthony] It's okay. Well, that's that. You really think this is gonna be your last sale? Katie, for so long, real estate seemed like the sort of thing the wife of the pro-all lifestyle guru was supposed to be doing. But I'm not the wife of the pro-all lifestyle guru anymore, so... It's time to stop thinking about what I should be doing and start thinking about what I wanna do. Anyway, Elliot-Harrison Real Estate is in good hands until I've got it all figured out. Um... Elliot-Harrison? Um, I can't have someone selling houses for me that isn't a full co-owner of the company. [chuckles] You're a good person, Sharon Elliot. - [cell phone vibrating] - Oh! I, I gotta go. Anthony gets back from practice in an hour and I've got a quick stop to make. Is it something I can help with? No. I'm just gonna go buy a cop a donut. [chuckles] [Teddy sighs] [door creaks] [instrumental music] - Hey. - Hey. Remember that kid, Teddy Barnes? Kind of pudgy, super immature and a little annoying? Remembers the name and class of every guy I've ever dated? Might ring a bell. I chose wrong, Teddy. And if I had to do it all over again... I'd make the same mistake because it gave me Anthony, and it made me who I am today, but that doesn't change the fact that... I never gave you a chance, and I'm sorry about that. Depending on how sorry you were... you can always give me a chance now. [chuckles] I-I'd love that. [instrumental music] [Sharon] Hey. How was practice? It was okay. Okay. Okay is great.
