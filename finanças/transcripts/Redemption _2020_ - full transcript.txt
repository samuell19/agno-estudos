Zoya. Zoya. Oh. Welcome to paradise. Zoya? Zoya. Liam! Liam! Yes, Father? Liam! Yes, Father? Did you get my stuff? Yes, Father. What took you so long? God. Kids nowadays. I'm sorry, Father. I got delayed on the way. Liam. When am I getting my... My real stuff? Soon. Soon? It's been a long dry run for me. You realize that, don't you? I have been busy. Busy. Back home in Ireland, my father used to say to me, "Son, unwillingness easily finds an excuse." I said soon. Fingers crossed. That's like a good boy. Did you sleep well? "The thief comes only to kill, and steal, and destroy. "I have come so you may have life. "And have it to the full." "For I am with you, and no one's going to attack and harm you." Let me go! Bastard! Just let me go! Let me go! Bastard! Let me go. Save your breath, my angel. It's pointless. We're far from civilization. My angel, in this dark place that you're in, I'm your knight in shining armor. Who are you? Who's that other man who tricked me into this? He's Conan. My brother. And you? Who am I? Isn't every one of us searching for that answer? "Who am I?" What's the time now? Someone once said, "To realize the unimportance of time is the gate to wisdom." What's the date today? Today is a memorable day. Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull have apologized to the Stolen Generation for the abuse, neglect and suffering endured all those years. What do you want? I just want love. That's all. My father can give you money. Lots of money. Aren't you afraid? The cops will come looking for you. The cops will come looking for my brother. Not me. I want to know the time. Love is timeless. It is priceless. It's very important in one's life. More than money. More than anything you can imagine. Do you know why King Edward VIII abdicated the British throne? In order to marry the woman he loved. Please tell me what time it is. And I'm no different to King Edward VIII when it comes to love. Can I have a cigarette? "Please." Please. Cigarette smoking is injurious to health. I'm dying for a smoke. Please? What you need is liquid. Not gas. Did you know, about 52 Australians die each day from smoking? I wish to die. Hello, sweetheart. Looking for me? Next time you scream, I'm gonna squeeze the life out of you. Do I make myself clear? Mmm. That's a good girl. My angel, I know life's not exactly exciting with Liam. But with me... Well, that's a different story. Liam! Have you heard the story about the frog in the boiling water? No? Well, if you drop a frog into boiling water, it will jump out immediately. Liam! But if you place a frog into normal water, slowly turn up the heat to boiling, the frog won't feel the heat change. It'll continue to play. But it will eventually die. Liam! Nice dress. But nice girls look lovely without them. Come here at once. Old man never stops. Where does he get the energy? Now where is Liam? Please save me. Please let me go back to my family. Or you can stay with me here. And your brother will not come back then. He's as good as dead to me. I wish I could stay with you, my angel. I've got to work on weekdays. Then you can help me escape. Everybody wants to escape from someone. Me, too. How I miss my mother. I'm afraid of Conan. And my father. Sometimes I wish they were dead. I wish I could give you a hug. Please. Please. Please. I know you can. You're a nice man. You're a kind man. I will do anything you say. I will do anything. Please. Please. Please. Please. Where were you all these days? I tried. I contacted your father. I knew you would. I tried to explain the danger you're in. I tried. At first, he wouldn't listen. But I persisted. But he's blindly refused to have anything to do with you. In fact... he's told everyone you've gone away to India. He does not want you back. He says you've brought shame on the family. They have disowned you. So, now you have no home. No family. I don't believe you. He says you've brought shame on the family. They have disowned you. So, now you have no home. No family. Papa? I knew you'd come. I love you, Papa. I love you, too, meri bacchi. Please help me. Out of my way, Pa. Why are you going in there? To play Monopoly. Don't upset Father. Conan, you know you shouldn't go in there. Oh, who will stop me? You? Or the old man? - Liam? - I'll deal with you later. I'll deal with you now. Can you not see the lady's waiting for me? Step aside, bro. Or else I will step over you. Wait, what's going on? Conan, I will protect her. Conan, I'm warning you. Stay away from her or I will... Don't you worry, sweetheart. I'll be back. Very soon. Liam! Liam! My angel, I'm so sorry. I can't bear to see you suffer. I'll gladly risk my life and take you back to your family. Only if... Conan's very evil. You don't know how I've survived all these years. Unloved... and in fear. Hello, Arif speaking. I'm really sorry, Papa. I'm really sorry. Please, Papa, help me! Please! Papa? "How could I deny my own faith and my beliefs? "On the other hand, how could I deny my own daughter?" Liam, please get my mail. It is so dark in here. My angel, it's not me who's making you a recluse. Just how many years must pass until a lie becomes the truth? "How many tears of sorrow must be shed "Until they turn to tears of joy? "Don't let the past destroy our chance "For the future, my angel don't be coy "Angel, let go Don't wait for any intervention "It is me and only me "Who can provide you with redemption" I'm back, sweetheart. - Good morning. - Morning. I'm Detective Singh. Detective Kollie. From the Darlington Police Station. Making inquiries of a missing girl. You are? Liam. Liam McFarlane. We would like to ask you some questions. Can we come in, please? Yeah, sure. How are you today? Liam. Do we have visitors? Yes, Father. We are detectives from the Darlington Police Station, making inquiries about a missing girl. Are you in trouble, Liam? - It's my father. - His name? Uh, Noel McFarlane. He used to work for a bank in the city. Where does he work now? Uh, he doesn't anymore. Um... He... He left the bank probably after my mother passed away. Things went downhill for him after that and, well... He's not been in the best of state since. He depends on me for everything. He used to have friends, but they're no more. Is anyone else staying here? Oh, no, it's just the two of us. Father and son. Officer, I... I swear on my dead wife's grave. God rest her soul. I've done no wrong. No one is doubting you. Can you please leave my dead mother out of this? Although he never leaves his room, he wants to know everything that's going on. Let me tell you about the missing girl. She has been missing for more than six months. Who's missing? She's 19 years of age. 158 centimeters in height, and small build. Last seen, she was wearing a dark top and ripped jeans. She's from Bathurst. Back home, no one went missing. Everyone kept a lookout for one another. But we're far from Bathurst. She's of Asian background, but she speaks English well. Have you see her? Sorry. Take a look. How long have you lived here? I... I was born here. And my father, he migrated from Ireland when he was young, after the war. And your mother? My moth... Mother was from Broken Hill. She was a beautiful woman. Angelic. I also had a brother, but, um, he died young. Why are you talking softly? Is anything wrong? He thinks everyone blames him for anything that goes wrong around hm. He had a nasty temper, and he often beat his wife, my... My mother. So, when she died in an accident, he thought everyone blamed him. D... Do you know the difference between an Irish marriage and an Irish funeral? There's one less drunk. Do you have any suspects? She was last seen with a Caucasian man sporting long hair and wearing a black cap. He was more or less affable. My angel... She... She... I'm his girlfriend. You mentioned only two of you live here. He's still not used to me being here. What do you mean? I've not been here for long. As we say, "See something, say something," if you see or hear anything suspicious. All right. I'll leave you guys to it. See you later. Conan is here. Hey, Liam. I'll tell you the four reasons why Jesus was Irish. First, he lived at home until he was 30. The second one, he thought his mother was a virgin. Third, just before he died, he went out drinking with his buddies. As we do. And the fourth one, his mother thought he was God! Hey, Liam. Are you off the hook with the cops? I don't know. You better don't involve me. Hey, do you know they're making Wolf Creek 2? Maybe the first wasn't creepy enough. Apparently it's based on the notorious outback serial killer, Ivan Milat. What is he saying? As for you, it's your duty to care for me. You owe it to me as a son to a father. What about me? You have a duty to care for me, too. Oh, jeez, you seem to have forgotten me. I am. You've been ignoring me... Oh, keep quiet, please! How? How? I spoke to Father. It took me a long time to convince him that Conan's presence in this house isn't good for any one of us. He's too violent. He must have brushed you aside, you poor thing. On the contrary. He's told Conan to leave this house forever. You're joking. We can now live happily. Happily ever after? Like they show in the movies? Oh, my God! Nothing is the same anymore. Sick, tired. What the hell? Sorry, Mr. McFarlane. I just came to thank you. What... What for? Regarding Conan? What? Are you out of your mind? No. You told Conan to... Conan has been dead 22 years. Why dig up the dead and buried? And why rub salt on my wounds? How many times I miss... How I miss my boy even now! How many times have I mentioned his name in these 22 years and wept! Conan! Conan! - Liam said... - Liam? He is the root of all evil, even Conan's death. Oh, God, how he disliked Conan! And how I hated Liam! Conan, the son I so much loved and wanted, but lost. Welcome home. Don't you like the new look? Mmm. Yeah. It's nice to change things now and then. - Change can be unsettling. - Not necessarily. Well, if change is just for the sake of change. But... Change is the law of life. This is my home, too. But... If you don't like the change, I will not... Oh, my angel, what have you done? How are you? I was passing through, and thought I didn't talk to your girlfriend last time. Is she around? Liam, is that the cops again? Yes, Father. Is she there? Can I come in, please? Uh, she just left. Who is it? Senior Detective Singh. I was told you had left. How can I leave? I have lots to do here. Where are you from? Detective Montalbano. Smarter than the fictional character. Originally from Lucknow. - India! - Yes. - Namaste. - Namaste. Zoya. I came here and I showed you a photo of a missing girl. Yes, I remember. She's still missing. You took up the photo and looked at it intensely. You seemed to recognize her. I thought she looked familiar. Have you seen her? No. It could be her dress that seemed familiar. Or maybe I'm imagining things. What about the dress? I don't know. We have information that she was seen in this neighborhood. Did you see her? Did you see her? This case is important to me. I knew Kathy's parents. This is my card. My details have changed. Congratulations. Thanks. Give me a call if you remember anything. Or if there is anything else you want to tell me. I better let you go now. We will get the guy. Thanks again. What? Cops and lawyers are a bad omen. Don't get upset. Of late, I cannot get the cops out of my mind. Why did he come back? Any idea? Like he said, he wanted to talk to you. He thought that I knew the missing girl. I'm getting sick of this. First, that Indian cop, and now, you. He's a Senior Detective. He seemed very intelligent. And a handsome man, too. You think so, do you? Are you jealous? No. You were uncomfortable when he was around. What were you thinking? Liam! Come here at once. What now? Why? Because you've become a bad son. I'm busy now. You're always busy nowadays. Later. Later. I'll be dead by then. I swear I'm gonna kill him one of these days. Maybe you should. I need a drink. Do you want one? I know you want me dead. You have no time for me, but you have all the time in the world for that whore! What are you doing here? You don't love me anymore. I do! On my dear mother, I love you more than anything. I often daydream about our family. Can I ask you something? Anything you want. I just need your love. Thank you for everything. My angel, my love, you don't need to thank me. Everything here is yours. I don't need everything. I just need you. You can do whatever you want. And go wherever? Of course, my angel. You're not a prisoner here. I feel like one, locked. I looked after you when you were young. Now, it's your turn. Why aren't you going to work? The last few weeks, all you've done is play with your toy. Poverty waits at the gates of idleness. I lost my job. And I'm looking for another one. Why? You wouldn't understand. You don't want to understand. Companies are trying to do more with less. It's no different now from then. To make matters worse, these fucking migrants are everywhere, taking everything. Mind your language, young man. At this rate, it may be a long while. - What are you doing now? - I'm busy. Busy with your doll? "Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, "and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles." He's never made it easy for me. - He's always treated me like... - A child? Worse. Like shit. I don't know what to do. What do you want to have for lunch? We need to talk. I'm talking to you, Liam. Half the morning is gone, and you're still in bed. Remember what your father said? Lose an hour in the morning and you'll be looking for it all day. What's the point in brooding all day? In the last few weeks, you've hardly stirred. Who will give you a job if you don't try? No one has achieved anything without trying. - Oh, don't start this again. - I don't want to. But how long can you provide for us on government handouts? Can't we survive on the dole? - Shame on you! - Oh, what should I do? Do you have any plans? My angel, please don't leave me. I love you very much. Here's an idea. Borrowed from a Korean movie I'd seen. It's about an unemployed guy with little savings, and he has a wife and a young son to support. So he tricks his insurance company and makes claims. How is that possible? Insurance is paid for death and injury. So, kill. Or someone gets hurt. Not quite. Don't worry, let it be. Stories have a purpose. Not always. Tell me anyway. The guy cuts off one of his limbs and lodges a claim to the insurance company. And then, he does it again. Why would he do that? All for his loved ones. Sorry. My father and I watched a lot of movies on TV. Both of us loved Korean movies. How come you don't even have a TV? Don't you sit in pubs and watch rugby like other Aussies? No. Pubs and parties are frivolous. And rugby? It's too violent. Some TV shows are interesting. It's a complete waste of time. No wonder it's called the idiot box. Moreover, what upsets me more, the world is just so full of bad news. Oh. What bothers you? There's just so much hatred out there, for no reason. War, terrorism. Hmm. The world's a mess. And it's so complex. My father reminisces about his childhood growing up in Ireland. Just makes me think we've lost that simple world, you know? I wonder what happened with the missing girl. Did the cops find out? Her name is familiar. Kathy, remember? How do you expect me to know about her? The cops showed her photo. Can we please stop this discussion? It's just that I seem to know something. Just don't know what. Sorry. Okay? Well, I'm going to take a quick shower. Won't you join me? Back home in Ireland, children took care of their parents. Here, I have to kick and scream to get anything. What do you want? You can't even provide me with what I want. You're as useless as tits on a bull. What a shame. We've had this conversation before. No more! - Why not? - Please. I know why not. Because you want it. Give him what he wants. Stay out of this. No matter what I do, it's never enough. I wish Conan was here. He would've done everything for me. Why does he ridicule you all the time? You are a disgrace as a son! After all I have one for you, this is what you have to say? Yes! Yes, and yes! She is the source of all evil. She's bewitched you! Turned you into a horrible son! Get rid of your doll. Right now! You are evil. You are the devil. Help! Help me! Liam! If you confess your sins, He is faithful and just, and will forgive your sins and purify you from all unrighteousness. So, confess. Serves you right. Help me! Help! I am going to kill you. Angel! Where are you? I need your help. Angel, why are you hiding? You don't have to be afraid. We can now live without fear. No! Since I was a child... Father kept me in a dark room. I've been afraid of the dark ever since. I brought you light. I brought you food. I brought you out of the dungeon. Remember? I really thought you were my knight in shining armor. You tricked and deceived me. It wasn't me, it was Conan. My angel, please. Please help me. Please don't do this to me. You love me. And I love you. "You have heard that it was said, "'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'" Do you know the meaning of my name? Liam. Comes from William. It means "strong protector." I protected you from all evil. You had no chance of escape if I hadn't helped you. Did you tell me a story about a frog? I'll tell you another story of a frog. One day a frog fell into a pail that was half-filled with fresh milk. The sides of the pail were high, and the level of the milk was too low for the frog to jump out. He kicked and screamed. There was no one to help the frog escape. And he grew tired. But every time he quit kicking, he sank into the milk and started to drown. So he kept kicking. Do you know what happened? Something strange happened. The milk began to turn thicker around him. At first, this made kicking even harder. But the frog didn't give up. Finally, the milk had turned thick enough for the frog to stand on top of it instead of sinking in. The milk had been turned into butter through all the kicking and turning and churning of the frog. The frog was able to climb out to safety... and return to his family. I have loved you every moment. Believe me. Please. Save me again. You saved me once. Please save me again. Angel, no. No! "You have heard that it was said, '"Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'" "But I tell you, love your enemies "and pray for those who persecute you, "that you may be children of your Father in heaven. "He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, "and sends rain on the righteous and unrighteous." Papa. - I'm sorry, Papa. - I missed you so much. - I'm sorry, Papa. - I missed you so much. I'm sorry, Papa. I'm sorry, Papa. A missing girl, Kathy Young, has been found wandering near her home in Bathurst. She had been missing for almost three-and-half years, and appeared disoriented and severely malnourished. Not much is known about her disappearance at this stage. Police? Please. Please help me. My angel, she's gone crazy. She has sworn to kill me. God, I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her.
