Oharu? You couldn't catch a man? It isn't easy to disguise the age of 50 You aren't the only one who's that old An old man just called me to a cheap inn Then? I was glad I could get some business I went in with him But then He shined the lamp in my face The lamp? Then he told all the men there "Look! She wants to hide her age! "You want to play around with this worn-out old crow?" That's what happened An incident in my lost life I feel so sorry for you Look! He's making a fire! Let's get warm before going home Old man let us get warm Did you ever think you'd end up like this? I heard you worked at the Imperial Court when you were young What made you end up like this? Don't ask me about my past Making fires again! All right. But be very careful Don't get upset. If you worry too much, you'll lose your... No - you've no hair to lose Where to? - dressed up so? I'm going to offer at a temple on behalf of my master You rarely get a chance to go out You should take your time and see the sights I'd be scolded if I did that You could pretend to... You're going home early, Lord Kikukoji Nishinotoin is worried because you don't answer him He tells you everything doesn't he? I suppose he sent you an impudent poem What was it? I don't know. Excuse me. Wait! Please wait! I am Katsunosuke. Sorry to disturb you but Lord Kikukoji wants to see you Please call at the house of his friend in Teramachi I'm sorry, but I have to go to the temple for... We know. But on your way home... It will only take a moment. Please. He'd appreciate it Miss Oharu... Did you read my letter I gave you the other day Of course not. Who'd read a letter from a mere page? I burnt it without reading I've no talent for writing clever poems I can't even joke well But I am loyal and sincere. You can despise my low rank But you can't ignore my devotion If you think devotion... the same as a courtier's sport and call it regal... Well, I'm not... You'll never know the meaning of regality or elegance You can't understand the taste of the nobility. Then, may I ask who among the court nobility truly loves you? Would marry you? Wants to make you happy? Go home! I'm saying this because I want to see you happy Never mind me! If you really dislike me as a person I'll let you alone But if you dislike me for my low position then I'll never give you up Go away! Oharu, listen... a human being a woman - can be happy only if she marries when there is true love Social prestige isn't happiness I want you to leave! I didn't come here to listen to you! I'll wait alone for Lord Kikukoji I said leave Lord Kikukoji's not coming Please wait! I'm sorry But I had to see you. I just had to Ever since you started coming to the Imperial Court I've wanted you desperately Please accept my love for you I read your letter But no matter what you say we could never marry Why not? It's obvious Neither the Imperial court nor my father would permit us to marry Then, let's elope. It's the only way We'll make our own home We can do it I know I can make you happy Welcome Police I hear prostitutes use this house That's ridiculous! Who said so? I'll check it Who are you? A traveler. Are you a retainer? Yes. Of the Todo of Iga My name is Inosuke, of Yasui Prostitute - you look like a lady Where are you from? Ape! I'm not a prostitute! I'm a daughter of Shinzaemon Okui, a samurai serving Chion-in Temple Come with me "Oharu Okui, despite the fact you are in the service of the Imperial Court you are guilty of misconduct with a person of inferior rank Because of this grave offense you cannot reside In the city of Kyoto. this court therefore sentences you to exile Also to be exiled are Oharu's parents as punishment for their lack of proper parental supervision This judgement effective today the 7 of November 1686. Magistrate Itakura, Chief, Religious Admin Be quiet! You stop! Relatives can't go farther to see them off! Because of you, we have to live in shame! You've completely destroyed our family honor The shame of it! Why is it wrong, if a man and woman are in love? Why call it immoral? What? You went to bed with a man without our consent! What could be worse? What if our ranks do differ? If we truly love each other why is it bad? Shut up! Have you anything to say? Yes. Will you give a message to Oharu? All right. What is it? Please find a good man and have a good life with him But... be sure to marry only when there is true mutual love Is that all? No more? I hope the time will come When there is no social rank! And men can love! Oh! My dear Oharu! A man from the office He brought Katsunosuke's last will But keep it a secret from Father Stop! What are you doing?! Let me go! Take your hands away! Wait, Oharu! Let me alone! Wait I'll go to Katsunosuke! Stop! You musn't kill yourself! Death isn't the way! Let me die! - Who's he? - From Lord Matsudaira Matsudaira? Messenger from Edo Show him to the drawing room at once I'll get ready Leave us alone I'm honoured, sir On what mission...? I'm looking for a mistress for Lord Matsudaira. A mistress? Yes You rushed here to find a mistress? This isn't a joke Lady Matsudaira is incapable of bearing children It is said that if the Lord has no heir, the clan will be ruined It's a serious matter Some girls from the fief offered themselves to the Lord But he didn't like any of them Then all the retainers agreed that Kyoto is famous for women So they ordered me to come here and find a real beauty Is that so? I thought you came to place a big order for something expensive Your mission seems like a rather simple one I'm afraid it isn't so simple There are so many conditions My master has said that he wants to have a girl like this I see Her age should be between 15 and 18 She must have a round face Her eyes must not be too small Good eyebrows, and the space between her eyes must not be too narrow Nice nose, small mouth and a complete set of even white teeth And of course, if her ears stick out or are too large she'll be rejected Long neck without straggly wisps of hair Long artistic fingers with lovely nails Sounds like a difficult order There's more. Really? Dainty, tender little feet, without odour, 21 or 22 centimeters She must have a lush roundness at the waist nice bell-shaped hips, you know In short - gorgeous, and without a single mole on her body Artistic fingers Mouth too big - How old are you? - 25 A little old woman. Face too long. Has the round face. But with a mole. Nose is twisted Flat-nosed! A mole! Hairy! Your foot size? 25 Centimeters It's really too bad Her chin is too sharp I hate to boast about myself, Nobody but I could collect so many beautiful girls like these even in Kyoto These are the best available in the city Won't you choose one of them? Isn't there one? Only to get an heir any girl should do so long as she's healthy Good eyebrows, and the space between the eyes Small mouth with an even set of white teeth You have it memorized I'll die before I can find this ideal woman I'm sorry for you But I can't understand why they sent you on this difficult mission You can't? A younger man might... do something But me - what could I do to her on the way back... if I find her? What's that? A blind man from Edo is teaching singing and dancing to girls of good families The girls are popular among the samurai and serve at their parties Please, a moment. Look there. Have you any moles on your body? Moles? No, I haven't None at all? None. Kahei! The search is over! I'll buy her The messenger from Edo is waiting to hear your answer I'll go back and tell him you're willing I'm so glad for you If she bears him an heir It will bring happiness not only to your daughter, but to you, too And of course to me, her new godfather Thank you very much I'm so very glad that you can help us We must be truly thankful It's really unexpected good luck Oharu, this will completely offset your past wrong I won't curse you any more We never thought dancing could be so lucky That's right. We didn't You'll be paid 100 ryo cash And you'll get a good allowance What's wrong? Aren't you happy, Oharu? I'm to be a concubine, am I not? What of it? He's a great Lord You were in the Imperial Court, so you know If a lord favors you, you'll be given a high rank In your case you'll be expected to bear a male heir You'll be especially well off That's right I'd better go and ask the Court to keep her secret before Lord Matsudaira's investigation begins. The temple, too Yes, of course Then, let's think about what to buy and what to carry to Edo Come on Oharu I don't want to go. What? Going to a man I don't know just to bear his child It won't be an ordinary child. He'll be heir to a fief Katsunosuke won't permit it How absurd! You still speak of him! Well, regardless of what you say, I accept the offer Her body has matured well She is capable of bearing a child Then, Kazui instruct her in court manners And take her to Lady Matsudaira the messenger has returned from Kyoto with a girl to be the concubine Really? How quick! Indeed. She is waiting to see you Will you receive her? Please be tolerant for the sake of the Clan Her name is Oharu Okui Oharu - raise your face and greet her Ladyship You may go now Let her sit here Do you like the music? Didn't expect to hear Kamigata music here, did you? Do you like the food here in Edo? If there is anything you don't like, just tell them A baby boy is born It's a boy Inform the household office Certainly Wonderful news! A baby boy is born! A boy! How wonderful! We must inform His Lordship at once A very sweet baby. He's just like you. Really? Is His Lordship pleased about it? Of course. He seems very happy When I was first brought here, I felt lonely and ever so sad But now I've borne a baby No. You must say "I have been caused to bear a baby." Since I've been caused to bear a baby I feel this is my home for the first time His Lordship must be... It is most favourable for the sake of the Clan I'm very glad Where are you taking him? I mean the infant heir? I'm going to nurse him No, no! I can nurse him myself! Thank you I'll make a profit with this silk But don't worry about payment Lord Matsudaira will back me up financially but my master is very strict You mean Kahei? Listen - my daughter just gave birth to a baby boy Gave birth to the heir to the Matsudaira Clan The heir to the Clan? I just got the news I don't have to worry about money now so just bring me what I order Congratulations. I'm very glad to hear it Shall I bring goods from Hishiya, too? Well Of course. You can bring me whatever you like Some day I'll open a shop in Kyoto to rival you Anything wrong with the concubine? Since she had the baby, His Lordship's love for her has grown Nothing wrong Except... His energy seems to be draining from him The doctor says if she continues to live with him His life may be shortened That's bad. Since the heir is born, she's of no further use here Don't you agree, Isobe? For the sake of the Clan, send her home Understand? She's been sent back here for good? Are you sure? I don't know what to say I was so glad. I really felt proud when she had the baby I'm very sorry. So you're back After you bore them their heir you shouldn't have been so eager to satisfy His Lordship Anyway, it's all over now. How much did they give you? 300 ryo would be a fair amount What? Only 5 ryo?! I bought a lot of things I was planning on you being rich Now I'm up to my neck in debt Oharu, will you help me by being a courtesan at Shimabara? As soon as I earn enough money, I'll take you back You mean you'd actually sell your own daughter? I'm sorry, but there's no other way She's only just come back after being disillusioned. And now this... Welcome. I've always wanted to enjoy myself at Shimabara I've worked so hard every day - from before dawn until late at night for more than twenty years I've been saving my money And now I think I've saved enough So I came here all the way from the province of Eschigo I'm very sorry, but we have no vacant rooms What a beautiful courtesan! Just like a picture Besides, our place is very expensive Isn't my money good? Look! More than good! So much money! Welcome, sir. I'm the owner Is that so? Make preparations in the large room You serve him the best food, and give him Shizuhata, the most beautiful courtesan. Hurry! Welcome. Thank you for staying with us I want my men to have a good time, too. They came a long way Pack horse men - I see I have my own wine. We use the best wine available, thank you Thanks. Never mind that. Let's get down to business. Why don't you pick them up? Here. You were very rude to him! I wasn't rude! He was! I am not a beggar! Wait! Hey! You know how you're supposed to entertain men. You too good for that? You're not here for your own enjoyment. And don't be so proud of your ancestors. For all I know you could be a junkman's child. What? You call me the daughter Of a junkman? You're bought and paid for You're no different than a fish We can prepare and dispose of you as we like He gave you money - good! All right. As of now you're through working here! What'll your boss say to that? After being fired by me, no one in the area will ever hire you as a courtesan It was all my fault. I'm sorry Please, forgive me I'll change my attitude. I promise Only, please don't tell No. I can't stand you any longer Master! The gentleman is calling the courtesan I'll give him a better courtesan No. He says he likes this one very much He's never know a girl to refuse money He wants to buy her Buy her? You heard what he said. Please reconsider and serve him Let's go up Be nice to him, please Are you sure you want to redeem me and take me to Echigo? Yes - I'll take care of you Actually, I came to Kyoto to find a wife So I'll take you with me as my wife If you're sincere and you really like me then I'll serve you as best I can Why do you laugh? Money! Money! With money I can control things and people just as I choose Everybody kowtows politely before money Even a conceited woman like you You think I'm avaricious, but I'm not I want to be with you because... I can buy you with money Fortune has begun to smile on you Money is everything There is nothing greater You fraud! No wonder you're spending so much! He's a known counterfeiter! Your money is bogus!
