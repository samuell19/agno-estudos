ISLAMIC BOARDING SCHOOL And never will any Muslims follow the Jews or the Christians. Therefore, they will never approve of us until we, the Muslims, follow their religion. It doesn't mean that we need to oppose the Jews and the Christians. This verse, however, reminds us, the Muslims, to always be aware of the Jews and the Christians. We may refuse to follow their religion, and we have to stand up for ourselves when they oppress us. But if they're kind and respectful to us, we need to be kind and respect them as well. Let's go home. MOTHER THE THRONE VERSE, QURAN The Gaza Strip has turned into chaos. Israeli troops, along with their tanks and artillery, are reentering Palestinian soil. Hamas fought back, and battle broke out. Twelve Palestinian soldiers have been shot dead. One Israeli soldier was hit by stones and got wounded. Responding to that incident, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said... Hey, turn it off. You're committing a sin. Why have they been enforcing this rule for so long? Why can't we listen to the radio? If they keep doing this, how can we develop ourselves? If you want to improve yourself, hit the books. We still have the last exam tomorrow. We'd better read our textbooks while we're waiting for 10 o'clock since we'll be going out then. WHOEVER IS PATIENT WILL BE LUCKY Will this pillow help? We've been doing it for years. Never will the Jews and the Christians approve of us, the Muslims, until we follow their religion. The Israelis and Americans will always be hostile to us. They will ill-treat us if we don't follow their religion. They have poisoned Muslims in every way imaginable. They have destroyed Muslim people's morals with indecent TV programs and movies. They even boldly kill the Muslims in Palestine, Iraq, and also in Afghanistan. Therefore, it's permitted to kill the infidel Jews and Christians. Glory be to Allah. I don't think I will go to that one again. Me neither. Why not? I don't think what he said is true. It's different from what Romo Kyai taught us. DON'T BE NOISY EXAMS IN PROGRESS - It's over. - What a relief. - We just need to wait for the result. - Yeah. Hey, guys. Wait for me. Yay! You've finally finished it. ABDULLAH, 1422 This will be the last time we write here. You know, I'll never forget this place. What do you want to do? What will you do? I'll get a job to help my mom. She's all alone. I plan to continue my late father's business. What about you? Do you still want to find your mom? Absolutely. What about you, Hid? What do you have in mind? Well, just like my name, Syahid, I want to die as a shahid and then go to heaven. Die as a shahid, go to heaven. How nice. What are you looking at? What do you mean? Gosh, Rian. - What is he looking at? - A girl. Do you want to take a look? 1 MUHARRAM 1417 - 1420 H MS. ROHIMAH 1 MUHARRAM 1420 H, VIDEO CAMERA 1 MUHARRAM 1421 H, MR. AMIN 1 MUHARRAM 1422 H, MS.

It will be such a shame if we can't pull this off. The joke is on me. People will think I couldn't teach you guys. Zaki. Please give me your A-game. Okay, I will. C'mon, let's do it again. Three, four. HOSPITAL Wake up and pray. - What are you doing? - C'mon, pray. In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Ya, Allah, don't let me live by myself, please? And You are the perfect heir. In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Ya, Allah, don't let me live by myself, please? And You are the perfect heir. Huda. You've been living for six years in this Islamic boarding school. I've been taking care of you all these years. I do hope you will stay for a while here. We need you here. If I may, I ask you to please stay here. I have come up with a plan for you. But sir, I... I'll wed you to my daughter, Farokah. But that would be later, when the time comes. Not now. I have thought about it for quite a while. By the way... Here, take it. You can spend it. You have spent all the money I gave you, right? Here you go. Take it. SATURDAY: ENGLISH, MUTHOLAAH (REPETITION). SUNDAY: MAHFUDZOT (MEMORIZING), TARBIYAH MONDAY: PHYSICS, FIQH A long time ago, I told my dad that I would go and study at a boarding school. But in return, he had to buy me a Handycam. I forgot that wish when my dad started to get sick... and then passed away. Well, it turned out my mom still remembers my wish. Why are you so quiet? What is that for? My dad used to have a wedding photography business. It wasn't bad. It was quite big. I plan to rebuild his business. I want to establish a wedding photography business. But, gee... How do you use this? What's that sound? - Not sure. - Something came out. What is this? It should be put inside. - What? - Rian. Rian! What you're doing is sinful. - What do you mean? - Hey. Rian. I can't see myself. Okay, that's enough. Are you kidding me? James Bond? Ha! Hey, tonight's dinner is on me. Okay? We'll celebrate my birthday. Okay then. - I don't think I can join you, guys. - Why not? Is it another wrongdoing? Hey, guys. Where's your friend? - You mean Syahid? - Yeah. By the way, ma'am, I'll order takeaway for him. - Okay. - Okay. PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER DOODLING IS PROHIBITED Hello? It's me, Rian, Mom. Are you feeling well, Mom? Yes, Mom. I received your present. Where did you get the money? It's expensive. Is your photo studio doing well? I beg your pardon? You're coming here? But when? Can you repeat that, please? There's a surprise for me? What surprise? Okay, then. I'll be waiting for you, Mom. Okay, bye now. Peace be upon you. IKHLAS TELEPHONE KIOSK How's your mom? Is she doing well? Well, sort of. She's still running that small photo studio by herself. How about your mom? Are there any updates? Nope. She's in Jakarta, obviously. She told me that in her last letter. When was that? Gosh, about a year ago. Oh. So, you still want to go and find her? Yes, definitely. I'm sorry to tell you this, Da. Your mom left you a long time ago. She doesn't take care of you. Do you remember what Romo Kyai said? "Heaven lies under the feet of your mother." So whatever happens, we have to respect our mother. Sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that. Hey. There's a fair and an open-air cinema at the subdistrict square. They just got here last night. They will be here for about two weeks. Let's go there. I hope, my dear lover Will understand and allow me to leave To chase my dreams In pursuit of my dreams Love or dreams, love or dreams Dreams or love Love or dreams Dreams or love I've been thinking about it For a long time And now I have made my decision For the sake of my future I have to leave you, my love For the sake of my dream I'm willing to leave love behind For the sake of my dream I'm willing to leave love behind I hope My dear lover Will understand and allow me to leave To chase my dreams For the sake of my dream I'm willing to leave love behind For the sake of my dream I'm willing to leave love behind BALL BOOTH It's scary, isn't it? How dare you? Ouch! Ouch. - Okay, let's go home. - No, I'll stay here a bit longer. Why don't you go home? Here. Please give it to Syahid. Okay, then. I forgot about that. We hung out together. Watch out! Be careful. You'll break it. Your camera is a beauty, sir. I also own a camera. It's not a camera. It's a film projector. A camera can be used to record something but a projector can't. Where are you from? I live in a boarding school not far from here. You're a student there? What are you doing here? You're supposed to read the Quran, right? What's your name? My name? My name is Rian. Muhammad Rian. I'm Toha. It's from Rian. Thank you. Who are you looking for? Are you looking for me? Dona. I'm Huda. Are you a student? Yes, at that Islamic Boarding School. You're not from here, right? I was born here. But when I was a kid, my dad took me to Jakarta. Jakarta? You live in Jakarta? Well, not anymore. But one day, I'll go back there. What are you doing here? I'm on a pilgrimage to a grave. I also sing at the fair. Whose grave? My mom's. Hey, where's my shirt? I'll wash it first. - There it is. - Yeah, right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey. Syahid. I'm going back home. My little brother will have a circumcision. Why don't you take my meals? Okay. I'll be back here when Kyai Ridwan gets married. All right. Be quiet! Hey! It's too loud. Hey, skinny! Be quiet! Why isn't your name listed here? Whose meal are you taking? Hey. Whose meal are you taking? Mulif's. He's in his hometown now. - Have you asked for his permission? - Yes. Hey, what's up? What are you doing? It's my mom's address in Jakarta. MRS. ROHIMAH I'd like to ask you for a favor. Could you help me find this address? You've lived in Jakarta before. But I don't have time for this. I have to sing. Besides, I haven't lived there for quite a while. Please help me. I can't look for her by myself. But maybe I can ask my friend who lives in Jakarta. But it will cost you. Here. How could your mother leave you? Why did she leave you? I have no idea. She's not being responsible then. I believe she didn't mean to. She wouldn't mean to harm me. She might have thought this was for the best. She thought it was for the best? - By leaving you behind? - It's possible, isn't it? It's weird. How old were you when she left you? I was 11 years old. Six years ago, she asked Romo Kyai to look after me. Since then, she's never come to see me here. Why don't you go and look for your mom yourself? Well, that was my plan. But Romo Kyai... Well, I just can't. Besides, I don't know Jakarta. I could get lost. Thank God we met. But are you sure that your friend can help me find that address? I'll let you know in a few days. How are you doing, Dad? My blood is now being checked at the laboratory. We'll know what's wrong with me when we get the results. By the way, how's school? I've just finished doing my exams, Dad. - We're waiting for the results now. - Great then. How about you staying there? Next month, I'll be leaving the boarding school, Dad. Thank God. Ya, Allah. I'm so grateful. May He grant you recovery and health. I heard there are female ghosts here. Kuntilanak! What is it? Who is she? Who is this? Who are you? Hey, wake up. Get up. Why don't you go home? The movie is over. Hello, sir. Here, drink this. So you feel warm. Do you like watching movies? Yes, sir. Why did you ask me that? Oh, just asking. I had a son once. If he were still alive, he would be around your age. He came with me wherever I went. He was good at operating the projector. I'd love to learn how to operate the projector. If you don't mind. I mean, if you're willing to teach me. Well... My dad was also around your age. Or would have been if he were still alive. My friend found your mom's address. She rented that house once, but now... she no longer lives there. The owner of the house gave my friend your mom's new address, but the address is not clear. My friend can try to find your mom's new address, but it will cost you again. All the money you gave me was used to find the address. You don't have to pray like that. You think we're in Arabia? Zaenal, if you keep doing this, I'll send you back to your parents. Why do you leave this school at night? What are you saying? You leave this boarding school every night, right? It's not me, Romo. I never leave this school at night. Okay then. Now go and fetch 100 buckets of water. Fill up all the water storage tanks, for bathing and also for wudu. - But sir... - That's the reward. Just go and do what I asked of you. What wrongdoing have you committed? Romo Kyai thinks I've been leaving this school at night. I've never left this school at night. I just stay here. Okay, let me help you. Huda. Do not help Zaenal. Zaenal, come here. Listen. Anybody who does something wrong must pay for what he's done. You must do it yourself. Don't involve anybody else. Do you understand? - But Romo, Zaenal didn't... - Stop it. I don't want to hear it. Do what you have to do. Go on. Zaenal. Don't fetch any more water. Perform the Shalawat prayer right there. I think it's enough. It's good. But surely we need to step it up. I'll see you all at Kyai Ridwan's reception. Every single night Your face comes to mind Leaving me restless Restless and uneasy Every single night I scatter my dreams and fantasies To be with you Navigating our life together Love C'mon, shake your body. Thank you. All right. Till we meet Dona Satelit again at another event. Come on, Dona! You waited for me? You wanted to see me sing? I hope it's enough. I seek forgiveness from Allah. You have worked like this for so long? It's been a year. Well, I wanted to become a soap opera star or an actress or at least a model. What's wrong? You think it's an indecent job? No. Of course not. I've auditioned many times. But I haven't succeeded. I have another audition to do next week. What did you say? "Audition"? A person who wants to become a model or a soap opera star must undertake a selection process. It's a kind of exam. It's burdensome. I have to fill out forms or send my photos or send video tapes. Well, if I have any. One of my friends has a video camera. A Handycam. That's good. I've got an idea. Ouch. Don't laugh. No way! You're so annoying! You're a criminal! Hello, honey. How are you doing? You're so funny. I'm so sad. So sad. It's all because of him. Gosh! What a jerk! It's so unfair. That's it. I want to see it first. Rewind it, please? What a jerk! It's so unfair. Don. - Don! - Yes? You're really helping me find my mom, right? Yes, sure. I asked my friend to help me out. He has to undergo a kidney transplant. It costs a fortune, but there's no other option. And it may not succeed. We have to take him to Jakarta. What if he can't do that? He'll have to have hemodialysis. How long does he have to have it for? For the rest of his life. Please get me some water. Thank you. Yesterday, Sumarji visited me. He said somebody was interested in buying our paddy field. But I don't know who. Why don't you go and see Sumarji? Just do what you think is best for us. Okay. My dad says the market price is higher. He doesn't know what he's saying. I beg you, sir. I'll definitely sell it. But not at that low price. Gee. All the paddy fields surrounding your father's have been sold. The price was the same as what I offered you. And it's paid for in cash by Mr. Su. If you don't believe me, ask the man himself. But I can't pay the hospital bills with that money. Well, take it or leave it. Okay, then. Here. Inside this envelope is a check. You can directly exchange this with money at the bank. Here, please take it. Here you are. Okay. Now, I just need your father's signature. Okay, then. That's all. Great. You're handsome. Mr. Sumardi, sir! Tell this to the infidel American. Stop oppressing other countries. Tell him to build factories in his own country and not here! Nothing. Is it okay? Hello? Can I talk to Yanti? Yan, it's me. Dona. I'm fine. Yeah. Yan, can you do me a favor? Can you try to find this address? Don't worry. I'll pay you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Wishing you a long and happy marriage. So? Is your wife pregnant, yet? Well... No, not yet. Who's the successor of the boarding school, then? There's this beautiful student of mine. FOURTH WEDDING RECEPTION K H RIDWAN What are you doing? Film the stage. What? I told you I couldn't use this, right? We have tried and tried again. We've asked God to grant us a son. If He doesn't grant us one, we have to willingly accept it. We have to surrender. I don't understand why Kyai Ridwan had another marriage. Well, God doesn't forbid it. But as a woman, I sometimes wonder how his previous wives feel. I just don't understand Kyai Ridwan's way of thinking. He has a son who can inherit his boarding school. Why did he get married again? So, the film enters from here to here. It's called a sprocket. It moves the film on its path. You see these holes? They're called perforations. These perforations must be inside the sprocket. Otherwise, the film stops moving. And it will pile up here. If that happens, the film will be burnt. Incinerated. This money will last for a week. Here are the medical treatment details. ADMINISTRATION NITIPRAYAN NGESTIHARJO VILLAGE SEE YOU TOMORROW AT THE CEMETERY. WE'LL WATCH AN OUTDOOR MOVIE. DON'T GET CAUGHT, OKAY? Hey! What are you looking at? My friend has found your mom's address. How is she doing? She didn't say anything. She just said your mom works there for the time being. Allah Almighty speaks the truth. I'd like to inform you of something. Similarly to what I have explained earlier, to die as a shahid is very honorable. It's very noble. Any Muslim who sacrifices his life for Allah and dies defending His religion dies as a shahid. And Allah has promised them His heaven. Praise be to Allah. And if you are asked to sacrifice your life for Allah, who is willing to do that? MOTHER'S PRAYER What's wrong, Zak? Hey. What's wrong with you? Hey, Zak. What's going on? - Zak. - What happened? C'mon, tell us. Whose meal now? Hey, whose meal are you taking now? It's Zaki's. Please give it to him now. Do not eat it. Enough! That's enough! What's going on here? Guys, I'll leave for Jakarta this afternoon. Don't tell Romo Kyai. LEMPUYANGAN STATION PASAR SENEN STATION Dude, wake up. We're closed. - What time is it? - Why don't you go home? Come back here tomorrow. We're closed now. Wait a second, okay? Ms. Wulan will come down here shortly. You're Huda? When did she die? A year ago. I was her best friend. We were like sisters. - She never talked about me? - She often did. She talked about you all the time. But why did she leave me in the boarding school? She deliberately left you there. She didn't want you to be with him. If you had lived with her, you would have seen... and experienced how hard her life was. Your mom wanted you to be a good person. She wanted you to be devoutly religious. She never visited me. Why not? She might have been ashamed to see you. She felt she was laden with sin. She didn't feel it was decent to meet you. Your mom believed you would become a religious person if you lived in an Islamic boarding school. 31 JANUARY 1958 - 11 FEBRUARY 2000 MOTHER Do you understand what I mean, Rian? Rian. No. I just don't get it. It hasn't been a year since Dad passed. And you're getting married? Rian. Are you ready? Yes, sir. Have faith. I will. May Allah be with you. Peace be upon you. May Allah always protect us. My fellow Muslims, when you watch this video, if Allah wills, then I will be in heaven with Him. My fellow Muslims, we have to fight the infidel Americans and Jews. They have tricked us. They have tortured our fellow Muslims. Peace be upon you. May Allah protect us all. Wake up. Get up. It's time for the Shubuh prayer. Let's pray! Hey, get up! C'mon, wake up. Get up. It's time for the Shubuh prayer. Get up. C'mon, get up. Rian, is it your cabinet? Love or dreams, dreams or love Love or dreams, dreams or love - Hey. - Or love Where's the dangdut singer? Dona? She no longer lives here. - Where is she now? - She went to Jakarta yesterday afternoon. Somebody picked her up. I'm not going back to Surabaya. I'll come with you instead. Have you thought it over? I just want to go with you guys. May I? CERTIFICATE OF SALE Excuse us. Allah Almighty speaks the truth. Dad? Allah will join us together in heaven. May Allah grant us strength. Dad. Goodbye. The nurse told me there was someone who met her... and said that he would pay for all of my medical treatment. Who was that person, Dad? I have no idea. She said that person knows us. Why did you change your mind? Where's your faith? I just want to withdraw myself from this. Don't you want to enter heaven? It's not that. I'm not ready. All right then. There are many people who would happily take your place. I'm so disappointed in you. Why don't we ask for that Handycam back? Forget it. It's impossible. Romo Kyai will never give it back. Unless Huda asks for it. Huda is his favorite student. But never mind. When we graduate, Romo Kyai will eventually return it. Huda, where have you been? I hardly see you. I'm here, Romo. In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Let's continue our discussion. This hadith implicitly reminds us that as Muslims, we need to respect one another. And not only that, but we also have to respect other than Muslims. We must not harm them. And we have to be able to keep religious harmony. When the Prophet Muhammad occupied Mecca, which had been occupied by the infidel Quraisy, he asked his followers, the Muslims, to honor and respect the infidel Quraisy. He said... any Muslims who harmed innocent infidel Quraisy people were similarly harming Muslims. You're under arrest! What's going on here? What's our crime? - What do you think? - Arrest them! One, two, three, four. Move forward. Put your hands up. - Move! - Stop! Don't move! Don't follow us! Stop it! Stop! Stop it. Let them take us. Just be patient. Don't move! Get in. - Kyai! - Dad! Kyai Wahab. It's obvious that all of you belong to a hardline Islam activist group. Is that true? Absolutely not. A FEW YEARS LATER 1 MUHARRAM 1425 H, FAROKAH 1 MUHARRAM 1425 H, MAKING A MOVIE Ladies and gentlemen, let's come and watch the show. Tonight, at the subdistrict square, we're going to see the performance of the best dangdut singer in the world. We're going to watch Dona Satelit's performance. She will be accompanied by the band Angkasa. Don't miss the show tonight after Isya at the subdistrict square. We're going to watch the performance of the most magnificent dangdut singer. We're going to see Dona Satelit's show. And she will be accompanied by a very famous band. "In the name of Allah." "The Most Gracious." "I ask You for forgiveness and well-being in this world and in the Hereafter." "The Most Merciful." Still waiting for new updates from the USA and also the negotiation result of Indonesia's debt reschedule. Now, let's move on to the next story. The second Bali bomb explosion is assumed to have been activated by the terrorists who activated the first Bali bomb explosion. Three bombs exploded, one in Kuta, and the other two in Jimbaran. It took at least 23 lives and 126 people were wounded. This attack was executed by at least 3 suicide bombers who used the same modus operandi as that used in the 2002 bombing. The remains of backpacks and human flesh were the evidence of a suicide bombing. There's also a chance that the backpacks were hidden in the restaurants before they were detonated. The number of victims is increasing. The police are still investigating the crime scene. FOR MY LONGTIME FRIENDS IN THE BOARDING SCHOOL
