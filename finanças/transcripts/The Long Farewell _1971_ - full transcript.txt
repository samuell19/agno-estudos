Odessa Film Studio The Long Farewell Water comes from the pool, and then it's transferred to the right sector. There's no watering in common sense, nourishment is a better word... Marvelous... without any soil... - Well, not exactly, we have sand... - Very, very interesting. - Have you seen our... - No, I haven't... Well, why, these are beautiful flowers... Did you know that every 10,000 liters of water contain... ...10 grams of sulfuric and boric acid, that's quite delicate... - Well, how did you call him? - Nothing. I told you already... You must call him Dad. - He is your Dad, after all. - Okay, I'll try. Did you "sir" him? Nah. Students girls did. - Girls? - Yes, two of them, one is Dad's student, the other isn't. They've already been on an expedition, and at the Caucasus... - Who cooked? - We did, by ourselves. - I can imagine that. - Well, the girls did, mostly. Miss, can I get that flower? - This one? - Yes, and that one, please. - They're the same. - Doesn't matter. Sereja, look what a flower! Be careful. Hold this please. Oh, come on. - Do you remember grandpa? - Yes. - How can you remember, you were so little. Your grandfather... ...he was... ...he was such... ...he was so funny. Always made everybody laugh, but never smiled himself. He used to... ...used to say: "Lucia!" Lucia is your grandmother, by the way. "When are we gonna marry our daughters off?" - he said, "And let them hurry up, I want some grandchildren, it's getting boring to be all by myself" "I'm a practical man", he said. Practical man... he said that in such a funny way... "If not a son, give me some grandsons at least", he would say, and Vera, she would draw herself up, and say: "Yes sir!" He was a military man, your grandfather. But I was sober-minded, I used to say, "No Dad, you need to get an education first". And he'd raise his eyebrows and say: "Getting a degree in that field? Didn't know you need to have one nowadays" "I must be getting old". - Are you sure it's the right way? - Here. Huh, you do remember it, better than me. Women are generally worse in finding their way on the ground. There's even a medical term for it, "topographical cretinism". - Did father teach you that? - Nope. - Wasn't him. - Very witty, in his manner. Grandpa always wore a uniform, but then the war broke out and everyone started wearing those. Well, not everyone really, but it didn't matter to me those who wore civilian clothes didn't count as men for me. Ah, if only he was alive, he would tell you so much more... - I read books. - No, that's different. No one could write stories the way grandpa told them. And hardly anyone will. Give me a hand. Here. - Let's be silent for a while. - I am silent. - Would you see me to the station? - Okay, I will. Wonderful! Remember, I want you to bury me here. - Okay. I will. - Sasha! Sasha, do you think this hat suits me? It certainly does. Looks good to me. I'm happy with everything, by the way. Nina Ivanovna has invited you so many times... I am going, Mother. - ... but you didn't want to. And why? - I am going, Mother. - I don't need that. - I am going. Only I won't stay for dinner. And why, may I ask? What kind of caprice is that? Alright, I'll stay. You should've washed your hands. We're meeting decent people in a decent house... And stop biting your nails, here, have a nail file. Fix your nails. Take this nail file, I'm telling you! Sasha! Sasha! I'm talking to you, wake up! Take a nail file, fix your nails. - Will you listen to me? - Never! - Hello, dear! - My sweet, we made it at last! I'm happy you finally came, it's so boring out here. - Jenya, meet Nikolay Vasilyevich. - It's Sergeyevich. - Nice to meet you. - Excuse me, please, Nikolay Sergeyevich is an old friend of my husband. He's here for the first time. - Not for the last, I hope. - Most certainly not. Jenya, keep him entertained please. And don't get bored yourself, of course. Anyway, make yourselves at home. It's not my home technically, but it could be mine just as well. I'll be the lady of the house today. You see, how deserted this place is? Nobody, almost nobody around. - Hey, I live here too. Nikolay Sergeyevich, please, enjoy your time. Jenya, Nikolai... make yourselves... Keep them busy. I will. - Know what? I'll go get the bow. - The bow? Where is Sasha? - Sasha! What are you doing there? - Thinking. - What? - I'm thinking! You know, I love mongrels. - I think they're the best kind of dogs. - This one is a Great Dane. No, it's a mongrel, I know that. Dogs become attached to a man at first sight and once and for all. And they like me. Look. Fetch! Do as you wish, you can ride to town if you want. So what? What do you want? Please meet... my son. - Hello. - Hello. I taught you to say your name clearly and say "Nice to meet you." Here comes the hunter. So that's the bow you were talking about. Can you shoot it? A machine gun - yes, but not a bow. - Perhaps the boy is a pro. - No, but my mother is. - Who, me? - Let's sit down. You see, I have no time for bowing, I only did that once or twice... But I do have a talent, you know, others usually miss at first, but I hit the target. Mother could be a champion in any kind of sport. Easily. Throwing, shot put, basketball... - Football. - Why are we sitting? Go say hello to Masha. Hi. I didn't recognize you. I entered the university, by the way. To study architecture. No, you've changed a lot too, but now you seem... Already? Thank you, sir. Help! - No, I don't. I start to forget how to speak english, because there's no one to talk to. Especially in my field of work. Why, you are doing fine. Accurate use of new terminology. Actually, I've known you for a long time. - Really? - Yes, I read your books every day. - You're kidding. - No, seriously, you're the best. It's just a matter of experience. I've been sitting at the same place, the same table for 15 years, I bet you're thinking that I'm... sort of... ...flighty, aren't you? Well, don't judge by the first impression. Why, no, 15 years at the same table, that's not flighty by any means. Look, the ground's still warm, you can walk barefoot. One certainly should, that's good for health. Leo Tolstoy walked barefoot and lived till ninety. By the way, I saw a foreigner, who was barefoot. - You did? - Yes. Believe it or not... ...he was walking just like that, barefoot, in ragged clothes. I watched him and I couldn't believe my eyes. I watched... There are things that I just can't, can't understand. Why are you laughing? No, I just like the way you say that "can't, can't". So I stand there and Sasha keeps pulling my sleeve, "Mom, it's impolite to stare like that, let him do what he wants". That's right. Why? And I say, it's not forbidden, so I'll stare all the time I want. That is right as well. I want to understand, that's all. What's that all about? Me too, I'd like to know what is it all about. For instance, us, looking for champignons that don't exist. Why, last year I collected them. Last year - perhaps, but now they're not here. Me, trying to persuade you to take off your shoes. What is that, huh? I think it's beautiful. Don't you think? They're looking for us. Let's go? Let's go. When they're calling for you, you gotta go. Sasha... Sasha. Say something to me. You're always so silent. Please, at least say something. No. He won't say a thing. He's so melancholic... He sits with such a sad look on his face, that I begin to feel sorry for him. Sasha! Sasha. Look at the dog. Sasha... Do you hear me? Can you hear me, Sasha? Look at the dog, please. No, not at me, at the dog. It's a very strange dog. Its left ear is shorter than its right. Do you agree? Sasha, you're so unobservant. You don't notice anything. That's surprising, especially at your age. Don't be angry with me! See, you're already offended. - I'm not angry. - No, you are. - I'm never angry with women. - Is that so? Interesting... You know what? Call me, when you're in the city. Come and see me, we'll be good friends. I won't call. It's possible that I won't be in the city at all. So you're leaving? That is unfortunate. Ah, that's for us! They're waiting. Let's go, Liutik! - Where did you learn all that? - Now, look. - The most important is... - Fingerstall. Ah, yes. Now, the most important is... ...this little thing. - It's called bow sight. - I see. We used a match on a previous bow, now it's a proper bow sight. Now pull it back, hand to your chin... Girls! Who... who... who... How... How... How did you get here? Who are you? Who are you? How did you get here?! Who let you take the equipment? - Vasya... - I'm senior here! That's right. And you'll stay that way. - You must handle it carefully. - We will. It's sporting equipment, after all. Yes, and we've been looking for you the whole day. That's foolish. I sleep at daytime. That's right, because you're night watchman. Come in 15 minutes, when the table is served. Here it goes. Sniper shot. Dinner! Dinner! Sasha, where are you? I'm here, Wilhelm Tell. Wanna shoot, Sasha? Is it scary to stay here all alone? Of course not, Nicolay Vasilyevich has a bow and a gun... ...and the nature around here. - And you know what, I like being alone. - Do you? I love nature, and in the mornings it's so quiet here, that you can hear every leaf whispering to you something very special. It's marvelous! ...he wanted to come, but I left him there on the islands... ...and he had just come from Africa... - waiting at the airport in Tanzania. - Why? Masha, can I say something? ...you were on a comfortable ship... ...I want to make a speech... - ...may I? - ...and we lived in a wooden house... I want to make a speech! - ... and we did live in a wooden house. - Don't be ridiculous, what house? He's an architect, and very talented, I should say. All his pupils entered university just like that. Nina Ivanovna, I'm ready to pay any amount of money. No, he does that for his own pleasure, not for money. - Did you hear that? - I changed my mind. And he says, he's changed his mind. What is that supposed to mean? And what did you make up your mind about then, huh? He's a saint, that's what I'll tell you. Others wouldn't bother to coach him even for the money! Do you know how much private lessons cost these days? - How much? - You can't even imagine! See, your mother is worried about you. Let's drink to her health. - No, I'm too young for that. - This summer i was looking to tutor... Private tutor? Did I ask you? Did I? What for? - I know better! - You do? I'm listening. A "B" in math is not a grade for a man who wants to get higher education! - And you say you've changed your mind! - We'll talk at home. Did you hear that? At home! Do you know how he talks at home? "Yes" and "No", "Yes" and "No." And "We'll see". What's there to see?! I'm your mother! I have a right to know what's on your mind! I'm sorry. I've even turned away from you. So, let's drink to our beautiful ladies. - To our ladies! - Cheers. Cheers. Well, ladies... Masha, I wish to you to build such a city, where everyone will live happily ever after. I hope to live up to that day, Masha. - Congratulations, Masha. - Thank you, thank you so much. Once again, all the best. I like you. And to parents, they did their best too! Cheers. Now it's your turn, brother. Enough of sitting behind your mother's back. Evgeniya Vasilyevna! Jenya! And your day will come! See how serious he is! By the way, why so gloomy? Sasha! It's water, Mother. - Petya! - Hi. - I'm looking for Pasha. - Me too, what a coincidence. You've changed a lot. - Let's go. - He's not at home. He'll be here soon, come wait inside. Don't stand there, come in! - He's not at home, so... - Come in, will you? Why are you sitting here? They say, you've left with the military. - Really? - For Sakhalin, or something. The military... I changed my mind. I'm working at the warehouse. For the time being. Why am I telling you this anyway? You're too small, you haven't even worked yet. Let go, it hurts! - I did work. - With your father? - With my father. - That doesn't count. It counts. And I thought it was nothing serious, just for fun. Are you mad at me? Don't be, better tell me how it was. Maybe I'll fall for that Stone Age romantics. Yep, Stone Age tools. Made them ourselves. - Then we made a dugout boat. - You went boating? We did. - Any cute guys around there? - No idea. What's with you? We're in a bad mood today. Get, get up, cover me! - What are you doing? - Hide me, quick! - The guy from committee... - What guy? From the public committee, he's looking for me. It's like we're in a spy movie. Agents on a mission... - Kartseva! - Sasha! Let me go. Sasha! - Let go. Hello. - Hello. - I heard you quit your job again. - So what? Well, one should set his priorities, work or no work... ... from the committee. - What's your problem? - Who are you anyway? - Leave him, Sasha. Disturbing people just like that. Maybe we're in love and you're bothering us. - In love, huh. - Yes, and you... can't know... Wait a second! And yet you come here, with no respect for privacy... That's simply rude! How's that? You, boy, sh... And now you "boy" me. Isn't that impolite? Maybe I'm talkative, maybe it's just the way I am. There's an "individual approach", right? Right. There's an individual, a personality, and you're the society. - Stop fooling around. - Oh yeah? I am an individual, and you're the society. And what is a "society"? Yeah, what is it? - Give me your hand. - What? Sasha, let's go. - Give me your hand. - Don't. What for? - Well, if you're afraid... - Here you go. Let's see... Line of life, line of death, that's not important... Ah, there it is, look. The line of society. And the line of individuality. Here they cross... ...and you and me, we stand on the crossroads. What do I see here? Seems like a female silhouette... Kartseva... Tatyana... Alas, no, not her. No Kartseva on your palm. And you know why? Because you don't care whether she will eat tomorrow or not. Meanwhile she left her fourth job. And I do care, for instance. Maybe because I'm paid for it, think what you want. No hard feelings, eh? Gotta go. - Bye, Kartseva. - Bye. So he goes instead of us? We can take a break? Evgeniya Vasilyevna, I repeat: if it were a matter of scientific or technical translation - I would gladly entrust this to your department. I see, I see. So we can take a break. You've invited a specialist from outside. Why "take a break"? It's a matter of experience, of etiquette. If we were talking about you alone... Personally, you have my sympathy, in case you forget something, you know how to turn it into a joke. I see, I see. So it's Nevedomsky. - How do you know? - I just do. - Who told you? - Nobody. Personally, you have my sympathy, in case you forget something, you know how to turn it into a joke. Yes, I understand. I see. Personally, you have my sympathy, in case you forget something... you know how to turn it into a joke. Oh yes, I see. I see. So it's Nevedomsky. We can take a break, right? - How do you know? - I just know. - Who told you? - Nobody. Evgeniya Vasilyevna, don't take offence. Personally, you have my sympathy, in appearance and... Do you like my dress? Made it myself. And by the way, you have never examined our professional skills, neither we did yours. Come any time you want. Evgeniya Vasilyevna! Evgeniya Vasilyevna! Let me put in a remark here, dear Pavel Konstantinovich. Don't be so gutless. We all used to study. If you need real interpreters, here they are! - Good morning! - Hello. - Auntie Jenya, do you remember... - I do. - Do you know... - Yes. "Auntie Jenya", "Auntie Jenya"... like a child. - Sit. - How did it go? One moment... Yes? Yes, that's me. There's a girl here, remember I told you about her? - Your niece? - Yes, I'll wait. Thank you. Look at her! Could at least put on stockings. - I did. - Leave her, she's a good girl. Yes, I'm here. So I tell him: - "To hell with your foreigners!" - That's right! The principle is what really matters. Then I say: "All right, why bother keeping such a big department of interpreters?" And he says, with a smile: "Female interpreters". How 'bout that? - Really, that is... - So he invited Nevedomsky. - Who is that? - Ah, nobody. A friend of his, always wandering around. Maybe you should've been more delicate. - What's to be delicate about... - No, I just wanted to ask how... Transistors - he doesn't even know what it is. He hardly speaks Russian. - ... we could do it easily. - Yes, the girl's alright. Yes, yes, accurate, polite... To Pokrovsky? Good. - Look at her, quitting her fourth job. - Auntie Jenya... Learn to speak, for God's sake, "Auntie Jenya, Auntie Jenya... " Asking for favors, it's "Auntie Jenya". Kissing on the street, you're all grown up. People see everything and then they tell me about it. He kissed me first, for your information. I don't know who was first and I don't want to, but bear in mind... "Bear in mind", "bear in mind"! As if I care about your Sasha. I don't really like him, and he's leaving soon anyway. - Leaving where? - To his father. Why do you stare at me? Leave me alone, I'll go do my hair if you wish. - Where is he now? - Probably at school. Form a line! Faster, faster! Get in formation! I'm telling you! Make it quick! Will you get in line? Remember to raise your leg as high as you can when you jump. Come on, once more. Ustinov! Come back! Come back right now! They're very, very smart. They open their mouths and watch the lamp on the ceiling. I bring the spoon, fast, and he closes it and laughs with his mouth shut. And my girl sleeps all night long, which is a big relief, in daytime she's usually quiet, she lies there and watches her little hands, then grabs her left hand with her right and drags it to her mouth, thinking it's a toy, and when the left hand tries to escape, she catches it again. Only you need to walk quietly, when she doesn't hear the footsteps, she's quiet, not crying or anything, she forgets about me, she's quite happy all by herself. I've had enough, one day I'm gonna leave. I need money. Everyone does. What do you need it for? Well... nothing really, just for somebody. Yeah, right, the whole school's talking about your "somebody". You leave for a month and suddenly everyone has secrets. I'll bring you the money, don't worry. Where are your manners, young man? You're being impolite. - Didn't school teach you anything? - Absolutely nothing. Hey, doggy! I'll leave for sure. Father says, come whenever you like, Do whatever you like, work, study... He turned out to be... - To be what? - My kind of guy. You know, we used to walk in the mornings, and you walk there, at the Caucasus, and the sky above is... blue... ...pink and red, and mountains are green. - And don't worry about the money. - Doesn't matter, I'll sell my sweater. That's a good idea too. Wanna change? Mine is all stretched. I can't come without sweater at all, she'll notice. You'll sell mine and I'll bring you more money. You're saving it for Tanya, right? - So it's your father's money? Does she know? What? - That you're leaving. - No. She's alright. She's quite clever. Only pretends too much. - Pretends to be silly? - No, not really. Look, can you do me a favor? I need you to call someone and say "Ustinov has left, he sends his compliments. " - Got that? - Yeah. - Answer, quick! - Aah, yeah, it's Pavel. Yes. Ustinov's left, he sends his best regards. Don't mention it. I'd rather keep it in secret. Yes. What? What? She's laughing. Geez... - Well? - Well what? What did she say? Well, she asked "Who's calling?" And I said "It's me". - Who "me"? - Pavel, Pavel! - Well what did she say?! - She said... - She asked "Who's calling?" - I said "It's Pavel". Okay, was she surprised? Surprised... Yeah, sure she was. She asked: "Who's calling?" And I said "It's Pavel". - And the she... - What? - And so I told her, that... - What, what? She asked me and I said: "Ustinov has left. He sends his regards. " And she said what? - Well, she... - What? Well, she said that... She started laughing and... I started laugh... no, I mean I hung up, no, she hung up and... - ... and then I hung up too. - I saw that, it looked pathetic. Absolutely ridiculous. - You're humiliating me. - You made me look stupid! In whose eyes? Hers? You're leaving anyway, aren't you? Could you please call Tonya? - Who is she? An accountant? - No, mail carrier. Tonya! Tonya Sergienko! Tonya! - Hello, dear. - Hello. - Not on maternity leave? - Not yet. - Must be difficult to walk. - On the contrary, it's healthy. I'm working part time, so it's not too tiring. - Tonya... - Don't worry, I'll tell you as soon... I know, I know. What if I'm not at home, and you put it in a mailbox... No, better leave it here, I'll drop by from time to time. - All right. - Tonya... Tonya and... what about "Till Called For"? - Evgeniya Vasilyevna, I can't... - I know, I know. - Could you take a look if... - No, it's strictly... He's on "U", just like me. Ustinov. - I can't. - Tonya, could you do that now? You know I can't do that. Tonya, Tonya... His last name is on "U", just like mine. Ustinov. - I can't, it's strictly forbidden. - Tonya, please. It's about my son, Tonya. You must understand. Only one word, was there or wasn't a letter from Novosibirsk. Alright? Only one word, was there or wasn't a letter from Novosibirsk. Only one, was there or wasn't. Alright? Is he going to marry, or something? If only it was marriage. Don't answer. I'll drop by, alright? - Put that away, please. - Tonya... What are you looking for? Hi. Hello. What do you need money for? Did you take it? What do you need money for? - I need it. - What for? I just need it. - Well, explain it to me. - I need it, that's all! Jesus... Never understood what's so fascinating about these pictures and sitting alone in the dark. You need a fur-cap and new boots! What else does a man need that could be bought with money? What? A ticket! - What ticket? - I don't know. I don't really know. - Where are you going? - To the theater. - What do you need money for? - I just need it. You can stop lying. - I didn't intend to. - That's a relief. - I need money for Pavlick. - Ah, for Pavlick! That's another story! For Pavlick! It all makes sense now! For Pavlick... You don't love me, that's what it all is about. Do you love me? Mother, stop it, please. "Mother", "Mother"... You always say that... "Mother"... You don't love your mother! That's the point... Help me. You don't love your mother. There's a car waiting outside. - Must be waiting for you. - What car? What car, no one is picking me up. It must be Nukolay Sergeyevich! Actually I liked him back then, in the country. Me too, but... that's nothing serious. I've got to tell you a secret, though. I do have admirers. - As many of them as I want. - Wow! You know I'm not a kind woman, who loses her head over someone. And yet the car is downstairs and... ...a man is sitting in it. - You don't believe me! - Why should I? Do you believe me when I say that money is for Pavlick? Jesus... Pavlick, some car, a man in it. Yes and somebody is keeping him waiting. Somebody is talking to her son instead of talking to a handsome man. You're such a wise cracker! The play is about to start, and a man is waiting, offended... Why is she all shining and smells of perfume? - French perfume! - And why did you use it? - A present from colleagues! - That solves it. Why, is french perfume allowed only for students? Is it? Mom, seriously, where is the money? It's a secret! Perfume from the colleagues! Perfume, fume, fume... Fuse... no. Perfume, fume flying over a few of... Once upon a time I knew a... Don't stare, don't stare, don't stare, don't dare, don't you dare... That's how it's going to be! All men will be wearing beards! My friend, it's the wrong way to go, Which one then, if you'd be so gentle to show! Once there lived... an old man and an old woman. On the shore of a blue sky. With no bread or water, They didn't eat or drink whatever you think... They flew and they sang, until they turned grey... and... they turned... grey. - You're quite a poet, my friend! - So what, my foe? One should know... And bring me your record book, 'Cause she doesn't bite. And she's certainly worth a look... worth... a... look... A bruise on your face, you've caused a disgrace, question mark in your place. No lies, no lies, no lies, lies are like flies, and your eyes, of that size... whoever implies... believing in lies... lying, implying... implying... flying... Birds, flying away... they're either storks or birds of prey... One is clean and white, the other is out of sight... ...I'm out of sight, out of reach... like a broken phone. - Who is calling? - Elephant. Elephant on the phone. A bit forward. Don't be mad, Nikolay Sergeyevich. - It's impossible to be mad at you. - Why? Come to think of it, it's true. Right, it's impossible. - If that's the impression you have... - Why, no... - No impression at all? That's fine too. - Why, I didn't... - ... mean that at all. - Where are we going? To the theater. - I think I've seen that play. - "Nightingale's Night"? - Yes, "Nightingale's Night". - Didn't know that. You know what, I'll watch it till the second act and go home, - That would be better. - We can forget the theater and... No, no, what for? Trouble at home? - Sasha is a good boy. - I didn't say otherwise. But you meant it. - Please. - I don't smoke. - I remember you did. - No, never! I'd like to take you somewhere... back of beyond, to the country. What? What country? What for? To calm down. And to regain a sense of humor and other feelings that help us live. Nikolay Sergeyevich, what kind of nonsense is that? I was speaking figuratively, I have no intention of doing that. And I have no sense of humor! Never had! And I don't understand it! When something's funny I laugh, but sense of humor is... That's it, we're late, all because of me. - Come on, Evgeniya Vasilyevna. - What's wrong? I have the money, I always pay. Paying for woman equals humiliating her! Alright, alright. I want nothing, I need nothing. Goodbye. Dear son! I don't quite understand why I should write to the post office. I don't think mother would open your letters, and we don't have any reason to keep it a secret, you think? What does your mother say? The expedition was... "Leave us alone". "I'm asking you" "If you don't" Novosibirsk calling! Who ordered Novosibirsk? Please proceed to the second booth! Novosibirsk, second booth! H.. Hi, Dad, it's me. Dad... Dad, I have only three minutes. I have no money. Dad, can you hear me? I bought only three minutes! I'm at the train station. Yes, Dad. No Dad, I haven't decided yet. Dad! Dad, I have only three minutes, no money left, can you hear me? Hello? Dad? Can't hear you! Hello? Dad! Dad, Yes, I hear. Look, I... I'm fine, Dad... Yes, everything's fine. No, I haven't decided yet. Dad, dad, can you hear me? I want to live with you, do you hear? I made up my mind, I want to live with you! What do you mean, "and Mother?" I've decided, I want to live with you! It doesn't matter, Dad... No, nothing happened, just some nonsense... ...I'll leave anyway, it doesn't matter where. I want to start a new life, to hell with all of it... Send it to me, please. Don't you understand? Madam... Madam... Can I bother you for a second? I left my glasses at home. If you're not in a hurry, could you write something down? I'll be very grateful. There's the paper, there's the pen. The envelope's already filled in. Dear Lucya and Gena, you are far away, building your beautiful city. And we are here, waiting for you, waking up every day with one thought and going to sleep with the same one. We're hoping to see, as soon as possible, you, our dearest our closest. You're young, you're cheerful and happy. And your life is cheerful and youthful. It is bright and happy. And seeing you, our loved ones, so young and healthy, brings joy to our hearts. And if we're sad, that's because of our age. Nothing unusual about that. Life is declining, health is not the same anymore, and it's not getting better. Dear Lucya and Gena! Come visit us soon! Let us look at you and rejoice at your youth. Come at least for a short while, and don't worry about any expenses. Dear Gena and Lucya! I forgot my glasses at home, so don't be surprised at my handwriting. It's not mine. One Madam was kind, amiable and patient enough to agree to write down my letter to you. And I'm deeply grateful to her for that. I'll write my signature by myself, without glasses. It's not difficult. Here you go. - Hello. - Hello. "What's so fascinating about pictures", "sitting in the dark"... - One o'clock, time to sleep. - One moment, I'm reading. One o'clock, time to sleep. You can sue me for disclosure of private correspondence. Must be a lot of colleges in Novosibirsk. - He must be lecturing in one of them. - He is. Why aren't you in bed? I need to get up early. - One o'clock. - One minute, I'll see to the end. Reading books, huh. So unhappy here. I'm fine. Running to his Daddy. Coming home late. He was also unhappy here. Everyone's unhappy, only I'm perfectly fine. He left you when you were this little. And now of course, love at first sight! For all the books... all the photos... Go. Go away. Go on, anywhere you wish. Are you leaving? Are you sure? Yes, I'm leaving. Yes, I'm sure. Thank you. Once... we were driving in a car. It was a cloudy, dull day. Many clouds, but it didn't rain. Very quiet, dull day. Everything around is grey. The poplars are grey, the road, the sky... And we... ...we stopped. At the cafe. Small house on the roadside. We came out of the car, and suddenly saw there, sitting on the poplar, a very, very bright red bird. Sitting there, impossibly bright and red. And I'm shouting: "Look, look! It's so red, look before she flies away!" So red, it's hard to believe! It was a parrot. He lived in the cafe. Nothing strange. It's just that someone forgot to close the cage and he flew out. He wasn't going to fly away anywhere. I wonder... ...I wonder if your father remembers it. Ask him. It was a long time ago, he must've forgotten. But ask him anyway, and write to me. I know you don't like writing letters. But ask him and write to me, in detail, I really want to know. I will. I will. Evgeniya Vasilyevna, Nevedomsky is busy. Yes? Wait a second. It's for you. Yes? Was there...? And? What seat? I mean number, odd or even? Of course, they gave you the upper berth. The suitcase is in the storeroom on the cupboard. Yes... on the cupboard. Don't mix it up, our suitcase is the green one, checkered. - Nevedomsky is busy. - No, you take the checkered one. Look, I got my ears pierced. Didn't hurt at all. Three minutes and done. - Are you going to the party? - We're working. - Nevedomsky is busy. - Yes, we know. Evgeniya Vasilyevna, look at this, please. Look, Which tense should I use? ...time to learn such simple things, my dear. How many times do I need... I didn't know, I've never seen anything like it. Congratulations. Congratulations. Please. Congratulations. We'd like to present this watch engraved with owner's name, to our oldest accountant, Elisaveta Andreyevna! - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. - Good evening. - Evening. - Have you seen Sasha? - No. - You sure? - Sure. - Well, how are you doing? - Fine. - Fine? - Yes, just fine. I don't understand, that's all. Where can he be? I'm running around, looking for him... - Hello, have you seen Sasha? - No. - Have you seen my Sasha? - No, we haven't. There you are. What a handsome young man. This is my son, Sasha! Alexander Ustinov, nice to meet you. - What? - Ustinov Alexander. Well, call me Vasya, just Vasya. He takes after you. People say, you gave up school? And would such a good boy give up school? Everyone does these things at his age. Sergei! Brings us ice cream! - Make it two! - Three! - Make no mistake and bring five. - Alright. ...what I am going to do. He's grown up now, isn't he? And quite independent. Smart. Yes, he's going to his father. We talked things over and made a decision. We must think about future. What else can I give him? A father is a father... Here we go. We're already late. What's taking them so long? You know, there'll be a wonderful show today. We've invited so many outstanding artists. Just brilliant. Sasha, take my hand! Don't push. Sasha, come here! Excuse me, these are our seats. It's reserved for the department. They've been reserved! - You can take mine. - No, these are our seats! Wait, everyone saw that we were sitting here and... There's an empty chair. You'll change places when the number is over. - That's unbelievable! - Mom. - Mom, let's go. - No, I'll stay on principle! Sit down for God's sake, there's an empty seat! - The whole department... - Mom, come on... - No, that's... - Sit here, please. You sit here and I'll stand. - Mom. - It's scandalous! You're ruining the show. It's an insult! - Everyone saw that we're sitting here. - Just wait till the end of the number. Jenya, calm down. Tell them Sasha, what kind of behavior is that! I'll stay! I'll stay on principle! They're reserved for the department! A far sail shimmers, white and lonely, Through the blue haze above the foam. What does it seek in foreign harbours? - Sit down, will you? (What has it left behind at home?) What does it seek in foreign harbours? What has it left behind at home? The billows romp, and the wind whistles. The rigging swings, and the tall mast creaks. Alas, it is not joy, he flees from, Nor is it happiness he seeks. Alas, it is not joy, he flees from, Nor is it happiness he seeks. Below, the seas like blue light flowing, Above, the sun's gold streams increase, But it is storm the rebel asks for, As though in storms were peace. But it is storm the rebel asks for, As though in storms were peace. I don't want to see that stupid show! I don't want to, they're getting on my nerves! - Mom... - I don't want to see it. - We need to go home, Sasha. - Mom, don't cry. - You haven't packed and... - Don't cry, please. Pack things up and... Just one minute. - One minute. - Mother, I'm not going anywhere! I'm not leaving, I'll stay with you! - Mom. - Silly, he feels sorry for me. You silly boy... I love you. What does it seek in foreign harbours? What has it left behind at home? The billows romp, and the wind whistles. The rigging swings, and the tall mast creaks. Alas, it is not joy, he flees from, Nor is it happiness he seeks. Alas, it is not joy, he flees from, Nor is it happiness he seeks. Below, the seas like blue light flowing, Above, the sun's gold streams increase, But it is storm the rebel asks for, As though in storms were peace. But it is storm the rebel asks for, As though in storms were peace. The End.
