Our master isn't in now, please come in the afternoon Wait a moment sparring with the students will serve the same purpose Among such a bunch of cowards... there's bound to be one who has guts, eh?

Now hold it, everyone Please stop I am Lei Ming This is my senior Cheung Da Lung Your name, sir? Oh, two more experts have arrived! I am none other than Diao-Erh so, it's Mr. Diao! Our school bears no grudge with you Why are you causing trouble? Rubbish I'm determined to topple your school Come on ifyou want to fight Lei Ming, he is so bent on causing trouble... what else is there to say? I'll spar with you in the absence of our teacher Wait Master... I know Diao-Erh, long time no see! Diao-Erh You were a trouble-maker here in those days ...and public outcry forced you out of town Presently, though you've learnt some skills You're still stuck to your old grievances and vices Teacher, you've always said Judo is powerful Let me try it for myself Da Lung, get back Good kung fu. Well, let me oblige him Alright My apologies We'll meet again Drop by anytime One month later I'll return with some Karate experts You wait and see Lei Ming, this is a beautiful place If we could come here everyday ...it'd be so nice! Well, ifyou'd like... I can come with you every sunday and... Or go fishing over there, okay? Every sunday? Not good enough All you care about is boxing What's the big deal? One can't eat it Listen, your dad has spent his life teaching it What you just said... wouldn't he be furious if he hears it? He knows how I feel about it, honestly still practicing martial arts at such an old age And the school... it always invites trouble I'm afraid someday there'll be REAL trouble siu Ling, there's nothing to be so afraid of sparring amongst martial artists ...is natural and inevitable Even when troublemakers do come... We've always successfully dealt with the situation That Diao-Erh, the other day... used Judo to injure a number ofstudents Although dad drove him away While going he said he'll return with Karate experts I dread thinking what will happen then Karate! Oh, this is not correct This technique requires speed and some power Do you follow? Yes Everybody stop Come here Everyone, please sit down Today I'd explain to you all... the objective oftraining in the Chinese martial arts It is the legacy from Chinese people... passed down from thousands of years ago All styles of Chinese martial arts... are broadly referred to as Kuo shu I wish your training here today ...will progress fruitfully And let Chinese martial arts spread widely Establishing the kung fu of the Chinese people And maintain it as a proud tradition This is the objective of learning Chinese martial arts What I have said to you... should always be in your hearts As for some youths who after learning kung fu ...become belligerent and bellicose They go against the objectives of learning kung fu As you are my students... I want you to remember: Unless faced with a crisis... never use your skills to hurt others One of our key objectives... is to train ourselves, ...and build our bodies; To enable us to contribute substantially to society Yes Now then... you may ask if there are any questions Go ahead Teacher, that man Diao who came the other day He kept threatening... to return with Karate experts What in fact is Karate? Well, Karate also originally developed from our... Chinese martial arts many years ago ...in the Tang dynasty. The Chinese palm and fist techniques, after having been brought to Japan... underwent refinement for over a thousand years ...and eventually became Karate Also known as Tang sau ('Tang Boxing style') ...Karate can bring out untapped human potential; such as power from hands and feet... and escalate it to the maximum within split second It is therefore a hard-style kung fu ...and very aggressive when attacking Its power can also break wooden boards and stones Master According to you, if Karate is so powerful... are there other techniques that can defeat it? Yes The lron Palm and Light Leaping Technique ...when combined can certainly defeat it Any more questions? If not, the class is over fortoday Lei Ming, everyone is gone What are you thinking of? Just now you heard our teacher mention ...Karate as being so deadly If that Diao fellow some day really... brought Karate experts; What should we do then? Oh, don't mind him With teacher here, what have we to fear? Wages have been paid at the mines today Let's go to Master's house for a few drinks. Come Master, here... a toast to you Oh no, I'm too old for this You should drink with Lei Ming Right, I'll abide by what teacher says so Lei Ming, you have to drink now? If Brother Da Lung raises a toast, can I refuse? It matters little if I'm drunk But ifyou're drunk... you might have to crawl back Come on, drink Brother Da Lung, drink less You drink so much every day Who'll want to marry a drunkard? You both aren't married and yet keen to side with him When you marry him one day ...dare I come and drink here? You're flippant and always tease me siu Ling, don't feel shy Da Lung is hardly a stranger here When little Ming's parents passed away... he was handed overto me to care for I have seen you both grow up as pair Around new year's time I'll pick an auspicious date ...for you both to get married so I can put this matter to rest Oh, teacher's going to be a father-in-law! Don'tjust stare, raise a toast to teacher Come on Master, I raise a toast to you Let's all have a drink Good Let's play our drinking game Eight horses, seven skillful... guess? Cheers Once again Good... Teacher, I'll see him home Okay No need, I'll... Brother Da Lung, go safely Please, gentlemen, upstairs Welcome This way please Please take a seat Come, sit What would you like to order? These are honoured guests from Japan Bring us your best cuisine and wine If we're not satisfied... we'll tear down your restaurant Come on, get going Yes... Kita That old codger goes to the school in the afternoon Let's eat and rest, and then go there What do you think? Though there are a number of chaps in the dojo They are useless I believe these two ofyour men here ...can beat them The old man however, does have some skills You must be careful, Kita Good kung fu, excellent! Kita We must win this time, can't accept defeat Winning means fame and fortune Losing means the end of everything What are the benefits ofwinning? In the event that we overthrow the institution We'll be famous But what's the use of fame? Have I trained diligently in Okinawa for 20 years ...just to become famous in this petty place? With fame We can establish our own dojo here And open a casino as well You'll train fighters, I'll run the gambling joint Would we be short of money then? As an old Chinese saying ofyours goes specify terms first, courtesy later'; Let's be clear When that time comes, how do we split the money? Brother, don't worry As long as the mission is successful We'll go fifty-fifty, everyone gets equal share What do you say to that? Right, we have a deal then Yes, a deal Here, let me raise you a toast Yes, go fast Ah suen What's up? Ah suen, I was looking for Master Lee Lucky to have met you on the way What is it? There were these customers who came into the restaurant Looking like vampires I overheard them saying Perhaps they'll come to your school & cause trouble The manager has asked me to warn Master Lee How many are there? Four in all Three ofthem appear to be Japanese Let's not botherthe teacher yet I'll go and check it out with you sure Have a seat That fellow over there is from the school Hey, it must be fate We meet again today Little bastard... what, the cat got your tongue? Well then, kneel and bow three times to me And I'll spare you Otherwise... Diao, watch your mouth The worst is I'll lose my life fighting you What more can you do to me? Right, I'll let you taste the power of Karate And then fix yourteacher If you mean those 3... weird looking creatures Let's go and meet teacher right now ifyou've guts Come on, quick. Let's get out of here Tanaka Yep! Good, let's start from the beginning Be quiet, all ofyou. Lui Ming, Da Lung Go and get those two here Yes No need to chase, I did it Diao-Erh, you have a ruthless heart My pupils have neither wronged you nor bear a grudge Yet you cruelly resorted to such violent treachery Ruthlessness makes a great man, not pity That fellow insulted us And insulted the Japanese masters Take it up with them ifyou dare since it has happened... There is nothing to be said Don't think just because this is a way-side place... there is no law, and you can do as you please Who did it? step ahead My man did it Let your students seek vengeance first I'll save you for the last An eye for an eye; every debt its debtor! since that's the case...

They say that after Mr. Lin had won in the casino ...he was falsely accused of using a loaded dice so they locked him up Mrs. Lin went to make a plea for him at Diao's But was raped by him so she killed herself What about Mr. Lin? When he saw his wife dead, he also killed himself! Lei Ming, what is it? I was thinking Ever since those ruffians came to this place ...there hasn't been a day without trouble First it was the school; our teacher was killed Then there's the casino And they lend money at high interests ...thus ruining many people's lives Now two more lives are lost There'll come a day... when I'll wipe out these villains But... their kung fu is so powerful What do you have to fight against them? According to you, if Karate is so powerful... are there other techniques that can defeat it?
