Hey, honey, I forgot to ask you. Can I get John's number? I want to make sure he can make it to the wedding. Are you in your office? I'll find John's number myself. Ooh. You have one new voicemail. Mom, mom, it's me. Okay, I was right. He is after our money, okay? Just don't say anything to him. I'll be home soon. I think he might be dangerous. Okay. Oh, my god. No, no, no, no, no! Jessica was right. Ah! Look at this. Twenty-five percent. Guess I'm pretty good at the serving game. If you say so yourself. How'd you do on your table of six? - Ten percent. - What was that? Ten percent. I stink at this. It's okay. It could be worse. You could have some random guy you don't even know moving into your house tomorrow. He and your mom are in love, Jess. What'd you expect? A head's-up would be nice. Aww, poor thing. Easy on the PDA. Back to work. Sorry. You're gonna get me in trouble. Isn't that Paul at the back table? - How could you do this to me? - Keep your voice down. I didn't even see him come in. - Where's my money? - I said keep your voice down. I can't tell. Are they arguing? - Rick, back to work. - Oh! You owe me 20 grand, and I should shut up about it? We're done. Let go of me. I swear to god, if I ever see you again, you're gonna wish you never came looking for me. Hey, what's going on? I'm sorry. I just... I saw my mom's boyfriend arguing with some woman back here. You saw Paul? Hmm. Hey, how is your mom doing? We haven't had a girls' night in forever. She's great, shacking up with her boyfriend, living in sin, as they say. He's moving in? Good for her. A little odd for you? First time your mom's gotten serious with a man since the divorce? No. It's odd 'cause I don't even know the guy. I mean, you hung out with them. Anything you can tell me? Well, it was only a few times after they first met. But my impression? He totally loves her. So as odd as it may seem, your mom has needs too. - Eww! - Oh, stop it! News flash, young lady. Women over 40 are still getting it in and having sex. Now back to work. Mom? Hey, Jess, do you want something to eat? I'm making breakfast. Hey, what's with the face? Him. You mean Paul? Yeah. I mean the guy that moved in here after dating, what, six months? Come on, babe. It's not like we don't have the room. Come on. What's the big deal? Maybe because we don't know anything about him. Well, I know, I know enough about him to know that... He treats me like gold. I am really happy when I'm with him, and I know he feels the same way about me. Look, honey, we're gonna have plenty of time to get to know him while he's here, and he's gonna get to know us too because that's how it works. And you'll be going back to start grad school at the end of the summer. Nobody's perfect, babe. We're not. You know, I didn't know a lot about your father when I met him, and then I found out there were things I didn't really like. I was barely 20 when we had you. Come on. Yeah, well, you didn't even try to make it work. You know what he did. Maybe if you were a better wife, paid him more attention and didn't always argue with him, maybe he wouldn't have cheated. Eww. That sounds like something your father would have said. Okay, you know, it is a few lousy bags, Jessica. He has most of his stuff in storage. I don't understand. Yeah, clearly. Is that Rick? So? So you can have a boyfriend, but I can't? Is that how it works around here? I don't know how it works around here, mom. All right, babe, let me tell you how it works then. I'm your mom, and I love you so much, and I work really, really hard to keep things going here, to keep this roof over our head, and so when it comes to things like my life, my happiness, my Mr. Right, I'm gonna make those decisions. I'd like your support. You didn't even answer my question. What do we know about this guy? Well, ladies, I have officially moved in to your house and your home. Uh... Is everything okay in here? I don't know, Paul. Is everything okay here? Don't even start. What do you mean by that? I saw you yesterday at Joe's, arguing with that woman. What? What, are you spying on me? No. I'm working at Joe's this summer. You didn't know that, did you? No, kiddo, I-I sure didn't. Uh, god, uh... Look, the woman she's talking about is Carla Russo. She's a client. That was a business lunch. I'm sure I've told you about her. Oh, Carla Russo. Yeah, yeah, he told me about that. A client? I saw her pushing you, dude. That was a playful shove. We just negotiated a really tough deal, okay? That's all you saw. A playful shove? Mom, you're not gonna ask him any questions? No, no, I think I should, actually. Paul, was it a playful shove? - Yes. - Yes! Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. So tell me the truth, babe, 'cause this is all new to me. Did I do something wrong? No, you did nothing wrong. Jessica just needs to get used to all of this. She misses her dad. And I never, not in a million years, would try to take his place. But even if she doesn't see that, look, I... I am committed to what we're building. Okay? I am all in. We're gonna spend our lives together. And since your daughter is a part of that, I'm gonna make this work, I promise. I know you will. Oh, my gosh. What time is it? Oh, god. I'm gonna be late for this appointment. If they wanna have the best real estate lawyer in the state, maybe they could wait a few minutes. Not with what I charge. Are you sure I didn't move in too soon? Not for me. I gotta go get dressed. I love you. I love you. - Bye. - Love you. Love you more! Shoot. - Jesus! - I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. Is there something I can do for you? Ah, look, kiddo, I was just talking to your mom. And you're right. You're totally right, okay? We don't know very much about each other, all right? But I want that to change. We're family now. Yeah, if you say so. I gotta get to work. Excuse me. I know you don't like the guy, but give him half a chance. - Why should I? - For your mom's sake, for one. You saw him arguing with some woman. Why are you still bumping about this? He claimed she was a client. There you go. Any chance you're just a little rattled that he's invading your territory? Mom said that too. Look, if you're really concerned about this, why don't you just look through Paul's things when he's not home? You're telling me to snoop? Kids go through their parents' junk all the time. If you're still barking up his tree, I'm pretty sure he would thank you for doing it. You think that's all I'm up to, huh? I only met him once. Average forty-something, nice, a bit dull. Sorry. I just don't see anything there. Hi, Jessica. You all right? You seem a little down. Not gonna find you snooping in the kitchen again, am I? No. Promise. You're still upset about Paul moving in, huh? Look, I'm finally gonna have drinks with your mom tonight. Now, I'll talk to her about the Paul situation. You know, girlfriend-to-girlfriend. That'd be great. Thanks. You're welcome. - Can you do me a favor? - Anything. Next time I don't go with my gut feeling, just punch me in it, please? First of all, no. And second, what are you talking about? I don't think I shouldn't even be here right now. I mean, I'm about to go to grad school. I should be in Austin, hanging out with my friends, but no! - So why did you come back? - My mom. - She ask you to? - No, she didn't have to. I just felt guilty for not being here for the past four years, so I thought I should be with her. You're a good daughter. Yeah, well, if I knew she was shacking up with some guy she barely met... Just don't get me started. I mean, I know I'm an adult now, but why do I have to be the parent too? She shouldn't even trust this guy. She's just so in love, she doesn't even see straight, which I guess is a good thing I'm here, right? Don't hear me complaining, do you? No. - Come in. - Hey, bud. Feel like catching a movie with the old man? Can't, dad. I'm meeting up with Jessica. Ah, it's Jessica again, is it? Yeah, so what? Nothing. You know I always liked her. I was actually glad to hear you guys were hanging out again. Uh, anything serious? Hate to disappoint you, dad, but she's not gonna be in town much longer. She's just saving money for grad school. New wheels, decent apartment, you get it. Doesn't answer the question. You got a lot of them today, huh? Well, you know, you guys aren't kids anymore. Rick, you never know when you might meet your Ms. Right. I knew it the second I met your mother. I know, dad, but right now Jess is dealing with her mom. What's wrong with Tracy? She's dating this new guy that Jessica is super suspicious about and completely obsessed with. The last thing she's thinking about is her future with me. Well, you never know. A lot can happen in a short amount of time. Tell her I said hi, okay? Okay, dad, you got it, okay? All right, buddy. Jess, I can't believe I actually had fun playing a sport! I'm gonna have your mom try out for the wnba. Hey, no sports balls in the house. Sports balls? Sports balls. It's a rule. Okay. Okay, um, I'm gonna go take a shower, then I'm meeting Sandra Gettler for a glass of wine. I cannot remember the last time we did this. Okay, have fun. Oh, my god. Dinner. Babe, I'm so sorry. No. Look, I'll cook dinner. Don't worry. - You'll cook dinner? - Yeah, I can cook. Because you're amazing. Is he not the best? Oh, my god. Thank you! Salud! Oh, I missed you. I missed you too. How long has it been since we've done this? - Oh, my god. Months? - Months. And that is all my fault. I've been M.I.A. Since I started seeing Paul. Oh, it's okay. You're in love. I'm happy for you, girlfriend. Thank you. So, um... Jessica mentioned to me that Paul has started living with you guys. She mentioned or complained? No, I know that this is a lot for her. I get it. But lucky for us, Paul is absolutely wonderful. I know you guys have been dating for a while, but do you think moving him in is just a little bit too quick? You have been talking to Jessica. She's worried about you. - I understand your concern. - Mm-hmm. But I am acutely aware of not knowing everything about someone, even when you're living with them. Good. Her father cheated on me for so long, and he used to make me feel crazy for even being suspicious, until one night, I found all the texts. Did I ever tell you that he used to go by a different name with each of the women? No! Are you serious? Yeah. What kind of psycho does that? Good riddance. Who is this? "Michael O'Neill." What? Okay, so I'm freaking out right now. Why? What happened? You know how you told me if I was worried, I should go through his things? Yeah, Jess. That was like this morning. Yeah, well, I went through his office and found a wooden box, and you are never gonna believe what I saw inside. - What? - An old driver's license. So what? Did he have like a mustache or something? What's the big deal? No, his name is Michael O'Neill. - Wait, what? - Yeah. I took a picture of it, and I'm gonna send it to you, along with some photos I found, okay? Okay. Did you get it? Okay, it's strange, but there's gotta be a logical explanation for this. Like what? How like Adam Miller's real name isn't Tom Lewis. That's Adam's fake ID that he used to buy beer. Paul is definitely... Paul is definitely old enough to buy some damn beer. I don't know, Jess. I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. Oh, I'm jumping, all right. I knew this guy was a bad guy. I'm definitely gonna tell mom about this, right? I'd be careful if I were you, okay? You really don't know what's going on here. That's the point. Paul is... Oh, hi. I didn't see you there. I'm sorry. I keep doing that. Um, dinner is ready, and your mom texted me. She's gonna be home any minute. Okay. I'll be right down. Crap! Was that him? - Yeah. - How much did he hear? I don't know. Wow. Okay, this was absolutely amazing. Glad you liked it. I loved it. It was so good. Wasn't it great, babe? Yeah, mom, it's great. Good job, Paul. Jess? Jessica. Hi. So I talked to Sandra. She said that you guys have been speaking a lot at work about me and Paul. Oh. Really? What... What's that about? Nothing. Come on. What's, um... What's on your mind? Okay. Um, do you know what time it is? Do you know what time it is? It's get to know Paul Riley time. I thought that's what time it was. It is get to know Paul Riley time. Ask me anything you want, okay? Anything at all. Yes, please. Just get it off your chest. Are you close with your parents? Well, sadly, both of them have passed, but I was close with my mom when she was still around. I really wish I could have met her. Yeah. She would have loved you. In fact, you remind me of her quite a bit. - Really? - Were you ever married before? Yes, briefly. Did you know that? Yes, I knew that. I did. And her name was, um, Shannon. Shannon. Shannon Cassidy, yeah. So... anything else? - What else? - I am an open book. Whatever you want to know. Okay, since it's get to know Paul Riley time... Is your name really Paul Riley? - Oh, my god. - Because according to this, it's, uh... Oh! Michael O'Neill. Honey, what is that? I found his old driver's license. Oh, and this. Isn't that Shannon? You went through Paul's things? Well, according to this thing, his name isn't Paul. So what's the story, Paul? Or should I say Michael? Yeah, what... What's going on? Well, it's actually a very sad story about a mentally unstable woman who made my life a living hell. Yes, I remember you telling me that Shannon was not well. But I didn't tell you everything. Shannon and I were together for almost three years. First two years were, well, they were fantastic. You know, until it wasn't. It changed. She changed. Turns out that she was taking some pretty heavy-duty anti-depressants. She suddenly decided that she didn't need to take anymore. First, she was possessive and then threatening... And then she got violent. It was actually so bad that I was worried that she was gonna hurt me while I was sleeping. So then why didn't you call the cops? Because half of her family was on the force. I didn't know what to do, you know? I knew that if I called, I wasn't going to get any help. And if she did do something to me, then who knows how far they would go to protect her? So I... I made a really difficult decision, and I ran. I just ran. I got my stuff, and I moved, and I ran to a new town and a fresh start. But she found me, tracked me down in a couple weeks, and I had to do it all over again. But that's when I decided that I should change my name legally. - So it's legal. - Yeah. Of course it is. And then I met your mother, um, six months later, and I really, I haven't thought about it much again. You know, I'm not invested in my past. I... I want to make this family work. I'm really sorry that you had to go through all of that. It sounds terrible. If it was so terrible, why did you keep all this stuff? Because, even though I go by a different name now, right? That person in that photo, that's still me. Just, you know, living a life that turned out a little differently than I expected. That's still a chapter in my life. I guess I felt that I wanted to keep something from it. But I don't want you to think that I live in the past, okay? You guys don't have to worry about me, you know? I'm like a shark. And why don't we have to worry about a shark? Because a shark is the only fish that cannot swim backwards. Forward is the only direction that they go. - Oh. - That's what I want. I want us all to just move forward. Like a family of sharks. But... I'm really sorry. I should have told you. I understand and thank you for sharing. I know that wasn't easy. You know what I am taking away from all of this? Is that we would all do very good respecting each other a lot more in this house. That's what you took away from all this? Yes. And if Paul went through your things, I would say the same thing to him. Do you understand? You're kidding. If there's anything that you want to know, just ask me. I mean, his story, it's ridiculous right? I don't know, Jess. People go psycho on each other all the time. There's like a thousand TV shows that stream that very subject. He's lying. How can you know that? I just know, okay? Okay, okay. Says he wants us to be one big happy family. Sounds like he's trying. Oh, yeah, he's trying something, all right. I just don't know what it is yet. At first, I thought he was after our money, but mom says he's some big-shot financial consultant, family inheritance or something, but... I don't know. Do you think he could be dangerous? Yeah, I do. Then call the cops. See what they have to say about it. Cops? What are you two still doing here? Hey, Sandra. Hey, Sandra. Keep going. Well, I know you talked to my mom last night, but there's been an update to the whole Paul situation. Oh? What's the update? His name's not Paul. - What? - I found his old ID. His name is Michael. And he never told you? Nope. Wow. That's, uh... Easily explained away, apparently. So he did have an explanation, and your mother totally believes him. A hundred percent. But you don't. Look, I know if my mother had met a guy that had a whole other identity, that would definitely raise a red flag to me. Thank you. But you have to trust the adult here. Your mother can make her own decisions. She's not a fool. No, she's just in love. Jessica, I know this can be difficult, but you just gotta give this a little bit more time to work itself out, okay? All right, I'm taking off. You guys, lock up, please. And no cops. It'll only make things worse. If he gets spooked, he'll just run. She's right, Jess. And the best part of the meal, dessert! Yay! Should I use this to cut the cake or cut the tension in here? Are you kidding me? You're gonna need a bigger knife to cut the tension. Babe, can you give us a minute in here? Yes. - Okay. - Yes. Look. Kiddo, I get it, okay? I get it that you are bothered by the fact that I used to go by a different name, all right? I mean, hell, it'd bother me too. It would. But the last thing I want is for something that's in my past to be an issue in your present. So just tell me. Tell me what I can do to make this right, whatever it is, and I'll do it. I don't know. I guess I'm still a little freaked out. Yeah, sure. One skeleton. I have one skeleton in my closet. And you know, I'm so glad that it's out in the open. I'm actually... I'm relieved, honestly. But I meant what I said yesterday, Jessica. I mean, we're gonna be a family soon. And I want you to feel comfortable being able to talk to me about anything. You know, whether it's your future or Rick. And hey, I'm a guy. Maybe I have some, you know, good boy advice. I mean, if you want, we can even talk about your father. No, I don't want to talk about that. Okay, just know you can. I hope that you know how much I love your mother. So no more looking through my things, okay? No more questioning my motives, all right? That has to stop now. But if there's ever anything at all on your mind, right, you can come to me, okay? We'll work it out together, okay? Deal? Uh... deal. Shannon... The next thing I know, my mom's running off into the kitchen, and he's acting all fatherly towards me. Oh, that reminds me. I sent a message to my father's friend last night. - Why? - Hal's a private investigator. Thought he could do some digging on Paul or Michael or whoever the hell this guy is. Aw, you did that for me? Do you think he can actually help us? He's my godfather, so I hope so. Wait, I didn't think you believed me. I never said that, Jess. But even if I didn't, I would do anything to help you. So think of anything Paul said to you that might be important. Like what? Does he have like a brother or sister? Ooh, good. I'll just ask him if he has any siblings. So what are you doing later? Hanging out with you, duh. Wanna pick me up after lunch? I'll be there. Morning. Hey, good morning, kiddo. How'd you sleep? Mm, not bad. It was a good talk last night. Yeah, it was. You know, actually, I did think of another question to ask. Shoot. Well, you mentioned about your parents, but you never said if you had any siblings. Come on, Jessica. What? You're saying that you didn't just hear me? No. 'Cause I was just on the phone with my only brother, John. Oh, what a coincidence. Where does he live? In Manhattan. He's in town for some business. He just wanted to, you know, touch base. Wait, wait, did you say that John was in town? Yeah, yeah, he is. Why didn't you invite him over? Yeah, why didn't you? I mean, I was gonna. I thought about it, but you know, I mean, to be honest, it's been a little stressful around here, and I didn't want to impose on you guys. Okay, first of all, it is your brother, and I insist that you call him and tell him to come over. - You got it? - Yeah, I'd love to meet him. - It'll be fun. It'll be nice. - Yeah, it'll be great. I can make lunch. Oh, my god. What am I gonna make? Maybe I can make something here. All right, I'll try him back right now. He did say he had a really busy day, so... Yeah, totally. It's ringing. Hmm. Voicemail. Figures. Hmm. Hey, listen, John, it's your brother. Look, I don't know why I didn't ask you earlier, but why don't you come by before you leave town, you know? It'd be great to see you in person, and of course you could meet Jessica and Tracy. So I will text you the address, and hopefully you can make it. All right, bro, bye. - It's probably too late. - Yeah. Oh, my gosh, I really hope he can make it. How great would that be? It would be really great. You're coming around. I gotta figure out lunch. Oh! Coming! Rick, I said after lunch, okay? Hi, I'm John. You must be Jessica. Uh, hi. I've heard so much about you. And your mom, too, of course. Is my brother home? Oh, yeah, of course. Come in. - Beautiful home. - Hey! There he is! - Paulie! - Oh, my god! I'm so glad you could make it. Oh, my god. I wouldn't miss it. How long has it been? A couple years, right? Look at you. You look so good! You look good. Must've been the result of this one taking such great care of you. Hi, John! - Tracy, John. - It's so nice meeting you. I'm sorry it just took so long. Hey, you're here now. That's all that matters. You guys have already met. This is Jessica. This is my brother John. I'm surprised you're actually here. - In the flesh. - Yes, yes. And I am making lunch in the kitchen. - If you will follow me, sir. - Okay, I'm taking her away. Go. Oh, god. This is so... I didn't think he was gonna make it. Me either. Let's eat! So how's Manhattan? Oh, New York's New York. It's loud, proud, crowded, and I love every minute of it. You gotta be kidding me. Look, I'm sorry, guys. I gotta make a quick call, okay? I'll be right back. Oh, Paul, you're fine. Take your time. We're good. This is actually perfect timing. I want to talk to you guys alone for a little bit. Let me guess. You heard that we found out about his past life. I'm not talking spiritually. All right, Jessica, stop. Seriously, you're being so rude. No, it's okay. The last thing he wants to do is upset you more than he already has. No, I appreciate it, but... Look, John, I told you I don't want you to get involved in this. I'm sorry. I had to. Look, I knew you back when you were Michael, and I was there to witness in person why you had to give up the family name. - John... - Okay, really... Okay, is there anything else I can do to let me show you my brother's a good guy? I am fine. Well, actually, as a matter of fact, can I see your ID? She can see it. It's fine. You don't have to show her anything. Here you go. It's so unnecessary. Can we just enjoy our meal? - That sounds like a great idea. - Yeah, okay. And you know what? After this, let's go burn off some calories playing basketball. - You in? - Yes! Hey, it's my ball, my shot. - Whoo! - Ohh! Show him how it's done, baby! - That's it! - There it is! Come on! Show him what you got! "John O'Neill." Guess I am crazy. Come on, old man! Hey, dad, what's wrong? Just seeing what you're up to. Why would anything be wrong? Guess I'm used to getting distress calls. I'm on my way up to Jessica's right now. Okay, I was just wondering what time you'd be home. Uh, dad, I gotta go. Okay, I'll call you back. Good job. Come on, old man, let's go! Yes! Oh, my god. You're just in time. - Get me out of here. - I got you. Did you ever hear from your dad's p.I. Friend? Where do you think we're going right now? - Are you serious? - Said he'd hear us out. Thank god, you know, I'm not alone. You never were, Jess. Touchdown! Hey! Hi, Rick! Hi, babe. - Where you going? - Just keep going. Rick, you wanna play a little two-on-two? We're good. Really? Come on. Couple of old guys. Show us how it's done. - Why not? - All right. All right, shirts versus skins? You guys be skins. I'm kidding. We'll be skins. Whoo-hoo! - Give me this. I'm retired. - Okay, babe. Let's go. Check the ball. Whoo! Yeah! Ohh! Hold on, hold on. Pick him up. Pick him up. Ohh! Yeah! Tie score. Guys rule. Not like that. That's how it's done! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Let me get this. Time to remember the day. See you guys later. - Good job, babe. - Let's go. That was sweet to take a picture, Jess. Good job, guys. All right, so... This is all you have on this fella? That's all I know. So what do you think? What do I think? Well... I think I'm hearing a ton of suspicion on your end, which I can understand why. Really? Maybe I'm not crazy after all. But you are severely lacking in the evidence department, young lady. That's why we came to you, Hal. Can you look into it, please? Well, I suppose I can shake a few trees for my godson, but if I find anything inappropriate, I'm gonna tell your father. Fair enough. Email me the pictures you took inside that box. I will. And the brother you met today... Is he still around? Yeah, as far as I know. Maybe I can get some more information out of him while he's still here. I mean, there's gotta be more. Standing by. Good to see you again. Baby brother. Oh, yeah. Before I forget. Oh. I'd have reminded you. There's a little extra in there, you know, for the obvious reasons. I gotta admit I was a tad nervous, showing up in person for this one. Yeah. Never needed you before, but you did great. You did great. Thanks. Oh, good call on getting that ID last-minute. How'd you know the kid was gonna ask? Because she is a pain in my ass. She almost busted me on a little side hustle that boomeranged on me a couple days ago. Little bitch. She's not even gonna be around that much longer. I had no idea how much of a problem she was gonna be. I even set up a fake social media page for you. I know she'll do a search. Hmm. Yeah, she's got some balls. Yeah, that's what got me worried. I mean, a little less worried after your little dog and pony show. Oh, well, that's it. This area has dried up for me. I'm gonna have to find another place. Probably move south. So how many days you need me to stick around? I told 'em you'd be crashing with us for a couple days. Don't worry. You're gonna get paid for your time. Yeah, we need to talk about that. Yeah? What? Well, it seems our little arrangement here has shifted a bit. How so? Why don't we just yank off the band-aid? Pretending to be your brother in the privacy of my own living room, that's one thing, one price. But turning up in person, sincerely pleading your case, well, that makes me an actor, don't it? And that, my friend, is an entirely different price. So you guys good here? We were. So let's get back to the matter at hand, shall we? I think we're venturing into partner territory. No one asked you. Well, nevertheless, I think we can agree that we're past a few bucks stuffed in an envelope. I'm gonna need a stake in this going forward. What if... What if I don't wanna go forward? Well, then I'll find a different way to get my money. Look, I'm gonna hit the head. We probably should get back to your family. But while I'm gone, think about what your woman would say if she knew I was as much your brother as I am the king of England. Actually, forget her. What if the girl knew? Hey, babe. What's that? Well, John is gonna stay with us for a couple of days, unless, of course, you'd like to check his credit score or something. Sorry. You feeling better about Paul? I don't know. I guess. Babe, you were there. You heard everything John said. You mean the only guy that we met that knew Paul before all of this has said that he's telling the truth about the thing that he lied about? Wow, mom, what a ringing endorsement. Jessica, you ID'd him like an angry bouncer at a bar, and he showed you his ID. I don't understand. What is this all about? Besides the fact that your boyfriend has a fake name? Jessica, you didn't like him before we knew all of this. - Why? - I don't know, mom. Maybe because you didn't ask me if it was okay for him to move in. Why didn't you ask? Um, first of all, I had no idea that you were gonna act like this. You're going to be back at college pretty soon. I'm moving on with my life. I'm in love. I thought you'd be happy for me. You're right. I should have talked to you about it. I was just thinking about myself. I'm... I'm sorry. At least I know what this is about now and why you don't like Paul. I just don't know how you can trust so wholeheartedly. Baby, you can't go through your whole life not trusting people. Like you trusted dad? Not fair. I'm sorry, mom, okay? I just... I don't want to see you get hurt again. - Oh, hey. - Hey. I was thinking I might've overplayed my hand a little bit in there. Yeah, you know, just a... Just a bit. Well, I'm sure we can work something out. Listen, I'm not worried about it, not at all. All right, let me get back into character for you. Yeah, you are a character. You sure you're not mad at me? How could I be mad at my baby brother, huh? Oh, god. Morning. Where's your brother? John? He took a red-eye home late last night. He was dying to get out of here. I thought he was supposed to be staying with us for a few days. That was a plan, but frankly, he... He didn't feel comfortable being here. - Oh. - I mean, can you blame him? I mean, you challenged him in the same way that you've been challenging me again and again. I mean, really? Did you really expect him to feel comfortable being here? Or me, for that matter? Thanks a lot, kiddo. I just don't believe it, not a word. Okay, now, exactly why do you think that Paul would lie about his brother going home early? 'Cause he was supposed to stay with us for a few days, and then suddenly he's on a plane back home out of nowhere? Nowhere? You said you carded him at lunch. Well, okay, but everything was fine after that. We had lunch, played basketball. Why would he suddenly get his feelings crushed hours later? Okay, so what do you think happened? And you better not tell me that you think that Paul hurt his own brother. I don't know. Maybe. I just think maybe that guy was pretending to be his brother. Jessica, do you realize how crazy that sounds? Look, I've said it once, and I'm going to say it again. Let your mother handle this. I can't. She's in love. Mm-hmm. No. This is such a great idea. Yeah. With everything that's going on, I just figured we could use some alone time. And you were very, very right. Do you think we should order something to go for Jessica and bring it home for her? You're so sweet. You're always thinking about her, even though... Yeah, I am, a little more now than ever, even if she's not, you know, like my biggest fan. You know what? Jessica has always been hardheaded. Always. She gets that from her dad. Honey, I think she's gonna come around, hopefully while she's still in the house. Yeah, hopefully. Me too. Is that your friend Angela over there by the bar? Oh, uh... I don't think... I don't... Kinda looks like her. You know, I guess I must have made a mistake. I definitely made a mistake... For not asking you to be my wife sooner. Is that what I think it is? Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! Yes, I will marry you! Oh, god, I love you. I love you. Listen, you know... That I would never ever, ever... Do to you what Mark did. I only want you. Just you. Just... us. I believe you. I don't know if that's even true. - Hey! - Hey, hey! What's with the giddy grins? Oh, nothing. So dinner was just that good? Dinner was excellent. Oh, my god. You're gonna say, "oh, my god," when you see this thing. It's beautiful, it's beautiful. Champagne? Look, I'm not holding my breath, but both of us would really like your support on this, okay? Well, when's the wedding? That's the best part. One, two, three. - Next week! - Next week! Next week? What's the rush? - You're not... - No! Look, we just figured we're so in love, why wait? Yes, why wait? I could think of a few reasons. Yeah, I bet you could, kiddo, but that's why I didn't ask for your permission first. Babe, I know that this is a lot for you to take in right now. Given everything that's happened. But we are willing to let that all go if you are. Yes, let's let it go. God. Unbelievable. Hey! Jessica! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Don't worry about it. No, it's not okay. Jessica! Jessica, stop! Stop! Okay, what are we gonna do here, huh? Real talk, okay? Because I can't take this anymore. I understand you're upset about what you've found with Paul, but you need to let that go now. You need to let it go, all right? Because this is happening. Why can't you just wait a little while? Because I don't want to wait. Because I don't want to put my life on hold any longer. Hey, don't you want me to be happy? Like really? You haven't seen me happy in so long. I have done everything that I could to make you happy. Your dad is happy. Why not me? - Mom... - No, I'm serious. I'm serious. Why does your... Why does your dad get so much slack? I-I don't understand. He left us in the middle of the night. He kissed you on the forehead while you were sleeping and took off. Please. This is so hard for me, and I know it's hard for you, too, but, baby, everything I have done has been for us. This is no different. I love you. I love you so much. And so does Paul. Good morning. - No, not a good morning. - Why? What happened? They're getting married, like in a freaking week. - Wow, that was fast. - Yeah, you think? So what are you gonna do now? I don't know. - What's the matter? - Damn it! Sorry. Jesus, dad, you're like a stage-five creeper. Nothing's the matter, all right? Doesn't seem like nothing to me. - Okay. Don't get mad at me. - Tell me. I'm sure you'll be the very first to know. I've been talking to Hal lately. Go on. - It's about Paul. - Who's Paul? You know how I said Jess is like super crazy suspicious about her mom's new boyfriend? I'm starting to think she's not that crazy after all. Hal's a private eye. I know, I know, but he's the only guy that I trust that could check in on this guy. You know, for someone who you don't expect to be in your life much longer, you certainly are neck-deep involved in hers. You like her. I knew it. Well, I'm sure Tracy has been feeling lonely since the divorce. I know how hard-hit I was when your mother died. Takes time to make that connection with someone again. You know, the older we get, we get set in our ways. It's not easy. Well, I hope you guys aren't invading this woman's love life for no good reason. Same, believe me. Well, look, you guys be careful, okay? I trust Hal, too, but I expect you to tell me if anything turns out rotten on this guy, okay? You got it. All right. - Hello. - Hello, Hal? Hey, this is Jessica, Rick's friend. - He told me to give you a call. - I did. First of all, anything happen since we last spoke? Well, the brother disappeared. Paul said he went home, even though he was supposed to stay with us a couple days. - Mm-hmm. - Did you find anything? Well, I couldn't find out anything on either of the names you gave me for the guy, but I did find out something about the woman in the pictures. Oh? You said her name was Shannon Cassidy, right? - Yeah, that's right. - Her name's not Shannon. It's Scarlett. Scarlett Shaw. Another name, another lie. Another name, another lie. I was able to track down her address. It's not too far from you. I'll text it right over, okay? Oh, perfect. You're a lifesaver, Hal, thank you. Yeah. Here's the thing. I feel like I should go with you. Oh, no, no. I'll be okay, really. Fine, but you need to tell your mother about this right now. I will. I promise. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Bye. So you're just gonna drive over there? Yeah, why not? It's only like 90 minutes away. Well, shouldn't you call her first? I did, but no one answered. I just think this needs to be done face-to-face. Well, I want to go with you. Hal wanted to go, too, but I really think that more than one person coming at her is just gonna freak her out. Babe, I appreciate that you want to go. I really do. I just... I need to do this on my own, okay? I just think this guy could really do some harm. No way, Jess. I started this thing with you, and there's no way I'm not gonna be there at the end. Hey, babe, I gotta go, okay? I'll call you after. Where's my phone? Oh, there it is. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Hello. Uh, is this Hal? Yeah. You need help with something? Yeah, when you say "help," you mean... I'm a private investigator. It can mean a lot of things, pal. Well, um, my name is Paul Riley. - Oh. - Yeah. You've been talking to my stepdaughter, Jessica. Yeah, um, I have. Look, she came to me, pal, because... Because she doesn't trust you, okay? So you really need to be having this conversation with her. Are you with me? Well, I have. I will again, believe me. What exactly have you told her? What have I been telling her? That the women in the photos she found... Shannon, whatever... Yeah, that's not her real name either. It's Scarlett Shaw. Hard to tell what you're playing at, buddy, but it doesn't sound kosher to me. You gotta hear my side of the story, Hal. I mean, this whole thing's gonna blow up. I don't think that's such a great idea, Paul. Look, let me buy you a beer, all right? I'll buy you a beer, and I will tell you the whole story. Maybe you can help me smooth this thing out. Yeah? Why can't you just tell me over the phone? So you're investigating an underage girl's guardian, and you don't think I deserve the respect of an in-person meeting? Where? There's a bar. Danny's. Opens early. I'll text you the address. Meet me there in an hour. I know Danny's. Great. Son of a bitch. Hey, Paul, is that you? Yeah. Can you come here for a sec? We're in the gazebo. Okay. She's a little distracted. You think? Yeah. Oh, my god. You have no idea. Is she on her phone all the time? No, she's not on her phone. She's trying to make them coins. - Really? - Yeah. She is making tips. Honey, hey! You remember Sandra, right? Yeah, of course. Hi. Hey, Paul, how you doing? I'm fine, yeah. Everything good here? Oh, yeah. We're just having a little girl talk. Where are you off to? I just gotta go take a little bit of work. Okay, well, I don't want to keep you. I will see you back here later, okay? - Okay. - I have a surprise for you. Ooh, the surprises never stop in this house, do they? Bye, Paul. Oh, my god. I didn't tell you. Oh, my god! I didn't even notice. Wow, it's beautiful! Congratulations! Thank you. So when's the wedding? Here's the best part. We're getting married next week. Wow, that... next... That's fast. And that's judgmental. And why do you care how quick it is? You're not the one getting married. Tracy, can we talk? Yes. Are you sure the whole name-change thing, it's really nothing? Oh, my... of course I am. Of course I'm sure. I am so mad that she even said anything about that. - Tracy, come on. - No! Sandra, I'm having a hard enough time as it is with Jessica. I do not need my best friend trying to make me suspicious of my fiancé. Why can't you just be supportive of me? Just 'cause you haven't found a man, you're gonna... Wait! Wait! Now I'm gonna stop you right there. Now, I didn't trip when you stopped calling me because you found a man, and I talked your daughter through this mess and gave her a job at the same damn time. But that right there, no, ma'am, I will not... I am so sorry. I don't even know why I said that. I am not your enemy, Tracy. I'm just trying to help you guys. I know you are. I know. But, Sandra, I promise you, I promise. I do trust him. Paul would never hurt anybody. Hey, babe, what's up? Hey, mom. Okay, look, don't freak out. Oh, god, Jessica, what did you do now? I had a friend of Rick's look into what we know about Paul. He's a P.I. Jessica! He's lying to us, mom! Babe, I cannot handle this! Her name is not Shannon. Okay, babe, it's enough, it's enough. I can't do this anymore, okay? And why did you tell Sandra about Paul's name change? Because I needed to talk to an actual adult who didn't make me feel sorry for finding out the stuff that I found out about him. - I want you to come home now. - No, but... Now! Oh, my god. I can't do that. Excuse me. Uh, can I help you? Uh, yeah. Are you Scarlett Shaw? Who are you? I'm sorry. I'm Jessica Johnson. Do you have a minute to talk? I don't know you, Jessica Johnson. Yeah, I know you don't know me. - What do you want? - It's about Michael O'Neill. Would you like some tea? So when I first met Michael, it was one of those magic moments that you only see in the movies. Romance or horror? Well, it started off as the first. He moved in right away, and we got married after only a few months. No prenup. You know, he was so sweet to me, I never even actually considered it. Michael got himself pretty drunk one night, and he told me some things that I think were the actual truth, like his dad died when he was a kid, and he was raised by a single mother, and she was really abusive. Oh. I didn't know that. His mom always had plenty of money, but she never even bothered to raise her own son. I mean, she never even bothered to feed him. I mean, amid all that luxury, he just kinda had to fend for himself. Can you imagine what that must have felt like to an eight-year-old boy? No. So one day I needed his bank info for something, and he wasn't home, so I went through all of his stuff. That wasn't what I found. A box like what I found? Two of them... Of him with women whom I'd never met. Oh, my god. And then I looked a little further in his computer, and I saw marriage certificates. He had married both of these women under different names, so I had to look more, of course. Glutton for punishment. And I saw their bank account information. He had completely cleaned these women out. I knew it was about the money. Hey, future husband, are you back? Paul? Hey, babe. Hi. What is this? Look, trace, with everything that's been going down lately, I just, you know, I felt like... I needed to do something to show you how serious I am about us. What? Babe, I know how serious you are. Yeah, but look, it's just a little more real when you put it down on paper. And this is notarized already. What is it? Yeah, I had a buddy of mine do me a favor, so that I could, you know, surprise you with this now. This... This officially merges our lives. Our money, property, everything. I want you to know that even before we say our vows, everything that's mine... Is yours and Jessica's. You're amazing. I love this. I love you. You are wonderful. I love this. Should we, uh, make it official? So what'd you do? I confronted him. And he came up with all of these excuses, and, oh, he was so sincere. I really just didn't want to hear it. Did you go to the police? No. Why not? Steve. Who's Steve? My ex. He never really trusted Michael, so he decided to delve into his past. Then what happened? He was killed... In a carjacking gone wrong. So the more I learned the truth, the more I began to realize that it was probably a murder gone right. And all of a sudden, I was terrified of this man that I was so in love with, and I just wanted him gone. So then what did you do? I paid him off. Hmm! And... It was 200 grand. Once he'd gotten what he came for, he went away. And I consider myself lucky. Just imagine if I had dug a little deeper what he might have done to me. Look, I know this guy frightens you, but him and my mom are getting married next week, and I know the police won't believe me, so maybe you can just... No. I've already told you everything I know. Please, just... I'm sorry. I-I just... I just can't. Okay, okay. Hey, it's okay. You've told me more than enough, okay? I'll just tell my mom everything that you just told me, and hopefully it's not too late, okay? Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm so sorry. - Come on, pick up. - Leave a voicemail. Hey, mom, it's me. Okay, I just saw the woman that Paul used to be married to. I was right. He is after our money, okay? Just don't say anything to him. I'll be home soon. I think he might be dangerous. Okay. Hey, honey I forgot to ask you. Can I get John's number? I want to make sure he can make it to the wedding. Paul? Paul! Hey, where are you? Paul? Paul, are you in your office? Are you in here? I'll find John's number myself. Okay, that's weird. Forgot I had this thing on silent. You have one new voicemail. Mom, mom, it's me. Okay, I just saw the woman that Paul used to be married to. And I was right. He is after our money, okay? Just don't say anything to him. I'll be home soon. I think he might be dangerous. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no, no! Jessica was right. Jessica was right. Leave a message. Hey, Sandra, it's Jessica. I think we are in real trouble with Paul, and I need you to get over to our house and bring your little friend. Get... over... here... now. Uh-oh. - What? - I don't know. I think it has something to do with Paul. Jess wants me to come right now. - I'll come with you. - No, it's fine. I got this. Okay. Mom, mom? Mom. Mom? Mom, no! Okay, nap time's over, ladies. Wake up! Wakey, wakey. Come on. There you are. Hi. Hi. Yeah. Ohh... You just couldn't let it go, could ya, kiddo? No. All right, I'm gonna take off your gags now, but if either one of you screams for help, well, then we're gonna be wrapping this up a lot sooner than I planned. All right? Yes? Huh? Just nod your head. Okay, good. How about you? Yeah? Wonderful. There you go. You're pathetic. Look, while the two of you sit there looking at me with total hatred, just remember that all this was avoidable. - How, by robbing us blind? - Well, no. Actually, that part was gonna happen anyway. What I'm talking about is this unnecessary extra step of having to clean up this goddamn mess. What do you mean, clean up? What do you think I mean, trace? 911? I think someone's breaking into a house. I think he has a gun. Please hurry. Please, Paul. Paul, please. Please let my daughter go. - Oh, your daughter? - Let my daughter... If your daughter had let this go, then none of us would be here right now, would we? No! I'd be long gone. The two of you would be... Penniless. Actually, I was gonna say "safe." But you know what? You're right, you're right. Two things can be true at the same time. Are you proud of yourself? I don't know, are you? Are you proud of yourself? Because two people are dead because of your actions. Who? Your brother, huh? That's one. Who else? Uh, let's just say that there's one less private investigator in this town, poking his nose in where it doesn't belong. Oh, my god. Hal? Oh, god, I told you, kiddo. If you wanted to know something, you should have just asked me, kiddo. Babe... I'm really sorry. I know how much you were looking forward to the wedding. God, and you really fought for us too. Wow. I didn't plan on your daughter going all Nancy drew on us, but, you know, luckily, there's more than one way to skin a cat. What's that? Oh, this? This is nothing. Just a legally binding document that your mother signed today that merges our money. You don't think the cops will be suspicious of that? The fact that she signed it, and we both turn up dead the same day? Well, I mean, according to this, she signed this weeks ago. But you are right. The whole avoiding suspicion part, yeah, that actually is gonna be a little painful for me. What do you mean? Oh, yeah. Bad news, ladies. All three of us will be the victims of a horrible, horrible crime. A home invasion, more specifically. Very soon, an extremely brazen thief with a gun is gonna come through that back door. The police will know things will go horribly wrong, and he's gonna shoot both of you dead. And how would they know that? Well, 'cause I'm gonna tell 'em, and they're gonna believe me because he shot me for dead. But, spoiler alert, I don't die. Guess I'm gonna have to bite the bullet on this one. Maybe just take one in the arm. - How could you do this to us? - Oh, come on! Please. Stop being such a drama queen, trace. It's just business. No, it's not. Just some sick, twisted revenge for the way your mother treated you, isn't it? What did you just say? I spoke to your ex-wife. Scarlett. She told me about you and your past. Must have been hard having a mother who treated the family dog better, huh? You don't know anything about that. Well, then tell us, Paul. You're an open book, remember? Must've been hard to be living like a peasant, while your mom was living it up, huh? Enough! You know what? It's been a fun game, ladies. No. I'm afraid time's up. No, no, no, no. Babe, are you okay? - Babe! - Are you both okay? You okay? Surprises never stop in this house. Oh, my god! - You okay, mom? - Yes, yes. You okay? I am so sorry. - I am so sorry. - Guys? Oh, god. Where'd he go? Girl, looks like you picked the wrong Mr. Right. Oh! Score! Almost forgot to tell you, Ms. Johnson. My dad knows a really great guy at the office that he'd love to introduce you to, if you'd like. Up to you. No, no, I'm not ready. But tell your dad thanks. Jess? Jess! He's not coming back. How do you know? Because he's a shark. Go on. Yeah, go for it! Okay! Thanks for coming. I don't like meeting guys alone for the first one. Same. There are a lot of lunatics out there. Tell me about it. I've been dating nothing but losers for years. I met this one online. Hope he's different. Yeah. Oh. I think that's him. Yep. Here he comes. Sarah? - Hi. - It's nice to meet you. I'm Brian. How y'all doing? I'm Sarah. You know that.
