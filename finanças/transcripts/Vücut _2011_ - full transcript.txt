I don'! want lo. I don't want to. It's most unsuitable behavior tor a gilt. Beating up her classmates like that. You're right, sir. I don't know what to say. But it's really not like her. Did they provoke her somehow? Your daughters a bit heavyset. She's chubbier than her friends. They might have teased her. You know what it's like to be leased at that age. She can't help it. She lakes after me. May I suggest the girl be put on a diet, for health reasons. And anyway, what makes her so aggressive? She grew up without a father I was two months pregnant with ilknur when her father passed away. Not that I knew at the time. Anyway, it's taken its toll on her. I see. But the other parents are involved now. I'd like you to speak to her. Ilknur has been suspended for a week. If there's anyone else in the family who n speak to her have them do so. We can't tolerate students who use physical force against their classmates Do you understand? Yes, sir. Thank you. I'll talk to her. I'll do what I can Good day. You've disgraced us both What kind of gin does that? Where did I go wrong? So you're a little overweight? Be grateful you haven'! got any real problems. When I think of all I endured to raise you. First I put up with your father, now you God, why have I been cursed? I'm never going to school again. And I'm not leaving home. What are you doing? What's got into YOU? Nothing. I was watching that. So, you screwed up at school. Don'! worry about it. Things happen. Get off! What did I do now? Why are you so touchy? You're bothering me. What are you trying to do? Who do you think you are? I'm just trying to talk to you Don't. I just want to be left alone. I don'! need anyone. What's the big deal? All this over a few kilos? You can lose it. You're so stuck-up! What's that all about? You're lucky to have a big brother like me. Shame on you! What's this? I told you not to get all bundled up. Take it off. Take it off Don't. Let me leave this on. Shh. Take it off. Please. I don't want to. Leave it on then. Ah! Come here. Get on top of me. That's it. Sit on me. Lela. I know you're in there. Open the door. Lela. Open the door and let's talk. What? How are you?

Get out of my way, Izzet What's going on down there? What's wrong? I can't manage anything I can't do anything right. I can't. I like burnt eggs. If you'd stop taking those pills. It's not that easy. They take you to another world Is it obvious? Can you tell? I need them. How else n I bear it? You've got me. I wish I could get a new body. I feel all bruised and rotten I wish I could be reborn. What are you doing, ilknur? I said, what are you doing? You don't leave the house. You make trouble at school. Then you wander around the house like this. Are you out of your mind? What are you trying to do? - Take those things off. - What are you doing? Stay out of it. You come once a week and think you're in charge. Go to your room. Leave her alone. How can you talk to me like that? Is it my fault? What if she goes out like this? Come on. Don't overdo it. She's just bored. She beats up her classmates. Then this. Are you going to handle her'? You're as shiftless as ever. Enough! That's enough! You're smothering us too! You're killing me, gin. You haven'! changed a bit. You do what you gotta do. Why don't you come visit me, Candan? Oh God. Don't ask I was wondering about something. That plastic surgeon of yours. You said he was great. He's in Etiler, right? Have you got his number? Meltem. Meltem. Hey, I'm calling you - What's up? - This is up. Yilmaz, is it the time for this? It's always the time. Come here. Come here. When are we going to move? I want to live in a new ?at.

Ah, that's enough already. I wish I took after dad. My brother did. Then I wouldn?t be like this. Doesn?t my past bother you? No. Why non? Because it's in the past You're so cool about everything. Sometimes I think you're faking it. But I'm not. What makes you like this? I don't know. I don't care about things like that. I had this lump in my chest. Then I met you that day. Really? Yes. You're good-looking. The gins must be after you. Yeah. Most of them like me. You're not modest, are you? There's nothing to brag about. People talk like about me like a stick of furniture. Like I haven't got a soul. I n imagine. Never mind. Is it possible to escape the past? I look in the mirror every day. Slop looking then. - Hi, I have an appointment. - What's your name? Leyla Uyan.
