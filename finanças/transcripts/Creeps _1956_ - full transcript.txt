[♪♪♪] STOOGES: Good night, children. Now, be good little boys and go right to sleep. Not till you tell us a bed time story. Okay, okay. Once upon a time, there was a lion. Was it a big lion, Daddy? Yeah, was 50 feet from tail to head, 50 feet from head to tail, 100 feet altogether. It was a dandy lion. Oh, no. Silly. Tell us about brave knights, Uncle Moe. No knights. Tell us a scary one about ghosts. No knights and no ghosts. Tell us one with a lot of killings and a lot of murders in it so we can sleep real good. I want knights. No knights, ghosts. Oh, oh. Killings and murders I want. [BOTH GRUNTING] Knights. Ghosts. [BABIES SHOUTING] Quiet! Quiet! All right. We'll tell you one with knights, ghosts and murders. BABIES: Goody, goody, goody. Once upon a time, your daddies and I were in the trucking and moving business. Well, one night we were sent to a spooky old castle to pick up some antiques. It was raining cats and dogs. And the wind was howling. [STOOGES HOWLING] [LAUGHING] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [WIND GUSTING] So this is Smorgasbord Castle. Light some candles. Shemp, come on. I'm coming. This joint gives me the creeps. Uh-oh. MOE: Hey, Shemp, come on. All right, I-- How do you like that? It's stuck. Quit stalling. Hold your horses. What are you stalling about? You know we got one night to move. I can't help it, my umbrella won't close. You're just a dumbbell. Give it to me. I'll close it. [SHEMP LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] Cut out the clowning. We got work to do. The sooner as we get out of this spooky joint the better I'll like it. [DOOR SCREECHES] [SNORTING] Wh-What was that? Why that was-- Wait, that was the creaky door. Hello, everybody, this is Desmond of the outer sanctorum. Strange things will happen in this mysterious castle. [CACKLES] Who could get along without nights' bloody murder, hm? Yes, there will be strange happenings. [CACKLES] [SCREAMS] [THUDDING] Oh. Oh. What happen? Strange happenings. That's strange. Come on. [GRUNTING] [THUNDER RUMBLES] I hate this castle. People said it was haunted. Ah, go on. There's no such thing as haunted houses and spooks. That was just a coincidence. Who this belongs to? [WIND GUSTS] [SCREAMS] What happen? Just a coincidence. Fellas, let's get started. Well, see... Thank you. Why are you thanking me for? I wasn't thanking you for anything. Then what with you thanking me? I didn't say a word. But I did. Why didn't you say so when I first asked you? I didn't say anything. One of us is nuts and it can't be you. Right. [LAUGHS] Keep your big mouth shut. Just a minute. People have a right to talk, you know. Oh, a wise guy, eh? [GRUNTS] Let him alone. Now, listen. We gotta get busy. You, help me getting the table over the truck. You, take the armor. Come on.
