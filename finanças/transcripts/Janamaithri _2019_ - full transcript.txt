Hello! - Vijay Babu Chetta! This is Midhun. Tell me. - Where are you? At the office. What are you up to? Nothing. The post production of 'June' is going on. Okay. I've called to tell you something. - Tell me. There's a friend of mine. John Manthrickal. Have you met him? The one who wrote 'Annmaria'? - Yes. He was with me to write 'Annmaria'. He has a story with him. Will you listen to it? What's the genre? It's humour. Like our 'Aadu'. Like 'Aadu'? But it's not on such a huge canvas. It's a small movie. Ask him to call me. I'll listen to it. - So I'll give him your number. He'll call you. - Okay. Doing great, right? - Of course. Hello Chetta. This is John Manthrickal. Yes. Midhun told me. Tell me, John. When can we meet, Chetta? Where are you now? - I'm at Kadavanthra. Can you come to my office at 5 PM? - Yes. See you then. Bye. Chetta, I'm John. - Please come, John. Sit down. Tell me. What's the subject? This is a humour subject. It's not a hero-heroine oriented subject. There are 5-8 characters in the story. They drive the story forward. The story begins in Kochi and ends in Kannur. Shall we read it? - Okay. Okay. Start. It's good! But will everyone connect to it? It's an experiment, Chetta. Who will do Samyukthan's character? Saiju Kurup was the one who came to my mind while writing it. I've narrated the story to him. Why don't you ask him? Saiju can do it. It's correct for Saiju. What about that policeman? I didn't write the policeman with anyone in mind. You can think about it and decide. Shall I tell you a casting for it then? - Tell me, Chetta. What if Sabumon does it? He has great comic timing. I had given him a commitment during the Bigg Boss finals too. When I heard the script, I thought he could do it well. I've also felt that he has good timing. We can think about it, right? - Of course. That SI's character is really important. Who's in yur mind for that? How will Indrans Chettan be? That would be a variety. Indrans Chettan will be awesome. Fixed. - Okay. Chetta, one more thing. The other casting? The corporate? - Yes. You should do it. Me? Stop it, man! - It will work only if someone who has an executive look does it. No! It won't work if I do it. - No. It will work. That's fixed. Let's try it out, right? - Definitely. So the main technicians are all from 'Aadu'? So you can decide everthing else with Vinu. Vinu handles everything in production. So, your first film would be under Friday Film House Experiments. Well, you didn't tell me the title. Chetta, the title is 'Janamaithri'. (Public Friendly) Shall we start then? Father, this is our presentation. I'll show you in detail. I've seen enough. What is this, man? Father, this is a demo of how a CCTV network will function in a college. What I saw now? You can stream these visuals 24X7 on your mobile, Father. What did you think? The students here are wayward or what? This college runs on discipline and obedience. No... - No? Not that, Father. I mean... This is a demo video selected specially by our marketing team, for the college campuses now. If you're not interested, we can avoid cameras at the area where couples usually sit. Area where couples sit? Exactly, Father. - There's no such area here. This is not such a college. Father, you don't know! These couples sit across the cafe, outside the college. If you agree... If I agree? We can capture all of it. What happened, sir? If you make me stand outside for every meeting, how will I learn? When you're standing idle here, did you check how many CCTV cameras can be installed here, and where all they can be installed? No. - No. This is why I always make you stand outside. Understood now? First learn to execute what I told you correctly. Sorry sir. How many papers are you printing, Samyukthan? Don't you know that Sunoj sir will scold us if you waste paper & ink unnecessarily? Samyukthan... - Sir. Did you sell our CCTV to a customer called John Joseph, saying that its HD quality? Oops, sir. Not HD. HQ. High Quality! You must get our company shut down! - Never, sir. Do one thing. Call all the staff members. Sir... It's a sales review meeting, right? So, isn't it better if only the both of us are here? Samyukthan, this is a sales review meeting. And it's not dating, for just the both of us to be here. That's why... Go and call them! Do you know what this is? Egyptian Pyramid. Tell me, Abhimanyu. It's correct. Say it. Is it a roof, sir? No? No. I will show you. Jack... Daniels... Such an unlucky name! What's going from the bottom to the top, is the sales performance in the last month, of our company's North Kerala sales manager, Jack Daniels. What's coming down from the top to bottom, is that of Central Kerala sales manager, Samyukthan's. Samyukthan, can you please explain this? Sir, the line that goes up for Jack Daniels, is supported by the line at the bottom, right? That's why it's pointing upwards, right? Then, sir... Global economy... Global economy? Global Eco... Samyukthan, we have brand value! We have market penetration! But sales are not happening here alone! The circumstances in this country now, are really favourable for us. Robberies are increasing day by day, Samyukthan! Crime rate is going up! When I used to be a sales manager, this wasn't the situation. Still, I covered the target. See, the clarity of our CCTV camera during the night, is one of the best! Then why, Samyukthan? Then why? Why? Hey Sunoj! You rascal! Can't you see cameras from China being sold in the market for half the price? After drawing the roof of a house, you're messing with me? If Jack Daniels is getting business, what should I do? Samyukthan won't do any shady job to get business! I'm not interested in that, either. You and your damn college presentation! Fire me from here, if you dare! Then I'll show you who this Samyukthan is! Bloody Chunoj! Giving me scary looks, you loser? Well done, Samyukthan. Well done! This is what you need! Now you feel relieved, right? Yes. - That's it. Such a channelization of frustration, is what I intend to do through this occupational therapy. Sit down, please. Samyukthan... Our self-confidence. We have to create it ourselves! For example, your ringtone. That's the ringtone of a person with very low self-confidence. Listen to my ringtone! How's it? Yo! Rocking, right? Why don't you use this ringtone for a while? Each time you receive a call, you can feel the confidence rising like this! This is the equipment I told you about. You should use it daily if you can. The best time is between 6 - 7 PM in the evening. I mean, the peak time! You'll get a great yield! With maximum yield, you would get maximum relaxation! But one thing! No one else should see you while you use it, okay? Okay, sir. - Okay. When you do this exercise, you need great concentration! Don't forget the time. Between 6-7 PM. How come you're in a good mood today, sir? From today, I've decided to take a fresh approach to everything. We should turn this entire colony into a CCTV village. That would be great, sir. [Paramedu, Kannur District] Sir... This... Hold it lower, man. - That's the maximum. Or we should dig a grave here. That's the job you're best for. Grave-digging. - Stop looking down & measure up there. Trying to teach me? As per the sticker's position, someone who is 6 feet 3 inches tall has stuck it. Right, Pushpa? - Yes, sir. No chance that it would be lesser than that. I was going to say that to you! Didn't you see the sticker first? - Yes, sir. When was it? Some time back, sir. Have you seen anyone who's taller than usual in recent times in this area? No, sir. - Sir... This is the 4th incident. Everywhere the sticker is at the same height. So it must be the same person who stuck all of them. - Definitely. Sir, why don't we take all the fingerprints on this wall then? Why? That's not necessary, sir. - No? Sheesh! - Sir. We suspect if it's a group that sticks stickers in the morning, and then attacks in the night. That's also a possibility. If that's the case, he will come tonight. Right, Lawrence? Of course. He will definitely come. If sir says, it will happen. Have you all seen the movie 'Theeran'? Hey! That movie! People who barge in at night, hit people on their heads and rob stuff... It might be as simple as that. No need to worry. Chances are that it must be a group like that. All of you should stay alert. Sir, the people are all scared. Is it? Then don't open the doors in the night, no matter who knocks. Especially, people who are taller than 6 feet. You should arrange night patrolling on this route too, sir. Yes, sir. Lawrence, note it down. - Note it. - Okay, sir. Pushpa, you should have an eye on everything here. Not enough! This item is good! Item? Is this a product on sale? Well sir, since we are in sales... So? Leave that. Is there any point in all this? No point! Since mom and dad are from different religions, none of the alliances are working out. I used to go meet prospective brides all over Kerala. Now I've become selective. Don't bother about that. You woo the girl, sir. Hey! When I give you the gap to insert a needle, don't squeeze a shovel in! Get lost! Woo her? What's this? Hello Mahesh? What's the status? Dude, Thursday? It's a working day, right? Shall we try Sunday? Sunday won't work? Is it? Dude, I have some trouble in getting a leave. Sales are really bad. Okay. If I get leave, I'll start in my car, during the night itself. That will be easier. In that case, I can come back immediately after our programme. And yeah... Don't tell anyone about this. Okay? Bye. What is it, sir? - It was DYSP Ashok Kumar sir. He has called a meeting tomorrow. To discuss about how to increase the image of the police. He said something about 'Janamaithri' (Public-Friendly). That's necessary, sir. These days, no one is scared of the police. We should get back that fear. Didn't you hear those people yesterday? That they are really scared of the thieves! They can be scared of thieves, but not the police! I didn't like some of their questions! I knew it when I saw you being all serious! Would they have understood it? - Definitely. Everyone understood that you're really serious. How come you're very happy, Suku? Sir, we got a call from the area where the sticker was found yesterday. They said that a really tall Bengali was doing the rounds there, selling blankets. Then it must be him! If it was blanket yesterday, today it would be flower pots or cotton candy. Yes. - Lawrence! Pass the information to those who've gone on beat duty. Sir, he could be selling mosquito nets too. Yes. Pass that too! Sir, not just that. Flood relief, bed sheet sellers and installment sellers too! Then why don't we target those who sell guava, pineapple, apples, grapes, oranges, rambutan, etc on the road too? Yes, sir. Rambutan! - Get lost, man! Rambutan! Get lost! You pass the message. Blankets, cotton candy, flower pots, mosquito nets. Blankets, cotton candy, flower pots, mosquito nets. If you see any tall migrant worker selling these items, those who are on beat duty should report immediately. What is it, Samyukthan? You've been sitting here for a while now. Did you get any new order? Sir, an order from Jawahar Nagar colony would come any moment. And sir, I've cast a net for some large scale orders too. Very good. I wanted a day off on Thursday. Well, only if you give me permission. Is it enough if you keep taking days off very often, Samyukthan? When you're a manager, you should be doing some work too, right? Sir, my father has to be taken for a checking. Checking? - No. I mean, check-up. Anyway, let me think about it. Did you finish thinking, sir? Let me think, Samyukthan! We found a guy, sir. - Whom? The culprit of the sticker case? The tall guy? We got him! He's a blanket seller. He landed right in front of our beat duty officers. Impossible! And where is he now? They are somewhere near Paramedu market, waiting for us to go with the jeep. Then let's go there. You little devil! We have to go there, to meet important people. - Yes. Is this a sign? I thought you were scribbling. Isn't the meeting with DYSP today? Who will go there? Just to sit idle there, right? We'll send someone who doesn't have much work here. We can send Ashraf, sir. All of you, listen. We're going to arrest the culprit of an important case. Once we bring him here, Shibu sir will have a special interrogation session. The culprit may try to escape. So all of us should be alert, okay? To talk such things, we have sir here, and I'm also here. You do your job! Get into the vehicle. - I was giving them a warning. Should I come? - Come, Pushpa. Sir, shall I start? - Yes. What sticker? I didn't do anything, sir. - Who is it? Him? The height is correct, sir. We needn't suspect anyone else. It's him! Put him into the vehicle. Come! Get in, I say! You & your blanket sales! What are you guys watching? I'll put an end to your smiles. - I don't know anything, sir. [Speaking in Bangla] Him & his Hindi. I'll make you a Malayali with one punch! This damn thing is not even turning! - Where are you taking me, sir? I've called all of you here to discuss an important matter. As per the instructions received from the Central Government, as part of increasing the co-operation between the police and the public, we have decided to celebrate one day as 'Janamaithri' (Public friendly) day. The main objective of this day is to increase the positive image of the police. We need a scheme that can attract the public, that can be implemented by us and would increase our positive image. All of you think about it, and create a good action plan. Come on, think! Sir, what about a blood donation drive? Anyone can do blood donation drives, right? Think about ideas that are more innovative, popular, and can have participation from the public. You'll get it if you think. Go ahead, think! That's good! Shall we do some charitable works? Saumya... We're already doing charitable works, right? Something more accessible, something that can create a positive image for us, something that would make the people fond of us... How do I make you understand? Keep thinking. You'll get it! Yes, tell me. Sir, shall we conduct a group marathon, under your leadership. Sir, if you need a popular programme, group marathon is perfect. In that way, the public can also run along, right? Why? A group marathon isn't public friendly? Isn't it, sir? Yes. It's public friendly. But the public would be running along, booing at us. Which station are you coming from? From Paramedu station, sir. Sir, he's the constable there. Ashraf. He's from the batch which won medals & got the job through Kerala mini marathon. That's why he's so fond of running. - Where is your Sub Inspector? Well, Shibu sir has gone to collect evidence with the sticker case culprit. You needn't sit for this meeting. We'll inform the station what the decision is. Get out! Marathon, blood donation, charitable work. All are equally bad ideas! Isn't there anyone with some common sense in our force? Look at this Marathon runner! [speaking in broken Hindi] Put the sticker up! Stick it up there. - [speaking in Bangla] What? Sir, this is not Hindi. This is some jungle language. He doesn't even know Hindi properly. Yes, sir. Then ask him where he bought it from. Where did you bring the sticker from? Where? Did you bring it from North India? Yes! Yes! Sir, he brought it from North India. Ask him where else has he stuck it. Where else have you stuck the stickers? There he goes! - Catch him! I don't think we can manage with Suku's Hindi, sir. I was about to say that. - Is it? This blanket is 600 Rupees. I can give it to you for 300. Sir, he was talking about the stickers on blankets. Ask him why he's selling blankets in this summer. I haven't learned that much Hindi, sir. If it was a Malayali who did this, it would have been so easy for us. Then imagine the condition of policemen who question Malayalis who steal in the land of North Indians? Almost all Malayalis can at least speak in broken Hindi now. We study Hindi from 5th grade onwards, right? Isn't it from 4th grade? - No, sir. From 5th grade. Isn't it from 4th grade? - Sir, shall I start the vehicle? Yes, go ahead. - 4th grade & Hindi, it seems. Good! One life for one tea! The name of the scheme itself is very popular. We will start distributing tea from tomorrow 2 AM, on every important road. Shouldn't we arrange coffee for those who don't drink tea? Of course, we should. And all of you should keep some lemons too. We can cut it, squeeze it & give it to those who need lemon tea. We should make the drivers who drive during the night understand clearly that we're giving them tea and talking to them, to kill their sleep. They should never feel that we are troubling them. We might be able to save one life, with just a black tea. That's 'One life for one tea' scheme. Tea should be distributed under the leadership of SI's of all stations. To provide a safe and homely feel for lady passengers, at least one lady constable should be part of the team, compulsorily. Shoot a video of distributing tea on your mobile and send it to me. If this succeeds, I have no doubt that the police will have a positive image. Isn't it? Bhaiyya, where is this Brahmin's factory? Where in India? Brahmin? I'm not Brahmin. I'm a Thakur. Can't you realize that he's not Brahmin from his looks? Ask him properly! Tell me where this factory is! Bengal, Bhutan, Sikkim... Aren't these the names of lottery companies? If you don't know Hindi, admit it. We can call some Bengali. Where are you going, hiding from me? Mom, I have to go outside. 'One life for one tea' Can't you take someone along instead of going alone in the night? That's not necessary, mom. Mahesh is there, right? Okay then. Bye, dad. Call mom once you reach there. Drive carefully. He would reach early in the morning, right? - Yes. Dude, is there any problem with the chicken? There's some foul taste. Haven't you finished washing the glasses, Ashraf? Done, sir. There are only 15 glasses. Okay. Make it fast. Sir, should we give tea to the driver alone? If other passengers in the vehicle ask tea and we don't give them, our image would go for a toss! We need to think about that. If a tourist bus comes this way and all the passengers ask for tea, we will be in trouble, Ashraf. Of course! We will be in trouble! If it's a tourist bus, let's not stop them. Otherwise, 'one tea for one driver' scheme. That would be okay. We need to think about that too. I was about to say that. - Is it? That's such foolishness, sir. If the driver of that bus goes off to sleep, so many lives would be in danger! That's true, right? Sir, you shouldn't have worn it. When you wear it, you look like a road worker. No car has come this way in all this while. Anyway we've brought all this here, right? Shall we have one tea each? Suku! - Yes. One each. Let's give the first tea to our driver who's feeling sleepy. Give me one first. I'm feeling sleepy. Our first prey is coming. Look! The first prey. - No. Not a prey. A life! It's a life that's coming. Then let's get ready quickly. Suku, get up and come! Who is giving the first tea? - I will give it, sir. No need. It's our first offering, right? I... - Let Lawrence sir give it. Then let Lawrence sir give it. - Yes. Sir, I have all the papers. Let it be there. - The license is also okay, sir. No need, sir. - I have the PUC certificate too. Listen to sir, man! Be soft! Let the documents remain there. You are the first passenger of our 'One life for one tea' scheme, which we are conducting in this circle. Please come, drink a black tea and co-operate with us. Well sir, I don't need the black tea. If not black tea, we have other options. There's lemon tea, ginger tea, clove tea and milk tea! Or tell us a flavour that you like, sir. Sir, flavour is not my problem. Then? - Where are you coming from, sir? I started from Kochi last night. I saw him yawning! You must drink a glass of tea! Let it kill your sleep. You came all the way here, right? The intention of 'One life for one tea' scheme, is to kill the sleep of those who are feeling sleepy. Right, sir? Exactly! Please come. - Please. Park the car. - Come out, sir. Now we must make everyone drink it. - Yes. Or we'll have to drink all of it. No. Sir will drink it. Sir, this is Janamaithri Day. It's a scheme by the Central Government. This is a programme we're conducting in this circle to celebrate that. Sir, I can reach my friend's house if I drive for one hour more. I'm not feeling sleepy, sir. Drink this, I say! - Hey! Please hold it. - Drink! Drink! Drink it, sir. Let your sleep go away. - Shoot a video. Just a minute. - Go ahead, drink it. Shoot it fast. Shoot it. - Stand closer. Please drink it. Ashraf, move in. - Ashraf, you're not in the video. Where are you standing? Move away! Stand at the back! At the back! - Please drink it. Please smile, sir. Sir, 'V'... Show a 'V'. - Seems like sir didn't like the cardamom's taste. It's not that. It's because it was just a tea. Pushpa, give him something to munch on. - Give me that biscuit. You're holding it there? Give it! Eat it, sir. Go ahead, sir. Eat it. Please chew it. Sir, chew it. Chew it. Drink it! Did you get it? - Awesome. Here comes the next life. Hold this. Stop! Stop! Drink it, sir. Blow on it and drink. It might be strong! Dip the biscuit in it and eat it. Eat it. Eat it! We'll give you another flavour after drinking this. So we should drink the tea that you give us. Yes. When you drink it, you'll lose your sleep. That's 'One life for one tea' scheme. Then we'll drink it, sir. What's in the truck? - Some clothes from Madurai, sir. Clothes? - Do you have Churidar pieces? Yes, sir. Dip it, eat it and drink the tea in one gulp. Get it done with. Go ahead. Drink it. Sir... Lawrence... I think they haven't understood what our scheme is, properly. Didn't I say everything correctly? You didn't say that there would be accidents if they sleep while driving. Rest everything is okay. Sir, there's a problem. - What problem? Sir, Samyukthan badly needs to take a shit. - Which Samyukthan? Sir, the first life we saved? He said his name when his stomach gave him trouble. Samyukthan! Then I need to see that! What? Him shitting? - Sheesh! Lawrence! We should remember to ask everyone's name first. That's basic decency. Come. He looks so decent, but he wants to shit as soon as he had a glass of tea! Why? Decent people don't shit? I drink so much tea! - Who said you're decent? Suku! - Sir. What is it, Samyukthan? What happened? Well sir, he's saying that he wants to use a toilet. He drank a hot tea, right? So... If you want to use a toilet, shouldn't you go ahead? Didn't you say that your friend's house was nearby? I don't think I can reach till there. Why are you so particular in taking it till there? You should do something, sir. You compelled me to drink tea, right? Why are you saying so, Samyukthan? Anyway you lost your sleep, right? Otherwise would we know this now? Don't hold it tight. Go to the field and do it there! Ashraf, go behind him with a mug of water. Sir, from the way he's standing, I don't think one mug would be enough. Is it? - Sir, I'm not comfortable doing it on the field. Yes, sir. I had told him to go to the ground. But he's saying that he needs a hygeienic toilet, for it to happen. Sir, it's not just that. If I sit on a field, the grass would tickle from the bottom. That's correct, sir. There's a special kind of grass. It's really ticklish. If there's nettle grass, it might start itching too. Shucks! This is a big problem! Will we have to change it to 'One toilet for one tea'? Sir... We didn't get tea. Sorry. I forgot. I'll bring it. You wait here. Take Samyukthan to some toilet. How will I take him to a toilet at midnight, sir? I washed all the glasses here, bought sugar & tea powder, I did all the work here. Let Suku sir go. - Sir, I'll tell you one thing openly. I don't have the talent to make someone shit at midnight! You don't need talent for that! He's the one who's shitting! You just have to go along! It's not a tour to go along. He's going to shit, right? Why don't you go then? You tell him strictly, sir! Understand that you're playing around with a man who has swallowed a ball of fire! Ashraf, carry on! Sir, I'm also a policeman. Don't undermine me like this. I got into this job through sports quota, to serve the country! And not to make people shit! Serving the country is serving the people. This is also a service, Ashraf! Sir, give him an order. As part of Central Government's Janamaithri Day, and as the in-charge of 'One tea for one life' scheme, conducted at Paramedu station limits, Ashraf should find a clean toilet in some house, and help Samyukthan take a shit, and report its progress to me, minute by minute. This is my order! That's what! Go fast! I don't think I can drive. Will you be able to shit? - Yes. Give me the key. Don't make him lift anything heavy. Don't drive through gutters too. Okay sir. I'll take him to a toilet. Slowly... You have a license, right sir? Get going! Phew! Who's going to come next? Do you want a biscuit? - No. How about you? Have one! Sir, don't be angry. I'm not doing this on purpose. I told you many times that I don't want it. But you all compelled me and.... Anyone would be angry! I went as an escort to the home minister last week. And now I'm going to make you shit! Sir, I had Parotta, chicken and intestine curry from a street food shop on the way. So it might be because of that... Did you eat from a shop you know? - No, sir. You shouldn't eat non-veg from shops you don't know. Especially when you're travelling, avoid food as much as you can! Or else, eat only vegetarian food. In case, if you're so particular, ask them to add extra ginger, garlic and vinegar while making it. If that's done, we can eat even a chicken that was bitten by a fox. Sir, I can't see any house here! Don't give over-expectations to your body, Samyukthan! Kerala Police will find a pristine toilet for you, Samyukthan! Over there! - That house? Sir, please stop. Sir, look. That house will be okay. I think they would definitely have a good toilet. - Yes. Come. Get out carefully. Slowly...! Oh my God! Stomach pain! That's okay. That pain will go once you're done with this. Walk! Come. Haven't you heard of 'Shubhasya Sheekhram'? That means things will end well, very fast. That's how it is. Come. Can't hear anything! At this hour, you won't be hearing much. Samyukthan, here they are. Namaste. Hey! It's the police. - Police? Sir, ask them to open the door. Wait, Samyukthan. - What is it, sir? Sister, he wants to use the toilet here very urgently. He got stuck in a programme we conducted at the junction. Sister, just give me 10 minutes. It's really urgent. He wants to shit! When dad's not here, how can we... They will open it. Sir, my husband is not here. Where did he go? He was supposed to reach earlier. The train got late by 12 hours. That's why. He could've taken a bus, right? He's getting late because he took the Central Government's train, right? There's Kerala Government's KSRTC service that will bring him right on time. Now they've started lightning fast services too. Their timing is very sharp. They will bring him right on time! Ask your husband to consider KSRTC from the next time onwards. - Sir... Didn't she say that there are only women here? Only if I tell them about lightning services, her husband can reach right on time hereafter. Sir, let's go. - Is that so? Then... Shall we leave? Sir, it's because my husband isn't here. Please don't mind. It's okay, sister. He will manage. He is really brave! Come. Don't worry about this, Samyukthan! I will find you a toilet where the husband is at home! Come. Can you see a house there? Shall we go there? - Yes. Come. Get into the car. - Sir. I can't sit in the car squeezing my tummy again. Let's walk. Will you be able to take it till there? The option of the field is still open! Sir, let's go. - Okay. Well, I didn't mean to mock you. Don't be upset about it. If anyone comes, don't run away. Wait for my command, okay? No. I'll be outside. You go inside. Lift me! Climb, you idiot! All clear. Don't go in front. Follow me. Get up! - I'm trying! Get up! You can do it! Didn't I tell you that I will stick it? - Stop! Stop! Done? - Did it touch the ground? Yes. Are you done? My dear Samyukthan, if you keep choking like this, you'll go up, before the shit comes down. Understood? Even if something goes down, I won't tell anyone. Sir, the gate is locked. Gates are constructed to be locked, right? Understood? - What do we do now? Come. Let's jump. Damn it! Cops! Come. - Sir, I can't! Sorry. Climb up, man! - No, sir. It will be a problem! Place your hand here and jump using your left leg. Understood? Climb! Come on! Damn it! - Climb! Come on! Climb! Keep your hand here. Keep your leg here slowly. Bring your body here. Slowly! Slowly! It'll go loose now! Nothing is gone, right Samyukthan? Slowly. Sir, I can't even take one step forward. Samyukthan, you should face such instances in life with composure. Come. Come, Samyukthan. You can do this easily. Come! Samyukthan... In this journey forward called life, we will have to overcome many such instances. We should hold on, until we reach our destination. We shouldn't fall prey to such tender emotions. I myself reached this position by overcoming several such instanes! It's the mind that controls the body. You can definitely control it with your mind. Stand here. You can do it now. Wait. Can you see a door there? Let me go see if it's a toilet. And yeah... Mind is the mirror of the body, Samyukthan. Poor guy. Damn it. Shall I make him sit here? No! It won't work. Poor guy. The light is on! This is why! No responsibility, at all! Sir, what happened? That's not a toilet, man! They have stored cement and bricks there. If it's a house, they need to have a toilet outside, right? If that was there, it'd have helped Kerala Police. If they don't open this, will you be able to take this load to the next house? - SIr!! Don't worry. I was just asking. Hey! It's the police. - Police? - Yes. What's the matter? - I didn't ask. You also come. Who knows if it's the actual police! What is it, sir? Brother, my name is Ashraf. I'm a policeman from Paramedu police station. Please give him a chance to use the toilet here. Why, sir? Is there any problem with the toilet at the station? The toilet at the station is fine. He got stuck in Central Government's Janamithri day scheme. Please co-operate with Kerala Police. It's only a matter of 10 minutes. No! No! Just 5 minutes are enough. Yes. Just 5 minutes. It's only a matter of 5 minutes. Please. What's the guarantee that he's from the police? Sir, don't mind me asking. What's the guarantee that you're a policeman? These are times when thieves disguise themselves as policemen. That's why I asked. Well, please understand his situation. Well, sir if 2 strangers come to a house at midnight, and say that they want to shit, anyone would get scared, right sir? If you ask me so... I'll ask you a question for a confirmation. If you give the right answer, I'll open the door immediately. Ask him who's the Police chief of Kerala. Then ask it quickly, my dear brother. Who's the police chief of Kerala? Good question. Come on, say it. Sheesh! I knew it. - Say it, sir. Say it! Who is it? Shaji! Shaji! - Shaji? That Shaji... Pashanam Shaji (actor). Pashanam... - No, sir. The guy who looks like Pashanam Shaji. Behra! Behra! - Behra? Say it, man! It's Behra. Behra. Ram Prakash Behra. Isn't that the correct answer, brother? - Of course. You're being disrespectful, huh? Go inside. Slowly. Don't drop it on the way. Go confidently! I'll be waiting outside. Which toilet do we give him? The one in the guest room? It's been 2-3 days since we cleaned it. Then let's send him to the bedroom. Brother... Go that way. - That way? What? What is this? Mahesh...! Ask our daughter not to step outside her room. Seems like too much cow dung was used. Where is this guy? Is he staying there permanently? Your name? Sayooj. Here you are! What happened, Samyukthan? Were you sitting inside the commode? Let's not talk about it, sir. What happened? Didn't he say that we'll not talk about it. And yeah, that third Bougainvillea's leaves are all withered. Pour water on it, from time to time. Let the sun rise, sir. You've become all smart after shitting, huh? It's been so long since I saw a smile on his face. Then why don't you both take a leave? Okay. And yeah... That car's boot was open. So the light was also on. The battery would drain out completely, and it won't start in the morning. Didn't you close the boot after taking the bananas out? I forgot. These are times when thieves are in plenty! Don't come to the station complaining that you lost bananas, mind it. Get me the key. Let me open the gate for them. - Come, Samyukthan. Many thanks from Kerala Police for opening your toilet for us. That's all right. Aren't you locking it, brother? It's already dawn, sir. Why should I lock now? Anyway whatever has to come, will jump over the gate and come. Or I'll put this chain around it. - Okay then. How did you get this name 'Samyukthan'? Sir, my dad & mom are from 2 different religions. So, since I'm the 'Samyuktha' (joint) son, they named me Samyukthan. So that's how you got this name? I wanted to ask this.. But when you badly wanted to shit... Oh no! Snake! What is it? - Nothing, sir. Nothing? Stop there! - Sir, my key! Sir, give my key and go! Catch him first. There he goes! Sir, catch him! - Catch him! Sir, climb up! Climb! Or move. Samyukthan, you climb. - Okay. Come, sir. It's simple. Come! Move! Sir, wait. I'm also coming. I sent you both for engineering at Pollachi, so that you'll be of some use to the family! Neither did you learn the functioning of machines... Nor do you understand the difference between a nut & a bolt, you donkeys! If we had two engineers at home, there would've been so many benefits for the technical side of our family business. Sad! Didn't I tell you that there's no change in the price I quoted? No bargaining! Don't disturb. I'm at work. It's because they teach the functioning of machines in English over there... That is the problem, brother. Okay. Leave all that. At least now, stay with me, and learn our business & its techniques. You should ask doubts. Doubts are meant to be asked. Remember one thing. In any business, the flaw in planning is the root cause of failure. Especially, in our family business. Bro, I have a doubt. - Ask me. Is that what's called family planning? I don't care that it's the road. I'll push you down! This is the only mistake our dad made. Family planning, it seems. - It was a doubt. Okay. Forget the past. Think about the future. You must learn quickly. You should become independent within one year. You need to open branches on your own. Bro, I have another doubt. It should be decent. - Yes, of course. We're going for work now, right? Then why have we dressed up like we're going for an interview? - Good question. Every job has its own dignity. To do that, you need to have some aesthetics. It's said that we should be dressed up, even while lying dead. So are you taking us to get us killed? Idiot! - What tics? - You told us to ask doubts! Aesthetics means beauty of art. We need that in the way we work, and in our appearance. Understood? - Yes. - Wait. Listen carefully. For what we're going to do next, what you need the most, is courage. Even if the circumstances are extremely difficult, we shouldn't lose courage. The only asset our ancestors have given is... courage. Panjimoottil Mathayi's sons shouldn't destroy the name & fame they earned! Don't give up courage under any circumstance. That's our only capital. Let's pray. O' God Almighty, Jesus, the all powerful... Please let our mission today be successful. On the path of my little brothers who're beginning a new life today, save them from stones, thorns and wolves in hiding. Bless us like you have blessed our ancestors. Amen! - Amen. Whatever happens, we'll be together! Come! Come! Chew softly, man! No dogs. - Good! We're lucky. The gate is not locked. That much work is done. Shall we open it? Don't hurry. Why are you pouring that? - To kill ants. Shut up. Pour it over there. Don't pour the whole thing. We need to fry fish for lunch. So it's fish fry today! I'll pour it. - I'll pour it. Wait. Stop. Come. - Tell me before going. Stop. Stop! Nothing happened. - Keep quiet. First, we need to touch it and see. Yes. Feel the vehicle. Then we've to put it in and see. - What? Crap! Shut up! - No. Then we should pray to the Father & the Son.... Fantastic! Awesome, right? - Awesome. [Praying] - Okay bro. Slowly... - Push it. Was it so heavy? - I'm pushing hard. Shut up! Slowly! Slowly! Stop! Stop! Bus and cinema tickets? Why do you need these tickets? Act now. Ask later. - I haven't taken that. Where's the chilli powder? How much are you chewing? Wow! Flower! Samyukthan, don't give up. Come! Bro, one selfie. I'll put it in the group. Which is that flower? Where is it from? It's pretty, right? I took it from that house. This is so bad! If we go to take something, take that alone. That sister who planted that, would be so sad when it's missing in the morning! It won't be as much as the sadness when they realize that their car is missing. And this flower? It will grow again. - Bro... Shall we steal this car as well? No! - Red car. We shouldn't be greedy. If we have taken something, focus on that alone. You and your gospel! You won't understand what I'm saying right now. You'll understand it when you're my age. Understood? So, for me to understood what you said, it should be 2026. You will understand at least in 2026. For me, it would be 2028. Oh my God! Make them understand what I'm saying, at some point of time! When did I even... Hey! Give me my bike & go! Stop there! I need to distribute newspapers! You scoundrel! Return my bike! Sir, a masked rascal stole my bike. Sir, our running went wasted. Why did you park the bike on the road-side? Should I park it on the middle of the road instead, sir? I am not blaming you, but you should have been careful. Sir, I was going to distribute newspapers... So you're from the press? - Yes, sir. What's your name? - Sunny. Sunny, from the press. Sir, he ran so fast. - Leave that. I slipped at a couple of places. Otherwise you'd have seen...!! He has gone with my daily bread, sir. Didn't you say that it had newspapers? - Not that, sir. Oh! I understood. Do one thing. Come with us to the police station. - Okay sir. Give us a written complaint. Sir, shouldn't we get my car? Oops! That's also right. Paramedu junction is close by, right? His car is over there. Let's go there. So you were running without any idea? We can't go there through this way. We need to take the main road. There are some short-cuts. We'll take them. Sir, my bike? Okay. Come. Why do you distribute newspapers so early in the morning? I need to tap rubber after that, sir. Mr. Sunny, you should be doing it the other way round. You should tap rubber at dawn. If you do so, the rubber milk will just flow seamlessly! Is it profitable to distribute newspapers on the bike? - How, sir? Since we're filling petrol, Government will get some money to build toilets. Today there were supplements too. - Come on, walk. Let's go get the car and catch the thief. Come. Sheesh! There's no Bluetooth connectivity in this car. Then turn on the FM. Hey! There would be an AUX cable in the dash board. Check! Where? There's nothing in here. This guy is a miser, bro. We can't get everything together! I had told you that we'll take a BMW or an Audi. But you needed only a Tata. This is not for us to drive forever. We need to scrap this & sell it today or tomorrow. But we could have driven it proudly, as long as we have it with us. When it's a theft, especially a vehicle theft... you need to be careful about two things. We need to steal cars that can be sold easily. Secondly... Audi, BMW, Mercedes... Those who use these cars, would be quite influential. They will catch us at any cost. But when it's ordinary folk, by the time they do the rounds at police stations, we can crush this to pieces & send it to the destination. Understood? Understood. - And yeah... Your attitude that this is our car as long as we're using it. I like that. Keep it up. - Thank you. Bro, what if the police identifies us? For every plan A, there will be a plan B. I'll teach that to you, when the situation arises. Turn off that light. Bro... Look. It's the police. Where? - Over there. Sir, they have stopped the car there. - Yes. Shall we take the tea there? - Why? What's the need for that? No need? - Sheesh. Don't bring shame to the police. You want to take the tea there? Bro, what do we do? We're trapped. Shall we leave the car & run? Or, shall we turn the car and take a different route? If we run, they will run behind us & catch us. If we turn the car, they will chase & catch us. They have the wireless machine. We don't have it. We need to use our intelligence now. Do we have that, bro? If I had that, would I bring you for this job? Bloody fool! Panjimoottil Mathayi's sons shouldn't earn the bad name... of being chased and caught by the police. Start the car. Let's deal with it. Okay bro. - Go ahead. Suku, ask them to pull over. Panjimoottil Mathayi's children shouldn't earn the bad name of being chased and caught by the police. Start the car. Let's deal with it. Okay bro. - Go ahead. Suku, check whether they are 'without'. True. There are many people who drive without clothes during night. You are the limit. I was talking about sugar. Stop! Stop there. Sir, shall we make tea? - Yes. Come. Sir, he's talking in English! No. I know Malayalam, sir. Move this thing away. They've stopped, right? What did Suku say, sir? About clothes? Clothes... Oh! Nothing! He says all those dumb things, and you're curious about them? Pour the tea. Today is a special day. - Oh! Is it? For us too. There's a small programme by Kerala Police. Is it? We were going to a place urgently... Yes. You can go quickly. Suku, bring it here. He'll bring it now. What is the scheme? - 'One life for one tea' scheme. That's the name of the scheme. So nice! One tea? So is it okay if just one person comes out? - No. All of you should come out. Come out. - Okay. Please come out. Come. Namaste. I am Paramedu SI Shibu. Namaste. - Namaste. For the safety of the drivers who feel sleepy while driving through Kannur district, This is not my driver. They are my younger brothers. is it? - They never sleep at night. They sleep during the day. Very nice to meet you. It's a scheme we have planned for drivers who feel sleepy while driving, by giving them a black tea to kill their sleep. That is 'One life for one tea' scheme. - Very nice. It's a scheme that's really beneficial for ordinary citizens like us. Shall we drink some tea then? - Why not? Pushpa, give it. Here, sir. - Drink it. Take it! They don't accept anything from strangers. They are really shy. Is it? Don't think of us as strangers. Suku, take it. - What, sir? Crap! - Crap? Take a video, man! Well, why did you stop your car there for a while? When we saw your fluorescent clothes, we thought road work was going on. We were checking if there were other routes to go. Ashraf had told us about this! Now see! Where are you going? Well... I'm taking these guys to make them write the PSC exam. Highly educated! What exam is it? To become engineers. Very good. Why have you left so early? We're used to leaving early, sir. - That's how they have been raised. Very nice habit. What time did you leave? As soon as dinner was done. - Yes. So you left that early. Then you must be really hungry. One boy is chewing on his own. - Poor guy, must be hungry. Pushpa! - What, sir? - Give them biscuits. Where is your house? There! At Iritty! Iritty is not there. It's over here. Yes. Iritty is over here. How come you have a flower with you? To keep it in front of Christ and pray, before the exam. Why would Christ need a flower now, right? You can keep it, sir. The one who saves lives, is the real God. Right, bro? What all are you saying? They won't like all that. It's evidence. - We like it. It's coming from his heart. Let him say it. He's saying it honestly, right? Give it to me. Can you take it back? - Super. Here. - Thanks. I'll hold it, sir. Bro! Shall we leave then, sir? - Okay. The boys have to study some more. If we stay any longer, we'll get late for the exam. One more tea? - No, sir. We're really happy! Thank you so much! Really happy. - We're leaving. Get in. You have to study a lot. Make it fast. - Yes. Go! Go! Go! - Okay! All the best! Bye! Go fast. Go slowly. If we go fast, they will feel doubtful. Such nice brothers, right? Of course! They're going to write the exam in the morning itself! It was Raghavan Nair. Who? - Yes. Meledathu Raghavan Nair from the movie 'Valsalyam'. Was it him? - Didn't you see? The innocent elder brother who loves his younger brothers. Will we reach anytime soon? Sir, if we go straight and take two more turns... These two turns would be around..? - 3.5 kms away... 3.5 kms? We ran just for 3 kms to reach there, and now you've made us walk 6.5 kms! Sir, we realized we took a wrong short-cut only when we took it, right? Now we've taken a different route. So, is this a short cut? - This is another short cut. I'm so furious, sir. I should have jumped on top of the bike from that gate. Never do that. They might have fatal weapons with them. Did you notice a stone tied to the end of a rope, with the guy who ran away now? It's a fatal weapon used for Kung Fu in China. Sir, I've seen it somewhere. Yes. There was its competition in the last Olympics. As you said, China won gold in it. - See! Hey! Sunny from the press! In such situations, we should act maturely. They have nothing to lose, right? Sir, as a member of the press, can I stay away from my duty? Tell me! Sunny, didn't you say that you distribute newspapers? No! I write the obituary columns as well. There's someone like this at my house too. My sister's son. He keeps talking non-stop. He won't let anyone speak a word. He says that he wants to be a journalist. Yes, sir. Send him for that job. But one thing. Teach him to ride a bike. Why? - Shouldn't he distribute newspapers? That's correct. You and your damn flower! You handed over the evidence to the police! Fool! Sorry bro! Shall we go and get it back? To go back there? We had a narrow escape from them somehow. And you want to go back? Leave it. How was it in general? The tea was good, but if we got 2 biscuits too, it'd have been great. Not that! Did you understand how to deal with policemen? Yes, understood. Bro, when I drank the tea, I swallowed the bubble gum by mistake. How can something in your mouth go in without your knowledge? I swallowed it in between all that commotion. Is it a problem? It will be a problem. Didn't you blow the bubble gum and burst it earlier? Like that, when you breathe out, it will become big, burst & stick to your intestine! How do we know if it would reach the intestine? What if it gets stuck on the lungs? This would be on the intestine. Then, like a balloon at the edge of a balloon, it will get blown into a huge bubble and then explode & stick on to the intestine! Lil' bro... Don't take deep breaths. Take it slow. If he doesn't breathe, he'll die without oxygen. If he breathes, it will burst, stick on the intestine & he'd die. Anyway, he'll die. You don't worry. Stop! Stop! Seems like a newspaper guy. Give him a tea, Lawrence. Why sir? The newspaper guy would be from this town. He would have had tea before leaving. Moreover, that moron hasn't worn a helmet. Still, it's a life! Then we'll give him. Pushpa, one tea. Yes, sir. - Why are you wearing a mask, boy? Where is your helmet, kiddo? Sir, I left in a hurry. So I forgot to take it. Come. Sir, don't charge a petty case. Set me free somehow. Oops. I can't set you free. It's sir who has that power. Sir, he has asked me to set him free somehow. Is your hand infected or what? Can't you set him free? Why do you wear things that you can't bear on your neck, son? There's a stone, thread, rope and what not! What is this for? To chase dogs away, sir. If they see this, any dog would come after you. - Is it? Are you a newspaper guy? - No, sir. Then why are you carrying all this? To make paper planes? Actually, I'm a newspaper guy, sir. I forgot that because I'm sleepy. Are you feeling sleepy? - Yes. Will you drink tea? - I shall. Pushpa, give him tea. - I'm bringing it, sir. Here's your tea. - Tea...? Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. - Come on! Suku, check if the news of us catching the culprit of the sticker case has come out. There might be a photo too. They had taken it. Sir, they have printed an awesome photo. Is it? Let me see. Not yours. The culprit's. I shouldn't have given it. I need to go distribute the newspapers. But I shall tell you something! You can't go around without a helmet, because you're from the press. Or else, ride a cycle to go and distribute newspapers. Okay. I'll buy a cycle, sir. Doesn't that mean that he won't wear a helmet even then? Oh no! Not like that, sir. I'll wear a helmet even if I'm on a cycle, hereafter. Okay. Go fast. Leave a children's magazine at the station. - The fortnightly too. We need it daily. - Okay. Will the fortnightly come daily? - Of course. If he's a good guy, he'll bring a monthly magazine also, daily. Oh no! My tummy is enlarging, bro! I said that just to scare you. It's nothing. It will go away. No! If I die, you both want to eat up our father's wealth, right? Take me to a hospital! What's he saying? Stop the car. Let me see what's in his throat! Won't even let me lie down. Listen to me. If you eat 2 bananas, it will go out smoothly. Do something, bro. Get me the first aid box. Let me see if I can take it out from his throat. I told you when I saw you chewing like a cow, that this might happen! From now on, if you put anything into your mouth without telling me, I'll stitch up your mouth. Mind it! Can't find anything when we need it! I've told you both that we need everything required for an emergency surgery in this. Idiots. - Sorry. Oh no! My tummy will blow up like a bubble gum and burst any moment! Bro, at least give me some water. There's no water either. - Is there an empty bottle? Yes. - If so, there's a tap after the 4th mile turning, We'll fill it from there. Then go fast. Oh no! Do something quickly! You won't die. - Is it? It's almost time for sunrise. I told them I'd deliver this at 9 AM. And we haven't left Paramedu yet. We're lucky, sir. If it's raining, we cannot take this route. Yeah right! We walked 9.5 kms at dawn since we're very lucky! Don't fall from the rocks, sir. If you fall, you won't be able to get up from your bed. No point saying that you're a policeman then. - Hey sir! - Slowly. You should jump carefully. What happened, Samyukthan? - I have a pulled muscle, sir. Must be because you're running & walking so much for the first time. Usually policemen don't get pulled muscles, right sir? Don't you get training? Sheesh! I'm not a policeman. Sheesh? I'm the central Kerala sales manager of the famous company, Spyers. Of what? Sir, Spyers. Security cameras. Haven't you heard? It's famous. - No. I think I've heard about it, sir. Pushpa... The clean glasses are over. What do we do now? We should give tea if someone comes, right? How will I wash the glasses, sir? These are times of the 'Woman Wall'. Oh no! Then no need. I'll make Suku wash it. - Good idea. Suku, come here. Wash 10 glasses. - Ask Pushpa to do it, sir. When I told her, she's talking about the 'Woman Wall'. Then don't say anything. Washing glasses reminds me.... Where is our Ashraf? It's been 2 hours since he took him to shit. That's true. I was about to say that. Ashraf... - Look at him giving me the flower. Suku has captured it very well. He could have shot it a little better. But nice flower, right? Yes. It's been 2 hours since Ashraf took that guy to make him shit. They haven't come back. That's true! Would some wild elephant have trampled them to death? Is it paining here? - Over here. Here? Is it here? - Yes. This is the kidney's area. When you peed today, did any stone drop along with it? No? Then it must be a pulled muscle. Raise your hand like this. Can't do it? - No. Come. Turn around. Now stretch your hand like this. After that, lock it like this... No! No! No! Samyukthan, are you the one with a pulled muscle, or me? Me. - Right? I held the opposite way. That's why. Move this side. Sir, no need of such big techniques. Can't we rest here for 5 minutes & go? - That's enough. I've received so much training to save lives from Kerala Police. This pull will be eased with a slight twist! Is it necessary? What if some other place gets twisted? I have twisted so many wrong places! Turn around! Hey! Place your body here. Bring your hand here. Careful. Oh no! Sir, my ribs would shatter! Leave me. - Sir... Ashraf, it's been 2 hours since you took him to shit. Why haven't you reported yet? Sir, I was in a chase. - Chase? Why do you have to chase to take a shit? Not to shit. It was an original chase, sir. But you didn't report that too! Sir, the chase just got over. Whatever it is, tell me clearly. Yes, sir. The one who lost the bike is with me. - Then come fast. - Yes, sir. I'll come to the station. Should I send the jeep? - No, sir. We have Samyukthan's AC car. Let that be. Did he shit? - Yes, sir. Samyukthan defecated. We're coming there after his defecation. - Defecation? What is it, sir? Ashraf was chasing a thief. That thief toppled a newspaper guy and escaped with his bike. Was it the newspaper guy whom we gave tea to? My God! - It won't be him, sir. Our newspaper guy went a different way. Then which newspaper guy? Don't worry, sir. If not anything else, he has a stone with a rope tied to it. He can't be toppled so easily. The condition of people working at odd hours is quite sad. Samyukthan, you've become smart after the pulled muscle got healed. Come on, walk. Did you see Shibu sir's involvement? - Yes, sir. He is very professional. - Yes. Shibu sir got the 'Vadakkedathamma' award for the best SI last year. 'One flower for one tea'? That's nice. Let me call Shibu. Sir, such night duties are quite difficult. Isn't all this a service? - What service! It's Ashokan sir. He must have seen the video we sent him. Shibu, I saw the video. It's very good. The public should give us flowers like this. Understood? - Thank you, sir. And yeah, I'm going to post this video on Facebook. I need a good caption for this handing over of the flower. 'Flower offering' - Flower offering? 'A flower offering for the Police' How's it, sir? 'A flower offering for the Police' I'll write something. You spent so many hours, right? You can stop it now. If we're lucky, the official page of Kerala Police will share this. I'm pulling strings for that. - Okay. Okay! Okay! Well done! 'Flowers' 'Orchid flowers' I hope I get 10K likes and 1K shares by the time I come back after jogging. 'I turned into a butterfly in my early morning dream today' Hey! Make a black tea. I'll go get the newspaper. I'm making it. Who left the gate open like this? The newspaper hasn't come yet? Hey! Oh no! My car! Hey! Come here! There's the pork that you ate one week back in your mouth, even now. The chewing gum is missing. I can't see it. - Open it further. I can't open it any further. I can't see anything. I think it has gone inside. Do you feel relieved? I do. Something like a jack fruit fell down. Get out and see! It's some rubber tapper who fell from the top. Bro! What happened? Why did you go on top to tap rubber? The good milk is at the bottom, right? I think he fell from the helicopter that sprays fertilizers. Did you see it? - No. - Give me water. Who are you? What do you want? Newspaper! - Newspaper? - In the helicopter? Bro, I think he's a scrap dealer. There are old newspapers with him. No! I'm a newspaper guy. Are you a press officer? Get up. Did something happen? - What happened to you? I crashed the bike. So you crashed the bike! The bike crashed. Where? It's a car we earned with our hard work. Bro, all this is crushed. The bumper is gone! You'll have to pay quite a bit. I'll get it repaired now itself. Let's go to a workshop. Shall we go then? Will workshops open so early? They won't! That's okay. These are small mistakes caused due to carelessness. It can happen to anyone, right? - Yes. Don't try to claim insurance for this. That will be a huge hassle!. - No way! Are Panjimoottil Mathayi's sons that cheap? - Never. Then tell me an amount. Let's settle it right now. The boot is fine, right? Leave it. Nothing happened to us, right? No. - You have to distribute newspapers, right? Let's go quickly. Help him. Pick up all the papers. Lift that bike too. Lift it. Come. Let's talk. Bro, I think its handle is jammed. It's not moving. That's trouble! Was the handle jammed before falling? - No. No? - Or do one thing. Drop me at the next junction. I'll bring some mechanic from there & get it repaired. All of us can leave quickly. Is that enough? You're okay, right? - Yes. Hey! How are you? I feel relieved now, bro. How are you? I was already fine, bro. That's true. Shall we go then? Let's go. - Come on! What is this stone chain? Did you wear it to go to some temple or church? No! This is to throw at dogs! Phew! I got really confused! All are today's newspapers. Shall I take one? Of course. Take one more! Take two more. Let's make up for the broken bumper. We don't have time to read one, and you want two? Please get in. You get in first, bro. - Phew. Learn from him. - He's so simple. - Start the car! After me, then. What happened on your forehead, sir? That happened while chasing the guy who took your gruel! Not gruel, sir. Bread. Bread it is, then. What is this, man? What road is this? - Sir, it's the road once we get down this slope. People will be going to the church now. We can ask them for a lift. Where we come from, short cuts take us faster to the destination. This is my town, sir. I'll get you a lift. What's the point in me working for the press then? Sir, I think a car is coming. Move! - Oh my God! Sir... catch! Oh no, bro! Police, again! Stop! Stop! Pull over. - Please stop. Namaste, I... Well, it's my brother who takes all the decisions. - Is it? Hello! Namaste. I am Ashraf, PC from Paramedu police station. - Is it? We participated in Paramedu station's 'One life for one tea' scheme, got SI Shibu sir's blessings, and now I'm taking my boys to write the PSC test. Is it? - I swear. He's the one who inaugurated it. Is it? - Yes. Glad to meet you. Hello sir. - Glad. On our way back from there, we got stuck in a small problem. Once we solved that problem somehow, another problem came up. We were also stuck in a small problem similarly... Why should we hurt them by telling them about our problems? So we were coming from there. Well, his car is parked at the next junction. Can you please drop us there? We have such rotten luck today! Don't insult us, sir. Shouldn't we do at least that much for the tea we drank? Please get in. - Thanks a lot. The facilities are quite less. All of you should adjust, please. You've sweat quite a lot, sir! Sweat? One bugger turned my blood into water! He made us chase him since dawn. If I lay my hands on him.... Are you okay, sir? - Yes. I'll smash him to pulp! You should, sir. If you get him. Let's go! It's a little tight, right? - It's close by. We'll reach now. If it's difficult for you to travel, I can get down and walk. Son, Panjimoottil Mathayi's sons don't forget the path they came through. We don't ditch anyone on the way, as well. Are we troubling you? - No way. No, sir. Never. Oh no! - What happened, sir? Something pricked me! Don't worry, sir. Whatever it is, we have the tools to take it out. I myself perform some surgeries on my boys. Don't worry, sir. Don't be scared. Hey! Stop the car for a minute. - Okay. Pull over. - It's bleeding. Something is over there. Try to take it out yourself, sir. Try! Try! It will come out. You'll get it. Try! Take it out slowly. Take it out yourself. What is it? Is this what pricked you? It must have pained a lot. That's a stone chain used by this boy to chase dogs away. Forgive him, sir. What is it, sir? What is it, brother? Sir, it's him! It's him! Trying to fool us by lifting your mask, you loser? How did this bike thief get into your car? He stole it? He crashed the bike behind our car, and we were going to drop him at the next junction. Where is my bread? I haven't taken any bread. The bike is lying safely where it crashed. That's my bread! You're quite healthy! Can't you work to earn a living? If you're jobless, can't you write PSC tests like us? Enough! Stop! Son, take the car to the station. - Oh no, sir. We're already late for their PSC test. And we came back a long way too. Sir, that's true. Why should we take such decent people to the station? We can go in my car, right? Sir, my car is nearby. Just drop us there. Really glad! Sir, if we go a little forward, there's a short-cut on the right. We can walk that way. You shut up! You made us 5-6 kms saying that they are short cuts. Let us go with a guess. Son, let's ask around and go. - You could catch the thief because of me! All policemen are like this only! Once their job is done, they don't care about us. Dude, please adjust. - Hey! Let's go. If we had time, we'd only be happy to come to the police station. When people like you come to the station, we'll also be happy. Yes, sir. It's in Paramedu station limit only. The car number is KL 13 K 4896. Yes, sir. I'll come to the station & file a complaint. There's a small function in my house in the morning. I'll come as soon as it's over. Yes, sir. It got stuck on to Chackochayan's foot. The police was at the junction all this while. They just left sometime back. Chackochayan, this is a part of a bubble gum. See! From this we can be sure that the thieves spit it out. It's sure. I really doubt the policeman and the guy who came to shit. What do I do now? There is one way. Look! From the spit particles in the bubble gum, you'll get his DNA. Then we can catch the thief using Aadhaar. Get lost, Vasuetta. As if Aadhaar is linked with spit! What about the bus ticket, chilli powder and movie tickets. These are evidences that have existed for a long time. But spit and bubble gum are not like that. Isn't that true? Do one thing, Chackochayan. Don't let the spit on the bubble gum dry up, being exposed to the wind. We'll give this to the police when they come. What say? Keep it with you. The yam I had brought from my brother's house, was in the boot. I couldn't even cook a dish with it. And that orchid I bought from the nursery? The thieves plucked its flower too. There were bananas, yam, jack fruits and what not! So you didn't see the thieves yesterday? No, Chechi. Mom didn't let me come out when they came. What do I say! I had seen that man. But he doesn't look like a thief. He came because he badly wanted to shit. The entire town is here. - True. What happened, Chackochetta? Say it without hesitation, Chackochayan. My dear Michael, when I went to get the newspaper from the gate, I didn't find it. When I turned around, the car was also missing from the shed. How will you get the newspaper? Sunny's bike was stolen by the thief, newspapers included. I have to go and report that after this. Chackochetta, it must be them who took your car as well. Give it. Chetta, didn't you see it? Sticker! Sticker? - Yes. Haven't you been following the news? The video of your car being taken away, is up on Kerala Police's page. Look! It's our car. Look! - I saw it. Michael... There's some foul play in this. You ran because you saw a snake. Fine! But why were you sitting in that jungle at dawn, wearing a mask? Sir, he must have gone there to see the snake. Him & his over humility! I told even my boys to learn from him, sir. - We'd have gone wayward. What are you looking with those round eyes for? Answer his questions, you thief! A gentleman like you shouldn't intervene in such shady cases. Policemen have their own techniques. Let them do it. He needn't say it. Let us reach the station. Shibu sir has some techniques! With that, he'll confess all the crimes he has done so far, and the ones he's planning to do in the future too! Don't mind us sitting here. You can start the interrogation from here itself. Gentlemen can't leave anything safely now. That's true, sir. Sir, we went there to stick a sticker. We? Who's the other guy? Me and Thakkudu. - Thakkudu? Yes. Thakkudu. I don't remember his original name. You don't have to remember. When you reach the station, Shibu sir will rip you apart. Sir was looking for a healthy prey! Shibu sir is calling. He'll have a long life. Ashraf, we've left from there, after the tea distribution. And yeah, a car has been stolen from some house over there. From what I heard, it must be the house where you went to defecate. Oh no! Sir, they were quite irresponsible. Their car's boot was open. I closed it myself. It was full of yam and bananas. What will happen to all of that? Let that be. You're in that area anyway, right? Just go and check. Note down the car's number. Okay sir. Do you have a pen? - Pen? Here's a blue pen. I'll say a number. Write it down. Say it, sir. Yes... KL... Thirteen... K? K for Kallan (thief). Forty eight... Ninety six. Tata Manza. Tata Manza. Okay, sir. Okay. The house that you went to shit in? Someone stole their car. Oh no! They were such nice people! Who would have stolen their car, sir? It must be him only. Me? - He has all the looks of a car thief. Look at his crooked face! It's not me. - That's true. And he doesn't have dignity as well. No aesthetics too. Where's all that? Sir, I haven't taken all those things they said. I don't even know what they are. I forgot to tell Shibu sir that we caught him, in between all this. Go fast. - Okay. Speed up! I'm speeding. - Hey! Mahesh! I was running around. That's why I couldn't call. I'm not late, right? Okay. I will call you. Rocking? Shall I pick up this phone? - Sure, sir. Yes. Got the item! We're on our way. We got a little late. We'll reach now. By evening! It's my business partner. Is it? What's your business, sir? Automobile spare parts. It's a family business. Oh okay! Sir, it's good to install a CCTV camera in your office. Okay. We can install a couple of them. Thanks. 'I asked for only one flower, you gave me a spring season' You reached? Your phone rang so many times. It will ring. I went running, after triggering it! Haven't the kids woken up? They woke up in the morning and are watching the kids' channel. Let them watch the kids' channel. They are our angels, right? You also watch it for some time if you want to. Okay? Get me a strong tea. Make it a black tea. I don't need milk today. 'O guardian angels' 'Don't wink' Oh my God! So many missed calls? I think 'One life for one tea' scheme has hit the bumper! We might have to celebrate 100 days of it. 4 missed calls from SP sir? I'll call him first then. What the hell have you done? 'One life for one tea' scheme. Your scheme is to treat thieves, giving them tea? I don't understand anything. Aren't you living in this world? Sir, I had gone running! Bloody runner! The news is running on every channel! Take immediate action. You have time till I reach my desk. Your damn 'One life for one tea' scheme, and a 'Flower offering for the police'! What happened now? These are times when people who made black tea, have reached great positions. Enough of your kids' channel. Take these little devils away! - Mommy! The thieves stole PT Chacko's car with the number, Kl 13 K 4896. The thieves who were escaping with the car, were given a grand farewell, by treating them with tea, under the leadership of the local SI Shibu KT. The thieves who stole the extremely rare species of Orchid flower, which is facing extinction, grown in Chacko's house, handed it over to SI Shibu, and that's clear in the video. This points fingers to the fact that the policemen already knew the thieves, and had a pre-planned agreement with them. The appearance of the video of serving the thieves, on Kerala Police's official page, increases the impact of the disgrace. Meanwhile, the black sticker appearing on the wall of the same house, strengthens the doubts that this is organized and collaborative. With Cholappuzha custody death, SP's daughter's attack against the constable, and other police brutalities, Kerala Police and the home ministry who are already disgraced, and this incident is the latest chapter of their misdeeds. This family is still in the shock of losing their dearest car. From Paramedu, for Unlimited Vision, with camera man Michael sir, Ashwathy Ramachandran. Will my cap stay here anymore? I have decided one thing. I'll never drink black tea at dawn again. Don't take such harsh decisions, Samyukthan. Kerala Police was able to catch this thief, because you felt like defecating, right? That's right. - Everything happens for a reason! We might even catch more thieves, sir. The car thieves are still out there! That's true. We have to catch them too. That's my car. - Oh! That's the one? Hey! Stop near that car. Hey! Turn the car around so that it would be easier for them to get out. Even though we travelled only for a short while, we became really close. Hey! Turn to the right! Sunny from the press, hold him as soon as we step out. He might try to escape. True, sir. Look at him sitting! Thief! Forward. Stop on the left. Okay, sir. So we've reached our destination. Sir, Spyers security camera. Don't forget. Sure! It's our necessity, right? Come! Sunny, hold him tight. - So glad to have met you. He's a great runner. - Don't forget my name. Ashraf Khan. We'd like to come along & help you catch the car thieves. But it's their PSC exam. Boys! - Sir. Write only what you know during the exam. Don't take wild guesses. - No. They won't even write what they know. That's how we've raised them. The way you came... - Sir. 4896! 4896! Catch them! Sir, it's the car Shibu sir told you about. Catch them! Catch them! You crook! - Bro, let go! Let go of his hand! [indistinct arguments] Let's go! Let's go! - Stop the car! Start your car! Start the car, Samyukthan! Get in, fast! Turn it around! Hold tight! - Chase them! Make it fast, sir. - Stop going round & go fast! Since you told us to give everyone a homely feel, we didn't ask much, sir. Why did you receive that flower with your hand? Don't you know that policemen are not supposed to accept gifts? I accepted it when they gave it with so much love, sir. What about a bubble gum that someone spit out, which the reporter said? Our station's PC Ashraf has gone there, sir. And then? - I'm not able to get through to him. Why? - I think his phone is switched off. Stop blabbering and go there personally. If we don't catch them before the SP reaches his office, all of us will be suspended. Can you ask the SP to reach the office late, then? If my calculation is right, they would have crossed Karnataka border now, sir. From there, straight to HD Kote, and then Antharasanthe. What Santhe? - Antharasanthe. That's where they break cars into pieces. Shall I go there, sir? First you go to the house where the car was stolen from. Let me deploy maximum forces. Update me, on everything that happens. Go fast! - I'm going fast! This road is not wide at all. Why do you need width? Only one car has to go, right? Go fast! They are right behind! Put the left indicator & turn right! Yes! Put the left indicator & turn right! Not the light! Indicator! Will the public be furious, Lawrence? - No. They are stronger in number. That's what we don't have. Anyway, it won't be as much as we got from the DYSP. - Is it? Of course. Ask them, sir. Who is Chacko among you? Sir, I am Chacko. - I didn't ask you. Sir, he is Chacko. We saw him on TV, right? It's him! - This is him! Come here. I had seen you. You came on TV, right? Are you happy? - Yes. What happened? Sir, when I went to the gate to get the newspaper, I didn't see it there. When I looked back at the shed, the car was also missing. That's what happened. I had seen everything on TV. Bring it. Prathapan! Bring it. Give it. That's our flower. Did you see? That's right. Since we put it in water, it won't decay for 2 days. Unlike what you said on TV, we have nothing to do with them. Hold it. - Take it. Keep it inside, brother. Sir, it was all Michael & that girl's doing. I didn't know anything. Everyone is trying to attack me deliberately, sir. Poor fellow. There are stickers on my wall as well. Stickers? - Yes. Black stickers? Yes, sir. Black. Sir, help me somehow. According to all the circumstantial evidence we've got so far, the culprits began their journey on a KSRTC bus from Pathanapuram in July 2017, and have watched the movie 'Captain' from Kunnamkulam, in February 2018. How can they see it, sir? - Buying tickets! These tickets are proof! If so, would they have started from Pathanapuram 6 months back, to watch this movie? Lawrence, don't keep interrupting my intelligence. Even though they are culprits, they are Indian citizens with the freedom to travel. They are still continuing the crimes they started from there. These stickers are proof to that. Did you notice this packet of chilli powder? - Yes. What do you feel, seeing this packet without a name or address? This was made from a cottage industry. If that's the case, the culprit might be working in the movies, or a bus employee, or he could even be part of a cottage industry. - Bubble gum! Hey! I forgot to give the bubble gum to sir. Bring it. I'll bring it now. I had forgotten. Oh! Is that there? Then bring it. Give it to sir. The rule is that I shouldn't accept any gifts. Thank you. Do you want half, Lawrence? - No, sir. Thank you. Sir, don't eat it. The thief chewed and spit it out. Samyukthan, keep the car right behind them. Or they'll stop it and run away! Speed up, sir. No problem even if you crash on to him! You'll be thrashed soon. You wait. Bro, we have a plan B if the police catches us, right? First try not to get caught. There's still a lot of time to learn plan B. Sir, they are going so fast. They know how to drive! You know to run, right? Why don't you run & catch them? Speed up! Mahesh! Chilanka travels will try to chase us today as well. Don't let them. Let's see. Oh! You're leaving? There are 2 more minutes. What 2 minutes? Who's going to come now? Get in, man! Hope we reach first. Oh no! They've got a lead. Samyukthan, stomp the accelerator! Sir, let's see how far they would go! I started with full tank petrol from Ernakulam. You didn't push it after filling it up. You drove it, right? Sir, check the metre gauge. It's got great mileage. How much do you get, sir? Around 20-21. If mileage is high, power will be low. That's why we can't catch them. Sir, stop reviewing the car and speed up! They've crossed that turning. I'll catch them now! Why did you slow down? Bro, I can't see them now. Speed up, you fool. Are you driving to show others? This is a chase! O Mother Mary! If you save us from this death trap, I'll bring both of them to Velankanni & shave off their heads. So you won't shave? I did it when you fell sick during childhood. Speed up, man! - Okay. Fly it! - Is this a kite? I had told you! If this was an Audi, we'd have reached our destination by now. isn't this chase enough? Audi, it seems! Go on! Go! Go! You drive quite fast while playing that game, right? Oh crap! Bro, there's a bus in front of us. It's not letting us go. - Oh no! KSRTC! Fast! - Switch on the light! They'll make way thinking it's a hospital case. Keep honking! If this was an Audi... - If it was an Audi? Shut up! I'll stuff something in your mouth! Mahesh! Someone who couldn't get in, is following us in a car. Stop! Oh no! Is this how you brake? Bro, they've stopped the bus in the middle of the road. What do we do now? Hey! Someone like our brother! Sorry sir. We left 2 minutes early. We thought no one would come. - That's okay. I'm used to running. - Where to? Where to? - Where to? This bus goes to Kottarakkara. - That's fine. Give me a ticket. They have reached here. Stop, sir! Stop! Stop! Stop! - I'm also coming. Catch him! Catch him! Don't catch me. - Sir, the guy got on the bus. Run & catch him! Bro, come to the station with a lawyer. When we take them to Th station, there will be 2 cases, right? Move away. You're a traitor, lil' bro. So you don't have a problem with our bro taking the bus? He must have gone to call a lawyer. Keep on waiting! - Hey! Hey! Shut up! Enough of your family talks! You heard me? - That's what! They made me a thief because I just took a bike to escape. Get lost. Samyukthan, tell them whatever you want to say. - No, sir. Hit them if you want to. You can do it only now. No need, sir. They would come out some day, right? They would. We can't do anything about it. That's what. - Wait & watch, Samyukthan. Why did you get late? Set it up quickly. Come fast. Michael, these are the thieves. Focus on them properly. Sir, the journalists have come. To take our bytes. You also cover your face. They will be shooting you also. Oh no, sir! Don't put me along with these thieves. No! I'll salute you! One slap I'll give you! You're the one who made us run first. You're lucky that I'm not in the police. The police have captured the culprits of the car theft case, who have been troubling Kerala Police since morning. Police constable Ashraf who led the operation is joining us now. Sir, can you elaborate about the incident for our viewers? I am Paramedu police station constable Ashraf. This is Samyukthan. It was the both of us who risked our lives, to capture this international car theft mafia. We've cast nets across Kerala to the culprits who have escaped. We've invited more members from the force, and senior police officers here. Sir, it's Shibu sir. Sir, he's blowing his trumpet in front of the media. Beware of him! Sir, are you the SI or him? - What do you think? By the way he's talking... I also felt so. - I was about to say that. Then why didn't you say it? - Suku! Look at Shibu sir's stylish entry. Must be to congratulate us. Namaste, sir. Are you relieved now? - Yes. That smile says everything! What are you doing here, giving these culprits to the people? Sir, I was explaining to the media. That's not necessary. They will twist it. You gave that news in the morning, right? Yes. Why? Nothing. That's not right, okay? Lift your cloth! No! Lift your mask! It was you? - Yes. You will steal from my station limits? No, sir. I... After drinking tea from me, you bit me back, huh? You could write the PSC exam since you left early, right? We couldn't write it, sir. We were caught before that. So what? Now you can write all the alphabets with your noses, on the ground! Lawrence, bring them to the station immediately. The car that the thieves brought. Is it in driving condition? Ashraf, can we drive it? - Yes, sir. They drove it all the way here. Then it's fine, sir. - Mr. Samyukthan... You will also have to come to the station. Oh no, sir! I have an urgent appointment. Does he have only appointments and defecation? We'll leave you in 10 minutes. Is there any information about the thief who escaped on the bus? Sir, I've cast a net to catch him! Who are you to cast a net? A fisherman? Well, someone has gone behind him to catch him. Very good. Before DYSP Ashok Kumar sir reaches the station, we should take them there. Rest, at the station! Oh no! My purse is missing. It was in my bag! My purse! Please look for it. We will search. Wait. - Please, brother. Mahesh, no one has alighted the bus. Take the bus to the station. Who knows whether they are part of a smuggling mafia! Didn't you search the car? I searched a little bit, sir. - What are you doing? Go search! Move your butt! Ashraf, continue. Sir, we were chasing them... Oh no! Nothing has happened to the bananas and the yam. Take him out. - Should I tell you specially? Get out, I say! Get out. - I'll get out myself. Take off your mask! Hi, officers. How are you? - Hi. Fine. All of you are here? It's so hot, right? Samyukthan! What a pleasant surprise! Jack Daniels? You? Here? - How's the business going there? Business.... Sir, this is Thakkudu. - Is this Thakkudu? Yes. Thakkudu. Do you know him? - Sir, he is Jack Daniels. He is Spyers company's employee of the month. Yes, officer. Employee of the month! Why is the bus coming here? Did they mistake it for the bus station? Isn't this that bus? - Mahesh, stop! Sir, there's a thief in the bus. He stole a lady's purse. We're coming straight to the station. I haven't allowed anyone to get out. - Shibu, go & check. Ashraf, go & check. Ask only the thief to come. Let the others stay inside. My Aadhaar card, my voter's ID... Calm down, sister. We've reached the station, right? Nice. I had parked the car near the bus stop. We got it. And, I didn't steal that purse. Don't let him go. Catch him. - Come. Is Shibu sir here? - Yes. Everyone is here. You can have one more tea. - Sir, he hasn't paid for the ticket. Sir, when Ashraf sir & I were coming in the car, they asked for a lift. Both of you? - Yes, Ashraf sir too. So they asked for a lift, and Ashraf sir went to them as soon as we stopped. Shall we start? If you say everything without missing any detail, it would be good for both of us. Start. - It's all their plan, sir. I don't know anything. - Don't say so! I'll say it, sir. I am an elder brother with a lot of problems, sir. These poor brothers of mine, who have flunked around 50 exams... When they stay up during night to study, for a slight entertainment. I had planned to buy a home theatre & a playstation, sir. So you guys have done a lot of planning? That's how our father has raised us, sir. This is the first incident in our lives. What? Theft? No. Getting caught by the police. With this, we'll lose all the goodwill that our father had earned, sir. What was his job? He was a very popular Robin Hood in our town, sir. That means? - Like Kayamkulam Kochunni, he steals from the rich & gives it to the poor. What was your father's name? Panjimoottil Mathayi, sir. Will you get the money to buy a home theatre if you sell a Tata Manza? We had planned to start with this. It's said that many drops make an ocean, right? So this was the beginning of a series of robberies? Nothing like that. - What's your name? Rafael. - Rafael? So your name must be Bofors, right? Mikhayel! Remand them. - Okay. Where are those sticker guys? - They are outside. Call them. - Lawrence, bring them in. Come in. - Hey man! - Man? Walk! - Hi officer. How are you? Fine. Thanks. What's your name? - I'm Jack. Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels? - Yes. For your antics, only a shady rum's name would suit you. What about you? - Sahachari. (Companion) I understood that you're his companion. Tell me your name. That's my name, sir. Sujith Sahachari. Were you the ones who stuck it everywhere? - Yes, officer. We stuck everywhere that came on the papers. There are some more places yet to come on the papers. Sir, I haven't stuck it anywhere. I only lifted Thakkudu. I can stick it only if someone lifts me, right? So actually we are partners in crime. Right, officer? So you know everything. - Of course. Since they have confessed the crime, before the media comes, give some money & send that blanket guy back to his home town Okay, sir. - I'll give you the required amount. Thank you, sir. I have given my statement. If there's any emergency, just let me know. Sir, I have an appointment. Shall I? - Why not? You may leave, Samyukthan. Thank you, sir. There's one more small job left. Can you please wait outside? Okay sir. - Samyukthan! This Central Kerala is a market with a lot of potential. We'll sit & discuss. Let it be the right time. So carry on. We'll meet at the next review meeting in Kochi. Go ahead! Okay, Jack. - Okay. The group that scared people by sticking stickers has been caught. The group that stuck stickers on walls & windows of house in Kannur & Kozhikode, and made people panic, has been arrested by the police. Jack Daniels & Sahachari who hail from Kozhikode, were arrested. They spread panic by sticking stickers on walls of different houses, to sell camera to people for overcoming that panic. That was their technique. To establish that someone taller than them did the crime, both of them used stones and ropes, and stuck stickers at the same height from the floor. Hey! We are late. It's said that 'First impression is the best impression'. Will we be in trouble? You & your first impression. It doesn't matter when you reach! Don't say that. - Then what? I'm fed up of coming with you. Look for some other guy. To other news... The thieves who troubled the police since dawn at Kannur Koothuparamba, were caught. Mom! Here's the news of our missing car. How come they haven't reached yet? Is it them? Is this the house? - Dude, this won't work. What's wrong with this house? You create such troubles whenever you see any house. It's not that. - Not what? Drive forward. Take it inside. Kerala Police has nabbed a criminal group which might have inter-state ties. Within hours of the theft, the culprits were caught with the stolen items in hand. These men on my left and right. One is constable Ashraf. And then, Samyukthan. It was their brave actions, that helped us in catching these criminals. Samyukthan is not a policeman. But... Kerala Police needs such brave young men like Samyukthan today. It's them. That's Mahesh. We're not late, right? - No! No! Please come inside. Come. Come on, man. Sayoo... - Samyukthan. Namaste. Please sit down. Please come. Sit down. - Slowly! Slowly! Is this the groom you told us about? - Yes, it's him. I had shown you an old photo that day. Back then, he had a dignified look. He is a great guy. He works in sales, right? With all the mist & the rain, he lost all his glamour. He's a sweet guy. Then shall we? Hey! Brother, it's the same guy. Look. Devaki, call our daughter.
