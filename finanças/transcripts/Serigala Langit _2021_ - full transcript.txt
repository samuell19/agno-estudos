It's impossible not to think about that, Nadia! How do you not think about that? How!? It's so frustrating! You fly often. It will be easy for you, right! Which part is easy? You always say like this. Every time we talk, you never gave me a solution. Because you always think, it's all that easy, easy and easy! It's not that easy, Nadia! As you know. Sorry, my bad.

Amen. He has gone to a better place. Sure, Uncle. Mom. You're still awake? Do you know a strory about this necklace? The first time you played paragliding with your uncle Panji. At that moment, your father tried to bring you home. At the same time he couldn't. But I could bring you home, and he gave me this. Enough, Mom. He wasn't worth enough to keep in mind. He has left us. No matter how hard you fool yourself. The hatred will separate us, if we don't let it go. You had your father, but now he passed away. And way before he died, he abandoned us! He stopped being my husband, but he never stopped being your father. You always assumed you stopped being his son. I want you to keep this neckless. Then you can always remember, how special he was. Forgive him. Don't hold grudges. - Jupiter flight check in. - Jupiter two, three, four. Jupiter flight box formation, box formation, go. In here. We are taught to suppress our emotions, Nad. You can see. Everything is organised. Strictly regulated. Neat. Can't do anything as you want. Ruslan, you too close, to the plane in front of you. No, it was correct. It can be seen here, that you are too close. Just shut up. Off first. How is it supposed to be? Ruslan has been wrong twice. His plane was too close to mine. It's called a formation. The point is to be close. Stop. - Ruslan. - Yes, Sir! Your positioning is wrong, you are too close! - Ajeng, explain it properly. - Yes, Sir! Ruslan's plane should be 1 plane away from the plane in front of it. Nice, that's correct. But I don't know why lately I feel like I was slowly ruin everything that I had. I've been in that situation many time. Life is just like that, right? Want to keep it, want to be hung. Some difficulties always exist. That is a complement to life. But, it depend on us, get up and reorganize life again. Just like that one. Neat. Commander! - Gadhing Baskara. - Yogi Hartanto. How are you, bro? - I'm fine, and how are you, bro? - I'm good.

Let me introduce you, this is Nadia. - Nadia. - Yogi. Is your wife? - She is a friend. - No, we're not together. Yeah, I hope you two always be friends. THE KABUBED REPUBLIC It is dangerous to let her gain so much data on us! If you want to stay and live here, you have to finish her. I'm telling you, Mr. Rudi. What I have said when you first contacted me was the terms of our agreement with you. So, it's non negotiable. It's 20 million dollars. You will be getting additional support coming your way is all I can tell you when I've already know the level of the difficulty. No more tomorrow. Sorry to say. If you don't like my deal, I will take my business elsewhere. Well, how do I know that you can be trusted? Trust is expensive. So, you better trust me. Because I also can only trust in those who can give me what I want. So, the question is are you trustworthy? OUTER ISLAND OF INDONESIA - Boss. - Hello, boss. You seem very eager to see me, Sir? - Just like this, Sir. - Call, Boss Man! I mean Boss Man. As we talked it yesterday, I come here to represented my boss, who happened to be unavailable because he has to attand some bussines... Mr. Rudi. I'll get confused. When I hear someone talking nonsense. What you mean, You want to tell me that you and your boss have a job for us. - That's is right, Boss Man. - This is what I hate about. An alliance should be based on mutual respect. It's a symbiosis mutualism. But not only for someone who has money or resources. - That was too feudalist. - What I meant here is... Don't think that we here needed a job. - No. not at all... - Get it through you head. You need us who live in this village! Just get to the point. What can you do for my people? This's whats called cooperation. - What's the problem? - Okay. He is my ears, my eyes, my leg and my left hand. I have some data, that this girl is here. For that reason, we need you to finish her. Because if she leaves this country. We be devastated! And we couldn't be able to help your people, Boss Man! Sir, you already understand about symbiosis mutualism. Hi, Gad. Since when you called me Gad? I feel uncomfortable with God, Nadia. This because you don't like being called "Dhing". When I called you Dhing, you will said "Do you think I am cruel?!". Now I called you, "Gad", it's also wrong. Okay fine! I'll go home. Going home? What do you mean? Why don't you open your window. Hurry up! In a front? Hi.. Why you here? Let's go out, I'm starving! - Why don't you come in first? - If I go in, I'll see uncle Panji. If I see uncle Panji, at this hours, It's not polite, Nadia. Come on. Hurry up! Let's go! I'll count backward, okay! - 30 seconds, okay! - Alright, just a second. Okay. - Do you want sugar or not? - Just a little bit. Just a little bit. - Gadhing, how are you? - Oh my God, Mrs. Hari. - How are you, Mrs. Hari? - I'm fine thank you. - How about Mr. Hari? - Mr. Hari fine, thank you. - Long time no see, right? - Yes, that's right. - For how long? - Too long, the last time.

Dhing, Is this really Indonesian Air Force's twitter? Yes, that right! See, it verified. This is really Indonesian Air Force's Twitter. Why, is it because of the language? Just like joking around? That is on purpose. So that there is no boundries with the society, and their followers. Like Indonesian Air Force motto, Faraway in the sky, but still close to the heart. I wasn't the only me who starving. Why are you so quite? I want to talk to you but I'm afraid you're getting upset. What is it? What? About what?? I'm starting to pissed off, so what? Nothing, I just want to say later when you are already on duty, don't forget to your mother. Yes, Ma'am! Anything else? while it's free? I happen to be willing to listen It well. No, that's all. Enough for your attention it will expire if too much. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Nad. - Yes. - Tomorrow, I'll drive you? - Where are we going? You'll know, just go inside! - Gadhing! - Uncle. Come here, let me introduce you. He is your senior too. Okay. He is... - Fajar. - Gadhing. He was known by his fellow officers as "The Legend". Every time he appeared in the sky When playing dogfight all opponents would run away. Everyone were scared. Because he was known as " The one and only Red Wolf " That was then with Panji, when we were still flying in the air force. - We are here now and we're flying. - Yes, Sir! Dhing, you have to try flying with paragliding. Because flying with paragliding, you can understand the nature. The wind and the hill. - You fling without an engine. - Yes, Sir. That'll make your feeling stronger. Try it! - Do you want to try it?? - Sure, Uncle. Nadia, Gadhing would like to fly, can you prepare another glider, - Let's go there. - Ask permission, Sir! - Use your feeling when you fly. - Yes, Sir. - You really want to fly? - Of course. - Fly alone? - Of course not. I'll fly with you. If your talking about flying an aeroplane then the best there is. But with this I need your help please, Senior! ♪ Maybe you want to be alone ♪ ♪ But alone is not for sure, You forget that I care ♪ ♪ I know that you want to run ♪ ♪ Further than this, but together we'll be even more ♪ ♪ Hold my hand ♪ ♪ Count 1,2,3 and close your eyes ♪ ♪ Imagine what we want is there ♪ Dhing, I want to teach you about one of the flying techniques. Which might help you later. This is called soaring. Soaring's one of the flying techniques that maintain altitude along the mountain ridge or big hill. To utilize the rising air created by the ridge to help you stay airborne. This one is very important That the pilot makes a change of direction during the soaring so, they don't fly near the hill, and avoid the risk of hitting the ridge. If you fly too close to the mountain then you should turn away from the ridge. And now, let's soar like an eagle. ♪ Count 1,2,3 and close your eyes ♪ ♪ Imagine what we want is there ♪ From the first, every body know. I also knew. That Uncle Panji was one of the best pilotes. And the best instructors. But I just realised today, that his daughter, is just as good as her father. ♪ Count 1,2,3 and close your eyes ♪ Come on in, Sam. Please, have a sit. Well, Sam. I just got an order. That commander ask you, to standby on the west area. - You are Wingman Lion. - Yes, Sir. Around 17:00, we leave. And you will be transferred there for a week. Please, can you help me coordinate it. If you meet any resistance report it straight away. - Yes, Sir. - Okay, dismiss. Thank you. Gadhing.. Gadhing.. That's true what Rusdi used to say. What do you mean, Uncle? Well, your father told me once. That you're his little pilot one day going to be a hell of a pilot. The lord of the sky. The knight of the sky. Even when in the hospital he always talking about you. Always looking for you. Do you think my father hates me? As long as I know. In his ups and down your father. Always consistent about one thing. He always loves you. But I'm not a good son, Uncle. The important things is he trusted you. He always believes in you. One day you'll be a great person. That's what he thinks, Uncle. That's one of the clich's, I've heard over and over again. Now whether, do you believe in those words or not? It's not easy, Uncle. Nobody said, it was going to be easy for now. Believe that it will come true, it's called hope. And it was also your father's hope for you to. Herman: I'm waiting for you at Iswahjudi-madium air base. - Nad. - Yes. I have to go back to Madiun. Are you ready? I'm ready, Mom. No one knows what will happen in the future. On the other hand as we know, you've been through the worst thing in your life. Against the odds, whatever comes to your way. Thank you, Mom. Helen, what you have done has put our mission in a difficult situation. Now, I hold into this. Fine, take it than.
