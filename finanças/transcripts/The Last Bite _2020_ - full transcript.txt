Very necessary, very necessary... That is the solution, if we think about it. The solution is connection. It's understanding that we're more or less all the same. I think that. The more I expose myself to the world, the more I realize that. We're just... we're all the same. We're all just different points of view. ["Dream Piano" by F.M.] Because... society tells me what to do. So, I don't really have a choice. I don't believe that, I really don't. I believe... I believe I'm afraid. - Do you own the premises? - No, no I don't. - How you doin'? - Good... how are you? Ah, dealing with the same shit as usual. I haven't had time lately. So, are we ready to organize a mocap session? The actress is ready. Yeah, sure. Regarding the church scene, I really think we should change the colours to the green... ...and also: Some of these shots aren't worth the hassle. Maybe we can just...look... No, no, no. We keep the scene as it is. Yeah, sure. Ah, also, I just need you to take a look at... My love, how are you? Sure we can meet tomorrow. [ Background music ] So, let's see what you've been working on then. Oh, yeah. Son. I am not going to take you to training today. I am telling you so. ♪Foreign language♪ Today you are not going to training. I am not going to take you to training today. Stop playing. No training today. I am telling you. [ Mysterious music ] [ Coffee shop noises ] I was sleeping earlier that night. And then... The room was cold, the light was on. And I was in that state... ...where you are about to wake up but you are not really asleep. And that's when it got me. For the hundredth time. The paralysis. My body was gone. But I could see... My arms coming out of my arms. I could see as clear as the sky. But I could see... ...my arms, I had double. It's like I had another pair. Do you understand what I'm saying? They were shiny, so bright. I started screaming, but nothing came out. Nothing came out of my mouth, just a whisper. I kept screaming. Screamed so hard. No one could hear me. That's when I woke up. I was myself again, everything was gone. But for a brief moment... ...I tought I was dead. [ Eerie sounds ] [ Restaurant noises ] [ Park noises ] I'll be alone... I'll die alone. And it will be just like before I was born. A timeless timeline... made of fear and inevitability. I am trying to date... I really am. Not really. I just forget. [ City noises ] [ Eerie sound ] [ Dreams of Ghosts by F.M. ] So, how long have you been here? Two years. And before that? Used to share. - It sucks right? - Yeah. I bet Portugal is sunny in this period, isn't it? Well, yeah... it's... Yeah. Do you miss it? ...so... I understand very well. Yeah. So... What about you? What about me? Do you miss home? Yeah. Do you see this? My dad closed the car door on me when I was a little kid. Now it's still with me. I don't know how I got this, it just appeared. I am sorry. I can't, I am sorry. Don't do parting. You'll lose your hair. Just like me. Be aware of the person who nourishes the art. Of you. [ Shun Yin theme by F.M. ] Few nights ago I had a dream about a woman. I felt like I knew her but her face was chaning all the time. [ The Walk by F.M. ] [ The Walk by F.M. ] Listen, I had a look at scenes you just sent me. It is amazing. I love this character. I think you are going in the right direction. What you need is a little push. I think it might be luck, you know? My grandmother used to say: Luck is how the universe fixes things around you. Always remember this... I'll see you at the wrap party... wrap party... wrap party. I need to know her name. Please. Look, if you don' tell me I am going to kill myself. I swear to god, I'll do it. Veronica. Thank you. Cut, cut, cut. Veronica? ♪Foreign language♪ May I introduce myself? Please do. I've seen you. In your dreams? Yes, yes. I've just arrived in the city. Where are you from? ♪Indistinct chatter♪ I live closeby... if you want to... So this is your bubble? This is my workplace. What do you do? I am an artist. How's that going? Not bad. I mean, it could be better but it's not... Why don't you make it better? It's not really up to me, is it? Are you sure? Anyway, I am working on this movie right now. But honestly I feel like it's going nowhere. Work on something else then. I wish. I wanted to make a movie about 16 themes. But I only have these so far. It's just another commendement. There's no joy in the world. Consummerism. About 6 people. The small world paradox. And the porcupine dilemma. ♪Foreign language♪ I've told you son. You should leave this place. Find a better job. Marry a girl. Buy a house. ♪Foreign language♪ That's life. That's my life. That's your life. It will be your life. That's how society works. It always has and it always will be. Sons of feudalism. So, why did you move here... to this city? I am trying to find an answer to a very basic... ...yet complicated question. Kind of like... ...why is the alphabet in this particular order? I can't help you with that one. When was your last relationship? Long... long time ago... too long. You know... My only regret... ...is that I am not ordinary. I think that maybe if I were... ...things maybe would be different...you know? I am alone. Interesting people are always alone. So what about you? I have never had one. What do you mean? How's that even possible? I don't relate to people. Why? I had two brothers once. They were... very jelous of my strenght. Father didn't give me all the powers that I needed. You see... Love is always been taken away from me. I am talking about universal love. Undying love. We've created it many years ago. And it's still there. But it's very hard to grab. That is what you were searching for Carlos. Who are you? I'll show you. [ Second Contact by F.M. ] Did you say something? Well... They say: We are the universe experiencing itself. Explain that. Well. We are all part of the same thing. Studying and evolving into an introspective process. Yeah like a machine that understands its own dependency. Kind of... but it's more than that. It's a loop. It's a loop, isn't it? I am afraid it is. - You are part of it. - Yes. Can I kiss you? - It won't make a difference. - Why? We wanted to see you, with our very own eyes. You are a beautiful creature. One in a billion. But you're stuck in these times which are far too rough for you. What should I do? You've already done it. We've done this so many times before. You just can't remember. I am so sorry. I promise we'll make it better for you next time. We all spin around. We get intoxicated so we don't have to think about our death. And we meet different people everyday. We settle down and we have children, hoping that they will be better than us. But the virus has been spread. There is no cure for the disease. We always keep doing the same stuff all over again. Over and over again. And we live too many lives one after the other. We don't know which one is real. We all get to choose at the end. Deciding which one suits us best. And the last one is, not the best I guess. [ Slow It Down by F.M. ]
