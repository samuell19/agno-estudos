I've thought about it a lot, I feel ready to end my therapy. I know that it's a difficult decision. I've given it careful consideration and I've come to the conclusion that I'm totally fulfilled in my new life. Tell me more about it. I feel happy, more cheerful... I like my new job, I absolutely love it, really. In fact if I was offered a better paid job in a supposedly more prestigious magazine, I'd simply turn it down. And what about your friend? Again, things are so much better. It goes hand in hand. I'm happier at work, so I'm happier in my relationship. For a start, we argue far less, or at least I don't shout at him as much. I really feel that we both try a lot harder. For instance, I've just agreed to go on a trip to Jordan, which isn't really a place I would have chosen. But I want to go with him, it doesn't feel like a chore. All right, he's still adamant he doesn't want to have children, but I've got used to the idea. It's other people... If they can't see that you can love each other without having children, it's their problem. But you felt you were lagging behind because your younger sister has a daughter. I don't compare myself to her, any more. I have an excellent relationship with Jeanne, now. Doctor, during our first session, you said to me "Happiness is something you experience and you feel, not something you analyse and you explain." Well, today, thanks to you, I'm sure... I do feel this happiness. Excellent double page. This would have made a good cover. We said it was too much like last month's, if you remember. The guy who threw his pregnant wife out of the window. Ah, OK. Really catchy, this, great. We need a much softer focus on him. He's not blurred enough, we'll be sued. I'll have a set menu D with two beef and cheese kebabs. And for afters, some coconut balls, please. Goodness, look who's here! Sorry, girls, you're having lunch without me. HE DISPOSED OF HIS WIFE'S BODY IN A WICKER BASKET - Off we go, you bad lot! - Yeah! Granddad and grandma will be thrilled. This is not on! Is this how you're planning to spend the summer? I couldn't even leave a message, your voicemail is full. Your keys were in the lock. Do you want someone to slit your throat? - You're coming on holiday with us. - How do you mean? Say thank you to Wilfried, he sorted it out. Come on, hurry up! You might as well sleep in the sunshine. What if I don't want to go? Don't argue, Pauline! Can't the press come up with something new? She's everywhere, I only appear in the TV guide. It's not as if the series isn't going well. I've not told you, we're doing a new one, the shooting starts mid-September. Be discreet, I've been spotted. It will be worse in Italy. It's been broadcast for a year, it's a real hit. I used to go there incognito, now, I'm a bit worried. - Look, you're in this one. - Show me. I don't believe it. An inset photo in a crossword, it's worse than a TV guide. I wonder who makes these decisions. In your magazine, who chooses the photos for the crosswords? We don't do crosswords. Who would we have, Hannibal Lecter, Tom Ripley? I'll talk to my agent about this. A beautiful place by the sea, so I'm told. South of Genoa, in a little resort, the name of which escapes me. Yes, in theory, for two weeks. I have to go, Armelle, I'll call you back. You're very kind. Speak soon. It's not mine. Mine has a little red ribbon on the handle. Wilfried! What about the taxi? I don't want to queue up. I've booked one, it's fine. I've a feeling after this holiday, I'll need a break. It's a beautiful country. I'm a bit sad Lucie didn't come with us. It won't be quite so sunny, in England. Your daughter's not bothered, exchanges are for pulling and getting drunk. Do you mind, she's only 12. What's going on? What did the policemen want? There have been three homicides, they are looking for the... The murderer! - The murderer. - Who were the three victims? The people who got killed? Can't you see he doesn't understand? - What's the matter? - I know you. Your brain's buzzing with ideas, you've already got a title. Just so it's clear, you're here to have a rest. Wilfried's paid a packet for you to come with us. No more murders, psychopaths, frozen babies, forget this crap. - I'm not the one... - Give it a rest. We want to have a holiday as well, OK? What is it, now? - Good evening. - May I have your names, please? The Fayard family, and Miss Pauline Astruc. Is Mr Dominique around? He can't be very far, do you want me to call him? No need to bother him. We'll see each other sooner or later. He could have tried. Been here before? This is our third visit. But what about you, are you new? - I am. - Giovanna, am I right? Yes, Giovanna, that's it. I've been here since the middle of June. May I have your credit card, please? For the extras. Good evening. Here we go, the star system... Would you mind taking a photo of us? Er, yes, of course. Right, then, your keys... - This one is yours. - Thank you. - And here's yours. - Thanks. Third floor, second floor. Unfortunately, we've just closed our dining room, but room service can get you something any time. Wonderful. - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. Miss Astruc, your room mate may be asleep... My what? Your room mate, Miss Blanchot. She's French, like you. We didn't tell you, but as it was a bit last minute, there were no vacancies. Jeanne! You said I'd have my own room. Calm down! Indeed, I said you'd have a room. But you didn't specify I'd share it with a stranger. It's a suite, it's very spacious. And we were lucky to be offered this solution. Forgive me for butting in, but it's only for one night. People will be leaving tomorrow, you'll have a room around 2pm. - Shall we come with you? - I'll be fine, thanks. - Good night. - Good night, Pauline! She'll be all right. - Press the button. - I already have. - Good evening. - Good evening. I was waiting for you to go to sleep. - Good journey? - Very good, thank you. I say, this Fabrice must be a right idiot. What was he thinking about, leaving such a pretty girl? You know his name, you've been well informed. I had to know a bit about you, I'm not one to share my room with just anybody. Mariette Blanchot, nice to meet you. Pauline Astruc. - Cigarillo? - No, thank you. Mr Dominique, the hotel manager, came to talk to me about it. He was very embarrassed, he knows I come here for peace and quiet. I need it to write. Oh, are you an author? So to speak. Let's just say I write novels to kill time. Not a single publisher has ever been interested. Anyway, I like it here, it inspires me. As long as I'm alone, of course. I must admit that up till now, even the maid wasn't to disturb me under any circumstances. But Mr Dominique told me it was for one night only, and that you were in a very difficult situation. I've always been supportive to women who fight to make a success of their lives. Even if they fail. Your sister was the one who persuaded me. She said she was an actress, actually but I confess I'd never heard of her. But let's get back to you. How come you didn't see it coming? - Did you not suspect anything? - No. Unbelievable. I should think it's hard to get over it. Are you planning on turning this into your next novel? They will have told you that I'm on holiday with my sister to put all this behind me. Indeed, but I didn't know it was taboo. Not taboo, but there was no need to serve it up to just anybody. "To just anybody?" Remember that without me, you would have slept on a put-me-up with your sister and her husband. And it gives you a right to scrutinise my private life? SMOTHERED WITH A PILLOW FOR SNORING LOUDLY - Hi there, how did you sleep? - No comment. We thought we could ask Miss Blanchot for dinner, to say thank you. If you like, but don't count on me, I've done my bit. Did it not go well? She sounded nice, on the phone. She's sick and embittered, she never stopped prying. And why did you have to tell her I was dumped by Benoit Fouquenard, at school? Persuading her wasn't easy, I had to lay it on. But she still seemed nice to you? - Where's the cold milk? - Over there. Could you do us a favour? To reserve their sun loungers, people leave a towel on them. Could you get us three? No way, I'm not going to behave like these badly brought up people. Same thing last year, Wilfried went before breakfast or we didn't get one. Please. Excuse me? Don't leave your towels here, to come back four hours later. - Take them back, please. - Everyone else does it. But you're the one I've just caught. Sun loungers are not to be reserved. Remove all the towels, then. Why should I be the only one to follow the rules? I didn't see the others, but I'll say the same thing to them, when I do. You certainly know how to create a relaxed atmosphere for the holiday. I couldn't do it, I got told off by the guard. - But everyone does it. - I got told off for everyone. - Is Wilfried in bed? - He's playing golf. Could you bring me... No, it's OK, I'll go myself. By the way, look what I found, for you. If you don't want to take your beach bag everywhere, this is great, to carry the essentials. What, don't you like it? Can't you imagine me wearing this? Would you wear this? No, not me, I'm passionate about clothes. Whereas I dress really badly. It's great for people like you, you're always losing things. Your documents, I mean. Feel free to say my boyfriends, no worries. You don't want it, then. No, I'm not going to wear a waist bag. Things are not that bad, yet. Shit, don't tell me they're back. Back again? Hello! Maryvonne, Bernard, my sister, Pauline. - Hello. - Hello. We thought you'd be here last week. - Did you arrive last night? - Yes. I warn you, it's not a patch on last year. The new employees... Help! The bloke on the beach, Simone, he's a right thick head. - Must be the one who told you off. - Indeed. You see, really unpleasant. I'll talk to the management, if it carries on. The problem is, the clientele is not what it was. We come here because it's the only hotel, round here, advertised by a French tour operator. You can meet new people, and even have a natter with a star. - Yes... - What was I saying? For whatever reason, maybe new agreements, but the fact is the hotel is swarming with Russians. I must say, they're charming, but, you know... It's not what it was. - But the food is still superb. - Absolutely. We were in the catering business, and we think they are first class. Well, then... See you later, we're off to keep fit. Bye-bye! Paulinette... I wonder if I should get some photographers round. Excuse me? It would be good if there was an article about me. My holidays with Wilfried, my beloved sister. A series of supposedly stolen photos... Taken from a boat. Glamorous, but with a personal touch. Obviously, the press has to be interested. What do you think? I thought you'd come here to forget it all. In fact, you want to be seen. OK, forget it, you don't get it. What do you mean, then? Forget it, it's too complicated. You see, there was no need to get in early. Can I interest you in our water sports? Jet ski, banana boat... No, we're not at all interested. Who's this hot babe? He's the severely single-minded guy. He may be single-minded, but given his looks, he's completely forgiven. Can I help you? I'd like to know if my room is ready. I believe it is. Let's see... Room 208, on the same floor. A room completely to yourself. Do you need a porter to help you with your luggage? No, I'll be fine. Here's you key. Bring the other one back when you've moved rooms. - All right. - See you later. Don't mind me, I'm just passing. I'm taking my things and I'm off. You see, sharing wasn't that bad. True. Why don't you go out? The weather is so nice! I'm fine here. The sight of all these sagging bodies offends me. How do you wear this? Oh, I see, you tie it in the back. The things people wear! No sense of the ridiculous... Thank you! Well, then... All good things come to an end, we must go our separate ways. I wish you all the best. Bye! Can't you knock? And can't you hurry up? Wilfried's waiting downstairs. You don't want me to treat you like my daughter, but there's water everywhere. Is it so hard to hold on to the shower head? Would it be so hard to shut up? Impudent girl... Your curtains are purple. Isn't the guy from the beach super sexy? If I was you, I wouldn't hesitate. I've already told you, he's not my type at all. It's not fair, whenever I'm travelling on my own, all the men are ugly. Could you give me a hand, please? Every time, I think I'll make a dent in the contract, some good-looking kid will revive me... I end up alone in my hotel room, with the little chocolate on the pillow for company. Now that I have my sister and my husband with me, I finally see someone I fancy. At what time is my series on, here? I don't even know on which channel it's broadcast. Come here, I think they've caught the lecher! Sorted, no need to worry about it any more. - Shall we go? - Am I overdressed? - Not at all, you look great. - You've had my choc. No, I haven't. Come on, let's go. Party all night. It's all happening, you wouldn't believe it. What's the name of this Café, near Denfert ? It will come back to me. We had lunch there one day, after shopping. We got lots of reduced designer clothes. We ordered two menus of the day. My husband's here, you can ask him. Everything came from the wholesaler. The mushrooms à la Grecque, the pepper sauce on the burnt meat... It was highly rated in the Gault et Millau, and tutti quanti. Good evening, everyone. Have you had a good day ? Yes. Mr Dominique! - I'm so glad to see you. - So am I. You look radiant, Jeanne, your new hairstyle really suits you. Oh, here's the little one. Yes. Pauline, will you get up, please? Let me introduce you to Mr Dominique, - manager of the hotel. - Good evening. You really owe him. I did all I could to find a solution. I couldn't bear the thought of you being alone in Paris. Thank you. You'll meet lovely people, here. For the time being, I've only met married men. Though it doesn't stop some of them. Go to our disco, tonight, it's very lively. Excuse me, shall we go and eat? Absolutely, I'll come back to see you later. Enjoy your meal. If you want to get away, now's the time. - Excuse me? - I can tell you want to. It's these two, all they talk about is food. I feel full up already. Just go. I'll sort it out. Can you hand me over to your mum, sweetheart? No, I don't want to talk to Fabrice. Why are you talking about Fabrice? Is he with you? Armelle, what's your son on about, is Fabrice there? You're supposed to be my best friend, but you invited my ex on holiday? For the weekend, with his whore? Answer me! I was calling because I was tempted to come and join you! You know what? Go and look after your guests. Well? You just want to smash everything. Keep out of it, I'm not in the mood! Shit! Why aren't you at the beach? No sun loungers left. Did you sleep well? Like a log, why didn't you wake me up? I did come, but... She thought it was best to let you recover. Have you been sleeping since you left? No, I went to the night club, it was pathetic. By the way, I left my perfume at the old bat's. I knocked at her door but she was out. It's strange, she said she never went out. - At what time did you get back? - I don't know, late. - What's with all the questions? - Yes, leave her alone. I'm going to get myself an espresso at the bar. - Shall I get you something? - No, we're all right. Watch out! No broken bones? As if you cared, I heard you laughing. So, you're like a killer whale, you can hear under water. All right. Join us when you've calmed down. - Look, I'm really sorry. - You don't sound remotely sincere. From now on, you'll reserve my sun loungers every day. Ah, taking advantage. It's the least you can do, your chlorine's ruined my tunic. And what about my iPod? You're like me, you like Style Council. Well, this song, anyway. You're lucky, it seems to be working. Good, I'm pleased. Please excuse me, I must get back to the beach. By the way, I'm organising a water polo match. - Are you interested? - No. Thank you. - See you later. - OK. How silly of me! Excuse me, do you speak French? I stayed in Miss Blanchot's room, for one night. - Yes, I knew that. - Ah, did you? After I'd gone, I realised that I'd forgotten my perfume bottle. I went back, but the room looks empty. Indeed, Miss Blanchot left the hotel this morning. Just like that, on a whim? Fine... Did she leave my Shalimar bottle with you, by any chance? - Not as far as I know. - Good evening, Pauline. - Good evening. - Is there a problem? No, I was just surprised by Miss Blanchot's sudden departure. She had a call from Paris, she left in haste. - Any other questions? - No, thank you. Have you returned the key to room 210? No. Here it is. Thank you. Have a good evening, then. The same to you. I've reserved your three sun loungers. Thank you, but I'm going to the gym. My sister and her husband are out, but we might come later. Is this the way to the fitness room? All you have to do is read the signs. Mariette Blanchot, nice to meet you. - May I have a word? - Back from the gym, already? Yes. What's the little house at the back of the garden for? The shed? Well, it's a shed. I see. I know we've had our ups and downs. I've only seen the downs. It can change. It will change. You have to do me a favour, come closer. It may sound absurd, but I have a feeling things are being kept from me. I knew it, you think I'm mad. Not at all. - Things are being kept from you? - Yes. The first night I was here, I shared a suite with an old lady, Miss Blanchot, because there were no vacancies. The next day, I got another room, so I left Miss Blanchot's, but I forgot my perfume bottle in her bathroom. Tell me if I'm speaking too quickly for you. Since then, I tried to get it back, but I was told Miss Blanchot had left. I was a bit surprised, she would have told me. But she didn't, not a word about it. Maybe she didn't know she'd have to go. Exactly, maybe someone had a serious problem and she had to go back in a hurry. Though, frankly, who would ask this witch if they had a problem? But that's beside the point. You know that I wanted to go to the gym, this morning. But I never found the sign you kindly told me about, so I ended up at the shed, and guess what I saw? Miss Blanchot, gagged and tied to a chair. No, her luggage. All her belongings are stored amongst cardboard boxes. If she had to go... In a hurry. Yes, maybe she asked for her things to be sent to her later. - Have you asked at reception? - Yes, but Mr Dominique was there. Knowing him, I didn't ask, I don't trust him. He's quite capable of lying to me. OK, what do you want from me, exactly? I'd like you to ask him, He won't lie to you. - On one condition. - What, now? From now on, no more reserving sun loungers. If that's all it takes, it's a deal. I'll go and see him when I have my break. Thank you. My name's Pauline. I thought it was Paulinette. I heard your sister use this name. See you later, Simone, I'm just here, all right? Hello. Ah, hello. What lovely food will they be serving tonight? Let's see... The translation print is so small, I can't read it, without my glasses. What does it say? Bruschetta... With cherry tomatoes and smoked swordfish. It sounds good. Tell me, has your sister had lip enhancement? You don't have to answer, of course. And you, have you had buttock enlargement? You don't have to answer, of course. I'll leave you to dream about the menu. See you later. Simone! I'm late to give a lesson at the swimming pool, I must dash. Don't leave me high and dry, what did he say? I said that I went to the shed looking for parasols. But what did he say after that? - Are you the swimming instructor? - Yes. Can I leave my son with you? - Of course. - I'll pick him up at the end. - OK. - See you later. And? Not in front of him. Has something serious happened? Is she dead? - Stretch your arms, more. - Why did they not tell me? This is the height of the holiday season. If people found out, it would scare them off. Don't they even tell the staff? They were going to tell us at briefing. Very well, keep swimming up and down the pool. You'll have to be less cagey, why is her stuff in the shed? There's no one to send it to, she had no family. The police want her things to be kept. The police? This is neither the time nor the place to talk about it. I'll see you after work. I can't wait till then. Why was the police involved, wasn't it death by natural causes? They don't know, they're conducting an autopsy. She was found in her bed, but she'd had a blow on the head. Did she hurt herself before going to bed? A blow on the head? Meet me on the car park, at 9pm. She throws me out like a piece of dirt, and now, she refuses to get divorced. Right, there's news regarding our case. I bumped into Mr Dominique. He's very pleased because the autopsy revealed nothing. So, it was death by natural causes. - What about the blow on the head? - She must have banged into a door. You know full well it makes no sense. It suits Mr Dominique, the case is going to be closed. I think he's already let the room. He's lucky to have a Carabiniere friend. How do you mean? He's very close to a Senior Fiorentino, in charge of the investigation. I often see them on a boat, together. That's why the case was closed so quickly. He must have said that he didn't want to lose his clientele and that no one cared about her, dead or alive. It's still possible she really died of natural causes. The day before, she was in full health. She had not received any blows on the head. - Really? - Yes, really. A crime was committed, we have to find the murderer. What are you doing? - I have to go somewhere. - All right, I'm coming with you. Something isn't quite right. I still had the key to the room, he knew we'd shared for one night. Yet, no one asked to get it back or to talk to me. - I call this slapdash work. - I agree with you on this. - What's the matter? - Nothing. What were you saying? That the true question is whether we should think it was a crime. Of course, it was a crime, Simone! She was obnoxious enough for someone to want to kill her. And lonely enough for the deed not to have any consequences. On top of that, she was rich. Simone! What, now? It's about to start. The safe. What about the safe? There's a safe, downstairs, for our valuables. - And? - So much money is tempting, if you're just a receptionist, for instance. You spend all day behind a desk, and a really rich woman turns up. AN EXAMPLARY RECEPTIONIST? SHE KNOCKS A GUEST OUT TO ROB HER SAFE. Where's Giovanna? I've not seen her, today. She's having a few days off, she's not very well. A few days off, just as the old bat pops her clogs? Don't you think it's strange? She's not happy because Adrianna is away, again. It makes rehearsals difficult because the dance is for couples. Of course. Absolutely not! You'll see, it's very easy, just do what I do. Five, six, seven, eight! Giovanna and Mr Dominique were together, did you know? - Giovanna and Mr Dominique? - The plot thickens, doesn't it? Let's suppose he wanted to start a new life with Giovanna. - He owns a hotel. - No, not him, his wife. What? She's got the money, it all belongs to her. It makes sense. Mr Dominique falls for Giovanna, but his wife has all the money. He decides to kill a rich guest whom no one knows and who spends all her time in her room. The crime is passed off as death by natural causes, and they pocket the money in the safe. I'm a genius. Giovanna was working the night of the murder. Yes. Maybe she took a few days off to hide her loot. You said that Fiorentino had rushed the investigation and jumped to hasty conclusions. You must admit my version seems more logical. Giovanna could be opening a bank account, as we speak. Or maybe she's being sick in a bucket. Pauline... - Did you enjoy the Tarantella? - Very much so, it's very sporty. Young people used to spend all day doing this dance, because it was believed to cure you from the bite of tarantulas. - Hence the name. - Really? This is interesting. I don't know anything about your relationship with Simone, and I don't want to, either. - No, it's... - I said, I don't want to know. But I want you to know he's been deeply hurt, because Veronica was worse than a tarantula. So, take great care of him. Well, thank you, then. How can we find Giovanna's address, to make sure she's off sick? You're still going on about this? I'm sorry, Pauline, I can't go along with your ravings. - What ravings? - It's totally absurd. - We have no proof. - Which is why we must investigate. I don't want to accuse my colleagues, especially as it was possibly not even a murder. - You're chickening out. - No, I'm not. When you asked me to ask questions, I did, I got the information. But the problem is, you went on to interpret it. But frankly, playing Hercule Poirot and accusing Giovanna of murder while she has an upset tummy is not my style. Fine, I'll carry on by myself. Still, I did you quite a favour by replacing that girl - and dancing a jig with you. - A jig? We have every reason to believe that Giovanna and Mr Dominique are criminal lovers. "Amanti criminali", as you say. I think you've watched too much Scooby-Doo, as a child. The big dog detective. Thank you, I know who Scooby-Doo is. Right, I understand. You're worried about losing your job, and thinking about it, I don't need a ball and chain. What they tie on prisoners' feet, to stop them from walking. A ball and chain, which would hinder my investigations. What's the matter? Nothing, I'm just a bit sad. Have you and Wilfried had an argument? No, Wilfried and I are fine. They sent me the new season's scenario. I have an accident in the second episode, I'm paralysed and in a coma. A vegetable. That's great. - Excuse me? - Well, yes. A true character study, it means they have faith in you. Except anybody can play a mummy lying on a bed, don't you think? I don't even know if I'm going to live. If they take me off the drip in the seventh episode, I'm dead. At least, you'll go on a high note, it can be very moving. Damn, I forgot to sign. Nice hair bun. - It suits you. - Thank you. Where were you? I called your room and your mobile. I went for a run. - Dressed like this? - No. I went upstairs and I came back down. It sounds a bit fishy. - Do you like it, here, otherwise? - Yes, more and more. Good evening, it's Pauline. I just wanted to know how it went with today's edition. I am interested, even when I'm on holiday. Ah, great! Would you have a chance to go down to the archives, tomorrow? I'd like to know whether we have articles about Italy, and a certain Giovanna Perroni. Hi, there! - Hello. - Have you heard? - We'll have to stock up. - What do you mean? So, you've not heard? They're having to replace the chef. A new chef in the kitchen? I heard it at the swimming pool. The chef and his team got the sack, and as they haven't found a new one, yet, they may have to use a catering company. - You're pulling my leg. - Unless it's just a rumour. But from what I heard, they asked a company. What is it, they provide... Ready meals! Don't worry, they are also leaders in vacuum-packed food. I'm more than happy with a tub of coleslaw. Not me, I'm not happy with that at all! We'll see about that, ready meals?! Whatever next? I've heard everything, now. Ready meals! I'm going to give them a piece of my mind. - Who are you trying to talk to? - The restaurant. - Try someone else. - One moment. Try to call Mr Dominique. - I can't disturb him. - Doesn't he have a mobile phone? Tell them I think it is totally unacceptable to be offered fast food in a palace. Tell them! Here. - What is it? - Giovanna's details. You wouldn't help me, so I faced the peril alone. Do you want a medal? No, but I'd like to pay her a little visit, and I can't find a taxi or a bus. I told you, I'm not getting involved, find someone else. I just wanted to borrow your car. No. - Please! - No! What difference does it make? It's just sitting on the car park. - Can you even drive? - Of course, I can drive. I'll even take it to a car wash. It will look brand new. A soft top in a car wash? Brilliant idea. Come on, please! I promise I won't bother you again. - Here. - Thank you. - The documents are inside. - Paulinette! See you later. Not a word about my investigation. - How are you? - Not too good. Wilfried's gone to play golf, but I woke up all achy. Today's orders, farniente. What did the beach attendant want? He was telling me about his pontoon's subsidence. Where shall we sit? Hey! You told me fibs, they never had any plans to get a new chef. Rumours... - What's up with her? - Who knows, she's off her trolley. Fancy some water sports? Jet ski, banana boat... Yes, why not? Are you coming, Jeanne? No, I told you, I don't feel well. Yes, but you'll feel better, out on a banana boat. Come on, let's go. Get her out of my way. - How? - You decide. Come on, hurry up! Let me just check my whistle is working. For pity's sake, not this. I left at least 15 messages, you never get back to me. I need you, I miss you, you see... Why didn't you get back to me? I didn't feel like it. Wipe your feet. You're really tense, all stressed... It's your massage, that stresses me out. And I'm scared, she's threatened me. She didn't mean it, she has no proof against us, anyway. You're not the first one she does this to. Yes, I'm quite sure you've shagged a few receptionists, before me! What are you talking about? She's just jealous. She wanted to warn you, as a preventive measure. When someone tells me that if they see me again, they'll blow my head up with a shotgun, I'd rather stay at home. You shouldn't, it's like saying she's right. But she is, we've been sleeping together for two months. How would she not know? Just come back. To spend all day behind this bloody desk? What's your plan, then? Stay at home all day and never go out again? Even here, I'm scared she'll turn up. She's capable of the worst. I've been lumbered with her 22 years, she's never hurt a fly. Maybe she followed you here. That's it, she may even be listening to us. - It would be quite possible. - Let's go and check. Come on. For all you know, she's in the wardrobe. Come on, don't worry. We've been careful, she has no proof. You keep lots of pretty things, in here. That's because you haven't seen this one. Ah, yes. Come with me. Something wrong? I don't really understand. Are you out of your mind? She's crazy! Are you mad? Stop it! OK, mio. Oh, my God! This is the garage you'll have to pick the car from. It will take a good week. I expect they'll give me a courtesy car? No, I asked them, they have nothing available. - How do I get back to the hotel? - Taxi. Or there's a bus stop, just outside. It's your friend, Simone. Tell him it's not my fault. Ask him if he could send a car from the hotel. What did he say? That you'll go on the bus, like everyone else. Very well. Can I go? Yes, you're free to go. Fiorentino. - All right, then, best of luck. - Thank you very much. - The exit's this way. - Thank you. Forgive me, barging in. I forgot to say that I have a French mobile phone, so if you want to call me, you start with 0033. We know each other, don't we? I don't think so. - This is where I saw you. - Possibly, I was there recently. - Why, is something going on? - No, nothing, don't worry. I'm a friend of Mr Dominique's, I just paid him a courtesy visit. Wonderful, I'll let you get on. Don't forget, 0033, just in case. How lucky you happened to be going to the Medusa Hotel, I'd been waiting for a good 20 minutes. Transport needs to be improved, in your region. I'm sorry, my French isn't very good. It's not a problem, thank you, anyway. Wasn't that the way? Hello, it's Virginie. - Have you found something? - No, nothing. You did say Giovanna Perroni, didn't you? Yes. I had a good look, but there was nothing at all. - Just as well, then. - How about you, not too scared? What of? The mad man who killed the three girls. - No, they caught him. - They thought they had. It wasn't him, the guy is still at large. Are you sure? We even published his Photofit in the last issue. What does he look like? Early 60's, short hair, stocky... A thick neck, like a de Niro who's had too much pasta. This is quite precise. Yes, as you say, I'm safe, at least. Listen, thanks for your call. See you very soon. Maybe... Could we stop in a petrol station to buy some water? SHE WENT ON HOLIDAY FOR A REST, NOW SHE RESTS IN PEACE. You probably know the procedure, by now. For your information, the serial killer only attacked 60-year-old women. In other words, you're not his type. Just telling you in case you felt at risk, again. Also... He strangled all his victims with a karate black belt. It's not an item everyone keeps at home, but it's a really common sport in this country, just to warn you. It's very kind of you. Come on, I'll take you back. Am I facing any charges? It depends on whether the driver lodges a complaint or not. If I was him, I'd give you a good kick up your bun. - My what? - Your bun. Ah, OK... After you. - Hi. - Hi... You do have a problem with cars. Did it go all right? Very well, thank you, it was very nice. I'm sorry, though it's not my fault, I didn't marry the witch. Are you blaming me? No, but you're cross with me. I didn't exactly enjoy myself. Conducting an investigation is always a bit risky. I've decided to forget it. You saw Giovanna in bed, coughing, and you left? Not exactly, but I believe she's innocent. What? I wouldn't have had to pay for the repair of the car. What happened then, you caused a second accident? I couldn't have done, since I didn't cause the first one. But when I wanted to return to the hotel, as you wouldn't send a car for me, I hitched a lift, and I thought the driver was the psycho on the run. - Does it matter? - No, you're right. An innocent man ended up in hospital, it doesn't matter. Is he still alive? They've just spoken to him, the prognosis is good. What are you doing, are you following me? Can't you take me back to the hotel? No, I have something to do, the hotel is out of my way. - You could make an effort. - Make an effort? I keep doing it, and in return, all I get is problems. You exploit me, you make no efforts yourself. You treat me like a flunkey. I'm tired, and I need a bath. We'll sort your sensitivity issues later. I'm the one you should be nice to, I got assaulted by your mad wife. That's right, you look traumatised. I'll pay the fare, so you won't think that I'm taking advantage. What? I don't want your money. What do you want? I want you to be kinder and to show respect. And to stop treating me like your slave. You just want Simone to help you with your investigation. Did you not hear me say it's over? the case is closed. Finished. From now on, you'll discover a new Pauline. Absolutely. I can be kind and thoughtful. Can you open the door, please? You're such a good driver! It's incredible, I can't even tell when you change gear. Being kind doesn't necessarily mean brown-nosing. Look what I managed to salvage before they took your car away. They say music soothes the mind. Unfortunately, it's going to be difficult. Can I come? No, wait for me here, I won't be long. I asked my Grandma to sew them back on, they were dangling. I'm dancing at the hotel, tonight, I was worried they'd fall off. I understand. Pompoms are a serious matter. - Don't stay there, come in. - Thank you. What are you laughing at? Blond hair really suited you, it's incredible. A Marilyn je ne sais quoi. Put this back where it was, please. She's asking if you're hungry. I didn't like to ask, but after what my ordeal, I wouldn't mind a snack. There was a lot of it, but it was delicious. My compliments to the chef. Tell her yourself, she'll be pleased. It's easy. What does it mean? That it was lovely, and that you're full. What did you make me say to her? No, refusing food from an elderly lady is rude. Will you come and watch me dance? - At what time? - After diner. I'll give that a miss. Funnily enough, I'm not hungry. Have a rest, and come and see me afterwards. - I'd like you to. - We'll see. Oh, sorry, I mustn't talk to you like this. I'd forgotten I have to be nice, now. But I've already improved, haven't I? I'd say "Could do better." "Could do better?" You're setting the bar a bit high. My standards are quite high. It's not the impression I had when I met your wife. See you later. Maybe. Coming! Good evening. What do you think of this? Why is it so red? Why? Simply because after being dragged for hours, I let go, and I found myself surrounded by insatiable jelly fish. My turn to ask you something, where were you while I was zigzagging in the water at full pelt? I went to the foyer, and the shuttle bus was about to go to the town centre. I couldn't resist, I jumped on. Very plausible. OK, you want the truth? All right, I confess. I let you go off on this buoy to go and visit the criminology museum. A criminology museum, here, in the middle of nowhere? Absolutely. We may be safe in our little bubble, here, but the outside world is a hub for criminal underworld. - Where there other visitors? - Yes, quite a few. It's not a very big museum, but it's really well presented. Luckily, they have audio guides in French... Did I not tell you she's off her trolley? We've not seen you all day, so at least, have dinner with us tonight. See you in the dining room in 30 minutes. I would cover up for you again, but I doubt it would work, tonight. What, now? I'm sorry, may I borrow him, please? - Where are we going? - You'll be glad you came. Straight to the point, but not unpleasant. The bloke who's singing, he's the one who gave me a lift. Let's go and get better acquainted. If he'd seen me, he would have beaten me up. Calm down! Let's get back to our unfinished business. Yes, but first, back to our investigation. Look up there, do you know what this is? A CCTV camera. Yes, sir, they are all over the place. Maybe we didn't go about it the right way. If someone went in Miss Blanchot's room to kill her, all we need to do is watch the videos, to find out who it was. Didn't we agree this charade was over? Except this new development changes everything. The video could tell us who did it. Simone, I know I've made a few blunders, but this is our chance to know the truth. and to stop accusing innocent people. - What are you doing? - Warning the singer. - Simone, please! - You can't use people like this. It's my turn to give you orders. Kiss me. But... There are cameras everywhere, remember? I don't want our private life to be thrown to the mercy of the security team, whom we are going to see immediately, actually. Assuming the thought of doing justice in memory of the poor victim isn't too much of a pain, for you. "A pain", this is exactly what you are. It's highly likely the police will have watched the videos, already. I don't trust anything the police has done to solve the case. All right, come with me. We're not going through the garden, are we, it's not a trap? What is it, a secret passage? It's what we call the backstairs. Well? Is the murder lead being confirmed? Very well, you win. I expect this means I'm a lunatic. Your serial killer is escaping. I've looked everywhere, no cameras. Simone, I'm going to need a bit of time. I'm a bit fragile, at the moment. My relationship ended just about two weeks ago, and I'm finding it hard to... I put on a front, but I'm not happy. I don't want to take you for a ride. It would be good to get to know each other better. I'm not too keen on the one-night stand and back to the way things were scenario. I've done it, of course, but... - Pauline. - What? What does it mean? Be quiet. Hello stranger. - Nice evening? - Very nice, thank you. You played your cards close to your chest, you naughty girl. Where's your Simone? - Day off. - I see. What is he like in bed? I'm not talking about this with you. Which means he's no good and you're too embarrassed to tell me. No, but I don't want to hear about you and Wilfried... Not much to tell. I don't want to know or to tell you anything. All right. I see you don't fancy confiding in your sister. To make it up to me, you could fetch my sun lotion, I forgot it. You should have kept the waist bag, shouldn't you? Very funny! Simone, it's me! May I watch this, please? - What is it? - It's what I'm wondering. Do you remember this? I remember going to the night club and drinking too much. It looks like you did, yes. You went to the wrong room, you went to Miss Blanchot's. - It's her, isn't it? - Yes. You probably collapsed in front of her, she took you back to your room. I promise you, I can't remember a thing. Ah, Pauline... Where's Jeanne? Getting information from the tour office. Maybe you can help. What's this tape? - Where did you find it? - In Jeanne's vanity case. - Have you watched it? - Yes, I have. With Simone, so that you know. I know you're a man of few words, but you must tell me everything. There was no other option. - It was the only way. - Meaning? You killed her! No, no one's killed anyone. Do you remember the night you went to the night club? Yes, I was completely drunk, I went to the wrong room. - Do you remember it? - No, but it was on the tape. Miss Blanchot took me back to my room, but what happened after that? You must have gone to sleep and she went to your bathroom. To get you some water? The floor was very wet, she must have had a fatal fall. She hit her head on the basin, she died on the spot. When we came to wake you up, in the morning, we found her. As you can imagine, your sister started to scream. Calm down! How could I? Pauline! Let her sleep, don't wake her up. We'll find a solution, there must be a solution. Let's not make things worse, you can see it was an accident. Please, Jeanne, listen to me. If Miss Blanchot is found in this bathroom, there will be an investigation. Pauline could be accused. Do you want her to be arrested and sent to prison? Do you want the press to talk about you because of this? Pauline is too fragile, right now, she mustn't be mixed up in this. And you mustn't be involved either. What do you suggest, then? We must put Miss Blanchot's body back in her room. What?! Make it look like the accident happened there. Not here. We had to walk 10m to get back to our room. We were scared someone would open a door or come out of the lift. In the end we got to her door, and we thought we were safe. But your sister saw the cameras. Why did I listen to you? For all you know, the cameras don't work, they're just a deterrent. We were filmed, Wilfried, do you understand? If they watch the video, we've had it. OK, we may have been filmed. Why didn't we explain the situation to Mr Dominique straight away? We'll all end up in prison, not just Pauline. Maybe they still have the death penalty, in this country. We'll all die, because of you. Stop acting, please. I'm going to find the security office and get this tape. Meanwhile, put water all over the bathroom. - All right, Jeanne? - Yes, all right. Once the bathroom is all wet, move the body next to the bath, on the floor. Then, leave the room discreetly, and go and have breakfast. I don't really feel like having breakfast. It's going to work, trust me. Are you sure no one saw you? Sure. - What about you, any problems? - No. - Well... - What's the matter? I forgot to put her in the bathroom. What? I left her on the bed. Fortunately, the police didn't bat an eyelid. They thought that she got back to her bed and died in her sleep. When the truth is that I killed her. What are you talking about? She died of a domestic accident. Even if you'd been awake, you couldn't have saved her. That's why we chose to keep you out of it. This holiday was meant for you to get over your break-up, not for you to feel guilty. Were you never going to tell me? Your passion for news items may have complicated matters. There, you know everything. It's not been easy, we've been asking ourselves lots of questions. We're not proud of what we did, but we had to. Probably. I'd rather you didn't mention it to your sister, just yet. She's just about getting over it, I'd like her to enjoy her holiday. - Going back could be trying. - Why? They take her off the drip! Not just that. I want to get divorced. Really, but why? I'm sick of being the steward, the personal assistant... That's what your sister wants, not a husband. We sleep in separate beds. Lucie is old enough, she'll understand. Forgive me, it's a lot to take in. I'm going to get some fresh air. Don't worry, Pauline, I won't be a bastard. Yeah... What are you going to tell Simone, regarding Miss Blanchot? The truth, that no one killed anyone. Here you are! Thanks for the sun lotion. I'm sorry, I couldn't find it. What's the matter, is something wrong? No, I'm fine, absolutely fine. I went to ask about tours. We must take you to the Cinque Terre, it's amazing. And I went to the shop. - What is it? - Open it. - It is your perfume, isn't it? - Yes. - I'd do anything, for you. - Thank you. Thank you, Jeanne. And now, four... He must be pleased with himself. Pauline! He'll be frolicking with her tonight. I'm telling you again, there are no flights. They are sold out, that's right. Sold out until next Thursday. What are "orecchiette"? They are small pasta shapes, like little ears. Wilfried, get the waiter, please. Good evening. There's a positive side to crime. They're serving lobster, tonight, we may get double helpings. As long as they don't kill the chef, she's as happy as Larry. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, thank you. Your support has really helped me through this difficult day. We won't let the circumstances ruin your holiday. We'll do everything we can for you to keep having a good time. My wife, Luigina, will be buried in the village where she was born, in Lombardy. So, I'll be away at the end of the week. But until then, I'm going to be around, and I want to see you all smile, just like you've always done. Have a good evening. What an honourable man! Could I have the keys to the van, I have to go back to work. No, don't get me all wet! Darling, have you ever tried swimming shorts? - Call her on her mobile. - That's what I keep doing. What is she up to, now? I hope she's not had an accident, again. "Again"? Enjoy your meal! - Have you seen the time? - I'm here. - We ordered for you. - You did right. Pauline! Where is she going? Your attention, please... Oh, sorry! I'm sorry to disturb you while you're eating, I won't be long. I'm speaking to Mr Dominique, on behalf of everyone, here. Please accept our sincere condolences. I admire your courage and your dignity. You hide your grief to ease our anxiety, so that we can still enjoy our stay. It's not easy to do, but you handle the task superbly. However, the remarkable poise you're showing in these tragic circumstances could be seen as a sign of hypocrisy. But I, for one, would be more categorical. You're a rotten swine. Mr Dominique, I'm accusing you of murdering your wife. Have a good laugh, Mr Dominique, enjoy your last moments of freedom. The law's sword of Damocles will soon fall on your head. Now, in fact. - Captain Fiorentino, handcuff him. - What are you doing? Calm down, please! Look, Giovanna's received the same treatment, and she's not flinching. I never had a chance to tell you, Giovanna, I love your shoes. You, cow! - I want to speak to my solicitor. - You will, it's the procedure. Take them in! You shouldn't really believe what you read in the papers. Trust me, I'm a journalist. Mr Dominique thought he was being clever by copying the killer's doings, as described in the press. But they don't reveal everything. Or the police doesn't, to the press, so that no one ventures to copy the murderer. Everyone read that the latter strangled his victims, all of them married, in their 60's, with a karate black belt. But that's not all. The police carefully kept quiet about another detail. And unfortunately, Mr Dominique didn't think about this. Have a very good evening. Would you pour me a glass of rosé, please? I don't know about you, but I'm ravenous. I'm going to move heaven and earth to find the same shoes as Giovanna. Good evening. Limoncello for everyone! Are you finally going to tell us what the other detail was? You're intrigued, aren't you? Villanova carelessly showed me the photos of the three victims, as their bodies were found. All strangled, but I noticed they were also plastered with make-up. But Mrs Dominique had no make-up on. I went to see Captain Fiorentino, who admitted it was the detail they had concealed from the press, so as to not inspire others. No, just a professional quirk. Well done, you should be proud of yourself. I would have much preferred arresting the real serial killer, who is still at large. I have a journalist on the phone, who'd like to interview you. Tell him to come round, sometime tomorrow. Jeanne, would you like to join me? Let's remind him I'm also the famous Jeanne Fayard's sister. Wait, turn the TV sound up, please. It's me. I'm coming! I was just thinking, maybe we should go to the shed, to get the manuscript Miss Blanchot was working on. I'd love to read it, I'm sure it's really interesting. It may even be worth publishing, posthumously. THE END? SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
