This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. Do not let me ramble. August 1975, I got the letter to say, "Go and view 13 Grenfell Tower." Well, when I looked at it, I thought it was a palace compared to what I was coming from. Over the years, we built it up and it became home. I'm Mona Qabbani. Um, I lived in Grenfell Tower Flat 85 on the 11th floor. I am Turufat Yilma. I used to live at Grenfell Tower since 1996. My wife and I, we lived there for 34 years. I moved into Grenfell Tower in 2001. I've been in Grenfell Tower since birth, which was in 1981. Good fun for me growing up, especially on Lancaster West Estate where the tower sits. A multitude of friends, just hanging out. Because we had a base, this was our base, this was a fortress, it was a concrete castle. We all got to know each other very well because we used to spend an inordinate amount of time waiting in the lobby for the lifts that never worked. I got married while I was in the tower, I had both my kids while I was in the tower. You know, I was very proud to live there and it's just a tragedy that we're not able to show people... ..er, you know, what we were actually like any more. My wallet, paperwork and just toiletries. I lost everything in the fire. I lost everything. So, what I've got is whatever I've got from people, like clothes, clothes, clothes what was given to me, clothes what was given to me by different organisations. And this phone. This little A to B phone. That's it. That's disgusting. I'm still biting them! When I close my eyes, I can see, like now, I can see the stairway, I can see the lift, I can see my front door. Certain things, flashes. That feeling of running down the stairs... ..that's the killer for me. That's the killer for me. That's the killer, that's the killer. I have been filming every other day for the last nine months. I know I'm not supposed to fly the drone... ..but I film different angles to try and show any other image than what it normally looks like. Although they do not condone it, my psychologists believe that it's some way that I've been self-medicating to get over what I witnessed. It's something we never speak about, we never speak about at home. It seems easier to push it...at the back of your mind. You find yourself holding a lot of feelings within. They're kind of hard to get your head around. It becomes a common factor for friends and family within the community that, the night of the 13th tends to be a sleepless night. HE BREATHES DEEPLY SMOKE ALARM BEEPS IN DISTANCE I was lying in bed. I heard my neighbour's smoke alarm, so, no central fire alarm, just my neighbour's fire alarm. Going, "Ping, ping, ping." Went to my front door. I opened it a fraction... SMOKE ALARM BLARES, BANGING HE CLOSES DOOR Smoke, thick, acrid smoke just came billowing through the gap. Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi. Something crazy is happening. Can you believe this, bro? My wife and I started getting telephone calls from my friend, Simon, saying, "Nick, there's a fire in the tower." I just didn't take notice. I was quite blase about it. "OK, don't worry. "Just stay put, in your flat, "it's concrete, it's not going to go anywhere. "The fire brigade will have enough time to put it out." SIREN BLARES Jesus Christ, mate. That's not a real block with people in it? That's a real block. Oh, shit. It's Towering Inferno, isn't it? I had fallen asleep on the sofa. And I got woken up by fire engines. Took absolutely no notice. It's absolutely usual. Regular occurrence. Fire engines come, someone's stuck in the lift. Could be anything. SIRENS BLARE We went outside. A man ran by me and he was obviously shaken up. I stopped him, I said, "Where are you going?" And he said, "My building's on fire." So I was like, "Your building's on fire?" So I was just like, "OK, I'm coming." How is that possible?! Jumped up all the way along the flats, look. I called 999. They said, "Yes, we are aware of the situation. "Just stay inside." I made another phone call to the fire brigade. They just said, "Look, we know you're there." In the end, after I closed all the doors and everything in the flat... ..in the end we just... ..just trapped in our bathroom. This is crazy, man. This is a building in London. Ladbroke Grove, West London, Latimer. Grenfell Tower. Grenfell Tower. Grenfell Tower! The firemen are just going in now as well, man. I went to the bathroom, I got a towel, I wetted the towel, I wrapped the towel around my face and then I left my property. To negotiate my way from my flat to where the emergency exit was was probably about... ..probably about 20 foot. I couldn't see a thing. Oh, my days, man. Oh, my days. Oh, my days. We just walked towards the tower. There was massive bits of debris falling off the building, still on fire. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out! Heads up! Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Days! Whoa! The heat alone was really unbearable. And we was a good 20 metres away from the building. Everyone on this Facebook live, pray for those people in there right now. There's people... Get out! Get out! Fire! Get right back! Get right back now! I was just going on the instinct of where I thought the door was. I had my towel held around my... ..round the back of my head. I was pawing at the wall with this hand and then I started panicking, and I let go of the towel and started pawing at the wall with my other hand. And then I sort of thought, "I'm not going to get out of this," and started inhaling the smoke. And, then, at that moment, a fireman came and I felt that he touched my leg and, in touching my leg, I looked down and, then, in looking down, I was able to see that it appeared... ..I was right next to where the door was, but I wasn't at the door. And I was able to see the light that led to the door. So, I just ran for my life, basically, down the stairs. And then I got outside the front of the building, the whole of the side of the building was ablaze. And... Yeah, I just started, like... You can see the fire going straight up. It looked like one of... a movie scene. There's someone right at the top as well, man. Look at these people, look at these people. SIRENS BLARE Police completely cordoned off the roads. Whoa, they're kicking us off. They're kicking us off. HELICOPTER WHIRS OVERHEAD The front of the building got so heated, people were running to the back of the building into other people's rooms. And we could see them. Keep your window open! They're coming up! Keep your window open! 7th, the 11th, the 17th, kids, women, old people. Oh, no. She's trapped inside. Get a blanket, wet it, try and make your way down! EXPLOSION PEOPLE EXCLAIM: Whoa! What floor are you on? 11th! 11! She's stuck on the 11th floor. Someone run through there and tell them, 11th floor. TRAPPED WOMAN: Is someone coming? On the 11th floor, there was a woman shouting, "Is anyone coming?" We shouted out, you know, "Who are you with?" She goes, "I have a child." They're in their floor, they're just in the window, but they can't see what we could see is happening on the top of them. And that building on top of them is red-hot. EXPLOSION Oh, my God. The fire... They've got a matter of minutes before it spreads to her floor, basically. What I loved about the firefighters was that they weren't denying the fact that they needed us to communicate with them. Because where they were, they couldn't see what we could see. PEOPLE SPEAK AT ONCE They're trying to get in, they're trying. See that window below? See that man there? You have got to direct the water above the floor. OK. All right. Through that alleyway was the firefighters on the ground. It was like a chain. There we go. Yes, yes, yes. Tell him to swing it right, tell him to swing it... There we go. Yes, man, there we go. I can see the woman right now, fam. Still so helpless. My main concern was keeping my daughter calm. I needed her to know that we were going to get out, cos I told her we were going to get out. Windows were starting to crack. A couple of them blew out. Eventually, my sister called me, she said, "I'm with a firefighter, "they're on their way to get you." I could hear the door being kicked in and then I just... ..all I can remember is, I just saw an arm come out, and kind of grabbed my wife. And then another arm come and grabbed me, I didn't really see... ..see the people. And, then, it was just out into the darkness. As we were going down and around and around and around and around and around, you know, I'm stepping on things, you know... I had my arm around my wife's waist, but then she disappeared into the darkness. So I was just shouting, like, "Where's my wife? "Where's my wife?" We eventually got into some triage area. And... But then I looked over and I just see somebody... ..having CPR. And I thought my wife was dead. And then... Nick was out sitting on the floor at triage point number three. A lady came out, I now know it to be his wife, but at the time I didn't know. And then somebody came over and said, "Is this your wife?" And I was like, "Oh, my God, I thought..." And then he looked up and he said, "Oh, darling, we've lost everything." I'll never forget those words. He said, "Oh, darling, we've lost everything." TV: In West London, the fire brigade right now are dealing with a serious fire in a tower block. A 23-storey residential block of flats in Kensington. My name's Joe Walsh. I'm 58. I was born in the area. I've lived in the area all my life. The Maxilla Club is just opposite the tower. We opened at two o'clock that morning for tea and coffee. My wife grabbed whatever we had in the house and... ..brought it down. I was texted by the caretaker, telling me that we may need to open our doors to... ..host some of those survivors. Opening the church, turning on the lights, felt to me the most important thing I had ever done as a priest. By the time I got to the club for about three o'clock, people were already in the building. People just literally came out in their dressing gowns, nighties, tracksuit bottoms. Shirts on their backs. That's all these people had at the beginning. I hope you're OK, man. People needed somewhere safe to go. A really private space that was theirs and theirs alone. We were just standing there and the people came from the Portobello Rugby Club and led us in there. It was sort of like a refugee camp is the best way I can describe it. We'd got people in every room, sitting on the floor, sitting on chairs. Bereft, wearing little. Some were more affected than others, some were like, "I had my wife with me, I had my kids." And some of them were still in the fire. There are still people inside this building. Look, look, look, there is someone in the top, shining his light. There is a family there, there is a family, there's kids. Hello! We're stuck on the 23rd floor! There's too many people stuck upstairs. The most painful thing of this whole thing, they wasn't coming out. They were just inside. There was long periods of nothing. That's bad for me because I just feel like, well, they stayed inside because that's what they were told to do. As you can see, it's alight from top to bottom, the fire started at the third or fourth floor. SIRENS BLARE I grew up about a 60-second walk from Grenfell Tower. Somewhere I loved to be. I ended up actually at the St Clement James Centre at about four in the morning on June 14th. It was a matter of comforting those who had been evacuated from their homes. I think the most vivid memory was when the first firemen came in for a cup of coffee, that look on their face and the smell, the odour that came from them, that smell of smoke, that smell of burning, it wouldn't go anywhere. You know, you can read people's facial expressions and you can tend to read people's emotions. I could just see that they'd gone through stuff that no man, woman or child should have to go through. The fact that the firemen had managed to even attempt running into a building ablaze like that was crazy to get your head around. We're not aware at this stage of anybody being trapped in this building, which is owned by the local authority. There are certain terms that we use in everyday life that I've never really understood. We use the term "when your heart skips a beat", and I've never had that feeling until looking at the tower after, and it happens to this day now, every time my eyes focus on the tower, you, you miss a breath. PEOPLE WAIL I usually wake up for work at around half past five. And while I was in the shower, my wife just started screaming. I thought that she'd hurt herself or she'd fell. She just said to me, "Karim, Grenfell Tower is on fire." It's pretty clear the fire has taken hold again with a vengeance. There are big pieces falling off the building itself. # Happy birthday, dear Hesham. # My uncle, Hesham Rahman, he wasn't just my uncle. My father lived in Egypt and never came to the country. Uncle Hesham was like my father. Coming from a Muslim family, we didn't celebrate Christmas, but he would always turn up on Christmas and I remember the first-ever time I got a Christmas present was because of him. He came in and he had this big present wrapped and it was like a Tyrannosaurus sort of Lego type of thing. I was like, "Wow!" He taught me how to read and write Arabic, which was very hard. He used to tell me to write, "I am a donkey." That was the first thing I learned how to write in Arabic. So he made me write swearing at myself! Someone will see something. I was running around, just at all costs avoided looking up because I knew where his flat was. Hi, guys. He lived on the 23rd floor of the tower. I have my mother, my sister... ..my brother-in-law... ..and the three children, his three children, my sister's three children, all on the 22nd floor. OK, this is the BBC News helicopter going to Battersea for fuel. We had searched all the shelters. We started to visit all the hospitals. We were given so many hospitals - that they could be at this hospital. And we went through each hospital, driving from this hospital to that hospital, phoning at the same time to check to see if they had been checked in. Just tell us, what floor were they in? They were on the 22nd floor at the time of the fire. We appealed via news to see if anyone had seen them. Maybe they had gone into someone's house or they didn't have a phone, whatever, whatever. My brother, he has the pictures of my sister, her children. Our prayers go to everybody. 10am in the morning. There was just hundreds and hundreds of people just out in the streets. You know, you don't know what's just happened, it's surreal. What I loved is how quick the community came together. What's your name, bro? Jerel. Jerel, yeah? Yeah. What's your name? Hassan, Hassan. What's your name? Mohammed. Mohammed, how old are you? 17. You're 17. How old are you? 17. So, guys, look, we've got all of you from all across the community, look. Bags and bags and bags, bags and bags and bags of things. They're just literally unloading them. So if you guys have got anything you want to bring down, just bring it down here. When the fire happened, everybody obviously was in shock and felt helpless. People were actually coming in then to donate stuff. They were bringing sheets, blankets, slippers, anything down. And within 12 hours... ..you couldn't see any of our floor space. HUBBUB The donations started coming through to the Harrow Club. Everybody pitching in, grabbing water, bringing jackets, bringing bedding, doing whatever they needed to do, whatever they could contribute. The poorest people giving us shirts off their back, giving a pack of beans, even. I've done in relief work abroad in India and Africa, so then we just then treated it like a disaster abroad. The big need was to feed everybody. People had been here since the early hours, and this is how we started off, just by serving food, which was curry and chapatis, and curry and rice. So we've come from Essex, Barking and Dagenham, and Rainham. This is all donations from people from the local boroughs that have donated. Where are you from, mate? Northampton. You've got the whole community pulling together, working side by side. Look, toiletries, kids' stuff. Come on! Muslim people, Sikh people, Hindu people, Afro-Caribbean, Greek people, English people. And the only group that I hadn't actually seen was the Jewish community. I actually jokingly said to one of my friends, "If the Jewish people turn up, that's a full house. "That's ten out of ten." And then just as I'd said it, about ten minutes later, four, five cars rolled up with some Ashkenazi, you know, like, Orthodox Jews, dressed in their sort of black coats and stuff. And they pulled up with supplies. I mean, it was chaos. We were very traumatised and it was a chaotic scene. My overriding memory of it is the assistance that came from the community. Someone came up to me and said, you know, "Do you want a cup of tea?" Someone else came up to me and said, you know, "What size shoes are you? "We've got some people who have donated." And I looked, it was just like a row of donations. Just, like, clothes and shoes and nappies, deodorants and things, just toiletries and all sorts. And I just remember, that's when it hit me, that I'm the recipient... ..of this charity from people. Because I've lost everything, I don't have anything. Nothing with me, everything is gone. You know, only a few years back, a few winters back, we were packing boxes to send to Syria. Oh, there are some nice trainers there. I don't like asking people for something. But then, on another note, what would we have done without them? Well, I've lived in Grenfell Tower, I was the first tenant to move in there. Moved in there in 1975, come from this area, parents come from this area, grandparents come from this area. Notting Hill, as we call it. Great-grandparents, going all the way up, come from this area. My two grandchildren were born while I was in Grenfell. Everything, my whole life was in that flat. Oh, it's an absolute, it's a horror story. I keep hoping that someone is going to pinch me and I'm going to wake up and it's all going to be a bad dream. But, unfortunately, it's not. Everything's gone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm right opposite, in the tower blocks. Come out my house, I always see it. Don't be silly. You've got nothing to be sorry about. I saw it all, as well, from quarter to one, one o'clock, I saw it all. I think me volunteering has helped me because I'm always doing something. I'm born and bred in West London, so I've always been a West Londoner. Which is for this lady, size 62. People are together. CHANTING The Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, we had an open-door policy where anyone who walks through the door - just to be welcomed and to be assisted in any way they wished. There was an occasion, a young English guy came to the centre. They said, "I need a candle and a lighter and a private space. "That's all I need." He stayed silently for a few minutes and he said, "That's all I wanted to do. "Thank you so much, I really like this place. "I lost a brother in the tower, "and I wanted to pray for him, and that's it." And I was really so touched by it. At the time, I was still waiting for him to tell us whether he needed any "materials or anything and he just said, "That's all I needed." And he left. Our own volunteers lost people. In the case of Hassan, he lost a wife and two daughters. On the night of the fire, he was away and they were with him on a video conference. December 2016. I go to Egypt. My brother is not well. He is getting worse and worse and worse. I didn't even put in my mind, I'm going to be five or six months there. WOMAN: Hello? Come here! Come here! Hello?! ALARM BLARES Hello? OK, I'm not going, OK. My wife, she called me four, five times. "What's happening?" She said, "Fire." I said, "Where is the fire?" She tells me, "In the fourth floor." I tell her, "OK, take the kids and go out." She tell me, "No, we're OK. "The fire is down the stairs." Then I hear a lot of voices. I tell her, "Who is this?" She said, "Oh, that's the neighbour." From the voice of the guy, I can feel there is a lot of confuse...inside the flat. The smoke is coming! From the outside? In the news, I see the building. When I see the building, I take my passport and I go to the airport straightaway. I go to the duty-free. I try to buy chocolate for my two daughters. I talk with myself. I cannot go to my two daughters empty-handed after all this... ..long time. Mum, I want to go up. Push me, Mama, higher. In Islamic tradition, the dead must be buried immediately. For people to know that they won't be able to bury them for weeks and weeks and weeks, it was a very challenging situation. PRAYERS We were organising what we call prayers in absence, for those who are absent. It was very important for us to help Hassan. We let him lead that prayer himself. Allahu Akbar. INDISTINCT A whole relief effort flourished here, as in many other centres, and we felt overwhelmed. We reached a saturation point very quickly, in fact, by about three o'clock on the first day. Nobody seemed to know what was happening. There was no evidence of any coordination on the ground. There's no-one from the councils here. We've just been left. We've had nothing. We've just literally been on social media saying, "Help, help, help," and that's it. Kensington and Chelsea is a Central London council. There are 11 Labour councillors at the moment, there are two Lib Dems, and the rest of the council, which I think is 35, are Conservative councillors. I am the leader of the Labour group and one of the councillors for Notting Dale, which includes Grenfell Tower. Under the cabinet system, you have a leader who appoints a cabinet and those 10 or 11 people take all the decisions. On the day of the fire, I circled the exclusion area, looking for representatives of the council. I had to walk all the way round it and I kept thinking, "When I round the corner, "there will be council officers with clipboards putting their disasters "policy into practice, and then I can go along and assist." But I looked in vain and then a couple of hours later, I did spot the leader of the council being interviewed by television. Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council are responsible for this area, and their leader joins me now, Nick Paget-Brown. The advertisement this gives for Britain across the world, an inferno that you might see in downtown Dakar perhaps, in a tragedy, or in the Philippines, but here in a First World, fifth-largest economy... Yeah, no, I think everybody will be utterly appalled and heartbroken by the images they've seen all over the media, all over the world this morning. The council shares that heartbreak. We want to see what caused this fire to start and to spread. We've just refurbished this building. Now, I accept we will have to look very carefully at why this refurbishment appears to have accelerated or made the fire worse than it might otherwise have been. But in the 21st century, this is a human disaster of absolutely catastrophic proportions. Well, I'm afraid that is correct. SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE HE SPEAKS GERMAN WOMAN REPORTER SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE We begin with what in a modern city barely seemed possible. London, England, 12 deaths confirmed that tore through one of London's poorest addresses in one of its richest neighbourhoods. It's accepted that sometimes something unexpected will happen and there is a structure whereby other boroughs help out in an emergency. I took phone calls from the leadership of Hammersmith Council and I reported that to the leader of the council to say, Hammersmith and Fulham and Westminster and Brent and all the other boroughs are offering their assistance. I was told, "No, thank you, "we're dealing with it confidently and competently "the way we always have done." I went to sleep the first night, June 14th going into June 15th. I'd gone to sleep thinking, "OK, we've done the best that we can today. "Tomorrow we'll wake up and we'll have some help and some support." So waking up at five in the morning again and going straight over to the church to see, again, just the same faces that were there the night before and the day before, the same members of the community, the same people searching for loved ones. Still doing all of the work, still helping and no actual physical presence of authority at the time. It kind of became a realism that, if no-one is coming to help us now, they probably won't turn up any time soon. The authorities froze. And left us to look after ourselves. At the moment here in London, this is the focus of the heartbreak. A makeshift centre where people who have lost their homes are being housed. In the Rugby Portobello Club, there's a big sports hall type place, and that's where we were. And the Rugby Portobello made the club only for survivors. It was very evident that no-one was coming to help us, so we'd have to help ourselves. And we formed Grenfell United. By creating Grenfell United, we were able to start to talk amongst ourselves about coming together as a united voice. We looked after each other and we did everything together. There was no-one giving any information about what had happened to people in the tower. So on the wall of the Rugby Portobello, we all got some large paper and wrote down the numbers of the flats in Grenfell Tower and then filled in who we knew had come out... ..and who hadn't come out. GREENWICH TIME SIGNAL PIPS Many people are still missing a day after the fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower in West London. The official number of dead stands at 12. A friend of mine has gone missing. She lived on the 21st floor, I think. Social media has been great. Everyone's been posting pictures of her. She was a very... Sorry. We are aware of entire families that, at the moment, are missing and unaccounted for. Extended families spanning three generations. We drove from hospital to hospital... ..and never wanted to give up at all. I wanted to always give them that chance, maybe we'd see them or we'd find them. NEWSREADER: Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry into a fire that devastated a residential block of flats. People are beginning to realise what has happened, the scale of this disaster, the number of people... At 3am in the morning, there is a last tweet from my cousin, Khadija. "My council block is on fire, please help me, we can't get out! "Please, pray for my mum and me!" Lots of people saying, "I can't find my mother, I can't find my brother," and tales of watching people unable to leave their flats. A man told me how he saw a gentleman on fire, jumping from the tenth window. The council can't answer to all of this, because nothing went off. No fire alarms, no sprinklers. There was literally a guy just accepting where he was. He was literally just accepting it. He was looking out the window, just looking, like, "Oh, this is my fate now." Like, this is where... It was tragic to see. NEWSREADER: ..a residential block of flats in west London. 17 people and are known to have died. A senior police officer... There is a tension, a shock, an anger, and a grief hanging over this whole area, because I think that people just think, it is the 21st century. Tell the truth. People are not ignorant here. No-one should have lived there. It melted like a candle. Like a candle, it melted like a candle. Some sort of, I don't know whether it is some sort of plastic material. I have no idea. But I felt... You can see on the floor, like, it breaks so easily. It's absolutely... It's rubbish. This is from the building itself. This is what they used for the... Like, this building is bricks, on the outside they put this... For winter, it's good, because it keeps the heat in. On Twitter, there are some people who are suggesting external panels that have been fitted in recent years might have played a part. These things are conjecture, but the reason I am telling you this is because once enough people begin to say it, it still doesn't confirm that any of that is the case, but it's important to say, "This is what people are talking about." CROWD APPLAUDS Our neighbours. Our friends. Our community. Destroyed. Where is all the help? Everyone is bringing water, everyone is bringing money, everyone is bringing things. Where is the transport? People are having to carry it. Where is the Government's help to help...to help? At every moment during, from the beginning of this, we are expecting... ..the emergency, the council people to turn up, the Red Cross to turn up, Salvation Army to turn up, because we just thought we're here just to help out and there would be an A team arriving. You know, a disaster relief team, perhaps the Army is going to turn up. Extra police are going to turn up. And nobody came. No-one from the council, no-one. I feel embarrassed. Where is everybody? If you want to get one or two volunteers in each car. Cos a lot of the survivors have gone into hotels. LIFT: Doors opening. Room 127. MOBILE PHONE RINGS How is it now when the cyclones hit the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, we could send ships over with Marines and supplies, and yet we couldn't do it 2.5 miles away from Buckingham Palace? We must have got a phone call about two weeks later, saying, "Do we need any volunteers?" from the local authority, which we thought, you know, we thought they were taking the piss out of us. We expected to see somebody on site with a walkie-talkie and a hi-vis jacket, reporting back to a communication hub. There wasn't one. There were some council officers on-site, but they, like the rest of us, were fairly confused about what they should be doing. Chicken and potato. Chicken and potato. Nick Paget-Brown is the Conservative leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council. So, we know this from residents, that they have been put in a local hotel last night. They weren't told until lunchtime today whether they would be able to stay there. They weren't told whether they would be allowed to have food. They were told the council would come, the council didn't come. The truth is, be honest, you can't cope with this. I am being honest, Kirsty, and I think we have coped with it as well as we can after a tragedy of this dimension. Nick Paget-Brown, as the crisis developed, became a rabbit in the headlights. The highly paid official who had run council communications for years, resigned the day after the fire. A couple of days later we found out that Theresa May had been making promises. We are ensuring that within three weeks, people will be rehoused, so they have a home to go to. So I called the leader of the council and said, "How on earth are you going to be able to do that?" And he said, "I don't know, they didn't ask me." Can we make a chain, please, brothers? Please make a... Yes, brother. Up the stairs, bruv, up the stairs. Move up, move up, move up. KIRSTY WARK: This has gone beyond a local tragedy and become an event that has touched people across the whole country. Along with that has come intense scrutiny for politicians at a national level. Theresa May was pictured meeting the leaders of the London Fire Service. But there was no meeting with the residents. SIRENS BLARE They were on the phone, calling 999, and everyone was telling them, "Stay at home." It doesn't make sense. Why is there no alarms? Why is there no sprinklers? Does that make sense? Does that make sense? And then Theresa May didn't show her face, Jeremy Corbyn showed his face, the Queen came and showed her face. And she didn't show her face around the area. She should have been one of the first people here, she's been elected. You lose a lot of faith. It just makes you think, if something was to happen... ..you would have to rely on yourself. Effectively, what they were doing was putting their hands in their ears, saying, "La-la-la-la-la. "This is not happening," and hoping it would go away. But it wasn't going to. Why are you angry? Why am I angry? Because people in there died, people in there died and nobody is offering a solution. We want to bury our own people, missing people, we can see posters every single day, more and more faces. Where are they? They're in there! They only fixed it outside. In Canada, it is banned. In Germany, it is banned. Everywhere it is banned. But... It was just awful. It was the most awful experience for that first week, and no-one... ..no-one could say what the plan was going to be. We had some very ugly scenes outside the building on a number of occasions. The number of people known to have died has risen to at least 30. But the BBC believes that the total could be at least 70. I think there was an atmosphere of considerable anger. To find out the truth, we have to rally against lies. There are so many lies right now. My children live in this block. People have got to go to school. People have got to go to work. We lived there, we watched everything, and you lot are here every day. You don't give us no peace, no quiet. We want to grieve. We want to grieve in peace and quiet. You lot are here. Go to Kensal Road at the TMO and do what you lot have got to do. Give us peace and quiet. Our kids have got to go to school. Their friends are dead. You lot have NO respect. There's no school. Yes, it is! Oxford Gardens. Oxford Gardens. If we don't come here, we won't get the public to hear our voice. And this is the only place the people are coming to see the building. All right... All I'm saying is, what I'm saying is I appreciate that you lot are here, right? But if you lot really, really want to protest, go on Kensal Road. Their offices are there. They are the ones that said, "Yes, we want this cladding up." Everybody should go to the council, down at the town hall. That is where we should go. The first couple of days of aid was more about people's... just need and want to help the place that they love, the home that they love, the community that they love. The anger definitely started by, I think, was the lack of response and the lack of support that was offered. Power concedes nothing without demand. Yes. So we ain't asking this Government for nothing. We ain't asking this council for nothing. We are demanding! APPLAUSE AND CHEERS FROM THE CROWD So the feeling did start to grow and start to become quite tense. SHOUTING This is exactly what they wanted, man. This is what they want. It is what they wanted, innit? Stop! CROWD: We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! Living in Ladbroke Grove at Latimer Road, we talk about a lot of the younger kids. These kids are living a very difficult part of the city. It is hard to, you know... ..live with families who are depending on food banks, but then 60 seconds down the road you have multi-million pound homes, staring at your face, and the balance of having to understand that as a kid growing up in the area, is very difficult. It looks like now the crowd's moving towards the doors of the town hall, actually. If we just spin round and look... ..that is... ..the main entrance to the offices of Kensington and Chelsea Borough. It looks like people are actually trying to get in. CROWD: We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! CROWDS CONTINUE TO CHANT In the first two or three days, the atmosphere was disorientation and shock. By the time that Theresa May arrived at the church on the Friday, the atmosphere had turned rather more... ..toxic. Theresa May, St Clements... St Clements Church. Running down the road with the reporters right now. If you can make it, if you are around - come now. Now, now! Prime Minister, why have you waited so long to come and talk to the residents? Are you scared? Why have you waited so long, Prime Minister? See? Bully van, bully van. Yeah? Don't try and push through us, mate. No, no, no. She'd selected Clement James as the location to go and meet some of the residents, which was, of course, where I'd been working for the last few days. There was about 15 of us within the church hall, sat in a circle, speaking to each other. Started by very basic introductions who we were, and what we've been doing. What is £10 million for that block? It was piss-all! And then you're going to hide behind that red door. AUDIO SWITCHES TO SECURITY COMMS CROWD SHOUTS: Shame on you! Shame on you! Feelings were beginning to run quite high. We could hear people on the streets outside, there was growing unrest directly outside. By the time we could get to any point of actually discussing help or anything that needs to happen, Theresa May was alerted that there was a security issue outside. CROWD SHOUTS: Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! I could hear people screaming, "Shame on you!" The only way it could have been different is if the initial response was a lot more heartfelt and a lot more genuine. CROWD: Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! CROWD SHOUTS Stand back! Stand back! SHOUTING FROM CROWD WOMAN SHOUTS AGITATEDLY There was no hiding the fact that if the people of this area wanted to go absolutely crazy and cause pandemonium and despair, it could have been done. But we've got a culture, a deep culture here in North Kensington, that, you know, kind of allows us to use our heads as well as our physical selves. As much as I might sound angry and as much as you guys might feel that anger as well right now, we have to remain peaceful, because this is a beautiful community and we are not just representing our community now, this has gone big, this is the rest of London who are watching our community. The rest of London need to see that we don't need to act in violence, we don't need to act in anger, yeah? VOICEOVER: I wanted them to think, or look at me and see a similarity. "He looks like me," or "He may have grown up like me, "he may have been like me", and I just wanted to make sure that they were hearing that message from someone that they could relate to. The first silent walk... ..was in the midst of all the pandemonium. In the scorching heat, starting from the library in Ladbroke Grove. In the midst of all the despair, that silence just neutralised everyone and we walked through the streets that felt like a warzone, in peace and in silence and it was so empowering. Grenfell Speaks is a social news channel. I don't edit anything, I just put stuff up raw. It feels personal to me. The lapel mic that a friend donated. A... Oh, it's just broken. That is from the pound shop. Yeah, I have got another one at home, so that's OK. An iPhone. We should put it on social media, just to get a greater following, and it just shows the power of what we have in our hands. The reach is about 5 million since the channel started. There are people that watch the streams from Queensland in Australia to Brazil. Yesterday we had somebody from Florida. Forget BBC, forget ITV, you've got Twitter, you've got Facebook, you have got Instagram. Film, stream, circulate it. Because the thing is there is no-one more powerful than us collectively. WHISTLES BLOW, CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Collectively. NEWSREADER: Detectives investigating the fire which destroyed Grenfell Tower believe the number of people who may have died is higher than the current figure of 58. JON SNOW: 386 households have been uprooted from its neighbourhood and are now living in emergency accommodation. Most of them in hotels. As you will be aware, this is a private meeting of the cabinet, to which only Kensington and Chelsea councillors have been invited. On the 29th of June, the leader of the council started to read out a statement. A bland expression of regret. At which point I noticed that there were press pouring into the room at every door and every angle. We can't have an unprejudiced discussion in this room if journalists are recording and writing, and I therefore have to declare the meeting closed. So what you've done is you've actually used this as an opportunity for YOU to make a statement and nobody else gets to say anything at all. I would have liked to have had a conversation, but I am advised that we can't do that because we would be prejudiced... An absolute fiasco! This is why I am calling for your resignation. Not because of what happened in the fire, but the sheer and ongoing incompetence that this council has shown ever since it happened! Thank you. My advice is that we can't continue. You keep telling us that you're taking advice, you're taking the wrong advice. Our reputation is absolutely in the gutter. Mr Paget-Brown, will you apologise to the residents of Grenfell for the council's actions? NEWSREADER: The pressure simply got too great. The leader, deputy leader and chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Council have all resigned. The Government is drafting in a team of civil servants to help improve the official response to the Grenfell Tower fire. Many residents have said they have received little or no assistance. Waiting to hear the news about missing relatives was the most difficult situation. It just took weeks and weeks and weeks, and it was becoming very confusing but also emotionally tormenting. My nan wakes up in the morning and sees, you know, her son's graveyard, my uncle's... That is what it is, you know? It is a mass graveyard. The top floor was the hottest and it burned for the longest. What are we talking about? Are we talking about pieces of my uncle? You know, this whole month has felt like an eternity. You know, the people that have done this, nobody knows. All we're doing is waiting for information. Every day goes by, that frustration increases more and more and more. It was awful. It was like being in a really sort of dark limbo. I thought it was my responsibility to get some answers, to have some information. Trying to be realistic and logical in the situation... I spoke to a lot of media outlets, and I said to all of the journalists the same thing - you have a responsibility to make sure that you keep this alive. For me, personally, you know... VOICEOVER: By me making relationships with people in the media, I can say to other families, "Look, I trust them. "If you want to get your story out, "let the people know what is going on." My name is Yasmin and I'm 11 years old. Do you know what it is that your dad's been up to? Yeah, he's been going to a lot of meetings. The more coverage we can get... YASMIN: Every single day. When he comes back, he used to, like, come very late and he used to come, like, very tired. Tell me which family members who are still... Six members of my family. My mother, my sister... My brother-in-law and three of his kids. I don't want anyone to forget my family, and I want people to know who are these people, and how did they die? SHE SOBS GENTLY It's OK. It's all right. It's all right. We're strong. It's all right, I cried. There's nothing wrong with crying. We can't have our loved ones back and I'm sure the police have their reasons, but because they're not communicating to us and I think we have the right to ask them these types of questions. You know, what are you doing? No arrests have been made, people are been treated like witnesses, not suspects. Nobody's been brought in to be questioned. Why? One of the first meetings we recorded was the one at Clement James Church where it was quite, quite a, um, quite a vocal meeting. And then four weeks later we're asking the same questions to the same people that have no answers. We have brought the senior investigative officer for the case. PEOPLE SPEAK OVER ONE ANOTHER Four weeks after the fire, I went to a community meeting. Immediately when I got there, it became apparent I needed to stay there, it was the right place for me to be. Have you interviewed the top of the council? When I need... Make arrests first. When I need to make an arrest, I will. The test of my investigation will be whether it's done properly, not whether it's done quickly. Unfortunately, an investigation of this scale will not be quick, but it will be thorough. It will get to the bottom of whatever happened and hold those to account. CROWD GROWS RESTLESS It would be much easier for me to give a running commentary of my investigation, much easier because I wouldn't face this anger. Investigate! Like you do with the terrorists. It's impossible to conduct this investigation and pretend that you're not affected by what you're seeing and hearing about. It's impossible to not care for the bereaved families. We will be interviewing each and every firefighter that entered the building, that is 650. Each and every police officer is another 300. Each and every survivor that came from the tower, that's another approximately 255. So far we've identified 60 companies that have been involved in the construction, the refurbishment... CROWD RESPOND ANGRILY VOICEOVER: There were some real raw feelings there. But this fire hasn't affected, as has been reported, a den of illegal immigration. This fire has affected real people from many different backgrounds. Grenfell Tower could have been Grenfell Street. It's no different to any other road in London. Judge me when it's done, but... You're moving slow. If I told you the ins and outs... I was approached by... ..the police, who basically say, well, you're a prominent member of the community, and so forth, would I be interested in chairing some of the meetings that became very heated? Can I ask a question from a doctor from Birmingham, who is sitting here patiently? I can be louder than you. I live 50 yards from there. You know I live 50 yards from there. You know! First of all, put your hands up if you've got a question. Please respect everybody who's speaking, give them a chance to speak. I actually said to panel members, "You really do need to have some answers for these people." People were speculating, "Why can't we have their bodies to bury and put to rest?" But then, after speaking to the head of the site retrieving these bodies, he actually told me, "You need to come and see it for yourself." Because I was struggling, I was finding it hard thinking, "Come on, "you're massaging the figures and people are saying you're lying, "you don't want us to know the true extent of how many people died." And the bloke was like, "I just do not know." People during the course of the fire moved between rooms. So where you thought somebody would be, maybe wasn't where they would be. They would move up to the flat above or the floor below. You know, on some of the floors, we have something like 15 tonnes of material. Then he invited me to go up to the tower. We started walking up, and what it was, it was three teams of police officers. You've got pathologists in the middle, who checks for all of the bones and then you've got three big buckets, three sieves, and what they're doing is shovelling all of the stuff off of the floor into the sieve, going like that... ..seeing if there's any bones in there, pass it onto the next one. If there were any bones, the guy would log those bones. They're looking for hip replacements, knee joints, those sort of things that can survive the fire, for them to identify bodies. If there's anybody that died... ..they would have been on the floor, and then the ceilings have come on top of them and then the walls have come on top of them as well. So it's all mixed up. Then the Fire Brigade have gone in there with their hoses, so it's wetted that out. So everything's congealed together. It's like breaking crystals. They'd actually break these crystals to find out whether there's any bones in there and stuff like that. And he basically said to me, "Look, we've walked into one flat, "there could be a body there and I would never know." So it's quite a daunting task for all of those involved in trying to find out how many people actually died. REPORT: Grenfell Tower, built in 1974 by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council. A two-year refurbishment was completed last year. The building was modernised with cladding as part of an £8.5 million refurbishment programme, which was completed 12 months ago. There were big gaps between our windows and the outside after they fitted the double glazing. There was wind blowing in from underneath. The job was not... It was not done like a proper job. The boilers, these were actually going to be placed in our entrance hallways. The health and safety risk was they were positioned over the electrical fuse boxes - and when we complained about that to a senior manager, we asked him in plain English, "Well, how would you feel if this was in your flat?" His words, which I will never, ever forget were, "Well, if I was getting it for nothing, I wouldn't mind." You know, it's put down as social housing as if they're giving you something, they're not giving no-one anything. They weren't doing me no favours. I was paying for what I had. I paid £700 a month rent there. Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, or KCTMO, was responsible for Grenfell Tower until the block was engulfed in flames... The TMO was set up as an arm's length management company to separate the council from the way in which its social housing stock was managed. Very, very difficult to get someone to come. Very, very difficult. The tradition of distrust between the TMO and tenants long predates the fire and the disaster. In the last, I'd say, five years... ..it got progressively worse. You needed a repair, it would take forever. The kitchen was literally rotting away. For years I was trying to battle that. One day I was at work and the surveyor came and his comment to my mum was, "Yeah, but, you know, you've got to understand, this isn't your house." We experienced these surges of power, smoke started coming out of toasters. Lights going on and off and flashing. Sparks came out of light fittings. It just blew up two of my lamps. Our legitimate concerns about the services we were receiving from our landlord were totally ignored. It felt like we were being treated like second-class citizens. JEREMY VINE: Kensington is the richest borough in London. The average house price is £1.4 million. I think there's been a take-home message for people that they were very lucky to be living in Kensington. I was the co-author of the Grenfell Action Group blog that was documenting what was happening to our community. The council decided that they were going to place a secondary school on the residential amenities surrounding Grenfell Tower. We wrote to the council saying, "If you build a school here, "you will prevent fire engines accessing the building." November 2016, we wrote a blog. I'll read you a little bit of the blog. It goes, "It is a truly terrifying thought "that the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe "that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude "and incompetence of our landlord, the KCTMO. "The Grenfell Action group have reached the conclusion that only an "incident that results in the serious loss of life "of KCTMO residents will "allow the external scrutiny to occur that will shine a light on the "practices that characterise the malign governance "of this non-functioning organisation. "It is a conviction that a serious fire in a tower block "is the most likely reason that those that wield power "will be found and brought to justice." Everything that happened was so unnecessary and could have been prevented and, um... ..it wasn't. No justice. No peace. No justice. No peace. Good evening from here outside Kensington Town Hall as the council inside the building behind me try to appoint a new council leader. Madam Mayor, we believe that such is the anger and distrust right across the borough at the failure of this council that nothing can convince the people that you know what you're doing or that you care. The group tonight will seek to vote down the election of the new leader and we repeat our call for the imposition of commissioners to bring into effect real change now. So, shall I give you my bag, actually? If you ask me questions about the immediate aftermath and whether I think that was handled well or not, that's part of the enquiry. So if you ask me that, I'll say, "I'm afraid, "that's for the inquiry to look at "and I can only talk from where I started." Would all those in favour of Elizabeth Campbell please show. BOOING FROM PUBLIC SEATING AREA And those against. WOMAN: I'm against. OTHERS AGREE IN PUBLIC SEATING AREA I can announce that the election of Councillor Elizabeth Campbell is carried. Boo! Boo! MAN: Shame on you! I'm desperately sorry for what happened. I mean, we're all human, we all have families and things. I can't imagine anything worse... ..in the world, than watching people who you know die, and not being able to help. I mean, it's unimaginable. The way that people have been treated is disgusting. Could we please calm down? I've been put in a one-bedroom hotel room - me, my wife and my three kids. There's a double bed for five of us in there. People need to be rehoused. We've been consistently let down over the years, our voice hasn't been listened to. The general sentiment is gross mistrust in the whole establishment. Please, if you allow me, there are four people outside, they are survivors, they didn't allow them to come in. Please can you let them in, please? CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I hadn't prepared to say anything that evening, but the atmosphere was so charged. I looked across, I looked at the council chamber, I saw people who I believed were involved in the culture that had possibly allowed the fire to happen. We have been telling this council explicitly how you were treating us, how you were putting our lives at risk, how you were treating us with contempt. If you honestly believe that you have the legitimacy after everything you have heard here tonight, after everything that's happened in North Kensington over the past few weeks, you need to seriously reconsider because I'll tell you one thing, the wounds that have been created in North Kensington are not going to heal as long as YOU are ignorant enough to believe that you have the right to rule over us! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE The scale of the anger, the depth of the mistrust... You can't solve immediately. That council meeting was the first day of trying to say, "No, "it isn't business as usual, we've changed." You know, if you can't change after an incident like Grenfell, when are you ever going to change? This is a new leadership team. I'm appointing Kim Taylor-Smith as my deputy. Kim is going to make sure we find homes for all those who lost theirs in the fire. First of all, I just want to introduce myself, I'm Kim Taylor-Smith... ..and I'm a week in the job... PEOPLE SHOUT OUT QUESTIONS VOICEOVER: When I took this job on as deputy leader, one of my brothers said to me, he said, "Look, Kim, just remember..." He said, "The book has been written. "And the book is the failure of the council." And he said, "Don't even think about changing that book because it will "always be the failure of the council." And he said, "But if you're going to take this job on, "what you've got to think about is writing the second volume." Somebody needs to step up and somebody needs to take on this chance. My first task is to deal with the 380 people who are currently sitting in a hotel. But can I just say, there's going to have to be a queue here. VOICEOVER: I've always had a policy of being very frank and open. The one thing my wife always says to me in the morning, you know, is she says to me, "Kim, do up your flies and don't talk like a businessman." You know, because my background before becoming a councillor was a businessman. You can shout as much as you like, you can shout as much as you like. Shouting is not going to help. You're not answering my question. You can keep going like this at me, you can keep going like this, but I am trying to give you some answers. Sit down! You're saying, "Yap, yap, yap, you're very tired." That gentleman has lost his child. I know that each and every one of you are trying but can you understand how that appears? I remember most of the council meetings only because just the disconnect between the people that I grew up with and the people that are sitting on the other side of the table who were you know, who were tasked to, I don't know, take care of the community. Hello. This ain't right. This ain't right. Hello? I've taken on the job to try and find homes for the people. How's it going? How's it going? How's it going? Slowly. It's going slowly because we are running at the pace of the individuals. We've... MAN SHOUTS DISAPPROVAL I'm... DISQUIET CONTINUES People in the community and the council, there is that sense, I think, that... ..people are speaking different languages. They're speaking English but they're speaking different versions of English. I'm going into the flat tomorrow. What do you expect to find? God knows. And as it's getting closer, I'm getting more... It's awful that the tower is still there and looms over the entire community. If I feel dodgy, then I will just turn around and walk back down again, because people died on them stairs. Some people felt a need to go back and see their homes, maybe look for possessions that may have survived and also just, I suppose... ..one never gets closure, but to see their home for the last time. I've been up them stairs, it must be 5 million times over the years, and all you could see was blackened smoke. There used to be a railing all the way up the middle and that used to be bright red - all the paint had come off that. Anyway, we've got to my landing, the police have opened the door, well... ..I walked in... ..and it looked like something out of World War II. I looked into the kitchen... ..and I said to the police, "I've had enough." I said, "I've had enough, I've got to get out." I'll never forget it. And I wish I hadn't have done it. I wanted to go in to say goodbye, but then now I wish I hadn't. I had a lot of memories there. SHE SOBS For three months, my uncle was still technically missing. When we were finally told that he was identified, we went to go and meet the coroner. She was like, "Look, I can tell you that he was identified in his flat "and we have managed to... "He was found all in one piece," like altogether, and we could have him that day. And for us, you know, that was like... "Wow!" You know? It was the best news to hear in the most horrific situation. It was a very long, agonising wait. And when it comes, it's... It kind of hits you really hard. They kept coming one by one and every time they told us about one... ..it just felt like a knife going through you each time. You're being stabbed again and again. Nadia had worked here for ten years. Gentle, kind, a genuine lady who really cared. So the feeling that Nadia had died was immense, really, with children and parents. She had three daughters. The oldest being Mierna, who had been our deputy head girl. The middle child was Fatima, about to finish and go to secondary school. They always dressed up for World Book Day. Mierna dressed as Handa from Handa's Surprise. And this is Fatima as the Tiger Who Came To Tea. This is Zainab, Nadia's youngest daughter, who'd actually just started nursery a few weeks before the fire. "She'd played with the Play-Doh, "explored the outside area holding her grandma's hand. "On the first morning at nursery she didn't want to leave "and asked Grandma to stay a little longer." # Allahu Akbar. Allah. # Specialist teams have spent the past five months sifting through debris on every floor of the building in west London. Police believe they have now found and identified the bodies of everyone who died in the Grenfell Tower fire. They've put the final number of victims at 71. THEY SING: How Great Thou Art Khadija, we will love you and miss you and talk about you forever. And may the blessing of God... I think everybody's conscious that this is an individual tragedy, but it's also a shared community tragedy as well and therefore every death, every funeral, has that backdrop of all the others who are suffering from this tragedy at the same time. And that gives it a much wider dimension. Right, are you guys ready? Let's go, guys. We went from a couple of hundred on the first march to about 500 on the third. And the six-month anniversary came quicker than ever, and we had about 2,500 people on the streets. The silent march allows us to mourn. It tends to be some form of therapy to a lot of people as well. The more people you speak to, the more you realise how many people are suffering - the direct survivors and the bereaved, to the surrounding community. INDISTINCT SHOUTING The greatest thing that has had an impact for me, I believe, during the whole of this, is the time that after all the relief, after donations, we got together as a staff team, we all held hands, made everybody hold hands, we were in a big circle, and I wanted to thank everybody for their hard efforts and recognising that we've all had a traumatic time, not only the victims and the survivors, it's us as staff members. And then I got all kind of emotional and het up and... You see, I find it hard to talk about it now. But then we cried as a staff team. And then for me, at that present time, it just showed the impact that it could have on just normal people. And, um... Yeah. Wow, so many people. Thank you. VOICEOVER: My wife said, "Look, Karim, let's go away "for a little bit." We went to... ..like, a national park. I don't know what happened. I don't really remember much of it but I had like a big, um... ..like a breakdown, a big nervous breakdown. I was just overwhelmed. Still to this day, I do avoid the tower, I'll be honest with you. People on that night, those people I'll never get out my head. I remember shouting to a young kid, "You're going to be all right, don't worry." I never saw that kid again. Because he's got vascular dementia, Dad, he can't be left alone too long. He's already gone out around nine times. Someone actually spotted him crossing the road, which is like three lanes on each side, a big, big road. REPORTER: So far we have results in from 18 of London's 32 boroughs. Kensington and Chelsea remains Conservative, despite strong criticism of the council's response... We need to stick together. We need to be each other's strength. Whatever it takes to get justice, whatever it takes to make sure everybody's in homes, whatever it takes to make sure everybody's being looked after. We'll get together, we'll form our groups, we'll use our experience, our knowledge, our education, our resources. We will make things right. And that's how it feels right now. Pily loved fashion. Full of colours, totally flamboyant, but it was always her own style. She could have chosen anybody, really, I don't know why she chose me. But from when we got together, we were never apart. My wife never really recovered from the trauma of the fire. After seven months... ..my...my wife passed away. Justice, reparation, these words are really meaningless. It's about fundamental change. Grenfell can represent a turning point in history. A change in how society views communities that live in social housing, that, um, they are listened to and respected. Because, had we been listened to and respected at Grenfell, it would not have happened. It's as simple as that.
