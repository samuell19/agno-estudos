- Look, Henrik, you're a great guy, but this isn't working out for me anymore. I know you've been through a lot, but this just isn't what I signed up for. - Look, I understand that- - You need to get back out there. Look for a job, connect with people. I appreciate you buying me a plane ticket and all. Look, ask yourself this. If Norway is so great, why haven't you left Minneapolis and gone home in so long? Yeah, see that right there? That face, that's the problem. You just shut everyone out. If all Norwegians express their feelings like you do, your sister's wedding will feel more like a wake. - Okay. Completely reasonable. - One to go for Jessica Johnson. - Here. - That's me. Oh, um, actually, I. Oh. - Mm! I only drink chai tea. How do you not know that after all this time? - I did order a chai tea, right? - Um, you did, but that's hers. - Hello. - You're Jessica Johnson too? - I am. - Okay, that's weird. - Oddly enough, it is not. - I'll get you a new peppermint latte and your, your bakery items will be ready in just a minute. Do you still need that tea? - It doesn't look like it. Thanks anyway. - Yikes. - Poor guy. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm sorry for the mix up. - Oh! - Two Jessica Johnson's, what are the odds? - Higher than you think. It's a common name. There were actually two in my kindergarten class, that's when I started going by JJ. Let me help you. Oh! Oh no! - Oh! Can I? - No! No, please stop helping me, or whatever it is you're doing here. I'm recovering from a leg injury. Essentially I'm a mess. - Thank you. I teach high school students. You wanna talk chaos, drama, and messy breakups, you're not even in their league. - Can I buy you a second latte? Or technically a third one. - I have to get to school. It's just. I hope your day gets better. Merry Christmas. - Hey, JJ? S- sorry! I come bearing three gifts. - Uh, like one of the wise men? - Exactly. Except for the wise part. - Is it weird that you found me here? It feels borderline creepy. - There's only one high school, one block from the cafe. I definitely know your name, and a nice group of students pointed me to your classroom. - Fair enough. - First gift. To help you get through your afternoon. - Oh, bless you. - Second gift. That's the lemon poppy seed. - Ah. So I can have black things in my teeth all afternoon. - And give the students something to talk about. - Perfect. - Finally, I found one more. But I was thinking. If you were to change this negative into a positive, just one little line right here, then his answer would be right, and we could round this D up. What do you think? Could we give Wyatt here a C for Christmas? My day could really use the lift. - Well, technically the D was a gift. That better? - I feel happier already. - Okay. Hey, no one remembers 10th grade science. So you are either a physicist or a teacher yourself. - Just a guy who knows how to use the internet. Hey, you have a troll! - And? - It's from Bergen, Norway, like me. - How do you know that? - It's wearing the Bergen bunad. The bunad is a traditional Norwegian dress. Every region has their own. And your little guy is from Bergen. How did you get it? - It, um, was my grandmother's. She always had it on her nightstand. Did your grandmother love Norway? - I don't think so. She never went. - Really? - Really. - Hey, can I ask you something? What were you about to say earlier? - Sorry? - Outside of the cafe, you started to say something. - Oh, yeah. Not my circus. - I know, it's my circus. - Okay, you just sat there. She was rough. You didn't call her out on any of it. - No, she wasn't wrong. And I am in between jobs. - Okay. She didn't need to do it in public. Besides you got her a ticket to Norway. A smart move would've been to take the free ticket and then dump you. - You're right. What was she thinking? Hm? - Okay. Merry Christmas. - Aye yai yai. Stop doing that. - You could have the ticket, the extra plane ticket to Norway. It's in your name. You could spend Christmas in Bergen. - I can't pick up and go to Norway. - Do you have other holiday plans? - Not really. That is not the point. - Listen, this isn't some weird pickup move. The ticket is non-refundable. I'd just hate seeing it go to waste. We'd say goodbye at the Bergen airport and we won't even see each other for two weeks until we fly back. You have a troll from, from Bergen, it feels like fate. Uh, why are you shaking your head and not even considering? - Because I can't go to Norway with you. It is out of the question. - Why not? - One, you are a self-confirmed mess. Two, you're vaguely in between jobs, which I'm pretty sure means you're an international jewel thief. Three, I don't believe in fate. Four, I don't even know you. - You don't have to know me. All you have to do is sit next to me on the plane. I'll be asleep before, before we take off. What are, what are you doing? - Here's my number. My name is Henrik. Call me when you change your mind. Flight's tomorrow on KLM through Amsterdam. Back on January 2nd. I believe in fate. - Yeah, I still don't. - I know, but you're gonna love Bergen at Christmas. See you tomorrow. - Oh, no, you won't! Yes, I will. We'd love to have you over for Christmas dinner. Your lovely wife already messaged me and I confirmed. - So you're not taking the free ticket? - Go to Norway with a jewel thief? I don't even drive out to Lake Minnetonka, if I can help it. - Do you hear that? I'm making dad noises now when I sit down. Anyway, you should go to Norway. - You know I need to work on my dissertation. Which reminds me, I need one more extension. - JJ, I gave you one extension to care for your grandmother. Another extension to recover from her loss. But a third. - You've given three before to other people. Remember Larry, the guy who had two sets of twins? Besides, it's almost Christmas. I can't wrap up a dissertation in two weeks. - Well, you'll have to or reapply to the university and hope the admissions board accepts you again. - Merry Christmas, Bill. JJ, I've been more than fair. Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you've been focused on finishing it this semester or even working on it at all? Well, then my mind is made up. Unless, well, there is one way I might possibly consider giving you the extension. - Really? What way? - You take the ticket and go to Norway for Christmas. - Bill, I can't do that, you know I can't. - I know you think you can't. Serious question. Do you see any irony in the fact that your dissertation deals with the polar ice caps and yet you've never been anywhere near either pole? Do you know that Bergen is the birthplace of modern meteorology? Well, it is. I've always wanted to visit the university there and I've always wanted to see the northern lights. I'm gonna be a hundred years old when my last kid leaves home. I dunno when I'll get the chance. So go to Bergen, send some pictures, see what fate has in store for you, and then you can have your extension, final offer. And this takes precedence over Christmas dinner. Let me know what you decide. - You were there. Do you snore? Because I will elbow you if you snore. Also, I want the window seat. About that sign with the question mark. - Don't worry, we are in Bergen. That sign ignites much debate. Some people say it's art. Others say it's a questionable way to spend our taxes. I think it's just Norwegian humor. - You really did sleep the entire way. - It's my superpower. Did you get any rest? - No. - Why not? - Physics. The surface tension of my body holds up the plane. - That's an interesting theory. Have you tested it? - Yeah, of course. And the results are clear. If I stay tense on the plane, the plane doesn't crash. Cause and effect. So I am the reason you're alive. Now, will you please explain why I'm carrying all this duty-free wine? - Alcohol is very expensive here. So it's obligatory to stock up when you get through an airport. A national responsibility, really. - Okay, got it. I'm tired and there's my ride. So goodbye. - Wait, but may I recommend the Bybanen? - The B what? - The Bybanen. Our light rail train. It's significantly less expensive. - Can't argue with that. Okay, here you go. Enjoy your wine. Happy wedding. Merry Christmas. Thank you for the ticket. And I will see you back at the gate in two weeks. Good morning. - So maybe don't talk to people on the Bybanen. Actually, don't talk to people that you don't know. See those people? When social distancing became a thing and they told us how to stand two meters apart, Norwegians asked, "Why so close?" - That more Norwegian humor. - Attempted humor. - Mm. When was the last time you were home? Your girlfriend said it's been quite some time. - Not my girlfriend, but yes, it's been a minute. You know, officially there are seven hills around Bergen. There is a debate about that number. - Is there anything you guys do agree on? - Very little. But we all use the mountains to predict the weather. - How? - Very simple. If you can't see the top, it's because it's raining. If you can see the top, it will be raining soon. - Do you know that man? - Who? - Guy over there. He is staring at you. - No. - You didn't even look. - No, I don't know him. Here's our stop and it's a line, let's go. - Where's your sister? - Trust me, you will hear her coming. - Henrik! Ah-huh! Sis! - Oh! And you must be JJ! - Nice to meet you. - Welcome to Norway. I'm Nora. Hope you brought an umbrella. - Oh. - Oh, I like the look of you. I like that you're with Henrik. - Okay, clarification. I'm not with Henrik. I'm just helping him carry this wine. Soon as I give you these bags, I am going to my hotel. - Okay, very good. Where are you staying? - At The Viking. - Okay. - What? What, what's wrong with the Viking? - Nothing. It's just far. I'll tell you what. Come to my soon-to-be stepdaughter's Christmas show. It's right down the street. And after, I'll drive you to The Viking. - I don't wanna intrude. I can just get a taxi. - Yes, you could, but you're in Norway at Christmas and this is a St. Lucia show. If you haven't seen it, you should. Oh, you have to come, she has been practicing for weeks. She has a solo. - Oh. Ah! After that you will take me to the hotel? - And after that I will take you to the hotel. But we have to hurry, we're late. Come on! Limp faster! - You said Norwegians are reserved. - I know. Nora lived in Spain for three years. It did her irreparable damage. - Definitely is not what we agreed on. - I know my sister is a tornado, but it's a cute show. And my niece, Mia, is adorable. A taste of Norwegian culture. Please come with us. - Hi! - Hi! Good to see you. - Marc, this is JJ. Marc, my fiance- - Hi, hi. - And Mia's mom, Sara. - Hi! - St. Lucia legends started in Italy, but Norway adopted her and we put our own spin on it. - That's Mia, at the front in the center. - She's adorable. - I haven't seen her in two years, since they came to visit me in Switzerland. - What were you doing in Switzerland? - Working. - A lot of priceless art in Switzerland. Not anymore. ♪ St. Lucia ♪ St. Lucia - Go, Mia! That was very cute. - Mia was the best, of course. - Of course. Uncle Henrik! - That's a JJ. - Hi, Mia. You were so good. - I'm learning English now and you're horrible. I'm coming back. Save me that seat next to you. - Okay, but you can leave those here. Aw! - I know. - So how long have you and Henrik been together? - Oh, we're not together. I just have the same name as his ex-girlfriend, so I took her plane ticket. That's it. - How did you meet - Mm, at a cafe. He took my order, then he spilled my coffee. Then he proceeded to knock my tests all over the sidewalk, and then he barged into my classroom. - Barged! - He is something. - Totally own brand. This is why no one really likes Henrik. - I like him. - Doesn't count. You like everyone. - So where you staying while you're in town? - Oh, at The Viking. You all make the same face when I mention The Viking. - I have an absolutely brilliant idea. You can stay with our grandmother. She lives in an adorable house only a few blocks from our dad's house where Henrik will be, even though you don't like him. - Ah. - And she's in. You are welcome to stay. - Hang on. - Wait, wait, wait. You just texted our grandmother and she responded? The same grandmother that has never figured out her remote. - Our grandmother has entered the digital age. - Hang on, please. You are all very kind, but I don't even know her. - Just think of it as staying in a B&B. And she has screaming-fast wifi. - Okay, so Henrik told me not to talk to people here, and said that Norwegians can be slow to warm to you. And now you are inviting me to stay with a stranger? - Tell her. - Okay. Well, the truth is, The Viking is up a steep drive. It has no public transportation. - It routinely fails health inspections. - And the power goes out a lot. - What's your grandmother's name? You're sure you don't want dinner? - So sure. Just a pillow. Okay, how much should I be paying your grandmother? - Paying? - Paying, yeah. Nora said to think of it as a bed and breakfast situation. - Yes, my grandmother has a bed and breakfast in the morning. How do you feel about asbabal? - Mm, dubious, but admittedly a little curious. Henrik, I don't feel right about staying here for free. - Find a way to feel right about it. My grandmother will be insulted if you even suggest paying her. Don't your feet get cold? - Oh, a little. - You got old. - You didn't. This is JJ. JJ, Astrid, my bestemor. - It's nice to meet you. Thank you so much for letting me stay with you. - Are you hungry? - I'm okay. Thank you. - JJ just wants to crash. She can't sleep on planes, like some people we know. - Probably because she has thoughts in her head, unlike some people we know. You will show her to the front bedroom. - Mm! - Come down to breakfast in the morning. - Thank you so much. - Good night. Are you sure she's okay with me being here? - I'm sure. That is one delighted Norwegian in the living room. Besides, look, she's got you covered. - Oh. Great, somewhere for me to work. Okay, first question. What did you call Astrid? - My bestemor. Grandmother. It literally translates to best mother. - Hm, I love that. Second question. Why are there two duvets on the bed like that, instead of one big one? - That right there is the secret to happy Norwegian marriages. Everyone gets their own duvet. - Genius. - All right, sleep well. - Matching duvets. They should call 'em two-vets. Stop doing that. - You made a joke. - A little one. - No, that was solid Norwegian humor. Not even one day in Bergen and you're getting funnier. - Be gone. - I'm going. But you know I'm right. - Go. - Know I'm right. - Good morning, Astrid. I had every intention of helping with breakfast, but your guest room is so cozy and it was still so dark, I think my brain outvoted my body. - Yes, this time of year the sun doesn't join us until almost 10:00. - Thank you. - Have you had brunost before? Brown cheese? - No, I have not. - It is a mixture of goat milk and cow milk. - Hmm. Hm. Mm! - It's an acquired taste. - Um, Astrid, could you help me with this? Apparently my grandmother visited Norway and bought this troll. I didn't even know it was from Bergen until Henrik recognized the, um, ba boo? - Bunad? - Bunad, yes, yes! It was special to my grandmother, so I wanna track down where it's from, even though it has been many decades. - And you can no longer ask her? I see. - As far as I know, she didn't travel. And our big vacation every summer was renting a cabin on the Lacs Lake. When I asked her about the troll, she just brushed me off. Oh, that is beautiful. - It's a krumkake. Please, come try. Just pour in a little. So you want to find out why your grandmother was here, if you can? - Exactly. - Oh, trolls are more for tourists than local, so I recommend starting in Bryggen. - Bryggen? That's a store, or? - Bryggen is a shopping street. - Oh! - Go out my door, take a right, head down the hill until you see water. Bryggen will be right there at the harbor. - Thank you. - Okay, get ready. Oh, there, you got it! - Thank you. - Now roll it. - Mm-hmm. Very good. - All right. - Uh, two down. - And how many to go? - 198. Oh! I thought you're serious. - Hmm. Most of our merchandise is made in bulk. This is hand-carved. - Any idea where else to try? - There are a few carvers in town you could ask. There is always one at the Christmas market, for sure. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Hi! - How's the troll-hunting? - Yeah, not great. That was my third shop and still no luck. Want to see something cool? These were waiting on my shoes this morning and I can confirm my toes are quite toasty. - Oh, she really likes you. - Oh! - Those are hand-made. - Well, I like Astrid too. I'm gonna go shopping for some socks of my own so I can return these to her. - No? - No. Yeah, you can buy more but do not give those back. That's a gift to wear forever. Like you should plan to be buried in those socks. - I'll add it to my will. - "Hello, Henrik. This is Astrid, your grandmother texting you. You'll buy food for dinner." - I kind of adore her. Man is staring at you. - No, he isn't. - Yes, he is. Think he just took your picture. Did you steal a Picasso from him by any chance? - Actually, I think it was a Monet. Come, we need to buy food for our dinner. - Our? - Dinner is at my grandmother's where you'll be staying. So you're invited and I want you to meet my father. His name is Johan. - I feel like I'm crashing your family time. - Don't be weird. - Can't make that promise. You see everything you need there, Henrik? - So who is Bill? - If you really wanna know, he is the barista at the cafe, checking up on us. - Seriously? - No. Bill is my department chair. - At the high school. - At the University of Minnesota. I'm finishing my PhD there. I was only substitute teaching this semester. Bill has always wanted to come to Norway. He's got a bunch of kids, so it's not really in the cards for him right now. - So you're sending him pictures. That's so kind. - Actually, I'm kind of mad at him. Let's walk. - What do you mean? - It's a long story. - We have a long walk. - We do? - No, but it's uphill, so let's hear more about Bill. - What did he say? - Don't worry about it. - Was that related to the people that were staring at you? - Yes. - You wanna tell me about it? - No. - I told you about Bill. - Not the same. - Well, since Astrid has screaming-fast wifi, maybe I could just Google you when I get back. - Please don't. It won't make any sense to you out of context. I'll tell you when we get back, I promise. - Okay. - Thank you. - And she made me wait five days before she said yes. - I was waiting on his background check to clear. - Is it customary to have a wedding so close to Christmas? - No, that is Henrik's fault. - Marc and I were supposed to get married over a year ago, but his leg injury sidelined him. - So we've been postponing and postponing until he was well enough to travel. - Okay, so the wedding is on the 23rd? - Mm-hmm. - And then do I have this right, you celebrate the holiday on Christmas Eve? - We begin celebrating on Christmas Eve, but we continue all week. - By the 26th we're kind of over it, but we start right after Thanksgiving, which is great because I love Christmas. What's funny? - The word love. It just reminded us. We were discussing last night how hard English is for your word love. - What's hard about love? - You use the same word for everything. You love chocolate, you love your friends. - You love those shoes in the store window. You love the same man you've been married to for 30 years. - Okay. - So in Norway we have different kinds of words for different kinds of love. - Yeah. I-if I love Taylor Swift's music, I would say, Taylor Swift. What? I'm a Swifty. I mean, who isn't? - If, uh, I wanted to tell a friend I love them, I would say. - And what about your partner? - We have a third way. You would say, but that's very special. People don't say it often. - Some people don't say it at all. - I said it once. I'll let you know if anything changes. - So how long have you and Henrik been dating? - Oh, we're not dating. I have the same name as his ex-girlfriend, Jessica Johnson. So when they broke up, he gave me her plane ticket. - You and Jessie were dating? - No, we weren't dating. - What? I literally watched her break up with you. - No, you watched her quit. She was my assistant. I hired her to run errands, drive me to PT. You heard her finally get sick of me and resign. - You let me believe that she was your girlfriend. That's it, I take it back. I no longer like this man at all. - To my, uh, persistently disagreeable little brother. - Da! Skol! - Okay, JJ, it's time for you to try my grandmother's favorite, so you can see the dark side of life in Norway. - Is that black licorice? - Mm! - Covered in salt, JJ. - Be afraid. - Go big. Or go home. Mm. - It's an acquired taste? Mm-hmm. - Okay, it's time to settle this. Ooh! - JJ, this is julebrus, Christmas soda. Every region in Norway makes their own. - And there's great debate in this family as to which is the best one. - There's no debate. There's Hansa julebrus from Bergen, and then there are the lesser versions. - Okay, so we're taste-testing? - We are, and they will be proven wrong. The best is EC Dahls from Trondheim. My stomping ground. - Okay, first one, let's go. Skol! - Oh! Mm. - Acceptable. But it's not Hansa. - Are you sure? - That is definitely Hansa. - Mm-mm. Get ready for the next one! Skol! - Oh yeah, quality. Hansa. Hansa 100%. - Is it? - That is almost undrinkable. - It's Hansa. I agree. I agree. You are undrinkable. - The university isn't far. I wanna go take a picture for Bill. He says Bergen is the birthplace of modern weather forecasting. I can come with you if you want. - Yeah, thank you. What exactly are you trying on in there? - My suit. I've grown a bit over the years on muscle, of course. I needed some alterations for the wedding. I wanted to try it on. What do you think. It's okay, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. All good. Is that for Bill? - No. - So what does one do with a meteorology degree? - Lots of stuff, actually. At first I wanted to be on the news. Good evening, I'm Jessica Johnson. A sudden cold air mass from the Arctic will create a weather whiplash, dropping temperatures down below zero overnight. Oh, who am I kidding? This is Norway, you guys are gonna go outside no matter what. - You're a natural. - Oh, well, thank you. After that, my plan sort of shifted to research. My paper is titled, "Assessing outcomes of stratospheric aerosol injections in the polar regions." - You lost me at outcomes. Oh. I just don't know if research is my calling. I subbed high school physics last semester. I was grieving the loss of my grandmother, so at first it gave me a reason to get up every morning. Turns out I really enjoyed it. - Ah! Sorry. - Come here. Tell me about those boys. - You are right, I'm a thief. But I didn't steal paintings or jewelry, I stole Bergen's dreams. They say most Norwegians are born wearing skis. I was no exception. A lot of people here prefer cross country skiing. Not me. Downhill as fast as I could. - Adrenaline. - Adrenaline. I was really good as a junior. So much promise. My plan, no, the whole town's plan was to bring Olympic gold home to Bergen. - So what happened? - I finished sixth in the super-G. The heartbreaker in the downhill, I missed the bronze medal by four hundredths of a second. - I mean still, that is actually amazing. - But not a medal. Yes, I know how that sounds. So I trained harder and harder and I knew I would get another shot at it. - I feel like this is the part that explains the limping. - I was at the World Cup leading after the first round. There was a big jump at the end. I lost control going 130 kilometers an hour. It was an epic wipe-out. A lot of, a lot of people thought I wasn't going to make it. I've never even watched the video. Anyway, my leg was the worst injury. Pins, rods, blades. I've been in the states for almost two years, seeing specialists, recovering. Now there's all this pressure to climb my way back, but my leg will never be that strong again. And my head's not there. I'm letting everyone down. I'm dreading bumping into my old coach. Anders. Or anyone from my old team. My leg won't support me running from them with pitch forks and torches. - Thank you for telling me. - I dunno what I'm going to do with myself. Downhill racing is all I know. - Well, have you ever considered a career modeling traditional Norwegian couture? - Ah! "Hello, Henrik. This is Astrid, your grandmother texting you. You and JJ will bring home the Christmas tree today." - I appreciate her thoroughness. Let's get her a tree. And then I need to get to work on my paper. Come on. This one's nice. Hmm. - Not a great crown. I have to admit, I'm a little disillusioned. - Oh, about our trees? - No, no. I just thought we'd trek up into the mountains and chop down our own. - Oh, those belong to our grandchildren and their children. Most of us buy them precut from farms. Hey, how about this one? - Hang on a sec. What could you tell me about this? - Oh, it's very old. I don't think this was done by a professional. Most carvers put initials or a symbol on the bottom perhaps, but there's nothing. I'm sorry. - Hi. - How is the paper coming along? - I'm making real progress. I'm also going slightly cross-eyed and I'm very vulnerable to an alternative offer. - Let's go. We call it morning gave. Morning gift. - Huh! - Brides and grooms give each other something on the morning of their wedding. Usually jewelry. - That is a very sweet tradition. - But Marc's not much of a jewelry guy, so probably not something for every day. He grew up on a farm, so he's practical, even by Norwegian standards. - What about something like this pocket watch? - That's very handsome. - It's nice because it's not an everyday piece of jewelry. - Yeah, you could tell him it's because you met him at exactly the right time. Oh, you're good. I have a big secret. - Huh! - I'm wearing my mother's wedding dress and I'm going to my final fitting. Want to keep me company? - So if Marc is from up north, how did you two meet? Because I dated the wrong guy first. - Him! - Oh yes, him. We all know him. Mine was from Barcelona. He was relentlessly passionate. "Nora, you are my life, my oxygen." But when I needed him. - Let me guess. Nowhere to be found. - Exactly. So I moved back to Norway, swore off men for the rest of my life. I took a job in Trondheim and promptly had a car accident. - Were you okay? - I was fine. Okay. Brace yourself. - Wow! - You're sure it's a wow dress? - It's a wow dress and you are a wow bride. - Thank you. So I ended up in hospital scared. I borrowed a phone from a nurse and I tried to text my dad, but in my craziness, I reversed two of the numbers and I got a "Who's this?" message back. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. I left a terribly sad feeling so sorry for myself message on a stranger's phone. I texted an apology, but no response. An hour later, this gorgeous man shows up with a soft blanket, a book, warm socks. And that was Marc. He stayed with me and then he drove me home. I thought, "If he's this kind to a stranger," right? I realized love is a verb. It's what you do, not what you say. Words are nice, but don't date a Norwegian man if you want to hear, "You are my oxygen." So have you noticed Henrik doesn't limp when he's with you? - He does. - I think he's healing inside and it's helping him on the outside. - Possibly. I just wish he felt better about being in Bergen. - Funny you mention that. - Three more on that row. - Yeah, three? - Mm. - Okay. - I got your text. Wait, what are you doing? - Astrid is teaching me how to knit. - And how's that going? - Well, I am making something vaguely sock-shaped. - She will learn. - I will learn. - Why do you need to go to Tretten? - Oh, uh, Nora asked me to run an errand there, but said it can be tricky to find. - Sure, I can walk you there now. - Yeah. Nora said the owner's giving them a really nice bottle of wine. She's gotta be five places at once, so I offered to pick it up for her. - My sister's pulling you into the wedding chaos. I knew that would happen. - Why, thank you. - You're welcome, JJ. Nora says nice things about you. - Aw. - They said Henrik Strom came back to Bergen, but I didn't believe them. - Don't worry, I'll handle this. Hey, guys, JJ was just about to leave. - She leaves when we say she leaves. - Henrik, it's time for you to pay for your decision. No! I mean pay, as in money. You owe everyone in here a drink. - At least one. Look at your face. Come on, we get it. You jacked up your leg. I don't blame you for calling it quits. - Well, Carl here does, but that's because he's deeply in need of therapy. Skiing is therapy. - Welcome to my bachelor party. It's two days until the wedding. Plenty of time to recover from tonight's damage. My dear. - Oh. - Thank you. You were impeccable. - Oh! - You knew? You were in on it? - I couldn't have done it without her. You wanna stick around and, uh, watch this unfold? - Absolutely not. No, I am going Christmas shopping and troll hunting. Have fun. - Thank you. - All right, the first round is on Henrik. - Yay! - And then the second round is on Henrik too! - Yay! - Brother, it's good to have you back. Yeah! It's not exactly great craftsmanship. - Yes, I agree. It, it looks like the work of a beginner. - There's no logo or anything. - Hmm. Look on this ridge, it. Does that look like three A's? - It does. Good eye! Okay, three A's. Does that ring any bells? - The carver community here in Bergen is quite small and I'd know of someone who used those initials. - But still, it's something. A clue. - Hm. - Thank you so much. - It's my pleasure. - I'm sorry. Do you speak English - A little. Can I help you with anything? - I'm okay, thank you. - Hm. - My name is JJ. Um. I'm a PhD candidate in Minnesota. I'm in Bergen for two weeks, so I just thought. - Would you like a tour? - Thank you. - You're welcome. So this is main campus and we'll go inside this way. They doing all kinds of cool research here, including- - You're gonna say jet stream studies, aren't you? - That is exactly what I'm gonna say. I told them about your work, and Bill, they wanna meet with you, maybe even discuss a sabbatical. - JJ. - I know, but come on. I think your kids would love it here. - Okay. I'll think about it. Oh, sounds like they're getting up early. Hmm, I usually get a half hour vacation in the mornings. It's 6:00 AM here. I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay. Bye. It's alive. It's alive. Oh! - Recovery was easier 10 years ago. - Mm, everything was easier 10 years ago. - That is undeniable. Thank you. - So do your teammates still love you? And I mean, the second kind of love, not the Taylor Swift music kind. - They do, especially after I spent enough on food and alcohol to purchase a small villa in France. I have to brave the grocery store. My grandmother is making a blotkake. It's a custom to bring cakes to wedding receptions. - Oh, that is a custom I fully endorse. - Mm. - Wait, do you also do wedding cakes too? - Yes. But not like you're thinking. It's a kransekake. It has stacked rings and the bride puts her hands- - Yeah. - Henrik. I heard you had come home. - This is JJ. JJ, Anders, my coach. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Please, uh, send my congratulations to your sister, huh? - I will. I was happy to hear that you're still coaching. - Oh, life is funny sometimes. - What is with you and chance meetings in coffee shops? On a positive note, he didn't have a pitchfork or a torch. - Anders is a good man, great skier. Even a better coach. He, uh, he's so calm, kind of zen. He always carries this little rune that he rubs when one of us is competing. He reached out to me over and over, but I ignored him. I, uh, I didn't know what to say. - I used to watch my grandmother bake. I wasn't much help, so I did the cleanup. - You don't speak of your mother. - She was sick as a child. It echoed through her whole life. She never should have had me, but I think she wanted to leave something behind, you know? She passed away when I was little. I like to believe I remember her. I think I do. Anyway, my grandmother took care of me and when the time came, I took care of her. - As it should be. - She was always there for me. - It sounds like you have a vacancy in your life. - Yeah, I guess I do. - Then I have decided. I am your bestemor now, if you'll have me. - Of course. Astrid, I have a new clue in my troll mystery. The wood carver at the Christmas market found three tiny initials. A A A. What? What does that mean? - An old friend who lives in Mount Floyen might know something. - Astrid. Please, come in. - Pedo Anders. Hi. So please, take a seat. Can I get you something to drink or? - No, thank you, Anders. This is JJ. - Oh yes, of course. Henrik introduced us this morning. Forgive me. - Oh, no worries. - So how can I help? I was intrigued by your cryptic message, Astrid. - I like texting. So JJ has been staying with me. Besides finishing her PhD and bringing Henrik back to life, she has been trying to solve a mystery. - Well, if I can help, by all means. - Okay, um, when I met Henrik, he commented on this little troll I keep on my desk. He said it was from Bergen. I told him it was impossible. It was my grandmother's dearest possession, and she hadn't been to Bergen. In fact, she hadn't traveled at all. - Hm. - But then I found a picture of her in Bergen. She passed away recently, so there's no way for me. I am sorry, that's a lot of information. - No, no, no. I'm, I'm, I'm following. So, are you trying to find out where she got the troll or why she came to Bergen? - Both. Astrid thinks you might know something. - This forest was your grandmother's favorite spot, which is why I carved her that troll from a piece of spruce that I found right over there. - So the three A's, that's you. - Anders Alf Anderson. My parents were a little, uh, dramatic. That was my first and last attempt at woodcarving. You must have so many questions. - Yeah, what was she doing in Bergen? - Well, her second cousin was here with two children and a third on the way, and she was on bedrest. So Florence had just finished high school, so she came over to help out. - And how did you two meet? Well, it was not love at first sight. No, I was biking across Rallarvegen, and Florence was out for a walk with the two children when the older one, who I think was maybe four years old, suddenly ran out right in front of my bike. - Oh no. - Yeah. So I swerved, I fell, of course. And then I made the mistake of yelling at her to look after her children better. - Oh! - That was, it was a miscalculation on my part. - She could be spicy. - She was magnificent. And before long we became inseparable. I felt it would last forever. But I had to leave for military service, which was mandatory back then. And Florence went home. So after that I competed around the world and by the time I got back to Bergen, her cousin had moved away. This was before the internet, of course. So I wrote some letters, but I never heard a reply. But I am happy that she had a good life. A granddaughter that she obviously loved so much. And I am delighted that she kept my troll for all those years. - Anders, when did my grandmother leave Bergen? - That is easy. I gave her the troll for Christmas. So she left on the 2nd of January, 1968. - My mother was born on July 15th, 1968. - I-I have a daughter? - She passed away many years ago. I'm the only one left. - But she, she was mine, yes? What was her name? Why did Florence never tell me? Wait, that, that means that you- - I can't answer questions right now. This is too much. Um. I'm sorry. I'm gonna walk back. - It's a long way. The vehicle is faster. - I wanna walk. - Where's JJ? Why wouldn't your grandmother tell coach? - Well, it was different times, right? 1968 in Minnesota. Being a single mom is hard, even more so back then. All the more reason to tell him. - Do you think he could be my grandfather? - Timing works. How would that feel for you? - I've gotten so used to the idea that I am alone. - Turns out I could have family right here in Bergen. It's crazy. - Or it's fate. - What's up? - I want you to put on your warmest clothing. - It's midnight. - Just do it and come outside. What are we doing here? It's beautiful, but my two-vet was extremely comfortable. - Just wait. - Some kind of Viking ritual. - Well, most Viking rituals involve large quantities of alcohol, which I have sworn off since last night. - Isn't your sister getting married later today? - At which time I'll be swearing back onto it. Look. Look, here they come. - The northern lights! - Seeing them in Bergen is like a Christmas gift. I checked the meteorology report and I saw there might be a show tonight. I wanted you to see it. - Thank you. - I thought since we're both feeling a bit lost, the lights might help us find our way. - How long can we stay? - As long as you want. - I'm having a wardrobe crisis. I didn't bring anything for a formal dinner, let alone a Christmas wedding. This is as good as I've got. Do you think Nora will kick me out? - No. But perhaps you would like to wear this instead? - Is this your bunad? - It was mine. But these past few years I believe it has shrunk in my closet. Closets can be tricky like that. - Maybe it will fit you? I will wear my mother's bunad. Most of us will wear traditional clothing for the ceremony. Then we change for dinner. - But is it okay for me to wear it? - Of course. - I mean culturally. I don't wanna act like I'm suddenly Norwegian and can wear a traditional dress. - It is fine. Perhaps you are suddenly Norwegian. - Is it kind of embarrassing that we're wearing the same outfit. Are you thinking about Mom? - Yeah. I do every day. - Look at you! - Eh! Group photo. Oh! - Come on. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. All of us! Come in here. - Oh! Oh! You look just like her. Beautiful. - Don't make cry already. We haven't even gotten to the church yet. What do you think? - What happens now? - Marc will arrive and then he'll propose to Nora. Propose? I thought it was a done deal. Do you mean this could still go south? - We'll see. - Come on. - Wow. What did I do to deserve you? Nora, will you marry me? - Hmm? Anything you'd like to add to that? - No. Uh, no, that pretty much sums it up. - Nora? Please say yes. - Should I? - Babe, yes or no. Any longer on this knee and I'll be walking like Henrik. Then by popular vote. Yes, I will marry you. Yay! - And in conclusion, as I said before, welcome Marc, we're glad you're here. Uh, uh. And we're glad you're family. And, and we're glad you're going to make Nora happy forever. Uh. I'm done. You can clap now. Skol! - Thank you, Papa. I can't keep climbing on chairs in these shoes. - We do this kissing thing back at home, but we tend to stay on ground level. - Norwegians like to add an element of danger to everything. It's in our Viking blood. - Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks, Papa. I knew my father would be hard to follow and I was right. I had a hard time following any of it. When Marc first approached me about marriage, I was flattered, but I couldn't do that to my sister. Then I found out that he wanted me to be his best man. So I was relieved. And if I'm being honest, just a bit disappointed. - Okay everybody, it's time. - There are 18 rings on the cake. The number of rings that break off predicts the number of children she'll have. - Eight! - Yeah, this cake is obviously defective. Everybody! Skol! - I'm so full from dinner, I don't have room for cake. - There's a rule with the cake table, you don't stop when you're full. You stop when you're ashamed. - Let me smell it. - I am stealing my brother for a dance. - But I haven't had any cake yet. - I'm sure there will be plenty leftover. - Save me some, okay? ♪ Raise your glass and drink to the fun, oh ♪ ♪ Now everyone just ♪ Ring out the bells ♪ Let's just keep the night rockin' ♪ ♪ 'Til Santa comes knockin' ♪ All around the world ♪ There'll be mistletoe kissin' ♪ ♪ Everyone's wishin' on a star leading the way ♪ ♪ From here to New Year's Day, let's celebrate ♪ - Oh, this is the most fun I've ever had at a wedding. And now you have another grandson. - Marc became my family the day he helped my Nora in the hospital. Just like you are my family now too. - I've never been a part of a big family before. I think I like it. - Bergen suits you. - Hm, you might be right. - Of course I'm right. - Thank you for solving my troll mystery and for taking me to see Anders. Thank you for not pressuring me to talk to him. - You will when you're ready. But we already know you have something in common with him. - What's that? - You both loved the same person. In a way that makes you family already. - In the interest of full disclosure, I think I'm falling in love with your grandson. - He's an acquired taste. - Do you believe in fate, Astrid? - Of course. - My mother's name was Andrea. I think she was named for you. - Who wants some more glug? - There it is. - Five o'clock. It's officially Christmas time. - Not quite. We're still missing one thing. Papa! - Now it's officially Christmas time! Ho, ho. - Everyone, we have a visitor. Everyone. - I brought some Christmas treats for everyone. - Oh, you're very kind. Please, sit. - Thank you. And I have something for you too, JJ. When Florence was here, she was learning how to knit but she wasn't very good. - Apparently that runs in the family. Yeah. So she, she didn't know how to stop. - Oh! - But she was too proud to ask for help. - Yes, that sounds exactly like her. - She gave this to me for Christmas and I've kept it all these years. And now I want to pass it along to her granddaughter. To our granddaughter. - Thank you, Anders. We don't know for sure that I am your granddaughter. - I wanted to speak about that. I mean, I am willing to take a DNA test if you want, but I don't need to. - I don't need one either. I choose you to be my grandfather. Aw. - It's settled. I am your bestefar. - You know what? I actually have a little something for you. Oh. - I think it's time for my grandmother's troll to come home. - Oh! Thank you. - Mm. - And now maybe it is time for you to come home too. It's the key to the downstairs apartment in my house. If you want to, you can stay there while you finish writing your dissertation. - That won't be necessary. JJ already has a home here in Bergen. - You are offering her a room, Astrid, I am offering her an entire apartment. - Are you including breakfast? - She makes a good point there, Anders. - Well, I-I am willing to negotiate breakfast. - Here she doesn't need a car. She can walk to town. - Yeah, from my house she can walk to a troll forest, and, and I can teach her how to ski. - Oh! - True. But if she lives here, you can still teach her to ski. - Henrik. May I have a word? - Now is a good time for everyone to clean my kitchen. Okay. You're getting the pots and pants. - Henrik. Henrik, Henrik! I have a gift for you also. - Coach, I don't think I deserve anything from you. - Who do you think is mad at you Henrik? Hmm? It's not me. It's not the team. It's not your family. We all respect your decision. The only person who's mad at you is you. Please. She gave it to me, you know. Florence. JJ's grandmother. You know when you, when you fell at the Cup, I- I can still see it when I close my eyes. I haven't retired because I have been waiting for you to come home, to join the coaching team, to take my place. - Coach, I- - There is no one that I would trust more, but I need you to trust yourself. - I watched the video of my fall at the World Cup after Anders left. - You did? - Yeah, it's all over TikTok. - Huh, there you go. There are all kinds of ways to become famous. - You know, I've been so consumed with my recovery, I never thought what that was like for my coach, to see that and then I shut him out. - Do you think that coaching would set things right for you? - I think it might. Like I'm repaying my debt to Bergen. Especially if the Norway men sweep all five golds at the next Olympics. - I know you'll do it. - But I have a bigger issue. I'm thinking of following a woman to Minnesota. - Oh, no! - It's a significant problem, right? - Yeah! And what if that woman was to stay here in Bergen, but she is rumored to have several housing options. - Staying in Bergen would be my first choice. - If I didn't know better, I would say that this is starting to feel like fate. - It's a good thing you don't believe in fate. - Good thing. What's this? - For Christmas. - But you already gave me socks. - Consider this a bonus gift. It's the northern light crystal. In case you ever feel lost again, you'll know where home is and how much you are loved. - Which kind of love are we talking about? - The third kind. - Oh! - Of course. - And you will advise me if that ever changes. - You'll be the first to know. - Ha! This man is about to kiss me. And trust me, it is going to be a top shelf kiss and I don't need you boys messing it up. Furthermore, you are looking at a new coach of the Norway National Mountain- - Alpine. - Norway National Alpine Ski team. And if you ever wanna have a prayer of joining that team, you better shape up. - Sorry, coach. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. That was impressive. - Teaching high school does give you a certain skillset. - Hm. - He called you coach. - He did. - You heard that? - I did. But more importantly, I also heard talk of a kiss.
