And God said: "It is not good that Man be alone. I will make him a helper". And God put Adam to sleep. He took one of his ribs. And from the rib, God made a woman and brought her to the man. Adam said, "She is my bone and my flesh. She shall be called Woman, for she will be the mother of Man". A man shall cleave unto his wife and be as one flesh. The ring will remind you of your fidelity to each other, the continuation of the love that binds you today. You shall be true to each other in sorrow and joy. Antoine Pont, do you take as your lawful wife, according to our Holy Church, Thérèse Maye? Yes, I do. Thérèse Maye, do you take as your lawful husband, according to our Holy Church, Antoine Pont? Yes, I do. Join hands in perfect union until death do you part. Antoine! I'm coming! A big change for you. I'll manage. You'd better because someday... you'll take my place. You're hard as a rock. Come here. Hold it like this. Then you cut. See! - Can you manage? - Of course. Try then. Go on! Hold it firmly! Is your sister satisfied with her bathroom? She doesn't use it. Out of spite. She'll end up using it though. Hey! One of my cows went back down. Who's that, Séraphin? That's Plan... with his sheep. You'll meet him soon enough. Séraphin! Antoine! Thérèse! I'll eat you up! Why won't you eat? I don't know. I'm not hungry. I know. It's because he's not here. I was married too. Your father was away in the summer too. We're all widows two months of the year. That's not it. That's not it? What then? I don't know. You don't know? I feel sick. Sick? And I feel dizzy. Since when? Since today. No period? Yes. If it's that, it's a good sickness! He doesn't know, right? He'll be surprised. A place to take... Someone should... We have to go down. Wait! Thérèse! So? So. What's wrong? It's not me. Who then? My mother. She says we're too poor to have kids. - She says we need money. - I can work. But I can't find work here with my job. We could leave, see the land. It's you I want... ...to see! No! You see? You light it with this. You're bored. Yet you just got here. As if you'll never see her again. Are you bored with me? Not at all. But if you want to go back down... you can spend Sunday with her. And you? Me? Don't worry. I'm used to it. I can always manage. If you come back here, you won't be alone. Unless I don't matter. On Saturday then? Only three days to go. He's at it again. Who, Plan? No, the Devil! Didn't you hear the last few nights? You sleep well. You don't know about our neighbour. Don't you know what they say? That he lives up there on the glacier with his wife and children. But sometimes he gets bored, so he tells them to take quoits at the Pin, you know, the Devil's Quoit Pin. A game they play. They toss their quoits, beautiful quoits of precious stones, transparent blue and green! But sometimes they miss the pin. Guess where they go? What's beyond? Nothing. A sheer drop. The stones tumble down. Sometimes we see them fall in the moonlight. - We're leaving. - Because of the Devil? No, I mean Thérèse and me. Why? For my job. I have no family here... Apart from you, you're like a father to me. You could have been. What do you mean? My mother said he was from up there. Is that all she said? Besides, "up there" is a big place. - What's wrong with you? - Me? Nothing. Nothing. No need to know... to love. Your mother... We'll talk about it tomorrow. If you know anything about my father, tell me! Go to sleep. I want to know, Séraphin! You must tell me! Séraphin! The mountain is evil! It is evil! Loutre! Biolla! Biolla! Are you asleep? Mummy! There you are! - Did you hear? - What? My bed! The herd! - Donneloye, look out! - Hold on! The girl! Loutre! Come with me! What's going on? Wait for me! Mummy, is it the end of the world? What is it? A storm? We'd see the streaks. - What streaks? - Of lightning! You come here! It's an earthquake! My bed shook! - So did mine! - Yes, we know! Mine too. Come, my lord, come. Come to bed. It's wide enough to sleep sideways. Come close to me. You smell of mountain. You smell of smoke. Come close to me all the same because I'm lonely and cold. Sit here. But I forbid you to touch me. I have to talk to you first, it's a secret. Don't tell anyone. Do you promise? Don't touch me. That's forbidden, my Lord. Just a kiss. Where? - On the lips. - No. I have something to tell you. Turn your head, you won't sting me, and I'll have you ear... close to my lips. It's because of the secret, Antoine. What is it? Money? A visit? What if he doesn't want the child? He'll want it. What if he thinks I'm ugly? What if he leaves me? Justin! Hey, Justin! Are you asleep? Put on your trousers and come with me. - Where to? - You'll see. Don't tell anyone. All right. Let them sleep a bit longer. Ready? It's Barthélémy! - Let us do it! - Buzz off! We must carry him. Go get a... He's gone. I'll get it. Don't fret about Marie... Don't fret about Marie A pretty girl is she - Do you hear anything? - No, I don't. You should hear something. - The stream? - Yes. Is it dammed up? Just take a look. You think the mist is gathering? No, the mist is lifting. Now take a good look. Dzozet! Catch him! And tell the Mayor the Diablerets have fallen! On Derborence. I can't go on. Come on. There! Water! Barthélémy, we're almost there. Jesus! A ghost! Nendaz! - Look... - Who is it? It's Barthélémy. He's dying. Barthélémy... Barthélémy! Hey! It's me. Maurice Nendaz. Can you hear me? Barthélémy! What about the others? Where are all the others? We haven't seen anyone else. Was Antoine up there? He's not at Zamperon. The mountain is evil! All-powerful! Thérèse! The mountain. The mountain! The mountain! Tragedy. What is it? A big rockslide. What are you talking about? On Derborence. That can't be. Rebord. Rebord! Rebord... It's on Derborence! So what? A big rockslide. Séraphin? We don't know. Antoine? We don't know. I know nothing. Barthélémy! Oh no! Barthélémy... It can't be. Not him. Barthélémy, do you hear me? It's me. Marie. Your wife. You can't leave us. Oh my God... He won't leave us. Tell me! All of you! Tell me! Barthélémy... Answer me! Talk! Talk! You can't leave us! Come on. Barthélémy. Come on, talk. Tell me. Who hurt you? You can tell me. You won't? What's that? Get the priest! You'll catch a cold. You need to be careful in your condition. You'd better stay in bed this morning. It's safer. What's wrong, Mummy? Barthélémy's wife... her baby is sick. - I'll get dressed. - No. You'd better not... Who's dead? My God! Marie's baby! Of course. It must be her baby. The poor woman. He wasn't sick. A sudden illness. She was frantic. As if we could do something about it. You're hiding something from me. I'm going out. Oh God, Thérèse. Don't you know? She doesn't know. A big rockslide. From where? The Diablerets. Where did it fall? On Derborence. The mountain? But mountains don't just come tumbling down like this. Where is Antoine? Oh! Antoine, my husband. Can a mountain come tumbling down? You make me laugh. If that can happen, what will become of us? Please, Thérèse. Leave me alone. We don't know anything, we have to wait. Wait? - And for how long? - One or two days. No, I want to go up. What good will you be up there? My poor girl, you must wait. Like us. What can we do? Really? And you must think of him. Him? Who? The baby. If he is born. And if I have a baby... If I have Antoine's baby... Antoine will never come back. And then the baby will be an orphan. Fatherless like me. An orphan, like Antoine before his own birth. He'd have been happy, Antoine. I'd have whispered it to him. He'll never know. Never. That's odd. I don't want it. I don't want it. Is a fatherless child still a child? Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away! Make it go away! Thérèse! Hans, look out! What a tragedy. Did anyone survive? Not a soul. And the herds? Not an animal left. Not one. We've come to help you. We can manage alone. And they don't need anyone any more. Rocks bigger than our houses have stopped the stream. So, who could have survived that? How many are missing? Nineteen. Fifteen from Premier, four from Aire. Not counting the widows and orphans. Almost three months. Right? He'll come before you know it. I'm weak now. Nonsense, Thérèse! Let's see... You've got good, strong legs. You can keep on working, my dear. You're fine. Call me when he comes. My God... What will become of us? He is faithful to me, at least. Dia... Devil! Diablerets! No one? No one left? Oh, you think so! Me, I can see! You understand me. You know how it happens. I know. You know. You do it by letting him push you. But him, the one who pushes you, you know him. You hear, like I do, all those he keeps as prisoners, who despair and moan. They have shapes but nothing inside. Empty shells. And they make a noise... at night. I too exist. I was trapped. And I freed myself. It's me. Antoine Pont. Where are you? Listen... The mountain fell on me. That makes you laugh? It makes me laugh too. And that's Zamperon. Hey! - Hey! - Mummy! Mummy! I know you. No one here? Hello anyway. So! There's Thérèse. We waited for you. She's fallen! Hey, woman! What is it? Thérèse, is that you? Shut up! Yes, it's me. It's him, and it's not him. What are you talking about? They say Plan hears them at night. Because they're alive, yet not alive. Come on... But everyone has said one every Sunday for your poor husband. Anyway, ghosts don't exist, do they? Quiet! They need us. Maybe one of them misses me. Come on, Thérèse... I did see... What exactly? Him. I'll go, and if I find something, I'll tell you. Then we'll know. I came here last night already. For nothing. For nothing at all. It's further on. He appeared near the field, she says. It's nonsense. Probably, but she's a woman, and I promised. Nonsense, I say. Come and see! Someone slept here last night. Come and see. It's just as I found it. What's this? - I don't know. - So... Who could it be? Well, you never know... There's a prowler around. You! Stay here! Don't go! - He slept at Udry's. - Don't go! Rebord! Rebord, don't go, I said. Rebord's taken his rifle. He's after him, he says he's a thief. But that's not true. I saw him. It's Antoine. My Antoine? You saw him? Him? Take me there. Straight away. There! Rebord! Rebord! - Wait! - Did you see him? No! There! He's gone. There now! A man slept in my haymow. Who is that over there? The dead! They're coming back. We can't stop them! Look! The priest! He's coming at us! You're mad. You'll kill a man. It's him! I'm sure of it. I wasn't sure yesterday, but now I am. I want to see him. Let me go! Antoine. Wait, Thérèse! We're not sure. Antoine... Is it you? And you? Is it you? Antoine. What a small face I have. No bigger than a fist. I look awful. It's not surprising. Two months in a cellar. Rebord tried to shoot me. Antoine... Is this your missal? Antoine... is it really you? Touch me. This is skin and flesh. Feel! It's not a vision. It's solid, it's me. Can it be true? The brooch I gave you. It's the ghost! I recognised him! Fruit. It's good. Listen... I have a surprise for you. A good surprise. My work. Left unfinished. I was up there. Away from you. The mayor wants to talk to Antoine. Antoine, listen to me. The mayor? I have to go. Where's my jacket? Is this really Antoine Pont? The real Antoine? He's skinnier... thinner... Tell me... how'd you get out? Wait, I'm still all mixed up. Where am I? I'm out of there... and you're here. And me? All right... What day is it today? We have to count. Count for me. How long was it? Over eight weeks. Almost nine. That can't be. You lose track of days. He was there. Then he was gone. The mountain. Did you hear the rockslide this far? We didn't know what it was. It was like a storm but with clear skies. But I suspected it. Because I thought to myself, it could be something else. We're not alone. I'm pregnant. If you hadn't come back, he might have been fatherless like you. Dear Antoine. I must go to her. - She can wait. - Stay with us. - It's him! - He looks thinner. There he is. There! Look! Joseph! There he is! - Over there. - Wait. Let's go over there. Treat us to some food. We're kind enough to buy drinks here... Antoine! Is it you? - It can't be! - Quiet! At first, I was on the ground, lying still. I didn't know if I could move. I didn't want to move. Then it was if someone called to me. Yes. He said, "Where are you?" I said, "Here". That's all. First, I moved the fingers on my right hand, then my hand, then my arm up to the elbow, then my whole arm. I thought, "I have one arm. Good. Let's see the other one". So, with my right arm, I paid a visit to the left one. Let him finish. Antoine, have a drink. Can't wait to sell your plonk, eh? Hi, Antoine! You're here, too? Then came my legs... both in good shape. I found out... by moving my knees like a newborn baby whose nappy has just come off. Let him talk. Then I thought, "Was a voice calling me?" It had stopped. I'm telling you, it's the Devil! Shut up! I began yelling, as if someone could hear me. Air came in between the rocks. Send him out! And water? Don't rush me. Isn't air our first need? - Before bread and water? - Well, that's right. I followed a crack, a dead end. I had to go back. I was glad when it went up because up means out. But... when it went down... I was discouraged. To your health, Antoine. You're safe now. Long live Antoine! I was thirsty. My mouth was parched. Suddenly, trickling water! Glacier water was seeping through the stones. Then I had everything. I was saved. And here I am. Well, since you're here, cheers! There's someone I'd forgotten about. He's alive! When the mountain came down... my fault. - He wanted to tell me about my father. - It's the wine. Séraphin, I know! He's alive. He called to me. Listen, Antoine... you're tired. We'll talk about that another time, if that's OK. We just have to go and get him. We just have to go and get him. We just have to go and get him. He's alive, I'm telling you! A friend and much more! Without him, I couldn't have gotten married. He's alive. He said, "Hey, Antoine!" He's up there. We'll just go and get him, just go and get him. You told him? Yes... it's obvious. He didn't notice. I'm going after him. No, I'm not. Let him come when he likes. I'll wait here. "Is this your missal?" I have a wife, of course. I see you, you are here. You're Thérèse. See? I remember. But that isn't all... Where are my everyday clothes? He's not dead. I told them so. He's alive. He called to me. He can't get out. That's all. Antoine... You understand... It was about my father. He was about to tell me. Antoine! I have something to tell you! Antoine... Antoine. Mummy! Where's the dead man? At Carrup's. We couldn't hear him coughing any more. My wife went to see. That's how we knew. Antoine? Antoine? Thérèse wants to tell you... He's gone. He went back. - Back where? - Up there. He thinks he hears his father's voice under the rocks. My brother is under the rocks. His father is alive. You always said he was dead. He and Séraphin loved the same woman. When Antoine was born, his father didn't want him. And that made Séraphin unhappy. Later, he grew attached to Antoine, who reminded him of her. If Antoine doesn't return, my baby will be fatherless. I don't want that. Look, it's snowing! I know his father. I could have told him. Antoine went back. Show me the way. It's because of the rocks. Dzozet, I must go up there. What if more rocks come down, like Plan says? All right. I'll go alone. You know what those rocks up there are called? There! You can see the fault, eh? The Diablerets! The little devils! Spend a night in my hut, and you'll see and hear them! I've heard them, seen them! They're white! They walk! And they moan! Like the wind against a rock ridge! Go on up! They're waiting for you! For you all! Don't look back! Don't look back ever again! Antoine! We're no longer alone! Go, Thérèse. Go. Talk him into coming back. Tell him, "There'll be three of us. A baby is coming. He will need you. Don't be afraid!" Antoine! It's her and him. Antoine! It's a woman and a man. Antoine! Antoine! Come back! Antoine, come back! My little mother! Antoine, my child. Subtitles: Raggio Verde - Rome Translation: AJS Craker
