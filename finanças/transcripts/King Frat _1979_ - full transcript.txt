Got a new strategy this year. I'm not gonna bother getting them kicked off campus. I'm not gonna bother getting their charter revoked. I'm gonna straighten out the Pi Kaps personally. Just like I straightened out the state pen when I was warden there. But, sir, wasn't that prison burned down to the ground by inmates? [blows] Don't ever mention that. Don't ever mention that! When I take over... [chuckles] I'm gonna have everybody walking the line. Fraternities, faculty, everybody.

Let me tell you how Yellowstream get its name, Kevin. [tribal music playing] Many years ago, my people, the Kissawong, lived on this very land. Hunted the forests, fished in the streams. It was our land. Then the white man came and drove my people up the river into the rocky hills where not even a gopher could live. My ancestors didn't like that. My ancestors pissed in white man's water for 50 years. White man never knew. Fucking dummies! [chanting in native language] Beer, Chief. Beer? Oh. Okay, okay. Santa Claus is here.

Man, we can party all the way to St. Patrick's Day! [all exclaiming] Uh, there's an entrance fee, guys. How much? Shit, too much, 50 bucks. Anything is too much. Our treasury is already blown, you guys. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We got a cherry coming in here tomorrow night, a new pledge. Uh, Tommy... Tommy something or the other. I think his parents could be persuaded to sponsor us. [laughs] You guys are just... just too, too much. Do you think we got a chance at winning? Does GrossOut have an asshole? [farts] [laughing] That's how I spell "relief." ♪ [typewriter clacking] [church bell tolling] [organ music playing] [Dean Doyle] Members of Yellowstream community, this is indeed a sad day for us all. We've come together today to mourn the untimely passing of one of the most respected and revered members of our community. Our beloved president, Robert J. McGafferty It's heartwarming to see so many students and friends here today. The mark of a man is the love he leaves behind, and we are a college full of love for this fine administrator... [sobbing] ...educator, and public servant. [continues indistinctly] Hey, look, there's a vent we can use. He was the youngest president Yellowstream has ever had, and his term of office was unfortunately marred by a general relaxation of the discipline for which Yellowstream has been known. And not all of us agreed with Bob's handling of student affairs. Man, this is some dynamite shit! It's too bad we gotta waste it like this. Well, it might be a waste of good shit, but at least it's going to a better calling. [blowing] [Dean Doyle] He was always the first to admit that he may have been too easy on them. But all that's going to change. The board of directors is selecting a new president, who, hopefully, will correct the mistakes of the past. [crowd giggling] Who will move the school back where it belongs, where "discipline" is not a dirty word, and bizarre behavior can be dealt with severely. [muffled laughs] I'm sorry that strikes you as funny over here. He spent his entire life in academia. He's never had the opportunity to discover what people do when all restraints are lifted. Right here, right here on this campus, we have a fraternity. And I'm not mentioning any names. This fraternity feels as though they have the run of the entire school. [crowd laughing] Well, they're in for a big surprise! What the hell is so damn funny? [all laughing] I wasn't warden at state pen for nothing. I know how to deal with people. I won't make the same mistakes McGafferty made. He was weak. He thought you could make students listen to reason. You were a fool! [hysterical laughter] And see where it got you. Well, now it's my turn! You rat-fat-faced, mealy-mouthed weasel! I'll bury you myself! Those punk heads, they think that college is summer camp! You farty freak! You coddled and babied them. Are you listening to me? Listen! Good riddance! [yelling] You schmuck! Hell, yeah! This is the time, baby! [yelling indistinctly] I'll dig the hole myself! [laughter continues] ♪ Oh, yeah. So how do you like it? Neat, huh? This can't be it. Oh, God! Tommy dear, when Dad and I said you could pledge a fraternity, we had no idea you'd choose something like this. We thought perhaps you'd choose a nice house. A fraternity like Alpha Omega. No, Mom! Gee! [Chief] Yeah! -Whoo! -Oh, my God! [yelling in native language] [exclaiming] -Chief, Chief, Chief! -What was that? Ah! Missed him again. Ah! Mr. and Mrs. Mathews. Oh, how good of you to bring Tommy with you! [laughs] Oh, hi, I'm Kevin. Pi Kappa Delta's pledge master. Oh, and that over there, that was Chief Latrine. Hey, did you know that he's a true Kissawong Indian? No, listen, you don't have to worry about him. He's a little shell-shocked since the Korean War. You know, we can't take him to a Chinese restaurant. [laughs] He thinks he's back in Pork Chop Hill again. [laughs] Get it? Pork Chop... Forget it. Hey! Hey, hey, Tommy. How you doing? You're all ready for initiation day? Hey, GrossOut is still here. You remember the whole-- We'll just get Tommy settled. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No parents are allowed inside when we initiate a pledge. Oh, but there's no need to worry. Yellowstream has a fine ambulance service. [laughing] [whistle blowing] [door opens] [drum roll playing] Guys, meet the Mathews. Mathews, meet the guys. [creaking] [growling] [laughs] Uh, there is a one-time initiation fee, sir. Did Tommy explain that to you? What for? Oh, well, to assure that Tommy doesn't get initiated. What kind of a con game is this? Uh, George, I think the boy is serious and, um, sincere. How much? Oh... $500. Five hundred dollars? Ah, here's the official Pi Kap courtesy car. [Mrs. Mathews gasps] Hello, everybody. [laughs] And if you folks are ready, it will take you back to the station. Oh, you, sir, keep writing, please. Thank you. -Tommy, remember to brush your teeth every night. -Okay, Mom. -And no late school nights, you hear? -Okay. -And remember to change your underwear every day. -Oh, Mom! -Watch out, watch out. -Make a hole. Make a hole. Whoops. [GrossOut] Make another hole up there. Let me introduce you to Fred, our president. Do you know that he's been kicked out of some of the best schools in the country? [Fred] Come on, Tommy, I'll show you around. [laughing] Call once a week, son, and write when you can. Aw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's really nothing to worry about, sir. Really. We've never lost one of them yet, you know? Well, just watch yourself here, Mrs. Mathews. Watch your head. [laughs] Come on, we haven't lost one yet. There you go. So, uh, where do the other pledges sleep? There are no other pledges. You mean I'm the only one? Yeah, well, consider it an honor. Pi Kaps don't pledge just anyone, you know? -[burps] -Think of all the attention you'll have. Excuse me, I gotta make a fundraising call. Uh, yeah, operator? How much is that? Eighty-five cents. Just a minute. I'll deposit. Yes, you're quite welcome. Have a nice trip. Ta-ta! [urinating] -Hi. -Hey! Gumbroski is the name, and drinking is my game. This here is Griselda. Say hi, Griselda. [Griselda] I love you. [GrossOut laughs] -Hello, Dad. Fred. -[speaking indistinctly] Fred. Fred, your son. You know what I like best about her? She don't tell, she don't swell, she is grateful as hell, she's disease-free, and best of all, she don't talk back. [Griselda] I love to please you. [GrossOut laughs] The point is, I'm really getting myself together, getting my, as they say around here, my shit together. You wanna have a go at her? Go ahead, you don't gotta worry about me being jealous. [Griselda] I love it. I love it. Make sure you give her a good scrubbing -when you're done with her, though. -Me? Yeah, you. Go ahead. Go right down the hall. They're... Griselda, right? Yeah. That's her name, Griselda. [Griselda] I love you. [burps] ♪ [laughing] [toilet flushing] [Kevin] Hey, hey. Listen to this.

"During electro surgery inside the colon, flammable intestinal gases have occasionally led to explosions, sometimes with fatal consequences." [all laughing] Are you ready? I'm ready. [farts] [exhales] How's that, guys, huh? Oh, shit, GrossOut. I've heard little kids do better than that. Yeah, if that's the best you can do, maybe we'd better forget the entrance fee, huh? Well, come on, guys. How about give me half a chance? This is a big opportunity for me. You never know. I might be able to make my living at it. [Fred] Well, then, you're gonna have to get with it. Now you drink this. [bubbling] Oh, God! What's in it, Chief? It-- Ugh. Smells like it got turds in it. What is it exactly, Chief? Hairy buffalo punch. Hairy buffalo, huh? Two sips, and you'll be getting to smell like one. Now drink it. Oh, no way! That stuff really work, Chief? Do white man shit on toilet? Down the hooch, GrossOut. Ugh! Man, you can die from that shit. Well, we got a hearse we could bury you in. [laughs] Okay, Jock. I'm sincerely sorry for what I'm gonna have to do now, GrossOut. No, no! Okay, Chief, pour it down.

Quiet dinner at the Pi Kap house? You're sick. [laughs] Oh, we'll go out. Sort of a celebration. What's the occasion?

What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing here? [Boyd] It's been two days, gentlemen. The police, Doyle, no one's turned up a clue. Our sacred Dionysus is out there somewhere, defiled, alone. He must be returned. I say it's time we take matters into our own hands. How do we do that, Boyd? Well, we know there's stuff going on in the house, and anyone capable of walking out of here with a hot comb is capable of walking out with Dionysus. We're dealing with an inside job. One of us? No, not a brother, a mother. Pi Kaps have a man planted right here. I'm sure of it. Who? [Boyd] Splash. Somebody called? Splash, my friend, could I have a word with you? Yes, boss. Maybe you can help me. You remember that statue we used to have here, the one that disappeared? Yes, boss. Well, if we could get it back, it might be worth something for you. Well, I think I might be able to locate it for you. That's what I thought. Grab him. Splash, you really fucked up. In ancient Greece, when a messenger was given something important, they often tattooed it to his scalp and let the hair grow back out. We have a message for that sick fraternity you belong to. Only our message isn't so secret. Here it is. Look, the suckers were over in, Doyle's got us set up. Now sooner or later, he'll be back with the storm troopers and bust our collective asses. I got yours, Chief. One pepperoni and peanut butter. [sighs] Jesus. All you guys think about is eating. We're in a serious situation here! Well, a man can't fart or belch without eating. Is it too late to take one more order? Splash! Oh, man! Who did this, Splash? Those asshole Alphas. Goddamn it! That's it, man. They pushed us too damn far. Anybody that can't take a harmless joke now and then has gotta pay for it. Aw, shit. Let's get him to the couch. Put this in. Why'd they do it, Splash? That statue. If we were smart, we'd take that stone faggot back to those turds and forget this whole damn thing. Alphas! Well, so much for that argument. [spits and burps] Alphas! You in there? You little legend of horseshits! Show your faces, you... chicken-shit faggots! Yeah, you! You take yourselves so goddamn serious. Don't you know that all this is shit? That you're a bunch of shits?

I got a present for you. [glass breaking] You want the rest of your precious statue back, you know where to find it. It's Pi Kappa house. It's King-fucking-Frat on this campus.
