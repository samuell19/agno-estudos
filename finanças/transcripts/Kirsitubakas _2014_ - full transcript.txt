CHERRY TOBACCO The dog peed on the rug again. He has to be taken out on time. I just got back from my shift. I'm turning in. I'm so beat. Yes. What's taking so long? Don't waste water! I just don't know... The water bill grows. How can you be so dirty that you have to bathe every day? Yes. Otherwise there's no point. Yes. And the pelvic muscles too, you should keep them tight. And when you bend down, your whole body should feel it. So you... wait a second. Are we going somewhere? - Mhm. And where are we going? Somewhere. And what are we doing there? Something. Laura's going somewhere to do something. Yes. Well, no one tells me anything around here. Of course she wears it. Hold on. Where's the hat Daisy made? Do you still wear it? Wait a sec. I just don't know. She talks back to me. When did your Alvar turn normal? Yeah, okay. Wait a second. Please don't make me wear it! Why do you always fight me on everything? Fine! See you. Hello! - Hey! Come in. Hello. - Hello. Egert, help the young lady's sweater off. - Yes, of course. Leave your shoes on. Okay. The flowers, the flowers. Oh, thanks! - For you! Egert, who gives roses with thorns on them? Look, this is what you do. Oh my! And here's our nice, little chicken. Everyone can have whatever piece they like. Egert, ask Laura what she wants. Which piece would you like? I don't care. Take the drumstick. That's what the chicken walks on. Here. Thanks. I'll go get myself a plate. There. Excuse me, I'm going to sit here because I have brand new dentures and I'd be so embarrassed if they fell on the plate! Let's eat then. Laura, there's salad and juice. Oh, no thanks. - Suit yourself. Egert, start a conversation. Ask the young lady something. How are you? - Good. Ask what she does. - What do you do in your free time? I dance and... - You dance? The ballet? No. - Hmm. What do you do? I make t-shirts and build sound systems. Egert is musical. He could even study recording. He'll do well. Okay, I'll leave you two alone... You want some? Laura, don't worry about me. I just came for some chicken. For work. We all eat from boxes nowadays. Just this piece. Let's do something cooler. Watch this. Well? I can't sell these anyway. You can have them. They're top quality. I'll put them in a bag and you can have them both. Hey, dad. What's up? Good. Me? Same as always... Summer... is so pointless. Summer, winter, who cares. Glad to hear it. Laura! -Hey. - Laura, hi, my God! Look, Rando! Hi! I didn't think you'd come. Joke! - What a fuckin' idiot. Come on. Hey! Hey. I have an idea. What? Let's go for a hike together. What do you mean by hike? My father's friend organizes hikes to the forest or swamp. He goes talking to wolves there. Alright... We should go. For a couple of days. Go talk to wolves? Well... My name is Joosep Tammiksaar. I'll take you to the bog. If you're lucky, I'll bring you back too. Something different, right? Meet the Bear. He's a real beast. Unfortunately only in his dreams. So you can pet him. All aboard! You just know that guy has a homemade knife for whittling. Keep the windows open. Natural ventilation. I hope you all have rubber boots... ...long johns and several pairs of socks. I don't have rubber boots. - I told you we're going to the bog! Here's the good part. Merit. - Yeah? Come here, please. Put this on. How does it work? Well?... Haha... Schschc... what language is this? Polish. Ewa Demarczyk, my favorite! Nice. What's she singing about? How should I know. It's in Polish. Eww! The old guy's in heat. He's still warm. Wild animals will find him and have a good meal. What! We can't leave him like this! We don't have time for a deer funeral. And it's all part of the natural cycle of life, so... Let's go. Laura! Yep. Here again. Come on. Well, hi again. - Hello. We're back. How's it going? Erase it! - No! You have weird pictures of me too. ...come on, we talked about this... The boys went through the closets and thought they'd try something new... That's sick! -Yeah, totally gross! And they found stuff and made dinner. It looks gross but it was really good. End of the line. We go on foot from here. Girls, you chop the onions. What do we do with the onion peels? Be careful with this. Anything more to say? This mush is no good... There. Now this is real camping food. Pure energy. Thanks... I drink a cup of grease on winter hikes. Ewww! - Mmm! Go on... No need to watch your weight, huh? The bog isn't low and wet like a marsh. It's like a big bubble held by thousands of years of moss growth. To really understand the bog, let's stick our fingers in the peat moss. Now pull a tuft out. Look. Peat moss has a tip, but not a defined lower part. And here you see the peat moss slowly turning into russet peat. Well, Tiit? Remember this? Let's go then. Hold this. You got it? Maybe Tiit can help. I told her I want to study dance abroad... ...and she said she knows what young girls really do over there. Yes, dad, I have to be patient, but... you weren't. What did you say? Merit and Laura. You can pitch your tent here. Get rid of your cigarette. - Why can't I be myself? We're on vacation! Throw it away. And help me with the tent. Stop nagging me all the time. - I don't do it all the time. Stop nagging me! Where'd you get these? - Spoils of war. Try them on. Well? Take it off. Ah, wait a sec. Can you get this off? - There has to be a way... Karmen, listen... You don't have to... What...? Have you told something to the boys? And I'm keeping this circus going Filling out the books under the stage I can make the lion into a lamb or take care of the three bears I can make the lion walk the line... How was that?-Very good! Let's move on. Truth or dare? Truth. What should I ask? - I don't know. You think of something. I can't. Well, I'll ask then. So... No, let Tiit ask. Who was your first love? Ask something normal. That's a totally normal question. I don't know, I have nothing to say. Liar! Yes she does. Last year, she joined the dance team... - Merit! Why do you have to bring this up now? You picked truth. I'm telling the truth. So Laura joined the dance team. There was a coach named Toomas. Charming, but a real loser, you know. Our Laura's a real loser magnet. Jesus, Merit! Sorry! I don't know, maybe just tell us what kind of boys you like. I like men who... know how to use their body. Truth or dare? Dare. Dance for me. What? Here? Now? - Yep. I can't do it like this. And there's no music. Imagine it. Well? Okay. Do you know what this is? No. It's a ritual Eskimo dance. It brings luck for the hunt. It's a one-dimensional dance. But African dances are three-dimensional. You never know where danger lurks. Behind one bush, another, or a third. But at the fourth bush... you attack! Don't pee yourself! Seriously, man, put it back. Idiot! You got anything better? Put it back in your pants! Who pees that long? Hurry up! I want to have some fun... How long was that? Did you use a bottle? Hey there, boys. - Hello. Didn't you see the sign? - Where? No. You can't drive here. It's a nature preserve. You're playing loud music and throwing bottles everywhere... Hey, old man, chill out. Look, boys, get this car out of here. We came here to enjoy nature. Don't push me. - I didn't. Stop pushing me.-I'm not. I just want you guys to leave. - We will. So get in your cars and... What the... What the hell? - Don't hit the chick. He comes to talk and you just punch him like that? But he shouldn't have... - You don't punch someone like that! Sorry. That's right! Run away! You baby! Get in your pussymobile and go rave somewhere else! Let's get out of here! And buy some brains on the way! You don't want to come?... Nothing personal. Let me try. Is it bad? Uh, yeah. It is. What do you mean? Well... That bad? Does it hurt? I was right not to punch back, right? Yeah, yeah. Of course. I don't fight children in principle. Right. Morning! - Good morning. Come on, let's go for an energizing morning swim! No, thanks. What do you consider normal? Right now I'm on this hike. Yeah, Merit invited me. But it's like a freak parade here... I think these were already digested by a raccoon. What?! Look, the berries aren't on the twig and this looks like raccoon droppings. It still tastes good... Pure nature! My hands are frozen. Yeah, mine too. Who would've thought you'd need gloves in August? Listen. I've learned one thing in life: you can't buy silence. You have to find it. It's like a church here. The cathedral of silence. But this isn't just silence. It's the sum of sounds. You have to learn to listen. Not hear, but listen. Like birds. One starts, another picks it up... Then a third... But people don't listen, they chatter and create noise. A friend of mine says that birds only sing to cool down their genitals. Laura! Hey! About another kilometer and that's the end of our hike. I hope you had a break from civilization. Of course you're always welcome. This was mere foreplay for a real marathon. Laura, come here. I want to talk to you. Yeah? Look, no one's waiting for me back home. Can we stay and hitchhike back? Stay here? Longer? - Yeah, what do you think? I don't know, I think I want to go home. Home? Who's waiting for you? Well... - Well? I invited you so we could do something together. You said summer's over and it was no fun. Maybe you can stay too? Merit wants to stay so... No, no, I have to take them back. But you can come back. No can do. - Okay, we get it. That's cool. Alright, then, let's go. Who's coming with me, who... Laura, are you staying? I don't know. It's up to you guys. I always recommend spending time in the fresh air. Sure, let's stay. It will be fun. Okay! I'll show you where you can stay by the lake. Where there isn't a soul in sight. We're here, okay? - Mhm. ...I'll fix it... Okay then. Thanks. Bye-bye! - See ya! What do you think of him? I guess he's kind of weird. Weird? You two spent a lot of time together. What are you saying? You know! Merit! Laura. I'll never settle down with some moss beard dude! I just want you to be careful. I don't need to be careful. You do a little. He's like a fisherman. Throws his line and pulls the fish out. Yeah, but I'm not a fish. Fish or not, that's his oldest trick. He gets all cozy with his pipe and nuts and then lies down and... Merit! - Laura. What are you talking about? He's an old friend of my dad's. I've heard stories. What stories? Never mind. You brought it up, so tell me. You don't want to hear them. You started, so go on... Hey! - Oh my God, Joosep! I couldn't leave you two alone. It was a bad idea to leave you two here. I went to the city. But realized it's much better in the forest. Mhm. Everything is cleaner. More clear. Is everything okay? I'd rather be alone right now. - Yeah? Why? I know you like young girls but I'm not your type. What do you mean, my type? I'm not going to swoon while you voodoo me with your wisdom. Laura, what are you talking about? You're like a stupid traveling ladies' man. A what? How would you like it, if your wife said, I'm gonna travel for a year but you stay, watch the kids and keep the bed warm... Look, Laura... You look! It's not that simple. Of course not! The other way around is much better. Sometimes you don't understand... You don't know what you want... Then... You need time to... Others can't... What am I talking about! So how did you like the hike? I don't know, kind of boring. But don't worry. At my age, I'm always bored. Nothing you can do about it. Mh! Dammit! Karmen, why don't you get it? We went over this. Please, listen! Don't you... Dammit! Laura, now what are you doing? Where's Joosep? Somewhere I guess. Let's go back to sleep. Laura! What are you doing here? - Are you nuts or something? Get out of there! No. Laura, he's a mess. Stop it. Get out please. A melodramatic man. How unsexy! Laura, please, let's go back to sleep. Screw you both, seriously! Wait! Wait! Please don't fall any more. Sorry. Take that wet shirt off. Turn around. You can turn back now. Put this on. Well? Good night. Good night. You want some? What is it? A surrealist's breakfast. - Ah. I found it! Put your hand out. Am I interrupting? Girls! Get in! The water feels great today. Come on! I think I'm gonna try it. You coming? Well? What happened yesterday? Nothing. But Joosep was weird. What's up with him? I guess he just needed to talk. With you? Well, yeah. Who's there? - Hi there, Jan. Hiking again? - Yeah, of course. I'm going to bed. But it was fun. - All right. Hey, I'm going to bed. - Already? Yeah, I'm tired. - But... It's a little colder here.-Yeah. There's more moisture in the air. Now it's warm again. - Yeah. It smells good here. I still have that bog smell in my nose. Hair picks up smells. Can I? What? Smell. - Oh, yeah. Of course. What do we have here? A smoke sauna. A hint of egg. And the nuance of river water. In other words, a very personal bouquet. I remember things by smell. I remember the smell of my first teddy bear. It was some nasty rubber, but I liked it. And my dad's old pack of cards. I stole one so I could smell it. How will you remember me? You know. No, I don't. Would you light a pipe, sir? My thoughts exactly. That's the smell. I guess I'm just a stinker. No. A man has to smell like sweat and tobacco. A man has to smell like a man. I know you can't make any promises. But I just want moments to remember. Can you give me these? I think I have to get this. Yes. We're here at Jan's. Having a sauna, you know. Well, did you think it over? What? Seriously? Well, that's great! Yeah! I'm very happy! Okay, put him on... What's up, little man? Why aren't you asleep? Were you playing? Who won? Okay. We'll play tomorrow. Yes, daddy will be there... Listen to mommy and go to sleep. Nighty-night, okay? Yeah, I love you too. Yes... Go to sleep now, Laura. Good night. It ran... into the forest, right... And... it smacked into a tree, right? And it fell and... And it... and it got stuck... The charts... look. You don't care. Look, Bear. Let's add you. Smile! Very good! Well, how was the hike? Okay. What's this? - I cleaned. Daisy's hat? You're not watching your weight any more? Stop touching me! - I wanted to... -Get out! Laura, dear, you want something to eat? I'll heat up the sauce for you. So you're not going to talk to me at all, then? Why don't you knock? - Why can't you clean up in here? I will! What is it? Are you in love or something? No! You are! I don't know... The first time feels... real, you know? Like, for real? - Yeah, for real, like... I don't want to get my hopes up. Knowing me, it'll end... I don't know... But right now it's so good I feel sick. How are you? - Mh? Have you seen your moss beard? Well? Have you? - Yeah, our plans are made. We'll buy a hut in the forest, get goats and chickens... I promised him three kids. What? Shut up! Chickens?! Hi. Hi. I got you a gift. It has that song we listened to on the bus. Cool... thanks. I had the words translated. Ah, this is Laura. A nature lover. She was on the hike. Hello. - Hello. Karmen. Come on in then. Joosep will get you some coffee and... Ah, no, I can't today... - Nonsense, of course you can. Come on! Here you go. Thanks. Offer her some coffee. Milk? Yes. Joosep don't drink from the carton. - I'm checking if it's good. Ewa Demarczyk! Joosep and I love her! Well then... My longing eyes still sing for you... You are a piece of art and my heart is breaking. I have to go. You say farewell, but your hand is not trembling in mine I left. Our conversation unfinished like a lovely dream. I yelled and cursed, You lovely piece of art. A really nice gift. Beautiful words. I'm glad your clients like beautiful things. So how was the hike? Great. What was great about it? I mean, if you go to the bog, you should do it with this guy. Joosep knows all the species and the secret spots. And wherever he is, he always knows how to make it back home. Damn it, dad! Where are you when I need you? I adore the smell of roses. Come in! My daughter will be right back. Where can she be! And with guests invited... No I just stopped by... - Oh! Thank you! Come in! These Polish faucets. If you screw it too tight, it breaks the seal. Hey. Hi! Where were you? Your guest's been waiting. Hey! - Hi. Happy birthday. - Thanks. 18 roses! And I took the thorns off. That's sweet. Egert really is very helpful. A true suitor! Well, have fun. What am I going to do with you? Cheers! Wait. How are you? Good. This is Joosep. Hello. - Hello. Olaf. Sass. And this is Egert. My good friend. You are wearing the T-shirt I made. Oh, really? It's a good shirt. Very durable. I wear it everywhere, the forest, garage, at home... I'll even wear it to the President's ball! Someone has to wash it from time to time also. Yeah. Just a sec. It was good to see you Laura. You too. Good to see you. Let's go. You know that guy? - Hm? Do you know that guy? Ah, yeah. A little. We went on a hike together once.
