[Lionsgate music] [Saban Films music] [suspenseful music] [car engine humming] [car door slamming] [pawnbroker] Hey. Hi. What do you got? Um... two things. This... this one was my father's. He, he left it for me before he passed away. Um, he lived a good long life and... he died peacefully. This one, uh... this one was my mom's, and she left it for me very recently. She just passed away. Yeah. Thank you. She was... she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It was incredibly painful for her, you know, and for me, because... I mean, we are so close. It's so crazy to have to be doing this, but you know, times have been just so hard on my, on my wallet, and if I'm shooting you straight, the truth is I'm, I'm hard up, and I'm a bit desperate. I'll do a grand for the pair. Ooh. Uh... Whoa, took me by surprise there, um... A grand. No offense, but I think I could get at least three if I try my luck somewhere else, so. Fifteen hundred. A piece? For both. All right, 18, but I'm not going any higher. Flatten it a two, you got yourself a deal. Come on, you crafty son of a bitch. You know you're gonna make a fortune on these things. Yes, you are. Two for two, two for fucking two. Nod that head. All right, two. Yes. [Pawnbroker] You're lucky I'm in a giving mood. Yes, I'm a lucky boy. I trust you as an honest man. Do you have a back door here? Right. Yeah, this way. [suspenseful music] [engine revving] [tires screeching] Fucking idiot! Whoo, fucking idiot! ♪ Drop when I say drop ♪ ♪ One shot, one shot ♪ ♪ Going in forward ♪ ♪ One shot, one shot ♪ ♪ That's the price You spend for it ♪ ♪ Drop when I say drop ♪ ♪ Drop when I say drop ♪ [gun cocks] -[indistinct radio chatter] -[suspenseful music] [keyboard clacks] There's our guy. [traffic whirring] [motor humming] A match came through on the partial print. This is our prime suspect. Jason Derek Brown. It's kind of tough to say where he might be headed at this point. He's had over a dozen addresses across the American Southwest, and he never seems to stay in one place for too long. All right, Wallace, Young. I want you two working on credit cards. Got it. Jackson, cell phones, local surveillance. Ballard, bank accounts. And with that, we should see what kind of trail this guy leaves us pretty soon. [car door slamming] [trunk slamming] [knocking on door] Hi. Is there something I can help you with? Lance Leising, FBI. Did you know the man who lived across the street? Yeah, I leased him that house over there. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions? Won't take long. Sure. Now, how well would you say you got to know your tenant during the time that he lived there? I'd say I got to know him pretty well. When he first arrived here, it was pretty hard not to notice him. [faint radio music] Morning. Do you remember what Jason told you that he did for a living? Hm-mm. I remember him saying something like... My brother and I import and export golf equipment from Asia. We're, we're huge in China and Japan. My bro operates outta Cali. He handles the day to day and me, I am expanding our, our clientèle right here. And you believed that? I did. He seemed pretty well off. I have an idea. What if I bought you a drink right after I signed right here on this dotted line? Um... I would love to, but my son gets back from school any second. Really? You have a son? Yeah. How old is he? What's his name? Okay. His name is Zachary. That's him in his baseball uniform. Wow. He's a handsome kid. He's a handsome kid. He looks kinda like a young Ashton Kutcher. [chuckling] Okay, I should get going, let you get settled in. If you need anything, I'm literally across the street, so. Hey, do you think you, you'd take a rain check on that drink? Maybe. Look, maybe he was a little ostentatious, and I'm sure there were some people he rubbed the wrong way, but when I needed Jason's help, he really was there for me. -[pop music playing] -Jason, Jason. Jason. Jason, I'm so sorry to bother you. What's up, Melanie? Everything all right? Yeah, no, everything's fine. [chuckling] I need a favor. [Jason clicks tongue] Do you like video games? Yes! I like them too. That's why I own so many. Have you played this one yet? Nah, my mom won't let me. She says it's too violent. What? Too violent, dude. I love your mom, but fuck that. We're playing. Yeah. Fuck that. Now you can't just be a little pussy and go and tell your mom, "Mom, um Jason let me play Kick Punch Crunch." [chuckling] Yeah, I mean no. I'm not a pussy. I won't tell her. [chuckles] Good man. [characters grunting] [laughing] You know, Jason was really great with kids. Right. I don't know. Maybe it's just because deep down he's like a big kid himself, really. You know, with all the toys he had and the money he threw around. He actually endeared himself to the neighborhood pretty quickly. Oh, come on, I thought you guys said you were fast! [cheering] Zachary! Melanie, I apologize if my next question makes you uncomfortable. But I spoke with a few of your neighbors, and some of them seemed to be under the impression that you and Jason... [Melanie] What? Might have had an intimate relationship. That's completely ridiculous. So there's no truth to it? No, Jason and me, no! We couldn't be more mismatched. I'm a quiet woman from the suburbs and he's him. [Melanie giggling] So no, we didn't have an intimate relationship. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. [both moaning] [chuckling] All right. I can't believe we just did this. -Really? -[coughing] -Ooh... -[laughing] Because one minute, I'm leasing you a house, and an next minute, I'm fucking you in my bedroom. Yeah. [laughing] Stop laughing. Stop! What am I gonna say to Zach? Yeah, you need to relax. Zach is a great kid, and you're a great mother and you worry way too much. Do you think I'm a great mom? I do. I do think so. [phone buzzing] Whoa. What? I'm so sorry. I gotta take this. It's a nightmare client. Won't leave me alone. [female automated voice] Please hold for your quick and easy loan from Quick Cash. [debt collector] Well, it's nice to finally get the elusive, Mr. Jason Derek Brown on the phone. Sorry, he's not here. [Debt Collector] Really? Then who am I speaking to? His brother. What's this all about? [Debt Collector] I need to speak with Jason immediately. Why? [Debt Collector] Because he owes us a lot of money. You hear me? So you tell your brother to get on the phone or we're gonna track him down and get our money back. And if we don't hear from him, then we'll get the police involved and throw him in jail. How do you think he'll like that? I'm afraid you're not gonna be able to do that. [Debt Collector] How do you figure that? My brother is dead. [Debt Collector] Bullshit. 9/11. He was on flight 175 from Boston. Do you know how common the name Jason Derek Brown is? I get so many phone calls from people like you, and I'm so sick and tired of having to explain myself over and over again. My brother is dead, and nothing is gonna bring him back. I'm trying to move on with my life and you people are sick. You should be fucking ashamed of yourselves. [sobbing] [Debt Collector] I, I sincerely apologize. I must have had the-- Fucking moron! [laughing] Whoo! Bitch, bitch! Boom! So Jason vacates your property here on Nighthawk Way with six months left on his lease? He must have given you a good reason for that. Yeah, he said his brother's wife was sick with breast cancer. And he wanted to go spend time with his family. It seemed like a good enough reason for me. It would be, if it were true. But I know Jason's brother and his wife, Amy, who is perfectly healthy. Really? I have a tough time believing that. He's a con man, Melanie, plain and simple. This is what he does. All those toys he had, the Cadillac, the BMW, the boat he took you on. He got them all through scams, bank fraud. None of it was his, not a single thing was paid for. You seem like a very kind woman. And I'm sorry if all this news about Jason is tough for you to take. You definitely deserve better. My son is going to be home any second. Zachary, right. Do call me if you remember anything else. [upbeat pop music] Hey, hey, hey, can I have a shot? And I'll start a tab. Vodka. -Cheers! -Cheers. Hey! Oh my goodness, are you enjoying your stay with us here this evening? You both look like somebody that I would like to meet. I'm Jason, what's yours? -Michelle. -Stacy. Michelle and Stacy. Listen, Michelle, I feel like you don't fully like me yet, but we're gonna get there. We're gonna get there. And if you don't mind, Stacy, how about I order us all around the drinks. We sit down and talk about this. [laughs] You know? Hey, I know you. I fucking know you! I played behind you last week, 2:30 tee time. Right, I saw your Bentley out in the, out in the old parking lot. Very nice! Now, listen, I've gone ahead and I've taken the pleasure of ordering you and your beautiful friends here a round the drinks. Thanks, but we have drinks on the way. Thanks, but we have drinks on the way, he says like goddamn John Wayne. [laughing] This son of a bitch. The last time you turned down a shot, the Bills were in the Super Bowl. Hey, we got a thirsty mother fucker over here. Can we get some shots? [Bartender] Coming up. -[chuckling] -Yeah, I know you. [upbeat pop music] Let's go down one more time. All right. I will see you downstairs. Yeah? Oh my God! Thanks, daddy. [upbeat rap music] [grunting] [girls cheering] [cheering] Yo, yo, yo, what's up? Yo, check out my boat! -And my bitches! -[girls cheering] Yeah, we're here chilling 'cause it's my birthday! -[Jason howling] -[girls cheering] I've got about five pounds of Columbian rocket fuel in my pocket. Anybody wanna come sit on the captain's lap? [cheering] [Jamie] Jason was the sweetest when we were growing up. He was sensitive. Maybe even touchy. He would always cry whenever he got his feelings hurt, which was like all the time. He was my best friend. So he's in ninth grade here? Yeah, yeah. He, he always looked so young for his age. Jamie, I know this has been difficult for you, but what I'm trying to understand is what went wrong? How did your brother go from this sweet, sensitive kid like you're telling me, to this? My dad. [whimsical TV music] Are you kids having fun? You like this hotel room? It's better than the rooms we had in Vegas. Right? Jason, pour me a tall one. Good man. Have a sip. Ugh! [chuckling] It's all right, you'll get used to it. I wanna see mom. Oh, I'm sorry, am I not enough for you? I just miss her. I know. I know you do, sweetheart. I know you do. Ah, shh, Jamie, don't cry. It's not your fault. Your mother's just a cold, weak person. She's a loser. That's not true. You won't let us see her. If it's not true, then how come she didn't fight harder for full custody? She asked me for a divorce, and then she gives up on you three. She didn't give up. You lied. I would never give up on you guys the way she did. I'm always gonna take care of you three. No matter what, I'm always gonna do what's best for this family. Jamie sweet, sweet, Jamie. You can cry if you want. It'll ruin our fun, like she would, if you want. -I hate you! -Oh, love bug. That's gonna change eventually, all right? But as long as you hate me, no allowance. Boys. Go down to the arcade. Have some fun, have a good time, all right? [upbeat rap music] Yeah. Be 120, honey. You see that hand? You know what that means? Oh, shit. I actually don't have any cash on me. That's not a problem. Oh. Here we go. [beeps] Sorry, declined. That must be the bank's fault. That's okay, 'cause I got another one. This is the one that will work. [beeps] Oh. -Come on, let's go. -Oh. -[Bouncer] You can't hear? -Whoa, bro, easy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. -Hello. -[Bouncer] Mother fucker. -Fucking deadbeat! -Fuck you, bro. [tires screeching] Fuck! [grunts] -[Man] Come on. -Get off of me! I'll get your money! [Jason grunting] [gun clicking] Three days, 80 grand. You fucking understand? You fucking understand? -Yes. -[Man] Do you? Yes! Yes, yeah, yeah. [moaning] Oh fuck. Ow, fuck. [groaning] [tires screeching] Fuck. I'm sorry, Mr. Harline. But you're maxed out. I just want some help on my mortgage. Looks like you need help with more than your mortgage. I'm sure you'll figure something out. [low grunts] You want some advice, kid? Get out of town. [knocking on door] Hey, ma! Jason, you should have called. So good to see you. Hey. [moans] All right. Let me take a look around. I love what you've done in the bedrooms. Place looks great. Nice job. Thanks. David took good care of you. What happened to your face? Bar fight. Brilliant. So mom, I'm not gonna lie to you. There's a reason I came here. There doesn't have to be a reason. Yeah, well I was hoping that we could rewrite the narrative of our relationship, and I think I have exactly what we both need. [mother] Jason, what is this? This is my new business, and we are huge in local markets right now because I have billboards up and down the coast. -Billboards? -Yeah, you would not believe how much money these things make me. 2003, I had my biggest fiscal year to date. If you look out that window, you see that Cadillac. I own that now, mom. That's how much I'm crushing it. And I'm not the only one profiting. All of my investors are making money, hand over fist. We're talking 200 percent return on investments. So I started thinking, you know like, why can't I do this for the people that I love? I started thinking, why can't I do this for you, and mom, I know that I have not been the best son. Right, and I messed some things up, but I do believe that this can change that. And I do know for a fact that if you invested $20,000... Yeah, $20,000. I could quadruple your money. So this time next year, you and I, we're vacationing in Cabo. Five star resort. Margaritas on the beach all day. What do you say? I was wondering how long it had been since I'd last seen you. But then I realized this is your first time seeing this house. You know how long ago it was that David got it for me? Well, we're gonna get you a better one after I'm done. Three years. That's how long it's been since you visited me. I know, and truly, I'm sorry. And then you have the audacity to walk in here and ask me for $20,000? Twenty thousand dollars of my money? This is a huge opportunity, huge. For whom exactly, tell me. For both of us. Cut the shit, Jason, please. How stupid do you think I am? I know you borrowed money from David, from Jamie. It's not true. They invested. And then you come here prancing around in a fucking Cadillac. I had a good year, mom. Son! I know that car isn't yours. I know there's no business, no opportunity. So no, I won't be investing. Yep, well, mom, I think you really might want to... rethink that one because I mean the profits we made this year alone, do you understand how much money that you could make? Enough! Jesus Christ! Who do you think you're fooling with all that CEO talk bullshit? I'm your mother! Is there any part of that brain of yours that could just tell you to stop? I'm sorry, Jason. I can't lend you any more money. I know that's why you drop by, 'cause of course that's the only reason you ever do come by, but I just can't do it this time. I'm in trouble, mom, I'm in big trouble. I need your help, please. You're some actor, you know that. I'm not acting. I'm not acting. These guys, if I don't pay them money, they're gonna kill me. Oh, God, you really are your father's son. Sometimes I think the only difference between you two is that you are just delusional enough to buy your own bullshit! I'm sorry, Jason. I shouldn't have said that. No, no, no. It's... it's all right. I should go. I should go. Do you know what gives me great comfort? Is that a year from now I'm gonna be sunbathing on a yacht. Sailing the Pacific with seven Victoria's Secret supermodels. Roaming the globe and living it up. And do you know where you're gonna be, mom? Right fucking here, all alone. A mean, old miserable bitch. Get out, now. Get outta my house. It was a nice visit. See you again in another four years. Goodbye, Jason. [somber music] [Jason] It's my dad's. No, my father's. This was my father's. He died peacefully. He died peacefully. He lived, he lived a good life. This, this one was my mom's. She left this for me. She left me this recently because she, um, she recently passed away. She recently passed away. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which was very painful for her. And it was very painful for me, too. You know, because we were so close. We were so close, me and that miserable fucking bitch, yeah. I am so fucking good, bro. Real fucking tears. She's my... she's my best friend. She was my best friend. It was a nice visit, yeah. Thanks, mom. Thanks, dad. Wherever the fuck you are. [car door slamming] Hi. Here you go, Leising. [Jamie] Ten years ago, my brother was a completely different person. He was married. He was a Mormon, straight edge. I mean he was a missionary in France. That, that was his whole life. Ten years ago, you said? Yeah. Isn't that right about the time that your father went missing? Jamie? Dad's probably on a beach somewhere drinking mai tais. Probably trying to fuck a nurse or something, you know. [David] Fuck a nurse? Yeah, dad loves nurses. Seriously, man. I remember he used to say nurses are the most sexual women. I don't remember him saying that. Does sound like some shit he would say. He's gonna have stories when he gets back. [David] J, I don't think he's coming back, man. Well, if that's happening then so is this. It's a little big for you, no? I get it fitted. You know, it's probably fake. Oh, you jealous bro, that you didn't grab it first? [David] I couldn't care less, man, let's go. [Jamie] Jason, David, what the hell is going on? -[Jason] Hey. -[David] Hi. Hi? What the fuck? Where is dad? Hello? What the hell are you guys packing? I mean, obviously you've been talking to him. Don't get involved, Jamie. Don't tell me to fuck off. Don't tell me to not get involved. All right, the cops called me. -Yeah? -[Jamie] Yeah. What did you tell them? I don't know, David. Nothing, 'cause I don't know anything. So can you just please tell me what the hell is going on? What did they tell you? I, I don't know. Oh, they found his car abandoned in Brownsville, Texas right by the Mexican border. So explain this to me. Don't get involved. -Let's go. -Seriously, David? Hey, hey, Jason. Can you please just tell me what the hell is going on? Yeah, hey, don't worry about it. We're just squaring some stuff away for him. Dad's coming back. I always tell you the truth. You know that, right? -[truck horn honking] -[David] Let's go! So annoying. Those pants look better on me. Stop. I'll let you borrow them. [Jason] There's that smile. Love you. Love you. [engine humming] [buttons beeping] Come on! [thuds] [engine humming] This is the Glock model 21. It's a 45 ACP. This is what your Secret Service uses. Military personnel. A lot of police officers choose that as a service weapon. [suspenseful music] How do I look? Deadly. Good answer. [camera clicking] You wanna shoot it? Fuck yeah. [gun firing] [officer] Kyle Wallace. -Open up. -[knocking on door] -Police. -[knocking on door] Kyle! [dramatic music] [yelps] Get the fuck off me, man! Get the fuck off. I didn't do nothing! Pieces of shit. I didn't fucking do nothing. This is bullshit. [Leising] All right, Kyle, let's go. Tell me how you know this guy. Who that, man? He put down the address of this apartment when he bought a Glock. Now I know you know Jason, and I know he's been here recently. So let's try this again. How do you know this guy? All right, I met Jason a while back. Come on. It's not like we close or anything. He's a fun dude to party with and shit. Anyway, he came through here completely out the blue. Word on the street, he had gambling debt to some coldblooded motherfuckers. [Jason] Yo, Kyle Wallace! Dude borrowed money from everyone. Okay. [Kyle] Jason? Oh, buddy. What are you doing here? Passing through, dog. Yo, come kick it with me for a bit. Man, I heard you were in some deep shit, like for real. Nah, nah, nah, nah. I took care of that. Money's in the account. It's all straight, I swear. Kick with me for a bit. I got something I wanna talk to you about. I got a little uh... A little opportunity I wanna run by you. [loud snorting] Oh fuck. That's good shit. -[Jason] Yeah. -It's Cali shit? [both groaning] So are you going to tell me about this opportunity? What's good? Yeah, bro. Check it out. I'm gonna rob an armored truck, and I want you to help me. Now look, I've done a bunch of research. Now check it out, check it out. A fucking box office from a theater on a big fucking weekend, like a weekend after fucking Thanksgiving can have up to $300,000 cash. On hand, right? -Right? -Right. -[Jason] Right? -Right. So now the fucking armored truck pulls up outside the theater on the Monday morning. That guard walks with one fucking bag full of all that cash, all that fucking cash. So on his walk from the fucking theater into the fucking truck, that motherfucker's completely fucking vulnerable. Kyle, it's like one man against a loaded gun. You know what I'm saying? It's practically risk free. All you gotta do... is pop him first. You know? You're fucking with me, right? No. Motherfucker, you ever popped a dude before? Have you? I haven't had to, but I've seen dudes get shot, and let me tell you something, bro. That shit's above your pay grade. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Is that a no, mommy? Is that a no, mommy? [chuckling] But I want to, mommy. [laughing] But I want to, mommy! You fucking with me. I've seen dudes get shot! I've been in the mud! [laughing] I've seen things! You know what I'm saying? Yo, yo, yo, answer me one fucking question right fucking now. [Kyle] What the fuck, bro? Is this shit still above my fucking pay grade? What the fuck? I'm not fucking kidding, dawg. Put the fucking shit down. Click, it's empty, bro. Fucking, what the fuck was that? -Ow! -Fucking crazy! Think that shit's funny? -I'll slap your shit! -I'm fucking with you. Get the fuck out of my house! -Yo, Kyle! -Get the fuck out of my house! When did you turn into such a whiny ass little bitch? -I'm joking. -I ain't no fucking bitch! Get the fuck out of my house! I'm sorry, all right? Dude, chill, I'm kidding. Dude, fucking chill, bitch. Get your panties out of a fucking bunch. -You're fucking out of it. -[Jason] Oh! Whatever path you're on, Jason... That's all you, bro. Fucking Kyle Wallace is a fucking pussy. [Kyle] Fuck off! Kyle Wallace is fucking pussy. [blabbering] And that's it. I ain't seen him again after that. He called me fucking 16 times the next day, but I didn't pick up. I just avoided him. Hmm. All right, Kyle. Book him. What the fuck, man? I didn't do shit! This is bullshit! Fucking, fuck you guys! Fucking pigs. Goddamn it. [man] Three days. You fucking understand? [Debt Collector] I need to speak to Jason immediately, 'cause he owes us a lot of money. You hear me? [Jeanne] How stupid do you think I am? I know you borrowed money from David, from Jamie. [loan officer] I'm sorry, Mr. Harline, but you're maxed out. [Jeanne] And then you come here. Prancing around in a fucking Cadillac. [loan officer] You want some advice, kid? Go to the arcade. Have a good time, for God's sake. [Debt Collector] So you tell your brother, get on the phone or we're gonna get the police involved and throw him in jail. [Jeanne] Is there any part of that brain of yours that could just tell you to stop! [slow suspenseful music] [door rattling] [engine humming] Hey, Mel. Yeah, guess who? -Hi. -Hi. I was pretty surprised when he called. I hadn't heard from him in over a year, I think. [Zachary] Jason! Ah-ha! [Melanie] And he said he was just passing through town, and he needed a place to stay for a few nights. So what did you say? I said of course. Truth be told, he was a pretty great house guest. He'd usually go out in the mornings, and then stay gone most of the day. [Jason laughing] The ball is high, the ball is deep! It's gone! Yes! So he stayed with you for 10 days? I guess. Didn't really feel like that long. [soft moaning] But he didn't spend Thanksgiving with you, right? Yeah. He left the morning of. He said he had to spend it with his family. I really think you should spend Thanksgiving with us. Yeah, baby, you know I want to, but I gotta spend it with Jamie this year. Otherwise she'll kill me. Come on, you really shouldn't be mad. I'm not. Hey, hey. You shouldn't be sad either. You wanna know why? Why, why? Because I'm moving back here in January. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I'm coming back here in January. So can the two of you wait a couple months for me? 'Cause if I come back here, if I roll up back here and there's another dude living in the street, you know, across the street, and he come in here and swept you off your feet, I swear to God, I'm going to throw you off the roof. -Really? -Yeah, hey. I love you. Hey, buddy. I gotta hit the road. But before I do, I wanted to give you this, like an early Christmas present. No way! This is amazing. Thank you. You're welcome. Melanie, I hate having to tell you this, but he lied to you again. Jason didn't spend Thanksgiving with Jamie or anyone from his family. Instead, he spent it alone at a motel, just five miles from your house. No, that... that can't be true. I'm sorry. No, that's just, just not the Jason I know. It's just not. [gun firing] [suspenseful music] For someone who did a lot of dumb and illegal shit, I find it fascinating that the only thing on your brother's record, up until this point of course, was a shoplifting charge. Apparently, Jason stole a dozen golf clubs. Did you also know that your little brother had a habit of telling people that you and him had a business together importing and exporting golf equipment? I think you helped Jason rob that golf store five years ago. -[David] Hey, how you doing? -Fine, how can I help you? Yeah, you know what? I'm looking for a couple new shirts. -[Clerk] Right this way. -[David] Great. Is there particular? Yeah, I took the price tags off of these clubs. I'm gonna make some new ones in fucking Microsoft Paint. Well, why would you do that? What are you talking about? I'm going to take these fucking clubs, and I'm going to scratch some fucking Chinese symbols into the head of them, and then we're gonna sell these motherfuckers to some dumb motherfucker with some deep ass pockets. Wait, do you think anybody's gonna fall for that shit? I mean, how stupid do you think people are? Ah, I think they're pretty fucking stupid. Plus bro, you forgot the most important part. What's that? -It's me. -Come on, bud. It's me, I could sell ice to a motherfucking Eskimo. Have another sip. -[laughing] -[siren blaring] Shit, shit! Shit. Oh, man. [laughing] Amy's gonna kill me. Amy's gonna fucking kill me. Dude, she's not going to fucking kill you. No, no, she's gonna call off the wedding. Okay, okay. I'm serious, dude. What are you doing, man? Ice to an Eskimo, bro. -What are you doing? -You owe me. How you doing? [soft suspenseful music] See this, huh? [man] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now remember kids, don't drink and drive. Anybody want to come sit on the captain's lap? I love my boat. Are you having a good time? We're here to have a good time. That's what we do. That's what we do! [engine humming] [engine humming] [gun clicking] [intensifying music] [gun firing] [people screaming] [gun firing] [indistinct chattering] [helicopter whirring] This was an execution. [bags rustling] For 56,000 dollars? There's our guy. [phone buzzing] Hello? [Melanie] Hey, I tried calling you this weekend. Hey, Mel, yeah. Sorry, I uh, I spent the weekend with my brother's family. [Melanie] That's okay, I just missed you. [helicopter whirring] Yeah, I missed you guys too. How's my little guy? [Zachary] Jason! Hey, buddy. You playing those games? [Zachary] Yeah, they're awesome. I was just playing Halo. -Nice. -[Zachary] It's so fun. Thanks so much. You got it, bud. You got it. Listen, tell your mom I'll call her later, okay? [bags rustling] [engine humming] [helicopter whirring] [police chopper] This is Chopper One calling dispatch. I found an abandoned mountain bike matching the description, over. Check it out. We got a partial. The match came through on the partial print. This is our prime suspect. [buttons beeping] [doorbell ringing] I'm outta here, okay? Okay. Smells good. Dinner is at? 5:30. -Five. -Five. Don't be late. -Love you. -Love you. Dad needs a hug. -[Kids] No! -Dad needs a hug, come here! Okay! Tighter, tighter. Too tight, too tight! Okay, see you guys. Listen to your mom. Can I say hi to my nieces? Actually they kind got a busy morning. -Are you serious? -Yeah. I need to ask you a favor. Yeah? Yeah. Not to borrow money, is it? No, no, it's not. You remember my silver BMW? -Yeah. -Yeah. I got it in my storage unit. I need you to, to go get the car and take it to the shop for me and have it detailed, like fully detailed, like carpets, seats, dashboard, everything. Why? Can't ask why. Come on, man. I will fully reimburse you the cost. Reimburse me? Come on, don't be an asshole. You know, I'm working on paying back. How am I being an asshole? How am I, how am I being an asshole? You owe me $20,000. So I think you can tell me why I need to go get this car detailed. Trust me. You don't want to know. I don't deserve to know that information? -Why? -You can't know that information. But you still want my help, huh? Jason, why do you always get yourself -in these situations, huh? -Don't lecture me right now. I'm not lecturing you. I'm asking you a question. Why do you keep getting yourself into these situations? And you float into town and you expect me to fix you. -Yeah, float into town. -Yes. I'm not in a situation that I want to be in. I don't have a lot of time. -So can you help me? -You know, I'm sorry. I don't think I can bail you out this time. Okay. I've got a family. Yeah, you got a family. Yes I do. You got a family. You got a family. You remember when we got pulled over before your wedding by that cop? Do you remember that? You remember what happened? You remember what you said to me? -What? -You said to me, "Oh, oh, oh Jason. I'm so scared. I'm so scared because if Amy finds out -she's gonna leave me. -Stop. She's gonna call off the ceremony." -Settle down. -So what did I do? -Settle down. -What did I do? -Settle down. -I'm fucking settled down. I manned up. I bit the bullet. I went out there, I got arrested. I did four days in county. That thing is still on my fucking record. What's your life now? Golf, country clubs, fucking nice restaurants, pictures on MySpace of your family vacations in Hawaii and Fiji. I'm out there roaming the country like a fucking immigrant. Huh? Your wife treats me like I'm fucking OJ Simpson. I don't get to see my fucking nieces. When I talk to you, I feel like I'm in a fucking court ordered, fucking supervised visit. I'm asking you for help. I really wish I could. Jason, wait. Wait, goddamn it! Wait! Give me the keys. Gimme the keys, gimme the keys. Okay, okay, okay. I love you. Stop. Jesus Christ, man. You know what this reminds me of, right? When's the last time you talked to dad? I don't know. What do you mean? It's a stupid question. Same time you did. How fucked up were you? Like, you know? It's okay, it's okay. It's not a problem. I'll handle it. Let's go, come on. [upbeat pop music] [Jason] Hey, Jamie. Guess who it is? Oh, my God, Jason! To my baby brother being back in town. To having a great night. And getting fucked up! Yeah! [upbeat rap music] Hey, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm great. Yeah? So happy you're here. [gun firing] [eerie music] [upbeat rap music] Hey, Jason. Hey, where you going? -What? -Where are you going? The bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I know, I heard you. All right. [loud snorting] -[suspenseful music] -[helicopter wheering] [banging on door] [snorting] Ah, ah. [upbeat rap music] [phone buzzing] Yo. [David] Jason, Jesus Christ man. What's up? [David] You're all over the news, man. What the fuck did you get me into? Jason, Jason? Hello? [motor buzzing] Yeah, he was here two days ago. He went golfing with my husband. [man] This was just a cold blooded ambush. The suspect was waiting for this man, and shot him multiple times as soon as he came out the door. [News Anchor] The Megaplex 20 was covered in crime scene tape this past Monday morning. The authorities are saying Jason Derek Brown ran up to Robert Keith Palomares, shot him multiple times and took off with a bag filled with $56,000. Brown fled the scene on a mountain bike, and ditched it in a nearby brush. He is six feet, has spiky blonde hair and green eyes. [siren blaring] [suspenseful music] [officer] Get down, get down! What is going on? Get the fuck off! Get off of me! [officer] One, two, three. [loud banging] I'm not fucking part of this, okay? -I'm not a fucking part of-- -Ma'am, calm down. -Where is your brother? -I don't know. Okay, I don't fucking know. Where do you think he is in the house? Is anyone else in there? [intensifying music] [Officer] All clear. House is clear, all personnel accounted for. I need you to tell me what kind of car your brother drove outta here, and do not fucking lie to me. [Jamie] Hey! What the hell is going on? I was just gonna call you. Yeah, I saw the news. Okay, what the fuck is going on? What's going on? It's nothing. Do you remember, do you remember my idiot friend, Kyle? It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. He's a fuck up. He's total loser. We hung out one night. We had too much to drink. He, he, he asked me to help him. Like, I don't know, like fucking rob armored truck. I told him he was crazy. I thought he was joking. Son of a bitch must have actually fucking done it. And now he is framing me. He's framing you? How the fuck is he framing you? Because... Because I sold him my gun for a couple hundred bucks. And the cops fucking linked it back to me. I don't know, this is fucked up. Listen, listen, hey. Listen, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about it. It's a fucking misunderstanding. I will take care of it. I will fix it, I will handle it. No, let me help you, okay? Jason, what can I do? -Nothing. -Let me help you. Trust me, no. Okay, you don't wanna be involved in this, really. How are you gonna fix it then, huh? I will call you from the road. Oh, listen, if the fucking cops call you, or if they come here looking for me, just tell them I wasn't here. Okay, to protect yourself. Jamie. No. -Jamie. -You fucking... Lied to me. -No, I just don't want you-- -Yes, you did. -I don't want you involved. -You fucking lied to me did you fucking kill that man? -No. -The fuck did you do? What in the fuck? You're a fucking liar. Who the fuck are you? You killed that man, didn't you? I'm not lying, okay? The gun is here. I did not kill that man, okay? I'm telling you the truth. The gun is here. I did not kill that man. I just don't want you involved in this. I don't know who the fuck you are. You're a fucking liar. The gun is here, I did not kill that man. I don't want you involved in this. I don't want you involved in this. I'll always tell you the truth. I love you sis, okay? Okay? Okay, I gotta go. No, don't, don't, don't, don't go. Don't... Don't run, okay? Jason, hey, no, no, no. Don't go, listen to me, listen, hey, hey, hey, hey! I know, I know you, I know you. You're better than this, you're better than this. I'm not, I'm not. I'm really not, I'm not. I'm not. [Leising] Jamie. It was a silver BMW. Find him. [car door slamming] [siren blaring] [Dispatch] All units be advised, suspect is driving a silver BMW. [engine humming] [somber music] [engine humming] [dramatic music] [sirens blaring] [officer] Driver, let me see your hands! What are you doing, David? Why is a smart and successful guy like yourself paying the price for what his scumbag of a brother did? [indistinct police radio chatter] Aiding and abetting a fugitive is five years. What the fuck. Obstruction of justice is another three. And with a case this high profile-- Man, I don't know where he is. Man, I can help you avoid jail time, but you've got to give me something. Something good. You're never going to find him, okay? You sure about that? Yes. 'Cause you never found our father. [engine revving] [indistinct police radio chatter] Jamie, come inside, quick. Are you all right? Have you heard from David? -No, I haven't. -I've been so worried about him. I haven't mom, I haven't heard from him. -Come on inside, come on. -Okay. Um, mom. Are you crazy? You lied to a federal agent. Make the call! I can't, mom, I can't do that. I can't do that to Jason. I can't just fucking betray him. Honey, I understand your loyalty to your brother. I do. But do you have any idea how much trouble you're in if they find out what you did? It's Jason! It's Jason, he's your son. That excuses what he did? That poor boy Jason killed, he was 24 years old. He had his whole life ahead of him. And for what? So Jason could have $56,000 to spend on bullshit. Honey... I know you wanna protect him. Yeah. [slow, somber music] In fact, maybe of all the people he hurt you're really actually the only one he ever cared about. That's not true. That's not true. Jamie, my darling. You asked for my advice. Your brother is poisonous. [Jamie sobbing] Sweetheart, call the agent, Jamie. Tell him you lied. [supervisor] Where are we on Jason? Well, he stopped using the credit cards, ditched the cell phone, and the Cadillac hasn't shown up yet. But, we're getting a lot of tips, which is promising. And I'm confident he's gonna turn up real soon. We're getting closer. You think so? Yeah, our guy's got a huge ego. He's not gonna stay hidden for too long. Time is on our side here. He won't get away with this. He won't. Get some sleep. [Jason] Birthday boy at your service. And remember kids, don't drink and drive. Whoo! [girls cheering] Here you go. Thank you, Jamie. I'll make sure this all gets back to you after we find him. I'm sorry, too, for lying to you about the car.
