The first Guru of Sikhs, Shri Guru Nanak Devji taught the world about humanity, equality and love, He taught everyone how to find happiness in their lives as they practiced the religion of their choice. But the Turkish and Mughal Invaders always thought themselves to be superior than any other kingdom in the world They were looting the country ruthlessly and were forcing their religion on all. Fearing the bloodshed, looting and conversion, the Kashmiri Pundits came rushing towards Guru Teg Bahadur for help. To everyone's amazement, the 8 year old Guru Gobind Singh stood up for the Kashmiri Pundits, and pleaded to his father Guru Teg Bahadur to fight against this injustice. Guru Teg Bahadur fought for the rights of the Kashmiri Pundits. He travelled to Delhi for their cause, for their "human rights”, even when this word was not coined, but Instead was beheaded by the Mughals. “The loot, torture and injustice never stopped... As the young Guru Gobind Singh grew up he took a decision. To stand up against injustice, fight for one's rights. He took to spreading knowledge to the world with his writings, and fight Injustice with his sword. In Shri Anandpur Sahib he created the Khalsa, the pure, the fearless, which shook the Mughal Empire from their slumber! He stood up for the truth, for people's rights and their freedom to practice a religion of their choice.... ...in the process sacrificed everything he had even his four sons! Shri Anandpur Sahib On one end the bursting river Satluj and on the other was the calm flowing River Sirsa reflecting the sky's deep blue shade. It was here in these beautiful meadows, that the four sons of Guru Sahib, grew up. amidst sounds of fun and laughter. They would rise with the beat of the naggada drums exciting everyone around who would look upon them in awe! Guru Father has asked you to make me sit on the white elephant and let us witness our brothers horse-racing He told you about me too Oh yes..he said to make Fateh Singh sit on it too! But no one told me.. Hurry up ! I can't see my brothers from here please move the elephant a little further Jujhar Singh! Look there! Both of them are coming towards the bridge This bridge. Oh no! it almost collapsed yesterday Jujhar Singh! Ride easy Shero easy we have to let the younger brother win Jujhar brother has won! Jujhar brother has won the race! Gulab Singhi you can help us get us down now But Guru Father hasn't instructed me to do that.. You can ride the horse very well now A Brahmin has come seeking for help, Guru Father has called for you Oh Grateful Guru, I have knocked many doors, asking for help, but no one has stood up for me.... we did not even consummate our marriage and that pathan abducted my newly-wed wife. Only you can help me now... No one who came seeking help from Guru Sahib ever went disappointed... As you wish Guru Father One Universal Creator God. By Guru's grace. Those heads adorned with braided hair, 'with their parts painted with vermillion those heads were shaved with scissors, and their throats were choked with dust. When our country was attacked by Babar, Shri Guru Nanak Devji, explains the plight of people in his writings.. ...how newly married women were tortured, others were widowed, how they were left with no where to go, Seeing the plight of people, and realizing their grief, Guru Sahib asked Babar, “does it not even pain you a bit seeing the massacre you have done?" Grandma, was Babar such a cruel man? Were people In his ruls so unhappy? Even the people under the rule of the King sitting In Delhi aren't happy either. Brother, are you talking about Aurangzeb ? Yes, lashing cruelty on his people has become a habit for him 'You seem to know a lot about the cruelty of the treacherous, but do you even remember the Gurbaani that your grandma has taught you or not? Gurbaani is so simple Guru Mother. It comes to you so effortlessly. Guru Mother, we will recite some for you I bow to the Primal Guru, I bow to the Guru of the ages. I bow to the True Guru. I bow to the Great, Divine Guru. Fateh and Zorawar are dolng well, How is your learning of Sanskrit and Parsi going? Guru mother, I can not only speak, but read and write in Sanskrit and Parsi too Guru Mother, he can now rice the horse very well too. Really? Very soon, a sword will be swaying in your son's hand. What are you thinking Guru Mother? My son, when you will be in full armour with a sword in hand would you look as gracious.. ..as your eider brother? Guru Mother I would obviously take your blessings before I go to war. So you can see for yourself how I look May God bless you with best art of warfare. How is your Gatka training? Oh Guru Mother, they always indulge me in their conversations Grandma can we... Okay go Devki Das Guru Father has told me ta Inform you that if someone tries to trouble your wife again, you should ready yourself to protect her. I promise Ajit Singh Ji I am very grateful to Guru Sahib that he sent you to help me and my wife May the Khalsa keep protecting everyone in need! Where had you vanished? Brother Jujhar is doing great today I had gone to tell Guru Father all about it Ajit Singh Ji, Jujhar Singh is on a rampage today. He is not even letting anyone close to him. My little brother is now ready to train as a warrior Brother, please let me learn sword fighting now, Master too thinks that I am ready for it... Yes Jujhar Singh's body movements are very swift, and controlled now In fact I have already learnt some of the moves with the sword on my own If you want I can display them Master. Okay. come Mehar Singh Hold on Give me the sword I would like to see what my little brother has learnt on his own Amazing! Wow! you have learnt well, you could block my strike One's focus in the battle should not be just to strike down your enemy but to protect yourself from being struck. So you should always keep your defence strong. Brother I think, now I am strong enough to make the enemy loose his sword in battle Is it? Mehar Singh Ji. He is ready now Start his training with no delay. But remember Brother the sword of Singh only rises to defend, never to attack. Now you should learn the Gatka quickly, only then will my turn come soon Brother! Oh Brother! please save me from brother Jujhar What's wrong? Oh Brother, he bit my hand. Look at this. Then why did you pull my ear? Because you put your hand smeared with spices in my eye Yes Brother. Look at his eyes, they're so watery Fateh Singh? Forgive me brother But you will have to get punished for this Now we will make his eyes watery too, by making him laugh continuously Hold on. Whare are you running now? Oh Brother...I'm not going to talk to you. You sided with brother Jujhar and did not take my side And how is that? You just believed what he said and then started tickling me You didn't even try putting my smeared hands with spice into your eyes, to check If it hurts or not? Brother, Fateh Singh is a clever little fellow, we must send him to Kashi to leam Sanskrit like the other learned ones No brother, I will never leave you all and go anywhere Okay, That's fine 'You would have to do voluntary service for fellowmen, Just like Bhai Kanhaiya had done Brother, once you were about to tell me something about Bhal Kanhaiya, what was it? May I, Brother? Once a Singh complained to Guru Father that Bhai Kanhaiya serves water to the Turkish soldiers after the battle, Bhal Kanhaiya came forward and said "Guruji . your Singh's fight to kill the enemy and I give them water to kill the animosity in them” Guru Father smiled and said "Kanhaiya, from now on, please take soms medical aid too! I too will become, a saint soldier like my Guru Father. when I grow up! What happened Gangu? I sent wheat crumbs with sugar and buter for the kids through you and you brought it back untouched ? What could I possibly do Mataji? All your Son's have locked themselves in the room and have ordered not to disturb them till dusk. Whenever the four of them get together, they always come with some surprise Mother dear. do you have any idea what they are up to this time? Tomorrow my grandchildren will sing hymns in praise of the Guru who brought enlightenment to this dark world. Waheguru Waheguru Waheguru Waheguru With the emergence of the true Guru Nanak.

Waheguru Waheguru Waheguru Waheguru I'm sure my grandchildren have made my son proud today. 1 wish such happiness stays with us for all times to come.. But these good times did not last long, the Mughals were forcing conversions and Guru Sahib's Khalsapanth would oppose it! People from all casts and relgion started to work closely with Guru Sahib and felt elated in following His path His increasing popularity and power was becoming a huge cancern amongst the Mughals and the Hindu Kings from the surrounding hill's provinces. Wazir Khan was sweating in the winters of North India. He just didn't know what to do. We have lost endless battles from the Guru and his Singhs Call for hundreds or thousands of men from Delhi and finish them off! Isn't there a way, where we can win this without going to war? By the death of Just one person the Khalsa would loose all it's motivation and crash into peices I understand my Lord but who would Dare to be able to slay the Guru ? The most ruthless and powerful General of the Mughal Empire - Painde Khan. Govind, why should we shed the blood of our soldiers? Let the two of us have a duel and settle this war right here! Guru Sahib asked for permission from The Five Chosen Ones Hmmm...get ready to fight Gobind! Bole so nihaal... sat sri akaal.... Make the first move Gobind! Guru sahib explained 'the Khalsa never attacks first. you have challenged Painde Khan, how can I make the first move?' No you have to make the first move Guru Sahib then told him 'Think it over Painde Khan it may so happen that your desire to attack me, may remain unfulfilled You may regret that.' Then defend yourself! Dina Begh Sahib Painde Khan's arrow has never missed its target. It's ready now to crush the Khalsa Before aiming his arrow Guru Sahib praved, "You are omnipresent God, You are there in every human being, but at this moment what stands before me, is someone's armogance' You can pray to god now Painde khan! I am covered from head to toe in my armor, does he really think his arrow can pierce me anywhere? What dose he think of himself, this Hind ka Pir Wazir khan had a nervous breakdown when he heard about the death of Painde khan He then focused on the Hindu Kings of the Hill States Wazir khan has sent a proposal, that we should join hands with him to finishing the rising power of Guru Gobind Singh We should definitely not align with that cunning Wazir Khan. Not against Guru Gobind We have lost all the battles we fought with Guru Gobind. and retreated every time And in spite of that he never took over a single piece of land from your Kingdom I am sure, that by doing that, there must be a trap he is setting. You are right if Wazir was not in panic, he wouldn't have sent this proposal We would agree to whatever you decide King Ajmer Chand “The Hindu Kings of the Hill States and the Mughals formed an alliance and surrounded the fort of Anandpur. The battle begun, six months passed by. Hard winters set in, the cold weather had the Mughals falling ill. Prolonged war had it their treasuries. Their armies had started to rebel. The situation in the fort was not any better, six months had gone by. rations had exhausted. Thers was very little food left. Not able to bear hunger anymore about 100 Sikhs decided to leave the Fort Guru Sahib sent his mother to attend to these Sikhs Your Guru has accepted your plea You just have to write on this paper that you are no more his Singh's and he is not your Guru anymore. We are ready to wiits There is nothing but famine and death left in this fort now It's better to leave the fort now If there is any other Singh who does not want to be Singh anymore, He can leave with them Out of the 100 who wanted to leave only 40 left. The conscience of the rest did not allow them to leave Sipah-e-Silhar i can see some Sikhs there. Hold on seems like they are fleeing away from the fort let them go I think you are right, Sir Before our army rebels and the siege breaks wish all the Sikhs flee and we win the Fort. Even after betraying once, Wazir khan had the audacity to send another proposal through Emissary for ceasefire, Mughals swore by their religion and the Hindu Kings swore by the Holy Cow. That if Guru Gobind Singh leaves the fort they would never trespass his way ever again and that he's free 1090 anywhere. Guru Sahib, upen request from his core team accepted this offer and decided to empty the Anandpur Fort. Zorawar Singh, Fateh Singh. Hurry up, mother is waiting for you. Brother Ajit we want to stay with you You should stay with your Guru Mother and Grandma...take care of them Then you should come with us too. All of us will take care of them. No little brother, we will be in the last flank of the convoy to ensure everyone is protected, Now we would meet wherever we set our camp next And if you don't turn up? Wherever you both will go, we will fellow you... Okay fine. Lat's go now Brother, I feel like hugging you tight. Me too... The brothers stood hugging, what a moment it was to be! The stars were wondering and the skies locked down quietly They were going their separate ways. From Anandpur. Leaving their home forever, in pairs of two... How unfortunate, they were parting never to meet again The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's My Lord Khan, as agreed, the Guru and his Sikhs have emptied the Fort peacefully for us What am I going to do with the damned fort? All I wanted was for Gobind to be out of his Fort in the open. Your wish has been fulilled, what are you waiting for? We cannot do this Sirl We swore by our religion and they swore by the Holy Cow Swore? As soon as they cross the border of Kiratpur, strike them from the back! I want the Guru Killed and don't leave a single Singh alive! Wazir Khan and the Hindu Kings have betrayed us! Again, thousands of soldiers are following us No problem. We will stop them But how? Ajit Singh Ji we are in hundreds and they are In thousands... Look at that gorgs in the mountains There is no way that thousands of men can pass through it, in one go My dear fellow men, it's just before day-break, Guru Sahib has said that we should recite the hymns from “Asaa & vaar” Brother Mokham Singh! -yes? Another group of Mughal and Rajput soldiers are corming our way! These two brothers should not be here Ajit Singh, I think that the enemy can take another route and attack our fellowmen by the river. We should go and check You go ahead. I will follow you Drop that rock onto the passage to narrow it Where are we heading? We are going towards the banks of Sirsa, to check if all is safe Get lost you... Waheguru Ji ka khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki faten. Bhai Daya Singh we have lost more than half our Singhs 'You have the women and children with you, the waters of the Sirsa are rising! You should start crossing the river and take Ajit Singh with you. Ajit Singh didn't turn up, I have to get him out of that war Create a wall right here! None shall pass towards the river banks Brother Ajit Singh, the waters of Sirsa are rising Guru Father has called for you. Okay. Be careful the current is strong down under. One mistake and you will bs washed away We are not able to break into the Singhs defense. Go on the hill top and attack from behind! Bhai Sahib Singh Ji we have been attacked from behind! Come! Bole so nihaal... Careful! It dangerous to cross Sirsa as of now. 'We should take the 'bridge and follow them Mata Ji, Sirsa held on to the fateful four Sirsa held on to the fateful four We looked all around but did not see anyone Bhai Mani Singh, I think we should head towards Delhi now Though Her strong currents ware cruel 1 will go and check once again. Maybe I'll find someone. Brother Ajit or someone We shouldn't stay here for long. We should leave this place immediately Come on kids! Gangu is right. As God wishes so it be The ones that she wanted to cross aver Sirsa did not let them drown... They must have waited but sensing the danger. Must have left for Delhi as we had decided earlier Yes. 'We've been asked to head towards 'Bur Majra' via 'Kotla Nihang' Had the waters of the Sirsa River remained calm Had the waters of the Sirsa River remained calm that day history would have been different. Guru Sahib's Family got separated His mother walked with Gangu to his village Kheri, Guru Sahib camped in the mud Fort of Chaudhary Budu Chand, from where He had earlier fought a battle too. This fort is at a good height and it has 4 gates it will be impossible for the enemy to attack from these three steep gates So its only this main gate which we need to watch there are bushes 'and small mounds outside this gate,. Though we should patrol and take guard on all the gates. We need to guard this gate carefully If the enemy strikes this is where it is going to be. Himmat Singh Ji, we have placed cur soldiers to guard all the four entrances to the mud fort. But our resources are limited. But our courage is unlimited! Pleased to hear that! Good we picked up more weapons on our way here You're right! Come let's go and meet Guru Father See this. Guru Father Just as you said, we have placed soldiers all around the Mud Fort. Guru Sahib as you had asked the injured Singhs are being given first aid as we speak We will keep a close watch from this Fort “The Mughal Army can be here any time now Ajit Singh, we had almost forgotten about our "sharpest lookout". Listen very carefully - People of Chamkour! Listen carefully This is a message from the King of our land and his Governor Wazir khan Listen carefully!! Guru Of Anandpur and his Singhs have taken refuge in the Mud Fort of Chamkour The Governor has warned that any person who tries to help the Guru or his Singhs shall be beheaded, My child! I made these butter wheat crumbs especially for you, where are u taking them? Mother, the Guru of Anandpur and his Singhs have come to the Mud Fort. Everyone is taking something for them So I decided to take this. Oh no my child! Please don't do that. Who knows what trouble you will get us into? Why not? Why are you trying to scare the child? He is doing such a noble deed. You go ahead dear I'm leaving Grandma You are trying to make your child like those 40 coward Sikhs 'who left the Guru in his Fort, Do you know when they wet back home what humiliation they faced from their families? Here take these bangles and wear them!! Sit and cook! Here give me your sword this Guru's "Singhni' will go and fight for him in the battlefield - But listen - Don't touch me. Agaln, the one who cant be a 'Singh' of the Guru cannot be a 'Singh' of this 'Singhnl* I am going to fight his foes on my own You Idiot! 'You offered your head to the Guru and was baptized by the him to be a Singh, to fight Injustice! And you left him and ran back home You 40 ran back to the comforts of your home? Mata Gujri son was also as hungry as you. It seems you cowards were not worthy to live in the lions den Went to become better beings Forgive me mother, the love for my own child had made me weak and I forgot what the principles we Singhs stand for. Before this warning call of the guard scares another mother like me... Listen carefully pacple of Chamkour This is a message from the King of our land and his Governor... Oh God! Please have mercy 'Bhag Singh Ji lock there! Two kids in the cover of bushes are coming towards this Mud Fort Come! Let's have a look Hmm... Who are you? We heard that the Guru of Anandpur has come again to this Mud Fort so I got some sweet wheat crumbs for him and I some butter-sugar But the Mughals have warned the villagers not to help us Weren't you scared? If Guru Sahib does not fear the Mughals, then we too don't fear them Singh Ji please take their contribution and give it Guru Father immediately Sure Who is this? He is the Guru's younger son Really? Consider us like your younger brothers. allow us to join your army too. Brother You did not reply? 'You cared for our need for food, took the risk of coming here, this deed is no less than that of a true soldier. Bhag Slngh Ji Please make sure these two young soldiers reach their houses safely Almost there Mata Ji, it must be less than half a mile now. Look! There it is! Kumma! Hey Kumma! What's troubling you Jujhar Singh I was just missing our younger brothers Why had waters of the Sirsa river to rise today only, it separated us all Don't you worry little brother, Guru Mother and some Singh's are with them. They probably have reached Delhi by now! Gangu be careful, Take the narrow pathway next to the river It will lead you straight to your village But isn't the wider road a better way? It's short as well But the risk is greater. The Mughal army patrols frequently on that road O'Gangu, Kumma ls tight So what if it's a difficult path but we should be careful and safe. When would we be with our Guru Father, Guru Mother and our brothers Grandma We all have gone different ways to confuse the enemy The moment the area ls secure our brothers will come to fetch us, isn't it grandma? 1 just hope thay all are safe and secure. Sube Sirhind zindabad , Maan Singh Ji, what do you think is the strength of the Mughal soldiers? Approximately one milion One million to fight us 42. Mughals surely are terrorized by the power of the Singh's! Well said Juhar! I knew you were intelligent and smart but now it seems that you have a lot of wisdom too Sva laakh se aik ladao, tabhe Gobind Singh naam kahaun! Let's show them now how one Sikh fights more than 2 hundred thousand alone Bole so nlhal, sat sri akaal Naban mian, You told me that they are just a handful of Singh's in there I heard there were only 100 my lord But their 'Jakara' almost deafened my ears. I think they are more than that... Maybe more joined them How many more 100...500...a thousand? We are a million I am going over to discuss this with Wazir Khan in his marquee You can leave. All I know is that not a single one of them will live to see another day Guru Sahib is all knowing How could he sleep that night? In deep thoughts the Guru walked to where his Singhs were resting... Just like a father would come to care of his children while they're asleep He walked slowly, taking steps as soft as he could He was touched by the unconditional love shown by them. He looked upon all of them, showering his blessings These Singhs were going to brace death as the Sun rose These Khalsa's were going to be martyred in the battle soon. Engrossed watching his Singh's as he moved further, He saw his two sons in deep sleep just like others As he moved further from where they slept He paused, looked back, stood and watched them thinking "Sons, you will be at rest before the Sun sets tomorrow Your souls will find eternal peace in God's own arms” O Waheguru! We do not hesitate to die fighting injustice As Our body, soul, all belong to you, nothing is ours He sat watching, observing, caressing his sons Just as one would, appreciating a bunch of flowers He walked on further caring and treating their wounds Comforting his Singhs, 'Buckling them in their blankets One has never seen such heart rendering moments Neither has one heard of such soul stirring occurrences O! One can swear by the Lord and Nanak himself, How much ever you may sing in praise of Guru Gobind, Its never enough! Soldiers Attack! Cover your heads with shields! Shoot the arrows! Do not stop firing arrows at them, Such that Singhs cannot come out from the Fort and shoot arrows, and our men can reach it Shoot the arrows! Brother... Let's go to the corners of the Fort and shoot arrows at their legs. Hold your arrows! Do not Shoot! You might injure our men Move ahead! Nihar! Hold on We will have to change our strategy. 1 gave you mnilion soldiers Khwaza Mohammad and you couldn't capture handful of Singhs ? Now go with your full strength and kill them all My Lord they are sitting at a height, hence we have a disadvantage. If we attack them head on with all our soldiers 'we would lose at least 20 thousand men No.. no. That's too big a number! Wait Let me think about It Hmm.. Do as I say! Station your men at least 10 meters away from the range of their arrows Singhs will have only two options then Either they would come out of the Fort to fight and will be ripped apart by our archers before they can reach us, or they would come out with their Guru to plead for mercy before me It's time for us to die for our honor. The Mughals have surrounded the entire Fort They know that we do not have enough food and arms with us Guru Sahib has ordered that we will go out of the Fort and fight them! Fine with us! We all go together attack them head on. We will easily kill at least hundreds of them Not hundreds! We would stay thousands but the way our Guru Father has commended We will go out in groups of 5 to fight the Mughals They would have never even imagined how deathly we will be for them 1 would lead the first group. Any four of you can get ready to come with me We are ready!! Easy, we need to take advantage of the fog and reach the enemy I think Singh's ars coming, go check, I don't think so, you go. You Idiots, why are you fighting amongst yourselves. Shut the roar of this Singh! This was the hut ws ware told about Anybody there? Seems someone has been here Yes. My Lord Have you seen any family member of the Guru of Anandpur or his Singhs ? A while ago one of your army units had come here and they wers asking the same quastion and I told them that I have not seen any Singh's here It might have been Bashir Khan's unit Come! Then lets take the shorter way along the river We will get to them faster The shorter way... Hey Almighty, protect them. Mata Ji you should rest here for a while. Fateh Singh? What is troubling you Fateh Singh 7 Grandma, I am missing my Mother Even I am missing her Not Guru Mother will be with both our brothers and Guru Father too right Grandma? Yes my child hopefully Grandma, she too would be missing us. What happened my Lady? Don't you warry my Lady, I am sure they are safe and sound. They four cannot live without each other Hey Almighty, please protect them Bhai Daya Singh, Three units have gone out of the Fort to fight I will take the next unit with me, after my prayers I will go and take Guru Father's blessing and be back here! Please wait Ajit Singh Ji You cannot step into this war And why can't I do that? It will be a great loss for all of us if you go to this battle Do not see me apart from the other Singhs Bahi Daya Singh Our clan does not acknowledge any such relations I know my Guru Father too well He would open the gates of this Fort himself to send me to the battle He will not listen to any one of Us, only Guru Sahib can stop him now Hold your hearts from pain And hide your tears, Hear the story of Gujri's grand children Fought the tyrants They came to protect us Came to enlighten our souls The sons of the Lord The sword Is heavy Yes , that's why I am going to carry Guru Father's smaller sword to battle. The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's “The Four Princes, the Four Prince's “The Four Princes, the Four Prince's Guru Sahib, we had put forth plea before you, but you haven't replied to us as yet. Guru Father, 1 am ready to go to battle Ajit Singh you cannot. My name is Ajit, will let no one win over me, but if someone does, it'll be only when I am no more! Bless me Guru Father. By sending Ajit Singh to battle. Guru Gobind Singh let everyone know that he kept no difference between his Singh's and his sons. They were all the sons of the Khalsa and when the need arose, they could fight unto death! O Lord grant me this boon, this gift that nothing can deter me from doing good deeds I should have no fear of the enemy when I fight in the battlefield I should have this faith that the victory is mine Attack! Move ahead! Surround him. Soldiers shoot the arrows! The wartior Ajit Singh fought with exemplary valour He then stood looking At his brother in the Mud Fort Who, He knew was in a hurry too So Showed the right path Waheguru ! To his own young brother To attain martyrdom... The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's The four Prince's, the Four Prince's The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's Here you go Dear Listen... Buy whatever you need for the house with this. If you need any more money you can ask me for it Hold onto that Mata Ji all we have here is yours only Don't take this trouble, please. Be comfortable, I'll prepare some food Guru Sahib, the events at the Sirsa river were very unfortunate. Mata Ji and the little ones are no where to be found Ajit Singh has been martyred. And yet you are so calm and composed. People in this world struggle to find ways to survive and your inspiration encourages Singhs to brace martyrdom while fighting injustice, All hopes are now on Jujhar Singh, to lead the Khalsa with utmost brilliance. Guru Father, I too want to go to battle like my brother No! Jughar No! Do not say that. You are too young to go to battle. Guru Sahib, you must not allow this. I will ask Seva Singh to lead the next unit Bhai Daya Singh, I might not know all the traits of sword fighting vet but I can easily slay a handful of 8-10 men before I fall! Guru Father I need your blessings. Guru Father I need your blessings. Then his own father Armoured his son Pracious treasure of his own He let go He who says so is blessed.. "Truth Is God” 'What are you thinking Guru Mother?' 'My Son, when in full armour with a sword in hand' 'would you lock as gracious..' '..as your sider brother?' 'I would obviously take your blessings before I go to war,' 'so you can then see for yourself how I look' Guru Mother.. you've come here? Yes, I wanted to see you before you step into the battlefield While I was taking the blessing from Guru Father, I was hoping that my Guru Mother would also be with me, so that I could take her blessings too before I go to battle I hope you aren't scared Scared? I think I am going to scare the Mughals today I am proud of you today. My son is going to step into the battiefield as a soldier Guru Mother, I sees tears In your eyes They are not tears, they are my blessings As He commands, so they exist. O Nanak, True is the Creation of the True Lord. Attack! Move forward! This is the Guru's second son Come let's play 'Gatka'. You are still just a kid you fool and you have come to fight us knights ? I have Killed many already, will take down at least 20 more O you son of the Guru So that's it? you said you would kill 20?! Bole so Nihaal Sat Sri Akaal Guru Gobind then saw his own sons martyred In the battiefleld He then recalled the words Of Gurbani Nothing Is mine within myself Whatever there is, is Yours, O Lord If I surrender to You what is already Yours, What does It cost me? His Sons have sacrificad for a cause, He is thankful to the Lord for this. It was the Lord who blessed him with them He has let them be so for Lords own call. The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's The Four Prince's, the Four Prince's Gangu Gangu Gangu Mata Ji, I think someone has stolen your bag of mohurs Not a problem Gangu, maybe his need is more than mine But that bag had all your valuables Oh no my child, My valuables are right here with me But I think , I will go and lodge a complaint with the kotwal No need, my dear In fact, nowadays the people in kotwall's are bigger thieves than burglars As you wish mata ji If the authority turns up. they will take away my valuables. What the Singhs said is true, a clenched fist is more powerful than an open palm The Guru definitely has some divine power in him There is no such thing as divine power. Wars are won with courage. Ask Wazir Khan to send his sons to a battlefield! There is no movement in the Mughal Amy. My Lord Guru Sahib has decided that he too will step onto the battlefield tomorrow. No Sangat Singh, we cannot let this happen We have to stop him from doing so at any cost Bhai Daya Singh, Guru Sahib first baptized the Five Singhs and established the Khalsa? Right! So that means The Five chosen ones represent the Khalsa? And the Khalsa represents them? Of course That's great! So we should go to Guru Sahib and tell him that if you are there the Khalsa clan will be, and for us Singhs the Khalsa clan is everything Khalsa is Guru and the Guru is Khalsa for us Guru Sahib when you baptized The Chosen Five, you gave them the authority, that if and when the need arises for a decision in matter of the panth, the decision of The Chosen Five will be supreme. So we, The Chose Five, keeping in mind your democratic principles. in the supreme interest of the panth ask you leave the Mud Fort Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji ki Fateh. That night Guru Gokind made one of his Singhs wear his clothes and he himself dressed in a common man's attire left the Fort. With him were Bhai Daya Singh, bhai Dharam Singh and Bhal Maan Singh But before leaving, he announced his departure, clapped aloud thrice and said, "Pir of Hind is leaving, stop him if you have the courage to” After Hearing these words, the Mughals were flustered Who is It? Who Is there? Did you hear it? Oh, I can't see anything. I cant even hear properly It was a dark night that day No one got to know what happened I think I heard it clearly, I will go tell the Commander about this! The next day a fierce battle took place in Chiamkour. When the Singh who wore the Guru's clothes was killed, the Commander thought he had killed the Guru himself. Wazir Khan was dancing with joy. You Fools! This is not the Guru! Its somebody else Go and search for him in the entire Fort My lord! There is no one else in the fort except for the Guru's blue horse and four Arab horses This means that he has again escaped quietly in the night before we could catch him Forgive me, My Lord. But the Guru said aloud, when he left I clearly heard him saying "Pir of Hind is leaving, stop him if you have the courage to" I told the Commander the moment. I heard it. Why didn't you come to me? Now go and search him in the entire area! I want him dead or alive! I'll make him my slave and force him to wear the Turkish turban. Huh!! Soldiers what are you waiting For?? Kill the Guru's eagle He has disrespected you. we won't leave him Him Huh! Here you go children, your milk Grandmother, has Gangu come back after giving our message to brother Ajit singh?

And he thinks he has done a great job by catching his mother and his two kids and is showcasing them in public Hey, Waheguru The one who tortures the women and children is a monster and not a warrior. And he is making us do this dirty job, it would have been so much better had he called us to find the Guru in Chamkour Hey, where do you think you're going? To the next village to meet someone there What is your name? Bhaago, it Bhaago Have any of you seen the Guru of Anandpur? Yes, I see him day and Night. I saw him just now Where?

Without You, rich blankets are a disease and the comfort of the house is like living with snakes. Like living with snakes. Tell the beloved friend (the Lord) the plight of his disciples. Our water pitchers are like stakes of torture and our cups have edges like daggers. Your neglect is like the suffering of animals at the hands of butchers.

Our Beloved Lord's straw bed is more pleasing to us Our Beloved Lord's straw bed is more pleasing to us than living in costly furnace-like mansions. Than living in costly furnace-like mansions. Tell the beloved friend (the Lord) the plight of his disciples. When all the three Singhs reached Guru Sahib, they thanked the Lord. When they saw his wounded feet and his torn robe their smiles disappeared When they saw his wounded feet and his torn robe their smiles disappeared Speak Mirza My Lord! Where should we keep the kids and mother of the Guru? Do you think these are some royal guests from Delhi, whom we would cater to? Go and throw them into the cold Burz we have! Forgive me, My Lord. But the cold Burzis a place where the bravest and toughest of men turn blue due to the freezing air! I don't think you've heard, the Singhs say that they are hot blooded, if that is the case then they should not feel the cold there! O' yes and they are the heirs of 'Hind da Peer'! They have everything You show no mercy on them, give them nothing at all. No bed to sleep, no water, not even a piece of bread! The wall is waiting, the cold tower is calling Grandma is hiding tears, bit seems helpless. Grandmother, you being the mother of our Guru Father. yet you look worried? Look at us! We are his children and we do not fear anything You have only taught us, that whatever Waheguru does, we should accept it with a smile. Fatah Singh, come Ms remind Grandma her own words! Everything that the Almighty does is good for us, Nothing happens without his command. If something unfortunate happens, there is always some good behind it, but we don't understand It, and we tend to overlook it , hence, feel saddened. If you remember each and every word that I have taught you my little ones, Then I shall never forget that you are my son's children and I his mother Sir Ji Mirza, I wanted a small favour from you and I shall give you anything you wish for this If you're ready to give anything Moti . then I am ready to listen to anything that you say Sir Mirza, I want to give some milk to Guru's mother and his kids Okay give me the 'real' cream and you can take the milk Okay Hey Moti! Stop there, this cream will not churn out any butter! Go back now! My Lord, this is all that I can offer today, tomorrow I'll get all the jewelry of my wife Better get your wife's jewelry, but that would be counted in today's account. What about tomorrow? I will arrange for something Get that jewelry tomorrow for sure! Now go! Oh Almighty! Thank you for letting me serve Guru's mother and his kids Mata Ji, I have got some milk for you and the kids please accept Moti's Small humble service Moti, I hope that by doing so you are not Putfing yourself in some kind of danger O c'mon Maata Ji, I am honored that I have got the chance to serve you You have to promise me that till you are here you will let me serve you. I take your leave. Okay Motl! Dear Son, do you have any information about my son Gobind? What wouldn't He know, he keeps information about everything, How would a layman like me know his Whereabouts. All I heard was a fierce battle was fought in Chamkour Who won, who lost, I've no news, Mata Ji, there is one. thing I did not understand What is It? On one hand, 'Wazir Khan's soldiers are hunting. all over for Guru Sahib to slay him to his death, and on the other hand , two Muslim brother's from the same area felt honored by taking him into their house and caring for him, Good souls for sure! There are many more such people and many such believe in Guru Sahib's teachings Hundreds of them are in his army and a lot of them are even commanders too. Guru Sahib is not against any Muslim or Islam. He only opposes the King and his men, who are forcing people to convert into their religion and are looting the wealth of those who stand up against them. Guru Sahib's fight with Aurangzeb and his Governor Wazir Khan, is not a fight between Sikhs and a Muslim but instead is the fight between good and evil, which will always be there. By preaching about good and evil you have enlightened the souls of 50 many Singh's. The Khalsa will always be grateful to you for this. I am just an insignificant soldier of my Guru, my focus is on his command, He just has to instruct me and I will pounce on the enemy like a lioness! Khan Sahib, arresting old women and children is against our principles. Did they come to Sirhind and rebel against you? What sin have they comitted? Their sin is that they are the mother and children of Gobind, the rebel. He has created chaos in this province that I command I have captured his family so that I can barter his arrest. Be careful, let no harm come to his family in any way! If any harm does come to them, then unfortunately we will be forced to complain about you to Delhi Hmm... Kazi Sahib do something... But I haad some valid reason to do so... Their father is a rebel not the children, so I can't issue their death warrant and hand it over to you But I cannot let this chance go. There is one way out, Where you won't need to get their warrant and I wouldn' need to issue one. What did you say? And you will be able take your revenge from Gobind! How is that? If we can make the children agree to convert to our religion Yes, if his own children accept our religion then this would be a shameful defeat for the Guru But why can't I go along with the kids... Don't be stubborn old lady! 1 am only doing what I am ordered to do. Come on now! What are you waiting For? Teke the kids with you! Move! My Lord, it has been planned Just the way you wanted. It will all happen, as you wished. I have closed the big gate and opened the smaller one. The soldiers are getting the children here, our soldiers will bow their heads in order to enter, the children would see them and follow suit. The children of the Guru of Sikh's shall bow down to the great and mighty Nawab Wazlr Khan Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa. Waheguru Ji ki Fatah. What did the children say? Everyone salutes the Lord with a 'salaam' here These kids have made a terrible mistake! This is the court of The Governor of Sirhind, Wazir khan, no one can come here and speak in praise of any Guru. Come on, little ones apologise to the Nawab, bow your heads and salute him. We believe In the Almighty God, we only bow down to His Greatness He who lives inside all of us, apart from Him, we do not bow down to anybody! You Kaflr, non-believer! Kafir is the one who forces others to change their religion Kafir is the one who misuses his power to do wrong The one who is honest is a real muslim One who is cunning, a cheater Is a Kafir! You have smartly and indirectly termed us as cheaters! You will now teach us about our own religion? We only know of our Sikh refigion Kazi Sahib and It does not believe In any slavery. This is what our Guru Father has taught us! Children, I have sent hundreds of soldiers in all directions to capture your father Just as the rays of the Sun cannot be captured. There is not one born yet, who can capture our father! He has such a radiance around him that everyone who looks upon him bows n salutes him, the day you will be face to face with Him You would also do the same. What happened Khan Sahib? Seems like you just experienced our Guru Father Quiet!! That's not fair! He not worthy of being the Governer Children, you should stay with us now I promise that you wil get everything you want, and where would you go now? Maybe you don' know, but Anandpur is in ruins and we would soon be arresting your Father, your elder brother's Ajit and Jujhar have been killed in the Battle of Chamkour How can we believe you, your intentions seem very foul to us Khan Sahib We have committed no crime. yet you have us in your custody Khan Sahib has advised correctly you should accept his religion, or else you too will die like your brothers. The first thing we are taught In our religion is to overcome the fear of death, so you cannot scare us with it! O, Dear children! Talk about life and not death. We would give you everything you ever wanted. We would give you a gorgeous palace to live in, you would have all the luxuries that a Prince would have, if I am forgetting something you can remind me? Sure I will I will ramind you what my late Grandfather Guru Teg Bahadur had said once to the Kashmiri Pundit's who were also being forced to convert their religion. My grandfather said tell those ruthless rulers, make the Guru convert his religion first and if he agrees then you all would also convert into their religion willingly. Yes, I remember! Yes, so what? So whose Grandfather, gave his own life to save someone else's religion, you are asking his grandchildren to convert to your religion? Think again! Maybe you are making a mistake somewhere! Your Grandfather's widow, I mean your Grandmother is still alive. I think it's best that you go and discuss this with her, You have time until tomorrow! Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji ki Fateh The kids dumbfounded evearyones here These are no nomal kids The one who helped capture the enemy's family - Gangu, come over to collect your Royal Reward. Her eyes are tired waiting A Mother's heart yearns... Grandma has It the tower with two wonderful souls The wicked tried their best But her children held ground The lights of this tower enlightened all around The Four Prince's... These are no nomal kids These are no nomal kids 1 don't think they are going to accept I will make them accept it! Khan Sahib, do not forget you have to seek the approval of The Council before you take any action against them. Khan Sahib, do appreciate my brain wave Call for the Nawab of Malerkotla to The Court tomorrow, he had lost his brother Khajar Khan in the battle with the Singhs in Ropar and his second brother Nihar Khan was killed by the Guru himself in Charmkour. Why didn't I think of this earlier? He will be more than happy to do this task! Dear, have you put the milk in the container for Mata Ji and the children? Slightly thickening the milk today, I have put some dates and cardamom in it too. Have you picked the jewelry from the ledge? What happened? Why are you quite? Mirza will account this Jewelry for yesterday's bribe. What do I give him today? You can give him this houss, we can go to a Temple and stay there! But for God's sake make sure there isn't any hitch in this service of milk, My child, Moti, seeing your affection towards the children, I would pray to God that he truly rewards you for this service of yours O Mata Ji, It's your blessing and wishes that I need, they will go with me a long way, There is nothing else one takes to heaven, I take your leave - God bless you - Thank you So children, you never told me what exactly happened at the court today? Nothing much Grandma We ofourse remember the sacrifice our Grandfather made but they had forgotten it, so we reminded them of It. Grandma they were scaring us, thinking we are little kids! They asked us to choose: death or their religion To scare us even further, they even said that both our brothers have been killed in the battle at Chamkour 'A fierce battle was fought in Chamkour' 'who won, who lost, I've no news.' Grandma? My children. You are right, they were just blabbering, pay no heed to it. We will be meeting them soon. Today, we have Nawab Malerkotla Janab - 'Sher Mohammad Khan present in The Court! Not just ons, but two of his brothers were brutally killed by Guru Gobkind Singh, their father. Do you know why your father brutally Killed Nawab's brothers? They must have made a mistake, his brothers! You little brats, you have no manners! You, are a powerful Governer, yet you are shamelessly cunning and mean Rudeness can be punished with death Death is acceptable! But we wouldn't cow down! Don't you fear death? Don't you fear God? Watch what you say, fearlessly Yes, fearless we live, fearless we die because we are the Guru's Singhs Hmmmm Singh? Yes, the one who does what is right is a Singh! The one who takes away sadness and brings happiness to others is a Singh! The one who becomes the strength of the weak is 2 Singh The one who is ready to sacrifice his life fighting for justice is a Singh! O'you Singhs! His brother's were also fighting for justice, when your father killed them in the battlefeild In the battle right? That isn't getting killed, It's known as sacrifice! And by not calling it so, you are insulting the sculs of the martyrs you speak of Manipulation of words and phrases is not going to cover up your fathers crimes. You will be punished for his deeds, which shall be decided by Nawab Malerkotla on whose mercy you are now Let the court know Naswal Sahib, what punishment would you want to give to your culprits?! I want to take revenge from Gobind for killing my brothers, and that I shall definitely do, but in the battlefield! They are not my culprits Revenge is never taken on women and children. In fact, I have a request, we should free the mother and kids of Gobind Nawab Sahib today you have proved that an honest man is a Muslim In Its true sense 1100 believe in justice my friends. As requested by the Nawab and sensing the will of the pubic, I would free them both. But I want to ask them one thing. what will they do once they are freed? We would do the same thing what our Guru Father Is doing. 2nd what the next generations of Singhs would do What is that? We would fight cruelty and injustice to our last breath How? We would re-group all the Singhs of our Guru Father and build an army again Did you hear? Did you all hear this? Their rebellious plan? They want to do the same thing what their rebel father is doing against us. So now tell me, wise members of The Council! Sitting here, what do you have to say for these children who are eager to rebel against our Empire? Khan Sahib, I think everyone has to say just one thing now! Son's of a snake will always be a snake! Suchanand, hold your tongue there! He is a friend of the weak known for his noble deeds. Bow down In respect to Him! Guru Gobind Singh is his name! You are lucky that we are your prisoners, otherwise I swear by Almighty your body would have lost its head by now That's it! I do not want to listen anymore! Children of the rebellious Gobind, accept our religion now!! Or be ready for a brutal execution! First, accept death, and give up any hope of life. Become the dust of the feet of all and then, you may come to me. Kazi Sahib. the sentence The sentence- fatwa is ready, My Lord Crush It fast! Where are you going old lady Bury them alive in a wall Oh God! Save the Empire, from the events that would follow Mata Ji! This is it! You can't go further! Come with us The Kazi has issued a warrant, tomorrow both the kids will be buried in the wall alive... But the kids are totally calm and composed Maybe they did not understand the sentence This is yet another new way to Kill a prisoner Did you hear? Yes, yes, the kids have been tricked into this My friend this is a sin, it's a mistake God will never forgive them for this! Nawab Sahib, no worker is ready to bury the kids into the wall tomorrow... But there are two fellows in our prison, Shashan Beg and Bashan Beg. Who are willing to do so only if we free them from the prison, afterwards Go tell them, They shall be free! Surely My Lord! I would surely do that Grandma, we did all our prayers, Moti also came and gave us our milk for the day. but you never asked what happened at The Court today? Children, unjust allegations and unfair questions Whatever happened today we are very happy about it You are happy? What is it that makes you happy?
