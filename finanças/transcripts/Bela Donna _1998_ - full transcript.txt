[dramatic music] [triumphant music] [wind whistling] [music box clicking] [gentle music box music] [Ana Mae chanting in foreign language] [Ana Mae praying in foreign language] [wind howling] [gentle hopeful music] [dramatic pensive music] [ships bell ringing] [gentle pensive music] [ship horn blaring] - Do you mind? - Not at all. - For the love of God, doctor, a cigar in this tight space, you of all people, a doctor. - Doesn't bother me. I like the way they smell. In fact, I think you should let me light it for you. [lighter clicks] - Perhaps it doesn't bother her, but it bothers me. A doctor should set an example. - Did you know that all the great healers smoke cigars or pipes? - I had imagined that you were something more than a healer. I had thought of you as a man of science. - Doctor, healer, it's all the same. But cigar smoke is like incense, it cleans the air. [Father scoffs] - What a ridiculous comparison. Incense purifies, this poisons. - Well, then maybe you could tell us a bit more about Brazil. - Well it's as if there were many countries, all in one. You and your wife are going to the most backward region, where everything is yet to be done. As I said, it's very hot and the people are rather lazy. Although I ask myself, if they're not wiser, then we are with our foolish forecasts, our petty ambitions, that have once again, brought us to the brink of terrible war. - Brink? We are already at war. - You really think so, Captain? - War has not been declared yet. Consequently, there's still hope. - Really, father, a little smoke to clear your head. [Doctor exhales loudly] - I say there is hope, but I can see the dark clouds that cover up poor Europe. You two make a beautiful couple, and you are going to live in an oasis of peace. Remember, Frank, and you too, Donna, that millions will live in a world filled with hatred, death, and destruction. Remember that every time you feel superior to those poor, peace-loving natives. - Peace loving? They are savages, capable of stabbing each other for nothing. - Captain, people everywhere kill each other; for women, money, political, not necessarily in that order. Gentlemen, [glass dings] enough of wars, death, stabbings. I propose a toast to the lady who has brought light to our journey. To Bela Donna. Belladonna, a plant, both beautiful and dangerous. - [All] To Belladonna. [glasses clinking] [gentle romantic music] [waves splashing] - Why do you always behave so improperly? Lighting someone's cigar is much too intimate. - I decided to ignore that rule. - Yes, I noticed. - Did you forget where I'm from? You should have followed your family's advice and married one of your own kind. I'm not Donna O'Connor. - [Frank] You come from a fine family, you just don't know it yet. - Do you think that people are who they are? Or do you think life can change them? - If they want to change. - You talk to me, tell me you came to Brazil for me. - Oh, Brazil is wild, Donna, full of oil and opportunity. - You came for me. Somehow you thought this wild place would change me. Calm me down. - All right then, just for you. [gentle upbeat music] [people chattering] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [older man speaks Portuguese] [Tonho peaks Portuguese] [older man speaks Portuguese] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [people chattering] [woman shouts in Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [men exclaim excitedly in Portuguese] - Nô! [Nô laughs] [children shout] - [Man] Nô, hey! - Hey! - Hey! [people laughing] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [group speaks Portuguese] [older man speaks Portuguese] [woman speaking Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [man calls out in Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Nô sings merengue and claps] [men clap along] [woman laughs] [woman squeals] [older man speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [older man speaks Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [gentle poignant music] [wind whooshing] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Tonho exclaims] [Nô shouts] [both laughing] [Nô vocalizes] [Tonho shouts] [Nô laughs] [gentle pensive music] [waves crashing] [gentle romantic music] [Donna sighs] [body thuds] - Get my bag. - Right away, doctor. [waves crashing] - Bela Donna. Bela Donna. - What happened? - She'll be all right, Mr. Hookly. Just keep her out of the sun. [people chattering] [burro bellowing] - [Michael] Frank. - [Frank] Yes. - You survived the trip, huh? I'm Michael Silver, how do you do? - How do you do? - Welcome to Algiers. This is John, this is Lidia. - How do you do? - How do you do? - It's a pleasure, this is Donna. I'm afraid she's not feeling very well. - Oh, we'll have a doctor meet you at the house. A few hours on stable ground, you'll feel just fine. - Great. - After you please. - Thank you. - The ladies are going in the first car. You come with me and John in the yellow one. - All right. - Have a good trip? - [Frank] Yes, it's just fine. [people chattering] [car engines rumbling] - You know, Frank, there is oil out there. I can smell it. [engine rumbling] - Do you like it here? - Oh, Donna, let's save reality for later, shall we? [Donna sighs] [crickets chirping] - Obligato. [music box key clicking] [music box playing] [Donna sighs] [Donna moans] [birds chirping] [Donna sighing] [birds chirping] - Bom ja. [glass crashing] [maid gasps] Sorry. - I think Madam sleeping. - I was. - Careful. - Oh, thank you. - They told the name of your husband, but not your name. - Donna. - Donna? [maid chuckles] In here we call everyone Donna. Donna Maria, Donna Elaina. You are Donna what? - Donna Hookly. [maid speaks Portuguese] - Donna Hookly. My name is Benta. Benta. - Hi Benta. - Hi. - My name is Donna, just Donna. [Benta giggles] So, in here, the name of madame is Donna Donna. [both laughing] - Donna Donna. - Donna, excuse me. [dreamy music] [water splashing] [dreamy music continues] - Bom ja. [group of women speak Portuguese] [birds squawking] - You see these fisherman, they have almost no training. They're not used to machines and they hate working with them. [worker speaks Portuguese] If I brought in workers, I'd have to house them. This will be extremely expensive. You have a big job ahead of you. - But my job is finding oil. - It is. But once you found it, you have no one to drill it. - But you pay them a decent wage? - Yes, I do. I pay them very well, but they don't want to work. You see, when I got here, I offered them work on the days they couldn't fish. - What? - They didn't want it. No, they just want to lay around all day long talking nonsense. [horse snorts] I feel like a stupid trying to bring progress to a place that nobody wants any progress. Ha, and even worse. [Silva speaks in Portuguese] Excuse me. [Silva mutters in Portuguese] - Is this true? - I'm afraid so. But I can understand they are not wanting to feel, how should I put it? Penned in? [people chattering in Portuguese] Is your wife feeling better? - Mm, much. Yeah, she seems to love it here. - Then you'll come to dinner tonight. You've been here a week and Lidia is so anxious to get to know Donna. She positively wanted to invade your house the day after you arrived. I had to physically hold her back. Well, of course, you have the right to feel somewhere- - No, no, we'd love to come. - Oh, fantastic. - All right. [man groaning] [people chattering] My, my. - She's a beauty. Isn't she? - Oh yes, indeed. I've never actually brought myself around to riding one. [motorcycle rumbling] [chickens clucking] [engine rumbling] [Tonho shouts in Portuguese] [Frank questions in Portuguese] - He's not dead, doctor. Casa Cero have good luck. [Frank speaks Portuguese] - [Drunk] Who is it? [Tonho exclaims in Portuguese] [drunk shouts in Portuguese] [crowd laughs and talks] - You new engineer, okay? - Yeah, Frank Hookly. Yes. - I Tonho. - Prazer. - Prazer. - Ciao. - [Both] Ciao. - Business is as I expected it to be. [Donna sighs] - Hear the ocean? The way the waves break to the shore. Feel the air on your skin. - The fishermen don't want to work. I suspected something more, they look at us as if, they think we're imposters. - God, you always see the dark side, Frank. Change takes time. - [John] Lidia darling, they are here. - Good evening. - Hello. - Hello. My dear, you're looking lovely. - Thank you. - I'm so glad you could make it, do come in. - Thanks. [radio crackles] - When I saw you arriving you looked so pale and sick. I'm afraid I said to John, "That one's never going to make it." Then when I didn't hear from you I thought you must hate me. - I just didn't want to bother you. - Well it's a God forsaken place. I've done what I can to civilize it and make it bearable. I've shipped half of what I have here. Of course it took weeks and weeks to unpack it. And now that we're leaving in four months someone's going to have to pack it all up again. - The short wave radio has got to be the most important thing of the house. Do please install an antennae on the roof. That way, you'll get a much better reception. - I will, absolutely. - Your color's better. - I feel much better. I swim every day and the fruit, mm, so delicious. And fish cooked in coconut, I'm hooked. - I like a year with four seasons. Watching the colors from the leaves turn from green to brown, a cold wind. I like snow, and white Christmas's. And an excuse to wear a fur coat. [radio plays Portuguese music] Oh, and dancing, absolutely. - Yes, the savoy. - Nowadays we have our magazines and they arrive so late. - That voice. Just listen. - They sing, and they fish. And they fish and they sing. That's all they do. - Is it? [Portuguese music continues] [man sings in Portuguese] [Portuguese singing continues] - Would you care for something else, Donna Donna? - What? - You want eat something more? - Thank you. Benta, last night there was man singing on the beach, he had the most incredible voice. - I hear nothing. - A very good singer. Do you know who he is? - All the mens here sing. - This was different. - No. - What? - Maybe was he, Nô. - Nô? Is his name? Is he a fisherman. - Yes he fish. But he don't live here, he just come here, sometimes. Maybe he disappear already. Excuse me. - Nô. [man sings romantically in Portuguese] [whimsical romantic music] - You know what I found out at work today? That I may be involved in something highly illegal. There isn't any oil here at all. - What? - Seems my boss, Mr. Silvers, has been giving away these little bottles of oil hoping to attract investors. - So? - So the oil isn't from our field. He's trying to attract investors illegally. - I don't know why you're so surprised. You actually think successful businessmen are honest? - Darling you don't understand, I am legally responsible. I'm supposed to sign off on what they do. - Don't be so dramatic, Frank. - Did you really think you'd find ethics here? [Frank exhales loudly] [Donna sighs] I just hope you find oil. - Darling? You're angry with me, I know. You're disgusted with me, aren't you? - No. I just thought you knew what you were getting into. - I'm sorry. I can make this work, I know I can. [waves crashing] [Nô sings in Portuguese] [Nô sings faintly] [Nô continues singing] [water rushing] [workers shouting] [water rushing] - Water? - Where'd he get the idea there was oil here? - Seems he had a vision, a geological one at that. - A vision. - Point of view of science is bucking him up. [mystical flute music] [door creaks] [wings flutter] [bats squeaking] [Mae Ana shouts in Portuguese] [bats squeaking] [little girl speaks Portuguese] [wings flapping] [Mae Ana speaks in Portuguese] - Mae Ana. [bats squawking] [water splashing] [Mae Ana prays in Portuguese] [Mae Ana chants in Portuguese] [Mae Ana whispers in Portuguese] [waves lapping] [Donna grunts] [romantic music] - Bom gia. - Bom gia? - Sorry if I scare you, Miss. - Wow, these boats, rafts. [Donna chuckles] Almost seem as if they sail the waves by themselves. - You want to come on to my, my jangada? My boat? - Jangada. [Donna grunts] - Um, you swim here, every day? - Almost every day. [romantic dreamy music] - Well, I'm sure you'll find the reception will be much better than mine. [Frank chuckles] - Well you'll just have to come on over and have a listen. Next she'll be fishing. [shells rattle] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] [child speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] - Pardon, Mae Ana. [child speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] [crowd shouting faintly] [radio crackles] [radio plays romantic music] [romantic music continues] [waves crash] [seabirds call] [Donna giggles] [waves crashing] - Frank! Frank? I went out on a raft with a fisherman. - So I see. - I brought us lunch. Now you can't say you're only one who feeds us. [Hitler shouts in German on radio] [crowd on radio chants "Sieg heil"] [romantic Portuguese singing] [Hitler's speech continues faintly] [Donna sighs] [gentle music] [car engine rumbles] [mystical music] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] [Nô chuckles] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] - Bad lady! [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana speaks Portuguese] [Donna laughs] [upbeat fifties music plays] [Donna and Lidia laugh] [Lidia laughs] - Do you want a drink? - Some cashew juice, if you have some. - Absolutely not. And besides, you need something stronger. I hear you've been going out on one of the rafts. - How long have you been here? Have you ever wanted to out go out on one of the rafts? - No. And besides, from what I hear, that's not all you want to do. - Oh, from what you hear from who? - It's just talk around. [match sizzles] - Well, it's not what it seems. Nô isn't just handsome, he's, he's very delicate, gentle. - Nô? - That's his name. - Well, well. I see we're already quite intimate. I myself don't talk to fishermen. - I don't think he's just a fisherman. I think he's a wanderer. I won't be able to hold on to him for long. - You're mad to want to hold him at all. - And why? [Lidia and Donna laugh] [children shouting] [car horn bugles] [man in car shouts] [car horn squeaks] [man in car exclaims] [radio plays orchestral music] [man gives foreign speech on radio] - Why are you so restless? What's the matter? Are you that unhappy here? - The problem isn't here, Frank. It's there. That damn radio, you keep tuned to the war. Why do you cling to the destruction you left behind? - I don't think you mean that, Donna. - Of course I care about the war, Frank. But it's gonna go out whether we worry about it or not. - What's the matter? - Do you think we'd be here if wasn't for the war? Remember that magic word, Frank? Opportunity. It's those opportunities that brought us here. Or maybe you think we came for Mr. Silva's hospitality. So I could get my head on straight. [Donna sighs] [upbeat music plays on radio] [workers shout in Portuguese] - What is it, darling? - That, that dreadful little man has invaded Poland. We're at war. We're at war. - I thought we were in Brazil. - Doesn't it matter to you? - Hasn't it always been this way? - You can't be serious? There are millions of lives at stake. - Maybe you're right but, I realize that the reason we're here is because of the war. And if our husband's find oil in that God forsaken field, then our lives will be measurably better. Frank might finally find some peace, some contentment. And I would too. You think I'm shallow. Perhaps, but I choose only to let myself think about the things that I can change. Think whether you want it to all go away, so you can return to the Europe you left behind? Or perhaps deep down, you look forward to returning to a racially pure Europe. - Do you want to know why we're still here? John is Jewish. He can't go back. I don't think I will have that drink after all. Suddenly I'm not very thirsty. [footsteps faintly clicking] [crowd shouting and laughing] [people singing in Portuguese and shaking shakers] [singing continues] [gentle music] [waves crashing] [Donna sighing] [Donna gasping] [Donna gasping] [romantic music continues] [waves crashing] [seabirds calling] [rooster crows] [man yelling in Portuguese] [children giggling] [car door slams] - Bom gia. - Mama mia. [Frank speaks Portuguese] [John speaks Portuguese] [John speaks Portuguese] [Frank speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks Portuguese] - Tudo bem, obligato. [John speaks Portuguese] [car doors slam] [dreamy music] - Whoo! [water splashing] [dreamy music continues] [Nô calls out] [Nô laughs] [Donna laughs] [crowd shouts in Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [second man speaks Portuguese] [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [man chuckles] [man continues speaking in Portuguese] - How are you? - Fine. - You seem very far away. - No, I'm fine. Let me be for a moment the perfect wife. Can I get you drink, hon? - No thank you. - And how was your business. - It's all right. - And how are we? - I'm still here. - Yeah, part of you is here. - I was rude. I brought you these. They're almost like the ones we have back home. I had no right to speak to you that way. And I'm sorry. Now I'm hoping you'll offer me drink. - I was saying to John the other day, it's strange how a war we're so far away from, I mean geographically far away from, should affect us so acutely. It's as though it's under our skin. It's a kind of fear. A premonition that the world we know will no longer exist. [Lidia chuckles] You know, I think I need a drink more than you do. - How much of my money do you intend to lose here? - That's not a question I'm being paid to ask. - At this point it would be irresponsible of me not to ask it. - Sit down, Frank. I demand a little more respect from you. Your job is to drill. - If I thought that doing my job properly was all that was required- - Look, I have geological surveys that show there is oil to be found in this region. - I say they're not worth the paper they're written on. - If there is some reason to believe that oil exists here, then it is your job to find it. - Sounds more and more like you hired me to perform a miracle. Take it as you will. - Frank. If I were you, I'd also keep an eye on my wife. [motorcycle rumbles] [motorcycle sputters] - On and on and on, you're such a prick. - [Frank] Tonho. - Yes, I am. [Frank speaks Portuguese] - Work? Here no. [Tonho speaks Portuguese] - In the Calle de Machine, money more, no. [Frank speaks Portuguese] - Yes, but- [Tonho speaks Portuguese] I want this very much. I'm go to Sao Paolo. [motorcycle rumbles] [Tonho exclaims in Portuguese] [Frank laughs] [Tonho exclaims in Portuguese] [Frank questions in Portuguese] - [Tonho] Like! I like! I am from this beach. Um, but this beach have, no have, no have money. No have woman. - Don't have woman? - Woman good, Doctor. Woman free. Only not here is woman. [Tonho rants in Portuguese] You not look Nô? - Nô? - Nô. [Tonho rants in Portuguese] Bad man! [Frank questions in Portuguese] Yes! But I'm a go to the mount, little issue. [Tonho speaks Portuguese] Hey Doctor, drink cachaça? - Cachaça, no. - [Tonho] Never? - No. - Let's go to mi casa. [Tonho exclaims in Portuguese] - Si? - [Tonho] Yes! - Ah, soon. [Tonho exclaims in Portuguese] - Okay. [Donna giggles] - [Nô] Come on. [Nô laughs] - Hey! [Nô laughs] [water splashing] [Donna shouts] [dreamy romantic music] [dice rattle] [Frank scoffs] - A little luck, luck. Luck [Frank speaks Portuguese] - Yeah, esa? Claro que no. [Frank speaks Portuguese] - Bad people, hm? [Tonho speaks Portuguese] - [Frank] What? - But, for the man of position, of names- [Tonho speaks Portuguese] [gentle tense music] [Tonho continues speaking Portuguese] [Frank speaks Portuguese] [engine cuts] - Hello there. - Hello. I've been waiting up for you. - Well, here I am. What have you been doing? - Lidia. - Ah. - She gets me with those old records of hers. - When did you start making friends with women? - Lidia's my friend. Or have I really ever had a friend. - I'm your friend. - You know I actually think you'd like to be. Why'd you marry me, Frank? - Because I loved you. - It's not you, you know. It's me. It's just that sometimes your love is suffocating. It just feels as though I can't breath. - I don't do it on purpose. - It's not your fault. [Donna sighs] I'm not always easy to be with either. I'll try to be better. It's just that sometimes I think it's only the bad parts of me that you love. [pages rustle] [dreamy romantic music] [Donna sighs] [dreamy romantic music continues] [gentle tense music] [worker grunts] [valve squeaks] - Vai Pedro. [wrench squeals] [valves rumble] [men all cheer] [oil splashing] [gentle triumphant music] - Whoo! [men cheering] - A dream? - Okay. [Nô chuckles] - That we can go out from here. [Nô exclaims in Portuguese] [Nô laughs] [Nô exclaims in Portuguese] Miami, and you will stay, aqui. [Nô speaks in Portuguese] A new life. [gentle romantic music] Aah. It's a dream. [Donna speaks Portuguese] - Tell me, tell me everything. - Tell you what? [Lidia exhales sharply] What is it? What's he like? Well, what's it like to lie in the sand together? To be in his raft? - It's like nothing ever I've ever known before. But something I always knew existed. - I think I shall try some of this cashew juice. Mm. [Lidia and Donna laugh] I guess it's good for somethings. [Donna chuckles] And when you get caught? - It won't matter. - Won't it? 'Cause you will get caught. You're right on the edge of it. There's talk. - Talk. That's the one thing this place has in common with back home. Isn't that right, Benta? - Here, as in many other parts of the world, people stick there nose in other peoples business. - Well it doesn't bother me. - Well it should. - It bothers me. You're my wife, your behavior affects me and the way I'm perceived affects the company. - And have I done that affects the company, Frank? - There's talk about you and that half breed. - He's not a half breed. And I am not your property. - This is a very small world we live in, Donna. We're not the only ones here. - And what kind of world is it, if the only thing people care about is small town gossip? - You're being very naive, darling. Do as I tell you. Give me your word you won't speak with him again. - I don't know if I can do that. [Donna sighs angrily] Say something. Say something. Yell at me, insult me, just don't sit there staring at me like an idiot. - I had no idea until just this minute how little you respected me. - You know it's not that. - I don't know anything, apparently. Donna, I thought that if I took care of you, you, you would, take care of me. Silva, John and Lidia are going into Fortaleza for the weekend. We'll go with them. - Ah! - Don't say anything. We're going home now.

[romantic singing continues] [romantic music continues] [Governor speaks Portuguese] [romantic singing continues] - So it's all right for me to carry on if there's something in it for you? - For both of us darling. - When did you become so cynical? What you're saying is my behavior with the Governor just now, wasn't inappropriate? I didn't even light his excellency ac cigar. [Frank groans] [bird squawks] [gentle tense music] [Benta yells] - Nô! [Nô groans] [Benta sobs] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Nô responds weakly in Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Nô speaks weakly in Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Benta speaks Portuguese] [hooves clopping] [people talking] [car engine purrs] [father calls out] [little girl giggles] - Gentlemen. [Governor speaks Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] [Governor speaks Portuguese] [man speaks Portuguese] We like to make people feel welcome here and give them something to take home. Please accept this small souvenir for your wife. [Donna sighs] - What's this, a peace offering? - A token from the Governor. - I think it looks quite good on me. If you speak to the Governor before I do, be sure and thank him for me. I'm going to pack. Benta. We have four for dinner tonight. Do we have enough food? - Because of you. - I don't understand. - He almost died. Now, you can leave him in peace. - Benta, what are you talking about? - Nô, your husband tried to kill him. [gentle poignant music] - [Mae Ana] Assesinos! Assesinos! [Mae Ana yells in Portuguese] [Silva speaks Portuguese] [Mae Ana shouts in Portuguese] [Silva speaks Portuguese] - Mae Ana, por favor! [Mae Ana rants in Portuguese] [gentle dramatic music] [foreman shouts in Portuguese] [poignant music] [Nô speaks Portuguese] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [Nô responds in Portuguese] [Ana Mae shouts in Portuguese] [Nô pleads in Portuguese] [Ana Mae questions in Portuguese] [Nô responds in Portuguese] [Ana Mae shouts in Portuguese] - So you don't know who it was? A fisherman's quarrel, don't make me laugh Frank. That man wasn't from around here. - Donna, you don't know what you're talking about. These people are savages, they kill each other over nothing. - And I thought you did it out of love. [Donna gasps] [Nô gasps] - How dare you? I should of left you in the gutter where I found you. [Donna breathes heavily] [gentle romantic music] - No. [lock clicks] [door thuds] [glass shatters] [Frank vocalizes] [Donna gasps] [Frank grunting] [gentle melancholy music] Nô. [Nô groans] [Donna speaks Portuguese] Wake up. [Nô groans] - What are you doing here? My mother said that I was going to see your true face. - Are you as crazy as she is? - I'm crazy? I'm crazy? - Frank beat me. - I know. - He beat me because of you. - I know. I heard all. I was outside of your window. - Spying. - Not spying! Not spying! I'm not spying! I'm looking for you. And you know that. And what I found. - Have you ever- Have you ever been beaten within an inch of your life? [Nô shouts in Portuguese] You do what you have to, to survive. - You are lying! Lie, if you need, but I don't make part of this. - Tomorrow, my face will be the same way it was before and you'll regret what you just said to me. - Really, Donna? You think, you didn't change, a little. This, this is your face. [gentle dreamy music] - I'm sorry that couldn't love you enough. [music box plays] [wind blows] [rattles shaking] [mystical music] [Ana Mae speaks Portuguese] [wind blows] - Take care of Frank for me. - Can I really take care of him? - Yes, you can.
