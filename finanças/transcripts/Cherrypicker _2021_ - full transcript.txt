Don't stop. Do it. Do it. [hits] [Sean grunts] [heavy breathing] [grunting] [dramatic music] [sighs] Oh god. Watch, watch this. Oh, we are so hot together. I can't believe that's me. Come away with me this summer. Look, Sean, I can't. The girls. Bring them. We'll all go to the cottage. They'll love it. No, it's way too soon for them. No it's not. We'll be like a family. No. Yes. No. [Sean] Yes. No. - Yes. - No. [Louis laughs] [Louis] Propose? As in marriage? As your attorney, let me remind you- - Go on. She's got four kids. [laughs] Have you lost your mind? That reminds me. Can you watch Richard this summer? He gets weird around the girls. [tense music] [birds chirping] [soft piano music] [squeals] - Ew. - I got an idea. Come on. [soft piano music] Throw it in the sewer. Don't. - Do it. - Don't, you don't have to. Do it. [soft piano music] [tense, mysterious music] Well, it's dead now. - I miss daddy. - Me, too. Well shut up about it. [car honks] [Girls] Mommy! [Dahlia] Mommy. She's been on this job two weeks, she's bouncing off the boards. She's drunk. She's drunk. The tracks are all over the ice. There's a cop in the stands, his son's playing hockey that night, he goes out on the ice, he arrests her. I gotta finish cleaning the ice. [laughing] So tell us, how did you two meet? Um... Why don't you tell it? Well, after I got injured, right, I was going to physio and it was pretty dark for me at that time, as you guys know. Keep your head up. Keep your head up! Ah. [soft music] Hey. Thank you. [soft music] I lose everything. No, no, look. [Laura sobbing] Look, I got it. Is everything all right here? We're good, bud. - It doesn't look like it. - It's fine. I'd just rather hear it from her. Hey, are you okay? - It's all right- - Beat it, champ. Hey, you're Sean Chase. Oh my god, dude, can I get a photo with you? It's amazing. This guy's a legend right here. Hold on, let me just take a quick one. - Yo it's- - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, go get her, Chase! You got this! A widow with four kids. That's a hell of a scrap you're getting into. I can keep my feet. You don't know what you're talking about. Oh yeah? Got any recommendations, old fella? [soft music] [Mr. Chase] Don't go in empty handed. Oh. [Mr. Chase] It was your grandmother's. Why didn't he give this to mom? [Mr. Chase chuckles] I tried, twice, but you know your mother. She never gave a damn about rings or trinkets, but she'd kill for her family. So tell me about your children. I have four girls. Oh, how wonderful. Sean is my only son. [chuckles] I don't think I could love anyone as much as him. Sean is a warrior and loyal... And needs someone to protect. He gets that from me. Just make sure you protect him, too. I will. Good. Or else. [cork pops] [Laura exclaims] [laughing] - [Laura chuckles] - Hey. - Hey pretty lady. - Hey tough guy. You all set? Getting there, yeah. Okay. The girls are gonna love this. [Laura]] They're... They're coming around. - [laughing] - Okay. Whoa. Hey. What's shakin', kids? - These your bags? - Yeah, yeah. Why don't you grab the bags? - [chuckles] - Okay, that's right. There we go, what's a man for, huh? Uh huh. [laughs] So? Where are we going again? We talked about this. Is Sean going to be there the whole time? Stop it. [Violet] Can't we stay at our house? Our house doesn't have swimming. A pool? - Not- - A lake. Even better. Say hi, girls. Hi Sean. - [Sean chuckles] - Wow. Hey there little ladies. Can't wait to see your faces when we get there. You're going to love it. Huh? Right, munchkin? Come here. [Dahlia whines] [Dahlia] My, my... Oh here. Here. Here, I got it. - There you go, no problem. - Okay. - Got it? - Yeah.

Right. License and registration. Oh yeah. I've got it right here, officer. [birds chirping] That's expired, jackass. Well I just got it renewed. Typical bullshit. - Brian. - Good to see ya.

They're going to have a blast. [birds chirping] All right. Let's pile out. [Dahlia] My legs are asleep. Oh, your legs are sleepy, are they? Let's wake 'em up. [birds chirping] - Hi. - Hi, baby. Hi. It's beautiful here. Girls, grab your backpacks. Hi, did you have fun? Look how beautiful it is here. My grandpa built the cottage, and when I was 19, my dad was going to sell it. The next year, I turned pro, I bought it. [Dahlia] Froggy! Her frog. [Sean] Oh. [Laura grunts] Get a load of this. Is that for swimming? [Sean] You bet it is. Looks scary. It'll clear up. I just have to show your mom something. We'll be right back girls, okay? [Rosalee] Where are you taking her? Oh, it's um, a surprise. I love surprises.

That's a nice one. It's got eggs, you see that? [Lily] Ew. Kill it. - Kill it. - Yeah, kill it. [Girls] Kill it, kill it, kill it. We're not killing the spider. We could've just killed it. Well, mommy knows best, right? [birds chirping] Okay, watch this. Be free, big mama. My hero. Well that was exciting. What's next? Maybe a little swimming? Huh? - Huh? - Sounds like fun. Let's get our suits on. - Come on. - Sean! Anthony! Hey! [Anthony laughs] - Oh, welcome back! - How are ya? Oh. How are you? Good, man. Ah, I saw you break your neck. Fuckin' crazy, man. Yeah, well, at least my head's still attached, right? Uh huh. [laughing] Is that Matia? Hey, T. Hey Sean. [soft music] Caprice. Oh, this is Laura and the girls. Hi Laura and the girls.

[splashing] - Ha ha. - Rosie pushed me. [Rosalee] No I didn't. Rosalee's lying. Lily. Don't be a tattletale. Rosalee, don't push. You don't feel like swimming Lily? [Lily] No. Okay. [Lily laughs] This one was easier. [laughs] Okay, sit down. Here, let me... How did those get there? [birds chirping] - And this one, too. - Oh. I don't know how they got there. Those are bruises, mommy. [Lily sneezes] Bless you. They're all over your arm, too. See? Are you girls all done swimming? [Girls] Yeah. All right, perfect. Let's go on up, huh? [soft music] Mom's lying, you know. I know. [insects buzzing] [birds chirping] Hey, what's going on over there? Little powwow? You hungry, baby? I got some chicken. Lots of chicken. Gross. [Sean mimics chicken] [tense jazzy music] It cuts chicken meat real easy. Hey. Careful with that. [knife thuds] You don't have to be mean about it. Why don't you guys go outside and play, huh? Yeah. Good idea. [Rosalee grunts] That's what mommies and daddies do. Sean's not our daddy. What is he, then? Faker, that's what. Faker. A faker. [soft music] [tense, mysterious music] [Lily] I was just gonna play that. [Violet] Well too bad, I played it first. [soft, mysterious music] [insects buzzing] [birds chirping] [kisses] - I hate to be without you. - Mm. I'm really glad we came. Me, too. [soft, mysterious music] Good. Let's go. [soft, mysterious music] You stay here, and look out. [soft, mysterious music] Don't touch that. Be careful. [soft, mysterious music] This is Sean's. What the? What is this? Rope? - Handcuffs. - Wait. Where'd he get handcuffs? Did he break the law? [gasps] What else is in this bag? [gasps] Tape. [soft, mysterious music] What is... [soft, mysterious music] [uneven breathing] All right. If Sean puts this on mommy's finger, he'll be our daddy forever. But only if mommy says yes. She will. Sean will make her, 'cause she's scared. Scared of what? We need to find out. Put all this stuff back. Let's go. Come on. Go. [birds chirping] [insects buzzing] [television blaring] Violet? Yeah? You ready? [soft, mysterious music] - Hi, mom. - Hi. [Sean chuckles] Hey Violet, I bet you don't know how to whistle. [whistles] Hey Sean, what's your old hockey number? [Sean] What's that- [glass thuds] [splashing] Oh. When did that get there? Rosalee, did you put that there? Don't worry, mom, I'll get it. Are you up to something? [Rosalee] No. [Sean] Lily, you asked me something? I forget now. [tense, mysterious music] Okay. [tense, mysterious music] [insects buzzing] [animals vocalizing] - Hi. - Hi. The girls are finally... Asleep. - Oh god. - I know. [soft, mysterious music] I do. It's his old hockey number. Okay. Come on. 212. Right. [tense, dramatic music] Do you hear something? Mm, no. [dramatic music] [Laura] Do it. [moaning] [dramatic music] [heavy breathing] Stop, stop. I can't. Stop. I can't. I can't. Oh, I can't. - Oh good god. - I can't. [moaning] [heavy breathing] - [Sean sighs] - Girls, do I hear something? 'Cause I think I did. You know the rules. Now get some sleep. Hey mom? Yes, honey? Are you okay? Yes, of course, why/ We get worried about you. [Violet] Yeah, like you're in trouble. [Laura chuckles] Girls. You don't have to worry. I'm real good, okay? Mwah, mwah. Mwah, mwah. Good night. Sweet dreams. [soft music] [insects buzzing] [Lily] Spider eggs? [Rosalee] Yes. [soft, mysterious music] [Sean clears throat] [grunts] [birds chirping] [soft music] [Laura] Hey honey? [Laura whistles] I'm going into town, I'll be back soon, okay? Okay, baby. - Mwah, love you. - Love you. [soft, mysterious music] [splashing] [birds chirping] [soft, mysterious music] [ship horn blares] [Dahlia humming] Mommy? Yes, honey? Is Sean mean to you? No, Sean's very nice to mommy. He smells funny. Yeah. Sometimes. But guess what? All boys do. Perfect. Can you girls get some green apples, too? Those are Sean's favorite. - Uh-huh. - Okay. [Laura] Thank you. [soft, mysterious music] One. Two. Three. Wait, wait. Give that to me. [Violet] What's the pin for? A surprise. [soft, mysterious music] Let's go. [Matia] Hey, Sean. Yo, T, what's up? [Matia] Nothing. Bored. Can I hang? Yeah, of course. That's what the dock is for. All right, bring her in you show off. - Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Yeah, kid. All right, I gotcha. Thank you. Let me tie you up here. How's your summer going, kid? [Matia] Pretty good. [Sean] Ah, yeah. What happened to your arm? Sauna burn. - [Matia laughs] - Oh. [Sean sighs] [soft music] Geez. Rockin' a bit of jail bait this summer, aye, kiddo? What's that? Means you're starting to look like a woman, but you're not. Whatever. [soft, strange music] Boys will start giving you a lot of attention. They'll want something in return. If you say so. Don't play dumb with me, kid. You know what I'm talking about. Can I have a beer? [Sean] No. My dad lets me. [Sean] You can have a Radler. [soft, strange music] [birds chirping] [Matia chuckles] [Matia] My dad says your new girlfriend has a lot of kids. Yeah. She's a great mom. Are they having fun? I think so. It's kind of hard to tell. Yeah. Girls are weird. [Sean] You said it, bud. Do you wanna take a selfie with me? [Sean] Sure. Okay. - Are you ready? - Always. [Sean grunts] [laughing] [Sean grumbling] Okay. I'll send them to you. [Sean] Oh. Cool. Whoa! Call the fire department. I want mine crisp to a burn. [laughing] Your Laura. She's a freak in the bedroom. [laughing] Ah, before I met Caprice, I slept with hundreds of women. Some more beautiful, some less so, but I loved them all. But to love a woman with everything to make a family, that's crazy. But that's the most beautiful thing. Thanks for saying that, man. My friends think of nuts. Aye, you are. [laughs] But that's the fate of men like us. To raise daughters and put our lives forever in the service for women that we love. You got it? Yeah. Good boy. [Sean chuckles] [soft music] [Dahlia] Hey! [girls chattering] [tense, strange music] - It's far. - That's 'cause it's a secret beach. If it's a secret beach, then why does it have a road? Sean lies to us, that's why. Almost there! Liar. [girls shouting] [waves crashing] [girls shouting] This one is barcelite. Oh. [soft, mysterious music] [girls shouting] [Sean laughs] There's no reception here. My book works just fine. See it? [Matia scoffs] I'm gonna take a dip. [Laura] Okay. [soft, tense music] [Sean] Hey munchkin. [laughs] [Sean screeching] [tense music] [Dahlia] Hey! - Hey Laura. - Oh hey Matia. [Matia] Can I sit with you? Of course. Rosalee. Rosalee. Don't start. [sighs] This is a real beautiful beach. Yeah. I've been here lots before. Have you known Sean long? Oh yeah. I've known him since I was little. - He watched me grow up. - Oh. Like a big brother. - No, we're just friends. - Oh. It's different this year, though. - He usually has parties. - Oh. - Yeah. - And you liked that better? Oh yeah, I would sneak over. [Laura laughs] Does Sean know this? Yeah. He would watch out for me and take care of me. [Laura] That's what he does for me, too. Hm. Do you think it's the same? It's... - It's different~. - Mm. [girls shouting] Do you mind paying some suntan lotion on my back for me, please? - Sure. - Thank you. You're welcome. [tense music] Hey, T, throw me that towel, would ya? [tense music] - All done. - Thank you. You're welcome. [tense music] Hey T, that reminds me. You busy Friday? [Matia] Um, I don't think so, why? [Sean] Wanna babysit for a few hours? Sean.

We'll be back after you're in bed and I want you girls to be fast asleep, okay? No funny business. - Yes, mommy. - Mm-hm. [Girls] Yes, mommy. All right, team effort. You got to love that. [soft, tense music] Oh, why thank you. [soft, tense music] Wait. Don't go. Dahlia, honey, what is it? I'm scared. Don't go. Aww. You have nothing to be scared of. We're just going into town.

Well I sure I am. Want an apple? Mm. No thanks. [tense, mysterious music] [Laura laughs] It's your favorite. [Rosalee] Only when mommy makes it. [Matia] She did make it. But you touched it. With a spoon. We don't need a babysitter. Okay. Let's just be friends then. But don't have any friends. Yes I do. Then where are they? Not in Tobermory. Where are your sisters? I don't have any. Is Sean your brother? No, he's just my friend. Is he your boyfriend? No, he's just my friend. You're lying. No I'm not. If we're friends, then let's play a game. [Matia] Okay. A trust game. What's that? [Violet] Here, I'll show you. Lily, I'll do you, okay? [Lily] Okay. [Violet] I'm ready. I'm ready. [Violet] See, it's fun. [Dahlia] Do me, do me. [Matia] Whoa, good one. Your turn. Oh, I don't think so. I'm way too heavy. Come on, it'll be fine. We'll all catch you, right? - Yep. - Come on. I really don't think this is a good idea. Listen. It's called the trust game for a reason. You have to trust us. Go on, trust us. [girls shout] [Matia] Okay, okay. Are you sure you can catch me? - No looking. - Okay, I'm not too heavy? - Yes. - You're not going to drop me? - Let's try it. - Come on. - We're not gonna drop you. - I think I... - Nope. - Yup.

[laughs] What makes you think I'm gonna let you get away that easily? [Sean chuckles] Huh? [Sean] I love you. [Sean sighs] [tense music] [Lily] This is bad. She's hurt. Not for long. Violet. - Sit on her. - Okay. [Rosalee] Get her legs, quick, quick. [Dahlia] Me too. [Violet] Okay. - Get her feet. - Me too, me too. [tense, strange music] [Violet] She's waking up.

[muffled yelling] [Violet] Yes. [Rosalee] Violet, let's drag her. [Matia breathing heavily] [Laura chuckles] Ah. [Laura chuckles] Oh wow. [soft music] [water splashing] Do you think the girls are all right? [Rosalee] Hurry up. [Violet] I'm going, I'm going. [Rosalee] Move. Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're fine. [water splashing] You see that? See what? See that, right over there. What? You're telling me you don't see that right there? Sean, what is it? Our future. [soft music] Sean. [chuckles] Sean, I can't believe you. What the fuck? Where's the ring? Oh, stop it. No, I'm serious. - I can't fucking find it- - Look, I don't know if you're joking or not, but you got me, okay, but wow. This is the fucking worst, I lose the ring? [Sean mumbling] Sean, no, wait, Sean, no. No. [soft, romantic music] You just asked me to marry you. I guess I did. [soft, romantic music] Of course yes. [chuckles] Yes. [Rosalee] Sean hurts mommy, make him stop. [Matia] What are you talking about? [Rosalee] You know. No, I don't. Untie me right now. You girls are in so much trouble. No, you're in trouble. Get that knife out of my face. Sean hurts your mom? I don't know anything about that. She's lying. He's your friend. Tell us. I'm not lying. I'll scream. I'll scream and everybody will hear it. No you won't. You're not on our side. You're on Sean's side! I'll cut you like a chicken. [tense, dramatic music] [Matia screams] Be quiet! [splashing] - Why did you do that? - I didn't mean it. This is bad. [Sean and Laura chuckling] [insects buzzing] I just gotta get my keys. [Laura giggles] [moaning] [tense, strange music] Everything okay? Where's Matia? [Sean] I don't know. Asleep? Where? [tense music] Hm. [tense music] [Girls] Hey mommy. [Laura] You're awake. Where's Matia? She's gone. I can see that. [soft, tense music] Matia's gone. Oh, okay. Oh okay? And that's babysitting? Well it's late. She probably, you know, went home. She left the girls all alone. What the hell, Sean? You said I could trust, you know, she's doing this on purpose to try to get to me. I see the way she... Who are you calling? - Who do you think? - I don't know. That's why I'm asking. [Laura sighs] [phone buzzes] It's Matia's phone. I'm going to pop over there. Check up on her. Don't worry. Everything's fine, okay? I love you very much. Okay? Don't be like that. [insects buzzing] Hello? Anyone home? [soft, mysterious music] Matia? I've got your phone. [mysterious synth music] Matia? [hits] Ow! Shit. [hits] Ow! Fuck! [tense synth music] Great. [yelling] [crowd cheering] [hitting] [grunting] [tense, mysterious music] [soft, mysterious music] [faint cheering] - Is that? - Is that Sean? [soft, mysterious music] Why are you, why are you here? Anything wrong? I'm just looking for Matia. She wasn't there when we got back. Oh, so she's here then? No. Oh, okay. Well I'm going to call her. Eh, don't bother. Her phone's on the table inside. Inside? Well how? She forgot it at my place. - Your door was open so I- - Why are you bleeding? Oh, yeah. I cracked my head off that doorframe. [Caprice] Anthony. I'm worried. And the girls were, home? Yeah, they said T just left. That's odd. But I'm sure there is an explanation. I guess. Teenagers, you know? So it seems. Nothing to worry about, all right? I'm sure everything's fine. Call me when she turns up. Have a good night. - Good night. - Anthony? [Employee] Is everything okay? Sensing a bad vibe. Have you seen Matia? No. Why? Well she was babysitting at my place last night. Takes off early. No, one's seen her. Weird. Yeah. Right? Huh. - Can I ask you something? - Mm-hm. Is there anything going on between you two? No, I think she likes you. Look, her parents are worried. Call me if you see her. Yeah, sure. No problem. All right. See ya. She's only 14. I feel like I'm losing my mind. She's gonna be okay. We just have to wait. [soft, mysterious music] [Violet] They're talking about Matia. You have such lovely children. [birds chirping] Get your feet off me. [Dahlia grunting] - Hey. - Hey. No sign of her. [Caprice] What? Anthony back? - No. - Not yet. He'll have good news, okay? - He always does. - That's right, he will. He'll find her. She was always sneaking over here. I knew this wouldn't end well. [soft, mysterious music] Where's the ring? [soft, mysterious music] [rustling] Where the fuck is it? [soft, mysterious music] [rustling] [Rosalee grunts] Get that away from me. [soft, mysterious music] [Sean grunts] [choking] [grunting] [Laura] Sean? What? What is wrong? Sean. Oh my god. [Sean yells indistinctly] [yells] [spits] Fuckin' pins? What kind of fucking psycho puts a pin in an apple? That could've been one of the girls, but luckily it was me. Yeah, well... [spiting] [water running] [Laura] Let me see, let me see. [Anthony] What's going on? He ate the bad apple. What? - What's going on here? - Oh, did you find her? - No. - Oh, baby. [Caprice sobbing] [Anthony] Sean. I'm fine. Listen, I, I talked to the police. They are gonna ask some questions. - Is that okay? - Of course, anything to help. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Laura. Let's go home. No. - Yes. - No, no, no. - Sean will do what he can. - No, no, I'm gonna stay. - Let's go home. - No, I don't wanna go. Let's go home. Let's go home, then. Come on, let's go. [Caprice sobs] Hey girls, why don't you take these and just go wait for mommy? - Okay. - As soon as I'm done, - I'll come and get you. - Okay. Okay. - Let me see. - No, it's fine. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. [soft, mysterious music] See? Sean's not so tough. [soft, mysterious music] [birds chirping] Why are the police here? [Lily sighs] They're looking for Matia. Yeah. Zip it. [Dahlia] Yeah. Zip it. [soft, mysterious music] There was no sign of struggle? Nothing out of place? No, nothing. Everything is as it should be. And that's normal? My kids have no reason to lie to me. Kids don't always know the difference, yes? Excuse me. Mine do. They're good kids, Brian. [cell phone buzzing] Excuse me. My boss is calling. [phone line trilling] [soft, mysterious music] [Detective Morton] Jesus. [Brian] Yes, chief? Yeah, I'm looking at the girl's cell phone photos. It ain't pretty. Hey, don't worry. She's gonna turn up. I know Matia will turn up. Reel him in, we'll find here. [Brian] Yes, sir. [Detective Morton] Disgusting. Can you give us a second? Why? I'd like to speak to Sean privately, please. What for? Hey. All right, it's fine. Come on, babe, just a couple of minutes. [Laura sighs] It's okay. Really. [birds chirping] What's going on? A young girl is missing, Sean. Yeah, I know. Is there anything else that might explain her disappearance? I don't know. You're the cop. And your friend, Sean. Let's start off of what we do know. She likes to hang around here. I've seen her myself on occasion. Oh yeah, she's Anthony's kid, I mean, I've known her for years. Matia's phone was submitted as evidence. Okay, good. We're on the verge of a criminal investigation now. - What are you talking about? - Take this seriously. I am taking this seriously. [water splashing] [birds chirping] [tense, dramatic music] [screaming] [Laura] Oh my god! He's looking at us. [Violet] Is mommy okay? She looks sad. - [gasps] - Remember the rules. Hello there. Sad about Matia, isn't it? Maybe you could tell me. She didn't fall down there herself. Did she? We don't know anything. Stop asking questions. Did someone tell you to say that? Did Sean tell you to say that? [Laura] What the hell is going on here? I'm just having a conversation with the girls. This is all for Matia. Yeah well not without my permission. May I continue? Okay, girls... [clears throat] Answer Officer Brian's questions, okay? - Yes, mommy. - Yes, mommy. Yeah. What happened to Matia? And I'll start with you. Uh... It's okay. You can tell me. Um, last time I saw Matia was... When we cleaned up right before bed. Yes. She put us the bed and shut the door. Was there any noises at all? Only Sean. Sean? Yes, Sean. When we came home together. [tense, mysterious music] I see. [tense, mysterious music] [knocks] Anthony. [tense, mysterious music] Sean. I'm so sorry. [Caprice] I don't want him in my house! It's not a good time. [tense, dramatic music] You understand? [knocking] [Officer] Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me. What is this? We're here to search the premises. I knew you were an asshole, Brian. [tense, mysterious music] - What's this? - They have a warrant. Sorry, Sean. Just following orders. Orders? [Officer] Is this yours? Yes. Hmm. - Whoa. - Nothing personal. [Laura] Whoa, what the hell are you doing? You have the right to remain silent. - What the fuck, man? - Anything you say- - Let go of me! [Laura] Sean! [Brian] Don't make me- [Brian yelling indistinctly] [Sean] You piece of shit! [tense, dramatic music] [Officer] Is there anything in the room? No? Did you check there? Absolutely nothing. Can you believe this guy led the league in penalty minutes three years in a row? - [female officer scoffs] - What a jackass. [tense synth music] Can I see it? Ooh, sparkles. Is that way the police are here? No, it's 'cause of Matia. They think Sean did it. - But we did it. - That's a secret. [Rosalee] Give it to me. But Sean didn't do it. He did other things. You know. She's right. That's a secret. Do you want the police to take us away forever? [Laura moaning] [Laura] Oh, I can't. [moaning] I can't. I can't. Oh. Yeah? Hi sir. I have something I need to show you. These are the cell phone and autopsy photos. [Detective Morton] Jesus Christ. How'd you crack the password? It was his hockey number. - Twice. - Hm. Not smart. [Officer] No, sir. Sick fuck. [tense, mysterious music] [Sean] Ah. [tense, mysterious music] Something wrong with your ear? Got some water in it. [tense, mysterious music] I'm going to ask you a couple of questions. Okay. You ever been convicted of a crime? Charged, not convicted. [Detective Morton] What for? Fight on the ice. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember hearing about that one. Well the charges were dropped. Still, it was quite a fight. I don't think the other guy, uh, saw you coming. Is that a joke? What, you get mad easily? Violence is part of the game. And you like to play games, don't you? Excuse me? How long have you been with your girlfriend? Fiancee. - Eight months. - Do you hit her? It's a simple question. No, it's not. You do know why you're here, don't you? - Matia Gaddis was murdered. - Murdered? Terrible, isn't it? Yeah, it is terrible. [Detective Morton] What's your relationship with Matia? I've known her since she was a kid. We were friends. Seems like all kinds of friends. What'd you do with the black tape? Tape? The sex tape you bound her with. [tense, dramatic music] [Sean gasps] [Sean yells] Spiders. I hate spiders! [Sean yelling] Sean, what's going on here? - I don't know. - Jesus Christ. This is my client. Sean Chase is a national treasure and a proud member of the indigenous community- - This man has been arrested for killing a teenage girl. I am not letting this sick fuck out of my sight. This man is innocent! [taser buzzes] [Louis yells] [tense, dramatic music] Well, that's the last of them. How does something like that even happen? Spiders are everywhere they say. [Lawyer] Laura called me. I came right away. [sighs] Hey buddy. Hey, hey. Goddamn, that was exhilarating. I can't believe they fuckin' tased me. I feel so fuckin' jacked right now. They said Matia was murdered. As in killed on purpose. I know. They're going to try to pin this on you. We need to D-up. If anything happens, you call me right away. Yeah. Hey, thank you, aye? Let's get you home. [car starts up] Do you miss daddy? Sometimes, yeah. You know what? Every time I look into your eyes, I can... Oh my god, Sean? What happened to your ear? - Oh. - Honey. [Dahlia] Sean's back! [Rosalee] What? The girls doing okay? Yeah. [Lily] This is your fault. No it's not. And you made her fall. Only 'cause Lily told me too. It was her fault. - That's not true. - Yeah it is. Sean hurts mommy and you let him. You, too. - I love mommy the most. - Shut up, dummy. - Faker. - No I'm not. I'm not dumb. [girls grunt] [Dahlia] Fight, fight, fight. [insects buzzing] [birds chirping] [tense, mysterious music] Ow. A tooth? [tense, mysterious music] - Where are you? - Right here. [Laura sighs] The police called. They want me to go in and make a statement. What's the matter? This. The cop said it was used on Matia. I know. She was bound in it. - I have to tell the police. - No, don't. You want me to lie? No. Um... I need to talk to Louis. You have your phone? [cell phone buzzing] [toilet flushing] [Louis grunts] [Richard panting] What a day. [Richard groans] [Laura] I have to go. They're expecting me and... Just tell them that Matia was gone when we got back, that's all you have to say. Did you hear something? [Laura] Girls? You don't think they had anything to do with this? Sean. No. No. Because I don't know who else would've. If they were involved, I would know. Of course you'd know. You're a good mom. [tense music] I'm going to figure this out. I told you. Sean's going to tell on us. What should we do? It's us against him. But he's so big. We'll cut his legs off. That's a bad plan. Well, what's your plan? [Lily sighs] [tense, mysterious music] It's us or him. [tense, mysterious music] The ring... The tape... Matia. He's in the oven again. That's where he gets stronger. How do we get him out? [tense, mysterious music] We'll smoke him out. [tense, mysterious music] Smoke? Hi, Sean! [Sean yells] Geez! What is going on back there? [tense music] These kids, man, I swear. [tense music] Oh come on. Oh! Geez. Come on. [Sean grunts] [slicing] What the fuck? You? You cut me? You cut me you little freak. Oh! [panting] [phone ringing] [tense, dramatic music] Louis. [grunting] [tense, dramatic music] Lily! Help me! Answer the phone! [tense, dramatic music] Your sister... She cut me. Lily. Back, Rosalee. Back! What is this? What are you doing? You're not one of us. Let me through. No, Sean. [phone ringing] [tense, dramatic music] - [spraying] - Back. [girls scream] [Sean grunting] [Violet] Run. Let me in. Let me in. Your sister cut me bad. No! Ow! [Sean grunts] Girls, please stop. [Sean yelling indistinctly] [shucking] Rosie! Jesus! [yells] Jesus Christ! [Sean yelling] [hits] [Sean grunts] [Sean panting] Die! [Sean yells] [hits] [thud] [clattering] Oh, no. [grunts] [tense, dramatic music] No. Hold on, Rosie! I'm comin'! [grunts] [thudding] [grunting] [yells] [grunting] [panting] Don't you die on me, Rosie. [panting] [grunting] [Rosalee coughing] [Sean grunting] Die! [Sean yells] [Sean yelling] [dramatic percussive music] Rosie. Are you okay? Rosie. [Sean grunting] [Sean yelling] Rosie, are you okay? - Rosie? - Rosie, wake up. [Sean gasping] [panting] [Lily] You killed her. [Sean] No. No, I didn't meant to. You have to... - You do- - It's all your fault, Sean! She cut me. She cut my fucking achilles! Come on, call your mom. Call your mom, I love your mom! Mommy doesn't love you. Why? Why are you doing this to me? [dramatic music] No mom for you, Sean. What are you talking about? All I wanna do is take care of you! It's too late. [dramatic music] I wanna be your dad. I don't know what I did, but I'm sorry. Rosalee was our sister. Bye, bye, Sean. No! No! [thuds] [tense, dramatic music] [Mrs. Chase sobbing] You girls, I'm gonna be right back, okay? You stay here. They think Sean killed Rosalee. He did. And Matia. Yeah, her too. But that's not true. [birds chirping] [Richard whines] [Richard grumbles] [Louis] Easy, pal. Easy, Richard. [Richard whining] I'm sorry for your loss, but this isn't right, and you know it. [Richard whining] Sean was my friend. I'd like you to return the ring. What? That belonged to my mother. What good is it to you? - I- - That's enough, Charles. Can't you see that she's also grieving? I'm so sorry, Laura. I don't understand. [Laura] Can I have a minute? [birds chirping] [sniffles] [sighs] [Dahlia] I want to tell mommy what happened. [Violet] She'll forgive us if we say sorry. [Lily] I'm not sorry. [car beeping] [Laura sighs] [rain pattering] [Laura sobbing] I'm so sorry, girls. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. [Violet] No. - It's not your fault. - This is all my fault! Oh my god, Rosalee. [sobbing] [Violet] It's not your fault, mommy. Yes it is, honey. - This is all my fault. - No it's not. Lily, do it. What... [Lily] Mommy, can you make us a promise? Of course I can, honey. What is it? [Lily] That you'll love us forever and never leave? [sobbing] I'm ever, ever gonna leave you girls. [Violet] Say it, please. - What, honey? - Say it, please. Say it. I promise I will love you all forever and I'll never, ever leave you. [Laura sighs] [Lily] Mommy, we stole this. [tense, dramatic music] [rain pattering] [audience applause] And we're back with Officer Brian. Now, you made the arrest of this monster, didn't you? I did. He put up a fight, but he was no match for me. That's amazing. You're very brave. I thank you. Now you've known him for quite some time. When did you first start to suspect that something was a little, you know, a little bit off? Well I think in some respects he was always a bit off. I mean, if I can say it, I don't think he was quite right in the head. [host laughs] Chasing Chase: The Arrest of a Demon. Get the book now. Would you call him a demon? Uh, I would... Yes. Yes he is. [laughing] [tense, dramatic music] [Laura] They saw things, Sean and I together. They thought he was hurting me and that he was going to take me away from them, gone like their father. They just got confused. They, they did terrible things. I knew it! Those girls! You said it was impossible. - You said it was impo- - Tch-tch. Give us a minute. [Laura sobs] [tense, dramatic music] Laura, we don't blame you. You did the right thing by coming here. We can make this right. Yes. You, you have to come forward. You have to clear his name. - Speak the truth- - I can't, I can't. My girls, it will ruin their lives. But Sean deserves justice. Sean deserves better. I can't trade my daughter's lives for his memory. I can't, I can't. I... I won't. This isn't right. I won't let it happen. [slicing] [tense, strange music] Please. Mother to mother, I beg you. [sobs] Mother to mother. Please. I understand. Can't harm my children. [tense, dramatic music] But... If you won't punish them, then I will. [slices] [Laura gasps] [Laura choking] [Mr. Chase gasps] [choking] [blood spurting] [Laura thuds] You crazy bitch. What have you done? Well if she really loved our son, she would have told the truth. You've lost your mind. I'll get a shovel.
